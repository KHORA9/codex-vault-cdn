WILLIAM WALLACE CAMPBELL\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR OF THE LICK OBSERVATORY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF SPECTROSCOPY\r\n\r\nTHUS far our description of the stellar universe has been\r\nconfined to its geometrical properties. A serious study of the\r\nevolution of the stars must seek to determine, first of all,\r\nwhat the stars really are, what their chemical constitutions\r\nand physical conditions are; and how they are related to each\r\nother as to their physical properties. The application of the\r\nspectroscope has advanced our knowledge of the subject by leaps\r\nand bounds. This wonderful instrument, assisted by the\r\nphotographic plate, enables every visible celestial body to\r\nwrite its own record of the conditions existing in itself,\r\nwithin limits set principally by the brightness of the body.\r\nSuch records physicists have succeeded to some extent in\r\nduplicating in their laboratories; and the known conditions\r\nunder which the laboratory experiments have been conducted are\r\nthe Rosetta Stones which are enabling us to interpret, with\r\nmore or less success, the records written by the stars.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the ordinary image of a star, whether\r\nformed by the eye alone, or by the achromatic telescope and the\r\neye combined, contains light of an infinite variety of colors\r\ncorresponding, speaking according to the mechanical theory of\r\nlight, to waves of energy of an infinite variety of lengths\r\nwhich have traveled to us from the star. In the point image of\r\na star, these radiations fall in a confused heap. and the\r\nobserver is unable to say that radiations corresponding to any\r\ngiven wave-lengths are present or absent. When the star's light\r\nhas been passed through the prism, or diffracted from the\r\ngrating of a spectroscope, these rays are separated one from\r\nanother and arranged side by side in perfect order, ready for\r\nthe observer to survey them and to determine which ones are\r\npresent in superabundance and which other ones are lacking\r\nwholly or in part. The following comparison is a fair one: the\r\nordinary point image of a star is as if all the books in the\r\nuniversity library were thrown together in a disorderly but\r\ncompact pile in the center of the reading room: we could say\r\nlittle concerning the contents and characteristics of that\r\nlibrary; whether it is strong in certain fields of human\r\nendeavor, or weak in other fields. The spectrum of a star is as\r\nthe same library when the books are arranged on the shelves in\r\ncomplete perfection and simplicity, so that he who looks may\r\nappraise its contents at any or all points. Let us consider the\r\nfundamental principles of spectroscopy.\r\n\r\n1. When a solid body, a liquid, or a highly-condensed gas is\r\nheated to incandescence, its light when passed through a\r\nspectroscope forms a continuous spectrum: that is, a band of\r\nlight, red at one end and violet at the other, uninterrupted by\r\neither dark or bright lines.\r\n\r\n2. The light from the incandescent gas or vapor of a chemical\r\nelement, passed through a spectroscope, forms a bright-line\r\nspectrum; that is, one consisting entirely of isolated bright\r\nlines, distributed differently throughout the spectrum for the\r\ndifferent elements, or of bright lines superimposed upon a\r\nrelatively faint continuous spectrum.\r\n\r\n3. If radiations from a continuous-spectrum source pass through\r\ncooler gases or vapors before entering the spectroscope, a\r\ndark-line spectrum results: that is, the positions which the\r\nbright lines in the spectra of the vapors and gases would have\r\nare occupied by dark or absorption lines. These are frequently\r\nspoken of as Fraunhofer lines.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: the gases and vapors forming the outer strata of\r\nthe Sun's atmosphere would in themselves produce bright-line\r\nspectra of the elements involved. If these gases and vapors\r\ncould in effect be removed, without changing underlying\r\nconditions, the remaining condensed body of the Sun should have\r\na continuous spectrum. The cooler overlying gases and vapors\r\nabsorb those radiations from the deeper and hotter sources\r\nwhich the gases and vapors would themselves emit, and thus form\r\nthe dark-line spectrum of the Sun. The stretches of spectrum\r\nbetween the dark lines are of course continuous-spectrum\r\nradiations.\r\n\r\nThese principles are illustrated in Fig. 12. The essential\r\nparts of a spectroscope are the slit--an opening perhaps\r\n1/100th of an inch wide and 1/10th of an inch long--to admit\r\nthe light properly; a lens to render the light rays parallel\r\nbefore they fall upon the prism or grating; a prism or grating;\r\na lens to receive the rays after they have been dispersed by\r\nthe prism or grating and to form an image of the spectrum a\r\nshort distance in front of the eye, where the eye will see the\r\nspectrum or a sensitive dry-plate will photograph it. If we\r\nplace an alcohol lamp immediately in front of the slit and\r\nsprinkle some common salt in the flame the two orange bright\r\nlines of sodium will be seen in the eyepiece, close together,\r\nas in the upper of the two spectra in the illustration. If we\r\nsprinkle thallium salt in the flame the green line of that\r\nelement will be visible in the spectrum. If we take the lamp\r\naway and place a lime light or a piece of white-hot iron in\r\nfront of the slit we shall get a brilliant continuous spectrum\r\nnot crossed by any lines, either bright or dark. Insert now the\r\nalcohol-sodium-thallium lamp between the lime light and the\r\nslit, and the observer will see the two sodium lines and one\r\nthallium line in the same places as before, but as dark lines\r\non a background of bright continuous spectrum, as: illustrated\r\nin the lower of the two spectra. Let us insert a screen between\r\nthe lamp and the lime light so as to cut out the latter, and we\r\nshall see the bright lines of sodium and thallium reappear as\r\nin the upper of the two spectra. These simple facts illustrate\r\nKirchhoff's immortal discovery of certain fundamental\r\nprinciples of spectroscopy, in 1859. The gases and vapors in\r\nthe lamp flame are at a lower temperature than the lime source.\r\nThe cooler vapors of sodium and thallium have the power of\r\nabsorbing exactly those rays from the hotter lime or other\r\nsimilar source which the vapors by themselves would emit to\r\nform bright lines.\r\n\r\nWhen we apply the spectroscope to celestial objects we find\r\napparently an endless variety of spectra. We shall illustrate\r\nsome of the leading characteristics of these spectra as in\r\nFigs. 13 to 18, inclusive, and Figs. 21, 22, 23 and 24. The\r\nspectra of some nebulae consist almost exclusively of isolated\r\nbright lines, indicating that these bodies consist of luminous\r\ngases, as Huggins determined in 1864; but a very faint\r\ncontinuous band of light frequently forms a background for the\r\nbrilliant bright lines. Many of the nebular lines are due to\r\nhydrogen, others are due to helium; but the majority, including\r\nthe two on the extreme right in Fig. 13, which we attribute to\r\nthe hypothetical element nebulium, and the close pair on the\r\nextreme left, have not been matched in our laboratories and,\r\ntherefore, are of unknown origin. Most of the irregular nebulae\r\nwhose spectra have been observed, the ring nebulae, the\r\nplanetary and stellar nebulae, have very similar spectra,\r\nthough with many differences in the details.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] My colleague, Wright, who has been making a study of the\r\nnebular spectra, has determined the accurate positions of about\r\n67 bright nebular lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great spiral nebula in Andromeda has a continuous spectrum\r\ncrossed by a multitude of absorption lines. The spectrum is a\r\nvery close approach to the spectrum of our Sun. It is clear\r\nthat this spiral nebula is widely different from the\r\nbright-line or gaseous nebulae in physical condition. The\r\nspiral may be a great cluster of stars which are approximate\r\nduplicates of our Sun, or there is a chance that it consists,\r\nas Slipher has suggested, of a great central sun, or group of\r\nsuns, and of a multitude of small bodies or particles, such as\r\nmeteoric matter, revolving around the nucleus; this finely\r\ndivided matter being visible by reflected light which\r\noriginates in the center of the system.\r\n\r\nThere is an occasional star, like chi Carinae, whose spectrum\r\nconsists almost wholly of bright lines, in general bearing no\r\napparent relationship to the bright lines in the spectra of the\r\ngaseous nebulae except that the hydrogen lines are there, as\r\nthey are almost everywhere. There is reason to believe that\r\nsuch a spectrum indicates the existence of a very extensive and\r\nvery hot atmosphere surrounding the main body, or core, of the\r\nstar in question. This particular star is remarkable in that it\r\nhas undergone great changes in brilliancy and is located upon a\r\nbackground of nebulosity. The chances are strong that the star\r\nhas rushed through the nebulosity with high rate of speed and\r\nthat the resulting bombardment of the star has expanded and\r\nintensely heated its atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere are the Wolf-Rayet stars, named from the French\r\nastronomers who discovered the first three of this class, whose\r\nspectra show a great variety of combinations of continuous\r\nspectrum and bright bands. We believe that the continuous\r\nspectrum in such a star comes from the more condensed central\r\npart, or core, and that the bright-line light proceeds from a\r\nhot atmosphere extending far out from the core.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the stars have spectra which are\r\ncontinuous, except for the presence of dark or absorption\r\nlines: a few lines in the very blue stars, and an increasing\r\nnumber of lines as we pass from the blue through the yellow and\r\nred stars to those which are extremely red.\r\n\r\nSecchi in the late 60's classified the spectra of the brighter\r\nstars, according to the absorption lines in their spectra, into\r\nTypes I, II III and IV, which correspond: Type I, to the very\r\nblue stars, such as Spica and Sirius; Type II, to the yellow\r\nstars similar to our Sun; Type III, to the red stars such as\r\nAldebaran; and Type IV, to the extremely red stars, of which\r\nthe brightest representatives are near the limit of naked-eye\r\nvision. Secchi knew little or nothing concerning stars whose\r\nspectra contain bright lines, except as to the isolated\r\nbright-line spectra of a few nebulae, and as to the bright\r\nhydrogen lines in gamma Cassiopeia, and his system did not\r\ninclude these.\r\n\r\nOne of the most comprehensive investigations ever undertaken by\r\na single institution was that of classifying the stars as to\r\ntheir spectra, over the entire sky, substantially down to and\r\nincluding the stars of eighth magnitude, by the Harvard College\r\nObservatory, as a memorial to the lamented Henry Draper.\r\nProfessor Pickering and his associates have formulated a\r\nclassification system which is now in universal use. It starts\r\nwith the bright-line nebulae, passes to the bright-line stars,\r\nand then to the stars in which the helium absorption lines are\r\nprominent. The latter are called the helium stars, or\r\ntechnically the Class B stars. The next main division includes\r\nthe stars in which hydrogen absorption is prominent, called\r\nClass A. Classes B and A are blue stars. Then follows in\r\nsuccession Class F, composed of bluish-yellow stars, which is\r\nin a sense a transition class between the hydrogen stars and\r\nthose resembling our Sun, the latter called Class G. The Class\r\nG stars are yellow. Class K stars are the yellowish-red; Class\r\nM, the red; and Class N, the extremely red. Each of these\r\nclasses has several subdivisions which make the transition from\r\none main class to the next main class fairly gradual, and not\r\nper saltum; though it should be said that the relationship of\r\nClass N to Class M spectra is not clear. The illustration, Fig.\r\n17, brings out the principal features of the spectra of Classes\r\nB to M. The spectrum becomes more complicated as we pass from\r\nClass B to the Class M, and the color changes from blue to\r\nextreme red, because the violet and blue radiations become\r\nrapidly weaker as we pass through the various classes.\r\n\r\nGENERAL COURSE OF EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS\r\n\r\nThe general course of the evolutionary processes as applied to\r\nthe principal classes of celestial bodies is thought to be\r\nfairly well known. With very few exceptions astronomers are\r\nagreed as to the main trend of this order, but this must not be\r\ninterpreted to mean that there are no outstanding differences\r\nof opinion. There are, in fact, some items of knowledge which\r\nseem to run counter to every order of evolution that has been\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nThe large irregular nebulae, such as the great nebula in Orion,\r\nthe Trifid nebula, and the background of nebulosity which\r\nembraces a large part of the constellation of Orion, are\r\nthought to represent the earliest form of inorganic life known\r\nto us. The material appears to be in a chaotic state. There is\r\nno suggestion of order or system. The spectroscope shows that\r\nin many cases the substance consists of glowing gases or\r\nvapors; but whether they are glowing from the incandescence\r\nresulting from high temperature, or electrical condition, or\r\notherwise, is unknown, though heat origin of their light is the\r\nsimplest hypothesis now available. Whether such nebulae are\r\noriginally hot or cold, we must believe that they are endowed\r\nwith gravitational power, and that their molecules or particles\r\nare, or will ultimately be, in motion. It will happen that\r\nthere are regions of greater density, or nuclei, here and there\r\nthroughout the structure which will act as centers of\r\ncondensation, drawing surrounding materials into combination\r\nwith them. The processes of growth from nuclei originally small\r\nto volumes and masses ultimately stupendous must be slow at\r\nfirst, relatively more rapid after the masses have grown to\r\nmoderate dimensions and the supplies of outlying materials are\r\nstill plentiful, and again slow after the supplies shall have\r\nbeen largely exhausted. By virtue of motions prevailing within\r\nthe original nebular structure, or because of inrushing\r\nmaterials which strike the central masses, not centrally but\r\nobliquely, low rotations of the condensed nebulous masses will\r\noccur. Stupendous quantities of heat will be generated in the\r\nbuilding-up process. This heat will radiate rapidly into space\r\nbecause the gaseous masses are highly rarefied and their\r\nradiating surfaces are large in proportion to the masses. With\r\nloss of heat the nebulous masses will contract in volume and\r\ngradually assume forms more and more spherical. When the forms\r\nbecome approximately spherical, the first stage of stellar life\r\nmay be said to have been reached.\r\n\r\nIt was Herschel's belief that by processes of condensation,\r\nfollowing the loss of heat by radiation into surrounding space,\r\nformless nebulae gravitated into nebula of smaller and smaller\r\nvolumes until finally the planetary form was reached, and that\r\nplanetaries were the ancestors of stars in general. That the\r\nplanetaries do develop into stars, we have every reason to\r\nbelieve; but that all nebulae, or relatively many nebulae, pass\r\nthrough the planetary stage, or that many of our stars have\r\ndeveloped from planetaries, we shall later find good reason for\r\ndoubting. The probabilities are immensely stronger that the\r\nstars in general have been formed directly from the irregular\r\nnebulae, without the intervention of the planetaries. The\r\nplanetary nebula seem to be exceptional cases, but to this\r\npoint we shall return later.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible, and even probable, that gaseous masses\r\nhave not in all cases passed directly to the stellar state. The\r\nmaterials in a gaseous nebula may be so highly attenuated, or\r\nbe distributed so irregularly throughout a vast volume of\r\nspace, that they will condense into solids, small meteoric\r\nparticles for example, before they combine to form stars. Such\r\nmasses or clouds of non-shining or invisible matter are thought\r\nto exist in considerable profusion within the stellar system.\r\nThe nebulosity connected more or less closely with the brighter\r\nPleiades stars may be a case in illustration. Slipher has\r\nrecently found that the spectra of two small regions observed\r\nin this nebula are continuous, with absorption lines of\r\nhydrogen and helium. This spectrum is apparently the same as\r\nthat of the bright Pleiades stars. Slipher's interpretation is\r\nthat the nebula is not shining by its own light, but is\r\nreflecting to us the light of the Pleiades stars. That this\r\nmaterial will eventually be drawn into the stars already\r\nexisting in the neighborhood, or be condensed into new centers\r\nand form other stars, we can scarcely doubt. The condensation\r\nof such materials to form stars large enough to be seen from\r\nthe great distance of the Pleiades cluster must generate heat\r\nin the process, and cause these stars in their earliest youth\r\nto be substantially as hot as other stars formed directly from\r\ngaseous materials. It is possible, also, that the spiral\r\nnebulae will develop into stars, perhaps each such object into\r\nmany, or some of the larger ones into multitudes, of stars.\r\n\r\nLet us attempt to visualize the conditions which we think exist\r\nin a newly-formed star of average mass. It should be\r\nessentially spherical, with surface fairly sharply defined. Our\r\nSun has average specific gravity of 1.4, as compared with that\r\nof water. The average density of the very young star must\r\ncertainly be vastly lower; perhaps no greater than the density\r\nof our atmosphere at the Earth's surface; it may even be\r\nconsiderably lower than this estimate. The diameter of our Sun\r\nis 1,400,000 kilometers. The diameter of the average young star\r\nmay be ten or twenty or forty times as great. The central\r\nvolume or core of the star is undoubtedly a great deal denser\r\nthan the surface strata, on account of pressure due to the\r\nstar's own gravitational forces. The conditions in the outer\r\nstrata should bear some resemblance to those existing in the\r\ngaseous nebula. The star may or may not have a corona closely\r\nor remotely similar to our Sun's corona. The deep interior of\r\nthe star must be very hot, though not nearly so hot as the\r\ninteriors of older stars; but the surface strata of the young\r\nstar should be remarkably hot; for, being composed of highly\r\nattenuated gases, any lowering of the temperature by radiation\r\ninto surrounding space will be compensated promptly through the\r\nmedium of highly-heated convection currents which can travel\r\nmore rapidly from the interior to the surface than in the case\r\nof stars in middle or old age. Even though the star, as\r\nobserved in our most powerful telescopes, is a point of light,\r\nwithout apparent diameter, its outer strata should supply some\r\nbright lines in the spectrum, because these strata project out\r\nbeyond what we may call the core of the star and themselves act\r\nas sources of light. The spectrum should, therefore, consist of\r\nsome of the bright lines which were observed in the nebular\r\nspectrum, these proceeding from the outer strata of the star;\r\nand of a continuous spectrum made up of radiations proceeding\r\nfrom the deeper strata or core of the star, in which a few dark\r\nlines may be introduced by the absorption from those parts of\r\nthe outer gaseous strata which lie between us and the core.\r\n\r\nA few hundred stellar spectra resembling this description are\r\nwell known, discovered mostly at the Harvard Observatory. Their\r\ndetails differ greatly, but they have certain features in\r\ncommon. The bright lines of helium are extremely rare in stars,\r\nbut they have been observed in a few stellar spectra. The\r\nbright lines of nebulium have never been observed in a true\r\nstar: they and the radiations in the ultra-violet known as at\r\n3726A, seem to be confined to the nebular state; and the\r\nabsorption lines of nebulium have never been observed in any\r\nspectrum. As soon as the stellar state is reached nebulium is\r\nno longer in evidence. Stellar spectra containing bright lines\r\nseem always to include hydrogen bright lines. This is as we\r\nshould expect; hydrogen is the lightest known gas, and it is\r\nprobably the substance which can best exist in the outer strata\r\nof stars in general. The extensive outer strata of very young\r\nstars seem to be composed largely of hydrogen, though other\r\nelements are in some cases present, as indicated by the weaker\r\nbright lines in a few cases. This preference of hydrogen for\r\nthe outermost strata is illustrated by several very interesting\r\nobservations of the nebulae. The nebulium lines are relatively\r\nstrong in the central denser parts of the Orion and Trifid\r\nnebulae, but the hydrogen bright-lines are relatively very\r\nstrong in the faint outlying parts of these nebulae. The\r\nplanetary nebula B.D.--12 degrees.1172 is seen in the ordinary\r\ntelescope to consist of a circular disc (probably a sphere or\r\nspheroid) of light and a faint star in its center. When this\r\nnebula is observed with a slitless spectrograph the hydrogen\r\nand nebulium components are seen as circular discs, but the\r\nhydrogen discs are larger than the nebulium discs. In other\r\nwords, the hydrogen forms an atmosphere about the central star\r\nwhich extends out into space in all directions a great deal\r\nfarther than the nebulium discs extend. The Wolf-Rayet\r\nstar-planetary nebula D. M. + 30 degrees.3639 looks hazy in a\r\npowerful telescope, and when examined in a spectroscope the\r\nhaziness is seen to be due to a sharply defined globe of\r\nhydrogen 5 seconds of arc in diameter surrounding the star in\r\nits center. Wolf and Burns have shown that in the Ring Nebula\r\nin Lyra the 3726A and the hydrogen images are larger as to\r\nouter diameter than the nebulium images, but that the latter\r\nare the more condensed on the inner edge of the ring. Wright\r\nhas in the present year examined these and other nebulae with\r\nspecial reference to the distribution of the principal\r\ningredients. He finds in general that the radiations at 4363A\r\nand 4686A, of unknown or possibly helium origin, are most\r\nclosely compressed around the central nuclei of nebulae; that\r\nthe matter definitely known to be helium is more extended in\r\nsize; that the nebulium structure is still larger; and that the\r\nhydrogen uniformly extends out farther than the nebulium; and\r\nthat the ultra violet radiation at 3726A seems to proceed from\r\nthe largest volume of all. The 37726A line, like the nebulium\r\nline, is unknown in stellar spectra; it seems also to be\r\nconfined to true nebulosity. Neglecting the elements which have\r\nnever been observed in true stars, we may say that all these\r\nobservations are in harmony with the view that hydrogen should\r\nbe and is the principal element in the outer stratum of the\r\nvery young star. A few of the stars whose spectra contain\r\nbright hydrogen lines have also a number of bright lines whose\r\nchemical origin is not known. They appear to exist exactly at\r\nthis state of stellar life: several of them have not been found\r\nin the spectra of the gaseous nebulae, and they are not\r\nrepresented in the later types of stellar spectra. The strata\r\nwhich produce these bright lines are thought to be a little\r\ndeeper in the stars than the outer hydrogen stratum.\r\n\r\nA slightly older stage of stellar existence is indicated by the\r\ntype of spectrum in which some of the lines of hydrogen, always\r\nthose at the violet end, are dark, and the remaining hydrogen\r\nlines, always those toward the red end, are bright. The\r\nbrightest star in the Pleiades group, Alcyone, presents\r\napparently the last of this series, for all of the hydrogen\r\nlines are dark except H alpha, in the red. In some of the\r\nbright-line stars which we have described, technically known as\r\nOe5, Harvard College Observatory found that the dark helium and\r\nhydrogen lines exist, and apparently increase in intensity, on\r\nthe average, as the bright lines become fainter. Wright has\r\nobserved the absorption lines of helium and hydrogen in the\r\nspectra of the nuclei of some planetary nebulae, although the\r\nhelium and hydrogen lines are bright in the nebulosity\r\nsurrounding the nuclei. We may say that when all of the bright\r\nlines have disappeared from the spectra of stars, the helium\r\nlines, and likewise the hydrogen lines, have in general become\r\nfairly conspicuous. These stars are known as the helium stars,\r\nor stars of Class B. Proceeding through the subdivisions of\r\nClass B, the helium lines increase to a maximum of intensity\r\nand then decrease. The dark hydrogen lines are more and more in\r\nevidence, with intensities increasing slowly. In the middle and\r\nlater subdivisions of the helium stars silicon, oxygen and\r\nnitrogen are usually represented by a few absorption lines.\r\n\r\nJust as the gaseous nebulae radiate heat into space and\r\ncondense, so must the stars, with this difference: the nebulae\r\nare highly rarified bodies, with surfaces enormously large in\r\nproportion to the heat contents; and the radiation from them\r\nmust be relatively rapid. In fact, some of the nebulae seem to\r\nbe so highly rarified that radiation may take place from their\r\ninteriors almost as well as from their surfaces. The radiation\r\nfrom a star just formed must occur at a much slower rate. The\r\ncontinued condensation of the star, following the loss of heat,\r\nmust lead to a change of physical condition, which will be\r\napparent in the spectrum. It should pass from the so-called\r\nhelium group, to the hydrogen, or Class A group, not suddenly\r\nbut by insensible gradations of spectrum. In the Class A stars\r\nthe hydrogen lines are the most prominent features. The helium\r\nlines have disappeared, except in a few stars where faint\r\nhelium remnants are in evidence. The magnesium lines have\r\nbecome prominent and the calcium lines are growing rapidly in\r\nstrength. The so-called metallic lines, usually beginning with\r\niron and titanium lines, which have a few extremely faint\r\nrepresentatives in the last of the helium stars, become visible\r\nhere and there in the Class A spectra, but they are not\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nIn the next main division, the Class F spectra, the metallic\r\nlines increase rapidly in prominence, and the hydrogen lines\r\ndecrease slightly in strength. These stars are not so blue as\r\nthe helium and hydrogen stars. They are intermediate between\r\nthe blue stars and the yellow stars, which begin with the next\r\nclass, G, of which our Sun is a representative.\r\n\r\nThe metallic lines are in Class G spectra in great number and\r\nintensity, and the hydrogen lines are greatly reduced in\r\nprominence. The calcium bands are very wide and intense.\r\n\r\nAnother step brings us to the very yellow and the\r\nslightly-reddish stars, known as Class K. These stars are weak\r\nin violet light, the hydrogen lines are substantially of the\r\nsame intensity as the most prominent metallic lines, and the\r\nmetallic lines are more and more in evidence.\r\n\r\nStars in the last subdivisions of the Class K and all of the\r\nClass M stars are decidedly red. In these the hydrogen lines\r\nare still further weakened and the metallic lines are even more\r\nprominent. Their spectra are further marked by absorption bands\r\nof titanium oxide, which reach their maximum strength in the\r\nlater subdivisions of Class M.\r\n\r\nThe extremely red stars compose Class N on the Harvard scale.\r\nTheir spectra are almost totally lacking in violet light, the\r\nmetallic absorption is very strong, and there are conspicuous\r\nabsorption bands of carbon.\r\n\r\nDeep absorbing strata of titanium and carbon oxides seem to\r\nexist in the atmospheres of the Class M and N stars,\r\nrespectively. The presence of these oxides indicates a\r\nrelatively low temperature, and this is what we should expect\r\nfrom stars so far advanced in life.\r\n\r\nThe period of existence succeeding the very red stars has\r\nillustrations near at hand, we think, in Jupiter, Saturn,\r\nUranus and Neptune, and in the Earth and the other small\r\nplanets and the Moon: bodies which still contain much heat, but\r\nwhich are invisible save by means of reflected light.\r\n\r\nThe progression of stellar development, which we have\r\ndescribed, has been based upon the radiation of heat. This is\r\nnecessarily gradual, and the corresponding changes of spectrum\r\nshould likewise be gradual and continuous. It is not intended\r\nto give the impression that only a few types of spectra are in\r\nevidence: the variety is very great. The labels, Class B, Class\r\nA, and so on to Class N, are intended to mark the miles in the\r\nevolutionary journey. The Harvard experts have put up other\r\nlabels to mark the tenths of miles, so to speak, and some day\r\nwe shall expect to see the hundredths labeled. Further, it is\r\nnot here proposed that heat radiation is the only vital factor\r\nin the processes of evolution. The mass of a star may be an\r\nimportant item, and the electrical conditions may be concerned.\r\nA very small star and a very massive star may develop\r\ndifferently, and it is conceivable that there may be actual\r\ndifferences of composition. But heat-radiation is doubtless the\r\nmost important factor.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionary processes must proceed with extreme\r\ndeliberation. The radiation of the heat actually present at any\r\nmoment in a large helium star would probably not require many\r\ntens of thousands of years, but this quantity of heat is\r\nnegligible in comparison with the quantity generated within the\r\nstar during and by the processes of condensation from the\r\nhelium age down to the Class M state. We know that the\r\ncompression of any body against resistance generates or\r\nreleases heat. Now a gaseous star at any instant is in a state\r\nof equilibrium. Its internal heat and the centrifugal force due\r\nto its rotation about an axis are trying to expand it. Its own\r\ngravitational power is trying to draw all of its materials to\r\nthe center. Until there is a loss of heat no contraction can\r\noccur; but just as soon as there is such a loss gravity\r\nproceeds to diminish the stellar volume. Contraction will\r\nproceed more slowly than we should at first thought expect,\r\nbecause in the process of contraction additional heat is\r\ngenerated and this becomes a factor in resisting further\r\ncompression. Contraction is resisted vastly more by the heat\r\ngenerated in the process of contraction than it is by the store\r\nof heat already in evidence. The quantity of heat in our Sun,\r\nnow existing as heat, would suffice to maintain its present\r\nrate of outflow only a few thousands of years. The heat\r\ngenerated in the process of the Sun's shrinkage under gravity,\r\nhowever, is so extensive as to maintain the supply during\r\nmillions of years to come. Helmholtz has shown that the\r\nreduction of the Sun's radius at the rate of 45 meters per year\r\nwould generate as much heat within the Sun as is now radiated.\r\nThis rate of shrinkage is so slow that our most refined\r\ninstruments could not detect a change in the solar diameter\r\nuntil after the lapse of 4,000 or 5,000 years. Again, there are\r\nreasons for suspecting that the processes of evolution in our\r\nSun, and in other stars as well, may be enormously prolonged\r\nthrough the influence of energy within the atoms or molecules\r\nof matter composing them. The subatomic forces residing in the\r\nradioactive elements represent the most condensed form of\r\nenergy of which we have any conception. It is believed that the\r\nsubatomic energy in a mass of radium is at least a million-fold\r\ngreater than the energy represented in the combustion or other\r\nchemical transformation of any ordinary substance having the\r\nsame mass. These radioactive forces are released with extreme\r\nslowness, in the form of heat or the equivalent; and if these\r\nsubstances exist moderately in the Sun and stars, as they do in\r\nthe Earth, they may well be important factors in prolonging the\r\nlives of these bodies.\r\n\r\nSpeaking somewhat loosely, I think we may say that the\r\nprocesses of evolution from an extended nebula to a condensed\r\nnebula and from the latter to a spherical star, are\r\ncomparatively rapid, perhaps normally confined to a few tens of\r\nmillions of years; but that the further we proceed in the\r\ndevelopment process, from the blue star to the yellow, and\r\npossibly but not certainly on to the red star, the slower is\r\nthe progress made, for the radiating surface through which all\r\nthe energy from the interior must pass becomes smaller and\r\nsmaller in proportion to the mass, and the convection currents\r\nwhich carry heat from the interior to the surface must slow\r\ndown in speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HISTORY OF FIJI.\r\n\r\nBY DR. ALFRED GOLDSBOROUGH MAYER\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE Fijians had a well-organized social system which recognized\r\nsix classes of society. (1) Kings and queens (Tuis and Andis).\r\n(2) Chiefs of districts (Rokos). (3) Chiefs of villages,\r\npriests (Betes), and land owners (Mata-ni-vanuas). (4)\r\nDistinguished warriors of low birth, chiefs of the carpenter\r\ncaste (Rokolas), and chiefs of the turtle fishermen. (5) Common\r\npeople (Kai-si). (6) Slaves taken in battle.\r\n\r\nThe high chiefs still inspire great respect, and indeed it has\r\nbeen the policy of the British government to maintain a large\r\nmeasure of their former authority. Thus of the 17 provinces\r\ninto which the group was divided, 11 are governed by high\r\nchiefs entitled Roko Tui, and there are about 176 inferior\r\nchiefs who are the head men of districts, and 31 native\r\nmagistrates. In so far as may be consistent with order and\r\ncivilization these chiefs are permitted to govern in the old\r\npaternal manner, and they are veritably patriarchs of their\r\npeople. The district chiefs are still elected by the land\r\nowners, mata-ni-vanuas, by a showing of hands as of old.\r\n\r\nIndependent of respect paid to those in authority, rank is\r\nstill reverenced in Fiji. Once acting under the kind permission\r\nand advice of our generous friend Mr. Allardyce, the colonial\r\nsecretary, and accompanied by my ship-mates Drs. Charles H.\r\nTownsend, and H. F. Moore, I went upon a journey of some days\r\ninto the interior of Viti Levu, our guide and companion being\r\nRatu Pope Seniloli, a grandson of king Thakombau, and one of\r\nthe high chiefs of Mbau. Upon meeting Ratu Pope every native\r\ndropped his burdens, stepped to the side of the wood-path and\r\ncrouched down, softly chanting the words of the tame, muduo!\r\nwo! No one ever stepped upon his shadow, and if desirous of\r\ncrossing his path they passed in front, never behind him. Clubs\r\nwere lowered in his presence, and no man stood fully erect when\r\nhe was near. The very language addressed to high chiefs is\r\ndifferent from that used in conversation between ordinary men,\r\nthese customs being such that the inferior places himself in a\r\ndefenceless position with respect to his superior.\r\n\r\nIt is a chief's privilege to demand service from his subjects;\r\nwhich was fortunate for us, for when we started down the\r\nWaidina River from Nabukaluka our canoes were so small and\r\noverloaded that the ripples were constantly lapping in over the\r\ngunwale, threatening momentarily to swamp us. Soon, however, we\r\ncame upon a party of natives in a fine large canoe, and after\r\nreceiving their tama Ratu Pope demanded: \"Where are you going\"?\r\nThe men, who seemed somewhat awestricken, answered that it had\r\nbeen their intention to travel up the river. Whereupon Ratu\r\nPope told them that this they might do, but we would take their\r\ncanoe and permit them to continue in ours. To this they acceded\r\nwith the utmost cheerfulness, although our noble guide would\r\nneither heed our protests nor permit us to reward them for\r\ntheir service, saying simply, \"I am a chief. You may if you\r\nchoose pay me.\" In this manner we continued to improve our\r\nsituation by \"exchanging\" with every canoe we met which\r\nhappened to be better than our own, until finally our princely\r\nfriend ordered a gay party of merry-makers out of a fine large\r\nskiff, which they cheerfully \"exchanged\" for our leaky canoes\r\nand departed singing happily, feeling honored indeed that this\r\nopportunity had come to them to serve the great chief Ratu Pope\r\nSeniloli; and thus suffering qualms of conscience, we sailed to\r\nour destination leaving a wake of confusion behind us. Moreover\r\nI forgot to mention that many natives had by Ratu Pope's orders\r\nbeen diverted from their intended paths and sent forward to\r\nannounce the coming of himself and the \"American chiefs.\" Thus\r\ndoes one of the Royal house of Mbau proceed through Fiji.\r\n\r\nAt first sight such behavior must appear autocratic, to say the\r\nleast, but it should be remembered that a high chief has it in\r\nhis power fully to recompense those about him, and this without\r\nthe payment of a penny. Indeed, many intelligent natives still\r\nregret the introduction of money into their land, saying that\r\nall the white man's selfishness had been developed through its\r\nomnipotence. In Fiji to-day there are no poor, for such would\r\nbe fed and given a house by those who lived beside them. The\r\nwhite man's callous brutality in ignoring the appeal of misery\r\nis incomprehensible to the natives of Fiji. \"Progress\" they\r\nhave not in the sense that one man possesses vast wealth and\r\nmany around him struggle helplessly, doomed to life-long\r\npoverty; nor have they ambition to toil beyond that occasional\r\nemployment required to satisfy immediate wants. Yet if life be\r\nhappy in proportion as the summation of its moments be\r\ncontented, the Fijians are far happier than we. Old men and\r\nwomen rest beneath the shade of cocoa-palms and sing with the\r\nyouths and maidens, and the care-worn faces and bent bodies of\r\n\"civilization\" are still unknown in Fiji. They still have\r\nsomething we have lost and never can regain.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to draw a line between personal service such\r\nas was rendered to Ratu Pope and a regular tax (lala) for the\r\nbenefit of the entire community or the support of the communal\r\ngovernment; and the recognition of this fact actuated the\r\nEnglish to preserve much of the old system and to command the\r\npayment of taxes in produce, rather than in money.\r\n\r\nLand tenure in Fiji is a subject so complex that heavy volumes\r\nmight be written upon it. In general it may be said that the\r\nchief can sell no land without the consent of his tribe.\r\nCultivated land belonged to the man who originally farmed it,\r\nand is passed undivided to all his heirs. Waste land is held in\r\ncommon. Native settlers who have been taken into the tribes\r\nfrom time to time have been permitted to farm some of the waste\r\nland, and for this privilege they and their heirs must pay a\r\nyearly tribute to the chief either in produce or in service.\r\nThus this form of personal lala is simply rent. The whole\r\nsubject of land-ownership has given the poor English a world of\r\ntrouble, as one may see who cares to read the official reports\r\nof the numerous intricate cases that have come before the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nFor example, one party based their claims to land on the\r\nhistoric fact that their ancestors had eaten the chief of the\r\noriginal owners, and the solemn British court allowed the\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nBasil Thomson in his interesting work upon \"The Fijians; a\r\nStudy of the Decline of Custom,\" has given an authoritative\r\nsummary of the present status of taxation and land tenure, land\r\nbeing registered under a modification of the Australian Torrens\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect these child-like people from the avarice of\r\nour own race they are not permitted to sell their lands, and\r\nthe greater portion of the area of Fiji is still held by the\r\nnatives. The Hawaiian Islands now under our own rule furnish a\r\nsad contrast, for here the natives are reduced by poverty to a\r\ndegraded state but little above that of peonage. The Fijians.\r\non the other hand, may not sell, but may with the consent of\r\nthe commissioner of native affairs lease their lands for a\r\nperiod of not more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe Fijians appear never to have been wholly without a medium\r\nof exchange, for sperm-whale's teeth have always had a\r\nrecognized purchasing power, but are more especially regarded\r\nas a means of expressing good will and honesty of purpose. A\r\nwhale's tooth is as effective to secure compliance with the\r\nterms of a bargain as an elaborately engraved bond would be\r\nwith us. More commonly, however, exchanges are direct, each man\r\nbringing to the village green his taro, yaqona, yams or fish\r\nand exchanging with his neighbors; the rare disputes being\r\nsettled by the village chief.\r\n\r\nIn traveling you will discover no hotels, but will be\r\nentertained in the stranger's houses, and in return for your\r\nhost's hospitality you should make presents to the chief.\r\nIndeed to journey in good fashion you should be accompanied by\r\na train of bearers carrying heavy bags full of purposed gifts,\r\nand nowhere in the world is the \"rate per mile\" higher than in\r\nPolynesia.\r\n\r\nAs in all communities, including our own world of finance, a\r\nman's wealth consists not only in what he possesses but even\r\nmore so in the number of people from whom he can beg or borrow.\r\nWilkes records an interesting example of this, for he found\r\nthat the rifle and other costly presents he had presented to\r\nKing Tanoa were being seized upon by his (Tanoa's) nephew who\r\nas his vasu had a right to take whatever he might select from\r\nthe king's possessions. Indeed, in order to keep his property\r\nin sight, Tanoa was forced to give it to his own sons, thus\r\nescaping the rapacity of his nephew. The construction of the\r\nBritish law is such that a vasu who thus appropriates property\r\nto himself could  be sued and forced to restore it, but not a\r\nsingle Fijian has yet been so mean as to bring such a matter\r\ninto court.\r\n\r\nAn individual as such can hardly be said to own property, for\r\nnearly all things belong to his family or clan, and are shared\r\namong cousins. This condition is responsible for that absence\r\nof personal ambition and that fatal contentment with existing\r\nconditions, which strikes the white man as so illogical, but\r\nwhich is nevertheless the dominant feature of the social fabric\r\nof the Polynesians, and which has hitherto prevented the\r\nintroduction of \"ideals of modern progress.\" The natives are\r\nhappy; why work when every reasonable want is already supplied?\r\nNone are rich in material things, but none are beggars\r\nexcepting in the sense that all are such. No one can be a\r\nmiser, a capitalist, a banker, or a \"promoter\" in such a\r\ncommunity, and thieves are almost unknown. Indeed, the honesty\r\nof the Fijians is one of those virtues which has excited the\r\ncomment of travelers. Wilkes, who loathed them as \"condor-eyed\r\nsavages,\" admits that the only thing which any native attempted\r\nto steal from the Peacock was a hatchet, and upon being\r\ndetected the chief requested the privilege of taking the man\r\nashore in order that he might be roasted and eaten. Theft was\r\nalways severely punished by the chief; Maafu beating a thief\r\nwith the stout stalk of a cocoanut leaf until the culprit's\r\nlife was despaired of, and Tui Thakau wrapping one in a tightly\r\nwound rope so that not a muscle could move while the wretch\r\nremained exposed for an entire day to the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nDuring Professor Alexander Agassiz's cruises in which he\r\nvisited nearly every island of the Fijis, and the natives came\r\non board by hundreds, not a single object was stolen, although\r\nthings almost priceless in native estimation lay loosely upon\r\nthe deck. Once, indeed, when the deck was deserted by both\r\nofficers and crew and fully a hundred natives were on board, we\r\nfound a man who had been gazing wistfully for half an hour at a\r\nbottle which lay upon the laboratory table. Somehow he had\r\nmanaged to acquire a shilling, a large coin in Fiji, and this\r\nhe offered in exchange for the coveted bottle. One can never\r\nforget his shout of joy and the radiance of his honest face as\r\nhe leaped into his canoe after having received it as a gift.\r\n\r\nEven the great chief Ratu Epele of Mbau beamed with joy when\r\npresented with a screw-capped glass tobacco jar, and Tui Thakau\r\nof Somo somo had a veritable weakness for bottles and possessed\r\na large collection of these treasures.\r\n\r\nIntelligent and well-educated natives who know whereof they\r\nspeak have told me that they desire not the white man's system,\r\nentailing as it does untold privation and heart-burnings to the\r\nmany that the few may enjoy a surfeit of mere material things.\r\nAs the natives say, \"The white man possesses more than we, but\r\nhis life is full of toil and sorrow, while our days are happy\r\nas they pass.\"\r\n\r\nThus in the Pacific life is of to-day; the past is dead, and\r\nthe future when it comes will pass as to-day is passing. Life\r\nis a dream, an evanescent thing, all but meaningless, and real\r\nonly as is the murmur of the surf when the sea-breeze comes in\r\nthe morning, and man awakens from the oblivion of night.\r\n\r\nHoarded wealth inspires no respect in the Pacific, and indeed,\r\nwere it discovered, its possession would justify immediate\r\nconfiscation. Yet man must raise idols to satisfy his instinct\r\nto worship things above his acquisition, and thus rank is the\r\nmore reverenced because respect for property is low. Even\r\nto-day there is something god-like in the presence of the high\r\nchiefs, and none will cross the shadow of the king's house.\r\nEven in war did a common man kill a chief he himself was killed\r\nby men of his own tribe.\r\n\r\nAs it is with property so with relationships. The family ties\r\nseem loosened; every child has two sets of parents, the adopted\r\nand the real, and relationships founded upon adoption are more\r\nrespected than the real. Rank descends mainly through the\r\nmother. The son of a high chief by a common woman is a low\r\nchief, or even a commoner, but the son of a chieftainess by a\r\ncommon man is a chief. Curiously, there are no words in Fijian\r\nwhich are the exact equivalent of widow and widower. In the\r\nMarshall group the chief is actually the husband of all the\r\nwomen of his tribe, and as Lorimer Fison has said in his \"Tales\r\nfrom Old Fiji,\" their designation and understanding of\r\nrelationships suggests that there was once a time when \"all the\r\nwomen were the wives of every man, and all the men were the\r\nhusbands of every woman,\" as indeed was almost the case in\r\nTahiti at the time of Captain Cook's visit to this island.\r\n\r\nThe social customs of Fiji are rarely peculiar to Fiji itself,\r\nbut commonly show their relationship or identity with those of\r\nthe Polynesians or Papuans. Curiously indeed, while the\r\noriginal stock of the Fijians was probably pure Papuan, their\r\nsocial and economic systems are now dominated by Polynesian\r\nideas, and only among the mountain tribes do we find a clear\r\nexpression of the crude Papuan systems of life and thought.\r\nThis in itself shows that under stimulation the Fijians are\r\ncapable of advancement in cultural ideals.\r\n\r\nThis superposition of a Polynesian admixture upon a barbarous\r\nnegroid stock may account for the anomalous character of the\r\nFijians, for in the arts they equalled or in some things\r\nexcelled the other island peoples of the Pacific, and some of\r\ntheir customs approached closely to the cultural level of the\r\nPolynesians, but in certain fundamental things they remained\r\nthe most fiendish savages upon earth. Indeed we should expect\r\nthat contact with a somewhat high culture would introduce new\r\nwants, and thus affect their arts more profoundly than their\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nIn common with all primitive peoples, their names of men and\r\nwomen are descriptive of some peculiarity or circumstance\r\nassociated with the person named. Indeed, names were often\r\nchanged after important events in a person's life, thus our old\r\nfriend Thakombau began life as Seru, then after the coup d'etat\r\nin which he slaughtered his father's enemies and reestablished\r\nTanoa's rule in Mbau he was called Thakombau (evil to Mbau). At\r\nthe time he also received another name Thikinovu (centipede) in\r\nallusion to his stealthiness in approaching to bite his enemy,\r\nbut this designation, together with his \"missionary\" name\r\n\"Ebenezer,\" did not survive the test of usage. Miss Gordon\r\nCumming gives an interesting list of Fijian names translated\r\ninto English. For women they were such as Spray of the Coral\r\nReef, Queen of Parrot's Land, Queen of Strangers, Smooth Water,\r\nWife of the Morning Star, Mother of Her Grandchildren, Ten\r\nWhale's Teeth, Mother of Cockroaches, Lady Nettle, Drinker of\r\nBlood, Waited For, Rose of Rewa, Lady Thakombau, Lady Flag,\r\netc. The men's names were such as The Stone (eternal) God,\r\nGreat Shark, Bad Earth, Bad Stranger, New Child, More Dead\r\nMan's Flesh, Abode of Treachery, Not Quite Cooked, Die Out of\r\nDoors, Empty Fire, Fire in the Bush, Eats Like a God, King of\r\nGluttony, Ill Cooked, Dead Man, Revenge, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the religion of a people we have the most reliable clue to\r\nthe history of their progress in culture and intelligence, for\r\nreligions even when unwritten are potent to conserve old\r\nconceptions, and thus their followers advance beyond them, as\r\ndoes the intelligence of the twentieth century look pityingly\r\nupon the conception of the cruel and jealous God of the Old\r\nTestament, whose praises are nevertheless still sung in every\r\nChristian church. Thus in Tahiti the people were not cannibals,\r\nbut the gods still appeared in the forms of birds that fed upon\r\nthe bodies of the sacrificed. The eye of the victim was,\r\nindeed, offered to the chief, who raised it to his lips but did\r\nnot eat it. In Samoa also where the practice of cannabalism was\r\nvery rare and indulged in only under great provocation, some of\r\nthe gods remained cannibals, and the surest way of appeasing\r\nany god was to be laid upon the stones of a cold oven. In\r\nTahiti and Samoa, while most of the gods were malevolent, a few\r\nwere kindly disposed towards mortals; in Fiji, however, they\r\nwere all dreaded as the most powerful, sordid, cruel and\r\nvicious cannibal ghosts that have ever been conjured into being\r\nin the realm of thought.\r\n\r\nAll over the Pacific from New Zealand to Japan, and from New\r\nGuinea to Hawaii, ancestor-worship forms the backbone of every\r\nreligion as clearly as it did in Greece or Rome. There are\r\neverywhere one or more very ancient gods who may always have\r\nexisted and from whom all others are descended. Next in order\r\nof reverence, although not always in power, come their\r\nchildren, and finally the much more numerous grandchildren and\r\nremote descendants of these oldest and highest gods. Finally,\r\nafter many generations, men of chieftain's rank were born to\r\nthe gods. Thus a common man could never attain the rank of a\r\nhigh chief, for such were the descendants of the gods, while\r\ncommoners were created out of other clay and designed to be\r\nservants to the chiefs.\r\n\r\nBut the process of god-making did not end with the appearance\r\nof men, for great chiefs and warriors after death became kalou\r\nyalo, or spirits, and often remained upon earth a menace to the\r\nunwary who might offend them. Curiously, these deified mortals\r\nmight suffer a second death which would result in their utter\r\nannihilation, and while in Fiji we heard a tale of an old chief\r\nwho had met with the ghost of his dead enemy and had killed him\r\nfor the second and last time; the club which served in this\r\nmiraculous victory having been hung up in the Mbure as an\r\nobject of veneration.\r\n\r\nOf a still lower order were the ghosts of common men or of\r\nanimals, and most dreaded of all was the vengeful spirit of the\r\nman who had been devoured. The ghosts of savage Fiji appear all\r\nto have been malevolent and fearful beings, whereas those of\r\nthe more cultured Polynesians were some of them benevolent. As\r\nEllis says of the Tahitian mythology:\r\n\r\nEach lovely island was made a sort of fairyland and the spells\r\nof enchantment were thrown over its varied scenes. The\r\nsentiment of the poet that\r\n\r\n         \"Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth,\r\n   Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep\"\r\n\r\nwas one familiar to their minds, and it is impossible not to\r\nfeel interested in a people who were accustomed to consider\r\nthemselves surrounded by invisible intelligences, anti who\r\nrecognized in the rising sun, the mild and silver moon, the\r\nshooting star, the meteor's transient flame, the ocean's roar,\r\nthe tempest's blast, or the evening breeze the movements of\r\nmighty spirits.\r\n\r\nThe gods and ghosts of Fiji often entered into the bodies of\r\nanimals or men, especially idiots.\r\n\r\nThus when the Carnegie Institution Expedition arrived at the\r\nMurray Islands in Torres Straits, the scientific staff were\r\nmuch pleased at the decided evidences of respect shown by the\r\nnatives until it came out that the Islanders considered their\r\nwhite guests to be semi-idiots, and hence powerful sorcerers to\r\nbe placated. Fijian religion had developed into the oracular\r\nstage, and the priest after receiving prayers and offerings\r\nwould on occasions be entered into by the god. Tremors would\r\noverspread his body, the flesh of which would creep horribly.\r\nHis veins would swell, his eyeballs protrude with excitement\r\nand his voice, becoming quavering and unnatural, would whine\r\nout strange words, words spoken by the god himself and unknown\r\nto the priest who as his unconscious agent was overcome by\r\nviolent convulsions. Slowly the contortions grew less and with\r\na start the priest would awaken, dash his club upon the ground\r\nand the god would leave him. It may well be imagined that the\r\npriests were the most powerful agents of the chiefs in\r\nforwarding the interests of their masters, for, as in ancient\r\nGreece or Rome, nothing of importance was undertaken without\r\nfirst consulting the oracle.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by multitudes of demons, ghosts, and genii who were\r\npersonified in everything about him, religion was the most\r\npowerful factor in controlling Fijian life and politics. In\r\nfact, it entered deeply into every act the native performed.\r\nThe gods were more monstrous in every way than man, but in all\r\nattributes only the exaggerated counterparts of Fijian chiefs.\r\n\r\nWar was constantly occurring among these gods and spirits, and\r\neven high gods could die by accident or be killed by those of\r\nequal rank so that at least one god, Samu, was thus dropped out\r\nof the mythology in 1847.\r\n\r\nNdengei was the oldest and greatest, but not the most\r\nuniversally reverenced god. He lived in a cavern in the\r\nnortheastern end of Viti Levu, and usually appeared as a snake,\r\nor as a snake's head with a body of stone symbolizing eternal\r\nlife. Among the sons and grandsons of Ndengei were Roko\r\nMbati-ndua, the one-toothed lord; a fiend with a huge tooth\r\nprojecting from his lower jaw and curving over the top of his\r\nhead. He had bat's wings armed with claws and was usually\r\nregarded as a harbinger of pestilence. The mechanic's god was\r\neight-handed, gluttony had eighty stomachs, wisdom possessed\r\neight eyes. Other gods were the adulterer, the abductor of\r\nwomen of rank and beauty, the rioter, the brain-eater, the\r\nkiller of men, the slaughter god, the god of leprosy, the\r\ngiant, the spitter of miracles, the gods of fishermen and of\r\ncarpenters, etc. One god hated mosquitoes and drove them away\r\nfrom the place where he lived. The names and stations of the\r\ngods are described by Thomas Williams, who has given the most\r\ndetailed account of the old religion.\r\n\r\nAs with all peoples whose religion is barbarous, there were\r\nways of obtaining sanctuary and many a man has saved his life\r\nby taking advantage of the tabus which secured their operation.\r\nNo matter how desirous your host might be of murdering you, as\r\nlong as you remained a guest under his roof you were safe,\r\nalthough were you only a few yards away from his door he would\r\neagerly attack you.\r\n\r\nBut not only did the Fijians live in a world peopled by\r\nwitches, wizards, prophets, seers and fortune-tellers, but\r\nthere was a perfect army of fairies which overran the whole\r\nland, and the myths concerning which would have filled volumes\r\ncould they ever have been gathered. The gnome-like spirits of\r\nthe mountains had peaked heads, and were of a vicious, impish\r\ndisposition, but were powerless to injure any one who carried a\r\nfern leaf in his hand.\r\n\r\nSacred relics such as famous clubs, stones possessing\r\nmiraculous powers, etc., were sometimes kept in Fijian temples,\r\nbut there were no idols such as were prayed to by the\r\nPolynesians.\r\n\r\nThe fearful alternatives of heaven and hell were unknown to the\r\nFijians. They believed in an eternal existence for men,\r\nanimals, and even canoes and other inanimate things, but the\r\nfuture life held forth no prospect either of reward for virtues\r\nor punishment for evil acts committed while alive. So certain\r\nwere they of a future life that they always referred to the\r\ndead as \"the absent ones,\" and their land of shades (Mbulu) was\r\nnot essentially different from the world they lived in. Indeed,\r\ntheir chief idea of death was that of rest, for as William's\r\nstates, they have an adage: \"Death is easy: Of what use is\r\nlife? To die is rest.\"\r\n\r\nThere were, however, certain precautions the Fijian felt it\r\nadvisable to take before entering the world to come. If he had\r\nbeen so unfortunate as not to have killed a man, woman or\r\nchild, his duty would be the dismal one of pounding filth\r\nthroughout eternity, and disgraceful careers awaited those\r\nwhose ears were not bored or women who were not tatooed upon\r\nparts covered by the liku. Moreover, should a wife not\r\naccompany him (be strangled at the time of his death) his\r\ncondition would be the dismal one of a spirit without a cook.\r\nThirdly, as one was at the time of death so would the spirit be\r\nin the next world. It was therefore an advantage to die young,\r\nand people often preferred to be buried alive, or strangled,\r\nthan to survive into old age. Lastly and most important, one\r\nmust not die a bachelor, for such are invariably dashed to\r\npieces by Nangganangga, even if they should succeed in elud-\r\ning the grasp of the Great Woman, Lewa-levu, who flaunts the\r\npath of the departed spirits and searches for the ghosts of\r\ngood-looking men. Let us imagine, however, that our shade\r\ndeparts this life in the best of form, young, married, with the\r\nlobes of his ears pierced, not dangerously handsome and a\r\nslayer of at least one human being. He starts upon the long\r\njourney to the Valhalla of Fiji. Soon he comes to a spiritual\r\nPandanus at which he must throw the ghost of the whale's tooth\r\nwhich was placed in his hand at time of burial. If he succeeds\r\nin hitting the Pandanus, he may then wait until the spirit of\r\nhis strangled wife comes to join him, after which he boards the\r\ncanoe of the Fijian Charon and proceeds to Nambanggatai, where\r\nuntil 1847 there dwelt the god Samu, and after his death\r\nSamuyalo \"the killer of souls.\"\r\n\r\nThis god remains in ambush in some spiritual mangrove bushes\r\nand thrusts a reed within the ground upon the path of the ghost\r\nas a warning not to pass the spot. Should the ghost be brave he\r\nraises his club in defiance, whereupon Samuyalo appears, club\r\nin hand, and gives battle. If killed in this combat, the ghost\r\nis cooked and eaten by the soul killer, and if wounded he must\r\nwander forever among the mountains, but if the ghost be\r\nvictorious over the god he may pass on to be questioned by\r\nNdengei, who may consign him either to Mburotu, the highest\r\nheaven, or drop him over a precipice into a somewhat inferior\r\nbut still tolerable abode, Murimuria. This Ndengei does in\r\naccordance with the caprice of the moment and without reference\r\neither to the virtues or the faults of the deceased. Thus of\r\nthose who die only a few can enter the higher heaven for the\r\nGreat Woman and the Soul destroyer overcome the greater number\r\nof those who dare to face them. As for the victims of cannibal\r\nfeasts, their souls are devoured by the gods when their bodies\r\nare eaten by man.\r\n\r\nIn temperament and ambitions the spirits of the dead remained\r\nas they were upon earth, but of more monstrous growth in all\r\nrespects, resembling giants greater and more vicious than man.\r\nWar and cannibalism still prevailed in heaven, and the\r\ncharacter of the inhabitants seems to have been fiendish or\r\ncontemptible as on earth; for the spirits of women who were not\r\ntattooed were unceasingly pursued by their more fortunate\r\nsisters, who tore their bodies with sharp shells, often making\r\nmince-meat of them for the gods to eat. Also the shade of any\r\none whose ears had not been pierced was condemned to carry a\r\nmasi log over his shoulder and submit to the eternal ridicule\r\nof his fellow spirits.\r\n\r\nAltogether, this religion seems to have been as sordid, brutal\r\nand vicious as was the ancestral negroid stock of the Fijians.\r\nConnected with it there was, however, a rude mythology, clumsy\r\nbut romantic, too much of which has been lost; for the natives\r\nof to-day have largely forgotten its stories or are ashamed to\r\nrepeat it to the whites. In recent times the natives have\r\ntended to make their folk-lore conform to Biblical stories, or\r\nto adapt them to conditions of the present day. The interesting\r\nsubject of the lingering influence of old beliefs upon the life\r\nof the natives of to-day has engaged the attention of Basil\r\nThomson in \"The Fijians, a Study of the Decay of Custom.\"\r\n\r\nAs in every British colony, the people are taught to respect\r\nthe law. Sentences of imprisonment are meted out to natives for\r\npersonal offences which if committed by white men would be\r\npunished by small fines, but the reason for this is that in the\r\nold native days such acts were avenged by murder, and it is to\r\nprevent crime that a prison term has been ordained. The natives\r\ntake their imprisonment precisely as boys in boarding school\r\nregard a flogging, the victim commonly becoming quite a hero\r\nand losing no caste among his fellows. Indeed it is a common\r\nsight to see bands of from four to eight stalwart \"convicts\" a\r\nmile or more from the prison marching unguarded through the\r\nwoods as they sing merrily on their way \"home\" to the jail.\r\nOnce I recall seeing two hundred prisoners, all armed with long\r\nknives, engaged in cutting weeds along the roadside, chanting\r\nhappily as they slashed, while a solitary native dressed only\r\nin a waist-cloth and armed only with a club stood guard at one\r\nend of the line, and this not near the prison, but in a lonely\r\nwood fully a mile from the nearest house.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, the British undertook the unique task of civilizing\r\nwithout exploiting a barbarous and degraded race which was\r\ndrifting hopelessly into ruin. They began the solution of this\r\ncomplex problem by arresting the entire race and immuring them\r\nwithin the protecting walls of a system which recognized as its\r\ncardinal principle that the natives were unfit to think or act\r\nfor themselves. For a generation the Fijians have been in a\r\nprison wherein they have become the happiest and best behaved\r\ncaptives upon earth. During this time they have become\r\nreconciled to a life of peace, and have forgotten the taste of\r\nhuman flesh; and while they cherish no love for the white man,\r\nthey feel the might of his law and know that his decrees are as\r\nfinalities of fate. All are serving life sentences to the white\r\nman's will, and the fire of their old ambition has cooled into\r\nthe dull embers of resignation and then died into the apathy of\r\ncontentment with things that are. Worse still, they have grown\r\nfond of their prison world, and the most pessimistic feature in\r\nthe Fijian situation of to-day is the evident fact that there\r\nis almost no discontent among the natives. Old things have\r\nwithered and decayed, but new ambition has not been born.\r\n\r\nIt is in no spirit of criticism of British policy that I have\r\nwritten the above paragraph for it was absolutely necessary\r\nthat the race should \"calm down\" for a generation at least\r\nbefore it could be trusted to arise. Now, however, there are no\r\nmore old chiefs whose memories hark back to days of savagery,\r\nand now for the first and only time has come the critical\r\nperiod in the unique governmental experiment the British have\r\nundertaken to perform, for now is the time when the child must\r\nlearn to walk alone and the support of guardian arms must in\r\nkindness be withdrawn, else there must be nurtured but a\r\ncripple, not a man.\r\n\r\nAmong the generation of to-day the light of a new ambition must\r\nappear in Fiji or the race shall dwindle to its death. No real\r\nprogress has been made by the Fijians; they have received much\r\nfrom their teachers, but have given nothing in return. They are\r\nin the position of a youth whose schooling has just been\r\nfinished, life and action lie before him; will he awaken to his\r\nresponsibility, develop his latent talent, character and power,\r\nand recompense his teachers by achievement, or will he sink\r\ninto the apathy of a vile content?\r\n\r\nThe situation in Fiji is one of peculiar delicacy for the\r\ndesire for better things must arise among the Fijians\r\nthemselves, and should it once appear, the paternalism of the\r\npresent government must be wisely withdrawn to permit of more\r\nand more freedom in proportion as the natives may become\r\ncompetent to think and act rightly for themselves. A cardinal\r\ndifficulty is the unfortunate fact that the natives DESIRE no\r\nchange, and even if individually discontented and ambitious,\r\nthey know of no profession, arts or trades to which they might\r\nturn with hope of fortune. The establishment of manual training\r\nschools wherein money-making trades should be taught, if\r\npossible BY NATIVE teachers, is sorely needed in Fiji.\r\n\r\nAt present there is too little freedom of thought in Fiji; fear\r\nof the chief and of Samuyalo's club has been replaced by fear\r\nof the European and his hell. Free, fearless thought is the\r\nfather of high action, and while their minds remain steeped in\r\nan apathy of dread there can be no soil in which the seed of\r\nindependence can germinate.\r\n\r\nYet it is still possible that the Fijians may attain\r\ncivilization. Of all the archipelagoes of Polynesia, Fiji alone\r\nmay still be called the \"Isles of Hope.\" As one who has known\r\nand grown to love these honest, hospitable, simple people, I\r\ncan only hope that the day is not far distant when a leader may\r\narise among them who will turn their faces toward the light of\r\na brighter sky, and their hands to a worthier task than has\r\never yet been performed in Polynesia.\r\n\r\nYet why civilize them? Often does one ask oneself this\r\nquestion, but the answer comes as the voice of fate, \"they must\r\nattain civilization or they must die.\" Should the population\r\ncontinue to decline at its present rate, the time is imminent\r\nwhen the dark-skinned men of Fiji will be not the natives, but\r\nthe swarming progeny of the coolies of Calcutta.\r\n\r\nNowhere over all the wide Pacific have the natives been more\r\nwisely or unselfishly ruled than in Fiji, yet even here native\r\nlife seems to be growing less and less purposeful year by year.\r\nIn time it is hoped a reaction may set in and that with the\r\ndecline of communism new ambitions may replace the old, but\r\nthen will come the problem of the rich and the poor--a thing\r\nunknown in Fijian life to-day.\r\n\r\nHardly the first lessons in civilization have been taught in\r\nPolynesia, yet who can predict the noon day, should even the\r\nfaintest glow appear in native hope. In former ages the\r\nJapanese were a barbarous insular people, and as in our own\r\ncivilization the traditions and habits of rude Aryan ancestors\r\nstill color our fundamental thoughts so in Japan we find\r\nevidences of a culture essentially similar to that of the\r\nPacific Islands of to-day. The ancient ancestor worship of\r\nJapan is strangely like that of the tropical Pacific with its\r\ngods, the ghosts of long departed chiefs, and its high chief a\r\nliving god to-day. Moreover in the Pacific Islands the house\r\nconsists of but a single room, and such to-day is essentially\r\nthe case in Japan, save only that delicate paper screens divide\r\nits originally unitary floor-space into temporary compartments.\r\nAs in the South Seas, matting still covers the floor of the\r\nJapanese house, its roof is thatched, and is constructed before\r\nthe sides are made, there is no chimney, the fire-place is an\r\nearthen space upon the floor or is sustained within an\r\nartistically molded bronze brazier, the refined descendant of\r\nthe cruder hearth. In Polynesia as in Japan one seats oneself\r\nanywhere in tailor-fashion upon the floor, and upon this floor\r\nthe meals are served, and here one sleeps at night, nor will\r\nthe women partake of food in the presence of the men. In\r\nessential fundamental things of life the Japanese show their\r\nkinship in custom and tradition to the insular peoples of\r\nAsiatic origin now occupying the Pacific, and if Japan has\r\nattained to so great a height in culture and civilization, why\r\nmay we not hope for better days for the South Sea Islanders?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR SELECTION IN THE ANCIENT WORLD\r\n\r\nBY CHANCELLOR DAVID STARR JORDAN\r\n\r\nLELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\"The human harvest was bad!\" Thus the historian sums up the\r\nconditions in Rome in the days of the good emperor, Marcus\r\nAurelius. By this he meant that while population and wealth\r\nwere increasing, manhood had failed. There were men enough in\r\nthe streets, men enough in the camps, menial laborers enough\r\nand idlers enough, but of good soldiers there were too few. For\r\nthe business of the state, which in those days was mainly war,\r\nits men were inadequate.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of this condition we touch again the\r\novershadowing fact in the history of Europe, the effect of\r\n\"military selection\" on the human breed.\r\n\r\nIn rapid survey of the evidence brought from history one must\r\npaint the picture, such as it is, with a broad brush, not\r\nattempting to treat exceptions and qualifications, for which\r\nthis article has no space and concerning which records yield no\r\ndata. Such exceptions, if fully understood, would only prove\r\nthe rule. The evil effects of military selection and its\r\nassociated influences have long been recognized in theory by\r\ncertain students of social evolution. But the ideas derived\r\nfrom the sane application of our knowledge of Darwinism to\r\nhistory are even now just beginning to penetrate the current\r\nliterature of war and peace. In public affairs most nations\r\nhave followed the principle of opportunism, \"striking while the\r\niron is hot,\" without regard to future results, whether of\r\nfinancial exhaustion or of race impoverishment.\r\n\r\nThe recorded history of Rome begins with small and vigorous\r\ntribes inhabiting the flanks of the Apennines and the valleys\r\ndown to the sea, and blending together to form the Roman\r\nrepublic. They were men of courage and men of action, virile,\r\naustere, severe and dominant.[1] They were men who \"looked on\r\nnone as their superior and none as their inferior.\" For this\r\nreason, Rome was long a republic. Free-born men control their\r\nown destinies. \"The fault,\" says Cassius, \"is not in our stars,\r\nbut in ourselves that we are underlings.\" Thus in freedom, when\r\nRome was small without glory, without riches, without colonies\r\nand without slaves, she laid the foundations of greatness.\r\n\r\n[1] Virilis, austerus, severus, dominous, good old words\r\napplied by Romans to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut little by little the spirit of freedom gave way to that of\r\ndomination. Conscious of power, men sought to exercise it, not\r\non themselves but on one another. Little by little this meant\r\naggression, suppression, plunder, struggle, glory and all that\r\ngoes with the pomp and circumstance of war. So the\r\nindividuality in the mass was lost in the aggrandizement of the\r\nfew. Independence was swallowed up in ambition and patriotism\r\ncame to have a new meaning, being transferred from hearth and\r\nhome to the camp and the army.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent history of Rome, we have now to consider only\r\na single factor, the reversal of selection.\" In Rome's\r\nconquests, Vir, the real man, went forth to battle and foreign\r\ninvasion; Homo, the human being, remained on the farm and in\r\nthe workshop and begat the new generations. \"Vir gave place to\r\nHomo,\" says the Latin author. Men of good stock were replaced\r\nby the sons of slaves and camp-followers, the riff-raff of\r\nthose the army sucked in but could not use.\r\n\r\nThe Fall of Rome was due not to luxury, effeminacy or\r\ncorruption, not to Nero's or Caligula's wickedness, nor to the\r\nfutility of Constantine's descendants. It began at Philippi,\r\nwhere the spirit of domination overcame the spirit of freedom.\r\nIt was forecast still earlier in the rise of consuls and\r\ntriumvirs incident to the thinning out of the sturdy and\r\nself-sufficient strains who brooked no arbitrary rule. While\r\nthe best men were falling in war, civil or foreign, or remained\r\nbehind in faraway colonies, the stock at home went on repeating\r\nits weakling parentage. A condition significant in Roman\r\nhistory is marked by the gradual swelling of the mob, with the\r\nrise in authority of the Emperor who was the mob's exponent.\r\nIncrease of arbitrary power went with the growing weakness of\r\nthe Romans themselves. Always the \"Emperor\" serves as a sort of\r\nhistorical barometer by which to measure the abasement of the\r\npeople. The concentrated power of Julius Caesar, resting on his\r\nown tremendous personality, showed that the days of Cincinnatus\r\nand of Junius Brutus were past. The strength of Augustus rested\r\nlikewise in personality. The rising authority of later emperors\r\nhad its roots in the ineffectiveness of the mob, until it came\r\nto pass that \"the little finger of Constantine was thicker than\r\nthe loins of Augustus.\" This was due not to Constantine's\r\nforce, but to the continued reversal of selection among the\r\npeople over whom he ruled. The emperor, no longer the strong\r\nman holding in check all lesser men and organizations, became\r\nthe creature of the mob; and \"the mob, intoxicated with its own\r\nwork, worshipped him as divine.\" Doubtless the last emperor,\r\nAugustulus Romulus, before the Goths threw him into the\r\nscrap-heap of history, was regarded by the mob and himself as\r\nthe most god-like of the whole succession.\r\n\r\nThe Romans of the Republic might perhaps have made a history\r\nvery different. Had they held aloof from world-conquering\r\nschemes Rome might have remained a republic, enduring even down\r\nto our day. The seeds of Rome's fall lay not in race nor in\r\nform of government, nor in wealth nor in senility, but in the\r\ninfluences by which the best men were cut off from parenthood,\r\nleaving its own weaker strains and strains of lower races to be\r\nfathers of coming generations.\r\n\r\n\"The Roman Empire,\" says Professor Seely, \"perished for want of\r\nmen.\" Even Julius Caesar notes the dire scarcity of men, while\r\nat the same time there were people enough. The population\r\nsteadily grew; Rome was filling up like an overflowing marsh.\r\nMen of a certain type were plenty, but self-reliant farmers,\r\n\"the hardy dwellers on the flanks of the Apennines,\" men of the\r\nearly Roman days, these were fast going, and with the change in\r\ntype of population came the turn in Roman history.\r\n\r\nThe mainspring of the Roman army for centuries has been the\r\npatient strength and courage, capacity for enduring hardships,\r\ninstinctive submission to military discipline of the population\r\nthat lined the Apennines.\r\n\r\n\"The effect of the wars was that the ranks of the small farmers\r\nwere decimated, while the number of slaves who did not serve in\r\nthe army multiplied,\" says Professor Bury. Thus \"Vir gave place\r\nto Homo,\" thus the mob filled Rome and the mob-hero rose to the\r\nimperial throne. No wonder that Constantine seemed greater than\r\nAugustus. No wonder that \"if Tiberius chastised his subjects\r\nwith whips, Valentinian chastised them with scorpions.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[2] The point of this is that the cruel Tiberius was less\r\nsevere on the Romans of his day than was the relatively\r\nbenevolent Valentinian on his decadent people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Marcus Aurelius and the Antonines came a \"period of\r\nsterility and barrenness in human beings.\" Bounties were\r\noffered for marriage. Penalties were devised against\r\nrace-suicide. \"Marriage,\" says Metellus, \"is a duty which,\r\nhowever painful, every citizen ought manfully to discharge.\"\r\nWars were conducted in the face of a declining birth-rate, and\r\nthe decline in quality and quantity in the human breed engaged\r\nvery early the attention of Roman statesmen. Deficiencies of\r\nnumbers were made up by immigration, willing or enforced.\r\nFailure in quality was beyond remedy.\r\n\r\nSays Professor Zumpt:\r\n\r\n'Government having assumed godhead, took at the same time the\r\nappurtenances of it. Officials multiplied. Subjects lost their\r\nrights. Abject fear paralyzed the people and those that ruled\r\nwere intoxicated with insolence and cruelty.... The worst\r\ngovernment is that which is most worshipped as divine. . . .\r\nThe emperor possessed in the army an overwhelming force over\r\nwhich citizens had no influence, which was totally deaf to\r\nreason or eloquence, which had no patriotism because it had no\r\ncountry, which had no humanity because it had no domestic ties.\r\n. . . There runs through Roman literature a brigand's and\r\nbarbarian's contempt for honest industry. . . . Roman\r\ncivilization was not a creative kind, it was military, that is,\r\ndestructive.'\r\n\r\nWhat was the end of it all? The nation bred Romans no more. To\r\ncultivate the Roman fields \"whole tribes were borrowed.\" The\r\nman with quick eye and strong arm gave place to the slave, the\r\nscullion, the pariah, whose lot is fixed because in him there\r\nlies no power to alter it. So at last the Roman world, devoid\r\nof power to resist, was overwhelmed by the swarming Ostrogoths.\r\n\r\nThe barbarian settled and peopled the empire rather than\r\nconquered it. It was the weakness of war-worn Rome that gave\r\nthe Germanic races their first opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"The nation is like a bee,\" wisely observes Bernard Shaw, \"as\r\nit stings it dies.\"\r\n\r\nIn his monumental history of the \"Downfall of the Ancient\r\nWorld\" (Der Untergang der Antikenwelt) Dr. Otto Seeck of the\r\nUniversity of Munster in Westphalia, treats in detail the\r\ncauses of such decline. He first calls attention to the\r\nintellectual stagnation which came over the Roman Empire about\r\nthe beginning of the Christian Era. This manifested itself in\r\nall fields of intellectual activity. No new idea of any\r\nimportance was advanced in science nor in technical and\r\npolitical studies. In the realm of literature and art also one\r\nfinds a complete lack of originality and a tendency to imitate\r\nolder models. All this Seeck asserts, was brought about by the\r\ncontinuous \"rooting out (Ausrottung) of the best\"[3] through\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[3] \"Die Ausrottung der Besten, die jenen schwacheren Volken\r\ndie Vernichtung brachte, hat die starken Germanen erst\r\nbefahigt, auf den Trummern der antiken Welt neue dauerende\r\nGemeinschaften zu errichten.\" Seeck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch extermination which took place in Greece as well as in\r\nRome, was due to persistent internal conflicts, the constant\r\nmurderous struggle going on between political parties, in\r\nwhich, in rapid succession, first one and then the other was\r\nvictorious. The custom of the victors being to kill and banish\r\nthe leaders and all prominent men in the defeated party, often\r\ndestroying their children as well, it is evident that in time\r\nevery strain distinguished for moral courage, initiative or\r\nintellectual strength was exterminated. By such a systematic\r\nkilling off of men of initiative and brains, the intellectual\r\nlevel of a nation must necessarily be lowered more and more. In\r\nRome as in Greece observes Seeck:\r\n\r\n'A wealth of force of spirit went down in the suicidal wars. .\r\n. . In Rome, Marius and Cinna slew the aristocrats by hundreds\r\nand thousands. Sulla destroyed the democrats, and not less\r\nthoroughly. Whatever of strong blood survived, fell as an\r\noffering to the proscription of the Triumvirate. . . . The\r\nRomans had less of spontaneous force to lose than the Greeks.\r\nThus desolation came sooner to them. Whoever was bold enough to\r\nrise politically in Rome was almost without exception thrown to\r\nthe ground. ONLY COWARDS REMAINED, AND FROM THEIR BLOOD CAME\r\nFORWARD THE NEW GENERATIONS.[4] Cowardice showed itself in lack\r\nof originality and in slavish following of masters and\r\ntraditions.'\r\n\r\n[4] Author's italics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain authors, following Varro, have maintained that Rome\r\ndied a \"natural death,\" the normal result of old age. It is\r\nmere fancy to suppose that nations have their birth, their\r\nmaturity and their decline under an inexorable law like that\r\nwhich determines the life history of the individual. A nation\r\nis a body of living men. It may be broken up if wrongly led or\r\nattacked by a superior force. When its proportion of men of\r\ninitiative or character is reduced, its future will necessarily\r\nbe a resultant of the forces that are left.\r\n\r\nDr. Seeck speaks with especial scorn of the idea that Rome died\r\nof \"old age.\" He also repudiates the theory that her fall was\r\ndue to the corruption of luxury, neglect of military tactics or\r\nover-diffusion of culture.\r\n\r\n'It is inconceivable that the mass of Romans suffered from\r\nover-culture.[5] In condemning the sinful luxury of wealthy\r\nRomans we forget that the trade-lords of the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries were scarcely inferior in this regard to\r\nLucullus and Apicius, their waste and luxury not constituting\r\nthe slightest check to the advance of the nations to which\r\nthese men belonged. The people who lived in luxury in Rome were\r\nscattered more thinly than in any modern state of Europe. The\r\nmasses lived at all times more poorly and frugally because they\r\ncould do nothing else. Can we conceive that a war force of\r\nuntold millions of people is rendered effeminate by the luxury\r\nof a few hundreds? . . . Too long have historians looked on the\r\nrich and noble as marking the fate of the world. Half the Roman\r\nEmpire was made up of rough barbarians untouched by Greek or\r\nRoman culture.\r\n\r\nWhatever the remote and ultimate cause may have been, the\r\nimmediate cause to which the fall of the empire can be traced\r\nis a physical, not a moral decay. In valor, discipline and\r\nscience the Roman armies remained what they had always been,\r\nand the peasant emperors of Illyricum were worthy successors of\r\nCincinnatus and Calus Marius. But the problem was, how to\r\nreplenish those armies. Men were wanting. The empire perished\r\nfor want of men.'\r\n\r\n[5] \"Damitsprechend hat man das Wort `Ueberkultur' uberhaupt\r\nerfunden, als wenn ein zu grosses Maass von Kultur uberhaupt\r\ndenkbar ware.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a volume entitled \"Race or Mongrel\" published as I write\r\nthese pages, Dr. Alfred P. Schultz of New York, author of \"The\r\nEnd of Darwinism,\" takes essentially the same series of facts\r\nas to the fall of Rome and draws from them a somewhat different\r\nconclusion. In his judgment the cause was due to \"bastardy,\" to\r\nthe mixing of Roman blood with that of neighboring and\r\nsubjective races. To my mind, bastardy was the result and not\r\nthe cause of Rome's decline, inferior and subject races having\r\nbeen sucked into Rome to fill the vacuum left as the Romans\r\nthemselves perished in war. The continuous killing of the best\r\nleft room for the \"post-Roman herd,\" who once sold the imperial\r\nthrone at auction to the highest bidder. As the Romans vanished\r\nthrough warfare at home and abroad, came an inrush of foreign\r\nblood from all regions roundabout. As Schultz graphically\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n'The degeneration and depravity of the mongrels was so great\r\nthat they deified the emperors. And many of the emperors were\r\nof a character so vile that their deification proves that the\r\npost-Roman soul must have been more depraved than that of the\r\nEgyptian mongrel, who deified nothing lower than dogs, cats,\r\ncrocodiles, bugs and vegetables.'\r\n\r\nIt must not be overlooked, however, that the Roman race was\r\nnever a pure race. It was a union of strong elements of\r\nfrontier democratic peoples, Sabines, Umbrians, Sicilians,\r\nEtruscans, Greeks, being blended in republican Rome. Whatever\r\nthe origins, the worst outlived the best, mingling at last with\r\nthe odds and ends of Imperial slavery, the \"Sewage of Races\"\r\n(\"cloaca gentium\") left at the Fall.\r\n\r\nGibbon says:\r\n\r\n'This diminutive stature of mankind was daily sinking below the\r\nold standard and the Roman world was indeed peopled by a race\r\nof pygmies when the fierce giants of the north broke in and\r\nmended the puny breed. They restored the manly spirit of\r\nfreedom and after the revolutions of ten centuries, freedom\r\nbecame the parent of taste and science.'\r\n\r\nBut again, the redeemed Italian was of no purer blood than the\r\npost-Roman-Ostrogoth ancestry from which he sprang. The \"puny\r\nRoman\" of the days of Theodoric owed his inheritance to the\r\ncross of Roman weaklings with Roman slaves. He was not weak\r\nbecause he was \"mongrel\" but because he sprang from bad stock\r\non both sides. The Ostrogoth and the Lombard who tyrannized\r\nover him brought in a great strain of sterner stuff, followed\r\nby crosses with captive and slave such as always accompany\r\nconquest. To understand the fall of Rome one must consider the\r\ndisastrous effects of crossings of this sort. Neither can one\r\noverlook the waste of war which made them inevitable through\r\nthe wholesale influx of inferior tribes. Neither can one speak\r\nof the Roman, the Italian, the Spaniard, the French, the\r\nRoumanian, nor of any of the so-called \"Latin\" peoples as\r\nrepresenting a simple pure stock, or as being, except in\r\nlanguage, direct descendants of those ancient Latins who\r\nconstituted the Roman Republic. The failure of Rome arose not\r\nfrom hybridization, but from the wretched quality on both sides\r\nof its mongrel stock, descendants of Romans unfit for war and\r\nof base immigrants that had filled the vacancies.\r\n\r\nGreece.--Once Greece led the world in intellectual pursuits, in\r\nart, in poetry, in philosophy. A large and vital part of\r\nEuropean culture is rooted directly in the language and thought\r\nof Athens. The most beautiful edifice in the world was the\r\nPeace Palace of the Parthenon, erected by Pericles, to\r\ncelebrate the end of Greece's suicidal wars. This endured 2,187\r\nyears, to be wrecked at last (1687) in Turkish hands by the\r\nChristian bombs of the Venetian Republic.\r\n\r\nBut the glory of Greece had passed away long before the fall of\r\nthe Parthenon. Its cause was the one cause of all such\r\ndownfalls--the extinction of strong men by war. At the best,\r\nthe civilization of Greece was built on slavery, one freeman to\r\nten slaves. And when the freemen were destroyed, the slaves, an\r\noriginal Mediterranean stock, overspread the territory of\r\nHellas along with the Bulgarians, Albanians and Vlachs,\r\nbarbarians crowding down from the north.\r\n\r\nThe Grecian language still lives, the tongue of a spirited and\r\nrising modern people. But the Greeks of the classic period--the\r\nHellenes of literature, art and philosophy--will never be known\r\nagain. Says Mr. W. H. Ireland:\r\n\r\n'Most of the old Greek race has been swept away, and the\r\ncountry is now inhabited by persons of Slavonic descent.\r\nIndeed, there is a strong ground for the statement that there\r\nwas more of the old heroic blood of Hellas in the Turkish army\r\nof Edhem Pasha than in the soldiers of King George.'\r\n\r\nThe modern Greek has been called a \"Byzantinized Slav.\" King\r\nGeorge himself and Constantine his son are only aliens placed\r\non the Grecian throne to suit the convenience of outer powers,\r\nbeing in fact descendants of tribes which to the ancient Greeks\r\nwere merely barbarians.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained that the modern Greeks are in the main the\r\ndescendants of the population that inhabited Greece in the\r\nearlier centuries of Byzantine rule. Owing to the operation of\r\nvarious causes, historical, social and economic, that\r\npopulation was composed of many heterogeneous elements and\r\nrepresented in very limited degree the race which repulsed the\r\nPersians and built the Parthenon. The internecine conflicts of\r\nthe Greek communities, wars with foreign powers, and the deadly\r\nstruggles of factions in the various cities had to a large\r\nextent obliterated the old race of free citizens by the\r\nbeginning of Roman period. The extermination of the Plataeans\r\nby the Spartans and of the Melians by the Athenians during the\r\nPeloponnesian war, the proscription of the Athenian citizens\r\nafter the war, the massacre of the Coreyrean oligarchs by the\r\ndemocratic party, the slaughter of the Thebans by Alexander and\r\nof the Corinthians by Mummius are among the more familiar\r\ninstances of the catastrophes which overtook the civic element\r\nin the Greek cities. The void can only have been filled from\r\nthe ranks of the metics or resident aliens and of the\r\ndescendants of the far more numerous slave population. In the\r\nclassic period four fifths of the population of Attica were\r\nslaves; of the remainder, half were meties In A.D. 100 only\r\nthree thousand free arm-bearing men were in Greece. (James D.\r\nBourchier.)\r\n\r\nThe constant little struggles of the Greeks among themselves\r\nmade no great showing as to numbers compared to other wars, but\r\nthey wiped out the most valuable people, the best blood, the\r\nmost promising heredity on earth. This cost the world more than\r\nthe killing of millions of barbarians. In two centuries there\r\nwere born under the shadow of the Parthenon more men of genius\r\nthan the Roman Empire had in its whole existence. Yet this\r\nempire included all the civilized world, even Greece herself.\r\n(La Pouge.)\r\n\r\nThe downfall of Greece,[6] like that of Rome, has been ascribed\r\nby Schultz to the crossing of the Greeks with the barbaric\r\nraces which flocked into Hellas from every side. These resident\r\naliens, or metics, steadily increased in number as the free\r\nGreeks disappeared. Selected slaves or helots were then made\r\nfree in order to furnish fighting men, and again as these fell\r\ntheir places were taken by immigrants.\r\n\r\n[6] Certain recent writers who find in environment the causes\r\nof the rise and fall of nations, ascribe the failure of Greece\r\nto the introduction in Athens and Sparta of the malaria-bearing\r\nmosquito. As to the facts in question, we have little evidence.\r\nBut while the prevalence of malaria may have affected the\r\ngeneral activity of the people, it could in no way have\r\nobliterated the mental leadership which made the strength of\r\nclassic Hellas, nor could it have injected its poison into the\r\nstream of Greek heredity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true at this day that \"no race inhabits\r\nGreece,\" and the main difference between Greeks and other\r\nBalkan peoples is that, inhabiting the mountains and valleys of\r\nHellas, they speak in dialects of the ancient tongue.\r\nEnvironment, except through selection and segregation, can not\r\nalter race inheritance and the modern \"Greeks\" have not been\r\nchanged by it. Schultz observes:\r\n\r\n'We are told that the Hellenes owed their greatness largely to\r\nthe country it was their fortune to dwell in. To that same\r\ncountry, with the same wonderful coast line and harbors,\r\nmountains and brooks, and the same sun of Homer, the modern\r\nGreeks owe their nothingness.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, it is quite true that the Greece of Pericles\r\nowed its strength to Greek blood, not to Hellenic scenery. When\r\nall the good Greek blood was spent in suicidal wars, only\r\nslaves and foreign-born were left. \" 'Tis Greece, but living\r\nGreece no more.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[7] In contrasting a new race with the old--as the modern\r\nGreeks with the incomparable Hellenes--we must not be unjust to\r\nthe men of to-day whose limitations are evident, contrasted\r\nwith a race we know mainly by its finest examples. In spite of\r\npoverty, touchiness and vanity characteristic of the modern\r\nGreek, there is good stuff in him. He is frank, hopeful,\r\nenthusiastic. The mountain Greek, at least, knows the value of\r\nfreedom, and has more than once put up a brave fight for it.\r\nThe valleys breed subserviency, and the Greeks of Thessaly are\r\nsaid to be less independent than the mountain-born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we do not know that even the first Hellenes of\r\nMycenae were an unmixed race, or that any unmixed races ever\r\nrose to such prominence as to command the world's attention. We\r\ndo know that when war depletes a nation slaves and foreigners\r\ncome in to fill the vacuum, and that the decline of a great\r\nrace in history has always been accompanied by a debasing of\r\nits blood.\r\n\r\nYet out of this decadence natural selection may in time bring\r\nforward better strains, and with normal conditions of security\r\nand peace nature may begin again her work of recuperation.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of Greece we have another count against war,\r\nscarcely realized until the facts of Louvain and Malines, of\r\nRheims and Ypres, have brought it again so vividly before us.\r\nWar respects nothing, while the human soul increasingly demands\r\nveneration for its own noble and beautiful achievements. As I\r\nwrite this, there rise before me the paintings in the \"Neue\r\nPinakothek\" at Munich, representing the twenty-one Cities of\r\nAncient Greece, from Sparta to Salamis, from Eleusis to\r\nCorinth, not as they were, \"in the glory which was Greece,\" not\r\nas they are now, largely fishing hamlets by the blue Aegean\r\nSea, but as ruined arches and broken columns half hid in the\r\nashes of war, wars which blotted out Greece from world history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTI-SUFFRAGISTS AND WAR\r\n\r\nBY ELSIE CLEWS PARSONS\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY\r\n\r\nONE of the most curious of those misstatements of fact and\r\nconfusions of thought the conservative seems even more prone to\r\nmake than the radical has to do with a certain suppositiously\r\nhistorical relation between women and war. It is assumed[1]\r\nthat early society is ever militant and that because of its\r\nmilitarism it excludes women, women not being fighters, not\r\nonly from its government, but from all its privileges, even\r\nmaking of them its drudges and its beasts of burden. And so,\r\nargues the conservative, women are for the same reasons\r\ndisfranchised, and properly disfranchised, to-day. Whether more\r\nor less militant than it was, society is still founded on\r\nforce, and because women are not as strong as men, men will not\r\ngive them the vote. Besides it is only right, since they can\r\nnot fight, they should not vote. It has always been so, and so\r\nit should continue to be, at any rate until war becomes a thing\r\nof the past, and that will never be, you can't change human\r\nnature, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[1] And, let us admit, not merely by the conservative\r\nanti-feminist. As radical and discerning a feminist as Thomas\r\nWentworth Higginson, after asserting that physical strength was\r\nonce \"sole ruler,\" cites in agreement Walter Bagehot's\r\nreference to \"the contempt for physical weakness and for women\r\nwhich marks early society.\" (\"Women and the Alphabet,\" p. 49.\r\nBoston and New York, 1900.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are of course various answers to this militarist\r\nanti-suffrage argument, answers which in spite of the logic of\r\ncurrent events are still likely to be satisfactory or not\r\naccording to previous convictions, but the only point I wish to\r\nchallenge is the appeal in this connection to the past. Let the\r\nmilitarist anti-suffragist assert his belief in government by\r\nforce if he likes, but let him not try to justify it by the\r\nprecedents of primitive life. Nor may he--or she--explain the\r\nexclusion of women to-day as a survival of their subjection in\r\nprimitive society to brute force. The government of primitive\r\nsociety is not based on physical prowess, and although modern\r\nwoman is excluded from men's activities for the same reason as\r\nprimitive woman was excluded, the reason is not muscular\r\ninferiority.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity in the feminist controversies of the last hundred\r\nyears or so that the \"exclusion of women\" did not become a more\r\npopular phrase than the \"subjection of women.\" That term gave a\r\nfallacious twist both to observation and analysis. Primitive\r\nand modern men alike commonly EXCLUDE women, they seldom\r\nsubject them. Similarly, in some societies, children and young\r\npeople, all in fact but the elderly, are treated to methods of\r\nexclusion rather than of subjection.\r\n\r\nEarly society is dominated by the elders; its practices and\r\ncustoms have been determined by them and, in the most primitive\r\nsociety, government is nothing but a gerontocracy, a government\r\nof old men. Even with chieftaincy the council of the elders is\r\nweighty and the heads of households have considerable\r\ninfluence. Are the elders the fighters or raiders of the tribe?\r\nNo, they are its judges, its legislators and, most important of\r\nall, its magicians. Nor is the chief or king the fighter par\r\nexcellence of the tribe. But he too may be and often is the\r\ntribal magician. Through their powers of magic elders and\r\nchiefs are responsible for the weather, for the reproduction of\r\nplants and animals, for the success of the crops, of hunts and\r\ncatches, for the health and general welfare of the people. And\r\nin war? In war they are the most important personages too.\r\nBecause they fight? No, because in war too they make magic;\r\nthey charm the approaches to the village, they \"doctor\" the\r\ntrails or the weapons or the canoes, they make war medicine,\r\nthey invoke and propitiate the war gods. The warriors are the\r\nyounger men, men whose efforts would be vain without the\r\nbacking of their magic-working seniors or chiefs. The elders\r\nmake peace and declare war. And it is at their dictate that the\r\nyoung men take to head-hunting or to raiding or even to\r\nstealing women.\r\n\r\nAs to the subjection of women, what exists of it the elders are\r\nresponsible for. It is they who scare a girl or shame her into\r\nbeing docile. It is they who marry her off against her will, it\r\nis they who set her unending tasks or shut her up in idleness.\r\nIt is they who make her undergo the discomforts or miseries of\r\nwhat we call conventional life or bully her into exile or\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWith this control of girls or women the warriors, the \"standing\r\narmy,\" have little or nothing to do, even less in primitive\r\nlife than in modern. It is the old people, the old women at\r\ntimes as well as the old men. Again it is the old men who are\r\nleaders in the exclusion of the women. In control of the\r\ninitiation of the youths, they separate them from their mothers\r\nor sisters and often decree for the initiates a ceremonial\r\navoidance of all women for a set time. The penalties they\r\nthreaten--sickness, decrepitude, effeminacy--are too dire to\r\npass unheeded. This \"avoidance\" has been explained as due to\r\nthe monopolistic spirit of the elders. With their women they\r\nwant no interference by the youths. But a far more plausible\r\nexplanation, I think, takes the avoidance as a concentration\r\nrite, so to speak, a symbol, if you like, of the life ahead,\r\nthe life in which the boys, \"made\" men, are going to have\r\nlittle to do in public with women. For even after the special\r\navoidance of the initiation period ends, the segregation of the\r\nsexes continues. Men keep together and away from women in their\r\nclub-houses, and in all the places of assembly which are\r\ndifferentiated from the primitive club-house--the church, the\r\ncouncil, the workshop, the gymnasium, the university, the\r\nplay-house. And from all the interests which center in these\r\nplaces men have from time to time excluded women, they have\r\nexcluded them from magic and religion, from arts and letters,\r\nfrom games, from politics and, let me add, from war.\r\n\r\nWhy are men so exclusive? Because--the reason will seem almost\r\ntoo simple, I fear, for acceptance--because now and always men\r\ndo not want to be bothered by women. Women get in our way, they\r\nsay, women are a nuisance. Almost anywhere away from home women\r\nare a nuisance--in church organization, in the university, in\r\nbusiness, etc. Of course if women can be kept apart from us in\r\nthese activities and will stay in their place, if they join an\r\norder of nuns or deaconesses, if they go to a separate college\r\nin the university, if they will become good stenographers, we\r\ndon't mind having their cooperation, we welcome it. Women may\r\neven go to war--as an absolutely separate division of the army,\r\nsaid the men of Dahomi, as non-combatant pahia women or workers\r\nof magic, said the Roro-speaking tribesmen of New Guinea, or as\r\nRed (dross nurses, say the men of Europe and America. If we men\r\ncan be sure women will not interfere with us, we really do not\r\nmind. Women have only to give us that assurance of\r\nnon-interference to make us doubt the assertion we sometimes\r\nmake that in going to war they are interfering with the order\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INTERPRETATION OF SLAVOPHILISM\r\n\r\nBY ARTHUR D. REES\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, PA.\r\n\r\nTHERE are good reasons for believing that the Russians are\r\npractically the greatest peace people in Christendom. They are\r\nthe least commercial in the competitive sense, the least\r\ncapitalistic also, and as a people, the least combative in\r\nEurope, despite the wrecks of warring dynasties that ten\r\ncenturies have left upon their plains and the miscellaneous\r\nstrifes and calamities of all kinds that have beset them.\r\n\r\nAlways expanding along lines of least resistance; absorbing by\r\ncomparatively petty conquests, decaying or scanty peoples;\r\nreaching Kamchatka in the Far East with more ease than she\r\nreached the shores of the Baltic; never flinging her legions\r\nfar and wide victoriously as did Rome, Spain, France or Great\r\nBritain--Russia remains to-day, for the most part, humble, and,\r\nin reality, a conquered people, living, dreaming and preaching\r\na morality born both of this humility and of the physical\r\nenvironment that has helped to foster it. All Muscovy can not\r\nbe judged by those few who live in the saddle--the Cossack\r\npopulation, men and women, numbers only about two million--nor\r\nby the pitiable pageant of despotism the observer beholds in\r\ntheir land: pogroms, poverty, disease, distress, militarism,\r\northodoxy and Pan-Slavism. Russia has a soul in spite of these;\r\na gentle and beautiful soul, only half revealed, and too much\r\nconcealed by her dilapidation and her dilemma; a peaceful soul,\r\nabnormally humble and devout, and in respect to these qualities\r\nunequalled in Christendom.\r\n\r\nSince the age of Vladimir the Holy, \"The Beautiful Sun of\r\nKief,\" in the tenth century, Russia has had the tradition of\r\ninternational peace. Vladimir wandered over the country, sword\r\nand battle ax in hand, like a reincarnation of Thor, armed with\r\nhis mighty and wondrous hammer. Then came his yearning for a\r\nnew religion--something to inspire his life better than\r\nPerun--Russia's old god of thunder--and the other idols, and a\r\nlittle later, the picturesque investigation of his peripatetic\r\ncommissioners having been completed, he became a Christian of\r\nthe Greek church, was baptized with many fine and grand\r\nceremonies, compelled his docile people to do likewise, and,\r\nlike a true Northman that he was--the great grandson of Rurik\r\nof the Baltic wilds--he so impressed his frowsy hordes, half\r\nScythian and half Slav, that now in the hearts of their\r\ndescendants, in their popular songs and legends, in those\r\nconcerning Kief especially--a beautiful and pathetic strain of\r\nmusic eight centuries old--he, Vladimir, is still the central\r\nheroic figure; once a man, but now a kind of god, sent from\r\nHeaven to rule, enlighten and bring peace to his people and be\r\nknown in story and song as \"Vladimir the Holy, the Beautiful\r\nSun of Kief.\"\r\n\r\nAn old chronicle describes for us how his hordes drank their\r\ncup of trembling at his hands. There, around about the low\r\nhills of the southern Dnieper River, probably on the crumbling\r\nsandstone cliffs of Kief--the city, studded with jewel-like\r\nlegends and famed for its \"golden palaces,\" stood his\r\ncandidates for baptism; near by were priests from\r\nConstantinople, gorgeously arrayed, chanting, in strains\r\nunknown to the populace, the Greek church baptismal service.\r\nThen the democratic immersion!--rich man, poor man and all, at\r\nVladimir's command, wade into the baptismal waters, some up to\r\ntheir knees, some to their waists, some to their necks, and,\r\nthus finding a new faith from Heaven, they crossed themselves\r\nfor the first time as the thunder rolled on high! Here is\r\nRussia remembering her Creator in the days of her youth--and\r\nforgetting Him ever since; from then on, Holy Russia! Possibly\r\nHoly Vladimir, at any rate, for becoming, with that ceremony,\r\npeaceable, except for self-defence, he gave up all of his idols\r\nand his aggressive sword. The former he scourged and cast into\r\nthe river, the latter he sheathed in its scabbard. And all this\r\nabout 988--the first peace movement of Holy Russia. The faith\r\nof it, and its vision and dream came early in her history and\r\nhave not yet gone out or been extinguished.\r\n\r\nBefore the next such movement, time enough passed by to give\r\nthe seasons and the winds and rains full opportunity to whittle\r\ndown old Kief's storied sandstone hills. In 1815, the\r\nmuch-expanded realm of Muscovy, then a partner in the holy\r\nalliance, proclaimed under Alexander the First, the ideal of\r\npeace. This Czar declared he would rule as a father over his\r\nchildren and in the interest of \"justice, charity and peace,\"\r\nand, in so doing, created the leading precedent for the peace\r\nprogram of Nicolas the Second.\r\n\r\nAlexander, who in the first half of his reign ruled liberally\r\nfor the days of Napoleonic supremacy, no doubt was sincere in\r\nhis desire to govern in the \"spirit of brotherhood,\" but in the\r\nlatter years of his power, he fell sadly short of this\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nAlexander the Second, the emancipator of forty-six million\r\nserfs, may have had some world peace ideal in mind when he in\r\n1874 promoted a conference in Brussels to codify the usages of\r\nwar, but the reaction from his earlier liberalism was setting\r\nin about this time and, growing worse, led to his assassination\r\nin 1881.\r\n\r\nThe next move in the direction of peace came, as the world\r\nrather well knows, through the present Czar, Nicolas the\r\nSecond, who on ascending the throne in 1894, proclaimed that\r\nRussia would rule in the interests of peace and would cultivate\r\nthe arts of it. In 1898 followed the first call for a World\r\nPeace Conference, and in 1899 came another circular with a\r\nsimilar object.\r\n\r\nBut it is out of the kind heart of Muscovy, and from the\r\ntroubled, humble and penitent soul of Russia that the real\r\npeace movement of her land has arisen. For many centuries\r\ncalamities have been pouring upon her plains, profusely\r\npouring--drought, famine and invasions without number; now\r\nRurik and his Northmen to start the empire out of its\r\nprehistoric lethargy; their dynasty of conquering blood still\r\nsharing in the rulership of the land to-day; now the Tartars,\r\nremnants of whom with their high cheek bones are still visible\r\nin the Baltic provinces; particularly and always and ever\r\npoverty beyond description; poverty, disaster and conquest,\r\nlike triple demons to humiliate the soul of Russia and keep her\r\ndumb for many centuries, except for the beauty of her unending\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nAnd out of these conditions of life has grown the peace\r\nmorality that is native to the Russian people; out of their\r\nsorrows and their conquered plains, out of their broken hearts\r\ntoo, although the economic genesis of it all is very apparent.\r\n\r\nThe Russian people's Russia has ever been under the overlords\r\nheel, downtrodden years without number, and yet it is a land\r\nwhich has never produced a system of military tactics and\r\ntraining--forever dependent for these creations upon her\r\nneighbors; a land which has produced scarcely one great naval\r\nor military commander who to-day holds a place in history as do\r\nthose of other nations; a land whose people have been usually\r\nled to slaughter like sheep by Northman or Teutonic or Polish\r\ngenerals; whose armies have never been noted for their great\r\ncampaigns, and always have been poorly drilled, managed and\r\nfed, and never yet successful in any foreign wars. Surely from\r\nsuch a land as this, no widespread war-morality or\r\nworld-conquering legions could come.\r\n\r\nIn fact the very reverse has come to pass: the philosophy of\r\nSlavophilism has arisen in Muscovy, yet not so much arisen as\r\nit has developed with the Russian soul, not as a thing apart,\r\nbut as a quality thereof, blossoming somehow with all other\r\nRussian things, out of the primitive Scythian darkness. The\r\nrebellious spirit having been crushed out of the generations\r\nsince, what is left but non-resistance? Yet in these latter\r\nyears a resisting spirit, nursed and suckled largely in western\r\nEurope, has falsely made it appear that all Russia was in arms,\r\nstorming with chaotic unity at the church, the state and the\r\narmy, deluging their ancient customs with the destructive and\r\nre-creative might of radicalism. Far and wide of the truth is\r\nthis! Let no one think the vast heart of Russia has changed!\r\nOnly the few have cast away the ancient quiet; only the few\r\nhave the modern consciousness instead of the medieval,\r\ntheocratic one; only the few are not at heart Slavophiles in\r\nfeeling and in morality.\r\n\r\nThis philosophy existed long in the national or social mind\r\nbefore it was crystallized into public doctrines, and exists\r\neven yet largely in its more primitive unworded or instinctive\r\nform, although it was Peter the Great who unconsciously awoke\r\nthe latent and then unexpressed Slavophilic feelings and\r\nmoralities when he, like a civilizing Pied Piper, charmed the\r\nchieftains of industry of Western Europe to follow his trail\r\ninto Muscovy, his \"Empire of Little Villages,\" and there\r\nregenerate them.\r\n\r\nTherefore at about the end of the seventeenth century in\r\nRussia, the \"dumb silent centuries\" gradually became articulate\r\nin expressing their opposition to all things western. This is\r\nthe heart of Slavophilism, and no one can truly fathom the\r\nRussian soul before understanding its philosophy. It is the\r\nMuscovite theory of the simple life, still crying out against\r\nthe Great Peter's work and recalling the devotees of western\r\nculture to its idealization of medieval, theocratic, autocratic\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nDespite this reaction, however, it has a great meaning, a\r\ntender beauty, and a message of depth and power for our western\r\nworld. Primarily Russia is a peasant and an agricultural land,\r\nand there is a colorless monotony in her vast plains. Indeed\r\nland and people are alike; as in the average peasant there is\r\npatience, resignation and submission, so there is in the very\r\nland itself. Open and prostrate it lies beneath the torrid sun\r\nof the south, and the arctic winds of the north; subdued and\r\ndowntrodden for centuries, it and its people have always been\r\nat the mercy of ruthless men and rainless winds.\r\n\r\nThus passive endurance has become one of the saving qualities\r\nof the Russian's soul. The peasant's nature is one that has few\r\nwants and little rebellious power. The Greek church of the\r\nsimple gospel is his and a government of the Czar's will. His\r\npower of self renunciation is one which in Slavophilic thought\r\ngives him true liberty. Therefore ask the followers of this\r\ndoctrine, what need is there of the constitutional liberties of\r\nthe west, or its republics or limited monarchies, or its\r\ndifferences in ecclesiastical faith and structure? Slavophilism\r\ndeclares that Russia has the only true freedom, faith and\r\nbrotherhood, which other lands sadly lack. In addition she has\r\nthe ancient and splendid heritage of the communal land system,\r\nwherein the inherent justice of the Russian peasant's heart is\r\nshown by his voluntary division and re-division of the land\r\namong his brothers at stated times.\r\n\r\nWhat need therefore, Slavophilism asks, for the degenerate\r\njustice of the west? None! Away with Europe then!--the Europe\r\nof competition and gruesome factories! The Europe of\r\ndestructive forces, of greedy land grabbers, of capital and\r\nlabor wars, where society is held together, not as in Russia by\r\nthe ties of affection, brotherhood and communal interest, but\r\nonly by money and greed, and where free thinkers, atheists and\r\nmaterialists abound, whose lives and thoughts would unsettle\r\nthe holy, orthodox feelings of Russia, disturb her ancient\r\nconscience and poison her humility with murmurings of\r\ndiscontent and rebellion.\r\n\r\nAway with the books of the west, too! And its agricultural\r\nimplements! Wooden ploughs instead of chilled steel! Outdoor\r\nwork and not indoor prisons called factories! Peasants working\r\nfor centuries beneath the uncanopied sun, and on the floors\r\nwithout walls, will not let doors and brickwork thumbscrew\r\ntheir souls in confinement thus! Indoors awhile in winter will\r\nthey labor, but spring airs shatter the moralities of the\r\ntime-clock and away to the fields they rush; in the spring to\r\nsow and sing, in the summer to sing again and at the harvest\r\ntime too, and then to plait the bearded stalks into wreaths and\r\ncrown the maidens with sheaths of corn; the hymns for the\r\n\"death of winter\" and the \"birth of spring,\" marriage songs and\r\nfuneral dirges and chants of olden times well intermingled with\r\nthe labor of their hands.\r\n\r\nHerein the poetry of agricultural, peaceable Russia clashes\r\nwith the prosaic efficiency of the west, the efficiency of\r\ncommercial wars, strikes and class struggles which peasant\r\nMuscovy has known so little.\r\n\r\nAnd again, Slavophilism, with its theory of successive\r\ncivilizations, culled perhaps from the philosophy of Hegel,\r\neach civilization superior to its forerunner, comes to show us\r\na vision: the gradual displacement of one type of society by\r\nanother, but continuing what is best in the preceding until\r\nnothing except what is good remains and universal peace\r\nresults, thus portraying the displacement of national\r\ncivilizations by universal ones, from which ultimately an\r\nidealistic world policy will result, and the federation and\r\npeace of men.\r\n\r\nSome Slavophiles saw even in Peter's work a process of\r\nprogressing from nationality to universality. In his time there\r\nwas the same yearning toward its peaceful ideal. The \"Old\r\nRussia\" party wanted Peter to renounce war and conquest.\r\nAlexis, his own murdered son, worked with this element which\r\nwas very largely representative of the nation. To them, St.\r\nPetersburg, then a new and growing capitol, was typical of\r\nchange, unrest and falsity; Moscow was in their hearts the only\r\ncapital, typical of Russia's old comfort and quiet. Many nobles\r\nantagonized Peter, but he swept them aside, imprisoning them or\r\nsending them to the gallows. Like Russia's slight resistance to\r\nRurik and others, and to the Tartars, so was her feebleness\r\nbefore Peter the Great, who was himself, however, by no means\r\nan accomplished military leader, but an enlightened barbarian,\r\ndealing with a people whom writers and observers declare to be\r\nendowed with conspicuous traits of humility, scarcely found in\r\nthe Christian nations of the western world.\r\n\r\nRussian fiction represents its people in the same way.\r\nUnaggressive characters, who talk and think but do not act,\r\nfill its novels; they dream of the great age of the \"Universal\r\nIdea\" that shall come for all and regenerate the \"rotten west,\"\r\nwhere \"rationalism is the original sin\"; the typical west that\r\nSlavophilism condemns--the west of the struggles between the\r\nrulers and the ruled; between Scripture and tradition and the\r\nupper and lower classes. The Slavophile idea, in theory at\r\nleast, leaves no room for this. Christian love and humility and\r\npeasant communes, where rationalism, strife and rebellion are\r\nunknown, must be instituted in the west; then the \"Universal\r\nIdea\" of Russia will create Millennial times. This was the\r\n\"Messianic hope of Slavophilism,\" and perhaps is yet to a great\r\ndegree destined in the minds of its devotees to give the last\r\nfeature to the development of the world, so that the love and\r\nfeeling of the east would appease the discord of the west,\r\ndiluting its discipline and its logic with true religious\r\nintuition and humility, and eventually the idealized\r\nrelationship of autocracy for the Czar and self-government for\r\nthe people--the old system so rudely strained by Peter the\r\nGreat--would permeate the ruled and rulers of the world.\r\n\r\nHere then is Slavophilism! And pacific Russia--the heart and\r\nsoul of her, claiming this to be the true ethical and spiritual\r\nideal for her people, and censoring her upper class, with its\r\nforeign culture, materialism, and infidelity, as being the only\r\nreal traitor to this saving morality of the ancient regime.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent advocates of this philosophy might be\r\nmentioned, first, Constantine Aksakoff, Russia's Rousseau, who\r\nin the middle of the nineteenth century, was a virtuous\r\npropagandist of the doctrine. He earnestly, even religiously,\r\npreached the return of Russia from the allurements of western\r\nEurope, unto her own theory of national salvation, declaring\r\nthat \"the social order of the west is on a false foundation\"\r\nand that Slavophilism would offset its degeneracy, if only\r\nRussia would free herself from the false class leadership for\r\nwhose origin the Great Peter stands the convicted sponsor! Thus\r\nSlavophilism, under the leadership of Aksakoff, instead of\r\nleading forward with the great liberal movement that came after\r\nthe Crimean War, resulting finally in the emancipation of the\r\nserfs, would lead backward to the stagnant hours of medieval\r\nRussia. Then there were no German words to disfigure the\r\nRussian language! Then there were no German divisions of rank\r\namong the officials to strangle life by their formality. No,\r\nnone of these, nor the disturbing importations of Peter; in\r\nAksakoff's variation of the gospel, the Russians are the\r\n\"beyond men\" and need them not. Thus before Peter's reign all\r\nwas Slavophilic!--a religion of the simple Christian gospel, a\r\nchurch considering itself the only true ecclesia, a government\r\nof the Czar's will, a life of passive humility; creating\r\nfreedom of conscience and speech for the peasants, and freedom\r\nof activity and legislation for the rulers, unknown in modern\r\ncorrupted Russia!\r\n\r\nAnd thus was old peaceable-hearted Muscovy of the past\r\ncenturies pictured as the metropolis of true political and\r\nindividual morality.\r\n\r\nHerzen, too, an able pamphleteer in revolutionary things,\r\npreached something similar, crying from his pulpit at home or\r\nin exile, that Russia would solve all her problems and lead the\r\nhuman race by the simplicity of the Slavophile ideal. His early\r\nand rabid westernism was greatly tempered on contact with the\r\nwest. Disillusion and disgust overcame him. The mercantilism of\r\nthe bourgeoisie there drove him into Aksakoff's fold, and he\r\ntoo thereafter found faith alone in the \"regenerative power of\r\nRussia,\" and her system of the mir, the central sun of the\r\nSlavophilic state, the village commune, self-governing and\r\nself-contained. And then from that, this was to ensue: the\r\nwhole world made of village communes as in Russia, perhaps even\r\ntheir log cabins too, and fresh mud to go with them on their\r\nwalls! But this did not deter the vision of these evangelists.\r\nThe commune was to be indefinitely extended; national and\r\ninternational ones were to be organized, all self- governing,\r\nand then would follow as the night the day, universal peace\r\nwherever these communes were found.\r\n\r\nThis is the Utopia Russia has given to the world to stand\r\nbeside Plato's, or Sir Thomas More's or Morris's or Bellamy's.\r\nThis was the dream of pacific Pan-Slavism.\r\n\r\nDostoievsky himself is of it, and is luminous not with a mere\r\nfacet flash of its philosophy but with the whole orb of it. To\r\nhim the Russians \"are more than human, they are pan-human.\"\r\n\r\nCount Tolstoi too must be listed with these preachers. He,\r\nmaking his own shoes and cutting his own and the peasants'\r\ngrain, lived it, showing how he thought the world's work ought\r\nto be done. What were factories or the culture of the west to\r\nhim in later years--Shakespeare or no Shakespeare? Destructive\r\nideals of life. Competition, money and land greed,\r\nself-assertion--all things that are the anthitheses of\r\nSlavophilism--he shunned; mocking the palsied heart and\r\npoisoned ideals of the west, and indeed of the \"upper class\"\r\nsection of his own land as no other Slavophile did. And\r\nfollowing its teaching, he journeyed through self-renunciation\r\nto freedom and communal life, after repentance for his\r\nwanderings, expiation and regeneration.\r\n\r\nDostoievsky, on the other hand, reached this philosophy largely\r\nby being born to it among the humble people who lived it.\r\nMelancholy-minded by nature--a sort of a Russian Dante but\r\nliving in actual infernos and purgatorios, Siberia and prison\r\ncells, he came at last to worship his fellow countrymen and\r\ntheir ideals as almost nothing else in heaven or earth, and\r\nbowed down before them \"as the only remnant left of Christian\r\nhumility, destined by Providence to regenerate the world.\" Here\r\nis Slavophilism in a fervid extreme. \"The Down-trodden and\r\nOffended,\" \"Memoirs of a Dead House,\" \"Crime and Punishment,\"\r\n\"Poor People,\"--these, the titles of his novels, show the\r\npredilections of his own soul. He died in the mystic frenzy of\r\nthis enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHere then, in this philosophy and in the lives of these men, is\r\nsomething of the soul of Russia, beautiful in its humility, yet\r\nnot so humble that it is not ambitious to embrace the world in\r\nthe folding arms of its peace, its communal government and its\r\nmorality. Pan-Slavism of this nature is the only kind that in\r\ntruth can ever come from Russia. Pan-Slavism of the military\r\nsort, with musketry, bribery and all other diabolic black arts,\r\nmiscalled government, rests on such a slim foundation that it\r\nneed be but little apprehended.\r\n\r\nIt was this brotherly humble soul of Russia that greatly helped\r\nto put an end to the Russo-Japanese war: not merely failing\r\nfinances and lack of transportation. The feeling of a kindly\r\npeople for their own and a neighboring race caused widespread\r\nmismanagement, opposition and wholesale desertions from the\r\narmy, among both the officers and the men. The Romanoff family\r\nand official Russia caused the conflict, but human Russia,\r\nhumble and poor, was a great factor in its conclusion.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that a certain number of\r\nSlavophiles are addicted to the military mania, and this form\r\nof their belief is more dangerously reactionary than its\r\nordinary phase. Many of these belong to the bureaucratic caste.\r\nOfficial Russia holds aloft the eagle; human Russia the dove.\r\nOfficial Russia leads the anti-Jewish massacres; human Russia\r\nis very little responsible for pogroms. Ignatieff, \"Father of\r\nLies,\" a bureaucrat of the military Pan-Slavic breed, about\r\n1882, began the worst persecutions against the Jews in the last\r\ngeneration, and possibly Pobiedonosteff, the late procurator of\r\nthe Holy Synod, was the worst offender in this one. The\r\npeaceful feelings of the masses of the people, however, do not\r\nsanction these outbreaks, and Slavophilism of such a sort is\r\nnot the philosophy of the Russian heart, no matter how many\r\npogroms may be enumerated.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore to human Russia that one must look for the true\r\nfeelings of the people; to their faith and deeds, to the\r\nhumility of their devotions, and prostrations before their\r\nnumberless shrines and ikons, to their religious ceremonies in\r\nthe open fields for huge detachments of the army, to the\r\nthousands of their yearly pilgrims to Jerusalem, to their\r\nsuperstitions, their poverty and long-suffering, all of which\r\nattest innate passive endurance and non-resistance, and show\r\ntheir kind of Slavophilism, which all in all, is much more than\r\n\"mere reverence for barbarism.\"\r\n\r\nThe war-time excitement in their cities seemed characteristic\r\nof this national soul: \"Russia is the Mother of Servia\" was the\r\nstreet cry of the marching throngs. It might be added that the\r\nword mother, \"matushka,\" is a prevalent one in expressing their\r\nfeelings. They call their greatest river the \"Mother Volga.\"\r\nConquering Rome said \"Father Tiber\" and the native warriors of\r\nthis continent called the Mississippi the \"Father of Waters.\"\r\nThe difference in these appellations shows the tender quality\r\nof the Russian soul, whose ardent sympathies in July, 1914,\r\nwere greatly aroused by the spectacle of a large nation\r\nattacking a small one, notwithstanding whatever may be said to\r\njustify that deed.\r\n\r\nFinally, however, let it be added, that the one thing that will\r\nrecreate Russia in the image of the west, is capital. Once let\r\nthe vast sums that have invaded Muscovy be put, not to the\r\nautocratic purpose of the official rulers, but into factories,\r\nmines, city subways and transportation of all kinds,\r\nirrigation, canals, agricultural implements and to other\r\nproductive uses, then capitalistic Russia will stand forth\r\nshorn of the Slavophilic simplicities of non-resistance and\r\nhumility. Labor wars, practically unknown hitherto, yet now\r\nbeginning, will occur in much greater number and the peasant\r\nclass, still unified, will be torn asunder by differences in\r\nwealth and interests; the middle class, now very small, will\r\ngrow to large proportions, and many destructive forces will\r\ncome upon the land which has hitherto mocked western Europe\r\nbecause of their presence there.\r\n\r\nThe many centuries of peasant unity, with its beauty of\r\nbrotherhood, affection and communal interests, will come to an\r\nend under such a new regime. Already competitive forces are\r\ndissolving communism in land, and many of the old beauties of\r\nRussia are disappearing. Capitalism will bring with it much\r\nturmoil and strife, unhappiness and death, but also the dawn of\r\nbrighter hours; newer and better cities, cleaner water, better\r\nfood, houses and clothes, and after the stress of its first\r\nattack is over, and Russia has evolved laws and means to\r\ncontrol and socialize the invader, it may be that the old\r\nsimplicities and beauties of life will return, and a greater\r\nand holier Russia will arise, still able to teach and aid in\r\nthe regeneration of the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL TRAINING AS MENTAL TRAINING\r\n\r\nBY DR. J. H. McBRIDE\r\n\r\nPASADENA, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nTHE first duty of a people is to provide for the health of its\r\nchildren. The possible human value of any country fifty years\r\nahead depends chiefly upon what is done by and for its\r\nchildren. They are the future in the making.\r\n\r\nHistory seems to justify the statement of Professor Tyler[1]\r\nthat conquering races have been physically strong races, and\r\nthat nations have failed when they became degenerate.\r\n\r\n[1] Growth and Education,\" J. M. Tyler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDionysius, speaking of the advantage of virility in a nation,\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\nIt is a law of Nature common to all mankind, which no time\r\nshall annul or destroy, that those who have more strength and\r\nexcellence shall bear rule over those who have less.\r\n\r\nThis law applies equally to individuals. Skill, cunning and\r\nreason play their part, but the animal quality of endurance is\r\nalways back of these and is often decisive in a contest.\r\n\r\nDarwin said he had difficulty in applying the law of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest to the facts of the destruction of\r\nGreece until it occurred to him that in this instance the\r\nstrongest was the fittest. Civilized people's have been\r\ndestroyed by ruder races that were physically superior.\r\n\r\nThe children that are now in our schools will take to adult\r\nlife such foundation as heredity has furnished, with the\r\nequipment that society may care to add. We of this day have no\r\ngreater obligation than to prepare these children mentally and\r\nphysically for the duties that maturity may bring. Man did not\r\nescape the physical necessities of the body when he became\r\ncivilized; the advantages of health are as great to-day as when\r\nour forebears lived in tents. Very few of the primitive man's\r\nactivities are left; what he did regularly and from necessity\r\nwe do incidentally, and usually for sport, and yet the demands\r\nupon the energies of man have not been lessened, they have only\r\nbeen changed in form.\r\n\r\nOur educational authorities, though in many instances\r\ninterested in physical development of the young, have not given\r\nthe subject the important place in their program that it\r\ndeserves. This is not wholly due to indifference, but largely\r\nto their ideals that were derived from classical-ascetic\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nIn the medieval ideal the human body was animal and sinful, to\r\nbe despised and repressed. The mind was said to be the\r\nspiritual element in man, representing the immortal part of his\r\nnature, and therefore was the only part worthy of attention in\r\nan educational system. From the fall of the Roman empire to the\r\nlater nineteenth century this ideal dominated education.\r\n\r\nThe medieval universities, including Oxford and Cambridge,\r\nprovided only for mental training. Their education was intended\r\nfor those who were to follow the professions or to become\r\nscholars or gentlemen of leisure. Education was not intended to\r\nprepare the great mass of men for the every-day work of life.\r\n\r\nWhile only indirectly related to my subject, it is interesting\r\nto recall that there was in this country in the early\r\nnineteenth century much opposition to the establishment of\r\ncommon schools for the masses. It was claimed that those who\r\nbelonged to the working classes did not need to be educated.\r\nOur own colleges and universities were originally founded on\r\nthe old classical-ascetic model, so that the spirit of the\r\nmedieval period survived in the educational plan of this\r\ncountry. It is only in recent decades that these institutions\r\nhave begun to depart from the older, formal, classical methods\r\nthat made education a privilege of the few, the average man\r\nbeing deprived of the advantages of the training that he\r\nneeded. Because of this the humble millions of men and women\r\nwho wove and spun, and fed and housed the world were left out\r\nof the educational scheme.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a London weekly paper, which speaks for the\r\nconservative class of England, in discussing certain suggested\r\ninnovations in English higher education, said that the great\r\nmerit of education at Oxford and Cambridge was that it was\r\n\"absolutely useless.\" By this it was probably meant that the\r\neducation was for a chosen few, was not intended to prepare men\r\nfor the practical work of life and was essentially and only an\r\nintellectual and cultural training.\r\n\r\nThe change of attitude that is seen in our day is due chiefly\r\nto two great discoveries: the re-discovery of the human body\r\nand its relation to our mentality and the discovery of the mind\r\nof the child and youth. We have found that man is an animal who\r\ngraduated from caves and dugouts and to whom even barbarism was\r\na lade and great achievement. That the human body was made by\r\nthe experiences of that rude life, and that since then we have\r\nmade no change in it except to stand on two feet. Neither have\r\nwe added one nerve cell or fiber to our brains since the day\r\nwhen the cave was home and uncooked food the daily diet.\r\n\r\nThe conception of man as an animal has led to a study of him as\r\nsuch. Educators as a class now concede that the physical man\r\nmust be considered as an essential part of their scheme, that\r\nthe brain is an organ of the body among other organs, and is\r\nsubject to the same laws and influenced by similar conditions.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the mind upon the body is a commonplace of\r\npsychology, but the influence of the body upon the mind is of\r\nequal importance, though less frequently emphasized.\r\n\r\nWhatever one's theory of the nature of mind, it must be\r\nconsidered in relation to the brain as the organ of its\r\nexpression. The mind has, too, a broader base than the brain,\r\nfor every organ of the body has some share in the mental\r\nfunctions. Every physician knows that physical disease lowers\r\nthe quality of the thinking and, with the exception of a few\r\ngeniuses like Darwin and Leopardi, it makes impossible\r\nintellectual work of a high order. Disorders of the internal\r\norgans rob the brain of nourishment and weaken it, and by\r\nobtruding their morbidness upon it they batter down its\r\nresistances and lower the thinking power.\r\n\r\nThough we can never know the history of man's origin, the lives\r\nof the child and of the wild man help us to understand\r\nsomething of the order of racial development. All the higher\r\nmental faculties grow in the child as they grew in the\r\nrace--out of impulse, instinct, feeling; and from infancy to\r\nmaturity we recapitulate mentally and physically the early\r\nhuman-making stages, short circuiting in twenty years the\r\nrace-process.\r\n\r\nThe life of physical activity that the child leads develops and\r\ncoordinates the brain and the muscular system. In this way the\r\ngreat motor functions are organized in the brain and become\r\npart of the physical basis of mind.\r\n\r\nThe older education that trained the intellect exclusively,\r\nwithout reference to the practical demands of life or the needs\r\nof the body, was inadequate in that it ignored the law of\r\nthinking and doing. It is true that there is much to its\r\ncredit, as many fine spirits have testified. They at least\r\nsurvived it.\r\n\r\nStanley Hall says \"we think in terms of muscular movement,\" and\r\nthis expresses the most important single fact in the mature\r\nmentality. That the mind is largely constituted of memories of\r\nmuscular movements is basic in development.\r\n\r\nThe muscles are the special organs of volition, the one part of\r\nthe body that the mind can directly command and act on. The\r\nmuscles are preeminently the mind's instruments, the visible\r\nand moving part of its machinery. They are thought carriers,\r\nand during the growth period their functional activities are\r\norganized into the mental life. This is why \"we think in terms\r\nof muscular movement,\" and why muscular training supplies a\r\nnatural need of the developing mind.\r\n\r\nThe normal boy says little or nothing of what he thinks, but\r\nmuch of what he is doing or intends to do. He has the motor\r\nmind, the instinct for doing things by which he builds the\r\nbrain and body. It is nature's way of laying the foundation in\r\nthe individual as by the more tedious process of evolution she\r\nlaid it in the race. The mental development of the normal\r\ninfant is indicated by the increasing accuracy and delicacy of\r\nmuscular coordination. The feeble-minded child very early shows\r\nits mental defect in the clumsy use of its muscles. Because of\r\nthe functional relation of the voluntary muscles and the\r\nmentality, physical training is in a large degree mental\r\ntraining. When by such training we give dexterity to muscles of\r\nthe growing person we are making possible better mental\r\ndevelopment; that is, because of this relation of the mind to\r\naction there is a direct mental discipline in the thought-out\r\nprocesses of physical activity. If, then, we make physical\r\ndevelopment a part of our educational process, we are taking\r\nadvantage of race tendencies, we are starting the individual as\r\nnature started the race; we are laying the foundation in the\r\nindividual as it was originally laid in the race; we are\r\nbuilding as the race built.\r\n\r\nExclusively intellectual training may be sufficient for the\r\ngenius or for the few who have great initiative and\r\nintellectual self-confidence, but for the great mass of boys\r\nand girls this training is not sufficient. It does not prepare\r\nthe young for the kind of work that three fourths of them will\r\nhave to do. We are now beginning to recognize this and through\r\nmanual training, vocational guidance, etc., we are teaching\r\nboys and girls how to do things, and this, too, has the\r\nadditional merit of being, in a measure, physical training.\r\n\r\nEducators, until recently, have, in emphasizing the paramount\r\nimportance of mental training, lost sight of the needs of the\r\nbody. Their classical ideals and formal methods made dead\r\nlanguages, mathematics, philosophy etc., the school diet of\r\nboys whose normal hunger was for action, and for learning by\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton, who wrote fairy tales in metaphysics for\r\na generation of Scotchmen, placed these lines over the doorway\r\nof his lecture room.\r\n\r\n               In earth there 's nothing great but Man;\r\n      In Man there 's nothing great but Mind.\r\n\r\nThis sounds well, but it is poor philosophy. There is much in\r\nearth that is great besides man and much in man that is great\r\nbesides his mind. The older type of metaphysician with his\r\nstaggering vocabulary and his bag of \"categories\" has now\r\nchiefly a historic interest. In the modern view the\r\ninterdependence of mind and body is a fundamental fact of life.\r\nAs science reveals the physiologic marvels of the once despised\r\nbody, the latter grows in our respect, for we find that its\r\nseeming humble functions are intimately related to our highest\r\npowers. Sir William's couplet gives a hint of the dominance of\r\nthe classical method of his day. It overemphasized the\r\nimportance of reason and too often converted the youthful mind\r\ninto a rag bag of useless information. The educators of that\r\ntime and since have thought more highly of human reason than\r\nexperience justifies. With their medieval bias for a world of\r\nwill and reason, they drove the young with the whip and spur of\r\nemulation toward what to them seemed the one possible goal,\r\nintellectual achievement.\r\n\r\nWe exaggerate the share that reason has in conduct. In the\r\nhistory of the race, which is epitomized in the life of every\r\nindividual, reason was a late outgrowth of feeling, passion,\r\nimpulse, instinct. It was these older faculties that ruled the\r\nlife of the primitive man who made the race, and it was through\r\nthem that the race gradually rose to reason by what Emerson\r\nwould call the \"spiral stairway of development.\"\r\n\r\nThese functions of impulse and instinct dominate the life of\r\nthe child and they are only a little less potent in the conduct\r\nof us grownups. Much of what we call reason is feeling, and\r\nmuch of our life activities are due to desire, sentiment,\r\ninstinct and habit, which, under the illusion of reason,\r\ndetermine our decisions and conduct. Some one has said that\r\nreason is the light that nature has placed at the tip of\r\ninstinct, and it is certainly true that without these earlier,\r\nbasal faculties reason would be a feeble light. During the\r\ngrowing period these are specially strong, and the important\r\nthing is that they be guided and organized in relation to the\r\nneeds of maturity. In combining mental and physical training we\r\nare in some measure furnishing this guidance, doing\r\nintentionally what nature did originally without design.\r\n\r\nIn the uncivilized state the stress of life was chiefly\r\nphysical. The civilized man has to a large degree reversed this\r\nold order, in that the use of the body is incidental in his\r\nwork, the stress being placed upon the brain. He piles his life\r\nhigh with complexities and in place of life being for\r\nnecessities, and they few and simple, it is largely for\r\ncomforts which we call necessities, and Professor Huxley has\r\nsaid that the struggle for comforts is more cruel than the\r\nstruggle for existence.\r\n\r\nThis stress which is put upon conscious effort in civilization\r\nplaces a new and severe tax upon the brain. It intensifies and\r\nnarrows the range of man's activities; it causes him to\r\nspecialize and localize the strain to a degree that may be\r\ndangerous. It is certainly true that every man has his breaking\r\nstrain, and there is nothing that will raise the limit of\r\nendurance like a strong and well-developed body.\r\n\r\nThe Italian physiologist, Mosso, showed by an ingenious device\r\nthat when a person lying quite still was required to add a\r\ncolumn of figures, blood left the extremities and flowed toward\r\nthe brain. Any emotional state or effort of thought produces\r\nthe same result. This demonstration that we think to our\r\nfingers' ends suggests the importance of a strong body as a\r\nprompt support in mental work.\r\n\r\nAll our work, mental as well as physical, is a test of\r\nendurance, not a test that is spiritual and non-material, but\r\neven in the sphere of the mind it is plainly animal and\r\nphysical. Thinking is primarily a physical process and draws\r\nupon the vital stores of every organ. The energy that makes\r\nclear thinking possible depends largely upon the vigor of the\r\nbody, and to the extent that this fails, the brain functions\r\nsuffer. Therefore, any work, mental or physical, will be better\r\ndone and more easily done if the body is strong. Other things\r\nbeing equal, the intellectual work of the strong man will be\r\nbetter done than similar work by one of equal talent, but who\r\nis not strong.\r\n\r\nBig muscles are not necessary in physical development. Many\r\npeople are not designed for big muscles, and any attempt by\r\nthem to produce a heavy, massive development may do harm. What\r\nis wanted is vigor, skill, muscular readiness and a reawakening\r\nof the old associations of thought and action. Such training\r\ngoes further than thought and action, for it reaches all the\r\norgans and adds immensely to the vital capacity and working\r\npower of the individual.\r\n\r\nThe play instinct of the child is as old as the race, or older,\r\nand is a vitally important factor, not only in physical\r\ndevelopment, but also in mental development. In its destructive\r\nand disorderly activities the child shows the later adult\r\nforces in the formative stage. Old instincts and movements that\r\nwere once self-preservative and of serious meaning to a wild\r\nancestor reappear in the play of children, and, utilized\r\nwisely, may under new form become a valuable possession of the\r\nadult. There is a great big man, in fact, several possible men,\r\ninside every boy. Through his running, jumping, fighting,\r\nswimming, through impulse, instincts and emotions he is seeking\r\nthe man that is in him, and it is by this turbulent and\r\nexperimental course that he finally comes to the order of\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nEvery boy is a vitally coiled up set of springs pressing to be\r\nreleased. Race-old energies are struggling in him for\r\nexpression, and play is the normal way to satisfy the great\r\ndemand. The child may miss some important things and yet get\r\non, but it can not, without severe and lasting harm miss the\r\ninstinctive activities of play.\r\n\r\nIn play and games the young are re-enacting these old muscular\r\ncoordinations and developing mind and body on the old\r\nfoundation. The boy's love of outdoor sports and the adventures\r\nof hunting are significant. Those ancestors of ours who hunted\r\nand fished and shaped with care their arrow heads were\r\ndeveloping a manual skill and thinking power that we inherit.\r\nWe use our muscles for more varied and possibly more finished\r\npurposes, but it is through the patience and practise of their\r\nrude lives that we possess the delicate uses of the hands and\r\nthe finer dexterities of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe boy who goes whistling to the fields, or hunts, or fishes,\r\nor swims, is unconsciously reaching out toward later life and\r\nis preparing for serious and bigger things.\r\n\r\nThe growing formative period of life is the time for good\r\nphysical development. Whatever is gained and fixed then is\r\npermanent, as it becomes a part of the physiological habits of\r\nthe individual. The years before twenty decide the future\r\nenergy stores, and the capacity to endure. Every function\r\nenlarged, every gain of power, is additional storage room for\r\nenergy, to be drawn upon in the coming days of adult stress.\r\n\r\nGood physical development not only gives strength and skill in\r\nthe use of the body, but develops a physiological habit of\r\nsurplus power that may be called quantity of energy. Life is\r\nnot alone in quality, in delicacy of adjustment, in accuracy,\r\nin fineness of feeling; it is also in quantity. The poet who,\r\nwith frail physique and feeble pulse, sits in his quiet retreat\r\nand puts his fine fancies into the rhythms of verse has\r\nquality. But in the stress and rivalry of life that awaits the\r\nmajority of men, there is a need for quantity of energy, such\r\nas enabled a Washington or a Caesar or a Napoleon or a\r\nWellington to shoulder his way through difficulties. These men\r\ncombined quality with quantity and this combination may make,\r\nand often does make, the life of masterful achievement. The\r\nquantity of energy in us average men may make the difference\r\nbetween success and failure.\r\n\r\nMany men fail in life for lack of staying power, for lack of\r\nthat kind of endurance that is furnished by having power in\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nThe strong, confident person who has strength to spare,\r\nreserves of energy, does his work easily and without friction.\r\nHalf the timidities and indecisions of men are chargeable less\r\nto lack of ability than to lack of the physical vigor, the\r\nQUANTITY of energy, which is the driving power of character. In\r\nall the contests of life an important element in success is the\r\nability to endure prolonged stress, to have the reserve energy\r\nthat can be drawn upon and utilized as a driving force. This\r\npower is not alone necessary in the emergencies, the \"short\r\nhauls\" of life, but also in the long hauls that spread the\r\nstrain through greater periods. Many of the failures of life\r\nare due as much to lack of ability to meet prolonged stress as\r\nto lack of experience or intelligence. Men of moderate ability\r\nbut with great powers of endurance often succeed, while men of\r\ngreater talent fail for lack of the ability to endure strain.\r\n\r\nThe man with a weak body and without the self-confidence that\r\nsurplus energy gives is liable to be of uncertain judgment.\r\nSuch a man in the presence of a problem requiring quick\r\ndecision, doubts and hesitates and stands shivering on the\r\nbrink of action while hastening opportunities pass him by.\r\n\r\nMuch of the loose thinking of our time is undoubtedly due to\r\npoor educational drill. In fact the failure of the schools to\r\nteach pupils how to apply the mind and how to think is one of\r\ntheir common reproaches. Inability to use the mind effectively\r\nis also frequently due to a lack of vigor and physical stamina.\r\nA person with poor digestion, or under-developed body, or weak\r\ncirculation has of necessity a badly nourished brain. Such a\r\nbrain, unless it belongs to a genius, will do poor thinking.\r\n\r\nThe mentally trained person who is also physically strong has\r\nthe combination that puts his powers at easy command. He can be\r\njoyously busy doing the impossible because the doing of it has\r\nbeen made easy by training.\r\n\r\nHow much native power there is in all of us that for want of\r\nproper training or sympathetic encouragement never comes to\r\nmaturity! How many of the finer qualities of character that,\r\nfor want of a kindlier climate of cheerful companionship and\r\nwise direction, failed to mature and now lie dead in us! Very\r\nmany people are only partly alive. A large part, and in some,\r\nthe best part, is dead. The capacity they show is probably only\r\na small share of a fine inheritance which, not knowing how to\r\nuse, they allowed to die.\r\n\r\nWe have an instinctive liking for people who are strong and\r\nhealthy. They appeal to us by their robustness and their\r\nconfident display of energy. We do not now need the big muscles\r\nthat were once necessary in wielding spear and battle-axe. We\r\nneed, however, as much as the race ever needed well-developed\r\nbodies and habits of health.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult for us to see that sports and games and\r\nplay help to physical development, but it is not so plain that\r\nthey may be made to develop the best qualities of character.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, however, that all the important elements of\r\ncharacter are tried out in games and sports. Enthusiasm,\r\nself-confidence, the adventurous spirit, alertness, promptness,\r\nunselfishness, cooperation, quick judgment--all these have\r\ntheir training and discipline on the game field. They comprise\r\nthose fundamental native qualities that have gone to make\r\nhumanity what it is. The young should have this training, and,\r\nif of the right kind, it may be made to contribute to the\r\nmaking of the best kind of character. The same quickness and\r\naccuracy of judgment that enable a boy to win a point in\r\nfootball may in later life be used to win a battle or save a\r\nbusiness venture. Beyond this, there is of course gained the\r\nstrong body that makes work easy and stress less difficult to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nHall calls attention to the fact that two generations ago,\r\nJahn, the great builder of German physique, roused the then\r\ndespairing German nation by preaching the gospel of strong\r\nbodies. He created a new spirit in Germany, and the whole\r\nnation was aroused and seized with an enthusiasm for outdoor\r\ngames and sports, and there arose a new cult for the body. His\r\npupils sang of a united fatherland and of a stronger race. The\r\nGermans are in the habit of reminding us that it was about one\r\ngeneration after Jahn that the German Empire was founded and\r\nGermany became a world power.\r\n\r\nEvery argument for the physical training of boys applies with\r\nequal force to girls. Women need to be physically as strong as\r\nmen. No race will remain virile and progressive unless both the\r\nfathers and mothers have the physical stamina that produces\r\nhealthy, vigorous offspring. In this age, when women are going\r\nout into the world to compete with men it is highly important\r\nthat they be physically strong if they are to stand the stress\r\nsuccessfully. It was from rough barbarians, the rude war-loving\r\nTeutonic men and women described by Tacitus, that the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race inherited those splendid qualities of mind and\r\nbody that have made their descendants masters of seas and\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that gymnastics and field sports make\r\ngirls coarse and mannish. The exact opposite has been found to\r\nbe the case. It has been observed in colleges that when young\r\nwomen are properly led, their sports, in place of making them\r\nmannish, have a marked refining influence. They care more for\r\ncorrect posture because this is made one of their tests in\r\nathletic sports. They develop better manners and a new sense of\r\npride in their appearance. They soon learn to avoid slang, loud\r\ntalking and boisterous behavior. In the University of Chicago\r\nwhere they have excellent training, many of the girls have said\r\nthat they came to have a new sense of dignity and to care more\r\nfor their personal appearance.\r\n\r\nThey also develop the finer elements of character, a\r\ncooperative spirit, obedience to commands, patience,\r\nself-confidence, a spirit of comradeship, a democratic attitude\r\nand an appreciation of good qualities in others wherever found.\r\nAll of these esthetic, social and moral qualities, woven into\r\nthe texture of the growing character, and with the vigorous\r\nhealth that the physical training brings, are the best\r\ncontribution to the making of the most effective type of the\r\nwomanly woman. All games and sports and athletics for the young\r\nshould therefore make for refinement and esthetic development.\r\n\r\nThe state needs now, and will always need, men and women who\r\nhave sound bodies and abounding energy.\r\n\r\nThe harsher phases of the human struggle may pass and wars may\r\ncease, but the old contests of races, nations and individuals\r\nwill continue under other forms.\r\n\r\nAs the race grows older life will become more largely mental.\r\nThe increasing complexity of human relations and the more\r\ndelicate adjustments that these relations require will bring a\r\nnew and finer social order that will make higher demands upon\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no evidence that experience or time or training\r\nwill ever change the structure of the brain, it is probable\r\nthat we have as yet but imperfectly utilized our mental\r\npossibilities. Stratton says:\r\n\r\n     Out of the depths of the mind new powers are always\r\nemerging.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] \"Experimental Psychology and Culture,\" George M. Stratton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack of the mental life, and making it possible, are the\r\nenergies of the body, the functioning of the animal in man,\r\nwhich in the brain are changed to the higher uses of the mind.\r\nThe ability to execute, to act effectively, to do and keep\r\ndoing, to do the work of the professional man, the banker, or\r\nthe scientist, all this is primarily physical, and from top to\r\nbottom of man's activities the physical test is applied. With\r\nthe mental and emotional strain of civilized life goes the\r\nphysical strain which is the other half of the struggle, and\r\nwhich now and always is both mental and physical. The Greeks\r\nrecognized this unity of mind and body twenty-five hundred\r\nyears ago and their results remain unmatched by any race.\r\n\r\nThey saw that the thought-out movements of physical training\r\nresulted in mental training and this law of mental development\r\nthrough physical training was a fundamental principle in their\r\neducational plan.\r\n\r\nThe nation that will again make this an ideal will produce a\r\nfiner race of men, and other things equal, will excel in all\r\nthat makes a people great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD JENNER AND VACCINATION\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR D. FRASER HARRIS, M.D., D.Sc.\r\n\r\nDALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY, HALIFAX, N. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE are so exceedingly apt to take our blessings as a matter of\r\ncourse that at the present time a large number of us have quite\r\nforgotten, and some of us have never known, what a terrible\r\ndisease smallpox is and from how much suffering national\r\nvaccination has saved us. But even many of us, who may not be\r\nincluded amongst those who know nothing of smallpox, do come\r\nwithin the group of those who know next to nothing of the life\r\nand work of Dr. Edward Jenner. A number of persons think he was\r\nSir William Jenner, physician to Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nAn infectious or communicable disease is one caused by the\r\nadmission of some form of living matter into the body of a\r\nhuman being or of a lower animal. All diseases are clearly not\r\ncommunicable in the sense that they are due to the presence of\r\nliving things. Indigestion, for instance, I can not communicate\r\nto my neighbor, however serious my dietetic indiscretions.\r\n\r\nNow, while the actual microorganisms causing many of the\r\ninfectious diseases have been discovered in these recent days\r\nthrough the agency of the microscope--one of science's most\r\nvaluable gifts to suffering humanity--a few diseases\r\nundoubtedly infectious have, even up to the present time, not\r\nhad their microorganic causes discovered. Smallpox or variola\r\nis one of these. The term variola is from the Latin varus, a\r\npimple.\r\n\r\nThe name Small Pox, which first occurs in Holinshead's\r\n\"Chronicle\" (1571), was given to this disease to distinguish it\r\nfrom the Great Pox or syphilis, the French disease, or Morbus\r\nGallicus which attained the proportions of an epidemic in\r\nEurope about 1494. The expression \"The Pox\" in the older\r\nmedical literature always refers to the Lues Venereal The word\r\n\"pox\" is the plural form of pock; the spelling \"pox\" is\r\nphonetic; \"pocks\" is the correct form.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Thus the following expression in Galt's \"Annals of the\r\nParish\" is justified--\"My son Gilbert was seized with the\r\nsmallpox and was blinded by THEM for seventeen days.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox is unquestionably a highly infectious or communicable\r\ndisease, and in the language of a past day, there is a virus or\r\npoison which can pass from the sick to the unaffected; when\r\nthis transference occurs on a large scale we speak of an\r\nepidemic of smallpox. As Sir William Osler truly says, \"It is\r\nnot a little remarkable that in a disease, which is rightly\r\nregarded as the type of all infectious maladies, the specific\r\nvirus still remains unknown.\" The same, however, is true of the\r\ncommon diseases of scarlatina, measles and chickenpox. Of some\r\ndiseases, the virus is a bacillus or coccus, excessively minute\r\nfungi recognizable only under the microscope; but the\r\nbacteriologists are now beginning to speak of viruses so\r\nimpalpable that they, unlike ordinary bacteria, can go through\r\nthe pores of a clay filter, are filter-passers, that is are of\r\nultra-microscopic dimensions. Some authorities conjecture that\r\nthe virus of variola belongs to the group of filter-passers.\r\nThe virus of smallpox, however, is very resistant and can be\r\ncarried through the air for considerable distances; it clings\r\nfor long periods to clothes, books, furniture, etc.\r\n\r\nI shall not now digress to give the clinical details of a case\r\nof smallpox; the eruption may be slight or it may be very\r\nextensive. It occurs in three forms, discrete, confluent and\r\nhemorrhagic. The most dangerous form of smallpox is the\r\nconfluent, in which the face and arms particularly are covered\r\nwith large pustular areas of a most disfiguring appearance.\r\n\r\nThe disease called chickenpox, or varicella, has no\r\nrelationship to smallpox and does not protect from it, nor does\r\nsmallpox protect from chickenpox.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF SMALLPOX\r\n\r\nThere seems very little doubt that the home of smallpox was\r\nsomewhere on the continent of Africa, although it is true that\r\nthere are traditions pointing to its existence in Hindustan at\r\nleast 1000 B.C. One Hindu account alludes to an ointment for\r\nremoving the cicatrices of eruption. Africa has certainly for\r\nlong been a prolific source of it: every time a fresh batch of\r\nslaves was brought over to the United States of America there\r\nwas a fresh outbreak of smallpox.[2] It seems that the first\r\noutbreak in Europe in the Christian era was in the latter half\r\nof the sixth century, when it traveled from Arabia, visiting\r\nEgypt on the way. The earliest definite statements about it\r\ncome from Arabia and are contained in an Arabic manuscript now\r\nin the University of Leyden, which refers to the years A.D. 570\r\nand 571. There is a good deal of evidence that the Arabs\r\nintroduced smallpox into Egypt at the sacking of Alexandria in\r\nA.D. 640. Pilgrims and merchants distributed it throughout\r\nSyria and Palestine and along the north of Africa; then,\r\ncrossing the Mediterranean, they took it over to Italy. The\r\nMoors introduced it into Spain whence, via Portugal, Navarre,\r\nLanguedoc and Guienne it was carried into western and northern\r\nEurope. The earliest physician to describe smallpox is Ahrun, a\r\nChristian Egyptian, who wrote in Greek. He lived in Alexandria\r\nfrom A.D. 610 to 641. The first independent treatise on the\r\ndisease was by the famous Arabian physician, Rhazes, who wrote\r\nin Syriac in 920 A.D., but his book has been translated into\r\nboth Greek and Latin. The first allusion to smallpox in English\r\nis in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript of the early part of the tenth\r\ncentury; the passage is interesting--\"Against pockes: very much\r\nshall one let blood and drink a bowl full of melted butter; if\r\nthey [pustules] strike out, one should dig each with a thorn\r\nand then drop one-year alder drink in, then they will not be\r\nseen,\" this was evidently to prevent the pitting dreaded even\r\nat so early a date. Smallpox was first described in Germany in\r\n1493, and appeared in Sweden first in 1578.\r\n\r\n[2] Osler thinks the pesta magna of Galen was smallpox; Marcus\r\nAurelius died of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contributions of Sydenham, the English Hippocrates, to the\r\nknowledge of smallpox, are classical.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Middle Ages, owing to the very crowded and\r\nunsanitary state of the cities of Europe, smallpox was one of\r\nthe various plagues from which the inhabitants were never free\r\nfor any length of time.[3] Leprosy, influenza, smallpox,\r\ncholera, typhus fever and bubonic plague constituted the\r\ndreadful group. In most countries, including England, smallpox\r\nwas practically endemic; an attack of it was accepted as a\r\nthing inevitable, in children even more inevitable than\r\nwhooping-cough, measles, mumps or chickenpox is regarded at the\r\npresent time. There was a common saying--\"Few escape love or\r\nsmallpox.\" In the eighteenth century so many faces were pitted\r\nfrom severe smallpox that it is said any woman who had no\r\nsmallpox marks was straightway accounted beautiful. Very few\r\npersons escaped it in either the mild or the severe form in\r\nchildhood or in later life.\r\n\r\n[3] England was by no means exempt, but it was not infection in\r\nthe modern sense that Shakespeare meant when he wrote--\r\n                       \"This England,\r\n      This fortress, built by Nature for herself\r\n      Against infection and the hand of war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it is characteristic of a microorganic disease that a\r\nperson who has recovered from an attack of it is immune from\r\nthat disease for a longer or shorter time, in some cases for\r\nthe remainder of life. This is, luckily, as true of smallpox as\r\nof any of the other acute infections. We do not now need to\r\nenquire into the theory of how this comes about; it is a\r\nwell-recognized natural phenomenon. The modern explanation is\r\nin terms of antigens and anti-bodies and is fast passing from\r\nthe stage of pure biochemical hypothesis into that of concrete\r\nrealization. Persons who have recovered from smallpox rarely\r\ntake it a second time; the few who do, have it in a mild form.\r\nIt follows, then, that if smallpox is purposely inoculated into\r\na human being he will for a long time be resistant to the\r\nsubsequent infection of smallpox. The fact of smallpox\r\nprotecting from smallpox is by no means without analogy in\r\nother diseases. Thus in Switzerland, in Africa, in Senegambia,\r\nit has been the custom for a long time, in order to protect the\r\ncattle from pleuro-pneumonia, to inoculate them with the fluid\r\nfrom the lung of an animal recently dead of pleuro-pneumonia.\r\nOf course since the time of Pasteur we have been quite familiar\r\nwith the inoculation of attenuated virus to protect from the\r\nnatural diseases in their fully virulent form, for instance,\r\nanthrax, rabies, plague and typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nAs it was, then, known to mankind from a very early period that\r\na person could be protected from smallpox by being inoculated\r\nwith it, inoculation grew up as a practice in widely distant\r\nparts of the globe. The purpose of intentional inoculation was\r\nto go through a mild attack of the disease in order to acquire\r\nprotection from the much more serious natural form of the\r\ndisease--to have had it so as not to have it. A very high\r\nantiquity is claimed for this smallpox inoculation, some even\r\nasserting that the earliest known Hindu physician (Dhanwantari)\r\nsupposed to have lived about 1500 B.C., was the first to\r\npractice it. Bruce in his \"Voyages to the Sources of the Nile\"\r\n(1790) tells us that he found Nubian and Arabian women\r\ninoculating their children against smallpox, and that the\r\ncustom had been observed from time immemorial. Records of it\r\nindeed are found all over the world; in Ashantee, amongst the\r\nArabs of North Africa, in Tripoli, Tunis and Algeria, in\r\nSenegal, in China, in Persia, in Thibet, in Bengal, in Siam, in\r\nTartary and in Turkey. In Siam the method of inoculation is\r\nvery curious; material from a dried pustule is blown up into\r\nthe nostrils; but in most other parts of the world the\r\ninoculation is by the ordinary method of superficial incision\r\nor what is called scarification. By the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century inoculation for smallpox was an established\r\npractise in several European countries into which it had\r\ntraveled by the coasts of the Bosphorus, via Constantinople. In\r\n1701 a medical man, Timoni, described the process as he saw it\r\nin Constantinople. Material was taken from the pustules of a\r\ncase on the twelfth or thirteenth day of the illness. As early\r\nas 1673 the practice was a common one in Denmark, Bartholinus\r\ntells us. In France inoculation had been widely practiced; on\r\nJune 18, 1774, the young king Louis XVI., was inoculated for\r\nsmallpox, and the fashionable ladies of the day wore in their\r\nhair a miniature rising sun and olive tree entwined by a\r\nserpent supporting a club, the \"pouf a l'inoculation\" of\r\nMademoiselle Rose Bertin, the court milliner to Marie\r\nAntoinette. In Germany inoculation was in vogue all through the\r\nseventeenth century, as also in Holland, Switzerland, Italy and\r\nCircassia. In England the well-known Dr. Mead, honored, by the\r\nway, with a grave in Westminster Abbey, was a firm believer in\r\ninoculation, as was also Dr. Dimsdale, who was sent for by the\r\nEmpress Catherine II. to introduce it into Russia. Dr. Dimsdale\r\ninoculated a number of persons in Petrograd, and finally the\r\nGrand Duke and the Empress herself. The lymph he took from the\r\narm of a child ill of natural smallpox. For his services to the\r\nRussian court Dr. Dimsdale was made a Baron of the Russian\r\nEmpire, a councillor of state and physician to the Empress. He\r\nwas presented with the sum of 1,000 pounds and voted an annuity\r\nof 500 pounds a year. At the request of Catherine, Dr. Dimsdale\r\nwent to Moscow, where thousands were clamoring for inoculation.\r\nThe mortality from smallpox in Russia seems to have been still\r\nhigher than in the rest of Europe. The annual average death\r\nrate on the Continent at the end of the eighteenth century was\r\n210 per 1,000 deaths from all causes, while in Russia in one\r\nyear two million persons perished from smallpox alone. In\r\nEngland in 1796, the deaths from smallpox were 18.6 per cent.\r\nof deaths from all causes.\r\n\r\nA great impetus was given to inoculation in England by the\r\nletters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague, the wife of our\r\nambassador to Turkey, Edward Wortley Montague, and daughter of\r\nthe Duke of Kingston. In 1717 Lady Mary wrote a letter to her\r\nfriend Miss Chiswell, in which she explained the process and\r\npromised to introduce it to the notice of the English\r\nphysicians. So convinced was Lady Mary of the safety of\r\nsmallpox inoculation and its efficacy in preserving from\r\nsubsequent smallpox, that in March, 1717, she had her little\r\nboy inoculated at the English embassy by an old Greek woman in\r\nthe presence of Dr. Maitland, surgeon to the embassy. In 1722\r\nsome criminals under sentence of death in Newgate were offered\r\na full pardon if they would undergo inoculation. Six men agreed\r\nto this, and none of them suffered at all severely from the\r\ninoculated smallpox. Towards the close of the same year two\r\nchildren of the Princess of Wales were successfully inoculated;\r\nand in 1746 an Inoculation Hospital was actually opened in\r\nLondon, but not without much opposition. As early as 1721 the\r\nRev. Cotton Mather, of Boston (U. S. A.), introduced\r\ninoculation to the notice of the American physicians, and in\r\n1722 Dr. Boylston, of Brooklyn, inoculated 247 persons, of whom\r\nabout 2 per cent. died of the acquired smallpox as compared\r\nwith 14 per cent. of deaths amongst 6,000 uninoculated persons\r\nwho caught the natural smallpox. There was, however, great\r\npopular opposition to the practice of inoculation, and Dr.\r\nBoylston on one occasion was nearly lynched.\r\n\r\nWhile successful inoculation undoubtedly protected the person\r\nfrom smallpox, sometimes the inoculated form of the disease was\r\nvirulent, and certainly all cases of inoculated variola were as\r\ninfectious as the natural variety. Inoculated persons were\r\ntherefore a danger to the community; and there is no doubt that\r\nsuch persons had occasionally introduced smallpox into towns\r\nwhich had been free from the natural disease. At the end of the\r\neighteenth century, just about the time of Jenner's discovery,\r\npublic opinion was strongly against the continuance of the\r\npractice of inoculation, and as natural smallpox had not at all\r\nabated its epidemic character, the times were ripe for \"some\r\nnew thing.\"\r\n\r\nNow there is a disease of cows know as cowpox or vaccinia (from\r\nthe Latin vacca, a cow) which is communicable to human beings.\r\nIt is thought to be due to the same virus which in pigs is\r\ncalled swinepox and in horses \"grease.\" Jenner believed\r\nvaccinia to be the same pathological entity as human smallpox,\r\nmodified, however, by its transmission through the cow. For a\r\nlong time this view was stoutly resisted, but it has now been\r\naccepted as probably representing the truth. The identity of\r\nvaccinia and \"grease\" is certainly much more doubtful.\r\n\r\nTo many of Jenner's contemporaries the view that vaccinia had\r\nat one time been a disease of human beings seemed unlikely; but\r\nwe are now in a far better position to admit its probability\r\nthan were those of Jenner's time. We have since then learned\r\nthat man shares many diseases with the lower animals,\r\ntuberculosis, plague, rabies, diphtheria and pleuro-pneumonia,\r\nto mention only a few. We have also learned that certain lower\r\nanimals, insects for instance, are intermediary hosts in the\r\nlife-cycle of many minute parasites which cause serious\r\ndiseases in the human being, amongst which malaria, yellow\r\nfever and the sleeping sickness are the most familiar.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been understood before Jenner's time that\r\npersons who had acquired cowpox by handling cattle, but\r\nespecially by milking cows, were immune from smallpox. In the\r\nreign of Charles II. it is well known that the court beauties\r\nenvied the dairy-maids because having had cowpox, they could\r\nnot take smallpox which all women so dreaded. Dr. Corlett tells\r\nus that the Duchess of Cleveland, one of the King's mistresses,\r\non being told that she might lose her place in the royal favor\r\nif she were disfigured by smallpox, replied that she had\r\nnothing to fear as she had had cowpox. In 1769 a German, Bose,\r\nwrote on the subject of cowpox protecting from smallpox. In the\r\nyear 1774 a cattle dealer, Benjamin Jesty, at Yetminster, in\r\nDorset, inoculated his wife and three children with cowpox.\r\nNone of them ever took smallpox during the rest of their lives\r\nalthough frequently exposed to its infection. Jesty died in\r\n1816, and it is recorded on his tombstone that he was the first\r\nperson who inoculated cowpox to protect from smallpox. Cowpox,\r\nor vaccinia, though infectious for cows, is not transmissible\r\namong human beings, in other words, as a disease of man it is\r\nnot infectious. Edward Jenner, the Englishman of Berkeley in\r\nGloucestershire, was the first person to think scientifically\r\non the fact that cowpox protected from smallpox. John Hunter\r\nhad said to him, \"Jenner, don't think, try.\" Luckily, however,\r\nhe did both. Thinking alone avails little, experimentation\r\nalone avails not much, but the one along with the other has\r\nremoved mountains. Just as Newton thought scientifically about\r\nthat falling apple and reduced our conceptions of the universe\r\nto order, just as Watt thought scientifically about that\r\nkettle-lid lifted by the steam and so introduced the modern era\r\nof mechanical power brought under man's control, so Jenner\r\nthought about and experimented with cowpox until he had\r\nsatisfied himself that he had discovered something which would\r\nrid the human race forever of the incubus of an intolerable\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1780 that Jenner set himself to study cowpox in a way\r\nthat had never before been attempted, for he was convinced that\r\nin the having had an attack of the disease lay the secret of\r\nthe conquest of that world-scourge. He confided in his fried\r\nEdward Gardner about \"a most important matter . . . which I\r\nfirmly believe will prove of essential benefit to the human\r\nrace . . . should anything untoward turn up in my experiments,\r\nI should be made, particularly by my medical brethren, the\r\nsubject of ridicule.\" Luckily he was quite prepared for both\r\nridicule and opposition; for has not everything new been\r\nridiculed and opposed? Galileo was opposed, Bruno was opposed,\r\nCopernicus was opposed, Harvey was opposed, George Stevenson\r\nwas opposed, Pasteur was ridiculed and opposed, and so were\r\nDarwin, Simpson and even Lister. The physiological inertia even\r\nof the educated has too often blocked the path of advancement:\r\nbut Jenner is in illustrious company, a prince amongst the\r\nhierarchy of the misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe facts or surmises before Jenner at this date, then,\r\nwere--(a) Cowpox produces an eruption extremely like that of\r\nmild smallpox, it is, therefore, probably a form of smallpox\r\nmodified by transmission through the cow; (b) And an attack of\r\ncowpox protects from smallpox. To test these things\r\nexperimentally some one must first be inoculated with cowpox,\r\nand, having recovered from the vaccinia, that same person must,\r\nsecondly, be inoculated with the virus of smallpox or be\r\nexposed to the infection, and, thirdly, this person ought not\r\nto take the disease.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 Jenner had a careful drawing made of the hand of a\r\nmilkmaid suffering from cowpox to demonstrate to Sir Everard\r\nHome how exceedingly similar were vaccinia and variola. Home\r\nagreed it was \"interesting and curious,\" and the subject began\r\nto attract some attention in medical circles.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1789, Dr. Jenner inoculated his eldest child\r\nEdward, aged 18 months, with some swinepox virus, and as\r\nnothing untoward happened, he inoculated him again with\r\nswinepox on April 7, 1791. The child had a slight illness, very\r\nlike vaccinia, from which he rapidly recovered. The moment for\r\nthe crucial experiment was not yet; it came in due time, but\r\nJenner had to wait five years for it, and five years are a long\r\ntime to a man who is yearning to perform his crucial\r\nexperiment. Happily for suffering humanity, in the early summer\r\nof 1796 the opportunity came; the hour and the man were there\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nCowpox had broken out on a farm near Berkeley and a dairy maid\r\ncalled Sarah Neames contracted the disease. On May 14, 1796,\r\nDr. Jenner took some fluid from a sore on this woman's hand and\r\ninoculated it by slight scratching into the arm of a healthy\r\nboy eight years old, by name James Phipps. The boy had the\r\nusual \"reaction\" or attack of vaccinia, a disorder\r\nindistinguishable from the mildest form of smallpox. After an\r\ninterval of six weeks, on July 1, Jenner made the most\r\nmomentous but justifiable experiment, for he inoculated James\r\nPhipps with smallpox by lymph taken from a sore on a case of\r\ngenuine, well-marked, human smallpox, AND THE BOY DID NOT TAKE\r\nTHE DISEASE AT ALL. Jenner waited till the nineteenth of the\r\nmonth, and finding that the boy had still not developed\r\nvariola, he could hardly write for joy. \"Listen,\" he wrote to\r\nGardner, \"to the most delightful part of my story. The boy has\r\nsince been inoculated for the smallpox which, aS I VERNTURED TO\r\nPREDICT, produced no effect. I shall now pursue my experiments\r\nwith redoubled ardor.\"\r\n\r\nHere we are behind the scenes at a great discovery; \"as I\r\nventured to predict\"; prediction is part of scientific\r\ntheorizing; there is a place for legitimate prediction as there\r\nis for experimentation. All discoverers have made predictions;\r\nHarvey predicted the existence of the capillaries, Halley\r\npredicted the return of his comet, Adams predicted the place of\r\nthe planet Neptune, the missing link in the evolutionary series\r\nof the fossil horses had been predicted long before it was\r\nactually found by Professor Marsh. Pasteur predicted that the\r\nsheep inoculated with the weak anthrax virus would be alive in\r\nthe anthrax-infected field, while those not so protected would\r\nall be dead. A prediction verified is a conclusion\r\ncorroborated, an investigator encouraged.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1797, through another outbreak of cowpox, Jenner was\r\nable to inoculate three persons with variola, only to find as\r\nbefore that they were immune from smallpox. He now felt himself\r\njustified in preparing a paper for the Royal Society, the\r\nhighest scientific tribunal in England. The council, however,\r\nreturned him his paper with the remark that in their opinion\r\nthe amount of evidence was not strong enough to warrant its\r\npublication in the Transactions. Jenner was wise enough not to\r\nbe discouraged, and so in June, 1798, he published the paper\r\nhimself under the title, \"Inquiry into the causes and effects\r\nof the Variolae-Vacciniae, a disease discovered in some of the\r\nwestern counties of England, particularly Gloucestershire, and\r\nknown by the name of cowpox.\" This historic pamphlet, which\r\nranks with the great classics of medicine, was dedicated to Dr.\r\nO. H. Parry, of Bath. Later on the Royal Society was sagacious\r\nenough to elect the very man whose paper it had previously\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nWhile in London attending to the publication of his pamphlet,\r\nDr. Jenner called on the great surgeon Mr. Cline, and left some\r\ncowpox virus with him for trial. Cline inoculated a young\r\ntubercular patient with vaccinia and later with smallpox in no\r\nless than three places. In due time this patient did not show a\r\nsign of smallpox. So impressed was Cline with this remarkable\r\nresult that he wrote to Jenner thus: \"I think the substitution\r\nof cowpox poison for smallpox one of the greatest improvements\r\nthat has ever been made in medicine. The more I think on the\r\nsubject, the more I am impressed with its importance.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"vaccination\" was coined by the French, so remarkable\r\nfor the aptness of their descriptive terms, and it has ever\r\nsince remained with us as a convenient expression for the\r\ninoculation of vaccinia as protecting from variola.[4]\r\n\r\n[4] It is certainly not necessary to point out that the\r\nprinciple of vaccination has been one of wide application in\r\nmodern medicine. Our word \"vaccine\" testifies to this. A\r\nvaccine is a liquid, the result of bacterial growth, injected\r\ninto a patient in order to render him immune from that\r\nparticular disease which is caused by sufficient infection with\r\nthe microorganisms in question, e. g., of typhoid fever or of\r\nplague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Jenner's views were now becoming known, and the critics and\r\nthe doubters had appeared: St. Thomas has always had a large\r\nfollowing. The most formidable of the early objectors was Dr.\r\nIgenhouz, who had come to London to study inoculation for\r\nvariola, and had already inoculated, among other notable\r\npersons, the Archduchess Theresa Elizabeth of Vienna. The\r\ncareless vaccinations of Doctors Pearson and Woodville at the\r\nLondon Smallpox Hospital brought much apparent discredit on\r\nJenner's work. In all his early work Jenner used lymph obtained\r\ndirectly from papules on the cow or calf, but Woodville in 1799\r\nshowed that excellent results could be got from arm-to-arm\r\nvaccination. As this latter method is a very convenient one,\r\nthe technique was widely adopted. We have to remember that we\r\nare speaking of a period about sixty years before Lister gave\r\nto suffering humanity that other great gift, antisepsis: and so\r\nmany arms \"went wrong,\" not because of being vaccinated, but\r\nbecause the scratches were afterwards infected by the\r\nmicroorganisms of dirt. Jenner knew well the difference between\r\nthe reaction of clean vaccination and that of an infected arm,\r\nbut a great many medical men of his time did not, and so he was\r\nconstantly plagued with reports of vaccinations \"going wrong\"\r\nwhen it was septic infection of uncleansed skin that had\r\noccurred. The explanation of these things by letter consumed a\r\nvery great deal of his valuable time. By the end of 1799 a\r\nlarge number of persons had, however, been successfully\r\nvaccinated. As one Pearson proved troublesome by starting an\r\ninstitution for public vaccination on principles which Jenner\r\nknew to be wrong, and as Jenner found himself virtually\r\nsupplanted and misrepresented, he came up to London in 1800 to\r\nvindicate his position. The King, the Queen and the Prince of\r\nWales, to whom he was presented, materially helped on the cause\r\nby countenancing the practice of vaccination. Lord Berkeley,\r\nhis Lord of the Manor, was in this as in all things a kind and\r\nwise patron. In the United States of America vaccination made\r\nrapid progress, having been introduced there under the good\r\nauspices of Dr. Waterhouse, professor of medicine at Cambridge,\r\nMass. The discovery was announced with true American\r\ninformality as \"Something curious in the medical line,\" on\r\nMarch 12, 1799.\r\n\r\nThings went even better on the continent of Europe; deCarro, of\r\nVienna, inaugurated vaccination with such zeal and\r\ndiscrimination that it spread to Switzerland, France, Italy and\r\nSpain. From Spain it passed over to Latin America. In Sicily\r\nand Naples, \"the blessed vaccine\" was received by religious\r\nprocessions. Sacco, of Milan, commenced vaccinating in 1801,\r\nand in a few years had vaccinated 20,000. In Paris, a Vaccine\r\nInstitute was established; and Napoleon ordered all his\r\nsoldiers who had not had smallpox to be vaccinated. On Jenner's\r\napplication, the Emperor liberated several English prisoners\r\nremarking--\"What that man asks is not to be refused.\" Napoleon\r\nvoted 100,000 francs for the propagation of vaccination. Lord\r\nElgin introduced it into Turkey and Greece. The Empress of\r\nRussia, Catherine II., was one of the greatest supporters of\r\nJennerian vaccination. She decreed that the first child\r\nvaccinated in Russia should be called \"Vaccinoff,\" should be\r\nconveyed to Petrograd in an imperial coach, educated at the\r\nexpense of the state and receive a pension for life. The\r\nEmperor of Austria and the King of Spain released English\r\nprisoners at Jenner's request. There were statues of Jenner\r\nerected abroad, at Boulogne and at Brunn, in Moravia, before\r\nany in England. Thus the European countries showed their\r\ngratitude to the Englishman whose patience, genius and absence\r\nof self-seeking had rid them of the detestable world-plague of\r\nsmallpox. Vaccination was made compulsory by law in no less\r\nthan five European countries before it was so in the United\r\nKingdom in 1853. In eight countries vaccination is provided\r\nfree at the expense of the government. The clergy of Geneva and\r\nof Holland from their pulpits recommended their people to be\r\nvaccinated. In Germany, Jenner's birthday (May 17) was\r\ncelebrated as a holiday. Within six years, Jenner's gift to\r\nhumanity had been accepted with that readiness with which the\r\ndrowning clutch at straws. The most diverse climes, races,\r\ntongues and religions were united in blessing vaccination and\r\nits discoverer. The North American Indians forwarded to Dr.\r\nJenner a quaintly worded address full of the deepest gratitude\r\nfor what he had saved them from: \"We shall not fail,\" said\r\nthese simple people, \"to teach our children to speak the name\r\nof Jenner, and to thank the Great Spirit for bestowing upon him\r\nso much wisdom and so much benevolence.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two allusions to smallpox in \"Don Juan,\" which was\r\npublished in 1819, showing to what an extent Jennerian\r\nteachings were in the air. The first is:\r\n\r\n The doctor paid off an old pox\r\n  By borrowing a new one from an ox.\r\n                   (Canto I., stanza 129.)\r\n\r\nThe second is:\r\n\r\n I said the smallpox has gone out of late,\r\n  Perhaps it may be followed by the great.\r\n(Stanza 130.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore 1812, Jenner had been made an honorary member of nearly\r\nevery scientific society in Europe, and had received the\r\nfreedom of the cities of London, Edinburgh, Dublin and Glasgow.\r\nThe Medical Society of London presented him with a gold medal\r\nstruck in his honor; in Berlin in 1812 there was a Jennerian\r\nfestival on the anniversary of Phipps's vaccination. Addresses\r\nand diplomas were showered on him, and in 1813 the University\r\nof Oxford conferred on him the degree of M.D. honoris causa. As\r\nhe refused point blank to pass the examination in Latin and\r\nGreek required by the Royal College of Physicians of London,\r\nJenner never obtained admission into that learned body. When\r\nsome one recommended him to revise his classics so that he\r\nmight become an F.R.C.P. he replied, \"I would not do it for a\r\ndiadem\"; and then, thinking of a far better reward, added: \"I\r\nwould not do it for John Hunter's museum.\"\r\n\r\nBut while the pure in heart were thus receiving the blessing\r\noffered them by the benovelent man of science, the pests of\r\nsociety, those discontented and jaundiced ones who are always\r\nto be found in the dark recesses of the cave of Adullam, were\r\nnot idle. Many of his medical colleagues did indeed sneer, as\r\nsome are always apt to do at any new thing however good. To all\r\nthese Jenner replied, and a very great deal of his valuable\r\ntime was consumed in arguing with them. But the sect of the\r\nanti-vaccinators had arisen, and was to some extent organized.\r\nCaricatures, lampoons, scurrilities, vulgarities and\r\nmisrepresentations, the mean, were scattered on all sides.\r\nNothing was too absurd to be stated or believed--that\r\nvaccinated persons had their faces grow like oxen, that they\r\ncoughed like cows, bellowed like bulls and became hairy on the\r\nbody. One omniscient objector declared that, \"vaccination was\r\nthe most degrading relapse of philosophy that had ever\r\ndisgraced the civilized world.\" A Dr. Rowley, evidently\r\nimagining himself honored by a special participation in the\r\nDivine counsels, declared that \"smallpox is a visitation from\r\nGod, but cowpox is produced by presumptuous man. The former was\r\nwhat Heaven had ordained, the latter is a daring violation of\r\nour holy religion.\" It was rather hard to blame Dr. Jenner for\r\nthe origin of cowpox. It took much forbearance to endure this\r\nsort of thing; but Jenner's was a first-class mind and he\r\nevidently dealt leniently even with fools. It was not for the\r\nfirst time in the world's history that a lover of mankind had\r\nbeen spurned with the words--\"He hath a devil and is mad.\"\r\n\r\nBesides enduring all these mental and physical worries, and the\r\nannoyance that the Royal Jennerian Society established in 1802\r\nwas so mismanaged that it collapsed in 1808, Jenner had spent a\r\nvery large sum of private money on the introduction of\r\nvaccination. He had been, as he himself expressed it, \"Vaccine\r\nclerk to the whole world.\" Parliament, it is true, in 1801,\r\nvoted him a sum of 10,000 pounds which was not paid for three\r\nyears afterwards and was diminished by 1,000 pounds deducted\r\nfor fees, so that it barely recompensed him for his outlays. By\r\n1806, the immensity of the benefit conferred upon his diseased\r\nfellow-creatures having been recognized more perfectly in every\r\nother country than his own, the British Parliament woke up, and\r\nvoted him a sum of 20,000 pounds, only one member representing\r\nthe anti-vaccinators opposing the grant. Parliament, which had\r\npreviously received from the Colleges of Physicians of London,\r\nEdinburgh and Dublin the most favorable reports of the efficacy\r\nof vaccination, decided to reestablish the Royal Jennerian\r\nInstitute. A subscription of 7,383 pounds from grateful India\r\nreached Jenner in 1812. In 1814 he was in London for the last\r\ntime, when he was presented to the Emperor of Russia, Alexander\r\nI., who told him that he had very nearly subdued smallpox\r\nthroughout that vast Empire. Jenner refused a Russian order on\r\nthe ground that he was not a man of independent means.\r\n\r\nThe management of the Institute caused him much concern in his\r\nlater years; he disapproved of the personnel and of many of the\r\ndetails of its working. One of the last worries of his life was\r\nan article in the November number for 1822 of the famous\r\nEdinburgh Review. Although it contained a good deal of praise,\r\nit was not favorable to Jenner, who said of it, \"I put it down\r\nat 100,000 deaths at least.\" I have ascertained that this\r\narticle was not written by the celebrated Francis Jeffrey,\r\nalthough he was editor of the Review until 1829.\r\n\r\nJenner's life, apart from his great discovery and his\r\ndeveloping the practice of vaccination, has not much incident\r\nin it. He was born on May 17, 1749, the son of the Rev. Stephen\r\nJenner, vicar of Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England, the same\r\nBerkeley in whose castle, Edward II., the vanquished at\r\nBanockburn, was murdered in 1327. Jenner's mother's name was\r\nHead. Edward went to school at Wotton-under-Edge and at\r\nCirencester, and began to study medicine with a Mr. Ludlow, a\r\nsurgeon at Sodbury near Bristol. In his twenty-first year,\r\nJenner went to London as a pupil of the great John Hunter, in\r\nwhose house, he lived two years, during which time he was\r\nentered as a medical student at St. George's Hospital. It is\r\ninteresting to know that while still a student he was asked by\r\nSir Joseph Banks to arrange and catalogue the zoological\r\nspecimens brought home by the circumnavigator Captain Cook in\r\nhis first voyage of 1771. Jenner devoted considerable attention\r\nto natural history, to geology and to the study of fossils, on\r\nwhich topics he kept up correspondence with Hunter long after\r\nhe left London. In the year 1788 he married a Miss Kingscote,\r\nand settled down to practice in his native place. Mrs. Jenner\r\ndied in 1815, after which date Jenner never left Berkeley\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, it was not until 1792 that Jenner obtained\r\nthe degree of M.D., and it was not from an English university\r\nat all, but from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\r\nThis university, the smallest although the oldest of the\r\nScottish universities, has therefore the honor of being the\r\nAlma Mater to the epoch-making Englishman. I have seen the\r\nentry of the name in the list of graduates for the year 1792;\r\nit has evidently been misspelled, for the name is corrected.\r\nThe first foreign university to recognize Jenner's eminence was\r\nGottingen. In 1794 Jenner had an attack of typhus fever. Jenner\r\nnever cared for London or a city life, and although in 1808 he\r\nwas persuaded to take a house in town, he soon gave it up and\r\nwent back to his beautiful Gloucestershire. For many years he\r\npracticed during the season in the pleasant health-resort of\r\nCheltenham. He loved the country, he studied lovingly the\r\nliving things around him there: many are familiar with a piece\r\nof verse he wrote on \"The signs of rain.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1810 was a sad one for Jenner: his eldest son died,\r\nand that noticeably depressed his health. In 1823 he presented\r\na paper to the Royal Society on the migration of birds, a\r\nsubject not even yet fully cleared up. On January 26, in the\r\nsame year, he was stricken with paralysis on the right side and\r\ndied within twenty-four hours. His body was buried in the\r\nchancel of the parish church of Berkeley, where there is a\r\nmemorial window placed by public subscription. In person,\r\nEdward Jenner was short and rather heavily built; his\r\nexpression of face was pleasant with a touch of sadness. All\r\nreports agree that in dress he was conspicuously neat, looking\r\nmore like a gentleman-farmer than a physician, with his blue\r\ncoat, yellow buttons, red waistcoat, buff breeches and\r\ntop-boots.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] He was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, by Northcote and by\r\nVigneron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no disguising the fact that during his lifetime Dr.\r\nJenner was much more appreciated in foreign countries than in\r\nEngland. The medico-social club of Alverton, near where he\r\nlived, would not listen to him when he addressed them on\r\nvaccination. The effort to collect enough money from the\r\nmedical men of England in order to place a marble statue to\r\nJenner in the nave of Gloucester Cathedral, was successful only\r\nafter a long delay. An attempt to erect a statue in London died\r\nof apathy; but in 1858, 32 years after he died, a statue was\r\nerected in Trafalgar Square. In 1862 it was removed to a quiet\r\ncorner of Kensington gardens; and perhaps its surroundings, the\r\ntrees, the flowers and the birds he loved are more suitable\r\nthan the effigies of those national heroes who served their\r\ncountry by taking, not by saving life. No, Nelson the hero is\r\nhardly the suitable companion for Jenner the hero.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Jenner's medical contemporaries, at\r\nleast in England, failed to appreciate the magnitude of the\r\ngift their colleague had presented not merely to his own\r\ncountry, but to the world at large. The discovery had, of\r\ncourse, been led up to by several different lines of\r\nindication, but this in no way detracts from the genius of\r\nJenner in drawing his memorable inductions from the few facts\r\nwhich others had known before his time. The fame of Newton is\r\nno whit diminished because Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo lived\r\nand worked before him, the credit due to Harvey is none the\r\nless because many before his time had worked on the problem of\r\nthe heart and vessels, and because some of them, notably\r\nCesalpinus, came within a very little of the discovery of the\r\ncirculation; the achievements of Darwin are not to be belittled\r\nbecause Lamarck, Malthus or Monboddo had notions in accordance\r\nwith the tenor of his great generalization of evolution among\r\nliving beings. Certainly Jenner had precursors; but it was his\r\ngenius and his genius alone which, putting together the various\r\nfragments of knowledge already possessed, gave us the grand but\r\nsimple induction based on his own experiments that vaccinia\r\nprevents from variola. It was too simple and too new to be\r\nappreciated in all its bearings either by the medical men or\r\nthe laity of his own day. Its impressiveness is not inherent in\r\nit, as it is in the mathematical demonstration of universal\r\ngravitation, as it is in the atomic theory or in that of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest through natural selection. The English\r\ncountry doctor merely said in essence--\"let me give you cowpox\r\nand you will not get smallpox.\" Unless the fact of this\r\nimmunity is regarded as possessed by all the nations of the\r\nworld for ever more there is nothing particularly impressive in\r\nit; and so it failed to impress his contemporaries. It is only\r\nwhen we contrast the loathsomeness and danger of smallpox with\r\nthe mildness and safety of vaccinia and varioloid that we grasp\r\nthe greatness of the work which Jenner did for mankind. The\r\nvery simplicity of vaccination detracts from its impressiveness\r\nunless its results are viewed through the vista of the\r\ncenturies. We need the proper historical perspective in this as\r\nin all else. Thus viewed, however, the simplicity of the\r\nprocedure and the universality of its application are most\r\nimposing. Vaccination does not, indeed, dazzle the scientific\r\nimagination like some of the other generalizations of biology,\r\nbut it is one that has been gloriously vindicated by the\r\nsubsequent history of the world's hygiene.\r\n\r\nJenner knew himself to be a benefactor of the human race; he\r\nwould have been insincere if he had pretended otherwise; he\r\nfinished his first paper with these words: \"I shall endeavor\r\nstill farther to prosecute this enquiry, an enquiry, I trust,\r\nnot merely speculative, but of sufficient moment to inspire the\r\npleasing hope of its becoming essentially useful to mankind\";\r\nand on his death-bed he said, \"I do not marvel that men are not\r\ngrateful to me, but I am surprised that they do not feel\r\ngrateful to God for making me a medium of good.\"\r\n\r\nIn private life Dr. Jenner was amiable and kind-hearted. Dibden\r\nsaid of him: \"I never knew a man of simpler mind or of warmer\r\nheart.\" He was particularly kind to the poor. Dr. Matthew\r\nBaillie said of him: \"Jenner might have been immensely rich if\r\nhe had not published his discovery.\"\r\n\r\nWe may in conclusion examine some of the objections to and\r\ncriticisms of vaccination. The objections can be classified as\r\nthose entertained (a) by medical men and (b) those by the\r\npublic generally.\r\n\r\nThe objections raised by medical men are now a matter of\r\nancient history. Each generation of medical men has refused at\r\nfirst to admit any new teaching promulgated in its time;\r\nphysiological inertia is not at once overcome. The most\r\nenlightened of Jenner's critics did really believe that he was\r\ndrawing too extensive an induction from insufficient data; this\r\nwas the position of the Royal Society in 1788; but the\r\nEdinburgh reviewer of 1822 should have known better. The purely\r\ntechnical criticisms of Jenner's work have by this time been\r\nfully assessed and replied to. It is true that at one time it\r\nwas not clear what were the relationships of chickenpox and\r\nsmallpox, of vaccinia and variola, of vaccinia and varioloid,\r\nof the various forms of pox in animals--cowpox, swinepox,\r\nhorsepox or grease--either inter se or to human smallpox. But I\r\ndo not suppose that in this year of grace 1914 there can be\r\nfound one properly trained medical man, acquainted with the\r\nhistory of Jennerian vaccination, familiar with the ravages of\r\nsmallpox and with the protective power of vaccinia, who could\r\nbe induced, by no matter how large a bribe, to say that he\r\ndisapproved of vaccination or that he believed it did not\r\nprotect from smallpox. There are cranks in all walks of life,\r\nbut the medical crank who is also an anti-vaccinationist is\r\nhappily the rarest of them all.\r\n\r\nThe lay objectors--the professed anti-vaccinators--are with us\r\nyet in spite of some very serious lessons which have been\r\ntaught them. We may pass by the objectors of the class who\r\nbelieve that vaccinated persons cough like cows and bellow like\r\nbulls; these objections go into the limbo of old wives' fables\r\nor into the category of wilful misrepresentation. Unfortunately\r\nthere is a large class of persons who can believe the absurdest\r\nnonsense about any subject which is particularly distasteful to\r\nthem.[6] Another class of objection is the sentimental\r\nrepugnance to the idea of being given one of the diseases of\r\n\"the lower animals.\" Now the fact is that already we share a\r\ngreat many diseases with the lower animals, a few of them being\r\ntuberculosis, anthrax, rabies, tetanus, cancer,\r\npleuro-pneumonia, certain insect-borne diseases, some parasitic\r\nworm diseases and some skin diseases like favus. As the\r\nknowledge of the lowly origin of many of our diseases is more\r\nwidespread, this sort of objection will die out.\r\n\r\n[6] Antivaccinators constantly allude to calf-lymph as \"filth\";\r\nif lymph is filth, then I am able to assure them that each one\r\nof them has about three liters of it in his own body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn objection which is worthy of more consideration is that in\r\nbeing vaccinated a child is apt to contract some infectious\r\ndisease such as tuberculosis or syphilis which are the two most\r\ndreaded. Now so long as arm-to-arm vaccination was the routine\r\npractice, there was a remote probability that this sort of\r\naccident might occur. It appears to be true that a few\r\naccidents of this kind have occurred, just as a few arms have\r\nbecome septic or had erysipelas develop in them. But when the\r\nfew such cases are compared with the millions and millions of\r\nuncomplicated vaccinations, their importance becomes very\r\ninsignificant. Now that arm-to-arm vaccination is no longer\r\npracticed, but fresh calf-lymph used for each child, these\r\naccidental inoculations are a thing of the past. The ignorance\r\nof cause and effect is responsible for a great deal of the most\r\nchildish objections to vaccination as to much else. One woman\r\nlately told me that she could not have her child vaccinated\r\nbecause a child in the same street was made a cripple for life\r\nby being vaccinated. Could we have a better example of the\r\n\"post hoc sed non propter hoc.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[7] Now and again, however, we have the sad spectacle of some\r\none really well educated but apparently either ignorant of\r\nlogic or desirous of wilfully misrepresenting facts. The Hon.\r\nStephen Coleridge has an article in the June (1914) number of\r\nthe Contemporary Review which is, to say the least of it,\r\nhighly immoral in ethics and statistics.\r\n\r\nI shall examine only that part of it bearing on vaccination.\r\nThe statements are that in the last five recorded years, 58\r\npersons died from smallpox vaccination (he means vaccination\r\nagainst smallpox), whereas in the same five years, 85 persons\r\ndied from smallpox itself. The inference we are intended to\r\ndraw from these figures is that to be vaccinated is nearly as\r\nfatal as to have smallpox itself.\r\n\r\nNow this kind of argument is a very common one with\r\nstatistically immoral persons, and is known as the suppression\r\nof the ratio. Before we can appreciate the fact that in five\r\nyears 58 persons died after being vaccinated, we at least need\r\nto know the total number of persons who were vaccinated. If\r\nonly 58 persons were vaccinated and they all died, then the\r\nmortality was 100 per cent., but if, as was practically the\r\ncase, thousands of infants in Great Britain were vaccinated in\r\nfive years, then if only 58 died after vaccination (although\r\nnot necessarily in consequence of it) the mortality falls some\r\nthousands of a per cent. The suppression of the ratio, i. e.,\r\n58/many thousands is the deceit that is practiced.\r\n\r\nFifty-eight per year for five years, is 11.6 deaths per year of\r\npersons vaccinated: presumably these were infants: taking the\r\nbirth-rate in England as 30 per 1,000 living, we may say that\r\n900,000 infants were born; deduct 100,000 as not vaccinated, we\r\nhave 800,000 infants vaccinated, of these 11.6 died after being\r\nvaccinated, which is 0.0014 per cent. This is not much of a\r\nmortality from any cause; but using Mr. Coleridge's own\r\nfigures, it is a splendid demonstration of the safety of\r\ninfant-vaccination, the opposite of what he pretends it shows.\r\n\r\nMr. Coleridge proceeds to tell us that in five years 85 persons\r\ndied of smallpox in Great Britain, i. e., an average of 17\r\npersons per year. In other words 17 persons died of smallpox in\r\na country with 30 million inhabitants, or 0.000056 per cent. of\r\npersons living, not a high mortality. And we strongly suspect,\r\nmay we hope, that those 17 were persons who had not been\r\nvaccinated.\r\n\r\nBut in Pre-Jennerian days, 17 persons died of smallpox out of\r\nevery 100 persons dying from all causes.\r\n\r\nMr. Coleridge's figures, properly and honestly interpreted,\r\ntestify loudly to conclusions exactly the opposite of what he\r\ndesires to insinuate; he has no doubt taken the statistics of\r\nthe Registrar-General, but he has prostituted them.\r\n\r\nMr. Coleridge's paper could not be a better example of the art\r\nof concealing the causes of phenomena.\r\n\r\nHe exhibits the following table:\r\n\r\nDeaths from smallpox per annum per a million living:\r\n\r\n1862-1870 ................................. 172.2\r\n1871-1880 ................................. 244.6\r\n1881-1890 .................................  45.8\r\n1891-1900 .................................  13.3\r\n1901-1910 .................................  12.8\r\n\r\nSo that the table shows that since 1880 in Great Britain the\r\ndeaths from smallpox per million per year have declined until\r\nthey are only about 1/14th of their original number.\r\n\r\nThe natural inference from these figures, viewed in the light\r\nof the history of smallpox in Great Britain, is that compulsory\r\nvaccination has been steadily eradicating the disease; but this\r\nis not Mr. Coleridge's conclusion: He says it is due to the\r\nlarge number of persons who have refused to be vaccinated! This\r\nwould be laughable if it were not really serious; it is sad and\r\nserious that a man of Mr. Coleridge's education and social\r\nposition should so consistently mislead the uncritical readers\r\nof the Contemporary Review to whose pages he has unfortunately\r\nvery free access. If Mr. Coleridge really believes these things\r\nhe is either very stupid or very ignorant; if he knows them to\r\nbe otherwise, but wilfully deceives the public, he is immoral.\r\nHe suffers from the worst form of bias, the anti-scientific.\r\n{the end of long footnote}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still that group of persons who object to\r\neverything--anti-vivisection, anti-meat eating, anti-breakfast,\r\nanti-hats and of course also anti-vaccination. They are anti\r\nthe usual and the normal that are quite good enough for the\r\nmost of people. They generally also believe that the earth is\r\nflat; they are past praying for, all we can do with them is to\r\nlook them, like the difficulty of Jonah and the whale, \"full in\r\nthe face and pass on.\"\r\n\r\nMany people at the present time allow themselves to be\r\npersuaded into being anti-vaccinators because neither they nor\r\ntheir deluders have ever known what an epidemic of smallpox is,\r\nhave never seen with their own eyes the awful spectacle of a\r\nperson suffering from smallpox in any of its forms--discrete,\r\nconfluent or hemorrhagic. Thanks to this very Jenner, the world\r\nhas now for 100 years been almost free from epidemic, virulent\r\nsmallpox and most perfectly so in the vaccinated countries, so\r\nthat millions, the majority, of Englishmen, have never seen a\r\ncase of smallpox at all. Not knowing the awful danger they have\r\nescaped, through Great Britain having had compulsory\r\nvaccination since 1853, they have become lax in their belief in\r\nthe necessity for the continuance of that precaution. \"They\r\njest at scars that never felt a wound.\" Towns such as\r\nGloucester in England, in which a large number of children have\r\nbeen allowed to grow up unvaccinated, have always been visited\r\nsooner or later by a serious outbreak of smallpox. It must be\r\nso; the laws of natural phenomena can not be changed to suit\r\nthe taste of those persons who are mentally incapable of\r\nunderstanding them. They can not be evaded; ignorance of the\r\nlaw is no more an excuse in the realm of natural than of\r\nman-made law.\r\n\r\nWe now come to that undesirable product of present-day,\r\ngrandmotherly legislation, the conscientious objector. As I am\r\nnot a politician, I shall not say anything for or against the\r\npolicy of inserting in a bill which makes vaccination\r\ncompulsory a clause giving to the conscientious objector the\r\npower or right to refuse to have his child vaccinated, but as a\r\nmedical man who knows a little of the history of medicine, I\r\ncan only describe it as gratuitous folly. I am one of those who\r\nbelieve that the laity should have no say in the matter of\r\nwhether any given procedure is or is not advantageous for the\r\npublic health. The efficacy of universal inoculation of\r\nvaccinia as a prophylactic against variola is a question of\r\nscientific medicine to be decided on technical grounds and\r\nought not to be a matter open to debate by the public at all.\r\nIt is perfectly monstrous to suppose that the ordinary person,\r\nquite untrained to weigh evidence for or against the\r\nadvisability of the carrying out of a particular form of\r\nnational immunization against a horrid disease, is qualified to\r\nform any opinion. He might as well be consulted on the\r\nadvisability of making the channel tunnel or on the safest type\r\nof aeroplane or on any other subject involving the technical\r\ntraining of the engineer. To permit the so-called \"man in the\r\nstreet\" to say whether he shall or shall not permit the\r\ncarrying out of some important piece of civic hygiene is to\r\nintroduce a principle subversive of all system and obstructive\r\nof all progress in the science of public health. It is absurd\r\nthat in a case like this the pronouncements of the judges are\r\nto be submitted to the criticisms of the jury. England has\r\nalready had one or two pretty severe lessons through allowing\r\nsuch places as Gloucester and Leicester to exercise their right\r\nof private judgment on the question of vaccination. In\r\nGloucester where there was at one time a vigorous\r\nanti-vaccination movement, a serious epidemic overtook the city\r\na few years ago (1896). What science pronounces to be\r\nbeneficial, the layman must submit to. What we want in these\r\ndays is less superstition and more faith--in science. I am\r\ninformed that there are more than 2,000 unvaccinated children\r\nin the schools of this city at the present moment, and all\r\nbecause a piece of legislation allows any unintelligent,\r\nprejudiced or credulous parent to decide on the momentous\r\nquestion of the vaccination of his children.\r\n\r\nOur quarantine regulations are extremely strict, and rightly\r\nso, on the subject of smallpox; but is it not a farce to take\r\nso much trouble about the health of our immigrants when inside\r\nthe city we are all the time encouraging a high degree of\r\nreceptivity towards this very disease? I should call this a\r\nvery clear case of straining at the international gnat and\r\nswallowing the municipal camel. The community at present is at\r\nthe mercy of its least instructed members. A most sensible\r\nsuggestion is that if an outbreak of smallpox occurs in\r\nHalifax, the cost of it should be borne by the unvaccinated and\r\nby the anti-vaccinators. The fact is we have forgotten what\r\nsmallpox is like. In 1796 before Jennerian vaccination, the\r\ndeath-rate from smallpox in England was 18.5 per cent. of\r\ndeaths from all causes; in London between 1838 and 1869 it was\r\n1.4 per cent., while in 1871--the worst year for smallpox since\r\nvaccination became compulsory--the deaths from smallpox were\r\nbarely 4.5 per cent. of deaths from all causes, a proportion\r\nwhich was exceeded 93 times in the eighteenth century. At the\r\npresent moment the deaths from smallpox in London constitute a\r\nlittle under 0.24 per cent. of deaths from all causes, or 77\r\ntimes less than in pre-Jennerian times.\r\n\r\nAccording to MacVail, in the pre-vaccination period smallpox\r\nwas nine times as fatal as measles and seven and one half times\r\nas fatal as whooping cough. To-day in the vaccinated community\r\nits fatality is negligable, in the unvaccinated it is as high\r\nas it was in the Middle Ages. In the city of Berlin, where\r\nvaccination is absolutely compulsory, there is no smallpox\r\nhospital at all; the cases of smallpox in that city being only\r\na few unvaccinated foreigners. In 1912 the deaths in New York\r\nCity were as follow: 671 from measles, 614 from scarlatina, 500\r\nfrom typhoid fever, 187 from whooping cough and 2 from\r\nsmallpox.\r\n\r\nIn London there were in 48 years of the seventeenth century no\r\nless than 10 epidemics of smallpox; in the whole of the\r\neighteenth, 19; and in the nineteenth no epidemic at all during\r\nwhich smallpox was responsible for more than one tenth of the\r\ndeaths from all causes in any one year.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, the highest death-rate before vaccination was 7.23\r\nper 1,000 persons, the lowest 0.30; under permissive\r\nvaccination the highest was 2.57, the lowest 0.12; under\r\ncompulsory vaccination the highest was 0.94, the lowest 0.0005.\r\n\r\nIt is so frequently said that the disappearance of smallpox is\r\ndue not to vaccination, but to improved general hygiene, that\r\nwe must look into this criticism with some care. In the first\r\nplace, a large diminution in the mortality from smallpox\r\noccurred before there was any great change in the unsanitary\r\nconditions of the English towns, before there was any enforcing\r\nof the isolation of patients either in hospitals or in their\r\nown homes. Since the introduction of vaccination, measles and\r\nwhooping cough still remain in the status quo ante, while\r\nsmallpox has been exterminated in all fully vaccinated\r\ncommunities, these two diseases of children are as prevalent as\r\never in England even although the general sanitary conditions\r\nhave been immensely improved in that country. Of course the\r\neffects of vaccination wear out in time, and that is why it is\r\nwell to be revaccinated once or twice. Now there has been a\r\nremarkable progressive change in the age-incidence of smallpox\r\n\"which can only be explained,\" says Dr. Newsholme, \"on the\r\nassumption that vaccination protects children from smallpox and\r\nthat the protection diminishes, though it never entirely\r\ndisappears, as age advances.\r\n\r\nThe \"conscience clause\" should be immediately removed from the\r\nact in which it was inserted on the grounds that it is weak and\r\nreactionary in principle, not in the interests of the\r\ndevelopment of the legislative aspect of the science of public\r\nhealth, and that it permits in certain unintelligent\r\ncommunities quite a considerable number of unvaccinated\r\nchildren to grow up as a permanent menace to their town and\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nWhen the history of medicine becomes more widely known, when\r\nthe principles of prophylactic inoculation are more generally\r\nunderstood, when respect for science is the rule rather than\r\nthe exception, when great achievements in the saving rather\r\nthan the destroying of life are objects of national veneration,\r\nthen we may hope to see the day when it will be unhesitatingly\r\nadmitted that the discovery by Dr. Edward Jenner, the\r\nEnglishman, was one of the most momentous in the history of the\r\nhuman race, and that his life was one of the noblest, most\r\nunselfish and, in its far-reaching effects, most important that\r\nhas ever been lived on this planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH\r\n\r\nBY W. A. HAMOR\r\n\r\nMELLON INSTITUTE OF INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF\r\nPITTSBURGH\r\n\r\nTHE aim of all industrial operations is toward perfection, both\r\nin process and mechanical equipment, and every development in\r\nmanufacturing creates new problems. It is only to be expected,\r\ntherefore, that the industrial researcher is becoming less and\r\nless regarded as a burden unwarranted by returns.\r\nIndustrialists have, in fact, learned to recognize chemistry as\r\nthe intelligence department of industry, and manufacturing is\r\naccordingly becoming more and more a system of scientific\r\nprocesses. The accruement of technical improvements in\r\nparticularly the great chemical industry is primarily dependent\r\nupon systematic industrial research, and this is being\r\nincreasingly fostered by American manufacturers.\r\n\r\nTen thousand American chemists are at present engaged in\r\npursuits which affect over 1,000,000 wage-earners and produce\r\nover $5,000,000,000 worth of manufactured products each year.\r\nThese trained men have actively and effectively collaborated in\r\nbringing about stupendous results in American industry. There\r\nare, in fact, at least nineteen American industries in which\r\nthe chemist has been of great assistance, either in founding\r\nthe industry, in developing it, or in refining the methods of\r\ncontrol or of manufacture, thus ensuring profits, lower costs\r\nand uniform outputs.\r\n\r\nAt the recent symposium on the contributions of the chemist to\r\nAmerican industries, at the fiftieth meeting of the American\r\nChemical Society in New Orleans, the industrial achievements of\r\nthat scientific scout, the chemist, were brought out\r\nclearly.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] In this connection, see Hesse, J. Ind. Eng. Chem., 7\r\n(1915), 293.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemist has made the wine industry reasonably independent\r\nof climatic conditions; he has enabled it to produce\r\nsubstantially the same wine, year in and year out, no matter\r\nwhat the weather; he has reduced the spoilage from 25 per cent.\r\nto 0.46 per cent. of the total; he has increased the shipping\r\nradius of the goods and has made preservatives unnecessary. In\r\nthe copper industry he has learned and has taught how to make\r\noperations so constant and so continuous that in the\r\nmanufacture of blister copper valuations are less than $1.00\r\napart on every $10,000 worth of product and in refined copper\r\nthe valuations of the product do not differ by more than $1.00\r\nin every $50,000 worth of product. The quality of output is\r\nmaintained constant within microscopic differences. Without the\r\nchemist the corn-products industry would never have arisen and\r\nin 1914 this industry consumed as much corn as was grown in\r\nthat year by the nine states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey\r\nand Delaware combined; this amount is equal to the entire\r\nproduction of the state of North Carolina and about 80 per\r\ncent. of the production of each of the states of Georgia,\r\nMichigan and Wisconsin; the chemist has produced over 100\r\nuseful commercial products from corn, which, without him, would\r\nnever have been produced. In the asphalt industry the chemist\r\nhas taught how to lay a road surface that will always be good,\r\nand he has learned and taught how to construct a suitable road\r\nsurface for different conditions of service. In the cottonseed\r\noil industry, the chemist standardized methods of production,\r\nreduced losses, increased yields, made new use of wastes and\r\nby-products, and has added somewhere between $10 and $12 to the\r\nvalue of each bale of cotton grown. In the cement industry, the\r\nchemist has ascertained new ingredients, has utilized\r\ntheretofore waste products for this purpose, has reduced the\r\nwaste heaps of many industries and made them his starting\r\nmaterial; he has standardized methods of manufacture,\r\nintroduced methods of chemical control and has insured\r\nconstancy and permanency of quality and quantity of output. In\r\nthe sugar industry, the chemist has been active for so long a\r\ntime that \"the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.\" The\r\nsugar industry without the chemist is unthinkable. The Welsbach\r\nmantle is distinctly a chemist's invention and its successful\r\nand economical manufacture depends largely upon chemical\r\nmethods. It would be difficult to give a just estimate of the\r\neconomic effect of this device upon illumination, so great and\r\nvaluable is it. In the textile industry, he has substituted\r\nuniform, rational, well-thought out and simple methods of\r\ntreatment of all the various textile fabrics and fibers where\r\nmystery, empiricism, \"rule-of-thumb\" and their accompanying\r\nuncertainties reigned. In the fertilizer industry, it was the\r\nchemist who learned and who taught how to make our immense beds\r\nof phosphate rock useful and serviceable to man in the\r\nenrichment of the soil; he has taught how to make waste\r\nproducts of other industries useful and available for\r\nfertilization and he has shown how to make the gas works\r\ncontribute to the fertility of the soil. In the soda industry,\r\nthe chemist can successfully claim that he has founded it,\r\ndeveloped it and brought it to its present state of perfection\r\nand utility, but not without the help of other technical men;\r\nthe fundamental ideas were and are chemical. In the leather\r\nindustry, the chemist has given us all of the modern methods of\r\nmineral tanning, and without them the modern leather industry\r\nis unthinkable. In the case of vegetable-tanned leather he has\r\nalso stepped in, standardized the quality of incoming material\r\nand of outgoing product. In the flour industry the chemist has\r\nlearned and taught how to select the proper grain for specific\r\npurposes, to standardize the product, and how to make flour\r\navailable for certain specific culinary and food purposes. In\r\nthe brewing industry, the chemist has standardized the methods\r\nof determining the quality of incoming material and of outgoing\r\nproducts, and has assisted in the development of a product of a\r\nquality far beyond that obtaining prior to his entry into that\r\nindustry. In the preservation of foods, the chemist made the\r\nfundamental discoveries; up to twenty years ago, however, he\r\ntook little or no part in the commercial operations, but now is\r\nalmost indispensable to commercial success. In the water supply\r\nof cities, the chemist has put certainty in the place of\r\nuncertainty; he has learned and has shown how, by chemical\r\nmethods of treatment and control, raw water of varying quality\r\ncan be made to yield potable water of substantially uniform\r\ncomposition and quality. The celluloid industry and the\r\nnitro-cellulose industry owe their very existence and much of\r\ntheir development to the chemist. In the glass industry the\r\nchemist has learned and taught how to prepare glasses suitable\r\nfor the widest ranges of uses and to control the quality and\r\nquantity of the output. In the pulp and paper industry, the\r\nchemist made the fundamental observations, inventions and\r\noperations and to-day he is in control of all the operations of\r\nthe plant itself; to the chemist also is due the cheap\r\nproduction of many of the materials entering into this\r\nindustry, as well as the increased and expanding market for the\r\nproduct itself.\r\n\r\nSufficient has been presented to show that certain industries\r\nof the United States have been elevated by an infusion of\r\nscientific spirit through the medium of the chemist, and that\r\nmanufacturing, at one time entirely a matter of empirical\r\njudgment and individual skill, is more and more becoming a\r\nsystem of scientific processes. The result is that American\r\nmanufacturers are growing increasingly appreciative of\r\nscientific research, and are depending upon industrial\r\nresearchers--\"those who catalyze raw materials by brains\"--as\r\ntheir pathfinders. It is now appropriate to consider just how\r\nindustrialists are taking advantage of the universities and the\r\nproducts of these.\r\n\r\nTHE METHODS EMPLOYED IN THE ATTACK OF INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS[2]\r\n\r\n[2] See also Bacon, Science, N. S., 40 (1914), 871.\r\n\r\nWhen an industry has problems requiring solution, these\r\nproblems can be attacked either inside or outside of the plant.\r\nIf the policy of the industrialist is that all problems are to\r\nbe investigated only within the establishment, a research\r\nlaboratory must be provided for the plant or for the company.\r\nAt present, in the United States, probably not more than one\r\nhundred chemical manufacturing establishments have research\r\nlaboratories or employ research chemists, although at least\r\nfive companies are spending over $100,000 per year in research.\r\nIn Germany, and perhaps also in England, such research\r\nlaboratories in connection with chemical industries have been\r\nmuch more common. The great laboratories of the Badische Anilin\r\nund Soda Fabrik and of the Elberfeld Company are striking\r\nexamples of the importance attached to such research work in\r\nGermany, and it would be difficult to adduce any stronger\r\nargument in support of its value than the marvelous\r\nachievements of these great firms.\r\n\r\nA frequent difficulty encountered in the employment of\r\nresearchers or in the establishment of a research laboratory,\r\nis that many manufacturers have been unable to grasp the\r\nimportance of such work, or know how to treat the men in charge\r\nso as to secure the best results. The industrialist may not\r\neven fully understand just what is the cause of his\r\nmanufacturing losses or to whom to turn for aid. If he\r\neventually engages a researcher, he is sometimes likely to\r\nregard him as a sort of master of mysteries who should be able\r\nto accomplish wonders, and, if he can not see definite results\r\nin the course of a few months, is occasionally apt to consider\r\nthe investment a bad one and to regard researchers, as a class,\r\nas a useless lot. It has not been unusual for the chemist to be\r\ntold to remain in his laboratory, and not to go in or about the\r\nworks, and he must also face the natural opposition of workmen\r\nto any innovations, and reckon with the jealousies of foremen\r\nand of various officials.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the manufacturer, one decided advantage\r\nof the policy of having all problems worked out within the\r\nplant is that the results secured are not divulged, but are\r\nstored away in the laboratory archives and become part of the\r\nassets and working capital of the corporation which has paid\r\nfor them; and it is usually not until patent applications are\r\nfiled that this knowledge, generally only partially and\r\nimperfectly, becomes publicly known. When it is not deemed\r\nnecessary to take out patents, such knowledge is often\r\npermanently buried.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of the dissemination of knowledge concerning\r\nindustrial practice, it must be evident to all that there is\r\nbut little cooperation between manufacturers and the\r\nuniversities. Manufacturers, and especially chemical\r\nmanufacturers, have been quite naturally opposed to publishing\r\nany discoveries made in their plants, since \"knowledge is\r\npower\" in manufacturing as elsewhere, and new knowledge gained\r\nin the laboratories of a company may often very properly be\r\nregarded as among the most valuable assets of the concern. The\r\nuniversities and the scientific societies, on the other hand,\r\nexist for the diffusion of knowledge, and from their standpoint\r\nthe great disadvantage of the above policy is this concealment\r\nof knowledge, for it results in a serious retardation of the\r\ngeneral growth and development of science in its broader\r\naspects, and renders it much more difficult for the\r\nuniversities to train men properly for such industries, since\r\nall the text-books and general knowledge available would in all\r\nprobability be far behind the actual manufacturing practice.\r\nFortunately, the policy of industrial secrecy is becoming more\r\ngenerally regarded in the light of reason, and there is a\r\ngrowing inclination among manufacturers to disclose the details\r\nof investigations, which, according to tradition, would be\r\ncarefully guarded. These manufacturers appreciate the facts\r\nthat public interest in chemical achievements is stimulating to\r\nfurther fruitful research, that helpful suggestions and\r\ninformation may come from other investigators upon the\r\npublication of any results, and that the exchange of knowledge\r\nprevents many costly repetitions.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL FELLOWSHIPS\r\n\r\nIf the manufacturer elects to refer his problem to the\r\nuniversity or technical school--and because of the facilities\r\nfor research to be had in certain institutions, industrialists\r\nare following this plan in constantly increasing numbers--such\r\nreference may take the form of an industrial fellowship and\r\nmuch has been said and may be said in favor of these\r\nfellowships. They allow the donor to keep secret for three\r\nyears the results secured, after which they may be published\r\nwith the donor's permission. They also secure to him patent\r\nrights. They give highly specialized training to properly\r\nqualified men, and often secure for them permanent positions\r\nand shares in the profits of their discoveries. It should be\r\nobvious at the outset that a fellowship of this character can\r\nbe successful only when there are close confidential relations\r\nobtaining between the manufacturer and the officer in charge of\r\nthe research; for no such cooperation can be really effective\r\nunless based upon a thorough mutual familiarity with the\r\nconditions and an abiding faith in the integrity and sincerity\r\nof purpose of each other. It is likely to prove a poor\r\ninvestment for a manufacturer to seek the aid of an\r\ninvestigator if he is unwilling to take such expert into his\r\nconfidence and to familiarize him with all the local and other\r\nfactors which enter into the problem from a manufacturing\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\nTHE MELLON INSTITUTE OF INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH[3]\r\n\r\n[3] For a detailed description of the Mellon Institute and its\r\nwork, see Bacon and Hamor, J. Ind. Eng. Chem., 7 (1915),\r\n326-48.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the system of industrial research in operation at\r\nthe Mellon Institute of Industrial Research of the University\r\nof Pittsburgh, which is not, in any sense of the word, a\r\ncommercial institution, a manufacturer having a problem\r\nrequiring solution may become the donor of a fellowship; the\r\nsaid manufacturer provides the salary of the researcher\r\nselected to conduct the investigation desired, the institute\r\nfurnishing such facilities as are necessary for the conduct of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nThe money paid in to found a fellowship is paid over by the\r\ninstitute in salary to the investigator doing the work. In\r\nevery case, this researcher is most carefully selected for the\r\nproblem in hand. The institute supplies free laboratory space\r\nand the use of all ordinary chemicals and equipment. The\r\nchemist or engineer who is studying the problem works under the\r\nimmediate supervision of men who are thoroughly trained and\r\nexperienced in conducting industrial research.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, the Mellon Institute, which, while an\r\nintegral part of the University of Pittsburgh, has its own\r\nendowment, is expending over $150,000 annually for salaries and\r\nmaintenance. A manufacturer secures for a small\r\nexpenditure--just sufficient to pay the salary of the fellow,\r\nas the man engaged on the investigation is called--all the\r\nbenefits of an organization of this size, and many have availed\r\nthemselves of the advantages, twenty-eight companies\r\nmaintaining fellowships at the present time.\r\n\r\nEach fellow has the benefit of the institute's very excellent\r\napparatus, chemical and library equipment--facilities which are\r\nso essential in modern research; and because of these\r\nopportunities and that of being able to pursue post-graduate\r\nwork for higher degrees, it has been demonstrated that a higher\r\ntype of researcher can be obtained by the institute for a\r\ncertain remuneration than can be generally secured by\r\nmanufacturers themselves. There is a scarcity of men gifted\r\nwith the genius for research, and it requires much experience\r\nin selecting suitable men and in training them to the desirable\r\ndegree of efficiency, after having determined the special\r\nqualities required. Important qualifications in industrial\r\nresearchers are keenness, inspiration and confidence; these are\r\noften unconsidered by manufacturers, who in endeavoring to\r\nselect, say, a research chemist, are likely to regard every\r\nchemist as a qualified scientific scout.\r\n\r\nAll researches conducted at the Mellon Institute are surrounded\r\nwith the necessary secrecy, and any and all discoveries made by\r\nthe fellow during the term of his fellowship become the\r\nproperty of the donor.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mellon Institute moved into its $350,000 home in\r\nFebruary, 1915, the industrial fellowship system in operation\r\ntherein passed out of its experimental stage. During the years\r\nof its development no inherent sign of weakness on the part of\r\nany one of its constituent factors appeared; in fact, the\r\nresults of the fellowships have been uniformly successful.\r\nWhile problems have been presented by companies which, upon\r\npreliminary investigation, have proved to be so difficult as to\r\nbe practically impossible of solution, there have been so many\r\nother problems confronting these companies that important ones\r\nwere found which lent themselves to solution; and often the\r\ncompanies did not realize, until after investigations were\r\nstarted, just what the exact nature of their problems was and\r\njust what improvements and savings could be made in their\r\nmanufacturing processes.\r\n\r\nFellowships at the Mellon Institute are constantly increasing\r\nin the amounts subscribed by industrialists for their\r\nmaintenance and, as well, in their importance. The renewal,\r\nyear after year, of such fellowships, as those on baking,\r\npetroleum and ores, goes to show the confidence which\r\nindustrialists have in the Mellon Institute. Again, the large\r\nsums of money which are being spent by companies in bringing\r\nsmall unit plants to develop the processes which have been\r\nworked out in the laboratory, demonstrate that practical\r\nresults are being secured.\r\n\r\nWhere there have been sympathy and hearty cooperation between\r\nthe Mellon Institute and the company concerned, the institute\r\nhas been able to push through to a successful conclusion large\r\nscale experiments in the factory of the company, which in the\r\nbeginning of the fellowship seemed almost impossible: it may be\r\nsaid that the results of the fellowships at the Mellon\r\nInstitute indicate that a form of service to industry has been\r\nestablished, the possibilities of which no man can say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW CLASSIC UNKNOWNS IN MATHEMATICS\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR G. A. MILLER\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS\r\n\r\nKING HIERO is said to have remarked, in view of the marvelous\r\nmechanical devices of Archimedes, that he would henceforth\r\ndoubt nothing that had been asserted by Archimedes. This spirit\r\nof unbounded confidence in those who have exhibited unusual\r\nmathematical ability is still extant. Even our large city\r\npapers sometimes speak of a mathematical genius who could solve\r\nevery mathematical problem that was proposed to him. The\r\nnumerous unexpected and far-reaching results contained in the\r\nelementary mathematical text-books, and the ease with which the\r\nskilful mathematics teachers often cleared away what appeared\r\nto be great difficulties to the students have filled many with\r\na kind of awe for unusual mathematical ability.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the unbounded confidence in mathematical\r\nresults has been somewhat shaken by a wave of mathematical\r\nskepticism which gained momentum through some of the popular\r\nwritings of H. Poincare and Bertrand Russell. As instances of\r\nexpressions which might at first tend to diminish such\r\nconfidence we may refer to Poincare's contention that\r\ngeometrical axioms are conventions guided by experimental facts\r\nand limited by the necessity to avoid all contradictions, and\r\nto Russell's statement that \"mathematics may be defined as the\r\nsubject in which we never know what we are talking about nor\r\nwhether what we are saying is true.\"\r\n\r\nThe mathematical skepticism which such statements may awaken is\r\nusually mitigated by reflection, since it soon appears that\r\nphilosophical difficulties abound in all domains of knowledge,\r\nand that mathematical results continue to inspire relatively\r\nthe highest degrees of confidence. The unknowns in mathematics\r\nto which we aim to direct attention here are not of this\r\nphilosophical type but relate to questions of the most simple\r\nnature. It is perhaps unfortunate that in the teaching of\r\nelementary mathematics the unknowns receive so little\r\nattention. In fact, it seems to be customary to direct no\r\nattention whatever to the unsolved mathematical difficulties\r\nuntil the students begin to specialize in mathematics in the\r\ncolleges or universities.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest opportunities to impress on the student the\r\nfact that mathematical knowledge is very limited in certain\r\ndirections presents itself in connection with the study of\r\nprime numbers. Among the small prime numbers there appear many\r\nwhich differ only by 2. For instance, 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and\r\n13, 17 and 19, 29 and 31, constitute such pairs of prime\r\nnumbers. The question arises whether there is a limit to such\r\npairs of primes, or whether beyond each such pair of prime\r\nnumbers there must exist another such pair.\r\n\r\nThis question can be understood by all and might at first\r\nappear to be easy to answer, yet no one has succeeded up to the\r\npresent time in finding which of the two possible answers is\r\ncorrect. It is interesting to note that in 1911 E. Poincare\r\ntransmitted a note written by M. Merlin to the Paris Academy of\r\nSciences in which a theorem was announced from which its author\r\ndeduced that there actually is an infinite number of such prime\r\nnumber pairs, but this result has not been accepted because no\r\ndefinite proof of the theorem in question was produced.\r\n\r\nAnother unanswered question which can be understood by all is\r\nwhether every even number is the sum of two prime numbers. It\r\nis very easy to verify that each one of the small even numbers\r\nis the sum of a pair of prime numbers, if we include unity\r\namong the prime numbers; and, in 1742, C. Goldbach expressed\r\nthe theorem, without proof, that every possible even number is\r\nactually the sum of at least one pair of prime numbers. Hence\r\nthis theorem is known as Goldbach's theorem, but no one has as\r\nyet succeeded in either proving or disproving it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the proof or the disproof of such theorems may not\r\nappear to be of great consequence, yet the interdependence of\r\nmathematical theorems is most marvelous, and the mathematical\r\ninvestigator is attracted by such difficulties of long\r\nstanding. These particular difficulties are mentioned here\r\nmainly because they seem to be among the simplest illustrations\r\nof the fact that mathematics is teeming with classic unknowns\r\nas well as with knowns. By classic unknowns we mean here those\r\nthings which are not yet known to any one, but which have been\r\nobjects of study on the part of mathematicians for some time.\r\nAs our elementary mathematical text-books usually confine\r\nthemselves to an exposition of what has been fully established,\r\nand hence is known, the average educated man is led to believe\r\ntoo frequently that modern mathematical investigations relate\r\nentirely to things which lie far beyond his training.\r\n\r\nIt seems very unfortunate that there should be, on the part of\r\neducated people, a feeling of total isolation from the\r\ninvestigations in any important field of knowledge. The modern\r\nmathematical investigator seems to be in special danger of\r\nisolation, and this may be unavoidable in many cases, but it\r\ncan be materially lessened by directing attention to some of\r\nthe unsolved mathematical problems which can be most easily\r\nunderstood. Moreover, these unsolved problems should have an\r\neducational value since they serve to exhibit boundaries of\r\nmodern scientific achievements, and hence they throw some light\r\non the extent of these achievements in certain directions.\r\n\r\nBoth of the given instances of unanswered classic questions\r\nrelate to prime numbers. As an instance of one which does not\r\nrelate to prime numbers we may refer to the question whether\r\nthere exists an odd perfect number. A perfect number is a\r\nnatural number which is equal to the sum of its aliquot parts.\r\nThus 6 is perfect because it is equal to 1 + 2 + 3, and 28 is\r\nperfect because it is equal to 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. Euclid\r\nstated a formula which gives all the even perfect numbers, but\r\nno one has ever succeeded in proving either the existence or\r\nthe non-existence of an odd perfect number. A considerable\r\nnumber of properties of odd perfect numbers are known in case\r\nsuch numbers exist.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a very noted professor in Berlin University developed\r\na series of properties of odd perfect numbers in his lectures\r\non the theory of numbers, and then followed these developments\r\nwith the statement that it is not known whether any such\r\nnumbers exist. This raises the interesting philosophical\r\nquestion whether one can know things about what is not known to\r\nexist; but the main interest from our present point of view\r\nrelates to the fact that the meaning of odd perfect number is\r\nso very elementary that all can easily grasp it, and yet no one\r\nhas ever succeeded in proving either the existence or the\r\nnon-existence of such numbers.\r\n\r\nIt would not be difficult to increase greatly the number of the\r\ngiven illustrations of unsolved questions relating directly to\r\nthe natural numbers. In fact, the well-known greater Fermat\r\ntheorem is a question of this type, which does not appear more\r\nimportant intrinsically than many others but has received\r\nunusual attention in recent years on account of a very large\r\nprize offered for its solution. In view of the fact that those\r\nwho have become interested in this theorem often experience\r\ndifficulty in finding the desired information in any English\r\npublication, we proceed to give some details about this theorem\r\nand the offered prize. The following is a free translation of a\r\npart of the announcement made in regard to this prize by the\r\nKonigliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, Gottingen, Germany:\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the bequest left to us by the deceased Dr. Paul\r\nWolskehl, of Darmstadt, a prize of 100,000 mk., in words, one\r\nhundred thousand marks, is hereby offered to the one who will\r\nfirst succeed to produce a proof of the great Fermat theorem.\r\nDr. Wolfskehl remarks in his will that Fermat had maintained\r\nthat the equation\r\n\r\nx <superscript Greek 1> + y <superscript Greek 1> =\r\nz <superscript Greek 1>\r\n\r\ncould not be satisfied by integers whenever <Greek l> is an odd\r\nprime number. This Fermat theorem is to be proved either\r\ngenerally in the sense of Fermat, or, in supplementing the\r\ninvestigations by Kummer, published in Crelle's Journal, volume\r\n40, it is to be proved for all values of <Grrek 1> for which it\r\nis actually true. For further literature consult Hibert's\r\nreport on the theory of algebraic number realms, published in\r\nvolume 4 of the Jahreshericht der Deutschen\r\nMathernatiker-Vereinigung, and volume 1 of the Encyklopadie der\r\nmathematischen Wissenschaften.\r\n\r\nThe prize is offered under the following more particular\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe Konigliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften in Gottingen\r\ndecides independently on the question to whom the prize shall\r\nbe awarded. Manuscripts intended to compete for the prize will\r\nnot be received, but, in awarding the prize only such\r\nmathematical papers will be considered as have appeared either\r\nin the regular periodicals or have been published in the form\r\nof monographs or books which were for sale in the book-stores.\r\nThe Gesellschaft leaves it to the option of the author of such\r\na paper to send to it about five printed copies.\r\n\r\nAmong the additional stipulations it may be of interest to note\r\nthat the prize will not be awarded before at least two years\r\nhave elapsed since the first publication of the paper which is\r\nadjudged as worthy of the prize. In the meantime the\r\nmathematicians of various countries are invited to express\r\ntheir opinion as regards the correctness of this paper. The\r\nsecretary of the Gesellschaft will write to the person to whom\r\nthe prize is awarded and will also publish in various places\r\nthe fact that the award has been made. If the prize has not\r\nbeen awarded before September 13, 2007, no further applications\r\nwill be considered.\r\n\r\nWhile this prize is open to the people of all countries it has\r\nbecome especially well known in Germany, and hundreds of\r\nGermans from a very noted university professor of mathematics\r\nto engineers, pastors, teachers, students, bankers, officers,\r\netc., have published supposed proofs. These publications are\r\nfrequently very brief, covering only a few pages, and usually\r\nthey disclose the fact that the author had no idea in regard to\r\nthe real nature of the problem or the meaning of a mathematical\r\nproof. In a few cases the authors were fully aware of the\r\nrequirements but were misled by errors in their work. Although\r\nthe prize was formally announced more than seven years ago no\r\npaper has as yet been adjudged as fulfilling the conditions.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to note in this connection that a\r\nmathematical proof implies a marshalling of mathematical\r\nresults, or accepted assumptions, in such a manner that the\r\nthing to be proved is a NECESSARY consequence. The\r\nnon-mathematician is often inclined to think that if he makes\r\nstatements which can not be successfully refuted he has carried\r\nhis point. In mathematics such statements have no real\r\nsignificance in an attempted proof. Unknowns must be labeled as\r\nsuch and must retain these labels until they become knowns in\r\nview of the conditions which they can be proved to satisfy. The\r\npure mathematician accepts only necessary conclusions with the\r\nexception that basal postulates have to be assumed by common\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical subject in which the student usually has to\r\ncontend most frequently with unknowns at the beginning of his\r\nstudies is the history of mathematics. The ancient Greeks had\r\nalready attempted to trace the development of every known\r\nconcept, but the work along this line appears still in its\r\ninfancy. Even the development of our common numerals is\r\nsurrounded with many perplexing questions, as may be seen by\r\nconsulting the little volume entitled \"The Hindu-Arabic\r\nNumerals,\" by D. E. Smith and L. C. Karpinski.\r\n\r\nThe few mathematical unknowns explicitly noted above may\r\nsuffice to illustrate the fact that the path of the\r\nmathematical student often leads around difficulties which are\r\nleft behind. Sometimes the later developments have enabled the\r\nmathematicians to overcome some of these difficulties which had\r\nstood in the way for more than a thousand years. This was done,\r\nfor instance, by Gauss when he found a necessary and sufficient\r\ncondition that a regular polygon of a prime number of sides can\r\nbe constructed by elementary methods. It was also done by\r\nHermite, Lindemann and others by proving that epsilon and rho\r\nare transcendental numbers. While such obstructions are thus\r\nbeing gradually removed some of the most ancient ones still\r\nremain, and new ones are rising rapidly in view of modern\r\ndevelopments along the lines of least resistance.\r\n\r\nThese obstructions have different effects on different people.\r\nSome fix their attention almost wholly on them and are thus\r\nimpressed by the lack of progress in mathematics, while others\r\noverlook them almost entirely and fix their attention on the\r\nroutes into new fields which avoid these difficulties. A\r\ncorrect view of mathematics seems to be the one which looks at\r\nboth, receiving inspiration from the real advances but not\r\nforgetting the desirability of making the developments as\r\ncontinuous as possible. At any rate the average educated man\r\nought to know that there is no mathematician who is able to\r\nsolve all the mathematical questions which could be proposed\r\neven by those having only slight attainments along this line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABORIGINAL ROCK-STENCILLINGS OF NEW SOUTH WALES\r\n\r\nBY DR. CHAS. B. DAVENPORT\r\n\r\nCOLD SPRING HARBOR, N. Y.\r\n\r\nIN a number of places in eastern Australia curious aboriginal\r\nmarkings are found on the faces of the sandstone cliffs. A good\r\nidea of them is given by the photographs. These came from\r\nWolgan Gap near Wallerang in the Blue Mountain region of New\r\nSouth Wales. They are found on overhanging rocks that have\r\nserved as shelters or camping places for the aborigines and\r\nwhich doubtless have protected their works of art.\r\n\r\nThese stencillings are made by a sort of spatter work,\r\nsomething like that in vogue a generation ago in this country,\r\nusing leaves, etc., as forms. The rocks at Wolgan Gap are a\r\ncoarse sandstone stained almost black by an iron oxide derived\r\nfrom included bands of ironstone. These black surfaces were\r\nselected by the artists. Nearby in the rock is a band of shale\r\nwhich had disintegrated at its exposed edge to a white powder.\r\nThe native artist put some of this white powder in his mouth,\r\nplaced his hand or foot upon the rock, and blew the moistened\r\npowder upon and around his outstretched fingers or toes. When\r\nhe removed them they were outlined on the rock. Since the\r\nsandstone is coarse and deeply pitted, the moist powder was\r\nblown into minute cavities where it has remained despite the\r\nerosive activities of some generations. The presence of the\r\npowder is shown on the photographs as a sort of halo around the\r\nobject. The hands are either right or left, and, in some cases,\r\nboth hands seem to have been stencilled at once. Sometimes the\r\nwhole arm and hand are stencilled together, and in one of the\r\nphotographs a boomerang is shown. The age of these stencils is\r\nnot known. They were first discovered at Wolgan Gap about sixty\r\nyears ago, but others have been known for a longer time, for\r\ninstance, those at Greenwich, Parametta River, near Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these stencillings has been the subject of\r\nsome controversy. The natives may have been induced to make\r\nthem as boys carve their names on benches or even rocks. The\r\nmaterials for making the stencillings were present and, the\r\nexample once having been set, others would emulate it. It is\r\ninteresting that similar stencillings of the hands were made by\r\ncave men on the walls of some of the European caves, as, for\r\ninstance, those of Aurignac in southern France. Evidently\r\nspatter work is no modern pastime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTES FOR WAR\r\n\r\nTHIS war, beyond measure disastrous to civilization, is a trial\r\nalso of our democracy. We may hope that it is an old-world war\r\nand an old-men's war, repugnant to the genius of our newer\r\nlife. The statements of some of our public men and the contents\r\nof some of our newspapers can not be read without\r\ndiscouragement. But it is also true that there has perhaps not\r\nappeared a cartoon in any American newspaper tending to glorify\r\nwar, and no legislation has so far been enacted in preparation\r\nfor war. There is good reason to believe that the people have\r\nnot been infected by the contagion of blood.\r\n\r\nAs Professor Patrick argued in a recent issue of the Monthly,\r\nman is by genetic inheritance a fighting and a playing animal,\r\nnot an animal delighting in steady work. The ape and the tiger\r\nwill be exterminated elsewhere in nature before they will be\r\nsuppressed in man. It is a slow process, but surely proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this note has determined the proportion of each\r\ncentury in which the leading nations have been engaged in war.\r\nThe curve thus found has no great reliability; for it does not\r\ntake into account the percentages of the peoples concerned, but\r\nits course clearly indicates that even under circumstances as\r\nthey have been, wars will come to an end. And there is good\r\nreason to believe that the newer condition--universal education\r\nand universal suffrage, democratic control, improved economic\r\nconditions of living for the people, the scientific\r\nattitude--will tend to bend the curve more rapidly toward the\r\nbase line of permanent \"peace on earth and good will to men.\"\r\n\r\nWhile man has inherited instincts which exhibit themselves in\r\nplaying and fighting, the same instincts may by social control\r\nbe diverted to playing the games of art or science, to fighting\r\ndisease and vice. It is rarely wise or feasible to attempt to\r\nsuppress instincts; they should be directed so as to provide\r\ndesirable conduct. Loyalty to family, to group, to neighborhood\r\nand to nation can not be lightly cast away for an abstract\r\ncosmopolitanism. But it can be expressed otherwise than by\r\nseizing everything in sight by cunning or by violence.\r\n\r\nWilliam James, the great psychologist, in one of his brilliant\r\nessays published in The Popular Science Monthly for October,\r\n1910, tells us that history is a bath of blood; we inherit the\r\nwar-like type; our ancestors have bred pugnacity into our bone\r\nand marrow; showing the irrationality and horror of war does\r\nnot prevent it; but a moral equivalent can be found by\r\nenlisting an army to toil and suffer pain in doing the hard and\r\nroutine work of the world. It is doubtful, however, if the\r\n\"gilded youths\" to whom James refers would accept\r\n\"dish-washing, clothes-washing and window-washing,\r\nroad-building and tunnel-making, foundries and stoke-holes,\" as\r\na substitute for war, and for the great mass of the people\r\nthere is more than enough of these things. It is to escape from\r\nthem that we seek excitement and adventure, intoxication by\r\ndrugs and war.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cannon, of Harvard University, proposes international\r\nfootball and other athletic contests as substitutes for war.\r\nThe adrenal glands, whose secretions excite the combative and\r\nmartial emotions, must function, and their activity, he argues,\r\ncan be directed in this way. Mr. Bryan has just now made the\r\nproposal that we build six great national roads by which armies\r\nmight be collected for defence; the secretary of the navy has\r\nfounded a Naval Inventions Board; the postmaster general has\r\nsuggested that aeroplanes be used to deliver mail in order that\r\nwe may have an aerial corps ready for service. There may be an\r\nelement of the absurd in some of these proposals, as there\r\nwould be in using submarines to catch cod fish, so that there\r\nmight be practise in building and managing such crafts for\r\npeaceful pursuits. There is, however, psychological\r\njustification for aiming to direct the emotions so that their\r\ndischarge is not destructive, but of benefit to the nation and\r\nto the world. Such would be the development of our national\r\nresources, the construction of railways, roads, waterworks and\r\nthe like; social and political reforms; progress in the care of\r\npublic health, in education and in scientific research. It is\r\nproposed that the next congress should spend half a billion\r\ndollars on the army and navy. It is possible that on a\r\nplebiscite vote, exactly under existing conditions, a majority\r\nwould vote to make the department of war a department of public\r\nworks, military defence being only one of its functions, and to\r\nspend the sum proposed on public works useful in case of war,\r\nbut not an incitement to war.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL WEALTH AND PUBLIC INDEBTEDNESS\r\n\r\nWHILE the lives and the wealth of the European nations are\r\nbeing sacrificed on a scale hitherto unparalleled, it is well\r\nin the interests of those nations, as well as of our own, that\r\nwe conserve the lives and wealth of our own people. The\r\ngreatest wealth of a nation is its children, its productive\r\nworkers, its scientific men and other leaders, its accumulated\r\nknowledge and social traditions. These are immeasurable, but\r\nthe Bureau of the Census has recently prepared a report on the\r\nmaterial wealth and indebtedness, according to which it is\r\nestimated that the total value of all classes of property in\r\nthe United States, exclusive of Alaska and the insular\r\npossessions, in 1912, was $187,739,000,000, or $1,965 per\r\ncapita. This estimate is presented merely as the best\r\napproximation which can be made from the data available and as\r\nbeing fairly comparable with that published eight years ago.\r\nThe increase between 1904 and 1912 was 75 per cent., for the\r\ntotal amount and 49 per cent. for the per capita. Real estate\r\nand improvements, including public property, alone constituted\r\n$110,677,000,000, or 59 per cent. of the total, in 1912. The\r\nnext greatest item, $16,149,000,000, was contributed by the\r\nrailroads; and the third, $14,694,000,000, represented the\r\nvalue of manufactured products, other than clothing and\r\npersonal adornments, furniture, vehicles and kindred property.\r\n\r\nThe net public-indebtedness in 1913 amounted to $4,850,461,000.\r\nThis amount was made up as follows: National debt,\r\n$1,028,564,000, or $10.59 per capita; state debt, $345,942,000,\r\nor $3.57 per capita; county debt, $371,528,000, or $4.33 per\r\ncapita; and municipal debt, $2,884,883,000, or $54.27 per\r\ncapita. Thus the average urban citizen's share of the net\r\nfederal, state, county and municipal debt combined was $72.76;\r\nand the average rural citizen's share of the net federal, state\r\nand county debt combined was $18.49.\r\n\r\nThe total federal debt in 1910 was $2,916,205,000, of which\r\namount $967,366,000 was represented by bonds, $375,682,000 by\r\nnon-interest-bearing debt (principally United States notes or\r\n\"greenbacks\"), and $1,573,157,000 by certificates and notes\r\nissued on deposits of coin and bullion. Against this\r\nindebtedness there was in the treasury $1,887,641,000 in cash\r\navailable for payment of debt, leaving the net national\r\nindebtedness at $1,028,564,000, or $10.59 per capita. The\r\nincrease in the net indebtedness between 1902 and 1913 amounted\r\nto 6 per cent., but for the per capita figure there was a\r\ndecrease of 13 per cent. The burden due to the national debt is\r\nthus very light in comparison with that imposed by the\r\nindebtedness of other great nations.\r\n\r\nThe state debt, however, rests still more easily on the\r\nshoulders of the average citizen, being only one third as great\r\nas that of the nation. The total state indebtedness in 1913 was\r\n$422,797,000, and the net debt--that is, the total debt less\r\nsinking-fund assets--was $345,942,000, or $3.57 per capita. The\r\nnet debt increased by 44.5 per cent. between 1902 and 1913, and\r\nthe per capita net debt by 18 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe total county debt in 1913 amounted to $393,207,000, of\r\nwhich amount $371,528,000, or $4.33 per capita, was net debt.\r\nThe net indebtedness increased by 89 per cent. between 1902 and\r\n1913, and the per capita net indebtedness by 55 per cent. By\r\nfar the greatest item of indebtedness in this country is that\r\nof municipalities. This amounted in 1913 to an aggregate of\r\n$3,460,000,000, of which $2,884,883,000, or $54.27 per capita,\r\nrepresented net indebtedness.

ALFRED GOLDSBOROUGH MAYER\r\n\r\nWITH their undaunted spirit for braving the wilds, the English\r\nentered New Guinea in 1885. For centuries the great island had\r\nremained a mere outline upon the map the fever-haunted glades\r\nof its vast swamps and the broken precipices of its mountain\r\nranges having defied exploration, more than the morose and\r\nsavage character of its inhabitants. Even in the summer of\r\n1913, Massy Baker the explorer, discovered a lake probably 100\r\nmiles or more in shore-line, which had remained hidden in the\r\nmidst of the dark forests of the Fly and Strickland River\r\nregions, and here savages still in the stone age, who had never\r\nseen a white man, measured the potency of their weapons against\r\nthe modern rifle.\r\n\r\nTo-day there are vast areas upon which the foot of the white\r\nman has not yet trodden, and of all the regions in the tropical\r\nworld New Guinea beckons with most alluring fascination to him\r\nto whom adventure is dearer than life.\r\n\r\nFar back in the dawn of European exploration, the Portuguese\r\nvoyager Antonio de Abreu, may have seen the low shores of\r\nwestern New Guinea, but it is quite certain that sixteen years\r\nlater, in 1527, Don Jorge de Meneses cruised along the coast\r\nand observed the wooly-headed natives whom he called \"Papuas.\"\r\nThe name \"New Guinea\" was bestowed upon the island by the\r\nSpanish captain, Ynigo Ortz de Retes, in 1515, when he saw the\r\nnegroid natives of its northern shores.\r\n\r\nThen there came and passed some of the world's greatest\r\nnavigators. Torres wandering from far Peru, to unknowingly\r\ndiscover the strait which bears his name; Dampier, the\r\nbuccancer-adventurer, and, in 1768, the cultured, esthetic\r\nBougainville, who was enraptured by the beauty of the deep\r\nforest-fringed fjords of the northeastern coast. Cook, greatest\r\nof all geographers, mapped the principal islands and shoals of\r\nthe intricate Torres Strait in 1770; and a few years later came\r\nCaptain Bligh, the resourceful leader of his faithful few,\r\ncrouching in their frail sail boat that had survived many a\r\ntempest; since the mutineers of the Bounty had cast them adrift\r\nin the mid-Pacific. In the early years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the scientifically directed Astrolabe arrived, under\r\nthe command of Dumont D'Urville, and, later, Captain Owen\r\nStanley in the Rattlesnake, with Huxley as his zoologist, Then,\r\nin 1858, came Alfred Russel Wallace, the codiscoverer of\r\nDarwinism, who, by the way, is said to have been the first\r\nEnglishman who ever actually resided in New Guinea.\r\n\r\nThe daring explorers and painstaking surveyors came and went,\r\nbut the great island remained a land of dread and mystery,\r\nguarded by the jagged reefs of its eastern shores, and the\r\nshallow mud flats, stretching far to sea-ward beyond the mouths\r\nof the great rivers of its southern coast. So inaccessible was\r\nPapua that even the excellent harbor of Port Moresby, the site:\r\nof the present capital, was not discovered until 1873. One has\r\nbut to stifle for a while in the heavy air that flows lifeless\r\nand fetid over the lowlands as if from a steaming furnace, or\r\nto scent the rank odors of the dark swamps, where for centuries\r\nmalaria must linger, to appreciate the reason for the\r\nlong-delayed European settlement of the country. But those who\r\nblaze the path of colonial progress are not to be deterred by\r\ntemperatures or smells; let us remember that Batavia, \"the\r\nwhite man's graveyard,\" is now one of the world's great\r\ncommercial centers; and Jamaica, the old fever camp of the\r\nBritish army, is now a health resort for tourists.\r\n\r\nPapua, the land of the tired eyes and the earnest face, of the\r\nwilling spirit and the weary body, waning as strength fails\r\nyear by year in malaria and heat, the land wherein the heart\r\naches for the severed ties of wife and home; its history has\r\nhardly yet begun, but the reward of generations of heroism will\r\nbe the conquest of another empire where England's high\r\nstandards of freedom are to he raised anew. A victory of peace\r\nit is to be, as noble as any yet achieved in war; and great\r\nthrough its death roll, and forgotten though the workers be,\r\nthe fruits of their labors will bless that better world Great\r\nBritain is preparing for those of ages yet to come.\r\n\r\nThere are great resources in Papua with its area of 90,500\r\nsquare miles. Untrodden forests where the dark soil moulders\r\nbeneath the everlasting shade; swamps bearing a harvest of\r\nthousands of sago and nipa palms, and mountains in a riot of\r\ncontorted peaks rising to a height of 13,200 feet in the Owen\r\nStanley range.\r\n\r\nIt is still a country of surprises, as when petroleum fields,\r\nprobably 1,000 square miles in area, were discovered only about\r\nfour years ago along the Vailala River, the natives having\r\nconcealed their knowledge of the bubbling gas springs through\r\nfear of offending the evil spirits of the place. It is evident\r\nthat although the country has been merely glanced over, there\r\nare both agricultural and mineral resources of a promising\r\nnature in Papua. It remains but for modern medicine to\r\nover-come the infections of the tropics for the region to rise\r\ninto prominence as one of the self-supporting colonies of the\r\nBritish empire.\r\n\r\nThe early history of British occupation centers around the\r\nstriking personality of James Chalmers, the great-hearted,\r\nbroad-minded, missionary, one of the most courageous who ever\r\ndevoted his life to extending the brotherhood of the white\r\nman's ideals. Chafing, as a young man, under the petty\r\nlimitations of his mission in the Cook Islands, he sought New\r\nGuinea, as being the wildest and most dangerous field in the\r\ntropical Pacific. Here, for twenty-five years, he devoted his\r\nmighty soul to the work of introducing the rudiments of\r\ncivilization and Christianity to the most sullen and dangerous\r\nsavages upon earth. Scores of times his life hung in the\r\nbalance of native caprice; wives and friends died by his side,\r\nvictims to the malignant climate and to native spears, while he\r\nseemed to possess a charmed life; until, true to his\r\nprediction, he was murdered by the cannibals of Dopina at the\r\nmouth of the Fly River in 1901.\r\n\r\nHundreds of scattered tribes had learned to revere their great\r\nleader \"Tamate,\" as they called him, who brought peace and\r\nprosperity to his followers. Yet a danger to Papua that he\r\nhimself foresaw and did all in his power to avert came as a\r\nresult of the introduction of the very civilization of which he\r\nwas the champion, for with peace came new wants that the most\r\nunscrupulous of traders at once sought to supply at prices\r\nruinous to the social and moral welfare of the natives.\r\n\r\nAlso, the proximity of Queensland threatened to become a\r\nmenace; for Chalmers himself was well aware of the dark history\r\nof the \"blackbird trade\" wherein practical slavery was forced\r\nupon the indentured laborers, lured from their island homes to\r\ntoil as hopeless debtors upon the Australian plantations. A\r\ngovernment of the natives for the native interests he desired;\r\nnot one administered from the Australian mainland in the\r\ninterest of alien whites. The hopes of Chalmers were only\r\npartially realized, for Papua is still only a territory of\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nIn most respects this condition appears to be unfortunate. The\r\ncrying needs of a new country are usually peculiarly local and\r\nnot likely to be appreciated by a distant ruling power.\r\nMoreover, Australia is itself an undeveloped land and requires\r\ntoo large a proportion of its own capital for expansion at home\r\nto be a competent protector of a colony across the sea. One\r\nfeels that Papuan development might have proceeded with greater\r\nsmoothness had the colony been more directly under the British\r\nempire, rather shall an Australian dependency.\r\n\r\nThe strategic necessity that Australia should command both the\r\nnorthern and the southern shores of Torres Straits might still\r\nhave been secured without the sacrifice of any important\r\ninitiative in matters of government upon the part of Papua.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal evil that Chalmers feared has, however, been\r\naverted. The natives still own 97 1/2 per cent. of the entire\r\nland area, and wise laws guard them in this precious\r\npossession, and aim to protect them from all manner of unjust\r\nexploitation. It is much to the credit of the government that\r\nthe cleanest native villages and the most healthy, ambitious\r\nand industrious tribes, are those nearest the white\r\nsettlements. Contact between the races has resulted in the\r\nbetterment, not in the degradation, of the Papuan natives.\r\n\r\nThe touch of a master hand is apparent in a multitude of\r\ndetails in managing the natives of Papua; and it is of interest\r\nto see that in broad essentials the plan of government is\r\nadapted from that which the English have put to the test of\r\npractice in Fiji; the modifications being of a character\r\ndesigned to meet the conditions peculiar to Melanesia, wherein\r\nthe chiefs are relatively unimportant in comparison with their\r\nrole in the social systems of the Polynesians and Fijians.\r\nForemost in the shaping of the destiny of Papua stands the\r\ncommanding figure of Sir William Macgregor, administrator and\r\nlieutenant governor from 1888 to 1898. As a young man Macgregor\r\nwas government physician in Fiji, where he became prominent not\r\nonly as a competent guardian of the health of the natives, but\r\nas a leader in the suppression of the last stronghold of\r\ncannibalism along the Singatoka River. In Papua his tireless\r\nspirit found a wide field for high endeavor, and upon every\r\ndepartment of the government one finds to-day the stamp of his\r\npowerful personality. Nor did he remain closeted in Port\r\nMoresby, a stranger to the races of his vast domains, for over\r\nthe highest mountains and through the densest swamps his\r\nexpeditions forced their way; the Great Governor always in the\r\nvan. It was thus that he conquered the fierce Tugeri of the\r\nDutch border, who for generations had been the terror of the\r\ncoasts; and wherever his expeditions passed, peace followed,\r\nand the law of the British magistrate supplanted the caprice of\r\nthe sorcerer.\r\n\r\nBut his hardest fight was not with the mountain wilds or the\r\nmalarious morasses. It was to secure from the powerful ones of\r\nhis own race the privileges of freemen for the natives of\r\nPapua.\r\n\r\nIn his youth he had seen the blessings that came with the\r\nadvent of British rule in Fiji; and here, in broad New Guinea,\r\nupon a vaster scale, he strove to make fair play the dominant\r\nnote in the white man's treatment of a savage race.\r\n\r\nArrayed against Chalmers and Macgregor were conservatism and\r\nsuspicion founded in ancient precedent, and a commercial\r\navarice that saw in native exploitation the readiest means to\r\nconvert New Guinea into a \"white man's country.\" Aversion there\r\nwas also in high places to embarking upon a possibly fruitless\r\nexperiment, involving generations of labor and expense for a\r\nremote and uncertain harvest. Chalmers and Macgregor, however,\r\nthrough the force of their high convictions and the wisdom of\r\ntheir wide experience, won the great fight for fairness; for\r\ncivilization's cardinal victories are those, not of the\r\nsoldier, but of the civil servant who dares risk his reputation\r\nand his all for those things he deems just and generous; and\r\nwhen Papua comes to erect statues to her great leaders, those\r\nof these two patriots must surely occupy the highest places, as\r\nchampions of the liberties of the weak. The noble policy of\r\nMacgregor is still, and let us hope it long may be, the keynote\r\nof the administration in Papua, which to-day is being ably\r\ncarried forward under the great governor's disciple, the\r\nHonorable John H. P. Murray.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation given by Captain Erskine in 1884 declared that\r\na British Protectorate had become essential for the\r\nsafeguarding of the lives and property of the natives of New\r\nGuinea and for the purpose of preventing the occupation of the\r\ncountry by persons whose proceedings might lead to injustice,\r\nstrife and bloodshed, or whose illegitimate trade might\r\nendanger the liberties and alienate the lands of the natives.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, one thing for a government to declare its\r\naltruistic intentions, but often quite another to carry them\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nIn Papua, every effort has been made to prevent robbery of the\r\nnatives by unscrupulous whites. The natives are firmly secured\r\nin the possession of their lands, which they can neither sell,\r\nlease nor dispose of, except to the government itself. Thus the\r\nnatives and the government are the only two landlords in the\r\ncountry. To acquire land in Papua, the European settler must\r\nrent it from the government, for he is not permitted to acquire\r\nfee simple rights. The whites are thus tenants of the\r\ngovernment, and are subject to such rules and regulations as\r\ntheir landlord may decree. The tenant is, however, recognized\r\nas the creator and owner of any improvements he may erect upon\r\nthe land, and, at the expiration of his lease, the government\r\nundertakes to pay him a fair compensation for such\r\nimprovements, provided he has lived up to the letter of\r\nregulations respecting his tenure.\r\n\r\nFor agricultural land a merely nominal rental is demanded,\r\nranging from nothing for the first ten years to a final maximum\r\nof six pence per acre; yet this system has had the effect of\r\nretarding European settlement, for, although its area is twice\r\nthat of Cuba, Papua had but 1,064 whites in 1912, and only one\r\none hundred and seventy-fourth of the territory is held under\r\nlease.\r\n\r\nMen of the type who can conquer the primeval forests and create\r\nindustries prefer to own their land outright, and are apt to\r\nresent the restrictions of complex government regulations,\r\nhowever wisely administered. Socialism, while it may in some\r\nmeasure be desirable in old and settled communities, serves but\r\nto dull that sense of personal freedom which above all spurs\r\nthe pioneer onward to success in a wild and dangerous region.\r\n\r\nPossibly in the end, the government may find it advantageous to\r\npermit certain lands to be acquired by Europeans, in fee\r\nsimple; for until this is done the settlement of the country\r\nmust proceed with extreme slowness. Moreover, mere tenants\r\nowning nothing but their improvements, and even these being\r\nsubject to government appraisement, may be unduly tempted to\r\ndrain, rather than to develop, the resources of the land they\r\noccupy.\r\n\r\nBut the chief aim of the Papuan government is to introduce\r\ncivilization among the natives, and a slow increase in the\r\nEuropean population is of primary necessity to the\r\naccomplishment of this result.\r\n\r\nAt present the natives are not taxed, the chief sources of\r\nrevenue being derived from the customs duties upon imports, the\r\nbulk of which are consumed by the Europeans, and this source of\r\nincome is supplemented by an annual grant of about 25,000\r\npounds from the Australian Commonwealth, but, due to the duties\r\nupon food and necessities, the cost of living is higher than it\r\nshould be in a new country.\r\n\r\nJudging, however, from the experience of the English in Fiji\r\nand of the Dutch in Java, the natives would be benefited rather\r\nthan oppressed by a moderate poll tax to be paid in produce,\r\nthus developing habits of industry, and in some measure\r\noffsetting the evil effects of that insidious apathy which\r\nfollows upon the sudden abolition of native warfare.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should also he made to encourage and educate the\r\nPapuans in the production and sale of manufactured articles.\r\nOne must regret the loss of many arts and crafts among the\r\nprimitive peoples of the Pacific, which, if properly fostered\r\nunder European protection to insure a market and an adequate\r\npayment for their wares, would have been a source of revenue\r\nand a factor of immeasurable import in developing that self\r\nrespect and confidence in themselves which the too sudden\r\nmodification of their social and religious Systems is certain\r\nto destroy. The ordinary mission schools are deficient in this\r\nrespect, devoting their major energies to the \"three R's\" and\r\nto religious instruction, and, while it is pleasing to observe\r\na boy whose father was a cannibal extracting cube roots, one\r\ncan not but conclude that the acquisition of some money-making\r\ntrade would be more conducive to his happiness in after life.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that the chief problem in dealing\r\nwith an erstwhile savage race is to overcome the universal loss\r\nof interest and decline in energy which inevitably follows upon\r\nthe development of that semblance of civilization which is\r\nenforced with the advent of the white man. The establishment of\r\nmanual training schools wherein arts and crafts which may be\r\nprofitably practiced by the natives as life-professions, is a\r\nfirst essential to the salvation of the race. These schools\r\nshould and would in no manner interfere with the religious\r\nteaching received from missionaries, but would indeed be a most\r\npotent factor in the spread of true Christianity among the\r\nnatives. Whether Christianity be true or false does not affect\r\nthe case, for the natives are destined to be dominated by\r\nChristian peoples, and it primarily essential that they should\r\nunderstand at least the rudiments of Christian ideals and\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nThe realization of the importance of training them to the\r\npursuit of useful arts and trades, which would enable the\r\nnatives to become self-supporting in the European sense, has\r\nbeen perceived by certain thinkers among the missionaries\r\nthemselves, and in certain regions efforts are being made the\r\nsuccess of which should revolutionize our whole method of\r\ndealing with the problem of introducing civilization among a\r\nprimitive people.\r\n\r\nKeep their minds active and their hands employed in\r\nself-supporting work and their morals and religion will safely\r\nfall into accord with Christian standards.\r\n\r\nUp to the present native education has been left to the devoted\r\nefforts of the missionaries, who have more than 10,000 pupils\r\nunder their charge, but the time is coming when the government\r\nshould cooperate in establishing trade schools wherein crafts,\r\nproviding life-vocations to the natives, may be taught.\r\n\r\nThere may be more than 275,000 natives in Papua, but, due to\r\nlack of knowledge of the country, the actual number is unknown.\r\n\r\nAmong the mountain fastnesses, defending themselves in\r\ntree-houses, one finds a frizzly-headed black negrito-like race\r\nhardly more than five feet in height. These are probably\r\nremnants of the \"pigmy\" pre-Dravidian or Negrito-Papuan\r\nelement, which constituted the most ancient inhabitants of the\r\nisland and who long ago were driven inland from the coveted\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe burly negroid Papuans of the Great River deltas of western\r\nPapua differ widely from the lithe, active, brown-skinned,\r\nmop-headed natives of the eastern half of the southern coast;\r\nand Professors Haddon and Seligmann have decided that in\r\neastern New Guinea many Proto-Polynesian, Melanesian and\r\nMalayan immigrants have mingled their blood with that of the\r\nmore primitive Papuans. Thus there are many complexly\r\nassociated ethnic elements in New Guinea, and often people\r\nliving less than a hundred miles apart can not understand one\r\nanother; in fact, each village has its peculiar dialect. Social\r\ncustoms and cultural standards in art and manufacture vary\r\ngreatly from the same cause, and each tribe has some remarkable\r\nindividual characteristics. In the Fly-River region, the\r\nvillage consists of a few huge houses with mere stalls for the\r\nfamilies, which crowd for defence under the shelter of a single\r\nroof. Along the southern side of the eastern end of the island,\r\nhowever, each family has its own little thatched hut, and these\r\nare often built for defense upon piling over the sea, reminding\r\none of the manner of life of the prehistoric Swiss-lake\r\ndwellers.\r\n\r\nNearly 12,000 natives are at present employed by the whites as\r\nindentured laborers in Papua, their terms of service ranging\r\nfrom three years, upon agricultural work, to not more than\r\neighteen months in mining. Their wages range from about $1.50\r\nto $5.00 per month, and all payments must be made in the\r\npresence of a magistrate and in coin or approved bank notes.\r\n\r\nAt every turn both employer and employed are wisely\r\nsafeguarded; the native suffering imprisonment for desertion,\r\nand the employer being prohibited from getting the blacks into\r\ndebt, or from treating them harshly or unjustly. Their\r\nenlistment must be voluntary and executed in the presence of a\r\nmagistrate, and, after their term of service, the employer is\r\nobliged to return them to their homes.\r\n\r\nOne is impressed with the many manifestations of a fair degree\r\nof efficiency on the part of the native laborers, who are\r\nreally good plantation hands and resourceful sailors. In fact,\r\ntrade has always been practiced to a considerable extent by the\r\nshore tribes, the pottery of the eastern end of the coast being\r\nannually exchanged for the sago produced by the natives of the\r\nFly River Delta. It is a picturesque sight to see the large\r\nlakatois, or trading canoes, creeping along in the shadow of\r\nthe palm-fringed shores under the great wall of the mountains,\r\nthe lakatoi consisting of a raft composed of six or more canoes\r\nlashed together side by side, and covered by a platform which\r\nbears a thatched hut serving to house the sailors and their\r\nwares. The craft is propelled by graceful crescent-shaped\r\nlateen sails of pandanus matting and steered by sweeps from the\r\nstern. Trading voyages of hundreds of miles are often\r\nundertaken, the lakatois starting from the east at the waning\r\nof the southeast trade wind in early November and returning a\r\nmonth or two later in the season of the northwest monsoon.\r\n\r\nThe Papuan is both ingenious and industrious when working in\r\nhis own interest, and with tactful management he becomes a\r\nfaithful and fairly efficient laborer. Perhaps the most serious\r\ndefect in the present system of employment in Papua is the\r\nusually long interval between payments. The natives are not\r\npaid at intervals of less than one month and, often, not until\r\nthe expiration of their three-year term of service. With almost\r\nno knowledge of arithmetic and possessed of a fund which seems\r\nlarge beyond the dreams of avarice, he is practically certain\r\nto be cheated by the dishonest tradesmen who flock vulture-like\r\nto centers of commercial activity. This evil might be in large\r\nmeasure prevented were the natives to be paid at monthly\r\nintervals, for they would then gradually become accustomed to\r\nthe handling of money and would gain an appreciation of its\r\nactual value.\r\n\r\nGenerations must elapse before more than a moderate degree of\r\ncivilization is developed in Papua, but the foundations are\r\nbeing surely and conservatively laid, and already in the\r\ncivilized centers natives respect and loyally serve their\r\nBritish friends and masters.\r\n\r\nIn common with many another British colony, the safeguard of\r\nPapua lies not in the rifles of the whites, but in the loyal\r\nhearts of the natives themselves, and in Papua, as in Fiji, the\r\nnative constabulary under the leadership of a mere handful of\r\nEuropeans may be trusted to maintain order in any emergency. As\r\nGovernor Murray truly states in his interesting book \"Papua, or\r\nBritish New Guinea,\" the most valuable asset the colony\r\npossesses is not its all but unexplored mineral wealth or the\r\npotential value of its splendid forests and rich soil, but it\r\nis the Papuans themselves, and let us add that under the\r\nleadership of the high-minded, self-sacrificing and\r\nwell-trained civil servants of Great Britain the dawn of Papuan\r\ncivilization is fast breaking into the sunlight of a happiness\r\nsuch as has come to but few of the erstwhile savage races of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nWithout belittling the nobility of purpose or disregarding the\r\nself-sacrificing devotion of the missionary for his task, let\r\nus also grant to the civil servant his due share of praise. His\r\nduty he also performs in the dangerous wilds of the earth;\r\nbeset with insidious disease, stifling in unending heat, exiled\r\nfrom home and friends, with suspicious savages around him, he\r\nlabors with waning strength in that struggle against climate\r\nwherein the ultimate ruin of his body is assured. Yet in his\r\nheart there lives, growing as years elapse, the English\r\ngentleman's ideal of service, and for him it is sufficient\r\nthat, though he is to be invalided and forgotten even before he\r\ndies, yet his will have been one of those rare spirits who have\r\nextended to the outer world his mother country's ideal of\r\njustice and fair play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT ELECTRIFICATION AND THE ELECTRIC CURRENT\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR FERNANDO SANFORD\r\n\r\nSTANFORD UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nIN a previous paper in this journal, entitled \"The Discovery of\r\nContact Electrification\" (November, 1913), it was shown that\r\nthe production of electric charges by the mere contact of two\r\ndissimilar metals was first discovered by Rev. Abraham Bennett,\r\nin 1789, and that it was verified by a different method by\r\nTiberius Cavallo, in 1795. Meantime, in 1791, Dr. Galvani\r\ndiscovered the twitching of a frog's muscle, due to electrical\r\nstimulus. Galvani's discovery was described by himself as\r\nfollows:[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Translation from \"Makers of Electricity,\" p 143.\r\n\r\n'I had dissected a frog and had prepared it, as in Figure 2 of\r\nthe fifth plate, and had placed it upon a table on which there\r\nwas an electric machine, while I set about doing certain other\r\nthings. The frog was entirely separated from the conductor of\r\nthe machine, and indeed was at no small distance away from it.\r\nWhile one of those who were assisting me touched lightly and by\r\nchance the point of his scalpel to the internal crural nerves\r\nof the frog, suddenly all the muscles of its limbs were seen to\r\nbe so contracted that they seemed to have fallen into tonic\r\nconvulsions. Another of my assistants, who was making ready to\r\ntake up certain experiments in electricity with me, seemed to\r\nnotice that this happened only at the moment when a spark came\r\nfrom the conductor of the machine. He was struck by the novelty\r\nof the phenomenon, and immediately spoke to me about it, for I\r\nwas at the moment occupied with other things and mentally\r\npreoccupied. I was at once tempted to repeat the experiment, so\r\nas to make clear whatever might be obscure in it. For this\r\npurpose I took up the scalpel and moved its point close to one\r\nor the other of the crural nerves of the frog, while at the\r\nsame time one of my assistants elicited sparks from the\r\nelectric machine. The phenomenon happened exactly as before.\r\nStrong contractions took place in every muscle of the limb, and\r\nat the very moment when the sparks appeared, the animal was\r\nseized as it were with tetanus.'\r\n\r\nFollowing this original observation, Galvani made a great many\r\nexperiments on the effect of electric stimulus upon the nerves\r\nof frogs and other animals. He found that the twitching of the\r\nfrog's muscles could be produced by atmospheric electricity,\r\nboth at the time of lightning and at other times when no\r\nlightning was visible. During these investigations he observed\r\nthat when the legs of the frog were suspended from an iron\r\nrailing by a hook through the spinal cord, and when this hook\r\nwas of some other metal than iron, the muscles would twitch\r\nwhenever the feet touched the iron railing. He tried out a\r\nnumber of pairs of metals, and found that when the nerve was\r\ntouched by one metal and the muscle or another point on the\r\nnerve was touched by another metal and the two metals were then\r\nbrought into contact or were connected through another metal or\r\nthrough the human body, the muscles would contract as they\r\nwould when stimulated by electricity.\r\n\r\nGalvani concluded that the contraction in this case, as in the\r\nearlier experiments, was produced by an electric stimulation,\r\nand since the metals seemed to him to serve merely as the\r\nconductors of the electric discharge, he concluded that the\r\nsource of the electricity must be in the tissues of the animal\r\nbody. This seemed all the more probable since it was known that\r\ncertain fishes and an electric eel were capable of giving\r\nviolent electric shocks. This electricity of the eels and\r\nfishes had been named animal electricity, and Galvani concluded\r\nthat all animals were capable of producing this electricity in\r\nthe tissues of their bodies.\r\n\r\nHe believed this electricity was to be found in various parts\r\nof the body, but that it was especially collected in the nerves\r\nand muscles. The especial property of this animal electricity\r\nseemed to be that it discharged from the nerves into the\r\nmuscles, or in the contrary direction, and that to effect this\r\ndischarge it would take the path of least resistance through\r\nthe metal conductor or through the human body. Since during\r\nthis discharge the muscle was caused to contract, Galvani\r\nconcluded that the purpose of this animal electricity was to\r\nproduce muscular contractions.\r\n\r\nGalvani seems to have concerned himself principally with the\r\nphysiological processes which he believed gave rise to the\r\nelectric charges, but physicists began immediately to seek for\r\nother sources of the electricity. The one observation which\r\nseemed to offer a definite suggestion as to the possible source\r\nof the electrical charge was the fact that, in general two\r\ndifferent metals must be used to connect the muscle and nerve\r\nbefore a discharge would take place from the one to the other.\r\nThis made Galvani's theory that the metals served merely as\r\nconductors seem improbable. On the other hand, it was sometimes\r\npossible to get the muscular contractions by using a single\r\nbent wire or rod to connect the nerve and muscle, especially if\r\nthe two ends were of different degrees of polish, or if one end\r\nwas warmer than the other.\r\n\r\nVolta was apparently the first to suggest that the electricity\r\nwhich seemed to be generated in Galvani's experiments might\r\nhave its source in the contact of the two metals. Several\r\nwriters called attention to an apparent relation between\r\nGalvani's experiments and a phenomenon announced by J. G.\r\nSulzer, in 1760. Sulzer found that if pieces of lead and silver\r\nwere placed upon the tongue separately no marked taste was\r\nproduced by either, but that if while both were on the tongue\r\nthe metals were brought into contact a strong taste was\r\nproduced which he compared to the taste of iron vitriol. Here\r\nwas a case of undoubted stimulation of the nerves of taste by\r\nthe contact of two metals, and it seemed not improbable that\r\nother nerves might be stimulated in the same manner. In the\r\nmeantime Mr. John Robison had increased the Sulzer effect\r\ngreatly by building up a pile of pieces of zinc with silver\r\nshillings and placing these in contact with the tongue and the\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nIt was the question as to the possibility of producing the\r\nelectric charge by mere metallic contact which led Cavallo to\r\nmake his experiments upon contact electrification. Thus Cavallo\r\nsays in Volume III. of \"A Complete Treatise on Electricity,\"\r\npublished in 1795:\r\n\r\n'The above mentioned singular properties, together with some\r\nother facts, which will be mentioned in the sequel induced Mr.\r\nVolta, to suspect that possibly in many cases the motions are\r\noccasioned by a small quantity of electricity produced by the\r\nmere contact of two different metals; though he acknowledges\r\nthat he by no means comprehends in what manner this can happen.\r\nThis suspicion being entertained by so eminent a philosopher as\r\nMr. Volta, induced Dr. Lind and myself to attempt some\r\nexperiment which might verify it; and with this in view we\r\nconnected together a variety of metallic substances in diverse\r\nquantities, and that by means of insulated or not insulated\r\ncommunications; we used Mr Volta's condenser, and likewise a\r\ncondenser of a new sort; the electrometer employed was of the\r\nmost sensible sort; and various other contrivances were used,\r\nwhich it will be needless to describe in this place; but we\r\ncould never obtain the smallest appearance of electricity from\r\nthose metallic combinations. Yet we can infer to no other\r\nconclusion, but that if the mere combination, or contact, of\r\nthe two metals produces any electricity, the quantity of it in\r\nour experiments was too small to he manifested by our\r\ninstruments.'\r\n\r\nLater, on page 111 of the same volume, he says:\r\n\r\n'After many fruitless attempts, and after having sent to the\r\npress the preceding part of this volume, I at last hit upon a\r\nmethod of producing electricity by the action of metallic\r\nsubstances upon one another, and apparently without the\r\ninterference of electric bodies. I say apparently so, because\r\nthe air seems to be in a great measure concerned in those\r\nexperiments, and perhaps the whole effect may be produced by\r\nthat surrounding medium. But, though the irregular,\r\ncontradictory, and unaccountable effects observed in these\r\nexperiments do not as yet furnish any satisfactory theory, and\r\nthough much is to be attributed to the circumambient air, yet\r\nthe metallic substances themselves seem to be endowed with\r\nproperties peculiar to each of them, and it is principally in\r\nconsequence of those properties that the produced electricity\r\nis sometimes positive, at other times negative, and various in\r\nits intensity.'\r\n\r\nCavallo then proceeds to describe the experiments on contact\r\nelectrification which were described in the previous paper\r\nreferred to at the beginning of the article.\r\n\r\nCavallo's experiments were evidently made in 1795. In the\r\nfollowing year Volta announced the discovery of the electrical\r\ncurrent. In a letter written to Gren's Neues Journal der\r\nPhysik, August, 1796, Volta says:\r\n\r\n'The contact of different conductors, particularly the\r\nmetallic, including pyrites and other minerals as well as\r\ncharcoal, which I call dry conductors, or of the first class\r\nwith moist conductors, or conductors of the second class,\r\nagitates or disturbs the electric fluid, or gives it a certain\r\nimpulse. Do not ask in what manner: it is enough that it is a\r\nprinciple and a great principle.'\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that at this stage of his discovery Volta was\r\ninclined to attribute tho origin of the current to the contact\r\nbetween the metals and his moist \"conductors of the second\r\nclass,\" though later in the same article he says it is\r\nimpossible to tell whether the impulse which sets the current\r\nin motion is to be attributed to the contact between the metals\r\nthemselves or between the two metals and the moist conductor,\r\nsince either supposition would lead to the same results.\r\n\r\nLater, as was shown in the previous paper by the present writer\r\nVolta came to regard the metallic contact as the cause of the\r\nelectromotive force. In a letter written to Gren in 1797 and\r\npublished as a postscript to his letter of August, 1796, Volta\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n'Some new facts, lately discovered, seem to show that the\r\nimmediate cause which excites the electric fluid, and puts it\r\nin motion, whether it be an attraction or a repulsive power, is\r\nto be ascribed much rather to the mutual contact of two\r\ndifferent metals, than to their contact with moist conductors.'\r\n\r\nThe new facts, \"lately discovered,\" to which Volta attributes\r\nhis change of view were his repetitions of Bennett's\r\nexperiments of 1789.\r\n\r\nVolta apparently thought that the current was not only set up\r\nby the contact of the two metals of a pair, but that it was\r\nkept up by the mutual action of the metals on each other. He\r\naccordingly made no attempt to discover whether any changes\r\ntook place in his circuit while the current was being\r\ngenerated. The chemical action on his metals and the\r\ndissociation in his electrolyte seem to have entirely escaped\r\nhis attention. At least, he did not attach enough importance to\r\nthem to mention them anywhere in his description of his\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a chemical explanation of the phenomena\r\nobserved by Galvani had been proposed in 1792 by Fabroni, a\r\nphysicist of Florence. After discussing the Sulzer phenomenon\r\nalready mentioned in this paper, Fabroni argues that the\r\npeculiar taste caused by bringing the two metals into contact\r\nwhile on the tongue is due to a chemical, rather than to an\r\nelectrical, action. He then discusses the different chemical\r\nbehavior of metals when taken singly and when placed in contact\r\nwith other metals. He says:[2]\r\n\r\n[2] The following quotations from Fabroni have been translated\r\nby the present writer from the German of Ostwald's\r\n\"Elektrochemie,\" pp. 103, ff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already frequently observed that fluid mercury retains\r\nits beautiful metallic luster for a long time when by itself;\r\nbut as soon as it is amalgamated with any other metal it\r\nbecomes rapidly dim or oxidized, and in consequence of its\r\ncontinuous oxidation increases in weight.\r\n\r\nI have preserved pure tin for many years without its changing\r\nits silvery luster, while different alloys of this metal which\r\nI have prepared for technical purposes have behaved quite\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nI have seen in the museum at Cortonne Etrusean inscriptions\r\nupon plates of pure lead which are perfectly preserved to this\r\nday' although they date from very ancient times; on the other\r\nhand, I have found with astonishment in the gallery of Florence\r\nthat the so-called \"piombi\" or leaden medallions of different\r\npopes, in which tin and possibly some arsenic have been mixed\r\nto make them harder and more beautiful, have fallen completely\r\nto white powder, or have changed to their oxides, though they\r\nwere wrapped in paper and preserved in drawers.\r\n\r\nIn the same way I have observed that the alloy which was used\r\nfor soldering the copper plates upon the movable roof of the\r\nobservatory at Florence has changed rapidly and in places of\r\ncontact with the copper plates has gone over into a white\r\noxide.\r\n\r\nI have heard also in England that the iron nails which were\r\nformerly used for fastening the copper plates of the sheathing\r\nof ships were attacked on account of contact, and that the\r\nholes became enlarged until they would slip over the heads of\r\nthe nails which held them in position.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this is sufficient to show that the metals\r\nin these cases exert a mutual influence upon each other, and\r\nthat to this must be ascribed the cause of the phenomena which\r\nthey show by their combination or contact.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing some of the experiments on nerve stimulation\r\nwhich had been made by Galvani and others, Fabroni argues that\r\nthese are principally, if not wholly, due to chemical action,\r\nand that the undoubted electrical phenomena which sometimes\r\naccompany them are not the cause of the muscular contractions.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the nature of the chemical changes produced in\r\ntwo metals by their mutual contact, Fabroni says:\r\n\r\n'Since the metals have relationships with each other, the\r\nmolecules must mutually attract each other as soon as they come\r\ninto contact. One can not determine the force of this\r\nattraction, but I believe it is sufficient to weaken their\r\ncohesion so that they become inclined to go into new\r\ncombinations and to more easily yield to the influence of the\r\nweakest solvents.'\r\n\r\nIn order to further show the weakening of cohesion by the\r\ncontact of two metals, Fabroni describes the results of some\r\nexperiments which he has made. He says:\r\n\r\n'In order to assure myself of the truth of my assumptions, I\r\nput into different vessels filled with water:\r\n\r\n(1) Separate pieces, for example, of gold in one, silver in\r\nanother, copper in the third, likewise tin, lead, etc.\r\n\r\n(2) In other similar vessels I put pieces of the same metals in\r\npairs, a more oxidizable and a less oxidizable metal in each\r\npair' but separated from each other by strips of glass\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, I put in other vessels pairs of different metals\r\nwhich were placed in immediate contact with each other.\r\n\r\nThe first two series suffered no marked change, while in the\r\nlatter series the more oxidizable metal became visibly covered\r\nwith oxide in a few instants after the contact was made.'\r\n\r\nFabroni found that under the above circumstances his oxidizable\r\nmetals dissolved in the water, and in some cases salts were\r\nformed which crystallized out. He then compares the metals in\r\ncontact with each other in water with the metals on the tongue\r\nwhen brought into contact, as in Sulzer's experiment, and the\r\ntwo metals touching each other by which different points on a\r\nnerve were touched to produce the muscular twitchings in\r\nGalvani's experiments, and concludes that the chemical action\r\nupon the metals was the same in each case, and that the other\r\nphenomena observed must have resulted from this chemical\r\naction. It is not strange that when Volta showed later that an\r\nelectric current passed between the metals in all of tho above\r\ncases Fabroni should regard the chemical action which he had\r\npreviously observed as the cause of this current.\r\n\r\nTen years after the publication of Fabroni's original paper,\r\nVolta wrote a letter to J. C. Delamethrie which was published\r\nin Vol. I of Nicholson's Journal. This letter was written after\r\nthe chemical changes in the voltaic cell had received a great\r\ndeal of attention by many experimenters, the most prominent of\r\nwhom was Davy. To show that Volta's theory as to the source of\r\nthe current was not affected by these investigations, a\r\nquotation from this letter is given below.\r\n\r\n'You have requested me to give you an account of the\r\nexperiments by which I demonstrate, in a convincing manner,\r\nwhat I have always maintained, namely, that the pretended\r\nagent, or GALVANIC FLUID, is nothing but common electrical\r\nFLUID, and that this fluid is incited and moved by the simple\r\nMUTUAL CONTACT OF DIFFERENT CONDUCTORS, particularly the\r\nmetallic; strewing that two metals of different kinds,\r\nconnected together, produce already a small quantity of true\r\nelectricity, the force and kind of which I have determined;\r\nthat the effects of my new apparatus (which might be termed\r\nelectromotors), whether consisting of a pile, or in a row of\r\nglasses, which have so much excited the attention of\r\nphilosophers, chemists, and physicians; that these so powerful\r\nand marvelous effects are absolutely no more than the sum total\r\nof the effects of a series of several similar metallic couples\r\nor pairs; and that the chemical phenomena themselves, which are\r\nobtained by them, of the decomposition of water and other\r\nliquids, the oxidation of metals, &c., are secondary effects;\r\neffects, I mean, of this electricity, of this continual current\r\nof electrical fluid, which by the above mentioned action of the\r\nconnected metals, establishes itself as soon as we form a\r\ncommunication between the two extremities of the apparatus, by\r\nmeans of a conducting bow; and when once established, maintains\r\nitself, and continues as long as the circuit remains\r\ninterrupted.'[3]\r\n\r\n[3] This seems to be a misprint for uninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther along in the same letter Volta reiterates his\r\nconviction that the contact of the two metals furnishes the\r\ntrue motive power of the current. Thus he says (p. 138):\r\n\r\n'As to the rest, the action which excites and gives motion to\r\nthe electric fluid does not exert itself, as has been\r\nerroneously thought, at the contact of the wet substance with\r\nthe metal, where it exerts so very small an action, that it may\r\nbe disregarded in comparison with that which takes place, as\r\nall my experiments prove, at the place of contact of different\r\nmetals with each other. Consequently the true element of my\r\nelectromotive apparatus, of the pile, of cups, and others that\r\nmay be constructed according to the same principles, is the\r\nsimple metallic couple, or pair, composed of two different\r\nmetals, and not a moist substance applied to a metallic one, or\r\ninclosed between two different metals, as most philosophers\r\nhave pretended. The humid strata employed in these complicated\r\napparatus are applied therefore for no other purpose than to\r\neffect a mutual communication between all the metallic pairs,\r\neach to each, ranged in such a manner as to impel the electric\r\nfluid in one direction, or in order to make them communicate,\r\nso that there may be no action in a direction contrary to the\r\nothers.'\r\n\r\nAt the end of the above letter as published in Nicholson's\r\nJournal, the editor, William Nicholson, comments at length on\r\nVolta's theory of the source of current in the cell and calls\r\nattention to the fact that Davy had already made cells by the\r\nuse of a single metal and two different liquids. At the\r\nconclusion of his comments he calls attention to the fact that\r\nBennett and Cavallo had performed experiments with contact\r\nelectrification prior to Volta's experiments, and says in\r\nconclusion, after referring to Bennett,\r\n\r\n'This last philosopher, as well as Cavallo, appears to think\r\nthat different bodies have different attractions or capacities\r\nfor electricity; but the singular hypothesis of electromotion,\r\nor a perpetual current of electricity being produced, by the\r\ncontact of two metals is, I apprehend, peculiar to Volta.'\r\n\r\nThis peculiar theory of Volta's probably never gained many\r\nadherents and was necessarily abandoned as soon as the energy\r\nrelations of the current were considered, but the controversy\r\nas to whether the electrical current or the accompanying\r\nchemical changes was the primary phenomenon soon became\r\ntransferred to a quite different field, viz., to the origin of\r\nthe electrical charges which Bennett had shown resulted from\r\nthe contact of different metals. Bennett attempted to account\r\nfor the phenomena which he had observed on the hypothesis that\r\ndifferent substances \"have a greater or less affinity with the\r\nelectric fluid,\" and Cavallo says:\r\n\r\n'I am inclined to suspect that different bodies have different\r\ncapacities for holding the electric fluid.'\r\n\r\nVolta reaches a similar conclusion after repeating some of\r\nBennett's experiments. In referring to this decision of Volta\r\nas to the origin of the electric charge in contact\r\nelectrification, Ostwald says:\r\n\r\n'We stand here at a point where the most prolific error of\r\nElectrochemistry begins, the combating of which has from that\r\ntime on occupied almost the greater part of the scientific work\r\nin this field.'\r\n\r\nThe error, from Ostwald's point of view, lies in the assumption\r\nthat the transference of electricity from the one metal to the\r\nother is a primary phenomenon of metallic contact. He, with\r\nmany others, including some of the most distinguished\r\nphysicists and chemists of the past century, regard the\r\nelectrical transference as a secondary phenomenon resulting\r\nfrom the previous oxidation of one of the metals. Thus Lodge,\r\nin discussing the opposite electrification of plates of zinc\r\nand copper when brought into contact says:\r\n\r\n'The effective cause of the whole phenomenon in either case is\r\nthe greater affinity of oxygen for zinc rather than copper.'\r\n\r\nThe apparent conflict of opinion between those who hold that\r\nthe different affinities of the metals for oxygen is the cause\r\nof the rearrangement of their electrical charges when brought\r\ninto contact and those who hold with Bennett and Cavallo that\r\nthe metals in their natural state have different affinities for\r\nthe electrical fluid must disappear when we recognize that all\r\naffinity, and consequently the affinity for oxygen, must be an\r\nelectrical attraction. If zinc has an affinity for oxygen, it\r\nmust be because the zinc is either electropositive or\r\nelectronegative to oxygen. If it has a greater affinity for\r\noxygen than copper has, then the zinc must be either\r\nelectropositive or electronegative to copper. This being the\r\ncase, and both being conductors, it is not surprising that some\r\nelectricity will flow from one to the other when the two metals\r\nare brought into contact.\r\n\r\nThose writers who attribute the oxidation theory of contact\r\nelectrification to Fabroni apparently overlook the fact that\r\nnot oxidation, but the weakening of the cohesion of at least\r\none of the metals due to their contact, was the primary\r\nphenomenon in Fabroni's theory. When this is remembered, it is\r\nseen that the observations of Bennett and Fabroni, instead of\r\nfurnishing arguments for two conflicting theories, actually\r\nserve, as all true scientific observations must, to supplement\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThus we now know that cohesion or affinity is an electrical\r\nattraction between the atoms or molecules of a body. The only\r\nknown methods of changing the electrical attraction between two\r\nbodies whose distances and directions from other bodies remain\r\nconstant is by varying the magnitude of their charges or by\r\nchanging the specific inductive capacity of the medium between\r\nthem. Bennett observed that when two pieces of different metal\r\nin their normal electrical condition are placed in contact,\r\nthere is a redistribution of the charges of their surface\r\natoms. Fabroni observed under the same conditions a change in\r\nthe surface cohesion of the two metals.\r\n\r\nTo the present writer this seems the actual sequence of\r\nphenomena, viz., a redistribution of the charges of the surface\r\natoms of the metals, a consequent change in surface cohesion\r\nand a resultant oxidation of one of the metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON CERTAIN RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN THE EARTH AND A BUTTERNUT\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR A, C. LANE\r\n\r\nTUFTS COLLEGE\r\n\r\nTHE drama of the earth's history consists in the struggle\r\nbetween the forces of uplift and the forces of degradation. The\r\nforces of uplift are mainly the outward expression of the inner\r\nenergy and heat of the earth, whether they be the volcano\r\nbelching its ashes thousands of meters into the air, or the\r\nearthquake, with the attendant crack or fault in the earth's\r\ncrust, leading to a sudden displacement, and sending, far and\r\nwide, a death-dealing shock, or those mountain-building\r\nactions, which, though they may be as gentle and gradual as\r\nmight be produced by the breathing of mother earth and the\r\nuplifting of her bosom thereby, nevertheless, end in the huge\r\nfolds of our mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nAgainst these, there are always working the forces of\r\ndegradation--the slow rotting of weathering caused by the\r\ndirect chemical action of the moist atmosphere or the\r\nalternation of hot and cold which crumbles rocks far above the\r\nline where rain never falls. Once the rock is rotten and\r\ndecayed, it yields readily to the forces of degradation, which\r\ndrag it down--the beating of the rain, the rush of the\r\navalanche or of the landslide, the tumult of the torrent, the\r\nquieter action of the muddy river in its lower reaches or the\r\nmighty glacier which transfers fine and coarse material alike\r\ntoward the sea.\r\n\r\nThese actions are always going on. Are they always equally\r\nbalanced, or are there periods when the forces of elevation are\r\nmore active, the forces of degradation not so powerful, as\r\nagainst other times in which the forces of degradation alone\r\nare at work? If there is inequality in the balance and struggle\r\nof these contending forces, the great periods or acts in the\r\ngeologic drama might thus be marked off as Chamberlin suggests.\r\nNewbery, Schuchert and others have pointed out that there seem\r\nto have been great cycles of sedimentation which may be\r\ninterpreted as due to the alternate success, first of the\r\nfactors of elevation, then of those of degradation.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, that there has been an epoch of\r\nelevation, that mountain chains have been lifted far into the\r\nsky and volcanoes have sent their floods of lava forth, and\r\nfault-scarped cliffs run across the landscape and that then,\r\nfor a while, the forces of elevation cease their work. Little\r\nby little, the mountains will be worn down to a surface of less\r\nand less relief, approaching a plain as a hyperbola approaches\r\nits asymptote--a surface which W. M. Davis has called\r\npeneplain.\r\n\r\nBut where will the material thus worn go? Into the sea. Going\r\ninto the ocean it will raise the level of the sea slowly but\r\nsurely. At present, for every four feet of elevation taken off\r\nthe land, there will be something like one foot rise of the\r\nocean level, and this rise may take only thirty thousand\r\nyears--a long time in human history, but not so long in the\r\nhistory of the earth. All the time, then, that the forces of\r\nthe atmosphere are wearing down the surface of the earth to the\r\nsea level the sea is rising and its waves are producing a plain\r\nof marine denudation which rises slowly to meet the peneplain\r\nwhich is produced by degradation. In the beginning of this\r\ncycle, where the forces of degradation have their own way,\r\ncoarse material may be brought down by torrents from the\r\nmountains, and the glaciers, which find their breeding place in\r\nthese high elevations, may drag down and deposit huge masses of\r\nboulder clay. But, little by little as the mountains are\r\nlowered, the sediments derived from them will become finer and\r\nfiner and glaciers will find fewer and fewer sources.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but the growth of seas extending over the\r\ncontinents will tend to change the climate, we shall have a\r\nmoister, more insular climate, we shall have a greater surface\r\nof evaporation, and thus, on the whole, a more equable\r\ntemperature throughout the world. We know that, at present, the\r\nextremes of cold and hot are found far within the interior of\r\nthe continents. Continental climates are the climates of\r\nextremes, and on the whole extremes are hurtful to life. So\r\nthen as the forces of degradation tend to lower the continents\r\nbeneath the sea level glaciers and deserts and desert deposits\r\nalike must also disappear. Vegetation will clothe the earth,\r\nand marine life swarm in the shallow seas of the broadening\r\ncontinental shelf. Under the mantle of vegetation, mechanical\r\nerosion will be less, that is, the breaking up of rocks into\r\nsmall pieces without any very great change, but the rich soil\r\nwill be charged with carbon dioxide, and chemical activity will\r\nstill go on. Rivers will still contain carbonates, even though\r\nthey carry very little mud, and in the oceans the corals and\r\nsimilar living forms will deposit the burden of lime brought\r\ninto the sea by the rivers. Thus, if forces of degradation have\r\ntheir own way, in time there will be a gradual change in\r\ndominant character, from coarse sediments to fine, from rocks\r\nwhich are simply crumbled debris to rocks that are the product\r\nof chemical decay and sorting, so that we have the lime\r\ndeposited as limestone in one place and the alumina and silica,\r\nin another. We shall have a change from local deposits, marine\r\non the edges of large continents, or land deposits, very often\r\ncoarse, with fossils few and far between, to rocks in which\r\nmarine deposits will spread far over the present land in which\r\nwill appear more traces of that life that crowded in the\r\nshallow warm seas which form on the flooded continents. We\r\nshall have a transition from deposits which may be largely\r\nformed on the surface of the continents. lakes, rivers, salt\r\nbeds and gypsum beds, due to the drying up of such lakes and\r\nthe wind-blown deposits of the steppes, to deposits which are\r\nalmost wholly marine.\r\n\r\nNow, I need not say (to those who are familiar with geology)\r\nthat we have indications of just such alternations in times\r\npassed. There are limestones abounding in fossils, with a\r\ncosmopolitan life very wide spread to be recognized in every\r\ncontinent, such as used to be known as the Trenton limestone,\r\nthe mountain limestone, the chalk. Perhaps every proper system\r\nand period should be marked by such a limestone in the middle.\r\nThe time classed as late Permian and Triassic on the other hand\r\nwas one of uplift, disturbance, volcanic action and extreme\r\nclimates, which gave us the traps of Mt. Tom, the Palisades of\r\nthe Hudson, the bold scenery of the Bay of Fundy and the gypsum\r\nand red beds which are generally supposed to be quite largely\r\nformed beneath the air and beds of tillite formed beneath\r\nglaciers. Then in the times succeeding, in many parts of the\r\nworld, degrading forces were more effective than uplifting so\r\nthat the mountains became lower, and the seas extended farther\r\nover the continents. Then the prevalence of lime sediments was\r\nso great that the \"chalk\" was thought to be characteristic\r\neverywhere. And about the time the \"chalk\" the land was reduced\r\nto a peneplain. A similar cycle may be traced from the\r\nKeweenawan rocks to the group of limestones so widespread over\r\nthe North American continent and so full of fossils, which to\r\nolder geologists and oil drillers have been known, in a broad\r\nway, as Trenton.\r\n\r\nAll this introduces a question--to which I wish to suggest an\r\nanswer--How is it that these cycles came to be? Were the outer\r\nrock crust of the earth perfectly smooth the oceans would cover\r\nit to the depths of thousands of feet and it is only by the\r\nwrinkling of such a crust that any part of it appears above the\r\nocean. If the earth had a cool thin crust upon a hot fluid\r\ninterior, and that thin crust were able to sustain itself\r\nduring geologic ages so that the shrinkage should accumulate\r\nwithin, until finally collapse came, giving an era of uplift,\r\nit is obvious that we could account for such cycles. There is\r\nvery clear evidence that the outermost layer of the earth's\r\ncrust is but a thin shell like the outer shuck or exocarp of a\r\nbutternut, so thin that it is not at all possible that it can\r\nsustain itself for more than a hundred miles or so, or for more\r\nthan a very few years at the outside. Hayford's[1]\r\ninvestigations are the latest that show that the continents\r\nproject because, on the whole, they are lighter, they float,\r\nthat is, above the level of the oceans because there is a mass\r\nof lighter rock below, like an iceberg in the sea. Here the\r\nlikeness between nut and earth fails and it would be more like\r\nthe earth if the outer shuck were thicker in certain large\r\nareas. If this extra lightness or \"isostatic compensation\" is\r\nequally distributed, Hayford finds[2] that the most probable\r\nvalue of the limiting depth is 70 (113 km.) miles, and\r\npractically certain that it is somewhere between 50 (80 km.)\r\nand 100 (150 km.) miles; if, on the other hand, this\r\ncompensation is uniformly distributed through a stratum 10 (16\r\nkm.) miles thick at the bottom of the crust so that there is a\r\nbulging of the crust down into a heavier layer below to balance\r\nthe projection of the mountains above, as I think much more\r\nlikely, then the most probable depth for the bottom of the\r\nouter layer is 37 (60 km.) miles. This layer is much thinner\r\nthan the outer layer of the figure and is supposed to yield to\r\nweight placed as, though more slowly than, new thin ice bends\r\nbeneath the skater.\r\n\r\n[1] The figure of the earth and isostasy from measurements in\r\nthe U.S. Dept. of Commerce and Labor, 1909, p. 175.\r\n\r\n[2] loc. cit., p. 175.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a number of facts which support this so-called theory\r\nof isostasy, according to which the crust of the earth is not\r\ncapable of sustaining any very great weight, though it may be\r\nat the outside rigid, but is itself essentially like a flexible\r\nmembrane resting on a layer of viscous fluid. However viscous\r\nthis fluid may be and rigid to transitory quickly shifting\r\nstrains like those produced by the earth's rotation, it does\r\nNOT REMAIN AT REST in a state of strain (at any rate if this\r\nstrain passes limits which are relatively quite low). Not only\r\nare, according to Hayford's observations, the inequalities of\r\nthe North American continent compensated for by lighter\r\nmaterial below, so that the plumb- bob deflections are only one\r\ntwentieth what they would be if they rested upon a rigid\r\nsubstratum of uniform density, but other facts that lead to the\r\nsame conclusion are the apparent tendency of areas of\r\nsedimentation to slowly settle under their load, the apparent\r\nsettling of the Great Lake region under a load of ice and\r\nspringing up again since the removal of the ice. But if the\r\ntheory of isostasy is true, one would at first say that there\r\ncould be no great accumulation through a geologic period of\r\nstresses which would finally yield in the shape of folded\r\nmountain ranges. It has, in fact, been suggested that mountain\r\nranges have been slowly folded and lifted as the stress which\r\nproduced them accumulated and this would seem to be true if one\r\nconsiders only the outer crust, but on the other hand, as we\r\nhave pointed out, there are indications in the history of the\r\nearth of periods of relative quiescence followed by periods of\r\nrelatively considerable disturbance.\r\n\r\nHow can these two theories be reconciled in accordance with\r\nwhat we know of the laws of physics and chemistry and those of\r\nthe earth's interior? It seems to me they can by making\r\nsuppositions which are perfectly natural regarding the state of\r\nthe earth's interior.\r\n\r\nWe are at liberty to suppose if the facts point that way that\r\nthere are the following layers in the earth's masses:--First,\r\nthe external, rigid and brittle layer; second, a layer under\r\nsuch temperature and pressure that it is above its plastic\r\nyield point and may be considered as a viscous fluid. The\r\npressure must continue to increase toward the center. We do not\r\nknow what is the temperature, but it is perfectly possible that\r\nat a greater depth the earth may become rigid once more if the\r\neffect of pressure in promoting solidity and rigidity\r\ncontinues, as Bridgman tells me he thinks probable. We do not\r\neven have to assume a change in the chemical composition of the\r\nearth's substance, though it is perfectly allowable. This,\r\nthen, will be a third layer, once more rigid, perhaps extending\r\nto the center and of very considerable thickness and capable of\r\naccumulating strain from long periods. Blanketed as it would be\r\nby thousands of meters of the first two layers, any change must\r\nbe relatively slow.\r\n\r\nKelvin in his computation of the age of the earth from cooling\r\nassumed for the interior of the earth constant conditions. It\r\nis now generally accepted that this is not probable, and that\r\nwhether it cooled from a gas or coagulated from planetesimals,\r\nit became solid first at the center which then would be\r\nhottest, and both Becker[3] and A. Holmes[4] assume an initial\r\ntemperature gradient. If that gradient were greater than the\r\ngradient of steady flow the conditions of steady flow would be\r\napproached most rapidly at the exterior, the loss of heat and\r\nenergy would be altogether from within and it is easy to\r\narrange for conditions mathematically in which almost all the\r\nloss of energy would come from the very interior, near the\r\ncenter. What will be the effect? A paradoxical one, if the part\r\noutside the center is rigid enough to be self-sustaining. The\r\ncentral core will become a gas!\r\n\r\n[3] Bull. Geol. Soc. Am., Vol. 26, 1915, p. 197, etc.\r\n[4] Geological Magazine, March and April, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is so contrary to our ordinary experience and ideas, in\r\nwhich loss of heat tends to change from gas to fluid and solid,\r\nthat we must look into it a little to make it sound reasonable.\r\nThe recent brilliant work of P. W. Bridgman (contrary to the\r\nearlier speculations of Tammann) indicates that the effect of\r\nincreased pressure, at high temperature, makes a substance\r\nsolid and crystalline. Crowd any atoms close enough together,\r\nand no matter how fast they expand or contract under the\r\ninfluence of heat the crystalline atomic forces will get to\r\nwork when they are crowded within their range, and the closest\r\npacking, hence that which will yield most to the pressure,\r\nhence that which is likely to take place, is when they are all\r\nregularly arranged facing the same way. Such an arrangement we\r\ncall crystalline. Just so when they want to pack the most\r\npeople into the car of an elevator they ask them to all face to\r\nthe front. Keep this metaphor a moment. Any one who should try\r\nto penetrate such a crowd would find it a hard job. They would\r\noffer a very effective rigidity. Now suppose them to sweat in\r\nthose confined quarters their fat away, their phlogiston, their\r\ncaloric. If the walls of the car remained rigid while the\r\nindividuals therein shrunk they might after a while be able to\r\nturn around or even move around in a car. Such is then the\r\nsupposed condition of the atoms in the FOURTH, the central,\r\nlayer of the earth's crust. This assumes that the middle layer\r\nis rigid and sustains itself, like the shell of a nut, as in\r\nthe figure, while within the atoms are in a less rigid\r\ncondition. That such a shell might be self-sustaining is\r\nsuggested by an experiment of Bridgman, who put a marble with a\r\ngas bubble in it under a pressure of something like 150,000\r\npounds to the square inch without producing any perceptible\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nAs loss of energy from the earth's interior went on this\r\ncentral core of gas would enlarge until the middle shell was\r\nhardly self-supporting. Then, probably at some time of\r\nastronomic strain when the earth's, orbit was extra elliptical,\r\nit would collapse, in collapsing generate heat, and so stop the\r\nprocess. The collapse would be transmitted to the viscous layer\r\nwhich might be increased, motions set up in it, and so a\r\nwrinkling of the outer thin crust on which we live.\r\n\r\nThen there would be four layers to the earth like the butternut\r\nof the figure. First, the inner kernel of gas; second, the hard\r\nshell or endocarp; third, a viscous layer like the sarcocarp or\r\npulp, and outside of all the wrinkled crust of exocarp. If such\r\nis the structure of the earth we may have in the very structure\r\nof the earth itself a reason why from time to time there are\r\ncollapses of the middle layer leading to elevations of portions\r\nof the outer rind, and marking off the chapters in geological\r\nhistory, the lines between geological systems.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons in facts of observation for believing that\r\nsuch is the structure of the earth, of which I have as yet said\r\nnothing. We see the interior of a glass marble, I saw the\r\nbubble in the interior of Bridgman's glass marble, how? By\r\nwaves, vibrations, which start from the sun or some other\r\nsource, and going through it reach my eye. Though the earth is\r\nnot penetrated by sunlight it is penetrated by the waves and\r\nvibrations that start from that jar produced by a crack which\r\nwe call an earthquake. These vibrations can be received by that\r\neye of the geologist called a seismograph. The seismologist\r\ntells us there are three kinds of waves sent out in an\r\nearthquake. If you notice the explosion of a blast at a little\r\ntoo close distance you will notice that you see it first, then\r\nhear it, and then perhaps a little later a few chips of rock\r\nmay come flying past your ears. These three things correspond\r\nsomewhat to the three kinds of waves which spread forth from an\r\nearthquake. But in the case of the explosion we see the blast\r\nfirst, then hear later. The waves which produce the sensation\r\nof sight are, we know, lateral disturbances, the waves which\r\nproduce the sensation of sound are waves of condensation, whose\r\nmotion is in the direction of their propagation and they come\r\nlater. In the case of the jars of earth, the reverse is true.\r\nThe first set of waves to arrive are the waves which are due to\r\ncompression--vibrations in the direction in which the waves are\r\nproduced--and correspond to sound waves. Later come waves which\r\nare transverse sidewise disturbances of the solid mass of the\r\nearth. As we can easily see, in an earthquake jar traveling\r\nfrom the opposite end of the earth, there should be no\r\ninsurmountable difficulty in recognizing the jar, which is a\r\ndirect upthrow from one which would tilt it to the right or\r\nleft. Now there is a law of Laplace by which the velocity of\r\nspread of sound waves through gas may be calculated. That this\r\nlaw should hold at temperatures and pressures so high as those\r\nthat must exist in the middle of the earth is, of course, a\r\nquestion, but it will be interesting to see how nearly the\r\nactual velocity of about 10 kilometers a second compares with\r\nthe velocity which such waves should have in gas of a density\r\nand under a pressure such as a gas near the center of the earth\r\nmust have. Using Oldham's figures (and they seem to be\r\nconfirmed by the recent investigations of E. Rudolph and S.\r\nSzirtes[18]), we find that the time of transmission of these\r\nfirst and fastest preliminary compression tremors is about\r\ntwice the velocity of such a jar according to Laplace's law in\r\nas dense a mass of gas, provided the ratio of the specific heat\r\nof a gas at constant pressure to that of a gas at constant\r\nvolume remains 1.4, which is for many substances. But as it is\r\n1.6 for mercury the discrepancy is not more than I had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n[5] Gerlands, \"Beitrage zur Geophysik,\" XI., Band, 1 Heft,\r\n1911, p. 132. \"Das kolumbianische Erdbeben am 31 January,\r\n1906.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second preliminary tremors arriving later are due to the\r\nlateral disturbance. Their propagation is much less rapid when\r\nthe point of origin is nearly opposite the point of receival.\r\nIn other words there is a core within the earth about 0.4 of\r\nthe radius in radius, in which according to Oldham, these\r\nlateral waves have much less velocity. Now in a gas there is\r\nless resistance to lateral displacement than in a solid, and\r\nthe less the resistance the less the velocity, so that this\r\nfact fits in with the idea of a gaseous core perfectly. If\r\nthere is such n core, moreover, of less rigidity it would have\r\nless refraction. Consequently waves not striking the border\r\nabove the angle of total reflection would be totally reflected,\r\nand just as around a bubble there is a dark border where the\r\nlight does not get through so at a certain distance from the\r\nsource of an earthquake there would be a circle (it is really\r\nabout 140 degrees of arc away), where no second tremors would\r\nbe felt. Here again, though seismograph stations are as yet\r\nfew, fact and theory are apparently going to correspond.\r\n\r\nThe last type of earthquake waves follow around the outer layer\r\nof the crust.\r\n\r\nThere is one farther line of verification to which I had\r\naddressed myself. Is it likely that the loss of heat and energy\r\nfrom the central nucleus, at the rate which we know at the\r\nsurface from a central nucleus of anything like 0.4 the radius\r\nof the earth, would give a shrinkage of anything like the\r\namount indicated by the mountain ranges, in anything like the\r\ntime which we are led to assign on other grounds to the\r\ngeologic periods?\r\n\r\nRudski has also attempted to connect the shrinkage and age of\r\nthe earth. Both these methods depend on how fast the earth is\r\nlosing heat, that is on the geothermal gradient. Since at\r\npresent, owing to the apparently large but unknown contribution\r\nof radioactivity to that gradient we know very little about\r\nwhat the other portion is, it seems unwise to give any figures,\r\nespecially as almost all the numerical data are largely guess\r\nwork. It will, however, be fair to say that very long times for\r\nthe age of the earth seem to be indicated, nearer millions of\r\nmillions than millions unless the radius of the gaseous core\r\nwas mainly small or its rate of contraction with loss of\r\ntemperature high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASH VALUE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR T. BRAILSFORD ROBERTSON\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nTHERE can be no doubt that the average man and woman in Europe\r\nand America to-day professes a more or less nebulous feeling of\r\nrespect and admiration for the scientific investigator. This\r\nfeeling is not logical, for very few have ever met or seen a\r\nscientist, fewer still have ever seen the inside of a\r\nscientific laboratory, and hardly any have ever seen scientific\r\nresearch in the making.\r\n\r\nThe average man in the street or man of affairs has no very\r\nclear conception of what manner of man a \"scientist\" may be. No\r\nespecial significance attaches in his mind to the term. No\r\npicture of a personality or his work arises in the imagination\r\nwhen the word \"scientist\" is pronounced. More or less\r\nindefinitely, I suppose, it is conceded by all that a scientist\r\nis a man of vast erudition (an impression by the way which is\r\noften strikingly incorrect) who leads a dreary life with his\r\nhead buried in a book or his eye glued to telescope or\r\nmicroscope, or perfumed with those disagreeable odors which, as\r\neverybody knows, are inseparably associated with chemicals. The\r\npurpose of this life is not very clear, but doubtless a vague\r\nfeeling exists in the minds of most of us that people who are\r\nwilling to pursue such an unattractive career must be worthy of\r\nadmiration, for despite all the triumphs of commercialism,\r\nhumanity still loves idealism, even idealism which seems\r\nobjectless because it is incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the existence of the scientific man is\r\nrecalled to the popular mind by some extravagant headlines in\r\nthe daily press, announcing some utterly impossible \"discovery\"\r\nor some extravagantly nonsensical dictum made by an alleged\r\n\"scientist.\" The \"discovery\" was never made, the dictum never\r\nuttered, but no matter; to-morrow its place will be taken by\r\nthe latest political or matrimonial scandal, and the public,\r\nwith excellent good sense, will forget all about it.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, also, there creeps gradually into the public\r\nconsciousness a sense that SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED. Brief\r\nnotices appear in the press, at first infrequently and then\r\nmore frequently, and an article or two in the popular\r\nmonthlies. The public becomes languidly interested in a new\r\npossibility and even discusses it, sceptically. Then of a\r\nsudden we are awakened to the realization of a new power in\r\nbeing. The X-ray, wireless telegraphy or the aeroplane has\r\nbecome the latest \"marvel of science,\" only to develop in a\r\nvery brief period into a commonplace of existence.\r\n\r\nMany indeed are aware that we owe these \"marvels\" to scientific\r\nresearch, but very few indeed, to the shame of our schools be\r\nit spoken, have attained to the faintest realization of the\r\nindubitable fact that we owe almost the entirety of our\r\nmaterial environment, and no small proportion of our social and\r\nspiritual environment, to the labors of scientists or of their\r\nspiritual brethren.\r\n\r\nLong ago, in ages so remote that no record of them survives\r\nsave our heritage of labor well achieved, some pastoral savage,\r\nmore reflective and less practical than his brethren, took to\r\nstar-gazing and noting in his memory certain strange\r\ncoincidences. Doubtless he was chidden by his tribal leaders\r\nwho were hard-headed men of affairs, skilled in the\r\nquestionable art of imposing conventional behavior upon unruly\r\ntribesmen. But he was an inveterate dreamer, this prehistoric\r\nNewton and the fascination of the thing had gripped his mind.\r\nIn due time he was gathered to his fathers, but not before he\r\nhad passed on to a few chosen ones the peculiar coincidences he\r\nhad observed. And thus, from age to age coincidence was added\r\nto coincidence and the result of all this \"unpractical\" labor\r\nwas, at long last, a calendar. Let who will attempt to estimate\r\nthe cash value of this discovery; I will not attempt the\r\nimpossible. I will merely ask you to picture to yourselves\r\nhumanity in the condition of the Australian Aboriginal or of\r\nthe South African Bushman; devoid of any means of estimating\r\ntime or season save by the daily passage of the sun, and I ask\r\nyou, \"supposing that through some vast calamity, a calamity\r\ngreater even than the present war, humanity could at a stroke\r\nevolve a calendar, would it be worth while?\" I for one think it\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the calendar is not an inapt illustration of\r\nthe methods of science, and of the part which it has played in\r\nshaping the destiny of man. Out of the unregarded labors of\r\nthousands of forgotten men, and a few whom we now remember, has\r\nsprung every detail of that vast complex of machinery, method\r\nand measurement in which to-day we live and move and have our\r\nbeing. In all ages scientific curiosity guided by the\r\nscientific discipline of thought has forced man into new and\r\nmore complex paths of progress. Lacking the spirit of research,\r\na nation or community is merely parasitic, living upon the\r\nvital achievements of others, as Rome based her civilization\r\nupon the civilization of the Greeks. Only an indefinite and\r\nsterile refinement of the existing environment is possible\r\nunder such circumstances, and humanity stays stationary or\r\nsinks back into the semibarbarism of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nThe few scattered students of nature of that day picked up the\r\nclue to her secrets exactly as it fell from the hands of the\r\nGreeks a thousand years before. The foundations of mathematics\r\nwere so well laid by them that our children learn their\r\ngeometry from a book written for the schools of Alexandria two\r\nthousand years ago. Modern astronomy is the natural\r\ncontinuation and development of the work of Hipparchus and of\r\nPtolemy; modern physics of that of Democritus and of\r\nArchimedes; it was long before biological science outgrew the\r\nknowledge bequeathed to us by Aristotle, by Theophrastus and by\r\nGalen.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] T. H. Huxley, \"Science and Culture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we ask ourselves what has been the value of\r\nscience to man, the answer is that its value is practically the\r\nvalue of the whole world in which we find ourselves to-day, or,\r\nat any rate, the difference between the value of our world and\r\nthat of a world inhabited by Neolithic savages.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping nature of this deduction may from its very\r\ncomprehensiveness fail to carry conviction to the reader. But\r\nconcrete illustrations of the value which scientific research\r\nmay add to our environment are not far to seek. They are\r\nafforded in abundance by the dramatic achievements of the past\r\ncentury of human progress, in which science has begun painfully\r\nand haltingly to creep into its true place and achieve its true\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1813 many important events occurred. The power of\r\nNapoleon was crumbling in that year and countless historians\r\nhave written countless pages describing innumerable events,\r\ngreat and small, which accompanied that colossal downfall. But\r\none event of that year, of which we do not read in our\r\nhistorical memoirs and school books was the discovery by Sir\r\nHumphry Davy, in the humble person of a bookbinder's\r\napprentice, of the man who will probably stand out forever in\r\nthe history of science as the ideal scientific man--Michael\r\nFaraday. The manner of this discovery is revealed by the\r\nfollowing conversation between Sir Humphry Davy and his friend\r\nPepys. \"Pepys, what am I to do, here is a letter from a young\r\nman named Faraday; he has been attending my lectures, and wants\r\nme to give him employment at the Royal Institution--what can I\r\ndo?\" \"Do?\" replied Pepys, \"put him to wash bottles; if he\r\nrefuses he is good for nothing.\" \"No, no,\" replied Davy; \"we\r\nmust try him with something better than that.\" The result was,\r\nthat Davy engaged him to assist in the laboratory at weekly\r\nwages.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] J. Tyndall, \"Faraday as a Discoverer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavy made many important discoveries, but none of his\r\ndiscoveries was more important than his discovery of Faraday,\r\nand of all the events which occurred in the year 1813, the\r\nentry of Faraday into the Royal Institution was not the least\r\nsignificant for humanity.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Christmas day, 1821, Faraday called his wife\r\ninto his laboratory to witness, for the first time in the\r\nhistory of man, the revolution of a magnet around an electric\r\ncurrent. The foundations of electromagnetics were laid and the\r\nedifice was built by Faraday upon this foundation in the\r\nfourteen succeeding years. In those years and from those\r\nlabors, the electro-motor, the motor generator, the electrical\r\nutilization of water power, the electric car, electric\r\nlighting, the telephone and telegraph, in short all that is\r\ncomprised in modern electrical machinery came actually or\r\npotentially into being. The little rotating magnet which\r\nFaraday showed his wife was, in fact, the first electric motor.\r\n\r\nWhat was the cash value to humanity of those fourteen years of\r\nlabor in a laboratory?\r\n\r\nAccording to the thirteenth census of the United States, the\r\nvalue of the electrical machinery, apparatus and supplies\r\nproduced in this country alone, in 1909 was $221,000,000. In\r\n1907, the value of the electric light and power stations in the\r\nUnited States was $1,097,000,000, of the telephones\r\n$820,000,000, and the combined income from these two sources\r\nwas $360,000,000. Nor does this represent a tithe of the\r\nvalues, as yet barely realized, which these researches placed\r\nat our disposal. Thus in its waterfalls, the United States is\r\nestimated to possess 150,000,000 available horse-power, which\r\ncan only be realized through the employment of Faraday's\r\nelectro-motor. This corresponds, at the conservative figure of\r\n$20 per horse-power per annum to a yearly income of\r\n$3,000,000,000, corresponding at 4 per cent. interest to a\r\ncapital value of $75,000,000,0000.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] M. T. Bogert, \"The Function of Chemistry in the\r\nConservation of our National Resources,\" Journal of the\r\nAmerican Chemical Society, February, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the Christmas gift which Michael Faraday presented to\r\nthe world in 1821.\r\n\r\nFaraday died a poor man in 1867, neither for lack of\r\nopportunity nor for lack of ability to grasp his opportunities,\r\nbut because as his pupil Tyndall tells us, he found it\r\nnecessary to choose between the pursuit of wealth and the\r\npursuit of science, and he deliberately chose the latter. This\r\nis not a bad thing. It is perhaps as it should be, and as it\r\nhas been in the vast majority of cases. But another fact which\r\ncan not be viewed with like equanimity is that of all the\r\ninexhaustible wealth which Faraday poured into the lap of the\r\nworld, not one millionth, not a discernible fraction, has ever\r\nbeen returned to science for the furtherance of its aims and\r\nits achievements, for the continuance of research.\r\n\r\nThere is no regular machinery for securing the permanent\r\nendowment of research, and it is always and everywhere a barely\r\ntolerated intruder. In the universities it crouches under the\r\nshadow of pedagogy, and snatches its time and its materials\r\nfrom the fragments which are left over when the all-important\r\nbusiness of teaching the young what others have accomplished\r\nhas been done. In commercial institutions it occasionally\r\npursues a stunted career, subject to all the caprices of\r\nmomentary commercial advantage and the cramped outlook of the\r\n\"practical man.\" The investigator in the employ of a commercial\r\nundertaking is encouraged to be original, it is true, but not\r\nto be too original. He must never transcend the \"practical,\"\r\nthat is to say, the infinitesimal rearrangement of the\r\npreexisting. The institutions existing in the world which are\r\ndevoted to research and, research alone can almost be counted\r\non the fingers. The Solvay Institute in Brussels, the Nobel\r\nInstitute in Stockholm, the Pasteur Institute in France, the\r\nInstitute for Experimental Therapy at Frankfort, The Kaiser\r\nWilhelm Institutes at Berlin, The Imperial Institute for\r\nMedical Research at Petrograd, the Biologisches Versuchsanstalt\r\nat Vienna, the Biological Station at Naples, the Royal\r\nInstitution in London, the Wellcome Laboratories in England and\r\nat Khartoum, the Smithsonian, Wistar, Carnegie and Rockefeller\r\nInstitutes in the United States; the list of research\r\ninstitutes of important dimensions (excluding astronomical\r\nobservatories) is, I believe, practically exhausted by the\r\nabove enumeration, and many of them are woefully undermanned\r\nand underequipped. At least two of them, the Solvay Institute\r\nwholly, and the Frankfort Institute for Experimental Therapy in\r\npart, owe their existence and continuance to scientific men,\r\nSolvay and Ehrlich, who have contrived to combine the pursuit\r\nof wealth and of science, and have dedicated the wealth thus\r\nprocured to the science that gave it birth.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the value of the manufacturing industries in the United\r\nStates which had been developed from patented scientific\r\ninventions was no less than $395,663,958 per annum,[4]\r\ncorresponding to a capital value of about $10,000,000,000. It\r\nis impossible to arrive at any accurate estimate of the\r\nproportion of this wealth which finds its way back to science\r\nto provide equipment and subsistence for the investigator, who\r\nis creating the wealth of the future. But the capital endowment\r\nof the Rockefeller and Carnegie Institutes, the two wealthiest\r\ninstitutes of research in the world is, according to the 1914\r\nissue of Minerva, only $29,000,000. The total income (exclusive\r\nof additions to endowments) of all the higher institutions of\r\nlearning in the United States in 1913, was only $90,000,000, of\r\nwhich a minute percentage was expended in research.\r\n\r\n[4] 12th census, Vol. 10, Part 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf science produces so much wealth, is there no contrivance\r\nwhereby we can cause a small fraction of this wealth to return\r\nautomatically to science and to furnish munitions of war for\r\nfresh conquests of nature? A very small investment in research\r\noften produces colossal returns. In 1911 the income of the\r\nKaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry was only\r\n$21,000. In 1913 the income of the Institute for Experimental\r\nTherapy at Frankfort, where \"606\" was discovered, was only\r\n$20,000; that of the Imperial Institute for Medical Research at\r\nPetrograd was $95,000, and that of the National Physical\r\nLaboratory in England (not exclusively devoted to research) was\r\n$40,000. Yet these are among the most famous research\r\ninstitutions in the world and have achieved results of\r\nworld-wide fame and inestimable value both from a financial\r\nstandpoint and from the standpoint of the physical, moral and\r\nspiritual welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, Perkin, an English chemist, discovered the coal-tar\r\n(anilin) dyes. The cost of this investigation, which was\r\ncarried out in an improvised, private laboratory was\r\nnegligible. Yet, in 1905, the United States imported $5,635,164\r\nworth of these dyes from Europe, and Germany exported\r\n$24,065,500 worth to all parts of the world.[5] To-day we read\r\nthat great industries in this country are paralyzed because\r\nthese dyes temporarily can not be imported from Germany. All of\r\nthese vast results sprang from a modest little laboratory, a\r\nmeager equipment and the genius and patience of one man.\r\n\r\n[5] U. S. Census Bureau Bull. 92.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. R. Whitney, director of the research laboratory of the\r\nGeneral Electric Company, points out that the collective\r\nimprovements in the manufacture of filaments for electric\r\nlamps, from 1901 to 1911, have saved the consumer and producer\r\nno less than $240,000,000 annually. He adds with apparently\r\nunconscious naivete that the expenses of the research\r\nlaboratory in his charge aggregate more than $100,000\r\nannually![6] A handsome investment, this, which brings in some\r\ntwo hundred million for an outlay of one hundred thousand.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Technology and Industrial Efficiency,\" McGraw-Hill Book\r\nCo., 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Huxley the discovery by Pasteur of the means of\r\npreventing or curing anthrax, silkworm disease and chicken\r\ncholera, a fraction of that great man's life work, added\r\nannually to the wealth of France a sum equivalent to the entire\r\nindemnity paid by France to Germany after the war of 1870.\r\n\r\nHumanity has not finished its conquest of nature; on the\r\ncontrary, it has barely begun. The discipline of thought which\r\nhas carried humanity so far is destined to carry it further\r\nyet. Business enterprise and politics, the all-absorbing\r\ninterests of the majority of mankind, work in an endless\r\ncircle. Scientific research communicates a thrust to this\r\nrotation which converts the circle into a spiral; the apex of\r\nthat spiral lies far beyond our vision. We have, not decades,\r\nnot centuries, not thousands of years before us; but, as\r\nastronomy assures us, in all probability, humanity has millions\r\nof years of earthly destiny to realize. Barely three thousand\r\nyears of PURPOSEFUL scientific research have brought the\r\nuttermost ends of the earth to our doors; have made\r\ncivilization and excluded much of the most brutal and\r\nbrutalizing in life. Not more than two hundred years of\r\nresearch have made us masters where we were slaves; masters of\r\ndistance, of the air, of the water, of the bowels of the earth,\r\nof many of the most dreaded aspects of disease and suffering.\r\nOnly for forty years have we practiced antisepsis; only for\r\nsixty years have we had anesthetics; yet life to-day is\r\nwell-nigh inconceivable without them. And all of this has been\r\naccomplished without any forethought on the part of the\r\nacknowledged rulers and leaders of mankind or any save the most\r\ntrumpery and uncertain provision for research. What will the\r\nmillions of years which stretch in front of us bring of power\r\nto mankind? We can barely foreshadow things too vast to grasp;\r\nthings that will make the imaginings of Jules Verne and H. G.\r\nWells seem puny by comparison. The future, with the uncanny\r\ncontrol which it will bring over things that seem to us almost\r\nsacred--over life and death and development and thought\r\nitself--might well seem to us a terrifying prospect were it not\r\nfor one great saving clause. Through all that may happen to\r\nman, of this we may be sure, that he will remain human; and\r\nbecause of that we can face the future unafraid and confident\r\nthat because it will be greater, it will also be better than\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do to accelerate the coming of this future? Not\r\nvery much, it is true, but we can surely do something. We can\r\nnot create geniuses, often we can not discern them, but having\r\ndiscerned, surely we can use them to the best advantage. It is\r\ntrue that all scientific research has depended and will depend\r\nupon individuals; Simon Newcomb expresses the matter thus:\r\n\r\n'It is impressive to think how few men we should have to remove\r\nfrom the earth during the past three centuries to have stopped\r\nthe advance of our civilization. In the seventeenth century\r\nthere would only have been Galileo, Newton and a few other\r\ncontemporaries, in the eighteenth they could almost have been\r\ncounted on the fingers, and they have not crowded the\r\nnineteenth.'[7]\r\n\r\n[7] \"Inventors at Work,\" Iles, Doubleday Page, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing we have to do is to discover such men, to learn\r\nto know them or suspect them when we meet them or their works.\r\nThe next is to give them moral and financial recognition, and\r\nthe means of doing their work. Our procedure in the past has\r\nbeen the reverse of this. I quote from a letter of Kepler to\r\nhis friend Moestlen:\r\n\r\n'I supplicate you, if there is a situation vacant at Tubingen,\r\ndo what you can to obtain it for me, and let me know the prices\r\nof bread, wine and other necessaries of life, for my wife is\r\nnot accustomed to live on beans.'\r\n\r\nThe founder of comparative psychology, J. H. Fabre, that\r\n\"incomparable observer\" as Darwin characterized him, is now\r\nover ninety years of age, and until very recently was actually\r\nsuffering from poverty. All his life his work was stunted and\r\ncrippled by poverty, and countless researches which he was the\r\none human being qualified by genius and experience to\r\nundertake, remain to this day unperformed because he never\r\ncould command the meager necessary equipment of apparatus.\r\n\r\nOnce again, what can we do?\r\n\r\nNo small proportion of the population of a modern community are\r\nalumni of some institution of higher learning, and one thing\r\nthat these can do is to see to it by every means in their power\r\nthat some measure of the spirit of academic freedom is\r\npreserved in their alma mater. That the spirit of inquiry and\r\nresearch is not merely tolerated therein but fostered and\r\nsubstantially supported, morally and financially.\r\n\r\nAs members of the body politic, we can assist the development\r\nof science in two ways. Firstly, by doing each our individual\r\npart towards ensuring that endowment for the university must\r\nprovide not only for \"teaching adolescents the rudiments of\r\nGreek and Latin\" and erecting imposing buildings, but also for\r\nthe furtherance of scientific research. The public readily\r\nappreciates a great educational mill for the manufacture of\r\nmediocre learning, and it always appreciates a showy building,\r\nbut it is slow to realize that that which urgently and at all\r\ntimes needs endowment is experimental research.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is vital that public sentiment should be educated\r\nto the point of providing the legal machinery whereby some\r\nproportion, no matter how small, of the wealth which science\r\npours into the lap of the community, shall return automatically\r\nto the support and expansion of scientific research. The\r\ncollection of a tax upon the profits accruing from inventions\r\n(which are all ultimately if indirectly results of scientific\r\nadvances) and the devotion of the proceeds from this tax to the\r\nfurtherance of research would not only be a policy of wisdom in\r\nthe most material sense, but it would also be a policy of bare\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICAL MICHELANGELO\r\n\r\nBY JAMES FREDERICK ROGERS, M.D.\r\n\r\nNEW HAVEN, CONN.\r\n\r\nYou will say that I am old and mad, but I answer that there is\r\nno better way of keeping sane and free from anxiety than by\r\nbeing mad.\r\n\r\nHAD Michelangelo been less poetic and more explicit in his\r\nlanguage, he might have said there is nothing so conducive to\r\nmental and physical wholeness as saturation of body and mind\r\nwith work. The great artist was so prone to over-anxiety and\r\nmet (whether needlessly or not) with so many rebuffs and\r\ndisappointments, that only constant absorption in manual labor\r\nprevented spirit from fretting itself free from flesh. He\r\ntoiled \"furiously\" in all his mighty undertakings and body and\r\nmind remained one and in superior harmony--in abundant\r\nhealth--for nearly four score and ten years.\r\n\r\nThis Titan got his start in life in the rugged country three\r\nmiles outside Florence: a place of quarries, where stone\r\ncutters and sculptors lived and worked. His mother's health was\r\nfailing and it was to the wife of one of these artisans that\r\nher baby was given to nurse. Half in jest, half in earnest,\r\nMichelangelo said one day to Vasari:\r\n\r\n'If I have anything good in me, that comes from my birth in the\r\npure air of your country of Arezzo, and perhaps also from the\r\nfeet that with the milk of my nurse, I sucked in the chisels\r\nand hammers wherewith I make my figures.'\r\n\r\n\r\nHe began his serious study of art (and with it his course in\r\n\"physical training\") at fourteen, when he became apprenticed to\r\na painter. He was not vigorous as a child, but his bodily\r\npowers unfolded and were intensified through their active\r\nexpression of his imagination.\r\n\r\nHis life was devoted with passion to art. He had from the start\r\nno time for frivolity. Art became his religion--and required of\r\nhim the sacrifice of all that might keep him below his highest\r\nlevel of power for work. His father early warned him to have a\r\ncare for his health, \"for,\" said he, \"in your profession, if\r\nonce you were to fall ill you would be a ruined man.\" To one so\r\nintent on perfection and so keenly alive to imperfection such\r\nadvice must have been nearly superfluous, for the artist could\r\nnot but observe the effect upon his work of any depression of\r\nhis bodily well-being. He was, besides, too thrifty in all\r\nrespects to think of lapsing into bodily neglect or abuse. He\r\nwas severely temperate, but not ascetic, save in those times\r\nwhen devotion to work caused him to sleep with his clothes on,\r\nthat he might not lose time in seizing the chisel when he\r\nawoke. He ate to live and to labor, and was pleased with a\r\npresent of \"fifteen marzolino cheeses and fourteen pounds of\r\nsausage--the latter very welcome, as was also the cheese.\" Over\r\na gift of choice wines he is not so enthusiastic and the\r\nbottles found their way mostly to the tables of his friends and\r\npatrons. When intent on some work he usually \"confined his diet\r\nto a piece of bread which he ate in the middle of his labors.\"\r\nFew hours (we have no accurate statement in the matter) were\r\ndevoted to sleep. He ate comparatively little because he worked\r\nbetter: he slept less than many men because he worked better in\r\nconsequence. Partly for protection against cold, partly perhaps\r\nfor economy of time, he sometimes left his high dog-skin boots\r\non for so long that when he removed them the scarf skin came\r\naway like the skin of a moulting serpent.\r\n\r\nHe dressed for comfort and not to mortify the flesh. Upon the\r\nreceipt of a present of some shirts from his nephew he writes:\r\n\r\n'I am very much surprised ye should have sent them to me, for\r\nthey are so coarse that there is not a farm laborer here who\r\nwould not be ashamed to wear them.'\r\n\r\nHe is much pleased with a finer lot selected later by his\r\nnephew's new wife. Perhaps he did not come up to modern notions\r\nof cleanliness (he was early advised by his father never to\r\nbathe but to have his body rubbed instead) but he was clean\r\ninside, which can not be said of all who make much of a\r\nwell-washed skin.\r\n\r\nHis intensity of purpose and fiery energy expressed themselves\r\nin his features and form. \"His face was round, his brow square,\r\nample,\" and deeply furrowed: \"the temples projected much beyond\r\nthe ears\"; his eyes were \"small rather than large,\" of a dark\r\n(some said horn) color and peered, piercingly, from under heavy\r\nbrows. The flattened nose was the result of a blow from a rival\r\napprentice. He evidently looked the part, though for such\r\nmental powers one of his colossal statues would seem a more\r\nfitting mold.\r\n\r\nMichelangelo experienced some illnesses, all but two of them of\r\nminor moment. In 1531 he \"became alarmingly ill, and the Pope\r\nordered him to quit most of his work and to take better care of\r\nhis health.\" That the illness was a storm merely of the surface\r\nis evidenced sufficiently in that his fresco of the \"Last\r\nJudgment,\" probably the most famous single picture in the\r\nworld, was begun years later and completed in his sixty-sixth\r\nyear. In the work of this epoch there is more than ever the\r\nevidence of a pouring forth of energy amounting almost to what\r\nthe critics call violence--to terribleness of action. It was\r\nnot until the age of seventy that an illness which seemed to\r\nmark any weakening of his bodily powers came upon him. At\r\nseventy-five, symptoms of calculus (a disease common in that\r\nday at fifty) appeared, but, though naturally pessimistic, he\r\nwrites, \"In all other respects I am pretty much as I was at\r\nthirty years.\" He improved under careful medical treatment, but\r\nthe illness and his age were sufficient to cause him to \"think\r\nof putting his spiritual and temporal affairs in better order\r\nthan he had hitherto done.\"\r\n\r\nHe wielded the brush and the chisel with consummate skill in\r\nhis seventy-fifth year. With the later loss of cunning his\r\nenergy found vent more in the planning and supervising of\r\narchitectural works, culminating in the building of St.\r\nPeter's, but even in these later years he took up the chisel as\r\nan outlet for superfluous energy and to induce sleep. Though\r\nthe product of his hand was not good, his health was the better\r\nfor this mutual exercise of mind and body. In his eighty-sixth\r\nyear he is said to have sat drawing for three consecutive hours\r\nuntil pains and cramps in his limbs warned him that he had not\r\nthe endurance of youth. For exercise, when manual labor proved\r\na disappointment, he often took horseback rides. There was no\r\ninvalidism about this great spirit, and it was not until the\r\nday before his death that he would consent to go to bed.\r\n\r\nIn a poem of his last years he burlesques his infirmities in\r\nhis usual vigorous manner.\r\n\r\n'I live alone and wretched, confined like the pith within the\r\nbark of the tree.... My voice is like a wasp imprisoned within\r\na sack of skin and bone. ... My teeth rattle like the keys of\r\nan old musical instrument.... My face is a scarecrow.... There\r\nis a ceaseless buzzing in my ears--in one a spider spins his\r\nweb, in the other a cricket chirps all night.... My catarrh,\r\nwhich causes a rattle in my throat, will not allow me to\r\nsleep.--Fatigue has quite broken me, and the hostlery which\r\nawaits me is Death.'\r\n\r\nFew men at his age have had less reason to find in themselves\r\nother than the changes to be expected with the passing of years\r\nand in prose he acknowledged that he had no more affections of\r\nthe flesh than were to be expected at his age. Codiva pictures\r\nhim in his last years as \"of good complexion; more muscular and\r\nbony than fat or fleshy in his person: healthy above all\r\nthings, as well by reason of his natural constitution as of the\r\nexercise he takes, and habitual continence in food and sexual\r\nindulgence.\" His temperance and manual industry and his\r\n\"extraordinary blamelessness in life and in every action\" had\r\nbeen his source of preservation. He was miserly, suspicious,\r\nquarrelsome and pessimistic, but the effects of these faults\r\nwere balanced by his better habits of thought and action. That\r\nhe, like most great men, felt keenly the value of health, is\r\nevidenced not only by his own practice, but by his oft repeated\r\nwarnings to his nephew when choosing a wife to see that\r\nwhatever other qualities she might have she be healthy. The\r\nblemish of nearsight he considered a no small defect and\r\nsufficient to render a young woman unworthy of entry into the\r\nproud family of the Buonarroti. To his own father he wrote:\r\n\"Look to your life and health, for a man does not come back\r\nagain to patch up things ill done.\"\r\n\r\nOne of those who look beneath unusual human phenomena for signs\r\nof the pathologic finds Michelangelo \"affected by a degree of\r\nneuropathy bordering closely upon hysterical disease.\" What a\r\npity that more of us do not suffer from such degrees of\r\nneuropathy--and how much better for most of us if we had such\r\nenthusiasm for perfection, and such mania for work, at least of\r\nthat health-bringing sort in which there is absorbing colabor\r\nof brain and hand. True it is that \"there is no better way of\r\nkeeping sane and free from anxiety than by being mad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSERVATION OF TALENT THROUGH UTILIZATION\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR JOHN M. GILLETTE\r\n\r\nSTATE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA\r\n\r\nTO raise the question of how to conserve talent is not an idle\r\ninquiry. We are in no immediate danger of famine. Yet there is\r\nan enormous interest being devoted to what is known as the\r\nconservation of soil. Our forests contain an abundance of\r\ntimber for near purposes, and when they are gone we shall\r\nprobably find a better substitute in the direction of concrete.\r\nStill agitation and discussion proceed relative to the\r\nconservation of our timber supply. We hear of conservation of\r\nchildhood, of conservation of health, of conservation of\r\nnatural scenery. It is a period of agitation for conservation\r\nof resources all along the line. This is all good. Real\r\nintelligent foresight is manifesting itself. Civilized man\r\ndemonstrates his superiority over uncivilized man most in the\r\nexercise of anticipation and prescience.\r\n\r\nAs compared with other natural resources, genius and talent are\r\nrelatively scarce articles. This is at least the popular\r\nimpression as to their quantity. Even scientific men, for the\r\nmost part, incline to this opinion. Unless we are able to\r\ndemonstrate that they are quite abundant this opinion must be\r\naccepted. I shall seek to show that the estimate of the amount\r\nof talent in existence which is usually accepted is too small.\r\nHowever, we are in no peril of so inflating the potential\r\nsupply of talent and genius in the course of our remarks that\r\nthey may be regarded as universal. Nor are we likely to\r\ndiscover such a rich lode of this commodity that the world may\r\nrun riot in its consumption of the visible supply. Talent\r\npromises to remain so scarce that, granting for the moment that\r\nit is a useful agent, its supply must be conserved.\r\n\r\nI shall use the term talent so as to include genius. Both\r\ntalent and genius are of the same kind. Their essential\r\ndifference consists in degree. Increase what is commonly called\r\ntalent in the direction of its manifestation and it would\r\ndevelop into genius. Genius is commonly thought of as something\r\nabnormal, in the sense that it is essentially eccentric. A\r\ngenius is generally spoken of as an eccentric, erratic,\r\nunbalanced, person. The eccentricity is then taken as\r\nconstituting the substance of the quality of genius. This is\r\nundoubtedly a mistake. Because some geniuses have been erratic,\r\nthe popular imagination has formed its picture of all genius as\r\nunbalanced. The majority of the world's men of genius have been\r\nas balanced and normal in their judgments as the average man.\r\nWe may think of a genius as like the ordinary man in his\r\nconstitution. He has the same mental faculties, the same\r\nemotions, the same kind of determinizing ability. What makes\r\nhim a genius is his power of concentration in his given field\r\nof work. The moral quality, or zeal to accomplish, or energy\r\ndirected toward intellectual operations stands enormously above\r\nthat of the average individual. If we could confer this quality\r\nof moral will on the common normal man possibly we would raise\r\nhim to that degree which we term genius.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the worth of conserving talent we must\r\nestimate its value as a commodity, as a world asset. I shall,\r\ntherefore, turn my attention first to discovering a method of\r\nreckoning the value of eminent men.\r\n\r\nOne method open to us is what may be called the individualistic\r\ntest. Under this method we think of the individual as\r\nindividual or of his work as a concrete case of production. One\r\nphase of this is the individual's estimate of his own powers.\r\nWe may inquire what is the man's appreciation of his own worth.\r\nThis is precarious because of two difficulties. There is an\r\negotistical element in individuals. It is inherent as a\r\nhistorical agent of self-preservation. Most of us are like\r\nprimitive groups. The ethnologist expects to find every tribe\r\nor horde of savages claiming to be THE PEOPLE. They ascribe\r\nsuperior qualities to their group. In their names for their\r\ngroup they call themselves the people, the men, and so on,\r\nindicating their point of view.\r\n\r\nAgain, an individual, however honestly he might try, could not\r\nestimate his own worth accurately. Let any of us attempt to see\r\nourselves as others see us and we shall discover the difficulty\r\nof the undertaking. We are not able to get the perspective\r\nbecause our personal feelings, our necessary selfish\r\nself-appreciation, puts our judgments awry. Others close to us\r\nmay do little better. They are likely to either underrate us or\r\nto exaggerate our qualities and powers. In the United States we\r\nare called on to evaluate Mr. Taft and Mr. Roosevelt. Is either\r\nof them a great man? Has either of them been a great president?\r\nOpinions differ. We are too close to them. We do not know. We\r\ngive them credit, perhaps, for doing things which the age would\r\nhave worked out in spite of them. Or we think things would have\r\ncome inevitably which their personal efforts, it will be found,\r\nwere responsible for establishing. We have not yet been able to\r\ndetermine accurately just how great Abraham Lincoln was. It is\r\nalmost half a century since he did his work. But we live in the\r\npresence of the personal relative to him yet. Sentiment enters\r\nin and obfuscates judgment.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the product itself as mere product we are at a\r\nloss. Unless we ask what is the import of the work we confess\r\nwe do not know. A man in Connecticut has made a manikin. It\r\nwalks, talks, does many of the things which human beings do.\r\nBut it is not alive, it is not serviceable, it can accomplish\r\nnothing. Suppose the maker passes his life in making probably\r\nthe most intricate and perfect mechanism which has been made.\r\nIs he a genius? We may admit that the products manifest great\r\ningenuity on the part of their creator, yet we feel repelled\r\nwhen we think of calling the maker a genius.\r\n\r\nThe community method of rating talent is far more satisfactory.\r\nThe inventor is related to his time or to human society by\r\nmeans of the usefulness of his invention. The statesman is\r\nrated by means of the deep-seated influence for improvement he\r\nhas had on his age. The educator finds his evaluation in the\r\nconstructive spirit and method he displays in bringing useful\r\nspirit and methods to light. The scientist is measured by the\r\nuplift his discovery gives to the sum and substance of human\r\nwelfare. If a product which some individual creates can not be\r\nutilized by society, its creator is not regarded as having made\r\na contribution to human progress. As a consequence he does not\r\nget a rating as genius. To get the appraisal of mankind the\r\nproduct of the man of talent must get generally accepted, must\r\nfill the want of society generally or of some clientele. If a\r\nman produces something merely ingenious, something which does\r\nnot serve a considerable portion of humanity in the way of\r\nsatisfying a want, if his creation does not pass into use, he\r\ndoes not step into the current of the world's history as a\r\nfruitful factor, he fails to attain to the rank of talent.\r\n\r\nThis objective measure of the value of the producer puts talent\r\ninto direct relation to the concept of social evolution and\r\nprogress. Society has been an evolution. Collective humanity\r\nhas gone through distinctive metamorphoses. Distinct strides in\r\nadvance have been made, tendencies have manifested themselves,\r\nconditions have changed so that larger satisfactions have\r\nensued, democracy in the essential wants of mankind has been\r\nwrought out. Society is more complex in its quantitative\r\naspect. It is more serviceable by reason of its greater\r\nspecialization. Since progress stands for improvement it has\r\ncome to be regarded as a desirable thing.\r\n\r\nIn the sociological conception of things the genius possesses a\r\nspecific social function. He is not a passing curiosity. He is\r\nnot produced for amusement. He does not stand unrelated. He is\r\nthe product of his age, is articulated with its life, performs\r\nan office which is of consequence to it. He is the connecting\r\nlink between the past and the future. He takes what was and so\r\ncombines it anew as to produce what is to be. He is the\r\ninnovator, the initiator, the agent of transformation, the\r\ncreator of a new order. Hence he is the exceptional man. The\r\nmasses of men are imitators. They make nothing new, add nothing\r\nto the mechanism of social structure, introduce no new\r\nfunctions, produce no achievements, do nothing which changes\r\nthe order of things. The common people are quite as important\r\nfor the purposes of society as are the talented. Society must\r\nbe conserved most of the time or we should all float down the\r\nstream of change too rapidly for comfort. Hence the function of\r\nthe great mass of individuals is to seize and use the\r\nachievements which the creators, the talented have brought into\r\nexistence. We may conclude, therefore, that if society is to be\r\nimproved and if the lives of the great body of human beings are\r\nto be endowed with more and more blessings, material and\r\nspiritual, we must look to the men of talent, the men of\r\nachievement, and to them 'alone, for the initiation of these\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWe may say, then, that we have discovered not only the method\r\nof estimating the value of talent, but also in what its value\r\nconsists. If progress is desirable, talent by means of which\r\nthat progress is secured is likewise valuable. And, like other\r\nthings, its value is measured by its scarcity. It is now\r\nincumbent on us to attempt to discover the extent of the supply\r\nof this commodity, both actual and possible.\r\n\r\nI shall refer to two estimates of the amount of talent in\r\nexistence which have been made because they differ so much in\r\ntheir conclusions as to the extent of talent, and because they\r\nexhibit quite different view-points and methods.\r\n\r\nThe great English scientist and benefactor of the race, Sir\r\nFrancis Galton, in his work entitled \"Hereditary Genius\" made a\r\ncomputation of the number of men of eminence in the British\r\nIsles. This estimate was made nearly a half-century ago and has\r\ngenerally been accepted as representing actual conditions. One\r\nmeans of discovering the number was by taking a catalogue of\r\n\"Men of The Times\" which contained about 2,500 names, one half\r\nof which were Americans and Europeans. He found that most of\r\nthe men were past fifty years of age. Relative to this he\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n'It appears that in the cases of high (but by no means in that\r\nof the highest) merit, a man must outlive the age of fifty to\r\nbe sure of being widely appreciated. It takes time for an able\r\nman, born in the humbler ranks of life, to emerge from them and\r\nto take his natural position.'[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Cattell's investigations of American men of science\r\ndisproves this statement for Americans. He finds that only a\r\nfew men enter the ranks of that class of men after the age of\r\nfifty, and that none of that age reach the highest place. The\r\nfecund age is from 35 to 45; (\"American Men of Science,\" p.\r\n575.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter eliminating the non-British individuals he compared the\r\nnumber of celebrities above fifty with males of the same age\r\nfor the whole British population. He found about 850 who were\r\nabove fifty. Of this age there were about 2,000,000 males in\r\nthe British Isles. Hence the meritorious were as 425 to\r\n1,000,000, and the more select were as 250 to 1,000,000. He\r\nstated what he considered the qualifications of the more select\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n'The qualifications for belonging to what I call the more\r\nselect part are, in my mind, that a man should have\r\ndistinguished himself pretty frequently either by purely\r\noriginal work, or as a leader of opinion. I wholly exclude\r\nnotoriety obtained by a single act. This is a fairly well\r\ndefined line, because there is not room for many men to become\r\neminent.'\r\n\r\nMr. Galton made another estimate by studying an obituary list\r\npublished in The Times in 1868. This contained 50 men of the\r\nselect class. He considered it broader than his former estimate\r\nbecause it excluded men dying before they attained their\r\nbroadest reputation, and more rigorous because it excluded old\r\nmen who had previously attained a reputation which they were\r\nnot able to sustain. He consequently lowered the age to 45. In\r\nGreat Britain there were 210,000 males who died yearly of that\r\nage. This gave a result of 50 men of exceptional merit to\r\n210,000 of the population, or 238 to the million.\r\n\r\nHis third estimate was made by the study of obituaries of many\r\nyears back. This led to similar conclusions, namely, that about\r\n250 to the million is an ample estimate of the number of\r\neminent men. He says:\r\n\r\n'When I speak of an eminent man, I mean one who has achieved a\r\nposition that is attained by only 250 persons in each million\r\nof men, or by one person in each 4,000.'\r\n\r\nThe other estimate of the amount of talent in existence has\r\nbeen made by one of our most eminent American sociologists, the\r\nlate Lester F. Ward. The elaborate treatment of this matter is\r\nfound in his \"Applied Sociology,\" and offers an illustration of\r\na most rigorous and thorough application of the scientific\r\nmethod to the subject in question. The essential facts for the\r\nstudy were furnished by Odin in his work on the genesis of the\r\nliterary men of France, although Candole, Jacoby and others are\r\nlaid under contribution for data. Maps, tables and diagrams are\r\nused whenever they can be made to secure results. Odin's study\r\ncovered the period of over five hundred years of France and\r\nFrench regions, or from 1300 to 1825. Out of over thirteen\r\nthousand literary names he chose some 6,200 as representing men\r\nof genius, talent or merit, the former constituting much the\r\nsmaller and the latter much the larger of the total number.\r\n\r\nThe object of Ward's investigation is to discover the factor or\r\nfactors in the situation which are responsible for the\r\nproduction of genius. In the course of examination it was seen\r\nthat certain communities were very much more prolific than\r\nothers in producing talent. Paris, for instance, produced 123\r\nper 100,000; Geneva, Switzerland, 196; certain chateaux as many\r\nas 200, and some communities none at all or very few. After\r\nconsidering the various factors which account for the high rate\r\nin certain localities and the low rate or absence of merit in\r\nothers the conclusion is reached that we should expect the\r\npresence of the meritorious class generally in even greater\r\nnumbers than it has existed in the most fruitful regions of the\r\nFrench people.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward's studies have led him to conclude that talent is\r\nlatent in society, that it exists in greater abundance than we\r\nhave ever dared to expect, that all classes possess it equally\r\nand would manifest it equally if obstacles were removed or\r\nopportunities offered for its development. Education is the key\r\nto the situation in his estimation. It affords the opportunity\r\nwhich latent talent requires for its promotion, and if this\r\nwere intelligently applied to all classes and to both sexes\r\nalike instead of securing one man of talent for each 4,000\r\npersons as Mr. Galton held, we would be able to mature one for\r\nevery 500 of our population. This would represent an\r\neight-hundred-per-cent. increase of the talented class, an\r\neight-fold multiplication. It is an estimate of not the number\r\nof the talented who are known to be such, but of society's\r\npotential or latent talent.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] Investigations made on school children by the Binet test\r\nindicate Ward's estimate is conservative. It has been found\r\nthat from two to three out of every hundred children are of\r\nexceptional ability, thus belonging to the talented, or at\r\nleast merit class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause these estimates are so divergent, it may be worth while\r\nto consider the reason for the difference. And in taking this\r\nup we come to the fundamentally distinct point of view of the\r\ntwo investigators. Mr. Galton's work is an illustration of the\r\nview which regards talent as a product of the hereditary\r\nfactors. Mr. Galton believed that heredity accounts for talent\r\nand that it is so dominant in the lives of the talented that it\r\nis bound to express itself as talent. In his estimation there\r\nis no such thing as latent genius, because it is in the nature\r\nof genius that it surmounts all obstacles. He says:\r\n\r\n'By natural ability, I mean those qualities of intellect and\r\ndisposition, which urge and qualify a man to perform acts which\r\nlead to reputation. I do not mean capacity without zeal, nor\r\nzeal without capacity, nor even a combination of both of them,\r\nwithout an adequate power of doing a great deal of very\r\nlaborious work. But I mean a nature which, when left to itself,\r\nwill, urged by an inherent stimulus, climb the path that leads\r\nto eminence, and has strength to reach the summit--one which,\r\nif hindered or thwarted, will fret and strive until the\r\nhindrance is overcome, and it is again free to follow its\r\nlabor-saving instinct.'[2]\r\n\r\n[3] \"Hereditary Genius,\" pp. 37-8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis in reality amounts to saying that the genius is\r\nomnipotent. Nothing can prevent the development of the genius.\r\nHe is master of all difficulties by the very fact that he is a\r\ngenius. It is also equivalent, by implication, to saying that\r\nobstacles can have no qualifying effect on the course of such\r\nan individual. A great difficulty is no more to him than a\r\nsmall one. Hence no matter in what circumstances he lives he is\r\nalways bound to gain the maximum of his development. He could\r\nnot be either greater or less than he is, notwithstanding the\r\nforce of circumstances, whether obstructive or propitious. The\r\nenergy of a genius is thus differentiated from all other forms\r\nof energy. Other forms of energy are modified in their course\r\nand effects by preventing obstacles. Add to or subtract from\r\nthe impediments and the effect of the energy is changed by the\r\namount of the impediments. But this doctrine completely\r\nemancipates human energy, when manifested in the form of\r\ngenius, from the working of the law of cause and effect.\r\n\r\nIt is especially noteworthy that it is not what we should\r\nexpect in view of the place and function of the environment in\r\nthe course of evolution. To say the least environment enjoys a\r\nvery respectable influence in selecting and directing the\r\nforces of development. Some men have gone so far as to make the\r\nexternal factors account for everything in society. Discounting\r\nthis claim, the minimum biological statement is that the\r\nenvironment exercises a selective function relative to organic\r\nforms and variations. It opposes itself to the transmission\r\nstrain, and if unfavorable to it, may eliminate it entirely. To\r\nbe able to accomplish this it must be regarded as having an\r\ninfluence on all forms. And as there are all grades of\r\nenvironment from the most unfavorable to the most propitious,\r\nsimilarly constituted organisms living in those various\r\nenvironments must perforce fare differently, some being\r\nhindered others being promoted in varying degrees. That is,\r\nshould the most able by birth appear in the most unfavorable\r\nenvironment they could not be expected to make the same gains\r\nin life as similar congenitally able who appear in the most\r\nfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward, on the contrary, holds that genius, like all other\r\nforms of human ability, is the product of circumstances. It is\r\ndetermined in its raw form by heredity, to be sure. In similar\r\ncircumstances it will affect more than the average man. But\r\nlike all other forms of energy it is subject to the law of\r\ncausality. It is not omnipotent so that it is able to set at\r\nnaught the effects of opposing forces. Nor can it develop in\r\nthe absence of nourishing circumstances. Deprive it of cultural\r\nopportunities and it is like the sprout of the majestic tree\r\nwhich is deprived of moisture, or the great river cut off from\r\nthe supply of snow and rain. In other words, it is a product of\r\nall the factors at work in its being and environment, and the\r\ninternal can not manifest itself or its powers without the\r\npresence of the external. Modify the external factors to a\r\nperceptible degree and the individual is modified to the same\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nIn seeking to find the factors which are accountable for the\r\ndevelopment of talent Mr. Ward takes into consideration those\r\nof the physical environment, the ethnological, the religious,\r\nthe local, the economic, the social, and the educational. Each\r\none of these items is given a searching examination as to its\r\nforce. I shall briefly deal with each of these in turn, giving\r\nthe import of the findings in each case and as many of the\r\nbasic facts as possible in a small space.\r\n\r\nBy a consideration of French regions by departments, provinces,\r\nand principal sections, as to their yield of talent, the\r\nphysical environment was found to have had no perceptible\r\ninfluence. The mountain-situated Geneva and the lowland Paris\r\nproduced alike prolifically talented men. The valley of the\r\nSeine and that of the Loire competed for hegemony in fecundity.\r\nThe facts contradicted the highland theory, the lowland theory,\r\nthe coast theory, and every other theory of the dominance of\r\nphysical environment.\r\n\r\nTo get at the influence of the ethnological factor the Gaulic,\r\nCimbrian, Iberian, Ligurian and Belgic elements of the\r\npopulation were examined as to their fecundity in talent. Odin\r\nconfesses to being unable to discover \"the least connection\r\nbetween races and fecundity in men of letters.\" Attention was\r\npaid likewise to races speaking other than French language.\r\nAgain there was a conflict of facts. Inside of France\r\nethnological elements exerted \"no appreciable influence upon\r\nliterary productivity.\" In Belgium and Lorraine, where the\r\nGerman language dominated, it was found that French literature\r\nmastered the situation, thus indicating that a common language\r\ndoes not necessitate a common literature. The conclusion\r\nethnologically is that races possess an equality in yielding\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\nThe religious factor was found to have been more influential\r\nformerly in bringing to light talent than at the close of the\r\nfive-hundred-year period. From 1300 to 1700 the church\r\nfurnished on the average 37.8 per cent. of all literary talent.\r\nIts fecundity dropped to 29 in the period from 1700 to 1750.\r\nBetween 1750 and 1825 it produced but 6.5 of the talent. As\r\nGalton has shown, eminent men were killed or driven out during\r\nthe period of religious persecution in Spain, France and Italy.\r\nThe celibacy of the clergy which gave undisturbed leisure may\r\nhave been an element in making the church productive in the\r\nearlier years. On the other hand, the quieting effect of family\r\nlife of the protestant ministry seems to have had a propitious\r\ninfluence in later times, as there appeared a relative increase\r\namong protestant clergy of talent, while the output among the\r\ncatholic clergy continued to decline.\r\n\r\nIn this investigation the local environment appeared to have\r\nthe most influence in the production of talent. Odin gave\r\nwitness to having a suspicion that somewhere there was a\r\nneglected factor. The facts connected talent with the cities in\r\nan overwhelming manner. The statement that genius is the\r\nproduct of the rural regions seems to have had no legs to stand\r\non. The majority of the talented were born in the cities and\r\npractically all of them were connected with city life.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to population the cities produced 12.77, almost\r\nthirteen times as many men of talent as rural regions. The\r\nwhole of France produced 6,382, the number selected by Odin as\r\nthe more meritorious of the men of letters. If all France had\r\nbeen as productive as Paris it would have yielded 53,640; if as\r\nfecund as the other chief cities, it would have produced\r\n22,060; but if only as fertile as the country the number would\r\nhave fallen to 1,522.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the matter of population has something to do\r\nwith the production of talent. Aggregations of population offer\r\nfrequent contact of persons, division of labor, competition\r\nbetween individuals, a better coordination of society for\r\ncooperative results, neutralization of physical qualities, and\r\nthe ascendancy of innovation over the conservative attitude. It\r\nis not the mere density of population which is the effective\r\nelement. It is rather the dynamic density which is productive,\r\nthat is, the manifestation of the common life and spirit. City\r\nlife is specialized in structure and function, rendering men\r\nmore interdependent and cooperative. Specialization means moral\r\ncoalescence\r\n\r\nThe chateaux of France are very prolific in producing talent.\r\nThey yielded 2 per cent. of all the talent of the period,\r\nseemingly out of proportion to their importance.\r\n\r\nWhy are certain of the cities and the chateaux more fertile\r\nthan most cities and the country in producing the talented? We\r\nhave a general reply in the statement as to the dynamic density\r\nof cities. A further analysis finds those communities are\r\npossessed of elements which the country does not have. Odin\r\ncalls them \"properties.\" They are the location of the\r\npolitical, administrative and judicial agencies of society;\r\nthey are in possession of great wealth and talent; they are\r\ndepositories of learning and the tools of information. The\r\navenues which open upon talent and the tools and agencies by\r\nmeans of which the passage to it is to be made segregate\r\nthemselves in cities and towns\r\n\r\nAs the result of his investigation into the distribution of men\r\nof science in the United States, Professor Cattell arrives at\r\nnearly the same conclusion. He writes:\r\n\r\n'The main factors in producing scientific and other forms of\r\nintellectual performance seem to be density of population,\r\ninstitutions and social traditions and ideals. All these may be\r\nultimately due to race, but, given the existing race, the\r\nscientific productivity of the nation can be increased in\r\nquantity, though not in quality, almost to the extent that we\r\nwish to increase it.'[4]\r\n\r\n[4] \"American Men of Science,\" Second edition, p. 654.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that nearly all of the women of\r\ntalent have been born in cities and chateaux. This means that\r\nwomen had to be born where the means of development were to be\r\nhad, as they were not free to move about in society, as were\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeriods          Rich          Poor\r\n1300-1500          24          1\r\n1500-1550          39          4\r\n1551-1600          42          --\r\n1601-1650          84          5\r\n1651-1700          73          4\r\n1701-1725          36          3\r\n1726-1750          53          7\r\n1751-1775          86          8\r\n1776-1800          52          12\r\n1801-1825          73          11\r\n                  ----        ----\r\nTotal             562          57, or 9 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economic factor has been an important one in offering the\r\nleisure which is necessary for the development of talent. Men\r\nwho have to use their time and energy wholly in the support of\r\nthemselves and families are deprived of the leisure which\r\nproductivity and creativeness in work demands. Of the French\r\nmen of letters 35 per cent. belonged to the wealthy or noble\r\nclass, 42 per cent. to the middle class, and 23 per cent. to\r\nthe working class. Odin was able to discover the economic\r\nenvironment of 619 men of talent. They were distributed by\r\nperiods between the rich and poor as shown in the table on page\r\n169.\r\n\r\nOf one hundred foreign associates of the French Academy the\r\nmembership of the wealthy, middle and working classes were 41,\r\n52 and 7. A combination of two other of Candole's tables yields\r\nfor those classes in per cents 35, 42 and 23. In ancient and\r\nmedieval times practically all of the talented came from the\r\nwealthy class. On the whole, but about one eleventh of the men\r\nof talent had to fight with economic adversity. But when we\r\nremember that the wealthy class formed but a small portion of\r\nthe population in each period, probably not more than one\r\nfourth, this means that as compared with members of the working\r\nclass individuals of the wealthy class had forty or fifty times\r\nas good a chance of rising to a position of eminence. The\r\ncontrast is so sharp that Odin is led to exclaim, \"Genius is in\r\nthings, not in man.\"\r\n\r\nThe social and the economic factors are so closely intertwined\r\nthat the influence of the social environment is already seen in\r\ntreating the economic. The social deals with matter of classes\r\nand callings. The upper classes are of course the wealthier\r\nclasses so that the social and economic measures largely agree.\r\nIn Mr. Galton's inquiry into the callings of English men of\r\nscience which he made in 1873, it appears that out of 96\r\ninvestigated 9 were noblemen or gentlemen, 18 government\r\nofficials, 34 professional men, 43 business men, 2 farmers and\r\n1 other. Unless the one other was a working man the workers\r\nproduced none of these 96 men of science. Odin's classification\r\nof the French men of letters gives to the nobility 25.5 per\r\ncent., to government officials 20.0, liberal professions 23.0,\r\nbourgeoise 11.6, manual laborers 9.8. Only a little over one\r\nfifth of the talented were produced by the two lower classes.\r\nYet in numerical weight those classes constituted 90 per cent.\r\nof the population. Data from four other European countries show\r\nvery much the same results, except that the workers and\r\nbourgeoise classes make a better showing. It is unquestionable,\r\ntherefore, that the opportunities for developing talent or\r\ngenius are largely withheld from the working class and bestowed\r\non the upper classes.\r\n\r\nWe have yet one other factor to treat in the production of\r\ntalent, namely, the educational. The facts relative to the\r\neducation of the talented contradicts the assumption usually\r\nmade that genius depends on education and opportunity for none\r\nof its success, but rises to its heights in spite of or without\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOf 827 men of talent (not merit class) Odin was able to\r\ninvestigate as to their education he found that only 1.8 per\r\ncent. had no education or a poor education, while 98.2 per\r\ncent. had a good education. This number investigated was 73 per\r\ncent. of all men of that class, and it is fair to assume that\r\nabout the same proportion of educated existed in the other 27\r\nper cent. whose education was not known. Of the 16 of poor or\r\nno education 13 were born in Paris, other large cities, or\r\nchateaux, and three in other localities. Thus they had the\r\nopportunities presented by the cities. Facts as to talented men\r\nin Spain, Italy, England and Germany indicate that anywhere\r\nfrom 92 to 98 per cent. have been highly educated, and probably\r\nthe latter per cent. is correct.\r\n\r\nThese figures can have but one meaning. They indicate that\r\ntalent and genius are dependent on educational and conventional\r\nagencies of the cultural kind, as are other human beings for\r\ntheir evolution. Otherwise we should expect the figures to be\r\nreversed. If education and cultural opportunities count for\r\nnaught, then we should expect that, at a time when education\r\nwas by no means universal, the 90 or 98 per cent. Of genius\r\nwould mount on their eagle wings and soar to the summits of\r\neminence, clearing completely the conventional educational\r\ndevices which society had established.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion, therefore, is that social and economic\r\nopportunities afford the leisure as well as cultural advantages\r\nfor the improvement of talent; that the local environment is of\r\nvital importance, offering as it does the cultural advantages\r\nof cities of certain kinds and of chateaux, and that of the\r\nlocal environment the educational facilities are of the\r\nsupremest importance. Consequently, it appears that Mr. Ward's\r\nestimate of one person of talent to the 500 instead of Mr.\r\nGalton's estimate of one to the 4,000 does not seem strained.\r\nProduce in society generally the opportunities and advantages\r\nwhich Geneva, Paris and the chateaux possessed and which gave\r\nthem their great fecundity in talent, and all regions and\r\nplaces will yield up their potential or latent genius to\r\ndevelopment and the ratio will be obtained.\r\n\r\nThis position is likely to be criticized, unless it is\r\nremembered that we admit that there is a hereditary difference\r\nat birth, and that all we seek to establish is that, given\r\nthese differences, what conditions are likely to mature and\r\ndevelop the men of born talent. Thus after the appearance of my\r\n\"Vocational Education\" I received a letter from Professor\r\nEugene Davenport in which he makes this statement:\r\n\r\n'Ward's arguments as here employed seem to show that\r\nenvironment is a powerful factor in bringing out talent even to\r\nthe exclusion of heredity. I doubt if you would care to be\r\nunderstood to this limit, and yet where you enumerate on page\r\n61 the reasons why certain cities are fecund in respective\r\ntalents, you seem to have overlooked the fact that if these\r\ncities have been for many generations centers of talent to such\r\nan extent as to provide exceptional environmental influences,\r\nthe same conditions would also provide exceptional parentage,\r\nso that the birthrate of talent would be much higher in such a\r\nregion than the normal. In other words, the very same\r\nconditions which would provide exceptional opportunities for\r\ndevelopment also and at the same time provide an exceptional\r\nbirth condition. This is the rock on which very many arguments\r\ntending to compare heredity and environment wreck\r\nthemselves.'[5]\r\n\r\n[5] This is a criticism that needs to be met. Mr. George R.\r\nDavies of this institution has submitted facts in a paper which\r\nappeared in the March number of the Quarterly Journal of the\r\nUniversity of North Dakota, which fills in the gap. He shows\r\nrelative to American cities that there has been little or no\r\nsegregation of talented parentage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at a point where we are able to consider the\r\nquestion of the conservation of talent. A position of advantage\r\nhas been gained from which to view this question. For we have\r\nseen that talent has a decidedly important and indispensable\r\nsocial function to perform. It is the creative and contributive\r\nagency, the cause of achievement, and a vital factor in\r\nprogress. Its conservation is consequently devoutly to be\r\ndesired. We have also discovered the fact that, while a rare\r\ncommodity, it is present in society in a larger measure than we\r\nhave commonly believed. If progress is desirable in a measure\r\nit is likely to be desirable in a large measure. If talent is\r\nable to carry us forward at a certain rate with the development\r\nof a minimum of the quantity that is in existence we should be\r\nable to greatly accelerate our progress if all that is latent\r\ncould be developed and put into active operation. Further, we\r\nhave obtained some insight into the conditions which favor the\r\ndevelopment of talent and likewise some of the obstacles to its\r\nmanifestation. If it abounds where certain conditions are\r\npresent in the situation and fails to appear where those\r\nconditions are absent, we have a fertile suggestion as to the\r\nmethod of social control and direction which will bring the\r\nlatent talent to fertility.\r\n\r\nWe must undoubtedly hold that if a larger supply of talent\r\nexists than is discovered, developed and put to use that,\r\nsince, as we have seen, it is so valuable when estimated in\r\nterms of social progress, we are dealing wastefully with\r\ntalent. We are allowing great ability to go to waste since we\r\nare leaving it lie in its undeveloped form. Therefore one of\r\nthe problems of the proper conservation of talent consists in\r\nfinding a method of discovering and releasing this valuable\r\nform of social energy.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to inquire how this may be done, how this\r\ndiscovery is to take place, we must take for our guide the\r\nfacts which were found to bear on the maturing of talent in the\r\nabove studies. We discovered that the local environment seemed\r\nto contain the influential element in bringing forth talent.\r\nWhen that local environment was analyzed it turned out that the\r\nitems of opportunity for leisure and the facilities for\r\neducation were the most fruitful factors. Leisure is absolutely\r\nessential to afford that opportunity for self-development which\r\nis required even of the most talented. This can only be had\r\nwhen the income of the individual is sufficient to give him a\r\nconsiderable part of his active time for carrying out his\r\nintellectual aspirations. We have great numbers of people whom\r\nwe have reason to believe are as able on the average, have as\r\nlarge a proportion of talent as the well-to-do, whose poverty\r\nis so crushing and whose days of toil are so long and so\r\nconsuming of energy that the element of leisure is lacking. It\r\nis only an occasional individual of this class of people who is\r\nable to secure the wealth which means a measure of leisure by\r\nwhich he is able to mount out of obscurity. An improvement in\r\nthe physical conditions of life of these people, together with\r\nan increase in their economic possibilities is a necessary\r\nmeans to the proper conservation of the talent of this group.\r\n\r\nThe cultural factor is one which must be made more omnipresent\r\nthan it is now before we shall be able to awake the latent\r\ntalent of the masses of people. There are certain sections of\r\nall nations, and more especially of such nations as the United\r\nStates, where the population is widely scattered over vast\r\nareas of farming regions in which the opportunities for\r\neducation and stimulative enterprises and institutions are\r\nlacking or meager. The same is true of very large sections of\r\nthe populations of the cities. In both cases large\r\nneighborhoods exist in which the lives of the people move in a\r\nhumdrum rut, never disturbed by matters which arouse the\r\ncreative element in human nature. Especially is this important\r\nin the early years of life where the outlook for the whole\r\nfuture of the individual is so strongly stamped. To come into\r\ncontact with no stimulus and arousing agent in the home, or the\r\nneighborhood in the earliest years is to become settled into a\r\nlife-long habit of inert dullness.\r\n\r\nWhen we revert to the schools which so generally abound, we\r\nfail to find the stimulating element in them which might be\r\nregarded as the necessary opportunity to develop talent. The\r\nvast majority of elementary teachers are persons whose\r\nintellectual natures have never been aroused. Their imaginative\r\nand sympathetic capacities lie undeveloped. Their work in the\r\nschool is conducted on the basis of memory. It is parrot work\r\nand ends in making parrots of the pupils. The rational and\r\ncausal as agencies in education are hardly ever appealed to.\r\nUntil our teaching force is itself developed in the directions\r\nand capacities which alone characterize the intellectual we can\r\nnot hope for much in the way of recovering the rich field of\r\nlatent talent from its infertility.\r\n\r\nSomething remains to be said about the proper utilization of\r\ntalent which has been developed. Did all genius depend on the\r\nhereditary factor and consequently we had developed all\r\nindividuals possessing exceptional ability into contributors\r\nand creators, the question of their complete utilization by\r\nsociety remains. That all able men and women are working at the\r\nexact thing and in the exact place and under the exact methods\r\nwhich will yield the greatest and most fruitful results for\r\nsociety only the superficial could believe. Herbert Spencer\r\nused up a very large part of his superb ability during the\r\nlarger portion of his life in the drudgery of making a living.\r\nThe work of the national eugenics laboratory of England is\r\ncarried on by a man of great talent, Professor Carl Pearson, in\r\ncramped quarters and with insufficient equipment and support.\r\nThe enterprise is as important as any in England, that of\r\ndiscovering the conditions and means of improving the human\r\nrace. The laboratory was built up in the first instance by the\r\nsacrifice of Sir Francis Galton, and it is maintained by means\r\nof the bequest of his personal fortune.\r\n\r\nThese are but instances of the many which exist where talented\r\nindividuals are working under great handicaps which neither\r\npromote their talent nor secure fecundity of results to\r\ncollective man. In nearly every line of human endeavor gifted\r\nindividuals are consuming in an unnecessarily wasteful manner,\r\nfrom the point of view of social improvement, their splendid\r\nabilities. In educational institutions trained experts and\r\nspecialists are doing the work which very ordinary ability of a\r\nmerely clerical kind could conduct, sacrificing the higher and\r\nmore fruitful attainments thereby. I have known a faculty of\r\nsome forty members who were compelled to register the term\r\nstandings by sitting in a circle and calling off the grades of\r\nseveral hundred students student by student and class by class\r\nfor each student as it came their turn, while a clerk recorded\r\nthe grades. The process consumed about ten hours per member\r\neach term, or something over a thousand hours a year for the\r\nwhole faculty. Both economically and socially it was expensive\r\nand wasteful because a cheap clerk could have done the whole\r\nfar better and have released the talent for productive\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nWe shall be wise when we realize the worth of our workable\r\ntalent and so establish its working conditions that it may\r\nsecure the full measure of its productiveness. If scientific\r\nmanagement for the mass of laborers of a nation is worth while\r\nhow much more serviceable would it be to extend its fructifying\r\ninfluence to the most able members of the community.\r\n\r\nBut how to proceed in order to make the discovery of the latent\r\ntalent is the pressing problem. For a long time our methods\r\npromise to be as empirical as are those we employ for the\r\nadvancement of science. Relative to the latter, after\r\nenumerating a large list of conditions for promoting science of\r\nwhich we are ignorant, Professor Cattell says:\r\n\r\n'In the face of endless problems of this character we are as\r\nempirical in our methods as the doctor of physic a hundred\r\nyears ago or the agricultural laborer to-day. It is surely time\r\nfor scientific men to apply scientific methods to determine the\r\ncircumstances that promote or hinder the advancement of\r\nscience.'[6]\r\n\r\n[6] \"American Men of Science,\" p. 565.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the discovery and utilization of genius and talent in\r\ngeneral are so closely related to the problem of the promotion\r\nof science, his statement may be adopted to express the demand\r\nexisting in those directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR, BUSINESS AND INSURANCE[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Chairman's address on Peace Day of the Insurance Congress,\r\nPanama-Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco, October\r\n11, 1915.\r\n\r\nBY CHANCELLOR DAVID STARR JORDAN\r\n\r\nSTANFORD UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nTHE complications behind the war in Europe are very many,\r\nruthless exploitation, heartless and brainless diplomacy,\r\nfutile dreams of national expansion (the \"Mirage of the Map\"),\r\nof national enrichment through the use of force (the \"Great\r\nIllusion\"), and withal a widespread vulgar belief in\r\nindemnities or highway robberies as a means of enriching a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAll these would represent only the unavoidable collision,\r\nunrest and ambition of human nature, were it not that every\r\nelement involved in it was armed to the teeth. \"When blood is\r\ntheir argument\" in matters of business or politics, all\r\nrational interests are imperilled. The gray old strategists to\r\nwhom the control of armament was assigned saw the nations\r\nmoving towards peaceful solution of their real and imaginary\r\ndifficulties. The young men of Europe had visions of a broader\r\nworld, one cleared of lies and hate and the poison of an\r\ningrowing patriotism. After a generation of doubt and pessimism\r\nin which world progress seemed to end in a blind sack, there\r\nwas rising a vision of continental cooperation, a glimpse of\r\nthe time when science, always international, should also\r\ninternationalize the art of living.\r\n\r\nClearly the close season for war was near at hand. The old men\r\nfound means to bring it on and in so doing to exploit the\r\npatriotism, enthusiasm, devotion and love of adventure of the\r\nyoung men of the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe use of fear and force as an argument in politics or in\r\nbusiness--this is war. It is a futile argument because of\r\nitself it settles nothing. Its conclusion bears no certain\r\nrelation to its initial aim. It must end where it should begin,\r\nwith an agreement among the parties concerned. War is only the\r\nblind negation, the denial of all law, and only the recognition\r\nof the supremacy of some law can bring war to an end. In time\r\nof war all laws are silent as are all efforts for progress, for\r\njustice, for the betterment of human kind. If history were\r\nwritten truthfully every page in the story of war would be left\r\nblank, or printed black, with only fine white letters in the\r\ndarkness to mark the efforts for humanity, which war can never\r\nwholly suppress.\r\n\r\nIn this paper I propose to consider only economic effects of\r\nthis war and with special reference to the great industry which\r\nbrings most of this audience together, the business of\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nThe great war debts of the nations of Europe began with\r\nrepresentative government. Kings borrowed money when they\r\ncould, bankrupting themselves at intervals and sometimes\r\nwrecking their nations. Kings have always been uncertain pay.\r\nNot many loaned money to them willingly and only in small\r\namounts and at usurious rates of interest. To float a\r\n\"patriotic loan,\" it was often necessary to make use of the\r\nprison or the rack. With the advent of parliaments and chambers\r\nof deputies, the credit of nations improved and it became easy\r\nto borrow money. There was developed a special class of\r\nfinanciers, the Rothschilds at their head, pawnbrokers rather\r\nthan bankers, men able and willing to take a whole nation into\r\npawn. And with the advent of great loans, as Goldwin Smith\r\nwisely observed, \"there was removed the last check on war.\"\r\n\r\nWith better social and business adjustments, and especially\r\nwith the progress of railways and steam navigation with other\r\napplications of science to personal and national interests, the\r\nprocess of borrowing became easier, as also the payment of\r\ninterest on which borrowing depends. Hence more borrowing,\r\nalways the easiest solution of any financial complication or\r\nembarrassment. Through the substitution of regular methods of\r\ntaxation for the collection of tribute, the nations became\r\nsolidified. Only a solidified nation can borrow money. The\r\nloose and lawless regions called Kingdoms and Empires under\r\nfeudalism were not nations at all. A nation is a region in\r\nwhich the people are normally at peace among themselves. In\r\ncivil war, a nation's existence may be dissolved.\r\n\r\nIn all the ages war costs all that it can. All that can be\r\nextorted or borrowed is cast into the melting pot, for the sake\r\nof self-preservation or for the sake of victory. If the nations\r\nhad any more to give war would demand it. The king could\r\nextort, but there are limits to extortion. The nation could\r\nborrow, and to borrowing there is but one limit, that of actual\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Bell, cashier of Lloyd's Bank in London, said in 1913:\r\n\r\n'The London bankers are not lending on the continent any more.\r\nWe can see already the handwriting on the wall and that spells\r\nREPUDIATION. The people of Europe will say: \"We know that we\r\nhave had all this money and that we ought to pay interest on\r\nit. But we must live; and we can not live and pay.\"'\r\n\r\nThe chief motive for borrowing on the part of every nation has\r\nbeen war or preparation for war. If it were not for war no\r\nnation on earth need ever have borrowed a dollar. If provinces\r\nand municipalities could use all the taxes their people pay,\r\nfor purposes of peace, they could pay off all their debts and\r\nstart free. In Europe, for the last hundred years, in time of\r\nso-called peace, nations have paid more for war than for\r\nanything else. It is not strange therefore that this armed\r\npeace has \"found its verification in war.\" It has been the \"Dry\r\nWar,\" the \"Race for the Abyss,\" which the gray old strategists\r\nof the general staff have brought to final culmination.\r\n\r\nThe debt of Great Britain began with the revolution of 1869,\r\nwith about $1,250,000. This unpopular move, known as Dutch\r\nfinance, was the work of William of Orange. Other loans\r\nfollowed, based on customs duties with \"taxes on bachelors,\r\nwidows, marriages and funerals,\" and the profits on lotteries.\r\nAt the end of the war of the revolution the debt reached\r\n$1,250,000,000, and with the gigantic borrowings of Pitt, in\r\nthe interest of the overthrow of Napoleon, the debt reached its\r\nhighest point, $4,430,000,000. The savings of peace duly\r\nreduced this debt, but the Boer war, for which about\r\n$800,000,000 was borrowed, swept these savings away. When the\r\npresent war began the national debt had been reduced to a\r\nlittle less than $400,000,000 which sum a year of world war has\r\nbrought up to $10,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe debt of France dates from the French Revolution. Through\r\nreckless management it soon rose to $700,000,000, which sum was\r\ncut by paper money, confiscation and other repudiations to\r\n$160,000,000. This process of easing the government at the\r\nexpense of the people spread consternation and bankruptcy far\r\nand wide. A great program of public expenditure following the\r\ncostly war and its soon repaid indemnity raised the debt of\r\nFrance to over $6,000,000,000. The interest alone amounted to\r\nnearly $1,000,000,000. A year of the present war has brought\r\nthis debt to the unheard of figure of about $11,000,000,000.\r\nThus nearly two million bondholders and their families in and\r\nout of France have become annual pensioners on the public\r\npurse, in addition to all the pensioners produced by war.\r\n\r\nGermany is still a very young nation and as an empire more\r\nthrifty than her largest state. The imperial debt was in 1908 a\r\nlittle over $1,000,000,000. The total debt of the empire and\r\nthe states combined was about $4,000,000,000 at the outbreak of\r\nthe war. It is now stated at about $9,000,000,000, a large part\r\nof the increase being in the form of \"patriotic\" loans from\r\nhelpless corporations.\r\n\r\nThe small debt of the United States rose after the Civil War to\r\n$2,773,000,000. It has been reduced to about $915,000,000,\r\nproportionately less than in any other civilized nation. The\r\nlocal debts of states and municipalities in this and other\r\ncountries are, however, very large and are steadily rising. As\r\nMr. E. S. Martin observes,\r\n\r\n'We have long since passed the simple stage of living beyond\r\nour incomes. We are engaged in living beyond the incomes of\r\ngenerations to come.'\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate by a supposititious example. A nation has an\r\nexpenditure of $100,000,000 a year. It raises the sum by\r\ntaxation of some sort and thus lives within its means. But\r\n$100,000,000 is the interest on a much larger sum, let us say\r\n$2,500,000,000. If instead of paying out a hundred million year\r\nby year for expenses, we capitalize it, we may have immediately\r\nat hand a sum twenty-five times as great. The interest on this\r\nsum is the same as the annual expense account. Let us then\r\nborrow $2,500,000,000 on which the interest charges are\r\n$100,000,000 a year. But while paying these charges the nation\r\nhas the principal to live on for a generation. Half of it will\r\nmeet current expenses for a dozen years, and the other half is\r\nat once available for public purposes, for dockyards, for\r\nwharves, for fortresses, for public buildings and, above all,\r\nfor the ever-growing demands of military conscription and of\r\nnaval power. Meanwhile the nation is not standing still. In\r\nthese twelve years the progress of invention and of commerce\r\nmay have doubled the national income. There is then still\r\nanother $100,000,000 yearly to be added to the sum available\r\nfor running expenses. This again can be capitalized, another\r\n$2,500,000,000 can be borrowed, not all at once perhaps, but\r\nwith due regard to the exigencies of banking and the temper of\r\nthe people. With repeated borrowings the rate of taxation\r\nrises. Living on the principal sets a new fashion in\r\nexpenditure. The same fashion extends throughout the body\r\npolitic. Individuals, corporations, municipalities all live on\r\ntheir principal.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of railways and other public utilities by the\r\ngovernment tends further to complicate the problems of national\r\ndebt. It is clear that this system of buying without paying can\r\nnot go on forever. The growth of wealth and population can not\r\nkeep step with borrowing, even though all funds were expended\r\nfor the actual needs of society. Of late years, war preparation\r\nhas come to take the lion's share of all funds, however\r\ngathered, \"consuming the fruits of progress.\" What the end\r\nshall be, and by what forces it will be brought about, no one\r\ncan now say. This is still a very rich world, even though\r\ninsolvent and under control of its creditors. There is a\r\ngrowing unrest among taxpayers. There would be a still greater\r\nunrest if posterity could be heard from, for it can only save\r\nitself by new inventions and new exploitations or by frugality\r\nof administration of which no nation gives an example to-day.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this burden of past debt, with all its many\r\nramifications and its interest charges, is not the heaviest the\r\nnations have placed on themselves. The annual cost of army and\r\nnavy in the world before the war was about double the sum of\r\ninterest paid on the bonded debt. This annual sum represented\r\npreparation for future war, because in the intricacies of\r\nmodern warfare \"hostilities must be begun\" long before the\r\nmaterialization of any enemy. In estimating the annual cost of\r\nwar, to the original interest of upwards of $1,500,000,000 we\r\nmust add yearly about $2,500,000,000 of actual expenditure for\r\nfighters, guns and ships. We must further consider the generous\r\nallowance some nations make for pensions. A large and\r\nunestimated sum may also be added to the account from loss of\r\nmilitary conscription, again not counting the losses to society\r\nthrough those forms of poverty which have their primal cause in\r\nwar. For in the words of Bastiat, \"War is an ogre that devours\r\nas much when he sleeps as when he is awake.\" It was Gambetta\r\nwho foretold that the final end of armament rivalry must be \"a\r\nbeggar crouching by a barrack door.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the great war began, the nations of Europe were thus waist\r\ndeep in debt, the total amount of national bonded indebtedness\r\nbeing about $30,000,000,000, or nearly three times the total\r\nsum of actual gold and silver, coined or not in all the world.\r\nA year of war at the rate of $50,000,000 to $70,000,000 per day\r\nhas increased this indebtedness to nearly $50,000,000,000, the\r\nbonds themselves rated at half or less their normal value,\r\nwhile the actual financial loss through destruction of life and\r\nproperty has been estimated at upwards of $40,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Unseen Empire,\" the forceful and prophetic drama of Mr.\r\nAtherton Brownell, the American ambassador, Stephan Channing,\r\ntries to show the chancellor of Germany that war with Great\r\nBritain is not a \"good business proposition.\" He says:\r\n\r\n'Our Civil War has cost us to date, if you count pensions for\r\nthe wrecks it left--mental and physical--nearly twenty billions\r\nof dollars. And that doesn't include property losses, nor\r\ndestruction of trade, nor broken hearts and desolate\r\nhomes--that's just cold hard cash that we have actually paid\r\nout. You can't even think it. There have been only about one\r\nbillion minutes since Christ was born. Now if there had been\r\nfour million slaves and we had bought every one of them at an\r\naverage of one thousand dollars apiece, set them free and had\r\nno war, we should have been in pocket to day just sixteen\r\nbillion dollars. That one crime cost us in cash just about the\r\nequal of sixteen dollars a minute from the beginning of the\r\nChristian era.'\r\n\r\nThe war as forecast in the play is now on in fact, and one\r\ncertain truth in regard to it is that it is assuredly not \"a\r\ngood business proposition\" for anybody in any nation, excepting\r\nof course, the makers of the instruments of death.\r\n\r\nDAILY COST OF GREAT EUROPEAN WAR (Charles Richet, 1912)\r\n\r\nFeed of men. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $12,600,000\r\nFeed of horses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000,000\r\nPay (European rates) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,250,000\r\nPay of workmen in the arsenals and ports (100 per day)1,000,000\r\nTransportation (60 miles in 10 days) . . . . . . 2,100,000\r\nTransportation for provisions. . . . . . . . . . 4,200,000\r\nMunitions: Infantry 10 cartridges a day. . . . . 4,200,000\r\nArtillery: 10 shots per day. . . . . . . . . . . 1,200,000\r\nMarine: 2 shots per day. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 400,000\r\nEquipment. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,200,000\r\nAmbulances: 500,000 wounded or ill ($1 per day). . 500,000\r\nWar ships. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500,000\r\nReduction of imports . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,000,000\r\nHelp to the poor (20 cents per day to 1 in 10) . 6,800,000\r\nDestruction of towns, etc. . . . . . . . . . . . 2,000,000\r\nTotal per day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$49,950,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual war began, in accord with Professor Richet's\r\ncalculation, at a cost of $50,000,000 per day. Previous to this\r\nthe \"dry war\" or \"armed peace\" cost only $10,000,000 per day.\r\nThis is Richet's calculation in 1912, an underestimate as to\r\nexpenses on the sea and in the air. These with the growing\r\nscarcity of bread and shrapnel, the equipment of automobiles,\r\nand the unparalleled ruin of cities have raised this cost to\r\n$70,000,000 per day.\r\n\r\nThis again takes no account of the waste of men and horses,\r\nless costly than the other material of war and not necessarily\r\nreplaced. All this is piled on top of \"the endless caravan of\r\nciphers\" ($30,000,000,000), which represents the accumulated\r\nand unpaid war debt of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWar is indeed the sport for kings, but it is no sport for the\r\npeople who pay and die, and in the long run the workers of the\r\nworld must pay the cost of it. As Benjamin Franklin observed:\r\n\r\n'War is not paid for in war time) the bill comes later.'\r\n\r\nAnd what a bill!\r\n\r\nYves Guyot, the French economist, estimates that the first six\r\nmonths of war cost western Europe in cash $5,400,000,000, to\r\nwhich should be added further destruction estimated at\r\n$11,600,000,000, making a total of $17,000,000,000. The entire\r\namount of coin in the world is less than $12,000,000,000. Edgar\r\nCrammond, secretary of the Liverpool Stock Exchange, another\r\nhigh authority, estimates the cash cost of a year of war, to\r\nAugust 1, 1915, at $17,000,000,000, while other losses will\r\nmount up to make a grand total of $46,000,000,000. Mr. Crammond\r\nestimates that the cost to Great Britain for a year of war will\r\nreach $3,500,000,000. This sum is about equivalent to the\r\naccumulated war debt of Great Britain for a hundred years\r\nbefore the war. The war debt of Germany (including Prussia) is\r\nnow about the same.\r\n\r\nNo one can have any conception of what $46,000,000,000 may be.\r\nIt is four times all the gold and silver in the world. It\r\nrepresents, it is stated, about 100,000 tons of gold, and would\r\nprobably outweigh the Washington monument. We have no data as\r\nto what monuments weigh, but we may try a few other\r\ncalculations. If this sum were measured out in $20 gold pieces\r\nand they were placed side by side on the railway track, on each\r\nrail, they would line with gold every line from New York to the\r\nPacific Ocean, and there would be enough left to cover each\r\nrail of the Siberian railway from Vladivostock to Petrograd.\r\nThere would still be enough left to rehabilitate Belgium and to\r\nbuy the whole of Turkey, at her own valuation, wiping her\r\nfinally from the map.\r\n\r\nOr we may figure in some other fashion. The average working man\r\nin America earns $518 per year. It would take ninety million\r\nyears' work to pay the cost of the war; or ninety million\r\nAmerican laborers might pay it off in one year, if all their\r\nliving expenses were paid. The working men of Europe receive\r\nfrom half to a third the wages in America. They are the ones\r\nwho have this bill to pay.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a year of the great war is a little greater than\r\nthe estimated value of all the property of the United States\r\nwest of Chicago. It is nearly equal to the total value of all\r\nthe property in Germany ($48,000,000,000) as figured in 1906.\r\nThe whole Russian Empire ($35,000,000,000) could have been\r\nbought for a less sum before the war began. It could be had on\r\na cash sale for half that now. It would have paid for all the\r\nproperty in Italy ($13,000,000,000); Japan ($10,000,000,000);\r\nHolland ($5,000,000,000); Belgium ($7,000,000,000); Spain\r\n($6,000,000,000) and Portugal ($2,500,000,000). It is three\r\ntimes the entire yearly earnings in wages and salaries of the\r\npeople of the United States ($15,500,000,000).\r\n\r\nWe could go on indefinitely with this, playing with figures\r\nwhich nobody can understand, for the greatest fortune ever\r\naccumulated by man, in whatever fashion, would not pay for\r\nthree days of this war.\r\n\r\nThe cost of this war would pay the national debts of all the\r\nnations in the world at the time the war broke out, and this\r\naggregate sum of $45,000,000,000 for the world was all\r\naccumulated in the criminal stupidity of the wars of the\r\nnineteenth century. If all the farms, farming lands, and\r\nfactories of the United States were wiped out of existence, the\r\ncost of this war would more than replace them. If all the\r\npersonal and real property of half our nation were destroyed,\r\nor if an earthquake of incredible dimensions should shake down\r\nevery house from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the waste would\r\nbe less than that involved in this war. And an elemental\r\ncatastrophe leaves behind it no costly legacy of hate; even the\r\nfinancial troubles are not ended with the treaty of peace. The\r\ncredit of Europe is gone for one does not know how long. Before\r\nthe war, it is said, there were $200,000,000,000 in bonds and\r\nstocks in circulation in Europe. Much of this has been sold for\r\nwhatever it would bring. Some of the rest is worth its face\r\nvalue Some of it is worth nothing. In the final adjustment who\r\ncan know whether he is a banker or a beggar?\r\n\r\nThe American Ambassador was quite within bounds when he said:\r\n\"There isn't so much money in the world; you can't even think\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nOr we may calculate (with Dr. Edward T. Devine) in a totally\r\ndifferent way. The cost of this war would have covered every\r\nmoral social, economic and sanitary reform ever asked for in\r\nthe civilized world, in so far as money properly expended can\r\ncompass such results. It could eliminate infectious disease,\r\nfeeble-mindedness, the slums and the centers of vice. It could\r\nprovide adequate housing, continuity of labor, insurance\r\nagainst accident; in other words it could abolish almost every\r\nkind of suffering due to outside influences and not inherent in\r\nthe character of the person concerned.\r\n\r\nA Russian writer, quoted by Dr. John H. Finley, puts this idea\r\nin a different form:\r\n\r\n'Our most awful enemies, the elements and germs and insect\r\ndestroyers, attack us every minute without cease, yet we murder\r\none another as if we were out of our senses. Death is ever on\r\nthe watch for us, and we think of nothing but to snatch a few\r\npatches of land! About 5,000,000,000 days of work go every year\r\nto the displacement of boundary lines. Think of what humanity\r\ncould obtain if that prodigious effort were devoted to fighting\r\nour real enemies, the noxious species and our hostile\r\nenvironment. We should conquer them in a few years. The entire\r\nglobe would turn into a model farm. Every plant would grow for\r\nour use. The savage animals would disappear, and the infinitely\r\ntiny animals would be reduced to impotence by hygiene and\r\ncleanliness. The earth would be conducted according to our\r\nconvenience. In short, the day men realize who their worst\r\nenemies are, they will form an alliance against them, they will\r\ncease to murder one another like wild beasts from sheer folly.\r\nThen they will be the true rulers of the planet, the lords of\r\ncreation.'\r\n\r\nSays Robert L. Duffus:\r\n\r\n'Money spent in warfare is not like spending money in other\r\nindustries. It will bring far more beastliness, far more\r\ninjustice, far more tyranny, far more danger to all that is\r\nhonorable, generous and noble in the world, far more grief and\r\nrage than money spent in any other way. Not one per cent. of\r\nthe amount devoted to these purposes, is, for the end aimed at,\r\nwasted.'\r\n\r\nIt is said that the main cause of the war lay in the envy of\r\nGerman commerce by British rivals. This is assuredly not true.\r\nBut if it were, let us look at the business side of it. Taking\r\nthe net profits of over-seas trade as stated two years ago by\r\nthe Hamburg-American Company, the strongest in the world, and\r\nestimating the rest, we have something like this:\r\n\r\nDuring the \"Dry War\" the net earnings of the German Mercantile\r\nfleet was about one third the cost of the navy supposed to\r\nprotect it. It would take seventy years of trade, on the scale\r\nof the last year before the war, to repay Germany's expenses\r\nfor a year of war. To make good all the losses of Europe would\r\nrequire more than one hundred years of the over-seas trading\r\nprofits of all the world. War is therefore death to trade, as\r\nit is to every other agency of civilization.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war the value of stocks and bonds in\r\ncirculation in Europe amounted to about $200,000,000,000. What\r\nis the present value of all these certificates of ownership?\r\nWhat is the present value of any particular industrial plant or\r\ncommercial venture?\r\n\r\nA friend in London had inherited through his German wife a\r\nlarge aniline dye plant on the Rhine. He told me recently that\r\nhe had not heard one word from it for six months. What will be\r\nits value when he hears from it? And what certainty has he as\r\nto its ownership?\r\n\r\nIs it true that this war is the outcome of commercial jealousy?\r\nLet us look at this for a moment. The two greatest shipping\r\ncompanies in the world before the war were the Hamburg-American\r\nCompany and the Nord-Deutscher Lloyd of Bremen. These companies\r\nhad grown strong because they deserved to grow. They had\r\nattended to their affairs both in shipment of freight and\r\ntransportation of passengers with that minute attention to\r\ndetails which is so large an element in German success. The\r\ngrowth of these companies arose through American trade and\r\nespecially through trade with Great Britain and the British\r\npossessions. Did they clamor for war--a war, whatever else\r\nmight result, sure to cripple their trade for a generation. It\r\nis said that Ballin, of the Hamburg Company, unable to prevent\r\nGreat Britain from rising to the defense of Belgium \"went home\r\nbroken-hearted.\" Did Ballin build the great Imperator, costing\r\nnine million--six million of it borrowed money--with a view of\r\nlaying her off after a few trips for an indefinite period in\r\nHamburg? Did the Nord-Deutscher Lloyd contemplate leaving the\r\nVaterland and the George Washington to lie in Hoboken till they\r\nwere sold for harbor dues?\r\n\r\nNor was the jealousy on the other side. The growth of German\r\ncommerce concerned mainly Great Britain. Presumably it was\r\nprofitable on both sides, for all trade is barter. In any\r\nevent, Great Britain has never raised a tariff wall against it,\r\nnever protected her traders by a single differential duty. She\r\nhas risen above the idea that by tariff exactions the\r\nforeigners can be made to pay the sages. As for envy of German\r\ncommerce, who ever heard of an Englishman who envied anybody\r\nanything?\r\n\r\nAgain, did the Cunard Company build her three great steamships,\r\nthe Mauretania, the Lusitania, the Aquitania for the fate which\r\nhas come to them? In 1914 I saw the great Aquitania, finest of\r\nall floating palaces, tied by the nose to the wharf at\r\nLiverpool, the most sheepish-looking steamship I ever saw\r\nanywhere. Out of her had been taken $1,250,000 worth of plate\r\nglass and plush velvet, elevators and lounging rooms, the\r\nrequirements of the tender rich in their six days upon the sea.\r\nThe whole ship was painted black, filled with coal--to be sent\r\nout to help the warships at sea. And for this humble service I\r\nam told she proved unfitted.\r\n\r\nNo, commercial envy is not a reason, rivalry in business is not\r\na reason, need of expansion is not a reason. These are excuses\r\nonly, not causes of war. There is no money in war. There is no\r\nchance of highway robbery in the byways of history which can\r\nrepay anything tangible of the expense of the expedition. The\r\ngray old strategists do not care for this. It is fair to them\r\nto say they are not sordid. They care no more for the financial\r\nexhaustion of a nation than for the slaughter of its young men.\r\n\"An old soldier like me,\" said Napoleon, \"does not care a\r\ntinker's damn for the death of a million men.\" Neither does he\r\ncare for the collapse of a million industrial corporations.\r\n\r\nOf the many forms of business and financial relation among men,\r\nnone is more important than those included under the name of\r\ninsurance. Insurance is a form of mutual help. By its influence\r\nthe effects of calamity are spread so widely that they cease to\r\nbe felt as calamity. The fact of death can not be set aside,\r\nbut through insurance it need not appear as economic disaster,\r\nonly as personal loss. Its essential nature is that of social\r\ncooperation and it furnishes some of the most effective of\r\nbonds which knit society together. As insurance has become\r\nalready an international function, its influence should be felt\r\ncontinuously on the side of peace. That it is so felt is the\r\njustification of our meeting together to-day, as underwriters\r\nof insurance and as workers for peace. The essence of\r\ninsurance, as Professor Royce observes, is that\r\n\r\n'it is a principle at once peace-making in its general tendency\r\nand business-like in its practicable special application.... As\r\na result of insurance, men gradually find themselves involved\r\nin a social network of complicated but beneficent relations of\r\nwhich individuals are usually very imperfectly aware but by\r\nmeans of which modern society has been profoundly transformed.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFor life insurance, in general, is not personally selfish in\r\nits motive. It is essentially altruistic, the effort of the\r\nbenefit of some person beloved who is designated as the\r\nbeneficiary. For the benefit of this surviving person, the\r\nefforts involved in the payment of premiums are put forth, and\r\nthe insurance companies and their underwriters constitute the\r\nmachinery by which this unification is given to society.\r\n\r\nTo all the interests of insurance, the lawlessness of war is\r\nwholly adverse and destructive. Insurance involves mutual trust\r\nand trust thrives under security of person and property.\r\nInsurance demands steadiness of purpose and continuity of law.\r\nIn war, all laws are silent. War is the brutish, blind, denial\r\nof law, only admissible when all other honorable alternatives\r\nhave been withdrawn--the last resort of \"murdered, mangled\r\nliberty.\"\r\n\r\nIn its direct relation, war destroys those who to the\r\nunderwriter represent the \"best risks,\" the men most valuable\r\nto themselves and thus most valuable to the community. Those\r\nwhom war leaves behind, to slip along the lines of least\r\nresistance into the city slums, are the people insurance rarely\r\nreaches. War confuses administration of insurance. Policies, in\r\nwar time, can be written only on a sliding scale. This greatly\r\nincreases the premium by reducing the final payments. Increase\r\nof rate of premium must decrease business. War means financial\r\nanarchy, inflated currency and depreciation of bonds. A\r\ncurrency which fluctuates demoralizes all business and war\r\nleaves no alternative. The slogan \"business as usual\" in war\r\ntime deceives nobody. If it did, nobody would gain by the\r\ndeception. Enforced loans from the reserve fund of insurance\r\ncompanies to the state mean the depreciation of reserves. The\r\nsubstitution of unstable government bonds means robbery of the\r\nbond holders. The yielding to the state, by enforced \"voluntary\r\naction,\" of reserves of savings banks and insurance companies\r\nrepresents a form of state robbery. This is now in practice on\r\nthe continent of Europe. Such funds are probably never actually\r\nconfiscated but held in abeyance until the close of the war.\r\nThis is another form of the everpresent \"military necessity,\"\r\nwhich seizes men's property with little more compunction than\r\nit shows in seizing men's bodies. War conditions mean\r\ninsecurity of investment. In war, all bonds are liable to\r\nbecome \"scraps of paper,\" and no fund can be made safe. The\r\ninsurance investments in Europe have been enormously depleted\r\nin worth, a reduction in market value estimated at 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nExperts in insurance tell me that in war time certain policies\r\nare written so as to be scaled down automatically when the\r\nholder goes under the colors. Some are invalid in time of war,\r\nand some have the clause of free travel greatly abridged. A few\r\nare written to apply to all conditions, but on these the rates\r\nof premiums would naturally increase. Companies generally\r\nrefuse to pay under conditions not nominated in the bond, and\r\nin general all policies are automatically reduced to level of\r\nwar policies when war begins.\r\n\r\nI am told that some American companies issue group policies as\r\nfor any or all of a thousand men, these not subject to a\r\nphysical examination. The war claims in Great Britain have been\r\nvery heavy, because such a large proportion of clerks,\r\nartisans, students and other insurable or well-paid men have\r\nbeen first to volunteer. Some insurance companies have been\r\nmuch embarrassed by the general enlistment of their employees.\r\n\r\nIn fire insurance, conditions are much the same. All contracts\r\nin foreign nations are held in abeyance until the close of war.\r\nSuch companies doing business in America are now mostly\r\nincorporated as American.\r\n\r\nIn every regard, the business of insurance is naturally allied\r\nwith the forces that make for peace. War brings ruin, through\r\nincrease of loans, through the exhaustion of reserves and the\r\nprecarious nature of investment. The same remark applies in\r\nsome degree to every honorable or constructive business. If any\r\nother form of danger threatened a great industry, its leaders\r\nwould be on the alert. They would spare no money and leave no\r\nstone unturned for their own protection.\r\n\r\nTowards war, business has always shown a stupid fatalism. War\r\nhas been thought \"inevitable,\" coming of itself at intervals\r\nwith nobody responsible.\r\n\r\nThere could not be a greater error. War does not come of\r\nitself, nor without great and persistent preparation. A few\r\nhundred resolute men, bent on war, led by unscrupulous leaders\r\nbrought on this war. The military group of one nation plays\r\ninto the hands of like groups in other nations. To keep up war\r\nagitation long enough, whether the cause be real or imaginary,\r\nseems to hypnotize the public mind. The horrors of war\r\nfascinate rather than repel, and thousands of men in this land\r\nof peace are ready to fight in Europe to one who dreamed of\r\nsuch a line of action a year or two ago.\r\n\r\n\"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\" The interests\r\ninvolved should put honest business on its guard. The insurance\r\nmen could afford to maintain a thousand observers, men wise in\r\nbusiness as well as in International Law, and in the manners\r\nand customs of the people of the world. A few dozen skilful\r\npolitico-military detectives--men like W. J. Burns for example\r\nemployed in the interest of finance might save finance a\r\nbillion dollars. These should watch the standing incentives to\r\nwar. Such men should stand guard against the influences that\r\nwork toward conflict. Those who work for peace should be not\r\n\"firemen to be called in to put out the fire\" already started\r\nthrough the negligence of business men but agents for\r\n\"fireproof building material\" in our national edifice, to stand\r\nat all times for the security of business, the sanctity of law,\r\norder and peace. This kind of \"preparedness for war\" would\r\ninvolve no risks of conflict, of victory or defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE STARS AND THE FORMATION OF THE EARTH. II\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM WALLACE CAMPBELL\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR OF THE LICK OBSERVATORY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF SEQUENCE PROPOSED\r\n\r\nTHERE are several lines of evidence in support of the order of\r\nevolution which we have outlined.\r\n\r\n1. The close relationship of the bright-line nebular spectrum,\r\nthe bright-line stellar spectrum and the spectra of the\r\nsimplest helium stars; the practically continuous sequence of\r\nspectra from the helium stars to the red stars.\r\n\r\n2. In the long run, we must expect the stars to grow colder, at\r\nleast as to the surface strata. What the average interior\r\ntemperatures are is another question; the highest interior\r\ntemperatures are thought to be reached at an intermediate or\r\nquite late stage in the process, in accordance with principles\r\ninvestigated by Lane and others; but the temperatures existing\r\nin the deep interiors seem to have little direct influence in\r\ndefining the spectral characters of the stars, which are\r\nconcerned more directly with the surface strata.[1] We should\r\ntherefore expect the simpler types of spectra, such as we find\r\nin the helium and hydrogen stars, in the early stages of the\r\nevolutionary process. The complicated spectra of the metals,\r\nand particularly the oxides of the metals, should be in\r\nevidence late in stellar life, when the atmospheres of the\r\nstars have become denser and colder.\r\n\r\n[1] This important point seems not to have been realized by all\r\ntheorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The velocities of the Orion nebula, the Trifid nebula, the\r\nCarina nebula, and of several other irregular nebulae, have\r\nbeen measured with the spectroscope. These bodies seem to be\r\nnearly at rest with reference to the stellar system. The helium\r\nstars have the lowest-known stellar velocities, and the average\r\nvelocities of the stars are higher and higher as we pass from\r\nthe helium stars, through the hydrogen and solar stars, up to\r\nthe red stars. The average velocities of the brighter stars of\r\nthe different spectral classes, as determined with the D. O.\r\nMills spectrographs at Mount Hamilton and in Chile, are as in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\nSpectral No. of  Class    Stars    Average Velocity in Space\r\n   B                       225         12.9 km. per Sec.\r\n   A                       177         21.9\r\n   F                       185         28.7\r\n   G                       128         29.9\r\n   E                       382         33.6\r\n   M                        73         34.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can not place the irregular nebulae after the red stars:\r\ntheir velocities are too small, and their spectra have no\r\nresemblances to the red-star spectra.\r\n\r\n4. Wherever we find large irregular gaseous nebulae we find\r\nstars in the early subdivisions of the helium group. They are\r\nclosely related in position. This is true of the Orion and\r\nother similar regions. The irregular, gaseous nebulae are in\r\ngeneral found in and near the Milky Way, and so are the helium\r\nstars. The yellow and red stars, at least the brighter ones, do\r\nnot cluster in nebulous regions.\r\n\r\n5. The stars are more and more uniformly distributed over the\r\nsphere as one goes from the helium stars through the hydrogen\r\nand solar stars, to the red stars. The Class M stars show\r\nlittle or no preference for the Milky Way. Of course, I am\r\nspeaking here of the brighter and nearer stars which we have\r\nbeen able to study by means of the spectroscope, and not at all\r\nof the faint stars which form the unstudied distant parts of\r\nthe Milky Way structure. The helium stars are young, their\r\nmotions are slow, and they have not wandered far from the place\r\nof their birth. Not so with the older stars.\r\n\r\n6. The visual double stars afford strong evidence that the\r\norder of evolution described is correct. The 36-inch refractor\r\nhas shown that one star in 18, on the average, brighter than\r\nthe ninth visual magnitude, consists of two or more suns which\r\nwe can not doubt are in slow revolution around each other. The\r\nnumber of double stars observable would be very much greater\r\nthan this if they were not so far away. Of the 20 stars which\r\nwe say are our nearest neighbors, 8 are well known double\r\nstars; one double in each two and one half, on the average.\r\nAitken has made a specialty of observing the double stars whose\r\ncomponents in each case are very close together and are in\r\ncomparatively rapid revolution. His program includes 164 such\r\nsystems whose types of spectra are known, as in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n Spectrum       Number of Double Stars\r\nBright-line            0\r\nClass B                4\r\nClass A-F            131\r\nClass G-N             28\r\nClass M-N?             1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe message which this table brings is clear. The double stars\r\nwhose spectra are of the Bright-Line and Class B varieties have\r\ntheir components so close together that only 4, of Class B, are\r\nvisible. The great majority fall in Classes A to K; 159 out of\r\n164. The component stars in these classes are far enough apart\r\nto be visible in the telescopes, and yet are close enough to be\r\nrevolving in periods reasonably short. In the Class M double\r\nstars, this program contains not more than one star, and I\r\nbelieve the explanation is this: double stars of Class M are in\r\ngeneral so far apart, and therefore their periods of revolution\r\nare so long, that they do not get upon programs of rapidly\r\nrevolving stars. Also, the fainter components in many red stars\r\nmust have cooled off so far that they are invisible. The\r\ndistances between the components of visual double stars are in\r\ngeneral the greater as we proceed from the helium stars through\r\nthe various spectral classes up to Class M. There are reasons\r\nfor believing that two stars revolving around their center of\r\nmass have gradually increased their distance apart, and\r\ntherefore their revolution period. If this is true, the Classes\r\nG and K; double stars are effectively older than Classes A and\r\nF double stars, and these in turn are effectively older than\r\nClass B double stars.\r\n\r\n7. The spectrograph has great advantages over the telescope in\r\ndiscovering and observing double stars whose components are\r\nvery close together, by virtue of the facts that the\r\nspectrograph measures, velocities of approach and recession in\r\nabsolute units--so many kilometers per second--and that the\r\nspeeds of rotation in binary systems are higher the closer\r\ntogether the two components are. The observations of the\r\nbrighter helium stars, especially those made at the Yerkes\r\nObservatory by Frost and Adams, have shown that one helium star\r\nin every two and one half on the average is a very close\r\ndouble. In beta Cephei, an early Class B star, the components\r\nare so close that they revolve around each other in 4 1/2\r\nhours; many systems have periods in the neighborhood of a day,\r\nof two days, of three days, and so on. Similar observations\r\nmade with the D. O. Mills spectrographs in both hemispheres\r\nhave shown that about one star in every four of the bright\r\nstars, on the average, is a double star. In general, the\r\nproportion of spectroscopic doubles discovered to date is\r\ngreatest in Class B and decreases as we proceed toward Class M.\r\nThe explanation is simple: in the Class B doubles the\r\ncomponents are close together, their orbital velocities are\r\nvery high and change rapidly, and the spectrograph is able to\r\ndiscover the variations with little loss of time. As we pass\r\ntoward the yellow and red spectroscopic binaries we find the\r\ncomponents separated more and more, the orbital velocities are\r\nsmaller and the periods longer, the variations of velocity are\r\nmore difficult to discover, and in the wider pairs we must wait\r\nmany years before the variations become appreciable. There is a\r\nvery marked progression of the average lengths of periods of\r\nthe spectrographic double stars as we pass from the Class B to\r\nthe Class M pairs. Similarly, the eccentricities of the orbits\r\nof the binaries increase as we proceed in the same direction.\r\nAccumulating evidence is to the effect that the proportion of\r\ndouble stars to single stars may be as great in the Classes A\r\nto K as in Class B.\r\n\r\n8. Kapteyn believes that he is able to divide the individual\r\nstars--those whose proper motions are known--into the two star\r\nstreams which he has described; and he finds that the first\r\nstream is rich in the early blue stars, less rich relatively in\r\nyellow stars, and poor in red stars, whereas the second stream\r\nis very poor in early blue stars, rich in yellows, and\r\nrelatively very rich in reds. His interpretation is that the\r\nstream-one stars are effectively younger than the stream-two\r\nstars, on the whole. Stream one still abounds in youthful\r\nstars: they grow older and the yellow and red stars will then\r\npredominate. Stream two abounds in stars which were once young,\r\nbut are now middle-aged and old.\r\n\r\nThe eight lines of argument outlined are in harmony to the\r\neffect that there is a sequence of development from nebulae to\r\nred stars.\r\n\r\nThe extremely red stars are all faint, only a very few being\r\nvisible to the naked eye, and these near the limit of vision.\r\nOur knowledge concerning them is relatively limited. That\r\nthese, and all stars, will become invisible to our telescopes,\r\nand ultimately be dark unshining bodies, is the logical\r\nconclusion to which the evolutionary processes will lead. As I\r\nhave already stated, both Newcomb and Kelvin were inclined to\r\nbelieve that the major part of gravitational matter in the\r\nuniverse is already invisible.\r\n\r\nIt should be said that a few astronomers doubt whether the\r\norder of evolution is so clearly defined as I have outlined it;\r\nin fact, whether we know even the main trend of the\r\nevolutionary process. We occasionally encounter the opinion\r\nthat the subject is still so unsettled as not to let us say\r\nwhether the helium stars are effectively young or the red stars\r\nare effectively old. Lockyer and Russell have proposed\r\nhypotheses in which the order of evolutionary sequence begins\r\nwith comparatively cool red stars and proceeds through the\r\nyellow stars to the very hot blue stars, and thence back\r\nthrough the yellow stars to cool red stars.\r\n\r\nI think the essentially unanimous view of astronomers is to the\r\neffect that the great mass of accumulated evidence favors the\r\norder of evolution which I have described. We are all ready to\r\nadmit that there are apparent exceptions to the simple course\r\nlaid down, but that these exceptions are revolutionary in\r\neffect, and not hopeless of removal, has not yet, in my\r\nopinion, been established.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL CONDITIONS GOVERN APPEARANCES OF SPECTRA\r\n\r\nA question frequently asked is this: if the yellow and red\r\nstars have been developed from the blue stars, why do not the\r\nthousands of lines in the spectra of the yellow and red stars\r\nshow in the spectra of the blue stars? Indeed, why do not the\r\nelements so conspicuously present in the atmosphere of the red\r\nstars show in the spectra of the gaseous nebulae? The answer is\r\nthat the conditions in the nebulae and in the youngest stars\r\nare such that only the SIMPLEST ELEMENTS, like hydrogen and\r\nhelium, and in the nebulae nebulium, which we think are nearest\r\nto the elemental state of matter, seem to be able to form or\r\nexist in them; and the temperature must lower, or other\r\nconditions change to the conditions existing in the older\r\nstars, before what we may call the more complicated elements\r\ncan construct themselves out of the more elemental forms of\r\nmatter. The oxides of titanium and of carbon found in the red\r\nstars, where the surface temperatures must be relatively low,\r\nwould dissociate themselves into more elemental components and\r\nlose their identity if the temperature and other conditions\r\nwere changed back to those of the early helium stars. Lockyer's\r\nname is closely connected with this phenomenon of dissociation.\r\nThere is no evidence, to the best of my knowledge, that the\r\nelements known in our Earth are not essentially universal in\r\ndistribution, either in the forms which the elements have in\r\nthe Earth, or dissociated into simpler forms wherever the\r\ntemperatures or other conditions make dissociations possible\r\nand unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThe meteorites, which have come through the atmosphere to the\r\nEarth's surface, contain at least 25 known terrestrial\r\nelements. That they have not been found thus far to contain all\r\nof our elements is not surprising, for we should have\r\ndifficulty in finding a piece of our Earth weighing a few\r\nkilograms which would contain 25 of our elements. We have not\r\nfound any elements in meteorites which are unknown to our\r\nchemists. Our comets, which ordinarily show the presence of not\r\nmore than three elements, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, give\r\ncertain evidence of sodium in their composition when they\r\napproach fairly near to the Sun; and the great comet of 1882,\r\nwhen very close to the Sun, developed in its spectrum many\r\nbright lines not previously seen in comet spectra, which\r\nCopeland said were due to iron. That the comets do not show a\r\ngreater number of elements is not in the least surprising: they\r\nare not condensed bodies, and we think that their average\r\ntemperature is low, too low generally to develop the luminous\r\nvapors of the more refractory elements. If their temperatures,\r\napproximated those which exist in the stars, their spectra\r\nwould probably reveal the presence of many of the elements\r\nwhich exist in the meteorites. Of course the proof of this is\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nDESTINY OF THE STELLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\nWe have said that the evolutionary processes depend primarily\r\nupon the loss of heat. This is to the best of our knowledge a\r\ngenuine loss, except as some of the heat rays happen to strike\r\nother celestial bodies. The flow of heat energy from a star\r\nmust be essentially continuous, always in one direction from\r\nhotter bodies to colder bodies, or into so-called unending and\r\nheatless space. Temperatures throughout the universe are\r\napparently moving toward uniformity, at the level of absolute\r\nzero. Now, this uniformity would mean universal stagnation and\r\ndeath. It is possible to have life and to do work only when\r\nthere are differences of temperature between the bodies\r\nconcerned: work is done or accompanied by a flow of heat,\r\nalways from the hotter to the colder body. We are not aware\r\nthat any compensating principle exists. Several students of the\r\nsubject, notably Arrhenius, have searched for such a principle,\r\na fountain of youth so to speak, in accordance with which the\r\nvigor of stellar life should maintain itself from the beginning\r\nof time to the end of time; but I think that nothing\r\napproaching a satisfactory theory has yet been formulated. The\r\nstellar universe seems, from our present point of view, to be\r\nslowly \"running down.\" The processes will not end, however,\r\nwhen all the heat generable WITHIN the stars shall have been\r\nradiated into an endless space. Every body within the universe,\r\nit is conceivable, could have cooled down to absolute zero, but\r\nthe system might still be in its youth. So long as the stars,\r\nwhether intensely hot or free from all heat, are rotating\r\nrapidly on their axes or are rushing through space with high\r\nspeeds, the system will remain VERY MUCH ALIVE. Collisions or\r\nvery close approaches of two stars are bound to occur sooner or\r\nlater, whether the stars are hot or cold, and in all such cases\r\na large share of the kinetic energy--the energy of motion--of\r\nthe two bodies will be converted into heat. A collision, under\r\naverage stellar conditions, should convert the two stars into a\r\nluminous gaseous nebula, or two or more nebulae, which would\r\nrequire hundreds or thousands of millions of years to evolve\r\nagain into young stars, middle-aged stars, old stars, and stars\r\nabsolutely cold. So long as any of these bodies retain motion\r\nwith reference to other bodies, they retain the power of\r\nrebirth and another life. Not to go too far into speculative\r\ndetail, the general effect of these processes would be the\r\ndestruction of relative motions and the gradual decrease in the\r\nnumber of separate bodies, through coalescence. Assume further,\r\nhowever, that all existing bodies, widely scattered through the\r\nstellar system, are absolutely cold and absolutely at rest with\r\nreference to each other: the system might even then be only\r\nmiddle-aged. The mutual gravitations of the bodies would still\r\nbe operative. They would pass each other closely, or collide,\r\nunder high generated velocities: there would be new nebulae,\r\nand new and vigorous stellar life to continue through other\r\nlong ages. The system would not run down until all the kinetic\r\nenergy had been converted into heat, and all the heat generable\r\nhad been dissipated. This would not occur until all material in\r\nthe universe had been combined into one body, or into two\r\nbodies in mutual revolution. However, if there are those who\r\nsay that the universe in action is eternal, through the\r\noperation of compensating principles as yet undiscovered, no\r\nman of science is at present equipped to prove the contrary.\r\n\r\nTHE NOVAE\r\n\r\nThe so-called new stars, otherwise known as temporary stars or\r\nnovae, present interesting considerations. These are stars\r\nwhich suddenly flash out at points where previously no star was\r\nknown to exist; or, in a few cases, where a faint existing star\r\nhas in a few days become immensely brighter. Twenty-nine new\r\nstars have been observed from the year 1572 to date; 19 of them\r\nsince 1886, when the photographic dry plate was applied\r\nsystematically to the mapping of the heavens, and 15 of the 19\r\nstand to the credit of the Harvard observers. This is an\r\naverage of one new star in two years; and as some novae must\r\ncome and go unseen it is evident that they are by no means rare\r\nobjects. Novae pass through a series of evolutions which have\r\nmany points in common; in fact, the ones which have been\r\nextensively studied by photometer and spectrograph have had\r\nhistories with so many identities that we are coming to look\r\nupon them as standard products of evolutionary processes. These\r\nstars usually rise to maximum brilliancy in a few days: some of\r\nthe most noted ones increased in brightness ten-thousand-fold\r\nin two or three days. All of them fluctuate in brightness\r\nirregularly, and usually in short periods of time. Several\r\nnovae have become invisible to the naked eye at the end of a\r\nfew weeks. With two or three exceptions, all have become\r\ninvisible in moderate-sized telescopes, or have become very\r\nfaint, within a few months. Two novae, found very early in\r\ntheir development, had at first dark line spectra, a night\r\nlater bright lines appeared, and a night or two later the\r\nspectra contained the broad radiation and absorption bands\r\ncharacteristic of all recent novae. After the novae become\r\nfairly faint, the bright lines of the gaseous nebula spectrum\r\nare seen for the first time. These lines increase in relative\r\nbrilliancy until the spectra are essentially the same as those\r\nof well-known nebulae, except that the novae lines are broad\r\nwhereas the lines of the nebulae are narrow. In a few months or\r\nyears the nebular lines diminish in brightness, and the\r\ncontinuous spectrum develops. Hartmann at Potsdam, and Adams\r\nand Pease with the 60-inch Mount Wilson reflector, have shown\r\nthat the spectra of the faint remnants of four originally\r\nbrilliant novae now contain some of the bright lines which are\r\ncharacteristic of Wolf-Rayet stars.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] After this lecture was delivered Adams of Mount Wilson\r\nreported that in November, 1914, the chief nebular line (5007A)\r\nand another prominent nebular line (4363A) had entirely\r\ndisappeared from the spectrum of Nova Geminorum No. 2, whereas\r\nthe second nebular line in the green (4959A) remained strong;\r\nprobably a step in progress from the nebular to the Wolf-Rayet\r\nspectrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy the novae suddenly flare up, and what their relations to\r\nother celestial bodies may be, are questions which can not be\r\nregarded as settled. Their distribution on the celestial sphere\r\nis indicated in Figure 25 by the open circles. In this figure\r\nthe densest parts of the Milky Way are drawn in outline. All of\r\nthe novae have appeared in the Milky Way, with the exception of\r\nfive: and these exceptions are worthy of note. One of the five\r\nappeared in the condensed nucleus of the great Andromeda\r\nnebula, not far from its center; another (zeta Centauri) was\r\nlocated close to the edge of a spiral nebula and quite possibly\r\nin a faint outlying part of the nebula; a third (tau Coronae)\r\nwas observed to have a nebulous halo about it at the earliest\r\nstage of its observed existence; a fourth (tau Scorpii)\r\nappeared in a nebula; and the fifth (Nova Ophiuchi No. 2) in\r\n1848 was not extensively observed. The other 24 novae appeared\r\nwithin the structure of the Milky Way. Keeping the story as\r\nshort as possible, a nova is seemingly best explained on the\r\ntheory that a dark or relatively dark star, traveling rapidly\r\nthrough space, has encountered resistance, such as a great\r\nnebula or cloud of particles would afford. While passing\r\nthrough the cloud the forward face of the star is bombarded at\r\nhigh velocities by the resisting materials. The surface strata\r\nbecome heated, the luminosity of the star increases rapidly.\r\nThe effect of the bombardment by small particles can be only\r\nskin deep, and the brightness of the star should diminish\r\nrapidly and therefore the spectrum change speedily from one\r\ntype to another. The new star of February, 1901, in Perseus,\r\nafforded evidence of great strength on this question. Wolf at\r\nHeidelberg photographed in August an irregular nebulous object\r\nnear the nova. Ritchey's photograph of September showed\r\nextensive areas of nebulosity around the star. In October\r\nPerrine and Ritchey discovered that the nebular structure had\r\napparently moved outward from the nova, from September to\r\nOctober. Going back to a March 29th photograph taken for a\r\ndifferent purpose, Perrine found an irregular ring of\r\nnebulosity closely surrounding the star. Apparently, the region\r\nwas full f nebulosity which is normally invisible to us. The\r\nrushing of the star through this resisting medium made the star\r\nthe brightest one in the northern sky for two or three days.\r\nThe great wave of light going out from the star when at its\r\nbrightest traveled in five weeks as far as the ring of\r\nnebulosity, where, falling upon non-luminous nebulous\r\nmaterials, it made the ring visible. Continuing its progress,\r\nthe wave of light illuminated the material which Wolf\r\nphotographed in August, the materials which Ritchey\r\nphotographed still farther away in September, and the still\r\nmore distant materials which Perrine and Ritchey photographed\r\nin October, November, and later. We were able to see this\r\nmaterial only as the very strong wave of light which left the\r\nstar at maximum brightness made the material luminous in\r\npassing. That 24 novae should occur in the Milky Way, where the\r\nstars are most numerous, and where the resisting materials may\r\npreferably prevail, is not surprising; and it should be\r\nrepeated that at least three of the five occurring outside of\r\nthe Milky Way were located in nebulous surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe actual collision of two stars would necessarily be too\r\nviolent in its effect to let the reduction of brilliancy occur\r\nso rapidly as to cause the disappearance of the nova in a few\r\nweeks or months. The close approach of two stars might\r\nconceivably produce the observed facts, but even this process\r\nseems too violent in its probable results. The chances for the\r\ncollision of a rapidly traveling star with an enormously\r\nextended nebulous cloud are vastly greater, and the apparent\r\nmildness of the phenomenon observed is in better harmony with\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nRELATION OF NOVAE, PLANETARY NEBULAE AND WOLF-RAYET STARS\r\n\r\nAlthough all recent novae have been observed to become\r\nplanetary or stellar nebulae, they seem not to remain nebular\r\nfor any length of time; they have gone further and become\r\nWolf-Rayet stars. Whether any or all of the planetary nebulae\r\nthat have been known since Herschel's day, and have remained\r\napparently unchanged in form, have developed from new stars, is\r\nuncertain and doubtful. If they have, the disturbances which\r\ngave them their character must have been violent, such as would\r\nresult from full or glancing collisions of two stars, in order\r\nto produce deep-seated effects which change slowly, rather than\r\nsurface effects which change rapidly.\r\n\r\nWhether the Wolf-Rayet stars have in general been formed from\r\nplanetary nebulae is a different question: some of them\r\ncertainly have. Wright has recently shown that the stellar\r\nnuclei of planetary nebulae are Wolf-Rayet stars, and he has\r\nformulated several steps in the process whereby the nebulosity\r\nin a planetary eventually condenses into the central star. The\r\ndistribution of the planetaries and the Wolf-Rayet stars on the\r\nsphere affords further evidence of a connection. We saw. that\r\nthe novae are nearly all in the Milky Way. The irregular, ring,\r\nplanetary and stellar nebulae, plotted in Fig. 27, prefer the\r\nMilky Way, but not so markedly. The Wolf-Rayets, without\r\nexception, are located in the Milky Way and in the Magellanic\r\nClouds, and those in the Milky Way are remarkably near to its\r\ncentral plane. 107 of these objects are known, 1 is in the\r\nLesser Magellanic Cloud, and 21 are in the Greater Magellanic\r\nCloud. The remaining 85 average less than 2 3/4 degrees from\r\nthe central plane of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nWe are obliged to say that the places of the novae, of the\r\nplanetary and stellar nebulae, and of the Wolf-Rayets in the\r\nevolutionary process are not certainly known. If the Wolf-Rayet\r\nstars have developed from the planetaries, the planetaries from\r\nthe novae, and the novae have resulted from the close approach\r\nor collision of two stars, or from the rushing of a dark or\r\nfaint star through a resisting medium, then the novae,\r\nplanetaries and Wolf-Rayets belong to a new and second\r\ngeneration: they were born under exceptional conditions. The\r\nvelocities of the planetary nebulae seem to be an insuperable\r\ndifficulty in the way of placing them between the irregular\r\nnebulae and the helium stars. The average radial velocity of 47\r\nplanetary nebulae is about 45 km. per second; and, if the\r\nmotions of the planetaries are somewhat at random, their\r\naverage velocities in space are twice as great, or 90 km. per\r\nsecond. This is fully seven times the average velocity of the\r\nhelium stars, and the helium stars in general, therefore, could\r\nnot have come from planetary nebulae. The radial velocities of\r\nonly three Wolf-Rayet stars have been observed, and this number\r\nis too small to have statistical value, but the average for the\r\nthree is several times as high as the average for the helium\r\nstars. We can not say, I think, that the velocities of any\r\nnovae are certainly known.\r\n\r\nIf the planetaries have been formed from novae, especially the\r\nnovae which encountered the fiercest resistance, the high\r\nvelocities are in a sense not surprising, for those stars which\r\ntravel with abnormally high speeds are the ones whose chances\r\nfor collisions with resisting media are best; and, further, the\r\nhigher the speeds of collision the more violent the\r\ndisturbance. This line of argument also leads to the conclusion\r\nthat the novae, planetaries and Wolf-Rayets belong not in\r\ngeneral before the helium stars, but to another generation of\r\nstars. They may, and I think will, develop into a small class\r\nof helium stars having special characteristics; for example,\r\nhigh velocities.\r\n\r\nKANT'S HYPOTHESIS\r\n\r\nImmanuel Kant's writings, published principally in 1755, are in\r\nmany ways the most remarkable contributions to the literature\r\nof stellar evolution yet made. Curiously, Kant's papers have\r\nnot been read by the text-book makers, except in a few cases.\r\nWe have already referred to his ideas on the Milky Way and on\r\ncomets. In his hypothesis of the origin of the solar system, he\r\nlaid emphasis upon the facts that the six known planets revolve\r\naround the Sun from west to east, nearly in the same plane and\r\nnearly in the plane of the Sun's equator; that the then four\r\nknown moons of Jupiter, the five known moons of Saturn, and our\r\nmoon revolve around these planets from west to east, and nearly\r\nin the same general plane; and that the Sun, our moon and the\r\nplanets, so far as known, rotate in the same direction. These\r\nfacts, he said, indicate indisputably a common origin for all\r\nthe members of the solar system. He expressed the belief that\r\nthe materials now composing the solar system were originally\r\nscattered widely throughout the system, and in an elemental\r\nstate. This was a half century before Herschel's extensive\r\nobservations of nebuae. Kant thought of this elemental matter\r\nas cold, endowed with gravitational power, and endowed\r\nnecessarily with some repulsive power, such as exists in gases.\r\nHe started his solar system from materials at rest. Most of the\r\nmatter, he said, drifted to the center to form the Sun. He\r\nbelieved that nuclei or centers of attraction formed here and\r\nthere throughout the chaotic structure, and that in the course\r\nof ages these centers grew by accretion of surrounding matter\r\ninto the present planets and their satellites; and that in some\r\nmanner motion in one direction prevailed throughout the whole\r\nsystem. Kant's explanation of the origin of the ROTATION of the\r\nsolar system is unsound and worthless. We now know that such a\r\ncloud of matter, free from rotation, could not of itself\r\ngenerate rotation; it must get the start from outside forces.\r\nKant's false reasoning was due in part to the fact that some of\r\nour most important dynamical laws were not yet discovered, in\r\npart to his faulty comprehension of certain dynamical\r\nprinciples already known, and probably in part to the\r\nunsatisfactory state of chemical knowledge existing at that\r\ndate. This was half a century before Dalton's atomic theory of\r\nmatter was proposed.\r\n\r\nKant asserted that the processes of combination of surrounding\r\ncold materials would generate heat, and, therefore, that the\r\nresulting planetary masses would assume the liquid form; that\r\nJupiter and Saturn are now in the liquid state; and that all\r\nthe planets will ultimately become cold and solid. This is in\r\nfair agreement with present-day opinion as to the planets, save\r\nthat modern astronomers go further in holding that the outer\r\nstrata of Jupiter and Saturn, likewise of Uranus and Neptune,\r\ndown to a great depth, must still be gaseous. In 1785, after\r\nthe principle of heat liberation attending the compression of a\r\ngas had been announced, Kant supplemented his statement of 1755\r\nas to the origin of the Sun's heat. He attributed this to\r\ngravitational action of the Sun upon its own matter, causing it\r\nto contract in size: he said the quantity of heat generated in\r\na given time would be a function of the Sun's volumes at the\r\nbeginning and at the ending of that period of time. This is\r\nsubstantially the principle which Helmholtz rediscovered and\r\nannounced in 1854, and which is now universally accepted--with\r\nthe reservation of the past ten years, that radioactive\r\nsubstances in the Sun may be an additional factor in the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nKant's paper of 1754 enunciated the theory that the Moon always\r\nturns the same face to the Earth because of tidal retardation\r\nof the Moon's rotation by the Earth's gravitational attraction;\r\nand that our Earth tides produced by the Moon will slow down\r\nthe Earth's rotation until the Earth will finally turn one\r\nhemisphere constantly to the Moon. This principle was in part\r\nreannounced by Laplace a half century later, and likewise\r\ninvestigated by Helmholtz in 1854, before Kant's work was\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nKant's speculations on a possible destruction and re-birth of\r\nthe solar system, on the nature of Saturn's ring, and on the\r\nnature of the zodiacal light are similar in several regards to\r\npresent-day beliefs.\r\n\r\nKant wrote:\r\n\r\n'I seek to evolve the present state of the universe from the\r\nsimplest condition of nature by means of mechanical laws\r\nalone.'\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Sir William Thomson, afterwards Lord Kelvin, commented\r\nthat Kant's\r\n\r\n'attempt to account for the constitution and mechanical origin\r\nof the universe on Newtonian principles only wanted the\r\nknowledge of thermodynamics, which the subsequent experiments\r\nof Davy, Rumford and Joule supplied, to lead to thoroughly\r\ndefinite explanation of all that is known regarding the present\r\nactions and temperatures of the Earth and of the Sun and all\r\nother heavenly bodies.'\r\n\r\nThese are, apparently, the enthusiastic comments resulting from\r\nthe re-discovery of Kant's papers. A present-day writer would\r\nnot speak so decisively of them, but we must all bow in\r\nacknowledgment of Kant's remarkable contributions to our\r\nsubject, published when he was but 31 years old.\r\n\r\nLAPLACE'S HYPOTHESIS\r\n\r\nIn 1796, 41 years following Kant's principal contributions,\r\nLaplace published an extensive untechnical volume on general\r\nastronomy. At the end of the volume he appended seven short\r\nnotes. The final note, to which he gave the curious title \"Note\r\nVII and last,\" proposed a theory of the origin and evolution of\r\nthe solar system which soon came to be known as Laplace's\r\nNebular Hypothesis. There are several circumstances which\r\nindicate pretty clearly that Laplace was not deeply serious in\r\nproposing this hypothesis:\r\n\r\n1. Its method of publication as the final short appendix to a\r\nlarge volume on general astronomy.\r\n\r\n2. He himself said in his note that the hypothesis must be\r\nreceived \"with the distrust with which everything should be\r\nregarded that is not the result of observation or calculation.\"\r\n\r\n3. So far as we know he did not submit the theory to the test\r\nof well-known mathematical principles involved, although this\r\nwas his habit in essentially every other branch of astronomy.\r\n\r\n4. Laplace, in common with Kant, laid great stress upon the\r\nfact that the satellites all revolve around their planets from\r\nwest to east, nearly in the common plane of the solar system;\r\nyet 6 or 7 years before Laplace's publication, Herschel had\r\nshown and published that the two recently discovered satellites\r\nof Uranus were revolving about Uranus in a plane making an\r\nangle of 98 degrees with the common plane of the solar system.\r\nWhile Laplace might not have known of Uranus's satellites in\r\n1796, on account of existing political conditions, there is no\r\nevidence that he considered or took note of the fact when\r\nmaking minor changes in his published papers up to the time of\r\nhis death in 1827. It is a further interesting comment on\r\ninternational scientific literature that Laplace died without\r\nlearning that Kant had worked in the same field.\r\n\r\nLaplace and his contemporary, Sir William Herschel, had been\r\nthe most fruitful contributors to astronomical knowledge since\r\nthe days of Sir Isaac Newton. Herschel's observations had led\r\nhim to speculate as to the evolution of the stars from nebulae,\r\nand as a result interest in the subject was widespread. This\r\nfact, coupled with Laplace's commanding position, caused the\r\nnebular hypothesis to be received with great favor. During an\r\nentire century it was the central idea about which astronomical\r\nthought revolved.\r\n\r\nLaplace conceived that the solar system has been evolved from a\r\ngaseous and hot nebula; that the nebulosity extended out\r\nfarther than the known planets; and that the entire nebulous\r\nmass was endowed with a slow rotation that was UNIFORM IN\r\nANGULAR RATE, as in the case of a rotating solid. This gaseous\r\nmass was in equilibrium under the expanding forces of heat and\r\nrotation and the contracting force of gravitation. Loss of heat\r\nby radiation permitted corresponding contraction in size, and\r\nincreased speed of rotation. A time came, according to Laplace,\r\nwhen the nebula was rotating so rapidly that an outer ring of\r\nnebulosity was in equilibrium under centrifugal and\r\ngravitational forces and refused to be drawn closer in toward\r\nthe center. This ring, ROTATING AS A SOLID, maintained its\r\nposition, while the inner mass contracted farther. Later\r\nanother ring was abandoned in the same manner; and so on, ring\r\nafter ring, until only the central nucleus was left. Inasmuch\r\nas the nebulosity in the rings was not uniformly distributed,\r\neach ring broke into pieces, and the pieces of each ring, in\r\nthe progress of time, condensed into a gaseous mass. The\r\nseveral large masses formed from the abandoned rings,\r\nrespectively, became the planets and satellites of the solar\r\nsystem. These gaseous masses rotated faster and faster as their\r\nheat radiated into space, they abandoned rings of gaseous\r\nmatter just as the original mass had done, and these secondary\r\nrings condensed to form the satellites; save that, in one case,\r\nthe ring of gas nearest to Saturn for some reason formed a\r\nsolid (!) ring about that planet, instead of condensing into\r\none or more satellites. Thus, in outline, according to Laplace,\r\nthe solar system was formed.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the nineteenth century found the nebular\r\nhypothesis accepted almost without question, but a tearing-down\r\nprocess began in the second half of the century, and at present\r\nnot much of the original structure remains standing. This is\r\ndue in small part to discoveries since Laplace's time, but\r\nchiefly to a more careful consideration of the fundamental\r\nprinciples involved. We have space to present only a few of the\r\nmore salient objections.\r\n\r\n1. If the materials of the solar system existed as a gas,\r\nuniformly distributed throughout what we may call the volume of\r\nthe system, the density of the gas would be exceedingly low: at\r\nthe most, several hundred million times less dense than the air\r\nwe breath. Conditions of equilibrium in so rare a medium would\r\nrequire that the abandonment of the outer parts by the\r\ncontracting and more rapidly rotating inner mass should be a\r\ncontinuous process. Each abandoned element would be abandoned\r\nindividually; it would not be vitally affected by the elements\r\nslightly farther out in the structure, nor by the elements\r\nslightly nearer to the center. Successive abandonment of nine\r\ngaseous rings of matter, EACH RING ROTATING AS IF IT WERE A\r\nSOLID STRUCTURE, is unthinkable. The real product of the\r\ncooling process in such a nebula would undoubtedly be something\r\nin the nature of a spiral nebula, in which the matter would\r\nrevolve around the nucleus the more rapidly the nearer it was\r\nto the nucleus. If the matter were originally distributed\r\nuniformly throughout the rotating structure, the spiral lines\r\nmight not be visible. If it were distributed irregularly, the\r\nspiral form here and there could scarcely fail to be in\r\nevidence to a distant observer.\r\n\r\n2. Laplace held that the condensation of each ring would result\r\nin one planet, rotating on its axis from west to east; this\r\napparently by virtue of the fact that in a ring rotating AS A\r\nSOLID the outer edge travels more rapidly than the inner edge\r\ndoes, and therefore, the west to east direction of rotation\r\nmust prevail in the planetary product. If now, as we firmly\r\nbelieve, each constituent of such an attenuated ring must\r\nrotate substantially independently of other constituents, those\r\nnearer the inner edge of the ring will possess the higher\r\nspeeds of rotation, and the preponderance of kinetic energy in\r\nthe inner parts of the ring should give the resulting planetary\r\ncondensation a retrograde direction of rotation.\r\n\r\n3. According to Laplace the satellites should all revolve\r\naround their primaries from west to east. Eight of the\r\nsatellites do not follow this rule.\r\n\r\n4. If the materials composing the inner ring of Saturn were\r\nabandoned by the parent planet, as this planet contracted in\r\nsize and rotated ever more and more rapidly, then the ring\r\nshould revolve about the planet in a period considerably longer\r\nthan the planet period. The reverse is the fact. The rotation\r\nperiod of the equatorial region of the planet itself is 10 h.\r\n14 m., whereas the inner edge of the ring system revolves about\r\nthe planet once in about five hours.\r\n\r\n5. The inner satellite of Mars revolves once in 7 h. 39 m.,\r\nwhereas Mars requires 24 h. 37 m. for one rotation. According\r\nto the Nebular Hypothesis, the period of the satellite should\r\nbe the longer.\r\n\r\n6. Laplace's hypothesis would seem to require that the orbits\r\nof the planets be circular or very nearly so. The orbits of all\r\nexcept Venus and Neptune are quite eccentric, and Mercury's\r\norbit, which should have the nearest approach to circularity,\r\nis by far the most eccentric.\r\n\r\n7. If the planetary rings were abandoned by centrifugal action,\r\nwe should expect the Sun to be rotating in the principal plane\r\nof the planet system. The major planets, from Venus out to\r\nNeptune, are revolving in nearly a common plane. The Sun,\r\ncontaining 99 6/7 per cent. of all the material in the system,\r\nhas its equator inclined 7 degrees to the planet plane. This\r\ndiscrepancy is a very serious and I think fatal objection to\r\nLaplace's hypothesis, as Chamberlin has emphasized.\r\n\r\n8. Laplace assumed a nebula whose form was a function of its\r\nrotational speed, its gravitation, its internal heat, and,\r\nalthough he does not so state, of its internal friction. He did\r\nnot distribute the matter within the nebula to conform in any\r\nway to the distribution as we observe it to-day, but he let the\r\nentire structure contract, following the loss of heat, until\r\nthe maintenance of equilibrium required the successive\r\nabandoning of seven or eight rings. He mentions a central\r\ncondensation, but gives no further particulars. Thirty years\r\nago Fouche established clearly that the condensing of Laplace's\r\nassumed nebula into the present solar system would involve the\r\nviolent breaking of the law known as the conservation of moment\r\nof momentum. Fouche proved that a distribution of matter beyond\r\nany conception of the subject by Laplace must be assumed. Fully\r\n96 per cent. must be condensed in the central nucleus AT THE\r\nOUTSET, and not more than 4 per cent. of the total mass must\r\nlie outside of the nucleus and be widely distributed throughout\r\nthe volume of the solar system. Chamberlin puts the case very\r\nstrongly in another way. If the planet Mercury was abandoned as\r\na ring of nebulosity, the equatorial velocity of the remaining\r\ncentral mass must at that time have been in the neighborhood of\r\n45 km. per second, as this is the orbital speed of Mercury. If\r\nthe central mass condensed to the present size of the Sun, the\r\nSun's equatorial velocity of rotation should now be fully 400\r\nkm. per second, in accordance with the requirement of the rigid\r\nlaw of constancy of moment of momentum. The Sun's actual\r\nequatorial velocity is only 2 km. per second!\r\n\r\nIn several other respects the hypothesis of Laplace, as he\r\nproposed it, fails to account for the facts as they are\r\nobserved to exist.\r\n\r\nPoincare devoted his unique talents to the evolution problem\r\nshortly before his death. He recognized that the Laplace\r\nhypothesis is not tenable except upon such an assumed\r\ndistribution of matter as was defined by Fouche. Accepting this\r\nmodification, and extending the hypothesis to involve the\r\napplication of tidal interactions at many points throughout the\r\nsolar system, Poincare expresses the opinion that the Laplacian\r\nhypothesis, of all those proposed, is still the one which best\r\naccounts for the facts.[3] However, he does not utilize the\r\nhypothesis of rings rotating as solids, for he finds it\r\nnecessary to conclude that the planetary masses in the\r\nbeginning must have had retrograde rotations. In the large\r\nplanetary masses of Jupiter and Saturn, for example, the\r\nmaterials which form the outer retrograde satellites were\r\nabandoned while the rotations were still retrograde, and when\r\nthe diameters of the planetary masses were several scores of\r\ntimes their present diameters. In these extended masses the Sun\r\nwould create tidal waves, and here, as always, such waves would\r\nexert a retarding effect upon the rotations. A time would come,\r\nPoincare thought, when these planets would rotate once in a\r\nrevolution; that is, present the same face to the Sun; and this\r\nis in fact a west to east rotation. Further contraction of the\r\nplanetary masses would give rise to increasing rotational\r\nspeeds in the west to east direction. The materials which form\r\nthe inner satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were abandoned\r\nsuccessively after the west to east direction of rotation had\r\nbecome established. According to modifications of the same\r\ntheory, tidal retardation has slowed down Saturn's speed since\r\nthe abandonment of the materials which later condensed to form\r\nthe inner ring of that planet; or, possibly, the ring materials\r\nencountered resistance after the planet abandoned them, with\r\nthe consequence that the ring drew in toward the planet and\r\nincreased its speed; and similarly in the case of Mars and its\r\ninner satellite.\r\n\r\n[3] Poincare has made the following interesting comments on\r\nLaplace's hypothesis: \"The oldest hypothesis is that of\r\nLaplace; but its old age is vigorous and for its age it has not\r\ntoo many wrinkles. In spite of the objections which have been\r\nurged against it, in spite of the discoveries which astronomers\r\nhave made and which would indeed astonish Laplace himself, it\r\nis always standing the strain, and it is the hypothesis which\r\nbest explains the facts; it is the hypothesis which responds\r\nbest to the question which Laplace endeavored to answer, Why\r\ndoes order rule throughout the solar system, provided this\r\norder is not due to chance? From time to time a breach opened\r\nin the old edifice (the Laplace hypothesis); but the breach was\r\npromptly repaired and the edifice has not fallen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me this modification of the Laplacian hypothesis is\r\nunsatisfactory, for several reasons. To mention only one: if\r\nJupiter was a large gaseous mass extending out as far as the\r\n8th and 9th satellites, the gaseous body was very highly\r\nattenuated; friction in the outer strata would be essentially a\r\nnegligible quantity, and tidal retardation would not be very\r\neffective; and it would be under just these conditions that\r\nloss of heat from the planet should be most rapid and the rate\r\nof increase of retrograde rotation resulting therefrom be\r\ncomparatively high. It would seem that the rotation of the\r\nplanet in the retrograde direction must have accelerated under\r\nthe contractional cause, rather than have decreased and\r\nreversed in direction under an excessively feeble tidal cause.\r\n\r\nThe recognized weaknesses of Laplace's hypothesis have caused\r\nmany other hypotheses to be proposed in the past half century.\r\nThe hypotheses of Faye, Lockyer, du Ligondes, See, Arrhenius,\r\nand Chamberlin and Moulton include many of the features of\r\nKant's or Laplace's hypotheses, but all of them advance and\r\ndevelop other ideas. It is unfortunate that space limits do not\r\npermit us to discuss the new features of each hypothesis.\r\n\r\n(To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS AND PEACE\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR ROBERT M. YERKES\r\n\r\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nLASTING peace among the nations of the earth we must regard as\r\nof supreme moment, the discovery of the conditions thereof, as\r\nmost worthy of human effort. Physical struggle is no longer\r\naccepted as either a necessary or a desirable means of settling\r\ndifferences between individuals. Why, then, should it be\r\ntolerated to-day in connection with national disagreements? To\r\nadmit the impossibility or the impracticability of universal\r\npeace is to stigmatize our vaunted civilization as a failure.\r\nSurely we will not, can not, humble ourselves by such an\r\nadmission until we have exhausted our energies in searching for\r\nthe conditions of national amity.\r\n\r\nWith my whole life I believe in the possibility and value of\r\nworldwide friendliness and cooperation. I am writing to discuss\r\nnot the attainability or the merits of peace, but ways of\r\nachieving it; not to criticize present activities on its\r\nbehalf, but to indicate the promise of a neglected approach and\r\nto present a program which should, I believe, find its place in\r\nthe great \"peace movement.\"\r\n\r\nMust peace be achieved and maintained by brute strength,\r\nregardless of sense and sentiment, or may it be gained through\r\nintelligence, humanely used? Must the pathway thereto be paved\r\nwith human skulls, builded with infinite suffering and\r\nsacrifice, or may it he charted by scientific inquiry and\r\nbuilded by the joyous labor of mutual service and helpfulness?\r\nIs it possible, in the light of the history of the races of\r\nman, to doubt that we must place our dependence on intelligence\r\nsympathetically employed, not on physical prowess? To me it\r\nseems that peace must be achieved peacefully, not by the clash\r\nof arms and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nBut even if we grant that science is our main hope, there\r\nremains a choice of methods. On the one hand, there is the way\r\nof material progress, physical discovery and feverish haste to\r\napply every new fact to armament; on the other, that of\r\nbiological research, social enlightenment, and ever-increasing\r\nhuman understanding and sympathy.\r\n\r\nFirm believers in each of these possible approaches, through\r\nscience, to international peace, are at hand. The one group\r\nargues that nations, like individuals, must be controlled in\r\nall supreme crises by fear; the other contends that\r\ncivilization has developed in enlightened human sympathy a\r\nhigher, a more worthy, and a safer control of behavior.\r\n\r\nAs a biologist and a believer in the brotherhood of man, I wish\r\nto present the merits of sympathy, as contrasted with fear, and\r\nto plead for larger attention to the biological approach to the\r\ncontrol of international relations. For I am convinced that the\r\ngreatest lesson of the present stupendous world-conflict is the\r\nneed of thorough knowledge of the laws of individual and social\r\nhuman behavior. Surely this war clearly indicates that the\r\nstudy of instinct, and the use of our knowledge for the control\r\nof human relations, is incalculably more important for the\r\nwelfare of mankind than is the discovery of new and ever more\r\npowerful explosives or the building of increasingly terrible\r\nengines of destruction.\r\n\r\nDuring the last half-century the physical sciences,\r\ntechnologies, arts and industries, have made marvelous\r\nadvances. At enormous cost of labor and material resources\r\nthere have been discovered and perfected means of destroying\r\nlife and property at once so effective and so terrible to\r\ncontemplate that preparedness for war seemed a safe guarantee\r\nof peace. But who is there now to insist, against the evidence\r\nof blood-drenched Europe, that material progress, physical\r\ndiscovery, and armament based thereupon, assure international\r\nfriendship?\r\n\r\nOnly if one of the nations should discover, and guard as its\r\nsecret, some diabolically horrible means of destroying human\r\nlife and property by wholesale and over materially unbridged\r\ndistances, can armaments even temporarily put an end to war. In\r\nsuch event--and it is by no means an improbability--the whole\r\nworld might suddenly be made to bow in terror before the will\r\nof the all-powerful nation. Before this approaching crisis, can\r\nwe do less than earnestly pray that the translation of physical\r\nprogress into armament may be halted until the brotherhood of\r\nman has been further advanced? Dare we stop to contemplate what\r\nwould happen to-morrow if Germany, with half the civilized\r\nworld arrayed against her, should come into possession of some\r\nimponderable, and to the untutored mind mysterious, means of\r\ndirecting her torpedoes, exploding magazines, mines, shells\r\nfrom distant bases? Undoubtedly we are close upon the\r\nemployment of certain vibrations for this deadly purpose. Shall\r\nwe veer in time and take a safer course, or are we doomed to\r\nthe inevitable?\r\n\r\nFor the certain result of pushing forward relentlessly on the\r\npath of preparation for war--in the name of peace--is the\r\ndominance of a single nation and the destruction or subjugation\r\nof all others. This is as inevitable as is death. If we would\r\npreserve and foster racial and national diversity of traits,\r\npromote social individuality as we so eagerly foster the\r\ndiversity of selves, we must speedily focus attention upon\r\nhuman nature and seek that knowledge of it which shall enable\r\nus to control it wisely rather than to destroy it ruthlessly.\r\n\r\nEven were I able to do so, I should in no degree belittle the\r\nachievements of the physical sciences and their technologies,\r\nfor I believe whole-heartedly in their value, and long for the\r\nsteady increase of our power to control our environment. But\r\nwhen these achievements are offered as means of creating or\r\nmaintaining certain desired conditions of individual and social\r\nlife, I must insist that other knowledge is essential--nay,\r\nmore essential--than that of the physicist or chemist.\r\nKnowledge, namely, of life itself.\r\n\r\nMost briefly, the situation may thus be described. In peace and\r\nin war there are two large, complex and intricate groups of\r\nfacts to be dealt with by those who seek the welfare of man.\r\nThe one group comprises the phenomena of physical nature as the\r\ncondition of life--environment; the other is constituted by the\r\nphenomena of life and the relations of lives. Those who\r\nsincerely believe in preparedness for war as a preventive\r\nmeasure, misconceive and attempt to misuse the emotion of fear\r\nand its modes of expression. It is as though we should strive\r\ntirelessly to develop machinery and methods for educating our\r\nchildren, the while ignorant of the laws of child development\r\nand branding as of no practical importance the fundamentals of\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\nTo nations no more than to individuals is it given to live by\r\nfear alone. By it a nation may become dominant, and diversity\r\nof body, mind, and ideals be eradicated. To base our\r\ncivilization upon fear entails uniformity, monotony of life;\r\nthe sacrifice of peoples for the unduly exalted traits and\r\nnational ideals of a single homogeneous social group--a single\r\nall-powerful nation. Knowledge of life, and the sympathy for\r\none's fellow men which springs from it, must control the world\r\nif nations are to live in peaceful and mutually helpful\r\nrelations. If life, whether of the individual or of the social\r\ngroup, is to be controlled, it must be through intimate\r\nknowledge of life, not through knowledge of something else. The\r\nworld must be ruled by sympathy, based upon understanding,\r\ninsight, appreciation. This is my prophecy, this my faith and\r\nmy present thesis.\r\n\r\nMaterial as contrasted with purely intellectual or spiritual\r\nprogress is the pride of our time. We worship technology as\r\nreared upon physics and chemistry. But what is our gain, in\r\nthis progress, so long as we continue to use one another as\r\ntargets? Would it not be wiser, more far-sighted, more humane,\r\nmore favorable to the development of universal peace and\r\nbrotherhood, to give a large share of our time and substance to\r\nthe search for the secrets of life? As compared with the\r\nphysical sciences, the biological departments of inquiry are,\r\nin general, backward and ill-supported. Why? Because their\r\ntremendous importance is not generally recognized, and, still\r\nmore, because the control of inanimate nature as promised by\r\nphysical discovery and its applications appeals irresistibly\r\nboth to our imagination and to our greed. We long for\r\npeace--because we are afraid of war--we long for the perfecting\r\nof individual and social life, but much more intensely and\r\neffectively we long for wealth, power and pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhat I have already said and now repeat in other words is that\r\nif we really desired above anything attainable on earth the\r\nlasting peace of nations, we should diligently foster and\r\ntirelessly pursue the sciences of life and seek to perfect and\r\nexalt the varied arts and technologies which should be based\r\nupon them. Experimental zoology and genetics; physiology and\r\nhygiene; genetic psychology and education; anthropology and\r\nethnology; sociology and economics, would be held in as high\r\nesteem and as ardently furthered as are the various physical\r\nsciences and their technologies.\r\n\r\nDoes it not seem reasonable to claim that human behavior may be\r\nintelligently controlled or directed only in the light of\r\nintimate and exhaustive knowledge of the organism, its\r\nprocesses, and its relations to its environment? If this be\r\ntrue, how pitiably, how shamefully, inadequate is our knowledge\r\neven of ourselves! How few are those who have a sound, although\r\nmeager, knowledge of the laws of heredity, of the primary facts\r\nof human physiology, of the principles of hygiene, of the chief\r\nfacts and laws of mental life, including the fundamental\r\nemotions and their corresponding instinctive modes of action,\r\nthe modifiability or educability of the individual and the\r\nimportant relations of varied sorts of experience and conduct,\r\nthe laws of habit, the nature and role of the sentiments, the\r\nunnumbered varieties of memory and ideation, the chief facts of\r\nsocial life and their relations to individual experience and\r\nbehavior. Not one person in a thousand has a knowledge of life\r\nand its conditions equal in adequacy for practical demands to\r\nhis knowledge of those aspects of physical nature with which he\r\nis concerned in earning a livelihood. Even those of us who have\r\ndedicated our lives to the study of life are humble before our\r\nignorance. But with a faith which can not be shaken, because we\r\nhave seen visions and dreamed dreams, we insist that the\r\nknowledge which we seek and daily find is absolutely essential\r\nfor the perfecting of educational methods; for the development\r\nof effective systems of bodily and mental hygiene; for the\r\ndiscovery, fostering and maintenance of increasingly profitable\r\nsocial relations and organizations. In a word, we believe that\r\nbiology, of all sciences, can and must lead us in the path of\r\nsocial as contrasted with merely material progress; can and\r\nultimately will so alter the relations of nations that war\r\nshall be as impossible as is peace to-day.\r\n\r\nFortunately the biologist may depend, in his efforts to further\r\nthe study of all aspects of life, not upon faith and hope\r\nalone, but also upon works, for already physiology and\r\npsychology have transformed our educational practices; and the\r\nmedical sciences given us a great and steadily increasing\r\nmeasure of control over disease.\r\n\r\nAt least two men, as different in intellectual equipment,\r\nhabits of mind, and methods of inquiry as well could be, the\r\none an American, the other an Englishman, have heralded the\r\nbroadly comparative and genetic study of mind and behavior--let\r\nus call it Genetic Psychology--as the promise of a new era for\r\ncivilization, because the essential condition of the\r\nintelligent and effective regulation of life.\r\n\r\nThe one of these prophets among biologists, President G.\r\nStanley Hall, has lived to see his faith in the practical\r\nimportance of the intensive study of childhood and adolescence\r\njustified by radical reforms in school and home. Hall should be\r\nrevered by all lovers of youth as the apostle to adolescents.\r\nThe other, Professor William McDougall, has done much to\r\nconvince the thinking world that all of the social sciences and\r\ntechnologies must be grounded upon an adequate genetic\r\npsychology--a genetic psychology which shall take as full and\r\nintelligent account of behavior as of experience; of the life\r\nof the ant, monkey, ape as of that of man; of the savage as of\r\ncivilized man; of the infant, child, adolescent as of the\r\nadult; of the moron, imbecile, idiot, insane, as of the normal\r\nindividual; of social groups as of isolated selves. It is to\r\nMcDougall we owe a most effective sketch--in his introduction\r\nto Social Psychology of the primary human emotions in their\r\nrelations to instinctive modes of behavior.\r\n\r\nHall, McDougall and such sociologists--lamentably few, I\r\nfear--as Graham Wallas would agree that for the attainment of\r\npeace we must depend upon some primary human instinct. I\r\nventure the prediction that no one of them would select fear as\r\nthe safe basis. Instead, they surely would unite upon sympathy.\r\n\r\nAmong animals preparedness for struggles is a conspicuous cause\r\nof strife. The monkey who stalks about among his fellows with\r\nmuscles tense, tail erect, teeth bared, bespeaking expectancy\r\nof and longing for a fight, usually provokes it. We may not\r\nsafely argue that lower animals prove the value of preparedness\r\nfor war as a preventive measure! Among them, as among human\r\ngroups, the only justification of militarism is protection and\r\naggression. Preparedness for strife is provocative rather than\r\npreventive thereof.\r\n\r\nAs individual differences, and resulting struggles, are due to\r\nignorance, misunderstanding, lack of the basis for intelligent\r\nappreciation of ideals, motives and sympathy, so among nations\r\nknowledge of bodily and mental traits, of aims, aspirations,\r\nand national ideals fosters the feeling of kinship and favors\r\nthe instinctive attitude of sympathetic cooperation.\r\n\r\nEvery student of living things knows that to understand the\r\nstructure, habits, instincts, of any creature is to feel for\r\nand with it. Even the lowliest type of organism acquires\r\ndignity and worth when one becomes familiar with its life.\r\nChildren in their ignorance and lack of understanding are\r\nincredibly cruel. So, likewise, are nations. The treatment of\r\ninferior by superior races throughout the ages has been\r\nchildishly cruel, unjust, stupid, inimical to the best\r\ninterests not only of the victims, but also of mankind. This\r\nhas been so, not so much by reason of bad intentions, although\r\nselfishness has been at the root of immeasurable injustice, but\r\nprimarily because of the utter lack of understanding and\r\nsympathy. To see a savage is to despise or fear him, to know\r\nhim intimately is to love him. The same law holds of social\r\ngroups, be they families, tribes, nations or races. They can\r\ncooperate on terms of friendly helpfulness just in the measure\r\nin which they know one another's physical, mental and social\r\ntraits and appreciate their values, for in precisely this\r\nmeasure are they capable of understanding and sympathizing with\r\none another's ideals.\r\n\r\nSelfishness, the essential condition of individualism and\r\nnationalism, must be supplanted by the sympathy of an all\r\ninclusive social consciousness and conscience if lasting peace\r\nis to be attained.\r\n\r\nTo further the end of this transformation of man we should\r\nbecome familiar with the inborn springs to action, those\r\nfundamental tendencies which we call instincts, for we live\r\nmore largely than is generally supposed by instinct and less by\r\nreason. All of the organic cravings, hungers, needs, should be\r\nthoroughly understood so that they may be effectively used.\r\nAnd, finally, the laws of intellect must be at our command if\r\nwe are to meet the endlessly varying and puzzling situations of\r\nlife profitably and with the measure of adequacy our reason\r\nwould seem to justify.\r\n\r\nClearly, then, the least, and the most, we can do in the\r\ninterest of peace is to provide for the study of life, but\r\nespecially for the shamefully neglected or imperfectly\r\ndescribed phenomena of behavior and mind, in the measure which\r\nour national wealth, our intelligence and our technical skill\r\nmake possible. For one thing, it is open to us to establish\r\ninstitutes for the thorough study of every aspect of behavior\r\nand mind in relation to structure and environment, comparable\r\nwith such institutions for social progress as the Rockefeller\r\nInstitute for Medical Research. The primary function of such\r\ncenters for the solution of vital problems should be the\r\ncomparative study, from the genetic, developmental, historical,\r\npoint of view of every aspect of the functional life of living\r\nthings, to the end that human life may be better understood and\r\nmore successfully controlled. Facts of heredity, of behavior,\r\nof mind, of social relations, should alike be gathered and\r\nrelated, and thus by the observation of the most varied types,\r\ndevelopmental stages, and conditions of living creatures there\r\nshould be developed a science of behavior and consciousness\r\nwhich should ultimately constitute a safe basis for the social\r\nsciences, for all forms of social endeavor, and for universal\r\nand permanent peace.\r\n\r\nI submit that such centers of research as the psycho-biological\r\ninstitute I have so imperfectly described are sorely needed.\r\nFor it is obvious that the future of our species depends in\r\nlarge measure upon how we develop the biological sciences and\r\nwhat use we make of our knowledge. I further submit, and\r\ntherewith I rest my case, that familiarity with living things\r\nbreeds sympathy not contempt, and that sympathy in turn\r\nconditions justice.\r\n\r\nMay it be granted us to work intelligently, effectively,\r\ntirelessly for world-wide peace and service. not by the\r\nsuppression of racial and national diversities, the leveling of\r\nthe mass to a deadly sameness, but through steadily increasing\r\nappreciation of racial and national traits. May the world, even\r\nsooner than we dare to hope, be ruled by sympathy instead of by\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\nTHE MISSOURI AND THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDENS\r\n\r\nTHE Missouri Botanical Garden has recently celebrated the\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of its foundation and the New York\r\nBotanical Garden its twentieth anniversary. Within these short\r\nperiods these gardens have taken rank among the leading\r\nscientific institutions of the world. Botanical gardens were\r\namong the first institutions to be established for scientific\r\nresearch; indeed Parkinson, the \"botanist royal\" of England, on\r\nthe title page of his book of 1629, which we here reproduce,\r\ndepicts the Garden of Eden as the first botanical garden and\r\none which apparently engaged in scientific expeditions, for it\r\nincludes plants which must have been collected in America.\r\nHowever this may be, publicly supported gardens for the\r\ncultivation of plants of economic and esthetic value existed in\r\nEgypt, Assyria, China and Mexico and beginning in the medieval\r\nperiod had a large development in Europe there being at the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century botanical gardens devoted\r\nto research in Bologna, Montpellier, Leyden, Paris, Upsala and\r\nelsewhere. An interesting survey of the history of botanical\r\ngardens is given in a paper by Dr. A W. Hill assistant director\r\nof the Kew Gardens, prepared for the celebration of the\r\nMissouri Garden, from which we have taken the illustration from\r\nParkinson and the pictures of Padua and Kew.\r\n\r\nThe papers presented at the celebration have been published in\r\na handsome volume. It includes addresses by a number of\r\ndistinguished botanists, though owing to the war several of the\r\nforeign botanists were unable to be present. Dr. George T.\r\nMoore, director of the garden, made in his address of welcome a\r\nbrief statement in regard to its origin in the private garden\r\nand by the later endowment of Mr. Henry Shaw. Mr. Shaw came to\r\nthis country from England in 1818, and with a small stock of\r\nhardware began business in one room which also served as\r\nbedroom and kitchen. Within twenty years he had acquired a\r\nfortune and retired from active business to devote the\r\nremaining forty-nine years of his life to travel and to the\r\nmanagement of a garden surrounding his country-home on the\r\noutskirts of St. Louis. In 1859 he erected a small museum and\r\nlibrary, and in 1866 Mr. James Gurney was brought to this\r\ncountry as head gardener. Mr. Shaw died in 1889, leaving his\r\nestate largely for the establishment of the Missouri Botanical\r\nGarden, but providing also for the Henry Shaw School of Botany\r\nof Washington University and a park for the city. With this\r\nliberal endowment constantly increasing as the real estate\r\nbecomes more productive, Dr. William Trelease, the first\r\ndirector, and Dr. George T. Moore, the present director, have\r\nconducted an institution not only of value to the city of St.\r\nLouis but largely contributing to the advance of botanical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe New York Botanical Garden, largely through the efforts of\r\nDr. N. L. Britton, the present director was authorized by the\r\nNew York legislature in 1891. The act of incorporation provided\r\nthat when the corporation created should have secured by\r\nsubscription a sum not less than $250,000 the city was\r\nauthorized to set aside for the garden as much as 250 acres\r\nfrom one of the public parks and to expend one half million\r\ndollars for the construction and equipment of the necessary\r\nbuildings. The conditions were met in 1895, and the institution\r\nhas since grown in its land, and its buildings, in its\r\ncollections and in its herbaria, so that, in association with\r\nthe department of botany of Columbia University, it now rivals\r\nin its material equipment and in the research work accomplished\r\nany botanical institution in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PAN-AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS\r\n\r\nTHERE will be held at Washington from Monday, December 27, to\r\nSaturday, January 9, the second Pan-American Scientific\r\nCongress, authorized by the first congress held in Santiago,\r\nChili, six years previously. This was one of the series of\r\ncongresses previously conducted by the republics of Latin\r\nAmerica. The Washington congress, which is under the auspices\r\nof the government of the United States, with Mr. William\r\nPhillips, third assistant secretary of state, as chairman of\r\nthe executive committee, will meet in nine sections, which,\r\nwith the chairmen, are as follows:\r\n\r\nI. Anthropology, Wm. H. Holmes.\r\n\r\nII. Astronomy, Meteorology, and Seismology, Robert S. Woodward.\r\n\r\nIII. Conservation of Natural Resources, Agriculture, Irrigation\r\nand Forestry, George M. Rommel.\r\n\r\nIV. Education, P. P. Claxton.\r\n\r\nV. Engineering, W. H. Bixby.\r\n\r\nVI. International Law, Public Law, and Jurisprudence, James\r\nBrown Scott.\r\n\r\nVII. Mining and Metallurgy, Economic Geology, and Applied\r\nChemistry, Hennen Jennings.\r\n\r\nVIII. Public Health and Medical Science, Wm. C. Gorgas.\r\n\r\nIX. Transportation, Commerce, Finance, and Taxation, L. S.\r\nRowe.\r\n\r\nEach section is divided further into subsections, of which\r\nthere are forty-five, each with a special committee and\r\nprogram. Several of the leading national associations of the\r\nUnited States, concerned with the investigation of subjects of\r\npertinent interest to some of the sections of the congress,\r\nhave received and accepted invitations from the executive\r\ncommittee of congress to meet in Washington at the same time\r\nand hold one or more joint sessions with a section or\r\nsubsection of corresponding interest. Thus the nineteenth\r\nInternational Congress of Americanists will meet in Washington\r\nduring the same week with the Pan-American Scientific Congress,\r\nand joint conferences will be held for the discussion of\r\nsubjects of common interest to members of the two organizations\r\n\r\nAs an example of the wide scope of the congress we may quote\r\nthe ten subsections into which the section of education is\r\ndivided. Each of these subsections is under a committee of men\r\ndistinguished in educational work and men of eminence have been\r\ninvited to take part in the proceedings. The subjects proposed\r\nfor discussion by each of these sections are:\r\n\r\nElementary Education: To what extent should elementary\r\neducation be supported by local taxation, and to what extent by\r\nstate taxation? What should be the determining factors in the\r\ndistribution of support? Secondary Education: What should be\r\nthe primary and what the secondary purpose of high school\r\neducation? To what extent should courses of study in the high\r\nschool be determined by the requirements for admission to\r\ncollege, and to what extent by the demands of industrial and\r\ncivic life? University Education: Should universities and\r\ncolleges supported by public funds be controlled by independent\r\nand autonomous powers, or should they be controlled directly by\r\ncentral state authority? Education of Women: To what extent is\r\ncoeducation desirable in elementary schools, high schools,\r\ncolleges and universities? Exchange of Professors and Students\r\nbetween Countries: To what extent is an exchange of students\r\nand professors between American republics desirable? What is\r\nthe most effective basis for a system of exchange?

(HON.)\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF HAVANA.\r\n\r\nTHE construction of the Panama Canal was made possible because\r\nit was shown that yellow fever, like malaria, could be spread\r\nonly by the bites of infected mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThe same discovery, which has been repeatedly referred to as\r\nthe greatest medical achievement of the twentieth century, was\r\nthe means of stamping out the dreaded scourge in Cuba, as well\r\nas in New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Vera Cruz, Colon, Panama and\r\nother Cities in America.\r\n\r\nThis article is intended to narrate the motives that led up to\r\nthe investigation and also the manner in which the work was\r\nplanned, executed and terminated. No names are withheld and the\r\ndate of every important event is given, so that an interested\r\nreader may be enabled to follow closely upon the order of\r\nthings as they occurred and thus form a correct idea of the\r\nimportance of the undertaking, the risk entailed in its\r\naccomplishment and how evenly divided was the work among those\r\nwho, in the faithful performance of their military duties,\r\ncontributed so much for the benefit of mankind; the magnitude\r\nof their achievement is of such proportions, that it loses\r\nnothing of its greatness when we tear away the halo of apparent\r\nheroism that well-meaning but ignorant historians have thrown\r\nabout some of the investigators.\r\n\r\nThe whole series of events, tragic, pathetic, comical and\r\notherwise, took place upon a stage made particularly fit by\r\nnature and the surrounding circumstances.\r\n\r\nColumbia Barracks, a military reservation, garrisoned by some\r\nfourteen hundred troops, distant about eight miles from the\r\ncity of Havana, the latter, suffering at the time from an\r\nepidemic of yellow fever, which the application of all sanitary\r\nmeasures had failed to check or ameliorate and finally, our\r\nexperimental camp (Camp Lazear), a few army tents, securely\r\nhidden from the road leading to Marianao, and safeguarded\r\nagainst intercourse with the outside world; the whole setting\r\nportentously silent and gloriously bright in the glow of\r\ntropical sunlight and the green of luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nTwo members of a detachment of four medical officers of the\r\nUnited States Army, on the morning of August 31, 1900, were\r\nbusily examining under microscopes several glass slides\r\ncontaining blood from a fellow officer who, since the day\r\nbefore, had shown symptoms of yellow fever; these men were Drs.\r\nJesse W. Lazear and myself; our sick colleague was Dr. James\r\nCarroll, who presumably had been infected by one of our\r\n\"experiment mosquitoes.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to describe the feelings which assailed us\r\nat that moment; a sense of exultation at our apparent success\r\nno doubt animated us; regret, because the results had evidently\r\nbrought a dangerous illness upon our coworker and with it all\r\nassociated a thrill of uncertainty for the reason of the yet\r\ninsufficient testimony tending to prove the far-reaching truth\r\nwhich we then hardly dared to realize.\r\n\r\nAs the idea that Carroll's fever must have been caused by the\r\nmosquito that was applied to him four days before became fixed\r\nupon our minds, we decided to test it upon the first non-immune\r\nperson who should offer himself to be bitten; this was of\r\ncommon occurrence and taken much as a joke among the soldiers\r\nabout the military hospital. Barely fifteen minutes may have\r\nelapsed since we had come to this decision when, as Lazear\r\nstood at the door of the laboratory trying to \"coax\" a mosquito\r\nto pass from one test-tube into another, a soldier came walking\r\nby towards the hospital buildings; he saluted, as it is\r\ncustomary in the army upon meeting an officer, but, as Lazear\r\nhad both hands engaged, he answered with a rather pleasant\r\n\"Good morning.\" The man stopped upon coming abreast, curious no\r\ndoubt to see the performance with the tubes, and after gazing\r\nfor a minute or two at the insects he said: \"You still fooling\r\nwith mosquitoes, Doctor?\" \"Yes,\" returned Lazear, \"will you\r\ntake a bite?\" \"Sure I ain't scared of 'em,\" responded the man.\r\nWhen I heard this, I left the microscope and stepped to the\r\ndoor, where the short conversation had taken place; Lazear\r\nlooked at me as though in consultation; I nodded assent, then\r\nturned to the soldier and asked him to come inside and bare his\r\nforearm. Upon a slip of paper I wrote his name while several\r\nmosquitoes took their fill; William E. Dean, American by birth,\r\nbelonging to Troop B, Seventh Cavalry; he said that he had\r\nnever been in the tropics before and had not left the military\r\nreservation for nearly two months. The conditions for a test\r\ncase were quite ideal.\r\n\r\nI must say we were in great trepidation at the time; and well\r\nmight we have been, for Dean's was the first indubitable case\r\nof yellow fever about to be produced experimentally by the bite\r\nof purposely infected mosquitoes. Five days afterwards, when he\r\ncame down with yellow fever and the diagnosis of his case was\r\ncorroborated by Dr. Roger P. Ames, U. S. Army, then on duty at\r\nthe hospital, we sent a cablegram to Major Walter Reed,\r\nchairman of the board, who a month before had been called to\r\nWashington upon another duty, apprising him of the fact that\r\nthe theory of the transmission of yellow fever by mosquitoes,\r\nwhich at first was doubted so much and the transcendental\r\nimportance of which we could then barely appreciate, had indeed\r\nbeen confirmed.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF THINGS BEFORE THE DISCOVERY OF MOSQUITO TRANSMISSION\r\n\r\nOther infectious diseases, tuberculosis, for instance, may\r\ncause a greater death-rate and bring about more misery and\r\ndistress, even to-day, than yellow fever has produced at any\r\none time; but no disease, except possibly cholera or the\r\nplague, is so tragic in its development, so appalling in its\r\naction, so devastating in its results, nor does any other make\r\ngreater havoc than yellow fever when it invades non-immune or\r\nsusceptible communities.\r\n\r\nFor two centuries, at least, the disease has been known to\r\nexist endemically, that is, more or less continuously, in most\r\nof the Mexican Gulf ports, extending its ravages along the West\r\nIndia Islands and the cities of the Central and the South\r\nAmerican coast.\r\n\r\nIn the United States it has made its appearance in epidemic\r\nform as far north as Portsmouth, N. H. At Philadelphia in 1793,\r\nmore than ten per cent. of the entire population died of yellow\r\nfever. Other cities, like Charleston, S. C., suffered more than\r\ntwenty epidemics in as many summers, during the eighteenth\r\ncentury. In the city of New Orleans, the epidemic which\r\ndeveloped in the summer of 1853 caused more than 7,000 deaths.\r\nLater, in 1878, yellow fever invaded 132 towns in the United\r\nStates, producing a loss of 15,932 lives out of a total number\r\nof cases which reached to more than 74,000: New Orleans alone\r\nsuffered a mortality of 4,600 at that time. Recently (1905),\r\nthis city withstood what is to be hoped shall prove its last\r\ninvasion, which, thanks to the modern methods employed in its\r\nsuppression, based upon the new mosquito doctrine, only\r\ndestroyed about 3,000 lives.\r\n\r\nIt is by contemplating this awful record, and much more there\r\nis which for the sake of brevity I leave unstated, that one\r\nrealizes the boon to mankind which the successful researches of\r\nthe Army Board have proved. The work of prevention, the only\r\none that may be considered effective when dealing with the\r\nepidemic diseases, was entirely misguided with regard to yellow\r\nfever until 1901: the sick were surrounded by precautions which\r\nwere believed most useful in other infectious diseases, the\r\nattendants were often looked upon as pestilential, and so\r\ntreated, in spite of the fact that evidence from the early\r\nhistory of the disease clearly pointed to the apparent\r\nharmlessness even of the patients themselves. All this\r\nnotwithstanding, cases continued to develop, in the face of\r\nshotgun quarantine even, until the last non-immune inhabitant\r\nof the locality had been either cured or buried.\r\n\r\nThe mystery which accompanied the usual course of an epidemic,\r\nthe poison creeping from house to house, along one side of a\r\nstreet, seldom, crossing the road, spreading sometimes around\r\nthe whole block of houses before appearing in another\r\nneighborhood, unless distinctly carried there by a visitor to\r\nthe infected zone who himself became stricken, all this series\r\nof peculiar circumstances was a never-ending source of\r\ndiscussion and investigation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1900, Surgeon H. R. Carter, of the then Marine\r\nHospital Service, published a very interesting paper calling\r\nattention to the interval of time which regularly occurred\r\nbetween the first case of yellow fever in a given community and\r\nthose that subsequently followed; this was never less than two\r\nweeks, a period of incubation extending beyond that usually\r\naccorded to other acute infectious diseases. The accuracy of\r\nthese observations has later been confirmed by the mosquito\r\nexperiments hereinafter outlined.\r\n\r\nFACTORS WHICH LED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF THE BOARD\r\n\r\nOne may well believe that such a scourge as yellow fever could\r\nnot have been long neglected by medical investigators, and so\r\nwe find that from the earliest days, when the germ-theory of\r\ndisease took its proper place in modern science, a search for\r\nthe causative agent of this infection was more or less actively\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nMen of the highest attainments in bacteriology engaged in\r\nnumerous attempts to isolate the yellow fever microbe:\r\nunfortunately not a few charlatans took advantage of the dread\r\nand terror which the disease inspires, to proclaim their\r\ndiscoveries and their specific CURES; one of these obtained\r\nwealth and honor in one of the South American republics for\r\npresumably having discovered the \"germ\" and prepared a\r\nso-called vaccination which was expected to eradicate the\r\ndisease from that country, but for many years after the foreign\r\npopulation continued to suffer as before and the intensity and\r\nthe spread of yellow fever remained unabated, although\r\nthousands of \"preventive inoculations\" were made every month.\r\n\r\nGeo. M. Sternberg in 1880, then an army surgeon, was directly\r\ninstrumental in exposing the swindle that was being\r\nperpetrated, putting an end, after the most painstaking\r\ninvestigation, to all the claims to discovery of the \"germ\" of\r\nyellow fever that had been made by several medical men in\r\nSpanish America. The experience which he obtained during a\r\nscientific excursion through Mexico, Cuba and South America\r\ngave him a wonderful insight as to the difficulties one has to\r\ncontend with in such work and made him realize the importance\r\nof special laboratory training for such undertaking. It is\r\ninteresting to note that, as surgeon general of the U. S. Army,\r\ntwenty years after, General Sternberg chose and appointed the\r\nmen who constituted the yellow fever board, in Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe year before the Spanish-American war, an Italian savant,\r\nwho had obtained a well-deserved reputation as bacteriologist\r\nwhile working in the Institute Pasteur of Paris, came out with\r\nthe announcement from Montevideo, Uruguay, that he had actually\r\ndiscovered the much-sought-for cause of yellow fever; his\r\ndescriptions of the methods employed, though not materially\r\ndifferent from those followed by Sternberg many years before,\r\nbore the imprint of truth and his experimental inoculations had\r\napparently been successful. Sanarelli--that is his name--for\r\nabout two years was the \"hero of the hour,\" yet his claims have\r\nbeen proved absolutely false.\r\n\r\nThe question of the identity of his \"germ\" was first taken up\r\nby the writer under instructions from General Sternberg: during\r\nthe Santiago campaign I had opportunity to autopsy a\r\nconsiderable number of yellow fever cases and, following\r\nclosely upon Sanarelli's directions, only three times out of\r\nten could his bacillus be demonstrated; at almost the same\r\ntime, Drs. Reed and Carroll, in Washington, were carrying out\r\nexperiments which showed that Sanarelli's bacillus belonged to\r\nthe hog-cholera group of bacteria and thus when found in yellow\r\nfever cadavers could play there only a secondary role as far as\r\nthe infection is concerned.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, two investigators belonging to the U. S. Marine\r\nHospital Service, Drs. Wasdin and Gleddings, were, according to\r\ntheir claims, corroborating Sanarelli's findings: there was\r\nnothing to do but that the investigation should continue, and\r\nso I was sent by General Sternberg to Havana in December, 1898,\r\nwith instructions and power to do all that might be necessary\r\nto clear up the matter. Wasdin and Geddings had preceded me;\r\nthe work carried us through the summer of 1899; we frequently\r\ninvestigated the same cases; I often autopsied bodies from\r\nwhich we took the same specimens and made the same cultures, in\r\ngenerally the same kind of media, and finally we rendered our\r\nreports to our respective departments, Wasdin and Geddings\r\naffirming that Sanarelli's bacillus was present in almost all\r\nthe cases, while I denied that it had such specific character\r\nand showed its occurrence in cases not yellow fever. A virulent\r\nepidemic which raged in the city of Santiago and vicinity\r\nduring 1899 afforded me abundant material for research.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the city of Havana was being rendered sanitary\r\nin a way which experience had taught would have overcome any\r\nbacterial infection, and, in fact, the diseases of filth, such\r\nas dysentery, tuberculosis, children's complaints and others,\r\ndecreased in a surprising manner, while yellow fever seemed to\r\nhave been little affected if at all.\r\n\r\nEvidently, a more thorough overhauling of the matter was\r\nnecessary to arrive at the truth, and while the question of\r\nSanarelli and his claims was practically put aside,\r\nSurgeon-General Sternberg, recognizing the importance of the\r\nwork before us and that its proportions were such as to render\r\nthe outcome more satisfactory by the cooperation of several\r\ninvestigators in the same direction, wisely decided to create a\r\nboard for the purpose and so caused the following to be issued:\r\n\r\n Special Orders  No. 122\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\nADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n   WASHINGTON, May 24, 1900\r\n\r\n                              Extract\r\n\r\n34. By direction of the Secretary of War, a board of medical\r\nofficers is appointed to meet at Camp Columbia, Quemados, Cuba,\r\nfor the purpose of pursuing scientific investigations with\r\nreference to the infectious diseases prevalent on the Island of\r\nCuba. Detail for the board:\r\n\r\nMajor Walter Reed, surgeon, U. S. Army;\r\nActing Assistant Surgeon James Carroll, U. S. Army;\r\nActing Assistant Surgeon Aristides Agramonte, U. S. Army;\r\nActing Assistant Surgeon Jesse W. Lazear, U. S. Army.\r\n\r\nThe board will act under general instructions to be\r\ncommunicated to Major Reed by the Surgeon General of the Army.\r\n                   By command of MAJOR GENERAL MILES,\r\n                                   H. C. CORBIN,\r\n                                      Adjutant General\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to the reader to learn who these men were\r\nand the reasons why they were probably selected for the work.\r\n\r\nMajor Reed, the first member in the order of appointment, was\r\nthe ranking officer and therefore the chairman of the board. He\r\nwas a regular army officer, at the time curator of the Army\r\nMedical Museum in Washington and a bacteriologist of some\r\nrepute. He deservedly enjoyed the full confidence of the\r\nsurgeon general, besides his personal friendship and regard.\r\nReed was a man of charming personality, honest and above board.\r\nEvery one who knew him loved him and confided in him. A\r\npolished gentleman and a scientist of the highest order, he was\r\npeculiarly fitted for the work before him.\r\n\r\nDr. James Carroll, the second member of the board, was a\r\nself-made man, having risen from the ranks through his own\r\nefforts: while a member of the Army Hospital Corps he studied\r\nmedicine and subsequently took several courses at Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity in the laboratory branches. At the time of his\r\nappointment to the board he had been for several years an able\r\nassistant to Major Reed. Personally, Carroll was industrious\r\nand of a retiring disposition.\r\n\r\nDr. Jesse W. Lazear was the fourth member of the board. He had\r\ngraduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons (Columbia\r\nUniversity) in the same class as the writer, in 1892, and had\r\nafterwards studied abroad and at Johns Hopkins. Lazear had\r\nreceived special training in the investigation of mosquitoes\r\nwith reference to malaria and other diseases. Stationed at\r\nColumbia Barracks, he had been in Cuba several months before\r\nthe board was convened, in charge of the hospital laboratory at\r\nthe camp. A thorough university man, he was the type of the old\r\nsouthern gentleman, kind, affectionate, dignified, with a high\r\nsense of honor, a staunch friend and a faithful soldier.\r\n\r\nThe writer was the third member of the Army Board. Born in Cuba\r\nduring the ten years' war, while still a child, my father\r\nhaving been killed in battle against the Spanish, I was taken\r\nto the United States and educated in the public schools and in\r\nthe College of the City of New York, graduating from the\r\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons in 1892. At the breaking out\r\nof the war I was assistant bacteriologist in the New York\r\nHealth Department. The subject of yellow fever research was my\r\nchief object from the outset, and, at the time the board was\r\nappointed, I was in charge of the laboratory of the Division of\r\nCuba, in Havana.\r\n\r\nIt may be readily seen from the brief sketch regarding the\r\nseveral members that the components of the yellow-fever board\r\nreally constituted a perfectly consistent body, for the reason,\r\nmainly, that they were all men trained in the special field\r\nwherein their labors were to be so fruitful and that before\r\ntheir appointment to the board they had been more or less\r\nassociated in scientific work.\r\n\r\nFIRST PART OF THE WORK OF THE BOARD\r\n\r\nMy first knowledge of the existence of the board was had\r\nthrough the following letter from my friend Major Reed:\r\n\r\n                                     WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n                           SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n                            WASHINGTON, May 25, 1900\r\n\r\nDR. A. AGRAMONTE,\r\nAct'g Asst. Surgeon U. S. A.,\r\nMilitary Hospital No. 1,\r\nHavana, Cuba\r\n\r\nMy dear Doctor: An order issued yesterday from the War\r\nDepartment calls for a board of medical officers for the\r\ninvestigation of acute infectious diseases occurring on the\r\nIsland of Cuba. The board consists of Carroll, yourself, Lazear\r\nand the writer. It will be our duty, under verbal instructions\r\nfrom the Surgeon General, to continue the investigation of the\r\ncausation of yellow fever. The Surgeon General expects us to\r\nmake use of your laboratory at Military Hospital No. 1 and\r\nLazear's laboratory at Camp Columbia.\r\n\r\nAccording to the present plan, Carroll and I will be quartered\r\nat Camp Columbia. We propose to bring with us our microscopes\r\nand such other apparatus as may be necessary for the\r\nbacteriological and pathological work. If, therefore, you will\r\npromptly send me a list of the apparatus on hand in your\r\nlaboratory, it will serve as a very great help in enabling us\r\nto decide as to what we should include in our equipment. Any\r\nsuggestions that you may have to make will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCarroll and I expect to leave New York, on transport, between\r\nthe 15th and 20th of June and are looking forward, with much\r\npleasure, to our association with you and Lazear in this\r\ninteresting work. As far as I can see we have a year or two of\r\nwork before us.\r\n\r\nTrusting you will let me hear from you promptly, and with best\r\nwishes,\r\n                   Sincerely yours,\r\n                        (Signed)\r\n                    WALTER REED\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of June 25, 1900, the four officers met for\r\nthe first time in their new capacity, on the veranda of the\r\nofficers' quarters at Columbia Barracks Hospital. We were fully\r\nappreciative of the trust and aware of the responsibility\r\nplaced upon us and with a feeling akin to reverence heard the\r\ninstructions which Major Reed had brought from the surgeon\r\ngeneral; they comprised the investigation also of malaria,\r\nleprosy and unclassified febrile conditions, and were given\r\nwith such detail and precision as only a man of General\r\nSternberg's experience and knowledge in such matters could have\r\nprepared. After deciding upon the first steps to be taken, it\r\nwas unanimously agreed that whatever the result of our\r\ninvestigation should turn out to be, it was to be considered as\r\nthe work of the board as a body, and never as the outcome of\r\nany individual effort; that each one of us was to work in\r\nharmony with a general plan, though at liberty to carry out his\r\nindividual methods of research. We were to meet whenever\r\nnecessary, Drs. Reed, Carroll and Lazear to remain at the\r\nBarracks Hospital and I to stay in charge of the laboratory in\r\nHavana, at the Military Hospital, where I also had a ward into\r\nwhich yellow-fever cases from the city were often admitted.\r\n\r\nWork was begun at once. Fortunately for our purpose, an\r\nepidemic of yellow fever existed in the town of Quemados, in\r\nclose proximity to the military reservation of Camp Columbia.\r\nEven before the arrival of Reed and Carroll, Lazear and I had\r\nbeen studying its spread, following the cases very closely;\r\nsubsequently a few autopsies were made by me, Carroll making\r\ncultures from the various tissues and Lazear securing fragments\r\nfor microscopical examination; a careful record was kept and\r\nthe results noted; cases gradually became less in number as the\r\nepidemic slowly died out, about the middle of August.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a rather severe outbreak of yellow fever had\r\noccurred in Santa Clara, a city in the interior of the island,\r\nhaving invaded the garrison and caused the death of several\r\nsoldiers; as the origin of the infection was shrouded in\r\nmystery, and cases continued to appear among the troops even\r\nafter they had moved out of the town, it was agreed that I\r\nshould endeavor to trace the source of the epidemic and aid the\r\nmedical authorities in establishing whatever preventive\r\nmeasures might seem proper. This service is here recorded\r\nbecause in the general discussion of the start and course of\r\nthe epidemic with Dr. J. Hamilton Stone, the officer in charge\r\nof the military hospital, we incidentally spoke of the possible\r\nagency of insects in spreading the disease, pointing\r\nparticularly in this direction the fact of the infection of a\r\ntrooper who, suffering from another complaint, occupied a bed\r\nin a ward across the yard from where a yellow fever case had\r\ndeveloped two weeks before.\r\n\r\nThe infection of the city of Santa Clara had evidently taken\r\nplace from Havana, distant only one night's journey by train.\r\nCaptain Stone, a particularly able officer, had already\r\ninstituted effective quarantine measures before my arrival, so\r\nthat I only remained there a few days.\r\n\r\nBut as to the actual cause of the disease we were still\r\nentirely at sea; it helped us little to know that a man could\r\nbe infected in Havana, take the train for a town in the\r\ninterior and start an outbreak there in the course of time.\r\n\r\nUpon rejoining my colleagues (July 2) we resumed our routine\r\ninvestigations; not only in Quemados, where the disease was\r\nbeing stamped out, but also in Havana, at \"Las Animas\" Hospital\r\nand at Military Hospital No. 1, where my laboratory (the\r\ndivision laboratory) was located. There was no scarcity of\r\nmaterial and the two members who until then had never seen a\r\ncase of yellow fever (Reed and Carroll) had ample opportunity,\r\nand took advantage of it, to become acquainted with the many\r\ndetails of its clinical picture which escape the ordinary\r\npractitioner, the knowledge and the appreciation of which, in\r\ntheir relative value, give the right to the title of \"expert.\"\r\n\r\nSince the later part of June, reports had been coming to\r\nheadquarters of an extraordinary increase of sickness among the\r\nsoldiers stationed at Pinar del Rio, the capital of the extreme\r\nwestern province, and very soon the great mortality from\r\nso-called \"pernicious malarial fever\" attracted the attention\r\nof the chief surgeon, Captain A. N. Stark, who, after\r\nconsulting with Major Reed, ordered me to go there and\r\ninvestigate. A man had died, supposedly from malaria, just\r\nbefore my arrival on the afternoon of July 19. The autopsy\r\nwhich I performed at once showed me that yellow fever had been\r\nthe cause of his death, and a search through the military\r\nhospital wards revealed the existence of several unrecognized\r\ncases being treated as malaria; a consultation held with the\r\nmedical officer in charge showed me his absolute incapacity, as\r\nhe was under the influence of opium most of the time (he\r\ncommitted suicide several months afterwards), and so I\r\ntelegraphed the condition of things to headquarters; in answer\r\nI received the following:\r\n\r\n                                CHIEF SURGEON'S OFFICE,\r\n                 HDQRS.

In answer to my telegram asking for\r\nofficial support, I received the following:\r\n\r\n                           CHIEF SURGEON'S OFFICE,\r\n              HDQRS. DEPT.

STARK,\r\n                                          Chief Surgeon\r\n\r\nWhen Major Reed came to Pinar del Rio (July 21) I had, the day\r\nbefore, established a separate yellow-fever hospital, under\r\ntents, attended by some of the men who had already passed an\r\nattack and were thus immune. The Major and I went over the\r\nground very carefully, we studied the sick report for two\r\nmonths back, fruitlessly trying to place the blame upon the\r\nfirst case. I well remember how, as we stood in the men's\r\nsleeping quarters, surrounded by a hundred beds, from several\r\nof which fatal cases had been removed, we were struck by the\r\nfact that the later occupants had not developed the disease. In\r\nconnection with this, and particularly interesting, was the\r\ncase of a soldier prisoner who had been confined to the\r\nguard-house since June 6; he showed the first symptoms of\r\nyellow fever on the twelfth and died on the eighteenth; none of\r\nthe other eight prisoners in the same cell caught the\r\ninfection, though one of them continued to sleep in the same\r\nbunk previously occupied by his dead comrade. More than this;\r\nthe three men who handled the clothing and washed the linen of\r\nthose who had died during the last month were still in perfect\r\nhealth. Here we seemed to be in the presence of the same\r\nphenomenon remarked by Captain Stone in reference to his case\r\nat Santa Clara, and before that by several investigators of\r\nyellow fever epidemics; the infection at a distance, the\r\nharmless condition of bedding and clothing of the sick; the\r\npossibility that some insect might be concerned in spreading\r\nthe disease deeply impressed us and Major Reed mentions the\r\ncircumstance in his later writings. This was really the first\r\ntime that the mosquito transmission theory was seriously\r\nconsidered by members of the board, and it was decided that,\r\nalthough discredited by the repeated failure of its most ardent\r\nsupporter, Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, of Havana, to demonstrate it,\r\nthe matter should be taken up by the board and thoroughly\r\nsifted.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the troops out of Pinar del Rio was the means of\r\nat once checking the propagation of the disease.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of August the board met and after due\r\ndeliberation determined to investigate mosquitoes in connection\r\nwith the spread of yellow fever. As Dr. Lazear was the only one\r\nof us who had had any experience in mosquito work, Major Reed\r\nthought proper that he should take charge of this part of the\r\ninvestigation in the beginning, while we, Carroll and I,\r\ncontinued with the other work on hand, at the same time\r\ngradually becoming familiar with the manipulations necessary in\r\ndealing with the insects.\r\n\r\nA visit was now made to Dr. Finlay, who, much elated at the\r\nnews that the board was about to investigate his pet theory,\r\nthe transmission of yellow fever from man to man by mosquitoes,\r\nvery kindly explained to us many points regarding the life of\r\nthe one kind he thought most guilty and ended by furnishing us\r\nwith a number of eggs which, laid by a female mosquito nearly a\r\nmonth before, had remained unhatched on the inside of a half\r\nempty bowl of water in his library.\r\n\r\nMuch to our disappointment and regret, during the first week of\r\nAugust, Major Reed was recalled to Washington that he might, in\r\ncollaboration with Drs. Vaughan and Shakespeare, complete the\r\nreport upon \"Typhoid Fever in the Army.\" Thus we were deprived\r\nof his able counsel during the first part of the mosquito\r\nresearch. Major Reed was detained longer than he expected and\r\ncould not return to Cuba until early in October, several days\r\nafter Lazear's death.\r\n\r\nThe mosquito eggs obtained from Dr. Finlay hatched out in due\r\ntime; the insects sent to Washington for their exact\r\nclassification were declared by Dr. L. O. Howard, entomologist\r\nto the Agricultural Department, to be Culex fasciatus. Later,\r\nthey have been called Stegomyia fasciatus and now go under the\r\nname of Stegomyia calopus (Aedes cal.).\r\n\r\nLazear applied some of these mosquitoes to cases of yellow\r\nfever at \"Las Animas\" Hospital, keeping them in separate glass\r\ntubes properly labeled, and every thing connected with their\r\nbitings was carefully recorded; the original batch soon died\r\nand the work was carried on with subsequent generations from\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThe lack of material at Quemados caused us to remove our field\r\nof action to Havana, where cases of yellow fever continued to\r\nappear. We met almost every day at \"Las Animas\" Hospital, where\r\nLazear was trying to infect his mosquitoes, or now and then I\r\nperformed autopsy upon a case, and Carroll secured sufficient\r\ncultures to last him for several days of bacteriological\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nConsidering that, in case our surmise as to the insect's action\r\nshould prove to be correct, it was dangerous to introduce\r\ninfected mosquitoes amongst a population of 1,400 non-immunes\r\nat Camp Columbia, Dr. Lazear thought best to keep his\r\npresumably infected insects in my laboratory at the Military\r\nHospital No. 1, from where he carried them back and forth to\r\nthe patients who were periodically bitten.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, after the mosquitoes fed upon the yellow fever\r\npatients, they were applied, at intervals of two or three days,\r\nto whoever would consent to run the risk of contracting yellow\r\nfever in this way; needless to say, current opinion was against\r\nthis probability and as time passed and numerous individuals\r\nwho had been bitten by insects which had previously fed upon\r\nyellow fever blood remained unaffected, I must confess that\r\neven the members of the board, who were rather sanguine in\r\ntheir expectations, became somewhat discouraged and their faith\r\nin success very much shaken.\r\n\r\nNo secret was made of our attempts to infect mosquitoes; in\r\nfact many local physicians became intensely interested, and\r\nLazear and his tubes were the subject of much comment on the\r\npart of the Havana doctors, who nearly twenty years before had\r\nwatched and laughed at Dr. Finlay, then bent apparently upon\r\nthe same quest in which we were now engaged. Dr. Finlay himself\r\nwas somewhat chagrined when he learned of our failure to infect\r\nany one with mosquitoes, but, like a true believer, was\r\ninclined to attribute this negative result more to some defect\r\nin our technique than to any flaw in his favorite theory.\r\n\r\nAlthough the board had thought proper to run the same risks, if\r\nany, as those who willingly and knowingly subjected themselves\r\nto the bites of the supposedly infected insects, opportunity\r\ndid not offer itself readily, since Major Reed was away in\r\nWashington and Carroll, at Camp Columbia, engrossed in his\r\nbacteriological investigations came to Havana only when an\r\nautopsy was on hand or a particularly interesting case came up\r\nfor study. I was considered an immune, a fact that I would not\r\nlike to have tested, for though born in the island of Cuba, I\r\nhad practically lived all my life away from a yellow fever\r\nzone; it was therefore presumed that I ran no risk in allowing\r\nmosquitoes to bite me, as I frequently did, just to feed them\r\nblood, whether they had previously sucked from yellow fever\r\ncases or not. And so, time passed and several Americans and\r\nSpaniards had subjected themselves in a sporting mood to be\r\nbitten by the infected (?) mosquitoes without causing any\r\nuntoward results, when Lazear applied to himself (August 16,\r\n1900) a mosquito which ten days before had fed upon a mild case\r\nof yellow fever in the fifth day of his disease; the fact that\r\nno infection resulted, for Lazear continued in excellent health\r\nfor a space of time far beyond the usual period of incubation,\r\nserved to discredit the mosquito theory in the opinion of the\r\ninvestigators to a degree almost beyond redemption, and the\r\nmost enthusiastic, Dr. Lazear himself, was almost ready to\r\n\"throw up the sponge.\"\r\n\r\nI had as laboratory attendant a young American, a private\r\nbelonging to the Hospital Corps of the Army, who more than once\r\nhad bared his arm to allow a weak mosquito a fair meal with\r\nwhich to regain its apparently waning strength; Loud, for that\r\nwas his name, derided the idea that such a little beast could\r\ndo so much harm as we seemed ready to accuse it of, although he\r\nwas familiar with the destruction caused by bacteria, but then,\r\nhe used to say, \"bacterial work in armies of more than a\r\nmillion bugs at the same time and no one would be d---- fool\r\nenough to let more than one or two gnats sting him at once.\"\r\n\r\nThis state of things, the gradual loss of faith in the danger\r\nwhich mosquitoes seemed to possess, led Dr. Lazear to relax a\r\nlittle and become less scrupulous in his care of the insects,\r\nand often, after applying them to patients, if pressed for\r\ntime, he would take them away with him to his laboratory at\r\nColumbia Barracks, where, the season being then quite warm,\r\nthey could be kept as comfortably as at the Military Hospital\r\nlaboratory. Thus it happened that on the twenty-seventh of\r\nAugust he had spent the whole morning at \"Las Animas\" Hospital\r\ngetting his mosquitoes to take yellow-fever blood: the\r\nprocedure was very simple; each insect was contained in a glass\r\ntube covered by a wad of cotton, the same as is done with\r\nbacterial cultures. As the mouth of the tube is turned\r\ndownwards, the insect usually flies towards the bottom of the\r\ntube (upwards), then the latter is uncovered rapidly and the\r\nopen mouth placed upon the forearm or the abdomen of the\r\npatient; after a few moments the mosquito drops upon the skin\r\nand if hungry will immediately start operations; when full, by\r\ngently shaking the tube, the insect is made to fly upwards\r\nagain and the cotton plug replaced without difficulty. It so\r\nhappened that this rather tedious work, on the day above\r\nmentioned, lasted until nearly the noon hour, so that Lazear,\r\ninstead of leaving the tubes at the Military Hospital, took\r\nthem all with him to Camp Columbia: among them was one insect\r\nthat for some reason or other had failed to take blood when\r\noffered to it at \"Las Animas\" Hospital.\r\n\r\nThis mosquito had been hatched in the laboratory and in due\r\ntime fed upon yellow-fever blood from a severe case on August\r\n15, that is, twelve days before, the patient then being in the\r\nsecond day of his illness; also at three other times, six days,\r\nfour days and two days before. Of course, at the time, no\r\nparticular attention had been drawn to this insect, except that\r\nit refused to suck blood when tempted that morning.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon that day, as Carroll and Lazear were in the\r\nlaboratory attending to their respective work, the conversation\r\nturning upon the mosquitoes and their apparent harmlessness,\r\nLazear remarked how one of them had failed to take blood, at\r\nwhich Carroll thought that he might try to feed it, as\r\notherwise it was liable to die before next day (the insect\r\nseemed weak and tired); the tube was carefully held first by\r\nLazear and then by Carroll himself, for a considerable length\r\nof time, upon his forearm, before the mosquito decided to\r\nintroduce its proboscis.\r\n\r\nThis insect was again fed from a yellow fever case at \"Las\r\nAnimas\" Hospital on the twenty-ninth, two days later, Dr.\r\nCarroll being present, though not feeling very well, as it was\r\nafterwards ascertained.\r\n\r\nWe three left the yellow-fever hospital together that\r\nafternoon; I got down from the doherty-wagon where the road\r\nforks, going on to the Military Hospital, while Carroll and\r\nLazear continued on their way to Camp Columbia. On the\r\nfollowing day, Lazear telephoned to me in the evening, to say\r\nthat Carroll was down with a chill after a sea bath taken at\r\nthe beach, a mile and a half from Camp, and that they suspected\r\nhe had malaria; we therefore made an appointment to examine his\r\nblood together the following morning.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Camp Columbia I found that Carroll had been\r\nexamining his own blood early that morning, not finding any\r\nmalarial parasites; he told me he thought he had \"caught cold\"\r\nat the beach: his suffused face, blood-shot eyes and general\r\nappearance, in spite of his efforts at gaiety and unconcern,\r\nshocked me beyond words. The possibility of his having yellow\r\nfever did not occur to him just then; when it did, two days\r\nlater, he declared he must have caught it at my autopsy room in\r\nthe Military Hospital, or at \"Las Animas\" Hospital, where he\r\nhad been two days before taking sick. Although we insisted that\r\nhe should go to bed in his quarters, we could only get him to\r\nrest upon a lounge, until the afternoon, when he felt too sick\r\nand had to take to his bed.\r\n\r\nLazear and I were almost panic-stricken when we realized that\r\nCarroll had yellow fever. We searched for all possibilities\r\nthat might throw the blame for his infection upon any other\r\nsource than the mosquito which bit him four days before;\r\nLazear, poor fellow, in his desire to exculpate himself, as he\r\nrelated to me the details of Carroll's mosquito experiment,\r\nrepeatedly mentioned the fact that he himself had been bitten\r\ntwo weeks before without any effect therefrom and finally, what\r\nseemed to relieve his mind to some extent, was the thought that\r\nCarroll offered himself to feed the mosquito and that he held\r\nthe tube upon his own arm until the work was consummated.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned before that, as Lazear and I, vaguely hoping\r\nto find malarial parasites in Carroll's blood, sat looking into\r\nour microscopes that morning, the idea that the mosquito was\r\nwhat brought him down gradually took hold of our minds, but as\r\nour colleague had been exposed to infection in other ways, by\r\nvisiting the yellow fever hospital \"Las Animas,\" as well as the\r\ninfected city of Havana, it was necessary to subject that same\r\nmosquito to another test and hence the inoculation of Private\r\nDean, which is described in the opening chapter of this\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nTERMINATION OF THE FIRST SERIES OF MOSQUITO EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF LAZEAR.\r\n\r\nThe month of September, 1900, was fraught with worry and\r\nanxiety: what with Carroll's and Private Dean's attacks of\r\nyellow fever and Major Reed's inability to return, Lazear and I\r\nwere well-nigh on the verge of distraction. Private Dean was\r\nnot married, but Carroll's wife and children, a thousand miles\r\naway, awaited in the greatest anguish the daily cablegram which\r\ntold them the condition of the husband and father, who was\r\nfighting for life, sometimes the victim of the wildest delirium\r\ncaused by consuming fever, at others almost about to collapse,\r\nuntil one day, the worst of the disease being over, the wires\r\nmust have thrilled at our announcement, \"Carroll out of\r\ndanger.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately both he and Dean made an uninterrupted recovery,\r\nbut we were still to undergo the severest trial, a sorrow\r\ncompared to which the fearful days of Carroll's sickness lose\r\nall importance and dwindle almost into insignificance.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the eighteenth my friend and classmate\r\nLazear, whom in spite of our short intercourse I had learned to\r\nrespect and in every way appreciate most highly, complained\r\nthat he was feeling \"out of sorts.\" He remained all day about\r\nthe officers' quarters and that night suffered a moderate\r\nchill. I saw him the next day with all the signs of a severe\r\nattack of yellow fever.\r\n\r\nCarroll was already walking about, though enfeebled by his late\r\nsickness, and we both plied Lazear with questions as to the\r\norigin of his trouble; I believe we affectionately chided him\r\nfor not having taken better care of himself. Lazear assured us\r\nthat he had not experimented upon himself, that is, that he had\r\nnot been bitten by any of the purposely infected mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nAfter the case of Dean so plainly demonstrated the certainty of\r\nmosquito infection, we had agreed not to tempt fate by trying\r\nany more upon ourselves, and even I determined that no mosquito\r\nshould bite me if I could prevent it, since the subject of my\r\nimmunity was one that could not be sustained on scientific\r\ngrounds; at the same time, we felt that we had been called upon\r\nto accomplish such work as did not justify our taking risks\r\nwhich then seemed really unnecessary. This we impressed upon\r\nMajor Reed when he joined us in October and for this reason he\r\nwas never bitten by infected mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nLazear told us, however, that while at \"Las Animas\" Hospital\r\nthe previous Thursday (five days before), as he was holding a\r\ntest-tube with a mosquito upon a man's abdomen, some other\r\ninsect which was flying about the room rested upon his hand; at\r\nfirst, he said, he was tempted to frighten it away, but, as it\r\nhad settled before he had time to notice it, he decided to let\r\nit fill and then capture it; besides, he did not want to move\r\nin fear of disturbing the insect contained in his tube, which\r\nwas feeding voraciously. Before Lazear could prevent it, the\r\nmosquito that bit him on the hand had flown away. He told us in\r\nhis lucid moments, that, although Carroll's and Dean's cases\r\nhad convinced him of the mosquito's role in transmitting yellow\r\nfever, the fact that no infection had resulted from his own\r\ninoculation the month before had led him to believe himself, to\r\na certain extent, immune.\r\n\r\nHow can I describe the agony of suspense which racked our souls\r\nduring those six days? It seemed to us as though a life was\r\nbeing offered in sacrifice for the thousands which it was to\r\ncontribute in saving. Across the span of thirteen years the\r\nmemory of the last moments comes to me most vividly and\r\nthrilling, when the light of reason left his brain and shut out\r\nof his mind the torturing thought of the loving wife and\r\ndaughter far away, and of the unborn child who was to find\r\nitself fatherless on coming to the world.\r\n\r\nTuesday, the twenty-fifth of September saw the end of a life\r\nfull of promise; one more name, that of Jesse W. Lazear, was\r\ngraven upon the portals of immortality. And we may feel justly\r\nproud for having had it, in any way, associated with our own.\r\n\r\nThe state of mind in which this calamity left us may better be\r\nimagined than described. The arrival of Major Reed several days\r\nafter in a great measure came to relieve the tensity of our\r\nnerves and render us a degree of moral support of which we were\r\nsorely in need.\r\n\r\nLazear's death naturally served to dampen our fruition at the\r\nsuccess of the mosquito experiments, but, this notwithstanding,\r\nwhen the facts were known we were the subjects of much\r\ncongratulation and the question whether the theory had been\r\ndefinitely demonstrated or not was the theme of conversation\r\neverywhere, about Havana and Camp Columbia particularly. We\r\nfully realized that three cases, two experimental and one\r\naccidental, were not sufficient proof, and that the medical\r\nworld was sure to look with doubt upon any opinion based on\r\nsuch meager evidence; besides, in the case of Carroll, we had\r\nbeen unable to exclude the possibility of other means of\r\ninfection, so that we really had but one case, Dean's, that we\r\ncould present as clearly demonstrative and beyond question. In\r\nspite of this, we thought that the results warranted their\r\npresentation in the shape of a \"Preliminary Note,\" and after\r\nall the data were carefully collected from Lazear's records and\r\nthose at the Military Hospital, a short paper was prepared\r\nwhich the Major had the privilege to read at the meeting of the\r\nAmerican Public Health Association, held on October 24, in the\r\ncity of Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose Major Reed went to the States two weeks after\r\nhis return to Cuba, and Carroll also took a short leave of\r\nabsence so as to fully recuperate, in preparation for the\r\nsecond series of inoculations which we had arranged to\r\nundertake, after the Indianapolis meeting.\r\n\r\nThese inoculations, according to our program, were to be made\r\nupon volunteers who should consent to suffer a period of\r\nprevious quarantine at some place to be selected in due time,\r\naway from any possibility of yellow fever.\r\n\r\nIt so happened then that I was left the only member of the\r\nboard in Cuba and, under instructions from Major Reed, I began\r\nto breed mosquitoes and infect them, as Lazear used to do,\r\nwherever cases occurred, keeping them at my laboratory in the\r\nMilitary Hospital No. 1. Major Reed had also asked me to look\r\nabout for a proper location wherein to continue the work upon\r\nhis return.\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOSQUITO THEORY\r\n\r\nThe possible agency of insects in the propagation of yellow\r\nfever was thought of by more than one observer, from a very\r\nearly period in the history of this disease. For instance,\r\nRush, of Philadelphia, in 1797, noticed the excessive abundance\r\nof mosquitoes during that awful epidemic. Subsequently, several\r\nothers spoke of the coincidence of gnats or mosquitoes and\r\nyellow fever, but without ascribing any direct relation to the\r\none regarding the other. Of course, man-to-man infection\r\nthrough the sole intervention of an insect was a thing entirely\r\ninconceivable and therefore unthought of until very recently,\r\nand in truth the discovery, as far as yellow fever is\r\nconcerned, was the result of a slow process of evolution of the\r\nfundamental fact, taken in connection with similar findings, in\r\nother diseases.\r\n\r\nThe earliest direct reference is found in the writings of Dr.\r\nNott, of Mobile, Ala., who in 1848 suggested that the\r\ndissemination of the yellow fever poison was evidently by means\r\nof some insect \"that remained very close to the ground.\" But\r\nthe first who positively pointed to the mosquito as the\r\nspreader of yellow fever, who showed that absence of mosquitoes\r\nprecluded the existence of the disease and who prescribed the\r\nready means to stamp it out, by fumigation and by preventing\r\nthe bites of the insects, was Dr. Louis D. Beauperthuy, a\r\nFrench physician, then located in Venezuela. The writer has an\r\noriginal copy of his paper, published in 1853, where he fastens\r\nthe guilt upon the domestic mosquitoes, believing, in accord\r\nwith the prevailing teachings of medical science, that the\r\nmosquitoes infected themselves by contact or feeding upon the\r\norganic matter found in the stagnant waters where they are\r\nhatched, afterwards inoculating the victims by their sting. He\r\nrecognized the fact that yellow fever is not contagious and\r\ntherefore could not think of the possibility of man-to-man\r\ninfection, as we know it to-day. The keenest observer was this\r\nman Beauperthuy, and, even at that benighted time in the\r\nhistory of tropical medicine, made most interesting studies of\r\nthe blood and tissues, employing the microscope and the\r\nchemical reactions in his research. No one believed him, and a\r\ncommission appointed to report upon his views said that they\r\nwere inadmissible and all but declared him insane.\r\n\r\nThis field of investigation remained dormant for a\r\ncomparatively long period of time. Meanwhile another medical\r\nwriter, Dr. Greenville Dowell, mentions in 1876, that \"if we\r\ncompare the effect of heat and cold on gnats and mosquitoes\r\nwith yellow fever, it will be difficult to believe it is of the\r\nsame nature, as it is controlled by the same natural laws.\"\r\nSoon after this, in 1879, the first conclusive proof of the\r\ndirect transmission of a disease from man-to-man was presented\r\nby the father of tropical medicine, Sir Patrick Manson, with\r\nregard to filaria, a blood infection that often causes the\r\nrepulsive condition known as elephantiasis and which the\r\nmosquito takes from man and after a short time gives over to\r\nanother subject. This discovery attracted world-wide attention\r\nand many looked again towards the innumerable species of biting\r\ninsects that dwell in the Tropic Zone, as possible carriers of\r\nthe obscure diseases which also prevail in those regions.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, of Havana, in an exhaustive paper\r\nread before the Royal Academy of Sciences, gave as his opinion\r\nthat yellow fever was spread by the bites of mosquitoes\r\n\"directly contaminated by stinging a yellow fever patient (or\r\nperhaps by contact with or feeding from his discharge).\" This\r\nlatter view he held as late as 1900, which, although correct in\r\nthe main fact of the transmission of the germ from a patient to\r\na susceptible person by the mosquito, the modus operandi, as he\r\nconceived it, was entirely erroneous.\r\n\r\nDr. Finlay, unfortunately was unable to produce experimentally\r\na single case of fever that could withstand the mildest\r\ncriticism, so that at the time when the Army Board came to\r\ninvestigate the causes of yellow fever in Cuba, his theory,\r\nthough practically the correct one, had been so much\r\ndiscredited, in a great measure by his own failures, that the\r\nbest-known experts considered it as an ingenious, but wholly\r\nfanciful, one and many thought it a fit subject for humorous\r\nand sarcastic repartee. Finlay also believed, erroneously, that\r\nrepeated bites of contaminated insects might protect against\r\nyellow fever and that the mosquitoes were capable of\r\ntransmitting the germ to the next generation.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful discoveries of Theobald Smith, as to the agency\r\nof ticks in spreading Texas fever of cattle, and those of Ross\r\nand the Italian investigators who showed conclusively that\r\nmalaria was transmitted by a species of mosquito, brought the\r\nknowledge of these various diseases to the point where the Army\r\nBoard took up the investigation of yellow fever.\r\n\r\nSECOND AND FINAL SERIES OF MOSQUITO EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\nMajor Reed came back to Havana in the early part of November,\r\nCarroll following a week after.\r\n\r\nDuring their absence, I had been applying mosquitoes to yellow\r\nfever patients at \"Las Animas\" Hospital, keeping them in my\r\nlaboratory, as it was done at the beginning of the\r\ninvestigation; the season being more advanced, now and then a\r\ncold \"norther\" would blow and my insects suffered very much\r\nthereby, so that I had the greatest trouble in preventing their\r\nuntimely death: to this may be added the difficulty met in\r\nfeeding them blood, for now that I knew their sting was\r\ndangerous, unto death perhaps, I could not allow any\r\nindiscriminate biting, but had to select for the purpose\r\nindividuals who had suffered an attack of the disease and were\r\ntherefore immune.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for an experimental camp became more imperative\r\nas time passed, not only where proper quarantine and isolation\r\ncould be established, but also where the insects intended for\r\nthe inoculations might receive better care. This entailed\r\nconsiderable expense.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, the military governor of the island at that\r\ntime, Brigadier General Leonard Wood, was a man who had\r\nreceived a thorough medical training; broad and clear-minded,\r\nhe fully appreciated the importance of what might be the\r\noutcome of our researches. We found in him the moral support\r\nwhich we so much needed and, further, he promptly placed at the\r\ndisposal of the board sufficient funds with which to carry on\r\nthe experiments to the end. I firmly believe that had other\r\nbeen the circumstances, had a more military and less scientific\r\nman been at the head of the government, the investigation would\r\nhave terminated there and then, and many years would have\r\npassed, with hundreds of lives uselessly sacrificed, before we\r\ncould have attained our present remarkable sanitary triumphs.\r\n\r\nWe immediately set about choosing a location for our camp. I\r\nhad already looked over the ground, preferring the proximity of\r\nCamp Columbia, from where supplies could be easily obtained and\r\nbecause the Military Hospital there could be used for treating\r\nthe cases that we intended to produce; I was therefore\r\nfavorably impressed with the seclusion offered by a spot\r\nsituated a short distance from the main road, in a farm, named\r\nSan Jose, belonging to my friend Dr. Ignacio Rojas, of Havana.\r\nMajor Reed decided upon this place after looking at many others\r\nin the neighborhood, so that on the twentieth of November we\r\ninaugurated our camp, which we named Camp Lazear, in honor to\r\nthe memory of our dead colleague, consisting then of seven army\r\ntents, guarded by a military garrison, composed of men who had\r\nbeen carefully selected by virtue of their previous good record\r\nand their interest in the work to be undertaken.\r\n\r\nFeeling that we had proved, to ourselves at least, the agency\r\nof the mosquito in yellow fever, it became our duty to disprove\r\nthe theory, until then held as a certainty by many authorities,\r\nto the effect that the soiled bedding and clothing, the\r\nsecretions and excreta of patients, were infectious and in some\r\nway carried the germ of the disease. We therefore designed a\r\nsmall wooden building, to be erected a short distance from the\r\ntense, with a capacity of 2,800 cubic feet. The walls and\r\nceiling were absolutely tight, the windows and vestibuled door\r\nscreened and all precautions taken to prevent the entrance of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nInto this, called the \"infected clothing building,\" three beds\r\nand a stove, to maintain a high tropical temperature, were\r\nintroduced; also mattresses and pillows, underwear, pajamas,\r\ntowels, sheets, blankets, etc., soiled with blood and\r\ndischarges from yellow fever cases: these articles were put on\r\nthe beds, hung about the room and packed in a trunk and two\r\nboxes placed there for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe building was finished and equipped on November 30. That\r\nFriday evening, Dr. Robert P. Cook, U. S. Army, with two other\r\nAmerican volunteers, entered it and prepared to pass the night:\r\nthey had instructions to unpack the boxes and trunk, to handle\r\nand shake the clothing and in every way to attempt to\r\ndisseminate the yellow fever poison, in case it was contained\r\nin the various pieces. We watched the proceedings from the\r\noutside, through one of the windows. The foul conditions which\r\ndeveloped upon opening the trunk were of such a character that\r\nthe three men were seen to suddenly rush out of the building\r\ninto the fresh air; one of them was so upset that his stomach\r\nrebelled; yet, after a few minutes, with a courage and\r\ndetermination worthy only of such a cause, they went back into\r\nthe building and passed a more or less sleepless night, in the\r\nmidst of indescribable filth and overwhelming stench.\r\n\r\nFor twenty consecutive nights these men went through the same\r\nperformance; during the day they remained together, occupying a\r\ntent near their sleeping quarters. Dr. Cook, by voluntarily\r\nundergoing such a test, without remuneration whatsoever, proved\r\nhis faith in the mosquito theory; his demonstration of the\r\nharmless character of so-called infected clothing, in yellow\r\nfever, has been of the greatest importance. The other six men\r\n(two of them with Dr. Cook) who were subjected to this test,\r\nreceived each a donation of one hundred dollars for his\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nMany days even before the establishment of the experimental\r\ncamp, the board had heard that several men who knew of our work\r\nwere willing to submit to the inoculations and thus aid in\r\nclearing up the mystery of yellow fever. Two of these require\r\nspecial mention, John R. Kissinger, a private in the Hospital\r\nCorps of the Army, was the first to offer himself most\r\naltruistically, for, as he expressed it, his offer was made\r\nwithout any desire for pecuniary or other consideration and\r\nsolely \"in the interest of humanity and the cause of science,\"\r\nthe other, J. J. Moran, a civilian employee, also stipulated as\r\na condition that he was to receive no pay for his services.\r\nBoth these men, in due time, suffered from yellow fever and\r\nuntil very recently had never obtained any reward for the great\r\nrisk which they ran so voluntarily and praiseworthily.\r\n\r\nKissinger, who after several years' service in the army became\r\ndisabled, is receiving a pension from the government; Moran, I\r\nhope, is still well and in the employ of the Isthmian Canal\r\nCommission, justly enjoying the friendship and confidence of\r\nhis superior officers. The names of Kissinger and Moran should\r\nfigure upon the roll of honor of the U. S. Army.\r\n\r\nOn the day the camp was definitely organized, Kissinger, who\r\nhad not gone outside the military reservation for more than a\r\nmonth, moved into Camp Lazear and received his first bite from\r\na mosquito which evidently was not \"loaded\" for, again on\r\nNovember 23, he was stung by the same insect without result. On\r\nDecember 5, five mosquitoes were applied, which brought about a\r\nmoderate infection in three days. Moran was also bitten by\r\nmosquitoes which were supposed to be infected on November 26\r\nand 29, both times unsuccessfully. As will be seen, he was\r\ninfected later on.\r\n\r\nBy this time we had decided, the weather having cooled\r\nconsiderably, that it was better to keep the mosquitoes at a\r\nhigher temperature and nearer to the men who were to be\r\ninoculated; therefore it was planned to put up another small\r\nwooden structure, which was to be known as the \"Mosquito\r\nBuilding\" in which an artificial temperature could be\r\nmaintained; at my suggestion, the building was so designed that\r\nit might serve to infect individuals; by liberating infected\r\nmosquitoes on the inside and exposing some person to their\r\nstings, we could try to reproduce the infection as we felt it\r\noccurred in nature. Another reason for the mosquito house was\r\nthe need to obviate the transportation of the insects from the\r\nMilitary Hospital, where I kept them, to our camp, which could\r\nnot be easily done without subjecting them to severe injury.\r\nUpon one occasion I was taking four infected mosquitoes in the\r\npocket inside my blouse from the laboratory in Havana to the\r\nexperimental camp, accompanied by my attendant Private Loud;\r\nthe horse which pulled my buggy, a rather spirited animal,\r\nbecoming frightened at a steam roller, as we went around the\r\ncorner of Colon Cemetery, started to race down the hill towards\r\nthe Almendares River: Loud was thrown out by the first\r\ncavortings of the horse, who stood on its hind legs and jumped\r\nseveral times before dashing away, while I held tightly to the\r\ntubes in my pocket, as the buggy upset and left me stranded\r\nupon a sand pile in the middle of the road; the mosquitoes were\r\nquite safe, however, and upon my arrival at Camp Lazear I\r\nturned them over to Carroll for his subsequent care.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty afterwards encountered was the scarcity of\r\nmaterial susceptible to infection, for, although several men\r\nhad expressed a willingness to be inoculated, when the time\r\ncame; they all preferred the \"infected clothing\" experiment to\r\nthe stings of our mosquitoes. We then thought best to secure\r\nlately landed Spaniards, to whom the probable outcome of the\r\ntest might be explained and their consent obtained for a\r\nmonetary consideration. Our method was as follows; as soon as a\r\nload of immigrants arrived, I would go to Tiscornia, the\r\nImmigration Station across the Bay of Havana, and hire eight or\r\nten men, as day laborers, to work in our camp. Once brought in,\r\nthey were bountifully fed, housed under tents, slept under\r\nmosquito-bars and their only work was to pick up loose stones\r\nfrom the grounds, during eight hours of the day, with plenty of\r\nrest between. In the meantime, as the days of observation\r\npassed, I carefully questioned them as to their antecedents,\r\nfamily history and the diseases which they might have suffered;\r\nthose who had lived in Cuba or any other tropical country\r\nbefore were discarded at once and also those who were under age\r\nor had a family dependent upon them. When the selection was\r\nfinally made, the matter of the experiment was put to them.\r\nNaturally, they all felt more or less that they were running\r\nthe risk of getting yellow fever when they came to Cuba and so\r\nwere not at all averse to allow themselves to be bitten by\r\nmosquitoes: they were paid one hundred dollars for this, and\r\nanother equal sum if, as a result of the biting experiment,\r\nthey developed yellow fever. Needless to say, no reference was\r\nmade to any possible funeral expenses. A written consent was\r\nobtained from each one, so that our moral responsibility was to\r\na certain extent lessened. Of course, only the healthiest\r\nspecimens were experimented upon.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that some reporter discovered what we were\r\nabout, or perhaps some invidious person misrepresented the\r\nfacts; at any rate, on the twenty-first of November a Spanish\r\nnewspaper appeared with flaring headlines denouncing the\r\nAmerican doctors who were taking advantage of the poor\r\nimmigrants and experimenting with them by injecting all sorts\r\nof poisons! It called upon the Spanish consul to look after his\r\nsubjects. In view of this we felt that if such campaign\r\ncontinued, in a short time it would either make it impossible\r\nto secure subjects or cause diplomatic pressure to be exerted\r\nagainst the continuance of our experiments. It was thought best\r\nto \"beard the lion in his den\" so the three of us called upon\r\nthe consul the following day. He was surprised to hear one of\r\nus address him in his own language, having taken us all for\r\nAmericans on first sight, and when I explained to him our\r\nmethod of procedure and showed him the signed contracts with\r\nthe men, being an intelligent man himself, he had no objections\r\nto offer and told us to go ahead and not bother about any howl\r\nthe papers might make.\r\n\r\nThe first three cases (two of them Spaniards) which we produced\r\ncame down with yellow fever within a very short period, from\r\nDecember 8 to 13; it will therefore not surprise the reader to\r\nknow that when the fourth case developed on December 15, and\r\nwas carried out of the camp to the hospital, it caused a\r\nveritable panic among the remaining Spaniards, who, renouncing\r\nthe five hundred pesetas that each had in view, as Major Reed\r\nvery aptly put it, \"lost all interest in the progress of\r\nscience and incontinentally severed their connection with Camp\r\nLazear.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was a rich source to draw from, and the unexpected\r\nstampede only retarded our work for a short time. Our\r\nartificial epidemic of yellow fever was temporarily suspended\r\nwhile a new batch of susceptible material was brought in,\r\nobserved and selected. The next case for that reason was not\r\nproduced upon a Spaniard until December 30.\r\n\r\nIn the face of the negative experiments with supposedly\r\ncontaminated articles, it rested with us to show how a house\r\nbecame infected and for this purpose the main part of the\r\n\"mosquito building\" was utilized.\r\n\r\nThis chamber was divided into two compartments by a double\r\nwire-screen partition, which effectually prevented mosquitoes\r\non one side from passing to the other; of course there were no\r\nmosquitoes there to begin with, as the section of the building\r\nused for breeding and keeping them was entirely separated from\r\nthe other, and there could be no communication between them.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 21, a jar containing fifteen hungry\r\nmosquitoes, that had previously stung cases of yellow fever,\r\nwas introduced and uncovered in the larger compartment, where a\r\nbed, with all linen perfectly sterilized, was ready for\r\noccupancy. A few minutes after, Mr. Moran, dressed as though\r\nabout to retire for the night, entered the room and threw\r\nhimself upon the bed for half an hour; during this time two\r\nother men and Major Reed remained in the other compartment,\r\nseparated from Moran only by the wire-screen partition. Seven\r\nmosquitoes were soon at work upon the young man's arms and\r\nface; he then came out, but returned in the afternoon, when\r\nfive other insects bit him in less than twenty minutes. The\r\nnext day, at the same hour of the afternoon, Moran entered the\r\n\"mosquito building\" for the third time and remained on the bed\r\nfor fifteen minutes, allowing three mosquitoes to bite his\r\nhands. The room was then securely locked, but the two Americans\r\ncontinued to sleep in the other compartment for nearly three\r\nweeks, without experiencing any ill effects.\r\n\r\nPromptly on Christmas morning Moran, who had not been exposed\r\nto infection except for his entrance into the \"mosquito\r\nbuilding\" as described, came down with a well-marked attack of\r\nyellow fever.\r\n\r\nThe temperature in this room, where these mosquitoes had been\r\nreleased, was kept rather high and a vessel with water was\r\nprovided, where they might lay their eggs if so inclined, but\r\nnotwithstanding all these precautions, it was subsequently\r\nfound that the insects had been attacked by ants, so that by\r\nthe end of the month only one of the fifteen mosquitoes\r\nremained alive.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to detail here how seven other men were\r\nsubjected to the sting of our infected mosquitoes, of which\r\nnumber five developed the disease, but it may be interesting to\r\nnote that two of these men had been previously exposed in the\r\n\"infected clothing building\" without their becoming infected,\r\nshowing that they were susceptible to yellow fever after all.\r\n\r\nThe evidence so far seemed to show that the mosquito could only\r\nbe infected by sucking blood of a yellow-fever patient during\r\nthe first three days of the disease; to prove that the parasite\r\nwas present in the circulating blood at that time we therefore\r\ninjected some of this fluid taken from a different case each\r\ntime, under the skin of five men: four of these suffered an\r\nattack of yellow fever as the result of the injection. The\r\nother one, a Spaniard, could not be infected either by the\r\ninjection of blood or the application of mosquitoes which were\r\nknown to be infected, showing that he had a natural immunity\r\nor, more likely, that he had had yellow fever at some previous\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhile selecting the Spaniards, it was often ascertained that\r\nthey had been in Cuba before, as soldiers in the Spanish army\r\nusually, and the natural conclusion was that they had undergone\r\ninfection; it was very seldom that any escaped during the\r\nSpanish control of the island.\r\n\r\nThus terminated our experiments with mosquitoes which, though\r\nnecessarily performed on human beings, fortunately did not\r\ncause a single death; on the other hand, they served to\r\nrevolutionize all standard methods of sanitation with regard to\r\nyellow fever. They showed the uselessness of disinfection of\r\nclothing and how easily an epidemic can be stamped out in a\r\ncommunity by simply protecting the sick from the sting of the\r\nmosquitoes and by the extensive and wholesale destruction of\r\nthese insects which, added to the suppression of their breeding\r\nplaces, if thoroughly carried out, are the only measures\r\nnecessary to forever rid a country of this scourge.\r\n\r\nBesides keeping a sharp lookout against the importation of\r\nyellow fever cases, these are the simple rules that have kept\r\nthe Panama Canal free and prevented the slaughter of hundreds\r\nof foreigners, so generally expected every year, in former\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nSince we made our demonstration in 1901, our work has been\r\ncorroborated by various commissions appointed for the purpose,\r\nin Mexico, Brazil and Cuba, composed variously of Americans,\r\nFrench, English, Cuban, Brazilian and German investigators.\r\nNothing has been added to our original findings; nothing has\r\nbeen contradicted of what we have reported, and to-day, after\r\nnearly thirteen years, the truths that we uncovered stand\r\nincontrovertible; besides, they have been the means of driving\r\nout yellow fever from Cuba, the United States (Laredo, Texas,\r\n1903 and New Orleans, La., 1905), British Honduras and several\r\ncities of Brazil.\r\n\r\nOf the Army Board only I remain. Lazear, as reported, died\r\nduring the early part of our investigations; Reed left us in\r\n1902 and Carroll only five years later. The reader may wonder\r\nof what benefit was it to us, this painstaking and remarkable\r\naccomplishment which has been such a blessing to humanity! See\r\nwhat the late Surgeon General of the U. S. Army had to say in\r\nhis report (Senate Document No. 520, Sixty-first Congress,\r\nsecond session):\r\n\r\n1. Major Walter Reed, surgeon, United States Army, died in\r\nWashington, D. C., from appendicitis, November 23, 1902, aged\r\n51. His widow, Emilie Lawrence Reed, is receiving a pension of\r\n$125 a month.\r\n\r\n2 Maj. James Carroll was promoted from first lieutenant to\r\nmajor by special act of Congress, March 9, 1907. He died in\r\nWashington, D C., of myocarditis, September 16, 1907. His\r\nwidow, Jennie H. Carroll, since his death, has received an\r\nannuity of $125 a month, appropriated from year to year in the\r\nArmy appropriation bill.\r\n\r\n3. Dr. Jesse W. Lazear, contract surgeon, United States Army,\r\ndied at Camp Columbia, Cuba, of yellow fever, September 25,\r\n1900. His widow, Mabel M. Lazear, since his death, has received\r\nan annuity of $125 a month appropriated from year to year in\r\nthe Army appropriation bill.\r\n\r\n4. Dr. Aristides Agramonte is the only living member of the\r\nboard. He is professor of bacteriology and experimental\r\npathology in the University of Habana and has never received,\r\neither directly or indirectly, any material reward for his\r\nshare in the work of the board.\r\n\r\nIt is not for me to make any comments: the above paragraphs\r\nhave all the force of a plain, truthful statement of facts.\r\nPerhaps it is thought that enough reward is to be found in the\r\ncontemplation of so much good derived from one's own efforts\r\nand the feeling it may produce of innermost satisfaction and in\r\nforming the belief that one had not lived in vain. In a very\r\ngreat measure, I know, the thought is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE STARS AND THE FORMATION OF THE EARTH. IV\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM WALLACE CAMPBELL\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR OF THE LICK OBSERVATORY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETESIMAL HYPOTHESIS\r\n\r\nTHE most elaborate structure yet proposed to explain the origin\r\nof the solar system is the planetesimal hypothesis by\r\nChamberlin and Moulton. The energy which these investigators\r\nhave devoted to formulating and testing this hypothesis, in the\r\nlight of the principles of mechanics, has been commensurate\r\nwith the importance of the subject. They postulate that the\r\nmaterials now composing the Sun, planets, and satellites, at\r\none time existed as a spiral nebula, or as a great spiral swarm\r\nof discrete particles, each particle in elliptic motion about\r\nthe central nucleus. The authors go further back and endeavor\r\nto account for the origin of the spiral nebula, but this phase\r\nof the subject is not vital to their hypothesis. However, it\r\nconduces to clearness in presenting their hypothesis to begin\r\nwith the earlier process.\r\n\r\nIt may happen, once in a while, that two stars will collide. If\r\nthe collision is a grazing one, they say, a spiral nebula will\r\nbe formed. However, a fairly close approach of two stars will\r\noccur in vastly greater frequency and the effect of this\r\napproach will also be to form a spiral nebula or two such\r\nnebulae. The authors recall that our Sun is constantly ejecting\r\nmaterials to a considerable height to form the prominences, and\r\nthat the attractions of a great star passing fairly close to\r\nour solar system would assist this process of expulsion of\r\nmatter from the Sun. A great outbreak or ejection of matter\r\nwould occur not only on the side of our Sun turned toward the\r\ndisturbing body, but on the opposite side as well, for the same\r\nreason that tides in our oceans are raised on the side opposite\r\nthe Moon as well as on the side toward the Moon. As the Sun and\r\ndisturbing star proceeded in their orbits, the stream of matter\r\nleaving our Sun on the side of the disturbing body would try to\r\nfollow the other star; and the stream of matter leaving the\r\nother side of the Sun would shoot out in curves essentially\r\nsymmetrical with those in the first stream. As the disturbing\r\nstar approached and receded the paths taken by the ejected\r\nmatter would be successively along curves such as are\r\nrepresented by the dotted lines in Fig. 28. At any given moment\r\nthe ejected matter would lie on the two heavy lines. The matter\r\nwould not be moving along the heavy lines, but nearly at right\r\nangles to them, in the directions that the lighter curves are\r\npointing. As the ejections would not be continuous, but on the\r\ncontrary intermittent, because of violent pulsations of the\r\nSun's body, there would be irregularities in the two spiral\r\nstreamers. The materials drawn out of the Sun would revolve\r\naround it in elliptic orbits after the disturbing body had\r\npassed beyond the distance of effective disturbance, as\r\nillustrated in Fig. 29. The orbits of the different masses\r\nwould have different sizes and different eccentricities. There\r\nwould also be a wide distribution of finely-divided material\r\nbetween the main branches of the spiral. All of the widespread\r\ngaseous matter, hot when it left the Sun, would soon become\r\ncold, by expansion and radiation; and only the massive nuclei\r\nwould remain gaseous and hot.\r\n\r\nI see no reason to question the efficiency of this ingenious\r\nexplanation of the origin of a spiral nebula: the close passage\r\nof two massive stars could, in my opinion, produce an effect\r\nresembling a spiral nebula, quite in accordance with Moulton's\r\ntest calculations upon the subject. Some of the spirals have\r\npossibly been formed in this way (see Fig. 30); but that the\r\ntens of thousands of spirals known to exist in the sky have\r\nactually been produced in this manner is another question, and\r\none which, in my opinion, is open to grave doubt. But to this\r\npoint we shall return later.\r\n\r\nThere are marked advantages in starting the evolution of the\r\nsolar system from a spiral nebula, aside from the fact that\r\nspirals are abundant, and therefore represent a standard\r\nproduct of development. The material is thinly and very\r\nirregularly distributed in a plane passing through the Sun, and\r\nthe motions around the Sun are all in the same direction. The\r\ngreat difficulty in the Laplace hypothesis, as to the constancy\r\nof the moment of momentum, is here eliminated. There are\r\nwell-defined condensations of nuclei at quite different\r\ndistances from the Sun. According to this hypothesis the\r\nprincipal nuclei are the beginnings of the future planets. They\r\ndraw into themselves the materials with which they come in\r\ncontact by virtue of the crossings of the orbits of various\r\nsizes and various eccentricities. The growth of the planets is\r\ngradual, for the sweeping up and combining process must be\r\nexcessively slow. The satellites are started from those smaller\r\nnuclei which happen to be moving with just the right speeds not\r\nto escape entirely the attractions of the principal nuclei, nor\r\nto fall into them. The planes of the planetary orbits and, in\r\ngeneral, the planes of the satellite orbits should agree quite\r\nclosely with each other, but they could differ and should\r\ndiffer from that of the Sun's equator.\r\n\r\nThe authors call attention to the fact that the Sun's equator\r\nis inclined at a small angle, 7 degrees, to the common planes\r\nof the planetary system, and Chamberlin holds this to be one of\r\nthe strong points in favor of the planetesimal hypothesis. He\r\nreasons thus: the star which passed close to our Sun and drew\r\nout the planetary materials in the form of spiral streams must\r\nhave moved in the plane of the spiral; that is, in the plane of\r\nour planetary system. Some of the materials would be drawn out\r\nfrom our Sun only a very short distance and then fall back upon\r\nthe Sun. Great tidal waves would be formed on opposite sides of\r\nthe Sun, and these would try to follow the disturbing body. The\r\neffect of these waves and of the materials which fall back\r\nwould be to change the Sun's original rotation plane in the\r\ndirection of the disturbing body's orbital plane.\r\n\r\nNow the chance for a disturbing star's passing around our Sun\r\nin a plane making a large angle, say from 45 degrees to 90\r\ndegrees, with the Sun's equator, is much greater than for a\r\nsmall angle 0 degrees to 45 degrees. The chances are greatest\r\nthat the angle will be 90 degrees. Only those disturbing stars\r\nwhich approach our Sun PRECISELY in the plane of the Sun's\r\nequator could move around the Sun in this plane. All those\r\napproaching along any line parallel to the Sun's equatorial\r\nplane, but lying outside of this plane, and all those whose\r\ndirections of approach make any angle whatever with the\r\nequatorial plane, would find it impossible to move in that\r\nplane. That the angle under this hypothesis is only 7 degrees\r\nis surprising, though, as we are dealing with but a single\r\ncase, we can not say, I think, that this militates either for\r\nor against the hypothesis. We are entitled to say only that\r\nunless the approach was so close as to cause disturbances in\r\nour Sun to relatively great depths, the angle referred to would\r\nhave only one chance in ten or fifteen or twenty to be as small\r\nas 7 degrees. Any disturbance which succeeded in taking out of\r\nthe Sun only 1/7 of 1 per cent. of its mass could scarcely\r\nsucceed in shifting the axis of rotation of the remaining 99\r\n6/7 per cent. very much, I think. If the angle were 30 degrees\r\nor 50 degrees or 80 degrees, instead of 7 degrees, the case for\r\nthe planetesimal hypothesis would be somewhat stronger.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact concerning the Sun is that the equatorial\r\nregion rotates once around in a shorter time than the regions\r\nin higher latitudes require. The rotation period of the Sun's\r\nequator is about 24 days; the period at latitude 45 degrees is\r\n28 days; and at 75 degrees, 33 days. The planetesimal\r\nhypothesis attributes this equatorial acceleration to the\r\nfalling back into the Sun of the materials which had been\r\nlifted out to a short distance by the disturbing body, and to\r\nthe forward-rushing tide raised in the equatorial regions by\r\nthe disturbing body. This may well have occurred. However, we\r\nmust remember that the same phenomenon exists certainly in\r\nJupiter and Saturn, and quite probably in Uranus and Neptune;\r\nthat is, in all the bodies in the system that are gaseous and\r\nfree to show the effect. It seems to be the result of a\r\nprinciple which has operated throughout the solar system, not\r\nrequiring, at least not directly requiring, the passage of a\r\ndisturbing star. I think the most plausible explanation of this\r\ncurious phenomenon is that great quantities of materials\r\noriginally revolving around the Sun and around each of the\r\nplanets have gradually been drawn into these bodies, by\r\npreference into their equatorial areas. Such masses of matter\r\nmoving in orbits very close to these bodies must have traveled\r\nwith speeds vastly higher than the surface speeds of the\r\nbodies. To illustrate, the rotational velocity of a particle\r\nnow in the Sun's surface at the equator is approximately 2 km.\r\nper second. A small body revolving around the Sun close to his\r\nsurface, rapidly enough to prevent its falling quickly upon the\r\nSun, must have a velocity of more than 400 km. per second. If,\r\nnow, this small body encounters some resistance it will fall\r\ninto the Sun, and as it is traveling more than 200 times as\r\nrapidly as the solar materials into which it drops, it will\r\nboth generate heat and accelerate the rotational velocity of\r\nthe surrounding materials. In the same way the equatorial\r\naccelerations in Jupiter and Saturn can receive simple\r\nexplanation. The point is not necessarily in opposition to the\r\nplanetesimal hypothesis; but whatever the explanation, it ought\r\nto apply to the planet as well as to the Sun.\r\n\r\nIf the spiral nebulae have been formed in accordance with\r\nChamberlin and Moulton's hypothesis, the secondary nuclei in\r\nthem must revolve in a great variety of elliptic orbits. The\r\norbits would intersect, and in the course of long ages the\r\nseparate masses would collide and combine and the number of\r\nseparate masses would constantly grow smaller. Moulton has\r\nshown that IN GENERAL the combining of two masses whose orbits\r\nintersect causes the combined mass to move in an orbit more\r\nnearly circular than the average orbit of the separate masses,\r\nand in general in orbit planes more nearly coincident with the\r\ngeneral plane of the system. Accordingly, the major planets\r\nshould move in orbits more nearly circular and more nearly in\r\nthe plane of the system than do the asteroids; and so they do.\r\nIf the asteroids should combine to form one planet the orbit of\r\nthis planet should be much less eccentric than the average of\r\nall the present asteroid eccentricities, and the deviation of\r\nits orbit plane should be less than the average deviation of\r\nthe present planes. We can not doubt that this would be the\r\ncase. Mercury and Mars, the smallest planets, should have,\r\naccording to this principle, the largest eccentricities and\r\norbital inclinations of any of the major planets. This is true\r\nof the eccentricities, but Mars's orbit plane, contrarily, has\r\na small inclination. Venus and the Earth, next in size, should\r\nhave the next largest inclinations and eccentricities, but they\r\ndo not; Venus's eccentricity is the smallest of all. The\r\nEarth's orbital inclination and eccentricity are both small.\r\nJupiter and Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, should have the\r\nsmallest orbital inclinations; their average inclination is\r\nabout the same as for Venus and the Earth. They should likewise\r\nhave the smallest eccentricities. Neptune, the smallest of the\r\nfour, has an orbit nearly circular; Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus\r\nhave eccentricities more than 4 times those of Venus and the\r\nEarth. Considering the four large planets as one group and the\r\nfour small planets as another group, we find that the\r\ninclinations of the orbits of the two groups, per unit mass,\r\nare about equal; but the average eccentricity of the orbits of\r\nthe large planets, per unit mass, is 21 times that of the\r\norbits of the small planets.[1] The evidence, except as to the\r\nasteroids and Mercury, is not favorable to the planetesimal\r\nhypothesis, unless we make special assumptions as to the\r\ndistribution of materials in the spiral nebulae.\r\n\r\n[2] The average eccentricity of the orbits of the four inner\r\nplanets (per unit mass) is 0.0221, and of the four outer\r\nplanets is 0.0489.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that the disturbing body drew 225 times as much matter\r\na great distance to form the four large planets as it drew out\r\na short distance to form the four small planets and the\r\nasteroids seems difficult of explanation on the planetesimal\r\nhypothesis. However, this distribution of matter is at present\r\na difficulty in any of the hypotheses. The planetesimal\r\nhypothesis explains well all west to east rotations of the\r\nplanets on their axes, but to make Uranus rotate nearly at\r\nright angles to the plane of the system, and Neptune in a plane\r\ninclined 135 degrees to the plane of the system, is a\r\ndifficulty in any of the hypotheses, unless special assumptions\r\nare made to fit each case.\r\n\r\nThe authors succeed well, I think, in showing that the\r\nsatellites should prefer to revolve around their planets in the\r\ndirection of the planetary revolution and rotation, especially\r\nfor close satellites, and, on the basis of special assumptions,\r\nin the reverse direction for satellites at a greater distance.\r\nThey show that the chances favor small eccentricities for\r\nsatellites revolving about their planets in the west to east,\r\nor direct sense, and large eccentricities for satellites moving\r\nin retrograde directions. The inner satellite of Mars and the\r\nrings of Saturn make no special difficulty under the\r\nplanetesimal hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the comets, as bona fide members of the solar\r\nsystem which approach the Sun almost, and perhaps quite,\r\nindifferently from all directions, is that the volume of space\r\noccupied by the parent structure of the system was of enormous\r\ndimensions, both at right angles to the present principal plane\r\nof the system and in that plane. We are accustomed to think of\r\nthe spiral nebulae as thin relatively to their major diameters.\r\nTo this extent the planetesimal hypothesis does not furnish a\r\ngood explanation of the origin of comets, unless we assume that\r\na small amount of matter was widely scattered in all directions\r\naround the parent spiral; and this conception leads to some\r\napparent difficulties. The origin of the comets is difficult to\r\nexplain under any of the hypotheses.\r\n\r\nRESUME OF HYPOTHESES\r\n\r\nKant's hypothesis had the great defect of trying to prove too\r\nmuch. It started from matter AT REST, and came to grief in\r\ntrying to give a motion of rotation to the entire mass through\r\nthe operation of internal forces alone--an impossibility.\r\nKant's idea of nuclei or centers of gravitational attraction,\r\nscattered here and there throughout the chaotic mass, which\r\ngrew into the planets and their satellites, is very valuable.\r\n\r\nLaplace's hypothesis had the great advantage of starting with\r\nan extended mass already in rotation, but it violated fatally\r\nthe law of constancy of moment of momentum. We should expect\r\nthis hypothesis to create a solar system free from\r\nirregularities, very much as if it were the product of an\r\ninstrument-maker's precision lathe. The solar system as it\r\nexists is a combination of regularities and many surprising\r\nirregularities.\r\n\r\nChamberlin and Moulton's hypothesis has the advantage of a\r\nparent mass in rotation, practically in a common plane, and\r\nwith the materials distributed at distances from the nucleus as\r\nnearly in harmony with the known distribution of matter in the\r\nsolar system as we care to have them, except perhaps as to the\r\ncomets. In effect it retains all the advantageous qualities of\r\nKant's proposals. It seems to have the flexibility required in\r\nmeeting the irregularities that we see in our system.\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF SPIRAL NEBULAE\r\n\r\nI think it is very doubtful whether the spiral nebulae have in\r\ngeneral been formed by the close approaches of pairs of stars,\r\nas the authors have postulated for the assumed solar spiral.[2]\r\nThe distribution of the spirals seems to me to negative the\r\nidea. To witness the close approach of two stars we must look\r\nin the direction where the stars are. To the best of\r\npresent-day knowledge the stars are in a spheroid whose longer\r\naxes are coincident with the plane of the Milky Way. If this is\r\nso, the close approach of pairs of stars should occur\r\npreeminently in the Milky Way, and we should find the spirals\r\nprevailingly in and near the Milky Way. This is precisely where\r\nwe do not find them. In fact, they seem to abhor the Milky Way.\r\nThe new stars, which are credibly explained as the products of\r\ncollisions of stars with nebulae, are found preeminently in the\r\nMilky Way and almost negligibly in the regions outside of the\r\nMilky Way. Again, the spirals are believed to be, on the whole,\r\nof enormous size. They are too far away to let us measure their\r\ndistances by the usual methods, and they move too slowly on the\r\nsurface of the sphere to have let us determine their proper\r\nmotions. Slipher's recent work with a spectrograph seems to\r\nshow that the dozen spirals observed by him are moving with\r\nhigh speeds of approach and recession; from 300 km. per second\r\napproach in the case of the Andromeda nebula to 1,100 km. per\r\nsecond recession in the case of several objects. If the spirals\r\nare moving at random their speeds at right angles to the line\r\nof sight must be even greater than their speeds of approach and\r\nrecession. Unless they are very distant bodies their proper\r\nmotions should be detected by observations extending over only\r\na few years. My colleague Curtis has this year compared recent\r\nphotographs of some 25 spirals with photographs of the same\r\nobject made by Keeler fifteen years ago. They reveal no\r\nappreciable proper motions, or rotations. In this same interval\r\nNeptune has revolved more than 30 degrees. Slipher has recently\r\nmeasured the rotational speed of one \"spindle\" nebula, believed\r\nto be a spiral. He finds it to be enormously rapid; no motions\r\nin the solar system approach it in magnitude. The evidence is\r\nto the effect that the spirals are in general very far away;[3]\r\nperhaps on or beyond the confines of our stellar system, but\r\nnot certainly so. Accordingly, we are led to believe that the\r\nspirals studied thus far have diameters 20 times or 100 times,\r\nor in some cases several thousand times, the diameter of our\r\nsolar system. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in\r\ngeneral they are immensely more massive than is our solar\r\nsystem. The spiral which has been assumed as the forerunner of\r\nour system must have been of diminutive size as compared with\r\nthe larger and brighter spirals which we see to-day.\r\n\r\n[2] It would seem that all rotating nebulae should in reality\r\npossess some of the attributes of spiral motion. Whether the\r\nspiral structure should be visible or invisible to a\r\nterrestrial observer would depend upon the sizes and distances\r\nof the nebulae, upon the distribution of materials composing\r\nthem, and perhaps upon other factors. See developed the\r\nhypothesis that spiral nebulae owe their origin to the\r\ncollision of two nebulae. Collisions of this kind could readily\r\noccur because of the enormous dimensions of the nebulae, and\r\nmotions of rotation and consequently spiral structure might\r\nreadily result therefrom. The abnormally high speeds of the\r\nspiral nebulae are apparently a very strong objection to the\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n[3] Bohlin found a parallax of 0\"17 for the Andromeda Nebula,\r\nand Lampland thinks that Nebula N.G.G. 4594 has a proper motion\r\nof approximately 0\"05 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are sadly in need of information concerning the constitution\r\nof the spiral nebulae. Their spectra appear to be prevailingly\r\nof the solar type, except that a very small proportion contain\r\nsome bright lines in addition to the continuous spectrum. So\r\nfar as their spectra are concerned, they may be great clusters\r\nof stars, or they may consist each of a central star sending\r\nits light out upon surrounding dark materials and thus\r\nrendering these materials visible to us. The first alternative\r\nis unsatisfactory, for all parts of spirals have hazy borders,\r\nas if the structure is nebulous or consists of irregular groups\r\nof small masses; and the second alternative is unsatisfactory,\r\nfor in many spirals the most outlying masses seem to be as\r\nbright as masses of the same areas situated only one half as\r\nfar from the center, whereas in general the inner area should\r\nbe at least four times as bright as the outer area. All\r\nastronomers are ready to confess that we do not know much about\r\nthe conditions existing in spiral nebulae.\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM\r\n\r\nOur Earth and Moon form a unique combination in that they are\r\nmore nearly of the same size than are any other planet and its\r\nsatellites in our system. It required a 26-inch telescope on\r\nthe Earth to discover the tiny moons of Mars; but an astronomer\r\non Mars does not need any telescope to see the Earth and Moon\r\nas a double planet--the only double planet in the solar system.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Kantian school of hypotheses the Earth and\r\nMoon owe their unique character to the accident that two\r\ncenters of condensation--two nuclei--not very unequal in mass,\r\nwere formed close to each other and were endowed with or\r\nacquired motions such that they revolved around each other.\r\nThey drew in the surrounding materials; one of the two bodies\r\ngot somewhat the advantage of the other in gravitational\r\nattraction; it succeeded in building itself up more than the\r\nother nucleus did; and the Earth and the Moon were the result.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Laplacean hypothesis, on the contrary, the\r\nEarth and Moon were originally one body, gaseous and in\r\nrotation. This ball of gas radiated heat, diminished in size,\r\nrotated more and more rapidly, and finally abandoned a ring of\r\nnebulosity, which later broke up and eventually condensed into\r\none mass called the Moon. The central mass composed the Earth.\r\nIt is a curious fact that Venus, which is only a shade smaller\r\nthan the Earth, should not have divided into two bodies\r\ncomparable with the Earth and Moon. Have the tides on Venus\r\nproduced by the Sun always been strong enough to keep the\r\nrotation and revolution periods equal, as they are thought to\r\nbe now, and thus to have given no opportunity for a rapidly\r\nrotating Venus to divide into two masses?\r\n\r\nA third hypothesis of the Moon's origin is due principally to\r\nDarwin. He and Poincare have shown that a great rotating mass\r\nof fluid matter, such as the Earth-Moon could be assumed to\r\nhave been, by cooling, contracting and increasing rotation\r\nspeed, would, under certain conditions thought to be\r\nreasonable, become unstable and eventually divide into two\r\nbodies revolving around their common center of mass, at first\r\nwith their surfaces nearly in contact. Here would begin to act\r\na tide-raising force which must have played, according to\r\nDarwin's deductions, a most important part in the further\r\nhistory of the Earth and Moon. The Earth would produce enormous\r\ntides in the Moon, and the Moon much smaller tides in the\r\nEarth. Both bodies would contract in size, through loss of\r\nheat, and would try to rotate more and more rapidly. The two\r\nrotating bodies would try to carry the matter in the tidal\r\nwaves around with the rest of the materials in the bodies, but\r\nthe pull of each body upon the wave materials in the other\r\nwould tend to slow down the speed of rotation. The tidal\r\nresistance to rotation would be slight if the bodies at any\r\ntime were attenuated gaseous masses, for the friction within\r\nthe surface strata would be slight. Nevertheless, there would\r\neventually be a gradual slowing down of the Moon's rotation, a\r\ngradual slowing down of the Earth's rotation, and a slow\r\nincrease in the distance between the two bodies. In other\r\nwords, the Moon's day, the Earth's day and our month would\r\ngradually increase in length. Carried to its logical\r\nconclusion, the Moon would eventually turn the same face to the\r\nEarth, the Earth would eventually turn the same face to the\r\nMoon, and the Earth's day and the Moon's day would equal the\r\nmonth in length. The central idea in this logic is as old as\r\nKant: in 1754 he published an important paper in which he said\r\nthat tidal interactions between Earth and Moon had caused the\r\nMoon to keep the same face turned toward us, that the Earth's\r\nday was being very slowly lengthened, and that our planet would\r\neventually turn the same face to the Moon. Laplace, a\r\nhalf-century later, proposed the action of such a force in\r\nconnection with the explanation of lunar phenomena, and\r\nHelmholtz, just 100 years after Kant's paper was published,\r\nlent his support to this principle; but Sir George Darwin has\r\nbeen the great contributor to the subject. His popular volume,\r\n\"The Tides,\" devotes several chapters to the effects of tidal\r\nfriction upon the motions of two bodies in mutual revolution.\r\nWe must pass over the difficult and complicated intermediate\r\nsteps to Darwin's conclusions concerning the Earth and Moon,\r\nwhich are substantially as follows: the Earth and Moon were\r\noriginally much closer together than they now are: after a very\r\nlong period of time, amounting to hundreds of millions of\r\nyears, the Moon will revolve around the Earth in 55 days\r\ninstead of in 27 days as at present; and the Moon and Earth\r\nwill then present the same faces constantly to each other. The\r\nestimated period of time required, and the final length of day\r\nand month, 55 days, are of course not insisted upon as accurate\r\nby Darwin.\r\n\r\nThese tidal forces were unavoidably active, it matters not if\r\nthe Earth and Moon were originally one body, as Laplace and\r\nDarwin have postulated, or originally two bodies, growing up\r\nfrom two nuclei, in accordance with the Kantian school. Whether\r\nthese forces have been sufficiently strong to have brought the\r\nEarth and Moon to their present relation, or will eventually\r\nequalize the Moon's day, the Earth's day, and the month, is a\r\nvastly more difficult question. Moulton's researches have cast\r\nserious doubt upon this conclusion. All such investigations are\r\nenormously difficult, and many questionable assumptions must be\r\nmade if we seek to go back to the Moon's origin, or forward to\r\nits ultimate destiny.\r\n\r\nTidal waves, in order to be effective in reducing the\r\nrotational speed of a planet, must be accompanied by internal\r\nfriction; and this requires that the planet be to some extent\r\ninelastic. It was the view of Darwin and others that the\r\nviscous state of the Earth and Moon permitted wave friction to\r\ncome into play. Michelson has recently proved that the Earth\r\nhas a high degree of elasticity. It deforms in response to\r\ntidal forces, but quickly recovers from the action of these\r\nforces. It therefore seems that the rate of tidal evolution of\r\nthe Earth-Moon system at present and in the future must be\r\nextremely slow, and possibly almost negligible. What the\r\nconditions within the Earth and Moon were in the distant past\r\nis uncertain, but these bodies probably passed through viscous\r\nstages which endured through enormously long periods of time.\r\nNo one seriously doubts that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and\r\nNeptune are now largely gaseous, and that they will evolve,\r\nthrough various degrees of viscosity, into the solid and\r\ncomparatively elastic state. It is natural to assume that the\r\nEarth has already passed through an analogous experience.\r\n\r\nThe Moon turns always the same hemisphere toward the Earth.\r\nObservations of Venus and Mercury are prevailingly to the\r\neffect that those planets always turn the same hemispheres\r\ntoward the Sun. Many, and perhaps all, of the satellites of\r\nJupiter and Saturn seem to turn the same hemispheres always\r\ntoward their respective planets. This widely prevailing\r\nphenomenon is no doubt due to a widely prevailing cause, which\r\nastronomers have all but unanimously attributed to tidal\r\naction.\r\n\r\nBINARY STAR SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nThat an original mass actually divided to form the Earth and\r\nMoon, according to the Laplacian or the Darwin-Poincare\r\nprinciple, seems to be extremely doubtful, especially on\r\naccount of their diminutive sizes, and I greatly prefer to\r\nthink that the Earth and Moon were built up from two nuclei;\r\nbut that very much greater masses, masses larger on the average\r\nthan our Sun, composing highly attenuated stars, have divided\r\neach into two masses to form many or most of our double stars,\r\nI firmly believe. The two component stars would in such a case\r\nat first revolve around each other with their surfaces almost\r\nor quite in contact. Tidal forces would very gradually cause\r\nthe bodies to move in orbits of larger and larger size, with\r\ncorrespondingly longer periods of revolutions, and the orbits\r\nwould become constantly more eccentric. While these processes\r\nwere under way the component bodies would be radiating heat and\r\ngrowing smaller, and their spectra would be changing into the\r\nmore advanced types. We can not hope to watch such changes as\r\nthey occur, but we can, I think, find abundant illustrations of\r\nthese processes in the double stars. I have given reasons for\r\nbelieving that one star in every two and one half, as a minimum\r\nproportion, is not the single star which it appears to be to\r\nthe eye or in the telescope, but is a system of two or more\r\nsuns in mutual revolution. The formation of double stars,\r\ntherefore, is not a sporadic process: it is one of the\r\nstraightforward results of the evolutionary process.\r\n\r\nSome of the variable stars offer strong evidence as to the\r\nearly life of the double stars. The so-called beta Lyrae\r\nvariables vary continuously in brightness, as if they consist\r\nin each case of two stars so close together that their surfaces\r\nare actually in contact in some pairs and nearly in contact in\r\nothers, so that from our point of view the two stars mutually\r\neclipse each other. When the two stars are in line with us we\r\nhave minimum brightness. When they have moved a\r\nquarter-revolution farther, and the line joining them is at\r\nright angles to our line of sight, so to speak, we have maximum\r\nbrightness. In every known case the beta Lyrae pairs of stars\r\nhave spectra of the very early types. Some of them even contain\r\nbright lines in their spectra. The densities of these great\r\nstars are known to be exceedingly low, in some cases much lower\r\non the average than that of the atmosphere which we breathe.\r\n\r\nAbout 80 Algol variable stars are known. These are double stars\r\nwhose light is constant except during the short time when one\r\nof the components in each system passes between us and the\r\nother component. All double stars would be Algol variables if\r\nwe were exactly in the planes of their orbits. That so few\r\nAlgols have been observed amongst the tens of thousands of\r\ndouble stars, is easily explained. The two component stars in\r\nthe few known Algol systems are so great in diameter, in\r\nproportion to the size of their orbits, that eclipses are\r\nobservable throughout a wide volume of space, and the eclipses\r\nare of long duration relatively to the revolution period. Their\r\ndensities are, so far as we have been able to determine them,\r\non an average less than 1/10th of the Sun's density. Let us\r\nnote well that their spectra, so far as we have been able to\r\ndetermine them, are of the early types; mostly helium and\r\nhydrogen stars, and a very few of the Class F, intermediate\r\nbetween the hydrogen and solar stars. There are no known Algols\r\nof the Classes G, K, and M: these stars are very condensed and\r\ntherefore small in size, as compared with stars of Classes B\r\nand A; and the components of double stars of these classes are\r\non the average much denser and therefore smaller in size than\r\nthe components in Classes B and A double stars; the components\r\nare much farther apart in Classes G to M doubles than in\r\nClasses B and A doubles; and for these reasons eclipses in\r\nClasses G to M doubles occur but rarely for observers scattered\r\nthroughout space. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that\r\nthe components of double stars separate more and more widely\r\nwith the progress of time. The conclusions which we have\r\nearlier drawn from visual double stars are in full harmony with\r\nthe argument.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed by all, I think, that tidal action has been\r\nresponsible for at least a part of the separation of the Earth\r\nand Moon, for at least a part of the gradual separation of the\r\ncomponents of double stars, and for at least a part of the\r\neccentricity of their orbits. See's investigations of 25 years\r\nago led him to the conclusion that this force is sufficient to\r\naccount for all the observed separation of the components of\r\ndouble stars, and for the well-known high eccentricities of\r\ntheir orbits. In recent years Moulton and Russell have\r\nseriously questioned the sufficiency of this force to account\r\nfor the major part of the separation and eccentricity in the\r\ndouble star systems. I think, however, that if the tidal force\r\nis not competent to account for the observed facts as\r\ndescribed, some other separating force or forces must be found\r\nto supply the deficiency.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\nDoes the condition of the Earth's interior give evidence on the\r\nquestion of its origin? There are certain important facts which\r\nbear upon the problem.\r\n\r\n1. The evidence supplied by the volcanoes, by the hot springs,\r\nand by the rise in temperature as we go down in all deep mines,\r\nis unmistakably to the effect that there is an immense quantity\r\nof heat in the Earth's interior. Near the surface the\r\ntemperature increases at the average of 1 degrees Centigrade\r\nfor every 30 meters of depth. If this rate were maintained we\r\nshould at 60 km. in depth arrive at a temperature high enough\r\nto melt platinum, the most refractory of the known metals. What\r\nthe law of temperature-increase at great depths is we do not\r\nknow, but the temperature of the Earth's deep interior must be\r\nvery high.\r\n\r\n2. The pressures in the Earth increase from zero at the surface\r\nto the order of 3,000,000 atmospheric pressures at the center.\r\nWe know that rock structure, or iron or other metals, can be\r\nslightly compressed by pressure, but the experiments at very\r\nhigh pressures, notably those conducted by Bridgman, give no\r\nindications that matter under such pressures breaks down and\r\nobeys different or unknown laws. It should be said, however,\r\nthat laboratory pressure-effects alone are not a safe guide as\r\nto conditions within the Earth, where high pressures are\r\naccompanied by high temperature. Unfortunately it has not been\r\nfound possible to combine the high-temperature factor with the\r\nhigh-pressure factor in the laboratory experiments. It is well\r\nknown that the melting points of metals, including rocks,\r\nincrease with increase of pressure; and although the\r\ntemperatures in the Earth's interior are very high, it is easy\r\nto conceive that the materials of the Earth's interior are\r\nnevertheless in the solid state, or that they act like solids,\r\nbecause of the high pressures to which they are subjected.\r\n\r\n3. The specific gravity of the entire Earth is 5.5 on the scale\r\nof water as one, whereas the density of the stratified rocks\r\naverages only 2.75; that is, the stratified rocks have but one\r\nhalf the density of the Earth as a whole. The basaltic rocks\r\nunderlying the stratified attain occasionally the density 3.1,\r\nand perhaps a little higher. It follows absolutely that the\r\ndensity of the materials of the Earth's interior must be\r\nconsiderably in excess of 5.5. If the interior is composed\r\nchiefly of substances which are plentiful in the Earth's\r\nsurface strata, our choice of materials which principally\r\ncompose the interior is reduced to a few elements, notably the\r\ndenser ones.\r\n\r\n4. The observed phenomena of terrestrial precession can not be\r\nexplained on the basis of an Earth with a thin solid surface\r\nshell and a liquid interior, for the attractions of the Moon\r\nand Sun upon the Earth's equatorial protuberance would cause\r\nthe surface shell to shift over the fluid interior, instead of\r\nswinging the entire Earth.\r\n\r\n5. If the Earth consisted of a thin solid shell upon a liquid\r\ninterior there would be tides in the liquid interior, the crust\r\nwould yield to these tides almost as if it were composed of\r\nrubber, and the ocean tides would be only an insignificant\r\namount larger than the land tides. As a result we should not\r\nsee the ocean tides; their visibility depends upon the contrast\r\nbetween the ocean tides and the land tides. If the Earth were\r\nabsolutely unyielding from surface to center the ocean tides\r\nwould be relatively 50 per cent. higher than we now see them.\r\nThe conclusion from these facts is that the Earth yields to the\r\ntidal forces a little less than if it were a solid ball of\r\nsteel, supposing that the well-known rigidity and density\r\nexisted from surface to center of the ball. This result is\r\nestablished by Darwin's and Schweydar's studies of ocean tides,\r\nby studies of the tides in the Earth's surface strata made by\r\nHecker, Paschwitz and others, and by Michelson's recent\r\nextremely accurate comparison of land and water tides.\r\nMichelson's results establish further that the Earth is highly\r\nelastic: though distortion is resisted, there is yielding, but\r\nthe original form is recovered quickly, almost as quickly as a\r\nperfectly elastic body would recover.\r\n\r\n6. Some 25 years ago it was discovered by Kustner that the\r\nlatitudes of points on the Earth's surface are changing slowly.\r\nChandler proved that these variations pass through their\r\nprincipal cycle in a period of 427 days. The entire Earth\r\noscillates slightly in this period. The earlier researches of\r\nEuler had shown that the Earth would have a natural oscillation\r\nperiod of 305 days provided it were an absolutely rigid body.\r\nNewcomb showed that the period of oscillation would be 441 days\r\nif the Earth had the rigidity of steel. As the observed\r\noscillation requires 427 days, Newcomb concluded that the Earth\r\nis slightly more rigid than steel.\r\n\r\n7. The first waves from a very distant earthquake come to us\r\ndirectly through the Earth. The observed speeds of transmission\r\nare the greater, in general, the more nearly the earthquake\r\norigin is exactly on the opposite side of the Earth from the\r\nobserver; that is, the speeds of transmission are greater the\r\nnearer the center of the Earth the waves pass. Now, we know\r\nthat the speeds are functions of the rigidity and density of\r\nthe materials traversed. The observed speeds require for their\r\nexplanation, so far as we can now see, that the rigidity of the\r\nEarth's central volume be much greater than that of steel, and\r\nthe rigidity of the Earth's outer strata considerably less than\r\nthat of steel. Wiechert has shown that a core of radius 4,900\r\nkm. whose rigidity is somewhat greater than that of steel and\r\nwhose average density is 8.3, overlaid by an outer stony shell\r\nof thickness 1,500 km. and average density 3.2, would satisfy\r\nthe observed facts as to the average density of the Earth, as\r\nto the speeds of earthquake waves, as to the flattening of the\r\nEarth,--assuming the concentric strata to be homogeneous in\r\nthemselves,--and as to the relative strengths of gravity at the\r\nPoles and at the Equator. The dividing line, 1,500 km. below\r\nthe surface--1,600 km. would be just one fourth of the way from\r\nthe surface to the center--places a little over half the volume\r\nin the outer shell and a little less than half in the core.\r\nWiechert did not mean that there must be a sudden change of\r\ndensity at the depth of 1,500 km., with uniform density 8.3\r\nbelow that surface and uniform density 3.2 above that surface.\r\nThe change of density is probably fairly continuous. It was\r\nnecessary in such a preliminary investigation to simplify the\r\nassumptions. The observational data are not yet sufficiently\r\naccurate to let us say what the law of increase in density and\r\nrigidity is as we pass from the surface to the center.\r\n\r\n8. The phenomena of terrestrial magnetism indicate that the\r\ndistribution of magnetic materials in the Earth is far from\r\nuniform or symmetrical; the magnetic poles are distant from the\r\nEarth's poles of rotation; the magnetic poles are not opposite\r\neach other; the lines of equal intensity as to all the magnetic\r\ncomponents involved run very irregularly over the Earth's\r\nsurface. There is reason to believe that iron in the deep\r\ninterior of the Earth, in view of its high temperature, is\r\ndevoid of magnetic properties, but we must not state this as a\r\nfact. We know that iron is very widely, but very irregularly\r\nspread throughout the Earth's outer strata. Whatever may be the\r\nmain factors in making the Earth a great magnet, to whatever\r\nextent the rotation factor may be important, the Earth's\r\nmagnetic properties point strongly to a very irregular\r\ndistribution of magnetic materials in the outer strata where\r\nthe temperatures are below that at which magnetic materials\r\ncommonly lose their polarity.\r\n\r\n9. Irregularities in the direction of the plumb-line and in the\r\nforce of gravity as observed widely and accurately over the\r\nEarth's surface indicate that the surface strata are very\r\nirregular as to density. To harmonize the observed facts\r\nHayford has shown the need of assuming that the heterogeneous\r\nconditions extend down to a depth of 122 km. from the surface.\r\nBelow that level the Earth's concentric strata seem to be of\r\napproximately uniform densities.\r\n\r\n10. The radio active elements have been found by Strutt and\r\nothers in practically all kinds of rock accessible to the\r\ngeologists, but they are not found in significant quantities in\r\nthe so-called metals which exist in a pure state. These\r\nradioactive elements are liberating heat. Strutt has shown that\r\nif they existed down to the Earth's center in the same\r\nproportion that he finds in the surface strata they would\r\nliberate a great deal more heat than the body of the Earth is\r\nnow radiating to outer space. The conclusion is that they are\r\nrestricted to the strata relatively near the Earth's surface,\r\nand are not in combination with the materials composing the\r\nEarth's core. They have apparently found some way of coming to\r\nthe higher levels. Chamberlin suggests that as they liberate\r\nheat they would raise surrounding materials to temperatures\r\nabove the normals for their strata, and that these expanded\r\nmaterials would embrace every opportunity to approach the\r\nsurface of the Earth, carrying the radioactive substances with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is exceedingly strong, and perhaps irresistible,\r\nto the effect that the Earth is now solid, or acts like a\r\nsolid, from surface to center, with possibly local, but on the\r\nwhole negligible, pockets of molten matter here and there; and\r\nfurther, that the Earth existed in a molten, or at the least a\r\nthickly plastic, state throughout a long part of its life. The\r\nnucleus, whether gaseous or meteoric, from which I believe it\r\nhas grown, may have been fairly hot or quite cold, and the\r\nmaterials which were successively drawn into the nucleus may\r\nhave been hot or cold: heat would be generated by the impacts\r\nof the incoming materials; and as the attraction toward the\r\ncenter of the mass became strong, additional heat would be\r\ngenerated in the contraction process. The denser materials have\r\nbeen able, on the whole, to gravitate to the center of the\r\nstructure, and the lighter elements have been able, on the\r\nwhole, to rise to and float upon the surface very much as the\r\nlighter impurities in an iron furnace find their way to the\r\nsurface and form the slag upon the molten metal. The lighter\r\nmaterials which in general form the surface strata are solid\r\nunder the conditions of solids known to us in every-day life.\r\nThe interior is solid or at least acts as a solid, because the\r\nmaterials, though at high temperatures, are under stupendous\r\npressures. If the pressures were removed the deep-lying\r\nmaterials would quickly liquefy, and probably even vaporize.\r\n\r\nIf the Earth grew from a small nucleus to its present size by\r\nthe extremely gradual drawing-in of innumerable small masses in\r\nits neighborhood, the process would always be slow; much slower\r\nat first when the small nucleus had low gravitating powers,\r\nmore rapid when the body was of good size and the store of\r\nmaterials to draw upon plentiful,and gradually slower and\r\nslower as the supply of building materials was depleted.\r\nMeteoric matter still falls upon and builds up the Earth, but\r\nat so slow a rate as to increase the Earth's diameter an inch\r\nonly after the passage of hundreds of millions of years. If the\r\nEarth grew in this manner, the growth may now be said to be\r\nessentially complete, through the substantial exhaustion of the\r\nsupply of materials.\r\n\r\nWhether the Earth of its present size was ever completely\r\nliquefied, that is, from center to surface, at one and the same\r\ntime, is doubtful. The lack of homogeneity, as indicated by the\r\nplumb-line, gravity, terrestrial magnetism and radiaoctive\r\nmatter, extending in a perceptible degree down to 122 km., and\r\nquite probably in lesser and imperceptible degree to a much\r\ngreater depth, is opposed to the idea.\r\n\r\nSolidification would respond to the fall of temperature down to\r\nthe point required under the existing high pressures, and it is\r\nprobable that the solidification began at the center and\r\nproceeded outwards. It is natural that the plastic state should\r\nhave developed and existed especially during the age of most\r\nrapid growth, for this would be the age of most rapid\r\ngeneration of heat. Later, while the rate of growth was\r\ndeclining, the body could probably have solidified slowly and\r\nsuccessively from center out to surface. In later slow\r\ndepositions of materials, the denser substance would not be\r\nable to sink down to the deepest strata: they must lie within a\r\nlimited depth and horizontal distance from where they fell, and\r\nthe outer stratum of the Earth would be heterogeneous in\r\ndensity.\r\n\r\nThe simplest hypothesis we can make concerning the Earth's deep\r\ninterior is that the chief ingredient is iron; perhaps a full\r\nhalf of the volume is iron. The normal density of iron is 7.8,\r\nand of rock formations about 2.8. If these are mixed, half and\r\nhalf, the average density is 5.3. Pressures in the Earth should\r\nincrease the density and the heat in the Earth should decrease\r\nthe density. The known density of the Earth is 5.5. We know\r\nthat iron is plentiful in the Earth's crust, and that iron is\r\nstill falling upon the Earth in the form of meteorites. The\r\ncomposition of the Earth as a whole, on this assumption, is\r\nvery similar to the composition of the meteorites in general.\r\nThey include many of the metals, but especially iron, and they\r\ninclude a large proportion of stony matter. Iron is plentiful\r\nin the Sun and throughout the stellar universe. Why should it\r\nnot be equally plentiful in the materials which have coalesced\r\nto form the Earth? It is difficult to explain the Earth's\r\nconstitution on any other hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe Earth's form is that which its rotation period demands.\r\nUndoubtedly if the period has changed, the form has changed.\r\nGiven a little time, solids under great pressure flow quite\r\nreadily into new forms. Now any great slowing-down of the\r\nEarth's rotation period within geological times would be\r\nexpected to show in the surface features. The strata should\r\nhave wrinkled, so to speak, in the equatorial regions and\r\nstretched in the polar regions, if the Earth changed from a\r\nspheroid that was considerably flatter than it now is, to its\r\npresent form. Mountains, as evidence of the folding of the rock\r\nstrata, should exist in profusion in the torrid zone, and be\r\nscarce in or absent from the higher latitudes of the Earth.\r\nSuch differential effects do not exist, and it seems to follow\r\nthat changes in the Earth's rotation period and in its form\r\ncould have been only slight while the stratification of our\r\nrocks was in progress.\r\n\r\nGeologists estimate from the deposition of salt in the oceans,\r\nand from the rates of denudation and sedimentation, that the\r\nformation of the rock strata has consumed from 60,000,000 to\r\n100,000,000 years. If the Earth had substantially its present\r\nform 80,000,000 years ago we are safe in saying that the period\r\nof time represented in the building up of the Earth from a\r\nsmall nucleus to its present dimensions has been vastly longer,\r\nprobably reckoned in the thousands of millions of years.\r\n\r\nFor more than a century past the problem of the evolution of\r\nthe stars, including the solar system and the Earth, has\r\noccupied the central place in astronomical thought. No one is\r\nbold enough to say that the problem has been solved. The chief\r\ndifficulty proceeds from the fact that we have only one Earth,\r\none solar system and one stellar system available for tests of\r\nthe hypotheses proposed; we should like to test them on many\r\nsystems, but this privilege is denied us. However, the search\r\nfor the truth will undoubtedly proceed at an ever increasing\r\npace, partly because of man's desire to know the truth, but\r\nchiefly, as Lessing suggested, because the investigator finds\r\nan irresistible satisfaction in the process. There is always\r\nwith him the certainty that the truth is going to be\r\nincomparably stranger and more interesting than fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA METRICAL TRAGEDY\r\n\r\nBY DR. JOS. V. COLLINS\r\n\r\nSTEVENS POINT, WIS.\r\n\r\nTHE war in Europe has opened up a large field of trade in South\r\nAmerica. Three things especially stand in the way of its\r\ndevelopment, viz., the absence of a proper credit system, the\r\nfailure to make goods of the kind demanded and third, the use\r\nof our antiquated system of weights and measures, all the South\r\nAmerican countries employing the metric system. Of these three\r\nobstructing influences, the first two are in a fair way to be\r\nobviated soon; not so the last.\r\n\r\nIt is the use by our modern progressive country of an ancient\r\nsystem of weights and measures which it is here proposed to\r\ndiscuss and show up as an absurdity. Our present system is\r\norganized and set forth in arithmetics under some fifteen\r\nso-called \"tables.\" These tables are all different and there is\r\nno uniformity in any one table. Only one unit suggests\r\nconvenience in reductions, viz., hundredweight. It is easy to\r\nreduce from pounds to hundredweight and vice versa. Some fifty\r\nratio numbers have to be memorized or calculated from other\r\nmemorized numbers to make the common needed reductions. History\r\nshows that ancient Babylonia had tables superior to those now\r\nin use, and ancient Britain a decimal scale which was crowded\r\nout by our present system.\r\n\r\nThe metric system of weights and measures was developed in\r\nFrance about 1800 and has come to be employed over all the\r\ncivilized world except in the United States, Great Britain and\r\nRussia. The system was legalized in the United States in 1866\r\nbut not made mandatory and here we are fifty years later using\r\nthe old system, with most of the civilized world looking on us\r\nwith more or less scorn because of our belatedness.\r\n\r\nIn this age everywhere the cry is efficiency, always more\r\nefficiency. Ten thousand improvements and labor-saving devices\r\nare introduced every day. But here is an improvement and\r\nlabor-saving device which would affect the life of every person\r\nin the land and in many instances greatly affect such persons'\r\nlives, and yet almost no one really knows anything about the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nSo let us now consider the good points in the metric system\r\n(each implying corresponding elements of great weakness in the\r\ncommon system), and then study briefly what stands in the way\r\nof its adoption in this country. These good points are:\r\n\r\nFirst, the metric units have uniform self-defining names (cent,\r\nmill, meter and five more out of the eleven terms used already\r\nfamiliar to us in English words), are always the same in all\r\nlands, known everywhere, and fixed with scientific accuracy.\r\n\r\nSecond, every REDUCTION is made almost instantaneously by\r\nmerely moving the decimal point. There are no reductions\r\nperformed by multiplying by 1,728 or 5,280, etc., or dividing\r\nby 5 1/2, 30 1/4 or 31 1/2, etc., and hence there is A GREAT\r\nSAVING in the labor and time of making necessary calculations.\r\n\r\nThird, there are but FIVE tables in the metric system proper,\r\nthese taking the place of from twelve to fifteen in our system\r\n(or lack of it). These are linear, square, cubic, capacity and\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nFourth, any one table is about as easy to learn as our United\r\nStates money table, and after one is learned, it is much easier\r\nto learn the others, since the same prefixes with the same\r\nmeanings are used in all.\r\n\r\nFifth, the weights of all objects are either known directly\r\nfrom their size, or can be very quickly found from their\r\nspecific gravities.\r\n\r\nSixth, the subject is made so much easier for children in\r\nschool that a conservative expert estimate of the saving is two\r\nthirds of a year in a child's school life. The rule in this\r\ncountry is eight years of arithmetic, the arithmetic occupying\r\nabout one fourth of the child's activity. With metric\r\narithmetic substituted for ours, what it now takes two years to\r\nprepare for, could be easily done in 1 1/3 years. This involves\r\nan enormous waste of money and energy every twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nSeventh, only ONE set of measures and ONE set of weights are\r\nneeded to measure and weigh everything, and ONE set of machines\r\nto make things for the world's use. There would be no\r\nduplication of costly machinery to enter the foreign trade\r\nfield, thus securing enormous saving. It is well known that the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain have lost a vast amount of\r\nforeign commerce in competition with Germany and France,\r\nbecause of their non-use of the metric units. Britain realizes\r\nthis and is greatly concerned over the situation.\r\n\r\nEighth, every ordinary practical problem can be solved\r\nconveniently on an adding machine. Our adding machines are used\r\nalmost solely for United States money problems.\r\n\r\nNinth, no valuable time is lost in making reductions from\r\ncommon to metric units, or vice versa, either by ourselves or\r\nforeigners. To make our sizes in manufactured goods concrete to\r\nthem foreign customers have to reduce our measures to theirs\r\nand this is a weariness to the flesh.\r\n\r\nTenth, the metric system is wonderfully simple. All the tables\r\nwith a rule to make all possible reductions can be put on a\r\npostal card.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] See article by the writer in Education (Boston), Dec.,\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe metric weights and measures constitute a SCIENTIFIC SYSTEM;\r\nour weights and measures are a DISORGANIZATION. Naturally one\r\ncan expect a GREAT SAVING OF TIME, THOUGHT AND LABOR from the\r\nuse of a system, and this is the fact. If one dared introduce\r\nordinary arithmetical problems into an article like this, it\r\nwould be easy to show by examples how a person has to be\r\nsomething of a master of common fractions in order to solve in\r\nour system common every-day problems, whereas in the metric\r\nsystem nearly everything is done very simply with decimals. In\r\nour system a mechanic after making a complicated calculation\r\nwith common fractions is as likely as not to get his result in\r\nsixths, or ninths, etc., of an inch, whereas his rule reads to\r\neighths, or sixteenths, and he must reduce his sixths, or\r\nninths, to eighths, or sixteenths, before he can measure off\r\nhis result. In the metric system results always come out in\r\nunits of the scale used. The metric system measures to\r\nmillimeters or to a unit a trifle larger than a thirty-second\r\nof an inch. In our system one is likely to avoid sixteenths or\r\nthirty-seconds on account of the labor of calculation. Then,\r\nbesides, the amount of figuring is so much less in the metric\r\nsystem. Take the case of a certain problem to find the cubical\r\ncontents of a box. Our solution calls for 80 figures and the\r\nmetric for 35, and this is a typical case, not one specially\r\nselected. Thus, metric calculations, while only from one third\r\nto two thirds as long, are likely to be two or three times as\r\naccurate, are far easier to understand, and the results can be\r\nimmediately measured off. Hence, we waste time in these four\r\nways. Shakespeare in Hamlet says: \"Thus conscience does make\r\ncowards of us all.\" In like vein it might be said: Thus custom\r\n(in weights and measures) doth make April fools of us all. It\r\nis no exaggeration to say that counting grown-ups solving\r\nactual problems and children solving problems in school we are\r\nsent on much more than a billion such April fool errands round\r\nRobin Hood's barn every year.\r\n\r\nNoting how much time is saved in making simple every-day\r\ncalculations by using the metric system, suppose that we assume\r\nof the 60 or more millions of adults in active life in this\r\ncountry, on the average only one in 60 makes such calculations\r\ndaily and that only twenty minutes' time is saved each day. Let\r\nus suppose that the value of the time of the users is put at\r\n$2.40 per day or 10 cents for 20 minutes. Then 1,000,000 users\r\nwould save $100,000 per day or $30,000,000 per year. But\r\nperhaps some one is saying that much of this time is not really\r\nsaved, since many persons are paid for their time and can just\r\nas well do this work as not. The answer to this is that in many\r\ninstances such calculations take the time of OTHERS as well as\r\nthe person making the calculation. Occasionally a contractor\r\nmight hold back, or work to a disadvantage a gang of a score of\r\nworkmen while trying to solve a problem that came up\r\nunexpectedly.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the value of all weighing and measuring\r\ninstruments places the sum at $150,000,000. Thus, we see that\r\nin five years, merely by a saving in TIME--for time is\r\nmoney--all metric measuring and weighing instruments could be\r\ngot NEW at no extra expense. This estimate of the cost of\r\nreplacing our weighing and measuring instruments by new metric\r\nones and of saving time has been made by others with a similar\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nA matter of very much more importance than that just discussed\r\nis the extra unnecessary expense put upon education, viz., two\r\nthirds of a year for every child in the land. Presumably if the\r\nmetric system were in use with us, all our children would stay\r\nin school as long as they now do, thus getting two thirds of a\r\nyear farther along in the course of study. Actually, if\r\narithmetic were made more simple, vast numbers would; stay\r\nlonger, since they would not be driven out of school by the\r\nterrible inroads on their interest in school work by dull and\r\nto them impossible arithmetic. If metric arithmetic texts were\r\nsubstituted for our present texts, it is safe to say children\r\nwould average one full year more of education. What the\r\nincreased earning power would be from this it would be hard to\r\nestimate, but clearly it would be a huge sum.\r\n\r\nConsider also how much more life would be worth living for\r\nchildren, teachers and parents if a very large portion of\r\narithmetical puzzles inserted to qualify the children to\r\nunderstand our crazy weights and measures were cut out of our\r\ntext-books. If we were to adopt the metric system, literally\r\nmillions of parents would be spared worry, and shame, and fear\r\nlest Johnny fail and drop out of school, or Mary show\r\nunexpected weakness and have to take a grade over again;\r\nuncounted thousands of teachers would be saved much gnashing of\r\nteeth and uttering of mild feminine imprecations under their\r\nbreath; and, best of all, the children themselves would be\r\nsaved from pencil-biting, tears, worries, heartburns, arrested\r\ndevelopment, shame and loss of education!\r\n\r\nA committee of the National Educational Association has\r\nrecently reported that Germany and France are each two full\r\nyears ahead of us in educational achievement, that is, children\r\nin those countries of a certain age have as good an education\r\nas our children which are two years the foreign childrens'\r\nseniors. Surely one of these years is fully accounted for by\r\nthe inferiority of our American ARITHMETIC and SPELLING. This\r\nmuch, at least, of the difference is neither in the children\r\nthemselves, nor in the lack of preparation of our teachers, nor\r\nin educational methods.\r\n\r\nProfessor J. W. A. Young, of the University of Chicago, in his\r\nwork on \"Mathematics in Prussia,\" says: \"In the work in\r\nmathematics done in the nine years from the age of nine on, we\r\nAmericans accomplish no more than the Prussians, while we give\r\nto the work seven fourths of the time the Germans give.\"\r\nProfessor James Pierpont, of Yale, writing in the Bulletin of\r\nthe American Mathematical Society (April, 1900), shows a like\r\ncomparison can be made with French instruction. Pierpont's\r\ntable exhibits only one hour a week needed for arithmetic for\r\npupils aged 11 and 12! As the advertisements sometimes say,\r\nthere must be a reason.\r\n\r\nBut if the children are kept in school two thirds of a year\r\nlonger somebody pays for this extra expense. Now children do\r\nnot drop out of school until they are about 12 years of age and\r\nhave both appetites and earning power. The number of these\r\nchildren that drop out each year is probably about 2 1/2\r\nmillions. Of this number let us say 1 1/2  millions would\r\nbecome wage earners, thus passing from the class that are\r\nsupported to the class that support themselves and earn a small\r\nwage besides. We have then three items in this count: (1) The\r\ncost to the state in taxes for the education of 2 1/2 million\r\nfor two thirds of a year, or $50,000,000; (2) The cost to the\r\nparents for support of 1 1/2 millions for two thirds of a year\r\nat $67 each, or $100,000,000; (3) The wages of 1 1/2  millions\r\nover and above the cost of their support, say $50 each, or\r\n$75,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe above figures are put low purposely so that they can not be\r\ncriticized. It should be remembered that 46 per cent. of our\r\npopulation is agricultural, and that on the farm, youths of\r\nfrom 13 to 15 very often do men's and women's work: also that\r\nin many manufacturing centers great numbers of children get\r\nwork at relatively good wages, and that the number of\r\ncompletely idle children out of school is not large.\r\n\r\nWith these figures in hand let us consider now a kind of debit\r\nand credit sheet against and for our present system of weights\r\nand measures.\r\n\r\nPRESENT SYSTEM OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES\r\n\r\nIn ANNUAL account with UNCLE SAM\r\n\r\nCr.\r\nBy culture (?) acquired by the\r\nchildren through learning more\r\ncommon fractions and our crazy\r\ntables of weights and measures.......... $?\r\n\r\nDr.\r\nTo cost in school taxes of keeping 2 1/2\r\nmillions of children in school 2/3 year. $50,000,000\r\nTo cost to parents for supporting 1 1/2\r\nmillions children 2/3 year............. 100,000,000\r\nTo loss of productive power of 1 1/2\r\nmillions youth for 2/3 year ............. 75,000,000\r\nTo loss of earning power by having\r\nchildren driven out of school by\r\ndifficulties of arithmetic as now\r\ntaught .................................... 25,000,000\r\nTo loss of time in making arithmetical\r\ncalculations by men in trade, industries\r\nand manufactures.......................... 30,000,000\r\nTo extra weighing and measuring\r\ninstruments needed for sundry tables....... 10,000,000\r\nTo loss of time in making cross reductions\r\nto and from our system and\r\nmetric system .............................. 5,000,000\r\nTo loss of profit from foreign trade\r\nbecause our goods are not in metric\r\nunits ..................................... 20,000,000\r\n                                          ------------\r\n       Total annual loss ................. $315,000,000\r\n\r\nCommenting for a moment on the credit side of the above ledger\r\naccount, it can be said that recent psychology shows\r\nconclusively that training in common fractions and weights and\r\nmeasures can not be of much practical help as so-called\r\nculture, or training for learning other things, unless those\r\nother things are closely related to them, and there are not\r\nmany things in life so related to them once we had dropped our\r\npresent weights and measures.\r\n\r\nIt may be complained that the expense of changing to the new\r\nsystem is not taken account of in the above table. The reason\r\nis that that expense would occur once for all. The above table\r\ndeals with the ANNUAL cost of our present medieval system.\r\n\r\nOne powerful reason for the adoption of the metric system\r\ndifferent in character from the others is the ease of cheating\r\nby the old system. In the past the people have been\r\nunmercifully abused through short weights and measures. Many of\r\nthe states have taken this matter up latterly and prosecuted\r\nmerchants right and left. Nine tenths of this trouble would\r\ndisappear with the new system in use.\r\n\r\nLet us consider now for a little time the reasons why the\r\nmetric system has not been accepted and adopted for use in the\r\nUnited States. Evidently the great main reason has been that\r\nthe masses of the people, in fact all of them except a very\r\nsmall educated class in science are almost totally uninformed\r\non this whole question. Such articles as have been published\r\nhave almost invariably appeared in either scientific, technical\r\nor educational magazines, mostly the first, so that there has\r\nbeen no means of reaching the masses, or even the school\r\nteachers with the facts. For another reason the United States\r\noccupies an isolated position geographically, and our people do\r\nnot come into personal contact with those in other countries\r\nusing the metric system. But there is still another potent\r\nreason. After the United States government legalized the metric\r\nsystem in 1866, all the school books on arithmetic began\r\npresenting the topic of the metric system, and, quite\r\nnaturally, they did it by comparing its units with those of our\r\nsystem and calling for cross reductions from one system to the\r\nother. No better means of sickening the American children with\r\nthe metric system could have been devised. Multitudes of the\r\nyoung formed a strong dislike for the foreign system with its\r\nforeign names, and could not now be easily convinced that it is\r\nnot difficult to learn. Every school boy knows how easy it is\r\nto learn United States money. The boy just naturally learns it\r\nbetween two nights. The whole metric system UNDER FAVORABLE\r\nCONDITIONS is learned nearly as easily. By favorable conditions\r\nis meant the constant use of the system in homes, schools,\r\nstores, etc. These favorable conditions, of course, we have\r\nnever had.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 an earnest effort was made again both in this country\r\nand Great Britain to have the metric system adopted for general\r\nuse. The exporting manufacturers in both countries grew much\r\nconcerned over the whole situation. A petition to have the\r\nmetric system adopted in Great Britain was signed by over\r\n2,000,000 persons. A bill to make the system mandatory was\r\npassed by the House of Lords and its first reading in the House\r\nof Commons. The forces of conservatism then bestirred\r\nthemselves and the bill was held up. Forseeing a movement of\r\nthe same kind in this country, the American Manufactures'\r\nAssociation got busy, laid plans to defeat such movement which\r\nthey later did. Strictly speaking this action was not taken by\r\nthe association as such but only by a part of it. One fourth of\r\nthe membership and probably much more than a fourth of the\r\ncapital of the association was on the side for the adoption of\r\nthe system. Politically, however, the side opposed to the new\r\nsystem had altogether the most influence.\r\n\r\nCareful study of the whole matter showed that the main cost to\r\nmake the change to the new system would be in dies, patterns,\r\ngauges, jigs, etc. A careful estimate put this cost at $600 for\r\neach workman and assuming a million workmen, we have a total\r\ncost of $600,000,000. But we have just seen that the annual\r\nexpense of retaining the old system of weights and measures is\r\nover $300,000,000. Thus we see that two short years would\r\nsuffice to pay for what seems to the great manufacturers\r\nassociation an insuperable expense. From all this we see that\r\nthe question is not one for N. M. A. bookkeeping, but for\r\nnational bookkeeping.\r\n\r\nMany well-informed people studying the matter superficially,\r\nthink the difficulties in the way of a change to the new system\r\ninsurmountable. Thus, they think of the cost to the\r\nmanufacturer--which we have just seen to be rather large but\r\nnot insurmountable; they think of the changes needed in books,\r\nrecords, such as deeds, and the substitution of new measuring\r\nand weighing instruments. Germany and all the other countries\r\nof continental Europe made the change. Are we to assume that\r\nthe United States can not? That would be ridiculous. Granting\r\nthat commerce has grown greatly, so also has intelligence and\r\ncapability of the people for doing great things.\r\n\r\nScientists are universally agreed as to the wisdom of the\r\nadoption of the metric system. The country, as a whole, must be\r\neducated up to the notion that sooner or later it is sure to be\r\nuniversally adopted, that it is only a question of time when\r\nthis will be done. Already electrical, chemical and optical\r\nmanufacturing concerns use the metric units and system\r\nexclusively. The system is also used widely in medicine and\r\nstill other arts. Then all institutions of learning use the\r\nmetric system exclusively whenever this is possible. All that\r\nis needed is to complete a good work well begun.\r\n\r\nThere is one rational objection to the metric system and but\r\none. It is that 10 is inferior to 12 as a base for a notation\r\nfor numbers, but the world is not ready to make this change nor\r\nis it likely to be for generations to come. Moreover, this\r\nimprovement is far less important than uniformity in weights\r\nand measures. For these reasons this objection can be passed\r\nover. Men said the metric system would never be used outside of\r\nFrance; but it has come to be used all over the world. The\r\nprophets said we should never have uniformity as regards a\r\nreference meridian of longitude. But we have. And so it will be\r\nwith the adoption of the metric system in the United States and\r\nGreat Britain. It is only a question of whether it comes sooner\r\nor later. When that day comes, the meter, a long yard, will\r\nreplace the yard, the liter, the quart (being smaller than a\r\ndry and larger than a liquid quart), the kilogram will replace\r\nthe pound, being equal to 2.2 pounds, and the kilometer (.6\r\nmi.) will replace the mile. Within a week or so after the\r\nchange has been made to the new system, all men in business\r\nwill be reasonably familiar with the new units and how they are\r\nused, and within a few months every man, woman and child will\r\nbe as familiar with the new system as they ever were with the\r\nsimplest parts of the old. So easy it will be to make the\r\nchange as far as ordinary business affairs are concerned.\r\nHowever, for exact metal manufactures years will be needed to\r\nfully change over to the new. Here the plan is to begin with\r\nnew unit constructions and new models, as automobiles using new\r\nmachinery constructed in the integral units of the metric\r\nsystem. All old constructions are left as they are and repaired\r\nas they are. This was the plan used in Germany and of course it\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it can be said that we started with the idea that\r\nthe change to the metric system was needed for the sake of\r\nforeign commerce. We now see that we need it also for our own\r\ncommercial and manufacturing transactions. If we are to have\r\nthe efficiency so insistently demanded by the age in which we\r\nlive, then we must have the metric system in use for the\r\nordinary affairs of daily life of the masses of the people, we\r\nmust have it in commercial and manufacturing industries, and we\r\nmust have it in education. If efficiency is to be the slogan,\r\nthen the metric system must come no matter what obstacles stand\r\nin its way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADAPTATION AS A PROCESS\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR HARRY BEAL TORREY\r\n\r\nREED COLLEGE\r\n\r\nFOR the physicist and chemist the term adaptation awakens but\r\nthe barren echo of an idea. In biology it still retains a\r\ncertain standing, though its significance has, in recent years,\r\nbeen rapidly contracting, as the influence of the conception\r\nfor which it stands has waned. Many biologists are now of the\r\nopinion that their science would be better off entirely without\r\nit. They believe it has not only outlived its usefulness, but\r\nhas become a source of confusion, if not, indeed, reaction.\r\n\r\nDarwin's first task, in the \"Origin of Species,\" was to\r\ndemonstrate that species had not been independently created,\r\nbut had descended, like varieties, from other species. But he\r\nwas well aware that\r\n\r\nsuch a conclusion, even if well founded, would be\r\nunsatisfactory until it could be shown how the innumerable\r\nspecies inhabiting the world have been modified, so as to\r\nacquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which\r\njustly excites our admiration.\r\n\r\nTo establish convincingly the doctrine of descent with\r\nmodification as a theory of species, it was necessary for him\r\nto develop the theory of adaptation which we now know as\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nThe origin of adaptive variations gave him, at that time,\r\nlittle concern. Though keenly appreciative of the problem of\r\nvariation which his studies in evolution presented, he\r\ndismissed it in the \"Origin\" with less than twenty-five pages\r\nof discussion. Such brevity is not surprising, since a more\r\nextended treatment would only have embarrassed the progress of\r\nthe argument. In fact, his restraint in this direction enabled\r\nhim, first, to avoid the difficulties into which Lamarck, with\r\nhis bold attack on the problem of variation, had fallen; and\r\nsecond, by doing so, to deal the doctrine of Design a blow from\r\nwhich it has never recovered.\r\n\r\nThe latter was a service of well-nigh incalculable value to the\r\nyoung science of biology--and, as it appeared, to modern\r\ncivilization as well. But it has not been uncommon, from\r\nAristotle's day to this, for the work of great men to suffer at\r\nthe hands of less imaginative followers. Sweeping applications\r\nof Darwin's doctrine have been repeatedly made without due\r\nregard either for its original object or for the success with\r\nwhich that object was achieved. So I believe it to be no fault\r\nof Darwin that the growing indifference of European\r\nlaboratories toward natural selection should find occasional\r\nexpression in such a phrase as \"the English disease.\" Disease,\r\nindeed, I believe we must in candor admit that devotion to it\r\nto be which blinds its devotees to those problems of more\r\nelementary importance than the problem of adaptation, which\r\nDarwin clearly saw but was born too soon to solve.\r\n\r\nThe problem of species has profoundly changed since 1859. For\r\nDarwin it was perforce a problem of adaptation. For the\r\ninvestigator of to-day it has become a part of the more\r\ninclusive problem of variation. Along with the logical results\r\nof natural selection he contemplates the biological processes\r\nof organic differentiation. He is no longer satisfied to assume\r\nthe existence of those modifications that make selection\r\npossible. In his efforts to control them, the conception of\r\nadaptation as a result has been crowded from the center of his\r\ninterest by the conception of adaptation as a process.\r\n\r\nThe survival of specially endowed organisms, the elimination of\r\ncompeting individuals not thus endowed, are facts that possess,\r\nin themselves, no immediate biological significance. Selection\r\nas such is not a biological process, whether it is accomplished\r\nautomatically on the basis of protective coloration, or\r\nself-consciously by man. Separating sheep from goats may have a\r\npurely commercial interest, as when prunes and apples, gravel\r\nand bullets, are graded for the market. Such selection is, at\r\nbottom, a method of classification, serving the same general\r\npurpose as boxes in a post-office. Similarly, natural selection\r\nis but a name for the segregation and classification that take\r\nplace automatically in the great struggle for existence in\r\nnature. The fact that it is a result rather than a process\r\naccounts, probably more than anything else, for its remarkable\r\neffect upon modern thought. It is non-energetic. It exerts no\r\ncreative force. As a conception of passive mechanical\r\nsegregation and survival, it was a most timely and potent\r\nsubstitute for the naive teleology involved in the idea of\r\nspecial creation.\r\n\r\nAs a theory of adaptation, then, natural selection is\r\nsatisfactory only in so far as it accounts for the\r\n\"preservation of favored races.\" It throws no light upon the\r\norigin of the variations with which races are favored. Since it\r\nis only as variations possess a certain utility for the\r\norganism that they become known as adaptations, the conception\r\nof adaptation is inevitably associated with the welfare of\r\nindividuals or the survival of races. To disregard this\r\nassociation is to rob the conception of all meaning. Like\r\nhealth, it has no elementary physiological significance.\r\n\r\nOur profound interest in the problem of survival is natural and\r\npractical and inevitable. But in spite of Darwin's great\r\ncontribution toward a scientific analysis of the mechanism of\r\norganic evolution, and in spite of the marvelous recent\r\nprogress of medicine along its many branches, the fact remains\r\nthat so far as this interest in the problem of survival is\r\ndominant it must continue to hinder adequate analysis of the\r\nproblem of adaptation. Indeed, it is in large measure due to\r\nsuch domination in the past that biology now lags so far behind\r\nthe less personal sciences of physics and chemistry. For\r\nsurvival means the survival of an individual. And there is no\r\ndoubt that the individual organism is the most conspicuous\r\ndatum in the living world. The few who, neglectful of\r\nindividuals and survivals, find their chief interest in living\r\nsubstance, its properties and processes, are promptly\r\nchallenged by the many to find living substance save in the\r\nbody of an organism. Thus, in a peculiarly significant sense,\r\norganisms are vital units. And since the individual organism\r\nshows a remarkable capacity to retain its identity under a wide\r\nrange of conditions, adaptability or adjustability comes to be\r\nreckoned as the prime characteristic of life by all to whom the\r\nintegrity of the individual organism is the fact of chief\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nWith the use of the words adaptability and adjustability, our\r\ndiscussion assumes a somewhat different aspect. Instead of\r\ncontemplating further the mechanical selection of individuals\r\non the basis of characters that, like the structure of \"the\r\nwoodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak and tongue, so admirably\r\nadapted to catch insects under the bark of trees,\" can not be\r\nattributed to the influence of the external conditions that\r\nrender them useful, we are invited to consider immediate and\r\nplastic adjustments of the organism to the very conditions that\r\ncall forth the response. For the fortuitous adjustments that\r\ntend to preserve those individuals or races that chance to\r\npossess them, are substituted, accordingly, the direct primary\r\nadjustments that tend to preserve the identity of the reacting\r\norganism. We turn thus from the RESULTS of the selection of\r\nfavorable variations to the biological PROCESSES by which\r\norganisms become accommodated to their conditions of life.\r\n\r\nAt once the old questions arise. Are these processes\r\nfundamentally peculiar to the life of organisms? Does the\r\ncapacity of the organism thus to adjust itself to its\r\nenvironment involve factors not found in the operations of\r\ninorganic nature? Our answers will be determined essentially by\r\nthe nature of our interest in the organism--whether we regard\r\nits existence as the END or merely an incidental EFFECT of its\r\nactivities. The first alternative is compatible with\r\nthoroughgoing vitalism. The second, emphasizing the nature of\r\nthe processes rather than their usefulness to the organism,\r\nrelieves biology of the embarrassments of vitalistic\r\nspeculation, and allies it at the same time more intimately\r\nthan ever with physics and chemistry. This alliance promises so\r\nwell for the analysis of adaptations, as to demand our serious\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically, the living organism may be thought of as a\r\nphysico-chemical system of great complexity and peculiar\r\ncomposition which varies from organism to organism and from\r\npart to part. Life itself may be defined as a group of\r\ncharacteristic activities dependent upon the transformations in\r\nthis system under appropriate conditions. According to this\r\ndefinition, life is determined not only by the physical and\r\nchemical attributes of the system, but by the fitness of its\r\nenvironment, which Henderson has recently done the important\r\nservice of emphasizing.[1] Relatively trifling changes in the\r\nenvironment suffice to render it unfit, however, that is, to\r\nmodify it beyond the limits of an organism's adaptability. The\r\nenvironmental limits are narrow, then, within which the\r\ntransformations of the organic system can take place that are\r\nassociated with adaptive reactions. The conditions within these\r\nlimits are, further, peculiarly favorable for just such\r\ntransformations in just such physico-chemical systems.\r\n\r\n[1] \"The Fitness of the Environment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essential characteristic of the adaptive reaction appears\r\nto be that the organism concerned responds to changing\r\nconditions without losing certain attributes of behavior by\r\nwhich we recognize organisms in general and by which that\r\norganism is recognized in particular. It exhibits stability in\r\nthe midst of change; it retains its identity. But this\r\nstability, let us repeat, is the stability of a certain type of\r\nphysico-chemical system, with respect to certain characters\r\nonly, and exhibited under certain circumscribed conditions. In\r\nso far as the problem of adaptation is thus restricted in its\r\napplication, it remains a question of standards, a taxonomic\r\nconvenience, a problem of the organism by definition only,\r\nempty of fundamental significance.\r\n\r\nIt is to be expected that systems differing widely in\r\ncomposition and structure will differ in their responses to\r\ngiven conditions. This will be true whether the systems\r\ncompared thus are organic, or inorganic, or representative of\r\nboth groups. The compounds of carbon, of which living substance\r\nis so characteristically composed, exhibit properties and\r\nreactions that distinguish them at once in many respects from\r\nthe compounds of lead or sulphur. They also differ widely among\r\nthemselves; compare, in this connection, serum albumen, acetic\r\nacid, cane sugar, urea. No vitalistic factor is needed for the\r\ninterpretation of divergencies of this kind. But there are many\r\nsignificant similarities between organisms and inorganic\r\nsystems as well. These are so frequently overlooked that it\r\nwill now be desirable to consider a few illustrative cases. For\r\nthe sake of brevity, they have been selected as representative\r\nof but two types of adaptation commonly known under the names\r\nof ACCLIMATIZATION and REGULATION.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the case of organisms which become\r\nacclimatized by slow degrees to new conditions that, suddenly\r\nimposed, would produce fatal results. Hydra is an organism\r\nwhich becomes thus acclimatized finally to solutions of\r\nstrychnine too strong to be endured at first. Outwardly it\r\nappears to suffer in the process no obvious modifications. Yet\r\nmodifications of a physiological order take place, as is shown,\r\nfirst, by the necessary deliberation of the acclimatization,\r\nsecond, by the death of the organism if transferred abruptly\r\nback to its original environment.\r\n\r\nIn other forms the structural changes accompanying\r\nacclimatization may be far more conspicuous. For example, the\r\naerial leaves of Limnophila heterophylla are dentate, while\r\nthose grown under water are excessively divided. Again, the\r\nhelmets and caudal spines of Hyalodaphnia vary greatly in\r\nlength with the seasonal temperature.\r\n\r\nIn these and the large number of similar cases that might be\r\ncited, stability of the physiological system under changed\r\nconditions is only obtained by changes in the system itself\r\nwhich are often exhibited by striking structural modifications.\r\n\r\nCompare with such phenomena of acclimatization the responses of\r\nsulphur, tin, liquid crystals and iron alloys to changes of\r\ntemperature. The rhombic crystals that characterize sulphur at\r\nordinary temperatures and pressures, give place to monoclinic\r\ncrystals at 95.5 degrees C. Sulphur thus exists with two\r\ncrystalline forms whose stability depends directly upon the\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, tin exists under two stable forms, white and gray,\r\nthe one above, the other below the transitional point, which\r\nis, in this case, 18 degrees C. At this temperature white tin\r\nis in a metastable condition, and transforms into the gray\r\nvariety. The transformation goes on, then, at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, but, fortunately for us as users of tin\r\nimplements, very slowly. Its velocity can be increased,\r\nhowever, by lowering the temperature, on which, then, not only\r\nthe transformation itself, but its rate depends.\r\n\r\nIn this connection may be mentioned cholesteryl acetate and\r\nbenzoate and other substances which possess two crystalline\r\nphases, one of which is liquid, unlike other liquids, however,\r\nin being anisotropic. As in the preceding cases, these phases\r\nare expressions of equilibrium at different temperatures.\r\n\r\nEspecially instructive facts are afforded by the alloys of iron\r\nand carbon. Iron, or ferrite, exists under three forms: as\r\nalpha ferrite below 760 degrees, as beta ferrite between 760\r\ndegrees and 900 degrees, and as gamma ferrite above 900\r\ndegrees. Only the last is able to hold carbon in solid\r\nsolution. The alloys of iron and carbon exist under several\r\nforms. Pearlite is a heterogeneous mixture containing 0.8 per\r\ncent. carbon. When heated to 670 degrees, it becomes\r\nhomogeneous, an amount of carbon up to two per cent. dissolves\r\nin the iron, and hard steel or martensite is formed. In\r\nappearance, however, the two forms are so nearly identical as\r\nto be discriminated only by careful microscopical examination.\r\nCementite is a definite compound of iron and carbon represented\r\nby the formula Fe<3 subscript>C.\r\n\r\nWhen cooled slowly below 670 degrees, martensite yields a\r\nheterogeneous mixture of pearlite and ferrite (or cementite, if\r\nthe original mixture contained between 0.8 per cent. and two\r\nper cent. of carbon). Soft steels and wrought iron are thus\r\nobtained. When cooled rapidly, however, as in the tempering of\r\nsteel, martensite remains a homogeneous solid solution, or hard\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nOne can not fail to notice the remarkable parallel between\r\nthese facts and the behavior of Hydra in the presence of\r\nstrychnine. In both cases new positions of stability are\r\nreached by modifying the original conditions of stability; and\r\nin both, the old positions of stability are regained only by\r\nreturns to the original conditions of stability so gradual as\r\nto afford time sufficient for the necessary transformations in\r\nthe systems themselves.\r\n\r\nThe forms which both organic and inorganic systems assume thus\r\nappear to be functions of the conditions in which they exist.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Hydra is able to regain a position of stability\r\nfrom which it had been displaced connects the behavior of this\r\norganism not only with the physical phenomena already cited,\r\nbut still more intimately with the large class of chemical\r\nreactions which are similarly characterized by equilibrium and\r\nreversibility. Such reactions do not proceed to completion,\r\nwhich is probably always the case wherever the mixture of the\r\nsystems under transformation is homogeneous, as in the case of\r\nsolutions. They occur widely among carbon compounds. The\r\nfollowing typical case will suffice to indicate their essential\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nWhen ethyl alcohol and acetic acid are mixed, a reaction ensues\r\nwhich yields ethyl acetate and water. But ethyl acetate and\r\nwater react together also, yielding ethyl alcohol and acetic\r\nacid. This second reaction, in a direction opposite to the\r\nfirst, proceeds in the beginning more slowly also. There comes\r\na time, however, when the speeds of the two reactions are\r\nequal. A position of equilibrium or apparent rest is thus\r\nreached, which persists as long as the relative proportions of\r\nthe component substances remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nA great many reversible reactions are made possible by enzymes.\r\nIn the presence of diastase, glucose yields glycogen and water,\r\nwhich, reacting together in the opposite direction, yield\r\nglucose again. In the presence of emulsin, amygdalin is\r\ndecomposed into glucose, hydrocyanic acid and benzoic aldehyde,\r\nand reformed from them. Similarly in the presence of lipase,\r\nesters are reformed from alcohols and fatty acids, their\r\ndecomposition products.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of enzymes, certain complications ensue.\r\nThough it has been shown that lipase acts as a true catalyser,\r\nthis may not hold for all, especially for proteolytic, enzymes.\r\nThat reversible reactions actually occur in proteids, however,\r\naccompanied as they are in some cases at least by certain\r\ndisplacements of the position of equilibrium, there appears to\r\nbe no question.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] Robertson, Univ. Calif. Publ. Physiol., 3, 1909, p. 115.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese examples are but suggestions of the many reversible\r\nreactions that have now been observed among the compounds of\r\ncarbon. That they have peculiar significance for the present\r\ndiscussion resides in the fact that living substance is\r\ncomposed of carbon compounds, so many and in such exceedingly\r\ncomplex relations as to present endless possibilities for\r\nshifting equilibria and the physical and chemical adjustments\r\nresulting therefrom.\r\n\r\nWith these facts in mind we may now turn from the consideration\r\nof acclimatization to a brief discussion of certain phenomena\r\nof regulation--adaptive reactions that are especially\r\nconspicuous in the growth and development of organisms, but\r\nseparated by no sharp dividing line from adaptive reactions of\r\nthe other type.\r\n\r\nWhen a fragment of an organism transforms, under appropriate\r\nconditions, into a typical individual, the process includes\r\ndegenerative aa well as regenerative phases. There is always\r\nsome simplification of the structures present, whose character\r\nand amount is determined by the degree of specialization which\r\nhas been attained. The smaller the piece, within certain\r\nlimits, and the younger physiologically, the more nearly does\r\nit return to embryonic conditions, a fact which can be studied\r\nadmirably in the hydroid Corymorpha. In some cases the\r\nsimplification is accomplished by abrupt sacrifice of highly\r\nspecialized parts, as in Corymorpha, when in a process of\r\nsimplification connected with acclimatization to aquarium\r\nconditions, the large tentacles of well-grown specimens fall\r\naway completely from their bases. In other hydroids (e. g.,\r\nCampanularia) the tentacles may be completely absorbed into the\r\nbody of the hydranth from which they originally sprang. Among\r\ntissue cells degenerative changes may be abrupt, as in the\r\nsacrifice of the highly specialized fibrillae in muscle cells;\r\nor they may be very gradual, as in the transformation of cells\r\nof one sort into another that occurs in the regeneration of\r\ntentacles in Tubularia.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of absorption of parts came to my notice\r\nwhile studying the larvae of the pennatulid coral Renilla some\r\nfifteen years ago. As will be remembered, Renilla possesses\r\neight tentacles with numerous processes pinnately arranged.\r\nDuring a period of enforced starvation, these pinnae were\r\ngradually absorbed, and the tentacles shortened, from tip to\r\nbase. With the advent of food--in the form of annelid eggs--the\r\nreverse of these events took place. The tentacles lengthened\r\nand the pinnae reappeared, the larvae assuming their normal\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that in some circumstances at least, the\r\nprocess of simplification may resemble very nearly, even in\r\ndetails, a reversal of the process of differentiation. That one\r\nis actually in every respect the reverse of the other is\r\nundoubtedly not true. This, however, is not to be wondered at.\r\nMechanical inhibitions that are so conspicuous in some cases\r\n(e. g., Corymorpha) are to be expected to a certain degree in\r\nall. The regenerative process itself depends upon the\r\ncooperation of many physical and chemical factors, in many and\r\ncomplex physicochemical systems in varying conditions of\r\nequilibrium. And it is important to note that even the\r\nequilibrium reactions by which a single proteid in the presence\r\nof an enzyme, is made and unmade, do not appear always to\r\nfollow identically the same path in opposite directions.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] Robertson, vid. sup., p. 269.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever their course in the instances cited and in many\r\nothers, reversals in the processes of development do take\r\nplace. In perhaps their simplest form these can be seen in egg\r\ncells. The development of a fragment of an egg as a complete\r\nwhole involves reversals in the processes of differentiation of\r\na very subtle order. The fusion of two eggs to one involves\r\nsimilar readjustments. Such phenomena have been held to be\r\npeculiar to living machines only. Yet it may be pointed out\r\nthat there are counterparts of both in the behavior of\r\nso-called liquid crystals. When liquid crystals of\r\nparaazoxyzimtsaure-Athylester are divided, the parts are\r\nsmaller in size, but otherwise identical with the parent\r\ncrystal in form, structure and optical properties. The fusion\r\nof two crystals of ammonium oleate forming a single crystal of\r\nlarger size has also been observed. Though changes in\r\nequilibrium that accompany such behavior of liquid crystals are\r\nundoubtedly very much simpler than the changes that accompany\r\nthe regulatory processes exhibited by the living egg, the\r\nstriking resemblance between the phenomena themselves tempts us\r\nnot to magnify the difference.\r\n\r\nFurther temptation in the same direction is offered by the\r\nrecent discovery[4] that the processes of development\r\nstimulated in the eggs of the sea urchin Arbacia by butyric\r\nacid or weak bases, and evidenced by the formation of the\r\nfertilization membrane, is reversible. When such eggs are\r\ntreated with a weak solution of sodium cyanide or chloral\r\nhydrate, they return to the resting condition. Upon\r\nfertilization with spermatozoa, in normal sea water, they\r\nproceed again to develop.\r\n\r\n[4] Loeb, Arch. f. Entw., 28, 1914, p. 277.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts that have now been briefly summarized have been\r\nselected to emphasize the growing intimacy between the\r\nbiological and the inorganic sciences. No harm can conceivably\r\ncome from it. On the contrary, there is every reason to be\r\nhopeful that the investigation of biological problems in the\r\nimpersonal spirit that has long distinguished the maturer\r\nsciences of physics and chemistry will continue to develop a\r\nbetter control and fuller understanding of the processes in\r\nliving organisms, of which the phenomena of variation in\r\ngeneral, and of adaptation in particular, are but incidental\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY CERTAIN PLANTS ARE ACRID\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR WILLIAM B. LAZENBY\r\n\r\nOHIO STATE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nEVER since my first lessons in botany, the characteristic\r\nqualities and properties of plants have given me much thought.\r\nWhy certain plants produced aromatic oils and ethers, while\r\nothers growing under the same conditions produced special acids\r\nor alkaloids, was a subject of endless speculation.\r\n\r\nThe pleasing aroma of the bark of various trees and shrubs, the\r\nspicy qualities of the foliage and seeds of other plants; the\r\nintense acridity; the bitterness; the narcotic, the poisonous\r\nprinciple in woody and herbaceous species; all were intensely\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThis interest was biological rather than chemical. I cared less\r\nfor the ultimate composition of the oils, acids, alkalis, etc.,\r\nthan I did for their use or office in the plant economy, and\r\ntheir effect upon those who might use them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one plant interested me more from this point of\r\nview, than the well-known Indian turnip (Arisoema triphyllum).\r\nAs a boy I was well acquainted with the signally acrid quality\r\nof this plant; I was well aware of its effect when chewed, yet\r\nI was irresistibly drawn to taste it again and again. It was\r\never a painful experience, and I suffered the full penalty of\r\nmy rashness. As an awn from a bearded head of barley will win\r\nits disputed way up one's sleeve, and gain a point in advance\r\ndespite all effort to stop or expel it, so did every\r\nresolution, every reflection, counteract the very purpose it\r\nwas summoned to oppose, and to my sorrow I would taste the\r\ndrastic, turnip-shaped corm wherever opportunity occurred.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the liquid content of the cells of\r\nplants contain numerous inorganic substances in solution. Among\r\nthese, not considering oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon\r\ndioxide, there are the salts of calcium, magnesium, potassium,\r\niron, sulphur and phosphorus. The above substances are found in\r\nthe cells of every living plant. Other substances like salts of\r\nsodium and silica are also found, but these are not regarded as\r\nessential to the life and growth of plants. They appear to be\r\npresent because the plant has not the power to reject them.\r\nMany of the substances named above, are found deposited either\r\nin an amorphous or crystalline form in the substance of the\r\ncell wall. In addition to this, crystals of mineral matter,\r\nhaving various shapes and sizes, are often found in the\r\ninterior of cells. The most common of these interior cell\r\ncrystals are those composed of calcium oxalate and calcium\r\ncarbonate. Others composed of calcium phosphate, calcium\r\nsulphate and silica are sometimes found. These crystals may\r\noccur singly or in clusters of greater or less size. In shape\r\nthey are prismatic or needle-like.\r\n\r\nIt is not the object of this paper to treat of plant crystals\r\nin general, but to consider the peculiar effect produced by\r\ncertain forms when found in some well-known plants.\r\n\r\nThe extreme acridity or intense pungency of the bulbs, stems,\r\nleaves and fruit of various species of the Araceae or Arum\r\nfamily, was recognized centuries ago. The cause of this\r\ncharacteristic property or quality was, until a comparatively\r\nrecent date, not definitely determined.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware the first scientific investigation of this\r\nsubject was made by the writer. At a meeting of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science held at Indianapolis\r\nin 1890, some studies and experiments were reported in a short\r\npaper entitled \"Notes upon the Crystals in certain species of\r\nthe Arum Family.\"\r\n\r\nThis paper expressed the belief that the acridity of the Indian\r\nturnip and other plants belonging to the same family, was due\r\nto the presence of needle-shaped crystals or raphides found in\r\nthe cells of these plants. This conclusion was not accepted by\r\nProfessor T. J. Burrill, of the University of Illinois, nor by\r\nother eminent botanists who were present and took part in the\r\ndiscussion that followed the reading of the paper.\r\n\r\nThe opposition was based mainly on the well-known fact that\r\nmany other plants like the grape, rhubarb, fuchsia, spiderwort,\r\netc., are not at all, or but slightly acrid, although the\r\nraphides are as abundant in them as in the Indian turnip and\r\nits allies.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the United States Dispensatory and other works\r\non pharmacy, ascribed the following rather indefinite cause for\r\nthe acridity of the Indian turnip. It was said to be due to an\r\nacrid, extremely volatile principle. This principle was\r\ninsoluble in water and alcohol, but soluble in ether. It was\r\ndissipated both by heating and drying, and by this means the\r\nacridity is destroyed. There was no opinion given as to the\r\nreal nature of this so-called principle.\r\n\r\nMore recently it has been intimated that the acridity may be\r\ndue to some ferment or enzyme, which has been derived in part\r\nfrom the self-decomposition of protoplasm and in part by the\r\nprocess of oxidation and reduction.\r\n\r\nHere the question appeared to rest. At all events I was unable\r\nto glean any further knowledge from the sources at my command.\r\n\r\nSome time later the subject was taken up in a more\r\ncomprehensive manner and the following report is the first\r\ndetailed description of an investigation that has occupied more\r\nor less of my leisure for some years.\r\n\r\nA dozen or more species of plants have been used for\r\nexamination and study. Among these were:\r\n\r\nIndian turnip (Arisoema triphyllum).\r\nGreen dragon (Arisoema dracontium).\r\nSweet-flag (Acorus).\r\nSkunk cabbage (Spathyema).\r\nCalla (Richardia).\r\nCaladium (Caladium).\r\nCalocasia (Calocasia).\r\nPhyllodendron (Phyllodendron).\r\nFuchsia (Fuchsia).\r\nWandering Jew (Tradescantia).\r\nRhubarb (Rheum).\r\nGrape (Vitis).\r\nOnion (Allium).\r\nHorse-radish (Armoracia).\r\n\r\nMost of the plants selected were known to have crystals in\r\ncertain parts. Some of them were known to be intensely acrid.\r\nIn these the acridity was in every instance proportional to the\r\nnumber of crystals.\r\n\r\nThe following order of study was pursued and the results of\r\neach step noted. Only the more salient points of the methods\r\nemployed and the conclusions reached are presented.\r\n\r\n1. The Character of the Taste Itself.--It was readily noted\r\nthat the sensation produced by chewing the various acrid plants\r\nwas quite different. For example, the Indian turnip and its\r\nclose allies do not give the immediate taste or effect that\r\nfollows a similar testing of the onion or horse-radish. When\r\nthe acridity of the former is perceived the sensation is more\r\nprickling than acrid.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced is more like the pricking of numerous\r\nneedles. It is felt not only upon the tongue and palate, but\r\nwherever the part tasted comes into contact with the lips, roof\r\nof mouth or any delicate membrane. It is not perceived where\r\nthis contact does not occur.\r\n\r\nThe acridity of the onion and horse-radish is perceived at once\r\nand often affects other parts than those with which it comes\r\ninto direct contact.\r\n\r\n2. The Acrid Principle Is Not Always Volatile.--This is shown\r\nby the fact that large quantities of the mashed or finely\r\ngrated corms of the Indian turnip and allied species, produced\r\nno irritation of the eyes or nose even when these organs were\r\nbrought into close contact with the freshly pulverized\r\nmaterial. This certainly is in marked contrast with the effect\r\nproduced by freshly grated horse-radish, peeled onions, crushed\r\nmustard seed when the same test is applied.\r\n\r\nIt seems fair to assume that in the latter case some principle\r\nthat is volatile at ordinary air temperatures is present. The\r\nassumption that such principle is present in the former has no\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIn order to test this matter further a considerable quantity of\r\nthe juice of the Indian turnip was subjected to careful\r\ndistillation, with the result that no volatile principle or\r\nsubstance of any kind was found.\r\n\r\nVarious extractive processes were tried by using hot and cold\r\nwater; alcohol, chloroform, benzene, etc. These failed in every\r\ninstance to remove any substance that had a taste or effect\r\nanything like that found in the fresh Indian turnip.\r\n\r\n3. The Acrid Principle Is Not Soluble in Ether.--Inasmuch as\r\nvarious works on pharmacy made the claim that the active or\r\nacrid principle of the plants in question was soluble in ether,\r\nthis was the next subject for investigation. The juice was\r\nexpressed from a considerable quantity of the mashed Indian\r\nturnip. This juice was clear and by test was found to possess\r\nthe same acrid property as the unmashed corms.\r\n\r\nSome of the juice and an equal quantity of ether were placed\r\ninto a cylinder and well shaken. After waiting until the ether\r\nhad separated a few drops of the liquid were put into the\r\nmouth. For a little time no result was perceived, but as soon\r\nas the effect of the ether had passed away the same painful\r\nacridity was manifest as was experienced before the treatment\r\nwith the ether. A natural conclusion from this test was that\r\nthe acridity might come from some principle soluble in ether.\r\n\r\nObserving that the ether was quite turbid and wishing to learn\r\nthe cause, a drop or two was allowed to evaporate on a glass\r\nslide. Examining the residue with a microscope it was found to\r\nconsist of innumerable raphides or needle-like crystals. Some\r\nof the ether was then run through a filter. The filtrate was\r\nclear. An examination showed it to be entirely free from\r\nraphides, and it had lost every trace of its acridity. The\r\nuntreated acrid juice of the Indian turnip, calla, and other\r\nplants of the same family was then filtered and in every\r\ninstance the filtered juice was bland and had lost every trace\r\nof its acridity. These tests and others that need not be\r\nmentioned, proved conclusively that the acridity of various\r\nspecies of the Arum family was not due to a volatile principle,\r\nbut was due to the needle-shaped crystals found so abundantly\r\nin these plants.\r\n\r\nSeveral questions yet remained to be answered. (1) If these\r\nneedle-like crystals or raphides are the cause of the acridity\r\nof the plants just mentioned, why do they not produce the same\r\neffect in the fuchsia, tradescantia and other plants where they\r\nare known to be just as abundant? (2) Why does the Indian\r\nturnip lose its acridity on being heated? (3) Why does the\r\ndried Indian turnip lose its acridity?\r\n\r\nIt was first thought that the raphides found in plants having\r\nno acridity, might be of different chemical composition than\r\nthose which produce this effect.\r\n\r\nA chemical examination proved beyond question that the raphides\r\nwere of the same composition. The needle-shaped crystals in all\r\nthe plants selected for study were composed of calcium oxalate.\r\nThe crystals, found in grape, rhubarb, fuchsia and tradescantia\r\nwere identical in form, fineness and chemical composition with\r\nthose found in the plants of the Arum family. How then account\r\nfor the painfully striking effect in one case and the\r\nnon-effect in the other? This was the perplexing question.\r\n\r\nIn expressing some juice from the stems and leaves of the\r\nfuchsia and tradescantia it was found to be quite unlike that\r\nof the Indian turnip and calla. The juice of the latter was\r\nclear and limpid; that of the former quite thick and\r\nmucilaginous. There was no difference as to the abundance of\r\ncrystals revealed by the microscope.\r\n\r\nAfter diluting the ropy, mucilaginous juice with water, and\r\nshaking it thoroughly with an equal volume of ether, there was\r\nno turbidity seen in the supernatent ether. Allowing a few\r\ndrops of the ether to evaporate scarcely any crystals could be\r\nfound. Practically none of them had been removed from the\r\ninsoluble mucilaginous covering. Here and there an isolated\r\nspecimen was all that could be seen. So closely were these\r\nsmall crystals enveloped with the mucilaginous matter that it\r\nwas almost impossible to separate or dissect them from it.\r\n\r\nIt was now easy to explain why certain plants whose cells were\r\ncrowded with raphides were bland to the taste, while other\r\nplants with the same crystals were extremely acrid.\r\n\r\nIn one case the crystals were neither covered nor embedded in\r\nan insoluble mucilage, but were free to move. Thus when the\r\nplant was chewed or tasted the sharp points of these\r\nneedle-like crystals came into contact with the tongue, lips\r\nand membranous surface of the mouth.\r\n\r\nIn the other case the insoluble mucilage which surrounded the\r\ncrystals prevented all free movement and they produced no\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nWhy do these intensely acrid, aroid plants lose their acridity\r\non being heated? It is well known that the corms of the Indian\r\nturnip and its allies contain a large amount of starch. In\r\nsubjecting this starch to heat it becomes paste-like in\r\ncharacter. This starch paste acts in the same manner as the\r\ninsoluble mucilage. It prevents the free movement of the\r\ncrystals and in this way all irritant action is precluded. In\r\nheating the Indian turnip and other corms, it was found that\r\nthe heat applied must be sufficient to change the character of\r\nthe starch or the so-called acridity was not destroyed.\r\n\r\nOne other question remains to be answered. It has long been\r\nnoted that the old or thoroughly dried corms of the Indian\r\nturnip are not acrid like those that are fresh. The explanation\r\nis simple. As the plant dries or loses its moisture, the walls\r\nof the cells collapse and the crystals are closely encased in\r\nthe hard, rigid matter that surrounds them. This prevents free\r\nmovement and the crystals can not exert any irritant action.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed by biologists that the milky juice,\r\naromatic compounds, alkaloids, etc., found in plants have no\r\ndirect use in the economy of the plant. They are not connected\r\nwith the nutritive processes. They are excretions or waste\r\nproducts that the plant has little or no power to throw off.\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that these excretory\r\nsubstances often serve as a means of protection. Entomologists\r\nhave frequently stated that the milky juice and resins found in\r\nthe stems of various plants act as a protection against stem\r\nboring insects. In like manner the bulbs, stems and leaves of\r\nplants that are crowded with crystals have a greater immunity\r\nfrom injurious biting insects than plants that are free from\r\ncrystals. It is quite generally believed that the formation of\r\ncrystals is a means of eliminating injurious substances from\r\nthe living part of the plant. These substances may be regarded\r\nas remotely analogous to those organic products made by man in\r\nthe chemical laboratory.\r\n\r\nSome progress has been made in this direction, but so far the\r\nmain results are certain degradation-products such as aniline\r\ndyes derived from coal tar; salicylic acid; essences of fruits;\r\netc. Still these and many other discoveries of the same nature\r\ndo not prove that the laboratory of man can compete with the\r\nlaboratory of the living plant cell.\r\n\r\nMan has the power to break down and simplify complex substances\r\nand by so doing produce useful products that will serve his\r\npurposes. We may combine and re-combine but so far we only\r\nreplace more complex by simpler combinations.\r\n\r\nThe plant alone through its individual cells, and by its living\r\nprotoplasm has fundamentally creative power. It can build up\r\nand restore better than it can eliminate waste products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW OUR ANCESTORS WERE CURED\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR CARL HOLLIDAY\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF MONTANA\r\n\r\nSUPPOSE you had a bad case of rheumatism, and your physician\r\ncame to your bedside and exclaimed loudly, \"Hocus pocus, toutus\r\ntalonteus, vade celeriter jubeo! You are cured.\" What would you\r\nthink, what would you do, and what fee would you pay him?\r\nProbably, in spite of your aches and pangs, you would make\r\nastonishing speed--for a rheumatic person--in proffering him\r\nthe entire room to himself. But there was a time--and that as\r\nlate as Shakespeare's day--when so-called doctors in rural\r\nEngland used just such words not only for rheumatism, but for\r\nmany another disease. And to this hour the fakir on the street\r\ncorner uses that opening expression, \"Hocus pocus.\" Those words\r\nsimply prove how slowly the Christian religion was absorbed by\r\nancient Anglo-Saxon paganism; for \"Hocus pocus\" is but the\r\nhastily mumbled syllables of the Catholic priest to his early\r\nEnglish congregation--\"Hoc est corpus,\" \"this is the body\"; and\r\nthe whole expression used by the old-time doctor meant merely\r\nthat in the name of the body of Christ he commanded the disease\r\nto depart quickly.\r\n\r\nHow superstitions and ancient rites do persist. To this hour\r\nthe mountaineers of southwestern Virginia and eastern Tennessee\r\nbelieve that an iron ring on the third finger of the left hand\r\nwill drive away rheumatism, and to my personal knowledge one\r\nfairly intelligent Virginian believed this so devoutly that he\r\nactually never suffered with rheumatic pains unless he took off\r\nthe iron ring he had worn for fifteen years. It is an old, old\r\nidea--this faith in the ring-finger. The Egyptians believed\r\nthat a nerve led straight from it to the heart; the Greeks and\r\nRomans held that a blood-vessel called the \"vein of love\"\r\nconnected it closely with that organ; and the medieval\r\nalchemists always stirred their dangerous mixtures with that\r\nfinger because, in their belief, it would most quickly indicate\r\nthe presence of poison. So, too, many an ancient declared that\r\nwhenever the ring-finger of a sufferer became numb, death was\r\nnear at hand. Thus in twentieth century civilization we hear\r\nechoes of the life that Rameses knew when the Pyramids were\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nOur Anglo-Saxon forefathers had great faith in mysterious\r\nwords. The less they understood these the more they believed in\r\nthe curative power. Thus the name of foreign idols and gods\r\nbrought terror to the local demons that enter one's body, and\r\nwhen Christianity first entered England, and its meanings were\r\nbut dimly understood, the names of saints, apostles and even\r\nthe Latin and Greek forms of \"God\" and \"Jesus\" were enemies to\r\nall germs. Then, too, what comfort a jumbling of many languages\r\nbrought to the patient, especially if the polyglot cure were\r\nexpressed in rhythmic lines. Here, for instance, in at least\r\nfive languages, is a twelfth century cure for gout:\r\n\r\nMeu, treu, mor, phor,\r\nTeux, za, zor,\r\nPhe, lou, chri\r\nGe, ze, on.\r\n\r\nPerhaps to our forefathers suffering from over-indulgence in\r\nthe good things of this world, this wondrous group of sounds\r\nbrought more comfort than the nauseous drugs of the modern\r\npractitioner. Any mysterious figure or letter was exceedingly\r\nhelpful in the sick room of a thousand years ago. The Greek\r\nletters \"Alpha\" and \"Omega\" had reached England almost as soon\r\nas Christianity had, and the old-time doctor triumphantly used\r\nthem in his pow-wows. Geometric figures in a handful of sand or\r\nseeds would prophesy the fate of the ills--and do we not to\r\nthis day tell our fortune in the geometric figures made by the\r\ndregs in our tea-cups? Paternosters, snatches of Latin hymns,\r\nbits of early Church ritual were used by quacks of the olden\r\ndays for much the same reason as the geometric figures--because\r\nthey were unusual and little understood.\r\n\r\nIt would have been well had our Anglo-Saxon forefathers\r\nconfined their healing practices to such gentle homeopathic\r\nmethods as those mentioned above; but instead desperate\r\nremedies were sometimes administered by the determined\r\nmedicine-man. Diseases were supposed to be caused mainly by\r\ndemons--probably the ancestors of our present germs--and the\r\nphysician of Saxon days used all the power of flattery and\r\nthreat to induce the little monsters to come forth. When the\r\ncattle became ill, for instance, the old-time veterinarian\r\nshrieked, \"Fever, depart; 917,000 angels will pursue you!\" If\r\nthe obstinate cow refused to be cured by such a mild threat,\r\nthe demons were sometimes whipped out of her, and, if this\r\nfailed to restore her health, a hole was pierced in her left\r\near, and her back was struck with a heavy stick until the evil\r\none was compelled to flee through the hole in her ear. Nor was\r\nsuch treatment confined to cattle. The muscular doctors of a\r\nthousand years ago claimed they could cure insanity by laying\r\nit on lustily with a porpoise-skin whip, or by putting the\r\nmaniac in a closed room and smoking out the pestering fiends.\r\nOne did well to retain one's sanity in those good old days.\r\n\r\nThis use of violent words or deeds in the cure of disease is as\r\nancient almost as the race of man. The early Germans attempted\r\nto relieve sprains by reciting confidently how Baldur's horse\r\nhad been cured by Woden after all the other mighty inhabitants\r\nof Valhalla had given up the task, and even earlier tribes of\r\nEurope and Asia had used for illness such a formula as: \"The\r\ngreat mill stone that is India's is the bruiser of every worm.\r\nWith that I mash together the worms as grain with a mill\r\nstone.\" Long after Christianity had reached the Anglo- Saxons\r\nof England, the sick often hung around their necks an image of\r\nThor's hammer to frighten away the demon germs that sought to\r\ndestroy the body. This appeal to a superior being was common to\r\nall Indo-European races, and the early Christian missionaries\r\nwisely did not attempt to stamp out a belief of such antiquity,\r\nbut merely substituted the names of Christ, the Virgin Mary and\r\nthe saints for those of the heathen deities. And even into the\r\nnineteenth century this ancient form of faith cure persisted;\r\nfor there are living yet in Cornwall people who heard, as\r\nchildren, this charm for tooth-ache:\r\n\r\n Christ passed by his brother's door,\r\nSaw his brother lying on the floor;\r\nWhat aileth thee, brother!\r\nPain in the teeth.\r\nThy teeth shall pain thee no more,\r\nIn the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,\r\nI command the pain to be gone.\r\n\r\nLet us no longer boast of the carefulness of the modern\r\nphysician; the ceremonies and directions of the Anglo-Saxon\r\ndoctor were just as painstaking in minuteness and accuracy.\r\nWhen you feel the evil spirits entering you, immediately seek\r\nshelter under a linden tree; for out of linden wood were not\r\nbattle-shields made? Long before Christianity had brought its\r\ngentler touches to English life the tribal medicine man wildly\r\nbrandished such a shield, and sang defiantly to the witch\r\nmaidens or disease demons:\r\n\r\nLoud were they, lo! loud, as over the land they rode;\r\nFierce of heart were they, as over the hill they rode;\r\nShield thee now thyself, from their spite thou may'st escape\r\nthee.\r\nOut, little spear, if herein thou be!\r\nUnderneath the linden stand I, underneath the shining shield,\r\nFor the might maidens have mustered up their strength,\r\nAnd have sent their spear screaming through the air!\r\nBack again to them will I send another,\r\nArrow forth a-flying from the front against them!\r\nOut, little spear, if herein thou be!\r\n\r\nThis business of singing was very necessary in the old time\r\ndoctor's practice. Sometimes he chanted into the patient's left\r\near, sometimes into his mouth, and sometimes on some particular\r\nfinger, and the patient evidently had to get well or die to\r\nescape the persistent concerts of his physician. Not\r\ninfrequently, too, the doctor placed a cross upon the part of\r\none's anatomy to which he was giving the concert, and often the\r\neffect was increased by putting other crosses upon the four\r\nsides of the house, the fetters and bridles of the patient's\r\nhorse, and even on the foot prints of the man, or the hoof\r\nprints of the beast. Faith in the cross as a charm was\r\nunwavering; \"the cross of Christ has been hidden and is found,\"\r\ndeclared the Saxon soothsayer, and by the same token the lost\r\ncattle will soon be discovered.\r\n\r\nMany and marvelous were the methods to be followed scrupulously\r\nby the sick. Cure the stomachache by catching a beetle in both\r\nhands and throwing it over the left shoulder with both hands\r\nwithout looking backward. Have you intestinal trouble? Eat\r\nmulberries picked with the thumb and ring finger of your left\r\nhand. Do you grow old before your time? Drink water drawn\r\nsilently DOWN STREAM from a brook before daylight. Beware of\r\ndrawing it upstream; your days will be brief. It reminds one of\r\nthe practice of the modern herb doctor in peeling the bark of\r\nslippery elm DOWN, if you desire your cold to come down out of\r\nyour head, or peeling it up if you desire the cold to come up\r\nout of your chest. One not desiring to place his trust in roots\r\nand barks and herbs might turn for aid to the odd numbers, and\r\nby reciting an incantation three or seven or nine times might\r\nnot only regain health, but recover his lost possessions. Or\r\nthe sufferer might transfer his disease by pressing a bird or\r\nsmall animal to the diseased part and hastily driving the\r\ncreature away. The ever-willing and convenient family dog might\r\nbe brought into service on such an occasion by being fed a cake\r\nmade of barley meal and the sick man's saliva, or by being\r\nfastened with a string to a mandrake root, which, when thus\r\npulled from the ground, tore the demon out of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe cure of children was a comparatively easy task for the\r\nAnglo-Saxon doctor; for the only thing to be done was to have\r\nthe youngster crawl through a hole in a tree, the rim of the\r\nhole thus kindly taking to itself all the germs or demons. So,\r\ntoo, minor sores, warts and other blemishes might easily be\r\neffaced by stealing some meat, rubbing the spot with it, and\r\nburying the meat; as the meat decayed the blemish disappeared.\r\nSo to this day some Indians, and not a few Mexicans make a\r\nwaxen image of the diseased part, and place it before the fire\r\nto melt as a symbol of the gradual waning of the illness. So,\r\ntoo, the ancient Celts are said to have destroyed the life of\r\nan enemy by allowing his waxen image to melt before the fire.\r\n\r\nTo cure a dangerous disease or the illness of a full-grown man\r\nwas, however, a much more difficult matter. Inflammation, for\r\ninstance, was the work of a stubborn demon, and stubborn,\r\ntherefore, must be the strife with him. Hence, dig around a\r\nsorrel plant, sing three paternosters, pull up the plant, sing\r\n\"Sed libera nos a malo,\" pound five slices of the plant with\r\nseven pepper corns, chant the psalm \"Misere mei, Deus\" twelve\r\ntimes, sing \"Gloria in excelsis, Deo,\" recite another\r\npaternoster, at daybreak add wine to the plant and pepper\r\ncorns, face the east at mid-morning, make the sign of the\r\ncross, turn from the east to the south to the west, and then\r\ndrink the mixture. Doubtless by this time the patient had\r\nforgotten that he ever possessed inflammation.\r\n\r\nLong did the superstitions in medicine persist. In Chaucer's\r\nday, the fourteenth century, violent and poisonous drugs were\r\nused, but luckily they were often administered to a little\r\ndummy which the doctor carried about with him. As we read each\r\nday in our newspapers of the various nostrums advertised as\r\ncuring every mortal ill, we may well wonder if the average\r\ncredulity has really greatly lessened after twelve centuries of\r\nfakes and faith cures, and we almost long for the return of the\r\nday when the medicine man practiced on a dummy instead of the\r\nhuman body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMINENT AMERICAN NAMES\r\n\r\nBY LAUREN HEWITT ASHE\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH\r\n\r\nTHE article entitled \"The Racial Origin of Successful\r\nAmericans,\" by Dr. Frederick Adams Woods, which appeared in the\r\nApril (1914) issue of The Popular Science Monthly, set forth\r\nsome very interesting and instructive results. The methods used\r\nto arrive at these results, however, do not seem to be such as\r\nto establish them as final and conclusive.\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient to consider merely the number of persons\r\nbearing certain names in \"Who's Who in America,\" for the\r\npurpose of establishing the relative capability of various\r\nnationalities. The percentage of the number bearing that name\r\nin the city in question is the significant figure.\r\n\r\nThe writer has, therefore, taken the directories[1] of the four\r\nAmerican cities, which were the subjects of study in the\r\noriginal article, and has estimated the number of persons of a\r\ncertain name living in each city by first counting the number\r\nof names printed in a whole column of the directory and then\r\nmultiplying this figure by the number of columns occupied by\r\nthat name. The number of persons bearing the same name in\r\n\"Who's Who in America\" (1912-1913) is then taken for each city.\r\nThe percentage is finally calculated of the number of the\r\n\"Who's Who in America\" names in the number of those bearing\r\nthat name in the directories.\r\n\r\n[1] (1) Trow's General Directory--Boroughs of Manhattan and\r\nBronx, City of New York, 1913.

The names in\r\neach city are then arranged according to the established\r\npercentages.\r\n\r\nThe grouping of names as an indication of race or nationality\r\nis taken from Robert E. Matheson's \"Surnames in Ireland.\" It is\r\nfound to agree exactly with the grouping in the article by Dr.\r\nWoods, who classified them from the table given in the New York\r\nWorld Almanac and Encyclopedia for 1914, which table was, no\r\ndoubt, compiled from Matheson.\r\n\r\nNAMES COMMON TO ALL FOUR CITIES, NATIONALITY, ATTBIBUTED TO\r\nTHEM, AND THE PROPORTION FOR EACH NAME OF THE NUMBER OF TIMES\r\nIT OCCURS FOR EACH CITY IN \"WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA\" (1912-1913)\r\nAND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE SAME NAME IN THE SAME CITY\r\n\r\nNew York (Exclusive of Brooklyn)\r\nE    White     1.39%\r\nE    Williams  1.18\r\nE    Clark     1.05\r\nE    Taylor    1.02\r\nE    Jones     0.89\r\nE    Martin    0.87\r\nE    Smith     0.78\r\nE    Thompson  0.74\r\nE-Sc-G Miller  0.73\r\nE    Wilson    0.71\r\nE    Brown     0.70\r\nE-Sc Moore     0.60\r\nE    Davis     0.59\r\nE-Sn Johnson   0.56\r\nSc-Sn Anderson 0.55\r\nI    Murphy    0.46\r\nI    Kelly     0.37\r\nE    Klien     0.24\r\nE    Hall      0.23\r\nSc   Campbell  0.17\r\nI    O'Brien   0.14\r\nE    Lewis     0.12\r\nE-Sc Young     0.10\r\n\r\nNationality Averages\r\n\r\nG    German       0.73%\r\nE    English      0.69\r\nSn   Scandinavian 0.55\r\nSc   Scotch       0.43\r\nI    Irish        0.32\r\n\r\nChicago\r\nE    Hall      0.72\r\nE-So Moore     0.41\r\nE    Wilson    0.35\r\nE    Davis     0.27\r\nE-Sc Young     0.27\r\nE    Thompson  0.26\r\nE    Brown     0.22\r\nE    Lewis     0.20\r\nE    Taylor    0.17\r\nE-Sc-G Miller  0.17\r\nE    Martin    0.16\r\nI    Kelly     0.16\r\nE    Williams  0.15\r\nE    White     0.14\r\nE    Clark     0.14\r\nE    Smith     0.14\r\nE    Allen     0.13\r\nSc   Campbell  0.11\r\nE    Jones     0.10\r\nE-Sn Johnson   0.06\r\nI    Murphy    0.06\r\nSn-ScAnderson  0.05\r\nI    O'Brien   0.00\r\n\r\nNationality Averages\r\n\r\nE    English        0.22%\r\nSc   Scotch         0.20\r\nG    German         0.17\r\nI    Irish          0.11\r\nSn   Scandinavian   0.05\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia\r\nE    White     0.46%\r\nE    Lewis     0.32\r\nE    Taylor    0.31\r\nE    Wilson    0.30\r\nE    Jones     0.27\r\nE-Sn Johnson   0.23\r\nE    Williams  0.22\r\nE-Sc Moore     0.20\r\nE    Davis     0.18\r\nE-Sc Young     0.18\r\nE    Clark     0.14\r\nE    Smith     0.13\r\nE    Brown     0.13\r\nE-Sc-G Miller  0.12\r\nE Martin       0.08\r\nE Thompson     0.08\r\nI Murphy       0.08\r\nSc Campbell    0.08\r\nSn-Sc Anderson 0.00\r\nI    Kelly     0.00\r\nE    Allen     0.00\r\nE    Hall      0.00\r\nI    O'Brien   0.00\r\n\r\nNationality Averages\r\nE    English      0.18%\r\nSn   Scandinavian 0.16\r\nG    German       0.12\r\nSc   Scotch       0.11\r\nI    Irish        0.02\r\n\r\nBoston\r\nE    Allen     0.72\r\nE    Williams  0.67\r\nE    Brown     0.61\r\nE    Hall      0.43\r\nE    Campbell  0.33\r\nE    Clark     0.30\r\nE    Smith     0.29\r\nE    Thompson  0.28\r\nE    Taylor    0.25\r\nSn-Sc Anderson 0.22\r\nE    Lewis     0.20\r\nE-Sn Johnson   0.19\r\nE    White     0.18\r\nE-Sc Moore     0.17\r\nE    Wilson    0.13\r\nE    Jones     0.11\r\nI    O'Brien   0.08\r\nI    Murphy    0.05\r\nE    Martin    0.00\r\nE-Sc-G Miller  0.00\r\nE    Davis     0.00\r\nI    Kelly     0.00\r\nE-Sc Young     0.00\r\n\r\nNationality Averages\r\n\r\nE    English      0.25\r\nSn   Scandinavian 0.20\r\nSc   Scotch       0.14\r\nI    Irish        0.06\r\nG    German       0.0?\r\n\r\nName Averages\r\n\r\nE    Williams   0.55\r\nE    White      0.54\r\nE    Taylor     0.44\r\nE    Brown      0.41\r\nE    Clark      0.40\r\nE    Wilson     0.37\r\nE    Jones      0.34\r\nE    Thompson   0.34\r\nE-Sc Moore      0.34\r\nE    Hall       0.34\r\nE    Smith      0.33\r\nE    Martin     0.27\r\nE    Allen      0.27\r\nE    Davis      0.26\r\nE-Sn Johnson    0.26\r\nE-Sc-G Miller   0.25\r\nE    Lewis      0.21\r\nSn-Sc Anderson  0.20\r\nSc   Campbell   0.17\r\nI    Murphy     0.16\r\nE-Sc Young      0.14\r\nI    Kelly      0.13\r\nI    O'Brien    0.05\r\n\r\nNationality Averages\r\nE    English      0.34\r\nG    German       0.25\r\nSn   Scandinavian 0.24\r\nSc   Scotch       0.22\r\nI    Irish        0.12\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nationality attributed to each name is indicated in the\r\ntables below by capital letters in the parallel columns. In\r\nsome cases a name is shared by two or even three nationalities.\r\nThe percentages belonging to such names are attributed to each\r\nof the sharing nationalities in making the final averages.\r\nThis, of course, is a serious source of error, since the\r\ndivision of such names among the nationalities is not known. No\r\nstress can be laid on our figures for the German, Scotch and\r\nScandinavian nationalities, because they contain so many of\r\nthese indecisive names.\r\n\r\nThe names in each city are then arranged in groups according to\r\ntheir nationality and averages computed from the percentages\r\nestablished for each name. These averages, which appear at the\r\nbottom of each column, give a fair estimation of the capability\r\nof the different nationalities, but are, nevertheless, open to\r\na few minor errors. For instance, the Germans head the list in\r\nNew York with 0.73 per cent. for only one third of a single\r\nname, while the English rank second with a total of 15 5/6\r\nnames. The final averages for nationality, however, which\r\nappear at the bottom of the fifth column and which are made\r\nfrom the averages computed for each city, partly eliminate this\r\nerror and place the groups in their proper rank.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the results more conclusive, general averages\r\nare drawn for each name from the percentages established for\r\nthat name in all four cities and are placed in the fifth column\r\naccording to their rank. Final averages of percentages for\r\nnationalities are then made from this column, just as they were\r\nfor each city. The results obtained agree exactly with the\r\nfinal averages made before and, therefore, are placed\r\ncoincident with them at the bottom of the fifth column.\r\n\r\nThe results finally arrived at seem to corroborate the\r\nconclusions of Dr. Wood; namely, that in the four leading\r\nAmerican cities, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston,\r\n\"those of the English (and Scotch) ancestry are distinctly in\r\npossession of the leading positions, at least from the\r\nstandpoint of being widely known.\" Yet it does not seem safe to\r\ndisregard entirely those other nationalities which rank so\r\nclosely with the English merely because of the small number of\r\nthem included in our consideration; for, as has been stated\r\nabove, we do not know what proportion of a certain name to\r\nattribute to various nationalities.\r\n\r\nThere is one serious, but unavoidable, source of error,\r\nmoreover, which has apparently been overlooked. The conclusions\r\nas to the relative intelligence of various races are drawn from\r\nthe number of names, belonging to these races, which appeared\r\nin \"Who's Who in America.\" According to the standards of this\r\ncompilation, eminence is very largely dependent upon education,\r\nwhich does not give the emigrants, who are too poor to get\r\nproper education, an equal opportunity to display their\r\nintellectual power and, therefore, to be considered in the\r\nabove calculations. Races that immigrated predominantly in the\r\nlast century will be less handicapped than those which have\r\nonly recently immigrated in large numbers. It is very\r\ndifficult, however to know how much weight to place upon this\r\nmodifying influence.\r\n\r\nAnother source of error is the fact that certain nationalities\r\nor races seem to have natural inclinations and desires to\r\nfollow in disproportionate numbers one kind of activity or\r\noccupation and are content to let other people rise to those\r\npositions which make them \"the best-known men and women of the\r\nUnited States.\" As Dr. Woods states, the Jews could not be\r\nexpected to show as large a percentage, since they largely turn\r\ntheir attention to the banking, wholesale and retail trades, in\r\nwhich they have been very successful, but in which eminence is\r\nnot correspondingly recognized in \"Who's Who in America.\"\r\n\r\nNo comment is made on Jewish achievement, however, because no\r\nJewish name is among the fifty most common in all four cities,\r\nand hence there are not enough numbers for study. But the\r\nIrish, by their traditional devotion to politics and their\r\nsuccess in attaining the lower ranks of political leadership,\r\nwould seem to be in line for recognition in large numbers,\r\nwhich they nevertheless do not attain.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these qualifications, however, it becomes apparent\r\nthat the statistics above established can not be rejected.\r\nAlthough they do not exactly justify Dr. Woods's conclusions,\r\nthey at least show that the intellectual achievements of\r\ndifferent races vary. They also show that a much more extensive\r\nstudy of the subject must be made before any conclusions can be\r\nestablished as final.\r\n\r\nWe believe, therefore, that Dr. Woods's conclusion--that \"there\r\nhave been a few notable exceptions, but broadly speaking all\r\nour very capable men of the present day have been engendered\r\nfrom the Anglo-Saxon element already here before the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century\"--should be modified. A sounder\r\nconclusion and, in fact, the only one that could be reached\r\nthrough the results established above, would be this:\r\nAchievement in those activities represented in \"Who's Who in\r\nAmerica\" is acquired disproportionately by stocks predominantly\r\nTeutonic in comparison with the Irish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO OENINGEN\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR T. D. A. COCKERELL\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF COLORADO\r\n\r\nAS the Rhine broadens on its approach to the Lake of Constance\r\nor Boden Sea it flows through a region made classic by the\r\nresearches of scientific men. Here at low tide it is sometimes\r\npossible to see wooden piles which in prehistoric times\r\nsupported the houses of the lake-dwelling folk, whose work is\r\nso well represented in various museums, especially at Zurich.\r\nFrom the river, on each side, the land rises rapidly, and the\r\nrounded summits of the hills are well wooded. It is on the left\r\nside of the Rhine, about two and a half miles below the town of\r\nStein, that we come to the famous locality for Miocene fossils,\r\nthe European representative of our Florissant in Colorado.\r\n\r\nIn all the books the fossil beds are said to be at Oeningen,\r\nwhich is the name of a once celebrated Augustinian monastery\r\nabout two miles away. Actually, however, the locality is above\r\nthe village of Wangen, which is situated on the north bank of\r\nthe river. In some quite recent writings Oeningen (Wangen) is\r\nreferred to as being in Switzerland; it is in Baden, though the\r\nopposite bank of the Rhine is Swiss. The error is natural,\r\nsince the fossils have chiefly been made known by the great\r\nSwiss paleontologist Heer, of Zurich, and the best general\r\naccount of them is to be found in his book \"The Primaeval World\r\nof Switzerland,\" of which an excellent English translation\r\nappeared in 1876.\r\n\r\nIt was at the Oeningen quarries, in the eighteenth century,\r\nthat a wonderful vertebrate fossil, some four feet long, was\r\ndiscovered. A writer of that period, Scheuchzer, announced it\r\nas Homo diluvii testis, a man witness of the deluge! Cuvier\r\nknew better, and was able to demonstrate its relationship to\r\nthe giant salamanders of Eastern Asia and North America. It\r\nforms, in fact, a distinct genus of Cryptobranchidae, which\r\nTschudi, apparently mindful of the early error, named Andrias;\r\nthough the proper name of the animal appears to be\r\nProteocordylus scheuchzeri (Holl.). The stone at Wangen was\r\nused for building purposes, and at one time there were three or\r\nfour quarries actively worked. In earlier times the larger\r\nfossils naturally attracted most attention, fishes, snakes,\r\nturtles, fresh-water clams and a variety of leaves and fruits.\r\nSuch specimens were saved, and were sold and distributed to\r\nmany museums. The supply was good, yet at times not sufficient\r\nfor the market; so the monks at Oeningen, and others, would\r\ncarve artificial fossils out of the soft rock, coating them\r\nwith a brown stain prepared from unripe walnut shells. In later\r\nyears, during the middle part of the nineteenth century, the\r\nperiod of Darwin, the great importance and interest of the\r\nfossil beds came to be better appreciated. Dr. Oswald Heer,\r\nprofessor at Zurich, an accomplished botanist and entomologist,\r\ndid perhaps nine tenths of the work, describing plants,\r\ninsects, arachnids and part of the Crustacea. The fishes were\r\ndescribed by Agassiz, and later by Winkler. The remaining\r\nvertebrates were principally made known by E. von Meyer.\r\n\r\nFrom 1847 to 1853 Heer published in three parts a great work on\r\nfossil insects, largely concerned with those from Oeningen.[1]\r\nIn this and later writings he made known 464 species from this\r\nlocality; but in the latest edition of \"The Primaeval World of\r\nSwitzerland\" it is stated that there are 844 species, 384 of\r\nthese being supposedly new, and named, if at all, only in\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Die Insektenfauna der Tertiargebilde von Oeningen und von\r\nRadoboj in Croatien\" (Leipzig: Engelmann).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife and I, having worked a number of years at Florissant,\r\nwere very anxious to see the corresponding European locality\r\nfor fossil insects. The opportunity came in 1909, when we were\r\nable to make a short visit to Switzerland after attending the\r\nDarwin celebration at Cambridge. We went first to Zurich, where\r\nin a large hall in the University or Polytechnicum we saw\r\nHeer's collections. A bust of Heer stands in one corner, while\r\none end of the room is covered by a large painting by Professor\r\nHolzhalb, representing a scene at Oeningen as it may have\r\nappeared in Miocene times, showing a lake with abundant\r\nvegetation on its shores, and appropriate animals in the\r\nforeground. Numerous glass-covered cases contain the\r\nmagnificent series of fossils, both plants and animals. Dr.\r\nAlbert Heim, professor of geology and director of the\r\nGeological Museum, was most kind in showing us all we wanted to\r\nsee, and giving advice concerning the precise locality of the\r\nfossil beds. Professor Heim is an exceedingly active and able\r\ngeologist, but neither he nor any one else has continued the\r\nwork of Heer, whose collections remain apparently as he left\r\nthem. The 384 supposedly new insects are still undescribed,\r\nwith a few possible exceptions. I had time only to critically\r\nexamine the bees, of which I found three ostensibly new forms.\r\nOf these, one turned out to be a wasp,[2] one was\r\nunrecognizable, but the third was a valid new species, and was\r\npublished later in The Entomologist. There can be no doubt that\r\nHeer was too ready to distinguish species of insects in fossils\r\nwhich were so poorly preserved as to be practically worthless,\r\nconsequently part of those he published and many of those he\r\nleft unpublished will have to be rejected. Nevertheless, the\r\nOeningen materials are extremely valuable, both for the number\r\nof species and the good preservation of some of them. All\r\nshould be carefully reexamined, and the entomologist who will\r\ngive his time to this work will certainly be rewarded by many\r\ninteresting discoveries.\r\n\r\n[2] Polistes, or very closely related to that genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided with instructions from Professor Heim, we started on\r\nAugust 4 for Wangen, going by way of Constance. Thanks to the\r\nmap furnished by the Swiss railroad, we had no difficulty in\r\nfinding the Rosegarten Museum in Constance, which contains so\r\nmany interesting fossils and archeological specimens from the\r\nsurrounding region. At the moment we arrived, the old man in\r\ncharge was about to go to lunch, and we were assured that it\r\nwas impossible to get into the museum. It was then or never for\r\nus, however; and when the necessary argument had been\r\npresented, the curator not only let us in, but remained with us\r\nto point out all the objects of interest, showing a great deal\r\nof pride in the collection. The series of Oeningen fossils\r\ncould not, of course, rival that at Zurich; but it contained a\r\ngreat many remarkable things, including some excellent insects.\r\nWe then boarded the river steamer, and, passing through the\r\nUnter Sea, reached the small village of Wangen in the course of\r\nthe afternoon. This is not a tourist resort of any consequence;\r\nthe local guide book refers to it as follows: \"Wangen (with\r\nsynagogue). Half an hour to the east is the Castle of Marbach,\r\nnow a well-appointed sanatorium for disorders of the nerves and\r\nheart. To the west the romantic citadel Kattenhorn, formerly\r\nused as a rendezvous by notorious highwaymen (at present in the\r\npossession of a pensioned off German officer).\" The guide\r\ncontinues, calling our attention to \"Oberstaad. Formerly a\r\ncastle, now a weaving mill for hose. Above it (448 meters) the\r\nformer celebrated Augustine monastery Oehningen. Near by\r\ninteresting and curious STONE FOSSILS are found.\" Thus the\r\nvisitor is likely to be misled as to the whereabouts of the\r\nfossils, the tradition that they are at Oeningen having misled\r\nthe author of the guide. At Wangen we found a small but most\r\nexcellent hotel conducted by George Brauer, where we hastily\r\nsecured a room, and went out to hunt the fossil beds. We were\r\nto walk over half an hour northward, up the hill, and look for\r\nthe quarries near the top of the high terrace above the\r\nvillage. This we did, but at first without result. We passed a\r\nsmall grassy pit, where some of the rock was visible, but it\r\ndid not look at all promising. We went back and forth, and up\r\nthe hill, until we were practically on the top. The country was\r\nbeautiful, and by the roadside we found magnificent red slugs\r\n(Arion ater var. lamarckii[3]) and many fine snails, including\r\nthe so-called Roman snail, Helix pomatia. We accosted the\r\npeasants, and enquired about the \"fossilen.\" The word seemed to\r\nhave no meaning for them, so we tried to elucidate it in the\r\nmanner of the guide: where were the \"stein fossilen\"?\r\nImmediately, with animation, we were shown a road going\r\nwestward to the town of Stein, where, it was naturally assumed,\r\nthe object of our enquiry would be found. Quite discouraged, we\r\nwandered down the hill until we came to the pit we had noticed\r\nwhen going up. Close by was a neat little cottage, and it\r\noccurred to us to try our luck there as a last resort. We were\r\nglad indeed when there appeared at the door an educated man,\r\nwho in excellent Shakespearian English volunteered at once to\r\nshow us the fossil beds. It was Dr. Ernst Bacmeister, a man of\r\nconsiderable note in his own country, whose life and deeds are\r\nduly recorded in \"Wer ist's?\" He came, with his wife and child,\r\nto Wangen in the summer time, to enjoy these exquisite\r\nsurroundings, where he could write happily on philosophical\r\nsubjects, without much danger of interruption. Dr. Bacmeister\r\ninformed us that the poor little pit close by was in fact one\r\nof the noted quarries, with the sides fallen in and the debris\r\novergrown with herbage. A short distance away we were shown the\r\nothers, in the same discouraging condition.\r\n\r\n[3] The earliest name for this richly colored variety is Limax\r\ncoccineus Gistel, but it is not Limax coccineus Martyn, 1784;\r\nso the next name, lamarckii, prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne could see that there had once been considerable\r\nexcavations, but the good layers were now deeply covered by\r\ntalus, and could only be exposed after much digging. It was\r\nabout thirty years since the pits had been worked. Dr.\r\nBacmeister found for us a strong country youth, Max Deschle,\r\nwho dug under our direction all next day in the quarry near the\r\nhouse. The rock is not so easy to work as that at Florissant,\r\nand it does not split so well into slabs, but we readily found\r\na number of fossils. Most numerous were the plants; leaves of\r\ncinnamon (Cinnamomurn polymorphum), soapberry (Sapindus\r\nfalcifolius), maple (Acer trilobatum), grass (Poacites loevis)\r\nand reeds (Phragmites oeningensis), with twigs of the conifer\r\nGlyptostrobus europoeus. We obtained a single seed of the very\r\ncharacteristic Podogonium knorrii. Certain molluscs were\r\nabundant; Planorbis declivis, Lymnoea pachygaster, Pisidium\r\npriscum, with occasional fragments of the mussel Anodonta\r\nlavateri. Ostracods, Cypris faba, were also found. The best\r\nfind, however, was a well-preserved fish, the lepidocottus\r\nbrevis (Agassiz), showing in the region of the stomach its last\r\nmeal, of Planorbis declivis. This greatly interested Max, who\r\nduring the rest of the day chanted, as he swung the pick,\r\n\"Fischlein, Fischlein, komme!\"--but no other Fischlein was\r\napparently within hearing distance. Not a single insect was\r\nobtained, except that on the talus at one of the other quarries\r\nI picked up a poorly preserved beetle, apparently the Nitidula\r\nmelanaria of Heer.\r\n\r\nWe left Wangen on the morning of August 6, and proceeded up the\r\nRhine to Schaffhausen and Basle. At Basle we found a certain\r\nnumber of Oeningen (Wangen) fossils in the museum.\r\n\r\nComparing Wangen with Florissant, it appears that the Colorado\r\nlocality is more extensive, more easily worked, and provides\r\nmany more well-preserved fossils. On the other hand, Wangen has\r\nproved far richer in vertebrates and crustacea, and on the\r\nwhole gives us a better idea of the fauna as it must have\r\nexisted. Florissant far exceeds Wangen in the number of\r\ndescribed species, but this is only because it has so many more\r\ninsects. Each locality furnishes us with extraordinarily rich\r\nmaterials, enabling us to picture the life of Miocene times.\r\nEach, by comparison, throws light on the other, and while the\r\nperiod represented is not sufficiently remote to show much\r\nevidence of progressive evolution, it is hard to exaggerate the\r\nvalue of the facts for students of geographical distribution.\r\nMuch light may also be thrown on the relative stability of\r\nspecific characters.\r\n\r\nWork on the Florissant fauna is going forward, though not so\r\nfast as one could wish. It is very much to be hoped that the\r\nWangen quarries will receive attention before many years have\r\npassed. Labor is comparatively cheap in Germany, and with a\r\nforce of a dozen men it would not take long to open up the\r\nquarries and get at the best beds. It is really extraordinary\r\nthat no one has seen and taken advantage of the opportunities\r\npresented. Probably no obstacles of any consequence would be\r\nput in the way; at least the owner of the quarries came by when\r\nwe were digging, and expressed only his good will. With new\r\nresearches in the field, combined with studies of the rich\r\nmaterials awaiting examination at Zurich and elsewhere, no\r\ndoubt the knowledge we possess of the European Miocene fauna\r\ncould be very greatly increased, to the advantage of all\r\nstudents of Tertiary life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY AND PRACTISE OF FROST FIGHTING[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Some of the instruments used were obtained through a grant\r\nfrom the Elizabeth Thompson Science Fund.\r\n\r\nBY ALEXANDER McADIE\r\n\r\nBOTCH PROFESSOR OF METEOROLOGY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nONLY in recent years have aerologists given much attention to\r\nthe slow-moving currents of the lower strata of the atmosphere.\r\nThese differ greatly from the whirls and cataracts of both low\r\nand high levels which we familiarly know as the winds. The\r\nupper and larger air streams play a part in the formation of\r\nfrost, and we do not underestimate their function; but\r\nprimarily it is a slow surface flow, almost a creeping of the\r\nair near the ground, which controls the temperature and is\r\nall-important in frost formation. So important is it that the\r\nfirst law of frost fighting may be expressed as follows:\r\n\r\nWhere air is in motion and where there is good circulation,\r\nfrost is not so likely to occur as where the air is stagnant.\r\n\r\nIn other words frost in the ordinary meaning of the word is a\r\nproblem IN LOCAL AIR DRAINAGE. It is true that there are times\r\nwhen with thorough ventilation and mixing of the air strata the\r\ntemperature will fall rapidly and damage from frost result; but\r\nsuch conditions are perhaps more fittingly described as cold\r\nwaves or freezes, as distinguished from frosts. Thus, in\r\nCalifornia during the first week of January, 1913, when there\r\nwas much air movement, the citrus fruit crop was damaged to the\r\nextent of $20,000,000. The condition is generally referred to\r\nas a frost, but it was quite different from the usual frost\r\nconditions in that section. It is, however, interesting to note\r\nthat improved frost-fighting devices were used with much\r\nsuccess and the total savings aggregated about $25,000,000. The\r\norange growers also had the benefit of accurate forecasts and\r\nexpert advice and were thus able to provide fuel and labor in\r\nadvance. Passing over at present the larger disturbances, we\r\nshall consider only the frosts of still nights. And it should\r\nnot be forgotten that the accumulated losses of these frosts\r\nmay equal the losses of the individual freezes, for the latter\r\noccur at long intervals, while the quiet frosts of the early\r\nfall and the late spring are recurrent, destroying flowers,\r\nfruits and tender vegetation in many sections, year after year.\r\n\r\nAir may flow in any direction, but attention has been centered\r\nmore upon the flow in a horizontal than in a vertical\r\ndirection. Thus none of the wind instruments used at Weather\r\nBureau stations gives any record of the up and down movement of\r\nthe air. In frosts of the usual type this vertical displacement\r\nis all-important. True, there may be brought into the district,\r\nby horizontal displacement, large masses of cold air and the\r\ntemperature thus materially lowered; but the marked INVERSION\r\nof temperature occurs only when these horizontal currents or\r\nwinds are lulled. On windy nights, as is well known, there is\r\nless likelihood of frost than on quiet nights, because of the\r\nthorough mixing of the air vertically. There is then no\r\ntendency for stratification and the formation of levels of\r\ndifferent temperature, followed by low surface temperature.\r\n\r\nIn general, the temperature falls as one rises in the air; but,\r\nat times of frost, it is found that the higher levels are\r\nwarmer than the lower ones. The coldest stratum is found about\r\nten centimeters (four inches) above the ground; while at a\r\ndistance of ten meters temperatures are as much as five degrees\r\nhigher than at the ground.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to refer for a moment to the variations in\r\ntemperature known as inversions. In the accompanying diagram\r\nit will be seen that the temperature falls with elevation, and\r\nstarting from the ground on a day when the temperature is near\r\nthe freezing point, 273 degrees A., one finds at a height of\r\nseven thousand meters a fall of about forty degrees. It is not\r\neasy to represent on a single diagram the variation in detail\r\nand therefore we have divided the air column into three parts,\r\nthe scales being as one to a hundred.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand diagram shows the gradual rise in temperature\r\nfor a height of one meter and the peculiar inversion that\r\noccurs a few centimeters above the ground. Unfortunately it is\r\nin this layer where detailed temperature observations are most\r\nneeded that our instruments are least satisfactory. Ordinary\r\nthermometers can not be relied on for such small differences\r\nand the exploration of this stratum by self-recording\r\ninstruments is difficult. In the middle diagram is shown the\r\ntemperature gradient at times of frost, from the ground to a\r\nheight of one hundred meters. It will be seen that at a height\r\nof fifty meters the temperature may be ten degrees higher; and\r\nin general the rise continues with elevation. A good\r\nillustration of a valley inversion is given by the chart of May\r\n20, in which continuous records for three levels, 18, 64 and\r\n196 meters above sea level, are given. At such times fruit or\r\nflowers on hillsides escape damage from frost while in all the\r\ndepressions and low level places the injury may be marked.\r\nThese differences in temperature are not at all unusual and may\r\nbe anticipated on clear, still nights during spring, fall and\r\nwinter. Clouds or a moderate wind will prevent such an\r\ninversion. We shall refer again to this in speaking of the\r\ncranberry bogs of the Cape Cod district and the frost warnings\r\nissued from Blue Hill Observatory.\r\n\r\nThe great inversion in the atmosphere, however, is that which\r\nwe have indicated as occurring at the height of nine thousand\r\nmeters. Above this, the temperature ceases to fall and we enter\r\nwhat has been called the stratosphere or isothermal region. For\r\nconvenience we will call this upper change the MAJOR inversion\r\nand the lower one near the ground the MINOR inversion. In some\r\nways we know more about the former than the latter. Strictly\r\nspeaking, the minor inversion is the chief factor in\r\ndetermining local climate since it controls night and early\r\nmorning temperatures and in large measure the early or late\r\nblooming of flowers and ripening of fruits.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily cold air falls to the ground; but not always, for\r\nunder certain conditions cold, heavy air may actually rise,\r\ndisplacing warm, lighter air. But such conditions can be\r\nexplained and there is no contradiction of the fundamental law\r\nthat if acted on only by gravity, cold air, being denser, will\r\nsettle to the ground and warm air, being lighter, will rise.\r\nAnd there must be a certain relation between the height of the\r\nlevel from which the cold air falls and the level to which the\r\nwarm air rises. In other words, we have to apply the laws of\r\nfalling bodies since a given mass of air, although invisible,\r\nis matter and as subject to gravity as a cannon ball.\r\n\r\nOne of Galileo's most ingenious experiments consisted in\r\nswinging a pendulum and then by means of a nail driven in\r\nvarious positions intercepting the swing. He found that the bob\r\nalways rose to the same level whatever circuit it was forced to\r\ntake. But Galileo did not know what every schoolboy to-day\r\nknows, that air exerts pressure and is subject to physical\r\nprocesses like other matter, else he would certainly have given\r\nto the world a delicate air pendulum; and devised experiments\r\non the movement of air that would have opened men's eyes to the\r\nfascinating flow and counter-flow of the air, even on a\r\nseemingly still night, one favorable for the formation of\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the moving air mass, however, is more\r\ncomplicated than it looks. For with the air is mixed a quantity\r\nof water vapor. In a strict sense they are independent\r\nvariables, and the view set forth in most text-books that air\r\nhas a certain capacity for water vapor is misleading. We seldom\r\nmeet with pure, dry air. A cubic meter of such a gas mixture\r\nwould weigh 1,247 grams, at a temperature of 283 degrees A. (50\r\ndegrees F.). If chilled ten degrees, that is, to the freezing\r\npoint of water, it would weigh 46 grams more. So that by\r\ncooling, air becomes denser and heavier. A cubic meter of a\r\nmixture of air and water vapor at saturation, at the first\r\ntemperature above mentioned weighs only 1,242 grams, or five\r\ngrams less, and if this were cooled ten degrees the mixture\r\nwould weigh three grams less than the same volume of pure dry\r\nair. We see that in each case the mixture of air and water\r\nvapor weighs less than the air by itself. One would think that\r\nby adding water vapor which, while light, still has weight, the\r\ntotal weight would be the sum of both. It really is so,\r\nnotwithstanding the above figures, and the explanation of the\r\npuzzle is that there was an increase in pressure with\r\nexpansion, so that the volume of the air and saturated vapor\r\nwas greater than one cubic meter. Since then a cubic meter of\r\nair and saturated vapor weighs less than a cubic meter of dry\r\nair at freezing temperature, speaking generally, we may expect\r\nmoist air to rise and dry air to fall. Consequently, if in\r\naddition to falling temperature there is also a drying of the\r\nair, we shall have an accelerated settling or falling of cold\r\ndry air to the ground, which of course favors the formation of\r\nfrost. The water vapor plays also another role besides that of\r\nvarying the weight per unit volume. The heat received by the\r\nground consists of waves of a certain wavelength; but the heat\r\nre-radiated by the ground consists of waves of longer\r\nwave-length, and these so-called long waves (12 thousandths of\r\na millimeter) are readily absorbed by water vapor. Thus water\r\nvapor acts like a blanket and holds the heat, preventing loss\r\nof heat by radiation to space. Further on we shall speak of the\r\nhigh specific heat of both water and water vapor as compared\r\nwith air and show the bearing of this in frost fighting; but at\r\npresent we may from what precedes formulate the second law of\r\nfrost fighting as follows: \"Frost is more likely to occur where\r\nthe air is dry than where it is moist.\" It is also true that a\r\ndusty atmosphere is less favorable for frost than a dust-free\r\natmosphere. Thus we may generalize and say that whatever favors\r\nclear, still, dry air favors frost. The theory of successful\r\nfrost fighting then is to interfere with or prevent these\r\nprocesses which as we have seen facilitate cooling close to the\r\nground. In what way can this best be done?\r\n\r\nThe most natural way would be by conserving the earth's heat,\r\nwhich could be accomplished by covering plants with cloth,\r\nstraw, newspaper, or perhaps better still, modern weather-proof\r\nsheeting, or in still another way by a cover of moistened dense\r\nsmoke, generally called a smudge. A second method would be by\r\nmeans of direct application of heat; and this is accomplished\r\nin orange groves by means of improved orchard heaters. Large\r\nfires waste heat and are neither economical nor effective. A\r\nthird method would be based upon a mixing of the air strata,\r\nthus getting the benefit of the warmer higher levels. Fourth,\r\nadvantage might be taken of some agency such as water or water\r\nvapor, having a high specific heat. Finally, if the crop is of\r\na certain character such as the cranberry, it will be found\r\nadvisable to use sand, to drain and clean, here again making\r\nuse of the specific heat of some intermediary. And,\r\nfurthermore, any one of these methods may be combined with some\r\nother method.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first method, that of covers, it may be said that\r\nthe practice goes back to the early husbandmen; but only in the\r\nlast few years has the true function of the cover been properly\r\ninterpreted and we are still far from obtaining maximum\r\nefficiency. Nor is there yet a suitable, scientific cover\r\navailable. Any medium that interferes with loss of heat through\r\nfree radiation before and after sunset is a cover. The best\r\ntype of cover is a cloud; and clouds, whether high or low, are\r\ngood frost protectors. On cloudy nights there is little\r\nlikelihood of frost; and when we can bring about the formation\r\nof a layer of condensed water vapor we can practically\r\neliminate frost. We have mentioned above the fact that the\r\nearth radiates the heat it has received not in the same but in\r\nlonger wave-lengths perhaps three times as long. These are\r\neasily trapped and held by the vapor of water. Furthermore, the\r\nrate of radiation is a function of the absolute temperature and\r\nso the rapidity of loss depends somewhat upon the heat\r\nreceived. Therefore the cover should be used as early in the\r\nafternoon as possible, that is just before sunset. Aside from\r\nthe water cover or vapor cover there are cheap cloth screens,\r\nfiber screens and in some places lath screens.\r\n\r\nThe second method, that of direct heating, has met with much\r\nsuccess in the orange groves of California and elsewhere.\r\nModern heating and covering methods date from experiments begun\r\nin 1895. A number of basic patents granted to the writer in\r\nthis connection have been dedicated to the public. At the\r\npresent time there are on the market some twenty forms of\r\nheaters, which have been described with more or less detail in\r\nfarm journals and official publications. It is not necessary to\r\nrefer to them further here. The fuel originally used was wood,\r\nstraw and coal, but these are now supplanted by crude oil or\r\ndistillate. It has also been seriously proposed to use electric\r\nheaters; also to use gas in the groves. With modern orchard\r\nheaters properly installed and handled, there is no difficulty\r\nin raising the temperature of even comparatively large tracts\r\nfive degrees and maintaining a temperature above freezing, thus\r\npreventing refrigeration of plant tissue.\r\n\r\nThe third method, that of utilizing the heat of higher levels\r\nby mixing, has not yet been commercially developed; but the\r\nmethods of applying water, either in the spraying of trees or\r\nthe running of ditches or the flooding of bogs, together with\r\nmethods of sanding, cleaning; and draining, have all been\r\nproved helpful. Methods available and most effective in one\r\nsection may not necessarily be effective in another section or\r\nwith different crop requirements. Certain devices most\r\neffective in the groves of California may not answer in Florida\r\nor Louisiana because of entirely different weather conditions.\r\nIn the Gulf coast states where water is available it may be\r\nadvantageously used to hold back ripening and retard\r\ndevelopment until after the cold waves of middle and late\r\nFebruary have passed, whereas in the west coast sections\r\nconditions are very different, water having a definite value\r\nand the critical periods coming in late December or early\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nIn what precedes stress has been laid chiefly upon the fall of\r\ntemperature and the congelation of the water vapor. There is,\r\nhowever, another important matter connected with injury to\r\nplant tissue, and that is the rise in temperature AFTER the\r\nfrost. A too rapid defrosting may do considerable damage where\r\nno damage was originally done by the low temperature. It is in\r\nthis connection that water may be used to great advantage.\r\nWater, water-vapor and ice have, compared with other\r\nsubstances, remarkably high specific heats. If the specific\r\nheat under constant pressure of water be taken as unity, that\r\nof ice is 0.49; of water-vapor 0.45 and of air 0.24. Or in a\r\ngeneral way we may say that water has four times the capacity\r\nfor heat that air has. Therefore it is apparent that water will\r\nserve excellently to prevent rapid change in temperature. This\r\nis important at sunrise and shortly after when some portion of\r\nthe chilled plant tissue may be exposed to a warming sufficient\r\nto raise the temperature of the exposed portion ten degrees in\r\nan hour. The latent heat of fusion of ice is 79.6 calories and\r\nthe latent heat of vaporization of water is nearly 600 calories\r\n(a gram calorie is the amount of heat that will raise the\r\ntemperature of a gram of pure water one degree) or in exact\r\nterms from 273 degrees A. to 274 degrees A. Therefore in the\r\nprocess of changing from solid to liquid to vapor, as from ice\r\nto water to vapor, there is a large amount of heat required.\r\nThe latent heat serves to prevent fall in temperature and also\r\nserves to retard a too rapid rise. This does not mean, as is\r\ngenerally assumed, that the air will be warmed, but it does\r\nmean a retardation of temperature change. And it is essential\r\nthat the restoration of the tissues and juices to their normal\r\nstate be accomplished gradually, neither too rapidly nor yet\r\ntoo slowly.\r\n\r\nThere is probably an optimum temperature for thawing or\r\ndefrosting frozen fruits and flowers. Finally the temperature\r\nrecords as ordinarily obtained need careful interpretation. It\r\nmay be that the freezing point of liquids under pressure in the\r\nplant cells or exposed to the air through the stomata is not\r\nthe same as in the free air. It is unfortunate too that in most\r\nplaces data showing temperatures of soil, plant and air are of\r\ndoubtful character. A word of warning may be given against the\r\ntoo ready acceptance of Weather Bureau records made in cities\r\nand on the roofs of buildings. Garden and field conditions vary\r\ngreatly from these. It is further advisable to obtain a\r\ncontinuous record of the temperature of evaporation such as is\r\nshown by the records herewith. The two temperature curves made\r\nsimultaneously and easily read at any moment enable the\r\ngardener or orchardist to forecast the probable minimum\r\ntemperature of the ensuing ten or twelve hours. But not always,\r\nand some study is necessary. A slight increase in cloudiness or\r\na slight shift in wind direction will prevent the fall in\r\ntemperature which otherwise seemed probable. With a persistent\r\ninversion of temperature there is sometimes an increasing\r\nabsolute humidity.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe problem is many sided and we must consider the motion of\r\nthe air vertically as well as horizontally. Air gains and loses\r\nheat chiefly by convection, and any gain or loss by conduction\r\nmay be neglected. The plant gains heat by convection, radiation\r\nand perhaps by conduction of an internal rather than surface\r\ncharacter. The ground gains and loses heat chiefly by\r\nradiation. But the whole process is complicated and may not\r\neven be uniform. Frosts generally are preceded by a loss of\r\nheat from the lower air strata, due to convection and a\r\nhorizontal translation of the air. Then follows an equally\r\nrapid and great loss of heat by free radiation. There are minor\r\nchanges such as the setting free of heat in condensation and\r\nthe utilization in evaporation, but these latent heats are of\r\nless importance than the actual transference of the air and\r\nvapor and the removal of the latter as an absorber and retainer\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\nFrosts are recurrent phenomena reasonably certain to occur\r\nwithin given dates, and, as pointed out above, the cumulative\r\nlosses are considerable. Methods of protection to be\r\nserviceable must be available for more than one occasion, for\r\nthere is no profit in saving a crop on one night and losing it\r\non the succeeding night. But the effort is worth while.\r\nConsider that the horticulturist regularly risks the labor of\r\nmany months on the temperatures of a few hours. An efficient\r\nfrost fighting device is in a way the entering wedge for\r\nsolving problems of climate control. One may not take a crop\r\nindoors, it is true, but there is no valid reason, in the light\r\nof what has been already accomplished, why at critical periods\r\nwhich may be anticipated, the needed volume of surface air may\r\nnot be sufficiently warmed; and the losses which have\r\nheretofore been considered inevitable be prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK MEETING OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES\r\n\r\nTHE National Academy of Sciences held its annual autumn meeting\r\nduring the third week of November in the American Museum of\r\nNatural History. The central situation of New York City and its\r\nscientific attractions led to a large meeting and an excellent\r\nprogram There were present over sixty members, nearly one half\r\nof a membership widely scattered over the country. When the\r\nacademy was established in 1863 as the adviser of the\r\ngovernment in scientific questions, the membership was limited\r\nto fifty which was subsequently increased to 100, under which\r\nit was kept until recently. The present distribution of the 141\r\nmembers among different institutions in which there are more\r\nthan two is: Harvard, 19; Yale, 15; Chicago, 13; Johns Hopkins,\r\n12; Columbia, 11; U. S. Geological Survey, 8; Carnegie\r\nInstitution, 5; California, Rockefeller Institute, Smithsonian,\r\n4; Clark, Wisconsin, Cornell, Stanford, 3.\r\n\r\nThe scientific program of the meeting began with a lecture by\r\nProfessor Michael I. Pupin, of Columbia University, who\r\ndescribed the work on aerial transmission of speech of which no\r\nauthentic account has hitherto been made public. To Professor\r\nPupin we owe the discovery through mathematical analysis and\r\nexperimental work of the telephone relays which recently made\r\nspeech by wire between New York City and San Francisco\r\npossible, and we now have an authoritative account of speaking\r\nacross the land and sea a quarter way round the earth. One\r\nsession of the academy was devoted to four papers of general\r\ninterest. Professor Herbert S. Jennings, of the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, described experiments showing evolution in\r\nprogress, and Professor John M. Coulter, of the University of\r\nChicago, discussed the causes of evolution in plants Professor\r\nB. B. Boltwood made a report on the life of radium which may he\r\nregarded as a study of inorganic evolution. Professor Theodore\r\nRichards, of Harvard University, spoke of the investigations\r\nrecently conducted in the Wolcott Gibbs Memorial Laboratory.\r\nThese are in continuation of the work accomplished by Professor\r\nRichards in the determination of atomic weights, which led to\r\nthe award to him of a Nobel prize, the third to be given for\r\nscientific work done in this country, the two previous awards\r\nhaving been to Professor Michelson, of the University of\r\nChicago, in physics, and Dr. Carrel, of the Rockefeller\r\nInstitute, in physiology.\r\n\r\nOf more special papers, some of which, however, were of general\r\nand even popular interest, there were on the program 36,\r\ndistributed somewhat unequally among the sections into which\r\nthe academy is divided as follows: Mathematics, 0; Astronomy,\r\n3; Physics and Engineering, 7; Chemistry, 1; Geology and\r\nPaleontology, 6; Botany, 7; Zoology and Animal Morphology, 8;\r\nPhysiology and Pathology, 4; Anthropology and Psychology, 0. A\r\nprogram covering all the sciences belongs in a sense to the\r\neighteenth rather than to the twentieth century; still there is\r\nhuman as well as scientific interest in listening to those who\r\nare leaders in the conduct of scientific work.\r\n\r\nThe academy was fortunate in meeting in the American Museum of\r\nNatural History, where in addition to the scientific sessions\r\nluncheon and an evening reception were provided. The museum has\r\nassumed leadership both in exhibits for the public and in the\r\nscientific research which it is accomplishing. The planning of\r\nmuseum exhibits is itself a kind of research and in this\r\ndirection the American Museum, together with the National\r\nMuseum in Washington and the Field Museum in Chicago, now\r\nsurpasses any of the museums of the old world and in the course\r\nof the next ten years will have no rivals there. It is\r\ninteresting that the city and an incorporated board of trustees\r\nare able to cooperate in the support of the museum, as is also\r\nthe case with the Zoological Park and the Botanical Gardens\r\nwhich the members of the academy visited in the course of the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERIC WARD PUTNAM\r\n\r\nPOWELL in Washington, Brinton in Philadelphia and Putnam in\r\nCambridge may be regarded as the founders of modern\r\nanthropology in America. In the death of Putnam, at the age of\r\nseventy-six years, we have lost the last of these leaders.\r\n\r\nPutnam is often spoken of as the father of anthropological\r\nmuseums because he, more than any other one person, contributed\r\nto their development. He seems to have been a museum man by\r\nbirth, for at an early age we find him listed as curator of\r\nornithology in the Essex Institute of Salem, Mass. The Peabody\r\nMuseum of Archeology at Cambridge is largely his work, he\r\nhaving entered the institution in 1875 and continued as its\r\nhead until his death. This institution is in many respects one\r\nof the most typical anthropological museums in America. During\r\nhis college career Professor Putnam came under the influence of\r\nProfessor Louis Agassiz and was for several years an assistant\r\nin the laboratory of that distinguished scientist. It seems\r\nlikely that this was the source of Professor Putnam's faith and\r\nenthusiasm for the accumulation and preservation of concrete\r\ndata. As his interest in anthropology grew, he seems to have\r\nsought to bring together in the Peabody Museum a collection of\r\nscientific material that should have the same relation to the\r\nnew and developing science of anthropology as the collections\r\nof Professor Agassiz's laboratory had to the science of\r\nbiology. Professor Putnam's great skill in developing the\r\nPeabody Museum brought him into public notice and led to his\r\nappointment as director of the anthropological section of the\r\nWorld Columbian Exposition in Chicago The exhibit he prepared\r\nmade an unusual impression and it is said that largely to his\r\npersonal influence is due the interest of the late Marshall\r\nField in developing and providing for the museum which now\r\nbears his name. After this achievement Professor Putnam was\r\ninvited by the American Museum of Natural History to organize\r\nthe department of anthropology which he proceeded to do upon\r\nbroad lines, giving it a status and impetus which is still\r\nmanifest. Later on he was invited to the University of\r\nCalifornia to organize a department and a museum similar to the\r\none at Harvard and this also is now one of our leading\r\ninstitutions. Thus it is clear that the history of American\r\nanthropological museums is to a large extent the life history\r\nof Professor Putnam.\r\n\r\nThe one new and important idea which Professor Putnam brought\r\ninto his museum work was that they should be in reality\r\ninstitutions of research. Until that time they were chiefly\r\ncollections of curios brought together by purchase of\r\nmiscellaneous collections without regard to the scientific\r\nproblems involved. Professor Putnam's idea was that the museum\r\nshould go into the field and by systematic research and\r\ninvestigation develop a definite problem, bringing to the\r\nmuseum such illustrative and concrete data as should come to\r\nhand in the prosecution of research. Professor Putnam also\r\nplayed a large part in securing the recognition of anthropology\r\nby universities and by his position at Harvard pointed the way\r\nto mutual cooperation between museums and universities. He\r\npossessed an unusual personality which enabled him to approach\r\nand interest men of affairs so as to secure their financial\r\nsupport for anthropological research and as a teacher he was\r\nintensely interested in young men, offering them every possible\r\nopportunity for advancement and never really losing personal\r\ninterest in them as long as he lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC ITEMS\r\n\r\nWE record with regret the deaths of Brigadier-general George M.\r\nSternberg, retired, surgeon-general of the army, from 1893 to\r\n1902, distinguished for his investigations of yellow fever and\r\nother diseases; of Edward Lee Greene, associate in botany at\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution; of Wirt Tassin, formerly chief\r\nchemist and assistant curator of the division of mineralogy, U.\r\nS. National Museum; of Augustus Jay Du Bois, for thirty years\r\nprofessor of civil engineering in the Sheffield Scientific\r\nSchool, Yale University; of Sir Andrew Noble, F.R.S.,\r\ndistinguished for his scientific work on artillery and\r\nexplosives; of Edward A. Minchin, F.R.S., professor of\r\nprotozoology in the University of London, and of R. Assheton,\r\nF.R.S., university lecturer in animal embryology at the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Nobel prize for chemistry for 1914 has been awarded to\r\nProfessor Theodore William Richards, of Harvard University, for\r\nhis work on atomic weights. The prize for physics has been\r\nawarded to Professor Max von Laue of Frankfort-on-Main, for his\r\nwork on the diffraction of rays in crystals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR ADOLF VON BAEYER celebrated his eightieth birthday on\r\nOctober 31. With the beginning of the present semester he\r\nretired from the chair of chemistry at Munich in which he\r\nsucceeded von Liebig in 1875.--The Romanes lecture before the\r\nUniversity of Oxford will be delivered this year by Professor\r\nE. B. Poulton, Hope professor of zoology in the university, on\r\nDecember 7. The subject will be \"Science and the Great War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the recent meeting in Manchester, as we learn from Nature,\r\nthe general committee of the British Association unanimously\r\nadopted the following resolution, which has been forwarded to\r\nthe Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the\r\nPresidents of the Board of Education and of Agriculture and\r\nFisheries: \"That the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, believing that the higher education of the nation is\r\nof supreme importance in the present crisis of our history,\r\ntrusts that his Majesty's government will, by continuing its\r\nfinancial support, maintain the efficiency of teaching and\r\nresearch in the universities and university colleges of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY received by the will of Amos F. Eno the\r\nresiduary estate which may amount to several million dollars.\r\nIn addition, the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen\r\nreceives $1,800,000, and bequests of $250,000 each are made to\r\nNew York University, The American Museum of Natural History,\r\nthe Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Association for\r\nimproving the Condition of the Poor--Mr. James J. Hill has\r\npresented $125,000 to Harvard University to be added to the\r\nprincipal of the professorship in the Harvard graduate school\r\nof business administration, which bears his name. The James J.\r\nHill professorship of transportation was founded by a gift of\r\n$125,000, announced last commencement day, the donors including\r\nJohn Pierpont Morgan, Thomas W. Lamont, Robert Bacon and Howard\r\nElliott.--The sum of about $400,000 has been subscribed in the\r\nUniversity of Michigan alumni campaign for $1,000,000 with\r\nwhich to build and endow a home for the Michigan Union, as a\r\nmemorial to Dr. James B. Angell, president emeritus.",
