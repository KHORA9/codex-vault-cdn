We have indeed a\r\nwondrous story to narrate; and could we tell it adequately it would\r\nprove of boundless interest and of exquisite beauty. It leads to the\r\ncontemplation of grand phenomena in nature and great achievements of\r\nhuman genius.\r\n\r\nLet us enumerate a few of the questions which will be naturally asked by\r\none who seeks to learn something of those glorious bodies which adorn\r\nour skies: What is the Sun--how hot, how big, and how distant? Whence\r\ncomes its heat? What is the Moon? What are its landscapes like? How does\r\nour satellite move? How is it related to the earth? Are the planets\r\nglobes like that on which we live? How large are they, and how far off?\r\nWhat do we know of the satellites of Jupiter and of the rings of Saturn?\r\nHow was Uranus discovered? What was the intellectual triumph which\r\nbrought the planet Neptune to light? Then, as to the other bodies of our\r\nsystem, what are we to say of those mysterious objects, the comets? Can\r\nwe discover the laws of their seemingly capricious movements? Do we know\r\nanything of their nature and of the marvellous tails with which they are\r\noften decorated? What can be told about the shooting-stars which so\r\noften dash into our atmosphere and perish in a streak of splendour? What\r\nis the nature of those constellations of bright stars which have been\r\nrecognised from all antiquity, and of the host of smaller stars which\r\nour telescopes disclose? Can it be true that these countless orbs are\r\nreally majestic suns, sunk to an appalling depth in the abyss of\r\nunfathomable space? What have we to tell of the different varieties of\r\nstars--of coloured stars, of variable stars, of double stars, of\r\nmultiple stars, of stars that seem to move, and of stars that seem at\r\nrest? What of those glorious objects, the great star clusters? What of\r\nthe Milky Way? And, lastly, what can we learn of the marvellous nebulæ\r\nwhich our telescopes disclose, poised at an immeasurable distance? Such\r\nare a few of the questions which occur when we ponder on the mysteries\r\nof the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe history of Astronomy is, in one respect, only too like many other\r\nhistories. The earliest part of it is completely and hopelessly lost.\r\nThe stars had been studied, and some great astronomical discoveries had\r\nbeen made, untold ages before those to which our earliest historical\r\nrecords extend. For example, the observation of the apparent movement of\r\nthe sun, and the discrimination between the planets and the fixed stars,\r\nare both to be classed among the discoveries of prehistoric ages. Nor is\r\nit to be said that these achievements related to matters of an obvious\r\ncharacter. Ancient astronomy may seem very elementary to those of the\r\npresent day who have been familiar from childhood with the great truths\r\nof nature, but, in the infancy of science, the men who made such\r\ndiscoveries as we have mentioned must have been sagacious philosophers.\r\n\r\nOf all the phenomena of astronomy the first and the most obvious is that\r\nof the rising and the setting of the sun. We may assume that in the dawn\r\nof human intelligence these daily occurrences would form one of the\r\nfirst problems to engage the attention of those whose thoughts rose\r\nabove the animal anxieties of everyday existence. A sun sets and\r\ndisappears in the west. The following morning a sun rises in the east,\r\nmoves across the heavens, and it too disappears in the west; the same\r\nappearances recur every day. To us it is obvious that the sun, which\r\nappears each day, is the same sun; but this would not seem reasonable to\r\none who thought his senses showed him that the earth was a flat plain of\r\nindefinite extent, and that around the inhabited regions on all sides\r\nextended, to vast distances, either desert wastes or trackless oceans.\r\nHow could that same sun, which plunged into the ocean at a fabulous\r\ndistance in the west, reappear the next morning at an equally great\r\ndistance in the east? The old mythology asserted that after the sun had\r\ndipped in the western ocean at sunset (the Iberians, and other ancient\r\nnations, actually imagined that they could hear the hissing of the\r\nwaters when the glowing globe was plunged therein), it was seized by\r\nVulcan and placed in a golden goblet. This strange craft with its\r\nastonishing cargo navigated the ocean by a northerly course, so as to\r\nreach the east again in time for sunrise the following morning. Among\r\nthe earlier physicists of old it was believed that in some manner the\r\nsun was conveyed by night across the northern regions, and that darkness\r\nwas due to lofty mountains, which screened off the sunbeams during the\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time it was thought more rational to suppose that the\r\nsun actually pursued his course below the solid earth during the course\r\nof the night. The early astronomers had, moreover, learned to recognise\r\nthe fixed stars. It was noticed that, like the sun, many of these stars\r\nrose and set in consequence of the diurnal movement, while the moon\r\nobviously followed a similar law. Philosophers thus taught that the\r\nvarious heavenly bodies were in the habit of actually passing beneath\r\nthe solid earth.\r\n\r\nBy the acknowledgment that the whole contents of the heavens performed\r\nthese movements, an important step in comprehending the constitution of\r\nthe universe had been decidedly taken. It was clear that the earth could\r\nnot be a plane extending to an indefinitely great distance. It was also\r\nobvious that there must be a finite depth to the earth below our feet.\r\nNay, more, it became certain that whatever the shape of the earth might\r\nbe, it was at all events something detached from all other bodies, and\r\npoised without visible support in space. When this discovery was first\r\nannounced it must have appeared a very startling truth. It was so\r\ndifficult to realise that the solid earth on which we stand reposed on\r\nnothing! What was to keep it from falling? How could it be sustained\r\nwithout tangible support, like the legendary coffin of Mahomet? But\r\ndifficult as it may have been to receive this doctrine, yet its\r\nnecessary truth in due time commanded assent, and the science of\r\nAstronomy began to exist. The changes of the seasons and the recurrence\r\nof seed-time and harvest must, from the earliest times, have been\r\nassociated with certain changes in the position of the sun. In the\r\nsummer at mid-day the sun rises high in the heavens, in the winter it is\r\nalways low. Our luminary, therefore, performs an annual movement up and\r\ndown in the heavens, as well as a diurnal movement of rising and\r\nsetting. But there is a third species of change in the sun's position,\r\nwhich is not quite so obvious, though it is still capable of being\r\ndetected by a few careful observations, if combined with a philosophical\r\nhabit of reflection. The very earliest observers of the stars can hardly\r\nhave failed to notice that the constellations visible at night varied\r\nwith the season of the year. For instance, the brilliant figure of\r\nOrion, though so well seen on winter nights, is absent from the summer\r\nskies, and the place it occupied is then taken by quite different groups\r\nof stars. The same may be said of other constellations. Each season of\r\nthe year can thus be characterised by the sidereal objects that are\r\nconspicuous by night. Indeed, in ancient days, the time for commencing\r\nthe cycle of agricultural occupations was sometimes indicated by the\r\nposition of the constellations in the evening.\r\n\r\nBy reflecting on these facts the early astronomers were enabled to\r\ndemonstrate the apparent annual movement of the sun. There could be no\r\nrational explanation of the changes in the constellations with the\r\nseasons, except by supposing that the place of the sun was altering, so\r\nas to make a complete circuit of the heavens in the course of the year.\r\nThis movement of the sun is otherwise confirmed by looking at the west\r\nafter sunset, and watching the stars. As the season progresses, it may\r\nbe noticed each evening that the constellations seem to sink lower and\r\nlower towards the west, until at length they become invisible from the\r\nbrightness of the sky. The disappearance is explained by the supposition\r\nthat the sun appears to be continually ascending from the west to meet\r\nthe stars. This motion is, of course, not to be confounded with the\r\nordinary diurnal rising and setting, in which all the heavenly bodies\r\nparticipate. It is to be understood that besides being affected by the\r\ncommon motion our luminary has a slow independent movement in the\r\nopposite direction; so that though the sun and a star may set at the\r\nsame time to-day, yet since by to-morrow the sun will have moved a\r\nlittle towards the east, it follows that the star must then set a few\r\nminutes before the sun.[1]\r\n\r\nThe patient observations of the early astronomers enabled the sun's\r\ntrack through the heavens to be ascertained, and it was found that in\r\nits circuit amid the stars and constellations our luminary invariably\r\nfollowed the same path. This is called the _ecliptic_, and the\r\nconstellations through which it passes form a belt around the heavens\r\nknown as the _zodiac_. It was anciently divided into twelve equal\r\nportions or \"signs,\" so that the stages on the sun's great journey could\r\nbe conveniently indicated. The duration of the year, or the period\r\nrequired by the sun to run its course around the heavens, seems to have\r\nbeen first ascertained by astronomers whose names are unknown. The skill\r\nof the early Oriental geometers was further evidenced by their\r\ndetermination of the position of the ecliptic with regard to the\r\ncelestial equator, and by their success in the measurement of the angle\r\nbetween these two important circles on the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe principal features of the motion of the moon have also been noticed\r\nwith intelligence at an antiquity more remote than history. The\r\nattentive observer perceives the important truth that the moon does not\r\noccupy a fixed position in the heavens. During the course of a single\r\nnight the fact that the moon has moved from west to east across the\r\nheavens can be perceived by noting its position relatively to adjacent\r\nstars. It is indeed probable that the motion of the moon was a discovery\r\nprior to that of the annual motion of the sun, inasmuch as it is the\r\nimmediate consequence of a simple observation, and involves but little\r\nexercise of any intellectual power. In prehistoric times also, the time\r\nof revolution of the moon had been ascertained, and the phases of our\r\nsatellite had been correctly attributed to the varying aspect under\r\nwhich the sun-illuminated side is turned towards the earth.\r\n\r\nBut we are far from having exhausted the list of great discoveries which\r\nhave come down from unknown antiquity. Correct explanations had been\r\ngiven of the striking phenomenon of a lunar eclipse, in which the\r\nbrilliant surface is plunged temporarily into darkness, and also of the\r\nstill more imposing spectacle of a solar eclipse, in which the sun\r\nitself undergoes a partial or even a total obscuration. Then, too, the\r\nacuteness of the early astronomers had detected the five wandering stars\r\nor planets: they had traced the movements of Mercury and Venus, Mars,\r\nJupiter, and Saturn. They had observed with awe the various\r\nconfigurations of these planets: and just as the sun, and in a lesser\r\ndegree the moon, were intimately associated with the affairs of daily\r\nlife, so in the imagination of these early investigators the movements\r\nof the planets were thought to be pregnant with human weal or human woe.\r\nAt length a certain order was perceived to govern the apparently\r\ncapricious movements of the planets. It was found that they obeyed\r\ncertain laws. The cultivation of the science of geometry went hand in\r\nhand with the study of astronomy: and as we emerge from the dim\r\nprehistoric ages into the historical period, we find that the theory of\r\nthe phenomena of the heavens possessed already some degree of coherence.\r\n\r\nPtolemy, following Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, acknowledged that\r\nthe earth's figure was globular, and he demonstrated it by the same\r\narguments that we employ at the present day. He also discerned how this\r\nmighty globe was isolated in space. He admitted that the diurnal\r\nmovement of the heavens could be accounted for by the revolution of the\r\nearth upon its axis, but unfortunately he assigned reasons for the\r\ndeliberate rejection of this view. The earth, according to him, was a\r\nfixed body; it possessed neither rotation round an axis nor translation\r\nthrough space, but remained constantly at rest in what he supposed to be\r\nthe centre of the universe. According to Ptolemy's theory the sun and\r\nthe moon moved in circular orbits around the earth in the centre. The\r\nexplanation of the movements of the planets he found to be more\r\ncomplicated, because it was necessary to account for the fact that a\r\nplanet sometimes advanced and that it sometimes retrograded. The ancient\r\ngeometers refused to believe that any movement, except revolution in a\r\ncircle, was possible for a celestial body: accordingly a contrivance was\r\ndevised by which each planet was supposed to revolve in a circle, of\r\nwhich the centre described another circle around the earth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Ptolemaic doctrine is now known to be framed on quite an\r\nextravagant estimate of the importance of the earth in the scheme of the\r\nheavens, yet it must be admitted that the apparent movements of the\r\ncelestial bodies can be thus accounted for with considerable accuracy.\r\nThis theory is described in the great work known as the \"Almagest,\"\r\nwhich was written in the second century of our era, and was regarded for\r\nfourteen centuries as the final authority on all questions of astronomy.\r\n\r\nSuch was the system of Astronomy which prevailed during the Middle Ages,\r\nand was only discredited at an epoch nearly simultaneous with that of\r\nthe discovery of the New World by Columbus. The true arrangement of the\r\nsolar system was then expounded by Copernicus in the great work to which\r\nhe devoted his life. The first principle established by these labours\r\nshowed the diurnal movement of the heavens to be due to the rotation of\r\nthe earth on its axis. Copernicus pointed out the fundamental difference\r\nbetween real motions and apparent motions; he proved that the\r\nappearances presented in the daily rising and setting of the sun and the\r\nstars could be accounted for by the supposition that the earth rotated,\r\njust as satisfactorily as by the more cumbrous supposition of Ptolemy.\r\nHe showed, moreover, that the latter supposition must attribute an\r\nalmost infinite velocity to the stars, so that the rotation of the\r\nentire universe around the earth was clearly a preposterous supposition.\r\nThe second great principle, which has conferred immortal glory on\r\nCopernicus, assigned to the earth its true position in the universe.\r\nCopernicus transferred the centre, about which all the planets revolve,\r\nfrom the earth to the sun; and he established the somewhat humiliating\r\ntruth, that our earth is merely a planet pursuing a track between the\r\npaths of Venus and of Mars, and subordinated like all the other planets\r\nto the supreme sway of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThis great revolution swept from astronomy those distorted views of the\r\nearth's importance which arose, perhaps not unnaturally, from the fact\r\nthat we happen to be domiciled on that particular planet. The\r\nachievements of Copernicus were soon to be followed by the invention of\r\nthe telescope, that wonderful instrument by which the modern science of\r\nastronomy has been created. To the consideration of this important\r\nsubject we shall devote the first chapter of our book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\nA TYPICAL SUN-SPOT.\r\n\r\n(AFTER LANGLEY.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Early Astronomical Observations--The Observatory of Tycho\r\n     Brahe--The Pupil of the Eye--Vision of Faint Objects--The\r\n     Telescope--The Object-Glass--Advantages of Large Telescopes--The\r\n     Equatorial--The Observatory--The Power of a Telescope--Reflecting\r\n     Telescopes--Lord Rosse's Great Reflector at Parsonstown--How the\r\n     mighty Telescope is used--Instruments of Precision--The Meridian\r\n     Circle--The Spider Lines--Delicacy of pointing a\r\n     Telescope--Precautions necessary in making Observations--The Ideal\r\n     Instrument and the Practical One--The Elimination of\r\n     Error--Greenwich Observatory--The ordinary Opera-Glass as an\r\n     Astronomical Instrument--The Great Bear--Counting the Stars in the\r\n     Constellation--How to become an Observer.\r\n\r\nThe earliest rudiments of the Astronomical Observatory are as little\r\nknown as the earliest discoveries in astronomy itself. Probably the\r\nfirst application of instrumental observation to the heavenly bodies\r\nconsisted in the simple operation of measuring the shadow of a post cast\r\nby the sun at noonday. The variations in the length of this shadow\r\nenabled the primitive astronomers to investigate the apparent movements\r\nof the sun. But even in very early times special astronomical\r\ninstruments were employed which possessed sufficient accuracy to add to\r\nthe amount of astronomical knowledge, and displayed considerable\r\ningenuity on the part of the designers.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newcomb[2] thus writes: \"The leader was Tycho Brahe, who was\r\nborn in 1546, three years after the death of Copernicus. His attention\r\nwas first directed to the study of astronomy by an eclipse of the sun on\r\nAugust 21st, 1560, which was total in some parts of Europe. Astonished\r\nthat such a phenomenon could be predicted, he devoted himself to a study\r\nof the methods of observation and calculation by which the prediction\r\nwas made. In 1576 the King of Denmark founded the celebrated observatory\r\nof Uraniborg, at which Tycho spent twenty years assiduously engaged in\r\nobservations of the positions of the heavenly bodies with the best\r\ninstruments that could then be made. This was just before the invention\r\nof the telescope, so that the astronomer could not avail himself of that\r\npowerful instrument. Consequently, his observations were superseded by\r\nthe improved ones of the centuries following, and their celebrity and\r\nimportance are principally due to their having afforded Kepler the means\r\nof discovering his celebrated laws of planetary motion.\"\r\n\r\nThe direction of the telescope to the skies by Galileo gave a wonderful\r\nimpulse to the study of the heavenly bodies. This extraordinary man is\r\nprominent in the history of astronomy, not alone for his connection with\r\nthis supreme invention, but also for his achievements in the more\r\nabstract parts of astronomy. He was born at Pisa in 1564, and in 1609\r\nthe first telescope used for astronomical observation was constructed.\r\nGalileo died in 1642, the year in which Newton was born. It was Galileo\r\nwho laid with solidity the foundations of that science of Dynamics, of\r\nwhich astronomy is the most splendid illustration; and it was he who, by\r\npromulgating the doctrines taught by Copernicus, incurred the wrath of\r\nthe Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the human eye in so far as the exquisite adaptation of\r\nthe pupil is concerned presents us with an apt illustration of the\r\nprinciple of the telescope. To see an object, it is necessary that the\r\nlight from it should enter the eye. The portal through which the light\r\nis admitted is the pupil. In daytime, when the light is brilliant, the\r\niris decreases the size of the pupil, and thus prevents too much light\r\nfrom entering. At night, or whenever the light is scarce, the eye often\r\nrequires to grasp all it can. The pupil then expands; more and more\r\nlight is admitted according as the pupil grows larger. The illumination\r\nof the image on the retina is thus effectively controlled in accordance\r\nwith the requirements of vision.\r\n\r\nA star transmits to us its feeble rays of light, and from those rays\r\nthe image is formed. Even with the most widely-opened pupil, it may,\r\nhowever, happen that the image is not bright enough to excite the\r\nsensation of vision. Here the telescope comes to our aid: it catches all\r\nthe rays in a beam whose original dimensions were far too great to allow\r\nof its admission through the pupil. The action of the lenses\r\nconcentrates those rays into a stream slender enough to pass through the\r\nsmall opening. We thus have the brightness of the image on the retina\r\nintensified. It is illuminated with nearly as much light as would be\r\ncollected from the same object through a pupil as large as the great\r\nlenses of the telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Principle of the Refracting Telescope.]\r\n\r\nIn astronomical observatories we employ telescopes of two entirely\r\ndifferent classes. The more familiar forms are those known as\r\n_refractors_, in which the operation of condensing the rays of light is\r\nconducted by refraction. The character of the refractor is shown in Fig.\r\n1. The rays from the star fall upon the object-glass at the end of the\r\ntelescope, and on passing through they become refracted into a\r\nconverging beam, so that all intersect at the focus. Diverging from\r\nthence, the rays encounter the eye-piece, which has the effect of\r\nrestoring them to parallelism. The large cylindrical beam which poured\r\ndown on the object-glass has been thus condensed into a small one, which\r\ncan enter the pupil. It should, however, be added that the composite\r\nnature of light requires a more complex form of object-glass than the\r\nsimple lens here shown. In a refracting telescope we have to employ what\r\nis known as the achromatic combination, consisting of one lens of flint\r\nglass and one of crown glass, adjusted to suit each other with extreme\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--The Dome of the South Equatorial at Dunsink\r\nObservatory Co Dublin.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Section of the Dome of Dunsink Observatory.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of an astronomical observatory, designed to accommodate\r\nan instrument of moderate dimensions, is shown in the adjoining figures.\r\nThe first (Fig. 2) represents the dome erected at Dunsink Observatory\r\nfor the equatorial telescope, the object-glass of which was presented to\r\nthe Board of Trinity College, Dublin, by the late Sir James South. The\r\nmain part of the building is a cylindrical wall, on the top of which\r\nreposes a hemispherical roof. In this roof is a shutter, which can be\r\nopened so as to allow the telescope in the interior to obtain a view of\r\nthe heavens. The dome is capable of revolving so that the opening may be\r\nturned towards that part of the sky where the object happens to be\r\nsituated. The next view (Fig. 3) exhibits a section through the dome,\r\nshowing the machinery by which the attendant causes it to revolve, as\r\nwell as the telescope itself. The eye of the observer is placed at the\r\neye-piece, and he is represented in the act of turning a handle, which\r\nhas the power of slowly moving the telescope, in order to adjust the\r\ninstrument accurately on the celestial body which it is desired to\r\nobserve. The two lenses which together form the object-glass of this\r\ninstrument are twelve inches in diameter, and the quality of the\r\ntelescope mainly depends on the accuracy with which these lenses have\r\nbeen wrought. The eye-piece is a comparatively simple matter. It\r\nconsists merely of one or two small lenses; and various eye-pieces can\r\nbe employed, according to the magnifying power which may be desired. It\r\nis to be observed that for many purposes of astronomy high magnifying\r\npowers are not desirable. There is a limit, too, beyond which the\r\nmagnification cannot be carried with advantage. The object-glass can\r\nonly collect a certain quantity of light from the star; and if the\r\nmagnifying power be too great, this limited amount of light will be\r\nthinly dispersed over too large a surface, and the result will be found\r\nunsatisfactory. The unsteadiness of the atmosphere still further limits\r\nthe extent to which the image may be advantageously magnified, for every\r\nincrease of power increases in the same degree the atmospheric\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nA telescope mounted in the manner here shown is called an _equatorial_.\r\nThe convenience of this peculiar style of supporting the instrument\r\nconsists in the ease with which the telescope can be moved so as to\r\nfollow a star in its apparent journey across the sky. The necessary\r\nmovements of the tube are given by clockwork driven by a weight, so\r\nthat, once the instrument has been correctly pointed, the star will\r\nremain in the observer's field of view, and the effect of the apparent\r\ndiurnal movement will be neutralised. The last refinement in this\r\ndirection is the application of an electrical arrangement by which the\r\ndriving of the instrument is controlled from the standard clock of the\r\nobservatory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--The Telescope at Yerkes Observatory, Chicago.\r\n\r\n(_From the Astrophysical Journal, Vol. vi., No. 1._)]\r\n\r\nThe power of a refracting telescope--so far as the expression has any\r\ndefinite meaning--is to be measured by the diameter of its object-glass.\r\nThere has, indeed, been some honourable rivalry between the various\r\ncivilised nations as to which should possess the greatest refracting\r\ntelescope. Among the notable instruments that have been successfully\r\ncompleted is that erected in 1881 by Sir Howard Grubb, of Dublin, at the\r\nsplendid observatory at Vienna. Its dimensions may be estimated from the\r\nfact that the object-glass is two feet and three inches in diameter.\r\nMany ingenious contrivances help to lessen the inconvenience incident to\r\nthe use of an instrument possessing such vast proportions. Among them we\r\nmay here notice the method by which the graduated circles attached to\r\nthe telescope are brought within view of the observer. These circles are\r\nnecessarily situated at parts of the instrument which lie remote from\r\nthe eye-piece where the observer is stationed. The delicate marks and\r\nfigures are, however, easily read from a distance by a small auxiliary\r\ntelescope, which, by suitable reflectors, conducts the rays of light\r\nfrom the circles to the eye of the observer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Principle of Herschel's Refracting Telescope.]\r\n\r\nNumerous refracting telescopes of exquisite perfection have been\r\nproduced by Messrs. Alvan Clark, of Cambridgeport, Boston, Mass. One of\r\ntheir most famous telescopes is the great Lick Refractor now in use on\r\nMount Hamilton in California. The diameter of this object-glass is\r\nthirty-six inches, and its focal length is fifty-six feet two inches. A\r\nstill greater effort has recently been made by the same firm in the\r\nrefractor of forty inches aperture for the Yerkes Observatory of the\r\nUniversity of Chicago. The telescope, which is seventy-five feet in\r\nlength, is mounted under a revolving dome ninety feet in diameter, and\r\nin order to enable the observer to reach the eye-piece without using\r\nvery large step-ladders, the floor of the room can be raised and lowered\r\nthrough a range of twenty-two feet by electric motors. This is shown in\r\nFig. 4, while the south front of the Yerkes Observatory is represented\r\nin Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--South Front of the Yerkes Observatory, Chicago.\r\n\r\n(_From the Astrophysical Journal, Vol. vi., No. 1._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Lord Rosse's Telescope.]\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years two fine telescopes have been added to the\r\ninstrumental equipment of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, both by Sir\r\nH. Grubb. One of these, containing a 28-inch object-glass, has been\r\nerected on a mounting originally constructed for a smaller instrument by\r\nSir G. Airy. The other, presented by Sir Henry Thompson, is of 26 inches\r\naperture, and is adapted for photographic work.\r\n\r\nThere is a limit to the size of the refractor depending upon the\r\nmaterial of the object-glass. Glass manufacturers seem to experience\r\nunusual difficulties in their attempts to form large discs of optical\r\nglass pure enough and uniform enough to be suitable for telescopes.\r\nThese difficulties are enhanced with every increase in the size of the\r\ndiscs, so that the cost has a tendency to increase at a very much\r\ngreater rate. It may be mentioned in illustration that the price paid\r\nfor the object-glass of the Lick telescope exceeded ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, an alternative method of constructing a telescope, in\r\nwhich the difficulty we have just mentioned does not arise. The\r\nprinciple of the simplest form of _reflector_ is shown in Fig. 5, which\r\nrepresents what is called the Herschelian instrument. The rays of light\r\nfrom the star under observation fall on a mirror which is both carefully\r\nshaped and highly polished. After reflection, the rays proceed to a\r\nfocus, and diverging from thence, fall on the eye-piece, by which they\r\nare restored to parallelism, and thus become adapted for reception in\r\nthe eye. It was essentially on this principle (though with a secondary\r\nflat mirror at the upper end of the tube reflecting the rays at a right\r\nangle to the side of the tube, where the eye-piece is placed) that Sir\r\nIsaac Newton constructed the little reflecting telescope which is now\r\ntreasured by the Royal Society. A famous instrument of the Newtonian\r\ntype was built, half a century ago, by the late Earl of Rosse, at\r\nParsonstown. It is represented in Fig. 7. The colossal aperture of this\r\ninstrument has never been surpassed; it has, indeed, never been\r\nrivalled. The mirror or speculum, as it is often called, is a thick\r\nmetallic disc, composed of a mixture of two parts of copper with one of\r\ntin. This alloy is so hard and brittle as to make the necessary\r\nmechanical operations difficult to manage. The material admits, however,\r\nof a brilliant polish, and of receiving and retaining an accurate\r\nfigure. The Rosse speculum--six feet in diameter and three tons in\r\nweight--reposes at the lower end of a telescope fifty-five feet long.\r\nThe tube is suspended between two massive castellated walls, which form\r\nan imposing feature on the lawn at Birr Castle. This instrument cannot\r\nbe turned about towards every part of the sky, like the equatorials we\r\nhave recently been considering. The great tube is only capable of\r\nelevation in altitude along the meridian, and of a small lateral\r\nmovement east and west of the meridian. Every star or nebula visible in\r\nthe latitude of Parsonstown (except those very near the pole) can,\r\nhowever, be observed in the great telescope, if looked for at the right\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Meridian Circle.]\r\n\r\nBefore the object reaches the meridian, the telescope must be adjusted\r\nat the right elevation. The necessary power is transmitted by a chain\r\nfrom a winch at the northern end of the walls to a point near the upper\r\nend of the tube. By this contrivance the telescope can be raised or\r\nlowered, and an ingenious system of counterpoises renders the movement\r\nequally easy at all altitudes. The observer then takes his station in\r\none of the galleries which give access to the eye-piece; and when the\r\nright moment has arrived, the star enters the field of view. Powerful\r\nmechanism drives the great instrument, so as to counteract the diurnal\r\nmovement, and thus the observer can retain the object in view until he\r\nhas made his measurements or finished his drawing.\r\n\r\nOf late years reflecting telescopes have been generally made with\r\nmirrors of glass covered with a thin film of silver, which is capable of\r\nreflecting much more light than the surface of a metallic mirror. Among\r\ngreat reflectors of this kind we may mention two, of three and five feet\r\naperture respectively, with which Dr. Common has done valuable work.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, assume that for the general work in an observatory\r\na colossal instrument is the most suitable. The mighty reflector, or\r\nrefractor, is chiefly of use where unusually faint objects are being\r\nexamined. For work in which accurate measurements are made of objects\r\nnot particularly difficult to see, telescopes of smaller dimensions are\r\nmore suitable. The fundamental facts about the heavenly bodies have been\r\nchiefly learned from observations obtained with instruments of moderate\r\noptical power, specially furnished so as to enable precise measures of\r\nposition to be secured. Indeed, in the early stages of astronomy,\r\nimportant determinations of position were effected by contrivances\r\nwhich showed the direction of the object without any telescopic aid.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most valuable measurements obtained in our modern\r\nobservatories are yielded by that instrument of precision known as the\r\n_meridian circle_. It is impossible, in any adequate account of the\r\nStory of the Heavens, to avoid some reference to this indispensable aid\r\nto astronomical research, and therefore we shall give a brief account of\r\none of its simpler forms, choosing for this purpose a great instrument\r\nin the Paris Observatory, which is represented in Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nThe telescope is attached at its centre to an axis at right angles to\r\nits length. Pivots at each extremity of this axis rotate upon fixed\r\nbearings, so that the movements of the telescope are completely\r\nrestricted to the plane of the meridian. Inside the eye-piece of the\r\ntelescope extremely fine vertical fibres are stretched. The observer\r\nwatches the moon, or star, or planet enter the field of view; and he\r\nnotes by the clock the exact time, to the fraction of a second, at which\r\nthe object passes over each of the lines. A silver band on the circle\r\nattached to the axis is divided into degrees and subdivisions of a\r\ndegree, and as this circle moves with the telescope, the elevation at\r\nwhich the instrument is pointed will be indicated. For reading the\r\ndelicately engraved marks and figures on the silver, microscopes are\r\nnecessary. These are shown in the sketch, each one being fixed into an\r\naperture in the wall which supports one end of the instrument. At the\r\nopposite side is a lamp, the light from which passes through the\r\nperforated axis of the pivot, and is thence ingeniously deflected by\r\nmirrors so as to provide the requisite illumination for the lines at the\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\nThe fibres which the observer sees stretched over the field of view of\r\nthe telescope demand a few words of explanation. We require for this\r\npurpose a material which shall be very fine and fairly durable, as well\r\nas somewhat elastic, and of no appreciable weight. These conditions\r\ncannot be completely fulfilled by any metallic wire, but they are\r\nexquisitely realised in the beautiful thread which is spun by the\r\nspider. The delicate fibres are stretched with nice skill across the\r\nfield of view of the telescope, and cemented in their proper places.\r\nWith instruments so beautifully appointed we can understand the\r\nprecision attained in modern observations. The telescope is directed\r\ntowards a star, and the image of the star is a minute point of light.\r\nWhen that point coincides with the intersection of the two central\r\nspider lines the telescope is properly sighted. We use the word sighted\r\ndesignedly, because we wish to suggest a comparison between the sighting\r\nof a rifle at the target and the sighting of a telescope at a star.\r\nInstead of the ordinary large bull's-eye, suppose that the target only\r\nconsisted of a watch-dial, which, of course, the rifleman could not see\r\nat the distance of any ordinary range. But with the telescope of the\r\nmeridian circle the watch-dial would be visible even at the distance of\r\na mile. The meridian circle is indeed capable of such precision as a\r\nsighting instrument that it could be pointed separately to each of two\r\nstars which subtend at the eye an angle no greater than that subtended\r\nby an adjoining pair of the sixty minute dots around the circumference\r\nof a watch-dial a mile distant from the observer.\r\n\r\nThis power of directing the instrument so accurately would be of but\r\nlittle avail unless it were combined with arrangements by which, when\r\nonce the telescope has been pointed correctly, the position of the star\r\ncan be ascertained and recorded. One element in the determination of the\r\nposition is secured by the astronomical clock, which gives the moment\r\nwhen the object crosses the central vertical wire; the other element is\r\ngiven by the graduated circle which reads the angular distance of the\r\nstar from the zenith or point directly overhead.\r\n\r\nSuperb meridian instruments adorn our great observatories, and are\r\nnightly devoted to those measurements upon which the great truths of\r\nastronomy are mainly based. These instruments have been constructed with\r\nrefined skill; but it is the duty of the painstaking astronomer to\r\ndistrust the accuracy of his instrument in every conceivable way. The\r\ngreat tube may be as rigid a structure as mechanical engineers can\r\nproduce; the graduations on the circle may have been engraved by the\r\nmost perfect of dividing machines; but the conscientious astronomer will\r\nnot be content with mere mechanical precision. That meridian circle\r\nwhich, to the uninitiated, seems a marvellous piece of workmanship,\r\npossessing almost illimitable accuracy, is viewed in a very different\r\nlight by the astronomer who makes use of it. No one can appreciate more\r\nfully than he the skill of the artist who has made that meridian circle,\r\nand the beautiful contrivances for illumination and reading off which\r\ngive to the instrument its perfection; but while the astronomer\r\nrecognises the beauty of the actual machine he is using, he has always\r\nbefore his mind's eye an ideal instrument of absolute perfection, to\r\nwhich the actual meridian circle only makes an approximation.\r\n\r\nContrasted with the ideal instrument, the finest meridian circle is\r\nlittle more than a mass of imperfections. The ideal tube is perfectly\r\nrigid, the actual tube is flexible; the ideal divisions of the circle\r\nare perfectly uniform, the actual divisions are not uniform. The ideal\r\ninstrument is a geometrical embodiment of perfect circles, perfect\r\nstraight lines, and perfect right angles; the actual instrument can only\r\nshow approximate circles, approximate straight lines, and approximate\r\nright angles. Perhaps the spider's part of the work is on the whole the\r\nbest; the stretched web gives us the nearest mechanical approach to a\r\nperfectly straight line; but we mar the spider's work by not being able\r\nto insert those beautiful threads with perfect uniformity, while our\r\nattempts to adjust two of them across the field of view at right angles\r\ndo not succeed in producing an angle of exactly ninety degrees.\r\n\r\nNor are the difficulties encountered by the meridian observer due solely\r\nto his instrument. He has to contend against his own imperfections; he\r\nhas often to allow for personal peculiarities of an unexpected nature;\r\nthe troubles that the atmosphere can give are notorious; while the\r\nlevelling of his instrument warns him that he cannot even rely on the\r\nsolid earth itself. We learn that the earthquakes, by which the solid\r\nground is sometimes disturbed, are merely the more conspicuous\r\ninstances of incessant small movements in the earth which every night in\r\nthe year derange the delicate adjustment of the instrument.\r\n\r\nWhen the existence of these errors has been recognised, the first great\r\nstep has been taken. By an alliance between the astronomer and the\r\nmathematician it is possible to measure the discrepancies between the\r\nactual meridian circle and the instrument that is ideally perfect. Once\r\nthis has been done, we can estimate the effect which the irregularities\r\nproduce on the observations, and finally, we succeed in purging the\r\nobservations from the grosser errors by which they are contaminated. We\r\nthus obtain results which are not indeed mathematically accurate, but\r\nare nevertheless close approximations to those which would be obtained\r\nby a perfect observer using an ideal instrument of geometrical accuracy,\r\nstanding on an earth of absolute rigidity, and viewing the heavens\r\nwithout the intervention of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn addition to instruments like those already indicated, astronomers\r\nhave other means of following the motions of the heavenly bodies. Within\r\nthe last fifteen years photography has commenced to play an important\r\npart in practical astronomy. This beautiful art can be utilised for\r\nrepresenting many objects in the heavens by more faithful pictures than\r\nthe pencil of even the most skilful draughtsman can produce. Photography\r\nis also applicable for making charts of any region in the sky which it\r\nis desired to examine. When repeated pictures of the same region are\r\nmade from time to time, their comparison gives the means of ascertaining\r\nwhether any star has moved during the interval. The amount and direction\r\nof this motion may be ascertained by a delicate measuring apparatus\r\nunder which the photographic plate is placed.\r\n\r\nIf a refracting telescope is to be used for taking celestial\r\nphotographs, the lenses of the object-glass must be specially designed\r\nfor this purpose. The rays of light which imprint an image on the\r\nprepared plate are not exactly the same as those which are chiefly\r\nconcerned in the production of the image on the retina of the human eye.\r\nA reflecting mirror, however, brings all the rays, both those which are\r\nchemically active and those which are solely visual, to one and the\r\nsame focus. The same reflecting instrument may therefore be used either\r\nfor looking at the heavens or for taking pictures on a photographic\r\nplate which has been substituted for the observer's eye.\r\n\r\nA simple portrait camera has been advantageously employed for obtaining\r\nstriking photographs of larger areas of the sky than can be grasped in a\r\nlong telescope; but for purposes of accurate measurement those taken\r\nwith the latter are incomparably better.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the photographic apparatus, whatever it may\r\nbe, must be driven by delicately-adjusted clockwork to counteract the\r\napparent daily motion of the stars caused by the rotation of the earth.\r\nThe picture would otherwise be spoiled, just as a portrait is ruined if\r\nthe sitter does not remain quiet during the exposure.\r\n\r\nAmong the observatories in the United Kingdom the Royal Observatory at\r\nGreenwich is of course the most famous. It is specially remarkable among\r\nall the similar institutions in the world for the continuity of its\r\nlabours for several generations. Greenwich Observatory was founded in\r\n1675 for the promotion of astronomy and navigation, and the observations\r\nhave from the first been specially arranged with the object of\r\ndetermining with the greatest accuracy the positions of the principal\r\nfixed stars, the sun, the moon, and the planets. In recent years,\r\nhowever, great developments of the work of the Observatory have been\r\nwitnessed, and the most modern branches of the science are now\r\nassiduously pursued there.\r\n\r\nThe largest equatorial at Greenwich is a refractor of twenty-eight\r\ninches aperture and twenty-eight feet long, constructed by Sir Howard\r\nGrubb. A remarkable composite instrument from the same celebrated\r\nworkshop has also been recently added to our national institution. It\r\nconsists of a great refractor specially constructed for photography, of\r\ntwenty-six inches aperture (presented by Sir Henry Thompson) and a\r\nreflector of thirty inches diameter, which is the product of Dr.\r\nCommon's skill. The huge volume published annually bears witness to the\r\nassiduity with which the Astronomer Royal and his numerous staff of\r\nassistant astronomers make use of the splendid means at their disposal.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of the heavens, most of which cannot be seen in this\r\ncountry, is watched from various observatories in the southern\r\nhemisphere. Foremost among them is the Royal Observatory at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, which is furnished with first-class instruments. We may\r\nmention a great photographic telescope, the gift of Mr. M'Clean.\r\nAstronomy has been greatly enriched by the many researches made by Dr.\r\nGill, the director of the Cape Observatory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--The Great Bear.]\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, necessary to use such great instruments to obtain\r\nsome idea of the aid the telescope will afford. The most suitable\r\ninstrument for commencing astronomical studies is within ordinary reach.\r\nIt is the well-known binocular that a captain uses on board ship; or if\r\nthat cannot be had, then the common opera-glass will answer nearly as\r\nwell. This is, no doubt, not so powerful as a telescope, but it has some\r\ncompensating advantages. The opera-glass will enable us to survey a\r\nlarge region of the sky at one glance, while a telescope, generally\r\nspeaking, presents a much smaller field of view.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the observer is provided with an opera-glass and is\r\nabout to commence his astronomical studies. The first step is to become\r\nacquainted with the conspicuous group of seven stars represented in Fig.\r\n9. This group is often called the Plough, or Charles's Wain, but\r\nastronomers prefer to regard it as a portion of the constellation of the\r\nGreat Bear (Ursa Major). There are many features of interest in this\r\nconstellation, and the beginner should learn as soon as possible to\r\nidentify the seven stars which compose it. Of these the two marked\r\na and b, at the head of the Bear, are generally called the\r\n\"pointers.\" They are of special use, because they serve to guide the eye\r\nto that most important star in the whole sky, known as the \"pole star.\"\r\n\r\nFix the attention on that region in the Great Bear, which forms a sort\r\nof rectangle, of which the stars a b g d are the corners. The next fine\r\nnight try to count how many stars are visible within that rectangle. On\r\na very fine night, without a moon, perhaps a dozen might be perceived,\r\nor even more, according to the keenness of the eyesight. But when the\r\nopera-glass is directed to the same part of the constellation an\r\nastonishing sight is witnessed. A hundred stars can now be seen with the\r\ngreatest ease.\r\n\r\nBut the opera-glass will not show nearly all the stars in this region.\r\nAny good telescope will reveal many hundreds too faint for the feebler\r\ninstrument. The greater the telescope the more numerous the stars: so\r\nthat seen through one of the colossal instruments the number would have\r\nto be reckoned in thousands.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen the Great Bear because it is more generally known than\r\nany other constellation. But the Great Bear is not exceptionally rich in\r\nstars. To tell the number of the stars is a task which no man has\r\naccomplished; but various estimates have been made. Our great telescopes\r\ncan probably show at least 50,000,000 stars.\r\n\r\nThe student who uses a good refracting telescope, having an object-glass\r\nnot less than three inches in diameter, will find occupation for many a\r\nfine evening. It will greatly increase the interest of his work if he\r\nhave the charming handbook of the heavens known as Webb's \"Celestial\r\nObjects for Common Telescopes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The vast Size of the Sun--Hotter than Melting Platinum--Is the Sun\r\n     the Source of Heat for the Earth?--The Sun is 92,900,000 miles\r\n     distant--How to realise the magnitude of this distance--Day and\r\n     Night--Luminous and Non-Luminous Bodies--Contrast between the Sun\r\n     and the Stars--The Sun a Star--Granulated Appearance of the\r\n     Sun--The Spots on the Sun--Changes in the Form of a Spot--The\r\n     Faculæ--The Rotation of the Sun on its Axis--View of a Typical\r\n     Sun-Spot--Periodicity of the Sun-Spots--Connection between the\r\n     Sun-Spots and Terrestrial Magnetism--Principles of Spectrum\r\n     Analysis--Substances present in the Sun--Spectrum of a Spot--The\r\n     Prominences surrounding the Sun--Total Eclipse of the Sun--Size and\r\n     Movement of the Prominences--Their connection with the\r\n     Spots--Spectroscopic Measurement of Motion on the Sun--The Corona\r\n     surrounding the Sun--Constitution of the Sun.\r\n\r\nIn commencing our examination of the orbs which surround us, we\r\nnaturally begin with our peerless sun. His splendid brilliance gives him\r\nthe pre-eminence over all other celestial bodies.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of our luminary are commensurate with his importance.\r\nAstronomers have succeeded in the difficult task of ascertaining the\r\nexact figures, but they are so gigantic that the results are hard to\r\nrealise. The diameter of the orb of day, or the length of the axis,\r\npassing through the centre from one side to the other, is 866,000 miles.\r\nYet this bare statement of the dimensions of the great globe fails to\r\nconvey an adequate idea of its vastness. If a railway were laid round\r\nthe sun, and if we were to start in an express train moving sixty miles\r\nan hour, we should have to travel for five years without intermission\r\nnight or day before we had accomplished the journey.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun is compared with the earth the bulk of our luminary becomes\r\nstill more striking. Suppose his globe were cut up into one million\r\nparts, each of these parts would appreciably exceed the bulk of our\r\nearth. Fig. 10 exhibits a large circle and a very small one, marked S\r\nand E respectively. These circles show the comparative sizes of the two\r\nbodies. The mass of the sun does not, however, exceed that of the earth\r\nin the same proportion. Were the sun placed in one pan of a mighty\r\nweighing balance, and were 300,000 bodies as heavy as our earth placed\r\nin the other, the luminary would turn the scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Comparative Size of the Earth and the Sun.]\r\n\r\nThe sun has a temperature far surpassing any that we artificially\r\nproduce, either in our chemical laboratories or our metallurgical\r\nestablishments. We can send a galvanic current through a piece of\r\nplatinum wire. The wire first becomes red hot, then white hot; then it\r\nglows with a brilliance almost dazzling until it fuses and breaks. The\r\ntemperature of the melting platinum wire could hardly be surpassed in\r\nthe most elaborate furnaces, but it does not attain the temperature of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be admitted that there is an apparent discrepancy\r\nbetween a fact of common experience and the statement that the sun\r\npossesses the extremely high temperature that we have just tried to\r\nillustrate. \"If the sun were hot,\" it has been said, \"then the nearer we\r\napproach to him the hotter we should feel; yet this does not seem to be\r\nthe case. On the top of a high mountain we are nearer to the sun, and\r\nyet everybody knows that it is much colder up there than in the valley\r\nbeneath. If the mountain be as high as Mont Blanc, then we are certainly\r\ntwo or three miles nearer the glowing globe than we were at the\r\nsea-level; yet, instead of additional warmth, we find eternal snow.\" A\r\nsimple illustration may help to lessen this difficulty. In a greenhouse\r\non a sunshiny day the temperature is much hotter than it is outside. The\r\nglass will permit the hot sunbeams to enter, but it refuses to allow\r\nthem out again with equal freedom, and consequently the temperature\r\nrises. The earth may, from this point of view, be likened to a\r\ngreenhouse, only, instead of the panes of glass, our globe is enveloped\r\nby an enormous coating of air. On the earth's surface, we stand, as it\r\nwere, inside the greenhouse, and we benefit by the interposition of the\r\natmosphere; but when we climb very high mountains, we gradually pass\r\nthrough some of the protecting medium, and then we suffer from the cold.\r\nIf the earth were deprived of its coat of air, it seems certain that\r\neternal frost would reign over whole continents as well as on the tops\r\nof the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe actual distance of the sun from the earth is about 92,900,000 miles;\r\nbut by merely reciting the figures we do not receive a vivid impression\r\nof the real magnitude. It would be necessary to count as quickly as\r\npossible for three days and three nights before one million was\r\ncompleted; yet this would have to be repeated nearly ninety-three times\r\nbefore we had counted all the miles between the earth and the sun.\r\n\r\nEvery clear night we see a vast host of stars scattered over the sky.\r\nSome are bright, some are faint, some are grouped into remarkable forms.\r\nWith regard to this multitude of brilliant points we have now to ask an\r\nimportant question. Are they bodies which shine by their own light like\r\nthe sun, or do they only shine with borrowed light like the moon? The\r\nanswer is easily stated. Most of those bodies shine by their own light,\r\nand they are properly called _stars_.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the sun and the multitude of stars, properly so called, are\r\neach and all self-luminous brilliant bodies, what is the great\r\ndistinction between the sun and the stars? There is, of course, a vast\r\nand obvious difference between the unrivalled splendour of the sun and\r\nthe feeble twinkle of the stars. Yet this distinction does not\r\nnecessarily indicate that our luminary has an intrinsic splendour\r\nsuperior to that of the stars. The fact is that we are nestled up\r\ncomparatively close to the sun for the benefit of his warmth and light,\r\nwhile we are separated from even the nearest of the stars by a mighty\r\nabyss. If the sun were gradually to retreat from the earth, his light\r\nwould decrease, so that when he had penetrated the depths of space to a\r\ndistance comparable with that by which we are separated from the stars,\r\nhis glory would have utterly departed. No longer would the sun seem to\r\nbe the majestic orb with which we are familiar. No longer would he be a\r\nsource of genial heat, or a luminary to dispel the darkness of night.\r\nOur great sun would have shrunk to the insignificance of a star, not so\r\nbright as many of those which we see every night.\r\n\r\nMomentous indeed is the conclusion to which we are now led. That myriad\r\nhost of stars which studs our sky every night has been elevated into\r\nvast importance. Each one of those stars is itself a mighty sun,\r\nactually rivalling, and in many cases surpassing, the splendour of our\r\nown luminary. We thus open up a majestic conception of the vast\r\ndimensions of space, and of the dignity and splendour of the myriad\r\nglobes by which that space is tenanted.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect of the picture not without its utility. We must\r\nfrom henceforth remember that our sun is only a star, and not a\r\nparticularly important star. If the sun and the earth, and all which it\r\ncontains, were to vanish, the effect in the universe would merely be\r\nthat a tiny star had ceased its twinkling. Viewed simply as a star, the\r\nsun must retire to a position of insignificance in the mighty fabric of\r\nthe universe. But it is not as a star that we have to deal with the sun.\r\nTo us his comparative proximity gives him an importance incalculably\r\ntranscending that of all the other stars. We imagined ourselves to be\r\nwithdrawn from the sun to obtain his true perspective in the universe;\r\nlet us now draw near, and give him that attention which his supreme\r\nimportance to us merits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--The Sun, photographed on September 22, 1870.]\r\n\r\nTo the unaided eye the sun appears to be a flat circle. If, however, it\r\nbe examined with the telescope, taking care of course to interpose a\r\npiece of dark-coloured glass, or to employ some similar precaution to\r\nscreen the eye from injury, it will then be perceived that the sun is\r\nnot a flat surface, but a veritable glowing globe.\r\n\r\nThe first question which we must attempt to answer enquires whether the\r\nglowing matter which forms the globe is a solid mass, or, if not solid,\r\nwhich is it, liquid or gaseous? At the first glance we might think that\r\nthe sun cannot be fluid, and we might naturally imagine that it was a\r\nsolid ball of some white-hot substance. But this view is not correct;\r\nfor we can show that the sun is certainly not a solid body in so far at\r\nleast as its superficial parts are concerned.\r\n\r\nA general view of the sun as shown by a telescope of moderate dimensions\r\nmay be seen in Fig. 11, which is taken from a photograph obtained by Mr.\r\nRutherford at New York on the 22nd of September, 1870. It is at once\r\nseen that the surface of the luminary is by no means of uniform texture\r\nor brightness. It may rather be described as granulated or mottled. This\r\nappearance is due to the luminous clouds which float suspended in a\r\nsomewhat less luminous layer of gas. It is needless to say that these\r\nsolar clouds are very different from the clouds which we know so well in\r\nour own atmosphere. Terrestrial clouds are, of course, formed from\r\nminute drops of water, while the clouds at the surface of the sun are\r\ncomposed of drops of one or more chemical elements at an exceedingly\r\nhigh temperature.\r\n\r\nThe granulated appearance of the solar surface is beautifully shown in\r\nthe remarkable photographs on a large scale which M. Janssen, of Meudon,\r\nhas succeeded in obtaining during the last twenty years. We are enabled\r\nto reproduce one of them in Fig. 12. It will be observed that the\r\ninterstices between the luminous dots are of a greyish tint, the general\r\neffect (as remarked by Professor Young) being much like that of rough\r\ndrawing paper seen from a little distance. We often notice places over\r\nthe surface of such a plate where the definition seems to be\r\nunsatisfactory. These are not, however, the blemishes that might at\r\nfirst be supposed. They arise neither from casual imperfections of the\r\nphotographic plate nor from accidents during the development; they\r\nplainly owe their origin to some veritable cause in the sun itself, nor\r\nshall we find it hard to explain what that cause must be. As we shall\r\nhave occasion to mention further on, the velocities with which the\r\nglowing gases on the sun are animated must be exceedingly great. Even in\r\nthe hundredth part of a second (which is about the duration of the\r\nexposure of this plate) the movements of the solar clouds are\r\nsufficiently great to produce the observed indistinctness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Photograph of the Solar Surface. (_By\r\nJanssen._)]\r\n\r\nIrregularly dispersed over the solar surface small dark objects called\r\nsun-spots are generally visible. These spots vary greatly both as to\r\nsize and as to number. Sun-spots were first noticed in the beginning of\r\nthe seventeenth century, shortly after the invention of the telescope.\r\nTheir general appearance is shown in Fig. 13, in which the dark central\r\nnucleus appears in sharp contrast with the lighter margin or penumbra.\r\nFig. 16 shows a small spot developing out of one of the pores or\r\ninterstices between the granules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--An Ordinary Sun-spot.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest observers of these spots had remarked that they seem to\r\nhave a common motion across the sun. In Fig. 14 we give a copy of a\r\nremarkable drawing by Father Scheiner, showing the motion of two spots\r\nobserved by him in March, 1627. The figure indicates the successive\r\npositions assumed by the spots on the several days from the 2nd to the\r\n16th March. Those marks which are merely given in outline represent the\r\nassumed positions on the 11th and the 13th, on which days it happened\r\nthat the weather was cloudy, so that no observations could be made. It\r\nis invariably found that these objects move in the same\r\ndirection--namely, from the eastern to the western limb[3] of the sun.\r\nThey complete the journey across the face of the sun in twelve or\r\nthirteen days, after which they remain invisible for about the same\r\nlength of time until they reappear at the eastern limb. These early\r\nobservers were quick to discern the true import of their discovery. They\r\ndeduced from these simple observations the remarkable fact that the sun,\r\nlike the earth, performs a rotation on its axis, and in the same\r\ndirection. But there is the important difference between these rotations\r\nthat whereas the earth takes only twenty-four hours to turn once round,\r\nthe solar globe takes about twenty-six days to complete one of its much\r\nmore deliberate rotations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nSPOTS AND FACULÆ ON THE SUN.\r\n\r\n(FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY MR. WARREN DE LA RUE, 20TH SEPT., 1861.)]\r\n\r\nIf we examine sun-spots under favourable atmospheric conditions and\r\nwith a telescope of fairly large aperture, we perceive a great amount of\r\ninteresting detail which is full of information with regard to the\r\nstructure of the sun. The penumbra of a spot is often found to be made\r\nup of filaments directed towards the middle of the spot, and generally\r\nbrighter at their inner ends, where they adjoin the nucleus. In a\r\nregularly formed spot the outline of the penumbra is of the same general\r\nform as that of the nucleus, but astronomers are frequently deeply\r\ninterested by witnessing vast spots of very irregular figure. In such\r\ncases the bright surface-covering of the sun (the photosphere, as it is\r\ncalled) often encroaches on the nucleus and forms a peninsula stretching\r\nout into, or even bridging across, the gloomy interior. This is well\r\nshown in Professor Langley's fine drawing (Plate II.) of a very\r\nirregular spot which he observed on December 23-24, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe details of a spot vary continually; changes may often be noticed\r\neven from day to day, sometimes from hour to hour. A similar remark may\r\nbe made with respect to the bright streaks or patches which are\r\nfrequently to be observed especially in the neighbourhood of spots.\r\nThese bright marks are known by the name of _faculæ_ (little torches).\r\nThey are most distinctly seen near the margin of the sun, where the\r\nlight from its surface is not so bright as it is nearer to the centre of\r\nthe disc. The reduction of light at the margin is due to the greater\r\nthickness of absorbing atmosphere round the sun, through which the light\r\nemitted from the regions near the margin has to pass in starting on its\r\nway towards us.\r\n\r\nNone of the markings on the solar disc constitute permanent features on\r\nthe sun. Some of these objects may no doubt last for weeks. It has,\r\nindeed, occasionally happened that the same spot has marked the solar\r\nglobe for many months; but after an existence of greater or less\r\nduration those on one part of the sun may disappear, while as frequently\r\nfresh marks of the same kind become visible in other places. The\r\ninference from these various facts is irresistible. They tell us that\r\nthe visible surface of the sun is not a solid mass, is not even a liquid\r\nmass, but that the globe, so far as we can see it, consists of matter in\r\nthe gaseous, or vaporous, condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Scheiner's Observations on Sun-spots.]\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a large spot divides into two or more separate\r\nportions, and these have been sometimes seen to fly apart with a\r\nvelocity in some cases not less than a thousand miles an hour. \"At\r\ntimes, though very rarely\" (I quote here Professor Young,[4] to whom I\r\nam frequently indebted), \"a different phenomenon of the most surprising\r\nand startling character appears in connection with these objects:\r\npatches of intense brightness suddenly break out, remaining visible for\r\na few minutes, moving, while they last, with velocities as great as one\r\nhundred miles _a second_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Zones on the Sun's Surface in which Spots\r\nappear.]\r\n\r\n\"One of these events has become classical. It occurred on the forenoon\r\n(Greenwich time) of September 1st, 1859, and was independently witnessed\r\nby two well-known and reliable observers--Mr. Carrington and Mr.\r\nHodgson--whose accounts of the matter may be found in the Monthly\r\nNotices of the Royal Astronomical Society for November, 1859. Mr.\r\nCarrington at the time was making his usual daily observations upon the\r\nposition, configuration, and size of the spots by means of an image of\r\nthe solar disc upon a screen--being then engaged upon that eight years'\r\nseries of observations which lie at the foundation of so much of our\r\npresent solar science. Mr. Hodgson, at a distance of many miles, was at\r\nthe same time sketching details of sun-spot structure by means of a\r\nsolar eye-piece and shade-glass. They simultaneously saw two luminous\r\nobjects, shaped something like two new moons, each about eight thousand\r\nmiles in length and two thousand wide, at a distance of some twelve\r\nthousand miles from each other. These burst suddenly into sight at the\r\nedge of a great sun-spot with a dazzling brightness at least five or six\r\ntimes that of the neighbouring portions of the photosphere, and moved\r\neastward over the spot in parallel lines, growing smaller and fainter,\r\nuntil in about five minutes they disappeared, after traversing a course\r\nof nearly thirty-six thousand miles.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun-spots do not occur at all parts of the sun's surface\r\nindifferently. They are mainly found in two zones (Fig. 15) on each side\r\nof the solar equator between the latitudes of 10° and 30°. On the\r\nequator the spots are rare except, curiously enough, near the time when\r\nthere are few spots elsewhere. In high latitudes they are never seen.\r\nClosely connected with these peculiar principles of their distribution\r\nis the remarkable fact that spots in different latitudes do not indicate\r\nthe same values for the period of rotation of the sun. By watching a\r\nspot near the sun's equator Carrington found that it completed a\r\nrevolution in twenty-five days and two hours. At a latitude of 20° the\r\nperiod is about twenty-five days and eighteen hours, at 30° it is no\r\nless than twenty-six days and twelve hours, while the comparatively few\r\nspots observed in the latitude of 45° require twenty-seven and a half\r\ndays to complete their circuit.\r\n\r\nAs the sun, so far at least as its outer regions are concerned, is a\r\nmass of gas and not a solid body, there would be nothing incredible in\r\nthe supposition that spots are occasionally endowed with movements of\r\ntheir own like ships on the ocean. It seems, however, from the facts\r\nbefore us that the different zones on the sun, corresponding to what we\r\ncall the torrid and temperate zones on the earth, persist in rotating\r\nwith velocities which gradually decrease from the equator towards the\r\npoles. It seems probable that the interior parts of the sun do not\r\nrotate as if the whole were a rigidly connected mass. The mass of the\r\nsun, or at all events its greater part, is quite unlike a rigid body,\r\nand the several portions are thus to some extent free for independent\r\nmotion. Though we cannot actually see how the interior parts of the sun\r\nrotate, yet here the laws of dynamics enable us to infer that the\r\ninterior layers of the sun rotate more rapidly than the outer layers,\r\nand thus some of the features of the spot movements can be accounted\r\nfor. But at present it must be confessed that there are great\r\ndifficulties in the way of accounting for the distribution of spots and\r\nthe law of rotation of the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1826 Schwabe, a German astronomer, commenced to keep a\r\nregular register of the number of spots visible on the sun. After\r\nwatching them for seventeen years he was able to announce that the\r\nnumber of spots seemed to fluctuate from year to year, and that there\r\nwas a period of about ten years in their changes. Subsequent\r\nobservations have confirmed this discovery, and old books and\r\nmanuscripts have been thoroughly searched for information of early\r\ndate. Thus a more or less complete record of the state of the sun as\r\nregards spots since the beginning of the seventeenth century has been\r\nput together. This has enabled astronomers to fix the period of the\r\nrecurring maximum with greater accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe course of one of the sun-spot cycles may be described as follows:\r\nFor two or three years the spots are both larger and more numerous than\r\non the average; then they begin to diminish, until in about six or seven\r\nyears from the maximum they decline to a minimum; the number of the\r\nspots then begins to increase, and in about four and a half years the\r\nmaximum is once more attained. The length of the cycle is, on an\r\naverage, about eleven years and five weeks, but both its length and the\r\nintensity of the maxima vary somewhat. For instance, a great maximum\r\noccurred in the summer of 1870, after which a very low minimum occurred\r\nin 1879, followed by a feeble maximum at the end of 1883; next came an\r\naverage minimum about August, 1889, followed by the last observed\r\nmaximum in January, 1894. It is not unlikely that a second period of\r\nabout sixty or eighty years affects the regularity of the eleven-year\r\nperiod. Systematic observations carried on through a great many years to\r\ncome will be required to settle this question, as the observations of\r\nsun-spots previous to 1826 are far too incomplete to decide the issues\r\nwhich arise.\r\n\r\nA curious connection seems to exist between the periodicity of the spots\r\nand their distribution over the surface of the sun. When a minimum is\r\nabout to pass away the spots generally begin to show themselves in\r\nlatitudes about 30° north and south of the sun's equator; they then\r\ngradually break out somewhat nearer to the equator, so that at the time\r\nof maximum frequency most of them appear at latitudes not greater than\r\n16°. This distance from the sun's equator goes on decreasing till the\r\ntime of minimum. Indeed, the spots linger on very close to the equator\r\nfor a couple of years more, until the outbreak signalising the\r\ncommencement of another period has commenced in higher latitudes.\r\n\r\nWe have still to note an extraordinary feature which points to an\r\nintimate connection between the phenomena of sun-spots and the purely\r\nterrestrial phenomena of magnetism. It is of course well known that the\r\nneedle of a compass does not point exactly to the north, but diverges\r\nfrom the meridian by an angle which is different in different places and\r\nis not even constant at the same place. For instance, at Greenwich the\r\nneedle at present points in a direction 17° West of North, but this\r\namount is subject to very slow and gradual changes, as well as to very\r\nsmall daily oscillations. It was found about fifty years ago by Lamont\r\n(a Bavarian astronomer, but a native of Scotland) that the extent of\r\nthis daily oscillation increases and decreases regularly in a period\r\nwhich he gave as 10-1/3 years, but which was subsequently found to be\r\n11-1/10 years, exactly the same as the period of the spots on the sun.\r\nFrom a diligent study of the records of magnetic observations it has\r\nbeen found that the time of sun-spot maximum always coincides almost\r\nexactly with that of maximum daily oscillation of the compass needle,\r\nwhile the minima agree similarly. This close relationship between the\r\nperiodicity of sun-spots and the daily movements of the magnetic needle\r\nis not the sole proof we possess that there is a connection of some sort\r\nbetween solar phenomena and terrestrial magnetism. A time of maximum\r\nsun-spots is a time of great magnetic activity, and there have even been\r\nspecial cases in which a peculiar outbreak on the sun has been\r\nassociated with remarkable magnetic phenomena on the earth. A very\r\ninteresting instance of this kind is recorded by Professor Young, who,\r\nwhen observing at Sherman on the 3rd August, 1872, perceived a very\r\nviolent disturbance of the sun's surface. He was told the same day by a\r\nmember of his party, who was engaged in magnetic observations and who\r\nwas quite in ignorance of what Professor Young had seen, that he had\r\nbeen obliged to desist from his magnetic work in consequence of the\r\nviolent motion of his magnet. It was afterwards found from the\r\nphotographic records at Greenwich and Stonyhurst that the magnetic\r\n\"storm\" observed in America had simultaneously been felt in England. A\r\nsimilar connection between sun-spots and the aurora borealis has also\r\nbeen noticed, this fact being a natural consequence of the well-known\r\nconnection between the aurora and magnetic disturbances. On the other\r\nhand, it must be confessed that many striking magnetic storms have\r\noccurred without any corresponding solar disturbance,[5] but even those\r\nwho are inclined to be sceptical as to the connection between these two\r\nclasses of phenomena in particular cases can hardly doubt the remarkable\r\nparallelism between the general rise and fall in the number of sun-spots\r\nand the extent of the daily movements of the compass needle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--The Texture of the Sun and a small Spot.]\r\n\r\nWe have now described the principal solar phenomena with which the\r\ntelescope has made us acquainted. But there are many questions connected\r\nwith the nature of the sun which not even the most powerful telescope\r\nwould enable us to solve, but which the spectroscope has given us the\r\nmeans of investigating.\r\n\r\nWhat we receive from the sun is warmth and light. The intensely heated\r\nmass of the sun radiates forth its beams in all directions with\r\nboundless prodigality. Each beam we feel to be warm, and we see to be\r\nbrilliantly white, but a more subtle analysis than mere feeling or mere\r\nvision is required. Each sunbeam bears marks of its origin. These marks\r\nare not visible until a special process has been applied, but then the\r\nsunbeam can be made to tell its story, and it will disclose to us much\r\nof the nature of the constitution of the great luminary.\r\n\r\nWe regard the sun's light as colourless, just as we speak of water as\r\ntasteless, but both of those expressions relate rather to our own\r\nfeelings than to anything really characteristic of water or of sunlight.\r\nWe regard the sunlight as colourless because it forms, as it were, the\r\nbackground on which all other colours are depicted. The fact is, that\r\nwhite is so far from being colourless that it contains every known hue\r\nblended together in certain proportions. The sun's light is really\r\nextremely composite; Nature herself tells us this if we will but give\r\nher the slightest attention. Whence come the beautiful hues with which\r\nwe are all familiar? Look at the lovely tints of a garden; the red of\r\nthe rose is not in the rose itself. All the rose does is to grasp the\r\nsunbeams which fall upon it, extract from these beams the red which they\r\ncontain, and radiate that red light to our eyes. Were there not red rays\r\nconveyed with the other rays in the sunbeam, there could be no red rose\r\nto be seen by sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe principle here involved has many other applications; a lady will\r\noften say that a dress which looks very well in the daylight does not\r\nanswer in the evening. The reason is that the dress is intended to show\r\ncertain colours which exist in the sunlight; but these colours are not\r\ncontained to the same degree in gaslight, and consequently the dress has\r\na different hue. The fault is not in the dress, the fault lies in the\r\ngas; and when the electric light is used it sends forth beams more\r\nnearly resembling those from the sun, and the colours of the dress\r\nappear with all their intended beauty.\r\n\r\nThe most glorious natural indication of the nature of the sunlight is\r\nseen in the rainbow. Here the sunbeams are refracted and reflected from\r\ntiny globes of water in the clouds; these convey to us the sunlight, and\r\nin doing so decompose the white beams into the seven primary hues--red,\r\norange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE A.\r\n\r\nTHE SUN.\r\n\r\n_Royal Observatory, Greenwich, July 8, 1892._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--The Prism.]\r\n\r\nThe bow set in the cloud is typical of that great department of modern\r\nscience of which we shall now set forth the principles. The globes of\r\nwater decompose the solar beams; and we follow the course suggested by\r\nthe rainbow, and analyse the sunlight into its constituents. We are\r\nenabled to do this with scientific accuracy when we employ that\r\nremarkable key to Nature's secrets known as the spectroscope. The beams\r\nof white sunlight consist of innumerable beams of every hue in intimate\r\nassociation. Every shade of red, of yellow, of blue, and of green, can\r\nbe found in a sunbeam. The magician's wand, with which we strike the\r\nsunbeam and sort the tangled skein into perfect order, is the simple\r\ninstrument known as the glass prism. We have represented this instrument\r\nin its simplest form in the adjoining figure (Fig. 17). It is a piece of\r\npure and homogeneous glass in the shape of a wedge. When a ray of light\r\nfrom the sun or from any source falls upon the prism, it passes through\r\nthe transparent glass and emerges on the other side; a remarkable change\r\nis, however, impressed on the ray by the influence of the glass. It is\r\nbent by refraction from the path it originally pursued, and is compelled\r\nto follow a different path. If, however, the prism bent all rays of\r\nlight equally, then it would be of no service in the analysis of light;\r\nbut it fortunately happens that the prism acts with varying efficiency\r\non the rays of different hues. A red ray is not refracted so much as a\r\nyellow ray; a yellow ray is not refracted so much as a blue one. It\r\nconsequently happens that when the composite beam of sunlight, in which\r\nall the different rays are blended, passes through the prism, they\r\nemerge in the manner shown in the annexed figure (Fig. 18). Here then we\r\nhave the source of the analysing power of the prism; it bends the\r\ndifferent hues unequally and consequently the beam of composite\r\nsunlight, after passing through the prism, no longer shows mere white\r\nlight, but is expanded into a coloured band of light, with hues like the\r\nrainbow, passing from deep red at one end through every intermediate\r\ngrade to the violet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Dispersion of Light by the Prism.]\r\n\r\nWe have in the prism the means of decomposing the light from the sun, or\r\nthe light from any other source, into its component parts. The\r\nexamination of the quality of the light when analysed enables us to\r\nlearn something of the constitution of the body from which this light\r\nhas emanated. Indeed, in some simple cases the mere colour of a light\r\nwill be sufficient to indicate the source from which it has come. There\r\nis, for instance, a splendid red light sometimes seen in displays of\r\nfireworks, due to the metal strontium. The eye can identify the element\r\nby the mere colour of the flame. There is also a characteristic yellow\r\nlight produced by the flame of common salt burned with spirits of wine.\r\nSodium is the important constituent of salt, so here we recognise\r\nanother substance merely by the colour it emits when burning. We may\r\nalso mention a third substance, magnesium, which burns with a brilliant\r\nwhite light, eminently characteristic of the metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\nSPECTRA OF THE SUN AND STARS.\r\n\r\nI. SUN.\r\nII. SIRIUS.\r\nIII. ALDEBARAN.\r\nIV. BETELGEUZE.]\r\n\r\nThe three metals, strontium, sodium, and magnesium, may thus be\r\nidentified by the colours they produce when incandescent. In this simple\r\nobservation lies the germ of the modern method of research known as\r\nspectrum analysis. We may now examine with the prism the colours of the\r\nsun and the colours of the stars, and from this examination we can learn\r\nsomething of the materials which enter into their composition. We are\r\nnot restricted to the use of merely a single prism, but we may arrange\r\nthat the light which it is desired to analyse shall pass through several\r\nprisms in succession in order to increase the _dispersion_ or the\r\nspreading out of the different colours. To enter the spectroscope the\r\nlight first passes through a narrow slit, and the rays are then rendered\r\nparallel by passing through a lens; these parallel rays next pass\r\nthrough one or more prisms, and are finally viewed through a small\r\ntelescope, or they may be intercepted by a photographic plate on which a\r\npicture will then be made. If the beam of light passing through the slit\r\nhas radiated from an incandescent solid or liquid body, or from a gas\r\nunder high pressure, the coloured band or _spectrum_ is found to contain\r\nall the colours indicated on Plate XIII., without any interruption\r\nbetween the colours. This is known as a continuous spectrum. But if we\r\nexamine light from a gas under low pressure, as can be done by placing a\r\nsmall quantity of the gas in a glass tube and making it glow by an\r\nelectric current, we find that it does not emit rays of all colours, but\r\nonly rays of certain distinct colours which are different for different\r\ngases. The spectrum of a gas, therefore, consists of a number of\r\ndetached luminous lines.\r\n\r\nWhen we study the sunlight through the prism, it is found that the\r\nspectrum does not extend quite continuously from one end to the other,\r\nbut is shaded over by a multitude of dark lines, only a few of which are\r\nshown in the adjoining plate. (Plate XIII.) These lines are a permanent\r\nfeature in the solar spectrum. They are as characteristic of the\r\nsunlight as the prismatic colours themselves, and are full of interest\r\nand information with regard to the sun. These lines are the characters\r\nin which the history and the nature of the sun are written. Viewed\r\nthrough an instrument of adequate power, dark lines are to be found\r\ncrossing the solar spectrum in hundreds and in thousands. They are of\r\nevery variety of strength and faintness; their distribution seems guided\r\nby no simple law. At some parts of the spectrum there are but few lines;\r\nin other regions they are crowded so closely together that it is\r\ndifficult to separate them. They are in some places exquisitely fine and\r\ndelicate, and they never fail to excite the admiration of every one who\r\nlooks at this interesting spectacle in a good instrument.\r\n\r\nThere can be no better method of expounding the rather difficult subject\r\nof spectrum analysis than by actually following the steps of the\r\noriginal discovery which first gave a clear demonstration of the\r\nsignificance of the dark \"Fraunhofer\" lines. Let us concentrate our\r\nattention specially upon that line of the solar spectrum marked D. This,\r\nwhen seen in the spectroscope, is found to consist of two lines, very\r\ndelicately separated by a minute interval, one of these lines being\r\nslightly thicker than the other. Suppose that while the attention is\r\nconcentrated on these lines the flame of an ordinary spirit-lamp\r\ncoloured by common salt be held in front of the instrument, so that the\r\nray of direct solar light passes through the flame before entering the\r\nspectroscope. The observer sees at once the two lines known as D flash\r\nout with a greatly increased blackness and vividness, while there is no\r\nother perceptible effect on the spectrum. A few trials show that this\r\nintensification of the D lines is due to the vapour of sodium arising\r\nfrom the salt burning in the lamp through which the sunlight has passed.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible that this marvellous connection between sodium\r\nand the D lines of the spectrum can be merely casual. Even if there were\r\nonly a single line concerned, it would be in the highest degree unlikely\r\nthat the coincidence should arise by accident; but when we find the\r\nsodium affecting both of the two close lines which form D, our\r\nconviction that there must be some profound connection between these\r\nlines and sodium rises to absolute certainty. Suppose that the sunlight\r\nbe cut off, and that all other light is excluded save that emanating\r\nfrom the glowing vapour of sodium in the spirit flame. We shall then\r\nfind, on looking through the spectroscope, that we no longer obtain all\r\nthe colours of the rainbow; the light from the sodium is concentrated\r\ninto two bright yellow lines, filling precisely the position which the\r\ndark D lines occupied in the solar spectrum, and the darkness of which\r\nthe sodium flame seemed to intensify.\r\n\r\nWe must here endeavour to remove what may at first sight appear to be a\r\nparadox. How is it, that though the sodium flame produces two _bright_\r\nlines when viewed in the absence of other light, yet it actually appears\r\nto intensify the two _dark_ lines in the sun's spectrum? The explanation\r\nof this leads us at once to the cardinal doctrine of spectrum analysis.\r\nThe so-called dark lines in the solar spectrum are only dark _by\r\ncontrast_ with the brilliant illumination of the rest of the spectrum. A\r\ngood deal of solar light really lies in the dark lines, though not\r\nenough to be seen when the eye is dazzled by the brilliancy around. When\r\nthe flame of the spirit-lamp charged with sodium intervenes, it sends\r\nout a certain amount of light, which is entirely localised in these two\r\nlines. So far it would seem that the influence of the sodium flame ought\r\nto be manifested in diminishing the darkness of the lines and rendering\r\nthem less conspicuous. As a matter of fact, they are far more\r\nconspicuous with the sodium flame than without it. This arises from the\r\nfact that the sodium flame possesses the remarkable property of cutting\r\noff the sunlight which was on its way to those particular lines; so\r\nthat, though the sodium contributes some light to the lines, yet it\r\nintercepts a far greater quantity of the light that would otherwise have\r\nilluminated those lines, and hence they became darker with the sodium\r\nflame than without it.\r\n\r\nWe are thus conducted to a remarkable principle, which has led to the\r\ninterpretation of the dark lines in the spectrum of the sun. We find\r\nthat when the sodium vapour is heated, it gives out light of a very\r\nparticular type, which, viewed through the prism, is concentrated in two\r\nlines. But the sodium vapour possesses also this property, that light\r\nfrom the sun can pass through it without any perceptible absorption,\r\nexcept of those particular rays which are of the same characters as the\r\ntwo lines in question. In other words, we say that if the heated vapour\r\nof a substance gives a spectrum of bright lines, corresponding to lights\r\nof various kinds, this same vapour will act as an opaque screen to\r\nlights of those special kinds, while remaining transparent to light of\r\nevery other description.\r\n\r\nThis principle is of such importance in the theory of spectrum analysis\r\nthat we add a further example. Let us take the element iron, which in a\r\nvery striking degree illustrates the law in question. In the solar\r\nspectrum some hundreds of the dark lines are known to correspond with\r\nthe spectrum of iron. This correspondence is exhibited in a vivid manner\r\nwhen, by a suitable contrivance, the light of an electric spark from\r\npoles of iron is examined in the spectroscope side by side with the\r\nsolar spectrum. The iron lines in the sun are identical in position with\r\nthe lines in the spectrum of glowing iron vapour. But the spectrum of\r\niron, as here described, consists of bright lines; while those with\r\nwhich it is compared in the sun are dark on a bright background. They\r\ncan be completely understood if we suppose the vapour arising from\r\nintensely heated iron to be present in the atmosphere which surrounds\r\nthe luminous strata on the sun. This vapour would absorb or stop\r\nprecisely the same rays as it emits when incandescent, and hence we\r\nlearn the important fact that iron, no less than sodium, must, in one\r\nform or another, be a constituent of the sun.\r\n\r\nSuch is, in brief outline, the celebrated discovery of modern times\r\nwhich has given an interpretation to the dark lines of the solar\r\nspectrum. The spectra of a large number of terrestrial substances have\r\nbeen examined in comparison with the solar spectrum, and thus it has\r\nbeen established that many of the elements known on the earth are\r\npresent in the sun. We may mention calcium, iron, hydrogen, sodium,\r\ncarbon, nickel, magnesium, cobalt, aluminium, chromium, strontium,\r\nmanganese, copper, zinc, cadmium, silver, tin, lead, potassium. Some of\r\nthe elements which are of the greatest importance on the earth would\r\nappear to be missing from the sun. Sulphur, phosphorus, mercury, gold,\r\nnitrogen may be mentioned among the elements which have hitherto given\r\nno indication of their being solar constituents.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that the lines of a substance in the sun's\r\natmosphere may be so very bright that the light of the continuous\r\nspectrum, on which they are superposed, is not able to \"reverse\"\r\nthem--_i.e._ turn them into dark lines. We know, for instance, that the\r\nbright lines of sodium vapour may be made so intensely bright that the\r\nspectrum of an incandescent lime-cylinder placed behind the sodium\r\nvapour does not reverse these lines. If, then, we make the sodium lines\r\nfainter, they may be reduced to exactly the intensity prevailing in that\r\npart of the spectrum of the lime-light, in which case the lines, of\r\ncourse, could not be distinguished. The question as to what elements are\r\nreally missing from the sun must therefore, like many other questions\r\nconcerning our great luminary, at present be considered an open one. We\r\nshall shortly see that an element previously unknown has actually been\r\ndiscovered by means of a line representing it in the solar spectrum.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the sun-spots and see what the spectroscope can\r\nteach us as to their nature. We attach a powerful spectroscope to the\r\neye-end of a telescope in order to get as much light as possible\r\nconcentrated on the slit; the latter has therefore to be placed exactly\r\nat the focus of the object-glass. The instrument is then pointed to a\r\nspot, so that its image falls on the slit, and the presence of the dark\r\ncentral part called the _umbra_ reveals itself by a darkish stripe which\r\ntraverses the ordinary sun-spectrum from end to end. It is bordered on\r\nboth sides by the spectrum of the _penumbra_, which is much brighter\r\nthan that of the umbra, but fainter than that of the adjoining regions\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the spectrum is darkened we learn that there is\r\nconsiderable general absorption of light in the umbra. This absorption\r\nis not, however, such as would be caused by the presence of volumes of\r\nminute solid or liquid particles like those which constitute smoke or\r\ncloud. This is indicated by the fact, first discovered by Young in\r\n1883, that the spectrum is not uniformly darkened as it would be if the\r\nabsorption were caused by floating particles. In the course of\r\nexamination of many large and quiescent spots, he perceived that the\r\nmiddle green part of the spectrum was crossed by countless fine, dark\r\nlines, generally touching each other, but here and there separated by\r\nbright intervals. Each line is thicker in the middle (corresponding to\r\nthe centre of the spot) and tapers to a fine thread at each end; indeed,\r\nmost of these lines can be traced across the spectrum of the penumbra\r\nand out on to that of the solar surface. The absorption would therefore\r\nseem to be caused by gases at a much lower temperature than that of the\r\ngases present outside the spot.\r\n\r\nIn the red and yellow parts of the spot-spectrum, which have been\r\nspecially studied for many years by Sir Norman Lockyer at the South\r\nKensington Observatory, interesting details are found which confirm this\r\nconclusion. Many of the dark lines are not thicker and darker in the\r\nspot than they are in the ordinary sun-spectrum, while others are very\r\nmuch thickened in the spot-spectrum, such as the lines of iron, calcium,\r\nand sodium. The sodium lines are sometimes both widened and doubly\r\nreversed--that is, on the thick dark line a bright line is superposed.\r\nThe same peculiarity is not seldom seen in the notable calcium lines H\r\nand K at the violet end of the spectrum. These facts indicate the\r\npresence of great masses of the vapours of sodium and calcium over the\r\nnucleus. The observations at South Kensington have also brought to light\r\nanother interesting peculiarity of the spot-spectra. At the time of\r\nminimum frequency of spots the lines of iron and other terrestrial\r\nelements are prominent among the most widened lines; at the maxima these\r\nalmost vanish, and the widening is found only amongst lines of unknown\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope has given us the means of studying other interesting\r\nfeatures on the sun, which are so faint that in the full blaze of\r\nsunlight they cannot be readily observed with a mere telescope. We can,\r\nhowever, see them easily enough when the brilliant body of the sun is\r\nobscured during the rare occurrence of a total eclipse. The conditions\r\nnecessary for the occurrence of an eclipse will be more fully\r\nconsidered in the next chapter. For the present it will be sufficient to\r\nobserve that by the movement of the moon it may so happen that the moon\r\ncompletely hides the sun, and thus for certain parts of the earth\r\nproduces what we call a total eclipse. The few minutes during which a\r\ntotal eclipse lasts are of much interest to the astronomer. Darkness\r\nreigns over the landscape, and in that darkness rare and beautiful\r\nsights are witnessed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Prominences seen in Total Eclipse.]\r\n\r\nWe have in Fig. 19 a diagram of a total eclipse, showing some of the\r\nremarkable objects known as prominences (_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_) which\r\nproject from behind the dark body of the moon. That they do not belong\r\nto the moon, but are solar appendages of some sort, is easily\r\ndemonstrated. They first appear on the eastern limb at the commencement\r\nof totality. Those first seen are gradually more or less covered by the\r\nadvancing moon, while others peep out behind the western limb of the\r\nmoon, until totality is over and the sunlight bursts out again, when\r\nthey all instantly vanish.\r\n\r\nThe first total eclipse which occurred after the spectroscope had been\r\nplaced in the hands of astronomers was in 1868. On the 18th August in\r\nthat year a total eclipse was visible in India. Several observers, armed\r\nwith spectroscopes, were on the look-out for the prominences, and were\r\nable to announce that their spectrum consisted of detached bright lines,\r\nthus demonstrating that these objects were masses of glowing gas. On the\r\nfollowing day the illustrious astronomer, Janssen, one of the observers\r\nof the eclipse, succeeded in seeing the lines in full sunlight, as he\r\nnow knew exactly where to look for them. Many months before the eclipse\r\nSir Norman Lockyer had been preparing to search for the prominences, as\r\nhe expected them to yield a line spectrum which would be readily\r\nvisible, if only the sun's ordinary light could be sufficiently winnowed\r\naway. He proposed to effect this by using a spectroscope of great\r\ndispersion, which would spread out the continuous spectrum considerably\r\nand make it fainter. The effect of the great dispersion on the isolated\r\nbright lines he expected to see would be only to widen the intervals\r\nbetween them without interfering with their brightness. The new\r\nspectroscope, which he ordered to be constructed for this purpose, was\r\nnot completed until some weeks after the eclipse was over, though before\r\nthe news of Janssen's achievement reached Europe from India. When that\r\nnews did arrive Sir N. Lockyer had already found the spectrum of unseen\r\nprominences at the sun's limb. The honour of the practical application\r\nof a method of observing solar prominences without the help of an\r\neclipse must therefore be shared between the two astronomers.\r\n\r\nWhen a spectroscope is pointed to the margin of the sun so that the slit\r\nis radial, certain short luminous lines become visible which lie exactly\r\nin the prolongation of the corresponding dark lines in the solar\r\nspectrum. From due consideration of the circumstances it can be shown\r\nthat the gases which form the prominences are also present as a\r\ncomparatively shallow atmospheric layer all round the great luminary.\r\nThis layer is about five or six thousand miles deep, and is situated\r\nimmediately above the dense layer of luminous clouds which forms the\r\nvisible surface of the sun and which we call the photosphere. The\r\ngaseous envelope from which the prominences spring has been called the\r\nchromosphere on account of the coloured lines displayed in its spectrum.\r\nSuch lines are very numerous, but those pertaining to the single\r\nsubstance, hydrogen, predominate so greatly that we may say the\r\nchromosphere consists chiefly of this element. It is, however, to be\r\nnoted that calcium and one other element are also invariably present,\r\nwhile iron, manganese and magnesium are often apparent. The remarkable\r\nelement, of which we have not yet mentioned the name, has had an\r\nastonishing history.\r\n\r\nDuring the eclipse of 1868 a fine yellow line was noticed among the\r\nlines of the prominence spectrum, and it was not unnaturally at first\r\nassumed that it must be the yellow sodium line. But when careful\r\nobservations were afterwards made without hurry in full sunshine, and\r\naccurate measures were obtained, it was at once remarked that this line\r\nwas not identical with either of the components of the double sodium\r\nline. The new line was, no doubt, quite close to the sodium lines, but\r\nslightly towards the green part of the spectrum. It was also noticed\r\nthere was not generally any corresponding line to be seen among the dark\r\nlines in the ordinary solar spectrum, though a fine dark one has now and\r\nthen been detected, especially near a sun-spot. Sir Norman Lockyer and\r\nSir Edward Frankland showed that this was not produced by any known\r\nterrestrial element. It was, therefore, supposed to be caused by some\r\nhitherto unknown body to which the name of _helium_, or the sun element,\r\nwas given. About a dozen less conspicuous lines were gradually\r\nidentified in the spectrum of the prominences and the chromosphere,\r\nwhich appeared also to be caused by this same mysterious helium. These\r\nsame remarkable lines have in more recent years also been detected in\r\nthe spectra of various stars.\r\n\r\nThis gas so long known in the heavens was at last detected on earth. In\r\nApril, 1895, Professor Ramsay, who with Lord Rayleigh had discovered the\r\nnew element argon, detected the presence of the famous helium line in\r\nthe spectrum of the gas liberated by heating the rare mineral known as\r\ncleveite, found in Norway. Thus this element, the existence of which had\r\nfirst been detected on the sun, ninety-three million miles away, has at\r\nlast been proved to be a terrestrial element also.\r\n\r\nWhen it was announced by Runge that the principal line in the spectrum\r\nof the terrestrial helium had a faint and very close companion line on\r\nthe red-ward side, some doubt seemed at first to be cast on the identity\r\nof the new terrestrial gas discovered by Ramsay with the helium of the\r\nchromosphere. The helium line of the latter had never been noticed to be\r\ndouble. Subsequently, however, several observers provided with very\r\npowerful instruments found that the famous line in the chromosphere\r\nreally had a very faint companion line. Thus the identity between the\r\ncelestial helium and the gas found on our globe was established in the\r\nmost remarkable manner. Certain circumstances have seemed to indicate\r\nthat the new gas might possibly be a mixture of two gases of different\r\ndensities, but up to the present this has not been proved to be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAfter it had been found possible to see the spectra of prominences\r\nwithout waiting for an eclipse, Sir W. Huggins, in an observation on the\r\n13th of February, 1869, successfully applied a method for viewing the\r\nremarkable solar objects themselves instead of their mere spectra in\r\nfull sunshine. It is only necessary to adjust the spectroscope so that\r\none of the brightest lines--_e.g._ the red hydrogen line--is in the\r\nmiddle of the field of the viewing telescope, and then to open wide the\r\nslit of the spectroscope. A red image of the prominence will then be\r\ndisplayed instead of the mere line. In fact, when the slit is opened\r\nwide, the prisms produce a series of detached images of the prominence\r\nunder observation, one for each kind of light which the object emits.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the spectroscope as depending upon the action of glass\r\nprisms. It remains to be added that in the highest class of\r\nspectroscopes the prisms are replaced by ruled gratings from which the\r\nlight is reflected. The effect of the ruling is to produce by what is\r\nknown as diffraction the required breaking up of the beam of light into\r\nits constituent parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nSOLAR PROMINENCES.\r\n\r\n(DRAWN BY TROUVELOT AT HARVARD COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, U.S., IN 1872.)]\r\n\r\nMajestic indeed are the proportions of some of those mighty prominences\r\nwhich leap from the luminous surface; yet they flicker, as do our\r\nterrestrial flames, when we allow them time comparable to their gigantic\r\ndimensions. Drawings of the same prominence made at intervals of a few\r\nhours, or even less, often show great changes. The magnitude of the\r\ndisplacements that have been noticed sometimes attains many thousands of\r\nmiles, and the actual velocity with which such masses move frequently\r\nexceeds 100 miles a second. Still more violent are the convulsions when,\r\nfrom the surface of the chromosphere, as from a mighty furnace, vast\r\nincandescent masses of gas are projected upwards. Plate IV. gives a view\r\nof a number of prominences as seen by Trouvelot at Harvard College\r\nObservatory, Cambridge, U.S.A. Trouvelot has succeeded in exhibiting in\r\nthe different pictures the wondrous variety of aspect which these\r\nobjects assume. The dimensions of the prominences may be inferred from\r\nthe scale appended to the plate. The largest of those here shown is\r\nfully 80,000 miles high; and trustworthy observers have recorded\r\nprominences of an altitude even much greater. The rapid changes which\r\nthese objects sometimes undergo are well illustrated in the two sketches\r\non the left of the lowest line, which were drawn on April 27th, 1872.\r\nThese are both drawings of the same prominence taken at an interval no\r\ngreater than twenty minutes. This mighty flame is so vast that its\r\nlength is ten times as great as the diameter of the earth, yet in this\r\nbrief period it has completely changed its aspect; the upper part of the\r\nflame has, indeed, broken away, and is now shown in that part of the\r\ndrawing between the two figures on the line above. The same plate also\r\nshows various instances of the remarkable spike-like objects, taken,\r\nhowever, at different times and at various parts of the sun. These\r\nspikes attain altitudes not generally greater than 20,000 miles, though\r\nsometimes they soar aloft to stupendous distances.\r\n\r\nWe may refer to one special object of this kind, the remarkable history\r\nof which has been chronicled by Professor Young. On October 7th, 1880, a\r\nprominence was seen, at about 10.30 a.m., on the south-east limb of the\r\nsun. It was then about 40,000 miles high, and attracted no special\r\nattention. Half an hour later a marvellous transformation had taken\r\nplace. During that brief interval the prominence became very brilliant\r\nand doubled its length. For another hour the mighty flame still soared\r\nupwards, until it attained the unprecedented elevation of 350,000\r\nmiles--a distance more than one-third the diameter of the great luminary\r\nitself. At this climax the energy of the mighty outbreak seems to have\r\nat last become exhausted: the flame broke up into fragments, and by\r\n12.30--an interval of only two hours from the time when it was first\r\nnoticed--the phenomenon had completely faded away.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this particular eruption was exceptional in its vehemence, and\r\nin the vastness of the changes of which it was an indication. The\r\nvelocity of upheaval must have been at least 200,000 miles an hour, or,\r\nto put it in another form, more than fifty miles a second. This mighty\r\nflame leaped from the sun with a velocity more than 100 times as great\r\nas that of the swiftest bullet ever fired from a rifle.\r\n\r\nThe prominences may be generally divided into two classes. We have first\r\nthose which are comparatively quiescent, and in form somewhat resemble\r\nthe clouds which float in our earth's atmosphere. The second class of\r\nprominences are best described as eruptive. They are, in fact, thrown up\r\nfrom the chromosphere like gigantic jets of incandescent material. These\r\ntwo classes of objects differ not only in appearance but also in the\r\ngases of which they are composed. The cloud-like prominences consist\r\nmainly of hydrogen, with helium and calcium, while many metals are\r\npresent in the eruptive discharges. The latter are never seen in the\r\nneighbourhood of the sun's poles, but generally appear close to a\r\nsun-spot, thus confirming the conclusion that the spots are associated\r\nwith violent disturbances on the surface of the sun. When a spot has\r\nreached the limb of the sun it is frequently found to be surrounded by\r\nprominences. It has even been possible in a few instances to detect\r\npowerful gaseous eruptions in the neighbourhood of a spot, the\r\nspectroscope rendering them visible against the background of the solar\r\nsurface just as the prominences are observed at the limb against the\r\nbackground of the sky.\r\n\r\nIn order to photograph a prominence we have, of course, to substitute a\r\nphotographic plate for the observer's eye. Owing, however, to the\r\ndifficulty of preventing the feeble light from the prominence from being\r\noverpowered by extraneous light, the photography of these bodies was not\r\nvery successful until Professor Hale, of Chicago, designed his\r\nspectro-heliograph. In this instrument there is (in addition to the\r\nusual slit through which the light falls on the prisms, or grating,) a\r\nsecond slit immediately in front of the photographic plate through which\r\nthe light of a given wave-length can be permitted to pass to the\r\nexclusion of all the rest. The light chosen for producing an image of\r\nthe prominences is that radiated in the remarkable \"K line,\" due to\r\ncalcium. This lies at the extreme end of the violet. The light from that\r\npart of the spectrum, though it is invisible to the eye, is much more\r\nactive photographically than the light from the red, yellow, or green\r\nparts of the spectrum. The front slit is adjusted so that the K line\r\nfalls upon the second slit, and as the front slit is slowly swept by\r\nclockwork over the whole of a prominence, the second slit keeps pace\r\nwith it by a mechanical contrivance.\r\n\r\nIf the image of the solar disc is hidden by a screen of exactly the\r\nproper size, the slits may be made to sweep over the whole sun, thus\r\ngiving us at one exposure a picture of the chromospheric ring round the\r\nsun's limb with its prominences. The screen may now be withdrawn, and\r\nthe slits may be made to sweep rapidly over the disc itself. They reveal\r\nthe existence of glowing calcium vapours in many parts of the surface of\r\nthe sun. Thus we get a striking picture of the sun as drawn by this\r\nparticular light. In this manner Professor Hale confirmed the\r\nobservation made long before by Professor Young, that the spectra of\r\nfaculæ always show the two great calcium bands.\r\n\r\nThe velocity with which a prominence shoots upward from the sun's limb\r\ncan, of course, be measured directly by observations of the ordinary\r\nkind with a micrometer. The spectroscope, however, enables us to\r\nestimate the speed with which disturbances at the surface of the sun\r\ntravel in the direction towards the earth or from the earth. We can\r\nmeasure this speed by watching the peculiar behaviour of the spectral\r\nlines representing the rapidly moving masses. This opens up a remarkable\r\nline of investigation with important applications in many branches of\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, now generally understood that the sensation of light\r\nis caused by waves or undulations which impinge on the retina of the\r\neye after having been transmitted through that medium which we call the\r\nether. To the different colours correspond different wave-lengths--that\r\nis to say, different distances between two successive waves. A beam of\r\nwhite light is formed by the union of innumerable different waves whose\r\nlengths have almost every possible value lying between certain limits.\r\nThe wave-length of red light is such that there are 33,000 waves in an\r\ninch, while that of violet light is but little more than half that of\r\nred light. The position of a line in the spectrum depends solely on the\r\nwave-length of the light to which it is due. Suppose that the source of\r\nlight is approaching directly towards the observer; obviously the waves\r\nfollow each other more closely than if the source were at rest, and the\r\nnumber of undulations which his eye receives in a second must be\r\nproportionately increased. Thus the distance between two successive\r\nether waves will be very slightly diminished. A well-known phenomenon of\r\na similar character is the change of pitch of the whistle of a\r\nlocomotive engine as it rushes past. This is particularly noticeable if\r\nthe observer happens to be in a train which is moving rapidly in the\r\nopposite direction. In the case of sound, of course, the vibrations or\r\nwaves take place in the air and not in the ether. But the effect of\r\nmotion to or from the observer is strictly analogous in the two cases.\r\nAs, however, light travels 186,000 miles a second, the source of light\r\nwill also have to travel with a very high velocity in order to produce\r\neven the smallest perceptible change in the position of a spectral line.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that enormously high velocities are by no means\r\nuncommon in some of these mighty disturbances on the sun; accordingly,\r\nwhen we examine the spectrum of a sun-spot, we often see that some of\r\nthe lines are shifted a little towards one end of the spectrum and\r\nsometimes towards the other, while in other cases the lines are seen to\r\nbe distorted or twisted in the most fantastic manner, indicating very\r\nviolent local commotions. If the spot happens to be near the centre of\r\nthe sun's disc, the gases must be shooting upwards or downwards to\r\nproduce these changes in the lines. The velocities indicated in\r\nobservations of this class sometimes amount to as much as two or even\r\nthree hundred miles per second. We find it difficult to conceive the\r\nenormous internal pressures which are required to impel such mighty\r\nmasses of gases aloft from the photosphere with speeds so terrific, or\r\nthe conditions which bring about the downrush of such gigantic masses of\r\nvapour from above. In the spectra of the prominences on the sun's limb\r\nalso we often see the bright lines bent or shifted to one side. In such\r\ncases what we witness is evidently caused by movements along the surface\r\nof the chromosphere, conveying materials towards us or away from us.\r\n\r\nAn interesting application of this beautiful method of measuring the\r\nspeed of moving bodies has been made in various attempts to determine\r\nthe period of rotation of the sun spectroscopically. As the sun turns\r\nround on its axis, a point on the eastern limb is moving towards the\r\nobserver and a point on the western limb is moving away from him. In\r\neach case the velocity is a little over a mile per second. At the\r\neastern limb the lines in the solar spectrum are very slightly shifted\r\ntowards the violet end of the spectrum, while the lines in the spectrum\r\nof the western limb are equally shifted towards the red end. By an\r\ningenious optical contrivance it is possible to place the spectra from\r\nthe two limbs side by side, which doubles the apparent displacement, and\r\nthus makes it much more easy to measure. Even with this contrivance the\r\nvisual quantities to be measured remain exceedingly minute. All the\r\nparts of the instrument have to be most accurately adjusted, and the\r\nobservations are correspondingly delicate. They have been attempted by\r\nvarious observers. Among the most successful investigations of this kind\r\nwe may mention that of the Swedish astronomer, Dunér, who, by pointing\r\nhis instrument to a number of places on the limb, found values in good\r\nagreement with the peculiar law of rotation which has been deduced from\r\nthe motion of sun-spots. This result is specially interesting, as it\r\nshows that the atmospheric layers, in which that absorption takes place\r\nwhich produces the dark lines in the spectrum, shares in the motion of\r\nthe photosphere at the same latitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--View of the Corona (and a Comet) in a Total\r\nEclipse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nTOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE, JULY 29TH, 1878.\r\n\r\nTHE CORONA FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n(HARKNESS.)]\r\n\r\nWe have yet to mention one other striking phenomenon which is among the\r\nchief attractions to observers of total eclipses, and which it has\r\nhitherto not been found possible to see in full daylight. This is the\r\ncorona or aureole of light which is suddenly seen to surround the sun in\r\nan eclipse when the moon has completely covered the last remaining\r\ncrescent of the sun. A general idea of the appearance of the corona is\r\ngiven in Fig. 20, and we further present in Plate V. the drawing of the\r\ncorona made by Professor Harkness from a comparison of a large number of\r\nphotographs obtained at different places in the United States during the\r\ntotal eclipse of July 29th, 1878. In Fig. 21 we are permitted by the\r\nkindness of Mr. and Mrs. Maunder to reproduce the remarkable photograph\r\nof the corona which they obtained in India during the eclipse of January\r\n22nd, 1898.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--View of Corona during the Eclipse of Jan. 22nd,\r\n1898 (_Reproduced by kind permission of Mr. and Mrs. Maunder and of the\r\nproprietors of \"Knowledge._\")]\r\n\r\nThe part of the corona nearest the sun is very bright, though not so\r\nbrilliant as the prominences, which (as Professor Young says) blaze\r\nthrough it like carbuncles. This inner portion is generally of fairly\r\nregular outline, forming a white ring about a tenth part of the solar\r\ndiameter in width. The outer parts of the corona are usually very\r\nirregular and very extensive. They are often interrupted by narrow\r\n\"rifts,\" or narrow dark bands, which reach from the limb of the sun\r\nthrough the entire corona. On the other hand, there are also sometimes\r\nnarrow bright streamers, inclined at various angles to the limb of the\r\nsun and not seldom curved. In the eclipses of 1867, 1878, and 1889, all\r\nof which occurred at periods of sun-spot minimum, the corona showed long\r\nand faint streamers nearly in the direction of the sun's equator, and\r\nshort but distinct brushes of light near the poles. In the eclipses of\r\n1870, 1882, and 1893, near sun-spot maxima, the corona was more\r\nregularly circular, and chiefly developed over the spot zones. We have\r\nhere another proof (if one were necessary) of the intimate connection\r\nbetween the periodicity of the spots and the development of all other\r\nsolar phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn the spectrum of the corona there is a mysterious line in the green,\r\nas to the origin of which nothing is at present certainly known. It is\r\nbest seen during eclipses occurring near the time of sun-spot maximum.\r\nIt is presented in the ordinary solar spectrum as a very thin, dark\r\nline, which generally remains undisturbed even when lines of hydrogen\r\nand other substances are twisted and distorted by the violent rush of\r\ndisturbed elements. The line is always present among the bright lines of\r\nthe chromosphere spectrum. In addition to it the corona shows a few\r\nother bright lines, belonging, no doubt, to the same unknown element\r\n(\"coronium\"), and also a faint continuous spectrum, in which even a few\r\nof the more prominent dark lines of the solar spectrum have been\r\nsometimes detected. This shows that in addition to glowing gas\r\n(represented by the bright lines) the corona also contains a great deal\r\nof matter like dust, or fog, the minute particles of which are capable\r\nof reflecting the sunlight and thereby producing a feeble continuous\r\nspectrum. This matter seems to form the principal constituent of the\r\nlong coronal rays and streamers, as the latter are not visible in the\r\ndetached images of the corona which appear instead of the bright lines\r\nwhen the corona is viewed, or photographed, during an eclipse, in a\r\nspectroscope without a slit. If the long rays were composed of the gas\r\nor gases which constitute the inner corona, it is evident that they\r\nought to appear in these detached images. As to the nature of the forces\r\nwhich are continually engaged in shooting out these enormously long\r\nstreamers, we have at present but little information. It is, however,\r\ncertain that the extensive atmospheric envelope round the sun, which\r\nshows itself as the inner corona, must be extremely attenuated. Comets\r\nhave on several occasions been known to rush through this coronal\r\natmosphere without evincing the slightest appreciable diminution in\r\ntheir speed from the resistance to which they were exposed.\r\n\r\nWe have accumulated by observation a great number of facts concerning\r\nthe sun, but when we try to draw from these facts conclusions as to the\r\nphysical constitution of that great body, it cannot be denied that the\r\ndifficulties seem to be very great indeed. We find that the best\r\nauthorities differ considerably in the opinions they entertain as to its\r\nnature. We shall here set forth the principal conclusions as to which\r\nthere is little or no controversy.\r\n\r\nWe shall see in a following chapter that astronomers have been able to\r\ndetermine the relative densities of the bodies in the solar system; in\r\nother words, they have found the relation between the quantities of\r\nmatter contained in an equally large volume of each. It has thus been\r\nascertained that the average density of the sun is about a quarter that\r\nof the earth. If we compare the weight of the sun with that of an\r\nequally great globe of water, we find that the luminary would be barely\r\none and a half times as heavy as the water. Of course, the actual mass\r\nof the sun is very enormous; it is no less than 330,000 times as great\r\nas that of the earth. The solar material itself is, however, relatively\r\nlight, so that the sun is four times as big as it would have to be if,\r\nwhile its weight remained the same, its density equalled that of the\r\nearth. Bearing in mind this lightness of the sun, and also the\r\nexceedingly high temperature which we know to prevail there, no other\r\nconclusion seems possible than that the body of the sun must be in a\r\ngaseous state. The conditions under which such gases exist in the sun\r\nare, no doubt, altogether different from those with which we are\r\nacquainted on the earth. At the surface of the sun the force of gravity\r\nis more than twenty-seven times as great as it is on the earth. A person\r\nwho on the earth could just lift twenty-seven equal pieces of metal\r\nwould, if he were transferred to the sun, only be able to lift one of\r\nthe pieces at a time. The pressure of the gases below the surface must\r\ntherefore be very great, and it might be supposed that they would become\r\nliquefied in consequence. It was, however, discovered by Andrews that so\r\nlong as a gas is kept at a temperature higher than a certain point,\r\nknown as the \"critical temperature\" (which is different for different\r\ngases), the gas will not be turned into a liquid however great be the\r\npressure to which it is submitted. The temperature on the sun cannot be\r\nlower than the critical temperatures of the gases there existing; so it\r\nwould seem that even the enormous pressure can hardly reduce the gases\r\nin the great luminary to the liquid form.\r\n\r\nOf the interior of the sun we can, of course, expect to learn little or\r\nnothing. What we observe is the surface-layer, the so-called\r\nphotosphere, in which the cold of space produces the condensation of the\r\ngases into those luminous clouds which we see in our drawings and\r\nphotographs as \"rice grains\" or \"willow leaves.\" It has been suggested\r\nby Dr. Johnstone Stoney (and afterwards by Professor Hastings, of\r\nBaltimore) that these luminous clouds are mainly composed of carbon with\r\nthose of the related elements silicon and boron, the boiling points of\r\nwhich are much higher than those of other elements which might be\r\nconsidered likely to form the photospheric clouds. The low atomic weight\r\nof carbon must also have the effect of giving the molecules of this\r\nelement a very high velocity, and thereby enabling them to work their\r\nway into the upper regions, where the temperature has so fallen that the\r\nvapour becomes chilled into cloud. A necessary consequence of the rapid\r\ncooling of these clouds, and the consequent radiation of heat on a\r\nlarge scale, would be the formation of what we may perhaps describe as\r\nsmoke, which settles by degrees through the intervals between the clouds\r\n(making these intervals appear darker) until it is again volatilised on\r\nreaching a level of greater heat below the clouds. This same smoke is\r\nprobably the cause of the well-known fact that the solar limb is\r\nconsiderably fainter than the middle of the disc. This seems to arise\r\nfrom the greater absorption caused by the longer distance which a ray of\r\nlight from a point near the limb has to travel through this layer of\r\nsmoke before reaching the earth. It is shown that this absorption cannot\r\nbe attributed to a gaseous atmosphere, since this would have the effect\r\nof producing more dark absorption lines in the spectrum. There would\r\nthus be a marked difference between the solar spectrum from a part near\r\nthe middle of the disc and the spectrum from a part near the limb. This,\r\nhowever, we do not find to be the case.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the nature of sun-spots, the idea first suggested by\r\nSecchi and Lockyer, that they represent down rushes of cooler vapours\r\ninto the photosphere (or to its surface), seems on the whole to accord\r\nbest with the observed phenomena. We have already mentioned that the\r\nspots are generally accompanied by faculæ and eruptive prominences in\r\ntheir immediate neighbourhood, but whether these eruptions are caused by\r\nthe downfall of the vapour which makes the photospheric matter \"splash\r\nup\" in the vicinity, or whether the eruptions come first, and by\r\ndiminishing the upward pressure from below form a \"sink,\" into which\r\noverlying cooler vapour descends, are problems as to which opinions are\r\nstill much divided.\r\n\r\nA remarkable appendage to the sun, which extends to a distance very much\r\ngreater than that of the corona, produces the phenomenon of the zodiacal\r\nlight. A pearly glow is sometimes seen in the spring to spread over a\r\npart of the sky in the vicinity of the point where the sun has\r\ndisappeared after sunset. The same spectacle may also be witnessed\r\nbefore sunrise in the autumn, and it would seem as if the material\r\nproducing the zodiacal light, whatever it may be, had a lens-shaped\r\nform with the sun in the centre. The nature of this object is still a\r\nmatter of uncertainty, but it is probably composed of a kind of dust, as\r\nthe faint spectrum it affords is of a continuous type. A view of the\r\nzodiacal light is shown in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nIn all directions the sun pours forth, with the most prodigal\r\nliberality, its torrents of light and of heat. The earth can only grasp\r\nthe merest fraction, less than the 2,000,000,000th part of the whole.\r\nOur fellow planets and the moon also intercept a trifle; but how small\r\nis the portion of the mighty flood which they can utilise! The sip that\r\na flying swallow takes from a river is as far from exhausting the water\r\nin the river as are the planets from using all the heat which streams\r\nfrom the sun.\r\n\r\nThe sun's gracious beams supply the magic power that enables the corn to\r\ngrow and ripen. It is the heat of the sun which raises water from the\r\nocean in the form of vapour, and then sends down that vapour as rain to\r\nrefresh the earth and to fill the rivers which bear our ships down to\r\nthe ocean. It is the heat of the sun beating on the large continents\r\nwhich gives rise to the breezes and winds that waft our vessels across\r\nthe deep; and when on a winter's evening we draw around the fire and\r\nfeel its invigorating rays, we are only enjoying sunbeams which shone on\r\nthe earth countless ages ago. The heat in those ancient sunbeams\r\ndeveloped the mighty vegetation of the coal period, and in the form of\r\ncoal that heat has slumbered for millions of years, till we now call it\r\nagain into activity. It is the power of the sun stored up in coal that\r\nurges on our steam-engines. It is the light of the sun stored up in coal\r\nthat beams from every gaslight in our cities.\r\n\r\nFor the power to live and move, for the plenty with which we are\r\nsurrounded, for the beauty with which nature is adorned, we are\r\nimmediately indebted to one body in the countless hosts of space, and\r\nthat body is the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--The Zodiacal Light in 1874.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Moon and the Tides--The Use of the Moon in Navigation--The\r\n     Changes of the Moon--The Moon and the Poets--Whence the Light of\r\n     the Moon?--Sizes of the Earth and the Moon--Weight of the\r\n     Moon--Changes in Apparent Size--Variations in its\r\n     Distance--Influence of the Earth on the Moon--The Path of the\r\n     Moon--Explanation of the Moon's Phases--Lunar Eclipses--Eclipses of\r\n     the Sun, how produced--Visibility of the Moon in a Total\r\n     Eclipse--How Eclipses are Predicted--Uses of the Moon in finding\r\n     Longitude--The Moon not connected with the Weather--Topography of\r\n     the Moon--Nasmyth's Drawing of Triesnecker--Volcanoes on the\r\n     Moon--Normal Lunar Crater--Plato--The Shadows of Lunar\r\n     Mountains--The Micrometer--Lunar Heights--Former Activity on the\r\n     Moon--Nasmyth's View of the Formation of Craters--Gravitation on\r\n     the Moon--Varied Sizes of the Lunar Craters--Other Features of the\r\n     Moon--Is there Life on the Moon?--Absence of Water and of Air--Dr.\r\n     Stoney's Theory--Explanation of the Rugged Character of Lunar\r\n     Scenery--Possibility of Life on Distant Bodies in Space.\r\n\r\nIf the moon were suddenly struck out of existence, we should be\r\nimmediately apprised of the fact by a wail from every seaport in the\r\nkingdom. From London and from Liverpool we should hear the same\r\nstory--the rise and fall of the tide had almost ceased. The ships in\r\ndock could not get out; the ships outside could not get in; and the\r\nmaritime commerce of the world would be thrown into dire confusion.\r\n\r\nThe moon is the principal agent in causing the daily ebb and flow of the\r\ntide, and this is the most important work which our satellite has to do.\r\nThe fleets of fishing boats around the coasts time their daily movements\r\nby the tide, and are largely indebted to the moon for bringing them in\r\nand out of harbour. Experienced sailors assure us that the tides are of\r\nthe utmost service to navigation. The question as to how the moon causes\r\nthe tides is postponed to a future chapter, in which we shall also\r\nsketch the marvellous part which the tides seem to have played in the\r\nearly history of our earth.\r\n\r\nWho is there that has not watched, with admiration, the beautiful series\r\nof changes through which the moon passes every month? We first see her\r\nas an exquisite crescent of pale light in the western sky after sunset.\r\nIf the night is fine, the rest of the moon is visible inside the\r\ncrescent, being faintly illumined by light reflected from our own earth.\r\nNight after night she moves further and further to the east, until she\r\nbecomes full, and rises about the same time that the sun sets. From the\r\ntime of the full the disc of light begins to diminish until the last\r\nquarter is reached. Then it is that the moon is seen high in the heavens\r\nin the morning. As the days pass by, the crescent shape is again\r\nassumed. The crescent wanes thinner and thinner as the satellite draws\r\ncloser to the sun. Finally she becomes lost in the overpowering light of\r\nthe sun, again to emerge as the new moon, and again to go through the\r\nsame cycle of changes.\r\n\r\nThe brilliance of the moon arises solely from the light of the sun,\r\nwhich falls on the not self-luminous substance of the moon. Out of the\r\nvast flood of light which the sun pours forth with such prodigality into\r\nspace the dark body of the moon intercepts a little, and of that little\r\nit reflects a small fraction to illuminate the earth. The moon sheds so\r\nmuch light, and seems so bright, that it is often difficult at night to\r\nremember that the moon has no light except what falls on it from the\r\nsun. Nevertheless, the actual surface of the brightest full moon is\r\nperhaps not much brighter than the streets of London on a clear sunshiny\r\nday. A very simple observation will suffice to show that the moon's\r\nlight is only sunlight. Look some morning at the moon in daylight, and\r\ncompare the moon with the clouds. The brightness of the moon and of the\r\nclouds are directly comparable, and then it can be readily comprehended\r\nhow the sun which illuminates the clouds has also illumined the moon. An\r\nattempt has been made to form a comparative estimate of the brightness\r\nof the sun and the full moon. If 600,000 full moons were shining at\r\nonce, their collective brilliancy would equal that of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful crescent moon has furnished a theme for many a poet.\r\nIndeed, if we may venture to say so, it would seem that some poets have\r\nforgotten that the moon is not to be seen every night. A poetical\r\ndescription of evening is almost certain to be associated with the\r\nappearance of the moon in some phase or other. We may cite one notable\r\ninstance in which a poet, describing an historical event, has enshrined\r\nin exquisite verse a statement which cannot be correct. Every child who\r\nspeaks our language has been taught that the burial of Sir John Moore\r\ntook place\r\n\r\n  \"By the struggling moonbeams' misty light.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an appearance of detail in this statement which wears the garb\r\nof truth. We are not inclined to doubt that the night was misty, nor as\r\nto whether the moonbeams had to struggle into visibility; the question\r\nat issue is a much more fundamental one. We do not know who was the\r\nfirst to raise the point as to whether any moon shone on that memorable\r\nevent at all or not; but the question having been raised, the Nautical\r\nAlmanac immediately supplies an answer. From it we learn in language,\r\nwhose truthfulness constitutes its only claim to be poetry, that the\r\nmoon was new at one o'clock in the morning of the day of the battle of\r\nCorunna (16th January, 1809). The ballad evidently implies that the\r\nfuneral took place on the night following the battle. We are therefore\r\nassured that the moon can hardly have been a day old when the hero was\r\nconsigned to his grave. But the moon in such a case is practically\r\ninvisible, and yields no appreciable moonbeams at all, misty or\r\notherwise. Indeed, if the funeral took place at the \"dead of night,\" as\r\nthe poet asserts, then the moon must have been far below the horizon at\r\nthe time.[6]\r\n\r\nIn alluding to this and similar instances, Mr. Nasmyth gives a word of\r\nadvice to authors or to artists who desire to bring the moon on a scene\r\nwithout knowing as a matter of fact that our satellite was actually\r\npresent. He recommends them to follow the example of Bottom in _A\r\nMidsummer's Night's Dream_, and consult \"a calendar, a calendar! Look in\r\nthe almanac; find out moonshine, find out moonshine!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Comparative Sizes of the Earth and the Moon.]\r\n\r\nAmong the countless host of celestial bodies--the sun, the moon, the\r\nplanets, and the stars--our satellite enjoys one special claim on our\r\nattention. The moon is our nearest permanent neighbour. It is just\r\npossible that a comet may occasionally approach the earth more closely\r\nthan the moon but with this exception the other celestial bodies are all\r\nmany hundreds or thousands, or even many millions, of times further from\r\nus than the moon.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed that the moon is one of the smallest visible\r\nobjects which the heavens contain. Every one of the thousands of stars\r\nthat can be seen with the unaided eye is enormously larger than our\r\nsatellite. The brilliance and apparent vast proportions of the moon\r\narise from the fact that it is only 240,000 miles away, which is a\r\ndistance almost immeasurably small when compared with the distances\r\nbetween the earth and the stars.\r\n\r\nFig. 23 exhibits the relative sizes of the earth and its attendant. The\r\nsmall globe shows the moon, while the larger globe represents the earth.\r\nWhen we measure the actual diameters of the two globes, we find that of\r\nthe earth to be 7,918 miles and of the moon 2,160 miles, so that the\r\ndiameter of the earth is nearly four times greater than the diameter of\r\nthe moon. If the earth were cut into fifty pieces, all equally large,\r\nthen one of these pieces rolled into a globe would equal the size of the\r\nmoon. The superficial extent of the moon is equal to about one\r\nthirteenth part of the surface of the earth. The hemisphere our\r\nneighbour turns towards us exhibits an area equal to about one\r\ntwenty-seventh part of the area of the earth. This, to speak\r\napproximately, is about double the actual extent of the continent of\r\nEurope. The average materials of the earth are, however, much heavier\r\nthan those contained in the moon. It would take more than eighty globes,\r\neach as ponderous as the moon, to weigh down the earth.\r\n\r\nAmid the changes which the moon presents to us, one obvious fact stands\r\nprominently forth. Whether our satellite be new or full, at first\r\nquarter or at last, whether it be high in the heavens or low near the\r\nhorizon, whether it be in process of eclipse by the sun, or whether the\r\nsun himself is being eclipsed by the moon, the apparent size of the\r\nlatter is nearly constant. We can express the matter numerically. A\r\nglobe one foot in diameter, at a distance of 111 feet from the observer,\r\nwould under ordinary circumstances be just sufficient to hide the disc\r\nof the moon; occasionally, however, the globe would have to be brought\r\nin to a distance of only 103 feet, or occasionally it might have to be\r\nmoved out to so much as 118 feet, if the moon is to be exactly hidden.\r\nIt is unusual for the moon to approach either of its extreme limits of\r\nposition, so that the distance from the eye at which the globe must be\r\nsituated so as to exactly cover the moon is usually more than 105 feet,\r\nand less than 117 feet. These fluctuations in the apparent size of our\r\nsatellite are contained within such narrow limits that in the first\r\nglance at the subject they may be overlooked. It will be easily seen\r\nthat the apparent size of the moon must be connected with its real\r\ndistance from the earth. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the\r\nmoon were to recede into space, its size would seem to dwindle, and long\r\nere it had reached the distance of even the very nearest of the other\r\ncelestial bodies it would have shrunk into insignificance. On the other\r\nhand, if the moon were to come nearer to the earth, its apparent size\r\nwould gradually increase until, when close to our globe, it would seem\r\nlike a mighty continent stretching over the sky. We find that the\r\napparent size of the moon is nearly constant, and hence we infer that\r\nthe average distance of the same body is also nearly constant. The\r\naverage value of that distance is 239,000 miles. In rare circumstances\r\nit may approach to a distance but little more than 221,000 miles, or\r\nrecede to a distance hardly less than 253,000 miles, but the ordinary\r\nfluctuations do not exceed more than about 13,000 miles on either side\r\nof its mean value.\r\n\r\nFrom the moon's incessant changes we perceive that she is in constant\r\nmotion, and we now further see that whatever these movements may be, the\r\nearth and the moon must at present remain at _nearly_ the same distance\r\napart. If we further add that the path pursued by the moon around the\r\nheavens lies nearly in a plane, then we are forced to the conclusion\r\nthat our satellite must be revolving in a nearly circular path around\r\nthe earth at the centre. It can, indeed, be shown that the constant\r\ndistance of the two bodies involves as a necessary condition the\r\nrevolution of the moon around the earth. The attraction between the moon\r\nand the earth tends to bring the two bodies together. The only way by\r\nwhich such a catastrophe can be permanently avoided is by making the\r\nsatellite move as we actually find it to do. The attraction between the\r\nearth and the moon still exists, but its effect is not then shown in\r\nbringing the moon in towards the earth. The attraction has now to exert\r\nits whole power in restraining the moon in its circular path; were the\r\nattraction to cease, the moon would start off in a straight line, and\r\nrecede never to return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--The Moon's Path around the Sun.]\r\n\r\nThe fact of the moon's revolution around the earth is easily\r\ndemonstrated by observations of the stars. The rising and setting of our\r\nsatellite is, of course, due to the rotation of the earth, and this\r\napparent diurnal movement the moon possesses in common with the sun and\r\nwith the stars. It will, however, be noticed that the moon is\r\ncontinually changing its place among the stars. Even in the course of a\r\nsingle night the displacement will be conspicuous to a careful observer\r\nwithout the aid of a telescope. The moon completes each revolution\r\naround the earth in a period of 27·3 days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--The Phases of the Moon.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 24 we have a view of the relative positions of the earth, the\r\nsun, and the moon, but it is to be observed that, for the convenience of\r\nillustration, we have been obliged to represent the orbit of the moon on\r\na much larger scale than it ought to be in comparison with the distance\r\nof the sun. That half of the moon which is turned towards the sun is\r\nbrilliantly illuminated, and, according as we see more or less of that\r\nbrilliant half, we say that the moon is more or less full, the several\r\n\"phases\" being visible in the succession shown by the numbers in Fig.\r\n25. A beginner sometimes finds considerable difficulty in understanding\r\nhow the light on the full moon at night can have been derived from the\r\nsun. \"Is not,\" he will say, \"the earth in the way? and must it not\r\nintercept the sunlight from every object on the other side of the earth\r\nto the sun?\" A study of Fig. 24 will explain the difficulty. The plane\r\nin which the moon revolves does not coincide with the plane in which the\r\nearth revolves around the sun. The line in which the plane of the\r\nearth's motion is intersected by that of the moon divides the moon's\r\npath into two semicircles. We must imagine the moon's path to be tilted\r\na little, so that the upper semicircle is somewhat above the plane of\r\nthe paper, and the other semicircle below. It thus follows that when the\r\nmoon is in the position marked full, under the circumstances shown in\r\nthe figure, the moon will be just above the line joining the earth and\r\nthe sun; the sunlight will thus pass over the earth to the moon, and the\r\nmoon will be illuminated. At new moon, the moon will be under the line\r\njoining the earth and the sun.\r\n\r\nAs the relative positions of the earth and the sun are changing, it\r\nhappens twice in each revolution that the sun comes into the position of\r\nthe line of intersection of the two planes. If this occurs at the time\r\nof full moon, the earth lies directly between the moon and the sun; the\r\nmoon is thus plunged into the shadow of the earth, the light from the\r\nsun is intercepted, and we say that the moon is eclipsed. The moon\r\nsometimes only partially enters the earth's shadow, in which case the\r\neclipse is a partial one. When, on the other hand, the sun is situated\r\non the line of intersection at the time of new moon, the moon lies\r\ndirectly between the earth and the sun, and the dark body of the moon\r\nwill then cut off the sunlight from the earth, producing a solar\r\neclipse. Usually only a part of the sun is thus obscured, forming the\r\nwell-known partial eclipse; if, however, the moon pass centrally over\r\nthe sun, then we must have one or other of two very remarkable kinds of\r\neclipse. Sometimes the moon entirely blots out the sun, and thus is\r\nproduced the sublime spectacle of a total eclipse, which tells us so\r\nmuch as to the nature of the sun, and to which we have already referred\r\nin the last chapter. Even when the moon is placed centrally over the\r\nsun, a thin rim of sunlight is occasionally seen round the margin of the\r\nmoon. We then have what is known as an annular eclipse.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the moon is sometimes able to hide the sun\r\ncompletely, while on other occasions it fails to do so. It happens that\r\nthe average apparent size of the moon is nearly equal to the average\r\napparent size of the sun, but, owing to the fluctuations in their\r\ndistances, the actual apparent sizes of both bodies undergo certain\r\nchanges. On certain occasions the apparent size of the moon is greater\r\nthan that of the sun. In this case a central passage produces a total\r\neclipse; but it may also happen that the apparent size of the sun\r\nexceeds that of the moon, in which case a central passage can only\r\nproduce an annular eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Form of the Earth's Shadow, showing the\r\nPenumbra, or partially shaded region. Within the Penumbra, the Moon is\r\nvisible; in the Shadow it is nearly invisible.]\r\n\r\nThere are hardly any more interesting celestial phenomena than the\r\ndifferent descriptions of eclipses. The almanac will always give timely\r\nnotice of the occurrence, and the more striking features can be observed\r\nwithout a telescope. In an eclipse of the moon (Fig. 26) it is\r\ninteresting to note the moment when the black shadow is first detected,\r\nto watch its gradual encroachment over the bright surface of the moon,\r\nto follow it, in case the eclipse is total, until there is only a thin\r\ncrescent of moonlight left, and to watch the final extinction of that\r\ncrescent when the whole moon is plunged into the shadow. But now a\r\nspectacle of great interest and beauty is often manifested; for though\r\nthe moon is so hidden behind the earth that not a single direct ray of\r\nthe sunlight could reach its surface, yet we often find that the moon\r\nremains visible, and, indeed, actually glows with a copper-coloured hue\r\nbright enough to permit several of the markings on the surface to be\r\ndiscerned.\r\n\r\nThis illumination of the moon even in the depth of a total eclipse is\r\ndue to the sunbeams which have just grazed the edge of the earth. In\r\ndoing so they have become bent by the refraction of the atmosphere, and\r\nhave thus been turned inwards into the shadow. Such beams have passed\r\nthrough a prodigious thickness of the earth's atmosphere, and in this\r\nlong journey through hundreds of miles of air they have become tinged\r\nwith a ruddy or copper-like hue. Nor is this property of our atmosphere\r\nan unfamiliar one. The sun both at sunrise and at sunset glows with a\r\nlight which is much more ruddy than the beams it dispenses at noonday.\r\nBut at sunset or at sunrise the rays which reach our eyes have much more\r\nof our atmosphere to penetrate than they have at noon, and accordingly\r\nthe atmosphere imparts to them that ruddy colour so characteristic and\r\noften so lovely. If the spectrum of the sun when close to the horizon is\r\nexamined it is seen to be filled with numerous dark lines and bands\r\nsituated chiefly towards the blue and violet end. These are caused by\r\nthe increased absorption which the light suffers in the atmosphere, and\r\ngive rise to the preponderating red light on the sun under such\r\nconditions. In the case of the eclipsed moon, the sunbeams have to take\r\nan atmospheric journey more than double as long as that at sunrise or\r\nsunset, and hence the ruddy glow of the eclipsed moon may be accounted\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe almanacs give the full particulars of each eclipse that happens in\r\nthe corresponding year. These predictions are reliable, because\r\nastronomers have been carefully observing the moon for ages, and have\r\nlearned from these observations not only how the moon moves at present,\r\nbut also how it will move for ages to come. The actual calculations are\r\nso complicated that we cannot here discuss them. There is, however, one\r\nleading principle about eclipses which is so simple that we must refer\r\nto it. The eclipses occurring this year have no very obvious relation\r\nto the eclipses that occurred last year, or to those that will occur\r\nnext year. Yet, when we take a more extended view of the sequence of\r\nthese phenomena, a very definite principle becomes manifest. If we\r\nobserve all the eclipses in a period of eighteen years, or nineteen\r\nyears, then we can predict, with at least an approximation to the truth,\r\nall the future eclipses for many years. It is only necessary to\r\nrecollect that in 6,585-1/3 days after one eclipse a nearly similar\r\neclipse follows. For instance, a beautiful eclipse of the moon occurred\r\non the 5th of December, 1881. If we count back 6,585 days from that\r\ndate, or, that is, eighteen years and eleven days, we come to November\r\n24th, 1863, and a similar eclipse of the moon took place then. Again,\r\nthere were four eclipses in the year 1881. If we add 6,585-1/3 days to\r\nthe date of each eclipse, it will give the dates of all the four\r\neclipses in the year 1899. It was this rule which enabled the ancient\r\nastronomers to predict the recurrence of eclipses, at a time when the\r\nmotions of the moon were not understood nearly so well as they now are.\r\n\r\nDuring a long voyage, and perhaps in critical circumstances, the moon\r\nwill often render invaluable information to the sailor. To navigate a\r\nship, suppose from Liverpool to China, the captain must frequently\r\ndetermine the precise position which his ship then occupies. If he could\r\nnot do this, he would never find his way across the trackless ocean.\r\nObservations of the sun give him his latitude and tell him his local\r\ntime, but the captain further requires to know the Greenwich time before\r\nhe can place his finger at a point of the chart and say, \"My ship is\r\nhere.\" To ascertain the Greenwich time the ship carries a chronometer\r\nwhich has been carefully rated before starting, and, as a precaution,\r\ntwo or three chronometers are usually provided to guard against the risk\r\nof error. An unknown error of a minute in the chronometer might perhaps\r\nlead the vessel fifteen miles from its proper course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nCHART OF THE MOON'S SURFACE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Key to Chart of the Moon (Plate VI.).]\r\n\r\nIt is important to have the means of testing the chronometers during the\r\nprogress of the voyage; and it would be a great convenience if every\r\ncaptain, when he wished, could actually consult some infallible standard\r\nof Greenwich time. We want, in fact, a Greenwich clock which may be\r\nvisible over the whole globe. There is such a clock; and, like any other\r\nclock, it has a face on which certain marks are made, and a hand which\r\ntravels round that face. The great clock at Westminster shrinks into\r\ninsignificance when compared with the mighty clock which the captain\r\nuses for setting his chronometer. The face of this stupendous dial is\r\nthe face of the heavens. The numbers engraved on the face of a clock are\r\nreplaced by the twinkling stars; while the hand which moves over the\r\ndial is the beautiful moon herself. When the captain desires to test\r\nhis chronometer, he measures the distance of the moon from a\r\nneighbouring star. For example, he may see that the moon is three\r\ndegrees from the star Regulus. In the Nautical Almanac he finds the\r\nGreenwich time at which the moon was three degrees from Regulus.\r\nComparing this with the indications of the chronometer, he finds the\r\nrequired correction.\r\n\r\nThere is one widely-credited myth about the moon which must be regarded\r\nas devoid of foundation. The idea that our satellite and the weather\r\nbear some relation has no doubt been entertained by high authority, and\r\nappears to be an article in the belief of many an excellent mariner.\r\nCareful comparison between the state of the weather and the phases of\r\nthe moon has, however, quite discredited the notion that any connection\r\nof the kind does really exist.\r\n\r\nWe often notice large blank spaces on maps of Africa and of Australia\r\nwhich indicate our ignorance of parts of the interior of those great\r\ncontinents. We can find no such blank spaces in the map of the moon.\r\nAstronomers know the surface of the moon better than geographers know\r\nthe interior of Africa. Every spot on the face of the moon which is as\r\nlarge as an English parish has been mapped, and all the more important\r\nobjects have been named.\r\n\r\nA general map of the moon is shown in Plate VI. It has been based upon\r\ndrawings made with small telescopes, and it gives an entire view of that\r\nside of our satellite which is presented towards us. The moon is shown\r\nas it appears in an astronomical telescope, which inverts everything, so\r\nthat the south is at the top and the north at the bottom (to show\r\nobjects upright a telescope requires an additional pair of lenses in the\r\neye-piece, and as this diminishes the amount of light reaching the eye\r\nthey are dispensed with in astronomical telescopes). We can see on the\r\nmap some of the characteristic features of lunar scenery. Those dark\r\nregions so conspicuous in the ordinary full moon are easily recognised\r\non the map. They were thought to be seas by astronomers before the days\r\nof telescopes, and indeed the name \"Mare\" is still retained, though it\r\nis obvious that they contain no water at present. The map also shows\r\ncertain ridges or elevated portions, and when we apply measurement to\r\nthese objects we learn that they must be mighty mountain ranges. But the\r\nmost striking features on the moon are those ring-like objects which are\r\nscattered over the surface in profusion. These are known as the lunar\r\ncraters.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate reference to the chief points of interest we have arranged\r\nan index map (Fig. 27) which will give a clue to the names of the\r\nseveral objects depicted upon the plate. The so-called seas are\r\nrepresented by capital letters; so that A is the Mare Crisium, and H the\r\nOceanus Procellarum. The ranges of mountains are indicated by small\r\nletters; thus a on the index is the site of the so-called Caucasus\r\nmountains, and similarly the Apennines are denoted by _c_. The numerous\r\ncraters are distinguished by numbers; for example, the feature on the\r\nmap corresponding to 20 on the index is the crater designated Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n  A. Mare Crisium.\r\n  B.

Triesnecker.\r\n\r\nIn every geographical atlas there is a map showing the two hemispheres\r\nof the earth, the eastern and the western. In the case of the moon we\r\ncan only give a map of one hemisphere, for the simple reason that the\r\nmoon always turns the same side towards us, and accordingly we never get\r\na view of the other side. This is caused by the interesting circumstance\r\nthat the moon takes exactly the same time to turn once round its own\r\naxis as it takes to go once round the earth. The rotation is, however,\r\nperformed with uniform speed, while the moon does not move in its orbit\r\nwith a perfectly uniform velocity (_see_ Chapter IV.). The consequence\r\nis that we now get a slight glimpse round the east limb, and now a\r\nsimilar glimpse round the west limb, as if the moon were shaking its\r\nhead very gently at us. But it is only an insignificant margin of the\r\nfar side of the moon which this _libration_ permits us to examine.\r\n\r\nLunar objects are well suited for observation when the sunlight falls\r\nupon them in such a manner as to exhibit strongly contrasted lights and\r\nshadows. It is impossible to observe the moon satisfactorily when it is\r\nfull, for then no conspicuous shadows are cast. The most opportune\r\nmoment for seeing any particular lunar object is when it lies just at\r\nthe illuminated side of the boundary between light and shade, for then\r\nthe features are brought out with exquisite distinctness.\r\n\r\nPlate VII.[7] gives an illustration of lunar scenery, the object\r\nrepresented being known to astronomers by the name of Triesnecker. The\r\ndistrict included is only a very small fraction of the entire surface of\r\nthe moon, yet the actual area is very considerable, embracing as it does\r\nmany hundreds of square miles. We see in it various ranges of lunar\r\nmountains, while the central object in the picture is one of those\r\nremarkable lunar craters which we meet with so frequently in every lunar\r\nlandscape. This crater is about twenty miles in diameter, and it has a\r\nlofty mountain in the centre, the peak of which is just illuminated by\r\nthe rising sun in that phase of our satellite which is represented in\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\nA typical view of a lunar crater is shown in Plate VIII. This is, no\r\ndoubt, a somewhat imaginary sketch. The point of view from which the\r\nartist is supposed to have taken the picture is one quite unattainable\r\nby terrestrial astronomers, yet there can be little doubt that it is a\r\nfair representation of objects on the moon. We should, however,\r\nrecollect the scale on which it is drawn. The vast crater must be many\r\nmiles across, and the mountain at its centre must be thousands of feet\r\nhigh. The telescope will, even at its best, only show the moon as well\r\nas we could see it with the unaided eye if it were 250 miles away\r\ninstead of being 240,000. We must not, therefore, expect to see any\r\ndetails on the moon even with the finest telescopes, unless they were\r\ncoarse enough to be visible at a distance of 250 miles. England from\r\nsuch a point of view would only show London as a coloured spot, in\r\ncontrast with the general surface of the country.\r\n\r\nWe return, however, from a somewhat fancy sketch to a more prosaic\r\nexamination of what the telescope does actually reveal. Plate IX.\r\nrepresents the large crater Plato, so well known to everyone who uses a\r\ntelescope. The floor of this remarkable object is nearly flat, and the\r\ncentral mountain, so often seen in other craters, is entirely wanting.\r\nWe describe it more fully in the general list of lunar objects.\r\n\r\nThe mountain peaks on the moon throw long, well-defined shadows,\r\ncharacterised by a sharpness which we do not find in the shadows of\r\nterrestrial objects. The difference between the two cases arises from\r\nthe absence of air from the moon. Our atmosphere diffuses a certain\r\namount of light, which mitigates the blackness of terrestrial shadows\r\nand tends to soften their outline. No such influences are at work on the\r\nmoon, and the sharpness of the shadows is taken advantage of in our\r\nattempts to measure the heights of the lunar mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is often easy to compute the altitude of a church steeple, a lofty\r\nchimney, or any similar object, from the length of its shadow. The\r\nsimplest and the most accurate process is to measure at noon the number\r\nof feet from the base of the object to the end of the shadow. The\r\nelevation of the sun at noon on the day in question can be obtained from\r\nthe almanac, and then the height of the object follows by a simple\r\ncalculation. Indeed, if the observations can be made either on the 6th\r\nof April or the 6th of September, at or near the latitude of London,\r\nthen calculations would be unnecessary. The noonday length of the shadow\r\non either of the dates named is equal to the altitude of the object. In\r\nsummer the length of the noontide shadow is less than the altitude; in\r\nwinter the length of the shadow exceeds the altitude. At sunrise or\r\nsunset the shadows are, of course, much longer than at noon, and it is\r\nshadows of this kind that we observe on the moon. The necessary\r\nmeasurements are made by that indispensable adjunct to the equatorial\r\ntelescope known as the _micrometer_.\r\n\r\nThis word denotes an instrument for measuring _small_ distances. In one\r\nsense the term is not a happy one. The objects to which the astronomer\r\napplies the micrometer are usually anything but small. They are\r\ngenerally of the most transcendent dimensions, far exceeding the moon or\r\nthe sun, or even our whole system. Still, the name is not altogether\r\ninappropriate, for, vast though the objects may be, they generally seem\r\nminute, even in the telescope, on account of their great distance.\r\n\r\nWe require for such measurements an instrument capable of the greatest\r\nnicety. Here, again, we invoke the aid of the spider, to whose\r\nassistance in another department we have already referred. In the filar\r\nmicrometer two spider lines are parallel, and one intersects them at\r\nright angles. One or both of the parallel lines can be moved by means of\r\nscrews, the threads of which have been shaped by consummate workmanship.\r\nThe distance through which the line has been moved is accurately\r\nindicated by noting the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution\r\nof the screw. Suppose the two lines be first brought into coincidence,\r\nand then separated until the apparent length of the shadow of the\r\nmountain on the moon is equal to the distance between the lines: we then\r\nknow the number of revolutions of the micrometer screw which is\r\nequivalent to the length of the shadow. The number of miles on the moon\r\nwhich correspond to one revolution of the screw has been previously\r\nascertained by other observations, and hence the length of the shadow\r\ncan be determined. The elevation of the sun, as it would have appeared\r\nto an observer at this point of the moon, at the moment when the\r\nmeasures were being made, is also obtainable, and hence the actual\r\nelevation of the mountain can be calculated. By measurements of this\r\nkind the altitudes of other lunar objects, such, for example, as the\r\nheight of the rampart surrounding a circular-walled plane, can be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and interest of the moon as a telescopic object induces us to\r\ngive to the student a somewhat detailed account of the more remarkable\r\nfeatures which it presents. Most of the objects we are to describe can\r\nbe effectively exhibited with very moderate telescopic power. It is,\r\nhowever, to be remembered that all of them cannot be well seen at one\r\ntime. The region most distinctly shown is the boundary between light and\r\ndarkness. The student will, therefore, select for observation such\r\nobjects as may happen to lie near that boundary at the time when he is\r\nobserving.\r\n\r\n1. _Posidonius._--The diameter of this large crater is nearly 60 miles.\r\nAlthough its surrounding wall is comparatively slender, it is so\r\ndistinctly marked as to make the object very conspicuous. As so\r\nfrequently happens in lunar volcanoes, the bottom of the crater is below\r\nthe level of the surrounding plain, in the present instance to the\r\nextent of nearly 2,500 feet.\r\n\r\n2. _Linné._--This small crater lies in the Mare Serenitatis. About sixty\r\nyears ago it was described as being about 6-1/2 miles in diameter, and\r\nseems to have been sufficiently conspicuous. In 1866 Schmidt, of Athens,\r\nannounced that the crater had disappeared. Since then an exceedingly\r\nsmall shallow depression has been visible, but the whole object is now\r\nvery inconsiderable. This seems to be the most clearly attested case of\r\nchange in a lunar object. Apparently the walls of the crater have\r\ntumbled into the interior and partly filled it up, but many astronomers\r\ndoubt that a change has really taken place, as Schröter, a Hanoverian\r\nobserver at the end of the eighteenth century, appears not to have seen\r\nany conspicuous crater in the place, though it must be admitted that\r\nhis observations are rather incomplete. To give some idea of Schmidt's\r\namazing industry in lunar researches, it may be mentioned that in six\r\nyears he made nearly 57,000 individual settings of his micrometer in the\r\nmeasurement of lunar altitudes. His great chart of the mountains in the\r\nmoon is based on no less than 2,731 drawings and sketches, if those are\r\ncounted twice that may have been used for two divisions of the map.\r\n\r\n3. _Aristotle._--This great philosopher's name has been attached to a\r\ngrand crater 50 miles in diameter, the interior of which, although very\r\nhilly, shows no decidedly marked central cone. But the lofty wall of the\r\ncrater, exceeding 10,500 feet in height, overshadows the floor so\r\ncontinuously that its features are never seen to advantage.\r\n\r\n4. _The Great Valley of the Alps._--A wonderfully straight valley, with\r\na width ranging from 3-1/2 to 6 miles, runs right through the lunar\r\nAlps. It is, according to Mädler, at least 11,500 feet deep, and over 80\r\nmiles in length. A few low ridges which are parallel to the sides of the\r\nvalley may possibly be the result of landslips.\r\n\r\n5. _Aristillus._--Under favourable conditions Lord Rosse's great\r\ntelescope has shown the exterior of this magnificent crater to be scored\r\nwith deep gullies radiating from its centre. Aristillus is about 34\r\nmiles wide and 10,000 feet in depth.\r\n\r\n6. _Autolycus_ is somewhat smaller than the foregoing, to which it forms\r\na companion in accordance with what Mädler thought a well-defined\r\nrelation amongst lunar craters, by which they frequently occurred in\r\npairs, with the smaller one more usually to the south. Towards the edge\r\nthis arrangement is generally rather apparent than real, and is merely a\r\nresult of foreshortening.\r\n\r\n7. _Archimedes._--This large plain, about 50 miles in diameter, has its\r\nvast smooth interior divided by unequally bright streaks into seven\r\ndistinct zones, running east and west. There is no central mountain or\r\nother obvious internal sign of former activity, but its irregular wall\r\nrises into abrupt towers, and is marked outside by decided terraces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE B.\r\n\r\nPORTION OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\n(ALPS, ARCHIMEDES, APENNINES.)\r\n\r\n_Messrs. Loewy & Puiseux_.]\r\n\r\n8. _Plato._--We have already referred to this extensive circular plain,\r\nwhich is noticeable with the smallest telescope. The average height of\r\nthe rampart is about 3,800 feet on the eastern side; the western side is\r\nsomewhat lower, but there is one peak rising to the height of nearly\r\n7,300 feet. The plain girdled by this vast rampart is of ample\r\nproportions. It is a somewhat irregular circle, about 60 miles in\r\ndiameter, and containing an area of 2,700 square miles. On its floor the\r\nshadows of the western wall are shown in Plate IX., as are also three of\r\nthe small craters, of which a large number have been detected by\r\npersevering observers. The narrow sharp line leading from the crater to\r\nthe left is one of those remarkable \"clefts\" which traverse the moon in\r\nso many directions. Another may be seen further to the left. Above Plato\r\nare several detached mountains, the loftiest of which is Pico, about\r\n8,000 feet in height. Its long and pointed shadow would at first sight\r\nlead one to suppose that it must be very steep; but Schmidt, who\r\nspecially studied the inclinations of the lunar slopes, is of opinion\r\nthat it cannot be nearly so steep as many of the Swiss mountains that\r\nare frequently ascended. As many as thirty minute craters have been\r\ncarefully observed on the floor of Plato, and variations have been\r\nthought by Mr. W.H. Pickering to be perceptible.\r\n\r\n9. _Eratosthenes._--This profound crater, upwards of 37 miles in\r\ndiameter, lies at the end of the gigantic range of the Apennines. Not\r\nimprobably, Eratosthenes once formed the volcanic vent for the\r\nstupendous forces that elevated the comparatively craterless peaks of\r\nthese great mountains.\r\n\r\n10. _Copernicus._--Of all the lunar craters this is one of the grandest\r\nand best known. The region to the west is dotted over with innumerable\r\nminute craterlets. It has a central many-peaked mountain about 2,400\r\nfeet in height. There is good reason to believe that the terracing shown\r\nin its interior is mainly due to the repeated alternate rise, partial\r\ncongelation, and subsequent retreat of a vast sea of lava. At full moon\r\nthe crater of Copernicus is seen to be surrounded by radiating streaks.\r\n\r\n11. _Kepler._--Although the internal depth of this crater is scarcely\r\nless than 10,000 feet, it has but a very low surrounding wall, which is\r\nremarkable for being covered with the same glistening substance that\r\nalso forms a system of bright rays not unlike those surrounding the last\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n12. _Aristarchus_ is the most brilliant of the lunar craters, being\r\nspecially vivid with a low power in a large telescope. So bright is it,\r\nindeed, that it has often been seen on the dark side just after new\r\nmoon, and has thus given rise to marvellous stories of active lunar\r\nvolcanoes. To the south-east lies another smaller crater, Herodotus,\r\nnorth of which is a narrow, deep valley, nowhere more than 2-1/2 miles\r\nbroad, which makes a remarkable zigzag. It is one of the largest of the\r\nlunar \"clefts.\"\r\n\r\n13. _Grimaldi_ calls for notice as the darkest object of its size in the\r\nmoon. Under very exceptional circumstances it has been seen with the\r\nnaked eye, and as its area has been estimated at nearly 14,000 square\r\nmiles, it gives an idea of how little unaided vision can discern in the\r\nmoon; it must, however, be added that we always see Grimaldi\r\nconsiderably foreshortened.\r\n\r\n14. The great crater _Gassendi_ has been very frequently mapped on\r\naccount of its elaborate system of \"clefts.\" At its northern end it\r\ncommunicates with a smaller but much deeper crater, that is often filled\r\nwith black shadow after the whole floor of Gassendi has been\r\nilluminated.\r\n\r\n15. _Schickard_ is one of the largest walled plains on the moon, about\r\n134 miles in breadth. Within its vast expanse Mädler detected 23 minor\r\ncraters. With regard to this object Chacornac pointed out that, owing to\r\nthe curvature of the surface of the moon, a spectator at the centre of\r\nthe floor \"would think himself in a boundless desert,\" because the\r\nsurrounding wall, although in one place nearly 10,000 feet high, would\r\nlie entirely beneath his horizon.\r\n\r\n16. Close to the foregoing is _Wargentin_. There can be little doubt\r\nthat this is really a huge crater almost filled with congealed lava, as\r\nthere is scarcely any fall towards the interior.\r\n\r\n17. _Clavius._--Near the 60th parallel of lunar south latitude lies\r\nthis enormous enclosure, the area of which is not less than 16,500\r\nsquare miles. Both in its interior and on its walls are many peaks and\r\nsecondary craters. The telescopic view of a sunrise upon the surface of\r\nClavius is truly said by Mädler to be indescribably magnificent. One of\r\nthe peaks rises to a height of 24,000 feet above the bottom of one of\r\nthe included craters. Mädler even expressed the opinion that in this\r\nwild neighbourhood there are craters so profound that no ray of sunlight\r\never penetrated their lowest depths, while, as if in compensation, there\r\nare peaks whose summits enjoy a mean day almost twice as long as their\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n18. If the full moon be viewed through an opera-glass or any small\r\nhand-telescope, one crater is immediately seen to be conspicuous beyond\r\nall others, by reason of the brilliant rays or streaks that radiate from\r\nit. This is the majestic _Tycho_, 17,000 feet in depth and 50 miles in\r\ndiameter (Plate X.). A peak 6,000 feet in height rises in the centre of\r\nits floor, while a series of terraces diversity its interior slopes; but\r\nit is the mysterious bright rays that chiefly surprise us. When the sun\r\nrises on Tycho, these streaks are utterly invisible; indeed, the whole\r\nobject is then so obscure that it requires a practised eye to recognise\r\nTycho amidst its mountainous surroundings. But as soon as the sun has\r\nattained a height of about 30° above its horizon, the rays emerge from\r\ntheir obscurity and gradually increase in brightness until the moon\r\nbecomes full, when they are the most conspicuous objects on her surface.\r\nThey vary in length, from a few hundred miles to two or, in one\r\ninstance, nearly three thousand miles. They extend indifferently across\r\nvast plains, into the deepest craters, or over the loftiest elevations.\r\nWe know of nothing on our earth to which they can be compared. As these\r\nrays are only seen about the time of full moon, their visibility\r\nobviously depends on the light falling more or less closely in the line\r\nof sight, quite regardless of the inclination of the surfaces, mountains\r\nor valleys, on which they appear. Each small portion of the surface of\r\nthe streak must therefore be of a form which is symmetrical to the\r\nspectator from whatever point it is seen. The sphere alone appears to\r\nfulfil this condition, and Professor Copeland therefore suggests that\r\nthe material constituting the surface of the streak must be made up of a\r\nlarge number of more or less completely spherical globules. The streaks\r\nmust represent parts of the lunar surface either pitted with minute\r\ncavities of spherical figure, or strewn over with minute transparent\r\nspheres.[8]\r\n\r\nNear the centre of the moon's disc is a fine range of ring plains fully\r\nopen to our view under all illuminations. Of these, two may be\r\nmentioned--_Alphonsus_ (19), the floor of which is strangely\r\ncharacterised by two bright and several dark markings which cannot be\r\nexplained by irregularities in the surface.--_Ptolemy_ (20). Besides\r\nseveral small enclosed craters, its floor is crossed by numerous low\r\nridges, visible when the sun is rising or setting.\r\n\r\n21, 22, 23.--When the moon is five or six days old this beautiful group\r\nof three craters will be favourably placed for observation. They are\r\nnamed _Catharina_, _Cyrillus_, and _Theophilus_. Catharina, the most\r\nsoutherly of the group, is more than 16,000 feet deep, and connected\r\nwith Cyrillus by a wide valley; but between Cyrillus and Theophilus\r\nthere is no such connection. Indeed, Cyrillus looks as if its huge\r\nsurrounding ramparts, as high as Mont Blanc, had been completely\r\nfinished before the volcanic forces commenced the formation of\r\nTheophilus, the rampart of which encroaches considerably on its older\r\nneighbour. Theophilus stands as a well-defined circular crater about 64\r\nmiles in diameter, with an internal depth of 14,000 to 18,000 feet, and\r\na beautiful central group of mountains, one-third of that height, on its\r\nfloor. Although Theophilus is the deepest crater we can see in the moon,\r\nit has suffered little or no deformation from secondary eruptions, while\r\nthe floor and wall of Catharina show complete sequences of lesser\r\ncraters of various sizes that have broken in upon and partly destroyed\r\neach other. In the spring of the year, when the moon is somewhat before\r\nthe first quarter, this instructive group of extinct volcanoes can be\r\nseen to great advantage at a convenient hour in the evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nTRIESNECKER.\r\n\r\n(AFTER NASMYTH.)]\r\n\r\n24. _Petavius_ is remarkable not only for its great size, but also for\r\nthe rare feature of having a double rampart. It is a beautiful object\r\nsoon after new moon, or just after full moon, but disappears absolutely\r\nwhen the sun is more than 45° above its horizon. The crater floor is\r\nremarkably convex, culminating in a central group of hills intersected\r\nby a deep cleft.\r\n\r\n25. _Hyginus_ is a small crater near the centre of the moon's disc. One\r\nof the largest of the lunar chasms passes right through it, making an\r\nabrupt turn as it does so.\r\n\r\n26. _Triesnecker._--This fine crater has been already described, but is\r\nagain alluded to in order to draw attention to the elaborate system of\r\nchasms so conspicuously shown in Plate VII. That these chasms are\r\ndepressions is abundantly evident by the shadows inside. Very often\r\ntheir margins are appreciably raised. They seem to be fractures in the\r\nmoon's surface.\r\n\r\nOf the various mountains that are occasionally seen as projections on\r\nthe actual edge of the moon, those called after Leibnitz (_i_) seem to\r\nbe the highest. Schmidt found the highest peak to be upwards of 41,900\r\nfeet above a neighbouring valley. In comparing these altitudes with\r\nthose of mountains on our earth, we must for the latter add the depth of\r\nthe sea to the height of the land. Reckoned in this way, our highest\r\nmountains are still higher than any we know of in the moon.\r\n\r\nWe must now discuss the important question as to the origin of these\r\nremarkable features on the surface of the moon. We shall admit at the\r\noutset that our evidence on this subject is only indirect. To establish\r\nby unimpeachable evidence the volcanic origin of the remarkable lunar\r\ncraters, it would seem almost necessary that volcanic outbursts should\r\nhave been witnessed on the moon, and that such outbursts should have\r\nbeen seen to result in the formation of the well-known ring, with or\r\nwithout the mountain rising from the centre. To say that nothing of the\r\nkind has ever been witnessed would be rather too emphatic a statement.\r\nOn certain occasions careful observers have reported the occurrence of\r\nminute local changes on the moon. As we have already remarked, a crater\r\nnamed Linné, of dimensions respectable, no doubt, to a lunar inhabitant,\r\nbut forming a very inconsiderable telescopic object, was thought to have\r\nundergone some change. On another occasion a minute crater was thought\r\nto have arisen near the well-known object named Hyginus. The mere\r\nenumeration of such instances gives real emphasis to the statement that\r\nthere is at the present time no appreciable source of disturbance of the\r\nmoon's surface. Even were these trifling cases of suspected change\r\nreally established--and this is perhaps rather farther than many\r\nastronomers would be willing to go--they are still insignificant when\r\ncompared with the mighty phenomena that gave rise to the host of great\r\ncraters which cover so large a portion of the moon's surface.\r\n\r\nWe are led inevitably to the conclusion that our satellite must have\r\nonce possessed much greater activity than it now displays. We can also\r\ngive a reasonable, or, at all events, a plausible, explanation of the\r\ncessation of that activity in recent times. Let us glance at two other\r\nbodies of our system, the earth and the sun, and compare them with the\r\nmoon. Of the three bodies, the sun is enormously the largest, while the\r\nmoon is much less than the earth. We have also seen that though the sun\r\nmust have a very high temperature, there can be no doubt that it is\r\ngradually parting with its heat. The surface of the earth, formed as it\r\nis of solid rocks and clay, or covered in great part by the vast expanse\r\nof ocean, bears but few obvious traces of a high temperature.\r\nNevertheless, it is highly probable from ordinary volcanic phenomena\r\nthat the interior of the earth still possesses a temperature of\r\nincandescence.\r\n\r\nA large body when heated takes a longer time to cool than does a small\r\nbody raised to the same temperature. A large iron casting will take days\r\nto cool; a small casting will become cold in a few hours. Whatever may\r\nhave been the original source of heat in our system--a question which\r\nwe are not now discussing--it seems demonstrable that the different\r\nbodies were all originally heated, and have now for ages been gradually\r\ncooling. The sun is so vast that he has not yet had time to cool; the\r\nearth, of intermediate bulk, has become cold on the outside, while still\r\nretaining vast stores of internal heat; while the moon, the smallest\r\nbody of all, has lost its heat to such an extent that changes of\r\nimportance on its surface can no longer be originated by internal fires.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to refer the origin of the lunar craters to some ancient\r\nepoch in the moon's history. We have no moans of knowing the remoteness\r\nof that epoch, but it is reasonable to surmise that the antiquity of the\r\nlunar volcanoes must be extremely great. At the time when the moon was\r\nsufficiently heated to originate those convulsions, of which the mighty\r\ncraters are the survivals, the earth must also have been much hotter\r\nthan it is at present. When the moon possessed sufficient heat for its\r\nvolcanoes to be active, the earth was probably so hot that life was\r\nimpossible on its surface. This supposition would point to an antiquity\r\nfor the lunar craters far too great to be estimated by the centuries and\r\nthe thousands of years which are adequate for such periods as those with\r\nwhich the history of human events is concerned. It seems not unlikely\r\nthat millions of years may have elapsed since the mighty craters of\r\nPlato or of Copernicus consolidated into their present form.\r\n\r\nWe shall now attempt to account for the formation of the lunar craters.\r\nThe most probable views on the subject seem to be those which have been\r\nset forth by Mr. Nasmyth, though it must be admitted that his doctrines\r\nare by no means free from difficulty. According to his theory we can\r\nexplain how the rampart around the lunar crater has been formed, and how\r\nthe great mountain arose which so often adorns the centre of the plain.\r\nThe view in Fig. 28 contains an imaginary sketch of a volcanic vent on\r\nthe moon in the days when the craters were active. The eruption is here\r\nshown in the fulness of its energy, when the internal forces are hurling\r\nforth ashes or stones which fall at a considerable distance from the\r\nvent. The materials thus accumulated constitute the rampart surrounding\r\nthe crater.\r\n\r\nThe second picture (Fig. 29) depicts the crater in a later stage of its\r\nhistory. The prodigious explosive power has now been exhausted, and has\r\nperhaps been intermitted for some time. Again, the volcano bursts into\r\nactivity, but this time with only a small part of its original energy. A\r\ncomparatively feeble eruption now issues from the same vent, deposits\r\nmaterials close around the orifice, and raises a mountain in the centre.\r\nFinally, when the activity has subsided, and the volcano is silent and\r\nstill, we find the evidence of the early energy testified to by the\r\nrampart which surrounds the ancient crater, and by the mountain which\r\nadorns the interior. The flat floor which is found in some of the\r\ncraters may not improbably have arisen from an outflow of lava which has\r\nafterwards consolidated. Subsequent outbreaks have also occurred in many\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal difficulties attending this method of accounting\r\nfor the structure of a crater arises from the great size which some of\r\nthese objects attain. There are ancient volcanoes on the moon forty or\r\nfifty miles in diameter; indeed, there is one well-formed ring, with a\r\nmountain rising in the centre, the diameter of which is no less than\r\nseventy-eight miles (Petavius). It seems difficult to conceive how a\r\nblowing cone at the centre could convey the materials to such a distance\r\nas the thirty-nine miles between the centre of Petavius and the rampart.\r\nThe explanation is, however, facilitated when it is borne in mind that\r\nthe force of gravitation is much less on the moon than on the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nA NORMAL LUNAR CRATER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Volcano in Activity.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Subsequent Feeble Activity.]\r\n\r\nHave we not already seen that our satellite is so much smaller than the\r\nearth that eighty moons rolled into one would not weigh as much as the\r\nearth? On the earth an ounce weighs an ounce and a pound weighs a pound;\r\nbut a weight of six ounces here would only weigh one ounce on the moon,\r\nand a weight of six pounds here would only weigh one pound on the moon.\r\nA labourer who can carry one sack of corn on the earth could, with the\r\nsame exertion, carry six sacks of corn on the moon. A cricketer who can\r\nthrow a ball 100 yards on the earth could with precisely the same\r\nexertion throw the same ball 600 yards on the moon. Hiawatha could shoot\r\nten arrows into the air one after the other before the first reached\r\nthe ground; on the moon he might have emptied his whole quiver. The\r\nvolcano, which on the moon drove projectiles to the distance of\r\nthirty-nine miles, need only possess the same explosive power as would\r\nhave been sufficient to drive the missiles six or seven miles on the\r\nearth. A modern cannon properly elevated would easily achieve this feat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Formation of the Level Floor by Lava.]\r\n\r\nIt must also be borne in mind that there are innumerable craters on the\r\nmoon of the same general type but of the most varied dimensions; from a\r\ntiny telescopic object two or three miles in diameter, we can point out\r\ngradually ascending stages until we reach the mighty Petavius just\r\nconsidered. With regard to the smaller craters, there is obviously\r\nlittle or no difficulty in attributing to them a volcanic origin, and as\r\nthe continuity from the smallest to the largest craters is unbroken, it\r\nseems quite reasonable to suppose that even the greatest has arisen in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be remarked that some lunar features might be\r\nexplained by actions from without rather than from within. Mr. G.K.\r\nGilbert has marshalled the evidence in support of the belief that lunar\r\nsculptures arise from the impact of bodies falling on the moon. The Mare\r\nImbrium, according to this view, has been the seat of a collision to\r\nwhich the surrounding lunar scenery is due. Mr. Gilbert explains the\r\nfurrows as hewn out by mighty projectiles moving with such velocities as\r\nmeteors possess.\r\n\r\nThe lunar landscapes are excessively weird and rugged. They always\r\nremind us of sterile deserts, and we cannot fail to notice the absence\r\nof grassy plains or green forests such as we are familiar with on our\r\nglobe. In some respects the moon is not very differently circumstanced\r\nfrom the earth. Like it, the moon has the pleasing alternations of day\r\nand night, though the day in the moon is as long as twenty-nine of our\r\ndays, and the night of the moon is as long as twenty-nine of our nights.\r\nWe are warmed by the rays of the sun; so, too, is the moon; but,\r\nwhatever may be the temperature during the long day on the moon, it\r\nseems certain that the cold of the lunar night would transcend that\r\nknown in the bleakest regions of our earth. The amount of heat radiated\r\nto us by the moon has been investigated by Lord Rosse, and more recently\r\nby Professor Langley. Though every point on the moon's surface is\r\nexposed to the sunlight for a fortnight without any interruption, the\r\nactual temperature to which the soil is raised cannot be a high one. The\r\nmoon does not, like the earth, possess a warm blanket, in the shape of\r\nan atmosphere, which can keep in and accumulate the heat received.\r\n\r\nEven our largest telescopes can tell nothing directly as to whether life\r\ncan exist on the moon. The mammoth trees of California might be growing\r\non the lunar mountains, and elephants might be walking about on the\r\nplains, but our telescopes could not show them. The smallest object that\r\nwe can see on the moon must be about as large as a good-sized cathedral,\r\nso that organised beings resembling in size any that we are familiar\r\nwith, if they existed, could not make themselves visible as telescopic\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore compelled to resort to indirect evidence as to whether\r\nlife would be possible on the moon. We may say at once that astronomers\r\nbelieve that life, as we know it, could not exist. Among the necessary\r\nconditions of life, water is one of the first. Take every form of\r\nvegetable life, from the lichen which grows on the rock to the giant\r\ntree of the forest, and we find the substance of every plant contains\r\nwater, and could not exist without it. Nor is water less necessary to\r\nthe existence of animal life. Deprived of this element, all organic\r\nlife, the life of man himself, would be inconceivable.\r\n\r\nUnless, therefore, water be present in the moon, we shall be bound to\r\nconclude that life, as we know it, is impossible. If anyone stationed on\r\nthe moon were to look at the earth through a telescope, would he be able\r\nto see any water here? Most undoubtedly he would. He would see the\r\nclouds and he would notice their incessant changes, and the clouds alone\r\nwould be almost conclusive evidence of the existence of water. An\r\nastronomer on the moon would also see our oceans as coloured surfaces,\r\nremarkably contrasted with the land, and he would perhaps frequently see\r\nan image of the sun, like a brilliant star, reflected from some smooth\r\nportion of the sea. In fact, considering that much more than half of our\r\nglobe is covered with oceans, and that most of the remainder is liable\r\nto be obscured by clouds, the lunar astronomer in looking at our earth\r\nwould often see hardly anything but water in one form or other. Very\r\nlikely he would come to the conclusion that our globe was only fitted to\r\nbe a residence for amphibious animals.\r\n\r\nBut when we look at the moon with our telescopes we see no direct\r\nevidence of water. Close inspection shows that the so-called lunar seas\r\nare deserts, often marked with small craters and rocks. The telescope\r\nreveals no seas and no oceans, no lakes and no rivers. Nor is the\r\ngrandeur of the moon's scenery ever impaired by clouds over her surface.\r\nWhenever the moon is above our horizon, and terrestrial clouds are out\r\nof the way, we can see the features of our satellite's surface with\r\ndistinctness. There are no clouds in the moon; there are not even the\r\nmists or the vapours which invariably arise wherever water is present,\r\nand therefore astronomers have been led to the conclusion that the\r\nsurface of the globe which attends the earth is a sterile and a\r\nwaterless desert.\r\n\r\nAnother essential element of organic life is also absent from the moon.\r\nOur globe is surrounded with a deep clothing of air resting on the\r\nsurface, and extending above our heads to the height of about 200 or 300\r\nmiles. We need hardly say how necessary air is to life, and therefore we\r\nturn with interest to the question as to whether the moon can be\r\nsurrounded with an atmosphere. Let us clearly understand the problem we\r\nare about to consider. Imagine that a traveller started from the earth\r\non a journey to the moon; as he proceeded, the air would gradually\r\nbecome more and more rarefied, until at length, when he was a few\r\nhundred miles above the earth's surface, he would have left the last\r\nperceptible traces of the earth's envelope behind him. By the time he\r\nhad passed completely through the atmosphere he would have advanced only\r\na very small fraction of the whole journey of 240,000 miles, and there\r\nwould still remain a vast void to be traversed before the moon would be\r\nreached. If the moon were enveloped in the same way as the earth, then,\r\nas the traveller approached the end of his journey, and came within a\r\nfew hundred miles of the moon's surface, he would meet again with traces\r\nof an atmosphere, which would gradually increase in density until he\r\narrived at the moon's surface. The traveller would thus have passed\r\nthrough one stratum of air at the beginning of his journey, and through\r\nanother at the end, while the main portion of the voyage would have been\r\nthrough space more void than that to be found in the exhausted receiver\r\nof an air-pump.\r\n\r\nSuch would be the case if the moon were coated with an atmosphere like\r\nthat surrounding our earth. But what are the facts? The traveller as he\r\ndrew near the moon would seek in vain for air to breathe at all\r\nresembling ours. It is possible that close to the surface there are\r\nfaint traces of some gaseous material surrounding the moon, but it can\r\nonly be equal to a very small fractional part of the ample clothing\r\nwhich the earth now enjoys. For all purposes of respiration, as we\r\nunderstand the term, we may say that there is no air on the moon, and an\r\ninhabitant of our earth transferred thereto would be as certainly\r\nsuffocated as he would be in the middle of space.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be asked how we learn this. Is not air transparent, and\r\nhow, therefore, could our telescopes be expected to show whether the\r\nmoon really possessed such an envelope? It is by indirect, but\r\nthoroughly reliable, methods of observation that we learn the destitute\r\ncondition of our satellite. There are various arguments to be adduced;\r\nbut the most conclusive is that obtained on the occurrence of what is\r\ncalled an \"occultation.\" It sometimes happens that the moon comes\r\ndirectly between the earth and a star, and the temporary extinction of\r\nthe latter is an \"occultation.\" We can observe the moment when the\r\nphenomenon takes place, and the suddenness of the disappearance of the\r\nstar is generally remarked. If the moon were enveloped in a copious\r\natmosphere, the interposition of this gaseous mass by the movement of\r\nthe moon would produce a gradual evanescence of the star wholly wanting\r\nthe abruptness which marks the obscuration.[9]\r\n\r\nLet us consider how we can account for the absence of an atmosphere from\r\nthe moon. What we call a gas has been found by modern research to be a\r\ncollection of an immense number of molecules, each of which is in\r\nexceedingly rapid motion. This motion is only pursued for a short\r\ndistance in one direction before a molecule comes into collision with\r\nsome other molecule, whereby the directions and velocities of the\r\nindividual molecules are continually changed. There is a certain average\r\nspeed for each gas which is peculiar to the molecules of that gas at a\r\ncertain temperature. When several gases are mixed, as oxygen and\r\nnitrogen are in our atmosphere, the molecules of each gas continue to\r\nmove with their own characteristic velocities. So far as we can estimate\r\nthe temperature at the boundary of the earth's atmosphere, we may assume\r\nthat the average of the velocities of the oxygen molecules there found\r\nis about a quarter of a mile per second. The velocities for nitrogen are\r\nmuch the same, while the average speed of a molecule of hydrogen is\r\nabout one mile per second, being, in fact, by far the greatest molecular\r\nvelocity possessed by any gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nPLATO.\r\n\r\n(AFTER NASMYTH.)]\r\n\r\nA stone thrown into the air soon regains the earth. A rifle bullet\r\nfired vertically upwards will ascend higher and higher, until at length\r\nits motion ceases, it begins to return, and falls to the ground. Let us\r\nfor the moment suppose that we had a rifle of infinite strength and\r\ngunpowder of unlimited power. As we increase the charge we find that the\r\nbullet will ascend higher and higher, and each time it will take a\r\nlonger period before it returns to the ground. The descent of the bullet\r\nis due to the attraction of the earth. Gravitation must necessarily act\r\non the projectile throughout its career, and it gradually lessens the\r\nvelocity, overcomes the upward motion, and brings the bullet back. It\r\nmust be remembered that the efficiency of the attraction decreases when\r\nthe height is increased. Consequently when the body has a prodigiously\r\ngreat initial velocity, in consequence of which it ascends to an\r\nenormous height, its return is retarded by a twofold cause. In the first\r\nplace, the distance through which it has to be recalled is greatly\r\nincreased, and in the second place the efficiency of gravitation in\r\neffecting its recall has decreased. The greater the velocity, the\r\nfeebler must be the capacity of gravitation for bringing back the body.\r\nWe can conceive the speed to be increased to that point at which the\r\ngravitation, constantly declining as the body ascends, is never quite\r\nable to neutralise the velocity, and hence we have the remarkable case\r\nof a body projected away never to return.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to exhibit this reasoning in a numerical form, and to\r\nshow that a velocity of six or seven miles a second directed upwards\r\nwould suffice to convey a body entirely away from the gravitation of the\r\nearth. This speed is far beyond the utmost limits of our artillery. It\r\nis, indeed, at least a dozen times as swift as a cannon shot; and even\r\nif we could produce it, the resistance of the air would present an\r\ninsuperable difficulty. Such reflections, however, do not affect the\r\nconclusion that there is for each planet a certain specific velocity\r\nappropriate to that body, and depending solely upon its size and mass,\r\nwith which we should have to discharge a projectile, in order to prevent\r\nthe attraction of that body from pulling the projectile back again.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple matter of calculation to determine this \"critical\r\nvelocity\" for any celestial body. The greater the body the greater in\r\ngeneral must be the initial speed which will enable the projectile to\r\nforsake for ever the globe from which it has been discharged. As we\r\nhave already indicated, this speed is about seven miles per second on\r\nthe earth. It would be three on the planet Mercury, three and a half on\r\nMars, twenty-two on Saturn, and thirty-seven on Jupiter; while for a\r\nmissile to depart from the sun without prospect of return, it must leave\r\nthe brilliant surface at a speed not less than 391 miles per second.\r\n\r\nSupposing that a quantity of free hydrogen was present in our\r\natmosphere, its molecules would move with an average velocity of about\r\none mile per second. It would occasionally happen by a combination of\r\ncircumstances that a molecule would attain a speed which exceeded seven\r\nmiles a second. If this happened on the confines of the atmosphere where\r\nit escaped collision with other molecules, the latter object would fly\r\noff into space, and would not be recaptured by the earth. By incessant\r\nrepetitions of this process, in the course of countless ages, all the\r\nmolecules of hydrogen gas would escape from the earth, and in this\r\nmanner we may explain the fact that there is no free hydrogen present in\r\nthe earth's atmosphere.[10]\r\n\r\nThe velocities which can be attained by the molecules of gases other\r\nthan hydrogen are far too small to permit of their escape from the\r\nattraction of the earth. We therefore find oxygen, nitrogen, water\r\nvapour, and carbon dioxide remaining as permanent components of our air.\r\nOn the other hand, the enormous mass of the sun makes the \"critical\r\nvelocity\" at the surface of that body to be so great (391 miles per\r\nsecond) that not even the molecules of hydrogen can possibly emulate it.\r\nConsequently, as we have seen, hydrogen is a most important component of\r\nthe sun's atmospheric envelope.\r\n\r\nIf we now apply this reasoning to the moon, the critical velocity is\r\nfound by calculation to be only a mile and a half per second. This seems\r\nto be well within the maximum velocities attainable by the molecules of\r\noxygen, nitrogen, and other gases. It therefore follows that none of\r\nthese gases could remain permanently to form an atmosphere at the\r\nsurface of so small a body as the moon. This seems to be the reason why\r\nthere are no present traces of any distinct gaseous surroundings to our\r\nsatellite.\r\n\r\nThe absence of air and of water from the moon explains the sublime\r\nruggedness of the lunar scenery. We know that on the earth the action of\r\nwind and of rain, of frost and of snow, is constantly tending to wear\r\ndown our mountains and reduce their asperities. No such agents are at\r\nwork on the moon. Volcanoes sculptured the surface into its present\r\ncondition, and, though they have ceased to operate for ages, the traces\r\nof their handiwork seem nearly as fresh to-day as they were when the\r\nmighty fires were extinguished.\r\n\r\n\"The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples\" have\r\nbut a brief career on earth. It is chiefly the incessant action of water\r\nand of air that makes them vanish like the \"baseless fabric of a\r\nvision.\" On the moon these causes of disintegration and of decay are all\r\nabsent, though perhaps the changes of temperature in the transition from\r\nlunar day to lunar night would be attended with expansions and\r\ncontractions that might compensate in some slight degree for the absence\r\nof more potent agents of dissolution.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that a building on the moon would remain for century\r\nafter century just as it was left by the builders. There need be no\r\nglass in the windows, for there is no wind and no rain to keep out.\r\nThere need not be fireplaces in the rooms, for fuel cannot burn without\r\nair. Dwellers in a lunar city would find that no dust could rise, no\r\nodours be perceived, no sounds be heard.\r\n\r\nMan is a creature adapted for life under circumstances which are very\r\nnarrowly limited. A few degrees of temperature more or less, a slight\r\nvariation in the composition of air, the precise suitability of food,\r\nmake all the difference between health and sickness, between life and\r\ndeath. Looking beyond the moon, into the length and breadth of the\r\nuniverse, we find countless celestial globes with every conceivable\r\nvariety of temperature and of constitution. Amid this vast number of\r\nworlds with which space is tenanted, are there any inhabited by living\r\nbeings? To this great question science can make no response: we cannot\r\ntell. Yet it is impossible to resist a conjecture. We find our earth\r\nteeming with life in every part. We find life under the most varied\r\nconditions that can be conceived. It is met with under the burning heat\r\nof the tropics and in the everlasting frost at the poles. We find life\r\nin caves where not a ray of light ever penetrates. Nor is it wanting in\r\nthe depths of the ocean, at the pressure of tons on the square inch.\r\nWhatever may be the external circumstances, Nature generally provides\r\nsome form of life to which those circumstances are congenial.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all probable that among the million spheres of the universe\r\nthere is a single one exactly like our earth--like it in the possession\r\nof air and of water, like it in size and in composition. It does not\r\nseem probable that a man could live for one hour on any body in the\r\nuniverse except the earth, or that an oak-tree could live in any other\r\nsphere for a single season. Men can dwell on the earth, and oak-trees\r\ncan thrive therein, because the constitutions of the man and of the oak\r\nare specially adapted to the particular circumstances of the earth.\r\n\r\nCould we obtain a closer view of some of the celestial bodies, we should\r\nprobably find that they, too, teem with life, but with life specially\r\nadapted to the environment--life in forms strange and weird; life far\r\nstranger to us than Columbus found it to be in the New World when he\r\nfirst landed there. Life, it may be, stranger than ever Dante described\r\nor Doré sketched. Intelligence may also have a home among those spheres\r\nno less than on the earth. There are globes greater and globes\r\nless--atmospheres greater and atmospheres less. The truest philosophy on\r\nthis subject is crystallised in the language of Tennyson:--\r\n\r\n  \"This truth within thy mind rehearse,\r\n  That in a boundless universe\r\n  Is boundless better, boundless worse.\r\n\r\n  \"Think you this mould of hopes and fears\r\n  Could find no statelier than his peers\r\n  In yonder hundred million spheres?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\nTYCHO AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.\r\n\r\n(AFTER NASMYTH.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Exceptional Importance of the Sun and Moon--The Course to be\r\n     pursued--The Order of Distance--The Neighbouring Orbs--How are they\r\n     to be discriminated?--The Planets Venus and Jupiter attract Notice\r\n     by their Brilliancy--Sirius not a Neighbour--The Planets Saturn and\r\n     Mercury--Telescopic Planets--The Criterion as to whether a Body is\r\n     to be ranked as a Neighbour--Meaning of the word _Planet_--Uranus\r\n     and Neptune--Comets--The Planets are illuminated by the Sun--The\r\n     Stars are not--The Earth is really a Planet--The Four Inner\r\n     Planets, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars--Velocity of the\r\n     Earth--The Outer Planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune--Light\r\n     and Heat received by the Planets from the Sun--Comparative Sizes of\r\n     the Planets--The Minor Planets--The Planets all revolve in the same\r\n     Direction--The Solar System--An Island Group in Space.\r\n\r\nIn the two preceding chapters of this work we have endeavoured to\r\ndescribe the heavenly bodies in the order of their relative importance\r\nto mankind. Could we doubt for a moment as to which of the many orbs in\r\nthe universe should be the first to receive our attention? We do not now\r\nallude to the intrinsic significance of the sun when compared with other\r\nbodies or groups of bodies scattered through space. It may be that\r\nnumerous globes rival the sun in real splendour, in bulk, and in mass.\r\nWe shall, in fact, show later on in this volume that this is the case;\r\nand we shall then be in a position to indicate the true rank of the sun\r\namid the countless hosts of heaven. But whatever may be the importance\r\nof the sun, viewed merely as one of the bodies which teem through space,\r\nthere can be no hesitation in asserting how immeasurably his influence\r\non the earth surpasses that of all other bodies in the universe\r\ntogether. It was therefore natural--indeed inevitable--that our first\r\nexamination of the orbs of heaven should be directed to that mighty body\r\nwhich is the source of our life itself.\r\n\r\nNor could there be much hesitation as to the second step which ought to\r\nbe taken. The intrinsic importance of the moon, when compared with other\r\ncelestial bodies, may be small; it is, indeed, as we shall afterwards\r\nsee, almost infinitesimal. But in the economy of our earth the moon has\r\nplayed, and still plays, a part second only in importance to that of the\r\nsun himself. The moon is so close to us that her brilliant rays pale to\r\ninvisibility countless orbs of a size and an intrinsic splendour\r\nincomparably greater than her own. The moon also occupies an exceptional\r\nposition in the history of astronomy; for the law of gravitation, the\r\ngreatest discovery that science has yet witnessed, was chiefly\r\naccomplished by observations of the moon. It was therefore natural that\r\nan early chapter in our Story of the Heavens should be devoted to a body\r\nthe interest of which approximated so closely to that of the sun\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut the sun and the moon having been partly described (we shall\r\nafterwards have to refer to them again), some hesitation is natural in\r\nthe choice of the next step. The two great luminaries being abstracted\r\nfrom our view, there remains no other celestial body of such exceptional\r\ninterest and significance as to make it quite clear what course to\r\npursue; we desire to unfold the story of the heavens in the most natural\r\nmanner. If we made the attempt to describe the celestial bodies in the\r\norder of their actual magnitude, our ignorance must at once pronounce\r\nthe task to be impossible. We cannot even make a conjecture as to which\r\nbody in the heavens is to stand first on the list. Even if that\r\nmightiest body be within reach of our telescopes (in itself a highly\r\nimprobable supposition), we have not the least idea in what part of the\r\nheavens it is to be sought. And even if this were possible--if we were\r\nable to arrange all the visible bodies rank by rank in the order of\r\ntheir magnitude and their splendour--still the scheme would be\r\nimpracticable, for of most of them we know little or nothing.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore compelled to adopt a different method of procedure, and\r\nthe simplest, as well as the most natural, will be to follow as far as\r\npossible the order of distance of the different bodies. We have already\r\nspoken of the moon as the nearest neighbour to the earth; we shall next\r\nconsider some of the other celestial bodies which are comparatively near\r\nto us; then, as the subject unfolds, we shall discuss the objects\r\nfurther and further away, until towards the close of the volume we shall\r\nbe engaged in considering the most distant bodies in the universe which\r\nthe telescope has yet revealed to us.\r\n\r\nEven when we have decided on this principle, our course is still not\r\nfree from ambiguity. Many of the bodies in the heavens are in motion, so\r\nthat their relative distances from the earth are in continual change;\r\nthis is, however, a difficulty which need not detain us. We shall make\r\nno attempt to adhere closely to the principle in all details. It will be\r\nsufficient if we first describe those great bodies--not a very numerous\r\nclass--which are, comparatively speaking, in our vicinity, though still\r\nat varied distances; and then we shall pass on to the uncounted bodies\r\nwhich are separated from us by distances so vast that the imagination is\r\nbaffled in the attempt to realise them.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, scan the heavens to discover those orbs which lie in our\r\nneighbourhood. The sun has set, the moon has not risen; a cloudless sky\r\ndiscloses a heaven glittering with countless gems of light. Some are\r\ngrouped together into well-marked constellations; others seem scattered\r\npromiscuously, with every degree of lustre, from the very brightest down\r\nto the faintest point that the eye can just glimpse. Amid all this host\r\nof objects, how are we to identify those which lie nearest to the earth?\r\nLook to the west: and there, over the spot where the departing sunbeams\r\nstill linger, we often see the lovely evening star shining forth. This\r\nis the planet Venus--a beauteous orb, twin-sister to the earth. The\r\nbrilliancy of this planet, its rapid changes both in position and in\r\nlustre, would suggest at once that it was much nearer to the earth than\r\nother star-like objects. This presumption has been amply confirmed by\r\ncareful measurements, and therefore Venus is to be included in the list\r\nof the orbs which constitute our neighbours.\r\n\r\nAnother conspicuous planet--almost rivalling Venus in lustre, and\r\nvastly surpassing Venus in the magnificence of its proportions and its\r\nretinue--has borne from antiquity the majestic name of Jupiter. No doubt\r\nJupiter is much more distant from us than Venus. Indeed, he is always at\r\nleast twice as far, and sometimes as much as ten times. But still we\r\nmust include Jupiter among our neighbours. Compared with the host of\r\nstars which glitter on the heavens, Jupiter must be regarded as quite\r\ncontiguous. The distance of the great planet requires, it is true,\r\nhundreds of millions of miles for its expression; yet, vast as is that\r\ndistance, it would have to be multiplied by tens of thousands, or\r\nhundreds of thousands, before it would be long enough to span the abyss\r\nwhich intervenes between the earth and the nearest of the stars.\r\n\r\nVenus and Jupiter have invited our attention by their exceptional\r\nbrilliancy. We should, however, fall into error if we assumed generally\r\nthat the brightest objects were those nearest to the earth. An observer\r\nunacquainted with astronomy might not improbably point to the Dog\r\nStar--or Sirius, as astronomers more generally know it--as an object\r\nwhose exceptional lustre showed it to be one of our neighbours. This,\r\nhowever, would be a mistake. We shall afterwards have occasion to refer\r\nmore particularly to this gem of our southern skies, and then it will\r\nappear that Sirius is a mighty globe far transcending our own sun in\r\nsize as well as in splendour, but plunged into the depths of space to\r\nsuch an appalling distance that his enfeebled rays, when they reach the\r\nearth, give us the impression, not of a mighty sun, but only of a\r\nbrilliant star.\r\n\r\nThe principle of selection, by which the earth's neighbours can be\r\ndiscriminated, will be explained presently; in the meantime, it will be\r\nsufficient to observe that our list is to be augmented first by the\r\naddition of the unique object known as Saturn, though its brightness is\r\nfar surpassed by that of Sirius, as well as by a few other stars. Then\r\nwe add Mars, an object which occasionally approaches so close to the\r\nearth that it shines with a fiery radiance which would hardly prepare\r\nus for the truth that this planet is intrinsically one of the smallest\r\nof the celestial bodies. Besides the objects we have mentioned, the\r\nancient astronomers had detected a fifth, known as Mercury--a planet\r\nwhich is usually invisible amid the light surrounding the sun. Mercury,\r\nhowever, occasionally wanders far enough from our luminary to be seen\r\nbefore sunrise or after sunset. These five--Mercury, Venus, Mars,\r\nJupiter, and Saturn--comprised the planets known from remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nWe can, however, now extend the list somewhat further by adding to it\r\nthe telescopic objects which have in modern times been found to be among\r\nour neighbours. Here we must no longer postpone the introduction of the\r\ncriterion by which we can detect whether a body is near the earth or\r\nnot. The brighter planets can be recognised by the steady radiance of\r\ntheir light as contrasted with the incessant twinkling of the stars. A\r\nlittle attention devoted to any of the bodies we have named will,\r\nhowever, point out a more definite contrast between the planets and the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nObserve, for instance, Jupiter, on any clear night when the heavens can\r\nbe well seen, and note his position with regard to the constellations in\r\nhis neighbourhood--how he is to the right of this star, or to the left\r\nof that; directly between this pair, or directly pointed to by that. We\r\nthen mark down the place of Jupiter on a celestial map, or we make a\r\nsketch of the stars in the neighbourhood showing the position of the\r\nplanet. After a month or two, when the observations are repeated, the\r\nplace of Jupiter is to be compared again with those stars by which it\r\nwas defined. It will be found that, while the stars have preserved their\r\nrelative positions, the place of Jupiter has changed. Hence this body is\r\nwith propriety called a _planet_, or a wanderer, because it is\r\nincessantly moving from one part of the starry heavens to another. By\r\nsimilar comparisons it can be shown that the other bodies we have\r\nmentioned--Venus and Mercury, Saturn and Mars--are also wanderers, and\r\nbelong to that group of heavenly bodies known as planets. Here, then, we\r\nhave the simple criterion by which the earth's neighbours are readily to\r\nbe discriminated from the stars. Each of the bodies near the earth is a\r\nplanet, or a wanderer, and the mere fact that a body is a wanderer is\r\nalone sufficient to prove it to be one of the class which we are now\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\nProvided with this test, we can at once make an addition to our list of\r\nneighbours. Amid the myriad orbs which the telescope reveals, we\r\noccasionally find one which is a wanderer. Two other mighty planets,\r\nknown as Uranus and Neptune, must thus be added to the five already\r\nmentioned, making in all a group of seven great planets. A vastly\r\ngreater number may also be reckoned when we admit to our view bodies\r\nwhich not only seem to be minute telescopic objects, but really are\r\nsmall globes when compared with the mighty bulk of our earth. These\r\nlesser planets, to the number of more than four hundred, are also among\r\nthe earth's neighbours.\r\n\r\nWe should remark that another class of heavenly bodies widely differing\r\nfrom the planets must also be included in our system. These are the\r\ncomets, and, indeed, it may happen that one of these erratic bodies will\r\nsometimes draw nearer to the earth than even the closest approach ever\r\nmade by a planet. These mysterious visitors will necessarily engage a\r\ngood deal of our attention later on. For the present we confine our\r\nattention to those more substantial globes, whether large or small,\r\nwhich are always termed planets.\r\n\r\nImagine for a moment that some opaque covering could be clasped around\r\nour sun so that all his beams were extinguished. That our earth would be\r\nplunged into the darkness of midnight is of course an obvious\r\nconsequence. A moment's consideration will show that the moon, shining\r\nas it does by the reflected rays of the sun, would become totally\r\ninvisible. But would this extinction of the sunlight have any other\r\neffect? Would it influence the countless brilliant points that stud the\r\nheavens at midnight? Such an obscuration of the sun would indeed produce\r\na remarkable effect on the sky at night, which a little attention would\r\ndisclose. The stars, no doubt, would not exhibit the slightest change in\r\nbrilliancy. Each star shines by its own light and is not indebted to the\r\nsun. The constellations would thus twinkle on as before, but a\r\nwonderful change would come over the planets. Were the sun to be\r\nobscured, the planets would also disappear from view. The midnight sky\r\nwould thus experience the effacement of the planets one by one, while\r\nthe stars would remain unaltered. It may seem difficult to realise how\r\nthe brilliancy of Venus or the lustre of Jupiter have their origin\r\nsolely in the beams which fall upon these bodies from the distant sun.\r\nThe evidence is, however, conclusive on the question; and it will be\r\nplaced before the reader more fully when we come to discuss the several\r\nplanets in detail.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we are looking at Jupiter high in mid-heavens on a winter's\r\nnight, it might be contended that, as the earth lies between Jupiter and\r\nthe sun, it must be impossible for the rays of the sun to fall upon the\r\nplanet. This is, perhaps, not an unnatural view for an inhabitant of\r\nthis earth to adopt until he has become acquainted with the relative\r\nsizes of the various bodies concerned, and with the distances by which\r\nthose bodies are separated. But the question would appear in a widely\r\ndifferent form to an inhabitant of the planet Jupiter. If such a being\r\nwere asked whether he suffered much inconvenience by the intrusion of\r\nthe earth between himself and the sun, his answer would be something of\r\nthis kind:--\"No doubt such an event as the passage of the earth between\r\nme and the sun is possible, and has occurred on rare occasions separated\r\nby long intervals; but so far from the transit being the cause of any\r\ninconvenience, the whole earth, of which you think so much, is really so\r\nminute, that when it did come in front of the sun it was merely seen as\r\na small telescopic point, and the amount of sunlight which it\r\nintercepted was quite inappreciable.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the planets shine by the sun's light points at once to the\r\nsimilarity between them and our earth. We are thus led to regard our sun\r\nas a central fervid globe associated with a number of much smaller\r\nbodies, each of which, being dark itself, is indebted to the sun both\r\nfor light and for heat.\r\n\r\nThat was, indeed, a grand step in astronomy which demonstrated the\r\nnature of the solar system. The discovery that our earth must be a\r\nglobe isolated in space was in itself a mighty exertion of human\r\nintellect; but when it came to be recognised that this globe was but one\r\nof a whole group of similar objects, some smaller, no doubt, but others\r\nvery much larger, and when it was further ascertained that these bodies\r\nwere subordinated to the supreme control of the sun, we have a chain of\r\ndiscoveries that wrought a fundamental transformation in human\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the sun presides over a numerous family. The members of\r\nthat family are dependent upon the sun, and their dimensions are\r\nsuitably proportioned to their subordinate position. Even Jupiter, the\r\nlargest member of that family, does not contain one-thousandth part of\r\nthe material which forms the vast bulk of the sun. Yet the bulk of\r\nJupiter alone would exceed that of the rest of the planets were they all\r\nrolled together.\r\n\r\nAround the central luminary in Fig. 31 we have drawn four circles in\r\ndotted lines which sufficiently illustrate the orbits in which the\r\ndifferent bodies move. The innermost of these four paths represents the\r\norbit of the planet Mercury. The planet moves around the sun in this\r\npath, and regains the place from which it started in eighty-eight days.\r\n\r\nThe next orbit, proceeding outwards from the sun, is that of the planet\r\nVenus, which we have already referred to as the well-known Evening Star.\r\nVenus completes the circuit of its path in 225 days. One step further\r\nfrom the sun and we come to the orbit of another planet. This body is\r\nalmost the same size as Venus, and is therefore much larger than\r\nMercury. The planet now under consideration accomplishes each revolution\r\nin 365 days. This period sounds familiar to our ears. It is the length\r\nof the year; and the planet is the earth on which we stand. There is an\r\nimpressive way in which to realise the length of the road along which\r\nthe earth has to travel in each annual journey. The circumference of a\r\ncircle is about three and one-seventh times the diameter of the same\r\nfigure; so that taking the distance from the earth to the centre of the\r\nsun as 92,900,000 miles, the diameter of the circle which the earth\r\ndescribes around the sun will be 185,800,000 miles, and consequently\r\nthe circumference of the mighty circle in which the earth moves round\r\nthe sun is fully 583,000,000 miles. The earth has to travel this\r\ndistance every year. It is merely a sum in division to find how far we\r\nhave to move each second in order to accomplish this long journey in a\r\ntwelvemonth. It will appear that the earth must actually complete\r\neighteen miles every second, as otherwise it would not finish its\r\njourney within the allotted time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--The Orbits of the Four Interior Planets.]\r\n\r\nPause for a moment to think what a velocity of eighteen miles a second\r\nreally implies. Can we realise a speed so tremendous? Let us compare it\r\nwith our ordinary types of rapid movement. Look at that express train\r\nhow it crashes under the bridge, how, in another moment, it is lost to\r\nview! Can any velocity be greater than that? Let us try it by figures.\r\nThe train moves a mile a minute; multiply that velocity by eighteen and\r\nit becomes eighteen miles a _minute_, but we must further multiply it\r\nby sixty to make it eighteen miles a _second_. The velocity of the\r\nexpress train is not even the thousandth part of the velocity of the\r\nearth. Let us take another illustration. We stand at the rifle ranges to\r\nsee a rifle fired at a target 1,000 feet away, and we find that a second\r\nor two is sufficient to carry the bullet over that distance. The earth\r\nmoves nearly one hundred times as fast as the rifle bullet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--The Earth's Movement.]\r\n\r\nViewed in another way, the stupendous speed of the earth does not seem\r\nimmoderate. The earth is a mighty globe, so great indeed that even when\r\nmoving at this speed it takes almost eight minutes to pass over its own\r\ndiameter. If a steamer required eight minutes to traverse a distance\r\nequal to its own length, its pace would be less than a mile an hour. To\r\nillustrate this method of considering the subject, we show here a view\r\nof the progress made by the earth (Fig. 32). The distance between the\r\ncentres of these circles is about six times the diameter; and,\r\naccordingly, if they be taken to represent the earth, the time required\r\nto pass from one position to the other is about forty-eight minutes.\r\n\r\nOutside the path of the earth, we come to the orbit of the fourth\r\nplanet, Mars, which requires 687 days, or nearly two years, to complete\r\nits circuit round the sun. With our arrival at Mars we have gained the\r\nlimit to the inner portion of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe four planets we have mentioned form a group in themselves,\r\ndistinguished by their comparative nearness to the sun. They are all\r\nbodies of moderate dimensions. Venus and the Earth are globes of about\r\nthe same size. Mercury and Mars are both smaller objects which lie, so\r\nfar as bulk is concerned, between the earth and the moon. The four\r\nplanets which come nearest to the sun are vastly surpassed in bulk and\r\nweight by the giant bodies of our system--the stately group of Jupiter\r\nand Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--The Orbits of the Four Giant Planets.]\r\n\r\nThese giant planets enjoy the sun's guidance equally with their weaker\r\nbrethren. In the diagram on this page (Fig. 33) parts of the orbits of\r\nthe great outer planets are represented. The sun, as before, presides at\r\nthe centre, but the inner planets would on this scale be so close to the\r\nsun that it is only possible to represent the orbit of Mars. After the\r\norbit of Mars comes a considerable interval, not, however, devoid of\r\nplanetary activity, and then follow the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn;\r\nfurther still, we have Uranus, a great globe on the verge of unassisted\r\nvision; and, lastly, the whole system is bounded by the grand orbit of\r\nNeptune--a planet of which we shall have a marvellous story to narrate.\r\n\r\nThe various circles in Fig. 34 show the apparent sizes of the sun as\r\nseen from the different planets. Taking the circle corresponding to the\r\nearth to represent the amount of heat and light which the earth derives\r\nfrom the sun then the other circles indicate the heat and the light\r\nenjoyed by the corresponding planets. The next outer planet to the earth\r\nis Mars, whose share of solar blessings is not so very inferior to that\r\nof the earth; but we fail to see how bodies so remote as Jupiter or\r\nSaturn can enjoy climates at all comparable with those of the planets\r\nwhich are more favourably situated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Comparative Apparent Size of the Sun as seen\r\nfrom the Various Planets.]\r\n\r\nFig. 35 shows a picture of the whole family of planets surrounding the\r\nsun--represented on the same scale, so as to exhibit their comparative\r\nsizes. Measured by bulk, Jupiter is more than 1,200 times as great as\r\nthe earth, so that it would take at least 1,200 earths rolled into one\r\nto form a globe equal to the globe of Jupiter. Measured by weight, the\r\ndisparity between the earth and Jupiter, though still enormous, is not\r\nquite so great; but this is a matter to be discussed more fully in a\r\nlater chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Comparative Sizes of the Planets.]\r\n\r\nEven in this preliminary survey of the solar system we must not omit to\r\nrefer to the planets which attract our attention, not by their bulk, but\r\nby their multitude. In the ample zone bounded on the inside by the orbit\r\nof Mars and on the outside by the orbit of Jupiter it was thought at one\r\ntime that no planet revolved. Modern research has shown that this region\r\nis tenanted, not by one planet, but by hundreds. The discovery of these\r\nplanets is a charge which has been undertaken by various diligent\r\nastronomers of the present day, while the discussion of their movements\r\naffords labour to other men of science. We shall find something to learn\r\nfrom the study of these tiny bodies, and especially from another small\r\nplanet called Eros, which lies nearer to the earth than the limit above\r\nindicated. A chapter will be devoted to these objects.\r\n\r\nBut we do not propose to enter deeply into the mere statistics of the\r\nplanetary system at present. Were such our intention, the tables at the\r\nend of the volume would show that ample materials are available.\r\nAstronomers have taken an inventory of each of the planets. They have\r\nmeasured their distances, the shapes of their orbits and the positions\r\nof those orbits, their times of revolution, and, in the case of all the\r\nlarger planets, their sizes and their weights. Such results are of\r\ninterest for many purposes. It is, however, the more general features of\r\nthe science which at present claim our attention.\r\n\r\nLet us, in conclusion, note one or two important truths with reference\r\nto our planetary system. We have seen that all the planets revolve in\r\nnearly circular paths around the sun. We have now to add another fact\r\npossessing much significance. Each of the planets pursues its path in\r\nthe same direction. It thus happens that one such body may overtake\r\nanother, but it can never happen that two planets pass by each other as\r\ndo the trains on adjacent lines of railway. We shall subsequently find\r\nthat the whole welfare of our system, nay, its continuous existence, is\r\ndependent upon this remarkable uniformity taken in conjunction with\r\nother features of the system.\r\n\r\nSuch is our solar system; a mighty organised group of planets\r\ncirculating under the control of the sun, and completely isolated from\r\nall external interference. No star, no constellation, has any\r\nappreciable influence on our solar system. We constitute a little island\r\ngroup, separated from the nearest stars by the most amazing distances.\r\nIt may be that as the other stars are suns, so they too may have systems\r\nof planets circulating around them; but of this we know nothing. Of the\r\nstars we can only say that they appear to us as points of light, and any\r\nplanets they may possess must for ever remain invisible to us, even if\r\nthey were many times larger than Jupiter.\r\n\r\nWe need not repine at this limitation to our possible knowledge, for\r\njust as we find in the solar system all that is necessary for our daily\r\nbodily wants, so shall we find ample occupation for whatever faculties\r\nwe may possess in endeavouring to understand those mysteries of the\r\nheavens which lie within our reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF GRAVITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Gravitation--The Falling of a Stone to the Ground--All Bodies fall\r\n     equally, Sixteen Feet in a Second--Is this true at Great\r\n     Heights?--Fall of a Body at a Height of a Quarter of a Million\r\n     Miles--How Newton obtained an Answer from the Moon--His Great\r\n     Discovery--Statement of the Law of Gravitation--Illustrations of\r\n     the Law--How is it that all the Bodies in the Universe do not rush\r\n     Together?--The Effect of Motion--How a Circular Path can be\r\n     produced by Attraction--General Account of the Moon's Motion--Is\r\n     Gravitation a Force of Great Intensity?--Two Weights of 50\r\n     lbs.--Two Iron Globes, 53 Yards in Diameter, and a Mile apart,\r\n     attract with a Force of 1 lb.--Characteristics of\r\n     Gravitation--Orbits of the Planets not strictly Circles--The\r\n     Discoveries of Kepler--Construction of an Ellipse--Kepler's First\r\n     Law--Does a Planet move Uniformly?--Law of the Changes of\r\n     Velocity--Kepler's Second Law--The Relation between the Distances\r\n     and the Periodic Times--Kepler's Third Law--Kepler's Laws and the\r\n     Law of Gravitation--Movement in a Straight Line--A Body unacted on\r\n     by Disturbing Forces would move in a Straight Line with Constant\r\n     Velocity--Application to the Earth and the Planets--The Law of\r\n     Gravitation deduced from Kepler's Laws--Universal Gravitation.\r\n\r\nOur description of the heavenly bodies must undergo a slight\r\ninterruption, while we illustrate with appropriate detail an important\r\nprinciple, known as the law of gravitation, which underlies the whole of\r\nastronomy. By this law we can explain the movements of the moon around\r\nthe earth, and of the planets around the sun. It is accordingly\r\nincumbent upon us to discuss this subject before we proceed to the more\r\nparticular account of the separate planets. We shall find, too, that the\r\nlaw of gravitation sheds some much-needed light on the nature of the\r\nstars situated at the remotest distances in space. It also enables us to\r\ncast a glance through the vistas of time past, and to trace with\r\nplausibility, if not with certainty, certain early phases in the history\r\nof our system. The sun and the moon, the planets and the comets, the\r\nstars and the nebulæ, all alike are subject to this universal law, which\r\nis now to engage our attention.\r\n\r\nWhat is more familiar than the fact that when a stone is dropped it\r\nwill fall to the ground? No one at first thinks the matter even worthy\r\nof remark. People are often surprised at seeing a piece of iron drawn to\r\na magnet. Yet the fall of a stone to the ground is the manifestation of\r\na force quite as interesting as the force of magnetism. It is the earth\r\nwhich draws the stone, just as the magnet draws the iron. In each case\r\nthe force is one of attraction; but while the magnetic attraction is\r\nconfined to a few substances, and is of comparatively limited\r\nimportance, the attraction of gravitation is significant throughout the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nLet us commence with a few very simple experiments upon the force of\r\ngravitation. Hold in the hand a small piece of lead, and then allow it\r\nto drop upon a cushion. The lead requires a certain time to move from\r\nthe fingers to the cushion, but that time is always the same when the\r\nheight is the same. Take now a larger piece of lead, and hold one piece\r\nin each hand at the same height. If both are released at the same\r\nmoment, they will both reach the cushion simultaneously. It might have\r\nbeen thought that the heavy body would fall more quickly than the light\r\nbody; but when the experiment is tried, it is seen that this is not the\r\ncase. Repeat the experiment with various other substances. An ordinary\r\nmarble will be found to fall in the same time as the piece of lead. With\r\na piece of cork we again try the experiment, and again obtain the same\r\nresult. At first it seems to fail when we compare a feather with the\r\npiece of lead; but that is solely on account of the air, which resists\r\nthe feather more than it resists the lead. If, however, the feather be\r\nplaced upon the top of a penny, and the penny be horizontal when\r\ndropped, it will clear the air out of the way of the feather in its\r\ndescent, and then the feather will fall as quickly as the penny, as\r\nquickly as the marble, or as quickly as the lead.\r\n\r\nIf the observer were in a gallery when trying these experiments, and if\r\nthe cushion were sixteen feet below his hands, then the time the marble\r\nwould take to fall through the sixteen feet would be one second. The\r\ntime occupied by the cork or by the lead would be the same; and even the\r\nfeather itself would fall through sixteen feet in one second, if it\r\ncould be screened from the interference of the air. Try this experiment\r\nwhere we like, in London, or in any other city, in any island or\r\ncontinent, on board a ship at sea, at the North Pole, or the South Pole,\r\nor the equator, it will always be found that any body, of any size or\r\nany material, will fall about sixteen feet in one second of time.\r\n\r\nLest any erroneous impression should arise, we may just mention that the\r\ndistance traversed in one second does vary slightly at different parts\r\nof the earth, but from causes which need not at this moment detain us.\r\nWe shall for the present regard sixteen feet as the distance through\r\nwhich any body, free from interference, would fall in one second at any\r\npart of the earth's surface. But now let us extend our view above the\r\nearth's surface, and enquire how far this law of sixteen feet in a\r\nsecond may find obedience elsewhere. Let us, for instance, ascend to the\r\ntop of a mountain and try the experiment there. It would be found that\r\nat the top of the mountain a marble would take a little longer to fall\r\nthrough sixteen feet than the same marble would if let fall at its base.\r\nThe difference would be very small; but yet it would be measurable, and\r\nwould suffice to show that the power of the earth to pull the marble to\r\nthe ground becomes somewhat weakened at a point high above the earth's\r\nsurface. Whatever be the elevation to which we ascend, be it either the\r\ntop of a high mountain, or the still greater altitudes that have been\r\nreached in balloon ascents, we shall never find that the tendency of\r\nbodies to fall to the ground ceases, though no doubt the higher we go\r\nthe more is that tendency weakened. It would be of great interest to\r\nfind how far this power of the earth to draw bodies towards it can\r\nreally extend. We cannot attain more than about five or six miles above\r\nthe earth's surface in a balloon; yet we want to know what would happen\r\nif we could ascend 500 miles, or 5,000 miles, or still further, into the\r\nregions of space.\r\n\r\nConceive that a traveller were endowed with some means of soaring aloft\r\nfor miles and thousands of miles, still up and up, until at length he\r\nhad attained the awful height of nearly a quarter of a million of miles\r\nabove the ground. Glancing down at the surface of that earth, which is\r\nat such a stupendous depth beneath, he would be able to see a wonderful\r\nbird's-eye view. He would lose, no doubt, the details of towns and\r\nvillages; the features in such a landscape would be whole continents and\r\nwhole oceans, in so far as the openings between the clouds would permit\r\nthe earth's surface to be exposed.\r\n\r\nAt this stupendous elevation he could try one of the most interesting\r\nexperiments that was ever in the power of a philosopher. He could test\r\nwhether the earth's attraction was felt at such a height, and he could\r\nmeasure the amount of that attraction. Take for the experiment a cork, a\r\nmarble, or any other object, large or small; hold it between the\r\nfingers, and let it go. Everyone knows what would happen in such a case\r\ndown here; but it required Sir Isaac Newton to tell what would happen in\r\nsuch a case up there. Newton asserts that the power of the earth to\r\nattract bodies extends even to this great height, and that the marble\r\nwould fall. This is the doctrine that we can now test. We are ready for\r\nthe experiment. The marble is released, and, lo! our first exclamation\r\nis one of wonder. Instead of dropping instantly, the little object\r\nappears to remain suspended. We are on the point of exclaiming that we\r\nmust have gone beyond the earth's attraction, and that Newton is wrong,\r\nwhen our attention is arrested; the marble is beginning to move, so\r\nslowly that at first we have to watch it carefully. But the pace\r\ngradually improves, so that the attraction is beyond all doubt, until,\r\ngradually acquiring more and more velocity, the marble speeds on its\r\nlong journey of a quarter of a million of miles to the earth.\r\n\r\nBut surely, it will be said, such an experiment must be entirely\r\nimpossible; and no doubt it cannot be performed in the way described.\r\nThe bold idea occurred to Newton of making use of the moon itself, which\r\nis almost a quarter of a million of miles above the earth, for the\r\npurpose of answering the question. Never was our satellite put to such\r\nnoble use before. It is actually at each moment falling in towards the\r\nearth. We can calculate how much it is deflected towards the earth in\r\neach second, and thus obtain a measure of the earth's attractive power.\r\nFrom such enquiries Newton was able to learn that a body released at the\r\ndistance of 240,000 miles above the surface of the earth would still be\r\nattracted by the earth, that in virtue of the attraction the body would\r\ncommence to move off towards the earth--not, indeed, with the velocity\r\nwith which a body falls in experiments on the surface, but with a very\r\nmuch lesser speed. A body dropped down from the distance of the moon\r\nwould commence its long journey so slowly that a _minute_, instead of a\r\n_second_, would have elapsed before the distance of sixteen feet had\r\nbeen accomplished.[11]\r\n\r\nIt was by pondering on information thus won from the moon that Newton\r\nmade his immortal discovery. The gravitation of the earth is a force\r\nwhich extends far and wide through space. The more distant the body, the\r\nweaker the gravitation becomes; here Newton found the means of\r\ndetermining the great problem as to the law according to which the\r\nintensity of the gravitation decreased. The information derived from the\r\nmoon, that a body 240,000 miles away requires a minute to fall through a\r\nspace equal to that through which it would fall in a second down here,\r\nwas of paramount importance. In the first place, it shows that the\r\nattractive power of the earth, by which it draws all bodies earthwards,\r\nbecomes weaker at a distance. This might, indeed, have been anticipated.\r\nIt is as reasonable to suppose that as we retreated further and further\r\ninto the depths of space the power of attraction should diminish, as\r\nthat the lustre of light should diminish as we recede from it; and it is\r\nremarkable that the law according to which the attraction of gravitation\r\ndecreases with the increase of distance is precisely the same as the\r\nlaw according to which the brilliancy of a light decreases as its\r\ndistance increases.\r\n\r\nThe law of nature, stated in its simplest form, asserts that the\r\nintensity of gravitation varies inversely as the square of the distance.\r\nLet me endeavour to elucidate this somewhat abstract statement by one or\r\ntwo simple illustrations. Suppose a body were raised above the surface\r\nof the earth to a height of nearly 4,000 miles, so as to be at an\r\naltitude equal to the radius of the earth. In other words, a body so\r\nsituated would be twice as far from the centre of the earth as a body\r\nwhich lay on the surface. The law of gravitation says that the intensity\r\nof the attraction is then to be decreased to one-fourth part, so that\r\nthe pull of the earth on a body 4,000 miles high is only one quarter of\r\nthe pull of the earth on that body so long as it lies on the ground. We\r\nmay imagine the effect of this pull to be shown in different ways. Allow\r\nthe body to fall, and in the interval of one second it will only drop\r\nthrough four feet, a mere quarter of the distance that gravity would\r\ncause near the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nWe may consider the matter in another way by supposing that the\r\nattraction of the earth is measured by one of those little weighing\r\nmachines known as a spring balance. If a weight of four pounds be hung\r\non such a contrivance, at the earth's surface, the index of course shows\r\na weight of four pounds; but conceive this balance, still bearing the\r\nweight appended thereto, were to be carried up and up, the _indicated_\r\nstrain would become less and less, until by the time the balance reached\r\n4,000 miles high, where it was _twice_ as far away from the earth's\r\ncentre as at first, the indicated strain would be reduced to the\r\n_fourth_ part, and the balance would only show one pound. If we could\r\nimagine the instrument to be carried still further into the depths of\r\nspace, the indication of the scale would steadily continue to decline.\r\nBy the time the apparatus had reached a distance of 8,000 miles high,\r\nbeing then _three_ times as far from the earth's centre as at first, the\r\nlaw of gravitation tells us that the attraction must have decreased to\r\none-ninth part. The strain thus shown on the balance would be only the\r\nninth part of four pounds, or less than half a pound. But let the voyage\r\nbe once again resumed, and let not a halt be made this time until the\r\nbalance and its four-pound weight have retreated to that orbit which the\r\nmoon traverses in its monthly course around the earth. The distance thus\r\nattained is about sixty times the radius of the earth, and consequently\r\nthe attraction of gravitation is diminished in the proportion of one to\r\nthe square of sixty; the spring will then only be strained by the\r\ninappreciable fraction of 1-3,600 part of four pounds. It therefore\r\nappears that a weight which on the earth weighed a ton and a half would,\r\nif raised 240,000 miles, weigh less than a pound. But even at this vast\r\ndistance we are not to halt; imagine that we retreat still further and\r\nfurther; the strain shown by the balance will ever decrease, but it will\r\nstill exist, no matter how far we go. Astronomy appears to teach us that\r\nthe attraction of gravitation can extend, with suitably enfeebled\r\nintensity, across the most profound gulfs of space.\r\n\r\nThe principle of gravitation is of far wider scope than we have yet\r\nindicated. We have spoken merely of the attraction of the earth, and we\r\nhave stated that this force extends throughout space. But the law of\r\ngravitation is not so limited. Not only does the earth attract every\r\nother body, and every other body attract the earth, but each of these\r\nbodies attracts the other; so that in its more complete shape the law of\r\ngravitation announces that \"every body in the universe attracts every\r\nother body with a force which varies inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for us to over-estimate the importance of this law. It\r\nsupplies the clue by which we can unravel the complicated movements of\r\nthe planets. It has led to marvellous discoveries, in which the law of\r\ngravitation has enabled us to anticipate the telescope, and to feel the\r\nexistence of bodies before those bodies have even been seen.\r\n\r\nAn objection which may be raised at this point must first be dealt with.\r\nIt seems to be, indeed, a plausible one. If the earth attracts the moon,\r\nwhy does not the moon tumble down on the earth? If the earth is\r\nattracted by the sun, why does it not tumble into the sun? If the sun is\r\nattracted by other stars, why do they not rush together with a frightful\r\ncollision? It may not unreasonably be urged that if all these bodies in\r\nthe heavens are attracting each other, it would seem that they must all\r\nrush together in consequence of that attraction, and thus weld the whole\r\nmaterial universe into a single mighty mass. We know, as a matter of\r\nfact, that these collisions do not often happen, and that there is\r\nextremely little likelihood of their taking place. We see that although\r\nour earth is said to have been attracted by the sun for countless ages,\r\nyet the earth is just as far from the sun as ever it was. Is not this in\r\nconflict with the doctrine of universal gravitation? In the early days\r\nof astronomy such objections would be regarded, and doubtless were\r\nregarded, as well-nigh insuperable; even still we occasionally hear them\r\nraised, and it is therefore the more incumbent on us to explain how it\r\nhappens that the solar system has been able to escape from the\r\ncatastrophe by which it seems to be threatened.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that if the moon and the earth had been initially\r\nplaced _at rest_, they would have been drawn together by their mutual\r\nattraction. So, too, if the system of planets surrounding the sun had\r\nbeen left initially _at rest_ they would have dashed into the sun, and\r\nthe system would have been annihilated. It is the fact that the planets\r\nare _moving_, and that the moon is _moving_, which has enabled these\r\nbodies successfully to resist the attraction in so far, at least, as\r\nthat they are not drawn thereby to total destruction.\r\n\r\nIt is so desirable that the student should understand clearly how a\r\ncentral attraction is compatible with revolution in a nearly circular\r\npath, that we give an illustration to show how the moon pursues its\r\nmonthly orbit under the guidance and the control of the attracting\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Illustration of the Moon's Motion.]\r\n\r\nThe imaginary sketch in Fig. 36 denotes a section of the earth with a\r\nhigh mountain thereon.[12] If a cannon were stationed on the top of the\r\nmountain at C, and if the cannonball were fired off in the direction C E\r\nwith a moderate charge of powder, the ball would move down along the\r\nfirst curved path. If it be fired a second time with a heavier charge,\r\nthe path will be along the second curved line, and the ball would again\r\nfall to the ground. But let us try next time with a charge still further\r\nincreased, and, indeed, with a far stronger cannon than any piece of\r\nordnance ever yet made. The velocity of the projectile must now be\r\nassumed to be some miles per second, but we can conceive that the speed\r\nshall be so adjusted that the ball shall move along the path C D, always\r\nat the same height above the earth, though still curving, as every\r\nprojectile must curve, from the horizontal line in which it moved at the\r\nfirst moment. Arrived at D, the ball will still be at the same height\r\nabove the surface, and its velocity must be unabated. It will therefore\r\ncontinue in its path and move round another quadrant of the circle\r\nwithout getting nearer to the surface. In this manner the projectile\r\nwill travel completely round the whole globe, coming back again to C and\r\nthen taking another start in the same path. If we could abolish the\r\nmountain and the cannon at the top, we should have a body revolving for\r\never around the earth in consequence of the attraction of gravitation.\r\n\r\nMake now a bold stretch of the imagination. Conceive a terrific cannon\r\ncapable of receiving a round bullet not less than 2,000 miles in\r\ndiameter. Discharge this enormous bullet with a velocity of about 3,000\r\nfeet per second, which is two or three times as great as the velocity\r\nactually attainable in modern artillery. Let this notable bullet be\r\nfired horizontally from some station nearly a quarter of a million miles\r\nabove the surface of the earth. That fearful missile would sweep right\r\nround the earth in a nearly circular orbit, and return to where it\r\nstarted in about four weeks. It would then commence another revolution,\r\nfour weeks more would find it again at the starting point, and this\r\nmotion would go on for ages.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose that we are entirely romancing. We cannot indeed show the\r\ncannon, but we can point to a great projectile. We see it every month;\r\nit is the beautiful moon herself. No one asserts that the moon was ever\r\nshot from such a cannon; but it must be admitted that she moves as if\r\nshe had been. In a later chapter we shall enquire into the history of\r\nthe moon, and show how she came to revolve in this wonderful manner.\r\n\r\nAs with the moon around the earth, so with the earth around the sun. The\r\nillustration shows that a circular or nearly circular motion harmonises\r\nwith the conception of the law of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to regard gravitation as a force of stupendous\r\nmagnitude. Does not gravitation control the moon in its revolution\r\naround the earth? Is not even the mighty earth itself retained in its\r\npath around the sun by the surpassing power of the sun's attraction? No\r\ndoubt the actual force which keeps the earth in its path, as well as\r\nthat which retains the moon in our neighbourhood, is of vast intensity,\r\nbut that is because gravitation is in such cases associated with bodies\r\nof enormous mass. No one can deny that all bodies accessible to our\r\nobservation appear to attract each other in accordance with the law of\r\ngravitation; but it must be confessed that, unless one or both of the\r\nattracting bodies is of gigantic dimensions, the intensity is almost\r\nimmeasurably small.\r\n\r\nLet us attempt to illustrate how feeble is the gravitation between\r\nmasses of easily manageable dimensions. Take, for instance, two iron\r\nweights, each weighing about 50lb., and separated by a distance of one\r\nfoot from centre to centre. There is a certain attraction of gravitation\r\nbetween these weights. The two weights are drawn together, yet they do\r\nnot move. The attraction between them, though it certainly exists, is an\r\nextremely minute force, not at all comparable as to intensity with\r\nmagnetic attraction. Everyone knows that a magnet will draw a piece of\r\niron with considerable vigour, but the intensity of gravitation is very\r\nmuch less on masses of equal amount. The attraction between these two\r\n50lb. weights is less than the ten-millionth part of a single pound.\r\nSuch a force is utterly infinitesimal in comparison with the friction\r\nbetween the weights and the table on which they stand, and hence there\r\nis no response to the attraction by even the slightest movement. Yet, if\r\nwe can conceive each of these weights mounted on wheels absolutely\r\ndevoid of friction, and running on absolutely perfect horizontal rails,\r\nthen there is no doubt that the bodies would slowly commence to draw\r\ntogether, and in the course of time would arrive in actual contact.\r\n\r\nIf we desire to conceive gravitation as a force of measurable intensity,\r\nwe must employ masses immensely more ponderous than those 50lb. weights.\r\nImagine a pair of globes, each composed of 417,000 tons of cast iron,\r\nand each, if solid, being about 53 yards in diameter. Imagine these\r\nglobes placed at a distance of one mile apart. Each globe attracts the\r\nother by the force of gravitation. It does not matter that buildings and\r\nobstacles of every description intervene; gravitation will pass through\r\nsuch impediments as easily as light passes through glass. No screen can\r\nbe devised dense enough to intercept the passage of this force. Each of\r\nthese iron globes will therefore under all circumstances attract the\r\nother; but, notwithstanding their ample proportions, the intensity of\r\nthat attraction is still very small, though appreciable. The attraction\r\nbetween these two globes is a force no greater than the pressure exerted\r\nby a single pound weight. A child could hold back one of these massive\r\nglobes from its attraction by the other. Suppose that all was clear, and\r\nthat friction could be so neutralised as to permit the globes to follow\r\nthe impulse of their mutual attractions. The two globes will then\r\ncommence to approach, but the masses are so large, while the attraction\r\nis so small, that the speed will be accelerated very slowly. A\r\nmicroscope would be necessary to show when the motion has actually\r\ncommenced. An hour and a half must elapse before the distance is\r\ndiminished by a single foot; and although the pace improves\r\nsubsequently, yet three or four days must elapse before the two globes\r\nwill come together.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable characteristic of the force of gravitation must be\r\nhere specially alluded to. The intensity appears to depend only on the\r\nquantity of matter in the bodies, and not at all on the nature of the\r\nsubstances of which these bodies are composed. We have described the two\r\nglobes as made of cast iron, but if either or both were composed of lead\r\nor copper, of wood or stone, of air or water, the attractive power would\r\nstill be the same, provided only that the masses remain unaltered. In\r\nthis we observe a profound difference between the attraction of\r\ngravitation and magnetic attraction. In the latter case the attraction\r\nis not perceptible at all in the great majority of substances, and is\r\nonly considerable in the case of iron.\r\n\r\nIn our account of the solar system we have represented the moon as\r\nrevolving around the earth in a _nearly_ circular path, and the planets\r\nas revolving around the sun in orbits which are also approximately\r\ncircular. It is now our duty to give a more minute description of these\r\nremarkable paths; and, instead of dismissing them as being _nearly_\r\ncircles, we must ascertain precisely in what respects they differ\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nIf a planet revolved around the sun in a truly circular path, of which\r\nthe sun was always at the centre, it is then obvious that the distance\r\nfrom the sun to the planet, being always equal to the radius of the\r\ncircle, must be of constant magnitude. Now, there can be no doubt that\r\nthe distance from the sun to each planet is approximately constant; but\r\nwhen accurate observations are made, it becomes clear that the distance\r\nis not absolutely so. The variations in distance may amount to many\r\nmillions of miles, but, even in extreme cases, the variation in the\r\ndistance of the planet is only a small fraction--usually a very small\r\nfraction--of the total amount of that distance. The circumstances vary\r\nin the case of each of the planets. The orbit of the earth itself is\r\nsuch that the distance from the earth to the sun departs but little from\r\nits mean value. Venus makes even a closer approach to perfectly circular\r\nmovement; while, on the other hand, the path of Mars, and much more the\r\npath of Mercury, show considerable relative fluctuations in the distance\r\nfrom the planet to the sun.\r\n\r\nIt has often been noticed that many of the great discoveries in science\r\nhave their origin in the nice observation and explanation of minute\r\ndepartures from some law approximately true. We have in this department\r\nof astronomy an excellent illustration of this principle. The orbits of\r\nthe planets are nearly circles, but they are not exactly circles. Now,\r\nwhy is this? There must be some natural reason. That reason has been\r\nascertained, and it has led to several of the grandest discoveries that\r\nthe mind of man has ever achieved in the realms of Nature.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let us see the inferences to be drawn from the fact\r\nthat the distance of a planet from the sun is not constant. The motion\r\nin a circle is one of such beauty and simplicity that we are reluctant\r\nto abandon it, unless the necessity for doing so be made clearly\r\napparent. Can we not devise any way by which the circular motion might\r\nbe preserved, and yet be compatible with the fluctuations in the\r\ndistance from the planet to the sun? This is clearly impossible with the\r\nsun at the centre of the circle. But suppose the sun did not occupy the\r\ncentre, while the planet, as before, revolved around the sun. The\r\ndistance between the two bodies would then necessarily fluctuate. The\r\nmore eccentric the position of the sun, the larger would be the\r\nproportionate variation in the distance of the planet when at the\r\ndifferent parts of its orbit. It might further be supposed that by\r\nplacing a series of circles around the sun the various planetary orbits\r\ncould be accounted for. The centre of the circle belonging to Venus is\r\nto coincide very nearly with the centre of the sun, and the centres of\r\nthe orbits of all the other planets are to be placed at such suitable\r\ndistances from the sun as will render a satisfactory explanation of the\r\ngradual increase and decrease of the distance between the two bodies.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the movements of the moon and of the planets\r\nwould be, to a large extent, explained by such a system of circular\r\norbits; but the spirit of astronomical enquiry is not satisfied with\r\napproximate results. Again and again the planets are observed, and again\r\nand again the observations are compared with the places which the\r\nplanets would occupy if they moved in accordance with the system here\r\nindicated. The centres of the circles are moved hither and thither,\r\ntheir radii are adjusted with greater care; but it is all of no avail.\r\nThe observations of the planets are minutely examined to see if they can\r\nbe in error; but of errors there are none at all sufficient to account\r\nfor the discrepancies. The conclusion is thus inevitable--astronomers\r\nare forced to abandon the circular motion, which was thought to possess\r\nsuch unrivalled symmetry and beauty, and are compelled to admit that the\r\norbits of the planets are not circular.\r\n\r\nThen if these orbits be not circles, what are they? Such was the great\r\nproblem which Kepler proposed to solve, and which, to his immortal\r\nglory, he succeeded in solving and in proving to demonstration. The\r\ngreat discovery of the true shape of the planetary orbits stands out as\r\none of the most conspicuous events in the history of astronomy. It may,\r\nin fact, be doubted whether any other discovery in the whole range of\r\nscience has led to results of such far-reaching interest.\r\n\r\nWe must here adventure for a while into the field of science known as\r\ngeometry, and study therein the nature of that curve which the\r\ndiscovery of Kepler has raised to such unparalleled importance. The\r\nsubject, no doubt, is a difficult one, and to pursue it with any detail\r\nwould involve us in many abstruse calculations which would be out of\r\nplace in this volume; but a general sketch of the subject is\r\nindispensable, and we must attempt to render it such justice as may be\r\ncompatible with our limits.\r\n\r\nThe curve which represents with perfect fidelity the movements of a\r\nplanet in its revolution around the sun belongs to that well-known group\r\nof curves which mathematicians describe as the conic sections. The\r\nparticular form of conic section which denotes the orbit of a planet is\r\nknown by the name of the _ellipse_: it is spoken of somewhat less\r\naccurately as an oval. The ellipse is a curve which can be readily\r\nconstructed. There is no simpler method of doing so than that which is\r\nfamiliar to draughtsmen, and which we shall here briefly describe.\r\n\r\nWe represent on the next page (Fig. 37) two pins passing through a sheet\r\nof paper. A loop of twine passes over the two pins in the manner here\r\nindicated, and is stretched by the point of a pencil. With a little care\r\nthe pencil can be guided so as to keep the string stretched, and its\r\npoint will then describe a curve completely round the pins, returning to\r\nthe point from which it started. We thus produce that celebrated\r\ngeometrical figure which is called an ellipse.\r\n\r\nIt will be instructive to draw a number of ellipses, varying in each\r\ncase the circumstances under which they are formed. If, for instance,\r\nthe pins remain placed as before, while the length of the loop is\r\nincreased, so that the pencil is farther away from the pins, then it\r\nwill be observed that the ellipse has lost some of its elongation, and\r\napproaches more closely to a circle. On the other hand, if the length of\r\nthe cord in the loop be lessened, while the pins remain as before, the\r\nellipse will be found more oval, or, as a mathematician would say, its\r\n_eccentricity_ is increased. It is also useful to study the changes\r\nwhich the form of the ellipse undergoes when one of the pins is altered,\r\nwhile the length of the loop remains unchanged. If the two pins be\r\nbrought nearer together the eccentricity will decrease, and the ellipse\r\nwill approximate more closely to the shape of a circle. If the pins be\r\nseparated more widely the eccentricity of the ellipse will be increased.\r\nThat the circle is an extreme form of ellipse will be evident, if we\r\nsuppose the two pins to draw in so close together that they become\r\ncoincident; the point will then simply trace out a circle as the pencil\r\nmoves round the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Drawing an Ellipse.]\r\n\r\nThe points marked by the pins obviously possess very remarkable\r\nrelations with respect to the curve. Each one is called a _focus_, and\r\nan ellipse can only have one pair of foci. In other words, there is but\r\na single pair of positions possible for the two pins, when an ellipse of\r\nspecified size, shape, and position is to be constructed.\r\n\r\nThe ellipse differs principally from a circle in the circumstance that\r\nit possesses variety of form. We can have large and small ellipses just\r\nas we can have large and small circles, but we can also have ellipses of\r\ngreater or less eccentricity. If the ellipse has not the perfect\r\nsimplicity of the circle it has, at least, the charm of variety which\r\nthe circle has not. The oval curve has also the beauty derived from an\r\noutline of perfect grace and an association with ennobling conceptions.\r\n\r\nThe ancient geometricians had studied the ellipse: they had noticed its\r\nfoci; they were acquainted with its geometrical relations; and thus\r\nKepler was familiar with the ellipse at the time when he undertook his\r\ncelebrated researches on the movements of the planets. He had found, as\r\nwe have already indicated, that the movements of the planets could not\r\nbe reconciled with circular orbits. What shape of orbit should next be\r\ntried? The ellipse was ready to hand, its properties were known, and the\r\ncomparison could be made; memorable, indeed, was the consequence of this\r\ncomparison. Kepler found that the movement of the planets could be\r\nexplained, by supposing that the path in which each one revolved was an\r\nellipse. This in itself was a discovery of the most commanding\r\nimportance. On the one hand it reduced to order the movements of the\r\ngreat globes which circulate round the sun; while on the other, it took\r\nthat beautiful class of curves which had exercised the geometrical\r\ntalents of the ancients, and assigned to them the dignity of defining\r\nthe highways of the universe.\r\n\r\nBut we have as yet only partly enunciated the first discovery of Kepler.\r\nWe have seen that a planet revolves in an ellipse around the sun, and\r\nthat the sun is, therefore, at some point in the interior of the\r\nellipse--but at what point? Interesting, indeed, is the answer to this\r\nquestion. We have pointed out how the foci possess a geometrical\r\nsignificance which no other points enjoy. Kepler showed that the sun\r\nmust be situated in one of the foci of the ellipse in which each planet\r\nrevolves. We thus enunciate the first law of planetary motion in the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n     _Each planet revolves around the sun in an elliptic path, having\r\n     the sun at one of the foci._\r\n\r\nWe are now enabled to form a clear picture of the orbits of the planets,\r\nbe they ever so numerous, as they revolve around the sun. In the first\r\nplace, we observe that the ellipse is a plane curve; that is to say,\r\neach planet must, in the course of its long journey, confine its\r\nmovements to one plane. Each planet has thus a certain plane\r\nappropriated to it. It is true that all these planes are very nearly\r\ncoincident, at least in so far as the great planets are concerned; but\r\nstill they are distinct, and the only feature in which they all agree is\r\nthat each one of them passes through the sun. All the elliptic orbits of\r\nthe planets have one focus in common, and that focus lies at the centre\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is well to illustrate this remarkable law by considering the\r\ncircumstances of two or three different planets. Take first the case of\r\nthe earth, the path of which, though really an ellipse, is very nearly\r\ncircular. In fact, if it were drawn accurately to scale on a sheet of\r\npaper, the difference between the elliptic orbit and the circle would\r\nhardly be detected without careful measurement. In the case of Venus the\r\nellipse is still more nearly a circle, and the two foci of the ellipse\r\nare very nearly coincident with the centre of the circle. On the other\r\nhand, in the case of Mercury, we have an ellipse which departs from the\r\ncircle to a very marked extent, while in the orbits of some of the minor\r\nplanets the eccentricity is still greater. It is extremely remarkable\r\nthat every planet, no matter how far from the sun, should be found to\r\nmove in an ellipse of some shape or other. We shall presently show that\r\nnecessity compels each planet to pursue an elliptic path, and that no\r\nother form of path is possible.\r\n\r\nStarted on its elliptic path, the planet pursues its stately course, and\r\nafter a certain duration, known as the _periodic time_, regains the\r\nposition from which its departure was taken. Again the planet traces out\r\nanew the same elliptic path, and thus, revolution after revolution, an\r\nidentical track is traversed around the sun. Let us now attempt to\r\nfollow the body in its course, and observe the history of its motion\r\nduring the time requisite for the completion of one of its circuits. The\r\ndimensions of a planetary orbit are so stupendous that the planet must\r\nrun its course very rapidly in order to finish the journey within the\r\nallotted time. The earth, as we have already seen, has to move eighteen\r\nmiles a second to accomplish one of its voyages round the sun in the\r\nlapse of 365-1/4 days. The question then arises as to whether the rate\r\nat which a planet moves is uniform or not. Does the earth, for instance,\r\nactually move at all times with the velocity of eighteen miles a\r\nsecond, or does our planet sometimes move more rapidly and sometimes\r\nmore slowly, so that the average of eighteen miles a second is still\r\nmaintained? This is a question of very great importance, and we are able\r\nto answer it in the clearest and most emphatic manner. The velocity of a\r\nplanet is _not_ uniform, and the variations of that velocity can be\r\nexplained by the adjoining figure (Fig. 38).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Varying Velocity of Elliptic Motion.]\r\n\r\nLet us first of all imagine the planet to be situated at that part of\r\nits path most distant from the sun towards the right of the figure. In\r\nthis position the body's velocity is at its lowest; as the planet begins\r\nto approach the sun the speed gradually improves until it attains its\r\nmean value. After this point has been passed, and the planet is now\r\nrapidly hurrying on towards the sun, the velocity with which it moves\r\nbecomes gradually greater and greater, until at length, as it dashes\r\nround the sun, its speed attains a maximum. After passing the sun, the\r\ndistance of the planet from the luminary increases, and the velocity of\r\nthe motion begins to abate; gradually it declines until the mean value\r\nis again reached, and then it falls still lower, until the body recedes\r\nto its greatest distance from the sun, by which time the velocity has\r\nabated to the value from which we supposed it to commence. We thus\r\nobserve that the nearer the planet is to the sun the quicker it moves.\r\nWe can, however, give numerical definiteness to the principle according\r\nto which the velocity of the planet varies. The adjoining figure (Fig.\r\n39) shows a planetary orbit, with, of course, the sun at the focus S. We\r\nhave taken two portions, A B and C D, round the ellipse, and joined\r\ntheir extremities to the focus. Kepler's second law may be stated in\r\nthese words:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Every planet moves round the sun with such a velocity at every\r\n     point, that a straight line drawn from it to the sun passes over\r\n     equal areas in equal times._\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Equal Areas in Equal Times.]\r\n\r\nFor example, if the two shaded portions, A B S and D C S, are equal in\r\narea, then the times occupied by the planet in travelling over the\r\nportions of the ellipse, A B and C D, are equal. If the one area be\r\ngreater than the other, then the times required are in the proportion of\r\nthe areas.\r\n\r\nThis law being admitted, the reason of the increase in the planet's\r\nvelocity when it approaches the sun is at once apparent. To accomplish a\r\ndefinite area when near the sun, a larger arc is obviously necessary\r\nthan at other parts of the path. At the opposite extremity, a small arc\r\nsuffices for a large area, and the velocity is accordingly less.\r\n\r\nThese two laws completely prescribe the motion of a planet round the\r\nsun. The first defines the path which the planet pursues; the second\r\ndescribes how the velocity of the body varies at different points along\r\nits path. But Kepler added to these a third law, which enables us to\r\ncompare the movements of two different planets revolving round the same\r\nsun. Before stating this law, it is necessary to explain exactly what is\r\nmeant by the _mean_ distance of a planet. In its elliptic path the\r\ndistance from the sun to the planet is constantly changing; but it is\r\nnevertheless easy to attach a distinct meaning to that distance which is\r\nan average of all the distances. This average is called the mean\r\ndistance. The simplest way of finding the mean distance is to add the\r\ngreatest of these quantities to the least, and take half the sum. We\r\nhave already defined the periodic time of the planet; it is the number\r\nof days which the planet requires for the completion of a journey round\r\nits path. Kepler's third law establishes a relation between the mean\r\ndistances and the periodic times of the various planets. That relation\r\nis stated in the following words:--\r\n\r\n     \"_The squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes\r\n     of the mean distances._\"\r\n\r\nKepler knew that the different planets had different periodic times; he\r\nalso saw that the greater the mean distance of the planet the greater\r\nwas its periodic time, and he was determined to find out the connection\r\nbetween the two. It was easily found that it would not be true to say\r\nthat the periodic time is merely proportional to the mean distance. Were\r\nthis the case, then if one planet had a distance twice as great as\r\nanother, the periodic time of the former would have been double that of\r\nthe latter; observation showed, however, that the periodic time of the\r\nmore distant planet exceeded twice, and was indeed nearly three times,\r\nthat of the other. By repeated trials, which would have exhausted the\r\npatience of one less confident in his own sagacity, and less assured of\r\nthe accuracy of the observations which he sought to interpret, Kepler at\r\nlength discovered the true law, and expressed it in the form we have\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the nature of this law, we shall take for comparison the\r\nearth and the planet Venus. If we denote the mean distance of the earth\r\nfrom the sun by unity then the mean distance of Venus from the sun is\r\n0·7233. Omitting decimals beyond the first place, we can represent the\r\nperiodic time of the earth as 365·3 days, and the periodic time of\r\nVenus as 224·7 days. Now the law which Kepler asserts is that the square\r\nof 365·3 is to the square of 224·7 in the same proportion as unity is to\r\nthe cube of 0·7233. The reader can easily verify the truth of this\r\nidentity by actual multiplication. It is, however, to be remembered\r\nthat, as only four figures have been retained in the expressions of the\r\nperiodic times, so only four figures are to be considered significant in\r\nmaking the calculations.\r\n\r\nThe most striking manner of making the verification will be to regard\r\nthe time of the revolution of Venus as an unknown quantity, and deduce\r\nit from the known revolution of the earth and the mean distance of\r\nVenus. In this way, by assuming Kepler's law, we deduce the cube of the\r\nperiodic time by a simple proportion, and the resulting value of 224·7\r\ndays can then be obtained. As a matter of fact, in the calculations of\r\nastronomy, the distances of the planets are usually ascertained from\r\nKepler's law. The periodic time of the planet is an element which can be\r\nmeasured with great accuracy; and once it is known, then the square of\r\nthe mean distance, and consequently the mean distance itself, is\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nSuch are the three celebrated laws of Planetary Motion, which have\r\nalways been associated with the name of their discoverer. The profound\r\nskill by which these laws were elicited from the mass of observations,\r\nthe intrinsic beauty of the laws themselves, their widespread\r\ngenerality, and the bond of union which they have established between\r\nthe various members of the solar system, have given them quite an\r\nexceptional position in astronomy.\r\n\r\nAs established by Kepler, these planetary laws were merely the results\r\nof observation. It was found, as a matter of fact, that the planets did\r\nmove in ellipses, but Kepler assigned no reason why they should adopt\r\nthis curve rather than any other. Still less was he able to offer a\r\nreason why these bodies should sweep over equal areas in equal times, or\r\nwhy that third law was invariably obeyed. The laws as they came from\r\nKepler's hands stood out as three independent truths; thoroughly\r\nestablished, no doubt, but unsupported by any arguments as to why these\r\nmovements rather than any others should be appropriate for the\r\nrevolutions of the planets.\r\n\r\nIt was the crowning triumph of the great law of universal gravitation to\r\nremove this empirical character from Kepler's laws. Newton's grand\r\ndiscovery bound together the three isolated laws of Kepler into one\r\nbeautiful doctrine. He showed not only that those laws are true, but he\r\nshowed why they must be true, and why no other laws could have been\r\ntrue. He proved to demonstration in his immortal work, the \"Principia,\"\r\nthat the explanation of the famous planetary laws was to be sought in\r\nthe attraction of gravitation. Newton set forth that a power of\r\nattraction resided in the sun, and as a necessary consequence of that\r\nattraction every planet must revolve in an elliptic orbit round the sun,\r\nhaving the sun as one focus; the radius of the planet's orbit must sweep\r\nover equal areas in equal times; and in comparing the movements of two\r\nplanets, it was necessary to have the squares of the periodic times\r\nproportional to the cubes of the mean distances.\r\n\r\nAs this is not a mathematical treatise, it will be impossible for us to\r\ndiscuss the proofs which Newton has given, and which have commanded the\r\nimmediate and universal acquiescence of all who have taken the trouble\r\nto understand them. We must here confine ourselves only to a very brief\r\nand general survey of the subject, which will indicate the character of\r\nthe reasoning employed, without introducing details of a technical\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nLet us, in the first place, endeavour to think of a globe freely poised\r\nin space, and completely isolated from the influence of every other body\r\nin the universe. Let us imagine that this globe is set in motion by some\r\nimpulse which starts it forward on a rapid voyage through the realms of\r\nspace. When the impulse ceases the globe is in motion, and continues to\r\nmove onwards. But what will be the path which it pursues? We are so\r\naccustomed to see a stone thrown into the air moving in a curved path,\r\nthat we might naturally think a body projected into free space will\r\nalso move in a curve. A little consideration will, however, show that\r\nthe cases are very different. In the realms of free space we find no\r\nconception of upwards or downwards; all paths are alike; there is no\r\nreason why the body should swerve to the right or to the left; and hence\r\nwe are led to surmise that in these circumstances a body, once started\r\nand freed from all interference, would move in a straight line. It is\r\ntrue that this statement is one which can never be submitted to the test\r\nof direct experiment. Circumstanced as we are on the surface of the\r\nearth, we have no means of isolating a body from external forces. The\r\nresistance of the air, as well as friction in various other forms, no\r\nless than the gravitation towards the earth itself, interfere with our\r\nexperiments. A stone thrown along a sheet of ice will be exposed to but\r\nlittle resistance, and in this case we see that the stone will take a\r\nstraight course along the frozen surface. A stone similarly cast into\r\nempty space would pursue a course absolutely rectilinear. This we\r\ndemonstrate, not by any attempts at an experiment which would\r\nnecessarily be futile, but by indirect reasoning. The truth of this\r\nprinciple can never for a moment be doubted by one who has duly weighed\r\nthe arguments which have been produced in its behalf.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, then, the rectilinear path of the body, the next question\r\nwhich arises relates to the velocity with which that movement is\r\nperformed. The stone gliding over the smooth ice on a frozen lake will,\r\nas everyone has observed, travel a long distance before it comes to\r\nrest. There is but little friction between the ice and the stone, but\r\nstill even on ice friction is not altogether absent; and as that\r\nfriction always tends to stop the motion, the stone will at length be\r\nbrought to rest. In a voyage through the solitudes of space, a body\r\nexperiences no friction; there is no tendency for the velocity to be\r\nreduced, and consequently we believe that the body could journey on for\r\never with unabated speed. No doubt such a statement seems at variance\r\nwith our ordinary experience. A sailing ship makes no progress on the\r\nsea when the wind dies away. A train will gradually lose its velocity\r\nwhen the steam has been turned off. A humming-top will slowly expend its\r\nrotation and come to rest. From such instances it might be plausibly\r\nargued that when the force has ceased to act, the motion that the force\r\ngenerated gradually wanes, and ultimately vanishes. But in all these\r\ncases it will be found, on reflection, that the decline of the motion is\r\nto be attributed to the action of resisting forces. The sailing ship is\r\nretarded by the rubbing of the water on its sides; the train is checked\r\nby the friction of the wheels, and by the fact that it has to force its\r\nway through the air; and the atmospheric resistance is mainly the cause\r\nof the stopping of the humming-top, for if the air be withdrawn, by\r\nmaking the experiment in a vacuum, the top will continue to spin for a\r\ngreatly lengthened period. We are thus led to admit that a body, once\r\nprojected freely in space and acted upon by no external resistance, will\r\ncontinue to move on for ever in a straight line, and will preserve\r\nunabated to the end of time the velocity with which it originally\r\nstarted. This principle is known as the _first law of motion_.\r\n\r\nLet us apply this principle to the important question of the movement of\r\nthe planets. Take, for instance, the case of our earth, and let us\r\ndiscuss the consequences of the first law of motion. We know that the\r\nearth is moving each moment with a velocity of about eighteen miles a\r\nsecond, and the first law of motion assures us that if this globe were\r\nsubmitted to no external force, it would for ever pursue a straight\r\ntrack through the universe, nor would it depart from the precise\r\nvelocity which it possesses at the present moment. But is the earth\r\nmoving in this manner? Obviously not. We have already found that our\r\nglobe is moving round the sun, and the comprehensive laws of Kepler have\r\ngiven to that motion the most perfect distinctness and precision. The\r\nconsequence is irresistible. The earth cannot be free from external\r\nforce. Some potent influence on our globe must be in ceaseless action.\r\nThat influence, whatever it may be, constantly deflects the earth from\r\nthe rectilinear path which it tends to pursue, and constrains it to\r\ntrace out an ellipse instead of a straight line.\r\n\r\nThe great problem to be solved is now easily stated. There must be some\r\nexternal agent constantly influencing the earth. What is that agent,\r\nwhence does it proceed, and to what laws is it submitted? Nor is the\r\nquestion confined to the earth. Mercury and Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and\r\nSaturn, unmistakably show that, as they are not moving in rectilinear\r\npaths, they must be exposed to some force. What is this force which\r\nguides the planets in their paths? Before the time of Newton this\r\nquestion might have been asked in vain. It was the splendid genius of\r\nNewton which supplied the answer, and thus revolutionised the whole of\r\nmodern science.\r\n\r\nThe data from which the question is to be answered must be obtained from\r\nobservation. We have here no problem which can be solved by mere\r\nmathematical meditation. Mathematics is no doubt a useful, indeed, an\r\nindispensable, instrument in the enquiry; but we must not attribute to\r\nmathematics a potency which it does not possess. In a case of this kind,\r\nall that mathematics can do is to interpret the results obtained by\r\nobservation. The data from which Newton proceeded were the observed\r\nphenomena in the movement of the earth and the other planets. Those\r\nfacts had found a succinct expression by the aid of Kepler's laws. It\r\nwas, accordingly, the laws of Kepler which Newton took as the basis of\r\nhis labours, and it was for the interpretation of Kepler's laws that\r\nNewton invoked the aid of that celebrated mathematical reasoning which\r\nhe created.\r\n\r\nThe question is then to be approached in this way: A planet being\r\nsubject to _some_ external influence, we have to determine what that\r\ninfluence is, from our knowledge that the path of each planet is an\r\nellipse, and that each planet sweeps round the sun over equal areas in\r\nequal times. The influence on each planet is what a mathematician would\r\ncall a force, and a force must have a line of direction. The most simple\r\nconception of a force is that of a pull communicated along a rope, and\r\nthe direction of the rope is in this case the direction of the force.\r\nLet us imagine that the force exerted on each planet is imparted by an\r\ninvisible rope. Kepler's laws will inform us with regard to the\r\ndirection of this rope and the intensity of the strain transmitted\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical analysis of Kepler's laws would be beyond the scope of\r\nthis volume. We must, therefore, confine ourselves to the results to\r\nwhich they lead, and omit the details of the reasoning. Newton first\r\ntook the law which asserted that the planet moved over equal areas in\r\nequal times, and he showed by unimpeachable logic that this at once gave\r\nthe direction in which the force acted on the planet. He showed that the\r\nimaginary rope by which the planet is controlled must be invariably\r\ndirected towards the sun. In other words, the force exerted on each\r\nplanet was at all times pointed from the planet towards the sun.\r\n\r\nIt still remained to explain the intensity of the force, and to show how\r\nthe intensity of that force varied when the planet was at different\r\npoints of its path. Kepler's first law enables this question to be\r\nanswered. If the planet's path be elliptic, and if the force be always\r\ndirected towards the sun at one focus of that ellipse, then mathematical\r\nanalysis obliges us to say that the intensity of the force must vary\r\ninversely as the square of the distance from the planet to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the planets, in conformity with Kepler's laws, would\r\nthus be accounted for even in their minutest details, if we admit that\r\nan attractive power draws the planet towards the sun, and that the\r\nintensity of this attraction varies inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance. Can we hesitate to say that such an attraction does exist? We\r\nhave seen how the earth attracts a falling body; we have seen how the\r\nearth's attraction extends to the moon, and explains the revolution of\r\nthe moon around the earth. We have now learned that the movement of the\r\nplanets round the sun can also be explained as a consequence of this law\r\nof attraction. But the evidence in support of the law of universal\r\ngravitation is, in truth, much stronger than any we have yet presented.\r\nWe shall have occasion to dwell on this matter further on. We shall show\r\nnot only how the sun attracts the planets, but how the planets attract\r\neach other; and we shall find how this mutual attraction of the planets\r\nhas led to remarkable discoveries, which have elevated the law of\r\ngravitation beyond the possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the existence of this law, we can show that the planets must\r\nrevolve around the sun in elliptic paths with the sun in the common\r\nfocus. We can show that they must sweep over equal areas in equal times.\r\nWe can prove that the squares of the periodic times must be proportional\r\nto the cubes of their mean distances. Still further, we can show how the\r\nmysterious movements of comets can be accounted for. By the same great\r\nlaw we can explain the revolutions of the satellites. We can account for\r\nthe tides, and for other phenomena throughout the Solar System. Finally,\r\nwe shall show that when we extend our view beyond the limits of our\r\nSolar System to the beautiful starry systems scattered through space, we\r\nfind even there evidence of the great law of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANET OF ROMANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Outline of the Subject--Is Mercury the Planet nearest the\r\n     Sun?--Transit of an Interior Planet across the Sun--Has a Transit\r\n     of Vulcan ever been seen?--Visibility of Planets during a Total\r\n     Eclipse of the Sun--Professor Watson's Researches in 1878.\r\n\r\nProvided with a general survey of the Solar System, and with such an\r\noutline of the law of universal gravitation as the last chapter has\r\nafforded us, we commence the more detailed examination of the planets\r\nand their satellites. We shall begin with the planets nearest to the\r\nsun, and then we shall gradually proceed outwards to one planet after\r\nanother, until we reach the confines of the system. We shall find much\r\nto occupy our attention. Each planet is itself a globe, and it will be\r\nfor us to describe as much as is known of it. The satellites by which so\r\nmany of the planets are accompanied possess many points of interest. The\r\ncircumstances of their discovery, their sizes, their movements, and\r\ntheir distances must be duly considered. It will also be found that the\r\nmovements of the planets present much matter for reflection and\r\nexamination. We shall have occasion to show how the planets mutually\r\ndisturb each other, and what remarkable consequences have arisen from\r\nthese influences. We must also occasionally refer to the important\r\nproblems of celestial measuring and celestial weighing. We must show how\r\nthe sizes, the weights, and the distances of the various members of our\r\nsystem are to be discovered. The greater part of our task will\r\nfortunately lead us over ground which is thoroughly certain, and where\r\nthe results have been confirmed by frequent observation. It happens,\r\nhowever, that at the very outset of our course we are obliged to deal\r\nwith observations which are far from certain. The existence of a planet\r\nmuch closer to the sun than those hitherto known has been asserted by\r\ncompetent authority. The question is still unsettled, but the planet\r\ncannot at present be found. Hence it is that we have called the subject\r\nof this chapter, The Planet of Romance.\r\n\r\nIt had often been thought that Mercury, long supposed to be the nearest\r\nplanet to the sun, was perhaps not really the body entitled to that\r\ndistinction. Mercury revolves round the sun at an average distance of\r\nabout 36,000,000 miles. In the interval between it and the sun there\r\nmight have been one or many other planets. There might have been one\r\nrevolving at ten million miles, another at fifteen, and so on. But did\r\nsuch planets exist? Did even one planet revolve inside the orbit of\r\nMercury? There were certain reasons for believing in such a planet. In\r\nthe movements of Mercury indications were perceptible of an influence\r\nthat it was at one time thought might have been accounted for by the\r\nsupposition of an interior planet.[13] But there was necessarily a great\r\ndifficulty about seeing this object. It must always be close to the sun,\r\nand even in the best telescope it is generally impossible to see a\r\nstar-like point in that position. Nor could such a planet be seen after\r\nsunset, for under the most favourable conditions it would set almost\r\nimmediately after the sun, and a like difficulty would make it invisible\r\nat sunrise.\r\n\r\nOur ordinary means of observing a planet have therefore completely\r\nfailed. We are compelled to resort to extraordinary methods if we would\r\nseek to settle the great question as to the existence of the\r\nintra-Mercurial planets. There are at least two lines of observation\r\nwhich might be expected to answer our purpose.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity for the first would arise when it happened that the\r\nunknown planet came directly between the earth and the sun. In the\r\ndiagram (Fig. 40) we show the sun at the centre; the internal dotted\r\ncircle denotes the orbit of the unknown planet, which has received the\r\nname of Vulcan before even its very existence has been at all\r\nsatisfactorily established. The outer circle denotes the orbit of the\r\nearth. As Vulcan moves more rapidly than the earth, it will frequently\r\nhappen that the planet will overtake the earth, so that the three bodies\r\nwill have the positions represented in the diagram. It would not,\r\nhowever, necessarily follow that Vulcan was exactly between the earth\r\nand the luminary. The path of the planet may be tilted, so that, as seen\r\nfrom the earth, Vulcan would be over or under the sun, according to\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Vulcan really does exist, we might expect that sometimes\r\nthe three bodies will be directly in line, and this would then give the\r\ndesired opportunity of making the telescopic discovery of the planet. We\r\nshould expect on such an occasion to observe the planet as a dark spot,\r\nmoving slowly across the face of the sun. The two other planets interior\r\nto the earth, namely, Mercury and Venus, are occasionally seen in the\r\nact of transit; and there cannot be a doubt that if Vulcan exists, its\r\ntransits across the sun must be more numerous than those of Mercury, and\r\nfar more numerous than those of Venus. On the other hand, it may\r\nreasonably be anticipated that Vulcan is a small globe, and as it will\r\nbe much more distant from us than Mercury at the time of its transit, we\r\ncould not expect that the transit of the planet of romance would be at\r\nall comparable as a spectacle with those of either of the two other\r\nbodies we have named.\r\n\r\nThe question arises as to whether telescopic research has ever disclosed\r\nanything which can be regarded as a transit of Vulcan. On this point it\r\nis not possible to speak with any certainty. It has, on more than one\r\noccasion, been asserted by observers that a spot has been seen\r\ntraversing the sun, and from its shape and general appearance they have\r\npresumed it to have been an intra-Mercurial planet. But a close\r\nexamination of the circumstances in which such observations have been\r\nmade has not tended to increase confidence in this presumption. Such\r\ndiscoveries have usually been made by persons little familiar with\r\ntelescopic observations. It is certainly a significant fact that,\r\nnotwithstanding the diligent scrutiny to which the sun has been\r\nsubjected during the past century by astronomers who have specially\r\ndevoted themselves to this branch of research, no telescopic discovery\r\nof Vulcan on the sun has been announced by any really experienced\r\nastronomer. The last announcement of a planet having crossed the sun\r\ndates from 1876, and was made by a German amateur, but what he thought\r\nto have been a planet was promptly shown to have been a small sun-spot,\r\nwhich had been photographed at Greenwich in the course of the daily\r\nroutine work, and had also been observed at Madrid. From an examination\r\nof the whole subject, we are inclined to believe that there is not at\r\nthis moment any reliable telescopic evidence of the transit of an\r\nintra-Mercurial planet over the face of the central luminary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--The Transit of the Planet of Romance.]\r\n\r\nBut there is still another method by which we might reasonably hope to\r\ndetect new planets in the vicinity of the sun. This method is, however,\r\nbut seldom available. It is only possible when the sun is totally\r\neclipsed.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon is interposed directly between the earth and the sun, the\r\nbrightness of day is temporarily exchanged for the gloom of night. If\r\nthe sky be free from clouds the stars spring forth, and can be seen\r\naround the obscured sun. Even if a planet were quite close to the\r\nluminary it would be visible on such an occasion if its magnitude were\r\ncomparable with that of Mercury. Careful preparation is necessary when\r\nit is proposed to make a trial of this kind. The danger to be specially\r\navoided is that of confounding the planet with the ordinary stars, which\r\nit will probably resemble. The late distinguished American astronomer,\r\nProfessor Watson, specially prepared to devote himself to this research\r\nduring the notable total eclipse in 1878. When the eclipse occurred the\r\nlight of the sun vanished and the stars burst forth. Among them\r\nProfessor Watson saw an object which to him seemed to be the long-sought\r\nintra-Mercurial planet. We should add that this zealous observer saw\r\nanother object which he at first took to be the star known as Zeta in\r\nthe constellation Cancer. When he afterwards found that the recorded\r\nplace of this object did not agree so well as he expected with the known\r\nposition of this star, he came to the conclusion that it could not be\r\nZeta but must be some other unknown planet. The relative positions of\r\nthe two objects which he took to be planets agree, however, sufficiently\r\nwell, considering the difficulties of the observation, with the relative\r\npositions of the stars Theta and Zeta Cancri, and it can now hardly be\r\ndoubted that Watson merely saw these two stars. He maintained, however,\r\nthat he had noticed Theta Cancri as well as the two planets, but without\r\nrecording its position. There is, however, a third star, known as 20\r\nCancri, near the same place, and this Watson probably mistook for Theta.\r\nIt is necessary to record that Vulcan has not been observed, though\r\nspecially looked for, during the eclipses which have occurred since\r\n1878, and it is accordingly the general belief among astronomers that no\r\nplanet has yet been detected within the orbit of Mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMERCURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Ancient Astronomical Discoveries--How Mercury was first\r\n     found--Not easily seen--Mercury was known from the earliest\r\n     ages--Skill necessary in the Discovery--The Distinction of Mercury\r\n     from a Star--Mercury in the East and in the West--The\r\n     Prediction--How to Observe Mercury--Its Telescopic\r\n     Appearance--Difficulty of Observing its Appearance--Orbit of\r\n     Mercury--Velocity of the Planet--Can there be Life on the\r\n     Planet?--Changes in its Temperature--Transit of Mercury over the\r\n     Sun--Gassendi's Observations--Rotation of Mercury--The Weight of\r\n     Mercury.\r\n\r\nLong and glorious is the record of astronomical discovery. The\r\ndiscoveries of modern days have succeeded each other with such rapidity,\r\nthey have so often dazzled our imaginations with their brilliancy, that\r\nwe are sometimes apt to think that astronomical discovery is a purely\r\nmodern product. But no idea could be more fundamentally wrong. While we\r\nappreciate to the utmost the achievements of modern times, let us\r\nendeavour to do justice to the labours of the astronomers of antiquity.\r\n\r\nAnd when we speak of the astronomers of antiquity, let us understand\r\nclearly what is meant. The science is now growing so rapidly that each\r\ncentury witnesses a surprising advance; each generation, each decade,\r\neach year, has its own rewards for those diligent astronomers by whom\r\nthe heavens are so carefully scanned. We must, however, project our\r\nglance to a remote epoch in time past, if we would view the memorable\r\ndiscovery of Mercury. Compared with it, the discoveries of Newton are to\r\nbe regarded as very modern achievements; even the announcement of the\r\nCopernican system of the heavens is itself a recent event in comparison\r\nwith the detection of this planet now to be discussed.\r\n\r\nBy whom was this great discovery made? Let us see if the question can\r\nbe answered by the examination of astronomical records. At the close of\r\nhis memorable life Copernicus was heard to express his sincere regret\r\nthat he never enjoyed an opportunity of beholding the planet Mercury. He\r\nhad specially longed to see this body, the movements of which were to\r\nsuch a marked extent illustrative of the theory of the celestial motions\r\nwhich it was his immortal glory to have established, but he had never\r\nbeen successful. Mercury is not generally to be seen so easily as are\r\nsome of the other planets, and it may well have been that the vapours\r\nfrom the immense lagoon at the mouth of the Vistula obscured the horizon\r\nat Frauenburg, where Copernicus dwelt, and thus his opportunities of\r\nviewing Mercury were probably even rarer than they are at other places.\r\n\r\nThe existence of Mercury was certainly quite a familiar fact in the time\r\nof Copernicus, and therefore we must look to some earlier epoch for its\r\ndiscovery. In the scanty astronomical literature of the Middle Ages we\r\nfind occasional references to the existence of this object. We can trace\r\nobservations of Mercury through remote centuries to the commencement of\r\nour era. Records from dates still earlier are not wanting, until at\r\nlength we come on an observation which has descended to us for more than\r\n2,000 years, having been made in the year 265 before the Christian era.\r\nIt is not pretended, however, that this observation records the\r\n_discovery_ of the planet. Earlier still we find the chief of the\r\nastronomers at Nineveh alluding to Mercury in a report which he made to\r\nAssurbanipal, the King of Assyria. It does not appear in the least\r\ndegree likely that the discovery was even then a recent one. It may have\r\nbeen that the planet was independently discovered in two or more\r\nlocalities, but all records of such discoveries are totally wanting; and\r\nwe are ignorant alike of the names of the discoverers, of the nations to\r\nwhich they belonged, and of the epochs at which they lived.\r\n\r\nAlthough this discovery is of such vast antiquity, although it was made\r\nbefore correct notions were entertained as to the true system of the\r\nuniverse, and, it is needless to add, long before the invention of the\r\ntelescope, yet it must not be assumed that the detection of Mercury was\r\nby any means a simple or obvious matter. This will be manifest when we\r\ntry to conceive the manner in which the discovery must probably have\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nSome primæval astronomer, long familiar with the heavens, had learned to\r\nrecognise the various stars and constellations. Experience had impressed\r\nupon him the permanence of these objects; he had seen that Sirius\r\ninvariably appeared at the same seasons of the year, and he had noticed\r\nhow it was placed with regard to Orion and the other neighbouring\r\nconstellations. In the same manner each of the other bright stars was to\r\nhim a familiar object always to be found in a particular region of the\r\nheavens. He saw how the stars rose and set in such a way, that though\r\neach star appeared to move, yet the relative positions of the stars were\r\nincapable of alteration. No doubt this ancient astronomer was acquainted\r\nwith Venus; he knew the evening star; he knew the morning star; and he\r\nmay have concluded that Venus was a body which oscillated from one side\r\nof the sun to the other.\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine how the discovery of Mercury was made in the clear\r\nskies over an Eastern desert. The sun has set, the brief twilight has\r\nalmost ceased, when lo, near that part of the horizon where the glow of\r\nthe setting sun still illuminates the sky, a bright star is seen. The\r\nprimæval astronomer knows that there is no bright star at this place in\r\nthe heavens. If the object of his attention be not a star, what, then,\r\ncan it be? Eager to examine this question, the heavens are watched next\r\nnight, and there again, higher above the horizon, and more brilliant\r\nstill, is the object seen the night before. Each successive night the\r\nbody gains more and more lustre, until at length it becomes a\r\nconspicuous gem. Perhaps it will rise still higher and higher; perhaps\r\nit will increase till it attains the brilliancy of Venus itself. Such\r\nwere the surmises not improbably made by those who first watched this\r\nobject; but they were not realised. After a few nights of exceptional\r\nsplendour the lustre of this mysterious orb declines. The planet again\r\ndraws near the horizon at sunset, until at length it sets so soon after\r\nthe sun that it has become invisible. Is it lost for ever? Years may\r\nelapse before another opportunity of observing the object after sunset\r\nmay be available; but then again it will be seen to run through the same\r\nseries of changes, though, perhaps, under very different circumstances.\r\nThe greatest height above the horizon and the greatest brightness both\r\nvary considerably.\r\n\r\nLong and careful observations must have been made before the primæval\r\nastronomer could assure himself that the various appearances might all\r\nbe attributed to a single body. In the Eastern deserts the phenomena of\r\nsunrise must have been nearly as familiar as those of sunset, and in the\r\nclear skies, at the point where the sunbeams were commencing to dawn\r\nabove the horizon, a bright star-like point might sometimes be\r\nperceived. Each successive day this object rose higher and higher above\r\nthe horizon before the moment of sunrise, and its lustre increased with\r\nthe distance; then again it would draw in towards the sun, and return\r\nfor many months to invisibility. Such were the data which were presented\r\nto the mind of the primitive astronomer. One body was seen after sunset,\r\nanother body was seen before sunrise. To us it may seem an obvious\r\ninference from the observed facts that the two bodies were identical.\r\nThe inference is a correct one, but it is in no sense an obvious one.\r\nLong and patient observation established the remarkable law that one of\r\nthese bodies was never seen until the other had disappeared. Hence it\r\nwas inferred that the phenomena, both at sunrise and at sunset, were due\r\nto the same body, which oscillated to and fro about the sun.\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine that the announcement of the identity of these two\r\nobjects was one which would have to be carefully tested before it could\r\nbe accepted. How are the tests to be applied in a case of this kind?\r\nThere can hardly be a doubt that the most complete and convincing\r\ndemonstration of scientific truth is found in the fulfilment of\r\nprediction. When Mercury had been observed for years, a certain\r\nregularity in the recurrence of its visibility was noticed. Once a\r\nperiodicity had been fully established, prediction became possible. The\r\ntime when Mercury would be seen after sunset, the time when it would be\r\nseen before sunrise, could be foretold with accuracy! When it was found\r\nthat these predictions were obeyed to the letter--that the planet was\r\nalways seen when looked for in accordance with the predictions--it was\r\nimpossible to refuse assent to the hypothesis on which these predictions\r\nwere based. Underlying that hypothesis was the assumption that all the\r\nvarious appearances arose from the oscillations of a single body, and\r\nhence the discovery of Mercury was established on a basis as firm as the\r\ndiscovery of Jupiter or of Venus.\r\n\r\nIn the latitudes of the British Islands it is generally possible to see\r\nMercury some time during the course of the year. It is not practicable\r\nto lay down, within reasonable limits, any general rule for finding the\r\ndates at which the search should be made; but the student who is\r\ndetermined to see the planet will generally succeed with a little\r\npatience. He must first consult an almanac which gives the positions of\r\nthe body, and select an occasion when Mercury is stated to be an evening\r\nor a morning star. Such an occasion during the spring months is\r\nespecially suitable, as the elevation of Mercury above the horizon is\r\nusually greater then than at other seasons; and in the evening twilight,\r\nabout three-quarters of an hour after sunset, a view of this shy but\r\nbeautiful object will reward the observer's attention.\r\n\r\nTo those astronomers who are provided with equatorial telescopes such\r\ninstructions are unnecessary. To enjoy a telescopic view of Mercury, we\r\nfirst turn to the Nautical Almanac, and find the position in which the\r\nplanet lies. If it happen to be above the horizon, we can at once direct\r\nthe telescope to the place, and even in broad daylight the planet will\r\nvery often be seen. The telescopic appearance of Mercury is, however,\r\ndisappointing. Though it is much larger than the moon, yet it is\r\nsufficiently far off to seem insignificant. There is, however, one\r\nfeature in a view of this planet which would immediately attract\r\nattention. Mercury is not usually observed to be a circular object, but\r\nmore or less crescent-shaped, like a miniature moon. The phases of the\r\nplanet are also to be accounted for on exactly the same principles as\r\nthe phases of the moon. Mercury is a globe composed, like our earth, of\r\nmaterials possessing in themselves no source of illumination. One\r\nhemisphere of the planet must necessarily be turned towards the sun, and\r\nthis side is accordingly lighted up brilliantly by the solar rays. When\r\nwe look at Mercury we see nothing of the non-illuminated side, and the\r\ncrescent is due to the foreshortened view which we obtain of the\r\nilluminated part. The planet is such a small object that, in the glitter\r\nof the naked-eye view, the _shape_ of the luminous body cannot be\r\ndefined. Indeed, even in the much larger crescent of Venus, the aid of\r\nthe telescope has to be invoked before the characteristic form can be\r\nobserved. Beyond, however, the fact that Mercury is a crescent, and that\r\nit undergoes varying phases in correspondence with the changes in its\r\nrelative position to the earth and the sun, we cannot see much of the\r\nplanet. It is too small and too bright to admit of easy delineation of\r\ndetails on its surface. No doubt attempts have been made, and\r\nobservations have been recorded, as to certain very faint and indistinct\r\nmarkings on the planet, but such statements must be received with great\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--The Movement of Mercury, showing the Variations\r\nin Phase and in apparent size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Mercury as a Crescent.]\r\n\r\nThe facts which have been thoroughly established with regard to Mercury\r\nare mainly numerical statements as to the path it describes around the\r\nsun. The time taken by the planet to complete one of its revolutions is\r\neighty-eight days nearly. The average distance from the sun is about\r\n36,000,000 miles, and the mean velocity with which the body moves is\r\nover twenty-nine miles a second. We have already alluded to the most\r\ncharacteristic and remarkable feature of the orbit of Mercury. That\r\norbit differs from the paths of all the other large planets by its much\r\ngreater departure from the circular form. In the majority of cases the\r\nplanetary orbits are so little elliptic that a diagram of the orbit\r\ndrawn accurately to scale would not be perceived to differ from a circle\r\nunless careful measurements were made. In the case of Mercury the\r\ncircumstances are different. The elliptic form of the path would be\r\nquite unmistakable by the most casual observer. The distance from the\r\nsun to the planet fluctuates between very considerable limits. The\r\nlowest value it can attain is about 30,000,000 miles; the highest value\r\nis about 43,000,000 miles. In accordance with Kepler's second law, the\r\nvelocity of the planet must exhibit corresponding changes. It must sweep\r\nrapidly around that part of his path near the sun, and more slowly round\r\nthe remote parts of his path. The greatest velocity is about\r\nthirty-five miles a second, and the least is twenty-three miles a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nFor an adequate conception of the movements of Mercury we ought not to\r\ndissociate the velocity from the true dimensions of the body by which it\r\nis performed. No doubt a speed of twenty-nine miles a second is enormous\r\nwhen compared with the velocities with which daily life makes us\r\nfamiliar. The speed of the planet is not less than a hundred times as\r\ngreat as the velocity of the rifle bullet. But when we compare the sizes\r\nof the bodies with their velocities, the velocity of Mercury seems\r\nrelatively much less than that of the bullet. A rifle bullet traverses a\r\ndistance equal to its own diameter many thousands of times in a second.\r\nBut even though Mercury is moving so much faster, yet the dimensions of\r\nthe planet are so considerable that a period of two minutes will be\r\nrequired for it to move through a distance equal to its diameter.\r\nViewing the globe of the planet as a whole, the velocity of its movement\r\nis but a stately and dignified progress appropriate to its dimensions.\r\n\r\nAs we can learn little or nothing of the true surface of Mercury, it is\r\nutterly impossible for us to say whether life can exist on the surface\r\nof that planet. We may, however, reasonably conclude that there cannot\r\nbe life on Mercury in any respect analogous to the life which we know on\r\nthe earth. The heat of the sun and the light of the sun beat down on\r\nMercury with an intensity many times greater than that which we\r\nexperience. When this planet is at its utmost distance from the sun the\r\nintensity of solar radiation is even then more than four times greater\r\nthan the greatest heat which ever reaches the earth. But when Mercury,\r\nin the course of its remarkable changes of distance, draws in to the\r\nwarmest part of its orbit, it is exposed to a terrific scorching. The\r\nintensity of the sun's heat must then be not less than nine times as\r\ngreat as the greatest radiation to which we are exposed.\r\n\r\nThese tremendous climatic changes succeed each other much more rapidly\r\nthan do the variations of our seasons. On Mercury the interval between\r\nmidsummer and midwinter is only forty-four days, while the whole year\r\nis only eighty-eight days. Such rapid variations in solar heat must in\r\nthemselves exercise a profound effect on the habitability of Mercury.\r\nMr. Ledger well remarks, in his interesting work,[14] that if there be\r\ninhabitants on Mercury the notions of \"perihelion\" and \"aphelion,\" which\r\nare here often regarded as expressing ideas of an intricate or recondite\r\ncharacter, must on the surface of that planet be familiar to everybody.\r\nThe words imply \"near the sun,\" and \"away from the sun;\" but we do not\r\nassociate these expressions with any obvious phenomena, because the\r\nchanges in the distance of the earth from the sun are inconsiderable.\r\nBut on Mercury, where in six weeks the sun rises to more than double his\r\napparent size, and gives more than double the quantity of light and of\r\nheat, such changes as are signified by perihelion and aphelion embody\r\nideas obviously and intimately connected with the whole economy of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless rash to found any inferences as to climate merely\r\nupon the proximity or the remoteness of the sun. Climate depends upon\r\nother matters besides the sun's distance. The atmosphere surrounding the\r\nearth has a profound influence on heat and cold, and if Mercury have an\r\natmosphere--as has often been supposed--its climate may be thereby\r\nmodified to any necessary extent. It seems, however, hardly possible to\r\nsuppose that any atmosphere could form an adequate protection for the\r\ninhabitants from the violent and rapid fluctuations of solar radiation.\r\nAll we can say is, that the problem of life in Mercury belongs to the\r\nclass of unsolved, and perhaps unsolvable, mysteries.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1629 that Kepler made an important announcement as to\r\nimpending astronomical events. He had been studying profoundly the\r\nmovements of the planets; and from his study of the past he had ventured\r\nto predict the future. Kepler announced that in the year 1631 the\r\nplanets Venus and Mercury would both make a transit across the sun, and\r\nhe assigned the dates to be November 7th for Mercury, and December 6th\r\nfor Venus. This was at the time a very remarkable prediction. We are so\r\naccustomed to turn to our almanacs and learn from them all the\r\nastronomical phenomena which are anticipated during the year, that we\r\nare apt to forget how in early times this was impossible. It has only\r\nbeen by slow degrees that astronomy has been rendered so perfect as to\r\nenable us to foretell, with accuracy, the occurrence of the more\r\ndelicate phenomena. The prediction of those transits by Kepler, some\r\nyears before they occurred, was justly regarded at the time as a most\r\nremarkable achievement.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Gassendi prepared to apply the test of actual\r\nobservation to the announcements of Kepler. We can now assign the time\r\nof the transit accurately to within a few minutes, but in those early\r\nattempts equal precision was not practicable. Gassendi considered it\r\nnecessary to commence watching for the transit of Mercury two whole days\r\nbefore the time indicated by Kepler, and he had arranged an ingenious\r\nplan for making his observations. The light of the sun was admitted into\r\na darkened room through a hole in the shutter, and an image of the sun\r\nwas formed on a white screen by a lens. This is, indeed, an admirable\r\nand a very pleasing way of studying the surface of the sun, and even at\r\nthe present day, with our best telescopes, one of the methods of viewing\r\nour luminary is founded on the same principle.\r\n\r\nGassendi commenced his watch on the 5th of November, and carefully\r\nstudied the sun's image at every available opportunity. It was not,\r\nhowever, until five hours after the time assigned by Kepler that the\r\ntransit of Mercury actually commenced. Gassendi's preparations had been\r\nmade with all the resources which he could command, but these resources\r\nseem very imperfect when compared with the appliances of our modern\r\nobservatories. He was anxious to note the time when the planet appeared,\r\nand for this purpose he had stationed an assistant in the room beneath,\r\nwho was to observe the altitude of the sun at the moment indicated by\r\nGassendi. The signal to the assistant was to be conveyed by a very\r\nprimitive apparatus. Gassendi was to stamp on the floor when the\r\ncritical moment had arrived. In spite of the long delay, which\r\nexhausted the patience of the assistant, some valuable observations were\r\nobtained, and thus the first passage of a planet across the sun was\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe transits of Mercury are not rare phenomena (there have been thirteen\r\nof them during the nineteenth century), and they are chiefly of\r\nimportance on account of the accuracy which their observation infuses\r\ninto our calculations of the movements of the planet. It has often been\r\nhoped that the opportunities afforded by a transit would be available\r\nfor procuring information as to the physical character of the globe of\r\nMercury, but these hopes have not been realised.\r\n\r\nSpectroscopic observations of Mercury are but scanty. They seem to\r\nindicate that water vapour is a probable constituent in the atmosphere\r\nof Mercury, as it is in our own.\r\n\r\nA distinguished Italian astronomer, Professor Schiaparelli, some years\r\nago announced a remarkable discovery with respect to the rotation of the\r\nplanet Mercury. He found that the planet rotates on its axis in the same\r\nperiod as it revolves around the sun. The practical consequence of the\r\nidentity between these two periods is that Mercury always turns the same\r\nface to the sun. If our earth were to rotate in a similar fashion, then\r\nthe hemisphere directed to the sun would enjoy eternal day, while the\r\nopposite hemisphere would be relegated to perpetual night. According to\r\nthis discovery, Mercury revolves around the sun in the same way as the\r\nmoon revolves around the earth. As the velocity with which Mercury\r\ntravels round the sun is very variable, owing to the highly elliptic\r\nshape of its orbit, while the rotation about its axis is performed with\r\nuniform speed, it follows that rather more than a hemisphere (about\r\nfive-eighths of the surface) enjoys more or less the light of the sun in\r\nthe course of a Mercurial year.\r\n\r\nThis important discovery of Schiaparelli has lately been confirmed by an\r\nAmerican astronomer, Mr. Lowell, of Arizona, U.S.A., who observed the\r\nplanet under very favourable conditions with a refractor of twenty-four\r\ninches aperture. He has detected on the globe of Mercury certain narrow,\r\ndark lines, the very slow shifting of which points to a period of\r\nrotation about its axis exactly coincident with the period of\r\nrevolution round the sun. The same observer shows that the axis of\r\nrotation of Mercury is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. Mr.\r\nLowell has perceived no sign of clouds or obscurations, and indeed no\r\nindication of any atmospheric envelope; the surface of Mercury is\r\ncolourless, \"a geography in black and white.\"\r\n\r\nWe may assert that, there is a strong _à priori_ probability in favour\r\nof the reality of Schiaparelli's discovery. Mercury, being one of the\r\nplanets devoid of a moon, will be solely influenced by the sun in so far\r\nas tidal phenomena are concerned. Owing, moreover, to the proximity of\r\nMercury to the sun, the solar tides on that planet possess an especial\r\nvehemence. As the tendency of tides is to make Mercury present a\r\nconstant face to the sun, there need be little hesitation in accepting\r\ntestimony that tides have wrought exactly the result that we know they\r\nwere competent to perform.\r\n\r\nHere we take leave of the planet Mercury--an interesting and beautiful\r\nobject, which stimulates our intellectual curiosity, while at the same\r\ntime it eludes our attempts to make a closer acquaintance. There is,\r\nhowever, one point of attainable knowledge which we must mention in\r\nconclusion. It is a difficult, but not by any means an impossible, task\r\nto weigh Mercury in the celestial balance, and determine his mass in\r\ncomparison with the other globes of our system. This is a delicate\r\noperation, but it leads us through some of the most interesting paths of\r\nastronomical discovery. The weight of the planet, as recently determined\r\nby Von Asten, is about one twenty-fourth part of the weight of the\r\nearth, but the result is more uncertain than the determinations of the\r\nmass of any of the other larger planets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nVENUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Interest attaching to this Planet--The Unexpectedness of its\r\n     Appearance--The Evening Star--Visibility in Daylight--Lighted only\r\n     by the Sun--The Phases of Venus--Why the Crescent is not Visible to\r\n     the Unaided Eye--Variations in the Apparent Size of the Planet--The\r\n     Rotation of Venus--Resemblance of Venus to the Earth--The Transit\r\n     of Venus--Why of such Especial Interest--The Scale of the Solar\r\n     System--Orbits of the Earth and Venus not in the same\r\n     Plane--Recurrence of the Transits in Pairs--Appearance of Venus in\r\n     Transit--Transits of 1874 and 1882--The Early Transits of 1631 and\r\n     1639--The Observations of Horrocks and Crabtree--The Announcement\r\n     of Halley--How the Track of the Planet differs from Different\r\n     Places--Illustrations of Parallax--Voyage to Otaheite--The Result\r\n     of Encke--Probable Value of the Sun's Distance--Observations at\r\n     Dunsink of the Last Transit of Venus--The Question of an Atmosphere\r\n     to Venus--Other Determinations of the Sun's Distance--Statistics\r\n     about Venus.\r\n\r\nIt might, for one reason, have been not inappropriate to have commenced\r\nour review of the planetary system by the description of the planet\r\nVenus. This body is not especially remarkable for its size, for there\r\nare other planets hundreds of times larger. The orbit of Venus is no\r\ndoubt larger than that of Mercury, but it is much smaller than that of\r\nthe outer planets. Venus has not even the splendid retinue of minor\r\nattendants which gives such dignity and such interest to the mighty\r\nplanets of our system. Yet the fact still remains that Venus is peerless\r\namong the planetary host. We speak not now of celestial bodies only seen\r\nin the telescope; we refer to the ordinary observation which detected\r\nVenus ages before telescopes were invented.\r\n\r\nWho has not been delighted with the view of this glorious object? It is\r\nnot to be seen at all times. For months together the star of evening is\r\nhidden from mortal gaze. Its beauties are even enhanced by the caprice\r\nand the uncertainty which attend its appearance. We do not say that\r\nthere is any caprice in the movements of Venus, as known to those who\r\ndiligently consult their almanacs. The movements of the lovely planet\r\nare there prescribed with a prosaic detail hardly in harmony with the\r\ncharacter usually ascribed to the Goddess of Love. But to those who do\r\nnot devote particular attention to the stars, the very unexpectedness of\r\nits appearance is one of its greatest charms. Venus has not been\r\nnoticed, not been thought of, for many months. It is a beautifully clear\r\nevening; the sun has just set. The lover of nature turns to admire the\r\nsunset, as every lover of nature will. In the golden glory of the west a\r\nbeauteous gem is seen to glitter; it is the evening star--the planet\r\nVenus. A few weeks later another beautiful sunset is seen, and now the\r\nplanet is no longer a point low down in the western glow; it has risen\r\nhigh above the horizon, and continues a brilliant object long after the\r\nshades of night have descended. Again, a little later, and Venus has\r\ngained its full brilliancy and splendour. All the heavenly host--even\r\nSirius and even Jupiter--must pale before the splendid lustre of Venus,\r\nthe unrivalled queen of the firmament.\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of splendour, the height of Venus at sunset diminishes, and\r\nits lustre begins gradually to decline. It sinks to invisibility, and is\r\nforgotten by the great majority of mankind; but the capricious goddess\r\nhas only moved from one side of the sky to the other. Ere the sun rises,\r\nthe morning star will be seen in the east. Its splendour gradually\r\naugments until it rivals the beauty of the evening star. Then again the\r\nplanet draws near to the sun, and remains lost to view for many months,\r\nuntil the same cycle of changes recommences, after an interval of a year\r\nand seven months.\r\n\r\nWhen Venus is at its brightest it can be easily seen in broad daylight\r\nwith the unaided eye. This striking spectacle proclaims in an\r\nunmistakable manner the unrivalled supremacy of this planet as compared\r\nwith its fellow-planets and with the fixed stars. Indeed, at this time\r\nVenus is from forty to sixty times more brilliant than any stellar\r\nobject in the northern heavens.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful evening star is often such a very conspicuous object that\r\nit may seem difficult at first to realise that the body is not\r\nself-luminous. Yet it is impossible to doubt that the planet is really\r\nonly a dark globe, and to that extent resembles our own earth. The\r\nbrilliance of the planet is not so very much greater than that of the\r\nearth on a sunshiny day. The splendour of Venus entirely arises from the\r\nreflected light of the sun, in the manner already explained with respect\r\nto the moon.\r\n\r\nWe cannot distinguish the characteristic crescent shape of the planet\r\nwith the unaided eye, which merely shows a brilliant point too small to\r\npossess sensible form. This is to be explained on physiological grounds.\r\nThe optical contrivances in the eye form an image of the planet on the\r\nretina which is necessarily very small. Even when Venus is nearest to\r\nthe earth the diameter of the planet subtends an angle not much more\r\nthan one minute of arc. On the delicate membrane a picture of Venus is\r\nthus drawn about one six-thousandth part of an inch in diameter. Great\r\nas may be the delicacy of the retina, it is not adequate to the\r\nperception of form in a picture so minute. The nervous structure, which\r\nhas been described as the source of vision, forms too coarse a canvas\r\nfor the reception of the details of this tiny picture. Hence it is that\r\nto the unaided eye the brilliant Venus appears merely as a bright spot.\r\nOrdinary vision cannot tell what shape it has; still less can it reveal\r\nthe true beauty of the crescent.\r\n\r\nIf the diameter of Venus were several times as great as it actually is;\r\nwere this body, for instance, as large as Jupiter or some of the other\r\ngreat planets, then its crescent could be readily discerned by the\r\nunaided eye. It is curious to speculate on what might have been the\r\nhistory of astronomy had Venus only been as large as Jupiter. Were\r\neveryone able to see the crescent form without a telescope, it would\r\nthen have been an elementary and almost obvious truth that Venus must be\r\na dark body revolving round the sun. The analogy between Venus and our\r\nearth would have been at once perceived; and the doctrine which was left\r\nto be discovered by Copernicus in comparatively modern times might not\r\nimprobably have been handed down to us with the other discoveries which\r\nhave come from the ancient nations of the East.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Venus, May 29th, 1889.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most perfect drawing of Venus that has been hitherto\r\nobtained is that made (Fig. 43) by Professor E.E. Barnard, on 29th May,\r\n1889, with a 12-inch equatorial, at the Lick Observatory, which for this\r\npurpose and on this occasion Professor Barnard found to be superior to\r\nthe 36-inch. The markings shown seem undoubtedly to exist on the planet,\r\nand in 1897 Professor Barnard writes: \"The circumstances under which\r\nthis drawing was made are memorable with me, for I never afterwards had\r\nsuch perfect conditions to observe Venus.\"\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 44 we show three views of Venus under different aspects. The\r\nplanet is so much closer to the earth when the crescent is seen, that it\r\nappears to be part of a much larger circle than that made by Venus when\r\nmore nearly full. This drawing shows the different aspects of the globe\r\nin their true relative proportions. It is very difficult to perceive\r\ndistinctly any markings on the brilliantly lighted surface. Sometimes\r\nobservers have seen spots or other features, and occasionally the\r\npointed extremities of the horns have been irregular, as if to show that\r\nthe surface of Venus is not smooth. Some observers report having seen\r\nwhite spots at the poles of Venus, in some degree resembling the more\r\nconspicuous features of the same character to be seen on Mars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Different Aspects of Venus in the Telescope.]\r\n\r\nAs it is so very difficult to see any markings on Venus, we are hardly\r\nyet able to give a definite answer to the important question as to the\r\nperiod of rotation of this planet round its axis. Various observers\r\nduring the last two hundred years have from very insufficient data\r\nconcluded that Venus rotated in about twenty-three hours. Schiaparelli,\r\nof Milan, turned his attention to this planet in 1877 and noticed a dark\r\nshade and two bright spots, all situated not far from the southern end\r\nof the crescent. This most painstaking astronomer watched these\r\nmarkings for three months, and found that there was no change\r\nperceptible in the position which they occupied. This was particularly\r\nthe case when he continued his watch for some consecutive hours. This\r\nfact seemed to show conclusively that Venus could not rotate in\r\ntwenty-three hours nor in any other short period. Week after week the\r\nspots remained unaltered, until Schiaparelli felt convinced that his\r\nobservations could only be reconciled with a period of rotation between\r\nsix and nine months. He naturally concluded that the period was 225\r\ndays--that is to say, the period which Venus takes to complete one\r\nrevolution round the sun; in other words, Venus always turns the same\r\nface to the sun.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable result was confirmed by observations made at Nice; but\r\nit has been vigorously assailed by several observers, who maintain that\r\ntheir own drawings can only agree with a period about equal to that of\r\nthe rotation of our own earth. Schiaparelli's result is, however, well\r\nsupported by the letters of Mr. Lowell. He has published a number of\r\ndrawings of Venus made with his 24-inch refractor, and he finds that the\r\nrotation is performed in the same time as the planet's orbital\r\nrevolution, the axis of rotation being perpendicular to the plane of the\r\norbit. The markings seen by Mr. Lowell were long and streaky, and they\r\nwere always visible whenever his own atmospheric conditions were fairly\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the moon revolves so as to keep the same face always\r\nturned towards the earth. We have now seen that the planets Venus and\r\nMercury each appear to revolve in such a way that they keep the same\r\nface towards the sun. All these phenomena are of profound interest in\r\nthe higher departments of astronomical research. They are not mere\r\ncoincidences. They arise from the operation of the tides, in a manner\r\nthat will be explained in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nIt happens that our earth and Venus are very nearly equal in bulk. The\r\ndifference is hardly perceptible, but the earth has a diameter a few\r\nmiles greater than that of Venus. There are indications of the existence\r\nof an atmosphere around Venus, and the evidence of the spectroscope\r\nshows that water vapour is there present.\r\n\r\nIf there be oxygen in the atmosphere of Venus, then it would seem\r\npossible that there might be life on that globe not essentially\r\ndifferent in character from some forms of life on the earth. No doubt\r\nthe sun's heat on Venus is greatly in excess of the sun's heat with\r\nwhich we are acquainted, but this is not an insuperable difficulty. We\r\nsee at present on the earth, life in very hot regions and life in very\r\ncold regions. Indeed, with each approach to the Equator we find life\r\nmore and more exuberant; so that, if water be present on the surface of\r\nVenus and if oxygen be a constituent of its atmosphere, we might expect\r\nto find in that planet a luxuriant tropical life, of a kind perhaps\r\nanalogous in some respects to life on the earth.\r\n\r\nIn our account of the planet Mercury, as well as in the brief\r\ndescription of the hypothetical planet Vulcan, it has been necessary to\r\nallude to the phenomena presented by the transit of a planet over the\r\nface of the sun. Such an event is always of interest to astronomers, and\r\nespecially so in the case of Venus. We have in recent years had the\r\nopportunity of witnessing two of these rare occurrences. It is perhaps\r\nnot too much to assert that the transits of 1874 and 1882 have received\r\na degree of attention never before accorded to any astronomical\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe transit of Venus cannot be described as a very striking or beautiful\r\nspectacle. It is not nearly so fine a sight as a great comet or a shower\r\nof shooting stars. Why is it, then, that it is regarded as of so much\r\nscientific importance? It is because the phenomenon helps us to solve\r\none of the greatest problems which has ever engaged the mind of man. By\r\nthe transit of Venus we may determine the scale on which our solar\r\nsystem is constructed. Truly this is a noble problem. Let us dwell upon\r\nit for a moment. In the centre of our system we have the sun--a majestic\r\nglobe more than a million times as large as the earth. Circling round\r\nthe sun we have the planets, of which our earth is but one. There are\r\nhundreds of small planets. There are a few comparable with our earth;\r\nthere are others vastly surpassing the earth. Besides the planets there\r\nare other bodies in our system. Many of the planets are accompanied by\r\nsystems of revolving moons. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of\r\ncomets. Each member of this stupendous host moves in a prescribed orbit\r\naround the sun, and collectively they form the solar system.\r\n\r\nIt is comparatively easy to learn the proportions of this system, to\r\nmeasure the relative distances of the planets from the sun, and even the\r\nrelative sizes of the planets themselves. Peculiar difficulties are,\r\nhowever, experienced when we seek to ascertain the actual _size_ of the\r\nsystem as well as its shape. It is this latter question which the\r\ntransit of Venus offers us a method of solving.\r\n\r\nLook, for instance, at an ordinary map of Europe. We see the various\r\ncountries laid down with precision; we can tell the courses of the\r\nrivers; we can say that France is larger than England, and Russia larger\r\nthan France; but no matter how perfectly the map be constructed,\r\nsomething else is necessary before we can have a complete conception of\r\nthe dimensions of the country. We must know _the scale on which the map\r\nis drawn_. The map contains a reference line with certain marks upon it.\r\nThis line is to give the scale of the map. Its duty is to tell us that\r\nan inch on the map corresponds with so many miles on the actual surface.\r\nUnless it be supplemented by the scale, the map would be quite useless\r\nfor many purposes. Suppose that we consulted it in order to choose a\r\nroute from London to Vienna, we can see at once the direction to be\r\ntaken and the various towns and countries to be traversed; but unless we\r\nrefer to the little scale in the corner, the map will not tell how many\r\nmiles long the journey is to be.\r\n\r\nA map of the solar system can be readily constructed. We can draw on it\r\nthe orbits of some of the planets and of their satellites, and we can\r\ninclude many of the comets. We can assign to the planets and to the\r\norbits their proper proportions. But to render the map quite efficient\r\nsomething more is necessary. We must have the scale which is to tell us\r\nhow many millions of miles on the heavens correspond to one inch of the\r\nmap. It is at this point we encounter a difficulty. There are, however,\r\nseveral ways of solving the problem, though they are all difficult and\r\nlaborious. The most celebrated method (though far from the best) is that\r\npresented on an occasion of the transit of Venus. Herein, then, lies the\r\nimportance of this rare event. It is one of the best-known means of\r\nfinding the actual scale on which our system is constructed. Observe the\r\nfull importance of the problem. Once the scale has been determined, then\r\nall is known. We know the size of the sun; we know his distance; we know\r\nthe bulk of Jupiter, and the distances at which his satellites revolve;\r\nwe know the dimensions of the comets, and the number of miles to which\r\nthey recede in their wanderings; we know the velocity of the shooting\r\nstars; and we learn the important lesson that our earth is but one of\r\nthe minor members of the sun's family.\r\n\r\nAs the path of Venus lies inside that of the earth, and as Venus moves\r\nmore quickly than the earth, it follows that the earth is frequently\r\npassed by the planet, and just at the critical moment it will sometimes\r\nhappen that the earth, the planet, and the sun lie in the same straight\r\nline. We can then see Venus on the face of the sun, and this is the\r\nphenomenon which we call the _transit of Venus_. It is, indeed, quite\r\nplain that if the three bodies were exactly in a line, an observer on\r\nthe earth, looking at the planet, would see it brought out vividly\r\nagainst the brilliant background of the sun.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the earth is overtaken by Venus once every nineteen\r\nmonths, it might seem that the transits of the planet should occur with\r\ncorresponding frequency. This is not the case; the transit of Venus is\r\nan exceedingly rare occurrence, and a hundred years or more will often\r\nelapse without a single one taking place. The rarity of these phenomena\r\narises from the fact that the path of the planet is inclined to the\r\nplane of the earth's orbit; so that for half of its path Venus is above\r\nthe plane of the earth's orbit, and in the other half it is below. When\r\nVenus overtakes the earth, the line from the earth to Venus will\r\ntherefore usually pass over or under the sun. If, however, it should\r\nhappen that Venus overtakes the earth at or near either of the points in\r\nwhich the plane of the orbit of Venus passes through that of the earth,\r\nthen the three bodies will be in line, and a transit of Venus will be\r\nthe consequence. The rarity of the occurrence of a transit need no\r\nlonger be a mystery. The earth passes through one of the critical parts\r\nevery December, and through the other every June. If it happens that the\r\nconjunction of Venus occurs on, or close to, June 6th or December 7th,\r\nthen a transit of Venus will occur at that conjunction, but in no other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable law with reference to the repetition of the\r\nphenomenon is the well-known eight-year interval. The transits may be\r\nall grouped together into pairs, the two transits of any single pair\r\nbeing separated by an interval of eight years. For instance, a transit\r\nof Venus took place in 1761, and again in 1769. No further transits\r\noccurred until those witnessed in 1874 and in 1882. Then, again, comes a\r\nlong interval, for another transit will not occur until 2004, but it\r\nwill be followed by another in 2012.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement of the transits in pairs admits of a very simple\r\nexplanation. It happens that the periodic time of Venus bears a\r\nremarkable relation to the periodic time of the earth. The planet\r\naccomplishes thirteen revolutions around the sun in very nearly the same\r\ntime that the earth requires for eight revolutions. If, therefore, Venus\r\nand the earth were in line with the sun in 1874, then in eight years\r\nmore the earth will again be found in the same place; and so will Venus,\r\nfor it has just been able to accomplish thirteen revolutions. A transit\r\nof Venus having occurred on the first occasion, a transit must also\r\noccur on the second.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to be supposed that every eight years the planets\r\nwill again resume the same position with sufficient precision for a\r\nregular eight-year transit interval. It is only approximately true that\r\nthirteen revolutions of Venus are coincident with eight revolutions of\r\nthe earth. Each recurrence of conjunction takes place at a slightly\r\ndifferent position of the planets, so that when the two planets came\r\ntogether again in the year 1890 the point of conjunction was so far\r\nremoved from the critical point that the line from the earth to Venus\r\ndid not intersect the sun, and thus, although Venus passed very near the\r\nsun, yet no transit took place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Venus on the Sun at the Transit of 1874.]\r\n\r\nFig. 45 represents the transit of Venus in 1874. It is taken from a\r\nphotograph obtained, during the occurrence, by M. Janssen. His telescope\r\nwas directed towards the sun during the eventful minutes while it\r\nlasted, and thus an image of the sun was depicted on the photographic\r\nplate placed in the telescope. The lighter circle represents the disc of\r\nthe sun. On that disc we see the round, sharp image of Venus, showing\r\nthe characteristic appearance of the planet during the progress of the\r\ntransit. The only other features to be noticed are a few of the solar\r\nspots, rather dimly shown, and a network of lines which were marked on a\r\nglass plate across the field of view of the telescope to facilitate\r\nmeasurements.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining sketch (Fig. 46) exhibits the course which the planet\r\npursued in its passage across the sun on the two occasions in 1874 and\r\n1882. Our generation has had the good fortune to witness the two\r\noccurrences indicated on this picture. The white circle denotes the disc\r\nof the sun; the planet encroaches on the white surface, and at first is\r\nlike a bite out of the sun's margin. Gradually the black spot steals in\r\nfront of the sun, until, after nearly half an hour, the black disc is\r\nentirely visible. Slowly the planet wends its way across, followed by\r\nhundreds of telescopes from every accessible part of the globe whence\r\nthe phenomenon is visible, until at length, in the course of a few\r\nhours, it emerges at the other side.\r\n\r\nIt will be useful to take a brief retrospect of the different transits\r\nof Venus of which there is any historical record. They are not numerous.\r\nHundreds of such phenomena have occurred since man first came on the\r\nearth. It was not until the approach of the year 1631 that attention\r\nbegan to be directed to the matter, though the transit which undoubtedly\r\noccurred in that year was not noticed by anyone. The success of Gassendi\r\nin observing the transit of Mercury, to which we have referred in the\r\nlast chapter, led him to hope that he would be equally fortunate in\r\nobserving the transit of Venus, which Kepler had also foretold. Gassendi\r\nlooked at the sun on the 4th, 5th, and 6th December. He looked at it\r\nagain on the 7th, but he saw no sign of the planet. We now know the\r\nreason. The transit of Venus took place during the night, between the\r\n6th and the 7th, and must therefore have been invisible to European\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nKepler had not noticed that another transit would occur in 1639. This\r\ndiscovery was made by another astronomer, and it is the one with which\r\nthe history of the subject may be said to commence. It was the first\r\noccasion on which the phenomenon was ever actually witnessed; nor was it\r\nthen seen by many. So far as is known, it was witnessed by only two\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--The Path of Venus across the Sun in the\r\nTransits of 1874 and 1882.]\r\n\r\nA young and ardent English astronomer, named Horrocks, had undertaken\r\nsome computations about the motions of Venus. He made the discovery that\r\nthe transit of Venus would be repeated in 1639, and he prepared to\r\nverify the fact. The sun rose bright on the morning of the day--which\r\nhappened to be a Sunday. The clerical profession, which Horrocks\r\nfollowed, here came into collision with his desires as an astronomer. He\r\ntells us that at nine he was called away by business of the highest\r\nimportance--referring, no doubt, to his official duties; but the service\r\nwas quickly performed, and a little before ten he was again on the\r\nwatch, only to find the brilliant face of the sun without any unusual\r\nfeature. It was marked with a spot, but nothing that could be mistaken\r\nfor a planet. Again, at noon, came an interruption; he went to church,\r\nbut he was back by one. Nor were these the only impediments to his\r\nobservations. The sun was also more or less clouded over during part of\r\nthe day. However, at a quarter past three in the afternoon his clerical\r\nwork was over; the clouds had dispersed, and he once more resumed his\r\nobservations. To his intense delight he then saw on the sun the round,\r\ndark spot, which was at once identified as the planet Venus. The\r\nobservations could not last long; it was the depth of winter, and the\r\nsun was rapidly setting. Only half an hour was available, but he had\r\nmade such careful preparations beforehand that it sufficed to enable him\r\nto secure some valuable measurements.\r\n\r\nHorrocks had previously acquainted his friend, William Crabtree, with\r\nthe impending occurrence. Crabtree was therefore on the watch, and\r\nsucceeded in seeing the transit; a striking picture of Crabtree's famous\r\nobservation is shown in one of the beautiful frescoes in the Town Hall\r\nat Manchester. But to no one else had Horrocks communicated the\r\nintelligence; as he says, \"I hope to be excused for not informing other\r\nof my friends of the expected phenomenon, but most of them care little\r\nfor trifles of this kind, rather preferring their hawks and hounds, to\r\nsay no worse; and although England is not without votaries of astronomy,\r\nwith some of whom I am acquainted, I was unable to convey to them the\r\nagreeable tidings, having myself had so little notice.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till long afterwards that the full importance of the transit\r\nof Venus was appreciated. Nearly a century had rolled away when the\r\ngreat astronomer, Halley (1656-1742), drew attention to the subject. The\r\nnext transit was to occur in 1761, and forty-five years before that\r\nevent Halley explained his celebrated method of finding the distance of\r\nthe sun by means of the transit of Venus.[15] He was then a man sixty\r\nyears of age; he could have no expectation that he would live to witness\r\nthe event; but in noble language he commends the problem to the notice\r\nof the learned, and thus addresses the Royal Society of London:--\"And\r\nthis is what I am now desirous to lay before this illustrious Society,\r\nwhich I foretell will continue for ages, that I may explain beforehand\r\nto young astronomers, who may, perhaps, live to observe these things, a\r\nmethod by which the immense distance of the sun may be truly\r\nobtained.... I recommend it, therefore, again and again to those curious\r\nastronomers who, when I am dead, will have an opportunity of observing\r\nthese things, that they would remember this my admonition, and\r\ndiligently apply themselves with all their might in making the\r\nobservations, and I earnestly wish them all imaginable success--in the\r\nfirst place, that they may not by the unseasonable obscurity of a cloudy\r\nsky be deprived of this most desirable sight, and then that, having\r\nascertained with more exactness the magnitudes of the planetary orbits,\r\nit may redound to their immortal fame and glory.\" Halley lived to a good\r\nold age, but he died nineteen years before the transit occurred.\r\n\r\nThe student of astronomy who desires to learn how the transit of Venus\r\nwill tell the distance from the sun must prepare to encounter a\r\ngeometrical problem of no little complexity. We cannot give to the\r\nsubject the detail that would be requisite for a full explanation. All\r\nwe can attempt is to render a general account of the method, sufficient\r\nto enable the reader to see that the transit of Venus really does\r\ncontain all the elements necessary for the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nWe must first explain clearly the conception which is known to\r\nastronomers by the name of _parallax_; for it is by parallax that the\r\ndistance of the sun, or, indeed, the distance of any other celestial\r\nbody, must be determined. Let us take a simple illustration. Stand near\r\na window whence you can look at buildings, or the trees, the clouds, or\r\nany distant objects. Place on the glass a thin strip of paper vertically\r\nin the middle of one of the panes. Close the right eye, and note with\r\nthe left eye the position of the strip of paper relatively to the\r\nobjects in the background. Then, while still remaining in the same\r\nposition, close the left eye and again observe the position of the\r\nstrip of paper with the right eye. You will find that the position of\r\nthe paper on the background has changed. As I sit in my study and look\r\nout of the window I see a strip of paper, with my right eye, in front of\r\na certain bough on a tree a couple of hundred yards away; with my left\r\neye the paper is no longer in front of that bough, it has moved to a\r\nposition near the outline of the tree. This apparent displacement of the\r\nstrip of paper, relatively to the distant background, is what is called\r\nparallax.\r\n\r\nMove closer to the window, and repeat the observation, and you find that\r\n_the apparent displacement of the strip increases_. Move away from the\r\nwindow, and the displacement decreases. Move to the other side of the\r\nroom, the displacement is much less, though probably still visible. We\r\nthus see that the change in the apparent place of the strip of paper, as\r\nviewed with the right eye or the left eye, varies in amount as the\r\ndistance changes; but it varies in the opposite way to the distance, for\r\nas either becomes greater the other becomes less. We can thus associate\r\nwith each particular distance a corresponding particular displacement.\r\nFrom this it will be easy to infer that if we have the means of\r\nmeasuring the amount of displacement, then we have the means of\r\ncalculating the distance from the observer to the window.\r\n\r\nIt is this principle, applied on a gigantic scale, which enables us to\r\nmeasure the distances of the heavenly bodies. Look, for instance, at the\r\nplanet Venus; let this correspond to the strip of paper, and let the\r\nsun, on which Venus is seen in the act of transit, be the background.\r\nInstead of the two eyes of the observer, we now place two observatories\r\nin distant regions of the earth; we look at Venus from one observatory,\r\nwe look at it from the other; we measure the amount of the displacement,\r\nand from that we calculate the distance of the planet. All depends,\r\nthen, on the means which we have of measuring the displacement of Venus\r\nas viewed from the two different stations. There are various ways of\r\naccomplishing this, but the most simple is that originally proposed by\r\nHalley.\r\n\r\nFrom the observatory at A Venus seems to pursue the upper of the two\r\ntracks shown in the adjoining figure (Fig. 47). From the observatory at\r\nB it follows the lower track, and it is for us to measure the distance\r\nbetween the two tracks. This can be accomplished in several ways.\r\nSuppose the observer at A notes the time that Venus has occupied in\r\ncrossing the disc, and that similar observations be made at B. As the\r\ntrack seen from B is the larger, it must follow that the time observed\r\nat B will be greater than that at A. When the observations from the\r\ndifferent hemispheres are compared, the _times_ observed will enable the\r\nlengths of the tracks to be calculated. The lengths being known, their\r\nplaces on the circular disc of the sun are determined, and hence the\r\namount of displacement of Venus in transit is ascertained. Thus it is\r\nthat the distance of Venus is measured, and the scale of the solar\r\nsystem is known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--To Illustrate the Observation of the Transit of\r\nVenus from Two Localities, A and B, on the Earth.]\r\n\r\nThe two transits to which Halley's memorable researches referred\r\noccurred in the years 1761 and 1769. The results of the first were not\r\nvery successful, in spite of the arduous labours of those who undertook\r\nthe observations. The transit of 1769 is of particular interest, not\r\nonly for the determination of the sun's distance, but also because it\r\ngave rise to the first of the celebrated voyages of Captain Cook. It was\r\nto see the transit of Venus that Captain Cook was commissioned to sail\r\nto Otaheite, and there, on the 3rd of June, on a splendid day in that\r\nexquisite climate, the phenomenon was carefully observed and measured by\r\ndifferent observers. Simultaneously with these observations others were\r\nobtained in Europe and elsewhere, and from the combination of all the\r\nobservations an approximate knowledge of the sun's distance was gained.\r\nThe most complete discussion of these observations did not, however,\r\ntake place for some time. It was not until the year 1824 that the\r\nillustrious Encke computed the distance of the sun, and gave as the\r\ndefinite result 95,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nFor many years this number was invariably adopted, and many of the\r\npresent generation will remember how they were taught in their\r\nschool-days that the sun was 95,000,000 miles away. At length doubts\r\nbegan to be whispered as to the accuracy of this result. The doubts\r\narose in different quarters, and were presented with different degrees\r\nof importance; but they all pointed in one direction, they all indicated\r\nthat the distance of the sun was not really so great as the result which\r\nEncke had obtained. It must be remembered that there are several ways of\r\nfinding the distance of the sun, and it will be our duty to allude to\r\nsome other methods later on. It has been ascertained that the result\r\nobtained by Encke from the observations made in 1761 and 1769, with\r\ninstruments inferior to our modern ones, was too great, and that the\r\ndistance of the sun may probably be now stated at 92,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nI venture to record our personal experience of the last transit of\r\nVenus, which we had the good fortune to view from Dunsink Observatory on\r\nthe afternoon of the 6th of December, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the eventful day appeared to be about as unfavourable\r\nfor a grand astronomical spectacle as could well be imagined. Snow, a\r\ncouple of inches thick, covered the ground, and more was falling, with\r\nbut little intermission, all the forenoon. It seemed almost hopeless\r\nthat a view of the phenomenon could be obtained from that observatory;\r\nbut it is well in such cases to bear in mind the injunction given to the\r\nobservers on a celebrated eclipse expedition. They were instructed, no\r\nmatter what the day should be like, that they were to make all their\r\npreparations precisely as they would have done were the sun shining with\r\nundimmed splendour. By this advice no doubt many observers have\r\nprofited; and we acted upon it with very considerable success.\r\n\r\nThere were at that time at the observatory two equatorials, one of them\r\nan old, but tolerably good, instrument, of about six inches aperture;\r\nthe other the great South equatorial, of twelve inches aperture, already\r\nreferred to. At eleven o'clock the day looked worse than ever; but we at\r\nonce proceeded to make all ready. I stationed Mr. Rambaut at the small\r\nequatorial, while I myself took charge of the South instrument. The snow\r\nwas still falling when the domes were opened; but, according to our\r\nprearranged scheme, the telescopes were directed, not indeed upon the\r\nsun, but to the place where we knew the sun was, and the clockwork was\r\nset in motion which carried round the telescopes, still constantly\r\npointing towards the invisible sun. The predicted time of the transit\r\nhad not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nThe eye-piece employed on the South equatorial must also receive a brief\r\nnotice. It will, of course, be obvious that the full glare of the sun\r\nhas to be greatly mitigated before the eye can view it with impunity.\r\nThe light from the sun falls upon a piece of transparent glass inclined\r\nat a certain angle, and the chief portion of the sun's heat, as well as\r\na certain amount of its light, pass through the glass and are lost. A\r\ncertain fraction of the light is, however, reflected from the glass, and\r\nenters the eye-piece. This light is already much reduced in intensity,\r\nbut it undergoes as much further reduction as we please by an ingenious\r\ncontrivance. The glass which reflects the light does so at what is\r\ncalled the polarising angle, and between the eye-piece and the eye is a\r\nplate of tourmaline. This plate of tourmaline can be turned round by the\r\nobserver. In one position it hardly interferes with the polarised light\r\nat all, while in the position at right angles thereto it cuts off nearly\r\nthe whole of it. By simply adjusting the position of the tourmaline, the\r\nobserver has it in his power to render the image of any brightness that\r\nmay be convenient, and thus the observations of the sun can be conducted\r\nwith the appropriate degree of illumination.\r\n\r\nBut such appliances seemed on this occasion to be a mere mockery. The\r\ntourmaline was all ready, but up to one o'clock not a trace of the sun\r\ncould be seen. Shortly after one o'clock, however, we noticed that the\r\nday was getting lighter; and, on looking to the north, whence the wind\r\nand the snow were coming, we saw, to our inexpressible delight, that the\r\nclouds were clearing. At length, the sky towards the south began to\r\nimprove, and at last, as the critical moment approached, we could detect\r\nthe spot where the sun was becoming visible. But the predicted moment\r\narrived and passed, and still the sun had not broken through the clouds,\r\nthough every moment the certainty that it would do so became more\r\napparent. The external contact was therefore missed. We tried to console\r\nourselves by the reflection that this was not, after all, a very\r\nimportant phase, and hoped that the internal contact would be more\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAt length the struggling beams pierced the obstruction, and I saw the\r\nround, sharp disc of the sun in the finder, and eagerly glanced at the\r\npoint on which attention was concentrated. Some minutes had now elapsed\r\nsince the predicted moment of first contact, and, to my delight, I saw\r\nthe small notch in the margin of the sun showing that the transit had\r\ncommenced, and that the planet was then one-third on the sun. But the\r\ncritical moment had not yet arrived. By the expression \"first internal\r\ncontact\" we are to understand the moment when the planet has completely\r\nentered _on_ the sun. This first contact was timed to occur twenty-one\r\nminutes later than the external contact already referred to. But the\r\nclouds again disappointed our hope of seeing the internal contact. While\r\nsteadily looking at the exquisitely beautiful sight of the gradual\r\nadvance of the planet, I became aware that there were other objects\r\nbesides Venus between me and the sun. They were the snowflakes, which\r\nagain began to fall rapidly. I must admit the phenomenon was singularly\r\nbeautiful. The telescopic effect of a snowstorm with the sun as a\r\nbackground I had never before seen. It reminded me of the golden rain\r\nwhich is sometimes seen falling from a flight of sky-rockets during\r\npyrotechnic displays; I would gladly have dispensed with the spectacle,\r\nfor it necessarily followed that the sun and Venus again disappeared\r\nfrom view. The clouds gathered, the snowstorm descended as heavily as\r\never, and we hardly dared to hope that we should see anything more; 1\r\nhr. 57 min. came and passed, the first internal contact was over, and\r\nVenus had fully entered on the sun. We had only obtained a brief view,\r\nand we had not yet been able to make any measurements or other\r\nobservations that could be of service. Still, to have seen even a part\r\nof a transit of Venus is an event to remember for a lifetime, and we\r\nfelt more delight than can be easily expressed at even this slight gleam\r\nof success.\r\n\r\nBut better things were in store. My assistant came over with the report\r\nthat he had also been successful in seeing Venus in the same phase as I\r\nhad. We both resumed our posts, and at half-past two the clouds began to\r\ndisperse, and the prospect of seeing the sun began to improve. It was\r\nnow no question of the observations of contact. Venus by this time was\r\nwell on the sun, and we therefore prepared to make observations with the\r\nmicrometer attached to the eye-piece. The clouds at length dispersed,\r\nand at this time Venus had so completely entered on the sun that the\r\ndistance from the edge of the planet to the edge of the sun was about\r\ntwice the diameter of the planet. We measured the distance of the inner\r\nedge of Venus from the nearest limb of the sun. These observations were\r\nrepeated as frequently as possible, but it should be added that they\r\nwere only made with very considerable difficulty. The sun was now very\r\nlow, and the edges of the sun and of Venus were by no means of that\r\nsteady character which is suitable for micrometrical measurement. The\r\nmargin of the luminary was quivering, and Venus, though no doubt it was\r\nsometimes circular, was very often distorted to such a degree as to make\r\nthe measures very uncertain.\r\n\r\nWe succeeded in obtaining sixteen measures altogether; but the sun was\r\nnow getting low, the clouds began again to interfere, and we saw that\r\nthe pursuit of the transit must be left to the thousands of astronomers\r\nin happier climes who had been eagerly awaiting it. But before the\r\nphenomena had ceased I spared a few minutes from the somewhat mechanical\r\nwork at the micrometer to take a view of the transit in the more\r\npicturesque form which the large field of the finder presented. The sun\r\nwas already beginning to put on the ruddy hues of sunset, and there, far\r\nin on its face, was the sharp, round, black disc of Venus. It was then\r\neasy to sympathise with the supreme joy of Horrocks, when, in 1639, he\r\nfor the first time witnessed this spectacle. The intrinsic interest of\r\nthe phenomenon, its rarity, the fulfilment of the prediction, the noble\r\nproblem which the transit of Venus helps us to solve, are all present to\r\nour thoughts when we look at this pleasing picture, a repetition of\r\nwhich will not occur again until the flowers are blooming in the June of\r\nA.D. 2004.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of a transit of Venus also affords an opportunity of\r\nstudying the physical nature of the planet, and we may here briefly\r\nindicate the results that have been obtained. In the first place, a\r\ntransit will throw some light on the question as to whether Venus is\r\naccompanied by a satellite. If Venus were attended by a small body in\r\nclose proximity, it would be conceivable that in ordinary circumstances\r\nthe brilliancy of the planet would obliterate the feeble beam of rays\r\nfrom the minute companion, and thus the satellite would remain\r\nundiscovered. It was therefore a matter of great interest to scrutinise\r\nthe vicinity of the planet while in the act of transit. If a satellite\r\nexisted--and the existence of one or more of such bodies has often been\r\nsuspected--then it would be capable of detection against the brilliant\r\nbackground of the sun. Special attention was directed to this point\r\nduring the recent transits, but no satellite of Venus was to be found.\r\nIt seems, therefore, to be very unlikely that Venus can be attended by\r\nany companion globe of appreciable dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe observations directed to the investigation of the atmosphere\r\nsurrounding Venus have been more successful. If the planet were devoid\r\nof an atmosphere, then it would be totally invisible just before\r\ncommencing to enter on the sun, and would relapse into total\r\ninvisibility as soon as it had left the sun. The observations made\r\nduring the transits are not in conformity with such suppositions.\r\nSpecial attention has been directed to this point during the recent\r\ntransits. The result has been very remarkable, and has proved in the\r\nmost conclusive manner the existence of an atmosphere around Venus. As\r\nthe planet gradually moved off the sun, the circular edge of the planet\r\nextending out into the darkness was seen to be bounded by a circular arc\r\nof light, and Dr. Copeland, who observed this transit in very favourable\r\ncircumstances, was actually able to follow the planet until it had\r\npassed entirely away from the sun, at which time the globe, though\r\nitself invisible, was distinctly marked by the girdle of light by which\r\nit was surrounded. This luminous circle is inexplicable save by the\r\nsupposition that the globe of Venus is surrounded by an atmospheric\r\nshell in the same way as the earth.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, what is the advantage of devoting so much time and\r\nlabour to a celestial phenomenon like the transit of Venus which has so\r\nlittle bearing on practical affairs? What does it matter whether the sun\r\nbe 95,000,000 miles off, or whether it be only 93,000,000, or any other\r\ndistance? We must admit at once that the enquiry has but a slender\r\nbearing on matters of practical utility. No doubt a fanciful person\r\nmight contend that to compute our nautical almanacs with perfect\r\naccuracy we require a precise knowledge of the distance of the sun. Our\r\nvast commerce depends on skilful navigation, and one factor necessary\r\nfor success is the reliability of the \"Nautical Almanac.\" The increased\r\nperfection of the almanac must therefore bear some relation to increased\r\nperfection in navigation. Now, as good authorities tell us that in\r\nrunning for a harbour on a tempestuous night, or in other critical\r\nemergencies, even a yard of sea-room is often of great consequence, so\r\nit may conceivably happen that to the infinitesimal influence of the\r\ntransit of Venus on the \"Nautical Almanac\" is due the safety of a\r\ngallant vessel.\r\n\r\nBut the time, the labour, and the money expended in observing the\r\ntransit of Venus are really to be defended on quite different grounds.\r\nWe see in it a fruitful source of information. It tells us the distance\r\nof the sun, which is the foundation of all the great measurements of the\r\nuniverse. It gratifies the intellectual curiosity of man by a view of\r\nthe true dimensions of the majestic solar system, in which the earth is\r\nseen to play a dignified, though still subordinate, part; and it leads\r\nus to a conception of the stupendous scale on which the universe is\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for us, with a due regard to the limits of this\r\nvolume, to protract any longer our discussion of the transit of Venus.\r\nWhen we begin to study the details of the observations, we are\r\nimmediately confronted with a multitude of technical and intricate\r\nmatters. Unfortunately, there are very great difficulties in making the\r\nobservations with the necessary precision. The moments when Venus enters\r\non and leaves the solar disc cannot be very accurately observed, partly\r\nowing to a peculiar optical illusion known as \"the black drop,\" whereby\r\nVenus seems to cling to the sun's limb for many seconds, partly owing to\r\nthe influence of the planet's atmosphere, which helps to make the\r\nobserved time of contact uncertain. These circumstances make it\r\ndifficult to determine the distance of the sun from observations of\r\ntransits of Venus with the accuracy which modern science requires. It\r\nseems therefore likely that the final determination of the sun's\r\ndistance will be obtained in quite a different manner. This will be\r\nexplained in Chapter XI., and hence we feel the less reluctance in\r\npassing any from the consideration of the transit of Venus as a method\r\nof celestial surveying.\r\n\r\nWe must now close our description of this lovely planet; but before\r\ndoing so, let us add--or in some cases repeat--a few statistical facts\r\nas to the size and the dimensions of the planet and its orbit.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of Venus is about 7,660 miles, and the planet shows no\r\nmeasurable departure from the globular form, though we can hardly doubt\r\nthat its polar diameter must really be somewhat shorter than the\r\nequatorial diameter. This diameter is only about 258 miles less than\r\nthat of the earth. The mass of Venus is about three-quarters of the mass\r\nof the earth; or if, as is more usual, we compare the mass of Venus with\r\nthe sun, it is to be represented by the fraction 1 divided by 425,000.\r\nIt is to be observed that the mass of Venus is not quite so great in\r\ncomparison with its bulk as might have been expected. The density of\r\nthis planet is about 0·850 of that of the earth. Venus would weigh 4·81\r\ntimes as much as a globe of water of equal size. The gravitation at its\r\nsurface will, to a slight extent, be less than the gravitation at the\r\nsurface of the earth. A body here falls sixteen feet in a second; a body\r\nlet fall at the surface of Venus would fall about three feet less. It\r\nseems not unlikely that the time of rotation of Venus may be equal to\r\nthe period of its revolution around the sun.\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Venus is remarkable for the close approach which it makes\r\nto a circle. The greatest distance of this planet from the sun does not\r\nexceed the least distance by one per cent. Its mean distance from the\r\nsun is about 67,000,000 miles, and the movement in the orbit amounts to\r\na mean velocity of nearly 22 miles per second, the entire journey being\r\naccomplished in 224·70 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Earth is a great Globe--How the Size of the Earth is\r\n     Measured--The Base Line--The Latitude found by the Elevation of the\r\n     Pole--A Degree of the Meridian--The Earth not a Sphere--The\r\n     Pendulum Experiment--Is the Motion of the Earth slow or\r\n     fast?--Coincidence of the Axis of Rotation and the Axis of\r\n     Figure--The Existence of Heat in the Earth--The Earth once in a\r\n     Soft Condition--Effects of Centrifugal Force--Comparison with the\r\n     Sun and Jupiter--The Protuberance of the Equator--The Weighing of\r\n     the Earth--Comparison between the Weight of the Earth and an equal\r\n     Globe of Water--Comparison of the Earth with a Leaden Globe--The\r\n     Pendulum--Use of the Pendulum in Measuring the Intensity of\r\n     Gravitation--The Principle of Isochronism--Shape of the Earth\r\n     measured by the Pendulum.\r\n\r\nThat the earth must be a round body is a truth immediately suggested by\r\nsimple astronomical considerations. The sun is round, the moon is round,\r\nand telescopes show that the planets are round. No doubt comets are not\r\nround, but then a comet seems to be in no sense a solid body. We can see\r\nright through one of these frail objects, and its weight is too small\r\nfor our methods of measurement to appreciate. If, then, all the solid\r\nbodies we can see are round globes, is it not likely that the earth is a\r\nglobe also? But we have far more direct information than mere surmise.\r\n\r\nThere is no better way of actually seeing that the surface of the ocean\r\nis curved than by watching a distant ship on the open sea. When the ship\r\nis a long way off and is still receding, its hull will gradually\r\ndisappear, while the masts will remain visible. On a fine summer's day\r\nwe can often see the top of the funnel of a steamer appearing above the\r\nsea, while the body of the steamer is below. To see this best the eye\r\nshould be brought as close as possible to the surface of the sea. If the\r\nsea were perfectly flat, there would be nothing to obscure the body of\r\nthe vessel, and it would therefore be visible so long as the funnel\r\nremains visible. If the sea be really curved, the protuberant part\r\nintercepts the view of the hull, while the funnel is still to be seen.\r\n\r\nWe thus learn how the sea is curved at every part, and therefore it is\r\nnatural to suppose that the earth is a sphere. When we make more careful\r\nmeasurements we find that the globe is not perfectly round. It is\r\nflattened to some extent at each of the poles. This may be easily\r\nillustrated by an indiarubber ball, which can be compressed on two\r\nopposite sides so as to bulge out at the centre. The earth is similarly\r\nflattened at the poles, and bulged out at the equator. The divergence of\r\nthe earth from the truly globular form is, however, not very great, and\r\nwould not be noticed without very careful measurements.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the size of the earth involves operations of no\r\nlittle delicacy. Very much skill and very much labour have been devoted\r\nto the work, and the dimensions of the earth are known with a high\r\ndegree of accuracy, though perhaps not with all the precision that we\r\nmay ultimately hope to attain. The scientific importance of an accurate\r\nmeasurement of the earth can hardly be over-estimated. The radius of the\r\nearth is itself the unit in which many other astronomical magnitudes are\r\nexpressed. For example, when observations are made with the view of\r\nfinding the distance of the moon, the observations, when discussed and\r\nreduced, tell us that the distance of the moon is equal to fifty-nine\r\ntimes the equatorial radius of the earth. If we want to find the\r\ndistance of the moon in miles, we require to know the number of miles in\r\nthe earth's radius.\r\n\r\nA level part of the earth's surface having been chosen, a line a few\r\nmiles long is measured. This is called the base, and as all the\r\nsubsequent measures depend ultimately on the base, it is necessary that\r\nthis measurement shall be made with scrupulous accuracy. To measure a\r\nline four or five miles long with such precision as to exclude any\r\nerrors greater than a few inches demands the most minute precautions. We\r\ndo not now enter upon a description of the operations that are\r\nnecessary. It is a most laborious piece of work, and many ponderous\r\nvolumes have been devoted to the discussion of the results. But when a\r\nfew base lines have been obtained in different places on the earth's\r\nsurface, the measuring rods are to be laid aside, and the subsequent\r\ntask of the survey of the earth is to be conducted by the measurement of\r\nangles from one station to another and trigonometrical calculations\r\nbased thereon. Starting from a base line a few miles long, distances of\r\ngreater length are calculated, until at length stretches 100 miles long,\r\nor even more, can be accomplished. It is thus possible to find the\r\nlength of a long line running due north and south.\r\n\r\nSo far the work has been merely that of the terrestrial surveyor. The\r\ndistance thus ascertained is handed over to the astronomer to deduce\r\nfrom it the dimensions of the earth. The astronomer fixes his\r\nobservatory at the northern end of the long line, and proceeds to\r\ndetermine his latitude by observation. There are various ways by which\r\nthis can be accomplished. They will be found fully described in works on\r\npractical astronomy. We shall here only indicate in a very brief manner\r\nthe principle on which such observations are to be made.\r\n\r\nEveryone ought to be familiar with the Pole Star, which, though by no\r\nmeans the most brilliant, is probably the most important star in the\r\nwhole heavens. In these latitudes we are accustomed to find the Pole\r\nStar at a considerable elevation, and there we can invariably find it,\r\nalways in the same place in the northern sky. But suppose we start on a\r\nvoyage to the southern hemisphere: as we approach the equator we find,\r\nnight after night, the Pole Star coming closer to the horizon. At the\r\nequator it is on the horizon; while if we cross the line, we find on\r\nentering the southern hemisphere that this useful celestial body has\r\nbecome invisible. This is in itself sufficient to show us that the earth\r\ncannot be the flat surface that untutored experience seems to indicate.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a traveller leaving England for Norway observes that\r\nthe Pole Star is every night higher in the heavens than he has been\r\naccustomed to see it. If he extend his journey farther north, the same\r\nobject will gradually rise higher and higher, until at length, when\r\napproaching the pole of the earth, the Pole Star is high up over his\r\nhead. We are thus led to perceive that the higher our latitude, the\r\nhigher, in general, is the elevation of the Pole Star. But we cannot use\r\nprecise language until we replace the twinkling point by the pole of the\r\nheavens itself. The pole of the heavens is near the Pole Star, which\r\nitself revolves around the pole of the heavens, as all the other stars\r\ndo, once every day. The circle described by the Pole Star is, however,\r\nso small that, unless we give it special attention, the motion will not\r\nbe perceived. The true pole is not a visible point, but it is capable of\r\nbeing accurately defined, and it enables us to state with the utmost\r\nprecision the relation between the pole and the latitude. The statement\r\nis, that the elevation of the pole above the horizon is equal to the\r\nlatitude of the place.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer stationed at one end of the long line measures the\r\nelevation of the pole above the horizon. This is an operation of some\r\ndelicacy. In the first place, as the pole is invisible, he has to obtain\r\nits position indirectly. He measures the altitude of the Pole Star when\r\nthat altitude is greatest, and repeats the operation twelve hours later,\r\nwhen the altitude of the Pole Star is least; the mean between the two,\r\nwhen corrected in various ways which it is not necessary for us now to\r\ndiscuss, gives the true altitude of the pole. Suffice it to say that by\r\nsuch operations the latitude of one end of the line is determined. The\r\nastronomer then, with all his equipment of instruments, moves to the\r\nother end of the line. He there repeats the process, and he finds that\r\nthe pole has now a different elevation, corresponding to the different\r\nlatitude. The difference of the two elevations thus gives him an\r\naccurate measure of the number of degrees and fractional parts of a\r\ndegree between the latitudes of the two stations. This can be compared\r\nwith the actual distance in miles between the two stations, which has\r\nbeen ascertained by the trigonometrical survey. A simple calculation\r\nwill then show the number of miles and fractional parts of a mile\r\ncorresponding to one degree of latitude--or, as it is more usually\r\nexpressed, the length of a degree of the meridian.\r\n\r\nThis operation has to be repeated in different parts of the earth--in\r\nthe northern hemisphere and in the southern, in high latitudes and in\r\nlow. If the sea-level over the entire earth were a perfect sphere, an\r\nimportant consequence would follow--the length of a degree of the\r\nmeridian would be everywhere the same. It would be the same in Peru as\r\nin Sweden, the same in India as in England. But the lengths of the\r\ndegrees are not all the same, and hence we learn that our earth is not\r\nreally a sphere. The measured lengths of the degrees enable us to see to\r\nwhat extent the shape of the earth departs from a perfect sphere. Near\r\nthe pole the length of a degree is longer than near the equator. This\r\nshows that the earth is flattened at the poles and protuberant at the\r\nequator, and it provides the means by which we may calculate the actual\r\nlengths of the polar and the equatorial axes. In this way the equatorial\r\ndiameter has been found equal to 7,927 miles, while the polar diameter\r\nis 27 miles shorter.\r\n\r\nThe polar axis of the earth may be defined as the diameter about which\r\nthe earth rotates. This axis intersects the surface at the north and\r\nsouth poles. The time which the earth occupies in making a complete\r\nrotation around this axis is called a sidereal day. The sidereal day is\r\na little shorter than the ordinary day, being only 23 hours, 56 minutes,\r\nand 4 seconds. The rotation is performed just as if a rigid axis passed\r\nthrough the centre of the earth; or, to use the old and homely\r\nillustration, the earth rotates just as a ball of worsted may be made to\r\nrotate around a knitting-needle thrust through its centre.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy circumstance that the axis about which the earth\r\nrotates occupies a position identical with that of the shortest diameter\r\nof the earth as found by actual surveying. This is a coincidence which\r\nwould be utterly inconceivable if the shape of the earth was not in some\r\nway physically connected with the fact that the earth is rotating. What\r\nconnection can then be traced? Let us enquire into the subject, and we\r\nshall find that the shape of the earth is a consequence of its rotation.\r\n\r\nThe earth at the present time is subject, at various localities, to\r\noccasional volcanic outbreaks. The phenomena of such eruptions, the\r\nallied occurrence of earthquakes, the well-known fact that the heat\r\nincreases the deeper we descend into the earth, the existence of hot\r\nsprings, the geysers found in Iceland and elsewhere, all testify to the\r\nfact that heat exists in the interior of the earth. Whether that heat\r\nbe, as some suppose, universal in the interior of the earth, or whether\r\nit be merely local at the several places where its manifestations are\r\nfelt, is a matter which need not now concern us. All that is necessary\r\nfor our present purpose is the admission that heat is present to some\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThis internal heat, be it much or little, has obviously a different\r\norigin from the heat which we know on the surface. The heat we enjoy is\r\nderived from the sun. The internal heat cannot have been derived from\r\nthe sun; its intensity is far too great, and there are other insuperable\r\ndifficulties attending the supposition that it has come from the sun.\r\nWhere, then, has this heat come from? This is a question which at\r\npresent we can hardly answer--nor, indeed, does it much concern our\r\nargument that we should answer it. The fact being admitted that the heat\r\nis there, all that we require is to apply one or two of the well-known\r\nthermal laws to the interpretation of the facts. We have first to\r\nconsider the general principle by which heat tends to diffuse itself and\r\nspread away from its original source. The heat, deep-seated in the\r\ninterior of the earth, is transmitted through the superincumbent rocks,\r\nand slowly reaches the surface. It is true that the rocks and materials\r\nwith which our earth is covered are not good conductors of heat; most of\r\nthem are, indeed, extremely inefficient in this way; but, good or bad,\r\nthey are in some shape conductors, and through them the heat must creep\r\nto the surface.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be urged against this conclusion that we do not feel this\r\nheat. A few feet of brickwork will so confine the heat of a mighty blast\r\nfurnace that but little will escape through the bricks; but _some_ heat\r\ndoes escape, and the bricks have never been made, and never could be\r\nmade, which would absolutely intercept all the heat. If a few feet of\r\nbrickwork can thus nearly mask the heat of a furnace, cannot some scores\r\nof miles of rock nearly mask the heat in the depths of the earth, even\r\nthough that heat were seven times hotter than the mightiest furnace that\r\never existed? The heat would escape slowly, and perhaps imperceptibly,\r\nbut, unless all our knowledge of nature is a delusion, no rocks, however\r\nthick, can prevent, in the course of time, the leakage of the heat to\r\nthe surface. When this heat arrives at the surface of the earth it must,\r\nin virtue of another thermal law, gradually radiate away and be lost to\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nIt would lead us too far to discuss fully the objections which may\r\nperhaps be raised against what we have here stated. It is often said\r\nthat the heat in the interior of the earth is being produced by chemical\r\ncombination or by mechanical process, and thus that the heat may be\r\nconstantly renewed as fast or even faster than it escapes. This,\r\nhowever, is more a difference in form than in substance. If heat be\r\nproduced in the way just supposed (and there can be no doubt that there\r\nmay be such an origin for some of the heat in the interior of the globe)\r\nthere must be a certain expenditure of chemical or mechanical energies\r\nthat produces a certain exhaustion. For every unit of heat which escapes\r\nthere will either be a loss of an unit of heat from the globe, or, what\r\ncomes nearly to the same thing, a loss of an unit of heat-making power\r\nfrom the chemical or the mechanical energies. The substantial result is\r\nthe same; the heat, actual or potential, of the earth must be\r\ndecreasing. It should, of course, be observed that a great part of the\r\nthermal losses experienced by the earth is of an obvious character, and\r\nnot dependent upon the slow processes of conduction. Each outburst of a\r\nvolcano discharges a stupendous quantity of heat, which disappears very\r\nspeedily from the earth; while in the hot springs found in so many\r\nplaces there is a perennial discharge of the same kind, which in the\r\ncourse of years attains enormous proportions.\r\n\r\nThe earth is thus losing heat, while it never acquires any fresh\r\nsupplies of the same kind to replace the losses. The consequence is\r\nobvious; the interior of the earth must be growing colder. No doubt this\r\nis an extremely slow process; the life of an individual, the life of a\r\nnation, perhaps the life of the human race itself, has not been long\r\nenough to witness any pronounced change in the store of terrestrial\r\nheat. But the law is inevitable, and though the decline in heat may be\r\nslow, yet it is continuous, and in the lapse of ages must necessarily\r\nproduce great and important results.\r\n\r\nIt is not our present purpose to offer any forecast as to the changes\r\nwhich must necessarily arise from this process. We wish at present\r\nrather to look back into past time and see what consequences we may\r\nlegitimately infer. Such intervals of time as we are familiar with in\r\nordinary life, or even in ordinary history, are for our present purpose\r\nquite inappreciable. As our earth is daily losing internal heat, or the\r\nequivalent of heat, it must have contained more heat yesterday than it\r\ndoes to-day, more last year than this year, more twenty years ago than\r\nten years ago. The effect has not been appreciable in historic time; but\r\nwhen we rise from hundreds of years to thousands of years, from\r\nthousands of years to hundreds of thousands of years, and from hundreds\r\nof thousands of years to millions of years, the effect is not only\r\nappreciable, but even of startling magnitude.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a time when the earth contained much more heat than\r\nat present. There must have been a time when the surface of the earth\r\nwas sensibly hot from this source. We cannot pretend to say how many\r\nthousands or millions of years ago this epoch must have been; but we may\r\nbe sure that earlier still the earth was even hotter, until at length we\r\nseem to see the temperature increase to a red heat, from a red heat we\r\nlook back to a still earlier age when the earth was white hot, back\r\nfurther till we find the surface of our now solid globe was actually\r\nmolten. We need not push the retrospect any further at present, still\r\nless is it necessary for us to attempt to assign the probable origin of\r\nthat heat. This, it will be observed, is not required in our argument.\r\nWe find heat now, and we know that heat is being lost every day. From\r\nthis the conclusion that we have already drawn seems inevitable, and\r\nthus we are conducted back to some remote epoch in the abyss of time\r\npast when our solid earth was a globe molten and soft throughout.\r\n\r\nA dewdrop on the petal of a flower is nearly globular; but it is not\r\nquite a globe, because the gravitation presses it against the flower and\r\nsomewhat distorts the shape. A falling drop of rain is a globe; a drop\r\nof oil suspended in a liquid with which it does not mix forms a globe.\r\nPassing from small things to great things, let us endeavour to conceive\r\na stupendous globe of molten matter. Let that globe be as large as the\r\nearth, and let its materials be so soft as to obey the forces of\r\nattraction exerted by each part of the globe on all the other parts.\r\nThere can be no doubt as to the effect of these attractions; they would\r\ntend to smooth down any irregularities on the surface just in the same\r\nway as the surface of the ocean is smooth when freed from the disturbing\r\ninfluences of the wind. We might, therefore, expect that our molten\r\nglobe, isolated from all external interference, would assume the form of\r\na sphere.\r\n\r\nBut now suppose that this great sphere, which we have hitherto assumed\r\nto be at rest, is made to rotate round an axis passing through its\r\ncentre. We need not suppose that this axis is a material object, nor are\r\nwe concerned with any supposition as to how the velocity of rotation was\r\ncaused. We can, however, easily see what the consequence of the rotation\r\nwould be. The sphere would become deformed, the centrifugal force would\r\nmake the molten body bulge out at the equator and flatten down at the\r\npoles. The greater the velocity of rotation the greater would be the\r\nbulging. To each velocity of rotation a certain degree of bulging would\r\nbe appropriate. The molten earth thus bulged out to an extent which was\r\ndependent upon the fact that it turned round once a day. Now suppose\r\nthat the earth, while still rotating, commences to pass from the liquid\r\nto the solid state. The form which the earth would assume on\r\nconsolidation would, no doubt, be very irregular on the surface; it\r\nwould be irregular in consequence of the upheavals and the outbursts\r\nincident to the transformation of so mighty a mass of matter; but\r\nirregular though it be, we can be sure that, on the whole, the form of\r\nthe earth's surface would coincide with the shape which it had assumed\r\nby the movement of rotation. Hence we can explain the protuberant form\r\nof the equator of the earth, and we can appeal to that form in\r\ncorroboration of the view that this globe was once in a soft or molten\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe argument may be supported and illustrated by comparing the shape of\r\nour earth with the shapes of some of the other celestial bodies. The\r\nsun, for instance, seems to be almost a perfect globe. No measures that\r\nwe can make show that the polar diameter of the sun is shorter than the\r\nequatorial diameter. But this is what we might have expected. No doubt\r\nthe sun is rotating on its axis, and, as it is the rotation that causes\r\nthe protuberance, why should not the rotation have deformed the sun like\r\nthe earth? The probability is that a difference really does exist\r\nbetween the two diameters of the sun, but that the difference is too\r\nsmall for us to measure. It is impossible not to connect this with the\r\n_slowness_ of the sun's rotation. The sun takes twenty-five days to\r\ncomplete a rotation, and the protuberance appropriate to so low a\r\nvelocity is not appreciable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when we look at one of the quickly-rotating planets,\r\nwe obtain a very different result. Let us take the very striking\r\ninstance which is presented in the great planet Jupiter. Viewed in the\r\ntelescope, Jupiter is at once seen not to be a globe. The difference is\r\nso conspicuous that accurate measures are not necessary to show that the\r\npolar diameter of Jupiter is shorter than the equatorial diameter. The\r\ndeparture of Jupiter from the truly spherical shape is indeed much\r\ngreater than the departure of the earth. It is impossible not to connect\r\nthis with the much more rapid rotation of Jupiter. We shall presently\r\nhave to devote a chapter to the consideration of this splendid orb. We\r\nmay, however, so far anticipate what we shall then say as to state that\r\nthe time of Jupiter's rotation is under ten hours, and this\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that Jupiter is more than one thousand times\r\ngreater than the earth. His enormously rapid rotation has caused him to\r\nbulge out at the equator to a remarkable extent.\r\n\r\nThe survey of our earth and the measurement of its dimensions having\r\nbeen accomplished, the next operation for the astronomer is the\r\ndetermination of its weight. Here, indeed, is a problem which taxes the\r\nresources of science to the very uttermost. Of the interior of the earth\r\nwe know little--I might almost say we know nothing. No doubt we sink\r\ndeep mines into the earth. These mines enable us to penetrate half a\r\nmile, or even a whole mile, into the depths of the interior. But this\r\nis, after all, only a most insignificant attempt to explore the interior\r\nof the earth. What is an advance of one mile in comparison with the\r\ndistance to the centre of the earth? It is only about one\r\nfour-thousandth part of the whole. Our knowledge of the earth merely\r\nreaches to an utterly insignificant depth below the surface, and we have\r\nnot a conception of what may be the nature of our globe only a few miles\r\nbelow where we are standing. Seeing, then, our almost complete ignorance\r\nof the solid contents of the earth, does it not seem a hopeless task to\r\nattempt to weigh the entire globe? Yet that problem has been solved, and\r\nthe result is known--not, indeed, with the accuracy attained in other\r\nastronomical researches, but still with tolerable approximation.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to enunciate the weight of the earth in our ordinary\r\nunits. The enumeration of billions of tons does not convey any distinct\r\nimpression. It is a far more natural course to compare the mass of the\r\nearth with that of an equal globe of water. We should be prepared to\r\nfind that our earth was heavier than a like volume of water. The rocks\r\nwhich form its surface are heavier, bulk for bulk, than the oceans which\r\nrepose on those rocks. The abundance of metals in the earth, the gradual\r\nincrease in the density of the earth, which must arise from the enormous\r\npressure at great depths--all these considerations will prepare us to\r\nlearn that the earth is very much heavier than a globe of water of equal\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nNewton supposed that the earth was between five and six times as heavy\r\nas an equal bulk of water. Nor is it hard to see that such a suggestion\r\nis plausible. The rocks and materials on the surface are usually about\r\ntwo or three times as heavy as water, but the density of the interior\r\nmust be much greater. There is good reason to believe that down in the\r\nremote depths of the earth there is a very large proportion of iron. An\r\niron earth would weigh about seven times as much as an equal globe of\r\nwater. We are thus led to see that the earth's weight must be probably\r\nmore than three, and probably less than seven, times an equal globe of\r\nwater; and hence, in fixing the density between five and six, Newton\r\nadopted a result plausible at the moment, and since shown to be probably\r\ncorrect. Several methods have been proposed by which this important\r\nquestion can be solved with accuracy. Of all these methods we shall here\r\nonly describe one, because it illustrates, in a very remarkable manner,\r\nthe law of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Gravitation it was pointed out that the intensity of\r\nthis force between two masses of moderate dimensions was extremely\r\nminute, and the difficulty in weighing the earth arises from this cause.\r\nThe practical application of the process is encumbered by multitudinous\r\ndetails, which it will be unnecessary for us to consider at present. The\r\nprinciple of the process is simple enough. To give definiteness to our\r\ndescription, let us conceive a large globe about two feet in diameter;\r\nand as it is desirable for this globe to be as heavy as possible, let us\r\nsuppose it to be made of lead. A small globe brought near the large one\r\nis attracted by the force of gravitation. The amount of this attraction\r\nis extremely small, but, nevertheless, it can be measured by a refined\r\nprocess which renders extremely small forces sensible. The intensity of\r\nthe attraction depends both on the masses of the globes and on their\r\ndistance apart, as well as on the force of gravitation. We can also\r\nreadily measure the attraction of the earth upon the small globe. This\r\nis, in fact, nothing more nor less than the weight of the small globe in\r\nthe ordinary acceptation of the word. We can thus compare the\r\nattraction exerted by the leaden globe with the attraction exerted by\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nIf the centre of the earth and the centre of the leaden globe were at\r\nthe same distance from the attracted body, then the intensity of their\r\nattractions would give at once the ratio of their masses by simple\r\nproportion. In this case, however, matters are not so simple: the leaden\r\nball is only distant by a few inches from the attracted ball, while the\r\ncentre of the earth's attraction is nearly 4,000 miles away at the\r\ncentre of the earth. Allowance has to be made for this difference, and\r\nthe attraction of the leaden sphere has to be reduced to what it would\r\nbe were it removed to a distance of 4,000 miles. This can fortunately be\r\neffected by a simple calculation depending upon the general law that the\r\nintensity of gravitation varies inversely as the square of the distance.\r\nWe can thus, partly by calculation and partly by experiment, compare the\r\nintensity of the attraction of the leaden sphere with the attraction of\r\nthe earth. It is known that the attractions are proportional to the\r\nmasses, so that the comparative masses of the earth and of the leaden\r\nsphere have been measured; and it has been ascertained that the earth is\r\nabout half as heavy as a globe of lead of equal size would be. We may\r\nthus state finally that the mass of the earth is about five and a half\r\ntimes as great as the mass of a globe of water equal to it in bulk.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Gravitation we have mentioned the fact that a body let\r\nfall near the surface of the earth drops through sixteen feet in the\r\nfirst second. This distance varies slightly at different parts of the\r\nearth. If the earth were a perfect sphere, then the attraction would be\r\nthe same at every part, and the body would fall through the same\r\ndistance everywhere. The earth is not round, so the distance which the\r\nbody falls in one second differs slightly at different places. At the\r\npole the radius of the earth is shorter than at the equator, and\r\naccordingly the attraction of the earth at the pole is greater than at\r\nthe equator. Had we accurate measurements showing the distance a body\r\nwould fall in one second both at the pole and at the equator, we should\r\nhave the means of ascertaining the shape of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, difficult to measure correctly the distance a body will\r\nfall in one second. We have, therefore, been obliged to resort to other\r\nmeans for determining the force of attraction of the earth at the\r\nequator and other accessible parts of its surface. The methods adopted\r\nare founded on the pendulum, which is, perhaps, the simplest and\r\ncertainly one of the most useful of philosophical instruments. The ideal\r\npendulum is a small and heavy weight suspended from a fixed point by a\r\nfine and flexible wire. If we draw the pendulum aside from its vertical\r\nposition and then release it, the weight will swing to and fro.\r\n\r\nFor its journey to and fro the pendulum requires a small period of time.\r\nIt is very remarkable that this period does not depend appreciably on\r\nthe length of the circular arc through which the pendulum swings. To\r\nverify this law we suspend another pendulum beside the first, both being\r\nof the same length. If we draw both pendulums aside and then release\r\nthem, they swing together and return together. This might have been\r\nexpected. But if we draw one pendulum a great deal to one side, and the\r\nother only a little, the two pendulums still swing sympathetically.\r\nThis, perhaps, would not have been expected. Try it again, with even a\r\nstill greater difference in the arc of vibration, and still we see the\r\ntwo weights occupy the same time for the swing.\r\n\r\nWe can vary the experiment in another way. Let us change the weights on\r\nthe pendulums, so that they are of unequal size, though both of iron.\r\nShall we find any difference in the periods of vibration? We try again:\r\nthe period is the same as before; swing them through different arcs,\r\nlarge or small, the period is still the same. But it may be said that\r\nthis is due to the fact that both weights are of the same material. Try\r\nit again, using a leaden weight instead of one of the iron weights; the\r\nresult is identical. Even with a ball of wood the period of oscillation\r\nis the same as that of the ball of iron, and this is true no matter what\r\nbe the arc through which the vibration takes place.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we change the _length_ of the wire by which the weight is\r\nsupported, then the period will not remain unchanged. This can be very\r\neasily illustrated. Take a short pendulum with a wire only one-fourth of\r\nthe length of that of the long one; suspend the two close together, and\r\ncompare the periods of vibration of the short pendulum with that of the\r\nlong one, and we find that the former has a period only half that of the\r\nlatter. We may state the result generally, and say that the time of\r\nvibration of a pendulum is proportional to the square root of its\r\nlength. If we quadruple the length of the suspending cord we double the\r\ntime of its vibration; if we increase the length of the pendulum\r\nninefold, we increase its period of vibration threefold.\r\n\r\nIt is the gravitation of the earth which makes the pendulum swing. The\r\ngreater the attraction, the more rapidly will the pendulum oscillate.\r\nThis may be easily accounted for. If the earth pulls the weight down\r\nvery vigorously, the time will be short; if the power of the earth's\r\nattraction be lessened, then it cannot pull the weight down so quickly,\r\nand the period will be lengthened.\r\n\r\nThe time of vibration of the pendulum can be determined with great\r\naccuracy. Let it swing for 10,000 oscillations, and measure the time\r\nthat these oscillations have consumed. The arc through which the\r\npendulum swings may not have remained quite constant, but this does not\r\nappreciably affect the _time_ of its oscillation. Suppose that an error\r\nof a second is made in the determination of the time of 10,000\r\noscillations; this will only entail an error of the ten-thousandth part\r\nof the second in the time of a single oscillation, and will afford a\r\ncorrespondingly accurate determination of the force of gravity at the\r\nplace where the experiment was made.\r\n\r\nTake a pendulum to the equator. Let it perform 10,000 oscillations, and\r\ndetermine carefully the _time_ that these oscillations have required.\r\nBring the same pendulum to another part of the earth, and repeat the\r\nexperiment. We have thus a means of comparing the gravitation at the two\r\nplaces. There are, no doubt, a multitude of precautions to be observed\r\nwhich need not here concern us. It is not necessary to enter into\r\ndetails as to the manner in which the motion of the pendulum is to be\r\nsustained, nor as to the effect of changes of temperature in the\r\nalteration of its length. It will suffice for us to see how the time of\r\nthe pendulum's swing can be measured accurately, and how from that\r\nmeasurement the intensity of gravitation can be calculated.\r\n\r\nThe pendulum thus enables us to make a gravitational survey of the\r\nsurface of the earth with the highest degree of accuracy. We cannot,\r\nhowever, infer that gravity alone affects the oscillations of the\r\npendulum. We have seen how the earth rotates on its axis, and we have\r\nattributed the bulging of the earth at the equator to this influence.\r\nBut the centrifugal force arising from the rotation has the effect of\r\ndecreasing the apparent weight of bodies, and the change is greatest at\r\nthe equator, and lessens gradually as we approach the poles. From this\r\ncause alone the attraction of the pendulum at the equator is less than\r\nelsewhere, and therefore the oscillations of the pendulum will take a\r\nlonger time there than at other localities. A part of the apparent\r\nchange in gravitation is accordingly due to the centrifugal force; but\r\nthere is, in addition, a real alteration.\r\n\r\nIn a work on astronomy it does not come within our scope to enter into\r\nfurther detail on the subject of our planet. The surface of the earth,\r\nits contour and its oceans, its mountain chains and its rivers, are for\r\nthe physical geographer; while its rocks and their contents, its\r\nvolcanoes and its earthquakes, are to be studied by the geologists and\r\nthe physicists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Our nearer Neighbours in the Heavens--Surface of Mars can be\r\n     Examined in the Telescope--Remarkable Orbit of Mars--Resemblance of\r\n     Mars to a Star--Meaning of Opposition--The Eccentricity of the\r\n     Orbit of Mars--Different Oppositions of Mars--Apparent Movements of\r\n     the Planet--Effect of the Earth's Movement--Measurement of the\r\n     Distance of Mars--Theoretical Investigation of the Sun's\r\n     Distance--Drawings of the Planet--Is there Snow on Mars?--The\r\n     Rotation of the Planet--Gravitation on Mars--Has Mars any\r\n     Satellites?--Prof. Asaph Hall's great Discovery--The Revolutions of\r\n     the Satellites--Deimos and Phobos--\"Gulliver's Travels.\"\r\n\r\nThe special relation in which we stand to one planet of our system has\r\nnecessitated a somewhat different treatment of that globe from the\r\ntreatment appropriate to the others. We discussed Mercury and Venus as\r\ndistant objects known chiefly by telescopic research, and by\r\ncalculations of which astronomical observations were the foundation. Our\r\nknowledge of the earth is of a different character, and attained in a\r\ndifferent way. Yet it was necessary for symmetry that we should discuss\r\nthe earth after the planet Venus, in order to give to the earth its true\r\nposition in the solar system. But now that the earth has been passed in\r\nour outward progress from the sun, we come to the planet Mars; and here\r\nagain we resume, though in a somewhat modified form, the methods that\r\nwere appropriate to Venus and to Mercury.\r\n\r\nVenus and Mars have, from one point of view, quite peculiar claims on\r\nour attention. They are our nearest planetary neighbours, on either\r\nside. We may naturally expect to learn more of them than of the other\r\nplanets farther off. In the case of Venus, however, this anticipation\r\ncan hardly be realised, for, as we have already pointed out, its dense\r\natmosphere prevents us from making a satisfactory telescopic\r\nexamination. When we turn to our other planetary neighbour, Mars, we are\r\nenabled to learn a good deal with regard to his appearance. Indeed, with\r\nthe exception of the moon, we are better acquainted with the details of\r\nthe surface of Mars than with those of any other celestial body.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful planet offers many features for consideration besides\r\nthose presented by its physical structure. The orbit of Mars is one of\r\nremarkable proportions, and it was by the observations of this orbit\r\nthat the celebrated laws of Kepler were discovered. During the\r\noccasional approaches of Mars to the earth it has been possible to\r\nmeasure its distance with accuracy, and thus another method of finding\r\nthe sun's distance has arisen which, to say the least, may compete in\r\nprecision with that afforded by the transit of Venus. It must also be\r\nobserved that the greatest achievement in pure telescopic research which\r\nthis century has witnessed was that of the discovery of the satellites\r\nof Mars.\r\n\r\nTo the unaided eye this planet generally appears like a star of the\r\nfirst magnitude. It is usually to be distinguished by its ruddy colour,\r\nbut the beginner in astronomy cannot rely on its colour only for the\r\nidentification of Mars. There are several stars nearly, if not quite, as\r\nruddy as this globe. The bright star Aldebaran, the brightest star in\r\nthe constellation of the Bull, has often been mistaken for the planet.\r\nIt often resembles Betelgeuze, a brilliant point in the constellation of\r\nOrion. Mistakes of this kind will be impossible if the learner has first\r\nstudied the principal constellations and the more brilliant stars. He\r\nwill then find great interest in tracing out the positions of the\r\nplanets, and in watching their ceaseless movements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--The Orbits of the Earth and of Mars, showing\r\nthe Favourable Opposition of 1877.]\r\n\r\nThe position of each orb can always be ascertained from the almanac.\r\nSometimes the planet will be too near the sun to be visible. It will\r\nrise with the sun and set with the sun, and consequently will not be\r\nabove the horizon during the night. The best time for seeing one of the\r\nplanets situated like Mars will be during what is called its opposition.\r\nThis state of things occurs when the earth intervenes directly between\r\nthe planet and the sun. In this case, the distance from Mars to the\r\nearth is less than at any other time. There is also another advantage in\r\nviewing Mars during opposition. The planet is then at one side of the\r\nearth and the sun at the opposite side, so that when Mars is high in the\r\nheavens the sun is directly beneath the earth; in other words, the\r\nplanet is then at its greatest elevation above the horizon at midnight.\r\nSome oppositions of Mars are, however, much more favourable than others.\r\nThis is distinctly shown in Fig. 48, which represents the orbit of Mars\r\nand the orbit of the Earth accurately drawn to scale. It will be seen\r\nthat while the orbit of the earth is very nearly circular, the orbit of\r\nMars has a very decided degree of eccentricity; indeed, with the\r\nexception of the orbit of Mercury, that of Mars has the greatest\r\neccentricity of any orbit of the larger planets in our system.\r\n\r\nThe value of an opposition of Mars for telescopic purposes will vary\r\ngreatly according to circumstances. The favourable oppositions will be\r\nthose which occur as near as possible to the 26th of August. The other\r\nextreme will be found in an opposition which occurs near the 22nd of\r\nFebruary. In the latter case the distance between the planet and the\r\nearth is nearly twice as great as the former. The last opposition which\r\nwas suitable for the highest class of work took place in the year 1877.\r\nMars was then a magnificent object, and received much, and deserved,\r\nattention. The favourable oppositions follow each other at somewhat\r\nirregular intervals; the last occurred in the year 1892, and another\r\nwill take place in the year 1909.\r\n\r\nThe apparent movements of Mars are by no means simple. We can imagine\r\nthe embarrassment of the early astronomer who first undertook the task\r\nof attempting to decipher these movements. The planet is seen to be a\r\nbrilliant and conspicuous object. It attracts the astronomer's\r\nattention; he looks carefully, and he sees how it lies among the\r\nconstellations with which he is familiar. A few nights later he observes\r\nthe same body again; but is it exactly in the same place? He thinks not.\r\nHe notes more carefully than before the place of the planet. He sees how\r\nit is situated with regard to the stars. Again, in a few days, his\r\nobservations are repeated. There is no longer a trace of doubt about the\r\nmatter--Mars has decidedly changed his position. It is veritably a\r\nwanderer.\r\n\r\nNight after night the primitive astronomer is at his post. He notes the\r\nchanges of Mars. He sees that it is now moving even more rapidly than it\r\nwas at first. Is it going to complete the circuit of the heavens? The\r\nastronomer determines to watch the orb and see whether this surmise is\r\njustified. He pursues his task night after night, and at length he\r\nbegins to think that the body is not moving quite so rapidly as at\r\nfirst. A few nights more, and he is sure of the fact: the planet is\r\nmoving more slowly. Again a few nights more, and he begins to surmise\r\nthat the motion may cease; after a short time the motion does cease, and\r\nthe object seems to rest; but is it going to remain at rest for ever?\r\nHas its long journey been finished? For many nights this seems to be the\r\ncase, but at length the astronomer suspects that the planet must be\r\ncommencing to move backwards. A few nights more, and the fact is\r\nconfirmed beyond possibility of doubt, and the extraordinary discovery\r\nof the direct and the retrograde movement of Mars has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--The Apparent Movements of Mars In 1877.]\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of its journey around the heavens Mars seems to move\r\nsteadily from the west to the east. It moves backwards, in fact, as the\r\nmoon moves and as the sun moves. It is only during a comparatively small\r\npart of its path that those elaborate movements are accomplished which\r\npresented such an enigma to the primitive observer. We show in the\r\nadjoining picture (Fig. 49) the track of the actual journey which Mars\r\naccomplished in the opposition of 1877. The figure only shows that part\r\nof its path which presents the anomalous features; the rest of the orbit\r\nis pursued, not indeed with uniform velocity, but with unaltered\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThis complexity of the apparent movements of Mars seems at first sight\r\nfatal to the acceptance of any simple and elementary explanation of the\r\nplanetary motion. If the motion of Mars were purely elliptic, how, it\r\nmay well be said, could it perform this extraordinary evolution? The\r\nelucidation is to be found in the fact that the earth on which we stand\r\nis itself in motion. Even if Mars were at rest, the fact that the earth\r\nmoves would make the planet appear to move. The apparent movements of\r\nMars are thus combined with the real movements. This circumstance will\r\nnot embarrass the geometer. He is able to disentangle the true movement\r\nof the planet from its association with the apparent movement, and to\r\naccount completely for the complicated evolutions exhibited by Mars.\r\nCould we transfer our point of view from the ever-shifting earth to an\r\nimmovable standpoint, we should then see that the shape of the orbit of\r\nMars was an ellipse, described around the sun in conformity with the\r\nlaws which Kepler discovered by observations of this planet.\r\n\r\nMars takes 687 days to travel round the sun, its average distance from\r\nthat body being 141,500,000 miles. Under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances the planet, at the time of opposition, may approach the\r\nearth to a distance not greater than about 35,500,000 miles. No doubt\r\nthis seems an enormous distance, when estimated by any standard adapted\r\nfor terrestrial measurements; it is, however, hardly greater than the\r\ndistance of Venus when nearest, and it is much less than the distance\r\nfrom the earth to the sun.\r\n\r\nWe have explained how the _form_ of the solar system is known from\r\nKepler's laws, and how the absolute size of the system and of its\r\nvarious parts can be known when the direct measurement of any one part\r\nhas been accomplished. A close approach of Mars affords a favourable\r\nopportunity for measuring his distance, and thus, in a different way,\r\nsolving the same problem as that investigated by the transit of Venus.\r\nWe are thus led a second time to a knowledge of the distance of the sun\r\nand the distances of the planets generally, and to many other numerical\r\nfacts about the solar system.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the opposition of Mars in 1877 a successful attempt\r\nwas made to apply this refined process to the solution of the problem of\r\ncelestial measurement. It cannot be said to have been the first occasion\r\non which this method was suggested, or even practically attempted. The\r\nobservations of 1877 were, however, conducted with such skill and with\r\nsuch minute attention to the necessary precautions as to render them an\r\nimportant contribution to astronomy. Dr. David Gill, now her Majesty's\r\nAstronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, undertook a journey to the Island\r\nof Ascension for the purpose of observing the parallax of Mars in 1877.\r\nOn this occasion Mars approached to the earth so closely as to afford an\r\nadmirable opportunity for the application of the method. Dr. Gill\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a valuable series of measurements, and from them\r\nhe concluded the distance of the sun with an accuracy somewhat superior\r\nto that attainable by the transit of Venus.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another method by which Mars can be made to give us\r\ninformation as to the distance of the sun. This method is one of some\r\ndelicacy, and is interesting from its connection with the loftiest\r\nenquiries in mathematical astronomy. It was foreshadowed in the\r\nDynamical theory of Newton, and was wrought to perfection by Le Verrier.\r\nIt is based upon the great law of gravitation, and is intimately\r\nassociated with the splendid discoveries in planetary perturbation which\r\nform so striking a chapter in modern astronomical discovery.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain relation between two quantities which at first sight\r\nseems quite independent. These quantities are the mass of the earth and\r\nthe distance of the sun. The distance of the sun bears to a certain\r\ndistance (which can be calculated when we know the intensity of\r\ngravitation at the earth's surface, the size of the earth and the length\r\nof the year) the same proportion that the cube root of the sun's mass\r\nbears to the cube root of that of the earth. There is no uncertainty\r\nabout this result, and the consequence is obvious. If we have the means\r\nof weighing the earth in comparison with the sun, then the distance of\r\nthe sun can be immediately deduced. How are we to place our great earth\r\nin the weighing scales? This is the problem which Le Verrier has shown\r\nus how to solve, and he does so by invoking the aid of the planet Mars.\r\n\r\nIf Mars in his revolution around the sun were solely swayed by the\r\nattraction of the sun, he would, in accordance with the well-known laws\r\nof planetary motion, follow for ever the same elliptic path. At the end\r\nof one century, or even of many centuries, the shape, the size, and the\r\nposition of that ellipse would remain unaltered. Fortunately for our\r\npresent purpose, a disturbance in the orbit of Mars is produced by the\r\nearth. Although the mass of our globe is so much less than that of the\r\nsun, yet the earth is still large enough to exercise an appreciable\r\nattraction on Mars. The ellipse described by the planet is consequently\r\nnot invariable. The shape of that ellipse and its position gradually\r\nchange, so that the position of the planet depends to some extent upon\r\nthe mass of the earth. The place in which the planet is found can be\r\ndetermined by observation; the place which the planet would have had if\r\nthe earth were absent can be found by calculation. The difference\r\nbetween the two is due to the attraction of the earth, and, when it has\r\nbeen measured, the mass of the earth can be ascertained. The amount of\r\ndisplacement increases from one century to another, but as the rate of\r\ngrowth is small, ancient observations are necessary to enable the\r\nmeasures to be made with accuracy.\r\n\r\nA remarkable occurrence which took place more than two centuries ago\r\nfortunately enables the place of Mars to be determined with great\r\nprecision at that date. On the 1st of October, 1672, three independent\r\nobservers witnessed the occultation of a star in Aquarius by the ruddy\r\nplanet. The place of the star is known with accuracy, and hence we are\r\nprovided with the means of indicating the exact point in the heavens\r\noccupied by Mars on the day in question. From this result, combined with\r\nthe modern meridian observations, we learn that the displacement of Mars\r\nby the attraction of the earth has, in the lapse of two centuries, grown\r\nto about five minutes of arc (294 seconds). It has been maintained that\r\nthis cannot be erroneous to the extent of more than a second, and hence\r\nit would follow that the earth's mass is determined to about one\r\nthree-hundredth part of its amount. If no other error were present, this\r\nwould give the sun's distance to about one nine-hundredth part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Relative Sizes of Mars and the Earth.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the intrinsic beauty of this method, and the very high\r\nauspices under which it has been introduced, it is, we think, at present\r\nhardly worthy of reliance in comparison with some of the other methods.\r\nAs the displacement of Mars, due to the perturbing influence of the\r\nearth, goes on increasing continually, it will ultimately attain\r\nsufficient magnitude to give a very exact value of the earth's mass, and\r\nthen this method will give us the distance of the sun with great\r\nprecision. But interesting and beautiful though this method may be, we\r\nmust as yet rather regard it as a striking confirmation of the law of\r\ngravitation than as affording an accurate means of measuring the sun's\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Drawing of Mars (July 30th, 1894).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Drawing of Mars (August 16th, 1894).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Elevations and Depressions on the \"Terminator\"\r\nof Mars (August 24th, 1894).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--The Southern Polar Cap on Mars (July 1, 1894).]\r\n\r\nThe close approaches of Mars to the earth afford us opportunities for\r\nmaking a careful telescopic scrutiny of his surface. It must not be\r\nexpected that the details on Mars could be inspected with the same\r\nminuteness as those on the moon. Even under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, Mars is still more than a hundred times as far as the\r\nmoon, and, therefore, the features of the planet have to be at least one\r\nhundred times as large if they are to be seen as distinctly as the\r\nfeatures on the moon. Mars is much smaller than the earth. The diameter\r\nof the planet is 4,200 miles, but little more than half that of the\r\nearth. Fig. 50 shows the comparative sizes of the two bodies. We here\r\nreproduce two of the remarkable drawings[16] of Mars made by Professor\r\nWilliam H. Pickering at the Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff A.T. Fig. 51\r\nwas taken on the 30th of July, 1894, and Fig. 52 on the 16th of August,\r\n1894.\r\n\r\nThe southern polar cap on Mars, as seen by Professor William H.\r\nPickering at Lowell Observatory on the 1st of July, 1894, is represented\r\nin Fig. 54.[17] The remarkable black mark intruding into the polar area\r\nwill be noticed. In Fig. 53 are shown a series of unusually marked\r\nelevations and depressions upon the \"terminator\" of the planet, drawn as\r\naccurately as possible to scale by the same skilful hand on the 24th of\r\nAugust, 1894.\r\n\r\nIn making an examination of the planet it is to be observed that it does\r\nnot, like the moon, always present the same face towards the observer.\r\nMars rotates upon an axis in exactly the same manner as the earth. It is\r\nnot a little remarkable that the period required by Mars for the\r\ncompletion of one rotation should be only about half an hour greater\r\nthan the period of rotation of the earth. The exact period is 24 hours,\r\n37 minutes, 22-3/4 seconds. It therefore follows that the aspect of the\r\nplanet changes from hour to hour. The western side gradually sinks from\r\nview, the eastern side gradually assumes prominence. In twelve hours the\r\naspect of the planet is completely changed. These changes, together with\r\nthe inevitable effects of foreshortening, render it often difficult to\r\ncorrelate the objects on the planet with those on the maps. The latter,\r\nit must be confessed, fall short of the maps of the moon in definiteness\r\nand in certainty; yet there is no doubt that the main features of the\r\nplanet are to be regarded as thoroughly established, and some\r\nastronomers have given names to all the prominent objects.\r\n\r\nThe markings on the surface of Mars are of two classes. Some of them are\r\nof an iron-grey hue verging on green, while the others are generally\r\ndark yellow or orange, occasionally verging on white. The former have\r\nusually been supposed to represent the tracts of ocean, the latter the\r\ncontinental masses on the ruddy planet. We possess a great number of\r\ndrawings of Mars, the earliest being taken in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century. Though these early sketches are very rough, and are\r\nnot of much value for the solution of questions of topography, they have\r\nbeen found very useful in aiding us to fix the period of rotation of the\r\nplanet on its axis by comparison with our modern drawings.\r\n\r\nEarly observers had already noticed that each of the poles of Mars is\r\ndistinguished by a white spot. It is, however, to William Herschel that\r\nwe owe the first systematic study of these remarkable polar caps. This\r\nillustrious astronomer was rewarded by a very interesting discovery. He\r\nfound that these arctic tracts on Mars vary both in extent and\r\ndistinctness with the seasons of the hemisphere on which they are\r\nsituated. They attain a maximum development from three to six months\r\nafter the winter solstice on that planet, and then diminish until they\r\nare smallest about three to six months after the summer solstice. The\r\nanalogy with the behaviour of the masses of snow and ice which surround\r\nour own poles is complete, and there has until lately been hardly any\r\ndoubt that the white polar spots of Mars are somewhat similarly\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\nAs the period of revolution of Mars around the sun is so much longer\r\nthan our year, 687 days instead of 365, the seasons of the planet are,\r\nof course, also much longer than the terrestrial seasons. In the\r\nnorthern hemisphere of Mars the summer lasts for no fewer than 381 days,\r\nand the winter must be 306 days. In both hemispheres the white polar cap\r\nin the course of the long winter season increases until it reaches a\r\ndiameter of 45° to 50°, while the long summer reduces it to a small area\r\nonly 4° or 5° in diameter. It is remarkable that one of these white\r\nregions--that at the south pole--seems not to be concentric with the\r\npole, but is placed so much to one side that the south pole of Mars\r\nappears to be quite free from ice or snow once a year.\r\n\r\nAlthough many valuable observations of Mars were made in the course of\r\nthe nineteenth century, it is only since the very favourable opposition\r\nof 1877 that the study of the surface of Mars has made that immense\r\nprogress which is one of the most remarkable features of modern\r\nastronomy. Among the observers who produced valuable drawings of the\r\nplanet in 1877 we may mention Mr. Green, whose exquisite pictures were\r\npublished by the Royal Astronomical Society, and Professor Schiaparelli,\r\nof Milan, who almost revolutionised our knowledge of this planet.\r\nSchiaparelli had a refractor of only eight inches aperture at his\r\ndisposal, but he was doubtless much favoured by the purity of the\r\nItalian sky, which enabled him to detect in the bright portions of the\r\nsurface of Mars a considerable number of long, narrow lines. To these he\r\ngave the name of canals, inasmuch as they issued from the so-called\r\noceans, and could be traced across the reputed continents for\r\nconsiderable distances, which sometimes reached thousands of miles.\r\n\r\nThe canals seemed to form a kind of network, which connected the various\r\nseas with each other. A few of the more conspicuous of these so-called\r\ncanals appeared indeed on some of the drawings made by Dawes and others\r\nbefore Schiaparelli's time. It was, however, the illustrious Italian\r\nastronomer who detected that these narrow lines are present in such\r\ngreat numbers as to form a notable feature of the planet. Some of these\r\nremarkable features are shown in Figs. 51 and 52, which are copied from\r\ndrawings made by Professor William H. Pickering at the Lowell\r\nObservatory in 1894.\r\n\r\nGreat as had been the surprise of astronomers when Schiaparelli first\r\nproclaimed the discovery of these numerous canals, it was, perhaps,\r\nsurpassed by the astonishment with which his announcement was received\r\nin 1882 that most of the canals had become double. Between December,\r\n1881, and February, 1882, thirty of these duplications appear to have\r\ntaken place. Nineteen of these were cases of a well-traced parallel line\r\nbeing formed near a previously existing canal. The remaining canals were\r\nless certainly established, or were cases where the two lines did not\r\nseem to be quite parallel. A copy of the map of Mars which Schiaparelli\r\nformed from his observations of 1881-82 is given in Plate XVIII. It\r\nbrings out clearly these strange double canals, so unlike any features\r\nthat we know on any other globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nSCHIAPARELLI'S MAP OF MARS IN 1881-82.]\r\n\r\nSubsequent observations by Schiaparelli and several other observers\r\nseem to indicate that this phenomenon of the duplication of the canals\r\nis of a periodic character. It is produced about the times when Mars\r\npasses through its equinoxes. One of the two parallel lines is often\r\nsuperposed as exactly as possible upon the track of the old canal. It\r\ndoes, however, sometimes happen that both the lines occupy opposite\r\nsides of the former canal and are situated on entirely new ground. The\r\ndistance between the two lines varies from about 360 miles as a maximum\r\ndown to the smallest limit distinguishable in our large telescopes,\r\nwhich is something less than thirty miles. The breadth of each of these\r\nremarkable channels may range from the limits of visibility, say, up to\r\nmore than sixty miles.\r\n\r\nThe duplication of the canals is perhaps the most difficult problem\r\nwhich Mars offers to us for solution. Even if we admit that the canals\r\nthemselves represent inlets or channels through which the melted polar\r\nsnow makes its way across the equatorial continents, it is not easy to\r\nsee how the duplicate canals can arise. This is especially true in those\r\ncases where the original channel seems to vanish and to be replaced by\r\ntwo quite new canals, each about the breadth of the English Channel, and\r\nlying one on each side of the course of the old one. The very obvious\r\nexplanation that the whole duplication is an optical illusion has been\r\nbrought forward more than once, but never in a conclusive manner. We\r\nmust, perhaps, be content to let the solution of this matter rest for\r\nthe present, in the hope that the extraordinary attention which this\r\nplanet is now receiving will in due time explain the present enigma.\r\n\r\nThe markings on the surface of this planet are, generally speaking, of a\r\npermanent character, so that when we compare drawings made one or two\r\nhundred years ago with drawings made more recently we can recognise in\r\neach the same features. This permanence is, however, not nearly so\r\nabsolute as it is in the case of the moon. In addition to the canals\r\nwhich we have already considered, many other parts of the surface of\r\nMars alter their outlines from time to time. This is particularly the\r\ncase with those dark spots which we call oceans, the contours of which\r\nsometimes undergo modifications in matters of detail which are quite\r\nunmistakable. Changes of colour are often observed on parts of the\r\nplanet, and though some of these observations may perhaps be attributed\r\nto the influence of our own atmosphere on the planet's appearance, they\r\ncannot be all thus accounted for. Some of the phenomena must certainly\r\nbe due to actual changes which have taken place on the surface of Mars.\r\n\r\nAs an example of such changes, we may refer to the north-western part of\r\nthe notable feature, to which Schiaparelli has given the name of _Syrtis\r\nmajor_.[18] This has at various times been recorded as grey, green,\r\nblue, brown, and even violet. When this region (about the time of the\r\nautumnal equinox of the northern hemisphere) is situated in the middle\r\nof the visible disc, the eastern part is distinctly greener than the\r\nwestern. As the season progresses this characteristic colour gets\r\nfeebler, until the green tint is to be perceived only on the shores of\r\nthe Syrtis. The atmosphere of Mars is usually very transparent, and\r\nfortunately allows us to scrutinise the surface of the planet without\r\nputting obstacles in the way m the shape of Martian clouds. Such clouds,\r\nhowever, are not invariably absent. Our view of the surface is\r\noccasionally obstructed in such a manner as to make it certain that\r\nclouds or mist in the atmosphere of Mars must be the cause of the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nWould we form an idea of the physical constitution of the surface of\r\nMars, then the question as to the character of the atmosphere of the\r\nplanet is among the first to be considered. Spectroscopic observations\r\ndo not in this case render us much assistance. Of course, we know that\r\nthe planet has no intrinsic light. It merely shines by reflected\r\nsunlight. The hemisphere which is turned towards the sun is bright, and\r\nthe hemisphere which is turned away from the sun is dark. The spectrum\r\nought, therefore, like that of the moon, to be an exact though faint\r\ncopy of the solar spectrum, unless the sun's rays, by passing twice\r\nthrough the atmosphere of Mars, suffered some absorption which could\r\ngive rise to additional dark lines. Some of the earlier observers\r\nthought that they could distinctly make out some such lines due, as was\r\nsupposed, to water vapour. The presence of such lines is, however,\r\ndenied by Mr. Campbell, of the Lick Observatory, and Professor Keeler,\r\nat the Allegheny Observatory,[19] who, with their unrivalled\r\nopportunities, both instrumental and climatic, could find no difference\r\nbetween the spectra of Mars and the moon. If Mars had an atmosphere of\r\nappreciable extent, its absorptive effect should be noticeable,\r\nespecially at the limb of the planet; but Mr. Campbell's observations do\r\nnot show any increased absorption at the limb. It would therefore seem\r\nthat Mars cannot have an extensive atmosphere, and this conclusion is\r\nconfirmed in several other ways.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness with which we see the surface of this planet tends to\r\nshow that the atmosphere must be very thin as compared with our own.\r\nThere can hardly be any doubt that an observer on Mars with a good\r\ntelescope would be unable to distinguish much of the features of the\r\nearth's surface. This would be the case not only by reason of the strong\r\nabsorption of the light during the double passage through our\r\natmosphere, but also on account of the great diffusion of the light\r\ncaused by this same atmosphere. Also, it is needless to say, the great\r\namount of cloud generally floating over the earth would totally obscure\r\nmany parts of our planet from a Martian observer. But though, as already\r\nmentioned, we occasionally find parts of Mars rendered indistinct, it\r\nmust be acknowledged that the clouds on Mars are very slight. We should\r\nexpect that the polar caps, if composed of snow, would, when melting,\r\nproduce clouds which would more or less hide the polar regions from our\r\ninspection; yet nothing of the kind has ever been seen.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there are very grave doubts as to the existence of\r\nwater on Mars. No doubt we have frequently spoken of the dark markings\r\nas \"oceans\" and of the bright parts as \"continents.\" That this language\r\nwas just has been the opinion of astronomers for a very long time. A few\r\nyears ago Mr. Schaeberle, of the Lick Observatory, came to the very\r\nopposite conclusion. He contended that the dark parts were the\r\ncontinents and the bright ones were the oceans of water, or some other\r\nfluid. He pointed to the irregular shading of the dark parts, which does\r\nnot suggest the idea of light reflected from a spherical surface of\r\nwater, especially as the contrasts between light and shade are strongest\r\nabout the middle of the disc.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noticed that the dark regions are not infrequently\r\ntraversed by still darker streaks, which can be traced for hundreds of\r\nmiles almost in straight lines, while the so-called canals in the bright\r\nparts often seem to be continuations of these same lines. Mr. Schaeberle\r\ntherefore suggests that the canals may be chains of mountains stretching\r\nover sea and land! The late Professor Phillips and Mr. H.D. Taylor have\r\npointed out that if there were lakes or seas in the tropical regions of\r\nMars we should frequently see the sun directly reflected from them, thus\r\nproducing a bright, star-like point which could not escape observation.\r\nEven moderately disturbed water would make its presence known in this\r\nmanner, and yet nothing of the kind has ever been recorded.\r\n\r\nOn the question as to the possibility of life on Mars a few words may be\r\nadded. If we could be certain of the existence of water on Mars, then\r\none of the fundamental conditions would be fulfilled; and even though\r\nthe atmosphere on Mars had but few points of resemblance either in\r\ncomposition or in density to the atmosphere of the earth, life might\r\nstill be possible. Even if we could suppose that a man would find\r\nsuitable nutriment for his body and suitable air for his respiration, it\r\nseems very doubtful whether he would be able to live. Owing to the small\r\nsize of Mars and the smallness of its mass in comparison with the\r\nearth, the intensity of the gravitation on the neighbouring planet would\r\nbe different from the attraction on the surface of the earth. We have\r\nalready alluded to the small gravitation on the moon, and in a lesser\r\ndegree the same remarks will apply to Mars. A body which weighs on the\r\nearth two pounds would on the surface of Mars weigh rather less than one\r\npound. Nearly the same exertion which will raise a 56-lb. weight on the\r\nearth would lift two similar weights on Mars.\r\n\r\nThe earth is attended by one moon. Jupiter is attended by four\r\nconspicuous moons. Mars is a planet revolving between the orbits of the\r\nearth and of Jupiter. It is a body of the same general type as the earth\r\nand Jupiter. It is ruled by the same sun, and all three planets form\r\npart of the same system; but as the earth has one moon and Jupiter four\r\nmoons, why should not Mars also have a moon? No doubt Mars is a small\r\nbody, less even than the earth, and much less than Jupiter. We could not\r\nexpect Mars to have large moons, but why should it be unlike its two\r\nneighbours, and not have any moon at all? So reasoned astronomers, but\r\nuntil modern times no satellite of Mars could be found. For centuries\r\nthe planet has been diligently examined with this special object, and as\r\nfailure after failure came to be recorded, the conclusion seemed almost\r\nto be justified that the chain of analogical reasoning had broken down.\r\nThe moonless Mars was thought to be an exception to the rule that all\r\nthe great planets outside Venus were dignified by an attendant retinue\r\nof satellites. It seemed almost hopeless to begin again a research which\r\nhad often been tried, and had invariably led to disappointment; yet,\r\nfortunately, the present generation has witnessed still one more attack,\r\nconducted with perfect equipment and with consummate skill This attempt\r\nhas obtained the success it so well merited, and the result has been the\r\nmemorable detection of two satellites of Mars.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was made by Professor Asaph Hall, the distinguished\r\nastronomer at the observatory of Washington. Mr. Hall was provided with\r\nan instrument of colossal proportions and of exquisite workmanship,\r\nknown as the great Washington refractor. It is the product of the\r\ncelebrated workshop of Messrs. Alvan Clark and Sons, from which so many\r\nlarge telescopes have proceeded, and in its noble proportions far\r\nsurpassed any other telescope ever devoted to the same research. The\r\nobject-glass measures twenty-six inches in diameter, and is hardly less\r\nremarkable for the perfection of its definition than for its size. But\r\neven the skill of Mr. Hall, and the space-penetrating power of his\r\ntelescope, would not have been able on ordinary occasions to discover\r\nthe satellites of Mars. Advantage was accordingly taken of that\r\nmemorable opposition of Mars in 1877, when, as we have already\r\ndescribed, the planet came unusually near the earth.\r\n\r\nHad Mars been attended by a moon one-hundredth part of the bulk of our\r\nmoon it must long ago have been discovered. Mr. Hall, therefore, knew\r\nthat if there were any satellites they must be extremely small bodies,\r\nand he braced himself for a severe and diligent search. The\r\ncircumstances were all favourable. Not only was Mars as near as it well\r\ncould be to the earth; not only was the great telescope at Washington\r\nthe most powerful refractor then in existence; but the situation of\r\nWashington is such that Mars was seen from the observatory at a high\r\nelevation. It was while the British Association were meeting at\r\nPlymouth, in 1877, that a telegram flashed across the Atlantic.\r\nBrilliant success had rewarded Mr. Hall's efforts. He had hoped to\r\ndiscover one satellite. The discovery of even one would have made the\r\nwhole scientific world ring; but fortune smiled on Mr. Hall. He\r\ndiscovered first one satellite, and then he discovered a second; and, in\r\nconnection with these satellites, he further discovered a unique fact in\r\nthe solar system.\r\n\r\nDeimos, the outer of the satellites, revolves around the planet in the\r\nperiod of 30 hours, 17 mins., 54 secs.; it is the inner satellite,\r\nPhobos, which has commanded the more special attention of every\r\nastronomer in the world. Mars turns round on his axis in a Martial day,\r\nwhich is very nearly the same length as our day of twenty-four hours.\r\nThe inner satellite of Mars moves round in 7 hours, 39 mins., 14 secs.\r\nPhobos, in fact, revolves three times round Mars in the same time that\r\nMars can turn round once. This circumstance is unparalleled in the solar\r\nsystem; indeed, as far as we know, it is unparalleled in the universe.\r\nIn the case of our own planet, the earth rotates twenty-seven times for\r\none revolution of the moon. To some extent the same may be said of\r\nJupiter and of Saturn; while in the great system of the sun himself and\r\nthe planets, the sun rotates on his axis several times for each\r\nrevolution of even the most rapidly moving of the planets. There is no\r\nother known case where the satellite revolves around the primary more\r\nquickly than the primary rotates on its axis. The anomalous movement of\r\nthe satellite of Mars has, however, been accounted for. In a subsequent\r\nchapter we shall again allude to this, as it is connected with an\r\nimportant department of modern astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe satellites are so small that we are unable to measure their\r\ndiameters directly, but from observations of their brightness it is\r\nevident that their diameters cannot exceed twenty or thirty miles, and\r\nmay be even smaller. Owing to their rapid motion the two satellites must\r\npresent some remarkable peculiarities to an observer on Mars. Phobos\r\nrises in the west, passes across the heavens, and sets in the east after\r\nabout five and a half hours, while Deimos rises in the east and remains\r\nmore than two days above the horizon.\r\n\r\nAs the satellites revolve in paths vertically above the equator of their\r\nprimary, the one less than 4,000 miles and the other only some 14,500\r\nmiles above the surface, it follows that they can never be visible from\r\nthe poles of Mars; indeed, to see Phobos, the observer's planetary\r\nlatitude must not be above 68-3/4°. If it were so, the satellite would\r\nbe hidden by the body of Mars, just as we, in the British Islands, would\r\nbe unable to see an object revolving round the earth a few hundred miles\r\nabove the equator.\r\n\r\nBefore passing from the attractive subject of the satellites, we may\r\njust mention two points of a literary character. Mr. Hall consulted his\r\nclassical friends as to the designation to be conferred on the two\r\nsatellites. Homer was referred to, and a passage in the \"Iliad\"\r\nsuggested the names of Deimos and Phobos. These personages were the\r\nattendants of Mars, and the lines in which they occur have been thus\r\nconstrued by my friend Professor Tyrrell:--\r\n\r\n  \"Mars spake, and called Dismay and Rout\r\n  To yoke his steeds, and he did on his harness sheen.\"\r\n\r\nA curious circumstance with respect to the satellites of Mars will be\r\nfamiliar to those who are acquainted with \"Gulliver's Travels.\" The\r\nastronomers on board the flying Island of Laputa had, according to\r\nGulliver, keen vision and good telescopes. The traveller says that they\r\nhad found two satellites to Mars, one of which revolved around him in\r\nten hours, and the other in twenty-one and a half. The author has thus\r\nnot only made a correct guess about the number of the satellites, but he\r\nactually stated the periodic time with considerable accuracy! We do not\r\nknow what can have suggested the latter guess. A few years ago any\r\nastronomer reading the voyage to Laputa would have said this was absurd.\r\nThere might be two satellites to Mars, no doubt; but to say that one of\r\nthem revolves in ten hours would be to assert what no one could believe.\r\nYet the truth has been even stranger than the fiction.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must bring to a close our account of this beautiful and\r\ninteresting planet. There are many additional features over which we are\r\ntempted to linger, but so many other bodies claim our attention in the\r\nsolar system, so many other bodies which exceed Mars in size and\r\nintrinsic importance, that we are obliged to desist. Our next step will\r\nnot, however, at once conduct us to the giant planets. We find outside\r\nMars a host of objects, small indeed, but of much interest; and with\r\nthese we shall find abundant occupation for the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Lesser Members of our System--Bode's Law--The Vacant Region in\r\n     the Planetary System--The Research--The Discovery of Piazzi--Was\r\n     the small Body a Planet?--The Planet becomes Invisible--Gauss\r\n     undertakes the Search by Mathematics--The Planet Recovered--Further\r\n     Discoveries--Number of Minor Planets now known--The Region to be\r\n     Searched--The Construction of the Chart for the Search for Small\r\n     Planets--How a Minor Planet is Discovered--Physical Nature of the\r\n     Minor Planets--Small Gravitation on the Minor Planets--The Berlin\r\n     Computations--How the Minor Planets tell us the Distance of the\r\n     Sun--Accuracy of the Observations--How they may be\r\n     Multiplied--Victoria and Sappho--The most Perfect Method.\r\n\r\nIn our chapters on the Sun and Moon, on the Earth and Venus, and on\r\nMercury and Mars, we have been discussing the features and the movements\r\nof globes of vast dimensions. The least of all these bodies is the moon,\r\nbut even that globe is 2,000 miles from one side to the other. In\r\napproaching the subject of the minor planets we must be prepared to find\r\nobjects of dimensions quite inconsiderable in comparison with the great\r\nspheres of our system. No doubt these minor planets are all of them some\r\nfew miles, and some of them a great many miles, in diameter. Were they\r\nclose to the earth they would be conspicuous, and even splendid,\r\nobjects; but as they are so distant they do not, even in our greatest\r\ntelescopes, become very remarkable, while to the unaided eye they are\r\nalmost all invisible.\r\n\r\nIn the diagram (p. 234) of the orbits of the various planets, it is\r\nshown that a wide space exists between the orbit of Mars and that of\r\nJupiter. It was often surmised that this ample region must be tenanted\r\nby some other planet. The presumption became much stronger when a\r\nremarkable law was discovered which exhibited, with considerable\r\naccuracy, the relative distances of the great planets of our system.\r\nTake the series of numbers, 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, whereof each number\r\n(except the second) is double of the number which precedes it. If we now\r\nadd four to each, we have the series 4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100. With the\r\nexception of the fifth of these numbers (28), they are all sensibly\r\nproportional to the distances of the various planets from the sun. In\r\nfact, the distances are as follows:--Mercury, 3·9; Venus, 7·2; Earth,\r\n10; Mars, 15·2; Jupiter, 52·9; Saturn, 95·4. Although we have no\r\nphysical reason to offer why this law--generally known as Bode's--should\r\nbe true, yet the fact that it is so nearly true in the case of all the\r\nknown planets tempts us to ask whether there may not also be a planet\r\nrevolving around the sun at the distance represented by 28.\r\n\r\nSo strongly was this felt at the end of the eighteenth century that some\r\nenergetic astronomers decided to make a united effort to search for the\r\nunknown planet. It seemed certain that the planet could not be a large\r\none, as otherwise it must have been found long ago. If it should exist,\r\nthen means were required for discriminating between the planet and the\r\nhosts of stars strewn along its path.\r\n\r\nThe search for the small planet was soon rewarded by a success which has\r\nrendered the evening of the first day in the nineteenth century\r\nmemorable in astronomy. It was in the pure skies of Palermo that the\r\nobservatory was situated where the memorable discovery of the first\r\nknown minor planet was made by Piazzi. This laborious and accomplished\r\nastronomer had organised an ingenious system of exploring the heavens\r\nwhich was eminently calculated to discriminate a planet among the starry\r\nhost. On a certain night he would select a series of stars to the number\r\nof fifty, more or less, according to circumstances. With his meridian\r\ncircle he determined the places of the chosen objects. The following\r\nnight, or, at all events, as soon as convenient, he re-observed the\r\nwhole fifty stars with the same instrument and in the same manner, and\r\nthe whole operation was afterwards repeated on two, or perhaps more,\r\nnights. When the observations were compared together he was in\r\npossession of some four or more places of each one of the stars on\r\ndifferent nights, and the whole series was complete. He was persevering\r\nenough to carry on these observations for very many groups, and at\r\nlength he was rewarded by a success which amply compensated him for all\r\nhis toil.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 1st of January, 1801, that Piazzi commenced for the one\r\nhundred and fifty-ninth time to observe a new series. Fifty stars this\r\nnight were viewed in his telescope, and their places were carefully\r\nrecorded. Of these objects the first twelve were undoubtedly stellar,\r\nand so to all appearance was the thirteenth, a star of the eighth\r\nmagnitude in the constellation of Taurus. There was nothing to\r\ndistinguish the telescopic appearance of this object from all the others\r\nwhich preceded or followed it. The following night Piazzi, according to\r\nhis custom, re-observed the whole fifty stars, and he did the same again\r\non the 3rd of January, and once again on the 4th. He then, as usual,\r\nbrought together the four places he had found for each of the several\r\nbodies. When this was done it was at once seen that the thirteenth\r\nobject on the list was quite a different body from the remainder and\r\nfrom all the other stars which he had ever observed before. The four\r\nplaces of this mysterious object were all different; in other words, it\r\nwas in movement, and was therefore a planet.\r\n\r\nA few days' observation sufficed to show how this little body,\r\nafterwards called Ceres, revolved around the sun, and how it circulated\r\nin that vacant path intermediate between the path of Mars and the path\r\nof Jupiter. Great, indeed, was the interest aroused by this discovery\r\nand the influence which it has exercised on the progress of astronomy.\r\nThe majestic planets of our system had now to admit a much more humble\r\nobject to a share of the benefits dispensed by the sun.\r\n\r\nAfter Piazzi had obtained a few further observations, the season for\r\nobserving this part of the heavens passed away, and the new planet of\r\ncourse ceased to be visible. In a few months, no doubt, the same part of\r\nthe sky would again be above the horizon after dark, and the stars would\r\nof course be seen as before. The planet, however, was moving, and would\r\ncontinue to move, and by the time the next season had arrived it would\r\nhave passed off into some distant region, and would be again confounded\r\nwith the stars which it so closely resembled. How, then, was the planet\r\nto be pursued through its period of invisibility and identified when it\r\nagain came within reach of observation?\r\n\r\nThis difficulty attracted the attention of astronomers, and they sought\r\nfor some method by which the place of the planet could be recovered so\r\nas to prevent Piazzi's discovery from falling into oblivion. A young\r\nGerman mathematician, whose name was Gauss, opened his distinguished\r\ncareer by a successful attempt to solve this problem. A planet, as we\r\nhave shown, describes an ellipse around the sun, and the sun lies at a\r\nfocus of that curve. It can be demonstrated that when three positions of\r\na planet are known, then the ellipse in which the planet moves is\r\ncompletely determined. Piazzi had on each occasion measured the place\r\nwhich it then occupied. This information was available to Gauss, and the\r\nproblem which he had to solve may be thus stated. Knowing the place of\r\nthe planet on three nights, it is required, without any further\r\nobservations, to tell what the place of the planet will be on a special\r\noccasion some months in the future. Mathematical calculations, based on\r\nthe laws of Kepler, will enable this problem to be solved, and Gauss\r\nsucceeded in solving it. Gauss demonstrated that though the telescope of\r\nthe astronomer was unable to detect the wanderer during its season of\r\ninvisibility, yet the pen of the mathematician could follow it with\r\nunfailing certainty. When, therefore, the progress of the seasons\r\npermitted the observations to be renewed, the search was recommenced.\r\nThe telescope was directed to the point which Gauss's calculations\r\nindicated, and there was the little Ceres. Ever since its re-discovery,\r\nthe planet has been so completely bound in the toils of mathematical\r\nreasoning that its place every night of the year can be indicated with a\r\nfidelity approaching to that attainable in observing the moon or the\r\ngreat planets of our system.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of one minor planet was quickly followed by similar\r\nsuccesses, so that within seven years Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were added\r\nto the solar system. The orbits of all these bodies lie in the region\r\nbetween the orbit of Mars and of Jupiter, and for many years it seems to\r\nhave been thought that our planetary system was now complete. Forty\r\nyears later systematic research was again commenced. Planet after planet\r\nwas added to the list; gradually the discoveries became a stream of\r\nincreasing volume, until in 1897 the total number reached about 430.\r\nTheir distribution in the solar system is somewhat as represented in\r\nFig. 55. By the improvement of astronomical telescopes, and by the\r\ndevotion with which certain astronomers have applied themselves to this\r\ninteresting research, a special method of observing has been created for\r\nthe distinct purpose of searching out these little objects.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the paths in which all the great planets move through\r\nthe heavens coincide very nearly with the path which the sun appears to\r\nfollow among the stars, and which is known as the ecliptic. It is\r\nnatural to assume that the small planets also move in the same great\r\nhighway, which leads them through all the signs of the zodiac in\r\nsuccession. Some of the small planets, no doubt, deviate rather widely\r\nfrom the track of the sun, but the great majority are approximately near\r\nit. This consideration at once simplifies the search for new planets. A\r\ncertain zone extending around the heavens is to be examined, but there\r\nis in general little advantage in pushing the research into other parts\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to construct a map containing all the stars in this\r\nregion. This is a task of very great labour; the stars visible in the\r\nlarge telescopes are so numerous that many tens of thousands, perhaps we\r\nshould say hundreds of thousands, are included in the region so narrowly\r\nlimited. The fact is that many of the minor planets now known are\r\nobjects of extreme minuteness; they can only be seen with very powerful\r\ntelescopes, and for their detection it is necessary to use charts on\r\nwhich even the faintest stars have been depicted. Many astronomers have\r\nconcurred in the labour of producing these charts; among them may be\r\nmentioned Palisa, of Vienna, who by means of his charts has found\r\neighty-three minor planets, and the late Professor Peters, of Clinton,\r\nNew York, who in a similar way found forty-nine of these bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--The Zone of Minor Planets between Mars and\r\nJupiter.]\r\n\r\nThe astronomer about to seek for a new planet directs his telescope\r\ntowards that part of the sun's path which is on the meridian at\r\nmidnight; there, if anywhere, lies the chance of success, because that\r\nis the region in which such a body is nearer to the earth than at any\r\nother part of its course. He steadfastly compares his chart with the\r\nheavens, and usually finds the stars in the heavens and the stars in the\r\nchart to correspond; but sometimes it will happen that a point in the\r\nheavens is missing from the chart. His attention is at once arrested; he\r\nfollows the object with care, and if it moves it is a planet. Still he\r\ncannot be sure that he has really made a discovery; he has found a\r\nplanet, no doubt, but it may be one of the large number already known.\r\nTo clear up this point he must undertake a further, and sometimes a very\r\nlaborious, enquiry; he must search the Berlin Year-Book and other\r\nephemerides of such planets and see whether it is possible for one of\r\nthem to have been in the position on the night in question. If he can\r\nascertain that no previously discovered body could have been there, he\r\nis then entitled to announce to his brother astronomers the discovery of\r\na new member of the solar system. It seems certain that all the more\r\nimportant of the minor planets have been long since discovered. The\r\nrecent additions to the list are generally extremely minute objects,\r\nbeyond the powers of small telescopes.\r\n\r\nSince 1891 the method of searching for minor planets which we have just\r\ndescribed has been almost abandoned in favour of a process greatly\r\nsuperior. It has been found feasible to employ photography for making\r\ncharts of the heavens. A photographic plate is exposed in the telescope\r\nto a certain region of the sky sufficiently long to enable very faint\r\ntelescopic stars to imprint their images. Care has to be taken that the\r\nclock which moves the camera shall keep pace most accurately with the\r\nrotation of the earth, so that fixed stars appear on the plate as sharp\r\npoints. If, on developing the plate, a star is found to have left a\r\ntrail, it is evident that this star must during the time of exposure\r\n(generally some hours) have had an independent motion of its own; in\r\nother words, it must be a planet. For greater security a second picture\r\nis generally taken of the same region after a short interval. If the\r\nplace occupied by the trail on the first plate is now vacant, while on\r\nthe second plate a new trail appears in a line with the first one, there\r\nremains no possible doubt that we have genuine indications of a planet,\r\nand that we have not been led astray by some impurity on the plate or by\r\na few minute stars which happened to lie very closely together. Wolf,\r\nof Heidelberg, and following in his footsteps Charlois, of Nice, have in\r\nthis manner discovered a great number of new minor planets, while they\r\nhave also recovered a good many of those which had been lost sight of\r\nowing to an insufficiency of observations.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August, 1898, Herr G. Witt, of the observatory of Urania\r\nin Berlin, discovered a new asteroid by the photographic method. This\r\nobject was at first regarded merely as forming an addition of no special\r\nimportance to the 432 asteroids whose discovery had preceded it. It\r\nreceived, as usual, a provisional designation in accordance with a\r\nsimple alphabetical device. This temporary label affixed to Witt's\r\nasteroid was \"D Q.\" But the formal naming of the asteroid has now\r\nsuperseded this label. Herr Witt has given to his asteroid the name of\r\n\"Eros.\" This has been duly accepted by astronomers, and thus for all\r\ntime the planet is to be known.\r\n\r\nThe feature which makes the discovery of Eros one of the most remarkable\r\nincidents in recent astronomy is that on those rare occasions when this\r\nasteroid comes nearest to the earth it is closer to the earth than the\r\nplanet Mars can ever be. Closer than the planet Venus can ever be.\r\nCloser than any other known asteroid can ever be. Thus we assign to Eros\r\nthe exceptional position of being our nearest planetary neighbour in the\r\nwhole host of heaven. Under certain circumstances it will have a\r\ndistance from the earth not exceeding one-seventh of the mean distance\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nOf the physical composition of the asteroids and of the character of\r\ntheir surfaces we are entirely ignorant. It may be, for anything we can\r\ntell, that these planets are globes like our earth in miniature,\r\ndiversified by continents and by oceans. If there be life on such\r\nbodies, which are often only a few miles in diameter, that life must be\r\nsomething totally different from anything with which we are familiar.\r\nSetting aside every other difficulty arising from the possible absence\r\nof water and from the great improbability of finding there an atmosphere\r\nof a density and a composition suitable for respiration, gravitation\r\nitself would prohibit organic beings adapted for this earth from\r\nresiding on a minor planet.\r\n\r\nLet us attempt to illustrate this point, and suppose that we take the\r\ncase of a minor planet eight miles in diameter, or, in round numbers,\r\none-thousandth part of the diameter of the earth. If we further suppose\r\nthat the materials of the planet are of the same nature as the\r\nsubstances in the earth, it is easy to prove that the gravity on the\r\nsurface of the planet will be only one-thousandth part of the gravity of\r\nthe earth. It follows that the weight of an object on the earth would be\r\nreduced to the thousandth part if that object were transferred to the\r\nplanet. This would not be disclosed by an ordinary weighing scales,\r\nwhere the weights are to be placed in one pan and the body to be weighed\r\nin the other. Tested in this way, a body would, of course, weigh\r\nprecisely the same anywhere; for if the gravitation of the body is\r\naltered, so is also in equal proportion the gravitation of the\r\ncounterpoising weights. But, weighed with a spring balance, the change\r\nwould be at once evident, and the effort with which a weight could be\r\nraised would be reduced to one-thousandth part. A load of one thousand\r\npounds could be lifted from the surface of the planet by the same effort\r\nwhich would lift one pound on the earth; the effects which this would\r\nproduce are very remarkable.\r\n\r\nIn our description of the moon it was mentioned (p. 103) that we can\r\ncalculate the velocity with which it would be necessary to discharge a\r\nprojectile so that it would never again fall back on the globe from\r\nwhich it was expelled. We applied this reasoning to explain why the moon\r\nhas apparently altogether lost any atmosphere it might have once\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nIf we assume for the sake of illustration that the densities of all\r\nplanets are identical, then the law which expresses the critical\r\nvelocity for each planet can be readily stated. It is, in fact, simply\r\nproportional to the diameter of the globe in question. Thus, for a minor\r\nplanet whose diameter was one-thousandth part of that of the earth, or\r\nabout eight miles, the critical velocity would be the thousandth part of\r\nsix miles a second--that is, about thirty feet per second. This is a low\r\nvelocity compared with ordinary standards. A child easily tosses a ball\r\nup fifteen or sixteen feet high, yet to carry it up this height it must\r\nbe projected with a velocity of thirty feet per second. A child,\r\nstanding upon a planet eight miles in diameter, throws his ball\r\nvertically upwards; up and up the ball will soar to an amazing\r\nelevation. If the original velocity were less than thirty feet per\r\nsecond, the ball would at length cease to move, would begin to turn, and\r\nfall with a gradually accelerating pace, until at length it regained the\r\nsurface with a speed equal to that with which it had been projected. If\r\nthe original velocity had been as much as, or more than, thirty feet per\r\nsecond, then the ball would soar up and up never to return. In a future\r\nchapter it will be necessary to refer again to this subject.\r\n\r\nA few of the minor planets appear in powerful telescopes as discs with\r\nappreciable dimensions, and they have even been measured with the\r\nmicrometer. In this way Professor Barnard, late of the Lick Observatory,\r\ndetermined the following values for the diameters of the four first\r\ndiscovered minor planets:--\r\n\r\n  Ceres       485 miles.\r\n  Pallas      304 miles.\r\n  Juno        118 miles.\r\n  Vesta       243 miles.\r\n\r\nThe value for Juno is, however, very uncertain, and by far the greater\r\nnumber of the minor planets are very much smaller than the figures here\r\ngiven would indicate. It is possible by a certain calculation to form an\r\nestimate of the aggregate mass of all the minor planets, inasmuch as\r\nobservations disclose to us the extent of their united disturbing\r\ninfluences on the motion of Mars. In this manner Le Verrier concluded\r\nthat the collected mass of the small planets must be about equal to\r\none-fourth of the mass of the earth. Harzer, repeating the enquiry in an\r\nimproved manner, deduced a collected mass one-sixth of that of the\r\nearth. There can be no doubt that the total mass of all the minor\r\nplanets at present known is not more than a very small fraction of the\r\namount to which these calculations point. We therefore conclude that\r\nthere must be a vast number of minor planets which have not yet been\r\nrecognised in the observatory. These unknown planets must be extremely\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of this group of bodies differ in remarkable characteristics\r\nfrom those of the larger planets. Some of them are inclined at angles of\r\n30° to the plane of the earth's orbit, the inclinations of the great\r\nplanets being not more than a few degrees. Some of the orbits of the\r\nminor planets are also greatly elongated ellipses, while, of course, the\r\norbits of the large planets do not much depart from the circular form.\r\nThe periods of revolution of these small objects round the sun range\r\nfrom three years to nearly nine years.\r\n\r\nA great increase in the number of minor planets has rewarded the zeal of\r\nthose astronomers who have devoted their labours to this subject. Their\r\nsuccess has entailed a vast amount of labour on the computers of the\r\n\"Berlin Year-Book.\" That useful work occupies in this respect a position\r\nwhich has not been taken by our own \"Nautical Almanac,\" nor by the\r\nsimilar publications of other countries. A skilful band of computers\r\nmake it their duty to provide for the \"Berlin Year-Book\" detailed\r\ninformation as to the movements of the minor planets. As soon as a few\r\ncomplete observations have been obtained, the little object passes into\r\nthe secure grasp of the mathematician; he is able to predict its career\r\nfor years to come, and the announcements with respect to all the known\r\nminor planets are to be found in the annual volumes of the work referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe growth of discovery has been so rapid that the necessary labour for\r\nthe preparation of such predictions is now enormous. It must be\r\nconfessed that many of the minor planets are very faint and otherwise\r\ndevoid of interest, so that astronomers are sometimes tempted to concur\r\nwith the suggestion that a portion of the astronomical labour now\r\ndevoted to the computation of the paths of these bodies might be more\r\nprofitably applied. For this it would be only necessary to cast adrift\r\nall the less interesting members of the host, and allow them to pursue\r\ntheir paths unwatched by the telescope, or by the still more ceaseless\r\ntables of the mathematical computer.\r\n\r\nThe sun, which controls the mighty orbs of our system, does not disdain\r\nto guide, with equal care, the tiny globes which form the minor planets.\r\nAt certain times some of them approach near enough to the earth to merit\r\nthe attention of those astronomers who are specially interested in\r\ndetermining the dimensions of the solar system. The observations are of\r\nsuch a nature that they can be made with considerable precision; they\r\ncan also be multiplied to any extent that may be desired. Some of these\r\nlittle bodies have consequently a great astronomical future, inasmuch as\r\nthey seem destined to indicate the true distance from the earth to the\r\nsun more accurately than Venus or than Mars. The smallest of these\r\nplanets will not answer for this purpose; they can only be seen in\r\npowerful telescopes, and they do not admit of being measured with the\r\nnecessary accuracy. It is also obvious that the planets to be chosen for\r\nobservation must come as near the earth as possible. In favourable\r\ncircumstances, some of the minor planets will approach the earth to a\r\ndistance which is about three-quarters of the distance of the sun. These\r\nvarious conditions limit the number of bodies available for this purpose\r\nto about a dozen, of which one or two will usually be suitably placed\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of the sun's distance this method by the minor\r\nplanets offers unquestionable advantages. The orb itself is a minute\r\nstar-like point in the telescope, and the measures are made from it to\r\nthe stars which are seen near it. A few words will, perhaps, be\r\nnecessary at this place as to the nature of the observations referred\r\nto. When we speak of the measures from the planet to the star, we do not\r\nrefer to what would be perhaps the most ordinary acceptation of the\r\nexpression. We do _not_ mean the actual measurement of the number of\r\nmiles in a straight line between the planet and the star. This element,\r\neven if attainable, could only be the result of a protracted series of\r\nobservations of a nature which will be explained later on when we come\r\nto speak of the distances of the stars. The measures now referred to are\r\nof a more simple character; they are merely to ascertain the apparent\r\ndistance of the objects expressed in angular measure. This angular\r\nmeasurement is of a wholly different character from the linear\r\nmeasurement, and the two methods may, indeed, lead to results that would\r\nat first seem paradoxical.\r\n\r\nWe may take, as an illustration, the case of the group of stars forming\r\nthe Pleiades, and those which form the Great Bear. The latter is a large\r\ngroup, the former is a small one. But why do we think the words large\r\nand small rightly applied here? Each pair of stars of the Great Bear\r\nmakes a large angle with the eye. Each pair of stars in the Pleiades\r\nmakes a small angle, and it is these angles which are the direct object\r\nof astronomical measurement. We speak of the distance of two stars,\r\nmeaning thereby the angle which is bounded by the two lines from the eye\r\nto the two stars. This is what our instruments are able to measure, and\r\nit is to be observed that no reference to linear magnitude is implied.\r\nIndeed, if we are to mention actual dimensions, it is quite possible,\r\nfor anything we can tell, that the Pleiades may form a much larger group\r\nthan the Great Bear, and that the apparent superiority of the latter is\r\nmerely due to its being closer to us. The most accurate of these angular\r\nmeasures are obtained when two stars, or two star-like points, are so\r\nclose together as to enable them to be included in one field of view of\r\nthe telescope. There are special forms of apparatus which enable the\r\nastronomer in this case to give to his observations a precision\r\nunattainable in the measurement of objects less definitely marked, or at\r\na greater apparent distance. The determination of the distance of the\r\nsmall star-like planet from a star is therefore characterised by great\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nBut there is another and, perhaps, a weightier argument in favour of the\r\ndetermination of the scale of the solar system by this process. The real\r\nstrength of the minor planet method rests hardly so much on the\r\nindividual accuracy of the observations, as on the fact that from the\r\nnature of the method a considerable number of repetitions can be\r\nconcentrated on the result. It will, of course, be understood that when\r\nwe speak of the accuracy of an observation, it is not to be presumed\r\nthat it can ever be entirely free from error. Errors always exist, and\r\nthough they may be small, yet if the quantity to be measured is minute,\r\nan error of intrinsic insignificance may amount to an appreciable\r\nfraction of the whole. The one way by which their effect can be subdued\r\nis by taking the mean of a large number of observations. This is the\r\nreal source of the value of the minor planet method. We have not to wait\r\nfor the occurrence of rare events like the transit of Venus. Each year\r\nwill witness the approach of some one or more minor planets sufficiently\r\nclose to the earth to render the method applicable. The varied\r\ncircumstances attending each planet, and the great variety of the\r\nobservations which may be made upon it, will further conduce to\r\neliminate error.\r\n\r\nAs the planet pursues its course through the sky, which is everywhere\r\nstudded over with countless myriads of minute stars, it is evident that\r\nthis body, itself so like a star, will always have some stars in its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. As the movements of the planet are well known,\r\nwe can foretell where it will be on each night that it is to be\r\nobserved. It is thus possible to prearrange with observers in\r\nwidely-different parts of the earth as to the observations to be made on\r\neach particular night.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made, on the suggestion of Dr. Gill, to carry out\r\nthis method on a scale commensurate with its importance. The planets\r\nIris, Victoria, and Sappho happened, in the years 1888 and 1889, to\r\napproach so close to the earth that arrangements were made for\r\nsimultaneous measurements in both the northern and the southern\r\nhemispheres. A scheme was completely drawn up many months before the\r\nobservations were to commence. Each observer who participated in the\r\nwork was thus advised beforehand of the stars which were to be employed\r\neach night. Viewed from any part of the earth, from the Cape of Good\r\nHope or from Great Britain, the positions of the stars remain absolutely\r\nunchanged. Their distance is so stupendous that a change of place on the\r\nearth displaces them to no appreciable extent. But the case is different\r\nwith a minor planet. It is hardly one-millionth part of the distance of\r\nthe stars, and the displacement of the planet when viewed from the Cape\r\nand when viewed from Europe is a measurable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude we are seeking is to be elicited by comparison between the\r\nmeasurements made in the northern hemisphere with those made in the\r\nsouthern. The observations in the two localities must be as nearly\r\nsimultaneous as possible, due allowance being made for the motion of the\r\nplanet in whatever interval may have elapsed. Although every precaution\r\nis taken to eliminate the errors of each observation, yet the fact\r\nremains that we compare the measures made by observers in the northern\r\nhemisphere with those made by different observers, using of course\r\ndifferent instruments, thousands of miles away. But in this respect we\r\nare at no greater disadvantage than in observing the transit of Venus.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, possible to obviate even this objection, and thus to\r\ngive the minor planet method a supremacy over its rival which cannot be\r\ndisputed. The difficulty would be overcome if we could arrange that an\r\nastronomer, after making a set of observations on a fine night in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, should be instantly transferred, instruments and\r\nall, to the southern station, and there repeat the observations. An\r\nequivalent transformation can be effected without any miraculous agency,\r\nand in it we have undoubtedly the most perfect mode of measuring the\r\nsun's distance with which we are acquainted. This method has already\r\nbeen applied with success by Dr. Gill in the case of Juno, and there are\r\nother members of the host of minor planets still more favourably\r\ncircumstanced.\r\n\r\nConsider, for instance, a minor planet, which sometimes approaches to\r\nwithin 70,000,000 miles of the earth. When the opposition is drawing\r\nnear, a skilled observer is to be placed at some suitable station near\r\nthe equator. The instrument he is to use should be that marvellous piece\r\nof mechanical and optical skill known as the heliometer.[20] It can be\r\nused to measure the angular distance between objects too far apart for\r\nthe filar micrometer. The measurements are to be made in the evening as\r\nsoon as the planet has risen high enough to enable it to be seen\r\ndistinctly. The observer and the observatory are then to be transferred\r\nto the other side of the earth. How is this to be done? Say, rather, how\r\nwe could prevent it from being done. Is not the earth rotating on its\r\naxis, so that in the course of a few hours the observatory on the\r\nequator is carried bodily round for thousands of miles? As the morning\r\napproaches the observations are to be repeated. The planet is found to\r\nhave changed its place very considerably with regard to the stars. This\r\nis partly due to its own motion, but it is also largely due to the\r\nparallactic displacement arising from the rotation of the earth, which\r\nmay amount to so much as twenty seconds. The measures on a single night\r\nwith the heliometer should not have a mean error greater than one-fifth\r\nof a second, and we might reasonably expect that observations could be\r\nsecured on about twenty-five nights during the opposition. Four such\r\ngroups might be expected to give the sun's distance without any\r\nuncertainty greater than the thousandth part of the total amount. The\r\nchief difficulty of the process arises from the movement of the planet\r\nduring the interval which divides the evening from the morning\r\nobservations. This drawback can be avoided by diligent and repeated\r\nmeasurements of the place of the planet with respect to the stars among\r\nwhich it passes.\r\n\r\nIn the monumental piece of work which issued in 1897 from the Cape\r\nObservatory, under the direction of Dr. Gill, the final results from the\r\nobservations of Iris, Victoria, and Sappho have been obtained. From this\r\nit appears that the angle which the earth's equatorial radius subtends\r\nat the centre of the sun when at its mean distance has the value\r\n8\"·802. If we employ the best value of the earth's equatorial radius we\r\nobtain 92,870,000 miles as the mean distance of the centre of the sun\r\nfrom the centre of the earth. This is probably the most accurate\r\ndetermination of the scale of the solar system which has yet been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nJUPITER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Great Size of Jupiter--Comparison of his Diameter with that of\r\n     the Earth--Dimensions of the Planet and his Orbit--His\r\n     Rotation--Comparison of his Weight and Bulk with that of the\r\n     Earth--Relative Lightness of Jupiter--How Explained--Jupiter still\r\n     probably in a Heated Condition--The Belts on Jupiter--Spots on his\r\n     Surface--Time of Rotation of different Spots various--Storms on\r\n     Jupiter--Jupiter not Incandescent--The Satellites--Their\r\n     Discovery--Telescopic Appearance--Their Orbits--The Eclipses and\r\n     Occultations--A Satellite in Transit--The Velocity of Light\r\n     Discovered--How is this Velocity to be Measured\r\n     Experimentally?--Determination of the Sun's Distance by the\r\n     Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites--Jupiter's Satellites\r\n     demonstrating the Copernican System.\r\n\r\nIn our exploration of the beautiful series of bodies which form the\r\nsolar system, we have proceeded step by step outwards from the sun. In\r\nthe pursuit of this method we have now come to the splendid planet\r\nJupiter, which wends its majestic way in a path immediately outside\r\nthose orbits of the minor planets which we have just been considering.\r\nGreat, indeed, is the contrast between these tiny globes and the\r\nstupendous globe of Jupiter. Had we adopted a somewhat different method\r\nof treatment--had we, for instance, discussed the various bodies of our\r\nplanetary system in the order of their magnitude--then the minor planets\r\nwould have been the last to be considered, while the leader of the host\r\nwould be Jupiter. To this position Jupiter is entitled without an\r\napproach to rivalry. The next greatest on the list, the beautiful and\r\ninteresting Saturn, comes a long distance behind. Another great descent\r\nin the scale of magnitude has to be made before we reach Uranus and\r\nNeptune, while still another step downwards must be made before we\r\nreach that lesser group of planets which includes our earth. So\r\nconspicuously does Jupiter tower over the rest, that even if Saturn were\r\nto be augmented by all the other globes of our system rolled into one,\r\nthe united mass would still not equal the great globe of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--The Relative Dimensions of Jupiter and the\r\nEarth.]\r\n\r\nThe adjoining picture (Fig. 56) shows the relative dimensions of Jupiter\r\nand the earth, and it conveys to the eye a more vivid impression of the\r\nenormous bulk of Jupiter than we can readily obtain by merely\r\nconsidering the numerical statements by which his bulk is to be\r\naccurately estimated. As, however, it will be necessary to place the\r\nnumerical facts before our readers, we do so at the outset of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nJupiter revolves in an elliptic orbit around the sun in the focus, at a\r\nmean distance of 483,000,000 miles. The path of Jupiter is thus about\r\n5·2 times as great in diameter as the path pursued by the earth. The\r\nshape of Jupiter's orbit departs very appreciably from a circle, the\r\ngreatest distance from the sun being 5·45, while the least distance is\r\nabout 4·95, the earth's distance from the sun being taken as unity. In\r\nthe most favourable circumstances for seeing Jupiter at opposition, it\r\nmust still be about four times as far from the earth as the earth is\r\nfrom the sun. This great globe will also illustrate the law that the\r\nmore distant a planet is, the slower is the velocity with which its\r\norbital motion is accomplished. While the earth passes over eighteen\r\nmiles each second, Jupiter only accomplishes eight miles. Thus for a\r\ntwofold reason the time occupied by an exterior planet in completing a\r\nrevolution is greater than the period of the earth. Not only has the\r\nouter planet to complete a longer course than the earth, but the speed\r\nis less; it thus happens that Jupiter requires 4,332·6 days, or about\r\nfifty days less than twelve years, to make a circuit of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe mean diameter of the great planet is about 87,000 miles. We say the\r\n_mean_ diameter, because there is a conspicuous difference in the case\r\nof Jupiter between his equatorial and his polar diameters. We have\r\nalready seen that there is a similar difference in the case of the\r\nearth, where we find the polar diameter to be shorter than the\r\nequatorial; but the inequality of these two dimensions is very much\r\nlarger in Jupiter than in the earth. The equatorial diameter of Jupiter\r\nis 89,600 miles, while the polar is not more than 84,400 miles. The\r\nellipticity of Jupiter indicated by these figures is sufficiently marked\r\nto be obvious without any refined measures. Around the shortest diameter\r\nthe planet spins with what must be considered an enormous velocity when\r\nwe reflect on the size of the globe. Each rotation is completed in about\r\n9 hrs. 55 mins.\r\n\r\nWe may naturally contrast the period of rotation of Jupiter with the\r\nmuch slower rotation of our earth in twenty-four hours. The difference\r\nbecomes much more striking if we consider the relative speeds at which\r\nan object on the equator of the earth and on that of Jupiter actually\r\nmoves. As the diameter of Jupiter is nearly eleven times that of the\r\nearth, it will follow that the speed of the equator on Jupiter must be\r\nabout twenty-seven times as great as that on the earth. It is no doubt\r\nto this high velocity of rotation that we must ascribe the extraordinary\r\nellipticity of Jupiter; the rapid rotation causes a great centrifugal\r\nforce, and this bulges out the pliant materials of which he seems to be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nJupiter is not, so far as we can see, a solid body. This is an important\r\ncircumstance; and therefore it will be necessary to discuss the matter\r\nat some little length, as we here perceive a wide contrast between this\r\ngreat planet and the other planets which have previously occupied our\r\nattention. From the measurements already given it is easy to calculate\r\nthe bulk or the volume of Jupiter. It will be found that this planet is\r\nabout 1,300 times as large as the earth; in other words, it would take\r\n1,300 globes, each as large as our earth, all rolled into one, to form a\r\nsingle globe as large as Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIf the materials of which Jupiter is composed were of a nature analogous\r\nto the materials of the earth, we might expect that the weight of the\r\nplanet would exceed the weight of the earth in something like the\r\nproportion of their volumes. This is the matter now proposed to be\r\nbrought to trial. Here we may at once be met with the query, as to how\r\nwe are to find the weight of Jupiter. It is not even an easy matter to\r\nweigh the earth on which we stand. How, then, can we weigh a mighty\r\nplanet vastly larger than the earth, and distant from us by some\r\nhundreds of millions of miles? Truly, this is a bold problem. Yet the\r\nintellectual resources of man have proved sufficient to achieve this\r\nfeat of celestial engineering. They are not, it is true, actually able\r\nto make the ponderous weighing scales in which the great planet is to be\r\ncast, but they are able to divert to this purpose certain natural\r\nphenomena which yield the information that is required.\r\n\r\nSuch investigations are based on the principle of universal gravitation.\r\nThe mass of Jupiter attracts other masses in the solar system. The\r\nefficiency of that attraction is more particularly shown on the bodies\r\nwhich are near the planet. In virtue of this attraction certain\r\nmovements are performed by those bodies. We can observe their character\r\nwith our telescopes, we can ascertain their amount, and from our\r\nmeasurements we can calculate the mass of the body by which the\r\nmovements have been produced. This is the sole method which we possess\r\nfor the investigation of the masses of the planets; and though it may\r\nbe difficult in its application--not only from the observations which\r\nare required, but also from the intricacy and the profundity of the\r\ncalculations to which those observations must be submitted--yet, in the\r\ncase of Jupiter at least, there is no uncertainty about the result.\r\n\r\nThe task is peculiarly simplified in the case of the greatest planet of\r\nour system by the beautiful system of moons with which he is attended.\r\nThese little moons revolve under the guidance of Jupiter, and their\r\nmovements are not otherwise interfered with so as to prevent their use\r\nfor our present purpose. It is from the observations of the satellites\r\nof Jupiter that we are enabled to measure his attractive power, and\r\nthence to calculate the mass of the mighty planet.\r\n\r\nTo those not specially conversant with the principles of mechanics, it\r\nmay seem difficult to realise the degree of accuracy of which such a\r\nmethod is capable. Yet there can be no doubt that his moons inform us of\r\nthe mass of Jupiter, and do not leave a margin of inaccuracy so great as\r\none hundredth part of the total amount. If other confirmation be needed,\r\nthen it is forthcoming in abundance. A minor planet occasionally draws\r\nnear the orbit of Jupiter and experiences his attraction; the planet is\r\nforced to swerve from its path, and the amount of the deviation can be\r\nmeasured. From that measurement the mass of Jupiter can be computed by a\r\ncalculation, of which it would be impossible to give an account in this\r\nplace. The mass of Jupiter, as determined by this method, agrees with\r\nthe mass obtained in a totally different manner from the satellites.\r\n\r\nNor have we yet exhausted the resources of astronomy in its bearing on\r\nthis question. We can discard the planetary system, and invite the\r\nassistance of a comet which, flashing through the orbits of the planets,\r\noccasionally experiences large and sometimes enormous disturbances. For\r\nthe present it suffices to remark, that on one or two occasions it has\r\nhappened that venturous comets have been near enough to Jupiter to be\r\nmuch disturbed by his attraction, and then to proclaim in their altered\r\nmovements the magnitude of the mass which has affected them. The\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, the minor planets, and the comets, all tell the\r\nweight of the giant orb; and, as they all concur in the result (at least\r\nwithin extremely narrow limits), we cannot hesitate to conclude that the\r\nmass of the greatest planet of our system has been determined with\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nThe results of these measures must now be stated. They show, of course,\r\nthat Jupiter is vastly inferior to the sun--that, in fact, it would take\r\nabout 1,047 Jupiters, all rolled into one, to form a globe equal in\r\n_weight_ to the sun. They also show us that it would take 316 globes as\r\nheavy as our Earth to counterbalance the weight of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this proves Jupiter to be a body of magnificent proportions;\r\nbut the remarkable circumstance is not that Jupiter should be 316 times\r\nas heavy as the earth, but that he is not a great deal more. Have we not\r\nstated that Jupiter is 1,300 times as _large_ as the earth? How then\r\ncomes it that he is only 316 times as _heavy_? This points at once to\r\nsome fundamental contrast between the constitution of Jupiter and of the\r\nearth. How are we to account for this difference? We can conceive of two\r\nexplanations. In the first place, it might be supposed that Jupiter is\r\nconstituted of materials partly or wholly unknown on the earth. There\r\nis, however, an alternative supposition at once more philosophical and\r\nmore consistent with the evidence. It is true that we know little or\r\nnothing of what the elementary substances on Jupiter may be, but one of\r\nthe great discoveries of modern astronomy has taught us something of the\r\nelementary bodies present in other bodies of the universe, and has\r\ndemonstrated that to a large extent they are identical with the\r\nelementary bodies on the earth. If Jupiter be composed of bodies\r\nresembling those on the earth, there is one way, and only one, in which\r\nwe can account for the disparity between his size and his mass. Perhaps\r\nthe best way of stating the argument will be found in a glance at the\r\nremote history of the earth itself, for it seems not impossible that the\r\npresent condition of Jupiter was itself foreshadowed by the condition of\r\nour earth countless ages ago.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we had occasion to point out how the earth seemed\r\nto be cooling from an earlier and highly heated condition. The further\r\nwe look back, the hotter our globe seems to have been; and if we project\r\nour glance back to an epoch sufficiently remote, we see that it must\r\nonce have been so hot that life on its surface would have been\r\nimpossible. Back still earlier, we find the heat to have been such that\r\nwater could not rest on the earth; and hence it seems likely that at\r\nsome incredibly remote epoch all the oceans now reposing in the deeps on\r\nthe surface, and perhaps a considerable portion of its now solid crust,\r\nmust have been in a state of vapour. Such a transformation of the globe\r\nwould not alter its _mass_, for the materials weigh the same whatever be\r\ntheir condition as to temperature, but it would alter the _size_ of our\r\nglobe to a very considerable extent. If these oceans were transformed\r\ninto vapour, then the atmosphere, charged with mighty clouds, would have\r\na bulk some hundreds of times greater than that which it has at present.\r\nViewed from a distant planet, the cloud-laden atmosphere would indicate\r\nthe visible size of our globe, and its average density would accordingly\r\nappear to be very much less than it is at present.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it will be manifest that the discrepancy\r\nbetween the size and the weight of Jupiter, as contrasted with our\r\nearth, would be completely removed if we supposed that Jupiter was at\r\nthe present day a highly heated body in the condition of our earth\r\ncountless ages ago. Every circumstance of the case tends to justify this\r\nargument. We have assigned the smallness of the moon as a reason why the\r\nmoon has cooled sufficiently to make its volcanoes silent and still. In\r\nthe same way the smallness of the earth, as compared with Jupiter,\r\naccounts for the fact that Jupiter still retains a large part of its\r\noriginal heat, while the smaller earth has dissipated most of its store.\r\nThis argument is illustrated and strengthened when we introduce other\r\nplanets into the comparison. As a general rule we find that the smaller\r\nbodies, like the earth and Mars, have a high density, indicative of a\r\nlow temperature, while the giant planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, have\r\na low density, suggesting that they still retain a large part of their\r\noriginal heat. We say \"original heat\" for the want, perhaps, of a more\r\ncorrect expression; it will, however, indicate that we do not in the\r\nleast refer to the solar heat, of which, indeed, the great outer planets\r\nreceive much less than those nearer the sun. Where the original heat may\r\nhave come from is a matter still confined to the province of\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nA complete justification of these views with regard to Jupiter is to be\r\nfound when we make a minute telescopic scrutiny of its surface; and it\r\nfortunately happens that the size of the planet is so great that, even\r\nat a distance of more millions of miles than there are days in the year,\r\nwe can still trace on its surface some significant features.\r\n\r\nPlate XI. gives a series of four different views of Jupiter. They have\r\nbeen taken from a series of admirable drawings of the great planet made\r\nby Mr. Griffiths in 1897. The first picture shows the appearance of the\r\nglobe at 10h. 20m. Greenwich time on February 17th, 1897, through a\r\npowerful refracting telescope. We at once notice in this drawing that\r\nthe outline of Jupiter is distinctly elliptical. The surface of the\r\nplanet usually shows the remarkable series of belts here represented.\r\nThey are nearly parallel to each other and to the planet's equator.\r\n\r\nWhen Jupiter is observed for some hours, the appearance of the belts\r\nundergoes certain changes. These are partly due to the regular rotation\r\nof the planet on its axis, which, in a period of less than five hours,\r\nwill completely carry away the hemisphere we first saw, and replace it\r\nby the hemisphere originally at the other side. But besides the changes\r\nthus arising, the belts and other features on the planet are also very\r\nvariable. Sometimes new stripes or marks appear, and old ones disappear;\r\nin fact, a thorough examination of Jupiter will demonstrate the\r\nremarkable fact that there are no permanent features whatever to be\r\ndiscerned. We are here immediately struck by the contrast between\r\nJupiter and Mars; on the smaller planet the main topographical outlines\r\nare almost invariable, and it has been feasible to construct maps of the\r\nsurface with tolerably accurate detail; a map of Jupiter is, however, an\r\nimpossibility--the drawing of the planet which we make to-night will be\r\ndifferent from the drawing of the same hemisphere made a few weeks\r\nhence.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be noticed that objects occasionally appear on the\r\nplanet which seem of a rather more persistent character than the belts.\r\nWe may especially mention the object known as the great oblong Red Spot,\r\nwhich has been a very remarkable feature upon the southern hemisphere of\r\nJupiter since 1878. This object, which has attracted a great deal of\r\nattention from observers, is about 30,000 miles long by about 7,000 in\r\nbreadth. Professor Barnard remarks that the older the spots on Jupiter\r\nare, the more ruddy do they tend to become.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is irresistibly forced upon us that when we view the\r\nsurface of Jupiter we are not looking at any solid body. The want of\r\npermanence in the features of the planet would be intelligible if what\r\nwe see be merely an atmosphere laden with clouds of impenetrable\r\ndensity. The belts especially support this view; we are at once reminded\r\nof the equatorial zones on our own earth, and it is not at all unlikely\r\nthat an observer sufficiently remote from the earth to obtain a just\r\nview of its appearance would detect upon its surface more or less\r\nperfect cloud-belts suggestive of those on Jupiter. A view of our earth\r\nwould be, as it were, intermediate between a view of Jupiter and of\r\nMars. In the latter case the appearance of the permanent features of the\r\nplanet is only to a trifling extent obscured by clouds floating over the\r\nsurface. Our earth would always be partly, and often perhaps very\r\nlargely, covered with cloud, while Jupiter seems at all times completely\r\nenveloped.\r\n\r\nFrom another class of observations we are also taught the important\r\ntruth that Jupiter is not, superficially at least, a solid body. The\r\nperiod of rotation of the planet around its axis is derived from the\r\nobservation of certain marks, which present sufficient definiteness and\r\nsufficient permanence to be suitable for the purpose. Suppose one of\r\nthese objects to lie at the centre of the planet's disc; its position is\r\ncarefully measured, and the time is noted. As the hours pass on, the\r\nmark moves to the edge of the disc, then round the other side of the\r\nplanet, and back again to the visible disc. When it has returned to the\r\nposition originally occupied the time is again taken, and the interval\r\nwhich has elapsed is called the period of rotation of the spot.\r\n\r\nIf Jupiter were a solid, and if these features were engraved upon its\r\nsurface, then it is perfectly clear that the time of rotation as found\r\nby any one spot must coincide precisely with the time yielded by any\r\nother spot; but this is not observed to be the case. In fact, it would\r\nbe nearer the truth to say that each spot gives a special period of its\r\nown. Nor are the differences very minute. It has been found that the\r\ntime in which the red spot (the latitude of which is about 25° south) is\r\ncarried round is five minutes longer than that required by some peculiar\r\nwhite marks near the equator. The red spot has now been watched for\r\nabout twenty years, and during most of that time has had a tendency to\r\nrotate more and more slowly, as may be seen from the following values of\r\nits rotation period:--\r\n\r\n  In 1879, 9h. 55m. 33·9s.\r\n  In 1886, 9h. 55m. 40·6s.\r\n  In 1891, 9h. 55m. 41·7s.\r\n\r\nSince 1891 this tendency seems to have ceased, while the spot has been\r\ngradually fading away. Generally speaking, we may say that the\r\nequatorial regions rotate in about 9h. 50m. 20s., and the temperate\r\nzones in about 9h. 55m. 40s. Remarkable exceptions are occasionally met\r\nwith. Some small black spots in north latitude 22°, which broke out in\r\n1880 and again in 1891, rotated in 9h. 48m. to 9h. 49-1/2m. It may,\r\ntherefore, be regarded as certain that the globe of Jupiter, so far as\r\nwe can see it, is not a solid body. It consists, on the exterior at all\r\nevents, of clouds and vaporous masses, which seem to be agitated by\r\nstorms of the utmost intensity, if we are to judge from the ceaseless\r\nchanges of the planet's surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nFeb. 2nd.

Pictures of the planet obtained with the camera in\r\nremarkable circumstances are represented in Figs. 57-60, which were\r\ntaken by Professor Wm. H. Pickering at Arequipa, Peru, on the 12th of\r\nAugust, 1892.[21] The small object with the belts is the planet Jupiter.\r\nThe large advancing disc (of which only a small part can be shown) is\r\nthe moon. The phenomenon illustrated is called the \"occultation\" of the\r\nplanet. The planet is half-way behind the moon in Fig. 59, while in Fig.\r\n60 half of the planet is still hidden by the dark limb of the moon.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the tempests by which the atmosphere surrounding\r\nthe earth is convulsed are to be ultimately attributed to the heat of\r\nthe sun. It is the rays from the great luminary which, striking on the\r\nvast continents, warm the air in contact therewith. This heated air\r\nbecomes lighter, and rises, while air to supply its place must flow in\r\nalong the surface. The currents so produced form a breeze or a wind;\r\nwhile, under exceptional circumstances, we have the phenomena of\r\ncyclones and hurricanes, all originated by the sun's heat. Need we add\r\nthat the rains, which so often accompany the storms, have also arisen\r\nfrom the solar beams, which have distilled from the wide expanse of\r\nocean the moisture by which the earth is refreshed?\r\n\r\nThe storms on Jupiter seem to be vastly greater than those on the earth.\r\nYet the intensity of the sun's heat on Jupiter is only a mere\r\nfraction--less, indeed, than the twenty-fifth part--of that received by\r\nthe earth. It is incredible that the motive power of the appalling\r\ntempests on the great planet can be entirely, or even largely, due to\r\nthe feeble influence of solar heat. We are, therefore, led to seek for\r\nsome other source of such disturbances. What that source is to be will\r\nappear obvious when we admit that Jupiter still retains a large\r\nproportion of primitive internal heat. Just as the sun itself is\r\ndistracted by violent tempests as an accompaniment of its intense\r\ninternal fervour, so, in a lesser degree, do we observe the same\r\nphenomena in Jupiter. It may also be noticed that the spots on the sun\r\nusually lie in more or less regular zones, parallel to its equator, the\r\narrangement being in this respect not dissimilar to that of the belts on\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nIt being admitted that the mighty planet still retains some of its\r\ninternal heat, the question remains as to how much. It is, of course,\r\nobvious that the heat of the planet is inconsiderable when compared\r\nwith the heat of the sun. The brilliance of Jupiter, which makes it an\r\nobject of such splendour in our midnight sky, is derived from the same\r\ngreat source which illuminates the earth, the moon, or the other\r\nplanets. Jupiter, in fact, shines by reflected sunlight, and not in\r\nvirtue of any intrinsic light in his globe. A beautiful proof of this\r\ntruth is familiar to every user of a telescope. The little satellites of\r\nthe planet sometimes intrude between him and the sun, and cast a shadow\r\non Jupiter. The shadow is black, or, at all events, it seems black,\r\nrelatively to the brilliant surrounding surface of the planet. It must,\r\ntherefore, be obvious that Jupiter is indebted to the sun for its\r\nbrilliancy. The satellites supply another interesting proof of this\r\ntruth. One of these bodies sometimes enters the shadow of Jupiter and\r\nlo! the little body vanishes. It does so because Jupiter has cut off the\r\nsupply of sunlight which previously rendered the satellite visible. But\r\nthe planet is not himself able to offer the satellite any light in\r\ncompensation for the sunlight which he has intercepted.[22]\r\n\r\nEnough, however, has been demonstrated to enable us to pronounce on the\r\nquestion as to whether the globe of Jupiter can be inhabited by living\r\ncreatures resembling those on this earth. Obviously this cannot be so.\r\nThe internal heat and the fearful tempests seem to preclude the\r\npossibility of organic life on the great planet, even were there not\r\nother arguments tending to the same conclusion. It may, however, be\r\ncontended, with perhaps some plausibility, that Jupiter has in the\r\ndistant future the prospect of a glorious career as the residence of\r\norganic life. The time will assuredly come when the internal heat must\r\ndecline, when the clouds will gradually condense into oceans. On the\r\nsurface dry land may then appear, and Jupiter be rendered habitable.\r\n\r\nFrom this sketch of the planet itself we now turn to the interesting and\r\nbeautiful system of five satellites by which Jupiter is attended. We\r\nhave, indeed, already found it necessary to allude more than once to\r\nthese little bodies, but not to such an extent as to interfere with the\r\nmore formal treatment which they are now to receive.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the four chief satellites may be regarded as an\r\nimportant epoch in the history of astronomy. They are objects situated\r\nin a remarkable manner on the border-line which divides the objects\r\nvisible to the unaided eye from those which require telescopic aid. It\r\nhas been frequently asserted that these objects have been seen with the\r\nunaided eye; but without entering into any controversy on the matter, it\r\nis sufficient to recite the well-known fact that, although Jupiter had\r\nbeen a familiar object for countless centuries, yet the sharpest eyes\r\nunder the clearest skies never discovered the satellites until Galileo\r\nturned the newly invented telescope upon them. This tube was no doubt a\r\nvery feeble instrument, but very little power suffices to show objects\r\nso dose to the limit of visibility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Jupiter and his Four Satellites as seen in a\r\nTelescope of Low Power.]\r\n\r\nThe view of the planet and its elaborate system of satellites as shown\r\nin a telescope of moderate power, is represented in Fig. 61. We here see\r\nthe great globe, and nearly in a line parsing through its centre lie\r\nfour small objects, three on one side and one on the other. These little\r\nbodies resemble stars, but they can be distinguished therefrom by their\r\nceaseless movements around the planet, which they never fail to\r\naccompany during his entire circuit of the heavens. There is no more\r\npleasing spectacle for the student than to follow with his telescope the\r\nmovements of this beautiful system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Disappearances of Jupiter's Satellites.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 62 we have represented some of the various phenomena which the\r\nsatellites present. The long black shadow is that produced by the\r\ninterposition of Jupiter in the path of the sun's rays. In consequence\r\nof the great distance of the sun this shadow will extend, in the form of\r\na very elongated cone, to a distance far beyond the orbit of the outer\r\nsatellite. The second satellite is immersed in this shadow, and\r\nconsequently eclipsed. The eclipse of a satellite must not be attributed\r\nto the intervention of the body of Jupiter between the satellite and the\r\nearth. Such an occurrence is called an occultation, and the third\r\nsatellite is shown in this condition. The second and the third\r\nsatellites are thus alike invisible, but the cause of the invisibility\r\nis quite different in the two cases. The eclipse is much the more\r\nstriking phenomenon of the two, because the satellite, at the moment it\r\nplunges into the darkness, may be still at some apparent distance from\r\nthe edge of the planet, and is thus seen up to the moment of the\r\neclipse. In an occultation the satellite in passing behind the planet\r\nis, at the time of disappearance, close to the planet's bright edge,\r\nand the extinction of the light from the small body cannot be observed\r\nwith the same impressiveness as the occurrence of an eclipse.\r\n\r\nA satellite also assumes another remarkable situation when in the course\r\nof transit over the face of the planet. The satellite itself is not\r\nalways very easy to see in such circumstances, but the beautiful shadow\r\nwhich it casts forms a sharp black spot on the brilliant orb: the\r\nsatellite will, indeed, frequently cast a visible shadow when it passes\r\nbetween the planet and the sun, even though it be not actually at the\r\nmoment in front of the planet, as it is seen from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe periods in which the four principal moons of Jupiter revolve around\r\ntheir primary are respectively, 1 day 18 hrs. 27 min. 34 secs. for the\r\nfirst; 3 days 13 hrs. 13 min. 42 secs., for the second; 7 days 3 hrs. 42\r\nmin. 33 secs, for the third; and 16 days 16 hrs. 32 min. 11 secs. for\r\nthe fourth. We thus observe that the periods of Jupiter's satellites are\r\ndecidedly briefer than that of our moon. Even the satellite most distant\r\nfrom the great planet requires for each revolution less than two-thirds\r\nof an ordinary lunar month. The innermost of these bodies, revolving as\r\nit does in less than two days, presents a striking series of ceaseless\r\nand rapid changes, and it becomes eclipsed during every revolution. The\r\ndistance from the centre of Jupiter to the orbit of the innermost of\r\nthese four attendants is a quarter of a million miles, while the radius\r\nof the outermost is a little more than a million miles. The second of\r\nthe satellites proceeding outwards from the planet is almost the same\r\nsize as our moon; the other three bodies are larger; the third being the\r\ngreatest of all (about 3,560 miles in diameter). Owing to the minuteness\r\nof the satellites as seen from the earth, it is extremely difficult to\r\nperceive any markings on their surfaces, but the few observations made\r\nseem to indicate that the satellites (like our moon) always turn the\r\nsame face towards their primary. Professor Barnard has, with the great\r\nLick refractor, seen a white equatorial belt on the first satellite,\r\nwhile its poles were very dark. Mr. Douglass, observing with Mr.\r\nLowell's great refractor, has also reported certain streaky markings on\r\nthe third satellite.\r\n\r\nA very interesting astronomical discovery was that made by Professor\r\nE.E. Barnard in 1892. He detected with the 36-inch Lick refractor an\r\nextremely minute fifth satellite to Jupiter at a distance of 112,400\r\nmiles, and revolving in a period of 11 hrs. 57 min. 22·6 secs. It can\r\nonly be seen with the most powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nThe eclipses of Jupiter's satellites had been observed for many years,\r\nand the times of their occurrence had been recorded. At length it was\r\nperceived that a certain order reigned among the eclipses of these\r\nbodies, as among all other astronomical phenomena. When once the laws\r\naccording to which the eclipses recurred had been perceived, the usual\r\nconsequence followed. It became possible to foretell the time at which\r\nthe eclipses would occur in future. Predictions were accordingly made,\r\nand it was found that they were approximately verified. Further\r\nimprovements in the calculations were then perfected, and it was sought\r\nto predict the times with still greater accuracy. But when it came to\r\nnaming the actual minute at which the eclipse should occur, expectations\r\nwere not always realised. Sometimes the eclipse was five or ten minutes\r\ntoo soon. Sometimes it was five or ten minutes too late. Discrepancies\r\nof this kind always demand attention. It is, indeed, by the right use of\r\nthem that discoveries are often made, and one of the most interesting\r\nexamples is that now before us.\r\n\r\nThe irregularity in the occurrence of the eclipses was at length\r\nperceived to observe certain rules. It was noticed that when the earth\r\nwas near to Jupiter the eclipse generally occurred before the predicted\r\ntime; while when the earth happened to be at the side of its orbit away\r\nfrom Jupiter, the eclipse occurred after the predicted time. Once this\r\nwas proved, the great discovery was quickly made by Roemer, a Danish\r\nastronomer, in 1675. When the satellite enters the shadow, its light\r\ngradually decreases until it disappears. It is the last ray of light\r\nfrom the eclipsed satellite that gives the time of the eclipse; but that\r\nray of light has to travel from the satellite to the earth, and enter\r\nour telescope, before we can note the occurrence. It used to be thought\r\nthat light travelled instantaneously, so that the moment the eclipse\r\noccurred was assumed to be the moment when the eclipse was seen in the\r\ntelescope. This was now perceived to be incorrect. It was found that\r\nlight took time to travel. When the earth was comparatively near Jupiter\r\nthe light had only a short journey, the intelligence of the eclipse\r\narrived quickly, and the eclipse was seen sooner than the calculations\r\nindicated. When the earth occupied a position far from Jupiter, the\r\nlight had a longer journey, and took more than the average time, so that\r\nthe eclipse was later than the prediction. This simple explanation\r\nremoved the difficulty attending the predictions of the eclipses of the\r\nsatellites. But the discovery had a significance far more momentous. We\r\nlearned from it that light had a measurable velocity, which, according\r\nto recent researches, amounts to 186,300 miles per second.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated attempts to ascertain the distance of the sun\r\nis derived from a combination of experiments on the velocity of light\r\nwith astronomical measurements. This is a method of considerable\r\nrefinement and interest, and although it does not so fulfil all the\r\nnecessary conditions as to make it perfectly satisfactory, yet it is\r\nimpossible to avoid some reference to it here. Notwithstanding that the\r\nvelocity of light is so stupendous, it has been found possible to\r\nmeasure that velocity by actual trial. This is one of the most delicate\r\nexperimental researches that have ever been undertaken. If it be\r\ndifficult to measure the speed of a rifle bullet, what shall we say of\r\nthe speed of a ray of light, which is nearly a million times as great?\r\nHow shall we devise an apparatus subtle enough to determine the velocity\r\nwhich would girdle the earth at the equator no less than seven times in\r\na single second of time? Ordinary contrivances for measurement are here\r\nfutile; we have to devise an instrument of a wholly different character.\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to discover the speed of a moving body we first mark out\r\na certain distance, and then measure the time which the body requires to\r\ntraverse that distance. We determine the velocity of a railway train by\r\nthe time it takes to pass from one mile-post to the next. We learn the\r\nspeed of a rifle bullet by an ingenious contrivance really founded on\r\nthe same principle. The greater the velocity, the more desirable is it\r\nthat the distance traversed during the experiment shall be as large as\r\npossible. In dealing with the measurement of the velocity of light, we\r\ntherefore choose for our measured distance the greatest length that may\r\nbe convenient. It is, however, necessary that the two ends of the line\r\nshall be visible from each other. A hill a mile or two away will form a\r\nsuitable site for the distant station, and the distance of the selected\r\npoint on the hill from the observer must be carefully measured.\r\n\r\nThe problem is now easily stated. A ray of light is to be sent from the\r\nobserver to the distant station, and the time occupied by that ray in\r\nthe journey is to be measured. We may suppose that the observer, by a\r\nsuitable contrivance, has arranged a lantern from which a thin ray of\r\nlight issues. Let us assume that this travels all the way to the distant\r\nstation, and there falls upon the surface of a reflecting mirror.\r\nInstantly it will be diverted by reflection into a new direction\r\ndepending upon the inclination of the mirror. By suitable adjustment the\r\nlatter can be so placed that the light shall fall perpendicularly upon\r\nit, in which case the ray will of course return along the direction in\r\nwhich it came. Let the mirror be fixed in this position throughout the\r\ncourse of the experiments. It follows that a ray of light starting from\r\nthe lantern will be returned to the lantern after it has made the\r\njourney to the distant station and back again. Imagine, then, a little\r\nshutter placed in front of the lantern. We open the shutter, the ray\r\nstreams forth to the remote reflector, and back again through the\r\nopening. But now, after having allowed the ray to pass through the\r\nshutter, suppose we try and close it before the ray has had time to get\r\nback again. What fingers could be nimble enough to do this? Even if the\r\ndistant station were ten miles away, so that the light had a journey of\r\nten miles in going to the mirror and ten miles in coming back, yet the\r\nwhole course would be accomplished in about the nine-thousandth part of\r\na second--a period so short that even were it a thousand times as long\r\nit would hardly enable manual dexterity to close the aperture. Yet a\r\nshutter can be constructed which shall be sufficiently delicate for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Mode of Measuring the Velocity of Light.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of this beautiful method will be sufficiently obvious from\r\nthe diagram on this page (Fig. 63), which has been taken from Newcomb's\r\n\"Popular Astronomy.\" The figure exhibits the lantern and the observer,\r\nand a large wheel with projecting teeth. Each tooth as it passes round\r\neclipses the beam of light emerging from the lantern, and also the eye,\r\nwhich is of course directed to the mirror at the distant station. In the\r\nposition of the wheel here shown the ray from the lantern will pass to\r\nthe mirror and back so as to be visible to the eye; but if the wheel be\r\nrotating, it may so happen that the beam after leaving the lantern will\r\nnot have time to return before the next tooth of the wheel comes in\r\nfront of the eye and screens it. If the wheel be urged still faster, the\r\nnext tooth may have passed the eye, so that the ray again becomes\r\nvisible. The speed at which the wheel is rotating can be measured. We\r\ncan thus determine the time taken by one of the teeth to pass in front\r\nof the eye; we have accordingly a measure of the time occupied by the\r\nray of light in the double journey, and hence we have a measurement of\r\nthe velocity of light.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that we can tell the velocity of light either by the\r\nobservations of Jupiter's satellites or by experimental enquiry. If we\r\ntake the latter method, then we are entitled to deduce remarkable\r\nastronomical consequences. We can, in fact, employ this method for\r\nsolving that great problem so often referred to--the distance from the\r\nearth to the sun--though it cannot compete in accuracy with some of the\r\nother methods.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the solar system are so considerable that a sunbeam\r\nrequires an appreciable interval of time to span the abyss which\r\nseparates the earth from the sun. Eight minutes is approximately the\r\nduration of the journey, so that at any moment we see the sun as it\r\nappeared eight minutes earlier to an observer in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood. In fact, if the sun were to be suddenly blotted out it\r\nwould still be seen shining brilliantly for eight minutes after it had\r\nreally disappeared. We can determine this period from the eclipses of\r\nJupiter's satellites.\r\n\r\nSo long as the satellite is shining it radiates a stream of light across\r\nthe vast space between Jupiter and the earth. When the eclipse has\r\ncommenced, the little orb is no longer luminous, but there is,\r\nnevertheless, a long stream of light on its way, and until all this has\r\npoured into our telescopes we still see the satellite shining as before.\r\nIf we could calculate the moment when the eclipse really took place, and\r\nif we could observe the moment at which the eclipse is seen, the\r\ndifference between the two gives the time which the light occupies on\r\nthe journey. This can be found with some accuracy; and, as we already\r\nknow the velocity of light, we can ascertain the distance of Jupiter\r\nfrom the earth; and hence deduce the scale of the solar system. It must,\r\nhowever, be remarked that at both extremities of the process there are\r\ncharacteristic sources of uncertainty. The occurrence of the eclipse is\r\nnot an instantaneous phenomenon. The satellite is large enough to\r\nrequire an appreciable time in crossing the boundary which defines the\r\nshadow, so that the observation of an eclipse cannot be sufficiently\r\nprecise to form the basis of an important and accurate measurement.[23]\r\nStill greater difficulties accompany the attempt to define the true\r\nmoment of the occurrence of the eclipse as it would be seen by an\r\nobserver in the vicinity of the satellite. For this we should require a\r\nfar more perfect theory of the movements of Jupiter's satellites than is\r\nat present attainable. This method of finding the sun's distance holds\r\nout no prospect of a result accurate to the one-thousandth part of its\r\namount, and we may discard it, inasmuch as the other methods available\r\nseem to admit of much higher accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe four chief satellites of Jupiter have special interest for the\r\nmathematician, who finds in them a most striking instance of the\r\nuniversality of the law of gravitation. These bodies are, of course,\r\nmainly controlled in their movements by the attraction of the great\r\nplanet; but they also attract each other, and certain curious\r\nconsequences are the result.\r\n\r\nThe mean motion of the first satellite in each day about the centre of\r\nJupiter is 203°·4890. That of the second is 101°·3748, and that of the\r\nthird is 50°·3177. These quantities are so related that the following\r\nlaw will be found to be observed:\r\n\r\nThe mean motion of the first satellite added to twice the mean motion of\r\nthe third is exactly equal to three times the mean motion of the second.\r\n\r\nThere is another law of an analogous character, which is thus expressed\r\n(the mean longitude being the angle between a fixed line and the radius\r\nto the mean place of the satellite): If to the mean longitude of the\r\nfirst satellite we add twice the mean longitude of the third, and\r\nsubtract three times the mean longitude of the second, the difference is\r\nalways 180°.\r\n\r\nIt was from observation that these principles were first discovered.\r\nLaplace, however, showed that if the satellites revolved nearly in this\r\nway, then their mutual perturbations, in accordance with the law of\r\ngravitation, would preserve them in this relative position for ever.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude with the remark, that the discovery of Jupiter's\r\nsatellites afforded the great confirmation of the Copernican theory.\r\nCopernicus had asked the world to believe that our sun was a great\r\nglobe, and that the earth and all the other planets were small bodies\r\nrevolving round the great one. This doctrine, so repugnant to the\r\ntheories previously held, and to the immediate evidence of our senses,\r\ncould only be established by a refined course of reasoning. The\r\ndiscovery of Jupiter's satellites was very opportune. Here we had an\r\nexquisite ocular demonstration of a system, though, of course, on a much\r\nsmaller scale, precisely identical with that which Copernicus had\r\nproposed. The astronomer who had watched Jupiter's moons circling around\r\ntheir primary, who had noticed their eclipses and all the interesting\r\nphenomena attendant on them, saw before his eyes, in a manner wholly\r\nunmistakable, that the great planet controlled these small bodies, and\r\nforced them to revolve around him, and thus exhibited a miniature of the\r\ngreat solar system itself. \"As in the case of the spots on the sun,\r\nGalileo's announcement of this discovery was received with incredulity\r\nby those philosophers of the day who believed that everything in nature\r\nwas described in the writings of Aristotle. One eminent astronomer,\r\nClavius, said that to see the satellites one must have a telescope which\r\nwould produce them; but he changed his mind as soon as he saw them\r\nhimself. Another philosopher, more prudent, refused to put his eye to\r\nthe telescope lest he should see them and be convinced. He died shortly\r\nafterwards.

This gigantic orbit formed\r\nthe boundary to the planetary system, so far as it was known to the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\nAlthough Saturn is not so great a body as Jupiter, yet it vastly exceeds\r\nthe earth in bulk and in mass, and is, indeed, much greater than any one\r\nof the planets, Jupiter alone excepted. But while Saturn must yield the\r\npalm to Jupiter so far as mere dimensions are concerned, yet it will be\r\ngenerally admitted that even Jupiter, with all the retinue by which he\r\nis attended, cannot compete in beauty with the marvellous system of\r\nSaturn. To the present writer it has always seemed that Saturn is one of\r\nthe three most interesting celestial objects visible to observers in\r\nnorthern latitudes. The other two will occupy our attention in future\r\nchapters. They are the great nebula in Orion, and the star cluster in\r\nHercules.\r\n\r\nSo far as the globe of Saturn is concerned, we do not meet with any\r\nfeatures which give to the planet any exceptional interest. The globe is\r\nless than that of Jupiter, and as the latter is also much nearer to us,\r\nthe apparent size of Saturn is in a twofold way much smaller than that\r\nof Jupiter. It should also be noticed that, owing to the greater\r\ndistance of Saturn from the sun, its intrinsic brilliancy is less than\r\nthat of Jupiter. There are, no doubt, certain marks and bands often to\r\nbe seen on Saturn, but they are not nearly so striking nor so\r\ncharacteristic as the ever-variable belts upon Jupiter. The telescopic\r\nappearance of the globe of Saturn must also be ranked as greatly\r\ninferior in interest to that of Mars. The delicacy of detail which we\r\ncan see on Mars when favourably placed has no parallel whatever in the\r\ndim and distant Saturn. Nor has Saturn, regarded again merely as a\r\nglobe, anything like the interest of Venus. The great splendour of Venus\r\nis altogether out of comparison with that of Saturn, while the brilliant\r\ncrescent of the evening star is infinitely more pleasing than any\r\ntelescopic view of the globe of Saturn. Yet even while we admit all this\r\nto the fullest extent, it does not invalidate the claim of Saturn to be\r\none of the most supremely beautiful and interesting objects in the\r\nheavens. This interest is not due to his globe; it is due to that\r\nmarvellous system of rings by which Saturn is surrounded--a system\r\nwonderful from every point of view, and, so far as our knowledge goes,\r\nwithout a parallel in the wide extent of the universe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. Saturn. (July 2nd, 1894. 36-in. equatorial.)\r\n(Prof. E.E. Barnard.)]\r\n\r\nTo the unaided eye Saturn usually appears like a star of the first\r\nmagnitude. Its light alone would hardly be sufficient to discriminate it\r\nfrom many of the brighter fixed stars. Yet the ancients were acquainted\r\nwith Saturn, and they knew it as a planet. It was included with the\r\nother four great planets--Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter--in the\r\ngroup of wanderers, which were bound to no fixed points of the sky like\r\nthe stars. On account of the great distance of Saturn, its movements are\r\nmuch slower than those of the other planets known to the ancients.\r\nTwenty-nine years and a half are required for this distant object to\r\ncomplete its circuit of the heavens; and, though this movement is slow\r\ncompared with the incessant changes of Venus, yet it is rapid enough to\r\nattract the attention of any careful observer. In a single year Saturn\r\nmoves through a distance of about twelve degrees, a quantity\r\nsufficiently large to be conspicuous to casual observation. Even in a\r\nmonth, or sometimes in a week, the planet traverses an arc of the sky\r\nwhich can be detected by anyone who will take the trouble to mark the\r\nplace of the planet with regard to the stars in its vicinity. Those who\r\nare privileged to use accurate astronomical instruments can readily\r\ndetect the motion of Saturn in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe average distance from the sun to Saturn is about 886 millions of\r\nmiles. The path of Saturn, as of every other planet, is really an\r\nellipse with the sun in one focus. In the case of Saturn the shape of\r\nthis ellipse is very appreciably different from a purely circular path.\r\nAround this path Saturn moves with an average velocity of 5·96 miles per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe mean diameter of the globe of Saturn is about 71,000 miles. Its\r\nequatorial diameter is about 75,000 miles, and its polar diameter 67,000\r\nmiles--the ratio of these numbers being approximately that of 10 to 9.\r\nIt is thus obvious that Saturn departs from the truly spherical shape to\r\na very marked extent. The protuberance at its equator must, no doubt, be\r\nattributed to the high velocity with which the planet is rotating. The\r\nvelocity of rotation of Saturn is more than double as fast as that of\r\nthe earth, though it is not quite so fast as that of Jupiter. Saturn\r\nmakes one complete rotation in about 10 hrs. 14 min. Mr. Stanley\r\nWilliams has, however, observed with great care a number of spots which\r\nhe has discovered, and he finds that some of these spots in about 27°\r\nnorth latitude indicate rotation in a period of 10 hrs. 14 mins. to 15\r\nmin., while equatorial spots require no more than 10 hrs. 12 min. to 13\r\nmin. There is, however, the peculiarity that spots in the same latitude,\r\nbut at different parts of the planet, rotate at rates which differ by a\r\nminute or more, while the period found by various groups of spots seems\r\nto change from year to year.\r\n\r\nThese facts prove that Saturn and the spots do not form a rigid system.\r\nThe lightness of this planet is such as to be wholly incompatible with\r\nthe supposition that its globe is constituted of solid materials at all\r\ncomparable with those of which the crust of our earth is composed. The\r\nsatellites, which surround Saturn and form a system only less\r\ninteresting than the renowned rings themselves, enable us to weigh the\r\nplanet in comparison with the sun, and hence to deduce its actual mass\r\nrelatively to the earth. The result is not a little remarkable. It\r\nappears that the density of the earth is eight times as great as that of\r\nSaturn. In fact, the density of the latter is less than that of water\r\nitself, so that a mighty globe of water, equal in bulk to Saturn, would\r\nactually weigh more. If we could conceive a vast ocean into which a\r\nglobe equal to Saturn in size and weight were cast, the great globe\r\nwould not sink like our earth or like any of the other planets; it would\r\nfloat buoyantly at the surface with one-fourth of its bulk out of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWe thus learn with high probability that what our telescopes show upon\r\nSaturn is not a solid surface, but merely a vast envelope of clouds\r\nsurrounding a heated interior. It is impossible to resist the suggestion\r\nthat this planet, like Jupiter, has still retained its heat because its\r\nmass is so large. We must, however, allude to a circumstance which\r\nperhaps may seem somewhat inconsistent with the view here taken. We have\r\nfound that Jupiter and Saturn are, both of them, much less dense than\r\nthe earth. When we compare the two planets together, it appears that\r\nSaturn is much less dense than Jupiter. In fact, every cubic mile of\r\nJupiter weighs nearly twice as much as each cubic mile of Saturn. This\r\nwould seem to point to the conclusion that Saturn is the more heated of\r\nthe two bodies. Yet, as Jupiter is the larger, it might more reasonably\r\nhave been expected to be hotter than the other planet. We do not attempt\r\nto reconcile this discrepancy; in fact, in our ignorance as to the\r\nmaterial constitution of these bodies, it would be idle to discuss the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nEven if we allow for the lightness of Saturn, as compared bulk for bulk\r\nwith the earth, yet the volume of Saturn is so enormous that the planet\r\nweighs more than ninety-five times as much as the earth. The adjoining\r\nview represents the relative sizes of Saturn and the earth (Fig. 65).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Relative Sizes of Saturn and the Earth.]\r\n\r\nAs the unaided eye discloses none of those marvels by which Saturn is\r\nsurrounded, the interest which attaches to this planet may be said to\r\ncommence from the time when it began to be observed with the telescope.\r\nThe history must be briefly alluded to, for it was only by degrees that\r\nthe real nature of this complicated object was understood. When Galileo\r\ncompleted his little refracting telescope, which, though it only\r\nmagnified thirty times, was yet an enormous addition to the powers of\r\nunaided vision, he made with it his memorable review of the heavens. He\r\nsaw the spots on the sun and the mountains on the moon; he noticed the\r\ncrescent of Venus and the satellites of Jupiter. Stimulated and\r\nencouraged by such brilliant discoveries, he naturally sought to examine\r\nthe other planets, and accordingly directed his telescope to Saturn.\r\nHere, again, Galileo at once made a discovery. He saw that Saturn\r\npresented a visible form like the other planets, but that it differed\r\nfrom any other telescopic object, inasmuch as it appeared to him to be\r\ncomposed of three bodies which always touched each other and always\r\nmaintained the same relative positions. These three bodies were in a\r\nline--the central one was the largest, and the two others were east and\r\nwest of it. There was nothing he had hitherto seen in the heavens which\r\nfilled his mind with such astonishment, and which seemed so wholly\r\ninexplicable.\r\n\r\nIn his endeavours to understand this mysterious object, Galileo\r\ncontinued his observations during the year 1610, and, to his amazement,\r\nhe saw the two lesser bodies gradually become smaller and smaller,\r\nuntil, in the course of the two following years, they had entirely\r\nvanished, and the planet simply appeared with a round disc like Jupiter.\r\nHere, again, was a new source of anxiety to Galileo. He had at that day\r\nto contend against the advocates of the ancient system of astronomy, who\r\nderided his discoveries and refused to accept his theories. He had\r\nannounced his observation of the composite nature of Saturn; he had now\r\nto tell of the gradual decline and the ultimate extinction of these two\r\nauxiliary globes, and he naturally feared that his opponents would seize\r\nthe opportunity of pronouncing that the whole of his observations were\r\nillusory.[25] \"What,\" he remarks, \"is to be said concerning so strange a\r\nmetamorphosis? Are the two lesser stars consumed after the manner of the\r\nsolar spots? Have they vanished and suddenly fled? Has Saturn perhaps,\r\ndevoured his own children? Or were the appearances indeed illusion or\r\nfraud, with which the glasses have so long deceived me, as well as many\r\nothers to whom I have shown them? Now, perhaps, is the time come to\r\nrevive the well-nigh withered hopes of those who, guided by more\r\nprofound contemplations, have discovered the fallacy of the new\r\nobservations, and demonstrated the utter impossibility of their\r\nexistence. I do not know what to say in a case so surprising, so\r\nunlooked for, and so novel. The shortness of the time, the unexpected\r\nnature of the event, the weakness of my understanding, and the fear of\r\nbeing mistaken, have greatly confounded me.\"\r\n\r\nBut Galileo was not mistaken. The objects were really there when he\r\nfirst began to observe, they really did decline, and they really\r\ndisappeared; but this disappearance was only for a time--they again came\r\ninto view. They were then subjected to ceaseless examination, until\r\ngradually their nature became unfolded. With increased telescopic power\r\nit was found that the two bodies which Galileo had described as globes\r\non either side of Saturn were not really spherical--they were rather two\r\nluminous crescents with the concavity of each turned towards the central\r\nglobe. It was also perceived that these objects underwent a remarkable\r\nseries of periodic changes. At the beginning of such a series the planet\r\nwas found with a truly circular disc. The appendages first appeared as\r\ntwo arms extending directly outwards on each side of the planet; then\r\nthese arms gradually opened into two crescents, resembling handles to\r\nthe globe, and attained their maximum width after about seven or eight\r\nyears; then they began to contract, until after the lapse of about the\r\nsame time they vanished again.\r\n\r\nThe true nature of these objects was at length discovered by Huyghens in\r\n1655, nearly half a century after Galileo had first detected their\r\nappearance. He perceived the shadow thrown by the ring upon the globe,\r\nand his explanation of the phenomena was obtained in a very\r\nphilosophical manner. He noticed that the earth, the sun, and the moon\r\nrotated upon their axes, and he therefore regarded it as a general law\r\nthat each one of the bodies in the system rotates about an axis. It is\r\ntrue, observations had not yet been made which actually showed that\r\nSaturn was also rotating; but it would be highly, nay, indeed,\r\ninfinitely, improbable that any planet should be devoid of such\r\nmovement. All the analogies of the system pointed to the conclusion that\r\nthe velocity of rotation would be considerable. One satellite of Saturn\r\nwas already known to revolve in a period of sixteen days, being little\r\nmore than half our month. Huyghens assumed--and it was a most reasonable\r\nassumption--that Saturn in all probability rotated rapidly on its axis.\r\nIt was also to be observed that if these remarkable appendages were\r\nattached by an actual bodily connection to the planet they must rotate\r\nwith Saturn. If, however, the appendages were not actually attached it\r\nwould still be necessary that they should rotate if the analogy of\r\nSaturn to other objects in the system were to be in any degree\r\npreserved. We see satellites near Jupiter which revolve around him. We\r\nsee, nearer home, how the moon revolves around the earth. We see how all\r\nthe planetary system revolves around the sun. All these considerations\r\nwere present to Huyghens when he came to the conclusion that, whether\r\nthe curious appendages were actually attached to the planet or were\r\nphysically free from it, they must still be in rotation.\r\n\r\nProvided with such reasonings, it soon became easy to conjecture the\r\ntrue nature of the Saturnian system. We have seen how the appendages\r\ndeclined to invisibility once every fifteen years, and then gradually\r\nreappeared in the form, at first, of rectilinear arms projecting\r\noutwards from the planet. The progressive development is a slow one, and\r\nfor weeks and months, night after night, the same appearance is\r\npresented with but little change. But all this time both Saturn and the\r\nmysterious objects around him are rotating. Whatever these may be, they\r\npresent the same appearance to the eye, notwithstanding their ceaseless\r\nmotion of rotation.\r\n\r\nWhat must be the shape of an object which satisfies the conditions here\r\nimplied? It will obviously not suffice to regard the projections as two\r\nspokes diverging from the planet. They would change from visibility to\r\ninvisibility in every rotation, and thus there would be ceaseless\r\nalterations of the appearance instead of that slow and gradual change\r\nwhich requires fifteen years for a complete period. There are, indeed,\r\nother considerations which preclude the possibility of the objects being\r\nanything of this character, for they are always of the same length as\r\ncompared with the diameter of the planet. A little reflection will show\r\nthat one supposition--and indeed only one--will meet all the facts of\r\nthe case. If there were a thin symmetrical ring rotating in its own\r\nplane around the equator of Saturn, then the persistence of the object\r\nfrom night to night would be accounted for. This at once removes the\r\ngreater part of the difficulty. For the rest, it was only necessary to\r\nsuppose that the ring was so thin that when turned actually edgewise to\r\nthe earth it became invisible, and then as the illuminated side of the\r\nplane became turned more and more towards the earth the appendages to\r\nthe planet gradually increased. The handle-shaped appearance which the\r\nobject periodically assumed demonstrated that the ring could not be\r\nattached to the globe.\r\n\r\nAt length Huyghens found that he had the clue to the great enigma which\r\nhad perplexed astronomers for the last fifty years. He saw that the ring\r\nwas an object of astonishing interest, unique at that time, as it is,\r\nindeed, unique still. He felt, however, that he had hardly demonstrated\r\nthe matter with all the certainty which it merited, and which he thought\r\nthat by further attention he could secure. Yet he was loath to hazard\r\nthe loss of his discovery by an undue postponement of its announcement,\r\nlest some other astronomer might intervene. How, then, was he to secure\r\nhis priority if the discovery should turn out correct, and at the same\r\ntime be enabled to perfect it at his leisure? He adopted the course,\r\nusual at the time, of making his first announcement in cipher, and\r\naccordingly, on March 5th, 1656, he published a tract, which contained\r\nthe following proposition:--\r\n\r\n  aaaaaaa   ccccc   d     eeeee    g       h\r\n  iiiiiii   llll   mm           nnnnnnnnn\r\n  oooo pp   q rr  s ttttt         uuuuu\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of those curious persons whose successors now devote so\r\nmuch labour to double acrostics may have pondered on this renowned\r\ncryptograph, and even attempted to decipher it. But even if such\r\nattempts were made, we do not learn that they were successful. A few\r\nyears of further study were thus secured to Huyghens. He tested his\r\ntheory in every way that he could devise, and he found it verified in\r\nevery detail. He therefore thought that it was needless for him any\r\nlonger to conceal from the world his great discovery, and accordingly in\r\nthe year 1659--about three years after the appearance of his\r\ncryptograph--he announced the interpretation of it. By restoring the\r\nletters to their original arrangement the discovery was enunciated in\r\nthe following words:--\"_Annulo cingitur_, _tenui_, _plano_, _nusquam\r\ncohærente_, _ad eclipticam inclinato_,\" which may be translated into the\r\nstatement:--\"The planet is surrounded by a slender flat ring everywhere\r\ndistinct from its surface, and inclined to the elliptic.\"\r\n\r\nHuyghens was not content with merely demonstrating how fully this\r\nassumption explained all the observed phenomena. He submitted it to the\r\nfurther and most delicate test which can be applied to any astronomical\r\ntheory. He attempted by its aid to make a prediction the fulfilment of\r\nwhich would necessarily give his theory the seal of certainty. From his\r\ncalculations he saw that the planet would appear circular about July or\r\nAugust in 1671. This anticipation was practically verified, for the ring\r\nwas seen to vanish in May of that year. No doubt, with our modern\r\ncalculations founded on long-continued and accurate observation, we are\r\nnow enabled to make forecasts as to the appearance or the disappearance\r\nof Saturn's ring with far greater accuracy; but, remembering the early\r\nstage in the history of the planet at which the prediction of Huyghens\r\nwas made, we must regard its fulfilment as quite sufficient, and as\r\nconfirming in a satisfactory manner the theory of Saturn and his ring.\r\n\r\nThe ring of Saturn having thus been thoroughly established as a fact in\r\ncelestial architecture, each generation of astronomers has laboured to\r\nfind out more and more of its marvellous features. In the frontispiece\r\n(Plate I.) we have a view of the planet as seen at the Harvard College\r\nObservatory, U.S.A., between July 28th and October 20th, 1872. It has\r\nbeen drawn by the skilful astronomer and artist--Mr. L. Trouvelot--and\r\ngives a faithful and beautiful representation of this unique object.\r\n\r\nFig. 64 is a drawing of the same object taken on July 2nd, 1894, by\r\nProf. E.E. Barnard, at the Lick Observatory.\r\n\r\nThe next great discovery in the Saturnian system after those of Huyghens\r\nshowed that the ring surrounding the planet was marked by a dark\r\nconcentric line, which divided it into two parts--the outer being\r\nnarrower than the inner. This line was first seen by J.D. Cassini, when\r\nSaturn emerged from the rays of the sun in 1675. That this black line\r\nis not merely a black mark on the ring, but that it is actually a\r\nseparation, was rendered very probable by the researches of Maraldi in\r\n1715, followed many years later by those of Sir William Herschel, who,\r\nwith that thoroughness which was a marked characteristic of the man,\r\nmade a minute and scrupulous examination of Saturn. Night after night he\r\nfollowed it for hours with his exquisite instruments, and considerably\r\nadded to our knowledge of the planet and his system.\r\n\r\nHerschel devoted very particular attention to the examination of the\r\nline dividing the ring. He saw that the colour of this line was not to\r\nbe distinguished from the colour of the space intermediate between the\r\nglobe and the ring. He observed it for ten years on the northern face of\r\nthe ring, and during that time it continued to present the same breadth\r\nand colour and sharpness of outline. He was then fortunate enough to\r\nobserve the southern side of the ring. There again could the black line\r\nbe seen, corresponding both in appearance and in position with the dark\r\nline as seen on the northern side. No doubt could remain as to the fact\r\nthat Saturn was girdled by two concentric rings equally thin, the outer\r\nedge of one closely approaching to the inner edge of the other.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is right to add that the only absolutely\r\nindisputable proof of the division between the rings has not yet been\r\nyielded by the telescope. The appearances noted by Herschel would be\r\nconsistent with the view that the black line was merely a part of the\r\nring extending through its thickness, and composed of materials very\r\nmuch less capable of reflecting light than the rest of the ring. It is\r\nstill a matter of doubt how far it is ever possible actually to see\r\nthrough the dark line. There is apparently only one satisfactory method\r\nof accomplishing this. It would only occur in rare circumstances, and it\r\ndoes not seem that the opportunity has as yet arisen. Suppose that in\r\nthe course of its motion through the heavens the path of Saturn happened\r\nto cross directly between the earth and a fixed star. The telescopic\r\nappearance of a star is merely a point of light much smaller than the\r\nglobes and rings of Saturn. If the ring passed in front of the star and\r\nthe black line on the ring came over the star, we should, if the black\r\nline were really an opening, see the star shining through the narrow\r\naperture.\r\n\r\nUp to the present, we believe, there has been no opportunity of\r\nsubmitting the question of the duplex character of the ring to this\r\ncrucial test. Let us hope that as there are now so many telescopes in\r\nuse adequate to deal with the subject, there may, ere long, be\r\nobservations made which will decide the question. It can hardly be\r\nexpected that a very small star would be suitable. No doubt the\r\nsmallness of the star would render the observations more delicate and\r\nprecise if the star were visible; but we must remember that it will be\r\nthrown into contrast with the bright rings of Saturn on each margin so\r\nthat unless the star were of considerable magnitude it would hardly\r\nanswer. It has, however, been recently observed that the globe of the\r\nplanet can be, in some degree, discerned through the dark line; this is\r\npractically a demonstration of the fact that the line is at all events\r\npartly transparent.\r\n\r\nThe outer ring is also divided into two by a line much fainter than that\r\njust described. It requires a good telescope and a fine night, combined\r\nwith a favourable position of the planet, to render this line a\r\nwell-marked object. It is most easily seen at the extremities of the\r\nring most remote from the planet. To the present writer, who has\r\nexamined the planet with the twelve-inch refractor of the South\r\nequatorial at Dunsink Observatory, this outer line appears as broad as\r\nthe well-known line; but it is unquestionably fainter, and has a more\r\nshaded appearance. It certainly does not suggest the appearance of being\r\nactually an opening in the ring, and it is often invisible for a long\r\ntime. It seems rather as if the ring were at this place thinner and less\r\nsubstantial without being actually void of substance.\r\n\r\nOn these points it may be expected that much additional information will\r\nbe acquired when next the ring places itself in such a position that its\r\nplane, if produced, would pass between the earth and the sun. Such\r\noccasions are but rare, and even when they do occur it may happen that\r\nthe planet will not be well placed for observation. The next really\r\ngood opportunity will not be till 1907. In this case the sunlight\r\nilluminates one side of the ring, while it is the other side of the ring\r\nthat is presented towards the earth. Powerful telescopes are necessary\r\nto deal with the planet under such circumstances; but it may be\r\nreasonably hoped that the questions relating to the division of the\r\nring, as well as to many other matters, will then receive some further\r\nelucidation.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, other divisions of the ring, both inner and outer, have\r\nbeen recorded. It may, at all events, be stated that no such divisions\r\ncan be regarded as permanent features. Yet their existence has been so\r\nfrequently enunciated by skilful observers that it is impossible to\r\ndoubt that they have been sometimes seen.\r\n\r\nIt was about 200 years after Huyghens had first explained the true\r\ntheory of Saturn that another very important discovery was effected. It\r\nhad, up to the year 1850, been always supposed that the two rings,\r\ndivided by the well-known black line, comprised the entire ring system\r\nsurrounding the planet. In the year just mentioned, Professor Bond, the\r\ndistinguished astronomer of Cambridge, Mass., startled the astronomical\r\nworld by the announcement of his discovery of a third ring surrounding\r\nSaturn. As so often happens in such cases, the same object was\r\ndiscovered independently by another--an English astronomer named Dawes.\r\nThis third ring lies just inside the inner of the two well-known rings,\r\nand extends to about half the distance towards the body of the planet.\r\nIt seems to be of a totally different character from the two other rings\r\nin so far as they present a comparatively substantial appearance. We\r\nshall, indeed, presently show that they are not solid--not even liquid\r\nbodies--but still, when compared with the third ring, the others were of\r\na substantial character. They can receive and exhibit the deeply-marked\r\nshadow of Saturn, and they can throw a deep and black shadow upon Saturn\r\nthemselves; but the third ring is of a much less compact texture. It has\r\nnot the brilliancy of the others, it is rather of a dusky,\r\nsemi-transparent appearance, and the expression \"crape ring,\" by which\r\nit is often designated, is by no means inappropriate. It is the\r\nfaintness of this crape ring which led to its having been so frequently\r\noverlooked by the earlier observers of Saturn.\r\n\r\nIt has often been noticed that when an astronomical discovery has been\r\nmade with a good telescope, it afterwards becomes possible for the same\r\nobject to be observed with instruments of much inferior power. No doubt,\r\nwhen the observer knows what to look for, he will often be able to see\r\nwhat would not otherwise have attracted his attention. It may be\r\nregarded as an illustration of this principle, that the crape ring of\r\nSaturn has become an object familiar to those who are accustomed to work\r\nwith good telescopes; but it may, nevertheless, be doubted whether the\r\nease and distinctness with which the crape ring is now seen can be\r\nentirely accounted for by this supposition. Indeed, it seems possible\r\nthat the crape ring has, from some cause or other, gradually become more\r\nand more visible. The supposed increased brightness of the crape ring is\r\none of those arguments now made use of to prove that in all probability\r\nthe rings of Saturn are at this moment undergoing gradual\r\ntransformation; but observations of Hadley show that the crape ring was\r\nseen by him in 1720, and it was previously seen by Campani and Picard,\r\nas a faint belt crossing the planet. The partial transparency of the\r\ncrape ring was beautifully illustrated in an observation by Professor\r\nBarnard of the eclipse of Iapetus on November 1st, 1889. The satellite\r\nwas faintly visible in the shadow of the crape ring, while wholly\r\ninvisible in the shadow of the better known rings.\r\n\r\nThe various features of the rings are well shown in the drawing of\r\nTrouvelot already referred to. We here see the inner and the outer ring,\r\nand the line of division between them. We see in the outer ring the\r\nfaint traces of the line by which it is divided, and inside the inner\r\nring we have a view of the curious and semi-transparent crape ring. The\r\nblack shadow of the planet is cast upon the ring, thus proving that the\r\nring, no less than the body of the planet, shines only in virtue of the\r\nsunlight which falls upon it. This shadow presents some anomalous\r\nfeatures, but its curious irregularity may be, to some extent, an\r\noptical illusion.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that any attempt to depict the rings of Saturn\r\nonly represents the salient features of that marvellous system. We are\r\nsituated at such a great distance that all objects not of colossal\r\ndimensions are invisible. We have, indeed, only an outline, which makes\r\nus wish to be able to fill in the details. We long, for instance, to see\r\nthe actual texture of the rings, and to learn of what materials they are\r\nmade; we wish to comprehend the strange and filmy crape ring, so unlike\r\nany other object known to us in the heavens. There is no doubt that much\r\nmay even yet be learned under all the disadvantageous conditions of our\r\nposition; there is still room for the labour of whole generations of\r\nastronomers provided with splendid instruments. We want accurate\r\ndrawings of Saturn under every conceivable aspect in which it may be\r\npresented. We want incessantly repeated measurements, of the most\r\nfastidious accuracy. These measures are to tell us the sizes and the\r\nshapes of the rings; they are to measure with fidelity the position of\r\nthe dark lines and the boundaries of the rings. These measures are to be\r\nprotracted for generations and for centuries; then and then only can\r\nterrestrial astronomers learn whether this elaborate system has really\r\nthe attributes of permanence, or whether it may be undergoing changes.\r\n\r\nWe have been accustomed to find that the law of universal gravitation\r\npervades every part of our system, and to look to gravitation for the\r\nexplanation of many phenomena otherwise inexplicable. We have good\r\nreasons for knowing that in this marvellous Saturnian system the law of\r\ngravitation is paramount. There are satellites revolving around Saturn\r\nas well as a ring; these satellites move, as other satellites do, in\r\nconformity with the laws of Kepler; and, therefore, any theory as to the\r\nnature of Saturn's ring must be formed subject to the condition that it\r\nshall be attracted by the gigantic planet situated in its interior.\r\n\r\nTo a hasty glance nothing might seem easier than to reconcile the\r\nphenomena of the ring with the attraction of the planet. We might\r\nsuppose that the ring stands at rest symmetrically around the planet. At\r\nits centre the planet pulls in the ring equally on all sides, so that\r\nthere is no tendency in it to move in one way rather than another; and,\r\ntherefore, it will stay at rest. This will not do. A ring composed of\r\nmaterials almost infinitely rigid might possibly, under such\r\ncircumstances, be for a moment at rest; but it could not remain\r\npermanently at rest any more than can a needle balanced vertically on\r\nits point. In each case the equilibrium is unstable. If the slightest\r\ncause of disturbance arise, the equilibrium is destroyed, and the ring\r\nwould inevitably fall in upon the planet. Such causes of derangement are\r\nincessantly present, so that unstable equilibrium cannot be an\r\nappropriate explanation of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nEven if this difficulty could be removed, there is still another, which\r\nwould be quite insuperable if the ring be composed of any materials with\r\nwhich we are acquainted. Let us ponder for a moment on the matter, as it\r\nwill lead up naturally to that explanation of the rings of Saturn which\r\nis now most generally accepted.\r\n\r\nImagine that you stood on the planet Saturn, near his equator; over your\r\nhead stretches the ring, which sinks down to the horizon in the east and\r\nin the west. The half-ring above your horizon would then resemble a\r\nmighty arch, with a span of about a hundred thousand miles. Every\r\nparticle of this arch is drawn towards Saturn by gravitation, and if the\r\narch continue to exist, it must do so in obedience to the ordinary\r\nmechanical laws which regulate the railway arches with which we are\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of these arches depends upon the resistance of the\r\nstones forming them to a crushing force. Each stone of an arch is\r\nsubjected to a vast pressure, but stone is a material capable of\r\nresisting such pressure, and the arch remains. The wider the span of the\r\narch the greater is the pressure to which each stone is exposed. At\r\nlength a span is reached which corresponds to a pressure as great as the\r\nstones can safely bear, and accordingly we thus find the limiting span\r\nover which a single arch of masonry can be constructed. Apply these\r\nprinciples to the stupendous arch formed by the ring of Saturn. It can\r\nbe shown that the pressure on the materials of the arch capable of\r\nspanning an abyss of such awful magnitude would be something so enormous\r\nthat no materials we know of would be capable of bearing it. Were the\r\nring formed of the toughest steel that was ever made, the pressure would\r\nbe so great that the metal would be squeezed like a liquid, and the\r\nmighty structure would collapse and fall down on the surface of the\r\nplanet. It is not credible that any materials could exist capable of\r\nsustaining a stress so stupendous. The law of gravitation accordingly\r\nbids us search for a method by which the intensity of this stress can be\r\nmitigated.\r\n\r\nOne method is at hand, and is obviously suggested by analogous phenomena\r\neverywhere in our system. We have spoken of the ring as if it were at\r\nrest; let us now suppose it to be animated by a motion of rotation in\r\nits plane around Saturn as a centre. Instantly we have a force developed\r\nantagonistic to the gravitation of Saturn. This force is the so-called\r\ncentrifugal force. If we imagine the ring to rotate, the centrifugal\r\nforce at all points acts in an opposite direction to the attractive\r\nforce, and hence the enormous stress on the ring can be abated and one\r\ndifficulty can be overcome.\r\n\r\nWe can thus attribute to each ring a rotation which will partly relieve\r\nit from the stress the arch would otherwise have to sustain. But we\r\ncannot admit that the difficulty has been fully removed. Suppose that\r\nthe outer ring revolve at such a rate as shall be appropriate to\r\nneutralise the gravitation on its outer edge, the centrifugal force will\r\nbe less at the interior of the ring, while the gravitation will be\r\ngreater; and hence vast stresses will be set up in the interior parts of\r\nthe outer ring. Suppose the ring to rotate at such a rate as would be\r\nadequate to neutralise the gravitation at its inner margin; then the\r\ncentrifugal force at the outer parts will largely exceed the\r\ngravitation, and there will be a tendency to disruption of the ring\r\noutwards.\r\n\r\nTo obviate this tendency we may assume the outer parts of each ring to\r\nrotate more slowly than the inner parts. This naturally requires that\r\nthe parts of the ring shall be mobile relatively to one another, and\r\nthus we are conducted to the suggestion that perhaps the rings are\r\nreally composed of matter in a fluid state. The suggestion is, at first\r\nsight, a plausible one; each part of each ring would then move with an\r\nappropriate velocity, and the rings would thus exhibit a number of\r\nconcentric circular currents with different velocities. The\r\nmathematician can push this inquiry a little farther, and he can study\r\nhow this fluid would behave under such circumstances. His symbols can\r\npursue the subject into the intricacies which cannot be described in\r\ngeneral language. The mathematician finds that waves would originate in\r\nthe supposed fluid, and that as these waves would lead to disruption of\r\nthe rings, the fluid theory must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nBut we can still make one or two more suppositions. What if it be really\r\ntrue that the ring consist of an incredibly large number of concentric\r\nrings, each animated precisely with the velocity which would be suitable\r\nto the production of a centrifugal force just adequate to neutralise the\r\nattraction? No doubt this meets many of the difficulties: it is also\r\nsuggested by those observations which have shown the presence of several\r\ndark lines on the ring. Here again dynamical considerations must be\r\ninvoked for the reply. Such a system of solid rings is not compatible\r\nwith the laws of dynamics.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, compelled to make one last attempt, and still further\r\nto subdivide the ring. It may seem rather startling to abandon entirely\r\nthe supposition that the ring is in any sense a continuous body, but\r\nthere remains no alternative. Look at it how we will, we seem to be\r\nconducted to the conclusion that the ring is really an enormous shoal of\r\nextremely minute bodies; each of these little bodies pursues an orbit of\r\nits own around the planet, and is, in fact, merely a satellite. These\r\nbodies are so numerous and so close together that they seem to us to be\r\ncontinuous, and they may be very minute--perhaps not larger than the\r\nglobules of water found in an ordinary cloud over the surface of the\r\nearth, which, even at a short distance, seems like a continuous body.\r\n\r\nUntil a few years ago this theory of the constitution of Saturn's rings,\r\nthough unassailable from a mathematical point of view, had never been\r\nconfirmed by observation. The only astronomer who maintained that he had\r\nactually seen the rings rotate was W. Herschel, who watched the motion\r\nof some luminous points on the ring in 1789, at which time the plane of\r\nthe ring happened to pass through the earth. From these observations\r\nHerschel concluded that the ring rotated in ten hours and thirty-two\r\nminutes. But none of the subsequent observers, even though they may have\r\nwatched Saturn with instruments very superior to that used by Herschel,\r\nwere ever able to succeed in verifying his rotation of these appendages\r\nof Saturn. If the ring were composed of a vast number of small bodies,\r\nthen the third law of Kepler will enable us to calculate the time which\r\nthese tiny satellites would require to travel completely round the\r\nplanet. It appears that any satellite situated at the outer edge of the\r\nring would require as long a period as 13 hrs. 46 min., those about the\r\nmiddle would not need more than 10 hrs. 28 min., while those at the\r\ninner edge of the ring would accomplish their rotation in 7 hrs. 28 min.\r\nEven our mightiest telescopes, erected in the purest skies and employed\r\nby the most skilful astronomers, refuse to display this extremely\r\ndelicate phenomenon. It would, indeed, have been a repetition on a grand\r\nscale of the curious behaviour of the inner satellite of Mars, which\r\nrevolves round its primary in a shorter time than the planet itself\r\ntakes to turn round on its own axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Prof. Keeler's Method of Measuring the\r\nRotation of Saturn's Ring.]\r\n\r\nBut what the telescope could not show, the spectroscope has lately\r\ndemonstrated in a most effective and interesting manner. We have\r\nexplained in the chapter on the sun how the motion of a source of light\r\nalong the line of vision, towards or away from the observer, produces a\r\nslight shift in the position of the lines of the spectrum. By the\r\nmeasurement of the displacement of the lines the direction and amount of\r\nthe motion of the source of light may be determined. We illustrated the\r\nmethod by showing how it had actually been used to measure the speed of\r\nrotation of the solar surface. In 1895 Professor Keeler,[26] Director of\r\nthe Allegheny Observatory, succeeded in measuring the rotation of\r\nSaturn's ring in this manner. He placed the slit of his spectroscope\r\nacross the ball, in the direction of the major axis of the elliptic\r\nfigure which the effect of perspective gives the ring as shown by the\r\nparallel lines in Fig. 66 stretching from E to W. His photographic\r\nplate should then show three spectra close together, that of the ball of\r\nSaturn in the middle, separated by dark intervals from the narrower\r\nspectra above and below it of the two handles (or ansæ, as they are\r\ngenerally called) of the ring. In Fig. 67 we have represented the\r\nbehaviour of any one line of the spectrum under various suppositions as\r\nto rotation or non-rotation of Saturn and the ring. At the top (1) we\r\nsee how each line would look if there was no rotatory motion; the three\r\nlines produced by ring, planet, and ring are in a straight line. Of\r\ncourse the spectrum, which is practically a very faint copy of the solar\r\nspectrum, shows the principal dark Fraunhofer lines, so that the reader\r\nmust imagine these for himself, parallel to the one we show in the\r\nfigure. But Saturn and the ring are not standing still, they are\r\nrotating, the eastern part (at E) moving towards us, and the western\r\npart (W) moving away from us.[27] At E the line will therefore be\r\nshifted towards the violet end of the spectrum and at W towards the red,\r\nand as the actual linear velocity is greater the further we get away\r\nfrom the centre of Saturn (assuming ring and planet to rotate together),\r\nthe lines would be turned as in Fig. 67 (2), but the three would remain\r\nin a straight line. If the ring consisted of two independent rings\r\nseparated by Cassini's division and rotating with different velocities,\r\nthe lines would be situated as in Fig. 67 (3), the lines due to the\r\ninner ring being more deflected than those due to the outer ring, owing\r\nto the greater velocity of the inner ring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Prof. Keeler's Method of Measuring the Rotation\r\nof Saturn's Ring.]\r\n\r\nFinally, let us consider the case of the rings, consisting of\r\ninnumerable particles moving round the planet in accordance with\r\nKepler's third law. The actual velocities of these particles would be\r\nper second:--\r\n\r\n  At outer edge of ring                    10·69 miles.\r\n  At middle of ring                        11·68 miles.\r\n  At inner edge of ring                    13·01 miles.\r\n  Rotation speed at surface of planet       6·38 miles.\r\n\r\nThe shifting of the lines of the spectrum should be in accordance with\r\nthese velocities, and it is easy to see that the lines ought to lie as\r\nin the fourth figure. When Professor Keeler came to examine the\r\nphotographed spectra, he found the lines of the three spectra tilted\r\nprecisely in this manner, showing that the outer edge of the ring was\r\ntravelling round the planet with a smaller linear velocity than the\r\ninner one, as it ought to do if the sources of light (or, rather, the\r\nreflectors of sunlight) were independent particles free to move\r\naccording to Kepler's third law, and as it ought not to do if the ring,\r\nor rings, were rigid, in which case the outer edge would have the\r\ngreatest linear speed, as it had to travel through the greatest\r\ndistance. Here, at last, was the proof of the meteoritic composition of\r\nSaturn's ring. Professor Keeler's beautiful discovery has since been\r\nverified by repeated observations at the Allegheny, Lick, Paris, and\r\nPulkova Observatories; the actual velocities resulting from the observed\r\ndisplacements of the lines have been measured and found to agree well\r\n(within the limits of the errors of observation) with the calculated\r\nvelocities, so that this brilliant confirmation of the mathematical\r\ndeductions of Clerk Maxwell is raised beyond the possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of Saturn is so faint that only the strongest lines of the\r\nsolar spectrum can be seen in it, but the atmosphere of the planet seems\r\nto exert a considerable amount of general absorption in the blue and\r\nviolet parts of the spectrum, which is especially strong near the\r\nequatorial belt, while a strong band in the red testifies to the density\r\nof the atmosphere. This band is not seen in the spectrum of the rings,\r\naround which there can therefore be no atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs Saturn's ring is itself unique, we cannot find elsewhere any very\r\npertinent illustration of a structure so remarkable as that now claimed\r\nfor the ring. Yet the solar system does show some analogous phenomena.\r\nThere is, for instance, one on a very grand scale surrounding the sun\r\nhimself. We allude to the multitude of minor planets, all confined\r\nwithin a certain region of the system. Imagine these planets to be\r\nvastly increased in number, and those orbits which are much inclined to\r\nthe rest flattened down and otherwise adjusted, and we should have a\r\nring surrounding the sun, thus producing an arrangement not dissimilar\r\nfrom that now attributed to Saturn.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to linger still longer over this beautiful system, to\r\nspeculate on the appearance which the ring would present to an\r\ninhabitant of Saturn, to conjecture whether it is to be regarded as a\r\npermanent feature of our system in the same way as we attribute\r\npermanence to our moon or to the satellites of Jupiter. Looked at from\r\nevery point of view, the question is full of interest, and it provides\r\noccupation abundant for the labours of every type of astronomer. If he\r\nbe furnished with a good telescope, then has he ample duties to fulfil\r\nin the task of surveying, of sketching, and of measuring. If he be one\r\nof those useful astronomers who devote their energies not to actual\r\ntelescopic work, but to forming calculations based on the observations\r\nof others, then the beautiful system of Saturn provides copious\r\nmaterial. He has to foretell the different phases of the ring, to\r\nannounce to astronomers when each feature can be best seen, and at what\r\nhour each element can be best determined. He has also to predict the\r\ntimes of the movements of Saturn's satellites, and the other phenomena\r\nof a system more elaborate than that of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nLastly, if the astronomer be one of that class--perhaps, from some\r\npoints of view, the highest class of all--who employ the most profound\r\nresearches of the human intellect to unravel the dynamical problems of\r\nastronomy, he, too, finds in Saturn problems which test to the utmost,\r\neven if they do not utterly transcend, the loftiest flights of analysis.\r\nHe discovers in Saturn's ring an object so utterly unlike anything else,\r\nthat new mathematical weapons have to be forged for the encounter. He\r\nfinds in the system so many extraordinary features, and such delicacy of\r\nadjustment, that he is constrained to admit that if he did not actually\r\nsee Saturn's rings before him, he would not have thought that such a\r\nsystem was possible. The mathematician's labours on this wondrous system\r\nare at present only in their infancy. Not alone are the researches of so\r\nabstruse a character as to demand the highest genius for this branch of\r\nscience, but even yet the materials for the inquiry have not been\r\naccumulated. In a discussion of this character, observation must precede\r\ncalculation. The scanty observations hitherto obtained, however they may\r\nillustrate the beauty of the system, are still utterly insufficient to\r\nform the basis of that great mathematical theory of Saturn which must\r\neventually be written.\r\n\r\nBut Saturn possesses an interest for a far more numerous class of\r\npersons than those who are specially devoted to astronomy. It is of\r\ninterest, it must be of interest, to every cultivated person who has the\r\nslightest love for nature. A lover of the picturesque cannot behold\r\nSaturn in a telescope without feelings of the liveliest emotion; while,\r\nif his reading and reflection have previously rendered him aware of the\r\ncolossal magnitude of the object at which he is looking, he will be\r\nconstrained to admit that no more remarkable spectacle is presented in\r\nthe whole of nature.\r\n\r\nWe have pondered so long over the fascinations of Saturn's ring that we\r\ncan only give a very brief account of that system of satellites by which\r\nthe planet is attended. We have already had occasion to allude more than\r\nonce to these bodies; it only remains now to enumerate a few further\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 25th of March, 1655, that the first satellite of Saturn\r\nwas detected by Huyghens, to whose penetration we owe the discovery of\r\nthe true form of the ring. On the evening of the day referred to,\r\nHuyghens was examining Saturn with a telescope constructed with his own\r\nhands, when he observed a small star-like object near the planet. The\r\nnext night he repeated his observations, and it was found that the star\r\nwas accompanying the planet in its progress through the heavens. This\r\nshowed that the little object was really a satellite to Saturn, and\r\nfurther observations revealed the fact that it was revolving around him\r\nin a period of 15 days, 22 hours, 41 minutes. Such was the commencement\r\nof that numerous series of discoveries of satellites which accompany\r\nSaturn. One by one they were detected, so that at the present time no\r\nfewer than nine are known to attend the great planet through his\r\nwanderings. The subsequent discoveries were, however, in no case made by\r\nHuyghens, for he abandoned the search for any further satellites on\r\ngrounds which sound strange to modern ears, but which were quite in\r\nkeeping with the ideas of his time. It appears that from some principle\r\nof symmetry, Huyghens thought that it would accord with the fitness of\r\nthings that the number of satellites, or secondary planets, should be\r\nequal in number to the primary planets themselves. The primary planets,\r\nincluding the earth, numbered six; and Huyghens' discovery now brought\r\nthe total number of satellites to be also six. The earth had one,\r\nJupiter had four, Saturn had one, and the system was complete.\r\n\r\nNature, however, knows no such arithmetical doctrines as those which\r\nHuyghens attributed to her. Had he been less influenced by such\r\nprejudices, he might, perhaps, have anticipated the labours of Cassini,\r\nwho, by discovering other satellites of Saturn, demonstrated the\r\nabsurdity of the doctrine of numerical equality between planets and\r\nsatellites. As further discoveries were made, the number of satellites\r\nwas at first raised above the number of planets; but in recent times,\r\nwhen the swarm of minor planets came to be discovered, the number of\r\nplanets speedily reached and speedily passed the number of their\r\nattendant satellites.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1671, about sixteen years after the discovery of the first\r\nsatellite of Saturn, that a second was discovered by Cassini. This is\r\nthe outermost of the older satellites; it takes 79 days to travel round\r\nSaturn. In the following year he discovered another; and twelve years\r\nlater, in 1684, still two more; thus making a total of five satellites\r\nto this planet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Transit of Titan and its Shadow, by F. Terby\r\nLouvain, 12th April, 1892.]\r\n\r\nThe complexity of the Saturnian system had now no rival in the heavens.\r\nSaturn had five satellites, and Jupiter had but four, while at least one\r\nof the satellites of Saturn, named Titan, was larger than any satellite\r\nof Jupiter.[28] Some of the discoveries of Cassini had been made with\r\ntelescopes of quite monstrous dimensions. The length of the instrument,\r\nor rather the distance at which the object-glass was placed, was one\r\nhundred feet or more from the eye of the observer. It seemed hardly\r\npossible to push telescopic research farther with instruments of this\r\ncumbrous type. At length, however, the great reformation in the\r\nconstruction of astronomical instruments began to dawn. In the hands of\r\nHerschel, it was found possible to construct reflecting telescopes of\r\nmanageable dimensions, which were both more powerful and more accurate\r\nthan the long-focussed lenses of Cassini. A great instrument of this\r\nkind, forty feet long, just completed by Herschel, was directed to\r\nSaturn on the 28th of August, 1789. Never before had the wondrous planet\r\nbeen submitted to a scrutiny so minute. Herschel was familiar with the\r\nlabours of his predecessors. He had often looked at Saturn and his five\r\nmoons in inferior telescopes; now again he saw the five moons and a\r\nstar-like object so near the plane of the ring that he conjectured this\r\nto be a sixth satellite. A speedy method of testing this conjecture was\r\nat hand. Saturn was then moving rapidly over the heavens. If this new\r\nobject were in truth a satellite, then it must be carried on by Saturn.\r\nHerschel watched with anxiety to see whether this would be the case. A\r\nshort time sufficed to answer the question; in two hours and a half the\r\nplanet had moved to a distance quite appreciable, and had carried with\r\nhim not only the five satellites already known, but also this sixth\r\nobject. Had this been a star it would have been left behind; it was not\r\nleft behind, and hence it, too, was a satellite. Thus, after the long\r\nlapse of a century, the telescopic discovery of satellites to Saturn\r\nrecommenced. Herschel, as was his wont, observed this object with\r\nunremitting ardour, and discovered that it was much nearer to Saturn\r\nthan any of the previously known satellites. In accordance with the\r\ngeneral law, that the nearer the satellite the shorter the period of\r\nrevolution, Herschel found that this little moon completed a revolution\r\nin about 1 day, 8 hours, 53 minutes. The same great telescope, used with\r\nthe same unrivalled skill, soon led Herschel to a still more interesting\r\ndiscovery. An object so small as only to appear like a very minute\r\npoint in the great forty-foot reflector was also detected by Herschel,\r\nand was by him proved to be a satellite, so close to the planet that it\r\ncompleted a revolution in the very brief period of 22 hours and 37\r\nminutes. This is an extremely delicate object, only to be seen by the\r\nbest telescopes in the brief intervals when it is not entirely screened\r\nfrom view by the ring.\r\n\r\nAgain another long interval elapsed, and for almost fifty years the\r\nSaturnian system was regarded as consisting of the series of rings and\r\nof the seven satellites. The next discovery has a singular historical\r\ninterest. It was made simultaneously by two observers--Professor Bond,\r\nof Cambridge, Mass., and Mr. Lassell, of Liverpool--for on the 19th\r\nSeptember, 1848, both of these astronomers verified that a small point\r\nwhich they had each seen on previous nights was really a satellite. This\r\nobject is, however, at a considerable distance from the planet, and\r\nrequires 21 days, 7 hours, 28 minutes for each revolution; it is the\r\nseventh in order from the planet.\r\n\r\nYet one more extremely faint outer satellite was discerned by\r\nphotography on the 16th, 17th, and 18th August, 1898, by Professor W.H.\r\nPickering. This object is much more distant from the planet than the\r\nlarger and older satellites. Its motion has not yet been fully\r\ndetermined, but probably it requires not less than 490 days to perform a\r\nsingle revolution.\r\n\r\nFrom observations of the satellites it has been found that 3,500 globes\r\nas heavy as Saturn would weigh as much as the sun.\r\n\r\nA law has been observed by Professor Kirkwood, which connects together\r\nthe movements of the four interior satellites of Saturn. This law is\r\nfulfilled in such a manner as leads to the supposition that it arises\r\nfrom the mutual attraction of the satellites. We have already described\r\na similar law relative to three of the satellites of Jupiter. The\r\nproblem relating to Saturn, involving as it does no fewer than four\r\nsatellites, is one of no ordinary complexity. It involves the theory of\r\nPerturbations to a greater degree than that to which mathematicians are\r\naccustomed in their investigation of the more ordinary features of our\r\nsystem. To express this law it is necessary to have recourse to the\r\ndaily movements of the satellites; these are respectively--\r\n\r\n  SATELLITE.      DAILY MOVEMENT.\r\n          I.          382°·2.\r\n         II.          262°·74.\r\n        III.          190°·7.\r\n         IV.          131°·4.\r\n\r\nThe law states that if to five times the movement of the first satellite\r\nwe add that of the third and four times that of the fourth, the whole\r\nwill equal ten times the movement of the second satellite. The\r\ncalculation stands thus:--\r\n\r\n  5 times  I. equals 1911°·0\r\n         III. equals  190°·7     II. 262°·74\r\n  4 times IV. equals  525°·6              10\r\n                    --------        --------\r\n                     2627°·3  equal  2627°·4 nearly.\r\n\r\nNothing can be simpler than the verification of this law; but the task\r\nof showing the physical reason why it should be fulfilled has not yet\r\nbeen accomplished.\r\n\r\nSaturn was the most distant planet known to the ancients. It revolves in\r\nan orbit far outside the other ancient planets, and, until the discovery\r\nof Uranus in the year 1781, the orbit of Saturn might well be regarded\r\nas the frontier of the solar system. The ringed planet was indeed a\r\nworthy object to occupy a position so distinguished. But we now know\r\nthat the mighty orbit of Saturn does not extend to the frontiers of the\r\nsolar system; a splendid discovery, leading to one still more splendid,\r\nhas vastly extended the boundary, by revealing two mighty planets,\r\nrevolving in dim telescopic distance, far outside the path of Saturn.\r\nThese objects have not the beauty of Saturn; they are, indeed, in no\r\nsense effective telescopic pictures. Yet these outer planets awaken an\r\ninterest of a most special kind. The discovery of each is a classical\r\nevent in the history of astronomy, and the opinion has been maintained,\r\nand perhaps with reason, that the discovery of Neptune, the more remote\r\nof the two, is the greatest achievement in astronomy made since the time\r\nof Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nURANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Contrast between Uranus and the other great Planets--William\r\n     Herschel--His Birth and Parentage--Herschel's Arrival in\r\n     England--His Love of Learning--Commencement of his Astronomical\r\n     Studies--The Construction of Telescopes--Construction of\r\n     Mirrors--The Professor of Music becomes an Astronomer--The\r\n     Methodical Research--The 13th March, 1781--The Discovery of\r\n     Uranus--Delicacy of Observation--Was the Object a Comet?--The\r\n     Significance of this Discovery--The Fame of Herschel--George III.\r\n     and the Bath Musician--The King's Astronomer at Windsor--The Planet\r\n     Uranus--Numerical Data with reference thereto--The Four Satellites\r\n     of Uranus--Their Circular Orbits--Early Observations of\r\n     Uranus--Flamsteed's Observations--Lemonnier saw Uranus--Utility of\r\n     their Measurements--The Elliptic Path--The Great Problem thus\r\n     Suggested.\r\n\r\nTo the present writer it has always seemed that the history of Uranus,\r\nand of the circumstances attending its discovery, forms one of the most\r\npleasing and interesting episodes in the whole history of science. We\r\nhere occupy an entirely new position in the study of the solar system.\r\nAll the other great planets were familiarly known from antiquity,\r\nhowever erroneous might be the ideas entertained in connection with\r\nthem. They were conspicuous objects, and by their movements could hardly\r\nfail to attract the attention of those whose pursuits led them to\r\nobserve the stars. But now we come to a great planet, the very existence\r\nof which was utterly unknown to the ancients; and hence, in approaching\r\nthe subject, we have first to describe the actual discovery of this\r\nobject, and then to consider what we can learn as to its physical\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWe have, in preceding pages, had occasion to mention the revered name of\r\nWilliam Herschel in connection with various branches of astronomy; but\r\nwe have hitherto designedly postponed any more explicit reference to\r\nthis extraordinary man until we had arrived at the present stage of our\r\nwork. The story of Uranus, in its earlier stages at all events, is the\r\nstory of the early career of William Herschel. It would be alike\r\nimpossible and undesirable to attempt to separate them.\r\n\r\nWilliam Herschel, the illustrious astronomer, was born at Hanover in\r\n1738. His father was an accomplished man, pursuing, in a somewhat humble\r\nmanner, the calling of a professor of music. He had a family of ten\r\nchildren, of whom William was the fourth; and it may be noted that all\r\nthe members of the family of whom any record has been preserved\r\ninherited their father's musical talents, and became accomplished\r\nperformers. Pleasing sketches have been given of this interesting\r\nfamily, of the unusual aptitude of William, of the long discussions on\r\nmusic and on philosophy, and of the little sister Caroline, destined in\r\nlater years for an illustrious career. William soon learned all that his\r\nmaster could teach him in the ordinary branches of knowledge, and by the\r\nage of fourteen he was already a competent performer on the oboe and the\r\nviol. He was engaged in the Court orchestra at Hanover, and was also a\r\nmember of the band of the Hanoverian Guards. Troublous times were soon\r\nto break up Herschel's family. The French invaded Hanover, the\r\nHanoverian Guards were overthrown in the battle of Hastenbeck, and young\r\nWilliam Herschel had some unpleasant experience of actual warfare. His\r\nhealth was not very strong, and he decided that he would make a change\r\nin his profession. His method of doing so is one which his biographers\r\ncan scarcely be expected to defend; for, to speak plainly, he deserted,\r\nand succeeded in making his escape to England. It is stated on\r\nunquestionable authority that on Herschel's first visit to King George\r\nIII., more than twenty years afterwards, his pardon was handed to him by\r\nthe King himself, written out in due form.\r\n\r\nAt the age of nineteen the young musician began to seek his fortunes in\r\nEngland. He met at first with very considerable hardship, but industry\r\nand skill conquered all difficulties, and by the time he was twenty-six\r\nyears of age he was thoroughly settled in England, and doing well in his\r\nprofession. In the year 1766 we find Herschel occupying a position of\r\nsome distinction in the musical world; he had become the organist of the\r\nOctagon Chapel at Bath, and his time was fully employed in giving\r\nlessons to his numerous pupils, and with his preparation for concerts\r\nand oratorios.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his busy professional life, Herschel still retained that\r\ninsatiable thirst for knowledge which he had when a boy. Every moment he\r\ncould snatch from his musical engagements was eagerly devoted to study.\r\nIn his desire to perfect his knowledge of the more abstruse parts of the\r\ntheory of music he had occasion to learn mathematics; from mathematics\r\nthe transition to optics was a natural one; and once he had commenced to\r\nstudy optics, he was of course brought to a knowledge of the telescope,\r\nand thence to astronomy itself.\r\n\r\nHis beginnings were made on a very modest scale. It was through a small\r\nand imperfect telescope that the great astronomer obtained his first\r\nview of the celestial glories. No doubt he had often before looked at\r\nthe heavens on a clear night, and admired the thousands of stars with\r\nwhich they were adorned; but now, when he was able to increase his\r\npowers of vision even to a slight extent, he obtained a view which\r\nfascinated him. The stars he had seen before he now saw far more\r\ndistinctly; but, more than this, he found that myriads of others\r\npreviously invisible were now revealed to him. Glorious, indeed, is this\r\nspectacle to anyone who possesses a spark of enthusiasm for natural\r\nbeauty. To Herschel this view immediately changed the whole current of\r\nhis life. His success as a professor of music, his oratorios, and his\r\npupils were speedily to be forgotten, and the rest of his life was to be\r\ndevoted to the absorbing pursuit of one of the noblest of the sciences.\r\n\r\nHerschel could not remain contented with the small and imperfect\r\ninstrument which first interested him. Throughout his career he\r\ndetermined to see everything for himself in the best manner which his\r\nutmost powers could command. He at once decided to have a better\r\ninstrument, and he wrote to a celebrated optician in London with the\r\nview of making a purchase. But the price which the optician demanded\r\nseemed more than Herschel thought he could or ought to give. Instantly\r\nhis resolution was taken. A good telescope he must have, and as he could\r\nnot buy one he resolved to make one. It was alike fortunate, both for\r\nHerschel and for science, that circumstances impelled him to this\r\ndetermination. Yet, at first sight, how unpromising was the enterprise!\r\nThat a music teacher, busily employed day and night, should, without\r\nprevious training, expect to succeed in a task where the highest\r\nmechanical and optical skill was required, seemed indeed unlikely. But\r\nenthusiasm and genius know no insuperable difficulties. From conducting\r\na brilliant concert in Bath, when that city was at the height of its\r\nfame, Herschel would rush home, and without even delaying to take off\r\nhis lace ruffles, he would plunge into his manual labours of grinding\r\nspecula and polishing lenses. No alchemist of old was ever more deeply\r\nabsorbed in a project for turning lead into gold than was Herschel in\r\nhis determination to have a telescope. He transformed his home into a\r\nlaboratory; of his drawing-room he made a carpenter's shop. Turning\r\nlathes were the furniture of his best bedroom. A telescope he must have,\r\nand as he progressed he determined, not only that he should have a good\r\ntelescope, but a very good one; and as success cheered his efforts he\r\nultimately succeeded in constructing the greatest telescope that the\r\nworld had up to that time ever seen. Though it is as an astronomer that\r\nwe are concerned with Herschel, yet we must observe even as a telescope\r\nmaker also great fame and no small degree of commercial success flowed\r\nin upon him. When the world began to ring with his glorious discoveries,\r\nand when it was known that he used no other telescopes than those which\r\nwere the work of his own hands, a demand sprang up for instruments of\r\nhis construction. It is stated that he made upwards of eighty large\r\ntelescopes, as well as many others of smaller size. Several of these\r\ninstruments were purchased by foreign princes and potentates.[29] We\r\nhave never heard that any of these illustrious personages became\r\ncelebrated astronomers, but, at all events, they seem to have paid\r\nHerschel handsomely for his skill, so that by the sale of large\r\ntelescopes he was enabled to realise what may be regarded as a fortune\r\nin the moderate horizon of the man of science.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of his life Herschel was unknown to the public except\r\nas a laborious musician, with considerable renown in his profession, not\r\nonly in Bath, but throughout the West of England. His telescope-making\r\nwas merely the occupation of his spare moments, and was unheard of by\r\nmost of those who knew and respected his musical attainments. It was in\r\n1774 that Herschel first enjoyed a view of the heavens through an\r\ninstrument built with his own hands. It was but a small one in\r\ncomparison with those which he afterwards fashioned, but at once he\r\nexperienced the advantage of being his own instrument maker. Night after\r\nnight he was able to add the improvements which experience suggested; at\r\none time he was enlarging the mirrors; at another he was reconstructing\r\nthe mounting, or trying to remedy defects in the eye-pieces. With\r\nunwearying perseverance he aimed at the highest excellence, and with\r\neach successive advance he found that he was able to pierce further into\r\nthe sky. His enthusiasm attracted a few friends who were, like himself,\r\nardently attached to science. The mode in which he first made the\r\nacquaintance of Sir William Watson, who afterwards became his warmest\r\nfriend, was characteristic of both. Herschel was observing the mountains\r\nin the moon, and as the hours passed on, he had occasion to bring his\r\ntelescope into the street in front of his house to enable him to\r\ncontinue his work. Sir William Watson happened to pass by, and was\r\narrested by the unusual spectacle of an astronomer in the public street,\r\nat the dead of night, using a large and quaint-looking instrument.\r\nHaving a taste for astronomy, Sir William stopped, and when Herschel\r\ntook his eye from the telescope, asked if he might be allowed to have a\r\nlook at the moon. The request was readily granted. Probably Herschel\r\nfound but few in the gay city who cared for such matters; he was quickly\r\ndrawn to Sir W. Watson, who at once reciprocated the feeling, and thus\r\nbegan a friendship which bore important fruit in Herschel's subsequent\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nAt length the year 1781 approached, which was to witness his great\r\nachievement. Herschel had made good use of seven years' practical\r\nexperience in astronomy, and he had completed a telescope of exquisite\r\noptical perfection, though greatly inferior in size to some of those\r\nwhich he afterwards erected. With this reflector Herschel commenced a\r\nmethodical piece of observation. He formed the scheme of systematically\r\nexamining all the stars which were above a certain degree of brightness.\r\nIt does not quite appear what object Herschel proposed to himself when\r\nhe undertook this labour, but, in any case, he could hardly have\r\nanticipated the extraordinary success with which the work was to be\r\ncrowned. In the course of this review the telescope was directed to a\r\nstar; that star was examined; then another was brought into the field of\r\nview, and it too was examined. Every star under such circumstances\r\nmerely shows itself as a point of light; the point may be brilliant or\r\nnot, according as the star is bright or not; the point will also, of\r\ncourse, show the colour of the star, but it cannot exhibit recognisable\r\nsize or shape. The greater, in fact, the perfection of the telescope,\r\nthe smaller is the telescopic image of a star.\r\n\r\nHow many stars Herschel inspected in this review we are not told; but at\r\nall events, on the ever-memorable night of the 13th of March, 1781, he\r\nwas pursuing his self-allotted task among the hosts in the constellation\r\nGemini. Doubtless, one star after another was admitted to view, and was\r\nallowed to pass away. At length, however, an object was placed in the\r\nfield which differed from every other star. It was not a mere point of\r\nlight; it had a minute, but still a perfectly recognisable, disc. We say\r\nthe disc was perfectly recognisable, but we should be careful to add\r\nthat it was so in the excellent telescope of Herschel alone. Other\r\nastronomers had seen this object before. Its position had actually been\r\nmeasured no fewer than nineteen times before the Bath musician, with his\r\nhome-made telescope, looked at it, but the previous observers had only\r\nseen it in small meridian instruments with low magnifying powers. Even\r\nafter the discovery was made, and when well-trained observers with good\r\ninstruments looked again under the direction of Herschel, one after\r\nanother bore testimony to the extraordinary delicacy of the great\r\nastronomer's perception, which enabled him almost at the first glance to\r\ndiscriminate between it and a star.\r\n\r\nIf not a star, what, then, could it be? The first step to enable this\r\nquestion to be answered was to observe the body for some time. This\r\nHerschel did. He looked at it one night after another, and soon he\r\ndiscovered another fundamental difference between this object and an\r\nordinary star. The stars are, of course, characterised by their fixity,\r\nbut this object was not fixed; night after night the place it occupied\r\nchanged with respect to the stars. No longer could there be any doubt\r\nthat this body was a member of the solar system, and that an interesting\r\ndiscovery had been made; many months, however, elapsed before Herschel\r\nknew the real merit of his achievement. He did not realise that he had\r\nmade the superb discovery of another mighty planet revolving outside\r\nSaturn; he thought that it could only be a comet. No doubt this object\r\nlooked very different from a great comet, decorated with a tail. It was\r\nnot, however, so entirely different from some forms of telescopic comets\r\nas to make the suggestion of its being a body of this kind unlikely; and\r\nthe discovery was at first announced in accordance with this view. Time\r\nwas necessary before the true character of the object could be\r\nascertained. It must be followed for a considerable distance along its\r\npath, and measures of its position at different epochs must be effected,\r\nbefore it is practicable for the mathematician to calculate the path\r\nwhich the body pursues; once, however, attention was devoted to the\r\nsubject, many astronomers aided in making the necessary observations.\r\nThese were placed in the hands of mathematicians, and the result was\r\nproclaimed that this body was not a comet, but that, like all the\r\nplanets, it revolved in nearly a circular path around the sun, and that\r\nthe path lay millions of miles outside the path of Saturn, which had so\r\nlong been regarded as the boundary of the solar system.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to over-estimate the significance of this splendid\r\ndiscovery. The five planets had been known from all antiquity; they were\r\nall, at suitable seasons, brilliantly conspicuous to the unaided eye.\r\nBut it was now found that, far outside the outermost of these planets\r\nrevolved another splendid planet, larger than Mercury or Mars,\r\nlarger--far larger--than Venus and the earth, and only surpassed in bulk\r\nby Jupiter and by Saturn. This superb new planet was plunged into space\r\nto such a depth that, notwithstanding its noble proportions, it seemed\r\nmerely a tiny star, being only on rare occasions within reach of the\r\nunaided eye. This great globe required a period of eighty-four years to\r\ncomplete its majestic path, and the diameter of that path was\r\n3,600,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAlthough the history of astronomy is the record of brilliant\r\ndiscoveries--of the labours of Copernicus, and of Kepler--of the\r\ntelescopic achievements of Galileo, and the splendid theory of\r\nNewton--of the refined discovery of the aberration of light--of many\r\nother imperishable triumphs of intellect--yet this achievement of the\r\norganist at the Octagon Chapel occupies a totally different position\r\nfrom any other. There never before had been any historic record of the\r\ndiscovery of one of the bodies of the particular system to which the\r\nearth belongs. The older planets were no doubt discovered by someone,\r\nbut we can say little more about these discoveries than we can about the\r\ndiscovery of the sun or of the moon; all are alike prehistoric. Here was\r\nthe first recorded instance of the discovery of a planet which, like the\r\nearth, revolves around the sun, and, like our earth, may conceivably be\r\nan inhabited globe. So unique an achievement instantly arrested the\r\nattention of the whole scientific world. The music-master at Bath,\r\nhitherto unheard of as an astronomer, was speedily placed in the very\r\nforemost rank of those entitled to the name. On all sides the greatest\r\ninterest was manifested about the unknown philosopher. The name of\r\nHerschel, then unfamiliar to English ears, appeared in every journal,\r\nand a curious list has been preserved of the number of blunders which\r\nwere made in spelling the name. The different scientific societies\r\nhastened to convey their congratulations on an occasion so memorable.\r\n\r\nTidings of the discovery made by the Hanoverian musician reached the\r\nears of George III., and he sent for Herschel to come to the Court, that\r\nthe King might learn what his achievement actually was from the\r\ndiscoverer's own lips. Herschel brought with him one of his telescopes,\r\nand he provided himself with a chart of the solar system, with which to\r\nexplain precisely wherein the significance of the discovery lay. The\r\nKing was greatly interested in Herschel's narrative, and not less in\r\nHerschel himself. The telescope was erected at Windsor, and, under the\r\nastronomer's guidance, the King was shown Saturn and other celebrated\r\nobjects. It is also told how the ladies of the Court the next day asked\r\nHerschel to show them the wonders which had so pleased the King. The\r\ntelescope was duly erected in a window of one of the Queen's apartments,\r\nbut when evening arrived the sky was found to be overcast with clouds,\r\nand no stars could be seen. This was an experience with which Herschel,\r\nlike every other astronomer, was unhappily only too familiar. But it is\r\nnot every astronomer who would have shown the readiness of Herschel in\r\nescaping gracefully from the position. He showed to his lady pupils the\r\nconstruction of the telescope; he explained the mirror, and how he had\r\nfashioned it and given the polish; and then, seeing the clouds were\r\ninexorable, he proposed that, as he could not show them the real Saturn,\r\nhe should exhibit an artificial one as the best substitute. The\r\npermission granted, Herschel turned the telescope away from the sky, and\r\npointed it towards the wall of a distant garden. On looking into the\r\ntelescope there was Saturn, his globe and his system of rings, so\r\nfaithfully shown that, says Herschel, even a skilful astronomer might\r\nhave been deceived. The fact was that during the course of the day\r\nHerschel saw that the sky would probably be overcast in the evening, and\r\nhe had provided for the emergency by cutting a hole in a piece of\r\ncardboard, the shape of Saturn, which was then placed against the\r\ndistant garden wall, and illuminated by a lamp at the back.\r\n\r\nThis visit to Windsor was productive of consequences momentous to\r\nHerschel, momentous to science. He had made so favourable an impression,\r\nthat the King proposed to create for him the special appointment of\r\nKing's Astronomer at Windsor. The King was to provide the means for\r\nerecting the great telescopes, and he allocated to Herschel a salary of\r\n£200 a year, the figures being based, it must be admitted, on a somewhat\r\nmoderate estimate of the requirements of an astronomer's household.\r\nHerschel mentioned these particulars to no one save to his constant and\r\ngenerous friend, Sir W. Watson, who exclaimed, \"Never bought monarch\r\nhonour so cheap.\" To other enquirers, Herschel merely said that the King\r\nhad provided for him. In accepting this post, the great astronomer took\r\nno doubt a serious step. He at once sacrificed entirely his musical\r\ncareer, now, from many sources, a lucrative one; but his determination\r\nwas speedily taken. The splendid earnest that he had already given of\r\nhis devotion to astronomy was, he knew, only the commencement of a\r\nseries of memorable labours. He had indeed long been feeling that it was\r\nhis bounden duty to follow that path in life which his genius indicated.\r\nHe was no longer a young man. He had attained middle age, and the years\r\nhad become especially precious to one who knew that he had still a\r\nlife-work to accomplish. He at one stroke freed himself from all\r\ndistractions; his pupils and concerts, his whole connection at Bath,\r\nwere immediately renounced; he accepted the King's offer with alacrity,\r\nand after one or two changes settled permanently at Slough, near\r\nWindsor.\r\n\r\nIt has, indeed, been well remarked that the most important event in\r\nconnection with the discovery of Uranus was the discovery of Herschel's\r\nunrivalled powers of observation. Uranus must, sooner or later, have\r\nbeen found. Had Herschel not lived, we would still, no doubt, have known\r\nUranus long ere this. The really important point for science was that\r\nHerschel's genius should be given full scope, by setting him free from\r\nthe engrossing details of an ordinary professional calling. The\r\ndiscovery of Uranus secured all this, and accordingly obtained for\r\nastronomy all Herschel's future labours.[30]\r\n\r\nUranus is so remote that even the best of our modern telescopes cannot\r\nmake of it a striking picture. We can see, as Herschel did, that it has\r\na measurable disc, and from measurements of that disc we conclude that\r\nthe diameter of the planet is about 31,700 miles. This is about four\r\ntimes as great as the diameter of the earth, and we accordingly see that\r\nthe volume of Uranus must be about sixty-four times as great as that of\r\nthe earth. We also find that, like the other giant planets, Uranus seems\r\nto be composed of materials much lighter, on the whole, than those we\r\nfind here; so that, though sixty-four times as large as the earth,\r\nUranus is only fifteen times as heavy. If we may trust to the analogies\r\nof what we see everywhere else in our system, we can feel but little\r\ndoubt that Uranus must rotate about an axis. The ordinary means of\r\ndemonstrating this rotation can be hardly available in a body whose\r\nsurface appears so small and so faint. The period of rotation is\r\naccordingly unknown. The spectroscope tells us that a remarkable\r\natmosphere, containing apparently some gases foreign to our own, deeply\r\nenvelops Uranus.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one feature about Uranus which presents many points\r\nof interest to those astronomers who are possessed of telescopes of\r\nunusual size and perfection. Uranus is accompanied by a system of\r\nsatellites, some of which are so faint as to require the closest\r\nscrutiny for their detection. The discovery of these satellites was one\r\nof the subsequent achievements of Herschel. It is, however, remarkable\r\nthat even his penetration and care did not preserve him from errors\r\nwith regard to these very delicate objects. Some of the points which he\r\nthought to be satellites must, it would now seem, have been merely stars\r\nenormously more distant, which happened to lie in the field of view. It\r\nhas been since ascertained that the known satellites of Uranus are four\r\nin number, and their movements have been made the subject of prolonged\r\nand interesting telescopic research. The four satellites bear the names\r\nof Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Arranged in order of their\r\ndistance from the central body, Ariel, the nearest, accomplishes its\r\njourney in 2 days and 12 hours. Oberon, the most distant, completes its\r\njourney in 13 days and 11 hours.\r\n\r\nThe law of Kepler declares that the path of a satellite around its\r\nprimary, no less than of the primary around the sun, must be an ellipse.\r\nIt leaves, however, boundless latitude in the actual eccentricity of the\r\ncurve. The ellipse may be nearly a circle, it may be absolutely a\r\ncircle, or it may be something quite different from a circle. The paths\r\npursued by the planets are, generally speaking, nearly circles; but we\r\nmeet with no exact circle among planetary orbits. So far as we at\r\npresent know, the closest approach made to a perfectly circular movement\r\nis that by which the satellites of Uranus revolve around their primary.\r\nWe are not prepared to say that these paths are absolutely circular. All\r\nthat can be said is that our telescopes fail to show any measurable\r\ndeparture therefrom. It is also to be noted as an interesting\r\ncircumstance that the orbits of the satellites of Uranus all lie in the\r\nsame plane. This is not true of the orbits of the planets around the\r\nsun, nor is it true of the orbits of any other system of satellites\r\naround their primary. The most singular circumstance attending the\r\nUranian system is, however, found in the position which this plane\r\noccupies. This is indeed almost as great an anomaly in our system as are\r\nthe rings of Saturn themselves. We have already had occasion to notice\r\nthat the plane in which the earth revolves around the sun is very nearly\r\ncoincident with the planes in which all the other great planets revolve.\r\nThe same is true, to a large extent, of the orbits of the minor planets;\r\nthough here, no doubt, we meet with a few cases in which the plane of\r\nthe orbit is inclined at no inconsiderable angle to the plane in which\r\nthe earth moves. The plane in which the moon revolves also approximates\r\nto this system of planetary planes. So, too, do the orbits of the\r\nsatellites of Saturn and of Jupiter, while even the more recently\r\ndiscovered satellites of Mars form no exception to the rule. The whole\r\nsolar system--at least so far as the great planets are concerned--would\r\nrequire comparatively little alteration if the orbits were to be\r\nentirely flattened down into one plane. There are, however, some notable\r\nexceptions to this rule. The satellites of Uranus revolve in a plane\r\nwhich is far from coinciding with the plane to which all other orbits\r\napproximate. In fact, the paths of the satellites of Uranus lie in a\r\nplane nearly at right angles to the orbit of Uranus. We are not in a\r\nposition to give any satisfactory explanation of this circumstance. It\r\nis, however, evident that in the genesis of the Uranian system there\r\nmust have been some influence of a quite exceptional and local\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSoon after the discovery of the planet Uranus, in 1781, sufficient\r\nobservations were accumulated to enable the orbit it follows to be\r\ndetermined. When the path was known, it was then a mere matter of\r\nmathematical calculation to ascertain where the planet was situated at\r\nany past time, and where it would be situated at any future time. An\r\ninteresting enquiry was thus originated as to how far it might be\r\npossible to find any observations of the planet made previously to its\r\ndiscovery by Herschel. Uranus looks like a star of the sixth magnitude.\r\nNot many astronomers were provided with telescopes of the perfection\r\nattained by Herschel, and the personal delicacy of perception\r\ncharacteristic of Herschel was a still more rare possession. It was,\r\ntherefore, to be expected that, if such previous observations existed,\r\nthey would merely record Uranus as a star visible, and indeed bright, in\r\na moderate telescope, but still not claiming any exceptional attention\r\nover thousands of apparently similar stars. Many of the early\r\nastronomers had devoted themselves to the useful and laborious work of\r\nforming catalogues of stars. In the preparation of a star catalogue, the\r\ntelescope was directed to the heavens, the stars were observed, their\r\nplaces were carefully measured, the brightness of the star was also\r\nestimated, and thus the catalogue was gradually compiled in which each\r\nstar had its place faithfully recorded, so that at any future time it\r\ncould be identified. The stars were thus registered, by hundreds and by\r\nthousands, at various dates from the birth of accurate astronomy till\r\nthe present time. The suggestion was then made that, as Uranus looked so\r\nlike a star, and as it was quite bright enough to have engaged the\r\nattention of astronomers possessed of even very moderate instrumental\r\npowers, there was a possibility that it had already been observed, and\r\nthus actually lay recorded as a star in some of the older catalogues.\r\nThis was indeed an idea worthy of every attention, and pregnant with the\r\nmost important consequences in connection with the immortal discovery to\r\nbe discussed in our next chapter. But how was such an examination of the\r\ncatalogues to be conducted? Uranus is constantly moving about; does it\r\nnot seem that there is every element of uncertainty in such an\r\ninvestigation? Let us consider a notable example.\r\n\r\nThe great national observatory at Greenwich was founded in 1675, and the\r\nfirst Astronomer-Royal was the illustrious Flamsteed, who in 1676\r\ncommenced that series of observations of the heavenly bodies which has\r\nbeen continued to the present day with such incalculable benefits to\r\nscience. At first the instruments were of a rather primitive\r\ndescription, but in the course of some years Flamsteed succeeded in\r\nprocuring instruments adequate to the production of a catalogue of\r\nstars, and he devoted himself with extraordinary zeal to the\r\nundertaking. It is in this memorable work, the \"Historia Coelestis\" of\r\nFlamsteed, that the earliest observation of Uranus is recorded. In the\r\nfirst place it was known that the orbit of this body, like the orbit of\r\nevery other great planet, was inclined at a very small angle to the\r\necliptic. It hence follows that Uranus is at all times only to be met\r\nwith along the ecliptic, and it is possible to calculate where the\r\nplanet has been in each year. It was thus seen that in 1690 the planet\r\nwas situated in that part of the ecliptic where Flamsteed was at the\r\nsame date making his observations. It was natural to search the\r\nobservations of Flamsteed, and see whether any of the so-called stars\r\ncould have been Uranus. An object was found in the \"Historia\r\nCoelestis\" which occupied a position identical with that which Uranus\r\nmust have filled on the same date. Could this be Uranus? A decisive test\r\nwas at once available. The telescope was directed to the spot in the\r\nheavens where Flamsteed saw a sixth-magnitude star. If that were really\r\na star, then would it still be visible. The trial was made: no such star\r\ncould be found, and hence the presumption that this was really Uranus\r\ncould hardly be for a moment doubted. Speedily other confirmation flowed\r\nin. It was shown that Uranus had been observed by Bradley and by Tobias\r\nMayer, and it also became apparent that Flamsteed had observed Uranus\r\nnot only once, but that he had actually measured its place four times in\r\nthe years 1712 and 1715. Yet Flamsteed was never conscious of the\r\ndiscovery that lay so nearly in his grasp. He was, of course, under the\r\nimpression that all these observations related to different stars. A\r\nstill more remarkable case is that of Lemonnier, who had actually\r\nobserved Uranus twelve times, and even recorded it on four consecutive\r\ndays in January, 1769. If Lemonnier had only carefully looked over his\r\nown work; if he had perceived, as he might have done, how the star he\r\nobserved yesterday was gone to-day, while the star visible to-day had\r\nmoved away by to-morrow, there is no doubt that Uranus would have been\r\ndiscovered, and William Herschel would have been anticipated. Would\r\nLemonnier have made as good use of his fame as Herschel did? This seems\r\na question which can never be decided, but those who estimate Herschel\r\nas the present writer thinks he ought to be estimated, will probably\r\nagree in thinking that it was most fortunate for science that Lemonnier\r\ndid _not_ compare his observations.[31]\r\n\r\nThese early accidental observations of Uranus are not merely to be\r\nregarded as matters of historical interest or curiosity. That they are\r\nof the deepest importance with regard to the science itself a few words\r\nwill enable us to show. It is to be remembered that Uranus requires no\r\nless than eighty-four years to accomplish his mighty revolution around\r\nthe sun. The planet has completed one entire revolution since its\r\ndiscovery, and up to the present time (1900) has accomplished more than\r\none-third of another. For the careful study of the nature of the orbit,\r\nit was desirable to have as many measurements as possible, and extending\r\nover the widest possible interval. This was in a great measure secured\r\nby the identification of the early observations of Uranus. An\r\napproximate knowledge of the orbit was quite capable of giving the\r\nplaces of the planet with sufficient accuracy to identify it when met\r\nwith in the catalogues. But when by their aid the actual observations\r\nhave been discovered, they tell us precisely the place of Uranus; and\r\nhence, instead of our knowledge of the planet being limited to but\r\nlittle more than one revolution, we have at the present time information\r\nwith regard to it extending over considerably more than two revolutions.\r\n\r\nFrom the observations of the planet the ellipse in which it moves can be\r\nascertained. We can compute this ellipse from the observations made\r\nduring the time since the discovery. We can also compute the ellipse\r\nfrom the early observations made before the discovery. If Kepler's laws\r\nwere rigorously verified, then, of course, the ellipse performed in the\r\npresent revolution must differ in no respect from the ellipse performed\r\nin the preceding, or indeed in any other revolution. We can test this\r\npoint in an interesting manner by comparing the ellipse derived from the\r\nancient observations with that deduced from the modern ones. These\r\nellipses closely resemble each other; they are nearly the same; but it\r\nis most important to observe that they are not _exactly_ the same, even\r\nwhen allowance has been made for every known source of disturbance in\r\naccordance with the principles explained in the next chapter. The law of\r\nKepler seems thus not absolutely true in the case of Uranus. Here is,\r\nindeed, a matter demanding our most earnest and careful attention. Have\r\nwe not repeatedly laid down the universality of the laws of Kepler in\r\ncontrolling the planetary motions? How then can we reconcile this law\r\nwith the irregularities proved beyond a doubt to exist in the motions of\r\nUranus?\r\n\r\nLet us look a little more closely into the matter. We know that the laws\r\nof Kepler are a consequence of the laws of gravitation. We know that the\r\nplanet moves in an elliptic path around the sun, in virtue of the sun's\r\nattraction, and we know that the ellipse will be preserved without the\r\nminutest alteration if the sun and the planet be left to their mutual\r\nattractions, and if no other force intervene. We can also calculate the\r\ninfluence of each of the known planets on the form and position of the\r\norbit. But when allowance is made for all such perturbing influences it\r\nis found that the observed and computed orbits do not agree. The\r\nconclusion is irresistible. Uranus does not move solely in consequence\r\nof the sun's attraction and that of the planets of our system interior\r\nto Uranus; there must therefore be some further influence acting upon\r\nUranus besides those already known. To the development of this subject\r\nthe next chapter will be devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nNEPTUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Discovery of Neptune--A Mathematical Achievement--The Sun's\r\n     Attraction--All Bodies attract--Jupiter and Saturn--The Planetary\r\n     Perturbations--Three Bodies--Nature has simplified the\r\n     Problem--Approximate Solution--The Sources of Success--The Problem\r\n     Stated for the Earth--The Discoveries of Lagrange--The\r\n     Eccentricity--Necessity that all the Planets revolve in the same\r\n     Direction--Lagrange's Discoveries have not the Dramatic Interest of\r\n     the more Recent Achievements--The Irregularities of Uranus--The\r\n     Unknown Planet must revolve outside the Path of Uranus--The Data\r\n     for the Problem--Le Verrier and Adams both investigate the\r\n     Question--Adams indicates the Place of the Planet--How the Search\r\n     was to be conducted--Le Verrier also solves the Problem--The\r\n     Telescopic Discovery of the Planet--The Rival Claims--Early\r\n     Observation of Neptune--Difficulty of the Telescopic Study of\r\n     Neptune--Numerical Details of the Orbit--Is there any Outer\r\n     Planet?--Contrast between Mercury and Neptune.\r\n\r\nWe describe in this chapter a discovery so extraordinary that the whole\r\nannals of science may be searched in vain for a parallel. We are not\r\nhere concerned with technicalities of practical astronomy. Neptune was\r\nfirst revealed by profound mathematical research rather than by minute\r\ntelescopic investigation. We must develop the account of this striking\r\nepoch in the history of science with the fulness of detail which is\r\ncommensurate with its importance; and it will accordingly be necessary,\r\nat the outset of our narrative, to make an excursion into a difficult\r\nbut attractive department of astronomy, to which we have as yet made\r\nlittle reference.\r\n\r\nThe supreme controlling power in the solar system is the attraction of\r\nthe sun. Each planet of the system experiences that attraction, and, in\r\nvirtue thereof, is constrained to revolve around the sun in an elliptic\r\npath. The efficiency of a body as an attractive agent is directly\r\nproportional to its mass, and as the mass of the sun is more than a\r\nthousand times as great as that of Jupiter, which, itself, exceeds that\r\nof all the other planets collectively, the attraction of the sun is\r\nnecessarily the chief determining force of the movements in our system.\r\nThe law of gravitation, however, does not merely say that the sun\r\nattracts each planet. Gravitation is a doctrine much more general, for\r\nit asserts that every body in the universe attracts every other body. In\r\nobedience to this law, each planet must be attracted, not only by the\r\nsun, but by innumerable bodies, and the movement of the planet must be\r\nthe joint effect of all such attractions. As for the influence of the\r\nstars on our solar system, it may be at once set aside as inappreciable.\r\nThe stars are no doubt enormous bodies, in many cases possibly\r\ntranscending the sun in magnitude, but the law of gravitation tells us\r\nthat the intensity of the attraction decreases as the square of the\r\ndistance increases. Most of the stars are a million times as remote as\r\nthe sun, and consequently their attraction is so slight as to be\r\nabsolutely inappreciable in the discussion of this question. The only\r\nattractions we need consider are those which arise from the action of\r\none body of the system upon another. Let us take, for instance, the two\r\nlargest planets of our system, Jupiter and Saturn. Each of these globes\r\nrevolves mainly in consequence of the sun's attraction, but every planet\r\nalso attracts every other, and the consequence is that each one is\r\nslightly drawn away from the position it would have otherwise occupied.\r\nIn the language of astronomy, we would say that the path of Jupiter is\r\nperturbed by the attraction of Saturn; and, conversely, that the path of\r\nSaturn is perturbed by the attraction of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nFor many years these irregularities of the planetary motions presented\r\nproblems with which astronomers were not able to cope. Gradually,\r\nhowever, one difficulty after another has been vanquished, and though\r\nthere are no doubt some small irregularities still outstanding which\r\nhave not been completely explained, yet all the larger and more\r\nimportant phenomena of the kind are well understood. The subject is one\r\nof the most difficult which the astronomer has to encounter in the\r\nwhole range of his science. He has here to calculate what effect one\r\nplanet is capable of producing on another planet. Such calculations\r\nbristle with formidable difficulties, and can only be overcome by\r\nconsummate skill in the loftiest branches of mathematics. Let us state\r\nwhat the problem really is.\r\n\r\nWhen two bodies move in virtue of their mutual attraction, both of them\r\nwill revolve in a curve which admits of being exactly ascertained. Each\r\npath is, in fact, an ellipse, and they must have a common focus at the\r\ncentre of gravity of the two bodies, considered as a single system. In\r\nthe case of a sun and a planet, in which the mass of the sun\r\npreponderates enormously over the mass of the planet, the centre of\r\ngravity of the two lies very near the centre of the sun; the path of the\r\ngreat body is in such a case very small in comparison with the path of\r\nthe planet. All these matters admit of perfectly accurate calculation of\r\na somewhat elementary character. But now let us add a third body to the\r\nsystem which attracts each of the others and is attracted by them. In\r\nconsequence of this attraction, the third body is displaced, and\r\naccordingly its influence on the others is modified; they in turn act\r\nupon it, and these actions and reactions introduce endless complexity\r\ninto the system. Such is the famous \"problem of three bodies,\" which has\r\nengaged the attention of almost every great mathematician since the time\r\nof Newton. Stated in its mathematical aspect, and without having its\r\nintricacy abated by any modifying circumstances, the problem is one that\r\ndefies solution. Mathematicians have not yet been able to deal with the\r\nmutual attractions of three bodies moving freely in space. If the number\r\nof bodies be greater than three, as is actually the case in the solar\r\nsystem, the problem becomes still more hopeless.\r\n\r\nNature, however, has in this matter dealt kindly with us. She has, it is\r\ntrue, proposed a problem which cannot be accurately solved; but she has\r\nintroduced into the problem, as proposed in the solar system, certain\r\nspecial features which materially reduce the difficulty. We are still\r\nunable to make what a mathematician would describe as a rigorous\r\nsolution of the question; we cannot solve it with the completeness of a\r\nsum in arithmetic; but we can do what is nearly if not quite as useful.\r\nWe can solve the problem approximately; we can find out what the effect\r\nof one planet on the other is _very nearly_, and by additional labour we\r\ncan reduce the limits of uncertainty to as low a point as may be\r\ndesired. We thus obtain a practical solution of the problem adequate for\r\nall the purposes of science. It avails us little to know the place of a\r\nplanet with absolute mathematical accuracy. If we can determine what we\r\nwant with so close an approximation to the true position that no\r\ntelescope could possibly disclose the difference, then every practical\r\nend will have been attained. The reason why in this case we are enabled\r\nto get round the difficulties which we cannot surmount lies in the\r\nexceptional character of the problem of three bodies as exhibited in the\r\nsolar system. In the first place, the sun is of such pre-eminent mass\r\nthat many matters may be overlooked which would be of moment were he\r\nrivalled in mass by any of the planets. Another source of our success\r\narises from the small inclinations of the planetary orbits to each\r\nother; while the fact that the orbits are nearly circular also greatly\r\nfacilitates the work. The mathematicians who may reside in some of the\r\nother parts of the universe are not equally favoured. Among the sidereal\r\nsystems we find not a few cases where the problem of three bodies, or\r\neven of more than three, would have to be faced without any of the\r\nalleviating circumstances which our system presents. In such groups as\r\nthe marvellous star Th Orionis, we have three or four bodies\r\ncomparable in size, which must produce movements of the utmost\r\ncomplexity. Even if terrestrial mathematicians shall ever have the\r\nhardihood to face such problems, there is no likelihood of their being\r\nable to do so for ages to come; such researches must repose on accurate\r\nobservations as their foundation; and the observations of these distant\r\nsystems are at present utterly inadequate for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe undisturbed revolution of a planet around the sun, in conformity\r\nwith Kepler's law, would assure for that planet permanent conditions of\r\nclimate. The earth, for instance, if guided solely by Kepler's laws,\r\nwould return each day of the year exactly to the same position which it\r\nhad on the same day of last year. From age to age the quantity of heat\r\nreceived by the earth would remain constant if the sun continued\r\nunaltered, and the present climate might thus be preserved indefinitely.\r\nBut since the existence of planetary perturbation has become recognised,\r\nquestions arise of the gravest importance with reference to the possible\r\neffects which such perturbations may have. We now see that the path of\r\nthe earth is not absolutely fixed. That path is deranged by Venus and by\r\nMars; it is deranged, it must be deranged, by every planet in our\r\nsystem. It is true that in a year, or even in a century, the amount of\r\nalteration produced is not very great; the ellipse which represents the\r\npath of our earth this year does not differ considerably from the\r\nellipse which represented the movement of the earth one hundred years\r\nago. But the important question arises as to whether the slight\r\ndifference which does exist may not be constantly increasing, and may\r\nnot ultimately assume such proportions as to modify our climates, or\r\neven to render life utterly impossible. Indeed, if we look at the\r\nsubject without attentive calculation, nothing would seem more probable\r\nthan that such should be the fate of our system. This globe revolves in\r\na path inside that of the mighty Jupiter. It is, therefore, constantly\r\nattracted by Jupiter, and when it overtakes the vast planet, and comes\r\nbetween him and the sun, then the two bodies are comparatively close\r\ntogether, and the earth is pulled outwards by Jupiter. It might be\r\nsupposed that the tendency of such disturbances would be to draw the\r\nearth gradually away from the sun, and thus to cause our globe to\r\ndescribe a path ever growing wider and wider. It is not, however,\r\npossible to decide a dynamical question by merely superficial reasoning\r\nof this character. The question has to be brought before the tribunal of\r\nmathematical analysis, where every element in the case is duly taken\r\ninto account. Such an enquiry is by no means a simple one. It worthily\r\noccupied the splendid talents of Lagrange and Laplace, whose\r\ndiscoveries in the theory of planetary perturbation are some of the most\r\nremarkable achievements in astronomy.\r\n\r\nWe cannot here attempt to describe the reasoning which these great\r\nmathematicians employed. It can only be expressed by the formulæ of the\r\nmathematician, and would then be hardly intelligible without previous\r\nyears of mathematical study. It fortunately happens, however, that the\r\nresults to which Lagrange and Laplace were conducted, and which have\r\nbeen abundantly confirmed by the labours of other mathematicians, admit\r\nof being described in simple language.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the case of the sun, and of two planets circulating\r\naround him. These two planets are mutually disturbing each other, but\r\nthe amount of the disturbance is small in comparison with the effect of\r\nthe sun on each of them. Lagrange demonstrated that, though the ellipse\r\nin which each planet moved was gradually altered in some respects by the\r\nattraction of the other planet, yet there is one feature of the curve\r\nwhich the perturbation is powerless to alter permanently: the longest\r\naxis of the ellipse, and, therefore, the mean distance of the planet\r\nfrom the sun, which is equal to one-half of it, must remain unchanged.\r\nThis is really a discovery as important as it was unexpected. It at once\r\nremoves all fear as to the effect which perturbations can produce on the\r\nstability of the system. It shows that, notwithstanding the attractions\r\nof Mars and of Venus, of Jupiter and of Saturn, our earth will for ever\r\ncontinue to revolve at the same mean distance from the sun, and thus the\r\nsuccession of the seasons and the length of the year, so far as this\r\nelement at least is concerned, will remain for ever unchanged.\r\n\r\nBut Lagrange went further into the enquiry. He saw that the mean\r\ndistance did not alter, but it remained to be seen whether the\r\neccentricity of the ellipse described by the earth might not be affected\r\nby the perturbations. This is a matter of hardly less consequence than\r\nthat just referred to. Even though the earth preserved the same average\r\ndistance from the sun, yet the greatest and least distance might be\r\nwidely unequal: the earth might pass very close to the sun at one part\r\nof its orbit, and then recede to a very great distance at the opposite\r\npart. So far as the welfare of our globe and its inhabitants is\r\nconcerned, this is quite as important as the question of the mean\r\ndistance; too much heat in one half of the year would afford but\r\nindifferent compensation for too little during the other half. Lagrange\r\nsubmitted this question also to his analysis. Again he vanquished the\r\nmathematical difficulties, and again he was able to give assurance of\r\nthe permanence of our system. It is true that he was not this time able\r\nto say that the eccentricity of each path will remain constant; this is\r\nnot the case. What he does assert, and what he has abundantly proved, is\r\nthat the eccentricity of each orbit will always remain small. We learn\r\nthat the shape of the earth's orbit gradually swells and gradually\r\ncontracts; the greatest length of the ellipse is invariable, but\r\nsometimes it approaches more to a circle, and sometimes becomes more\r\nelliptical. These changes are comprised within narrow limits; so that,\r\nthough they may probably correspond with measurable climatic changes,\r\nyet the safety of the system is not imperilled, as it would be if the\r\neccentricity could increase indefinitely. Once again Lagrange applied\r\nthe resources of his calculus to study the effect which perturbations\r\ncan have on the inclination of the path in which the planet moves. The\r\nresult in this case was similar to that obtained with respect to the\r\neccentricities. If we commence with the assumption that the mutual\r\ninclinations of the planets are small, then mathematics assure us that\r\nthey must always remain small. We are thus led to the conclusion that\r\nthe planetary perturbations are unable to affect the stability of the\r\nsolar system.\r\n\r\nWe shall perhaps more fully appreciate the importance of these memorable\r\nresearches if we consider how easily matters might have been otherwise.\r\nLet us suppose a system resembling ours in every respect save one. Let\r\nthat system have a sun, as ours has; a system of planets and of\r\nsatellites like ours. Let the masses of all the bodies in this\r\nhypothetical system be identical with the masses in our system, and let\r\nthe distances and the periodic times be the same in the two cases. Let\r\nall the planes of the orbits be similarly placed; and yet this\r\nhypothetical system might contain seeds of decay from which ours is\r\nfree. There is one point in the imaginary scheme which we have not yet\r\nspecified. In our system all the planets revolve in the _same direction_\r\naround the sun. Let us suppose this law violated in the hypothetical\r\nsystem by reversing one planet on its path. That slight change alone\r\nwould expose the system to the risk of destruction by the planetary\r\nperturbations. Here, then, we find the necessity of that remarkable\r\nuniformity of the directions in which the planets revolve around the\r\nsun. Had these directions not been uniform, our system must, in all\r\nprobability, have perished ages ago, and we should not be here to\r\ndiscuss perturbations or any other subject.\r\n\r\nGreat as was the success of the eminent French mathematician who made\r\nthese beautiful discoveries, it was left for this century to witness the\r\ncrowning triumph of mathematical analysis applied to the law of\r\ngravitation. The work of Lagrange lacks the dramatic interest of the\r\ndiscovery made by Le Verrier and Adams, which gave still wider extent to\r\nthe solar system by the discovery of the planet Neptune revolving far\r\noutside Uranus.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the difficulties which were experienced when\r\nit was sought to reconcile the early observations of Uranus with those\r\nmade since its discovery. We have shown that the path in which this\r\nplanet revolved experienced change, and that consequently Uranus must be\r\nexposed to the action of some other force besides the sun's attraction.\r\n\r\nThe question arises as to the nature of these disturbing forces. From\r\nwhat we have already learned of the mutual deranging influence between\r\nany two planets, it seems natural to inquire whether the irregularities\r\nof Uranus could not be accounted for by the attraction of the other\r\nplanets. Uranus revolves just outside Saturn. The mass of Saturn is much\r\nlarger than the mass of Uranus. Could it not be that Saturn draws Uranus\r\naside, and thus causes the changes? This is a question to be decided by\r\nthe mathematician. He can compute what Saturn is able to do, and he\r\nfinds, no doubt, that Saturn is capable of producing some displacement\r\nof Uranus. In a similar manner Jupiter, with his mighty mass, acts on\r\nUranus, and produces a disturbance which the mathematician calculates.\r\nWhen the figures had been worked out for all the known planets they were\r\napplied to Uranus, and we might expect to find that they would fully\r\naccount for the observed irregularities of his path. This was, however,\r\nnot the case. After every known source of disturbance had been carefully\r\nallowed for, Uranus was still shown to be influenced by some further\r\nagent; and hence the conclusion was established that Uranus must be\r\naffected by some unknown body. What could this unknown body be, and\r\nwhere must it be situated? Analogy was here the guide of those who\r\nspeculated on this matter. We know no cause of disturbance of a planet's\r\nmotion except it be the attraction of another planet. Could it be that\r\nUranus was really attracted by some other planet at that time utterly\r\nunknown? This suggestion was made by many astronomers, and it was\r\npossible to determine some conditions which the unknown body should\r\nfulfil. In the first place its orbit must lie outside the orbit of\r\nUranus. This was necessary, because the unknown planet must be a large\r\nand massive one to produce the observed irregularities. If, therefore,\r\nit were nearer than Uranus, it would be a conspicuous object, and must\r\nhave been discovered long ago. Other reasonings were also available to\r\nshow that if the disturbances of Uranus were caused by the attraction of\r\na planet, that body must revolve outside the globe discovered by\r\nHerschel. The general analogies of the planetary system might also be\r\ninvoked in support of the hypothesis that the path of the unknown\r\nplanet, though necessarily elliptic, did not differ widely from a\r\ncircle, and that the plane in which it moved must also be nearly\r\ncoincident with the plane of the earth's orbit.\r\n\r\nThe measured deviations of Uranus at the different points of its orbit\r\nwere the sole data available for the discovery of the new planet. We\r\nhave to fit the orbit of the unknown globe, as well as the mass of the\r\nplanet itself, in such a way as to account for the various\r\nperturbations. Let us, for instance, assume a certain distance for the\r\nhypothetical body, and try if we can assign both an orbit and a mass for\r\nthe planet, at that distance, which shall account for the perturbations.\r\nOur first assumption is perhaps too great. We try again with a lesser\r\ndistance. We can now represent the observations with greater accuracy. A\r\nthird attempt will give the result still more closely, until at length\r\nthe distance of the unknown planet is determined. In a similar way the\r\nmass of the body can be also determined. We assume a certain value, and\r\ncalculate the perturbations. If the results seem greater than those\r\nobtained by observations, then the assumed mass is too great. We amend\r\nthe assumption, and recompute with a lesser amount, and so on until at\r\nlength we determine a mass for the planet which harmonises with the\r\nresults of actual measurement. The other elements of the unknown\r\norbit--its eccentricity and the position of its axis--are all to be\r\nascertained in a similar manner. At length it appeared that the\r\nperturbations of Uranus could be completely explained if the unknown\r\nplanet had a certain mass, and moved in an orbit which had a certain\r\nposition, while it was also manifest that no very different orbit or\r\ngreatly altered mass would explain the observed facts.\r\n\r\nThese remarkable computations were undertaken quite independently by two\r\nastronomers--one in England and one in France. Each of them attacked,\r\nand each of them succeeded in solving, the great problem. The scientific\r\nmen of England and the scientific men of France joined issue on the\r\nquestion as to the claims of their respective champions to the great\r\ndiscovery; but in the forty years which have elapsed since these\r\nmemorable researches the question has gradually become settled. It is\r\nthe impartial verdict of the scientific world outside England and\r\nFrance, that the merits of this splendid triumph of science must be\r\ndivided equally between the late distinguished Professor J.C. Adams, of\r\nCambridge, and the late U.J.J. Le Verrier, the director of the Paris\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\nShortly after Mr. Adams had taken his degree at Cambridge, in 1843, when\r\nhe obtained the distinction of Senior Wrangler, he turned his attention\r\nto the perturbations of Uranus, and, guided by these perturbations\r\nalone, commenced his search for the unknown planet. Long and arduous was\r\nthe enquiry--demanding an enormous amount of numerical calculation, as\r\nwell as consummate mathematical resource; but gradually Mr. Adams\r\novercame the difficulties. As the subject unfolded itself, he saw how\r\nthe perturbations of Uranus could be fully explained by the existence of\r\nan exterior planet, and at length he had ascertained, not alone the\r\norbit of this outer body, but he was even able to indicate the part of\r\nthe heavens in which the unknown globe must be sought. With his\r\nresearches in this advanced condition, Mr. Adams called on the\r\nAstronomer-Royal, Sir George Airy, at Greenwich, in October, 1845, and\r\nplaced in his hands the computations which indicated with marvellous\r\naccuracy the place of the yet unobserved planet. It thus appears that\r\nseven months before anyone else had solved this problem Mr. Adams had\r\nconquered its difficulties, and had actually located the planet in a\r\nposition but little more than a degree distant from the spot which it is\r\nnow known to have occupied. All that was wanted to complete the\r\ndiscovery, and to gain for Professor Adams and for English science the\r\nundivided glory of this achievement, was a strict telescopic search\r\nthrough the heavens in the neighbourhood indicated.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be said, was not such an enquiry instituted at once? No\r\ndoubt this would have been done, if the observatories had been generally\r\nfurnished forty years ago with those elaborate star-charts which they\r\nnow possess. In the absence of a chart (and none had yet been published\r\nof the part of the sky where the unknown planet was) the search for the\r\nplanet was a most tedious undertaking. It had been suggested that the\r\nnew globe could be detected by its visible disc; but it must be\r\nremembered that even Uranus, so much closer to us, had a disc so small\r\nthat it was observed nearly a score of times without particular notice,\r\nthough it did not escape the eagle glance of Herschel. There remained\r\nthen only one available method of finding Neptune. It was to construct a\r\nchart of the heavens in the neighbourhood indicated, and then to compare\r\nthis chart night after night with the stars in the heavens. Before\r\nrecommending the commencement of a labour so onerous, the\r\nAstronomer-Royal thought it right to submit Mr. Adams's researches to a\r\ncrucial preliminary test. Mr. Adams had shown how his theory rendered an\r\nexact account of the perturbations of Uranus in longitude. The\r\nAstronomer-Royal asked Mr. Adams whether he was able to give an equally\r\nclear explanation of the notable variations in the distance of Uranus.\r\nThere can be no doubt that his theory would have rendered a satisfactory\r\naccount of these variations also; but, unfortunately, Mr. Adams seems\r\nnot to have thought the matter of sufficient importance to give the\r\nAstronomer-Royal any speedy reply, and hence it happened that no less\r\nthan nine months elapsed between the time when Mr. Adams first\r\ncommunicated his results to the Astronomer-Royal and the time when the\r\ntelescopic search for the planet was systematically commenced. Up to\r\nthis time no account of Mr. Adams's researches had been published. His\r\nlabours were known to but few besides the Astronomer-Royal and Professor\r\nChallis of Cambridge, to whom the duty of making the search was\r\nafterwards entrusted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the attention of Le Verrier, the great French\r\nmathematician and astronomer, had been specially directed by Arago to\r\nthe problem of the perturbations of Uranus. With exhaustive analysis Le\r\nVerrier investigated every possible known source of disturbance. The\r\ninfluences of the older planets were estimated once more with every\r\nprecision, but only to confirm the conclusion already arrived at as to\r\ntheir inadequacy to account for the perturbations. Le Verrier then\r\ncommenced the search for the unknown planet by the aid of mathematical\r\ninvestigation, in complete ignorance of the labours of Adams. In\r\nNovember, 1845, and again on the 1st of June, 1846, portions of the\r\nFrench astronomer's results were announced. The Astronomer-Royal then\r\nperceived that his calculations coincided practically with those of\r\nAdams, insomuch that the places assigned to the unknown planet by the\r\ntwo astronomers were not more than a degree apart! This was, indeed, a\r\nremarkable result. Here was a planet unknown to human sight, yet felt,\r\nas it were, by mathematical analysis with a certainty so great that two\r\nastronomers, each in total ignorance of the other's labours, concurred\r\nin locating the planet in almost the same spot of the heavens. The\r\nexistence of the new globe was thus raised nearly to a certainty, and it\r\nbecame incumbent on practical astronomers to commence the search\r\nforthwith. In June, 1846, the Astronomer-Royal announced to the visitors\r\nof the Greenwich Observatory the close coincidence between the\r\ncalculations of Le Verrier and of Adams, and urged that a strict\r\nscrutiny of the region indicated should be at once instituted. Professor\r\nChallis, having the command of the great Northumberland equatorial\r\ntelescope at Cambridge, was induced to undertake the work, and on the\r\n29th July, 1846, he began his labours.\r\n\r\nThe plan of search adopted by Professor Challis was an onerous one. He\r\nfirst took the theoretical place of the planet, as given by Mr. Adams,\r\nand after allowing a very large margin for the uncertainties of a\r\ncalculation so recondite, he marked out a certain region of the heavens,\r\nnear the ecliptic, in which it might be anticipated that the unknown\r\nplanet must be found. He then determined to observe all the stars in\r\nthis region and measure their relative positions. When this work was\r\nonce done it was to be repeated a second time. His scheme even\r\ncontemplated a third complete set of observations of the stars contained\r\nwithin this selected region. There could be no doubt that this process\r\nwould determine the planet if it were bright enough to come within the\r\nlimits of stellar magnitude which Professor Challis adopted. The globe\r\nwould be detected by its motion relatively to the stars, when the three\r\nseries of measures came to be compared. The scheme was organised so\r\nthoroughly that it must have led to the expected discovery--in fact, it\r\nafterwards appeared that Professor Challis did actually observe the\r\nplanet more than once, and a subsequent comparison of its positions must\r\ninfallibly have led to the detection of the new globe.\r\n\r\nLe Verrier was steadily maturing his no less elaborate investigations in\r\nthe same direction. He felt confident of the existence of the planet,\r\nand he went so far as to predict not only the situation of the globe but\r\neven its actual appearance. He thought the planet would be large enough\r\n(though still of course only a telescopic object) to be distinguished\r\nfrom the stars by the possession of a disc. These definite predictions\r\nstrengthened the belief that we were on the verge of another great\r\ndiscovery in the solar system, so much so that when Sir John Herschel\r\naddressed the British Association on the 10th of September, 1846, he\r\nuttered the following words:--\"The past year has given to us the new\r\nplanet Astræa--it has done more, it has given us the probable prospect\r\nof another. We see it as Columbus saw America from the shores of Spain.\r\nIts movements have been felt trembling along the far-reaching line of\r\nour analysis, with a certainty hardly inferior to ocular demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nThe time of the discovery was now rapidly approaching. On the 18th of\r\nSeptember, 1846, Le Verrier wrote to Dr. Galle of the Berlin\r\nObservatory, describing the place of the planet indicated by his\r\ncalculations, and asking him to make its telescopic discovery. The\r\nrequest thus preferred was similar to that made on behalf of Adams to\r\nProfessor Challis. Both at Berlin and at Cambridge the telescopic\r\nresearch was to be made in the same region of the heavens. The Berlin\r\nastronomers were, however, fortunate in possessing an invaluable aid to\r\nthe research which was not at the time in the hands of Professor\r\nChallis. We have mentioned how the search for a telescopic planet can be\r\nfacilitated by the use of a carefully-executed chart of the stars. In\r\nfact, a mere comparison of the chart with the sky is all that is\r\nnecessary. It happened that the preparation of a series of star charts\r\nhad been undertaken by the Berlin Academy of Sciences some years\r\npreviously. On these charts the place of every star, down even to the\r\ntenth magnitude, had been faithfully engraved. This work was one of much\r\nutility, but its originators could hardly have anticipated the brilliant\r\ndiscovery which would arise from their years of tedious labour. It was\r\nfound convenient to publish such an extensive piece of surveying work by\r\ninstalments, and accordingly, as the chart was completed, it issued from\r\nthe press sheet by sheet. It happened that just before the news of Le\r\nVerrier's labours reached Berlin the chart of that part of the heavens\r\nhad been engraved and printed.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 23rd of September that Le Verrier's letter reached Dr.\r\nGalle at Berlin. The sky that night was clear, and we can imagine with\r\nwhat anxiety Dr. Galle directed his telescope to the heavens. The\r\ninstrument was pointed in accordance with Le Verrier's instructions. The\r\nfield of view showed a multitude of stars, as does every part of the\r\nheavens. One of these was really the planet. The new chart was unrolled,\r\nand, star by star, the heavens were compared with it. As the\r\nidentification of the stars went on, one object after another was found\r\nto lie in the heavens as it was engraved on the chart, and was of course\r\nrejected. At length a star of the eighth magnitude--a brilliant\r\nobject--was brought into review. The chart was examined, but there was\r\nno star there. This object could not have been in its present place when\r\nthe chart was formed. The object was therefore a wanderer--a planet. Yet\r\nit was necessary to be cautious in such a matter. Many possibilities had\r\nto be guarded against. It was, for instance, at least conceivable that\r\nthe object was really a star which, by some mischance, eluded the\r\ncareful eye of the astronomer who had constructed the map. It was even\r\npossible that the star might be one of the large class of variables\r\nwhich alternate in brightness, and it might have been too faint to have\r\nbeen visible when the chart was made. Or it might be one of the minor\r\nplanets moving between Mars and Jupiter. Even if none of these\r\nexplanations would answer, it was still necessary to show that the\r\nobject was moving with that particular velocity and in that particular\r\ndirection which the theory of Le Verrier indicated. The lapse of a\r\nsingle day was sufficient to dissipate all doubts. The next night the\r\nobject was again observed. It had moved, and when its motion was\r\nmeasured it was found to accord precisely with what Le Verrier had\r\nforetold. Indeed, as if no circumstance in the confirmation should be\r\nwanting, the diameter of the planet, as measured by the micrometers at\r\nBerlin, proved to be practically coincident with that anticipated by Le\r\nVerrier.\r\n\r\nThe world speedily rang with the news of this splendid achievement.\r\nInstantly the name of Le Verrier rose to a pinnacle hardly surpassed by\r\nthat of any astronomer of any age or country. The circumstances of the\r\ndiscovery were highly dramatic. We picture the great astronomer buried\r\nin profound meditation for many months; his eyes are bent, not on the\r\nstars, but on his calculations. No telescope is in his hand; the human\r\nintellect is the instrument he alone uses. With patient labour, guided\r\nby consummate mathematical artifice, he manipulates his columns of\r\nfigures. He attempts one solution after another. In each he learns\r\nsomething to avoid; by each he obtains some light to guide him in his\r\nfuture labours. At length he begins to see harmony in those results\r\nwhere before there was but discord. Gradually the clouds disperse, and\r\nhe discerns with a certainty little short of actual vision the planet\r\nglittering in the far depths of space. He rises from his desk and\r\ninvokes the aid of a practical astronomer; and lo! there is the planet\r\nin the indicated spot. The annals of science present no such spectacle\r\nas this. It was the most triumphant proof of the law of universal\r\ngravitation. The Newtonian theory had indeed long ere this attained an\r\nimpregnable position; but, as if to place its truth in the most\r\nconspicuous light, this discovery of Neptune was accomplished.\r\n\r\nFor a moment it seemed as if the French were to enjoy the undivided\r\nhonour of this splendid triumph; nor would it, indeed, have been\r\nunfitting that the nation which gave birth to Lagrange and to Laplace,\r\nand which developed the great Newtonian theory by their immortal\r\nlabours, should have obtained this distinction. Up to the time of the\r\ntelescopic discovery of the planet by Dr. Galle at Berlin, no public\r\nannouncement had been made of the labours of Challis in searching for\r\nthe planet, nor even of the theoretical researches of Adams on which\r\nthose observations were based. But in the midst of the pæans of triumph\r\nwith which the enthusiastic French nation hailed the discovery of Le\r\nVerrier, there appeared a letter from Sir John Herschel in the\r\n_Athenæum_ for 3rd October, 1846, in which he announced the researches\r\nmade by Adams, and claimed for him a participation in the glory of the\r\ndiscovery. Subsequent enquiry has shown that this claim was a just one,\r\nand it is now universally admitted by all independent authorities. Yet\r\nit will easily be imagined that the French _savants_, jealous of the\r\nfame of their countryman, could not at first be brought to recognise a\r\nclaim so put forward. They were asked to divide the unparalleled honour\r\nbetween their own illustrious countryman and a young foreigner of whom\r\nbut few had ever heard, and who had not even published a line of his\r\nwork, nor had any claim been made on his part until after the work had\r\nbeen completely finished by Le Verrier. The demand made on behalf of\r\nAdams was accordingly refused any acknowledgment in France; and an\r\nembittered controversy was the consequence. Point by point the English\r\nastronomers succeeded in establishing the claim of their countryman. It\r\nwas true that Adams had not published his researches to the world, but\r\nhe had communicated them to the Astronomer-Royal, the official head of\r\nthe science in this country. They were also well known to Professor\r\nChallis, the Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge. Then, too, the work of\r\nAdams was published, and it was found to be quite as thorough and quite\r\nas successful as that of Le Verrier. It was also found that the method\r\nof search adopted by Professor Challis not only must have been\r\neventually successful, but that it actually was in a sense already\r\nsuccessful. When the telescopic discovery of the planet had been\r\nachieved, Challis turned naturally to see whether he had observed the\r\nnew globe also. It was on the 1st October that he heard of the success\r\nof Dr. Galle, and by that time Challis had accumulated observations in\r\nconnection with this research of no fewer than 3,150 stars. Among them\r\nhe speedily found that an object observed on the 12th of August was not\r\nin the same place on the 30th of July. This was really the planet; and\r\nits discovery would thus have been assured had Challis had time to\r\ncompare his measurements. In fact, if he had only discussed his\r\nobservations at once, there cannot be much doubt that the entire glory\r\nof the discovery would have been awarded to Adams. He would then have\r\nbeen first, no less in the theoretical calculations than in the optical\r\nverification of the planet's existence. It may also be remarked that\r\nChallis narrowly missed making the discovery of Neptune in another way.\r\nLe Verrier had pointed out in his paper the possibility of detecting the\r\nsought-for globe by its disc. Challis made the attempt, and before the\r\nintelligence of the actual discovery at Berlin had reached him he had\r\nmade an examination of the region indicated by Le Verrier. About 300\r\nstars passed through the field of view, and among them he selected one\r\non account of its disc; it afterwards appeared that this was indeed the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nIf the researches of Le Verrier and of Adams had never been undertaken\r\nit is certain that the distant Neptune must have been some time\r\ndiscovered; yet that might have been made in a manner which every true\r\nlover of science would now deplore. We hear constantly that new minor\r\nplanets are observed, yet no one attaches to such achievements a\r\nfraction of the consequence belonging to the discovery of Neptune. The\r\ndanger was, that Neptune should have been merely dropped upon by simple\r\nsurvey work, just as Uranus was discovered, or just as the hosts of\r\nminor planets are now found. In this case Theoretical Astronomy, the\r\ngreat science founded by Newton, would have been deprived of its most\r\nbrilliant illustration.\r\n\r\nNeptune had, in fact, a very narrow escape on at least one previous\r\noccasion of being discovered in a very simple way. This was shown when\r\nsufficient observations had been collected to enable the path of the\r\nplanet to be calculated. It was then possible to trace back the\r\nmovements of the planet among the stars and thus to institute a search\r\nin the catalogues of earlier astronomers to see whether they contained\r\nany record of Neptune, erroneously noted as a star. Several such\r\ninstances have been discovered. I shall, however, only refer to one,\r\nwhich possesses a singular interest. It was found that the place of the\r\nplanet on May 10th, 1795, must have coincided with that of a so-called\r\nstar recorded on that day in the \"Histoire Céleste\" of Lalande. By\r\nactual examination of the heavens it further appeared that there was no\r\nstar in the place indicated by Lalande, so the fact that here was\r\nreally an observation of Neptune was placed quite beyond doubt. When\r\nreference was made to the original manuscripts of Lalande, a matter of\r\ngreat interest was brought to light. It was there found that he had\r\nobserved the same star (for so he regarded it) both on May 8th and on\r\nMay 10th; on each day he had determined its position, and both\r\nobservations are duly recorded. But when he came to prepare his\r\ncatalogue and found that the places on the two occasions were different,\r\nhe discarded the earlier result, and merely printed the latter.\r\n\r\nHad Lalande possessed a proper confidence in his own observations, an\r\nimmortal discovery lay in his grasp; had he manfully said, \"I was right\r\non the 10th of May and I was right on the 8th of May; I made no mistake\r\non either occasion, and the object I saw on the 8th must have moved\r\nbetween that and the 10th,\" then he must without fail have found\r\nNeptune. But had he done so, how lamentable would have been the loss to\r\nscience! The discovery of Neptune would then merely have been an\r\naccidental reward to a laborious worker, instead of being one of the\r\nmost glorious achievements in the loftiest department of human reason.\r\n\r\nBesides this brief sketch of the discovery of Neptune, we have but\r\nlittle to tell with regard to this distant planet. If we fail to see in\r\nUranus any of those features which make Mars or Venus, Jupiter or\r\nSaturn, such attractive telescopic objects, what can we expect to find\r\nin Neptune, which is half as far again as Uranus? With a good telescope\r\nand a suitable magnifying power we can indeed see that Neptune has a\r\ndisc, but no features on that disc can be identified. We are\r\nconsequently not in a position to ascertain the period in which Neptune\r\nrotates around its axis, though from the general analogy of the system\r\nwe must feel assured that it really does rotate. More successful have\r\nbeen the attempts to measure the diameter of Neptune, which is found to\r\nbe about 35,000 miles, or more than four times the diameter of the\r\nearth. It would also seem that, like Jupiter and like Saturn, the planet\r\nmust be enveloped with a vast cloud-laden atmosphere, for the mean\r\ndensity of the globe is only about one-fifth that of the earth. This\r\ngreat globe revolves around the sun at a mean distance of no less than\r\n2,800 millions of miles, which is about thirty times as great as the\r\nmean distance from the earth to the sun. The journey, though\r\naccomplished at the rate of more than three miles a second, is yet so\r\nlong that Neptune requires almost 165 years to complete one revolution.\r\nSince its discovery, some fifty years ago, Neptune has moved through\r\nabout one-third of its path, and even since the date when it was first\r\ncasually seen by Lalande, in 1795, it has only had time to traverse\r\nthree-fifths of its mighty circuit.\r\n\r\nNeptune, like our earth, is attended by a single satellite; this\r\ndelicate object was discovered by Mr. Lassell with his two-foot\r\nreflecting telescope shortly after the planet itself became known. The\r\nmotion of the satellite of Neptune is nearly circular. Its orbit is\r\ninclined at an angle of about 35° to the Ecliptic, and it is specially\r\nnoteworthy that, like the satellites of Uranus, the direction of the\r\nmotion runs counter to the planetary movements generally. The satellite\r\nperforms its journey around Neptune in a period of a little less than\r\nsix days. By observing the motions of this moon we are enabled to\r\ndetermine the mass of the planet, and thus it appears that the weight of\r\nNeptune is about one nineteen-thousandth part of that of the sun.\r\n\r\nNo planets beyond Neptune have been seen, nor is there at present any\r\ngood ground for believing in their existence as visual objects. In the\r\nchapter on the minor planets I have entered into a discussion of the way\r\nin which these objects are discovered. It is by minute and diligent\r\ncomparison of the heavens with elaborate star charts that these bodies\r\nare brought to light. Such enquiries would be equally efficacious in\r\nsearching for an ultra-Neptunian planet; in fact, we could design no\r\nbetter method to seek for such a body, if it existed, than that which is\r\nat this moment in constant practice at many observatories. The labours\r\nof those who search for small planets have been abundantly rewarded with\r\ndiscoveries now counted by hundreds. Yet it is a noteworthy fact that\r\nall these planets are limited to one region of the solar system. It has\r\nsometimes been conjectured that time may disclose perturbations in the\r\norbit of Neptune, and that these perturbations may lead to the discovery\r\nof a planet still more remote, even though that planet be so distant and\r\nso faint that it eludes all telescopic research. At present, however,\r\nsuch an enquiry can hardly come within the range of practical astronomy.\r\nIts movements have no doubt been studied minutely, but it must describe\r\na larger part of its orbit before it would be feasible to conclude, from\r\nthe perturbations of its path, the existence of an unknown and still\r\nmore remote planet.\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen that the planetary system is bounded on one side by\r\nMercury and on the other by Neptune. The discovery of Mercury was an\r\nachievement of prehistoric times. The early astronomer who accomplished\r\nthat feat, when devoid of instrumental assistance and unsupported by\r\naccurate theoretical knowledge, merits our hearty admiration for his\r\nuntutored acuteness and penetration. On the other hand, the discovery of\r\nthe exterior boundary of the planetary system is worthy of special\r\nattention from the fact that it was founded solely on profound\r\ntheoretical learning.\r\n\r\nThough we here close our account of the planets and their satellites, we\r\nhave still two chapters to add before we shall have completed what is to\r\nbe said with regard to the solar system. A further and notable class of\r\nbodies, neither planets nor satellites, own allegiance to the sun, and\r\nrevolve round him in conformity with the laws of universal gravitation.\r\nThese bodies are the comets, and their somewhat more humble associates,\r\nthe shooting stars. We find in the study of these objects many matters\r\nof interest, which we shall discuss in the ensuing chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCOMETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Comets contrasted with Planets in Nature as well as in their\r\n     Movements--Coggia's Comet--Periodic Returns--The Law of\r\n     Gravitation--Parabolic and Elliptic Orbits--Theory in Advance of\r\n     Observations--Most Cometary Orbits are sensibly Parabolic--The\r\n     Labours of Halley--The Comet of 1682--Halley's Memorable\r\n     Prediction--The Retardation produced by Disturbance--Successive\r\n     Returns of Halley's Comet--Encke's Comet--Effect of\r\n     Perturbations--Orbit of Encke's Comet--Attraction of Mercury and of\r\n     Jupiter--How the Identity of the Comet is secured--How to weigh\r\n     Mercury--Distance from the Earth to the Sun found by Encke's\r\n     Comet--The Disturbing Medium--Remarkable Comets--Spectrum of a\r\n     Comet--Passage of a Comet between the Earth and the Stars--Can the\r\n     Comet be weighed?--Evidence of the Small Mass of the Comet derived\r\n     from the Theory of Perturbation--The Tail of the Comet--Its\r\n     Changes--Views as to its Nature--Carbon present in Comets--Origin\r\n     of Periodic Comets.\r\n\r\nIn our previous chapters, which treated of the sun and the moon, the\r\nplanets and their satellites, we found in all cases that the celestial\r\nbodies with which we were concerned were nearly globular in form, and\r\nmany are undoubtedly of solid substance. All these objects possess a\r\ndensity which, even if in some cases it be much less than that of the\r\nearth, is still hundreds of times greater than the density of merely\r\ngaseous materials. We now, however, approach the consideration of a\r\nclass of objects of a widely different character. We have no longer to\r\ndeal with globular objects possessing considerable mass. Comets are of\r\naltogether irregular shape; they are in large part, at all events,\r\nformed of materials in the utmost state of tenuity, and their masses are\r\nso small that no means we possess have enabled them to be measured. Not\r\nonly are comets different in constitution from planets or from the other\r\nmore solid bodies of our system, but the movements of such bodies are\r\nquite distinct from the orderly return of the planets at their appointed\r\nseasons. The comets appear sometimes with almost startling\r\nunexpectedness; they rapidly swell in size to an extent that in\r\nsuperstitious ages called forth the utmost terror; presently they\r\ndisappear, in many cases never again to return. Modern science has, no\r\ndoubt, removed a great deal of the mystery which once invested the whole\r\nsubject of comets. Their movements are now to a large extent explained,\r\nand some additions have been made to our knowledge of their nature,\r\nthough we must still confess that what we do know bears but a very small\r\nproportion to what remains unknown.\r\n\r\nLet me first describe in general terms the nature of a comet, in so far\r\nas its structure is disclosed by the aid of a powerful refracting\r\ntelescope. We represent in Plate XII. two interesting sketches made at\r\nHarvard College Observatory of the great comet of 1874, distinguished by\r\nthe name of its discoverer Coggia.\r\n\r\nWe see here the head of the comet, containing as its brightest spot what\r\nis called the nucleus, and in which the material of the comet seems to\r\nbe much denser than elsewhere. Surrounding the nucleus we find certain\r\ndefinite layers of luminous material, the coma, or head, from 20,000 to\r\n1,000,000 miles in diameter, from which the tail seems to stream away.\r\nThis view may be regarded as that of a typical object of this class, but\r\nthe varieties of structure presented by different comets are almost\r\ninnumerable. In some cases we find the nucleus absent; in other cases we\r\nfind the tail to be wanting. The tail is, no doubt, a conspicuous\r\nfeature in those great comets which receive universal attention; but in\r\nthe small telescopic objects, of which a few are generally found every\r\nyear, this feature is usually absent. Not only do comets present great\r\nvarieties in appearance, but even the aspect of a single object\r\nundergoes great change. The comet will sometimes increase enormously in\r\nbulk; sometimes it will diminish; sometimes it will have a large tail,\r\nor sometimes no tail at all. Measurements of a comet's size are almost\r\nfutile; they may cease to be true even during the few hours in which a\r\ncomet is observed in the course of a night. It is, in fact, impossible\r\nto identify a comet by any description of its personal appearance. Yet\r\nthe question as to identity of a comet is often of very great\r\nconsequence. We must provide means by which it can be established,\r\nentirely apart from what the comet may look like.\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that several of these bodies make periodic returns.\r\nAfter having been invisible for a certain number of years, a comet comes\r\ninto view, and again retreats into space to perform another revolution.\r\nThe question then arises as to how we are to recognise the body when it\r\ndoes come back? The personal features of its size or brightness, the\r\npresence or absence of a tail, large or small, are fleeting characters\r\nof no value for such a purpose. Fortunately, however, the law of\r\nelliptic motion established by Kepler has suggested the means of\r\ndefining the identity of a comet with absolute precision.\r\n\r\nAfter Newton had made his discovery of the law of gravitation, and\r\nsucceeded in demonstrating that the elliptic paths of the planets around\r\nthe sun were necessary consequences of that law, he was naturally\r\ntempted to apply the same reasoning to explain the movements of comets.\r\nHere, again, he met with marvellous success, and illustrated his theory\r\nby completely explaining the movements of the remarkable body which was\r\nvisible from December, 1680, to March, 1681.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--The Parabolic Path of a Comet.]\r\n\r\nThere is a certain beautiful curve known to geometricians by the name of\r\nthe parabola. Its form is shown in the adjoining figure; it is a curved\r\nline which bends in towards and around a certain point known as the\r\nfocus. This would not be the occasion for any allusion to the\r\ngeometrical properties of this curve; they should be sought in works on\r\nmathematics. It will here be only necessary to point to the connection\r\nwhich exists between the parabola and the ellipse. In a former chapter\r\nwe have explained the construction of the latter curve, and we have\r\nshown how it possesses two foci. Let us suppose that a series of\r\nellipses are drawn, each of which has a greater distance between its\r\nfoci than the preceding one. Imagine the process carried on until at\r\nlength the distance between the foci became enormously great in\r\ncomparison with the distance from each focus to the curve, then each end\r\nof this long ellipse will practically have the same form as a parabola.\r\nWe may thus look on the latter curve represented in Fig. 69 as being one\r\nend of an ellipse of which the other end is at an indefinitely great\r\ndistance. In 1681 Doerfel, a clergyman of Saxony, proved that the great\r\ncomet then recently observed moved in a parabola, in the focus of which\r\nthe sun was situated. Newton showed that the law of gravitation would\r\npermit a body to move in an ellipse of this very extreme type no less\r\nthan in one of the more ordinary proportions. An object revolving in a\r\nparabolic orbit about the sun at the focus moves in gradually towards\r\nthe sun, sweeps around the great luminary, and then begins to retreat.\r\nThere is a necessary distinction between parabolic and elliptic motion.\r\nIn the latter case the body, after its retreat to a certain distance,\r\nwill turn round and again draw in towards the sun; in fact, it must make\r\nperiodic circuits of its orbit, as the planets are found to do. But in\r\nthe case of the true parabola the body can never return; to do so it\r\nwould have to double the distant focus, and as that is infinitely\r\nremote, it could not be reached except in the lapse of infinite time.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of the movement in a parabola may be thus\r\ndescribed. The body draws in gradually towards the focus from an\r\nindefinitely remote distance on one side, and after passing round the\r\nfocus gradually recedes to an indefinitely remote distance on the other\r\nside, never again to return. When Newton had perceived that parabolic\r\nmotion of this type could arise from the law of gravitation, it at once\r\noccurred to him (independently of Doerfel's discovery, of which he was\r\nnot aware) that by its means the movements of a comet might be\r\nexplained. He knew that comets must be attracted by the sun; he saw that\r\nthe usual course of a comet was to appear suddenly, to sweep around the\r\nsun and then retreat, never again to return. Was this really a case of\r\nparabolic motion? Fortunately, the materials for the trial of this\r\nimportant suggestion were ready to his hand. He was able to avail\r\nhimself of the known movements of the comet of 1680, and of observations\r\nof several other bodies of the same nature which had been collected by\r\nthe diligence of astronomers. With his usual sagacity, Newton devised a\r\nmethod by which, from the known facts, the path which the comet pursues\r\ncould be determined. He found that it was a parabola, and that the\r\nvelocity of the comet was governed by the law that the straight line\r\nfrom the sun to the comet swept over equal areas in equal times. Here\r\nwas another confirmation of the law of universal gravitation. In this\r\ncase, indeed, the theory may be said to have been actually in advance of\r\ncalculation. Kepler had determined from observation that the paths of\r\nthe planets were ellipses, and Newton had shown how this fact was a\r\nconsequence of the law of gravitation. But in the case of the comets\r\ntheir highly erratic orbits had never been reduced to geometrical form\r\nuntil the theory of Newton showed him that they were parabolic, and then\r\nhe invoked observation to verify the anticipations of his theory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nCOGGIA'S COMET.\r\n\r\n(AS SEEN ON JUNE 10TH AND JULY 9TH, 1874.)]\r\n\r\nThe great majority of comets move in orbits which cannot be sensibly\r\ndiscriminated from parabolæ, and any body whose orbit is of this\r\ncharacter can only be seen at a single apparition. The theory of\r\ngravitation, though it admits the parabola as a possible orbit for a\r\ncomet, does not assert that the path must necessarily be of this type.\r\nWe have pointed out that this curve is only a very extreme type of\r\nellipse, and it would still be in perfect accordance with the law of\r\ngravitation for a comet to pursue a path of any elliptical form,\r\nprovided that the sun was placed at the focus, and that the comet obeyed\r\nthe rule of describing equal areas in equal times. If a body move in an\r\nelliptic path, then it will return to the sun again, and consequently we\r\nshall have periodical visits from the same object.\r\n\r\nAn interesting field of enquiry was here presented to the astronomer.\r\nNor was it long before the discovery of a periodic comet was made which\r\nillustrated, in a striking manner, the soundness of the anticipation\r\njust expressed. The name of the celebrated astronomer Halley is,\r\nperhaps, best known from its association with the great comet whose\r\nperiodicity was discovered by his calculations. When Halley learned from\r\nthe Newtonian theory the possibility that a comet might move in an\r\nelliptic orbit, he undertook a most laborious investigation; he\r\ncollected from various records of observed comets all the reliable\r\nparticulars that could be obtained, and thus he was enabled to\r\nascertain, with tolerable accuracy, the nature of the paths pursued by\r\nabout twenty-four large comets. One of these was the great body of 1682,\r\nwhich Halley himself observed, and whose path he computed in accordance\r\nwith the principles of Newton. Halley then proceeded to investigate\r\nwhether this comet of 1682 could have visited our system at any previous\r\nepoch. To answer this question he turned to the list of recorded comets\r\nwhich he had so carefully compiled, and he found that his comet very\r\nclosely resembled, both in appearance and in orbit, a comet observed in\r\n1607, and also another observed in 1531. Could these three bodies be\r\nidentical? It was only necessary to suppose that a comet, instead of\r\nrevolving in a parabolic orbit, really revolved in an extremely\r\nelongated ellipse, and that it completed each revolution in a period of\r\nabout seventy-five or seventy-six years. He submitted this hypothesis to\r\nevery test that he could devise; he found that the orbits, determined on\r\neach of the three occasions, were so nearly identical that it would be\r\ncontrary to all probability that the coincidence should be accidental.\r\nAccordingly, he decided to submit his theory to the most supreme test\r\nknown to astronomy. He ventured to make a prediction which posterity\r\nwould have the opportunity of verifying. If the period of the comet were\r\nseventy-five or seventy-six years, as the former observations seemed to\r\nshow, then Halley estimated that, if unmolested, it ought to return in\r\n1757 or 1758. There were, however, certain sources of disturbance which\r\nhe pointed out, and which would be quite powerful enough to affect\r\nmaterially the time of return. The comet in its journey passes near the\r\npath of Jupiter, and experiences great perturbations from that mighty\r\nplanet. Halley concluded that the expected return might be accordingly\r\ndelayed till the end of 1758 or the beginning of 1759.\r\n\r\nThis prediction was a memorable event in the history of astronomy,\r\ninasmuch as it was the first attempt to foretell the apparition of one\r\nof those mysterious bodies whose visits seemed guided by no fixed law,\r\nand which were usually regarded as omens of awful import. Halley felt\r\nthe importance of his announcement. He knew that his earthly course\r\nwould have run long before the comet had completed its revolution; and,\r\nin language almost touching, the great astronomer writes: \"Wherefore if\r\nit should return according to our prediction about the year 1758,\r\nimpartial posterity will not refuse to acknowledge that this was first\r\ndiscovered by an Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nAs the time drew near when this great event was expected, it awakened\r\nthe liveliest interest among astronomers. The distinguished\r\nmathematician Clairaut undertook to compute anew, by the aid of improved\r\nmethods, the effect which would be wrought on the comet by the\r\nattraction of the planets. His analysis of the perturbations was\r\nsufficient to show that the object would be kept back for 100 days by\r\nSaturn, and for 518 days by Jupiter. He therefore gave some additional\r\nexactness to the prediction of Halley, and finally concluded that this\r\ncomet would reach the perihelion, or the point of its path nearest to\r\nthe sun, about the middle of April, 1759. The sagacious astronomer (who,\r\nwe must remember, lived long before the discovery of Uranus and of\r\nNeptune) further adds that as this body retreats so far, it may possibly\r\nbe subject to influences of which we do not know, or to the disturbance\r\neven of some planet too remote to be ever perceived. He, accordingly,\r\nqualified his prediction with the statement that, owing to these unknown\r\npossibilities, his calculations might be a month wrong one way or the\r\nother. Clairaut made this memorable communication to the Academy of\r\nSciences on the 14th of November, 1758. The attention of astronomers was\r\nimmediately quickened to see whether the visitor, who last appeared\r\nseventy-six years previously, was about to return. Night after night the\r\nheavens were scanned. On Christmas Day in 1758 the comet was first\r\ndetected, and it passed closest to the sun about midnight on the 12th of\r\nMarch, just a month earlier than the time announced by Clairaut, but\r\nstill within the limits of error which he had assigned as being\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe verification of this prediction was a further confirmation of the\r\ntheory of gravitation. Since then, Halley's comet has returned once\r\nagain, in 1835, in circumstances somewhat similar to those just\r\nnarrated. Further historical research has also succeeded in identifying\r\nHalley's comet with numerous memorable apparitions of comets in former\r\ntimes. It has even been shown that a splendid object, which appeared\r\neleven years before the commencement of the Christian era, was merely\r\nHalley's comet in one of its former returns. Among the most celebrated\r\nvisits of this body was that of 1066, when the apparition attracted\r\nuniversal attention. A picture of the comet on this occasion forms a\r\nquaint feature in the Bayeux Tapestry. The next return of Halley's comet\r\nis expected about the year 1910.\r\n\r\nThere are now several comets known which revolve in elliptic paths, and\r\nare, accordingly, entitled to be termed periodic. These objects are\r\nchiefly telescopic, and are thus in strong contrast to the splendid\r\ncomet of Halley. Most of the other periodic comets have periods much\r\nshorter than that of Halley. Of these objects, by far the most\r\ncelebrated is that known as Encke's comet, which merits our careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe object to which we refer has had a striking career during which it\r\nhas provided many illustrations of the law of gravitation. We are not\r\nhere concerned with the prosaic routine of a mere planetary orbit. A\r\nplanet is mainly subordinated to the compelling sway of the sun's\r\ngravitation. It is also to some slight extent affected by the\r\nattractions which it experiences from the other planets. Mathematicians\r\nhave long been accustomed to anticipate the movements of these globes by\r\nactual calculation. They know how the place of the planet is\r\napproximately decided by the sun's attraction, and they can discriminate\r\nthe different adjustments which that place is to receive in consequence\r\nof the disturbances produced by the other planets. The capabilities of\r\nthe planets for producing disturbance are greatly increased when the\r\ndisturbed body follows the eccentric path of a comet. It is frequently\r\nfound that the path of such a body comes very near the track of a\r\nplanet, so that the comet may actually sweep by the planet itself, even\r\nif the two bodies do not actually run into collision. On such an\r\noccasion the disturbing effect is enormously augmented, and we therefore\r\nturn to the comets when we desire to illustrate the theory of planetary\r\nperturbations by some striking example.\r\n\r\nHaving decided to choose a comet, the next question is, _What_ comet?\r\nThere cannot here be much room for hesitation. Those splendid comets\r\nwhich appear so capriciously may be at once excluded. They are visitors\r\napparently coming for the first time, and retreating without any\r\ndistinct promise that mankind shall ever see them again. A comet of this\r\nkind moves in a parabolic path, sweeps once around the sun, and thence\r\nretreats into the space whence it came. We cannot study the effect of\r\nperturbations on a comet completely until it has been watched during\r\nsuccessive returns to the sun. Our choice is thus limited to the\r\ncomparatively small class of objects known as periodic comets; and, from\r\na survey of the entire group, we select the most suitable to our\r\npurpose. It is the object generally known as Encke's comet, for, though\r\nEncke was not the discoverer, yet it is to his calculations that the\r\ncomet owes its fame. This body is rendered more suitable for our purpose\r\nby the researches to which it has recently given rise.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1818 a comet was discovered by the painstaking astronomer\r\nPons at Marseilles. We are not to imagine that this body produced a\r\nsplendid spectacle. It was a small telescopic object, not unlike one of\r\nthose dim nebulæ which are scattered in thousands over the heavens. The\r\ncomet is, however, readily distinguished from a nebula by its movement\r\nrelatively to the stars, while the nebula remains at rest for centuries.\r\nThe position of this comet was ascertained by its discoverer, as well as\r\nby other astronomers. Encke found from the observations that the comet\r\nreturned to the sun once in every three years and a few months. This was\r\na startling announcement. At that time no other comet of short period\r\nhad been detected, so that this new addition to the solar system\r\nawakened the liveliest interest. The question was immediately raised as\r\nto whether this comet, which revolved so frequently, might not have been\r\nobserved during previous returns. The historical records of the\r\napparitions of comets are counted by hundreds, and how among this host\r\nare we to select those objects which were identical with the comet\r\ndiscovered by Pons?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--The Orbit of Encke's Comet.]\r\n\r\nWe may at once relinquish any hope of identification from drawings of\r\nthe object, but, fortunately, there is one feature of a comet on which\r\nwe can seize, and which no fluctuations of the actual structure can\r\nmodify or disguise. The path in which the body travels through space is\r\nindependent of the bodily changes in its structure. The shape of that\r\npath and its position depend entirely upon those other bodies of the\r\nsolar system which are specially involved in the theory of Encke's\r\ncomet. In Fig. 70 we show the orbits of three of the planets. They have\r\nbeen chosen with such proportions as shall make the innermost represent\r\nthe orbit of Mercury; the next is the orbit of the earth, while the\r\noutermost is the orbit of Jupiter. Besides these three we perceive in\r\nthe figure a much more elliptical path, representing the orbit of\r\nEncke's comet, projected down on the plane of the earth's motion. The\r\nsun is situated at the focus of the ellipse. The comet is constrained to\r\nrevolve in this curve by the attraction of the sun, and it requires a\r\nlittle more than three years to accomplish a complete revolution. It\r\npasses close to the sun at perihelion, at a point inside the path of\r\nMercury, while at its greatest distance it approaches the path of\r\nJupiter. This elliptic orbit is mainly determined by the attraction of\r\nthe sun. Whether the comet weighed an ounce, a ton, a thousand tons, or\r\na million tons, whether it was a few miles, or many thousands of miles\r\nin diameter, the orbit would still be the same. It is by the shape of\r\nthis ellipse, by its actual size, and by the position in which it lies,\r\nthat we identify the comet. It had been observed in 1786, 1795, and\r\n1805, but on these occasions it had not been noticed that the comet's\r\npath deviated from the parabola.\r\n\r\nEncke's comet is usually so faint that even the most powerful telescope\r\nin the world would not show a trace of it. After one of its periodical\r\nvisits, the body withdraws until it recedes to the outermost part of its\r\npath, then it will turn, and again approach the sun. It would seem that\r\nit becomes invigorated by the sun's rays, and commences to dilate under\r\ntheir genial influence. While moving in this part of its path the comet\r\nlessens its distance from the earth. It daily increases in splendour,\r\nuntil at length, partly by the intrinsic increase in brightness and\r\npartly by the decrease in distance from the earth, it comes within the\r\nrange of our telescopes. We can generally anticipate when this will\r\noccur, and we can tell to what point of the heavens the telescope is to\r\nbe pointed so as to discern the comet at its next return to perihelion.\r\nThe comet cannot elude the grasp of the mathematician. He can tell when\r\nand where the comet is to be found, but no one can say what it will be\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nWere all the other bodies of the system removed, then the path of\r\nEncke's comet must be for ever performed in the same ellipse and with\r\nabsolute regularity. The chief interest for our present purpose lies not\r\nin the regularity of its path, but in the _irregularities_ introduced\r\ninto that path by the presence of the other bodies of the solar system.\r\nLet us, for instance, follow the progress of the comet through its\r\nperihelion passage, in which the track lies near that of the planet\r\nMercury. It will usually happen that Mercury is situated in a distant\r\npart of its path at the moment the comet is passing, and the influence\r\nof the planet will then be comparatively small. It may, however,\r\nsometimes happen that the planet and the comet come close together. One\r\nof the most interesting instances of a close approach to Mercury took\r\nplace on the 22nd November, 1848. On that day the comet and the planet\r\nwere only separated by an interval of about one-thirtieth of the earth's\r\ndistance from the sun, _i.e._ about 3,000,000 miles. On several other\r\noccasions the distance between Encke's comet and Mercury has been less\r\nthan 10,000,000 miles--an amount of trifling import in comparison with\r\nthe dimensions of our system. Approaches so close as this are fraught\r\nwith serious consequences to the movements of the comet. Mercury, though\r\na small body, is still sufficiently massive. It always attracts the\r\ncomet, but the efficacy of that attraction is enormously enhanced when\r\nthe comet in its wanderings comes near the planet. The effect of this\r\nattraction is to force the comet to swerve from its path, and to impress\r\ncertain changes upon its velocity. As the comet recedes, the disturbing\r\ninfluence of Mercury rapidly abates, and ere long becomes insensible.\r\nBut time cannot efface from the orbit of the comet the effect which the\r\ndisturbance of Mercury has actually accomplished. The disturbed orbit is\r\ndifferent from the undisturbed ellipse which the comet would have\r\noccupied had the influence of the sun alone determined its shape. We are\r\nable to calculate the movements of the comet as determined by the sun.\r\nWe can also calculate the effects arising from the disturbance produced\r\nby Mercury, provided we know the mass of the latter.\r\n\r\nThough Mercury is one of the smallest of the planets, it is perhaps the\r\nmost troublesome to the astronomer. It lies so close to the sun that it\r\nis seen but seldom in comparison with the other great planets. Its orbit\r\nis very eccentric, and it experiences disturbances by the attraction of\r\nother bodies in a way not yet fully understood. A special difficulty has\r\nalso been found in the attempt to place Mercury in the weighing scales.\r\nWe can weigh the whole earth, we can weigh the sun, the moon, and even\r\nJupiter and other planets, but Mercury presents difficulties of a\r\npeculiar character. Le Verrier, however, succeeded in devising a method\r\nof weighing it. He demonstrated that our earth is attracted by this\r\nplanet, and he showed how the amount of attraction may be disclosed by\r\nobservations of the sun, so that, from an examination of the\r\nobservations, he made an approximate determination of the mass of\r\nMercury. Le Verrier's result indicated that the weight of the planet was\r\nabout the fourteenth part of the weight of the earth. In other words, if\r\nour earth was placed in a balance, and fourteen globes, each equal to\r\nMercury, were laid in the other, the scales would hang evenly. It was\r\nnecessary that this result should be received with great caution. It\r\ndepended upon a delicate interpretation of somewhat precarious\r\nmeasurements. It could only be regarded as of provisional value, to be\r\ndiscarded when a better one should be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe approach of Encke's comet to Mercury, and the elaborate\r\ninvestigations of Von Asten and Backlund, in which the observations of\r\nthe body were discussed, have thrown much light on the subject; but,\r\nowing to a peculiarity in the motion of this comet, which we shall\r\npresently mention, the difficulties of this investigation are enormous.\r\nBacklund's latest result is, that the sun is 9,700,000 times as heavy as\r\nMercury, and he considers that this is worthy of great confidence. There\r\nis a considerable difference between this result (which makes the earth\r\nabout thirty times as heavy as Mercury) and that of Le Verrier; and, on\r\nthe other hand, Haerdtl has, from the motion of Winnecke's periodic\r\ncomet, found a value of the mass of Mercury which is not very different\r\nfrom Le Verrier's. Mercury is, however, the only planet about the mass\r\nof which there is any serious uncertainty, and this must not make us\r\ndoubt the accuracy of this delicate weighing-machine. Look at the orbit\r\nof Jupiter, to which Encke's comet approaches so nearly when it retreats\r\nfrom the sun. It will sometimes happen that Jupiter and the comet are in\r\nclose proximity, and then the mighty planet seriously disturbs the\r\npliable orbit of the comet. The path of the latter bears unmistakable\r\ntraces of the Jupiter perturbations, as well as of the Mercury\r\nperturbations. It might seem a hopeless task to discriminate between the\r\ninfluences of the two planets, overshadowed as they both are by the\r\nsupreme control of the sun, but contrivances of mathematical analysis\r\nare adequate to deal with the problem. They point out how much is due to\r\nMercury, how much is due to Jupiter; and the wanderings of Encke's comet\r\ncan thus be made to disclose the mass of Jupiter as well as that of\r\nMercury. Here we have a means of testing the precision of our weighing\r\nappliances. The mass of Jupiter can be measured by his moons, in the way\r\nmentioned in a previous chapter. As the satellites revolve round and\r\nround the planet, they furnish a method of measuring his weight by the\r\nrapidity of their motion. They tell us that if the sun were placed in\r\none scale of the celestial balance, it would take 1,047 bodies equal to\r\nJupiter in the other to weigh him down. Hardly a trace of uncertainty\r\nclings to this determination, and it is therefore of great interest to\r\ntest the theory of Encke's comet by seeing whether it gives an accordant\r\nresult. The comparison has been made by Von Asten. Encke's comet tells\r\nus that the sun is 1,050 times as heavy as Jupiter; so the results are\r\npractically identical, and the accuracy of the indications of the comet\r\nare confirmed. But the calculation of the perturbations of Encke's comet\r\nis so extremely intricate that Asten's result is not of great value.\r\nFrom the motion of Winnecke's periodic comet, Haerdtl has found that the\r\nsun is 1,047·17 times as heavy as Jupiter, in perfect accordance with\r\nthe best results derived from the attraction of Jupiter on his\r\nsatellites and the other planets.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto discussed the adventures of Encke's comet in cases\r\nwhere they throw light on questions otherwise more or less known to us.\r\nWe now approach a celebrated problem, on which Encke's comet is our only\r\nauthority. Every 1,210 days that comet revolves completely around its\r\norbit, and returns again to the neighbourhood of the sun. The movements\r\nof the comet are, however, somewhat irregular. We have already explained\r\nhow perturbations arise from Mercury and from Jupiter. Further\r\ndisturbances arise from the attraction of the earth and of the other\r\nremaining planets; but all these can be allowed for, and then we are\r\nentitled to expect, if the law of gravitation be universally true, that\r\nthe comet shall obey the calculations of mathematics. Encke's comet has\r\nnot justified this anticipation; at each revolution the period is\r\ngetting steadily shorter! Each time the comet comes back to perihelion\r\nin two and a half hours less than on the former occasion. Two and a half\r\nhours is, no doubt, a small period in comparison with that of an entire\r\nrevolution; but in the region of its path visible to us the comet is\r\nmoving so quickly that its motion in two and a half hours is\r\nconsiderable. This irregularity cannot be overlooked, inasmuch as it has\r\nbeen confirmed by the returns during about twenty revolutions. It has\r\nsometimes been thought that the discrepancies might be attributed to\r\nsome planetary perturbations omitted or not fully accounted for. The\r\nmasterly analysis of Von Asten and Backlund has, however, disposed of\r\nthis explanation. They have minutely studied the observations down to\r\n1891, but only to confirm the reality of this diminution in the periodic\r\ntime of Encke's comet.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of these irregularities was suggested by Encke long ago.\r\nLet us briefly attempt to describe this memorable hypothesis. When we\r\nsay that a body will move in an elliptic path around the sun in virtue\r\nof gravitation, it is always assumed that the body has a free course\r\nthrough space. It is assumed that there is no friction, no air, or other\r\nsource of disturbance. But suppose that this assumption should be\r\nincorrect; suppose that there really is some medium pervading space\r\nwhich offers resistance to the comet in the same way as the air impedes\r\nthe flight of a rifle bullet, what effect ought such a medium to\r\nproduce? This is the idea which Encke put forward. Even if the greater\r\npart of space be utterly void, so that the path of the filmy and almost\r\nspiritual comet is incapable of feeling resistance, yet in the\r\nneighbourhood of the sun it was supposed that there might be some medium\r\nof excessive tenuity capable of affecting so light a body. It can be\r\ndemonstrated that a resisting medium such as we have supposed would\r\nlessen the size of the comet's path, and diminish the periodic time.\r\nThis hypothesis has, however, now been abandoned. It has always appeared\r\nstrange that no other comet showed the least sign of being retarded by\r\nthe assumed resisting medium. But the labours of Backlund have now\r\nproved beyond a doubt that the acceleration of the motion of Encke's\r\ncomet is not a constant one, and cannot be accounted for by assuming a\r\nresisting medium distributed round the sun, no matter how we imagine\r\nthis medium to be constituted with regard to density at different\r\ndistances from the sun. Backlund found that the acceleration was fairly\r\nconstant from 1819 to 1858; it commenced to decrease between 1858 and\r\n1862, and continued to diminish till some time between 1868 and 1871,\r\nsince which time it has remained fairly constant. He considers that the\r\nacceleration can only be produced by the comet encountering periodically\r\na swarm of meteors, and if we could only observe the comet during its\r\nmotion through the greater part of its orbit we should be able to point\r\nout the locality where this encounter takes place.\r\n\r\nWe have selected the comets of Halley and of Encke as illustrations of\r\nthe class of periodic comets, of which, indeed, they are the most\r\nremarkable members. Another very remarkable periodic comet is that of\r\nBiela, of which we shall have more to say in the next chapter. Of the\r\nmuch more numerous class of non-periodic comets, examples in abundance\r\nmay be cited. We shall mention a few which have appeared during the\r\npresent century. There is first the splendid comet of 1843, which\r\nappeared suddenly in February of that year, and was so brilliant that it\r\ncould be seen during full daylight. This comet followed a path which\r\ncould not be certainly distinguished from a parabola, though there is no\r\ndoubt that it might have been a very elongated ellipse. It is frequently\r\nimpossible to decide a question of this kind, during the brief\r\nopportunities available for finding the place of the comet. We can only\r\nsee the object during a very small arc of its orbit, and even then it is\r\nnot a very well-defined point which admits of being measured with the\r\nprecision attainable in observations of a star or a planet. This comet\r\nof 1843 is, however, especially remarkable for the rapidity with which\r\nit moved, and for the close approach which it made to the sun. The heat\r\nto which it was exposed during its passage around the sun must have\r\nbeen enormously greater than the heat which can be raised in our\r\nmightiest furnaces. If the materials had been agate or cornelian, or the\r\nmost infusible substances known on the earth, they would have been fused\r\nand driven into vapour by the intensity of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nThe great comet of 1858 was one of the celestial spectacles of modern\r\ntimes. It was first observed on June 2nd of that year by Donati, whose\r\nname the comet has subsequently borne; it was then merely a faint\r\nnebulous spot, and for about three months it pursued its way across the\r\nheavens without giving any indications of the splendour which it was so\r\nsoon to attain. The comet had hardly become visible to the unaided eye\r\nat the end of August, and was then furnished with only a very small\r\ntail, but as it gradually drew nearer and nearer to the sun in\r\nSeptember, it soon became invested with splendour. A tail of majestic\r\nproportions was quickly developed, and by the middle of October, when\r\nthe maximum brightness was attained, its length extended over an arc of\r\nforty degrees. The beauty and interest of this comet were greatly\r\nenhanced by its favourable position in the sky at a season when the\r\nnights were sufficiently dark.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd May, 1881, Mr. Tebbutt, of Windsor, in New South Wales,\r\ndiscovered a comet which speedily developed into one of the most\r\ninteresting celestial objects seen by this generation. About the 22nd of\r\nJune it became visible from these latitudes in the northern sky at\r\nmidnight. Gradually it ascended higher and higher until it passed around\r\nthe pole. The nucleus of the comet was as bright as a star of the first\r\nmagnitude, and its tail was about 20° long. On the 2nd of September it\r\nceased to be visible to the unaided eye, but remained visible in\r\ntelescopes until the following February. This was the first comet which\r\nwas successfully photographed, and it may be remarked that comets\r\npossess very little actinic power. It has been estimated that moonlight\r\npossesses an intensity 300,000 times greater than that of a comet where\r\nthe purposes of photography are concerned.\r\n\r\nAnother of the bodies of this class which have received great and\r\ndeserved attention was that discovered in the southern hemisphere early\r\nin September, 1882. It increased so much in brilliancy that it was seen\r\nin daylight by Mr. Common on the 17th of that month, while on the same\r\nday the astronomers at the Cape of Good Hope were fortunate enough to\r\nhave observed the body actually approach the sun's limb, where it ceased\r\nto be visible. We know that the comet must have passed between the earth\r\nand the sun, and it is very interesting to learn from the Cape observers\r\nthat it was totally invisible when it was actually projected on the\r\nsun's disc. The following day it was again visible to the naked eye in\r\nfull daylight, not far from the sun, and valuable spectroscopic\r\nobservations were secured at Dunecht and Palermo. At that time the comet\r\nwas rushing through the part of its orbit closest to the sun, and about\r\na week later it began to be visible in the morning before sunrise, near\r\nthe eastern horizon, exhibiting a fine long tail. (_See_ Plate XVII.)\r\nThe nucleus gradually lengthened until it broke into four separate\r\npieces, lying in a straight line, while the comet's head became\r\nenveloped in a sort of faint, nebulous tube, pointing towards the sun.\r\nSeveral small detached nebulous masses became also visible, which\r\ntravelled along with the comet, though not with the same velocity. The\r\ncomet became invisible to the naked eye in February, and was last\r\nobserved telescopically in South America on the 1st June, 1883.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable resemblance between the orbit of this comet and\r\nthe orbits in which the comet of 1668, the great comet of 1843, and a\r\ngreat comet seen in 1880 in the southern hemisphere, travelled round the\r\nsun. In fact, these four comets moved along very nearly the same track\r\nand rushed round the sun within a couple of hundred thousand miles of\r\nthe surface of the photosphere. It is also possible that the comet\r\nwhich, according to Aristotle, appeared in the year 372 B.C. followed\r\nthe same orbit. And yet we cannot suppose that all these were\r\napparitions of one and the same comet, as the observations of the comet\r\nof 1882 give the period of revolution of that body equal to about 772\r\nyears. It is not impossible that the comets of 1843 and 1880 are one and\r\nthe same, but in both years the observations extend over too short a\r\ntime to enable us to decide whether the orbit was a parabola or an\r\nellipse. But as the comet of 1882 was in any case a distinct body, it\r\nseems more likely that we have here a family of comets approaching the\r\nsun from the same region of space and pursuing almost the same course.\r\nWe know a few other instances of such resemblances between the orbits of\r\ndistinct comets.\r\n\r\nOf other interesting comets seen within the last few years we may\r\nmention one discovered by Mr. Holmes in London on the 6th November,\r\n1892. It was then situated not far from the bright nebula in the\r\nconstellation Andromeda, and like it was just visible to the naked eye.\r\nThe comet became gradually fainter and more diffused, but on the 16th\r\nJanuary following it appeared suddenly with a central condensation, like\r\na star of the eighth magnitude, surrounded by a small coma. Gradually it\r\nexpanded again, and grew fainter, until it was last observed on the 6th\r\nApril.[32] The orbit was found to be an ellipse more nearly circular\r\nthan the orbit of any other known comet, the period being nearly seven\r\nyears. Another comet of 1892 is remarkable as having been discovered by\r\nProfessor Barnard, of the Lick Observatory, on a photograph of a region\r\nin Aquila; he was at once able to distinguish the comet from a nebula by\r\nits motion.\r\n\r\nSince 1864 the light of every comet which has made its appearance has\r\nbeen analysed by the spectroscope. The slight surface-brightness of\r\nthese bodies renders it necessary to open the slit of the spectroscope\r\nrather wide, and the dispersion employed cannot be very great, which\r\nagain makes accurate measurements difficult. The spectrum of a comet is\r\nchiefly characterised by three bright bands shading gradually off\r\ntowards the violet, and sharply defined on the side towards the red.\r\nThis appearance is caused by a large number of fine and close lines,\r\nwhose intensity and distance apart decrease towards the violet. These\r\nthree bands reveal the existence of hydrocarbon in comets.\r\n\r\nThe important _rôle_ which we thus find carbon playing in the\r\nconstitution of comets is especially striking when we reflect on the\r\nsignificance of the same element on the earth. We see it as the chief\r\nconstituent of all vegetable life, we find it to be invariably present\r\nin animal life. It is an interesting fact that this element, of such\r\ntranscendent importance on the earth, should now have been proved to be\r\npresent in these wandering bodies. The hydrocarbon bands are, however,\r\nnot always the only features visible in cometary spectra. In a comet\r\nseen in the spring months of 1882, Professor Copeland discovered that a\r\nnew bright yellow line, coinciding in position with the D-line of\r\nsodium, had suddenly appeared, and it was subsequently, both by him and\r\nby other observers, seen beautifully double. In fact, sodium was so\r\nstrongly represented in this comet, that both the head and the tail\r\ncould be perfectly well seen in sodium light by merely opening the slit\r\nof the spectroscope very wide, just as a solar prominence may be seen in\r\nhydrogen light. The sodium line attained its greatest brilliance at the\r\ntime when the comet was nearest to the sun, while the hydrocarbon bands\r\nwere either invisible or very faint. The same connection between the\r\nintensity of the sodium line and the distance from the sun was noticed\r\nin the great September comet of 1882.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of the great comet of 1882 was observed by Copeland and\r\nLohse on the 18th September in daylight, and, in addition to the sodium\r\nline, they saw a number of other bright lines, which seemed to be due to\r\niron vapour, while the only line of manganese visible at the temperature\r\nof a Bunsen burner was also seen. This very remarkable observation was\r\nmade less than a day after the perihelion passage, and illustrates the\r\nwonderful activity in the interior of a comet when very close to the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE COMET OF 1882,\r\n\r\nAS SEEN FROM STREATHAM, NOV. 4TH, 4 A.M.\r\n\r\nFROM A DRAWING BY T.E. KEY.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bright lines comets generally show a faint\r\ncontinuous spectrum, in which dark Fraunhofer lines can occasionally be\r\ndistinguished. Of course, this shows that the continuous spectrum is to\r\na great extent due to reflected sunlight, but there is no doubt that\r\npart of it is often due to light actually developed in the comets. This\r\nwas certainly the case in the first comet of 1884, as a sudden outburst\r\nof light in this body was accompanied by a considerable increase of\r\nbrightness of the continuous spectrum. A change in the relative\r\nbrightness of the three hydrocarbon bands indicated a considerable rise\r\nof temperature, during the continuance of which the comet emitted white\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAs comets are much nearer to the earth than the stars, it will\r\noccasionally happen that the comet must arrive at a position directly\r\nbetween the earth and a star. There is quite a similar phenomenon in the\r\nmovement of the moon. A star is frequently occulted in this way, and the\r\nobservations of such phenomena are familiar to astronomers; but when a\r\ncomet passes in front of a star the circumstances are widely different.\r\nThe star is indeed seen nearly as well through the comet as it would be\r\nif the comet were entirely out of the way. This has often been noticed.\r\nOne of the most celebrated observations of this kind was made by the\r\nlate Sir John Herschel on Biela's comet, which is one of the periodic\r\nclass, and will be alluded to in the next chapter. The illustrious\r\nastronomer saw on one occasion this object pass over a star cluster. It\r\nconsisted of excessively minute stars, which could only be seen by a\r\npowerful telescope, such as the one Sir John was using. The faintest\r\nhaze or the merest trace of a cloud would have sufficed to hide all the\r\nstars. It was therefore with no little interest that the astronomer\r\nwatched the progress of Biela's comet. Gradually the wanderer encroached\r\non the group of stars, so that if it had any appreciable solidity the\r\nnumerous twinkling points would have been completely screened. But what\r\nwere the facts? Down to the most minute star in that cluster, down to\r\nthe smallest point of light which the great telescope could show, every\r\nobject in the group was distinctly seen to twinkle right through the\r\nmass of Biela's comet.\r\n\r\nThis was an important observation. We must recollect that the veil drawn\r\nbetween the cluster and the telescope was not a thin curtain; it was a\r\nvolume of cometary substance many thousands of miles in thickness.\r\nContrast, then, the almost inconceivable tenuity of a comet with the\r\nclouds to which we are accustomed. A cloud a few hundred feet thick\r\nwill hide not only the stars, but even the great sun himself. The\r\nlightest haze that ever floated in a summer sky would do more to screen\r\nthe stars from our view than would one hundred thousand miles of such\r\ncometary material as was here interposed.\r\n\r\nThe great comet of Donati passed over many stars which were visible\r\ndistinctly through its tail. Among these stars was a very bright\r\none--the well-known Arcturus. The comet, fortunately, happened to pass\r\nover Arcturus, and though nearly the densest part of the comet was\r\ninterposed between the earth and the star, yet Arcturus twinkled on with\r\nundiminished lustre through the thickness of this stupendous curtain.\r\nRecent observations have, however, shown that stars in some cases\r\nexperience change in lustre when the denser part of the comet passes\r\nover them. It is, indeed, difficult to imagine that a star would remain\r\nvisible if the nucleus of a really large comet passed over it; but it\r\ndoes not seem that an opportunity of testing this supposition has yet\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nAs a comet contains transparent gaseous material we might expect that\r\nthe place of a star would be deranged when the comet approached it. The\r\nrefractive power of air is very considerable. When we look at the\r\nsunset, we see the sun appearing to pass below the horizon; yet the sun\r\nhas actually sunk beneath the horizon before any part of its disk\r\nappears to have commenced its descent. The refractive power of the air\r\nbends the luminous rays round and shows the sun, though it is directly\r\nscreened by the intervening obstacles. The refractive power of the\r\nmaterial of comets has been carefully tested. A comet has been observed\r\nto approach two stars; one of which was seen through the comet, while\r\nthe other could be observed directly. If the body had any appreciable\r\nquantity of gas in its composition the relative places of the two stars\r\nwould be altered. This question has been more than once submitted to the\r\ntest of actual measurement. It has sometimes been found that no\r\nappreciable change of position could be detected, and that accordingly\r\nin such cases the comet has no perceptible density. Careful measurements\r\nof the great comet in 1881 showed, however, that in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe nucleus there was some refractive power, though quite insignificant\r\nin comparison with the refraction of our atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE C.\r\n\r\nCOMET A 1892, 1. SWIFT.\r\n\r\n_Photographed by E.E. Barnard, 7th April, 1892._]\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it will probably be at once admitted that the\r\n_mass_ of a comet must be indeed a very small quantity in comparison\r\nwith its bulk. When we attempt actually to weigh the comet, our efforts\r\nhave proved abortive. We have been able to weigh the mighty planets\r\nJupiter and Saturn; we have been even able to weigh the vast sun\r\nhimself; the law of gravitation has provided us with a stupendous\r\nweighing apparatus, which has been applied in all these cases with\r\nsuccess, but the same methods applied to comets are speedily seen to be\r\nillusory. No weighing machinery known to the astronomer is delicate\r\nenough to determine the weight of a comet. All that we can accomplish in\r\nany circumstances is to weigh one heavenly body in comparison with\r\nanother. Comets seem to be almost imponderable when estimated by such\r\nrobust masses as those of the earth, or any of the other great planets.\r\nOf course, it will be understood that when we say the weight of a comet\r\nis inappreciable, we mean with regard to the other bodies of our system.\r\nPerhaps no one now doubts that a great comet must really weigh tons;\r\nthough whether those tons are to be reckoned in tens, in hundreds, in\r\nthousands, or in millions, the total seems quite insignificant when\r\ncompared with the weight of a body like the earth.\r\n\r\nThe small mass of comets is also brought before us in a very striking\r\nway when we recall what has been said in the last chapter on the\r\nimportant subject of the planetary perturbations. We have there treated\r\nof the permanence of our system, and we have shown that this permanence\r\ndepends upon certain laws which the planetary motions must invariably\r\nfulfil. The planets move nearly in circles, their orbits are all nearly\r\nin the same plane, and they all move in the same direction. The\r\npermanence of the system would be imperilled if any one of these\r\nconditions was not fulfilled. In that discussion we made no allusion to\r\nthe comets. Yet they are members of our system, and they far outnumber\r\nthe planets. The comets repudiate these rules of the road which the\r\nplanets so rigorously obey. Their orbits are never like circles; they\r\nare, indeed, more usually parabolic, and thus differ as widely as\r\npossible from the circular path. Nor do the planes of the orbits of\r\ncomets affect any particular aspect; they are inclined at all sorts of\r\nangles, and the directions in which they move seem to be mere matters of\r\ncaprice. All these articles of the planetary convention are violated by\r\ncomets, but yet our system lasts; it has lasted for countless ages, and\r\nseems destined to last for ages to come. The comets are attracted by the\r\nplanets, and conversely, the comets must attract the planets, and must\r\nperturb their orbits to some extent; but to what extent? If comets moved\r\nin orbits subject to the same general laws which characterise planetary\r\nmotion, then our argument would break down. The planets might experience\r\nconsiderable derangements from cometary attraction, and yet in the lapse\r\nof time those disturbances would neutralise each other, and the\r\npermanence of the system would be unaffected. But the case is very\r\ndifferent when we deal with the actual cometary orbits. If comets could\r\nappreciably disturb planets, those disturbances would not neutralise\r\neach other, and in the lapse of time the system would be wrecked by a\r\ncontinuous accumulation of irregularities. The facts, however, show that\r\nthe system has lived, and is living, notwithstanding comets; and hence\r\nwe are forced to the conclusion that their masses must be insignificant\r\nin comparison with those of the great planetary bodies.\r\n\r\nThese considerations exhibit the laws of universal gravitation and their\r\nrelations to the permanence of our system in a very striking light. If\r\nwe include the comets, we may say that the solar system includes many\r\nthousands of bodies, in orbits of all sizes, shapes, and positions, only\r\nagreeing in the fact that the sun occupies a focus common to all. The\r\nmajority of these bodies are imponderable in comparison with planets,\r\nand their orbits are placed anyhow, so that, although they may suffer\r\nmuch from the perturbations of the other bodies, they can in no case\r\ninflict any appreciable disturbance. There are, however, a few great\r\nplanets capable of producing vast disturbances; and if their orbits were\r\nnot properly adjusted, chaos would sooner or later be the result. By the\r\nmutual adaptations of their orbits to a nearly circular form, to a\r\nnearly coincident plane, and to a uniformity of direction, a permanent\r\ntruce has been effected among the great planets. They cannot now\r\npermanently disorganise each other, while the slight mass of the comets\r\nrenders them incompetent to do so. The stability of the great planets is\r\nthus assured; but it is to be observed that there is no guarantee of\r\nstability for comets. Their eccentric and irregular paths may undergo\r\nthe most enormous derangements; indeed, the history of astronomy\r\ncontains many instances of the vicissitudes to which a cometary career\r\nis exposed.\r\n\r\nGreat comets appear in the heavens in the most diverse circumstances.\r\nThere is no part of the sky, no constellation or region, which is not\r\nliable to occasional visits from these mysterious bodies. There is no\r\nseason of the year, no hour of the day or of the night when comets may\r\nnot be seen above the horizon. In like manner, the size and aspect of\r\nthe comets are of every character, from the dim spot just visible to an\r\neye fortified by a mighty telescope, up to a gigantic and brilliant\r\nobject, with a tail stretching across the heavens for a distance which\r\nis as far as from the horizon to the zenith. So also the direction of\r\nthe tail of the comet seems at first to admit of every possible\r\nposition: it may stand straight up in the heavens, as if the comet were\r\nabout to plunge below the horizon; it may stream down from the head of\r\nthe comet, as if the body had been shot up from below; it may slope to\r\nthe right or to the left. Amid all this variety and seeming caprice, can\r\nwe discover any feature common to the different phenomena? We shall find\r\nthat there is a very remarkable law which the tails of comets obey--a\r\nlaw so true and satisfactory, that if we are given the place of a comet\r\nin the heavens, it is possible at once to point out in what direction\r\nthe tail will lie.\r\n\r\nA beautiful comet appears in summer in the northern sky. It is near\r\nmidnight; we are gazing on the faintly luminous tail, which stands up\r\nstraight and points towards the zenith; perhaps it may be curved a\r\nlittle or possibly curved a good deal, but still, on the whole, it is\r\ndirected from the horizon to the zenith. We are not here referring to\r\nany particular comet. Every comet, large or small, that appears in the\r\nnorth must at midnight have its tail pointed up in a nearly vertical\r\ndirection. This fact, which has been verified on numerous occasions, is\r\na striking illustration of the law of direction of comets' tails. Think\r\nfor one moment of the facts of the case. It is summer; the twilight at\r\nthe north shows the position of the sun, and the tail of the comet\r\npoints directly away from the twilight and away from the sun. Take\r\nanother case. It is evening; the sun has set, the stars have begun to\r\nshine, and a long-tailed comet is seen. Let that comet be high or low,\r\nnorth or south, east or west, its tail invariably points _away_ from\r\nthat point in the west where the departing sunlight still lingers.\r\nAgain, a comet is watched in the early morning, and if the eye be moved\r\nfrom the place where the first streak of dawn is appearing to the head\r\nof the comet, then along that direction, streaming away from the sun, is\r\nfound the tail of the comet. This law is of still more general\r\napplication. At any season, at any hour of the night, the tail of a\r\ncomet is directed away from the sun.\r\n\r\nMore than three hundred years ago this fact in the movement of comets\r\narrested the attention of those who pondered on the movements of the\r\nheavenly bodies. It is a fact patent to ordinary observation, it gives\r\nsome degree of consistency to the multitudinous phenomena of comets, and\r\nit must be made the basis of our enquiries into the structure of the\r\ntails.\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining figure, Fig. 71, we show a portion of the parabolic\r\norbit of a comet, and we also represent the position of the tail of the\r\ncomet at various points of its path. It would be, perhaps, going too far\r\nto assert that throughout the whole vast journey of the comet, its tail\r\nmust always be directed from the sun. In the first place, it must be\r\nrecollected that we can only see the comet during that small part of its\r\njourney when it is approaching to or receding from the sun. It is also\r\nto be remembered that, while actually passing round the sun, the\r\nbrilliancy of the comet is so overpowered by the sun that the comet\r\noften becomes invisible, just as the stars are invisible in daylight.\r\nIndeed, in certain cases, jets of cometary material are actually\r\nprojected towards the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--The Tail of a Comet directed from the Sun.]\r\n\r\nIn a hasty consideration of the subject, it might be thought that as the\r\ncomet was dashing along with enormous velocity the tail was merely\r\nstreaming out behind, just as the shower of sparks from a rocket are\r\nstrewn along the path which it follows. This would be an entirely\r\nerroneous analogy; the comet is moving not through an atmosphere, but\r\nthrough open space, where there is no medium sufficient to sweep the\r\ntail into the line of motion. Another very remarkable feature is the\r\ngradual growth of the tail as the comet approaches the sun. While the\r\nbody is still at a great distance it has usually no perceptible tail,\r\nbut as it draws in the tail gradually develops, and in some cases\r\nreaches stupendous dimensions. It is not to be supposed that this\r\nincrease is a mere optical consequence of the diminution of distance. It\r\ncan be shown that the growth of the tail takes place much more rapidly\r\nthan it would be possible to explain in this way. We are thus led to\r\nconnect the formation of the tail with the approach to the sun, and we\r\nare accordingly in the presence of an enigma without any analogy among\r\nthe other bodies of our system.\r\n\r\nThat the comet as a whole is attracted by the sun there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever. The fact that the comet moves in an ellipse or in a parabola\r\nproves that the two bodies act and react on each other in obedience to\r\nthe law of universal gravitation. But while this is true of the comet as\r\na whole, it is no less certain that the tail of the comet is _repelled_\r\nby the sun. It is impossible to speak with certainty as to how this\r\ncomes about, but the facts of the case seem to point to an explanation\r\nof the following kind.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the spectroscope has proved with certainty the\r\npresence of hydrocarbon and other gases in comets. But we are not to\r\nconclude from this that comets are merely masses of gas moving through\r\nspace. Though the total quantity of matter in a comet, as we have seen,\r\nis exceedingly small, it is quite possible that the comet may consist of\r\na number of widely scattered particles of appreciable density; indeed,\r\nwe shall see in the next chapter, when describing the remarkable\r\nrelationship between comets and meteors, that we have reason to believe\r\nthis to be the case. We may therefore look on a comet as a swarm of tiny\r\nsolid particles, each surrounded by gas.\r\n\r\nWhen we watch a great comet approaching the sun the nucleus is first\r\nseen to become brighter and more clearly defined; at a later stage\r\nluminous matter appears to be projected from it towards the sun, often\r\nin the shape of a fan or a jet, which sometimes oscillates to and fro\r\nlike a pendulum. In the head of Halley's comet, for instance, Bessel\r\nobserved in October, 1835, that the jet in the course of eight hours\r\nswung through an angle of 36°. On other occasions concentric arcs of\r\nlight are formed round the nucleus, one after another, getting fainter\r\nas they travel further from the nucleus. Evidently the material of the\r\nfan or the arcs is repelled by the nucleus of the comet; but it is also\r\nrepelled by the sun, and this latter repulsive force compels the\r\nluminous matter to overcome the attraction of gravitation, and to turn\r\nback all round the nucleus in the direction away from the sun. In this\r\nmanner the tail is formed. (_See_ Plate XII.) The mathematical theory of\r\nthe formation of comets' tails has been developed on the assumption that\r\nthe matter which forms the tail is repelled both by the nucleus and by\r\nthe sun. This investigation was first undertaken by the great astronomer\r\nBessel, in his memoir on the appearance of Halley's comet in 1835, and\r\nit has since been considerably developed by Roche and the Russian\r\nastronomer Bredichin. Though we are, perhaps, hardly in a position to\r\naccept this theory as absolutely true, we can assert that it accounts\r\nwell for the principal phenomena observed in the formation of comets'\r\ntails.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bredichin has conducted his labours in the philosophical\r\nmanner which has led to many other great discoveries in science. He has\r\ncarefully collated the measurements and drawings of the tails of various\r\ncomets. One result has been obtained from this preliminary part of his\r\nenquiry, which possesses a value that cannot be affected even if the\r\nulterior portion of his labours should be found to require\r\nqualification. In the examination of the various tails, he observed that\r\nthe curvilinear shapes of the outlines fall into one or other of three\r\nspecial types. In the first we have the straightest tails, which point\r\nalmost directly away from the sun. In the second are classed tails\r\nwhich, after starting away from the sun, are curved backwards from the\r\ndirection towards which the comet is moving. In the third we find the\r\nappendage still more curved in towards the comet's path. It can be shown\r\nthat the tails of comets can almost invariably be identified with one or\r\nother of these three types; and in cases where the comet exhibits two\r\ntails, as has sometimes happened, then they will be found to belong to\r\ntwo of the types.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining diagram (Fig. 72) gives a sketch of an imaginary comet\r\nfurnished with tails of the three different types. The direction in\r\nwhich the comet is moving is shown by the arrow-head on the line passing\r\nthrough the nucleus. Bredichin concludes that the straightest of the\r\nthree tails, marked as Type I., is most probably due to the element\r\nhydrogen; the tails of the second form are due to the presence of some\r\nof the hydrocarbons in the body of the comet; while the small tails of\r\nthe third type may be due to iron or to some other element with a high\r\natomic weight. It will, of course, be understood that this diagram does\r\nnot represent any actual comet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--Bredichin's Theory of Comets' Tails.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Tails of the Comet of 1858.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting illustration of this theory is afforded in the case of\r\nthe celebrated comet of 1858 already referred to, of which a drawing is\r\nshown in Fig. 73. We find here, besides the great tail, which is the\r\ncharacteristic feature of the body, two other faint streaks of light.\r\nThese are the edges of the hollow cone which forms a tail of Type I.\r\nWhen we look through the central regions it will be easily understood\r\nthat the light is not sufficiently intense to be visible; at the edges,\r\nhowever, a sufficient thickness of the cometary matter is presented, and\r\nthus we have the appearance shown in this figure. It would seem that\r\nDonati's comet possessed one tail due to hydrogen, and another due to\r\nsome of the compounds of carbon. The carbon compounds involved appear to\r\nbe of considerable variety, and there is, in consequence, a disposition\r\nin the tails of the second type to a more indefinite outline than in the\r\nhydrogen tails. Cases have been recorded in which several tails have\r\nbeen seen simultaneously on the same comet. The most celebrated of these\r\nis that which appeared in the year 1744. Professor Bredichin has devoted\r\nspecial attention to the theory of this marvellous object, and he has\r\nshown with a high degree of probability how the multiform tail could be\r\naccounted for. The adjoining figure (Fig. 74) is from a sketch of this\r\nobject made on the morning of the 7th March by Mademoiselle Kirch at the\r\nBerlin Observatory. The figure shows eleven streaks, of which the first\r\nten (counting from the left) represent the bright edges of five of the\r\ntails, while the sixth and shortest tail is at the extreme right.\r\nSketches of this rare phenomenon were also made by Chéseaux at Lausanne\r\nand De L'Isle at St. Petersburg. Before the perihelion passage the\r\ncomet had only had one tail, but a very splendid one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--The Comet of 1744.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible to submit some of the questions involved to the test of\r\ncalculation, and it can be shown that the repulsive force adequate to\r\nproduce the straight tail of Type I. need only be about twelve times as\r\nlarge as the attraction of gravitation. Tails of the second type could\r\nbe produced by a repulsive force which was about equal to gravitation,\r\nwhile tails of the third type would only require a repulsive force about\r\none-quarter the power of gravitation.[33] The chief repulsive force\r\nknown in nature is derived from electricity, and it has naturally been\r\nsurmised that the phenomena of comets' tails are due to the electric\r\ncondition of the sun and of the comet. It would be premature to assert\r\nthat the electric character of the comet's tail has been absolutely\r\ndemonstrated; all that can be said is that, as it seems to account for\r\nthe observed facts, it would be undesirable to introduce some mere\r\nhypothetical repulsive force. It must be remembered that on quite other\r\ngrounds it is known that the sun is the seat of electric phenomena.\r\n\r\nAs the comet gradually recedes from the sun the repulsive force becomes\r\nweaker, and accordingly we find that the tail of the comet declines. If\r\nthe comet be a periodic one, the same series of changes may take place\r\nat its next return to perihelion. A new tail is formed, which also\r\ngradually disappears as the comet regains the depths of space. If we may\r\nemploy the analogy of terrestrial vapours to guide us in our reasoning,\r\nthen it would seem that, as the comet retreats, its tail would condense\r\ninto myriads of small particles. Over these small particles the law of\r\ngravitation would resume its undivided sway, no longer obscured by the\r\nsuperior efficiency of the repulsion. The mass of the comet is, however,\r\nso extremely small that it would not be able to recall these particles\r\nby the mere force of attraction. It follows that, as the comet at each\r\nperihelion passage makes a tail, it must on each occasion expend a\r\ncorresponding quantity of tail-making material. Let us suppose that the\r\ncomet was endowed in the beginning with a certain capital of those\r\nparticular materials which are adapted for the production of tails. Each\r\nperihelion passage witnesses the formation of a tail, and the\r\nexpenditure of a corresponding amount of the capital. It is obvious that\r\nthis operation cannot go on indefinitely. In the case of the great\r\nmajority of comets the visits to perihelion are so extremely rare that\r\nthe consequences of the extravagance are not very apparent; but to those\r\nperiodic comets which have short periods and make frequent returns, the\r\nconsequences are precisely what might have been anticipated: the\r\ntail-making capital has been gradually squandered, and thus at length we\r\nhave the spectacle of a comet without any tail at all. We can even\r\nconceive that a comet may in this manner be completely dissipated, and\r\nwe shall see in the next chapter how this fate seems to have overtaken\r\nBiela's periodic comet.\r\n\r\nBut as it sweeps through the solar system the comet may chance to pass\r\nvery near one of the larger planets, and, in passing, its motion may be\r\nseriously disturbed by the attraction of the planet. If the velocity of\r\nthe comet is accelerated by this disturbing influence, the orbit will be\r\nchanged from a parabola into another curve known as a hyperbola, and the\r\ncomet will swing round the sun and pass away never to return. But if the\r\nplanet is so situated as to retard the velocity of the comet, the\r\nparabolic orbit will be changed into an ellipse, and the comet will\r\nbecome a periodic one. We can hardly doubt that some periodic comets\r\nhave been \"captured\" in this manner and thereby made permanent members\r\nof our solar system, if we remark that the comets of short periods (from\r\nthree to eight years) come very near the orbit of Jupiter at some point\r\nor other of their paths. Each of them must, therefore, have been near\r\nthe giant planet at some moment during their past history. Similarly the\r\nother periodic comets of longer period approach near to the orbits of\r\neither Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune, the last-mentioned planet being\r\nprobably responsible for the periodicity of Halley's comet. We have,\r\nindeed, on more than one occasion, actually witnessed the violent\r\ndisturbance of a cometary orbit. The most interesting case is that of\r\nLexell's comet. In 1770 the French astronomer Messier (who devoted\r\nhimself with great success to the discovery of comets) detected a comet\r\nfor which Lexell computed the orbit, and found an ellipse with a period\r\nof five years and some months. Yet the comet had never been seen before,\r\nnor did it ever come back again. Long afterwards it was found, from most\r\nlaborious investigations by Burckhardt and Le Verrier, that the comet\r\nhad moved in a totally different orbit previous to 1767. But at the\r\nbeginning of the year 1767 it happened to come so close to Jupiter that\r\nthe powerful attraction of this planet forced it into a new orbit, with\r\na period of five and a half years. It passed the perihelion on the 13th\r\nAugust, 1770, and again in 1776, but in the latter year it was not\r\nconveniently situated for being seen from the earth. In the summer of\r\n1779 the comet was again in the neighbourhood of Jupiter, and was thrown\r\nout of its elliptic orbit, so that we have never seen it since, or,\r\nperhaps, it would be safer to say that we have not with certainty\r\nidentified Lexell's comet with any comet observed since then. We are\r\nalso, in the case of several other periodic comets, able to fix in a\r\nsimilar way the date when they started on their journeys in their\r\npresent elliptic orbits.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief outline of the principal facts known with regard to\r\nthese interesting but perplexing bodies. We must be content with the\r\nrecital of what we know, rather than hazard guesses about matters beyond\r\nour reach. We see that they are obedient to the great laws of\r\ngravitation, and afford a striking illustration of their truth. We have\r\nseen how modern science has dissipated the superstition with which, in\r\nearlier ages, the advent of a comet was regarded. We no longer regard\r\nsuch a body as a sign of impending calamity; we may rather look upon it\r\nas an interesting and a beautiful visitor, which comes to please us and\r\nto instruct us, but never to threaten or to destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSHOOTING STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Small Bodies of our System--Their Numbers--How they are\r\n     Observed--The Shooting Star--The Theory of Heat--A Great Shooting\r\n     Star--The November Meteors--Their Ancient History--The Route\r\n     followed by the Shoal--Diagram of the Shoal of Meteors--How the\r\n     Shoal becomes Spread out along its Path--Absorption of Meteors by\r\n     the Earth--The Discovery of the Relation between Meteors and\r\n     Comets--The Remarkable Investigations concerning the November\r\n     Meteors--Two Showers in Successive Years--No Particles have ever\r\n     been Identified from the Great Shooting Star Showers--Meteoric\r\n     Stones--Chladni's Researches--Early Cases of Stone-falls--The\r\n     Meteorite at Ensisheim--Collections of Meteorites--The Rowton\r\n     Siderite--Relative Frequency of Iron and Stony\r\n     Meteorites--Fragmentary Character of Meteorites--Tschermak's\r\n     Hypothesis--Effects of Gravitation on a Missile ejected from a\r\n     Volcano--Can they have come from the Moon?--The Claims of the Minor\r\n     Planets to the Parentage of Meteorites--Possible Terrestrial\r\n     Origin--The Ovifak Iron.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have dealt with the gigantic bodies which\r\nform the chief objects in what we know as the solar system. We have\r\nstudied mighty planets measuring thousands of miles in diameter, and we\r\nhave followed the movements of comets whose dimensions are often to be\r\ntold by millions of miles. Once, indeed, in a previous chapter we have\r\nmade a descent to objects much lower in the scale of magnitude, and we\r\nhave examined that numerous class of small bodies which we call the\r\nminor planets. It is now, however, our duty to make a still further, and\r\nthis time a very long step, downwards in the scale of magnitude. Even\r\nthe minor planets must be regarded as colossal objects when compared\r\nwith those little bodies whose presence is revealed to us in an\r\ninteresting and sometimes in a striking manner.\r\n\r\nThese small bodies compensate in some degree for their minute size by\r\nthe profusion in which they exist. No attempt, indeed, could be made to\r\ntell in figures the myriads in which they swarm throughout space. They\r\nare probably of very varied dimensions, some of them being many pounds\r\nor perhaps tons in weight, while others seem to be not larger than\r\npebbles, or even than grains of sand. Yet, insignificant as these bodies\r\nmay seem, the sun does not disdain to undertake their control. Each\r\nparticle, whether it be as small as the mote in a sunbeam or as mighty\r\nas the planet Jupiter, must perforce trace out its path around the sun\r\nin conformity with the laws of Kepler.\r\n\r\nWho does not know that beautiful occurrence which we call a shooting\r\nstar, or which, in its more splendid forms, is sometimes called a meteor\r\nor fireball? It is to objects of this class that we are now to direct\r\nour attention.\r\n\r\nA small body is moving round the sun. Just as a mighty planet revolves\r\nin an ellipse, so even a small object will be guided round and round in\r\nan ellipse with the sun in the focus. There are, at the present moment,\r\ninconceivable myriads of such meteors moving in this manner. They are\r\ntoo small and too distant for our telescopes, and we never see them\r\nexcept under extraordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the meteor flashes into view it is moving with such enormous\r\nvelocity that it often traverses more than twenty miles in a second of\r\ntime. Such a velocity is almost impossible near the earth's surface: the\r\nresistance of the air would prevent it. Aloft, in the emptiness of\r\nspace, there is no air to impede its flight. It may have been moving\r\nround and round the sun for thousands, perhaps for millions of years,\r\nwithout suffering any interference; but the supreme moment arrives, and\r\nthe meteor perishes in a streak of splendour.\r\n\r\nIn the course of its wanderings the body comes near the earth, and\r\nwithin a few hundred miles of its surface begins to encounter the upper\r\nsurface of the atmosphere with which the earth is enclosed. To a body\r\nmoving with the appalling velocity of a meteor, a plunge into the\r\natmosphere is usually fatal. Even though the upper layers of air are\r\nexcessively attenuated, yet they suddenly check the velocity almost as\r\na rifle bullet would be checked when fired into water. As the meteor\r\nrushes through the atmosphere the friction of the air warms its surface;\r\ngradually it becomes red-hot, then white-hot, and is finally driven off\r\ninto vapour with a brilliant light, while we on the earth, one or two\r\nhundred miles below, exclaim: \"Oh, look, there is a shooting star!\"\r\n\r\nWe have here an experiment illustrating the mechanical theory of heat.\r\nIt may seem incredible that mere friction should be sufficient to\r\ngenerate heat enough to produce so brilliant a display, but we must\r\nrecollect two facts: first, that the velocity of the meteor is, perhaps,\r\none hundred times that of a rifle bullet; and, second, that the\r\nefficiency of friction in developing heat is proportional to the square\r\nof the velocity. The meteor in passing through the air may therefore\r\ndevelop by the friction of the air about ten thousand times as much heat\r\nas the rifle bullet. We do not make an exaggerated estimate in supposing\r\nthat the latter missile becomes heated ten degrees by friction; yet if\r\nthis be admitted, we must grant that there is such an enormous\r\ndevelopment of heat attending the flight of the meteor that even a\r\nfraction of it would be sufficient to drive the object into vapour.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the circumstances in which these external bodies\r\nare manifested to us, and, for the sake of illustration, we may take a\r\nremarkable fireball which occurred on November 6th, 1869. This body was\r\nseen from many different places in England; and by combining and\r\ncomparing these observations, we obtain accurate information as to the\r\nheight of the object and the velocity with which it travelled.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this meteor commenced to be visible at a point ninety\r\nmiles above Frome, in Somersetshire, and that it vanished twenty-seven\r\nmiles over the sea, near St. Ives, in Cornwall. The path of the body,\r\nand the principal localities from which it was observed, are shown in\r\nthe map (Fig. 75). The whole length of its visible course was about 170\r\nmiles, which was performed in a period of five seconds, thus giving an\r\naverage velocity of thirty-four miles per second. A remarkable feature\r\nin the appearance which this fireball presented was the long persistent\r\nstreak of luminous cloud, about fifty miles long and four miles wide,\r\nwhich remained in sight for fully fifty minutes. We have in this example\r\nan illustration of the chief features of the phenomena of a shooting\r\nstar presented on a very grand scale. It is, however, to be observed\r\nthat the persistent luminous streak is not a universal, nor, indeed, a\r\nvery common characteristic of a shooting star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--The Path of the Fireball of November 6th,\r\n1869.]\r\n\r\nThe small objects which occasionally flash across the field of the\r\ntelescope show us that there are innumerable telescopic shooting stars,\r\ntoo small and too faint to be visible to the unaided eye. These objects\r\nare all dissipated in the way we have described; it is, in fact, only at\r\nthe moment, and during the process of their dissolution, that we become\r\naware of their existence. Small as these missiles probably are, their\r\nvelocity is so prodigious that they would render the earth uninhabitable\r\nwere they permitted to rain down unimpeded on its surface. We must,\r\ntherefore, among the other good qualities of our atmosphere, not forget\r\nthat it constitutes a kindly screen, which shields us from a tempest of\r\nmissiles, the velocity of which no artillery could equal. It is, in\r\nfact, the very fury of these missiles which is the cause of their utter\r\ndestruction. Their anxiety to strike us is so great, that friction\r\ndissolves them into harmless vapour.\r\n\r\nNext to a grand meteor such as that we have just described, the most\r\nstriking display in connection with shooting stars is what is known as a\r\nshower. These phenomena have attracted a great deal of attention within\r\nthe last century, and they have abundantly rewarded the labour devoted\r\nto them by affording some of the most interesting astronomical\r\ndiscoveries of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe showers of shooting stars do not occur very frequently. No doubt the\r\nquickened perception of those who especially attend to meteors will\r\ndetect a shower when others see only a few straggling shooting stars;\r\nbut, speaking generally, we may say that the present generation can\r\nhardly have witnessed more than two or three such occurrences. I have\r\nmyself seen two great showers, one of which, in November, 1866, has\r\nimpressed itself on my memory as a glorious spectacle.\r\n\r\nTo commence the history of the November meteors it is necessary to look\r\nback for nearly a thousand years. On the 12th of October, in the year\r\n902, occurred the death of a Moorish king, and in connection with this\r\nevent an old chronicler relates how \"that night there were seen, as it\r\nwere lances, an infinite number of stars, which scattered themselves\r\nlike rain to right and left, and that year was called the Year of the\r\nStars.\"\r\n\r\nNo one now believes that the heavens intended to commemorate the death\r\nof the king by that display. The record is, however, of considerable\r\nimportance, for it indicates the year 902 as one in which a great shower\r\nof shooting stars occurred. It was with the greatest interest\r\nastronomers perceived that this was the first recorded instance of that\r\nperiodical shower, the last of whose regular returns were seen in 1799,\r\n1833, and 1866. Further diligent literary research has revealed here and\r\nthere records of startling appearances in the heavens, which fit in with\r\nsuccessive returns of the November meteors. From the first instance, in\r\n902, to the present day there have been twenty-nine visits of the\r\nshower; and it is not unlikely that these may have all been seen in some\r\nparts of the earth. Sometimes they may have been witnessed by savages,\r\nwho had neither the inclination nor the means to place on record an\r\napparition which to them was a source of terror. Sometimes, however,\r\nthese showers were observed by civilised communities. Their nature was\r\nnot understood, but the records were made; and in some cases, at all\r\nevents, these records have withstood the corrosion of time, and have now\r\nbeen brought together to illustrate this curious subject. We have\r\naltogether historical notices of twelve of these showers, collected\r\nmainly by the industry of Professor H.A. Newton whose labours have\r\ncontributed so much to the advancement of our knowledge of shooting\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine a swarm of small objects roaming through space. Think of\r\na shoal of herrings in the ocean, extending over many square miles, and\r\ncontaining countless myriads of individuals; or think of those enormous\r\nflocks of wild pigeons in the United States of which Audubon has told\r\nus. The shoal of shooting stars is perhaps much more numerous than the\r\nherrings or the pigeons. The shooting stars are, however, not very close\r\ntogether; they are, on an average, probably some few miles apart. The\r\nactual bulk of the shoal is therefore prodigious; and its dimensions are\r\nto be measured by hundreds of thousands of miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--The Orbit of a Shoal of Meteors.]\r\n\r\nThe meteors cannot choose their own track, like the shoal of herrings,\r\nfor they are compelled to follow the route which is prescribed to them\r\nby the sun. Each one pursues its own ellipse in complete independence of\r\nits neighbours, and accomplishes its journey, thousands of millions of\r\nmiles in length, every thirty-three years. We cannot observe the meteors\r\nduring the greater part of their flight. There are countless myriads of\r\nthese bodies at this very moment coursing round their path. We never see\r\nthem till the earth catches them. Every thirty-three years the earth\r\nmakes a haul of these meteors just as successfully as the fisherman\r\namong the herrings, and in much the same way, for while the fisherman\r\nspreads his net in which the fishes meet their doom, so the earth has an\r\natmosphere wherein the meteors perish. We are told that there is no fear\r\nof the herrings becoming exhausted, for those the fishermen catch are as\r\nnothing compared to the profusion in which they abound in ocean. We may\r\nsay the same with regard to the meteors. They exist in such myriads,\r\nthat though the earth swallows up millions every thirty-three years,\r\nplenty are left for future showers. The diagram (Fig. 76) will explain\r\nthe way in which the earth makes her captures. We there see the orbit\r\nin which our globe moves around the sun, as well as the elliptic path of\r\nthe meteors, though it should be remarked that it is not convenient to\r\ndraw the figure exactly to scale, so that the path of the meteors is\r\nrelatively much larger than here represented. Once each year the earth\r\ncompletes its revolution, and between the 13th and the 16th of November\r\ncrosses the track in which the meteors move. It will usually happen that\r\nthe great shoal is not at this point when the earth is passing. There\r\nare, however, some stragglers all along the path, and the earth\r\ngenerally catches a few of these at this date. They dart into our\r\natmosphere as shooting stars, and form what we usually speak of as the\r\nNovember meteors.\r\n\r\nIt will occasionally happen that when the earth is in the act of\r\ncrossing the track it encounters the bulk of the meteors. Through the\r\nshoal our globe then plunges, enveloped, of course, with the surrounding\r\ncoat of air. Into this net the meteors dash in countless myriads, never\r\nagain to emerge. In a few hours' time, the earth, moving at the rate of\r\neighteen miles a second, has crossed the track and emerges on the other\r\nside, bearing with it the spoils of the encounter. Some few meteors,\r\nwhich have only narrowly escaped capture, will henceforth bear evidence\r\nof the fray by moving in slightly different orbits, but the remaining\r\nmeteors of the shoal continue their journey without interruption;\r\nperhaps millions have been taken, but probably hundreds of millions have\r\nbeen left.\r\n\r\nSuch was the occurrence which astonished the world on the night between\r\nNovember 13th and 14th, 1866. We then plunged into the middle of the\r\nshoal. The night was fine; the moon was absent. The meteors were\r\ndistinguished not only by their enormous multitude, but by their\r\nintrinsic magnificence. I shall never forget that night. On the\r\nmemorable evening I was engaged in my usual duty at that time of\r\nobserving nebulæ with Lord Rosse's great reflecting telescope. I was of\r\ncourse aware that a shower of meteors had been predicted, but nothing\r\nthat I had heard prepared me for the splendid spectacle so soon to be\r\nunfolded. It was about ten o'clock at night when an exclamation from an\r\nattendant by my side made me look up from the telescope, just in time to\r\nsee a fine meteor dash across the sky. It was presently followed by\r\nanother, and then again by more in twos and in threes, which showed that\r\nthe prediction of a great shower was likely to be verified. At this time\r\nthe Earl of Rosse (then Lord Oxmantown) joined me at the telescope, and,\r\nafter a brief interval, we decided to cease our observations of the\r\nnebulæ and ascend to the top of the wall of the great telescope (Fig. 7,\r\np. 18), whence a clear view of the whole hemisphere of the heavens could\r\nbe obtained. There, for the next two or three hours, we witnessed a\r\nspectacle which can never fade from my memory. The shooting stars\r\ngradually increased in number until sometimes several were seen at once.\r\nSometimes they swept over our heads, sometimes to the right, sometimes\r\nto the left, but they all diverged from the east. As the night wore on,\r\nthe constellation Leo ascended above the horizon, and then the\r\nremarkable character of the shower was disclosed. All the tracks of the\r\nmeteors radiated from Leo. (_See_ Fig. 74, p. 368.) Sometimes a meteor\r\nappeared to come almost directly towards us, and then its path was so\r\nforeshortened that it had hardly any appreciable length, and looked like\r\nan ordinary fixed star swelling into brilliancy and then as rapidly\r\nvanishing. Occasionally luminous trains would linger on for many minutes\r\nafter the meteor had flashed across, but the great majority of the\r\ntrains in this shower were evanescent. It would be impossible to say how\r\nmany thousands of meteors were seen, each one of which was bright enough\r\nto have elicited a note of admiration on any ordinary night.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining figure (Fig. 77) shows the remarkable manner in which the\r\nshooting stars of this shower diverged from a point. It is not to be\r\nsupposed that all these objects were in view at the same moment. The\r\nobserver of a shower is provided with a map of that part of the heavens\r\nin which the shooting stars appear. He then fixes his attention on one\r\nparticular shooting star, and observes carefully its track with respect\r\nto the fixed stars in its vicinity. He then draws a line upon his map\r\nin the direction in which the shooting star moved. Repeating the same\r\nobservation for several other shooting stars belonging to the shower,\r\nhis map will hardly fail to show that their different tracks almost all\r\ntend from one point or region of the figure. There are, it is true, a\r\nfew erratic ones, but the majority observe this law. It certainly looks,\r\nat first sight, as if all the shooting stars did actually dart from this\r\npoint; but a little reflection will show that this is a case in which\r\nthe real motion is different from the apparent. If there actually were a\r\npoint from which these meteors diverged, then from different parts of\r\nthe earth the point would be seen in different positions with respect to\r\nthe fixed stars; but this is not the case. The radiant, as this point is\r\ncalled, is seen in the same part of the heavens from whatever station\r\nthe shower is visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--The Radiant Point of Shooting Stars.]\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, led to accept the simple explanation afforded by the\r\ntheory of perspective. Those who are acquainted with the principles of\r\nthis science know that when a number of parallel lines in an object have\r\nto be represented in a drawing, they must all be made to pass through\r\nthe same point in the plane of the picture. When we are looking at the\r\nshooting stars, we see the projections of their paths upon the surface\r\nof the heavens. From the fact that those paths pass through the same\r\npoint, we are to infer that the shooting stars belonging to the same\r\nshower are moving in parallel lines.\r\n\r\nWe are now able to ascertain the actual direction in which the shooting\r\nstars are moving, because a line drawn from the eye of the observer to\r\nthe radiant point must be parallel to that direction. Of course, it is\r\nnot intended to convey the idea that throughout all space the shooting\r\nstars of one shower are moving in parallel lines; all we mean is that\r\nduring the short time in which we see them the motion of each of the\r\nshooting stars is sensibly a straight line, and that all these straight\r\nlines are parallel.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1883 the great meteor shoal of the Leonids (for so this\r\nshower is called) attained its greatest distance from the sun, and then\r\ncommenced to return. Each year the earth crossed the orbit of the\r\nmeteors; but the shoal was not met with, and no noteworthy shower of\r\nstars was perceived. Every succeeding year found the meteors approaching\r\nthe critical point, and the year 1899 brought the shoal to the earth's\r\ntrack. In that year a brilliant meteoric shower was expected, but the\r\nresult fell far short of expectation. The shoal of meteors is of such\r\nenormous length that it takes more than a year for the mighty procession\r\nto pass through the critical portion of its orbit which lies across the\r\ntrack of the earth. We thus see that the meteors cannot escape the\r\nearth. It may be that when the shoal begins to reach this neighbourhood\r\nthe earth will have just left this part of its path, and a year will\r\nhave elapsed before the earth gets round again. Those meteors that have\r\nthe good fortune to be in the front of the shoal will thus escape the\r\nnet, but some of those behind will not be so fortunate, and the earth\r\nwill again devour an incredible host. It has sometimes happened that\r\ncasts into the shoal have been obtained in two consecutive years. If the\r\nearth happened to pass through the front part in one year, then the\r\nshoal is so long that the earth will have moved right round its orbit\r\nof 600,000,000 miles, and will again dash through the critical spot\r\nbefore the entire number have passed. History contains records of cases\r\nwhen, in two consecutive Novembers, brilliant showers of Leonids have\r\nbeen seen.\r\n\r\nAs the earth consumes such myriads of Leonids each thirty-three years,\r\nit follows that the total number must be decreasing. The splendour of\r\nthe showers in future ages will, no doubt, be affected by this\r\ncircumstance. They cannot be always so bright as they have been. It is\r\nalso of interest to notice that the shape of the shoal is gradually\r\nchanging. Each meteor of the shoal moves in its own ellipse round the\r\nsun, and is quite independent of the rest of these bodies. Each one has\r\nthus a special period of revolution which depends upon the length of the\r\nellipse in which it happens to revolve. Two meteors will move around the\r\nsun in the same time if the lengths of their ellipses are exactly equal,\r\nbut not otherwise. The lengths of these ellipses are many hundreds of\r\nmillions of miles, and it is impossible that they can be all absolutely\r\nequal. In this may be detected the origin of a gradual change in the\r\ncharacter of the shower. Suppose two meteors A and B be such that A\r\ntravels completely round in thirty-three years, while B takes\r\nthirty-four years. If the two start together, then when A has finished\r\nthe first round B will be a year behind; the next time B will be two\r\nyears behind, and so on. The case is exactly parallel to that of a\r\nnumber of boys who start for a long race, in which they have to run\r\nseveral times round the course before the distance has been\r\naccomplished. At first they all start in a cluster, and perhaps for the\r\nfirst round or two they may remain in comparative proximity; gradually,\r\nhowever, the faster runners get ahead and the slower ones lag behind, so\r\nthe cluster becomes elongated. As the race continues, the cluster\r\nbecomes dispersed around the entire course, and perhaps the first boy\r\nwill even overtake the last. Such seems the destiny of the November\r\nmeteors in future ages. The cluster will in time come to be spread out\r\naround the whole of this mighty track, and no longer will a superb\r\ndisplay have to be recorded every thirty-three years.\r\n\r\nIt was in connection with the shower of November meteors in 1866 that a\r\nvery interesting and beautiful discovery in mathematical astronomy was\r\nmade by Professor Adams. We have seen that the Leonids must move in an\r\nelliptic path, and that they return every thirty-three years, but the\r\ntelescope cannot follow them during their wanderings. All that we know\r\nby observation is the date of their occurrence, the point of the heavens\r\nfrom which they radiate, and the great return every thirty-three years.\r\nPutting these various facts together, it is possible to determine the\r\nellipse in which the meteors move--not exactly: the facts do not go so\r\nfar--they only tell us that the ellipse must be one of five possible\r\norbits. These five possible orbits are--firstly, the immense ellipse in\r\nwhich we now know the meteorites do revolve, and for which they require\r\nthe whole thirty-three years to complete a revolution; secondly, a\r\nnearly circular orbit, very little larger than the earth's path, which\r\nthe meteors would traverse in a few days more than a year; another\r\nsimilar orbit, in which the time would be a few days short of the year;\r\nand two other small elliptical orbits lying inside the earth's orbit. It\r\nwas clearly demonstrated by Professor Newton, of New Haven, U.S.A., that\r\nthe observed facts would be explained if the meteors moved in any one of\r\nthese paths, but that they could not be explained by any other\r\nhypothesis. It remained to see which of these orbits was the true one.\r\nProfessor Newton himself made the suggestion of a possible method of\r\nsolving the problem. The test he proposed was one of some difficulty,\r\nfor it involved certain intricate calculations in the theory of\r\nperturbations. Fortunately, however, Professor Adams undertook the\r\ninquiry, and by his successful labours the path of the Leonids has been\r\ncompletely ascertained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--The History of the Leonids.]\r\n\r\nWhen the ancient records of the appearance of great Leonid showers were\r\nexamined, it was found that the date of their occurrence undergoes a\r\ngradual and continuous change, which Professor Newton fixed at one day\r\nin seventy years. It follows as a necessary consequence that the point\r\nwhere the path of the meteors crosses the earth's track is not fixed,\r\nbut that at each successive return they cross at a point about half a\r\ndegree further on in the direction in which the earth is travelling. It\r\nfollows that the orbit in which the meteors are revolving is undergoing\r\nchange; the path they follow in one revolution varies slightly from that\r\npursued in the next. As, however, these changes proceed in the same\r\ndirection, they may gradually attain considerable dimensions; and the\r\namount of change which is produced in the path of the meteors in the\r\nlapse of centuries may be estimated by the two ellipses shown in Fig.\r\n78. The continuous line represents the orbit in A.D. 126; the dotted\r\nline represents it at present.\r\n\r\nThis unmistakable change in the orbit is one that astronomers attribute\r\nto what we have already spoken of as perturbation. It is certain that\r\nthe elliptic motion of these bodies is due to the sun, and that if they\r\nwere only acted on by the sun the ellipse would remain absolutely\r\nunaltered. We see, then, in this gradual change of the ellipse the\r\ninfluence of the attractions of the planets. It was shown that if the\r\nmeteors moved in the large orbit, this shifting of the path must be due\r\nto the attraction of the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and the Earth;\r\nwhile if the meteors followed one of the smaller orbits, the planets\r\nthat would be near enough and massive enough to act sensibly on them\r\nwould be the Earth, Venus, and Jupiter. Here, then, we see how the\r\nquestion may be answered by calculation. It is difficult, but it is\r\npossible, to calculate what the attraction of the planets would be\r\ncapable of producing for each of the five different suppositions as to\r\nthe orbit. This is what Adams did. He found that if the meteors moved in\r\nthe great orbit, then the attraction of Jupiter would account for\r\ntwo-thirds of the observed change, while the remaining third was due to\r\nthe influence of Saturn, supplemented by a small addition on account of\r\nUranus. In this way the calculation showed that the large orbit was a\r\npossible one. Professor Adams also computed the amount of displacement\r\nin the path that could be produced if the meteors revolved in any of the\r\nfour smaller ellipses. This investigation was one of an arduous\r\ncharacter, but the results amply repaid the labour. It was shown that\r\nwith the smaller ellipses it would be impossible to obtain a\r\ndisplacement even one-half of that which was observed. These four orbits\r\nmust, therefore, be rejected. Thus the demonstration was complete that\r\nit is in the large path that the meteors revolve.\r\n\r\nThe movements in each revolution are guided by Kepler's laws. When at\r\nthe part of its path most distant from the sun the velocity of a meteor\r\nis at its lowest, being then but little more than a mile a second; as it\r\ndraws in, the speed gradually increases, until, when the meteor crosses\r\nthe earth's track, its velocity is no less than twenty-six miles a\r\nsecond. The earth is moving very nearly in the opposite direction at\r\nthe rate of eighteen miles a second, so that, if the meteor happen to\r\nstrike the earth's atmosphere, it does so with the enormous velocity of\r\nnearly forty-four miles a second. If a collision is escaped, then the\r\nmeteor resumes its onward journey with gradually declining velocity, and\r\nby the time it has completed its circuit a period of thirty-three years\r\nand a quarter will have elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable meteors which form the Leonids are arranged in an\r\nenormous stream, of a breadth very small in comparison with its length.\r\nIf we represent the orbit by an ellipse whose length is seven feet, then\r\nthe meteor stream will be represented by a thread of the finest\r\nsewing-silk, about a foot and a half or two feet long, creeping along\r\nthe orbit.[34] The size of this stream may be estimated from the\r\nconsideration that even its width cannot be less than 100,000 miles. Its\r\nlength may be estimated from the circumstance that, although its\r\nvelocity is about twenty-six miles a second, yet the stream takes about\r\ntwo years to pass the point where its orbit crosses the earth's track.\r\nOn the memorable night between the 13th and 14th of November, 1866, the\r\nearth plunged into this stream near its head, and did not emerge on the\r\nother side until five hours later. During that time it happened that the\r\nhemisphere of the earth which was in front contained the continents of\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa, and consequently it was in the Old World that\r\nthe great shower was seen. On that day twelvemonth, when the earth had\r\nregained the same spot, the shoal had not entirely passed, and the earth\r\nmade another plunge. This time the American continent was in the van,\r\nand consequently it was there that the shower of 1867 was seen. Even in\r\nthe following year the great shoal had not entirely passed, and since\r\nthen a few stragglers along the route have been encountered at each\r\nannual transit of the earth across this meteoric highway.\r\n\r\nThe diagram is also designed to indicate a remarkable speculation which\r\nwas put forward on the high authority of Le Verrier, with the view of\r\nexplaining how the shoal came to be introduced into the solar system.\r\nThe orbit in which the meteors revolve does not intersect the paths of\r\nJupiter, Saturn, or Mars, but it does intersect the orbit of Uranus. It\r\nmust sometimes happen that Uranus is passing through this point of its\r\npath just as the shoal arrives there. Le Verrier has demonstrated that\r\nsuch an event took place in the year A.D. 126, but that it has not\r\nhappened since. We thus seem to have a clue to a very wonderful history\r\nby which the meteors are shown to have come into our system in the year\r\nnamed. The expectations or a repetition of the great shower in 1899\r\nwhich had been widely entertained, and on good grounds, were not\r\nrealised. Hardly more than a few meteors of the ordinary type were\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the orbit of the August meteors was a parabola,\r\nSchiaparelli computed the dimensions and position in space of this\r\norbit, and when he had worked this out, he noticed that the orbit\r\ncorresponded in every particular with the orbit of a fine comet which\r\nhad appeared in the summer of 1862. This could not be a mere matter of\r\naccident. The plane in which the comet moved coincided exactly with that\r\nin which the meteors moved; so did the directions of the axes of their\r\norbits, while the direction of the motion is the same, and the shortest\r\ndistance from the sun to the orbit is also in the two cases identical.\r\nThis proved to demonstration that there must be some profound physical\r\nconnection between comets and swarms of meteors. And a further proof of\r\nthis was shortly afterwards furnished, when Le Verrier had computed the\r\norbit of the November meteors, for this was at once noticed to be\r\nprecisely the same as the orbit of a comet which had passed its\r\nperihelion in January, 1866, and for which the period of revolution had\r\nbeen found to be thirty-three years and two months.\r\n\r\nAmong the Leonids we see occasionally fireballs brighter than Venus, and\r\neven half the apparent size of the moon, bursting out with\r\nlightning-like flashes, and leaving streaks which last from a minute to\r\nan hour or more. But the great majority are only as bright as stars of\r\nthe second, third, or fourth magnitude. As the amount of light given by\r\na meteor depends on its mass and velocity, we can form some idea as to\r\nthe actual weight of one of these meteors, and it appears that most of\r\nthem do not weigh nearly as much as a quarter of an ounce; indeed, it is\r\nprobable that many do not weigh a single grain. But we have seen that a\r\ncomet in all probability is nothing but a very loose swarm of small\r\nparticles surrounded by gas of very slight density, and we have also\r\nseen that the material of a comet must by degrees be more or less\r\ndissipated through space. We have still to tell a wonderful story of the\r\nbreaking up of a comet and what appears to have become of the particles\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nA copious meteoric shower took place on the night of the 27th November,\r\n1872. On this occasion the shooting stars diverged from a radiant point\r\nin the constellation of Andromeda. As a spectacle, it was unquestionably\r\ninferior to the magnificent display of 1866, but it is difficult to say\r\nwhich of the two showers has been of greater scientific importance.\r\n\r\nIt surely is a remarkable coincidence that the earth should encounter\r\nthe Andromedes (for so this shower is called) at the very moment when it\r\nis crossing the track of Biela's comet. We have observed the direction\r\nfrom which the Andromedes come when they plunge into the atmosphere; we\r\ncan ascertain also the direction in which Biela's comet is moving when\r\nit passes the earth's track, and we find that the direction in which the\r\ncomet moves and the direction in which the meteors move are identical.\r\nThis is, in itself, a strong and almost overwhelming presumption that\r\nthe comet and the shooting stars are connected; but it is not all. We\r\nhave observations of this swarm dating back to the eighteenth century,\r\nand we find that the date of its appearance has changed from the 6th or\r\n7th of December to the end of November in perfect accordance with the\r\nretrograde motion of the crossing-point of the earth's orbit and the\r\norbit of Biela's comet. This comet was observed in 1772, and again in\r\n1805-6, before its periodic return every seven years was discovered. It\r\nwas discovered by Biela in 1826, and was observed again in 1832. In 1846\r\nthe astronomical world was startled to find that there were now two\r\ncomets in place of one, and the two fragments were again perceived at\r\nthe return in 1852. In 1859 Biela's comet could not be seen, owing to\r\nits unfavourable situation with regard to the earth. No trace of Biela's\r\ncomet was seen in 1865-66, when its return was also due, nor has it ever\r\nbeen seen since. It therefore appears that in the autumn of 1872 the\r\ntime had arrived for the return of Biela's comet, and thus the\r\noccurrence of the great shower of the Andromedes took place about the\r\ntime when Biela's comet was actually due. The inference is irresistible\r\nthat the shooting stars, if not actually a part of the comet itself, are\r\nat all events most intimately connected therewith. This shower is also\r\nmemorable for the telegram sent from Professor Klinkerfues to Mr. Pogson\r\nat Madras. The telegram ran as follows:--\"Biela touched earth on 27th.\r\nSearch near Theta Centauri.\" Pogson did search and did find a comet,\r\nbut, unfortunately, owing to bad weather he only secured observations of\r\nit on two nights. As we require three observations to determine the\r\norbit of a planet or comet, it is not possible to compute the orbit of\r\nPogson's, but it seems almost certain that the latter cannot be\r\nidentical with either of the two components of Biela's comet. It is,\r\nhowever, likely that it really was a comet moving along the same track\r\nas Biela and the meteors.\r\n\r\nAnother display of the Biela meteors took place in 1885, just giving\r\ntime for two complete revolutions of the swarm since 1872. The display\r\non the 27th November, 1885, was magnificent; Professor Newton estimated\r\nthat at the time of maximum the meteors came on at the rate of 75,000\r\nper hour. In 1892 the comet ought again to have returned to perihelion,\r\nbut in that year no meteors were seen on the 27th November, while many\r\nwere seen on the 23rd from the same radiant. The change in the point of\r\nintersection between the orbit of the meteors and the orbit of the\r\nearth indicated by this difference of four days was found by Bredichin\r\nto be due to the perturbing action of Jupiter on the motion of the\r\nswarm.\r\n\r\nIt is a noticeable circumstance that the great meteoric showers seem\r\nnever yet to have projected a missile which has reached the earth's\r\nsurface. Out of the myriads of Leonids, of Perseids, or of Andromedes,\r\nnot one particle has ever been seized and identified.[35] Those bodies\r\nwhich fall from the sky to the earth, and which we call meteorites, do\r\nnot seem to come from the great showers, so far as we know. They may,\r\nindeed, have quite a different origin from that of the periodic meteors.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat curious that the belief in the celestial origin of\r\nmeteorites is of modern growth. In ancient times there were, no doubt,\r\nrumours of wonderful stones which had fallen down from the heavens to\r\nthe earth, but these reports seem to have obtained but little credit.\r\nThey were a century ago regarded as perfectly fabulous, though there was\r\nabundant testimony on the subject. Eye-witnesses averred that they had\r\nseen the stones fall. The bodies themselves were unlike other objects in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and cases were even authenticated where men had been\r\nkilled by these celestial visitors.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the observations were generally made by ignorant and illiterate\r\npersons. The true parts of the record were so mixed up with imaginary\r\nadditions, that cautious men refused to credit the statements that such\r\nobjects really fell from the sky. Even at the present day it is often\r\nextremely difficult to obtain accurate testimony on such matters. For\r\ninstance, the fall of a meteorite was observed by a Hindoo in the\r\njungle. The stone was there, its meteoric character was undoubted, and\r\nthe witness was duly examined as to the details of the occurrence; but\r\nhe was so frightened by the noise and by the danger he believed himself\r\nto have narrowly escaped, that he could tell little or nothing. He felt\r\ncertain, however, that the meteorite had hunted him for two hours\r\nthrough the jungle before it fell to the earth!\r\n\r\nIn the year 1794 Chladni published an account of the remarkable mass of\r\niron which the traveller Pallas had discovered in Siberia. It was then\r\nfor the first time recognised that this object and others similar to it\r\nmust have had a celestial origin. But even Chladni's reputation and the\r\narguments he brought forward failed to procure universal assent. Shortly\r\nafterwards a stone of fifty-six pounds was exhibited in London, which\r\nseveral witnesses declared they had seen fall at Wold Cottage, in\r\nYorkshire, in 1795. This body was subsequently deposited in our national\r\ncollection, and is now to be seen in the Natural History Museum at South\r\nKensington. The evidence then began to pour in from other quarters;\r\nportions of stone from Italy and from Benares were found to be of\r\nidentical composition with the Yorkshire stone. The incredulity of those\r\nwho had doubted the celestial origin of these objects began to give way.\r\nA careful memoir on the Benares meteorite, by Howard, was published in\r\nthe \"Philosophical Transactions\" for 1802, while, as if to complete the\r\ndemonstration, a great shower of stones took place in the following year\r\nat L'Aigle, in Normandy. The French Academy deputed the physicist Biot\r\nto visit the locality and make a detailed examination of the\r\ncircumstances attending this memorable shower. His enquiry removed every\r\ntrace of doubt, and the meteoric stones have accordingly been\r\ntransferred from the dominions of geology to those of astronomy. It may\r\nbe noted that the recognition of the celestial origin of meteorites\r\nhappens to be simultaneous with the discovery of the first of the minor\r\nplanets. In each case our knowledge of the solar system has been\r\nextended by the addition of numerous minute bodies, which,\r\nnotwithstanding their insignificant dimensions, are pregnant with\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nWhen the possibility of stone-falls has been admitted, we can turn to\r\nthe ancient records, and assign to them the credit they merit, which\r\nwas withheld for so many centuries. Perhaps the earliest of all these\r\nstone-falls which can be said to have much pretension to historical\r\naccuracy is that of the shower which Livy describes as having fallen,\r\nabout the year 654 B.C., on the Alban Mount, near Rome. Among the more\r\nmodern instances, we may mention one which was authenticated in a very\r\nemphatic manner. It occurred in the year 1492 at Ensisheim, in Alsace.\r\nThe Emperor Maximilian ordered a minute narrative of the circumstances\r\nto be drawn up and deposited with the stone in the church. The stone was\r\nsuspended in the church for three centuries, until in the French\r\nRevolution it was carried off to Colmar, and pieces were broken from it,\r\none of which is now in our national collection. Fortunately, this\r\ninteresting object has been restored to its ancient position in the\r\nchurch at Ensisheim, where it remains an attraction to sight-seers at\r\nthis day. The account is as follows:--\"In the year of the Lord 1492, on\r\nthe Wednesday before St. Martin's Day, November 7th, a singular miracle\r\noccurred, for between eleven o'clock and noon there was a loud clap of\r\nthunder and a prolonged confused noise, which was heard at a great\r\ndistance, and a stone fell from the air in the jurisdiction of Ensisheim\r\nwhich weighed 260 pounds, and the confused noise was at other places\r\nmuch louder than here. Then a boy saw it strike on ploughed ground in\r\nthe upper field towards the Rhine and the Ill, near the district of\r\nGisgang, which was sown with wheat, and it did no harm, except that it\r\nmade a hole there; and then they conveyed it from the spot, and many\r\npieces were broken from it, which the Land Vogt forbade. They therefore\r\ncaused it to be placed in the church, with the intention of suspending\r\nit as a miracle, and there came here many people to see this stone, so\r\nthere were many remarkable conversations about this stone; the learned\r\nsaid they knew not what it was, for it was beyond the ordinary course of\r\nnature that such a large stone should smite from the height of the air,\r\nbut that it was really a miracle from God, for before that time never\r\nwas anything heard like it, nor seen, nor written. When they found that\r\nstone, it had entered into the earth to half the depth of a man's\r\nstature, which everybody explained to be the will of God that it should\r\nbe found, and the noise of it was heard at Lucerne, at Villingen, and at\r\nmany other places, so loud that the people thought that the houses had\r\nbeen overturned; and as the King Maximilian was here, the Monday after\r\nSt. Catherine's Day of the same year, his Royal Excellency ordered the\r\nstone which had fallen to be brought to the castle, and after having\r\nconversed a long time about it with the noblemen, he said that the\r\npeople of Ensisheim should take it and order it to be hung up in the\r\nchurch, and not to allow anybody to take anything from it. His\r\nExcellency, however, took two pieces of it, of which he kept one, and\r\nsent the other to Duke Sigismund of Austria, and there was a great deal\r\nof talk about the stone, which was suspended in the choir, where it\r\nstill is, and a great many people came to see it.\"\r\n\r\nAdmitting the celestial origin of the meteorites, they surely claim our\r\nclosest attention. They afford the only direct method we possess of\r\nobtaining a knowledge of the materials of bodies exterior to our planet.\r\nWe can take a meteorite in our hands, we can analyse it, and find the\r\nelements of which it is composed. We shall not attempt to enter into any\r\nvery detailed account of the structure of meteorites; it is rather a\r\nmatter for the consideration of chemists and mineralogists than for\r\nastronomers. A few of the more obvious features will be all that we\r\nrequire. They will serve as a preliminary to the discussion of the\r\nprobable origin of these bodies.\r\n\r\nIn the Natural History Museum at South Kensington we may examine a\r\nsuperb collection of meteorites. They have been brought together from\r\nall parts of the earth, and vary in size from bodies not much larger\r\nthan a pin's head up to vast masses weighing many hundredweights. There\r\nare also models of celebrated meteorites, of which the originals are\r\ndispersed through various other museums.\r\n\r\nMany meteorites have nothing very remarkable in their external\r\nappearance. If they were met with on the sea beach, they would be passed\r\nby without more notice than would be given to any other stone. Yet, what\r\na history a meteorite might tell us if we could only manage to obtain\r\nit! It fell; it was seen to fall from the sky; but what was its course\r\nanterior to that movement? Where was it 100 years ago, 1,000 years ago?\r\nThrough what regions of space has it wandered? Why did it never fall\r\nbefore? Why has it actually now fallen? Such are some of the questions\r\nwhich crowd upon us as we ponder over these most interesting bodies.\r\nSome of these objects are composed of very characteristic materials;\r\ntake, for example, one of the more recent arrivals, known as the Rowton\r\nsiderite. This body differs very much from the more ordinary kind of\r\nstony meteorite. It is an object which even a casual passer-by would\r\nhardly pass without notice. Its great weight would also attract\r\nattention, while if it be scratched or rubbed with a file, it would\r\nappear to be a mass of nearly pure iron. We know the circumstances in\r\nwhich that piece of iron fell to the earth. It was on the 20th of April,\r\n1876, about 3.40 p.m., that a strange rumbling noise, followed by a\r\nstartling explosion, was heard over an area of several miles in extent\r\namong the villages in Shropshire, eight or ten miles north of the\r\nWrekin. About an hour after this occurrence a farmer noticed that the\r\nground in one of his grass-fields had been disturbed, and he probed the\r\nhole which the meteorite had made, and found it, still warm, about\r\neighteen inches below the surface. Some men working at no great distance\r\nhad heard the noise made in its descent. This remarkable object, weighs\r\n7-3/4 lbs. It is an irregular angular mass of iron, though all its edges\r\nseem to have been rounded by fusion in its transit through the air. It\r\nis covered with a thick black pellicle of the magnetic oxide of iron,\r\nexcept at the point where it first struck the ground. The Duke of\r\nCleveland, on whose property it fell, afterwards presented it to our\r\nnational institution already referred to, where, as the Rowton siderite,\r\nit attracts the attention of everyone who is interested in these\r\nwonderful bodies.\r\n\r\nThis siderite is specially interesting on account of its distinctly\r\nmetallic character. Falls of objects of this particular type are not so\r\nfrequent as are those of the stony meteorites; in fact, there are only a\r\nfew known instances of meteoric irons having been actually seen to\r\nfall, while the observed falls of stony meteorites are to be counted in\r\nscores or in hundreds. The inference is that the iron meteorites are\r\nmuch less frequent than the stony ones. This is, however, not the\r\nimpression that the visitor to the Museum would be likely to receive. In\r\nthat extensive collection the meteoric irons are by far the most\r\nstriking objects. The explanation is not difficult. Those gigantic\r\nmasses of iron are unquestionably meteoric: no one doubts that this is\r\nthe case. Yet the vast majority of them have never been seen to fall;\r\nthey have simply been found, in circumstances which point unmistakably\r\nto their meteoric nature. Suppose, for instance, that a traveller on one\r\nof the plains of Siberia or of Central America finds a mass of metallic\r\niron lying on the surface of the ground, what explanation can be\r\nrendered of such an occurrence? No one has brought the iron there, and\r\nthere is no iron within hundreds of miles. Man never fashioned that\r\nobject, and the iron is found to be alloyed with nickel in a manner that\r\nis always observed in known meteorites, and is generally regarded as a\r\nsure indication of a meteoric origin. Observe also, that as iron\r\nperishes by corrosion in our atmosphere, that great mass of iron cannot\r\nhave lain where it is for indefinite ages; it must have been placed\r\nthere at some finite time. Only one source for such an object is\r\nconceivable; it must have fallen from the sky. On the same plains the\r\nstony meteorites have also fallen in hundreds and in thousands, but they\r\ncrumble away in the course of time, and in any case would not arrest the\r\nattention of the traveller as the irons are likely to do. Hence it\r\nfollows, that although the stony meteorites seem to fall much more\r\nfrequently, yet, unless they are actually observed at the moment of\r\ndescent, they are much more liable to be overlooked than the meteoric\r\nirons. Hence it is that the more prominent objects of the British\r\ncollection are the meteoric irons.\r\n\r\nWe have said that a noise accompanied the descent of the Rowton\r\nsiderite, and it is on record that a loud explosion took place when the\r\nmeteorite fell at Ensisheim. In this we have a characteristic feature of\r\nthe phenomenon. Nearly all the descents of meteorites that have been\r\nobserved seem to have been ushered in by a detonation. We do not,\r\nhowever, assert that this is quite an invariable feature; and it is also\r\nthe case that meteors often detonate without throwing down any solid\r\nfragments that have been collected. The violence associated with the\r\nphenomenon is forcibly illustrated by the Butsura meteorite. This object\r\nfell in India in 1861. A loud explosion was heard, several fragments of\r\nstone were collected from distances three or four miles apart; and when\r\nbrought together, they were found to fit, so as to enable the primitive\r\nform of the meteorite to be reconstructed. A few of the pieces are\r\nwanting (they were, no doubt, lost by falling unobserved into localities\r\nfrom which they could not be recovered), but we have obtained pieces\r\nquite numerous enough to permit us to form a good idea of the irregular\r\nshape of the object before the explosion occurred which shattered it\r\ninto fragments. This is one of the ordinary stony meteorites, and is\r\nthus contrasted with the Rowton siderite which we have just been\r\nconsidering. There are also other types of meteorites. The Breitenbach\r\niron, as it is called, is a good representative of a class of these\r\nbodies which lie intermediate between the meteoric irons and the stones.\r\nIt consists of a coarsely cellular mass of iron, the cavities being\r\nfilled with mineral substances. In the Museum, sections of intermediate\r\nforms are shown in which this structure is exhibited.\r\n\r\nLook first at the most obvious characteristic of these meteorites. We do\r\nnot now allude to their chemical composition, but to their external\r\nappearance. What is the most remarkable feature in the shape of these\r\nobjects?--surely it is that they are fragments. They are evidently\r\npieces that are _broken_ from some larger object. This is apparent by\r\nmerely looking at their form; it is still more manifest when we examine\r\ntheir mechanical structure. It is often found that meteorites are\r\nthemselves composed of smaller fragments. Such a structure may be\r\nillustrated by a section of an aërolite found on the Sierra of Chaco,\r\nweighing about 30 lbs. (Fig. 79).\r\n\r\nThe section here represented shows the composite structure of this\r\nobject, which belongs to the class of stony meteorites. Its shape shows\r\nthat it was really a fragment with angular edges and corners. No doubt\r\nit may have been much more considerable when it first dashed into the\r\natmosphere. The angular edges now seen on the exterior may be due to an\r\nexplosion which then occurred; but this will not account for the\r\nstructure of the interior. We there see irregular pieces of varied form\r\nand material agglomerated into a single mass. If we would seek for\r\nanalogous objects on the earth, we must look to some of the volcanic\r\nrocks, where we have multitudes of irregular angular fragments cemented\r\ntogether by a matrix in which they are imbedded. The evidence presented\r\nby this meteorite is conclusive as to one circumstance with regard to\r\nthe origin of these objects. They must have come as fragments, from some\r\nbody of considerable, if not of vast, dimensions. In this meteorite\r\nthere are numerous small grains of iron mingled with mineral substances.\r\nThe iron in many meteorites has, indeed, characters resembling those\r\nproduced by the actual blasting of iron by dynamite. Thus, a large\r\nmeteoric iron from Brazil has been found to have been actually shivered\r\ninto fragments at some time anterior to its fall on the earth. These\r\nfragments have been cemented together again by irregular veins of\r\nmineral substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Section of the Chaco Meteorite.]\r\n\r\nFor an aërolite of a very different type we may refer to the\r\ncarbonaceous meteorite of Orgueil, which fell in France on the 14th May,\r\n1864. On the occasion of its descent a splendid meteor was seen,\r\nrivalling the full moon in size. The actual diameter of this globe of\r\nfire must have been some hundreds of yards. Nearly a hundred fragments\r\nof the body were found scattered over a tract of country fifteen miles\r\nlong. This object is of particular interest, inasmuch as it belongs to a\r\nrare group of aërolites, from which metallic iron is absent. It contains\r\nmany of the same minerals which are met with in other meteorites, but in\r\nthese fragments they are _associated with carbon_, and with substances\r\nof a white or yellowish crystallisable material, soluble in ether, and\r\nresembling some of the hydrocarbons. Such a substance, if it had not\r\nbeen seen falling to the earth, would probably be deemed a product\r\nresulting from animal or vegetable life!\r\n\r\nWe have pointed out how a body moving with great velocity and impinging\r\nupon the air may become red-hot and white-hot, or even be driven off\r\ninto vapour. How, then, does it happen that meteorites escape this fiery\r\nordeal, and fall down to the earth, with a great velocity, no doubt, but\r\nstill, with very much less than that which would have sufficed to drive\r\nthem off into vapour? Had the Rowton siderite, for instance, struck our\r\natmosphere with a velocity of twenty miles a second, it seems\r\nunquestionable that it would have been dissipated by heat, though, no\r\ndoubt, the particles would ultimately coalesce so as to descend slowly\r\nto the earth in microscopic beads of iron. How has the meteorite escaped\r\nthis fate? It must be remembered that our earth is also moving with a\r\nvelocity of about eighteen miles per second, and that the _relative_\r\nvelocity with which the meteorite plunges into the air is that which\r\nwill determine the degree to which friction is operating. If the\r\nmeteorite come into direct collision with the earth, the velocity of the\r\ncollision will be extremely great; but it may happen that though the\r\nactual velocities of the two bodies are both enormous, yet the relative\r\nvelocity may be comparatively small. This is, at all events, one\r\nconceivable explanation of the arrival of a meteorite on the surface of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nWe have shown in the earlier parts of the chapter that the well-known\r\nstar showers are intimately connected with comets. In fact, each star\r\nshower revolves in the path pursued by a comet, and the shooting star\r\nparticles have, in all probability, been themselves derived from the\r\ncomet. Showers of shooting stars have, therefore, an intimate connection\r\nwith comets, but it is doubtful whether meteorites have any connection\r\nwith comets. It has already been remarked that meteorites have never\r\nbeen known to fall in the great star showers. No particle of a meteorite\r\nis known to have dropped from the countless host of the Leonids or of\r\nthe Perseids; as far as we know, the Lyrids never dropped a meteorite,\r\nnor did the Quadrantids, the Geminids, or the many other showers with\r\nwhich every astronomer is familiar. There is no reason to connect\r\nmeteorites with these showers, and it is, therefore, doubtful whether we\r\nshould connect meteorites with comets.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the origin of meteorites it is difficult to speak with\r\nany great degree of confidence. Every theory of meteorites presents\r\ndifficulties, so it seems that the only course open to us is to choose\r\nthat view of their origin which seems least improbable. It appears to me\r\nthat this condition is fulfilled in the theory entertained by the\r\nAustrian mineralogist, Tschermak. He has made a study of the meteorites\r\nin the rich collection at Vienna, and he has come to the conclusion that\r\nthe \"meteorites have had a volcanic source on some celestial body.\" Let\r\nus attempt to pursue this reasoning and discuss the problem, which may\r\nbe thus stated:--Assuming that at least some of the meteorites have been\r\nejected from volcanoes, on what body or bodies in the universe must\r\nthese volcanoes be situated? This is really a question for astronomers\r\nand mathematicians. Once the mineralogists assure us that these bodies\r\nare volcanic, the question becomes one of calculation and of the balance\r\nof probabilities.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the enquiry is to realise distinctly the dynamical\r\nconditions of the problem. Conceive a volcano to be located on a planet.\r\nThe volcano is supposed to be in a state of eruption, and in one of its\r\nmighty throes projects a missile aloft: this missile will ascend, it\r\nwill stop, and fall down again. Such is the case at present in the\r\neruptions of terrestrial volcanoes. Cotopaxi has been known to hurl\r\nprodigious stones to a vast height, but these stones assuredly return to\r\nearth. The gravitation of the earth has gradually overcome the velocity\r\nproduced by the explosion, and down the body falls. But let us suppose\r\nthat the eruption is still more violent, and that the stones are\r\nprojected from the planet to a still greater height above its surface.\r\nSuppose, for instance, that the stone should be shot up to a height\r\nequal to the planet's radius, the attraction of gravitation will then be\r\nreduced to one-fourth of what it was at the surface, and hence the\r\nplanet will find greater difficulty in pulling back the stone. Not only\r\nis the distance through which the stone has to be pulled back increased\r\nas the height increases, but the efficiency of gravitation is weakened,\r\nso that in a twofold way the difficulty of recalling the stone is\r\nincreased. We have already more than once alluded to this subject, and\r\nwe have shown that there is a certain critical velocity appropriate to\r\neach planet, and depending on its mass and its radius. If the missile be\r\nprojected upwards with a velocity equal to or greater than this, then it\r\nwill ascend never to return. We all recollect Jules Verne's voyage to\r\nthe moon, in which he described the Columbiad, an imaginary cannon,\r\ncapable of shooting out a projectile with a velocity of six or seven\r\nmiles a second. This is the critical velocity for the earth. If we could\r\nimagine the air removed, then a cannon of seven-mile power would project\r\na body upwards which would never fall down.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty about Tschermak's view of the volcanic origin of\r\nthe meteorites lies in the tremendous initial velocity which is\r\nrequired. The Columbiad is a myth, and we know no agent, natural or\r\nartificial, at the present time on the earth, adequate to the production\r\nof a velocity so appalling. The thunders of Krakatoa were heard\r\nthousands of miles away, but in its mightiest throes it discharged no\r\nmissiles with a velocity of six miles a second. We are therefore led to\r\nenquire whether any of the other celestial bodies are entitled to the\r\nparentage of the meteorites. We cannot see volcanoes on any other body\r\nexcept the moon; all the other bodies are too remote for an inspection\r\nso minute. Does it seem likely that volcanoes on the moon can ever\r\nlaunch forth missiles which fall upon the earth?\r\n\r\nThis belief was once sustained by eminent authority. The mass of the\r\nmoon is about one-eightieth of the mass of the earth. It would not be\r\ntrue to assert that the critical velocity of projection varies directly\r\nas the mass of the planet. The correct law is, that it varies directly\r\nas the square root of the mass, and inversely as the square root of the\r\nradius. It is hence shown that the velocity required to project a\r\nmissile away from the moon is only about one-sixth of that which would\r\nbe required to project a missile away from the earth. If the moon had on\r\nits surface volcanoes of one-mile power, it is quite conceivable that\r\nthese might be the source of meteorites. We have seen how the whole\r\nsurface of the moon shows traces of intense volcanic activity. A missile\r\nthus projected from the moon could undoubtedly fall on the earth, and it\r\nis not impossible that some of the meteorites may really have come from\r\nthis source. There is, however, one great difficulty about the volcanoes\r\non the moon. Suppose an object were so projected, it would, under the\r\nattraction of the earth, in accordance with Kepler's laws, move around\r\nthe earth as a focus. If we set aside the disturbances produced by all\r\nother bodies, as well as the disturbance produced by the moon itself, we\r\nsee that the meteorite if it once misses the earth can never fall\r\nthereon. It would be necessary that the shortest distance of the earth's\r\ncentre from the orbit of the projectile should be less than the radius\r\nof the earth, so that if a lunar meteorite is to fall on the earth, it\r\nmust do so the first time it goes round. The journey of a meteorite from\r\nthe moon to the earth is only a matter of days, and therefore, as\r\nmeteorites are still falling, it would follow that they must still be\r\nconstantly ejected from the moon. The volcanoes on the moon are,\r\nhowever, not now active; observers have long studied its surface, and\r\nthey find no reliable traces of volcanic activity at the present day.\r\nIt is utterly out of the question, whatever the moon may once have been\r\nable to do, that at the present date she could still continue to launch\r\nforth meteorites. It is just possible that a meteorite expelled from the\r\nmoon in remote antiquity, when its volcanoes were active, may, under the\r\ninfluence of the disturbances of the other bodies of the system, have\r\nits orbit so altered, that at length it comes within reach of the\r\natmosphere and falls to the earth, but in no circumstances could the\r\nmoon send us a meteorite at present. It is therefore reasonable to look\r\nelsewhere in our search for volcanoes fulfilling the conditions of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nLet us now direct our attention to the planets, and examine the\r\ncircumstances in which volcanoes located thereon could eject a meteorite\r\nwhich should ultimately tumble on the earth. We cannot see the planets\r\nwell enough to tell whether they have or ever had any volcanoes; but the\r\nalmost universal presence of heat in the large celestial masses seems to\r\nleave us in little doubt that some form of volcanic action might be\r\nfound in the planets. We may at once dismiss the giant planets, such as\r\nJupiter or Saturn: their appearance is very unlike a volcanic surface;\r\nwhile their great mass would render it necessary to suppose that the\r\nmeteorites were expelled with terrific velocity if they should succeed\r\nin escaping from the gravitation of the planet. Applying the rule\r\nalready given, a volcano on Jupiter would have to be five or six times\r\nas powerful as the volcano on the earth. To avoid this difficulty, we\r\nnaturally turn to the smaller planets of the system; take, for instance,\r\none of that innumerable host of minor planets, and let us enquire how\r\nfar this body is likely to have ejected a missile which should fall upon\r\nthe earth. Some of these globes are only a few miles in diameter. There\r\nare bodies in the solar system so small that a very moderate velocity\r\nwould be sufficient to project a missile away from them altogether. We\r\nhave, indeed, already illustrated this point in discussing the minor\r\nplanets. It has been suggested that a volcano placed on one of the minor\r\nplanets might be quite powerful enough to start the meteorites on a\r\nlong ramble through space until the chapter of accidents brought them\r\ninto collision with the earth. There is but little difficulty in\r\ngranting that there might be such volcanoes, and that they might be\r\nsufficiently powerful to drive bodies from the surface of the planet;\r\nbut we must remember that the missiles are to fall on the earth, and\r\ndynamical considerations are involved which merit our close attention.\r\nTo concentrate our ideas, we shall consider one of the minor planets,\r\nand for this purpose let us take Ceres. If a meteorite is to fall upon\r\nthe earth, it must pass through the narrow ring, some 8,000 miles wide,\r\nwhich marks the earth's path; it will not suffice for the missile to\r\npass through the ecliptic on the inside or on the outside of the ring,\r\nit must be actually through this narrow strip, and then if the earth\r\nhappens to be there at the same moment the meteorite will fall. The\r\nfirst condition to be secured is, therefore, that the path of the\r\nmeteorite shall traverse this narrow ring. This is to be effected by\r\nprojection from some point in the orbit of Ceres. But it can be shown on\r\npurely dynamical grounds that although the volcanic energy sufficient to\r\nremove the projectile from Ceres may be of no great account, yet if that\r\nprojectile is to cross the earth's track, the dynamical requirements of\r\nthe case demand a volcano on Ceres at the very least of three-mile\r\npower. We have thus gained but little by the suggestion of a minor\r\nplanet, for we have not found that a moderate volcanic power would be\r\nadequate. But there is another difficulty in the case of Ceres, inasmuch\r\nas the ring on the ecliptic is very narrow in comparison with the other\r\ndimensions of the problem. Ceres is a long way off, and it would require\r\nvery great accuracy in volcanic practice on Ceres to project a missile\r\nso that it should just traverse this ring and fall neither inside nor\r\noutside, neither above nor below. There must be a great many misses for\r\nevery hit. We have attempted to make the calculation by the aid of the\r\ntheory of probabilities, and we find that the chances against this\r\noccurrence are about 50,000 to 1, so that out of every 50,000\r\nprojectiles hurled from a point in the orbit of Ceres only a single one\r\ncan be expected to satisfy even the first of the conditions necessary if\r\nit is ever to tumble on our globe. It is thus evident that there are two\r\nobjections to Ceres (and the same may be said of the other minor\r\nplanets) as a possible source of the meteorites. Firstly, that\r\nnotwithstanding the small mass of the planet a very powerful volcano\r\nwould still be required; and secondly, that we are obliged to assume\r\nthat for every one which ever reached the earth at least 50,000 must\r\nhave been ejected. It is thus plain that if the meteorites have really\r\nbeen driven from some planet of the solar system, large or small, the\r\nvolcano must, from one cause or another, have been a very powerful one.\r\nWe are thus led to enquire which planet possesses on other grounds the\r\ngreatest probability in its favour.\r\n\r\nWe admit of course that at the present time the volcanoes on the earth\r\nare utterly devoid of the necessary power; but were the terrestrial\r\nvolcanoes always so feeble as they are in these later days? Grounds are\r\nnot wanting for the belief that in the very early days of geological\r\ntime the volcanic energy on the earth was much greater than at present.\r\nWe admit fully the difficulties of the view that the meteorites have\r\nreally come from the earth; but they must have some origin, and it is\r\nreasonable to indicate the source which seems to have most probability\r\nin its favour. Grant for a moment that in the primæval days of volcanic\r\nactivity there were some mighty throes which hurled forth missiles with\r\nthe adequate velocity: these missiles would ascend, they would pass from\r\nthe gravitation of the earth, they would be seized by the gravitation of\r\nthe sun, and they would be compelled to revolve around the sun for ever\r\nafter. No doubt the resistance of the air would be a very great\r\ndifficulty, but this resistance would be greatly lessened were the\r\ncrater at a very high elevation above the sea level, while, if a vast\r\nvolume of ejected gases or vapours accompanied the more solid material,\r\nthe effect of the resistance of the air would be still further reduced.\r\nSome of these objects might perhaps revolve in hyperbolic orbits, and\r\nretreat never to return; while others would be driven into elliptic\r\npaths. Round the sun these objects would revolve for ages, but at each\r\nrevolution--and here is the important point--they would traverse the\r\npoint from which they were originally launched. In other words, every\r\nobject so projected from the earth would at each revolution cross the\r\ntrack of the earth. We have in this fact an enormous probability in\r\nfavour of the earth as contrasted with Ceres. Only one Ceres-ejected\r\nmeteorite out of every 50,000 would probably cross the earth's track,\r\nwhile every earth-projected meteorite would necessarily do so.\r\n\r\nIf this view be true, then there must be hosts of meteorites traversing\r\nspace in elliptic orbits around the sun. These orbits have one feature\r\nin common: they all intersect the track of the earth. It will sometimes\r\nhappen that the earth is found at this point at the moment the meteorite\r\nis crossing; when this is the case the long travels of the little body\r\nare at an end, and it tumbles back on the earth from which it parted so\r\nmany ages ago.\r\n\r\nIt is well to emphasise the contrast between the lunar theory of\r\nmeteorites (which we think improbable) and the terrestrial theory (which\r\nappears to be probable). For the lunar theory it would, as we have seen,\r\nbe necessary that some of the lunar volcanoes should be still active. In\r\nthe terrestrial theory it is only necessary to suppose that the\r\nvolcanoes on the earth once possessed sufficient explosive power. No one\r\nsupposes that the volcanoes at present on the earth eject now the\r\nfragments which are to form future meteorites; but it seems possible\r\nthat the earth may be now slowly gathering back, in these quiet times,\r\nthe fragments she ejected in an early stage of her history. Assuming,\r\ntherefore, with Tschermak, that many meteorites have had a volcanic\r\norigin on some considerable celestial body, we are led to agree with\r\nthose who think that most probably that body is the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice a few circumstances which seem to\r\ncorroborate the view that many meteorites are of ancient terrestrial\r\norigin. The most characteristic constituent of these bodies is the alloy\r\nof iron and nickel, which is almost universally present. Sometimes, as\r\nin the Rowton siderite, the whole object consists of little else;\r\nsometimes this alloy is in grains distributed through the mass. When\r\nNordenskjöld discovered in Greenland a mass of native iron containing\r\nnickel, this was at once regarded as a celestial visitor. It was called\r\nthe Ovifak meteorite, and large pieces of the iron were conveyed to our\r\nmuseums. There is, for instance, in the national collection a most\r\ninteresting exhibit of the Ovifak substance. Close examination shows\r\nthat this so-called meteorite lies in a bed of basalt which has been\r\nvomited from the interior of the earth. Those who believe in the\r\nmeteoric origin of the Ovifak iron are constrained to admit that shortly\r\nafter the eruption of the basalt, and while it was still soft, this\r\nstupendous iron meteorite of gigantic mass and bulk happened to fall\r\ninto this particular soft bed. The view is, however, steadily gaining\r\nground that this great iron mass was no celestial visitor at all, but\r\nthat it simply came forth from the interior of the earth with the basalt\r\nitself. The beautiful specimens in the British Museum show how the iron\r\ngraduates into the basalt in such a way as to make it highly probable\r\nthat the source of the iron is really to be sought in the earth and not\r\nexternal thereto. Should further research establish this, as now seems\r\nprobable, a most important step will have been taken in proving the\r\nterrestrial origin of meteorites. If the Ovifak iron be really\r\nassociated with the basalt, we have a proof that the iron-nickel alloy\r\nis indeed a terrestrial substance, found deep in the interior of the\r\nearth, and associated with volcanic phenomena. This being so, it will be\r\nno longer difficult to account for the iron in undoubted meteorites.\r\nWhen the vast volcanoes were in activity they ejected masses of this\r\niron-alloy, which, having circulated round the sun for ages, have at\r\nlast come back again. As if to confirm this view, Professor Andrews\r\ndiscovered particles of native iron in the basalt of the Giant's\r\nCauseway, while the probability that large masses of iron are there\r\nassociated with the basaltic formation was proved by the researches on\r\nmagnetism of the late Provost Lloyd.\r\n\r\nBesides the more solid meteorites there can be no doubt that the\r\n_débris_ of the ordinary shooting stars must rain down upon the earth in\r\ngentle showers of celestial dust. The snow in the Arctic regions has\r\noften been found stained with traces of dust which contains particles of\r\niron. Similar particles have been found on the towers of cathedrals and\r\nin many other situations where it could only have been deposited from\r\nthe air. There can be hardly a doubt that some of the motes in the\r\nsunbeam, and many of the particles which good housekeepers abhor as\r\ndust, have indeed a cosmical origin. In the famous cruise of the\r\n_Challenger_ the dredges brought up from the depths of the Atlantic no\r\n\"wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\" but among the mud which\r\nthey raised are to be found numerous magnetic particles which there is\r\nevery reason to believe fell from the sky, and thence subsided to the\r\ndepths of the ocean. Sand from the deserts of Africa, when examined\r\nunder the microscope, yield traces of minute iron particles which bear\r\nthe marks of having experienced a high temperature.\r\n\r\nThe earth draws in this cosmic dust continuously, but the earth now\r\nnever parts with a particle of its mass. The consequence is inevitable;\r\nthe mass of the earth must be growing, and though the change may be a\r\nsmall one, yet to those who have studied Darwin's treatise on\r\n\"Earth-worms,\" or to those who are acquainted with the modern theory of\r\nevolution, it will be manifest that stupendous results can be achieved\r\nby slight causes which tend in one direction. It is quite probable that\r\nan appreciable part of the solid substance of our globe may have been\r\nderived from meteoric matter which descends in perennial showers upon\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STARRY HEAVENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Constellations--The Great Bear and the Pointers--The Pole\r\n     Star--Cassiopeia--Andromeda, Pegasus, and Perseus--The Pleiades:\r\n     Auriga, Capella, Aldebaran--Taurus, Orion, Sirius; Castor and\r\n     Pollux--The Lion--Boötes, Corona, and Hercules--Virgo and\r\n     Spica--Vega and Lyra--The Swan.\r\n\r\nThe student of astronomy should make himself acquainted with the\r\nprincipal constellations in the heavens. This is a pleasing acquirement,\r\nand might well form a part of the education of every child in the\r\nkingdom. We shall commence our discussion of the sidereal system with a\r\nbrief account of the principal constellations visible in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and we accompany our description with such outline maps of\r\nthe stars as will enable the beginner to identify the chief features of\r\nthe starry heavens.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter we directed the attention of the student to the\r\nremarkable constellation of stars which is known to astronomers as Ursa\r\nMajor, or the Great Bear. It forms the most conspicuous group in the\r\nnorthern skies, and in northern latitudes it never sets. At eleven p.m.\r\nin the month of April the Great Bear is directly overhead (for an\r\nobserver in the United Kingdom); at the same hour in September it is low\r\ndown in the north; at the same hour July it is in the west; by Christmas\r\nit is at the east. From the remotest antiquity this group of stars has\r\nattracted attention. The stars in the Great Bear were comprised in a\r\ngreat catalogue of stars, made two thousand years ago, which has been\r\nhanded down to us. From the positions of the stars given in this\r\ncatalogue it is possible to reconstruct the Great Bear as it appeared in\r\nthose early days. This has been done, and it appears that the seven\r\nprincipal stars have not changed in this lapse of time to any large\r\nextent, so that the configuration of the Great Bear remains practically\r\nthe same now as it was then. The beginner must first obtain an\r\nacquaintance with this group of seven stars, and then his further\r\nprogress in this branch of astronomy will be greatly facilitated. The\r\nGreat Bear is, indeed, a splendid constellation, and its only rival is\r\nto be found in Orion, which contains more brilliant stars, though it\r\ndoes not occupy so large a region in the heavens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--The Great Bear and Pole Star.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--The Great Bear and Cassiopeia.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we observe how the Great Bear enables the Pole Star,\r\nwhich is the most important object in the northern heavens, to be\r\nreadily found. The Pole Star is very conveniently indicated by the\r\ndirection of the two stars, b and a, of the Great Bear, which\r\nare, accordingly, generally known as the \"pointers.\" This use of the\r\nGreat Bear is shown on the diagram in Fig. 80, in which the line b\r\na, produced onwards and slightly curved, will conduct to the Pole\r\nStar. There is no likelihood of making any mistake in this star, as it\r\nis the only bright one in the neighbourhood. Once it has been seen it\r\nwill be readily identified on future occasions, and the observer will\r\nnot fail to notice how constant is the position which it preserves in\r\nthe heavens. The other stars either rise or set, or, like the Great\r\nBear, they dip down low in the north without actually setting, but the\r\nPole Star exhibits no considerable changes. In summer or winter, by\r\nnight or by day, the Pole Star is ever found in the same place--at\r\nleast, so far as ordinary observation is concerned. No doubt, when we\r\nuse the accurate instruments of the observatory the notion of the fixity\r\nof the Pole Star is abandoned; we then see that it has a slow motion,\r\nand that it describes a small circle every twenty-four hours around the\r\ntrue pole of the heavens, which is not coincident with the Pole Star,\r\nthough closely adjacent thereto. The distance is at present a little\r\nmore than a degree, and it is gradually lessening, until, in the year\r\nA.D. 2095, the distance will be under half a degree.\r\n\r\nThe Pole Star itself belongs to another inconsiderable group of stars\r\nknown as the Little Bear. The two principal members of this group, next\r\nin brightness to the Pole Star, are sometimes called the \"Guards.\" The\r\nGreat Bear and the Little Bear, with the Pole Star, form a group in the\r\nnorthern sky not paralleled by any similarly situated constellation in\r\nthe southern heavens. At the South Pole there is no conspicuous star to\r\nindicate its position approximately--a circumstance disadvantageous to\r\nastronomers and navigators in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt will now be easy to add a third constellation to the two already\r\nacquired. On the opposite side of the Pole Star to the Great Bear, and\r\nat about the same distance, lies a very pleasing group of five bright\r\nstars, forming a W. These are the more conspicuous members of the\r\nconstellation Cassiopeia, which contains altogether about sixty stars\r\nvisible to the naked eye. When the Great Bear is low down in the north,\r\nthen Cassiopeia is high overhead. When the Great Bear is high overhead,\r\nthen Cassiopeia is to be looked for low down in the north. The\r\nconfiguration of the leading stars is so striking that once the eye has\r\nrecognised them future identification will be very easy--the more so\r\nwhen it is borne in mind that the Pole Star lies midway between\r\nCassiopeia and the Great Bear (Fig. 81). These important constellations\r\nwill serve as guides to the rest. We shall accordingly show how the\r\nlearner may distinguish the various other groups visible from the\r\nBritish Islands or similar northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe next constellation to be recognised is the imposing group which\r\ncontains the Great Square of Pegasus. This is not, like Ursa Major, or\r\nlike Cassiopeia, said to be \"circumpolar.\" The Great Square of Pegasus\r\nsets and rises daily. It cannot be seen conveniently during the spring\r\nand the summer, but in autumn and in winter the four stars which mark\r\nthe corners of the square can be easily recognised. There are certain\r\nsmall stars within the region so limited; perhaps about thirty can be\r\ncounted by an unaided eye of ordinary power in these latitudes. In the\r\nsouth of Europe, with its pure and bright skies, the number of visible\r\nstars appears to be greatly increased. An acute observer at Athens has\r\ncounted 102 in the same region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--The Great Square of Pegasus.]\r\n\r\nThe Great Square of Pegasus can be reached by a line from the Pole Star\r\nover the end of Cassiopeia. If it be produced about as far again it will\r\nconduct the eye to the centre of the Great Square of Pegasus (Fig. 82).\r\n\r\nThe line through b and a in Pegasus continued 45° to the\r\nsouth points out the important star Fomalhaut in the mouth of the\r\nSouthern Fish. To the right of this line, nearly half-way down, is the\r\nrather vague constellation of Aquarius, where a small equilateral\r\ntriangle with a star in the centre may be noticed.\r\n\r\nThe square of Pegasus is not a felicitous illustration of the way in\r\nwhich the boundaries of the constellations should be defined. There can\r\nbe no more naturally associated group than the four stars of this\r\nsquare, and they ought surely to be included in the same constellation.\r\nThree of the stars--marked a, b, g--do belong to Pegasus; but that at\r\nthe fourth corner--also marked a--is placed in a different figure, known\r\nas Andromeda, whereof it is, indeed, the brightest member. The remaining\r\nbright stars of Andromeda are marked b and g, and they are readily\r\nidentified by producing one side of the Square of Pegasus in a curved\r\ndirection. We have thus a remarkable array of seven stars, which it is\r\nboth easy to identify and easy to remember, notwithstanding that they\r\nare contributed to by three different constellations. They are\r\nrespectively a, b, and g of Pegasus; a, b, and g of Andromeda; and a of\r\nPerseus. The three form a sort of handle, as it were, extending from one\r\nside of the square, and are a group both striking in appearance, and\r\nuseful in the further identification of celestial objects. b Andromedæ,\r\nwith two smaller stars, form the girdle of the unfortunate heroine.\r\n\r\na Persei lies between two other stars (g and d) of the\r\nsame constellation. If we draw a curve through these three and prolong\r\nit in a bold sweep, we are conducted to one of the gems of the northern\r\nheavens--the beautiful star Capella, in Auriga (Fig. 83). Close to\r\nCapella are three small stars forming an isosceles triangle--these are\r\nthe Hoedi or Kids. Capella and Vega are, with the exception of\r\nArcturus, the two most brilliant stars in the northern heavens; and\r\nthough Vega is probably the more lustrous of the two, yet the opposite\r\nopinion has been entertained. Different eyes will frequently form\r\nvarious estimates of the relative brilliancy of stars which approach\r\neach other in brightness. The difficulty of making a satisfactory\r\ncomparison between Vega and Capella is greatly increased by the wide\r\ndistance in the heavens at which they are separated, as well as by a\r\nslight difference in colour, for Vega is distinctly whiter than Capella.\r\nThis contrast between the colour of stars is often a source of\r\nuncertainty in the attempt to compare their relative brilliancy; so\r\nthat when actual measurements have to be effected by instrumental means,\r\nit is necessary to compare the two stars alternately with some object of\r\nintermediate hue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Perseus and its Neighbouring Stars.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the pole to Capella, but not quite so far away,\r\nwill be found four small stars in a quadrilateral. They form the head of\r\nthe Dragon, the rest of whose form coils right round the pole.\r\n\r\nIf we continue the curve formed by the three stars g, a, and\r\nd in Perseus, and if we bend round this curve gracefully into one\r\nof an opposite flexion, in the manner shown in Fig. 83, we are first\r\nconducted to two other principal stars in Perseus, marked e and\r\nz. The region of Perseus is one of the richest in the heavens. We\r\nhave here a most splendid portion of the Milky Way, and the field of\r\nthe telescope is crowded with stars beyond number. Even a small\r\ntelescope or an opera-glass directed to this teeming constellation\r\ncannot fail to delight the observer, and convey to him a profound\r\nimpression of the extent of the sidereal heavens. We shall give in a\r\nsubsequent paragraph a brief enumeration of some of the remarkable\r\ntelescopic objects in Perseus. Pursuing in the same figure the line\r\ne and z, we are conducted to the remarkable little group\r\nknown as the Pleiades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--The Pleiades.]\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades form a group so universally known and so easily identified\r\nthat it hardly seems necessary to give any further specific instructions\r\nfor their discovery. It may, however, be observed that in these\r\nlatitudes they cannot be seen before midnight during the summer. Let us\r\nsuppose that the search is made at about 11 p.m. at night: on the 1st of\r\nJanuary the Pleiades will be found high up in the sky in the south-west;\r\non the 1st of March, at the same hour, they will be seen to be setting\r\nin the west. On the 1st of May they are not visible; on the 1st of July\r\nthey are not visible; on the 1st of September they will be seen low down\r\nin the east. On the 1st of November they will be high in the heavens in\r\nthe south-east. On the ensuing 1st of January the Pleiades will be in\r\nthe same position as they were on the same date in the previous year,\r\nand so on from year to year. It need, perhaps, hardly be explained here\r\nthat these changes are not really due to movements of the\r\nconstellations; they are due, of course, to the apparent annual motion\r\nof the sun among the stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.--Orion, Sirius, and the Neighbouring Stars.]\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades are shown in the figure (Fig. 84), where a group of ten\r\nstars is represented, this being about the number visible with the\r\nunaided eye to those who are gifted with very acute vision. The lowest\r\ntelescopic power will increase the number of stars to thirty or forty\r\n(Galileo saw more than forty with his first telescope), while with\r\ntelescopes of greater power the number is largely increased; indeed, no\r\nfewer than 625 have been counted with the aid of a powerful telescope.\r\nThe group is, however, rather too widely scattered to make an effective\r\ntelescopic object, except with a large field and low power. Viewed\r\nthrough an opera-glass it forms a very pleasing spectacle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Castor and Pollux.]\r\n\r\nIf we draw a ray from the Pole Star to Capella, and produce it\r\nsufficiently far, as shown in Fig. 85, we come to the great\r\nconstellation of our winter sky, the splendid group of Orion. The\r\nbrilliancy of the stars in Orion, the conspicuous belt, and the\r\ntelescopic objects which it contains, alike render this group\r\nremarkable, and place it perhaps at the head of the constellations. The\r\nleading star in Orion is known either as a Orionis, or as\r\nBetelgeuze, by which name it is here designated. It lies above the three\r\nstars, d, e, z, which form the belt. Betelgeuze is a\r\nstar of the first magnitude, and so also is Rigel, on the opposite side\r\nof the belt. Orion thus enjoys the distinction of containing two stars\r\nof the first magnitude in its group, while the five other stars shown in\r\nFig. 85 are of the second magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Orion contains some important stars. If we carry on\r\nthe line of the belt upwards to the right, we are conducted to another\r\nstar of the first magnitude, Aldebaran, which strongly resembles\r\nBetelgeuze in its ruddy colour. Aldebaran is the brightest star in the\r\nconstellation of Taurus. It is this constellation which contains the\r\nPleiades already referred to, and another more scattered group known as\r\nthe Hyades, which can be discovered near Aldebaran.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--The Great Bear and the Lion.]\r\n\r\nThe line of the belt of Orion continued downwards to the left conducts\r\nthe eye to the gem of the sky, the splendid Sirius, which is the most\r\nbrilliant star in the heavens. It has, indeed, been necessary to create\r\na special order of magnitude for the reception of Sirius alone; all the\r\nother first magnitude stars, such as Vega and Capella, Betelgeuze and\r\nAldebaran, coming a long way behind. Sirius, with a few other stars of\r\nmuch less lustre, form the constellation of Canis Major.\r\n\r\nIt is useful for the learner to note the large configuration, of an\r\nirregular lozenge shape, of which the four corners are the first\r\nmagnitude stars, Aldebaran, Betelgeuze, Sirius, and Rigel (Fig. 85).\r\nThe belt of Orion is placed symmetrically in the centre of the group,\r\nand the whole figure is so striking that once perceived it is not likely\r\nto be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAbout half way from the Square of Pegasus to Aldebaran is the chief star\r\nin the Ram--a bright orb of the second magnitude; with two others it\r\nforms a curve, at the other end of which will be found g of the\r\nsame constellation, which was the first double star ever noticed.\r\n\r\nWe can again invoke the aid of the Great Bear to point out the stars in\r\nthe constellation of Gemini (Fig. 86). If the diagonal joining the stars\r\nd and b of the body of the Bear be produced in the direction\r\nopposite to the tail, it will lead to Castor and Pollux, two remarkable\r\nstars of the second magnitude. This same line carried a little further\r\non passes near the star Procyon, of the first magnitude, which is the\r\nonly conspicuous object in the constellation of the Little Dog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.--Boötes and the Crown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--Virgo and the neighbouring Constellations.]\r\n\r\nThe pointers in the Great Bear marked a b will also serve to\r\nindicate the constellation of the Lion. If we produce the line joining\r\nthem in the direction opposite from that used in finding the Pole, we\r\nare brought into the body of the Lion. This group will be recognised by\r\nthe star of the first magnitude called Regulus. It is one of a series of\r\nstars forming an object somewhat resembling a sickle: three of the group\r\nare of the second magnitude. The Sickle has a special claim on our\r\nnotice because it contains the radiant point from which the periodic\r\nshooting star shower known as the Leonids diverges. Regulus lies\r\nalongside the sun's highway through the stars, at a point which he\r\npasses on the 21st of August every year.\r\n\r\nBetween Gemini and Leo the inconspicuous constellation of the Crab may\r\nbe found; the most striking object it contains is the misty patch called\r\nPræsepe or the Bee-Hive, which the smallest opera-glass will resolve\r\ninto its component stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--The Constellation of Lyra.]\r\n\r\nThe tail of the Great Bear, when prolonged with a continuation of the\r\ncurve which it possesses, leads to a brilliant star of the first\r\nmagnitude known as Arcturus, the principal star in the constellation of\r\nBoötes (Fig. 88). A few other stars, marked b, g, d,\r\nand e in the same constellation, are also shown in the figure.\r\nAmong the stars visible in these latitudes Arcturus is to be placed next\r\nto Sirius in point of brightness. Two stars in the southern hemisphere,\r\ninvisible in these latitudes, termed a Centauri and Canopus, are\r\nnearly as bright as Vega and Capella, but not quite as bright as\r\nArcturus.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of Boötes is a striking semicircular\r\ngroup known as the Crown or Corona Borealis. It will be readily found\r\nfrom its position as indicated in the figure, or it may be identified by\r\nfollowing the curved line indicated by b, d, e, and z in the Great Bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.--Vega, the Swan, and the Eagle.]\r\n\r\nThe constellation of Virgo is principally characterised by the first\r\nmagnitude star called Spica, or a Virginis. This may be found from\r\nthe Great Bear; for if the line joining the two stars a and\r\ng in that constellation be prolonged with a slight curve, it will\r\nconduct the eye to Spica. We may here notice another of those large\r\nconfigurations which are of great assistance in the study of the stars.\r\nThere is a fine equilateral triangle, whereof Arcturus and Spica form\r\ntwo of the corners, while the third is indicated by Denebola, the bright\r\nstar near the tail of the Lion (Fig. 89).\r\n\r\nIn the summer evenings when the Crown is overhead, a line from the Pole\r\nStar through its fainter edge, continued nearly to the southern horizon,\r\nencounters the brilliant red star Cor Scorpionis, or the Scorpion's\r\nHeart (Antares), which was the first star mentioned as having been seen\r\nwith the telescope in the daytime.\r\n\r\nThe first magnitude star, Vega, in the constellation of the Lyre, can\r\nbe readily found at the corner of a bold triangle, of which the Pole\r\nStar and Arcturus form the base (Fig. 90). The brilliant whiteness of\r\nVega will arrest the attention, while the small group of neighbouring\r\nstars which form the Lyre produces one of the best defined\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nNear Vega is another important constellation, known as the Swan or\r\nCygnus. The brightest star will be identified as the vertex of a\r\nright-angled triangle, of which the line from Vega to the Pole Star is\r\nthe base, as shown in Fig. 91. There are in Cygnus five principal stars,\r\nwhich form a constellation of rather remarkable form.\r\n\r\nThe last constellation which we shall here describe is that of Aquila or\r\nthe Eagle, which contains a star of the first magnitude, known as\r\nAltair; this group can be readily found by a line from Vega over b\r\nCygni, which passes near the line of three stars, forming the\r\ncharacteristic part of the Eagle.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the opportunity to indicate in these sketches of the\r\nconstellations the positions of some other remarkable telescopic\r\nobjects, the description of which we must postpone to the following\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTANT SUNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Sirius Contrasted with the Sun--Stars can be Weighed, but not in\r\n     general Measured--The Companion of Sirius--Determination of the\r\n     Weights of Sirius and his Companion--Dark Stars--Variable and\r\n     Temporary Stars--Enormous Number of Stars.\r\n\r\nThe splendid pre-eminence of Sirius has caused it to be observed with\r\nminute care from the earliest times in the history of astronomy. Each\r\ngeneration of astronomers devoted time and labour to determine the exact\r\nplaces of the brightest stars in the heavens. A vast mass of\r\nobservations as to the place of Sirius among the stars had thus been\r\naccumulated, and it was found that, like many other stars, Sirius had\r\nwhat astronomers call _proper motion_. Comparing the place of Sirius\r\nwith regard to the other stars now with the place which it occupied one\r\nhundred years ago, there is a difference of two minutes (127\") in its\r\nsituation. This is a small quantity: it is so small that the unaided eye\r\ncould not see it. Could we now see the sky as it appeared one century\r\nago, we should still see this star in its well-known place to the left\r\nof Orion. Careful alignment by the eye would hardly detect that Sirius\r\nwas moving in two, or even in three or in four centuries. But the\r\naccuracy of the meridian circle renders these minute quantities evident,\r\nand gives to them their true significance. To the eye of the astronomer,\r\nSirius, instead of creeping along with a movement which centuries will\r\nnot show, is pursuing its majestic course with a velocity appropriate to\r\nits dimensions.\r\n\r\nThough the velocity of Sirius is _about_ 1,000 miles a minute, yet it\r\nis sometimes a little more and sometimes a little less than its mean\r\nvalue. To the astronomer this fact is pregnant with information. Were\r\nSirius an isolated star, attended only by planets of comparative\r\ninsignificance, there could be no irregularity in its motion. If it were\r\nonce started with a velocity of 1,000 miles a minute, then it must\r\npreserve that velocity. Neither the lapse of centuries nor the mighty\r\nlength of the journey could alter it. The path of Sirius would be\r\ninflexible in its direction; and it would be traversed with unalterable\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--The Orbit of Sirius (Professor Burnham).]\r\n\r\nThe fact that Sirius had not been moving uniformly was of such interest\r\nthat it arrested the attention of Bessel when he discovered the\r\nirregularities in 1844. Believing, as Bessel did, that there must be\r\nsome adequate cause for these disturbances, it was hardly possible to\r\ndoubt what the cause must be. When motion is disturbed there must be\r\nforce in action, and the only force that we recognise in such cases is\r\nthat known as gravitation. But gravity can only act from one body to\r\nanother body; so that when we seek for the derangement of Sirius by\r\ngravitation, we are obliged to suppose that there must be some mighty\r\nand massive body near Sirius. The question was taken up again by Peters\r\nand by Auwers, who were able to discover, from the irregularities of\r\nSirius, the nature of the path of the disturbing body. They were able to\r\nshow that it must revolve around Sirius in a period of about fifty\r\nyears, and although they could not tell its distance from Sirius, yet\r\nthey were able to point out the direction in which it must lie. Fig. 92\r\nshows the orbit of Sirius as given by Mr. Burnham, of Yerkes\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\nThe detection of the attendant of Sirius, and the measures which have\r\nbeen made thereon, enable us to determine the weight of this famous\r\nstar. Let us attempt to illustrate this subject. It must, no doubt, be\r\nadmitted that the numerical estimates we employ have to be received with\r\na certain degree of caution. The companion of Sirius is a difficult\r\nobject to observe, and previous to 1896 it had only been followed\r\nthrough an arc of 90°. We are, therefore, hardly as yet in a position to\r\nspeak with absolute accuracy as to the periodic time in which the\r\ncompanion completes its revolution. We may, however, take this time to\r\nbe fifty-two years. We also know the distance from Sirius to his\r\ncompanion, and we may take it to be about twenty-one times the distance\r\nfrom the earth to the sun. It is useful, in the first place, to compare\r\nthe revolution of the companion around Sirius with the revolution of the\r\nplanet Uranus around the sun. Taking the earth's distance as unity, the\r\nradius of the orbit of Uranus is about nineteen, and Uranus takes\r\neighty-four years to accomplish a complete revolution. We have no planet\r\nin the solar system at a distance of twenty-one; but from Kepler's third\r\nlaw it may be shown that, if there were such a planet, its periodic time\r\nwould be about ninety-nine years. We have now the necessary materials\r\nfor making the comparison between the mass of Sirius and the mass of\r\nthe sun. A body revolving around Sirius at a certain distance completes\r\nits journey in fifty-two years. To revolve around the sun at the same\r\ndistance a body should complete its journey in ninety-nine years. The\r\nquicker the body is moving the greater must be the centrifugal force,\r\nand the greater must be the attractive power of the central body. It can\r\nbe shown from the principles of dynamics that the attractive power is\r\ninversely proportional to the square of the periodic time. Hence, then,\r\nthe attractive power of Sirius must bear to the attractive power of the\r\nsun the proportion which the square of ninety-nine has to the square of\r\nfifty-two. As the distances are in each case supposed to be equal, the\r\nattractive powers will be proportional to the masses, and hence we\r\nconclude that the mass of Sirius, together with that of his companion,\r\nis to the mass of the sun, together with that of his planet, in the\r\nratio of three and a half to one. We had already learned that Sirius was\r\nmuch brighter than the sun; now we have learned that it is also much\r\nmore massive.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the consideration of Sirius, there is one additional\r\npoint of very great interest which it is necessary to consider. There is\r\na remarkable contrast between the brilliancy of Sirius and his\r\ncompanion. Sirius is a star far transcending all other stars of the\r\nfirst magnitude, while his companion is extremely faint. Even if it were\r\ncompletely withdrawn from the dazzling proximity of Sirius, the\r\ncompanion would be only a small star of the eighth or ninth magnitude,\r\nfar below the limits of visibility to the unaided eye. To put the matter\r\nin numerical language, Sirius is 5,000 times as bright as its companion,\r\nbut only about twice as heavy! Here is a very great contrast; and this\r\npoint will appear even more forcible if we contrast the companion of\r\nSirius with our sun. The companion is slightly heavier than our sun; but\r\nin spite of its slightly inferior bulk, our sun is much more powerful as\r\na light-giver. One hundred of the companions of Sirius would not give as\r\nmuch light as our sun! This is a result of very considerable\r\nsignificance. It teaches us that besides the great bodies in the\r\nuniverse which attract attention by their brilliancy, there are also\r\nother bodies of stupendous mass which have but little\r\nbrilliancy--probably some of them possess none at all. This suggests a\r\ngreatly enhanced conception of the majestic scale of the universe. It\r\nalso invites us to the belief that the universe which we behold bears\r\nbut a small ratio to the far larger part which is invisible in the\r\nsombre shades of night. In the wide extent of the material universe we\r\nhave here or there a star or a mass of gaseous matter sufficiently\r\nheated to be luminous, and thus to become visible from the earth; but\r\nour observation of these luminous points can tell us little of the\r\nremaining contents of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of all the variable stars is that known as Algol,\r\nwhose position in the constellation of Perseus is shown in Fig. 83. This\r\nstar is conveniently placed for observation, being visible every night\r\nin our latitude, and its interesting changes can be observed without any\r\ntelescopic aid. Everyone who desires to become acquainted with the great\r\ntruths of astronomy should be able to recognise this star, and should\r\nhave also followed it during one of its periods of change. Algol is\r\nusually a star of the second magnitude; but in a period between two and\r\nthree days, or, more accurately, in an interval of 2 days 20 hours 48\r\nminutes and 55 seconds, its brilliancy goes through a most remarkable\r\ncycle of variations. The series commences with a gradual decline of the\r\nstar's brightness, which in the course of four and a half hours falls\r\nfrom the second magnitude down to the fourth. At this lowest stage of\r\nbrightness Algol remains for about twenty minutes, and then begins to\r\nincrease, until in three and a half hours it regains the second\r\nmagnitude, at which it continues for about 2 days 12 hours, when the\r\nsame series commences anew. It seems that the period required by Algol\r\nto go through its changes is itself subject to a slow but certain\r\nvariation. We shall see in a following chapter how it has been proved\r\nthat the variability of Algol is due to the occasional interposition of\r\na dark companion which cuts off a part of the lustre of the star. All\r\nthe circumstances can thus be accounted for, and even the weight and the\r\nsize of Algol and its dark companion be determined.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other classes of variable stars, the fluctuation of\r\nwhose light can hardly be due to occasional obscuration by dark bodies.\r\nThis is particularly the case with those variables which are generally\r\nfaint, but now and then flare up for a short time, after which temporary\r\nexaltation they again sink down to their original condition. The periods\r\nof such changes are usually from six months to two years. The best known\r\nexample of a star of this class was discovered more than three hundred\r\nyears ago. It is situated in the constellation Cetus, a little south of\r\nthe equator. This object was the earliest known case of a variable star,\r\nexcept the so-called temporary stars, to which we shall presently refer.\r\nThe variable in Cetus received the name of Mira, or the wonderful. The\r\nperiod of the fluctuations of Mira Ceti is about eleven months, during\r\nthe greater part of which time the star is of the ninth magnitude, and\r\nconsequently invisible to the naked eye. When the proper time has\r\narrived, its brightness begins to increase rather suddenly. It soon\r\nbecomes a conspicuous object of the second or third magnitude. In this\r\ncondition it remains for eight or ten days, and then declines more\r\nslowly than it rose until it is reduced to its original faintness, about\r\nthree hundred days after the rise commenced.\r\n\r\nMore striking to the general observer than the ordinary variable stars\r\nare the _temporary stars_ which on rare occasions suddenly make their\r\nappearance in the heavens. The most famous object of this kind was that\r\nwhich blazed out in the beginning of November, 1572, and which when\r\nfirst seen was as bright as Venus at its maximum brightness. It could,\r\nindeed, be seen in full daylight by sharp-sighted people. As far as\r\nhistory can tell us, no other temporary star has ever been as bright as\r\nthis one. It is specially associated with the name of Tycho Brahe, for\r\nalthough he was not the discoverer, he made the best observations of the\r\nobject, and he proved that it was at a distance comparable with that of\r\nthe ordinary fixed stars. Tycho described carefully the gradual decline\r\nof the wonderful star until it disappeared from his view about the end\r\nof March, 1574, for the telescope, by which it could doubtless have been\r\nfollowed further, had not yet been invented. During the decline the\r\ncolour of the object gradually changed; at first it was white, and by\r\ndegrees became yellow, and in the spring of 1573 reddish, like\r\nAldebaran. About May, 1573, we are told somewhat enigmatically that it\r\n\"became like lead, or somewhat like Saturn,\" and so it remained as long\r\nas it was visible. What a fund of information our modern spectroscopes\r\nand other instruments would supply us with if so magnificent a star were\r\nto burst out in these modern days!\r\n\r\nBut though we have not in our own times been favoured with a view of a\r\ntemporary star as splendid as the one seen by Tycho Brahe and his\r\ncontemporaries, it has been our privilege to witness several minor\r\noutbursts of this kind. It seems likely that we should possess more\r\nrecords of temporary stars from former times if a better watch had been\r\nkept for them. That is at any rate the impression we get when we see how\r\nseveral of the modern stars of this kind have nearly escaped us\r\naltogether, notwithstanding the great number of telescopes which are now\r\npointed to the sky on every clear night.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 a star of the second magnitude suddenly appeared in the\r\nconstellation of the crown (Corona Borealis). It was first seen on the\r\n12th May, and a few days afterwards it began to fade away. Argelander's\r\nmaps of the northern heavens had been published some years previously,\r\nand when the position of the new star had been accurately determined, it\r\nwas found that it was identical with an insignificant looking star\r\nmarked on one of the maps as of the 9-1/2 magnitude. The star exists in\r\nthe same spot to this day, and it is of the same magnitude as it was\r\nprior to its spasmodic outburst in 1866. This was the first new star\r\nwhich was spectroscopically examined. We shall give in Chapter XXIII. a\r\nshort account of the features of its spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe next of these temporary bright stars, Nova Cygni, was first seen by\r\nJulius Schmidt at Athens on the 24th November, 1876, when it was between\r\nthe third and fourth magnitudes, and he maintains that it cannot have\r\nbeen conspicuous four days earlier, when he was looking at the same\r\nconstellation. By some inadvertence the news of the discovery was not\r\nproperly circulated, and the star was not observed elsewhere for about\r\nten days, when it had already become considerably fainter. The decrease\r\nof brightness went on very slowly; in October, 1877, the star was only\r\nof the tenth magnitude, and it continued getting fainter until it\r\nreached the fifteenth magnitude; in other words, it became a minute\r\ntelescopic star, and it is so still in the very same spot. As this star\r\ndid not reach the first or second magnitude it would probably have\r\nescaped notice altogether if Schmidt had not happened to look at the\r\nSwan on that particular evening.\r\n\r\nWe are not so likely to miss seeing a new star since astronomers have\r\npressed the photographic camera into their service. This became evident\r\nin 1892, when the last conspicuous temporary star appeared in Auriga. On\r\nthe 24th January, Dr. Anderson, an astronomer in Edinburgh, noticed a\r\nyellowish star of the fifth magnitude in the constellation Auriga, and a\r\nweek later, when he had compared a star-map with the heavens and made\r\nsure that the object was really a new star, he made his discovery\r\npublic. In the case of this star we are able to fix fairly closely the\r\nmoment when it first blazed out. In the course of the regular\r\nphotographic survey of the heavens undertaken at the Harvard College\r\nObservatory (Cambridge, Massachusetts) the region of the sky where the\r\nnew star appeared had been photographed on thirteen nights from October\r\n21st to December 1st, 1891, and on twelve nights from December 10th to\r\nJanuary 20th, 1892. On the first series of plates there was no trace of\r\nthe Nova, while it was visible on the very first plate of the second\r\nseries as a star of the fifth magnitude. Fortunately it turned out that\r\nProfessor Max Wolf of Heidelberg, a most successful celestial\r\nphotographer, had photographed the same region on the 8th December, and\r\nthis photograph does not show the star, so that it cannot on that night\r\nhave been as bright as the ninth magnitude. Nova Auriga must therefore\r\nhave flared up suddenly between the 8th and the 10th of December.\r\nAccording to the Harvard photographs, the first maximum of brightness\r\noccurred about the 20th of December, when the magnitude was 4-1/2. The\r\ndecrease of the brightness was very irregular; the star fluctuated for\r\nthe five weeks following the first of February between the fourth and\r\nthe sixth magnitude, but after the beginning of March, 1892, the\r\nbrightness declined very rapidly, and at the end of April the star was\r\nseen as an exceedingly faint one (sixteenth magnitude) with the great\r\nLick Refractor. When this mighty instrument was again pointed to the\r\nNova in the following August, it had risen nearly to the tenth\r\nmagnitude, after which it gradually became extremely faint again, and is\r\nso still.\r\n\r\nThe temporary and the variable stars form but a very small section of\r\nthe vast number of stars with which the vault of the heavens is studded.\r\nThat the sun is no more than a star, and the stars are no less than\r\nsuns, is a cardinal doctrine of astronomy. The imposing magnificence of\r\nthis truth is only realised when we attempt to estimate the countless\r\nmyriads of stars. This is a problem on which our calculations are\r\nnecessarily vain. Let us, therefore, invoke the aid of the poet to\r\nattempt to express the innumerable, and conclude this chapter with the\r\nfollowing lines of Mr. Allingham:--\r\n\r\n  \"But number every grain of sand,\r\n  Wherever salt wave touches land;\r\n  Number in single drops the sea;\r\n  Number the leaves on every tree,\r\n  Number earth's living creatures, all\r\n  That run, that fly, that swim, that crawl;\r\n  Of sands, drops, leaves, and lives, the count\r\n  Add up into one vast amount,\r\n  And then for every separate one\r\n  Of all those, let a flaming SUN\r\n  Whirl in the boundless skies, with each\r\n  Its massy planets, to outreach\r\n  All sight, all thought: for all we see\r\n  Encircled with infinity,\r\n  Is but an island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Interesting Stellar Objects--Stars Optically Double--The Great\r\n     Discovery of the Binary Stars made by Herschel--The Binary Stars\r\n     describe Elliptic Paths--Why is this so important?--The Law of\r\n     Gravitation--Special Double Stars--Castor--Mizar--The Coloured\r\n     Double Stars--b Cygni.\r\n\r\nThe sidereal heavens contain few more interesting objects for the\r\ntelescope than can be found in the numerous class of double stars. They\r\nare to be counted in thousands; indeed, _many_ thousands can be found in\r\nthe catalogues devoted to this special branch of astronomy. Many of\r\nthese objects are, no doubt, small and comparatively uninteresting, but\r\nsome of them are among the most conspicuous stars in the heavens, such\r\nas Sirius, whose system we have already described. We shall in this\r\nbrief account select for special discussion and illustration a few of\r\nthe more remarkable double stars. We shall particularly notice some of\r\nthose that can be readily observed with a small telescope, and we have\r\nindicated on the sketches of the constellations in a previous chapter\r\nhow the positions of these objects in the heavens can be ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt had been shown by Cassini in 1678 that certain stars, which appeared\r\nto the unaided eye as single points of light, really consisted of two or\r\nmore stars, so close together that the telescope was required for their\r\nseparation.[36] The number of these objects was gradually increased by\r\nfresh discoveries, until in 1781 (the same year in which Herschel\r\ndiscovered Uranus) a list containing eighty double stars was published\r\nby the astronomer Bode. These interesting objects claimed the attention\r\nof Herschel during his memorable researches. The list of known doubles\r\nrapidly swelled. Herschel's discoveries are to be enumerated by\r\nhundreds, while he also commenced systematic measurements of the\r\ndistance by which the stars were separated, and the direction in which\r\nthe line joining them pointed. It was these measurements which\r\nultimately led to one of the most important and instructive of all\r\nHerschel's discoveries. When, in the course of years, his observations\r\nwere repeated, Herschel found that in some cases the relative position\r\nof the stars had changed. He was thus led to the discovery that in many\r\nof the double stars the components are so related that they revolve\r\naround each other. Mark the importance of this result. We must remember\r\nthat the stars are suns, comparable, it may be, with our sun in\r\nmagnitude; so that here we have the astonishing spectacle of pairs of\r\nsuns in mutual revolution. There is nothing very surprising in the fact\r\nthat movements should be observed, for in all probability every body in\r\nthe universe is in motion. It is the particular character of the\r\nmovement which is specially interesting and instructive.\r\n\r\nIt had been imagined that the proximity of the two stars forming a\r\ndouble must be only accidental. It was thought that amid the vast host\r\nof stars in the heavens it not unfrequently happened that one star was\r\nso nearly behind another (as seen from the earth) that when the two were\r\nviewed in the telescope they produced the effect of a double star. No\r\ndoubt many of the so-called double stars are produced in this way.\r\nHerschel's discovery shows that this explanation will not always answer,\r\nbut that in many cases we really have two stars close together, and in\r\nmotion round their common centre of gravity.\r\n\r\nWhen the measurements of the distances and the positions of double stars\r\nhad been accumulated during many years, they were taken over by the\r\nmathematicians to be treated by their methods. There is one peculiarity\r\nabout double star observations: they have not--they cannot have--the\r\naccuracy which the computer of an orbit demands. If the distance between\r\nthe pair of stars forming a binary be four seconds, the orbit we have to\r\nscrutinise is only as large as the apparent size of a penny-piece at the\r\ndistance of one mile. It would require very careful measurement to make\r\nout the form of a penny a mile off, even with good telescopes. If the\r\npenny were tilted a little, it would appear, not circular, but oval; and\r\nit would be possible, by measuring this oval, to determine how much the\r\npenny was tilted. All this requires skilful work: the errors, viewed\r\nintrinsically, may not be great, but viewed with reference to the whole\r\nsize of the quantities under consideration, they are very appreciable.\r\nWe therefore find the errors of observation far more prominent in\r\nobservations of this class than is generally the case when the\r\nmathematician assumes the task of discussing the labours of the\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of Herschel's discovery was not accomplished by\r\nhimself; the light of mathematics was turned on his observations of the\r\nbinary stars by Savary, and afterwards by other mathematicians. Under\r\ntheir searching enquiries the errors of the measurements were disclosed,\r\nand the observations were purified from the grosser part of their\r\ninaccuracy. Mathematicians could then apply to their corrected materials\r\nthe methods of enquiry with which they were familiar; they could deduce\r\nwith fair precision the actual shape of the orbit of the binary stars,\r\nand the position of the plane in which that orbit is contained. The\r\nresult is not a little remarkable. It has been proved that the motion of\r\neach of the stars is performed in an ellipse which contains the centre\r\nof gravity of the two stars in its focus. This has been actually shown\r\nto be true in many binary stars; it is believed to be true in all. But\r\nwhy is this so important? Is not motion in an ellipse common enough?\r\nDoes not the earth revolve in an ellipse round the sun? And do not the\r\nplanets also revolve in ellipses?\r\n\r\nIt is this very fact that elliptic motion is so common in the planets of\r\nthe solar system which renders its discovery in binary stars of such\r\nimportance. From what does the elliptic motion in the solar system\r\narise? Is it not due to the law of attraction, discovered by Newton,\r\nwhich states that every mass attracts every other mass with a force\r\nwhich varies inversely as the square of the distance? That law of\r\nattraction had been found to pervade the whole solar system, and it\r\nexplained the movements of the bodies of our system with marvellous\r\nfidelity. But the solar system, consisting of the sun, and the planets,\r\nwith their satellites, the comets, and a host of smaller bodies, formed\r\nmerely a little island group in the universe. In the economy of this\r\ntiny cosmical island the law of gravitation reigns supreme; before\r\nHerschel's discovery we never could have known whether that law was not\r\nmerely a piece of local legislation, specially contrived for the\r\nexigencies of our particular system. This discovery gave us the\r\nknowledge which we could have gained from no other source. From the\r\nbinary stars came a whisper across the vast abyss of space. That whisper\r\ntold us that the law of gravitation was not peculiar to the solar\r\nsystem. It told us the law extended to the distant shores of the abyss\r\nin which our island is situated. It gives us grounds for believing that\r\nthe law of gravitation is obeyed throughout the length, breadth, and\r\ndepth of the entire visible universe.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest binary stars is that known as Castor, the brighter of\r\nthe two principal stars in the constellation of Gemini. The position of\r\nCastor on the heavens is indicated in Fig. 86, page 418. Viewed by the\r\nunaided eye, Castor resembles a single star; but with a moderately good\r\ntelescope it is found that what seems to be one star is really two\r\nseparate stars, one of which is of the third magnitude, while the other\r\nis somewhat less. The angular distance of these two stars in the heavens\r\nis not so great as the angle subtended by a line an inch long viewed at\r\na distance of half a mile. Castor is one of the double stars in which\r\nthe components have been observed to possess a motion of revolution. The\r\nmovement is, however, extremely slow, and the lapse of centuries will be\r\nrequired before a revolution is completely effected.\r\n\r\nA beautiful double star can be readily identified in the constellation\r\nof Ursa Major (_see_ Fig. 80, page 410). It is known as Mizar, and is\r\nthe middle star (z) of the three which form the tail. In the close\r\nneighbourhood of Mizar is the small star Alcor, which can be readily\r\nseen with the unaided eye; but when we speak of Mizar as a double star,\r\nit is not to be understood that Alcor is one of the components of the\r\ndouble. Under the magnifying power of the telescope Alcor is seen to be\r\ntransferred a long way from Mizar, while Mizar itself is split up into\r\ntwo suns close together. These components are of the second and the\r\nfourth magnitudes respectively, and as the apparent distance is nearly\r\nthree times as great as in Castor, they are observed with facility even\r\nin a small telescope. This is, indeed, the best double star in the\r\nheavens for the beginner to commence his observations upon. We cannot,\r\nhowever, assert that Mizar is a binary, inasmuch as observations have\r\nnot yet established the existence of a motion of revolution. Still less\r\nare we able to say whether Alcor is also a member of the same group, or\r\nwhether it may not merely be a star which happens to fall nearly in the\r\nline of vision. Recent spectroscopic observations have shown that the\r\nlarger component of Mizar is itself a double, consisting of a pair of\r\nsuns so close together that there is not the slightest possibility of\r\ntheir ever being seen separately by the most powerful telescope in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nA pleasing class of double stars is that in which we have the remarkable\r\nphenomenon of colours, differing in a striking degree from the colours\r\nof ordinary stars. Among the latter we find, in the great majority of\r\ncases, no very characteristic hue; some are, however, more or less\r\ntinged with red, some are decidedly ruddy, and some are intensely red.\r\nStars of a bluish or greenish colour are much more rare,[37] and when a\r\nstar of this character does occur, it is almost invariably as one of a\r\npair which form a double. The other star of the double is sometimes of\r\nthe same hue, but more usually it is yellow or ruddy.\r\n\r\nOne of the loveliest of these objects, which lies within reach of\r\ntelescopes of very moderate pretensions, is that found in the\r\nconstellation of the Swan, and known as b Cygni (Fig. 91). This\r\nexquisite object is composed of two stars. The larger, about the third\r\nmagnitude, is of a golden-yellow, or topaz, colour; the smaller, of the\r\nsixth magnitude, is of a light blue. These colours are nearly\r\ncomplementary, but still there can be no doubt that the effect is not\r\nmerely one of contrast. That these two stars are both tinged with the\r\nhues we have stated can be shown by hiding each in succession behind a\r\nbar placed in the field of view. It has also been confirmed in a very\r\nstriking manner by spectroscopic investigation; for we see that the blue\r\nstar has experienced a special absorption of the red rays, while the\r\nmore ruddy light of the other star has arisen from the absorption of the\r\nblue rays. The contrast of the colours in this object can often be very\r\neffectively seen by putting the eye-piece out of focus. The discs thus\r\nproduced show the contrast of colours better than when the telescope\r\nexhibits merely two stellar points.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of these double and multiple stars. Their numbers are\r\nbeing annually augmented; indeed, one observer--Mr. Burnham, formerly on\r\nthe staff of the Lick Observatory, and now an observer in the Yerkes\r\nObservatory--has added by his own researches more than 1,000 new doubles\r\nto the list of those previously known.\r\n\r\nThe interest in this class of objects must necessarily be increased when\r\nwe reflect that, small as the stars appear to be in our telescopes, they\r\nare in reality suns of great size and splendour, in many cases rivalling\r\nour own sun, or, perhaps, even surpassing him. Whether these suns have\r\nplanets attending upon them we cannot tell; the light reflected from the\r\nplanet would be utterly inadequate to the penetration of the vast extent\r\nof space which separates us from the stars. If there be planets\r\nsurrounding these objects, then, instead of a single sun, such planets\r\nwill be illuminated by two, or, perhaps, even more suns. What wondrous\r\neffects of light and shade must be the result! Sometimes both suns will\r\nbe above the horizon together, sometimes only one sun, and sometimes\r\nboth will be absent. Especially remarkable would be the condition of a\r\nplanet whose suns were of the coloured type. To-day we have a red sun\r\nilluminating the heavens, to-morrow it would be a blue sun, and,\r\nperhaps, the day after both the red sun and the blue sun will be in the\r\nfirmament together. What endless variety of scenery such a thought\r\nsuggests! There are, however, grave dynamical reasons for doubting\r\nwhether the conditions under which such a planet would exist could be\r\nmade compatible with life in any degree resembling the life with which\r\nwe are familiar. The problem of the movement of a planet under the\r\ninfluence of two suns is one of the most difficult that has ever been\r\nproposed to mathematicians, and it is, indeed, impossible in the present\r\nstate of analysis to solve with accuracy all the questions which it\r\nimplies. It seems not at all unlikely that the disturbances of the\r\nplanet's orbit would be so great that it would be exposed to\r\nvicissitudes of light and of temperature far transcending those\r\nexperienced by a planet moving, like the earth, under the supreme\r\ncontrol of a single sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTANCES OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Sounding-line for Space--The Labours of Bessel--Meaning of Annual\r\n     Parallax--Minuteness of the Parallactic Ellipse Illustrated--The\r\n     Case of 61 Cygni--Different Comparison Stars used--The Proper\r\n     Motion of the Star--Struve's Investigations--Can they be\r\n     Reconciled?--Researches at Dunsink--Conclusion obtained--Accuracy\r\n     which such Observations admit Examined--The Proper Motion of 61\r\n     Cygni--The Permanence of the Sidereal Heavens--The New Star in\r\n     Cygnus--Its History--No Appreciable Parallax--A Mighty Outburst of\r\n     Light--The Movement of the Solar System through Space--Herschel's\r\n     Discovery--Journey towards Lyra--Probabilities.\r\n\r\nWe have long known the dimensions of the solar system with more or less\r\naccuracy. Our knowledge includes the distances of the planets and the\r\ncomets from the sun, as well as their movements. We have also\r\nconsiderable knowledge of the diameters and the masses of many of the\r\ndifferent bodies which belong to the solar system. We have long known,\r\nin fact, many details of the isolated group nestled together under the\r\nprotection of the sun. The problem for consideration in the present\r\nchapter involves a still grander survey than is required for measures of\r\nour solar system. We propose to carry the sounding-line across the vast\r\nabyss which separates the group of bodies closely associated about our\r\nsun from the other stars which are scattered through the realms of\r\nspace. For centuries the great problem of star distance has engaged the\r\nattention of those who have studied the heavens. It would be impossible\r\nto attempt here even an outline of the various researches which have\r\nbeen made on the subject. In the limited survey which we can make, we\r\nmust glance first at the remarkable speculative efforts which have been\r\ndirected to the problem, and then we shall refer to those labours which\r\nhave introduced the problem into the region of accurate astronomy.\r\n\r\nNo attempt to solve the problem of the absolute distances of the stars\r\nwas successful until many years after Herschel's labours were closed.\r\nFresh generations of astronomers, armed with fresh appliances, have for\r\nmany years pursued the subject with unremitting diligence, but for a\r\nlong time the effort seemed hopeless. The distances of the stars were so\r\ngreat that they could not be ascertained until the utmost refinements of\r\nmechanical skill and the most elaborate methods of mathematical\r\ncalculation were brought to converge on the difficulty. At last it was\r\nfound that the problem was beginning to yield. A few stars have been\r\ninduced to disclose the secret of their distance. We are able to give\r\nsome answer to the question--How far are the stars? though it must be\r\nconfessed that our reply up to the present moment is both hesitating and\r\nimperfect. Even the little knowledge which has been gained possesses\r\ninterest and importance. As often happens in similar cases, the\r\ndiscovery of the distance of a star was made independently about the\r\nsame time by two or three astronomers. The name of Bessel stands out\r\nconspicuously in this memorable chapter of astronomy. Bessel proved\r\n(1840) that the distance of the star known as 61 Cygni was a measurable\r\nquantity. His demonstration possessed such unanswerable logic that\r\nuniversal assent could not be withheld. Almost simultaneously with the\r\nclassical labours of Bessel we have Struve's measurement of the distance\r\nof Vega, and Henderson's determination of the distance of the southern\r\nstar a Centauri. Great interest was excited in the astronomical\r\nworld by these discoveries, and the Royal Astronomical Society awarded\r\nits gold medal to Bessel. It appropriately devolved on Sir John Herschel\r\nto deliver the address on the occasion of the presentation of the medal:\r\nthat address is a most eloquent tribute to the labours of the three\r\nastronomers. We cannot resist quoting the few lines in which Sir John\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen of the Royal Astronomical Society,--I congratulate you\r\n     and myself that we have lived to see the great and hitherto\r\n     impassable barrier to our excursion into the sidereal universe,\r\n     that barrier against which we have chafed so long and so\r\n     vainly--_æstuantes angusto limite mundi_--almost simultaneously\r\n     overleaped at three different points. It is the greatest and most\r\n     glorious triumph which practical astronomy has ever witnessed.\r\n     Perhaps I ought not to speak so strongly; perhaps I should hold\r\n     some reserve in favour of the bare possibility that it may be all\r\n     an illusion, and that future researches, as they have repeatedly\r\n     before, so may now fail to substantiate this noble result. But I\r\n     confess myself unequal to such prudence under such excitement. Let\r\n     us rather accept the joyful omens of the time, and trust that, as\r\n     the barrier has begun to yield, it will speedily be effectually\r\n     prostrated.\"\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, it will be convenient to explain briefly how\r\nthe distance of a star can be measured. The problem is one of a wholly\r\ndifferent character from that of the sun's distance, which we have\r\nalready discussed in these pages. The observations for the determination\r\nof stellar parallax are founded on the familiar truth that the earth\r\nrevolves around the sun. We may for our present purpose assume that the\r\nearth revolves in a circular path. The centre of that path is at the\r\ncentre of the sun, and the radius of the path is 92,900,000 miles. Owing\r\nto our position on the earth, we observe the stars from a point of view\r\nwhich is constantly changing. In summer the earth is 185,800,000 miles\r\ndistant from the position which it occupied in winter. It follows that\r\nthe apparent positions of the stars, as projected on the background of\r\nthe sky, must present corresponding changes. We do not now mean that the\r\nactual positions of the stars are really displaced. The changes are only\r\napparent, and while oblivious of our own motion, which produces the\r\ndisplacements, we attribute the changes to the stars.\r\n\r\nOn the diagram in Fig. 93 is an ellipse with certain months--viz.,\r\nJanuary, April, July, October--marked upon its circumference. This\r\nellipse may be regarded as a miniature picture of the earth's orbit\r\naround the sun. In January the earth is at the spot so marked; in April\r\nit has moved a quarter of the whole journey; and so on round the whole\r\ncircle, returning to its original position in the course of one year.\r\nWhen we look from the position of the earth in January, we see the star\r\nA projected against the point of the sky marked 1. Three months later\r\nthe observer with his telescope is carried round to April; but he now\r\nsees the star projected to the position marked 2. Thus, as the observer\r\nmoves around the whole orbit in the annual revolution of the earth, so\r\nthe star appears to move round in an ellipse on the background of the\r\nsky. In the technical language of astronomers, we speak of this as the\r\nparallactic ellipse, and it is by measuring the major axis of this\r\nellipse that we determine the distance of the star from the sun. Half of\r\nthis major axis, or, what comes to the same thing, the angle which the\r\nradius of the earth's orbit subtends as seen from the star, is called\r\nthe star's \"annual parallax.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--The Parallactic Ellipse.]\r\n\r\nThe figure shows another star, B, more distant from the earth and the\r\nsolar system generally than the star previously considered. This star\r\nalso describes an elliptic path. We cannot, however, fail to notice that\r\nthe parallactic ellipse belonging to B is much smaller than that of A.\r\nThe difference in the sizes of the ellipses arises from the different\r\ndistances of the stars from the earth. The nearer the star is to the\r\nearth the greater is the ellipse, so that the nearest star in the\r\nheavens will describe the largest ellipse, while the most distant star\r\nwill describe the smallest ellipse. We thus see that the distance of the\r\nstar is inversely proportional to the size of the ellipse, and if we\r\nmeasure the angular value of the major axis of the ellipse, then, by an\r\nexceedingly simple mathematical manipulation, the distance of the star\r\ncan be expressed as a multiple of a radius of the earth's orbit.\r\nAssuming that radius to be 92,900,000 miles, the distance of the star is\r\nobtained by simple arithmetic. The difficulty in the process arises from\r\nthe fact that these ellipses are so small that our micrometers often\r\nfail to detect them.\r\n\r\nHow shall we adequately describe the extreme minuteness of the\r\nparallactic ellipses in the case of even the nearest stars? In the\r\ntechnical language of astronomers, we may state that the longest\r\ndiameter of the ellipse never subtends an angle of more than one and a\r\nhalf seconds. In a somewhat more popular manner, we would say that one\r\nthousand times the major axis of the very largest parallactic ellipse\r\nwould not be as great as the diameter of the full moon. For a still more\r\nsimple illustration, let us endeavour to think of a penny-piece placed\r\nat a distance of two miles. If looked at edgeways it will be linear, if\r\ntilted a little it would be elliptic; but the ellipse would, even at\r\nthat distance, be greater than the greatest parallactic ellipse of any\r\nstar in the sky. Suppose a sphere described around an observer, with a\r\nradius of two miles. If a penny-piece were placed on this sphere, in\r\nfront of each of the stars, every parallactic ellipse would be totally\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nThe star in the Swan known as 61 Cygni is not remarkable either for its\r\nsize or for its brightness. It is barely visible to the unaided eye, and\r\nthere are some thousands of stars which are apparently larger and\r\nbrighter. It is, however, a very interesting example of that remarkable\r\nclass of objects known as double stars. It consists of two nearly equal\r\nstars close together, and evidently connected by a bond of mutual\r\nattraction. The attention of astronomers is also specially directed\r\ntowards the star by its large proper motion. In virtue of that proper\r\nmotion, the two components are carried together over the sky at the rate\r\nof five seconds annually. A proper motion of this magnitude is extremely\r\nrare, yet we do not say it is unparalleled, for there are some few stars\r\nwhich have a proper motion even more rapid; but the remarkable duplex\r\ncharacter of 61 Cygni, combined with the large proper motion, render it\r\nan unique object, at all events, in the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nWhen Bessel proposed to undertake the great research with which his name\r\nwill be for ever connected, he determined to devote one, or two, or\r\nthree years to the continuous observations of one star, with the view of\r\nmeasuring carefully its parallactic ellipse. How was he to select the\r\nobject on which so much labour was to be expended? It was all-important\r\nto choose a star which should prove sufficiently near to reward his\r\nefforts by exhibiting a measurable parallax. Yet he could have but\r\nlittle more than surmise and analogy as a guide. It occurred to him that\r\nthe exceptional features of 61 Cygni afforded the necessary presumption,\r\nand he determined to apply the process of observation to this star. He\r\ndevoted the greater part of three years to the work, and succeeded in\r\ndiscovering its distance from the earth.\r\n\r\nSince the date of Sir John Herschel's address, 61 Cygni has received the\r\ndevoted and scarcely remitted attention of astronomers. In fact, we\r\nmight say that each succeeding generation undertakes a new discussion of\r\nthe distance of this star, with the view of confirming or of criticising\r\nthe original discovery of Bessel. The diagram here given (Fig. 94) is\r\nintended to illustrate the recent history of 61 Cygni.\r\n\r\nWhen Bessel engaged in his labours, the pair of stars forming the double\r\nwere at the point indicated on the diagram by the date 1838. The next\r\nepoch occurred fifteen years later, when Otto Struve undertook his\r\nresearches, and the pair of stars had by that time moved to the\r\nposition marked 1853. Finally, when the same object was more recently\r\nobserved at Dunsink Observatory, the pair had made still another\r\nadvance, to the position indicated by the date 1878. Thus, in forty\r\nyears this double star had moved over an arc of the heavens upwards of\r\nthree minutes in length. The actual path is, indeed, more complicated\r\nthan a simple rectilinear movement. The two stars which form the double\r\nhave a certain relative velocity, in consequence of their mutual\r\nattraction. It will not, however, be necessary to take this into\r\naccount, as the displacement thus arising in the lapse of a single year\r\nis far too minute to produce any inconvenient effect on the parallactic\r\nellipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--61 Cygni and the Comparison Stars.]\r\n\r\nThe case of 61 Cygni is, however, exceptional. It is one of our nearest\r\nneighbours in the heavens. We can never find its distance accurately to\r\none or two billions of miles; but still we have a consciousness that an\r\nuncertainty amounting to twenty billions is too large a percentage of\r\nthe whole. We shall presently show that we believe Struve was right,\r\nyet it does not necessarily follow that Bessel was wrong. The apparent\r\nparadox can be easily explained. It would not be easily explained if\r\nStruve had used the _same comparison star_ as Bessel had done; but\r\nStruve's comparison star was different from either of Bessel's, and this\r\nis probably the cause of the discrepancy. It will be recollected that\r\nthe essence of the process consists of the comparison of the small\r\nellipse made by the distant star with the larger ellipse made by the\r\nnearer star. If the two stars were at the same distance, the process\r\nwould be wholly inapplicable. In such a case, no matter how near the\r\nstars were to the earth, no parallax could be detected. For the method\r\nto be completely successful, the comparison star should be at least\r\neight times as far as the principal star. Bearing this in mind, it is\r\nquite possible to reconcile the measures of Bessel with those of Struve.\r\nWe need only assume that Bessel's comparison stars are about three times\r\nas far as 61 Cygni, while Struve's comparison star is at least eight or\r\nten times as far. We may add that, as the comparison stars used by\r\nBessel are brighter than that of Struve, there really is a presumption\r\nthat the latter is the most distant of the three.\r\n\r\nWe have here a characteristic feature of this method of determining\r\nparallax. Even if all the observations and the reductions of a parallax\r\nseries were mathematically correct, we could not with strict propriety\r\ndescribe the final result as the parallax of one star. It is only the\r\n_difference_ between the parallax of the star and that of the comparison\r\nstar. We can therefore only assert that the parallax sought cannot be\r\nless than the quantity determined. Viewed in this manner, the\r\ndiscrepancy between Struve and Bessel vanishes. Bessel asserted that the\r\ndistance of 61 Cygni could not be _more_ than sixty billions of miles.\r\nStruve did not contradict this--nay, he certainly confirmed it--when he\r\nshowed that the distance could not be more than forty billions.\r\n\r\nNearly half a century has elapsed since Struve made his observations.\r\nThose observations have certainly been challenged; but they are, on the\r\nwhole, confirmed by other investigations. In a critical review of the\r\nsubject Auwers showed that Struve's determination is worthy of\r\nconsiderable confidence. Yet, notwithstanding this authoritative\r\nannouncement, the study of 61 Cygni has been repeatedly resumed. Dr.\r\nBrünnow, when Astronomer Royal of Ireland, commenced a series of\r\nobservations on the parallax of 61 Cygni, which were continued and\r\ncompleted by the present writer, his successor. Brünnow chose a fourth\r\ncomparison star (marked on the diagram), different from any of those\r\nwhich had been used by the earlier observers. The method of observing\r\nwhich Brünnow employed was quite different from that of Struve, though\r\nthe filar micrometer was used in both cases. Brünnow sought to determine\r\nthe parallactic ellipse by measuring the difference in declination\r\nbetween 61 Cygni and the comparison star.[38] In the course of a year it\r\nis found that the difference in declination undergoes a periodic change,\r\nand from that change the parallactic ellipse can be computed. In the\r\nfirst series of observations I measured the difference of declination\r\nbetween the preceding star of 61 Cygni and the comparison star; in the\r\nsecond series I took the other component of 61 Cygni and the same\r\ncomparison star. We had thus two completely independent determinations\r\nof the parallax resulting from two years' work. The first of these makes\r\nthe distance forty billions of miles, and the second makes it almost\r\nexactly the same. There can be no doubt that this work supports Struve's\r\ndetermination in correction of Bessel's, and therefore we may perhaps\r\nsum up the present state of our knowledge of this question by saying\r\nthat the distance of 61 Cygni is much nearer to the forty billions of\r\nmiles which Struve found than to the sixty billions which Bessel\r\nfound.[39]\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to give the reader the means of forming his own opinion\r\nas to the quality of the evidence which is available in such researches.\r\nThe diagram in Fig. 95 here shown has been constructed with this object.\r\nIt is intended to illustrate the second series of observations of\r\ndifference of declination which I made at Dunsink. Each of the dots\r\nrepresents one night's observations. The height of the dot is the\r\nobserved difference of declination between 61 (B) Cygni and the\r\ncomparison star. The distance along the horizontal line--or the\r\nabscissa, as a mathematician would call it--represents the date. These\r\nobservations are grouped more or less regularly in the vicinity of a\r\ncertain curve. That curve expresses where the observations should have\r\nbeen, had they been absolutely perfect. The distances between the dots\r\nand the curve may be regarded as the errors which have been committed in\r\nmaking the observations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--Parallax in Declination of 61 Cygni.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be thought that in many cases these errors appear to\r\nhave attained very undesirable dimensions. Let us, therefore, hasten to\r\nsay that it was precisely for the purpose of setting forth these errors\r\nthat this diagram has been shown; we have to exhibit the weakness of the\r\ncase no less than its strength. The errors of the observations are not,\r\nhowever, intrinsically so great as might at first sight be imagined. To\r\nperceive this, it is only necessary to interpret the scale on which this\r\ndiagram has been drawn by comparison with familiar standards. The\r\ndistance from the very top of the curve to the horizontal line denotes\r\nan angle of only four-tenths of a second. This is about the apparent\r\ndiameter of a penny-piece at a distance of _ten miles_! We can now\r\nappraise the true magnitude of the errors which have been made. It will\r\nbe noticed that no one of the dots is distant from the curve by much\r\nmore than half of the height of the curve. It thus appears that the\r\ngreatest error in the whole series of observations amounts to but two or\r\nthree tenths of a second. This is equivalent to our having pointed the\r\ntelescope to the upper edge of a penny-piece fifteen or twenty miles\r\noff, instead of to the lower edge. This is not a great blunder. A rifle\r\nteam whose errors in pointing were more than a hundred times as great\r\nmight still easily win every prize at Bisley.\r\n\r\nWe have entered into the history of 61 Cygni with some detail, because\r\nit is the star whose distance has been most studied. We do not say that\r\n61 Cygni is the nearest of all the stars; it would, indeed, be very rash\r\nto assert that any particular star was the nearest of all the countless\r\nmillions in the heavenly host. We certainly know one star which seems\r\nnearer than 61 Cygni; it lies in one of the southern constellations, and\r\nits name is a Centauri. This star is, indeed, of memorable\r\ninterest in the history of the subject. Its parallax was first\r\ndetermined at the Cape of Good Hope by Henderson; subsequent researches\r\nhave confirmed his observations, and the elaborate investigations of Dr.\r\nGill have proved that the parallax of this star is about three-quarters\r\nof a second, so that it is only two-thirds of the distance of 61 Cygni.\r\n\r\n61 Cygni arrested our attention, in the first instance, by the\r\ncircumstance that it had the large proper motion of five seconds\r\nannually. We have also ascertained that the annual parallax is about\r\nhalf a second. The combination of these two statements leads to a result\r\nof considerable interest. It teaches us that 61 Cygni must each year\r\ntraverse a distance of not less than ten times the radius of the earth's\r\norbit. Translating this into ordinary figures, we learn that this star\r\nmust travel nine hundred and twenty million miles per annum. It must\r\nmove between two and three million miles each day, but this can only be\r\naccomplished by maintaining the prodigious velocity of thirty miles per\r\nsecond. There seems to be no escape from this conclusion. The facts\r\nwhich we have described, and which are now sufficiently well\r\nestablished, are inconsistent with the supposition that the velocity of\r\n61 Cygni is less than thirty miles per second; the velocity may be\r\ngreater, but less it cannot be.\r\n\r\nFor the last hundred and fifty years we know that 61 Cygni has been\r\nmoving in the same direction and with the same velocity. Prior to the\r\nexistence of the telescope we have no observation to guide us; we\r\ncannot, therefore, be absolutely certain as to the earlier history of\r\nthis star, yet it is only reasonable to suppose that 61 Cygni has been\r\nmoving from remote antiquity with a velocity comparable with that it has\r\nat present. If disturbing influences were entirely absent, there could\r\nbe no trace of doubt about the matter. _Some_ disturbing influence,\r\nhowever, there must be; the only question is whether that disturbing\r\ninfluence is sufficient to modify seriously the assumption we have made.\r\nA powerful disturbing influence might greatly alter the velocity of the\r\nstar; it might deflect the star from its rectilinear course; it might\r\neven force the star to move around a closed orbit. We do not, however,\r\nbelieve that any disturbing influence of this magnitude need be\r\ncontemplated, and there can be no reasonable doubt that 61 Cygni moves\r\nat present in a path very nearly straight, and with a velocity very\r\nnearly uniform.\r\n\r\nAs the distance of 61 Cygni from the sun is forty billions of miles, and\r\nits velocity is thirty miles a second, it is easy to find how long the\r\nstar would take to accomplish a journey equal to its distance from the\r\nsun. The time required will be about 40,000 years. In the last 400,000\r\nyears 61 Cygni will have moved over a distance ten times as great as\r\nits present distance from the sun, whatever be the direction of motion.\r\nThis star must therefore have been about ten times as far from the earth\r\n400,000 years ago as it is at present. Though this epoch is incredibly\r\nmore remote than any historical record, it is perhaps not incomparable\r\nwith the duration of the human race; while compared with the vast lapse\r\nof geological time, such periods seem trivial and insignificant.\r\nGeologists have long ago repudiated mere thousands of years; they now\r\nclaim millions, and many millions of years, for the performance of\r\ngeological phenomena. If the earth has existed for the millions of years\r\nwhich geologists assert, it becomes reasonable for astronomers to\r\nspeculate on the phenomena which have transpired in the heavens in the\r\nlapse of similar ages. By the aid of our knowledge of star distances,\r\ncombined with an assumed velocity of thirty miles per second, we can\r\nmake the attempt to peer back into the remote past, and show how great\r\nare the changes which our universe seems to have undergone.\r\n\r\nIn a million years 61 Cygni will apparently have moved through a\r\ndistance which is twenty-five times as great as its present distance\r\nfrom the sun. Whatever be the direction in which 61 Cygni is\r\nmoving--whether it be towards the earth or from the earth, to the right\r\nor to the left, it must have been about twenty-five times as far off a\r\nmillion years ago as it is at present; but even at its present distance\r\n61 Cygni is a small star; were it ten times as far it could only be seen\r\nwith a good telescope; were it twenty-five times as far it would barely\r\nbe a visible point in our greatest telescopes.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions arrived at with regard to 61 Cygni may be applied with\r\nvarying degrees of emphasis to other stars. We are thus led to the\r\nconclusion that many of the stars with which the heavens are strewn are\r\napparently in slow motion. But this motion though apparently slow may\r\nreally be very rapid. When standing on the sea-shore, and looking at a\r\nsteamer on the distant horizon, we can hardly notice that the steamer is\r\nmoving. It is true that by looking again in a few minutes we can detect\r\na change in its place; but the motion of the steamer seems slow. Yet if\r\nwe were near the steamer we would find that it was rushing along at the\r\nrate of many miles an hour. It is the distance which causes the\r\nillusion. So it is with the stars: they seem to move slowly because they\r\nare very distant, but were we near them, we could see that in the\r\nmajority of cases their motions are a thousand times as fast as the\r\nquickest steamer that ever ploughed the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the permanence of the sidereal heavens, and the\r\nfixity of the constellations in their relative positions, are only\r\nephemeral. When we rise to the contemplation of such vast periods of\r\ntime as the researches of geology disclose, the durability of the\r\nconstellations vanishes! In the lapse of those stupendous ages stars and\r\nconstellations gradually dissolve from view, to be replaced by others of\r\nno greater permanence.\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently happens that a parallax research proves abortive.\r\nThe labour has been finished, the observations are reduced and\r\ndiscussed, and yet no value of the parallax can be obtained. The\r\ndistance of the star is so vast that our base-line, although it is\r\nnearly two hundred millions of miles long, is too short to bear any\r\nappreciable ratio to the distance of the star. Even from such failures,\r\nhowever, information may often be drawn.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate this by an account derived from my own experience at\r\nDunsink. We have already mentioned that on the 24th November, 1876, a\r\nwell-known astronomer--Dr. Schmidt, of Athens--noticed a new bright star\r\nof the third magnitude in the constellation Cygnus. On the 20th of\r\nNovember Nova Cygni was invisible. Whether it first burst forth on the\r\n21st, 22nd, or 23rd no one can tell; but on the 24th it was discovered.\r\nIts brilliancy even then seemed to be waning; so, presumably, it was\r\nbrightest at some moment between the 20th and 24th of November. The\r\noutbreak must thus have been comparatively sudden, and we know of no\r\ncause which would account for such a phenomenon more simply than a\r\ngigantic collision. The decline in the brilliancy was much more tardy\r\nthan its growth, and more than a fortnight passed before the star\r\nrelapsed into insignificance--two or three days (or less) for the rise,\r\ntwo or three weeks for the fall. Yet even two or three weeks was a short\r\ntime in which to extinguish so mighty a conflagration. It is\r\ncomparatively easy to suggest an explanation of the sudden outbreak; it\r\nis not equally easy to understand how it can have been subdued in a few\r\nweeks. A good-sized iron casting in one of our foundries takes nearly as\r\nmuch time to cool as sufficed to abate the celestial fires in Nova\r\nCygni!\r\n\r\nOn this ground it seemed not unreasonable to suppose that perhaps Nova\r\nCygni was not really a very extensive conflagration. But, if such were\r\nthe case, the star must have been comparatively _near_ to the earth,\r\nsince it presented so brilliant a spectacle and attracted so much\r\nattention. It therefore appeared a plausible object for a parallax\r\nresearch; and consequently a series of observations were made some years\r\nago at Dunsink. I was at the time too much engaged with other work to\r\ndevote very much labour to a research which might, after all, only prove\r\nillusory. I simply made a sufficient number of micrometric measurements\r\nto test whether a _large_ parallax existed. It has been already pointed\r\nout how each star appears to describe a minute parallactic ellipse, in\r\nconsequence of the annual motion of the earth, and by measurement of\r\nthis ellipse the parallax--and therefore the distance--of the star can\r\nbe determined. In ordinary circumstances, when the parallax of a star is\r\nbeing investigated, it is necessary to measure the position of the star\r\nin its ellipse on many different occasions, distributed over a period of\r\nat least an entire year. The method we adopted was much less laborious.\r\nIt was sufficiently accurate to test whether or not Nova Cygni had a\r\n_large_ parallax, though it might not have been delicate enough to\r\ndisclose a small parallax. At a certain date, which can be readily\r\ncomputed, the star is at one end of the parallactic ellipse, and six\r\nmonths later the star is at the other end. By choosing suitable times in\r\nthe year for our observations, we can measure the star in those two\r\npositions when it is most deranged by parallax. It was by observations\r\nof this kind that I sought to detect the parallax of Nova Cygni. Its\r\ndistance from a neighbouring star was carefully measured by the\r\nmicrometer at the two seasons when, if parallax existed, those distances\r\nshould show their greatest discrepancy; but no certain difference\r\nbetween these distances could be detected. The observations, therefore,\r\nfailed to reveal the existence of a parallactic ellipse--or, in other\r\nwords, the distance of Nova Cygni was too great to be measured by\r\nobservations of this kind.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that if Nova Cygni had been one of the nearest stars these\r\nobservations would not have been abortive. We are therefore entitled to\r\nbelieve that Nova Cygni must be at least 20,000,000,000,000 miles from\r\nthe solar system; and the suggestion that the brilliant outburst was of\r\nsmall dimensions must, it seems, be abandoned. The intrinsic brightness\r\nof Nova Cygni, when at its best, cannot have been greatly if at all\r\ninferior to the brilliancy of our sun himself. If the sun were withdrawn\r\nfrom us to the distance of Nova Cygni, it would seemingly have dwindled\r\ndown to an object not more brilliant than the variable star. How the\r\nlustre of such a stupendous object declined so rapidly remains,\r\ntherefore, a mystery not easy to explain. Have we not said that the\r\noutbreak of brilliancy in this star occurred between the 20th and the\r\n24th of November, 1876? It would be more correct to say that the tidings\r\nof that outbreak reached our system at the time referred to. The real\r\noutbreak must have taken place at least three years previously. Indeed,\r\nat the time that the star excited such commotion in the astronomical\r\nworld here, it had already relapsed again into insignificance.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the subject of the present chapter we have to\r\nconsider a great problem which was proposed by Sir William Herschel. He\r\nsaw that the stars were animated by proper motion; he saw also that the\r\nsun is a star, one of the countless host of heaven, and he was therefore\r\nled to propound the stupendous question as to whether the sun, like the\r\nother stars which are its peers, was also in motion. Consider all that\r\nthis great question involves. The sun has around it a retinue of\r\nplanets and their attendant satellites, the comets, and a host of\r\nsmaller bodies. The question is, whether all this superb system is\r\nrevolving around the sun _at rest_ in the middle, or whether the whole\r\nsystem--sun, planets, and all--is not moving on bodily through space.\r\n\r\nHerschel was the first to solve this noble problem; he discovered that\r\nour sun and the splendid retinue by which it is attended are moving in\r\nspace. He not only discovered this, but he ascertained the direction in\r\nwhich the system was moving, as well as the approximate velocity with\r\nwhich that movement was probably performed. It has been shown that the\r\nsun and his system is now hastening towards a point of the heavens near\r\nthe constellation Lyra. The velocity with which the motion is performed\r\ncorresponds to the magnitude of the system; quicker than the swiftest\r\nrifle-bullet that was ever fired, the sun, bearing with it the earth and\r\nall the other planets, is now sweeping onwards. We on the earth\r\nparticipate in that motion. Every half hour we are something like ten\r\nthousand miles nearer to the constellation of Lyra than we should have\r\nbeen if the solar system were not animated by this motion. As we are\r\nproceeding at this stupendous rate towards Lyra, it might at first be\r\nsupposed that we ought soon to get there; but the distances of the stars\r\nin that neighbourhood seem not less than those of the stars elsewhere,\r\nand we may be certain that the sun and his system must travel at the\r\npresent rate for far more than a million years before we have crossed\r\nthe abyss between our present position and the frontiers of Lyra. It\r\nmust, however, be acknowledged that our estimate of the actual _speed_\r\nwith which our solar system is travelling is exceedingly uncertain, but\r\nthis does not in the least affect the fact that we are moving in the\r\ndirection first approximately indicated by Herschel (_see_ Chapter\r\nXXIII.).\r\n\r\nIt remains to explain the method of reasoning which Herschel adopted, by\r\nwhich he was able to make this great discovery. It may sound strange to\r\nhear that the detection of the motion of the sun was not made by looking\r\nat the sun; all the observations of the luminary itself with all the\r\ntelescopes in the world would never tell us of that motion, for the\r\nsimple reason that the earth, whence our observations must be made,\r\nparticipates in it. A passenger in the cabin of a ship usually becomes\r\naware that the ship is moving by the roughness of the sea; but if the\r\nsea be perfectly calm, then, though the tables and chairs in the cabin\r\nare moving as rapidly as the ship, yet we do not see them moving,\r\nbecause we are also travelling with the ship. If we could not go out of\r\nthe cabin, nor look through the windows, we would never know whether the\r\nship was moving or at rest; nor could we have any idea as to the\r\ndirection in which the ship was going, or as to the velocity with which\r\nthat motion was performed.\r\n\r\nThe sun, with his attendant host of planets and satellites, may be\r\nlikened to the ship. The planets may revolve around the sun just as the\r\npassengers may move about in the cabin, but as the passengers, by\r\nlooking at objects on board, can never tell whither the ship is going,\r\nso we, by merely looking at the sun, or at the other planets or members\r\nof the solar system, can never tell if our system as a whole is in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of a perfectly uniform movement along a perfectly calm\r\nsea are not often fulfilled on the waters with which we are acquainted,\r\nbut the course of the sun and his system is untroubled by any\r\ndisturbance, so that the majestic progress is conducted with absolute\r\nuniformity. We do not feel the motion; and as all the planets are\r\ntravelling with us, we can get no information from them as to the common\r\nmotion by which the whole system is animated.\r\n\r\nThe passengers are, however, at once apprised of the ship's motion when\r\nthey go on deck, and when they look at the sea surrounding them. Let us\r\nsuppose that their voyage is nearly accomplished, that the distant land\r\nappears in sight, and, as evening approaches, the harbour is discerned\r\ninto which the ship is to enter. Let us suppose that the harbour has, as\r\nis often the case, a narrow entrance, and that its mouth is indicated by\r\na lighthouse on each side. When the harbour is still a long way off,\r\nnear the horizon, the two lights are seen close together, and now that\r\nthe evening has closed in, and the night has become quite dark, these\r\ntwo lights are all that remain visible. While the ship is still some\r\nmiles from its destination the two lights seem close together, but as\r\nthe distance decreases the two lights seem to open out; gradually the\r\nship gets nearer, while the lights are still opening, till finally, when\r\nthe ship enters the harbour, instead of the two lights being directly in\r\nfront, as at the commencement, one of the lights is passed by on the\r\nright hand, while the other is similarly found on the left. If, then, we\r\nare to discover the motion of the solar system, we must, like the\r\npassenger, look at objects unconnected with our system, and learn our\r\nown motion by their apparent movements. But are there any objects in the\r\nheavens unconnected with our system? If all the stars were like the\r\nearth, merely the appendages of our sun, then we never could discover\r\nwhether we were at rest or whether we were in motion: our system might\r\nbe in a condition of absolute rest, or it might be hurrying on with an\r\ninconceivably great velocity, for anything we could tell to the\r\ncontrary. But the stars do not belong to the system of our sun; they\r\nare, rather, suns themselves, and do not recognise the sway of our sun,\r\nas this earth is obliged to do. The stars will, therefore, act as the\r\nexternal objects by which we can test whether our system is voyaging\r\nthrough space.\r\n\r\nWith the stars as our beacons, what ought we to expect if our system be\r\nreally in motion? Remember that when the ship was approaching the\r\nharbour the lights gradually opened out to the right and left. But the\r\nastronomer has also lights by which he can observe the navigation of\r\nthat vast craft, our solar system, and these lights will indicate the\r\npath along which he is borne. If our solar system be in motion, we\r\nshould expect to find that the stars were gradually spreading away from\r\nthat point in the heavens towards which our motion tends. This is\r\nprecisely what we do find. The stars in the constellations are gradually\r\nspreading away from a central point near the constellation of Lyra, and\r\nhence we infer that it is towards Lyra that the motion of the solar\r\nsystem is directed.\r\n\r\nThere is one great difficulty in the discussion of this question. Have\r\nwe not had occasion to observe that the stars themselves are in actual\r\nmotion? It seems certain that every star, including the sun himself as a\r\nstar, has each an individual motion of its own. The motions of the stars\r\nas we see them are partly apparent as well as partly real; they partly\r\narise from the actual motion of each star and partly from the motion of\r\nthe sun, in which we partake, and which produces an apparent motion of\r\nthe star. How are these to be discriminated? Our telescopes and our\r\nobservations can never effect this decomposition directly. To accomplish\r\nthe analysis, Herschel resorted to certain geometrical methods. His\r\nmaterials at that time were but scanty, but in his hands they proved\r\nadequate, and he boldly announced his discovery of the movement of the\r\nsolar system.\r\n\r\nSo astounding an announcement demanded the severest test which the most\r\nrefined astronomical resources could suggest. There is a certain\r\npowerful and subtle method which astronomers use in the effort to\r\ninterpret nature. Bishop Butler has said that probability is the guide\r\nof life. The proper motion of a star has to be decomposed into two\r\nparts, one real and the other apparent. When several stars are taken, we\r\nmay conceive an infinite number of ways into which the movements of each\r\nstar can be so decomposed. Each one of these conceivable divisions will\r\nhave a certain element of probability in its favour. It is the business\r\nof the mathematician to determine the amount of that probability. The\r\ncase, then, is as follows:--Among all the various systems one must be\r\ntrue. We cannot lay our finger for certain on the true one, but we can\r\ntake that which has the highest degree of probability in its favour, and\r\nthus follow the precept of Butler to which we have already referred. A\r\nmathematician would describe his process by calling it the method of\r\nleast squares. Since Herschel's discovery, one hundred years ago, many\r\nan astronomer using observations of hundreds of stars has attacked the\r\nsame problem. Mathematicians have exhausted every refinement which the\r\ntheory of probabilities can afford, but only to confirm the truth of\r\nthat splendid theory which seems to have been one of the flashes of\r\nHerschel's genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSTAR CLUSTERS AND NEBULÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Interesting Sidereal Objects--Stars not Scattered uniformly--Star\r\n     Clusters--Their Varieties--The Cluster in Perseus--The Globular\r\n     Cluster in Hercules--The Milky Way--A Cluster of Minute Stars--The\r\n     Magellanic Clouds--Nebulæ distinct from Clouds--Number of known\r\n     Nebulæ--The Constellation of Orion--The Position of the Great\r\n     Nebula--The Wonderful Star th Orionis--The Drawing of the\r\n     Great Nebula in Lord Rosse's Telescope--Photographs of this\r\n     Wonderful Object--The Great Nebula in Andromeda--The Annular Nebula\r\n     in Lyra--Resemblance to Vortex Rings--Planetary Nebulæ--Drawings of\r\n     Several Remarkable Nebulæ--Nature of Nebulæ--Spectra of\r\n     Nebulæ--Their Distribution; the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned Saturn as one of the most glorious telescopic\r\nspectacles in the heavens. Setting aside the obvious claims of the sun\r\nand of the moon, there are, perhaps, two other objects visible from\r\nthese latitudes which rival Saturn in the splendour and the interest of\r\ntheir telescopic picture. One of these objects is the star cluster in\r\nHercules; the other is the great nebula in Orion. We take these objects\r\nas typical of the two great classes of bodies to be discussed in this\r\nchapter, under the head of Star Clusters and Nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThe stars, which to the number of several millions bespangle the sky,\r\nare not scattered uniformly. We can see that while some regions are\r\ncomparatively barren, others contain stars in profusion. Sometimes we\r\nhave a small group, like the Pleiades; sometimes we have a stupendous\r\nregion of the heavens strewn over with stars, as in the Milky Way. Such\r\nobjects are called star clusters. We find every variety in the clusters;\r\nsometimes the stars are remarkable for their brilliancy, sometimes for\r\ntheir enormous numbers, and sometimes for the remarkable form in which\r\nthey are grouped. Sometimes a star cluster is adorned with\r\nbrilliantly-coloured stars; sometimes the luminous points are so close\r\ntogether that their separate rays cannot he disentangled; sometimes the\r\nstars are so minute or so distant that the cluster is barely\r\ndistinguishable from a nebula.\r\n\r\nOf the clusters remarkable at once both for richness and brilliancy of\r\nthe individual stars, we may mention the cluster in the Sword-handle of\r\nPerseus. The position of this object is marked on Fig. 83, page 415. To\r\nthe unaided eye a hazy spot is visible, which in the telescope expands\r\ninto two clusters separated by a short distance. In each of them we have\r\ninnumerable stars, crowded together so as to fill the field of view of\r\nthe telescope. The splendour of this object may be appreciated when we\r\nreflect that each one of these stars is itself a brilliant sun, perhaps\r\nrivalling our own sun in lustre. There are, however, regions in the\r\nheavens near the Southern Cross, of course invisible from northern\r\nlatitudes, in which parts of the Milky Way present a richer appearance\r\neven than the cluster in Perseus.\r\n\r\nThe most striking type of star cluster is well exhibited in the\r\nconstellation of Hercules. In this case we have a group of minute stars\r\napparently in a roughly globular form. Fig. 96 represents this object as\r\nseen in Lord Rosse's great telescope, and it shows three radiating\r\nstreaks, in which the stars seem less numerous than elsewhere. It is\r\nestimated that this cluster must contain from 1,000 to 2,000 stars, all\r\nconcentrated into an extremely small part of the heavens. Viewed in a\r\nvery small telescope, this object resembles a nebula. The position of\r\nthe cluster in Hercules is shown in a diagram previously given (Fig. 88,\r\npage 420). We have already referred to this glorious aggregation of\r\nstars as one of the three especially interesting objects in the heavens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE D.\r\n\r\nMILKY WAY NEAR MESSIER II.\r\n\r\n_Photographed by E.E. Barnard, 29th June, 1892._]\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way forms a girdle which, with more or less regularity,\r\nsweeps completely around the heavens; and when viewed with the\r\ntelescope, is seen to consist of myriads of minute stars. In some places\r\nthe stars are much more numerous than elsewhere. All these stars are\r\nincomparably more distant than the sun, which they surround, so it is\r\nevident that our sun and, of course, the system which attends him lie\r\nactually inside the Milky Way. It seems tempting to pursue the thought\r\nhere suggested, and to reflect that the whole Milky Way may, after all,\r\nbe merely a star cluster, comparable in size with some of the other star\r\nclusters which we see, and that, viewed from a remote point in space,\r\nthe Milky Way would seem to be but one of the many clusters of stars\r\ncontaining our sun as an indistinguishable unit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--The Globular Cluster in Hercules.]\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere there are two immense masses which are\r\nconspicuously visible to the naked eye, and resemble detached portions\r\nof the Milky Way. They cannot be seen by observers in our latitude, and\r\nare known as the Magellanic clouds or the two nubeculæ. Their structure,\r\nas revealed to an observer using a powerful telescope, is of great\r\ncomplexity. Sir John Herschel, who made a special study of these\r\nremarkable objects, gives the following description of them: \"The\r\ngeneral ground of both consists of large tracts and patches of\r\nnebulosity in every stage of resolution, from light irresolvable, in a\r\nreflector of eighteen inches aperture, up to perfectly separated stars\r\nlike the Milky Way, and clustering groups sufficiently insulated and\r\ncondensed to come under the designation of irregular and in some cases\r\npretty rich clusters. But besides these there are also nebulæ in\r\nabundance and globular clusters in every state of condensation.\" It can\r\nhardly be doubted that the two nubeculæ, which are, roughly speaking,\r\nround, or, rather, oval, are not formed accidentally by a vast number of\r\nvery different objects being ranged at various distances along the same\r\nline of sight, but that they really represent two great systems of\r\nobjects, widely different in constitution, which here are congregated in\r\neach other's neighbourhood, whereas they generally do not co-exist close\r\nto each other in the Milky Way, with which the mere naked-eye view would\r\notherwise lead us to associate the Magellanic clouds.\r\n\r\nWhen we direct a good telescope to the heavens, we shall occasionally\r\nmeet with one of the remarkable celestial objects which are known as\r\nnebulæ. They are faint cloudy spots, or stains of light on the black\r\nbackground of the sky. They are nearly all invisible to the naked eye.\r\nThese celestial objects must not for a moment be confounded with clouds,\r\nin the ordinary meaning of the word. The latter exist only suspended in\r\nthe atmosphere, while nebulæ are immersed in the depths of space. Clouds\r\nshine by the light of the sun, which they reflect to us; nebulæ shine\r\nwith no borrowed light; they are self-luminous. Clouds change from hour\r\nto hour; nebulæ do not change even from year to year. Clouds are far\r\nsmaller than the earth; while the smallest nebula known to us is\r\nincomparably greater than the sun. Clouds are within a few miles of the\r\nearth; the nebulæ are almost inconceivably remote.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Herschel and his sister had settled at Slough he\r\ncommenced his review of the northern heavens in a systematic manner. For\r\nobservations of this kind it is essential that the sky be free from\r\ncloud, while even the light of the moon is sufficient to obliterate the\r\nfainter and more interesting objects. It was in the long and fine\r\nwinter nights, when the stars were shining brilliantly and the pale path\r\nof the Milky Way extended across the heavens, that the labour was to be\r\ndone. The telescope being directed to the heavens, the ordinary diurnal\r\nmotion by which the sun and stars appear to rise and set carries the\r\nstars across the field of view in a majestic panorama. The stars enter\r\nslowly into the field of view, slowly move across it, and slowly leave\r\nit, to be again replaced by others. Thus the observer, by merely\r\nremaining passive at the eye-piece, sees one field after another pass\r\nbefore him, and is enabled to examine their contents. It follows, that\r\neven without moving the telescope a long narrow strip of the heavens is\r\nbrought under review, and by moving the telescope slightly up and down\r\nthe width of this strip can be suitably increased. On another night the\r\ntelescope is brought into a different position, and another strip of the\r\nsky is examined; so that in the course of time the whole heavens can be\r\ncarefully scrutinised.\r\n\r\nHerschel stands at the eye-piece to watch the glorious procession of\r\ncelestial objects. Close by, his sister Caroline sits at her desk, pen\r\nin hand, to take down the observations as they fall from her brother's\r\nlips. In front of her is a chronometer from which she can note the time,\r\nand a contrivance which indicates the altitude of the telescope, so that\r\nshe can record the exact position of the object in connection with the\r\ndescription which her brother dictated. Such was the splendid scheme\r\nwhich this brother and sister had arranged to carry out as the object of\r\ntheir life-long devotion. The discoveries which Herschel was destined to\r\nmake were to be reckoned not by tens or by hundreds, but by thousands.\r\nThe records of these discoveries are to be found in the \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society,\" and they are among the richest\r\ntreasures of those volumes. It was left to Sir John Herschel, the only\r\nson of Sir William, to complete his father's labour by repeating the\r\nsurvey of the northern heavens and extending it to the southern\r\nhemisphere. He undertook with this object a journey to the Cape of Good\r\nHope, and sojourned there for the years necessary to complete the great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--The Constellation of Orion, showing the\r\nPosition of the Great Nebula.]\r\n\r\nAs the result of the gigantic labours thus inaugurated and continued by\r\nother observers, there are now about eight thousand nebulæ known to us,\r\nand with every improvement of the telescope fresh additions are being\r\nmade to the list. They differ from one another as eight thousand pebbles\r\nselected at random on a sea-beach might differ--namely, in form, size,\r\ncolour, and material--but yet, like the pebbles, bear a certain generic\r\nresemblance to each other. To describe this class of bodies in any\r\ndetail would altogether exceed the limits of this chapter; we shall\r\nmerely select a few of the nebulæ, choosing naturally those of the most\r\nremarkable character, and also those which are representatives of the\r\ndifferent groups into which nebulæ may be divided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NEBULA IN ORION.]\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the great nebula in the constellation of\r\nOrion is one of the most interesting objects in the heavens. It is alike\r\nremarkable whether we consider its size or its brilliancy, the care with\r\nwhich it has been studied, or the success which has attended the efforts\r\nto learn something of its character. To find this object, we refer to\r\nFig. 97 for the sketch of the chief stars in this constellation, where\r\nthe letter A indicates the middle one of the three stars which form the\r\nsword-handle of Orion. Above the handle will be seen the three stars\r\nwhich form the well-known belt so conspicuous in the wintry sky. The\r\nstar A, when viewed attentively with the unaided eye, presents a\r\nsomewhat misty appearance. In the year 1618 Cysat directed a telescope\r\nto this star, and saw surrounding it a curious luminous haze, which\r\nproved to be the great nebula. Ever since his time this object has been\r\ndiligently studied by many astronomers, so that very many observations\r\nhave been made of the great nebula, and even whole volumes have been\r\nwritten which treat of nothing else. Any ordinary telescope will show\r\nthe object to some extent, but the more powerful the telescope the more\r\nare the curious details revealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--The Multiple star (th Orionis) in the\r\nGreat Nebula of Orion.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the object which we have denoted by A (th\r\nOrionis, also called the trapezium of Orion) is in itself the most\r\nstriking multiple star in the whole heavens. It consists really of six\r\nstars, represented in the next diagram (Fig. 98). These points are so\r\nclose together that their commingled rays cannot be distinguished\r\nwithout a telescope. Four of them are, however, easily seen in quite\r\nsmall instruments, but the two smaller stars require telescopes of\r\nconsiderable power. And yet these stars are suns, comparable, it may be,\r\nwith our sun in magnitude.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that this unrivalled group of six suns\r\nshould be surrounded by the renowned nebula; the nebula or the multiple\r\nstar would, either of them alone, be of exceptional interest, and here\r\nwe have a combination of the two. It seems impossible to resist drawing\r\nthe conclusion that the multiple star really lies in the nebula, and not\r\nmerely along the same line of vision. It would, indeed, seem to be at\r\nvariance with all probability to suppose that the presentation of these\r\ntwo exceptional objects in the same field of view was merely accidental.\r\nIf the multiple star be really in the nebula, then this object affords\r\nevidence that in one case at all events the distance of a nebula is a\r\nquantity of the same magnitude as the distance of a star. This is\r\nunhappily almost the entire extent of our knowledge of the distances of\r\nthe nebulæ from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe great nebula of Orion surrounds the multiple star, and extends out\r\nto a vast distance into the neighbouring space. The dotted circle drawn\r\naround the star marked A in Fig. 97 represents approximately the extent\r\nof the nebula, as seen in a moderately good telescope. The nebula is of\r\na faint bluish colour, impossible to represent in a drawing. Its\r\nbrightness is much greater in some places than in others; the central\r\nparts are, generally speaking, the most brilliant, and the luminosity\r\ngradually fades away as the edge of the nebula is approached. In fact,\r\nwe can hardly say that the nebula has any definite boundary, for with\r\neach increase of telescopic power faint new branches can be seen. There\r\nseems to be an empty space in the nebula immediately surrounding the\r\nmultiple star, but this is merely an illusion, produced by the contrast\r\nof the brilliant light of the stars, as the spectroscopic examination of\r\nthe nebula shows that the nebulous matter is continuous between the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nThe plate of the great nebula in Orion which is here shown (Plate XIV.)\r\nrepresents, in a reduced form, the elaborate drawing of this object,\r\nwhich has been made with the Earl of Rosse's great reflecting telescope\r\nat Parsonstown.[40] A telescopic view of the nebula shows two hundred\r\nstars or more, scattered over its surface. It is not necessary to\r\nsuppose that these stars are immersed in the substance of the nebula as\r\nthe multiple star appears to be; they may be either in front of it, or,\r\nless probably, behind it, so as to be projected on the same part of the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH OF THE NEBULA 31 M ANDROMEDÆ\r\n\r\nEXPOSURE 4 HOURS, ENLARGED 3 TIMES.\r\n\r\nTAKEN BY MR. ISAAC ROBERTS, 29 DECEMBER, 1882.]\r\n\r\nA considerable number of drawings of this unique object have been made\r\nby other astronomers. Among these we must mention that executed by\r\nProfessor Bond, in Cambridge, Mass., which possesses a faithfulness in\r\ndetail that every student of this object is bound to acknowledge. Of\r\nlate years also successful attempts have been made to photograph the\r\ngreat nebula. The late Professor Draper was fortunate enough to obtain\r\nsome admirable photographs. In England Mr. Common was the first to take\r\nmost excellent photographs of the nebula, and superb photographs of the\r\nsame object have also been obtained by Dr. Roberts and Mr. W.E. Wilson,\r\nwhich show a vast extension of the nebula into regions which it was not\r\npreviously known to occupy.\r\n\r\nThe great nebula in Andromeda, which is faintly visible to the unaided\r\neye, is shown in Plate XV., which has been copied with permission from\r\none of the astonishing photographs that Dr. Isaac Roberts has obtained.\r\nTwo dark channels in the nebula cannot fail to be noticed, and the\r\nnumber of faint stars scattered over its surface is also a point to\r\nwhich attention may be drawn. To find this object we must look out for\r\nCassiopeia and the Great Square of Pegasus, and then the nebula will be\r\neasily perceived in the position shown on p. 413. In the year 1885 a new\r\nstar of the seventh magnitude suddenly appeared close to the brightest\r\npart of the nebula, and declined again to invisibility after the lapse\r\nof a few months.\r\n\r\nThe nebula in Lyra is the most conspicuous ring nebula in the heavens,\r\nbut it is not to be supposed that it is the only member of this class.\r\nAltogether, there are about a dozen of these objects. It seems difficult\r\nto form any adequate conception of the nature of such a body. It is,\r\nhowever, impossible to view the annular nebulæ without being, at all\r\nevents, reminded of those elegant objects known as vortex rings. Who has\r\nnot noticed a graceful ring of steam which occasionally escapes from the\r\nfunnel of a locomotive, and ascends high into the air, only dissolving\r\nsome time after the steam not so specialised has disappeared? Such\r\nvortex rings can be produced artificially by a cubical box, one open\r\nside of which is covered with canvas, while on the opposite side of the\r\nbox is a circular hole. A tap on the canvas will cause a vortex ring to\r\nstart from the hole; and if the box be filled with smoke, this ring will\r\nbe visible for many feet of its path. It would certainly be far too much\r\nto assert that the annular nebulæ have any real analogy to vortex rings;\r\nbut there is, at all events, no other object known to us with which they\r\ncan be compared.\r\n\r\nThe heavens contain a number of minute but brilliant objects known as\r\nthe planetary nebulæ. They can only be described as globes of glowing\r\nbluish-coloured gas, often small enough to be mistaken for a star when\r\nviewed through a telescope. One of the most remarkable of these objects\r\nlies in the constellation Draco, and can be found half-way between the\r\nPole Star and the star g Draconis. Some of the more recently\r\ndiscovered planetary nebulæ are extremely small, and they have indeed\r\nonly been distinguished from small stars by the spectroscope. It is also\r\nto be noticed that such objects are a little out of the stellar focus in\r\nthe refracting telescope in consequence of their blue colour. This\r\nremark does not apply to a reflecting telescope, as this instrument\r\nconducts all the rays to a common focus.\r\n\r\nThere are many other forms of nebulæ: there are long nebulous rays;\r\nthere are the wondrous spirals which have been disclosed in Lord Rosse's\r\ngreat reflector; there are the double nebulæ. But all these various\r\nobjects we must merely dismiss with this passing reference. There is a\r\ngreat difficulty in making pictorial representations of such nebulæ.\r\nMost of them are very faint--so faint, indeed, that they can only be\r\nseen with close attention even in powerful instruments. In making\r\ndrawings of these objects, therefore, it is impossible to avoid\r\nintensifying the fainter features if an intelligible picture is to be\r\nmade. With this caution, however, we present Plate XVI., which exhibits\r\nseveral of the more remarkable nebulæ as seen through Lord Rosse's great\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--The Nebula N.G.C., 1,499.\r\n\r\n(_By E.E. Barnard, Lick Observatory, September 21, 1895._)]\r\n\r\nThe actual nature of the nebulæ offers a problem of the greatest\r\ninterest, which naturally occupied the mind of the first assiduous\r\nobserver of nebulæ, William Herschel, for many years. At first he\r\nassumed all nebulæ to be nothing but dense aggregations of stars--a very\r\nnatural conclusion for one who had so greatly advanced the optical power\r\nof telescopes, and was accustomed to see many objects which in a small\r\ntelescope looked nebulous become \"resolved\" into stars when scrutinised\r\nwith a telescope of large aperture. But in 1864, when Sir William\r\nHuggins first directed a telescope armed with a spectroscope to one of\r\nthe planetary nebulæ, it became evident that at least some nebulæ were\r\nreally clouds of fiery mist and not star clusters.\r\n\r\nWe shall in our next chapter deal with the spectra of the fixed stars,\r\nbut we may here in anticipation remark that these spectra are\r\ncontinuous, generally showing the whole length of spectrum, from red to\r\nviolet, as in the sun's spectrum, though with many and important\r\ndifferences as to the presence of dark and bright lines. A star cluster\r\nmust, of course, give a similar spectrum, resulting from the\r\nsuperposition of the spectra of the single stars in the cluster. Many\r\nnebulæ give a spectrum of this kind; for instance, the great nebula in\r\nAndromeda. But it does not by any means follow from this that these\r\nobjects are only clusters of ordinary stars, as a continuous spectrum\r\nmay be produced not only by matter in the liquid or solid state, or by\r\ngases at high pressure, but also by gases at lower pressure but high\r\ntemperature under certain conditions. A continuous spectrum in the case\r\nof a nebula, therefore, need not indicate that the nebula is a cluster\r\nof bodies comparable in size and general constitution with our sun. But\r\nif a spectrum of bright lines is given by a nebula, we can be certain\r\nthat gases at low pressure are present in the object under examination.\r\nAnd this was precisely what Sir William Huggins discovered to be the\r\ncase in many nebulæ. When he first decided to study the spectra of\r\nnebulæ, he selected for observation those objects known as planetary\r\nnebulæ--small, round, or slightly oval discs, generally without central\r\ncondensation, and looking like ill-defined planets. The colour of their\r\nlight, which often is blue tinted with green, is remarkable, since this\r\nis a colour very rare among single stars. The spectrum was found to be\r\ntotally different to that of any star, consisting merely of three or\r\nfour bright lines. The brightest one is situated in the bluish-green\r\npart of the spectrum, and was at first thought to be identical with a\r\nline of the spectrum of nitrogen, but subsequent more accurate measures\r\nhave shown that neither this nor the second nebular line correspond to\r\nany dark line in the solar spectrum, nor can they be produced\r\nexperimentally in the laboratory, and we are therefore unable to ascribe\r\nthem to any known element. The third and fourth lines were at once seen\r\nto be identical with the two hydrogen lines which in the solar spectrum\r\nare named F and g.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE E.\r\n\r\nNEBULÆ IN THE PLEIADES.\r\n\r\n_From a Photograph by Dr. Isaac Roberts._]\r\n\r\nSpectrum analysis has here, as on so many other occasions, rendered\r\nservices which no telescope could ever have done. The spectra of nebulæ\r\nhave, after Huggins, been studied, both visually and photographically,\r\nby Vogel, Copeland, Campbell, Keeler, and others, and a great many very\r\nfaint lines have been detected in addition to those four which an\r\ninstrument of moderate dimensions shows. It is remarkable that the red\r\nC-line of hydrogen, ordinarily so bright, is either absent or\r\nexcessively faint in the spectra of nebulæ, but experiments by Frankland\r\nand Lockyer have shown that under certain conditions of temperature and\r\npressure the complicated spectrum of hydrogen is reduced to one green\r\nline, the F-line. It is, therefore, not surprising that the spectra of\r\ngaseous nebulæ are comparatively simple, as the probably low density of\r\nthe gases in them and the faintness of these bodies would tend to reduce\r\nthe spectra to a small number of lines. Some gaseous nebulæ also show\r\nfaint continuous spectra, the place of maximum brightness of which is\r\nnot in the yellow (as in the solar spectrum), but about the green. It is\r\nprobable that these continuous spectra are really an aggregate of very\r\nfaint luminous lines.\r\n\r\nA list of all the nebulæ known to have a gaseous spectrum would now\r\ncontain about eighty members. In addition to the planetary nebulæ, many\r\nlarge and more diffused nebulæ belong to this class, and this is also\r\nthe case with the annular nebula in Lyra and the great nebula of Orion.\r\nIt is needless to say that it is of special interest to find this grand\r\nobject enrolled among the nebulæ of a gaseous nature. In this nebula\r\nCopeland detected the wonderful D3 line of helium at a time when\r\n\"helium\" was a mere name, a hypothetical something, but which we now\r\nknow to be an element very widely distributed through the universe. It\r\nhas since been found in several other nebulæ. The ease with which the\r\ncharacteristic gaseous spectrum is recognised has suggested the idea of\r\nsweeping the sky with a spectroscope in order to pick up new planetary\r\nnebulæ, and a number of objects have actually been discovered by\r\nPickering and Copeland in this manner, as also more recently by\r\nPickering by examining spectrum photographs of various regions of the\r\nsky. Most of these new objects when seen through a telescope look like\r\nordinary stars, and their real nature could never have been detected\r\nwithout the spectroscope.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up at the starry sky on a clear night, the stars seem at\r\nfirst sight to be very irregularly distributed over the heavens. Here\r\nand there a few bright stars form characteristic groups, like Orion or\r\nthe Great Bear, while other equally large tracts are almost devoid of\r\nbright stars and only contain a few insignificant ones. If we take a\r\nbinocular, or other small telescope, and sweep the sky with it, the\r\nresult seems to be the same--now we come across spaces rich in stars;\r\nnow we meet with comparatively empty places. But when we approach the\r\nzone of the Milky Way, we are struck with the rapid increase of the\r\nnumber of stars which fill the field of the telescope; and when we reach\r\nthe Milky Way itself, the eye is almost unable to separate the single\r\npoints of light, which are packed so closely together that they produce\r\nthe appearance to the naked eye of a broad, but very irregular, band of\r\ndim light, which even a powerful telescope in some places can hardly\r\nresolve into stars. How are we to account for this remarkable\r\narrangement of the stars? What is the reason of our seeing so few at the\r\nparts of the heavens farthest from the Milky Way, and so very many in or\r\nnear that wonderful belt? The first attempt to give an answer to these\r\nquestions was made by Thomas Wright, an instrument maker in London, in a\r\nbook published in 1750. He supposed the stars of our sidereal system to\r\nbe distributed in a vast stratum of inconsiderable thickness compared\r\nwith its length and breadth. If we had a big grindstone made of glass,\r\nin which had become uniformly imbedded a vast quantity of grains of sand\r\nor similar minute particles, and if we were able to place our eye\r\nsomewhere near the centre of this grindstone, it is easy to see that we\r\nshould see very few particles near the direction of the axle of the\r\ngrindstone, but a great many if we looked towards any point of the\r\ncircumference. This was Wright's idea of the structure of the Milky Way,\r\nand he supposed the sun to be situated not very far from the centre of\r\nthis stellar stratum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE F.\r\n\r\nô CENTAURI.\r\n\r\n_From a Drawing in the Publications of Harvard College Observatory._]\r\n\r\nIf the Milky Way itself did not exist--and we had simply the fact to\r\nbuild on that the stars appeared to increase rapidly in number towards a\r\ncertain circle (almost a great circle) spanning the heavens--then the\r\ndisc theory might have a good deal in its favour. But the telescopic\r\nstudy of the Milky Way, and even more the marvellous photographs of its\r\ncomplicated structure produced by Professor Barnard, have given the\r\ndeath blow to the old theory, and have made it most reasonable to\r\nconclude that the Milky Way is really, and not only apparently, a mighty\r\nstream of stars encircling the heavens. We shall shortly mention a few\r\nfacts which point in this direction. A mere glance is sufficient to show\r\nthat the Milky Way is not a single belt of light; near the constellation\r\nAquila it separates into two branches with a fairly broad interval\r\nbetween them, and these branches do not meet again until they have\r\nproceeded far into the southern hemisphere. The disc theory had, in\r\norder to explain this, to assume that the stellar stratum was cleft in\r\ntwo nearly to the centre. But even if we grant this, how can we account\r\nfor the numerous more or less dark holes in the Milky Way, the largest\r\nand most remarkable of which is the so-called \"coal sack\" in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere? Obviously we should have to assume the existence of\r\na number of tunnels, drilled through the disc-like stratum, and by some\r\nstrange sympathy all directed towards the spot where our solar system is\r\nsituated. And the many small arms which stretch out from the Milky Way\r\nwould have to be either planes seen edgeways or the convexities of\r\ncurved surfaces viewed tangentially. The improbability of these various\r\nassumptions is very great. But evidence is not wanting that the\r\nrelatively bright stars are crowded together along the same zone where\r\nthe excessively faint ones are so closely packed. The late Mr. Proctor\r\nplotted all the stars which occur in Argelander's great atlas of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, 324,198 in number, on a single chart, and though\r\nthese stars are all above the tenth magnitude, and thus superior in\r\nbrightness to that innumerable host of stars of which the individual\r\nmembers are more or less lost in the galactic zone, and on the\r\nhypothesis of uniform distribution ought to be relatively near to us,\r\nthe chart shows distinctly the whole course of the Milky Way by the\r\nclustering of these stars. This disposes sufficiently of the idea that\r\nthe Milky Way is nothing but a disc-like stratum seen projected on the\r\nheavenly sphere; after this it is hardly necessary to examine Professor\r\nBarnard's photographs and see how fairly bright and very faint regions\r\nalternate without any attempt at regularity, in order to become\r\nconvinced that the Milky Way is more probably a stream of stars\r\nclustered together, a stream or ring of incredibly enormous dimensions,\r\ninside which our solar system happens to be situated. But it must be\r\nadmitted that it is premature to attempt to find the actual figure of\r\nthis stream or to determine the relative distance of the various\r\nportions of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nNEBULÆ\r\n\r\nOBSERVED WITH LORD ROSSE'S GREAT TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICAL NATURE OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Star Spectroscopes--Classification of Stellar Spectra--Type I.,\r\n     with very Few Absorption Lines--Type II., like the Sun--Type III.,\r\n     with Strongly Marked Dark Bands--Distribution of these Classes over\r\n     the Heavens--Motion in the Line of Sight--Orbital Motion Discovered\r\n     with the Spectroscope: New Class of Binaries--Spectra of Temporary\r\n     Stars--Nature of these Bodies.\r\n\r\nWe have frequently in the previous chapters had occasion to refer to the\r\nrevelations of the spectroscope, which form an important chapter in the\r\nhistory of modern science. By its aid a mighty stride has been taken in\r\nour attempt to comprehend the physical constitution of the sun. In the\r\npresent chapter we propose to give an account of what the spectroscope\r\ntells us about the physical constitution of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nQuite a new phase of astronomy is here opened up. Every improvement in\r\ntelescopes revealed fainter and fainter objects, but all the telescopes\r\nin the world could not answer the question as to whether iron and other\r\nelements are to be found in the stars. The ordinary star is a mighty\r\nglowing globe, hotter than a Bessemer converter or a Siemens furnace; if\r\niron is in the star, it must be not only white-hot and molten, but\r\nactually converted into vapour. But the vapour of iron is not visible in\r\nthe telescope. How would you recognise it? How would you know if it\r\ncommingled with the vapour of many other metals or other substances? It\r\nis, in truth, a delicate piece of analysis to discriminate iron in the\r\nglowing atmosphere of a star. But the spectroscope is adequate to the\r\ntask, and it renders its analysis with an amount of evidence that is\r\nabsolutely convincing.\r\n\r\nThat the spectra of the moon and planets are practically nothing but\r\nfaint reproductions of the spectrum of the sun was discovered by the\r\ngreat German optician Fraunhofer about the year 1816. By placing a prism\r\nin front of the object glass of a small theodolite (an instrument used\r\nfor geodetic measurements) he was able to ascertain that Venus and Mars\r\nshowed the same spectrum as the sun, while Sirius gave a very different\r\none. This important observation encouraged him to procure better\r\ninstrumental means with which to continue the work, and he succeeded in\r\ndistinguishing the chief characteristics of the various types of stellar\r\nspectra. The form of instrument which Fraunhofer adopted for this work,\r\nin which the prism was placed outside the object glass of the telescope,\r\nhas not been much used until within the last few years, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining prisms of large dimensions (for it is obvious\r\nthat the prism ought to be as large as the object glass if the full\r\npower of the latter is to be made use of), but this is the simplest form\r\nof spectroscope for observing spectra of objects of no sensible angular\r\ndiameter, like the fixed stars. The parallel rays from the stars are\r\ndispersed by the prism into a spectrum, and this is viewed by means of\r\nthe telescope. But as the image of the star in the telescope is nothing\r\nbut a luminous point, its spectrum will be merely a line in which it\r\nwould not be possible to distinguish any lines crossing it laterally\r\nsuch as those we see in the spectrum of the sun. A cylindrical lens is,\r\ntherefore, placed before the eye-piece of the telescope, and as this has\r\nthe effect of turning a point into a line and a line into a band, the\r\nnarrow spectrum of the star is thereby broadened out into a luminous\r\nband in which we can distinguish any details that exist. In other forms\r\nof stellar spectroscope we require a slit which must be placed in the\r\nfocus of the object glass, and the general arrangement is similar to\r\nthat which we have described in the chapter on the sun, except that a\r\ncylindrical lens is required.\r\n\r\nThe study of the spectra of the fixed stars made hardly any progress\r\nuntil the principles of spectrum analysis had been established by\r\nKirchhoff in 1859. When the dark lines in the solar spectrum had been\r\nproperly interpreted, it was at once evident that science had opened\r\nwide the gates of a new territory for human exploration, of the very\r\nexistence of which hardly anyone had been aware up to that time. We have\r\nseen to what splendid triumphs the study of the sun has led the\r\ninvestigators in this field, and we have seen how very valuable results\r\nhave been obtained by the new method when applied to observations of\r\ncomets and nebulæ. We shall now give some account of what has been\r\nlearned with regard to the constitution of the fixed stars by the\r\nresearches which were inaugurated by Sir William Huggins and continued\r\nand developed by him, as well as by Secchi, Vogel, Pickering, Lockyer,\r\nDunér, Scheiner and others. Here, as in the other modern branches of\r\nastronomy, photography has played a most important part, not only\r\nbecause photographed spectra of stars extend much farther at the violet\r\nend than the observer can follow them with his eye, but also because the\r\npositions of the lines can be very accurately measured on the\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nThe first observer who reduced the apparently chaotic diversity of\r\nstellar spectra to order was Secchi, who showed that they might all be\r\ngrouped according to four types. Within the last thirty years, however,\r\nso many modifications of the various types have been found that it has\r\nbecome necessary to subdivide Secchi's types, and most observers now\r\nmake use of Vogel's classification, which we shall also for convenience\r\nadopt in this chapter.\r\n\r\n_Type I._--In the spectra of stars of this class the metallic lines,\r\nwhich are so very numerous and conspicuous in the sun's violet spectrum,\r\nare very faint and thin, or quite invisible, and the blue and white\r\nparts are very intensely bright. Vogel subdivides the class into three\r\ngroups. In the first (I.a) the hydrogen lines are present, and are\r\nremarkably broad and intense; Sirius, Vega, and Regulus are examples of\r\nthis group. The great breadth of the lines probably indicates that these\r\nstars are surrounded by hydrogen atmospheres of great dimensions. It is\r\ngenerally acknowledged that stars of this group must be the hottest of\r\nall, and support is lent to this view by the appearance in their\r\nspectra of a certain magnesium line, which, as Sir Norman Lockyer showed\r\nmany years ago, by laboratory experiments, does not appear in the\r\nordinary spectrum of magnesium, but is indicative of the presence of the\r\nsubstance at a very high temperature. In the spectra of stars of Group\r\nI.b the hydrogen lines and the few metallic lines are of equal breadth,\r\nand the magnesium line just mentioned is the strongest of all. Rigel and\r\nseveral other bright stars in Orion belong to this group, and it is\r\nremarkable that helium is present at least in some of these stars, so\r\nthat (as Professor Keeler remarks) the spectrum of Rigel may almost be\r\nregarded as the nebular spectrum reversed (lines dark instead of\r\nbright), except that the two chief nebular lines are not reversed in the\r\nstar. This fact will doubtless eventually be of great importance to our\r\nunderstanding the successive development of a star from a nebula; and a\r\nstar like Rigel is no doubt also of very high temperature. This is\r\nprobably not the case with stars of the third subdivision of Type I.\r\n(I.c), the spectra of which are distinguished by the presence of bright\r\nhydrogen lines and the bright helium line D3. Among the stars having\r\nthis very remarkable kind of spectrum is a very interesting variable\r\nstar in the constellation Lyra (b) and the star known as g\r\nCassiopeiæ, both of which have been assiduously observed, their spectra\r\npossessing numerous peculiarities which render an explanation of the\r\nphysical constitution of the stars of this subdivision a very difficult\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nPassing to _Type II._, we find spectra in which the metallic lines are\r\nstrong. The more refrangible end of the spectrum is fainter than in the\r\nprevious Class, and absorption bands are sometimes found towards the red\r\nend. In its first subdivision (II.a) are contained spectra with a large\r\nnumber of strong and well-defined lines due to metals, the hydrogen\r\nlines being also well seen, though they are not specially conspicuous.\r\nAmong the very numerous stars of this group are Capella, Aldebaran,\r\nArcturus, Pollux, etc. The spectra of these stars are in fact\r\npractically identical with the spectrum of our own sun, as shown, for\r\ninstance, by Dr. Scheiner, of the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory, who\r\nhas measured several hundred lines on photographs of the spectrum of\r\nCapella, and found a very close agreement between these lines and\r\ncorresponding ones in the solar spectrum. We can hardly doubt that the\r\nphysical constitution of these stars is very similar to that of our sun.\r\nThis cannot be the case with the stars of the second subdivision (II.b),\r\nthe spectra of which are very complex, each consisting of a continuous\r\nspectrum crossed by numerous dark lines, on which is superposed a second\r\nspectrum of bright lines. Upwards of seventy stars are known to possess\r\nthis extraordinary spectrum, the only bright one among them being a star\r\nof the third magnitude in the southern constellation Argus. Here again\r\nwe have hydrogen and helium represented by bright lines, while the\r\norigin of the remaining bright lines is doubtful. With regard to the\r\nphysical constitution of the stars of this group it is very difficult to\r\ncome to a definite conclusion, but it would seem not unlikely that we\r\nhave here to do with stars which are not only surrounded by an\r\natmosphere of lower temperature, causing the dark lines, but which,\r\noutside of that, have an enormous envelope of hydrogen and other gases.\r\nIn one star at least of this group Professor Campbell, of the Lick\r\nObservatory, has seen the F line as a long line extending a very\r\nappreciable distance on each side of the continuous spectrum, and with\r\nan open slit it was seen as a large circular disc about six seconds in\r\ndiameter; two other principal hydrogen lines showed the same appearance.\r\nAs far as this observation goes, the existence of an extensive gaseous\r\nenvelope surrounding the star seems to be indicated.\r\n\r\n_Type III._ contains comparatively few stars, and the spectra are\r\ncharacterised by numerous dark bands in addition to dark lines, while\r\nthe more refrangible parts are very faint, for which reason the stars\r\nare more or less red in colour. This class has two strongly marked\r\nsubdivisions. In the first (III.a) the principal absorption lines\r\ncoincide with similar ones in the solar spectrum, but with great\r\ndifferences as to intensity, many lines being much stronger in these\r\nstars than in the sun, while many new lines also appear. These\r\ndissimilarities are, however, of less importance than the peculiar\r\nabsorption bands in the red, yellow, and green parts of the spectrum,\r\noverlying the metallic lines, and being sharply defined on the side\r\ntowards the violet and shading off gradually towards the red end of the\r\nspectrum. Bands of this kind belong to chemical combinations, and this\r\nappears to show that somewhere in the atmospheres of these distant suns\r\nthe temperature is low enough to allow stable chemical combinations to\r\nbe formed. The most important star of this kind is Betelgeuze or a\r\nOrionis, the red star of the first magnitude in the shoulder of Orion;\r\nbut it is of special importance to note that many variable stars of long\r\nperiod have spectra of Type III.a. Sir Norman Lockyer predicted in 1887\r\nthat bright lines, probably of hydrogen, would eventually be found to\r\nappear at the maximum of brightness, when the smaller swarm is supposed\r\nto pass through the larger one, and this was soon afterwards confirmed\r\nby the announcement that Professor Pickering had found a number of\r\nhydrogen lines bright on photographs, obtained at Harvard College\r\nObservatory, of the spectrum of the remarkable variable, Mira Ceti, at\r\nthe time of maximum. Professor Pickering has since then reported that\r\nbright lines have been found on the plates of forty-one previously known\r\nvariables of this class, and that more than twenty other stars have been\r\ndetected as variables by this peculiarity of their spectrum; that is,\r\nbright lines being seen in them suggested that the stars were variable,\r\nand further photometric investigations corroborated the fact.\r\n\r\nThe second subdivision (III.b) contains only comparatively faint stars,\r\nof which none exceed the fifth magnitude, and is limited to a small\r\nnumber of red stars. The strongly marked bands in their spectra are\r\nsharply defined and dark on the red side, while they fade away gradually\r\ntowards the violet, exactly the reverse of what we see in the spectra of\r\nIII.a. These bands appear to arise from the absorption due to\r\nhydrocarbon vapours present in the atmospheres of these stars; but there\r\nare also some lines visible which indicate the presence of metallic\r\nvapours, sodium being certainly among these. There can be little doubt\r\nthat these stars represent the last stage in the life of a sun, when it\r\nhas cooled down considerably and is not very far from actual extinction,\r\nowing to the increasing absorption of its remaining light in the\r\natmosphere surrounding it.\r\n\r\nThe method employed for the spectroscopic determination of the motion of\r\na star in the line of sight is the same as the method we have described\r\nin the chapter on the sun. The position of a certain line in the\r\nspectrum of a star is compared with the position of the corresponding\r\nbright line of an element in an artificially produced spectrum, and in\r\nthis manner a displacement of the stellar line either towards the violet\r\n(indicating that the star is approaching us) or towards the red\r\n(indicating that it is receding) may be detected. The earliest attempt\r\nof this sort was made in 1867 by Sir William Huggins, who compared the F\r\nline in the spectrum of Sirius with the same line of the spectrum of\r\nhydrogen contained in a vacuum tube reflected into the field of his\r\nastronomical spectroscope, so that the two spectra appeared side by\r\nside. The work thus commenced and continued by him was afterwards taken\r\nup at the Greenwich Observatory; but the results obtained by these\r\ndirect observations were never satisfactory, as remarkable discrepancies\r\nappeared between the values obtained by different observers, and even by\r\nthe same observer on different nights. This is not to be wondered at\r\nwhen we bear in mind that the velocity of light is so enormous compared\r\nwith any velocity with which a heavenly body may travel, that the change\r\nof wave length resulting from the latter motion can only be a very\r\nminute one, difficult to perceive, and still more difficult to measure.\r\nBut since photography was first made use of for these investigations by\r\nDr. Vogel, of Potsdam, much more accordant and reliable results have\r\nbeen obtained, though even now extreme care is required to avoid\r\nsystematic errors. To give some idea of the results obtainable, we\r\npresent in the following table the values of the velocity per second of\r\na number of stars observed in 1896 and 1897 by Mr. H.F. Newall with the\r\nBruce spectrograph attached to the great 25-inch Newall refractor of the\r\nCambridge Observatory, and we have added the values found at Potsdam by\r\nVogel and Scheiner. The results are expressed in kilometres (1 km. =\r\n0·62 English mile). The sign + means that the star is receding from\r\nus,-that it is approaching.\r\n\r\n                   Newall.   Vogel.   Scheiner.\r\n  Aldebaran        + 49·2    + 47·6    + 49·4\r\n  Betelgeuze       + 10·6    + 15·6    + 18·8\r\n  Procyon          -  4·2    -  7·2    - 10·5\r\n  Pollux           -  0·7    +  1·9    +  0·4\r\n  g Leonis          - 39·9    - 36·5    - 40·5\r\n  Arcturus         -  6·4    -  7·0    -  8·3\r\n\r\nThese results have been corrected for the earth's orbital motion round\r\nthe sun, but not for the sun's motion through space, as the amount of\r\nthe latter is practically unknown, or at least very uncertain; so that\r\nthe above figures really represent the velocity per second of the\r\nvarious stars relative to the sun. We may add that the direction and\r\nvelocity of the sun's motion may eventually be ascertained from\r\nspectroscopic measures of a great number of stars, and it seems likely\r\nthat the sun's velocity will be much more accurately found in this way\r\nthan by the older method of combining proper motions of stars with\r\nspeculations as to the average distances of the various classes of\r\nstars. This has already been attempted by Dr. Kempf, who from the\r\nPotsdam spectrographic observations found the sun's velocity to be 18·6\r\nkilometres, or 11·5 miles per second, a result which is probably not far\r\nfrom the truth.\r\n\r\nBut the spectra of the fixed stars can also tell us something about\r\norbital motion in these extremely distant systems. If one star revolved\r\nround another in a plane passing through the sun, it must on one side of\r\nthe orbit move straight towards us and on the other side move straight\r\naway from us, while it will not alter its distance from us while it is\r\npassing in front of, or behind, the central body. If we therefore find\r\nfrom the spectroscopic observations that a star is alternately moving\r\ntowards and away from the earth in a certain period, there can be no\r\ndoubt that this star is travelling round some unseen body (or, rather,\r\nround the centre of gravity of both) in the period indicated by the\r\nshifting of the spectral lines. In Chapter XIX. we mentioned the\r\nvariable star Algol in the constellation Perseus, which is one of a\r\nclass of variable stars distinguished by the fact that for the greater\r\npart of the period they remain of unaltered brightness, while for a very\r\nshort time they become considerably fainter. That this was caused by\r\nsome sort of an eclipse--or, in other words, by the periodic passage of\r\na dark body in front of the star, hiding more or less of the latter from\r\nus--was the simplest possible hypothesis, and it had already years ago\r\nbeen generally accepted. But it was not possible to prove that this was\r\nthe true explanation of the periodicity of stars like Algol until\r\nProfessor Vogel, from the spectroscopic observations made at Potsdam,\r\nfound that before every minimum Algol is receding from the sun, while it\r\nis approaching us after the minimum. Assuming the orbit to be circular,\r\nthe velocity of Algol was found to be twenty-six miles per second. From\r\nthis and the length of the period (2d. 22h. 48m. 55s.) and the time of\r\nobscuration it was easy to compute the size of the orbit and the actual\r\ndimensions of the two bodies. It was even possible to go a step further\r\nand to calculate from the orbital velocities the masses of the two\r\nbodies,[41] assuming them to be of equal density--an assumption which is\r\nno doubt very uncertain. The following are the approximate elements of\r\nthe Algol system found by Vogel:--\r\n\r\n  Diameter of Algol                      1,054,000 miles.\r\n  Diameter of companion                    825,000 miles.\r\n  Distance between their centres         3,220,000 miles.\r\n  Orbital velocity of Algol             26 miles per sec.\r\n  Orbital velocity of companion         55 miles per sec.\r\n  Mass of Algol                        4/9 of sun's mass.\r\n  Mass of companion                    2/9 of sun's mass.\r\n\r\nThe period of Algol has been gradually decreasing during the last\r\ncentury (by six or seven seconds), but whether this is caused by the\r\nmotion of the pair round a third and very much more distant body, as\r\nsuggested by Mr. Chandler, has still to be found out.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned that in order to produce eclipses, and thereby\r\nvariations of light, it is necessary that the line of sight should lie\r\nnearly in the plane of the orbit. It is also essential that there should\r\nbe a considerable difference of brightness between the two bodies. These\r\nconditions must be fulfilled in the fifteen variable stars of the Algol\r\nclass now known; but according to the theory of probability, there must\r\nbe many more binary systems like that of Algol where these conditions\r\nare not fulfilled, and in those cases no variations will occur in the\r\nstars' brightness. Of course, we know many cases of a luminous star\r\ntravelling round another, but there must also be cases of a large\r\ncompanion travelling round another at so small a distance that our\r\ntelescopes are unable to \"divide\" the double star. This has actually\r\nbeen discovered by means of the spectroscope. If we suppose an extremely\r\nclose double star to be examined with the spectroscope, the spectra of\r\nthe two components will be superposed, and we shall not be aware that we\r\nreally see two different spectra. But during the revolution of the two\r\nbodies round their common centre of gravity there must periodically come\r\na time when one body is moving towards us and the other moving from us,\r\nand consequently the lines in the spectrum of the former will be subject\r\nto a minute, relative shift towards the violet end of the spectrum, and\r\nthose of the other to a minute shift towards the red. Those lines which\r\nare common to the two spectra will therefore periodically become double.\r\nA discovery of this sort was first made in 1889 by Professor Pickering\r\nfrom photographs of the spectrum of Mizar, or z Ursa Majoris, the\r\nlarger component of the well-known double star in the tail of the Great\r\nBear. Certain of the lines were found to be double at intervals of\r\nfifty-two days. The maximum separation of the two components of each\r\nline corresponds to a relative velocity of one star as compared with the\r\nother of about a hundred miles per second, but subsequent observations\r\nhave shown the case to be very complicated, either with a very eccentric\r\nelliptic orbit or possibly owing to the presence of a third body. The\r\nHarvard College photographs also showed periodic duplicity of lines in\r\nthe star b Aurigæ, the period being remarkably short, only three\r\ndays and twenty-three hours and thirty-seven minutes. In 1891 Vogel\r\nfound, from photographs of the spectrum of Spica, the first magnitude\r\nstar in Virgo, that this star alternately recedes from and approaches to\r\nthe solar system, the period being four days. Certain other\r\n\"spectroscopic binaries\" have since then been found, notably one\r\ncomponent of Castor, with a period of three days, found by M.\r\nBelopolsky, and a star in the constellation Scorpio, with a period of\r\nonly thirty-four hours, detected on the Harvard spectrograms.\r\n\r\nQuite recently Mr. H.F. Newall, at Cambridge, and Mr. Campbell, of the\r\nLick Observatory, have shown that a Aurigæ, or Capella, consists\r\nof a sun-like star and a Procyon-like star, revolving in 104 days.\r\n\r\nAt first sight there is something very startling in the idea of two suns\r\ncircling round each other, separated by an interval which, in comparison\r\nwith their diameters, is only a very small one. In the Algol system, for\r\ninstance, we have two bodies, one the size of our own sun and the other\r\nslightly larger, moving round their common centre of gravity in less\r\nthan three days, and at a distance between their surfaces equal to only\r\ntwice the diameter of the larger one. Again, in the system of Spica we\r\nhave two great suns swinging round each other in only four days, at a\r\ndistance equal to that between Saturn and his sixth satellite. But\r\nalthough we have at present nothing analogous to this in our solar\r\nsystem, it can be proved mathematically that it is perfectly possible\r\nfor a system of this kind to preserve its stability, if not for ever, at\r\nany rate for ages, and we shall see in our last chapter that there was\r\nin all probability a time when the earth and the moon formed a peculiar\r\nsystem of two bodies revolving rapidly at a very small distance compared\r\nto the diameters of the bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that we have a more complicated system in the star known\r\nas b Lyræ. This is a variable star of great interest, having a\r\nperiod of twelve days and twenty-two hours, in which time it rises from\r\nmagnitude 4-1/2 to a little above 3-1/2, sinks nearly to the fourth\r\nmagnitude, rises again to fully 3-1/2, and finally falls to magnitude\r\n4-1/2. In 1891 Professor Pickering discovered that the bright lines in\r\nthe spectrum of this star changed their position from time to time,\r\nappearing now on one side, now on the other side of corresponding dark\r\nlines. Obviously these bright lines change their wave length, the\r\nlight-giving source alternately receding from and approaching to the\r\nearth, and the former appeared to be the case during one-half of the\r\nperiod of variation of the star's light, the latter during the other\r\nhalf. The spectrum of this star has been further examined by Belopolsky\r\nand others, who have found that the lines are apparently double, but\r\nthat one of the components either disappears or becomes very narrow from\r\ntime to time. On the assumption that these lines were really single (the\r\napparent duplicity resulting from the superposition of a dark line),\r\nBelopolsky determined the amount of their displacement by measuring the\r\ndistances from the two edges of a line of hydrogen (F) to the artificial\r\nhydrogen line produced by gas glowing in a tube and photographed along\r\nwith the star-spectrum. Assuming the alternate approach and recession to\r\nbe caused by orbital revolution, Belopolsky found that the body emitting\r\nthe light of the bright lines moved with an orbital velocity of\r\nforty-one miles. He succeeded in 1897 in observing the displacement of a\r\ndark line due to magnesium, and found that the body emitting it was also\r\nmoving in an orbit, but while the velocities given by the bright F line\r\nare positive after the principal minimum of the star's light, those\r\ngiven by the dark line are negative. Therefore, during the principal\r\nminimum it is a star giving the dark line which is eclipsed, and during\r\nthe secondary minimum another star giving the bright line is eclipsed.\r\nThis wonderful variable will, however, require more observatioêns before\r\nthe problem of its constitution is finally solved, and the same may be\r\nsaid of several variable stars, _e.g._ ê Aquilæ and d Cephei,\r\nin which a want of harmony has been found between the changes of\r\nvelocity and the fluctuations of the light.\r\n\r\nThere are some striking analogies between the complicated spectrum of\r\nb Lyræ and the spectra of temporary stars. The first \"new star\"\r\nwhich could be spectroscopically examined was that which appeared in\r\nCorona Borealis in 1866, and which was studied by Sir W. Huggins. It\r\nshowed a continuous spectrum with dark absorption lines, and also the\r\nbright lines of hydrogen; practically the same spectrum as the stars of\r\nType II.b. This was also the case with Schmidt's star of 1876, which\r\nshowed the helium line (D3) and the principal nebula line in addition\r\nto the lines of hydrogen; but in the autumn of 1877, when the star had\r\nfallen to the tenth magnitude, Dr. Copeland was surprised to find that\r\nonly one line was visible, the principal nebula line, in which almost\r\nthe whole light of the star was concentrated, the continuous spectrum\r\nbeing hardly traceable. It seemed, in fact, that the star had been\r\ntransformed into a planetary nebula, but later the spectrum seems to\r\nhave lost this peculiar monochromatic character, the nebula line having\r\ndisappeared and a faint continuous spectrum alone being visible, which\r\nis also the case with the star of 1866 since it sank down to the tenth\r\nmagnitude. A continuous spectrum was all that could be seen of the new\r\nstar which broke out in the nebula of Andromeda in 1885, much the same\r\nas the spectrum of the nebula itself.\r\n\r\nWhen the new star in Auriga was announced, in February, 1892,\r\nastronomers were better prepared to observe it spectroscopically, as it\r\nwas now possible by means of photography to study the ultra-violet part\r\nof the spectrum which to the eye is invisible. The visible spectrum was\r\nvery like that of Nova Cygni of 1876, but when the wave-lengths of all\r\nthe bright lines seen and photographed at the Lick Observatory and at\r\nPotsdam were measured, a strong resemblance to the bright line spectrum\r\nof the chromosphere of the sun became very evident. The hydrogen lines\r\nwere very conspicuous, while the iron lines were very numerous, and\r\ncalcium and magnesium were also represented. The most remarkable\r\nrevelation made by the photographs was, however, that the bright lines\r\nwere in many cases accompanied, on the side next the violet, by broad\r\ndark bands, while both bright and dark lines were of a composite\r\ncharacter. Many of the dark lines had a thin bright line superposed in\r\nthe middle, while on the other hand many of the bright lines had two or\r\nthree points maxima of brightness. The results of the measures of motion\r\nin the line of sight were of special importance. They showed that the\r\nsource of light, whence came the thin bright lines within the dark ones,\r\nwas travelling towards the sun at the enormous rate of 400 miles per\r\nsecond, and if the bright lines were actual \"reversals\" of the dark\r\nones, then the source of the absorption spectrum must have been endowed\r\nwith much the same velocity. On the other hand, if the two or three\r\nmaxima of brightness in the bright lines really represent two or three\r\nseparate bodies giving bright lines, the measures indicate that the\r\nprincipal one was almost at rest as regards the sun, while the others\r\nwere receding from us at the extraordinary rates of 300 and 600 miles\r\nper second. And as if this were not sufficiently puzzling, the star on\r\nits revival in August, 1892, as a tenth magnitude star had a totally\r\ndifferent spectrum, showing nothing but a number of the bright lines\r\nbelonging to planetary nebulæ! It is possible that the principal ones of\r\nthese were really present in the spectrum from the first, but that their\r\nwave lengths had been different owing to change of the motion in the\r\nline of sight, so that the nebula lines seen in the autumn were\r\nidentical with others seen in the spring at slightly different places.\r\nSubsequent observations of these nebula lines seemed to point to a\r\nmotion of the Nova towards the solar system (of about 150 miles per\r\nsecond) which gradually diminished.\r\n\r\nBut although we are obliged to confess our inability to say for certain\r\nwhy a temporary star blazes up so suddenly, we have every cause to think\r\nthat these strange bodies will by degrees tell us a great deal about the\r\nconstitution of the fixed stars. The great variety of spectra which we\r\nsee in the starry universe, nebula spectra with bright lines, stellar\r\nspectra of the same general character, others with broad absorption\r\nbands, or numerous dark lines like our sun, or a few absorption lines\r\nonly--all this shows us the universe as teeming with bodies in various\r\nstages of evolution. We shall have a few more words to say on this\r\nmatter when we come to consider the astronomical significance of heat;\r\nbut we have reached a point where man's intellect can hardly keep pace\r\nwith the development of our instrumental resources, and where our\r\nimagination stands bewildered when we endeavour to systematise the\r\nknowledge we have gained. That great caution will have to be exercised\r\nin the interpretation of the observed phenomena is evident from the\r\nrecent experience of Professor Rowland, of Baltimore, from which we\r\nlearn that spectral lines are not only widened by increased pressure of\r\nthe light-giving vapour, but that they may be bodily shifted thereby.\r\nDr. Zeeman's discovery, that a line from a source placed in a strong\r\nmagnetic field may be both widened, broadened, and doubled, will also\r\nincrease our difficulties in the interpretation of these obscure\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRECESSION AND NUTATION OF THE EARTH'S AXIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Pole is not a Fixed Point--Its Effect on the Apparent Places of\r\n     the Stars--The Illustration of the Peg-Top--The Disturbing Force\r\n     which acts on the Earth--Attraction of the Sun on a Globe--The\r\n     Protuberance at the Equator--The Attraction of the Protuberance by\r\n     the Sun and by the Moon produces Precession--The Efficiency of the\r\n     Precessional Agent varies inversely as the Cube of the\r\n     Distance--The Relative Efficiency of the Sun and the Moon--How the\r\n     Pole of the Earth's Axis revolves round the Pole of the\r\n     Ecliptic--Variation of Latitude.\r\n\r\nThe position of the pole of the heavens is most conveniently indicated\r\nby the bright star known as the Pole Star, which lies in its immediate\r\nvicinity. Around this pole the whole heavens appear to rotate once in a\r\nsidereal day; and we have hitherto always referred to the pole as though\r\nit were a fixed point in the heavens. This language is sufficiently\r\ncorrect when we embrace only a moderate period of time in our review. It\r\nis no doubt true that the pole lies near the Pole Star at the present\r\ntime. It did so during the lives of the last generation, and it will do\r\nso during the lives of the next generation. All this time, however, the\r\npole is steadily moving in the heavens, so that the time will at length\r\ncome when the pole will have departed a long way from the present Pole\r\nStar. This movement is incessant. It can be easily detected and measured\r\nby the instruments in our observatories, and astronomers are familiar\r\nwith the fact that in all their calculations it is necessary to hold\r\nspecial account of this movement of the pole. It produces an apparent\r\nchange in the position of a star, which is known by the term\r\n\"precession.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.]\r\n\r\nThe movement of the pole is very clearly shown in the accompanying\r\nfigure (Fig. 100), for which I am indebted to the kindness of the late\r\nProfessor C. Piazzi Smyth. The circle shows the track along which the\r\npole moves among the stars.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the circle in the constellation of Draco is the pole of\r\nthe ecliptic. A complete journey of the pole occupies the considerable\r\nperiod of about 25,867 years. The drawing shows the position of the\r\npole at the several dates from 4000 B.C. to 2000 A.D. A glance at this\r\nmap brings prominently before us how casual is the proximity of the pole\r\nto the Pole Star. At present, indeed, the distance of the two is\r\nactually lessening, but afterwards the distance will increase until,\r\nwhen half of the revolution has been accomplished, the pole will be at a\r\ndistance of twice the radius of the circle from the Pole Star. It will\r\nthen happen that the pole will be near the bright star Vega or a\r\nLyræ, so that our successors some 12,000 years hence may make use of\r\nVega for many of the purposes for which the Pole Star is at present\r\nemployed! Looking back into past ages, we see that some 2,000 or 3,000\r\nyears B.C. the star a Draconis was suitably placed to serve as the\r\nPole Star, when b and d of the Great Bear served as pointers.\r\nIt need hardly be added, that since the birth of accurate astronomy the\r\ncourse of the pole has only been observed over a very small part of the\r\nmighty circle. We are not, however, entitled to doubt that the motion of\r\nthe pole will continue to pursue the same path. This will be made\r\nabundantly clear when we proceed to render an explanation of this very\r\ninteresting phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe north pole of the heavens is the point of the celestial sphere\r\ntowards which the northern end of the axis about which the earth rotates\r\nis directed. It therefore follows that this axis must be constantly\r\nchanging its position. The character of the movement of the earth, so\r\nfar as its rotation is concerned, may be illustrated by a very common\r\ntoy with which every boy is familiar. When a peg-top is set spinning, it\r\nhas, of course, a very rapid rotation around its axis; but besides this\r\nrotation there is usually another motion, whereby the axis of the\r\npeg-top does not remain in a constant direction, but moves in a conical\r\npath around the vertical line. The adjoining figure (Fig. 101) gives a\r\nview of the peg-top. It is, of course, rotating with great rapidity\r\naround its axis, while the axis itself revolves around the vertical line\r\nwith a very deliberate motion. If we could imagine a vast peg-top which\r\nrotated on its axis once a day, and if that axis were inclined at an\r\nangle of twenty-three and a half degrees to the vertical, and if the\r\nslow conical motion of the axis were such that the revolution of the\r\naxis were completed in about 26,000 years, then the movements would\r\nresemble those actually made by the earth. The illustration of the\r\npeg-top comes, indeed, very close to the actual phenomenon of\r\nprecession. In each case the rotation about the axis is far more rapid\r\nthan that of the revolution of the axis itself; in each case also the\r\nslow movement is due to an external interference. Looking at the figure\r\nof the peg-top (Fig. 101) we may ask the question, Why does it not fall\r\ndown? The obvious effect of gravity would seem to say that it is\r\nimpossible for the peg-top to be in the position shown in the figure.\r\nYet everybody knows that this is possible so long as the top is\r\nspinning. If the top were not spinning, it would, of course, fall. It\r\ntherefore follows that the effect of the rapid rotation of the top so\r\nmodifies the effect of gravitation that the latter, instead of producing\r\nits apparently obvious consequence, causes the slow conical motion of\r\nthe axis of rotation. This is, no doubt, a dynamical question of some\r\ndifficulty, but it is easy to verify experimentally that it is the case.\r\nIf a top be constructed so that the point about which it is spinning\r\nshall coincide with the centre of gravity, then there is no effect of\r\ngravitation on the top, and there is no conical motion perceived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--Illustration of the Motion of Precession.]\r\n\r\nIf the earth were subject to no external interference, then the\r\ndirection of the axis about which it rotates must remain for ever\r\nconstant; but as the direction of the axis does not remain constant, it\r\nis necessary to seek for a disturbing force adequate to the production\r\nof the phenomena which are observed. We have invariably found that the\r\ndynamical phenomena of astronomy can be accounted for by the law of\r\nuniversal gravitation. It is therefore natural to enquire how far\r\ngravitation will render an account of the phenomenon of precession; and\r\nto put the matter in its simplest form, let us consider the effect which\r\na distant attracting body can have upon the rotation of the earth.\r\n\r\nTo answer this question, it becomes necessary to define precisely what\r\nwe mean by the earth; and as for most purposes of astronomy we regard\r\nthe earth as a spherical globe, we shall commence with this assumption.\r\nIt seems also certain that the interior of the earth is, on the whole,\r\nheavier than the outer portions. It is therefore reasonable to assume\r\nthat the density increases as we descend; nor is there any sufficient\r\nground for thinking that the earth is much heavier in one part than at\r\nany other part equally remote from the centre. It is therefore usual in\r\nsuch calculations to assume that the earth is formed of concentric\r\nspherical shells, each one of which is of uniform density; while the\r\ndensity decreases from each shell to the one exterior thereto.\r\n\r\nA globe of this constitution being submitted to the attraction of some\r\nexternal body, let us examine the effects which that external body can\r\nproduce. Suppose, for instance, the sun attracts a globe of this\r\ncharacter, what movements will be the result? The first and most obvious\r\nresult is that which we have already so frequently discussed, and which\r\nis expressed by Kepler's laws: the attraction will compel the earth to\r\nrevolve around the sun in an elliptic path, of which the sun is in the\r\nfocus. With this movement we are, however, not at this moment concerned.\r\nWe must enquire how far the sun's attraction can modify the earth's\r\nrotation around its axis. It can be demonstrated that the attraction of\r\nthe sun would be powerless to derange the rotation of the earth so\r\nconstituted. This is a result which can be formally proved by\r\nmathematical calculation. It is, however, sufficiently obvious that the\r\nforce of attraction of any distant point on a symmetrical globe must\r\npass through the centre of that globe: and as the sun is only an\r\nenormous aggregate of attracting points, it can only produce a\r\ncorresponding multitude of attractive forces; each of these forces\r\npasses through the centre of the earth, and consequently the resultant\r\nforce which expresses the joint result of all the individual forces must\r\nalso be directed through the centre of the earth. A force of this\r\ncharacter, whatever other potent influence it may have, will be\r\npowerless to affect the rotation of the earth. If the earth be rotating\r\non an axis, the direction of that axis would be invariably preserved; so\r\nthat as the earth revolves around the sun, it would still continue to\r\nrotate around an axis which always remained parallel to itself. Nor\r\nwould the attraction of the earth by any other body prove more\r\nefficacious than that of the sun. If the earth really were the\r\nsymmetrical globe we have supposed, then the attraction of the sun and\r\nmoon, and even the influence of all the planets as well, would never be\r\ncompetent to make the earth's axis of rotation swerve for a single\r\nsecond from its original direction.\r\n\r\nWe have thus narrowed very closely the search for the cause of the\r\n\"precession.\" If the earth were a perfect sphere, precession would be\r\ninexplicable. We are therefore forced to seek for an explanation of\r\nprecession in the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere. This we\r\nhave already demonstrated to be the case. We have shown that the\r\nequatorial axis of the earth is longer than the polar axis, so that\r\nthere is a protuberant zone girdling the equator. The attraction of\r\nexternal bodies is able to grasp this protuberance, and thereby force\r\nthe earth's axis of rotation to change its direction.\r\n\r\nThere are only two bodies in the universe which sensibly contribute to\r\nthe precessional movement of the earth's axis: these bodies are the sun\r\nand the moon. The shares in which the labour is borne by the sun and the\r\nmoon are not what might have been expected from a hasty view of the\r\nsubject. This is a point on which it will be desirable to dwell, as it\r\nillustrates a point in the theory of gravitation which is of very\r\nconsiderable importance.\r\n\r\nThe law of gravitation asserts that the intensity of the attraction\r\nwhich a body can exercise is directly proportional to the mass of that\r\nbody, and inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the\r\nattracted point. We can thus compare the attraction exerted upon the\r\nearth by the sun and by the moon. The mass of the sun exceeds the mass\r\nof the moon in the proportion of about 26,000,000 to 1. On the other\r\nhand, the moon is at a distance which, on an average, is about one-386th\r\npart of that of the sun. It is thus an easy calculation to show that the\r\nefficiency of the sun's attraction on the earth is about 175 times as\r\ngreat as the attraction of the moon. Hence it is, of course, that the\r\nearth obeys the supremely important attraction of the sun, and pursues\r\nan elliptic path around the sun, bearing the moon as an appendage.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to that particular effect of attraction which is\r\ncompetent to produce precession, we find that the law by which the\r\nefficiency of the attracting body is computed assumes a different form.\r\nThe measure of efficiency is, in this case, to be found by taking the\r\nmass of the body and dividing it by the _cube_ of the distance. The\r\ncomplete demonstration of this statement must be sought in the formulæ\r\nof mathematics, and cannot be introduced into these pages; we may,\r\nhowever, adduce one consideration which will enable the reader in some\r\ndegree to understand the principle, though without pretending to be a\r\ndemonstration of its accuracy. It will be obvious that the nearer the\r\ndisturbing body approaches to the earth the greater is the _leverage_\r\n(if we may use the expression) which is afforded by the protuberance at\r\nthe equator. The efficiency of a given force will, therefore, on this\r\naccount alone, increase in the inverse proportion of the distance. The\r\nactual intensity of the force itself augments in the inverse square of\r\nthe distance, and hence the capacity of the attracting body for\r\nproducing precession will, for a double reason, increase when the\r\ndistance decreases. Suppose, for example, that the disturbing body is\r\nbrought to half its original distance from the disturbed body, the\r\nleverage is by this means doubled, while the actual intensity of the\r\nforce is at the same time quadrupled according to the law of\r\ngravitation. It will follow that the effect produced in the latter case\r\nmust be eight times as great as in the former case. And this is merely\r\nequivalent to the statement that the precession-producing capacity of a\r\nbody varies inversely as the cube of the distance.\r\n\r\nIt is this consideration which gives to the moon an importance as a\r\nprecession-producing agent to which its mere attractive capacity would\r\nnot have entitled it. Even though the mass of the sun be 26,000,000\r\ntimes as great as the mass of the moon, yet when this number is divided\r\nby the cube of the relative value of the distances of the bodies (386),\r\nit is seen that the efficiency of the moon is more than twice as great\r\nas that of the sun. In other words, we may say that one-third of the\r\nmovement of precession is due to the sun, and two-thirds to the moon.\r\n\r\nFor the study of the joint precessional effect due to the sun and the\r\nmoon acting simultaneously, it will be advantageous to consider the\r\neffect produced by the two bodies separately; and as the case of the sun\r\nis the simpler of the two, we shall take it first. As the earth travels\r\nin its annual path around the sun, the axis of the earth is directed to\r\na point in the heavens which is 23-1/2° from the pole of the ecliptic.\r\nThe precessional effect of the sun is to cause this point--the pole of\r\nthe earth--to revolve, always preserving the same angular distance from\r\nthe pole of the ecliptic; and thus we have a motion of the type\r\nrepresented in the diagram. As the ecliptic occupies a position which\r\nfor our present purpose we may regard as fixed in space, it follows that\r\nthe pole of the ecliptic is a fixed point on the surface of the heavens;\r\nso that the path of the pole of the earth must be a small circle in the\r\nheavens, fixed in its position relatively to the surrounding stars. In\r\nthis we find a motion strictly analogous to that of the peg-top. It is\r\nthe gravitation of the earth acting upon the peg-top which forces it\r\ninto the conical motion. The immediate effect of the gravitation is so\r\nmodified by the rapid rotation of the top, that, in obedience to a\r\nprofound dynamical principle, the axis of the top revolves in a cone\r\nrather than fall down, as it would do were the top not spinning. In a\r\nsimilar manner the immediate effect of the sun's attraction on the\r\nprotuberance at the equator would be to bring the pole of the earth's\r\naxis towards the pole of the ecliptic, but the rapid rotation of the\r\nearth modifies this into the conical movement of precession.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances with regard to the moon are much more complicated.\r\nThe moon describes a certain orbit around the earth; that orbit lies in\r\na certain plane, and that plane has, of course, a certain pole on the\r\ncelestial sphere. The precessional effect of the moon would accordingly\r\ntend to make the pole of the earth's axis describe a circle around that\r\npoint in the heavens which is the pole of the moon's orbit. This point\r\nis about 5° from the pole of the ecliptic. The pole of the earth is\r\ntherefore solicited by two different movements--one a revolution around\r\nthe pole of the ecliptic, the other a revolution about another point 5°\r\ndistant, which is the pole of the moon's orbit. It would thus seem that\r\nthe earth's pole should make a certain composite movement due to the two\r\nseparate movements. This is really the case, but there is a point to be\r\nvery carefully attended to, which at first seems almost paradoxical. We\r\nhave shown how the potency of the moon as a precessional agent exceeds\r\nthat of the sun, and therefore it might be thought that the composite\r\nmovement of the earth's pole would conform more nearly to a rotation\r\naround the pole of the plane of the moon's orbit than to a rotation\r\naround the pole of the ecliptic; but this is not the case. The\r\nprecessional movement is represented by a revolution around the pole of\r\nthe ecliptic, as is shown in the figure. Here lies the germ of one of\r\nthose exquisite astronomical discoveries which delight us by\r\nillustrating some of the most subtle phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nThe plane in which the moon revolves does not occupy a constant\r\nposition. We are not here specially concerned with the causes of this\r\nchange in the plane of the moon's orbit, but the character of the\r\nmovement must be enunciated. The inclination of this plane to the\r\necliptic is about 5°, and this inclination does not vary (except within\r\nvery narrow limits); but the line of intersection of the two planes does\r\nvary, and, in fact, varies so quickly that it completes a revolution in\r\nabout 18-2/3 years. This movement of the plane of the moon's orbit\r\nnecessitates a corresponding change in the position of its pole. We thus\r\nsee that the pole of the moon's orbit must be actually revolving around\r\nthe pole of the ecliptic, always remaining at the same distance of 5°,\r\nand completing its revolution in 18-2/3 years. It will, therefore, be\r\nobvious that there is a profound difference between the precessional\r\neffect of the sun and of the moon in their action on the earth. The sun\r\ninvites the earth's pole to describe a circle around a fixed centre; the\r\nmoon invites the earth's pole to describe a circle around a centre which\r\nis itself in constant motion. It fortunately happens that the\r\ncircumstances of the case are such as to reduce considerably the\r\ncomplexity of the problem. The movement of the moon's plane, only\r\noccupying about 18-2/3 years, is a very rapid motion compared with the\r\nwhole precessional movement, which occupies about 26,000 years. It\r\nfollows that by the time the earth's axis has completed one circuit of\r\nits majestic cone, the pole of the moon's plane will have gone round\r\nabout 1,400 times. Now, as this pole really only describes a\r\ncomparatively small cone of 5° in radius, we may for a first\r\napproximation take the average position which it occupies; but this\r\naverage position is, of course, the centre of the circle which it\r\ndescribes--that is, the pole of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the average precessional effect of the moon simply\r\nconspires with that of the sun to produce a revolution around the pole\r\nof the ecliptic. The grosser phenomena of the movements of the earth's\r\naxis are to be explained by the uniform revolution of the pole in a\r\ncircular path; but if we make a minute examination of the track of the\r\nearth's axis, we shall find that though it, on the whole, conforms with\r\nthe circle, yet that it really traces out a sinuous line, sometimes on\r\nthe inside and sometimes on the outside of the circle. This delicate\r\nmovement arises from the continuous change in the place of the pole of\r\nthe moon's orbit. The period of these undulations is 18-2/3 years,\r\nagreeing exactly with the period of the revolution of the moon's nodes.\r\nThe amount by which the pole departs from the circle on either side is\r\nonly about 9·2 seconds--a quantity rather less than the\r\ntwenty-thousandth part of the radius of the sphere. This phenomenon,\r\nknown as \"nutation,\" was discovered by the beautiful telescopic\r\nresearches of Bradley, in 1747. Whether we look at the theoretical\r\ninterest of the subject or at the refinement of the observations\r\ninvolved, this achievement of the \"Vir incomparabilis,\" as Bradley has\r\nbeen called by Bessel, is one of the masterpieces of astronomical\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of precession and nutation depend on movements of the\r\nearth itself, and not on movements of the axis of rotation within the\r\nearth. Therefore the distance of any particular spot on the earth from\r\nthe north or south pole is not disturbed by either of these phenomena.\r\nThe latitude of a place is the distance of the place from the earth's\r\nequator, and this quantity remains unaltered in the course of the long\r\nprecession cycle of 26,000 years. But it has been discovered within the\r\nlast few years that latitudes are subject to a small periodic change of\r\na few tenths of a second of arc. This was first pointed out about 1880\r\nby Dr. Küstner, of Berlin, and by a masterly analysis of all available\r\nobservations, made in the course of many years past at various\r\nobservatories, Dr. Chandler, of Boston, has shown that the latitude of\r\nevery point on the earth is subject to a double oscillation, the period\r\nof one being 427 days and the other about a year, the mean amplitude of\r\neach being O\"·14. In other words, the spot in the arctic regions,\r\ndirectly in the prolongation of the earth's axis of rotation, is not\r\nabsolutely fixed; the end of the imaginary axis moves about in a\r\ncomplicated manner, but always keeping within a few yards of its average\r\nposition. This remarkable discovery is not only of value as introducing\r\na new refinement in many astronomical researches depending on an\r\naccurate knowledge of the latitude, but theoretical investigations show\r\nthat the periods of this variation are incompatible with the assumption\r\nthat the earth is an absolutely rigid body. Though this assumption has\r\nin other ways been found to be untenable, the confirmation of this view\r\nby the discovery of Dr. Chandler is of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE ABERRATION OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Real and Apparent Movements of the Stars--How they can be\r\n     Discriminated--Aberration produces Effects dependent on the\r\n     Position of the Stars--The Pole of the Ecliptic--Aberration makes\r\n     Stars seem to Move in a Circle, an Ellipse, or a Straight Line\r\n     according to Position--All the Ellipses have Equal Major Axes--How\r\n     is this Movement to be Explained?--How to be Distinguished from\r\n     Annual Parallax--The Apex of the Earth's Way--How this is to be\r\n     Explained by the Velocity of Light--How the Scale of the Solar\r\n     System can be Measured by the Aberration of Light.\r\n\r\nWe have in this chapter to narrate a discovery of a recondite character,\r\nwhich illustrates in a forcible manner some of the fundamental truths of\r\nAstronomy. Our discussion of it will naturally be divided into two\r\nparts. In the first part we must describe the nature of the phenomenon,\r\nand then we must give the extremely elegant explanation afforded by the\r\nproperties of light. The telescopic discovery of aberration, as well as\r\nits explanation, are both due to the illustrious Bradley.\r\n\r\nThe expression _fixed_ star, so often used in astronomy, is to be\r\nreceived in a very qualified sense. The stars are, no doubt, well fixed\r\nin their places, so far as coarse observation is concerned. The\r\nlineaments of the constellations remain unchanged for centuries, and, in\r\ncontrast with the ceaseless movements of the planets, the stars are not\r\ninappropriately called fixed. We have, however, had more than one\r\noccasion to show throughout the course of this work that the expression\r\n\"fixed star\" is not an accurate one when minute quantities are held in\r\nestimation. With the exact measures of modern instruments, many of these\r\nquantities are so perceptible that they have to be always reckoned with\r\nin astronomical enquiry. We can divide the movements of the stars into\r\ntwo great classes: the real movements and the apparent movements. The\r\nproper motion of the stars and the movements of revolution of the binary\r\nstars constitute the real movements of these bodies. These movements are\r\nspecial to each star, so that two stars, although close together in the\r\nheavens, may differ in the widest degree as to the real movements which\r\nthey possess. It may, indeed, sometimes happen that stars in a certain\r\nregion are animated with a common movement. In this phenomenon we have\r\ntraces of a real movement shared by a number of stars in a certain\r\ngroup. With this exception, however, the real movements of the stars\r\nseem to be governed by no systematic law, and the rapidly moving stars\r\nare scattered here and there indiscriminately over the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe apparent movements of the stars have a different character, inasmuch\r\nas we find the movement of each star determined by the place which it\r\noccupies in the heavens. It is by this means that we discriminate the\r\nreal movements of the star from its apparent movements, and examine the\r\ncharacter of both.\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter we are concerned with the apparent movements\r\nonly, and of these there are three, due respectively to precession, to\r\nnutation, and to aberration. Each of these apparent movements obeys laws\r\npeculiar to itself, and thus it becomes possible to analyse the total\r\napparent motion, and to discriminate the proportions in which the\r\nprecession, the nutation, and the aberration have severally contributed.\r\nWe are thus enabled to isolate the effect of aberration as completely as\r\nif it were the sole agent of apparent displacement, so that, by an\r\nalliance between mathematical calculation and astronomical observation,\r\nwe can study the effects of aberration as clearly as if the stars were\r\naffected by no other motions.\r\n\r\nConcentrating our attention solely on the phenomena of aberration we\r\nshall describe its particular effect upon stars in different regions of\r\nthe sky, and thus ascertain the laws according to which the effects of\r\naberration are exhibited. When this step has been taken, we shall be in\r\na position to give the beautiful explanation of those laws dependent\r\nupon the velocity of light.\r\n\r\nAt one particular region of the heavens the effect of aberration has a\r\ndegree of simplicity which is not manifested anywhere else. This region\r\nlies in the constellation Draco, at the pole of the ecliptic. At this\r\npole, or in its immediate neighbourhood, each star, in virtue of\r\naberration, describes a circle in the heavens. This circle is very\r\nminute; it would take something like 2,000 of these circles together to\r\nform an area equal to the area of the moon. Expressed in the usual\r\nastronomical language, we should say that the diameter of this small\r\ncircle is about 40·9 seconds of arc. This is a quantity which, though\r\nsmall to the unaided eye, is really of great relative magnitude in the\r\npresent state of telescopic research. It is not only large enough to be\r\nperceived, but it can be measured, with an accuracy which actually does\r\nnot admit of a doubt, to the hundredth part of the whole. It is also\r\nobserved that each star describes its little circle in precisely the\r\nsame period of time; and that period is one year, or, in other words,\r\nthe time of the revolution of the earth around the sun. It is found that\r\nfor all stars in this region, be they large stars or small, single or\r\ndouble, white or coloured, the circles appropriate to each have all the\r\nsame size, and are all described in the same time. Even from this alone\r\nit would be manifest that the cause of the phenomenon cannot lie in the\r\nstar itself. This unanimity in stars of every magnitude and distance\r\nrequires some simpler explanation.\r\n\r\nFurther examination of stars in different regions sheds new light on the\r\nsubject. As we proceed from the pole of the ecliptic, we still find that\r\neach star exhibits an annual movement of the same character as the stars\r\njust considered. In one respect, however, there is a difference. The\r\napparent path of the star is no longer a circle; it has become an\r\nellipse. It is, however, soon perceived that the shape and the position\r\nof this ellipse are governed by the simple law that the further the star\r\nis from the pole of the ecliptic the greater is the eccentricity of the\r\nellipse. The apparent path of the stars at the same distance from the\r\npole have equal eccentricity, and of the axes of the ellipse the shorter\r\nis always directed to the pole, the longer being, of course,\r\nperpendicular to it. It is, however, found that no matter how great the\r\neccentricity may become, the major axis always retains its original\r\nlength. It is always equal to about 40·9 seconds--that is, to the\r\ndiameter of the circle of aberration at the pole itself. As we proceed\r\nfurther and further from the pole of the ecliptic, we find that each\r\nstar describes a path more and more eccentric, until at length, when we\r\nexamine a star on the ecliptic, the ellipse has become so attenuated\r\nthat it has flattened into a line. Each star which happens to lie on the\r\necliptic oscillates to and fro along the ecliptic through an amplitude\r\nof 40·9 seconds. Half a year accomplishes the journey one way, and the\r\nother half of the year restores the star to its original position. When\r\nwe pass to stars on the southern side of the ecliptic, we see the same\r\nseries of changes proceed in an inverse order. The ellipse, from being\r\nactually linear, gradually grows in width, though still preserving the\r\nsame length of major axis, until at length the stars near the southern\r\npole of the ecliptic are each found to describe a circle equal to the\r\npaths pursued by the stars at the north pole of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that the major axes of all those ellipses are of equal\r\nlength suggests a still further simplification. Let us suppose that\r\nevery star, either at the pole of the ecliptic or elsewhere, pursues an\r\nabsolutely circular path, and that all these circles agree not only in\r\nmagnitude, but also in being all parallel to the plane of the ecliptic:\r\nit is easy to see that this simple supposition will account for the\r\nobserved facts. The stars at the pole of the ecliptic will, of course,\r\nshow their circles turned fairly towards us, and we shall see that they\r\npursue circular paths. The circular paths of the stars remote from the\r\npole of the ecliptic will, however, be only seen somewhat edgewise, and\r\nthus the apparent paths will be elliptical, as we actually find them. We\r\ncan even calculate the degree of ellipticity which this surmise would\r\nrequire, and we find that it coincides with the observed ellipticity.\r\nFinally, when we observe stars actually moving in the ecliptic, the\r\ncircles they follow would be seen edgewise, and thus the stars would\r\nhave merely the linear movement which they are seen to possess. All the\r\nobserved phenomena are thus found to be completely consistent with the\r\nsupposition that every star of all the millions in the heavens describes\r\nonce each year a circular path; and that, whether the star be far or\r\nnear, this circle has always the same apparent diameter, and lies in a\r\nplane always parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nWe have now wrought the facts of observation into a form which enables\r\nus to examine into the cause of a movement so systematic. Why is it that\r\neach star should seem to describe a small circular path? Why should that\r\npath be parallel to the ecliptic? Why should it be completed exactly in\r\na twelvemonth? We are at once referred to the motion of the earth around\r\nthe sun. That movement takes place in the ecliptic. It is completed in a\r\nyear. The coincidences are so obvious that we feel almost necessarily\r\ncompelled to connect in some way this apparent movement of the stars\r\nwith the annual movement of the earth around the sun. If there were no\r\nsuch connection, it would be in the highest degree improbable that the\r\nplanes of the circles should be all parallel to the ecliptic, or that\r\nthe time of revolution of each star in its circle should equal that of\r\nthe revolution of the earth around the sun. As both these conditions are\r\nfulfilled, the probability of the connection rises to a value almost\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\nThe important question has then arisen as to why the movement of the\r\nearth around the sun should be associated in so remarkable a manner with\r\nthis universal star movement. There is here one obvious point to be\r\nnoticed and to be dismissed. We have in a previous chapter discussed the\r\nimportant question of the annual parallax of stars, and we have shown\r\nhow, in virtue of annual parallax, each star describes an ellipse. It\r\ncan further be demonstrated that these ellipses are really circles\r\nparallel to the ecliptic; so that we might hastily assume that annual\r\nparallax was the cause of the phenomenon discovered by Bradley. A single\r\ncircumstance will, however, dispose of this suggestion. The circle\r\ndescribed by a star in virtue of annual parallax has a magnitude\r\ndependent on the distance of the star, so that the circles described by\r\nvarious stars are of various dimensions, corresponding to the varied\r\ndistances of different stars. The phenomena of aberration, however,\r\ndistinctly assert that the circular path of each star is of the same\r\nsize, quite independently of what its distance may be, and hence annual\r\nparallax will not afford an adequate explanation. It should also be\r\nnoticed that the movements of a star produced by annual parallax are\r\nmuch smaller than those due to aberration. There is not any known star\r\nwhose circular path due to annual parallax has a diameter one-twentieth\r\npart of that of the circle due to aberration; indeed, in the great\r\nmajority of cases the parallax of the star is an absolutely insensible\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a still graver and quite insuperable distinction\r\nbetween the parallactic path and the aberrational path. Let us, for\r\nsimplicity, think of a star situated near the pole of the ecliptic, and\r\nthus appearing to revolve annually in a circle, whether we regard either\r\nthe phenomenon of parallax or of aberration. As the earth revolves, so\r\ndoes the star appear to revolve; and thus to each place of the earth in\r\nits orbit corresponds a certain place of the star in its circle. If the\r\nmovement arise from annual parallax, it is easy to see where the place\r\nof the star will be for any position of the earth. It is, however, found\r\nthat in the movement discovered by Bradley the star never has the\r\nposition which parallax assigns to it, but is, in fact, a quarter of the\r\ncircumference of its little circle distant therefrom.\r\n\r\nA simple rule will find the position of the star due to aberration. Draw\r\nfrom the centre of the ellipse a radius parallel to the direction in\r\nwhich the earth is moving at the moment in question, then the extremity\r\nof this radius gives the point on its ellipse where the star is to be\r\nfound. Tested at all seasons, and with all stars, this law is found to\r\nbe always verified, and by its means we are conducted to the true\r\nexplanation of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWe can enunciate the effects of aberration in a somewhat different\r\nmanner, which will show even more forcibly how the phenomenon is\r\nconnected with the motion of the earth in its orbit. As the earth\r\npursues its annual course around the sun, its movement at any moment may\r\nbe regarded as directed towards a certain point of the ecliptic. From\r\nday to day, and even from hour to hour, the point gradually moves along\r\nthe ecliptic, so as to complete the circuit in a year. At each moment,\r\nhowever, there is always a certain point in the heavens towards which\r\nthe earth's motion is directed. It is, in fact, the point on the\r\ncelestial sphere towards which the earth would travel continuously if,\r\nat the moment, the attraction of the sun could be annihilated. It is\r\nfound that this point is intimately connected with the phenomenon of\r\naberration. In fact, the aberration is really equivalent to drawing each\r\nstar from its mean place towards the Apex of the Earth's Way, as the\r\npoint is sometimes termed. It can also be shown by observation that the\r\namount of aberration depends upon the distance from the apex. A star\r\nwhich happened to lie on the ecliptic will not be at all deranged by\r\naberration from its mean place when it happens that the apex coincides\r\nwith the star. All the stars 10° from the apex will be displaced each by\r\nthe same amount, and all directly in towards the apex. A star 20° from\r\nthe apex will undergo a larger degree of displacement, though still in\r\nthe same direction, exactly towards the apex; and all stars at the same\r\ndistance will be displaced by the same amount. Proceeding thus from the\r\napex, we come to stars at a distance of 90° therefrom. Here the amount\r\nof displacement will be a maximum. Each one will be about twenty seconds\r\nfrom its average place; but in every case the imperative law will be\r\nobeyed, that the displacement of the star from its mean place lies\r\ntowards the apex of the earth's way. We have thus given two distinct\r\ndescriptions of the phenomenon of aberration. In the first we find it\r\nconvenient to speak of a star as describing a minute circular path; in\r\nthe other we have regarded aberration as merely amounting to a\r\nderangement of the star from its mean place in accordance with specified\r\nlaws. These descriptions are not inconsistent: they are, in fact,\r\ngeometrically equivalent; but the latter is rather the more perfect,\r\ninasmuch as it assigns completely the direction and extent of the\r\nderangement caused by aberration in any particular star at any\r\nparticular moment.\r\n\r\nThe question has now been narrowed to a very definite form. What is it\r\nwhich makes each star seem to close in towards the point towards which\r\nthe earth is travelling? The answer will be found when we make a minute\r\nenquiry into the circumstances in which we view a star in the telescope.\r\n\r\nThe beam of rays from a star falls on the object-glass of a telescope;\r\nthose rays are parallel, and after they pass through the object-glass\r\nthey converge to a focus near the eye end of the instrument. Let us\r\nfirst suppose that the telescope is at rest; then if the telescope be\r\npointed directly towards the star, the rays will converge to a point at\r\nthe centre of the field of view where a pair of cross wires are placed,\r\nwhose intersection defines the axis of the telescope. The case will,\r\nhowever, be altered if the telescope be moved after the light has passed\r\nthrough the objective; the rays of light in the interior of the tube\r\nwill pursue a direct path, as before, and will proceed to a focus at the\r\nsame precise point as before. As, however, the telescope has moved, it\r\nwill, of course, have carried with it the pair of cross wires; they will\r\nno longer be at the same point as at first, and consequently the image\r\nof the star will not now coincide with their intersection.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the telescope arises from its connection with the earth:\r\nfor as the earth hurries along at a speed of eighteen miles a second,\r\nthe telescope is necessarily displaced with this velocity. It might at\r\nfirst be thought, that in the incredibly small fraction of time\r\nnecessary for light to pass from the object-glass to the eye-piece, the\r\nchange in the position of the telescope must be too minute to be\r\nappreciable. Let us suppose, for instance, that the star is situated\r\nnear the pole of the ecliptic, then the telescope will be conveyed by\r\nthe earth's motion in a direction perpendicular to its length. If the\r\ntube of the instrument be about twenty feet long, it can be readily\r\ndemonstrated that during the time the light travels down the tube the\r\nmovement of the earth will convey the telescope through a distance of\r\nabout one-fortieth of an inch.[42] This is a quantity very distinctly\r\nmeasurable with the magnifying power of the eye-piece, and hence this\r\nderangement of the star's place is very appreciable. It therefore\r\nfollows that if we wish the star to be shown at the centre of the\r\ninstrument, the telescope is not to be pointed directly at the star, as\r\nit would have to be were the earth at rest, but the telescope must be\r\npointed a little in advance of the star's true position; and as we\r\ndetermine the apparent place of the star by the direction in which the\r\ntelescope is pointed, it follows that the apparent place of the star is\r\naltered by the motion of the earth.\r\n\r\nEvery circumstance of the change in the star's place admits of complete\r\nexplanation in this manner. Take, for instance, the small circular path\r\nwhich each star appears to describe. We shall, for simplicity, refer\r\nonly to a star at the pole of the ecliptic. Suppose that the telescope\r\nis pointed truly to the place of the star, then, as we have shown, the\r\nimage of the star will be at a distance of one-fortieth of an inch from\r\nthe cross wires. This distance will remain constant, but each night the\r\ndirection of the star from the cross wires will change, so that in the\r\ncourse of the year it completes a circle, and returns to its original\r\nposition. We shall not pursue the calculations relative to other stars;\r\nsuffice it here to say that the movement of the earth has been found\r\nadequate to account for the phenomena, and thus the doctrine of the\r\naberration of light is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nIt remains to allude to one point of the utmost interest and importance.\r\nWe have seen that the magnitude of the aberration can be measured by\r\nastronomical observation. The amount of this aberration depends upon the\r\nvelocity of light, and on the velocity with which the earth's motion is\r\nperformed. We can measure the velocity of light by independent\r\nmeasurements, in the manner already explained in Chapter XII. We are\r\nthus enabled to calculate what the velocity of the earth must be, for\r\nthere is only one particular velocity for the earth which, when combined\r\nwith the measured velocity of light, will give the measured value of\r\naberration. The velocity of the earth being thus ascertained, and the\r\nlength of the year being known, it is easy to find the circumference of\r\nthe earth's path, and therefore its radius; that is, the distance from\r\nthe earth to the sun.\r\n\r\nHere is indeed a singular result, and one which shows how profoundly the\r\nvarious phenomena of science are interwoven. We make experiments in our\r\nlaboratory, and find the velocity of light. We observe the fixed stars,\r\nand measure the aberration. We combine these results, and deduce\r\ntherefrom the distance from the earth to the sun! Although this method\r\nof finding the sun's distance is one of very great elegance, and admits\r\nof a certain amount of precision, yet it cannot be relied upon as a\r\nperfectly unimpeachable method of deducing the great constant. A perfect\r\nmethod must be based on the operations of mere surveying, and ought not\r\nto involve recondite physical considerations. We cannot, however, fail\r\nto regard the discovery of aberration by Bradley as a most pleasing and\r\nbeautiful achievement, for it not only greatly improves the calculations\r\nof practical astronomy, but links together several physical phenomena of\r\nthe greatest interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ASTRONOMICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Heat and Astronomy--Distribution of Heat--The Presence of Heat in\r\n     the Earth--Heat in other Celestial Bodies--Varieties of\r\n     Temperature--The Law of Cooling--The Heat of the Sun--Can its\r\n     Temperature be Measured?--Radiation connected with the Sun's\r\n     Bulk--Can the Sun be Exhausting his Resources?--No marked Change\r\n     has occurred--Geological Evidence as to the Changes of the Sun's\r\n     Heat Doubtful--The Cooling of the Sun--The Sun cannot be merely an\r\n     Incandescent Solid Cooling--Combustion will not Explain the\r\n     Matter--Some Heat is obtained from Meteoric Matter, but this is not\r\n     Adequate to the Maintenance of the Sun's Heat--The Contraction of a\r\n     Heated Globe of Gas--An Apparent Paradox--The Doctrine of\r\n     Energy--The Nebular Theory--Evidence in Support of this\r\n     Theory--Sidereal Evidence of the Nebular Theory--Herschel's View of\r\n     Sidereal Aggregation--The Nebulæ do not Exhibit Changes within the\r\n     Limits of our Observation.\r\n\r\nThat a portion of a work on astronomy should bear the title placed at\r\nthe head of this chapter will perhaps strike some of our readers as\r\nunusual, if not actually inappropriate. Is not heat, it may be said, a\r\nquestion merely of experimental physics? and how can it be legitimately\r\nintroduced into a treatise upon the heavenly bodies and their movements?\r\nWhatever weight such objections might have once had need not now be\r\nconsidered. The recent researches on heat have shown not only that heat\r\nhas important bearings on astronomy, but that it has really been one of\r\nthe chief agents by which the universe has been moulded into its actual\r\nform. At the present time no work on astronomy could be complete without\r\nsome account of the remarkable connection between the laws of heat and\r\nthe astronomical consequences which follow from those laws.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the planetary motions and the laws of Kepler, or in\r\ndiscussing the movements of the moon, the proper motions of the stars,\r\nor the revolutions of the binary stars, we proceed on the supposition\r\nthat the bodies we are dealing with are rigid particles, and the\r\nquestion as to whether these particles are hot or cold does not seem to\r\nhave any especial bearing. No doubt the ordinary periodic phenomena of\r\nour system, such as the revolution of the planets in conformity with\r\nKepler's laws, will be observed for countless ages, whether the planets\r\nbe hot or cold, or whatever may be the heat of the sun. It must,\r\nhowever, be admitted that the laws of heat introduce certain\r\nmodifications into the statement of these laws. The effects of heat may\r\nnot be immediately perceptible, but they exist--they are constantly\r\nacting; and in the progress of time they are adequate to effecting the\r\nmightiest changes throughout the universe.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly recapitulate the circumstances of our system which give\r\nto heat its potency. Look first at our earth, which at present seems--on\r\nits surface, at all events--to be a body devoid of internal heat; a\r\ncloser examination will dispel this idea. Have we not the phenomena of\r\nvolcanoes, of geysers, and of hot springs, which show that in the\r\ninterior of the earth heat must exist in far greater intensity than we\r\nfind on the surface? These phenomena are found in widely different\r\nregions of the earth. Their origin is, no doubt, involved in a good deal\r\nof obscurity, but yet no one can deny that they indicate vast reservoirs\r\nof heat. It would indeed seem that heat is to be found everywhere in the\r\ndeep inner regions of the earth. If we take a thermometer down a deep\r\nmine, we find it records a temperature higher than at the surface. The\r\ndeeper we descend the higher is the temperature; and if the same rate of\r\nprogress should be maintained through those depths of the earth which we\r\nare not able to penetrate, it can be demonstrated that at twenty or\r\nthirty miles below the surface the temperature must be as great as that\r\nof red-hot iron.\r\n\r\nWe find in the other celestial bodies abundant evidence of the present\r\nor the past existence of heat. Our moon, as we have already mentioned,\r\naffords a very striking instance of a body which must once have been\r\nvery highly heated. The extraordinary volcanoes on its surface place\r\nthis beyond any doubt. It is equally true that those volcanoes have\r\nbeen silent for ages, so that, whatever may be the interior condition of\r\nthe moon, the surface has now cooled down. Extending our view further,\r\nwe see in the great planets Jupiter and Saturn evidence that they are\r\nstill endowed with a temperature far in excess of that which the earth\r\nhas retained; while, when we look at our sun, we see a body in a state\r\nof brilliant incandescence, and glowing with a fervour to which we\r\ncannot approximate in our mightiest furnaces. The various fixed stars\r\nare bodies which glow with heat, like our sun; while we have in the\r\nnebulæ objects the existence of which is hardly intelligible to us,\r\nunless we admit that they are possessed of heat.\r\n\r\nFrom this rapid survey of the different bodies in our universe one\r\nconclusion is obvious. We may have great doubts as to the actual\r\ntemperature of any individual body of the system; but it cannot be\r\ndoubted that there is a wide range of temperature among the different\r\nbodies. Some are hotter than others. The stars and suns are perhaps the\r\nhottest of all; but it is not improbable that they may be immeasurably\r\noutnumbered by the cold and dark bodies of the universe, which are to us\r\ninvisible, and only manifest their existence in an indirect and casual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe law of cooling tells us that every body radiates heat, and that the\r\nquantity of heat which it radiates increases when the temperature of the\r\nbody increases relatively to the surrounding medium. This law appears to\r\nbe universal. It is obeyed on the earth, and it would seem that it must\r\nbe equally obeyed by every other body in space. We thus see that each of\r\nthe planets and each of the stars is continuously pouring forth in all\r\ndirections a never-ceasing stream of heat. This radiation of heat is\r\nproductive of very momentous consequences. Let us study them, for\r\ninstance, in the case of the sun.\r\n\r\nOur great luminary emits an incessant flood of radiant heat in all\r\ndirections. A minute fraction of that heat is intercepted by our earth,\r\nand is, directly or indirectly, the source of all life, and of nearly\r\nall movement, on our earth. To pour forth heat as the sun does, it is\r\nnecessary that his temperature be enormously high. And there are some\r\nfacts which permit us to form an estimate of what that temperature must\r\nactually be.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to form any numerical statement of the actual\r\ntemperature of the sun. The intensity of that temperature vastly\r\ntranscends the greatest artificial heat, and any attempt to clothe such\r\nestimates in figures is necessarily very precarious. But assuming the\r\ngreatest artificial temperature to be about 4,000° Fahr., we shall\r\nprobably be well within the truth if we state the effective temperature\r\nof the sun to be about 14,000° Fahr. This is the result of a recent\r\ninvestigation by Messrs. Wilson and Gray, which seems to be entitled to\r\nconsiderable weight.\r\n\r\nThe copious outflow of heat from the sun corresponds with its enormous\r\ntemperature. We can express the amount of heat in various ways, but it\r\nmust be remembered that considerable uncertainty still attaches to such\r\nmeasurements. The old method of measuring heat by the quantity of ice\r\nmelted may be used as an illustration. It is computed that a shell of\r\nice 43-1/2 feet thick surrounding the whole sun would in one minute be\r\nmelted by the sun's heat underneath. A somewhat more elegant\r\nillustration was also given by Sir John Herschel, who showed that if a\r\ncylindrical glacier 45 miles in diameter were to be continually flowing\r\ninto the sun with the velocity of light, the end of that glacier would\r\nbe melted as quickly as it advanced. From each square foot in the\r\nsurface of the sun emerges a quantity of heat as great as could be\r\nproduced by the daily combustion of sixteen tons of coal. This is,\r\nindeed, an amount of heat which, properly transformed into work, would\r\nkeep an engine of many hundreds of horse-power running from one year's\r\nend to the other. The heat radiated from a few acres on the sun would be\r\nadequate to drive all the steam engines in the world. When we reflect on\r\nthe vast intensity of the radiation from each square foot of the sun's\r\nsurface, and when we combine with this the stupendous dimensions of the\r\nsun, imagination fails to realise how vast must be the actual\r\nexpenditure of heat.\r\n\r\nIn presence of the prodigal expenditure of the sun's heat, we are\r\ntempted to ask a question which has the most vital interest for the\r\nearth and its inhabitants. We live from hour to hour by the sun's\r\nsplendid generosity; and, therefore, it is important for us to know what\r\nsecurity we possess for the continuance of his favours. When we witness\r\nthe terrific disbursement of the sun's heat each hour, we are compelled\r\nto ask whether our great luminary may not be exhausting its resources;\r\nand if so, what are the prospects of the future? This question we can\r\npartly answer. The whole subject is indeed of surpassing interest, and\r\nredolent with the spirit of modern scientific thought.\r\n\r\nOur first attempt to examine this question must lie in an appeal to the\r\nfacts which are attainable. We want to know whether the sun is showing\r\nany symptoms of decay. Are the days as warm and as bright now as they\r\nwere last year, ten years ago, one hundred years ago? We can find no\r\nevidence of any change since the beginning of authentic records. If the\r\nsun's heat had perceptibly changed within the last two thousand years,\r\nwe should expect to find corresponding changes in the distribution of\r\nplants and of animals; but no such changes have been detected. There is\r\nno reason to think that the climate of ancient Greece or of ancient Rome\r\nwas appreciably different from the climates of the Greece and the Rome\r\nthat we know at this day. The vine and the olive grow now where they\r\ngrew two thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, lay too much stress on this argument; for the\r\neffects of slight changes in the sun's heat may have been neutralised by\r\ncorresponding adaptations in the pliable organisms of cultivated plants.\r\nAll we can certainly conclude is that no marked change has taken place\r\nin the heat of the sun during historical time. But when we come to look\r\nback into much earlier ages, we find copious evidence that the earth has\r\nundergone great changes in climate. Geological records can on this\r\nquestion hardly be misinterpreted. Yet it is curious to note that these\r\nchanges are hardly such as could arise from the gradual exhaustion of\r\nthe sun's radiation. No doubt, in very early times we have evidence\r\nthat the earth's climate must have been much warmer than at present. We\r\nhad the great carboniferous period, when the temperature must almost\r\nhave been tropical in Arctic latitudes. Yet it is hardly possible to\r\ncite this as evidence that the sun was then much more powerful; for we\r\nare immediately reminded of the glacial period, when our temperate zones\r\nwere overlaid by sheets of solid ice, as Northern Greenland is at\r\npresent. If we suppose the sun to have been hotter than it is at present\r\nto account for the vegetation which produced coal, then we ought to\r\nassume the sun to be colder than it is now to account for the glacial\r\nperiod. It is not reasonable to attribute such phenomena to fluctuations\r\nin the radiation from the sun. The glacial periods prove that we cannot\r\nappeal to geology in aid of the doctrine that a secular cooling of the\r\nsun is now in progress. The geological variations of climate may have\r\nbeen caused by changes in the earth itself, or by changes in its actual\r\norbit; but however they have been caused, they hardly tell us much with\r\nregard to the past history of our sun.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the sun has lasted countless ages; yet we cannot credit the\r\nsun with the power of actually creating heat. We must apply to the\r\ntremendous mass of the sun the same laws which we have found by our\r\nexperiments on the earth. We must ask, whence comes the heat sufficient\r\nto supply this lavish outgoing? Let us briefly recount the various\r\nsuppositions that have been made.\r\n\r\nPlace two red-hot spheres of iron side by side, a large one and a small\r\none. They have been taken from the same fire; they were both equally\r\nhot; they are both cooling, but the small sphere cools more rapidly. It\r\nspeedily becomes dark, while the large sphere is still glowing, and\r\nwould continue to do so for some minutes. The larger the sphere, the\r\nlonger it will take to cool; and hence it has been supposed that a\r\nmighty sphere of the prodigious dimensions of our sun would, if once\r\nheated, cool gradually, but the duration of the cooling would be so long\r\nthat for thousands and for millions of years it could continue to be a\r\nsource of light and heat to the revolving system of planets. This\r\nsuggestion will not bear the test of arithmetic. If the sun had no\r\nsource of heat beyond that indicated by its high temperature, we can\r\nshow that radiation would cool the sun a few degrees every year. Two\r\nthousand years would then witness a very great decrease in the sun's\r\nheat. We are certain that no such decrease can have taken place. The\r\nsource of the sun's radiation cannot be found in the mere cooling of an\r\nincandescent mass.\r\n\r\nCan the fires in the sun be maintained by combustion, analogous to that\r\nwhich goes on in our furnaces? Here we would seem to have a source of\r\ngigantic heat; but arithmetic also disposes of this supposition. We know\r\nthat if the sun were made of even solid coal itself, and if that coal\r\nwere burning in pure oxygen, the heat that could be produced would only\r\nsuffice for 6,000 years. If the sun which shone upon the builders of the\r\ngreat Pyramid had been solid coal from surface to centre, it must by\r\nthis time have been in great part burned away in the attempt to maintain\r\nits present rate of expenditure. We are thus forced to look to other\r\nsources for the supply of the sun's heat, since neither the heat of\r\nincandescence nor the heat of combustion will suffice.\r\n\r\nThere is probably--indeed, we may say certainly--one external source\r\nfrom which the heat of the sun is recruited. It will be necessary for us\r\nto consider this source with some care, though I think we shall find it\r\nto be merely an auxiliary of comparatively trifling moment. According to\r\nthis view, the solar heat receives occasional accessions from the fall\r\nupon the sun's surface of masses of meteoric matter. There can be hardly\r\na doubt that such masses do fall upon the sun; there is certainly no\r\ndoubt that if they do, the sun must gain some heat thereby. We have\r\nexperience on the earth of a very interesting kind, which illustrates\r\nthe development of heat by meteoric matter. There lies a world of\r\nphilosophy in a shooting star. Some of these myriad objects rush into\r\nour atmosphere and are lost; others, no doubt, rush into the sun with\r\nthe same result. We also admit that the descent of a shooting star into\r\nthe atmosphere of the sun must be attended with a flash of light and of\r\nheat. The heat acquired by the earth from the flashing of the shooting\r\nstars through our air is quite insensible. It has been supposed,\r\nhowever, that the heat accruing to the sun from the same cause may be\r\nquite sensible--nay, it has been even supposed that the sun may be\r\nre-invigorated from this source.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we must apply the cold principles of weights and measures\r\nto estimate the plausibility of this suggestion. We first calculate the\r\nactual weight of meteoric indraught to the sun which would be adequate\r\nto sustain the fires of the sun at their present vigour. The mass of\r\nmatter that would be required is so enormous that we cannot usefully\r\nexpress it by imperial weights; we must deal with masses of imposing\r\nmagnitude. It fortunately happens that the weight of our moon is a\r\nconvenient unit. Conceive that our moon--a huge globe, 2,000 miles in\r\ndiameter--were crushed into a myriad of fragments, and that these\r\nfragments were allowed to rain in on the sun; there can be no doubt that\r\nthis tremendous meteoric shower would contribute to the sun rather more\r\nheat than would be required to supply his radiation for a whole year. If\r\nwe take our earth itself, conceive it comminuted into dust, and allow\r\nthat dust to fall on the sun as a mighty shower, each fragment would\r\ninstantly give out a quantity of heat, and the whole would add to the\r\nsun a supply of heat adequate to sustain the present rate of radiation\r\nfor nearly one hundred years. The mighty mass of Jupiter treated in the\r\nsame way would generate a meteoric display greater in the ratio in which\r\nthe mass of Jupiter exceeds the mass of earth. Were Jupiter to fall into\r\nthe sun, enough heat would be thereby produced to scorch the whole solar\r\nsystem; while all the planets together would be capable of producing\r\nheat which, if properly economised, would supply the radiation of the\r\nsun for 45,000 years.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that though the moon could supply one year's heat,\r\nand Jupiter 30,000 years' heat, yet the practical question is not\r\nwhether the solar system could supply the sun's heat, but whether it\r\ndoes. Is it likely that meteors equal in mass to the moon fall into the\r\nsun every year? This is the real question, and I think we are bound to\r\nreply to it in the negative. It can be shown that the quantity of\r\nmeteors which could be caught by the sun in any one year can be only an\r\nexcessively minute fraction of the total amount. If, therefore, a\r\nmoon-weight of meteors were caught every year, there must be an\r\nincredible mass of meteoric matter roaming at large through the system.\r\nThere must be so many meteors that the earth would be incessantly pelted\r\nwith them, and heated to such a degree as to be rendered uninhabitable.\r\nThere are also other reasons which preclude the supposition that a\r\nstupendous quantity of meteoric matter exists in the vicinity of the\r\nsun. Such matter would produce an appreciable effect on the movement of\r\nthe planet Mercury. There are, no doubt, some irregularities in the\r\nmovements of Mercury not yet fully explained, but these irregularities\r\nare very much less than would be the case if meteoric matter existed in\r\nquantity adequate to the sustentation of the sun. Astronomers, then,\r\nbelieve that though meteors may provide a rate in aid of the sun's\r\ncurrent expenditure, yet that the greater portion of that expenditure\r\nmust be defrayed from other resources.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the achievements of modern science to have effected the\r\nsolution of the problem--to have shown how it is that, notwithstanding\r\nthe stupendous radiation, the sun still maintains its temperature. The\r\nquestion is not free from difficulty in its exposition, but the matter\r\nis one of such very great importance that we are compelled to make the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine a vast globe of heated gas in space. This is not an\r\nentirely gratuitous supposition, inasmuch as there are globes apparently\r\nof this character; they have been already alluded to as planetary\r\nnebulæ. This globe will radiate heat, and we shall suppose that it emits\r\nmore heat than it receives from the radiation of other bodies. The globe\r\nwill accordingly lose heat, or what is equivalent thereto, but it will\r\nbe incorrect to assume that the globe will necessarily fall in\r\ntemperature. That the contrary is, indeed, the case is a result almost\r\nparadoxical at the first glance; but yet it can be shown to be a\r\nnecessary consequence of the laws of heat and of gases.\r\n\r\nLet us fix our attention on a portion of the gas lying on the surface\r\nof the globe. This is, of course, attracted by all the rest of the\r\nglobe, and thus tends in towards the centre of the globe. If equilibrium\r\nsubsists, this tendency must be neutralised by the pressure of the gas\r\nbeneath; so that the greater the gravitation, the greater is the\r\npressure. When the globe of gas loses heat by radiation, let us suppose\r\nthat it grows colder--that its temperature accordingly falls; then,\r\nsince the pressure of a gas decreases when the temperature falls, the\r\npressure beneath the superficial layer of the gas will decrease, while\r\nthe gravitation is unaltered. The consequence will inevitably be that\r\nthe gravitation will now conquer the pressure, and the globe of gas will\r\naccordingly contract. There is, however, another way in which we can\r\nlook at the matter. We know that heat is equivalent to energy, so that\r\nwhen the globe radiates forth heat, it must expend energy. A part of the\r\nenergy of the globe will be due to its temperature; but another, and in\r\nsome respects a more important, part is that due to the separation of\r\nits particles. If we allow the particles to come closer together we\r\nshall diminish the energy due to separation, and the energy thus set\r\nfree can take the form of heat. But this drawing in of the particles\r\nnecessarily involves a shrinking of the globe.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the remarkable consequence, which seems to have a very\r\nimportant application in astronomy. As the globe contracts, a part of\r\nits energy of separation is changed into heat; that heat is partly\r\nradiated away, but not so rapidly as it is produced by the contraction.\r\nThe consequence is, that although the globe is really losing heat and\r\nreally contracting, yet that its temperature is actually rising.[43] A\r\nsimple case will suffice to demonstrate this result, paradoxical as it\r\nmay at first seem. Let us suppose that by contraction of the sphere it\r\nhad diminished to one-half its diameter; and let us fix our attention on\r\na cubic inch of the gaseous matter in any point of the mass. After the\r\ncontraction has taken place each edge of the cube would be reduced to\r\nhalf an inch, and the volume would therefore be reduced to one-eighth\r\npart of its original amount. The law of gases tells us that if the\r\ntemperature be unaltered the pressure varies inversely as the volume,\r\nand consequently the internal pressure in the cube would in that case be\r\nincreased eightfold. As, however, in the case before us, the distance\r\nbetween every two particles is reduced to one-half, it will follow that\r\nthe gravitation between every two particles is increased fourfold, and\r\nas the area is also reduced to one-fourth, it will follow that the\r\npressure inside the reduced cube is increased sixteenfold; but we have\r\nalready seen that with a constant temperature it only increases\r\neightfold, and hence the temperature cannot be constant, but must rise\r\nwith the contraction.\r\n\r\nWe thus have the somewhat astonishing result that a gaseous globe in\r\nspace radiating heat, and thereby growing smaller, is all the time\r\nactually increasing in temperature. But, it may be said, surely this\r\ncannot go on for ever. Are we to suppose that the gaseous mass will go\r\non contracting and contracting with a temperature ever fiercer and\r\nfiercer, and actually radiating out more and more heat the more it\r\nloses? Where lies the limit to such a prospect? As the body contracts,\r\nits density must increase, until it either becomes a liquid, or a solid,\r\nor, at any rate, until it ceases to obey the laws of a purely gaseous\r\nbody which we have supposed. Once these laws cease to be observed the\r\nargument disappears; the loss of heat may then really be attended with a\r\nloss of temperature, until in the course of time the body has sunk to\r\nthe temperature of space itself.\r\n\r\nIt is not assumed that this reasoning can be applied in all its\r\ncompleteness to the present state of the sun. The sun's density is now\r\nso great that the laws of gases cannot be there strictly followed. There\r\nis, however, good reason to believe that the sun was once more gaseous\r\nthan at present; possibly at one time he may have been quite gaseous\r\nenough to admit of this reasoning in all its fulness. At present the sun\r\nappears to be in some intermediate stage of its progress from the\r\ngaseous condition to the solid condition. We cannot, therefore, say\r\nthat the temperature of the sun is now increasing in correspondence with\r\nthe process of contraction. This may be true or it may not be true; we\r\nhave no means of deciding the point. We may, however, feel certain that\r\nthe sun is still sufficiently gaseous to experience in some degree the\r\nrise of temperature associated with the contraction. That rise in\r\ntemperature may be partly or wholly obscured by the fall in temperature\r\nwhich would be the more obvious consequence of the radiation of heat\r\nfrom the partially solid body. It will, however, be manifest that the\r\ncooling of the sun may be enormously protracted if the fall of\r\ntemperature from the one cause be nearly compensated by the rise of\r\ntemperature from the other. It can hardly be doubted that in this we\r\nfind the real explanation of the fact that we have no historical\r\nevidence of any appreciable alteration in the radiation of heat from the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThis question is one of such interest that it may be worth while to look\r\nat it from a slightly different point of view. The sun contains a\r\ncertain store of energy, part of which is continually disappearing in\r\nthe form of radiant heat. The energy remaining in the sun is partly\r\ntransformed in character; some of it is transformed into heat, which\r\ngoes wholly or partly to supply the loss by radiation. The total energy\r\nof the sun must, however, be decreasing; and hence it would seem the sun\r\nmust at some time or other have its energy exhausted, and cease to be a\r\nsource of light and of heat. It is true that the rate at which the sun\r\ncontracts is very slow. We are, indeed, not able to measure with\r\ncertainty the decrease in the sun's bulk. It is a quantity so minute,\r\nthat the contraction since the birth of accurate astronomy is not large\r\nenough to be perceptible in our telescopes. It is, however, possible to\r\ncompute what the contraction of the sun's bulk must be, on the\r\nsupposition that the energy lost by that contraction just suffices to\r\nsupply the daily radiation of heat. The change is very small when we\r\nconsider the present size of the sun. At the present time the sun's\r\ndiameter is about 860,000 miles. If each year this diameter decreases by\r\nabout 300 feet, sufficient energy will be yielded to account for the\r\nentire radiation. This gradual decrease is always in progress.\r\n\r\nThese considerations are of considerable interest when we apply them\r\nretrospectively. If it be true that the sun is at this moment shrinking,\r\nthen in past times his globe must have been greater than it is at\r\npresent. Assuming the figures already given, it follows that one hundred\r\nyears ago the diameter of the sun must have been nearly six miles\r\ngreater than it is now; one thousand years ago the diameter was\r\nfifty-seven miles greater; ten thousand years ago the diameter of the\r\nsun was five hundred and seventy miles greater than it is to-day. When\r\nman first trod this earth it would seem that the sun must have been many\r\nhundreds, perhaps many thousands, of miles greater than it is at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, over-estimate the significance of this statement.\r\nThe diameter of the sun is so great, that a diminution of 10,000 miles\r\nwould be but little more than the hundredth part of its diameter. If it\r\nwere suddenly to shrink to the extent of 10,000 miles, the change would\r\nnot be appreciable to ordinary observation, though a much smaller change\r\nwould not elude delicate astronomical measurement. It does not\r\nnecessarily follow that the climates on our earth in these early times\r\nmust have been very different from those which we find at this day, for\r\nthe question of climate depends upon other matters besides sunbeams.\r\n\r\nYet we need not abruptly stop our retrospect at any epoch, however\r\nremote. We may go back earlier and earlier, through the long ages which\r\ngeologists claim for the deposition of the stratified rocks; and back\r\nagain still further, to those very earliest epochs when life began to\r\ndawn on the earth. Still we can find no reason to suppose that the law\r\nof the sun's decreasing heat is not maintained; and thus we would seem\r\nbound by our present knowledge to suppose that the sun grows larger and\r\nlarger the further our retrospect extends. We cannot assume that the\r\nrate of that growth is always the same. No such assumption is required;\r\nit is sufficient for our purpose that we find the sun growing larger\r\nand larger the further we peer back into the remote abyss of time past.\r\nIf the present order of things in our universe has lasted long enough,\r\nthen it would seem that there was a time when the sun must have been\r\ntwice as large as it is at present; it must once have been ten times as\r\nlarge. How long ago that was no one can venture to say. But we cannot\r\nstop at the stage when the sun was even ten times as large as it is at\r\npresent; the arguments will still apply in earlier ages. We see the sun\r\nswelling and swelling, with a corresponding decrease in its density,\r\nuntil at length we find, instead of our sun as we know it, a mighty\r\nnebula filling a gigantic region of space.\r\n\r\nSuch is, in fact, the doctrine of the origin of our system which has\r\nbeen advanced in that celebrated speculation known as the nebular theory\r\nof Laplace. Nor can it be ever more than a speculation; it cannot be\r\nestablished by observation, nor can it be proved by calculation. It is\r\nmerely a conjecture, more or less plausible, but perhaps in some degree\r\nnecessarily true, if our present laws of heat, as we understand them,\r\nadmit of the extreme application here required, and if also the present\r\norder of things has reigned for sufficient time without the intervention\r\nof any influence at present unknown to us. This nebular theory is not\r\nconfined to the history of our sun. Precisely similar reasoning may be\r\nextended to the individual planets: the farther we look back, the hotter\r\nand the hotter does the whole system become. It has been thought that if\r\nwe could look far enough back, we should see the earth too hot for life;\r\nback further still, we should find the earth and all the planets\r\nred-hot; and back further still, to an exceedingly remote epoch, when\r\nthe planets would be heated just as much as our sun is now. In a still\r\nearlier stage the whole solar system is thought to have been one vast\r\nmass of glowing gas, from which the present forms of the sun, with the\r\nplanets and their satellites, have been gradually evolved. We cannot be\r\nsure that the course of events has been what is here indicated; but\r\nthere are sufficient grounds for thinking that this doctrine\r\nsubstantially represents what has actually occurred.\r\n\r\nMany of the features in the solar system harmonise with the supposition\r\nthat the origin of the system has been that suggested by the nebular\r\ntheory. We have already had occasion in an earlier chapter to allude to\r\nthe fact that all the planets perform their revolutions around the sun\r\nin the same direction. It is also to be observed that the rotation of\r\nthe planets on their axes, as well as the movements of the satellites\r\naround their primaries, all follow the same law, with two slight\r\nexceptions in the case of the Uranian and Neptunian systems. A\r\ncoincidence so remarkable naturally suggests the necessity for some\r\nphysical explanation. Such an explanation is offered by the nebular\r\ntheory. Suppose that countless ages ago a mighty nebula was slowly\r\nrotating and slowly contracting. In the process of contraction, portions\r\nof the condensed matter of the nebula would be left behind. These\r\nportions would still revolve around the central mass, and each portion\r\nwould rotate on its axis in the same direction. As the process of\r\ncontraction proceeded, it would follow from dynamical principles that\r\nthe velocity of rotation would increase; and thus at length these\r\nportions would consolidate into planets, while the central mass would\r\ngradually contract to form the sun. By a similar process on a smaller\r\nscale the systems of satellites were evolved from the contracting\r\nprimary. These satellites would also revolve in the same direction, and\r\nthus the characteristic features of the solar system could be accounted\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe nebular origin of the solar system receives considerable countenance\r\nfrom the study of the sidereal heavens. We have already dwelt upon the\r\nresemblance between the sun and the stars. If, then, our sun has passed\r\nthrough such changes as the nebular theory requires, may we not\r\nanticipate that similar phenomena should be met with in other stars? If\r\nthis be so, it is reasonable to suppose that the evolution of some of\r\nthe stars may not have progressed so far as has that of the sun, and\r\nthus we may be able actually to witness stars in the earlier phases of\r\ntheir development. Let us see how far the telescope responds to these\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\nThe field of view of a large telescope usually discloses a number of\r\nstars scattered over a black background of sky; but the blackness of\r\nthe background is not uniform: the practised eye of the skilled observer\r\nwill detect in some parts of the heavens a faint luminosity. This will\r\nsometimes be visible over the whole extent of the field, or it may even\r\noccupy several fields. Years may pass on, and still there is no\r\nperceptible change. There can be no illusion, and the conclusion is\r\nirresistible that the object is a stupendous mass of faintly luminous\r\nglowing gas or vapour. This is the simplest type of nebula; it is\r\ncharacterised by extreme faintness, and seems composed of matter of the\r\nutmost tenuity. On the other hand we are occasionally presented with the\r\nbeautiful and striking phenomenon of a definite and brilliant star\r\nsurrounded by a luminous atmosphere. Between these two extreme types of\r\na faint diffused mass on the one hand, and a bright star with a nebula\r\nsurrounding it on the other, a graduated series of various other nebulæ\r\ncan be arranged. We thus have a series of links passing by imperceptible\r\ngradations from the most faintly diffused nebulæ on the one side, into\r\nstars on the other.\r\n\r\nThe nebulæ seemed to Herschel to be vast masses of phosphorescent\r\nvapour. This vapour gradually cools down, and ultimately condenses into\r\na star, or a cluster of stars. When the varied forms of nebulæ were\r\nclassified, it almost seemed as if the different links in the process\r\ncould be actually witnessed. In the vast faint nebulæ the process of\r\ncondensation had just begun; in the smaller and brighter nebulæ the\r\ncondensation had advanced farther; while in others, the star, or stars,\r\narising from the condensation had already become visible.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be asked, how did Herschel know this? what is his evidence?\r\nLet us answer this question by an illustration. Go into a forest, and\r\nlook at a noble old oak which has weathered the storm for centuries;\r\nhave we any doubt that the oak-tree was once a young small plant, and\r\nthat it grew stage by stage until it reached maturity? Yet no one has\r\never followed an oak-tree through its various stages; the brief span of\r\nhuman life has not been long enough to do so. The reason why we believe\r\nthe oak-tree to have passed through all these stages is, because we are\r\nfamiliar with oak-trees of every gradation in size, from the seedling\r\nup to the noble veteran. Having seen this gradation in a vast multitude\r\nof trees, we are convinced that each individual passes through all these\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nIt was by a similar train of reasoning that Herschel was led to adopt\r\nthe view of the origin of the stars which we have endeavoured to\r\ndescribe. The astronomer's life is not long enough, the life of the\r\nhuman race might not be long enough, to watch the process by which a\r\nnebula condenses down so as to form a solid body. But by looking at one\r\nnebula after another, the astronomer thinks he is able to detect the\r\nvarious stages which connect the nebula in its original form with the\r\nfinal form. He is thus led to believe that each of the nebulæ passes, in\r\nthe course of ages, through these stages. And thus Herschel adopted the\r\nopinion that stars--some, many, or all--have each originated from what\r\nwas once a glowing nebula.\r\n\r\nSuch a speculation may captivate the imagination, but it must be\r\ncarefully distinguished from the truths of astronomy, properly so\r\ncalled. Remote posterity may perhaps obtain evidence on the subject\r\nwhich to us is inaccessible: our knowledge of nebulæ is too recent.\r\nThere has not yet been time enough to detect any appreciable changes:\r\nfor the study of nebulæ can only be said to date from Messier's\r\nCatalogue in 1771.\r\n\r\nSince Herschel's time, no doubt, many careful drawings and observations\r\nof the nebulæ have been obtained; but still the interval has been much\r\ntoo short, and the earlier observations are too imperfect, to enable any\r\nchanges in the nebulæ to be investigated with sufficient accuracy. If\r\nthe human race lasts for very many centuries, and if our present\r\nobservations are preserved during that time for comparison, then\r\nHerschel's theory may perhaps be satisfactorily tested.\r\n\r\nA hundred years have passed since Laplace, with some diffidence, set\r\nforth his hypothesis as to the mode of formation of the solar system. On\r\nthe whole it must be said that this \"nebular hypothesis\" has stood the\r\ntest of advancing science well, though some slight modifications have\r\nbecome necessary in the light of more recent discoveries. Laplace (and\r\nHerschel also) seems to have considered a primitive nebula to consist of\r\na \"fiery mist\" or glowing gas at a very high temperature. But this is by\r\nno means necessary, as we have seen that the gradual contraction of the\r\nvast mass supplies energy which may be converted into heat, and the\r\nspectroscopic evidence seems also to point to the existence of a\r\nmoderate temperature in the gaseous nebulæ, which must be considered to\r\nbe representatives of the hypothetical primitive chaos out of which our\r\nsun and planets have been evolved. Another point which has been\r\nreconsidered is the formation of the various planets. It was formerly\r\nthought that the rotation of the original mass had by degrees caused a\r\nnumber of rings of different dimensions to be separated from the central\r\npart, the material of which rings in time collected into single planets.\r\nThe ring of Saturn was held to be a proof of this process, since we here\r\nhave a ring, the condensation of which into one or more satellites has\r\nsomehow been arrested. But while it is not impossible that matter in the\r\nshape of rings may have been left behind during the contraction of the\r\nnebulous mass (indeed, the minor planets between Mars and Jupiter have\r\nperhaps originated in this way), it seems likely that the larger planets\r\nwere formed from the agglomeration of matter at a point on the equator\r\nof the rotating nebula.\r\n\r\nThe actual steps of the process by which the primeval nebula became\r\ntransformed into the solar system seem to lie beyond reach of discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE TIDES.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mathematical Astronomy--Lagrange's Theories: how far they are\r\n     really True--The Solar System not Made of Rigid Bodies--Kepler's\r\n     Laws True to Observation, but not Absolutely True when the Bodies\r\n     are not Rigid--The Errors of Observation--The Tides--How the Tides\r\n     were Observed--Discovery of the Connection between the Tides and\r\n     the Moon--Solar and Lunar Tides--Work done by the Tides--Whence do\r\n     the Tides obtain the Power to do the Work?--Tides are Increasing\r\n     the Length of the Day--Limit to the Shortness of the Day--Early\r\n     History of the Earth-Moon System--Unstable Equilibrium--Ratio of\r\n     the Month to the Day--The Future Course of the System--Equality of\r\n     the Month and the Day--The Future Critical Epoch--The Constant Face\r\n     of the Moon accounted for--The other Side of the Moon--The\r\n     Satellites of Mars--Their Remarkable Motions--Have the Tides\r\n     Possessed Influence in Moulding the Solar System generally?--Moment\r\n     of Momentum--Tides have had little or no Appreciable Effect on the\r\n     Orbit of Jupiter--Conclusion.\r\n\r\nThat the great discoveries of Lagrange on the stability of the planetary\r\nsystem are correct is in one sense strictly true. No one has ever\r\nventured to impugn the mathematics of Lagrange. Given the planetary\r\nsystem in the form which Lagrange assumed and the stability of that\r\nsystem is assured for all time. There is, however, one assumption which\r\nLagrange makes, and on which his whole theory was founded: his\r\nassumption is that the planets are _rigid_ bodies.\r\n\r\nNo doubt our earth seems a rigid body. What can be more solid and\r\nunyielding than the mass of rocks and metals which form the earth, so\r\nfar as it is accessible to us? In the wide realms of space the earth is\r\nbut as a particle; it surely was a natural and a legitimate assumption\r\nto suppose that that particle was a rigid body. If the earth were\r\nabsolutely rigid--if every particle of the earth were absolutely at a\r\nfixed distance from every other particle--if under no stress of forces,\r\nand in no conceivable circumstance, the earth experienced even the\r\nminutest change of form--if the same could be said of the sun and of all\r\nthe other planets--then Lagrange's prediction of the eternal duration of\r\nour system must be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBut what are the facts of the case? Is the earth really rigid? We know\r\nfrom experiment that a rigid body in the mathematical sense of the word\r\ndoes not exist. Rocks are not rigid; steel is not rigid; even a diamond\r\nis not perfectly rigid. The whole earth is far from being rigid even on\r\nthe surface, while part of the interior is still, perhaps, more or less\r\nfluid. The earth cannot be called a perfectly rigid body; still less can\r\nthe larger bodies of our system be called rigid. Jupiter and Saturn are\r\nperhaps hardly even what could be called solid bodies. The solar system\r\nof Lagrange consisted of a rigid sun and a number of minute rigid\r\nplanets; the actual solar system consists of a sun which is in no sense\r\nrigid, and planets which are only partially so.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises as to whether the discoveries of the great\r\nmathematicians of the last century will apply, not only to the ideal\r\nsolar system which they conceived, but to the actual solar system in\r\nwhich our lot has been cast. There can be no doubt that these\r\ndiscoveries are approximately true: they are, indeed, so near the\r\nabsolute truth, that observation has not yet satisfactorily shown any\r\ndeparture from them.\r\n\r\nBut in the present state of science we can no longer overlook the\r\nimportant questions which arise when we deal with bodies not rigid in\r\nthe mathematical sense of the word. Let us, for instance, take the\r\nsimplest of the laws to which we have referred, the great law of Kepler,\r\nwhich asserts that a planet will revolve for ever in an elliptic path of\r\nwhich the sun is one focus. This is seen to be verified by actual\r\nobservation; indeed, it was established by observation before any\r\ntheoretical explanation of that movement was propounded. If, however, we\r\nstate the matter with a little more precision, we shall find that what\r\nNewton really demonstrated was, that if two _rigid_ particles attract\r\neach other by a law of force which varies with the inverse square of the\r\ndistance between the particles, then each of the particles will describe\r\nan ellipse with the common centre of gravity in the focus. The earth is,\r\nto some extent, rigid, and hence it was natural to suppose that the\r\nrelative behaviour of the earth and the sun would, to a corresponding\r\nextent, observe the simple elliptic law of Kepler; as a matter of fact,\r\nthey do observe it with such fidelity that, if we make allowance for\r\nother causes of disturbance, we cannot, even by most careful\r\nobservation, detect the slightest variation in the motion of the earth\r\narising from its want of rigidity.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a subtlety in the investigations of mathematics\r\nwhich, in this instance at all events, transcends the most delicate\r\nobservations which our instruments enable us to make. The principles of\r\nmathematics tell us that though Kepler's laws may be true for bodies\r\nwhich are absolutely and mathematically rigid, yet that if the sun or\r\nthe planets be either wholly, or even in their minutest part, devoid of\r\nperfect rigidity, then Kepler's laws can be no longer true. Do we not\r\nseem here to be in the presence of a contradiction? Observation tells us\r\nthat Kepler's laws are true in the planetary system; theory tells us\r\nthat these laws cannot be true in the planetary system, because the\r\nbodies in that system are not perfectly rigid. How is this discrepancy\r\nto be removed? Or is there really a discrepancy at all? There is not.\r\nWhen we say that Kepler's laws have been proved to be true by\r\nobservation, we must reflect on the nature of the proofs which are\r\nattainable. We observe the places of the planets with the instruments in\r\nour observatories; these places are measured by the help of our clocks\r\nand of the graduated circles on the instruments. These observations are\r\nno doubt wonderfully accurate; but they do not, they cannot, possess\r\nabsolute accuracy in the mathematical sense of the word. We can, for\r\ninstance, determine the place of a planet with such precision that it\r\nis certainly not one second of arc wrong; and one second is an extremely\r\nsmall quantity. A foot-rule placed at a distance of about forty miles\r\nsubtends an angle of a second, and it is surely a delicate achievement\r\nto measure the place of a planet, and feel confident that no error\r\ngreater than this can have intruded into our result.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the results of observation with the calculations\r\nconducted on the assumption of the truth of Kepler's laws, and when we\r\npronounce on the agreement of the observations with the calculations,\r\nthere is always a reference, more or less explicit, to the inevitable\r\nerrors of the observations. If the calculations and observations agree\r\nso closely that the differences between the two are minute enough to\r\nhave arisen in the errors inseparable from the observations, then we are\r\nsatisfied with the accordance; for, in fact, no closer agreement is\r\nattainable, or even conceivable. The influence which the want of\r\nrigidity exercises on the fulfilment of the laws of Kepler can be\r\nestimated by calculation; it is found, as might be expected, to be\r\nextremely small--so small, in fact, as to be contained within that\r\nslender margin of error by which observations are liable to be affected.\r\nWe are thus not able to discriminate by actual measurement the effects\r\ndue to the absence of rigidity; they are inextricably hid among the\r\nsmall errors of observation.\r\n\r\nThe argument on which we are to base our researches is really founded on\r\na very familiar phenomenon. There is no one who has ever visited the\r\nsea-side who is not familiar with that rise and fall of the sea which we\r\ncall the tide. Twice every twenty-four hours the sea advances on the\r\nbeach to produce high tide; twice every day the sea again retreats to\r\nproduce low tide. These tides are not merely confined to the coasts;\r\nthey penetrate for miles up the courses of rivers; they periodically\r\ninundate great estuaries. In a maritime country the tides are of the\r\nmost profound practical importance; they also possess a significance of\r\na far less obvious character, which it is our object now to investigate.\r\n\r\nThese daily pulses of the ocean have long ceased to be a mystery. It\r\nwas in the earliest times perceived that there was a connection between\r\nthe tides and the moon. Ancient writers, such as Pliny and Aristotle,\r\nhave referred to the alliance between the times of high water and the\r\nage of the moon. I think we sometimes do not give the ancient\r\nastronomers as much credit as their shrewdness really entitles them to.\r\nWe have all read--we have all been taught--that the moon and the tides\r\nare connected together; but how many of us are in a position to say that\r\nwe have actually noticed that connection by direct personal observation?\r\nThe first man who studied this matter with sufficient attention to\r\nconvince himself and to convince others of its reality must have been a\r\ngreat philosopher. We know not his name, we know not his nation, we know\r\nnot the age in which he lived; but our admiration of his discovery must\r\nbe increased by the reflection that he had not the theory of gravitation\r\nto guide him. A philosopher of the present day who had never seen the\r\nsea could still predict the necessity of tides as a consequence of the\r\nlaw of universal gravitation; but the primitive astronomer, who knew not\r\nof the invisible bond by which all bodies in the universe are drawn\r\ntogether, made a splendid--indeed, a typical--inductive discovery, when\r\nhe ascertained the relation between the moon and the tides.\r\n\r\nWe can surmise that this discovery, in all probability, first arose from\r\nthe observations of experienced navigators. In all matters of entering\r\nport or of leaving port, the state of the tide is of the utmost concern\r\nto the sailor. Even in the open sea he has sometimes to shape his course\r\nin accordance with the currents produced by the tides; or, in guiding\r\nhis course by taking soundings, he has always to bear in mind that the\r\ndepth varies with the tide. All matters relating to the tide would thus\r\ncome under his daily observation. His daily work, the success of his\r\noccupation, the security of his life, depend often on the tides; and\r\nhence he would be solicitous to learn from his observation all that\r\nwould be useful to him in the future. To the coasting sailor the\r\nquestion of the day is the time of high water. That time varies from\r\nday to day; it is an hour or more later to-morrow than to-day, and there\r\nis no very simple rule which can be enunciated. The sailor would\r\ntherefore welcome gladly any rule which would guide him in a matter of\r\nsuch importance. We can make a conjecture as to the manner in which such\r\na rule was first discovered. Let us suppose that a sailor at Calais, for\r\nexample, is making for harbour. He has a beautiful night--the moon is\r\nfull; it guides him on his way; he gets safely into harbour; and the\r\nnext morning he finds the tide high between 11 and 12.[45] He often\r\nrepeats the same voyage, but he finds sometimes a low and inconvenient\r\ntide in the morning. At length, however, it occurs to him that _when he\r\nhas a moonlight night_ he has a high tide at 11. This occurs once or\r\ntwice: he thinks it but a chance coincidence. It occurs again and again.\r\nAt length he finds it always occurs. He tells the rule to other sailors;\r\nthey try it too. It is invariably found that when the moon is full, the\r\nhigh tide always recurs at the same hour at the same place. The\r\nconnection between the moon and the tide is thus established, and the\r\nintelligent sailor will naturally compare other phases of the moon with\r\nthe times of high water. He finds, for example, that the moon at the\r\nfirst quarter always gives high water at the same hour of the day; and\r\nfinally, he obtains a practical rule, by which, from the state of the\r\nmoon, he can at once tell the time when the tide will be high at the\r\nport where his occupation lies. A diligent observer will trace a still\r\nfurther connection between the moon and the tides; he will observe that\r\nsome high tides rise higher than others, that some low tides fall lower\r\nthan others. This is a matter of much practical importance. When a\r\ndangerous bar has to be crossed, the sailor will feel much additional\r\nsecurity in knowing that he is carried over it on the top of a spring\r\ntide; or if he has to contend against tidal currents, which in some\r\nplaces have enormous force, he will naturally prefer for his voyage the\r\nneap tides, in which the strength of these currents is less than usual.\r\nThe spring tides and the neap tides will become familiar to him, and he\r\nwill perceive that the spring tides occur when the moon is full or\r\nnew--or, at all events, that the spring tides are within a certain\r\nconstant number of days of the full or new moon. It was, no doubt, by\r\nreasoning such as this, that in primitive times the connection between\r\nthe moon and the tides came to be perceived.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the great discovery of Newton had disclosed\r\nthe law of universal gravitation that it became possible to give a\r\nphysical explanation of the tides. It was then seen how the moon\r\nattracts the whole earth and every particle of the earth. It was seen\r\nhow the fluid particles which form the oceans on the earth were enabled\r\nto obey the attraction in a way that the solid parts could not. When the\r\nmoon is overhead it tends to draw the water up, as it were, into a heap\r\nunderneath, and thus to give rise to the high tide. The water on the\r\nopposite side of the earth is also affected in a way that might not be\r\nat first anticipated. The moon attracts the solid body of the earth with\r\ngreater intensity than it attracts the water at the other side which\r\nlies more distant from it. The earth is thus drawn away from the water,\r\nand there is therefore a tendency to a high tide as well on the side of\r\nthe earth away from the moon as on that towards the moon. The low tides\r\noccupy the intermediate positions.\r\n\r\nThe sun also excites tides on the earth; but owing to the great distance\r\nof the sun, the difference between its attraction on the sea and on the\r\nsolid interior of the earth is not so appreciable. The solar tides are\r\nthus smaller than the lunar tides. When the two conspire, they cause a\r\nspring tide; when the solar and lunar tides are opposed, we have the\r\nneap tide.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a multitude of circumstances to be taken into\r\naccount when we attempt to apply this general reasoning to the\r\nconditions of a particular case. Owing to local peculiarities the tides\r\nvary enormously at the different parts of the coast. In a confined area\r\nlike the Mediterranean Sea, the tides have only a comparatively small\r\nrange, varying at different places from one foot to a few feet. In\r\nmid-ocean also the tidal rise and fall is not large, amounting, for\r\ninstance, to a range of three feet at St. Helena. Near the great\r\ncontinental masses the tides become very much modified by the coasts. We\r\nfind at London a tide of eighteen or nineteen feet; but the most\r\nremarkable tides in the British Islands are those in the Bristol\r\nChannel, where, at Chepstow or Cardiff, there is a rise and fall during\r\nspring tides to the height of thirty-seven or thirty-eight feet, and at\r\nneap tides to a height of twenty-eight or twenty-nine. These tides are\r\nsurpassed in magnitude at other parts of the world. The greatest of all\r\ntides are those in the Bay of Fundy, at some parts of which the rise and\r\nfall at spring tides is not less than fifty feet.\r\n\r\nThe rising and falling of the tide is necessarily attended with the\r\nformation of currents. Such currents are, indeed, well known, and in\r\nsome of our great rivers they are of the utmost consequence. These\r\ncurrents of water can, like water-streams of any other kind, be made to\r\ndo useful work. We can, for instance, impound the rising water in a\r\nreservoir, and as the tide falls we can compel the enclosed water to\r\nwork a water-wheel before it returns to the sea. We have, indeed, here a\r\nsource of actual power; but it is only in very unusual circumstances\r\nthat it is found to be economical to use the tides for this purpose. The\r\nquestion can be submitted to calculation, and the area of the reservoir\r\ncan be computed which would retain sufficient water to work a\r\nwater-wheel of given horse-power. It can be shown that the area of the\r\nreservoir necessary to impound water enough to produce 100 horse-power\r\nwould be 40 acres. The whole question is then reduced to the simple one\r\nof expense: would the construction and the maintenance of this reservoir\r\nbe more or less costly than the erection and the maintenance of a\r\nsteam-engine of equivalent power? In most cases it would seem that the\r\nlatter would be by far the cheaper; at all events, we do not practically\r\nfind tidal engines in use, so that the power of the tides is now running\r\nto waste. The economical aspects of the case may, however, be very\r\nprofoundly altered at some remote epoch, when our stores of fuel, now\r\nso lavishly expended, give appreciable signs of approaching exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe tides are, however, _doing work_ of one kind or another. A tide in a\r\nriver estuary will sometimes scour away a bank and carry its materials\r\nelsewhere. We have here work done and energy consumed, just as much as\r\nif the same task had been accomplished by engineers directing the\r\npowerful arms of navvies. We know that work cannot be done without the\r\nconsumption of energy in some of its forms; whence, then, comes the\r\nenergy which supplies the power of the tides? At a first glance the\r\nanswer to this question seems a very obvious one. Have we not said that\r\nthe tides are caused by the moon? and must not the energy, therefore, be\r\nderived from the moon? This seems plain enough, but, unfortunately, it\r\nis not true. It is one of those cases by no means infrequent in\r\nDynamics, where the truth is widely different from that which seems to\r\nbe the case. An illustration will perhaps make the matter clearer. When\r\na rifle is fired, it is the finger of the rifleman that pulls the\r\ntrigger; but are we, then, to say that the energy by which the bullet\r\nhas been driven off has been supplied by the rifleman? Certainly not;\r\nthe energy is, of course, due to the gunpowder, and all the rifleman did\r\nwas to provide the means by which the energy stored up in the powder\r\ncould be liberated. To a certain extent we may compare this with the\r\ntidal problem; the tides raised by the moon are the originating cause\r\nwhereby a certain store of energy is drawn upon and applied to do such\r\nwork as the tides are competent to perform. This store of energy,\r\nstrange to say, does not lie in the moon; it is in the earth itself.\r\nIndeed, it is extremely remarkable that the moon actually gains energy\r\nfrom the tides by itself absorbing some of the store which exists in the\r\nearth. This is not put forward as an obvious result; it depends upon a\r\nrefined dynamical theorem.\r\n\r\nWe must clearly understand the nature of this mighty store of energy\r\nfrom which the tides draw their power, and on which the moon is\r\npermitted to make large and incessant drafts. Let us see in what sense\r\nthe earth is said to possess a store of energy. We know that the earth\r\nrotates on its axis once every day. It is this rotation which is the\r\nsource of the energy. Let us compare the rotation of the earth with the\r\nrotation of the fly-wheel belonging to a steam-engine. The rotation of\r\nthe fly-wheel is really a reservoir, into which the engine pours energy\r\nat each stroke of the piston. The various machines in the mill worked by\r\nthe engine merely draw upon the store of energy accumulated in the\r\nfly-wheel. The earth may be likened to a gigantic fly-wheel detached\r\nfrom the engine, though still connected with the machines in the mill.\r\nFrom its stupendous dimensions and from its rapid velocity, that great\r\nfly-wheel possesses an enormous store of energy, which must be expended\r\nbefore the fly-wheel comes to rest. Hence it is that, though the tides\r\nare caused by the moon, yet the energy they require is obtained by\r\nsimply appropriating some of the vast supply available from the rotation\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a distinction of a very fundamental character between\r\nthe earth and the fly-wheel of an engine. As the energy is withdrawn\r\nfrom the fly-wheel and consumed by the various machines in the mill, it\r\nis continually replaced by fresh energy, which flows in from the\r\nexertions of the steam-engine, and thus the velocity of the fly-wheel is\r\nmaintained. But the earth is a fly-wheel without the engine. When the\r\ntides draw upon the store of energy and expend it in doing work, that\r\nenergy is not replaced. The consequence is irresistible: the energy in\r\nthe rotation of the earth must be decreasing. This leads to a\r\nconsequence of the utmost significance. If the engine be cut off from\r\nthe fly-wheel, then, as everyone knows, the massive fly-wheel may still\r\ngive a few rotations, but it will speedily come to rest. A similar\r\ninference must be made with regard to the earth; but its store of energy\r\nis so enormous, in comparison with the demands which are made upon it,\r\nthat the earth is able to hold out. Ages of countless duration must\r\nelapse before the energy of the earth's rotation can be completely\r\nexhausted by such drafts as the tides are capable of making.\r\nNevertheless, it is necessarily true that the energy is decreasing; and\r\nif it be decreasing, then the speed of the earth's rotation must be\r\nsurely, if slowly, abating. Now we have arrived at a consequence of the\r\ntides which admits of being stated in the simplest language. If the\r\nspeed of rotation be abating, then the length of the day must be\r\nincreasing; and hence we are conducted to the following most important\r\nstatement: that the _tides are increasing the length of the day_.\r\n\r\nTo-day is longer than yesterday--to-morrow will be longer than to-day.\r\nThe difference is so small that even in the course of ages it can hardly\r\nbe said to have been distinctly established by observation. We do not\r\npretend to say how many centuries have elapsed since the day was even\r\none second shorter than it is at present; but centuries are not the\r\nunits which we employ in tidal evolution. A million years ago it is\r\nquite probable that the divergence of the length of the day from its\r\npresent value may have been very considerable. Let us take a glance back\r\ninto the profound depths of times past, and see what the tides have to\r\ntell us. If the present order of things has lasted, the day must have\r\nbeen shorter and shorter the farther we look back into the dim past. The\r\nday is now twenty-four hours; it was once twenty hours, once ten hours;\r\nit was once six hours. How much farther can we go? Once the six hours is\r\npast, we begin to approach a limit which must at some point bound our\r\nretrospect. The shorter the day the more is the earth bulged at the\r\nequator; the more the earth is bulged at the equator the greater is the\r\nstrain put upon the materials of the earth by the centrifugal force of\r\nits rotation. If the earth were to go too fast it would be unable to\r\ncohere together; it would separate into pieces, just as a grindstone\r\ndriven too rapidly is rent asunder with violence. Here, therefore, we\r\ndiscern in the remote past a barrier which stops the present argument.\r\nThere is a certain critical velocity which is the greatest that the\r\nearth could bear without risk of rupture, but the exact amount of that\r\nvelocity is a question not very easy to answer. It depends upon the\r\nnature of the materials of the earth; it depends upon the temperature;\r\nit depends upon the effect of pressure, and on other details not\r\naccurately known to us. An estimate of the critical velocity has,\r\nhowever, been made, and it has been shown mathematically that the\r\nshortest period of rotation which the earth could have, without flying\r\ninto pieces, is about three or four hours. The doctrine of tidal\r\nevolution has thus conducted us to the conclusion that, at some\r\ninconceivably remote epoch, the earth was spinning round its axis in a\r\nperiod approximating to three or four hours.\r\n\r\nWe thus learn that we are indebted to the moon for the gradual\r\nelongation of the day from its primitive value up to twenty-four hours.\r\nIn obedience to one of the most profound laws of nature, the earth has\r\nreacted on the moon, and the reaction of the earth has taken a tangible\r\nform. It has simply consisted in gradually driving the moon away from\r\nthe earth. You may observe that this driving away of the moon resembles\r\na piece of retaliation on the part of the earth. The consequence of the\r\nretreat of the moon is sufficiently remarkable. The path in which the\r\nmoon is revolving has at the present time a radius of 240,000 miles.\r\nThis radius must be constantly growing larger, in consequence of the\r\ntides. Provided with this fact, let us now glance back into the past\r\nhistory of the moon. As the moon's distance is increasing when we look\r\nforwards, so we find it decreasing when we look backwards. The moon must\r\nhave been nearer the earth yesterday than it is to-day; the difference\r\nis no doubt inappreciable in years, in centuries, or in thousands of\r\nyears; but when we come to millions of years, the moon must have been\r\nsignificantly closer than it is at present, until at length we find that\r\nits distance, instead of 240,000 miles, has dwindled down to 40,000, to\r\n20,000, to 10,000 miles. Nor need we stop--nor can we stop--until we\r\nfind the moon actually close to the earth's surface. If the present laws\r\nof nature have operated long enough, and if there has been no external\r\ninterference, then it cannot be doubted that the moon and the earth were\r\nonce in immediate proximity. We can, indeed, calculate the period in\r\nwhich the moon must have been revolving round the earth. The nearer the\r\nmoon is to the earth the quicker it must revolve; and at the critical\r\nepoch when the satellite was in immediate proximity to our earth it\r\nmust have completed each revolution in about three or four hours.\r\n\r\nThis has led to one of the most daring speculations which has ever been\r\nmade in astronomy. We cannot refrain from enunciating it; but it must be\r\nremembered that it is only a speculation, and to be received with\r\ncorresponding reserve. The speculation is intended to answer the\r\nquestion, What brought the moon into that position, close to the surface\r\nof the earth? We will only say that there is the gravest reason to\r\nbelieve that the moon was, at some very early period, fractured off from\r\nthe earth when the earth was in a soft or plastic condition.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the history we found the earth and the moon close\r\ntogether. We found that the rate of rotation of the earth was only a few\r\nhours, instead of twenty-four hours. We found that the moon completed\r\nits journey round the primitive earth in exactly the same time as the\r\nprimitive earth rotated on its axis, so that the two bodies were then\r\nconstantly face to face. Such a state of things formed what a\r\nmathematician would describe as a case of unstable dynamical\r\nequilibrium. It could not last. It may be compared to the case of a\r\nneedle balanced on its point; the needle must fall to one side or the\r\nother. In the same way, the moon could not continue to preserve this\r\nposition. There were two courses open: the moon must either have fallen\r\nback on the earth, and been reabsorbed into the mass of the earth, or it\r\nmust have commenced its outward journey. Which of these courses was the\r\nmoon to adopt? We have no means, perhaps, of knowing exactly what it was\r\nwhich determined the moon to one course rather than to another, but as\r\nto the course which was actually taken there can be no doubt. The fact\r\nthat the moon exists shows that it did not return to the earth, but\r\ncommenced its outward journey. As the moon recedes from the earth it\r\nmust, in conformity with Kepler's laws, require a longer time to\r\ncomplete its revolution. It has thus happened that, from the original\r\nperiod of only a few hours, the duration has increased until it has\r\nreached the present number of 656 hours. The rotation of the earth has,\r\nof course, also been modified, in accordance with the retreat of the\r\nmoon. Once the moon had commenced to recede, the earth was released from\r\nthe obligation which required it constantly to direct the same face to\r\nthe moon. When the moon had receded to a certain distance, the earth\r\nwould complete the rotation in less time than that required by the moon\r\nfor one revolution. Still the moon gets further and further away, and\r\nthe duration of the revolution increases to a corresponding extent,\r\nuntil three, four, or more days (or rotations of the earth) are\r\nidentical with the month (or revolution of the moon). Although the\r\nnumber of days in the month increases, yet we are not to suppose that\r\nthe rate of the earth's rotation is increasing; indeed, the contrary is\r\nthe fact. The earth's rotation is getting slower, and so is the\r\nrevolution of the moon, but the retardation of the moon is greater than\r\nthat of the earth. Even though the period of rotation of the earth has\r\ngreatly increased from its primitive value, yet the period of the moon\r\nhas increased still more, so that it is several times as large as that\r\nof the rotation of the earth. As ages roll on the moon recedes further\r\nand further, its orbit increases, the duration of the revolution\r\naugments, until at length a very noticeable epoch is attained, which is,\r\nin one sense, a culminating point in the career of the moon. At this\r\nepoch the revolution periods of the moon, when measured in rotation\r\nperiods of the earth, attain their greatest value. It would seem that\r\nthe month was then twenty-nine days. It is not, of course, meant that\r\nthe month and the day at that epoch were the month and the day as our\r\nclocks now measure time. Both were shorter then than now. But what we\r\nmean is, that at this epoch the earth rotated twenty-nine times on its\r\naxis while the moon completed one circuit.\r\n\r\nThis epoch has now been passed. No attempt can be made at present to\r\nevaluate the date of that epoch in our ordinary units of measurement. At\r\nthe same time, however, no doubt can be entertained as to the\r\nimmeasurable antiquity of the event, in comparison with all historic\r\nrecords; but whether it is to be reckoned in hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears, in millions of years, or in tens of millions of years, must be\r\nleft in great degree to conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable epoch once passed, we find that the course of events in\r\nthe earth-moon system begins to shape itself towards that remarkable\r\nfinal stage which has points of resemblance to the initial stage. The\r\nmoon still continues to revolve in an orbit with a diameter steadily,\r\nthough very slowly, growing. The length of the month is accordingly\r\nincreasing, and the rotation of the earth being still constantly\r\nretarded, the length of the day is also continually growing. But the\r\nratio of the length of the month to the length of the day now exhibits a\r\nchange. That ratio had gradually increased, from unity at the\r\ncommencement, up to the maximum value of somewhere about twenty-nine at\r\nthe epoch just referred to. The ratio now begins again to decline, until\r\nwe find the earth makes only twenty-eight rotations, instead of\r\ntwenty-nine, in one revolution of the moon. The decrease in the ratio\r\ncontinues until the number twenty-seven expresses the days in the month.\r\nHere, again, we have an epoch which it is impossible for us to pass\r\nwithout special comment. In all that has hitherto been said we have been\r\ndealing with events in the distant past; and we have at length arrived\r\nat the present state of the earth-moon system. The days at this epoch\r\nare our well-known days, the month is the well-known period of the\r\nrevolution of our moon. At the present time the month is about\r\ntwenty-seven of our days, and this relation has remained sensibly true\r\nfor thousands of years past. It will continue to remain sensibly true\r\nfor thousands of years to come, but it will not remain true\r\nindefinitely. It is merely a stage in this grand transformation; it may\r\npossess the attributes of permanence to our ephemeral view, just as the\r\nwings of a gnat seem at rest when illuminated by the electric spark; but\r\nwhen we contemplate the history with time conceptions sufficiently ample\r\nfor astronomy we realise how the present condition of the earth-moon\r\nsystem can have no greater permanence than any other stage in the\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nOur narrative must, however, now assume a different form. We have been\r\nspeaking of the past; we have been conducted to the present; can we say\r\nanything of the future? Here, again, the tides come to our assistance.\r\nIf we have rightly comprehended the truth of dynamics (and who is there\r\nnow that can doubt them?), we shall be enabled to make a forecast of the\r\nfurther changes of the earth-moon system. If there be no interruption\r\nfrom any external source at present unknown to us, we can predict--in\r\noutline, at all events--the subsequent career of the moon. We can see\r\nhow the moon will still follow its outward course. The path in which it\r\nrevolves will grow with extreme slowness, but yet it will always grow;\r\nthe progress will not be reversed, at all events, before the final stage\r\nof our history has been attained. We shall not now delay to dwell on the\r\nintervening stages; we will rather attempt to sketch the ultimate type\r\nto which our system tends. In the dim future--countless millions of\r\nyears to come--this final stage will be approached. The ratio of the\r\nmonth to the day, whose decline we have already referred to, will\r\ncontinue to decline. The period of revolution of the moon will grow\r\nlonger and longer, but the length of the day will increase much more\r\nrapidly than the increase in the duration of the moon's period. From the\r\nmonth of twenty-seven days we shall pass to a month of twenty-six days,\r\nand so on, until we shall reach a month of ten days, and, finally, a\r\nmonth of one day.\r\n\r\nLet us clearly understand what we mean by a month of one day. We mean\r\nthat the time in which the moon revolves around the earth will be equal\r\nto the time in which the earth rotates around its axis. The length of\r\nthis day will, of course, be vastly greater than our day. The only\r\nelement of uncertainty in these enquiries arises when we attempt to give\r\nnumerical accuracy to the statements. It seems to be as true as the laws\r\nof dynamics that a state of the earth-moon system in which the day and\r\nthe month are equal must be ultimately attained; but when we attempt to\r\nstate the length of that day we introduce a hazardous element into the\r\nenquiry. In giving any estimate of its length, it must be understood\r\nthat the magnitude is stated with great reserve. It may be erroneous to\r\nsome extent, though, perhaps, not to any considerable amount. The length\r\nof this great day would seem to be about equal to fifty-seven of our\r\ndays. In other words, at some critical time in the excessively distant\r\nfuture, the earth will take something like 1,400 hours to perform a\r\nrotation, while the moon will complete its journey precisely in the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe thus see how, in some respects, the first stage of the earth-moon\r\nsystem and the last stage resemble each other. In each case we have the\r\nday equal to the month. In the first case the day and the month were\r\nonly a small fraction of our day; in the last stage the day and the\r\nmonth are each a large multiple of our day. There is, however, a\r\nprofound contrast between the first critical epoch and the last. We have\r\nalready mentioned that the first epoch was one of unstability--it could\r\nnot last; but this second state is one of dynamical stability. Once that\r\nstate has been acquired, it would be permanent, and would endure for\r\never if the earth and the moon could be isolated from all external\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nThere is one special feature which characterises the movement when the\r\nmonth is equal to the day. A little reflection will show that when this\r\nis the case the earth must constantly direct the same face towards the\r\nmoon. If the day be equal to the month, then the earth and moon must\r\nrevolve together, as if bound by invisible bands; and whatever\r\nhemisphere of the earth be directed to the moon when this state of\r\nthings commences will remain there so long as the day remains equal to\r\nthe month.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is hardly possible to escape being reminded of that\r\ncharacteristic feature of the moon's motion which has been observed from\r\nall antiquity. We refer, of course, to the fact that the moon at the\r\npresent time constantly turns the same face to the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent upon astronomers to provide a physical explanation of\r\nthis remarkable fact. The moon revolves around our earth once in a\r\ndefinite number of seconds. If the moon always turns the same face to\r\nthe earth, then it is demonstrated that the moon rotates on its axis\r\nonce in the same number of seconds also. Now, this would be a\r\ncoincidence wildly improbable unless there were some physical cause to\r\naccount for it. We have not far to seek for a cause: the tides on the\r\nmoon have produced the phenomenon. We now find the moon has a rugged\r\nsurface, which testifies to the existence of intense volcanic activity\r\nin former times. Those volcanoes are now silent--the internal fires in\r\nthe moon seem to have become exhausted; but there was a time when the\r\nmoon must have been a heated and semi-molten mass. There was a time when\r\nthe materials of the moon were so hot as to be soft and yielding, and in\r\nthat soft and yielding mass the attraction of our earth excited great\r\ntides. We have no historical record of these tides (they were long\r\nanterior to the existence of telescopes, they were probably long\r\nanterior to the existence of the human race), but we know that these\r\ntides once existed by the work they have accomplished, and that work is\r\nseen to-day in the constant face which the moon turns towards the earth.\r\nThe gentle rise and fall of the oceans which form our tides present a\r\npicture widely different from the tides by which the moon was once\r\nagitated. The tides on the moon were vastly greater than those of the\r\nearth. They were greater because the weight of the earth is greater than\r\nthat of the moon, so that the earth was able to produce much more\r\npowerful tides in the moon than the moon has ever been able to raise on\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThat the moon should bend the same face to the earth depends immediately\r\nupon the condition that the moon shall rotate on its axis in precisely\r\nthe same period as that which it requires to revolve around the earth.\r\nThe tides are a regulating power of unremitting efficiency to ensure\r\nthat this condition shall be observed. If the moon rotated more slowly\r\nthan it ought, then the great lava tides would drag the moon round\r\nfaster and faster until it attained the desired velocity; and then, but\r\nnot till then, they would give the moon peace. Or if the moon were to\r\nrotate faster on its axis than in its orbit, again the tides would come\r\nfuriously into play; but this time they would be engaged in retarding\r\nthe moon's rotation, until they had reduced the speed of the moon to one\r\nrotation for each revolution.\r\n\r\nCan the moon ever escape from the thraldom of the tides? This is not\r\nvery easy to answer, but it seems perhaps not impossible that the moon\r\nmay, at some future time, be freed from tidal control. It is, indeed,\r\nobvious that the tides, even at present, have not the extremely\r\nstringent control over the moon which they once exercised. We now see no\r\nocean on the moon, nor do the volcanoes show any trace of molten lava.\r\nThere can hardly be tides _on_ the moon, but there may be tides _in_ the\r\nmoon. It may be that the interior of the moon is still hot enough to\r\nretain an appreciable degree of fluidity, and if so, the tidal control\r\nwould still retain the moon in its grip; but the time will probably\r\ncome, if it have not come already, when the moon will be cold to the\r\ncentre--cold as the temperature of space. If the materials of the moon\r\nwere what a mathematician would call absolutely rigid, there can be no\r\ndoubt that the tides could no longer exist, and the moon would be\r\nemancipated from tidal control. It seems impossible to predicate how far\r\nthe moon can ever conform to the circumstances of an actual rigid body,\r\nbut it may be conceivable that at some future time the tidal control\r\nshall have practically ceased. There would then be no longer any\r\nnecessary identity between the period of rotation and that of\r\nrevolution. A gleam of hope is thus projected over the astronomy of the\r\ndistant future. We know that the time of revolution of the moon is\r\nincreasing, and so long as the tidal governor could act, the time of\r\nrotation must increase sympathetically. We have now surmised a state of\r\nthings in which the control is absent. There will then be nothing to\r\nprevent the rotation remaining as at present, while the period of\r\nrevolution is increasing. The privilege of seeing the other side of the\r\nmoon, which has been withheld from all previous astronomers, may thus in\r\nthe distant future be granted to their successors.\r\n\r\nThe tides which the moon raises in the earth act as a brake on the\r\nrotation of the earth. They now constantly tend to bring the period of\r\nrotation of the earth to coincide with the period of revolution of the\r\nmoon. As the moon revolves once in twenty-seven days, the earth is at\r\npresent going too fast, and consequently the tidal control at the\r\npresent moment endeavours to retard the rotation of the earth. The\r\nrotation of the moon long since succumbed to tidal control, but that was\r\nbecause the moon was comparatively small and the tidal power of the\r\nearth was enormous. But this is the opposite case. The earth is large\r\nand more massive than the moon, the tides raised by the moon are but\r\nsmall and weak, and the earth has not yet completely succumbed to the\r\ntidal action. But the tides are constant, they never for an instant\r\nrelax the effort to control, and they are gradually tending to render\r\nthe day and the month coincident, though the progress is a very slow\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the tides leads us to look forward to a remote state of\r\nthings, in which the moon revolves around the earth in a period equal to\r\nthe day, so that the two bodies shall constantly bend the same face to\r\neach other, provided the tidal control be still able to guide the moon's\r\nrotation. So far as the mutual action of the earth and the moon is\r\nconcerned, such an arrangement possesses all the attributes of\r\npermanence. If, however, we venture to project our view to a still more\r\nremote future, we can discern an external cause which must prevent this\r\nmutual accommodation between the earth and the moon from being eternal.\r\nThe tides raised by the moon on the earth are so much greater than those\r\nraised by the sun, that we have, in the course of our previous\r\nreasoning, held little account of the sun-raised tides. This is\r\nobviously only an approximate method of dealing with the question. The\r\ninfluence of the solar tide is appreciable, and its importance\r\nrelatively to the lunar tide will gradually increase as the earth and\r\nmoon approach the final critical stage. The solar tides will have the\r\neffect of constantly applying a further brake to the rotation of the\r\nearth. It will therefore follow that, after the day and the month have\r\nbecome equal, a still further retardation awaits the length of the day.\r\nWe thus see that in the remote future we shall find the moon revolving\r\naround the earth in a shorter time than that in which the earth rotates\r\non its axis.\r\n\r\nA most instructive corroboration of these views is afforded by the\r\ndiscovery of the satellites of Mars. The planet Mars is one of the\r\nsmaller members of our system. It has a mass which is only the eighth\r\npart of the mass of the earth. A small planet like Mars has much less\r\nenergy of rotation to be destroyed than a larger one like the earth. It\r\nmay therefore be expected that the small planet will proceed much more\r\nrapidly in its evolution than the large one; we might, therefore,\r\nanticipate that Mars and his satellites have attained a more advanced\r\nstage of their history than is the case with the earth and her\r\nsatellite.\r\n\r\nWhen the discovery of the satellites of Mars startled the world, in\r\n1877, there was no feature which created so much amazement as the\r\nperiodic time of the interior satellite. We have already pointed out in\r\nChapter X. how Phobos revolves around Mars in a period of 7 hours 39\r\nminutes. The period of rotation of Mars himself is 24 hours 37 minutes,\r\nand hence we have the fact, unparalleled in the solar system, that the\r\nsatellite is actually revolving three times as rapidly as the planet is\r\nrotating. There can hardly be a doubt that the solar tides on Mars have\r\nabated its velocity of rotation in the manner just suggested.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me that the matter just referred to is one of\r\nthe most interesting and instructive in the whole history of astronomy.\r\nWe have, first, a very beautiful telescopic discovery of the minute\r\nsatellites of Mars, and we have a determination of the anomalous\r\nmovement of one of them. We have then found a satisfactory physical\r\nexplanation of the cause of this phenomenon, and we have shown it to be\r\na striking instance of tidal evolution. Finally, we have seen that the\r\nsystem of Mars and his satellite is really a forecast of the destiny\r\nwhich, after the lapse of ages, awaits the earth-moon system.\r\n\r\nIt seems natural to enquire how far the influence of tides can have\r\ncontributed towards moulding the planetary orbits. The circumstances are\r\nhere very different from those we have encountered in the earth-moon\r\nsystem. Let us first enunciate the problem in a definite shape. The\r\nsolar system consists of the sun in the centre, and of the planets\r\nrevolving around the sun. These planets rotate on their axes; and\r\ncirculating round some of the planets we have their systems of\r\nsatellites. For simplicity, we may suppose all the planets and their\r\nsatellites to revolve in the same plane, and the planets to rotate about\r\naxes which are perpendicular to that plane. In the study of the theory\r\nof tidal evolution we must be mainly guided by a profound dynamical\r\nprinciple known as the conservation of the \"moment of momentum.\" The\r\nproof of this great principle is not here attempted; suffice it to say\r\nthat it can be strictly deduced from the laws of motion, and is thus\r\nonly second in certainty to the fundamental truths of ordinary geometry\r\nor of algebra. Take, for instance, the giant planet, Jupiter. In one\r\nsecond he moves around the sun through a certain angle. If we multiply\r\nthe mass of Jupiter by that angle, and if we then multiply the product\r\nby the square of the distance from Jupiter to the sun, we obtain a\r\ncertain definite amount. A mathematician calls this quantity the\r\n\"orbital\" moment of momentum of Jupiter.[46] In the same way, if we\r\nmultiply the mass of Saturn by the angle through which the planet moves\r\nin one second, and this product by the square of the distance between\r\nthe planet and the sun, then we have the orbital moment of momentum of\r\nSaturn. In a similar manner we ascertain the moment of momentum for each\r\nof the other planets due to revolution around the sun. We have also to\r\ndefine the moment of momentum of the planets around their axes. In one\r\nsecond Jupiter rotates through a certain angle; we multiply that angle\r\nby the mass of Jupiter, and by the square of a certain line which\r\ndepends on his internal constitution: the product forms the \"rotational\"\r\nmoment of momentum. In a similar manner we find the rotational moment of\r\nmomentum for each of the other planets. Each satellite revolves through\r\na certain angle around its primary in one second; we obtain the moment\r\nof momentum of each satellite by multiplying its mass into the angle\r\ndescribed in one second, and then multiplying the product into the\r\nsquare of the distance of the satellite from its primary. Finally, we\r\ncompute the moment of momentum of the sun due to its rotation. This we\r\nobtain by multiplying the angle through which the sun turns in one\r\nsecond by the whole mass of the sun, and then multiplying the product by\r\nthe square of a certain line of prodigious length, which depends upon\r\nthe details of the sun's internal structure.\r\n\r\nIf we have succeeded in explaining what is meant by the moment of\r\nmomentum, then the statement of the great law is comparatively simple.\r\nWe are, in the first place, to observe that the moment of momentum of\r\nany planet may alter. It would alter if the distance of the planet from\r\nthe sun changed, or if the velocity with which the planet rotates upon\r\nits axis changed; so, too, the moment of momentum of the sun may change,\r\nand so may those of the satellites. In the beginning a certain total\r\nquantity of moment of momentum was communicated to our system, and not\r\none particle of that total can the solar system, as a whole, squander or\r\nalienate. No matter what be the mutual actions of the various bodies of\r\nthe system, no matter what perturbations they may undergo--what tides\r\nmay be produced, or even what mutual collisions may occur--the great law\r\nof the conservation of moment of momentum must be obeyed. If some bodies\r\nin the solar system be losing moment of momentum, then other bodies in\r\nthe system must be gaining, so that the total quantity shall remain\r\nunaltered. This consideration is one of supreme importance in connection\r\nwith the tides. The distribution of moment of momentum in the system is\r\nbeing continually altered by the tides; but, however the tides may ebb\r\nor flow, the total moment of momentum can never alter so long as\r\ninfluences external to the system are absent.\r\n\r\nWe must here point out the contrast between the endowment of our system\r\nwith energy and with moment of momentum. The mutual actions of our\r\nsystem, in so far as they produce heat, tend to squander the energy, a\r\nconsiderable part of which can be thus dissipated and lost; but the\r\nmutual actions have no power of dissipating the moment of momentum.\r\n\r\nThe total moment of momentum of the solar system being taken to be 100,\r\nthis is at present distributed as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Orbital moment of momentum of Jupiter  60\r\n  Orbital moment of momentum of Saturn   24\r\n  Orbital moment of momentum of Uranus    6\r\n  Orbital moment of momentum of Neptune   8\r\n  Rotational moment of momentum of Sun    2\r\n                                         --\r\n                                        100\r\n\r\nThe contributions of the other items are excessively minute. The orbital\r\nmoments of momentum of the few interior planets contain but little more\r\nthan one thousandth part of the total amount. The rotational\r\ncontributions of all the planets and of their satellites is very much\r\nless, being not more than one sixty-thousandth part of the whole. When,\r\ntherefore, we are studying the general effects of tides on the planetary\r\norbits these trifling matters may be overlooked. We shall, however, find\r\nit desirable to narrow the question still more, and concentrate our\r\nattention on one splendid illustration. Let us take the sun and the\r\nplanet Jupiter, and, supposing all other bodies of our system to be\r\nabsent, let us discuss the influence of tides produced in Jupiter by the\r\nsun, and of tides in the sun by Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIt might be hastily thought that, just as the moon was born of the\r\nearth, so the planets were born of the sun, and have gradually receded\r\nby tides into their present condition. We have the means of enquiry\r\ninto this question by the figures just given, and we shall show that it\r\nis impossible that Jupiter, or any of the other planets, can ever have\r\nbeen very much closer to the sun than they are at present. In the case\r\nof Jupiter and the sun we have the moment of momentum made up of three\r\nitems. By far the largest of these items is due to the orbital\r\nrevolution of Jupiter, the next is due to the sun, the third is due to\r\nthe rotation of Jupiter on its axis. We may put them in round numbers as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Orbital moment of momentum of Jupiter       600,000\r\n  Rotational moment of momentum of Sun         20,000\r\n  Rotational moment of momentum of Jupiter         12\r\n\r\nThe sun produces tides in Jupiter, those tides retard the rotation of\r\nJupiter. They make Jupiter rotate more and more slowly, therefore the\r\nmoment of momentum of Jupiter is decreasing, therefore its present value\r\nof 12 must be decreasing. Even the mighty sun himself may be distracted\r\nby tides. Jupiter raises tides in the sun, those tides retard the motion\r\nof the sun, and therefore the moment of momentum of the sun is\r\ndecreasing, and it follows from both causes that the item of 600,000\r\nmust be increasing; in other words, the orbital motion of Jupiter must\r\nbe increasing, or Jupiter must be receding from the sun. To this extent,\r\ntherefore, the sun-Jupiter system is analogous to the earth-moon system.\r\nAs the tides on the earth are driving away the moon, so the tides in\r\nJupiter and the sun are gradually driving the two bodies apart. But\r\nthere is a profound difference between the two cases. It can be proved\r\nthat the tides produced in Jupiter by the sun are more effective than\r\nthose produced in the sun by Jupiter. The contribution of the sun may,\r\ntherefore, be at present omitted; so that, practically, the\r\naugmentations of the orbital moment of momentum of Jupiter are now\r\nachieved at the expense of that stored up by Jupiter's rotation. But\r\nwhat is 12 compared with 600,000. Even when the whole of Jupiter's\r\nrotational moment of momentum and that of his satellites has become\r\nabsorbed into the orbital motion, there will hardly be an appreciable\r\ndifference in the latter. In ancient days we may indeed suppose that\r\nJupiter being hotter was larger than at present, and that he had\r\nconsiderably more rotational moment of momentum. But it is hardly\r\ncredible that Jupiter can ever have had one hundred times the moment of\r\nmomentum that he has at present. Yet even if 1,200 units of rotational\r\nmomentum had been transferred to the orbital motion it would only\r\ncorrespond with the most trivial difference in the distance of Jupiter\r\nfrom the sun. We are hence assured that the tides have not appreciably\r\naltered the dimensions of the orbit of Jupiter, or of the other great\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\nThe time will, however, come when the rotation of Jupiter on his axis\r\nwill be gradually abated by the influence of the tides. It will then be\r\nfound that the moment of momentum of the sun's rotation will be\r\ngradually expended in increasing the orbits of the planets, but as this\r\nreserve only holds about two per cent. of the whole amount in our system\r\nit cannot produce any considerable effect.\r\n\r\nThe theory of tidal evolution, which in the hands of Professor Darwin\r\nhas taught us so much with regard to the past history of the systems of\r\nsatellites in the solar system, will doubtless also, as pointed out by\r\nDr. See, be found to account for the highly eccentric orbits of double\r\nstar systems. In the earth-moon system we have two bodies exceedingly\r\ndifferent in bulk, the mass of the earth being about eighty times as\r\ngreat as that of the moon. But in the case of most double stars we have\r\nto do with two bodies not very different as regards mass. It can be\r\ndemonstrated that the orbit must have been originally of slight\r\neccentricity, but that tidal friction is capable not only of extending,\r\nbut also of elongating it. The accelerating force is vastly greater at\r\nperiastron (when the two bodies are nearest each other) than at apastron\r\n(when their distance is greatest). At periastron the disturbing force\r\nwill, therefore, increase the apastron distance by an enormous amount,\r\nwhile at apastron it increases the periastron distance by a very small\r\namount. Thus, while the ellipse is being gradually expanded, the orbit\r\ngrows more and more eccentric, until the axial rotations have been\r\nsufficiently reduced by the transfer of axial to orbital moment of\r\nmomentum.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must draw this chapter to a close, though there are many\r\nother subjects that might be included. The theory of tidal evolution is,\r\nindeed, one of quite exceptional interest. The earlier mathematicians\r\nexpended their labour on the determination of the dynamics of a system\r\nwhich consisted of rigid bodies. We are indebted to contemporary\r\nmathematicians for opening up celestial mechanics upon the more real\r\nsupposition that the bodies are not rigid; in other words, that they are\r\nsubject to tides. The mathematical difficulties are enormously enhanced,\r\nbut the problem is more true to nature, and has already led to some of\r\nthe most remarkable astronomical discoveries made in modern times.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nOur Story of the Heavens has now been told. We commenced this work with\r\nsome account of the mechanical and optical aids to astronomy; we have\r\nended it with a brief description of an intellectual method of research\r\nwhich reveals some of the celestial phenomena that occurred ages before\r\nthe human race existed. We have spoken of those objects which are\r\ncomparatively near to us, and then, step by step, we have advanced to\r\nthe distant nebulæ and clusters which seem to lie on the confines of the\r\nvisible universe. Yet how little can we see with even our greatest\r\ntelescopes, when compared with the whole extent of infinite space! No\r\nmatter how vast may be the depth which our instruments have sounded,\r\nthere is yet a beyond of infinite extent. Imagine a mighty globe\r\ndescribed in space, a globe of such stupendous dimensions that it shall\r\ninclude the sun and his system, all the stars and nebulæ, and even all\r\nthe objects which our finite capacities can imagine. Yet, what ratio\r\nmust the volume of this great globe bear to the whole extent of infinite\r\nspace? The ratio is infinitely less than that which the water in a\r\nsingle drop of dew bears to the water in the whole Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL QUANTITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN.\r\n\r\nThe sun's mean distance from the earth is 92,900,000 miles; his diameter\r\nis 866,000 miles; his mean density, as compared with water, is 1·4; his\r\nellipticity is insensible; he rotates on his axis in a period between 25\r\nand 26 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOON.\r\n\r\nThe moon's mean distance from the earth is 239,000 miles. The diameter\r\nof the moon is 2,160 miles; and her mean density, as compared with\r\nwater, is 3·5. The time of a revolution around the earth is 27·322 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n|       |Distance from the Sun in |          |  Mean  |          |Density |\r\n|       |  Millions of Miles.     | Periodic |Diameter|   Axial  |compared|\r\n|       |-------------------------|   Time   |   in   | Rotation.|  with  |\r\n|       | Mean. | Least.|Greatest.| in Days. | Miles. |          | Water. |\r\n|-------+-------+-------+---------+----------+--------+----------+--------|\r\n|Mercury|   36·0|   28·6|    43·3 |    87·969|  3,030 |   (?)    | 6·85(?)|\r\n|Venus  |   67·2|   66·6|    67·5 |   224·70 |  7,700 |   (?)    | 4·85   |\r\n|Earth  |   92·9|   91·1|    94·6 |   365·26 |  7,918 |23 56 4·09| 5·58   |\r\n|Mars   |  141  |  128  |   155   |   686·98 |  4,230 |24 37 22·7| 4·01   |\r\n|Jupiter|  483  |  459  |   505   | 4,332·6  | 86,500 | 9 55 --  | 1·38   |\r\n|Saturn |  886  |  834  |   936   |10,759    | 71,000 |10 14 --  | 0·72   |\r\n|Uranus |1,782  |1,700  | 1,860   |30,687    | 31,900 | Unknown  | 1·22   |\r\n|Neptune|2,792  |2,760  | 2,810   |60,127    | 34,800 | Unknown  | 1·11   |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SATELLITES OF MARS.\r\n\r\n          Mean Distance from   Periodic Time.\r\n  Name.

the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Popular Astronomy,\" p. 66.\r\n\r\n[3] _Limb_ is the word used by astronomers to denote the _edge_ or\r\ncircumference of the apparent disc of a heavenly body.\r\n\r\n[4] \"The Sun,\" p. 119.\r\n\r\n[5] It has been frequently stated that the outburst in 1859, witnessed\r\nby Carrington and Hodgson, was immediately followed by an unusually\r\nintense magnetic storm, but the records at Kew and Greenwich show that\r\nthe magnetic disturbances on that day were of a very trivial character.\r\n\r\n[6] Some ungainly critic has observed that the poet himself seems to\r\nhave felt a doubt on the matter, because he has supplemented the dubious\r\nmoonbeams by the \"lantern dimly burning.\" The more generous, if somewhat\r\na sanguine remark has been also made, that \"the time will come when the\r\nevidence of this poem will prevail over any astronomical calculations.\"\r\n\r\n[7] This sketch has been copied by permission from the very beautiful\r\nview in Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter's book, of which it forms Plate\r\nXI. So have also the other illustrations of lunar scenery in Plates\r\nVIII., IX. The photographs were obtained by Mr. Nasmyth from models\r\ncarefully constructed from his drawings to illustrate the features on\r\nthe moon. During the last twenty years photography has completely\r\nsuperseded drawing by eye in the delineation of lunar objects. Long\r\nseries of magnificent photographs of lunar scenery have been published\r\nby the Paris and Lick Observatories.\r\n\r\n[8] At the British Association's meeting at Cardiff in 1892, Prof.\r\nCopeland exhibited a model of the moon, on which the appearance of the\r\nstreaks near full moon was perfectly shown by means of small spheres of\r\ntransparent glass attached to the surface.\r\n\r\n[9] The duration of an occultation, or, in other words, the length of\r\ntime during which the moon hides the star, would be slightly shorter\r\nthan the computed time, if the moon had an atmosphere capable of\r\nsensibly refracting the light from the star. But, so far, our\r\nobservations do not indicate this with certainty.\r\n\r\n[10] I owe my knowledge of this subject to Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney,\r\nF.R.S. There has been some controversy as to who originated the\r\ningenious and instructive doctrine here sketched.\r\n\r\n[11] The space described by a falling body is proportional to the\r\nproduct of the force and the square of the time. The force varies\r\ninversely as the square of the distance from the earth, so that the\r\nspace will vary as the square of the time, and inversely as the square\r\nof the distance. If, therefore, the distance be increased sixty-fold,\r\nthe time must also be increased sixty-fold, if the space fallen through\r\nis to remain the same.\r\n\r\n[12] See Newcomb's \"Popular Astronomy,\" p. 78.\r\n\r\n[13] Recent investigation by Newcomb on the motion of Mercury have led\r\nto the result that the hypothesis of a planet or a ring of very small\r\nplanets between the orbit of Mercury and the sun cannot account for the\r\ndifference between theory and observation in the movements of Mercury.\r\nHarzer has come to the same result, and has shown that the disturbing\r\nelement may possibly be the material of the Solar Corona.\r\n\r\n[14] \"The Sun: its Planets, and their Satellites.\" London: 1882 (page\r\n147).\r\n\r\n[15] James Gregory, in a book on optics written in 1667, had already\r\nsuggested the use of the transit of Venus for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[16] _See_ \"Astronomy and Astrophysics,\" No. 128.\r\n\r\n[17] _See_ \"Astronomy and Astrophysics,\" No. 128.\r\n\r\n[18] This is the curved marking which on Plate XVIII. appears in\r\nlongitude 290° and north of (that is, below) the equator. Here, as in\r\nall astronomical drawings, north is at the foot and south at the top.\r\n_See_ above, p. 82 (Chapter III.).\r\n\r\n[19] Now Director of the Lick Observatory.\r\n\r\n[20] The heliometer is a telescope with its object-glass cut in half\r\nalong a diameter. One or both of these halves is movable transversely by\r\na screw. Each half gives a complete image of the object. The measures\r\nare effected by observing how many turns of the screw convey the image\r\nof the star formed by one half of the object-glass to coincide with the\r\nimage of the planet formed by the other.\r\n\r\n[21] See \"Astronomy and Astrophysics,\" No. 109.\r\n\r\n[22] It is only right to add that some observers believe that, in\r\nexceptional circumstances, points of Jupiter have shown some slight\r\ndegree of intrinsic light.\r\n\r\n[23] Professor Pickering, of Cambridge, Mass., has, however, effected\r\nthe important improvement of measuring the decline of light of the\r\nsatellite undergoing eclipse by the photometer. Much additional\r\nprecision may be anticipated in the results of such observations.\r\n\r\n[24] \"Newcomb's Popular Astronomy,\" p. 336.\r\n\r\n[25] _See_ Grant, \"History of Physical Astronomy,\" page 255.\r\n\r\n[26] Now Director of the Lick Observatory.\r\n\r\n[27] We are here neglecting the orbital motion of Saturn, by which the\r\nwhole system is moved towards or from the earth, but as this motion is\r\ncommon to the ball and the ring, it will not disturb the relative\r\npositions of the three spectra.\r\n\r\n[28] According to Prof. Barnard's recent measures, the diameter of Titan\r\nis 2,700 miles. This is the satellite discovered by Huyghens; it is the\r\nsixth in order from the planet.\r\n\r\n[29] Extract from \"Three Cities of Russia,\" by C. Piazzi Smyth, vol.\r\nii., p. 164: \"In the year 1796. It then chanced that George III., of\r\nGreat Britain, was pleased to send as a present to the Empress Catharine\r\nof Russia a ten-foot reflecting telescope constructed by Sir William\r\nHerschel. Her Majesty immediately desired to try its powers, and\r\nRoumovsky was sent for from the Academy to repair to Tsarskoe-Selo,\r\nwhere the Court was at the time residing. The telescope was accordingly\r\nunpacked, and for eight long consecutive evenings the Empress employed\r\nherself ardently in observing the moon, planets, and stars; and more\r\nthan this, in inquiring into the state of astronomy in her dominions.\r\nThen it was that Roumovsky set before the Imperial view the Academy's\r\nidea of removing their observatory, detailing the necessity for, and the\r\nadvantages of, such a proceeding. Graciously did the 'Semiramis of the\r\nNorth,' the 'Polar Star,' enter into all these particulars, and warmly\r\napprove of the project; but death closed her career within a few weeks\r\nafter, and prevented her execution of the design.\"\r\n\r\n[30] _See_ Professor Holden's \"Sir William Herschel, his Life and\r\nWorks.\"\r\n\r\n[31] Arago says that \"Lemonnier's records were the image of chaos.\"\r\nBouvard showed to Arago one of the observations of Uranus which was\r\nwritten on a paper bag that in its time had contained hair-powder.\r\n\r\n[32] The first comet of 1884 also suddenly increased in brightness,\r\nwhile a distinct disc, which hitherto had formed the nucleus, became\r\ntransformed into a fine point of light.\r\n\r\n[33] The three numbers 12, 1, and 1/4 are nearly inversely proportional\r\nto the atomic weights of hydrogen, hydrocarbon gas, and iron vapour, and\r\nit is for this reason that Bredichin suggested the above-mentioned\r\ncomposition of the various types of tail. Spectroscopic evidence of the\r\npresence of hydrogen is yet wanting.\r\n\r\n[34] This illustration, as well as the figure of the path of the\r\nmeteors, has been derived from Dr. G.J. Stoney's interesting lecture on\r\n\"The Story of the November Meteors,\" at the Royal Institution, in 1879.\r\n\r\n[35] On the 27th November, 1885, a piece of meteoric iron fell at\r\nMazapil, in Mexico, during the shower of Andromedes, but whether it\r\nformed part of the swarm is not known. It is, however, to be noticed\r\nthat meteorites are said to have fallen on several other occasions at\r\nthe end of November.\r\n\r\n[36] Hooke had noticed, in 1664, that the star Gamma Arietis was double.\r\n\r\n[37] Perhaps if we could view the stars without the intervention of the\r\natmosphere, blue stars would be more common. The absorption of the\r\natmosphere specially affects the greenish and bluish colours. Professor\r\nLangley gives us good reason for believing that the sun itself would be\r\nblue if it were not for the effect of the air.\r\n\r\n[38] The declination of a star is the arc drawn from the star to the\r\nequator at right angles to the latter.\r\n\r\n[39] The distance of 61 Cygni has, however, again been investigated by\r\nProfessor Asaph Hall, of Washington, who has obtained a result\r\nconsiderably less than had been previously supposed; on the other hand,\r\nProfessor Pritchard's photographic researches are in confirmation of\r\nStruve's and those obtained at Dunsink.\r\n\r\n[40] I am indebted for this drawing to the kindness of Messrs. De la\r\nRue.\r\n\r\n[41] _See_ Chapter XIX., on the mass of Sirius and his satellite.\r\n\r\n[42] As the earth carries on the telescope at the rate of 18 miles a\r\nsecond, and as light moves with the velocity of 180,000 miles a second\r\nvery nearly, it follows that the velocity of the telescope is about one\r\nten-thousandth part of that of light. While the light moves down the\r\ntube 20 feet long, the telescope will therefore have moved the\r\nten-thousandth part of 20 feet--_i.e._, the fortieth of an inch.\r\n\r\n[43] _See_ Newcomb's \"Popular Astronomy,\" p. 508, where the discovery of\r\nthis law is attributed to Mr. J. Homer Lane, of Washington. The\r\ncontraction theory is due to Helmholtz.\r\n\r\n[44] The theory of Tidal Evolution sketched in this chapter is mainly\r\ndue to the researches of Professor G.H. Darwin, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n[45] The hour varies with the locality: it would be 11.49 at Calais; at\r\nLiverpool, 11.23; at Swansea Bay, 5.56, etc.\r\n\r\n[46] Having decided upon the units of mass, of angle, and of distance\r\nwhich we intend to use for measuring these quantities, then any mass, or\r\nangle, or distance is expressed by a certain definite number. Thus if we\r\ntake the mass of the earth as the unit of mass, the angle through which\r\nit moves in a second as the unit of angle, and its distance from the sun\r\nas the unit of distance, we shall find that the similar quantities for\r\nJupiter are expressed by the numbers 316, 0·0843, and 5·2 respectively.\r\nHence its orbital moment of momentum is 316 × 0·0843 × (5·2)².\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Story of the Heavens, by Robert Stawell Ball",
