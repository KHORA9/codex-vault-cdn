Some parts\r\nof the country, because of their accessibility, soon became relatively\r\nwell known; other regions lying off the beaten path were bypassed or\r\ninadequately sampled. Principally in the last decade herpetologists have\r\nbeen entering regions from which no collections previously were\r\navailable in an attempt to fill gaps in known distributions and to\r\ndiscover unknown species of animals. In 1950 Dr. Donald D. Brand led an\r\nexploration party from the University of Texas to the poorly explored\r\nand faunistically unknown region of southwestern Michoacan. James A.\r\nPeters accompanied Brand and collected amphibians and reptiles. In 1951\r\nI welcomed the opportunity to accompany Brand on a second expedition to\r\nsouthwestern Michoacan. Such was the beginning of my interest in the\r\nherpetofauna of the region. I have been fortunate to return to Michoacan\r\non four successive trips, all of which had as their purpose the\r\naccumulation of data on the herpetofauna that would result in a survey\r\nof the component species and an analysis of their distribution.\r\n\r\nMy original intention was to amplify Peters' (1954) study based on the\r\ncollections made by him in 1950 and by me in 1951 in the Sierra de\r\nCoalcoman. But it soon became evident that in order to understand the\r\nrelationships of the herpetofauna of the Sierra de Coalcoman, the\r\nspecies inhabiting the Tepalcatepec Valley and adjacent mountain ranges\r\nwould have to be studied. In the course of making that study I examined\r\nall specimens from Michoacan already in museums.\r\n\r\nThere have been few detailed herpetofaunal studies in Mexico. The first\r\nsuch study of any consequence was that by Bogert and Oliver (1945) on\r\nthe herpetofauna of Sonora. In that paper the authors analyzed the fauna\r\nfrom a geographic view and showed the transition from tropical species\r\nin the southern part of the state to members of the Sonoran Desert\r\nassemblage to the north. Martin (1958) made a detailed study of the\r\nherpetofauna of the Gomez Farias region in southern Tamaulipas; he\r\nemphasized the ecological distribution of amphibians and reptiles in\r\nthat region with special reference to cloud forests. Duellman (1958c)\r\npresented a preliminary geographic analysis of the herpetofauna of\r\nColima with special reference to the continuity of the species\r\ninhabiting the lowlands. Zweifel (1960) discussed in detail the\r\nherpetofauna of the Tres Marias Islands and commented on the derivation\r\nof the fauna. Duellman (1960d) provided a detailed account of the\r\ngeographic distribution of the amphibians known to occur in the lowlands\r\nof the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and attempted to account for the present\r\npatterns of distribution.\r\n\r\nThe present report is the first of two parts dealing with the\r\nherpetofauna of Michoacan. The purpose of this part is to present a full\r\naccount of the species of amphibians and reptiles known to inhabit the\r\nstate of Michoacan; the accounts of the species are accompanied by a\r\nbrief description of the natural landscape and of the various\r\nassemblages of species comprising the major faunistic groups within the\r\nregion. A gazetteer of collecting localities is appended. The second\r\npart of the study, now in preparation, deals with the ecological and\r\nhistorical geography of the herpetofauna. Since the present part will be\r\nof interest primarily to systematic herpetologists, I have decided to\r\nseparate it from the more general material of interest to\r\nbiogeographers.\r\n\r\nOne of the major problems that faces the worker undertaking a faunal\r\nstudy is the presence of species or genera of unsettled systematic\r\nstatus. My work in Michoacan has been no exception; fifteen separate\r\nstudies were undertaken in an attempt to solve systematic problems in\r\ncertain groups. Some systematic problems still remain but are of little\r\nconsequence insofar as the entire faunal picture is concerned, or are so\r\ninvolved as to be impractical to undertake at this time. In accounts of\r\nspecies, such problems are mentioned in the hope that they will interest\r\nsome worker who will be inclined to investigate them.\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in the study of the herpetofauna of Michoacan I have built\r\nup a debt of gratitude to many individuals, without whose aid my\r\nambition to complete my study never would have been realized. I am\r\nespecially grateful to those individuals who accompanied me in the\r\nfield; Lee D. Beatty, Richard E. Etheridge, Carter R. Gilbert, Fred G.\r\nThompson, Jerome Tulecke, and John Wellman offered stimulating\r\ncompanionship and valuable assistance. On many occasions they suffered\r\nhardships on behalf of my interests.\r\n\r\nStudies of my own specimens have been augmented by material from other\r\ninstitutions. For permitting me to examine specimens in their care I am\r\nindebted to W. Frank Blair, Charles M. Bogert, Doris M. Cochran, William\r\nB. Davis, James R. Dixon, the late Emmett R. Dunn, Josef Eiselt, Alice\r\nG. C. Grandison, Norman Hartweg, Robert F. Inger, Arthur Loveridge, the\r\nlate Karl P. Schmidt, Hobart M. Smith, Robert C. Stebbins, Margaret\r\nStorey, Edward H. Taylor, and Richard G. Zweifel.\r\n\r\nSeveral people have aided me in the study of specimens and in the\r\nanalysis of data; I am grateful to Donald D. Brand, who first introduced\r\nme to Michoacan; since that time I have benefited much from his\r\nknowledge of the area. James A. Peters provided me with essential\r\ninformation concerning his field work in southern Michoacan in 1950.\r\nJames R. Dixon and Floyd L. Downs have permitted me to use freely the\r\nmaterial and data that they accumulated in their recent field work in\r\nMichoacan. Norman E. Hartweg allowed me to use the specimens and data\r\nthat he gathered in his survey of the herpetofauna in the region of\r\nVolcan Paricutin. L. C. Stuart, Charles F. Walker, and Richard G.\r\nZweifel have helped in unraveling some of the systematic and\r\ndistributional problems.\r\n\r\nI am especially grateful to my wife, Ann, who for six months helped me\r\ntrack down elusive species and explore new areas. Furthermore, she has\r\nstimulated me to carry this study to completion.\r\n\r\nMany people in Michoacan favored the field parties with quarters,\r\ntransportation, and valuable information, which greatly facilitated the\r\nfield work. In this respect I am especially indebted to Ingeniero Ruben\r\nErbina of Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, who not only let us use his home\r\nas our headquarters, but through a letter of introduction gave us the\r\n\"key\" to southern Michoacan. Ingeniero Pedro Tonda aided us in Arteaga\r\nand San Salvador. Ingeniero Anastacio Perez Alfaro of the Comision\r\nTepalcatepec in Uruapan provided the latest maps of southern Michoacan\r\nand much essential information pertaining to travel conditions in the\r\narea. Senor Nefty Mendoza gave us a home in Dos Aguas; this kindness\r\nallowed us to work in this interesting region during the height of the\r\nrainy season. Mr. and Mrs. Bob Thomas let us make use of their\r\nfacilities at Hacienda Zirimicuaro. The naval officers at the Estacion\r\nMarina at Playa Azul made pleasant what might have been a dreadful stay\r\nin that small coastal village. To the managers and pilots of Lineas\r\nAereas Picho in Uruapan I owe special thanks for going out of their way\r\non more than one occasion to transport a stranded snake-hunter.\r\nThroughout the months of field work beginning in 1955 I constantly have\r\nbeen aided by the authorities and workers of the Comision Tepalcatepec,\r\na subdivision of the Secretaria de Caminos y Obras Publicas, and of the\r\nprivate corporation, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados. Much of the field\r\nwork in Michoacan was made possible only through the co-operation of the\r\nnatives who supplied mules, acted as guides, and aided in the collection\r\nof specimens. I have learned a great deal from these people. They will\r\nnever see this report. Their work as guides, muleteers, and collectors\r\ngreatly assisted me with the mountains of equipment that had to be piled\r\non the backs of scrawny mules for transportation to places where the\r\nnatives seldom trod. Their efforts in behalf of Don Guillermo never will\r\nbe forgotten; I extend an especially hearty _muchas gracias_ to\r\nBenjamin, Ignacio, Jesus, Lorenzo, Mariano, and Remigio.\r\n\r\nMuch of the work on this report was done while I was associated with the\r\nMuseum of Zoology at the University of Michigan. I thank Norman E.\r\nHartweg and T. H. Hubbell for making available to me the facilities of\r\nthe museum and for their numerous courtesies that aided me so much.\r\n\r\nMy field work in Michoacan was supported by the Museum of Zoology at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan (1951), by the Horace H. Rackham School of\r\nGraduate Studies of the University of Michigan (1955), by the Penrose\r\nFund of the American Philosophical Society (1956), by the Bache Fund of\r\nthe National Academy of Sciences (1958), and by the University of Kansas\r\nEndowment Association (1960).\r\n\r\nPermits for collecting specimens in Mexico were provided by the\r\nDireccion General de Caza through the courtesy of Ing. Juan Lozano\r\nFranco and Luis Macias Arellano.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Account\r\n\r\nUnlike many parts of southern Mexico and northern Central America,\r\nMichoacan received no attention from the collecting expeditions of the\r\nEuropean museums in the last century. The earliest known herpetological\r\nspecimens from Michoacan were obtained by Louis John Xantus, who was\r\nappointed U. S. Consul to Colima in 1859. In April, 1863, Xantus\r\ncollected at Volcan Jorullo in Michoacan; in April and May of the same\r\nyear he collected along the coast of Michoacan between the Rio Cachan\r\nand the Rio Nexpa. His small collection of 19 extant specimens is in the\r\nUnited States National Museum. Alfredo Duges, a resident of Guanajuato,\r\nMexico, made early contributions to the knowledge of the herpetofauna of\r\nMichoacan. In 1885 he described _Sonora michoacanensis_, and in 1891 he\r\ndescribed _Eumeces altamirani_; from what is known of the distribution\r\nof these species, he probably had collected in the Tepalcatepec Valley.\r\nDuring their biological survey of Mexico, Edward W. Nelson and Edward A.\r\nGoldman spent a limited amount of time in Michoacan in 1892 and again in\r\n1903 and 1904. Most of their collecting was done on the plateau in the\r\nnorth-central part of the state; their collections are in the United\r\nStates National Museum. While collecting fishes in southern Mexico, Seth\r\nE. Meek obtained some amphibians and reptiles from Lago de Patzcuaro in\r\n1904; these are in the collections of the Chicago Natural History\r\nMuseum. In 1908 Hans Gadow ventured into the then unexplored \"tierra\r\ncaliente\" of the Balsas Valley and collected at Volcan Jorullo and other\r\nlocalities in the valley. Later in the same year he collected at\r\nGuayabo, San Salvador, and Arteaga in the Sierra de Coalcoman and at\r\nBuena Vista and Cofradia in the Tepalcatepec Valley. His collections\r\nwere deposited in the British Museum (Natural History) and the\r\nNaturhistorisches Museum Wien.\r\n\r\nThe first thirty years of the present century saw little more field work\r\nin Michoacan. In the 1930's Edward H. Taylor and Hobart M. Smith\r\ncollected throughout much of Mexico. At various times they worked in\r\nMichoacan, principally along the road from Mexico City to Guadalajara.\r\nIn 1935 Hobart M. Smith spent a week at Hacienda El Sabino south of\r\nUruapan; he revisited the locality again in 1936 and made a large and\r\nimportant collection of amphibians and reptiles from the upper limits of\r\nthe arid tropical scrub forest in the Tepalcatepec Valley. Specimens\r\ncollected by Smith and Taylor were incorporated into the Edward H.\r\nTaylor-Hobart M. Smith collection, which subsequently was deposited in\r\npart in the Museum of Natural History at the University of Illinois and\r\nin part in the Chicago Natural History Museum. In 1939 Hobart M. Smith\r\ncollected at Patzcuaro and between Uruapan and Apatzingan; these\r\ncollections, made while he was a Walter Rathbone Bacon Scholar of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, are deposited in the United States National\r\nMuseum. In 1940 and 1941 Frederick A. Shannon, who was a member of the\r\nHoogstraal Expeditions under the auspices of the Chicago Natural History\r\nMuseum, collected on Cerro de Tancitaro and at Apatzingan; an account of\r\nthe specimens collected there was published by Schmidt and Shannon\r\n(1947).\r\n\r\nThe eruption of Volcan Paricutin in February, 1943, attracted the\r\nattention of many biologists, a group of which from the Museum of\r\nZoology at the University of Michigan collected in the Cordillera\r\nVolcanica in 1945 and 1947. The amphibians and reptiles were collected\r\nand studied by Norman E. Hartweg. In 1950 James A. Peters accompanied\r\nDonald D. Brand on a preliminary exploration of the western part of the\r\nSierra de Coalcoman and adjacent Pacific coast of Michoacan; in the same\r\nyear Peters collected also on the Mexican Plateau and at Volcan Jorullo.\r\nHis specimens are in the Museum of Zoology at the University of\r\nMichigan. Since 1950 many biologists have collected in Michoacan in the\r\ncourse of work on certain groups of animals or in general surveys. In\r\nthis way Raymond Alcorn, Robert W. Dickerman, James R. Dixon, Floyd L.\r\nDowns, Emmet T. Hooper, and Robert R. Miller have contributed to our\r\nknowledge of the herpetofauna.\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, my own field work in Michoacan began in 1951, when\r\nI accompanied Donald D. Brand on an exploring expedition to the\r\nsouthern part of the state. In that year a short time was spent on the\r\nMexican Plateau, principally in the area around Lago de Cuitzeo, and at\r\nVolcan Jorullo. In July and August we made our headquarters at\r\nCoalcoman. From that town the field party travelled southward to Maruata\r\non the Pacific coast and thence back over the mountains to Coalcoman.\r\nLater in that summer we travelled by mule from Coalcoman southeastward\r\nto the mouth of the Rio Nexpa. In 1955, accompanied by Lee D. Beatty,\r\nCarter R. Gilbert, and Fred G. Thompson, I collected in the Tepalcatepec\r\nValley and at Coalcoman. We made a mule trip from Coalcoman to Cerro de\r\nBarolosa, where we made the first collections from the pine-fir forests\r\nin the Sierra de Coalcoman. Later in the same summer Carter R. Gilbert\r\nand I spent a week at Playa Azul on the Pacific coast. In March, April,\r\nand May, 1956, my wife and I collected for a short time in the\r\nCordillera Volcanica and on the Mexican Plateau. In early April we moved\r\ninto the Tepalcatepec Valley, where we collected intensively between\r\nChurumuco and Tepalcatepec. In May we collected on the Pacific coast\r\nbetween Boca de Apiza and La Placita. In July and August, 1956,\r\naccompanied by Richard E. Etheridge, we returned to Michoacan and again\r\ncollected on the Mexican Plateau and in the Cordillera Volcanica, before\r\nmoving into the Tepalcatepec Valley. In an attempt to fill in gaps in\r\nthe known distributions of many species and to sample the fauna in some\r\npreviously uncollected areas, I returned to Michoacan in June, 1958.\r\nAccompanied by Jerome B. Tulecke and John Wellman, I collected on the\r\nMexican Plateau in the northwestern part of the state, on the southern\r\nslopes of the Cordillera Volcanica, and in the Tepalcatepec Valley. Most\r\nof our time was spent in the Sierra de Coalcoman, where we collected at\r\nAguililla, Artega, and Dos Aguas. In 1960 two days were spent in\r\nMichoacan; a small collection was made in the eastern part of the\r\nCordillera Volcanica. With the exception of the specimens collected in\r\n1960, which are at the Museum of Natural History at the University of\r\nKansas, the specimens that I have collected in Michoacan are in the\r\nMuseum of Zoology at the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL LANDSCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nA proper understanding of the geographical distribution of animals in a\r\ngiven region is possible only after a thorough acquaintance with the\r\ngeography of the region. Likewise, in order to gain a knowledge of the\r\necological distribution and relationships of the components of the\r\nfauna, it is necessary to study the animals in their natural\r\nenvironments. In order to give the reader a picture of the physical\r\nfeatures and the major animal habitats within the state of Michoacan,\r\nthe following brief description is offered. Each of these facets\r\nmentioned below will be elaborated in detail in my final report on the\r\nherpetofauna of Michoacan.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysiography\r\n\r\nThe state of Michoacan comprises an area of 60,093 square kilometers\r\n(Vivo, 1953). Within this area the rugged terrain has a total relief of\r\nnearly 4000 meters. There have been several attempts to classify the\r\nphysiographic provinces of Mexico; the classification used here is a\r\nslight modification of the scheme proposed by Tamayo (1949). I have\r\ntried to keep the system as simple as possible, but still useful in\r\ndiscussing the distribution of animals living in the region. For general\r\npurposes the state of Michoacan can be divided into lowlands and\r\nhighlands as follows:\r\n\r\n    LOWLANDS\r\n      Pacific Coastal Plain\r\n      Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin\r\n\r\n    HIGHLANDS\r\n      Mexican Plateau\r\n      Cordillera Volcanica\r\n      Sierra de Coalcoman\r\n\r\nAlthough the lowlands in the state are continuous, they are only\r\nnarrowly connected and thus form two distinct physiographic and biotic\r\nareas. The Pacific Coastal Plain in Michoacan extends for a distance of\r\nabout 200 kilometers (airline) from the Rio Coahuayana to the Rio\r\nBalsas. The coastal plain is broad between the Rio Coahuayana and San\r\nJuan de Lima, and between Las Penas and the Rio Balsas, where the hills\r\nrise some 12 kilometers inland from the sea. Between San Juan de Lima\r\nand Las Penas the mountains extend to the sea; in this region rocky\r\npromontories form precipitous cliffs dropping into the sea. Between the\r\npromontories are small sandy or rocky beaches.\r\n\r\nLying to the north of the Sierra de Coalcoman and the Sierra del Sur,\r\nbut south of the Cordillera Volcanica, is a broad structural depression,\r\nthe Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin. The western part of this basin, which\r\nseparates the Sierra de Coalcoman from the Cordillera Volcanica, is the\r\nvalley of the Rio Tepalcatepec, a major tributary of the Rio Balsas. The\r\neastern part of the basin is the valley of the Rio Balsas. From the\r\npoint of junction of the two rivers, the Rio Balsas flows southward\r\nthrough a narrow gorge, which separates the Sierra de Coalcoman from\r\nthe Sierra del Sur, to the Pacific Ocean. In Michoacan the floor of the\r\nBalsas-Tepalcatepec Basin varies from 200 to 700 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nThe central part of Mexico is a vast table-land, the Mexican Plateau,\r\nthe southern part of which extends into northern Michoacan. In this\r\nregion the terrain is rolling and varies from 1500 to 1900 meters above\r\nsea level. Many small mountain ranges rise from the plateau and break\r\nthe continuity of the rolling table-land. Located on the southern part\r\nof the Mexican Plateau in Michoacan are several lakes, the largest of\r\nwhich are Lago de Chapala, Lago de Cuitzeo, and Lago de Patzcuaro.\r\n\r\nBordering the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau is a nearly unbroken\r\nchain of volcanos, the Cordillera Volcanica. The highest peaks in\r\nMichoacan, Cerro San Andres (3930 meters) and Cerro de Tancitaro (3870\r\nmeters), are in this range. Parts of the Cordillera Volcanica in\r\nMichoacan are known by separate names; these are, from west to east:\r\nSierra de los Tarascos, Sierra de Ozumatlan, and Serrania de Ucareo.\r\n\r\nLying between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the Pacific Ocean, and east of\r\nthe Rio Coahuayana and west of the Rio Balsas, is an isolated highland\r\nmass, the Sierra de Coalcoman. This mountain range rises to elevations\r\nof slightly more than 3000 meters. It has a length of about 200\r\nkilometers and a width of about 80 kilometers. Except for a relatively\r\nlow connection with the Cordillera Volcanica, the Sierra de Coalcoman is\r\nisolated from other mountain ranges in southwestern Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\nThe climates in Michoacan vary from tropical in the lowlands to cool\r\ntemperate at high elevations in the Sierra de Coalcoman and Cordillera\r\nVolcanica. The highest temperatures are known in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec\r\nBasin, where at Churumuco the mean annual temperature is 29.3 deg. C. and\r\nthe range of monthly means is 3.5 deg. C. (Contreras, 1942). Frosts occur\r\nsporadically on the Mexican Plateau, and in the winter snow falls on the\r\nhighest mountains.\r\n\r\nPrecipitation varies geographically and seasonally. Most of the rain\r\nfalls between June and October. In the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin\r\nrainfall in the rest of the year is negligible. The annual average\r\nrainfall at Coahuayana on the Pacific Coastal Plain is 871 mm.\r\n(Guzman-Rivas, 1957:52). In the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin rainfall\r\nseldom exceeds 800 mm. per year. In the mountains precipitation is\r\nheavier and somewhat more evenly distributed throughout the year, but\r\nstill definitely cyclic. For example, Uruapan (elevation, 1500 meters)\r\nreceives an average annual rainfall of 1674 mm. (Contreras, 1942). The\r\nprevailing winds are from the Pacific Ocean. The southern (windward)\r\nslopes of the Sierra de Coalcoman probably receive more rain than any\r\nother part of the state. The Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin lies in a rain\r\nshadow of the Sierra de Coalcoman, and the Mexican Plateau lies in a\r\nsomewhat less drastic rain shadow of the Cordillera Volcanica; these are\r\nthe driest regions in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETATION AND ANIMAL HABITATS\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this report I have adopted the classification of\r\ntypes of vegetation that seem to me most significant in terms of\r\necological distribution of reptiles and amphibians in Michoacan. These\r\ntypes are as follows:\r\n\r\n    TEMPERATE (1000-4000 meters)\r\n      Fir Forest (2400-4000 meters)\r\n      Pine-oak Forest (1000-4000 meters)\r\n      Mesquite-grassland (1500-2100 meters)\r\n\r\n    TROPICAL (0-1000 meters)\r\n      Arid Tropical Scrub Forest (0-1000 meters)\r\n      Tropical Semi-deciduous Forest (150-600 meters)\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the Pacific Coastal Plain and the Balsas-Tepalcatepec\r\nBasin consists of arid tropical scrub forest, composed of deciduous\r\ntrees, which in many places are stunted and widely spaced. In the dry\r\nseason there is little cover provided by this forest. In the rainy\r\nseason there is a sparse growth of grasses and some shade provided by\r\nthe small leaves of the thorny trees.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan the rainfall is heaviest on the southern slopes of the\r\nSierra de Coalcoman and somewhat less so on the southwestern slopes of\r\nthe Cordillera Volcanica. At these relatively low elevations (150 to 600\r\nmeters) there is tropical semi-deciduous forest, characterized by\r\nrelatively dense shade throughout the year and by a leaf mulch on the\r\nground. This type of forest forms the gallery forest along the larger\r\nstreams in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin and on the Pacific Coastal\r\nPlain.\r\n\r\nRainfall also is heavy on the high mountain ridges, where temperatures\r\nare low. On these ridges, fir forest, often mixed with pine and oaks, is\r\nfound. This habitat is characterized by a cool, moist climate, many\r\nrotting logs, and a moist ground cover of leaves and needles.\r\n\r\nMost of the mountains are covered with pine-oak forest, which in most\r\nplaces is decidedly subhumid, but where this forest occurs on the\r\nwindward sides of high ridges, it sometimes is noticeably humid. In\r\nthis forest the important animal habitats include the needle- and\r\nleaf-litter, and in some areas, bromeliads.\r\n\r\nThe rolling terrain of the Mexican Plateau supports cacti, small\r\nleguminous trees, and grasses. Like the arid tropical scrub forest, this\r\ntype of vegetation, the Mesquite-grassland association, is deciduous and\r\nthus provides little shelter in the dry season. Unlike the areas in\r\nwhich arid tropical scrub forest is developed, the Mesquite-grassland is\r\nfound in areas having warm days and cool nights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY OF THE HERPETOFAUNA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the main part of my final report on the herpetofauna of\r\nMichoacan will deal with the geographical and ecological patterns of\r\ndistribution of the herpetofauna, a brief summary of the faunal\r\nassemblages is presented here.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan there are two major faunal assemblages, one in the\r\nlowlands, and one in the highlands. A large number of the species\r\ninhabiting the lowlands are wide-ranging species, such as _Bufo\r\nmarinus_, _Iguana iguana_, and _Boa constrictor_. Sixty-three species\r\nare known to occur on the Pacific Coastal Plain; 41 of these, together\r\nwith 36 others occur in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, a physiographic\r\nregion to which several species of reptiles are endemic; for example,\r\n_Enyaliosaurus clarki_, _Urosaurus gadowi_, _Cnemidophorus calidipes_,\r\nand _Eumeces altamirani_.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the members of the highland faunal assemblage have\r\nmore restricted geographic ranges. The major exceptions are those\r\nspecies that are widely distributed on the Mexican Plateau, such as:\r\n_Bufo compactilis_, _Sceloporus torquatus_, and _Salvadora bairdi_. In\r\nthe montane habitats of the Cordillera Volcanica, 45 species of\r\namphibians and reptiles are known; 34 species have been found in the\r\nSierra de Coalcoman. Fourteen species are known to occur in both ranges.\r\nSeveral species are known only from the Cordillera Volcanica and\r\nadjacent highlands, and three species are endemic to the Sierra de\r\nCoalcoman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages the 176 species and subspecies of amphibians and\r\nreptiles known to occur in the state of Michoacan are discussed in\r\nrelation to their variation, life histories, ecology, and distribution\r\nin the state. Data have been gathered from 9676 specimens. I have not\r\nprolonged the accounts of species with information that has been\r\npresented elsewhere. Consequently, the length and completeness of the\r\naccounts are variable. I have given only the information that I consider\r\na worthwhile contribution to our knowledge of the particular species.\r\n\r\nThe synonymies given at the beginning of each account include the first\r\nuse of the trivial name by the original author, the first usage of the\r\ncombination that I am using, and, if the circumstances make it\r\nnecessary, additional names or combinations that have been proposed\r\nsince the publication of the checklists of Mexican amphibians and\r\nreptiles by Smith and Taylor (1945, 1948, and 1950b). References cited\r\nonly in the synonymies are not listed in the Literature Cited. Preceding\r\nthe discussion of each species is an alphabetical list of the localities\r\nin Michoacan from which specimens have been examined. The listing of a\r\nlocality means that one or more specimens, as indicated, has been\r\nexamined from that locality.

Aside from these, the largest larva examined (UMMZ 104962\r\nfrom 15 km. W of Morelia) has a snout-vent length of 70.0 mm. and a tail\r\nlength of 53.5 mm. The larvae are pale pinkish tan above and somewhat\r\npaler below; there is a lateral row of cream colored spots. The\r\ntail-fin, which is deepest at mid-length, extends to the back of the\r\nhead and is flecked with brown. In small larvae the outer edge of the\r\ntail-fin is dark brown. The eyes are large. Two small metamorphosed\r\nspecimens (UMMZ 98967) from 24 kilometers south of Patzcuaro are\r\ntentatively referred to this species. These specimens have body lengths\r\nof 49.0 and 45.0 mm. and tail lengths of 36.0 and 31.5 mm.,\r\nrespectively. They have 17-17 and 16-15 vomerine teeth arranged in a\r\nbroad arch behind the choanae, 10 costal grooves, and 7 intercostal\r\nspaces between adpressed toes. The dorsal color is uniform brown; that\r\nof the venter is a dusty cream.\r\n\r\nLarvae were collected from shallow ponds near Quiroga and 15 kilometers\r\nwest of Morelia; metamorphosed individuals were taken from beneath logs\r\nin pine and fir forests at elevations from 2300 to 2800 meters.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Ambystoma dumerili dumerili~ (Duges)\r\n\r\n     _Siredon Dumerili_ Duges, La Naturaleza, 1:241, 1870--Lago\r\n     de Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     _Bathysiredon dumerilii_, Dunn, Notulae Naturae, 36:1,\r\n     November 9, 1939.\r\n\r\n     _Bathysiredon dumerilii dumerilii_, Maldonado-Koerdell, Mem.\r\n     y Rev.

Morelia.\r\n\r\nFor many years this unusual salamander was known from only a few\r\nspecimens mostly collected in the last century; Smith and Taylor\r\n(1948:7) stated: \"It is presumed that this species is extinct owing to\r\nthe introduction of exotic game and food fishes.\" In 1951 and in 1955 I\r\nhad been told that _axolotls_ were sold in the market at Patzcuaro;\r\nnevertheless, none was found on my visits there. In 1956 Charles M.\r\nBogert obtained several large specimens at the market in Patzcuaro.\r\nThese establish the continued existence of the salamander in Lago de\r\nPatzcuaro. On January 27, 1955, R. W. Dickerman procured a specimen (KU\r\n41573) in the market at Morelia. Since fish are brought to Morelia from\r\nLago de Patzcuaro, the specimen probably was from that lake.\r\nNevertheless, the species may occur in other permanent bodies of water\r\nin Michoacan. Maldonado-Koerdell (1948) described _Bathysiredon dumerili\r\nqueretarensis_ from San Juan del Rio, Queretaro. This locality is about\r\n200 airline kilometers northeast of Lago de Patzcuaro and is in the Rio\r\nMoctezuma drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Ambystoma ordinarium~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Ambystoma ordinaria_ Taylor, Univ.

Possibly these specimens had just recently deposited their mature\r\neggs. In preservative the specimens are black above and dull creamy gray\r\nbelow. Measurements for the 15 females are: snout-vent length,\r\n80.0-102.0 (92.5); tail length, 69.0-93.0 (84.2); head width, 15.8-20.5\r\n(17.7); head length, 22.8-26.6 (24.4). A larval specimen with small\r\ngills has a snout-vent length of 72 mm. and a tail length of 62 mm.\r\nThree specimens have 12 costal grooves; the other have 11.\r\n\r\nOf 20 specimens from San Jose de la Cumbre (UMMZ 112857 and 115143), 14\r\nare neotenic adults; the others are larvae. In life the salamanders were\r\nblackish to olive-brown above with scattered cream-colored dots on the\r\ndorsum and flanks but in preservative are dull grayish black with\r\nindistinct pale spots and dark reticulations. The belly is pale gray\r\nwith indistinct dark spots. Eleven females and three males have the\r\nfollowing measurements, respectively: snout-vent length, 76.0-90.0\r\n(80.7), 64.0-84.0 (74.3); tail length, 70.0-81.0 (75.0), 58.0-71.0\r\n(66.7); head width, 19.5-23.5 (20.7), 17.5-20.5 (19.3); head length,\r\n22.0-25.0 (23.0), 20.0-22.5 (21.5). The smallest larva has a snout-vent\r\nlength of 43.0 mm. and a tail length of 38.0 mm. Two individuals have 12\r\ncostal grooves; the others have 11. All of the females contained eggs,\r\nthe largest of which were 1.5 mm. in diameter. The stomachs of most of\r\nthe specimens were distended with oligochaets, aquatic insect larvae,\r\nand small aquatic beetles.\r\n\r\nA series of 34 larvae (JRD 5904-37) from 46 kilometers east of Morelia\r\nare tentatively referred to this species. These specimens are\r\nolive-brown above with cream-colored spots on the flanks; the dorsal\r\ntail-fin does not extend onto the body.\r\n\r\nThis species has been found only at elevations in excess of 2400 meters\r\nin pine and fir forests. At Rancho Axolotl James A. Peters collected\r\nlarvae and neotenic individuals in a rocky stream and adults from\r\nbeneath rocks and logs in the forest near the stream. Neotenic\r\nindividuals and larvae were found in a clear stream in pine-fir forest\r\nat an elevation of 2700 meters near San Jose de la Cumbre; specimens\r\nwere collected there in July, 1955, and again in July, 1956. The site\r\nwas visited in April, 1956, at which time the stream consisted of only a\r\nfew puddles; no salamanders were found.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Ambystoma tigrinum velasci~ Duges\r\n\r\n     _Ambystoma velasci_ Duges, La Naturaleza, ser. 2, 1:142,\r\n     1888.--Laguna Santa Isabel, near Guadalupe Hidalgo, Distrito\r\n     Federal, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     _Ambystoma tigrinum velasci_, Dunn, Copeia, no. 3:157,\r\n     November 14, 1940.\r\n\r\n     Patzcuaro (5); Tacicuaro (9).\r\n\r\nDefinite specific assignment of these specimens, all larvae, cannot be\r\nmade at this time. They have shovel-shaped heads and laterally\r\ncompressed bodies with the dorsal tail-fin extending anteriorly to the\r\nback of the head. The eyes are small. The body is pale tan with dark\r\nmottling on the tail and flanks. The average snout-vent length for nine\r\nspecimens from Tacicuaro is 61.0 mm.\r\n\r\nThe larvae from Tacicuaro (UMMZ 89255) were collected by Dyfrig Forbes\r\nin October, 1939; those from Patzcuaro, presumably Lago de Patzcuaro\r\n(BMNH 1914.1.28-247-8 and CNHM 948), were collected by Hans Gadow and\r\nSeth Meek in 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Pseudoeurycea belli~ (Gray)\r\n\r\n     _Spelerpes belli_ Gray, Catalogue Batrachia Gradientia\r\n     British Museum, p. 46, 1850.--Mexico.

It is found less commonly\r\nin the eastern part of the Cordillera Volcanica in Michoacan, where it\r\nsometimes occurs in association with _Pseudoeurycea robertsi_.\r\n\r\nOn June 22 and 23, 1955, four clutches of eggs of this species were\r\nfound beneath adobe bricks and rocks on the volcanic ash that has buried\r\nthe village of San Juan de Parangaricutiro. The eggs were unstalked and\r\nseparate, but adherent in clumps of three or four (Pl. 2, Fig. 1). The\r\nouter membranes were covered with fine particles of ash. The ash beneath\r\nthe stones where the eggs were found was only slightly moist; one clump\r\nof eggs was partially desiccated. Three complete clutches have 20, 23,\r\nand 34 eggs; one clutch of 15 eggs was being eaten by beetles\r\n(Tenebrionidae: _Eleodes_ sp.). The eggs vary in size from 4.6 to 6.5\r\nmm. and average 5.3 mm. in diameter. They are unpigmented. Surrounding\r\nthe embryo is a vitelline membrane, an inner, and an outer envelope\r\n(Fig. 1). In an average-sized egg having an embryo 4 mm. in length, the\r\ndiameter of the outer membrane is 5.3 mm., the inner membrane 5.0 mm.,\r\nand the vitelline membrane 4.6 mm. All of the eggs contained embryos in\r\nwhich the limb buds were developed; in about half of these the eyes were\r\ndistinctly visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Diagram of an egg of _Pseudoeurycea belli_ from\r\nSan Juan de Parangaricutiro, Michoacan. x 10.]\r\n\r\nThe first heavy rain of the season occurred on the night of June 22,\r\n1955. Thus, at least sometimes, _Pseudoeurycea belli_ lays its eggs\r\nbefore the onset of the rainy season. A female having a snout-vent\r\nlength of 110 mm., collected on June 22, 1955, contained 36 ovarian eggs\r\nhaving diameters from 3.0 to 3.5 mm. The fact that small juveniles were\r\ncollected on the same date indicates that this salamander lays eggs over\r\na period of several weeks in late spring and early summer.\r\n\r\nThe smallest juvenile examined has a snout-vent length of 17.0 mm. and a\r\ntail length of 7.5 mm. Twelve juveniles from the vicinity of San Juan de\r\nParangaricutiro have an average snout-vent length of 19.4 mm. and an\r\naverage tail length of 9.7 mm. In juveniles the adpressed limbs either\r\ntouch or overlap by one intercostal space; in adults there are two or\r\nthree intercostal spaces between adpressed toes. Therefore the greatest\r\nnumber of intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs is found in the\r\nlargest specimens. A similar relationship between adpressed limbs (=\r\nlength of limbs) and snout-vent length was shown for _Plethodon\r\nrichmondi_ by Duellman (1954a). The number of vomerine teeth is\r\nvariable; the number of teeth seems to be closely correlated with the\r\nsize of the salamander (Fig. 2). A similar correlation between the\r\nnumber of maxillary teeth and body length was reported for\r\n_Chiropterotriton multidentatus_ by Rabb (1958). In 12 juvenile\r\n_Pseudoeurycea belli_ there are 6-13 (8.8) vomerine teeth, and in 11\r\nadults having snout-vent lengths greater than 90 mm. there are 39-49\r\n(44.0) vomerine teeth. The coloration of the juveniles resembles that of\r\nthe adults (Pl. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Correlation between the number of vomerine teeth\r\nand snout-vent length in 79 _Pseudoeurycea belli_ from Michoacan.]\r\n\r\nThe differences between this species and _Pseudoeurycea gigantea_ are\r\nminor. Taylor (1939a) distinguished _gigantea_ from _belli_ by the\r\nlarger size, fewer intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs, more\r\nvomerine teeth, and absence of occipital spots in _gigantea_. Taylor and\r\nSmith (1945) stated that in life the spots in _gigantea_ are orange\r\ninstead of red as in _belli_. Five specimens of _Pseudoeurycea belli_\r\nfrom Michoacan, including one juvenile, lack occipital spots. In the 34\r\nliving individuals that I have seen from Michoacan the spots varied from\r\ndeep red to orange. Therefore, of the characters listed by Taylor (_op.\r\ncit._) to diagnose _Pseudoeurycea gigantea_, only the over-all larger\r\nsize and smaller number of intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs (=\r\nrelatively longer limbs) are useful in separating _Pseudoeurycea belli_\r\nand _gigantea_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Pseudoeurycea robertsi~ (Taylor)\r\n\r\n     _Oedipus robertsi_ Taylor, Univ.

On August 20, 1958, a series was\r\ncollected in pine-fir forest at Puerto Lengua de Vaca. These localities\r\nare between 2900 and 3000 meters in the Cordillera Volcanica in eastern\r\nMichoacan.\r\n\r\nIn life the coloration of these salamanders was highly variable. The\r\nbelly and undersurfaces of the tail and hind limbs were pale gray, with\r\nor without silvery white flecks; the chin was a cream-color and flecked\r\nwith silvery white in some specimens. The middorsal area was brown,\r\norange-brown, or dull grayish yellow. The flanks and lateral surfaces of\r\nthe tail were black with yellowish flecks or streaks on the flanks and\r\nyellowish or orange-brown flecks on the tail. The iris was golden brown.\r\nMeasurements of eight males and two females are, respectively:\r\nsnout-vent length, 42.5-56.0 (49.5), 54.0-60.0 (57.0); tail length,\r\n42.0-56.0 (48.1), 52.0-55.0 (53.5). The smallest juvenile has a\r\nsnout-vent length of 28.0 mm. and a tail length of 23.0 mm. Of the 26\r\navailable specimens, six have 12 costal grooves, and the others have 11.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with 36 topotypes, the specimens from Michoacan have a\r\nless striking dorsal color pattern; none has a well-defined dorsal\r\nreddish brown area or bold reddish mottling on the tail. Furthermore,\r\nthe specimens from Michoacan have paler venters than do topotypic\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalientia\r\n\r\n\r\n~Rhinophrynus dorsalis~ Dumeril and Bibron\r\n\r\n     _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_ Dumeril and Bibron, Erpetologie\r\n     generale, vol. 8:758, 1841.--Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Mouth of the Rio Balsas (10).\r\n\r\nThese specimens (BMNH 1914.1.28.181-90) were collected by Gadow in 1908\r\nand reported by him (1930:72): \"Whilst this very sluggish termite-eating\r\ntoad is common enough in the sweltering hot country of the state of Vera\r\nCruz, up to an elevation of 1500 feet, it was unknown on the west side\r\nof the Isthmus until I found it in great numbers near the mouth of the\r\nBalsas River, in and near fresh-water pools, where it attracted\r\nattention by its loud peculiar voice during the pairing season in the\r\nmonth of July.\" Subsequently, Peters (1954:3) verified the\r\nidentification of these specimens. Although torrential rains fell during\r\nthe week in July, 1955, that I spent at Playa Azul near the mouth of the\r\nRio Balsas, the distinctive voice of _Rhinophrynus_ was not heard.\r\nElsewhere on the Pacific coast of Mexico adult _Rhinophrynus_ have been\r\nreported only from Tehuantepec and a few localities on the coastal\r\nlowlands of Chiapas. Taylor (1942b:37) found on the coast of Guerrero a\r\ntadpole that was referred to the genus _Rhinophrynus_ by Orton (1943).\r\nIn the summer of 1960 adults of _Rhinophrynus_ were collected near\r\nAcapulco, Guerrero (Fouquette, _in litt._).

Those from\r\nMichoacan have low and narrow cranial crests; in about one-half of the\r\nspecimens the occipital crest exists only as a row of tubercles, and in\r\nsome the postorbital and suborbital crests are barely discernible.\r\nSpecimens from the southern part of the range, Costa Rica and Nicaragua,\r\nhave much higher and thicker cranial crests; in these the occipital\r\ncrest is well defined and extends posteriorly to a point back of the\r\nanterior edge of the parotid gland; the postorbital and suborbital\r\ncrests are well marked. Of 48 specimens from Esquipulas, Guatemala, all\r\nhave high crests, but these are not so well developed as in ten\r\nspecimens from Matagalpa, Nicaragua, and three from various localities\r\nin Costa Rica. Six specimens from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, have cranial\r\ncrests that are lower than those in specimens from Guatemala. In three\r\nof the specimens from Tehuantepec the occipital crests are reduced to a\r\nseries of tubercles. Of six specimens from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero,\r\nfour have poorly developed occipital crests. These observations suggest\r\nthe presence of a cline in the development of the cranial crests;\r\nspecimens have higher crests in the southern part of the range than in\r\nthe northern part.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico _Bufo coccifer_ has been collected only in semi-xeric\r\nhabitats, but to the south, from Guatemala to Costa Rica, it has been\r\nfound in more upland and humid habitats. Southern specimens are darker\r\nthan those from the north, a possible correlation with the differences\r\nin habitat.\r\n\r\nThese toads probably range throughout the Tepalcatepec Valley, but they\r\nare unknown from the coast of Michoacan. Breeding choruses were found\r\nafter heavy rains on June 24, 1955, and on August 2, 1956. The first was\r\nin a muddy ditch; the second was in a flooded grassy field. The call is\r\na high-pitched, but not loud, \"whirrr.\" Males were calling from the edge\r\nof the water or from clumps of grass in the water. Clasping pairs were\r\nin the water; amplexus is axillary.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Bufo compactilis compactilis~ Wiegmann\r\n\r\n     _Bufo compactilis_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 26:661,\r\n     1833.--Mexico.

The species is much\r\nmore abundant than the numbers listed above suggest. In the dry season\r\nindividuals have been observed in patios, along streams, and by\r\nirrigation ditches. In the rainy season the loud, rattling call of the\r\nmales is heard at night throughout the Tepalcatepec Valley and the\r\ncoastal lowlands.\r\n\r\nTaylor and Smith (1945:552) revived Wiegmann's _Bufo horribilis_ for the\r\nlarge toads of Mexico that are here referred to _B. marinus_. Their\r\naction was based upon the supposition that the \"species _marinus_\" is\r\ncomposite. Although probably true, this supposition has yet to be\r\nproved. Until the large, and apparently related, species of _Bufo_\r\ninhabiting tropical America have been studied systematically as a unit,\r\nthe recognition of segments of the population as either species or\r\nsubspecies is meaningless. Taylor and Smith (op. cit.:553) based the\r\ndescription of a new species, _Bufo angustipes_, on one rather\r\nemaciated, formalin-hardened female from La Esperanza, Chiapas. The type\r\n(USNM 116513), when compared with numerous specimens of _Bufo marinus_\r\nfrom throughout the range of the species in Mexico and northern Central\r\nAmerica, displays no combination of characters to set it off from the\r\nothers. Therefore, I suggest that _Bufo horribilis_ Wiegmann and _Bufo\r\nangustipes_ Taylor and Smith be placed in the synonymy of _Bufo marinus_\r\n(Linnaeus) until future systematic study of the genus and this species\r\nin particular establishes the existence of recognizable taxa.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Bufo marmoreus~ Wiegmann\r\n\r\n     _Bufo marmoreus_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 26:66,\r\n     1833.--Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Barranca de Bejuco; Coahuayana (11); El Diezmo (2); La\r\n     Placita (9); La Orilla (12); Motin del Oro; Ostula (9);\r\n     Playa Azul (5); Pomaro (15); Salitre de Estopilas; San Pedro\r\n     Naranjestila.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan this species is confined to elevations of less than 1000\r\nmeters on the coast and foothills of the Sierra de Coalcoman. In this\r\nregion in the months of June and July, breeding congregations have been\r\nfound in temporary pools and along streams.\r\n\r\nSmith and Taylor (1948:39), in their key to the Mexican species of\r\n_Bufo_, placed emphasis on the nature of the supraorbital and\r\npostorbital crests (whether they form a curve or a sharp angle) in\r\ndistinguishing _Bufo marmoreus_ from _Bufo perplexus_. In the original\r\ndescription of _perplexus_, Taylor (1943a:347) characterized the species\r\nas follows: supraorbital and postorbital crests forming a sharp angle,\r\ninstead of a curve as in _marmoreus_; supratympanic crest smaller than\r\nin _marmoreus_; diagonal lateral stripe lacking in females;\r\nconcentration of dorsal tubercles as found in _marmoreus_ lacking in\r\nmales. The discovery of specimens in which the crests form a curve and\r\nothers in which the crests form an angle in both the Tepalcatepec Valley\r\nand in the coastal lowlands prompted an investigation of these\r\ncharacters and others throughout the ranges of the species. An\r\nexamination of 410 specimens has resulted in the following conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--VARIATION IN THE SHAPE OF THE SUPRAORBITAL AND POSTORBITAL\r\nCRANIAL CRESTS IN BUFO MARMOREUS AND B.

A distinct, pale-colored, diagonal lateral stripe is\r\n     found in females only from localities outside of the\r\n     Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin; females from the basin have a\r\n     spotted dorsum.\r\n\r\n     5. Males from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin usually have a\r\n     broad middorsal line that is yellow or pale tan; those from\r\n     outside the basin have either a narrow middorsal line or\r\n     none.\r\n\r\n     6. Males from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin have low,\r\n     scattered dorsal tubercles (Fig. 3); males from outside the\r\n     basin have a concentration of tubercles in a broad band on\r\n     the back (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nTherefore the nature of the cranial crests is of little value in\r\nseparating two populations, but the color pattern of the females and the\r\nnature of the dorsal tubercles of the males do show distinct\r\ndifferences. Furthermore, certain differences in size and proportion are\r\nevident; _Bufo marmoreus_ is a slightly larger toad and has a relatively\r\nlonger tibia and longer head than _perplexus_ (Table 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.--COMPARISON OF CERTAIN MEASUREMENTS AND PROPORTIONS IN BUFO\r\nMARMOREUS AND B.

Among the many paratypes are specimens from Tonola,\r\nChiapas, and Tehuantepec, Oaxaca. These apparently were referred to\r\n_perplexus_ solely on the nature of the cranial crests. All of the\r\nspecimens examined during the course of the present study from the\r\nlowlands of Veracruz and from the Pacific lowlands from Sinaloa\r\nsouthward to Chiapas are referable to _Bufo marmoreus_; those from the\r\nBalsas-Tepalcatepec Basin are referable to _Bufo perplexus_, as defined\r\nabove. Ten specimens from Chilpancingo, Guerrero (UMMZ 115352), do not\r\nreadily fit either species. Perhaps there is gene exchange between the\r\ninland and coastal populations through the relatively low pass at\r\nChilpancingo, at the mouth of the Rio Balsas, and near the convergent\r\nheadwaters of the Rio Coahuayana and Rio Tepalcatepec in southern\r\nJalisco. If this can be demonstrated, then _Bufo perplexus_ would have\r\nto be considered as a subspecies of _Bufo marmoreus_, instead of an\r\nallopatric species.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Bufo perplexus~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Bufo perplexus_ Taylor, Univ.

Near Charapendo on the slopes of the Sierra de los Tarascos and\r\nat Coalcoman it apparently reaches its lowest altitudinal limits. At\r\nboth of these localities the pine-oak forest is replaced by arid\r\ntropical scrub forest on the lower slopes.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four tadpoles were collected on May 3 in a quiet section of a\r\nfast stream near Barranca Seca. The tadpoles have a robust body,\r\nbroadest about two-thirds the distance from the snout to the posterior\r\nedge of the body, half again as broad as deep. Eyes dorsolateral;\r\nnostrils dorsal, somewhat directed forward, and about three-fifths the\r\ndistance from the tip of the snout to the eye; spiracle sinistral and\r\nlateral, located at about midbody; anus median; tail long and slender;\r\ntail-musculature extends nearly to tip of tail; depth of\r\ntail-musculature at mid-length about one-third total depth of tail;\r\ndorsal tail-fin not extending onto body (Fig. 5); average body length of\r\nten tadpoles having small hind limb buds, 14.4 mm.; average tail length,\r\n22.0 mm.\r\n\r\nMouth ventral, nearly terminal, about one-third as wide as widest part\r\nof body; anterior lip has no papillae; lower lip bordered by two rows of\r\npapillae and lateral lips by one row of papillae; beaks moderately well\r\ndeveloped, the upper forming a broad arch and finely denticulate; tooth\r\nrows 2/3, the upper rows extending to the edge of the lips, subequal in\r\nlength, and slightly longer than lower rows, which also are subequal in\r\nlength; inner upper tooth row broken medially; inner lower tooth row\r\nsometimes broken (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nThe body is black dorsally and laterally, and bluish gray ventrally; the\r\ntail musculature is brown and stippled with darker brown. The fins are\r\ntransparent and stippled with brown, the stippling being most pronounced\r\non the posterior two-thirds of the upper tail-fin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.

In _Bufo occidentalis_ the tympanum usually is indistinct and\r\nsometimes completely covered, and it is absent in _bocourti_. _Bufo\r\noccidentalis_ has a broader interorbital area and relatively shorter and\r\nmore rounded parotid glands than _bocourti_.

Kansas Acad.\r\n     Sci., 39:349, 1937.--Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Five km. W of Tangamandapio.\r\n\r\nOn the night of June 11, 1958, this species was calling from a\r\nhyacinth-choked ditch. Although numerous individuals were heard, only\r\none specimen was obtained. The frogs were calling from the tangled mat\r\nof hyacinths along with _Hyla eximia_, _Hypopachus oxyrrhinus ovis_, and\r\n_Rana pipiens_.\r\n\r\nTaylor (1936a:352) characterized this species as follows: \"The narrow\r\nhead, small maximum size (38 mm. for females, 33 mm. for males), the\r\ncharacter of the postaxillary and postfemoral glands, the narrower\r\ngroups of vomerine teeth, clearly distinguish this western Mexican form\r\nfrom the more robust, larger _melanonotus_ to the south. The call is\r\nlikewise fainter and different in quality.\" Concerning the glands,\r\nTaylor (_loc. cit._) remarked: \"There is a possibility that the horny\r\nexcrescence covering the glands may appear only during the breeding\r\nseason. This character is quite as strongly marked in females as in\r\nmales.\" Bogert and Oliver (1945:324) concluded that the population of\r\n_Leptodactylus_ in northwestern Mexico could not be distinguished from\r\n_melanonotus_ in other parts of the country and thus synonymized\r\n_Leptodactylus occidentalis_ with _melanonotus_. Bogert and Oliver (op.\r\ncit.: 324) stated that the extent as well as the presence or absence of\r\nventral glands was highly variable in all samples examined by them.\r\n\r\nUpon seeing numerous living individuals of _Leptodactylus melanonotus_\r\nfrom many parts of its range in Mexico and individuals of the population\r\nof _Leptodactylus_ in northwestern Mexico (Nayarit and Sinaloa), I was\r\nimmediately impressed not so much by the differences in the development\r\nof the ventral glands, but by the color of the glands. The differences\r\nin color are apparent in freshly preserved specimens. With the exception\r\nof _Leptodactylus_ from northwestern Mexico, specimens of _melanonotus_\r\nfrom throughout Mexico and northern Central America have yellow or\r\nyellowish brown glands. Specimens from northwestern Mexico have black or\r\nbrownish black glands that are conspicuously darker than those found in\r\n_melanonotus_. Examination of 653 preserved specimens of _Leptodactylus\r\nmelanonotus_ from Mexico and Guatemala has failed to reveal specimens\r\nwith black ventral glands, like those found in specimens from\r\nnorthwestern Mexico, to which the name _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ has\r\nbeen applied. Furthermore, in _melanonotus_ the glands are less distinct\r\nand more extensive than in _occidentalis_; in the latter species glands\r\nare absent from the throat and midventral area, where they often are\r\npresent in _melanonotus_ (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\nIn some individuals of both species collected in the dry season and in\r\nsome collected in the rainy (breeding) season the glands are absent; the\r\ndevelopment of these glands, therefore, does not seem to be correlated\r\nwith breeding. Likewise, the glands are present or absent in either sex,\r\nand often as not they are present in juveniles. Presence of the glands,\r\ntherefore, cannot be correlated either with sexual or ontogenetic\r\ndevelopment. Since the glands are found in individuals from all parts of\r\nthe range, it is unlikely that there is a correlation between the\r\ndevelopment of the glands and the environment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Diagrammatic view of ventral surfaces of\r\n_Leptodactylus melanonotus_ (A) and _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ (B),\r\nshowing usual position and size of glandular areas. Approx. natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nAside from the differences in the ventral glands, the call is different\r\nin the two populations. The call of _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ is a\r\nrather harsh \"wack, wack, wack\" as contrasted with the more nasal\r\n\"woink, woink, woink\" of _melanonotus_. Sound spectrographs are needed\r\nto analyze the differences in calls. None of the specimens of\r\n_occidentalis_ examined approaches in size the largest individuals of\r\n_melanonotus_; possibly the size of the frogs is another valid character\r\nfor separating the species. On the basis of the above data it is evident\r\nthat the frogs in northwestern Mexico show certain characters that\r\ndistinguish them from _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, as it is known\r\nthroughout the rest of Mexico. It is not known for certain that\r\n_melanonotus_ and _occidentalis_ are sympatric. Several series of old,\r\npoorly preserved specimens from Nayarit and Sinaloa cannot be placed in\r\neither species, for none has visible ventral glands. _Leptodactylus\r\nmelanonotus_ is known from Acaponeta, Nayarit (AMNH 43913-25), and the\r\nfollowing localities in Jalisco: Barro de Navidad (UMMZ 118098), La\r\nConcepcion (UMMZ 113081), La Resolana (UMMZ 102104), and Tenachitlan\r\n(UMMZ 113045-6). Records for _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ are: Alamos,\r\nSonora (AMNH 51356-65); Culiacan (AMNH 49511-9), Chele (UMMZ 110914),\r\nand Rosario (UMMZ 113062) in Sinaloa; Ixtlan del Rio (UMMZ 102108), San\r\nBlas (UMMZ 112814, 112994, 110892, 115543), and Tepic (UMMZ 115544) in\r\nNayarit; Ameca (UMMZ 102106-7) and La Cofradia on the south shore of\r\nLago de Chapala (UMMZ 102105) in Jalisco; and Tangamandapio, Michoacan\r\n(UMMZ 119145). From these scattered records it appears that\r\n_Leptodactylus occidentalis_ in the southern part of its range stays in\r\nthe uplands, whereas _melanonotus_ is confined to the lowlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi~ (Taylor)\r\n\r\n     _Eleutherodactylus hobartsmithi_ Taylor, Trans.

The other specimen (UMMZ 94231) has in preservative a\r\ndark brown dorsolateral line on each side enclosing a pale tan area that\r\nextends from the snout to the vent. One specimen from 29 kilometers east\r\nof Morelia (UIMNH 40338) and 13 specimens from San Jose de la Cumbre\r\n(UMMZ 102111) do not have the prominent tarsal tubercles characteristic\r\nof _M. hobartsmithi_. Also, in these fourteen specimens the palmar\r\ntubercles are larger, and the dark anal patch more distinct, than in\r\ntypical _M. hobartsmithi_. Possibly these specimens, which are from the\r\nhigh mountains in the eastern part of Michoacan, represent another\r\nspecies of _Microbatrachylus_. However, Taylor (1940d:501) reported a\r\nseries of _M. hobartsmithi_ from the mountains 10 miles west of Villa\r\nVictoria in the western part of the state of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe largest specimen from Michoacan is a gravid female (UIMNH 16104)\r\nhaving a snout-vent length of 23.5 mm.\r\n\r\n_Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi_ has been found in rocky ravines along\r\nstreams in the Cordillera Volcanica and the southwestern escarpment of\r\nthese mountains at elevations from 1450 to 2750 meters.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Microbatrachylus pygmaeus~ (Taylor)\r\n\r\n     _Eleutherodactylus pygmaeus_ Taylor, Trans.

The frogs were found in a\r\nshaded ravine at the north edge of Arteaga; they were obtained during\r\nthe day, at which time they were actively moving about in the leaf\r\nlitter along a small stream.\r\n\r\nThese frogs are all referred to _M. pygmaeus_, because this is the\r\nearliest name available for frogs showing the variation in\r\ncharacteristics displayed by this large series. The characters used by\r\nTaylor (1936a, 1940d, 1941a, and 1942b) and Smith and Taylor (1948) to\r\ndistinguish the various species of _Microbatrachylus_ include color\r\npattern, relative length of the hind limb, presence and position of\r\ndorsal dermal folds or pustules, relative size of inner and outer\r\nmetatarsal tubercles, and the number of palmar tubercles. All specimens\r\nfrom Arteaga have two palmar tubercles; the inner and outer metatarsal\r\ntubercles are subequal in size. Furthermore, aside from sexual\r\ndifference, there is little variation in the relative length of the hind\r\nlimbs (Table 3). However, many color patterns do exist in the series;\r\neach of these color patterns is described below.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.--SNOUT-VENT LENGTH EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TIBIA LENGTH IN\r\nANIMALS OF SIX COLOR PATTERNS OF MICROBATRACHYLUS PYGMAEUS.

A faint dermal ridge from posterior edge of eyelid to rump, or\r\npart way to rump.\r\n\r\nF.--2 specimens: Mottled brown and cream-color above; upper lips and\r\nupper arms white. A dermal fold from posterior edge of eyelid to rump;\r\nscattered pustules on dorsum.\r\n\r\nSome of these color variants are assignable to names proposed by Taylor:\r\n\"A\" and \"B\" undoubtedly are _M. pygmaeus_ (Taylor, 1936a); \"C\" probably\r\nis _M. pygmaeus_; \"D\" is referable to _M. minimus_ (Taylor, 1940d) in\r\nmost characteristics, although the coloration is more nearly like that\r\nof _M. lineatissimus_ (Taylor, 1941a), a larger species characterized by\r\na relatively long hind limb; \"E\" apparently is _M. imitator_ (Taylor,\r\n1942b); \"F\" is _M. albolabris_ (Taylor, 1940d). Examination of series of\r\nthese frogs from other parts of Mexico shows a similar composition of\r\ncolor variants. Of 78 specimens from the Rio Sarabia and the village of\r\nSarabia in Oaxaca (UMMZ 115428-37), 57 are \"A,\" six are \"D,\" three are\r\n\"E,\" and 12 are \"F\"; of 22 specimens from Teapa, Tabasco (UMMZ 113829),\r\n11 are \"A,\" five are \"D,\" two are \"E,\" and four are \"F\"; of 33 specimens\r\nfrom Potrero Viejo, Veracruz (USNM 115447-58, 115461-71, 116840-2,\r\n116864-70), ten are \"A,\" 13 are \"E,\" and ten are \"F\"; of 31 specimens\r\nfrom La Esperanza, Chiapas (USNM 115477-9, 116827-39, 116849-63), 28 are\r\n\"A\" and four are \"F.\"\r\n\r\nIt is highly doubtful if these color variants are actually distinct\r\nspecies. Goin (1950 and 1954) in his studies of inheritance of color\r\npattern in West Indian species of the genus _Eleutherodactylus_ has\r\nshown that similar color pattern variants come from the same clutch of\r\neggs; furthermore, Goin has worked out the genetic ratios of certain of\r\nthese variants. Heathwole (_in litt._) obtained \"normal\" specimens and\r\nindividuals having a broad middorsal stripe (\"C\" in figure 9) from a\r\nclutch of eggs of _Eleutherodactylus gollmeri_. The presence of a broad\r\nmiddorsal yellow stripe is common in _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect of variability in color pattern in\r\nMexican eleutherodactylids is the parallelism between members of the\r\n_Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_-group and some members of\r\n_Microbatrachylus_. In the former group there are white-lipped\r\nindividuals (_Eleutherodactylus beatae_ Boulenger), individuals having a\r\nunicolor reddish or yellowish dorsum (_E. dorsoconcolor_ Taylor), and\r\nindividuals having a dorsal pattern of irregular longitudinal brown and\r\ncream-colored streaks (_E. venustus_ Guenther). In the humid forests of\r\nsouthern Veracruz, northern Oaxaca, and Chiapas members of both groups\r\noccur sympatrically. A proper understanding of the evolutionary\r\nsignificance of these variants in the two groups, as well as proper\r\nallocation of the presently recognized species, must await experimental\r\nevidence based on studies of the inheritance of color pattern.\r\nNevertheless, at present it is apparent that certain characters,\r\nespecially the nature of the dermal folds and pustules, and the color\r\npattern, are of little taxonomic value in distinguishing \"species\" of\r\n_Microbatrachylus_. The data derived from a study of the large series\r\nfrom Arteaga, together with that from the other series examined,\r\nsuggests that _Microbatrachylus albolabris_, _imitator_, _minimus_, and\r\n_pygmaeus_ are morphotypes of one species. Of these names, _pygmaeus_ is\r\nthe oldest. Consequently _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ has been used here\r\nfor the series from Arteaga.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi_, a species distinguished from\r\nall of the above by the presence of tubercles on the outer edge of the\r\ntarsus, is known from Michoacan northward into Nayarit,\r\n_Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ previously has not been known north of\r\nGuerrero, where it occurs in habitats similar to that in which it was\r\ncollected at Arteaga.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Eleutherodactylus augusti cactorum~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Eleutherodactylus cactorum_ Taylor, Univ.

SW of\r\n     Coire (3); La Placita (7); Los Reyes; Ostula (4); Pomaro\r\n     (2).\r\n\r\nThe locality records for this species suggest that it is a member of a\r\ngroup of animals, the distribution of which includes the western part of\r\nthe Mexican Plateau and the Pacific lowlands. In Michoacan this frog\r\nhas been collected in pine-oak forest at Cascada Tzararacua and at Los\r\nReyes, in arid scrub forest at Arteaga and Coalcoman, and in tropical\r\nsemi-deciduous forest on the lower Pacific slopes of the Sierra de\r\nCoalcoman. On July 5, 1950, James Peters (1954:6) found calling males at\r\nLa Placita.\r\n\r\nMost of the specimens are immature; four adult males have snout-vent\r\nlengths of 30.9-33.0 (32.2) mm. In all specimens the first finger is\r\nnoticeably longer than the second; the inner metatarsal tubercle is\r\nlarge, flat, and cream-colored, contrasting with the dark brown sole of\r\nthe foot. When the hind limbs are adpressed, the heels broadly overlap.\r\nCharacteristically, a dark line extends from the snout, through the eye,\r\nabove the tympanum, to a point above the insertion of the forelimb.\r\nUsually there is a dark bar behind the tympanum, two dark brown bars\r\nfrom the eye to the mouth and thence onto the lower jaw, and another\r\ndark bar on the upper lip between the eye and nostril. One adult from\r\nArteaga, an adult and a juvenile from La Placita, and one juvenile each\r\nfrom Coire, Ostula, and Pomaro, have the lower lip barred with dark\r\nbrown and white, and have a white stripe extending the length of the\r\nupper lip. In life the dorsum varies from dark gray or olive-brown to\r\ntan or reddish brown.\r\n\r\nThis species belongs to a group containing two other populations that\r\nare currently recognized as species--_calcitrans_, known only from\r\nOmiltemi, Guerrero, and _mexicanus_, reported from the mountains of\r\nOaxaca. Another apparently undescribed member of this group has been\r\ncollected in the mountains of northern Puebla.

The iris was grayish\r\nbrown. In contrast, individuals from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero, had pale\r\ngolden eyes; specimens from Matias Romero, Oaxaca, had gold eyes heavily\r\nflecked with gray; and individuals from Volcan San Martin, Veracruz, had\r\nbronze eyes.\r\n\r\nThe use of the trinomial here is arbitrary. Frogs of the\r\n_Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ group in Mexico (_rugulosus_, _avocalis_,\r\nand _vocalis_) exhibit only slight differences in size, proportions, and\r\ncoloration (Duellman, 1958c:6). Furthermore, the named populations are\r\nallopatric. _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus vocalis_, as defined by\r\nDuellman (_loc. cit._), occurs in the foothills of the Sierra Madre\r\nOccidental and associated ranges from central Sinaloa southward into\r\nMichoacan.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Tomodactylus angustidigitorum~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Tomadactylus angustidigitorum_ Taylor, Univ.

A re-examination of this specimen,\r\nand examination of ten others from the same locality (UMMZ 121571)\r\nreveals that the relatively small size of the tympanum and absence of\r\ndense ventral spotting place these specimens closer to _T. nitidus\r\nnitidus_ than to _T. nitidus petersi_.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from Tuxpan (UMMZ 114303-4) had in life a gray to olive\r\ntan ground color with dark olive-green markings, bright yellow thighs\r\nwith olive-green transverse bands, yellowish tan shanks with olive-green\r\nbars, yellow groin, white inguinal glands with black markings, grayish\r\nwhite belly with scattered brownish black spots in some specimens, and a\r\ndeep golden iris (Pl. 4, Fig. 1).

Twelve of these specimens\r\nare adult males having snout-vent lengths of 20.7 to 24.6 (22.5) mm. One\r\nfemale has a snout-vent length of 24.8 mm., and one juvenile has a\r\nsnout-vent length of 14.5 mm. Six specimens are from a region of mixture\r\nof pine-oak forest and arid tropical scrub forest at 18 kilometers east\r\nof Dos Aguas (UMMZ 121497, 121500). All are males having snout-vent\r\nlengths of 18.0 to 22.6 (20.7) mm. The dorsum is tan marked with black;\r\nthe thighs are yellowish orange.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from 18 kilometers east of Dos Aguas were found on July\r\n22, 1960, by Floyd L. Downs and John Winklemann, who collected calling\r\nmales of _Tomodactylus rufescens_ and _Tomodactylus nitidus petersi_ at\r\nthe same locality. Downs (_personal communication_) stated the call was\r\na single note. At Dos Aguas I heard _T. rufescens_ give two calls, one a\r\nsingle \"peep,\" the other a triple note--\"pee-ee-eep.\"\r\n\r\nIn the higher parts of the Sierra de Coalcoman _Tomodactylus rufescens_\r\nseems to fill the same niche as _T. angustidigitorum_ does in the\r\nCordillera Volcanica. At lower elevations in their respective mountain\r\nranges the species occur sympatrically with _T. nitidus petersi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Diaglena reticulata~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Diaglena reticulata_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,\r\n     28:60, May 15, 1942.--Cerro Arenal, Oaxaca, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Nueva Italia (3); Ostula (7).\r\n\r\nUntil recently frogs of the genus _Diaglena_ were known only from a few\r\nspecimens from southern Sinaloa (_Diaglena spatulata_) and from the\r\nPacific lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (_Diaglena reticulata_).\r\nPeters (1955a) reported specimens from Ostula, Michoacan, and compared\r\nthese specimens with one _D. reticulata_ from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, and\r\nfour _D. spatulata_ from Sinaloa. This comparison showed that the\r\nspecimens from Michoacan, although showing some minor differences from\r\n_D. reticulata_, are closer to that species than to _D. spatulata_.\r\nSubsequent to Peters' work, series of both species of _Diaglena_,\r\nincluding additional specimens from Michoacan and from Colima, have been\r\ncollected, and a more qualified comparison is now possible.\r\n\r\nIn comparing specimens of _D. spatulata_ from southern Sinaloa (UMMZ\r\n115322) with specimens of _D. reticulata_ from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca (UMMZ\r\n115321), the differences noted by Taylor (1942c:60) were found to be\r\nconstant. But specimens from Ostula, Michoacan (UMMZ 104418), and five\r\nindividuals from Colima (TNHC 26379-83) were found to be intermediate in\r\ncertain characters. The skin of the dorsum in _D. reticulata_ is\r\ngranular; that in _D. spatulata_ is smooth. The skin in specimens from\r\nOstula and Colima is slightly granular. The dorsal ground color of _D.\r\nreticulata_ is yellowish brown with dark reticulations; the dorsal\r\nground color of _D. spatulata_ is olive-green. Specimens from Ostula and\r\nColima most closely resemble those from Tehuantepec in coloration, but\r\nthe reticulations are more coarse, and the ground color has an\r\nolive-green tint. _Diaglena reticulata_ also differs from _D.\r\nspatulata_ in having a larger over-all size, slightly broader head, a\r\nnarrower interorbital distance, and a more pointed snout with a deeper\r\nlabial shelf (Table 4). The specimens from Ostula and Colima are\r\nintermediate between _D. reticulata_ from Oaxaca and _D. spatulata_ from\r\nSinaloa in body proportions.\r\n\r\nOf three specimens from the Tepalcatepec Valley (JRD 5991-3), only two\r\nare suitable for measuring. These specimens are smaller than adults from\r\nthe coastal areas and have broader heads and snouts, but narrower\r\ninterorbital distances, than specimens in the other samples (Table 4).\r\nThe texture of the skin is like that of specimens from Ostula and\r\nColima. The coloration resembles that of _D. reticulata_, but the\r\nreticulations are bold and form indistinct bands on the hind limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 4.--COMPARISON OF FOUR CHARACTERS IN FIVE SAMPLES OF DIAGLENA.\r\n(ALL DATA ARE FOR MALES; MEANS GIVEN IN PARENTHESES BELOW RANGES.)\r\n\r\n+-----------------+---------+----------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n|                 |         |          |   Head   | Inter-  |Internarial|\r\n|                 |         |          |  width   | orbital | distance  |\r\n|                 | Number  |Snout-vent|          |distance |           |\r\n|    Locality     |   of    |  length  |----------+---------+-----------+\r\n|                 |specimens|          |Snout-vent|  Head   |   Head    |\r\n|                 |         |          |  length  |  width  |   width   |\r\n+-----------------+---------+----------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n|     Oaxaca      |    9    |71.1-87.5 |25.4-29.1 |63.0-71.4| 11.9-13.8 |\r\n|                 |         |  (80.7)  |  (27.9)  | (67.1)  |  (12.9)   |\r\n+-----------------+---------+----------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n|    Coast of     |    5    |72.0-79.2 |24.3-27.2 |67.0-73.8| 13.7-14.4 |\r\n|    Michoacan    |         |  (74.8)  |  (25.6)  | (71.4)  |  (14.1)   |\r\n+-----------------+---------+----------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n|     Colima      |    4    |71.7-79.6 |26.1-28.6 |70.5-75.3| 16.0-17.9 |\r\n|                 |         |  (74.8)  |  (27.4)  | (72.0)  |  (16.6)   |\r\n+-----------------+---------+----------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n|  Tepalcatepec   |    2    |63.0-65.4 |28.3-32.2 |57.3-62.4| 17.0-20.2 |\r\n|     Valley      |         |  (64.2)  |  (30.3)  | (59.9)  |  (18.6)   |\r\n+-----------------+---------+----------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n|     Sinaloa     |   11    |71.9-81.3 |24.0-27.3 |70.5-78.1| 15.0-17.3 |\r\n|                 |         |  (77.3)  |  (25.7)  | (73.4)  |  (16.1)   |\r\n+-----------------+---------+----------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n\r\nAll specimens from Michoacan and Colima more closely approach _Diaglena\r\nreticulata_ than _D. spatulata_. The acquisition of additional\r\nspecimens, especially from the area between Sinaloa and Colima and from\r\nGuerrero, is necessary to determine the relationships among the various\r\npopulations known at present. Both species of _Diaglena_ inhabit\r\ntropical scrub forest; none has been found in the more humid and\r\ntropical semi-deciduous forests. Humid forest replaces the scrub forest\r\nin the lowlands of southern Nayarit and northern Jalisco; possibly this\r\nforest acts as a barrier to the distribution of _Diaglena_ and thus\r\nserves as a divider between the ranges of _D. spatulata_ to the north\r\nand _D. reticulata_ to the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Pternohyla fodiens~ Boulenger\r\n\r\n     _Pternohyla fodiens_ Boulenger, Ann.

Calling\r\nmales were heard on rainy nights throughout the rainy season; in nearly\r\nevery instance both males and females were found in low trees and\r\nbushes. On summer nights when there had been no rain, adults were found\r\nsitting on bushes in the scrub forest.\r\n\r\nAt Coalcoman on July 1, 1955, a chorus was heard at midday. About forty\r\n_Phyllomedusa dacnicolor_ were found in one guayava bush at the edge of\r\na recently dried pond. Individual males were calling; clasping males\r\nwere silent. The call is a barking groan. Fifteen individual egg masses\r\nwere hanging from branches and leaves in tear-drop fashion. Each egg\r\nmass contained 100 to 350 pale green eggs, located only in the exterior\r\npart of the clear gelatinous mass. Two composite egg masses appeared to\r\nhave been made up by egg deposition on the part of three to five females\r\n(Pl. 2, Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nAs shown by Duellman (1957a), the characters used by Taylor (1952) to\r\ndiagnose _Phyllomedusa alcorni_ are sexually dimorphic.

In life there were olive-gray blotches on a pale gray dorsum;\r\nthe iris was a dark golden color.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is known from only a few specimens, seems to be\r\nrestricted to the coastal lowlands and low foothills from Guerrero\r\nnorthward to Nayarit. Shannon and Humphrey (1957) described _Phrynohyas\r\ncorasterias_ from Nayarit. Their description was based on a small female\r\nhaving a snout-vent length of 34.4 mm. The new species was diagnosed as\r\ndiffering from _P. inflata_ in having less webbing on the feet, a poorly\r\ndeveloped supratympanic fold, a more pustulate dorsum, and marked\r\ndifferences in dorsal pattern, color, and nature of antebrachial\r\nbanding. The significance of the webbing was questioned by Shannon and\r\nHumphrey. The nature of the supratympanic fold and dorsal pustules\r\nchanges with age (Duellman, 1956a:31). _Phrynohyas inflata_ is known to\r\nattain a snout-vent length of 95 mm. Dermal structures that undergo\r\nontogenetic change are of little importance in comparing a juvenile with\r\na large adult. The only significant difference in color pattern between\r\n_P. inflata_ and _P. corasterias_ is the presence of wide transverse\r\nbands on the limbs of the latter. In this respect _P. corasterias_\r\napproaches _P. latifasciata_, a species known only from two specimens\r\nfrom southern Sinaloa. The acquisition of additional specimens from\r\nJalisco, Nayarit, and Sinaloa may show that _P. inflata_ and _P.\r\nlatifasciata_ are conspecific, as suggested by Duellman (1956a:21).\r\nNonetheless, the specimen on which the description of _P. corasterias_\r\nwas based is not sufficiently different from the known specimens of _P.\r\ninflata_ to warrant specific recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hyla arenicolor~\r\n\r\n     _Hyla arenicolor_ Cope, Jour.

There is great disparity in size between specimens from\r\nthe mountains and those from the Tepalcatepec Valley. Seven males from\r\nelevations in excess of 1400 meters have an average snout-vent length of\r\n34.7 mm.; nine from elevations below 1000 meters have an average\r\nsnout-vent length of 49.1 mm. In life a male collected at night at\r\nLombardia (UMMZ 112846) had dark brown spots on a grayish brown dorsum;\r\nthe groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs, and ventral\r\nsurfaces of the hind limbs and palms were yellowish orange. The belly\r\nand tips of digits were white; the vocal sac was purplish brown, and the\r\niris was dark grayish gold. In contrast, a specimen obtained in the\r\ndaytime at Chinapa (UMMZ 119204) had indistinct gray spots on a pale\r\nashy gray dorsum; the flash colors were yellow. After dark the spots\r\nwere dark olive-brown on a grayish brown dorsum.\r\n\r\nTwo males were found calling from a rocky stream near Lombardia on July\r\n12, 1955. The call is a nasal \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hyla baudini~ Dumeril and Bibron\r\n\r\n     _Hyla baudinii_ Dumeril and Bibron, Erpetologie generale,\r\n     vol. 8:564, 1841.--Mexico.

Notes on the color of a\r\nliving frog from Dos Aguas (UMMZ 119193) are: Dorsal ground color a\r\nmedium shade of brown with dark brown flecks; flanks black with silvery\r\nwhite and pale yellow spots; belly pale yellowish white; throat mottled\r\nwith grayish brown; iris pale copper color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Tadpole of _Hyla bistincta_ (UMMZ 115231) from\r\nUruapan, Michoacan. x 2.]\r\n\r\nDescription of Tadpole: Body somewhat depressed; maximum width of body\r\nslightly more than one-half of body length. Nostrils placed\r\ndorsolaterally and directed anteriorly, situated about midway between\r\ntip of snout and eye. Eyes of moderate size, dorsolateral in position\r\nand directed upwards. Tail about twice as long as body, thrice as long\r\nas deep, and tapering gradually to a rounded tip. Tail-musculature not\r\nextending to tip of tail fin. Spiracle sinistral, lateral, and situated\r\nat midbody. Vent dextral; the cloacal tube extending along ventral part\r\nof tail for a distance equal to about one-eighth of body length (Fig.\r\n8). Average body length of six tadpoles with small hind limb buds, 19.5\r\nmm.; tail length, 38.3 mm. Mouth ventral, its width equal to about\r\ntwo-thirds of greatest width of body. Lips bordered by two rows of small\r\npapillae; row of larger papillae between upper lip and outer upper\r\ntooth-row, similar row between lower lip and outer lower tooth-row;\r\nlaterally these rows degenerating into numerous small papillae. Horny\r\nbeaks well developed; upper beak moderately arched and deeply indented;\r\nlower beak slightly indented. Serrations of beaks blunt and peglike,\r\nmoderately developed on both beaks, but slightly stronger on lower one.\r\nTooth-rows 2/3; upper rows nearly equal in length and slightly longer\r\nthan lower rows, which are subequal in length; inner upper tooth row\r\ninterrupted medially by rounded notch; inner lower tooth-row turned\r\ndownward laterally; teeth in all rows about equal in size, but\r\ndecreasing in length laterally (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.

Some specimens\r\nfrom the western part of Michoacan possess certain characters used by\r\nMaslin (1957:81) to distinguish _Hyla microeximia_ from _H. eximia_;\r\nnevertheless, the variation is such that two species cannot be\r\ndistinguished in Michoacan. Four series of freshly preserved specimens\r\nhave been studied in detail; in the discussion below they are arranged\r\nfrom west to east; the measurement is for snout-vent length of ten males\r\nfrom each sample:\r\n\r\n     _Zamora._--Twenty-two specimens (UMMZ 102083), 24.0-27.6\r\n     (26.1) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe, or row of dashes,\r\n     present in all specimens; dark spots in lateral and dorsal\r\n     green fields; lateral dark stripe confluent with\r\n     dorsolateral stripe posteriorly in 18 specimens; white line\r\n     not extending to groin.\r\n\r\n     _Temazcal._--Thirty-five specimens (UMMZ 119162), 26.5-31.1\r\n     (28.2) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe of row of spots present\r\n     only posteriorly in most; both dorsolateral stripes and\r\n     dorsal spots lacking in four specimens; heavy spotting\r\n     dorsally in three others; lateral and dorsolateral dark\r\n     stripes confluent posteriorly in three; lateral white stripe\r\n     extending to groin in 16 specimens.\r\n\r\n     _Ciudad Hidalgo._--Thirty-six specimens (UMMZ 119163),\r\n     26.4-30.9 (28.2) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe or row of\r\n     spots present only posteriorly in most; no brown spots in\r\n     the green fields of many specimens; large brown inguinal\r\n     spot in most specimens; heavy spotting dorsally in four;\r\n     lateral and dorsolateral dark stripes confluent posteriorly\r\n     in five; lateral white line extending to groin in most\r\n     specimens.\r\n\r\n     _Tuxpan._--Fifteen specimens (UMMZ 115227), 28.7-33.0 (30.5)\r\n     mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe or row of dashes in all\r\n     specimens; dark spots in lateral green fields, at least\r\n     posteriorly in most; dark spots posteriorly in the dorsal\r\n     green field in five; lateral dark stripe separated from\r\n     dorsolateral stripe in all specimens; lateral white line\r\n     extends to the groin in all specimens.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the above descriptions, the distinguishing\r\ncharacters of _Hyla microeximia_--confluence of lateral and dorsolateral\r\ndark stripes posteriorly, extent of lateral white stripe, and\r\ndistribution of dark spots dorsally--are found in individuals from all\r\nof the populations sampled. In the samples from western Michoacan there\r\nis a higher incidence of _microeximia_-like frogs than in those from\r\nother parts of the state. _Hyla eximia_ is a wide-ranging species\r\nvarying greatly geographically and individually. A thorough review of\r\nthe species and related members of the _Hyla eximia_-group is necessary\r\nbefore certain populations can justifiably be segregated as subspecies\r\nor species.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan _Hyla eximia_ has been collected in mesquite-grassland,\r\npine-oak forest, and cultivated areas on the Mexican Plateau from 1500\r\nto 2300 meters; apparently it is absent from the Sierra de Coalcoman.\r\nThis is the most abundant frog on the southern part of the Mexican\r\nPlateau; in the rainy season breeding choruses are found in temporary\r\npools and in the marshes adjacent to the permanent lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hyla lafrentzi~ Mertens and Wolterstorff\r\n\r\n     _Hyla lafrentzi_ Mertens and Wolterstorff, Zool.

Peters collected this species at elevations of\r\n2400 to 2800 meters on the west slope of Cerro San Andres. The frogs\r\nwere found beneath logs and rocks in a damp canyon in coniferous forest.\r\nAmong the juveniles in this series is a completely transformed\r\nindividual (UMMZ 102093) having a snout-vent length of 14.5 mm. Five\r\nadults have snout-vent lengths of 36.2-39.5 (38.0) mm. _Hyla lafrentzi_\r\nhas noticeably longer hind limbs than _H. eximia_; in the former, when\r\nthe hind limb is brought forward along the body, the tibiotarsal\r\narticulation extends to the snout. There are dark transverse bands on\r\nthe hind limbs; the dorsolateral stripe is broken into an anterior and a\r\nposterior segment, and the latter is narrowly bordered by white in most\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n_Hyla lafrentzi_ occurs at higher elevations than any other frog in\r\nMichoacan; the locality records from throughout the range indicate that\r\nit is restricted to pine and pine-fir forests. In these habitats it\r\nreplaces _Hyla eximia_, which inhabits the lower pine-oak forests and\r\nmesquite-grassland on the Mexican Plateau. Ponds are absent at places\r\nwhere _Hyla lafrentzi_ has been collected; possibly the eggs are laid in\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hyla smaragdina~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Hyla smaragdina_ Taylor, Copeia, No. 1:18, March 30,\r\n     1940.--6 kilometers east of Cojumatlan, Michoacan, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     _Hylella azteca_ Taylor, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 56:49,\r\n     June 16, 1943.--Tepoztlan, Morelos, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Cojumatlan (30); Copuyo (7); 18 km. E of Dos Aguas (22);\r\n     Ostula (8); Pomaro (3); Sahuayo; Salitre de Estopilas (7).\r\n\r\nTaylor (1940a:18) diagnosed this species as having few or no vomerine\r\nteeth, no vocal sac, a rather broad and flat head, two large tubercles\r\nbelow the anus, a granular venter, and a green dorsum in life. The\r\nspecimens on which the description was based are either immature or\r\nnon-breeding individuals; all were collected from bromeliads growing on\r\ncacti near Cojumatlan. Another small, flat-headed hylid from Tepoztlan,\r\nMorelos, was described and diagnosed by Taylor (1943b:49) as differing\r\nfrom _Hyla smaragdina_ in having a vocal sac and a broader head. This\r\nspecimen was named _Hylella azteca_. Specimens from the coastal region\r\nof Michoacan and Colima were referred to _Hylella azteca_ by Peters\r\n(1954:7) and Duellman (1958c:8).\r\n\r\nComparison of topotypic _Hyla smaragdina_ and the holotype of _Hylella\r\nazteca_ (UIMNH 25044) with the several series of specimens from\r\nMichoacan has resulted in the conclusion that all pertain to only one\r\nspecies. Although the type series of _Hyla smaragdina_ consists of\r\nimmature specimens, the males in that series do possess vocal sacs.\r\nSince these were not breeding individuals, the sacs are not well\r\ndeveloped. The characters of the anal tubercles and the relative width\r\nof the head are of no value in separating the two species. The\r\napparently aestivating individuals comprising the type series of _Hyla\r\nsmaragdina_, and the type of _Hylella azteca_, which also was found in a\r\nbromeliad, were green in life. Of the calling males found on the coast\r\nof Michoacan, most were yellowish tan when found; two were pale green,\r\nbut soon changed to pale tan. Calling males from Copuyo and Dos Aguas\r\nwere pale yellowish tan. Therefore the color of the dorsum is of little\r\nsignificance in distinguishing the two named populations.\r\n\r\nMales of _Hyla smaragdina_ have been found calling in the months of June\r\nand July from rocky streams; the call is a nasal \"haah-haah-haah,\"\r\nrepeated quickly and constantly for as long as 30 seconds. As pointed\r\nout by Duellman (1958c:9), this breeding behavior is unlike that\r\nsuggested by Taylor (1943b:51). In Michoacan _Hyla smaragdina_ has been\r\nfound in tropical semi-deciduous forest, oak forest, and\r\nmesquite-grassland at elevations from 150 to 1500 meters.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hyla smithi~ Boulenger\r\n\r\n     _Hyla smithi_ Boulenger, Zool.

The call consists of a series of short, high notes,\r\nsomewhat reminiscent of a katydid's song. In the dry season occasional\r\nmales were heard calling from irrigated fields near Apatzingan. In the\r\ndaytime individuals were found in the axils of leaves of the\r\nelephant-ear plants (_Xanthosoma_).\r\n\r\nIn living individuals the dorsal color usually is uniform pale yellow;\r\noften the lateral white stripe is barely visible. The vocal sac is\r\nbright yellow, and the iris is pale gold. In some individuals there are\r\nscattered dark brown spots or flecks on the back and upper surfaces of\r\nlimbs. Twenty males from Apatzingan have the following measurements:\r\nsnout-vent length, 22.8-26.0 (25.0) mm., tibia length, 10.7-13.6 (12.6)\r\nmm.; head width, 7.2-8.0 (7.6) mm., head length, 7.1-8.1 (7.7) mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hypopachus caprimimus~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Hypopachus caprimimus_ Taylor, Univ.

Eleven specimens\r\nfrom the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau all have the flanks darker\r\nthan the dorsum, a distinct and continuous dark stripe from the occiput\r\nto the groin, a large dark spot in the inguinal region, and a pair of\r\ndark transverse stripes on the thigh and shank (Pl. 6, Fig. 1). With\r\nthe exception of three specimens from Charapendo, all have a\r\npredominantly brown venter with round, cream-colored spots.\r\n\r\nPeters (1954:8) referred specimens from Buena Vista and San Salvador to\r\n_Hypopachus oxyrrhinus_. He stated that the specimen (BMNH\r\n1914.1.28.150) from San Salvador had flanks much darker than the dorsum\r\nand a well-defined continuous stripe from the occiput to the groin; this\r\nspecimen has the characters of _H. caprimimus_. The specimen (BMNH\r\n1914.1.28.151) from Buena Vista resembles _H. oxyrrhinus_ in some\r\ncharacters, but it is not like _H. oxyrrhinus ovis_ on the Mexican\r\nPlateau in Michoacan. The specimen has paired transverse stripes on the\r\nhind limbs as does _H. caprimimus_, and is here referred to that\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan this species has been collected in arid tropical scrub\r\nforest at elevations of 200 to 1800 meters in the northern foothills of\r\nthe Sierra de Coalcoman, the Tepalcatepec and Tuxpan valleys, and on the\r\nlower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica.

With the exception of one specimen from\r\nTangamandapio, all have dark bellies extensively mottled or spotted with\r\ncream-color. Most of the specimens have some form of an irregular,\r\nusually broken, dark line from the occiput to the groin. In eight\r\nspecimens there is no line or linear arrangement of spots; instead the\r\ndorsum is spotted or flecked with dark brown. The ground color of the\r\ndorsum and flanks varies from dull reddish brown to grayish brown;\r\ncream-colored spots are evident on the flanks and posterior surfaces of\r\nthe thighs in all specimens (Pl. 6, Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nIn comparison with 14 specimens from Queseria, Colima (UMMZ 80001-2),\r\nindividuals from the Mexican Plateau have a darker venter with bolder\r\nmarkings, and a more mottled dorsum.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan this species has been taken between 1500 and 2200 meters on\r\nthe Mexican Plateau, where it inhabits mesquite-grassland and cultivated\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Rana dunni~ Zweifel\r\n\r\n     _Rana dunni_ Zweifel, Copeia, no. 2:78, July 15, 1957.--Lago\r\n     de Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Lago de Patzcuaro (23); Rio de Morelia, near Undameo (8).\r\n\r\nAside from the type series of this species, there are in the Museum of\r\nZoology at the University of Michigan six specimens taken from \"tanks\"\r\nat the limnological station at Patzcuaro by Paul S.

Laying\r\nfemales and fresh nests were found on August 6-12, 1950, July 14-16,\r\n1951, and July 8-10, 1955. The general account of sea turtles on the\r\ncoast of Michoacan that was given by Peters (1957) is supplemented here\r\nby my field notes on the actions of one female observed on the night of\r\nJuly 14, 1951, near Maruata by Donald D. Brand and I. Because of a full\r\nmoon, visibility was excellent.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day several _Chelonia_ were seen in the surf;\r\nshortly after dark the first turtle was observed on the beach. Several\r\nwere observed to come out on the beach and crawl nearly to the strand\r\nline, only to return to the sea.\r\n\r\nAt 10:20 p. m. one turtle was seen about 15 meters from the water. We\r\nwatched this turtle from some distance and observed that by 10:26 p. m.\r\nshe had moved about ten meters to a bank of sand about two meters high.\r\nTen minutes later she had climbed the bank and disappeared over the top\r\ninto the brush. We moved closer and remained hidden below the bank.\r\nAlthough we could not see the turtle, we could hear her movements.\r\nBetween 10:37 and 10:57 p. m. the turtle dug, often flipping the dry\r\nsand for a distance of about two meters. When this energetic digging\r\nceased, we moved up the bank to see that she was facing inland and\r\nsitting in a depression about one and one-half meters in diameter and 30\r\ncentimeters in depth. She had cleaned out this depression in the past 20\r\nminutes. Between 11:00 and 11:36 p. m. she dug the nest hole by first\r\nscooping sand with one hind flipper and then with the other; when sand\r\nwas thrown by one flipper, there was a similar, but weaker, motion by\r\nthe other flipper. At 11:36 p. m. she stopped digging. By crawling up\r\nbehind the turtle we were able to examine the nest cavity, which\r\nmeasured 21 centimeters across the top and 38 centimeters deep. The\r\ndiameter of the bottom of the hole was estimated to be about 50\r\ncentimeters. At 11:40 p. m. she released the first egg; a minute later\r\nshe dropped the second. At 11:42 p. m. the third and fourth eggs were\r\nreleased; these were coherent, as were the fifth and sixth eggs released\r\nat 11:43 p. m. After this, as many as three eggs were dropped at a\r\ntime. After laying about 60 eggs, she paused for a minute and then\r\ncontinued laying. By 11:55 p. m. she had laid 98 eggs; after this, the\r\nprocess of deposition slowed considerably. She dropped a fragment of an\r\negg followed by normal eggs. At midnight she deposited a miniature egg\r\nabout 20 mm. in diameter. This terminated the deposition. Immediately\r\nshe began to cover the nest.\r\n\r\nWithin ten minutes after the last egg was deposited the nest had been\r\ncovered. The turtle first had been seen at 10:20 p. m.; judging from its\r\nspeed and its distance from the water, the turtle probably had been on\r\nland for about ten minutes. About 25 minutes were used in crawling from\r\nthe water to the nesting site. One hour and 33 minutes were spent at the\r\nnesting site; of this time twenty minutes were taken for egg deposition.\r\nThe turtle was not followed back to the water, but if the return trip\r\ntook approximately the same amount of time as required to travel from\r\nthe ocean to the nesting site, the total elapsed time from departure to\r\nreturn to the water was about two and one-half hours.\r\n\r\nWe collected the eggs as they were deposited. There were 106 eggs, each\r\nhaving a diameter of about 40 mm., plus one small egg and a fragment of\r\nanother. The turtle had a carapace about one meter in length.\r\n\r\nFrom our limited observations of sea turtles and their tracks on the\r\nbeaches, and from the accounts of these animals by the residents of the\r\ncoastal region, great numbers of sea turtles use these relatively\r\nuninhabited beaches for nesting grounds. However, the turtles do not go\r\nunmolested. The natives capture turtles and collect their eggs. Opened\r\nand emptied nests also showed signs of predatory activity on the part of\r\nother mammals. In the vicinity of Playa Azul several turtles were killed\r\nby dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Kinosternon hirtipes hirtipes~ Wagler\r\n\r\n     _Cinosternon hirtipes_ Wagler, Naturl. Syst.

Specimens have been collected in tropical\r\nsemi-deciduous forest at Ostula and in oak forest south of Arteaga; both\r\nof these localities are on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra de\r\nCoalcoman, a region inhabited by _Phyllodactylus homolepidurus_.

S of Arteaga.\r\n\r\nThree females from Arteaga (UMMZ 119075) have snout-vent lengths of 41,\r\n41, and 44 mm. In life the pale grayish brown dorsum was marked with\r\ndark brown; the belly was white, and the throat was pale pink. All have\r\na dark interorbital bar and dark vertical bars on the upper labials. In\r\ntwo specimens there are only scattered dark flecks on the dorsum; in the\r\nthird there is a dark postorbital stripe, a dark lateral stripe, and\r\nfour narrow transverse bands on the body. A male from 19 kilometers\r\nsouth of Arteaga (UMMZ 119076) having a snout-vent length of 49 mm. had\r\nin life a tan dorsum, a broad white stripe from the ear to the groin,\r\nscattered small white spots on the dorsum, and indistinct pale\r\ncream-colored spots on the posterior surfaces of the thighs. This male\r\nhas the dark labial bars, but lacks the dark interorbital bar, found in\r\nthe females. The large rose-pink throat fan extends to about the middle\r\nof the belly. In all of the specimens the middorsal scales are keeled\r\nand much smaller than the smooth pavementlike or slightly imbricate\r\nventrals. All have two gulars in contact with the mental, five scales\r\nbetween the nasals, five scales (not including the first labials) in\r\ncontact with the rostral, and four rows of loreals. In these characters\r\nthese specimens agree well with _Anolis dunni_ from Guerrero, as\r\ndiagnosed by Davis (1954b).\r\n\r\nPreviously _Anolis dunni_ has been reported only from the vicinity of\r\nAgua del Obispo, Guerrero, a locality situated at an elevation of about\r\n900 meters in pine-oak forest in the Sierra del Sur.

Boulenger (1885:77) used the\r\nsame characters; Smith and Taylor (1950b:58) in their key to the Mexican\r\nspecies of _Anolis_ stated that the dorsal scales are slightly smaller\r\nthan the ventrals in _A. nebulosus_ and markedly smaller in _A.\r\nnebuloides_. Smith (_in litt._) stated that the characters of the\r\nrelative sizes of the dorsal and ventral scales were incorrect in that\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nThe application of the above criteria to specimens from Michoacan has\r\nnot resulted in the recognition of two species. The majority of the\r\nspecimens have the supraorbital semicircles separated by at least one\r\nsmall scale; the head scales, with the exception of those on the snout\r\nin a few individuals, are smooth; the dorsal scales are only slightly\r\nsmaller than the ventrals. In other characters of scutellation the\r\nspecimens are highly variable. The males in life have an orange throat\r\nfan. Anoles of this kind have been found in Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco,\r\nNayarit, and southern Sinaloa. Near Oaxaca, Oaxaca, specimens were\r\ncollected that superficially resemble those from Michoacan and farther\r\nnorth. These have low keels on the snout scales, dorsals somewhat larger\r\nthan the ventrals, and a pink throat fan. In ten males from Oaxaca the\r\nsize of the dorsal scales relative to that of the ventrals is 1.00:0.83;\r\nthe same ratio for 25 males from Michoacan is 1.00:1.08. In both samples\r\nthere are specimens in which the dorsal and ventral scales are about\r\nequal in size.\r\n\r\nInvestigations by Richard E. Etheridge on the osteology of _Anolis_,\r\nincluding those species here being considered, have revealed relatively\r\nconstant differences in the parasternalia and in the caudal vertebrae.\r\nThe application of Etheridge's findings to anoline systematics must\r\nawait the completion of his study.\r\n\r\nThe carination of the scales on the snout _versus_ smooth scales there\r\nseems to be the only significant character given by Bocourt that\r\ndistinguishes _A. Nebuloides_ from _A. nebulosus_. The difference in the\r\ncolor of the throat fan, which is apparent only in living individuals,\r\nis more striking. Obviously more than one species is represented, as is\r\nborne out by the differences in the color of the throat fan and in the\r\nosteology, but there is uncertainty about the correct name for each\r\nspecies. On the strength of Bocourt's diagnosis of keeled snout scales\r\nin _A. nebuloides_, I am applying that name to the population in Oaxaca\r\nand _A. nebulosus_ to the specimens from Michoacan. As arranged here,\r\nthe two species can be distinguished, as follows:\r\n\r\n     _A. nebulosus._--Dorsal scales only slightly smaller than\r\n     the ventral scales; snout scales usually smooth; throat-fan\r\n     bright orange in adult males.\r\n\r\n     _A. nebuloides._--Dorsal scales somewhat larger than the\r\n     ventral scales; snout scales having a low keel; throat-fan\r\n     pink in adult males.\r\n\r\nWith respect to geographic distribution, _A. nebulosus_ has been\r\ncollected from southern Sinaloa southward to Michoacan. The lizards here\r\nreferred to _A. nebuloides_ have been taken only in pine-oak forest on\r\nthe mountain slopes near Oaxaca City. Zweifel and Norris (1955:233)\r\nreported anoles with pink throat-fans from southern Sonora; possibly\r\nthose specimens are _A. nebuloides_; I have not examined them. I have\r\nseen several preserved specimens from the vicinity of Tehuantepec,\r\nOaxaca. Although they probably belong to this group, those specimens\r\ndiffer from both _A. nebulosus_ and _A. nebuloides_ in their larger\r\nsize, relatively larger head, and much larger throat fan.\r\n\r\nAside from the minor variation in scutellation, specimens of _Anolis\r\nnebulosus_ from Michoacan vary greatly in coloration. Usually the\r\nfemales have some form of a broad middorsal pale-colored band. In life\r\nthis is dull yellow, tan, or orange. Two females from Dos Aguas are\r\nstrikingly different; one (UMMZ 119521) has a broad middorsal orange\r\nstripe that is scalloped laterally and bordered by gray. The other (UMMZ\r\n119081) has a narrow middorsal cream-colored line. Males usually are\r\nunicolor brown or olive-tan; sometimes the middorsal region is darker.\r\nSome individuals have dark cross-bands or chevrons on the dorsum. One\r\nmale from Dos Aguas (UMMZ 119080) has a cream-colored lateral stripe.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan _Anolis nebulosus_ occurs from sea level to elevations\r\nslightly in excess of 2100 meters, usually in areas of dense cover,\r\nwhether this be herbaceous, viney, or woody, ordinarily on the ground as\r\nwell as in bushes and trees. One was in a bromeliad growing about ten\r\nmeters above the ground. In the arid Tepalcatepec Valley anoles of this\r\nspecies are most frequently found in the tangled growth along streams.\r\nAbove Uruapan they were found in pine-oak forest, and on the Mexican\r\nPlateau between Zamora and Zacapu they were found in a bunch grass-scrub\r\noak association.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Anolis schmidti~ Smith\r\n\r\n     _Anolis schmidti_ Smith, Publ.

The record from Uruapan (USNM 10234, collected by Duges) is\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nThese large lizards are most easily observed on rock fences along roads.\r\nNear Apatzingan innumerable individuals can be seen in mid-morning.\r\nLater in the day, as the sun rises higher in the sky, the lizards\r\nretreat to the shade of the crevices in the fences. The abundance of\r\nthese lizards in the Tepalcatepec Valley, together with evidence\r\ngathered from the natives of the valley, indicates that these lizards\r\nare seldom used for human consumption there. On the other hand, several\r\npeople in Coalcoman consider the \"iguana negra\" (local name for\r\n_Ctenosaura_) to be a delicacy and serve it at every opportunity. In\r\nearly July, 1951, brilliant green young of the year were collected at La\r\nPlaya and at Coalcoman.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Enyaliosaurus clarki~ (Bailey)\r\n\r\n     _Ctenosaura clarki_ Bailey, Proc. U.

Apparently the lizard is absent from the coastal\r\nlowlands of Michoacan and Guerrero. The distribution of this species,\r\ntherefore, is discontinuous.

It seems to prefer\r\nrather open coniferous forests in which there is a more or less\r\ncontinuous cover of grasses on the ground. On warm sunny days the\r\nlizards can be observed scurrying about in the grass; in the early hours\r\nof the day, or on cold days, they are found beneath stones, logs, or\r\ndead clumps of bunch grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Sceloporus asper~ Boulenger\r\n\r\n     _Sceloporus asper_ Boulenger, Proc.

The lizards are exceedingly wary and can be\r\napproached only with difficulty. In life males have pale blue bellies;\r\nthe throat is pale pink. The pale gray dorsum marked with irregular\r\ndarker gray blotches blends well with the color of the tree trunks on\r\nwhich the lizard lives.

NE of Dos Aguas (5).\r\n\r\nHeretofore this species has been known only from a few specimens from\r\nscattered localities in the Sierra Madre Occidental in southwestern\r\nJalisco and Sinaloa. The collection of a large series of these lizards\r\nin virgin pine forest at elevations of more than 2000 meters in the\r\nSierra de Coalcoman now makes possible an analysis of variation in the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nSuperficially _S. bulleri_ resembles _S. torquatus_, but _S. bulleri_ is\r\nsmaller, has more dorsal scales, fewer scales in the dark collar, and\r\nfewer femoral pores. In 88 specimens of _S. bulleri_ there are 36-41\r\n(38.7) dorsal scales and 2 or 3 (2.6) middorsal scales in the collar, as\r\ncompared with 28-31 (29.3) dorsal scales and 3 or 4 (3.4) middorsal\r\nscales in the collar of 26 specimens of _S. torquatus_ from Uruapan. In\r\n20 adult males of _S. bulleri_ there are 13-15 (14.3) femoral pores, and\r\n13-16 (14.4) in 11 females; 13 males of _S. torquatus_ have 14-21 (17.3)\r\nfemoral pores, and 13 females have 15-21 (16.7). Seventeen adult males\r\nof _S. bulleri_ have snout-vent lengths of 72-91 (82.0); ten females,\r\n71-87 (75.7). In comparison, 13 adult males of _S. torquatus_ have an\r\naverage snout-vent length of 88.9 mm., and 13 females, 88.5 mm. In _S.\r\nbulleri_ there is little variation in the head scales. The frontal is in\r\ncontact with the interparietal in 63, and not in 24, specimens; the\r\nmedian frontonasal is in contact with the frontal in 13, and not in 74,\r\nspecimens. In 39 specimens there are two canthals, and in 48 there is\r\none; in 29 specimens there are three preauriculars, and in 58 there are\r\nfour.\r\n\r\nIn life adult males have a pale blue tail, bright blue belly patches, a\r\npurplish blue throat, and pale blue lines on the sides of the head and\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nThis species was obtained at four localities in the high mountains of\r\nthe Sierra de Coalcoman. In this mountain range _Sceloporus bulleri_\r\napparently replaces _S. torquatus_, a species that is widespread in the\r\nCordillera Volcanica and on the Mexican Plateau. At Dos Aguas and at\r\nAcuaro de las Lleguas the lizards were abundant in the tall pine forest,\r\nwhere they were found on standing pine trees, on pine logs, and on rock\r\noutcroppings.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Sceloporus dugesi intermedius~ Duges\r\n\r\n     _Sceloporus intermedius_ Duges, La Naturaleza, 4:29,\r\n     1877.--La Noria, near Zamora, Michoacan, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     _Sceloporus dugesii intermedius_, Smith, Univ.

It is a terrestrial species, and is\r\nmost often seen on rock fences at elevations of 1500 to 2200 meters.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from _S. bulleri_ and _S. torquatus_ in having two\r\nrows of supraoculars, instead of one; also it has more dorsal scales.\r\nTwenty-six specimens of _Sceloporus dugesi intermedius_ from\r\nTangamandapio and Tangancicuaro have 44-48 (45.7) dorsal scales, as\r\ncompared with an average of 38.7 in _S. bulleri_ and 29.3 in _S.\r\ntorquatus_. In life _Sceloporus dugesi intermedius_ has a dull greenish\r\ngray dorsum; in males the belly patches are bright blue bordered\r\nmedially by black, and the throat is bluish gray. The largest specimen\r\nexamined is a male having a snout-vent length of 80 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Sceloporus gadowae~ Boulenger\r\n\r\n     _Sceloporus gadoviae_ Boulenger, Proc. Zool. Soc.

S\r\n     of Lombardia (11).\r\n\r\nAlthough this species has a rather extensive range in the\r\nBalsas-Tepalcatepec Basin in the state of Michoacan, Guerrero, Morelos,\r\nand Puebla, it is only locally abundant in that area. Usually these\r\nlizards are found on rocky cliffs in which there are many crevices for\r\ncover. _Sceloporus gadowae_ is abundant on a conglomerate cliff along\r\nthe Rio Marquez south of Lombardia. Although the closely related _S.\r\npyrocephalus_ is abundant in the stream valley and in the hills above\r\nthe cliff, _S. gadowae_ has been found only on the cliff; few\r\nindividuals of _S. pyrocephalus_ have been observed on the cliff. A\r\nsimilar situation was discovered on a much more extensive conglomerate\r\ncliff along the Rio Balsas near Mexcala, Guerrero. Near Tehuitzingo,\r\nPuebla, where _S. pyrocephalus_ was not found, _S. gadowae_ was found on\r\nconglomerate cliffs. Probably there is strong competition between the\r\ntwo species; possibly this has resulted in the restriction of _S.\r\ngadowae_ to isolated cliff-habitats within the extensive range of the\r\nmore widespread _S. pyrocephalus_.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan _Sceloporus gadowae_ has been found along the lower slopes\r\nof the Cordillera Volcanica at elevations from 250 to 1050 meters. All\r\nof the localities from which this lizard is known lie in the arid\r\ntropical scrub forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Sceloporus grammicus microlepidotus~ Wiegmann\r\n\r\n     _Sceloporus microlepidotus_ Wiegmann, Herpetologia Mexicana,\r\n     p. 51, 1834.--Mexico.

The description of _S. heterolepis_\r\ngiven by Smith (1939:197) can be supplemented by data on the 23\r\nspecimens now in the collections of the Museum of Zoology at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan. All have two canthals; there are 55 to 71 (63.6)\r\nscales in the middorsal row; 1 to 3 rows middorsally are somewhat\r\nenlarged and bordered on either side by a row of larger scales bearing\r\nhigh keels. There are 14 to 20 (16.2) femoral pores. Eight adult males\r\nhave snout-vent lengths from 49 to 61 (58.0) mm. and tail lengths from\r\n57 to 74 (66.0) mm.; four adult females have snout-vent lengths from 52\r\nto 57 (55.2) mm. and tail lengths from 60 to 66 (63.5) mm. The smallest\r\nof eight juveniles has a snout-vent length of 28 mm. and a tail length\r\nof 32 mm. The dorsum in adults is pale grayish brown; there are three\r\nirregular chevron-shaped dark marks and a triangular dark brown mark\r\nabove the insertion of the hind limbs; on the tail are dark brown rings.\r\nThere are scattered faint blue flecks on the flanks and narrow\r\ntransverse dark lines on the lower limbs. Males have pale bluish green\r\nbelly patches and an orange-salmon-colored throat; the belly in females\r\nis pale orange-tan. The juveniles have a more contrasting color pattern;\r\nthe dark chevrons on the dorsum are bordered posteriorly by pale gray.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan this species has been obtained in pine and pine-fir forests\r\nfrom 1800 to 2700 meters. On Cerro Barolosa and at Dos Aguas, both in\r\nthe Sierra de Coalcoman, the lizards were found beneath the bark of\r\ndead, standing pines. In the Sierra de Coalcoman _Sceloporus\r\nheterolepis_ seems to fill the niche of the small arboreal _Sceloporus_\r\nin the coniferous forest in southwestern Mexico, a position held by _S.\r\ngrammicus microlepidotus_ in the Cordillera Volcanica; the latter\r\nspecies does not occur in the Sierra de Coalcoman. Five specimens of\r\n_Sceloporus heterolepis_ are known from the Cordillera Volcanica,\r\nwhereas 603 of _S. grammicus microlepidotus_ have been collected there.\r\nThe ecological relationships that exist between the two species in the\r\nCordillera Volcanica are not known.\r\n\r\nInsofar as is known, _Sceloporus heterolepis_ reaches the southern\r\nlimits of its range in the Sierra de Coalcoman and in the western part\r\nof the Cordillera Volcanica. Other records for the species are from the\r\nSierra Madre Occidental in Jalisco. Langebartel (1959) described\r\n_Sceloporus shannonorum_ from the mountains near the Durango-Sinaloa\r\nborder; the single specimen of _S. shannonorum_ differs significantly\r\nfrom _S. heterolepis_ only in having fewer dorsal scales (48). The\r\nacquisition of additional material, especially from Nayarit and northern\r\nJalisco, probably will provide a basis for showing that these two\r\npopulations are conspecific.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Sceloporus horridus oligoporus~ Cope\r\n\r\n     _Sceloporus oligoporus_ Cope, Proc.

Examination of forty specimens from the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley and the coastal regions of Michoacan does not\r\nsubstantiate this diagnosis. The number of femoral pores varies from 15\r\nto 22 (18.9); 14 individuals (35%) had 20 or more femoral pores. Smith\r\n(_loc. cit._) stated that _S. melanorhinus_ in Oaxaca had 18 to 27\r\n(21.6) femoral pores and that 77 per cent of the specimens had more than\r\n20 femoral pores. Of the 24 males examined from Michoacan, 18 have the\r\nlateral belly patches separated in the midline. Usually they are\r\nseparated by no more than one scale, but in some individuals they are\r\nseparated by two or more scales. Although the above data minimize\r\ncertain differences between the northern and southern populations of\r\nthis species, certain of the color pattern characters seem to be\r\ndiagnostic of the subspecies inhabiting the Pacific lowlands from\r\nGuerrero to Nayarit. Large adults of _S. m. calligaster_ have only a\r\nfaint dorsal pattern, which in the subspecies _melanorhinus_ and\r\n_stuarti_ consists of a series of large, dark, interconnected triangles\r\non the back. This pattern is present in young and small adults of _S. m.\r\ncalligaster_; furthermore, in this subspecies the ventral coloration of\r\nthe males differs from that found in the more southern populations.\r\nAdult males of _S. m. calligaster_ have a black throat, that changes to\r\nbrilliant blue posteriorly, and a large white spot medially on the chin.\r\nThis spot is present in some specimens from Oaxaca and Chiapas, but, if\r\npresent, it is much smaller and less distinct than in specimens from\r\nMichoacan. In _S. m. calligaster_ the chest and midventral area are\r\norange to salmon-color.\r\n\r\nA male from Lombardia in life was colored as follows: Dorsum grayish tan\r\nbearing faint bluish gray flecks; chest deep salmon-orange, this color\r\ncontinuing down midventral area to the somewhat paler groin; belly\r\npatches pale blue fading to pale green laterally; throat black\r\nanteriorly enclosing a white spot; throat blue posteriorly and bluish\r\ngreen posterolaterally.\r\n\r\nIndividual lizards were observed to change in dorsal color from a pale\r\nashy gray to a rather dull brown. Normally, inactive individuals and\r\nthose observed on overcast days were dull brown.\r\n\r\n_Sceloporus melanorhinus calligaster_ is found in trees in riparian\r\nsituations in the lowlands to elevations of about 1500 meters. It does\r\nnot inhabit the arid tropical scrub forest in the Tepalcatepec Valley or\r\non the coast, but in those areas is found in the gallery forests along\r\nstreams and rivers. The lizards are wary and live high in the trees;\r\nthey are especially difficult to locate in the rainy season, when the\r\ntrees are in full leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Sceloporus pyrocephalus~ Cope\r\n\r\n     _Sceloporus pyrocephalus_ Cope, Proc.

Altitudinally, it ranges from sea level to\r\nslightly more than 1000 meters. The sexes are readily distinguished in\r\nthe field (Oliver, 1937; Smith, 1939; Duellman, 1954b).

In many places it is almost entirely arboreal, but in\r\nareas where there are many fallen trees or rock fences and rock piles,\r\nmany individuals have been found on the ground near the rocks or logs.\r\nIn the coniferous forests this species is associated with _S. grammicus\r\nmicrotepidotus_ and _S. aeneus aeneus_.\r\n\r\nThe distinction made by Smith (1938:572) between the subspecies _S.\r\ntorquatus torquatus_ and _melanogaster_ is slight.

Tupataro; Uruapan (12); Tzitzio; Zamora.\r\n\r\nThe known distribution and geographic variation of _Urosaurus\r\nbicarinatus_ in southwestern Mexico presents a confused picture. In\r\ngeneral rugosity, specimens from the coastal region of Michoacan\r\n(Coahuayana, La Orilla, La Placita, Playa Azul, and Pomaro) resemble _U.\r\nbicarinatus tuberculatus_ to the north along the Pacific coast.\r\nFurthermore, specimens from the coast have less stippling in the gular\r\nregion than do those from the Sierra de Coalcoman and the slopes of the\r\nCordillera Volcanica. Specimens from the mountains have greatly carinate\r\nenlarged dorsals, large lateral tubercles, and heavily stippled throats;\r\nin these characters they resemble specimens from Morelos, Guerrero, and\r\nOaxaca. As mentioned by Peters (1954:14), some specimens from La Orilla\r\nand San Salvador are like _U. bicarinatus bicarinatus_ in certain\r\ncharacters, and one specimen has the blue ventral patches restricted to\r\nthe sternal area, a characteristic of _U. bicarinatus anonymorphus_ of\r\nOaxaca and eastern Guerrero. Examination of all available specimens from\r\nMichoacan indicates that the nature of the dorsal scales is of little\r\nvalue in separating the subspecies. The specimens from Michoacan are\r\nhere provisionally referred to _U. bicarinatus tuberculatus_, because\r\ncursory examination of specimens from several localities between Nayarit\r\nand Oaxaca shows that there are only minor differences between the named\r\npopulations. Individuals from the northern part of the range are more\r\nrugose and have larger blue ventral patches and less gular stippling\r\nthan those from the south.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan _Urosaurus bicarinatus tuberculatus_ is found in wooded\r\nareas, not in open scrub forest, in the coastal area to elevations of\r\nabout 900 meters, and along the slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica and\r\nthe southern edge of the Mexican Plateau at elevations from 1000 to 1700\r\nmeters. The record for Tupataro probably is erroneous, for no other\r\nspecimens of this species are known from the central plateau.\r\nEssentially, the distribution of this species parallels that of\r\n_Sceloporus utiformis_, a strictly terrestrial species. _Urosaurus\r\nbicarinatus tuberculatus_ lives on tree trunks. Below 1000 meters in the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley _Urosaurus bicarinatus tuberculatus_ is replaced by\r\n_Urosaurus gadowi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Urosaurus gadowi~ (Schmidt)\r\n\r\n     _Uta gadovi_ Schmidt, Amer.

These small lizards usually are found on the\r\ntrunks and main branches of the small trees in the scrub forest; in this\r\nhabitat they are associated with _Sceloporus horridus oligoporus_, a\r\nmuch larger species.\r\n\r\nMales have a pale orange spot on the throat and a pale blue belly;\r\nfemales have immaculate venters.\r\n\r\nA specimen from Guayabo on the northern slopes of the Sierra de\r\nCoalcoman was referred to _Urosaurus irregularis_ (Fischer) by Peters\r\n(1954:15). I have studied this specimen (BMNH 1914.1.28.110), a female\r\nhaving a snout-vent length of 46 mm., and agree with Peters that it\r\nclosely resembles Fischer's description and figure (1882: pl. 17, fig.\r\n1). This specimen and those seen of _Urosaurus gadowi_ all have\r\npavementlike enlarged dorsal scales that are complete across the\r\nvertical line. In _U. gadowi_ the enlarged dorsals usually are in four\r\nto six irregular rows; in the specimen from Guayabo the dorsals are in\r\ntwo rows. Although none of the other specimens of _U. gadowi_ examined\r\nhas only two rows of enlarged dorsals, I prefer to consider the specimen\r\nfrom Guayabo as an aberrant individual of that species, rather than _U.\r\nirregularis_. Guayabo is in the known range of _U. gadowi_. _Urosaurus\r\nirregularis_ is known only from the type specimen in the Bremen Museum;\r\nthe type locality, according to Fischer (1882:232), is \"Aus dem\r\nHochlande von Mexico.\" If an examination of the type specimen of _U.\r\nirregularis_ shows it to be identical with _U. gadowi_, then _U.\r\nirregularis_ would be the name for the lizards here referred to _U.\r\ngadowi_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Mabuya brachypoda~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Mabuya brachypoda_ Taylor, Univ.

Webb (1958:1311) provided\r\nevidence that Mexican specimens were conspecific with _Mabuya\r\nbrachypoda_, as described from Costa Rica by Taylor (1956:308). The\r\nlarge series in the Taylor collection studied by Webb and listed by him\r\nas being from Uruapan actually is part of a series collected by Hobart\r\nM. Smith at El Sabino at an elevation of 1050 meters, 30 kilometers\r\nsouth of Uruapan.\r\n\r\nThis species probably ranges throughout the coastal region of the state;\r\nindividuals from La Placita and Playa Azul were taken in dense scrub\r\nforest near sea level.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Scincella assata taylori~ (Oliver)\r\n\r\n     _Leiolopisma assatum taylori_ Oliver, Occ.

E of Apatzingan; El Sabino (4).\r\n\r\nOne specimen of this rare species was found beneath a rock in the open\r\nscrub forest 12 kilometers east of Apatzingan on July 3, 1955. Another\r\nskink, presumably of this species, was seen at Capirio. The specimen\r\nfrom east of Apatzingan is a male having a snout-vent length of 97 mm.\r\nand an incomplete tail. In most respects it compares favorably with\r\naccounts of the species given by Taylor (1936b:55 and 1936c:102). The\r\nfrontal is divided by a transverse suture; the enlarged dorsal scales\r\nare arranged in 11 pairs anteriorly, followed by 48 unpaired enlarged\r\nscales. The head and middorsal area are brown; there is a pale tan\r\nstripe on the edges of the vertebral and paravertebral rows, bordered by\r\na dark brown stripe on the paravertebral row, which, in turn, is\r\nbordered by a pale tan stripe on the lateral edge of the paravertebral\r\nscale row and the median edge of the adjacent scale row. The stripes\r\nextend from the neck to the base of the tail. The flanks are mottled\r\nwith brown and cream-color; the labials are cream-color barred by brown;\r\nthe venter is a pale cream-color.\r\n\r\nDuges (1891:485) described _Eumeces altamirani_ from \"las regiones\r\ncalidas del Estado de Michoacan\" and subsequently (1896:480) gave\r\nApatzingan as a locality for the species. Presumably he had only one\r\nspecimen. In 1935 Hobart M. Smith collected the species at El Sabino on\r\nthe lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica bordering the Tepalcatepec\r\nValley.

In all\r\nspecimens the number of lamellae beneath the fourth toe varies from 26\r\nto 33 (29.7). In life juveniles have a pale olive-tan dorsum and a\r\ndorsolateral dark band, superimposed on which is a row of darker brown\r\nspots. The dorsolateral band is bordered below by a narrow cream-colored\r\nstripe. The tail is tan above and grayish white below; the belly is pale\r\nbluish white. Adult males are brilliantly colored in life. A male having\r\na snout-vent length of 108 mm. had a rusty brown dorsum and bright blue\r\nbars on the flanks separated by dark brown interspaces. The side of the\r\nhead was pale green, and the chin and throat were golden yellow. In some\r\nspecimens the throat is orange. Juveniles and subadults have dark flecks\r\non the brown or tan middorsal area, but these are absent in the largest\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits the heavily wooded areas in the lowlands to\r\nelevations of about 950 meters. In the Tepalcatepec Valley it has been\r\nfound only in gallery forests along streams.

Sixteen specimens from the coastal regions\r\nof Michoacan have 129-146 (136.3) granules; nine from the Tepalcatepec\r\nValley have 124-137 (128.3), and 44 from Coalcoman at an elevation of\r\n950 meters in the Sierra de Coalcoman, intermediate geographically\r\nbetween the coast and the Tepalcatepec Valley, have 105-144 (119.7). The\r\nnumber of granules in specimens from the coast of Michoacan compares\r\nfavorably with the range of 118-154 (137.8) for 34 specimens from\r\nColima, Colima (Zweifel, 1959a:107).

Since\r\n_occidentalis_ and _zweifeli_ are conspecific, the combination _C.\r\ncostatus zweifeli_ is used here for the population inhabiting the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley.\r\n\r\nThis lizard is abundant in the Tepalcatepec Valley, where it lives in\r\nopen and dense scrub forest, usually at elevations of less than 1000\r\nmeters.

In this area it inhabits dense arid\r\nscrub forest and semi-deciduous broad-leafed forest. Both of these\r\nhabitats are continuous, or nearly so, along the lowlands and foothills\r\nof the Sierra de Coalcoman. This in itself may explain the abundance of\r\n_Cnemidophorus lineatissimus_ and the relative scarcity of _C. deppei_\r\nand _C. communis_ in the coastal area, for _C. deppei_ and _C. communis_\r\nusually inhabit more open arid scrub forest, as occurs in the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley. Living in the dense scrub forest with _C.\r\nlineatissimus_ is _Ameiva undulata sinistra_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Cnemidophorus scalaris~ Cope\r\n\r\n     _Cnemidophorus gularis scalaris_ Cope, Trans. Amer.

Forty-two specimens from the south shore of Lago de Cuitzeo\r\n(UMMZ 119558) have 80-91 (85.8) dorsal granules. Four specimens from 21\r\nkilometers north of Norelia (UIMNH 6952 and UMMZ 104743) have 89, 78,\r\n92, and 84 granules; one from Morelia (UMMZ 104742) has 78; two from\r\nAraro (UMMZ 119522) have 80 and 87; one from Jacona (UIMNH 24703) has\r\n88.\r\n\r\nSince no large adult males are present in the series from Michoacan, an\r\nadequate comparison of coloration between these and populations on the\r\nnorthern part of the Mexican Plateau cannot be made. _Cnemidophorus\r\nscalaris_ is a name applied to the lizards inhabiting the Mexican\r\nPlateau from Chihuahua south to Puebla by Zweifel (1959a:72). It is\r\ndoubtful if all of the populations assigned to this subspecies belong\r\nthere; possibly more than one species is involved, but the paucity of\r\nmaterial prevents further analysis at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Heloderma horridum horridum~ (Wiegmann)\r\n\r\n     _Trachyderma horridum_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 22:421,\r\n     1829.--Mexico.

Of 45\r\nspecimens from Cerro Tancitaro and adjacent areas on the Mexican Plateau\r\nand in the Cordillera Volcanica, 15 have twelve longitudinal rows of\r\ndorsal scales and 30 have fourteen rows. Of seven specimens from the\r\nstate of Mexico, 5 have twelve rows and 2 have fourteen; of nine\r\nspecimens from central Veracruz, 8 have twelve rows and one has\r\nfourteen; of six specimens from Hidalgo, 5 have twelve rows and one has\r\nsixteen; of two specimens from Guanajuata, one has fourteen and the\r\nother has sixteen rows. All of the 35 specimens from the Sierra de\r\nCoalcoman have sixteen rows. Furthermore, these specimens have the\r\nsuperciliary row extended anteriorly, so that the anterior superciliary\r\nis in broad contact with the loreal. Specimens from Cerro Tancitaro have\r\na shorter superciliary row, so that the anterior superciliary is not in\r\nbroad contact with the loreal. These characters were used by Tihen\r\n(1949:220) to distinguish _Gerrhonotus imbricatus ciliaris_ from _G.\r\nimbricatus imbricatus_. According to Tihen, the subspecies _G.\r\nimbricatus ciliaris_ ranges from Guanajuato and Hidalgo northward to\r\nChihuahua and Coahuila, whereas the nominal subspecies occurs from\r\nMichoacan and Hidalgo southward to Oaxaca. Specimens from the Sierra de\r\nAutlan in Jalisco are like those from Cerro Tancitaro; consequently,\r\nthere seems to be no connection between the populations of _G.\r\nimbricatus ciliaris_ in the mountains of the northern part of the\r\nMexican Plateau with the _ciliaris_-like individuals found in the Sierra\r\nde Coalcoman. The acquisition and study of additional material from\r\nthroughout the range of the species is necessary to clarify the picture\r\nof geographic variation. Until then, I prefer to consider all of the\r\nspecimens from Michoacan as _Gerrhonotus imbricatus imbricatus_.\r\n\r\nThe largest specimen is a male having a snout-vent length of 136 mm. Two\r\njuveniles collected in July 24, 1960, have snout-vent lengths of 36 and\r\n42 mm. A specimen having a snout-vent length of 127 mm. and a tail\r\nlength of 145 mm. was regurgitated by a _Crotalus pusillus_, which had a\r\nbody length of 550 mm.\r\n\r\n_Gerrhonotus imbricatus imbricatus_ is an inhabitant of coniferous\r\nforests. In the Cordillera Volcanica it occurs from 1500 to 3500 meters\r\nat the top of Cerro Tancitaro. In the Sierra de Coalcoman it occurs from\r\n2100 to 2700 meters. On July 4, 1955, a pair was found in copulation\r\nbeneath a pine log at 2700 meters on Cerro Barolosa. The male was lying\r\non top of the female and was holding her head firmly in his jaws; the\r\nmale's tail was curled under the female's tail, so that the cloacae were\r\nin contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpentes\r\n\r\n~Typhlops braminus~ (Daudin)\r\n\r\n     _Eryx braminus_ Daudin, Hist.... des reptiles, 7:279,\r\n     1803.--Vazagapatam, India.\r\n\r\n     _Typhlops braminus_, Cuvier, Regne animal, ed. 2, 2:73,\r\n     1829.\r\n\r\n     Apatzingan; Arteaga.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth specimens known from Michoacan were collected by Gadow in 1908.\r\nPeters (1954:20) remarked that the specimen from Arteaga probably does\r\nnot indicate a rapid spreading of the species, which most likely was\r\nintroduced into Mexico at the time that vessels were stopping at\r\nAcapulco from the Philippines (Taylor, 1940b:444), but instead may\r\nindicate that pack trains from Acapulco passed through the Sierra de\r\nCoalcoman. The occurrence of this snake along a long-used _camino_\r\nsubstantiates this belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Leptotyphlops bressoni~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Leptotyphlops bressoni_ Taylor, Copeia, No. 1:5, March 9,\r\n     1939.--Hacienda El Sabino, Michoacan, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     El Sabino.\r\n\r\nThis species still is known definitely only from the type specimen\r\ncollected on the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica at the\r\nnorthern edge of the Tepalcatepec Valley. A specimen (now lost) reported\r\nfrom Aguililla by Cope (1887:63) possibly represents this species (see\r\nSmith and Taylor, 1945:21, and Peters, 1954:20).\r\n\r\n\r\n~Leptotyphlops gadowi~ Duellman\r\n\r\n     _Leptotyphlops gadowi_ Duellman, Copeia, No. 2:93, May 29,\r\n     1956.--Apatzingan, Michoacan, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Apatzingan.\r\n\r\nNo additional specimens of this species have been collected since the\r\nspecies was described by Duellman (1956b:93). Data given with the\r\nspecimen by Gadow indicate that it came from his camp above Apatzingan\r\nat an elevation of about 800 meters. Although the exact position of this\r\ncamp is unknown, the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica above\r\nApatzingan usually support arid scrub forest at elevations below 1000\r\nmeters. Therefore, this species probably is an inhabitant of the arid\r\nscrub forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Leptotyphlops phenops bakewelli~ Oliver\r\n\r\n     _Leptotyphlops bakewelli_ Oliver, Occ. Pap. Mus. Zool.

This specimen (BMNH 1914.1.28.124) is a\r\nmale having 235 ventrals and 47 caudals, a dark brown dorsum, and\r\ncream-colored labials and venter. The anterior chin-shields are\r\nconsiderably longer than the scales bordering the chin-shields. In these\r\ncharacters this specimen agrees with the diagnosis of _Loxocemus\r\nbicolor_ given by Taylor (1940c:447), who revived _Loxocemus\r\nsumichrasti_ Bocourt. Of the six specimens from Apatzingan in the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley, three males have 243 to 253 (246.6) ventrals and 44\r\nto 45 (44.3) caudals; three females have 238 to 247 (244.0) ventrals and\r\n42 to 44 (43.0) caudals. Certain characters of scutellation utilized by\r\nTaylor for separating _L. bicolor_ and _L. sumichrasti_ are inconsistent\r\nin this series. The chin-shields are longer than the adjacent scales,\r\nlike those illustrated in _L. bicolor_ by Taylor (_op. cit._, fig. 1).\r\nThe relative lengths of the prefrontal and internasal sutures are\r\nsubequal, or the prefrontal suture is slightly longer. Thus, in these\r\ncharacters of scutellation these snakes are like _L. bicolor_, but in\r\ncoloration they are like _L. sumichrasti_; the dorsal color in life was\r\nan iridescent dark bluish gray, and the belly was pale gray or bluish\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nThe supposed differences in scutellation between _L. bicolor_ and _L.\r\nsumichrasti_ have been questioned by Woodbury and Woodbury (1944:360);\r\nthese authors treated _L. sumichrasti_ as a subspecies of _L. bicolor_.\r\nAs pointed out by Zweifel (1959b:5), such an arrangement is not tenable,\r\nfor, although individuals with each kind of color pattern have not been\r\ncollected together at any one locality, the over-all geographic picture\r\nis one of sympatric distribution. Only snakes having the coloration of\r\n_L. sumichrasti_ have been collected in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin. I\r\nagree with Zweifel (_loc. cit._) that on the basis of morphological\r\nsimilarities and sympatric distribution, _L. bicolor_ and _L.\r\nsumichrasti_ seem to be dimorphic phases of the same species, showing no\r\nmore striking differences in coloration than _Lampropeltis getulus\r\ncaliforniae_, a now classical example of pattern dimorphism in snakes.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan, as in other parts of its range, _Loxocemus bicolor_\r\ninhabits arid scrub forest environments at low elevations.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Boa constrictor imperator~ Daudin\r\n\r\n     _Boa imperator_ Daudin, Hist. nat.... des reptiles, 5:150,\r\n     1803.--Mexico.

Additional specimens from the\r\nSierra de Coalcoman will be required in order to determine whether this\r\nspecimen is a representative of an orange-colored population or merely\r\nis aberrant in coloration.\r\n\r\nThe present specimen is from an elevation of 900 meters in oak forest on\r\nthe southern slopes of the Sierra de Coalcoman; other locality records\r\nfor the species indicate that it inhabits broad-leafed forest in\r\nfoothills from Nayarit to Puebla.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Conophis vittatus vittatus~ Peters\r\n\r\n     _Conophis vittatus_ Peters, Monats.

Posteriorly the blotches are less distinct, fading into the\r\nuniform grayish tan ground color of the posterior part of the body. The\r\nblotches extend laterally onto the fourth and fifth scale rows. Large\r\nsquarish lateral intercalary blotches of darker brown interconnect with\r\nthe dorsal blotches. The top of the head is pale olive-brown; a dark\r\nbrown postorbital stripe extends from the eye to the posterior edge of\r\nthe last upper labial. The labials, chin, and ventrals 1-30 are creamy\r\nwhite, changing to a dusty cream-color posteriorly; the chin and\r\nventrals 1-30 are heavily spotted with dark brown.

A juvenile from Capirio in the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley (UMMZ 114627) is black above and has pale\r\nolive-colored flecks on the anterior one-third of the body; the top of\r\nthe head is dark olive-brown, and the sides of the head are somewhat\r\npaler. Anteriorly the belly is a cream-color; posteriorly it is black.\r\n\r\nThe specimens from the Tepalcatepec Valley are typical of _Drymarchon\r\ncorais rubidus_.

The specimen from La\r\nPalma, like many others from various localities on the Mexican Plateau,\r\nresembles in certain characters _D. corais orizabensis_ (Smith, _op.\r\ncit._: 477). Our knowledge of the geographical variation in coloration\r\nin this species is incomplete; many populations have been assigned to\r\nsubspecific rank without justification.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan this species is found from sea level to 1350 meters in the\r\nSierra de Coalcoman and to 1300 meters at La Palma on Lago de Chapala.\r\nIt has been collected in scrub forest, semi-deciduous broad-leafed\r\nforest, and oak forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Drymobius margaritiferus fistulosus~ Smith\r\n\r\n     _Drymobius margaritiferus fistulosus_ Smith, Proc.

It most frequently is found near\r\nwater, where there is a dense growth of vegetation. One individual was\r\nobserved in a large pool inhabited by several small _Rana pipiens_, and\r\nanother was seen along the bank of a hyacinth-choked river channel. A\r\nthird individual was captured while it was in pursuit of a\r\n_Cnemidophorus_.\r\n\r\nThis species has been collected on the coastal lowlands and seaward\r\nfoothills of the Sierra de Coalcoman and in the Tepalcatepec Valley to\r\nelevations of 1150 meters.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Elaphe triaspis intermedia~ (Boettger)\r\n\r\n     _Pityophis intermedius_ Boettger, Ber.

All specimens from Michoacan were collected in open\r\nforest, either scrub or oak forest. They were found in drier situations\r\nthan those described for the species in southern Tamaulipas by Martin\r\n(1958:69). In Michoacan _Elaphe triaspis intermedia_ is known from the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley, the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica, and\r\nthe western edge of the Mexican Plateau at an elevation of 1350 meters.\r\nIt probably occurs in the lower parts of the Sierra de Coalcoman and\r\nalong the Pacific coast, for it is known from the coastal lowlands of\r\nGuerrero and Colima.

The limited ecological data suggest that the\r\nspecies inhabits the transition zone between the tropical scrub forest\r\nand the temperate hardwood forest.\r\n\r\nAll of the specimens have 17 rows of scales; four males have 169-178\r\n(174.2) ventrals and 102-111 (106.8) caudals; two females have 192 and\r\n195 ventrals and 96 and 87 caudals.

Although Fischer gave the type locality only\r\nas \"Mazatlan\" and did not designate the state, it is probable that the\r\ntype originated from Mazatlan, Sinaloa. The present specimens are from a\r\nlocality almost midway between Tehuantepec and Mazatlan and support the\r\npossibility that _Geagras_ ranges along the Pacific coast of Mexico from\r\nOaxaca to Sinaloa.\r\n\r\nThe two specimens from Michoacan (UMMZ 114446-7), both males, have 118\r\nand 122 ventrals, 31 and 33 caudals, body lengths of 108 and 81 mm., and\r\ntail lengths of 20 and 15 mm. Both have 1-1 preoculars, 1-1 postoculars,\r\n1-2 temporals, 6-6 upper labials, and 5-5 lower labials. In life, the\r\ndorsum was pale tan; the top of the head and the middorsal and lateral\r\nstripes were dark brown; the belly was white. The occipital spots were\r\npale pinkish tan. Both specimens were found beneath rocks in tropical\r\nsemi-deciduous forest at an elevation of 15 meters on the coastal plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Geophis dugesi~ Bocourt\r\n\r\n     _Geophis dugesii_ Bocourt, Miss.

An illustration, presumably of the same\r\nspecimen, by Duges (1884:Pl. 9) shows five distinct and one indistinct\r\ncross-bands. Of the four specimens that I have examined, none has more\r\nthan three pale cross-bands, and one has only one indistinct cross-band.\r\nTwo females have 154 and 158 ventrals and 38 and 37 caudals; two males\r\nhave 150 and 151 ventrals and 43 and 42 caudals.\r\n\r\nThis species is known only from elevations between 1750 and 2050 meters\r\non the southwestern edge of the Mexican Plateau in the state of\r\nMichoacan.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Geophis incomptus~ Duellman\r\n\r\n     _Geophis incomptus_ Duellman, Occ.

Aside from the five\r\nspecimens comprising the type series, there are ten other specimens in\r\nthe Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan collected by Floyd\r\nL. Downs in July, 1960. Data from these specimens and those comprising\r\nthe type series show that in this sample seven males have 146-153\r\n(149.3) ventrals and 35-37 (36.0) caudals; eight females have 150-154\r\n(152.4) ventrals and 29-34 (32.5) caudals.

Only one other species\r\nin Mexico has dorsal scales in 15 rows and has an anterior temporal;\r\nthat species is _G. incomptus_, which differs from _G. maculiferus_ in\r\nhaving six or seven lower labials, instead of five, and in having the\r\nedges of the ventrals dark, instead of a uniformly cream-colored belly.\r\n\r\nThe locality from which the specimen was obtained lies at an elevation\r\nof 1630 meters on the southern slope of the Cordillera Volcanica. At\r\nthat elevation there is an interdigitation of arid tropical scrub forest\r\nand pine-oak forest; probably _Geophis maculiferus_ inhabits the\r\npine-oak forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Geophis nigrocinctus~ Duellman\r\n\r\n     _Geophis nigrocinctus_ Duellman, Occ.

A discussion of the variation in these specimens and of\r\nprobable relationships of the species was given by Duellman (1959).\r\nFloyd Downs spent several days at Dos Aguas in July, 1960; although he\r\nfound ten specimens of _Geophis incomptus_, no further specimens of _G.\r\nnigrocinctus_ were obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Geophis petersi~ Boulenger\r\n\r\n     _Geophis petersii_ Boulenger, Catalogue Snakes...

Type\r\n     locality restricted to Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico, by\r\n     Smith and Taylor (1950a:335).\r\n\r\n     Cheran; Coalcoman; Morelia; Patzcuaro (6).\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the most widespread species of _Geophis_ in Michoacan.\r\nIt has been found at elevations between 950 and 2350 meters, chiefly in\r\npine or pine-oak forest. Boulenger (1894:321) described _Geophis\r\npetersi_ from a specimen stated to be from Mexico City, a locality which\r\nprobably is in error. The only localities from which the species is\r\ndefinitely known are those listed in this account.\r\n\r\nThree males and five females from the Mexican Plateau and the Cordillera\r\nVolcanica have respectively 140-144 (141.7) and 143-151 (146.0) ventrals\r\nand 39-41 (40.0) and 29-35 (33.2) caudals. All have dorsal scales in 15\r\nrows, 1 postocular, no anterior temporal, and a relatively small\r\ntriangular supraocular. The specimen from Coalcoman (UMMZ 104698) was\r\nreferred to _Geophis nasalis_ by Peters (1954:22). This specimen is\r\nabnormal in several characters; in five places there is a fusion and\r\nseparation of the vertebral and paravertebral scale rows, producing a\r\nchange from 17 to 15 rows of dorsal scales. Fusion of the three rows\r\ntakes place at the level of the 8th, 41st, 47th, 54th, and 65th\r\nventrals. Furthermore, there is a small secondary postocular on each\r\nside of the head. In other characters the specimen is like _G. petersi_;\r\nthe resemblances to that species are greater than to _G. nasalis_, which\r\nhas been recorded from Guatemala and southern Chiapas.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Geophis tarascae~ Hartweg\r\n\r\n     _Geophis tarascae_ Hartweg, Occ.

Floyd\r\nL. Downs obtained another specimen in the Parque Nacional on July 19,\r\n1960. It has 164 ventrals and 46 caudals; in life, the ground color of\r\nthe neck was brown with a purplish tint; the dorsal markings were black;\r\nthe chin was a cream-color, and the belly was white. This specimen is\r\ndistinguished from those of all other species of _Geophis_ in Michoacan\r\nin that it has dark irregular cross-bars on the dorsum and a row of dark\r\nspots on the venter.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hypsiglena torquata ochrorhyncha~ Cope\r\n\r\n     _Hypsiglena ochrorhyncha_ Cope, Proc.

Nat. Hist., 83:378, March 30, 1945.\r\n\r\n     Tupataro.\r\n\r\nThe systematic status of the geographic variants of _Hypsiglena_ in\r\nMexico and southwestern United States has been commented on by several\r\nauthors. Tanner (1944) considered _H. torquata_ and _H. ochrorhyncha_ to\r\nbe distinct species; Bogert and Oliver (1945:379) and Duellman\r\n(1957b:238) presented evidence indicating that _H. torquata_ and _H.\r\nochrorhyncha_ intergrade in Sinaloa and southern Sonora. In _Hypsiglena_\r\nthe scutellation, including the numbers of labials, dorsals, ventrals,\r\nand caudals, seem to vary in a clinal manner. Nevertheless, these snakes\r\ncan be divided into two distinct populations on the basis of the nuchal\r\ncolor pattern, consisting of an _ochrorhyncha_-type (a broad dark\r\nnape-band, the lateral edges of which extend anteriorly and fuse with a\r\npostorbital stripe, and a narrow nape stripe extending from the\r\nposteromedian edges of the parietals to the dark nape band) and a\r\n_torquata_-type (a somewhat narrower dark nape-band bordered anteriorly\r\nby a pale nuchal area, and no dark nape stripe). Snakes having the\r\n_ochrorhyncha_-type of nuchal pattern are found on the Mexican Plateau\r\nfrom Michoacan northward into the desert regions of Sonora and the\r\nsouthwestern United States. Snakes having the _torquata_-type of pattern\r\nare found on the coastal lowlands and adjacent slopes of the Sierra\r\nMadre Occidental from southern Sinaloa to Colima and thence inland in\r\nthe Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin to Morelos and Guerrero. An exception is\r\n_Hypsiglena torquata dunklei_ from Forlon and San Fernando, Tamaulipas;\r\nit has the _torquata_-type of nuchal pattern. The distributional picture\r\nis somewhat complicated because some individuals having the\r\n_torquata_-type of nuchal pattern also have a faint nape stripe. If\r\nthese are taken as exceptions, the general picture of distribution in\r\nMexico is _H. t. torquata_ on the Pacific lowlands from Sinaloa\r\nsouthward to the Balsas Basin and _H. t. ochrorhyncha_ on the Mexican\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nSmith (1943:433) resurrected _Hypsiglena jani_ Duges for the snakes of\r\nthe _ochrorhyncha_-type on the southern part of the Mexican Plateau. He\r\nstated that the southern specimens differed from northern ones in having\r\na nuchal spot 9 or 10 scales in length, as compared with a spot 2 to 6\r\nscales in length in northern specimens. A cursory examination of\r\nspecimens from the areas between Arizona and Michoacan showed that there\r\nis a gradual increase in the size of the spot from north to south. If no\r\nother characters can be found to distinguish the populations, they\r\nshould be considered as a single subspecies.\r\n\r\n_Hypsiglena affinis_ differs from _H. torquata_ in possessing 19 instead\r\nof 21 rows of dorsal scales. Additional material is needed from the\r\nwestern slopes of Jalisco and the Barrancas in Zacatecas and Durango,\r\nbefore definite allocation of _affinis_ can be made.\r\n\r\nBogert and Oliver (1945:379) discussed the status of certain named\r\npopulations in Baja California and concluded that only one species\r\noccurs there, and that the species probably is conspecific with _H.\r\ntorquata_. A careful review of the genus _Hypsiglena_ might show that\r\nthere is only one species.\r\n\r\nThe one specimen from Michoacan (USNM 46513) is from an elevation of\r\nabout 2300 meters near the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hypsiglena torquata torquata~ (Guenther)\r\n\r\n     _Leptodeira torquata_ Guenther, Ann.

There are too\r\nfew specimens of this species to define the ranges of the various\r\nsubspecies with any degree of accuracy, but from the limited number of\r\nspecimens available, it seems that _I. gemmistratus gracillimus_ occurs\r\non the Pacific lowlands from Guerrero northward to Colima. Northward on\r\nthe Pacific lowlands from Colima to Sinaloa and in the\r\nBalsas-Tepalcatepec Basin is found _I. gemmistratus latistratus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Lampropeltis doliata~ (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n     _Coluber doliatus_ Linnaeus, Systema naturae, ed. 12, 1:379,\r\n     1766.--Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n     _Lampropeltis doliata_, Klauber, Copeia, No. 1:11, April 15,\r\n     1948.\r\n\r\n     Coalcoman (3); El Sabino; 24 km.

Specimens from the Sierra de Coalcoman have relatively\r\nnarrow red bands that are not interrupted dorsally by extensions of the\r\nblack rings; the scales in the red bands have black tips. The specimen\r\nfrom El Sabino (EHT-HMS 5253) and the one from the Rio Nexpa on the\r\ncoast (USNM 31491) have broader red bands; the scales in the red bands\r\ndo not have black tips. A specimen from 24 kilometers west of Morelia\r\n(UIMNH 17782) and one from Uruapan (UMMZ 121508) have the red bands\r\ninterrupted dorsally by extensions from the black rings.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from the Sierra de Coalcoman were referred to _L. doliata\r\nblanchardi_ by Peters (1954:24), who noted that in some characters\r\nthese snakes were like _L. d. nelsoni_ and in others like _L. d.\r\npolyzona_. The individual from El Sabino was referred to _L. d. nelsoni_\r\nby Taylor (1940c:465); the one from 24 kilometers west of Morelia was\r\nreferred to _L. d. arcifera_ by Smith (1942c:198). If these assignments\r\nare correct, three subspecies of _Lampropeltis doliata_ occur in\r\nMichoacan: _blanchardi_ in the Sierra de Coalcoman, _nelsoni_ on the\r\ncoast and in the Tepalcatepec Valley, and _arcifera_ on the Mexican\r\nPlateau and in the Cordillera Volcanica. Such a distribution is\r\nplausible, but the few specimens and our general lack of knowledge of\r\nthe variation and relationships of the different populations do not\r\npermit a definite assignment at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Lampropeltis ruthveni~ Blanchard\r\n\r\n     _Lampropeltis ruthveni_ Blanchard, Occ.

The specimens from El Sabino (EHT-HMS\r\n5441 and UIMNH 18933) and one from Coalcoman (UMMZ 104502) have the\r\ncream-colored line on the sixth and adjacent parts of the fifth and\r\nseventh scale rows and have a dark line on the second scale row. Another\r\nindividual from Volcan Jorullo (UMMZ 104682) has cream-colored lines\r\nlike the others, but it possesses two lateral dark lines, one on the\r\nsecond scale row, and one on the third.\r\n\r\nSmith (1942d:186) diagnosed _Rhadinaea hesperia hesperioides_ as\r\ndiffering from the nominal subspecies in having the cream-colored line\r\non the fourth and fifth scale rows and in possessing a dark line on the\r\nsecond scale row. The specimens seen all have the lateral cream-colored\r\nline centered on the sixth scale row, as is characteristic of _R. h.\r\nhesperia_. Although many of the specimens also possess a dark line on\r\nthe second scale row, these specimens are here assigned to _R. h.\r\nhesperia_. Additional specimens are necessary to define accurately the\r\nsubspecies and their ranges. Peters (1954:29) assigned the specimens\r\nfrom Coalcoman to _R. h. hesperioides_.\r\n\r\nIn life the specimens from Arteaga had bright cream-colored temporal\r\nstripes and dorsolateral stripes on the anterior part of the body. The\r\nchin and anterior one-sixth of the belly was white; posteriorly the\r\nventer was bright orange-red.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan this snake has been found in tropical semi-deciduous\r\nforest, arid scrub forest, and pine-oak forest at elevations from 850 to\r\n1500 meters.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Rhadinaea laureata~ (Guenther)\r\n\r\n     _Dromicus laureatus_ Guenther, Ann.

Davis and Dixon (1957:21) described a\r\nspecimen from Zacapu as having two dark paravertebral stripes diverging\r\non the temporals and extending through the eye onto the loreal, a\r\ncharacteristic of _Salvadora lineata_. On the basis of this specimen,\r\nDavis and Dixon suggested that _Salvadora bairdi_ and _S. lineata_ were\r\nsubspecifically related. The examination of the large number of\r\nspecimens from Michoacan has revealed this kind of coloration in only\r\none other specimen, an individual from Tacicuaro, in which the stripes\r\ndiverge, but do not extend through the eye onto the loreal. Data on\r\nscutellation for the large series from Tancitaro were given by Schmidt\r\nand Shannon (1947:78), and for the series from Tacicuaro by Smith\r\n(1943:466).\r\n\r\n\r\n~Salvadora mexicana~ (Dumeril, Bibron, and Dumeril)\r\n\r\n     _Zamenis mexicanus_ Dumeril, Bibron, and Dumeril,\r\n     Erpetologie generale, 7 (pt. 1), p. 695, 1854.--Cape\r\n     Corrientes, Jalisco, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     _Salvadora mexicana_ Guenther, Ann.

The\r\ndorsal pattern consists of a highly variable number of cross-bands of\r\nred, white, and black. In the specimens from Michoacan there are as many\r\nas 17 red cross-bands on the body. One specimen from Apatzingan (CNHM\r\n37141) has just behind the head a white band, bordered on either side by\r\na narrow black band; posteriorly the body is uniform red. Two specimens\r\nfrom Coalcoman (UMMZ 109905-6) have respectively 11 and 13 red\r\ncross-bands and 20 and 17 white cross-bands, and the posterior part of\r\nthe body is devoid of red color. Other specimens from these localities\r\nhave red, black, and white cross-bands throughout the length of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n_Sonora michoacanensis michoacanensis_ is distinguished from _S.\r\nmichoacanensis mutabilis_ by the presence of cross-bands on the tail in\r\nthe latter (Stickel, 1943:116).

Not infrequently, individuals\r\nhave been found in pine-oak forest within these elevations.\r\n\r\nThe generic status of _Toluca_ is unsettled. Taylor and Smith (1942b)\r\nseparated _Toluca_ from _Conopsis_ by the presence of enlarged and\r\ngrooved posterior maxillary teeth in _Toluca_ and their absence in\r\n_Conopsis_. Bogert and Oliver (1945:378) suggested synonymizing _Toluca_\r\nwith _Conopsis_. Smith and Laufe (1945:12) defined the generic position\r\nof _Toluca_. Actually, in deciding the generic position of these snakes,\r\nfive genera (_Ficimia_, _Gyalopion_, _Pseudoficimia_, _Conopsis_, and\r\n_Toluca_) must be considered. Of these _Ficimia_ and _Gyalopion_ are\r\nclosely related; they have been placed in one genus by some workers.\r\n_Pseudoficimia_ is intermediate between _Ficimia-Gyalopion_ and\r\n_Toluca-Conopsis_. A workable definition of the supraspecific\r\nclassification of these snakes must await a thorough review of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Trimorphodon biscutatus biscutatus~ (Dumeril, Bibron, and Dumeril)\r\n\r\n     _Dipsas biscutata_ Dumeril, Bibron, and Dumeril, Erpetologie\r\n     generale, 7 (pt. 2):1153, 1854.--Mexico.

In this area it occurs sympatrically\r\nwith _Trimorphodon biscutatus biscutatus_.\r\n\r\nIn life, adults have a pale tan dorsal ground color and rich chocolate\r\nbrown cross-bands; the eye is pale grayish tan. A juvenile from\r\nCoalcoman has black cross-bands on a pale grayish tan ground color. As\r\nstated by Schmidt and Shannon (1947:83) and Peters (1954:32), the type\r\nspecimen of _Trimorphodon fasciolata_ Smith from Cascada Tzararacua is\r\nindistinguishable from specimens of _Trimorphodon latifascia_.\r\n\r\nSeven males have 209 to 223 (216.5) ventrals; one female has 227\r\nventrals. The number of dark cross-bands on the body varies from 12 to\r\n16 (13.5). The relationships of this species are with _Trimorphodon\r\ntau_ on the Mexican Plateau. In fact, additional specimens from the\r\nheadwaters of the Tepalcatepec Valley and the lower slopes of the\r\nMexican Plateau in eastern Michoacan and adjacent Jalisco may show that\r\nthe two are conspecific. _Trimorphodon latifascia_ differs from _tau_ in\r\nhaving fewer dark cross-bands on the body and in lacking an interocular\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Trimorphodon tau~ Cope\r\n\r\n     _Trimorphodon tau_ Cope, Proc.

These markings supposedly are characteristic of _Trimorphodon\r\nupsilon_. One specimen from Emiliano Zapata (UMMZ 118950) and one from\r\nbetween Morelia and Ciudad Hidalgo (EHT-HMS 21402) have a cream-colored\r\nline on the parietal suture; in another specimen from Emiliano Zapata\r\n(UMMZ 118949) the anterior end of this line is expanded, giving the\r\nappearance of an incipient \"Y\". Thus, the nature of the markings on the\r\nhead in specimens from Michoacan is intermediate between the typical\r\ncondition in _Trimorphodon tau_ and the usual condition in _T. upsilon_.\r\nSmith and Taylor (1945:148) gave the range of _Trimorphodon tau_ as:\r\n\"Central Guerrero, in the Sierra Madre del Sur; central Oaxaca; and the\r\nedge of the plateau in central Michoacan.\" They gave the range of\r\n_Trimorphodon upsilon_ as: \"Southern Chihuahua south to central\r\nMichoacan, east to central Hidalgo.\" Specimens referable to _T. tau_\r\nhave been found at La Joya de Salas, near Ciudad Victoria, and near\r\nLlera, Tamaulipas (see Smith and Darling, 1952:85, and Martin, 1958:74).\r\nSome of these specimens also show combinations of characteristics of _T.\r\ntau_ and _T. upsilon_. Smith and Darling (_loc. cit._) suggested that\r\n_T. tau_ and _T. upsilon_ be considered as subspecies. However, if _T.\r\ntau_ and _T. upsilon_ are subspecies, intergrades would be expected\r\nbetween the ranges of the two populations and not on the northeastern\r\nand southwestern periphery of their combined ranges. Instead, the\r\nlimited evidence now available suggests that _T. tau_ and _T. upsilon_\r\nare names based on a highly variable character of color pattern of the\r\nhead, and that only one species is involved.\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan this species inhabits the mesquite grassland on the Mexican\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Tropidodipsas occidentala~ Oliver\r\n\r\n     _Tropidodipsas occidentala_ Oliver, Occ.

These data\r\nshow that, although there is little difference in the number of caudals,\r\nspecimens from the Sierra de Coalcoman have fewer ventrals than do\r\nspecimens from the Cordillera Volcanica. Of eleven specimens from the\r\nSierra de Coalcoman, two have black bellies.

Smith recognized in Michoacan three members of the _T. eques_ (=\r\n_dorsalis_) complex: _eques eques_, _eques postremus_, and _vicinus_.\r\nLater, Smith (1951) showed that the specific name _eques_ had been\r\nmisapplied, so that _T. eques eques_ became _T. cyrtopsis cyclides_, and\r\n_T. eques postremus_ became _T. cyrtopsis postremus_; under this\r\narrangement _T. vicinus_ stood unchanged. In the meantime, Bogert and\r\nOliver (1945:359) presented a reinterpretation of Smith's data and\r\nsuggested that _T. vicinus_, which differs from _T. dorsalis cyclides_\r\nonly in lacking a middorsal stripe, \"... is not a species, but only a\r\npattern phase, possibly a simple mutant of _T. e. eques_\" (= _T.\r\ndorsalis cyclides_, by present arrangement). Milstead (1953) agreed with\r\nBogert and Oliver on the status of _T. vicinus_; furthermore, on the\r\nbasis of only a few specimens, Milstead concluded that _T. cyrtopsis\r\npostremus_ was not subspecifically distinct from _T. cyrtopsis\r\ncyclides_. Recently, Fitch and Milstead (1961) showed that _Thamnophis\r\ndorsalis_ Baird and Girard (1853) was the correct name for the snakes\r\nthat had been recognized as _Thamnophis cyrtopsis_ Kennicott (1860).\r\nConsequently, the snakes referred to _T. eques eques_ by Smith (1942)\r\nand to _T. cyrtopsis cyclides_ by Smith (1951) and Milstead (1953) are\r\nnow _T. dorsalis cyclides_.\r\n\r\nAside from one specimen from Temazcal and nine from Morelia (paratypes\r\nof _T. vicinus_), only two other specimens completely lacking the\r\nmiddorsal stripe have been seen; one is a male (UMMZ 102510) having 161\r\nventrals and an incomplete tail from Pino Gordo, and the other is a male\r\n(CNHM 39060) from Tancitaro having 158 ventrals and an incomplete tail.\r\nA female from Tancitaro (CNHM 39061) having 153 ventrals and 77 caudals\r\nhas no lateral stripes and only a narrow middorsal stripe on the\r\nanterior part of the body. Throughout the region where _T. vicinus_-like\r\nsnakes have been found, typical _T. dorsalis cyclides_ occurs in much\r\ngreater numbers. I concur with Bogert and Oliver in placing _T. vicinus_\r\nas a synonym of _T. dorsalis cyclides_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Dorsal color pattern of _Thamnophis dorsalis\r\ncyclides_ (A) and _Thamnophis dorsalis postremus_ (B).]\r\n\r\nMilstead (1953) had available few specimens of _Thamnophis dorsalis_\r\nfrom the Tepalcatepec Valley. The large series now in existence shows\r\nthat the population in the Tepalcatepec Valley differs distinctly from\r\nthat inhabiting the Mexican Plateau, Cordillera Volcanica, and Sierra de\r\nCoalcoman. Therefore the name _T. dorsalis postremus_ Smith (1942) is\r\nresurrected for the population in the Tepalcatepec Valley. _T. dorsalis\r\ncyclides_ and _T. dorsalis postremus_ differ in color pattern (Fig. 10)\r\nand in scutellation (Table 6). Specimens from the Mexican Plateau and\r\nmountain ranges have a distinct light stripe on the second and third\r\nscale rows, a dark brown dorsum having squarish black spots, and a row\r\nof dark spots on the first row of dorsal scales. Specimens from the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley have a grayish brown dorsum having smaller and less\r\ndistinct dark spots and no light stripe on the second and third scale\r\nrows; the first, second, and third rows of scales are colored like the\r\nventer. In some specimens there are small dark flecks on the first row\r\nof dorsal scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 6.--VARIATION IN SCUTELLATION IN THAMNOPHIS DORSALIS.\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------+-------+---------+------------+\r\n|           Character             |Mexican|Sierra de|Tepalcatepec|\r\n|                                 |Plateau|Coalcoman|   Valley   |\r\n+------------------+--------------+-------+---------+------------+\r\n|     Ventrals     | Female  N    |  31   |    2    |     32     |\r\n|                  |         Mean | 164.0 |  156.5  |   144.6    |\r\n|                  |         Range|153-171| 154-159 |  138-151   |\r\n|                  +--------------+-------+---------+------------+\r\n|                  |    Male N    |  19   |    2    |     32     |\r\n|                  |         Mean | 153.5 |  154.7  |   138.3    |\r\n|                  |         Range|149-159| 149-159 |  131-141   |\r\n+------------------+--------------+-------+---------+------------+\r\n|     Caudals      | Female  N    |  28   |    2    |     29     |\r\n|                  |         Mean | 83.8  |  81.0   |    73.4    |\r\n|                  |         Range|80-100 |  79-83  |   70-79    |\r\n|                  +--------------+-------+---------+------------+\r\n|                  |    Male N    |  14   |    2    |     28     |\r\n|                  |         Mean | 78.0  |  72.0   |    68.5    |\r\n|                  |         Range| 71-87 |   72    |   63-73    |\r\n+------------------+--------------+-------+---------+------------+\r\n\r\nOne specimen from Uruapan (1550 meters) and one from Coalcoman (950\r\nmeters) are intermediate in color pattern between _T. dorsalis cyclides_\r\nand _T. dorsalis postremus_.

In certain features of coloration and in the low numbers of\r\nventrals and caudals, _T. dorsalis postremus_ shows more resemblance to\r\n_T. dorsalis sumichrasti_ than to _T. dorsalis cyclides_. According to\r\nMilstead (1953:367), _T. dorsalis cyclides_ ranges southward from the\r\nRio Balsas in southwestern Mexico. If specimens could be obtained from\r\nthe upper Balsas Basin they might show that _T. dorsalis postremus_\r\ninhabits that extensive basin.\r\n\r\nIn the Tepalcatepec Valley _T. dorsalis postremus_ is most frequently\r\nfound at night in the rainy season, at which time the snakes are\r\nabundant near temporary pools where frogs are breeding. The absence of\r\nspecimens from the coastal lowlands of Guerrero, Michoacan, and Colima\r\nindicate that, although the species inhabits the lowlands of the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley, its range does not include the coastal lowlands.\r\n\r\nA female (UMMZ 119402 from Cuatro Caminos) having 139 ventrals and a\r\nbody length of 576 mm., on June 20, 1958, gave birth to 25 young, of\r\nwhich 18 (9 males and 9 females) were preserved.

In May, 1956,\r\nDonald D. Brand of the University of Texas gave me one specimen of\r\n_Pelamis platurus_ that he obtained on March 2, 1956, at Boca de Apiza.\r\nFurthermore, he supplied me with the following observations based on his\r\nfield work along the coast of Michoacan from the Rio Coahuayana to\r\nMaruata from March 1, to April 15, 1956. At that time many sea snakes\r\nwere observed; in some places living and dead individuals were seen on\r\nthe beaches; innumerable snakes were seen in the surf. When live\r\nindividuals were taken from the beach and thrown into the ocean, they\r\nusually swam to shore. Many partially eaten individuals were seen\r\nprotruding from crab holes. Inquiries among the natives resulted in the\r\nfollowing information: Sea snakes are frequently seen between November\r\nand April, but most commonly in March and April, at which time the water\r\nis cold. The natives referred to the sea snakes as \"culebra del mar.\"\r\nMost natives said that the snakes were not poisonous; others did not\r\nknow of any venomous properties. In May, 1956, I worked the coastal\r\nregion from the Rio Coahuayana to La Placita and saw no sea snakes. In\r\nthe summer of 1950 James A. Peters, and in the summer of 1951 I worked\r\nnearly the entire coastal region of Michoacan; during that time no\r\n_Pelamis_ were seen. Insofar as I know, this is the first report of such\r\nseasonal activity in _Pelamis platurus_ in the Americas.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Agkistrodon bilineatus bilineatus~ Guenther\r\n\r\n     _Ancisdrodon bilineatus_ Guenther, Ann.

The one from Los Reyes (USNM 46416) was collected by Nelson\r\nand Goldman on February 13, 1903. The elevation of Los Reyes (1500\r\nmeters) seems unusually high for this species, but otherwise there is no\r\nreason to doubt the authenticity of the record. Goldman (1951:192) in\r\nhis description of Los Reyes stated: \"Los Reyes is near the boundary\r\nbetween the Lower Austral and Arid Upper Tropical Zones but is\r\npreponderantly tropical in zonal character. The regular crops are mainly\r\nsugar cane, rice, and corn.\" Thus the biotic features of the area are\r\nnot noticeably different from those at El Sabino and La Playa at lower\r\nelevations. The development of extensive agriculture through irrigation\r\nin the Tepalcatepec Valley and planting of rice and sugar-cane in that\r\narea may produce a more widespread habitat for this snake.\r\n\r\nThe absence of specimens from the coastal lowlands is due solely to\r\ninadequate collecting; the natives there know the snake and report that\r\nit is not uncommon in certain areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Crotalus basiliscus basiliscus~ (Cope)\r\n\r\n     _Caudisonia basilisca_ Cope, Proc.

Klauber (1952:81) gave the\r\nfollowing data for _Crotalus basiliscus_ (based on specimens from the\r\nentire range, except Oaxaca): ventrals in males, 179-201 (191.4), in\r\nfemales, 185-206 (197.6); caudals in males, 26-36 (30.7), in females,\r\n21-29 (24.4). Klauber (1952:84) remarked that the one specimen that he\r\nhad seen from Apatzingan had fewer ventrals and caudals than most other\r\nspecimens. The low numbers of ventrals and caudals in specimens from\r\nMichoacan, as compared with more northern populations, may be indicative\r\nof a trend in the reduction of the numbers of these scutes from north to\r\nsouth. The southernmost examples of _Crotalus basiliscus_ (_Crotalus\r\nbasiliscus oaxacus_ from Oaxaca) have 172-175 ventrals and 21 caudals\r\n(Gloyd, 1948).\r\n\r\nIn Michoacan _Crotalus basiliscus basiliscus_ has been found in arid\r\nhabitats on the coast, in the Tepalcatepec Valley, and in the lower\r\nparts of the Sierra de Coalcoman.

San Diego,\r\n     26:34, August 8, 1952.--Tancitaro, Michoacan, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Acuaro de las Lleguas (2); Carapan; Cerro Tancitaro (16);\r\n     Dos Aguas (12).\r\n\r\nAside from the type series of _Crotalus pusillus_ from Cerro Tancitaro\r\nand one specimen from Carapan referred to the species by Klauber\r\n(1952:38), there are fourteen specimens from the Sierra de Coalcoman.\r\nThese specimens (UMMZ 112566-7, 118591-9, 118601, 121512-3) are like\r\n_Crotalus pusillus_ from Cerro Tancitaro in having the prefrontals\r\npaired, a black proximal rattle, and the underside of the tail black.\r\nThe prefrontals are bordered posteriorly by one scale in two specimens,\r\nby two scales in three specimens, and by three scales in the other nine.\r\nThe snakes from the Sierra de Coalcoman have 40 to 46 (42) dorsal body\r\nblotches. Ten males have 150-158 (154.4) ventrals and 29-33 (31.0)\r\ncaudals; two females have 157 and 160 ventrals, and 25 and 27 caudals.\r\nThe largest specimen is a male having a body length of 545 mm. and a\r\ntail length of 63 mm. The only noticeable difference between the\r\nspecimens from the Sierra de Coalcoman and the topotypic series is that\r\nthe latter have fewer dorsal blotches; the range of variation is 33 to\r\n46 (39.8).\r\n\r\nMost specimens of this species have a grayish brown dorsum and dark\r\nbrown dorsal blotches. Two specimens from Dos Aguas (UMMZ 118596 and\r\n118599) are pale brown above and have indistinct blotches.\r\n\r\nOne specimen from Dos Aguas regurgitated a large _Gerrhonotus imbricatus\r\nimbricatus_; of two others from the same locality, one regurgitated a\r\n_Sceloporus bulleri_ and an _Eptesicus fuscus_. The latter specimen was\r\ncollected at the entrance of a small cave, where it probably had\r\ncaptured the bat.\r\n\r\nIn the Cordillera Volcanica _Crotalus pusillus_ has been obtained in\r\npine-oak forest at elevations between 1550 and 1800 meters. In the\r\nSierra de Coalcoman two specimens were taken in pine forest at an\r\nelevation of 2300 meters; ten other were found beneath rocks and logs in\r\npine-oak forest at an elevation of 2100 meters.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Crotalus triseriatus aquilus~ Klauber\r\n\r\n     _Crotalus triseriatus aquilus_ Klauber, Bull.

The distinguishing characters of these subspecies are\r\ngiven by Klauber (1952:28). On the basis of the few localities from\r\nwhich the species is known in Michoacan it seems as though _C. t.\r\naquilus_ inhabits the open grassy areas on the Mexican Plateau and the\r\nassociated open pine-oak or oak-bunch grass habitats to the north and\r\neast of the Cordillera Volcanica. _Crotalus triseriatus aquilus_ has\r\nbeen collected at elevations from 1600 to 2000 meters in Michoacan.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Crotalus triseriatus triseriatus~ (Wagler)\r\n\r\n     _Uropsophus triseriatus_ Wagler, Natuerliches System der\r\n     Amphibien, p. 176, 1830.--Mexico. (Probably Mexico City.)\r\n\r\n     _Crotalus triseriatus triseriatus_, Klauber, Bull. Zool.\r\n     Soc. San Diego, 26:19, August 8, 1952.\r\n\r\n     Cerro Tancitaro (36); Opopeo; Patzcuaro.\r\n\r\nThis small rattlesnake inhabits rocky areas in pine and pine-oak forests\r\nabove 1600 meters in the Cordillera Volcanica; it has been collected at\r\n3270 meters on Cerro Tancitaro. The series reported by Schmidt and\r\nShannon (1947:84) is a mixture of specimens of _Crotalus triseriatus_\r\nand _Crotalus pusillus_. The two species are found together on Cerro\r\nTancitaro, but only _Crotalus pusillus_ inhabits the coniferous forests\r\nof the Sierra de Coalcoman. Klauber (1952:30) stated that despite the\r\nproximity of _Crotalus triseriatus triseriatus_ and _Crotalus\r\ntriseriatus aquilus_ in Michoacan, there is no evidence of\r\nintergradation. He went on to suggest that additional material might\r\nshow that the two named populations actually are distinct species. The\r\nspecimens that have been studied since Klauber's investigations also\r\nshow no evidence of intergradation, but there still is no known sympatry\r\nof the populations.\r\n\r\nThe small montane rattlesnakes belonging to the species _C. pricei_, _C.\r\npusillus_, and _C. triseriatus_ present a problem in systematics and\r\ndistribution worthy of intensive investigation. A knowledge of the\r\ndistribution and relationships of the various populations of these\r\nsnakes, together with other species also living in isolated populations\r\non the higher mountains in Mexico, probably will be of great\r\nsignificance in understanding dispersal and differentiation of animals\r\nduring the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF QUESTIONABLE OCCURRENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome species for which there are no authentic records from Michoacan can\r\nbe expected there on zoogeographic probability. Other species have been\r\nrecorded from Michoacan, but these records are doubtful for any one of\r\nseveral reasons. Fifteen species of such questionable occurrence are\r\ndiscussed below:\r\n\r\n\r\n~Syrrhophus modestus modestus~ Taylor\r\n\r\n     _Syrrhophus modestus_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci.

Michigan, 594:5, June 6, 1958.\r\n\r\nThis small terrestrial frog is not uncommon on the coastal lowlands and\r\nfoothills in Nayarit and in Colima, where it has been collected within a\r\nfew kilometers of the Michoacan border. At Tecolapa, Colima, on August\r\n9, 1956, _Syrrhophus modestus modestus_ was found with _Tomodactylus\r\nnitidus orarius_, _Bufo marinus_, _Bufo marmoreus_, _Hyla baudini_,\r\n_Hyla smithi_, and _Phyllomedusa dacnicolor_, all of which occur on the\r\ncoastal lowlands of Michoacan. Because of its solitary and secretive\r\nhabits, _Syrrhophus modestus modestus_ is not common in collections.\r\nAdditional field work on the coast of Michoacan should reveal the\r\npresence of the species there.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hyla microcephala sartori~ Smith\r\n\r\n     _Hyla microcephala sartori_ Smith, Herpetologica, 7:186,\r\n     December 31, 1951.--1 mi. N of Organos, S of El Triente,\r\n     Guerrero, Mexico.\r\n\r\nOn August 28, 1960, J. R. Dixon obtained a series of this species from a\r\ntemporary pond 6 kilometers northeast of La Resolana, Jalisco.\r\nPreviously, _Hyla microcephala sartori_ had been known only from the\r\nlowlands of Guerrero and Oaxaca. The existence of the species in Jalisco\r\nprovides evidence that this frog also occurs in Michoacan and Colima.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Gastrophryne usta usta~ (Cope)\r\n\r\n     _Engystoma ustum_ Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,\r\n     18:131, 1866.--Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     _Gastrophryne usta usta_, Carvalho, Occ. Pap. Mus. Zool.\r\n     Univ. Michigan, 555:13, July 16, 1954.\r\n\r\nSmith and Taylor (1948:93-4) listed specimens of this species from\r\nOrganos and El Treinta, Guerrero, and from Paso del Rio, Queseria,\r\nSantiago, and Tecoman, Colima. The species occurs from Sinaloa and\r\ncentral Veracruz southward at low elevations to the Isthmus of\r\nTehuantepec and thence along the Pacific lowlands into Central America.\r\nAlmost certainly it occurs on the coastal lowlands in Michoacan. Since\r\nthe amphibian fauna of the Tepalcatepec Valley has been better sampled\r\nthan that of the coast, I suspect that if _Gastrophryne_ occurred in the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley, I would have found it there.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Lepidochelys olivacea~ (Eschscholtz)\r\n\r\n     _Chelonia olivacea_ Eschscholtz, Zool.

Although the only\r\nsea turtle that I observed in Michoacan is _Chelonia mydas_, others\r\nprobably do use the sheltered beaches for nesting. The scanty records of\r\nsea turtles along the Pacific coast of Mexico indicate that _Chelonia\r\nmydas_ and _Lepidochelys olivacea_ are the most abundant species in that\r\nregion. There are scattered records of _Dermochelys coriacea_, _Caretta\r\ncaretta_, and _Eretmochelys imbricata_ along the Pacific coast. The\r\noccurrence of any of these along the coast of Michoacan is probable.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Geoemyda pulcherrima pulcherrima~ (Gray)\r\n\r\n     _Emys pulcherrima_ Gray, Catalogue of the Shield Reptiles in\r\n     British Museum, vol. 1, p. 25.--Mexico.

Akad.\r\n     Wiss. Wien, 143:18, 1934.\r\n\r\nSmith and Taylor (1950b:30) recorded this species from Sonora, Sinaloa,\r\nNayarit, Colima, and Guerrero; these records indicate that the species\r\nprobably is distributed along the Pacific coast of Mexico southward from\r\nsouthern Sonora. It unquestionably occurs on the coast of Michoacan.\r\nNatives of the coastal lowlands tell of another \"tortuga de la tierra\"\r\nbesides _Geoemyda rubida_. In the collections of the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory of the University of Illinois is a specimen of _Geoemyda\r\npulcherrima_ from Mexcala in the Balsas Basin in northern Guerrero. On\r\nthe basis of this specimen it is highly probable that the species also\r\ninhabits the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin in Michoacan.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Pseudemys scripta ornata~ (Gray)\r\n\r\n     _Emys ornata_ Gray, Synopsis reptilium, p. 30,\r\n     1831.--Mazatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico.\r\n\r\n     _Pseudemys scripta ornata_, Carr, Herpetologica, 1:135,\r\n     December 30, 1938.\r\n\r\nThe systematics and distribution of _Pseudemys scripta_ in Mexico and\r\nCentral America are poorly understood. Smith and Taylor (1950b:32)\r\nrecorded this turtle from the Pacific lowlands of Sinaloa, Jalisco,\r\nOaxaca, and Chiapas. This species is represented by vicarious\r\npopulations throughout the Atlantic lowlands of Mexico, northwestern\r\nMexico, over much of the United States, and also in Baja California.\r\nAlong the Pacific coast of Mexico the species seems to be extremely\r\nrare, or, at least, only locally abundant. Since the species has such a\r\nwide distribution, and since it occurs on the Pacific lowlands both to\r\nthe north and to the south of Michoacan, it is reasonable to expect its\r\npresence on the coast of Michoacan. Inquiries among the natives living\r\nin the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin produced only negative evidence about\r\nthe occurrence of _Pseudemys_ in the Rio Tepalcatepec and Rio Balsas. I\r\nsuspect that the best place to search for these turtles on the coast of\r\nMichoacan is in the numerous fresh-water lagoons on the coastal plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Caiman crocodilus fuscus~ (Cope)\r\n\r\n     _Perosuchus fuscus_ Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.\r\n     Philadelphia, 20:203, November 9, 1868.--Rio Magdalena,\r\n     Columbia.\r\n\r\n     _Caiman crocodilus fuscus_, Mertens, Senckenbergiana,\r\n     26:275, December 22, 1943.\r\n\r\nGadow (1930:50) reported that _Caiman sclerops_ (= _Caiman crocodilus\r\nfuscus_) inhabited the \"tierra caliente\" in Michoacan. Smith and Taylor\r\n(1950b:212) accepted Gadow's record for the State, although otherwise\r\nthe species is unknown north of Oaxaca. Peters (1954:10) refuted Gadow's\r\nrecord on the basis that Gadow's collections contained no specimens of\r\n_Caiman_. The local name \"caiman\" refers to both _Crocodylus_ and to\r\n_Caiman_, for, in general, the natives do not distinguish between the\r\ntwo. \"Caimanes\" are reported from along the coast of Michoacan, where\r\nthe name presumably refers to _Crocodylus acutus acutus_, and in the\r\nBalsas-Tepalcatepec Basin (Gadow, 1930:50; Webber, 1946:267). I have\r\nseen no specimens of either _Crocodylus_ or _Caiman_ from the Balsas\r\nBasin. If crocodilians do occur in the basin, they probably are\r\n_Crocodylus acutus acutus_. There is no basis, whatsoever, for including\r\nMichoacan in the range of _Caiman crocodilus fuscus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Bipes canaliculatus~ Bonnaterre\r\n\r\n     _Bipes canaliculatus_ Bonnaterre, Encyclopedie methodique,\r\n     Erpetologie, p. 68, 1789.--Mexico. Type locality restricted\r\n     to Mexcala, Guerrero, Mexico, by Smith and Taylor\r\n     (1950b:39).\r\n\r\nDuges (1896:480) reported this species from Morelia, Michoacan. Smith\r\nand Taylor (1950b:39), who recorded the species from three localities in\r\nthe Balsas Basin in Guerrero, rejected Duges' record. I, too, am\r\nunwilling to accept Duges' record. Nevertheless, the species probably\r\noccurs throughout much of the Balsas Basin. This idea is strengthened by\r\ncomments made by Storm (1939:342): \"The last hard drop, that afternoon,\r\nwas down the great Cerro de los Cajones [southwest of Tacambaro], and\r\nhere in the upper forest we came upon... a lizard with front legs and\r\nnone behind ... the animal with hands and no feet that senor Smith\r\n[Hobart M. Smith] was seeking!... They're named _Bipes caniculatus_\r\n(_sic._).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Coleonyx elegans nemoralis~ Klauber\r\n\r\n     _Coleonyx elegans nemoralis_ Klauber, Trans.

Davis and Smith\r\n(1953:101) reported it from 8 kilometers northeast of Temilpa, Morelos,\r\nin the upper Balsas Basin. Specimens of this lizard have been collected\r\ninfrequently; the few locality records and limited ecological data\r\nindicate that it inhabits dense scrub forest and tropical semi-deciduous\r\nforest. _Coleonyx elegans nemoralis_ is to be expected on the coastal\r\nlowlands, the seaward foothills of the Sierra de Coalcoman, and on the\r\nlower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica along the northern edge of the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Phrynosoma orbiculare orbiculare~ (Linnaeus)\r\n\r\n     _Lacerta obricularis_ Linnaeus, Systema naturae, ed. 12,\r\n     1:1062, 1789.--Mexico (by inference).

There are no specimens\r\nof this species known from Gadow's collections made in Michoacan. Smith\r\nand Taylor (1950b:98) apparently accepted Gadow's statement and recorded\r\nthe species from Michoacan: \"above 3000 feet (Jorullo?).\" Reeve\r\n(1952:940) somehow misconstrued this statement to read \"Jorullo, above\r\nZumpango (Smith and Taylor, 1950b).\" Reeve did not indicate on his map\r\n(1952:939) that the species occurred in Michoacan. In the most recent\r\nreview of the species (Horowitz, 1955), no localities are given in\r\nMichoacan. Since _Phrynosoma orbiculare_ is known from central Jalisco,\r\nGuanajuato, Queretaro, and Mexico, its presence at least in northeastern\r\nMichoacan is to be expected, although at the present time there are no\r\nspecimens known from the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Eumeces brevirostris~ (Guenther)\r\n\r\n     _Mabouia brevirostris_ Guenther, Proc.

As presently recognized, this species contains two subspecies.\r\nOne of these occurs in the mountains of Oaxaca northward into central\r\nVeracruz; the other, _Eumeces brevirostris bilineatus_, occurs in\r\nDurango southward to Jalisco, where it inhabits the Sierra Madre\r\nOccidental.

Michoacan was included in the\r\nrange of the species by Taylor (1936:298) and by Smith and Taylor\r\n(1950b:164). The species definitely is known from southeastern Arizona\r\nsouthward to Guanajuato. It may occur in Michoacan, but, since there are\r\nthree rather widespread species of _Eumeces_ inhabiting the Mexican\r\nPlateau and associated mountain ranges in the northern and northeastern\r\npart of Michoacan, interspecific competition might be a reason for the\r\nabsence of _Eumeces callicephalus_ there.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta~ Guenther\r\n\r\n     _Leptodeira polysticta_ Guenther, Biologia\r\n     Centrali-Americana, Reptilia, p. 172, May, 1895.--Belice,\r\n     British Honduras.\r\n\r\n     _Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta_, Duellman, Bull.\r\n     Amer.

Smith and Taylor (1945:87) listed the species as\r\noccurring in Michoacan, but they had no record on which to base this\r\nreport.

Smith guessed\r\nthat the report was based on a specimen of _Micrurus fitzingeri_. The\r\nspecimen has not been seen. Although the species is known from\r\nGuanajuato and Mexico, until a specimen is available from Michoacan, the\r\nspecies should not be considered part of the herpetofauna of Michoacan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAZETTEER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe localities in Michoacan here listed are those from which specimens\r\nwere examined as well as other localities mentioned in the text. The\r\nlocalities are arranged alphabetically according to the most definitive\r\nword or words in the total name. For example, Lago de Chapala is listed\r\nas \"Chapala (Lago de)\" and Cerro de Tancitaro is listed as \"Tancitaro\r\n(Cerro de).\" Insofar as has been possible, the following information is\r\ngiven for each locality: geographical co-ordinates to the nearest minute\r\nof north latitude and west longitude, elevation in meters above mean sea\r\nlevel, a description of its geographical location, type of dominant\r\nvegetation, and in some cases comments concerning collecting sites in\r\nthe vicinity. Distances are in kilometers; all are map (air line)\r\ndistances, unless otherwise indicated. Many localities visited on mule\r\ntrips are given as being a certain number of \"mule hours\" in a general\r\ndirection from another town or village. In order to reach most of these\r\nlocalities today, one would have to go by mule, and this is the way the\r\nmuleteers determine their distances. Some of the elevations are taken\r\nfrom maps, but most of them were obtained from one or more readings of\r\naltimeters that we carried in the field. The terms used for describing\r\nthe vegetation are those defined in the section of the natural\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.

Ten species are reported for the first time from\r\nMichoacan: _Pseudoeurycea robertsi_, _Leptodactylus occidentalis_,\r\n_Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, _Pternohyla fodiens_, _Hypopachus\r\ncaprimimus_, _Phyllodactylus homolepidurus_, _Anolis dunni_, _Sceloporus\r\nbulleri_, _Sceloporus heterolepis,_ and _Geagras redimitus_. Five\r\nspecies that have been reported previously from Michoacan are based on\r\nspecimens having unreliable locality data or on misidentifications;\r\ntherefore, the following species are not considered to be a part of the\r\nherpetofauna of Michoacan: _Caiman crocodilus fuscus_, _Urosaurus\r\nirregularis_, _Geophis nasalis_, _Tropidodipsas fasciata guerreroensis_,\r\nand _Micrurus fitzingeri fitzingeri_.\r\n\r\nSystematic studies based at least in part on specimens from Michoacan\r\nhave resulted in a redefinition of nine species and subspecies: _Bufo\r\nmarmoreus_, _Bufo perplexus_, _Anolis nebulosus_, _Anolis nebuloides_,\r\n_Sceloporus bulleri_, _Sceloporus heterolepis_, _Sceloporus melanorhinus\r\ncalligaster_, _Hypsiglena torquata torquata_, and _Hypsiglena torquata\r\nochrorhyncha_.\r\n\r\nNine species that previously have been recognized as valid have been\r\nplaced in synonymy. These are: _Bufo horribilis_ Wiegmann, 1833, and\r\n_Bufo angustipes_ Smith and Taylor, 1945, as synonyms of _Bufo marinus_\r\n(Linnaeus), 1758. _Microbatrachylus albolabris_ Taylor, 1940,\r\n_Microbatrachylus minimus_ Taylor, 1940, and _Microbatrachylus imitator_\r\nTaylor, 1942, as synonyms of _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ (Taylor), 1937.\r\n_Phrynohyas corasterias_ Shannon and Humphrey, 1957, as a synonym of\r\n_Phrynohyas inflata_ (Taylor), 1944. _Hyla microeximia_ Maslin, 1957, as\r\na synonym of _Hyla eximia_ Baird, 1854. _Hylella azteca_ Taylor, 1943,\r\nas a synonym of _Hyla smaragdina_ Taylor, 1940. _Loxocemus sumichrasti_\r\nBocourt, 1876, as a synonym of _Loxocemus bicolor_ Cope, 1861.\r\n_Eleutherodactylus vocalis_ Taylor, 1940, is considered to be a\r\nsubspecies of _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_. The populations of\r\n_Thamnophis dorsalis_ in the Tepalcatepec Valley are shown to be\r\ndistinct from those inhabiting the highlands of the state; _Thamnophis\r\ndorsalis postremus_ Smith, 1942, is revived for the population in the\r\nTepalcatepec Valley.\r\n\r\nDescriptions are given of the tadpoles of _Bufo occidentalis_ and _Hyla\r\nbistincta_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.
