Shepard using the same\r\ntranslation of W. H. G. Kingston. English translators often altered\r\ntheir translations to suit current political views of Church and\r\nEmpire. In the Kingston translation the chapters near the end of the\r\nbook where Captain Nemo makes his appearance are altered beyond all\r\nrecognition and all mention of Captain Nemo’s previous life as a\r\n“freedom fighter” for Indian independence is removed, in addition to\r\nother deletions. The present translation is by the American Stephen W.\r\nWhite. It first appeared in the _Evening Telegraph_ of Philadelphia, PA\r\nand was later published as an Evening Telegraph Reprint Book (1876).\r\nThe present version is prepared from a xerox copy of that book kindly\r\nprovided by Mr. Sidney Kravitz of Dover, NJ. According to Taves and\r\nMichaluk “Although more faithful than any other translation, this one\r\nhas never been reprinted”. And so after a lapse of 127 years this\r\ntranslation of _The Mysterious Island_ is now again available to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nSince the text was hand set for a newspaper there are many printer’s\r\nerrors (including upside-down characters). Where obvious these have\r\nbeen corrected, although an attempt has been made to retain the\r\noriginal spelling of words in use at that period. Where there is a\r\ndoubt, words have been altered so that the spelling is consistent. In\r\nother cases, like “trajopan” where the inconsistency is traced to\r\nVerne’s original, the spelling is left unaltered. A table of contents\r\nbased on the chapter headings has been added which also indicates the\r\npoints at which the french version was divided into three parts. An\r\nupdated translation by Sidney Kravitz is now available from Wesleyan\r\nUniversity Press (2001).\r\n\r\n\r\nJULES VERNE’S LAST STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS

ISLAND.\r\n\r\nBy JULES VERNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\nSHIPWRECKED IN THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HURRICANE OF 1865—CRIES IN THE AIR—A BALLOON CAUGHT BY A\r\nWATERSPOUT—ONLY THE SEA IN SIGHT—FIVE PASSENGERS—WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THE\r\nBASKET—LAND AHEAD!—THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Are we going up again?”\r\n\r\n“No. On the contrary; we are going down!”\r\n\r\n“Worse than that, Mr. Smith, we are falling!”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake throw over all the ballast!”\r\n\r\n“The last sack is empty!”\r\n\r\n“And the balloon rises again?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“I hear the splashing waves!”\r\n\r\n“The sea is under us!”\r\n\r\n“It is not five hundred feet off!”\r\n\r\nThen a strong, clear voice shouted:—\r\n\r\n“Overboard with all we have, and God help us!”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words which rang through the air above the vast\r\nwilderness of the Pacific, towards 4 o’clock in the afternoon of the\r\n23d of March, 1865:—\r\n\r\nDoubtless, no one has forgotten that terrible northeast gale which\r\nvented its fury during the equinox of that year. It was a hurricane\r\nlasting without intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March.\r\nCovering a space of 1,800 miles, drawn obliquely to the equator,\r\nbetween the 35° of north latitude and 40° south, it occasioned immense\r\ndestruction both in America and Europe and Asia. Cities in ruins,\r\nforests uprooted, shores devastated by the mountains of water hurled\r\nupon them, hundreds of shipwrecks, large tracts of territory desolated\r\nby the waterspouts which destroyed everything in their path, thousands\r\nof persons crushed to the earth or engulfed in the sea; such were the\r\nwitnesses to its fury left behind by this terrible hurricane. It\r\nsurpassed in disaster those storms which ravaged Havana and Guadeloupe\r\nin 1810 and 1825.\r\n\r\nWhile these catastrophes were taking place upon the land and the sea, a\r\nscene not less thrilling was enacting in the disordered heavens.\r\n\r\nA balloon, caught in the whirl of a column of air, borne like a ball on\r\nthe summit of a waterspout, spinning around as in some aerial\r\nwhirlpool, rushed through space with a velocity of ninety miles an\r\nhour. Below the balloon, dimly visible through the dense vapor, mingled\r\nwith spray, which spread over the ocean, swung a basket containing five\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nFrom whence came this aerial traveller, the sport of the awful tempest?\r\nEvidently it could not have been launched during the storm, and the\r\nstorm had been raging five days, its symptoms manifesting themselves on\r\nthe 18th. It must, therefore, have come from a great distance, as it\r\ncould not have traversed less than 2,000 miles in twenty-four hours.\r\nThe passengers, indeed, had been unable to determine the course\r\ntraversed, as they had nothing with which to calculate their position;\r\nand it was a necessary effect, that, though borne along in the midst of\r\nthis tempest; they were unconscious of its violence. They were whirled\r\nand spun about and carried up and down without any sense of motion.\r\nTheir vision could not penetrate the thick fog massed together under\r\nthe balloon. Around them everything was obscure. The clouds were so\r\ndense that they could not tell the day from the night. No reflection of\r\nlight, no sound from the habitations of men, no roaring of the ocean\r\nhad penetrated that profound obscurity in which they were suspended\r\nduring their passage through the upper air. Only on their rapid descent\r\nhad they become conscious of the danger threatening them by the waves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the balloon, disencumbered of the heavy articles, such as\r\nmunitions, arms, and provisions, had risen to a height of 4,500 feet,\r\nand the passengers having discovered that the sea was beneath them, and\r\nrealizing that the dangers above were less formidable than those below,\r\ndid not hesitate to throw overboard everything, no matter how\r\nnecessary, at the same time endeavoring to lose none of that fluid, the\r\nsoul of the apparatus, which sustained them above the abyss.\r\n\r\nThe night passed in the midst of dangers that would have proved fatal\r\nto souls less courageous; and with the coming of day the hurricane\r\nshowed signs of abatement. At dawn, the emptied clouds rose high into\r\nthe heavens; and, in a few hours more, the whirlwind had spent its\r\nforce. The wind, from a hurricane, had subsided into what sailors would\r\ncall a “three reef breeze.”\r\n\r\nToward eleven o’clock, the lower strata of the air had lightened\r\nvisibly. The atmosphere exhaled that humidity which is noticeable after\r\nthe passage of great meteors. It did not seem as if the storm had moved\r\nwestward, but rather as if it was ended. Perhaps it had flowed off in\r\nelectric sheets after the whirlwind had spent itself, as is the case\r\nwith the typhoon in the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, however, it became evident that the balloon was again sinking\r\nslowly but surely. It seemed also as if it was gradually collapsing,\r\nand that its envelope was lengthening and passing from a spherical into\r\nan oval form. It held 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and therefore, whether\r\nsoaring to a great height or moving along horizontally, it was able to\r\nmaintain itself for a long time in the air. In this emergency the\r\nvoyagers threw overboard the remaining articles which weighed down the\r\nballoon, the few provisions they had kept, and everything they had in\r\ntheir pockets, while one of the party hoisted himself into the ring to\r\nwhich was fastened the cords of the net, and endeavored to closely tie\r\nthe lower end of the balloon. But it was evident that the gas was\r\nescaping, and that the voyagers could no longer keep the balloon\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\nThey were lost!\r\n\r\nThere was no land, not even an island, visible beneath them. The wide\r\nexpanse of ocean offered no point of rest, nothing upon which they\r\ncould cast anchor. It was a vast sea on which the waves were surging\r\nwith incomparable violence. It was the limitless ocean, limitless even\r\nto them from their commanding height. It was a liquid plain, lashed and\r\nbeaten by the hurricane, until it seemed like a circuit of tossing\r\nbillows, covered with a net-work of foam. Not even a ship was in sight.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to save themselves from being swallowed up by the\r\nwaves it was necessary to arrest this downward movement, let it cost\r\nwhat it might. And it was evidently to the accomplishment of this that\r\nthe party were directing their efforts. But in spite of all they could\r\ndo the balloon continued to descend, though at the same time moving\r\nrapidly along with the wind toward the southwest.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible situation, this, of these unfortunate men. No longer\r\nmasters of the balloon, their efforts availed them nothing. The\r\nenvelope collapsed more and more, and the gas continued to escape.\r\nFaster and faster they fell, until at 1 o’clock they were not more than\r\n600 feet above the sea. The gas poured out of a rent in the silk. By\r\nlightening the basket of everything the party had been able to continue\r\ntheir suspension in the air for several hours, but now the inevitable\r\ncatastrophe could only be delayed, and unless some land appeared before\r\nnightfall, voyagers, balloon, and basket must disappear beneath the\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that these men were strong and able to face death. Not a\r\nmurmur escaped their lips. They were determined to struggle to the last\r\nsecond to retard their fall, and they tried their last expedient. The\r\nbasket, constructed of willow osiers, could not float, and they had no\r\nmeans of supporting it on the surface of the water. It was 2 o’clock,\r\nand the balloon was only 400 feet above the waves.\r\n\r\nThen a voice was heard—the voice of a man whose heart knew no\r\nfear—responded to by others not less strong:—\r\n\r\n“Everything is thrown out?”\r\n\r\n“No, we yet have 10,000 francs in gold.”\r\n\r\nA heavy bag fell into the sea.\r\n\r\n“Does the balloon rise?”\r\n\r\n“A little, but it will soon fall again.”\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing else we can gut rid of?”\r\n\r\n“Not a thing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes there is; there’s the basket!”\r\n\r\n“Catch hold of the net then, and let it go.”\r\n\r\nThe cords which attached the basket to the hoop were cut, and the\r\nballoon, as the former fell into the sea, rose again 2,000 feet. This\r\nwas, indeed, the last means of lightening the apparatus. The five\r\npassengers had clambered into the net around the hoop, and, clinging to\r\nits meshes, looked into the abyss below.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the statical sensibility of a balloon. It is only\r\nnecessary to relieve it of the lightest object in order to have it\r\nrise. The apparatus floating in air acts like a mathematical balance.\r\nOne can readily understand, then, that when disencumbered of every\r\nweight relatively great, its upward movement will be sudden and\r\nconsiderable. It was thus in the present instance. But after remaining\r\npoised for a moment at its height, the balloon began to descend. It was\r\nimpossible to repair the rent, through which the gas was rushing, and\r\nthe men having done everything they could do, must look to God for\r\nsuccor.\r\n\r\nAt 4 o’clock, when the balloon was only 500 feet above the sea, the\r\nloud barking of a dog, holding itself crouched beside its master in the\r\nmeshes of the net, was heard.\r\n\r\n“Top has seen something!” cried one, and immediately afterwards another\r\nshouted:—\r\n\r\n“Land! Land!”\r\n\r\nThe balloon, which the wind had continued to carry towards the\r\nsouthwest, had since dawn passed over a distance of several hundred\r\nmiles, and a high land began to be distinguishable in that direction.\r\nBut it was still thirty miles to leeward, and even supposing they did\r\nnot drift, it would take a full hour to reach it. An hour! Before that\r\ntime could pass, would not the balloon be emptied of what gas remained?\r\nThis was the momentous question.\r\n\r\nThe party distinctly saw that solid point which they must reach at all\r\nhazards. They did not know whether it was an island or a continent, as\r\nthey were uninformed as to what part of the world the tempest had\r\nhurried them. But they knew that this land, whether inhabited or\r\ndesert, must be reached.\r\n\r\nAt 4 o’clock it was plain that the balloon could not sustain itself\r\nmuch longer. It grazed the surface of the sea, and the crests of the\r\nhigher waves several times lapped the base of the net, making it\r\nheavier; and, like a bird with a shot in its wing, could only half\r\nsustain itself.\r\n\r\nA half hour later, and the land was scarcely a mile distant. But the\r\nballoon, exhausted, flabby, hanging in wrinkles, with only a little gas\r\nremaining in its upper portion, unable to sustain the weight of those\r\nclinging to the net, was plunging them in the sea, which lashed them\r\nwith its furious billows. Occasionally the envelope of the balloon\r\nwould belly out, and the wind taking it would carry it along like a\r\nship. Perhaps by this means it would reach the shore. But when only two\r\ncables’ length away four voices joined in a terrible cry. The balloon,\r\nthough seemingly unable to rise again, after having been struck by a\r\ntremendous wave, made a bound into the air, as if it had been suddenly\r\nlightened of some of its weight. It rose 1,500 feet, and encountering a\r\nsort of eddy in the air, instead of being carried directly to land, it\r\nwas drawn along in a direction nearly parallel thereto. In a minute or\r\ntwo, however, it reapproached the shore in an oblique direction, and\r\nfell upon the sand above the reach of the breakers. The passengers,\r\nassisting each other, hastened to disengage themselves from the meshes\r\nof the net; and the balloon, relieved of their weight, was caught up by\r\nthe wind, and, like a wounded bird recovering for an instant,\r\ndisappeared into space.\r\n\r\nThe basket had contained five passengers and a dog, and but four had\r\nbeen thrown upon the shore. The fifth one, then, had been washed off by\r\nthe great wave which had struck the net, and it was owing to this\r\naccident that the lightened balloon had been able to rise for the last\r\ntime before falling upon the land. Scarcely had the four castaways felt\r\nthe ground beneath their feet than all thinking of the one who was\r\nlost, cried:—“Perhaps he is trying to swim ashore. Save him! Let us\r\nsave him!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EPISODE OF THE REBELLION-THE ENGINEER CYRUS SMITH—GIDEON SPILETT—THE\r\nNEGRO NEB—THE SAILOR PENCROFF—THE YOUTH, HERBERT—AN UNEXPECTED\r\nPROPOSAL—RENDEZVOUS AT 10 O’CLOCK P.M.—DEPARTURE IN THE STORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were neither professional aeronauts nor amateurs in aerial\r\nnavigation whom the storm had thrown upon this coast. They were\r\nprisoners of war whose audacity had suggested this extraordinary manner\r\nof escape. A hundred times they would have perished, a hundred times\r\ntheir torn balloon would have precipitated them into the abyss, had not\r\nProvidence preserved them for a strange destiny, and on the 20th of\r\nMarch, after having flown from Richmond, besieged by the troops of\r\nGeneral Ulysses Grant, they found themselves 7,000 miles from the\r\nVirginia capital, the principal stronghold of the Secessionists during\r\nthat terrible war. Their aerial voyage had lasted five days.\r\n\r\nLet us see by what curious circumstances this escape of prisoners was\r\neffected,—an escape which resulted in the catastrophe which we have\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThis same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of those\r\nsurprises by which General Grant, though in vain, endeavored to take\r\nRichmond, many of his officers were captured by the enemy and confined\r\nwithin the city. One of the most distinguished of those taken was a\r\nFederal staff officer named Cyrus Smith.\r\n\r\nCyrus Smith was a native of Massachusetts, an engineer by profession,\r\nand a scientist of the first order, to whom the Government had given,\r\nduring the war, the direction of the railways, which played such a\r\ngreat strategic part during the war.\r\n\r\nA true Yankee, thin, bony, lean, about forty-five years old, with\r\nstreaks of grey appearing in his close cut hair and heavy moustache. He\r\nhad one of those fine classical heads that seem as if made to be copied\r\nupon medals; bright eyes, a serious mouth, and the air of a practiced\r\nofficer. He was one of these engineers who began of his own wish with\r\nthe pick and shovel, as there are generals who have preferred to rise\r\nfrom the ranks. Thus, while possessing inventive genius, he had\r\nacquired manual dexterity, and his muscles showed remarkable firmness.\r\nHe was as much a man of action as of study; he moved without effort,\r\nunder the influence of a strong vitality and his sanguine temperament\r\ndefied all misfortune. Highly educated, practical, “clear-headed,” his\r\ntemperament was superb, and always retaining his presence of mind he\r\ncombined in the highest degree the three conditions whose union\r\nregulates the energy of man: activity of body, strength of will, and\r\ndetermination. His motto might have been that of William of Orange in\r\nthe XVIIth century—“I can undertake without hope, and persevere through\r\nfailure.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Smith was also the personification of courage. He had been in\r\nevery battle of the war. After having begun under General Grant, with\r\nthe Illinois volunteers, he had fought at Paducah, at Belmont, at\r\nPittsburg Landing, at the siege of Corinth, at Port Gibson, at the\r\nBlack River, at Chattanooga, at the Wilderness, upon the Potomac,\r\neverywhere with bravery, a soldier worthy of the General who said “I\r\nnever counted my dead.” And a hundred times Cyrus Smith would have been\r\namong the number of those whom the terrible Grant did not count; but in\r\nthese combats, though he never spared himself, fortune always favored\r\nhim, until the time he was wounded and taken prisoner at the siege of\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nAt the same time with Cyrus Smith another important personage fell into\r\nthe power of the Southerners. This was no other than the honorable\r\nGideon Spilett, reporter to the New York Herald, who had been detailed\r\nto follow the fortunes of the war with the armies of the North.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett was of the race of astonishing chroniclers, English or\r\nAmerican, such as Stanley and the like, who shrink from nothing in\r\ntheir endeavor to obtain exact information and to transmit it to their\r\njournal in the quickest manner. The journals of the United States, such\r\nas the New York _Herald_, are true powers, and their delegates are\r\npersons of importance. Gideon Spilett belonged in the first rank of\r\nthese representatives.\r\n\r\nA man of great merit; energetic, prompt, and ready; full of ideas,\r\nhaving been all over the world; soldier and artist; vehement in\r\ncouncil; resolute in action; thinking nothing of pain, fatigue, or\r\ndanger when seeking information, first for himself and afterwards for\r\nhis journal; a master of recondite information of the unpublished, the\r\nunknown, the impossible. He was one of those cool observers who write\r\namid the cannon balls, “reporting” under the bullets, and to whom all\r\nperils are welcome.\r\n\r\nHe also had been in all the battles, in the front rank, revolver in one\r\nhand and notebook in the other, his pencil never trembling in the midst\r\nof a cannonade. He did not tire the wires by incessant telegraphing,\r\nlike those who speak when they have nothing to say, but each of his\r\nmessages was short, condensed, clear, and to the purpose. For the rest,\r\nhe did not lack humor. It was he who, after the affair of Black river,\r\nwishing at any price to keep his place at the telegraph wicket in order\r\nto announce the result, kept telegraphing for two hours the first\r\nchapters of the Bible. It cost the New York _Herald_ $2,000, but the\r\nNew York _Herald_ had the first news.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett was tall. He was forty years old or more. Sandy-colored\r\nwhiskers encircled his face. His eye was clear, lively, and quick\r\nmoving. It was the eye of a man who was accustomed to take in\r\neverything at a glance. Strongly built, he was tempered by all climates\r\nas a bar of steel is tempered by cold water. For ten years Gideon\r\nSpilett had been connected with the New York _Herald_, which he had\r\nenriched with his notes and his drawings, as he wielded the pencil as\r\nwell as the pen. When captured he was about making a description and a\r\nsketch of the battle. The last words written in his note-book were\r\nthese:—“A Southerner is aiming at me and—.” And Gideon Spilett was\r\nmissed; so, following his invariable custom, he escaped unscratched.\r\n\r\nCyrus Smith and Gideon Spilett, who knew each other only by reputation,\r\nwere both taken to Richmond. The engineer recovered rapidly from his\r\nwound, and it was during his convalescence he met the reporter. The two\r\nsoon learned to appreciate each-other. Soon their one aim was to rejoin\r\nthe army of Grant and fight again in the ranks for the preservation of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nThe two Americans had decided to avail themselves of any chance; but\r\nalthough free to go and come within the city, Richmond was so closely\r\nguarded that an escape might be deemed impossible.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Cyrus Smith was rejoined by a devoted servant. This\r\nman was a negro, born upon the engineer’s estate, of slave parents,\r\nwhom Smith, an abolitionist by conviction, had long since freed. The\r\nnegro, though free, had no desire to leave his master, for whom he\r\nwould have given his life. He was a man of thirty years, vigorous,\r\nagile, adroit, intelligent, quick, and self-possessed, sometimes\r\ningenuous always smiling, ready and honest. He was named\r\nNebuchadnezzar, but he answered to the nickname of Neb.\r\n\r\nWhen Neb learned that his master had been taken prisoner he left\r\nMassachusetts without waiting a moment, arrived before Richmond, and,\r\nby a ruse, after having risked his life twenty times, he was able to\r\nget within the besieged city. The pleasure of Cyrus Smith on seeing\r\nagain his servant, and the joy of Neb in finding his master, cannot be\r\nexpressed. But while he had been able to get into Richmond it was much\r\nmore difficult to get out, as the watch kept upon the Federal prisoners\r\nwas very strict. It would require an extraordinary opportunity in order\r\nto attempt an escape with any chance of success; and that occasion not\r\nonly did not present itself, but it was difficult to make. Meanwhile,\r\nGrant continued his energetic operations. The victory of Petersburg had\r\nbeen vigorously contested. His forces, reunited to those of Butler, had\r\nnot as yet obtained any result before Richmond, and nothing indicated\r\nan early release to the prisoners. The reporter, whose tiresome\r\ncaptivity gave him no item worthy of note, grew impatient. He had but\r\none idea; to get out of Richmond at any risk. Many times, indeed, he\r\ntried the experiment, and was stopped by obstacles insurmountable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the siege continued, and as the prisoners were anxious to\r\nescape in order to join the army of Grant, so there were certain of the\r\nbesieged no less desirous to be free to join the army of the\r\nSecessionists; and among these was a certain Jonathan Forster, who was\r\na violent Southerner. In truth, the Confederates were no more able to\r\nget out of the city than the Federal prisoners, as the army of Grant\r\ninvested it around. The Mayor of Richmond had not for some time been\r\nable to communicate with General Lee, and it was of the highest\r\nimportance to make the latter aware of the situation of the city, in\r\norder to hasten the march of the rescuing army. This Jonathan Forster\r\nhad conceived the idea of passing over the lines of the besiegers in a\r\nballoon, and arriving by this means in the Confederate camp.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor authorized the undertaking, a balloon was made and placed at\r\nthe disposal of Forster and five of his companions. They were provided\r\nwith arms as they might have to defend themselves in descending, and\r\nfood in case their aerial voyage should be prolonged. The departure of\r\nthe balloon had been fixed for the 18th of March. It was to start in\r\nthe night, and with a moderate breeze from the northeast, the party\r\nexpected to arrive at the quarters of General Lee in a few hours. But\r\nthe wind from the northeast was not a mere breeze. On the morning of\r\nthe 18th there was every symptom of a storm, and soon the tempest broke\r\nforth, making it necessary for Forster to defer his departure, as it\r\nwas impossible to risk the balloon and those whom it would carry, to\r\nthe fury of the elements.\r\n\r\nThe balloon, inflated in the great square of Richmond, was all ready,\r\nwaiting for the first lull in the storm; and throughout the city there\r\nwas great vexation at the settled bad weather. The night of the 19th\r\nand 20th passed, but in the morning the storm was only developed in\r\nintensity, and departure was impossible.\r\n\r\nOn this day Cyrus Smith was accosted in one of the streets of Richmond\r\nby a man whom he did not know. It was a sailor named Pencroff, aged\r\nfrom thirty-five to forty years, strongly built, much sun-burnt, his\r\neyes bright and glittering, but with a good countenance.\r\n\r\nThis Pencroff was a Yankee who had sailed every sea, and who had\r\nexperienced every kind of extraordinary adventure that a two-legged\r\nbeing without wings could encounter. It is needless to say that he was\r\nof an adventurous nature, ready to dare anything and to be astonished\r\nat nothing. Pencroff, in the early part of this year, had come to\r\nRichmond on business, having with him Herbert Brown, of New Jersey, a\r\nlad fifteen years old, the son of Pencroff’s captain, and an orphan\r\nwhom he loved as his own child. Not having left the city at the\r\nbeginning of the siege, he found himself, to his great displeasure,\r\nblocked. He also had but one idea: to get out. He knew the reputation\r\nof the engineer, and he knew with what impatience that determined man\r\nchaffed at his restraint. He did not therefore hesitate to address him\r\nwithout ceremony.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith, have you had enough of Richmond?”\r\n\r\nThe engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke thus, and who added in\r\na low voice:—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith, do you want to escape?”\r\n\r\n“How?” answered the engineer, quickly, and it was evidently an\r\ninconsiderate reply, for he had not yet examined the man who spoke.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith, do you want to escape?”\r\n\r\n““Who are you?” he demanded, in a cold voice.\r\n\r\nPencroff made himself known.\r\n\r\n“Sufficient,” replied Smith. “And by what means do you propose to\r\nescape?”\r\n\r\n“By this idle balloon which is doing nothing, and seems to me all ready\r\nto take us!”—\r\n\r\nThe sailor had no need to finish his sentence. The engineer had\r\nunderstood all in a word. He seized Pencroff by the arm and hurried him\r\nto his house. There the sailor explained his project, which, in truth,\r\nwas simple enough:—They risked only their lives in carrying it out. The\r\nstorm was at its height, it is true; but a skilful and daring engineer\r\nlike Smith would know well how to manage a balloon. He, himself, would\r\nnot have hesitated to have started, had he known how—with Herbert, of\r\ncourse. He had seen many storms and he thought nothing of them.\r\n\r\nCyrus Smith listened to the sailor without saying a word, but with\r\nglistening eyes. This was the opportunity, and he was not the man to\r\nlet it escape him. The project was very dangerous, but it could be\r\naccomplished. During the night, in spite of the guards, they might\r\nreach the balloon, creep into the basket, and then cut the lines which\r\nheld it! Certainly they risked being shot, but on the other hand they\r\nmight succeed, and but for this tempest—but without this tempest the\r\nballoon would have been gone and the long-sought opportunity would not\r\nhave been present.\r\n\r\n“I am not alone,” said Smith at length.\r\n\r\n“How many would you want to take?” demanded the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Two; my friend Spilett, and my man Neb.”\r\n\r\n“That would be three,” replied Pencroff; “and, with Herbert and myself,\r\nfive. Well, the balloon can carry six?”\r\n\r\n“Very well. We will go!” said the engineer.\r\n\r\nThis “we” pledged the reporter, who was not a man to retreat, and who,\r\nwhen the project was told him, approved of it heartily. What astonished\r\nhim was, that so simple a plan had not already occurred to himself. As\r\nto Neb, he followed his master wherever his master wanted to go.\r\n\r\n“To-night, then,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“To-night, at ten o’clock,” replied Smith; “and pray heaven that this\r\nstorm does not abate before we get off.”\r\n\r\nPencroff took leave of the engineer, and returned to his lodging, where\r\nhe found young Herbert Brown. This brave boy knew the plans of the\r\nsailor, and he was not without a certain anxiety as to the result of\r\nthe proposal to the engineer. We see, therefore, five persons\r\ndetermined to throw themselves into the vortex of the storm.\r\n\r\nThe storm did not abate. And neither Jonathan Forster nor his companion\r\ndreamed of confronting it in that frail basket. The journey would be\r\nterrible. The engineer feared but one thing; that the balloon, held to\r\nthe ground and beaten down under the wind, would be torn into a\r\nthousand pieces. During many hours he wandered about the nearly\r\ndeserted square, watching the apparatus. Pencroff, his hands in his\r\npockets, yawning like a man who is unable to kill time, did the same;\r\nbut in reality he also feared that the balloon would be torn to pieces,\r\nor break from its moorings and be carried off.\r\n\r\nEvening arrived and the night closed in dark and threatening. Thick\r\nmasses of fog passed like clouds low down over the earth. Rain mingled\r\nwith snow fell. The weather was cold. A sort of mist enveloped\r\nRichmond. It seemed as if in the face of this terrible tempest a truce\r\nhad been agreed upon between the besiegers and besieged, and the cannon\r\nwere silent before the heavy detonations of the storm. The streets of\r\nthe city were deserted; it had not even seemed necessary, in such\r\nweather, to guard the square in which swung the balloon. Everything\r\nfavored the departure of the prisoners; but this voyage, in the midst\r\nof the excited elements!—\r\n\r\n“Bad weather,” said Pencroff, holding his hat, which the wind was\r\ntrying to take off, firmly to his head, “but pshaw, it can’t last, all\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\nAt half-past 9, Cyrus Smith and his companions glided by different\r\nroutes to the square, which the gas lights, extinguished by the wind,\r\nleft in profound darkness. They could not see even the huge balloon, as\r\nit lay pressed over against the ground. Beside the bags of ballast\r\nwhich held the cords of the net, the basket was held down by a strong\r\ncable passed through a ring fastened in the pavement, and the ends\r\nbrought back on board.\r\n\r\nThe five prisoners came together at the basket. They had not been\r\ndiscovered, and such was the darkness that they could not see each\r\nother. Without saying a word, four of them took their places in the\r\nbasket, while Pencroff, under the direction of the engineer, unfastened\r\nsuccessively the bundles of ballast. It took but a few moments, and\r\nthen the sailor joined his companions. The only thing that then held\r\nthe balloon was the loop of the cable, and Cyrus Smith had but to give\r\nthe word for them to let it slip. At that moment, a dog leaped with a\r\nbound into the basket. It was Top, the dog of the engineer, who, having\r\nbroken his chain, had followed his master. Cyrus Smith, fearing to add\r\nto the weight, wanted to send the poor brute back, but Pencroff said,\r\n“Pshaw, it is but one more!” and at the same time threw overboard two\r\nbags of sand. Then, slipping the cable, the balloon, shooting off in an\r\noblique direction, disappeared, after having dashed its basket against\r\ntwo chimneys, which it demolished in its rush.\r\n\r\nThen the storm burst upon them with frightful violence. The engineer\r\ndid not dare to descend during the night, and when day dawned all sight\r\nof the earth was hidden by the mists. It was not until five days later\r\nthat the breaking of the clouds enabled them to see the vast sea\r\nextending below them, lashed by the wind into a terrific fury.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, of these five men, who started on the 20th of March,\r\nfour were thrown, four days later, on a desert coast, more than 6,000\r\nmiles from this country. And the one who was missing, the one to whose\r\nrescue the four survivors had hurried was their leader, Cyrus Smith.\r\n\r\n[The 5th of April, Richmond fell into the hands of Grant, the Rebellion\r\nwas repressed, Lee retreated into the West (_sic_) and the cause of the\r\nUnion triumphed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE O’CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON—THE LOST ONE—THE DESPAIR OF NEB—SEARCH TO\r\nTHE NORTHWARD—THE ISLAND—A NIGHT OF ANGUISH—THE FOG OF THE MORNING—NEB\r\nSWIMMING—SIGHT OF THE LAND—FORDING THE CHANNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe engineer, on the giving way of the net, had been swept away by a\r\nwave. His dog had disappeared at the same time. The faithful animal had\r\nof its own accord sprung to the rescue of its master.\r\n\r\n“Forward!” cried the reporter, and all four, forgetting weakness and\r\nfatigue, began their search. Poor Neb wept with grief and despair at\r\nthe thought of having lost all that he loved in the world.\r\n\r\nNot more than two minutes had passed between the moment that Smith had\r\ndisappeared, and the instant of his companions landing. They were,\r\ntherefore, hopeful of being in time to rescue him.\r\n\r\n“Hunt, hunt for him,” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Neb, and we will find him,” replied Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Alive?”\r\n\r\n“Alive!”\r\n\r\n“Can he swim?” demanded Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” responded Neb. “And, besides, Top is with him—”\r\n\r\nThe sailor, looking at the roaring sea, shook his head.\r\n\r\nIt was at a point northward from this shore, and about half a mile from\r\nthe place where the castaways had landed, that the engineer had\r\ndisappeared, and if he had come ashore at the nearest point it was at\r\nleast that distance from where they now were.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly 6 o’clock. The fog had risen and made the night very\r\ndark. The castaways followed northward along the shore of that land\r\nupon which chance had thrown them. A land unknown, whose geographical\r\nsituation they could not guess. They walked upon a sandy soil, mixed\r\nwith stones, seemingly destitute of any kind of vegetation. The ground,\r\nvery uneven, seemed in certain places to be riddled with small holes,\r\nmaking the march very painful. From these holes, great, heavy-flying\r\nbirds rushed forth, and were lost in the darkness. Others, more active,\r\nrose in flocks, and fled away like the clouds. The sailor thought he\r\nrecognized gulls and sea-mews, whose sharp cries were audible above the\r\nraging of the sea.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the castaways would stop and call, listening for an\r\nanswering voice from the ocean. They thought, too, that if they were\r\nnear the place where the engineer had been, washed ashore, and he had\r\nbeen unable to make any response, that, at least, the barking of the\r\ndog Top would have been heard. But no sound was distinguishable above\r\nthe roaring of the waves and the thud of the surf. Then the little\r\nparty would resume their march, searching all the windings of the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nAfter a walk of twenty minutes the four castaways were suddenly stopped\r\nby a foaming line of breakers. They found themselves upon the extremity\r\nof a sharp point upon which the sea broke with fury.\r\n\r\n“This is a promontory,” said the sailor, “and it will be necessary to\r\nturn back, keeping to the right in order to gain the main land.”\r\n\r\n“But if he is there!” cried Neb, pointing towards the ocean, whose\r\nenormous waves showed white through the gloom.\r\n\r\n“Well, let us call again.”\r\n\r\nAnd all together, uniting their voices, uttered a vigorous cry, but\r\nwithout response. They waited for a lull, and tried once more. And\r\nagain there was no answer.\r\n\r\nThen the castaways turned back, following the opposite side of the\r\npromontory over ground equally sandy and rocky. However, Pencroff\r\nobserved that the shore was bolder, that the land rose somewhat, and he\r\nthought that it might gradually slope up to the high hill which was\r\ndimly visible through the darkness. The birds were less numerous on\r\nthis shore. The sea also seemed less surging and tempestuous, and it\r\nwas noticeable that the agitation of the waves was subsiding. They\r\nhardly heard the sound of the surf, and doubtless, this side of the\r\npromontory formed a semi-circular bay, protected by its sharp point\r\nfrom the long roll of the sea.\r\n\r\nBut by following this direction they were walking towards the south,\r\nwhich was going away from that place where Smith would have landed.\r\nAfter a tramp of a mile and a half, the shore presented no other curve\r\nwhich would permit of a return towards the north. It was evident that\r\nthis promontory, the point of which they had turned, must be joined to\r\nthe mainland. The castaways, although much fatigued, pushed on\r\ncourageously, hoping each moment to find a sudden turn which would take\r\nthem in the desired direction. What, then, was their disappointment\r\nwhen, after having walked nearly two miles, they found themselves again\r\narrested by the sea, upon a high promontory of slippery rocks.\r\n\r\n“We are on an island,” exclaimed Pencroff; “and we have measured it\r\nfrom end to end!”\r\n\r\nThe words of the sailor were true. The castaways had been thrown, not\r\nupon a continent, but upon an island not more than two miles long, and\r\nof inconsiderable breadth.\r\n\r\nThis desert isle, covered with stones, without vegetation, desolate\r\nrefuge of sea-birds, did it belong to a more important archipelago?\r\nThey could not tell. The party in the balloon, when from their basket\r\nthey saw the land through the clouds, had not been able to determine\r\nits size. But Pencroff, with the eyes of a sailor accustomed to\r\npiercing the gloom, thought, at the moment, that he could distinguish\r\nin the west confused masses, resembling a high coast. But at this time\r\nthey were unable, on account of the obscurity, to determine to what\r\nsystem, whether simple or complex, their isle belonged. They were\r\nunable to get off, as the sea surrounded them, and it was necessary to\r\nwait until the next day to search for the engineer; who, alas! had made\r\nno cry to signal his presence.\r\n\r\n“The silence of Cyrus proves nothing,” said the reporter. “He may have\r\nfainted, or be wounded, and unable to reply, but we will not despair.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter then suggested the idea of lighting a fire upon the point\r\nof the island, which would serve as a signal for the engineer. But they\r\nsearched in vain for wood or dry branches. Sand and stones were all\r\nthey found.\r\n\r\nOne can understand the grief of Neb and his companions, who were\r\nstrongly attached to their brave comrade. It was too evident that they\r\ncould not help him now, and that they must wait till day. The engineer\r\nhad escaped, and was already safe upon the land, or he was lost\r\nforever. The hours were long and dreadful, the cold was intense, and\r\nthe castaways suffered keenly, but they did not realize it. They did\r\nnot think of sleep. Thinking only of their chief, hoping, wishing to\r\nhope, they moved back and forth upon that arid island, constantly\r\nreturning to the northern end, where they would be closest to the place\r\nof the catastrophe. They listened, they shouted, they tried to catch\r\nsome call, and, as a lull would come, or the roar of the surf fall with\r\nthe waves, their hallooes must have sounded far into the distance.\r\n\r\nOnce the cry of Neb was answered by an echo; and Herbert made Pencroff\r\nnotice it, saying:—“That proves that there is land not far to the\r\nwest.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor nodded; he knew his eyes could not deceive him. He thought\r\nhe had seen land, and it must be there. But this distant echo was the\r\nonly answer to the cries of Neb, and the silence about the island\r\nremained unbroken. Meanwhile the sky was clearing slowly. Towards\r\nmidnight, some stars shone out, and, had the engineer been there with\r\nhis companions, he would have noticed that these stars did not belong\r\nto the northern hemisphere. The pole star was not visible in this new\r\nhorizon, the constellations in the zenith were not such as they had\r\nbeen accustomed to see from North America, and the Southern Cross shone\r\nresplendent in the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe night passed; and towards 5 o’clock in the morning the middle\r\nheavens began to brighten, though the horizon remained obscure; until\r\nwith the first rays of day, a fog rose from the sea, so dense that the\r\neye could scarcely penetrate twenty paces into its depths, and\r\nseparated into great, heavy-moving masses. This was unfortunate, as the\r\ncastaways were unable to distinguish anything about them. While the\r\ngaze of Neb and the reporter was directed towards the sea, the sailor\r\nand Herbert searched for the land in the west; but they could see\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Pencroff, “if I do not see the land. I feel that it\r\nis there,—just as sure as that we are not in Richmond.”\r\n\r\nBut the fog, which was nothing more than a morning mist, soon rose. A\r\nclear sun warmed the upper air, its heat penetrating to the surface of\r\nthe island. At half-past 6, three quarters of an hour after sunrise,\r\nthe mist was nearly gone. Though still thick overhead, it dissolved,\r\nbelow, and soon all the island appeared, as from a cloud. Then the sea\r\nappeared, limitless towards the east, but bounded on the west by a high\r\nand abrupt coast.\r\n\r\nYes, the land was there! There, safety was at least provisionally\r\nassured. The island and the main land were separated by a channel half\r\na mile wide, through which rushed a strong current. Into this current\r\none of the party, without saying a word or consulting with his\r\ncompanions, precipitated himself. It was Neb. He was anxious to be upon\r\nthat coast and to be pushing forward towards the north. No one could\r\nkeep him back. Pencroff called to him in vain. The reporter prepared to\r\nfollow, but the sailor ran to him, exclaiming:—\r\n\r\n“Are you determined to cross this channel?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” replied Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, listen to me a moment. Neb can rescue his master alone. If\r\nwe throw ourselves into the channel we are in danger of being carried\r\nout to sea by this strong current. Now, if I am not mistaken it is\r\ncaused by the ebb. You see the tide is going out. Have patience until\r\nlow water and then we may ford it.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” answered the reporter; “we will keep together as much\r\nas possible.”\r\n\r\nMeantime, Neb was swimming vigorously in a diagonal direction, against\r\nthe current; his black shoulders were seen rising with each stroke. He\r\nwas drawn backward with swiftness, but he was gaining towards the other\r\nshore. It took him more than half an hour to cross the half mile which\r\nseparated the isle from the mainland, and when he reached the other\r\nside it was at a place a long distance from the point opposite to that\r\nwhich he had left.\r\n\r\nNeb, having landed at the base of a high rocky wall, clambered quickly\r\nup its side, and, running, disappeared behind a point projecting into\r\nthe sea, about the same height as the northern end of the island.\r\n\r\nNeb’s companions had watched with anxiety his daring attempt, and, when\r\nhe was out of sight, they fixed their eyes upon that land from which\r\nthey were going to demand refuge. They ate some of the shellfish which\r\nthey found upon the sands; it was a poor meal, but then it was better\r\nthan nothing.\r\n\r\nThe opposite coast formed an immense bay, terminated to the south by a\r\nsharp point bare of all vegetation, and having a most forbidding\r\naspect. This point at its junction with the shore was abutted by high\r\ngranite rocks. Towards the north, on the contrary, the bay widened,\r\nwith a shore more rounded, extending from the southwest to the\r\nnortheast, and ending in a narrow cape. Between these two points, the\r\ndistance must have been about eight miles. A half mile from the shore\r\nthe island, like an enormous whale, lay upon the sea. Its width could\r\nnot have been greater than a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nBefore the Island, the shore began with a sandy beach strewn with black\r\nrocks, at this moment beginning to appear above the receding tide.\r\nBeyond this rose, like a curtain, a perpendicular granite wall, at\r\nleast 300 feet high and terminated by a ragged edge. This extended for\r\nabout three miles, ending abruptly on the right in a smooth face, as if\r\ncut by the hand of man. To the left on the contrary, above the\r\npromontory, this kind of irregular cliff, composed of heaped-up rocks\r\nand glistening in the light, sank and gradually mingled with the rocks\r\nof the southern point.\r\n\r\nUpon the upper level of the coast not a tree was visible. It was a\r\ntable-land, as barren though not as extensive as that around Cape Town,\r\nor at the Cape of Good Hope. At least so it appeared from the islet. To\r\nthe right, however, and back of the smooth face of rock, some verdure\r\nappeared. The confused massing of large trees was easily\r\ndistinguishable extending far as the eye could reach. This verdure\r\ngladdened the sight tired by the rough face of granite. Finally, back\r\nof and above the plateau, distant towards the northwest about seven\r\nmiles, shone a white summit, reflecting the sun’s rays. It was the\r\nsnowy cap of some lofty mountain.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible at present to say whether this land was an island\r\nor part of a continent; but the sight of the broken rocks heaped\r\ntogether on the left would have proved to a geologist their volcanic\r\norigin, as they were incontestably the result of igneous action.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett, Pencroff, and Herbert looked earnestly upon this land\r\nwhere they were to live, perhaps for long years; upon which, if out of\r\nthe track of ships, they might have to die.\r\n\r\n“Well,” demanded Herbert, “what do you think of it, Pencroff?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the sailor, “there’s good and bad in it, as with\r\neverything else. But we shall soon see; for look; what I told you. In\r\nthree hours we can cross, and once over there, we will see what we can\r\ndo towards finding Mr. Smith.”\r\n\r\nPencroff was not wrong in his predictions. Three hours later, at low\r\ntide, the greater part of the sandy bed of the channel was bare. A\r\nnarrow strip of water, easily crossed, was all that separated the\r\nisland from the shore. And at 10 o’clock, Spilett and his two\r\ncompanions, stripped of their clothing, which they carried in packages\r\non their heads, waded through the water, which was nowhere more than\r\nfive feet deep. Herbert, where the water was too deep, swam like a\r\nfish, acquitting himself well; and all arrived without difficulty at\r\nthe other shore. There, having dried themselves in the sun, they put on\r\ntheir clothes, which had not touched the water, and took counsel\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITHODOMES—THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER—THE “CHIMNEYS”—CONTINUATION OF\r\nTHE SEARCH—THE FOREST OF EVERGREENS—GETTING FIREWOOD—WAITING FOR THE\r\nTIDE—ON TOP OF THE CLIFF—THE TIMBER-FLOAT—THE RETURN TO THE COAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently the reporter told the sailor to wait just where he was until\r\nhe should come back, and without losing a moment, he walked back along\r\nthe coast in the direction which Neb had taken some hours before, and\r\ndisappeared quickly around a turn in the shore.\r\n\r\nHerbert wished to go with him.\r\n\r\n“Stay, my boy,” said the sailor. “We must pitch our camp for the night,\r\nand try to find something to eat more satisfying than shellfish. Our\r\nfriends will need food when they come back.”\r\n\r\n“I am ready, Pencroff,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the sailor. “Let us set to work methodically. We are\r\ntired, cold, and hungry: we need shelter, fire, and food. There is\r\nplenty of wood in the forest, and we can get eggs from the nests; but\r\nwe must find a house.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Herbert, “I will look for a cave in these rocks, and I\r\nshall certainly find some hole in which we can stow ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said Pencroff; “let us start at once.”\r\n\r\nThey walked along the base of the rocky wall, on the strand left bare\r\nby the receding waves. But instead of going northwards, they turned to\r\nthe south. Pencroff had noticed, some hundreds of feet below the place\r\nwhere they had been thrown ashore, a narrow inlet in the coast, which\r\nhe thought might be the mouth of a river or of a brook. Now it was\r\nimportant to pitch the camp in the neighborhood of fresh water; in that\r\npart of the island, too, Smith might be found.\r\n\r\nThe rock rose 300 feet, smooth and massive. It was a sturdy wall of the\r\nhardest granite, never corroded by the waves, and even at its base\r\nthere was no cleft which might serve as a temporary abode. About the\r\nsummit hovered a host of aquatic birds, mainly of the web-footed tribe,\r\nwith long, narrow, pointed beaks. Swift and noisy, they cared little\r\nfor the unaccustomed presence of man. A shot into the midst of the\r\nflock would have brought down a dozen; but neither Pencroff nor Herbert\r\nhad a gun. Besides, gulls and sea-mews are barely eatable, and their\r\neggs have a very disagreeable flavor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Herbert, who was now to the left, soon noticed some rocks\r\nthickly strewn with sea weed, which would evidently be submerged again\r\nin a few hours. On them lay hosts of bivalves, not to be disdained by\r\nhungry men. Herbert called to Pencroff, who came running to him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, they are mussels,” said the sailor. “Now we can spare the eggs.”\r\n\r\n“They are not mussels,” said Herbert, examining the mollusks carefully,\r\n“they are lithodomes.”\r\n\r\n“Can we eat them?” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us eat some lithodomes.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor could rely on Herbert, who was versed in Natural History and\r\nvery fond of it. He owed his acquaintance with this study in great part\r\nto his father, who had entered him in the classes of the best\r\nprofessors in Boston, where the child’s industry and intelligence had\r\nendeared him to all.\r\n\r\nThese lithodomes were oblong shell-fish, adhering in clusters to the\r\nrocks. They belonged to that species of boring mollusk which can\r\nperforate a hole in the hardest stone, and whose shell has the\r\npeculiarity of being rounded at both ends.\r\n\r\nPencroff and Herbert made a good meal of these lithodomes. which lay\r\ngaping in the sun. They tasted like oysters, with a peppery flavor\r\nwhich left no desire for condiments of any kind.\r\n\r\nTheir hunger was allayed for the moment, but their thirst was increased\r\nby the spicy flavor of the mollusks. The thing now was to find fresh\r\nwater, which was not likely to fail them in a region so undulating.\r\nPencroff and Herbert, after having taken the precaution to fill their\r\npockets and handkerchiefs with lithodomes, regained the foot of the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred feet further on they reached the inlet, through which, as\r\nPencroff had surmised, a little river was flowing with full current\r\nHere the rocky wall seemed to have been torn asunder by some volcanic\r\nconvulsion. At its base lay a little creek, running at an acute angle.\r\nThe water in this place was 100 feet across, while the banks on either\r\nside were scarcely 20 feet broad. The river buried itself at once\r\nbetween the two walls of granite, which began to decline as one went up\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n“Here is water,” said Pencroff, “and over there is wood. Well, Herbert,\r\nnow we only want the house.”\r\n\r\nThe river water was clear. The sailor knew that as the tide was now low\r\nthere would be no influx from the sea, and the water would be fresh.\r\nWhen this important point had been settled, Herbert looked for some\r\ncave which might give them shelter, but it was in vain. Everywhere the\r\nwall was smooth, flat, and perpendicular.\r\n\r\nHowever, over at the mouth of the watercourse, and above high-water\r\nmark, the detritus had formed, not a grotto, but a pile of enormous\r\nrocks, such as are often met with in granitic countries, and which are\r\ncalled _Chimneys_.\r\n\r\nPencroff and Herbert went down between the rocks, into those sandy\r\ncorridors, lighted only by the huge cracks between the masses of\r\ngranite, some of which only kept their equilibrium by a miracle. But\r\nwith the light the wind came in, and with the wind the piercing cold of\r\nthe outer air. Still, the sailor thought that by stopping up some of\r\nthese openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys might be\r\nrendered habitable. Their plan resembled the typographical sign, &, and\r\nby cutting off the upper curve of the sign, through which the south and\r\nthe west wind rushed in, they could succeed without doubt in utilizing\r\nits lower portion.\r\n\r\n“This is just what we want,” said Pencroff, and if we ever see Mr.\r\nSmith again, he will know how to take advantage of this labyrinth.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see him again, Pencroff,” said Herbert, “and when he comes\r\nback he must find here a home that is tolerably comfortable. We can\r\nmake this so if we can build a fireplace in the left corridor with an\r\nopening for the smoke.”\r\n\r\n“That we can do, my boy,” answered the sailor, “and these Chimneys will\r\njust serve our purpose. But first we must get together some firing.\r\nWood will be useful, too, in blocking up these great holes through\r\nwhich the wind whistles so shrilly.”\r\n\r\nHerbert and Pencroff left the Chimneys, and turning the angle, walked\r\nup the left bank of the river, whose current was strong enough to bring\r\ndown a quantity of dead wood. The return tide, which had already begun,\r\nwould certainly carry it in the ebb to a great distance. “Why not\r\nutilize this flux and reflux,” thought the sailor, “in the carriage of\r\nheavy timber?”\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of an hour’s walk, the two reached the elbow which the\r\nriver made in turning to the left. From this point onward it flowed\r\nthrough a forest of magnificent trees, which had preserved their\r\nverdure in spite of the season; for they belonged to that great\r\ncone-bearing family indigenous everywhere, from the poles to the\r\ntropics. Especially conspicuous were the “deodara,” so numerous in the\r\nHimalayas, with their pungent perfume. Among them were clusters of\r\npines, with tall trunks and spreading parasols of green. The ground was\r\nstrewn with fallen branches, so dry as to crackle under their feet.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the sailor, “I may not know the name of these trees, but I\r\nknow they belong to the genus firewood, and that’s the main thing for\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nIt was an easy matter to gather the firewood. They did not need even to\r\nstrip the trees; plenty of dead branches lay at their feet. This dry\r\nwood would burn rapidly, and they would need a large supply. How could\r\ntwo men carry such a load to the Chimneys? Herbert asked the question.\r\n\r\n“My boy,” said the sailor, “there’s a way to do everything. If we had a\r\ncar or a boat it would be too easy.”\r\n\r\n“We have the river,” suggested Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Pencroff. “The river shall be our road and our carrier,\r\ntoo. Timber-floats were not invented for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“But our carrier is going in the wrong direction,” said Herbert, “since\r\nthe tide is coming up from the sea.”\r\n\r\n“We have only to wait for the turn of tide,” answered the sailor. “Let\r\nus get our float ready.”\r\n\r\nThey walked towards the river, each carrying a heavy load of wood tied\r\nup in fagots. On the bank, too, lay quantities of dead boughs, among\r\ngrass which the foot of man had probably never pressed before. Pencroff\r\nbegan to get ready his float.\r\n\r\nIn an eddy caused by an angle of the shore, which broke the flow of the\r\ncurrent, they set afloat the larger pieces of wood, bound together by\r\nliana stems so as to form a sort of raft. On this raft they piled the\r\nrest of the wood, which would have been a load for twenty men. In an\r\nhour their work was finished, and the float was moored to the bank to\r\nwait for the turn of the tide. Pencroff and Herbert resolved to spend\r\nthe mean time in gaining a more extended view of the country from the\r\nhigher plateau. Two hundred feet behind the angle of the river, the\r\nwall terminating in irregular masses of rocks, sloped away gently to\r\nthe edge of the forest. The two easily climbed this natural staircase,\r\nsoon attained the summit, and posted themselves at the angle\r\noverlooking the mouth of the river.\r\n\r\nTheir first look was at that ocean over which they had been so\r\nfrightfully swept. They beheld with emotion the northern part of the\r\ncoast, the scene of the catastrophe, and of Smith’s disappearance. They\r\nhoped to see on the surface some wreck of the balloon to which a man\r\nmight cling. But the sea was a watery desert. The coast, too, was\r\ndesolate. Neither Neb nor the reporter could be seen.\r\n\r\n“Something tells me,” said Herbert, “that a person so energetic as Mr.\r\nSmith would not let himself be drowned like an ordinary man. He must\r\nhave got to shore; don’t you think so, Pencroff?”\r\n\r\nThe sailor shook his head sadly. He never thought to see Smith again;\r\nbut he left Herbert a hope.\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” said he, “our engineer could save himself where any one\r\nelse would perish.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he took a careful observation of the coast. Beneath his eyes\r\nstretched out the sandy beach, bounded, upon the right of the\r\nriver-mouth, by lines of breakers. The rocks which still were visible\r\nabove the water were like groups of amphibious monsters lying in the\r\nsurf. Beyond them the sea sparkled in the rays of the sun. A narrow\r\npoint terminated the southern horizon, and it was impossible to tell\r\nwhether the land stretched further in that direction, or whether it\r\ntrended southeast and southwest, so as to make an elongated peninsula.\r\nAt the northern end of the bay, the outline of the coast was continued\r\nto a great distance. There the shore was low and flat, without rocks,\r\nbut covered by great sandbanks, left by the receding tide.\r\n\r\nWhen Pencroff and Herbert walked back towards the west, their looks\r\nfell on the snowcapped mountain, which rose six or seven miles away.\r\nMasses of tree-trunks, with patches of evergreens, extended from its\r\nfirst declivities to within two miles of the coast. Then from the edge\r\nof this forest to the coast stretched a plateau strewn at random with\r\nclumps of trees. On the left shore through the glades the waters of the\r\nlittle river, which seemed to have returned in its sinuous course to\r\nthe mountains which gave it birth.\r\n\r\n“Are we upon an island?” muttered the sailor.\r\n\r\n“It is big enough, at all events,” said the boy.\r\n\r\n“An island’s an island, no matter how big,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\nBut this important question could not yet be decided. The country\r\nitself, isle or continent, seemed fertile, picturesque, and diversified\r\nin its products. For that they must be grateful. They returned along\r\nthe southern ridge of the granite plateau, outlined by a fringe of\r\nfantastic rocks, in whose cavities lived hundreds of birds. A whole\r\nflock of them soared aloft as Herbert jumped over the rocks.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried he, “these are neither gulls nor sea-mews.”\r\n\r\n“What are they?” said Pencroff. “They look for all the world like\r\npigeons.”\r\n\r\n“So they are,” said Herbert, “but they are wild pigeons, or rock\r\npigeons.” I know them by the two black bands on the wing, the white\r\nrump, and the ash-blue feathers. The rock pigeon is good to eat, and\r\nits eggs ought to be delicious; and if they have left a few in their\r\nnests—”\r\n\r\n“We will let them hatch in an omelet,” said Pencroff, gaily.\r\n\r\n“But what will you make your omelet in?” asked Herbert; “in your hat?”\r\n\r\n“I am not quite conjurer enough for that,” said the sailor. “We must\r\nfall back on eggs in the shell, and I will undertake to despatch the\r\nhardest.”\r\n\r\nPencroff and the boy examined carefully the cavities of the granite,\r\nand succeeded in discovering eggs in some of them. Some dozens were\r\ncollected in the sailor’s handkerchief, and, high tide approaching, the\r\ntwo went down again to the water-course.\r\n\r\nIt was 1 o’clock when they arrived at the elbow of the river, and the\r\ntide was already on the turn. Pencroff had no intention of letting his\r\ntimber float at random, nor did he wish to get on and steer it. But a\r\nsailor is never troubled in a matter of ropes or cordage, and Pencroff\r\nquickly twisted from the dry lianas a rope several fathoms long. This\r\nwas fastened behind the raft, and the sailor held it in his hand, while\r\nHerbert kept the float in the current by pushing it off from the shore\r\nwith a long pole.\r\n\r\nThis expedient proved an entire success. The enormous load of wood kept\r\nwell in the current. The banks were sheer, and there was no fear lest\r\nthe float should ground; before 2 o’clock they reached the mouth of the\r\nstream, a few feet from the Chimneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGING THE CHIMNEYS—THE IMPORTANT QUESTION OF FIRE—THE MATCH\r\nBOX—SEARCH OVER THE SHORE—RETURN OF THE REPORTER AND NEB—ONE MATCH—THE\r\nCRACKLING FIRE—THE FISH SUPPER—THE FIRST NIGHT ON LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first care of Pencroff, after the raft had been unloaded, was to\r\nmake the Chimneys habitable, by stopping up those passages traversed by\r\nthe draughts of air. Sand, stones, twisted branches, and mud,\r\nhermetically sealed the galleries of the & open to the southerly winds,\r\nand shut out its upper curve. One narrow, winding passage, opening on\r\nthe side; was arranged to carry out the smoke and to quicken the\r\ndraught of the fire. The Chimneys were thus divided into three or four\r\nchambers, if these dark dens, which would hardly have contained a\r\nbeast, might be so called. But they were dry, and one could stand up in\r\nthem, or at least in the principal one, which was in the centre. The\r\nfloor was covered with sand, and, everything considered, they could\r\nestablish themselves in this place while waiting for one better.\r\n\r\nWhile working, Herbert and Pencroff chatted together.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said the boy, “our companions will have found a better place\r\nthan ours.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible.” answered the sailor, “but, until we know, don’t let\r\nus stop. Better have two strings to one’s bow than none at all!”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” repeated Herbert, “if they can only find Mr. Smith, and bring him\r\nback with them, how thankful we will be!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” murmured Pencroff. “He was a good man.”\r\n\r\n“Was!” said Herbert. “Do you think we shall not see him again?”\r\n\r\n“Heaven forbid!” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe work of division was rapidly accomplished, and Pencroff declared\r\nhimself satisfied. “Now,” said he, “our friends may return, and they\r\nwill find a good enough shelter.”\r\n\r\nNothing remained but to fix the fireplace and to prepare the meal,\r\nwhich, in truth, was a task easy and simple enough. Large flat stones\r\nwere placed at the mouth of the first gallery to the left, where the\r\nsmoke passage had been made; and this chimney was made so narrow that\r\nbut little heat would escape up the flue, and the cavern would be\r\ncomfortably warmed. The stock of wood was piled up in one of the\r\nchambers, and the sailor placed some logs and broken branches upon the\r\nstones. He was occupied in arranging them when Herbert asked him if he\r\nhad some matches.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Pencroff, “and moreover, fortunately; for without\r\nmatches or tinder we would indeed be in trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Could not we always make fire as the savages do,” replied Herbert, “by\r\nrubbing two bits of dry wood together?”\r\n\r\n“Just try it, my boy, some time, and see if you do anything more than\r\nput your arms out of joint.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, it is often done in the islands of the Pacific.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t say that it is not,” replied Pencroff, “but the savages must\r\nhave a way of their own, or use a certain kind of wood, as more than\r\nonce I have wanted to get fire in that way and have never yet been able\r\nto. For my part, I prefer matches; and, by the way, where are mine?”\r\n\r\nPencroff, who was an habitual smoker, felt in his vest for the box,\r\nwhich he was never without, but, not finding it, he searched the\r\npockets of his trowsers, and to his profound amazement, it was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“This is an awkward business,” said he, looking at Herbert. “My box\r\nmust have fallen from my pocket, and I can’t find it. But you, Herbert,\r\nhave you nothing: no steel, not anything, with which we can make fire?”\r\n\r\n“Not a thing, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor, followed by the boy, walked out, rubbing his forehead.\r\n\r\nOn the sand, among the rocks, by the bank of the river, both of them\r\nsearched with the utmost care, but without result. The box was of\r\ncopper, and had it been there, they must have seen it.\r\n\r\n“Pencroff,” asked Herbert, “did not you throw it out of the basket?”\r\n\r\n“I took good care not to,” said the sailor. “But when one has been\r\nknocked around as we have been, so small a thing could easily have been\r\nlost; even my pipe is gone. The confounded box; where can it be?”\r\n\r\n“Well, the tide is out; let us run to the place where we landed,” said\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\nIt was little likely that they would find this box, which the sea would\r\nhave rolled among the pebbles at high water; nevertheless, it would do\r\nno harm to search. They, therefore, went quickly to the place where\r\nthey had first landed, some 200 paces from the Chimneys. There, among\r\nthe pebbles, in the hollows of the rocks, they made minute search, but\r\nin vain. If the box had fallen here it must have been carried out by\r\nthe waves. As the tide went down, the sailor peered into every crevice,\r\nbut without Success. It was a serious loss, and, for the time,\r\nirreparable. Pencroff did not conceal his chagrin. He frowned, but did\r\nnot speak, and Herbert tried to console him by saying, that, most\r\nprobably, the matches would have been so wetted as to be useless.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy,” answered the sailor. “They were in a tightly closing\r\nmetal box. But now, what are we to do?”\r\n\r\n“We will certainly find means of procuring fire,” said Herbert. “Mr.\r\nSmith or Mr. Spilett will not be as helpless as we are.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but in the meantime we are without it,” said Pencroff, “and our\r\ncompanions will find but a very sorry meal on their return.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Herbert, hopefully, “it is not possible that they will have\r\nneither tinder nor matches.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt it,” answered the sailor, shaking his head. “In the first\r\nplace, neither Neb nor Mr. Smith smoke, and then I’m afraid Mr. Spilett\r\nhas more likely kept his notebook than his match-box.”\r\n\r\nHerbert did not answer. This loss was evidently serious. Nevertheless,\r\nthe lad thought surely they could make a fire in some way or other, but\r\nPencroff, more experienced, although a man not easily discouraged, knew\r\ndifferently. At any rate there was but one thing to do:—to wait until\r\nthe return of Neb and the reporter. It was necessary to give up the\r\nrepast of cooked eggs which they had wished to prepare, and a diet of\r\nraw flesh did not seem to be, either for themselves or for the others,\r\nan agreeable prospect.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to the Chimneys, the companions, in case they failed\r\nof a fire, gathered a fresh lot of lithodomes, and then silently took\r\nthe road to their dwelling. Pencroff, his eyes fixed upon the ground,\r\nstill searched in every direction for the lost box. They followed again\r\nup the left bank of the river, from its mouth to the angle where the\r\nraft had been built. They returned to the upper plateau, and went in\r\nevery direction, searching in the tall grass on the edge of the forest,\r\nbut in vain. It was 5 o’clock when they returned again to the Chimneys,\r\nand it is needless to say that the passages were searched in their\r\ndarkest recesses before all hope was given up.\r\n\r\nTowards 6 o’clock, just as the sun was disappearing behind the high\r\nland in the west, Herbert, who was walking back and forth upon the\r\nshore, announced the return of Neb and of Gideon Spilett. They came\r\nback alone, and the lad felt his heart sink. The sailor had not, then,\r\nbeen wrong in his presentiments; they had been unable to find the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nThe reporter, when he came up, seated himself upon a rock, without\r\nspeaking. Fainting from fatigue, half dead with hunger, he was unable\r\nto utter a word. As to Neb, his reddened eyes showed how he had been\r\nweeping, and the fresh tears which he was unable to restrain,\r\nindicated, but too clearly, that he had lost all hope.\r\n\r\nThe reporter at length gave the history of their search. Neb and he had\r\nfollowed the coast for more than eight miles, and, consequently, far\r\nbeyond the point where the balloon had made the plunge which was\r\nfollowed by the disappearance of the engineer and Top. The shore was\r\ndeserted. Not a recently turned stone, not a trace upon the sand, not a\r\nfootprint, was upon all that part of the shore. It was evident that\r\nnobody inhabited that portion of the island. The sea was as deserted as\r\nthe land; and it was there, at some hundreds of feet from shore, that\r\nthe engineer had found his grave.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Neb raised his head, and in a voice which showed how he\r\nstill struggled against despair, exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“No, he is not dead. It is impossible. It might happen to you or me,\r\nbut never to him. He is a man who can get out of anything!”\r\n\r\nThen his strength failing him, he murmured, “But I am used up.”\r\n\r\nHerbert ran to him and cried:—\r\n\r\n“Neb, we will find him; God will give him back to us; but you, you must\r\nbe famishing; do eat something.”\r\n\r\nAnd while speaking the lad offered the poor negro a handful of\r\nshell-fish—a meagre and insufficient nourishment enough.\r\n\r\nBut Neb, though he had eaten nothing for hours, refused them. Poor\r\nfellow! deprived of his master, he wished no longer to live.\r\n\r\nAs to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the mollusks, and then laid down upon\r\nthe sand at the foot of a rock. He was exhausted, but calm. Herbert,\r\napproaching him, took his hand.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Spilett,” said he, “we have discovered a shelter where you will be\r\nmore comfortable. The night is coming on; so come and rest there.\r\nTo-morrow we will see—”\r\n\r\nThe reporter rose, and, guided by the lad, proceeded towards the\r\nChimneys. As he did so, Pencroff came up to him, and in an off-hand way\r\nasked him if, by chance, he had a match with him. The reporter stopped,\r\nfelt in his pockets, and finding none, said:—\r\n\r\n“I had some, but I must have thrown them all away.”\r\n\r\nThen the sailor called Neb and asked him the same question, receiving a\r\nlike answer.\r\n\r\n“Curse it!” cried the sailor, unable to restrain the word.\r\n\r\nThe reporter heard it, and going to him said:—“Have you no matches?”\r\n\r\n“Not one; and, of course, no fire.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” cried Neb, “if he was here, my master, he could soon make one.”\r\n\r\nThe four castaways stood still and looked anxiously at each other.\r\nHerbert was the first to break the silence, by saying:—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Spilett, you are a smoker, you always have matches about you;\r\nperhaps you have not searched thoroughly. Look again; a single match\r\nwill be enough.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter rummaged the pockets of his trowsers, his vest, and coat,\r\nand to the great joy of Pencroff, as well as to his own surprise, felt\r\na little sliver of wood caught in the lining of his vest. He could feel\r\nit from the outside, but his fingers were unable to disengage it. If\r\nthis should prove a match, and only one, it was extremely necessary not\r\nto rub off the phosphorus.\r\n\r\n“Let me try,” said the lad. And very adroitly, without breaking it, he\r\ndrew out this little bit of wood, this precious trifle, which to these\r\npoor men was of such great importance. It was uninjured.\r\n\r\n“One match!” cried Pencroff.” “Why, it is as good as if we had a whole\r\nship-load!”\r\n\r\nHe took it, and, followed by his companions, regained the Chimneys.\r\nThis tiny bit of wood, which in civilised lands is wasted with\r\nindifference, as valueless, it was necessary here to use with the\r\nutmost care. The sailor, having assured himself that it was dry, said:—\r\n\r\n“We must have some paper.”\r\n\r\n“Here is some,” answered Spilett, who, after a little hesitation, had\r\ntorn a leaf from his note-book.\r\n\r\nPencroff took the bit of paper and knelt down before the fire-place,\r\nwhere some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry moss had been placed\r\nunder the faggots in such a way that the air could freely circulate and\r\nmake the dry wood readily ignite. Then Pencroff shaping the paper into\r\na cone, as pipe-smokers do in the wind, placed it among the moss.\r\nTaking, then, a slightly rough stone and wiping it carefully, with\r\nbeating heart and suspended breath, he gave the match a little rub. The\r\nfirst stroke produced no effect, as Pencroff fearing to break off the\r\nphosphorus had not rubbed hard enough.\r\n\r\n“Ho, I won’t be able to do it,” said he; “my hand shakes—the match will\r\nmiss—I can’t do it—I don’t want to try!” And, rising, he besought\r\nHerbert to undertake it.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the boy had never in his life been so affected. His heart\r\nbeat furiously. Prometheus, about to steal the fire from heaven, could\r\nnot have been more excited.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he did not hesitate, but rubbed the stone with a quick\r\nstroke. A little sputtering was heard, and a light blue flame sprung\r\nout and produced a pungent smoke. Herbert gently turned the match, so\r\nas to feed the flame, and then slid it under the paper cone. In a few\r\nseconds the paper took fire, and then the moss kindled. An instant\r\nlater, the dry wood crackled, and a joyous blaze, fanned by the breath\r\nof the sailor, shone out from the darkness.\r\n\r\n“At length,” cried Pencroff, rising, “I never was so excited in my\r\nlife!”\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the fire did well in the fireplace of flat stones.\r\nThe smoke readily ascended through its passage; the chimney drew, and\r\nan agreeable warmth quickly made itself felt. As to the fire, it would\r\nbe necessary to take care that it should not go out, and always to keep\r\nsome embers among the cinders. But it was only a matter of care and\r\nattention as the wood was plenty, and the supply could always be\r\nrenewed in good time.\r\n\r\nPencroff began at once to utilize the fire by preparing something more\r\nnourishing than a dish of lithodomes. Two dozen eggs were brought by\r\nHerbert, and the reporter, seated in a corner, watched these\r\nproceedings without speaking. A triple thought held possession of his\r\nmind. Did Cyrus still live? If alive, where was he? If he had survived\r\nhis plunge, why was it he had found no means of making his existence\r\nknown? As to Neb, he roamed the sand like one distracted.\r\n\r\nPencroff, who knew fifty-two ways of cooking eggs, had no choice at\r\nthis time. He contented himself with placing them in the hot cinders\r\nand letting them cook slowly. In a few minutes the operation was\r\nfinished, and the sailor invited the reporter to take part in the\r\nsupper. This was the first meal of the castaways upon this unknown\r\ncoast. The hard eggs were excellent, and as the egg contains all the\r\nelements necessary for man’s nourishment, these poor men found them\r\nsufficient, and felt their strength reviving.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one was absent from this repast. If the five prisoners\r\nwho had escaped from Richmond had all been there, under those piled-up\r\nrocks, before that bright and crackling fire upon that dry sand, their\r\nhappiness would have been complete. But the most ingenious, as well as\r\nthe most learned—he who was undoubtedly their chief, Cyrus Smith—alas!\r\nwas missing, and his body had not even obtained burial.\r\n\r\nThus passed the 25th of March. The night was come. Outside they heard\r\nthe whistling of the wind, the monotonous thud of the surf, and the\r\ngrinding of the pebbles on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe reporter had retired to a dark corner, after having briefly noted\r\nthe events of the day—the first sight of this new land, the loss of the\r\nengineer, the exploration of the shore, the incidents of the matches,\r\netc.; and, overcome by fatigue, he was enabled to find some rest in\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nHerbert fell asleep at once. The sailor, dozing, with one eye open,\r\npassed the night by the fire, on which he kept heaping fuel.\r\n\r\nOne only of the castaways did not rest in the Chimneys. It was the\r\ninconsolable, the despairing Neb, who, during the whole night, and in\r\nspite of his companions’ efforts to make him take some rest, wandered\r\nupon the sands calling his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASTAWAYS’ INVENTORY—NO EFFECTS —THE CHARRED LINEN—AN EXPEDITION\r\nINTO THE FOREST—THE FLORA OF THE WOODS—THE FLIGHT OF THE JACAMAR—TRACKS\r\nOF WILD BEASTS—THE COUROUCOUS—THE HEATH-COCK—LINE-FISHING\r\nEXTRAORDINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inventory of the castaways can be promptly taken. Thrown upon a\r\ndesert coast, they had nothing but the clothes they wore in the\r\nballoon. We must add Spilett’s watch and note-book, which he had kept\r\nby some inadvertence; but there were no firearms and no tools, not even\r\na pocket knife. Every thing had been thrown overboard to lighten the\r\nballoon. Every necessary of life was wanting!\r\n\r\nYet if Cyrus Smith had been with them, his practical science and\r\ninventive genius would have saved them from despair. But, alas! they\r\ncould hope to see him no more. The castaways could rely on Providence\r\nonly, and on their own right hands.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, should they settle down on this strip of coast without an\r\neffort to discover whether it was island or continent, inhabited or\r\ndesert? It was an urgent question, for all their measures would depend\r\nupon its solution. However, it seemed to Pencroff better to wait a few\r\ndays before undertaking an exploration. They must try to procure more\r\nsatisfying food than eggs and shellfish, and repair their strength,\r\nexhausted by fatigue and by the inclemency of the weather. The Chimneys\r\nwould serve as a house for a while. Their fire was lit, and it would be\r\neasy to keep alive some embers. For the time being there were plenty of\r\neggs and shell-fish. They might even be able to kill, with a stick or a\r\nstone, some of the numerous pigeons which fluttered among the rocks.\r\nThey might find fruit-trees in the neighboring forest, and they had\r\nplenty of fresh water. It was decided then to wait a few days at the\r\nChimneys, and to prepare for an expedition either along the coast or\r\ninto the interior of the country.\r\n\r\nThis plan was especially agreeable to Neb, who was in no hurry to\r\nabandon that part of the coast which had been the scene of the\r\ncatastrophe. He could not and would not believe that Smith was dead.\r\nUntil the waves should have thrown up the engineer’s body—until Neb\r\nshould have seen with his eyes and handled with his hands his master’s\r\ncorpse, he believed him alive. It was an illusion which the sailor had\r\nnot the heart to destroy; and there was no use in talking to Neb. He\r\nwas like the dog who would not leave his master’s tomb, and his grief\r\nwas such that he would probably soon follow him.\r\n\r\nUpon the morning of the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb started along\r\nthe coast northward to the spot where the sea had doubtless closed over\r\nthe unfortunate engineer.\r\n\r\nFor breakfast that morning they had only eggs and lithodomes, seasoned\r\nwith salt which Herbert had found in the cavities of the rocks. When\r\nthe meal was over they divided forces. The reporter stayed behind to\r\nkeep up the fire, and in the very improbable case of Neb’s needing him\r\nto go to his assistance. Herbert and Pencroff went into the forest.\r\n\r\n“We will go hunting, Herbert, “said the sailor. “We shall find\r\nammunition on our way, and we will cut our guns in the forest.”\r\n\r\nBut, before starting, Herbert suggested that as they had no tinder they\r\nmust replace it by burnt linen. They were sorry to sacrifice a piece of\r\nhandkerchief, but the need was urgent, and a piece of Pencroff’s large\r\ncheck handkerchief was soon converted into a charred rag, and put away\r\nin the central chamber in a little cavity of the rock, sheltered from\r\nwind and dampness.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was 9 o’clock. The weather was threatening and the\r\nbreeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroff, as they left the\r\nChimneys, cast a glance at the smoke which curled upwards from amid the\r\nrocks; then they walked up the left bank of the river.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the forest, Pencroff broke from the first tree two\r\nthick branches which he made into cudgels, and whose points Herbert\r\nblunted against a rock. What would he not have given for a knife? Then\r\nthe hunters walked on in the high grass along the bank of the river,\r\nwhich, after its turn to the southwest, gradually narrowed, running\r\nbetween high banks and over-arched by interlacing trees. Pencroff, not\r\nto lose his way, determined to follow the course of the stream, which\r\nwould bring him back to his point of departure. But the bank offered\r\nmany obstacles. Here, trees whose flexible branches bent over to the\r\nbrink of the current; there, thorns and lianas which they had to break\r\nwith their sticks. Herbert often glided between the broken stumps with\r\nthe agility of a young cat and disappeared in the copse, but Pencroff\r\ncalled him back at once, begging him not to wander away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the sailor carefully observed the character and\r\npeculiarities of the region. On this left bank the surface was flat,\r\nrising insensibly towards the interior. Sometimes it was moist and\r\nswampy, indicating the existence of a subterranean network of little\r\nstreams emptying themselves into the river. Sometimes, too, a brook ran\r\nacross the copse, which they crossed without trouble. The opposite bank\r\nwas more undulating, and the valley, through whose bottom flowed the\r\nriver, was more clearly defined. The hill, covered with trees rising in\r\nterraces, intercepted the vision. Along this right bank they could\r\nhardly have walked, for the descent was steep, and the trees which bent\r\nover the water were only sustained by their roots. It is needless to\r\nsay that both forest and shore seemed a virgin wilderness. They saw\r\nfresh traces of animals whose species was unknown to them. Some seemed\r\nto them the tracks of dangerous wild beasts, but nowhere was there the\r\nmark of an axe on a tree-trunk, or the ashes of a fire, or the imprint\r\nof a foot. They should no doubt have been glad that it was so, for on\r\nthis land in the mid-Pacific, the presence of man was a thing more to\r\nbe dreaded than desired.\r\n\r\nThey hardly spoke, so great were the difficulties of the route; after\r\nan hour’s walk they had but just compassed a mile. Hitherto their\r\nhunting had been fruitless. Birds were singing and flying to and fro\r\nunder the trees; but they showed an instinctive fear of their enemy\r\nman. Herbert descried among them, in a swampy part of the forest, a\r\nbird with narrow and elongated beak, in shape something like a\r\nkingfisher, from which it was distinguished by its harsh and lustrous\r\nplumage.\r\n\r\n“That must be a jacamar,” said Herbert, trying to get within range of\r\nthe bird.\r\n\r\n“It would be a good chance to taste jacamar,” answered the sailor, “if\r\nthat fellow would only let himself be roasted.”\r\n\r\nIn a moment a stone, adroitly aimed by the boy, struck the bird on the\r\nwing; but the jacamar took to his legs and disappeared in a minute.\r\n\r\n“What a muff I am,” said Herbert. ‘Not at all,” said the sailor. “It\r\nwas a good shot, a great many would have missed the bird. Don’t be\r\ndiscouraged, we’ll catch him again some day.”\r\n\r\nThe wood opened as the hunters went on, and the trees grew to a vast\r\nheight, but none had edible fruits. Pencroff sought in vain for some of\r\nthose precious palm trees, which lend themselves so wonderfully to the\r\nneeds of mankind, and which grow from 40° north latitude to 35° south.\r\nBut this forest was composed only of conifers, such as the deodars,\r\nalready recognized by Herbert; the Douglas pines, which grow on the\r\nnortheast coast of America; and magnificent fir trees, 150 feet high.\r\nAmong their branches was fluttering a flock of birds, with small bodies\r\nand long, glittering tails. Herbert picked up some of the feathers,\r\nwhich lay scattered on the ground, and looked at them carefully.\r\n\r\n“These are ‘couroucous,’“ said he.\r\n\r\n“I would rather have a guinea-hen, or a heath-cock,” said Pencroff,\r\n“but still, if they are good to eat”—\r\n\r\n“They are good to eat,” said Herbert; “their meat is delicious.\r\nBesides, I think we can easily get at them with our sticks.”\r\n\r\nSlipping through the grass, they reached the foot of a tree whose lower\r\nbranches were covered with the little birds, who were snapping at the\r\nflying insects. Their feathered claws clutched tight the twigs on which\r\nthey were sitting. Then the hunters rose to their feet, and using their\r\nsticks like a scythe, they mowed down whole rows of the couroucous, of\r\nwhom 105 were knocked over before the stupid birds thought of escape.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Pencroff, “this is just the sort of game for hunters like\r\nus. We could catch them in our hands.”\r\n\r\nThey skewered the couroucous on a switch like field-larks, and\r\ncontinued to explore. The object of the expedition was, of course, to\r\nbring back as much game as possible to the Chimneys. So far it had not\r\nbeen altogether attained. They looked about everywhere, and were\r\nenraged to see animals escaping through the high grass. If they had\r\nonly had Top! But Top, most likely, had perished with his master.\r\n\r\nAbout 3 o’clock they entered a wood full of juniper trees, at whose\r\naromatic berries flocks of birds were pecking. Suddenly they heard a\r\nsound like the blast of a trumpet. It was the note of those gallinaceæ,\r\ncalled “tetras” in the United States. Soon they saw several pairs of\r\nthem, with brownish-yellow plumage and brown tails. Pencroff determined\r\nto capture one of these birds, for they were as big as hens, and their\r\nmeat as delicious as a pullet. But they would not let him come near\r\nthem. At last, after several unsuccessful attempts, he said,\r\n\r\n“Well, since we can’t kill them on the wing, we must take them with a\r\nline.”\r\n\r\n“Like a carp,” cried the wondering Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Like a carp,” answered the sailor, gravely.\r\n\r\nPencroff had found in the grass half-a-dozen tetras nests, with two or\r\nthree eggs in each.\r\n\r\nHe was very careful not to touch these nests, whose owners would\r\ncertainly return to them. Around these he purposed to draw his lines,\r\nnot as a snare, but with hook and bait. He took Herbert to some\r\ndistance from the nests, and there made ready his singular apparatus\r\nwith the care of a true disciple of Isaac Walton. Herbert watched the\r\nwork with a natural interest, but without much faith in its success.\r\nThe lines were made of small lianas tied together, from fifteen to\r\ntwenty feet long, and stout thorns with bent points, broken from a\r\nthicket of dwarf acacias, and fastened to the ends of the lianas,\r\nserved as hooks, and the great red worms which crawled at their feet\r\nmade excellent bait. This done, Pencroff, walking stealthily through\r\nthe grass, placed one end of his hook-and-line close to the nests of\r\nthe tetras. Then he stole back, took the other end in his hand, and hid\r\nhimself with Herbert behind a large tree. Herbert, it must be said, was\r\nnot sanguine of success.\r\n\r\nA good half hour passed, but as the sailor had foreseen, several pairs\r\nof tetras returned to their nests. They hopped about, pecking the\r\nground, and little suspecting the presence of the hunters, who had\r\ntaken care to station themselves to leeward of the gallinaceæ. Herbert\r\nheld his breath with excitement, while Pencroff, with dilated eyes,\r\nopen month, and lips parted as if to taste a morsel of tetras, scarcely\r\nbreathed. Meanwhile the gallinaceæ walked heedlessly among the hooks.\r\nPencroff then gave little jerks, which moved the bait up and down as if\r\nthe worms were still alive. How much more intense was his excitement\r\nthan the fisherman’s who cannot see the approach of his prey!\r\n\r\nThe jerks soon aroused the attention of the gallinaceæ, who began to\r\npeck at the bait. Three of the greediest swallowed hook and bait\r\ntogether. Suddenly, with a quick jerk, Pencroff pulled in his line, and\r\nthe flapping of wings showed that the birds were taken.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried he, springing upon the game, of which he was master in\r\na moment. Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time he had seen\r\nbirds taken with a line; but the modest sailor said it was not his\r\nfirst attempt, and, moreover, that the merit of the invention was not\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n“And at any rate,” said he, “in our present situation we must hope for\r\nmany such contrivances.”\r\n\r\nThe tetras were tied together by the feet, and Pencroff, happy that\r\nthey were not returning empty handed, and perceiving that the day was\r\nending, thought it best to return home.\r\n\r\nTheir route was indicated by the river, and following it downward, by 6\r\no’clock, tired out by their excursion, Herbert and Pencroff re-entered\r\nthe Chimneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEB HAS NOT YET RETURNED—THE REFLECTIONS OF THE REPORTER—THE\r\nSUPPER—PROSPECT OF A BAD NIGHT—THE STORM IS FRIGHTFUL—THEY GO OUT INTO\r\nTHE NIGHT—STRUGGLE WITH THE RAIN AND WIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett stood motionless upon the shore, his arms crossed,\r\ngazing on the sea, whose horizon was darkened towards the east by a\r\nhuge black cloud mounting rapidly into the zenith. The wind, already\r\nstrong, was freshening, the heavens had an angry look, and the first\r\nsymptoms of a heavy blow were manifesting themselves.\r\n\r\nHerbert went into the Chimneys, and Pencroff walked towards the\r\nreporter, who was too absorbed to notice his approach.\r\n\r\n“We will have a bad night, Mr. Spilett,” said the sailor. “Wind and\r\nrain enough for Mother Cary’s chickens.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter turning, and perceiving Pencroff, asked this question:—\r\n\r\n“How far off from the shore do you think was the basket when it was\r\nstruck by the sea that carried away our companion?”\r\n\r\nThe sailor had not expected this question. He reflected an instant\r\nbefore answering:—\r\n\r\n“Two cables’ lengths or more.”\r\n\r\n“How much is a cable’s length?” demanded Spilett.\r\n\r\n“About 120 fathoms, or 600 feet.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the reporter, “Cyrus Smith would have disappeared not more\r\nthan 1,200 feet from the shore?”\r\n\r\n“Not more than that.”\r\n\r\n“And his dog, too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What astonishes me,” said the reporter, “admitting that our companion\r\nand Top have perished, is the fact that neither the body of the dog nor\r\nof his master has been cast upon the shore.”\r\n\r\n“That is not astonishing with so heavy a sea,” replied the sailor.\r\n“Moreover, it is quite possible that there are currents which have\r\ncarried them farther up the coast.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is really your opinion that our companion has been drowned?”\r\nasked, once more, the reporter.\r\n\r\n“That is my opinion.”\r\n\r\n“And my opinion, Pencroff,” said Spilett, “with all respect for your\r\nexperience, is, that in this absolute disappearance of both Cyrus and\r\nTop, living or dead, there is something inexplicable and incredible.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could think as you do, sir,” responded Pencroff, “but,\r\nunhappily, I cannot.”\r\n\r\nAfter thus speaking the sailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire\r\nwas burning in the fireplace. Herbert had just thrown on a fresh armful\r\nof wood, and its flames lit up the dark recesses of the corridor.\r\n\r\nPencroff began at once to busy himself about dinner. It seemed\r\nexpedient to provide something substantial, as all stood in need of\r\nnourishment, so two tetras were quickly plucked, spitted upon a stick,\r\nand placed to roast before at blazing fire. The couroucous were\r\nreserved for the next day.\r\n\r\nAt 7 o’clock Neb was still absent, and Pencroff began to be alarmed\r\nabout him. He feared that he might have met with some accident in this\r\nunknown land, or that the poor fellow had been drawn by despair to some\r\nrash act. Herbert, on the contrary, argued that Neb’s absence was owing\r\nto some fresh discovery which had induced him to prolong his\r\nresearches. And anything new must be to Cyrus Smith’s advantage. Why\r\nhad not Neb come back, if some hope was not detaining him? Perhaps he\r\nhad found some sign or footprint which had put him upon the track.\r\nPerhaps, at this moment he was following the trail. Perhaps, already,\r\nhe was beside his master.\r\n\r\nThus the lad spoke and reasoned, unchecked by his companions. The\r\nreporter nodded approval, but Pencroff thought it more probable that\r\nNeb, in his search, had pushed on so far that he had not been able to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Herbert, excited by vague presentiments, manifested a desire\r\nto go to meet Neb. But Pencroff showed him that it would be useless in\r\nthe darkness and storm to attempt to find traces of the negro, and,\r\nthat the better course was, to wait. If, by morning, Neb had not\r\nreturned, Pencroff would not hesitate joining the lad in a search for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett concurred with the sailor in his opinion that they had\r\nbetter remain together, and Herbert, though tearfully, gave up the\r\nproject. The reporter could not help embracing the generous lad.\r\n\r\nThe storm began. A furious gust of wind passed over the coast from the\r\nsoutheast. They heard the sea, which was out, roaring upon the reef.\r\nThe whirlwind drove the rain in clouds along the shore. The sand,\r\nstirred up by the wind, mingled with the rain, and the air was filled\r\nwith mineral as well as aqueous dust. Between the mouth of the river\r\nand the cliff’s face, the wind whirled about as in a maelstrom, and,\r\nfinding no other outlet than the narrow valley through which ran the\r\nstream, it rushed through this with irresistible violence.\r\n\r\nOften, too, the smoke from the chimney, driven back down its narrow\r\nvent, filled the corridors, and rendered them uninhabitable. Therefore,\r\nwhen the tetras were cooked Pencroff let the fire smoulder, only\r\npreserving some clear embers among the ashes.\r\n\r\nAt 8 o’clock Neb had not returned; but they could not help admitting\r\nthat now the tempest alone was sufficient to account for his\r\nnon-appearance, and that, probably, he had sought refuge in some\r\ncavern, waiting the end of the storm, or, at least, daybreak. As to\r\ngoing to meet him under present circumstances, that was simply\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe birds were all they had for supper, but the party found them\r\nexcellent eating. Pencroff and Herbert, their appetite sharpened by\r\ntheir long walk, devoured them. Then each one retired to his corner,\r\nand Herbert, lying beside the sailor, extended before the fireplace,\r\nwas soon asleep.\r\n\r\nOutside, as the night advanced, the storm developed formidable\r\nproportions. It was a hurricane equal to that which had carried the\r\nprisoners from Richmond. Such tempests, pregnant with catastrophes,\r\nspreading terror over a vast area, their fury withstood by no obstacle,\r\nare frequent during the equinox. We can understand how a coast facing\r\nthe east, and exposed to the full fury of the storm, was attacked with\r\na violence perfectly indescribable.\r\n\r\nHappily the heap of rocks forming the Chimneys was composed of solid,\r\nenormous blocks of granite, though some of them, imperfectly balanced,\r\nseemed to tremble upon their foundations. Pencroff, placing his hand\r\nagainst the walls, could feel their rapid vibrations; but he said to\r\nhimself, with reason, that there was no real danger, and that the\r\nimprovised retreat would not tumble about their ears. Nevertheless, he\r\nheard the sound of rocks, torn from the top of the plateau by the\r\ngusts, crashing upon the shore. And some, falling perpendicularly,\r\nstruck the Chimneys and flew off into fragments. Twice the sailor rose,\r\nand went to the opening of the corridor, to look abroad. But there was\r\nno danger from these inconsiderable showers of stones, and he returned\r\nto his place before the fire, where the embers glowed among the ashes.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fury and fracas of the tempest Herbert slept\r\nprofoundly, and, at length, sleep took possession of Pencroff, whose\r\nsailor life had accustomed him to such demonstrations. Gideon Spilett,\r\nwho was kept awake by anxiety, reproached himself for not having\r\naccompanied Neb. We have seen that he had not given up all hope, and\r\nthe presentiments which had disturbed Herbert had affected him also.\r\nHis thoughts were fixed upon Neb; why had not the negro returned? He\r\ntossed about on his sandy couch, unheeding the warfare of the elements.\r\nThen, overcome by fatigue, he would close his eyes for an instant, only\r\nto be awakened by some sudden thought.\r\n\r\nMeantime the night advanced; and it was about 2 o’clock when Pencroff\r\nwas suddenly aroused from a deep sleep by finding himself vigorously\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” he cried, rousing and collecting himself with the\r\nquickness peculiar to sailors.\r\n\r\nThe reporter was bending over him and saying:—\r\n\r\n“Listen, Pencroff, listen!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor listened, but could hear no sounds other than those caused\r\nby the gusts.\r\n\r\n“It is the wind,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Spilett, listening again, “I think I heard—”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“The barking of a dog!”\r\n\r\n“A dog!” cried Pencroff, springing to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Yes—the barking—”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” answered the sailor. “How, in the roarings of the\r\ntempest—”\r\n\r\n“Wait—listen,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\nPencroff listened most attentively, and at length, during a lull, he\r\nthought he caught the sound of distant barking.\r\n\r\n“Is it?” asked the reporter, squeezing the sailor’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes!” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“It is Top! It is Top!” cried Herbert, who had just wakened, and the\r\nthree rushed to the entrance of the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThey had great difficulty in getting out, as the wind drove against\r\nthem with fury, but at last they succeeded, and then they were obliged\r\nto steady themselves against the rocks. They were unable to speak, but\r\nthey looked about them. The darkness was absolute. Sea, sky, and earth,\r\nwere one intense blackness. It seemed as if there was not one particle\r\nof light diffused in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the reporter and his two companions stood in this\r\nplace, beset by the gusts, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand.\r\nThen again, in the hush of the storm, they heard, far away, the barking\r\nof a dog. This must be Top. But was he alone or accompanied? Probably\r\nalone, for if Neb had been with him, the negro would have hastened, at\r\nonce, to the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe sailor pressed the reporter’s hand in a manner signifying that he\r\nwas to remain without, and then returning to the corridor, emerged a\r\nmoment later with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the darkness, at\r\nthe same time whistling shrilly. At this signal, which seemed to have\r\nbeen looked for, the answering barks came nearer, and soon a dog\r\nbounded into the corridor, followed by the three companions. An armful\r\nof wood was thrown upon the coals, brightly lighting up the passage.\r\n\r\n“It is Top!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, uniting in the cross of\r\nthe two breeds those qualities—swiftness of foot and keenness of\r\nscent—indispensable in coursing dogs. But he was alone! Neither his\r\nmaster nor Neb accompanied him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed inexplicable how, through the darkness and storm, the dog’s\r\ninstinct had directed him to the Chimneys, a place he was unacquainted\r\nwith. But still more unaccountable was the fact that he was neither\r\nfatigued nor exhausted nor soiled with mud or sand. Herbert had drawn\r\nhim towards him, patting his head; and the dog rubbed his neck against\r\nthe lad’s hands.\r\n\r\n“If the dog is found, the master will be found also,” said the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\n“God grant it!” responded Herbert. “Come, let us set out. Top will\r\nguide us!”\r\n\r\nPencroff made no objection. He saw that the dog’s cunning had disproved\r\nhis conjectures.\r\n\r\n“Let us set out at once,” he said; and covering the fire so that it\r\ncould be relighted on their return, and preceded by the dog, who seemed\r\nto invite their departure, the sailor, having gathered up the remnants\r\nof the supper, followed by the reporter and Herbert, rushed into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe tempest, then in all its violence, was, perhaps, at its maximum\r\nintensity. The new moon had not sufficient light to pierce the clouds.\r\nIt was difficult to follow a straight course. The better way,\r\ntherefore, was to trust to the instinct of Top; which was done. The\r\nreporter and the lad walked behind the dog, and the sailor followed\r\nafter. To speak was impossible. The rain, dispersed by the wind, was\r\nnot heavy, but the strength of the storm was terrible.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as it came from the southeast, the wind was at the back of\r\nthe party, and the sand, hurled from behind, did not prevent their\r\nmarch. Indeed, they were often blown along so rapidly as nearly to be\r\noverthrown. But they were sustained by a great hope. This time, at\r\nleast, they were not wandering at random. They felt, no doubt, that Neb\r\nhad found his master and had sent the faithful dog to them. But was the\r\nengineer living, or had Neb summoned his companions only to render the\r\nlast services to the dead?\r\n\r\nAfter having passed the smooth face of rock, which they carefully\r\navoided, the party stopped to take breath. The angle of the cliff\r\nsheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe freely after this\r\ntramp, or rather race, of a quarter of an hour. They were now able to\r\nhear themselves speak, and the lad having pronounced the name of Smith,\r\nthe dog seemed to say by his glad barking that his master was safe.\r\n\r\n“Saved! He is saved! Isn’t he, Top?” repeated the boy. And the dog\r\nbarked his answer.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past 2 when the march was resumed. The sea began to rise,\r\nand this, which was a spring tide backed up by the wind, threatened to\r\nbe very high. The tremendous breakers thundered against the reef,\r\nassailing it so violently as probably to pass completely over the\r\nislet, which was invisible. The coast was no longer sheltered by this\r\nlong breakwater, but was exposed to the full fury of the open sea.\r\n\r\nAfter the party were clear of the precipice the storm attacked them\r\nagain with fury. Crouching, with backs still to the wind, they followed\r\nTop, who never hesitated in his course. Mounting towards the north,\r\nthey had upon their right the endless line of breakers deafening them\r\nwith its thunders, and upon their left a region buried in darkness. One\r\nthing was certain, that they were upon an open plain, as the wind\r\nrushed over them without rebounding as it had done from the granite\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nBy 4 o’clock they estimated the distance travelled as eight miles. The\r\nclouds had risen a little, and the wind was drier and colder.\r\nInsufficiently clad, the three companions suffered cruelly, but no\r\nmurmur passed their lips. They were determined to follow Top wherever\r\nhe wished to lead them.\r\n\r\nTowards 5 o’clock the day began to break. At first, overhead, where\r\nsome grey shadowings bordered the clouds, and presently, under a dark\r\nband a bright streak of light sharply defined the sea horizon. The\r\ncrests of the billows shone with a yellow light and the foam revealed\r\nits whiteness. At the same time, on the left, the hilly parts of the\r\nshore were confusedly defined in grey outlines upon the blackness of\r\nthe night. At 6 o’clock it was daylight. The clouds sped rapidly\r\noverhead. The sailor and his companions were some six miles from the\r\nChimneys, following a very flat shore, bordered in the offing by a reef\r\nof rocks whose surface only was visible above the high tide. On the\r\nleft the country sloped up into downs bristling with thistles, giving a\r\nforbidding aspect to the vast sandy region. The shore was low, and\r\noffered no other resistance to the ocean than an irregular chain of\r\nhillocks. Here and there was a tree, leaning its trunks and branches\r\ntowards the west. Far behind, to the southwest, extended the borders of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Top gave unequivocal signs of excitement. He ran ahead,\r\nreturned, and seemed to try to hurry them on. The dog had left the\r\ncoast, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without any hesitation had\r\ngone among the downs. They followed him through a region absolutely\r\ndevoid of life.\r\n\r\nThe border of the downs, itself large, was composed of hills and\r\nhillocks, unevenly scattered here and there. It was like a little\r\nSwitzerland of sand, and nothing but a dog’s astonishing instinct could\r\nfind the way.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after leaving the shore the reporter and his companions\r\nreached a sort of hollow, formed in the back of a high down, before\r\nwhich Top stopped with a loud bark. The three entered the cave.\r\n\r\nNeb was there, kneeling beside a body extended upon a bed of grass—\r\n\r\nIt was the body of Cyrus Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS CYPRUS SMITH ALIVE?—NEB’S STORY—FOOTPRINTS —AN INSOLUBLE\r\nQUESTION—THE FIRST WORDS OF SMITH—COMPARING THE FOOTPRINTS—RETURN TO\r\nTHE CHIMNEYS—PENCROFF DEJECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeb did not move. The sailor uttered one word.\r\n\r\n“Living!” he cried.\r\n\r\nThe negro did not answer. Spilett and Pencroff turned pale. Herbert,\r\nclasping his hands, stood motionless. But it was evident that the poor\r\nnegro, overcome by grief, had neither seen his companions nor heard the\r\nvoice of the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and, having opened\r\nthe clothing, pressed his ear to the chest of the engineer. A minute,\r\nwhich seemed an age, passed, daring which he tried to detect some\r\nmovement of the heart.\r\n\r\nNeb raised up a little, and looked on as if in a trance. Overcome by\r\nexhaustion, prostrated by grief, the poor fellow was hardly\r\nrecognizable. He believed his master dead.\r\n\r\nGideon Spilett, after a long and attentive examination, rose up.\r\n\r\n“He lives!” he said.\r\n\r\nPencroff, in his turn, knelt down beside Cyrus Smith; he also detected\r\nsome heartbeats, and a slight breath issuing from the lips of the\r\nengineer. Herbert, at a word from the reporter, hurried in search of\r\nwater. A hundred paces off he found a clear brook swollen by the late\r\nrains and filtered by the sand. But there was nothing, not even a\r\nshell, in which to carry the water; so the lad had to content himself\r\nwith soaking his handkerchief in the stream, and hastened back with it\r\nto the cave.\r\n\r\nHappily the handkerchief held sufficient for Spilett’s purpose, which\r\nwas simply to moisten the lips of the engineer. The drops of fresh\r\nwater produced an instantaneous effect. A sigh escaped from the breast\r\nof Smith, and it seemed as if he attempted to speak.\r\n\r\n“We shall save him,” said the reporter. Neb took heart at these words.\r\nHe removed the clothing from his master to see if his body was anywhere\r\nwounded. But neither on his head nor body nor limbs was there a bruise\r\nor even a scratch, an astonishing circumstance, since he must have been\r\ntossed about among the rocks; even his hands were uninjured, and it was\r\ndifficult to explain how the engineer should exhibit no mark of the\r\nefforts which he must have made in getting over the reef.\r\n\r\nBut the explanation of this circumstance would come later, when Cyrus\r\nSmith could speak. At present, it was necessary to restore his\r\nconsciousness, and it was probable that this result could be\r\naccomplished by friction. For this purpose they mode use of the\r\nsailor’s pea-jacket. The engineer, warmed by this rude rubbing, moved\r\nhis arms slightly, and his breathing began to be more regular. He was\r\ndying from exhaustion, and, doubtless, had not the reporter and his\r\ncompanions arrived, it would have been all over with Cyrus Smith.\r\n\r\n“You thought he was dead?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I thought so,” answered Neb. “And if Top had not found you and\r\nbrought you back, I would have buried my master and died beside him.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer had had a narrow escape!\r\n\r\nThen Neb told them what had happened. The day before, after having left\r\nthe Chimneys at day-break, he had followed along the coast in a\r\ndirection due north, until he reached that part of the beach which he\r\nhad already visited. There, though, as he said, without hope of\r\nsuccess, he searched the shore, the rocks, the sand for any marks that\r\ncould guide him, examining most carefully that part which was above\r\nhigh-water mark, as below that point the ebb and flow of the tide would\r\nhave effaced all traces. He did not hope to find his master living. It\r\nwas the discovery of the body which he sought, that he might bury it\r\nwith his own hands. He searched a long time, without success. It seemed\r\nas if nothing human had ever been upon that desolate shore. Of the\r\nmillions of shell-fish lying out of reach of the tide, not a shell was\r\nbroken. There was no sign of a landing having ever been made there. The\r\nnegro then decided to continue some miles further up the coast. It was\r\npossible that the currents had carried the body to some distant point.\r\nFor Neb knew that a corpse, floating a little distance from a low\r\nshore, was almost certain, sooner or later, to be thrown upon the\r\nstrand, and he was desirous to look upon his master one last time.\r\n\r\n“I followed the shore two miles further, looking at it at low and high\r\nwater, hardly hoping to find anything, when yesterday evening, about 5\r\no’clock, I discovered footprints upon the sand.”\r\n\r\n“Footprints,” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied Neb.\r\n\r\n“And did they begin at the water?” demanded the reporter.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the negro, “above high-water mark; below that the tide\r\nhad washed out the others.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, Neb,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“The sight of these footprints made me wild with joy. They were very\r\nplain, and went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of an\r\nhour, running so as not to tread on them. Five minutes later, as it was\r\ngrowing dark, I heard a dog bark. It was Top. And he brought me here,\r\nto my master.”\r\n\r\nNeb finished his recital by telling of his grief at the discovery of\r\nthe inanimate body. He had tried to discover some signs of life still\r\nremaining in it. But all his efforts were in vain. There was nothing,\r\ntherefore, to do but to perform the last offices to him whom he had\r\nloved so well. Then he thought of his companions. They, too, would wish\r\nto look once more upon their comrade. Top was there. Could he not rely\r\nupon the sagacity of that faithful animal? So having pronounced several\r\ntimes the name of the reporter, who, of all the engineer’s companions,\r\nwas best known by Top, and having at the same time motioned towards the\r\nsouth, the dog bounded off in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, guided by an almost supernatural instinct, the dog\r\nhad arrived at the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nNeb’s companions listened to his story with the greatest attention. How\r\nthe engineer had been able to reach this cave in the midst of the\r\ndowns, more than a mile from the beach, was as inexplicable as was his\r\nescape from the waves and rocks without a scratch.\r\n\r\n“So you, Neb,” said the reporter, “did not bring your master to this\r\nplace?”\r\n\r\n“No, it was not I,” answered Neb.\r\n\r\n“He certainly could not have come alone,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“But he must have done it, though it does not seem credible,” said the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\nThey must wait for the solution of the mystery until the engineer could\r\nspeak. Fortunately the rubbing had re-established the circulation of\r\nthe blood, and life was returning. Smith moved his arm again, then his\r\nhead, and a second time some incoherent words escaped his lips.\r\n\r\nNeb, leaning over him, spoke, but the engineer seemed not to hear, and\r\nhis eyes remained closed. Life was revealing itself by movement, but\r\nconsciousness had not yet returned. Pencroff had, unfortunately,\r\nforgotten to bring the burnt linen, which could have been ignited with\r\na couple of flints, and without it they had no means of making a fire.\r\nThe pockets of the engineer were empty of everything but his watch. It\r\nwas therefore the unanimous opinion that Cyrus Smith must be carried to\r\nthe Chimneys as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMeantime the attention lavished on the engineer restored him to\r\nconsciousness sooner than could have been hoped. The moistening of his\r\nlips had revived him, and Pencroff conceived the idea of mixing some of\r\nthe juice of the tetras with water. Herbert ran to the shore and\r\nbrought back two large shells; and the sailor made a mixture which they\r\nintroduced between the lips of the engineer, who swallowed it with\r\navidity. His eyes opened. Neb and the reporter were leaning over him.\r\n\r\n“My master! my master!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\nThe engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and his companions, and his\r\nhand gently pressed theirs.\r\n\r\nAgain he spoke some words—doubtless the same which he had before\r\nuttered, and which indicated that some thoughts were troubling him.\r\nThis time the words were understood.\r\n\r\n“Island or continent?” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“What the devil do we care,” cried Pencroff, unable to restrain the\r\nexclamation, “now that you are alive, sir. Island or continent? “We\r\nwill find that out later.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer made a motion in the affirmative, and then seemed to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nTaking care not to disturb him, the reporter set to work to provide the\r\nmost comfortable means of moving him.\r\n\r\nNeb, Herbert, and Pencroff left the cave and went towards a high down\r\non which were some gnarled trees. On the way the sailor kept\r\nrepeating:—\r\n\r\n“Island or continent! To think of that, at his last gasp! What a man!”\r\n\r\nHaving reached the top of the down, Pencroff and his companions tore\r\noff the main branches from a tree, a sort of sea pine, sickly and\r\nstunted. And with these branches they constructed a litter, which they\r\ncovered with leaves and grass.\r\n\r\nThis work occupied some little time, and it was 10 o’clock when the\r\nthree returned to Smith and Spilett.\r\n\r\nThe engineer had just wakened from the sleep, or rather stupor, in\r\nwhich they had found him. The color had come back to his lips, which\r\nhad been as pale as death. He raised himself slightly, and looked\r\nabout, as if questioning where he was.\r\n\r\n“Can you listen to me without being tired, Cyrus?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” responded the engineer.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said the sailor, “that Mr. Smith can listen better after\r\nhaving taken some more of this tetra jelly,—it is really tetra, sir,”\r\nhe continued, as he gave him some of the mixture, to which he had this\r\ntime added some of the meat of the bird.\r\n\r\nCyrus Smith swallowed these bits of tetra, and the remainder was eaten\r\nby his companions, who were suffering from hunger, and who found the\r\nrepast light enough.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the sailor, “there are victuals waiting for us at the\r\nChimneys, for you must know, Mr. Smith, that to the south of here we\r\nhave a house with rooms and beds and fire-place, and in the pantry\r\ndozens of birds which our Herbert calls couroucous. Your litter is\r\nready, and whenever you feel strong enough we will carry you to our\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my friend,” replied the engineer, “in an hour or two we will\r\ngo. And now, Spilett, continue.”\r\n\r\nThe reporter related everything that had happened. Recounting the\r\nevents unknown to Smith; the last plunge of the balloon, the landing\r\nupon this unknown shore, its deserted appearance, the discovery of the\r\nChimneys, the search for the engineer, the devotion of Neb, and what\r\nthey owed to Top’s intelligence, etc.\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Smith, in a feeble voice, “you did not pick me up on the\r\nbeach?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\n“And it was not you who brought me to this hollow?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“How far is this place from the reef?”\r\n\r\n“At least half a mile,” replied Pencroff, “and if you are astonished,\r\nwe are equally surprised to find you here.”\r\n\r\n“It is indeed singular,” said the engineer, who was gradually reviving\r\nand taking interest in these details.\r\n\r\n“But,” asked the sailor, “cannot you remember anything that happened\r\nafter you were washed away by that heavy sea?”\r\n\r\nCyrus Smith tried to think, but he remembered little. The wave had\r\nswept him from the net of the balloon, and at first he had sunk several\r\nfathoms. Coming up to the surface, he was conscious, in the half-light,\r\nof something struggling beside him. It was Top, who had sprung to his\r\nrescue. Looking up, he could see nothing of the balloon, which,\r\nlightened by his and the dog’s weight, had sped away like an arrow. He\r\nfound himself in the midst of the tumultuous sea, more than half a mile\r\nfrom shore. He swum vigorously against the waves, and Top sustained him\r\nby his garments; but a strong current seized him, carrying him to the\r\nnorth, and, after struggling for half an hour, he sank, dragging the\r\ndog with him into the abyss. From that moment to the instant of his\r\nfinding himself in the arms of his friends, he remembered nothing.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said Pencroff, “you must have been cast upon the shore,\r\nand had strength enough to walk to this place, since Neb found your\r\ntracks.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that must be so,” answered the engineer, reflectively. “And you\r\nhave not seen any traces of inhabitants upon the shore?”\r\n\r\n“Not a sign,” answered the reporter. “Moreover, if by chance some one\r\nhad rescued you from the waves, why should he then have abandoned you?”\r\n\r\n“You are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb,” inquired the engineer,\r\nturning towards his servant, “it was not you—you could not have been in\r\na trance—during which—. No, that’s absurd. Do any of the footprints\r\nstill remain?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, master,” replied Neb; “there are some at the entrance, back of\r\nthis mound, in a place sheltered from the wind and rain, but the others\r\nhave been obliterated by the storm.”\r\n\r\n“Pencroff,” said Cyrus, “will you take my shoes and see if they fit\r\nthose footprints exactly?”\r\n\r\nThe sailor did as he had been asked. He and Herbert, guided by Neb,\r\nwent to where the marks were, and in their absence Smith said to the\r\nreporter:—\r\n\r\n“That is a thing passing belief.”\r\n\r\n“Inexplicable, indeed,” answered the other.\r\n\r\n“But do not dwell upon it at present, my dear Spilett, we will talk of\r\nit hereafter.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the others returned. All doubt was set at rest. The\r\nshoes of the engineer fitted the tracks exactly. Therefore it must have\r\nbeen Smith himself who had walked over the sand.\r\n\r\n“So,” he said, “I was the one in a trance, and not Neb! I must have\r\nwalked like a somnambulist, without consciousness, and Top’s instinct\r\nbrought me here after he rescued me from the waves. Here, Top. Come\r\nhere, dog.”\r\n\r\nThe splendid animal sprang, barking, to his master, and caresses were\r\nlavished upon him. It was agreed that there was no other way to account\r\nfor the rescue than by giving Top the credit of it.\r\n\r\nTowards noon, Pencroff having asked Smith if he felt strong enough to\r\nbe carried, the latter, for answer, by an effort which showed his\r\nstrength of will, rose to his feet. But if he had not leaned upon the\r\nsailor he would have fallen.\r\n\r\n“Capital,” said Pencroff. “Summon the engineer’s carriage!”\r\n\r\nThe litter was brought. The cross-branches had been covered with moss\r\nand grass; and when Smith was laid upon it they walked towards the\r\ncoast, Neb and the sailor carrying him.\r\n\r\nEight miles had to be travelled, and as they could move but slowly, and\r\nwould probably have to make frequent rests, it would take six hours or\r\nmore to reach the Chimneys. The wind was still strong, but,\r\nfortunately, it had ceased raining. From his couch, the engineer,\r\nleaning upon his arm, observed the coast, especially the part opposite\r\nthe sea. He examined it without comment, but undoubtedly the aspect of\r\nthe country, its contour, its forests and diverse products were noted\r\nin his mind. But after two hours, fatigue overcame him, and he slept\r\nupon the litter.\r\n\r\nAt half-past 5 the little party reached the precipice, and soon after,\r\nwere before the Chimneys. Stopping here, the litter was placed upon the\r\nsand without disturbing the slumber of the engineer.\r\n\r\nPencroff saw, to his surprise, that the terrible storm of the day\r\nbefore had altered the aspect of the place. Rocks had been displaced.\r\nGreat fragments were strewn over the sand, and a thick carpet of\r\nseveral kinds of seaweed covered all the shore. It was plain that the\r\nsea sweeping over the isle had reached to the base of the enormous\r\ngranite curtain.\r\n\r\nBefore the entrance to the Chimneys the ground had been violently torn\r\nup by the action of the waves. Pencroff, seized with a sudden fear,\r\nrushed into the corridor. Returning, a moment after, he stood\r\nmotionless looking at his comrades.\r\n\r\nThe fire had been extinguished; the drowned cinders were nothing but\r\nmud. The charred linen, which was to serve them for tinder, had gone.\r\nThe sea had penetrated every recess of the corridor, and everything was\r\noverthrown, everything was destroyed within the Chimneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYRUS IS HERE-PENCROFF’S ATTEMPTS—RUBBING WOOD—ISLAND OR CONTINENT —THE\r\nPLANS OF THE ENGINEER—WHEREABOUTS IN THE PACIFIC—IN THE DEPTHS OF THE\r\nFOREST—THE PISTACHIO PINE—A PIG CHASE—A SMOKE OF GOOD OMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few words the others were informed of what had happened. This\r\naccident, which portended serious results—at least Pencroff foresaw\r\nsuch—affected each one differently. Neb, overjoyed in having recovered\r\nhis master, did not listen or did not wish to think of what Pencroff\r\nsaid. Herbert shared in a measure the apprehensions of the sailor. As\r\nto the reporter, he simply answered:—\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Pencroff, I don’t think it matters much!”\r\n\r\n“But I tell you again; we have no fire!”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!”\r\n\r\n“Nor any means of lighting one!”\r\n\r\n“Absurd!”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Spilett—”\r\n\r\n“Is not Cyrus here?” asked the reporter; “Isn’t he alive? He will know\r\nwell enough how to make fire!”\r\n\r\n“And with what?”\r\n\r\n“With nothing!”\r\n\r\nWhat could Pencroff answer? He had nothing to say, as, in his heart, he\r\nshared his companion’s confidence in Cyrus Smith’s ability. To them the\r\nengineer was a microcosm, a compound of all science and all knowledge.\r\nThey were better off on a desert island with Cyrus than without him in\r\nthe busiest city of the Union. With him they could want for nothing;\r\nwith him they would have no fear. If they had been told that a volcanic\r\neruption would overwhelm the land, sinking it into the depths of the\r\nPacific, the imperturbable answer of these brave men would have been,\r\n“Have we not Cyrus!”\r\n\r\nMeantime, the engineer had sunk into a lethargy, the result of the\r\njourney, and his help could not be asked for just then. The supper,\r\ntherefore, would be very meagre. All the tetras had been eaten, there\r\nwas no way to cook other birds, and, finally, the couroucous which had\r\nbeen reserved had disappeared. Something, therefore, must be done.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Cyrus Smith was carried into the main corridor. There\r\nthey were able to make for him a couch of seaweeds, and, doubtless, the\r\ndeep sleep in which he was plunged, would strengthen him more than an\r\nabundant nourishment.\r\n\r\nWith night the temperature, which the northwest wind had raised, again\r\nbecame very cold, and, as the sea had washed away the partitions which\r\nPencroff had constructed, draughts of air made the place scarcely\r\nhabitable. The engineer would therefore have been in a bad plight if\r\nhis companions had not covered him with clothing which they took from\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe supper this evening consisted of the inevitable lithodomes, an\r\nample supply of which Herbert and Neb had gathered from the beach. To\r\nthese the lad had added a quantity of edible seaweed which clung to the\r\nhigh rocks and were only washed by the highest tides. These seaweeds,\r\nbelonging to the family of Fucaceæ, were a species of Sargassum, which,\r\nwhen dry, furnish a gelatinous substance full of nutritive matter, much\r\nused by the natives of the Asiatic coast. After having eaten a quantity\r\nof lithodomes the reporter and his companions sucked some of the\r\nseaweed, which they agreed was excellent.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said the sailor, “it is time for Mr. Smith to help us.”\r\n\r\nMeantime the cold became intense, and, unfortunately, they had no means\r\nof protecting themselves. The sailor, much worried, tried every\r\npossible means of procuring a fire. He had found some dry moss, and by\r\nstriking two stones together he obtained sparks; but the moss was not\r\nsufficiently inflammable to catch fire, nor had the sparks the strength\r\nof those struck by a steel. The operation amounted to nothing. Then\r\nPencroff, although he had no confidence in the result, tried rubbing\r\ntwo pieces of dry wood together, after the manner of the savages. It is\r\ntrue that the motion of the man, if it could have been turned into\r\nheat, according to the new theory, would have heated the boiler of a\r\nsteamer. But it resulted in nothing except putting him in a glow, and\r\nmaking the wood hot. After half an hour’s work Pencroff was in a\r\nperspiration, and he threw away the wood in disgust.\r\n\r\n“When you can make me believe that savages make fire after that\r\nfashion,” said he, “it will he hot in winter! I might as well try to\r\nlight my arms by rubbing them together.”\r\n\r\nBut the sailor was wrong to deny the feasibility of this method. The\r\nsavages frequently do light wood in this way. But it requires\r\nparticular kinds of wood, and, moreover, the “knack,” and Pencroff had\r\nnot this “knack.”\r\n\r\nPencroff’s ill humor did not last long. The bits of wood which he had\r\nthrown away had been picked up by Herbert, who exerted himself to rub\r\nthem well. The strong sailor could not help laughing at the boy’s weak\r\nefforts to accomplish what he had failed in.\r\n\r\n“Rub away, my boy; rub hard!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“I am rubbing them,” answered Herbert, laughing, “but only to take my\r\nturn at getting warm, instead of sitting here shivering; and pretty\r\nsoon I will be as hot as you are, Pencroff!”\r\n\r\nThis was the case, and though it was necessary for this night to give\r\nup trying to make a fire, Spilett, stretching himself upon the sand in\r\none of the passages, repeated for the twentieth time that Smith could\r\nnot be baffled by such a trifle. The others followed his example, and\r\nTop slept at the feet of his master.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about 8\r\no’clock, he saw his companions beside him watching, and, as on the day\r\nbefore, his first words were,\r\n\r\n“Island or continent?”\r\n\r\nIt was his one thought.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Smith,” answered Pencroff, “we don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t found out yet?”\r\n\r\n“But we will,” affirmed Pencroff, “when you are able to guide us in\r\nthis country.”\r\n\r\n“I believe that I am able to do that now,” answered the engineer, who,\r\nwithout much effort, rose up and stood erect.\r\n\r\n“That is good,” exclaimed the sailor.\r\n\r\n“I am dying of hunger,” responded Smith. “Give me some food, my friend,\r\nand I will feel better. You’ve fire, haven’t you?”\r\n\r\nThis question met with no immediate answer. But after some moments the\r\nsailor said:—\r\n\r\n“No, sir, we have no fire; at least, not now.”\r\n\r\nAnd be related what had happened the day before. He amused the engineer\r\nby recounting the history of their solitary match, and their fruitless\r\nefforts to procure fire like the savages.\r\n\r\n“We will think about it,” answered the engineer, “and if we cannot find\r\nsomething like tinder—”\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Well, we will make matches!”\r\n\r\n“Friction matches?”\r\n\r\n“Friction matches!”\r\n\r\n“It’s no more difficult than that,” cried the reporter, slapping the\r\nsailor on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe latter did not see that it would be easy, but he said nothing, and\r\nall went out of doors. The day was beautiful. A bright sun was rising\r\nabove the sea horizon, its rays sparkling and glistening on the granite\r\nwall. After having cast a quick look about him, the engineer seated\r\nhimself upon a rock. Herbert offered him some handfuls of mussels and\r\nseaweed, saying:—\r\n\r\n“It is all that we have, Mr. Smith.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my boy,” answered he, “it is enough—for this morning, at\r\nleast.”\r\n\r\nAnd he ate with appetite this scanty meal, washing it down with water\r\nbrought from the river in a large shell.\r\n\r\nHis companions looked on without speaking. Then, after having satisfied\r\nhimself, he crossed his arms and said:—\r\n\r\n“Then, my friends, you do not yet know whether we have been thrown upon\r\nan island or a continent?”\r\n\r\n“No sir,” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“We will find out to-morrow,” said the engineer. “Until then there is\r\nnothing to do.”\r\n\r\n“There is one thing,” suggested Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Some fire,” replied the sailor, who thought of nothing else.\r\n\r\n“We will have it, Pencroff,” said Smith. “But when you were carrying me\r\nhere yesterday, did not I see a mountain rising in the west?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” saidSpilett, “quite a high one.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” exclaimed the engineer. “Tomorrow we will climb to its\r\nsummit and determine whether this is an island or a continent; until\r\nthen I repeat there is nothing to do.”\r\n\r\n“But there is; we want fire!” cried the obstinate sailor again.\r\n\r\n“Have a little patience, Pencroff, and we will have the fire,” said\r\nSpilett.\r\n\r\nThe other looked at the reporter as much as to say, “If there was only\r\nyou to make it we would never taste roast meat.” But he kept silent.\r\n\r\nSmith had not spoken. He seemed little concerned about this question of\r\nfire. For some moments he remained absorbed in his own thoughts. Then\r\nhe spoke as follows:—\r\n\r\n“My friends, our situation is, doubtless, deplorable, nevertheless it\r\nis very simple. Either we are upon a continent, and, in that case, at\r\nthe expense of greater or less fatigue, we will reach some inhabited\r\nplace, or else we are on an island. In the latter case, it is one of\r\ntwo things; if the island is inhabited, we will get out of our\r\ndifficulty by the help of the inhabitants; if it is deserted, we will\r\nget out of it by ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be plainer than that,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Spilett, “whether it is a continent or an island,\r\nwhereabouts do you think this storm has thrown us, Cyrus?”\r\n\r\n“In truth, I cannot say,” replied the engineer, “but the probability is\r\nthat we are somewhere in the Pacific. When we left Richmond the wind\r\nwas northeast, and its very violence proves that its direction did not\r\nvary much. Supposing it unchanged, we crossed North and South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, the Gulf of Mexico, and the narrow part of Mexico, and a\r\nportion of the Pacific Ocean. I do not estimate the distance traversed\r\nby the balloon at less than 6,000 or 7,000 miles, and even if the wind\r\nhad varied a half a quarter it would have carried us either to the\r\nMarquesas Islands or to the Low Archipelago; or, if it was stronger\r\nthan I suppose, as far as New Zealand. If this last hypothesis is\r\ncorrect, our return home will be easy. English or Maoris, we shall\r\nalways find somebody with whom to speak. If, on the other hand, this\r\ncoast belongs to some barren island in the Micronesian Archipelago,\r\nperhaps we can reconnoitre it from the summit of this mountain, and\r\nthen we will consider how to establish ourselves here as if we were\r\nnever going to leave it.”\r\n\r\n“Never?” cried the reporter. “Do you say never, my dear Cyrus?”\r\n\r\n“It is better to put things in their worst light at first,” answered\r\nthe engineer; “and to reserve those which are better, as a surprise.”\r\n\r\n“Well said,” replied Pencroff. “And we hope that this island, if it is\r\nan island, will not be situated just outside of the route of ships; for\r\nthat would, indeed, be unlucky.”\r\n\r\n“We will know how to act after having first ascended the mountain,”\r\nanswered Smith.\r\n\r\n“But will you be able, Mr. Smith, to make the climb tomorrow?” asked\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” answered the engineer, “if Pencroff and you, my boy, show\r\nyourselves to be good and ready hunters.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” said the sailor, “since you are speaking of game, if when\r\nI come back I am as sure of getting it roasted as I am of bringing it—”\r\n\r\n“Bring it, nevertheless,” interrupted Smith.\r\n\r\nIt was now agreed that the engineer and the reporter should spend the\r\nday at the Chimneys, in order to examine the shore and the plateau,\r\nwhile Neb, Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the forest, renew\r\nthe supply of wood, and lay hands on every bird and beast that should\r\ncross their path. So, at 6 o’clock, the party left, Herbert confident.\r\nNeb happy, and Pencroff muttering to himself:—\r\n\r\n“If, when I get back I find a fire in the house, it will have been the\r\nlightning that lit it!”\r\n\r\nThe three climbed the bank, and having reached the turn in the river,\r\nthe sailor stopped and said to his companions:—\r\n\r\n“Shall we begin as hunters or wood-choppers?”\r\n\r\n“Hunters,” answered Herbert. “See Top, who is already at it.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hunt, then,” replied the sailor, “and on our return here we\r\nwill lay in our stock of wood.”\r\n\r\nThis said, the party made three clubs for themselves, and followed Top,\r\nwho was jumping about in the high grass.\r\n\r\nThis time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the stream,\r\nstruck at once into the depths of the forests. The trees were for the\r\nmost part of the pine family. And in certain places, where they stood\r\nin small groups, they were of such a size as to indicate that this\r\ncountry was in a higher latitude than the engineer supposed. Some\r\nopenings, bristling with stumps decayed by the weather, were covered\r\nwith dead timber which formed an inexhaustible reserve of firewood.\r\nThen, the opening passed, the underwood became so thick as to be nearly\r\nimpenetrable.\r\n\r\nTo guide oneself among these great trees without any beaten path was\r\nvery difficult. So the sailer from time to time blazed the route by\r\nbreaking branches in a manner easily recognizable. But perhaps they\r\nwould have done better to have followed the water course, as in the\r\nfirst instance, as, after an hour’s march, no game had been taken. Top,\r\nrunning under the low boughs, only flushed birds that were\r\nunapproachable. Even the couroucous were invisible, and it seemed\r\nlikely that the sailor would be obliged to return to that swampy place\r\nwhere he had fished for tetras with such good luck.\r\n\r\n“Well, Pencroff,” said Neb sarcastically, “if this is all the game you\r\npromised to carry back to my master it won’t take much fire to roast\r\nit!”\r\n\r\n“Wait a bit, Neb,” answered the sailor; “it won’t be game that will be\r\nwanting on our return.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you believe in Mr. Smith?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But you don’t believe be will make a fire?”\r\n\r\n“I will believe that when the wood is blazing in the fire-place.”\r\n\r\n“It will blaze, then, for my master has said so!”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll see!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun had not yet risen to its highest point above the\r\nhorizon. The exploration went on and was signalized by Herbert’s\r\ndiscovery of a tree bearing edible fruit. It was the pistachio pine,\r\nwhich bears an excellent nut, much liked in the temperate regions of\r\nAmerica and Europe. These nuts were perfectly ripe, and Herbert showed\r\nthem to his companions, who feasted on them.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroff, “seaweed for bread, raw mussels for meat, and\r\nnuts for dessert, that’s the sort of dinner for men who haven’t a match\r\nin their pocket!”\r\n\r\n“It’s not worth while complaining,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I don’t complain, my boy. I simply repeat that the meat is a little\r\ntoo scant in this sort of meal.”\r\n\r\n“Top has seen something!” cried Neb, running toward a thicket into\r\nwhich the dog had disappeared barking. With the dog’s barks were\r\nmingled singular gruntings. The sailor and Herbert had followed the\r\nnegro. If it was game, this was not the time to discuss how to cook it,\r\nbut rather how to secure it.\r\n\r\nThe hunters, on entering the brush, saw Top struggling with an animal\r\nwhich he held by the ear. This quadruped was a species of pig, about\r\ntwo feet and a half long, of a brownish black color, somewhat lighter\r\nunder the belly, having harsh and somewhat scanty hair, and its toes at\r\nthis time strongly grasping the soil seemed joined together by\r\nmembranes.\r\n\r\nHerbert thought that he recognized in this animal a cabiai, or\r\nwater-hog, one of the largest specimens of the order of rodents. The\r\nwater-hog did not fight the dog. Its great eyes, deep sank in thick\r\nlayers of fat, rolled stupidly from side to side. And Neb, grasping his\r\nclub firmly, was about to knock the beast down, when the latter tore\r\nloose from Top, leaving a piece of his ear in the dog’s mouth, and\r\nuttering a vigorous grunt, rushed against and overset Herbert and\r\ndisappeared in the wood.\r\n\r\n“The beggar!” cried Pencroff, as they all three darted after the hog.\r\nBut just as they had come up to it again, the water-hog disappeared\r\nunder the surface of a large pond, overshadowed by tall, ancient pines.\r\n\r\nThe three companions stopped, motionless. Top had plunged into the\r\nwater, but the cabiai, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n“Wait,”, said the boy, “he will have to come to the surface to\r\nbreathe.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t he drown?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Herbert, “since he is fin-toed and almost amphibious.\r\nBut watch for him.”\r\n\r\nTop remained in the water, and Pencroff and his companions took\r\nstations upon the bank, to cut off the animal’s retreat, while the dog\r\nswam to and fro looking for him.\r\n\r\nHerbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal came again to the\r\nsurface. Top was upon him at once, keeping him from diving again, and a\r\nmoment later, the cabiai, dragged to the shore, was struck down by a\r\nblow from Neb’s club.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Pencroff with all his heart. “Nothing but a clear fire,\r\nand this gnawer shall be gnawed to the bone.”\r\n\r\nPencroff lifted the carcase to his shoulder, and judging by the sun\r\nthat it must be near 2 o’clock, he gave the signal to return.\r\n\r\nTop’s instinct was useful to the hunters, as, thanks to that\r\nintelligent animal, they were enabled to return upon their steps. In\r\nhalf an hour they had reached the bend of the river. There, as before,\r\nPencroff quickly constructed a raft, although, lacking fire, this\r\nseemed to him a useless job, and, with the raft keeping the current,\r\nthey returned towards the Chimneys. But the sailor had not gone fifty\r\npaces when he stopped and gave utterance anew to a tremendous hurrah,\r\nand extending his hand towards the angle of the cliff—\r\n\r\n“Herbert! Neb! See!” he cried.\r\n\r\nSmoke was escaping and curling above the rocks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGINEER’S INVENTION—ISLAND OR CONTINENT?—DEPARTURE FOR THE\r\nMOUNTAIN—THE FOREST—VOLCANIC SOIL—THE TRAGOPANS—THE MOUFFLONS —THE\r\nFIRST PLATEAU—ENCAMPING FOR THE NIGHT—THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE\r\n\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards, the three hunters were seated before a\r\nsparkling fire. Beside them sat Cyrus Smith and the reporter. Pencroff\r\nlooked from one to the other without saying a word, his cabiai in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my good fellow,” said the reporter, “a fire, a real fire, that\r\nwill roast your game to a turn.”\r\n\r\n“But who lighted it?” said the sailor.\r\n\r\n“The sun.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor could not believe his eyes, and was too stupefied to\r\nquestion the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Had you a burning-glass, sir?” asked Herbert of Cyrus Smith.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy,” said he, “but I made one.”\r\n\r\nAnd he showed his extemporized lens. It was simply the two glasses,\r\nfrom his own watch and the reporter’s, which he had taken out, filled\r\nwith water, and stuck together at the edges with a little clay. Thus he\r\nhad made a veritable burning-glass, and by concentrating the solar rays\r\non some dry moss had set it on fire.\r\n\r\nThe sailor examined the lens; then he looked at the engineer without\r\nsaying a word, but his face spoke for him. If Smith was not a magician\r\nto him, he was certainly more than a man. At last his speech returned,\r\nand he said:—\r\n\r\n“Put that down, Mr. Spilett, put that down in your book!”\r\n\r\n“I have it down,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\nThen, with the help of Neb, the sailor arranged the spit, and dressed\r\nthe cabiai for roasting, like a suckling pig, before the sparkling\r\nfire, by whose warmth, and by the restoration of the partitions, the\r\nChimneys had been rendered habitable.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and his companion had made good use of their day. Smith\r\nhad almost entirely recovered his strength, which he had tested by\r\nclimbing the plateau above. From thence his eye, accustomed to measure\r\nheights and distances, had attentively examined the cone whose summit\r\nhe proposed to reach on the morrow. The mountain, situated about six\r\nmiles to the northwest, seemed to him to reach about 3,500 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, so that an observer posted at its summit, could\r\ncommand a horizon of fifty miles at least. He hoped, therefore, for an\r\neasy solution of the urgent question, “Island or continent?”\r\n\r\nThey had a pleasant supper, and the meat of the cabiai was proclaimed\r\nexcellent; the sargassum and pistachio-nuts completed the repast. But\r\nthe engineer said little; he was planning for the next day. Once or\r\ntwice Pencroff talked of some project for the future, but Smith shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” he said, “we will know how we are situated, and we can act\r\naccordingly.”\r\n\r\nAfter supper, more armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and the\r\nparty lay down to sleep. The morning found them fresh and eager for the\r\nexpedition which was to settle their fate.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready. Enough was left of the cabiai for twenty-four\r\nhours’ provisions, and they hoped to replenish their stock on the way.\r\nThey charred a little linen for tinder, as the watch glasses had been\r\nreplaced, and flint abounded in this volcanic region.\r\n\r\nAt half-past 7 they left the Chimneys, each with a stout cudgel. By\r\nPencroff’s advice, they took the route of the previous day, which was\r\nthe shortest way to the mountain. They turned the southern angle, and\r\nfollowed the left bank of the river, leaving it where it bent to the\r\nsouthwest. They took the beaten path under the evergreens, and soon\r\nreached the northern border of the forest. The soil, flat and swampy,\r\nthen dry and sandy, rose by a gradual slope towards the interior. Among\r\nthe trees appeared a few shy animals, which rapidly took flight before\r\nTop. The engineer called his dog back; later, perhaps, they might hunt,\r\nbut now nothing could distract him from his great object. He observed\r\nneither the character of the ground nor its products; he was going\r\nstraight for the top of the mountain.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o’clock they were clear of the forest, and they halted for a\r\nwhile to observe the country. The mountain was composed of two cones.\r\nThe first was truncated about 2,500 feet up, and supported by fantastic\r\nspurs, branching out like the talons of an immense claw, laid upon the\r\nground. Between these spurs were narrow valleys, thick set with trees,\r\nwhose topmost foliage was level with the flat summit of the first cone.\r\nOn the northeast side of the mountain, vegetation was more scanty, and\r\nthe ground was seamed here and there, apparently with currents of lava.\r\n\r\nOn the first cone lay a second, slightly rounded towards the summit. It\r\nlay somewhat across the other, like a huge hat cocked over the ear. The\r\nsurface seemed utterly bare, with reddish rocks often protruding. The\r\nobject of the expedition was to reach the top of this cone, and their\r\nbest way was along the edge of the spurs.\r\n\r\n“We are in a volcanic country,” said Cyrus Smith, as they began to\r\nclimb, little by little, up the side of the spurs, whose winding summit\r\nwould most readily bring them out upon the lower plateau. The ground\r\nwas strewn with traces of igneous convulsion. Here and there lay\r\nblocks, debris of basalt, pumice-stone, and obsidian. In isolated\r\nclumps rose some few of those conifers, which, some hundreds of feet\r\nlower, in the narrow gorges, formed a gigantic thicket, impenetrable to\r\nthe sun. As they climbed these lower slopes, Herbert called attention\r\nto the recent marks of huge paws and hoofs on the ground.\r\n\r\n“These brutes will make a fight for their territory,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Oh well,” said the reporter, who had hunted tigers in India and lions\r\nin Africa, “we shall contrive to get rid of them. In the meanwhile, we\r\nmust be on our guard.”\r\n\r\nWhile talking they were gradually ascending. The way was lengthened by\r\ndetours around the obstacles which could not be directly surmounted.\r\nSometimes, too, deep crevasses yawned across the ascent, and compelled\r\nthem to return upon their track for a long distance, before they could\r\nfind an available pathway. At noon, when the little company halted to\r\ndine at the foot of a great clump of firs, at whose foot babbled a tiny\r\nbrook, they were still half way from the first plateau, and could\r\nhardly reach it before nightfall. From this point the sea stretched\r\nbroad beneath their feet; but on the right their vision was arrested by\r\nthe sharp promontory of the southeast, which left them in doubt whether\r\nthere was land beyond. On the left they could see directly north for\r\nseveral miles; but the northwest was concealed from them by the crest\r\nof a fantastic spur, which formed a massive abutment to the central\r\ncone. They could, therefore, make no approach as yet to the solving of\r\nthe great question.\r\n\r\nAt 1 o’clock, the ascent was again begun. The easiest route slanted\r\nupwards towards the southwest, through the thick copse. There, under\r\nthe trees, were flying about a number of gallinaceæ of the pheasant\r\nfamily. These were “tragopans,” adorned with a sort of fleshy wattles\r\nhanging over their necks and with two little cylindrical horns behind\r\ntheir eyes. Of these birds, which were about the size of a hen, the\r\nfemale was invariably brown, while the male was resplendent in a coat\r\nof red, with little spots of white. With a well-aimed stone Spilett\r\nkilled one of the tragopans, which the hungry Pencroff looked at with\r\nlonging eyes.\r\n\r\nLeaving the copse, the climbers, by mounting on each other’s shoulders,\r\nascended for a hundred feet up a very steep hill, and reached a\r\nterrace, almost bare of trees, whose soil was evidently volcanic. From\r\nhence, their course was a zigzag towards the east, for the declivity\r\nwas so steep that they had to take every point of vantage. Neb and\r\nHerbert led the way, then came Smith and the reporter; Pencroff was\r\nlast. The animals who lived among these heights, and whose traces were\r\nnot wanting, must have the sure foot and the supple spine of a chamois\r\nor an izard. They saw some to whom Pencroff gave a name of his\r\nown—“Sheep,” he cried.\r\n\r\nThey all had stopped fifty feet from half-a-dozen large animals, with\r\nthick horns curved backwards and flattened at the end, and with woolly\r\nfleece, hidden under long silky fawn-colored hair. They were not the\r\ncommon sheep, but a species widely distributed through the mountainous\r\nregions of the temperate zone. Their name, according to Herbert, was\r\n_Moufflon_.\r\n\r\n“Have they legs and chops?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Then they’re sheep,” said Pencroff. The animals stood motionless and\r\nastonished at their first sight of man. Then, seized with sudden fear,\r\nthey fled, leaping away among the rocks.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye till next time,” cried Pencroff to them, in a tone so comical\r\nthat the others could not forbear laughing.\r\n\r\nAs the ascension continued, the traces of lava were more frequent, and\r\nlittle sulphur springs intercepted their route. At some points sulphur\r\nhad been deposited in crystals, in the midst of the sand and whitish\r\ncinders of feldspar which generally precede the eruption of lava. As\r\nthey neared the first plateau, formed by the truncation of the lower\r\ncone, the ascent became very difficult. By 4 o’clock the last belt of\r\ntrees had been passed. Here and there stood a few dwarfed and distorted\r\npines, which had survived the attacks of the furious winds. Fortunately\r\nfor the engineer and his party, it was a pleasant, mild day; for a high\r\nwind, at that altitude of 3,000 feet, would have interfered with them\r\nsadly. The sky overhead was extremely bright and clear. A perfect calm\r\nreigned around them. The sun was hidden by the upper mountain, which\r\ncast its shadow, like a vast screen, westward to the edge of the sea. A\r\nthin haze began to appear in the east, colored with all the rays of the\r\nsolar spectrum.\r\n\r\nThere were only 500 feet between the explorers and the plateau where\r\nthey meant to encamp for the night, but these 500 were increased to\r\n2,000 and more by the tortuous route. The ground, so to speak, gave way\r\nunder their feet. The angle of ascent was often so obtuse that they\r\nslipped upon the smooth-worn lava. Little by little the evening set in,\r\nand it was almost night when the party, tired out by a seven hours’\r\nclimb, arrived at the top of the first cone.\r\n\r\nNow they must pitch their camp, and think of supper and sleep. The\r\nupper terrace of the mountain rose upon a base of rocks, amid which\r\nthey could soon find a shelter. Firewood was not plenty, yet the moss\r\nand dry thistles, so abundant on the plateau, would serve their turn.\r\nThe sailor built up a fireplace with huge stones, while Neb and Herbert\r\nwent after the combustibles. They soon came back with a load of\r\nthistles; and with flint and steel, the charred linen for tinder, and\r\nNeb to blow the fire, a bright blaze was soon sparkling behind the\r\nrocks. It was for warmth only, for they kept the pheasant for the next\r\nday, and supped off the rest of the cabiai and a few dozen\r\npistachio-nuts.\r\n\r\nIt was only half-past 6 when the meal was ended. Cyrus Smith resolved\r\nto explore, in, the semi-obscurity, the great circular pediment which\r\nupheld the topmost cone of the mountain. Before taking rest, he was\r\nanxious to know whether the base of the cone could be passed, in case\r\nits flanks should prove too steep for ascent. So, regardless of\r\nfatigue, he left Pencroff and Neb to make the sleeping arrangements,\r\nand Spilett to note down the incidents of the day, and taking Herbert\r\nwith him, began to walk around the base of the plateau towards the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThe night was beautiful and still; and not yet very dark. They walked\r\ntogether in silence. Sometimes the plateau was wide and easy, sometimes\r\nso encumbered with rubbish that the two could not walk abreast.\r\nFinally, after twenty minutes tramp, they were brought to a halt. From\r\nthis point the slant of the two cones was equal. To walk around the\r\nmountain upon an acclivity whose angle was nearly seventy-five degrees\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\nBut though they had to give up their flank movement, the chance of a\r\ndirect ascent was suddenly offered to them. Before them opened an\r\nimmense chasm in the solid rock. It was the mouth of the upper crater,\r\nthe gullet, so to speak, through which, when the volcano was active,\r\nthe eruption took place. Inside, hardened lava and scoriæ formed a sort\r\nof natural staircase with enormous steps, by which they might possibly\r\nreach the summit. Smith saw the opportunity at a glance, and followed\r\nby the boy, he walked unhesitatingly into the huge crevasse, in the\r\nmidst of the gathering darkness.\r\n\r\nThere were yet 1,000 feet to climb. Could they scale the interior wall\r\nof the crater? They would try, at all events. Fortunately, the long and\r\nsinuous declivities described a winding staircase, and greatly helped\r\ntheir ascent. The crater was evidently exhausted. Not a puff of smoke,\r\nnot a glimmer of fire, escaped; not a sound or motion in the dark\r\nabyss, reaching down, perhaps, to the centre of the globe. The air\r\nwithin retained no taint of sulphur. The volcano was not only quiet,\r\nbut extinct.\r\n\r\nEvidently the attempt was to succeed. Gradually, as the two mounted the\r\ninner walls, they saw the crater grow larger over their heads. The\r\nlight from the outer sky visibly increased. At each step, so to speak,\r\nwhich they made, new stars entered the field of their vision: The\r\nmagnificent constellations of the southern sky shone resplendent. In\r\nthe zenith glittered the splendid Antares of the Scorpion, and not far\r\noff that Beta of the Centaur, which is believed to be the nearest star\r\nto our terrestrial globe. Then, as the crater opened, appeared\r\nFomalhaut of the Fish, the Triangle, and at last, almost at the\r\nAntarctic pole, the glowing Southern Cross.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly 8 o’clock when they set foot on the summit of the cone.\r\nThe darkness was by this time complete, and they could hardly see a\r\ncouple of miles around them. Was the land an island, or the eastern\r\nextremity of a continent? They could not yet discover. Towards the west\r\na band of cloud, clearly defined against the horizon, deepened the\r\nobscurity, and confounded sea with sky.\r\n\r\nBut at one point of the horizon suddenly appeared a vague light, which\r\nslowly sank as the clouds mounted to the zenith. It was the slender\r\ncrescent of the moon, just about to disappear. But the line of the\r\nhorizon was now cloudless, and as the moon touched it, the engineer\r\ncould see her face mirrored for an instant on a liquid surface. He\r\nseized the boy’s hand—\r\n\r\n“An island!” said he, as the lunar crescent disappeared behind the\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE—THE INTERIOR OF THE CRATER—SEA EVERYWHERE —NO\r\nLAND IN SIGHT—A BIRD’S EVE VIEW OF THE COAST—HYDROGRAPHY AND OROGRAPHY\r\n—IS THE ISLAND INHABITED?—A GEOGRAPHICAL BAPTISM—LINCOLN ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nA half hour later they walked back to the camp. The engineer contented\r\nhimself with saying to his comrades that the country was an island, and\r\nthat to-morrow they would consider what to do. Then each disposed\r\nhimself to sleep, and in this basalt cave, 2,500 feet above sea-level,\r\nthey passed a quiet night in profound repose. The next day, March 30,\r\nafter a hurried breakfast on roast trajopan, they started out for the\r\nsummit of the volcano. All desired to see the isle on which perhaps\r\nthey were to spend their lives, and to ascertain how far it lay from\r\nother land, and how near the course of vessels bound for the\r\narchipelagoes of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIt was about 7 o’clock in the morning when they left the camp. No one\r\nseemed dismayed by the situation. They had faith in themselves, no\r\ndoubt; but the source of that faith was not the same with Smith as with\r\nhis companions. They trusted in him, he in his ability to extort from\r\nthe wilderness around them all the necessaries of life. As for\r\nPencroff, he would not have despaired, since the rekindling of the fire\r\nby the engineer’s lens, if he had found himself upon a barren rock, if\r\nonly Smith was with him.\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said he, “we got out of Richmond without the permission of the\r\nauthorities, and it will be strange if we can’t get away some time from\r\na place where no one wants to keep us!”\r\n\r\nThey followed the route of the day before, flanking the cone till they\r\nreached the enormous crevasse. It was a superb day, and the southern\r\nside of the mountain was bathed in sunlight. The crater, as the\r\nengineer had supposed, was a huge shaft gradually opening to a height\r\nof 1,000 feet above the plateau. From the bottom of the crevasse large\r\ncurrents of lava meandered down the flanks of the mountain, indicating\r\nthe path of the eruptive matter down to the lower valleys which\r\nfurrowed the north of the island.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the crater, which had an inclination of thirty-five or\r\nforty degrees, was easily scaled. They saw on the way traces of ancient\r\nlava, which had probably gushed from the summit of the cone before the\r\nlateral opening had given it a new way of escape. As to the volcano\r\nchimney which communicated with the subterranean abyss, its depth could\r\nnot be estimated by the eye, for it was lost in obscurity; but there\r\nseemed no doubt that the volcano was completely extinct. Before 8\r\no’clock, the party were standing at the summit of the crater, on a\r\nconical elevation of the northern side.\r\n\r\n“The sea! the sea everywhere!” was the universal exclamation. There it\r\nlay, an immense sheet of water around them on every side. Perhaps Smith\r\nhad hoped that daylight would reveal some neighboring coast or island.\r\nBut nothing appeared to the horizon-line, a radius of more than fifty\r\nmiles. Not a sail was in sight. Around the island stretched a desert\r\ninfinity of ocean.\r\n\r\nSilent and motionless, they surveyed every point of the horizon. They\r\nstrained their eyes to the uttermost limit of the ocean. But even\r\nPencroff, to whom Nature had given a pair of telescopes instead of\r\neyes, and who could have detected land even in the faintest haze upon\r\nthe sea-line, could see nothing. Then they looked down upon their\r\nisland, and the silence was broken by Spilett:—\r\n\r\n“How large do you think this island is?”\r\n\r\nIt seemed small enough in the midst of the infinite ocean.\r\n\r\nSmith thought awhile, noticed the circumference of the island, and\r\nallowed for the elevation.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” he said, “if I am not mistaken, the coast of the island\r\nis more than 100 miles around.”\r\n\r\n“Then its surface will be—”\r\n\r\n“That is hard to estimate; the outline is so irregular.”\r\n\r\nIf Smith was right, the island would be about the size of Malta or\r\nZante in the Mediterranean; but it was more irregular than they, and at\r\nthe same time had fewer capes, promontories, points, bays, and creeks.\r\nIts form was very striking. When Spilett drew it they declared it was\r\nlike some fantastic sea beast, some monstrous pteropode, asleep on the\r\nsurface of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe exact configuration of the island may thus be described:—The\r\neastern coast, upon which the castaways had landed, was a decided\r\ncurve, embracing a large bay, terminating at the southeast in a sharp\r\npromontory, which the shape of the land had hidden from Pencroff on his\r\nfirst exploration. On the northeast, two other capes shut in the bay,\r\nand between them lay a narrow gulf like the half-open jaws of some\r\nformidable dog-fish. From northeast to northwest the coast was round\r\nand flat, like the skull of a wild beast; then came a sort of\r\nindeterminate hump, whose centre was occupied by the volcanic mountain.\r\nFrom this point the coast ran directly north and south. For two-thirds\r\nof its length it was bordered by a narrow creek; then it finished in\r\nalong cue, like the tail of a gigantic alligator. This cue formed a\r\nveritable peninsula, which extended more than thirty miles into the\r\nsea, reckoning from the southeastern cape before mentioned. These\r\nthirty miles, the southern coast of the island, described an open bay.\r\nThe narrowest part of the island, between the Chimneys and the creek,\r\non the west, was ten miles wide, but its greatest length, from the jaw\r\nin the northeast to the extremity of the southwestern peninsula, was\r\nnot less than thirty miles.\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of the interior was as follows:—The southern part,\r\nfrom the shore to the mountain, was covered with woods; the northern\r\npart was arid and sandy. Between the volcano and the eastern coast the\r\nparty were surprised to see a lake, surrounded by evergreens, whose\r\nexistence they had not suspected. Viewed from such a height it seemed\r\nto be on the same level with the sea, but, on reflection, the engineer\r\nexplained to his companions that it must be at least 300 feet higher,\r\nfor the plateau on which it lay was as high as that of the coast.\r\n\r\n“So, then, it is a fresh water lake?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the engineer, “for it must be fed by the mountain streams.”\r\n\r\n“I can see a little river flowing into it,” said Herbert, pointing to a\r\nnarrow brook whose source was evidently in the spurs of the western\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\n“True,” said Smith, “and since this brook flows into the lake, there is\r\nprobably some outlet towards the sea for the overflow. We will see\r\nabout that when we go back.”\r\n\r\nThis little winding stream and the river so familiar to them were all\r\nthe watercourses they could see. Nevertheless, it was possible that\r\nunder those-masses of trees which covered two-thirds of the island,\r\nother streams flowed towards the sea. This seemed the more probable\r\nfrom the fertility of the country and its magnificent display of the\r\nflora of the temperate zone. In the northern section there was no\r\nindication of running water; perhaps there might be stagnant pools in\r\nthe swampy part of the northeast, but that was all; in the main this\r\nregion was composed of arid sand-hills and downs, contrasting strongly\r\nwith the fertility of the larger portion.\r\n\r\nThe volcano did not occupy the centre of the island. It rose in the\r\nnorthwest, and seemed to indicate the dividing line of the two zones.\r\nOn the southwest, south, and southeast, the beginnings of the spurs\r\nwere lost in masses of verdure. To the north, on the contrary, these\r\nramifications were plainly visible, subsiding gradually to the level of\r\nthe sandy plain. On this side, too, when the volcano was active, the\r\neruptions had taken place, and a great bed of lava extended as far as\r\nthe narrow jaw which formed the northeastern gulf.\r\n\r\nThey remained for an hour at the summit of the mountain. The island lay\r\nstretched before them like a plan in relief, with its different tints,\r\ngreen for the forests, yellow for the sands, blue for the water. They\r\nunderstood the configuration of the entire island; only the bottoms of\r\nthe shady valleys and the depths of the narrow gorges between the spurs\r\nof the volcano, concealed by the spreading foliage, escaped their\r\nsearching eye.\r\n\r\nThere remained a question of great moment, whose answer would have a\r\ncontrolling influence upon the fortunes of the castaways. Was the\r\nisland inhabited? It was the reporter who put this question, which\r\nseemed already to have been answered in the negative by the minute\r\nexamination which they had just made of the different portions of the\r\nisland. Nowhere could they perceive the handiwork of man; no late\r\nsettlement on the beach, not even a lonely cabin or a fisherman’s hut.\r\nNo smoke, rising on the air, betrayed a human presence. It is true, the\r\nobservers were thirty miles from the long peninsula which extended to\r\nthe southwest, and upon which even Pencroff’s eye could hardly have\r\ndiscovered a dwelling. Nor could they raise the curtain of foliage\r\nwhich covered three-fourths of the island to see whether some village\r\nlay sheltered there. But the natives of these little islands in the\r\nPacific usually live on the coast, and the coast seemed absolutely\r\ndesert. Until they should make a more complete exploration, they might\r\nassume that the island was uninhabited. But was it ever frequented by\r\nthe inhabitants of neighboring islands? This question was difficult to\r\nanswer. No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles. But fifty\r\nmiles could easily be traversed by Malay canoes or by the larger\r\npirogues of the Polynesians. Everything depended upon the situation of\r\nthe island—on its isolation in the Pacific, or its proximity to the\r\narchipelagoes. Could Smith succeed, without his instruments, in\r\ndetermining its latitude and longitude? It would be difficult, and in\r\nthe uncertainty, they must take precautions against an attack from\r\nsavage neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of the island was finished, its configuration\r\ndetermined, a map of it drawn, its size calculated, and the\r\ndistribution of its land and water ascertained. The forests and the\r\nplains had been roughly sketched upon the reporter’s map. They had only\r\nnow to descend the declivities of the mountain, and to examine into the\r\nanimal, vegetable, and mineral resources of the country. But before\r\ngiving the signal of departure, Cyrus Smith, in a calm, grave voice,\r\naddressed his companions.\r\n\r\n“Look, my friends, upon this little corner of the earth, on which the\r\nhand of the Almighty has cast us. Here, perhaps, we may long dwell.\r\nPerhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, should some ship chance to\r\npass. I say _chance_, because this island is of slight importance,\r\nwithout even a harbor for ships. I fear it is situated out of the usual\r\ncourse of vessels, too far south for those which frequent the\r\narchipelagoes of the Pacific, too far north for those bound to\r\nAustralia round Cape Horn. I will not disguise from you our situation.”\r\n\r\n“And you are right, my dear Cyrus,” said the reporter, eagerly. “You\r\nare dealing with men. They trust you, and you can count on them. Can he\r\nnot, my friends?”\r\n\r\n“I will obey you in everyting [sic], Mr. Smith,” said Herbert, taking\r\nthe engineer’s hand.\r\n\r\n“May I lose my name,” said the sailor, “if I shirk my part! If you\r\nchoose, Mr. Smith, we will make a little America here. We will build\r\ncities, lay railroads, establish telegraphs, and some day, when the\r\nisland is transformed and civilized, offer her to the United States.\r\nBut one thing I should like to ask.”\r\n\r\n“What Is that?” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“That we should not consider ourselves any longer as castaways, but as\r\ncolonists.”\r\n\r\nCyrus Smith could not help smiling, and the motion was adopted. Then\r\nSmith thanked his companions, and added that he counted upon their\r\nenergy and upon the help of Heaven.\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s start for the Chimneys,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“One minute, my friends,” answered the engineer; “would it not be well\r\nto name the island, as well as the capes, promontories, and\r\nwater-courses, which we see before us?”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the reporter. “That will simplify for the future the\r\ninstructions which we may have to give or to take.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added the sailor, “it will be something gained to be able to say\r\nwhence we are coming and where we are going. We shall seem to be\r\nsomewhere.”\r\n\r\n“At the Chimneys, for instance,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said the sailor. “That name has been quite convenient\r\nalready, and I was the author of it. Shall we keep that name for our\r\nfirst encampment, Mr. Smith?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pencroff, since you baptized it so.”\r\n\r\n“Good! the others will be easy enough,” resumed the sailor, who was now\r\nin the vein. “Let us give them names like those of the Swiss family\r\nRobinson, whose story Herbert has read me more than once:—’Providence\r\nBay,’ ‘Cochalot Point,’ ‘Cape Disappointment.’“\r\n\r\n“Or rather Mr. Smith’s name, Mr. Spilett’s, or Neb’s,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“My name!” cried Neb, showing his white teeth.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” replied Pencroff, “‘Port Neb’ would sound first-rate! And\r\n‘Cape Gideon’—”\r\n\r\n“I would rather have names, taken from our country,” said the reporter,\r\n“which will recall America to us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Smith, “the principal features, the bays and seas should be\r\nso named. For instance, let us call the great bay to the east Union\r\nBay, the southern indentation Washington Bay, the mountain on which we\r\nare standing Mount Franklin, the lake beneath our feet Lake Grant.\r\nThese names will recall our country and the great citizens who have\r\nhonored it; but for the smaller features, let us choose names which\r\nwill suggest their especial configuration. These will remain in our\r\nmemory and be more convenient at the same time. The shape of the island\r\nis so peculiar that we shall have no trouble in finding appropriate\r\nnames. The streams, the creeks, and the forest regions yet to be\r\ndiscovered we will baptize as they come. What say you, my friends?”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s proposal was unanimously applauded. The inland bay\r\nunrolled like a map before their eyes, and they had only to name the\r\nfeatures of its contour and relief. Spilett would put down the names\r\nover the proper places, and the geographical nomenclature of the island\r\nwould be complete. First, they named the two bays and the mountain as\r\nthe engineer had suggested.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the reporter, “to that peninsula projecting from the\r\nsouthwest I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and to\r\ncall the twisted curve at the termination of it Reptile End, for it is\r\njust like a snake’s tail.”\r\n\r\n“Motion carried,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“And the other extremity of the island,” said Herbert, “the gulf so\r\nlike an open pair of jaws, let us call it Shark Gulf.”\r\n\r\n“Good enough,” said Pencroff, “and we may complete the figure by\r\ncalling the two sides of the gulf Mandible Cape.”\r\n\r\n“But there are two capes,” observed the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Well, we will have them North Mandible and South Mandible.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve put them down,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Now we must name the southwestern extremity of the island,” said\r\nPencroff.\r\n\r\n“You mean the end of Union Bay?” asked. Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Claw Cape,” suggested Neb, who wished to have his turn as godfather.\r\nAnd he had chosen an excellent name; for this Cape was very like the\r\npowerful claw of the fantastic animal to which they had compared the\r\nisland. Pencroff was enchanted with the turn things were taking, and\r\ntheir active imaginations soon supplied other names. The river which\r\nfurnished them with fresh water, and near which the balloon had cast\r\nthem on shore, they called the Mercy, in gratitude to Providence. The\r\nislet on which they first set foot, was Safety Island; the plateau at\r\nthe top of the high granite wall above the Chimneys, from which the\r\nwhole sweep of the bay was visible, Prospect Plateau; and, finally,\r\nthat mass of impenetrable woods which covered Serpentine Peninsula, the\r\nForests of the Far West.\r\n\r\nThe engineer had approximately determined, by the height and position\r\nof the sun, the situation of the island with reference to the cardinal\r\npoints, and had put Union Bay and Prospect Plateau to the east; but on\r\nthe morrow, by taking the exact time of the sun’s rising and setting,\r\nand noting its situation at the time exactly intermediate, he expected\r\nto ascertain precisely the northern point of the island; for, on\r\naccount of its situation on the Southern Hemisphere, the sun at the\r\nmoment of its culmination would pass to the north, and not to the\r\nsouth, as it does in the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nAll was settled, and the colonists were about to descend the mountain,\r\nwhen Pencroff cried:—\r\n\r\n“Why, what idiots we are!”\r\n\r\n“Why so?” said Spilett, who had gotten up and closed his note-book.\r\n\r\n“We have forgotten to baptize our island!”\r\n\r\nHerbert was about to propose to give it the name of the engineer, and\r\nhis companions would have applauded the choice, when Cyrus Smith said\r\nquietly:—\r\n\r\n“Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friends, of the\r\ndefender of American unity! Let us call it Lincoln Island!”\r\n\r\nThey greeted the proposal with three hurrahs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATION OF WATCHES—PENCROFF IS SATISFIED—A SUSPICIOUS SMOKE—THE\r\nCOURSE OF RED CREEK—THE FLORA OF THE ISLAND—ITS FAUNA—MOUNTAIN\r\nPHEASANTS—A KANGAROO CHASE—THE AGOUTI—LAKE GRANT—RETURN TO THE\r\nCHIMNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colonists of Lincoln Island cast a last look about them and walked\r\nonce around the verge of the crater. Half an hour afterwards they were\r\nagain upon the lower plateau, at their encampment of the previous\r\nnight. Pencroff thought it was breakfast time, and so came up the\r\nquestion of regulating the watches of Smith and Spilett. The reporter’s\r\nchronometer was uninjured by the sea water, as he had been cast high up\r\non the sand beyond the reach of the waves. It was an admirable\r\ntime-piece, a veritable pocket chronometer, and Spilett had wound it up\r\nregularly every day. The engineer’s watch, of course, had stopped while\r\nhe lay upon the downs. He now wound it up, and set it at 9 o’clock,\r\nestimating the time approximately by the height of the sun. Spilett was\r\nabout to do the same, when the engineer stopped him.\r\n\r\n“Wait, my dear Spilett,” said he. “You have the Richmond time, have you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Your watch, then, is regulated by the meridian of that city, which is\r\nvery nearly that of Washington?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, keep it so. Wind it up carefully, but do not touch the hands.\r\nThis may be of use to us.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the use of that?” thought the sailor.\r\n\r\nThey made such a hearty meal, that little was left of the meat and\r\npistachio-nuts; but Pencroff did not trouble himself about that. Top,\r\nwho had not been forgotten in the feast, would certainly find some new\r\ngame in the thicket. Besides, the sailor had made up his mind to ask\r\nSmith to make some powder and one or two shot-guns, which, he thought,\r\nwould be an easy matter.\r\n\r\nAs they were leaving the plateau, Smith proposed to his companions to\r\ntake a new road back to the Chimneys. He wished to explore Lake Grant,\r\nwhich lay surrounded so beautifully with trees. They followed the crest\r\nof one of the spurs in which the creek which fed the lake probably had\r\nits source. The colonists employed in conversation only the proper\r\nnames which they had just devised, and found that they could express\r\nthemselves much more easily. Herbert and Pencroff, one of whom was\r\nyoung and the other something of a child, were delighted, and the\r\nsailor said as they walked along:—\r\n\r\n“Well, Herbert, this is jolly! We can’t lose ourselves now, my boy,\r\nsince, whether we follow Lake Grant or get to the Mercy through the\r\nwoods of the Far West, we must come to Prospect Plateau, and so to\r\nUnion Bay.”\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed that, without marching in a squad, the colonists\r\nshould not keep too far apart. Dangerous wild beasts surely inhabited\r\nthe forest recesses, and they must be on their guard. Usually Pencroff,\r\nHerbert, and Neb walked in front, preceded by Top, who poked his nose\r\ninto every corner. The reporter and engineer walked together, the\r\nformer ready to note down every incident, the latter seldom speaking,\r\nand turning aside only to pick up sometimes one thing, sometimes\r\nanother, vegetable or mineral, which he put in his pocket without\r\nsaying a word.\r\n\r\n“What, the mischief, is he picking up?” muttered Pencroff. “There’s no\r\nuse in looking; I see nothing worth the trouble of stooping for.”\r\n\r\nAbout 10 o’clock the little company descended the last declivities of\r\nMount Franklin. A few bushes and trees were scattered over the ground.\r\nThey were walking on a yellowish, calcined soil, forming a plain about\r\na mile long, which extended to the border of the wood. Large fragments\r\nof that basalt which, according to Bischof’s theory, has taken\r\n350,000,000 years to cool, strewed the uneven surface of the plain. Yet\r\nthere was no trace of lava, which had especially found an exit down the\r\nnorthern declivities. Smith thought they should soon reach the creek,\r\nwhich he expected to find flowing under the trees by the plain, when he\r\nsaw Herbert running back, and Neb and the sailor hiding themselves\r\nbehind the rocks.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, my boy?” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Smoke,” answered Herbert. “We saw smoke ascending from among the\r\nrocks, a hundred steps in front.”\r\n\r\n“Men in this region!” cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n“We must not show ourselves till we know with whom we have to deal,”\r\nanswered Smith. “I have more fear than hope of the natives, if there\r\nare any such on the island. Where is Top?”\r\n\r\n“Top is on ahead.”\r\n\r\n“And has not barked?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“That is strange. Still, let us try to call him back.”\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the three had rejoined their companions, and had\r\nhidden themselves, like Neb and Pencroff, behind the basalt rubbish.\r\nThence they saw, very evidently, a yellowish smoke curling into the\r\nair. Top was recalled by a low whistle from his master, who motioned to\r\nhis comrades to wait, and stole forward under cover of the rocks. In\r\nperfect stillness the party awaited the result, when a call from Smith\r\nsummoned them forward. In a moment they were by his side, and were\r\nstruck at once by the disagreeable smell which pervaded the atmosphere.\r\nThis odor, unmistakable as it was, had been sufficient to reassure the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n“Nature is responsible for that fire,” he said, “or rather for that\r\nsmoke. It is nothing but a sulphur spring, which will be good for our\r\nsore throats.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Pencroff; “what a pity I have not a cold!”\r\n\r\nThe colonists walked towards the smoke. There they beheld a spring of\r\nsulphate of soda, which flowed in currents among the rocks, and whose\r\nwaters, absorbing the oxygen of the air, gave off a lively odor of\r\nsulpho-hydric acid. Smith dipped his hand into the spring and found it\r\noily. He tasted it, and perceived a sweetish savor. Its temperature he\r\nestimated at 95° Fahrenheit; and when Herbert asked him on what he\r\nbased his estimate:—\r\n\r\n“Simply, my boy,” said he, “because when I put my hand into this water,\r\nI have no sensation either of heat or of cold. Therefore, it is at the\r\nsame temperature as the human body, that is, about 95°.”\r\n\r\nThen as the spring of sulphur could be put to no present use, the\r\ncolonists walked towards the thick border of the forest, a few hundred\r\npaces distant. There, as they had thought, the brook rolled its bright\r\nlimpid waters between high, reddish banks, whose color betrayed the\r\npresence of oxide of iron. On account of this color, they instantly\r\nnamed the water course Red Creek. It was nothing but a large mountain\r\nbrook, deep and clear, here, flowing quietly over the lands, there,\r\ngurgling amid rocks, or falling in a cascade, but always flowing\r\ntowards the lake. It was a mile and a half long; its breadth varied\r\nfrom thirty to forty feet. Its water was fresh, which argued that those\r\nof the lake would be found the same—a fortunate occurrence, in case\r\nthey should find upon its banks a more comfortable dwelling than the\r\nChimneys.\r\n\r\nThe trees which, a few hundred paces down stream overshadowed the banks\r\nof the creek, belonged principally to the species which abound in the\r\ntemperate zone of Australia or of Tasmania, and belong to those\r\nconifers which clothed the portion of the island already explored, some\r\nmiles around Prospect Plateau. It was now the beginning of April, a\r\nmonth which corresponds in that hemisphere to our October, yet their\r\nleaves had not begun to fall. They were, especially, casuarinæ and\r\neucalypti, some of which, in the ensuing spring, would furnish a\r\nsweetish manna like that of the East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose\r\nin the glades, covered high with that sort of moss which the\r\nNew-Hollanders call _tussocks_; but the cocoa-palm, so abundant in the\r\narchipelagoes of the Pacific, was conspicuous by its absence. Probably\r\nthe latitude of the island was too low.\r\n\r\n“What a pity!” said Herbert, “such a useful tree and such splendid\r\nnuts!”\r\n\r\nThere were flocks of birds on the thin boughs of the eucalypti and the\r\ncasuarinæ, which gave fine play to their wings. Black, white, and grey\r\ncockatoos, parrots and parroquets of all colors, king-birds, birds of\r\nparadise, of brilliant green, with a crowd of red, and blue lories,\r\nglowing with every prismatic color, flew about with deafening clamors.\r\nAll at once, a strange volley of discordant sounds seemed to come from\r\nthe thicket. The colonists heard, one after another, the song of birds,\r\nthe cries of four-footed beasts, and a sort of clucking sound strangely\r\nhuman. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the thicket, forgetting the most\r\nelementary rules of prudence. Happily, there was neither formidable\r\nwild beast nor savage native, but merely half-a-dozen of those mocking\r\nbirds which they recognized as “mountain pheasants.” A few skillfully\r\naimed blows with a stick brought this parody to an end, and gave them\r\nexcellent game for dinner that evening. Herbert also pointed out superb\r\npigeons with bronze-colored wings, some with a magnificent crest,\r\nothers clad in green, like their congeners at Port-Macquarie; but like\r\nthe troops of crows and magpies which flew about, they were beyond\r\nreach. A load of small-shot would have killed hosts of them; but the\r\ncolonists had nothing but stones and sticks, very insufficient weapons.\r\nThey proved even more inadequate when a troop of quadrupeds leaped away\r\nthrough the underbrush with tremendous bounds thirty feet long, so that\r\nthey almost seemed to spring from tree to tree, like squirrels.\r\n\r\n“Kangaroos!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Can you eat them?” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“They make a delicious stew,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\nThe words had hardly escaped his lips, when the sailor, with Neb and\r\nHerbert at his heels, rushed after the kangaroos. Smith tried in vain\r\nto recall them, but equally in vain did they pursue the game, whose\r\nelastic leaps left them far behind. After five minutes’ chase, they\r\ngave it up, out of breath.\r\n\r\n“You see, Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff, “that guns are a necessity. Will\r\nit be possible to make them?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” replied the engineer; “but we will begin by making bows and\r\narrows, and you will soon use them as skilfully as the Australian\r\nhunters.”\r\n\r\n“Bows and arrows!” said Pencroff, with a contemptuous look. “They are\r\nfor children!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be so proud, my friend,” said the reporter. “Bows and arrows\r\nwere sufficient for many centuries for the warfare of mankind. Powder\r\nis an invention of yesterday, while war, unhappily, is as old as the\r\nrace.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true, Mr. Spilett,” said the sailor. “I always speak before I\r\nthink. Forgive me.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Herbert, with his Natural History always uppermost in his\r\nthoughts, returned to the subject of kangaroos.\r\n\r\n“Those which escaped us,” he said, “belong to the species most\r\ndifficult to capture—very large, with long grey hair, but I am sure\r\nthere are black and red kangaroos, rock-kangaroos, kangaroo-rats—”\r\n\r\n“Herbert,” said the sailor, “for me there is only one kind—the\r\n‘kangaroo-on-the-spit’—and that is just what we haven’t got.”\r\n\r\nThey could not help laughing at Professor Pencroff’s new\r\nclassification. He was much cast down at the prospect of dining on\r\nmountain-phesants; but chance was once more kind to him. Top, who felt\r\nhis dinner at stake, rushed hither and thither, his instinct quickened\r\nby sharp appetite. In fact, he would have left very little of what he\r\nmight catch or any one else, had not Neb watched him shrewdly. About 3\r\no’clock he disappeared into the rushes, from which came grunts and\r\ngrowls which indicated a deadly tustle. Neb rushed in, and found Top\r\ngreedily devouring an animal, which in ten seconds more would have\r\ntotally disappeared. But the dog had luckily fallen on a litter, and\r\ntwo more rodents—for to this species did the beasts belong—lay\r\nstrangled on the ground. Neb reappeared in triumph with a rodent in\r\neach hand. They had yellow hair, with patches of green, and the\r\nrudiments of a tail. They were a sort of agouti, a little larger than\r\ntheir tropical congeners, true American hares, with long ears and five\r\nmolar teeth on either side.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Pencroff, “the roast is here; now we can go back to the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nThe journey was resumed. Red Creek still rolled its limped waters under\r\nthe arching boughs of casuarence, bankseas and gigantic gum trees.\r\nSuperb liliaceæ rose, to a height of twenty feet, and other arborescent\r\ntrees of species unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the brook,\r\nwhich murmered gently beneath its leafy cradle. It widened sensibly,\r\nnevertheless, and the mouth was evidently near. As the party emerged\r\nfrom a massive thicket of fine trees, the lake suddenly appeared before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey were now on its left bank, and a picturesque region opened to\r\ntheir view. The smooth sheet of water, about seven miles in\r\ncircumference and 250 acres in extent, lay sleeping among the trees.\r\nTowards the east, across the intermittent screen of verdure, appeared a\r\nshining horizon of sea. To the north the curve of the lake was concave,\r\ncontrasting with the sharp outline of its lower extremity. Numerous\r\naquatic birds frequented the banks of this little Ontario, in which the\r\n“Thousand Isles” of its American original were represented by a rock\r\nemerging from its surface some hundreds of feet from the southern bank.\r\nThere lived in harmony several couples of kingfishers, perched upon\r\nrocks, grave and motionless, watching for fish; then they would plunge\r\ninto the water and dive with a shrill cry, reappearing with the prey in\r\ntheir beaks. Upon the banks of the lake and the island were constantly\r\nstrutting wild ducks, pelicans, water-hens and red-beaks. The waters of\r\nthe lake were fresh and limpid, somewhat dark, and from the concentric\r\ncircles on its surface, were evidently full of fish.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful this lake is!” said Spilett. “We could live on its\r\nbanks.”\r\n\r\n“We will live there!” answered Smith.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, desiring to get back to the Chimneys by the shortest\r\nroute, went down towards the angle formed at the south by the junction\r\nof the banks. They broke a path with much labor through the thickets\r\nand brush wood, hitherto untouched by the hand of man, and walked\r\ntowards the seashore, so as to strike it to the north of Prospect\r\nPlateau. After a two miles’ walk they came upon the thick turf of the\r\nplateau, and saw before them the infinite ocean.\r\n\r\nTo get back to the Chimneys they had to walk across the plateau for a\r\nmile to the elbow formed by the first bend of the Mercy. But the\r\nengineer was anxious to know how and where the overflow of the lake\r\nescaped. It was probable that a river existed somewhere pouring through\r\na gorge in the granite. In fine, the lake was an immense receptacle\r\ngradually filled at the expense of the creek, and its overflow must\r\nsomehow find a way down to the sea. Why should they not utilize this\r\nwasted store of water-power? So they walked up the plateau, following\r\nthe banks of Lake Grant, but after a tramp of a mile, they could find\r\nno outlet.\r\n\r\nIt was now half-past 4, and dinner had yet to be prepared. The party\r\nreturned upon its track, and reached the Chimneys by the left bank of\r\nthe Mercy. Then the fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroff, on whom\r\ndevolved the cooking, in their respective characters of negro and\r\nsailor, skilfully broiled the agouti, to which the hungry explorers did\r\ngreat honor. When the meal was over, and just as they were settling\r\nthemselves to sleep, Smith drew from his pocket little specimens of\r\nvarious kinds of minerals, and said quietly,\r\n\r\n“My friends, this is iron ore, this pyrites, this clay, this limestone,\r\nthis charcoal. Nature gives us these as her part in the common task.\r\nTo-morrow we must do our share!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOP’S CONTRIBUTION—MAKING BOWS AND ARROWS—A BRICK-KILN—A\r\nPOTTERY—DIFFERENT COOKING UTENSILS—THE FIRST BOILED MEAT—MUGWORT—THE\r\nSOUTHERN CROSS—AN IMPORTANT ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now then, Mr. Smith, where shall we begin?” asked Pencroff the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n“At the beginning,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\nAnd this, indeed, was necessary, as the colonists did not even possess\r\nimplements with which to make implements. Neither were they in that\r\ncondition of nature which “having time,” economizes effort; the\r\nnecessities of life must be provided for at once, and, if profiting by\r\nexperience they had nothing to invent, at least they had everything to\r\nmake. Their iron and steel was in the ore, their pottery was in the\r\nclay, their linen and clothes were still to be provided.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that these colonists were _men_, in the\r\nbest sense of the word. The engineer Smith could not have been aided by\r\ncomrades more intelligent, or more devoted and zealous. He had\r\nquestioned them, and knew their ability.\r\n\r\nThe reporter, having learned everything so as to be able to speak of\r\neverything, would contribute largely from his knowledge and skill\r\ntowards the settlement of the island. He would not shirk work; and, a\r\nthorough sportsman, he would follow as a business what he had formerly\r\nindulged in as a pastime. Herbert, a manly lad, already well versed in\r\nnatural science, would contribute his share to the common cause. Neb\r\nwas devotion personified. Adroit, intelligent, indefatigable, robust,\r\nof iron constitution, knowing something of the work in a smithy, his\r\nassistance would be considerable. As to Pencroff, he had sailed every\r\nsea, had been a carpenter in the Brooklyn yards, an assistant tailor on\r\nboard ship, and, during hie leaves of absence, a gardener, farmer,\r\netc.; in short, like every sailor, he was a Jack-of-all-trades.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it would have been hard to bring together five men, more able\r\nto struggle against fate, and more certain to triumph in the end.\r\n\r\n“At the beginning,” Smith had said. And this beginning was the\r\nconstruction of an apparatus which would serve to transform the natural\r\nsubstances. Every one knows what an important part heat plays in these\r\ntransformations. Therefore, as wood and coal were already provided it\r\nwas only necessary to make an oven to utilize them.\r\n\r\n“What good is an oven,” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“To make the pottery that we want,” replied Smith.\r\n\r\n“And how will we make an oven?”\r\n\r\n“With bricks.”\r\n\r\n“And how will we make the bricks?”\r\n\r\n“With the clay. Come, friends. We will set up our factory at the place\r\nof production, so as to avoid carriage. Neb will bring the provisions,\r\nand we shall not lack fire to cook food.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the reporter, “but suppose we lack food, since we have no\r\nhunting implements?”\r\n\r\n“If we only had a knife!” cried the sailor,\r\n\r\n“What, then?” asked Smith.\r\n\r\n“Why, I would make a bow and arrows. And game would be plenty in the\r\nlarder.”\r\n\r\n“A knife. Something that will cut,” said the engineer, as if talking to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his face brightened:\r\n\r\n“Come here, Top,” he called.\r\n\r\nThe dog bounded to his master, and Smith having taken off the collar\r\nwhich the animal had around his neck, broke it into halves, saying:—\r\n\r\n“Here are two knives, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\nFor all response, the sailor gave a couple of cheers. Top’s collar was\r\nmade from a thin piece of tempered steel. All that was therefore\r\nnecessary was to rub it to an edge upon a sand-stone, and then to\r\nsharpen it upon one of finer grain. These kind of stones were readily\r\nprocurable upon the beach, and in a couple of hours the implements of\r\nthe colony consisted of two strong blades, which it was easy to fasten\r\ninto solid handles. The overcoming of this first difficulty was greeted\r\nas a triumph and it was indeed a fortunate event.\r\n\r\nOn setting out, it was the intention of the engineer to return to the\r\nwestern bank of the lake, where he had noticed the clay, of which he\r\nhad secured a specimen. Following the bank of the Mercy they crossed\r\nProspect Plateau, and after a walk of about five miles, they arrived at\r\na glade some 200 paces distant from Lake Grant.\r\n\r\nOn the way, Herbert had discovered a tree from which the South American\r\nIndians make bows. It was the “crejimba,” of the palm family. From it\r\nthey cut long straight branches, which they peeled and shaped into\r\nbows. For cords they took the fibres of the “hibiscus heterophyltus”\r\n(Indian hemp), a malvaceous plant, the fibres of which are as strong as\r\nthe tendons of an animal. Pencroff, having thus provided bows, only\r\nneeded arrows. Those were easily made from straight, stiff branches,\r\nfree from knots, but it was not so easy to arm them with a substitute\r\nfor iron. But Pencroff said that he had accomplished this much, and\r\nthat chance would do the rest.\r\n\r\nThe party had reached the place discovered the day before. The ground\r\nwas composed of that clay which is used in making bricks and tiles, and\r\nwas therefore just the thing for their purpose. The labor was not\r\ndifficult. It was only necessary to scour the clay with sand, mould the\r\nbricks, and then bake them before a wood fire.\r\n\r\nUsually, bricks are pressed in moulds, but the engineer contented\r\nhimself with making these by hand. All this day and the next was\r\nemployed in this work. The clay, soaked in water, was kneaded by the\r\nhands and feet of the manipulators, and then divided into blocks of\r\nequal size. A skilled workman can make, without machinery, as many as\r\n10,000 bricks in twelve hours; but in the two days the brickmakers of\r\nLincoln Island had made but 3,000, which were piled one upon the other\r\nto await the time when they would be dry enough to bake, which would be\r\nin three or four days.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of April, Smith occupied himself in determining the position\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nThe day before he had noted the precise minute at which the sun had\r\nset, allowing for the refraction. On this morning, he ascertained with\r\nequal precision the time of its rising. The intervening time was twelve\r\nhours and twenty-four minutes. Therefore six hours and twelve minutes\r\nafter rising the sun would pass the meridian, and the point in the sky\r\nwhich it would occupy at that instant would be north.\r\n\r\nAt the proper hour Smith marked this point, and by getting two trees in\r\nline obtained a meridian for his future operations.\r\n\r\nDuring the two days preceding the baking they occupied themselves by\r\nlaying in a supply of firewood. Branches were cut from the edge of the\r\nclearing, and all the dead wood under the trees was picked up. And now\r\nand then they hunted in the neighborhood, the more successfully, as\r\nPencroff had some dozens of arrows with very sharp points. It was Top\r\nwho had provided these points by bringing in a porcupine, poor game\r\nenough, but of an undeniable value, thanks to the quills with which it\r\nbristled. These quills were firmly fastened to the ends of the arrows,\r\nand their flight was guided by feathering them with the cockatoo’s\r\nfeathers. The reporter and Herbert soon became expert marksmen, and all\r\nkinds of game, such as cabiais, pigeons, agoutis, heath-cock, etc.,\r\nabounded at the Chimneys. Most of these were killed in that part of the\r\nforest upon the left bank of the Mercy, which they had called Jacamar\r\nWood, after the kingfisher which Pencroff and Herbert had pursued there\r\nduring their first exploration.\r\n\r\nThe meat was eaten fresh, but they preserved the hams of the cabiai by\r\nsmoking them before a fire of green wood, having made them aromatic\r\nwith odorous leaves. Thus, they had nothing but roast after roast, and\r\nthey would have been glad to have heard a pot singing upon the hearth;\r\nbut first they must have the pot, and for this they must have the oven.\r\n\r\nDuring these excursions, the hunters noticed the recent tracks of large\r\nanimals, armed with strong claws, but they could not tell their\r\nspecies; and Smith cautioned them to be prudent, as, doubtless, there\r\nwere dangerous beasts in the forest.\r\n\r\nHe was right. For one day Spilett and Herbert saw an animal resembling\r\na jaguar. But, fortunately, the beast did not attack them, as they\r\ncould hardly have killed it without being themselves wounded. But,\r\nSpilett promised, if he should ever obtain a proper weapon, such as one\r\nof the guns Pencroff begged for, that he would wage relentless war on\r\nall ferocious beasts and rid the island of their presence.\r\n\r\nThey did not do anything to the Chimneys, as the engineer hoped to\r\ndiscover, or to build, if need be, a more convenient habitation, but\r\ncontented themselves by spreading fresh quantities of moss and dry\r\nleaves upon the sand in the corridors, and upon these primitive beds\r\nthe tired workmen slept soundly. They also reckoned the days already\r\npassed on Lincoln Island, and began keeping a calendar. On the 5th of\r\nApril, which was a Wednesday, they had been twelve days upon the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th, the engineer with his companions met at the\r\nplace where the bricks were to be baked. Of course the operation was to\r\nbe conducted in the open air, and not in an oven, or, rather, the pile\r\nof bricks would in itself form a bake-oven. Carefully-prepared faggots\r\nwere laid upon the ground, surrounding the tiers of dry bricks, which\r\nformed a great cube, in which air-holes had been left. The work\r\noccupied the whole day, and it was not until evening that they lit the\r\nfire, which all night long they kept supplied with fuel.\r\n\r\nThe work lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly. Then, as it\r\nwas necessary to let the smoking mass cool, Neb and Pencroff, directed\r\nby Mr. Smith, brought, on a hurdle made of branches, numerous loads of\r\nlimestone which they found scattered in abundance to the north of the\r\nlake. These stones, decomposed by heat, furnished a thick quick-lime,\r\nwhich increased in bulk by slacking, and was fully as pure as if it had\r\nbeen produced by the calcimation of chalk or marble. Mixed with sand in\r\norder to diminish its shrinkage while drying, this lime made an\r\nexcellent mortar.\r\n\r\nBy the 9th of April the engineer had at his disposal a quantity of\r\nlime, all prepared, and some thousands of bricks. They, therefore,\r\nbegan at once the construction of an oven, in which to bake their\r\npottery. This was accomplished without much difficulty; and, five days\r\nlater, the oven was supplied with coal from the open vein, which the\r\nengineer had discovered near the mouth of Red Creek, and the first\r\nsmoke escaped from a chimney twenty feet high. The glade was\r\ntransformed into a manufactory, and Pencroff was ready to believe that\r\nall the products of modern industry would be produced from this oven.\r\n\r\nMeantime the colonists made a mixture of the clay with lime and quartz,\r\nforming pipe-clay, from which they moulded pots and mugs, plates and\r\njars, tubs to hold water, and cooking vessels. Their form was rude and\r\ndefective, but after they had been baked at a high temperature, the\r\nkitchen of the Chimneys found itself provided with utensils as precious\r\nas if they were composed of the finest kaolin.\r\n\r\nWe must add that Pencroff, desirous of knowing whether this material\r\ndeserved its name of pipe-clay, made some large pipes, which he would\r\nhave found perfect, but for the want of tobacco. And, indeed, this was\r\na great privation to the sailor.\r\n\r\n“But the tobacco will come like everything else,” he would say in his\r\nhopeful moments.\r\n\r\nThe work lasted until the 15th of April, and the time was well spent.\r\nThe colonists having become potters, made nothing but pottery. When it\r\nwould suit the engineer to make them smiths they would be smiths. But\r\nas the morrow would be Sunday, and moreover Easter Sunday, all agreed\r\nto observe the day by rest. These Americans were religious men,\r\nscrupulous observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their situation\r\ncould only develop their trust in the Author of all things.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 15th they returned permanently to the Chimneys,\r\nbringing the rest of the pottery back with them, and putting out the\r\noven fire until there should be use for it again. This return was\r\nmarked by the fortunate discovery by the engineer of a substance that\r\nwould answer for tinder, which, we know, is the spongy, velvety pulp of\r\na mushroom of the polypore family. Properly prepared it is extremely\r\ninflammable, especially when previously saturated with gunpowder, or\r\nnitrate or chlorate of potash. But until then they had found no\r\npolypores, nor any fungi that would answer instead. Now, the engineer,\r\nhaving found a certain plant belonging to the mugwort family, to which\r\nbelong wormwood, mint, etc., broke off some tufts, and, handing them to\r\nthe sailor, said:—\r\n\r\n“Here, Pencroff, is something for you.”\r\n\r\nPencroff examined the plant, with its long silky threads and leaves\r\ncovered with a cotton-like down.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Mr. Smith?” he asked. “Ah, I know! It’s tobacco!”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Smith; “it is Artemesia wormwood, known to science as\r\nChinese mugwort, but to us it will be tinder.”\r\n\r\nThis mugwort, properly dried, furnished a very inflammable substance,\r\nespecially after the engineer had impregnated it with nitrate of\r\npotash, which is the same as saltpetre, a mineral very plenty on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThis evening the colonists, seated in the central chamber, supped with\r\ncomfort. Neb had prepared some agouti soup, a spiced ham, and the\r\nboiled corms of the “caladium macrorhizum,” an herbaceous plant of the\r\narad family, which under the tropics takes a tree form. These corms,\r\nwhich are very nutritious, had an excellent flavor, something like that\r\nof Portland sago, and measurably supplied the place of bread, which the\r\ncolonists were still without.\r\n\r\nSupper finished, before going to sleep the party took a stroll upon the\r\nbeach. It was 8 o’clock, and the night was magnificent. The moon, which\r\nhad been full five days before, was about rising, and in the zenith,\r\nshining resplendent above the circumpolar constellations, rode the\r\nSouthern Cross. For some moments the engineer gazed at it attentively.\r\nAt its summit and base were two stars of the first magnitude, and on\r\nthe left arm and the right, stars, respectively, of the second\r\nmagnitude and the third. Then, after some reflection, he said:—\r\n\r\n“Herbert, is not to-day the 15th of April?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered the lad.\r\n\r\n“Then, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four days in\r\nthe year when the mean and real time are the same; that is to say, my\r\nboy, that to-morrow, within some seconds of noon by the clocks, the sun\r\nwill pass the meridian. If, therefore, the weather is clear, I think I\r\nwill be able to obtain the longitude of the island within a few\r\ndegrees.”\r\n\r\n“Without a sextant or instruments?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the engineer. And since it is so clear, I will try\r\nto-night to find our latitude by calculating the height of the Cross,\r\nthat is, of the Southern Pole, above the horizon. You see, my friends,\r\nbefore settling down, it will not do to be content with determining\r\nthis land to be an island; we must find out its locality.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, instead of building a house, it will be better to build a\r\nship, if we are within a hundred miles of an inhabited land.”\r\n\r\n“That is why I am now going to try to get the latitude of the place,\r\nand to-morrow noon to calculate the longitude.”\r\n\r\nIf the engineer had possessed a sextant, the work would have been easy,\r\nas this evening, by taking the height of the pole, and to-morrow by the\r\nsun’s passage of the meridian, he would have the co-ordinates of the\r\nisland. But, having no instruments he must devise something. So\r\nreturning to the Chimneys, he made, by the light of the fire, two\r\nlittle flat sticks which he fastened together with a thorn, in a way\r\nthat they could be opened and shut like compasses, and returned with\r\nthem to the beach. But as the sea horizon was hidden from this point by\r\nClaw Cape, the engineer determined to make his observation from\r\nProspect Plateau, leaving, until the next day, the computation of the\r\nheight of the latter, which could easily be done by elementary\r\ngeometry.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, therefore, went to the edge of the plateau which faced\r\nthe southeast, overlooking the fantastic rocks bordering the shore. The\r\nplace rose some fifty feet above the right bank of the Mercy, which\r\ndescended, by a double slope, to the end of Claw Cape and to the\r\nsouthern boundary of the island. Nothing obstructed the vision, which\r\nextended over half the horizon from the Cape to Reptile Promontory. To\r\nthe south, this horizon, lit by the first rays of the moon, was sharply\r\ndefined against the sky. The Cross was at this time reversed, the star\r\nAlpha being nearest the pole. This constellation is not situated as\r\nnear to the southern as the polar star is to the northern pole; Alpha\r\nis about 27° from it, but Smith knew this and could calculate\r\naccordingly. He took care also to observe it at the instant when it\r\npassed the meridian under the pole, thus simplifying the operation.\r\n\r\nThe engineer opened the arms of his compass so that one pointed to the\r\nhorizon and the other to the star, and thus obtained the angle of\r\ndistance which separated them. And in order to fix this distance\r\nimmovably, he fastened these arms, respectively, by means of thorns, to\r\na cross piece of wood. This done, it was only necessary to calculate\r\nthe angle obtained, bringing the observation to the level of the sea so\r\nas to allow for the depression of the horizon caused by the height of\r\nthe plateau. The measurement of this angle would thus give the height\r\nof Alpha, or the pole, above the horizon; or, since the latitude of a\r\npoint on the globe is always equal to the height of the pole above the\r\nhorizon at that point, the latitude of the island.\r\n\r\nThis calculation was postponed until the next day, and by 10 o’clock\r\neverybody slept profoundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEASURE OF THE GRANITE WALL—AN APPLICATION OF THE THEOREM OF\r\nSIMILAR TRIANGLES—THE LATITUDE OF THE ISLAND—AN EXCURSION TO THE\r\nNORTH—AN OYSTER-BED—PLANS FOR THE FUTURE—THE SUN’S PASSAGE OF THE\r\nMERIDIAN—THE CO-ORDINATES OF LINCOLN ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the next day, Easter Sunday, the colonists left the\r\nChimneys and went to wash their linen and clean their clothing. The\r\nengineer intended to make some soap as soon as he could obtain some\r\nsoda or potash and grease or oil. The important question of renewing\r\ntheir wardrobes would be considered in due time. At present they were\r\nstrong, and able to stand hard wear for at least six months longer. But\r\neverything depended on the situation of the island as regarded\r\ninhabited countries, and that would be determined this day, providing\r\nthe weather permitted.\r\n\r\nThe sun rising above the horizon, ushered in one of those glorious days\r\nwhich seem like the farewell of summer. The first thing to be done was\r\nto measure the height of Prospect Plateau above the sea.\r\n\r\n“Do you not need another pair of compasses?” asked Herbert, of the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy,” responded the latter, “this time we will try another and\r\nnearly as precise a method.”\r\n\r\nPencroff, Neb, and the reporter were busy at other things; but Herbert,\r\nwho desired to learn, followed the engineer, who proceeded along the\r\nbeach to the base of the granite wall.\r\n\r\nSmith was provided with a pole twelve feet long, carefully measured off\r\nfrom his own height, which he knew to a hair. Herbert carried a\r\nplumb-line made from a flexible fibre tied to a stone. Having reached a\r\npoint 20 feet from the shore and 500 feet from the perpendicular\r\ngranite wall, Smith sunk the pole two feet in the sand, and, steadying\r\nit carefully, proceeded to make it plumb with the horizon. Then, moving\r\nback to a spot where, stretched upon the sand, he could sight over the\r\ntop of the pole to the edge of the cliff, bringing the two points in\r\nline, he carefully marked this place with a stone. Then addressing\r\nHerbert,\r\n\r\n“Do you know the first principles of geometry?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Slightly, sir,” answered Herbert, not wishing to seem forward.\r\n\r\n“Then you remember the relation of similar triangles?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered Herbert. “Their like sides are proportional.”\r\n\r\n“Right, my boy. And I have just constructed two similar right angled\r\ntriangles:—the smaller has for its sides the perpendicular pole and the\r\ndistances from its base and top to the stake; the second has the wall\r\nwhich we are about to measure, and the distances from its base and\r\nsummit to the stake, which are only the prolongation of the base and\r\nhypothenuse of the first triangle.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” cried Herbert. “As the distance from the stake to the\r\npole is proportional to the distance from the stake to the base of the\r\nwall, so the height of the wall is proportional to the height of the\r\nrod.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” replied the engineer, “and after measuring the first two\r\ndistances, as we know the height of the pole, we have only to calculate\r\nthe proportion in order to find the height of the wall.”\r\n\r\nThe measurements were made with the pole and resulted in determining\r\nthe distances from the stake to the foot of the pole and the base of\r\nthe wall to be 15 and 500 feet respectively. The engineer and Herbert\r\nthen returned to the Chimneys, where the former, using a flat stone and\r\na bit of shell to figure with, determined the height of the wall to be\r\n333.33 feet.\r\n\r\nThen taking the compasses, and carefully measuring the angle which he\r\nhad obtained the night before, upon a circle which he had divided into\r\n360 parts, the engineer found that this angle, allowing for the\r\ndifferences already explained, was 53°. Which, subtracted from 90°—the\r\ndistance of the pole from the equator—gave 37° as the latitude of\r\nLincoln Island. And making an allowance of 5° for the imperfections of\r\nthe observations, Smith, concluded it to be situated between the 35th\r\nand the 40th parallel of south latitude.\r\n\r\nBut, in order to establish the co-ordinates of the island, the\r\nlongitude also must be taken. And this the engineer determined to do\r\nwhen the sun passed the meridian at noon.\r\n\r\nThey therefore resolved to spend the morning in a walk, or rather an\r\nexploration of that part of the island situated to the north of Shark\r\nGulf and the lake; and, if they should have time, to push on as far as\r\nthe western side of South Mandible Cape. They would dine on the downs\r\nand not return until evening.\r\n\r\nAt half-past 8 the little party set out, following the edge of the\r\nchannel. Opposite, upon Safety Islet, a number of birds of the\r\nsphemiscus family strutted gravely about. There were divers, easily\r\nrecognizable, by their disagreeable cry, which resembled the braying of\r\nan ass. Pencroff, regarding them with gastronomic intent, was pleased\r\nto learn that their flesh, though dark colored, was good to eat. They\r\ncould also see amphibious animals, which probably were seals, crawling\r\nover the sand. It was not possible to think of these as food, as their\r\noily flesh is detestable; nevertheless Smith observed them carefully,\r\nand without disclosing his plans to the others, he announced that they\r\nwould very soon, make a visit to the island. The shore followed by the\r\ncolonists was strewn with mollusks, which would have delighted a\r\nmalacologist. But, what was more important, Neb discovered, about four\r\nmiles from the Chimneys, among the rocks, a bed of oysters, left bare\r\nby the tide.\r\n\r\n“Neb hasn’t lost his day,” said Pencroff, who saw that the bed extended\r\nsome distance.\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed, a happy discovery,” remarked the reporter. “And when we\r\nremember that each oyster produces fifty or sixty thousand eggs a year,\r\nthe supply is evidently inexhaustable.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t think the oyster is very nourishing,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Smith. “Oysters contain very little azote, and it would\r\nbe necessary for a man living on them alone to eat at least fifteen or\r\nsixteen dozen every day.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroff, “we could swallow dozens and dozens of these and\r\nnot exhaust the bed. Shall we have some for breakfast?”\r\n\r\nAnd, without waiting for an answer, which he well knew would be\r\naffirmative, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of these mollusks\r\nfrom the rocks, and placed them with the other provisions for\r\nbreakfast, in a basket which Neb had made from the hibiscus fibres.\r\nThen they continued along the shore between the downs and the sea.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Smith looked at his watch, so as to be ready for the\r\nnoon observation.\r\n\r\nAll this portion of the island, as far as South Mandible Cape, was\r\ndesert, composed of nothing but sand and shells, mixed with the debris\r\nof lava. A few sea birds, such as the sea-gulls and albatross,\r\nfrequented the shore, and some wild ducks excited the covetousness of\r\nPencroff. He tried to shoot some, but unsuccessfully, as they seldom\r\nlit, and he could not hit them flying.\r\n\r\nThis made the sailor say to the engineer:—\r\n\r\n“You see, Mr. Smith, how much we need guns!”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, Pencroff,” answered the reporter, “but it rests with you.\r\nYou find iron for the barrels, steel for the locks, saltpetre, charcoal\r\nand sulphur for the powder, mercury and nitric acid for the fulminate,\r\nand last of all, lead for the balls, and Mr. Smith will make us guns of\r\nthe best quality.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we could probably find all these substances on the island,” said\r\nthe engineer. “But it requires fine tools to make such a delicate\r\ninstrument as a firearm. However, we will see after awhile.”\r\n\r\n“Why, why did we throw the arms and everything else, even our\r\npenknives, out of the balloon?” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“If we hadn’t, the balloon would have thrown us into the sea,” answered\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“So it would, my boy,” answered the sailor; and then another idea\r\noccurring to him:—\r\n\r\n“I wonder what Mr. Forster and his friend thought,” he said, “the next\r\nday, when they found they balloon had escaped?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what they thought,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“It was my plan,” cried Pencroff, with a satisfied air.\r\n\r\n“And a good plan it was, Pencroff,” interrupted the reporter, laughing,\r\n“to drop us here!”\r\n\r\n“I had rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners!” exclaimed\r\nthe sailor, “especially since Mr. Smith has been kind enough to rejoin\r\nus!”\r\n\r\n“And I, too,” cried the reporter. “After all, what do we lack here?\r\nNothing.”\r\n\r\n“That means—everything,” answered the sailor, laughing and shrugging\r\nhis shoulders. “But some day we will get away from this place.”\r\n\r\n“Sooner, perhaps, than you think, my friends,” said the engineer, “if\r\nLincoln Island is not very far from an inhabited archipelego or a\r\ncontinent. And we will find that out within an hour. I have no map of\r\nthe Pacific, but I have a distinct recollection of its southern\r\nportion. Yesterday’s observation places the island in the latitude of\r\nNew Zealand and Chili. But the distance between these two countries is\r\nat least 6,000 miles. We must therefore determine what point in this\r\nspace the island occupies, and that I hope to get pretty soon from the\r\nlongitude.\r\n\r\n“Is not the Low Archipelago nearest us in latitude,” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the engineer, “but it is more than 1,200 miles distant.”\r\n\r\n“And that way?” inquired Neb, who followed the conversation with great\r\ninterest, pointing towards the south.\r\n\r\n“Nothing!” answered Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, indeed,” added the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Well, Cyrus,” demanded the reporter, “if we find Lincoln Island to be\r\nonly 200 or 300 miles from New Zealand or Chili?”\r\n\r\n“We will build a ship instead of a house, and Pencroff shall command\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Mr. Smith,” cried the sailor; “I am all ready to be\r\ncaptain, provided you build something seaworthy.”\r\n\r\n“We will, if it is necessary,” answered Smith.\r\n\r\nWhile these men, whom nothing could discourage, were talking, the hour\r\nfor taking the observation approached. Herbert could not imagine how\r\nMr. Smith would be able to ascertain the time of the sun’s passage of\r\nthe meridian of the island without a single instrument. It was 11\r\no’clock, and the party, halting about six miles from the Chimneys, not\r\nfar from the place where they had found the engineer after his\r\ninexplicable escape, set about preparing breakfast. Herbert found fresh\r\nwater in a neighboring brook, and brought some back in a vessel which\r\nNeb had with him.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the engineer made ready for his astronomical observation. He\r\nchose a smooth dry place upon the sand, which the sea had left\r\nperfectly level. It was no more necessary, however, for it to be\r\nhorizontal, than for the rod which he stuck in the sand to be\r\nperpendicular. Indeed, the engineer inclined the rod towards the south\r\nor away from the sun, as it must not be forgotten that the colonists of\r\nLincoln Island, being in the Southern Hemisphere, saw the orb of day\r\ndescribe his diurnal arc above the northern horizon.\r\n\r\nThen Herbert understood how by means of the shadow of the rod on the\r\nsand, the engineer would be able to ascertain the culmination of the\r\nsun, that is to say, its passage of the meridian of the island, or, in\r\nother words, the _time_ of the place. For the moment that the shadow\r\nobtained its minimum length it would be noon, and all they had to do\r\nwas to watch carefully the end of the shadow. By inclining the rod from\r\nthe sun Smith had made the shadow longer, and therefore its changes\r\ncould be the more readily noted.\r\n\r\nWhen he thought it was time, the engineer knelt down upon the sand and\r\nbegan marking the decrease in the length of the shadow by means of\r\nlittle wooden pegs. His companions, bending over him, watched the\r\noperation with the utmost interest.\r\n\r\nThe reporter, chronometer in hand, stood ready to mark the minute when\r\nthe shadow would be shortest. Now, as this 16th of April was a day when\r\nthe true and mean time are the same, Spilett’s watch would give the\r\ntrue time of Washington, and greatly simplify the calculation.\r\n\r\nMeantime the shadow diminished little by little, and as soon as Smith\r\nperceived it begin to lengthen he exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“Now!”\r\n\r\n“One minute past 5,” answered the reporter.\r\n\r\nNothing then remained but the easy work of summing up the result. There\r\nwas, as we have seen, five hours difference between the meridian of\r\nWashington and that of the island. Now, the sun passes around the earth\r\nat the rate of 15° an hour. Fifteen multiplied by five gives\r\nseventy-five. And as Washington is in 77° 3’ 11” from the meridian of\r\nGreenwich, it follows that the island was in the neighborhood of\r\nlongitude 152° west.\r\n\r\nSmith announced this result to his companions, and, making the same\r\nallowance as before, he was able to affirm that the bearing of the\r\nisland was between the 35° and 37° of south latitude, and between the\r\n150° and 155° of west longitude.\r\n\r\nThe difference in this calculation, attributable to errors in\r\nobservation, was placed, as we have seen, at 5° or 300 miles in each\r\ndirection. But this error did not influence the conclusion that Lincoln\r\nIsland was so far from any continent or archipelago that they could not\r\nattempt to accomplish the distance in a small boat.\r\n\r\nIn fact, according to the engineer, they were at least 1,200 miles from\r\nTahiti and from the Low Archipelago, fully 1,800 miles from New\r\nZealand, and more than 4,500 miles from the coast of America.\r\n\r\nAnd when Cyrus Smith searched his memory, he could not remember any\r\nisland in the Pacific occupying the position of Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER SETS IN—THE METALLUGRIC QUESTION—THE EXPLORATION OF SAFETY\r\nISLAND—A SEAL HUNT—CAPTURE OF AN ECHIDNA—THE AI—THE CATALONIAN\r\nMETHOD—MAKING IRON AND STEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first words of the sailor, on the morning of the 17th of April,\r\nwere:—\r\n\r\n“Well, what are we going to do to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Whatever Mr. Smith chooses,” answered the reporter.\r\n\r\nThe companions of the engineer, having been brickmakers and potters,\r\nwere about to become metal-workers.\r\n\r\nThe previous day, after lunch, the party had explored as far as the\r\nextremity of Mandible Cape, some seven miles from the Chimneys. The\r\nextensive downs here came to an end and the soil appeared volcanic.\r\nThere were no longer high walls, as at Prospect Plateau, but the narrow\r\ngulf between the two capes was enframed by a fantastic border of the\r\nmineral matter discharged from the volcano. Having reached this point,\r\nthe colonists retraced their steps to the Chimneys, but they could not\r\nsleep until the question whether they should look forwards to leaving\r\nLincoln Island had been definitely settled.\r\n\r\nThe 1,200 miles to the Low Archipelago was a long distance. And now, at\r\nthe beginning of the stormy season, a small boat would certainly not be\r\nable to accomplish it. The building of a boat, even when the proper\r\ntools are provided, is a difficult task, and as the colonists had none\r\nof these, the first thing to do was to make hammers, hatchets, adzes,\r\nsaws, augers, planes, etc., which would take some time. It was\r\ntherefore decided to winter on Lincoln Island, and to search for a more\r\ncomfortable dwelling than the Chimneys in which to live during the\r\ninclement weather.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to utilize the iron ore which the engineer had\r\ndiscovered, by transforming it into iron and steel.\r\n\r\nIron ore is usually found in combination with oxygen or sulphur. And it\r\nwas so in this instance, as of the two specimens brought back by Cyrus\r\nSmith one was magnetic iron, and the other pyrites or sulphuret of\r\niron. Of these, it was the first kind, the magnetic ore, or oxide of\r\niron, which must be reduced by coal, that is to say, freed from the\r\noxygen, in order to obtain the pure metal. This reduction is performed\r\nby submitting the ore to a great heat, either by the Catalonian method,\r\nwhich has the advantage of producing the metal at one operation, or by\r\nmeans of blast furnaces which first smelt the ore, and then the iron,\r\ncarrying off the 3 or 4 per cent of coal combined with it.\r\n\r\nThe engineer wanted to obtain iron in the shortest way possible. The\r\nore he had found was in itself very pure and rich. Such ore is found in\r\nrich grey masses, yielding a black dust crystallized in regular\r\noctahedrons, highly magnetic, and in Europe the best quality of iron is\r\nmade from it. Not far from this vein was the coal field previously\r\nexplored by the colonists, so that every facility existed for the\r\ntreatment of the ore.\r\n\r\n“Then, sir, are we going to work the iron?” questioned Pencroff. “Yes,\r\nmy friend,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But first we will do something I think you will enjoy—have a seal hunt\r\non the island.”\r\n\r\n“A seal hunt!” cried the sailor, addressing Spilett “Do we need seals\r\nto make iron?”\r\n\r\n“It seems so, since Cyrus has said it,” replied the reporter.\r\n\r\nBut as the engineer had already left the Chimneys, Pencroff prepared\r\nfor the chase without gaining an explanation.\r\n\r\nSoon the whole party were gathered upon the beach at a point where the\r\nchannel could be forded at low water without wading deeper than the\r\nknees. This was Smith’s first visit to the islet upon which his\r\ncompanions had been thrown by the balloon. On their landing, hundreds\r\nof penguins looked fearlessly at them, and the colonists armed with\r\nclubs could have killed numbers of these birds, but it would have been\r\nuseless slaughter, and it would not do to frighten the seals which were\r\nlying on the sand some cable lengths away. They respected also certain\r\ninnocent-looking sphemiscus, with flattened side appendages, mere\r\napologies for wings, and covered with scale-like vestiges of feathers.\r\n\r\nThe colonists marched stealthily forward over ground riddled with holes\r\nwhich formed the nests of aquatic birds. Towards the end of the island,\r\nblack objects, like moving rocks, appeared above the surface of the\r\nwater, they were the seals the hunters wished to capture.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to allow them to land, as, owing to their shape, these\r\nanimals, although capital swimmers and difficult to seize in the sea,\r\ncan move but slowly on the shore. Pencroff, who knew their habits,\r\ncounselled waiting until the seals were sunning themselves asleep on\r\nthe sand. Then the party could manage so as to cut off their retreat\r\nand despatch them with a blow on the muzzle. The hunters therefore hid\r\nthemselves behind the rocks and waited quietly.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour half a dozen seals crawled on to the sand, and\r\nPencroff and Herbert went off round the point of the island so as to\r\ncut off their retreat, while the three others, hidden by the rocks,\r\ncrept forward to the place of encounter.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the tall form of the sailor was seen. He gave a shout, and the\r\nengineer and his companions hurriedly threw themselves between the\r\nseals and the sea. They succeeded in beating two of the animals to\r\ndeath, but the others escaped.\r\n\r\n“Here are your seals, Mr. Smith,” cried the sailor, coming forward.\r\n\r\n“And now we will make bellows,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Bellows!” exclaimed the sailor. “These seals are in luck.”\r\n\r\nIt was, in effect, a huge pair of bellows, necessary in the reduction\r\nof the ore, which the engineer expected to make from the skins of the\r\nseals. They were medium-sized, about six feet long, and had heads\r\nresembling those of dogs. As it was useless to burden themselves with\r\nthe whole carcass, Neb and Pencroff resolved to skin them on the spot,\r\nwhile Smith and the reporter made the exploration of the island.\r\n\r\nThe sailor and the negro acquitted themselves well, and three hours\r\nlater Smith had at his disposal two seal skins, which he intended to\r\nuse just as they were, without tanning.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, waiting until low water, re-crossed the channel and\r\nreturned to the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to stretch the skins upon the wooden frames and\r\nto sew them so as to make them sufficiently air-tight. Smith had\r\nnothing but the two knives to work with, yet he was so ingenious and\r\nhis companions aided him so intelligently, that, three days later, the\r\nnumber of implements of the little colony was increased by a bellows\r\nintended to inject air into the midst of the ore during its treatment\r\nby heat—a requisite to the success of the operation.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning of the 20th of April that what the reporter\r\ncalled in his notes the “iron age” began. The engineer had decided to\r\nwork near the deposits of coal and iron, which were situated at the\r\nbase of the northeasterly spurs of Mount Franklin, six miles from the\r\nChimneys. And as it would not be possible to go back and forth each\r\nday, it was decided to camp upon the ground in a temporary hut, so that\r\nthey could attend to the important work night and day.\r\n\r\nThis settled, they left in the morning, Neb and Pencroff carrying the\r\nbellows and a stock of provisions, which latter they would add to on\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nThe road led through the thickest part of Jacamar Wood, in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction. It was as well to break a path which would\r\nhenceforth be the most direct route between Prospect Plateau and Mount\r\nFranklin. The trees belonging to the species already recognized were\r\nmagnificent, and Herbert discovered another, the dragon tree, which\r\nPencroff designated as an “overgrown onion,” which, notwithstanding its\r\nheight, belongs to the same family of liliaceous plants as the onion,\r\nthe civet, the shallot, or the asparagus. These dragon trees have\r\nligneous roots which, cooked, are excellent, and which, fermented,\r\nyield a very agreeable liquor. They therefore gathered some.\r\n\r\nIt took the entire day to traverse the wood, but the party were thus\r\nable to observe its fauna and flora. Top, specially charged to look\r\nafter the fauna, ran about in the grass and bushes, flushing all kinds\r\nof game. Herbert and Spilett shot two kangaroos and an animal which was\r\nlike a hedge-hog, in that it rolled itself into a ball and erected its\r\nquills, and like an ant-eater, in that it was provided with claws for\r\ndigging, a long and thin snout terminating in a beak, and an extensile\r\ntongue furnished with little points, which enabled it to hold insects.\r\n\r\n“And what does it look like boiling in the pot?” asked Pencroff,\r\nnaturally.\r\n\r\n“Like an excellent piece of beef,” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want to know any more than that,” said the sailor.\r\n\r\nDuring the march they saw some wild boars, but they did not attempt to\r\nattack the little troupe, and it seemed that they were not going to\r\nhave any encounter with savage beasts, when the reporter saw in a dense\r\nthicket, among the lower branches of a tree, an animal which he took to\r\nbe a bear, and which he began tranquilly to sketch. Fortunately for\r\nSpilett, the animal in question did not belong to that redoubtable\r\nfamily of plantigrades. It was an ai, better known as a sloth, which\r\nhas a body like that of a large dog, a rough and dirty-colored skin,\r\nthe feet armed with strong claws which enable it to grasp the branches\r\nof trees and feed upon the leaves. Having identified the animal without\r\ndisturbing it, Spilett struck out “bear” and wrote “ai” under his\r\ndrawing and the route was resumed.\r\n\r\nAt 5 o’clock Smith called a halt. They were past the forest and at the\r\nbeginning of the massive spurs which buttressed Mount Franklin towards\r\nthe east. A few hundred paces distant was Red Creek; so drinking water\r\nwas not wanting.\r\n\r\nThe camp was made. In less than an hour a hut, constructed from the\r\nbranches of the tropical bindweed, and stopped with loam, was erected\r\nunder the trees on the edge of the forest. They deferred the geological\r\nwork until the next day. Supper was prepared, a good fire blazed before\r\nthe hut, the spit turned, and at 8 o’clock, while one of the party kept\r\nthe fire going, in case some dangerous beast should prowl around, the\r\nothers slept soundly.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Smith, accompanied by Herbert, went to look for the\r\nplace where they had found the specimen of ore. They found the deposit\r\non the surface, near the sources of the creek, close to the base of one\r\nof the northeast buttresses. This mineral, very rich in iron, enclosed\r\nin its fusible vein-stone, was perfectly suited to the method of\r\nreduction which the engineer intended to employ, which was the\r\nsimplified Catalonian process practised in Corsica.\r\n\r\nThis method properly required the construction of ovens and crucibles\r\nin which the ore and the coal, placed in alternate layers, were\r\ntransformed and reduced. But Smith proposed to simplify matters by\r\nsimply making a huge cube of coal and ore, into the centre of which the\r\nair from the bellows would be introduced. This was, probably, what\r\nTubal Cain did. And a process which gave such good results to Adam’s\r\ngrandson would doubtless succeed with the colonists of Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nThe coal was collected with the same facility as the ore, and the\r\nlatter was broken into little pieces and the impurities picked from it.\r\nThen the coal and ore were heaped together in successive layers—just as\r\na charcoal-burner arranges his wood. Thus arranged, under the influence\r\nof the air from the bellows, the coal would change into carbonic acid,\r\nthen into oxide of carbon, which would release the oxygen from the\r\noxide of iron.\r\n\r\nThe engineer proceeded in this manner. The sealskin bellows, furnished\r\nwith a pipe of refractory earth (an earth difficult of fusion), which\r\nhad previously been prepared at the pottery, was set up close to the\r\nheap of ore. And, moved by a mechanism consisting of a frame,\r\nfibre-cords, and balance-weight, it injected into the mass a supply of\r\nair, which, by raising the temperature, assisted the chemical\r\ntransformation which would give the pure metal.\r\n\r\nThe operation was difficult. It took all the patience and ingenuity of\r\nthe colonists to conduct it properly; but finally it succeeded, and the\r\nresult was a pig of iron in a spongy state, which must be cut and\r\nforged in order to expel the liquified gangue. It was evident that\r\nthese self-constituted smiths wanted a hammer, but they were no worse\r\noff than the first metallurgist, and they did as he must have done.\r\n\r\nThe first pig, fastened to a wooden handle, served as a hammer with\r\nwhich to forge the second upon an anvil of granite, and they thus\r\nobtained a coarse metal, but one which could be utilized.\r\n\r\nAt length, after much trouble and labor, on the 25th of April, many\r\nbars of iron had been forged and turned into crowbars, pincers,\r\npickaxes, mattocks, etc., which Pencroff and Neb declared to be real\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nBut in order to be in its most serviceable state, iron must be turned\r\ninto steel. Now steel, which is a combination of iron and carbon, is\r\nmade in two ways: first from cast iron, by decarburetting the molten\r\nmetal, which gives natural or puddled steel; and, second, by the method\r\nof cementation, which consists in carburetting malleable iron. As the\r\nengineer had iron in a pure state, he chose the latter method, and\r\nheated the metal with powdered charcoal in a crucible made from\r\nrefractory earth.\r\n\r\nThis steel, which was malleable hot and cold, he worked with the\r\nhammer. And Neb and Pencroff, skillfully directed, made axe-heads,\r\nwhich, heated red-hot and quickly plunged in cold water, took an\r\nexcellent temper.\r\n\r\nOther instruments, such as planes and hatchets, were rudely fashioned,\r\nand bands of steel were made into saws and chisels; and from the iron,\r\nmattocks, shovels, pickaxes, hammers, nails, etc., were manufactured.\r\n\r\nBy the 5th of May the first metallurgic period was ended, the smiths\r\nreturned to the Chimneys, and new work would soon authorize their\r\nassumption of a new title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF A DWELLING DISCUSSED AGAIN—PENCROFF’S IDEAS—AN\r\nEXPLORATION TO THE NORTH OF THE LAKE—THE WESTERN BOUNDARY OF THE\r\nPLATEAU—THE SERPENTS—THE OUTLET OF THE LAKE—TOP’S ALARM—TOP SWIMMING—A\r\nFIGHT UNDER WATER—THE DUGONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the 6th of May, corresponding to the 6th of November in the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere. For some days the sky had been cloudy, and it was\r\nimportant to make provision against winter. However, the temperature\r\nhad not lessened much, and a centigrade thermometer transported to\r\nLincoln Island would have averaged 10° or 12° above zero. This would\r\nnot be surprising, since Lincoln Island, from its probable situation in\r\nthe Southern Hemisphere, was subject to the same climatic influences as\r\nGreece or Sicily in the Northern. But just as the intense cold in\r\nGreece and Sicily sometimes produces snow and ice, so, in the height of\r\nwinter, this island would probably experience sudden changes in the\r\ntemperature against which it would be well to provide.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, if the cold was not threatening, the rainy season was at\r\nhand, and upon this desolate island, in the wide Pacific, exposed to\r\nall the inclemency of the elements, the storms would be frequent, and,\r\nprobably, terrible.\r\n\r\nThe question of a more comfortable habitation than the Chimneys ought,\r\ntherefore, to be seriously considered, and promptly acted upon.\r\n\r\nPencroff having discovered the Chimneys, naturally had a predilection\r\nfor them; but he understood very well that another place must be found.\r\nThis refuge had already been visited by the sea, and it would not do to\r\nexpose themselves to a like accident.\r\n\r\n“Moreover,” added Smith, who was discussing these things with his\r\ncompanions, “there are some precautions to take.”\r\n\r\n“Why? The island is not inhabited,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Probably not,” answered the engineer, “although we have not yet\r\nexplored the whole of it; but if there are no human beings, I believe\r\ndangerous beasts are numerous. So it will be better to provide a\r\nshelter against a possible attack, than for one of us to be tending the\r\nfire every night. And then, my friends, we must foresee everything. We\r\nare here in a part of the Pacific often frequented by Malay pirates—”\r\n\r\n“What, at this distance from land?” exclaimed Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy, these pirates are hardy sailors as well as formidable\r\nvillains, and we must provide for them accordingly.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroff, “we will fortify ourselves against two and\r\nfour-footed savages. But, sir, wouldn’t it be as well to explore the\r\nisland thoroughly before doing anything else?”\r\n\r\n“It would be better,” added Spilett; “who knows but we may find on the\r\nopposite coast one or more of those caves which we have looked for here\r\nin vain.”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” answered the engineer, “but you forget, my friends, that\r\nwe must be somewhere near running water, and that from Mount Franklin\r\nwe were unable to see either brook or river in that direction. Here, on\r\nthe contrary, we are between the Mercy and Lake Grant, which is an\r\nadvantage not to be neglected. And, moreover, as this coast faces the\r\neast, it is not as exposed to the trade winds, which blow from the\r\nnorthwest in this hemisphere.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Mr. Smith,” replied the sailor, “let us build a house on\r\nthe edge of the lake. We are no longer without bricks and tools. After\r\nhaving been brickmakers, potters, founders, and smiths, we ought to be\r\nmasons easily enough.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend; but before deciding it will be well to look about. A\r\nhabitation all ready made would save us a great deal of work, and\r\nwould, doubtless, offer a surer retreat, in which we would be safe from\r\nenemies, native as well as foreign?”\r\n\r\n“But, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “have we not already examined the\r\nwhole of this great granite wall without finding even a hole?”\r\n\r\n“No, not one!” added Pencroff. “If we could only dig a place in it high\r\nout of reach, that would be the thing! I can see it now, on the part\r\noverlooking the sea, five or six chambers—”\r\n\r\n“With windows!” said Herbert, laughing.\r\n\r\n“And a staircase!” added Neb.\r\n\r\n“Why do you laugh?” cried the sailor. “Haven’t we picks and mattocks?\r\nCannot Mr. Smith make powder to blow up the mine. You will be able,\r\nwon’t you, sir, to make powder when we want it?”\r\n\r\nThe engineer had listened to the enthusiastic sailor developing these\r\nimaginative projects. To attack this mass of granite, even by mining,\r\nwas an Herculean task, and it was truly vexing that nature had not\r\nhelped them in their necessity. But he answered Pencroff, by simply\r\nproposing to examine the wall more attentively, from the mouth of the\r\nriver to the angle which ended it to the north. They therefore went out\r\nand examined it most carefully for about two miles. But everywhere it\r\nrose, uniform and upright, without any visible cavity. The rock-pigeons\r\nflying about its summit had their nests in holes drilled in the very\r\ncrest, or upon the irregularly cut edge of the granite.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to make a sufficient excavation in such a massive wall even\r\nwith pickaxe and powder was not to be thought of. It was vexatious\r\nenough. By chance, Pencroff had discovered in the Chimneys, which must\r\nnow be abandoned, the only temporary, habitable shelter on this part of\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nWhen the survey was ended the colonists found themselves at the\r\nnorthern angle of the wall, where it sunk by long declivities to the\r\nshore. From this point to its western extremity it was nothing more\r\nthan a sort of talus composed of stones, earth, and sand bound together\r\nby plants, shrubs, and grass, in a slope of about 45°. Here and there\r\nthe granite thrust its sharp points out from the cliff. Groups of trees\r\ngrew over these slopes and there was a thin carpet of grass. But the\r\nvegetation extended but a short distance, and then the long stretch of\r\nsand, beginning at the foot of the talus, merged into the beach.\r\n\r\nSmith naturally thought that the over flow of the lake fell in this\r\ndirection, as the excess of water from Red Creek must be discharged\r\nsomewhere, and this point had not been found less on the side already\r\nexplored, that is to say from the mouth of the creek westward as far as\r\nProspect Plateau.\r\n\r\nThe engineer proposed to his companions that they clamber up the talus\r\nand return to the Chimneys by the heights, exploring the eastern and\r\nwestern shores of the lake. The proposition was accepted, and, in a few\r\nminutes, Herbert and Neb had climbed to the plateau, the others\r\nfollowing more leisurely.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred feet distant the beautiful sheet of water shone through the\r\nleaves in the sunlight. The landscape was charming. The trees in autumn\r\ntints, were harmoniously grouped. Some huge old weatherbeaten trunks\r\nstood out in sharp relief against the green turf which covered the\r\nground, and brilliant cockatoos, like moving, prisms, glanced among the\r\nbranches, uttering their shrill screams.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, instead of proceeding directly to the north bank of the\r\nlake, bore along the edge of the plateau, so as to come back to the\r\nmouth of the creek, on its left bank. It was a circuit of about a mile\r\nand a half. The walk was easy, as the trees, set wide apart, left free\r\npassage between them. They could see that the fertile zone stopped at\r\nthis point, and that the vegetation here, was less vigorous than\r\nanywhere between the creek and the Mercy.\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions moved cautiously over this unexplored\r\nneighborhood. Bows and arrows and iron-pointed sticks were their sole\r\nweapons. But no beast showed itself, and it was probable that the\r\nanimals kept to the thicker forests in the south. The colonists,\r\nhowever, experienced a disagreeable sensation in seeing Top stop before\r\na huge serpent 14 or 15 feet long. Neb killed it at a blow. Smith\r\nexamined the reptile, and pronounced it to belong to the species of\r\ndiamond-serpents eaten by the natives of New South Wales and not\r\nvenomous, but it was possible others existed whose bite was mortal,\r\nsuch as the forked-tail deaf viper, which rise up under the foot, or\r\nthe winged serpents, furnished with two ear-like appendages, which\r\nenable them to shoot forward with extreme rapidity. Top having gotten\r\nover his surprise, pursued these reptiles with reckless fierceness, and\r\nhis master was constantly obliged to call him in.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of Red Creek, where it emptied into the lake, was soon\r\nreached. The party recognized on the opposite bank the point visited on\r\ntheir descent from Mount Franklin. Smith ascertained that the supply of\r\nwater from the creek was considerable; there therefore must be an\r\noutlet for the overflow somewhere. It was this place which must be\r\nfound, as, doubtless, it made a fall which could be utilized as a\r\nmotive power.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, strolling along, without, however, straying too far from\r\neach other, began to follow round the bank of the lake, which was very\r\nabrupt. The water was full of fishes, and Pencroff promised himself\r\nsoon to manufacture some apparatus with which to capture them.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary first to double the point at the northeast. They had\r\nthought that the discharge would be here, as the water flowed close to\r\nthe edge of the plateau. But as it was not here, the colonists\r\ncontinued along the bank, which, after a slight curve, followed\r\nparallel with the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nOn this side the bank was less wooded, but clumps of trees, here and\r\nthere, made a picturesque landscape. The whole extent of the lake,\r\nunmoved by a single ripple, was visible before, them. Top, beating the\r\nbush, flushed many coveys of birds, which Spilett and Herbert saluted\r\nwith their arrows. One of these birds, cleverly hit by the lad, dropped\r\nin the rushes. Top rushing after it, brought back a beautiful\r\nslate-colored water fowl. It was a coot, as large as a big partridge,\r\nbelonging to the group of machio-dactyls, which form the division\r\nbetween the waders and the palmipedes. Poor game and bad tasting, but\r\nas Top was not as difficult to please as his masters, it was agreed\r\nthat the bird would answer for his supper.\r\n\r\nThen the colonists, following the southern bank of the lake, soon came\r\nto the place they had previously visited. The engineer was very much\r\nsurprised, as he had seen no indication of an outlet to the surplus\r\nwater. In talking with the reporter and the sailor, he did not conceal\r\nhis astonishment.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Top, who had been behaving himself quietly, showed\r\nsigns of alarm. The intelligent animal, running along the bank,\r\nsuddenly stopped, with one foot raised, and looked into the water as if\r\npointing some invisible game. Then he barked furiously, questioning it,\r\nas it were, and again was suddenly silent.\r\n\r\nAt first neither Smith nor his companions paid any attention to the\r\ndog’s actions, but his barking became so incessant, that the engineer\r\nnoticed it.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Top?” he called.\r\n\r\nThe dog bounded towards his master, and, showing a real anxiety, rushed\r\nback to the bank. Then, suddenly, he threw himself into the lake.\r\n\r\n“Come back here, Top,” cried the engineer, not wishing his dog to\r\nventure in those supicious waters.\r\n\r\n“What’s going on under there?” asked the sailor examining the surface\r\nof the lake.\r\n\r\n“Top has smelt something amphibious,” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“It must be an alligator,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” answered Smith. “Alligators are not met with in\r\nthis latitude.”\r\n\r\nMeantime, Top came ashore at the call of his master, but he could not\r\nbe quiet; he rushed along the bank, through the tall grass, and, guided\r\nby instinct, seemed to be following some object, invisible under the\r\nwater, which was hugging the shore. Nevertheless the surface was calm\r\nand undisturbed by a ripple. Often the colonists stood still on the\r\nbank and watched the water, but they could discover nothing. There\r\ncertainly was some mystery here, and the engineer was much perplexed.\r\n\r\n“We will follow out this exploration,” he said.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour all had arrived at the southeast angle of the lake, and\r\nwere again upon Prospect Plateau. They had made the circle of the bank\r\nwithout the engineer having discovered either where or how the surplus\r\nwater was discharged.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, this outlet exists,” he repeated, “and, since it is not\r\noutside, it must penetrate the massive granite of the coast!”\r\n\r\n“And why do you want to find that out?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Because,” answered the engineer, “if the outlet is through the solid\r\nrock it is possible that there is some cavity, which could be easily\r\nrendered habitable, after having turned the water in another\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\n“But may not the water flow into the sea, through a subterranean outlet\r\nat the bottom of the lake?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” answered Smith, “and in that case, since Nature has not\r\naided us, we must build our house ourselves.”\r\n\r\nAs it was 5 o’clock, the colonists were thinking of returning to the\r\nChimneys across the plateau, when Top again became excited, and,\r\nbarking with rage, before his master could hold him, he sprang a second\r\ntime into the lake. Every one ran to the bank. The dog was already\r\ntwenty feet off, and Smith called to him to come back, when suddenly an\r\nenormous head emerged from the water.\r\n\r\nHerbert instantly recognized it, the comical face, with huge eyes and\r\nlong silky moustaches.\r\n\r\n“A manatee,” he cried.\r\n\r\nAlthough not a manatee, it was a dugong, which belongs to the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe huge monster threw himself upon the dog. His master could do\r\nnothing to save him, and, before Spilett or Herbert could draw their\r\nbows, Top, seized by the dugong, had disappeared under the water.\r\n\r\nNeb, spear in hand, would have sprung to the rescue of the dog, and\r\nattacked the formidable monster in its own element, had he not been\r\nheld back by his master.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a struggle was going on under the water—a struggle which,\r\nowing to the powerlessness of the dog, was inexplicable; a struggle\r\nwhich, they could see by the agitation of the surface, was becoming\r\nmore terrible each moment; in short, a struggle which could only be\r\nterminated by the death of the dog. But suddenly, through the midst of\r\na circle of foam, Top appeared, shot upward by some unknown force,\r\nrising ten feet in the air, and falling again into the tumultuous\r\nwaters, from which he escaped to shore without any serious wounds,\r\nmiraculously saved.\r\n\r\nCyrus Smith and his companions looked on amazed. Still more\r\ninexplicable, it seemed as if the struggle under water continued.\r\nDoubtless the dugong, after having seized the dog, had been attacked by\r\nsome more formidable animal, and had been obliged to defend itself.\r\n\r\nBut this did not last much longer. The water grew red with blood, and\r\nthe body of the dugong, emerging from the waves, floated on to a little\r\nshoal at the southern angle of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe colonists ran to where the animal lay, and found it dead. Its body\r\nwas enormous, measuring between 15 and 16 feet long and weighing\r\nbetween 3,000 and 4,000 pounds. On its neck, yawned a wound, which\r\nseemed to have been made by some sharp instrument.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that had been able, by this terrible cut, to kill the\r\nformidable dugong? None of them could imagine, and, preoccupied with\r\nthese incidents, they returned to the Chimneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE LAKE—THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT—THE PROSPECTS OF CYRUS\r\nSMITH—THE DUGONG FAT—THE USE OF THE SCHISTOUS LIMESTONE—THE SULPHATE OF\r\nIRON—HOW GLYCERINE IS MADE—SOAP—SALTPETRE—SULPHURIC ACID—NITRIC\r\nACID—THE NEW OUTLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 7th of May, Smith and Spilett, leaving Neb to prepare\r\nthe breakfast, climbed the plateau, while Herbert and Pencroff went\r\nafter a fresh supply of wood.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and the reporter soon arrived, at the little beach where\r\nthe dugong lay stranded. Already flocks of birds had gathered about the\r\ncarcass, and it was necessary to drive them off with stones, as the\r\nengineer wished to preserve the fat for the use of the colony. As to\r\nthe flesh of the dugong, it would undoubtedly furnish excellent food,\r\nas in certain portions of the Malay archipelago it is reserved for the\r\ntable of the native princes. But it was Neb’s affair to look after\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nJust now, Cyrus Smith was thinking of other things. The incident of the\r\nday before was constantly presenting itself. He wanted to solve the\r\nmystery of that unseen combat, and to know what congener of the\r\nmastodons or other marine monster had given the dugong this strange\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nHe stood upon the border of the lake, looking upon its tranquil surface\r\nsparkling under the rays of the rising sun. From the little beach where\r\nthe dugong lay, the waters deepened slowly towards the centre, and the\r\nlake might be likened to a large basin, filled by the supply from Red\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\n“Well, Cyrus,” questioned the reporter, “I don’t see anything\r\nsuspicious in this?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear fellow, and I am at a loss how to explain yesterday’s\r\naffair.”\r\n\r\n“The wound on this beast is strange enough, and I can’t understand how\r\nTop could have been thrown out of the water in that way. One would\r\nsuppose that it had been done by a strong arm, and that that same arm,\r\nwielding a poignard, had given the dugong his death-wound.”\r\n\r\n“It would seem so,” answered the engineer, who had become thoughtful.\r\n“There is something here which I cannot understand. But neither can we\r\nexplain how I myself was saved; how I was snatched from the waves and\r\nborne to the downs. Therefore, I am sure there is some mystery which we\r\nwill some day discover. In the mean time, let us take care not to\r\ndiscuss these singular incidents before our companions, but keep our\r\nthoughts for each other, and continue our work.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Smith had not yet discovered what became of\r\nthe surplus water of the lake, and as there was no indication of its\r\never overflowing, an outlet must exist somewhere. He was surprised,\r\ntherefore, on noticing a slight current just at this place. Throwing in\r\nsome leaves and bits of wood, and observing their drift, he followed\r\nthis current, which brought him to the southern end of the lake. Here\r\nhe detected a slight depression in the waters, as if they were suddenly\r\nlost in some opening below.\r\n\r\nSmith listened, placing his ear to the surface of the lake, and\r\ndistinctly heard the sound of a subterranean fall.\r\n\r\n“It is there,” said he, rising, “there that the water is discharged,\r\nthere, doubtless, through a passage in the massive granite that it goes\r\nto join the sea, through cavities which we will be able to utilize to\r\nour profit! Well! I will find out!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer cut a long branch, stripped off its leaves, and, plunging\r\nit down at the angle of the two banks, he found that there was a large\r\nopen hole a foot below the surface. This was the long-sought-for\r\noutlet, and such was the force of the current that the branch was\r\nsnatched from his hands and disappeared.\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt of it now,” repeated the engineer. “It is the\r\nmouth of the outlet, and I am going to work to uncover it.\r\n\r\n“How?” inquired Spilett.\r\n\r\n“By lowering the lake three feet.”\r\n\r\n“And how will you do that?”\r\n\r\n“By opening another vent larger than this.”\r\n\r\n“Whereabouts, Cyrus?”\r\n\r\n“Where the bank is nearest the coast.”\r\n\r\n“But it is a granite wall,” exclaimed Spilett,\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied Smith. “I will blow up the wall, and the waters,\r\nescaping, will subside so as to discover the orifice—”\r\n\r\n“And will make a waterfall at the cliff,” added the reporter.\r\n\r\n“A fall that we will make use of!” answered Cyrus. “Come, come!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer hurried off his companion, whose confidence in Smith was\r\nsuch that he doubted not the success of the undertaking. And yet, this\r\nwall of granite, how would they begin: how, without powder, with but\r\nimperfect tools, could they blast the rock? Had not the engineer\r\nundertaken a work beyond his skill to accomplish?\r\n\r\nWhen Smith and the reporter re-entered the Chimneys, they found Herbert\r\nand Pencroff occupied in unloading their raft.\r\n\r\n“The wood-choppers have finished, sir,” said the sailor, laughing, “and\r\nwhen you want masons—”\r\n\r\n“Not masons, but chemists,” interrupted the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Spilett, “we are going to blow up the island.”\r\n\r\n“Blow up the island?” cried the sailor.\r\n\r\n“A part of it, at least,” answered the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, my friends,” said the engineer, who thereupon made known\r\nthe result of his observations. His theory was, that a cavity, more or\r\nless considerable, existed in the mass of granite which upheld Prospect\r\nPlateau, and he undertook to penetrate to it. To do this, it was first\r\nnecessary to free the present opening, in other words to lower the\r\nlevel of the lake by giving the water a larger issue. To do this they\r\nmust manufacture an explosive with which to make a drain in another\r\npart of the bank. It was this Smith was going to attempt to do, with\r\nthe minerals Nature had placed at his disposal.\r\n\r\nAll entered into the proposal with enthusiasm. Neb and Pencroff were at\r\nonce detailed to extract the fat from the dugong and to preserve the\r\nflesh for food; and soon after their departure the others, carrying the\r\nhurdle, went up the shore to the vein of coal, where were to be found\r\nthe schistous pyrites of which Smith had procured a specimen.\r\n\r\nThe whole day was employed in bringing a quantity of these pyrites to\r\nthe Chimneys, and by evening they had several tons.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations.\r\nThe schistous pyrites were principally composed of carbon, of silica,\r\nof alumina, and sulphuret of iron,—these were in excess,—it was\r\nnecessary to separate the sulphuret and change it into sulphate by the\r\nquickest means. The sulphate obtained, they would extract the Sulphuric\r\nacid, which was what they wanted.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is one of the agents in most general use, and the\r\nindustrial importance of a nation can be measured by its consumption.\r\nIn the future this acid would be of use to the colonists in making\r\ncandles, tanning skins, etc., but at present the engineer reserved it\r\nfor another purpose.\r\n\r\nSmith chose, behind the Chimneys, a place upon which the earth was\r\ncarefully levelled. On this he made a pile of branches and cut wood, on\r\nwhich were placed pieces of schistous pyrites leaning against each\r\nother, and then all was covered over with a thin layer of pyrites\r\npreviously reduced to the size of nuts.\r\n\r\nThis done, they set the wood on, fire, which in turn inflamed the\r\nschist, as it contained carbon and sulphur. Then new layers of pyrites\r\nwere arranged so as to form an immense heap, surrounded with earth, and\r\ngrass, with air-holes left here and there, just as is done in reducing\r\na pile of wood to charcoal.\r\n\r\nThen they left the transformation to complete itself. It would take ten\r\nor twelve days for the sulphuret of iron and the alumina to change into\r\nsulphates, which substances were equally soluble; the others—silica,\r\nburnt carbon, and cinders—were not so.\r\n\r\nWhile this chemical process was accomplishing itself, Smith employed\r\nhis companions upon other branches of the work, which they undertook\r\nwith the utmost zeal.\r\n\r\nNeb and Pencroff had taken the fat from the dugong, which had been\r\nplaced in large earthen jars. It was necessary to separate the\r\nglycerine from this fat by saponifying it. It was sufficient, in order\r\nto do this, to treat it with chalk or soda. Chalk was not wanting, but\r\nby this treatment the soap would be calcareous and useless, while by\r\nusing soda, a soluble soap, which could be employed for domestic\r\npurposes, would be the result. Cyrus Smith, being a practical man,\r\npreferred to try to get the soda. Was this difficult? No, since many\r\nkinds of marine plants abounded on the shore, and all those fucaceæ\r\nwhich form wrack. They therefore gathered a great quantity of these\r\nseaweed, which were first dried, and, afterwards, burnt in trenches in\r\nthe open air. The combustion of these plants was continued for many\r\ndays, so that the heat penetrated throughout, and the result was the\r\ngreyish compact mass, long known as “natural soda.”\r\n\r\nThis accomplished, the engineer treated the fat with the soda, which\r\ngave both a soluble soap and the neutral substance, glycerine.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Smith wanted, in view of his future operations,\r\nanother substance, nitrate of potash, better known as saltpetre.\r\n\r\nHe could make this by treating carbonate of potash, which is easily\r\nextracted from vegetable ashes, with nitric acid. But this acid, which\r\nwas precisely what he wanted in order to complete his undertaking\r\nsuccessfully, he did not have. Fortunately, in this emergency, Nature\r\nfurnished him with saltpetre, without any labor other than picking it\r\nup. Herbert had found a vein of this mineral at the foot of Mount\r\nFranklin, and all they had to do was to purify the salt.\r\n\r\nThese different undertakings, which occupied eight days, were finished\r\nbefore the sulphate of iron was ready. During the interval the\r\ncolonists made some refractory pottery in plastic clay, and constructed\r\na brick furnace of a peculiar shape, in which to distil the sulphate of\r\niron. All was finished on the 18th of May, the very day the chemical\r\nwork was completed.\r\n\r\nThe result of this latter operation, consisting of sulphate of iron,\r\nsulphate of alumina, silica, and a residue of charcoal and cinders, was\r\nplaced, in a basin full of water. Having stirred up the mixture, they\r\nlet it settle, and at length poured off a clear liquid holding the\r\nsulphates of iron and alumina in solution. Finally, this liquid was\r\npartly evaporated, the sulphate of iron crystalized, and the\r\nmother-water was thrown away.\r\n\r\nSmith had now a quantity of crystals, from which the sulphuric acid was\r\nto be extracted.\r\n\r\nIn commerce this acid is manufactured in large quantities and by\r\nelaborate processes. The engineer had no such means at his command, but\r\nhe knew that in Bohemia an acid known as Nordhausen is made by simpler\r\nmeans, which has, moreover, the advantage of being non-concentrated.\r\nFor obtaining the acid in this way, all the engineer had to do was to\r\ncalcinize the crystals in a closed jar in such a manner that the\r\nsulphuric acid distilled in vapor, which would in turn produce the acid\r\nby condensation.\r\n\r\nIt was for this that the refractory jars and the furnace had been made.\r\nThe operation was a success; and on the 20th of May, twelve days after\r\nhaving begun, Smith was the possessor of the agent which he expected to\r\nuse later in different ways.\r\n\r\nWhat did he want with it now? Simply to produce nitric acid, which was\r\nperfectly easy, since the saltpetre, attacked by the sulphuric acid,\r\nwould give it by distillation.\r\n\r\nBut how would he use this acid? None of the others knew, as he had\r\nspoken no word on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe work approached completion, and one more operation would procure\r\nthe substance which had required all this labor. The engineer mixed the\r\nnitric acid with the glycerine, which latter had been previously\r\nconcentrated by evaporation in a water-bath, and without employing any\r\nfreezing mixture, obtained many pints of an oily yellow liquid.\r\n\r\nThis last operation Smith had conducted alone, at some distance from\r\nthe Chimneys, as he feared an explosion, and when he returned, with a\r\nflagon of this liquid, to his friends, he simply said:—“Here is some\r\nnitro-glycerine!”\r\n\r\nIt was, in truth, that terrible product, whose explosive power is,\r\nperhaps, ten times as great as that of gunpowder, and which has caused\r\nso many accidents! Although, since means have been found of\r\ntransforming it into dynamite, that is, of mixing it with clay or sugar\r\nor some solid substance sufficiently porous to hold it, the dangerous\r\nliquid can be used with more safety. But dynamite was not known when\r\nthe colonists were at work on Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n“And is that stuff going to blow up the rocks?” asked Pencroff,\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend,” answered the engineer, “and it will do all the better\r\nsince the granite is very hard and will oppose more resistance to the\r\nexplosion.”\r\n\r\n“And when will we see all this, sir?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” when we have drilled a hole,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, the 21st of May, the miners betook themselves\r\nto a point which formed the east bank of Lake Grant, not more than 500\r\nfeet from the coast. At this place the plateau was lower than the lake,\r\nwhich was upheld by the coping of granite. It was plain that could they\r\nbreak this the waters would escape by this vent, and, forming a stream,\r\nflow over the inclined surface of the plateau, and be precipitated in a\r\nwaterfall over the cliff on to the shore. Consequently, there would be\r\na general lowering of the lake, and the orifice of the water would be\r\nuncovered—this was to be the result.\r\n\r\nThe coping must be broken. Pencroff, directed by the engineer, attacked\r\nits outer facing vigorously. The hole which he made with his pick began\r\nunder a horizontal edge of the bank, and penetrated obliquely so as to\r\nreach a level lower than the lake’s surface. Thus the blowing up of the\r\nrocks would permit the water to escape freely and consequently lower\r\nthe lake sufficiently.\r\n\r\nThe work was tedious, as the engineer, wishing to produce a violent\r\nshock, had determined to use not less than two gallons of\r\nnitro-glycerine in the operation. But Pencroff and Neb, taking turns at\r\nthe work, did so well, that by 4 o’clock in the afternoon it was\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nNow came the question of igniting the explosive. Ordinarily,\r\nnitro-glycerine is ignited by the explosion of fulminated caps, as, if\r\nlighted without percussion, this substance burns and does not explode.\r\n\r\nSmith could doubtless make a cap. Lacking fulminate, he could easily\r\nobtain a substance analogous to gun-cotton, since he had nitric acid at\r\nhand. This substance pressed in a cartridge, and introduced into the\r\nnitro-glycerine, could be lighted with a slow match, and produce the\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nBut Smith knew that their liquid had the property of exploding under a\r\nblow. He determined, therefore, to make use of this property, reserving\r\nthe other means in case this experiment failed.\r\n\r\nThe blow of a hammer upon some drops of the substance spread on a hard\r\nstone, suffices to provoke an explosion. But no one could give those\r\nblows without being a victim to the operation. Smith’s idea was to\r\nsuspend a heavy mass of iron by means of a vegetable fibre to an\r\nupright post, so as to have the iron hang directly over the hole.\r\nAnother long fibre, previously soaked in sulphur, was to be fastened to\r\nthe middle of the first and laid along the ground many feet from this\r\nexcavation. The fire was to be applied to this second fibre, it would\r\nburn till it reached the first and set it on fire, then the latter\r\nwould break and the iron be precipitated upon the nitro-glycerine.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus was fixed in place; then the engineer, after having made\r\nhis companions go away, filled the hole so that the fluid overflowed\r\nthe opening, and spread some drops underneath the mass of suspended\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThis done, Smith lit the end of the sulfured fibre, and, leaving the\r\nplace, returned with his companions to the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five minutes after a tremendous explosion was heard. It seemed\r\nas if the whole island trembled to its base. A volley of stones rose\r\ninto the air as if they had been vomited from a volcano. The concussion\r\nwas such that it shook the Chimneys. The colonists, though two miles\r\naway, were thrown to the ground. Rising again, they clambered up to the\r\nplateau and hurried towards the place.\r\n\r\nA large opening had been torn in the granite coping. A rapid stream of\r\nwater escaped through it, leaping and foaming across the plateau, and,\r\nreaching the brink, fell a distance of 300 feet to the shore below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENCROFF DOUBTS NO MORE—THE OLD OUTLET OF THE LAKE—A SUBTERRANEAN\r\nDESCENT—THE WAY THROUGH THE GRANITE—TOP HAS DISAPPEARED—THE CENTRAL\r\nCAVERN—THE LOWER WELL—MYSTERY—THE BLOWS WITH THE PICK—THE RETURN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith’s project had succeeded; but, as was his manner, he stood\r\nmotionless, absorbed, his lips closed, giving no sign of satisfaction.\r\nHerbert was all enthusiasm; Neb jumped with joy; Pencroff, shaking his\r\nhead, murmured:—\r\n\r\n“Indeed, our engineer does wonders!”\r\n\r\nThe nitro-glycerine had worked powerfully. The opening was so great\r\nthat at least a three times greater volume of water escaped by it than\r\nby the former outlet. In a little while, therefore, the level of the\r\nlake would be lowered two feet or more.\r\n\r\nThe colonists returned to the Chimneys, and collecting some picks,\r\nspears, ropes, a steel and tinder, returned to the plateau. Top went\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nOn the way the sailor could not resist saying to the engineer:—\r\n\r\n“But do you really think, Mr. Smith, that one could blow up the whole\r\nisland with this beautiful liquid of yours?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” replied the other, “island, continents, the world itself.\r\nIt is only a question of quantity.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t you use this nitro-glycerine to load firearms.”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff, because it is too shattering. But it would be easy to\r\nmake gun-cotton, or even common powder, as we have the material.\r\nUnfortunately, the guns themselves are wanting.”\r\n\r\n“But with a little ingenuity!—”\r\n\r\nPencroff had erased “impossible” from his vocabulary.\r\n\r\nThe colonists having reached Prospect Plateau, hastened at once to the\r\nold outlet of the lake, which ought now to be uncovered. And when the\r\nwater no longer poured through it, it would, doubtless, be easy to\r\nexplore its interior arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they reached the lower angle of the lake, and saw at a\r\nglance what the result was.\r\n\r\nThere, in the granite wall of the lake, above the water-level, appeared\r\nthe long-looked for opening. A narrow ledge, left bare, by the\r\nsubsidence of the water, gave them access to it. The opening was twenty\r\nfeet wide, though only two feet high. It was like the gutter-mouth in a\r\npavement. It was not open enough for the party to get in, but Neb and\r\nPencroff, with their picks, in less than an hour had given it a\r\nsufficient height.\r\n\r\nThe engineer looked in and saw that the walls of the opening in its\r\nupper part showed a slope of from 30° to 35°. And, therefore, unless\r\nthey became much steeper it would be easy to descend, perhaps, to the\r\nlevel of the sea. And if, as was probable, some vast cavern existed in\r\nthe interior of the massive granite, it was possible that they could\r\nmake use of it.\r\n\r\n“What are we waiting for, Mr. Smith,” cried the sailor, all impatience\r\nto begin the exploration, “Top, you see, has gone ahead!”\r\n\r\n“We must have some light,” said the engineer. “Go, Neb, and cut some\r\nresinous branches.”\r\n\r\nThe negro and Herbert ran to some pine and evergreens growing upon the\r\nbank, and soon returned with branches which were made into torches.\r\nHaving lit them, the colonists, with Smith leading, entered the dark\r\npassage, but recently filled with water.\r\n\r\nContrary to their expectation, the passage grew higher as they\r\nadvanced, until soon they were able to walk upright. The granite walls,\r\nworn, by the water, were very slippery, and the party had to look out\r\nfor falls. They, therefore, fastened themselves together with a cord,\r\nlike mountain climbers. Fortunately, some granite steps made the\r\ndescent less perilous. Drops of water, still clinging to the rocks,\r\nglistened like stalactites in the torchlight. The engineer looked\r\ncarefully at this black granite. He could not see a stratum or a flaw.\r\nThe mass was compact and of fine grain, and the passage must have been\r\ncoeval with the island. It had not been worn little by little by the\r\nconstant action of water. Pluto, and not Neptune, had shaped it; and\r\nthe traces of igneous action were still visible upon its surface.\r\n\r\nThe colonists descended but slowly. They experienced some emotion in\r\nthus adventuring into the depths of the earth, in being its first human\r\nvisitants. No one spoke, but each was busied with his own reflections\r\nand the thought occurred to more than one, that perhaps some pulp or\r\nother gigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities which\r\ncommunicated with the sea. It was, therefore, necessary to advance\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\nTop was ahead of the little troop and they could rely on the dog’s\r\nsagacity to give the alarm on occasion. After having descended 100\r\nfeet, Smith halted, and the others came up with him. They were standing\r\nin a cavern of moderate size. Drops of water fell from the roof, but\r\nthey did not ooze through the rocks, they were simply the last traces\r\nof the torrent which had so long roared through this place, and the\r\nair, though humid, emitted no mephitic vapor.\r\n\r\n“Well, Cyrus,” said Spilett, “here is a retreat sufficiently unknown\r\nand hidden in the depths, but it is uninhabitable.”\r\n\r\n“How, uninhabitable?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Why, it is too small and too dark.”\r\n\r\n“Cannot we make it bigger, blast it out, and make openings for the\r\nlight and air?” answered Pencroff, who now thought nothing\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\n“Let us push on,” said Smith. “Perhaps lower down, nature will have\r\nspared us this work.”\r\n\r\n“We are only a third of the way down,” observed Herbert.\r\n\r\n“But 100 feet,” responded Cyrus; “and it is possible that 100 feet\r\nlower—.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Top?” asked Neb, interrupting his master.\r\n\r\nThey looked about the cavern. The dog was not there.\r\n\r\n“Let us overtake him,” said Smith, resuming the march. The engineer\r\nnoted carefully all the deviations of the route, and easily kept a\r\ngeneral idea of their direction, which was towards the sea. The party\r\nhad not descended more than fifty feet further, when their attention\r\nwas arrested by distant sounds coming from the depths of the rock. They\r\nstopped and listened. These sounds, borne along the passage, as the\r\nvoice through an acoustic tube, were distinctly heard.\r\n\r\n“Its Top’s barking!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and the brave dog is barking furiously,” added Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“We have our spears,” said Smith. “Come on, and be ready.”\r\n\r\n“It is becoming more and more interesting,” whispered Spilett to the\r\nsailor, who nodded assent.\r\n\r\nThey hurried to the rescue of the dog. His barks grew more distinct.\r\nThey could hear that he was in a strange rage. Had he been captured by\r\nsome animal whom he had disturbed? Without thinking of the danger, the\r\ncolonists felt themselves drawn on by an irresistible curiosity, and\r\nslipped rather than ran down the passage. Sixteen feet lower they came\r\nup with the dog.\r\n\r\nThere, the corridor opened out into a vast and magnificent cavern. Top,\r\nrushing about, was barking furiously. Pencroff and Neb, shaking their\r\ntorches, lit up all the inequalities of the granite, and the others,\r\nwith their spears ready, held themselves prepared for any emergency.\r\n\r\nBut the enormous cavern was empty. The colonists searched everywhere;\r\nthey could find no living thing. Nevertheless, Top continued barking,\r\nand neither threats nor caresses could stop him.\r\n\r\n“There must be some place where the water escaped to the sea,” said the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and look out for a hole,” answered Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“On, Top, on,” cried Smith, and the dog, encouraged by his master, ran\r\ntowards the end of the cavern, and redoubled his barking.\r\n\r\nFollowing him, they saw by the light of the torches the opening of what\r\nlooked like a well in the granite. Here, undoubtedly, was the place\r\nwhere the water had found its way out of the cavern, but this time,\r\ninstead of being a corridor sloping and accessible, it was a\r\nperpendicular well, impossible to descend.\r\n\r\nThe torches were waved above the opening. They saw nothing. Smith broke\r\noff a burning branch and dropped it into the abyss. The resin, fanned\r\nby the wind of its fall, burned brightly and illuminated the interior\r\nof the pit, but showed nothing else. Then the flame was extinguished\r\nwith a slight hiss, which indicated that it had reached the water,\r\nwhich must be the sea level.\r\n\r\nThe engineer calculated, from the time taken in the fall, that the\r\ndepth was about ninety feet. The floor of the cavern was therefore that\r\ndistance above the sea.\r\n\r\n“Here is our house,” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“But it was preoccupied,” said Spilett, whose curiosity was\r\nunsatisfied.\r\n\r\n“Well, the thing that had it, whether amphibious or not, has fled by\r\nthis outlet and vacated in our favor,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Any how, I should like to have been Top a quarter of an hour ago,”\r\nsaid the sailor, “for he does not bark at nothing.”\r\n\r\nSmith looked at his dog, and those who were near him heard him murmur:—\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am convinced that Top knows more than we do about many things!”\r\n\r\nHowever, the wishes of the colonists had been in a great measure\r\nrealized. Chance, aided by the marvelous acuteness of their chief, had\r\ndone them good service. Here they had at their disposal a vast cavern,\r\nwhose extent could not be estimated In the insufficient light of the\r\ntorches, but which could certainly be easily partitioned off with\r\nbricks into chambers, and arranged, if not as a house, at least as a\r\nspacious suite of rooms. The water having left it, could not return.\r\nThe place was free.\r\n\r\nBut two difficulties remained, the possibility of lighting the cavern\r\nand the necessity of rendering it easier of access. The first could not\r\nbe done from above as the enormous mass of granite was over them; but,\r\nperhaps, they would be able to pierce the outer wall which faced the\r\nsea. Smith, who during the descent had kept account of the slope, and\r\ntherefore of the length of the passage, believed that this part of the\r\nwall could not be very thick. If light could be thus obtained, so could\r\nentrance, as it was as easy to pierce a door as windows, and to fix a\r\nladder on the outside.\r\n\r\nSmith communicated his ideas to his companions.\r\n\r\n“Then let us set to work!” answered Pencroff; “I have my pick and will\r\nI soon make daylight in the granite! Where shall I begin?”\r\n\r\n“Here,” answered the engineer, showing the strong sailor a considerable\r\nhollow in the wall, which greatly diminished its thickness.\r\n\r\nPencroff attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of\r\nthe torches, made the splinters fly about him. Then Neb took his place,\r\nand Spilett after Neb. The work continued, two hours longer, and, when\r\nit seemed as if the wall could not be thicker than the length of the\r\npick, at the last stroke of Spilett the implement, passing through,\r\nfell on the outside.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah forever!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\nThe wall was but three feet thick.\r\n\r\nSmith looked through the opening, which was eighty feet above the\r\nground. Before him extended the coast, the islet, and, beyond, the\r\nboundless sea.\r\n\r\nThrough the hole the light entered in floods, inundating the splendid\r\ncavern and producing a magical effect. While on the left hand it\r\nmeasured only thirty feet in height and one hundred in length, to the\r\nright it was enormous, and its vault rose to a height of more than\r\neighty feet. In some places, granite pillars, irregularly disposed,\r\nsupported the arches as in the nave of a cathedral. Resting upon a sort\r\nof lateral piers, here, sinking into elliptic arches, there, rising in\r\nogive mouldings, losing itself in the dark bays, half seen in the\r\nshadow through the fantastic arches, ornamented by a profusion of\r\nprojections which seemed like pendants, this vaulted roof afforded a\r\npicturesque blending of all the architectures—Byzantine, Roman,\r\nGothic—that the hand of man has produced. And this was the work of\r\nnature! She alone had constructed this magic Alhambra in a granite\r\nrock!\r\n\r\nThe colonists were overcome with admiration. Expecting to find but a\r\nnarrow cavern, they found themselves in a sort of marvellous palace,\r\nand Neb had taken off his hat as if he had been transported into a\r\ntemple!\r\n\r\nExclamations of pleasure escaped from their lips, and the hurrahs\r\nechoed and reechoed from the depths of the dark nave.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” cried Smith, “when we shall have lighted the interior of\r\nthis place, when we shall have arranged our chambers, our store-rooms,\r\nour offices in the left-hand portion, we will still have this splendid\r\ncavern, which shall be our study and our museum!\r\n\r\n“And we will call it—” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Granite House,” answered Smith; and his companions saluted the name\r\nwith their cheers.\r\n\r\nBy this time the torches were nearly consumed, and as, in order to\r\nreturn, it was necessary to regain the summit of the plateau and to\r\nremount the corridor, it was decided to postpone until the morrow the\r\nwork of arranging their new home.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, Smith leaned over the dark pit once more and listened\r\nattentively. But there was no sound from these depths save that of the\r\nwater agitated by the undulations of the surge. A resinous torch was\r\nagain thrown in, lighting up anew for an instant the walls of the well,\r\nbut nothing suspicions was revealed. If any marine monster had been\r\ninopportunely surprised by the retreat of the waters, he had already\r\nregained the open sea by the subterranean passage which extended under\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the engineer stood motionless, listening attentively, his\r\ngaze plunged in the abyss, without speaking.\r\n\r\nThen the sailor approached him, and, touching his arm:—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What is it, my friend,” responded the engineer, like one returning\r\nfrom the land of dreams.\r\n\r\n“The torches are nearly out.”\r\n\r\n“Forward!” said Smith; and the little troop left the cavern and began\r\nthe ascent through the dark weir. Top walked behind, still growling in\r\nan odd way. The ascension was sufficiently laborious, and the colonists\r\nstopped for a few minutes at the upper grotto, which formed a sort of\r\nlanding half way up the long granite stairway. Then they began again to\r\nmount, and pretty soon they felt the fresh air. The drops, already\r\nevaporated, no longer shone on the walls. The light of the torches\r\ndiminished; Neb’s went out, and they had to hasten in order to avoid\r\nhaving to grope their way through, the profound darkness. A little\r\nbefore 4 o’clock, just as the torch of the sailor was burnt out, Smith\r\nand his companions emerged from the mouth of the passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH’S PLAN—THE FRONT OF GRANITE HOUSE—THE ROPE LADDER—PENCROFF’S\r\nIDEAS—THE AROMATIC HERBS—A NATURAL WARREN—GETTING WATER—THE VIEW FROM\r\nTHE WINDOWS OF GRANITE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next day, May 22, the colonists proceeded to take possession of\r\ntheir new abode. They longed to exchange their insufficient shelter for\r\nthe vast retreat in the rock, impenetrable to wind and wave. Still they\r\ndid not intend altogether to abandon the Chimneys, but to make a\r\nworkshop of it.\r\n\r\nSmith’s first care was to ascertain exactly over what point rose the\r\nface of Granite House. He went down on the shore to the foot of the\r\nimmense wall, and, as the pickaxe, which slipped from the reporter’s\r\nhands, must have fallen perpendicularly, he could ascertain, by finding\r\nthis pickaxe, the place where the granite had been pierced. And, in\r\nfact, when the implement was found, half buried in the sand, the hole\r\nin the rock could be seen eighty feet above it, in a straight line.\r\nRock pigeons were already fluttering in and out by this narrow opening.\r\nThey evidently thought Granite House had been discovered for their\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThe engineer intended to divide the right portion of the cavern into\r\nseveral chambers opening upon an entrance-corridor, and lighted by five\r\nwindows and a door cut in the face of the rock. Pencroff agreed with\r\nhim as to the window, but could not understand the use of the door,\r\nsince the old weir furnished a natural staircase to Granite House.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Smith, “if we could get to our abode by the weir, so\r\ncan others. I want to block up this passage at its month, to seal it\r\nhermetically, and even, if necessary, to conceal the entrance by\r\ndamming up the lake.”\r\n\r\n“And how shall we get in?” said the sailor.\r\n\r\n“By a rope ladder from the outside,” answered Smith, “which we can pull\r\nup after us.”\r\n\r\n“But why take so many precautions?” said Pencroff. “So far, the animals\r\nwe have found here have not been formidable; and there are certainly no\r\nnatives.”\r\n\r\n“Are you so sure, Pencroff?” said the engineer, looking steadily at the\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n“Of course we shall not be perfectly sure till we have explored every\r\npart.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Smith, “for we know as yet only a small portion. But even\r\nif there are no enemies upon the island, they may come from the\r\noutside, for this part of the Pacific is a dangerous region. We must\r\ntake every precaution.”\r\n\r\nSo the facade of Granite House was lighted with five windows, and with\r\na door opening upon the “apartments,” and admitting plenty of light\r\ninto that wonderful nave which was to serve as their principal\r\nhallroom. This facade, eighty feet above the ground, was turned to the\r\neast, and caught the first rays of the morning sun. It was protected by\r\nthe slope of the rock from the piercing northeast wind. In the\r\nmeantime, while the sashes of the windows were being made, the engineer\r\nmeant to close the openings with thick shutters, which would keep out\r\nwind and rain, and which could be readily concealed. The first work was\r\nto hollow out these windows. But the pickaxe was at a disadvantage\r\namong these hard rocks, and Smith again had recourse to the\r\nnitro-glycerine, which, used in small quantities, had the desired\r\neffect. Then the work was finished by the pick and mattock—the five\r\nogive windows, the bay, the bull’s-eyes, and the door—and, some days\r\nafter the work was begun, the sun shone in upon the innermost recesses\r\nof Granite House.\r\n\r\nAccording to Smith’s plan, the space had been divided into five\r\ncompartments looking out upon the sea; upon the right was the hall,\r\nopposite to the door from which the ladder was to hang, then a kitchen\r\nthirty feet long, a dining-room forty feet long, a sleeping-room of the\r\nsame size, and last a “guest chamber,” claimed by Pencroff; and\r\nbordering on the great hall.\r\n\r\nThese rooms, or rather this suite of rooms, in which they were to live,\r\ndid not occupy the full depth of the cave. They opened upon a corridor\r\nwhich ran between them and a long storehouse, where were kept their\r\nutensils and provisions. All the products of the island, animal and\r\nvegetable, could be kept there in good condition and free from damp.\r\nThey had room enough, and there was a place for everything. Moreover,\r\nthe colonists still had at their disposal the little grotto above the\r\nlarge cavern, which would serve them as a sort of attic. This plan\r\nagreed upon, they became brickmakers again, and brought their bricks to\r\nthe foot of Granite House.\r\n\r\nUntil that time the colonists had had access to the cavern only by the\r\nold weir. This mode of communication compelled them first to climb up\r\nProspect Plateau, going round by the river, to descend 200 feet through\r\nthe passage, and then to ascend the same distance when they wanted to\r\nregain the plateau. This involved fatigue and loss of time. Smith\r\nresolved to begin at once the construction of a strong rope ladder,\r\nwhich, once drawn up after them, would render the entrance to Granite\r\nHouse absolutely inaccessible. This ladder was made with the greatest\r\ncare, and its sides were twisted of fibres by means of a shuttle. Thus\r\nconstructed, it had the strength of a cable. The rungs were made of a\r\nkind of red cedar, with light and durable branches; and the whole was\r\nput together by the practised hand of Pencroff.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of tackle was made of vegetable fibre, and a sort of\r\nderrick was setup at the door of Granite House. In this way the bricks\r\ncould easily be carried to the level of Granite House; and when some\r\nthousands of them were on the spot, with abundance of lime, they began\r\nwork on the interior. They easily set up the wood partitions, and in a\r\nshort time the space was divided into chambers and a store-house,\r\naccording to the plan agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThese labors went on quickly under the direction of the engineer, who\r\nhimself wielded hammer and trowel. They worked confidently and gaily.\r\nPencroff, whether carpenter, ropemaker, or mason, always had a joke\r\nready, and all shared in his good humor. His confidence in the engineer\r\nwas absolute. All their wants would be supplied in Smith’s own time. He\r\ndreamed of canals, of quarries, of mines, of machinery, even of\r\nrailroads, one day, to cover the island. The engineer let Pencroff\r\ntalk. He knew how contagious is confidence; he smiled to hear him, and\r\nsaid nothing of his own inquietude. But in his heart he feared that no\r\nhelp could come from the outside. In that part of the Pacific, out of\r\nthe track of ships, and at such a distance from other land that no boat\r\ncould dare put out to sea, they had only themselves to rely upon.\r\n\r\nBut, as the sailor said, they were far ahead of the Swiss Family\r\nRobinson, for whom miracles were always being wrought. In truth they\r\nknew Nature; and he who knows Nature will succeed when others would lie\r\ndown to die.\r\n\r\nHerbert especially distinguished himself in the work. He understood at\r\na word and was prompt in execution. Smith grew fonder of him every day\r\nand Herbert was devoted to the engineer. Pencroff saw the growing\r\nfriendship, but the honest sailor was not jealous. Neb was courage,\r\nzeal, and self-denial in person. He relied on his master as absolutely\r\nas Pencroff, but his enthusiasm was not so noisy. The sailor and he\r\nwere great friends. As to Spilett, his skill and efficiency were a\r\ndaily wonder to Pencroff. He was the model of a newspaper man—quick\r\nalike to understand and to perform.\r\n\r\nThe ladder was put in place May 28. It was eighty feet high, and\r\nconsisted of 100 rungs; and, profiting by a projection in the face of\r\nthe cliff, about forty feet up, Smith had divided it into two parts.\r\nThis projection served as a sort of landing-place for the head of the\r\nlower ladder, shortening it, and thus lessening its swing. They\r\nfastened it with a cord so that it could easily be raised to the level\r\nof Granite House. The upper ladder they fastened at top and bottom. In\r\nthis way the ascent was much more easy. Besides, Smith counted upon\r\nputting up at some future time a hydraulic elevator, which would save\r\nhis companions much fatigue and loss of time.\r\n\r\nThe colonists rapidly accustomed themselves to the use of this ladder.\r\nThe sailor, who was used to shrouds and ratlines, was their teacher.\r\nThe great trouble was with Top, whose four feet were not intended for\r\nladders. But Pencroff was persevering, and Top at last learned to run\r\nup and down as nimbly as his brothers of the circus. We cannot say\r\nwhether the sailor was proud of this pupil, but he sometimes carried\r\nTop up on his back, and Top made no complaints.\r\n\r\nAll this time, the question of provisions was not neglected. Every day\r\nHerbert and the reporter spent some hours in the chase. They hunted\r\nonly through Jacamar Woods, on the left of the river, for, in the\r\nabsence of boat or bridge, they had not yet crossed the Mercy. The\r\nimmense woody tracts which they had named the Forests of the Far West\r\nwere entirely unexplored. This important excursion was set apart for\r\nthe first five days of the coming spring. But Jacamar Woods were not\r\nwanting in game; kangaroos and boars were plenty there, and the\r\niron-tipped spears, the bows and arrows of the hunters did wonders.\r\nMore than this, Herbert discovered, at the southwest corner of, the\r\nlagoon, a natural warren, a sort of moist meadow covered with willows\r\nand aromatic herbs, which perfumed the air, such as thyme, basil, and\r\nall sorts of mint, of which rabbits are so fond. The reporter said that\r\nwhen the feast was spread for them it would be strange if the rabbits\r\ndid not come; and the hunters explored the warren carefully. At all\r\nevents, it produced an abundance of useful plants, and would give a\r\nnaturalist plenty of work. Herbert gathered a quantity of plants\r\npossessing different medicinal properties, pectoral, astringent,\r\nfebrifuge, anti-rheumatic. When Pencroff asked of what good were all\r\nthis collection of herbs:—\r\n\r\n“To cure us when we are sick,” answered the boy.\r\n\r\n“Why should we be sick, since there are no doctors on the island?” said\r\nPencroff, quite seriously.\r\n\r\nTo this no reply could be made, but the lad went on gathering his\r\nbundle, which was warmly welcomed at Granite House; especially as he\r\nhad found some Mountain Mint, known in North America as “Oswego Tea,”\r\nwhich produces a pleasant beverage.\r\n\r\nThat day the hunters, in their search, reached the site of the warren.\r\nThe ground was perforated with little holes like a colander.\r\n\r\n“Burrows!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“But are they inhabited?”\r\n\r\n“That is the question.”\r\n\r\nA question which was quickly resolved. Almost immediately, hundreds of\r\nlittle animals, like rabbits, took to flight in every direction, with\r\nsuch rapidity that Top himself was distanced. But the reporter was\r\ndetermined not to quit the place till he had captured half a dozen of\r\nthe little beasts. He wanted them now for the kitchen: domestication\r\nwould come later. With a few snares laid at the mouth of the burrows,\r\nthe affair would be easy; but there were no snares, nor materials for\r\nsnares; so they patiently rummaged every form with their sticks, until\r\nfour rodents were taken.\r\n\r\nThey were rabbits, much like their European congeners, and commonly\r\nknown as “American hares.” They were brought back to Granite Home, and\r\nfigured in that evening’s meal. Delicious eating they were; and the\r\nwarren bade fair to be a most valuable reserve for the colonists.\r\n\r\nOn May 31, the partitions were finished, and nothing remained but to\r\nfurnish the rooms, which would occupy the long days of winter. A\r\nchimney was built in the room which served as a kitchen. The\r\nconstruction of the stove-pipe gave them a good deal of trouble. The\r\nsimplest material was clay; and as they did not wish to have any outlet\r\non the upper plateau, they pierced a hole above the kitchen window, and\r\nconducted the pipe obliquely to this hole. No doubt during an eastern\r\ngale the pipe would smoke, but the wind rarely blew from that quarter,\r\nand head-cook Neb was not particular\r\n\r\nWhen these domestic arrangements had been made, the engineer proceeded\r\nto block up the mouth of the old weir by the lake, so as to prevent any\r\napproach from that quarter. Great square blocks were rolled to the\r\nopening, and strongly cemented together. Smith did not yet attempt to\r\nput in execution his project of damming up the waters of the lake so as\r\nto conceal this weir; he was satisfied with concealing the obstruction\r\nhe had placed there by means of grass, shrubs, and thistles, which were\r\nplanted in the interstices of the rocks, and which by the next spring\r\nwould sprout up luxuriantly. Meanwhile he utilized the weir in\r\nconducting to their new abode a little stream of fresh water from the\r\nlake. A little drain, constructed just below its level, had the effect\r\nof supplying them with twenty-five or thirty gallons a day; so there\r\nwas likely to be no want of water at Granite House.\r\n\r\nAt last, all was finished, just in time for the tempestuous season.\r\nThey closed the windows with thick shutters till Smith should have time\r\nto make glass from the sand. In the rocky projections around the\r\nwindows Spilett had arranged, very artistically, plants of various\r\nkinds and long floating grasses, and thus the windows were framed\r\npicturesquely in green. The denizens of this safe and solid dwelling\r\ncould but be delighted with their work. The windows opened upon a\r\nlimitless horizon, shut in only by the two Mandible Capes on the north\r\nand by Claw Cape at the south. Union Bay spread magnificently before\r\nthem. They had reason enough to be satisfied, and Pencroff did not\r\nspare his praises of what he called “his suite on the fifth floor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAINY SEASON—WHAT TO WEAR-A SEAL-HUNT—CANDLE-MAKING—-WORK IN THE\r\nGRANITE HOUSE—THE TWO CAUSEWAYS—RETURN FROM A VISIT TO THE\r\nOYSTER-BED—WHAT HERBERT FOUND IS HIS POCKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter season began in earnest with the month of June, which\r\ncorresponded with December in our northern hemisphere. Showers and\r\nstorms succeeded each other without an intermission, and the inmates of\r\nthe Granite House could appreciate the advantages of a dwelling\r\nimpervious to the weather. The Chimneys would indeed have proved a\r\nmiserable shelter against the inclemency of the winter; they feared\r\neven lest the high tides driven by the sea-wind should pour in and\r\ndestroy their furnaces and their foundry. All this month of June was\r\noccupied with various labors, which left plenty of time for hunting and\r\nfishing, so that the reserve stock of food was constantly kept up.\r\nPencroff intended, as soon as he had time, to set traps, from which he\r\nexpected great results. He had made snares of ligneous fibre, and not a\r\nday passed but some rodent was captured from the warren. Neb spent all\r\nhis time in smoking and salting meat.\r\n\r\nThe question of clothes now came up for serious discussion. The\r\ncolonists had no other garments than those which they wore when the\r\nballoon cast them on shore. These, fortunately, were warm and\r\nsubstantial; and by dint of extreme care, even their linen had been\r\nkept clean and whole; but everything would soon wear out, and moreover,\r\nduring a vigorous winter, they would suffer severely from cold. Here\r\nSmith was fairly baffled. He had been occupied in providing for their\r\nmost urgent wants, food and shelter, and the winter was upon them\r\nbefore the clothes problem could be solved. They must resign themselves\r\nto bear the cold with fortitude, and when the dry season returned would\r\nundertake a great hunt of the moufflons, which they had seen on Mount\r\nFranklin, and whose wool the engineer could surely make into warm thick\r\ncloth. He would think over the method.\r\n\r\n“Well, we must toast ourselves before the fire!” said Pencroff.”\r\nThere’s plenty of fire wood, no reason for sparing it.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” added Spilett, “Lincoln Island is not in very high latitude,\r\nand the winters are probably mild. Did you not say, Cyrus that the\r\nthirty-fifth parallel corresponded with that of Spain in the other\r\nhemisphere?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the engineer, “but the winter in Spain is sometimes very\r\ncold, with snow and ice, and we may have a hard time of it. Still we\r\nare on an island, and have a good chance for more moderate weather.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Smith?” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Because the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense reservoir, in\r\nwhich the summer heat lies stored. At the coming of winter this heat is\r\nagain given out, so that the neighboring regions have always a medium\r\ntemperature, cooler in summer and warmer in winter.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see,” said Pencroff. “I am not going to bother myself about\r\nthe weather. One thing is certain, the days are getting short already\r\nand the evenings long. Suppose we talk a little about candles.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is easier,” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“To talk about?” asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n“To make.”\r\n\r\n“And when shall we begin?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, by a seal-hunt.”\r\n\r\n“What! to make dips?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, Pencroff, candles.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the engineer’s project, which was feasible enough, as he had\r\nlime and sulphuric acid, and as the amphibia of the island would\r\nfurnish the necessary fat. It was now June 4, and Pentecost Sunday,\r\nwhich they kept as a day of rest and thanksgiving. They were no longer\r\nmiserable castaways, they were colonists. On the next day, June 5, they\r\nstarted for the islet. They had to choose the time of low tide to ford\r\nthe channel; and all determined that, somehow or other, they must build\r\na boat which would give them easy communication with all parts of the\r\nisland, and would enable them to go up the Mercy, when they should\r\nundertake that grand exploration of the southwestern district which\r\nthey had reserved for the first good weather.\r\n\r\nSeals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their iron-spiked\r\nspears, easily killed half a dozen of them, which Neb and Pencroff\r\nskinned. Only the hides and fat were carried back to Granite House, the\r\nformer to be made into shoes. The result of the hunt was about 300\r\npounds of fat, every pound of which could be used in making candles.\r\nThe operation was simple enough, and the product, if not the best of\r\nits kind, was all they needed. Had Smith had at his disposition nothing\r\nbut sulphuric acid, he could, by heating this acid with neutral fats,\r\nsuch as the fat of the seal, separate the glycerine, which again could\r\nbe resolved, by means of boiling water, into oleine, margarine, and\r\nstearine. But, to simplify the operation, he preferred to saponify the\r\nfat by lime. He thus obtained a calcareous soap, easily decomposed by\r\nsulphuric acid, which precipitated the lime as a sulphate, and freed\r\nthe fatty acids. The first of these three acids (oleine, margarine, and\r\nstearine) was a liquid which he expelled by pressure. The other two\r\nformed the raw material of the candles.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-four hours the work was done. Wicks were made, after some\r\nunsuccessful attempts, from vegetable fibre, and were steeped in the\r\nliquified compound. They were real stearine candles, made by hand,\r\nwhite and smooth.\r\n\r\nDuring all this month work was going on inside their new abode. There\r\nwas plenty of carpenter’s work to do. They improved and completed their\r\ntools, which were very rudimentary. Scissors were made, among other\r\nthings, so that they were able to cut their hair, and, if not actually\r\nto shave their beards, at least to trim them to their liking. Herbert\r\nhad no beard, and Neb none to speak of, but the others found ample\r\nemployment for the scissors.\r\n\r\nThey had infinite trouble in making a hand-saw; but at last succeeded\r\nin shaping an instrument which would cut wood by a rigorous\r\napplication. Then they made tables, chairs and cupboards to furnish the\r\nprincipal rooms, and the frames of beds whose only bedding was\r\nmattrasses of wrack-grass. The kitchen, with its shelves, on which lay\r\nthe terra-cotta utensils, its brick furnace, and its washing-stone,\r\nlooked very comfortable, and Neb cooked with the gravity of a chemist\r\nin his laboratory.\r\n\r\nBut joiners work had to give place to carpentry. The new weir created\r\nby the explosion rendered necessary the construction of two causeways,\r\none upon Prospect Plateau, the other on the shore itself. Now the\r\nplateau and the coast were transversely cut by a water-course which the\r\ncolonists had to cross when ever they wished to reach the northern part\r\nof the island. To avoid this they had to make a considerable detour,\r\nand to walk westward as far as the sources of Red creek. Their best\r\nplan therefore was to build two causeways, one on the plateau and one\r\non the shore, twenty to twenty-five feet long, simply constructed of\r\ntrees squared by the axe. This was the work of some days. When these\r\nbridges had been built, Neb and Pencroff profited by them to go to the\r\noyster-bed which had been discovered off the down. They dragged after\r\nthem a sort of rough cart which had taken the place of the inconvenient\r\nhurdle; and they brought back several thousand oysters, which, were\r\nreadily acclimated among the rocks, and formed a natural preserve at\r\nthe mouth of the Mercy. They were excellent of their kind, and formed\r\nan almost daily article of diet. In fact, Lincoln Island, though the\r\ncolonists had explored but a small portion of it, already supplied\r\nnearly all their wants, while it seemed likely that a minute\r\nexploration of the western forests would reveal a world of new\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nOnly one privation still distressed the colonists. Azotic food they had\r\nin plenty, and the vegetables which corrected it; from the ligneous\r\nroots of the dragon-trees, submitted to fermentation, they obtained a\r\nsort of acidulated beer. They had even made sugar, without sugar-cane\r\nor beet-root, by collecting the juice which distills from the “acer\r\nsaccharinum,” a sort of maple which flourishes in all parts of the\r\ntemperate zone, and which abounded on the island. They made a very\r\npleasant tea from the plant brought from the warren; and, finally, they\r\nhad plenty of salt, the only mineral component necessary to food—but\r\nbread was still to seek.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, at some future time, they would have been able to replace this\r\naliment by some equivalent, sago flour, or the breadfruit tree, which\r\nthey might possibly have discovered in the woods of the southwest; but\r\nso far they had not met with them. Just at this time a little incident\r\noccurred which brought about what Smith, with all his ingenuity, could\r\nnot have achieved.\r\n\r\nOne rainy day the colonists were together in the large hall of Granite\r\nHouse, when Herbert suddenly cried,\r\n\r\n“See, Mr. Smith, a grain of corn.”\r\n\r\nAnd he showed his companions a single gram which had got into the\r\nlining of his waistcoat through a hole in his pocket. Pencroff had\r\ngiven him some ring-doves in Richmond, and in feeding them one of the\r\ngrains had remained in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“A grain of corn?” said the engineer, quickly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; but only one.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a wonderful help,” said Pencroff, laughing. “The bread that\r\ngrain will make will never choke us.”\r\n\r\nHerbert was about to throw away the grain, when Cyrus Smith took it,\r\nexamined it, found that it was in good condition, and said quietly to\r\nthe sailor:—\r\n\r\n“Pencroff, do you know how many ears of corn will spring from one\r\ngrain?”\r\n\r\n“One, I suppose,” said the sailor, surprised at the question.\r\n\r\n“Ten, Pencroff. And how many grains are there to an ear?”\r\n\r\n“Faith, I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Eighty on an average,” said Smith. “So then, if we plant this grain,\r\nwe shall get from it a harvest of 800 grains; from them in the second\r\nyear 640,000; in the third, 512,000,000; in the fourth, more than\r\n400,000,000,000. That is the proportion.”\r\n\r\nHis companions listened in silence. The figures stupefied them.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend,” resumed the engineer. “Such is the increase of\r\nNature. And what is even this multiplication of a grain of corn whose\r\nears have only 800 grains, compared with the poppy plant, which has\r\n32,000 seeds, or the tobacco plant, which has 360,000? In a few years,\r\nbut for the numerous enemies which destroy them, these plants would\r\ncover the earth. And now, Pencroff,” he resumed, “do you know how many\r\nbushels there are in 400,000,000,000 grains?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the sailor, “I only know that I am an idiot!”\r\n\r\n“Well, there will be more than 3,000,000, at 130,000 the bushel!”\r\n\r\n“Three millions!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Three millions.”\r\n\r\n“In four years?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Smith, “and even in two, if, as I hope, we can get two\r\nharvests a year in this latitude.”\r\n\r\nPencroff answered with a tremendous hurrah.\r\n\r\n“So, Herbert,” added the engineer, “your discovery is of immense\r\nimportance. Remember, my friends, that everything may be of use to us\r\nin our present situation.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Mr. Smith, I will remember it,” said Pencroff, “and if ever I\r\nfind one of those grains of tobacco which increase 360,000 times, I’ll\r\ntake care not to throw it away. And now what must we do?”\r\n\r\n“We must plant this grain,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Spilett, “and with the greatest care, for upon it depend\r\nour future harvests!”\r\n\r\n“Provided that it grows,” said the sailor.\r\n\r\n“It will grow,” answered Smith.\r\n\r\nIt was now the 20th of June, a good time for planting the precious\r\ngrain. They thought at first of planting it in a pot; but upon\r\nconsideration, they determined to trust it frankly to the soil. The\r\nsame day it was planted, with the greatest precaution. The weather\r\nclearing a little, they walked up to the plateau above Granite House,\r\nand chose there a spot well sheltered from the wind, and exposed to the\r\nmidday fervor of the sun. This spot was cleared, weeded, and even dug,\r\nso as to destroy insects and worms; it was covered with a layer of\r\nfresh earth, enriched with a little lime; a palissade was built around\r\nit, and then the grain was covered up in its moist bed.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to be laying the corner-stone of an edifice. Pencroff was\r\nreminded of the extreme care with which they had lighted their only\r\nmatch; but this was a more serious matter. The castaways could always\r\nhave succeeded in obtaining fire by some means or other; but no earthly\r\npower could restore that grain of corn, if, by ill fortune, it should\r\nperish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVERAL DEGREES BELOW ZERO—EXPLORATION OF THE SWAMP REGION TO THE\r\nSOUTHEAST—THE VIEW OF THE SEA—A CONVERSATION CONCERNING THE FUTURE OF\r\nTHE PACIFIC OCEAN—THE INCESSANT LABOR OF THE INFUSORIA—WHAT WILL BECOME\r\nOF THIS GLOBE—THE CHASE—THE SWAMP OF THE TADORNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this moment Pencroff did not let a day pass without visiting what\r\nhe called with perfect gravity, his “corn field.” And alas, for any\r\ninsects that ventured there, no mercy would be shown them. Near the end\r\nof the month of June, after the interminable rains, the weather became\r\ndecidedly cold, and on the 29th, a Fahrenheit thermometer would\r\ncertainly have stood at only 20° above zero.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 30th of June, the day which corresponds to the 3lst\r\nof December in the Northern Hemisphere, was a Friday. Neb said the year\r\nended on an unlucky day, but Pencroff answered that consequently the\r\nnew year began on a lucky one, which was more important. At all events,\r\nit began with a very cold snap. Ice accumulated at the mouth of the\r\nMercy, and the whole surface of the lake was soon frozen over.\r\n\r\nFresh firewood had continually to be procured. Pencroff had not waited\r\nfor the river to freeze to convey enormous loads of wood to their\r\ndestination. The current was a tireless motor, and conveyed the\r\nfloating wood until the ice froze around it. To the fuel, which the\r\nforest so plentifully furnished, were added several cartloads of coal,\r\nwhich they found at the foot of the spurs of Mount Franklin. The\r\npowerful heat from the coal was thoroughly appreciated in a temperature\r\nwhich on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees above zero. A second\r\nchimney had been set up in the dining-room, where they all worked\r\ntogether. During this cold spell Cyrus Smith could not be thankful\r\nenough that he had conducted to Granite House a small stream of water\r\nfrom Lake Grant. Taken below the frozen surface, then conducted through\r\nthe old weir, it arrived unfrozen at the interior reservoir, which had\r\nbeen dug at the angle of the storehouse, and which, when too full,\r\nemptied itself into the sea. About this time the weather being very\r\ndry, the colonists, dressing as warmly as possible, determined to\r\ndevote a day to the exploration of that part of the island situated to\r\nthe southeast, between the Mercy and Claw Cape. It was a large swampy\r\ndistrict and might offer good hunting, as aquatic birds must abound\r\nthere. They would have eight or nine miles to go and as far to return,\r\nconsequently the whole day must be given up. As it concerned the\r\nexploration of an unknown portion of the island, every one had to take\r\npart.\r\n\r\nTherefore, on the 5th of July, at 6 o’clock in the morning, before the\r\nsun had fairly risen, the whole party, armed with spears, snares, bows\r\nand arrows, and furnished with enough provisions for the day, started\r\nfrom Granite House, preceded by Top, who gambolled before them. They\r\ntook the shortest route, which was to cross the Mercy on the blocks of\r\nice which then obstructed it.\r\n\r\n“But,” as the reporter very truly observed, “this cannot supply the\r\nplace of a real bridge.”\r\n\r\nSo the construction of a “real” bridge was set down as work for the\r\nfuture. This was the first time that the colonists had set foot on the\r\nright bank of the Mercy and had plunged into the forest of large and\r\nmagnificent firs, then covered with snow. But they had not gone half a\r\nmile when the barking of Top frightened from a dense thicket where they\r\nhad taken up their abode, a whole family of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n“Why they look like foxes,” said Herbert, when he saw them scampering\r\nquickly away.\r\n\r\nAnd they were foxes, but foxes of enormous size. They made a sort of\r\nbark which seemed to astonish Top, for he stopped in his chase and gave\r\nthese swift animals time to escape. The dog had a right to be\r\nsurprised, for he knew nothing of natural history; but by this barking,\r\nthe greyish-red color of their hair, and their black tails, which ended\r\nin a white tuft, these foxes had betrayed their origin. So Herbert gave\r\nthem without hesitation their true name of culpeux. These culpeux are\r\noften met with in Chili, in the Saint Malo group, and in all those\r\nparts of America lying between the 30th and 40th parallels.\r\n\r\nHerbert was very sorry that Top had not caught one of these carnivora.\r\n\r\n“Can we eat them?” asked Pencroff, who always considered the fauna of\r\nthe island from that special point of view.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Herbert, “but zoologists have not yet ascertained whether\r\nthe pupil of the eye of this fox is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether\r\nthe animal would come under the genus “canine.”\r\n\r\nSmith could not help smiling at this remark of the boy, which showed\r\nthoughtfulness beyond his years. As for the sailor, from the moment\r\nthese foxes ceased to belong to the edible species, they ceased to\r\ninterest him. Ever since the kitchen had been established at Granite\r\nHouse he had been saying that precautions ought to be taken against\r\nthese four-footed plunderers. A fact which no one denied.\r\n\r\nHaving turned Jetsam Point the party came upon a long reach washed by\r\nthe sea. It was then 8 o’clock in the morning. The sky was very clear,\r\nas is usual in prolonged cold weather; but, warmed by their work, Smith\r\nand his companions did not suffer from the sharpness of the atmosphere.\r\nBesides, there was no wind, the absence of which always renders a low\r\ntemperature more endurable. The sun, bright but cold, rose from the\r\nocean, and his enormous disc was poised in the horizon. The sea was a\r\ncalm, blue sheet of water, like a land-locked sea under a clear sky.\r\nClaw Cape, bent in the shape of an ataghan, was clearly defined about\r\nfour miles to the southeast. To the left, the border of the swamp was\r\nabruptly intercepted by a little point which shone brightly against the\r\nsun. Certainly in that part of Union Bay, which was not protected from\r\nthe open sea, even by a sand bank, ships beaten by an east wind could\r\nnot have found shelter.\r\n\r\nBy the perfect calm of the sea, with no shoals to disturb its waters,\r\nby its uniform color, with no tinge of yellow, and, finally, by the\r\nentire absence of reefs, they knew that this side was steep, and that\r\nhere the ocean was fathoms deep. Behind them, in the west, at a\r\ndistance of about four miles, they saw the beginning of the Forests of\r\nthe Far West. They could almost have believed themselves upon some\r\ndesolate island in the Antarctic regions surrounded by ice.\r\n\r\nThe party halted here for breakfast; a fire of brushwood and seaweed\r\nwas lighted, and Neb prepared the meal of cold meat, to which he added\r\nsome cups of Oswego tea. While eating they looked around them. This\r\nside of Lincoln island was indeed barren, and presented a strong\r\ncontrast to the western part.\r\n\r\nThe reporter thought that if the castaways had been thrown upon this\r\ncoast, they would have had a very melancholy impression of their future\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n“I do not believe we could even have reached it,” said the engineer,\r\n“for the sea is very deep here, and there is not even a rock which\r\nwould have served as a refuge; before Granite House there were shoals,\r\nat least, and a little island which multiplied our chances of safety;\r\nhere is only the bottomless sea.”\r\n\r\n“It is curious enough,” said Spilett, “that this island, relatively so\r\nsmall, presents so varied a soil. This diversity of appearance belongs,\r\nlogically, only to continents of a considerable area. One would really\r\nthink that the western side of Lincoln Island, so rich and fertile, was\r\nwashed by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that the northern\r\nand southern coasts extended into a sort of Arctic Sea.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, my dear Spilett,” replied the engineer, “I have\r\nobserved the same thing. I have found this island curious both in its\r\nshape and in its character. It has all the peculiarities of a\r\ncontinent, and I would not be surprised if it had been a continent\r\nformerly.”\r\n\r\n“What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” answered Smith. “Why should not Australia, New Ireland, all\r\nthat the English geographers call Australasia, joined to the\r\nArchipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean, have formed in times past a sixth\r\npart of the world as important as Europe or Asia, Africa or the two\r\nAmericas. My mind does not refuse to admit that all the islands rising\r\nfrom this vast ocean are the mountains of a continent now engulphed,\r\nbut which formerly rose majestically from these waters.”\r\n\r\n“Like Atlantis?” asked Herbert. “Yes. my boy, if that ever existed.”\r\n“And Lincoln Island may have been a part of this continent?” asked\r\nPencroff. “It is probable,” replied Smith. “And that would explain the\r\ndiversity of products upon the surface, and the number of animals which\r\nstill live here,” added Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy,” answered the engineer, “and that gives me a new argument\r\nin support of my theory. It is certain after what we have seen that the\r\nanimals in the island are numerous, and what is more curious, is that\r\nthe species are extremely varied. There must be a reason for this, and\r\nmine is, that Lincoln Island was formerly a part of some vast\r\ncontinent, which has, little by little, sunk beneath the surface of the\r\nPacific.” “Then,” said Pencroff, who did not seem entirely convinced,\r\n“what remains of this old continent may disappear in its turn and leave\r\nnothing between America and Asia.” “Yes,” said Smith, “there will be\r\nnew continents which millions upon millions of animalculæ are building\r\nat this moment.” “And who are these masons?” inquired Pencroff. “The\r\ncoral insects,” answered Smith. “It is these who have built by their\r\nconstant labor the Island of Clermont Tonnerre, the Atolls and many\r\nother coral islands which abound in the Pacific. It takes 47,000,000 of\r\nthese insects to deposit one particle; and yet with the marine salt\r\nwhich they absorb, and the solid elements of the water which they\r\nassimilate, these animalculæ produce limestone, and limestone forms\r\nthose enormous submarine structures whose hardness and solidity is\r\nequal to that of granite.\r\n\r\nFormerly, during the first epochs of creation, Nature employed heat to\r\nproduce land by upheaval, but now she lets these microscopic insects\r\nreplace this agent, whose dynamic power at the interior of this globe\r\nhas evidently diminished. This fact is sufficiently proved by the great\r\nnumber of volcanoes actually extinct on the surface of the earth. I\r\nverily believe that century after century, and infusoria after\r\ninfusoria will change the Pacific some day into a vast continent, which\r\nnew generations will, in their turn, inhabit and civilize.”\r\n\r\n“It will take a long time,” said Pencroff. “Nature has time on her\r\nside,” replied the engineer. “But what is the good of new continents?”\r\nasked Herbert. “It seems to me that the present extent of habitable\r\ncountries is enough for mankind. Now Nature does nothing in vain.”\r\n“Nothing in vain, indeed,” replied the engineer; “but let us see how we\r\ncan explain the necessity of new continents in the future, and\r\nprecisely in these tropical regions occupied by these coral islands.\r\nHere is an explanation, which seems to me at least plausible.”\r\n\r\n“We are listening, Mr. Smith,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“This is my idea: Scientists generally admit that some day the globe\r\nmust come to an end, or rather the animal and vegetable life will be no\r\nlonger possible, on account of the intense cold which will prevail.\r\nWhat they cannot agree upon is the cause of this cold. Some think that\r\nit will be produced by the cooling of the sun in the course of millions\r\nof years; others by the gradual extinction of the internal fires of our\r\nown globe, which have a more decided influence than is generally\r\nsupposed. I hold to this last hypothesis, based upon the fact that the\r\nmoon is without doubt a refrigerated planet, which is no longer\r\nhabitable, although the sun continues to pour upon its surface the same\r\namount of heat. If then, the moon is refrigerated, it is because these\r\ninternal fires, to which like all the stellar world it owes its origin,\r\nare entirely extinct. In short, whatever be the cause, our world will\r\ncertainly some day cool; but this cooling will take place gradually.\r\nWhat will happen then? Why, the temperate zones, at a time more or less\r\ndistant, will be no more habitable than are the Polar regions now. Then\r\nhuman, as well as animal life, will be driven to latitudes more\r\ndirectly under the influence of the solar rays. An immense emigration\r\nwill take place. Europe, Central Asia, and North America will little by\r\nlittle be abandoned, as well as Australasia and the lower parts of\r\nSouth America. Vegetation will follow the human emigration. The flora\r\nwill move towards the equator at the same time with the fauna, the\r\ncentral parts of South America and Africa will become the inhabited\r\ncontinent. The Laplanders and the Samoyedes will find the climate of\r\nthe Polar Sea on the banks of the Mediterranean. Who can tell but that\r\nat this epoch, the equatorial regions will not be too small to contain\r\nand nourish the population of the globe. Now, why should not a\r\nprovident nature, in order from this time, to provide a refuge for this\r\nanimal and vegetable emigration, lay the foundation, under the equator,\r\nof a new continent, and charge these infusoria with the building of it?\r\nI have often thought of this, my friends, and I seriously believe that,\r\nsome day, the aspect of our globe will be completely transformed, that\r\nafter the upheaval of new continents the seas will cover the old ones,\r\nand that in future ages some Columbus will discover in the islands of\r\nChimborazo or the Himalaya, or Mount Blanc, all that remains of an\r\nAmerica, an Asia, and a Europe. Then at last, these new continents, in\r\ntheir turn, will become uninhabitable. The heat will die out as does\r\nthe heat from a body whose soul has departed, and life will disappear\r\nfrom the globe, if not forever, at least for a time. Perhaps then our\r\nsphere will rest from its changes, and will prepare in death to live\r\nagain under nobler conditions.\r\n\r\n“But all this my friends, is with the Creator of all things. From the\r\ntalking of the work of these infusoria I have been led into too deep a\r\nscrutiny of the secrets of the future.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Cyrus,” said the reporter, “these theories are to me\r\nprophesies. Some day they will be accomplished.”\r\n\r\n“It is a secret with the Almighty,” replied Smith.\r\n\r\n“All this is well and good,” said Pencroff, who had listened with all\r\nhis ears, “but will you tell me, Mr. Smith, if Lincoln Island has been\r\nconstructed by these infusoria.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Smith, “it is of purely volcanic origin.”\r\n\r\n“Then it will probably disappear some day. I hope sincerely we won’t be\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“No, be easy, Pencroff, we will get away.”\r\n\r\n“In the meantime,” said Spilett, “let us settle ourselves as if\r\nforever. It is never worth while to do anything by halves.”\r\n\r\nThis ended the conversation. Breakfast was over, the exploration\r\ncontinued, and the party soon arrived at the beginning of the swampy\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a marsh which extended as far as the rounded side\r\nforming the southeastern termination of the island, and measuring\r\ntwenty square miles. The soil was formed of a silicious clay mixed with\r\ndecayed vegetation. It was covered by confervæ, rushes, sedges, and\r\nhere and there by beds of herbage, thick as a velvet carpet. In many\r\nplaces frozen pools glistened under the sun’s rays. Neither rains, nor\r\nany river swollen by a sudden increase could have produced this water.\r\nOne would naturally conclude that this swamp was fed by the\r\ninfiltration of water through the soil. And this was the fact. It was\r\neven to be feared that the air here during hot weather, was laden with\r\nthat miasma which engenders the marsh fever. Above the aquatic herbs on\r\nthe surface of the stagnant waters, a swarm of birds were flying. A\r\nhunter would not have lost a single shot. Wild ducks, teal, and snipe\r\nlived there in flocks, and it was easy to approach these fearless\r\ncreatures. So thick were these birds that a charge of shot would\r\ncertainly have brought down a dozen of them, but our friends had to\r\ncontent themselves with their bows and arrows. The slaughter was less,\r\nbut the quiet arrow had the advantage of not frightening the birds,\r\nwhile the sound of fire-arms would have scattered them to every corner\r\nof the swamp. The hunters contented themselves this time with a dozen\r\nducks, with white bodies, cinnamon-colored belts, green heads, wings\r\nblack, white, and red, and feathered beaks. These Herbert recognized as\r\nthe “Tadorns.” Top did his share well in the capture of these birds,\r\nwhose name was given this swampy district.\r\n\r\nThe colonists now had an abundant reserve of aquatic game. When the\r\ntime should come the only question would be how to make a proper use of\r\nthem, and it was probable that several species of these birds would be,\r\nif not domesticated, at least acclimated, upon the borders of the lake,\r\nwhich would bring them nearer to the place of consumption.\r\n\r\nAbout 5 o’clock in the afternoon Smith and his companions turned their\r\nfaces homewards. They crossed Tadorn’s Fens, and re-crossed the Mercy\r\nupon the ice, arriving at Granite House at 8 o’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAPS—THE FOXES—THE PECCARIES —THE WIND VEERS TO THE NORTHWEST —THE\r\nSNOW-STORM—THE BASKET-MAKERS —THE COLDEST SNAP OF WINTER\r\n—CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE SUGAR-MAPLE —THE MYSTERIOUS SHAFTS—THE\r\nPROJECTED EXPLORATION—THE PELLET OF LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intense cold lasted until the 15th of August, the thermometer never\r\nrising above the point hitherto observed. When the atmosphere was calm\r\nthis low temperature could be easily borne; but when the wind blew, the\r\npoor fellows suffered much for want of warmer clothing. Pencroff\r\nregretted that Lincoln Island, instead of harboring so many foxes and\r\nseals, with no fur to speak of, did not shelter some families of bears.\r\n\r\n“Bears,” said he, “are generally well dressed; and I would ask nothing\r\nbetter for the winter than the loan of their warm cloaks.”.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps,” said Neb, laughing “These bears would not consent to\r\ngive you their cloak. Pencroff, these fellows are no Saint Martins.”\r\n\r\n“We would make them, Neb, we would make them,” answered Pencroff in a\r\ntone of authority.\r\n\r\nBut these formidable carnivora did not dwell on the island, or if they\r\ndid, had not yet shown themselves. Herbert, Pencroff, and the reporter\r\nwere constantly at work getting traps on Prospect Plateau and on the\r\nborders of the forest. In the sailor’s opinion any animal whatever\r\nwould be a prize, and rodents or carnivora, whichever these new traps\r\nshould entice, would be well received at Granite House. These traps\r\nwere very simple. They were pits dug in the ground and covered with\r\nbranches and grass, which hid the openings. At the bottom they placed\r\nsome bait, whose odor would attract the animals. They used their\r\ndiscretion about the position of their traps, choosing places where\r\nnumerous footprints indicated the frequent passage of quadrupeds. Every\r\nday they went to look at them, and at three different times during the\r\nfirst few days they found in them specimens of those foxes which had\r\nbeen already seen on the right bank of the Mercy.\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! there are nothing but foxes in this part of the world,” said\r\nPencroff, as, for the third time, he drew one of these animals out of\r\nthe pit. “Good-for-nothing beasts;”\r\n\r\n“Stop,” said Spilett; “they are good for something.”\r\n\r\n“For what?”\r\n\r\n“To serve as bait to attract others!”\r\n\r\nThe reporter was right, and from this time the traps were baited with\r\nthe dead bodies of foxes. The sailor had made snares out of the threads\r\nof curry-jonc, and these snares were more profitable than the traps. It\r\nwas a rare thing for a day to pass without some rabbit from the warren\r\nbeing captured. It was always a rabbit, but Neb knew how to vary his\r\nsauces, and his companions did not complain. However, once or twice in\r\nthe second week in August, the traps contained other and more useful\r\nanimals than the foxes. There were some of those wild boars which had\r\nbeen already noticed at the north of the lake. Pencroff had no need to\r\nask if these animals were edible, that was evident from their\r\nresemblance to the hog of America and Europe.\r\n\r\n“But these are not hogs, let me tell you,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“My boy,” replied the sailor, handing over the trap and drawing out one\r\nof these representatives of the swine family by the little appendage\r\nwhich served for a tail, “do let me believe them to be hogs.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because it pleases me.”\r\n\r\n“You are fond of hogs, then, Pencroff?”\r\n\r\n“I am very fond of them,” replied the sailor, “especially of their\r\nfeet, and if any had eight instead of four I would like them twice as\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\nThese animals were peccaries, belonging to one of the four genera,\r\nwhich make up that family. This particular species were the\r\n“tajassans,” known by there dark color and the absence of those long\r\nfangs which belong to the others of their race. Peccaries generally\r\nlive in herds, and it was likely that these animals abounded in the\r\nwoody parts of the island. At all events they were edible from head to\r\nfoot, and Pencroff asked nothing more.\r\n\r\nAbout the 15th of August the weather moderated suddenly by a change of\r\nwind to the northwest. The temperature rose several degrees higher, and\r\nthe vapors accumulated in the air were soon resolved into snow. The\r\nwhole island was covered with a white mantle, and presented a new\r\naspect to its inhabitants. It snowed hard for several days and the\r\nground was covered two feet deep. The wind soon rose with great\r\nviolence and from the top of Granite House they could hear the sea\r\nroaring against the reefs.\r\n\r\nAt certain angles the wind made eddies in the air, and the snow,\r\nforming itself into high whirling columns, looked like those twisting\r\nwaterspouts which vessels attack with cannon. The hurricane, coming\r\nsteadily from the northwest, spent its force on the other side of the\r\nisland, and the eastern lookout of Granite House preserved it from a\r\ndirect attack.\r\n\r\nDuring this snow-storm, as terrible as those of the polar regions,\r\nneither Smith nor his companions could venture outside. They were\r\ncompletely housed for five days, from the 20th to the 25th of August.\r\nThey heard the tempest roar though Jacamar Woods, which must have\r\nsuffered sadly. Doubtless numbers of trees were uprooted, but Pencroff\r\ncomforted himself with the reflection that there would be fewer to cut\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n“The wind will be wood-cutter; let it alone,” said he.\r\n\r\nHow fervently now the inhabitants of Granite House must have thanked\r\nHeaven for having given to them this solid and impenetrable shelter!\r\nSmith had his share of their gratitude, but after all, it was nature\r\nwhich had hollowed out this enormous cave, and he had only discovered\r\nit. Here all were in safety, the violence of the tempest could not\r\nreach them. If they had built a house of brick and wood on Prospect\r\nPlateau, it could not have resisted the fury of this hurricane. As for\r\nthe Chimneys, they heard the billows strike them with such violence\r\nthat they knew they must be uninhabitable, for the sea, having entirely\r\ncovered their islet, beat upon them with all its force.\r\n\r\nBut here at Granite House, between these solid walls which neither wind\r\nnor water could effect, they had nothing to fear. During this\r\nconfinement the colonists were not idle. There was plenty of wood in\r\nthe storehouse cut into planks, and little by little they completed\r\ntheir stock of furniture. As far as tables and chairs went they were\r\ncertainly solid enough, for the material was not spared. This furniture\r\nwas a little too heavy to fulfil its essential purpose of being easily\r\nmoved, but it was the pride of Neb and Pencroff, who would not have\r\nexchanged it for the handsomest Buhl.\r\n\r\nThen the carpenters turned basket-makers, and succeeded remarkably well\r\nat this new occupation.\r\n\r\nThey had discovered at the northern part of the lake a thick growth of\r\npurple osiers. Before the rainy season, Pencroff and Herbert had\r\ngathered a good many of these useful shrubs; and their branches, being\r\nnow well seasoned, could be used to advantage. Their first specimens\r\nwere rough; but, thanks to the skill and intelligence of the workmen\r\nconsulting together, recalling the models they had seen, and rivalling\r\neach other in their efforts, hampers and baskets of different sizes\r\nhere soon added to the stock of the colony. The storehouse was filled\r\nwith them, and Neb set away in special baskets his stock of pistachio\r\nnuts and roots of the dragon tree.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week in August the weather changed again, the\r\ntemperature fell a little, and the storm was over. The colonists at\r\nonce started out. There must have been at least two feet of snow on the\r\nshore, but it was frozen over the top, which made it easy to walk over.\r\nSmith and his companions climbed up Prospect Plateau. What a change\r\nthey beheld! The woods which they had left in bloom, especially the\r\npart nearest to them where the conifers were plenty, were now one\r\nuniform color.\r\n\r\nEverything was white, from the top of Mount Franklin to the\r\ncoast—forests, prairie, lake, river, beach. The waters of the Mercy ran\r\nunder a vault of ice, which cracked and broke with a loud noise at\r\nevery change of tide. Thousands of birds—ducks and wood-peckers—flew\r\nover the surface of the lake. The rocks between which the cascade\r\nplunged to the borders of the Plateau were blocked up with ice. One\r\nwould have said that the water leaped out of a huge gargoyle, cut by\r\nsome fantastic artist of the Renaissance. To calculate the damage done\r\nto the forest by this hurricane would be impossible until the snow had\r\nentirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nSpilett, Pencroff, and Herbert took this opportunity to look after\r\ntheir traps and had hard work finding them under their bed of snow.\r\nThere was danger of their falling in themselves; a humiliating thing to\r\nbe caught in one’s own trap! They were spared this annoyance, however,\r\nand found the traps had been untouched; not an animal had been caught,\r\nalthough there were a great many footprints in the neighborhood, among\r\nothers, very clearly impressed marks of claws.\r\n\r\nHerbert at once classified these carnivora among the cat tribe, a\r\ncircumstance which justified the engineer’s belief in the existence of\r\ndangerous beasts on Lincoln Island. Doubtless these beasts dwelt in the\r\ndense forests of the Far West; but driven by hunger, they had ventured\r\nas far as Prospect Plateau. Perhaps they scented the inhabitants of\r\nGranite House.\r\n\r\n“What, exactly, are these carnivora?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“They are tigers,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I thought those animals were only found in warm countries.”\r\n\r\n“In the New World,” replied the lad, “they are to be found from Mexico\r\nto the pampas of Buenos Ayres. Now, as Lincoln Island is in almost the\r\nsame latitude as La Plata, it is not surprising that tigers are found\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“All right, we will be on our guard,” replied Pencroff.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the temperature rising, the snow began to melt, it\r\ncame on to rain, and gradually the white mantle disappeared.\r\nNotwithstanding the bad weather the colonists renewed their stock of\r\nprovisions, both animal and vegetable.\r\n\r\nThis necessitated excursions into the forest, and thus they discovered\r\nhow many trees had been beaten down by the hurricane. The sailor and\r\nNeb pushed forward with their wagon as far as the coal deposit in order\r\nto carry back some fuel. They saw on their way that the chimney of the\r\npottery oven had been much damaged by the storm; at least six feet had\r\nbeen blown down.\r\n\r\nThey also renewed their stock of wood as well as that of coal, and the\r\nMercy having become free once more, they employed the current to draw\r\nseveral loads to Granite House. It might be that the cold season was\r\nnot yet over.\r\n\r\nA visit had been made to the Chimneys also, and the colonists could not\r\nbe sufficiently grateful that this had not been their home during the\r\ntempest. The sea had left undoubted signs of its ravages. Lashed by the\r\nfury of the wind from the offing, and rushing over Safety Island, it\r\nspent its full force upon these passages, leaving them half full of\r\nsand and the rocks thickly covered with seaweed.\r\n\r\nWhile Neb, Herbert, and Pencroff spent their time in hunting and\r\nrenewing their supply of fuel, Smith andSpilett set to work to clear\r\nout the Chimneys. They found the forge and furnaces almost unhurt, so\r\ncarefully protected had they been by the banks of sand which the\r\ncolonists had built around them.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate thing that they laid in a fresh supply of fuel, for\r\nthe colonists had not yet seen the end of the intense cold. It is well\r\nknown that in the Northern Hemisphere, the month of February is noted\r\nfor its low temperature. The same rule held good in the Southern\r\nHemisphere, and the end of August, which is the February of North\r\nAmerica, did not escape from this climatic law.\r\n\r\nAbout the 25th, after another snow and rain storm, the wind veered to\r\nthe southeast, and suddenly the cold became intense. In the engineer’s\r\nopinion, a Fahrenheit thermometer would have indicated about eight\r\ndegrees below zero, and the cold was rendered more severe by a cutting\r\nwind which lasted for several days.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were completely housed again, and as they were obliged to\r\nblock up all their windows, only leaving one narrow opening for\r\nventilation, the consumption of candles was considerable. In order to\r\neconomize them, the colonists often contented themselves with only the\r\nlight from the fire; for fuel was plenty.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice some of them ventured to the beach, among the blocks of\r\nice which were heaped up there by every fresh tide. But they soon\r\nclimbed up to Granite House again. This ascent was very painful, as\r\ntheir hands were frostbitten by holding on to the frozen sides of the\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nThere were still many leisure hours to be filled up during this long\r\nconfinement, so Smith undertook another indoor occupation.\r\n\r\nThe only sugar which they had had up to this time was a liquid\r\nsubstance which they had procured by making deep cuts in the bark of\r\nthe maple tree. They collected this liquid in jars and used it in this\r\ncondition for cooking purposes. It improved with age, becoming whiter\r\nand more like a syrup in consistency. But they could do better than\r\nthis, and one day Cyrus Smith announced to his companions that he was\r\ngoing to turn them into refiners.\r\n\r\n“Refiners! I believe that’s a warm trade?” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Very warm!” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Then it will suit this season!” answered the sailor.\r\n\r\nRefining did not necessitate a stock of complicated tools or skilled\r\nworkmen; it was a very simple operation.\r\n\r\nTo crystallize this liquid they first clarified it, by putting it on\r\nthe fire in earthenware jars, and submitting it to evaporation. Soon a\r\nscum rose to the surface, which, when it began to thicken, Neb removed\r\ncarefully with a wooden ladle. This hastened the evaporation, and at\r\nthe same time prevented it from scorching.\r\n\r\nAfter several hours boiling over a good fire, which did as much good to\r\nthe cooks as it did to the boiling liquid, it turned into a thick\r\nsyrup. This syrup was poured into clay moulds which they had made\r\nbeforehand, in various shapes in the same kitchen furnace.\r\n\r\nThe next day the syrup hardened, forming cakes and loaves. It was sugar\r\nof a reddish color, but almost transparent, and of a delicious taste.\r\n\r\nThe cold continued until the middle of September, and the inmates of\r\nGranite House began to find their captivity rather tedious. Almost\r\nevery day they took a run out-doors, but they always soon returned.\r\nThey were constantly at work over their household duties, and talked\r\nwhile they worked.\r\n\r\nSmith instructed his companions in everything, and especially explained\r\nto them the practical applications of science.\r\n\r\nThe colonists had no library at their disposal, but the engineer was a\r\nbook, always ready, always open at the wished-for page. A book which\r\nanswered their every question, and one which they often read. Thus the\r\ntime passed, and these brave man had no fear for the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, they were all anxious for the end of their captivity, and\r\nlonged to see, if not fine weather, at least a cessation of the intense\r\ncold. If they had only had warmer clothing, they would have attempted\r\nexcursions to the downs and to Tadorns’ Fens, for game would have been\r\neasy to approach, and the hunt would assuredly have been fruitful. But\r\nSmith insisted that no one should compromise his health, as he had need\r\nof every hand; and his advice was taken.\r\n\r\nThe most impatient of the prisoners, after Pencroff, was Top. The poor\r\ndog found himself in close quarters in Granite House, and ran from room\r\nto room, showing plainly the uneasiness he felt at this confinement.\r\n\r\nSmith often noticed that whenever he approached the dark well\r\ncommunicating with the sea, which had its opening in the rear of the\r\nstorehouse, Top whined in a most curious manner, and ran around and\r\naround the opening, which had been covered over with planks of wood.\r\nSometimes he even tried to slip his paws under the planks, as if trying\r\nto raise them up, and yelped in a way which indicated at the same time\r\nanger and uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe engineer several times noticed this strange behavior, and wondered\r\nwhat there could be in the abyss to have such a peculiar effect upon\r\nthis intelligent dog.\r\n\r\nThis well, of course, communicated with the sea. Did it then branch off\r\ninto narrow passages through the rock-work of the island? Was it in\r\ncommunication with other caves? Did any sea-monsters come into it from\r\ntime to time from the bottom of these pits?\r\n\r\nThe engineer did not know what to think, and strange thoughts passed\r\nthrough his mind. Accustomed to investigate scientific truths, he could\r\nnot pardon himself for being drawn into the region of the mysterious\r\nand supernatural; but how explain why Top, the most sensible of dogs,\r\nwho never lost his time in barking at the moon, should insist upon\r\nexploring this abyss with nose and ear, if there was nothing there to\r\narouse his suspicions?\r\n\r\nTop’s conduct perplexed Smith more than he cared to own to himself.\r\nHowever, the engineer did not mention this to any one but Spilett,\r\nthinking it useless to worry his companions with what might be, after\r\nall, only a freak of the dog.\r\n\r\nAt last the cold spell was over. They had rain, snow-squalls,\r\nhail-storms, and gales of wind, but none of these lasted long. The ice\r\nthawed and the snow melted; the beach, plateau, banks of the Mercy, and\r\nthe forest were again accessible. The return of spring rejoiced the\r\ninmates of Granite House, and they soon passed all their time in the\r\nopen air, only returning to eat and sleep.\r\n\r\nThey hunted a good deal during the latter part of September, which led\r\nPencroff to make fresh demands for those fire-arms which he declared\r\nSmith had promised him. Smith always put him off, knowing that without\r\na special stock of tools it would be almost impossible to make a gun\r\nwhich would be of any use to them.\r\n\r\nBesides, he noticed that Herbert and Spilett had become very clever\r\narchers, that all sorts of excellent game, both feathered and\r\nfurred—agoutis, kangaroos, cabiais, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, and\r\nsnipe—fell under their arrows; consequently the firearms could wait.\r\nBut the stubborn sailor did not see it in this light, and constantly\r\nreminded the engineer that he had not provided them with guns; and\r\nGideon Spilett supported Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“If,” said he, “the island contains, as we suppose, wild beasts, we\r\nmust consider how to encounter and exterminate them. The time may come\r\nwhen this will be our first duty.”\r\n\r\nBut just now it was not the question of firearms which occupied Smith’s\r\nmind, but that of clothes. Those which the colonists were wearing had\r\nlasted through the winter, but could not hold out till another. What\r\nthey must have at any price was skins of the carnivora, or wool of the\r\nruminants; and as moufflons (mountain goats), were plenty, they must\r\nconsider how to collect a flock of them which they could keep for the\r\nbenefit of the colony. They would also lay out a farm yard in a\r\nfavorable part of the island, where they could have an enclosure for\r\ndomestic animals and a poultry yard.\r\n\r\nThese important projects must be carried out during the good weather.\r\nConsequently, in view of these future arrangements, it was important to\r\nundertake a reconnoissance into the unexplored part of Lincoln Island,\r\nto wit:—the high forests which extended along the right bank of the\r\nMercy, from its mouth to the end of Serpentine Peninsula. But they must\r\nbe sure of their weather, and a month must yet elapse before it would\r\nbe worth while to undertake this exploration. While they were waiting\r\nimpatiently, an incident occurred which redoubled their anxiety to\r\nexamine the whole island.\r\n\r\nIt was now the 24th of October. On this day Pencroff went to look after\r\nhis traps which he always kept duly baited. In one of them, he found\r\nthree animals, of a sort welcome to the kitchen. It was a female\r\npeccary with her two little ones. Pencroff returned to Granite House,\r\ndelighted with his prize, and, as usual, made a great talk about it.\r\n\r\n“Now, we’ll have a good meal, Mr Smith,” cried he, “and you too, Mr.\r\nSpilett, must have some.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted,” said the reporter, “but what is it you want me\r\nto eat?”\r\n\r\n“Sucking pig,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Oh, a suckling-pig! To hear you talk one would think you had brought\r\nback a stuffed partridge!”\r\n\r\n“Umph,” said Pencroff, “so you turn up your nose at my suckling pig?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Spilett coolly, “provided one does not get too much of\r\nthem—”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Mr. Reporter!” returned the sailor, who did not like to\r\nhear his game disparaged. “You are getting fastidious! Seven months\r\nago, when we were cast upon this island, you would have been only too\r\nglad to have come across such game.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said the reporter, “men are never satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” continued Pencroff, “I hope Neb will distinguish himself.\r\nLet us see; these little peccaries are only three months old, they will\r\nbe as tender as quail. Come, Neb, I will superintend the cooking of\r\nthem myself.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor, followed by Neb, hastened to the kitchen, and was soon\r\nabsorbed over the oven. The two prepared a magnificent repast; the two\r\nlittle peccaries, kangaroo soup, smoked ham, pistachio nuts,\r\ndragon-tree wine, Oswego tea; in a word, everything of the best. But\r\nthe favorite dish of all was the savory peccaries made into a stew. At\r\n5 o’clock, dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House. The\r\nkangaroo soup smoked upon the table. It was pronounced excellent.\r\n\r\nAfter the soup came the peccaries, which Pencroff begged to be allowed\r\nto carve, and of which he gave huge pieces to every one. These suckling\r\npigs were indeed delicious, and Pencroff plied his knife and fork with\r\nintense earnestness, when suddenly a cry and an oath escaped him.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“The matter is that I have just lost a tooth!” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Are there pebbles in your peccaries, then?” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“It seems so,” said the sailor, taking out of his mouth the object\r\nwhich had cost him a grinder.\r\n\r\nIt was not a pebble, it was a leaden pellet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\nTHE ABANDONED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE LEADEN PELLET—MAKING A CANOE—HUNTING—IN THE TOP OF A\r\nKAURI—NOTHING TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF MAN—THE TURTLE ON ITS\r\nBACK—THE TURTLE DISAPPEARS—SMITH’S EXPLANATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was exactly seven months since the passengers in the balloon had\r\nbeen thrown upon Lincoln Island. In all this time no human being had\r\nbeen seen. No smoke had betrayed the presence of man upon he island. No\r\nwork of man’s hands, either ancient or modern, had attested his\r\npassage. Not only did it seem uninhabited at present, but it appeared\r\nto have been so always. And now all the framework of deductions fell\r\nbefore a little bit of metal found in the body of a pig.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a bullet from a gun, and what but a human being would\r\nbe so provided?\r\n\r\nWhen Pencroff had placed it upon the table, his companions looked at it\r\nwith profound astonishment. The possibilities suggested by this\r\nseemingly trivial incident flashed before them. The sudden appearance\r\nof a supernatural being could not have impressed them more.\r\n\r\nSmith instantly began to reason upon the theories which this incident,\r\nas surprising as it was unexpected, suggested. Taking the bit of lead\r\nbetween his fingers he turned it round and about for some time before\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n“You are sure, Pencroff,” he asked, at length, “that the peccary was\r\nhardly three months old?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure, sir,” answered the sailor. “It was sucking its mother when I\r\nfound it in the ditch.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, that proves that within three months a gun has been fired\r\nupon Lincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“And that the bullet has wounded, though not mortally, this little\r\nanimal,” added Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Smith; “and now let us see what conclusions are\r\nto be drawn from this incident. Either the island was inhabited before\r\nour arrival, or men have landed here within three months. How these men\r\narrived, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, whether by landing or by\r\nshipwreck, cannot be settled at present. Neither have we any means of\r\ndetermining whether they are Europeans or Malays, friends or enemies;\r\nnor do we know whether they are living here at present or whether they\r\nhave gone. But these questions are too important to be allowed to\r\nremain undecided.”\r\n\r\n“No!” cried the sailor springing from the table. “There can be no men\r\nbesides ourselves on Lincoln Island. Why, the island is not large: and\r\nif it had been inhabited, we must have met some one of its people\r\nbefore this.”\r\n\r\n“It would, indeed, be astonishing if we had not,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“But it would be much more astonishing, I think,” remarked the\r\nreporter, “if this little beast had been born with a bullet in his\r\nbody!”\r\n\r\n“Unless,” suggested Neb, seriously, “Pencroff had had it—”\r\n\r\n“How’s that, Neb?” interrupted the sailor, “I, to have had a bullet in\r\nmy jaw for five or six months, without knowing it? Where would it have\r\nbeen?” he added, opening his mouth and displaying the thirty-two\r\nsplendid teeth that ornamented it. “Look, Neb, and if you can find one\r\nbroken one in the whole set you may pull out half-a-dozen!”\r\n\r\n“Neb’s theory is inadmissible,” said Smith, who, in spite of the\r\ngravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile. “It is certain\r\nthat a gun has been discharged on the island within three months. But I\r\nam bound to believe that the persons on this island have been here but\r\na short time, or else simply landed in passing; as, had the island had\r\ninhabitants when we made the ascent of Mount Franklin, we must have\r\nseen them or been seen. It is more probable, that within the past few\r\nweeks some people have been shipwrecked somewhere upon the coast; the\r\nthing, therefore, to do is to discover this point.”\r\n\r\n“I think we should act cautiously,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“I think so, too,” replied Smith, “as I fear that they must be Malay\r\npirates;”\r\n\r\n“How would it do, Mr. Smith,” said the sailor, “to build A canoe so\r\nthat we could go up this river, or, if need be, round the coast? It\r\nwon’t do to be taken unawares.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a good idea,” answered the engineer; “but we have not the time\r\nnow. It would take at least a month to build a canoe—”\r\n\r\n“A regular one, yes,” rejoined the sailor; “but we don’t want it to\r\nstand the sea. I will guarantee to make one in less than five days that\r\nwill do to use on the Mercy.”\r\n\r\n“Build a boat in five days,” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Neb, one of Indian fashion.”\r\n\r\n“Of wood?” demanded the negro, still incredulous.\r\n\r\n“Of wood, or what is better, of bark,” answered Pencroff. “Indeed, Mr.\r\nSmith, it could be done in five days!”\r\n\r\n“Be it so, then,” answered the engineer. “In five days.”\r\n\r\n“But we must look out for ourselves in the meantime!” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“With the utmost caution, my friends,” answered Smith. “And be very\r\ncareful to confine your hunting expeditions to the neighborhood of\r\nGranite House.”\r\n\r\nThe dinner was finished in lower spirits than Pencroff had expected.\r\nThe incident of the bullet proved beyond doubt that the island had\r\nbeen, or was now, inhabited by others, and such a discovery awakened\r\nthe liveliest anxiety in the breasts of the colonists.\r\n\r\nSmith and Spilett, before retiring, had a long talk about these things.\r\nThey questioned, if by chance this incident had an connection with the\r\nunexplained rescue of the engineer, and other strange events which they\r\nhad encountered in so many ways. Smith, after having discussed the pros\r\nand cons of the question, ended by saying:—\r\n\r\n“In short, Spilett, do you want to know my opinion?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cyrus.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this is it. No matter how minutely we examine the island, we\r\nwill find nothing!”\r\n\r\nPencroff began his work the next day. He did not mean to build a boat\r\nwith ribs and planks, but simply a flat bottomed float, which would do\r\nadmirably in the Mercy, especially in the shallow water and its\r\nsources. Strips of bark fastened together would be sufficient for their\r\npurpose, and in places where a portage would be necessary the affair\r\nwould be neither heavy nor cumbersome. The sailor’s idea was to fasten\r\nthe strips of bark together with clinched nails, and thus to make the\r\ncraft staunch.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to select trees furnishing a supple and tough bark.\r\nNow, it had happened that the last storm had blown down a number of\r\nDouglass pines, which were perfectly adapted to this purpose. Some of\r\nthese lay prone upon the earth, and all the colonists had to do was to\r\nstrip them of their bark, though this indeed was somewhat difficult, on\r\naccount of the awkwardness of their tools.\r\n\r\nWhile the sailor, assisted by the engineer was thus occupied, Herbert\r\nand Spilett, who had been made purveyors to the colony, were not idle.\r\nThe reporter could not help admiring the young lad, who had acquired a\r\nremarkable proficiency in the use of the bow and arrows, and who\r\nexhibited, withal, considerable hardiness and coolness. The two\r\nhunters, remembering the caution of the engineer, never ventured more\r\nthan two miles from Granite House, but the outskirts of the forest\r\nfurnished a sufficient supply of agoutis, cabiais, kangaroos,\r\npeccaries, etc., and although the traps had not done so well since the\r\ncold had abated, the warren furnished a supply sufficient for the wants\r\nof the colonists.\r\n\r\nOften, while on these excursions, Herbert conversed with Spilett about\r\nthe incident of the bullet and of the engineer’s conclusions, and one\r\nday—the 26th of October—he said:—\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think it strange, Mr. Spilett, that any people should have\r\nbeen wrecked on this island, and never have followed up the coast to\r\nGranite House?”\r\n\r\n“Very strange if they are still here,” answered the reporter, “but not\r\nat all astonishing if they are not.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think they have gone again?”\r\n\r\n“It is likely, my boy, that, if they had staid any time, or were still\r\nhere, something would have discovered their presence.”\r\n\r\n“But if they had been able to get off again they were not really\r\nshipwrecked.”\r\n\r\n“No, Herbert, they were what I should call shipwrecked temporarily.\r\nThat is, it is possible that they were driven by stress of weather upon\r\nthe island, without having to abandon their vessel, and when the wind\r\nmoderated they set out again.”\r\n\r\n“One thing is certain,” said Herbert, “and that is, that Mr. Smith has\r\nalways seemed to dread, rather than to desire, the presence of human\r\nbeings on our island.”\r\n\r\n“The reason is, that he knows that only Malays frequent these seas, and\r\nthese gentlemen are a kind of rascals that had better be avoided.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not possible, sir, that some time we will discover traces of\r\ntheir landing and, perhaps, be able to settle this point?”\r\n\r\n“It is not unlikely, my boy. An abandoned camp or the remains of a\r\nfire, we would certainly notice, and these are what we will look for on\r\nour exploration.”\r\n\r\nThe hunters, talking in this way, found themselves in a portion of the\r\nforest near the Mercy, remarkable for its splendid trees. Among others,\r\nwere those magnificent conifera, called by the New Zealanders “kauris,”\r\nrising mere than 200 feet in height.\r\n\r\n“I have an idea, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert, “supposing I climb to the\r\ntop of one of these kauris, I could see, perhaps, for a good ways.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a good idea,” answered the other, “but can you climb one of these\r\ngiants?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to try, anyhow,” exclaimed the boy, springing upon the\r\nlower branches of one, which grew in such a manner as to make the tree\r\neasy to mount. In a few minutes he was in its top, high above all the\r\nsurrounding leafage of the forest.\r\n\r\nFrom this height, the eye could take in all the southern portion of the\r\nisland between Claw Cape on the southeast and Reptile Promontory on the\r\nsouthwest. To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, shutting out more than\r\none-fourth of the horizon.\r\n\r\nBut Herbert, from his perch, could overlook the very portion of the\r\nisland which was giving, or had given, refuge to the strangers whose\r\npresence they suspected. The lad looked about him with great attention,\r\nfirst towards the sea, where not a sail was visible, although it was\r\npossible that a ship, and especially one dismasted, lying close in to\r\nshore, would be concealed from view by the trees which hid the coast.\r\nIn the woods of the Far West nothing could be seen. The forest formed a\r\nvast impenetrable dome many miles in extent, without an opening or\r\nglade. Even the course of the Mercy could not be seen, and it might be\r\nthat there were other streams flowing westward, which were equally\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nBut, other signs failing, could not the lad catch in the air some smoke\r\nthat would indicate the presence of man? The atmosphere was pure, and\r\nthe slightest vapor was sharply outlined against the sky. For an\r\ninstant Herbert thought he saw a thin film rising in the west, but a\r\nmore careful observation convinced him that he was mistaken. He looked\r\nagain, however, with all care, and his sight was excellent. No,\r\ncertainly, it was nothing.\r\n\r\nHerbert climbed down the tree, and he and the reporter returned to\r\nGranite House. There Smith listened to the lad’s report without\r\ncomment. It was plain he would not commit himself until after the\r\nisland had been explored.\r\n\r\nTwo days later—the 28th of October—another unaccountable incident\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nIn strolling along the beach, two miles from Granite House, Herbert and\r\nNeb had been lucky enough to capture a splendid specimen of the\r\nchelonia mydas (green turtle), whose carapace shone with emerald\r\nreflections. Herbert had caught sight of it moving among the rocks\r\ntowards the sea.\r\n\r\n“Stop him, Neb, stop him!” he cried.\r\n\r\nNeb ran to it.\r\n\r\n“It’s a fine animal,” said Neb, “but how are we going to keep it?”\r\n\r\n“That’s easy enough, Neb. All we have to do is to turn it on its back,\r\nand then it cannot get away. Take your spear and do as I do.”\r\n\r\nThe reptile had shut itself in its shell, so that neither its head nor\r\neyes were visible, and remained motionless as a rock. The lad and the\r\nnegro placed their spears underneath it, and, after some difficulty,\r\nsucceeded in turning it over. It measured three feet in length, and\r\nmust have weighed at least 400 pounds.\r\n\r\n“There, that will please Pencroff,” cried Neb.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the sailor could not fail to be pleased, as the flesh of these\r\nturtles, which feed upon eel-grass, is very savory.\r\n\r\n“And now what can we do with our game?” asked Neb; “we can’t carry it\r\nto Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“Leave it here, since it cannot turn back again,” answered Herbert,\r\n“and we will come for it with the cart.”\r\n\r\nNeb agreed, and Herbert, as an extra precaution, which the negro\r\nthought useless, propped up the reptile with large stones. Then the two\r\nreturned to Granite House, following the beach, on which the tide was\r\ndown. Herbert, wishing to surprise Pencroff, did not tell him of the\r\nprize which was lying on its back upon the sand; but two hours later\r\nNeb and he returned with the cart to where they had left it, and—the\r\n“splendid specimen of chelonia mydas” was not there!\r\n\r\nThe two looked about them. Certainly, this was where they had left it.\r\nHere were the stones he had used, and, therefore, the lad could not be\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n“Did the beast turn over, after all?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“It seems so,” replied Herbert, puzzled, and examining the stones\r\nscattered over the sand.\r\n\r\n“Pencroff will be disappointed.”\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Smith will be troubled to explain this!” thought Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Neb, who wished to conceal their misadventure, “we won’t\r\nsay anything about it.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, we will tell the whole story,” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\nAnd taking with them the useless cart, they returned to Granite House.\r\n\r\nAt the shipyard they found the engineer and the sailor working\r\ntogether. Herbert related all that happened.\r\n\r\n“You foolish fellows,” cried the sailor, “to let at least fifty pounds\r\nof soup, escape!”\r\n\r\n“But, Pencroff,” exclaimed Neb, “it was not our fault that the reptile\r\ngot away; haven’t I told you we turned it on its back?”\r\n\r\n“Then you didn’t turn it enough!” calmly asserted the stubborn sailor.\r\n\r\n“Not enough!” cried Herbert; and he told how he had taken care to prop\r\nthe turtle up with stones.\r\n\r\n“Then it was a miracle!” exclaimed Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” asked Herbert, “I thought that turtles once placed on\r\ntheir backs could not get over again, especially the very large ones?”\r\n\r\n“That is the fact,” answered Smith.\r\n\r\n“Then how did it—”\r\n\r\n“How far off from the sea did you leave this turtle,” asked the\r\nengineer, who had stopped working and was turning this incident over in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\n“About fifteen feet,” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“And it was low water?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” responded the engineer, “what the turtle could not do on land,\r\nhe could do in water. When the tide rose over him he turned over,\r\nand—tranquilly paddled off.”\r\n\r\n“How foolish we are,” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“That is just what I said you were,” answered Pencroff.\r\n\r\nSmith had given this explanation, which was doubtless admissible; but\r\nwas he himself satisfied with it? He did not venture to say that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF THE CANOE—A WRECK ON THE SHORE—THE TOW—JETSAM POINT—INVENTORY\r\nOF THE BOX—WHAT PENCROFF WANTED—A BIBLE—A VERSE FROM THE BIBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of October the canoe was finished. Pencroff had kept his\r\nword, and had built, in five days, a sort of bark shell, stiffened with\r\nflexible crejimba rods. A seat at either end, another midway to keep it\r\nopen, a gunwale for the thole-pins of a pair of oars, and a paddle to\r\nsteer with, completed this canoe, which was twelve feet in length, and\r\ndid not weigh 200 pounds.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried the sailor, quite ready to applaud his own success.\r\n“With this we can make the tour of—”\r\n\r\n“Of the world?” suggested Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No, but of the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast in the bow,\r\nwith a sail which Mr. Smith will make some day, and away we’ll go! But\r\nnow let us try our new ship, for we must see if it will carry all of\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThe experiment was made. Pencroff, by a stroke of the paddle, brought\r\nthe canoe close to the shore by a narrow passage between the rocks, and\r\nhe was confident that they could at once make a trial trip of the craft\r\nby following the bank as far as the lower point where the rocks ended.\r\n\r\nAs they were stepping in, Neb cried:—\r\n\r\n“But your boat leaks, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s nothing, Neb,” answered the sailor. “The wood has to drink!\r\nBut in two days it will not show, and there will be as little water in\r\nour canoe as in the stomach of a drunkard! Come, get in!”\r\n\r\nThey all embarked, and Pencroff pushed off. The weather was splendid,\r\nthe sea was as calm as a lake, and the canoe could venture upon it with\r\nas much security as upon the tranquil current of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nNeb and Herbert took the oars, and Pencroff sat in the stern with the\r\npaddle as steersman.\r\n\r\nThe sailor crossed the channel, and rounded the southern point of the\r\nislet. A gentle breeze was wafted from the south. There were no\r\nbillows, but the canoe rose and fell with the long undulations of the\r\nsea, and they rowed out half a mile from the coast so as to get a view\r\nof the outline of Mount Franklin. Then, putting about, Pencroff\r\nreturned towards the mouth of the river, and followed along the rounded\r\nshore which hid the low marshy ground of Tadorn’s Fen. The point, made\r\nlonger by the bend of the coast, was three miles from the Mercy, and\r\nthe colonists resolved to go past it far enough to obtain a hasty\r\nglance at the coast as far as Claw Cape.\r\n\r\nThe canoe followed along the shore, keeping off some two cables length\r\nso as to avoid the line of rocks beginning to be covered by the tide.\r\nThe cliff, beginning at the mouth of the river, lowered as it\r\napproached the promontory. It was a savage-looking, unevenly-arranged\r\nheap of granite blocks, very different from the curtain of Prospect\r\nPlateau. There was not a trace of vegetation on this sharp point, which\r\nprojected two miles beyond the forest, like a giant’s arm, thrust out\r\nfrom a green sleeve.\r\n\r\nThe canoe sped easily along. Spilett sketched the outline of the coast\r\nin his note-book, and Neb, Pencroff, and Herbert discussed the features\r\nof their new domain; and as they moved southward the two Mandible Capes\r\nseemed to shut together and enclose Union Bay. As to Smith, he regarded\r\neverything in silence, and from his distrustful expression it seemed as\r\nif he was observing some suspicious land.\r\n\r\nThe canoe had reached the end of the point and was about doubling it,\r\nwhen Herbert rose, and pointing out a black object, said:—\r\n\r\n“What is that down there on the sand?”\r\n\r\nEvery one looked in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\n“There is something there, indeed,” said the reporter. “It looks like a\r\nwreck half buried in the sand.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see what it is!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Barrels! they are barrels, and, may be, they are full!”\r\n\r\n“To shore, Pencroff!” said Smith.\r\n\r\nAnd with a few strokes the canoe was driven into a little cove, and the\r\nparty went up the beach.\r\n\r\nPencroff was not mistaken. There were two barrels half buried in the\r\nsand; but firmly fastened to them was a large box, which, borne up by\r\nthem, had been floated on to the shore.\r\n\r\n“Has there been a shipwreck here?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Evidently,” answered Spilett.\r\n\r\n“But what is in this box?” exclaimed Pencroff, with a natural\r\nimpatience. “What is in this box? It is closed, and we have nothing\r\nwith which to raise the lid. However, with a stone—”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor picked up a heavy rock, and was about to break one of\r\nthe sides, when the engineer, stopping him, said:—\r\n\r\n“Cannot you moderate your impatience for about an hour, Pencroff?”\r\n\r\n“But, think, Mr. Smith! May be there is everything we want in it!”\r\n\r\n“We will find out, Pencroff,” answered the engineer, “but do not break\r\nthe box, as it will be useful. Let us transport it to Granite House,\r\nwhere we can readily open it without injuring it. It is all prepared\r\nfor the voyage, and since it has floated here, it can float again to\r\nthe river month.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, sir, and I am wrong,” answered the sailor, “but one is\r\nnot always his own master!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s advice was good. It was likely that the canoe could not\r\ncarry the things probably enclosed in the box, since the latter was so\r\nheavy that it had to be buoyed up by two empty barrels. It was,\r\ntherefore, better to tow it in this condition to the shore at the\r\nGranite House.\r\n\r\nAnd now the important question was, from whence came this jetsam? Smith\r\nand his companions searched the beach for several hundred paces, but\r\nthere was nothing else to be seen. They scanned the sea, Herbert and\r\nNeb climbing up a high rock, but not a sail was visible on the horizon.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there must have been a shipwreck, and perhaps this\r\nincident was connected with the incident of the bullet. Perhaps the\r\nstrangers had landed upon another part of the island. Perhaps they were\r\nstill there. But the natural conclusion of the colonists was that these\r\nstrangers could not be Malay pirates, since the jetsam was evidently of\r\nEuropean or American production.\r\n\r\nThey all went back to the box, which measured five feet by three. It\r\nwas made of oak, covered with thick leather, studded with copper nails.\r\nThe two large barrels, hermetically sealed, but which sounded empty,\r\nwere fastened to its sides by means of strong ropes, tied in what\r\nPencroff recognized to be “sailor’s knots.” That it was uninjured\r\nseemed to be accounted for by the fact of its having been thrown upon\r\nthe sand instead of the rocks. And it was evident that it had not been\r\nlong either in the sea or upon the beach. It seemed probable, also,\r\nthat the water had not penetrated, and that its contents would be found\r\nuninjured. It therefore looked as if this box must have been thrown\r\noverboard from a disabled ship making for the island. And, in the hope\r\nthat it would reach the island, where they would find it later, the\r\npassengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up.\r\n\r\n“We will tow this box to Granite House,” said the engineer, “and take\r\nan inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the survivors\r\nof this supposed shipwreck, we will return them what is theirs. If we\r\nfind no one—”\r\n\r\n“We will keep the things ourselves!” cried the sailor. “But I wish I\r\nknew what is in it.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor was already working at the prize, which would doubtless\r\nfloat at high water. One of the ropes which was fastened to the barrels\r\nwas partly untwisted and served to fasten these latter to the canoe.\r\nThen, Neb and Pencroff dug out the sand with their oars, and soon the\r\ncanoe, with the jetsam in tow, was rounding the promontory to which\r\nthey gave the name of Jetsam Point. The box was so heavy that the\r\nbarrels just sufficed to sustain it above the water; and Pencroff\r\nfeared each moment that it would break loose and sink to the bottom.\r\nFortunately his fears were groundless, and in an hour and a half the\r\ncanoe touched the bank before Granite House.\r\n\r\nThe boat and the prize were drawn upon the shore, and as the tide was\r\nbeginning to fall, both soon rested on dry ground. Neb brought some\r\ntools so as to open the box without injury, and the colonists forthwith\r\nproceeded to examine its contents.\r\n\r\nPencroff did not try to hide his anxiety. He began by unfastening the\r\nbarrels, which would be useful in the future, then the fastenings were\r\nforced with pincers, and the cover taken off. A second envelope, of\r\nzinc, was enclosed within the case, in such a manner that its contents\r\nwere impervious to moisture.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Pencroff, “they must be preserves which are inside.”\r\n\r\n“I hope for something better than that,” answered the reporter.\r\n\r\n“If it should turn out that there was—” muttered the sailor.\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Nothing!”\r\n\r\nThe zinc cover was split, lengthwise and turned back, and, little by\r\nlittle, many different objects were lifted out on the sand. At each new\r\ndiscovery Pencroff cheered, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced.\r\nThere were books which made the lad crazy with pleasure, and cooking\r\nimplements which Neb covered with kisses.\r\n\r\nIn truth the colonists had reason to be satisfied, as the following\r\ninventory, copied from Spilett’s note-book, will show:—\r\n\r\nTOOLS.—3 pocket-knives, with-several blades, 2 wood-chopper’s hatchets,\r\n2 carpenter’s hatchets, 3 planes, I adzes, l axe, 6 cold chisels, 2\r\nfiles, 3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3\r\nsaws of different sizes, 2 boxes of needles.\r\n\r\nARMS.—2 flint-lock guns, 2 percussion guns, 2 central-fire carbines; 5\r\ncutlasses, 4 boarding sabres, 2 barrels of powder, holding l5 pounds\r\neach, l2 boxes of caps.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS.—1 sextant, 1 opera-glass, 1 spyglass, 1 box compass, 1\r\npocket compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer, 1 aneroid barometer, 1 box\r\ncontaining a photographic apparatus, together with glasses, chemicals,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nCLOTHING.—2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, though\r\nevidently a vegetable substance; 3 dozen stockings of the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nUTENSILS.—1 Iron pot, 6 tinned copper stewpans, 3 iron plates, 10\r\naluminium knives and forks, 2 kettles, 1 small portable stove. 5 table\r\nknives.\r\n\r\nBOOKS.-l Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of Polynesian languages, 1\r\ndictionary of the Natural Sciences, 3 reams of blank paper, 2 blank\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n“Unquestionably,” said the reporter, after the inventory had been\r\ntaken, “the owner of this box was a practical man! Tools, arms,\r\ninstruments, clothing, utensils, books, nothing is wanting. One would\r\nsay that he had made ready for a shipwreck before-hand!”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Indeed, is wanting,” murmured Smith, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“And it is a sure thing,” added Herbert, “that the ship that brought\r\nthis box was not a Malay pirate!”\r\n\r\n“Unless its owner had been taken prisoner,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“That is not likely,” answered the reporter. “It is more probable that\r\nan American or European ship has been driven to this neighborhood, and\r\nthat the passengers, wishing to save what was, at least, necessary,\r\nhave prepared this box and have thrown it overboard.”\r\n\r\n“And do you think so, Mr. Smith?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy,” answered the engineer, “that might have been the case.\r\nIt is possible, that, anticipating a ship wreck, this chest has been\r\nprepared, so that it might be found again on the coast—”\r\n\r\n“But the photographic apparatus!” observed the sailor incredulously.\r\n\r\n“As to that,” answered the engineer, “I do not see its use; what we, as\r\nwell as any other ship wrecked person, would have valued more, would\r\nhave been a greater assortment of clothing and more ammunition!”\r\n\r\n“But have none of these things any mark by which we can tell where they\r\ncame from,” askedSpilett.\r\n\r\nThey looked to see. Each article was examined attentively, but,\r\ncontrary to custom, neither books, instruments, nor arms had any name\r\nor mark; nevertheless, they were in perfect order, and seemed never to\r\nhave been used. So also with the tools and utensils; everything was\r\nnew, and this went to prove that the things had not been hastily thrown\r\ntogether in the box, but that their selection had been made\r\nthoughtfully and with care. This, also, was evident from the zinc case\r\nwhich had kept everything watertight, and which could not have been\r\nsoldered in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe two dictionaries and the Bible were in English, and the latter\r\nshowed that it had been often read. The Atlas was a splendid work,\r\ncontaining maps of every part of the world, and many charts laid out on\r\nMercator’s Projection. The nomenclature in this book was in French, but\r\nneither in it, nor in any of the others, did the name of the editor or\r\npublisher appear.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, therefore, were unable to even conjecture the\r\nnationality of the ship that had so recently passed near them. But no\r\nmatter where it came from, this box enriched the party on Lincoln\r\nIsland. Until now, in transforming the products of nature, they had\r\ncreated everything for themselves, and had succeeded by their own\r\nintelligence. Did it not now seem as if Providence had intended to\r\nreward them by placing these divers products of human industry in their\r\nhands? Therefore, with one accord, they all rendered thanks to Heaven.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Pencroff was not entirely satisfied. It appeared that the\r\nbox did not contain something to which he attached an immense\r\nimportance, and as its contests lessened, his cheers had become less\r\nhearty, and when the inventory was closed, he murmured:—\r\n\r\n“That’s all very fine, but you see there is nothing for me here!”\r\n\r\n“Why, what did you expect, Pencroff?” exclaimed Neb.\r\n\r\n“A half pound of tobacco,” answered the sailor, “and then I would have\r\nbeen perfectly happy!”\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this jetsam made the thorough exploration of the\r\nisland more necessary than ever. It was, therefore, agreed that they\r\nshould set out early the next morning, proceeding to the western coast\r\nvia the Mercy. If anyone had been shipwrecked on that part of the\r\nisland, they were doubtless without resources, and help must be given\r\nthem at once.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the contents of the box were carried to Granite House\r\nand arranged in order in the great hall. And that evening—the 29th of\r\nOctober—Herbert before retiring asked Mr. Smith to read some passages\r\nfrom the Bible.\r\n\r\n“Gladly,” answered the engineer, taking the sacred book in his hands;\r\nwhen Pencroff checking him, said:—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith, I am superstitious. Open the book at random and read the\r\nfirst verse which you meet with. We will see if it applies to our\r\nsituation.”\r\n\r\nSmith smiled at the words of the sailor, but yielding to his wishes he\r\nopened the Bible where the marker lay between the leaves. Instantly his\r\neye fell upon a red cross made with a crayon, opposite the 8th verse of\r\nthe seventh chapter of St. Matthew.\r\n\r\nHe read these words:—\r\n\r\n“For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTURE—THE RISING TIDE—ELMS AND OTHER TREES—DIFFERENT PLANTS—THE\r\nKINGFISHER—APPEARANCE OF THE FOREST—THE GIGANTIC EUCALYPTI—WHY THEY ARE\r\nCALLED FEVER-TREES—MONKEYS—THE WATERFALL—ENCAMPMENT FOR THE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day—the 30th of October—everything was prepared for the\r\nproposed exploration, which these last events had made so necessary.\r\nIndeed, as things had turned out, the colonists could well imagine\r\nthemselves in a condition to give, rather than to receive, help.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that they ascend the Mercy as far as practicable. They\r\nwould thus be able to transport their arms and provisions a good part\r\nof the way without fatigue.\r\n\r\nIt was also necessary to think, not only of what they now carried, but\r\nof what they might perhaps bring back to Granite House. If, as all\r\nthought, there had been a shipwreck on the coast, they would find many\r\nthings they wanted on the shore, and the cart would doubtless have\r\nproved more convenient than the canoe. But the cart was so heavy and\r\nunwieldy that it would have been too hard work to drag it, which fact\r\nmade Pencroff regret that the box had not only held his half-pound of\r\ntobacco, but also a pair of stout New Jersey horses, which would have\r\nbeen so useful to the colony.\r\n\r\nThe provisions, already packed by Neb, consisted of enough dried meat,\r\nbeer, and fermented liquor to last them for the three days which Smith\r\nexpected they would be absent. Moreover, they counted on being able to\r\nreplenish their stock at need along the route, and Neb had taken care\r\nnot to forget the portable stove.\r\n\r\nThey took the two wood-choppers’ hatchets to aid in making their way\r\nthrough the thick forest, and also the glass and the pocket compass.\r\n\r\nOf the arms, they chose the two flint-lock guns in preference to the\r\nothers, as the colonists could always renew the flints; whereas the\r\ncaps could not be replaced. Nevertheless, they took one of the carbines\r\nand some cartridges. As for the powder, the barrels held fifty pounds,\r\nand it was necessary to take a certain amount of that; but the engineer\r\nexpected to manufacture an explosive substance, by which it could be\r\nsaved in the future. To the firearms they added the five cutlasses, in\r\nleather scabbards. And thus equipped, the party could venture into the\r\nforest with some chance of success.\r\n\r\nArmed in this manner, Pencroff, Herbert, and Neb had all they could\r\ndesire, although Smith made them promise not to fire a shot\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\nAt 6 o’clock the party, accompanied by Top, started for the mouth of\r\nthe Mercy. The tide had been rising half an hour, and there were\r\ntherefore some hours yet of the flood which they could make use of. The\r\ncurrent was strong, and they did not need to row to pass rapidly up\r\nbetween the high banks and the river. In a few minutes the explorers\r\nhad reached the turn where, seven months before, Pencroff had made his\r\nfirst raft. Having passed this elbow, the river, flowing from the\r\nsouthwest, widened out under the shadow of the grand ever-green\r\nconifers; and Smith and his companions could not but admire the\r\nbeautiful scenery. As they advanced the species of forest trees\r\nchanged. On the right bank rose splendid specimens of ulmaceæ, those\r\nvaluable elms so much sought after by builders, which have the property\r\nof remaining sound for a long time in water. There was, also, numerous\r\ngroups belonging to the same family, among them the micocouliers, the\r\nroot of which produces a useful oil. Herbert discovered some\r\nlardizabalaceæ, whose flexible branches, soaked in water, furnish\r\nexcellent ropes, and two or three trunks of ebony of a beautiful black\r\ncolor, curiously veined.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, where a landing was easy, the canoe stopped, and\r\nSpilett, Herbert, and Pencroff, accompanied by Top, explored the bank.\r\nIn addition to the game, Herbert thought that he might meet with some\r\nuseful little plant which was not to be despised, and the young\r\nnaturalist was rewarded by discovering a sort of wild spinach and\r\nnumerous specimens of the genus cabbage, which would, doubtless, bear\r\ntransplanting; they were cresses, horse-radishes, and a little,\r\nvelvety, spreading plant, three-feet high, bearing brownish-colored\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what this is?” asked Herbert of the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Tobacco!” cried Pencroff, who had evidently never seen the plant which\r\nhe fancied so much.\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff,” answered Herbert, “It is not tobacco, it is mustard.”\r\n\r\n“Only mustard!” exclaimed the other. “Well if you happen to come across\r\na tobacco plant, my boy, do not pass it by.”\r\n\r\n“We will find it someday,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“All right,” cried Pencroff, “and then I will be able to say that the\r\nisland lacks nothing!”\r\n\r\nThese plants were taken up carefully and carried back to the canoe,\r\nwhere Cyrus Smith had remained absorbed in his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe reporter, Herbert, and Pencroff, made many of these excursions,\r\nsometimes on the right bank of the Mercy and sometimes upon the left.\r\nThe latter was less abrupt, but more wooded. The engineer found, by\r\nreference to the pocket-compass, that the general direction of the\r\nriver from its bend was southwest, and that it was nearly straight for\r\nabout three miles. But it was probable that the direction would change\r\nfurther up, and that it would flow from the spurs of Mount Franklin,\r\nwhich fed its waters in the northwest.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these excursions Spilett caught a couple of birds with\r\nlong, slim beaks, slender necks, short wings, and no tails, which\r\nHerbert called tinamous, and which they resolved should be the first\r\noccupants of the future poultry-yard.\r\n\r\nBut the first report of a gun that echoed through the forests of the\r\nFar West, was provoked by the sight of a beautiful bird, resembling a\r\nkingfisher.\r\n\r\n“I know it,” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“What do you know?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“That bird! It is the bird which escaped on our first exploration, the\r\none after which we named this part of the forest!”\r\n\r\n“A jacamar!” exclaimed Herbert.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, one of those beautiful birds, whose harsh plumage is\r\ncovered with a metallic lustre. Some small shot dropped it to the\r\nearth, and Top brought it, and also some touracolories, climbing birds,\r\nthe size of pigeons, to the canoe. The honor of this first shot\r\nbelonged to the lad, who was pleased enough with the result. The\r\ntouracolories were better game than the jacamar, the flash of the\r\nlatter being tough, but it would have been hard to persuade Pencroff\r\nthat they had not killed the most delicious of birds.\r\n\r\nIt was 10 o’clock when the canoe reached the second bend of the river,\r\nsome five miles from the mouth. Here they stopped half an hour, under\r\nthe shadow of the trees, for breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe river measured from sixty to seventy feet in width, and was five or\r\nsix feet deep. The engineer had remarked its several affluents, but\r\nthey were simply unnavigable streams. The Forests of the Far West, or\r\nJacamar Wood, extended farther than they could see, but no where could\r\nthey detect the presence of man. If, therefore, any persons had been\r\nshipwrecked on the island, they had not yet quitted the shore, and it\r\nwas not in those thick coverts that search must be made for the\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\nThe engineer began to manifest some anxiety to get to the western coast\r\nof the island, distant, as he calculated, about five miles or less. The\r\njourney was resumed, and, although the course of the Mercy, sometimes\r\ntowards the shore, was oftener towards the mountain, it was thought\r\nbetter to follow it as long as possible, on account of the fatigue and\r\nloss of time incident to hewing a way through the wood. Soon, the tide\r\nhaving attained its height, Herbert and Neb took the oars, and Pencroff\r\nthe paddle, wad they continued the ascent by rowing.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the forest of the Far West began to grow thinner. But,\r\nas the trees grew farther apart, they profited by the increased space,\r\nand attained a splendid growth.\r\n\r\n“Eucalypti!” cried Herbert, descrying some of these superb plants, the\r\nloftiest giants of the extra-tropical zone, the congeners of the\r\neucalypti of Australia and New Zealand, both of which countries were\r\nsituated in the same latitude as Lincoln Island. Some rose 200 feet in\r\nheight and measured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark, five\r\nfingers in thickness, exuded an aromatic resin. Equally wonderful were\r\nthe enormous specimens of myrtle, their leaves extending edgewise to\r\nthe sun, and permitting its rays to penetrate and fall upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“What trees!” exclaimed Neb. “Are they good for anything?”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” answered Pencroff. “They are like overgrown men, good for\r\nnothing but to show in fairs!”\r\n\r\n“I think you’re wrong, Pencroff,” said Spilett, “the eucalyptus wood is\r\nbeginning to be extensively used in cabinet work.”\r\n\r\n“And I am sure,” added Herbert, “that it belongs to a most useful\r\nfamily,” and thereupon the young naturalist enumerated many species of\r\nthe plant and their uses.\r\n\r\nEvery one listened to the lad’s lesson in botany, Smith smiling,\r\nPencroff with an indescribable pride. “That’s all very well, Herbert,”\r\nanswered the sailor, “but I dare swear that of all these useful\r\nspecimens none are as large as these!”\r\n\r\n“That is so.”\r\n\r\n“Then, that proves what I said,” replied the sailor, “that giants are\r\ngood for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“There’s where you are wrong, Pencroff,” said the engineer, “these very\r\neucalypti are good for something.”\r\n\r\n“For what?”\r\n\r\n“To render the country healthy about them. Do you know what they call\r\nthem In Australia and New Zealand?”\r\n\r\n“No sir.”\r\n\r\n“They call them ‘fever’ trees.”\r\n\r\n“Because they give it?”\r\n\r\n“No; because they prevent it!”\r\n\r\n“Good. I shall make a note of that,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Note then, my dear Spilett, that it has been proved that the presence\r\nof these trees neutralizes marsh miasmas. They have tried this natural\r\nremedy in certain unhealthy parts of Europe, and northern Africa, with\r\nthe best results. And there are no intermittent fevers in the region of\r\nthese forests, which is a fortunate thing for us colonists of Lincoln\r\nIsland.”\r\n\r\n“What a blessed island!” cried Pencroff. “It would lack nothing—if it\r\nwas not—”\r\n\r\n“That will come, Pencroff, we will find it,” answered the reporter;\r\n“but now let us attend to our work and push on as far as we can get\r\nwith the canoe.”\r\n\r\nThey continued on through the woods two miles further, the river\r\nbecoming more winding, shallow, and so narrow that Pencroff pushed\r\nalong with a pole. The sun was setting, and, as it would be impossible\r\nto pass in the darkness through the five or six miles of unknown woods\r\nwhich the engineer estimated lay between them and the coast, it was\r\ndetermined to camp wherever the canoe was obliged to stop.\r\n\r\nThey now pushed on without delay through the forest, which grew more\r\ndense, and seemed more inhabited, because, if the sailor’s eyes did not\r\ndeceive him, he perceived troops of monkeys running among the\r\nunderbrush. Sometimes, two or three of these animals would halt at a\r\ndistance from the canoe and regard its occupants, as if, seeing men for\r\nthe first time, they had not then learned to fear them. It would have\r\nbeen easy to have shot some of these quadrumanes, but Smith was opposed\r\nto the useless slaughter. Pencroff, however, looked upon the monkey\r\nfrom a gastronomic point of view, and, indeed, as these animals are\r\nentirely herberiferous, they make excellent game; but since provisions\r\nabounded, it was useless to waste the ammunition.\r\n\r\nTowards 4 o’clock the navigation of the Mercy became very difficult,\r\nits course being obstructed by rocks and aquatic plants. The banks rose\r\nhigher and higher, and, already, the bed of the stream was confined\r\nbetween the outer spurs of Mount Franklin. Its sources could not be far\r\noff, since the waters were fed by the southern watershed of that\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n“Before a quarter of an hour we will have to stop, sir,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, we will make a camp for the night.”\r\n\r\n“How far are we from Granite House?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“About seven miles, counting the bends of the river, which have taken\r\nus to the northwest.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we keep on?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, as far as we can get,” answered the engineer. “To-morrow, at\r\ndaylight, we will leave the canoe, and traverse, in two hours I hope,\r\nthe distance which separates us from the coast, and then we will have\r\nnearly the whole day in which to explore the shore.”\r\n\r\n“Push on,” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\nVery soon the canoe grated on the stones at the bottom of the river,\r\nwhich was not more than twenty feet wide. A thick mass of verdure\r\noverhung and descended the stream, and they heard the noise of a\r\nwaterfall, which indicated that some little distance further on there\r\nexisted a natural barrier.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, at the last turn in the river, they saw the cascade\r\nshining through the trees. The canoe scraped over the bottom and then\r\ngrounded on a rock near the right bank.\r\n\r\nIt was 5 o’clock, and the level rays of the setting sun illuminated the\r\nlittle fall. Above, the Mercy, supplied from a secret source, was\r\nhidden by the bushes. The various streams together had made it a river,\r\nbut here it was but a shallow, limpid brook.\r\n\r\nThey made camp in this lovely spot. Having disembarked, a fire was\r\nlighted under a group of micocouliers, in whose branches Smith and his\r\ncompanions could, if need be, find a refuge for the night.\r\n\r\nSupper was soon finished, as they were very hungry, and then there was\r\nnothing to do but to go to sleep. But some suspicious growling being\r\nheard at nightfall, the fire was so arranged as to protect the sleepers\r\nby its flames. Neb and Pencroff kept it lit, and perhaps they were not\r\nmistaken in believing to have seen some moving shadows among the trees\r\nand bushes; but the night passed without accident, and the next day—the\r\n31st of October—by 5 o’clock all were on foot ready for the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOING TOWARD THE COAST—TROOPS OF MONKEYS—A NEW WATER-COURSE—WHY THE\r\nTIDE WAS NOT FELT—A FOREST ON THE SHORE—REPTILE PROMONTORY—SPILETT\r\nMAKES HERBERT ENVIOUS—THE BAMBOO FUSILADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was 6 o’clock when the colonists, after an early breakfast, started\r\nwith the intention of reaching the coast by the shortest route. Smith\r\nhad estimated that it would take them two hours, but it must depend\r\nlargely on the nature of the obstacles in the way. This part of the Far\r\nWest was covered with trees, like an immense thicket composed of many\r\ndifferent species. It was, therefore, probable that they would have to\r\nmake a way with hatchets in hand—and guns also, if they were to judge\r\nfrom the cries heard over night.\r\n\r\nThe exact position of the camp had been determined by the situation of\r\nMount Franklin, and since the volcano rose less than three miles to the\r\nnorth, it was only necessary to go directly toward the southwest to\r\nreach the west coast.\r\n\r\nAfter having seen to the mooring of the canoe, the party started, Neb\r\nand Pencroff carrying sufficient provisions to last the little troop\r\nfor two days at least. They were no longer hunting, and the engineer\r\nrecommended his companions to refrain from unnecessary firing, so as\r\nnot to give warning of their presence on the coast. The first blows of\r\nthe hatchet were given in the bushes just above the cascade, while\r\nSmith, compass in hand, indicated the route. The forest was, for the\r\nmost part, composed of such trees as had already been recognized about\r\nthe lake and on Prospect Plateau. The colonists could advance but\r\nslowly, and the engineer believed that in time their route would join\r\nwith that of Red Creek.\r\n\r\nSince their departure, the party had descended the low declivities\r\nwhich constituted the orography of the island, over a very dry\r\ndistrict, although the luxuriant vegetation suggested either a\r\nhydrographic network permeating the ground beneath, or the proximity to\r\nsome stream. Nevertheless, Smith did not remember having seen, during\r\nthe excursion to the crater, any other water courses than Bed Creek and\r\nthe Mercy.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few hours of the march, they saw troops of monkeys,\r\nwho manifested the greatest astonishment at the sight of human beings.\r\nSpilett laughingly asked if these robust quadrumanes did not look upon\r\ntheir party as degenerate brethren; and, in truth, the simple\r\npedestrians, impeded at each step by the bushes, entangled in the\r\nlianas, stopped by tree trunks, did not compare favorably with these\r\nnimble animals, which bounded from branch to branch, moving about\r\nwithout hindrance. These monkeys were very numerous, but, fortunately,\r\nthey did not manifest any hostile disposition.\r\n\r\nThey saw, also, some wild-boars, some agoutis, kangaroos, and other\r\nrodents, and two or three koulas, which latter Pencroff would have been\r\nglad to shoot.\r\n\r\n“But,” said he, “the hunt has not begun. Play now, my friends, and we\r\nwill talk to you when we come back.”\r\n\r\nAt half-past 9, the route, which bore directly southwest, was suddenly\r\ninterrupted by a rapid stream, rushing over rocks, and pent in between\r\nbanks but thirty or forty feet apart. It was deep and clear, but\r\nabsolutely unnavigable.\r\n\r\n“We are stopped!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Herbert; “we can swim such a brook as this.”\r\n\r\n“Why should we do that?” answered Smith. “It is certain that this creek\r\nempties into the sea. Let us keep to this bank and I will be astonished\r\nif it does not soon bring us to the coast. Come on!”\r\n\r\n“One minute,” said the reporter. “The name of this creek, my friends?\r\nWe must not leave our geography incomplete.”\r\n\r\n“True enough,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“You name it, my boy,” said the engineer, addressing Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Will not it be better to wait till we have discovered its mouth?”\r\nasked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Right,” replied Smith, “let us push on.”\r\n\r\n“Another minute,” exclaimed Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“What more?” demanded the reporter.\r\n\r\n“If hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,” said the\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t the time to waste,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But just five minutes,” pleaded Pencroff; “I only want five minutes\r\nfor the sake of breakfast!” And lying down on the bank he plunged his\r\narms in the running waters and soon brought up several dozen of the\r\nfine crawfish which swarmed between the rocks.\r\n\r\n“These will be good!” cried Neb, helping the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Did not I tell you that the island had everything but tobacco?” sighed\r\nthe sailor.\r\n\r\nIt took but five minutes to fill a sack with these little blue\r\ncrustaceæ, and then the journey was resumed.\r\n\r\nBy following the bank the colonists moved more freely. Now and then\r\nthey found traces of large animals which came to the stream for water,\r\nbut they found no sign of human beings, and they were not yet in that\r\npart of the Far West where the peccary had received the leaden pellet\r\nwhich cost Pencroff a tooth.\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions judged, from the fact that the current rushed\r\ntowards the sea with such rapidity, that they must be much farther\r\nfrom, the coast than they imagined, because at this time the tide was\r\nrising, and its’ effect would have been visible near the mouth of the\r\ncreek. The engineer was greatly astonished, and often consulted his\r\ncompass to be sure that the stream, was not returning towards the\r\ndepths of the forest. Meantime, its waters, gradually widening, became\r\nless tumultuous. The growth of trees on the right bank was much denser\r\nthan on the left, and it was impossible to see through this thicket;\r\nbut these woods were certainly not inhabited, or Top would have\r\ndiscovered it. At half-past 10, to the extreme surprise of Smith,\r\nHerbert, who was walking some paces ahead, suddenly stopped,\r\nexclaiming, “The sea!”\r\n\r\nAnd a few minutes later the colonists, standing upon the border of the\r\nforest, saw the western coast of the island spread before them.\r\n\r\nBut what a contrast was this coast to the one on which chance had\r\nthrown them! No granite wall, no reef in the offing, not even a beach.\r\nThe forest formed the shore, and its furthermost trees, washed by the\r\nwaves, leaned over the waters. It was in no sense such a beach as is\r\nusually met with, composed of vast reaches of sand or heaps of rocks,\r\nbut a fine border of beautiful trees. The bank was raised above the\r\nhighest tides, and upon this rich soil, supported by a granite base,\r\nthe splendid monarchs of the forest seemed to be as firmly set as were\r\nthose which stood in the interior of the island.\r\n\r\nThe colonists stood in a hollow by a tiny rivulet, which served as a\r\nneck to the other stream; but, curiously enough, these waters, instead\r\nof emptying into the sea by a gently sloping opening, fell from a\r\nheight of more than forty feet—which fact explained why the rising tide\r\ndid not affect the current. And, on this account, they were unanimous\r\nin giving this water-course the name of Fall River.\r\n\r\nBeyond, towards the north, the forest shore extended for two miles;\r\nthen the trees became thinner, and, still further on, a line of\r\npicturesque heights extended from north to south. On the other hand,\r\nall that part of the coast comprised between Fall River and the\r\npromontory of Reptile End was bordered by masses of magnificent trees,\r\nsome upright and others leaning over the sea, whose waves lapped their\r\nroots. It was evidently, therefore, on this part of the coast that the\r\nexploration must be continued, as this shore offered to the castaways,\r\nwhoever they might be, a refuge, which the other, desert and savage,\r\nhad refused.\r\n\r\nThe weather was beautiful, and from the cliff where the breakfast had\r\nbeen prepared, the view extended far and wide. The horizon was\r\nperfectly distinct, without a sail in sight, and upon the coast, as far\r\nas could be seen, there was neither boat nor wreck, but the engineer\r\nwas not willing to be satisfied in this respect, until they had\r\nexplored the whole distance as far as Serpentine Peninsula.\r\n\r\nAfter a hurried breakfast he gave the signal to start. Instead of\r\ntraversing a beach, the colonists followed along the coast, under the\r\ntrees. The distance to Reptile End was about twelve miles, and, had the\r\nway been clear, they could have accomplished it in four hours, but the\r\nparty were constantly obliged to turn out from the way, or to cut\r\nbranches, or to break through thickets, and these hindrances multiplied\r\nas they proceeded. But they saw no signs of a recent shipwreck on the\r\nshore; although, as Spilett observed, as the tide was up, they could\r\nnot say with certainty that there had not been one.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning was just, and, moreover, the incident of the bullet\r\nproved, indubitably, that within three months a gun had been fired on\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nAt 5 o’clock the extremity of the peninsula was still two miles\r\ndistant, and it was evident that the colonists would have to camp for\r\nthe night on the promontory of Reptile End. Happily, game was as plenty\r\nhere as on the other coast, and birds of different kinds abounded. Two\r\nhours later, the party, tired out, reached the promontory. Here the\r\nforest border ended, and the shore assumed the usual aspect of a coast.\r\nIt was possible that an abandoned vessel might be here, but, as the\r\nnight was falling, it was necessary to postpone the exploration until\r\nthe morrow.\r\n\r\nPencroff and Herbert hastened to find a suitable place for a camp. The\r\noutskirts of the forest died away here, and near them the lad found a\r\nbamboo thicket.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said he, “this is a valuable discovery.”\r\n\r\n“Valuable?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, I need not tell you, Pencroff, all its uses, such as for\r\nmaking baskets, paper, and water-pipes; that the larger ones make\r\nexcellent building material and strong jars. But—”\r\n\r\n“But?”\r\n\r\n“But perhaps you do not know that in India they eat bamboo as we do\r\nasparagus.”\r\n\r\n“Asparagus thirty feet high?” cried, Pencroff. “And is it good?”\r\n\r\n“Excellent,” answered the lad. “But they eat only the young sprouts.”\r\n\r\n“Delicious!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“And I am sure that the pith of young plants preserved in vinegar makes\r\nan excellent condiment.”\r\n\r\n“Better and better.”\r\n\r\n“And, lastly, they exude a sweet liquor which makes a pleasant drink.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” demanded the sailor.\r\n\r\n“That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it good to smoke?”\r\n\r\n“No, my poor Pencroff, you cannot smoke it!”\r\n\r\nThey did not have to search far for a good place for the camp. The\r\nrocks, much worn by the action of the sea, had many hollows that would\r\nafford shelter from the wind. But just as they were about to enter one\r\nof these cavities they were arrested by formidable growlings.\r\n\r\n“Get back!” cried Pencroff, “we have only small shot in our guns, and\r\nthese beasts would mind it no more than salt!”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor, seizing Herbert, dragged him behind some rocks, just as\r\na huge jaguar appeared at the mouth of the cavern. Its skin was yellow,\r\nstriped with black, and softened off with white under its belly. The\r\nbeast advanced, and looked about. Its hair was bristling, and its eyes\r\nsparkling as if it was not scenting man for the first time.\r\n\r\nJust then Spilett appeared, coming round the high rocks, and Herbert,\r\nthinking he had not seen the jaguar, was about rushing towards him,\r\nwhen the reporter, motioning with his hand, continued his approach. It\r\nwas not his first tiger.\r\n\r\nAdvancing within ten paces of the animal, he rested motionless, his gun\r\nat his shoulder, not a muscle quivering. The jaguar, crouching back,\r\nmade a bound towards the hunter, but as it sprung a bullet struck it\r\nbetween the eyes, dropping it dead.\r\n\r\nHerbert and Pencroff rushed to it, and Smith and Neb coming up at the\r\nmoment, all stopped to look at the splendid animal lying at length upon\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I envy you!” cried Herbert, in an excess of\r\nnatural enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy, you would have done as well,” answered the reporter.\r\n\r\n“I have been as cool as that!”\r\n\r\n“Only imagine, Herbert, that a jaguar is a hare, and you will shoot him\r\nas unconcernedly as anything in the world! And now,” continued the\r\nreporter, “since the jaguar has left his retreat I don’t see, my\r\nfriends, why we should not occupy the place during the night”\r\n\r\n“But some others may return!” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“We will only have to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern,” said\r\nthe reporter, “and they will not dare to cross the threshold.”\r\n\r\n“To the jaguar house, then,” cried the sailor, dragging the body of the\r\nanimal after him.\r\n\r\nThe colonists went to the abandoned cave, and, while Neb was occupied\r\nin skinning the carcass, the others busied themselves with piling a\r\ngreat quantity of dry wood around the threshold. This done they\r\ninstalled themselves in the cave, whose floor was strewn with bones;\r\nthe arms were loaded for an emergency; and, having eaten supper, as\r\nsoon as the time for sleep was come, the fire at the entrance was lit.\r\n\r\nImmediately a tremendous fusilade ensued! It was the bamboo which, in\r\nburning, exploded like fire-works! The noise, in itself, would have\r\nbeen sufficient to frighten off the bravest beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL TO RETURN BY THE SOUTH COAST—ITS CONFIGURATION—SEARCH FOR THE\r\nSHIPWRECKED—A WAIF IN THE AIR—DISCOVERY OF A SMALL NATURAL\r\nHARBOR—MIDNIGHT ON THE MERCY—A DRIFTING CANOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions slept like mice in the cavern which the jaguar\r\nhad so politely vacated, and, by sunrise, all were on the extremity of\r\nthe promontory, and scrutinizing the horizon visible on either hand. No\r\nship or wreck was to be seen, and not even with the spy-glass could any\r\nsuspicious object be discerned. It was the same along the shore, at\r\nleast on all that portion, three miles in length, which formed the\r\nsouth side of the promontory; as, beyond that, a slope of the land\r\nconcealed the rest of the coast, and even from the extremity of\r\nSerpentine Peninsula, Claw Cape was hidden by high rocks.\r\n\r\nThe southern bank of the island remained to be explored. Had they not\r\nbetter attempt this at once, and give up this day to it? This procedure\r\nhad not entered into their first calculations, as, when the canoe was\r\nleft at the sources of the Mercy, the colonists thought that, having\r\nexplored the west coast, they would return by the river; Smith having\r\nthen believed that this coast sheltered either a wreck or a passing\r\nship. But as soon as this shore disclosed no landing place, it became\r\nnecessary to search the south side of the island for those whom they\r\nhad failed to discover on the west.\r\n\r\nIt was Spilett who proposed continuing the exploration so as to settle\r\ndefinitely the question of the supposed shipwreck, and he inquired how\r\nfar it would be to Claw Cape.\r\n\r\n“About thirty miles,” answered the engineer, “if we allow for the\r\nirregularity of the shore.”\r\n\r\n“Thirty miles!” exclaimed Spilett, “that would be a long walk.\r\nNevertheless, I think we should return to Granite House by the south\r\ncoast.”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Herbert, “from Claw Cape to Granite House is at least\r\nten miles further.”\r\n\r\n“Call it forty miles altogether,” answered the reporter, “and do not\r\nlet us hesitate to do it. At least we will have seen this unknown\r\nshore, and will not have it to explore over again.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said Pencroff. “But how about the canoe?”\r\n\r\n“The canoe can stay where it is for a day or two,” replied Spilett. “We\r\ncan hardly say that the island is infested with thieves!” ‘\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, when I remember that affair of the turtle, I am not so\r\nconfident.”\r\n\r\n“The turtle! the turtle!” cried the reporter, “don’t you know that the\r\nsea turned it over?”\r\n\r\n“Who can say?” murmured the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But—,” began Neb, who, it was evident, wished to say something.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Neb?” questioned the engineer.\r\n\r\n“If we do return by the shore to Claw Cape, after having gone round it,\r\nwe will be stopped—”\r\n\r\n“By the Mercy!” cried Herbert. “And we have no bridge or boat!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” answered Pencroff, “we can cross it readily enough with some\r\nlogs.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said Spilett, “it would be well to build a bridge some\r\ntime if we wish to have ready access to the Far West.”\r\n\r\n“A bridge!” cried Pencroff. “Well isn’t Mr. Smith State Engineer? If we\r\nshall need a bridge we will have one. As to carrying you over the Mercy\r\nto-night without getting wet, I will look out for that. We still have a\r\nday’s provision, which is all that is necessary, and, besides, the game\r\nmay not give out to-day as It did yesterday. So let us go.”\r\n\r\nThe proposal of the reporter, strongly seconded by the sailor, obtained\r\ngeneral approval, as every one wished to end their doubts, and by\r\nreturning by Claw Cape the exploration would be complete. But no time\r\nwas to be lost, for the tramp was long, and they counted on reaching\r\nGranite House that night. So by 6 o’clock the little party was on its\r\nway, the guns loaded with ball in case of an encounter, and Top, who\r\nwent ahead, ordered to search the edge of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe first five miles of the distance was rapidly traversed, and not the\r\nslightest sign of any human being was seen. When the colonists arrived\r\nat the point where the curvature of the promontory ended, and\r\nWashington Bay began, they were able to take in at one view the whole\r\nextent of the southern coast. Twenty-five miles distant the shore was\r\nterminated by Claw Cape, which was faintly visible through the morning\r\nmists, and reproduced as a mirage in mid-air. Between the place\r\noccupied by the colonists and the upper end of the Great Bay the shore\r\nbegan with a flat and continuous beach, bordered in the background by\r\ntall trees; following this, it became very irregular, and thrust sharp\r\npoints into the sea, and finally a heap of black rocks, thrown together\r\nin picturesque disorder, completed the distance to Claw Cape.\r\n\r\n“A ship would surely be lost on these sands and shoals and reefs,” said\r\nPencroff.\r\n\r\n“It is poor quarters!”\r\n\r\n“But at least a portion of her would be left,” observed the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Some bits of wood would remain on the reefs, nothing on the sands,”\r\nanswered the sailor.\r\n\r\n“How is that?”\r\n\r\n“Because the sands are even more dangerous than the rocks, and swallow\r\nup everything that is thrown upon them; a few days suffice to bury out\r\nof sight the hull of a ship of many tons measurement.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Pencroff,” questioned the engineer, “if a vessel had been lost\r\non these banks, it would not be surprising if there was no trace left?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, that is after a time or after a tempest. Nevertheless, it\r\nwould be surprising, as now, that no spars or timbers were thrown upon\r\nthe shore beyond the reach of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Let us continue our search,” replied Smith.\r\n\r\nBy 1 o’clock the party had accomplished twenty miles, having reached\r\nthe upper end of Washington Bay, and they stopped to lunch.\r\n\r\nHere began an irregular shore, oddly cut into by a long line of rocks,\r\nsucceeding the sand banks, and just beginning to show themselves by\r\nlong streaks of foam, above the undulations of the receding waves. From\r\nthis point to Claw Cape the beach was narrow and confined between the\r\nreef of rocks and the forest, and the march would therefore be more\r\ndifficult. The granite wall sunk more and more, and above it the tops\r\nof the trees, undisturbed by a breath of air, appeared in the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour’s rest the colonists took up the march again, on the\r\nlookout for any sign of a wreck, but without success. They found out,\r\nhowever, that edible mussels were plenty on this beach, although they\r\nwould not gather them until means of transport between the two banks of\r\nthe river should have been perfected.\r\n\r\nTowards 3 o’clock, Smith and his companions reached a narrow inlet,\r\nunfed by any water-course. It formed a veritable little natural harbor,\r\ninvisible from without, and approached by a narrow passage guarded by\r\nthe reefs. At the upper end of this creek some violent convulsion had\r\nshattered the rock, and a narrow, sloping passage gave access to the\r\nupper plateau, which proved to be ten miles from Claw Cape, and\r\ntherefore four miles in a direct line from Prospect Plateau.\r\n\r\nSpilett proposed to his companions to halt here, and, as the march had\r\nsharpened their appetites, although it was not dinner time, no one\r\nobjected to a bit of venison, and with this lunch they would be able to\r\nawait supper at Granite House.\r\n\r\nSoon the colonists, seated under a group of splendid pines, were eating\r\nheartily of the provisions which Neb had brought out from his\r\nhaversack. The place was some fifty or sixty feet above the sea, and\r\nthe view, extending beyond the furthest rock of the cape, was lost in\r\nUnion Bay. But the islet and Prospect Plateau were invisible, as the\r\nhigh ground and the curtain of high trees shut out the horizon to the\r\nnorth. Neither over the extent of sea nor on that part of the coast\r\nwhich it was still necessary to explore could they discover even with\r\nthe spyglass any suspicious object.\r\n\r\n“Well” said Spilett, “we can console ourselves by thinking that no one\r\nis disputing the island with us.”\r\n\r\n“But how about the pellet?” said Herbert. “It was not a dream.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed it was not!” cried Pencroff, thinking of his missing tooth.\r\n\r\n“Well, what are we to conclude?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“This,” said Smith, “that within three months a ship, voluntarily or\r\notherwise, has touched—”\r\n\r\n“What! You will admit, Cyrus, that it has been swallowed up without\r\nleaving any trace?” cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear Spilett; but you must remember that while it is certain\r\nthat a human being has been here, it seems just as certain that he is\r\nnot here now.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if I understand you sir,” said Herbert, “the ship has gone\r\nagain?”\r\n\r\n“Evidently.”\r\n\r\n“And we have lost, beyond return, a chance to get home?” said Neb.\r\n\r\n“I believe without return.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, since the chance is lost, let us push on,” said Pencroff,\r\nalready home-sick for Granite House.\r\n\r\n“But, just as they were rising, Top’s barking was heard, and the dog\r\nburst from the forest, holding in his mouth a soiled rag.\r\n\r\nNeb took it from him. It was a bit of strong cloth. Top, still barking,\r\nseemed by his motions to invite his master to follow into the wood.\r\n\r\n“Here is something which will explain my bullet,” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“A shipwrecked person!” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Wounded, perhaps!” exclaimed Neb.\r\n\r\n“Or dead!” responded the reporter.\r\n\r\nAnd all holding their arms in readiness, hurried after the dog through\r\nthe outskirts of the forests. They advanced some distance into the\r\nwood, but, to their disappointment, they saw no tracks. The underbrush\r\nand lianas were uninjured and had to be cut away with the hatchet, as\r\nin the depths of the forest. It was hard to imagine that any human\r\ncreature had passed there, and yet Top’s action showed no uncertainty,\r\nbut was more like that of a human being having a fixed purpose.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the dog stopped. The colonists, who had arrived at a\r\nsort of glade surrounded by high trees, looked all about them, but\r\nneither in the underbrush or between the tree trunks could they\r\ndiscover a thing.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Top?” said Smith.\r\n\r\nTop, barking louder, ran to the foot of a gigantic pine.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Pencroff exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“This is capital!”\r\n\r\n“What’s that,” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“We’ve been hunting for some waif on the sea or land—”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“And here it is in the air!”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor pointed out a mass of faded cloth caught on the summit\r\nof the pine, a piece of which Top had found on the ground.\r\n\r\n“But that is no waif!” exclaimed Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Indeed it is,” answered Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“How is it!”\r\n\r\n“It is all that is left of our balloon, of our ship which is stranded\r\non the top of this tree.”\r\n\r\nPencroff was not mistaken, and he added, with a shout:—\r\n\r\n“And there is good stuff in it which will keep us in linen for years.\r\nIt will make us handkerchiefs and shirts. Aha, Mr. Spilett! what do you\r\nsay of an island where shirts grow on the trees?”\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a fortunate thing for the colonists that the aerostat,\r\nafter having made its last bound into the air, had fallen again on the\r\nisland. They could, either keep the envelope in its present shape, in\r\ncase they might desire to attempt a new flight through the air, or,\r\nafter having taken off the varnish, they could make use of its hundreds\r\nof ells of good cotton cloth. At these thoughts all shared Pencroff’s\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task to take down this envelope from the tree top. But\r\nNeb, Herbert, and the sailor climbed up to it, and after two hours of\r\nhard work not only the envelope, with its valve, springs, and leather\r\nmountings, but the net, equivalent to a large quantity of cordage and\r\nropes, together with the iron ring and the anchor, lay upon the ground.\r\nThe envelope, excepting the rent, was in good order, and only its lower\r\nend had been torn away.\r\n\r\nIt was a gift from heaven.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, Mr. Smith,” said the sailor, “if we ever do decide to\r\nleave the island it won’t be in a balloon, I hope. These air ships\r\ndon’t always go the way you want them to, as we have found out. If you\r\nwill let me have my way, we will build a ship of twenty tons, and you\r\nwill allow me to cut from this cloth a foresail and jib. The rest of it\r\nwill do for clothes.”\r\n\r\n“We will see about it, Pencroff,” answered Smith.\r\n\r\n“And meanwhile it must all be put away carefully,” said Neb.\r\n\r\nIn truth, they could not think of carrying all this weight of material\r\nto Granite House; and while waiting for a proper means of removing it,\r\nit was important not to leave it exposed to the weather. The colonists,\r\nuniting their efforts, succeeded in dragging it to the shore, where\r\nthey discovered a cave so situated that neither wind, rain, nor sea\r\ncould get at it.\r\n\r\n“It is a wardrobe,” said Pencroff; “but since it does not kick, it will\r\nbe prudent to hide the opening, not, perhaps from two-footed, but from\r\nfour-footed thieves!”\r\n\r\nBy 6 o’clock everything was stored away, and after having named the\r\nlittle inlet, Balloon, Harbor, they took the road for Claw Cape.\r\nPencroff and the engineer discussed several projects, which it would be\r\nwell to attend to at once. The first thing was to build a bridge across\r\nthe Mercy, and, as the canoe was too small, to bring the balloon over\r\nin the cart. Then to build a decked launch, which Pencroff would make\r\ncutter-rigged, and in which they could make voyages of\r\ncircumnavigation—around the island; then, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the night approached, and it was already dark, when the\r\ncolonists reached Jetsam Point, where they had discovered the precious\r\nbox. But here, as elsewhere, there was nothing to indicate a shipwreck,\r\nand it became necessary to adopt the opinions expressed by Smith.\r\n\r\nThe four miles from Jetsam Point to Granite House were quickly\r\ntraversed, but it was midnight when the colonists arrived at the first\r\nbend above the mouth of the Mercy. There the river was eighty feet\r\nwide, and Pencroff, who had undertaken to overcome the difficulty of\r\ncrossing it, set to work. It must be admitted that the colonists were\r\nfatigued. The tramp had been long, and the incident of the balloon had\r\nnot rested their arms or legs. They were therefore anxious to get back\r\nto Granite House to supper and bed, and if they had only had the\r\nbridge, in a quarter of an hour they could have been at home.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark. Pencroff and Neb, armed with the hatchets,\r\nchose two trees near the bank, and began cutting them down, in order to\r\nmake a raft. Smith and Spilett, seated on the ground, waited to assist\r\ntheir companions, and Herbert sauntered about, doing nothing.\r\n\r\nAll at once the lad, who had gone up the stream, returned hurriedly,\r\nand, pointing back, exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“What is that drifting there?”\r\n\r\nPencroff stopped work and perceived an object resting motionless in the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\n“A canoe!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAll came up and saw, to their astonishment, a boat following the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\n“Canoe, ahoy!” shouted Pencroff from force of habit, forgetting that it\r\nmight be better to keep quiet.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. The boat continued to drift, and it was not more\r\nthan a dozen paces off, when the sailor exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s our canoe! She has broken away and drifted down with the\r\ncurrent. Well, we must admit that she comes in the nick of time!”\r\n\r\n“Our canoe!” murmured the engineer.\r\n\r\nPencroff was right. It was indeed their canoe, which had doubtless\r\nbroken loose and drifted all the way from the headwaters of the Mercy!\r\nIt was important to seize it in passing before it should be drawn into\r\nthe rapid current at the mouth of the river, and Pencroff and Neb, by\r\nthe aid of a long pole, did this, and drew the canoe to the bank.\r\n\r\nThe engineer stepped in first, and, seizing the rope, assured himself\r\nthat it had been really worn in two against the rocks.\r\n\r\n“This,” said the reporter in an undertone; “this is a coincidence—”\r\n\r\n“It is very strange!” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\nAt least it was fortunate, and while no one could doubt that the rope\r\nhad been broken by friction, the astonishing part of the affair was\r\nthat the canoe had arrived at the moment when the colonists were there\r\nto seize it, for a quarter of an hour later, and it would have been\r\ncarried out to sea. Had there been such things as genii, this incident\r\nwould have been sufficient to make the colonists believe that the\r\nisland was inhabited by a supernatural being, who placed his power at\r\ntheir disposal.\r\n\r\nWith a few strokes the party arrived at the mouth of the Mercy. The\r\ncanoe was drawn on shore at the Chimneys, and all took their way to the\r\nladder at Granite House.\r\n\r\nBut, just then, Top began barking furiously, and Neb, who was feeling\r\nfor the lower rung, cried out:—\r\n\r\n“The ladder’s gone!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPENCROFF’S HALLOOS—A NIGHT IN THE CHIMNEYS—HERBERT’S ARROW—SMITH’S\r\nPLAN—AN UNEXPECTED SOLUTION—WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN GRANITE HOUSE—HOW THE\r\nCOLONISTS OBTAINED A NEW DOMESTIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith stood silent. His companions searched in the obscurity along the\r\nwall, over the ground, for the broken part of the ladder, supposing it\r\nhad been torn off by the wind. But the ladder had certainly\r\ndisappeared, although it was impossible to tell in the darkness whether\r\na gust of wind had not carried it up and lodged it on the first ledge.\r\n\r\n“If this is a joke, it’s a pretty poor one,” cried Pencroff. “To get\r\nhome and not be able to find the staircase, won’t do for tired men.”\r\n\r\nNeb stood in open-mouthed amazement.\r\n\r\n“It could not have been carried away by the wind!” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I’m beginning to think that strange things happen in Lincoln Island!”\r\nsaid Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Strange?” rejoined Spilett. “Why no, Pencroff, nothing is more\r\nnatural. Somebody has come while we have been absent, and has taken\r\npossession of the house and drawn up the ladder!”.\r\n\r\n“Some one!” cried the sailor. “Who could it be?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the man who shot the bullet,” answered the reporter “How else can\r\nyou explain it?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, if any one is up there,” replied Pencroff, beginning to get\r\nangry, “I will hail him, and he had better answer.”\r\n\r\nAnd in a voice of thunder the sailor gave a prolonged “Ohe,” which was\r\nloudly repeated by the echoes.\r\n\r\nThe colonists listened, and thought that they heard a sort of chuckling\r\nproceed from Granite House. But there was no answering voice to the\r\nsailor, who repeated his appeal in vain.\r\n\r\nHere was an event that would have astonished people the most\r\nindifferent, and from their situation the colonists could not be that.\r\nTo them, the slightest incident was of moment, and certainly during\r\ntheir seven months’ residence nothing equal to this had happened.\r\n\r\nThey stood there at the foot of Granite House not knowing what to do or\r\nto say. Neb was disconsolate at not being able to get back to the\r\nkitchen, especially as the provisions taken for the journey had all\r\nbeen eaten, and they had no present means of renewing them.\r\n\r\n“There is but one thing to do, my friends,” said Smith, “to wait until\r\ndaylight, and then to be governed by circumstances. Meanwhile let us go\r\nto the Chimneys, where we will be sheltered, and, even if we cannot\r\neat, we can sleep.”\r\n\r\n“But who is the ill-mannered fellow that has played us this trick?”\r\nasked Pencroff again, who thought it no joke.\r\n\r\nWhoever he was, there was nothing to do but to follow the engineer’s\r\nadvice. Top having been ordered to lie down under the windows of\r\nGranite House, took his place without complaint. The brave dog remained\r\nat the foot of the wall, while his master and his companions took\r\nshelter among the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, tired as they were, slept but little. Not only were\r\ntheir beds uncomfortable, but it was certain that their house was\r\noccupied at present, and they were unable to get into it. Now Granite\r\nHouse was not only their dwelling, it was their storehouse. Everything\r\nthey possessed was stored there. It would be a serious thing if this\r\nshould be pillaged and they should have again to begin at the\r\nbeginning. In their anxiety, one or the other went out often to see if\r\nthe dog remained on watch. Smith, alone, waited with his accustomed\r\npatience, although he was exasperated at finding himself confronted by\r\nsomething utterly inexplicable, and his reason shrank from the thought\r\nthat around him, over him, perhaps, was exercising an influence to\r\nwhich he could give no name. Spilett sharing his thoughts, they\r\nconversed together in an undertone of those unaccountable events which\r\ndefied all their knowledge and experience. Certainly, there was a\r\nmystery about this island, but how discover it? Even Herbert did not\r\nknow what to think, and often questioned Smith. As to Neb, he said that\r\nthis was his master’s business and not his; and if he had not feared\r\noffending his companions, the brave fellow would have slept this night\r\nas soundly as if he had been in his bed in Granite House.\r\n\r\nPencroff, however, was very much put out.\r\n\r\n“It’s a joke,” he said. “It’s a joke that is played on us. Well, I\r\ndon’t like such jokes, and the joker won’t like it, if I catch him!”\r\n\r\nAt dawn the colonists, well armed, followed along the shore to the\r\nreefs. By 5 o’clock the closed windows of Granite House appeared\r\nthrough their leafy curtain. Everything, from this side, appeared to be\r\nin order, but an exclamation escaped from the colonists when they\r\nperceived that the door which they had left closed was wide open. There\r\ncould be no more doubt that some one was in Granite House, The upper\r\nladder was in its place; but the lower had been drawn up to the\r\nthreshold. It was evident that the intruders wished to guard against a\r\nsurprise. As to telling who or how many they were, that was still\r\nimpossible, as none had yet shown themselves.\r\n\r\nPencroff shouted again, but without answer.\r\n\r\n“The beggars!” he exclaimed, “to sleep as soundly as if they were at\r\nhome! Halloo! pirates! bandits! corsairs! sons of John Bull!”\r\n\r\nWhen Pencroff, as an American, called any one a “son of John Bull,” he\r\nhad reached the acme of insult.\r\n\r\nJust then, the day broke and the facade of Granite House was\r\nilluminated by the rays of the rising sun. But inside as well as\r\nwithout all was still and calm. It was evident from the position of the\r\nladder that whoever had been inside the house had not come out. But how\r\ncould they get up to them?\r\n\r\nHerbert conceived the idea of shooting an arrow attached to a cord\r\nbetween the lower rungs of the ladder which were hanging from the\r\ndoorway: They would thus be able by means of the cord to pull this\r\nladder down, and gain access to Granite House. There was evidently\r\nnothing else to do, and with a little skill this attempt might prove\r\nsuccessful. Fortunately there were bows and arrows at the Chimneys, and\r\nthey found there, also, some twenty fathoms of light hibiscus cord.\r\nPencroff unrolled this, and fastened the end to a well-feathered arrow.\r\nThen Herbert having placed the arrow in his bow took careful aim at the\r\nhanging part of the ladder.\r\n\r\nThe others stationed themselves some distance in the background to\r\nobserve what might happen, and the reporter covered the doorway with\r\nhis carbine.\r\n\r\nThe bow bent, the arrow shot upward with the cord, and passed between\r\nthe two lower rungs of the ladder. The operation had succeeded. But\r\njust as Herbert, having caught the end of the cord, was about giving it\r\na pull to make the ladder fall, an arm thrust quickly between the door\r\nand the wall seized the ladder and drew it within Granite House.\r\n\r\n“You little beggar!” cried Pencroff. “If a ball would settle you, you\r\nwould not have to wait long!”\r\n\r\n“But what is it?” demanded Neb.\r\n\r\n“What! didn’t you see?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s a monkey, a macauco, a sapajo, an orang, a baboon, a\r\ngorilla, a sagoin! Our house has been invaded by monkeys, which have\r\nclimbed up the ladder while we were away.”\r\n\r\nAnd at the moment, as if to prove the truth of what the sailor said,\r\nthree or four quadrumana threw open the window shutters and saluted the\r\ntrue proprietors of the place with a thousand contortions and grimaces.\r\n\r\n“I knew all the time it was a joke,” cried Pencroff, “But here’s one of\r\nthe jokers that will pay for the others!” he added, covering a monkey\r\nwith his gun and firing. All disappeared but, this one, which, mortally\r\nwounded, fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThis monkey was very large and evidently belonged to the first order of\r\nquadrumana. Whether a chimpanzee, an orang, a gorilla, or a gibbon, it\r\nranked among these anthropomorphi, so called on account of their\r\nlikeness to the human race. Herbert declared it was an orang-outang,\r\nand we all know that the lad understood zoology.\r\n\r\n“What a fine beast!” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“As fine as you choose!” answered the reporter, “but I don’t see yet\r\nhow we are going to get in!”\r\n\r\n“Herbert is a good shot,” said the reporter, “and his bow is sure! We\r\nwill try again—”\r\n\r\n“But these monkeys are mischievous,” cried Pencroff, “and if they don’t\r\ncome to the windows, we cannot shoot them; and when I think of the\r\ndamage they can do in the rooms and, in the magazine—”\r\n\r\n“Have patience,” answered Smith. “These animals cannot hold us in\r\ncheck, very long.”\r\n\r\n“I will be sure of that when they are out of there, “rejoined Pencroff,\r\n“Can you say how many dozens of these fools there may be?”\r\n\r\nIt would hare been hard to answer Pencroff, but it was harder to try\r\nagain the experiment of the arrow, as the lower end of the ladder had\r\nbeen drawn within the doorway, and when they pulled on the cord again,\r\nit broke, and the ladder remained, as before.\r\n\r\nIt was, Indeed, vexatious. Pencroff was in a fury, and, although the\r\nsituation had a certain comic aspect, he did not think it funny at all.\r\nIt was evident that the colonists would, eventually, get back into\r\ntheir house and drive out the monkeys, but when and how they could not\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed, during which the monkeys avoided showing themselves;\r\nbut they were there, for all that, and, two or three times, a muzzle or\r\npaw slipped by the door or the windows, and was saluted by a shot.\r\n\r\n“Let us conceal ourselves,” said the engineer, at length. “And then the\r\nmonkeys will think we have gone off, and will show themselves again.\r\nLet Herbert and Spilett remain hidden behind the rocks and fire on any\r\nthat appear.\r\n\r\nThe directions of the engineer were followed, and while the reporter\r\nand the lad, who were the best shots in the party, took their\r\npositions, the others went over the plateau to the forest to shoot some\r\ngame, as it was breakfast time and they had no food.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour the hunters returned with some wild pigeons, which\r\nwould be pretty good roasted. Not a monkey had shown itself.\r\n\r\nSpilett and Herbert went to their breakfast, while Top kept watch under\r\nthe windows. Then they returned to their post. Two hours later the\r\nsituation was unchanged. The quadrumana gave no sign of existence, and\r\nit seemed as if they must have disappeared; but it was more likely\r\nthat, frightened by the death of one of their number and the\r\ndetonations of the guns, they kept themselves hidden in the chambers or\r\nthe store-room of Granite House. And, when the colonists thought of all\r\nthat was stored in this latter room, the patience which the engineer\r\nhad recommended turned into irritation, and indeed they could not be\r\nblamed for it.\r\n\r\n“It is too bad!” exclaimed the reporter, at length; “and is there no\r\nway we can put an end to this?”\r\n\r\n“We must make these beggars give up!” cried Pencroff. “We can readily\r\ndo it, even if there are twenty of them, in a hand-to hand fight! Oh,\r\nis there no way we can get at them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Smith, struck by an idea.\r\n\r\n“Only one?” rejoined Pencroff. “Well, that’s better than none at all.\r\nWhat is it?”\r\n\r\n“Try to get into Granite House by the old weir,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Why in the mischief didn’t I think of that!” cried the sailor.\r\n\r\nThis was, indeed, the only way to get into Granite House, in order to\r\nfight the band and drive them out. It is true that, if they tore down\r\nthe cemented wall which closed the weir, the work would have all to be\r\ndone over again; but, fortunately, Smith had not yet effected his\r\ndesign of hiding this opening by covering it again with the lake, as\r\nthat operation necessitated a good deal of time.\r\n\r\nIt was already past noon when the colonists, well armed and furnished\r\nwith picks and mattocks, left the Chimneys, passed under the windows of\r\nGranite House, and, having ordered Top to remain at his post, made\r\nready to climb the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect\r\nPlateau. But they had hardly gone fifty paces, when they heard the loud\r\nbarkings of the dog, as if making a desperate appeal. All halted.\r\n\r\n“Let us run back,” cried Pencroff. And all did as proposed as fast as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nArrived at the turn, the whole situation was changed. The monkeys,\r\nseized with a sudden fright, startled by some unknown cause, were\r\ntrying to escape. Two or three were running and springing from window\r\nto window, with the agility of clowns. In their fright they seemed to\r\nhave forgotten to replace the ladder, by which they could easily have\r\ndescended. In a moment half a dozen were in such a position that they\r\ncould be shot, and the colonists, taking aim, fired. Some fell, wounded\r\nor killed, within the chambers, uttering sharp cries. Others, falling\r\nto the ground without, were crushed by the fall, and a few moments\r\nafterwards it seemed as if there was not one living quadrumana in\r\nGranite House.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah,” said Pencroff, “hurrah, hurrah!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t cheer yet,” saidSpilett.\r\n\r\n“Why not,” asked Pencroff. “Ain’t they all killed.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless: but that does not give us the means of getting in.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go the weir!” exclaimed Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“We will have to,” said the engineer. “Nevertheless it would have been\r\npreferable—”\r\n\r\nAnd at the instant, as if in answer to the observation of the engineer,\r\nthey saw the ladder slide over the door-sill and roll over to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“By the thousand pipes, but that is lucky!” cried Pencroff, looking at\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\n“Too lucky!” muttered Smith, springing up the ladder.\r\n\r\n“Take care, Mr. Smith!” exclaimed Pencroff, “if there should be any\r\nsojourners—”\r\n\r\n“We will soon see,” responded the other.\r\n\r\nAll his companions followed him and in a moment were within the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nThey searched everywhere. No one was in the chambers or in the\r\nstoreroom, which remained undisturbed by the quadrumana.\r\n\r\n“And the ladder,” said Pencroff; “where is the gentleman who pushed it\r\ndown to us?”\r\n\r\nBut just then a cry was heard, and a huge monkey, that had taken refuge\r\nin the corridor, sprang into the great hall, followed by Neb.\r\n\r\n“Ah, the thief!” cried Pencroff, about to spring with his hatchet at\r\nthe head of the animal, when Smith stopped him.\r\n\r\n“Spare it, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\n“What, spare this black ape?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is he that has thrown us the ladder,” said the engineer, in a\r\nvoice so strange, that it was hard to say whether he was in earnest or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all threw themselves on the monkey, which, after a brave\r\nresistance, was thrown down and tied.\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” exclaimed Pencroff; “and now what will we do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Make a servant of it,” answered Herbert, half in earnest, as the lad\r\nknew how great was the intelligence of this race of quadrumana.\r\n\r\nThe colonists gathered round the monkey and examined it attentively. It\r\nappeared to belong to that species of anthropomorphi in which the\r\nfacial angle is not visibly inferior to that of the Australians or\r\nHottentots. He was an orang of the kind which has neither the ferocity\r\nof the baboon nor the macauco, nor the thoughtlessness of the sagoin,\r\nnor the impatience of the magot, nor the bad instincts of the\r\ncynocephalous. It was of a family of anthropomorphi which has traits\r\nindicating a half-human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait\r\non the table, do chamber-work, brush clothes, black boots, clean the\r\nknives and forks, and—empty the bottles, as well as the best trained\r\nflunkey. Buffon possessed one of these monkeys, which served him a long\r\ntime as a zealous and faithful servant.\r\n\r\nThe one at present tied in the hall of Granite House was a big fellow,\r\nsix feet high, deep-chested, and finely built, a medium-sized head,\r\nwith a sharp facial angle, a well-rounded skull, and a prominent nose,\r\nand a skin covered with smooth hair, soft and shining,—in short, a\r\nfinished type of anthropomorphi. Its eyes, somewhat smaller than those\r\nof a human being, sparkled with intelligence; its teeth glistened\r\nbeneath its moustache, and it wore a small nut-brown beard.\r\n\r\n“He is a fine chap,” said Pencroff. “If we only understood his\r\nlanguage, one might talk with him!”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Neb, “are they in earnest, my master? Will we take it as a\r\ndomestic?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Neb,” said the engineer, smiling. “But you need not be jealous.”\r\n\r\n“And I hope it will make an excellent servant. As it is young its\r\neducation will be easy, and we will not have to use force to make it\r\nmind, nor to pull out its teeth as is sometimes done. It cannot fail to\r\nbecome attached to masters who only treat it well.”\r\n\r\n“And we will do that,” said Pencroff, who having forgotten his recent\r\nwrath against the “jokers,” approached the orang and accosted him\r\nwith:—\r\n\r\n“Hullo, my boy, how goes it?”\r\n\r\nThe orang responded with a little grunt, which seemed to denote a not\r\nbad temper.\r\n\r\n“You want to join the colony, do you? Would you like to enter the\r\nservice of Mr. Smith?”\r\n\r\nThe monkey gave another affirmative grunt.\r\n\r\n“And you’ll be satisfied with your board as wages?”\r\n\r\nA third affirmative grunt.\r\n\r\n“His conversation is a little monotonous,” observed Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Pencroff, “the best domestics are those that speak\r\nleast. And then, no wages! Do you hear, my boy? At first we give you no\r\nwages, but we will double them later, if you suit us!”\r\n\r\nThus the colonists added to their number one who had already done them\r\na service. As to a name, the sailor asked that he should be called, in\r\nremembrance of another monkey, Jupiter, or by abbreviation, Jup. And\r\nthus, without more ado, Master Jup was installed in Granite House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECTS TO BE CARRIED OUT—A BRIDGE OVER THE MERCY—TO MAKE AN ISLAND OF\r\nPROSPECT PLATEAU—THE DRAW-BRIDGE—THE CORN HARVEST—THE STREAM—THE\r\nCAUSEWAY—THE POULTRY YARD—THE PIGEON-HOUSE—THE TWO WILD ASSES—HARNESSED\r\nTO THE WAGON—EXCURSION TO BALLOON HARBOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colonists had now reconquered their domicile without having been\r\nobliged to follow the weir. It was, indeed, fortunate, that at the\r\nmoment they decided to destroy their masonry, the band of monkeys,\r\nstruck by a terror not less sudden than inexplicable, had rushed from\r\nGranite House. Had these animals a presentiment that a dangerous attack\r\nwas about to be made on them from another direction? This was the only\r\nway to account for their retreat.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was occupied in carrying the dead monkeys to the\r\nwood and burying them there, and in repairing the disorder made by the\r\nintruders,—disorder and not damage, as, though they had upset the\r\nfurniture in the rooms, they had broken nothing. Neb rekindled the\r\nrange, and the supply in the pantry furnished a substantial repast that\r\nwas duly honored.\r\n\r\nJup was not forgotten, and he ate with avidity the pistachio nuts and\r\nthe roots of the sumach, with which he saw himself abundantly provided.\r\nPencroff had unfastened his arms, although he thought it best to keep\r\nthe monkey’s legs bound until they could be sure he had surrendered.\r\n\r\nSeated at the table, before going to bed, Smith and his companions\r\ndiscussed three projects, the execution of which was urgent. The most\r\nimportant and the most pressing was the establishment of a bridge\r\nacross the Mercy, then the building of a corral, designed for the\r\naccommodation of moufflons or other woolly animals which they had\r\nagreed to capture. These two plans tended to solve the question of\r\nclothing, which was then the most serious question.\r\n\r\nIt was Smith’s intention to establish this corral at the sources of Red\r\nCreek, where there was abundant pasturage. Already the path between\r\nthere and Prospect Plateau was partially cleared, and with a better\r\nconstructed cart, carriage would be easy, especially if they should\r\ncapture some animal that could draw it.\r\n\r\nBut while it would not be inconvenient to have the corral some distance\r\nfrom Granite House, it was different with the poultry-yard, to which\r\nNeb called attention. It was necessary that the “chickens” should be at\r\nthe hand of the cook, and no place seemed more favorable for an\r\nestablishment of this kind than that portion of the lake shore\r\nbordering on the former weir. The aquatic birds also would thrive\r\nthere, and the pair of tinamons, taken in the last excursion, would\r\nserve as a beginning.\r\n\r\nThe next day—the 3d of November—work was begun on the bridge, and all\r\nhands were required on the important undertaking. Laden with tools the\r\ncolonists descended to the shore.\r\n\r\nHere Pencroff reflected as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Supposing while we are away Master Jup takes the notion of hauling up\r\nthe ladder, which he so gallantly unrolled for us yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“We would be dependent on his tail!” answered Spilett.\r\n\r\nThe ladder was therefore made fast to two stakes driven firmly into the\r\nground. The colonists ascended the river, and soon arrived at its\r\nnarrow bend, where they halted to examine whether the bridge could not\r\nbe thrown across at this place. The situation was suitable, as from\r\nthis point to Balloon Harbor the distance was three miles and a half,\r\nand a wagon road connecting Granite House with the southern part of the\r\nisland, could easily be constructed.\r\n\r\nThen Smith communicated to his companions a project which he had had in\r\nview for some time. This was to completely isolate Prospect Plateau, so\r\nas to protect it from all attacks of quadrupeds or quadrumana. By this\r\nmeans Granite House, the Chimneys, the poultry yard, and all the upper\r\npart of the plateau destined for sowing would be protected against the\r\ndepredations of animals.\r\n\r\nNothing could be easier than to do this, and the engineer proposed to\r\naccomplish it as follows:—The plateau was already protected on three\r\nsides by either natural or artificial water courses. On the northwest,\r\nby the bank of Lake Grant, extending from the angle against the former\r\nweir to the cut made in the east bank to draw off the water. On the\r\nnorth, by this new water course which had worn itself a bed both above\r\nand below the fall, which could be dug out sufficiently to render the\r\npassage impracticable to animals. And upon the east, by the sea itself,\r\nfrom the mouth of this new creek to the mouth of the Mercy. Therefore\r\nthe only part remaining open was the western part of the plateau\r\nincluded between the bend in the river and the southern angle of the\r\nlake, a distance of leas than a mile. But nothing could be easier than\r\nto dig a ditch, wide and deep, which would be filled from the lake, and\r\nflow into the Mercy. Doubtless the level of the lake would be lowered\r\nsomewhat by this new drain on its resources, but Smith had assured\r\nhimself that the flow of Red Creek was sufficient for his purpose.\r\n\r\n“Thus,” added the engineer, “Prospect Plateau will be a veritable\r\nisland, unconnected with the rest of our domain, save by the bridge\r\nwhich we will throw over the Mercy, by the two causeways already built\r\nabove and below the fall, and by the two others which are to be\r\nconstructed, one over the proposed ditch, and the other over the left\r\nbank of the Mercy. Now if this bridge and the causeways can be raised\r\nat will, Prospect Plateau will be secured from surprise.”\r\n\r\nSmith, in order to make his companions comprehend clearly his plans,\r\nhad made a plot of the plateau, and his project was rendered perfectly\r\nplain. It met with unanimous approval; and Pencroff, brandishing his\r\nhatchet, exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“And first, for the bridge!”\r\n\r\nThis work was the most urgent. Trees were selected, felled, lopped, and\r\ncut into beams, planks, and boards. The bridge was to be stationary on\r\nthe right bank of the Mercy, but on the left it was to be so\r\nconstructed as to raise by means of counterweights, as in some\r\ndraw-bridges.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this work, even if it could be easily\r\naccomplished, would take considerable time, as the Mercy was eighty\r\nfeet wide at this point. It was first necessary to drive piles in the\r\nbed of the river, to sustain the flooring of the bridge, and to set up\r\na pile-driver to drive the piles, so as to form two arches capable of\r\nsupporting heavy weights.\r\n\r\nFortunately they lacked neither the necessary tools for preparing the\r\ntimber, nor the iron work, to bind it together, nor the ingenuity of a\r\nman who was an adept at this sort of work, nor, finally, the zeal of\r\nhis companions who in these seven months had necessarily acquired\r\nconsiderable manual skill. And it should be added that Spilett began to\r\ndo nearly as well as the sailor himself “who would never have expected\r\nso much from a newspaper man!”\r\n\r\nIt took three weeks of steady work to build this bridge. And as the\r\nweather was fine they lunched on the ground, and only returned to\r\nGranite House for supper.\r\n\r\nDuring this period it was observed that Master Jup took kindly to and\r\nfamiliarized himself with his new masters, whom he watched with the\r\ngreatest curiosity. Nevertheless, Pencroff was careful not to give him\r\ncomplete liberty until the limits of the plateau had been rendered\r\nimpassible. Top and he were the best possible friends, and got on\r\ncapitally together although Jup took everything gravely.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was finished on the 20th of November. The movable part\r\nbalanced perfectly with the counterpoise, and needed but little effort\r\nto raise it; between the hinge and crossbeam on which the draw rested\r\nwhen closed, the distance was twenty feet, a gap sufficiently wide to\r\nprevent animals from getting across.\r\n\r\nIt was next proposed to go for the envelope of the balloon, which the\r\ncolonists were anxious to place in safety; but in order to bring it,\r\nthe cart would have to be dragged to Balloon Harbor, necessitating the\r\nbreaking of a road through the dense underwood of the Far West, all of\r\nwhich would take time. Therefore Neb and Pencroff made an excursion to\r\nthe harbor, and as they reported that the supply of cloth was well\r\nprotected in the cave, it was decided that the works about the plateau\r\nshould not be discontinued.\r\n\r\n“This,” said Pencroff, “will enable us to establish the poultry-yard\r\nunder the most advantageous conditions, since we need have no fear of\r\nthe visits of foxes or other noxious animals.”\r\n\r\n“And also,” added Neb, “we can clear the plateau, and transplant wild\r\nplants”—\r\n\r\n“And make ready our second corn-field,” continued the sailor with a\r\ntriumphant air.\r\n\r\nIndeed the first corn-field, sowed with a single grain, had prospered\r\nadmirably, thanks to the care of Pencroff. It had produced the ten ears\r\nforetold by the engineer, and as each ear had eighty grains, the\r\ncolonists found themselves possessed of 800 grains—in six months—which\r\npromised them a double harvest each year. These 800 grains, excepting\r\nfifty which it was prudent to reserve, were now about to be sowed in a\r\nnew field with as much care as the first solitary specimen.\r\n\r\nThe field was prepared, and inclosed with high, sharp-pointed\r\npalisades, which quadrupeds would have found very difficult to\r\nsurmount. As to the birds, the noisy whirligigs and astonishing\r\nscarecrows, the product of Pencroff’s genius, were enough to keep them\r\nat a distance. Then the 750 grains were buried in little hills,\r\nregularly disposed, and Nature was left to do the rest.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of November, Smith began laying out the ditch which was to\r\nenclose the plateau on the west. There were two or three feet of\r\nvegetable earth, and beneath that the granite. It was, therefore,\r\nnecessary to manufacture some more nitro-glycerine, and the\r\nnitro-glycerine had its accustomed effect. In less than a fortnight a\r\nditch, twelve feet wide and six feet deep was excavated in the plateau.\r\nA new outlet was in like manner made in the rocky border of the lake,\r\nand the waters rushed into this new channel, forming a small stream, to\r\nwhich they gave the name of Glycerine Creek. As the engineer had\r\nforeseen the level of the lake was lowered but very slightly. Finally,\r\nfor completing the enclosure, the bed of the stream across the beach\r\nwas considerably enlarged, and the sand was kept up by a double\r\npalisade.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of December all these works were completed, and Prospect\r\nPlateau, shaped something like an irregular pentagon, having a\r\nperimeter of about four miles, was encircled with a liquid belt, making\r\nit absolutely safe from all aggression.\r\n\r\nDuring this month the heat was very great. Nevertheless, the colonists,\r\nnot wishing to cease work, proceeded to construct the poultry-yard.\r\nJup, who since the enclosing of the plateau had been given his liberty,\r\nnever quitted his masters nor manifested the least desire to escape. He\r\nwas a gentle beast, though possessing immense strength and wonderful\r\nagility. No one could go up the ladder to Granite House as he could.\r\nAlready he was given employment; he was instructed to fetch wood and\r\ncarry off the stones which had been taken from the bed of Glycerine\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\n“Although he’s not yet a mason, he is already a ‘monkey,’“ said\r\nHerbert, making a joking allusion to the nickname masons give their\r\napprentices. And if ever a name was well applied, it was so in this\r\ninstance!\r\n\r\nThe poultry-yard occupied an area of 200 square yards on the southeast\r\nbank of the lake. It was enclosed with a palisade, and within were\r\nseparate divisions for the proposed inhabitants, and huts of branches\r\ndivided into compartments awaiting their occupants.\r\n\r\nThe first was the pair of tinamons, who were not long in breeding\r\nnumerous little ones. They had for companions half-a-dozen ducks, who\r\nwere always by the water-side. Some of these belonged to that Chinese\r\nvariety whose wings open like a fan, and whose plumage rivals in\r\nbrilliance that of the golden pheasant. Some days later, Herbert caught\r\na pair of magnificent curassows, birds of the gallinaceæ family, with\r\nlong rounding tails. These soon bred others, and as to the pellicans,\r\nthe kingfishers, the moorhens, they came of themselves to the\r\npoultry-yard. And soon, all this little world, after some disputing,\r\ncooing, scolding, clucking, ended by agreeing and multiplying at a rate\r\nsufficient for the future wants of the colony.\r\n\r\nSmith, in order to complete his work, established a pigeon-house in the\r\ncorner of the poultry-yard, and placed therein a dozen wild pigeons.\r\nThese birds readily habituated themselves to their new abode, and\r\nreturned there each evening, showing a greater propensity to\r\ndomestication than the wood pigeons, their congeners, which do not\r\nbreed except in a savage state.\r\n\r\nAnd now the time was come to make use of the envelope in the\r\nmanufacture of clothing, for to keep it intact in order to attempt to\r\nleave the island by risking themselves in a balloon filled with heated\r\nair over a sea, which might be called limitless, was only to be thought\r\nof by men deprived of all other resources, and Smith, being eminently\r\npractical, did not dream of such a thing.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to bring the envelope to Granite House, and the\r\ncolonists busied themselves in making their heavy cart less unwieldly\r\nand lighter. But though the vehicle was provided, the motor was still\r\nto be found! Did not there exist in the island some ruminant of\r\nindiginous species which could replace the horse, ass, ox, or cow? That\r\nwas the question.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Pencroff, “a draught animal would be very useful to us,\r\nwhile we are waiting until Mr. Smith is ready to build a steam-wagon or\r\na locomotive, though doubtless, some day we will have a railway to\r\nBalloon Harbor, with a branch road up Mount Franklin!”\r\n\r\nAnd the honest sailor, in talking thus, believed what he said. Such is\r\nthe power of imagination combined with faith!\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, an animal capable of being harnessed would have just\r\nsuited Pencroff, and as Fortune favored him, she did not let him want.\r\n\r\nOne day, the 23d of December, the colonists, busy at the Chimneys,\r\nheard Neb crying and Top barking in such emulation, that dreading some\r\nterrible accident, they ran to them.\r\n\r\nWhat did they see? Two large, beautiful animals, which had imprudently\r\nventured upon the plateau, the causeways not having been closed. They\r\nseemed like two horses, or rather two asses, male and female, finely\r\nshaped, of a light bay color, striped with black on the head, neck, and\r\nbody, and with white legs and tail. They advanced tranquilly, without\r\nshowing any fear, and looked calmly on these men in whom they had not\r\nyet recognized their masters.\r\n\r\n“They are onagers,” cried Herbert. “Quadrupeds of a kind between the\r\nzebra and the quagga.”\r\n\r\n“Why aren’t they asses?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Because they have not long ears, and their forms are more graceful.”\r\n\r\n“Asses or horses,” added Pencroff—“they are what Mr. Smith would call\r\n“motors,” and it will be well to capture them!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor, without startling the animals, slid through the grass to\r\nthe causeway over Glycerine Creek, raised it, and the onagers were\r\nprisoners. Should they be taken by violence, and made to submit to a\r\nforced domestication? No. It was decided that for some days they would\r\nlet these animals wander at will over the plateau where the grass was\r\nabundant, and a stable was at once constructed near to the poultry-yard\r\nin which the onagers would find a good bedding, and a refuge for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe fine pair were thus left entirely at liberty, and the colonists\r\navoided approaching them. In the meantime the onagers often tried to\r\nquit the plateau, which was too confined for them, accustomed to wide\r\nranges and deep forests. The colonists saw them following around the\r\nbelt of water impossible to cross, whinnying and galloping over the\r\ngrass, and then resting quietly for hours regarding the deep woods from\r\nwhich they were shut off.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, harness had been made from vegetable fibres, and some\r\ndays after the capture of the onagers, not only was the cart ready, but\r\na road, or rather a cut, had been made through the forest all the way\r\nfrom the bend in the Mercy to Balloon Harbor. They could therefore get\r\nto this latter place with the cart, and towards the end of the month\r\nthe onagers were tried for the first time.\r\n\r\nPencroff had already coaxed these animals so that they ate from his\r\nhand, and he could approach them without difficulty, but, once\r\nharnessed, they reared and kicked, and were with difficulty kept from\r\nbreaking loose, although it was not long before they submitted to this\r\nnew service.\r\n\r\nThis day, every one except Pencroff, who walked beside his team, rode\r\nin the cart to Balloon Harbor. They were jolted about a little over\r\nthis rough road, but the cart did not break down, and they were able to\r\nload it, the same day, with the envelope and the appurtenances to the\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nBy 8 o’clock in the evening, the cart, having recrossed the bridge,\r\nfollowed down the bank of the Mercy and stopped on the beach. The\r\nonagers were unharnessed, placed in the stable, and Pencroff, before\r\nsleeping, gave a sigh of satisfaction that resounded throughout Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTHING—SEAL-SKIN BOOTS—MAKING PYROXYLINE—PLANTING—THE FISH—TURTLES’\r\nEGGS—JUP’S EDUCATION—THE CORRAL-HUNTING MOUFFLONS—OTHER USEFUL ANIMALS\r\nAND VEGETABLES—HOME THOUGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first week In January was devoted to making clothing. The needles\r\nfound in the box were plied by strong, if not supple fingers, and what\r\nwas sewed, was sewed strongly. Thread was plenty, as Smith had thought\r\nof using again that with which the strips of the balloon had been\r\nfastened together. These long bands had been carefully unripped by\r\nSpilett and Herbert with commendable patience, since Pencroff had\r\nthrown aside the work, which bothered him beyond measure; but when it\r\ncame to sewing again the sailor was unequalled.\r\n\r\nThe varnish was then removed from the cloth by means of soda procured\r\nas before, and the cloth was afterwards bleached in the sun. Some\r\ndozens of shirts and socks—the latter, of course, not knitted, but made\r\nof sewed strips—were thus made. How happy it made the colonists to be\r\nclothed again in white linen—linen coarse enough, it is true, but they\r\ndid not mind that—and to lie between sheets, which transformed the\r\nbanks of Granite House into real beds! About this time they also made\r\nboots from seal leather, which were a timely substitute for those\r\nbrought from America. They were long and wide enough, and never pinched\r\nthe feet of the pedestrians.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year (1866) the hot weather was incessant, but\r\nthe hunting in the woods, which fairly swarmed with birds and beasts,\r\ncontinued; and Spilett and Herbert were too good shots to waste powder.\r\nSmith had recommended them to save their ammunition, and that they\r\nmight keep it for future use the engineer took measures to replace it\r\nby substances easily renewable. How could he tell what the future might\r\nhave in store for them in case they left the island? It behooved them,\r\ntherefore, to prepare for all emergencies.\r\n\r\nAs Smith had not discovered any lead in the island he substituted iron\r\nshot, which were easily made. As they were not so heavy as leaden ones\r\nthey had to be made larger, and the charges contained a less number,\r\nbut the skill of the hunters counterbalanced this defect. Powder he\r\ncould have made, since he had all the necessary materials but as its\r\npreparation requires extreme care, and as without special apparatus it\r\nis difficult to make it of good quality, Smith proposed to manufacture\r\npyroxyline, a kind of gun-cotton, a substance in which cotton is not\r\nnecessary, except as cellulose. Now cellulose is simply the elementary\r\ntissue of vegetables, and is found in almost a pure state not only in\r\ncotton, but also in the texile fibres of hemp and flax, in paper and\r\nold rags, the pith of the elder, etc. And it happened that elder trees\r\nabounded in the island towards the mouth of Red Creek:—the colonists\r\nhad already used its shoots and berries in place of coffee.\r\n\r\nThus they had the cellulose at hand, and the only other substance\r\nnecessary for the manufacture of pyroxyline was nitric acid, which\r\nSmith could easily produce as before. The engineer, therefore, resolved\r\nto make and use this combustible, although he was aware that it had\r\ncertain serious inconveniences, such as inflaming at 170° instead of\r\n240°, and a too instantaneous deflagration for firearms. On the other\r\nhand, pyroxyline had these advantages—it was not affected by dampness,\r\nit did not foul the gun-barrels, and its explosive force was four times\r\ngreater than that of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the pyroxyline, Smith made a mixture of three parts of\r\nnitric acid with five of concentrated sulphuric acid, and steeped the\r\ncellulose in this mixture for a quarter of an hour; afterwards it was\r\nwashed in fresh water and left to dry. The operation succeeded\r\nperfectly, and the hunters had at their disposal a substance perfectly\r\nprepared, and which, used with discretion, gave excellent results.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the colonists cleared three acres of Prospect Plateau,\r\nleaving the rest as pasture for the onagers. Many excursions were made\r\ninto Jacamar Wood and the Far West, and they brought back a perfect\r\nharvest of wild vegetables, spinach, cresses, charlocks, and radishes,\r\nwhich intelligent culture would greatly change, and which would serve\r\nto modify the flesh diet which the colonists had been obliged to put up\r\nwith. They also hauled large quantities of wood and coal, and each\r\nexcursion helped improve the roads by grinding down its inequalities\r\nunder the wheels.\r\n\r\nThe warren always furnished its contingent of rabbits, and as it was\r\nsituated without Glycerine creek, its occupants could not reach nor\r\ndamage the new plantations. As to the oyster-bed among the coast rocks,\r\nit furnished a daily supply of excellent mollusks. Further, fish from\r\nthe lake and river were abundant, as Pencroff had made set-lines on\r\nwhich they often caught trout and another very savory fish marked with\r\nsmall yellow spots on a silver-colored body. Thus Neb, who had charge\r\nof the culinary department, was able to make an agreeable change in the\r\nmenu of each repast. Bread alone was wanting at the colonists’ table,\r\nand they felt this privation exceedingly.\r\n\r\nSometimes the little party hunted the sea-turtles, which frequented the\r\ncoast at Mandible Cape. At this season the beach was covered with\r\nlittle mounds enclosing the round eggs, which were left to the sun to\r\nhatch; and as each turtle produces two hundred and fifty eggs annually,\r\ntheir number was very great.\r\n\r\n“It is a true egg-field,” said Spilett, “and all we have to do is to\r\ngather them.”\r\n\r\nBut they did not content themselves with these products; they hunted\r\nalso the producers, and took back to Granite House a dozen of these\r\nreptiles, which were excellent eating. Turtle soup, seasoned with\r\nherbs, and a handful of shell-fish thrown in, gained high praise for\r\nits concoctor, Neb.\r\n\r\nAnother fortunate event, which permitted them to make new provision for\r\nwinter, must be mentioned. Shoals of salmon ascended the Mercy for many\r\nmiles, in order to spawn. The river was full of these fish, which\r\nmeasured upwards of two feet in length, and it was only necessary to\r\nplace some barriers in the stream in order to capture a great many.\r\nHundreds were caught in this way, and salted down for winter, when the\r\nice would stop the fishing.\r\n\r\nJup, during this time, was elevated to the position of a domestic. He\r\nhad been clothed in a jacket, and short trowsers, and an apron with\r\npockets, which were his joy, as he kept his hands in them and allowed\r\nno one to search them. The adroit orang had been wonderfully trained by\r\nNeb, and one would have said they understood each other’s conversation.\r\nJup had, moreover, a real affection for the Negro, which was\r\nreciprocated. When the monkey was not wanted to carry wood or to climb\r\nto the top of some tree, he was passing his time in the kitchen,\r\nseeking to imitate Neb in all that he was doing. The master also showed\r\ngreat patience and zeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil showed\r\nremarkable intelligence in profiting by these lessons.\r\n\r\nGreat was the satisfaction one day when Master Jup, napkin on arm, came\r\nwithout having been called to wait on the table. Adroit and attentive,\r\nhe acquitted himself perfectly, changing the plates, bringing the\r\ndishes, and pouring the drink, all with a gravity which greatly amused\r\nthe colonists, and completely overcame Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Jup, some more soup! Jup, a bit more agouti! Jup, another plate! Jup,\r\nbrave, honest Jup!”\r\n\r\nJup, not in the least disconcerted, responded to every call, looked out\r\nfor everything, and nodded his head intelligently when the sailor,\r\nalluding to his former pleasantry said:—\r\n\r\n“Decidedly, Jup, we must double your wages!”\r\n\r\nThe orang had become perfectly accustomed, to Granite House, and often\r\naccompanied his masters to the forest without manifesting the least\r\ndesire to run off. It was laughable to see him march along with a stick\r\nof Pencroff’s on his shoulder, like a gun. If any one wanted some fruit\r\ngathered from a treetop how quickly be was up there. If the wagon\r\nwheels stuck in the mire, with what strength he raised it onto the road\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“What a Hercules!” exclaimed Pencroff. “If he was as mischievous as he\r\nis gentle we could not get along with him.”\r\n\r\nTowards the end of January the colonists undertook great work in the\r\ninterior of the island. It had been decided that they would establish\r\nat the foot of Mount Franklin, near the sources of Red Creek, the\r\ncorral destined to contain the animals whose presence would have been\r\nunpleasant near Granite House, and more particularly the moufflons,\r\nwhich were to furnish wool for winter clothing. Every morning all the\r\ncolonists, or oftener Smith, Herbert, and Pencroff, went with the\r\nonagers to the site, five miles distant, over what they called Corral\r\nRoad. There an extensive area had been chosen opposite the southern\r\nslope of the mountain. It was a level plain, having here and there\r\ngroups of trees, situated at the base of one of the spurs, which closed\r\nit in on that side. A small stream, rising close by, crossed it\r\ndiagonally, and emptied into Red Creek. The grass was lush, and the\r\nposition of the trees allowed the air to circulate freely. All that was\r\nnecessary was to build a palisade around to the mountain spur\r\nsufficiently high to keep in the animals. The enclosure would be large\r\nenough to contain one hundred cattle, moufflons or wild goats and their\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nThe line of the corral was marked out by the engineer, and they all set\r\nto work to cut down the trees necessary for the palisade. The road\r\nwhich they had made furnished some hundred trees, which were drawn to\r\nthe place and set firmly in the ground. At the back part of the\r\npalisade they made an entranceway, closed by a double gate made from\r\nthick plank, which could be firmly fastened on the outside.\r\n\r\nThe building of this corral took all of three weeks, as, besides the\r\nwork on the palisades, Smith put up large sheds for the animals. These\r\nwere made of planks, and, indeed, everything had to be made solidly and\r\nstrong, as moufflons have great strength, and their first resistance\r\nwas to be feared. The uprights, pointed at the end and charred, had\r\nbeen bolted together, and the strength of the whole had been augmented\r\nby placing braces at intervals.\r\n\r\nThe corral finished, the next thing was to inaugurate a grand hunt at\r\nthe pasturages, near the foot of Mount Franklin, frequented by the\r\nanimals. The time chosen was the 7th of February, a lovely summer day,\r\nand everybody took part in the affair. The two onagers, already pretty\r\nwell trained, were mounted by Spilett and Herbert and did excellent\r\nservice. The plan was to drive together the moufflons and goats by\r\ngradually narrowing the circle of the chase around them. Smith,\r\nPencroff, Neb, and Jup posted themselves in different parts of the\r\nwood, while the two horsemen and Top scoured the country for half a\r\nmile around the corral. The moufflons were very numerous in this\r\nneighborhood. These handsome animals were as large as deer, with larger\r\nhorns than those of rams, and a greyish-colored wool, mingled with long\r\nhair, like argali.\r\n\r\nThe hunt, with its going and coming, the racing backwards and forwards,\r\nthe shouting and hallooing, was fatiguing enough. Out of a hundred\r\nanimals that were driven together many escaped, but little by little\r\nsome thirty moufflons and a dozen wild goats were driven within the\r\ncorral, whose open gate seemed to offer a chance of escape. The result\r\nwas, therefore, satisfactory; and as many of these moufflons were\r\nfemales with young, it was certain that the herd would prosper, and\r\nmilk and skins be plenty in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the hunters returned to Granite House nearly tired out.\r\nNevertheless the next day they went back to look at the corral. The\r\nprisoners had tried hard to break down the palisade, but, not\r\nsucceeding, they had soon become quiet.\r\n\r\nNothing of any importance happened during February. The routine of\r\ndaily work continued, and while improving the condition of the existing\r\nroads, a third, starting from the enclosure, and directed towards the\r\nsouthern coast, was begun. This unknown portion of Lincoln Island was\r\none mass of forest, such as covered Serpentine Peninsula, giving\r\nshelter to the beasts from whose presence Spilett proposed to rid their\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nBefore the winter returned careful attention was given to the\r\ncultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted to the\r\nplateau, and Herbert seldom returned from an excursion without bringing\r\nback some useful vegetable. One day it was a kind of succory, from the\r\nseed of which an excellent oil can be pressed; another time, it was the\r\ncommon sorrel, whose anti-scorbutic properties were not to be\r\nneglected; and again, it was some of those valuable tubercles which\r\nhave always been cultivated in South America, those potatoes, of which\r\nmore than two hundred species are known at present. The kitchen garden,\r\nalready well enclosed, well watered, and well defended against the\r\nbirds, was divided into small beds of lettuce, sorrel, radish,\r\ncharlock, and other crucifers; and as the soil upon the plateau was of\r\nwonderful richness, abundant crops might be anticipated.\r\n\r\nNeither were various drinks wanting, and unless requiring wine, the\r\nmost fastidious could not have complained. To the Oswego tea, made from\r\nthe mountain mint, and the fermented liquor made from the roots of the\r\ndragon-tree, Smith added a genuine beer; this was made from the young\r\nshoots of the “abies nigra,” which, after having been boiled and\r\nfermented, yielded that agreeable and particularly healthful drink,\r\nknown to Americans as “spring beer,” that is, spruce beer.\r\n\r\nToward the close of summer the poultry yard received a fine pair of\r\nbustards belonging to the species “houbara,” remarkable for a sort of\r\nshort cloak of feathers and a membranous pouch extending on either side\r\nof the upper mandible; also some fine cocks, with black skin, comb, and\r\nwattles, like those of Mozambique, which strutted about the lake shore.\r\n\r\nThus the zeal of these intelligent and brave men made every thing\r\nprosper. Providence, doubtless, assisted them; but, faithful to the\r\nprecept, they first helped themselves, and Heaven helped them\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the evenings, during this warm summer weather, after the day’s work\r\nwas ended, and when the sea breeze was springing up, the colonists\r\nloved to gather together on the edge of Prospect Plateau in an arbor of\r\nNeb’s building, covered with climbing plants. There they conversed and\r\ninstructed each other, and planned for the future; or the rough wit of\r\nthe sailor amused this little world, in which the most perfect harmony\r\nhad never ceased to reign.\r\n\r\nThey talked, too, of their country, dear and grand America. In what\r\ncondition was the Rebellion? It certainly could not have continued.\r\nRichmond had, doubtless, soon fallen into General Grant’s hands. The\r\ncapture of the Confederate capital was necessarily the last act in that\r\nunhappy struggle. By this time the North must have triumphed. How a\r\nnewspaper would have been welcomed by the colonists of Lincoln Island!\r\nIt was eleven months since all communication between them and the rest\r\nof the world had been interrupted, and pretty soon, the 24th of March,\r\nthe anniversary of the day when the balloon had thrown them on this\r\nunknown coast, would have arrived. Then they were castaways, struggling\r\nwith the elements for life. Now thanks to the knowledge of their\r\nleader, thanks to their own intelligence, they were true colonists,\r\nfurnished with arms, tools, instruments, who had turned to their use\r\nthe animals, vegetables and minerals of the island, the three kingdoms\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nAs to Smith, he listened to the conversation of his companions oftener\r\nthan he spoke himself. Sometimes he smiled at some thought of\r\nHerbert’s, or some sally of Pencroff’s, but always and above all other\r\nthings, he reflected upon those inexplicable events, upon that strange\r\nenigma whose secret still escaped him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD WEATHER—THE HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR—MAKING WINDOW GLASS AND TABLE\r\nWARE—THE BREAD TREE—FREQUENT VISITS TO THE CORRAL—THE INCREASE OF THE\r\nHERD—THE REPORTER’S QUESTION—THE EXACT POSITION OF LINCOLN\r\nISLAND—PENCROFF’S PROPOSAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather changed during the first week in March. There was a full\r\nmoon in the beginning of the month, and the heat was excessive. The\r\nelectricity in the air could be felt, and the stormy weather was at\r\nhand. On the 2d the thunder was very violent, the wind came out east,\r\nand the hail beat against the front of Granite House, pattering like a\r\nvolley of musketry. It was necessary to fasten the doors and shutters\r\nin order to keep the rooms from being inundated. Some of the hailstones\r\nwere as large as pigeons’ eggs, and made Pencroff think of his\r\ncornfield. He instantly ran there, and by covering the tiny young\r\nsprouts with a large cloth was able to protect them. The sailor was\r\nwell pelted, but he did not mind that.\r\n\r\nThe stormy weather lasted for eight days, and the thunder was almost\r\ncontinuous. The heavens were full of lightning, and many trees in the\r\nforest were struck, and also a huge pine growing upon the border of the\r\nlake. Two or three times the electric fluid struck the beach, melting\r\nand vitrifying the sand. Finding these fulgurites, Smith conceived the\r\nidea that it would be possible to furnish the windows of Granite House\r\nwith glass thick and solid enough to resist the wind and rain and hail.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, having no immediate out-of-doors work, profited by the\r\nbad weather to complete and perfect the interior arrangements of\r\nGranite House. The engineer built a lathe with which they were able to\r\nturn some toilette articles and cooking utensils, and also some\r\nbuttons, the need of which had been pressing. They also made a rack for\r\nthe arms, which were kept with the utmost care. Nor was Jup forgotten;\r\nhe occupied a chamber apart, a sort of cabin with a frame always full\r\nof good bedding, which suited him exactly.\r\n\r\n“There’s no such thing as fault-finding with Jup,” said Pencroff. “What\r\na servant he is, Neb!”\r\n\r\n“He is my pupil and almost my equal!”\r\n\r\n“He’s your superior,” laughed the sailor, “as you can talk, Neb, and he\r\ncannot!”\r\n\r\nJup had by this time become perfectly familiar with all the details of\r\nhis work. He brushed the clothes, turned the spit, swept the rooms,\r\nwaited at table, and—what delighted Pencroff—never laid down at night\r\nbefore he had tucked the worthy sailor in his bed.\r\n\r\nAs to the health of the colony, bipeds and bimana, quadrupeds and\r\nquadrumana, it left nothing to be desired. With the out-of-doors work,\r\non this salubrious soil, under this temperate zone, laboring with head\r\nand hand, they could not believe that they could ever be sick, and all\r\nwere in splendid health. Herbert had grown a couple of inches during\r\nthe year; his figure had developed and knitted together, and he\r\npromised to become a fine man physically and morally. He profited by\r\nthe lessons which he learned practically and from the books in the\r\nchest, and he found in the engineer and the reporter masters pleased to\r\nteach him. It was the engineer’s desire to teach the lad all he himself\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n“If I die,” thought Smith, “he will take my place.”\r\n\r\nThe storm ended on the 9th of March, but the sky remained clouded\r\nduring the remainder of the month, and, with the exception of two or\r\nthree fine days, rainy or foggy.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a little onager was born, and a number of moufflons, to\r\nthe great joy of Neb and Herbert, who had each their favorites among\r\nthese new comers.\r\n\r\nThe domestication of piccaries was also attempted—a pen being built\r\nnear the poultry-yard, and a number of the young animals placed therein\r\nunder Neb’s care. Jup was charged with taking them their daily\r\nnourishment, the kitchen refuse, and he acquitted himself\r\nconscientiously of the task. He did, indeed, cut off their tails, but\r\nthis was a prank and not naughtiness, because those little twisted\r\nappendages amused him like a toy, and his instinct was that of a child.\r\n\r\nOne day in March, Pencroff, talking with the engineer, recalled to his\r\nmind a promise made some time before.\r\n\r\n“You have spoken of something to take the place of our long ladder, Mr.\r\nSmith. Will you make it some day?”\r\n\r\n“You mean a kind of elevator?” answered Smith.\r\n\r\n“Call it an elevator if you wish,” responded the sailor. “The name does\r\nnot matter, provided we can get to our house easily.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is easier, Pencroff; but is it worth while?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, sir, it is. After we have the necessaries, let us think of\r\nthe conveniences. For people this will be a luxury, if you choose; but\r\nfor things, it is indispensable. It is not so easy to climb a long\r\nladder when one is heavily loaded.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Pencroff, we will try to satisfy you,” answered Smith.\r\n\r\n“But you haven’t the machine.”\r\n\r\n“We will make one.”\r\n\r\n“To go by steam?”\r\n\r\n“No, to go by water.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, a natural force was at hand. All that was necessary was to\r\nenlarge the passage which furnished Granite House with water, and make\r\na fall at the end of the corridor. Above this fall the engineer placed\r\na paddle-wheel, and wrapped around its axle a strong rope attached to a\r\nbasket. In this manner, by means of a long cord which reached to the\r\nground, they could raise or lower the basket by means of the hydraulic\r\nmotor.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of March the elevator was used for the first time, and\r\nafter that everything was hoisted into Granite House by its means. Top\r\nwas particularly pleased by this improvement, as he could not climb\r\nlike Jup, and he had often made the ascent on the back of Neb or of the\r\norang.\r\n\r\nSmith also attempted to make glass, which was difficult enough, but\r\nafter numerous attempts he succeeded in establishing a glass-works at\r\nthe old pottery, where Herbert and Spilett spent several days. The\r\nsubstances entering into the composition of glass—sand, chalk, and\r\nsoda—the engineer had at hand; but the “cane” of the glassmaker, an\r\niron tube five or six feet long, was wanting. This Pencroff, however,\r\nsucceeded in making, and on the 28th of March the furnace was heated.\r\n\r\nOne hundred parts of sand, thirty-five of chalk, forty of sulphate of\r\nsoda, mixed with two of three parts of powdered charcoal, composed the\r\nsubstance which was placed in earthen vessels and melted to a liquid,\r\nor rather to the consistency of paste. Smith “culled” a certain\r\nquantity of this paste with his cane, and turned it back and forth on a\r\nmetal plate so placed that it could be blown on; then he passed the\r\ncane to Herbert, telling him to blow in it.\r\n\r\n“As you do to make soap bubbles?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\nSo Herbert, puffing out his cheeks, blew through the cane, which he\r\nkept constantly turning about, in such a manner as to inflate the\r\nvitreous mass. Other quantities of the substance in fusion were added\r\nto the first, and the result was a bubble, measuring a foot in\r\ndiameter. Then Smith took the cane again, and swinging it like a\r\npendulum, he made this bubble lengthen into the shape of cylinder.\r\n\r\nThis cylinder was terminated at either end by two hemispherical caps,\r\nwhich were easily cut off by means of a sharp iron dipped in cold\r\nwater; in the same way the cylinder was cut lengthwise, and after\r\nhaving been heated a second time it was spread on the plate and\r\nsmoothed with a wooden roller.\r\n\r\nThus the first glass was made, and by repeating the operation fifty\r\ntimes they had as many glasses, and the windows of Granite House were\r\nsoon garnished with transparent panes, not very clear, perhaps, but\r\nclear enough.\r\n\r\nAs to the glassware, that was mere amusement. They took whatever shape\r\nhappened to come at the end of the cane. Pencroff had asked to be\r\nallowed to blow in his turn and he enjoyed it, but he blew so hard that\r\nhis products took the most diverting forms, which pleased him\r\namazingly.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the excursions undertaken about this time a new tree was\r\ndiscovered, whose products added much to the resources of the colony.\r\n\r\nSmith and Herbert, being out hunting one day, went into the forests of\r\nthe Far West, and as usual the lad asked the engineer a thousand\r\nquestions, and as Smith was no sportsman, and Herbert was deep in\r\nphysics and chemistry, the game did not suffer; and so it fell out that\r\nthe day was nearly ended, and the two hunters were likely to have made\r\na useless excursion, when Herbert, stopping suddenly, exclaimed\r\njoyfully:—\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Smith, do you see that tree?”\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed out a shrub rather than a tree, as it was composed of a\r\nsingle stem with a scaly bark, and leaves striped with small parallel\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n“It looks like a small palm. What is it?” asked Smith.\r\n\r\n“It is a “cycas revoluta,” about which I have read in our Dictionary of\r\nNatural History.”\r\n\r\n“But I see no fruit on this shrub?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, but its trunk contains a flour which Nature furnishes all\r\nground.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a bread-tree?”\r\n\r\n“That’s it, exactly.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my boy, since we are waiting for our wheat crop, this is a\r\nvaluable discovery. Examine it, and pray heaven you are not mistaken.”\r\n\r\nHerbert was not mistaken. He broke the stem of the cycas, which was\r\ncomposed of a glandular tissue containing a certain quantity of\r\nfarinaceous flour, traversed by ligneous fibres and separated by\r\nconcentric rings of the same substance. From the fecula oozed a sticky\r\nliquid of a disagreeable taste, but this could readily be removed by\r\npressure. The substance itself formed a real flour of superior quality,\r\nextremely nourishing, and which used to be forbidden exportation by the\r\nlaws of Japan.\r\n\r\nSmith and Herbert, after baring carefully noted the location of the\r\ncycas, returned to Granite House and made known their discovery, and\r\nthe next day all the colonists went to the place, and, Pencroff,\r\njubilant, asked the engineer:—\r\n\r\n“Mr Smith, do you believe there are such things as castaways’ islands?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Pencroff?.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean islands made especially for people to be shipwrecked\r\nupon, where the poor devils could always get along!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said the engineer, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Certainly!” answered the sailor, “and just as certainly Lincoln Island\r\nis one of them!”\r\n\r\nThey returned to Granite House with an ample supply of cycas stems, and\r\nthe engineer made a press by which the liquid was expelled, and they\r\nobtained a goodly quantity of flour which Neb transformed into cakes\r\nand puddings. They had not yet real wheaten bread, but it was the next\r\nthing to do.\r\n\r\nThe onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished a daily\r\nsupply of milk to the colony, and the cart, or rather a light wagon,\r\nwhich had taken its place, made frequent trips to the corral. And when\r\nPencroff’s turn came, he took Jup along, and made him drive, and Jup,\r\ncracking his whip, acquitted himself with his usual intelligence. Thus\r\neverything prospered, and the colonists, if they had not been so far\r\nfrom their country, would have had nothing to complain of. They liked\r\nthe life and they were so accustomed to the island that they would have\r\nleft it with regret. Nevertheless, such is man’s love of country, that\r\nhad a ship hove in sight the colonists would have signalled it, have\r\ngone aboard and departed. Meantime, they lived this happy life and they\r\nhad rather to fear than to wish for any interruption of its course.\r\n\r\nBut who is able to flatter himself that he has attained his fortune and\r\nreached the summit of his desires?\r\n\r\nThe colonists often discussed the nature of their Island, which they\r\nhad inhabited for more than a year, and one day a remark was made\r\nwhich, was destined, later, to bring about the most serious result.\r\n\r\nIt was the 1st of April, a Sunday, and the Pascal feast, which Smith\r\nand his companions had sanctified by rest and prayer. The day had been\r\nlovely, like a day in October in the Northern Hemisphere. Towards\r\nevening all were seated in the arbor on the edge of the plateau,\r\nwatching the gradual approach of night, and drinking some of Neb’s\r\nelderberry coffee. They had been talking of the island and its isolated\r\nposition in the Pacific, when something made Spilett say:—\r\n\r\n“By the way, Cyrus, have you ever taken the position of the island\r\nagain since you have had the sextant?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Well, wouldn’t it be well enough to do so?”.\r\n\r\n“What would be the use?” asked Pencroff. “The island is well enough\r\nwhere it is.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” answered Spilett, “but it is possible that the\r\nimperfections of the other instruments may have caused an error in that\r\nobservation, and since, it is easy to verify it exactly—”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Spilett,” responded the engineer, “and I would have\r\nmade this verification before, only that if I have made an error it\r\ncannot exceed five degrees in latitude or longitude.”\r\n\r\n“Who knows,” replied the reporter, “who knows but that we are much\r\nnearer an inhabited land than we believe?”\r\n\r\n“We will know to-morrow,” responded the engineer,” and had it not been\r\nfor the other work, which has left us no leisure, we would have known\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroff, “Mr. Smith is too good an observer to have been\r\nmistaken, and if the island has not moved, it is just where he put it!”\r\n\r\nSo the next day the engineer made the observations with the sextant\r\nwith the following result:—Longitude 150° 30’ west; latitude 34° 57’\r\nsouth. The previous observation had given the situation of the island\r\nas between longitude 150° and 155° west, and latitude 36° and 35°\r\nsouth, so that, notwithstanding the rudeness of his apparatus, Smith’s\r\nerror had not been more than five degrees.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Spilett, “since, beside a sextant, we have an atlas, see,\r\nmy dear Cyrus, the exact position of Lincoln Island in the Pacific.”\r\n\r\nHerbert brought the atlas, which it will be remembered gave the\r\nnomenclature in the French language, and the volume was opened at the\r\nmap of the Pacific. The engineer, compass in hand, was about to\r\ndetermine their situation, when, suddenly he paused, exclaiming:—\r\n\r\n“Why, there is an island marked in this part of the Pacific!”\r\n\r\n“An island?” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless it is ours.” added Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No.” replied Smith. “This island is situated in 153° of longitude and\r\n37° 11’ of latitude.”\r\n\r\n“And what’s the name?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“Is it important?”\r\n\r\n“No, it is an island lost in the Pacific, and which has never, perhaps,\r\nbeen visited.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, we will visit it,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“We?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to steer\r\nher. How far are we from this Tabor Island?”\r\n\r\n“A hundred and fifty miles to the northeast.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” responded Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Why in forty-eight hours, with a good breeze, we will be there!”\r\n\r\n“But what would be the use?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“We cannot tell till we see it!”\r\n\r\nAnd upon this response it was decided that a boat should be built so\r\nthat it might be launched by about the next October, on the return of\r\ngood weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIP BUILDING—THE SECOND HARVEST—AI HUNTING—A NEW PLANT—A WHALE—THE\r\nHARPOON FROM THE VINEYARD—CUTTING UP THIS CETACEA—USE OF THE\r\nWHALEBONE—THE END OF MAY—PENCROFF IS CONTENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Pencroff was possessed of an idea, he would not rest till it was\r\nexecuted. Now, he wanted to visit Tabor Island, and as a boat of some\r\nsize was necessary, therefore the boat must be built. He and the\r\nengineer accordingly determined upon the following model:—\r\n\r\nThe boat was to measure thirty-five feet on the keel by nine feet\r\nbeam—with the lines of a racer—and to draw six feet of water, which\r\nwould be sufficient to prevent her making leeway. She was to be\r\nflush-decked, with the two hatchways into two holds separated by a\r\npartition, and sloop-rigged with mainsail, topsail, jib, storm-jib and\r\nbrigantine, a rig easily handled, manageable in a squall, and excellent\r\nfor lying close in the wind. Her hull was to be constructed of planks,\r\nedge to edge, that is, not overlapping, and her timbers would be bent\r\nby steam after the planking had been adjusted to a false frame.\r\n\r\nOn the question of wood, whether to use elm or deal, they decided on\r\nthe latter as being easier to work, and supporting immersion in water\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nThese details having been arranged, it was decided that, as the fine\r\nweather would not return before six months, Smith and Pencroff should\r\ndo this work alone. Spilett and Herbert were to continue hunting, and\r\nNeb and his assistant, Master Jup, were to attend to the domestic cares\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\nAt once trees were selected and cut down and sawed into planks, and a\r\nweek later a ship-yard was made in the hollow between Granite House and\r\nthe Cliff, and a keel thirty-five feet long, with stern-post and stem\r\nlay upon the sand.\r\n\r\nSmith had not entered blindly upon this undertaking. He understood\r\nmarine construction as he did almost everything else, and he had first\r\ndrawn the model on paper. Moreover, he was well aided by Pencroff, who\r\nhad worked as a ship-carpenter. It was, therefore, only after deep\r\nthought and careful calculation that the false frame was raised on the\r\nkeel.\r\n\r\nPencroff was very anxious to begin the new enterprise, and but one\r\nthing took him away, and then only for a day, from the work. This was\r\nthe second harvest, which was made on the 15th of April. It resulted as\r\nbefore, and yielded the proportion of grains calculated.\r\n\r\n“Five bushels, Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff, after having scrupulously\r\nmeasured these riches.\r\n\r\n“Five bushels,” answered the engineer, “or 650,000 grains of corn.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we will sow them all this time, excepting a small reserve.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and if the next harvest is proportional to this we will have\r\n4,000 bushels.”\r\n\r\n“And we will eat bread.”\r\n\r\n“We will, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“But we must build a mill?”\r\n\r\n“We will build one.”\r\n\r\nThe third field of corn, though incomparably larger than the others,\r\nwas prepared with great care and received the precious seed. Then\r\nPencroff returned to his work.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood, or\r\nwith their guns loaded with ball, adventured into the unexplored depths\r\nof the Far West. It was an inextricable tangle of great trees growing\r\nclose together. The exploration of those thick masses was very\r\ndifficult and the engineer never undertook it without taking with him\r\nthe pocket compass, as the sun was rarely visible through the leaves.\r\nNaturally, game was not plenty in these thick undergrowths, but three\r\nai were shot during the last fortnight in April, and their skins were\r\ntaken to Granite House, where they received a sort of tanning with\r\nsulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, a discovery, valuable for another reason, was\r\nmade by Spilett. The two hunters were deep in the south-western part of\r\nthe Far West when the reporter, walking some fifty paces ahead of his\r\ncompanion, came to a sort of glade, and was surprised to perceive an\r\nodor proceeding from certain straight stemmed plants, cylindrical and\r\nbranching, and bearing bunches of flowers and tiny seeds. The reporter\r\nbroke off some of these stems, and, returning to the lad, asked him if\r\nhe knew what they were.\r\n\r\n“Where did you find this plant?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Over there in the glade; there is plenty of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this is a discovery that gives you Pencroff’s everlasting\r\ngratitude.”\r\n\r\n“Is it tobacco?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and if it is not first quality it is all the same, tobacco.”\r\n\r\n“Good Pencroff, how happy he’ll be. But he cannot smoke all. He’ll have\r\nto leave some for us.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what, sir. Let us say nothing to Pencroff until the\r\ntobacco has been prepared, and then some fine day we will hand him a\r\npipe full.”\r\n\r\n“And you may be sure, Herbert, that on that day the good fellow will\r\nwant nothing else in the world.”\r\n\r\nThe two smuggled a good supply of the plant into Granite House with as\r\nmuch precaution as if Pencroff had been the strictest of custom house\r\nofficers. Smith and Neb were let into the secret, but Pencroff never\r\nsuspected any thing during the two months it took to prepare the\r\nleaves, as he was occupied all day at the ship-yard.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May the sailor was again interrupted at his favorite work\r\nby a fishing adventure, in which all the colonists took part.\r\n\r\nFor some days they had noticed an enormous animal swimming in the sea\r\nsome two or three miles distant from the shore. It was a huge whale,\r\napparently belonging to the species _australis_, called “cape whales.”\r\n\r\n“How lucky for us if we could capture it!” cried the sailor. “Oh, if we\r\nonly had a suitable boat and a harpoon ready, so that I could\r\nsay:—Let’s go for him! For he’s worth all the trouble he’ll give us!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Pencroff, I should like to see you manage a harpoon. It must be\r\ninteresting.”\r\n\r\n“Interesting and somewhat dangerous,” said the engineer, “but since we\r\nhave not the means to attack this animal, it is useless to think about\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“I am astonished to see a whale in such comparatively high latitude.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Spilett, we are in that very part of the Pacific which\r\nwhalers call the ‘whale-field,’ and just here whales are found in the\r\ngreatest number.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said Pencroff, “and I wonder we have not seen one before,\r\nbut it don’t matter much since we cannot go to it.”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor turned with a sigh to his work, as all sailors are\r\nfishermen; and if the sport is proportionate to the size of the game,\r\none can imagine what a whaler must feel in the presence of a whale.\r\nBut, aside from the sport, such spoil would have been very acceptable\r\nto the colony, as the oil, the fat, and the fins could be turned to\r\nvarious uses.\r\n\r\nIt appeared as if the animal did not wish to leave these waters. He\r\nkept swimming about in Union Bay for two days, now approaching the\r\nshore, when his black body could be seen perfectly, and again darting\r\nthrough the water or spouting vapor to a vast height in the air. Its\r\npresence continually engaged the thoughts of the colonists, and\r\nPencroff was like a child longing for some forbidden object.\r\n\r\nFortune, however, did for the colonists what they could not have done\r\nfor themselves, and on the 3d of May, Neb looking from his kitchen\r\nshouted that the whale was aground on the island.\r\n\r\nHerbert and Spilett, who were about starting on a hunt, laid aside\r\ntheir guns, Pencroff dropped his hatchet, and Smith and Neb, joining\r\ntheir companions, hurried down to the shore. It had grounded on Jetsam\r\nPoint at high water, and it was not likely that the monster would be\r\nable to get off easily; but they must hasten in order to cut off its\r\nretreat if necessary. So seizing some picks and spears they ran across\r\nthe bridge, down the Mercy and along the shore, and in less than twenty\r\nminutes the party were beside the huge animal, above whom myriads of\r\nbirds were already hovering.\r\n\r\n“What a monster!” exclaimed Neb.\r\n\r\nAnd the term was proper, as it was one of the largest of the southern\r\nwhales, measuring forty-five feet in length and weighing not less than\r\n150,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nMeantime the animal, although the tide was still high, made no effort\r\nto get off the shore, and the reason for this was explained later when\r\nat low water the colonists walked around its body.\r\n\r\nIt was dead, and a harpoon protruded from its left flank.\r\n\r\n“Are there whalers in our neighborhood?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Why do you ask?”\r\n\r\n“Since the harpoon is still there—”\r\n\r\n“Oh that proves nothing, sir,” said Pencroff. “Whales sometimes go\r\nthousands of miles with a harpoon in them, and I should not be\r\nsurprised if this one which came to die here had been struck in the\r\nNorth Atlantic.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless”—began Spilett, not satisfied with Pencroff’s\r\naffirmation.\r\n\r\n“It is perfectly possible,” responded the engineer, “but let us look at\r\nthe harpoon. Probably it will have the name of the ship on it.”\r\n\r\nPencroff drew out the harpoon, and read this inscription:—\r\n\r\nMaria-Stella Vineyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n“A ship from the Vineyard! A ship of my country!” be cried. “The\r\nMaria-Stella! a good whaler! and I know her well! Oh, my friends, a\r\nship from the Vineyard! A whaler from the Vineyard!”\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor, brandishing the harpoon, continued to repeat that name\r\ndear to his heart, the name of his birthplace.\r\n\r\nBut as they could not wait for the Maria-Stella to come and reclaim\r\ntheir prize, the colonists resolved to cut it up before decomposition\r\nset in. The birds of prey were already anxious to become possessors of\r\nthe spoil, and it was necessary to drive them away with gunshots.\r\n\r\nThe whale was a female, and her udders furnished a great quantity of\r\nmilk, which, according to Dieffenbach, resembles in taste, color, and\r\ndensity, the milk of cows.\r\n\r\nAs Pencroff had served on a whaler he was able to direct the\r\ndisagreeable work of cutting up the animal—an operation which lasted\r\nduring three days. The blubber, cut in strips two feet and a half thick\r\nand divided into pieces weighing a thousand pounds each, was melted\r\ndown in large earthen vats, which had been brought on to the ground.\r\nAnd such was its abundance, that notwithstanding a third of its weight\r\nwas lost by melting, the tongue alone yielded 6,000 pounds of oil. The\r\ncolonists were therefore supplied with an abundant supply of stearine\r\nand glycerine, and there was, besides, the whalebone, which would find\r\nits use, although there were neither umbrellas nor corsets in Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe operation ended, to the great satisfaction of the colonists, the\r\nrest of the animal was left to the birds, who made away with it to the\r\nlast vestiges, and the daily routine of work was resumed. Still, before\r\ngoing to the ship-yard, Smith worked on certain affairs which excited\r\nthe curiosity of his companions. He took a dozen of the plates of\r\nbaleen (the solid whalebone), which he cut into six equal lengths,\r\nsharpened at the ends.\r\n\r\n“And what is that for?” asked Herbert, when they were finished.\r\n\r\n“To kill foxes, wolves, and jaguars,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Now?”\r\n\r\n“No, but this winter, when we have the ice.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“You shall understand, my lad,” answered the engineer. “This is not my\r\ninvention; it is frequently employed by the inhabitants of the Aleutian\r\nislands. These whalebones which you see, when the weather is freezing I\r\nwill bend round and freeze in that position with a coating of ice; then\r\nhaving covered them with a bit of fat, I will place them in the snow.\r\nSupposing a hungry animal swallows one of these baits? The warmth will\r\nthaw the ice, and the whalebone, springing back, will pierce the\r\nstomach.”\r\n\r\n“That is ingenious!” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“And it will save powder and ball,” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“It will be better than the traps.”\r\n\r\n“Just wait till winter comes.”\r\n\r\nThe ship-building continued, and towards the end of the month the\r\nlittle vessel was half-finished. Pencroff worked almost too hard, but\r\nhis companions were secretly preparing a recompense for all his toil,\r\nand the 31st of May was destined to be one of the happiest times in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner on that day, just as he was leaving table, Pencroff felt a\r\nhand on his shoulder and heard Spilett saying to him:—\r\n\r\n“Don’t go yet awhile, Pencroff. You forget the dessert.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Spilett, but I must get back to work.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, have a cup of coffee.”\r\n\r\n“Not any.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, a pipe?”\r\n\r\nPencroff started up quickly, and when he saw the reporter holding him a\r\npipe full of tobacco, and Herbert with a light, his honest, homely face\r\ngrew pale, and he could not say a word; but taking the pipe, he placed\r\nit to his lips, lit it, and drew five or six long puffs, one after the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA fragrant, blueish-colored smoke filled the air, and from the depths\r\nof this cloud came a voice, delirious with joy, repeating,\r\n\r\n“Tobacco! real tobacco!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pencroff,” answered Smith, “and good tobacco at that.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven be praised!” ejaculated the sailor. “Nothing now is wanting in\r\nour island. And he puffed and puffed and puffed.\r\n\r\n“Who found it?” he asked, at length. “It was you, Herbert, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff, it was Mr. Spilett.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Spilett!” cried the sailor, hugging the reporter, who had never\r\nbeen treated that way before.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pencroff,”—taking advantage of a cessation in the embrace to get\r\nhis breath—“But include in your thanksgiving Herbert, who recognized\r\nthe plant, Mr. Smith, who prepared it, and Neb, who has found it hard\r\nto keep the secret.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my friends, I will repay you for this some day! Meanwhile I am\r\neternally grateful!.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER—FULLING CLOTH—THE MILL —PENCROFF’S FIXED PURPOSE—THE\r\nWHALEBONES—THE USE OF AN ALBATROSS —TOP AND JUP—STORMS—DAMAGE TO THE\r\nPOULTRY-YARD—AN EXCURSION TO THE MARSH—SMITH ALONE—EXPLORATION OF THE\r\nPITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter came with June, and the principal work was the making of strong\r\nwarm clothing. The moufflons had been clipped, and the question was how\r\nto transform the wool into cloth.\r\n\r\nSmith, not having any mill machinery, was obliged to proceed in the\r\nsimplest manner, in order to economize the spinning and weaving.\r\nTherefore he proposed to make use of the property possessed by the\r\nfilaments of wool of binding themselves together under pressure, and\r\nmaking by their mere entanglement the substance known as felt. This\r\nfelt can be obtained by a simple fulling, an operation which, while it\r\ndiminishes the suppleness of the stuff, greatly augments its\r\nheat-preserving qualities; and as the moufflons’ wool was very short it\r\nwas in good condition for felting.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, assisted by his companions, including Pencroff—who had to\r\nleave his ship again—cleansed the wool of the grease and oil by soaking\r\nit in warm water and washing it with soda, and, when it was partially\r\ndried by pressure it was in a condition to be milled, that is, to\r\nproduce a solid stuff, too coarse to be of any value in the industrial\r\ncentres of Europe, but valuable enough in the Lincoln Island market.\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s professional knowledge was of great service in\r\nconstructing the machine destined to mill the wool, as he knew how to\r\nmake ready use of the power, unemployed up to this time, in the\r\nwater-fall at the cliff, to move a fulling mill.\r\n\r\nIts construction was most simple. A tree furnished with cams, which\r\nraised and dropped the vertical millers, troughs for the wool, into\r\nwhich the millers fell, a strong wooden building containing and\r\nsustaining the contrivance, such was the machine in question.\r\n\r\nThe work, superintended by Smith, resulted admirably. The wool,\r\npreviously impregnated with a soapy solution, came from the mill in the\r\nshape of a thick felt cloth. The striæ and roughnesses of the material\r\nhad caught and blended together so thoroughly that they formed a stuff\r\nequally suitable for cloths or coverings. It was not, indeed, one of\r\nthe stuffs of commerce, but it was “Lincoln felt,” and the island had\r\none more industry.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, being thus provided with good clothes and warm\r\nbed-clothing, saw the winter of 1866-67 approach without any dread. The\r\ncold really began to be felt on the 20th of June, and, to his great\r\nregret, Pencroff was obliged to suspend work on his vessel, although it\r\nwould certainly be finished by the next spring.\r\n\r\nThe fixed purpose of the sailor was to make a voyage of discovery to\r\nTabor Island, although Smith did not approve of this voyage of simple\r\ncuriosity, as there was evidently no succor to be obtained from that\r\ndesert and half arid rock. A voyage of 150 miles in a boat,\r\ncomparatively small, in the midst of unknown seas, was cause for\r\nconsiderable anxiety. If the frail craft, once at sea, should be unable\r\nto reach Tabor Island, or to return to Lincoln Island, what would\r\nbecome of her in the midst of this ocean so fertile in disasters?\r\n\r\nSmith often talked of this project with Pencroff, and he found in the\r\nsailor a strange obstinacy to make the voyage, an obstinacy for which\r\nPencroff himself could not account.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the engineer one day, “you must see, Pencroff, after\r\nhaving said every good of Lincoln Island, and expressing the regret you\r\nwould feel should you have to leave it, that you are the first to want\r\nto get away.”\r\n\r\n“Only for a day or two,” answered Pencroff, “for a few days, Mr. Smith;\r\njust long enough to go and return, and see what this island is.”\r\n\r\n“But it cannot compare with ours.”\r\n\r\n“I know that.””\r\n\r\n“Then why go?”\r\n\r\n“To find out what’s going on there!”\r\n\r\n“But there is nothing; there can be nothing there.”\r\n\r\n“Who knows?”\r\n\r\n“And supposing you are caught in a storm?”\r\n\r\n“That is not likely in that season,” replied Pencroff. “But, sir, as it\r\nis necessary to foresee everything, I want your permission to take\r\nHerbert with me.”\r\n\r\n“Pencroff,” said the engineer, laying his hand on the shoulder of the\r\nsailor, “If anything should happen to you and this child, whom chance\r\nhas made our son, do you think that we would ever forgive ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” responded Pencroff with unshaken confidence, “we won’t\r\ndiscuss such mishaps. But we will talk again of this voyage when the\r\ntime comes. Then, I think, when you have seen our boat well rigged,\r\nwhen you have seen how well she behaves at sea, when you have made the\r\ntour of the island—as we will, together—I think, I say, that you will\r\nnot hesitate to let me go. I do not conceal from you that this will be\r\na fine work, your ship.”\r\n\r\n“Say rather, our ship, Pencroff,” replied the engineer, momentarily\r\ndisarmed. And the conversation, to be renewed later, ended without\r\nconvincing either of the speakers.\r\n\r\nThe first snow fell towards the end of the month. The corral had been\r\nwell provisioned, and there was no further necessity for daily visits,\r\nbut it was decided to go there at least once a week. The traps were set\r\nagain, and the contrivances of Smith were tried, and worked perfectly.\r\nThe bent whalebones, frozen, and covered with fat, were placed near the\r\nedge of the forest, at a place frequented by animals, and some dozen\r\nfoxes, some wild boars, and a jaguar were found killed by this means,\r\ntheir stomachs perforated by the straightened whalebones.\r\n\r\nAt this time, an experiment, thought of by the reporter, was made. It\r\nwas the first attempt of the colonists to communicate with their\r\nkindred.\r\n\r\nSpilett had already often thought of throwing a bottle containing a\r\nwriting into the sea, to be carried by the currents, perhaps, to some\r\ninhabited coast, or to make use of the pigeons. But it was pure folly\r\nto seriously believe that pigeons or bottles could cross the 1,200\r\nmiles separating the island from all lands.—\r\n\r\nBut on the 30th of June they captured, not without difficulty, an\r\nalbatross, which Herbert had slightly wounded in the foot. It was a\r\nsplendid specimen of its kind, its wings measuring ten feet from tip to\r\ntip, and it could cross seas as vast as the Pacific.\r\n\r\nHerbert would have liked to have kept the bird and tamed it, but\r\nSpilett made him understand that they could not afford to neglect this\r\nchance of corresponding by means of this courier with the Pacific\r\ncoasts. So Herbert gave up the bird, as, if it had come from some\r\ninhabited region, it was likely to return there if at liberty.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, in his heart, Spilett, to whom the journalistic spirit\r\nreturned sometimes, did not regret giving to the winds an interesting\r\narticle relating the adventures of the colonists of Lincoln Island.\r\nWhat a triumph for the reporters of the New York _Herald_, and for the\r\nissue containing the chronicle, if ever the latter should reach his\r\ndirector, the honorable John Bennett!\r\n\r\nSpilett, therefore, wrote out a succinct article, which was enclosed in\r\na waterproof-cloth bag, with the request to whoever found it to send it\r\nto one of the offices of the _Herald_. This little bag was fastened\r\naround the neck of the albatross and the bird given its freedom, and it\r\nwas not without emotion that the colonists saw this rapid courier of\r\nthe air disappear in the western clouds.\r\n\r\n“Where does he go that way?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Towards New Zealand,” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“May he have a good voyage,” said the sailor, who did not expect much\r\nfrom this method of communication.\r\n\r\nWith the winter, in-door work was resumed; old clothes were repaired,\r\nnew garments made, and the sails of the sloop made from the\r\ninexhaustible envelope of the balloon. During July the cold was\r\nintense, but coal and wood were abundant, and Smith had built another\r\nchimney in the great hall, where they passed the long evenings. It was\r\na great comfort to the colonists, when, seated in this well-lighted and\r\nwarm hall, a good dinner finished, coffee steaming in the cups, the\r\npipes emitting a fragrant smoke, they listened to the roar of the\r\ntempest without. They were perfectly comfortable, if that is possible\r\nwhere one is far from his kindred and without possible means of\r\ncommunicating with them. They talked about their country, of their\r\nfriends at home, of the grandeur of the republic, whose influence must\r\nincrease; and Smith, who had had much to do with the affairs of the\r\nUnion, entertained his hearers with his stories, his perceptions and\r\nhis prophecies.\r\n\r\nOne evening as they had been sitting talking in this way for some time,\r\nthey were interrupted by Top, who began barking in that peculiar way\r\nwhich had previously attracted the attention of the engineer, and\r\nrunning around the mouth of the well which opened at the end of the\r\ninner corridor.\r\n\r\n“Why is Top barking that way again?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“And Jup growling so?” added Herbert.\r\n\r\nIndeed, both the dog and the orang gave unequivocal signs of agitation,\r\nand curiously enough these two animals seemed to be more alarmed than\r\nirritated.\r\n\r\nIt is evident,” said Spilett, “that this well communicates directly\r\nwith the sea, and that some animal comes to breathe in its depths.”\r\n\r\n“It must be so, since there is no other explanation to give. Be quiet,\r\nTop! and you, Jup! go to your room.”\r\n\r\nThe animals turned away, Jup went to his bed, but Top remained in the\r\nhall, and continued whining the remainder of the evening. It was not,\r\nhowever, the question of this incident that darkened the countenance of\r\nthe engineer.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the month, rain and snow alternated, and though\r\nthe temperature was not as low as during the preceding winter, there\r\nwere more storms and gales. On more than one occasion the Chimneys had\r\nbeen threatened by the waves, and it seemed as if an upraising of the\r\nsea, caused by some submarine convulsion, raised the monstrous billows\r\nand hurled them against Granite House.\r\n\r\nDuring these storms it was difficult, even dangerous, to attempt using\r\nthe roads on the island, as the trees were falling constantly.\r\nNevertheless, the colonists never let a week pass without visiting the\r\ncorral, and happily this enclosure, protected by the spur of the\r\nmountain, did not suffer from the storms. But the poultry-yard, from\r\nits position, exposed to the blast, suffered considerable damage. Twice\r\nthe pigeon-house was unroofed, and the fence also was demolished,\r\nmaking it necessary to rebuild it more solidly. It was evident that\r\nLincoln Island was situated in the worst part of the Pacific. Indeed,\r\nit seemed as if the island formed the central point of vast cyclones\r\nwhich whipped it as if it were a top; only in this case the top was\r\nimmovable and the whip spun about.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week in August the storm abated, and the atmosphere\r\nrecovered a calm which it seemed never to have lost. With the calm the\r\ntemperature lowered, and the thermometer of the colonists indicated 8°\r\nbelow zero.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of August, an excursion, which had been planned for some time\r\nwas made to Tadorn’s Fen. The hunters were tempted by the great number\r\nof aquatic birds which made these marshes their home, and not only\r\nSpilett and Herbert, but Pencroff and Neb took part in the expedition.\r\nSmith alone pleaded some excuse for remaining behind at Granite House.\r\n\r\nThe hunters promised to return by evening. Top and Jup accompanied\r\nthem. And when they had crossed the bridge over the Mercy the engineer\r\nleft them, and returned with the idea of executing a project in which\r\nhe wished to be alone. This was to explore minutely the well opening\r\ninto the corridor.\r\n\r\nWhy did Top run round this place so often? Why did he whine in that\r\nstrange way? Why did Jup share Top’s anxiety? Had this well other\r\nbranches beside the communication with the sea? Did it ramify towards\r\nother portions of the island? This is what Smith wanted to discover,\r\nand, moreover, to be alone in his discovery. He had resolved to make\r\nthis exploration during the absence of his companions, and here was the\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by means of the\r\nladder, which had not been used since the elevator had taken its place.\r\nThe engineer dragged this ladder to the opening of the well, and,\r\nhaving made fast one end, let it unroll itself into the abyss. Then,\r\nhaving lit a lantern, and placing a revolver and cutlass in his belt,\r\nhe began to descend the rungs. The sides of the well were smooth, but\r\nsome projections of rocks appeared at intervals, and by means of these\r\nprojections an athlete could have raised himself to the mouth of the\r\nwell. The engineer noticed this, but in throwing the light of the\r\nlantern on these points he could discover nothing to indicate that they\r\nhad ever been used in that way.\r\n\r\nSmith descended deeper, examining every part of the well, but he saw\r\nnothing suspicious. When he had reached the lowermost rung, he was at\r\nthe surface of the water, which was perfectly calm. Neither there, nor\r\nin any other part of the well, was there any lateral opening. The wall,\r\nstruck by the handle of Smith’s cutlass, sounded solid. It was a\r\ncompact mass, through which no human being could make his way. In order\r\nto reach the bottom of the well, and from thence climb to its mouth, it\r\nwas necessary to traverse the submerged passage under the shore, which\r\nconnected with the sea, and this was only possible for marine animals.\r\nAs to knowing whereabouts on the shore, and at what depth under the\r\nwaves, this passage came out, that was impossible to discover.\r\n\r\nSmith, having ended his exploration, remounted the ladder, covered over\r\nagain the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the great\r\nhall of Granite House, saying to himself:—\r\n\r\n“I have seen nothing, and yet, there is something there.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGGING THE LAUNCH—ATTACKED BY FOXES—JUP WOUNDED—JUP NURSED—JUP\r\nCURED—COMPLETION OF THE LAUNCH—PENCROFF’S TRIUMPH—THE GOOD LUCK—TRIAL\r\nTRIP, TO THE SOUTH OF THE ISLAND—AN UNEXPECTED DOCUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same evening the hunters returned, fairly loaded down with game,\r\nthe four men having all they could carry. Top had a circlet of ducks\r\nround his neck, and Jup belts of woodcock round his body.\r\n\r\n“See, my master,” cried Neb, “see how we have used our time. Preserves,\r\npies, we will have a good reserve! But some one must help me, and I\r\ncount upon you, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\n“No, Neb,” responded the sailor, “the rigging of the launch occupies my\r\ntime, and you will have to do without me.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Master Herbert?”\r\n\r\n“I, Neb, must go to-morrow to the corral.”\r\n\r\n“Then will you help me, Mr. Spilett?”\r\n\r\n“To oblige you, I will, Neb,” answered the reporter, “but I warn you\r\nthat if you discover your recipes to me I will publish them.”\r\n\r\n“Whenever you choose, sir,” responded Neb; “whenever you choose.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the next day the reporter was installed as Neb’s aid in his\r\nculinary laboratory. But beforehand the engineer had given him the\r\nresult of the previous day’s exploration, and Spilett agreed with Smith\r\nin his opinion that, although he had found out nothing, still there was\r\na secret to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe cold continued a week longer, and the colonists did not leave\r\nGranite House excepting to look after the poultry-yard. The dwelling\r\nwas perfumed by the good odors which the learned manipulations of Neb\r\nand the reporter emitted; but all the products of the hunt in the fen\r\nhad not been made into preserves, and as the game kept perfectly in the\r\nintense cold, wild ducks and others, were eaten fresh, and declared\r\nbetter than any waterfowl in the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the week, Pencroff, assisted by Herbert, who used the sailor’s\r\nneedle skilfully, worked with such diligence that the sails of the\r\nlaunch were finished. Thanks to the rigging which had been recovered\r\nwith the envelope of the balloon, hemp cordage was not wanting. The\r\nsails were bordered by strong bolt-ropes, and there was enough left to\r\nmake halliards, shrouds, and sheets. The pulleys were made by Smith on\r\nthe lathe which he had set up, acting under Pencroff’s instruction. The\r\nrigging was, therefore, completed before the launch was finished.\r\nPencroff made a red, white, and blue flag, getting the dye from certain\r\nplants; but to the thirty-seven stars representing the thirty-seven\r\nStates of the Union, the sailor added another star, the star of the\r\n“State of Lincoln:” as he considered his island as already annexed to\r\nthe great republic.\r\n\r\n“And,” said he, “it is in spirit, if it is not in fact!”\r\n\r\nFor the present the flag was unfurled from the central window of\r\nGranite House and saluted with three cheers.\r\n\r\nMeantime, they had reached the end of the cold season; and it seemed as\r\nif this second winter would pass without any serious event, when during\r\nthe night of the 11th of August, Prospect Plateau was menaced by a\r\ncomplete devastation. After a busy day the colonists were sleeping\r\nsoundly, when towards 4 o’clock in the morning, they were suddenly\r\nawakened by Top’s barking. The dog did not bark this time at the mouth\r\nof the pit, but at the door, and he threw himself against it as if he\r\nwished to break it open. Jup, also, uttered sharp cries.\r\n\r\n“Be quiet, Top!” cried Neb, who was the first awake.\r\n\r\nBut the dog only barked the louder.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” cried Smith. And every one dressing in haste,\r\nhurried to the windows and opened them.\r\n\r\n“Beneath them a fall of snow shone white through the darkness. The\r\ncolonists could see nothing, but they heard curious barkings\r\npenetrating the night. It was evident that the shore had been invaded\r\nby a number of animals which they could not see.”\r\n\r\n“What can they be?” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Wolves, jaguars, or monkeys!” replied Neb.\r\n\r\n“The mischief! They can get on to the plateau!” exclaimed the reporter.\r\n\r\n“And our poultry-yard, and our garden!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“How have they got in?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“They have come through the causeway,” answered the engineer, “which\r\none of us must have forgotten to close!”\r\n\r\n“In truth,” said Spilett, “I remember that I left it open—”\r\n\r\n“A nice mess you have made of it, sir!” cried the sailor.\r\n\r\n“What is done, is done,” replied Spilett. “Let us consider what it is\r\nnecessary to do!”\r\n\r\nThese questions and answers passed rapidly between Smith and his\r\ncompanions. It was certain that the causeway had been passed, that the\r\nshore had been invaded by animals, and that, whatever they were, they\r\ncould gain Prospect Plateau by going up the left bank of the Mercy. It\r\nwas, therefore, necessary quickly to overtake them, and, if necessary,\r\nto fight them!\r\n\r\n“But what are they?” somebody asked a second time, as the barking\r\nresounded more loudly.\r\n\r\nHerbert started at the sound, and he remembered having heard it during\r\nhis first visit to the sources of Red Creek.\r\n\r\n“They are foxes! they are foxes!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” cried the sailor. And all, armed with hatchets, carbines,\r\nand revolvers, hurried into the elevator, and were soon on the shore.\r\n\r\nThese foxes are dangerous animals, when numerous or irritated by\r\nhunger. Nevertheless, the colonists did not hesitate to throw\r\nthemselves into the midst of the band, and their first shots, darting\r\nbright gleams through the darkness, drove back the foremost assailants.\r\n\r\nIt was most important to prevent these thieves from gaining Prospect\r\nPlateau, as the garden and the poultry-yard would have been at their\r\nmercy, and the result would have been immense, perhaps, irreparable\r\ndamage, especially to the corn-field. But as the plateau could only be\r\ninvaded by the left bank of the Mercy, it would suffice to oppose a\r\nbarrier to the foxes on the narrow portion of the shore comprised\r\nbetween the river and the granite wall.\r\n\r\nThis was apparent to all, and under Smith’s direction the party gained\r\nthis position and disposed themselves so as to form an impassable line.\r\nTop, his formidable jaws open, preceded the colonists, and was followed\r\nby Jup, armed with a knotty cudgel, which he brandished like a\r\ncricket-bat.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark, and it was only by the flash of the discharges\r\nthat the colonists could perceive their assailants, who numbered at\r\nleast 100, and whose eyes shone like embers.\r\n\r\n“They must not pass!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“They shall not pass!” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\nBut if they did not it was not because they did not try. Those behind\r\nkept pushing on those in front, and it was an incessant struggle; the\r\ncolonists using their hatchets and revolvers. Already the dead bodies\r\nof the foxes were strewn over the ground, but the band did not seem to\r\nlessen; and it appeared as if reinforcements were constantly pouring in\r\nthrough the causeway on the shore. Meantime the colonists fought side\r\nby side, receiving some wounds, though happily but trifling. Herbert\r\nshot one fox, which had fastened itself on Neb like a tiger-cat. Top\r\nfought with fury, springing at the throats of the animals and\r\nstrangling them at once. Jup, armed with his cudgel, laid about him\r\nlike a good fellow, and it was useless to try to make him stay behind.\r\nGifted, doubtless, with a sight able to pierce the darkness, he was\r\nalways in the thick of the fight, uttering from time to time a sharp\r\ncry, which was with him a mark of extreme jollification. At one time he\r\nadvanced so far, that by the flash of a revolver he was seen,\r\nsurrounded by five or six huge foxes, defending himself with rare\r\ncoolness.\r\n\r\nAt length the fight ended in a victory for the colonists, but only\r\nafter two hours of resistance. Doubtless the dawn of day determined the\r\nretreat of the foxes, who scampered off toward the north across the\r\ndrawbridge, which Neb ran at once to raise. When daylight lit the\r\nbattlefield, the colonists counted fifty dead bodies upon the shore.\r\n\r\n“And Jup! Where is Jup?” cried Neb.\r\n\r\nJup had disappeared. His friend Neb called him, and for the first time\r\nhe did not answer the call. Every one began to search for the monkey,\r\ntrembling lest they should find him among the dead. At length, under a\r\nveritable mound of carcasses, each one marked by the terrible cudgel of\r\nthe brave animal, they found Jup. The poor fellow still held in his\r\nhand the handle of his broken weapon; but deprived of this arm, he had\r\nbeen overpowered by numbers, and deep wounds scored his breast.\r\n\r\n“He’s alive!” cried Neb, who knelt beside him.\r\n\r\n“And we will save him,” answered the sailor, “We will nurse him as one\r\nof ourselves!”\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if Jup understood what was said, for he laid his head on\r\nPencroff’s shoulder as if to thank him. The sailor himself was wounded,\r\nbut his wounds, like those of his companions, were trifling, as thanks\r\nto their firearms, they had always been able to keep the assailants at\r\na distance. Only the orang was seriously hurt.\r\n\r\nJup, borne by Neb and Pencroff, was carried to the elevator, and lifted\r\ngently to Granite House. There he was laid upon one of the beds, and\r\nhis wounds carefully washed. No vital organ seemed to have been\r\ninjured, but the orang was very feeble from loss of blood, and a strong\r\nfever had set in. His wounds having been dressed, a strict diet was\r\nimposed upon him, “just as for a real person,” Neb said, and they gave\r\nhim a refreshing draught made from herbs.\r\n\r\nHe slept at first but brokenly, but little by little, his breathing\r\nbecame more regular, and they left him in a heavy sleep. From time to\r\ntime Top came “on tip-toe” to visit his friend, and seemed to approve\r\nof the attentions which had been bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\nOne of Jup’s hands hung over the side of the bed, and Top licked it\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\nThe same morning they disposed of the dead foxes by dragging the bodies\r\nto the Far West and burying them there.\r\n\r\nThis attack, which might have been attended with very grave results,\r\nwas a lesson to the colonists, and thenceforth they never slept before\r\nhaving ascertained that all the bridges were raised and that no\r\ninvasion was possible.\r\n\r\nMeantime Jup, after having given serious alarm for some days, began to\r\ngrow better. The fever abated gradually, and Spilett, who was something\r\nof a physician, considered him out of danger. On the 16th of August Jup\r\nbegan to eat. Neb made him some nice, sweet dishes, which the invalid\r\nswallowed greedily, for if he had a fault, it was that he was a bit of\r\na glutton, and Neb had never done anything to correct this habit.\r\n\r\n“What would you have?” he said to Spilett, who sometimes rebuked the\r\nnegro for indulging him. “Poor Jup has no other pleasure than to eat!\r\nand I am only too glad to be able to reward his services in this way!”\r\n\r\nBy the 21st of August he was about again. His wounds were healed, and\r\nthe colonists saw that he would soon recover his accustomed suppleness\r\nand vigor. Like other convalescents he was seized with an excessive\r\nhunger, and the reporter let him eat what he wished, knowing that the\r\nmonkey’s instinct would preserve him from excess. Neb was overjoyed to\r\nsee his pupil’s appetite returned.\r\n\r\n“Eat Jup,” he said, “and you shall want for nothing. You have shed your\r\nblood for us, and it is right that I should help you to make it again!”\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 25th of August, the colonists seated in the great\r\nhall, were called by Neb to Jup’s room.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Look!” answered Neb, laughing, and what did they see but Jup, seated\r\nlike a Turk within the doorway of Granite House, tranquilly and gravely\r\nsmoking!\r\n\r\n“My pipe!” cried Pencroff. “He has taken my pipe! Well, Jup, I give it\r\nto you. Smoke on my friend, smoke on!”\r\n\r\nAnd Jup gravely puffed on, seeming to experience the utmost enjoyment.\r\n\r\nSmith was not greatly astonished at this incident, and he cited\r\nnumerous examples of tamed monkeys that had become accustomed to the\r\nuse of tobacco.\r\n\r\nAnd after this day master Jup had his own pipe hung in his room beside\r\nhis tobacco-bag, and, lighting it himself with a live coal, he appeared\r\nto be the happiest of quadrumana. It seemed as if this community of\r\ntaste drew closer together the bonds of friendship already existing\r\nbetween the worthy monkey and the honest sailor.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he is a man,” Pencroff would sometimes say to Neb. “Would it\r\nastonish you if some day he was to speak?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed it would not,” replied Neb. “The wonder is that he don’t do it,\r\nas that is all he lacks!”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, it would be funny if some fine day he said to\r\nme:—Pencroff, suppose we change pipes!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” responded Neb. “What a pity he was born mute!”\r\n\r\nWinter ended with September, and the work was renewed with ardor. The\r\nconstruction of the boat advanced rapidly. The planking was completed,\r\nand as wood was plenty Pencroff proposed that they line the interior\r\nwith a stout ceiling, which would insure the solidity of the craft.\r\nSmith, not knowing what might be in store for them, approved the\r\nsailor’s idea of making his boat as strong as possible. The ceiling and\r\nthe deck were finished towards the 13th of September. For caulking,\r\nthey used some dry wrack, and the seams were then covered with boiling\r\npitch, made from the pine trees of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the boat was simple. She had been ballasted with\r\nheavy pieces of granite, set in a bed of lime, and weighing 12,000\r\npounds. A deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was\r\ndivided into two compartments, the larger containing two bunks, which\r\nserved as chests. The foot of the mast was at the partition separating\r\nthe compartments, which were entered through hatchways.\r\n\r\nPencroff had no difficulty in finding a tree suitable for a mast. He\r\nchose a young straight fir, without knots, so that all he had to do was\r\nto square the foot and round it off at the head. All the iron work had\r\nbeen roughly but solidly made at the Chimneys; and in the first week of\r\nOctober yards, topmast, spars, oars, etc., everything, in short, was\r\ncompleted; and it was determined that they would first try the craft\r\nalong the shores of the island, so as to see how she acted.\r\n\r\nShe was launched on the 10th of October. Pencroff was radiant with\r\ndelight. Completely rigged, she had been pushed on rollers to the edge\r\nof the shore, and, as the tide rose, she was floated on the surface of\r\nthe water, amid the applause of the colonists, and especially of\r\nPencroff, who showed no modesty on this occasion. Moreover, his vanity\r\nlooked beyond the completion of the craft, as, now that she was built,\r\nhe was to be her commander. The title of captain was bestowed upon him\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy Captain Pencroff it was necessary at once to name\r\nhis ship, and after considerable discussion they decided upon Good\r\nLuck—the name chosen by the honest sailor. Moreover, as the weather was\r\nfine, the breeze fresh, and the sea calm, the trial must be made at\r\nonce in an excursion along the coast.\r\n\r\n“Get aboard! Get aboard!” cried Captain Pencroff.\r\n\r\nAt half-past 10, after having eaten breakfast and put some provisions\r\naboard, everybody, including Top and Jup, embarked, the sails were\r\nhoisted, the flag set at the masthead, and the Good Luck, with Pencroff\r\nat the helm, stood out to sea.\r\n\r\nOn going out from Union Bay they had a fair wind, and they were able to\r\nsee that, sailing before it, their speed was excellent. After doubling\r\nJetsam Point and Claw Cape, Pencroff had to lie close to the wind in\r\norder to skirt along the shore, and he observed the Good Luck would\r\nsail to within five points of the wind, and that she made but little\r\nlee-way. She sailed very well, also, before the wind, minding her helm\r\nperfectly, and gained even in going about.\r\n\r\nThe passengers were enchanted. They had a good boat, which, in case of\r\nneed, could render them great service, and in this splendid weather,\r\nwith the fair wind, the sail was delightful. Pencroff stood out to sea\r\ntwo or three miles, opposite Balloon Harbor, and then the whole varied\r\npanorama of the island from Claw Cape to Reptile Promontory was visible\r\nunder a new aspect. In the foreground were the pine forests,\r\ncontrasting with the foliage of the other trees, and over all rose Mt.\r\nFranklin, its head white with snow.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful it is!” exclaimed Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, she is a pretty creature,” responded Pencroff. “I love her as a\r\nmother. She received us poor and needy, and what has she denied to\r\nthese five children who tumbled upon her out of the sky?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, captain, nothing,” answered Neb. And the two honest fellows\r\ngave three hearty cheers in honor of their island.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Spilett, seated by the mast, sketched the panorama before\r\nhim, while Smith looked on in silence.\r\n\r\n“What do you say of our boat, now, sir?” demanded Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“It acts very well,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Good. And now don’t you think it could undertake a voyage of some\r\nlength?”\r\n\r\n“Where, Pencroff?”\r\n\r\n“To Tabor Island, for instance.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” replied the engineer, “I believe that in a case of\r\nnecessity there need be no hesitancy in trusting to the Good Luck even\r\nfor a longer journey; but, you know, I would be sorry to see you leave\r\nfor Tabor Island, because nothing obliges you to go.”\r\n\r\n“One likes to know one’s neighbors,” answered Pencroff, whose mind was\r\nmade up. “Tabor Island is our neighbor, and is all alone. Politeness\r\nrequires that at least we make her a visit.”\r\n\r\n“The mischief!” exclaimed Spilett, “our friend Pencroff is a stickler\r\nfor propriety.”\r\n\r\n“I am not a stickler at all,” retorted the sailor, who was a little\r\nvexed by the engineer’s opposition.\r\n\r\n“Remember, Pencroff,” said Smith, “that you could not go the island\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“One other would be all I would want.”\r\n\r\n“Supposing so,” replied the engineer, “would you risk depriving our\r\ncolony of five, of two of its colonists?”\r\n\r\n“There are six,” rejoined Pencroff. “You forget Jup.”\r\n\r\n“There are seven,” added Neb. “Top is as good as another.”\r\n\r\n“There is no risk in it, Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff again.\r\n\r\n“Possibly not, Pencroff; but, I repeat, that it is exposing oneself\r\nwithout necessity.”\r\n\r\nThe obstinate sailor did not answer, but let the conversation drop for\r\nthe present. He little thought that an incident was about to aid him,\r\nand change to a work of humanity what had been merely a caprice open to\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe Good Luck, after having stood out to sea, was returning towards the\r\ncoast and making for Balloon Harbor, as it was important to locate the\r\nchannel-way between the shoals and reefs so as to buoy them, for this\r\nlittle inlet was to be resting place of the sloop.\r\n\r\nThey were half a mile off shore, beating up to windward and moving\r\nsomewhat slowly, as the boat was under the lee of the land. The sea was\r\nas smooth as glass. Herbert was standing in the bows indicating the\r\nchannel-way. Suddenly he cried:—\r\n\r\n“Luff, Pencroff, luff.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” cried the sailor, springing to his feet. “A rock?”\r\n\r\n“No—hold on, I cannot see very well—luff again—steady—bear away a\r\nlittle—” and while thus speaking, the lad lay down along the deck,\r\nplunged his arm quickly into the water, and then rising up again with\r\nsomething in his hand, exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“It is a bottle!”\r\n\r\nSmith took it, and without saying a word, withdrew the cork and took\r\nout a wet paper, on which was written these words:—\r\n\r\n“A shipwrecked man—Tabor Island:—l53° W. lon.—37° 11’ S. lat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTURE DECIDED UPON—PREPARATIONS—THE THREE PASSENGERS—THE FIRST\r\nNIGHT—THE SECOND NIGHT—TABOR ISLAND—SEARCH ON THE SHORE—SEARCH IN THE\r\nWOODS—NO ONE—ANIMALS—PLANTS—A HOUSE—DESERTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Some one shipwrecked!” cried Pencroff, “abandoned some hundred miles\r\nfrom us upon Tabor Island! Oh! Mr. Smith, you will no longer oppose my\r\nproject!”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff, and you must leave as soon as possible.”.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer held the paper which he had taken from the bottle in his\r\nhand. He considered for a few moments, and then spoke:—\r\n\r\n“From this paper, my friends,” said he, “and from the manner in which\r\nit is worded, we must conclude that, in the first place, the person\r\ncast away upon Tabor Island is a man well informed, since he gives the\r\nlatitude and longitude of his island exactly; secondly, that he is\r\nEnglish or American, since the paper is written in English.”\r\n\r\n“That is a logical conclusion,” answered Spilett, “and the presence of\r\nthis person explains the arrival of the box on our coast. There has\r\nbeen a shipwreck, since some one has been shipwrecked. And he is\r\nfortunate in that Pencroff had the idea of building this boat and even\r\nof trying it to-day, for in twenty-four hours the bottle would have\r\nbeen broken on the rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,!’ said Herbert, “it is a happy chance that the Good Luck\r\npassed by the very spot where this bottle was floating.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t it seem to you odd?” asked Smith of Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“It seems fortunate, that’s all,” replied the sailor. “Do you see\r\nanything extraordinary in it, sir? This bottle must have gone\r\nsomewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right, Pencroff,” responded the engineer, “and\r\nnevertheless—”\r\n\r\n“But,” interrupted Herbert, “nothing proves that this bottle has\r\nfloated in the water for a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” responded Spilett, “and moreover the paper seems to have\r\nbeen recently written. What do you think, Cyrus?”\r\n\r\n“It is hard to decide.” answered Smith..\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pencroff had not been idle. He had gone about, and the Good\r\nLuck, with a free wind, all her sails drawing, was speeding toward Claw\r\nCape. Each one thought of the castaway on Tabor Island. Was there still\r\ntime to save him? This was a great event in the lives of the colonists.\r\nThey too were but castaways, but it was not probable that another had\r\nbeen as favored as they had been, and it was their duty to hasten at\r\nonce to this one’s relief. By 2 o’clock Claw Cape was doubled, and the\r\nGood Luck anchored at the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nThat evening all the details of the expedition were arranged. It was\r\nagreed that Herbert and Pencroff, who understood the management of a\r\nboat, were to undertake the voyage alone. By leaving the next day, the\r\n11th of October, they would reach the island, supposing the wind\r\ncontinued, in forty-eight hours. Allowing for one day there, and three\r\nor four days to return in, they could calculate on being at Lincoln\r\nIsland again on the 17th. The weather was good, the barometer rose\r\nsteadily, the wind seemed as if it would continue, everything favored\r\nthese brave men, who were going so far to do a humane act.\r\n\r\nThus, Smith, Neb, and Spilett was to remain at Granite House; but at\r\nthe last moment, the latter, remembering his duty as reporter to the\r\nNew York _Herald_, having declared that he would swim rather than lose\r\nsuch an opportunity, was allowed to take part in the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe evening was employed in putting bedding, arms, munitions,\r\nprovisions, etc., on board, and the next morning, by 5 o’clock, the\r\ngood-byes were spoken, and Pencroff, hoisting the sails, headed for\r\nClaw Cape, which had to be doubled before taking the route to the\r\nsoutheast. The Good Luck was already a quarter of a mile from shore\r\nwhen her passengers saw upon the heights of Granite House two men\r\nsignalling farewells. They were Smith and Neb, from whom they were\r\nseparating for the first time in fifteen months.\r\n\r\nPencroff, Herbert, and the reporter returned the signal, and soon\r\nGranite House disappeared behind the rocks of the Cape.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning, the Good Luck remained in view of the southern\r\ncoast of the island, which appeared like a green clump of trees, above\r\nwhich rose Mount Franklin. The heights, lessened by distance, gave it\r\nan appearance little calculated to attract ships on its coasts. At 1\r\no’clock Reptile Promontory was passed ten miles distant. It was\r\ntherefore impossible to distinguish the western coast, which extended\r\nto the spurs of the mountain, and three hours later, Lincoln Island had\r\ndisappeared behind the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe Good Luck behaved admirably. She rode lightly over the seas and\r\nsailed rapidly. Pencroff had set his topsail, and with a fair wind he\r\nfollowed a straight course by the compass. Occasionally Herbert took\r\nthe tiller, and the hand of the young lad was so sure, that the sailor\r\nhad nothing to correct.\r\n\r\nSpilett chatted with one and the other, and lent a hand when necessary\r\nin manœuvring the sloop. Captain Pencroff was perfectly satisfied with\r\nhis crew, and was constantly promising them an extra allowance of grog.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the slender crescent of the moon glimmered in the\r\ntwilight. The night came on dark but starlit, with the promise of a\r\nfine day on the morrow. Pencroff thought it prudent to take in the\r\ntopsail, which was perhaps an excess of caution in so still a night,\r\nbut he was a careful sailor, and was not to be blamed.\r\n\r\nThe reporter slept during half the night, Herbert and Pencroff taking\r\ntwo-hour turns at the helm. The sailor had as much confidence in his\r\npupil as he had in himself, and his trust was justified by the coolness\r\nand judgment of the lad. Pencroff set the course as a captain to his\r\nhelmsman, and Herbert did not allow the Good Luck to deviate a point\r\nfrom her direction.\r\n\r\nThe night and the next day passed quietly and safely. The Good Luck\r\nheld her southeast course, and, unless she was drawn aside by some\r\nunknown current, she would make Tabor Island exactly. The sea was\r\ncompletely deserted, save that sometimes an albatross or frigate-bird\r\npassed within gun-shot distance.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said Herbert, “this is the season when the whalers usually\r\ncome towards the southern part of the Pacific. I don’t believe that\r\nthere is a sea more deserted than this.”\r\n\r\n“It is not altogether deserted,” responded Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Why we are here. Do you take us for porpoises or our sloop for\r\ndriftwood?” And Pencroff laughed at his pleasantry.\r\n\r\nBy evening they calculated the distance traversed at 130 miles, or\r\nthree and a third miles an hour. The breeze was dying away, but they\r\nhad reason to hope, supposing their course to have been correct, that\r\nthey would sight Tabor Island at daylight.\r\n\r\nNo one of the three slept during this night. While waiting for morning\r\nthey experienced the liveliest emotions. There was so much uncertainty\r\nin their enterprise. Were they near the island? Was the shipwrecked man\r\nstill there? Who was he? Might not his presence disturb the unity of\r\nthe colony? Would he, indeed, consent to exchange one prison for\r\nanother? All these questions, which would doubtless be answered the\r\nnext day, kept them alert, and at the earliest dawn they began to scan\r\nthe western horizon.\r\n\r\nWhat was the joy of the little crew when towards 6 o’clock Pencroff\r\nshouted—\r\n\r\n“Land!”\r\n\r\nIn a few hours they would be upon its shore.\r\n\r\nThe island was a low coast, raised but a little above the waves, not\r\nmore than fifteen miles away. The sloop, which had been heading south\r\nof it, was put about, and, as the sun rose, a few elevations became\r\nvisible here and there.\r\n\r\n“It is not as large as Lincoln Island,” said Herbert, “and probably\r\nowes its origin to like submarine convulsions.”\r\n\r\nBy 11 o’clock the Good Luck was only two miles distant from shore, and\r\nPencroff, while seeking some place to land, sailed with extreme caution\r\nthrough these unknown waters. They could see the whole extent of this\r\nisland, on which were visible groups of gum and other large trees of\r\nthe same species as those on Lincoln Island. But, it was astonishing,\r\nthat no rising smoke indicated that the place was inhabited, nor was\r\nany signal visible upon the shore. Nevertheless the paper had been\r\nprecise: it stated that there was a shipwrecked man here; and he should\r\nhave been upon the watch.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Good Luck went in through the tortuous passages between\r\nthe reefs, Herbert steering, and the sailor stationed forward, keeping\r\na sharp lookout, with the halliards in his hand, ready to run down the\r\nsail. Spilett, with the spy-glass, examined all the shore without\r\nperceiving anything. By noon the sloop touched the beach, the anchor\r\nwas let go, the sails furled, and the crew stepped on shore.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt that that was Tabor Island, since the most\r\nrecent maps gave no other land in all this part of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAfter having securely moored the sloop, Pencroff and his companion,\r\nwell armed, ascended the coast towards a round hill, some 250 feet\r\nhigh, which was distant about half a mile, from the summit of which\r\nthey expected to have a good view of the island.\r\n\r\nThe explorers followed the edge of grassy plain which ended at the foot\r\nof the hill. Rock-pigeons and sea-swallows circled about them, and in\r\nthe woods bordering the plain to the left they heard rustlings in the\r\nbushes and saw movements in the grass indicating the presence of very\r\ntimid animals, but nothing, so far, indicated that the island was\r\ninhabited.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the hill the party soon climbed to its summit, and their\r\ngaze traversed the whole horizon. They were certainly upon an island,\r\nnot more than six miles in circumference, in shape a long oval, and but\r\nlittle broken by inlets or promontories. All around it, the sea,\r\nabsolutely deserted, stretched away to the horizon.\r\n\r\nThis islet differed greatly from Lincoln Island in that it was covered\r\nover its entire surface with woods, and the uniform mass of verdure\r\nclothed two or three less elevated hills. Obliquely to the oval of the\r\nisland a small stream crossed a large grassy plain and emptied into the\r\nsea on the western side by a narrowed mouth.\r\n\r\n“The place is small,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the sailor. “It would have been too small for us.”\r\n\r\n“And,” added the reporter, “it seems uninhabited.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said Pencroff, “let us go down and search.”\r\n\r\nThe party returned to the sloop, and they decided to walk round the\r\nentire island before venturing into its interior, so that no place\r\ncould escape their investigation.\r\n\r\nThe shore was easily followed, and the explorers proceeded towards the\r\nsouth, starting up flocks of aquatic birds and numbers of seals, which\r\nlatter threw themselves into the sea as soon as they caught sight of\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\n“Those beasts are not looking on man for the first time. They fear what\r\nthey know,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\nAn hour after their departure the three had reached the southern point\r\nof the islet, which terminated in a sharp cape, and they turned towards\r\nthe north, following the western shore, which was sandy, like the\r\nother, and bounded by a thick wood.\r\n\r\nIn four hours after they had set out the party had made the circuit of\r\nthe island, without having seen any trace of a habitation, and not even\r\na footprint. It was most extraordinary, to say the least, and it seemed\r\nnecessary to believe that the place was not and had not been inhabited.\r\nPerhaps, after all, the paper had been in the water for many months, or\r\neven years, and it was possible, in that case, that the shipwrecked one\r\nhad been rescued or that he had died from suffering.\r\n\r\nThe little party, discussing all sorts of possibilities, made a hasty\r\ndinner on board the sloop, and at 5 o’clock started to explore the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nNumerous animals fled before their approach, principally, indeed\r\nsolely, goats and pigs, which it was easy to see were of European\r\norigin. Doubtless some whaler had left them here, and they had rapidly\r\nmultiplied. Herbert made up his mind to catch two or three pairs to\r\ntake back to Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any doubt that the island had previously been\r\nvisited. This was the more evident as in passing through the forest\r\nthey saw the traces of pathways, and the trunks of trees felled by the\r\nhatchet, and all about, marks of human handiwork; but these trees had\r\nbeen felled years before; the hatchet marks were velvetted with moss,\r\nand the pathways were so overgrown with grass that it was difficult to\r\ndiscover them.\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Spilett, “this proves that men not only landed here,\r\nbut that they lived here. Now who and how many were these men, and how\r\nmany remain?”\r\n\r\n“The paper speaks of but one,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroff, “if he is still here we cannot help finding\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThe exploration was continued, following diagonally across the island,\r\nand by this means the sailor and his companions reached the little\r\nstream which flowed towards the sea.\r\n\r\nIf animals of European origin, if works of human hands proved\r\nconclusively that man had once been here, many specimens of the\r\nvegetable kingdom also evidenced the fact. In certain clear places it\r\nwas plain that kitchen vegetables had formerly been planted. And\r\nHerbert was overjoyed when he discovered potatoes, succory, sorrel,\r\ncarrots, cabbage, and turnips, the seeds of which would enrich the\r\ngarden at Granite House.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” exclaimed Pencroff, “this will rejoice Neb. Even if we don’t\r\nfind the man, our voyage will not have been useless, and Heaven will\r\nhave rewarded us.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” replied Spilett, “but from the conditions of these fields,\r\nit looks as if the place had not been inhabited for a long time.”\r\n\r\n“An inhabitant, whoever he was, would not neglect anything so important\r\nas this.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, this man has gone. It must be—”\r\n\r\n“That the paper had been written a long time ago?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“And that the bottle had been floating in the sea a good while before\r\nit arrived at Lincoln Island?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said Pencroff. “But, see, it is getting dark,” he added,\r\n“and I think we had better give over the search.”\r\n\r\n“We will go aboard, and to-morrow we will begin again,” replied the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\nThey were about adopting this counsel, when Herbert, pointing to\r\nsomething dimly visible, through the trees, exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“There’s a house!”\r\n\r\nAll three directed their steps towards the place indicated, and they\r\nmade out in the twilight that it was built of planks, covered with\r\nheavy tarpaulin. The door, half closed, was pushed back by Pencroff,\r\nwho entered quickly.\r\n\r\nThe place was empty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTORY—THE NIGHT—SOME LETTERS—THE SEARCH CONTINUED—PLANTS AND\r\nANIMALS—HERBERT IN DANGER—ABOARD—THE DEPARTURE—BAD WEATHER—A GLIMMER OF\r\nINTELLIGENCE —LOST AT SEA—A TIMELY LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPencroff, Spilett and Herbert stood silent In darkness. Then the former\r\ngave a loud call. There was no answer. He lit a twig, and the light\r\nilluminated for a moment a small room, seemingly deserted. At one end\r\nwas a large chimney, containing some cold cinders and an armful of dry\r\nwood. Pencroff threw the lighted twig into it, and the wood caught fire\r\nand gave out a bright light.\r\n\r\nThe sailor and his companions thereupon discovered a bed in disorder,\r\nits damp and mildewed covers proving that it had been long unused; in\r\nthe corner of the fireplace were two rusty kettles and an overturned\r\npot; a clothes-press with some sailors’ clothing, partially moulded; on\r\nthe table a tin plate, and a Bible, injured by the dampness; in a\r\ncorner some tools, a shovel, a mattock, a pick, two shot guns, one of\r\nwhich was broken; on a shelf was a barrel full of powder, a barrel of\r\nlead, and a number of boxes of caps. All were covered with a thick\r\ncoating of dust.\r\n\r\n“There is no one here,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Not a soul.”\r\n\r\n“This room has not been occupied in a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Since a very long time.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Spilett,” said Pencroff, “I think that instead of going on board\r\nwe had better stay here all night.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Pencroff, and if the proprietor returns he will not be\r\nsorry, perhaps, to find the place occupied.”\r\n\r\n“He won’t come back, though,” said the sailor, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Do you think he has left the island?”\r\n\r\n“If he had left the island he would have taken these things with him.\r\nYou know how much a shipwrecked person would be attached to these\r\nobjects. No, no,” repeated the sailor, in the tone of a man perfectly\r\nconvinced; “no, he has not left the island. He is surely here.”\r\n\r\n“Alive?”\r\n\r\n“Alive or dead. But if he is dead he could not have buried himself, I\r\nam sure, and we will at least find his remains.”\r\n\r\nIt was therefore agreed to pass the night in this house, and a supply\r\nof wood in the corner gave them the means of heating it. The door\r\nhaving been closed, the three explorers, seated upon a bench, spoke\r\nlittle, but remained deep in thought. They were in the mood to accept\r\nanything that might happen, and they listened eagerly for any sound\r\nfrom without. If the door had suddenly opened and a man had stood\r\nbefore them, they would not have been much surprised, in spite of all\r\nthe evidence of desolation throughout the house; and their hands were\r\nready to clasp the hands of this man, of this shipwrecked one, of this\r\nunknown friend whose friends awaited him.\r\n\r\nBut no sound was heard, the door did not open, and the hours passed by.\r\n\r\nThe night seemed interminable to the sailor and his companions.\r\nHerbert, alone, slept for two hours, as at his age, sleep is a\r\nnecessity. All were anxious to renew the search of the day before, and\r\nto explore the innermost recesses of the islet. Pencroff’s conclusions\r\nwere certainly just, since the house and its contents had been\r\nabandoned. They determined, therefore, to search for the remains of its\r\ninhabitant, and to give them Christian burial.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was daylight they began to examine the house. It was\r\nprettily situated under a small hill, on which grew several fine gum\r\ntrees. Before it a large space had been cleared, giving a view over the\r\nsea. A small lawn, surrounded by a dilapidated fence, extended to the\r\nbank of the little stream. The house had evidently been built from\r\nplanks taken from a ship. It seemed likely that a ship had been thrown\r\nupon the island, that all or at least one of the crew had been saved,\r\nand that this house had been built from the wreck. This was the more\r\nprobable, as Spilett, in going round the dwelling, saw on one of the\r\nplanks these half-effaced letters:—\r\n\r\nBR ... TAN ... A.\r\n\r\n“Britannia,” exclaimed Pencroff, who had been called by the reporter to\r\nlook at it; “that is a common name among ships, and I cannot say\r\nwhether it is English or American. However, it don’t matter to what\r\ncountry the man belongs, we will save him, if he is alive. But before\r\nwe begin our search let us go back to the Good Luck.”\r\n\r\nPencroff had been seized with a sort of anxiety about his sloop.\r\nSupposing the island was inhabited, and some one had taken it—but he\r\nshrugged his shoulders at this unlikely thought. Nevertheless the\r\nsailor was not unwilling to go on board to breakfast. The route already\r\nmarked was not more than a mile in length, and they started on their\r\nwalk, looking carefully about them in the woods and underbrush, through\r\nwhich ran hundreds of pigs and goats.\r\n\r\nIn twenty minutes the party reached the place where the Good Luck rode\r\nquietly at anchor. Pencroff gave a sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this boat was his baby, and it is a father’s right to be\r\noften anxious without reason.\r\n\r\nAll went on board and ate a hearty breakfast, so as not to want\r\nanything before a late dinner; then the exploration was renewed, and\r\nconducted with the utmost carefulness. As it was likely that the\r\nsolitary inhabitant of this island was dead, the party sought rather to\r\nfind his remains than any traces of him living. But during all the\r\nmorning they were unable to find anything; if he was dead, some animal\r\nmust have devoured his body.\r\n\r\n“We will leave to-morrow at daylight,” said Pencroff to his companions,\r\nwho towards 2 o’clock were resting for a few moments under a group of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n“I think we need not hesitate to take those things which belonged to\r\nhim?” queried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” answered Spilett; “and these arms and tools will add\r\nmaterially to the stock at Granite House. If I am not mistaken, what is\r\nleft of the lead and powder is worth a good deal.”\r\n\r\n“And we must not forget to capture a couple of these pigs,” said\r\nPencroff.\r\n\r\n“Nor to gather some seed,” added Herbert, “which will give us some of\r\nour own vegetables.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it would be better to spend another day here, in order to get\r\ntogether everything that we want,” suggested the reporter.\r\n\r\n“No, sir;” replied the sailor. “I want to get away to-morrow morning.\r\nThe wind seems to be shifting to the west, and will be in our favor\r\ngoing back.”\r\n\r\n“Then don’t let us lose any time,” said Herbert, rising.\r\n\r\n“We will not,” replied Pencroff. “Herbert, you get the seed, and\r\nSpilett and I will chase the pigs, and although we haven’t Top, I think\r\nwe will catch some.”\r\n\r\nHerbert, therefore, followed the path which led to the cultivated part\r\nof the island, while the others plunged at once into the forest.\r\nAlthough the pigs were plenty they were singularly agile, and not in\r\nthe humor to be captured. However, after half an hour’s chasing the\r\nhunters had captured a couple in their lair, when cries mingled with\r\nhorrible hoarse sounds, having nothing human in them, were heard.\r\nPencroff and Spilett sprang to their feet, regardless of the pigs,\r\nwhich escaped.\r\n\r\n“It is Herbert!” cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Hurry!” cried the sailor, as the two ran with their utmost speed\r\ntowards the place from whence the cries came.\r\n\r\nThey had need to hasten, for at a turn in the path they saw the lad\r\nprostrate beneath a savage, or perhaps a gigantic ape, who was\r\nthrottling him.\r\n\r\nTo throw themselves on this monster and pinion him to the ground,\r\ndragging Herbert away, was the work of a moment. The sailor had\r\nherculean strength. Spilett, too, was muscular, and, in spite of the\r\nresistance of the monster, it was bound so that it could not move.\r\n\r\n“You are not wounded, Herbert?”\r\n\r\n“No, oh no.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! if it had hurt you, this ape-”\r\n\r\n“But he is not an ape!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\nAt these words Pencroff and Spilett looked again at the object lying on\r\nthe ground. In fact, it was not an ape, but a human being—a man! But\r\nwhat a man! He was a savage, in all the horrible acceptation of the\r\nword; and, what was more frightful, he seemed to have fallen to the\r\nlast degree of brutishness.\r\n\r\nMatted hair, tangled beard descending to his waist, his body naked,\r\nsave for a rag about his loins, wild eyes, long nails, mahogany-colored\r\nskin, feet as hard as if they had been made of horn; such was the\r\nmiserable creature which it was, nevertheless, necessary to call a man.\r\nBut one might well question whether this body still contained a soul,\r\nor whether the low, brutish instinct alone survived.\r\n\r\n“Are you perfectly sure that this is what has been a man?” questioned\r\nPencroff of the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Alas! there can be no doubt of it,” replied Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Can he be the person shipwrecked?” asked Herbert\r\n\r\n“Yes,” responded the reporter, “but the poor creature is no longer\r\nhuman.”\r\n\r\nSpilett was right. Evidently, if the castaway had ever been civilized,\r\nisolation had made him a savage, a real creature of the woods. He gave\r\nutterance to hoarse sounds, from between teeth which were as sharp as\r\nthose of animals living on raw flesh. Memory had doubtless long ago\r\nleft him, and he had long since forgotten the use of arms and tools,\r\nand even how to make a fire. One could see that he was active and\r\nsupple, but that his physical qualities had developed to the exclusion\r\nof his moral perception.\r\n\r\nSpilett spoke to him, but he neither understood nor listened, and,\r\nlooking him in the eye, the reporter could see that all intelligence\r\nhad forsaken him. Nevertheless, the prisoner did not struggle or strive\r\nto break his bonds. Was he cowed by the presence of these men, whom he\r\nhad once resembled? Was there in some corner of his brain a flitting\r\nremembrance which drew him towards humanity? Free, would he have fled\r\nor would he have remained? They did not know, and they did not put him\r\nto the proof. After having looked attentively at the miserable\r\ncreature, Spilett said:—\r\n\r\n“What he is, what he has been, and what he will be; it is still our\r\nduty to take him to Lincoln Island.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, yes,” exclaimed Herbert, “and perhaps we can, with care,\r\nrestore to him some degree of intelligence.”\r\n\r\n“The soul never dies,” answered the reporter, “and it would be a great\r\nthing to bring back this creature of God’s making from his\r\nbrutishness.”\r\n\r\nPencroff shook his head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“It is necessary to try at all events,” said the reporter, “humanity\r\nrequires it of us.”\r\n\r\n“It was, indeed, their duty as civilized and Christian beings, and they\r\nwell knew that Smith would approve of their course.\r\n\r\n“Shall we leave him bound?” inquired the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps if we unfasten his feet he will walk,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well, let us try,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\nAnd the cords binding the creature’s legs were loosened, although his\r\narms were kept firmly bound. He rose without manifesting any desire to\r\nescape. His tearless eyes darted sharp glances upon the three men who\r\nmarched beside him, and nothing denoted that he remembered being or\r\nhaving been like them. A wheezing sound escaped from his lips, and his\r\naspect was wild, but he made no resistance.\r\n\r\nBy the advice of the reporter, the poor wretch was taken to the house,\r\nwhere, perhaps, the sight of the objects in it might make some\r\nimpression upon him. Perhaps a single gleam would awaken his sleeping\r\nconsciousness, illuminate his darkened mind.\r\n\r\nThe house was near by, and in a few minutes they were there; but the\r\nprisoner recognized nothing—he seemed to have lost consciousness of\r\neverything. Could it be that this brutish state was due to his long\r\nimprisonment on the island? That, having come here a reasoning being,\r\nhis isolation had reduced him to this state?\r\n\r\nThe reporter thought that perhaps the sight of fire might affect him,\r\nand in a moment one of those lovely flames which attract even animals\r\nlit up the fireplace. The sight of this flame seemed at first to\r\nattract the attention of the unfortunate man, but very soon he ceased\r\nregarding it. Evidently, for the present at least, there was nothing to\r\ndo but take him aboard the Good Luck, which was accordingly done. He\r\nwas left in charge of Pencroff, while the two others returned to the\r\nisland and brought over the arms and implements, a lot of seeds, some\r\ngame, and two pairs of pigs which they had caught. Everything was put\r\non board, and the sloop rode ready to hoist anchor as soon as the next\r\nmorning’s tide would permit.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner had been placed in the forward hold, where he lay calm,\r\nquiet, insensible, and mute. Pencroff offering him some cooked meat to\r\neat, he pushed it away; but, on being shown one of the ducks which\r\nHerbert had killed, he pounced on it with bestial avidity and devoured\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“You think he’ll be himself again?” asked the sailor, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” replied the reporter. “It is not impossible that our\r\nattentions will react on him, since it is the isolation that has done\r\nthis; and he will be alone no longer.”\r\n\r\n“The poor fellow has doubtless been this way for a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so.”\r\n\r\n“How old do you think he is?” asked the lad.\r\n\r\n“That is hard to say,” replied the reporter, “as his matted beard\r\nobscures his face; but he is no longer young, and I should say he was\r\nat least fifty years old.”\r\n\r\n“Have you noticed how his eyes are set deep in his head?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I think that they are more human than one would suspect from\r\nhis general appearance.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we will see,” said Pencroff; “and I am curious to have Mr.\r\nSmith’s opinion of our savage. We went to find a human being, and we\r\nare bringing back a monster. Any how, one takes what he can get.”\r\n\r\nThe night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not he did not\r\nmove, although he had been unbound. He was like one of those beasts\r\nthat in the first moments of their capture submit, and to whom the rage\r\nreturns later.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the next day, the 17th, the change in the weather was as\r\nPencroff had predicted. The wind hauled round to the northwest and\r\nfavored the return of the Good Luck; but at the same time it had\r\nfreshened, so as to make the sailing more difficult. At 5 o’clock the\r\nanchor was raised, Pencroff took a reef in the mainsail and headed\r\ndirectly towards home.\r\n\r\nThe first day passed without incident. The prisoner rested quietly in\r\nthe forward cabin, and, as he had once been a sailor, the motion of the\r\nsloop produced upon him a sort of salutary reaction. Did it recall to\r\nhim some remembrance of his former occupation? At least he rested\r\ntranquil, more astonished than frightened.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the wind freshened considerably, coming round more to the\r\nnorth, and therefore in a direction less favorable to the course of the\r\nGood Luck, which bounded over the waves. Pencroff was soon obliged to\r\nhold her nearer to the wind, and without saying so, he began to be\r\nanxious at the lookout ahead. Certainly, unless the—wind moderated, it\r\nwould take much longer to go back than it had taken to come.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th they had been forty-eight hours out, and yet nothing\r\nindicated they were in the neighborhood of Lincoln Island. It was,\r\nmoreover, impossible to reckon their course, or even to estimate the\r\ndistance traversed, as the direction and the speed had been too\r\nirregular. Twenty-four hours later there was still no land in view. The\r\nwind was dead ahead, and an ugly sea running. On the 18th a huge wave\r\nstruck the sloop, and had not the crew been lashed to the deck, they\r\nwould have been swept overboard.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Pencroff and his companions, busy in clearing things\r\naway, received an unhoped-for assistance from the prisoner, who sprang\r\nfrom the hatchway as if his sailor instinct had returned to him, and\r\nbreaking the rail by a, vigorous blow—with a spar, enabled the water on\r\nthe deck to flow off more freely. Then, the boat cleared, without\r\nhaving said a word, he returned to his cabin.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the situation was bad, and the sailor had cause to\r\nbelieve himself lost upon this vast sea, without the possibility of\r\nregaining his course. The night of the 18th was dark and cold. But\r\nabout 11 o’clock the wind lulled, the sea fell, and the sloop, less\r\ntossed about, moved more rapidly. None of the crew thought of sleep.\r\nThey kept an eager lookout, as either Lincoln Island must be near at\r\nhand and they would discover it at daybreak, or the sloop had been\r\ndrifted from her course by the currents, and it would be next to\r\nimpossible to rectify the direction.\r\n\r\nPencroff, anxious to the last degree, did not, however, despair; but,\r\nseated at the helm, he tried to see through the thick darkness around\r\nhim. Towards 2 o’clock he suddenly started up, crying:—“A light! a\r\nlight!” It was indeed a bright light appearing twenty miles to—the\r\nnortheast. Lincoln Island was there, and this light, evidently lit by\r\nSmith, indicated the direction to be followed.\r\n\r\nPencroff, who had been heading much too far towards the north, changed\r\nhis course, and steered directly towards the light, which gleamed above\r\nthe horizon like a star of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN-DISCUSSION—SMITH AND THE UNKNOWN—BALLOON HARBOR-THE DEVOTION\r\nOF THE ENGINEER-A TOUCHING EXPERIENCE-TEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 7 o’clock the next morning the boat touched the shore at the mouth\r\nof the Mercy. Smith and Neb, who had become very anxious at the stormy\r\nweather and the prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed, at\r\ndaylight, to Prospect Plateau, and had at length perceived the sloop in\r\nthe distance.\r\n\r\n“Thank Heaven! There they are,” exclaimed Smith; while Neb, dancing\r\nwith pleasure, turned towards his master, and, striking his hands\r\ntogether, cried, “Oh, my master!”-a more touching expression than, the\r\nfirst polished phrase.\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s first thought, on counting the number of persons on the\r\ndeck of the Good Luck, was that Pencroff had found no one on Tabor\r\nIsland, or that the unfortunate man had refused to exchange one prison\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and Neb were on the beach at the moment the sloop arrived,\r\nand before the party had leaped ashore, Smith said:—\r\n\r\n“We have been very anxious about you, my friends. Did anything happen\r\nto you?” “No, indeed; everything went finely,” replied Spilett. “We\r\nwill tell you all about it.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, you have failed in your search, since you are all\r\nalone.”, “But, sir, there are four of us,” said the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Have you found this person?”. “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And brought him back?” “Yes.” “Living?” “Where is he, and what is he,\r\nthen?” “He is, or rather, he was a human being; and that is all, Cyrus,\r\nthat we can say.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer was thereupon, informed of everything that had happened;\r\nof the search, of the long-abandoned house, of the capture of the\r\nscarcely human inhabitant.\r\n\r\n“And,” added Pencroff,” I don’t know whether we have done right in\r\nbringing him here.”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly you have done right,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“But the poor fellow has no sense at all.” “Not now, perhaps; in a few\r\nmonths, he will be as much a man as any of us. “Who knows what might\r\nhappen to the last one of us, after living for a long time alone on\r\nthis island? It is terrible to be all alone, my friends, and it is\r\nprobable that solitude quickly overthrows reason, since you have found\r\nthis poor being in such a condition.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Smith,” asked Herbert, “what makes you think that the\r\nbrutishness of this man has come on within a little while?”\r\n\r\n“Because the paper we found had been recently written, and no one but\r\nthis shipwrecked man could have written it.”\r\n\r\n“Unless,” suggested Spilett, “it had been written by a companion of\r\nthis man who has since died.”\r\n\r\n“That is impossible, Spilett.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because, then, the paper would have mentioned two persons instead of\r\none.”\r\n\r\nHerbert briefly related the incident of the sea striking the sloop, and\r\ninsisted that the prisoner must then have had a glimmer of his sailor\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\n“You are perfectly right, Herbert,” said the engineer, “to attach great\r\nimportance to this fact. This poor man will not be incurable; despair\r\nhas made him what he is. But here he will find his kindred, and if he\r\nstill has any reason, we will save it.”\r\n\r\nThen, to Smith’s great pity and Neb’s wonderment, the man was brought\r\nup from the cabin of the sloop, and as soon as he was on land, he\r\nmanifested a desire to escape. But Smith, approaching him, laid his\r\nhand authoritatively upon his shoulder and looked at him with infinite\r\ntenderness. Thereupon the poor wretch, submitting to a sort of\r\ninstantaneous power, became quiet, his eyes fell, his head dropped\r\nforward, and he made no further resistance.\r\n\r\n“Poor shipwrecked sailor,” murmured the reporter.\r\n\r\nSmith regarded him attentively. To judge from his appearance, this\r\nmiserable creature had little of the human left in him; but Smith\r\ncaught in his glance, as the reporter had done, an almost imperceptible\r\ngleam of intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the Unknown, as his new companions called him,\r\nshould stay in one of the rooms of Granite House, from which he could\r\nnot escape. He made no resistance to being conducted there, and with\r\ngood care they might, perhaps, hope that some day he would prove a\r\ncompanion to them.\r\n\r\nNeb hastened to prepare breakfast, for the voyagers were very hungry,\r\nand during the meal Smith made them relate in detail every incident of\r\nthe cruise. He agreed with them in thinking that the name of the\r\nBritannia gave them reason to believe that the Unknown was either\r\nEnglish or American; and, moreover, under all the growth of hair\r\ncovering the man’s face, the engineer thought he recognized the\r\nfeatures characteristic of an Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\n“But, by the way, Herbert,” said the reporter, “you have never told us\r\nhow you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that he would have\r\nstrangled you, had we not arrived so opportunely.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I am not sure that I can tell just what happened,” replied\r\nHerbert. “I was, I think, gathering seeds, when I heard a tremendous\r\nnoise in a high tree near by. I had hardly time to turn, when this\r\nunhappy creature, who had, doubtless, been hidden crouching in the\r\ntree, threw himself upon me; and, unless Mr. Spilett and Pencroff—”\r\n\r\n“You were in great danger, indeed, my boy,” said Smith; “but perhaps,\r\nif this had not happened, this poor being would have escaped your\r\nsearch, and we would have been without another companion.”\r\n\r\n“You expect, then, to make him a man again?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Smith.\r\n\r\nBreakfast ended, all returned to the shore and began unloading the\r\nsloop; and the engineer examined the arms and tools, but found nothing\r\nto establish the identity of the Unknown.\r\n\r\nThe pigs were taken to the stables, to which they would soon become\r\naccustomed. The two barrels of powder and shot and the caps were a\r\ngreat acquisition, and it was determined to make a small powder\r\nmagazine in the upper cavern of Granite House, where there would be no\r\ndanger of an explosion. Meantime, since the pyroxyline answered very\r\nwell, there was no present need to use this powder.\r\n\r\nWhen the sloop was unloaded Pencroff said:—\r\n\r\n“I think, Mr. Smith, that it would be better to put the Good Luck in a\r\nsafe place.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not safe enough at the mouth of the Mercy?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” replied the sailor. “Most of the time she is aground on the\r\nsand, which strains her.”\r\n\r\n“Could not she be moored out in the stream?”\r\n\r\n“She could, but the place is unsheltered, and in an easterly wind I am\r\nafraid she would suffer from the seas.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; where do you want to put her?”\r\n\r\n“In Balloon Harbor,” replied the sailor. “It seems to me that that\r\nlittle inlet, hidden by the rocks, is just the place for her.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it too far off?”\r\n\r\n“No, it is only three miles from Granite House, and we have a good\r\nstraight road there.”\r\n\r\n“Have your way, Pencroff,” replied the engineer. “Nevertheless, I\r\nshould prefer to have the sloop under our sight. We must, when we have\r\ntime, make a small harbor.”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” cried Pencroff. “A harbor with a light house, a breakwater,\r\nand a dry dock! Oh, indeed, sir, everything will be easy enough with\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\n“Always provided, my good man, that you assist me, as you do three\r\nfourths of the work.”\r\n\r\nHerbert and the sailor went aboard the Good Luck, and set sail, and in\r\na couple of hours the sloop rode quietly at anchor in the tranquil\r\nwater of Balloon Harbor.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few days that the Unknown was at Granite House, had he\r\ngiven any indication of a change in his savage nature? Did not a\r\nbrighter light illumine the depths of his intelligence? Was not, in\r\nshort, his reason returning to him? Undoubtedly, yes; and Smith and\r\nSpilett questioned whether this reason had ever entirely forsaken him.\r\n\r\nAt first this man, accustomed to the air and liberty which he had had\r\nin Tabor Island, was seized with fits of passion, and there was danger\r\nof his throwing himself out of one of the windows of Granite House. But\r\nlittle by little he grew more quiet, and he was allowed to move about\r\nwithout restraint.\r\n\r\nAlready forgetting his carnivorous instincts, he accepted a less\r\nbestial nourishment, and cooked food did not produce in him the\r\nsentiment of disgust which he had shown on board the Good Luck.\r\n\r\nSmith had taken advantage of a time when the man was asleep to cut the\r\nhair and beard which had grown like a mane about his face, and had\r\ngiven him such a savage aspect. He had also been clothed more decently,\r\nand the result was that the Unknown appeared more like a human being,\r\nand it seemed as if the expression of his eyes was softened. Certainly,\r\nsometimes, when intelligence was visible, the expression of this man\r\nhad a sort of beauty.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Smith made a point of passing some hours in his company. He\r\nworked beside him, and occupied himself in various ways to attract his\r\nattention. It would suffice, if a single ray of light illuminated his\r\nreason, if a single remembrance crossed his mind. Neither did the\r\nengineer neglect to speak in a loud voice, so as to penetrate by both\r\nsound and sight to the depths of this torpid intelligence. Sometimes\r\none or another of the party joined the engineer, and they usually\r\ntalked of such matters pertaining to the sea as would be likely to\r\ninterest the man. At times the Unknown gave a sort of vague attention\r\nto what was said, and soon the colonists began to think that he partly\r\nunderstood them. Again his expression would be dolorous, proving that\r\nhe suffered inwardly. Nevertheless, he did not speak, although they\r\nthought, at times, from his actions, that words were about to pass his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nThe poor creature was very calm and sad. But was not the calmness only\r\non the surface, and the sadness the result of his confinement? They\r\ncould not yet say. Seeing only certain objects and in a limited space,\r\nalways with the colonists, to whom he had become accustomed, having no\r\ndesire to satisfy, better clothed and better fed, it was natural that\r\nhis physical nature should soften little by little; but was he imbued\r\nwith the new life, or, to use an expression justly applicable to the\r\ncase, was he only tamed, as an animal in the presence of its master?\r\nThis was the important question Smith was anxious to determine, and\r\nmeantime he did not wish to be too abrupt with his patient. For to him,\r\nthe unknown was but a sick person. Would he ever be a convalescent?\r\n\r\nTherefore, the engineer watched him unceasingly. How he laid in wait\r\nfor his reason, so to speak, that he might lay hold of it.\r\n\r\nThe colonists followed with strong interest all the phases of this cure\r\nundertaken by Smith. All aided him in it, and all, save perhaps the\r\nincredulous Pencroff, came to share in his belief and hope.\r\n\r\nThe submission of the Unknown was entire, and it seemed as if he showed\r\nfor the engineer, whose influence over him was apparent, a sort of\r\nattachment, and Smith resolved now to test it by transporting him to\r\nanother scene, to that ocean which he had been accustomed to look upon,\r\nto the forest border, which would recall those woods where he had lived\r\nsuch a life!”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Spilett, “can we hope that once at liberty, he will not\r\nescape?”\r\n\r\n“We must make the experiment,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Pencroff. “You will see, when this fellow snuffs the\r\nfresh air and sees the coast clear, if he don’t make his legs spin!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“We will try, any how,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\nIt was the 30th of October, and the Unknown had been a prisoner for\r\nnine days. It was a beautiful, warm, sunshiny day. Smith and Pencroff\r\nwent to the room of the Unknown, whom they found at the window gazing\r\nout at the sky.\r\n\r\n“Come, my friend,” said the engineer to him.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown rose immediately. His eye was fixed on Smith, whom he\r\nfollowed; and the sailor, little confident in the results of the\r\nexperiment, walked with him.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the door, they made him get into the elevator, at the\r\nfoot of which the rest of the party were waiting. The basket descended,\r\nand in a few seconds all were standing together on the shore.\r\n\r\nThe colonists moved off a little distance from the Unknown, so as to\r\nleave him quite at liberty. He made some steps forward towards the sea,\r\nand his face lit up with pleasure, but he made no effort to escape. He\r\nlooked curiously at the little waves, which, broken by the islet, died\r\naway on the shore.\r\n\r\n“It is not, indeed, the ocean,” remarked Spilett, “and it is possible\r\nthat this does not give him the idea of escaping.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Smith, “we must take him to the plateau on the edge of\r\nthe forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive.”\r\n\r\n“There he cannot get away, since the bridges are all raised,” said Neb.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he is not the man to be troubled by such a brook as Glycerine\r\nCreek; he could leap it at a bound,” returned Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“We will see presently,” said Smith, who kept his eye fixed on his\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon all proceeded towards Prospect Plateau. Having reached\r\nthe place they encountered the outskirts of the forest, with its leaves\r\ntrembling in the wind, The Unknown seemed to drink in with eagerness\r\nthe perfume in the air, and a long sigh escaped from his breast.\r\n\r\nThe colonists stood some paces back, ready to seize him if he attempted\r\nto escape.\r\n\r\nThe poor creature was upon the point of plunging in the creek that\r\nseparated him from the forest; he placed himself ready to spring—then\r\nall at once he turned about, dropping his arms beside him, and tears\r\ncoursed down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Smith, “you will be a man again, since you weep!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED—THE FIRST WORDS OF THE UNKNOWN—TWELVE YEARS ON\r\nTHE ISLAND—CONFESSIONS—DISAPPEARANCE—SMITH’S CONFIDENCE —BUILDING A\r\nWIND-MILL—THE FIRST BREAD—AN ACT OF DEVOTION—HONEST HANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, the poor creature had wept. Some remembrance had flashed across\r\nhis spirit, and, as Smith had said, he would be made a man through his\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThe colonists left him for some time, withdrawing themselves, so that\r\nhe could feel perfectly at liberty; but he showed no inclination to\r\navail himself of this freedom, and Smith soon decided to take him back\r\nto Granite House.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this occurrence, the Unknown showed a disposition to\r\nenter little by little into the common life. It was evident that he\r\nheard, that he understood, but it was equally evident that he\r\nmanifested a strange disinclination to speak to them. Pencroff,\r\nlistening at his room, heard these words escape him:—\r\n\r\n“No! here! I! never!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor reported this to his companions, and Smith said:—\r\n\r\n“There must be some sad mystery here.”\r\n\r\nThe Unknown had begun to do some little chores, and to work in the\r\ngarden. When he rested, which was frequent, he seemed entirely\r\nself-absorbed; but, on the advice of the engineer, the others respected\r\nthe silence, which he seemed desirous of keeping. If one of the\r\ncolonists approached him he recoiled, sobbing as if overcome. Could it\r\nbe by remorse? or, was it, as Spilett once suggested:—\r\n\r\n“If he does not speak I believe it is because he has something on his\r\nmind too terrible to mention.”\r\n\r\nSome days later the Unknown was working on the plantation, when, of a\r\nsudden, he stopped and let his spade fall, and Smith, who was watching\r\nhim from a distance, saw that he was weeping again. An irresistible\r\npity drew the engineer to the poor fellow’s side; and, touching his arm\r\nlightly,\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown tried to look away, and when Smith sought to take his hand\r\nhe drew back quickly.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Smith, with decision, “I wish you to look at me.”\r\n\r\nThe Unknown obeyed, raising his eyes and regarding the other as one\r\ndoes who is under the influence of magnetism. At first he wished to\r\nbreak away, then his whole expression changed; his eyes flashed, and,\r\nunable longer to contain himself, he muttered some incoherent words.\r\nSuddenly he crossed his arms, and in a hollow voice:—\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Men shipwrecked as you have been,” replied the engineer, greatly\r\nmoved. “We have brought you here among your kindred.”\r\n\r\n“My kindred! I have none!\r\n\r\n“You are among friends—,”\r\n\r\n“Friends! I! Friends!” cried the Unknown, hiding his face in his hands.\r\n“Oh, no! never! Leave me! leave me!” and he rushed to the brink of the\r\nplateau overlooking the sea, and stood there, motionless, for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSmith had rejoined his companions and had related to them what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n“There certainly is a mystery in this man’s life,” said Spilett, “and\r\nit seems as if his first human sensation was remorse.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand what kind of a man we have brought back,” says the\r\nsailor. “He has secrets—”\r\n\r\n“Which we will respect,” answered the engineer, quickly. “If he has\r\ncommitted some fault he has cruelly expiated it, and in our sight it is\r\nabsolved.”\r\n\r\nFor two hours the Unknown remained upon the shore, evidently under the\r\ninfluence of remembrances which brought back to him all his past, a\r\npast which, doubtless, was hateful enough, and the colonists, though\r\nkeeping watch upon him, respected his desire to be alone.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he seemed to have taken a resolution, and he returned to the\r\nengineer. His eyes were red with the traces of tears, and his face wore\r\nan expression of deep humility. He seemed apprehensive, ashamed,\r\nhumiliated, and his looks were fixed on the ground.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, “are you and your companions English?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Smith, “we are Americans.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” murmured the Unknown, “I am glad of that.”\r\n\r\n“And what are you, my friend?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“English,” he responded, as if these few words had cost him a great\r\neffort. He rushed to the shore, and traversed its length to the mouth\r\nof the Mercy, in a state of extreme agitation.\r\n\r\nHaving, at one place, met Herbert, he stopped, and in a choking voice,\r\naccosted him:—\r\n\r\n“What month is it?”\r\n\r\n“November,” replied the lad.\r\n\r\n“And what year?”\r\n\r\n“1866.”\r\n\r\n“Twelve years! Twelve years!” he cried, and then turned quickly away.\r\n\r\nHerbert related this incident to the others.\r\n\r\n“The poor creature knew neither the month nor the year,” remarked\r\nSpilett.\r\n\r\n“And he had been twelve years on the island, when we found him.”\r\n\r\n“Twelve years,” said Smith. “Twelve years of isolation, after a wicked\r\nlife, perhaps; that would indeed affect a man’s reason.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot help thinking,” observed Pencroff, “that this man was not\r\nwrecked on that island, but that he has been left there for some\r\ncrime.”\r\n\r\n“You may be right, Pencroff,” replied the reporter, “and if that is the\r\ncase, it is not impossible that whoever left him there may return for\r\nhim some day.”\r\n\r\n“And they would not find him,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“But, then,” exclaimed Pencroff, “he would want to go back, and—”\r\n\r\n“My friends,” interrupted Smith, “do not let us discuss this question\r\ntill we know what we are talking about. I believe that this unhappy man\r\nhas suffered, and that he has paid bitterly for his faults, whatever\r\nthey may have been, and that he is struggling with the need of opening\r\nhis heart to someone. Do not provoke him to speak; he will tell us of\r\nhis own accord some day, and when we have learned all, we will see what\r\ncourse it will be necessary to follow. He alone can tell us if he has\r\nmore than the hope, the certainty of some day being restored to his\r\ncountry, but I doubt it.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Because, had he been sure of being delivered after a fixed time, he\r\nwould have awaited the hour of his deliverance, and not have thrown\r\nthat paper in the sea. No, it is more likely that be was condemned to\r\ndie upon this island, to never look upon his kind again.”\r\n\r\n“But there still is something which I cannot understand,” said the\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Why, if this man had been left on Tabor Island twelve years ago, it\r\nseems probable that he must have been in this savage condition for a\r\nlong time.”\r\n\r\n“That is probable,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“And, therefore, it is a long time since he wrote that paper.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless—and yet that paper seemed to have been written recently—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and how account for the bottle taking so many years in coming\r\nfrom Tabor Island here?”\r\n\r\n“It is not absolutely impossible,” responded the reporter. “Could not\r\nit have been in the neighborhood of the island for a long time?”\r\n\r\n“And have remained floating? No,” answered the sailor, “for sooner or\r\nlater it would have been dashed to pieces on the rocks.”\r\n\r\n“It would, indeed,” said Smith, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“And, moreover,” continued the sailor, if the paper had been enclosed\r\nin the bottle for a long time, it would have been injured by the\r\nmoisture, whereas, it was not damaged in the least.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor’s remark was just, and, moreover, this paper, recently\r\nwritten, gave the situation of the island with an exactness which\r\nimplied a knowledge of hydrography, such as a simple sailor could not\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n“There is, as I said before, something inexplicable in all this,” said\r\nthe engineer, “but do not let us urge our new companion to speak, When\r\nhe wishes it we will be ready to listen.”\r\n\r\nFor several days after this the Unknown neither spoke nor left the\r\nplateau. He worked incessantly, digging in the garden apart from the\r\ncolonists, and at meal times, although he was often asked to join them,\r\nhe remained alone, eating but a few uncooked vegetables. At night,\r\ninstead of returning to his room in Granite House, he slept under the\r\ntrees, or hid himself, if the weather was bad, in some hollow of the\r\nrocks. Thus he returned again to that manner of life in which he had\r\nlived when he had no other shelter than the forests of Tabor Island,\r\nand all endeavor to make him modify this life having proved fruitless,\r\nthe colonists waited patiently. But the moment came when, irresistibly\r\nand as if involuntarily forced from him by his conscience, the terrible\r\navowals were made.\r\n\r\nAt dusk on the evening of the 10th of November, as the colonists were\r\nseated in the arbor, the Unknown stood suddenly before them. His eyes\r\nglowed, and his whole appearance wore again the savage aspect of former\r\ndays. He stood there, swayed by some terrible emotion, his teeth\r\nchattering like those of a person in a fever. The colonists were\r\nastounded. “What was the matter with him? Was the sight of his\r\nfellow-creatures unendurable? Had he had enough of this honest life?\r\nWas he homesick for his brutish life? One would have thought so,\r\nhearing him give utterance to these incoherent phrases:-\r\n\r\n“Why am I here? By what right did you drag me from my island? Is there\r\nany bond between you and me? Do you know who I am—what I have done—why\r\nI was there—alone? And who has told you that I was not abandoned—that I\r\nwas not condemned to die there? Do you know my past? Do you know\r\nwhether I have not robbed, murdered—if I am not a miserable—a wicked\r\nbeing—fit to live like a wild beast—far from all—say—do you know?”\r\n\r\nThe colonists listened silently to the unhappy creature, from whom\r\nthese half avowals came in spite of himself. Smith, wishing to soothe\r\nhim, would have gone to him, but the Unknown drew back quickly.\r\n\r\n“No! no!” he cried. “One word only—am I free?”.\r\n\r\n“You are free,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Then, good-bye!” he cried, rushing off.\r\n\r\nNeb, Pencroff, and Herbert ran to the border of the wood, but they\r\nreturned alone.\r\n\r\n“We must let him have his own way,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“He will never come back,” exclaimed Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“He will return,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\nAnd after that conversation many days passed, but Smith—was it a\r\npresentiment—persisted in the fixed idea that the unhappy man would\r\nreturn sooner or later.\r\n\r\n“It is the last struggle of this rude nature, which is touched by\r\nremorse, and which would be terrified by a new isolation.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, work of all kinds was continued, both on Prospect\r\nPlateau and at the corral, where Smith proposed to make a farm. It is\r\nneedless to say that the seeds brought from Tabor Island had been\r\ncarefully sown. The plateau was a great kitchen-garden, well laid out\r\nand enclosed, which kept the colonists always busy. As the plants\r\nmultiplied, it was necessary to increase the size of the beds, which\r\nthreatened to become fields, and to take the place of the grass land.\r\nBut as forage abounded in other parts of the island, there was no fear\r\nof the onagers having to be placed on rations; and it was also better\r\nto make Prospect Plateau, defended by its belt of creeks, a garden of\r\nthis kind, and to extend the fields, which required no protection,\r\nbeyond the belt.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of November they made their third harvest. Here was a field\r\nwhich had indeed increased in the eighteen months since the first grain\r\nof corn had been sown. The second crop of 600,000 grains produced this\r\ntime 4,000 bushels or more than 500,000,000 grains. The colonists were,\r\ntherefore, rich in corn; as it was only necessary to sow a dozen\r\nbushels each year in order to have a supply sufficient for the\r\nnourishment of man and beast.\r\n\r\nAfter harvesting they, gave up the last fortnight in the month to\r\nbread-making. They had the grain but not the flour, and a mill was\r\ntherefore necessary. Smith could have used the other waterfall which\r\nfell into the Mercy, but, after discussing the question, it was decided\r\nto build a simple wind-mill on the summit of the plateau. Its\r\nconstruction would be no more difficult than a water-mill, and they\r\nwould be sure of always having a breeze on this open elevation.\r\n\r\n“Without counting,” said Pencroff, “the fine aspect a wind-mill will\r\ngive to the landscape.”\r\n\r\nThey began the work by selecting timber for the cage and machinery for\r\nthe mill. Some large sand-stones, which the colonists found to the\r\nnorth of the lake, were readily made into mill-stones, and the\r\ninexhaustible envelope of the balloon furnished the cloth necessary for\r\nthe sails.\r\n\r\nSmith made his drawings, and the site for the mill was chosen a little\r\nto the right of the poultry-yard, and close to the lake shore. The\r\nwhole cage rested upon a pivot, held in position by heavy timbers, in\r\nsuch a manner that it could turn, with all the mechanism within it,\r\ntowards any quarter of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe work progressed rapidly. Neb and Herbert had become expert\r\ncarpenters, and had only to follow the plans furnished by the engineer,\r\nso that in a very short time a sort of round watch-house, a regular\r\npepper-box, surmounted by a sharp roof, rose upon the site selected.\r\nThe four wings had been firmly fastened by iron tenons to the main\r\nshaft, in such a manner as to make a certain angle with it. As for the\r\nvarious parts of the interior mechanism—the two mill-stones, the runner\r\nand the feeder; the hopper, a sort of huge square trough, large above\r\nand small below, permitting the grains to fall upon the mill-stones;\r\nthe oscillating bucket, designed to regulate the passage of the grain;\r\nand, finally, the bolter, which, by the operation of the sieve,\r\nseparated the bran from the flour—all these were easily made. And as\r\ntheir tools were good, the work simple, and everybody took part in it,\r\nthe mill was finished by the 1st of December.\r\n\r\nAs usual, Pencroff was overjoyed by his work, and he was sure that the\r\nmachine was perfection.\r\n\r\n“Now, with a good wind, we will merrily grind our corn.”\r\n\r\n“Let it be a good wind, Pencroff, but not too strong,” said the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n“Bah! our mill will turn the faster.”\r\n\r\n“It is not necessary to turn rapidly,” replied the engineer.\r\n“Experience has demonstrated that the best results are obtained by a\r\nmill whose wings make six times the number of turns in a minute that\r\nthe wind travels feet in a second. Thus, an ordinary wind, which\r\ntravels twenty-four feet in a second, will turn the wings of the mill\r\nsixteen times in a minute, which is fast enough.”\r\n\r\n“Already!” exclaimed Herbert, “there is a fine breeze from the\r\nnortheast, which will be just the thing!”\r\n\r\nThere was no reason to delay using the mill, and the colonists were\r\nanxious to taste the bread of Lincoln Island; so this very morning two\r\nor three bushels of corn were ground, and the next day, at breakfast, a\r\nsplendid loaf, rather heavy perhaps, which had been raised with the\r\nbarm of beer, was displayed upon the table of Granite House. Each\r\nmunched his portion with a pleasure perfectly inexpressible.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Unknown had not come back again. Often Spilett and Herbert\r\nhad searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite House without\r\nfinding any trace of him, and all began to be seriously alarmed at his\r\nprolonged absence. Undoubtedly the former savage of Tabor Island would\r\nnot find it difficult to live in the forests of the Far West, which\r\nwere so rich in game; but was it not to be feared that he would resume\r\nhis former habits, and that his independence would revive in him his\r\nbrutish instincts? Smith alone, by a sort of presentiment, persisted in\r\nsaying that the fugitive would return.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he will come back,” he repeated with a confidence in which his\r\ncompanions could not share. “When this poor creature was on Tabor\r\nIsland, he knew he was alone, but here, he knows that his kindred await\r\nhim. Since he half-spoke of his past life, he will return to tell us\r\neverything, and on that day he will be ours.”\r\n\r\nThe event proved the correctness of Cyrus Smith’s reasoning.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of December, Herbert had gone to the southern shore of the\r\nlake, to fish, and, since the dangerous animals never showed themselves\r\nin this part of the island, he had gone unarmed.\r\n\r\nPencroff and Neb were working in the poultry-yard, while Smith and the\r\nreporter were occupied at the Chimneys making soda, the supply of soap\r\nbeing low.\r\n\r\nSuddenly sharp cries of help were heard by Neb and Pencroff, who\r\nsummoned the others, and all rushed towards the lake.\r\n\r\nBut before them, the Unknown, whose presence in the neighborhood had\r\nnot been suspected, leapt over Glycerine Creek and bounded along the\r\nopposite bank.\r\n\r\nThere, Herbert stood facing a powerful jaguar, like the one which had\r\nbeen killed at Reptile End. Taken by surprise, he stood with his back\r\nagainst a tree, and the animal, crouching on his haunches, was about to\r\nspring upon him, when the Unknown, with no other arm than his knife,\r\nthrew himself on the brute, which turned upon its new adversary.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was short. This man, whose strength and agility was\r\nprodigious, seized the jaguar by the throat in a vice-like grip, and,\r\nnot heeding the claws of the beast tearing his flesh, he thrust his\r\nknife into its heart.\r\n\r\nThe jaguar fell, and the Unknown was about turning to go away, when the\r\ncolonists came up, and Herbert, catching hold of him, exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“No, no, you must not leave us!”\r\n\r\nSmith walked towards the man, who frowned at his approach. The blood\r\nwas flowing from a wound in his shoulder, but he did not heed it.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Smith, “we are in your debt. You have risked your\r\nlife to save our boy.”\r\n\r\n“My life,” murmured the Unknown; “what is it worth? less than nothing.”\r\n\r\n“You are wounded?”\r\n\r\n“That does not matter.”\r\n\r\n“Will you not shake hands with me?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\nBut on the lad’s seeking to take his hand, the Unknown folded his arms,\r\nhis chest heaved, and he looked about as if he wished to escape; but,\r\nmaking a violent effort at self-control, and in a gruff voice:—\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked, “and what are you going to do with me?”\r\n\r\nIt was their history that he thus asked for, for the first time.\r\nPerhaps, if that was related, he would tell his own. So Smith, in a few\r\nwords, recounted all that had happened since their departure from\r\nRichmond; how they had succeeded, and the resources now at their\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown listened with the utmost attention.\r\n\r\nThen Smith told him who they all were, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroff, Neb,\r\nhimself, and he added that the greatest happiness that had come to them\r\nsince their arrival on Lincoln Island was on their return from the\r\nislet, when they could count one more companion.\r\n\r\nAt these words the other colored up, and bowing his head, seemed\r\ngreatly agitated.\r\n\r\n“And now that you know us,” asked Smith, “will you give us your hand?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the Unknown in a hoarse voice; “no! You are honest men.\r\nBut I—”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nALWAYS APART—A BEQUEST OF THE UNKNOWN’S—THE FARM ESTABLISHED AT THE\r\nCORRAL—TWELVE YEARS—THE BOATSWAIN’S MATE OF THE BRITANNIA —LEFT ON\r\nTABOR ISLAND—THE HAND OF SMITH—THE MYSTERIOUS PAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nThese last events justified the presentiments of the colonists. There\r\nwas some terrible past in the life of this man, expiated, perhaps, in\r\nthe eyes of men, but which his conscience still held unabsolved. At any\r\nrate, he felt remorse; he had repented, and his new friends would have\r\ncordially grasped that hand, but he did not feel himself worthy to\r\noffer it to honest men. Nevertheless, after the struggle with the\r\njaguar, he did not go back to the forest, but remained within the\r\nbounds of Granite House.\r\n\r\nWhat was the mystery of this life? Would he speak of it some day? The\r\ncolonists thought so, but they agreed that, under no circumstances,\r\nwould they ask him for his secret; and, in the meantime, to associate\r\nwith him as if they suspected nothing.\r\n\r\nFor some days everything went on as usual. Smith and Spilett worked\r\ntogether, sometimes as chemists, sometimes as physicists, the reporter\r\nnever leaving the engineer, except to hunt with Herbert, as it was not\r\nprudent to allow the young lad to traverse the forest alone. As to Neb\r\nand Pencroff, the work in the stables and poultry-yard, or at the\r\ncorral, besides the chores about Granite House, kept them busy.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown worked apart from the others. He had gone back to his\r\nformer habit of taking no share in the meals, of sleeping under the\r\ntrees, of having nothing to do with his companions. It seemed, indeed,\r\nas if the society of those who had saved him was intolerable.\r\n\r\n“But why, then,” asked Pencroff, “did he seek succor from his\r\nfellow-creatures; why did he throw this paper in the sea?”\r\n\r\n“He will tell us everything,” was Smith’s invariable answer.\r\n\r\n“But when?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps sooner than you think, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, on the 10th of December, a week after his return to\r\nGranite House, the Unknown accosted the engineer and in a quiet humble\r\nvoice said:—\r\n\r\n“Sir, I have a request to make.”\r\n\r\n“Speak,” replied the engineer, “but, first, let me ask you a question?”\r\n\r\nAt these words the Unknown colored and drew back. Smith saw what was\r\npassing in the mind of the culprit, who feared, doubtless, that the\r\nengineer would question him upon his past.\r\n\r\nSmith took him by the hand.\r\n\r\n“Comrade,” said he, “we are not only companions, we are friends. I\r\nwanted to say this to you first, now I will listen.”\r\n\r\nThe Unknown covered his eyes with his hand; a sort of tremor seized\r\nhim, and for some moments he was unable to articulate a word.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, at length, “I came to implore a favor from you.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“You have, four or five miles from here, at the foot of the mountain, a\r\ncorral for your animals. These require looking after. Will you permit\r\nme to live over there with them?”\r\n\r\nSmith regarded the unhappy man for some time, with deep commiseration.\r\nThen:—\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said he, “the corral has nothing but sheds, only fit for\r\nthe animals—”\r\n\r\n“It will be good enough, for me, sir.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” replied Smith, “we will never thwart you in anything. If\r\nyou wish to live in the corral, you may; nevertheless, you will always\r\nbe welcome at Granite House. But since you desire to stay at the\r\ncorral, we will do what is necessary to make you comfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind about that, I will get along well enough.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” responded Smith, who persisted in the use of this cordial\r\ntitle, “you must let us be the judges in that matter.”\r\n\r\nThe Unknown thanked the engineer and went away. And Smith, having told\r\nhis companions of the proposition that had been made, they decided to\r\nbuild a log house at the corral, and to make it as comfortable as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe same day the colonists went, with the necessary tools, to the\r\nplace, and before the week was out the house was ready for its guest.\r\nIt was built twenty feet from the sheds, at a place where the herd of\r\nmoufflons, now numbering twenty-four animals, could be easily\r\noverlooked. Some furniture, including a bed, table, bench,\r\nclothes-press, and chest was made, and some arms, ammunition, and\r\ntools, were carried there.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown, meanwhile, had not seen his new home, letting the\r\ncolonists work without him, while he remained at the plateau, wishing,\r\ndoubtless, to finish up his work there. And, indeed, by his exertion\r\nthe ground was completely tilled, and ready for the sowing when the\r\ntime should arrive.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th everything was prepared at the corral, aid the engineer\r\ntold the Unknown that his house was ready for him, to which the other\r\nreplied that he would sleep there that night.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, the colonists were all together in the great hall of\r\nGranite House. It was 8 o’clock, the time of their companion’s\r\ndeparture; and not wishing by their presence to impose on him the\r\nleave-taking, which would, perhaps, have cost him an effort, they had\r\nleft him alone and gone up into Granite House.\r\n\r\nThey had been conversing together in the hall for some minutes, when\r\nthere was a light knock on the door, the Unknown entered, and without\r\nfurther introduction:—\r\n\r\n“Before I leave you, sirs,” said he, “it is well that you should know\r\nmy history. This is it.”\r\n\r\nThese simple words greatly affected Smith and companions. The engineer\r\nstarted up.\r\n\r\n“We ask to hear nothing, my friend,” he said. “It is your right to be\r\nsilent—”\r\n\r\n“It is my duty to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Then sit down.”\r\n\r\n“I will stand where I am.”\r\n\r\n“We are ready to hear what you have to say,” said Smith.\r\n\r\nThe Unknown stood in a shadowed corner of the hall, bare-headed, his\r\narms crossed on his breast. In this position, in a hoarse voice,\r\nspeaking as one who forces himself to speak, he made the following\r\nrecital, uninterrupted by any word from his auditors:—\r\n\r\n“On the 20th of December, 1854, a steam pleasure-yacht, the Duncan,\r\nbelonging to a Scotch nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, cast anchor at Cape\r\nBernoulli, on the western coast of Australia, near the thirty-seventh\r\nparallel. On board the yacht were Lord Glenarvan, his wife, a major in\r\nthe English army, a French geographer, a little boy, and a little girl.\r\nThese two last were the children of Captain Grant, of the ship\r\nBritannia, which, with its cargo, had been lost the year before. The\r\nDuncan was commanded by Captain John Mangles, and was manned by a crew\r\nof fifteen men.\r\n\r\n“This is the reason why the yacht was on the Australian coast at that\r\nseason:—\r\n\r\n“Six months before, a bottle containing a paper written in English,\r\nGerman, and French, had been picked up by the Duncan in the Irish Sea.\r\nThis paper said, in substance, that three persons still survived from\r\nthe wreck of the Britannia; that they were the captain and two of the\r\nmen; that they had found refuge on a land of which the latitude and\r\nlongitude was given, but the longitude, blotted by the sea water, was\r\nno longer legible.\r\n\r\n“The latitude was 37° 11’ south. Now, as the longitude was unknown, if\r\nthey followed the latitude across continents and seas, they were\r\ncertain to arrive at the land inhabited by Captain Grant and his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n“The English Admiralty, having hesitated to undertake the search, Lord\r\nGlenarvan had resolved to do everything in his power to recover the\r\ncaptain. Mary and Robert Grant had been in correspondence with him, and\r\nthe yacht Duncan was made ready for a long voyage, in which the family\r\nof Lord Glenarvan and the children of the captain intended to\r\nparticipate. The Duncan, leaving Glasgow, crossed the Atlantic, passed\r\nthe Straits of Magellan, and proceeded up the Pacific to Patagonia,\r\nwhere, according to the first theory suggested by the paper, they might\r\nbelieve that Captain Grant was a prisoner to the natives.\r\n\r\n“The Duncan left its passengers on the western coast of Patagonia, and\r\nsailed for Cape Corrientes on the eastern coast, there to wait for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Lord Glenarvan crossed Patagonia, following the 37th parallel, and,\r\nnot having found any trace of the captain, he reembarked on the 13th of\r\nNovember, in order to continue his search across the ocean.\r\n\r\n“After having visited without success the islands of Tristan d’Acunha\r\nand of Amsterdam, lying in the course, the Duncan, as I have stated,\r\narrived at Cape Bernouilli on the 20th of December, 1854.\r\n\r\n“It was Lord Glenarvan’s intention to cross Australia, as he had\r\ncrossed Patagonia, and he disembarked. Some miles from the coast was a\r\nfarm belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to the\r\ntravellers. Lord Glenarvan told the Irishman the object which had\r\nbrought him to that region, and asked if he had heard of an English\r\nthree-master, the Britannia, having been lost, within two years, on the\r\nwest coast of Australia.\r\n\r\n“The Irishman had never heard of this disaster, but, to the great\r\nsurprise of everybody, one of his servants, intervening, said:—\r\n\r\n“‘Heaven be praised, my lord. If Captain Grant is still alive he is in\r\nAustralia.’\r\n\r\n“‘Who are you?’ demanded Lord Glenarvan.\r\n\r\n“‘A Scotchman, like yourself, my lord,’ answered this man, ‘and one of\r\nthe companions of Captain Grant, one of the survivors of the\r\nBritannia.’\r\n\r\n“This man called himself Ayrton. He had been, in short, boatswain’s\r\nmate of the Britannia, as his papers proved. But, separated from\r\nCaptain Grant at the moment when the ship went to pieces on the rocks,\r\nhe had believed until this moment that every one had perished but\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“‘Only,’ he added, ‘it was not on the western but on the eastern coast\r\nof Australia that the Britannia was lost; and if the Captain is still\r\nliving he is a prisoner to the natives, and he must be searched for\r\nthere.’\r\n\r\n“This man said these things frankly and with a confident expression. No\r\none would have doubted what he said. The Irishman, in whose service he\r\nhad been for more than a year, spoke in his favor. Lord Glenarvan\r\nbelieved in his loyalty, and, following his advice, he resolved to\r\ncross Australia, following the 37th parallel. Lord Glenarvan, his wife,\r\nthe children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain Mangles and some\r\nsailors formed the little party under the guidance of Ayrton, while the\r\nDuncan, under the command of the mate, Tom Austin, went to Melbourne,\r\nto await further instructions.\r\n\r\n“They left on the 23d of December, 1861.\r\n\r\n“It is time to say that this Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed, the\r\nboatswain’s mate of the Britannia; but, after some dispute with his\r\ncaptain, he had tried to excite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship,\r\nand Captain Grant had put him ashore, the 8th of April, 1832, on the\r\nwest coast of Australia, and had gone off, leaving him there, which was\r\nno more than right.\r\n\r\n“Thus this wretch knew nothing of the shipwreck of the Britannia. He\r\nhad just learned it from Lord Glenarvan’s recital! Since his\r\nabandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of\r\nsome escaped convicts; and, if he impudently asserted the ship had been\r\nlost on the east coast, if he urged Lord Glenarvan to go in that\r\ndirection, it was in the hope of separating him from his ship, of\r\nseizing the Duncan, and of making this yacht a pirate of the Pacific.”\r\n\r\nHere the Unknown stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but he began\r\nagain in these words:—\r\n\r\n“The expedition across Australia set out. It was naturally unfortunate,\r\nsince Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, whichever you wish, led it, sometimes\r\npreceded, sometimes followed by the band of convicts, who had been\r\ninformed of the plot.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, the Duncan had been taken to Melbourne to await\r\ninstructions. It was therefore necessary to persuade Lord Glenarvan to\r\norder her to leave Melbourne and to proceed to the east coast of\r\nAustralia, where it would be easy to seize her. After having led the\r\nexpedition sufficiently near this coast, into the midst of vast\r\nforests, where all resources were wanting, Ayrton obtained a letter\r\nwhich he was ordered to deliver to the mate of the Duncan; a letter\r\nwhich gave the order directing the yacht to proceed immediately to the\r\neast coast, to Twofold Bay, a place some days journey from the spot\r\nwhere the expedition had halted. It was at this place that Ayrton had\r\ngiven the rendezvous to his accomplices.\r\n\r\n“At the moment when this letter was to have been sent, the traitor was\r\nunmasked and was obliged to flee. But this letter, giving him the\r\nDuncan, must be had at any cost. Ayrton succeeded in getting hold of\r\nit, and, in two days afterwards, he was in Melbourne.\r\n\r\n“So far, the criminal had succeeded in his odious projects. He could\r\ntake the Duncan to this Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the\r\nconvicts to seize her; and, her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would be\r\nmaster of the sea. Heaven stopped him in the consummation of these dark\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton, having reached Melbourne, gave the letter to the mate, Tom\r\nAustin, who made ready to execute the order; but one can judge of the\r\ndisappointment and the rage of Ayrton, when, the second day out, he\r\nlearned that the mate was taking the ship, not to Twofold Bay on the\r\neast coast of Australia, but to the east coast of New Zealand. He\r\nwished to oppose this, but the mate showed him his order. And, in\r\ntruth, by a providential error of the French geographer who had written\r\nthis letter, the eastern coast of New Zealand had been named as their\r\nplace of destination.\r\n\r\n“All the plans of Ayrton had miscarried. He tried to mutiny. They put\r\nhim in irons; and he was taken to the coast of New Zealand, unaware of\r\nwhat had become of his accomplices, or of Lord Glenarvan.\r\n\r\n“The Duncan remained on this coast until the 3d of March. On that day,\r\nAyrton heard firing. It was a salute from the Duncan, and, very soon,\r\nLord Glenarvan and all his party came on board.\r\n\r\n“This is what had happened:—\r\n\r\n“After innumerable fatigues and dangers, Lord Glenarvan had been able\r\nto accomplish his journey and arrived at Twofold Bay. The Duncan was\r\nnot there! He telegraphed to Melbourne, and received a reply:—’Duncan\r\nsailed on the 18th. Destination unknown.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Glenarvan could think of but one explanation, that was that the\r\ngood yacht had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a\r\npirate ship.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan did not wish to give up his undertaking.\r\nHe was an intrepid and a generous man. He embarked on a merchant\r\nvessel, which took him to the west coast of New Zealand, and he crossed\r\nthe country, following the 37th parallel without finding any trace of\r\nCaptain Grant; but on the other coast, to his great surprise, and by\r\nthe bounty of Heaven, he found the Duncan, commanded by the mate, which\r\nhad been waiting for him for five weeks!\r\n\r\n“It was the 3d of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was again on the Duncan,\r\nbut Ayrton was there also. He was brought before his lordship, who\r\nwished to get from this bandit all that he knew concerning Captain\r\nGrant. Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan told him, then, that at\r\nthe first port, he would be given over to the English authorities.\r\nAyrton remained silent.\r\n\r\n“The Duncan continued along the thirty-seventh parallel. Meanwhile,\r\nLady Glenarvan undertook to overcome the obstinacy of the bandit, and,\r\nfinally, her influence conquered him. Ayrton, in exchange for what he\r\nwould tell, proposed to Lord Glenarvan to leave him upon one of the\r\nislands in the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English\r\nauthorities. Lord Glenarvan, ready to do anything to gain information\r\nconcerning Captain Grant, consented.\r\n\r\n“Then Ayrton told the history of his life, and declared that he knew\r\nnothing about Captain Grant since the day when the latter had left him\r\non the Australian coast.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise he had made. The Duncan,\r\ncontinuing her route, arrived at Tabor Island. It was there that Ayrton\r\nwas to be left, and it was there, too, that, by a miracle, they found\r\nCaptain Grant and his two companions. The convict was put upon the\r\nisland in their stead, and when he left the yacht, Lord Glenarvan spoke\r\nto him in these words:—\r\n\r\n“‘Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any country, and without any\r\npossible means of communicating with your fellow-men. You will not be\r\nable to leave this island. You will be alone, under the eye of a God\r\nwho looks into the depths of our hearts, but you will neither be lost\r\nnor neglected, like Captain Grant. Unworthy as you are of the\r\nremembrance of men, you will be remembered. I know where you are,\r\nAyrton, and I know where to find you. I will never forget it.’\r\n\r\n“And the Duncan, setting sail, soon disappeared.\r\n\r\n“This was the 18th of March, 1855.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton was alone; but he lacked neither ammunition nor arms nor seeds.\r\nHe, the convict, had at his disposal the house built by the honest\r\nCaptain Grant. He had only to live and to expiate in solitude the\r\ncrimes which he had committed.\r\n\r\n“Sirs, he repented; he was ashamed of his crimes, and he was very\r\nunhappy. He said to himself that, as some day men would come to seek\r\nhim on this islet, he must make himself worthy to go back with them.\r\nHow he suffered, the miserable man! How he labored to benefit himself\r\nby labor! How he prayed to regenerate himself by prayer!\r\n\r\n“For two years, for three years, it was thus. Ayrton, crushed by this\r\nisolation, ever on the watch for a ship to appear upon the horizon of\r\nhis island, asking himself if the time of expiation was nearly ended,\r\nsuffered as one has rarely suffered. Oh! but solitude is hard, for a\r\nsoul gnawed by remorse!\r\n\r\n“But, doubtless, Heaven found this unhappy wretch insufficiently\r\npunished, for he fell, little by little, till he became a savage! He\r\nfelt, little by little, the brute nature taking possession of him. He\r\ncannot say whether this was after two or four years of\r\n\r\nabandonment, but at last he became the miserable being whom you found.\r\n\r\n“I need not tell you, sirs, that Ayrton and Ben Joyce and I are one!”\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions rose as this recital was finished. It is hard\r\nto say how deeply they were affected! Such misery, such grief, and such\r\ndespair, had been shown to them!\r\n\r\n“Ayrton,” said Smith, “you have been a great criminal, but Heaven has,\r\ndoubtless, witnessed the expiation of your crimes. This is proved, in\r\nthat you have been restored to your fellow-men. Ayrton, you are\r\npardoned! And now, will you be our companion?”\r\n\r\nThe man drew back.\r\n\r\n“Here is my hand,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\nAyrton darted forward and seized it, great tears streaming from his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Do you desire to live with us?” asked Smith.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Smith, let me have yet a little time,” he answered, “let me\r\nremain alone in the house at the corral!”\r\n\r\n“Do as you wish, Ayrton,” responded Smith.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy man was about retiring, when Smith asked him a last\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“One word more, my friend. Since it is your wish to live in solitude,\r\nwhy did you throw that paper, which put us in the way of finding you,\r\ninto the sea?”\r\n\r\n“A paper?” answered Ayrton, who seemed not to understand what was said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that paper, which we found enclosed in a bottle, and which gave\r\nthe exact situation of Tabor Island?”\r\n\r\nThe man put his hand to his forehead, and, after some reflection,\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n“I never threw any paper into the sea!”\r\n\r\n“Never!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\nAnd then, inclining his head, Ayrton left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALK—SMITH AND SPILETT—THE ENGINEER’S IDEA—THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH—THE\r\nWIRES—THE BATTER-THE ALPHABET—FINE WEATHER—THE PROSPERITY OF THE\r\nCOLONY—PHOTOGRAPHY—A SNOW EFFECT—TWO YEARS ON LINCOLN ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The poor man!” said Herbert, returning from the door, after having\r\nwatched Ayrton slide down the rope of the elevator and disappear in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n“He will come back,” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?” exclaimed Pencroff. “That he had not thrown this\r\nbottle into the sea? Then who did it?”\r\n\r\nCertainly, if there was a reasonable question this was.\r\n\r\n“He did it,” replied Neb; “only the poor fellow was half out of his\r\nsenses at the time.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Herbert, “and he had no knowledge of what he was doing.”\r\n\r\n“It can be explained in no other way, my friends,” responded Smith,\r\nhurriedly, “and I understand, now, how Ayrton was able to give the\r\nexact situation of the island, since the events prior to his\r\nabandonment gave him that knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” observed Pencroff, “he was not a brute when he wrote\r\nthat paper, and if it is seven or eight years since it was thrown into\r\nthe sea, how is it that the paper has not been injured by moisture?”\r\n\r\n“It proves,” said Smith, “that Ayrton retained possession of his\r\nfaculties to a period much more recent than he imagines.”\r\n\r\n“That must be it,” replied Pencroff, “for otherwise the thing would be\r\ninexplicable.”\r\n\r\n“Inexplicable, indeed,” answered the engineer, who seemed not to wish\r\nto prolong this talk.\r\n\r\n“Has Ayrton told the truth?” questioned the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the reporter, “the history he has related is true in\r\nevery particular. I remember, perfectly well, that the papers reported\r\nLord Glenarvan’s undertaking and its result.”\r\n\r\n“Ayrton has told the truth,” added Smith, “without any doubt, Pencroff,\r\nsince it was trying enough for him to do so. A man does not lie when he\r\naccuses himself in this way.”\r\n\r\nThe next day—the 21st—the colonists went down to the beach, and then\r\nclambered up to the plateau, but they saw nothing of Ayrton. The man\r\nhad gone to his house the night before, and they judged it best not to\r\nintrude upon him. Time would, doubtless, effect what sympathy would\r\nfail to accomplish.\r\n\r\nHerbert, Pencroff, and Neb resumed their accustomed occupations; and it\r\nhappened that their work brought Smith and Spilett together at the\r\nChimneys.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Cyrus, that your explanation of yesterday about the\r\nbottle does not satisfy me at all? It is impossible to suppose that\r\nthis unhappy creature could have written that paper, and thrown the\r\nbottle into the sea, without remembering anything about it!”\r\n\r\n“Consequently, it is not he who threw it there, my dear Spilett!”\r\n\r\n“Then you believe—”\r\n\r\n“I believe nothing, I know nothing!” replied Smith, interrupting the\r\nreporter. “I place this incident with those others which I have not\r\nbeen able to explain!”\r\n\r\n“In truth, Cyrus,” said Spilett, “these things are incredible. Your\r\nrescue, the box thrown up on the beach, Top’s adventures, and now this\r\nbottle. Will we never have an answer to these enigmas?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the engineer, earnestly, “yes, when I shall have\r\npenetrated the bowels of this island!”\r\n\r\n“Chance will, perhaps, give us the key to this mystery.”\r\n\r\n“Chance, Spilett! I do not believe in chance any more than I believe in\r\nmystery in this world. There is a cause for everything, however\r\ninexplicable, which has happened here, and I will discover it. But,\r\nwhile waiting, let us watch and work.”\r\n\r\nJanuary arrived, and the year 1867 began. The works had been pushed\r\nforward vigorously. One day Herbert and Spilett, passing the corral,\r\nascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of his abode. He occupied\r\nhimself with the large herd confided to his care, and thus saved his\r\ncompanions the necessity of visiting it two or three times a week.\r\nNevertheless, in order not to leave Ayrton too much alone, they\r\nfrequently went there.\r\n\r\nIt was just as well—owing to certain suspicions shared by Smith and\r\nSpilett—that this part of the island should be under a certain\r\nsupervision, and Ayrton, if anything happened, would not fail to let\r\nthe inhabitants of Granite House know of it.\r\n\r\nPossibly, some sudden event might happen, which it would be important\r\nto communicate to the engineer without delay. And, aside from whatever\r\nmight be connected with the mystery of the island, other things,\r\nrequiring the prompt intervention of the colonists, might occur, as,\r\nfor example, the discovering of a ship in the offing and in sight of\r\nthe west coast, a wreck on that shore, the possible arrival of pirates,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSo Smith determined to place the corral in instant communication with\r\nGranite House.\r\n\r\nIt was the 10th of January when he told his project to his companions.\r\n\r\n“How are you going to do such a thing as that, Mr. Smith?” asked\r\nPencroff. “Maybe you propose to erect a telegraph!”\r\n\r\n“That is precisely what I propose to do.”\r\n\r\n“Electric?” exclaimed Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Electric,” responded Smith. “We have everything necessary for making a\r\nbattery, and the most difficult part will be to make the wires, but I\r\nthink we can succeed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, after this,” replied the sailor, “I expect some day to see us\r\nriding along on a railway!”\r\n\r\nThey entered upon the work at once, beginning with the most difficult\r\npart, that is to say, the manufacture of the wires, since, if that\r\nfailed, it would be useless to make the battery and other accessories.\r\n\r\nThe iron of Lincoln Island was, as we know, of excellent quality, and,\r\ntherefore, well adapted to the purpose. Smith began by making a steel\r\nplate, pierced with conical holes of different sizes, which would bring\r\nthe wire to the desired size. This piece of steel, after having been\r\ntempered “through and through,” was fixed firmly to a solid frame-work\r\nsunk in the ground, only a few feet distant from the waterfall—the\r\nmotive power which the engineer intended to use.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, there was the fulling-mill, not then in use, the main\r\nshaft of which turned with great force, and would serve to draw out the\r\nwire and roll it around itself.\r\n\r\nThe operation was delicate and required great care. The iron,\r\npreviously made into long and thin bars, with tapering ends, having\r\nbeen introduced into the largest hole of the drawing-plate, was drawn\r\nout by the main shaft of the mill, rolled out to a length of 25 or 30\r\nfeet, then unrolled, and pulled, in turn, through the smaller holes;\r\nand at length, the engineer obtained wires 30 or 40 feet long, which it\r\nwas easy to join together and place along the five miles between the\r\ncorral and Granite House.\r\n\r\nIt took but a little while to get this work under way, and then, Smith,\r\nmaking his companions the wire-drawers, busied himself in the\r\nconstruction of his battery.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to make a battery with a constant circuit. We know\r\nthat modern batteries are usually made of a certain kind of coke, zinc,\r\nand copper. Copper the engineer was without, since, in spite of all his\r\nefforts, he had been unable to find a trace of it on the island. The\r\ncoke, which is that hard deposit obtained from gas retorts could be\r\nprocured, but it would be necessary to arrange a special apparatus—a\r\ndifficult thing to do. As to the zinc, it will be remembered that the\r\nbox found on Jetsam Point, was lined with a sheet of that metal, which\r\ncould not be better utilized than at present.\r\n\r\nSmith, after deep reflection, resolved to make a very simple battery,\r\nsomething like that which Becquerel invented in 1820, in which zinc\r\nalone is used. The other substances, nitric-acid and potash, he had at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which he made this battery, in which the current was\r\nproduced by the action of the acid and the potash on each other, was as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\nA certain number of glass vessels were made and filled with\r\nnitric-acid. They were corked with perforated corks, containing glass\r\ntubes reaching into the acid, and stopped: with clay plugs, connected\r\nwith threads. Into these tubes the engineer poured a solution of\r\npotash—obtained from burnt plants—and thus the acid and the potash\r\nreacted on each other through the clay.\r\n\r\nThen Smith plunged two plates of zinc, the one in the nitric acid, the\r\nother in the solution, and thus produced a circuit between the tube and\r\njar, and as these plates had been connected by a bit of wire, the one\r\nin the tube became the positive and the other the negative pole of the\r\napparatus. Each jar produced its currents, which, together, were\r\nsufficient to cause all the phenomena of the electric telegraph.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of February they began to erect the poles, furnished with\r\nglass insulators, and some days later the wire was stretched, ready to\r\nproduce the electric current, which travels with the speed of 100,000\r\nkilometres a second.\r\n\r\nTwo batteries had been made, one for Granite House, and the other for\r\nthe corral, as, if the corral had to communicate with Granite House, it\r\nmight, also, be needful for Granite House to communicate with the\r\ncorral.\r\n\r\nAs to the indicator and manipulator, they were very simple. At both\r\nstations the wire was wrapped around an electro-magnet of soft iron.\r\nCommunication was established between the two poles; the current,\r\nleaving the positive pole, traversed the wire, passed into the\r\nelectro-magnet, and returned under ground to the negative pole. The\r\ncurrent closed, the attraction of the electro-magnet ceased. It was,\r\ntherefore, sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the\r\nelectro-magnet which, attracted while the current is passing, falls,\r\nwhen it is interrupted. The movement of the plate thus obtained, Smith\r\neasily fastened to it a needle, pointing to a dial, which bore the\r\nletters of the alphabet upon its face.\r\n\r\nEverything was finished by the 12th of February. On that day Smith,\r\nhaving turned on the current, asked if everything was all right at the\r\ncorral, and received, in a few moments, a satisfactory reply from\r\nAyrton.\r\n\r\nPencroff was beside himself with delight, and every morning and evening\r\nhe sent a telegraph to the corral, which never remained unanswered.\r\n\r\nThis method of communication presented evident advantages, both in\r\ninforming the colonists of Ayrton’s presence at the corral, and in\r\npreventing his complete isolation. Moreover, Smith never allowed a week\r\nto pass without visiting him, and Ayrton came occasionally to Granite\r\nHouse, where he always found a kind reception.\r\n\r\nContinuing their accustomed work, the fine weather passed away, and the\r\nresources of the colony, particularly in vegetables and cereals,\r\nincreased from day to day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island had\r\nbeen perfectly acclimated. The plateau presented a most attractive\r\nappearance. The fourth crop of corn had been excellent, and no one\r\nundertook to count the 400,000,000,000 grains produced in the harvest;\r\nalthough Pencroff had had some such idea, until Smith informed him\r\nthat, supposing he could count 300 grains a minute, or 18,000 an hour,\r\nit would take him 5,500 years to accomplish his undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe weather was superb, though somewhat warm during the day; but, in\r\nthe evening, the sea-breeze sprung up, tempering the air and giving\r\nrefreshing nights to the inhabitants of Granite House. Still there were\r\nsome storms, which, although not long continued, fell upon Lincoln\r\nIsland with extraordinary violence. For several hours at a time the\r\nlightning never ceased illuminating the heavens, and the thunder roared\r\nwithout cessation.\r\n\r\nThis was a season of great prosperity to the little colony. The\r\ndenizens of the poultry-yard increased rapidly, and the colonists lived\r\non this increase, as it was necessary to keep the population within\r\ncertain limits. The pigs had littered, and Pencroff and Neb’s attention\r\nto these animals absorbed a great part of their time. There were too\r\nyoung onagers, and their parents were often ridden by Spilett and\r\nHerbert, or hitched to the cart to drag wood or bring the minerals\r\nwhich the engineer made use of.\r\n\r\nMany explorations were made about this time into the depths of the Far\r\nWest. The explorers did not suffer from the heat, as the sun’s rays\r\ncould not penetrate the leafy roof above them. Thus, they visited all\r\nthat part to the left of the Mercy, bordering on the route from the\r\ncorral to the mouth of Fall River.\r\n\r\nBut during these excursions the colonists took care to be well armed,\r\nas they often encountered exceedingly savage and ferocious wild boars.\r\nThey also waged war against the jaguars, for which animals Spilett had\r\na special hatred, and his pupil, Herbert, seconded him well. Armed as\r\nthey were, the hunters never shunned an encounter with these beasts,\r\nand the courage of Herbert was superb, while the coolness of the\r\nreporter was astonishing. Twenty magnificent skins already ornamented\r\nthe hall at Granite House, and at this rate the jaguars would soon be\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\nSometimes the engineer took part in explorations of the unknown\r\nportions of the island, which he observed with minute attention. There\r\nwere other traces than those of animals which he sought for in the\r\nthickest places in the forests, but not once did anything suspicions\r\nappear. Top and Jup, who accompanied him, showed by their action that\r\nthere was nothing there, and yet the dog had growled more than once\r\nagain above that pit which the engineer had explored without result.\r\n\r\nDuring this season Spilett, assisted by Herbert, took numerous views of\r\nthe most picturesque portions of the island, by means of the\r\nphotographic apparatus, which had not been used until now.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, furnished with a powerful lens, was very complete. All\r\nthe substances necessary in photographic work were there; the nitrate\r\nof silver, the hyposulphata of soda, the chloride of ammonium, the\r\nacetate of soda, and the chloride of gold. Even the paper was there,\r\nall prepared, so that all that was necessary, in order to use it, was\r\nto steep it for a few moments in diluted nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\nThe reporter and his assistant soon became expert operators, and they\r\nobtained fine views of the neighborhood, such as a comprehensive view\r\nof the island taken from Prospect Plateau, with Mount Franklin on the\r\nhorizon, the mouth of the Mercy so picturesquely framed between its\r\nhigh rocks, the glade and the corral, with the lower spurs of the\r\nmountain in the background, the curious outline of Claw Cape, Jetsam\r\nPoint, etc. Neither did the photographers forget to take portraits of\r\nall the inhabitants of the island, without exception.\r\n\r\n“Its people,” as Pencroff expressed it.\r\n\r\nAnd the sailor was charmed to see his likeness, faithfully reproduced,\r\nornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stood before this\r\ndisplay as pleased as if he had been gazing in one of the richest\r\nshow-windows on Broadway.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, however, that the portrait, showing the finest\r\nexecution, was that of master Jup. Master Jup has posed with a gravity\r\nimpossible to describe, and his picture was a speaking likeness!\r\n\r\n“One would say he was laughing!” exclaimed Pencroff.\r\n\r\nAnd if Jup had not been satisfied, he must have been hard to please.\r\nBut there it was, and he contemplated his image with such a sentimental\r\nair, that it was evident he was a little conceited.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the summer ended with March. The season was rainy, but the\r\nair was still warm, and the month was not as pleasant as they had\r\nexpected. Perhaps it foreboded an early and a rigorous winter.\r\n\r\nOne morning, the 21st, Herbert had risen early, and, looking from the\r\nwindow, exclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“Hullo, the islet is covered with snow!”\r\n\r\n“Snow at this season!” cried the reporter, joining the lad.\r\n\r\nTheir companions were soon beside them, and every one saw that not only\r\nthe islet, but that the entire beach below Granite House, was covered\r\nwith the white mantle.\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed, snow,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Or something very much like it,” replied Neb.\r\n\r\n“But the thermometer stands at 58°,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\nSmith looked at the white covering without speaking, for he was,\r\nindeed, at a loss how to explain such a phenomenon in this season and\r\nin this temperature.\r\n\r\n“The deuce!” cried the sailor; “our crops will have been frost-bitten.”\r\n\r\nAnd he was about descending when Jup sprang before him and slid down\r\nthe rope to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe orang had scarcely touched the earth before the immense body of\r\nsnow rose and scattered itself through the air in such innumerable\r\nflocks as to darken all the heavens for a time.\r\n\r\n“They are birds!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\nThe effect had, indeed, been produced by myriads of sea-birds, with\r\nplumage of brilliant whiteness. They had come from hundreds of miles\r\naround on to the islet and the coast, and they now disappeared in the\r\nhorizon, leaving the colonists as amazed as if they had witnessed a\r\ntransformation scene, from winter to summer, in some fancy spectacle.\r\nUnfortunately, the change had been so sudden that neither the reporter\r\nnor the lad had had an opportunity of knocking over some of these\r\nbirds, whose species they did not recognize.\r\n\r\nA few days later, and it was the 26th of March. Two years had passed\r\nsince the balloon had been thrown upon Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS OF HOME—CHANCES OF RETURN —PLAN TO EXPLORE THE COAST—THE\r\nDEPARTURE OF THE 16TH OF APRIL—SERPENTINE PENINSULA SEEN FROM SEA—THE\r\nBASALTIC CLIFFS OF THE WESTERN COAST—BAD WEATHER—NIGHT—A NEW INCIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years already! For two years the colonists had had no communication\r\nwith their fellows! They knew no more of what was happening in the\r\nworld, lost upon this island, than if they had been upon the most\r\ndistant asteroid of the solar system.\r\n\r\nWhat was going on in their country? Their fatherland was always present\r\nto their eyes, that land which, when they left it, was torn by civil\r\nstrife, which perhaps was still red with rebellious blood. It was a\r\ngreat grief to them, this war, and they often talked about it, never\r\ndoubting, however, that the cause of the North would triumph for the\r\nhonor of the American confederation.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years not a ship had been seen. It was evident that\r\nLincoln Island was out of the route of vessels; that it was unknown—the\r\nmaps proved this—was evident, because, although it had no harbor, yet\r\nits streams would have drawn thither vessels desiring to renew their\r\nsupply of water. But the surrounding sea was always desert, and the\r\ncolonists could count on no outside help to bring them to their home.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, one chance of rescue existed, which was discussed one day\r\nin the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered in the\r\nhall of Granite House.\r\n\r\nThey had been talking of America and of the small hope of ever seeing\r\nit again.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, there is but one way of leaving the island,” said\r\nSpilett, “which is, to build a vessel large enough to make a voyage of\r\nsome hundreds of miles. It seems to me, that, when one can build a\r\nshallop, they can readily build a ship.”\r\n\r\n“And that they can as easily go to the Low Archipelago as to Tabor\r\nIsland,” added Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I do not say we cannot,” replied Pencroff, who always had the most to\r\nsay on questions of a maritime nature; “I do not say we cannot,\r\nalthough it is very different whether one goes far or near! If our\r\nsloop had been threatened with bad weather when we went to Tabor\r\nIsland, we knew that a shelter was not far off in either direction; but\r\n1,200 miles to travel is a long bit of road, and the nearest land is at\r\nleast that distance!”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean, supposing the case to occur, Pencroff, that you would not\r\nrisk it?” questioned the reporter.\r\n\r\n“I would undertake whatever you wished, sir,” replied the sailor, “and\r\nyou know I am not the man to draw back.”\r\n\r\n“Remember, moreover, that we have another sailor with us, now,” said\r\nNeb.\r\n\r\n“Who do you mean,” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” responded Herbert.\r\n\r\n“If he would join us,” remarked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the reporter, “do you think that if Lord Glenarvan’s yacht\r\nhad arrived at Tabor Island while Ayrton was living there, that he\r\nwould have refused to leave?”\r\n\r\n“You forget, my friends,” said Smith, “that Ayrton was not himself\r\nduring the last few years there. But that is not the question. It is\r\nimportant to know whether we can count on the return of this Scotch\r\nvessel as among our chances for rescue. Now, Lord Glenarvan promised\r\nAyrton that he would return to Tabor Island, when he judged his crimes\r\nsufficiently punished, and I believe that he will return.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the reporter, “and, moreover, I think he will return soon,\r\nas already Ayrton has been here twelve years!”\r\n\r\n“I, also, think this lord will come back, and, probably, very soon. But\r\nwhere will he come to? Not here, but to Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“That is as sure as that Lincoln Island is not on the maps,” said\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, my friends,” replied Smith, “we must take the necessary\r\nprecautions to have Ayrton’s and our presence on Lincoln Island\r\nadvertised on Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“Evidently,” said the reporter, “and nothing can be easier than to\r\nplace in Captain Grant’s cabin a notice, giving the situation of our\r\nisland.”\r\n\r\n“It is, nevertheless, annoying,” rejoined the sailor, “that we forgot\r\nto do that on our first voyage to the place.”\r\n\r\n“Why should we have done so?” replied Herbert. “We knew nothing about\r\nAyrton at that time, and when we learned his history, the season was\r\ntoo far advanced to allow of our going back there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Smith, “it was too late then, and we had to postpone\r\nthe voyage until spring.”\r\n\r\n“But supposing the yacht comes in the meantime?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“It is not likely,” replied the engineer, “as Lord Glenarvan would not\r\nchoose the winter season to adventure into these distant seas. Either\r\nit has already been to the island, in the five months that Ayrton has\r\nbeen with us, or it will come later, and it will be time enough, in the\r\nfirst fine weather of October, to go to Tabor Island and leave a notice\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“It would, indeed, be unfortunate,” said Neb, “if the Duncan has been\r\nto and left these seas within a few months.”\r\n\r\n“I hope that it is not so,” answered Smith, “and that Heaven has not\r\ndeprived us of this last remaining chance.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” observed the reporter, “that, at least, we will know what\r\nour chances are, when we have visited the island; for those Stockmen\r\nwould, necessarily, leave some trace of their visit, had they been\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” answered the engineer. “And, my friends, since we have\r\nthis chance of rescue, let us wait patiently, and if we find it has\r\nbeen taken from us, we will see then what to do.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Pencroff, “it is agreed that if we do leave the\r\ninland by some way or another, it will not be on account of\r\nill-treatment!”\r\n\r\n“No indeed, Pencroff,” replied the reporter, “it will be because we are\r\nfar from everything which a man loves in this world, his family, his\r\nfriends, his country!”\r\n\r\nEverything having been thus arranged there was no longer any question\r\nof building a ship, and the colonists occupied themselves in preparing\r\nfor their third winter in Granite House.\r\n\r\nBut they determined, before the bad weather set in, to make a voyage in\r\nthe sloop around the island. The exploration of the coast had never\r\nbeen completed, and the colonists had only an imperfect idea of its\r\nwestern and northern portions from the mouth of Fall River to the\r\nMandible Capes, and of the narrow bay between them.\r\n\r\nPencroff had proposed this excursion, and Smith had gladly agreed to\r\nit, as he wished to see for himself all that part of his domain.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still unsettled, but the barometer made no rapid\r\nchanges, and they might expect fair days. So, in the first week of\r\nApril, after a very low barometer, its rise was followed by a strong\r\nwest wind, which lasted for five or six weeks; then the needle of the\r\ninstrument became stationary at a high figure, and everything seemed\r\npropitious for the exploration.\r\n\r\nThe day of departure was set for the 16th, and the Good Luck, moored in\r\nBalloon Harbor, was provisioned for a long cruise.\r\n\r\nSmith told Ayrton of the excursion, and proposed to him to take part in\r\nit; but as Ayrton preferred to remain on shore, it was decided that he\r\nshould come to Granite House while his companions were absent. Jup was\r\nleft to keep him company, and made no objection.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th all the colonists, including Top, went on\r\nboard the Good Luck. The breeze blew fresh from the south-west, so that\r\nfrom Balloon Harbor they had to beat up against the wind in order to\r\nmake Reptile End. The distance between these two points, following the\r\ncoast, was twenty miles. As the wind was dead ahead, and they had had\r\non starting but two hours of the ebb, it took all day to reach the\r\npromontory, and it was night before the point was doubled.\r\n\r\nPencroff proposed to the engineer that they should keep on slowly,\r\nsailing under a double-reef, but Smith preferred mooring some cable\r\nlengths from shore, in order to survey this part of the coast by\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nAnd it was agreed that henceforth, as a minute exploration of the\r\nisland was to be made, they would not sail at night, but cast anchor\r\nevery evening at the most available point.\r\n\r\nThe wind fell as night approached, and the silence was unbroken. The\r\nlittle party, excepting Pencroff, slept less comfortably than in their\r\nbeds at Granite House, but still they slept; and at daylight the next\r\nmorning the sailor raised anchor, and, with a free wind, skirted the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThe colonists knew this magnificently wooded border, as they had\r\ntraversed it formerly, on foot; but its appearance excited renewed\r\nadmiration. They ran as close in as possible, and moderated their speed\r\nin order to observe it carefully. Often, they would cast anchor that\r\nSpilett might take photographic views of the superb scenery.\r\n\r\nAbout noon the Good Luck arrived at the mouth of the Fall River. Above,\r\nupon the right bank, the trees were less numerous, and three miles\r\nfurther on they grew in mere isolated groups between the western spurs\r\nof the mountain, whose arid declivities extended to the very edge of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nHow great was the contrast between the southern and the northern\r\nportions of this coast! The one wooded and verdant, the other harsh and\r\nsavage! It was what they call in certain countries, an “iron-bound\r\ncoast,” and its tempestuous aspect seemed to indicate a sudden\r\ncrystallization of the boiling basalt in the geologic epochs. How\r\nappalling would this hideous mass have been to the colonists if they\r\nhad chanced to have been thrown on this part of the island! When they\r\nwere on Mount Franklin, their position had been too elevated for them\r\nto recognize the awfully forbidding aspect of this shore; but, viewed\r\nfrom the sea, it presented an appearance, the like of which cannot be\r\nseen, perhaps, in any portion of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe sloop passed for half a mile before this coast. It was composed of\r\nblocks of all dimensions from twenty to thirty feet high, and of all\r\nsorts of shapes, towers, steeples, pyramids, obelisks, and cones. The\r\nice-bergs of the polar seas could not have been thrown together in more\r\nfrightful confusion! Here, the rocks formed bridges, there, nave-like\r\narches, of indistinguishable depth; in one place, were excavations\r\nresembling monumental vaults, in another a crowd of points outnumbering\r\nthe pinnacles of a Gothic cathedral. All the caprices of nature, more\r\nvaried than those of the imagination, were here displayed over a\r\ndistance of eight or nine miles.\r\n\r\nSmith and companions gazed with a surprise approaching stupefaction.\r\nBut, though they rested mute, Top kept up an incessant barking, which\r\nawoke a thousand echoes. The engineer noticed the same strangeness in\r\nthe dog’s action as he showed at the month of the well in Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n“Go alongside,” said Smith.\r\n\r\nAnd the Good Luck ran in as close to the rocks as possible. Perhaps\r\nthere was some cavern here which it would be well to explore. But Smith\r\nsaw nothing, not even a hollow which could serve as a retreat for any\r\nliving thing, and the base of the rocks was washed by the surf of the\r\nsea. After a time the dog stopped barking, and the sloop kept off again\r\nat some cable lengths from the shore.\r\n\r\nIn the northwest portion of the island the shore became flat and sandy.\r\nA few trees rose above the low and swampy ground, the home of myriads\r\nof aquatic birds.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the sloop moored in a slight hollow of the shore, to the\r\nnorth of the island. She was close into the bank, as the water here was\r\nof great depth. The breeze died away with nightfall, and the night\r\npassed without incident.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Spilett and Herbert went ashore for a couple of hours\r\nand brought back many bunches of ducks and snipe, and by 8 o’clock the\r\nGood Luck, with a fair, freshening breeze, was speeding on her way to\r\nNorth Mandible Cape.\r\n\r\n“I should not be surprised,” said Pencroff, “if we had a squall.\r\nYesterday the sun set red, and, this morning, the cats-tails foreboded\r\nno good.”\r\n\r\nThese “cats-tails”—were slender cyrrhi, scattered high above, in the\r\nzenith. These feathery messengers usually announce the near disturbance\r\nof the elements.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then,” said Smith, “crowd on all sail and make for Shark\r\nGulf. There, I think the sloop will be safe.”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” replied the sailor, “and, moreover, the north coast is\r\nnothing but uninteresting downs.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not regret,” added the engineer, “passing, not only the night,\r\nbut also tomorrow in that bay, which deserves to be explored with\r\ncare.”\r\n\r\n“I guess we’ll have to, whether we want to or no,” replied Pencroff,\r\n“as it is beginning to be threatening in the west. See how dirty it\r\nlooks!”\r\n\r\n“Any how, we have a good wind to make Mandible Cape,” observed the\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\n“First rate; but, we will have to tack to get into the gulf, and I\r\nwould rather have clear weather in those parts which I know nothing\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“Parts which are sown with reefs,” added Herbert, “if I may judge from\r\nwhat we have seen of the coast to the south of the gulf.”\r\n\r\n“Pencroff,” said Smith, “do whatever you think best, we leave\r\neverything to you.”\r\n\r\n“Rest assured, sir,” responded the sailor, “I will not run any\r\nunnecessary risk. I would rather have a knife in my vitals, than that\r\nmy Good Luck should run on a rock!”\r\n\r\n“What time is it?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“10 o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“And how far is it to the cape?”\r\n\r\n“About fifteen miles.”\r\n\r\n“That will take two hours and a half. Unfortunately, the tide then will\r\nbe going down, and it will be a hard matter to enter the gulf with wind\r\nand tide against us.”\r\n\r\n“Moreover,” said Herbert, “it is full moon to-day, and these April\r\ntides are very strong.”\r\n\r\n“But, Pencroff,” asked Smith, “cannot you anchor at the cape?”\r\n\r\n“Anchor close to land, with bad weather coming on!” cried the sailor.\r\n“That would be to run ourselves ashore.”\r\n\r\n“Then what will you do?”\r\n\r\n“Keep off, if possible, until the tide turns, which will be about 1\r\no’clock, and if there is any daylight left try to enter the gulf; if\r\nnot, we will beat on and off until daylight.”\r\n\r\n“I have said, Pencroff, that we will leave everything to your\r\njudgment.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Pencroff, “if only there was a light-house on this coast it\r\nwould be easier for sailors.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Herbert, “and this time we have no thoughtful engineer\r\nto light a fire to guide us into harbor.”\r\n\r\n“By the way, Cyrus,” said Spilett, “we have never thanked you for that;\r\nbut indeed, without that fire we would not have reached—”\r\n\r\n“A fire?” demanded Smith, astounded by the words of the reporter.\r\n\r\n“We wish to say, sir,” said Pencroff, “that we would have been in a bad\r\nfix on board the Good Luck, when we were nearly back, and that we would\r\nhave passed to windward of the island unless you had taken the\r\nprecaution to light a fire, on the night of the 19th of October, upon\r\nthe plateau above Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes! It was a happy thought!” replied Smith.\r\n\r\n“And now,” added Pencroff, “unless Ayrton thinks of it, there is not a\r\nsoul to do us this little service.”\r\n\r\n“No—no one!” replied Smith.\r\n\r\nAnd a moment or two later, being alone with Spilett, the engineer\r\nwhispered to him:—\r\n\r\n“If there is anything sure in this world, Spilett, it is that I never\r\nlit a fire on that night, either on the plateau or anywhere else!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT AT SEA—SHARK GULF—CONFIDENCES—PREPARATIONS FOR WINTER—EARLY\r\nADVENT OF BAD WEATHER—COLD—IN-DOOR WORK—SIX MONTHS LATER—A SPECK ON THE\r\nPHOTOGRAPH—AN UNEXPECTED EVENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sailor’s predictions were well founded. The breeze changed to a\r\nstrong blow such as would hare caused a ship in the open sea to have\r\nlowered her topmasts and sailed under close reefs. The sloop was\r\nopposite the gulf at 6 o’clock, but the tide was running out, so all\r\nthat Pencroff could do was to bend the jib down to the mainmast as a\r\nstay-sail and lie to with the bows of the Good Luck pointing on shore.\r\n\r\nFortunately, although the wind was strong, the ocean, protected by the\r\ncoast, was not very rough, and there was no danger from heavy seas,\r\nwhich would have tried the staunchness of the little craft. Pencroff,\r\nalthough he had every confidence in his boat, waited anxiously for\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nDuring the night Smith and Spilett had not another opportunity to talk\r\nalone, although the whispered words of the engineer made the reporter\r\nanxious to discuss with him again the mysterious influence which seemed\r\nto pervade Lincoln Island. Spilett could not rid himself of the thought\r\nof this new and inexplicable incident. He and his companions also had\r\ncertainly seen this light, and yet Smith declared that he knew nothing\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nHe determined to return to this subject as soon as they returned home,\r\nand to urge Smith to inform their companions of these strange events.\r\nPerhaps, then, they would decide to make, altogether, a thorough search\r\ninto every part of the island.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was, no light appeared upon these unknown shores during\r\nthis night, and at daylight the wind, which had moderated somewhat,\r\nshifted a couple of points, and permitted Pencroff to enter the gulf\r\nwithout difficulty. About 7 o’clock the Good Luck passed into these\r\nwaters enclosed in a grotesque frame of lava.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said Pencroff, “is a fine roadstead, where fleets could ride at\r\nease.”\r\n\r\n“It is curious,” remarked Smith, “that this gulf has been formed by two\r\nsuccessive streams of lava, completely enclosing its waters; and it is\r\nprobable that, in the worst weather, the sea here is perfectly calm.”\r\n\r\n“It is a little too large for the Good Luck,” remarked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“I admit that,” replied the sailor, “but if the navy of the United\r\nStates needed a shelter in the Pacific, I don’t think they could find a\r\nbetter roadstead than this!”\r\n\r\n“We are in the shark’s jaws,” said Neb, alluding to the form of the\r\ngulf.\r\n\r\n“We are, indeed,” replied Herbert; “but, Neb, you are not afraid that\r\nthey will close on us?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, not that; and yet I don’t like the looks of the place. It has\r\na wicked aspect.”\r\n\r\n“So Neb begins running down my roadstead just as I was thinking to\r\noffer it to the United States!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“But are its waters deep enough?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“That is easily seen,” answered the sailor, taking the sounding line,\r\nwhich measured fifty fathoms, and letting it down. It unrolled to the\r\nend without touching bottom.\r\n\r\n“There,” said Pencroff, “our iron-clads could come here without running\r\naground!”\r\n\r\n“In truth,” said Smith, “this gulf is an abyss; but when we remember\r\nthe plutonic origin of the island, that is not extraordinary.”\r\n\r\n“One might think,” said Herbert, “that these walls had been cut with an\r\ninstrument, and I believe that at their very base, even with a line six\r\ntimes as long, we could not reach the bottom.”\r\n\r\n“All this is very well,” said the reporter, “but I would suggest that\r\nPencroff’s roadstead lacks one important element.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“A cut, or pathway of some kind, by which one could go inland. I do not\r\nsee a place where there is even a foothold.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, these steep lava walls afforded no landing place on all\r\ntheir circumference. The Good Luck, skirting within touching distance\r\nof the lava, found no place where the passengers could disembark.\r\n\r\nPencroff consoled himself by saying that they could blow up the wall,\r\nif they wanted to, and then, as there was certainly nothing to be done\r\nhere, he turned towards the narrow opening, which was passed at 2\r\no’clock.\r\n\r\nNeb gave a long sigh of relief. It was evident that the brave negro had\r\nnot been comfortable in those enormous jaws!\r\n\r\nThe sloop was now headed for Granite House, eight miles distant, and,\r\nwith a fair wind, coasted along within a mile of the shore. The\r\nenormous lava rocks were soon succeeded by the oddly-disposed downs,\r\namong which the engineer had been so singularly discovered, and the\r\nplace was covered with sea-birds.\r\n\r\nTowards 4 o’clock, Pencroff, leaving the islet to the left, entered the\r\nchannel separating it from the island, and an hour later cast anchor in\r\nthe Mercy.\r\n\r\nThe colonists had been absent three days. Ayrton was waiting for them\r\non the shore, and Jup came joyously to welcome them, grinning with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe entire exploration of the coast had been made, and nothing\r\nsuspicious had been seen. So that if any mysterious being resided on\r\nthe island, it must be under cover of the impenetrable woods on\r\nSerpentine Peninsula, which the colonists had not, as yet,\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nSpilett talked the matter over with the engineer, and it was agreed\r\nthat they should call their comrades’ attention to these strange\r\nevents, the last one of which was the most inexplicable of all.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you saw it, Spilett?” asked Smith, for the twentieth\r\ntime. “Was it not a partial eruption of the volcano, or some meteor?”\r\n\r\n“No, Cyrus, it wag certainly a fire lit by the hand of man. For that\r\nmatter, question Pencroff and Herbert. They saw it also, and they will\r\nconfirm my words.”\r\n\r\nSo, some evenings later, on the 26th of April, when all the colonists\r\nwere gathered together on Prospect Plateau, Smith began:—\r\n\r\n“My friends, I want to call your attention to certain things which are\r\nhappening in our island, and to a subject on which I am anxious to have\r\nyour advice. These things are almost supernatural—”\r\n\r\n“Supernatural!” exclaimed the sailor, puffing his pipe. “Can anything\r\nbe supernatural?”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff, but certainly mysterious; unless, indeed, you can\r\nexplain what Spilett and I have been unable to account for up to this\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hear it, Mr. Smith,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Very well. Have you understood, then, how, after being thrown into the\r\nsea, I was found a quarter of a mile inland, without my having been\r\nconscious of getting there?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, having fainted,”—began the sailor.\r\n\r\n“That is not admissible,” answered the engineer; “but, letting that go,\r\nhave you understood how Top discovered your retreat five miles from the\r\nplace where I lay?”\r\n\r\n“The dog’s instinct,” replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n“A singular instinct,” remarked the reporter, “since, in spite of the\r\nstorm that was raging, Top arrived at the Chimneys dry and clean!”\r\n\r\n“Let that pass,” continued the engineer; “have you understood how our\r\ndog was so strangely thrown up from the lake, after his struggle with\r\nthe dugong?”\r\n\r\n“No! that I avow,” replied Pencroff, “and the wound in the dugong which\r\nseemed to have been made by some sharp instrument, I don’t understand\r\nthat at all.”\r\n\r\n“Let us pass on again,” replied Smith. “Have you understood, my\r\nfriends, how that leaden bullet was in the body of the peccary; how\r\nthat box was so fortunately thrown ashore, without any trace of a\r\nshipwreck; how that bottle, enclosing the paper, was found so\r\nopportunely; how our canoe, having broken its rope, floated down the\r\nMercy to us at the very moment when we needed it; how, after the\r\ninvasion of the monkeys, the ladder was let down from Granite House;\r\nhow, finally, the document, which Ayrton pretends not to have written,\r\ncame into our hands?”\r\n\r\nSmith had thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the strange events\r\nthat had happened on the island. Herbert, Pencroff, and Neb looked at\r\neach other, not knowing what to say, as this succession of events, thus\r\ngrouped together, gave them the greatest surprise.\r\n\r\n“Upon my faith,” said Pencroff, at length, “you are right, Mr. Smith,\r\nand it is hard to explain those things.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, my friends,” continued the engineer, “one thing more is to\r\nbe added, not less incomprehensible than the others!”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” demanded Herbert, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“When you returned from Tabor Island, Pencroff, you say that you saw a\r\nlight on Lincoln Island?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I did.”\r\n\r\n“And you are perfectly sure that you saw it?”\r\n\r\n“As sure as that I see you.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Herbert?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Smith,” cried Herbert, “it shone like a star of the first\r\nmagnitude!”\r\n\r\n“But was it not a star?” insisted the engineer.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Pencroff, “because the sky was covered with heavy clouds,\r\nand, under any circumstances, a star would not have been so low on the\r\nhorizon. But Mr. Spilett saw it, and he can confirm what we say.”\r\n\r\n“I would add,” said the reporter, “that it was as bright as an electric\r\nlight.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and it was certainly placed above Granite House!” exclaimed\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“Very well, my friends,” replied Smith, “during all that night neither\r\nNeb nor I lit any fire at all!”\r\n\r\n“You did not!—” cried Pencroff, so overcome with astonishment that he\r\ncould not finish the sentence.\r\n\r\n“We did not leave Granite House, and if any fire appeared upon the\r\ncoast, it was lit by another hand!”\r\n\r\nThe others were stupefied with amazement. Undoubtedly a mystery\r\nexisted! Some inexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the\r\ncolonists, but exciting their curiosity, made itself felt upon Lincoln\r\nIsland. Was there then some being hidden in its innermost retreats?\r\nThey wished to know this, cost what it might!\r\n\r\nSmith also recalled to his companions the singular actions of Top and\r\nJup, about the mouth of the well, and he told them that he had explored\r\nits depths without discovering anything. And the conversation ended by\r\na determination, on the part of the colonists, to make a thorough\r\nsearch of the island as soon as the spring opened.\r\n\r\nAfter this Pencroff became moody. This island, which he had looked upon\r\nas his own, did not belong to him alone, but was shared by another, to\r\nwhom, whether he would or not, the sailor felt himself inferior. Neb\r\nand he often discussed these inexplicable circumstances, and readily\r\nconcluded that Lincoln Island was subject to some supernatural\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe bad weather began early, coming in with May; and the winter\r\noccupations were undertaken without delay. The colonists were well\r\nprotected from the rigor of the season. They had plenty of felt\r\nclothing, and the moufflons had furnished a quantity of wool for its\r\nfurther manufacture.\r\n\r\nAyrton had been comfortably clothed, and when the bad weather began, he\r\nhad returned to Granite House; but he remained humble and sad, never\r\njoining in the amusements of his companions.\r\n\r\nThe most of this third winter was passed by the colonists indoors at\r\nGranite House. The storms were frequent and terrible, the sea broke\r\nover the islet, and any ship driven upon the coast would have been lost\r\nwithout any chance of rescue. Twice the Mercy rose to such a height\r\nthat the bridge and causeways were in danger of destruction. Often the\r\ngusts of wind, mingled with snow and rain, damaged the fields and the\r\npoultry-yard, and made constant repairs necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this season, some jaguars and quadrumanes came to the\r\nvery border of the plateau, and there was danger of the bolder of these\r\nbeasts making a descent on the fields and domestic animals of the\r\ncolonists. So that a constant watch had to be kept upon these dangerous\r\nvisitors, and this, together with the work indoors, kept the little\r\nparty in Granite House busy.\r\n\r\nThus the winter passed, with now and then a grand hunt in the frozen\r\nmarshes of Tadorn’s Fen. The damage done to the corral during the\r\nwinter was unimportant, and was soon repaired by Ayrton, who, in the\r\nlatter part of October, returned there to spend some days at work.\r\n\r\nThe winter had passed without any new incident. Top and Jup passed by\r\nthe well without giving any sign of anxiety, and it seemed as if the\r\nseries of supernatural events had been interrupted. Nevertheless, the\r\ncolonists were fixed in their determination to make a thorough\r\nexploration of the most inaccessible parts of the island, when an event\r\nof the gravest moment, which set aside all the plans of Smith and his\r\ncompanions, happened.\r\n\r\nIt was the 28th of October. Spring was rapidly approaching, and the\r\nyoung leaves were appearing on the trees on the edge of the forest.\r\nHerbert, tempted by the beauty of the day, determined to take a\r\nphotograph of Union Bay, as it lay facing Prospect Plateau, between\r\nMandible and Claw Capes.\r\n\r\nIt was 3 o’clock, the horizon was perfectly clear, and the sea, just\r\nstirred by the breeze, scintillated with light. The instrument had been\r\nplaced at one of the windows of Granite House, and the lad, having\r\nsecured his negative, took the glass into the dark room, where the\r\nchemicals were kept, in order to fix it. Returning to the light, after\r\nthis operation, he saw a speck on the plate, just at the horizon, which\r\nhe was unable to wash out.\r\n\r\n“It is a defect in the glass,” he thought.\r\n\r\nAnd then he was seized by a curiosity to examine this speck by means of\r\na magnifying glass made from one of the lenses of the instrument.\r\n\r\nHardly had he given one look, when, uttering a cry of amazement, he ran\r\nwith the plate and the glass to Smith. The latter examined the speck,\r\nand immediately seizing the spy-glass hurried to the window.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, sweeping the horizon with the glass, found the speck, and\r\nspoke one word. “A ship!”\r\n\r\nIn truth, a ship was in sight of Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\nTHE SECRET OF THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOST OR SAVED?—AYRTON RECALLED—IMPORTANT DISCUSSION—IT IS NOT THE\r\nDUNCAN—SUSPICION AND PRECAUTION—APPROACH OF THE SHIP—A CANNON SHOT—THE\r\nBRIG ANCHORS IN SIGHT OF THE ISLAND—NIGHT FALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years and a half ago, the castaways had been thrown on Lincoln\r\nIsland; and up to this time they had been cut off from their kind. Once\r\nthe reporter had attempted to establish communication with the\r\ncivilized world, by a letter tied to the neck of a bird; but this was\r\nan expedient on whose success they could place no reliance. Ayrton,\r\nindeed, under the circumstances which have been related, had joined the\r\nlittle colony. And now, on the 17th of October, other men had appeared\r\nwithin sight of the island, on that desert sea! There could be no doubt\r\nof it; there was a ship, but would she sail away into the offing, or\r\nput in shore? The question would soon be decided. Smith and Herbert\r\nhastened to call the others into the great hall of Granite House, and\r\ninform them of what had been observed. Pencroff seized the spy-glass\r\nand swept the horizon till his gaze fell upon the point indicated.\r\n\r\n“No doubt of it, she’s a ship!” said he in a tone of no great pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Is she coming towards us?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Impossible to say yet,” replied Pencroff, “for only her sails are\r\nvisible; her hull is below the horizon.\r\n\r\n“What must we do?” said the boy.\r\n\r\n“We must wait,” said Smith.\r\n\r\nAnd for a time which seemed interminable, the colonists remained in\r\nsilence, moved alternately by fear and hope. They were not in the\r\nsituation of castaways upon a desert island, constantly struggling with\r\nniggardly Nature for the barest means of living, and always longing to\r\ngot back to their fellow-men. Pencroff and Neb, especially, would have\r\nquitted the island with great regret. They were made, in truth, for the\r\nnew life which they were living in a region civilized by their own\r\nexertions! Still, this ship would bring them news of the Continent;\r\nperhaps it was an American vessel; assuredly it carried men of their\r\nown race, and their hearts beat high at the thought!\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, Pencroff went to the window with the glass. From\r\nthence he examined the ship carefully. She was still twenty miles to\r\nthe east, and they had no means of communication with her. Neither flag\r\nnor fire would have been seen; nor would the report of a gun be heard.\r\nYet the island, with Mount Franklin towering high above it, must be\r\nvisible to the lookout men on the ship. But why should the vessel land\r\nthere? Was it not mere chance which brought it into that part of the\r\nPacific, out of the usual track, and when Tabor Island was the only\r\nland indicated on the maps? But here a suggestion came from Herbert.\r\n\r\n“May it not be the Duncan?” cried he.\r\n\r\nThe Duncan, as our readers will remember, was Lord Glenarvan’s yacht,\r\nwhich had abandoned Ayrton on the islet, and was one day to come back\r\nfor him. Now the islet was not so far from Lincoln Island but that a\r\nship steering for one might pass within sight of the other. They were\r\nonly 150 miles distant in longitude, and 75 in latitude.\r\n\r\n“We must warn Ayrton,” said Spilett, “and tell him to come at once.\r\nOnly he can tell us whether she is the Duncan.”\r\n\r\nThis was every one’s opinion, and the reporter, going to the telegraph\r\napparatus, which communicated with the corral, telegraphed. “Come at\r\nonce.” Soon the wire clicked, “I am coming.” Then the colonists turned\r\nagain to watch the ship.\r\n\r\n“If it is the Duncan,” said Herbert, “Ayrton will readily recognize\r\nher, since he was aboard her so long.”\r\n\r\n“It will make him feel pretty queer!” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Smith, “but Ayrton is now worthy to go on board again,\r\nand may Heaven grant it to be indeed the Duncan! These are dangerous\r\nseas for Malay pirates.”\r\n\r\n“We will fight for our island,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy,” answered the engineer, smiling, “but it will be better\r\nnot to have to fight for her.”\r\n\r\n“Let me say one thing,” said Spilett. “Our island is unknown to\r\nnavigators, and it is not down in the most recent maps. Now, is not\r\nthat a good reason for a ship which unexpectedly sighted it to try to\r\nrun in shore?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the engineer, “it would even be the duty of the captain to\r\nreport the discovery of any island not on the maps, and to do this he\r\nmust pay it a visit.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pencroff, “suppose this ship casts anchor within a few\r\ncables’ length of our island, what shall we do?”\r\n\r\nThis downright question for a while remained unanswered. Then Smith,\r\nafter reflection, said in his usual calm tone:—\r\n\r\n“What we must do, my friends, is this. We will open communication with\r\nthe ship, take passage on board of her, and leave our island, after\r\nhaving taken possession of it in the name of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAfterwards we will return with a band of permanent colonists, and endow\r\nour Republic with a useful station on the Pacific!”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Pencroff, “that will be a pretty big present to our\r\ncountry! We have really colonized it already. We have named every part\r\nof the island; there is a natural port, a supply of fresh water, roads,\r\na line of telegraph, a wood yard, a foundry; we need only put the\r\nisland on the maps!”\r\n\r\n“But suppose some one else should occupy it while we are gone?” said\r\nSpilett.\r\n\r\n“I would sooner stay here alone to guard it,” cried the sailor, “and,\r\nbelieve me, they would not steal it from me, like a watch from a gaby’s\r\npocket!”\r\n\r\nFor the next hour, it was impossible to say whether or not the vessel\r\nwas making for the island. She had drawn nearer, but Pencroff could not\r\nmake out her course. Nevertheless, as the wind blew from the northeast,\r\nit seemed probable that she was on the starboard tack. Besides, the\r\nbreeze blew straight for the landing, and the sea was so calm that she\r\nwould not hesitate to steer for the island, though the soundings were\r\nnot laid down in the charts.\r\n\r\nAbout 4 o’clock, an hour after he had been telegraphed for, Ayrton\r\narrived. He entered the great hall, saying, “Here I am, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nSmith shook hands with him, and drawing him to the window, “Ayrton,”\r\nsaid he, “we sent for you for a weighty reason. A ship is within sight\r\nof the island.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Ayrton looked pale, and his eyes were troubled. Then he\r\nstooped down and gazed around the horizon.\r\n\r\n“Take this spy-glass,” said Spilett, “and look well, Ayrton, for it may\r\nbe the Duncan come to take you home.”\r\n\r\n“The Duncan!” murmured Ayrton. “Already!”\r\n\r\nThe last word escaped him involuntarily and he buried his face in his\r\nhands. Did not twelve years’ abandonment on a desert island seem to him\r\na sufficient expiation?\r\n\r\n“No,” said he, “no, it cannot be the Duncan.”\r\n\r\n“Look, Ayrton,” said the engineer, “for we must know beforehand with\r\nwhom we have to deal.”\r\n\r\nAyrton took the glass and levelled it in the direction indicated. For\r\nsome minutes he observed the horizon in silence. Then he said:—\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is a ship, but I do not think it is the Duncan.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Because the Duncan is a steam-yacht, and I see no trace of smoke about\r\nthis vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she is only under sail,” observed Pencroff. “The wind is\r\nbehind her, and she may want to save her coal, being go far from land.”\r\n\r\n“You may be right, Mr. Pencroff,” said Ayrton. “But, let her come in\r\nshore, and we shall soon know what to make of her.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he sat down in a corner and remained silent, taking no part\r\nin the noisy discussion about the unknown ship. No more work was done.\r\nSpilett and Pencroff were extremely nervous; they walked up and down,\r\nchanging place every minute. Herbert’s feeling was one of curiosity.\r\nNeb alone remained calm; his master was his country. The engineer was\r\nabsorbed in his thoughts, and was inclined to believe the ship rather\r\nan enemy than a friend. By the help of the glass they could make out\r\nthat she was a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, used by the\r\npirates of the Pacific. Pencroff, after a careful look, affirmed that\r\nthe ship was square-rigged, and was running obliquely to the coast, on\r\nthe starboard tack, under mainsail, topsail, and top-gallant sail set.\r\n\r\nJust then the ship changed her tack, and drove straight towards the\r\nisland. She was a good sailer, and rapidly neared the coast. Ayrton\r\ntook the glass to try to ascertain whether or not she was the Duncan.\r\nThe Scotch yacht, too, was square-rigged. The question therefore was\r\nwhether a smokestack could be seen between the two masts of the\r\napproaching vessel. She was now only ten miles off, and the horizon was\r\nclear. Ayrton looked for a moment, and then dropped his glass.\r\n\r\n“It is not the Duncan,” said he.\r\n\r\nPencroff sighted the brig again, and made out that she was from 300 to\r\n400 tons burden, and admirably built for sailing. To what nation she\r\nbelonged no one could tell.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” added the sailor, “there’s a flag floating at her peak, but\r\nI can’t make out her colors.”\r\n\r\n“In half an hour we will know for certain,” answered the reporter.\r\n“Besides, it is evident that their captain means to run in shore, and\r\nto-day, or to-morrow at latest, we shall make her acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“No matter, “said Pencroff, “we ought to know with whom we have to\r\ndeal, and I shall be glad to make out those colors.”\r\n\r\nAnd he kept the glass steadily at his eye. The daylight began to fail,\r\nand the sea-wind dropped with it. The brig’s flag wrapped itself around\r\nthe tackle, and could hardly be seen.\r\n\r\n“It is not the American flag,” said Pencroff, at intervals, “nor the\r\nEnglish, whose red would be very conspicuous, nor the French, nor\r\nGerman colors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow flag of\r\nSpain. It seems to be of one solid color. Let us see; what would most\r\nlikely be found in these waters? The Chilian—no, that flag is\r\ntri-colored; the Brazilian is green; the Japanese is black and yellow;\r\nwhile this—”\r\n\r\nJust then a breeze struck the flag. Ayrton took the glass and raised it\r\nto his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Black!” cried he, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\nThey had suspected the vessel with good reason. The piratical ensign\r\nwas fluttering at the peak!\r\n\r\nA dozen ideas rushed across the minds of the colonists; but there was\r\nno doubt as to the meaning of the flag. It was the ensign of the\r\nspoilers of the sea; the ensign which the Duncan would have carried, if\r\nthe convicts had succeeded in their criminal design. There was no time\r\nto be lost in discussion.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said Smith, “this vessel, perhaps, is only taking\r\nobservations of the coast of our island, and will send no boats on\r\nshore. We must do all we can to hide our presence here. The mill on\r\nProspect Plateau is too conspicuous. Let Ayrton and Neb go at once and\r\ntake down its fans. “We must cover, the windows of Granite House under\r\nthicker branches. Let the fires be put out, and nothing be left to\r\nbetray the existence of man!”\r\n\r\n“And our sloop?” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Pencroff, “she is safe in port in Balloon Harbor, and I defy\r\nthe rascals to find her there!”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s orders were instantly carried out. Neb and Ayrton went\r\nup to the plateau and concealed every trace of human habitation.\r\nMeanwhile their companions went to Jacamar Woods and brought back a\r\ngreat quantity of branches and climbing plants, which could not, from a\r\ndistance, be distinguished from a natural foliation, and would hide\r\nwell enough the windows in the rock. At the same time their arms and\r\nmunitions were piled ready at hand, in case of a sudden attack. When\r\nall these precautions had been taken Smith turned to his comrades—\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said he, in a voice full of emotion, “if these wretches\r\ntry to get possession of the island we will defend it, will we not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “and, if need be, we will die in\r\nits defense.”\r\n\r\nAnd they shook hands upon it. Ayrton alone remained seated in his\r\ncorner. Perhaps he who had been a convict himself once, still deemed\r\nhimself unworthy! Smith understood what was passing in his mind, and,\r\nstepping towards him, asked\r\n\r\n“And what will you do, Ayrton?”\r\n\r\n“My duty,” replied Ayrton. Then he went to the window, and his eager\r\ngaze sought to penetrate the foliage. It was then half-past 7 o’clock.\r\nThe sun had set behind Granite House twenty minutes before, and the\r\neastern horizon was darkening. The brig was nearing Union Bay. She was\r\nnow about eight miles away, and just abreast of Prospect Plateau, for\r\nhaving tacked off Claw Cape, she had been carried in by the rising\r\ntide. In fact she was already in the bay, for a straight line drawn\r\nfrom Claw Cape to Mandible Cape would have passed to the other side of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWas the brig going to run into the bay? And if so, would she anchor\r\nthere? Perhaps they would be satisfied with taking an observation. They\r\ncould do nothing but wait. Smith was profoundly anxious. Had the\r\npirates been on the island before, since they hoisted their colors on\r\napproaching it? Might they not have effected a descent once before, and\r\nmight not some accomplice be now concealed in the unexplored part of\r\nthe island. They were determined to resist to the last extremity. All\r\ndepended on the arms and the number of the pirates.\r\n\r\nNight had come. The new moon had set a few moments after the sun.\r\nProfound darkness enveloped land and sea. Thick masses of clouds were\r\nspread over the sky. The wind had entirely died away. Nothing could be\r\nseen of the vessel, for all her lights were hidden—they could tell\r\nnothing of her whereabouts.\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” said Pencroff. “Perhaps the confounded ship will be off by\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\nHis speech was answered by a brilliant flash from the offing, and the\r\nsound of a gun. The ship was there, and she had artillery. Six seconds\r\nhad elapsed between the flash and the report; the brig, therefore, was\r\nabout a mile and a-quarter from the shore. Just then, they heard the\r\nnoise of chain-cables grinding across the hawse-holes. The vessel was\r\ncoming to anchor in sight of Granite House!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSIONS—PRESENTIMENTS—AYRTON’S PROPOSAL—IT IS ACCEPTED—AYRTON AND\r\nPENCROFF ON SAFETY ISLET—NORFOLK CONVICTS—THEIR PROJECTS—HEROIC ATTEMPT\r\nOF AYRTON—HIS RETURN—SIX AGAINST FIFTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no longer room for doubt as to the pirate’s intentions. They\r\nhad cast anchor at a short distance from the island, and evidently\r\nintended to land on the morrow.\r\n\r\nBrave as they were, the colonists felt the necessity of prudence.\r\nPerhaps their presence could yet be concealed in case the pirates were\r\ncontented with landing on the coast without going up into the interior.\r\nThe latter, in fact, might have nothing else in view than a supply of\r\nfresh water, and the bridge, a mile and a half up stream, might well\r\nescape their eye.\r\n\r\nThe colonists knew now that the pirate ship carried heavy artillery,\r\nagainst which they had nothing but a few shot-guns.\r\n\r\n“Still,” said Smith, “our situation is impregnable. The enemy cannot\r\ndiscover the opening in the weir, so thickly is it covered with reeds\r\nand grass, and consequently cannot penetrate into Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral,—in short\r\neverything,” cried Pencroff, stamping his foot. “They can destroy\r\neverything in a few hours.”\r\n\r\n“Everything, Pencroff!” answered Smith, “and we have no means of\r\npreventing them?”\r\n\r\n“Are there many of them?” said the reporter. “That’s the question. If\r\nthere are only a dozen, we can stop them, but forty, or fifty, or\r\nmore—”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” said Ayrton, coming up to the engineer, “will you grant me\r\none request!”\r\n\r\n“What, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“To go to the ship, and ascertain how strongly she is manned.”\r\n\r\n“But, Ayrton,” said the engineer, hesitating, “your life will be in\r\ndanger.”\r\n\r\n“And why not, sir?”\r\n\r\n“That is more than your duty.”\r\n\r\n“I must do more than my duty,” replied Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“You mean to go to the ship in the canoe?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No, sir. I will swim to her. A man can slip in where a boat could not\r\npass.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know that the brig is a mile and a half from the coast?” said\r\nHerbert.”\r\n\r\n“I am a good swimmer, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I repeat to you that you are risking your life,” resumed the engineer.\r\n\r\n“No matter,” answered Ayrton—”Mr. Smith, I ask it as a favor. It may\r\nraise me in my own estimation.”\r\n\r\n“Go, Ayrton,” said the engineer, who knew how deeply a refusal would\r\naffect the ex-convict, now become an honest man.\r\n\r\n“I will go with you,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“You distrust me!” said Ayrton, quickly. Then, he added, more humbly,\r\n“and it is just.”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” cried Smith, eagerly, “Pencroff has no such feeling. You have\r\nmisunderstood him.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” answered the sailor; “I am proposing to Ayrton to accompany\r\nhim only as far as the islet. One of these rascals may possibly have\r\ngone on shore there, and if so, it will take two men to prevent him\r\nfrom giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the islet.”\r\n\r\nEverything thus arranged, Ayrton got ready for departure. His project\r\nwas bold but not impracticable, thanks to the dark night. Once having\r\nreached the ship, Ayrton, by clinging to the chains of the shrouds,\r\nmight ascertain the number and perhaps the designs of the convicts.\r\nThey walked down upon the beach. Ayrton stripped himself and rubbed\r\nhimself with grease, the better to endure the chill of the water; for\r\nhe might have to be in it several hours. Meanwhile Pencroff and Neb had\r\ngone after the canoe, fastened on the bank of the Mercy some hundreds\r\nof paces further up. When they came back, Ayrton was ready to start.\r\n\r\nThey threw a wrap over his shoulders, and shook hands with him all\r\nround. Then he got into the boat with Pencroff, and pushed off into the\r\ndarkness. It was now half-past 10, and their companions went back to\r\nwait for them at the Chimneys.\r\n\r\nThe channel was crossed without difficulty, and the canoe reached the\r\nopposite bank of the islet. They moved cautiously, lest pirates should\r\nhave landed there. But the island was deserted. The two walked rapidly\r\nover it, frightening the birds from their nests in the rocks. Having\r\nreached the further side, Ayrton cast himself unhesitatingly into the\r\nsea, and swam noiselessly towards the ship’s lights, which now were\r\nstreaming across the water. Pencroff hid himself among the rocks, to\r\nawait his companion’s return.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ayrton swam strongly towards the ship, slipping through the\r\nwater. His head only appeared above the surface; his eyes were fixed on\r\nthe dark hull of the brig, whose lights were reflected in the water. He\r\nthought only of his errand, and nothing of the danger he encountered,\r\nnot only from the pirates but from the sharks which infested these\r\nwaters. The current was in his favor, and the shore was soon far\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been perceived by any\r\none, dived under the ship, and clung with one hand to the bowsprit.\r\nThen he drew breath, and, raising himself by the chains, climbed to the\r\nend of the cut-water. There some sailors’ clothes hung drying. He found\r\nan easy position, and listened.\r\n\r\nThey were not asleep on board of the brig. They were talking, singing,\r\nand laughing. These words, intermingled with oaths, came to Ayrton’s\r\nears;—\r\n\r\n“What a famous find our brig was!”\r\n\r\n“The Speedy is a fast sailor. She deserves her name.”\r\n\r\n“All the Norfolk shipping may do their best to take her.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for her commander. Hurrah for Bob Harvey!”\r\n\r\nOur readers will understand what emotion was excited in Ayrton by this\r\nname, when they learn that Bob Harvey was one of his old companions in\r\nAustralia, who had followed out his criminal projects by getting\r\npossession, off Norfolk Island, of this brig, charged with arms,\r\nammunition, utensils, and tools of all kinds, destined for one of the\r\nSandwich Islands. All his band had gotten on board, and, adding piracy\r\nto their other crimes, the wretches scoured the Pacific, destroying\r\nships and massacring their crews. They were drinking deep and talking\r\nloudly over their exploits, and Ayrton gathered the following facts:—\r\n\r\nThe crew were composed entirely of English convicts, escaped from\r\nNorfolk Island. In 29° 2’ south latitude, and 165° 42’ east longitude,\r\nto the east of Australia, is a little island about six leagues in\r\ncircumference, with Mount Pitt rising in the midst, 1,100 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea. It is Norfolk Island, the seat of an\r\nestablishment where are crowded together the most dangerous of the\r\ntransported English convicts. There are 500 of them; they undergo a\r\nrigid discipline, with severe punishment for disobedience, and are\r\nguarded by 150 soldiers and 150 civil servants, under the authority of\r\na Governor. A worse set of villains cannot be imagined. Sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, in spite of the extreme precautions of their jailors,\r\nsome of them contrive to escape by seizing a ship, and become the pest\r\nof the Polynesian archipelagos. Thus had done Harvey and his\r\ncompanions. Thus had Ayrton formerly wished to do. Harvey had seized\r\nthe Speedy, which was anchored within sight of Norfolk Island, had\r\nmassacred the crew, and for a year had made the brig the terror of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThe convicts were most of them gathered on the poop, in the after part\r\nof the ship; but a few were lying on deck, talking in loud voices. The\r\nconversation went on amid noise and drunkenness. Ayrton gathered that\r\nchance only had brought them within sight of Lincoln Island. Harvey had\r\nnever set foot there; but, as Smith had foreseen, coming upon an island\r\nnot in the maps, he had determined to go on shore, and, if the land\r\nsuited him, to make it the Speedy’s headquarters. The black flag and\r\nthe cannon-shot were a mere freak of the pirates, to imitate a\r\nship-of-war running up her colors.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were in very serious danger. The island, with its easy\r\nwater supply, its little harbor, its varied resources so well turned to\r\naccount by the colonists, its secret recesses of Granite House—all\r\nthese would be just what the convicts wanted. In their hands the island\r\nwould become an excellent place of refuge, and the fact of its being\r\nunknown would add to their security. Of course the colonists would\r\ninstantly be put to death. They could not even escape to the interior,\r\nfor the convicts would make the island their headquarters, and if they\r\nwent on an expedition would leave some of the crew behind. It would be\r\na struggle for life and death with these wretches, every one of whom\r\nmust be destroyed before the colonists would be safe. Those were\r\nAyrton’s thoughts, and he knew that Smith would agree with him. But was\r\na successful resistance possible? Everything depended on the calibre of\r\nthe brig’s guns and the number of her men. These were facts which\r\nAyrton must know at any cost.\r\n\r\nAn hour after he had reached the brig the noise began to subside, and\r\nmost of the convicts lay plunged in a drunken sleep. Ayrton determined\r\nto risk himself on the ship’s deck, which the extinguished lanterns\r\nleft in profound darkness. He got in the chains by the cut-water, and\r\nby means of the bowsprit climbed to the brig’s forecastle. Creeping\r\nquietly through the sleeping crew, who lay stretched here and there on\r\nthe deck, he walked completely around the vessel and ascertained that\r\nthe Speedy carried four guns, from eight to ten-pounders. He discovered\r\nalso that the guns were breech-loading, of modern make, easily worked,\r\nand capable of doing great damage.\r\n\r\nThere were about ten men lying on deck, but it might be that others\r\nwere asleep in the hold. Moreover, Ayrton had gathered from the\r\nconversation that there were some fifty on board; rather an overmatch\r\nfor the six colonists. But, at least, the latter would not be\r\nsurprised; thanks to Ayrton’s devotion, they would know their\r\nadversaries force, and would make their dispositions accordingly.\r\nNothing remained for Ayrton but to go back to his comrades with the\r\ninformation he had gathered, and he began walking towards the\r\nforecastle to let himself down into the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd now to this man, who wished to do more than his duty, there came a\r\nheroic thought, the thought of sacrificing his life for the safety of\r\nhis comrades. Smith could not of course resist fifty well-armed\r\nmarauders, who would either overcome him or starve him out. Ayrton\r\npictured to himself his preservers who had made a man of him, and an\r\nhonest man, to whom he owed everything, pitilessly murdered, their\r\nlabors brought to nothing, their island changed to a den of pirates. He\r\nsaid to himself that he, Ayrton, was the first cause of these\r\ndisasters, since his old companion, Harvey, had only carried out\r\nAyrton’s projects; and a feeling of horror came over him. Then came the\r\nirresistible desire to blow up the brig, with all on board. He would\r\nperish in the explosion, but he would have done his duty.\r\n\r\nHe did not hesitate! It was easy to reach the powder magazine, which is\r\nalways in the after part of the ship. Powder must be plenty on board\r\nsuch a vessel, and a spark would bring destruction.\r\n\r\nAyrton lowered himself carefully between-decks, where he found many of\r\nthe pirates lying about, overcome rather by drunkenness than sleep. A\r\nship’s lantern, was lighted at the foot of the mainmast, from which\r\nhung a rack full of all sorts of firearms. Ayrton took from the rack a\r\nrevolver, and made sure that it was loaded and capped. It was all that\r\nhe needed to accomplish the work of destruction. Then he glided back to\r\nthe poop, where the powder magazine would be.\r\n\r\nBetween decks it was dark, and he could hardly step without knocking\r\nagainst some half-asleep convict, and meeting with an oath or a blow.\r\nMore than once he had to stop short, but at length he reached the\r\npartition separating the after-compartment, and found the door of the\r\nmagazine. This he had to force, and it was a difficult matter to\r\naccomplish without noise, as he had to break a padlock. But at last,\r\nunder his vigorous hand, the padlock fell apart and the door opened.\r\n\r\nJust then a hand was laid upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing there?” said a harsh voice, and a tall form rose\r\nfrom the shadow and turned the light of a lantern fall on Ayrton’s\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAyrton turned around sharply. By a quick flash from the lantern, he saw\r\nhis old accomplice, Harvey; but the latter, believing Ayrton, as he\r\ndid, to be dead, failed to recognize him.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing there?” said Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the strap of\r\nhis trousers. Ayrton made no answer but a vigorous push, and sprang\r\nforward to the magazine. One shot into those tons of powder, and all\r\nwould have been over!\r\n\r\n“Help, lads!” cried Harvey.\r\n\r\nTwo or three pirates, roused by his voice, threw themselves upon\r\nAyrton, and strove to drag him to the ground. He rid himself of them\r\nwith two shots from his revolver; but received in so doing, a wound\r\nfrom a knife in the fleshy part of the shoulder. He saw in a moment\r\nthat his project was no longer feasible. Harvey had shut the door of\r\nthe magazine, and a dozen pirates were half-awake. He most save himself\r\nfor the sake of his comrades.\r\n\r\nFour barrels were left. He discharged two of them right and left, one\r\nat Harvey, though without effect; and then, profiting by his enemies’\r\nmomentary recoil, rushed towards the ladder which led to the deck of\r\nthe brig. As he passed the lantern he knocked it down with a blow from\r\nthe butt-end of his pistol, and left everything in darkness.\r\n\r\nTwo or three pirates, awakened by the noise, were coming down the\r\nladder at that moment. A fifth shot stretched one at the foot of the\r\nsteps, and the others got out of the way, not understanding what was\r\ngoing on. In two bounds Ayrton was on the brig’s deck, and three\r\nseconds afterwards, after discharging his last shot at a pirate who\r\ntried to seize him by the neck, he made his way down the netting and\r\nleaped into the sea. He had not swam six fathoms before the bullets\r\nbegan to whistle around him like hail.\r\n\r\nWhat were the feelings of Pencroff, hidden behind a rock on the islet,\r\nand of his comrades in the Chimneys, when they heard these shots from\r\nthe brig! They rushed out upon the shore, and, with their guns at their\r\nshoulders, stood ready to meet any attack. For them no doubt remained.\r\nThey believed that Ayrton had been killed, and the pirates were about\r\nto make a descent on the island. Thus half an hour passed away. They\r\nsuffered torments of anxiety. They could not go to the assistance of\r\nAyrton or Pencroff, for the boat had been taken, and the high tide\r\nforbade them crossing the channel.\r\n\r\nFinally, at half-past 12, a boat with two men came along shore. It was\r\nAyrton, with a slight wound in his shoulder, and Pencroff. Their\r\nfriends received them with open arms.\r\n\r\nThen all took refuge at the Chimneys. There Ayrton told them all that\r\nhappened, including his plan to blow up the brig.\r\n\r\nEvery one grasped the man’s hand, but the situation was desperate. The\r\npirates knew that Lincoln Island was inhabited, and would come down\r\nupon it in force. They would respect nothing. If the colonists fell\r\ninto their hands they had no mercy to hope for!\r\n\r\n“We can die like men,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Let us go in and keep watch,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Do you think there is any chance, Mr. Smith?” said the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\n“How! Six against fifty!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, six—and one other—”\r\n\r\n“Who?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\nSmith did not answer, but he looked upwards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIST RISES—THE ENGINEER’S DISPOSITION OF FORCES—THREE POSTS—AYRTON\r\nAND PENCROFF—THE FIRST ATTACK —TWO OTHER BOAT LOADS—ON THE ISLET—SIX\r\nCONVICTS ON SHORE—THE BRIG WEIGHS ANCHOR—THE SPEEDY’S\r\nPROJECTILES—DESPERATE SITUATION—UNEXPECTED DENOUEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night passed without incident. The colonists were still at the\r\nChimneys, keeping a constant lookout. The pirates made no attempt at\r\nlanding. Since the last shots fired at Ayrton, not a sound betrayed the\r\npresence of the brig in the bay. They might have supposed she had\r\nweighed anchor and gone off in the night.\r\n\r\nBut it was not so, and when daylight began to appear the colonists\r\ncould see her dark hulk dim through the morning mists.\r\n\r\n“Listen, my friends,” then said the engineer. “These are the\r\ndispositions it seems to me best to make before the mist dispels, which\r\nconceals us from view. We must make these convicts believe that the\r\ninhabitants of the island are numerous and well able to resist them.\r\nLet us divide ourselves into three groups, one posted at the Chimneys,\r\none at the mouth of the Mercy, and the third upon the islet, to hinder,\r\nor at least, retard, every attempt to land. We have two carbines and\r\nfour guns, so that each of us will be armed; and as we have plenty of\r\npowder and ball, we will not spare our shots. We have nothing to fear\r\nfrom the guns, nor even from the cannon of the brig. What can they\r\neffect against these rocks? And as we shall not shoot from the windows\r\nof Granite House, the pirates will never think of turning their guns\r\nupon it. What we have to fear is a hand-to-hand fight with an enemy\r\ngreatly superior in numbers. We must try to prevent their landing\r\nwithout showing ourselves. So don’t spare your ammunition. Shoot fast,\r\nand shoot straight. Each of us has eight or ten enemies to kill, and\r\nmust kill them.”\r\n\r\nSmith had precisely defined the situation, in a voice as quiet as if he\r\nwere directing some ordinary work. His companions acted upon his\r\nproposal without a word. Each hastened to take his place before the\r\nmist should be entirely dissipated.\r\n\r\nNeb and Pencroff went back to Granite House and brought back thence\r\nabundance of ammunition. Spilett and Ayrton, both excellent shots, were\r\narmed with the two carbines, which would carry nearly a mile. The four\r\nshot-guns were divided between Smith, Neb, Pencroff, and Herbert. The\r\nposts were thus filled:—Smith and Herbert remained in ambush at the\r\nChimneys, commanding a large radius of the shore in front of Granite\r\nHouse. Spilett and Neb hid themselves among the rocks at the mouth of\r\nthe Mercy (the bridge and causeways over which had been removed), so as\r\nto oppose the passage of any boat or even any landing on the opposite\r\nside. As to Ayrton and Pencroff, they pushed the canoe into the water,\r\nand got ready to push across the channel, to occupy two different\r\npoints on the islet, so that the firing, coming from four different\r\npoints, might convince the pirates that the island was both well manned\r\nand vigorously defended.\r\n\r\nIn case a landing should be effected in spite of their opposition, or\r\nshould they be in danger of being cut off by a boat from the brig,\r\nPencroff and Ayrton could return with the canoe to the shore of the\r\nisland, and hasten to the threatened point.\r\n\r\nBefore going to their posts, the colonists shook hands all round.\r\nPencroff concealed his emotion as he embraced “his boy” Herbert, and\r\nthey parted. A few minutes afterwards each was at his post. None of\r\nthem could have been seen, for the brig itself was barely visible\r\nthrough the mist. It was half-past 6 in the morning. Soon the mist rose\r\ngradually; the ocean was covered with ripples, and, a breeze rising,\r\nthe sky was soon clear. The Speedy appeared, anchored by two cables,\r\nher head to the north, and her larboard quarter to the island. As Smith\r\nhad calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from the\r\nshore. The ominous black flag floated at the peak. The engineer could\r\nsee with his glass that the four guns of the ship had been trained on\r\nthe island, ready to be fired at the first signal; but so far there was\r\nno sound. Full thirty pirates could be seen coming and going on the\r\ndeck. Some were on the poop; two on the transoms of the main topmast\r\nwere examining the island with spy-glasses. In fact, Harvey and his\r\ncrew must have been exceedingly puzzled by the adventure of the night,\r\nand especially by Ayrton’s attempt upon the powder magazine. But they\r\ncould not doubt that the island before them was inhabited by a colony\r\nready to defend it. Yet no one could be seen either on the shore or the\r\nhigh ground.\r\n\r\nFor an hour and a half there was no sign of attack from the brig.\r\nEvidently Harvey was hesitating. But about 8 o’clock there was a\r\nmovement on board. They were hauling at the tackle, and a boat was\r\nbeing let down into the sea. Seven men jumped into it, their guns in\r\ntheir hands. One was at the tiller, four at the oars, and the two\r\nothers squatting in the bow, ready to shoot, examined the island. No\r\ndoubt their intention was to make a reconnoissance, and not to land, or\r\nthey would have come in greater number.\r\n\r\nThe pirates, perched on the rigging of the topmast, had evidently\r\nperceived that an islet concealed the shore, lying about half a mile\r\naway. The boat was apparently not running for the channel, but was\r\nmaking for the islet, as the most prudent beginning of the\r\nreconnoissance. Pencroff and Ayrton, lying hidden among the rocks, saw\r\nit coming down upon them, and even waiting for it to get within good\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nIt came on with extreme caution. The oars fell at considerable\r\nintervals. One of the convicts seated in front had a sounding-line in\r\nhis hand, with which he was feeling for the increased depth of water\r\ncaused by the current of the Mercy. This indicated Harvey’s intention\r\nof bringing his brig as near shore as possible. About thirty pirates\r\nwere scattered among the shrouds watching the boat and noting certain\r\nsea-marks which would enable them to land without danger. The boat was\r\nbut two cables’ length from the islet when it stopped. The helmsman,\r\nstanding erect, was trying to find the best place to land. In a moment\r\nburst forth a double flash and report. The helmsman and the man with\r\nthe line fell over into the boat. Ayrton and Pencroff had done their\r\nwork. Almost at once came a puff of smoke from the brig, and a cannon\r\nball struck the rock, at whose foot the two lay sheltered, making it\r\nfly into shivers; but the marksmen remained unhurt.\r\n\r\nWith horrible imprecations the boat resumed its course. The helmsman\r\nwas replaced by one of his comrades, and the crew bent to their oars,\r\neager to get beyond reach of bullets. Instead of turning back, they\r\npulled for the southern extremity of the islet, evidently with the\r\nintention of coming up on the other side and putting Pencroff and\r\nAyrton between two fires. A quarter of an hour passed thus without a\r\nsound. The defenders of the islet, though they understood the object of\r\nthe flanking movement, did not leave their post. They feared the cannon\r\nof the Speedy, and counted upon their comrades in ambush.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes after the first shots, the boat was less than two\r\ncables’ length off the Mercy. The tide was running up stream with its\r\ncustomary swiftness, due to the narrowness of the river, and the\r\nconvicts had to row hard to keep themselves in the middle of the\r\nchannel. But as they were passing within easy range of the river’s\r\nmouth, two reports were heard, and two of the crew fell back into the\r\nboat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their shot. The brig opened fire\r\nupon their hiding place, which was indicated by the puff of smoke; but\r\nwith no result beyond shivering a few rocks.\r\n\r\nThe boat now contained only three men fit for action. Getting into the\r\ncurrent, it shot up the channel like an arrow, passed Smith and\r\nHerbert, who feared to waste a shot upon it, and turned the northern\r\npoint of the islet, whence the two remaining oarsmen pulled across to\r\nthe brig.\r\n\r\nSo far the colonists could not complain. Their adversaries had lost the\r\nfirst point in the game. Four pirates had been grievously wounded,\r\nperhaps killed, while they were without a scratch. Moreover, from the\r\nskilful disposition of their little force, it had no doubt given the\r\nimpression of a much greater number.\r\n\r\nA half hour elapsed before the boat, which was rowing against the\r\ncurrent, could reach the Speedy. The wounded were lifted on deck, amid\r\nhowls of rage. A dozen furious convicts manned the boat; another was\r\nlowered into the sea, and eight more jumped into it; and while the\r\nformer rowed straight for the islet, the latter steered around its\r\nsouthern point, heading for the Mercy.\r\n\r\nPencroff and Ayrton were in a perilous situation. They waited till the\r\nfirst boat was within easy range, sent two balls into her, to the great\r\ndiscomfort of the crew; then they took to their heels, running the\r\ngauntlet of a dozen shots, reached their canoe on the other side of the\r\nislet, crossed the channel just as the second boat load of pirates\r\nrounded the southern point, and hastened to hide themselves at the\r\nChimneys. They had hardly rejoined Smith and Herbert, when the islet\r\nwas surrounded and thoroughly searched by the pirates.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment shots were heard from the mouth of the Mercy.\r\nAs the second boat approached them, Spilett and Neb disposed of two of\r\nthe crew; and the boat itself was irresistibly hurried upon the rocks\r\nat the mouth of the river. The six survivors, holding their guns above\r\ntheir heads to keep them from contact with the water, succeeded in\r\ngetting on shore on the right bank of the river; and, finding\r\nthemselves exposed to the fire of a hidden enemy, made off towards\r\nJetsam Point, and were soon out of range.\r\n\r\nOn the islet, therefore, there were twelve convicts, of whom some no\r\ndoubt were wounded, but who had a boat at their service. Six more had\r\nlanded on the island itself, but Granite House was safe from them, for\r\nthey could rot get across the river, the bridges over which were\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of the situation, Mr. Smith?” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said the engineer, “that unless these rascals are very\r\nstupid, the battle will soon take a new form.”\r\n\r\n“They will never get across the channel,” said Pencroff. “Ayrton and\r\nMr. Spilett have guns that will carry a mile!”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” said Herbert, “but of what avail are two carbines against\r\nthe brig’s cannon?”\r\n\r\n“The brig is not in the channel yet,” replied Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“And suppose she comes there?” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“She will risk foundering and utter destruction.”\r\n\r\n“Still it is possible,” said Ayrton. “The convicts may profit by the\r\nhigh tide to run into the channel, taking the risk of running aground;\r\nand then, under their heavy guns, our position will become untenable.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” said the sailor, “the beggars are weighing anchor.”\r\n\r\nIt was but too true. The Speedy began to heave her anchor, and showed\r\nher intention of approaching the islet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the pirates on the islet had collected on the brink of the\r\nchannel. They knew that the colonists were out of reach of their\r\nshot-guns, but forgot that their enemies, might carry weapons of longer\r\nrange. Suddenly, the carbines of Ayrton and Spilett rang out together,\r\ncarrying news to the convicts, which must have been very disagreeable,\r\nfor two of them fell flat on their faces. There was a general scamper.\r\nThe other ten, leaving their wounded or dying comrades, rushed to the\r\nother side of the islet, sprang into the boat which had brought them\r\nover, and rowed rapidly off.\r\n\r\n“Eight off!” cried Pencroff, exultingly.\r\n\r\nBut a more serious danger was at hand. The Speedy had raised her\r\nanchor, and was steadily nearing the shore. From their two posts at the\r\nMercy and the Chimneys, the colonists watched her movements without\r\nstirring a finger, but not without lively apprehension. Their situation\r\nwould be most critical, exposed as they would be at short range to the\r\nbrig’s cannon, without power to reply by an effective fire. How then\r\ncould they prevent the pirates from landing?\r\n\r\nSmith felt that in a few minutes he must make up his mind what to do.\r\nShould they shut themselves up in Granite House, and stand a siege\r\nthere? But their enemies would thus become masters of the island, and\r\nstarve them out at leisure. One chance was still left; perhaps Harvey\r\nwould not risk his ship in the channel. If he kept outside his shots\r\nwould be fired from a distance of half a mile, and would do little\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n“Bob Harvey is too good a sailor,” repeated Pencroff, “to risk his ship\r\nin the channel. He knows that he would certainly lose her if the sea\r\nturned rough! And what would become of him without his ship?”\r\n\r\nBut the brig came nearer and nearer, and was evidently heading for the\r\nlower extremity of the islet. The breeze was faint, the current slack,\r\nand Harvey could manœuvre in safety. The route followed by the boats\r\nhad enabled him to ascertain where the mouth of the river was, and he\r\nwas making for it with the greatest audacity. He intended to bring his\r\nbroadside to bear on the Chimneys, and to riddle them with shell and\r\ncannon balls. The Speedy soon reached the extremity of the islet,\r\neasily turning it, and, with a favoring wind, was soon off the Mercy.\r\n\r\n“The villains are here!” cried Pencroff. As he spoke, Neb and Spilett\r\nrejoined their comrades. They could do nothing against the ship, and it\r\nwas better that the colonists should be together when the decisive\r\naction was about to take place. Neither of the two were injured, though\r\na shower of balls had been poured upon them as they ran from rock to\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n“You are not wounded, lad?” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“No, only a few contusions from the ricochet of a ball. But that cursed\r\nbrig is in the channel!”\r\n\r\n“We must take refuge in Granite House,” said Smith, “while we have\r\ntime, and before the convicts can see us. Once inside, we can act as\r\nthe occasion demands.”\r\n\r\n“Let us start at once, then,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\nThere was not a moment to lose. Two or three detonations, and the thud\r\nof balls on the rocks apprised them that the Speedy was near at hand.\r\n\r\nTo jump into the elevator, to hoist themselves to the door of Granite\r\nHouse, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the day before, and to\r\nrush into the great hall, was the work of a moment. Through the leaves\r\nthey saw the Speedy, environed with smoke, moving up the channel. They\r\nhad not left a moment too soon, for balls were crashing everywhere\r\nthrough the hiding places they had quitted. The rocks were splintered\r\nto pieces.\r\n\r\nStill they hoped that Granite House would escape notice behind its\r\nleafy covering, when suddenly a ball passed through the doorway and\r\npenetrated into the corridor.\r\n\r\n“The devil! we are discovered!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the colonists had not been seen, and Harvey had only\r\nsuspected that something lay behind the leafy screen of the rock. And\r\nsoon another ball, tearing apart the foliage, exposed the opening in\r\nthe granite.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the colonists was now desperate. They could make no\r\nanswer to the fire, under which the rock was crashing around them.\r\nNothing remained but to take refuge in the upper corridor of Granite\r\nHouse, giving up their abode to devastation, when a hollow sound was\r\nheard, followed by dreadful shrieks!\r\n\r\nSmith and his comrades rushed to the window.\r\n\r\nThe brig, lifted on the summit of a sort of waterspout, had just split\r\nin half; and in less than ten seconds she went to the bottom with her\r\nwicked crew!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONISTS ON THE BEACH—AYRTON AND PENCROFF AS SALVORS—TALK AT\r\nBREAKFAST—PENCROFF’S REASONING—EXPLORATION OF THE BRIG’S HULL IN\r\nDETAIL—THE MAGAZINE UNINJURED—NEW RICHES—A DISCOVERY—A PIECE OF A\r\nBROKEN CYLINDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n“They have blown up!” cried Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, blown up as if Ayrton had fired the magazine,” answered Pencroff,\r\njumping into the elevator with Neb and the boy,\r\n\r\n“But what has happened?” said Spilett, still stupefied at the\r\nunexpected issue.\r\n\r\n“Ah, this time we shall find out—” said the engineer,\r\n\r\n“What shall we find out?”\r\n\r\n“All in time; the chief thing is that the pirates have been disposed\r\nof.”\r\n\r\nAnd they rejoined the rest of the party on beach. Not a sign of the\r\nbrig could be seen, not even the masts. After having been upheaved by\r\nthe water-spout, it had fallen back upon its side, and had sunk in this\r\nposition, doubtless owing to some enormous leak.’ As the channel here\r\nwas only twenty feet deep, the masts of the brig would certainly\r\nreappear at low tide.\r\n\r\nSome waifs were floating on the surface of the sea. There was a whole\r\nfloat, made up of masts and spare yards, chicken coops with the fowls\r\nstill living, casks and barrels, which little by little rose to the\r\nsurface, having escaped by the traps; but no debris was adrift, no\r\nflooring of the deck, no plankage of the hull; and the sudden sinking\r\nof the Speedy seemed still more inexplicable.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two masts, which had been broken some feet above the\r\n“partner,” after having snapped their stays and shrouds, soon rose to\r\nthe surface of the channel, with their sails attached, some of them\r\nfurled and some unfurled. But they could not wait for low tide to carry\r\naway all their riches, and Ayrton and Pencroff jumped into the canoe,\r\nfor the purpose of lashing these waifs either to the shore of the\r\nisland or of the islet. But just as they were about to start, they were\r\nstopped by a word from Spilett.\r\n\r\n“And the six convicts who landed on the right bank of the Mercy,” said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was as well to remember the six men who had landed at\r\nJetsam Point, when their boat was wrecked off the rocks. They looked in\r\nthat direction, but the fugitives were not to be seen. Very likely,\r\nwhen they saw the brig go down, they had taken flight into the interior\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\n“We will see after them later,” said Smith. “They may still be\r\ndangerous, for they are armed; but with six to six, we have an even\r\nchance. Now we have more urgent work on hand.”\r\n\r\nAyrton and Pencroff jumped into the canoe and pulled vigorously out to\r\nthe wreck. The sea was quiet now and very high, for the moon was only\r\ntwo days old. It would be a full hour before the hull of the brig would\r\nappear above the water of the channel.\r\n\r\nAyrton and Pencroff had time enough to lash together the masts and\r\nspars by means of ropes, whose other end was carried along the shore to\r\nGranite House, where the united efforts of the colonists succeeded in\r\nhauling them in. Then the canoe picked up the chicken coops, barrels,\r\nand casks which were floating in the water, and brought them to the\r\nChimneys.\r\n\r\nA few dead bodies were also floating on the surface. Among them Ayrton\r\nrecognized that of Bob Harvey, and pointed it out to his companion,\r\nsaying with emotion:—\r\n\r\n“That’s what I was, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\n“But what you are no longer, my worthy fellow,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious thing that so few bodies could be seen floating on the\r\nsurface. They could count only five or six, which the current was\r\nalready carrying out to sea. Very likely the convicts, taken by\r\nsurprise, had not had time to escape, and the ship having sunk on its\r\nside, the greater part of the crew were left entangled under the\r\nnettings. So the ebb which was carrying the bodies of these wretches\r\nout to sea would spare the colonists the unpleasant task of burying\r\nthem on the island.\r\n\r\nFor two hours Smith and his companions were wholly occupied with\r\nhauling the spars up on the sands, and in unfurling the sails, which\r\nwere entirely uninjured, and spreading them out to dry. The work was so\r\nabsorbing that they talked but little; but they had time for thought.\r\nWhat a fortune was the possession of the brig, or rather of the brig’s\r\ncontents! A ship is a miniature world, and the colonists could add to\r\ntheir stock a host of useful articles. It was a repetition, on a large\r\nscale, of the chest found on Jetsam Point.\r\n\r\n“Moreover,” thought Pencroff, “why should it be impossible to get this\r\nbrig afloat? If she has only one leak, a leak can be stopped up, and a\r\nship of 300 or 400 tons is a real ship compared to our Good Luck! We\r\nwould go where we pleased in her. We must look into this matter. It is\r\nwell worth the trouble.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, if the brig could be repaired, their chance of getting home\r\nagain would be very much greater. But in order to decide this important\r\nquestion, they must wait until the tide was at its lowest, so that the\r\nbrig’s hull could be examined in every part.\r\n\r\nAfter their prizes had been secured upon the beach, Smith and his\r\ncompanions, who were nearly famished, allowed themselves a few minutes\r\nfor breakfast. Fortunately the kitchen was not far off, and Neb could\r\ncook them a good breakfast in a jiffy. They took this meal at the\r\nChimneys, and one can well suppose that they talked of nothing during\r\nthe repast but the miraculous deliverance of the colony.\r\n\r\n“Miraculous is the word,” repeated Pencroff, “for we must own that\r\nthese blackguards were blown up just in time! Granite House was\r\nbecoming rather uncomfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Can you imagine, Pencroff, how it happened that the brig blew up?”\r\nasked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Mr. Spilett; nothing is more simple,” replied Pencroff. “A\r\npirate is not under the same discipline as a ship-of-war. Convicts\r\ndon’t make sailors. The brig’s magazine must have been open, since she\r\ncannonaded us incessantly, and one awkward fellow might have blown up\r\nthe ship.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” said Herbert, “what astonishes me is that this explosion\r\ndid not produce more effect. The detonation was not loud, and the ship\r\nis very little broken up. She seems rather to have sunk than to have\r\nblown up.”\r\n\r\n“That astonishes you, does it, my boy?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And it astonishes me too, Herbert,” replied the engineer; “but when we\r\nexamine the hull of the brig, we shall find some explanation of this\r\nmystery.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff, “you don’t mean to say that the Speedy\r\nhas just sunk like a ship which strikes upon a rock?”\r\n\r\n“Why not,” asked Neb, “if there are rocks in the channel?”\r\n\r\n“Good, Neb,” said Pencroff. “You did not look at the right minute. An\r\ninstant before she went down I saw the brig rise on an enormous wave,\r\nand fall back over to larboard. Now, if she had struck a rock, she’d\r\nhave gone straight to the bottom like an honest ship.”\r\n\r\n“And that’s just what she is not,” said Neb.\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll soon find out, Pencroff,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“We will find out,” added the sailor, “but I’ll bet my head there are\r\nno rocks in the channel. But do you really think, Mr. Smith, that there\r\nis anything wonderful in this event?”\r\n\r\nSmith did not answer.\r\n\r\n“At all events,” said Spilett, “whether shock or explosion, you must\r\nown, Pencroff, that it came in good time.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! yes!” replied the sailor, “but that is not the question. I ask\r\nMr. Smith if he sees anything supernatural in this affair?”\r\n\r\n“I give no opinion, Pencroff,” said the engineer; a reply which was not\r\nsatisfactory to Pencroff, who believed in the explosion theory, and was\r\nreluctant to give it up. He refused to believe that in the channel\r\nwhich he had crossed so often at low tide, and whose bottom was covered\r\nwith sand as fine as that of the beach, there existed an unknown reef.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past 1, the colonists got into the canoe, and pulled out\r\nto the stranded brig. It was a pity that her two boats had not been\r\nsaved; but one, they knew, had gone to pieces at the mouth of the\r\nMercy, and was absolutely useless, and the other had gone down with the\r\nbrig, and had never reappeared.\r\n\r\nJust then the hull of the Speedy began to show itself above the water.\r\nThe brig had turned almost upside down, for after having broken its\r\nmasts under the weight of its ballast, displaced by the fall, it lay\r\nwith its keel in the air. The colonists rowed all around the hull, and\r\nas the tide fell, they perceived, if not the cause of the catastrophe,\r\nat least the effect produced. In the fore part of the brig, on both\r\nsides of the hull, seven or eight feet before the beginning of the\r\nstem, the sides were fearfully shattered for at least twenty feet.\r\nThere yawned two large leaks which it would have been impossible to\r\nstop. Not only had the copper sheathing and the planking disappeared,\r\nno doubt ground to powder, but there was not a trace of the timbers,\r\nthe iron bolts, and the treenails which fastened them. The false-keel\r\nhad been torn off with surprising violence, and the keel itself, torn\r\nfrom the carlines in several places, was broken its whole length.\r\n\r\n“The deuce!” cried Pencroff, “here’s a ship which will be hard to set\r\nafloat.”\r\n\r\n“Hard! It will be impossible,” said Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“At all events,” said Spilett, “the explosion, if there has been an\r\nexplosion, has produced the most remarkable effects. It has smashed the\r\nlower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and the\r\ntopsides. These great leaks seem rather to have been made by striking a\r\nreef than by the explosion of a magazine.”\r\n\r\n“There’s not a reef in the channel,” answered the sailor. “I will admit\r\nanything but striking a reef.”\r\n\r\n“Let us try to get into the hold,” said the engineer. “Perhaps that\r\nwill help us to discover the cause of the disaster.”\r\n\r\nThis was the best course to take, and would moreover enable them to\r\nmake an inventory of the treasures contained in the brig, and to get\r\nthem ready for transportation to the island. Access to the hold was now\r\neasy; the tide continued to fall, and the lower deck, which, as the\r\nbrig lay, was now uppermost, could easily be reached. The ballast,\r\ncomposed of heavy pigs of cast iron, had staved it in several places.\r\nThey heard the roaring of the sea, as it rushed through the fissures of\r\nthe hull.\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions, axe in hand, walked along the shattered deck.\r\nAll kinds of chests encumbered it, and as they had not been long under\r\nwater, perhaps their contents had not been damaged.\r\n\r\nThey set to work at once to put this cargo in safety. The tide would\r\nnot return for some hours, and these hours were utilized to the utmost\r\nat the opening into the hull. Ayrton and Pencroff had seized upon\r\ntackle which served to hoist the barrels and chests. The canoe received\r\nthem, and took them ashore at once. They took everything\r\nindiscriminately, and left the sorting of their prizes to the future.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the colonists, to their extreme satisfaction, had made\r\nsure that the brig possessed a varied cargo, an assortment of all kinds\r\nof articles, utensils, manufactured products, and tools, such as ships\r\nare loaded with for the coasting trade of Polynesia. They would\r\nprobably find there a little of everything, which was precisely what\r\nthey needed on Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Smith noticed, in silent astonishment, that not only the\r\nhull of the brig had suffered frightfully from whatever shock it was\r\nwhich caused the catastrophe, but the machinery was destroyed,\r\nespecially in the fore part. Partitions and stanchions were torn down\r\nas if some enormous shell had burst inside of the brig. The colonists,\r\nby piling on one side the boxes which littered their path, could easily\r\ngo from stem to stern. They were not heavy bales which would have been\r\ndifficult to handle, but mere packages thrown about in utter confusion.\r\n\r\nThe colonists soon reached that part of the stern where the poop\r\nformerly stood. It was here Ayrton told them they must search for the\r\npowder magazine. Smith, believing that this had not exploded, thought\r\nthey might save some barrels, and that the powder, which is usually in\r\nmetal cases, had not been damaged by the water. In fact, this was just\r\nwhat had happened. They found, among a quantity of projectiles, at\r\nleast twenty barrels, which were lined with copper, and which they\r\npulled out with great care. Pencroff was now convinced by his own eyes\r\nthat the destruction of the Speedy could not have been caused by an\r\nexplosion. The part of the hull in which the powder magazine was\r\nsituated was precisely the part which had suffered the least.\r\n\r\n“It may be so,” replied the obstinate sailor, “but as to a rock, there\r\nis not one in the channel.” Then he added:—”I know nothing about it,\r\neven Mr. Smith does not know. No one knows, or ever will.”\r\n\r\nSeveral hours passed in these researches, and the tide was beginning to\r\nrise. They had to stop their work of salvage, but there was no fear\r\nthat the wreck would be washed out to sea, for it was as solidly\r\nimbedded as if it had been anchored to the bottom. They could wait with\r\nimpunity for the turn of the tide to commence operations. As to the\r\nship itself, it was of no use; but they must hasten to save the debris\r\nof the hull, which would not take long to disappear in the shifting\r\nsands of the channel.\r\n\r\nIt was 5 o’clock in the afternoon. The day had been a hard one, and\r\nthey sat down to their dinner with great appetite; but afterwards,\r\nnotwithstanding their fatigue, they could not resist the desire of\r\nexamining some of the chests. Most of them contained ready-made\r\nclothes, which, as may be imagined, were very welcome. There was enough\r\nto clothe a whole colony, linen of every description, boots of all\r\nsizes.\r\n\r\n“Now we are too rich,” cried Pencroff. “What shall we do with all these\r\nthings?”\r\n\r\nEvery moment the sailor uttered exclamations of joy, as he came upon\r\nbarrels of molasses and rum, hogsheads of tobacco, muskets and\r\nside-arms, bales of cotton, agricultural implements, carpenters’ and\r\nsmiths’ tools, and packages of seeds of every kind, uninjured by their\r\nshort sojourn in the water. Two years before, how these things would\r\nhave come in season! But even now that the industrious colonists were\r\nso well supplied, these riches would be put to use.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of storage room in Granite House, but time failed them\r\nnow to put everything in safety. They must not forget that six\r\nsurvivors of the Speedy’s crew were now on the island, scoundrels of\r\nthe deepest dye, against whom they must be on their guard.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bridge over the Mercy and the culverts had been raised,\r\nthe convicts would make little account of a river or a brook; and,\r\nurged by despair, these rascals would be formidable. Later, the\r\ncolonists could decide what course to take with regard to them; in the\r\nmeantime, the chests and packages piled up near the Chimneys must be\r\nwatched over, and to this they devoted themselves during the night.\r\n\r\nThe night passed, however, without any attack from the convicts. Master\r\nJup and Top, of the Granite House guard, would have been quick to give\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe three days which followed, the 19th, 20th, and 21st of October,\r\nwere employed in carrying on shore everything of value either in the\r\ncargo or in the rigging. At low tide they cleaned out the hold, and at\r\nhigh tide, stowed away their prizes. A great part of the copper\r\nsheathing could be wrenched from the hull, which every day sank deeper;\r\nbut before the sands had swallowed up the heavy articles which had sunk\r\nto the bottom, Ayrton and Pencroff dived and brought up the chains and\r\nanchors of the brig, the iron ballast, and as many as four cannon,\r\nwhich could be eased along upon empty barrels and brought to land; so\r\nthat the arsenal of the colony gained as much from the wreck as the\r\nkitchens and store-rooms. Pencroff, always enthusiastic in his\r\nprojects, talked already about constructing a battery which should\r\ncommand the channel and the mouth of the river. With four cannon, he\r\nwould guarantee to prevent any fleet, however powerful, from coming\r\nwithin gunshot of the island.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after nothing of the brig had been left but a useless shell,\r\nthe bad weather came to finish its destruction. Smith had intended to\r\nblow it up, so as to collect the debris on shore, but a strong\r\nnortheast wind and a high sea saved his powder for him. On the night of\r\nthe 23d, the hull was thoroughly broken up, and part of the wreck\r\nstranded on the beach. As to the ship’s papers, it is needless to say,\r\nalthough they carefully rummaged the closet in the poop, Smith found no\r\ntrace of them. The pirates had evidently destroyed all that concerned\r\neither the captain or the owner of the Speedy, and as the name of its\r\nport was not painted on the stern, there was nothing to betray its\r\nnationality. However, from the shape of the bow, Ayrton and Pencroff\r\nbelieved the brig to be of English construction.\r\n\r\nA week after the ship went down, not a trace of her was to be seen even\r\nat low tide. The wreck had gone to pieces, and Granite House had been\r\nenriched with almost all its contents. But the mystery of its strange\r\ndestruction would never have been cleared up, if Neb, rambling along\r\nthe beach, had not come upon a piece of a thick iron cylinder, which\r\nbore traces of an explosion. It was twisted and torn at the edge, as if\r\nit had been submitted to the action of an explosive substance. Neb took\r\nit to his master, who was busy with his companions in the workshop at\r\nthe Chimneys. Smith examined it carefully, and then turned to Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Do you still maintain, my friend,” said he, “that the Speedy did not\r\nperish by a collision?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Smith,” replied the sailor, “you know as well as I that there\r\nare no rocks in the channel.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose it struck against this piece of iron?” said the engineer,\r\nshowing the broken cylinder.\r\n\r\n“What, that pipe stem!” said Pencroff, incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember, my friends,” continued Smith, “that before foundering\r\nthe brig was lifted up by a sort of waterspout?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Smith,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well, this was the cause of the waterspout,” said Smith, holding up\r\nthe broken tube.\r\n\r\n“That?” answered Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Yes; this cylinder is all that is left of a torpedo!”\r\n\r\n“A torpedo!” cried they all.\r\n\r\n“And who put a torpedo there?” asked Pencroff, unwilling to give up.\r\n\r\n“That I cannot tell you,” said Smith, “but there it was, and you\r\nwitnessed its tremendous effects!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGINEER’S THEORY—PENCROFF’S MAGNIFICENT SUPPOSITIONS—A BATTERY IN\r\nTHE AIR—FOUR PROJECTILES—THE SURVIVING CONVICTS—AYRTON\r\nHESITATES—SMITH’S GENEROSITY AND PENCROFF’S DISSATISFACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, then, everything was explained by the submarine action of this\r\ntorpedo. Smith had had some experience during the civil war of these\r\nterrible engines of destruction, and was not likely to be mistaken.\r\nThis cylinder, charged with nitro-glycerine, had been the cause of the\r\ncolumn of water rising in the air, of the sinking of the brig, and of\r\nthe shattered condition of her hull. Everything was accounted for,\r\nexcept the presence of this torpedo in the waters of the channel!\r\n\r\n“My friends,” resumed Smith, “we can no longer doubt the existence of\r\nsome mysterious being, perhaps a castaway like ourselves, inhabiting\r\nour island. I say this that Ayrton may be informed of all the strange\r\nevents which have happened for two years. Who our unknown benefactor\r\nmay be, I cannot say, nor why he should hide himself after rendering us\r\nso many services; but his services are not the less real, and such as\r\nonly a man could render who wielded some prodigious power. Ayrton is\r\nhis debtor as well; as he saved me from drowning after the fall of the\r\nballoon, so he wrote the document, set the bottle afloat in the\r\nchannel, and gave us information of our comrade’s condition. He\r\nstranded on Jetsam Point that chest, full of all that we needed; he\r\nlighted that fire on the heights of the island which showed you where\r\nto land; he fired that ball which we found in the body of the peccary;\r\nhe immersed in the channel that torpedo which destroyed the brig; in\r\nshort, he has done all those inexplicable things of which we could find\r\nno explanation. Whatever he is, then, whether a castaway or an exile,\r\nwe should be ungrateful not to feel how much we owe him. Some day, I\r\nhope, we shall discharge our debt.”\r\n\r\n“We may add,” replied Spilett, “that this unknown friend has a way of\r\ndoing things which seems supernatural. If he did all these wonderful\r\nthings, he possesses a power which makes him master of the elements.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Smith, “there is a mystery here, but if we discover the man\r\nwe shall discover the mystery also. The question is this:—Shall we\r\nrespect the incognito of this generous being, or should we try to find\r\nhim? What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Master,” said Neb, “I have an idea that we may hunt for him as long as\r\nwe please, but that we shall only find him when he chooses to make\r\nhimself known.”\r\n\r\n“There’s something in that, Neb,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“I agree with you, Neb,” said Spilett; “but that is no reason for not\r\nmaking the attempt. Whether we find this mysterious being or not, we\r\nshall have fulfilled our duty towards him.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your opinion, my boy?” said the engineer, turning to\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” cried Herbert, his eye brightening; “I want to thank him, the man\r\nwho saved you first and now has saved us all.”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be unpleasant for any of us, my boy,” returned Pencroff.\r\n“I am not curious, but I would give one of my eyes to see him face to\r\nface.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Ayrton?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” replied Ayrton, “I can give no advice. Whatever you do\r\nwill be right, and whenever you want my help in your search, I am\r\nready.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Ayrton,” said Smith, “but I want a more direct answer. You are\r\nour comrade, who has offered his life more than once to save ours, and\r\nwe will take no important step without consulting you.”\r\n\r\n“I think, Mr. Smith,” replied Ayrton, “that we ought to do everything\r\nto discover our unknown benefactor. He may be sick or suffering. I owe\r\nhim a debt of gratitude which I can never forget, for he brought you to\r\nsave me. I will never forget him!”\r\n\r\n“It is settled,” said Smith. “We will begin our search as soon as\r\npossible. We will leave no part of the island unexplored. We will pry\r\ninto its most secret recesses, and may our unknown friend pardon our\r\nzeal!”\r\n\r\nFor several days the colonists were actively at work haymaking and\r\nharvesting. Before starting upon their exploring tour, they wanted to\r\nfinish all their important labors. Now, too, was the time for gathering\r\nthe vegetable products of Tabor Island. Everything had to be stored;\r\nand, happily, there was plenty of room in Granite House for all the\r\nriches of the island. There all was ranged in order, safe from man or\r\nbeast. No dampness was to be feared in the midst of this solid mass of\r\ngranite. Many of the natural excavations in the upper corridor were\r\nenlarged by the pick, or blown out by mining, and Granite House thus\r\nbecame a receptacle for all the goods of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe brig’s guns were pretty pieces of cast-steel, which, at Pencroff’s\r\ninstance, were hoisted, by means of tackle and cranes, to the very\r\nentrance of Granite House; embrasures were constructed between the\r\nwindows, and soon they could be seen stretching their shining nozzles\r\nthrough the granite wall. From this height these fire-breathing gentry\r\nhad the range of all Union Bay. It was a little Gibraltar, to whose\r\nfire every ship off the islet would inevitably be exposed.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff one day—it was the 8th of November—“now that\r\nwe have mounted our guns, we ought to try their range.”\r\n\r\n“For what purpose?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we ought to know how far we can send a ball.”\r\n\r\n“Try, then, Pencroff,” answered the engineer; “but don’t use our\r\npowder, whose stock I do not want to diminish; use pyroxyline, whose\r\nsupply will never fail.”\r\n\r\n“Can these cannon support the explosive force of pyroxyline?” asked the\r\nreporter, who was as eager as Pencroff to try their new artillery.\r\n\r\n“I think so. Besides,” added the engineer, “we will be careful.”\r\n\r\nSmith had good reason to think that these cannon were well made. They\r\nwere of cast steel, and breech-loaders, they could evidently bear a\r\nheavy charge, and consequently would have a long range, on account of\r\nthe tremendous initial velocity.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Smith, “the initial velocity being a question of the amount\r\nof powder in the charge, everything depends upon the resisting power of\r\nthe metal; and steel is undeniably the best metal in this respect; so\r\nthat I have great hope of our battery.”\r\n\r\nThe four cannon were in perfect condition. Ever since they had been\r\ntaken out of the water, Pencroff had made it his business to give them\r\na polish. How many hours had been spent in rubbing them, oiling them,\r\nand cleaning the separate parts! By this time they shone as if they had\r\nbeen on board of a United States frigate.\r\n\r\nThat very day, in the presence of all the colony, including Jup and\r\nTop, the new guns were successively tried. They were charged with\r\npyroxyline, which, as we have said, has an explosive force fourfold\r\nthat of gunpowder; the projectile was cylindro-conical in shape.\r\nPencroff, holding the fuse, stood ready to touch them off.\r\n\r\nUpon a word from Smith, the shot was fired. The ball, directed seaward,\r\npassed over the islet and was lost in the offing, at a distance which\r\ncould not be computed.\r\n\r\nThe second cannon was trained upon the rocks terminating Jetsam Point,\r\nand the projectile, striking a sharp boulder nearly three miles from\r\nGranite House, made it fly into shivers. Herbert had aimed and fired\r\nthe shot, and was quite proud of his success. But Pencroff was prouder\r\nof it even than he. Such a feather in his boy’s cap!\r\n\r\nThe third projectile, aimed at the downs which formed the upper coast\r\nof Union Bay, struck the sand about four miles away, then ricocheted\r\ninto the water. The fourth piece was charged heavily to test its\r\nextreme range, and every one got out of the way for fear it would\r\nburst; then the fuse was touched off by means of a long string. There\r\nwas a deafening report, but the gun stood the charge, and the\r\ncolonists, rushing to the windows, could see the projectile graze the\r\nrocks of Mandible Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and\r\ndisappear in Shark Gulf.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff, who had cheered at every shot, “what\r\ndo you say to our battery? I should like to see a pirate land now!”\r\n\r\n“Better have them stay away, Pencroff,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Speaking of that,” said the sailor, “what are we going to do with the\r\nsix rascals who are prowling about the island? Shall we let them roam\r\nabout unmolested? They are wild beasts, and I think we should treat\r\nthem as such. What do you think about it, Ayrton?” added Pencroff,\r\nturning towards his companion.\r\n\r\nAyrton hesitated for a moment, while Smith regretted the abrupt\r\nquestion, and was sincerely touched when Ayrton answered humbly:—\r\n\r\n“I was one of these wild beasts once, Mr. Pencroff, and I am not worthy\r\nto give counsel.”\r\n\r\nAnd, with bent head, he walked slowly away. Pencroff understood him.\r\n\r\n“Stupid ass that I am!” cried he. “Poor Ayrton! and yet he has as good\r\na right to speak as any of us. I would rather have bitten off my tongue\r\nthan have given him pain! But, to go back to the subject, I think these\r\nwretches have no claim to mercy, and that we should rid the island of\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“And before we hunt them down, Pencroff, shall we not wait for some\r\nfresh act of hostility?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t they done enough already?” said the sailor, who could not\r\nunderstand these refinements.\r\n\r\n“They may repent,” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“They repent!” cried the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Think of Ayrton, Pencroff!” said Herbert, taking his hand. “He has\r\nbecome an honest man.”\r\n\r\nPencroff looked at his companions In stupefaction. He could not admit\r\nthe possibility of making terms with the accomplices of Harvey, the\r\nmurderers of the Speedy’s crew.\r\n\r\n“Be it so!” he said. “You want to be magnanimous to these rascals. May\r\nwe never repent of it!”\r\n\r\n“What danger do we run if we are on our guard?” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said the reporter, doubtfully. “There are six of them, well\r\narmed. If each of them sighted one of us from behind a tree—”\r\n\r\n“Why haven’t they tried it already?” said Herbert. “Evidently it was\r\nnot their cue.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then,” said the sailor, who was stubborn in his opinion,\r\n“we will let these worthy fellows attend to their innocent occupations\r\nwithout troubling our heads about them.”\r\n\r\n“Pencroff,” said the engineer, “you have often shown respect for my\r\nopinions. Will you trust me once again?”\r\n\r\n“I will do whatever you say, Mr. Smith,” said the sailor, nowise\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\n“Well, let us wait, and not be the first to attack.”\r\n\r\nThis was the final decision, with Pencroff in the minority. They would\r\ngive the pirates a chance, which their own interest might induce them\r\nto seize upon, to come to terms. So much, humanity required of them.\r\nBut they would have to be constantly on their guard, and the situation\r\nwas a very serious one. They had silenced Pencroff, but, perhaps, after\r\nall, his advice would prove sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROJECTED EXPEDITION—AYRTON AT THE CORRAL—VISIT TO PORT\r\nBALLOON—PENCROFF’S REMARKS—DESPATCH SENT TO THE CORRAL—NO ANSWER FROM\r\nAYRTON—SETTING OUT NEXT DAY—WHY THE WIRE DID NOT ACT—A DETONATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the thing uppermost in the colonists’ thought was to achieve\r\nthe complete exploration of the island which had been decided upon, an\r\nexploration which now would have two objects: —First, to discover the\r\nmysterious being whose existence was no longer a matter of doubt; and,\r\nat the same time to find out what had become of the pirates, what\r\nhiding place they had chosen, what sort of life they were leading, and\r\nwhat was to be feared from them.\r\n\r\nSmith would have set off at once, but as the expedition would take\r\nseveral days, it seemed better to load the wagon with all the\r\nnecessaries for camping out. Now at this time one of the onagers,\r\nwounded in the leg, could not bear harness; it must have several days’\r\nrest, and they thought it would make little difference if they delayed\r\nthe departure a week, that is, till November 20. November in this\r\nlatitude corresponds to the May of the Northern Hemisphere, and the\r\nweather was fine. They were now at the longest days in the year, so\r\nthat everything was favorable to the projected expedition, which, if it\r\ndid not attain its principal object, might be fruitful in discoveries,\r\nespecially of the products of the soil; for Smith intended to explore\r\nthose thick forests of the Far West, which stretched to the end of\r\nSerpentine Peninsula.\r\n\r\nDuring the nine days which would precede their setting out, it was\r\nagreed that they should finish work on Prospect Plateau. But Ayrton had\r\nto go back to the corral to take care of their domesticated animals. It\r\nwas settled that he should stay there two days, and leave the beasts\r\nwith plenty of fodder. Just as he was setting out, Smith asked him if\r\nhe would like to have one of them with him, as the island was no longer\r\nsecure. Ayrton replied that it would be useless, as he could do\r\neverything by himself, and that there was no danger to fear. If\r\nanything happened at or near the corral, he would instantly acquaint\r\nthe colonists of it by a telegram sent to Granite House.\r\n\r\nSo Ayrton drove off in the twilight, about 9 o’clock, behind one\r\nonager, and two hours afterwards the electric wire gave notice that he\r\nhad found everything in order at the corral.\r\n\r\nDuring these two days Smith was busy at a project which would finally\r\nsecure Granite House from a surprise. The point was to hide completely\r\nthe upper orifice of the former weir, which had been already blocked up\r\nwith stones, and half hidden under grass and plants, at the southern\r\nangle of Lake Grant. Nothing could be easier, since by raising the\r\nlevel of the lake two or three feet, the hole would be entirely under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNow to raise the level, they had only to make a dam across the two\r\ntrenches by which Glycerine Creek and Waterfall Creek were fed. The\r\ncolonists were incited to the task, and the two dams, which were only\r\nseven or eight feet long, by three feet high, were rapidly erected of\r\nclosely cemented stones. When the work had been done, no one could have\r\nsuspected the existence of the subterranean conduit. The little stream\r\nwhich served to feed the reservoir at Granite House, and to work the\r\nelevator, had been suffered to flow in its channel, so that water might\r\nnever be wanting. The elevator once raised, they might defy attack.\r\n\r\nThis work had been quickly finished, and Pencroff, Spilett, and Herbert\r\nfound time for an expedition to Port Balloon. The sailor was anxious to\r\nknow whether the little inlet up which the Good Luck was moored had\r\nbeen visited by the convicts.\r\n\r\n“These gentry got to land on the southern shore,” he observed, “and if\r\nthey followed the line of the coast they may have discovered the little\r\nharbor, in which case I wouldn’t give half a dollar for our Good Luck.”\r\n\r\nSo off the three went in the afternoon of November 10. They were well\r\narmed, and as Pencroff slipped two bullets into each barrel of his gun,\r\nhe had a look which presaged no good to whoever came too near, “beast\r\nor man,” as he said. Neb went with them to the elbow of the Mercy, and\r\nlifted the bridge after them. It was agreed that they should give\r\nnotice of their return by firing a shot, when Neb would come back to\r\nput down the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe little band walked straight for the south coast. The distance was\r\nonly three miles and a half, but they took two hours to walk it. They\r\nsearched on both sides of the way, both the forest and Tadorn’s Fens;\r\nbut they found no trace of the fugitives. Arriving at Port Balloon,\r\nthey saw with great satisfaction that the Good Luck was quietly moored\r\nin the narrow inlet, which was so well hidden by the rocks that it\r\ncould be seen neither from sea nor shore, but only from directly above\r\nor below.\r\n\r\n“After all,” said Pencroff, “the rascals haven’t been here. The vipers\r\nlike tall grass better, and we shall find them in the Far-West.”\r\n\r\n“And it’s a fortunate thing,” added Herbert, “for if they had found the\r\nGood Luck, they would have made use of her in getting away, and we\r\ncould never have gone back to Tabor Island.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the reporter, “it will be important to put a paper there\r\nstating the situation of Lincoln Island, Ayrton’s new residence, in\r\ncase the Scotch yacht should come after him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, here is our Good Luck, Mr. Spilett,” said the sailor, “ready to\r\nstart with her crew at the first signal!”\r\n\r\nTalking thus, they got on board and walked about the deck. On a sudden\r\nthe sailor, after examining the bit around which the cable of the\r\nanchor was wound, cried,\r\n\r\n“Hallo! this is a bad business!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Pencroff?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“The matter is that that knot was never tied by me——”\r\n\r\nAnd Pencroff pointed to a rope which made the cable fast to the bit, so\r\nas to prevent its tripping.\r\n\r\n“How, never tied by you?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No, I can swear to it. I never tie a knot like that.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, Pencroff.”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not mistaken,” insisted the sailor. “That knot of mine is\r\nsecond nature with me.”\r\n\r\n“Then have the convicts been on board?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Pencroff, “but somebody has certainly raised and\r\ndropped this anchor!”\r\n\r\nThe sailor was so positive that neither Spilett nor Herbert could\r\ncontest his assertion. It was evident that the beat had shifted place\r\nmore or less since Pencroff had brought it back to Balloon Harbor. As\r\nfor the sailor, he had no doubt that the anchor had been pulled up and\r\ncast again. Now, why had these manœuvres taken place unless the boat\r\nhad been used on some expedition?\r\n\r\n“Then why did we not see the Good Luck pass the offing?” said the\r\nreporter, who wanted to raise every possible objection.\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Spilett,” answered the sailor, “they could have set out in\r\nthe night with a good wind, and in two hours have been out of sight of\r\nthe island.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed,” said Spilett, but I still ask with what object the convicts\r\nused the Good Luck, and why, after using her, they brought her back to\r\nport?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Spilett,” said the sailor, “we will have to include that\r\namong our mysterious incidents, and think no more of it. One thing is\r\ncertain, the Good Luck was there, and is here! If the convicts take it\r\na second time, it may never find its way back again.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Pencroff,” said Herbert, “perhaps we had better take the Good\r\nLuck back and anchor her in front of Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“I can hardly say,” answered the sailor, “but I think not. The mouth of\r\nthe Mercy is a bad place for a ship; the sea is very heavy there.”\r\n\r\n“But by hauling it over the sand to the foot of the Chimneys——”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps,” answered Pencroff. “In any case, as we have to leave\r\nGranite House for a long expedition, I believe the Good Luck will be\r\nsafer here during oar absence, and he will do well to leave her here\r\nuntil the island is rid of these rascals.”\r\n\r\n“That is my opinion, too,” said the reporter. At least in case of bad\r\nweather, she will not be exposed as she would be at the mouth of the\r\nMercy.”\r\n\r\n“But if the convicts should pay her another visit?” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy,” said Pencroff, “if they do not find the boat here they\r\nwill search until they do find her; and in our absence there is nothing\r\nto prevent their carrying her off from the front of Granite House. I\r\nagree with Mr. Spilett that we had better leave her at Balloon Harbor;\r\nbut if we have not rid the island of these wretches by the time we come\r\nback it will be more prudent to take our ship back to Granite House,\r\nuntil we have nothing more to fear from our enemies.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Spilett. “Let us go back now.”\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to Granite House, they told Smith what had happened,\r\nand the latter approved their present and future plans. He even\r\npromised Pencroff he would examine that part of the channel situated\r\nbetween the island and the coast, so as to see if it would be possible\r\nto make an artificial harbor by means of a dam. In this way the Good\r\nLuck would be always within reach, in sight of the colonists, and\r\nlocked up if necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the same evening they sent a telegram to Ayrton, asking him to bring\r\nback from the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize\r\non the plateau. Strange to say, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt\r\nof this despatch, as was his custom to do. This surprised the engineer,\r\nbut he concluded that Ayrton was not at the corral at the moment, and\r\nperhaps had started on his way back to Granite House. In fact, two days\r\nhad elapsed since his departure; and it had been agreed that on the\r\nevening of the 10th or the morning of the 11th, at latest, he would\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were now waiting to see Ayrton on Prospect Plateau. Neb\r\nand Herbert both looked after the approach by way of the bridge, so as\r\nto let it down when their companion should appear, but when 6 o’clock\r\nin the evening came, and there was no sign of Ayrton, they agreed to\r\nsend another despatch, asking for an immediate answer.\r\n\r\nThe wire at Granite House remained silent.\r\n\r\nThe uneasiness of the colonists was now extreme. What had happened?\r\n“Was Ayrton not at the corral? or, if there, had he not power over his\r\nown movements? Ought they to go in search of him on this dark night?\r\n\r\nThey discussed the point. Some were for going, and others for waiting.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Herbert, “perhaps some accident has happened to the wires\r\nwhich prevents their working.”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Let us wait until to-morrow,” said Smith. “It is just possible that\r\neither Ayrton has not received our despatch, or we have missed his.”\r\n\r\nThey waited, as may be imagined, with much anxiety. At daylight on the\r\n11th of November, Smith sent a message across the wires, but received\r\nno answer. Again, with the same result.\r\n\r\n“Let us set off at once for the corral,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Aid will armed,” added Pencroff.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that Granite House must not be deserted, so Neb was left\r\nbehind to take charge. After accompanying his companions to Glycerine\r\nCreek, he put up the bridge again, and hid behind a tree, to wait\r\neither for their return or for that of Ayrton. In case the pirates\r\nshould appear, and should attempt to force the passage, he would try to\r\ndefend it with his gun; and in the last resort he would take refuge in\r\nGranite House, where, the elevator once drawn up, he would be in\r\nperfect safety. The others were to go direct to the corral, and failing\r\nto find Ayrton there, were to scour the neighboring woods.\r\n\r\nAt 6 o’clock in the morning the engineer and his three companions had\r\ncrossed Glycerine Creek, and Neb posted himself behind a low cliff,\r\ncrowned by some large dragon trees on the left side of the brook. The\r\ncolonists, after leaving Prospect Plateau, took the direct route to the\r\ncorral. They carried their guns on their shoulders, ready to fire at\r\nthe first sign of hostility. The two rifles and the two guns had been\r\ncarefully loaded.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the path was a dense thicket, which might easily hide\r\nenemies, who, as they were armed, would be indeed formidable. The\r\ncolonists walked on rapidly without a word. Top preceded them,\r\nsometimes keeping to the path, and sometimes making a detour into the\r\nwood, but not appearing to suspect anything unusual; and they might\r\ndepend upon it that the faithful dog would not be taken by surprise,\r\nand would bark at the slightest appearance of danger.\r\n\r\nAlong this same path Smith and his companions followed the telegraphic\r\nwires which connected the corral with Granite House. For the first two\r\nmiles they did not notice any solution of continuity. The posts were in\r\ngood condition, the insulators uninjured, and the wire evenly\r\nstretched. From this point the engineer noticed that the tension was\r\nless complete, and at last, arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was\r\nahead of the others, cried, “The wire is broken!”\r\n\r\nHis companions hastened forward and arrived at the spot where the boy\r\nhad stopped. There the overturned post was lying across the path. They\r\nhad discovered the break, and it was evident that the dispatches from\r\nGranite House could not have been received at the corral.\r\n\r\n“It can’t be the wind that has overturned this post,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the reporter, “there are marks of footsteps on the\r\nground; it has been uprooted by the hand of man.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, the wire is broken,” added Herbert, showing the two ends of\r\nthe wire which had been violently torn asunder.\r\n\r\n“Is the break a fresh one?” asked Smith.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Herbert, “it was certainly made a very short time ago.”\r\n\r\n“To the corral! to the corral!” cried the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were then midway between Granite House and the corral,\r\nand had still two miles and a half to go. They started on a run.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they might well fear that something had happened at the\r\ncorral. Ayrton doubtless might have sent a telegram which had not\r\narrived. It was not this which alarmed his companions, but a\r\ncircumstance more remarkable. Ayrton, who had promised to come back the\r\nevening before, had not reappeared! The communication, between Granite\r\nHouse and the corral had been out with a sinister design.\r\n\r\nThey hurried on, their hearts beating quick with fear for their\r\ncomrade, to whom they were sincerely attached; Were they to find him\r\nstruck down by the hand of those he had formerly led?\r\n\r\nSoon they reached the place where the road lay along by the little\r\nbrook flowing from Red Creek, which watered the meadows of the corral.\r\nThey had moderated their pace, so as not to be out of breath at the\r\nmoment when a deadly struggle might occur. Their guns were uncocked,\r\nbut loaded. Each of them watched one side of the woods. Top kept up an\r\nill-omened growling.\r\n\r\nAt last the fenced enclosure appeared behind the trees. They saw no\r\nsigns of devastation. The door was closed as usual; a profound silence\r\nreigned at the corral. Neither the accustomed bleatings of the sheep\r\nnor the voice of Ayrton was to be heard.\r\n\r\n“Let us go in,” said Smith, and the engineer advanced, while his\r\ncompanions, keeping guard twenty feet in the rear, stood ready to fire.\r\n\r\nSmith raised the inner latch, and began to push back the door, when Top\r\nbarked loudly. There was a report from behind the fence, followed by a\r\ncry of pain, and Herbert, pierced by a bullet, fell to the ground!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPORTER AND PENCROFF IN THE CORRAL—MOVING HERBERT—DESPAIR OF THE\r\nSAILOR—CONSULTATION OF THE ENGINEER AND THE REPORTER—MODE OF\r\nTREATMENT—A GLIMMER OF HOPE—HOW TO WARN NEB—A FAITHFUL MESSENGER—NEB’S\r\nREPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Herbert’s cry, Pencroff, dropping his gun, sprang towards him.\r\n\r\n“They have killed him!” cried he. “My boy—they have killed him.”\r\n\r\nSmith and Spilett rushed forward. The reporter put his ear to the boy’s\r\nheart to see if it were still beating.\r\n\r\n“He’s alive,” said he, “but he must be taken—”\r\n\r\n“To Granite House? Impossible!” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“To the corral, then,” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“One moment,” said Smith, and he rushed to the left around the fence.\r\nThere he found himself face to face with a convict, who fired at him\r\nand sent a ball through his cap. An instant later, before he had time\r\nto fire again, he fell, struck to the heart by Smith’s poniard, a surer\r\nweapon even than his gun.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, the reporter and Pencroff hoisted themselves\r\nup to the angle of the fence, strode over the top, jumped into the\r\nenclosure, made their way into the empty house, and laid Herbert gently\r\ndown on Ayrton’s bed.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards Smith was at his side. At the sight of\r\nHerbert, pale and unconscious, the grief of the sailor was intense. He\r\nsobbed and cried bitterly; neither the engineer nor the reporter could\r\ncalm him. Themselves over whelmed with emotion, they could hardly\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThey did all in their power to save the poor boy’s life. Spilett, in\r\nhis life of varied experience, had acquired some knowledge of medicine.\r\nHe knew a little of everything; and had had several opportunities of\r\nlearning the surgery of gunshot wounds. With Smith’s assistance, he\r\nhastened to apply the remedies which Herbert’s condition demanded.\r\n\r\nThe boy lay in a complete stupor, caused either by the hemorrhage or by\r\nconcussion of the brain. He was very pale, and his pulse beat only at\r\nlong intervals, as if every moment about to stop. This, taken in\r\nconjunction with his utter loss of consciousness, was a grave symptom.\r\nThey stripped his chest, and, staunching the blood by means of\r\nhandkerchiefs, kept bathing the wounds in cold water.\r\n\r\nThe ball had entered between the third and fourth rib, and there they\r\nfound the wound. Smith and Spilett turned the poor boy over. At this he\r\nuttered a moan so faint that they feared it was his last breath. There\r\nwas another wound on his back, for the bullet had gone clean through.\r\n\r\n“Thank Heaven!” said the reporter, “the ball is not in his body; we\r\nshall not have to extract it.”\r\n\r\n“But the heart?” asked Smith.\r\n\r\n“The heart has not been touched, or he would be dead.”\r\n\r\n“Dead!” cried Pencroff, with a groan. He had only heard the reporter’s\r\nlast word.\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff,” answered Smith. “No he is not dead; his pulse still\r\nbeats; he has even uttered a groan. For his sake, now, you must be\r\ncalm. We have need of all our self-possession; you must not be the\r\nmeans of our losing it, my friend.”\r\n\r\nPencroff was silent, but large tears rolled down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Spilett tried to recall to memory the proper treatment of\r\nthe case before him. There seemed no doubt that the ball had entered in\r\nfront and gone out by the back; but what injuries had it done by the\r\nway? Had it reached any vital spot? This was a question which even a\r\nprofessional surgeon could not have answered at once.\r\n\r\nThere was something, however, which Spilett knew must be done, and that\r\nwas to keep down the inflammation, and to fight against the fever which\r\nensues upon a wound. The wound must be dressed without delay. It was\r\nnot necessary to bring on a fresh flow of blood by the use of tepid\r\nwater and compresses, for Herbert was already too weak. The wounds,\r\ntherefore, were bathed with cold water.\r\n\r\nHerbert was placed upon his left side and held in that position.\r\n\r\n“He must not be moved,” said Spilett; “he is in the position most\r\nfavorable to an easy suppuration, and absolute repose is necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Cannot we take him to Granite House?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\nSpilett was examining the boy’s wounds again with close attention.\r\nHerbert was so frightfully pale that he became alarmed.\r\n\r\n“Cyrus,” said he, “I am no doctor. I am in a terrible strait; you must\r\nhelp me with your advice and assistance.”\r\n\r\n“Calm yourself, my friend,” answered the engineer, pressing his hand.\r\n“Try to judge coolly. Think only of saving Herbert.”\r\n\r\nSpilett’s self-possession, which in a moment of discouragement his keen\r\nsense of responsibility had caused him to lose, returned again at these\r\nwords. He seated himself upon the bed; Smith remained standing,\r\nPencroff had torn up his shirt and began mechanically to make lint.\r\n\r\nSpilett explained that the first thing to do was to check the\r\nhemorrhage, but not to close the wounds or bring on immediate\r\ncicatrization—for there had been internal perforation, and they must\r\nnot let the suppurated matter collect within. It was decided therefore\r\nto dress the two wounds, but not to press them together. The colonists\r\npossessed a most powerful agent for quelling inflamation, and one which\r\nnature supplies in the greatest abundance; to-wit, cold water, which is\r\nnow used by all doctors. It has, moreover, the advantage of allowing\r\nthe wound perfect rest, and dispensing with the frequent dressing,\r\nwhich by exposing the wound to the air in the early stages, is so often\r\nattended with lamentable results.\r\n\r\nThus did Smith and Spilett reason, with clear, native good sense, and\r\nacted as the best surgeon would have done. The wounds were bandaged\r\nwith linen and constantly soaked with fresh water. The sailor had\r\nlighted a fire in the chimney, and the house fortunately contained all\r\nthe necessaries of life. They had maple-sugar and the medicinal plants\r\nwhich the boy had gathered on the shores of Lake Grant. From these they\r\nmade a refreshing drink for the sick boy. His fever was very high, and\r\nhe lay all that day and night without a sign of consciousness. His life\r\nwas hanging on a thread.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, November 12, they began to have some hopes of his\r\nrecovery. His consciousness returned, he opened his eyes and recognized\r\nthem all. He even said two or three words, and wanted to know what had\r\nhappened. Spilett told him, and begged him to keep perfectly quiet;\r\nthat his life was not in danger, and his wounds would heal in a few\r\ndays. Herbert suffered very little, for the inflammation was\r\nsuccessfully kept down by the plentiful use of cold water. A regular\r\nsuppuration had set in, the fever did not increase, and they began to\r\nhope that this terrible accident would not end in a worse catastrophe.\r\n\r\nPencroff took heart again; he was the best of nurses, like a Sister of\r\nCharity, or a tender mother watching over her child. Herbert had fallen\r\ninto another stupor, but this time the sleep appeared more natural.\r\n\r\n“Tell me again that you have hope, Mr. Spilett,” said Pencroff; “tell\r\nme again that you will save my boy!”\r\n\r\n“We shall save him,” said the reporter. “The wound is a serious one,\r\nand perhaps the ball has touched the lung; but a wound in that organ is\r\nnot mortal.”\r\n\r\n“May God grant it!” answered the sailor.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined, the care of Herbert had occupied all their time and\r\nthoughts for the first twenty-four hours at the corral. They had not\r\nconsidered the urgent danger of a return of the convicts, nor taken any\r\nprecautions for the future. But on this day while Pencroff was watching\r\nover the invalid, Smith and the reporter took counsel together as to\r\ntheir plans.\r\n\r\nThey first searched the corral. There was no trace of Ayrton, and it\r\nseemed probable that he had resisted his former companions, and fallen\r\nby their hands. The corral had not been pillaged, and as its gates had\r\nremained shut, the domestic animals had not been able to wander away\r\ninto the woods. They could see no traces of the pirates either in the\r\ndwelling or the palisade. The only thing gone was the stock of\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\n“The poor fellow was taken by surprise,” said Smith, “and as he was a\r\nman to show fight, no doubt they made an end of him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the reporter, “and then, no doubt, they took possession\r\nhere, where they found everything in great plenty, and took to flight\r\nonly when they saw us coming.”\r\n\r\n“We must beat the woods,” said the engineer, and rid the island of\r\nthese wretches. But we will have to wait some time in the corral, till\r\nthe day comes when we can safely carry Herbert to Granite House.”\r\n\r\n“But Neb?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Neb’s safe enough.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose he becomes anxious and risks coming here?”\r\n\r\n“He must not come,” said Smith sharply. “He would be murdered on the\r\nway!”\r\n\r\n“It’s very likely he will try.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! if the telegraph was only in working order, we could warn him! But\r\nnow it’s impossible. We can’t leave Pencroff and Herbert here alone.\r\nWell, I’ll go by myself to Granite House!”\r\n\r\n“No, no, Cyrus,” said the reporter, “you must not expose yourself.\r\nThese wretches are watching the corral from their ambush, and there\r\nwould be two mishaps instead of one!”\r\n\r\n“But Neb has been without news of us for twenty-four hours,” repeated\r\nthe engineer. “He will want to come.”\r\n\r\nWhile he reflected, his gaze fell upon Top, who, by running to and fro,\r\nseemed to say, “Have you forgotten me?”\r\n\r\n“Top!” cried Smith.\r\n\r\nThe dog sprang up at this master’s call.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Top shall go!” cried the reporter, who understood in a flash. Top\r\nwill make his way where we could not pass, will take our message and\r\nbring us back an answer.”\r\n\r\n“Quick!” said Smith, “quick!”\r\n\r\nSpilett tore out a page of his note-book and wrote these lines:—\r\n\r\n“Herbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave\r\nGranite House. Have the convicts shown themselves near you? Answer by\r\nTop!”\r\n\r\nThis laconic note was folded and tied in a conspicuous way to Top’s\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n“Top, my dog,” said the engineer, caressing the animal, “Neb, Top, Neb!\r\nAway! away!”\r\n\r\nTop sprang high at the words. He understood what was wanted, and the\r\nroad was familiar to him. The engineer went to the door of the corral\r\nand opened one of the leaves.\r\n\r\n“Neb, Top, Neb!” he cried again, pointing towards Granite House.\r\n\r\nTop rushed out and disappeared almost instantly.\r\n\r\n“He’ll get there!” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and come back, the faithful brute!”\r\n\r\n“What time is it?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“In an hour he may be here. We will watch for him.\r\n\r\nThe door of the corral was closed again. The engineer and the reporter\r\nre-entered the house. Herbert lay in a profound sleep. Pencroff kept\r\nhis compresses constantly wet with cold water. Spilett, seeing that\r\njust then there was nothing else to do, set to work to prepare some\r\nfood, all the time keeping his eye on that part of the inclosure which\r\nbacked up against the spur, from which an attack might be made.\r\n\r\nThe colonists awaited Top’s return with much anxiety. A little before\r\n11 o’clock Smith andSpilett stood with their carbines behind the door,\r\nready to open it at the dog’s first bark. They knew that if Top got\r\nsafely to Granite House, Neb would send him back at once.\r\n\r\nThey had waited about ten minutes, when they heard a loud report,\r\nfollowed instantly by continuous barking. The engineer opened the door,\r\nand, seeing smoke still curling up among the trees a hundred paces off,\r\nhe fired in that direction. Just then Top bounded into the corral,\r\nwhose door was quickly shut.\r\n\r\n“Top, Top!” cried the engineer, caressing the dog’s large, noble head.\r\nA note was fastened to his collar, containing these words in Neb’s\r\nsprawling handwriting:——\r\n\r\n“No pirates near Granite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr. Herbert!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONVICTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CORRAL—PROVISIONAL\r\nOCCUPATION—CONTINUATION OF HERBERT’S TREATMENT—PENCROFF’S\r\nJUBILATION—REVIEW OF THE PAST—FUTURE PROSPECTS—SMITH’S IDEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, then, the convicts were close by, watching the corral, and waiting\r\nto kill the colonists one after another. They must be attacked like\r\nwild beasts, but with the greatest precaution, for the wretches had the\r\nadvantage of position, seeing and not being seen, able to make a sudden\r\nattack, yet not themselves to be surprised.\r\n\r\nSo Smith made his arrangements to live at the corral, which was fully\r\nprovisioned. Ayrton’s house was furnished with all the necessaries of\r\nlife, and the convicts, frightened away by the colonists’ arrival, had\r\nnot had time to pillage. It was most likely, as Spilett suggested, that\r\nthe course of events had been this:—The convicts had followed the\r\nsouthern coast, and after getting over into Serpentine Peninsula, and\r\nbeing in no humor to risk themselves in the woods of the Far West, they\r\nhad reached the month of Fall River. Then, walking up the right bank of\r\nthe stream, they had come to the spur of Mount Franklin; here was their\r\nmost natural place of refuge. And they had soon discovered the corral.\r\nThey had probably installed themselves there, had been surprised by\r\nAyrton, had overcome the unfortunate man, and—the rest was easily\r\ndivined!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the convicts, reduced to five, but well armed, were prowling\r\nin the woods, and to pursue them was to be exposed to their fire\r\nwithout the power either of avoiding or of anticipating them.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing else to do but wait,” repeated Smith. “When Herbert\r\nis well again, we will beat the island, and have a shot at these\r\nrascals; while at the same time——”\r\n\r\n“We search for our mysterious protector,” added Spilett, finishing the\r\nsentence. “Ah! we must confess, dear Cyrus, that, for once, his\r\nprotection has failed us.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t know about that,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“We are not at the end of our troubles, my dear Spilett, and his\r\npowerful interference may still be exercised. But now we must think of\r\nHerbert.”\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed, and the poor boy’s condition was happily no worse;\r\nand to gain time was a great thing. The cold water, always kept at the\r\nproper temperature, had absolutely prevented the inflammation of the\r\nwounds. Nay, it seemed to the reporter that this water, which contained\r\na little sulphur, due to the neighborhood of the volcano, had a direct\r\ntendency towards cicatrization. The suppuration was much less copious,\r\nand, thanks to excellent nursing, Herbert had returned to\r\nconsciousness, and his fever had abated. He was, moreover, strictly\r\ndieted, and, of course, was very weak; but he had plenty of broths and\r\ngruels, and absolute rest was doing him great good.\r\n\r\nSmith, Spilett, and Pencroff had become very skilful in tending him.\r\nAll the linen in the house had been sacrificed. The wounded parts,\r\ncovered with lint and compresses, were subjected to just enough\r\npressure to cicatrize them without bringing on a reaction of\r\ninflammation. The reporter dressed the wounds with the greatest care,\r\nrepeating to his companions the medical axiom that good dressing is as\r\nrare as a good operation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten days, by the 22d of November, Herbert was decidedly\r\nbetter. He had begun to take some nourishment. The color came back to\r\nhis cheeks, and he smiled at his nurse. He talked a little, in spite of\r\nPencroff, who chattered away all the time to keep the boy from saying a\r\nword, and told the most remarkable stories. Herbert inquired about\r\nAyrton, and was surprised not to see him at the bedside; but the\r\nsailor, who would not distress his patient, answered merely that Ayrton\r\nhad gone to be with Neb at Granite House in case the convicts attacked\r\nit. “Nice fellows they are,” said he. “To think that Mr. Smith wanted\r\nto appeal to their feelings! I’ll send them my compliments in a good\r\nheavy bullet!”\r\n\r\n“And nobody has seen them?” asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n“No, my boy,” answered the sailor, “but we will find them, and when you\r\nare well we shall see whether these cowards, who strike from behind,\r\nwill dare to meet us face to face.”\r\n\r\n“I am still very weak, dear Pencroff.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! your strength will come back little by little. What’s a ball\r\nthrough the chest? Nothing to speak of. I have seen several of them,\r\nand feel no worse for it.”\r\n\r\nIn fine, things were growing better, and it no unlucky complication\r\noccurred, Herbert’s cure might be regarded as certain. But what would\r\nhave been the colonists’ situation if the ball had remained in his\r\nbody, if his arm or leg had had to be amputated? They could not think\r\nof it without a shudder.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Smith that he and his companions, until now so fortunate,\r\nhad entered upon an ill-omened time. For the two and a half years which\r\nhad elapsed since their escape from Richmond they had succeeded in\r\neverything. But now luck seemed to be turning against them. Ayrton,\r\ndoubtless, was dead, and Herbert severely wounded; and that strange but\r\npowerful intervention, which had done them such mighty services, seemed\r\nnow to be withdrawn. Had the mysterious being abandoned the island, or\r\nhimself been overcome?\r\n\r\nThey could give no answer to these questions; but though they talked\r\ntogether about them, they were not men to despair. They looked the\r\nsituation in the face; they analyzed the chances; they prepared\r\nthemselves for every contingency; they stood firm and undaunted before\r\nthe future; and if adversity should continue to oppress them, she would\r\nfind them men prepared to do their utmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO NEWS OF NEB—A PROPOSAL FROM PENCROFF AND SPILETT—THE REPORTER’S\r\nSORTIES—A FRAGMENT OF CLOTH—A MESSAGE—HURRIED DEPARTURE—ARRIVAL AT\r\nPROSPECT PLATEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbert’s convalescence progressed steadily. Only one thing was left to\r\nwish for, to wit, that he would get well enough to be taken to Granite\r\nHouse. However well arranged and provisioned might be the dwelling in\r\nthe corral, there was nothing like the solid comfort of their abode in\r\nthe rock. Besides, they were not safe here, and, in spite of their\r\nwatchfulness, they were always in dread of a shot from the woods.\r\nWhereas there in the midst of that unassailable and inaccessible mass\r\nof rock there would be nothing to fear. They waited, therefore, with\r\nimpatience for the moment when Herbert could be carried, without danger\r\nto his wound, across the difficult route through Jacamar Woods.\r\n\r\nThough without news of Neb, they had no fear for him. The brave negro,\r\noccupying a position of such strength, would not let himself be\r\nsurprised. Top had not been sent back to him, for it seemed useless to\r\nexpose the faithful dog to some shot which might deprive the colonists\r\nof their most useful helper. The engineer regretted to see his forces\r\ndivided, and thus to play into the hands of the pirates. Since Ayrton’s\r\ndisappearance, they were only four against five, for Herbert could not\r\nbe counted. The poor boy knew and lamented the danger of which he was\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nOne day, November 29, when he was asleep, they discussed their plans of\r\naction against the convicts.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said the reporter, after they had talked over the\r\nimpossibility of communicating with Neb, “I agree with you that to risk\r\nourselves on the path leading from the corral would be a useless\r\nexposure. But why should we not beat the woods for these wretches?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I was thinking,” replied Pencroff. “We’re not afraid of a\r\nbullet, and for my part, if Mr. Smith approves, I am ready to take to\r\nthe woods. Surely one man is as good as another!”\r\n\r\n“But is he as good as five?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“I will go with Pencroff,’ answered the reporter, “and the two of us,\r\nwell armed, and Top with us—”\r\n\r\n“My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroff, let us discuss the matter coolly.\r\nIf the convicts were in hiding in some place known to us, from which we\r\ncould drive them by an attack, it would be a different affair. But have\r\nwe not every reason to fear that they will get the first shot?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” cried Pencroff, “a bullet doesn’t always hit its mark!”\r\n\r\n“That which pierced Herbert did not go astray,” answered the engineer.\r\n“Besides, remember that if you both leave the corral, I shall be left\r\nalone to defend it. Can you answer that the convicts will not see you\r\ngo off, that they will not wait till you are deep in the woods, and\r\nthen make their attack in your absence upon a man and a sick boy?”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to say in answer to this reasoning, which went home\r\nto the minds of all.\r\n\r\n“If only Ayrton was yet one of the party!” said Spilett. “Poor fellow!\r\nhis return to a life with his kind was not for long!”\r\n\r\n“If he is dead!” added Pencroff, in a peculiar tone.\r\n\r\n“Have you any hope that those rascals have spared him, Pencroff?” asked\r\nSpilett.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if their interest led them to do so.”\r\n\r\n“What! do you suppose that Ayrton, among his former companions in\r\nguilt, would forget all he owed to us—”\r\n\r\n“Nobody can tell,” answered the sailor, with some hesitation.\r\n\r\n“Pencroff,” said Smith, laying his hand on the sailor’s arm, “that was\r\nan unworthy thought. I will guarantee Ayrton’s fidelity!”\r\n\r\n“And I too,” added the reporter, decidedly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Mr. Smith, I am wrong,” answered Pencroff. “But really I am\r\na little out of my mind. This imprisonment in the corral is driving me\r\nto distraction.”\r\n\r\n“Be patient, Pencroff,” answered the engineer. “How soon, my dear\r\nSpilett, do you suppose Herbert can be carried to Granite House?”\r\n\r\n“That is hard to say, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “for a little\r\nimprudence might be fatal. But if he goes on as well as he is doing now\r\nfor another week, why then we will see.”\r\n\r\nAt that season the spring was two months advanced. The weather was\r\ngood, and the heat began to be oppressive. The woods were in fall leaf,\r\nand it was almost time to reap the accustomed harvest. It can easily be\r\nunderstood how this siege in the corral upset the plans of the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the reporter risked himself outside, and walked around\r\nthe palisade. Top was with him, and his carbine was loaded.\r\n\r\nHe met no one and saw nothing suspicious. Top would have warned him of\r\nany danger, and so long as the dog did not bark, there was nothing to\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nBut on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Spilett, who had\r\nventured into the woods for a quarter of a mile to the south of the\r\nmountain, noticed that Top smelt something. The dog’s motions were no\r\nlonger careless; he ran to and fro, ferreting about in the grass and\r\nthistles, as if his keen nose had put him on the track of an enemy.\r\n\r\nSpilett followed the dog, encouraging and exciting him by his voice;\r\nhis eye on the alert, his carbine on his shoulder, and availing himself\r\nof the shelter of the trees. It was not likely that Top had recognized\r\nthe presence of a man, for in that case he would have announced it by a\r\nhalf-stifled but angry bark. Since not even a growl was to be heard,\r\nthe danger was evidently neither near nor approaching.\r\n\r\nAbout five minutes had passed in this way, Top ferreting about and the\r\nreporter cautiously following him, when the dog suddenly rushed towards\r\na thicket and tore from it a strip of cloth. It was a piece from a\r\ngarment, dirty and torn. Spilett went back with it to the corral. There\r\nthe colonists examined it and recognized it as a piece of Ayrton’s\r\nwaistcoat, which was made of the felt prepared only in the workshop at\r\nGranite House.\r\n\r\n“You see, Pencroff,” observed Smith, “Ayrton resisted manfully, and the\r\nconvicts dragged him off in spite of his efforts. Do you still doubt\r\nhis good faith?”\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Smith,” replied the sailor; “I have long ago given up that\r\nmomentary suspicion. But I think we may draw one conclusion from this\r\nfact.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“That Ayrton was not killed at the corral. They must have dragged him\r\nout alive, and perhaps he is still alive.”\r\n\r\n“It may be so,” said the engineer, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThe most impatient of them all to get back to Granite House was\r\nHerbert. He knew how necessary it was for them all to be there, and\r\nfelt that it was he who was keeping them at the corral. The one thought\r\nwhich had taken possession of his mind was to leave the corral, and to\r\nleave it as soon as possible. He believed that he could bear the\r\njourney to Granite House. He was sure that his strength would come back\r\nto him sooner in his own room, with the sight and the smell of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was now November 29. The colonists were talking together in\r\nHerbert’s room, about 7 o’clock in the morning, when they heard Top\r\nbarking loudly. They seized their guns, always loaded and cocked, and\r\nwent out of the house.\r\n\r\nTop ran to the bottom of the palisade, jumping and barking with joy.\r\n\r\n“Some one is coming!”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And not an enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Neb, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Or Ayrton?”\r\n\r\nThese words had scarcely been exchanged between the engineer and his\r\ncomrade, when something leaped the palisade and fell on the ground\r\ninside. It was Jup. Master Jup himself, who was frantically welcomed by\r\nTop.\r\n\r\n“Neb has sent him!” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Then he must have some note on him,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\nPencroff rushed to the orang. Neb could not have chosen a better\r\nmessenger, who could get through obstacles which none of the others\r\ncould have surmounted. Smith was right. Around Jup’s neck was hung a\r\nlittle bag, and in it was a note in Neb’s handwriting. The dismay of\r\nthe colonists may be imagined when they read these words:—\r\n\r\n“FRIDAY, 6 A. M.”—The convicts are on the plateau. NEB.”\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other without saying a word, then walked back to\r\nthe house. What was there to do? The convicts on Prospect Plateau meant\r\ndisaster, devastation and ruin! Herbert knew at once from their faces\r\nthat the situation had become grave, and when he saw Jup, he had no\r\nmore doubt that misfortune was threatening Granite House.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith,” said he, “I want to go. I can bear the journey. I want to\r\nstart.”\r\n\r\nSpilett came up to Herbert and looked at him intently.\r\n\r\n“Let us start then,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe question of Herbert’s transportation was quickly decided. A litter\r\nwould be the most comfortable way of travelling, but it would\r\nnecessitate two porters; that is, two guns would be subtracted from\r\ntheir means of defense. On the other hand, by placing the mattresses on\r\nwhich Herbert lay in the wagon, so as to deaden the motion, and by\r\nwalking carefully they could escape jolting him, and would leave their\r\narms free.\r\n\r\nThe wagon was brought out and the onagga harnessed to it; Smith and the\r\nreporter lifted the mattresses with Herbert on them, and laid them in\r\nthe bottom of the wagon between the rails. The weather was fine, and\r\nthe sun shone brightly between the trees.\r\n\r\n“Are the arms ready?” asked Smith.\r\n\r\nThey were. The engineer and Pencroff, each armed with a\r\ndouble-barrelled gun, and Spilett with his carbine, stood ready to set\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“How do you feel, Herbert?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be troubled, Mr. Smith,” answered the boy, “I shall not die on\r\nthe way.”\r\n\r\nThey could see that the poor fellow was making a tremendous effort. The\r\nengineer felt a grievous pang. He hesitated to give the signal for\r\ndeparture. But to stay would have thrown Herbert into despair.\r\n\r\n“Let us start,” said Smith.\r\n\r\nThe corral door was opened. Jup and Top, who knew how to be quiet on\r\nemergency, rushed on ahead. The wagon went out, the gate was shut, and\r\nthe onagga, under Pencroff’s guidance, walked on with a slow pace.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, on account of the wagon, to keep to the direct road\r\nfrom the corral to Granite House, although it was known to the\r\nconvicts. Smith and Spilett walked on either side of the chariot, ready\r\nto meet any attack. Still it was not likely that the convicts had yet\r\nabandoned Prospect Plateau. Neb’s note had evidently been sent as soon\r\nas they made their appearance. Now this note was dated at 6 o’clock in\r\nthe morning, and the active orang, who was accustomed to the way, would\r\nhave got over the five miles from Granite House in three-quarters of an\r\nhour. Probably they would have no danger to fear till they approached\r\nGranite House.\r\n\r\nBut they kept on the alert. Top and Jup, the latter armed with his\r\nstick, sometimes in front, and sometimes beating the woods on either\r\nside, gave no signal of approaching danger. The wagon moved on slowly,\r\nand an hour after leaving the corral, they had passed over four of the\r\nfive miles without any incident.\r\n\r\nThey drew near the plateau another mile, and they saw the causeway over\r\nGlycerine Creek. At last, through an opening in the wood, they saw the\r\nhorizon of the sea. But the wagon went on slowly, and none of its\r\ndefenders could leave it for a moment. Just then Pencroff stopped the\r\nwagon and cried, fiercely,\r\n\r\n“Ah, the wretches!”\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed to a thick smoke which curled up from the mill, the\r\nstables, and the buildings of the poultry-yard. In the midst of this\r\nsmoke a man was running about. It was Neb.\r\n\r\nHis companions uttered a cry. He heard them and rushed to meet them.\r\n\r\nThe convicts had abandoned the plateau half an hour before, after\r\nhaving done all the mischief they could.\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Herbert?” cried Neb.\r\n\r\nSpilett went back to the wagon. Herbert had fainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBERT CARRIED TO GRANITE HOUSE—NEB RELATES WHAT HAD HAPPENED—VISIT OF\r\nSMITH TO THE PLATEAU—RUIN AND DEVASTATION—THE COLONISTS HELPLESS—WILLOW\r\nBARK—A MORTAL FEVER—TOP BARKS AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe convicts, the dangers threatening Granite House, the ruin on the\r\nplateau, none of these were thought of, in the present condition of\r\nHerbert. It was impossible to say whether the transportation had\r\noccasioned some internal rupture, but his companions were almost\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nThe wagon had been taken to the bend of the river, and there the\r\nmattress, on which lay the unconscious lad, was placed on a litter of\r\nbranches, and within a few minutes Herbert was lying on his bed in\r\nGranite House. He smiled for a moment on finding himself again in his\r\nchamber, and a few words escaped feebly from his lips. Spilett looked\r\nat his wounds, fearing that they might have opened, but the cicatrices\r\nwere unbroken. What, then, was the cause of this prostration, or why\r\nhad his condition grown worse?\r\n\r\nSoon the lad fell into a feverish sleep, and the reporter and Pencroff\r\nwatched beside him.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Smith told Neb of all that had happened at the corral, and\r\nNeb told his master of what had passed at the plateau.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the previous night that the convicts had shown\r\nthemselves beyond the edge of the forest, near Glycerine Creek. Neb,\r\nkeeping watch near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one\r\nof them who was crossing the bridge; but he could not say with what\r\nresult. At least, it did not disperse the band, and Neb had but just\r\ntime to climb up into Granite House, where he, at least, would be safe.\r\n\r\nBut what was the next thing to do? How prevent the threatened\r\ndevastation to the plateau? How could he inform his master? And,\r\nmoreover, in what situation were the occupants of the corral?\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions had gone away on the 11th inst., and here it\r\nwas the 29th. In that time all the information that Neb had received\r\nwas the disastrous news brought by Top. Ayrton gone, Herbert badly\r\nwounded, the engineer, the reporter, and the sailor imprisoned in the\r\ncorral.\r\n\r\nThe poor negro asked himself what was to be done. Personally, he had\r\nnothing to fear, as the convicts could not get into Granite House. But\r\nthe works, the fields, all the improvements, were at the mercy of the\r\npirates. Was it not best to let Smith know of the threatened danger?\r\n\r\nThen Neb thought of employing Jup on this errand. He knew the\r\nintelligence of the orang. Jup knew the word “corral.” It was not yet\r\ndaylight. The agile brute could slip through the woods unperceived. So\r\nthe negro wrote a note, which he fastened round Jup’s neck, and taking\r\nthe monkey to the door and unrolling a long cord, he repeated the\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\n“Jup! Jup! To the corral! the corral!”\r\n\r\nThe animal understood him, and, seizing the cord, slid down to the\r\nground, and disappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\n“You did well, Neb, although In not forewarning us perhaps you would\r\nhave done better!” said Smith, thinking of Herbert, and how the\r\ncarrying him back had been attended with such serious results.\r\n\r\nNeb finished his recital. The convicts had not shown themselves upon\r\nthe beach, doubtless fearing the inhabitants of Granite House, whose\r\nnumber they did not know. But the plateau was open and unprotected by\r\nGranite House. Here, therefore, they gave loose reins to their instinct\r\nof depredation and destruction, and they had left but half-an-hour\r\nbefore the colonists returned.\r\n\r\nNeb had rushed from his retreat, and at the risk of being shot, he had\r\nclimbed to the plateau and had tried to put out the fire which was\r\ndestroying the inclosure to the poultry-yard. Ho was engaged in this\r\nwork when the others returned.\r\n\r\nThus the presence of the convicts was a constant menace to the\r\ncolonists, heretofore so happy, and they might expect the most\r\ndisastrous results from them.\r\n\r\nSmith, accompanied by Neb, went to see for himself, the extent of the\r\ninjury done. He walked along by the Mercy and up the left bank without\r\nseeing any trace of the convicts. It was likely that the latter had\r\neither witnessed the return of the colonists, and had gone back to the\r\ncorral, now undefended, or that they had gone back to their camp to\r\nawait an occasion to renew the attack.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, all attempts to rid the island of these pests were\r\nsubject to the condition of Herbert.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and Neb reached the place. It was a scene of desolation.\r\nFields trampled; the harvest scattered; the stables and other buildings\r\nburned; the frightened animals roaming at large over the plateau. The\r\nfowls, which had sought refuge on the lake, were returning to their\r\naccustomed place on its banks. Everything here would have to be done\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding days were the saddest which the colonists had passed on\r\nthe island. Herbert became more and more feeble. He was in a sort of\r\nstupor, and symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves. Cooling\r\ndraughts were all the remedies at the disposition of the colonists.\r\nMeantime, the fever became intermittent, and it was necessary to check,\r\nit before it developed greater strength.\r\n\r\n“To do this,” said Spilett, “we must have a febrifuge.”\r\n\r\n“And we have neither cinchonia nor quinine,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“No, but we can make a substitute from the bark of the willow trees at\r\nthe lake.”\r\n\r\n“Let us try it immediately,” replied Smith.\r\n\r\nIndeed, willow bark has been partly considered succedaneous to\r\ncinchonia, but since they had no means of extracting the salicin, the\r\nbark must be used in its natural state.\r\n\r\nSmith, therefore, cut some pieces of bark from a species of black\r\nwillow, and, reducing them to powder, this powder was given to Herbert\r\nthe same evening.\r\n\r\nThe night passed without incident. Herbert was somewhat delirious, but\r\nthe fever did not manifest itself. Pencroff became more hopeful, but\r\nSpilett, who knew that the fever was intermittent, looked forward to\r\nthe next day with anxiety.\r\n\r\nThey noticed that during the apyrexy, Herbert seemed completely\r\nprostrated, his head heavy, and subject to dizziness. Another alarming\r\nsymptom was a congestion of the liver, and soon a more marked delirium\r\nmanifested itself.\r\n\r\nSpilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He drew the engineer\r\naside and said to him:——\r\n\r\n“It is a pernicious fever!”\r\n\r\n“A pernicious fever!” cried Smith. “You must be mistaken, Spilett. A\r\npernicious fever never declares itself spontaneously; it must have a\r\ngerm.”\r\n\r\n“I am not mistaken,” replied the reporter. “Herbert may have caught the\r\ngerm in the marshes. He has already had one attack; if another follows,\r\nand we cannot prevent a third—he is lost!”\r\n\r\n“But the willow bark?——”\r\n\r\n“Is insufficient. And a third attack of pernicious fever, when one\r\ncannot break it by means of quinine, is always mortal!”\r\n\r\nHappily Pencroff had not heard this conversation. It would have driven\r\nhim wild.\r\n\r\nTowards noon of the 7th, the second attack manifested itself. The\r\ncrisis was terrible. Herbert felt that he was lost! He stretched out\r\nhis arms towards Smith, towards Spilett, towards Pencroff! He did not\r\nwant to die! The scene was heartrending, and it became necessary to\r\ntake Pencroff away.\r\n\r\nThe attack lasted five hours. It was plain that the lad could not\r\nsupport a third. The night was full of torture. In his delirium,\r\nHerbert wrestled with the convicts; he called Ayrton; he supplicated\r\nthat mysterious being, that protector, who had disappeared but whose\r\nimage haunted him—then he fell into a profound prostration, and\r\nSpilett, more than once, thought the poor boy was dead!\r\n\r\nThe next day passed with only a continuation of the lad’s feebleness.\r\nHis emaciated hands clutched the bed clothing. They continued giving\r\nhim doses of the willow powder, but the reporter anticipated no result\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n“If,” said he, “before to-morrow morning we cannot give him a more\r\npowerful febrifuge than this, Herbert will die!”\r\n\r\nThe night came—doubtless the last night for this brave lad, so good, so\r\nclever, whom all loved as their own child! The sole remedy against this\r\npernicious fever, the sole specific which could vanquish it, was not to\r\nbe found on Lincoln Island!\r\n\r\nDuring the night Herbert became frightfully delirious. He recognized no\r\none. It was not even probable that he would live till morning. His\r\nstrength was exhausted. Towards 3 o’clock he uttered a frightful cry.\r\nHe was seized by a terrible convulsion. Neb, who was beside him,\r\nrushed, frightened, into the adjoining chamber, where his companions\r\nwere watching.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Top gave one of his strange barks.\r\n\r\nAll returned to the chamber and gathered round the dying lad, who\r\nstruggled to throw himself from the bed. Spilett, who held his arms,\r\nfelt his pulse slowly rising.\r\n\r\nFive o’clock came. The sun’s rays shone into the chambers of Granite\r\nHouse. A beautiful day, the last on earth for poor Herbert, dawned over\r\nLincoln Island.\r\n\r\nA sunbeam crept on to the table beside the bed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Pencroff, uttering an exclamation, pointed to something on\r\nthat table.\r\n\r\nIt was a small oblong box, bearing these words:——\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of quinine._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INEXPLICABLE MYSTERY—HERBERT’S CONVALESCENCE—THE UNEXPLORED PARTS OF\r\nTHE ISLAND—PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE—THE FIRST DAY—NIGHT—SECOND\r\nDAY—THE KAURIS—CASSOWARIES—FOOTPRINTS IN THE SAND—ARRIVAL AT REPTILE\r\nEND.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpilett took the box and opened it. It contained a white powder, which\r\nhe tasted. Its extreme bitterness was unmistakable. It was indeed that\r\nprecious alkaloid, the true anti-periodic.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to administer it to Herbert without delay. How it came\r\nthere could be discussed later.\r\n\r\nSpilett called for some coffee, and Neb brought a lukewarm infusion, in\r\nwhich the reporter placed eighteen grains of quinine and gave the\r\nmixture to Herbert to drink.\r\n\r\nThere was still time, as the third attack of the fever had not yet\r\nmanifested itself. And, indeed, it did not return. Moreover, every one\r\nbecame hopeful. The mysterious influence was again about them, and that\r\ntoo in a moment when they had despaired of its aid.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours, Herbert rested more quietly, and the colonists could\r\ntalk of the incident. The intervention of this unknown being was more\r\nevident than ever, but how had he succeeded in getting in to Granite\r\nHouse during the night? It was perfectly inexplicable, and, indeed, the\r\nmovements of this “genius of the island” were as mysterious as the\r\ngenius himself.\r\n\r\nThe quinine was administered to Herbert every three hours, and the next\r\nday the lad was certainly better. It is true he was not out of danger,\r\nsince these fevers are often followed by dangerous relapses; but, then,\r\nhere was the specific, and, doubtless, not far off, the one who had\r\nbrought it. In two days more Herbert became convalescent. He was still\r\nfeeble, but there had been no relapse, and he cheerfully submitted to\r\nthe rigorous diet imposed upon, him. He was so anxious to get well.\r\n\r\nPencroff was beside himself with joy. After the critical period had\r\nbeen safely passed he seized the reporter in his arms, and called him\r\nnothing but Doctor Spilett.\r\n\r\nBut the true physician was still to be found.\r\n\r\n““We will find him!” said the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe year 1867, during which the colonists had been so hardly beset,\r\ncame to an end, and the new year began with superb weather. A fine\r\nwarmth, a tropical temperature, moderated by the sea breeze. Herbert’s\r\nbed was drawn close to the window, where he could inhale long draughts\r\nof the salt, salubrious air. His appetite began to return, and what\r\ntempting savory morsels Neb prepared for him!\r\n\r\n“It made one wish to be ill,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the convicts had not shown themselves, neither was\r\nthere any news of Ayrton. The engineer and Herbert still hoped to get\r\nhim back, but the others thought that the unhappy man had succumbed. In\r\na month’s time, when the lad should have regained his strength, the\r\nimportant search would be undertaken, and all these questions set at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nDuring January the work on the plateau consisted simply in collecting\r\nthe grain and vegetables undestroyed in the work of devastation, and\r\nplanting some for a late crop during the next season. Smith preferred\r\nto wait till the island was rid of the convicts before he repaired the\r\ndamage to the mill, poultry-yard, and stable.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the month Herbert began to take some exercise. He\r\nwas eighteen years old, his constitution was splendid, and from this\r\nmoment the improvement in his condition was visible daily.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the month he walked on the shore and over the plateau,\r\nand strengthened himself with sea-baths. Smith felt that the day for\r\nthe exploration could be set, and the 15th of February was chosen. The\r\nnights at this season were very clear, and would, therefore, be\r\nadvantageous to the search.\r\n\r\nThe necessary preparations were begun. These were important, as the\r\ncolonists had determined not to return to Granite House until their\r\ndouble end had been obtained—to destroy the convicts and find Ayrton,\r\nif he was still alive; and to discover the being who presided so\r\nefficiently over the destinies of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were familiar with all the eastern coast of the island\r\nbetween Claw Cape and the Mandibles; with Tadorn’s Fens; the\r\nneighborhood of Lake Grant; the portion of Jacamar Wood lying between\r\nthe road to the corral and the Mercy; the courses of the Mercy and Red\r\nCreek, and those spurs of Mount Franklin where the corral was located.\r\n\r\nThey had partially explored the long sweep of Washington Bay from Claw\r\nCape to Reptile End; the wooded and marshy shore of the west coast, and\r\nthe interminable downs which extended to the half-open mouth of Shark\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\nBut they were unacquainted with the vast woods of Serpentine Peninsula;\r\nall the right bank of the Mercy; the left bank of Fall River, and the\r\nconfused mass of ravines and ridges which covered three-fourths of the\r\nbase of Mount Franklin on the west, north, and east, and where,\r\ndoubtless, there existed deep recesses. Therefore, many thousands of\r\nacres had not yet been explored.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the expedition should cross the Forest of the Far\r\nWest, in such a manner as to go over all that part situated on the\r\nright of the Mercy. Perhaps it would have been better to have gone at\r\nonce to the corral, where it was probable the convicts had either\r\npillaged the place or installed themselves there. But either the\r\npillage was a work accomplished or the convicts had purposed to\r\nentrench themselves there, and it would always be time to dislodge\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo the first plan was decided upon, and it was resolved to cut a road\r\nthrough these woods, placing Granite House in communication with the\r\nend of the peninsula, a distance of sixteen or seventeen miles.\r\n\r\nThe wagon was in perfect order. The onagers, well rested, were in\r\nexcellent condition for a long pull. Victuals, camp utensils, and the\r\nportable stove, were loaded into the wagon, together with a careful\r\nselection of arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\nNo one was left in Granite House; even Top and Jup took part in the\r\nexpedition. The inaccessible dwelling could take care of itself.\r\n\r\nSunday, the day before the departure, was observed as a day of rest and\r\nprayer, and on the morning of the 15th Smith took the measures\r\nnecessary to defend Granite House from invasion. The ladders were\r\ncarried to the Chimneys and buried there, the basket of the elevator\r\nwas removed, and nothing left of the apparatus. Pencroff, who remained\r\nbehind in Granite House, saw to this latter, and then slid down to the\r\nground by means of a double cord which, dropped to the ground, severed\r\nthe last connection between the entrance and the shore.\r\n\r\nThe weather was superb.\r\n\r\n“It is going to be a warm day,” said the reporter, joyfully.\r\n\r\n“But, Doctor Spilett,” said Pencroff, “our road is under the trees, and\r\nwe will never see the sun!”\r\n\r\n“Forward!” said the engineer.\r\n\r\nThe wagon was ready on the bank. The reporter insisted on Herbert\r\ntaking a seat in it, at least for the first few hours. Neb walked by\r\nthe onagers. Smith, the reporter, and the sailor went on ahead. Top\r\nbounded off into the grass; Jup took a seat beside Herbert, and the\r\nlittle party started.\r\n\r\nThe wagon went up the left bank of the Mercy, across the bridge, and\r\nthere, leaving the route to Balloon Harbor to the left, the explorers\r\nbegan to make a way through the forest.\r\n\r\nFor the first two miles, the trees grew sufficiently apart to permit\r\nthe wagon to proceed easily, without any other obstacle than here and\r\nthere a stump or some bushes to arrest their progress. The thick\r\nfoliage made a cool shadow over the ground. Birds and beasts were\r\nplenty, and reminded the colonists of their early excursions on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” remarked Smith, “I notice that the animals are more\r\ntimid than formerly. These woods have been recently traversed by the\r\nconvicts, and we shall certainly find their traces.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, in many places, they saw where a party of men had passed,\r\nor built a fire, but in no one place was there a definite camp.\r\n\r\nThe engineer had charged his companions to abstain from hunting, so as\r\nnot to make the convicts aware of their presence by the sound of\r\nfirearms.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, some six miles from Granite House, the advance became\r\nvery difficult, and they had to pass certain thickets, into which Top\r\nand Jup were sent as skirmishers.\r\n\r\nThe halt for the night was made, nine miles from Granite House, on the\r\nbank of a small affluent to the Mercy, of whose existence they had been\r\nunaware. They had good appetites, and all made a hearty supper, after\r\nwhich the camp was carefully organized, in order to guard against a\r\nsurprise from the convicts. Two of the colonists kept guard together in\r\nwatches of two hours, but Herbert, in spite of his wishes, was not\r\nallowed to do duty.\r\n\r\nThe night passed without incident. The silence was unbroken save by the\r\ngrowling of jaguars and the chattering of monkeys, which seemed\r\nparticularly to annoy Jup.\r\n\r\nThe next day, they were unable to accomplish more than six miles. Like\r\ntrue “frontiersmen,” the colonists avoided the large trees and cut down\r\nonly the smaller ones, so that their road was a winding one.\r\n\r\nDuring the day Herbert discovered some specimens of the tree ferns,\r\nwith vase-shaped leaves, and the algarobabeau (St. John’s bread), which\r\nthe onagers eat greedily. Splendid kauris, disposed in groups, rose to\r\na height of two hundred feet, their cylindrical trunks surmounted by a\r\ncrown of verdure.\r\n\r\nAs to fauna, they discovered no new specimens, but they saw, without\r\nbeing able to approach them, a couple of large birds, such as are\r\ncommon in Australia, a sort of cassowary, called emus, which were five\r\nfeet high, of brown plumage, and belonged to the order of runners. Top\r\ntried his best to catch them, but they outran him easily, so great was\r\ntheir speed.\r\n\r\nThe colonists again found traces of the convicts. Near a\r\nrecently-extinguished fire they found footprints, which they examined\r\nwith great attention. By measuring these tracks they were able to\r\ndetermine the presence of five men. The five convicts had evidently\r\ncamped here; but—and they made minute search—they could not discover a\r\nsixth track, which would have been that of Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton is not with them!” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Pencroff, “the wretches have shot him.” But they must\r\nhave a den, to which we can track them.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the reporter. “It is more likely that they intend to camp\r\nabout in places, after this manner, until they become masters of the\r\nisland.”\r\n\r\n“Masters of the island!” cried the sailor. “Masters of the island,\r\nindeed” he repeated in a horrified voice. Then he added:——\r\n\r\n“The ball in my gun is the one which wounded Herbert and it will do its\r\nerrand!”\r\n\r\nBut this just reprisal would not restore Ayrton to life, and the only\r\nconclusion to be drawn, from the footprints was that they would never\r\nsee him again!\r\n\r\nThat evening the camp was made fourteen miles front Granite House, and\r\nSmith estimated that it was still five miles to Reptile End.\r\n\r\nThe next day this point was reached, and the full length of the forest\r\nhad been traversed; but nothing indicated the retreat of the convicts,\r\nnor the asylum of the mysterious unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION OF REPTILE END—CAMP AT THE MOUTH OF FALL RIVER—BY THE\r\nCORRAL—THE RECONNOISSANCE—THE RETURN—FORWARD—AN OPEN DOOR—A LIGHT IN\r\nTHE WINDOW—BY MOONLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 18th, was devoted to an exploration of the wooded\r\nshore lying between Reptile End and Fall River. The colonists were\r\nsearching through the heart of the forest, whose width, bounded by the\r\nshores of the promontory, was from three to four miles. The trees, by\r\ntheir size and foliage, bore witness to the richness of the soil, more\r\nproductive here than in any other portion of the island. It seemed as\r\nif a portion of the virgin forests of America or Central Africa had\r\nbeen transported here. It seemed, also, as if these superb trees found\r\nbeneath the soil, moist on its surface, but heated below by volcanic\r\nfires, a warmth not belonging to a temperate climate. The principal\r\ntrees, both in number and size, were the kauris and eucalypti.\r\n\r\nBut the object of the colonists was not to admire these magnificent\r\nvegetables. They knew already that, in this respect, their island\r\nmerited a first place in the Canaries, called, formerly, the Fortunate\r\nIsles. But, alas! their island no longer belonged to them alone; others\r\nhad taken possession, wretches whom it was necessary to destroy to the\r\nlast man.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast they found no further traces of any kind.\r\n\r\n“This does not astonish me,” said Smith. “The convicts landed near\r\nJetsam Point, and, after having crossed Tadorn’s Fens, they buried\r\nthemselves in the forests of the Far West. They took nearly the same\r\nroute which we have followed. That explains the traces we have seen in\r\nthe woods. Arrived upon the shore, the convicts saw very clearly that\r\nit offered no convenient shelter, and it was then, on going towards the\r\nnorth, that they discovered the corral—”\r\n\r\n“Where they may have returned,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” answered the engineer, “as they would judge that\r\nour searches would be in that direction. The corral is only a\r\nprovisional and not a permanent retreat for them.”\r\n\r\n“I think so, too,” said the reporter, “and, further, that they have\r\nsought a hiding place among the spurs of Mount Franklin.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us push on to the corral!” cried Pencroff. “An end must be\r\nput to this thing, and we are only losing time here.”\r\n\r\n“No, my friend,” replied the engineer.\r\n\r\n“You forget that we are interested in determining whether the forests\r\nof the Far West do not shelter some habitation. Our exploration has a\r\ndouble end, Pencroff; to punish crime and to make a discovery.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very well, sir,” replied the sailor, “but I have an idea\r\nthat we will not discover our friend unless he chooses!”\r\n\r\nPencroff had expressed the opinion of the others as well as his own. It\r\nwas, indeed, probable that the retreat of the unknown being was no less\r\nmysterious than his personality.\r\n\r\nThis evening the wagon halted at the mouth of Fall River. The\r\nencampment was made in the usual way, with the customary precautions.\r\nHerbert had recovered his former strength by this march in the fresh\r\nsalt air, and his place was no longer on the wagon, but at the head of\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, the colonists left the shore and followed up the left bank\r\nof Fall River. The route was already partially cleared, owing to the\r\nprevious excursions made from the corral to the west coast. They\r\nreached a place six miles from Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s project was to observe with great care all the valley\r\nthrough which flowed the river, and to work cautiously up to the\r\ncorral. If they should find it occupied, they were to secure it by main\r\nforce, but if it should be empty, it was to be used as the point from\r\nwhich the explorations of Mount Franklin would be made.\r\n\r\nThe road was through a narrow valley, separating two of the most\r\nprominent spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees grew closely together on\r\nthe banks of the river, but were more scattered on the upper slopes.\r\nThe ground was very much broken, affording excellent opportunities for\r\nan ambush, so that it was necessary to advance with great caution. Top\r\nand Jup went ahead, exploring the thickets on either hand, but nothing\r\nindicated either the presence or nearness of the convicts, or that\r\nthese banks had been recently visited.\r\n\r\nAbout 5 o’clock the wagon halted 600 paces from the enclosure, hidden\r\nby a curtain of tall trees.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to reconnoitre the place, in order to find out whether\r\nit was occupied, but to do this in the day-time was to run the risk of\r\nbeing shot; nevertheless Spilett wanted to make the experiment at once,\r\nand Pencroff, out of all patience, wanted to go with him. But Smith\r\nwould not permit it.\r\n\r\n“No, my friends,” said he, “wait until nightfall. I will not allow one\r\nof you to expose yourselves in the daylight.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir,”—urged the sailor, but little disposed to obey.\r\n\r\n“Pray do not go, Pencroff,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the sailor. But he gave vent to his anger by calling\r\nthe convicts everything bad that he could think of.\r\n\r\nThe colonists remained about the wagon, keeping a sharp lookout in the\r\nadjoining parts of the forest.\r\n\r\nThree hours passed in this manner. The wind fell, and absolute silence\r\nreigned over everything. The slightest sound—the snapping of a twig, a\r\nstep on the dry leaves—could easily have been heard. But all was quiet.\r\nTop rested with his head between his paws, giving no sign of\r\ninquietude.\r\n\r\nBy 8 o’clock the evening was far enough advanced for the reconnoissance\r\nto be undertaken, and Spilett and Pencroff set off alone. Top and Jup\r\nremained behind with the others, as it was necessary that no bark or\r\ncry should give the alarm.\r\n\r\n“Do not do anything imprudently,” urged Smith. “Remember, you are not\r\nto take possession of the corral, but only to find out whether it is\r\noccupied or not.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” answered Pencroff.\r\n\r\nThe two set out, advancing with the greatest caution. Under the trees,\r\nthe darkness was such as to render objects, thirty or forty paces\r\ndistant, invisible. Five minutes after having left the wagon they\r\nreached the edge of the opening, at the end of which rose the fence of\r\nthe enclosure. Here they halted. Some little light still illuminated\r\nthe glade. Thirty paces distant was the gate of the corral, which\r\nseemed to be closed. These thirty paces which it was necessary to cross\r\nconstituted, to use a ballistic expression, the dangerous zone, as a\r\nshot from the palisade would certainly have killed any one venturing\r\nhimself within this space,\r\n\r\nSpilett and the sailor were not men to shirk danger, but they knew that\r\nany imprudence of theirs would injure their companions as well as\r\nthemselves. If they were killed what would become of the others?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Pencroff was so excited in finding himself again close to\r\nthe corral that he would have hurried forward had not the strong hand\r\nof Spilett detained him. “In a few minutes it will be dark,” whispered\r\nthe reporter.\r\n\r\nPencroff grasped his gun nervously, and waited unwillingly.\r\n\r\nVery soon the last rays of light disappeared. Mount Franklin loomed\r\ndarkly against the western sky, and the night fell with the rapidity\r\npeculiar to these low latitudes. Now was the time.\r\n\r\nThe reporter and Pencroff, ever since their arrival on the edge of the\r\nwood, had watched the corral. It seemed to be completely deserted. The\r\nupper edge of the palisade was in somewhat stronger relief than the\r\nsurrounding shades, and nothing broke its outlines. Nevertheless, if\r\nthe convicts were there, they must have posted one of their number as a\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nSpilett took the hand of his companion, and crept cautiously forward to\r\nthe gate of the corral. Pencroff tried to push it open, but it was, as\r\nthey had supposed, fastened. But the sailor discovered that the outer\r\nbars were not in place. They, therefore, concluded that the convicts\r\nwere within, and had fastened the gate so that it could only be broken\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThey listened. No sound broke the silence. The animals were doubtless\r\nsleeping in their sheds. Should they scale the fence? It was contrary\r\nto Smith’s instructions. They might be successful or they might fail.\r\nAnd, if there was now a chance of surprising the convicts, should they\r\nrisk that chance in this way?\r\n\r\nThe reporter thought not. He decided that it would be better to wait\r\nuntil they were all together before making the attempt. Two things were\r\ncertain, that they could reach the fence unseen, and that the place\r\nseemed unguarded.\r\n\r\nPencroff, probably, agreed to this, for he returned with the reporter\r\nto the wood, and a few minutes later Smith was informed of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he after reflecting for a moment, “I don’t think that the\r\nconvicts are here.”\r\n\r\n“We will find out when we have climbed in.” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“To the corral, my friends.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we leave the wagon in the wood?” cried Neb.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Smith, “it may serve as a defense in case of need.”\r\n\r\nThe wagon issued from the wood and rolled noiselessly over the ground.\r\nThe darkness and the silence were profound. The colonists kept their\r\nguns in readiness to fire. Jup kept behind, at Pencroff’s order, and\r\nNeb held Top.\r\n\r\nSoon the dangerous zone was crossed, and the wagon was drawn up beside\r\nthe fence. Neb stood at the head of the onagers to keep them quiet, and\r\nthe others went to the gate to determine if it was barricaded on the\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nOne of its doors was open!\r\n\r\n“What did you tell us?” exclaimed the engineer, turning to the sailor\r\nand Spilett.\r\n\r\nThey were stupefied with amazement.\r\n\r\n“Upon my soul,” cried the sailor, “It was shut a minute ago!”\r\n\r\nThe colonists hesitated. The convicts must have been in the corral when\r\nPencroff and the reporter had made their reconnoissance; for the gate\r\ncould only have been opened by them. Were they still there?\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Herbert, who had ventured some steps within the\r\ninclosure, rushed back and seized Smith’s hand.\r\n\r\n“What have you seen?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“A light!”\r\n\r\n“In the house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\nAll went forward and saw a feeble ray of light trembling through the\r\nwindows of the building.\r\n\r\nSmith determined what to do at once.\r\n\r\n“It is a fortunate chance, finding the convicts shut up in this house\r\nnot expecting anything! They are ours! Come on!”\r\n\r\nThe wagon was left under charge of Top and Jup, and the colonists\r\nglided into the enclosure. In a few moments they were before the closed\r\ndoor of the house.\r\n\r\nSmith, making a sign to his companions not to move, approached the\r\nwindow. He looked into the one room which formed the lower story of the\r\nbuilding. On the table was a lighted lantern, Near by was Ayrton’s bed.\r\nOn it was the body of a man.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Smith uttered a stiffled exclamation.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton!” he cried.\r\n\r\nAnd, at once, the door was rather forced than opened, and all rushed\r\ninto the chamber.\r\n\r\nAyrton seemed to be sleeping. His face showed marks of long and cruel\r\nsuffering. His wrists and ankles were much bruised.\r\n\r\nSmith leaned over him.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton!” cried the engineer, seizing in his arms this man found so\r\nunexpectedly.\r\n\r\nAyrton opened his eyes, and looked first at Smith, then at the others.\r\n\r\n“You! Is it you?” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton! Ayrton!” repeated the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?”\r\n\r\n“In the corral.”\r\n\r\n“Am I alone?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then they will come here!” cried Ayrton. “Look out for yourselves!\r\nDefend yourselves!” and he fell back, fainting.\r\n\r\n“Spilett,” said the engineer, “We may be attacked at any minute. Bring\r\nthe wagon inside the enclosure, and bar the gate, and then come back\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nPencroff, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the orders of the\r\nengineer. There was not an instant to be lost. Perhaps the wagon was\r\nalready in the hands of the convicts!\r\n\r\nIn a moment the reporter and his companions had gained the gate of the\r\nenclosure, behind which they heard Top growling.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, leaving Ayrton for a moment, left the house, and held his\r\ngun in readiness to fire. Herbert was beside him. Both scrutinized the\r\noutline of the mountain spur overlooking the corral. If the convicts\r\nwere hidden in that place they could pick off the colonists one after\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nJust then the moon appeared in the east above the black curtain of the\r\nforest, throwing a flood of light over the interior of the corral, and\r\nbringing into relief the trees, the little water-course, and the grassy\r\ncarpet. Towards the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade\r\nshone white; opposite it, towards the gate, the fence was in shadow.\r\n\r\nA black mass soon showed itself. It was the wagon entering within the\r\ncircle of light, and Smith could hear the sound of the gate closing and\r\nbeing solidly barricaded by his companions.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment Top, by a violent effort, broke his fastening, and,\r\nbarking furiously, rushed to the extremity of the corral to the right\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\n“Look out, my friends, be ready!” cried Smith.\r\n\r\nThe colonists waited, with their guns at the shoulder. Top continued to\r\nbark, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered sharp cries.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, following him, came to the border of the little brook,\r\novershadowed by large trees.\r\n\r\nAnd there, in the full moonlight, what did they see?\r\n\r\nFive corpses lay extended upon the bank!\r\n\r\nThey were the bodies of the convicts, who, four months before, had\r\nlanded upon Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAYRTON’S RECITAL—PLANS OF HIS OLD COMRADES—TAKING POSSESSION OF THE\r\nCORRAL—THE RULES OF THE ISLAND—THE GOOD LUCK—RESEARCHES ABOUT MOUNT\r\nFRANKLIN—THE UPPER VALLEYS —SUBTERRANEAN RUMBLINGS—PENCROFF’S ANSWER—AT\r\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER-THE RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nHow had it happened? Who had killed the convicts? Ayrton? No, since the\r\nmoment before he had feared their return!\r\n\r\nBut Ayrton was now in a slumber from which it was impossible to arouse\r\nhim. After he had spoken these few words, he had fallen back upon his\r\nbed, seized by a sudden torpor.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, terribly excited, preyed upon by a thousand confused\r\nthoughts, remained all night in the house. The next morning Ayrton\r\nawoke from his sleep, and his companions demonstrated to him their joy\r\nat finding him safe and sound after all these months of separation.\r\n\r\nThen Ayrton related in a few words all that had happened.\r\n\r\nThe day after his return to the corral, the 10th of November, just at\r\nnightfall, he had been surprised by the convicts, who had climbed over\r\nthe fence. He was tied and gagged and taken to a dark cavern at the\r\nfoot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had a retreat.\r\n\r\nHis death had been resolved upon, and he was to be killed the following\r\nday, when one of the convicts recognized him and called him by the name\r\nhe had borne in Australia. These wretches, who would have massacred\r\nAyrton, respected Ben Joyce.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment Ayrton was subjected to the importunities of his old\r\ncomrades. They wished to gain him over to them, and they counted upon\r\nhim to take Granite House, to enter that inaccessible dwelling, and to\r\nbecome masters of the island, after having killed the colonists.\r\n\r\nAyrton resisted. The former convict, repentant and pardoned, would\r\nrather die than betray his companions.\r\n\r\nFor four months, fastened, gagged, watched, he had remained in this\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the convicts lived upon the stock in the corral, but did not\r\ninhabit the place.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of November, two of these bandits, inopportunely surprised\r\nby the arrival of the colonists, fired on Herbert, and one of them\r\nreturned boasting of having killed one of the inhabitants. His\r\ncompanion, as we know, had fallen at Smith’s hand.\r\n\r\nOne can judge of Ayrton’s despair, when he heard of Herbert’s death! It\r\nleft but four of the colonists, almost at the mercy of the convicts!\r\n\r\nFollowing this event, and during all the time that the colonists,\r\ndetained by Herbert’s illness, remained at the corral, the pirates did\r\nnot leave their cave; indeed, after having pillaged Prospect Plateau,\r\nthey did not deem it prudent to leave it.\r\n\r\nThe bad treatment of Ayrton was redoubled. His hands and feet still\r\nbore the red marks of the lines with which he remained bound, day and\r\nnight. Each moment he expected to be killed.\r\n\r\nThis was the third week in February. The convicts, awaiting a favorable\r\nopportunity, rarely left their retreat, and then only to a point in the\r\ninterior or on the west coast. Ayrton had no news of his friends, and\r\nno hopes of seeing them again.\r\n\r\nFinally, the poor unfortunate, enfeebled by bad treatment, fell in a\r\nprofound prostration in which he neither saw nor heard anything. From\r\nthis moment, he could not say what had happened.\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Smith,” he added, “since I was imprisoned in this cavern, how\r\nis it that I am here?”\r\n\r\n“How is that the convicts are lying there, dead, in the middle of the\r\ncorral?” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” cried Ayrton, half rising, notwithstanding his feebleness. His\r\ncompanions assisted him to get up, and all went to the little brook.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight. There on the shore, in the position in which\r\nthey had met their deaths, lay the five convicts.\r\n\r\nAyrton was astounded. The others looked on without speaking. Then, at a\r\nsign from Smith, Neb and Pencroff examined the bodies. Not a wound was\r\nvisible upon them. Only after minute search, Pencroff perceived on the\r\nforehead of one, on the breast of another, on this one’s back, and on\r\nthe shoulder of a fourth, a small red mark, a hardly visible bruise,\r\nmade by some unknown instrument.\r\n\r\n“There is where they have been hit!” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“But with what sort of a weapon?” cried the reporter.\r\n\r\n“A destructive weapon enough, though unknown to us!”\r\n\r\n“And who has destroyed them?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“The ruler of the island,” answered Smith, “he who has brought you\r\nhere, Ayrton, whose influence is again manifesting itself, who does for\r\nus what we are unable to do for ourselves, and who then hides from us.”\r\n\r\n“Let us search for him!” cried Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we will search,” replied Smith; “but the being who accomplishes\r\nsuch prodigies will not be found until it pleases him to call us to\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nThis invisible protection, which nullified their own actions, both\r\nannoyed and affected the engineer. The relative inferiority in which it\r\nplaced him wounded his pride. A generosity which so studiously eluded\r\nall mark of recognition denoted a sort of disdain for those benefited,\r\nwhich, in a measure, detracted from the value of the gift.\r\n\r\n“Let us search,” he repeated, “and Heaven grant that some day we be\r\npermitted to prove to this haughty protector that he is not dealing\r\nwith ingrates! What would I not give to be able, in our turn, to repay\r\nhim, and to render him, even at the risk of our lives, some signal\r\nservice!”\r\n\r\nFrom this time, this search was the single endeavor of the inhabitants\r\nof Lincoln Island. All tried to discover the answer to this enigma, an\r\nanswer which involved the name of a man endowed with an inexplicable,\r\nan almost superhuman power.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, the colonists entered the house again, and their\r\nefforts soon restored Ayrton to himself. Neb and Pencroff carried away\r\nthe bodies of the convicts and buried them in the wood. Then, Ayrton\r\nwas informed by the engineer of all that had happened during his\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Smith, finishing his recital, “we have one thing more\r\nto do. Half of our task is accomplished; but if the convicts are no\r\nlonger to be feared, we did not restore ourselves to the mastership of\r\nthe island!”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied Spilett, “let us search all the mazes of Mount\r\nFranklin. Let us leave no cavity, no hole unexplored! Ah! if ever a\r\nreporter found himself in the presence of an exciting mystery. I am in\r\nthat position!”\r\n\r\n“And we will not return to Granite House,” said Herbert, “until we have\r\nfound our benefactor.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Smith, “we will do everything that is possible for human\r\nbeings to do—but, I repeat it, we will not find him till he wills it.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we stay here at the corral?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the engineer, “let us remain here. Provisions are\r\nabundant, and we are in the centre of our circle of investigation, and,\r\nmoreover, if it is necessary, the wagon can go quickly to Granite\r\nHouse.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Pencroff. “Only one thing.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the fine weather is here, and we must not forget that we have a\r\nvoyage to make.”\r\n\r\n“A voyage?” asked Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Yes, to Tabor Island. We most put up a notice, indicating our island,\r\nin case the Scotch yacht returns. Who knows that it is not already too\r\nlate?”\r\n\r\n“But, Pencroff,” asked Ayrton, “how do you propose to make this\r\nvoyage?”\r\n\r\n“Why, on the Good Luck!”\r\n\r\n“The Good Luck!” cried Ayrton. “It’s gone!”\r\n\r\n“Gone!” shouted Pencroff, springing to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Yes. The convicts discovered where the sloop lay, and, a week ago,\r\nthey put out to sea in her, and—”\r\n\r\n“And?” said Pencroff, his heart trembling.\r\n\r\n“And, not having Harvey to manage her, they ran her upon the rocks, and\r\nshe broke all to pieces!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! the wretches! the pirates! the devils!” exclaimed the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Pencroff,” said Herbert, taking his hand, “we will build another, a\r\nlarger Good Luck. We have all the iron, all the rigging of the brig at\r\nour disposal!”\r\n\r\n“But, do you realize,” answered Pencroff, “that it will take at least\r\nfive or six months to build a vessel of thirty or forty tons.”\r\n\r\n“We will take our time,” replied the reporter, “and we will give up our\r\nvoyage to Tabor Island for this year.”\r\n\r\n“We must make the best of it, Pencroff,” said the engineer, “and I hope\r\nthat this delay will not be prejudicial to us.”\r\n\r\n“My poor Good Luck! my poor boat!” exclaimed the sailor, half\r\nbroken-hearted at the loss of what was so dear to him.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the sloop was a thing much to be regretted, and it\r\nwas agreed that this loss must be repaired as soon as the search was\r\nended.\r\n\r\nThis search was begun the same day, the 19th of February, and lasted\r\nthroughout the week. The base of the mountain was composed of a perfect\r\nlabyrinth of ravines and gorges, and it was here that the explorations\r\nmust be made. No other part of the island was so well suited to hide an\r\ninhabitant who wished to remain concealed. But so great was the\r\nintricacy of these places that Smith explored them by a settled system.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the colonists visited the valley opening to the\r\nsouth of the volcano, in which Fall River rose. Here was where Ayrton\r\nshowed them the cavern of the convicts. This place was in exactly the\r\nsame condition as Ayrton had left it. They found here a quantity of\r\nfood and ammunition left there as a reserve by the convicts.\r\n\r\nAll this beautiful wooded valley was explored with great care, and\r\nthen, the south-western spur having been turned, the colonists searched\r\na narrow gorge where the trees were less numerous. Here the stones took\r\nthe place of grass, and the wild goats and moufflons bounded among the\r\nrocks. The arid part of the island began at this part. They saw already\r\nthat, of the numerous valleys ramifying from the base of Mount\r\nFranklin, three only, bounded on the west by Fall River and on the east\r\nby Red Creek, were as rich and fertile as the valley of the corral.\r\nThese two brooks, which developed into rivers as they progressed,\r\nreceived the whole of the mountain’s southern water-shed and fertilized\r\nthat portion of it. As to the Mercy it was more directly fed by\r\nabundant springs, hidden in Jacamar Wood.\r\n\r\nNow any one of these three valleys would have answered for the retreat\r\nof some recluse, who would have found there all the necessaries of\r\nlife. But the colonists had explored each of them without detecting the\r\npresence of man. Was it then at the bottom of these arid gorges, in the\r\nmidst of heaps of rocks, in the rugged ravines to the north, between\r\nthe streams of lava, that they would find this retreat and its\r\noccupant?\r\n\r\nThe northern part of Mount Franklin had at its base two large, arid\r\nvalleys strewn with lava, sown with huge rocks, sprinkled with pieces\r\nof obsidian and labradorite. This part required long and difficult\r\nexploration. Here were a thousand cavities, not very comfortable,\r\nperhaps, but completely hidden and difficult of access. The colonists\r\nvisited sombre tunnels, made in the plutonic epoch, still blackened by\r\nthe fires of other days, which plunged into the heart of the mountain.\r\nThey searched these dark galleries by the light of torches, peering\r\ninto their least excavations and sounding their lowest depths. But\r\neverywhere was silence, obscurity. It did not seem as if any human\r\nbeing had ever trodden these antique corridors or an arm displaced one\r\nof these stones.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if these places were absolutely deserted, if the\r\nobscurity was complete, Smith was forced to notice that absolute\r\nsilence did not reign there.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the bottom of one of those sombre cavities, which\r\nextended several hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was\r\nsurprised to hear deep muttering sounds which were intensified by the\r\nsonority of the rocks.\r\n\r\nSpilett, who was with him, also heard these distant murmurs, which\r\nindicated an awakening of the subterranean fires.\r\n\r\nSeveral times they listened, and they came to the conclusion that some\r\nchemical reaction was going on in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\n“The volcano is not entirely extinct,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“It is possible that, since our exploration of the crater, something\r\nhas happened in its lower regions. All volcanoes, even those which are\r\nsaid to be extinct, can, evidently, become active again.”\r\n\r\n“But if Mount Franklin is preparing for another eruption, is not\r\nLincoln Island in danger?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” answered the engineer, “The crater, that is to say,\r\nthe safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of vapors and lavas will\r\nescape, as heretofore, by its accustomed outlet.”\r\n\r\n“Unless the lavas make a new passage towards the fertile parts of the\r\nisland.”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear Spilett, should they not follow their natural course?”\r\n\r\n“Well, volcanoes are capricious.”\r\n\r\n“Notice,” said Smith, “that all the slope of the mountain favors the\r\nflow of eruptive matter towards the valleys which we are traversing at\r\npresent. It would take an earthquake to so change the centre of gravity\r\nof the mountain as to modify this slope.”\r\n\r\n“But an earthquake is always possible under these conditions.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied the engineer, “especially when the subterranean forces\r\nare awakening, and the bowels of the earth, after a long repose, chance\r\nto be obstructed. You are right, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be\r\na serious thing for us, and it would be better if this volcano has not\r\nthe desire to wake up; but we can do nothing. Nevertheless, in any\r\ncase, I do not think Prospect Plateau could be seriously menaced.\r\nBetween it and the lake there is quite a depression in the land, and\r\neven if the lavas took the road to the lake, they would be distributed\r\nover the downs and the parts adjoining Shark Gulf.”\r\n\r\n“We have not yet seen any smoke from the summit, indicating a near\r\neruption,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the engineer, “not the least vapor has escaped from the\r\ncrater. It was but yesterday that I observed its upper part. But it is\r\npossible that rocks, cinders, and hardened lavas have accumulated in\r\nthe lower part of its chimney, and, for the moment, this safety-valve\r\nis overloaded. But, at the first serious effort, all obstacles will\r\ndisappear, and you may be sure, my dear Spilett, that neither the\r\nisland, which is the boiler, nor the volcano, which is the valve, will\r\nburst under the pressure. Nevertheless, I repeat, it is better to wish\r\nfor no eruption.”\r\n\r\n“And yet we are not mistaken,” replied the reporter. “We plainly hear\r\nominous rumblings in the depths of the volcano!”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the engineer, after listening again with the utmost\r\nattention, “that is not to be mistaken. Something is going on there the\r\nimportance of which cannot be estimated nor what the result will be.”\r\n\r\nSmith and Spilett, on rejoining their companions, told them of these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“All right!” cried Pencroff. “This volcano wants to take care of us!\r\nBut let it try! It will find its master!”\r\n\r\n“Who’s that?” asked the negro.\r\n\r\n“Our genius, Neb, our good genius, who will put a gag in the mouth of\r\nthe crater if it attempts to open it.”\r\n\r\nThe confidence of the sailor in the guardian of the island was\r\nabsolute, and, indeed, the occult power which had so far been\r\nmanifested seemed limitless; but, thus far this being had escaped all\r\nthe efforts the colonists had made to discover him.\r\n\r\nFrom the 19th to the 25th of February, the investigations were\r\nconducted in the western portion of Lincoln Island, where the most\r\nsecret recesses were searched. They even sounded each rocky wall, as\r\none knocks against the walls of a suspected house. The engineer went so\r\nfar as to take the exact measure of the mountain, and he pushed his\r\nsearch to the last strata sustaining it. It was explored to the summit\r\nof the truncated cone which rose above the first rocky level, and from\r\nthere to the upper edge of the enormous cap at the bottom of which\r\nopened the crater.\r\n\r\nThey did more; they visited the gulf, still extinct, but in whose\r\ndepths the rumblings were distinctly heard. Nevertheless, not a smoke,\r\nnot a vapor, no heat in the wall, indicated a near eruption. But\r\nneither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the\r\ncolonists find the traces of him whom they sought.\r\n\r\nTheir investigations were then directed over all the tract of downs.\r\nThey carefully examined the high lava walls of Shark Gulf from base to\r\nsummit, although it was very difficult to reach the water level. No\r\none! Nothing!\r\n\r\nThese two words summed up in brief the result of all the useless\r\nfatigues Smith and his companions had been at, and they were a trifle\r\nannoyed at their ill success.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary now to think of returning, as these researches\r\ncould not be pursued indefinitely. The colonists were convinced that\r\nthis mysterious being did not reside upon the surface of the island,\r\nand strange thoughts floated through their over-excited imaginations;\r\nNeb and Pencroff, particularly, went beyond the strange into the region\r\nof the supernatural. The 25th of February, the colonists returned to\r\nGranite House, and by means of the double cord, shot by an arrow to the\r\ndoor-landing, communication was established with their domain.\r\n\r\nOne month later, they celebrated the third anniversary of their arrival\r\non Lincoln Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THREE YEARS—THE QUESTION OF A NEW SHIP—ITS\r\nDETERMINATION—PROSPERITY OF THE COLONY—THE SHIPYARD—THE COLD\r\nWEATHER—PENCROFF RESIGNED—WASHING—MOUNT FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree years had passed since the prisoners had fled from Richmond, and\r\nin all that time their conversation and their thoughts had been of the\r\nfatherland.\r\n\r\nThey had no doubt that the war was ended, and that the North had\r\ntriumphed. But how? At what cost? What friends had fallen in the\r\nstruggle? They often talked of these things, although they had no\r\nknowledge when they would be able to see that country again. To return,\r\nif only for a few days; to renew their intercourse with civilization;\r\nto establish a communication between their island and the mother\r\ncountry, and then to spend the greater part of their lives in this\r\ncolony which they had founded and which would then be raised to a\r\nmetropolis, was this a dream which could not be realized?\r\n\r\nThere were but two ways of realizing it: either a ship would some day\r\nshow itself in the neighborhood of Lincoln Island, or the colonists\r\nmust themselves build a vessel staunch enough to carry them to the\r\nnearest land.\r\n\r\n“Unless our genius furnishes us with the means of returning home,” said\r\nPencroff.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, if Neb and Pencroff had been told that a 300-ton ship was\r\nwaiting for them in Shark Gulf or Balloon Harbor, they would not have\r\nmanifested any surprise. In their present condition they expected every\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nBut Smith, less confident, urged them to keep to realities, and to\r\nbuild the vessel, whose need was urgent, since a paper should be placed\r\non Tabor Island as soon as possible, in order to indicate the new abode\r\nof Ayrton.\r\n\r\nThe Good Luck was gone. It would take at least six mouths to build\r\nanother vessel, and, as winter was approaching, the voyage could not be\r\nmade before the next spring.\r\n\r\n“We have time to prepare ourself for the fine weather,” said the\r\nengineer, talking of these things with Pencroff. “I think, therefore,\r\nsince we have to build our own ship, it will be better to make her\r\ndimensions greater than before. The arrival of the\r\n\r\nScotch yacht is uncertain. It may even have happened that it has come\r\nand gone. What do you think? Would it not be better to build a vessel,\r\nthat, in case of need, could carry us to the archipelagoes or New\r\nZealand?”\r\n\r\n“I think, sir, that you are as able to build a large vessel as a small\r\none. Neither wood nor tools are wanting. It is only a question of\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“And how long would it take to build a ship of 250 or 300 tons?”\r\n\r\n“Seven or eight months at least. But we must not forget that winter is\r\nat hand, and that the timber will be difficult to work during the\r\nsevere cold. So, allowing for some weeks’ delay, you can be happy if\r\nyou have your ship by next November.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, that will be just the season to undertake a voyage of some\r\nlength, be it to Tabor Island of further.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Mr. Smith, make your plans. The workmen are ready, and I\r\nguess that Ayrton will lend a helping hand.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer’s project met the approval of the colonists, and indeed it\r\nwas the best thing to do. It is true that it was a great undertaking,\r\nbut they had that confidence in themselves, which is one of the\r\nelements of success.\r\n\r\nWhile Smith was busy preparing the plans of the vessel, the others\r\noccupied themselves in felling the trees and preparing the timber. The\r\nforests of the Far West furnished the best oak and elm, which were\r\ncarried over the new road through the forest to the Chimneys, where the\r\nship-yard was established.\r\n\r\nIt was important that the timber should be cut soon, as it was\r\nnecessary to have it seasoning for some time. Therefore the workmen\r\nworked vigorously during April, which was not an inclement month, save\r\nfor some violent wind storms. Jup helped them by his adroitness, either\r\nin climbing to the top of a tree to fasten a rope, or by carrying loads\r\non his strong shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe timber was piled under a huge shed to await its use; and,\r\nmeanwhile, the work in the fields was pushed forward, so that soon all\r\ntraces of the devastation caused by the pirates had disappeared. The\r\nmill was rebuilt, and a new inclosure for the poultry yard. This had to\r\nbe much larger than the former, as the number of its occupants had\r\nincreased largely. The stables contained five onagas, four of them well\r\nbroken, and one little colt. A plough had been added to the stock of\r\nthe colony, and the onagas were employed in tillage as if they were\r\nYorkshire or Kentucky cattle. All the colonists did their share, and\r\nthere were no idle hands. And thus, with good health and spirits, they\r\nformed a thousand projects for the future.\r\n\r\nAyrton, of course, partook of the common existence, and spoke no longer\r\nof returning to the corral. Nevertheless, he was always quiet and\r\nuncommunicative, and shared more in the work than the pleasure of his\r\ncompanions. He was a strong workman, vigorous, adroit, intelligent, and\r\nhe could not fail to see that he was esteemed and loved by the others.\r\nBut the corral was not abandoned. Every other day some one went there\r\nand brought back the supply of milk for the colony, and these occasions\r\nwere also hunting excursions. So that, Herbert and Spilett, with Top in\r\nadvance, oftenest made the journey, and all kinds of game abounded in\r\nthe kitchen of Granite House. The products of the warren and the\r\noyster-bed, some turtles, a haul of excellent salmon, the vegetables\r\nfrom the plateau, the natural fruits of the forest, were riches upon\r\nriches, and Neb, the chief cook, found it difficult to store them all\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph had been repaired, and was used whenever one of the party\r\nremained over night at the corral. But the island was secure now from\r\nany aggression—at least from men.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, what had happened once might happen again, and a descent\r\nof pirates was always to be feared. And it was possible that\r\naccomplices of Harvey, still in Norfolk, might be privy to his projects\r\nand seek to imitate them. Every day the colonists searched the horizon\r\nvisible from Granite House with the glass, and whenever they were at\r\nthe corral they examined the west coast. Nothing appeared, but they\r\nwere always on the alert.\r\n\r\nOne evening the engineer told his companions of a project to fortify\r\nthe corral. It seemed prudent to heighten the palisade, and to flank it\r\nwith a sort of block house, in which the colonists could defend\r\nthemselves against a host of enemies. Granite House, owing to its\r\nposition, was impregnable, and the corral would always be the objective\r\npoint of pirates.\r\n\r\nAbout the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel was laid, and the stem\r\nand stern posts raised. This keel was of oak, 110 feet long, and the\r\nbreadth of beam was 25 feet. But, with the exception of putting up a\r\ncouple of the frame pieces, this was all that could be done before the\r\nbad weather and the cold set in.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the month the weather was very inclement.\r\nPencroff and Ayrton worked as long as they were able, but severely cold\r\nweather following the rain made the wood impossible to handle, and by\r\nthe 10th of June the work was given up entirely, and the colonists were\r\noften obliged to keep in-doors.\r\n\r\nThis confinement was hard for all of them, but especially so for\r\nSpilett.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what, Neb,” he said, “I will give you everything I own\r\nif you will get me a newspaper! All that I want to make me happy is to\r\nknow what is going on in the world!”\r\n\r\nNeb laughed.\r\n\r\n“Faith!” said he, “I am busy enough with my daily work.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, occupation was not wanting. The colony was at the summit\r\nof prosperity. The accident to the brig had been a new source of\r\nriches. Without counting a complete outfit of sails, which would answer\r\nfor the new ship, utensils and tools of all sorts, ammunition,\r\nclothing, and instruments filled the store-rooms of Granite House.\r\nThere was no longer a necessity to manufacture cloth in the felting\r\nmill. Linen, also, was plenty, and they took great care of it. From the\r\nchloride of sodium Smith had easily extracted soda and chlorine. The\r\nsoda was easily transformed into carbonate of soda, and the chlorine\r\nwas employed for various domestic purposes, but especially for cleaning\r\nthe linen. Moreover, they made but four washings a year, as was the\r\ncustom in old times, and Pencroff and Spilett, while waiting for the\r\npostman to bring the paper, made famous washermen!\r\n\r\nThus passed June, July, and August; very rigorous months, in which the\r\nthermometer measured but 8° Fahrenheit. But a good fire burned in the\r\nchimney of Granite House, and the superfluity of wood from the\r\nship-yard enabled them to economize the coal, which required a longer\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nAll, men and beasts, enjoyed good health. Jup, it is true, shivered a\r\nlittle with the cold, and they had to make him a good wadded wrapper.\r\nWhat servant he was! Adroit, zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet,\r\nnot talkative. He was, indeed, a model for his biped brethren in the\r\nNew and the Old World!\r\n\r\n“But, after all,” said Pencroff “when one has four hands, they cannot\r\nhelp doing their work well!”\r\n\r\nDuring the seven months that had passed since the exploration of the\r\nmountain nothing had been seen or heard of the genius of the island.\r\nAlthough, it is true, that nothing had happened to the colonists\r\nrequiring his assistance.\r\n\r\nSmith noticed, too, that the growling of the dog and the anxiety of the\r\norang had ceased during this time. These two friends no longer ran to\r\nthe orifice of the well nor acted in that strange way which had\r\nattracted the attention of the engineer. But did this prove that\r\neverything had happened that was going to happen? That they were never\r\nto find an answer to the enigma? Could it be affirmed that no new\r\nconjunction of circumstances would make this mysterious personage\r\nappear again? Who knows what the future may bring forth?\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September, Smith, looking towards Mount Franklin, saw a\r\nsmoke rising and curling above the crater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING OF THE VOLCANO—THE FINE WEATHER—RESUMPTION OF WORK—THE\r\nEVENING OF THE 15TH OF OCTOBER—A TELEGRAPH—A DEMAND—AN ANSWER—DEPARTURE\r\nFOR THE CORRAL—THE NOTICE—THE EXTRA WIRE—THE BASALT WALL—AT HIGH\r\nTIDE—AT LOW TIDE—THE CAVERN—A DAZZLING LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colonists, called by Smith, had left their work, and gazed in\r\nsilence at the summit of Mount Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe volcano had certainly awakened, and its vapors had penetrated the\r\nmineral matter of the crater, but no one could say whether the\r\nsubterranean fires would bring on a violent eruption.\r\n\r\nBut, even supposing an eruption, it was not likely that Lincoln Island\r\nwould suffer in every part. The discharges of volcanic matter are not\r\nalways disastrous. That the island had already been subjected to an\r\neruption was evident from the currents of lava spread over the western\r\nslope of the mountain. Moreover, the shape of the crater was such as to\r\nvomit matter in the direction away from the fertile parts of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, what had been was no proof of what would be. Often the\r\nold craters of volcanoes close and new ones open. An earthquake\r\nphenomenon, often accompanying volcanic action, may do this by changing\r\nthe interior arrangement of the mountain and opening new passages for\r\nthe incandescent lavas.\r\n\r\nSmith explained these things to his companions, and without\r\nexaggerating the situation, showed them just what might happen.\r\n\r\nAfter all, they could do nothing. Granite House did not seem to be\r\nmenaced, unless by a severe earthquake. But all feared for the corral,\r\nif any new crater opened in the mountain.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the vapor poured from the cone without cessation, and,\r\nindeed, increased in density and volume, although no flame penetrated\r\nits thick folds. The phenomenon was confined, as yet, to the lower part\r\nof the central chimney.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with good weather, the work out of doors had been resumed.\r\nThey hastened the construction of the ship, and Smith established a\r\nsaw-mill at the waterfall, which cut the timber much more rapidly.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of September the frame of the ship, which was to be\r\nschooner-rigged, was so far completed that its shape could be\r\nrecognized. The schooner, sheer forward and wide aft, was well adapted\r\nfor a long voyage, in case of necessity, but the planking, lining, and\r\ndecking still demanded a long time before they could be finished.\r\nFortunately, the iron-work of the brig had been saved after the\r\nexplosion, and Pencroff and Ayrton had obtained a great quantity of\r\ncopper nails from the broken timber, which economized the labor for the\r\nsmiths; nevertheless the carpenters had much to accomplish.\r\n\r\nOften, however, after the day’s work was ended, the colonists sat late\r\ninto the night, conversing together of the future and what might happen\r\nin a voyage in the schooner to the nearest land. But in discussing\r\nthese projects they always planned to return to Lincoln Island. Never\r\nwould they abandon this colony, established with so much difficulty,\r\nbut so successfully, and which would receive a new development through\r\ncommunication with America.\r\n\r\nPencroff and Neb, indeed, hoped to end their days here.\r\n\r\n“Herbert,” asked the sailor, “you would never abandon Lincoln Island?”\r\n\r\n“Never, Pencroff, especially if you made up your mind to remain.”\r\n\r\n“Then, it’s agreed, my boy. I shall expect you! You will bring your\r\nwife and children here, and I will make a jolly playmate for the\r\nbabies!”\r\n\r\n“Agreed,” answered Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same time.\r\n\r\n“And you, Mr. Smith,” continued the sailor, enthusiastically, “you will\r\nalways remain governor of the island! And, by the way, how many\r\ninhabitants can the island support? Ten thousand, at the very least!”\r\n\r\nThey chatted in this way, letting Pencroff indulge in his whims, and\r\none thing leading to another, the reporter finished by founding the\r\n_New Lincoln Herald_!\r\n\r\nThus it is with the spirit of man. The need of doing something\r\npermanent, something which will survive him, is the sign of his\r\nsuperiority over everything here below. It is that which has\r\nestablished and justifies his domination over the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter all, who knows if Jup and Top had not their dream of the future?\r\n\r\nAyrton, silent, said to himself that he wanted to see Lord Glenarvan,\r\nand show him the change in himself.\r\n\r\nOne evening, the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged longer\r\nthan usual. It was 9 o’clock, and already, long, ill-concealed yawns\r\nshowed that it was bed-time. Pencroff was about starting in that\r\ndirection, when, suddenly, the electric bell in the hall rang.\r\n\r\nEvery one was present, so none of their party could be at the corral.\r\n\r\nSmith rose. His companions looked as if they had not heard aright.\r\n\r\n“What does he want?” cried Neb. “Is it the devil that’s ringing?”\r\n\r\nNo one replied.\r\n\r\n“It is stormy weather,” said Herbert; “perhaps the electric\r\ninfluence——”\r\n\r\nHerbert did not finish the sentence. The engineer, towards whom all\r\nwere looking, shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute,” said Spilett. “If it is a signal, it will be\r\nrepeated.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you think it is?” asked Neb.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it——”\r\n\r\nThe sailor’s words were interrupted by another ring.\r\n\r\nSmith went to the apparatus, and, turning on the current, telegraphed\r\nto the corral:——\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the needle, moving over the lettered card, gave\r\nthis answer to the inmates of Granite House:—\r\n\r\n“Come to the corral as quickly as possible.”\r\n\r\n“At last!” cried Smith.\r\n\r\nYes! At last! The mystery was about to be solved! Before the strong\r\ninterest in what was at the corral, all fatigue and need of repose\r\nvanished. Without saying a word, in a few minutes they were out of\r\nGranite House and following the shore. Only Top and Jup remained\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark. The moon, new this day, had set with the sun. Heavy\r\nclouds obscured the stars, but now and then heat-lightning, the\r\nreflection of a distant storm, illuminated the horizon.\r\n\r\nBut, great as the darkness was, it could not hinder persons as familiar\r\nwith the route as were the colonists. All were very much excited, and\r\nwalked rapidly. There could be no doubt that they were going to find\r\nthe answer to the engineer, the name of that mysterious being, who was\r\nso generous in his influence, so powerful to accomplish! It could not\r\nbe doubted that this unknown had been familiar with the least detail of\r\ntheir daily lives, that he overheard all that was said in Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nEach one, lost in his reflections, hurried onward. The darkness under\r\nthe trees was such that the route was invisible. There was no sound in\r\nthe forest. Not a breath of wind moved the leaves.\r\n\r\nThis silence during the first quarter of an hour was uninterrupted,\r\nsave by Pencroff, who said:——\r\n\r\n“We should have brought a lantern.”\r\n\r\nAnd by the engineer’s answer:——\r\n\r\n“We will find one at the corral.”\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past\r\n9. In thirty-five minutes they had traversed three of the five miles\r\nbetween the mouth of the Mercy and the corral.\r\n\r\nJust then, brilliant flashes of lightning threw the foliage into strong\r\nrelief. The storm was evidently about to burst upon them. The flashes\r\nbecame more frequent and intense. Heavy thunder rolled through the\r\nheavens. The air was stifling.\r\n\r\nThe colonists rushed on, as if impelled by some irresistible force.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past 9, a sudden flash showed them the outline of the\r\npalisade; and scarcely had they passed the gateway when there came a\r\nterrible clap of thunder. In a moment the corral was crossed, and Smith\r\nstood before the house. It was possible that the unknown being was\r\nhere, since it was from this place that the telegraph had come.\r\nNevertheless, there was no light in the window.\r\n\r\nThe engineer knocked at the door, but without response.\r\n\r\nHe opened it, and the colonists entered the room, which was in utter\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nA light was struck by Neb, and in a moment the lantern was lit, and its\r\nlight directed into every corner of the chamber.\r\n\r\nNo one was there, and everything remained undisturbed.\r\n\r\n“Are we victims to a delusion?” murmured Smith.\r\n\r\nNo! that was impossible! The telegraph had certainly said:——\r\n\r\n“Come to the corral quickly as possible.”\r\n\r\nHe went to the table on which the apparatus was arranged. Everything\r\nwas in place and in order.\r\n\r\n“Who was here last?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“I, sir,” answered Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“And that was——”\r\n\r\n“Four days ago.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! here is something!” exclaimed Herbert, pointing to a paper lying\r\non the table.\r\n\r\nOn the paper were these words, written in English:——\r\n\r\n“Follow the new wire.”\r\n\r\n“Come on!” cried Smith, who comprehended in a moment that the dispatch\r\nhad not been sent from the corral, but from the mysterious abode which\r\nthe new wire united directly with Granite House.\r\n\r\nNeb took the lantern and all left the corral.\r\n\r\nThen the storm broke forth with extreme violence. Flashes of lightning\r\nand peals of thunder followed in rapid succession. The island was the\r\ncentre of the storm. By the flashes of lightning they could see the\r\nsummit of Mount Franklin enshrouded in smoke.\r\n\r\nThere were no telegraph poles inside the corral, but the engineer,\r\nhaving passed the gate, ran to the nearest post, and saw there a new\r\nwire fastened to the insulator, and reaching to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Here it is!” he cried.\r\n\r\nThe wire lay along the ground, and was covered with some insulating\r\nsubstance, like the submarine cables. By its direction it seemed as if\r\nit went towards the west, across the woods, and the southern spurs of\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\n“Let us follow it,” said Smith.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes by the light of the lantern, sometimes by the\r\nillumination of the heavens, the colonists followed the way indicated\r\nby the thread.\r\n\r\nThey crossed in the first place, the spur of the mountain between the\r\nvalley of the corral and that of Fall River, which stream was crossed\r\nin its narrowest part. The wire, sometimes hanging on the lower\r\nbranches of the trees, sometimes trailing along the ground, was a sure\r\nguide.\r\n\r\nThe engineer had thought that, perhaps, the wire would end at the\r\nbottom of the valley, and that the unknown retreat was there.\r\n\r\nBut not so. It extended over the southwestern spur and descended to the\r\narid plateau which ended that fantastic wall of basalt. Every now and\r\nthen one or other of the party stooped and took the direction of the\r\nwire. There could be no doubt that it ran directly to the sea. There,\r\ndoubtless, in some profound chasm in the igneous rocks, was the\r\ndwelling so vainly sought for until now.\r\n\r\nAt a few minutes before 10, the colonists arrived upon the high coast\r\noverhanging the ocean. Here the wire wound among the rocks, following a\r\nsteep slope down a narrow ravine.\r\n\r\nThe colonists followed it, at the risk of bringing down upon themselves\r\na shower of rocks or of being precipitated into the sea. The descent\r\nwas extremely perilous, but they thought not of the danger; they were\r\nattracted to this mysterious place as the needle is drawn to the\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\nAt length, the wire making a sudden turn, touched the shore rocks,\r\nwhich were beaten by the sea. The colonists had reached the base of the\r\ngranite wall.\r\n\r\nHere there was a narrow projection running parallel and horizontal to\r\nthe sea. The thread led along this point, and the colonists followed.\r\nThey had not proceeded more than a hundred paces, when this projection,\r\nby a south inclination, sloped down into the water.\r\n\r\nThe engineer seized the wire and saw that it led down into the sea.\r\n\r\nHis companions stood, stupefied, beside him.\r\n\r\nThen a cry of disappointment, almost of despair, escaped them! Must\r\nthey throw themselves into the water and search some submarine cavern?\r\nIn their present state of excitement, they would not have hesitated to\r\nhave done it.\r\n\r\nAn observation made by the engineer stopped them. He led his companions\r\nto the shelter of a pile of rocks and said:——\r\n\r\n“Let as wait here. The tide is up. At low water the road will be open.”\r\n\r\n“But how do you think—” began Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“He would not have called us, unless the means of reaching him had been\r\nprovided.”\r\n\r\nSmith had spoken with an air of conviction, and, moreover, his\r\nobservation was logical. It was, indeed, quite possible that an opening\r\nexisted at low water which was covered at present.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to wait some hours. The colonists rested in silence\r\nunder their shelter. The rain began to fall in torrents. The echoes\r\nrepeated the roaring of the thunder in sonorous reverberations.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the engineer took the lantern and went down to the water’s\r\nedge. It was still two hours before low tide.\r\n\r\nSmith had not been mistaken. The entrance to a vast excavation began to\r\nbe visible, and the wire, turning at a right angle, entered this\r\nyawning mouth.\r\n\r\nSmith returned to his companions and said:——\r\n\r\n“In an hour the opening will be accessible.”\r\n\r\n“Then there is one,” said Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Do you doubt it?” replied Smith.\r\n\r\n“But it will be half full of water,” said Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Either it will be perfectly dry,” answered the engineer, “in which\r\ncase we will walk, or it will not be dry, and some means of transport\r\nwill be furnished us.”\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. All went down through the rain to the sea. In these\r\nhours the tide had fallen fifteen feet. The top of the mouth of the\r\nopening rose eight feet above the water, like the arch of a bridge.\r\n\r\nLooking in, the engineer saw a black object floating on the surface. He\r\ndrew it toward him. It was a canoe made of sheet-iron bolted together.\r\nIt was tied to a projecting rock inside the cavern wall. A pair of oars\r\nwere under the seats.\r\n\r\n“Get in,” said Smith.\r\n\r\nThe colonists entered the boat, Neb and Ayrton took the oars, Pencroff\r\nthe tiller, and Smith, in the bows holding the lantern, lit the way.\r\n\r\nThe vault, at first very low, rose suddenly; but the darkness was too\r\ngreat for them to recognize the size of this cavern, its heighth and\r\ndepth. An imposing silence reigned throughout this granite chamber. No\r\nsound, not even the pealing of the thunder penetrated its massive\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the world there are immense caves, a sort of\r\nnatural crypts which date back to the geologic epoch. Some are invaded\r\nby the sea; others contain large lakes within their walls. Such is\r\nFingal’s Cave, in the Island of Staffa; such are the caves of Morgat on\r\nthe Bay of Douarnenez in Brittany; the caves of Bonifacio, in Corsica;\r\nthose of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such is that immense cavern, the\r\nMammoth Cave of Kentucky, which is 500 feet high and more than twenty\r\nmiles long!\r\n\r\nAs to this cavern which the colonists were exploring, did it not reach\r\nto the very centre of the island? For a quarter of an hour the canoe\r\nadvanced under the directions of the engineer. At a certain moment he\r\nsaid:——\r\n\r\n“Go over to the right.”\r\n\r\nThe canoe, taking this direction, brought up beside the wall. The\r\nengineer wished to observe whether the wire continued along this side.\r\n\r\nIt was there fastened to the rock.\r\n\r\n“Forward!” said Smith.\r\n\r\nThe canoe kept on a quarter of an hour longer, and it must have been\r\nhalf a mile from the entrance, when Smith’s voice was heard again.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe canoe stopped, and the colonists saw a brilliant light illuminating\r\nthe enormous crypt, so profoundly hidden in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nThey were now enabled to examine this cavern of whose existence they\r\nhad had no suspicion.\r\n\r\nA vault, supported on basaltic shafts, which might all have been cast\r\nin the same mould, rose to a height of 100 feet. Fantastic arches\r\nsprung at irregular intervals from these columns, which Nature had\r\nplaced here by thousands. They rose to a height of forty or fifty feet,\r\nand the water, in despite of the tumult without, quietly lapped their\r\nbase. The light noticed by the engineer seized upon each prismatic\r\npoint and tipped it with fire; penetrated, so to speak, the walls as if\r\nthey had been diaphanous, and changed into sparkling jewels the least\r\nprojections of the cavern.\r\n\r\nFollowing a phenomenon of reflection, the water reproduced these\r\ndifferent lights upon its surface, so that the canoe seemed to float\r\nbetween two sparkling zones.\r\n\r\nThey had not yet thought of the nature of irradiation projected by the\r\nluminous centre whose rays, straight and clear, were broken on all the\r\nangles and mouldings of the crypt. The white color of this light\r\nbetrayed its origin. It was electric. It was the sun of this cavern.\r\n\r\nOn a sign from Smith, the oars fell again into the water, and the canoe\r\nproceeded towards the luminous fire, which was half a cable’s length\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nIn this place, the sheet of water measured some 300 feet across, and an\r\nenormous basaltic wall, closing all that side, was visible beyond the\r\nluminous centre. The cavern had become much enlarged, and the sea here\r\nformed a little lake. But the vault, the side walls, and those of the\r\napsis, all the prisms, cylinders, cones, were bathed in the electric\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the lake a long fusiform object floated on the surface\r\nof the water, silent, motionless. The light escaped from its sides as\r\nfrom two ovens heated to a white heat. This machine, looking like the\r\nbody of an enormous cetacea, was 250 feet long, and rose ten to twelve\r\nfeet above the water.\r\n\r\nThe canoe approached softly. In the bows stood Smith. He was greatly\r\nexcited. Suddenly he seized the arm of the reporter.\r\n\r\n“It is he! It can be no other than he.” he cried. “He!——”\r\n\r\nThen he fell back upon the seat murmuring a name which Spilett alone\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the reporter knew this name, for it affected him strangely,\r\nand he answered in a hoarse voice:——\r\n\r\n“He! a man outlawed!”\r\n\r\n“The same!” said Smith.\r\n\r\nUnder the engineer’s direction the canoe approached this singular\r\nfloating machine, and came up to it on its left side, from which\r\nescaped a gleam of light through a thick glass.\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions stepped on to the platform. An open hatchway\r\nwas there, down which all descended.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the ladder appeared the waist of the vessel lit up by\r\nelectric light. At the end of the waist was a door, which Smith pushed\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nA richly ornamented library, flooded with light, was rapidly crossed by\r\nthe colonists. Beyond, a large door, also closed, was pushed open by\r\nthe engineer.\r\n\r\nA vast saloon, a sort of museum, in which were arranged all the\r\ntreasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of industry,\r\nappeared before the eyes of the colonists, who seemed to be transported\r\nto the land of dreams.\r\n\r\nExtended upon a rich divan they saw a man, who seemed unaware of their\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThen Smith raised his voice, and, to the extreme surprise of his\r\ncompanions, pronounced these words:——\r\n\r\n“Captain Nemo, you have called us. Here we are.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN NEMO—HIS FIRST WORDS—HISTORY OF A HERO OF LIBERTY—HATRED OF THE\r\nINVADERS—HIS COMPANIONS—THE LIFE UNDER WATER—ALONE—THE LAST REFUGE OF\r\nTHE NAUTILUS—THE MYSTERIOUS GENIUS OF THE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt these words the man arose, and the light shone full upon his face: a\r\nmagnificent head, with abundance of hair thrown back from a high\r\nforehead, a white beard, and an expression of haughtiness.\r\n\r\nThis man stood, resting one hand upon the divan, from which he had\r\nrisen. One could see that a slow disease had broken him down, but his\r\nvoice was still powerful, when he said in English, and in a tone of\r\nextreme surprise:——\r\n\r\n“I have no name, sir!”\r\n\r\n“I know you!” answered Smith.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo looked at the engineer as if he would have annihilated\r\nhim. Then, falling back upon the cushions, he murmured:——\r\n\r\n“After all, what does it matter; I am dying!”\r\n\r\nSmith approached Captain Nemo, and Spilett took his hand, which was hot\r\nwith fever. The others stood respectfully in a corner of the superb\r\nsaloon, which was flooded with light.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo withdrew his hand, and signed to Smith and the reporter to\r\nbe seated.\r\n\r\nAll looked at him with lively emotion. Here was the being whom they had\r\ncalled the “genius of the island,” the being whose intervention had\r\nbeen so efficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed so much. Before\r\ntheir eyes, here where Pencroff and Neb had expected to find some\r\ngodlike creature, was only a man-a dying man!\r\n\r\nBut how did Smith know Captain Nemo? Why had the latter sprung up on\r\nhearing that name pronounced?\r\n\r\nThe Captain had taken his seat upon the divan, and, leaning upon his\r\narm, he regarded the engineer, who was seated near him.\r\n\r\n“You know the name I bore?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I know it as well as I know the name of this admirable submarine\r\napparatus.”\r\n\r\n“The Nautilus,” said the Captain, with a half smile.\r\n\r\n“The Nautilus.”\r\n\r\n“But do you know-do you know, who I am?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“For thirty years I have had no communication with the inhabited world,\r\nfor thirty years have I lived in the depths of the sea, the only place\r\nwhere I have found freedom! Who, now, has betrayed my secret?”\r\n\r\n“A man who never pledged you his word, Captain Nemo, one who,\r\ntherefore, cannot be accused of betraying you.”\r\n\r\n“The Frenchman whom chance threw in my way?”\r\n\r\n“The same.”\r\n\r\n“Then this man and his companions did not perish in the maelstrom into\r\nwhich the Nautilus had been drawn?”\r\n\r\n“They did not, and there has appeared under the title of _Twenty\r\nThousand Leagues Under the Sea_, a work which contains your history.”\r\n\r\n“The history of but a few months of my life, sir,” answered the\r\nCaptain, quickly.\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Smith, “but a few months of that strange life sufficed\r\nto make you known—”\r\n\r\n“As a great criminal, doubtless,” said Captain Nemo, smiling\r\ndisdainfully. “Yes, a revolutionist, a scourge to humanity.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I am unable to judge Captain Nemo,” said Smith, “at least in what\r\nconcerns his past life. I, like the world at large, am ignorant of the\r\nmotives for this strange existence, and I am unable to judge of the\r\neffects without knowing the causes, but what I do know is that a\r\nbeneficent hand has been constantly extended to us since our arrival\r\nhere, that we owe everything to a being good, generous, and powerful,\r\nand that this being, powerful, generous, and good, is you, Captain\r\nNemo!”\r\n\r\n“It is I,” answered the captain, quietly.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and the reporter had risen, the others had drawn near, and\r\nthe gratitude which swelled their hearts would have sought expression\r\nin words and gesture, when Captain Nemo signed to them to be silent,\r\nand in a voice more moved, doubtless, than he wished:—\r\n\r\n“When you have heard me,” he said. And then, in a few short, clear\r\nsentences, he told them the history of his life.\r\n\r\nThe history was brief. Nevertheless, it took all his remaining strength\r\nto finish it. It was evident that he struggled against an extreme\r\nfeebleness. Many times Smith urged him to take some rest, but he shook\r\nhis head, like one who knew that for him there would be no to-morrow,\r\nand when the reporter offered his services—\r\n\r\n“They are useless,” he answered, “my hours are numbered.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo was an Indian prince, the Prince Dakkar, the son of the\r\nrajah of the then independent territory of Bundelkund, and nephew of\r\nthe hero of India, Tippo Saib. His father sent him, when ten years old,\r\nto Europe, where he received a complete education; and it was the\r\nsecret intention of the rajah to have his son able some day to engage\r\nin equal combat with those whom he considered as the oppressors of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFrom ten years of age until he was thirty, the Prince Dakkar, with\r\nsuperior endowments, of high heart and courage, instructed himself in\r\neverything; pushing his investigations in science, literature, and art\r\nto the uttermost limits.\r\n\r\nHe travelled over all Europe. His birth and fortune made his company\r\nmuch sought after, but the seductions of the world possessed no charm\r\nfor him. Young and handsome, he remained serious, gloomy, with an\r\ninsatiable thirst for knowledge, with implacable anger fixed in his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHe hated. He hated the only country where he had never wished to set\r\nfoot, the only nation whose advances he had refused: he hated England\r\nmore and more as he admired her. This Indian summed up in his own\r\nperson all the fierce hatred of the vanquished against the victor. The\r\ninvader is always unable to find grace with the invaded. The son of one\r\nof those sovereigns whose submission to the United Kingdom was only\r\nnominal, the prince of the family of Tippo-Saib, educated in ideas of\r\nreclamation and vengeance, with a deep-seated love for his poetic\r\ncountry weighed down with the chains of England, wished never to place\r\nhis foot on that land, to him accursed, that land to which India owed\r\nher subjection.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Dakkar became an artist, with a lively appreciation of the\r\nmarvels of art; a savant familiar with the sciences; a statesman\r\neducated in European courts. In the eyes of a superficial observer, he\r\npassed, perhaps, for one of those cosmopolites, curious after\r\nknowledge, but disdaining to use it; for one of those opulent\r\ntravellers, high-spirited and platonic, who go all over the world and\r\nare of no one country.\r\n\r\nIt was not so. This artist, this savant, this man was Indian to the\r\nheart, Indian in his desire for vengeance, Indian in the hope which he\r\ncherished of being able some day to re-establish the rights of his\r\ncountry, of driving on the stranger, of making it independent.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a noble Indian\r\nwoman whose heart bled as his did at the woes of their country. He had\r\ntwo children whom he loved. But domestic happiness could not make him\r\nforget the servitude of India. He waited for an opportunity. At length\r\nit came.\r\n\r\nThe English yoke was pressed, perhaps, too heavily upon the Indian\r\npeople. The Prince Dakkar became the mouthpiece of the malcontents. He\r\ninstilled into their spirits all the hatred he felt against the\r\nstrangers. He went over not only the independent portions of the Indian\r\npeninsula, but into those regions directly submitted to the English\r\ncontrol. He recalled to them the grand days of Tippo-Saib, who died\r\nheroically at Seringapatam for the defense of his country.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Sepoy mutiny broke forth. Prince Dakkar was its soul. He\r\norganized that immense uprising. He placed his talents and his wealth\r\nat the service of that cause. He gave himself; he fought in the first\r\nrank; he risked his life as the humblest of those heroes who had risen\r\nto free their country; he was wounded ten times in twenty battles, and\r\nwas unable to find death when the last soldiers of independence fell\r\nbefore the English guns.\r\n\r\nNever had British rule in India been in such danger; and, had the\r\nSepoys received the assistance from without which they had hoped for,\r\nAsia would not to-day, perhaps, be under the dominion of the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nAt that time the name of Prince Dakkar was there illustrious. He never\r\nhid himself, and he fought openly. A price was put upon his head, and\r\nalthough he was not delivered up by any traitor, his father, mother,\r\nwife, and children suffered for him before he knew of the dangers which\r\nthey ran on his account.\r\n\r\nOnce again right fell before might. Civilization never goes backwards,\r\nand her laws are like those of necessity. The Sepoys were vanquished,\r\nand the country of the ancient rajahs fell again under the strict rule\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nPrince Dakkar, unable to die, returned again to his mountains in\r\nBundelkund. There, thenceforward alone, he conceived an immense disgust\r\nagainst all who bore the name of man—a hatred and a horror of the\r\ncivilized world—and wishing to fly from it, he collected the wreck of\r\nhis fortune, gathered together twenty of his most faithful companions,\r\nand one day disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhere did Prince Dakkar seek for that independence which was refused\r\nhim upon the inhabited earth? Under the waters, in the depths of the\r\nseas, where no one could follow him.\r\n\r\nFrom a man of war he became a man of science. On a desert island of the\r\nPacific he established his workshops, and there he constructed a\r\nsubmarine ship after plans of his own. By means which will some day be\r\nknown, he utilized electricity, that incommensurable force, for all the\r\nnecessities of his apparatus as a motor, for lighting and for heat. The\r\nsea, with its infinite treasures, its myriads of fishes, its harvests\r\nof varech and sargassum, its enormous mammifers, and not only all that\r\nnature held, but all that man had lost, amply sufficed for the needs of\r\nthe Prince and his equipage;—and thus he accomplished his heart’s\r\ndesire, to have no further communication with the earth. He named his\r\nsubmarine ship the Nautilus, he called himself Captain Nemo, and he\r\ndisappeared under the seas.\r\n\r\nDuring many years, the Captain visited all the oceans, from one pole to\r\nthe other. Pariah of the earth, he reaped the treasures of the unknown\r\nworlds. The millions lost in Vigo Bay, in 1702, by the Spanish\r\ngalleons, furnished him with an inexhaustible mine of wealth, which he\r\ngave, anonymously, to people fighting for their independence.\r\n\r\nFor years he had had no communication with his kindred, when, during\r\nthe night of the 6th of November, 1866, three men were thrown upon his\r\ndeck. They were a French professor, his servant, and a Canadian\r\nfisherman. These men had been thrown overboard by the shock of the\r\ncollision between the Nautilus and the United States frigate Abraham\r\nLincoln, which had given it chase.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo learned from the Professor that the Nautilus, sometimes\r\ntaken for a gigantic mammifer of the cetacean family, sometimes for a\r\nsubmarine apparatus containing a gang of pirates, was hunted in every\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo could have thrown these three men, whom chance had thrown\r\nacross his mysterious life, into the ocean. He did not do it, he kept\r\nthem prisoners, and, during seven months, they were able to perceive\r\nall the marvels of a voyage of 20,000 leagues under the sea.\r\n\r\nOne day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of\r\nCaptain Nemo’s past life, seized the boat belonging to the Nautilus and\r\nattempted to escape. But just then the Nautilus was upon the coast of\r\nNorway in the eddy of the Maelstrom, and the Captain believed that the\r\nfugitives, caught in its terrible vortex, had been swallowed up in the\r\ngulf. He was unaware that the Frenchman and his companions had been\r\nmiraculously thrown upon the coast, that the fishermen of the Loffodin\r\nIslands had rescued them, and that the Professor, on his return to\r\nFrance, had published a book in which seven months of this strange and\r\nadventurous navigation was narrated.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Captain Nemo continued this mode of life, traversing\r\nthe sea. One by one his companions died and found their rest in the\r\ncoral cemetery at the bottom of the Pacific, and in time Captain Nemo\r\nwas the last survivor of those who had sought refuge in the depths of\r\nthe oceans.\r\n\r\nHe was then sixty years old. As he was alone, it was necessary to take\r\nhis Nautilus to one of those submarine ports which served him in former\r\ndays as a harbor.\r\n\r\nOne of these ports was under Lincoln Island, and was the present asylum\r\nof the Nautilus. For six years the Captain had remained there awaiting\r\nthat death which would reunite him with his companions, when chance\r\nmade him witness to the fall of the balloon which carried the\r\nprisoners. Clothed in his impermeable jacket, he was walking under the\r\nwater, some cables’ lengths from the shore of the islet, when the\r\nengineer was thrown into the sea. A good impulse moved Captain Nemo—and\r\nhe saved Cyrus Smith.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of these five castaways he wished to go from them, but\r\nhis port of refuge was closed. Some volcanic action had raised up the\r\nbasalt so that the Nautilus could not cross the entrance to the crypt,\r\nalthough there was still sufficient water for a boat of light draught.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo, therefore, remained and watched these men, thrown without\r\nresources upon a desert island, but he did not wish to be seen. Little\r\nby little, as he saw their honest, energetic lives, how they were bound\r\ntogether in fraternal amity, he interested himself in their efforts. In\r\nspite of himself, he found out all the secrets of their existence.\r\nClothed in his impermeable jacket, he could easily reach the bottom of\r\nthe well in Granite House, and climbing by the projections of the rock\r\nto its mouth, he heard the colonists talk of their past and discuss\r\ntheir present and future. He learned from them of the struggle of\r\nAmerica against itself, for the abolition of slavery. Yes! these men\r\nwere worthy to reconcile Captain Nemo with that humanity which they\r\nrepresented so honestly on the island.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo had saved Smith. It was he who had led the dog to the\r\nChimneys, who threw Top out of the water, who stranded the box of\r\nuseful articles on Jetsam Point, who brought the canoe down the Mercy,\r\nwho threw the cord from Granite House, when it was attacked by the\r\nmonkeys, who made known the presence of Ayrton on Tabor Island by means\r\nof the paper inclosed in the bottle, who blew up the brig by means of a\r\ntorpedo, who saved Herbert from certain death by bringing the quinine,\r\nwho, finally, killed the convicts by those electric balls which he\r\nemployed in his submarine hunting excursions. Thus was explained all\r\nthose seemingly supernatural incidents, which, all of them, attested\r\nthe generosity and the power of the Captain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this intense misanthrope thirsted to do good. He had some\r\nuseful advice to give to his proteges, and moreover, feeling the\r\napproach of death, he had summoned, as we have seen, the colonists from\r\nGranite House, by means of the wire which reached from the corral to\r\nthe Nautilus. Perhaps he would not have done it, had he thought that\r\nSmith knew enough of his history to call him by his name of Nemo.\r\n\r\nThe Captain finished the recital of his life, and then Smith spoke. He\r\nrecalled all the instances of the salutary influences exercised over\r\nthe colonists, and then, in the name of his companions, and in his own,\r\nhe thanked this generous being for all that he had done.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Nemo had never dreamed of asking any return for his\r\nservices. One last thought agitated his spirit, and, before taking the\r\nhand which the engineer held out to him, he said:—\r\n\r\n“Now, sir, you know my life, judge of it!”\r\n\r\nIn speaking thus, the Captain evidently alluded to an incident of a\r\nserious nature which had been witnessed by the three strangers on the\r\nNautilus—an incident which the French professor had necessarily\r\nrecounted in his book, an incident whose very recital was terrible.\r\n\r\nIn brief, some days before the flight of the professor and his\r\ncompanions, the Nautilus, pursued by a frigate in the North Atlantic,\r\nhad rushed upon her like a battering-ram, and sunk her without mercy.\r\n\r\nSmith, understanding this allusion, made no answer.\r\n\r\n“It was an English frigate, sir!” cried Captain Nemo, becoming for the\r\nmoment Prince Dakkar, “an English frigate, you understand! She attacked\r\nme! I was shut in, in a narrow and shallow bay; I had to pass out,\r\nand—I passed!”\r\n\r\nThen, speaking with more calmness:—\r\n\r\n“I had right and justice on my side,” he added. “I did good when I\r\ncould, and evil when I must. All justice is not in forgiveness.”\r\n\r\nSome moments of silence followed this response, and Captain Nemo asked\r\nagain:—\r\n\r\n“What do you think of me?”\r\n\r\nSmith took the hand of the Captain, and answered him in a grave voice:—\r\n\r\n“Captain, your mistake has been in believing that you could bring back\r\nthe old order of things, and you have struggled against necessary\r\nprogress. It was one of those errors which some of us admire, others\r\nblame, but of which God alone can judge, and which the human mind\r\nexonerates. We can disagree with one who misleads himself in an\r\nintention which he believes laudable, and at the same time esteem him.\r\nYour error is of a kind which does not preclude admiration, and your\r\nname has nothing to fear from the judgment of history. She loves heroic\r\nfollies, though she condemns the results which follow.”\r\n\r\nThe breast of Captain Nemo heaved; he raised his hand towards heaven.\r\n\r\n“Was I wrong, or was I right?” he murmured.\r\n\r\nSmith continued:—\r\n\r\n“All great actions return to God, from whom they came! Captain Nemo,\r\nthe worthy men here, whom you have succored, will always weep for you!”\r\n\r\nHerbert approached him. He knelt down and took the hand of the captain,\r\nand kissed it.\r\n\r\nA tear glistened in the eye of the dying man.\r\n\r\n“My child,” he said, “bless you!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST HOURS OF CAPTAIN NEMO—HIS DYING WISHES—A SOUVENIR FOR HIS\r\nFRIENDS—HIS TOMB—SOME COUNSEL TO THE COLONISTS—THE SUPREME MOMENT—AT\r\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was morning, though no ray of daylight penetrated the vault. The\r\nsea, at this moment high, covered the outlet. But the artificial light\r\nescaping in long rays from the sides of the Nautilus, had not\r\ndiminished, and the sheet of water around the vessel glowed\r\nresplendent.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo, overcome by an extreme fatigue, fell back upon the divan.\r\nThey did not dream of transporting him to Granite House, as he had\r\nshown a wish to remain among the priceless treasures of the Nautilus,\r\nawaiting that death which could not be long in coming.\r\n\r\nSmith and Spilett observed with great attention his prostration. They\r\nsaw that he was slowly sinking. His strength, formerly so great, was\r\nalmost gone, and his body was but a frail envelope for the spirit about\r\nescaping. All life was concentrated at the heart and brain.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and the reporter consulted together in low tones. Could\r\nthey do anything for the dying man? Could they, if not save him, at\r\nleast prolong his life for a few days? He himself had said that there\r\nwas no remedy, and he awaited death calmly and without fear.\r\n\r\n“We can do nothing,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“What is he dying of?” asked Pencroff.\r\n\r\n“Of exhaustion,” answered the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Supposing we take him out into the open air, into the sunlight,\r\nperhaps he would revive?”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff,” responded the engineer, “there is nothing to do.\r\nMoreover, Captain Nemo would not be willing to leave here. He has lived\r\non the Nautilus for thirty years, and on the Nautilus he wishes to\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\nDoubtless Captain Nemo heard Smith’s words, for, raising himself up a\r\nlittle, and speaking in a feeble but intelligible voice, he said:—\r\n\r\n“You are right. I wish to die here. And I have a request to make.”\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions had gathered round the divan, and they\r\narranged the cushions so that the dying man was more comfortably\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nThey saw that his gaze was fixed upon the marvels of the saloon, lit up\r\nby the rays of electric light sifting through the arabesques of the\r\nluminous ceiling. He looked upon the pictures, those _chefs d’œuvre_ of\r\nItalian, Flemish, French, and Spanish masters, which hung on the\r\ntapestried walls, upon the marbles and bronzes, upon the magnificent\r\norgan at the opposite end of the saloon, upon the glasses arranged\r\naround a central vase in which were disposed the rarest products of the\r\nseas, marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls of an inappreciable\r\nvalue, and at length his attention was fixed upon this device, the\r\ndevice of the Nautilus inscribed upon the front of this museum:—\r\n\r\nMOBILIS IN MOBILI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if he wished to caress with his regard, one last time,\r\nthose _chefs d’oeuvre_ of art and nature which had been ever visible to\r\nhim in the years of his sojourn in the depths of the sea!\r\n\r\nSmith respected Captain Nemo’s silence. He waited for him to speak.\r\n\r\nAfter some moments, during which passed before him, doubtless, his\r\nwhole life, Cap-Nemo turned to the colonists and said:—\r\n\r\n“You wish to do me a favor?”\r\n\r\n“Captain, we would give our lives to prolong yours!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, promise me that you will execute my last wishes, and I\r\nwill be repaid for all that I have done for you.”\r\n\r\n“We promise,” answered Smith, speaking for his companions and himself.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” said the Captain, “to-morrow I will be dead.”\r\n\r\nHe made a sign to Herbert, who was about to protest.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow I will be dead, and I wish for no other tomb than the\r\nNautilus. It is my coffin! All my friends rest at the bottom of the\r\nsea, and I wish to rest there also.”\r\n\r\nA profound silence followed the words of Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\n“Attend to what I say,” he continued. “The Nautilus is imprisoned in\r\nthis grotto. But if she cannot leave this prison, she can at least sink\r\nherself in the abyss, which will cover her and guard my mortal\r\nremains.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists listened religiously to the words of the dying man.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, after I am dead, Mr. Smith,” continued the Captain, “you\r\nand your companions will leave the Nautilus, all of whose riches are to\r\ndisappear with me. One single remembrance of Prince Dakkar, whose\r\nhistory you now know, will remain to you. That coffer, there, encloses\r\ndiamonds worth many millions, most of them souvenirs of the time when,\r\na husband and father, I almost believed in happiness, and a collection\r\nof pearls gathered by my friends and myself from the bottom of the sea.\r\nWith this treasure, you will be able, some time, to accomplish good. In\r\nyour hands and those of your companions, Mr. Smith, wealth will not be\r\ndangerous. I shall be ever present with you in your works.”\r\n\r\nAfter some moments of rest, necessitated by his extreme feebleness,\r\nCaptain Nemo continued as follows:—\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, you will take this coffer, you will leave this saloon, and\r\nclose the door; then you will ascend to the platform of the Nautilus\r\nand you will bolt down the hatchway.”\r\n\r\n“We will do it, sir,” replied Smith.\r\n\r\n“Very well. You will then embark in the boat which brought you here.\r\nBut, before abandoning the Nautilus, go to the stern, and there, open\r\ntwo large cocks which you will find at the water-line. The water will\r\npenetrate and the Nautilus will sink beneath the waves and rest upon\r\nthe bottom of the abyss.”\r\n\r\nThen, upon a gesture from Smith, the Captain added:—\r\n\r\n“Fear nothing! you will only be burying the dead!”\r\n\r\nNeither Smith nor his companions could say a word to Captain Nemo.\r\nThese were his last wishes, and they had nothing else to do but obey\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“I have your promise?” asked Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\n“You have it, sir,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\nThe Captain made a sign thanking them, and then motioned to be left\r\nalone for a few hours. Spilett insisted on remaining with him, in case\r\nof an emergency, but the other refused, saying:—\r\n\r\n“I will live till morning, sir.”\r\n\r\nAll left the salon, passing through the library, the dining-room, and\r\nreached the forward part of the vessel, where the electric apparatus,\r\nfurnishing heat, light, and motive power to the Nautilus was placed.\r\n\r\nThe Nautilus was a _chef-d’oeuvre_ containing _chefs-d’oeuvre_, which\r\nfilled the engineer with amazement.\r\n\r\nThe colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet\r\nabove the water. Then they saw a thick lenticular glass closing up a\r\nsort of bull’s-eye, through which penetrated a ray of light. Behind\r\nthis bull’s-eye was the wheel-house, where the steersman stood when\r\ndirecting the Nautilus under the sea, by means of the electric light.\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions stood here in silence, impressed by what they\r\nsaw, and what they had heard, and their hearts bled to think that he,\r\ntheir protector, whose arm had been so often raised to aid them, would\r\nsoon be counted among the dead.\r\n\r\nWhatever would be the judgment of posterity upon this, so to say,\r\nextra-human existence, Prince Dakkar would always remain one of those\r\nstrange characters who cannot be forgotten.\r\n\r\n“What a man!” said Pencroff. “Is it credible that he has lived so at\r\nthe bottom of the ocean! And to think that he has not found rest even\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n“The Nautilus,” observed Ayrton, “would, perhaps, have served us to\r\nleave Lincoln Island and gain some inhabited country.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand devils!” cried Pencroff. “You couldn’t get me to steer such\r\na craft. To sail over the seas is all very well, but under the\r\nseas,—no, sir!”\r\n\r\n“I think, Pencroff,” said the reporter, “that it would be easy to\r\nmanage a submarine apparatus like the Nautilus, and that we would soon\r\nget accustomed to it. No storms, no boarding to fear. At some little\r\ndistance under the waves the waters are as calm as those of a lake.”\r\n\r\n“That’s likely enough,” answered the sailor, “but give me a stiff\r\nbreeze and a well rigged ship. A ship is made to go on the water and\r\nnot under it.”\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said the engineer, “it is useless, at least as far as the\r\nNautilus is concerned, to discuss this question of submarine vessels.\r\nThe Nautilus is not ours, and we have no right to dispose of it. It\r\ncould not, moreover, serve us under any circumstances. Aside from the\r\nfact that it cannot get out of this cavern, Captain Nemo wishes it to\r\nbe engulfed with him after his death. His wish is law, and we will obey\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions, after talking for a while longer, descended\r\ninto the interior of the Nautilus. There they ate some food and\r\nreturned to the salon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo had recovered from his prostration, and his eyes had\r\nregained their brilliancy. They saw a smile upon his lips.\r\n\r\nThe colonists approached him. “Sirs,” said the Captain, “you are brave\r\nmen, and good and honest. You have given yourselves up to the common\r\ncause. I have often watched you. I have loved you. I do love you!—Give\r\nme your hand, Mr. Smith.”\r\n\r\nSmith gave his hand to the Captain, who pressed it affectionately.\r\n\r\n“That is well!” he murmured. Then he added:—\r\n\r\n“But I have said enough about myself. I wish to speak of yourselves and\r\nof Lincoln Island, on which you have found refuge. You want to leave\r\nit?”.\r\n\r\n“To come back again!” said Pencroff eagerly.\r\n\r\n“To return?—Oh! yes, Pencroff,” answered the Captain, smiling, “I know\r\nhow much you love this island. It has been improved by your care, and\r\nit is, indeed, yours.”\r\n\r\n“Our project, Captain,” added Smith, “would be to make it over to the\r\nUnited States, and to establish a station, which would be well situated\r\nhere in this part of the Pacific.”\r\n\r\n“You think of your country,” replied the Captain. “You work for her\r\nprosperity, for her glory. You are right. The Fatherland! It is there\r\nwe wish to return! It is there we wish to die! And I, I die far from\r\neverything that I have loved!”\r\n\r\n“Have you no last wish to have executed,” asked the engineer earnestly,\r\n“no souvenir to send to those friends you left in the mountains of\r\nIndia?”\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Smith, I have no friends! I am the last of my race—and I die\r\nlong after those whom I have known.—But to return to yourselves.\r\nSolitude, isolation are sorrowful things, beyond human endurance. I die\r\nfrom having believed that man could live alone!—You wish to leave\r\nLincoln Island and to return to your country. I know that these\r\nwretches have destroyed your boat-”\r\n\r\n“We are building a ship,” said Spilett, “a ship large enough to take us\r\nto the nearest country; but if sooner or later we leave the island, we\r\nwill come back again. Too many associations attach us to the place, for\r\nus ever to forget it.”\r\n\r\n“Here we met Captain Nemo,” said Smith.\r\n\r\n“Here only will we find the perfect remembrance of you!” added\r\nHerbert.”\r\n\r\n“It is here that I will rest in an eternal sleep, if—” answered the\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, and, instead of finishing his sentence, said:—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smith, I wish to speak with you,—with you alone.”\r\n\r\nThe companions of the engineer retired, and Smith remained for some\r\ntime alone with Captain Nemo. He soon called back his friends, but said\r\nnothing to them of the secrets which the dying prince had confided to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSpilett observed the Captain with extreme attention. He was evidently\r\nliving by the strength of his will, which could not long hold out\r\nagainst his physical weakness.\r\n\r\nThe day ended without any change manifesting itself. The colonists did\r\nnot leave the Nautilus. Night came, although unseen in this crypt.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nemo did not suffer pain, but sunk slowly. His noble face, pale\r\nby the approach of death, was perfectly calm. Now and then he spoke,\r\nincoherently, of events in his strange existence.—All saw that life was\r\nretreating. His feet and hands were already cold.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, he spoke a word to the colonists who were about him, and\r\nhe looked upon them with that smile which remained when he was no more.\r\n\r\nAt last, just after midnight, Captain Nemo made a supreme effort, and\r\ncrossed his arms upon his breast, as if he wished to die in that\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nTowards 1 o’clock all the life that was left was concentrated in his\r\nexpression. One last spark burned in that eye which had formerly\r\nflashed fire! Then, murmuring these words, “God and Fatherland,” he\r\nexpired quietly.\r\n\r\nSmith, stooping down, closed the eyes of him who had been Prince\r\nDakkar, who was no more even Captain Nemo.\r\n\r\nHerbert and Pencroff wept. Ayrton wiped away a furtive tear. Neb was on\r\nhis knees near the reporter, who was immobile as a statue.\r\n\r\nSmith raising his hand above the head of the dead man:—\r\n\r\n“May God receive his soul!” he said, and then, turning towards his\r\nfriends, he added:—\r\n\r\n“Let us pray for him whom we have lost!”\r\n\r\n\r\nSome hours later, the colonists, in fulfillment of their promise,\r\ncarried out the last wishes of the dead.\r\n\r\nThey left the Nautilus, taking with them the sole souvenir of their\r\nbenefactor, the coffer containing a hundred fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous salon, still flooded with light, was carefully closed.\r\nThe cover to the hatchway was bolted down in such a manner that not a\r\ndrop of water could penetrate to the inner chambers of the Nautilus.\r\nThen the colonists entered the boat, which was moored beside the\r\nsubmarine ship.\r\n\r\nThe boat was taken to the stern. There, at the water-line, they opened\r\nthe two large cocks which communicated with the reservoirs designed to\r\nimmerse the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the Nautilus, sinking\r\nslowly, disappeared beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nBut the colonists were able still to follow her coarse through the\r\nlower depths. Her strong light lit up the transparent waters, as the\r\ncrypt became darkened. Then at length the vast effusion of electric\r\neffulgence was effaced, and the Nautilus, the tomb of Captain Nemo,\r\nrested upon the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLONISTS—RENEWAL OF WORK—THE 1ST OF JANUARY,\r\n1869—A SMOKE FROM THE VOLCANO—SYMPTOMS OF AN ERUPTION AYRTON AND SMITH\r\nAT THE CORRAL—EXPLORATION OF THE CRYPT DAKKAR —WHAT CAPTAIN NEMO HAD\r\nSAID TO THE ENGINEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early morning the colonists reached the entrance of the cavern,\r\nwhich they called Crypt Dakkar, in remembrance of Captain Nemo. The\r\ntide was low, and they easily passed under the archway, whose piers\r\nwere washed by the waves.\r\n\r\nThe iron boat could remain in this place without danger from the sea;\r\nbut as additional precaution they drew it up on a little beach on one\r\nside of the crypt.\r\n\r\nThe storm had ceased during the night. The last mutterings of the\r\nthunder were dying away in the west. It was not raining, although the\r\nsky was still clouded. In short, this month of October, the beginning\r\nof the southern spring, did not come in good fashion, and the wind had\r\na tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another, so that\r\nit was impossible to say what the weather would be.\r\n\r\nSmith and his companions, on leaving Crypt Dakkar, went towards the\r\ncorral. On the way Neb and Herbert took care to take up the wire which\r\nhad been stretched by Captain Nemo, as it might be useful in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhile walking the colonists spoke but little. The incidents of this\r\nnight had made a vivid impression upon them. This unknown, whose\r\ninfluence had protected them so well, this man whom they imagined a\r\ngenii, Captain Nemo, was no more. His Nautilus and himself were buried\r\nin the depths of the abyss. It seemed to each one of them that they\r\nwere more isolated than before. They were, so to speak, accustomed to\r\ncount upon this powerful intervention which to-day was wanting, and\r\nSpilett, and even Smith, did not escape this feeling. So, without\r\nspeaking, they followed the road to the corral.\r\n\r\nBy 9 o’clock the colonists were in Granite House again.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed that the construction of the ship should be pushed\r\nforward as rapidly as possible, and Smith gave the work more of his\r\ntime and care than ever before. They did not know what the future might\r\nbring forth, and it would be a guarantee of safety for them to have a\r\nstrong vessel, able to stand rough weather, and large enough to carry\r\nthem, if need be, a long distance. If, when it was finished, the\r\ncolonists decided not to leave the island they could at least make the\r\nvoyage to Tabor Island and leave a notice there. This was an\r\nindispensable precaution in case the Scotch yacht returned to these\r\nseas, and it must on no account be neglected.\r\n\r\nThe work was undertaken at once. All worked at it without ceasing,\r\nexcept to prosecute other necessary work. It was important to have the\r\nnew ship finished in five months, if they wished to make the voyage to\r\nTabor Island before the equinoxial storms would render it\r\nimpracticable. All the sails of the Speedy had been saved, so that they\r\nneed not trouble themselves about making rigging.\r\n\r\nThe year ended in the midst of this work. At the end of two months and\r\na half the ribs had been put in place and the planking began, so that\r\nthey were able to see that Smith’s plans were excellent. Pencroff\r\nworked with ardor, and always grumbled when any of the others left off\r\nwork to go hunting. It was, nevertheless, necessary to lay in a stock\r\nof provisions for the approaching winter. But that made no difference.\r\nThe honest sailor was unhappy unless every one was at work in the\r\nship-yard. At these times he grumbled and did—he was so put out—the\r\nwork of half a dozen men.\r\n\r\nAll this summer season was bad. The heat was overpowering, and the\r\natmosphere, charged with electricity, discharged itself in violent\r\nstorms. It was seldom that the distant muttering of the thunder was\r\nunheard. It was like a dull, but permanent murmur, such as is produced\r\nin the equatorial regions of the globe.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1869, a terrific storm burst over the island,\r\nand the lightning struck in many places. Tall trees were shattered, and\r\namong them was one of the enormous micocouliers which shaded the\r\npoultry-yard. Had this meteoric storm any relation to the phenomena\r\nwhich were occurring In the bowels of the earth? Was there a sort of\r\nconnection between the disturbances in the air and those in the\r\ninterior of the globe. Smith believed it to be so, since the\r\ndevelopment of these storms was marked by a recrudescence of the\r\nvolcanic symptoms.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of January, Herbert, who had gone at daybreak to Prospect\r\nPlateau to saddle one of the onagers, saw an immense black cloud\r\nrolling out from the summit of the volcano.\r\n\r\nHerbert hastened to inform the others, who came at once to look at the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Pencroff, “it is not vapor this time! It seems to me that\r\nthe giant is not content to breathe, he must smoke!”\r\n\r\nThe image employed by the sailor expressed with exactness the change\r\nwhich had taken place at the mouth of the volcano. For three months the\r\ncrater had been emitting vapors more or less intense, but there had\r\nbeen no ebullition of mineral matters. This time, instead of vapors, a\r\nthick column of smoke rose, like an immense mushroom, above the summit\r\nof the mountain.\r\n\r\n“The chimney is on fire!” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“And we cannot put it out!” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“It would be well to sweep the volcanoes,” said Neb, in good earnest.\r\n\r\n“All right, Neb,” said Pencroff, laughing. “Will you undertake the\r\njob?”\r\n\r\nSmith looked attentively at the thick smoke, and at the same time he\r\nlistened as if he expected to detect some distant rumbling. Then,\r\nturning towards his companions, who were at some little distance, he\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n“In truth, my friends, it cannot be denied that an important change has\r\ntaken place. The volcanic matters are not only in a state of\r\nebullition, they have taken fire, and, without doubt, we are threatened\r\nwith an eruption!”\r\n\r\n“Very well, sir; we will witness this eruption,” cried Pencroff, “and\r\nwe will applaud it if it is a success! I don’t think that anything over\r\nthere need worry us!”\r\n\r\n“No, Pencroff,” answered Smith, “for the old course of the lava is\r\nopen, and, thanks to its position, the crater has heretofore discharged\r\ntowards the north. Nevertheless—”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, since there is nothing to be gained by an eruption, it\r\nwould be better not to have it,” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” replied the sailor. “There may be some useful and precious\r\nmatter in the volcano, which it will be good enough to throw up, which\r\nwill be advantageous for us!”\r\n\r\nSmith shook his head, as a man who anticipated nothing good from this\r\nphenomenon. He did not think so lightly of the consequences of an\r\neruption. If the lava, on account of the position of the crater, did\r\nnot menace the wooded and cultivated portions of the island, other\r\ncomplications might arise. Eruptions are often accompanied by\r\nearthquakes, and an island formed, like Lincoln Island, of such\r\ndifferent materials: basalt on one side, granite on another, lavas to\r\nthe north, a mixed soil inland, material which, therefore, could not be\r\nsolidly bound together, ran the risk of being torn asunder. If,\r\ntherefore, the outpouring of volcanic substances did not threaten\r\nserious results, any movement in the framework upholding the island\r\nmight be followed by the gravest consequences.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Ayrton, who was kneeling down, with his ear to\r\nthe ground, “it seems to me that I hear a noise, like the rattling of a\r\nwagon, loaded with iron bars.”\r\n\r\nThe colonists listened carefully, and were convinced that Ayrton was\r\nnot mistaken. With the rumbling mingled subterranean roaring, making a\r\nsort of “rinfordzando,” which died away slowly, as if from some violent\r\ncleavage in the interior of the globe. But no detonation was heard, and\r\nit was fair to conclude that the smoke and vapor found a free passage\r\nthrough the central chimney, and, if the escape-pipe was sufficiently\r\nlarge, no explosion need be feared.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Pencroff at length, “shall we not go back to work? Let\r\nMount Franklin smoke, brawl, moan, and vomit fire and flames as much as\r\nit chooses, but that is no excuse for us to quit work! Come, Ayrton,\r\nNeb, all of you, we want all hands to-day! I want our new Good Luck—we\r\nwill keep the name, will we not?—to be moored in Balloon Harbor before\r\ntwo months are passed! So there is not an hour to be lost!”\r\n\r\nAll the colonists went down to the shipyard and worked steadily all day\r\nwithout giving too much thought to the volcano, which could not be seen\r\nfrom the beach before Granite House. But once or twice heavy shadows\r\nobscured the sunlight, and, as the was day perfectly clear, it was\r\nevident that thick clouds of smoke were passing between the sun’s disc\r\nand the island. Smith and Spilett noticed these sombre voyagers, and\r\ntalked of the progress that the volcanic phenomenon was making, but\r\nthey did not cease work. It was, moreover, of great importance, in\r\nevery sense, that the ship should be finished with as little delay as\r\npossible. In the presence of events which might happen, the security of\r\nthe colonists would be better assured. Who could say but that this ship\r\nmight not, some day, be their sole refuge?\r\n\r\nThat evening, after supper, Smith, Spilett, and Herbert climbed to the\r\nplateau. It was already dark, and they would be able to distinguish\r\nwhether flames or incandescent matter was mingled with the smoke and\r\nvapor of the volcano.\r\n\r\n“The crater is on fire!” cried Herbert, who, more active than his\r\ncompanions, had reached the plateau the first.\r\n\r\nMount Franklin, six miles distant, appeared like a gigantic torch, with\r\nfuliginous flames twisting about its summit. So much smoke, such\r\nquantities of scoriæ and cinders, perhaps, were mingled with the\r\nflames, that their light did not glare upon the shades of night. But a\r\nsort of dull yellow glow spread over the island, making dimly visible\r\nthe higher masses of forest. Enormous clouds obscured the heavens,\r\nbetween which glittered a few stars.\r\n\r\n“The progress is rapid,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\n“It is not astonishing,” answered the reporter. “The volcano has been\r\nawake for some time already. You remember, Cyrus, that the first vapors\r\nappeared about the time we were searching the mountain for the retreat\r\nof Captain Nemo. That was, if I am not mistaken, about the 15th of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n“Yes” replied Herbert, “two months and a half ago.”\r\n\r\n“The subterranean fires have been brooding for ten weeks,” continued\r\nSpilett, “and it is not astonishing that they develop now with this\r\nviolence.”\r\n\r\n“Do not you feel certain vibrations in the ground?” asked Smith.\r\n\r\n“I think so,” replied Spilett, “but an earthquake—”\r\n\r\n“I did not say that we were menaced by an earthquake,” said Smith, “and\r\nHeaven preserve us from one! No. These vibrations are due to the\r\neffervesence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is nothing\r\nmore than the covering of a boiler, and you know how the covering of a\r\nboiler, under pressure, vibrates like a sonorous plate. That is what is\r\nhappening at this moment.”\r\n\r\n“What magnificent flames!” cried Herbert, as a sheaf of fire shot up,\r\nunobscured by the vapors, from the crater. From its midst luminous\r\nfragments and bright scintillations were thrown in every direction.\r\nSome of them pierced the dome of smoke, leaving behind them a perfect\r\ncloud of incandescent dust. This outpouring was accompanied by rapid\r\ndetonations like the discharge of a battery of mitrailleuses.\r\n\r\nSmith, the reporter, and the lad, after having passed an hour on\r\nProspect Plateau, returned to Granite House. The engineer was pensive,\r\nand so much preoccupied that Spilett asked him if he anticipated any\r\nnear danger.\r\n\r\n“Yes and no,” responded Smith.\r\n\r\n“But the worst that could happen,” said the reporter, “would be an\r\nearthquake, which would overthrow the island. And I don’t think that is\r\nto be feared, since the vapors and lava have a free passage of escape.”\r\n\r\n“I do not fear an earthquake,” answered Smith, “of the ordinary kind,\r\nsuch as are brought about by the expansion of subterranean vapors. But\r\nother causes may bring about great disaster.”\r\n\r\n“For example?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know exactly—I must see—I must visit the mountain. In a few\r\ndays I shall have made up my mind.”\r\n\r\nSpilett asked no further questions, and soon, notwithstanding the\r\nincreased violence of the volcano, the inhabitants of Granite House\r\nslept soundly.\r\n\r\nThree days passed, the 4th 5th, and 6th of January, during which they\r\nworked on the ship, and, without explaining himself further, the\r\nengineer hastened the work as much as possible. Mount Franklin was\r\ncovered with a sinister cloud, and with the flames vomited forth\r\nincandescent rocks, some of which fell back into the crater. This made\r\nPencroff, who wished to look upon the phenomenon from an amusing side,\r\nsay—\r\n\r\n“Look! The giant plays at cup and ball! He is a juggler.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the matters vomited forth fell back into the abyss, and it\r\nseemed as if the lavas, swollen by the interior pressure, had not yet\r\nrisen to the mouth of the crater. At least, the fracture on the\r\nnortheast, which was partly visible, did not pour forth any torrent on\r\nthe western side of the mountain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however pressing the ship-building, other cares required the\r\nattention of the colonists in different parts of the island. First of\r\nall, they must go to the corral, where the moufflons and goats were\r\nenclosed, and renew the provisions for these animals. It was,\r\ntherefore, agreed that Ayrton should go there the next day, and, as it\r\nwas customary for but one to do this work, the others were surprised to\r\nhear the engineer say to Ayrton:——\r\n\r\n“As you are going to the corral to-morrow, I will go with you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Mr. Smith!” cried the sailor, “our time is very limited, and, if\r\nyou go off in this way, we lose just that much help!”\r\n\r\n“We will return the next day,” answered Smith, “but I must go to the\r\ncorral—I wish to see about this eruption.”\r\n\r\n“Eruption! Eruption!” answered Pencroff, with a dissatisfied air. “What\r\nis there important about this eruption? It don’t bother me!”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sailor’s protest, the exploration was decided upon\r\nfor the next day. Herbert wanted to go with Smith, but he did not wish\r\nto annoy Pencroff by absenting himself. So, early the next morning,\r\nSmith and Ayrton started off with the wagon and onagers.\r\n\r\nOver the forest hung huge clouds constantly supplied from Mount\r\nFranklin with fuliginous matter. They were evidently composed of\r\nheterogeneous substances. It was not altogether the smoke from the\r\nvolcano that made them so heavy and opaque. Scoriæ in a state of\r\npowder, pulverized puzzolan and grey cinder as fine as the finest\r\nfecula, were held in suspension in their thick folds. These cinders\r\nremain in air, sometimes, for months at a time. After the eruption of\r\n1783, in Iceland, for more than a year the atmosphere was so charged\r\nwith volcanic powder that the sun’s rays were scarcely visible.\r\n\r\nUsually, however, these pulverized matters fall to the earth at once,\r\nand it was so in this instance. Smith and Ayrton had hardly reached the\r\ncorral, when a sort of black cloud, like fine gunpowder, fell, and\r\ninstantly modified the whole aspect of the ground. Trees, fields,\r\neverything was covered with a coating several fingers deep. But, most\r\nfortunately, the wind was from the northeast, and the greater part of\r\nthe cloud was carried off to sea.\r\n\r\n“That is very curious,” said Ayrton.\r\n\r\n“It is very serious,” answered Smith. This puzzolan, this pulverized\r\npumice stone, all this mineral dust in short, shows how deep-seated is\r\nthe commotion in the volcano.\r\n\r\n“But there is nothing to be done.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, but to observe the progress of the phenomenon. Employ\r\nyourself, Ayrton, at the corral, and meanwhile I will go up to the\r\nsources of Red Creek and examine the state of the mountain on its\r\nwestern side. Then——”\r\n\r\n“Then, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Then we will make a visit to Crypt Dakkar—I wish to see—Well, I will\r\ncome back for you in a couple of hours.”\r\n\r\nAyrton went into the corral, and while waiting for the return of the\r\nengineer occupied himself with the moufflons and goats, which showed a\r\ncertain uneasiness before these first symptoms of an eruption.\r\n\r\nMeantime Smith had ventured to climb the eastern spurs of the mountain,\r\nand he arrived at the place where his companions had discovered the\r\nsulphur spring on their first exploration.\r\n\r\nHow everything was changed! Instead of a single column of smoke, he\r\ncounted thirteen escaping from the ground as if thrust upward by a\r\npiston. It was evident that the crust of earth was subjected in this\r\nplace to a frightful pressure. The atmosphere was saturated with gases\r\nand aqueous vapors. Smith felt the volcanic tufa, the pulverulent\r\ncinders hardened by time, trembling beneath him, but he did not yet see\r\nany traces of fresh lava.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with the western slope of the mountain. Smoke and\r\nflames escaped from the crater; a hail of scoriæ fell upon the soil;\r\nbut no lava flowed from the gullet of the crater, which was another\r\nproof that the volcanic matter had not attained the upper orifice of\r\nthe central chimney.\r\n\r\n“And I would be better satisfied if they had!” said Smith to himself.\r\n“At least I would be certain that the lavas had taken their accustomed\r\nroute. Who knows if they may not burst forth from some new mouth? But\r\nthat is not the danger! Captain Nemo has well foreseen it! No! the\r\ndanger is not there!”\r\n\r\nSmith went forward as far as the enormous causeway, whose prolongation\r\nenframed Shark Gulf. Here he was able to examine the ancient lava\r\nmarks. There could be no doubt that the last eruption had been at a far\r\ndistant epoch.\r\n\r\nThen he returned, listening to the subterranean rumblings, which\r\nsounded like continuous thunder, and by 9 o’clock he was at the corral.\r\n\r\nAyrton was waiting for him.\r\n\r\n“The animals are attended to, sir,” said he.\r\n\r\n“All right, Ayrton.”\r\n\r\n“They seem to be restless, Mr. Smith.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is their instinct, which does not mislead them.”\r\n\r\n“When you are ready—”\r\n\r\n“Take a lantern and tinder, Ayrton, and let us go.”\r\n\r\nAyrton did as he was told. The onagers had been unharnessed and placed\r\nin the corral, and Smith, leading, took the route to the coast.\r\n\r\nThey walked over a soil covered with the pulverulent matter which had\r\nfallen from the clouds. No animal appeared. Even the birds had flown\r\naway. Sometimes a breeze passed laden with cinders, and the two\r\ncolonists, caught in the cloud, were unable to see. They had to place\r\nhandkerchiefs over their eyes and nostrils or they would have been\r\nblinded and suffocated.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances they could not march rapidly. The air was\r\nheavy, as if all the oxygen had been burned out of it, making it unfit\r\nto breathe. Every now and then they had to stop, and it was after 10\r\no’clock when the engineer and his companion reached the summit of the\r\nenormous heap of basaltic and porphyrytic rocks which formed the\r\nnorthwest coast of the island.\r\n\r\nThey began to go down this abrupt descent, following the detestable\r\nroad, which, during that stormy night had led them to Crypt Dakkar. By\r\ndaylight this descent was less perilous, and, moreover, the covering of\r\ncinders gave a firmer foothold to the slippery rocks.\r\n\r\nThe projection was soon attained, and, as the tide was low, Smith and\r\nAyrton found the opening to the crypt without any difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Is the boat there?” asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered Ayrton, drawing the boat towards him.\r\n\r\n“Let us get in, then, Ayrton,” said the engineer.\r\n\r\nThe two embarked in the boat. Ayrton lit the lantern, and, placing it\r\nin the bow of the boat, took the oars, and Smith, taking the tiller,\r\nsteered into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe Nautilus was no longer here to illuminate this sombre cavern.\r\nPerhaps the electric irradiation still shone under the waters, but no\r\nlight came from the abyss where Captain Nemo reposed.\r\n\r\nThe light of the lantern was barely sufficient to permit the engineer\r\nto advance, following the right hand wall of the crypt. A sepulchral\r\nsilence reigned in this portion of the vault, but soon Smith heard\r\ndistinctly the mutterings which came from the interior of the earth.\r\n\r\n“It is the volcano,” he said.\r\n\r\nSoon, with this noise, the chemical combinations betrayed themselves by\r\na strong odor, and sulphurous vapors choked the engineer and his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“It is as Captain Nemo feared,” murmured Smith, growing pale. “We must\r\ngo on to the end.”\r\n\r\nTwenty-five minutes after having left the opening the two reached the\r\nterminal wall and stopped.\r\n\r\nSmith standing on the seat, moved the lantern about over this wall,\r\nwhich separated the crypt from the central chimney of the volcano. How\r\nthick was it? Whether 100 feet or but 10 could not be determined. But\r\nthe subterranean noises were too plainly heard for it to be very thick.\r\n\r\nThe engineer, after having explored the wall along a horizontal line,\r\nfixed the lantern to the end of an oar and went over it again at a\r\ngreater height.\r\n\r\nThere, through scarcely visible cracks, came a pungent smoke, which\r\ninfected the air of the cavern. The wall was striped with these\r\nfractures, and some of the larger ones came to within a few feet of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAt first, Smith rested thoughtful. Then he murmured these words:—\r\n\r\n“Yes! Captain Nemo was right! There is the danger, and it is terrible!”\r\n\r\nAyrton said nothing, but, on a sign from the engineer, he took up the\r\noars, and, a half hour later, he and Smith came out of Crypt Dakkar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH’S RECITAL—HASTENING THE WORK—A LAST VISIT TO THE CORRAL—THE\r\nCOMBAT BETWEEN THE FIRE AND THE WATER—THE ASPECT OF THE ISLAND—THEY\r\nDECIDE TO LAUNCH THE SHIP—THE NIGHT OF THE 8TH OF MARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the 8th of January, after a day and night passed at\r\nthe corral, Smith and Ayrton returned to Granite House.\r\n\r\nThen the engineer assembled his companions, and told them that Lincoln\r\nIsland was in fearful danger—a danger which no human power could\r\nprevent.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said he,—and his voice betrayed great emotion,—“Lincoln\r\nIsland is doomed to destruction sooner or later; the cause is in itself\r\nand there is no means of removing it!”\r\n\r\nThe colonists looked at each other. They did not understand him.\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself, Cyrus,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“I will, or rather I will give you the explanation which Captain Nemo\r\ngave me, when I was alone with him.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Nemo!” cried the colonists.\r\n\r\n“Yes; it was the last service he rendered us before he died.”\r\n\r\n“The last service!” cried Pencroff. “The last service! You think,\r\nbecause he is dead, that he will help us no more!”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?” asked the reporter.\r\n\r\n“This, my friends,” answered the engineer. “Lincoln Island is not like\r\nthe other islands of the Pacific, and a particular event, made known to\r\nme by Captain Nemo, will cause, sooner or later, the destruction of its\r\nsubmarine framework.”\r\n\r\n“Destruction of Lincoln Island! What an idea!” cried Pencroff, who, in\r\nspite of his respect for Smith, could not help shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Pencroff,” continued the engineer. “This is what Captain\r\nNemo ascertained and what I verified yesterday In Crypt Dakkar. The\r\ncrypt extends under the island as far as the volcano, and is only\r\nseparated from the central chimney by the wall. Now this wall is seamed\r\nwith fractures and cracks, through which the sulphurous gas is already\r\nescaping.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Pencroff, wrinkling his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Well, I have ascertained that these fractures are widening under the\r\npressure from within, that the basalt wall la gradually bursting open,\r\nand that, sooner or later, it will give a passage to the waters of the\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right!” exclaimed Pencroff, trying still to make light of\r\nthe subject. “That’s all right! The sea will put out the volcano, and\r\nthat will be the end of it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that will be the end of it!” answered Smith. “On the day that the\r\nsea rushes through the wall and penetrates by the central chimney to\r\nthe bowels of the island, where the eruptive matter is boiling, on that\r\nday, Pencroff, Lincoln Island will go up, as Sicily would go up, if the\r\nMediterranean was emptied into Aetna!”\r\n\r\nThe colonists made no reply. They understood the threatened danger.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer doubtful that the island was menaced by a frightful\r\nexplosion. That it would last only as long as the wall to Crypt Dakkar\r\nremained intact. This was not a question of months, nor of weeks, bat\r\nof days, of hours, perhaps!\r\n\r\nThe first sensation the colonists experienced was one of profound\r\nsorrow. They did not think of the peril which menaced them directly,\r\nbut of the destruction of that land which had given them asylum, of\r\nthat island which they had cultivated, which they loved, which they\r\nwished to render so prosperous some day! All their labor uselessly\r\nemployed, all their work lost!\r\n\r\nPencroff did not attempt to hide the tears which rolled down his\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nThey talked for some little time longer. The chances which they might\r\ncount upon were discussed; but, in conclusion, they realized that not\r\nan hour was to be lost; that the ship must be completed as soon as\r\npossible, as, now, it was the only chance of safety left, to the\r\ninhabitants of Lincoln Island!\r\n\r\nAll hands were required. Where was the use, now, of sowing, or\r\nharvesting, of hunting or increasing the reserve at Granite House? The\r\npresent contents of the magazine were sufficient to provision the ship\r\nfor as long a voyage as she could make! What was necessary was that\r\nthese should be at\r\n\r\nthe disposal of the colonists before the accomplishment of the\r\ninevitable catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe work was undertaken with feverish eagerness. By the 23d of January\r\nthe ship was half planked. Up to this time there had been no change in\r\nthe volcano. It was always the vapors, the smoke mixed with flames and\r\npierced by incandescent stones, which escaped from the crater. But\r\nduring the night of the 23d the upper cone, which formed the cap of the\r\nvolcano, was lifted off by the pressure of the lava, which had reached\r\nthe level of the lower cone. A terrible noise was heard. The colonists,\r\nbelieving that the island was going to pieces, rushed out of Granite\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIt was 2 o’clock in the morning. The heavens were on fire. The upper\r\ncone—a mass a thousand feet high, and weighing thousands of millions of\r\npounds—had been thrown upon the island, making the earth tremble.\r\nHappily, this cone leaned to the north, and it fell upon the plain of\r\nsand and tufa which lay between the volcano and the sea. The crater, by\r\nthis means greatly widened, threw towards the sky a light so intense,\r\nthat, by the simple effect of reverberation, the atmosphere seemed to\r\nbe incandescent. At the same time a torrent of lava swelled up over\r\nthis new summit, falling in long streams, like water escaping from an\r\noverflowing vase, and a thousand fiery serpents writhed upon the talus\r\nof the volcano.\r\n\r\n“The corral! The corral!” cried Ayrton.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, towards the corral that the lava took their way,\r\nfollowing the slope of the new crater, and, consequently, the fertile\r\nparts of the island. The sources of Red Creek, and Jacamar Wood were\r\nthreatened with immediate destruction.\r\n\r\nAt the cry of Ayrton, the colonists had rushed towards the stable of\r\nthe onagers, and harnessed the animals. All had but one thought. To fly\r\nto the corral and let loose the beasts confined there.\r\n\r\nBefore 3 o’clock they were there. Frightful cries indicated the terror\r\nof the moufflons and goats. Already a torrent of incandescent matter,\r\nof liquified minerals, fell over the mountain spur upon the plain,\r\ndestroying that side of the palisade. The gate was hastily opened by\r\nAyrton, and the animals, wild with terror, escaped in every direction.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the boiling lava filled the corral, volatilizing the\r\nwater of the little brook which traversed it, firing the house, which\r\nburned like a bit of stubble, devouring to the last stake the\r\nsurrounding palisade. Nothing was left of the corral.\r\n\r\nThe colonists wanted to struggle against this invasion; they had tried\r\nit, but foolishly and uselessly: man is helpless before these grand\r\ncataclysms.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 24th arrived. Smith and his companions, before\r\nreturning to Granite House, wished to observe the definite direction\r\nwhich this inundation of lava would take. The general slope of the\r\nground from Mount Franklin was towards the east coast, and it was to be\r\nfeared that, notwithstanding the thick Jacamar Woods, the torrent would\r\nextend to Prospect Plateau.\r\n\r\n“The lake will protect us,” said Spilett.\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” answered Smith. But that was all he said.\r\n\r\nThe colonists would have liked to have advanced as far as the place on\r\nwhich the upper cone of Mount Franklin abutted, but their passage was\r\nbarred by the lavas, which followed, on the one hand, the valley of Red\r\nCreek, and, on the other, the course of Fall River, vaporizing these\r\ntwo streams in their passage. There was no possible way of crossing\r\nthis stream; it was necessary, on the contrary, to fly before it. The\r\nflattened volcano was no longer recognizable. A sort of smooth slab\r\nterminated it, replacing the old crater. Two outlets, broken in the\r\nsouth and east sides, poured forth unceasing streams of lava, which\r\nformed two distinct currents. Above the new crater, a cloud of smoke\r\nand cinders mixed with the vapors of the sky, and hung over the island.\r\nPeals of thunder mingled with the rumbling of the mountain. Burning\r\nrocks were thrown up thousands of feet, bursting in the sky and\r\nscattering like grape-shot. The heavens answered with lightning-flashes\r\nthe eruption of the volcano.\r\n\r\nBy 7 o’clock the colonists were no longer able to keep their position\r\non the edge of Jacamar Wood. Not only did the projectiles begin to fall\r\nabout them, but the lavas, overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened\r\nto cut off the road from the corral. The first ranks of trees took\r\nfire, and their sap, vaporized, made them explode like fire-crackers;\r\nwhile others, less humid, remained intact in the midst of the\r\ninundation.\r\n\r\nThe colonists started back. The torrent, owing to the slope of the\r\nland, gained eastward rapidly, and as the lower layers of lava\r\nhardened, others, boiling, covered them.\r\n\r\nMeantime the principal current in the Red Creek Valley became more and\r\nmore threatening. All that part of the forest was surrounded, and\r\nenormous clouds of smoke rolled above the trees, whose roots were\r\nalready in the lava.\r\n\r\nThe colonists stopped at the lake shore, half a mile from the mouth of\r\nRed Creek. A question of life or death was about to be decided for\r\nthem. Smith, accustomed to think and reason in the presence of danger,\r\nand aware that he was speaking to men who could face the truth,\r\nwhatever it might be, said to them:—\r\n\r\n“Either the lake will arrest this current, and a part of the island\r\nwill be preserved from complete devastation, or the current will invade\r\nthe forests of the Far West, and not a tree, not a plant will be left\r\nupon the face of the ground. We will have, upon these rocks stripped of\r\nlife, the prospect of a death which the explosion of the island may\r\nanticipate!\r\n\r\n“Then,” cried Pencroff, crossing his arms and stamping his foot on the\r\nground, “it is useless to work on the ship! Isn’t that so?”\r\n\r\n“Pencroff,” answered Smith, “it is necessary to do one’s duty to the\r\nend.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the flood of lava, after having eaten its way through\r\nthe splendid trees of the forest, neared the lake. There was a certain\r\ndepression in the ground, which, if it had been larger, might, perhaps,\r\nsuffice to hold the torrent.\r\n\r\n“Let us try!” cried Smith.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the engineer was instantly understood by all. It was\r\nnecessary to dam, so to speak, this torrent and force it into the lake.\r\n\r\nThe colonists ran to the shipyard and brought back from there shovels,\r\npicks, and hatchets, and by means of earthworks and hewn trees they\r\nsucceeded, in a few hours, in raising a barrier three feet high and\r\nsome hundreds of feet long. It seemed to them, when they had finished,\r\nthat they had not worked more than a few minutes!\r\n\r\nIt was time. The liquified matter already reached the extremity of the\r\nbarrier. The flood spread like a swollen river seeking to overflow its\r\nbanks and threatening to break down the only obstacle which could\r\nprevent its devastating all the Far West. But the barrier was\r\nsufficient to withstand it, and, after one terrible moment of\r\nhesitation, it precipitated itself into Lake Grant by a fall twenty\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, breathless, without a word, without a gesture, looked\r\nupon this struggle of the elements.\r\n\r\nWhat a sight was this, the combat between fire and water! What pen can\r\ndescribe this scene of marvellous horror; what pencil can portray it?\r\nThe water hissed and steamed at the contact of the boiling lavas. The\r\nsteam was thrown, whirling, to an immeasurable height in the air, as if\r\nthe valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened. But, great as\r\nwas the mass of water contained in the lake, it must, finally, be\r\nabsorbed, since it was not renewed, while the torrent, fed from an\r\ninexhaustible source, was ceaselessly pouring in fresh floods of\r\nincandescent matter.\r\n\r\nThe first lavas which fell into the lake solidified at once, and\r\naccumulated in such a manner as soon to emerge above the surface. Over\r\nthese slid other lavas, which in their turn became stone, forming a\r\nbreakwater, which threatened to fill up the lake, which could not\r\noverflow, as its surplus water was carried off in steam. Hissings and\r\nshrivellings filled the air with a stunning noise, and the steam,\r\ncarried off by the wind, fell to the ground in rain. The jetty spread,\r\nand where formerly had been peaceable waters appeared an enormous heap\r\nof smoking rocks, as if some upheaval of the ground had raised these\r\nthousands of reefs. If one can imagine these waters tossed about by a\r\nstorm, and then suddenly solidified by cold, he will have the\r\nappearance of the lake three hours after the irresistible torrent had\r\npoured into it.\r\n\r\nThis time the water had been overcome by the fire.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was a fortunate thing for the colonists that the lavas\r\nhad been turned into the lake. It gave them some days’ respite.\r\nProspect Plateau, Granite House, and the ship-yard were safe for the\r\nmoment. In these few days they must plank and caulk the vessel, launch\r\nit, and take refuge upon it, rigging it after it was on the sea. With\r\nthe fear of the explosion menacing the destruction of the island, it\r\nwas no longer safe to remain on land. Granite House, so safe a retreat\r\nup to this time, might, at any moment, fall!\r\n\r\nDuring the next six days, the colonists worked on the ship with all\r\ntheir might. Sleeping but little, the light of the flames from the\r\nvolcano permitted them to work by night as well as by day. The eruption\r\ncontinued without cessation, but, perhaps, less abundantly. A fortunate\r\ncircumstance, since Lake Grant was nearly full; and if fresh lavas had\r\nslid over the surface of the former layers, they would inevitably have\r\nspread over Prospect Plateau and from there to the shore.\r\n\r\nBut while this part of the island was partially protected it was\r\notherwise with the west coast.\r\n\r\nThe second current of lava, following the valley of Fall River, met\r\nwith no obstacle. The ground on either side of the bank was low, and\r\nthe incandescent liquid was spread through the forest of the Far West.\r\nAt this season of the year the trees were dried by the warmth of the\r\nsummer and took fire instantly, and the high interlacing branches\r\nhastened the progress of the conflagration. It seemed as if the current\r\nof flame traversed the surface of the forest more swiftly than the\r\ncurrent of lavas its depths.\r\n\r\nThe beasts and birds of the woods sought refuge on the shore of the\r\nMercy and in the marshes of Tadorn’s Fens. But the colonists were too\r\nbusy to pay any attention to these animals. They had, moreover,\r\nabandoned Granite House; they had not even sought refuge in the\r\nChimneys, but they camped in a tent near the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n\r\nEvery day Smith and Spilett climbed up to Prospect Plateau. Sometimes\r\nHerbert went with them, but Pencroff never. The sailor did not wish to\r\nlook upon the island in its present condition of devastation.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a desolate spectacle. All its wooded part was now\r\ndenuded. One single group of green trees remained on the extremity of\r\nSerpentine Peninsula. Here and there appeared some blackened stumps.\r\nThe site of the forests was more desolate than Tadorn’s Fens. The\r\ninvasion of the lavas had been complete. Where formerly had been a\r\npleasant verdure, was now nothing but a waste covered with volcanic\r\ntufa. The valleys of Fall River and Red Creek contained no water, and\r\nif Lake Grant had been completely filled up, the colonists would have\r\nhad no means to slack their thirst. But fortunately its southern\r\nextremity had been spared, and formed a sort of pool, which held all\r\nthe fresh water remaining on the island. To the northwest the spurs of\r\nthe mountain, in jagged outline, looked like a gigantic claw grasping\r\nthe ground. What a doleful spectacle! What a frightful aspect! How\r\ngrevious for the colonists, who, from a domain, fertile, wooded,\r\n\r\ntraversed by water-courses, enriched by harvests, found themselves, in\r\nan instant, reduced to a devastated rock, upon which, without their\r\nstores, they would not have had the means of living.\r\n\r\n“It is heart-breaking!” said the reporter.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Spilett,” answered the engineer. And pray heaven that we are\r\ngiven time to finish the ship, which is now our sole refuge!”\r\n\r\n“Does it not seem to you, Cyrus, that the volcano is subsiding? It\r\nstill vomits lava, but, I think, less freely!”\r\n\r\n“It matters little,” answered Smith. “The fire is still fierce in the\r\nbowels of the mountain, and the sea may rush in there at any moment. We\r\nare like persons on a ship devoured by a fire which they cannot\r\ncontrol, who know that sooner or later the flames will reach the powder\r\nmagazine. Come, Spilett, come, we have not an hour to lose!”\r\n\r\nFor eight days longer, that is to say until the 8th of February, the\r\nlavas continued to flow, but the eruption confined itself to the limits\r\ndescribed. Smith feared more than anything else an overflow of the\r\nlavas on to the beach, in which case the ship-yard would be destroyed.\r\nBut about this time the colonists felt vibrations in the ground which\r\ngave them the greatest uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe 20th of February arrived. A month longer was necessary to fit the\r\nship for sea. Would the island last that long? It was Smith’s intention\r\nto launch her as soon as her hull should be sufficiently caulked. The\r\ndeck, lining, arranging the interior, and the rigging could be done\r\nafterwards, but the important thing was to secure a refuge off the\r\nisland. Perhaps it would be better to take the vessel round to Balloon\r\nHarbor, the point farthest from the eruptive centre, as, at the mouth\r\nof the Mercy, between the islet and the granite wall, she ran the risk\r\nof being crushed, in case of a breaking up of the island. Therefore,\r\nall the efforts of the workmen were directed to completing the hull.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of March they were able to calculate that the ship could be\r\nlaunched in twelve days.\r\n\r\nHope returned to the hearts of these colonists, who had been so sorely\r\ntried during this fourth year of their sojourn on Lincoln Island! Even\r\nPencroff was roused from the taciturnity into which he had been plunged\r\nby the ruin and devastation of his domain. He thought of nothing else\r\nbut the ship, on which he concentrated all his hopes.\r\n\r\n“We will finish her!” he said to the engineer, “we will finish her, Mr.\r\nSmith, and it is high time, for you see how far advanced the season is,\r\nand it will soon be the equinox. Well, if it is necessary, we will\r\nwinter at Tabor Island! But Tabor Island after Lincoln Island! Alas!\r\nhow unlucky I am! To think that I should live to see such a thing as\r\nthis!”\r\n\r\n“Let us make haste!” was the invariable answer of the engineer.\r\n\r\nAnd every one worked unceasingly.\r\n\r\n“Master,” asked Neb, some days later, “if Captain Nemo had been alive,\r\ndo you think this would have happened?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Neb,” answered the engineer.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so!” whispered Pencroff to the negro.\r\n\r\n“Nor I!” replied Neb.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week in March Mount Franklin became again threatening.\r\nThousands of threads of glass, made by the fluid lavas, fell like rain\r\nto the ground. The crater gave forth fresh torrents of lava that flowed\r\ndown every side of the volcano. These torrents flowed over the surface\r\nof hardened lava, and destroyed the last vestiges of the trees which\r\nhad survived the first eruption. The current, this time following the\r\nsouthwest shore of Lake Grant, flowed along Glycerine Creek and invaded\r\nProspect Plateau. This last calamity was a terrible blow to the\r\ncolonists; of the mill, the poultry-yard, the stables, nothing\r\nremained. The frightened inhabitants of these places fled in every\r\ndirection. Top and Jup gave signs of the utmost terror, and their\r\ninstinct warned them of an impending disaster. A large number of\r\nanimals had perished in the first eruption, and those which survived\r\nhad found their only refuge in Tadorn’s Fens, and on Prospect Plateau.\r\nBut this last retreat was now closed from them, and the torrent of lava\r\nhaving reached the edge of the granite wall, began to fall over on to\r\nthe shore in cataracts of fire. The sublime horror of this spectacle\r\npasses all description. At night it looked like a Niagara of molten\r\nmatter, with its incandescent spray rising on high and its boiling\r\nmasses below!\r\n\r\nThe colonists were driven to their last refuge, and, although the upper\r\nseams were uncaulked, they resolved to launch their ship into the sea!\r\n\r\nPencroff and Ayrton made the preparations for this event, which was to\r\ntake place on the morning of the next day, the 9th of March.\r\n\r\nBut, during that night, an enormous column of steam escaped from the\r\ncrater, rising in the midst of terrific detonations to a height of more\r\nthan 3,000 feet. The wall of Crypt Dakkar had given way under the\r\npressure of the gas, and the sea, pouring\r\n\r\nthrough the central chimney into the burning gulf, was turned into\r\nsteam!\r\n\r\nThe crater was not a sufficient vent for this vapor!\r\n\r\nAn explosion, which could have been heard a hundred miles away, shook\r\nthe very heavens! Fragments of the mountain fell into the Pacific, and,\r\nin a few minutes, the ocean covered the place where Lincoln Island had\r\nbeen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ISOLATED ROCK IN THE PACIFIC—THE LAST REFUGE OF THE COLONISTS—THE\r\nPROSPECT OF DEATH—UNEXPECTED SUCCOR—HOW AND WHY IT CAME—THE LAST GOOD\r\nACTION—AN ISLAND ON TERRA FIRMA-THE TOMB OF CAPTAIN NEMO.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn isolated rock, thirty feet long, fifteen feet wide, rising ten feet\r\nabove the surface of the water, this was the sole solid point which had\r\nnot vanished beneath the waves of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIt was all that remained of Granite House! The wall had been thrown\r\nover, then broken to pieces, and some of the rocks of the great hall\r\nhad been so heaped together as to form this culminating point. All else\r\nhad disappeared in the surrounding abyss: the lower cone of Mount\r\nFranklin, torn to pieces by the explosion; the lava jaws of Shark Gulf;\r\nProspect Plateau, Safety Islet, the granite of Balloon Harbor; the\r\nbasalt of Crypt Dakkar; Serpentine Peninsula—had been precipitated into\r\nthe eruptive centre! All that remained of Lincoln Island was this rock,\r\nthe refuge of the six colonists and their dog Top.\r\n\r\nAll the animals had perished in the catastrophe. The birds as well as\r\nthe beasts, all were crashed or drowned, and poor Jup, alas! had been\r\nswallowed up in some crevasse in the ground!\r\n\r\nSmith, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroff, Neb, and Ayrton had survived,\r\nbecause, being gathered together in their tent, they had been thrown\r\ninto the sea, at the moment when the debris of the island rained down\r\nupon the water.\r\n\r\nWhen they came again to the surface they saw nothing but this rock,\r\nhalf a cable length away, to which they swam.\r\n\r\nThey had been here nine days! Some provisions, brought from the\r\nmagazine of Granite House before the catastrophe, a little soft water\r\nleft by the rain in the crevice of the rock—this was all that the\r\nunfortunates possessed. Their last hope, their ship, had been broken to\r\npieces. They had no means of leaving this reef. No fire, nor anything\r\nwith which to make it. They were doomed to perish!\r\n\r\nThis day, the 18th of March, there remained a supply of food, which,\r\nwith the strictest care, could last but forty-eight hours longer. All\r\ntheir knowledge, all their skill, could avail them nothing now. They\r\nwere entirely at God’s mercy.\r\n\r\nSmith was calm, Spilett somewhat nervous, and Pencroff, ready to throw\r\nhimself into the sea. Herbert never left the engineer; and gazed upon\r\nhim, as if demanding the succor which he could not give. Neb and Ayrton\r\nwere resigned after their manner.\r\n\r\n“Oh, misery! misery!” repeated Pencroff. “If we had but a walnut-shell\r\nto take us to Tabor Island! But nothing; not a thing!”\r\n\r\n“And Captain Nemo is dead!” said Neb.\r\n\r\nDuring the five days which followed, Smith and his companions ate just\r\nenough of the supply of food to keep them from famishing. Their\r\nfeebleness was extreme. Herbert and Neb began to show signs of\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\nIn this situation had they a shadow of hope? No! What was their sole\r\nchance? That a ship would pass in sight of the rock? They knew, by\r\nexperience, that ships never visited this part of the Pacific. Could\r\nthey count, then, by a coincidence which would be truly providential,\r\nupon the Scotch yacht coming just at this time to search for Ayrton at\r\nTabor Island? It was not probable. And, moreover, supposing that it\r\ncame, since the colonists had placed no notice there indicating the\r\nplace where Ayrton was to be found, the captain of the yacht, after a\r\nfruitless search of the island, would proceed at once to regain the\r\nlower latitudes.\r\n\r\nNo! they could entertain no hope of being saved, and a horrible death,\r\na death by hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this rock!\r\n\r\nAlready they lay stretched out, inanimate, unconscious of what was\r\ngoing on around them. Only, Ayrton, by a supreme effort, raised his\r\nhead, and cast a despairing look over this desert sea!\r\n\r\nBut, behold! on this morning of the 24th of March, Ayrton extended his\r\narms towards some point in space; he rose up, first to his knees, then\r\nstood upright; he waved his hand—\r\n\r\nA ship was in sight of the island! This ship did not sail these seas at\r\nhap-hazard. The reef was the point towards which she directed her\r\ncourse, crowding on all steam, and the unfortunates would have seen her\r\nmany hours before, had they had the strength to scan the horizon!\r\n\r\n“The Duncan!” murmured Ayrton, and then he fell senseless upon the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Smith and his companions regained consciousness, thanks to the\r\ncare lavished upon them, they found themselves in the cabin of a\r\nsteamer, unaware of the manner in which they had escaped death.\r\n\r\nA word from Ayrton was sufficient to enlighten them.\r\n\r\n“It is the Duncan,” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“The Duncan!” answered Smith. And then, raising his arms to heaven, he\r\nexclaimed:—\r\n\r\n“Oh, all powerful Providence! thou hast wished that we should be\r\nsaved!”\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, the Duncan, Lord Glenarvan’s yacht, at this time\r\ncommanded by Robert, the son of Captain Grant, who had been sent to\r\nTabor Island to search for Ayrton and bring him home after twelve years\r\nof expatriation!\r\n\r\nThe colonists were saved, they were already on the homeward route!\r\n\r\n“Captain Robert,” asked Smith, “what suggested to you the idea, after\r\nleaving Tabor Island, where you were unable to find Ayrton, to come in\r\nthis direction?”\r\n\r\n“It was to search, not only for Ayrton, Mr. Smith, but for you and your\r\ncompanions!”\r\n\r\n“My companions and myself?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless! On Lincoln Island!”\r\n\r\n“Lincoln Island!” cried the others, greatly astonished.\r\n\r\n“How did you know of Lincoln Island?” asked Smith. “It is not on the\r\nmaps.”\r\n\r\n“I knew of it by the notice which you left on Tabor Island,” answered\r\nGrant.\r\n\r\n“The notice?” cried Spilett.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, and here it is,” replied the other, handing him a paper\r\nindicating the exact position of the Lincoln Island, “the actual\r\nresidence of Ayrton and of five American colonists.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Nemo!” said Smith, after having read the notice, and\r\nrecognized that it was in the same handwriting as the paper found at\r\nthe corral.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Pencroff, “it was he who took our Good Luck, he who ventured\r\nalone to Tabor Island!”\r\n\r\n“To place this notice there!” answered Herbert.\r\n\r\n“Then I was right when I said,” cried the sailor, “that he would do us\r\na last service even after his death!”\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said Smith, in a voice moved by emotion, “may the God of\r\nsinners receive the soul of Captain Nemo; he was our savior!”\r\n\r\nThe colonists, uncovering as Smith spake thus, murmured the name of the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nThen Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said to him, simply:—\r\n\r\n“What shall be done with the coffer?”\r\n\r\nAyrton had saved this coffer at the risk of his life, at the moment\r\nwhen the island was engulfed. He now faithfully returned it to the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n“Ayrton! Ayrton!” exclaimed Smith, greatly affected.\r\n\r\nThen addressing Grant:—\r\n\r\n“Captain,” he said, “where you left a criminal, you have found a man\r\nwhom expiation has made honest, and to whom I am proud to give my\r\nhand!”\r\n\r\nThereupon Grant was informed of all the strange history of Captain Nemo\r\nand the colonists of Lincoln Island. And then, the bearings of this\r\nremaining reef having been taken, Captain Grant gave the order to go\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nFifteen days later the colonists landed in America, which they found at\r\npeace after the terrible war which had ended in the triumph of justice\r\nand right. Of the wealth contained in the coffer, the greater part was\r\nemployed in the purchase of a vast tract of land in Iowa. One single\r\npearl, the most beautiful of all, was taken from the treasure and sent\r\nto Lady Glenarvan in the name of the castaways, who had been rescued by\r\nthe Duncan.\r\n\r\nTo this domain the colonists invited to labor—that is, to fortune and\r\nto happiness—all those whom they had counted on receiving at Lincoln\r\nIsland. Here they founded a great colony, to which they gave the name\r\nof the island which had disappeared in the depths of the Pacific. They\r\nfound here a river which they called the Mercy, a mountain to which\r\nthey gave the name of Franklin, a little lake which they called Lake\r\nGrant, and forests which became the forests of the Far West. It was\r\nlike an island on terra-firma.\r\n\r\nHere, under the skillful hand of the engineer and his companions,\r\neverything prospered. Not one of the former colonists was missing, for\r\nthey had agreed always to live together, Neb wherever his master was,\r\nAyrton always ready to sacrifice himself, Pencroff a better farmer than\r\nhe had been a sailor, Herbert who finished his studies under Smith’s\r\ndirection, Spilett who founded the New Lincoln _Herald_, which was the\r\nbest edited journal in the whole world.\r\n\r\nHere Smith and his companions often received visits from Lord and Lady\r\nGlenarvan, from Captain John Mangles and his wife, sister to Robert\r\nGrant, from Robert Grant himself, from Major MacNabbs, from all those\r\nwho had been mixed up in the double history of Captain Grant and\r\nCaptain Nemo.\r\n\r\nHere, finally, all were happy, united in the present as they had been\r\nin the past; but never did they forget that island upon which they had\r\narrived poor and naked, that island which, for four years, had sufficed\r\nfor all their needs, and of which all that remained was a morsel of\r\ngranite, beaten by the waves of the Pacific, the tomb of him who was\r\nCaptain Nemo!\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY.\r\n\r\nAGOUTI.
