Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities,\" was inscribed. The\r\ncontents of its window were curiously variegated. They comprised some\r\nelephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a\r\nbox of eyes, two skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten\r\nstuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a\r\nflyblown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily\r\ndirty, empty glass fish-tank. There was also, at the moment the story\r\nbegins, a mass of crystal, worked into the shape of an egg and\r\nbrilliantly polished. And at that two people, who stood outside the\r\nwindow, were looking, one of them a tall, thin clergyman, the other a\r\nblack-bearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume. The\r\ndusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation, and seemed anxious for\r\nhis companion to purchase the article.\r\n\r\nWhile they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard still\r\nwagging with the bread and butter of his tea. When he saw these men and\r\nthe object of their regard, his countenance fell. He glanced guiltily\r\nover his shoulder, and softly shut the door. He was a little old man,\r\nwith pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a dirty grey,\r\nand he wore a shabby blue frock coat, an ancient silk hat, and carpet\r\nslippers very much down at heel. He remained watching the two men as\r\nthey talked. The clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket, examined a\r\nhandful of money, and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile. Mr. Cave\r\nseemed still more depressed when they came into the shop.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the crystal egg.\r\nMr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour,\r\nand said five pounds. The clergyman protested that the price was high,\r\nto his companion as well as to Mr. Cave--it was, indeed, very much more\r\nthan Mr. Cave had intended to ask, when he had stocked the article--and\r\nan attempt at bargaining ensued. Mr. Cave stepped to the shop-door, and\r\nheld it open. \"Five pounds is my price,\" he said, as though he wished\r\nto save himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion. As he did so,\r\nthe upper portion of a woman's face appeared above the blind in the\r\nglass upper panel of the door leading into the parlour, and stared\r\ncuriously at the two customers. \"Five pounds is my price,\" said Mr.\r\nCave, with a quiver in his voice.\r\n\r\nThe swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching Cave\r\nkeenly. Now he spoke. \"Give him five pounds,\" he said. The clergyman\r\nglanced at him to see if he were in earnest, and, when he looked at Mr.\r\nCave again, he saw that the latter's face was white. \"It's a lot of\r\nmoney,\" said the clergyman, and, diving into his pocket, began counting\r\nhis resources. He had little more than thirty shillings, and he appealed\r\nto his companion, with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable\r\nintimacy. This gave Mr. Cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts,\r\nand he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not,\r\nas a matter of fact, entirely free for sale. His two customers were\r\nnaturally surprised at this, and inquired why he had not thought of that\r\nbefore he began to bargain. Mr. Cave became confused, but he stuck to\r\nhis story, that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon, that\r\na probable purchaser of it had already appeared. The two, treating this\r\nas an attempt to raise the price still further, made as if they would\r\nleave the shop. But at this point the parlour door opened, and the owner\r\nof the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared.\r\n\r\nShe was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very much larger\r\nthan Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was flushed. \"That\r\ncrystal _is_ for sale,\" she said. \"And five pounds is a good enough\r\nprice for it. I can't think what you're about, Cave, not to take the\r\ngentleman's offer!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at her over\r\nthe rims of his spectacles, and, without excessive assurance, asserted\r\nhis right to manage his business in his own way. An altercation began.\r\nThe two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement,\r\noccasionally assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions. Mr. Cave, hard\r\ndriven, persisted in a confused and impossible story of an enquiry for\r\nthe crystal that morning, and his agitation became painful. But he stuck\r\nto his point with extraordinary persistence. It was the young Oriental\r\nwho ended this curious controversy. He proposed that they should call\r\nagain in the course of two days--so as to give the alleged enquirer a\r\nfair chance. \"And then we must insist,\" said the clergyman, \"Five\r\npounds.\" Mrs. Cave took it on herself to apologise for her husband,\r\nexplaining that he was sometimes \"a little odd,\" and as the two\r\ncustomers left, the couple prepared for a free discussion of the\r\nincident in all its bearings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness. The poor\r\nlittle man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between his stories,\r\nmaintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view, and on\r\nthe other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas.\r\n\"Why did you ask five pounds?\" said his wife. \"_Do_ let me manage my\r\nbusiness my own way!\" said Mr. Cave.\r\n\r\nMr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and at\r\nsupper that night the transaction was re-discussed. None of them had a\r\nhigh opinion of Mr. Cave's business methods, and this action seemed a\r\nculminating folly.\r\n\r\n\"It's my opinion he's refused that crystal before,\" said the step-son, a\r\nloose-limbed lout of eighteen.\r\n\r\n\"But _Five Pounds_!\" said the step-daughter, an argumentative young\r\nwoman of six-and-twenty.\r\n\r\nMr. Cave's answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak assertions\r\nthat he knew his own business best. They drove him from his half-eaten\r\nsupper into the shop, to close it for the night, his ears aflame and\r\ntears of vexation behind his spectacles. \"Why had he left the crystal in\r\nthe window so long? The folly of it!\" That was the trouble closest in\r\nhis mind. For a time he could see no way of evading sale.\r\n\r\nAfter supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves up and\r\nwent out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business\r\naspects of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in\r\nhot water. Mr. Cave went into the shop, and stayed there until late,\r\nostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for goldfish cases but really\r\nfor a private purpose that will be better explained later. The next day\r\nMrs. Cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window, and\r\nwas lying behind some second-hand books on angling. She replaced it in a\r\nconspicuous position. But she did not argue further about it, as a\r\nnervous headache disinclined her from debate. Mr. Cave was always\r\ndisinclined. The day passed disagreeably. Mr. Cave was, if anything,\r\nmore absent-minded than usual, and uncommonly irritable withal. In the\r\nafternoon, when his wife was taking her customary sleep, he removed the\r\ncrystal from the window again.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish at one of\r\nthe hospital schools, where they were needed for dissection. In his\r\nabsence Mrs. Cave's mind reverted to the topic of the crystal, and the\r\nmethods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds. She had\r\nalready devised some very agreeable expedients, among others a dress of\r\ngreen silk for herself and a trip to Richmond, when a jangling of the\r\nfront door bell summoned her into the shop. The customer was an\r\nexamination coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain\r\nfrogs asked for the previous day. Mrs. Cave did not approve of this\r\nparticular branch of Mr. Cave's business, and the gentleman, who had\r\ncalled in a somewhat aggressive mood, retired after a brief exchange of\r\nwords--entirely civil so far as he was concerned. Mrs. Cave's eye then\r\nnaturally turned to the window; for the sight of the crystal was an\r\nassurance of the five pounds and of her dreams. What was her surprise to\r\nfind it gone!\r\n\r\nShe went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where she had\r\ndiscovered it the day before. It was not there; and she immediately\r\nbegan an eager search about the shop.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dog-fish, about a\r\nquarter to two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some confusion,\r\nand his wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter,\r\nrouting among his taxidermic material. Her face came up hot and angry\r\nover the counter, as the jangling bell announced his return, and she\r\nforthwith accused him of \"hiding it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hid _what_?\" asked Mr. Cave.\r\n\r\n\"The crystal!\"\r\n\r\nAt that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised, rushed to the window.\r\n\"Isn't it here?\" he said. \"Great Heavens! what has become of it?\"\r\n\r\nJust then, Mr. Cave's step-son re-entered the shop from the inner\r\nroom--he had come home a minute or so before Mr. Cave--and he was\r\nblaspheming freely. He was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture dealer\r\ndown the road, but he had his meals at home, and he was naturally\r\nannoyed to find no dinner ready.\r\n\r\nBut, when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his meal, and\r\nhis anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father. Their first\r\nidea, of course, was that he had hidden it. But Mr. Cave stoutly denied\r\nall knowledge of its fate--freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in\r\nthe matter--and at last was worked up to the point of accusing, first,\r\nhis wife and then his step-son of having taken it with a view to a\r\nprivate sale. So began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional\r\ndiscussion, which ended for Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous condition\r\nmidway between hysterics and amuck, and caused the step-son to be\r\nhalf-an-hour late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon. Mr.\r\nCave took refuge from his wife's emotions in the shop.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in a\r\njudicial spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter. The supper\r\npassed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene. Mr. Cave gave way at\r\nlast to extreme exasperation, and went out banging the front door\r\nviolently. The rest of the family, having discussed him with the freedom\r\nhis absence warranted, hunted the house from garret to cellar, hoping to\r\nlight upon the crystal.\r\n\r\nThe next day the two customers called again. They were received by Mrs.\r\nCave almost in tears. It transpired that no one _could_ imagine all\r\nthat she had stood from Cave at various times in her married\r\npilgrimage.... She also gave a garbled account of the disappearance. The\r\nclergyman and the Oriental laughed silently at one another, and said it\r\nwas very extraordinary. As Mrs. Cave seemed disposed to give them the\r\ncomplete history of her life they made to leave the shop. Thereupon Mrs.\r\nCave, still clinging to hope, asked for the clergyman's address, so\r\nthat, if she could get anything out of Cave, she might communicate it.\r\nThe address was duly given, but apparently was afterwards mislaid. Mrs.\r\nCave can remember nothing about it.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of that day, the Caves seem to have exhausted their\r\nemotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon, supped in a\r\ngloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned\r\ncontroversy of the previous days. For some time matters were very badly\r\nstrained in the Cave household, but neither crystal nor customer\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\nNow, without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was a liar.\r\nHe knew perfectly well where the crystal was. It was in the rooms of Mr.\r\nJacoby Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine's Hospital,\r\nWestbourne Street. It stood on the sideboard partially covered by a\r\nblack velvet cloth, and beside a decanter of American whisky. It is from\r\nMr. Wace, indeed, that the particulars upon which this narrative is\r\nbased were derived. Cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden\r\nin the dog-fish sack, and there had pressed the young investigator to\r\nkeep it for him. Mr. Wace was a little dubious at first. His\r\nrelationship to Cave was peculiar. He had a taste for singular\r\ncharacters, and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke and\r\ndrink in his rooms, and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in\r\ngeneral and of his wife in particular. Mr. Wace had encountered Mrs.\r\nCave, too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was not at home to attend to him.\r\nHe knew the constant interference to which Cave was subjected, and\r\nhaving weighed the story judicially, he decided to give the crystal a\r\nrefuge. Mr. Cave promised to explain the reasons for his remarkable\r\naffection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion, but he spoke\r\ndistinctly of seeing visions therein. He called on Mr. Wace the same\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nHe told a complicated story. The crystal he said had come into his\r\npossession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity\r\ndealer's effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he had\r\nticketed it at ten shillings. It had hung upon his hands at that price\r\nfor some months, and he was thinking of \"reducing the figure,\" when he\r\nmade a singular discovery.\r\n\r\nAt that time his health was very bad--and it must be borne in mind that,\r\nthroughout all this experience, his physical condition was one of\r\nebb--and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence,\r\nthe positive ill-treatment even, he received from his wife and\r\nstep-children. His wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling, and had a\r\ngrowing taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was mean and\r\nover-reaching; and his step-son had conceived a violent dislike for him,\r\nand lost no chance of showing it. The requirements of his business\r\npressed heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not think that he was\r\naltogether free from occasional intemperance. He had begun life in a\r\ncomfortable position, he was a man of fair education, and he suffered,\r\nfor weeks at a stretch, from melancholia and insomnia. Afraid to disturb\r\nhis family, he would slip quietly from his wife's side, when his\r\nthoughts became intolerable, and wander about the house. And about\r\nthree o'clock one morning, late in August, chance directed him into the\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nThe dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot, where\r\nhe perceived an unusual glow of light. Approaching this, he discovered\r\nit to be the crystal egg, which was standing on the corner of the\r\ncounter towards the window. A thin ray smote through a crack in the\r\nshutters, impinged upon the object, and seemed as it were to fill its\r\nentire interior.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of\r\noptics as he had known them in his younger days. He could understand the\r\nrays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its\r\ninterior, but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions. He\r\napproached the crystal nearly, peering into it and round it, with a\r\ntransient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth had\r\ndetermined his choice of a calling. He was surprised to find the light\r\nnot steady, but writhing within the substance of the egg, as though that\r\nobject was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour. In moving about to\r\nget different points of view, he suddenly found that he had come between\r\nit and the ray, and that the crystal none the less remained luminous.\r\nGreatly astonished, he lifted it out of the light ray and carried it to\r\nthe darkest part of the shop. It remained bright for some four or five\r\nminutes, when it slowly faded and went out. He placed it in the thin\r\nstreak of daylight, and its luminousness was almost immediately\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nSo far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable story of\r\nMr. Cave. He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light\r\n(which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre). And in a\r\nperfect darkness, such as could be produced by velvet wrapping, the\r\ncrystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent. It would\r\nseem, however, that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort, and\r\nnot equally visible to all eyes; for Mr. Harbinger--whose name will be\r\nfamiliar to the scientific reader in connection with the Pasteur\r\nInstitute--was quite unable to see any light whatever. And Mr. Wace's\r\nown capacity for its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that\r\nof Mr. Cave's. Even with Mr. Cave the power varied very considerably:\r\nhis vision was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue.\r\n\r\nNow, from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious\r\nfascination upon Mr. Cave. And it says more for his loneliness of soul\r\nthan a volume of pathetic writing could do, that he told no human being\r\nof his curious observations. He seems to have been living in such an\r\natmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure\r\nwould have been to risk the loss of it. He found that as the dawn\r\nadvanced, and the amount of diffused light increased, the crystal became\r\nto all appearance non-luminous. And for some time he was unable to see\r\nanything in it, except at night-time, in dark corners of the shop.\r\n\r\nBut the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a background for a\r\ncollection of minerals, occurred to him, and by doubling this, and\r\nputting it over his head and hands, he was able to get a sight of the\r\nluminous movement within the crystal even in the daytime. He was very\r\ncautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife, and he practised\r\nthis occupation only in the afternoons, while she was asleep upstairs,\r\nand then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter. And one day,\r\nturning the crystal about in his hands, he saw something. It came and\r\nwent like a flash, but it gave him the impression that the object had\r\nfor a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange\r\ncountry; and, turning it about, he did, just as the light faded, see\r\nthe same vision again.\r\n\r\nNow, it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of Mr.\r\nCave's discovery from this point. Suffice that the effect was this: the\r\ncrystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the\r\ndirection of the illuminating ray, gave a clear and consistent picture\r\nof a wide and peculiar countryside. It was not dream-like at all: it\r\nproduced a definite impression of reality, and the better the light the\r\nmore real and solid it seemed. It was a moving picture: that is to say,\r\ncertain objects moved in it, but slowly in an orderly manner like real\r\nthings, and, according as the direction of the lighting and vision\r\nchanged, the picture changed also. It must, indeed, have been like\r\nlooking through an oval glass at a view, and turning the glass about to\r\nget at different aspects.\r\n\r\nMr. Cave's statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely\r\ncircumstantial, and entirely free from any of that emotional quality\r\nthat taints hallucinatory impressions. But it must be remembered that\r\nall the efforts of Mr. Wace to see any similar clarity in the faint\r\nopalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful, try as he would.\r\nThe difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men\r\nwas very great, and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to Mr.\r\nCave was a mere blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace.\r\n\r\nThe view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an extensive\r\nplain, and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable\r\nheight, as if from a tower or a mast. To the east and to the west the\r\nplain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs, which\r\nreminded him of those he had seen in some picture; but what the picture\r\nwas Mr. Wace was unable to ascertain. These cliffs passed north and\r\nsouth--he could tell the points of the compass by the stars that were\r\nvisible of a night--receding in an almost illimitable perspective and\r\nfading into the mists of the distance before they met. He was nearer the\r\neastern set of cliffs, on the occasion of his first vision the sun was\r\nrising over them, and black against the sunlight and pale against their\r\nshadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that Mr. Cave regarded as\r\nbirds. A vast range of buildings spread below him; he seemed to be\r\nlooking down upon them; and, as they approached the blurred and\r\nrefracted edge of the picture, they became indistinct. There were also\r\ntrees curious in shape, and in colouring, a deep mossy green and an\r\nexquisite grey, beside a wide and shining canal. And something great and\r\nbrilliantly coloured flew across the picture. But the first time Mr.\r\nCave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes, his hands shook, his\r\nhead moved, the vision came and went, and grew foggy and indistinct. And\r\nat first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture again\r\nonce the direction of it was lost.\r\n\r\nHis next clear vision, which came about a week after the first, the\r\ninterval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful\r\nexperience, showed him the view down the length of the valley. The view\r\nwas different, but he had a curious persuasion, which his subsequent\r\nobservations abundantly confirmed, that he was regarding this strange\r\nworld from exactly the same spot, although he was looking in a different\r\ndirection. The long façade of the great building, whose roof he had\r\nlooked down upon before, was now receding in perspective. He recognised\r\nthe roof. In the front of the façade was a terrace of massive\r\nproportions and extraordinary length, and down the middle of the\r\nterrace, at certain intervals, stood huge but very graceful masts,\r\nbearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun. The import\r\nof these small objects did not occur to Mr. Cave until some time after,\r\nas he was describing the scene to Mr. Wace. The terrace overhung a\r\nthicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation, and beyond this\r\nwas a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad creatures, in form like\r\nbeetles but enormously larger, reposed. Beyond this again was a richly\r\ndecorated causeway of pinkish stone; and beyond that, and lined with\r\ndense _red_ weeds, and passing up the valley exactly parallel with the\r\ndistant cliffs, was a broad and mirror-like expanse of water. The air\r\nseemed full of squadrons of great birds, manœuvring in stately curves;\r\nand across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings, richly\r\ncoloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets, among a forest\r\nof moss-like and lichenous trees. And suddenly something flapped\r\nrepeatedly across the vision, like the fluttering of a jewelled fan or\r\nthe beating of a wing, and a face, or rather the upper part of a face\r\nwith very large eyes, came as it were close to his own and as if on the\r\nother side of the crystal. Mr. Cave was so startled and so impressed by\r\nthe absolute reality of these eyes, that he drew his head back from the\r\ncrystal to look behind it. He had become so absorbed in watching that he\r\nwas quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little\r\nshop, with its familiar odour of methyl, mustiness, and decay. And, as\r\nhe blinked about him, the glowing crystal faded, and went out.\r\n\r\nSuch were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave. The story is\r\ncuriously direct and circumstantial. From the outset, when the valley\r\nfirst flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was strangely\r\naffected, and, as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he\r\nsaw, his wonder rose to the point of a passion. He went about his\r\nbusiness listless and distraught, thinking only of the time when he\r\nshould be able to return to his watching. And then a few weeks after his\r\nfirst sight of the valley came the two customers, the stress and\r\nexcitement of their offer, and the narrow escape of the crystal from\r\nsale, as I have already told.\r\n\r\nNow, while the thing was Mr. Cave's secret, it remained a mere wonder, a\r\nthing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might peep upon a\r\nforbidden garden. But Mr. Wace has, for a young scientific investigator,\r\na particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind. Directly the crystal\r\nand its story came to him, and he had satisfied himself, by seeing the\r\nphosphorescence with his own eyes, that there really was a certain\r\nevidence for Mr. Cave's statements, he proceeded to develop the matter\r\nsystematically. Mr. Cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes\r\non this wonderland he saw, and he came every night from half-past eight\r\nuntil half-past ten, and sometimes, in Mr. Wace's absence, during the\r\nday. On Sunday afternoons, also, he came. From the outset Mr. Wace made\r\ncopious notes, and it was due to his scientific method that the relation\r\nbetween the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal\r\nand the orientation of the picture were proved. And, by covering the\r\ncrystal in a box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the\r\nexciting ray, and by substituting black holland for his buff blinds, he\r\ngreatly improved the conditions of the observations; so that in a little\r\nwhile they were able to survey the valley in any direction they desired.\r\n\r\nSo having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this visionary\r\nworld within the crystal. The things were in all cases seen by Mr. Cave,\r\nand the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal\r\nand report what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as a science student had\r\nlearnt the trick of writing in the dark) wrote a brief note of his\r\nreport. When the crystal faded, it was put into its box in the proper\r\nposition and the electric light turned on. Mr. Wace asked questions, and\r\nsuggested observations to clear up difficult points. Nothing, indeed,\r\ncould have been less visionary and more matter-of-fact.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like\r\ncreatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier\r\nvisions. His first impression was soon corrected, and he considered for\r\na time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat. Then he\r\nthought, grotesquely enough, that they might be cherubs. Their heads\r\nwere round, and curiously human, and it was the eyes of one of them that\r\nhad so startled him on his second observation. They had broad, silvery\r\nwings, not feathered, but glistening almost as brilliantly as new-killed\r\nfish and with the same subtle play of colour, and these wings were not\r\nbuilt on the plan of bird-wing or bat, Mr. Wace learned, but supported\r\nby curved ribs radiating from the body. (A sort of butterfly wing with\r\ncurved ribs seems best to express their appearance.) The body was small,\r\nbut fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs, like long tentacles,\r\nimmediately under the mouth. Incredible as it appeared to Mr. Wace, the\r\npersuasion at last became irresistible, that it was these creatures\r\nwhich owned the great quasi-human buildings and the magnificent garden\r\nthat made the broad valley so splendid. And Mr. Cave perceived that the\r\nbuildings, with other peculiarities, had no doors, but that the great\r\ncircular windows, which opened freely, gave the creatures egress and\r\nentrance. They would alight upon their tentacles, fold their wings to a\r\nsmallness almost rod-like, and hop into the interior. But among them was\r\na multitude of smaller-winged creatures, like great dragon-flies and\r\nmoths and flying beetles, and across the greensward brilliantly-coloured\r\ngigantic ground-beetles crawled lazily to and fro. Moreover, on the\r\ncauseways and terraces, large-headed creatures similar to the greater\r\nwinged flies, but wingless, were visible, hopping busily upon their\r\nhand-like tangle of tentacles.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that\r\nstood upon the terrace of the nearer building. It dawned upon Mr. Cave,\r\nafter regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly\r\nvivid day, that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like\r\nthat into which he peered. And a still more careful scrutiny convinced\r\nhim that each one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one,\r\nand, folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the\r\nmast, would regard the crystal fixedly for a space,--sometimes for as\r\nlong as fifteen minutes. And a series of observations, made at the\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Wace, convinced both watchers that, so far as this\r\nvisionary world was concerned, the crystal into which they peered\r\nactually stood at the summit of the endmost mast on the terrace, and\r\nthat on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other\r\nworld had looked into Mr. Cave's face while he was making these\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nSo much for the essential facts of this very singular story. Unless we\r\ndismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace, we have to\r\nbelieve one of two things: either that Mr. Cave's crystal was in two\r\nworlds at once, and that, while it was carried about in one, it remained\r\nstationary in the other, which seems altogether absurd; or else that it\r\nhad some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar\r\ncrystal in this other world, so that what was seen in the interior of\r\nthe one in this world was, under suitable conditions, visible to an\r\nobserver in the corresponding crystal in the other world; and _vice\r\nversa_. At present, indeed, we do not know of any way in which two\r\ncrystals could so come _en rapport_, but nowadays we know enough to\r\nunderstand that the thing is not altogether impossible. This view of the\r\ncrystals as _en rapport_ was the supposition that occurred to Mr. Wace,\r\nand to me at least it seems extremely plausible....\r\n\r\nAnd where was this other world? On this, also, the alert intelligence of\r\nMr. Wace speedily threw light. After sunset, the sky darkened\r\nrapidly--there was a very brief twilight interval indeed--and the stars\r\nshone out. They were recognisably the same as those we see, arranged in\r\nthe same constellations. Mr. Cave recognised the Bear, the Pleiades,\r\nAldebaran, and Sirius: so that the other world must be somewhere in the\r\nsolar system, and, at the utmost, only a few hundreds of millions of\r\nmiles from our own. Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that the\r\nmidnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky, and that the\r\nsun seemed a little smaller. _And there were two small moons!_ \"like our\r\nmoon but smaller, and quite differently marked\" one of which moved so\r\nrapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it. These\r\nmoons were never high in the sky, but vanished as they rose: that is,\r\nevery time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near\r\ntheir primary planet. And all this answers quite completely, although\r\nMr. Cave did not know it, to what must be the condition of things on\r\nMars.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into\r\nthis crystal Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars and its\r\ninhabitants. And, if that be the case, then the evening star that shone\r\nso brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision, was neither more nor\r\nless than our own familiar earth.\r\n\r\nFor a time the Martians--if they were Martians--do not seem to have\r\nknown of Mr. Cave's inspection. Once or twice one would come to peer,\r\nand go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the vision was\r\nunsatisfactory. During this time Mr. Cave was able to watch the\r\nproceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their\r\nattentions, and, although his report is necessarily vague and\r\nfragmentary, it is nevertheless very suggestive. Imagine the impression\r\nof humanity a Martian observer would get who, after a difficult process\r\nof preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes, was able to\r\npeer at London from the steeple of St. Martin's Church for stretches, at\r\nlongest, of four minutes at a time. Mr. Cave was unable to ascertain if\r\nthe winged Martians were the same as the Martians who hopped about the\r\ncauseways and terraces, and if the latter could put on wings at will. He\r\nseveral times saw certain clumsy bipeds, dimly suggestive of apes, white\r\nand partially translucent, feeding among certain of the lichenous trees,\r\nand once some of these fled before one of the hopping, round-headed\r\nMartians. The latter caught one in its tentacles, and then the picture\r\nfaded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most tantalisingly in the dark. On\r\nanother occasion a vast thing, that Mr. Cave thought at first was some\r\ngigantic insect, appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity. As this drew nearer Mr. Cave perceived that\r\nit was a mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity.\r\nAnd then, when he looked again, it had passed out of sight.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the Martians,\r\nand the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to\r\nthe crystal Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away, and they immediately\r\nturned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of\r\nsignalling. But when at last Mr. Cave examined the crystal again the\r\nMartian had departed.\r\n\r\nThus far these observations had progressed in early November, and then\r\nMr. Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal\r\nwere allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in order that, as\r\noccasion arose in the daytime or night, he might comfort himself with\r\nwhat was fast becoming the most real thing in his existence.\r\n\r\nIn December Mr. Wace's work in connection with a forthcoming examination\r\nbecame heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week, and\r\nfor ten or eleven days--he is not quite sure which--he saw nothing of\r\nCave. He then grew anxious to resume these investigations, and, the\r\nstress of his seasonal labours being abated, he went down to Seven\r\nDials. At the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fancier's\r\nwindow, and then another at a cobbler's. Mr. Cave's shop was closed.\r\n\r\nHe rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black. He at once\r\ncalled Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe, in cheap but\r\nample widow's weeds of the most imposing pattern. Without any very\r\ngreat surprise Mr. Wace learnt that Cave was dead and already buried.\r\nShe was in tears, and her voice was a little thick. She had just\r\nreturned from Highgate. Her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects\r\nand the honourable details of the obsequies, but Mr. Wace was at last\r\nable to learn the particulars of Cave's death. He had been found dead in\r\nhis shop in the early morning, the day after his last visit to Mr. Wace,\r\nand the crystal had been clasped in his stone-cold hands. His face was\r\nsmiling, said Mrs. Cave, and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on\r\nthe floor at his feet. He must have been dead five or six hours when he\r\nwas found.\r\n\r\nThis came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach himself\r\nbitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man's\r\nill-health. But his chief thought was of the crystal. He approached that\r\ntopic in a gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs. Cave's peculiarities.\r\nHe was dumbfounded to learn that it was sold.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cave's first impulse, directly Cave's body had been taken upstairs,\r\nhad been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for\r\nthe crystal, informing him of its recovery; but after a violent hunt in\r\nwhich her daughter joined her, they were convinced of the loss of his\r\naddress. As they were without the means required to mourn and bury Cave\r\nin the elaborate style the dignity of an old Seven Dials inhabitant\r\ndemands, they had appealed to a friendly fellow-tradesman in Great\r\nPortland Street. He had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at\r\na valuation. The valuation was his own and the crystal egg was included\r\nin one of the lots. Mr. Wace, after a few suitable consolatory\r\nobservations, a little off-handedly proffered perhaps, hurried at once\r\nto Great Portland Street. But there he learned that the crystal egg had\r\nalready been sold to a tall, dark man in grey. And there the material\r\nfacts in this curious, and to me at least very suggestive, story come\r\nabruptly to an end. The Great Portland Street dealer did not know who\r\nthe tall dark man in grey was, nor had he observed him with sufficient\r\nattention to describe him minutely. He did not even know which way this\r\nperson had gone after leaving the shop. For a time Mr. Wace remained in\r\nthe shop, trying the dealer's patience with hopeless questions, venting\r\nhis own exasperation. And at last, realising abruptly that the whole\r\nthing had passed out of his hands, had vanished like a vision of the\r\nnight, he returned to his own rooms, a little astonished to find the\r\nnotes he had made still tangible and visible upon his untidy table.\r\n\r\nHis annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great. He made a\r\nsecond call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland Street dealer,\r\nand he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were likely to\r\ncome into the hands of a _bric-a-brac_ collector. He also wrote letters\r\nto _The Daily Chronicle_ and _Nature_, but both those periodicals,\r\nsuspecting a hoax, asked him to reconsider his action before they\r\nprinted, and he was advised that such a strange story, unfortunately so\r\nbare of supporting evidence, might imperil his reputation as an\r\ninvestigator. Moreover, the calls of his proper work were urgent. So\r\nthat after a month or so, save for an occasional reminder to certain\r\ndealers, he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg,\r\nand from that day to this it remains undiscovered. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, he tells me, and I can quite believe him, he has bursts of\r\nzeal, in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material and\r\norigin of it, are things equally speculative at the present time. If\r\nthe present purchaser is a collector, one would have expected the\r\nenquiries of Mr. Wace to have reached him through the dealers. He has\r\nbeen able to discover Mr. Cave's clergyman and \"Oriental\"--no other than\r\nthe Rev. James Parker and the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in Java. I am\r\nobliged to them for certain particulars. The object of the Prince was\r\nsimply curiosity--and extravagance. He was so eager to buy, because Cave\r\nwas so oddly reluctant to sell. It is just as possible that the buyer in\r\nthe second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at\r\nall, and the crystal egg, for all I know, may at the present moment be\r\nwithin a mile of me, decorating a drawing-room or serving as a\r\npaper-weight--its remarkable functions all unknown. Indeed, it is partly\r\nwith the idea of such a possibility that I have thrown this narrative\r\ninto a form that will give it a chance of being read by the ordinary\r\nconsumer of fiction.\r\n\r\nMy own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of Mr.\r\nWace. I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the crystal egg of\r\nMr. Cave's to be in some physical, but at present quite inexplicable,\r\nway _en rapport_, and we both believe further that the terrestrial\r\ncrystal must have been--possibly at some remote date--sent hither from\r\nthat planet, in order to give the Martians a near view of our affairs.\r\nPossibly the fellows to the crystals in the other masts are also on our\r\nglobe. No theory of hallucination suffices for the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Star\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made,\r\nalmost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the\r\nplanet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the\r\nsun, had become very erratic. Ogilvy had already called attention to a\r\nsuspected retardation in its velocity in December. Such a piece of news\r\nwas scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose\r\ninhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor\r\noutside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a\r\nfaint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause\r\nany very great excitement. Scientific people, however, found the\r\nintelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that the new\r\nbody was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its motion was quite\r\ndifferent from the orderly progress of the planets, and that the\r\ndeflection of Neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an\r\nunprecedented kind.\r\n\r\nFew people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation\r\nof the solar system. The sun with its specks of planets, its dust of\r\nplanetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a vacant immensity that\r\nalmost defeats the imagination. Beyond the orbit of Neptune there is\r\nspace, vacant so far as human observation has penetrated, without warmth\r\nor light or sound, blank emptiness, for twenty million times a million\r\nmiles. That is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed\r\nbefore the very nearest of the stars is attained. And, saving a few\r\ncomets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame, no matter had ever to\r\nhuman knowledge crossed this gulf of space, until early in the twentieth\r\ncentury this strange wanderer appeared. A vast mass of matter it was,\r\nbulky, heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the\r\nsky into the radiance of the sun. By the second day it was clearly\r\nvisible to any decent instrument, as a speck with a barely sensible\r\ndiameter, in the constellation Leo near Regulus. In a little while an\r\nopera glass could attain it.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two\r\nhemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance\r\nof this unusual apparition in the heavens. \"A Planetary Collision,\" one\r\nLondon paper headed the news, and proclaimed Duchaine's opinion that\r\nthis strange new planet would probably collide with Neptune. The leader\r\nwriters enlarged upon the topic. So that in most of the capitals of the\r\nworld, on January 3rd, there was an expectation, however vague of some\r\nimminent phenomenon in the sky; and as the night followed the sunset\r\nround the globe, thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see--the\r\nold familiar stars just as they had always been.\r\n\r\nUntil it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars overhead\r\ngrown pale. The Winter's dawn it was, a sickly filtering accumulation of\r\ndaylight, and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows\r\nto show where people were astir. But the yawning policeman saw the\r\nthing, the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape, workmen going to\r\ntheir work betimes, milkmen, the drivers of news-carts, dissipation\r\ngoing home jaded and pale, homeless wanderers, sentinels on their beats,\r\nand in the country, labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking home,\r\nall over the dusky quickening country it could be seen--and out at sea\r\nby seamen watching for the day--a great white star, come suddenly into\r\nthe westward sky!\r\n\r\nBrighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the evening\r\nstar at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large, no mere\r\ntwinkling spot of light, but a small round clear shining disc, an hour\r\nafter the day had come. And where science has not reached, men stared\r\nand feared, telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are\r\nforeshadowed by these fiery signs in the Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky\r\nHottentots, Gold Coast negroes, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood\r\nin the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nAnd in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement,\r\nrising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote bodies had rushed\r\ntogether, and a hurrying to and fro, to gather photographic apparatus\r\nand spectroscope, and this appliance and that, to record this novel\r\nastonishing sight, the destruction of a world. For it was a world, a\r\nsister planet of our earth, far greater than our earth indeed, that had\r\nso suddenly flashed into flaming death. Neptune it was, had been struck,\r\nfairly and squarely, by the strange planet from outer space and the heat\r\nof the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one\r\nvast mass of incandescence. Round the world that day, two hours before\r\nthe dawn, went the pallid great white star, fading only as it sank\r\nwestward and the sun mounted above it. Everywhere men marvelled at it,\r\nbut of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those\r\nsailors, habitual watchers of the stars, who far away at sea had heard\r\nnothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb\r\nzenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnd when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on\r\nhilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring eastward for the\r\nrising of the great new star. It rose with a white glow in front of it,\r\nlike the glare of a white fire, and those who had seen it come into\r\nexistence the night before cried out at the sight of it. \"It is larger,\"\r\nthey cried. \"It is brighter!\" And, indeed the moon a quarter full and\r\nsinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison, but\r\nscarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little\r\ncircle of the strange new star.\r\n\r\n\"It is brighter!\" cried the people clustering in the streets. But in the\r\ndim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one\r\nanother. \"_It is nearer_,\" they said. \"_Nearer!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd voice after voice repeated, \"It is nearer,\" and the clicking\r\ntelegraph took that up, and it trembled along telephone wires, and in a\r\nthousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type. \"It is nearer.\" Men\r\nwriting in offices, struck with a strange realisation, flung down their\r\npens, men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque\r\npossibility in those words, \"It is nearer.\" It hurried along awakening\r\nstreets, it was shouted down the frost-stilled ways of quiet villages,\r\nmen who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in\r\nyellow-lit doorways shouting the news to the passers-by. \"It is nearer.\"\r\nPretty women, flushed and glittering, heard the news told jestingly\r\nbetween the dances, and feigned an intelligent interest they did not\r\nfeel. \"Nearer! Indeed. How curious! How very, very clever people must be\r\nto find out things like that!\"\r\n\r\nLonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to\r\ncomfort themselves--looking skyward. \"It has need to be nearer, for the\r\nnight's as cold as charity. Don't seem much warmth from it if it _is_\r\nnearer, all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a new star to me?\" cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled it out for\r\nhimself--with the great white star, shining broad and bright through the\r\nfrost-flowers of his window. \"Centrifugal, centripetal,\" he said, with\r\nhis chin on his fist. \"Stop a planet in its flight, rob it of its\r\ncentrifugal force, what then? Centripetal has it, and down it falls into\r\nthe sun! And this--!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do _we_ come in the way? I wonder--\"\r\n\r\nThe light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with the later\r\nwatches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again. And it was\r\nnow so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of\r\nitself, hanging huge in the sunset. In a South African city a great man\r\nhad married, and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his\r\nbride. \"Even the skies have illuminated,\" said the flatterer. Under\r\nCapricorn, two negro lovers, daring the wild beasts and evil spirits,\r\nfor love of one another, crouched together in a cane brake where the\r\nfire-flies hovered. \"That is our star,\" they whispered, and felt\r\nstrangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light.\r\n\r\nThe master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers\r\nfrom him. His calculations were already finished. In a small white phial\r\nthere still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and\r\nactive for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit, patient as\r\never, he had given his lecture to his students, and then had come back\r\nat once to this momentous calculation. His face was grave, a little\r\ndrawn and hectic from his drugged activity. For some time he seemed lost\r\nin thought. Then he went to the window, and the blind went up with a\r\nclick. Half way up the sky, over the clustering roofs, chimneys and\r\nsteeples of the city, hung the star.\r\n\r\nHe looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy. \"You\r\nmay kill me,\" he said after a silence. \"But I can hold you--and all the\r\nuniverse for that matter--in the grip of this little brain. I would not\r\nchange. Even now.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the little phial. \"There will be no need of sleep again,\"\r\nhe said. The next day at noon, punctual to the minute, he entered his\r\nlecture theatre, put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was,\r\nand carefully selected a large piece of chalk. It was a joke among his\r\nstudents that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble\r\nin his fingers, and once he had been stricken to impotence by their\r\nhiding his supply. He came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the\r\nrising tiers of young fresh faces, and spoke with his accustomed studied\r\ncommonness of phrasing. \"Circumstances have arisen--circumstances beyond\r\nmy control,\" he said and paused, \"which will debar me from completing\r\nthe course I had designed. It would seem, gentlemen, if I may put the\r\nthing clearly and briefly, that--Man has lived in vain.\"\r\n\r\nThe students glanced at one another. Had they heard aright? Mad? Raised\r\neyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two faces remained\r\nintent upon his calm grey-fringed face. \"It will be interesting,\" he was\r\nsaying, \"to devote this morning to an exposition, so far as I can make\r\nit clear to you, of the calculations that have led me to this\r\nconclusion. Let us assume--\"\r\n\r\nHe turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the way that\r\nwas usual to him. \"What was that about 'lived in vain?'\" whispered one\r\nstudent to another. \"Listen,\" said the other, nodding towards the\r\nlecturer.\r\n\r\nAnd presently they began to understand.\r\n\r\nThat night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion had\r\ncarried it some way across Leo towards Virgo, and its brightness was so\r\ngreat that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose, and every star was\r\nhidden in its turn, save only Jupiter near the zenith, Capella,\r\nAldebaran, Sirius and the pointers of the Bear. It was very white and\r\nbeautiful. In many parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled\r\nit about. It was perceptibly larger; in the clear refractive sky of the\r\ntropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon.\r\nThe frost was still on the ground in England, but the world was as\r\nbrightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight. One could see to read\r\nquite ordinary print by that cold clear light, and in the cities the\r\nlamps burnt yellow and wan.\r\n\r\nAnd everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout\r\nChristendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the countryside\r\nlike the belling of bees in the heather, and this murmurous tumult grew\r\nto a clangour in the cities. It was the tolling of the bells in a\r\nmillion belfry towers and steeples, summoning the people to sleep no\r\nmore, to sin no more, but to gather in their churches and pray. And\r\noverhead, growing larger and brighter, as the earth rolled on its way\r\nand the night passed, rose the dazzling star.\r\n\r\nAnd the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the shipyards\r\nglared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all\r\nnight long. And in all the seas about the civilised lands, ships with\r\nthrobbing engines, and ships with bellying sails, crowded with men and\r\nliving creatures, were standing out to ocean and the north. For already\r\nthe warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over\r\nthe world, and translated into a hundred tongues. The new planet and\r\nNeptune, locked in a fiery embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster\r\nand faster towards the sun. Already every second this blazing mass flew\r\na hundred miles, and every second its terrific velocity increased. As it\r\nflew now, indeed, it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the\r\nearth and scarcely affect it. But near its destined path, as yet only\r\nslightly perturbed, spun the mighty planet Jupiter and his moons\r\nsweeping splendid round the sun. Every moment now the attraction between\r\nthe fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger. And the\r\nresult of that attraction? Inevitably Jupiter would be deflected from\r\nits orbit into an elliptical path, and the burning star, swung by his\r\nattraction wide of its sunward rush, would \"describe a curved path\" and\r\nperhaps collide with, and certainly pass very close to, our earth.\r\n\"Earthquakes, volcanic outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves, floods, and a\r\nsteady rise in temperature to I know not what limit\"--so prophesied the\r\nmaster mathematician.\r\n\r\nAnd overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and livid, blazed\r\nthe star of the coming doom.\r\n\r\nTo many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached, it seemed\r\nthat it was visibly approaching. And that night, too, the weather\r\nchanged, and the frost that had gripped all Central Europe and France\r\nand England softened towards a thaw.\r\n\r\nBut you must not imagine because I have spoken of people praying through\r\nthe night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing towards\r\nmountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because\r\nof the star. As a matter of fact, use and wont still ruled the world,\r\nand save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night,\r\nnine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common\r\noccupations. In all the cities the shops, save one here and there,\r\nopened and closed at their proper hours, the doctor and the undertaker\r\nplied their trades, the workers gathered in the factories, soldiers\r\ndrilled, scholars studied, lovers sought one another, thieves lurked and\r\nfled, politicians planned their schemes. The presses of the newspapers\r\nroared through the nights, and many a priest of this church and that\r\nwould not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish\r\npanic. The newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000--for then,\r\ntoo, people had anticipated the end. The star was no star--mere gas--a\r\ncomet; and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth. There\r\nwas no precedent for such a thing. Common sense was sturdy everywhere,\r\nscornful, jesting, a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful.\r\nThat night, at seven-fifteen by Greenwich time, the star would be at its\r\nnearest to Jupiter. Then the world would see the turn things would take.\r\nThe master mathematician's grim warnings were treated by many as so much\r\nmere elaborate self-advertisement. Common sense at last, a little heated\r\nby argument, signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed. So,\r\ntoo, barbarism and savagery, already tired of the novelty, went about\r\ntheir nightly business, and save for a howling dog here and there, the\r\nbeast world left the star unheeded.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw the star\r\nrise, an hour later it is true, but no larger than it had been the night\r\nbefore, there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master\r\nmathematician--to take the danger as if it had passed.\r\n\r\nBut hereafter the laughter ceased. The star grew--it grew with a\r\nterrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a little\r\nnearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until it had\r\nturned night into a second day. Had it come straight to the earth\r\ninstead of in a curved path, had it lost no velocity to Jupiter, it must\r\nhave leapt the intervening gulf in a day, but as it was it took five\r\ndays altogether to come by our planet. The next night it had become a\r\nthird the size of the moon before it set to English eyes, and the thaw\r\nwas assured. It rose over America near the size of the moon, but\r\nblinding white to look at, and _hot_; and a breath of hot wind blew now\r\nwith its rising and gathering strength, and in Virginia, and Brazil, and\r\ndown the St. Lawrence valley, it shone intermittently through a driving\r\nreek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet lightning, and hail\r\nunprecedented. In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods. And upon\r\nall the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that\r\nnight, and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and\r\nturbid, and soon--in their upper reaches--with swirling trees and the\r\nbodies of beasts and men. They rose steadily, steadily in the ghostly\r\nbrilliance, and came trickling over their banks at last, behind the\r\nflying population of their valleys.\r\n\r\nAnd along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the tides\r\nwere higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the storms\r\ndrove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland, drowning whole\r\ncities. And so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of\r\nthe sun was like the coming of a shadow. The earthquakes began and grew\r\nuntil all down America from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, hillsides\r\nwere sliding, fissures were opening, and houses and walls crumbling to\r\ndestruction. The whole side of Cotopaxi slipped out in one vast\r\nconvulsion, and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift\r\nand liquid that in one day it reached the sea.\r\n\r\nSo the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the Pacific,\r\ntrailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe, and the growing tidal\r\nwave that toiled behind it, frothing and eager, poured over island and\r\nisland and swept them clear of men. Until that wave came at last--in a\r\nblinding light and with the breath of a furnace, swift and terrible it\r\ncame--a wall of water, fifty feet high, roaring hungrily, upon the long\r\ncoasts of Asia, and swept inland across the plains of China. For a space\r\nthe star, hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its\r\nstrength, showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country;\r\ntowns and villages with their pagodas and trees, roads, wide cultivated\r\nfields, millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the\r\nincandescent sky; and then, low and growing, came the murmur of the\r\nflood. And thus it was with millions of men that night--a flight\r\nnowhither, with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant, and\r\nthe flood like a wall swift and white behind. And then death.\r\n\r\nChina was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all the islands\r\nof Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of\r\nthe steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to\r\nsalute its coming. Above was the lava, hot gases and ash, and below the\r\nseething floods, and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the\r\nearthquake shocks. Soon the immemorial snows of Thibet and the Himalaya\r\nwere melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging\r\nchannels upon the plains of Burmah and Hindostan. The tangled summits of\r\nthe Indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places, and below the\r\nhurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that still struggled\r\nfeebly and reflected the blood-red tongues of fire. And in a rudderless\r\nconfusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad river-ways to\r\nthat one last hope of men--the open sea.\r\n\r\nLarger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a terrible\r\nswiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence, and the\r\nwhirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged\r\nincessantly, speckled with storm-tossed ships.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a wonder. It seemed to those who in Europe watched for the\r\nrising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation. In a\r\nthousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither\r\nfrom the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill\r\nwatched for that rising in vain. Hour followed hour through a terrible\r\nsuspense, and the star rose not. Once again men set their eyes upon the\r\nold constellations they had counted lost to them forever. In England it\r\nwas hot and clear overhead, though the ground quivered perpetually, but\r\nin the tropics, Sirius and Capella and Aldebaran showed through a veil\r\nof steam. And when at last the great star rose near ten hours late, the\r\nsun rose close upon it, and in the centre of its white heart was a disc\r\nof black.\r\n\r\nOver Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the\r\nsky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its light had been\r\nveiled. All the plain of India from the mouth of the Indus to the mouths\r\nof the Ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night, out of\r\nwhich rose temples and palaces, mounds and hills, black with people.\r\nEvery minaret was a clustering mass of people, who fell one by one into\r\nthe turbid waters, as heat and terror overcame them. The whole land\r\nseemed a-wailing, and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace\r\nof despair, and a breath of cold wind, and a gathering of clouds, out of\r\nthe cooling air. Men looking up, near blinded, at the star, saw that a\r\nblack disc was creeping across the light. It was the moon, coming\r\nbetween the star and the earth. And even as men cried to God at this\r\nrespite, out of the East with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang\r\nthe sun. And then star, sun and moon rushed together across the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nSo it was that presently, to the European watchers, star and sun rose\r\nclose upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then slower, and\r\nat last came to rest, star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the\r\nzenith of the sky. The moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to\r\nsight in the brilliance of the sky. And though those who were still\r\nalive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that\r\nhunger, fatigue, heat and despair engender, there were still men who\r\ncould perceive the meaning of these signs. Star and earth had been at\r\ntheir nearest, had swung about one another, and the star had passed.\r\nAlready it was receding, swifter and swifter, in the last stage of its\r\nheadlong journey downward into the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the sky, the\r\nthunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all over the earth\r\nwas such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen, and where the\r\nvolcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents\r\nof mud. Everywhere the waters were pouring off the land, leaving\r\nmud-silted ruins, and the earth littered like a storm-worn beach with\r\nall that had floated, and the dead bodies of the men and brutes, its\r\nchildren. For days the water streamed off the land, sweeping away soil\r\nand trees and houses in the way, and piling huge dykes and scooping out\r\nTitanic gullies over the country side. Those were the days of darkness\r\nthat followed the star and the heat. All through them, and for many\r\nweeks and months, the earthquakes continued.\r\n\r\nBut the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering courage\r\nonly slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities, buried granaries,\r\nand sodden fields. Such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time\r\ncame stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the\r\nnew marks and shoals of once familiar ports. And as the storms subsided\r\nmen perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore, and the\r\nsun larger, and the moon, shrunk to a third of its former size, took now\r\nfourscore days between its new and new.\r\n\r\nBut of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of the saving\r\nof laws and books and machines, of the strange change that had come over\r\nIceland and Greenland and the shores of Baffin's Bay, so that the\r\nsailors coming there presently found them green and gracious, and could\r\nscarce believe their eyes, this story does not tell. Nor of the\r\nmovement of mankind now that the earth was hotter, northward and\r\nsouthward towards the poles of the earth. It concerns itself only with\r\nthe coming and the passing of the Star.\r\n\r\nThe Martian astronomers--for there are astronomers on Mars, although\r\nthey are very different beings from men--were naturally profoundly\r\ninterested by these things. They saw them from their own standpoint of\r\ncourse. \"Considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was\r\nflung through our solar system into the sun,\" one wrote, \"it is\r\nastonishing what a little damage the earth, which it missed so narrowly,\r\nhas sustained. All the familiar continental markings and the masses of\r\nthe seas remain intact, and indeed the only difference seems to be a\r\nshrinkage of the white discolouration (supposed to be frozen water)\r\nround either pole.\" Which only shows how small the vastest of human\r\ncatastrophes may seem, at a distance of a few million miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Story of the Stone Age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE STONE AGE\r\n\r\n\r\nI--UGH-LOMI AND UYA\r\n\r\nThis story is of a time beyond the memory of man, before the beginning\r\nof history, a time when one might have walked dryshod from France (as we\r\ncall it now) to England, and when a broad and sluggish Thames flowed\r\nthrough its marshes to meet its father Rhine, flowing through a wide and\r\nlevel country that is under water in these latter days, and which we\r\nknow by the name of the North Sea. In that remote age the valley which\r\nruns along the foot of the Downs did not exist, and the south of Surrey\r\nwas a range of hills, fir-clad on the middle slopes, and snow-capped for\r\nthe better part of the year. The cores of its summits still remain as\r\nLeith Hill, and Pitch Hill, and Hindhead. On the lower slopes of the\r\nrange, below the grassy spaces where the wild horses grazed, were\r\nforests of yew and sweet-chestnut and elm, and the thickets and dark\r\nplaces hid the grizzly bear and the hyæna, and the grey apes clambered\r\nthrough the branches. And still lower amidst the woodland and marsh and\r\nopen grass along the Wey did this little drama play itself out to the\r\nend that I have to tell. Fifty thousand years ago it was, fifty thousand\r\nyears--if the reckoning of geologists is correct.\r\n\r\nAnd in those days the spring-time was as joyful as it is now, and sent\r\nthe blood coursing in just the same fashion. The afternoon sky was blue\r\nwith piled white clouds sailing through it, and the southwest wind came\r\nlike a soft caress. The new-come swallows drove to and fro. The reaches\r\nof the river were spangled with white ranunculus, the marshy places were\r\nstarred with lady's-smock and lit with marsh-mallow wherever the\r\nregiments of the sedges lowered their swords, and the northward-moving\r\nhippopotami, shiny black monsters, sporting clumsily, came floundering\r\nand blundering through it all, rejoicing dimly and possessed with one\r\nclear idea, to splash the river muddy.\r\n\r\nUp the river and well in sight of the hippopotami, a number of little\r\nbuff-coloured animals dabbled in the water. There was no fear, no\r\nrivalry, and no enmity between them and the hippopotami. As the great\r\nbulks came crashing through the reeds and smashed the mirror of the\r\nwater into silvery splashes, these little creatures shouted and\r\ngesticulated with glee. It was the surest sign of high spring. \"Boloo!\"\r\nthey cried. \"Baayah. Boloo!\" They were the children of the men folk, the\r\nsmoke of whose encampment rose from the knoll at the river's bend.\r\nWild-eyed youngsters they were, with matted hair and little broad-nosed\r\nimpish faces, covered (as some children are covered even nowadays) with\r\na delicate down of hair. They were narrow in the loins and long in the\r\narms. And their ears had no lobes, and had little pointed tips, a thing\r\nthat still, in rare instances, survives. Stark-naked vivid little\r\ngipsies, as active as monkeys and as full of chatter, though a little\r\nwanting in words.\r\n\r\nTheir elders were hidden from the wallowing hippopotami by the crest of\r\nthe knoll. The human squatting-place was a trampled area among the dead\r\nbrown fronds of Royal Fern, through which the crosiers of this year's\r\ngrowth were unrolling to the light and warmth. The fire was a\r\nsmouldering heap of char, light grey and black, replenished by the old\r\nwomen from time to time with brown leaves. Most of the men were\r\nasleep--they slept sitting with their foreheads on their knees. They had\r\nkilled that morning a good quarry, enough for all, a deer that had been\r\nwounded by hunting dogs; so that there had been no quarrelling among\r\nthem, and some of the women were still gnawing the bones that lay\r\nscattered about. Others were making a heap of leaves and sticks to feed\r\nBrother Fire when the darkness came again, that he might grow strong and\r\ntall therewith, and guard them against the beasts. And two were piling\r\nflints that they brought, an armful at a time, from the bend of the\r\nriver where the children were at play.\r\n\r\nNone of these buff-skinned savages were clothed, but some wore about\r\ntheir hips rude girdles of adder-skin or crackling undressed hide, from\r\nwhich depended little bags, not made, but torn from the paws of beasts,\r\nand carrying the rudely-dressed flints that were men's chief weapons and\r\ntools. And one woman, the mate of Uya the Cunning Man, wore a wonderful\r\nnecklace of perforated fossils--that others had worn before her. Beside\r\nsome of the sleeping men lay the big antlers of the elk, with the tines\r\nchipped to sharp edges, and long sticks, hacked at the ends with flints\r\ninto sharp points. There was little else save these things and the\r\nsmouldering fire to mark these human beings off from the wild animals\r\nthat ranged the country. But Uya the Cunning did not sleep, but sat with\r\na bone in his hand and scraped busily thereon with a flint, a thing no\r\nanimal would do. He was the oldest man in the tribe, beetle-browed,\r\nprognathous, lank-armed; he had a beard and his cheeks were hairy, and\r\nhis chest and arms were black with thick hair. And by virtue both of his\r\nstrength and cunning he was master of the tribe, and his share was\r\nalways the most and the best.\r\n\r\nEudena had hidden herself among the alders, because she was afraid of\r\nUya. She was still a girl, and her eyes were bright and her smile\r\npleasant to see. He had given her a piece of the liver, a man's piece,\r\nand a wonderful treat for a girl to get; but as she took it the other\r\nwoman with the necklace had looked at her, an evil glance, and Ugh-lomi\r\nhad made a noise in his throat. At that, Uya had looked at him long and\r\nsteadfastly, and Ugh-lomi's face had fallen. And then Uya had looked at\r\nher. She was frightened and she had stolen away, while the feeding was\r\nstill going on, and Uya was busy with the marrow of a bone. Afterwards\r\nhe had wandered about as if looking for her. And now she crouched among\r\nthe alders, wondering mightily what Uya might be doing with the flint\r\nand the bone. And Ugh-lomi was not to be seen.\r\n\r\nPresently a squirrel came leaping through the alders, and she lay so\r\nquiet the little man was within six feet of her before he saw her.\r\nWhereupon he dashed up a stem in a hurry and began to chatter and scold\r\nher. \"What are you doing here,\" he asked, \"away from the other men\r\nbeasts?\" \"Peace,\" said Eudena, but he only chattered more, and then she\r\nbegan to break off the little black cones to throw at him. He dodged and\r\ndefied her, and she grew excited and rose up to throw better, and then\r\nshe saw Uya coming down the knoll. He had seen the movement of her pale\r\narm amidst the thicket--he was very keen-eyed.\r\n\r\nAt that she forgot the squirrel and set off through the alders and reeds\r\nas fast as she could go. She did not care where she went so long as she\r\nescaped Uya. She splashed nearly knee-deep through a swampy place, and\r\nsaw in front of her a slope of ferns--growing more slender and green as\r\nthey passed up out of the light into the shade of the young chestnuts.\r\nShe was soon amidst the trees--she was very fleet of foot, and she ran\r\non and on until the forest was old and the vales great, and the vines\r\nabout their stems where the light came were thick as young trees, and\r\nthe ropes of ivy stout and tight. On she went, and she doubled and\r\ndoubled again, and then at last lay down amidst some ferns in a hollow\r\nplace near a thicket, and listened with her heart beating in her ears.\r\n\r\nShe heard footsteps presently rustling among the dead leaves, far off,\r\nand they died away and everything was still again, except the\r\nscandalising of the midges--for the evening was drawing on--and the\r\nincessant whisper of the leaves. She laughed silently to think the\r\ncunning Uya should go by her. She was not frightened. Sometimes, playing\r\nwith the other girls and lads, she had fled into the wood, though never\r\nso far as this. It was pleasant to be hidden and alone.\r\n\r\nShe lay a long time there, glad of her escape, and then she sat up\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\nIt was a rapid pattering growing louder and coming towards her, and in a\r\nlittle while she could hear grunting noises and the snapping of twigs.\r\nIt was a drove of lean grisly wild swine. She turned about her, for a\r\nboar is an ill fellow to pass too closely, on account of the sideway\r\nslash of his tusks, and she made off slantingly through the trees. But\r\nthe patter came nearer, they were not feeding as they wandered, but\r\ngoing fast--or else they would not overtake her--and she caught the limb\r\nof a tree, swung on to it, and ran up the stem with something of the\r\nagility of a monkey.\r\n\r\nDown below the sharp bristling backs of the swine were already passing\r\nwhen she looked. And she knew the short, sharp grunts they made meant\r\nfear. What were they afraid of? A man? They were in a great hurry for\r\njust a man.\r\n\r\nAnd then, so suddenly it made her grip on the branch tighten\r\ninvoluntarily, a fawn started in the brake and rushed after the swine.\r\nSomething else went by, low and grey, with a long body; she did not know\r\nwhat it was, indeed she saw it only momentarily through the interstices\r\nof the young leaves; and then there came a pause.\r\n\r\nShe remained stiff and expectant, as rigid almost as though she was a\r\npart of the tree she clung to, peering down.\r\n\r\nThen, far away among the trees, clear for a moment, then hidden, then\r\nvisible knee-deep in ferns, then gone again, ran a man. She knew it was\r\nyoung Ugh-lomi by the fair colour of his hair, and there was red upon\r\nhis face. Somehow his frantic flight and that scarlet mark made her feel\r\nsick. And then nearer, running heavily and breathing hard, came another\r\nman. At first she could not see, and then she saw, foreshortened and\r\nclear to her, Uya, running with great strides and his eyes staring. He\r\nwas not going after Ugh-lomi. His face was white. It was Uya--_afraid_!\r\nHe passed, and was still loud hearing, when something else, something\r\nlarge and with grizzled fur, swinging along with soft swift strides,\r\ncame rushing in pursuit of him.\r\n\r\nEudena suddenly became rigid, ceased to breathe, her clutch convulsive,\r\nand her eyes starting.\r\n\r\nShe had never seen the thing before, she did not even see him clearly\r\nnow, but she knew at once it was the Terror of the Woodshade. His name\r\nwas a legend, the children would frighten one another, frighten even\r\nthemselves with his name, and run screaming to the squatting-place. No\r\nman had ever killed any of his kind. Even the mighty mammoth feared his\r\nanger. It was the grizzly bear, the lord of the world as the world went\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nAs he ran he made a continuous growling grumble. \"Men in my very lair!\r\nFighting and blood. At the very mouth of my lair. Men, men, men.\r\nFighting and blood.\" For he was the lord of the wood and of the caves.\r\n\r\nLong after he had passed she remained, a girl of stone, staring down\r\nthrough the branches. All her power of action had gone from her. She\r\ngripped by instinct with hands and knees and feet. It was some time\r\nbefore she could think, and then only one thing was clear in her mind,\r\nthat the Terror was between her and the tribe--that it would be\r\nimpossible to descend.\r\n\r\nPresently when her fear was a little abated she clambered into a more\r\ncomfortable position, where a great branch forked. The trees rose about\r\nher, so that she could see nothing of Brother Fire, who is black by day.\r\nBirds began to stir, and things that had gone into hiding for fear of\r\nher movements crept out....\r\n\r\nAfter a time the taller branches flamed out at the touch of the sunset.\r\nHigh overhead the rooks, who were wiser than men, went cawing home to\r\ntheir squatting-places among the elms. Looking down, things were clearer\r\nand darker. Eudena thought of going back to the squatting-place; she let\r\nherself down some way, and then the fear of the Terror of the Woodshade\r\ncame again. While she hesitated a rabbit squealed dismally, and she\r\ndared not descend farther.\r\n\r\nThe shadows gathered, and the deeps of the forest began stirring. Eudena\r\nwent up the tree again to be nearer the light. Down below the shadows\r\ncame out of their hiding-places and walked abroad. Overhead the blue\r\ndeepened. A dreadful stillness came, and then the leaves began\r\nwhispering.\r\n\r\nEudena shivered and thought of Brother Fire.\r\n\r\nThe shadows now were gathering in the trees, they sat on the branches\r\nand watched her. Branches and leaves were turned to ominous, quiet black\r\nshapes that would spring on her if she stirred. Then the white owl,\r\nflitting silently, came ghostly through the shades. Darker grew the\r\nworld and darker, until the leaves and twigs against the sky were black,\r\nand the ground was hidden.\r\n\r\nShe remained there all night, an age-long vigil, straining her ears for\r\nthe things that went on below in the darkness, and keeping motionless\r\nlest some stealthy beast should discover her. Man in those days was\r\nnever alone in the dark, save for such rare accidents as this. Age after\r\nage he had learnt the lesson of its terror--a lesson we poor children of\r\nhis have nowadays painfully to unlearn. Eudena, though in age a woman,\r\nwas in heart like a little child. She kept as still, poor little animal,\r\nas a hare before it is started.\r\n\r\nThe stars gathered and watched her--her one grain of comfort. In one\r\nbright one she fancied there was something like Ugh-lomi. Then she\r\nfancied it _was_ Ugh-lomi. And near him, red and duller, was Uya, and as\r\nthe night passed Ugh-lomi fled before him up the sky.\r\n\r\nShe tried to see Brother Fire, who guarded the squatting-place from\r\nbeasts, but he was not in sight. And far away she heard the mammoths\r\ntrumpeting as they went down to the drinking-place, and once some huge\r\nbulk with heavy paces hurried along, making a noise like a calf, but\r\nwhat it was she could not see. But she thought from the voice it was\r\nYaaa the rhinoceros, who stabs with his nose, goes always alone, and\r\nrages without cause.\r\n\r\nAt last the little stars began to hide, and then the larger ones. It was\r\nlike all the animals vanishing before the Terror. The Sun was coming,\r\nlord of the sky, as the grizzly was lord of the forest. Eudena wondered\r\nwhat would happen if one star stayed behind. And then the sky paled to\r\nthe dawn.\r\n\r\nWhen the daylight came the fear of lurking things passed, and she could\r\ndescend. She was stiff, but not so stiff as you would have been, dear\r\nyoung lady (by virtue of your upbringing), and as she had not been\r\ntrained to eat at least once in three hours, but instead had often\r\nfasted three days, she did not feel uncomfortably hungry. She crept down\r\nthe tree very cautiously, and went her way stealthily through the wood,\r\nand not a squirrel sprang or deer started but the terror of the grizzly\r\nbear froze her marrow.\r\n\r\nHer desire was now to find her people again. Her dread of Uya the\r\nCunning was consumed by a greater dread of loneliness. But she had lost\r\nher direction. She had run heedlessly overnight, and she could not tell\r\nwhether the squatting-place was sunward or where it lay. Ever and again\r\nshe stopped and listened, and at last, very far away, she heard a\r\nmeasured chinking. It was so faint even in the morning stillness that\r\nshe could tell it must be far away. But she knew the sound was that of a\r\nman sharpening a flint.\r\n\r\nPresently the trees began to thin out, and then came a regiment of\r\nnettles barring the way. She turned aside, and then she came to a fallen\r\ntree that she knew, with a noise of bees about it. And so presently she\r\nwas in sight of the knoll, very far off, and the river under it, and the\r\nchildren and the hippopotami just as they had been yesterday, and the\r\nthin spire of smoke swaying in the morning breeze. Far away by the\r\nriver was the cluster of alders where she had hidden. And at the sight\r\nof that the fear of Uya returned, and she crept into a thicket of\r\nbracken, out of which a rabbit scuttled, and lay awhile to watch the\r\nsquatting-place.\r\n\r\nThe men were mostly out of sight, saving Wau, the flint-chopper; and at\r\nthat she felt safer. They were away hunting food, no doubt. Some of the\r\nwomen, too, were down in the stream, stooping intent, seeking mussels,\r\ncrayfish, and water-snails, and at the sight of their occupation Eudena\r\nfelt hungry. She rose, and ran through the fern, designing to join them.\r\nAs she went she heard a voice among the bracken calling softly. She\r\nstopped. Then suddenly she heard a rustle behind her, and turning, saw\r\nUgh-lomi rising out of the fern. There were streaks of brown blood and\r\ndirt on his face, and his eyes were fierce, and the white stone of Uya,\r\nthe white Fire Stone, that none but Uya dared to touch, was in his hand.\r\nIn a stride he was beside her, and gripped her arm. He swung her about,\r\nand thrust her before him towards the woods. \"Uya,\" he said, and waved\r\nhis arms about. She heard a cry, looked back, and saw all the women\r\nstanding up, and two wading out of the stream. Then came a nearer\r\nhowling, and the old woman with the beard, who watched the fire on the\r\nknoll, was waving her arms, and Wau, the man who had been chipping the\r\nflint, was getting to his feet. The little children too were hurrying\r\nand shouting.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said Ugh-lomi, and dragged her by the arm.\r\n\r\nShe still did not understand.\r\n\r\n\"Uya has called the death word,\" said Ugh-lomi, and she glanced back at\r\nthe screaming curve of figures, and understood.\r\n\r\nWau and all the women and children were coming towards them, a scattered\r\narray of buff shock-headed figures, howling, leaping, and crying. Over\r\nthe knoll two youths hurried. Down among the ferns to the right came a\r\nman, heading them off from the wood. Ugh-lomi left her arm, and the two\r\nbegan running side by side, leaping the bracken and stepping clear and\r\nwide. Eudena, knowing her fleetness and the fleetness of Ugh-lomi,\r\nlaughed aloud at the unequal chase. They were an exceptionally\r\nstraight-limbed couple for those days.\r\n\r\nThey soon cleared the open, and drew near the wood of chestnut-trees\r\nagain--neither afraid now because neither was alone. They slackened\r\ntheir pace, already not excessive. And suddenly Eudena cried and swerved\r\naside, pointing, and looking up through the tree-stems. Ugh-lomi saw\r\nthe feet and legs of men running towards him. Eudena was already running\r\noff at a tangent. And as he too turned to follow her they heard the\r\nvoice of Uya coming through the trees, and roaring out his rage at them.\r\n\r\nThen terror came in their hearts, not the terror that numbs, but the\r\nterror that makes one silent and swift. They were cut off now on two\r\nsides. They were in a sort of corner of pursuit. On the right hand, and\r\nnear by them, came the men swift and heavy, with bearded Uya, antler in\r\nhand, leading them; and on the left, scattered as one scatters corn,\r\nyellow dashes among the fern and grass, ran Wau and the women; and even\r\nthe little children from the shallow had joined the chase. The two\r\nparties converged upon them. Off they went, with Eudena ahead.\r\n\r\nThey knew there was no mercy for them. There was no hunting so sweet to\r\nthese ancient men as the hunting of men. Once the fierce passion of the\r\nchase was lit, the feeble beginnings of humanity in them were thrown to\r\nthe winds. And Uya in the night had marked Ugh-lomi with the death word.\r\nUgh-lomi was the day's quarry, the appointed feast.\r\n\r\nThey ran straight--it was their only chance--taking whatever ground came\r\nin the way--a spread of stinging nettles, an open glade, a clump of\r\ngrass out of which a hyæna fled snarling. Then woods again, long\r\nstretches of shady leaf-mould and moss under the green trunks. Then a\r\nstiff slope, tree-clad, and long vistas of trees, a glade, a succulent\r\ngreen area of black mud, a wide open space again, and then a clump of\r\nlacerating brambles, with beast tracks through it. Behind them the chase\r\ntrailed out and scattered, with Uya ever at their heels. Eudena kept the\r\nfirst place, running light and with her breath easy, for Ugh-lomi\r\ncarried the Fire Stone in his hand.\r\n\r\nIt told on his pace--not at first, but after a time. His footsteps\r\nbehind her suddenly grew remote. Glancing over her shoulder as they\r\ncrossed another open space, Eudena saw that Ugh-lomi was many yards\r\nbehind her, and Uya close upon him, with antler already raised in the\r\nair to strike him down. Wau and the others were but just emerging from\r\nthe shadow of the woods.\r\n\r\nSeeing Ugh-lomi in peril, Eudena ran sideways, looking back, threw up\r\nher arms and cried aloud, just as the antler flew. And young Ugh-lomi,\r\nexpecting this and understanding her cry, ducked his head, so that the\r\nmissile merely struck his scalp lightly, making but a trivial wound, and\r\nflew over him. He turned forthwith, the quartzite Fire Stone in both\r\nhands, and hurled it straight at Uya's body as he ran loose from the\r\nthrow. Uya shouted, but could not dodge it. It took him under the ribs,\r\nheavy and flat, and he reeled and went down without a cry. Ugh-lomi\r\ncaught up the antler--one tine of it was tipped with his own blood--and\r\ncame running on again with a red trickle just coming out of his hair.\r\n\r\nUya rolled over twice, and lay a moment before he got up, and then he\r\ndid not run fast. The colour of his face was changed. Wau overtook him,\r\nand then others, and he coughed and laboured in his breath. But he kept\r\non.\r\n\r\nAt last the two fugitives gained the bank of the river, where the stream\r\nran deep and narrow, and they still had fifty yards in hand of Wau, the\r\nforemost pursuer, the man who made the smiting-stones. He carried one, a\r\nlarge flint, the shape of an oyster and double the size, chipped to a\r\nchisel edge, in either hand.\r\n\r\nThey sprang down the steep bank into the stream, rushed through the\r\nwater, swam the deep current in two or three strokes, and came out\r\nwading again, dripping and refreshed, to clamber up the farther bank.\r\nIt was undermined, and with willows growing thickly therefrom, so that\r\nit needed clambering. And while Eudena was still among the silvery\r\nbranches and Ugh-lomi still in the water--for the antler had encumbered\r\nhim--Wau came up against the sky on the opposite bank, and the\r\nsmiting-stone, thrown cunningly, took the side of Eudena's knee. She\r\nstruggled to the top and fell.\r\n\r\nThey heard the pursuers shout to one another, and Ugh-lomi climbing to\r\nher and moving jerkily to mar Wau's aim, felt the second smiting-stone\r\ngraze his ear, and heard the water splash below him.\r\n\r\nThen it was Ugh-lomi, the stripling, proved himself to have come to\r\nman's estate. For running on, he found Eudena fell behind, limping, and\r\nat that he turned, and crying savagely and with a face terrible with\r\nsudden wrath and trickling blood, ran swiftly past her back to the bank,\r\nwhirling the antler round his head. And Eudena kept on, running stoutly\r\nstill, though she must needs limp at every step, and the pain was\r\nalready sharp.\r\n\r\nSo that Wau, rising over the edge and clutching the straight willow\r\nbranches, saw Ugh-lomi towering over him, gigantic against the blue;\r\nsaw his whole body swing round, and the grip of his hands upon the\r\nantler. The edge of the antler came sweeping through the air, and he saw\r\nno more. The water under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crimson\r\nsix feet down the stream. Uya following stopped knee-high across the\r\nstream, and the man who was swimming turned about.\r\n\r\nThe other men who trailed after--they were none of them very mighty men\r\n(for Uya was more cunning than strong, brooking no sturdy\r\nrivals)--slackened momentarily at the sight of Ugh-lomi standing there\r\nabove the willows, bloody and terrible, between them and the halting\r\ngirl, with the huge antler waving in his hand. It seemed as though he\r\nhad gone into the water a youth, and come out of it a man full grown.\r\n\r\nHe knew what there was behind him. A broad stretch of grass, and then a\r\nthicket, and in that Eudena could hide. That was clear in his mind,\r\nthough his thinking powers were too feeble to see what should happen\r\nthereafter. Uya stood knee-deep, undecided and unarmed. His heavy mouth\r\nhung open, showing his canine teeth, and he panted heavily. His side was\r\nflushed and bruised under the hair. The other man beside him carried a\r\nsharpened stick. The rest of the hunters came up one by one to the top\r\nof the bank, hairy, long-armed men clutching flints and sticks. Two ran\r\noff along the bank down stream, and then clambered to the water, where\r\nWau had come to the surface struggling weakly. Before they could reach\r\nhim he went under again. Two others threatened Ugh-lomi from the bank.\r\n\r\nHe answered back, shouts, vague insults, gestures. Then Uya, who had\r\nbeen hesitating, roared with rage, and whirling his fists plunged into\r\nthe water. His followers splashed after him.\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi glanced over his shoulder and found Eudena already vanished\r\ninto the thicket. He would perhaps have waited for Uya, but Uya\r\npreferred to spar in the water below him until the others were beside\r\nhim. Human tactics in those days, in all serious fighting, were the\r\ntactics of the pack. Prey that turned at bay they gathered around and\r\nrushed. Ugh-lomi felt the rush coming, and hurling the antler at Uya,\r\nturned about and fled.\r\n\r\nWhen he halted to look back from the shadow of the thicket, he found\r\nonly three of his pursuers had followed him across the river, and they\r\nwere going back again. Uya, with a bleeding mouth, was on the farther\r\nside of the stream again, but lower down, and holding his hand to his\r\nside. The others were in the river dragging something to shore. For a\r\ntime at least the chase was intermitted.\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi stood watching for a space, and snarled at the sight of Uya.\r\nThen he turned and plunged into the thicket.\r\n\r\nIn a minute, Eudena came hastening to join him, and they went on hand in\r\nhand. He dimly perceived the pain she suffered from the cut and bruised\r\nknee, and chose the easier ways. But they went on all that day, mile\r\nafter mile, through wood and thicket, until at last they came to the\r\nchalkland, open grass with rare woods of beech, and the birch growing\r\nnear water, and they saw the Wealden mountains nearer, and groups of\r\nhorses grazing together. They went circumspectly, keeping always near\r\nthicket and cover, for this was a strange region--even its ways were\r\nstrange. Steadily the ground rose, until the chestnut forests spread\r\nwide and blue below them, and the Thames marshes shone silvery, high and\r\nfar. They saw no men, for in those days men were still only just come\r\ninto this part of the world, and were moving but slowly along the\r\nriver-ways. Towards evening they came on the river again, but now it ran\r\nin a gorge, between high cliffs of white chalk that sometimes overhung\r\nit. Down the cliffs was a scrub of birches and there were many birds\r\nthere. And high up the cliff was a little shelf by a tree, whereon they\r\nclambered to pass the night.\r\n\r\nThey had had scarcely any food; it was not the time of year for berries,\r\nand they had no time to go aside to snare or waylay. They tramped in a\r\nhungry weary silence, gnawing at twigs and leaves. But over the surface\r\nof the cliffs were a multitude of snails, and in a bush were the freshly\r\nlaid eggs of a little bird, and then Ugh-lomi threw at and killed a\r\nsquirrel in a beech-tree, so that at last they fed well. Ugh-lomi\r\nwatched during the night, his chin on his knees; and he heard young\r\nfoxes crying hard by, and the noise of mammoths down the gorge, and the\r\nhyænas yelling and laughing far away. It was chilly, but they dared not\r\nlight a fire. Whenever he dozed, his spirit went abroad, and straightway\r\nmet with the spirit of Uya, and they fought. And always Ugh-lomi was\r\nparalysed so that he could not smite nor run, and then he would awake\r\nsuddenly. Eudena, too, dreamt evil things of Uya, so that they both\r\nawoke with the fear of him in their hearts, and by the light of the dawn\r\nthey saw a woolly rhinoceros go blundering down the valley.\r\n\r\nDuring the day they caressed one another and were glad of the sunshine,\r\nand Eudena's leg was so stiff she sat on the ledge all day. Ugh-lomi\r\nfound great flints sticking out of the cliff face, greater than any he\r\nhad seen, and he dragged some to the ledge and began chipping, so as to\r\nbe armed against Uya when he came again. And at one he laughed heartily,\r\nand Eudena laughed, and they threw it about in derision. It had a hole\r\nin it. They stuck their fingers through it, it was very funny indeed.\r\nThen they peeped at one another through it. Afterwards, Ugh-lomi got\r\nhimself a stick, and thrusting by chance at this foolish flint, the\r\nstick went in and stuck there. He had rammed it in too tightly to\r\nwithdraw it. That was still stranger--scarcely funny, terrible almost,\r\nand for a time Ugh-lomi did not greatly care to touch the thing. It was\r\nas if the flint had bit and held with its teeth. But then he got\r\nfamiliar with the odd combination. He swung it about, and perceived that\r\nthe stick with the heavy stone on the end struck a better blow than\r\nanything he knew. He went to and fro swinging it, and striking with it;\r\nbut later he tired of it and threw it aside. In the afternoon he went\r\nup over the brow of the white cliff, and lay watching by a rabbit-warren\r\nuntil the rabbits came out to play. There were no men thereabouts, and\r\nthe rabbits were heedless. He threw a smiting-stone he had made and got\r\na kill.\r\n\r\nThat night they made a fire from flint sparks and bracken fronds, and\r\ntalked and caressed by it. And in their sleep Uya's spirit came again,\r\nand suddenly, while Ugh-lomi was trying to fight vainly, the foolish\r\nflint on the stick came into his hand, and he struck Uya with it, and\r\nbehold! it killed him. But afterwards came other dreams of Uya--for\r\nspirits take a lot of killing, and he had to be killed again. Then after\r\nthat the stone would not keep on the stick. He awoke tired and rather\r\ngloomy, and was sulky all the forenoon, in spite of Eudena's kindliness,\r\nand instead of hunting he sat chipping a sharp edge to the singular\r\nflint, and looking strangely at her. Then he bound the perforated flint\r\non to the stick with strips of rabbit skin. And afterwards he walked up\r\nand down the ledge, striking with it, and muttering to himself, and\r\nthinking of Uya. It felt very fine and heavy in the hand.\r\n\r\nSeveral days, more than there was any counting in those days, five days,\r\nit may be, or six, did Ugh-lomi and Eudena stay on that shelf in the\r\ngorge of the river, and they lost all fear of men, and their fire burnt\r\nredly of a night. And they were very merry together; there was food\r\nevery day, sweet water, and no enemies. Eudena's knee was well in a\r\ncouple of days, for those ancient savages had quick-healing flesh.\r\nIndeed, they were very happy.\r\n\r\nOn one of those days Ugh-lomi dropped a chunk of flint over the cliff.\r\nHe saw it fall, and go bounding across the river bank into the river,\r\nand after laughing and thinking it over a little he tried another. This\r\nsmashed a bush of hazel in the most interesting way. They spent all the\r\nmorning dropping stones from the ledge, and in the afternoon they\r\ndiscovered this new and interesting pastime was also possible from the\r\ncliffbrow. The next day they had forgotten this delight. Or at least, it\r\nseemed they had forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut Uya came in dreams to spoil the paradise. Three nights he came\r\nfighting Ugh-lomi. In the morning after these dreams Ugh-lomi would walk\r\nup and down, threatening him and swinging the axe, and at last came the\r\nnight after Ugh-lomi brained the otter, and they had feasted. Uya went\r\ntoo far. Ugh-lomi awoke, scowling under his heavy brows, and he took his\r\naxe, and extending his hand towards Eudena he bade her wait for him\r\nupon the ledge. Then he clambered down the white declivity, glanced up\r\nonce from the foot of it and flourished his axe, and without looking\r\nback again went striding along the river bank until the overhanging\r\ncliff at the bend hid him.\r\n\r\nTwo days and nights did Eudena sit alone by the fire on the ledge\r\nwaiting, and in the night the beasts howled over the cliffs and down the\r\nvalley, and on the cliff over against her the hunched hyænas prowled\r\nblack against the sky. But no evil thing came near her save fear. Once,\r\nfar away, she heard the roaring of a lion, following the horses as they\r\ncame northward over the grass lands with the spring. All that time she\r\nwaited--the waiting that is pain.\r\n\r\nAnd the third day Ugh-lomi came back, up the river. The plumes of a\r\nraven were in his hair. The first axe was red-stained, and had long dark\r\nhairs upon it, and he carried the necklace that had marked the favourite\r\nof Uya in his hand. He walked in the soft places, giving no heed to his\r\ntrail. Save a raw cut below his jaw there was not a wound upon him.\r\n\"Uya!\" cried Ugh-lomi exultant, and Eudena saw it was well. He put the\r\nnecklace on Eudena, and they ate and drank together. And after eating he\r\nbegan to rehearse the whole story from the beginning, when Uya had cast\r\nhis eyes on Eudena, and Uya and Ugh-lomi, fighting in the forest, had\r\nbeen chased by the bear, eking out his scanty words with abundant\r\npantomime, springing to his feet and whirling the stone axe round when\r\nit came to the fighting. The last fight was a mighty one, stamping and\r\nshouting, and once a blow at the fire that sent a torrent of sparks up\r\ninto the night. And Eudena sat red in the light of the fire, gloating on\r\nhim, her face flushed and her eyes shining, and the necklace Uya had\r\nmade about her neck. It was a splendid time, and the stars that look\r\ndown on us looked down on her, our ancestor--who has been dead now these\r\nfifty thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\nII--THE CAVE BEAR\r\n\r\nIn the days when Eudena and Ugh-lomi fled from the people of Uya towards\r\nthe fir-clad mountains of the Weald, across the forests of sweet\r\nchestnut and the grass-clad chalkland, and hid themselves at last in the\r\ngorge of the river between the chalk cliffs, men were few and their\r\nsquatting-places far between. The nearest men to them were those of the\r\ntribe, a full day's journey down the river, and up the mountains there\r\nwere none. Man was indeed a newcomer to this part of the world in that\r\nancient time, coming slowly along the rivers, generation after\r\ngeneration, from one squatting-place to another, from the\r\nsouth-westward. And the animals that held the land, the hippopotamus and\r\nrhinoceros of the river valleys, the horses of the grass plains, the\r\ndeer and swine of the woods, the grey apes in the branches, the cattle\r\nof the uplands, feared him but little--let alone the mammoths in the\r\nmountains and the elephants that came through the land in the\r\nsummer-time out of the south. For why should they fear him, with but the\r\nrough, chipped flints that he had not learnt to haft and which he threw\r\nbut ill, and the poor spear of sharpened wood, as all the weapons he had\r\nagainst hoof and horn, tooth and claw?\r\n\r\nAndoo, the huge cave bear, who lived in the cave up the gorge, had never\r\neven seen a man in all his wise and respectable life, until midway\r\nthrough one night, as he was prowling down the gorge along the cliff\r\nedge, he saw the glare of Eudena's fire upon the ledge, and Eudena red\r\nand shining, and Ugh-lomi, with a gigantic shadow mocking him upon the\r\nwhite cliff, going to and fro, shaking his mane of hair, and waving the\r\naxe of stone--the first axe of stone--while he chanted of the killing\r\nof Uya. The cave bear was far up the gorge, and he saw the thing\r\nslanting-ways and far off. He was so surprised he stood quite still upon\r\nthe edge, sniffing the novel odour of burning bracken, and wondering\r\nwhether the dawn was coming up in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nHe was the lord of the rocks and caves, was the cave bear, as his\r\nslighter brother, the grizzly, was lord of the thick woods below, and as\r\nthe dappled lion--the lion of those days was dappled--was lord of the\r\nthorn-thickets, reed-beds, and open plains. He was the greatest of all\r\nmeat-eaters; he knew no fear, none preyed on him, and none gave him\r\nbattle; only the rhinoceros was beyond his strength. Even the mammoth\r\nshunned his country. This invasion perplexed him. He noticed these new\r\nbeasts were shaped like monkeys, and sparsely hairy like young pigs.\r\n\"Monkey and young pig,\" said the cave bear. \"It might not be so bad. But\r\nthat red thing that jumps, and the black thing jumping with it yonder!\r\nNever in my life have I seen such things before!\"\r\n\r\nHe came slowly along the brow of the cliff towards them, stopping thrice\r\nto sniff and peer, and the reek of the fire grew stronger. A couple of\r\nhyænas also were so intent upon the thing below that Andoo, coming soft\r\nand easy, was close upon them before they knew of him or he of them.\r\nThey started guiltily and went lurching off. Coming round in a wheel, a\r\nhundred yards off, they began yelling and calling him names to revenge\r\nthemselves for the start they had had. \"Ya-ha!\" they cried. \"Who can't\r\ngrub his own burrow? Who eats roots like a pig?... Ya-ha!\" for even in\r\nthose days the hyæna's manners were just as offensive as they are now.\r\n\r\n\"Who answers the hyæna?\" growled Andoo, peering through the midnight\r\ndimness at them, and then going to look at the cliff edge.\r\n\r\nThere was Ugh-lomi still telling his story, and the fire getting low,\r\nand the scent of the burning hot and strong.\r\n\r\nAndoo stood on the edge of the chalk cliff for some time, shifting his\r\nvast weight from foot to foot, and swaying his head to and fro, with his\r\nmouth open, his ears erect and twitching, and the nostrils of his big,\r\nblack muzzle sniffing. He was very curious, was the cave bear, more\r\ncurious than any of the bears that live now, and the flickering fire and\r\nthe incomprehensible movements of the man, let alone the intrusion into\r\nhis indisputable province, stirred him with a sense of strange new\r\nhappenings. He had been after red deer fawn that night, for the cave\r\nbear was a miscellaneous hunter, but this quite turned him from that\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\"Ya-ha!\" yelled the hyænas behind. \"Ya-ha-ha!\"\r\n\r\nPeering through the starlight, Andoo saw there were now three or four\r\ngoing to and fro against the grey hillside. \"They will hang about me now\r\nall the night ... until I kill,\" said Andoo. \"Filth of the world!\" And\r\nmainly to annoy them, he resolved to watch the red flicker in the gorge\r\nuntil the dawn came to drive the hyæna scum home. And after a time they\r\nvanished, and he heard their voices, like a party of Cockney\r\nbeanfeasters, away in the beechwoods. Then they came slinking near\r\nagain. Andoo yawned and went on along the cliff, and they followed. Then\r\nhe stopped and went back.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid night, beset with shining constellations, the same\r\nstars, but not the same constellations we know, for since those days all\r\nthe stars have had time to move into new places. Far away across the\r\nopen space beyond where the heavy-shouldered, lean-bodied hyænas\r\nblundered and howled, was a beechwood, and the mountain slopes rose\r\nbeyond, a dim mystery, until their snow-capped summits came out white\r\nand cold and clear, touched by the first rays of the yet unseen moon. It\r\nwas a vast silence, save when the yell of the hyænas flung a vanishing\r\ndiscordance across its peace, or when from down the hills the trumpeting\r\nof the new-come elephants came faintly on the faint breeze. And below\r\nnow, the red flicker had dwindled and was steady, and shone a deeper\r\nred, and Ugh-lomi had finished his story and was preparing to sleep, and\r\nEudena sat and listened to the strange voices of unknown beasts, and\r\nwatched the dark eastern sky growing deeply luminous at the advent of\r\nthe moon. Down below, the river talked to itself, and things unseen went\r\nto and fro.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the bear went away, but in an hour he was back again. Then,\r\nas if struck by a thought, he turned, and went up the gorge....\r\n\r\nThe night passed, and Ugh-lomi slept on. The waning moon rose and lit\r\nthe gaunt white cliff overhead with a light that was pale and vague. The\r\ngorge remained in a deeper shadow and seemed all the darker. Then by\r\nimperceptible degrees, the day came stealing in the wake of the\r\nmoonlight. Eudena's eyes wandered to the cliff brow overhead once, and\r\nthen again. Each time the line was sharp and clear against the sky, and\r\nyet she had a dim perception of something lurking there. The red of the\r\nfire grew deeper and deeper, grey scales spread upon it, its vertical\r\ncolumn of smoke became more and more visible, and up and down the gorge\r\nthings that had been unseen grew clear in a colourless illumination. She\r\nmay have dozed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she started up from her squatting position, erect and alert,\r\nscrutinising the cliff up and down.\r\n\r\nShe made the faintest sound, and Ugh-lomi too, light-sleeping like an\r\nanimal, was instantly awake. He caught up his axe and came noiselessly\r\nto her side.\r\n\r\nThe light was still dim, the world now all in black and dark grey, and\r\none sickly star still lingered overhead. The ledge they were on was a\r\nlittle grassy space, six feet wide, perhaps, and twenty feet long,\r\nsloping outwardly, and with a handful of St. John's wort growing near\r\nthe edge. Below it the soft, white rock fell away in a steep slope of\r\nnearly fifty feet to the thick bush of hazel that fringed the river.\r\nDown the river this slope increased, until some way off a thin grass\r\nheld its own right up to the crest of the cliff. Overhead, forty or\r\nfifty feet of rock bulged into the great masses characteristic of\r\nchalk, but at the end of the ledge a gully, a precipitous groove of\r\ndiscoloured rock, slashed the face of the cliff, and gave a footing to a\r\nscrubby growth, by which Eudena and Ugh-lomi went up and down.\r\n\r\nThey stood as noiseless as startled deer, with every sense expectant.\r\nFor a minute they heard nothing, and then came a faint rattling of dust\r\ndown the gully, and the creaking of twigs.\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi gripped his axe, and went to the edge of the ledge, for the\r\nbulge of the chalk overhead had hidden the upper part of the gully. And\r\nforthwith, with a sudden contraction of the heart, he saw the cave bear\r\nhalf-way down from the brow, and making a gingerly backward step with\r\nhis flat hind-foot. His hind-quarters were towards Ugh-lomi, and he\r\nclawed at the rocks and bushes so that he seemed flattened against the\r\ncliff. He looked none the less for that. From his shining snout to his\r\nstumpy tail he was a lion and a half, the length of two tall men. He\r\nlooked over his shoulder, and his huge mouth was open with the exertion\r\nof holding up his great carcase, and his tongue lay out....\r\n\r\nHe got his footing, and came down slowly, a yard nearer.\r\n\r\n\"Bear,\" said Ugh-lomi, looking round with his face white.\r\n\r\nBut Eudena, with terror in her eyes, was pointing down the cliff.\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi's mouth fell open. For down below, with her big fore-feet\r\nagainst the rock, stood another big brown-grey bulk--the she-bear. She\r\nwas not so big as Andoo, but she was big enough for all that.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Ugh-lomi gave a cry, and catching up a handful of the\r\nlitter of ferns that lay scattered on the ledge, he thrust it into the\r\npallid ash of the fire. \"Brother Fire!\" he cried, \"Brother Fire!\" And\r\nEudena, starting into activity, did likewise. \"Brother Fire! Help, help!\r\nBrother Fire!\"\r\n\r\nBrother Fire was still red in his heart, but he turned to grey as they\r\nscattered him. \"Brother Fire!\" they screamed. But he whispered and\r\npassed, and there was nothing but ashes. Then Ugh-lomi danced with anger\r\nand struck the ashes with his fist. But Eudena began to hammer the\r\nfirestone against a flint. And the eyes of each were turning ever and\r\nagain towards the gully by which Andoo was climbing down. Brother Fire!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the huge furry hind-quarters of the bear came into view,\r\nbeneath the bulge of the chalk that had hidden him. He was still\r\nclambering gingerly down the nearly vertical surface. His head was yet\r\nout of sight, but they could hear him talking to himself. \"Pig and\r\nmonkey,\" said the cave bear. \"It ought to be good.\"\r\n\r\nEudena struck a spark and blew at it; it twinkled brighter and\r\nthen--went out. At that she cast down flint and firestone and stared\r\nblankly. Then she sprang to her feet and scrambled a yard or so up the\r\ncliff above the ledge. How she hung on even for a moment I do not know,\r\nfor the chalk was vertical and without grip for a monkey. In a couple of\r\nseconds she had slid back to the ledge again with bleeding hands.\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi was making frantic rushes about the ledge--now he would go to\r\nthe edge, now to the gully. He did not know what to do, he could not\r\nthink. The she-bear looked smaller than her mate--much. If they rushed\r\ndown on her together, _one_ might live. \"Ugh?\" said the cave bear, and\r\nUgh-lomi turned again and saw his little eyes peering under the bulge of\r\nthe chalk.\r\n\r\nEudena, cowering at the end of the ledge, began to scream like a gripped\r\nrabbit.\r\n\r\nAt that a sort of madness came upon Ugh-lomi. With a mighty cry, he\r\ncaught up his axe and ran towards Andoo. The monster gave a grunt of\r\nsurprise. In a moment Ugh-lomi was clinging to a bush right underneath\r\nthe bear, and in another he was hanging to its back half buried in fur,\r\nwith one fist clutched in the hair under its jaw. The bear was too\r\nastonished at this fantastic attack to do more than cling passive. And\r\nthen the axe, the first of all axes, rang on its skull.\r\n\r\nThe bear's head twisted from side to side, and he began a petulant\r\nscolding growl. The axe bit within an inch of the left eye, and the hot\r\nblood blinded that side. At that the brute roared with surprise and\r\nanger, and his teeth gnashed six inches from Ugh-lomi's face. Then the\r\naxe, clubbed close, came down heavily on the corner of the jaw.\r\n\r\nThe next blow blinded the right side and called forth a roar, this time\r\nof pain. Eudena saw the huge, flat feet slipping and sliding, and\r\nsuddenly the bear gave a clumsy leap sideways, as if for the ledge. Then\r\neverything vanished, and the hazels smashed, and a roar of pain and a\r\ntumult of shouts and growls came up from far below.\r\n\r\nEudena screamed and ran to the edge and peered over. For a moment, man\r\nand bears were a heap together, Ugh-lomi uppermost; and then he had\r\nsprung clear and was scaling the gully again, with the bears rolling and\r\nstriking at one another among the hazels. But he had left his axe below,\r\nand three knob-ended streaks of carmine were shooting down his thigh.\r\n\"Up!\" he cried, and in a moment Eudena was leading the way to the top of\r\nthe cliff.\r\n\r\nIn half a minute they were at the crest, their hearts pumping noisily,\r\nwith Andoo and his wife far and safe below them. Andoo was sitting on\r\nhis haunches, both paws at work, trying with quick exasperated movements\r\nto wipe the blindness out of his eyes, and the she-bear stood on\r\nall-fours a little way off, ruffled in appearance and growling angrily.\r\nUgh-lomi flung himself flat on the grass, and lay panting and bleeding\r\nwith his face on his arms.\r\n\r\nFor a second Eudena regarded the bears, then she came and sat beside\r\nhim, looking at him....\r\n\r\nPresently she put forth her hand timidly and touched him, and made the\r\nguttural sound that was his name. He turned over and raised himself on\r\nhis arm. His face was pale, like the face of one who is afraid. He\r\nlooked at her steadfastly for a moment, and then suddenly he laughed.\r\n\"Waugh!\" he said exultantly.\r\n\r\n\"Waugh!\" said she--a simple but expressive conversation.\r\n\r\nThen Ugh-lomi came and knelt beside her, and on hands and knees peered\r\nover the brow and examined the gorge. His breath was steady now, and the\r\nblood on his leg had ceased to flow, though the scratches the she-bear\r\nhad made were open and wide. He squatted up and sat staring at the\r\nfootmarks of the great bear as they came to the gully--they were as wide\r\nas his head and twice as long. Then he jumped up and went along the\r\ncliff face until the ledge was visible. Here he sat down for some time\r\nthinking, while Eudena watched him. Presently she saw the bears had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nAt last Ugh-lomi rose, as one whose mind is made up. He returned towards\r\nthe gully, Eudena keeping close by him, and together they clambered to\r\nthe ledge. They took the firestone and a flint, and then Ugh-lomi went\r\ndown to the foot of the cliff very cautiously, and found his axe. They\r\nreturned to the cliff as quietly as they could, and set off at a brisk\r\nwalk. The ledge was a home no longer, with such callers in the\r\nneighbourhood. Ugh-lomi carried the axe and Eudena the firestone. So\r\nsimple was a Palæolithic removal.\r\n\r\nThey went up-stream, although it might lead to the very lair of the\r\ncave bear, because there was no other way to go. Down the stream was the\r\ntribe, and had not Ugh-lomi killed Uya and Wau? By the stream they had\r\nto keep--because of drinking.\r\n\r\nSo they marched through beech trees, with the gorge deepening until the\r\nriver flowed, a frothing rapid, five hundred feet below them. Of all the\r\nchangeful things in this world of change, the courses of rivers in deep\r\nvalleys change least. It was the river Wey, the river we know to-day,\r\nand they marched over the very spots where nowadays stand little\r\nGuildford and Godalming--the first human beings to come into the land.\r\nOnce a grey ape chattered and vanished, and all along the cliff edge,\r\nvast and even, ran the spoor of the great cave bear.\r\n\r\nAnd then the spoor of the bear fell away from the cliff, showing,\r\nUgh-lomi thought, that he came from some place to the left, and keeping\r\nto the cliff's edge, they presently came to an end. They found\r\nthemselves looking down on a great semi-circular space caused by the\r\ncollapse of the cliff. It had smashed right across the gorge, banking\r\nthe up-stream water back in a pool which overflowed in a rapid. The slip\r\nhad happened long ago. It was grassed over, but the face of the cliffs\r\nthat stood about the semicircle was still almost fresh-looking and white\r\nas on the day when the rock must have broken and slid down. Starkly\r\nexposed and black under the foot of these cliffs were the mouths of\r\nseveral caves. And as they stood there, looking at the space, and\r\ndisinclined to skirt it, because they thought the bears' lair lay\r\nsomewhere on the left in the direction they must needs take, they saw\r\nsuddenly first one bear and then two coming up the grass slope to the\r\nright and going across the amphitheatre towards the caves. Andoo was\r\nfirst; he dropped a little on his fore-foot and his mien was despondent,\r\nand the she-bear came shuffling behind.\r\n\r\nEudena and Ugh-lomi stepped back from the cliff until they could just\r\nsee the bears over the verge. Then Ugh-lomi stopped. Eudena pulled his\r\narm, but he turned with a forbidding gesture, and her hand dropped.\r\nUgh-lomi stood watching the bears, with his axe in his hand, until they\r\nhad vanished into the cave. He growled softly, and shook the axe at the\r\nshe-bear's receding quarters. Then to Eudena's terror, instead of\r\ncreeping off with her, he lay flat down and crawled forward into such a\r\nposition that he could just see the cave. It was bears--and he did it\r\nas calmly as if it had been rabbits he was watching!\r\n\r\nHe lay still, like a barked log, sun-dappled, in the shadow of the\r\ntrees. He was thinking. And Eudena had learnt, even when a little girl,\r\nthat when Ugh-lomi became still like that, jaw-bone on fist, novel\r\nthings presently began to happen.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour before the thinking was over; it was noon when the two\r\nlittle savages had found their way to the cliff brow that overhung the\r\nbears' cave. And all the long afternoon they fought desperately with a\r\ngreat boulder of chalk; trundling it, with nothing but their unaided\r\nsturdy muscles, from the gully where it had hung like a loose tooth,\r\ntowards the cliff top. It was full two yards about, it stood as high as\r\nEudena's waist, it was obtuse-angled and toothed with flints. And when\r\nthe sun set it was poised, three inches from the edge, above the cave of\r\nthe great cave bear.\r\n\r\nIn the cave conversation languished during that afternoon. The she-bear\r\nsnoozed sulkily in her corner--for she was fond of pig and monkey--and\r\nAndoo was busy licking the side of his paw and smearing his face to cool\r\nthe smart and inflammation of his wounds. Afterwards he went and sat\r\njust within the mouth of the cave, blinking out at the afternoon sun\r\nwith his uninjured eye, and thinking.\r\n\r\n\"I never was so startled in my life,\" he said at last. \"They are the\r\nmost extraordinary beasts. Attacking _me_!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like them,\" said the she-bear, out of the darkness behind.\r\n\r\n\"A feebler sort of beast I _never_ saw. I can't think what the world is\r\ncoming to. Scraggy, weedy legs.... Wonder how they keep warm in winter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely they don't,\" said the she-bear.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it's a sort of monkey gone wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a change,\" said the she-bear.\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n\"The advantage he had was merely accidental,\" said Andoo. \"These things\r\n_will_ happen at times.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ can't understand why you let go,\" said the she-bear.\r\n\r\nThat matter had been discussed before, and settled. So Andoo, being a\r\nbear of experience, remained silent for a space. Then he resumed upon a\r\ndifferent aspect of the matter. \"He has a sort of claw--a long claw that\r\nhe seemed to have first on one paw and then on the other. Just one claw.\r\nThey're very odd things. The bright thing, too, they seemed to\r\nhave--like that glare that comes in the sky in daytime--only it jumps\r\nabout--it's really worth seeing. It's a thing with a root, too--like\r\ngrass when it is windy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it bite?\" asked the she-bear. \"If it bites it can't be a plant.\"\r\n\r\n\"No----I don't know,\" said Andoo. \"But it's curious, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if they _are_ good eating?\" said the she-bear.\r\n\r\n\"They look it,\" said Andoo, with appetite--for the cave bear, like the\r\npolar bear, was an incurable carnivore--no roots or honey for _him_.\r\n\r\nThe two bears fell into a meditation for a space. Then Andoo resumed his\r\nsimple attentions to his eye. The sunlight up the green slope before the\r\ncave mouth grew warmer in tone and warmer, until it was a ruddy amber.\r\n\r\n\"Curious sort of thing--day,\" said the cave bear. \"Lot too much of it, I\r\nthink. Quite unsuitable for hunting. Dazzles me always. I can't smell\r\nnearly so well by day.\"\r\n\r\nThe she-bear did not answer, but there came a measured crunching sound\r\nout of the darkness. She had turned up a bone. Andoo yawned. \"Well,\" he\r\nsaid. He strolled to the cave mouth and stood with his head projecting,\r\nsurveying the amphitheatre. He found he had to turn his head completely\r\nround to see objects on his right-hand side. No doubt that eye would be\r\nall right to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHe yawned again. There was a tap overhead, and a big mass of chalk flew\r\nout from the cliff face, dropped a yard in front of his nose, and\r\nstarred into a dozen unequal fragments. It startled him extremely.\r\n\r\nWhen he had recovered a little from his shock, he went and sniffed\r\ncuriously at the representative pieces of the fallen projectile. They\r\nhad a distinctive flavour, oddly reminiscent of the two drab animals of\r\nthe ledge. He sat up and pawed the larger lump, and walked round it\r\nseveral times, trying to find a man about it somewhere....\r\n\r\nWhen night had come he went off down the river gorge to see if he could\r\ncut off either of the ledge's occupants. The ledge was empty, there were\r\nno signs of the red thing, but as he was rather hungry he did not loiter\r\nlong that night, but pushed on to pick up a red deer fawn. He forgot\r\nabout the drab animals. He found a fawn, but the doe was close by and\r\nmade an ugly fight for her young. Andoo had to leave the fawn, but as\r\nher blood was up she stuck to the attack, and at last he got in a blow\r\nof his paw on her nose, and so got hold of her. More meat but less\r\ndelicacy, and the she-bear, following, had her share. The next\r\nafternoon, curiously enough, the very fellow of the first white rock\r\nfell, and smashed precisely according to precedent.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the third, that fell the night after, however, was better. It\r\nhit Andoo's unspeculative skull with a crack that echoed up the cliff,\r\nand the white fragments went dancing to all the points of the compass.\r\nThe she-bear coming after him and sniffing curiously at him, found him\r\nlying in an odd sort of attitude, with his head wet and all out of\r\nshape. She was a young she-bear, and inexperienced, and having sniffed\r\nabout him for some time and licked him a little, and so forth, she\r\ndecided to leave him until the odd mood had passed, and went on her\r\nhunting alone.\r\n\r\nShe looked up the fawn of the red doe they had killed two nights ago,\r\nand found it. But it was lonely hunting without Andoo, and she returned\r\ncaveward before dawn. The sky was grey and overcast, the trees up the\r\ngorge were black and unfamiliar, and into her ursine mind came a dim\r\nsense of strange and dreary happenings. She lifted up her voice and\r\ncalled Andoo by name. The sides of the gorge re-echoed her.\r\n\r\nAs she approached the caves she saw in the half light, and heard a\r\ncouple of jackals scuttle off, and immediately after a hyæna howled and\r\na dozen clumsy bulks went lumbering up the slope, and stopped and yelled\r\nderision. \"Lord of the rocks and caves--ya-ha!\" came down the wind. The\r\ndismal feeling in the she-bear's mind became suddenly acute. She\r\nshuffled across the amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n\"Ya-ha!\" said the hyænas, retreating. \"Ya-ha!\"\r\n\r\nThe cave bear was not lying quite in the same attitude, because the\r\nhyænas had been busy, and in one place his ribs showed white. Dotted\r\nover the turf about him lay the smashed fragments of the three great\r\nlumps of chalk. And the air was full of the scent of death.\r\n\r\nThe she-bear stopped dead. Even now, that the great and wonderful Andoo\r\nwas killed was beyond her believing. Then she heard far overhead a\r\nsound, a queer sound, a little like the shout of a hyæna but fuller and\r\nlower in pitch. She looked up, her little dawn-blinded eyes seeing\r\nlittle, her nostrils quivering. And there, on the cliff edge, far above\r\nher against the bright pink of dawn, were two little shaggy round dark\r\nthings, the heads of Eudena and Ugh-lomi, as they shouted derision at\r\nher. But though she could not see them very distinctly she could hear,\r\nand dimly she began to apprehend. A novel feeling as of imminent strange\r\nevils came into her heart.\r\n\r\nShe began to examine the smashed fragments of chalk that lay about\r\nAndoo. For a space she stood still, looking about her and making a low\r\ncontinuous sound that was almost a moan. Then she went back\r\nincredulously to Andoo to make one last effort to rouse him.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII--THE FIRST HORSEMAN\r\n\r\nIn the days before Ugh-lomi there was little trouble between the horses\r\nand men. They lived apart--the men in the river swamps and thickets, the\r\nhorses on the wide grassy uplands between the chestnuts and the pines.\r\nSometimes a pony would come straying into the clogging marshes to make a\r\nflint-hacked meal, and sometimes the tribe would find one, the kill of a\r\nlion, and drive off the jackals, and feast heartily while the sun was\r\nhigh. These horses of the old time were clumsy at the fetlock and\r\ndun-coloured, with a rough tail and big head. They came every\r\nspring-time north-westward into the country, after the swallows and\r\nbefore the hippopotami, as the grass on the wide downland stretches\r\ngrew long. They came only in small bodies thus far, each herd, a\r\nstallion and two or three mares and a foal or so, having its own stretch\r\nof country, and they went again when the chestnut-trees were yellow and\r\nthe wolves came down the Wealden mountains.\r\n\r\nIt was their custom to graze right out in the open, going into cover\r\nonly in the heat of the day. They avoided the long stretches of thorn\r\nand beechwood, preferring an isolated group of trees void of ambuscade,\r\nso that it was hard to come upon them. They were never fighters; their\r\nheels and teeth were for one another, but in the clear country, once\r\nthey were started, no living thing came near them, though perhaps the\r\nelephant might have done so had he felt the need. And in those days man\r\nseemed a harmless thing enough. No whisper of prophetic intelligence\r\ntold the species of the terrible slavery that was to come, of the whip\r\nand spur and bearing-rein, the clumsy load and the slippery street, the\r\ninsufficient food, and the knacker's yard, that was to replace the wide\r\ngrass-land and the freedom of the earth.\r\n\r\nDown in the Wey marshes Ugh-lomi and Eudena had never seen the horses\r\nclosely, but now they saw them every day as the two of them raided out\r\nfrom their lair on the ledge in the gorge, raiding together in search of\r\nfood. They had returned to the ledge after the killing of Andoo; for of\r\nthe she-bear they were not afraid. The she-bear had become afraid of\r\nthem, and when she winded them she went aside. The two went together\r\neverywhere; for since they had left the tribe Eudena was not so much\r\nUgh-lomi's woman as his mate; she learnt to hunt even--as much, that is,\r\nas any woman could. She was indeed a marvellous woman. He would lie for\r\nhours watching a beast, or planning catches in that shock head of his,\r\nand she would stay beside him, with her bright eyes upon him, offering\r\nno irritating suggestions--as still as any man. A wonderful woman!\r\n\r\nAt the top of the cliff was an open grassy lawn and then beechwoods, and\r\ngoing through the beechwoods one came to the edge of the rolling grassy\r\nexpanse, and in sight of the horses. Here, on the edge of the wood and\r\nbracken, were the rabbit-burrows, and here among the fronds Eudena and\r\nUgh-lomi would lie with their throwing-stones ready, until the little\r\npeople came out to nibble and play in the sunset. And while Eudena would\r\nsit, a silent figure of watchfulness, regarding the burrows, Ugh-lomi's\r\neyes were ever away across the greensward at those wonderful grazing\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nIn a dim way he appreciated their grace and their supple nimbleness. As\r\nthe sun declined in the evening-time, and the heat of the day passed,\r\nthey would become active, would start chasing one another, neighing,\r\ndodging, shaking their manes, coming round in great curves, sometimes so\r\nclose that the pounding of the turf sounded like hurried thunder. It\r\nlooked so fine that Ugh-lomi wanted to join in badly. And sometimes one\r\nwould roll over on the turf, kicking four hoofs heavenward, which seemed\r\nformidable and was certainly much less alluring.\r\n\r\nDim imaginings ran through Ugh-lomi's mind as he watched--by virtue of\r\nwhich two rabbits lived the longer. And sleeping, his brains were\r\nclearer and bolder--for that was the way in those days. He came near the\r\nhorses, he dreamt, and fought, smiting-stone against hoof, but then the\r\nhorses changed to men, or, at least, to men with horses' heads, and he\r\nawoke in a cold sweat of terror.\r\n\r\nYet the next day in the morning, as the horses were grazing, one of the\r\nmares whinnied, and they saw Ugh-lomi coming up the wind. They all\r\nstopped their eating and watched him. Ugh-lomi was not coming towards\r\nthem, but strolling obliquely across the open, looking at anything in\r\nthe world but horses. He had stuck three fern-fronds into the mat of his\r\nhair, giving him a remarkable appearance, and he walked very slowly.\r\n\"What's up now?\" said the Master Horse, who was capable, but\r\ninexperienced.\r\n\r\n\"It looks more like the first half of an animal than anything else in\r\nthe world,\" he said. \"Fore-legs and no hind.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only one of those pink monkey things,\" said the Eldest Mare.\r\n\"They're a sort of river monkey. They're quite common on the plains.\"\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi continued his oblique advance. The Eldest Mare was struck with\r\nthe want of motive in his proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" said the Eldest Mare, in a quick conclusive way she had. She\r\nresumed her grazing. The Master Horse and the Second Mare followed suit.\r\n\r\n\"Look! he's nearer,\" said the Foal with a stripe.\r\n\r\nOne of the younger foals made uneasy movements. Ugh-lomi squatted down,\r\nand sat regarding the horses fixedly. In a little while he was\r\nsatisfied that they meant neither flight nor hostilities. He began to\r\nconsider his next procedure. He did not feel anxious to kill, but he had\r\nhis axe with him, and the spirit of sport was upon him. How would one\r\nkill one of these creatures?--these great beautiful creatures!\r\n\r\nEudena, watching him with a fearful admiration from the cover of the\r\nbracken, saw him presently go on all fours, and so proceed again. But\r\nthe horses preferred him a biped to a quadruped, and the Master Horse\r\nthrew up his head and gave the word to move. Ugh-lomi thought they were\r\noff for good, but after a minute's gallop they came round in a wide\r\ncurve, and stood winding him. Then, as a rise in the ground hid him,\r\nthey tailed out, the Master Horse leading, and approached him spirally.\r\n\r\nHe was as ignorant of the possibilities of a horse as they were of his.\r\nAnd at this stage it would seem he funked. He knew this kind of stalking\r\nwould make red deer or buffalo charge, if it were persisted in. At any\r\nrate Eudena saw him jump up and come walking towards her with the fern\r\nplumes held in his hand.\r\n\r\nShe stood up, and he grinned to show that the whole thing was an immense\r\nlark, and that what he had done was just what he had planned to do from\r\nthe very beginning. So that incident ended. But he was very thoughtful\r\nall that day.\r\n\r\nThe next day this foolish drab creature with the leonine mane, instead\r\nof going about the grazing or hunting he was made for, was prowling\r\nround the horses again. The Eldest Mare was all for silent contempt. \"I\r\nsuppose he wants to learn something from us,\" she said, and \"_Let_ him.\"\r\nThe next day he was at it again. The Master Horse decided he meant\r\nabsolutely nothing. But as a matter of fact, Ugh-lomi, the first of men\r\nto feel that curious spell of the horse that binds us even to this day,\r\nmeant a great deal. He admired them unreservedly. There was a rudiment\r\nof the snob in him, I am afraid, and he wanted to be near these\r\nbeautifully-curved animals. Then there were vague conceptions of a kill.\r\nIf only they would let him come near them! But they drew the line, he\r\nfound, at fifty yards. If he came nearer than that they moved off--with\r\ndignity. I suppose it was the way he had blinded Andoo that made him\r\nthink of leaping on the back of one of them. But though Eudena after a\r\ntime came out in the open too, and they did some unobtrusive stalking,\r\nthings stopped there.\r\n\r\nThen one memorable day a new idea came to Ugh-lomi. The horse looks down\r\nand level, but he does not look up. No animals look up--they have too\r\nmuch common-sense. It was only that fantastic creature, man, could waste\r\nhis wits skyward. Ugh-lomi made no philosophical deductions, but he\r\nperceived the thing was so. So he spent a weary day in a beech that\r\nstood in the open, while Eudena stalked. Usually the horses went into\r\nthe shade in the heat of the afternoon, but that day the sky was\r\novercast, and they would not, in spite of Eudena's solicitude.\r\n\r\nIt was two days after that that Ugh-lomi had his desire. The day was\r\nblazing hot, and the multiplying flies asserted themselves. The horses\r\nstopped grazing before midday, and came into the shadow below him, and\r\nstood in couples nose to tail, flapping.\r\n\r\nThe Master Horse, by virtue of his heels, came closest to the tree. And\r\nsuddenly there was a rustle and a creak, a _thud_.... Then a sharp\r\nchipped flint bit him on the cheek. The Master Horse stumbled, came on\r\none knee, rose to his feet, and was off like the wind. The air was full\r\nof the whirl of limbs, the prance of hoofs, and snorts of alarm.\r\nUgh-lomi was pitched a foot in the air, came down again, up again, his\r\nstomach was hit violently, and then his knees got a grip of something\r\nbetween them. He found himself clutching with knees, feet, and hands,\r\ncareering violently with extraordinary oscillation through the air--his\r\naxe gone heaven knows whither. \"Hold tight,\" said Mother Instinct, and\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nHe was aware of a lot of coarse hair in his face, some of it between his\r\nteeth, and of green turf streaming past in front of his eyes. He saw the\r\nshoulder of the Master Horse, vast and sleek, with the muscles flowing\r\nswiftly under the skin. He perceived that his arms were round the neck,\r\nand that the violent jerkings he experienced had a sort of rhythm.\r\n\r\nThen he was in the midst of a wild rush of tree-stems, and then there\r\nwere fronds of bracken about, and then more open turf. Then a stream of\r\npebbles rushing past, little pebbles flying sideways athwart the stream\r\nfrom the blow of the swift hoofs. Ugh-lomi began to feel frightfully\r\nsick and giddy, but he was not the stuff to leave go simply because he\r\nwas uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nHe dared not leave his grip, but he tried to make himself more\r\ncomfortable. He released his hug on the neck, gripping the mane\r\ninstead. He slipped his knees forward, and pushing back, came into a\r\nsitting position where the quarters broaden. It was nervous work, but he\r\nmanaged it, and at last he was fairly seated astride, breathless indeed,\r\nand uncertain, but with that frightful pounding of his body at any rate\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nSlowly the fragments of Ugh-lomi's mind got into order again. The pace\r\nseemed to him terrific, but a kind of exultation was beginning to oust\r\nhis first frantic terror. The air rushed by, sweet and wonderful, the\r\nrhythm of the hoofs changed and broke up and returned into itself again.\r\nThey were on turf now, a wide glade--the beech-trees a hundred yards\r\naway on either side, and a succulent band of green starred with pink\r\nblossom and shot with silver water here and there, meandered down the\r\nmiddle. Far off was a glimpse of blue valley--far away. The exultation\r\ngrew. It was man's first taste of pace.\r\n\r\nThen came a wide space dappled with flying fallow deer scattering this\r\nway and that, and then a couple of jackals, mistaking Ugh-lomi for a\r\nlion, came hurrying after him. And when they saw it was not a lion they\r\nstill came on out of curiosity. On galloped the horse, with his one\r\nidea of escape, and after him the jackals, with pricked ears and\r\nquickly-barked remarks. \"Which kills which?\" said the first jackal.\r\n\"It's the horse being killed,\" said the second. They gave the howl of\r\nfollowing, and the horse answered to it as a horse answers nowadays to\r\nthe spur.\r\n\r\nOn they rushed, a little tornado through the quiet day, putting up\r\nstartled birds, sending a dozen unexpected things darting to cover,\r\nraising a myriad of indignant dung-flies, smashing little blossoms,\r\nflowering complacently, back into their parental turf. Trees again, and\r\nthen splash, splash across a torrent; then a hare shot out of a tuft of\r\ngrass under the very hoofs of the Master Horse, and the jackals left\r\nthem incontinently. So presently they broke into the open again, a wide\r\nexpanse of turfy hillside--the very grassy downs that fall northward\r\nnowadays from the Epsom Stand.\r\n\r\nThe first hot bolt of the Master Horse was long since over. He was\r\nfalling into a measured trot, and Ugh-lomi, albeit bruised exceedingly\r\nand quite uncertain of the future, was in a state of glorious enjoyment.\r\nAnd now came a new development. The pace broke again, the Master Horse\r\ncame round on a short curve, and stopped dead....\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi became alert. He wished he had a flint, but the throwing-flint\r\nhe had carried in a thong about his waist was--like the axe--heaven\r\nknows where. The Master Horse turned his head, and Ugh-lomi became aware\r\nof an eye and teeth. He whipped his leg into a position of security, and\r\nhit at the cheek with his fist. Then the head went down somewhere out of\r\nexistence apparently, and the back he was sitting on flew up into a\r\ndome. Ugh-lomi became a thing of instinct again--strictly prehensile; he\r\nheld by knees and feet, and his head seemed sliding towards the turf.\r\nHis fingers were twisted into the shock of mane, and the rough hair of\r\nthe horse saved him. The gradient he was on lowered again, and\r\nthen--\"Whup!\" said Ugh-lomi astonished, and the slant was the other way\r\nup. But Ugh-lomi was a thousand generations nearer the primordial than\r\nman: no monkey could have held on better. And the lion had been training\r\nthe horse for countless generations against the tactics of rolling and\r\nrearing back. But he kicked like a master, and buck-jumped rather\r\nneatly. In five minutes Ugh-lomi lived a lifetime. If he came off the\r\nhorse would kill him, he felt assured.\r\n\r\nThen the Master Horse decided to stick to his old tactics again, and\r\nsuddenly went off at a gallop. He headed down the slope, taking the\r\nsteep places at a rush, swerving neither to the right nor to the left,\r\nand, as they rode down, the wide expanse of valley sank out of sight\r\nbehind the approaching skirmishers of oak and hawthorn. They skirted a\r\nsudden hollow with the pool of a spring, rank weeds and silver bushes.\r\nThe ground grew softer and the grass taller, and on the right-hand side\r\nand the left came scattered bushes of May--still splashed with belated\r\nblossom. Presently the bushes thickened until they lashed the passing\r\nrider, and little flashes and gouts of blood came out on horse and man.\r\nThen the way opened again.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a wonderful adventure. A sudden squeal of unreasonable\r\nanger rose amidst the bushes, the squeal of some creature bitterly\r\nwronged. And crashing after them appeared a big, grey-blue shape. It was\r\nYaaa the big-horned rhinoceros, in one of those fits of fury of his,\r\ncharging full tilt, after the manner of his kind. He had been startled\r\nat his feeding, and someone, it did not matter who, was to be ripped and\r\ntrampled therefore. He was bearing down on them from the left, with his\r\nwicked little eye red, his great horn down and his tail like a\r\njury-mast behind him. For a minute Ugh-lomi was minded to slip off and\r\ndodge, and then behold! the staccato of the hoofs grew swifter, and the\r\nrhinoceros and his stumpy hurrying little legs seemed to slide out at\r\nthe back corner of Ugh-lomi's eye. In two minutes they were through the\r\nbushes of May, and out in the open, going fast. For a space he could\r\nhear the ponderous paces in pursuit receding behind him, and then it was\r\njust as if Yaaa had not lost his temper, as if Yaaa had never existed.\r\n\r\nThe pace never faltered, on they rode and on.\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi was now all exultation. To exult in those days was to insult.\r\n\"Ya-ha! big nose!\" he said, trying to crane back and see some remote\r\nspeck of a pursuer. \"Why don't you carry your smiting-stone in your\r\nfist?\" he ended with a frantic whoop.\r\n\r\nBut that whoop was unfortunate, for coming close to the ear of the\r\nhorse, and being quite unexpected, it startled the stallion extremely.\r\nHe shied violently. Ugh-lomi suddenly found himself uncomfortable again.\r\nHe was hanging on to the horse, he found, by one arm and one knee.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the ride was honourable but unpleasant. The view was\r\nchiefly of blue sky, and that was combined with the most unpleasant\r\nphysical sensations. Finally, a bush of thorn lashed him and he let go.\r\n\r\nHe hit the ground with his cheek and shoulder, and then, after a\r\ncomplicated and extraordinarily rapid movement, hit it again with the\r\nend of his backbone. He saw splashes and sparks of light and colour. The\r\nground seemed bouncing about just like the horse had done. Then he found\r\nhe was sitting on turf, six yards beyond the bush. In front of him was a\r\nspace of grass, growing greener and greener, and a number of human\r\nbeings in the distance, and the horse was going round at a smart gallop\r\nquite a long way off to the right.\r\n\r\nThe human beings were on the opposite side of the river, some still in\r\nthe water, but they were all running away as hard as they could go. The\r\nadvent of a monster that took to pieces was not the sort of novelty they\r\ncared for. For quite a minute Ugh-lomi sat regarding them in a purely\r\nspectacular spirit. The bend of the river, the knoll among the reeds and\r\nroyal ferns, the thin streams of smoke going up to Heaven, were all\r\nperfectly familiar to him. It was the squatting-place of the Sons of\r\nUya, of Uya from whom he had fled with Eudena, and whom he had waylaid\r\nin the chestnut woods and killed with the First Axe.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet, still dazed from his fall, and as he did so the\r\nscattering fugitives turned and regarded him. Some pointed to the\r\nreceding horse and chattered. He walked slowly towards them, staring. He\r\nforgot the horse, he forgot his own bruises, in the growing interest of\r\nthis encounter. There were fewer of them than there had been--he\r\nsupposed the others must have hid--the heap of fern for the night fire\r\nwas not so high. By the flint heaps should have sat Wau--but then he\r\nremembered he had killed Wau. Suddenly brought back to this familiar\r\nscene, the gorge and the bears and Eudena seemed things remote, things\r\ndreamt of.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the bank and stood regarding the tribe. His mathematical\r\nabilities were of the slightest, but it was certain there were fewer.\r\nThe men might be away, but there were fewer women and children. He gave\r\nthe shout of home-coming. His quarrel had been with Uya and Wau--not\r\nwith the others. \"Children of Uya!\" he cried. They answered with his\r\nname, a little fearfully because of the strange way he had come.\r\n\r\nFor a space they spoke together. Then an old woman lifted a shrill\r\nvoice and answered him. \"Our Lord is a Lion.\"\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi did not understand that saying. They answered him again several\r\ntogether, \"Uya comes again. He comes as a Lion. Our Lord is a Lion. He\r\ncomes at night. He slays whom he will. But none other may slay us,\r\nUgh-lomi, none other may slay us.\"\r\n\r\nStill Ugh-lomi did not understand.\r\n\r\n\"Our Lord is a Lion. He speaks no more to men.\"\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi stood regarding them. He had had dreams--he knew that though he\r\nhad killed Uya, Uya still existed. And now they told him Uya was a Lion.\r\n\r\nThe shrivelled old woman, the mistress of the fire-minders, suddenly\r\nturned and spoke softly to those next to her. She was a very old woman\r\nindeed, she had been the first of Uya's wives, and he had let her live\r\nbeyond the age to which it is seemly a woman should be permitted to\r\nlive. She had been cunning from the first, cunning to please Uya and to\r\nget food. And now she was great in counsel. She spoke softly, and\r\nUgh-lomi watched her shrivelled form across the river with a curious\r\ndistaste. Then she called aloud, \"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi.\"\r\n\r\nA girl suddenly lifted up her voice. \"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi,\" she\r\nsaid. And they all began crying, \"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi.\"\r\n\r\nIt was strange how their manner changed after the old woman called.\r\n\r\nHe stood quite still watching them all. It was pleasant to be called,\r\nand the girl who had called first was a pretty one. But she made him\r\nthink of Eudena.\r\n\r\n\"Come over to us, Ugh-lomi,\" they cried, and the voice of the shrivelled\r\nold woman rose above them all. At the sound of her voice his hesitation\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nHe stood on the river bank, Ugh-lomi--Ugh the Thinker--with his thoughts\r\nslowly taking shape. Presently one and then another paused to see what\r\nhe would do. He was minded to go back, he was minded not to. Suddenly\r\nhis fear or his caution got the upper hand. Without answering them he\r\nturned, and walked back towards the distant thorn-trees, the way he had\r\ncome. Forthwith the whole tribe started crying to him again very\r\neagerly. He hesitated and turned, then he went on, then he turned again,\r\nand then once again, regarding them with troubled eyes as they called.\r\nThe last time he took two paces back, before his fear stopped him. They\r\nsaw him stop once more, and suddenly shake his head and vanish among\r\nthe hawthorn-trees.\r\n\r\nThen all the women and children lifted up their voices together, and\r\ncalled to him in one last vain effort.\r\n\r\nFar down the river the reeds were stirring in the breeze, where,\r\nconvenient for his new sort of feeding, the old lion, who had taken to\r\nman-eating, had made his lair.\r\n\r\nThe old woman turned her face that way, and pointed to the hawthorn\r\nthickets. \"Uya,\" she screamed, \"there goes thine enemy! There goes thine\r\nenemy, Uya! Why do you devour us nightly? We have tried to snare him!\r\nThere goes thine enemy, Uya!\"\r\n\r\nBut the lion who preyed upon the tribe was taking his siesta. The cry\r\nwent unheard. That day he had dined on one of the plumper girls, and his\r\nmood was a comfortable placidity. He really did not understand that he\r\nwas Uya or that Ugh-lomi was his enemy.\r\n\r\nSo it was that Ugh-lomi rode the horse, and heard first of Uya the lion,\r\nwho had taken the place of Uya the Master, and was eating up the tribe.\r\nAnd as he hurried back to the gorge his mind was no longer full of the\r\nhorse, but of the thought that Uya was still alive, to slay or be slain.\r\nOver and over again he saw the shrunken band of women and children\r\ncrying that Uya was a lion. Uya was a lion!\r\n\r\nAnd presently, fearing the twilight might come upon him, Ugh-lomi began\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV--UYA THE LION\r\n\r\nThe old lion was in luck. The tribe had a certain pride in their ruler,\r\nbut that was all the satisfaction they got out of it. He came the very\r\nnight that Ugh-lomi killed Uya the Cunning, and so it was they named him\r\nUya. It was the old woman, the fire-minder, who first named him Uya. A\r\nshower had lowered the fires to a glow, and made the night dark. And as\r\nthey conversed together, and peered at one another in the darkness, and\r\nwondered fearfully what Uya would do to them in their dreams now that he\r\nwas dead, they heard the mounting reverberations of the lion's roar\r\nclose at hand. Then everything was still.\r\n\r\nThey held their breath, so that almost the only sounds were the patter\r\nof the rain and the hiss of the raindrops in the ashes. And then, after\r\nan interminable time, a crash, and a shriek of fear, and a growling.\r\nThey sprang to their feet, shouting, screaming, running this way and\r\nthat, but brands would not burn, and in a minute the victim was being\r\ndragged away through the ferns. It was Irk, the brother of Wau.\r\n\r\nSo the lion came.\r\n\r\nThe ferns were still wet from the rain the next night, and he came and\r\ntook Click with the red hair. That sufficed for two nights. And then in\r\nthe dark between the moons he came three nights, night after night, and\r\nthat though they had good fires. He was an old lion with stumpy teeth,\r\nbut very silent and very cool; he knew of fires before; these were not\r\nthe first of mankind that had ministered to his old age. The third night\r\nhe came between the outer fire and the inner, and he leapt the flint\r\nheap, and pulled down Irm the son of Irk, who had seemed like to be the\r\nleader. That was a dreadful night, because they lit great flares of fern\r\nand ran screaming, and the lion missed his hold of Irm. By the glare of\r\nthe fire they saw Irm struggle up, and run a little way towards them,\r\nand then the lion in two bounds had him down again. That was the last of\r\nIrm.\r\n\r\nSo fear came, and all the delight of spring passed out of their lives.\r\nAlready there were five gone out of the tribe, and four nights added\r\nthree more to the number. Food-seeking became spiritless, none knew who\r\nmight go next, and all day the women toiled, even the favourite women,\r\ngathering litter and sticks for the night fires. And the hunters hunted\r\nill: in the warm spring-time hunger came again as though it was still\r\nwinter. The tribe might have moved, had they had a leader, but they had\r\nno leader, and none knew where to go that the lion could not follow\r\nthem. So the old lion waxed fat and thanked heaven for the kindly race\r\nof men. Two of the children and a youth died while the moon was still\r\nnew, and then it was the shrivelled old fire-minder first bethought\r\nherself in a dream of Eudena and Ugh-lomi, and of the way Uya had been\r\nslain. She had lived in fear of Uya all her days, and now she lived in\r\nfear of the lion. That Ugh-lomi could kill Uya for good--Ugh-lomi whom\r\nshe had seen born--was impossible. It was Uya still seeking his enemy!\r\n\r\nAnd then came the strange return of Ugh-lomi, a wonderful animal seen\r\ngalloping far across the river, that suddenly changed into two animals,\r\na horse and a man. Following this portent, the vision of Ugh-lomi on the\r\nfarther bank of the river.... Yes, it was all plain to her. Uya was\r\npunishing them, because they had not hunted down Ugh-lomi and Eudena.\r\n\r\nThe men came straggling back to the chances of the night while the sun\r\nwas still golden in the sky. They were received with the story of\r\nUgh-lomi. She went across the river with them and showed them his spoor\r\nhesitating on the farther bank. Siss the Tracker knew the feet for\r\nUgh-lomi's. \"Uya needs Ugh-lomi,\" cried the old woman, standing on the\r\nleft of the bend, a gesticulating figure of flaring bronze in the\r\nsunset. Her cries were strange sounds, flitting to and fro on the\r\nborderland of speech, but this was the sense they carried: \"The lion\r\nneeds Eudena. He comes night after night seeking Eudena and Ugh-lomi.\r\nWhen he cannot find Eudena and Ugh-lomi, he grows angry and he kills.\r\nHunt Eudena and Ugh-lomi, Eudena whom he pursued, and Ugh-lomi for whom\r\nhe gave the death-word! Hunt Eudena and Ugh-lomi!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to the distant reed-bed, as sometimes she had turned to Uya\r\nin his life. \"Is it not so, my lord?\" she cried. And, as if in answer,\r\nthe tall reeds bowed before a breath of wind.\r\n\r\nFar into the twilight the sound of hacking was heard from the\r\nsquatting-places. It was the men sharpening their ashen spears against\r\nthe hunting of the morrow. And in the night, early before the moon\r\nrose, the lion came and took the girl of Siss the Tracker.\r\n\r\nIn the morning before the sun had risen, Siss the Tracker, and the lad\r\nWau-Hau, who now chipped flints, and One Eye, and Bo, and the\r\nSnail-eater, the two red-haired men, and Cat's-skin and Snake, all the\r\nmen that were left alive of the Sons of Uya, taking their ash spears and\r\ntheir smiting-stones, and with throwing-stones in the beast-paw bags,\r\nstarted forth upon the trail of Ugh-lomi through the hawthorn thickets\r\nwhere Yaaa the Rhinoceros and his brothers were feeding, and up the bare\r\ndownland towards the beechwoods.\r\n\r\nThat night the fires burnt high and fierce, as the waxing moon set, and\r\nthe lion left the crouching women and children in peace.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day, while the sun was still high, the hunters\r\nreturned--all save One Eye, who lay dead with a smashed skull at the\r\nfoot of the ledge. (When Ugh-lomi came back that evening from stalking\r\nthe horses, he found the vultures already busy over him.) And with them\r\nthe hunters brought Eudena bruised and wounded, but alive. That had been\r\nthe strange order of the shrivelled old woman, that she was to be\r\nbrought alive--\"She is no kill for us. She is for Uya the Lion.\" Her\r\nhands were tied with thongs, as though she had been a man, and she came\r\nweary and drooping--her hair over her eyes and matted with blood. They\r\nwalked about her, and ever and again the Snail-eater, whose name she had\r\ngiven, would laugh and strike her with his ashen spear. And after he had\r\nstruck her with his spear, he would look over his shoulder like one who\r\nhad done an over-bold deed. The others, too, looked over their shoulders\r\never and again, and all were in a hurry save Eudena. When the old woman\r\nsaw them coming, she cried aloud with joy.\r\n\r\nThey made Eudena cross the river with her hands tied, although the\r\ncurrent was strong and when she slipped the old woman screamed, first\r\nwith joy and then for fear she might be drowned. And when they had\r\ndragged Eudena to shore, she could not stand for a time, albeit they\r\nbeat her sore. So they let her sit with her feet touching the water, and\r\nher eyes staring before her, and her face set, whatever they might do or\r\nsay. All the tribe came down to the squatting-place, even curly little\r\nHaha, who as yet could scarcely toddle, and stood staring at Eudena and\r\nthe old woman, as now we should stare at some strange wounded beast and\r\nits captor.\r\n\r\nThe old woman tore off the necklace of Uya that was about Eudena's neck,\r\nand put it on herself--she had been the first to wear it. Then she tore\r\nat Eudena's hair, and took a spear from Siss and beat her with all her\r\nmight. And when she had vented the warmth of her heart on the girl she\r\nlooked closely into her face. Eudena's eyes were closed and her features\r\nwere set, and she lay so still that for a moment the old woman feared\r\nshe was dead. And then her nostrils quivered. At that the old woman\r\nslapped her face and laughed and gave the spear to Siss again, and went\r\na little way off from her and began to talk and jeer at her after her\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe old woman had more words than any in the tribe. And her talk was a\r\nterrible thing to hear. Sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently,\r\nand sometimes the shape of her guttural cries was the mere phantom of\r\nthoughts. But she conveyed to Eudena, nevertheless, much of the things\r\nthat were yet to come, of the Lion and of the torment he would do her.\r\n\"And Ugh-lomi! Ha, ha! Ugh-lomi is slain?\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly Eudena's eyes opened and she sat up again, and her look met\r\nthe old woman's fair and level. \"No,\" she said slowly, like one trying\r\nto remember, \"I did not see my Ugh-lomi slain. I did not see my Ugh-lomi\r\nslain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her,\" cried the old woman. \"Tell her--he that killed him. Tell her\r\nhow Ugh-lomi was slain.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked, and all the women and children there looked, from man to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nNone answered her. They stood shame-faced.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her,\" said the old woman. The men looked at one another.\r\n\r\nEudena's face suddenly lit.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her,\" she said. \"Tell her, mighty men! Tell her the killing of\r\nUgh-lomi.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman rose and struck her sharply across her mouth.\r\n\r\n\"We could not find Ugh-lomi,\" said Siss the Tracker, slowly. \"Who hunts\r\ntwo, kills none.\"\r\n\r\nThen Eudena's heart leapt, but she kept her face hard. It was as well,\r\nfor the old woman looked at her sharply, with murder in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThen the old woman turned her tongue upon the men because they had\r\nfeared to go on after Ugh-lomi. She dreaded no one now Uya was slain.\r\nShe scolded them as one scolds children. And they scowled at her, and\r\nbegan to accuse one another. Until suddenly Siss the Tracker raised his\r\nvoice and bade her hold her peace.\r\n\r\nAnd so when the sun was setting they took Eudena and went--though their\r\nhearts sank within them--along the trail the old lion had made in the\r\nreeds. All the men went together. At one place was a group of alders,\r\nand here they hastily bound Eudena where the lion might find her when he\r\ncame abroad in the twilight, and having done so they hurried back until\r\nthey were near the squatting-place. Then they stopped. Siss stopped\r\nfirst and looked back again at the alders. They could see her head even\r\nfrom the squatting-place, a little black shock under the limb of the\r\nlarger tree. That was as well.\r\n\r\nAll the women and children stood watching upon the crest of the mound.\r\nAnd the old woman stood and screamed for the lion to take her whom he\r\nsought, and counselled him on the torments he might do her.\r\n\r\nEudena was very weary now, stunned by beatings and fatigue and sorrow,\r\nand only the fear of the thing that was still to come upheld her. The\r\nsun was broad and blood-red between the stems of the distant chestnuts,\r\nand the west was all on fire; the evening breeze had died to a warm\r\ntranquillity. The air was full of midge swarms, the fish in the river\r\nhard by would leap at times, and now and again a cockchafer would drone\r\nthrough the air. Out of the corner of her eye Eudena could see a part of\r\nthe squatting-knoll, and little figures standing and staring at her.\r\nAnd--a very little sound but very clear--she could hear the beating of\r\nthe firestone. Dark and near to her and still was the reed-fringed\r\nthicket of the lair.\r\n\r\nPresently the firestone ceased. She looked for the sun and found he had\r\ngone, and overhead and growing brighter was the waxing moon. She looked\r\ntowards the thicket of the lair, seeking shapes in the reeds, and then\r\nsuddenly she began to wriggle and wriggle, weeping and calling upon\r\nUgh-lomi.\r\n\r\nBut Ugh-lomi was far away. When they saw her head moving with her\r\nstruggles, they shouted together on the knoll, and she desisted and was\r\nstill. And then came the bats, and the star that was like Ugh-lomi crept\r\nout of its blue hiding-place in the west. She called to it, but softly,\r\nbecause she feared the lion. And all through the coming of the twilight\r\nthe thicket was still.\r\n\r\nSo the dark crept upon Eudena, and the moon grew bright, and the shadows\r\nof things that had fled up the hillside and vanished with the evening\r\ncame back to them short and black. And the dark shapes in the thicket of\r\nreeds and alders where the lion lay, gathered, and a faint stir began\r\nthere. But nothing came out therefrom all through the gathering of the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the squatting-place and saw the fires glowing smoky-red,\r\nand the men and women going to and fro. The other way, over the river, a\r\nwhite mist was rising. Then far away came the whimpering of young foxes\r\nand the yell of a hyæna.\r\n\r\nThere were long gaps of aching waiting. After a long time some animal\r\nsplashed in the water, and seemed to cross the river at the ford beyond\r\nthe lair, but what animal it was she could not see. From the distant\r\ndrinking-pools she could hear the sound of splashing, and the noise of\r\nelephants--so still was the night.\r\n\r\nThe earth was now a colourless arrangement of white reflections and\r\nimpenetrable shadows, under the blue sky. The silvery moon was already\r\nspotted with the filigree crests of the chestnut woods, and over the\r\nshadowy eastward hills the stars were multiplying. The knoll fires were\r\nbright red now, and black figures stood waiting against them. They were\r\nwaiting for a scream.... Surely it would be soon.\r\n\r\nThe night suddenly seemed full of movement. She held her breath. Things\r\nwere passing--one, two, three--subtly sneaking shadows.... Jackals.\r\n\r\nThen a long waiting again.\r\n\r\nThen, asserting itself as real at once over all the sounds her mind had\r\nimagined, came a stir in the thicket, then a vigorous movement. There\r\nwas a snap. The reeds crashed heavily, once, twice, thrice, and then\r\neverything was still save a measured swishing. She heard a low tremulous\r\ngrowl, and then everything was still again. The stillness\r\nlengthened--would it never end? She held her breath; she bit her lips to\r\nstop screaming. Then something scuttled through the undergrowth. Her\r\nscream was involuntary. She did not hear the answering yell from the\r\nmound.\r\n\r\nImmediately the thicket woke up to vigorous movement again. She saw the\r\ngrass stems waving in the light of the setting moon, the alders swaying.\r\nShe struggled violently--her last struggle. But nothing came towards\r\nher. A dozen monsters seemed rushing about in that little place for a\r\ncouple of minutes, and then again came silence. The moon sank behind the\r\ndistant chestnuts and the night was dark.\r\n\r\nThen an odd sound, a sobbing panting, that grew faster and fainter. Yet\r\nanother silence, and then dim sounds and the grunting of some animal.\r\n\r\nEverything was still again. Far away eastwards an elephant trumpeted,\r\nand from the woods came a snarling and yelping that died away.\r\n\r\nIn the long interval the moon shone out again, between the stems of the\r\ntrees on the ridge, sending two great bars of light and a bar of\r\ndarkness across the reedy waste. Then came a steady rustling, a splash,\r\nand the reeds swayed wider and wider apart. And at last they broke open,\r\ncleft from root to crest.... The end had come.\r\n\r\nShe looked to see the thing that had come out of the reeds. For a moment\r\nit seemed certainly the great head and jaw she expected, and then it\r\ndwindled and changed. It was a dark low thing, that remained silent, but\r\nit was not the lion. It became still--everything became still. She\r\npeered. It was like some gigantic frog, two limbs and a slanting body.\r\nIts head moved about searching the shadows....\r\n\r\nA rustle, and it moved clumsily, with a sort of hopping. And as it moved\r\nit gave a low groan.\r\n\r\nThe blood rushing through her veins was suddenly joy. \"_Ugh-lomi!_\" she\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nThe thing stopped. \"_Eudena_,\" he answered softly with pain in his\r\nvoice, and peering into the alders.\r\n\r\nHe moved again, and came out of the shadow beyond the reeds into the\r\nmoonlight. All his body was covered with dark smears. She saw he was\r\ndragging his legs, and that he gripped his axe, the first axe, in one\r\nhand. In another moment he had struggled into the position of all fours,\r\nand had staggered over to her. \"The lion,\" he said in a strange mingling\r\nof exultation and anguish. \"Wau!--I have slain a lion. With my own hand.\r\nEven as I slew the great bear.\" He moved to emphasise his words, and\r\nsuddenly broke off with a faint cry. For a space he did not move.\r\n\r\n\"Let me free,\" whispered Eudena....\r\n\r\nHe answered her no words but pulled himself up from his crawling\r\nattitude by means of the alder stem, and hacked at her thongs with the\r\nsharp edge of his axe. She heard him sob at each blow. He cut away the\r\nthongs about her chest and arms, and then his hand dropped. His chest\r\nstruck against her shoulder and he slipped down beside her and lay\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of her release was easy. Very hastily she freed herself.\r\nShe made one step from the tree, and her head was spinning. Her last\r\nconscious movement was towards him. She reeled, and dropped. Her hand\r\nfell upon his thigh. It was soft and wet, and gave way under her\r\npressure; he cried out at her touch, and writhed and lay still again.\r\n\r\nPresently a dark dog-like shape came very softly through the reeds. Then\r\nstopped dead and stood sniffing, hesitated, and at last turned and slunk\r\nback into the shadows.\r\n\r\nLong was the time they remained there motionless, with the light of the\r\nsetting moon shining on their limbs. Very slowly, as slowly as the\r\nsetting of the moon, did the shadow of the reeds towards the mound flow\r\nover them. Presently their legs were hidden, and Ugh-lomi was but a bust\r\nof silver. The shadow crept to his neck, crept over his face, and so at\r\nlast the darkness of the night swallowed them up.\r\n\r\nThe shadow became full of instinctive stirrings. There was a patter of\r\nfeet, and a faint snarling--the sound of a blow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was little sleep that night for the women and children at the\r\nsquatting-place until they heard Eudena scream. But the men were weary\r\nand sat dozing. When Eudena screamed they felt assured of their safety,\r\nand hurried to get the nearest places to the fires. The old woman\r\nlaughed at the scream, and laughed again because Si, the little friend\r\nof Eudena, whimpered. Directly the dawn came they were all alert and\r\nlooking towards the alders. They could see that Eudena had been taken.\r\nThey could not help feeling glad to think that Uya was appeased. But\r\nacross the minds of the men the thought of Ugh-lomi fell like a shadow.\r\nThey could understand revenge, for the world was old in revenge, but\r\nthey did not think of rescue. Suddenly a hyæna fled out of the thicket,\r\nand came galloping across the reed space. His muzzle and paws were\r\ndark-stained. At that sight all the men shouted and clutched at\r\nthrowing-stones and ran towards him, for no animal is so pitiful a\r\ncoward as the hyæna by day. All men hated the hyæna because he preyed on\r\nchildren, and would come and bite when one was sleeping on the edge of\r\nthe squatting-place. And Cat's-skin, throwing fair and straight, hit the\r\nbrute shrewdly on the flank, whereat the whole tribe yelled with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nAt the noise they made there came a flapping of wings from the lair of\r\nthe lion, and three white-headed vultures rose slowly and circled and\r\ncame to rest amidst the branches of an alder, overlooking the lair. \"Our\r\nlord is abroad,\" said the old woman, pointing. \"The vultures have their\r\nshare of Eudena.\" For a space they remained there, and then first one\r\nand then another dropped back into the thicket.\r\n\r\nThen over the eastern woods, and touching the whole world to life and\r\ncolour, poured, with the exaltation of a trumpet blast, the light of the\r\nrising sun. At the sight of him the children shouted together, and\r\nclapped their hands and began to race off towards the water. Only little\r\nSi lagged behind and looked wonderingly at the alders where she had seen\r\nthe head of Eudena overnight.\r\n\r\nBut Uya, the old lion, was not abroad, but at home, and he lay very\r\nstill, and a little on one side. He was not in his lair, but a little\r\nway from it in a place of trampled grass. Under one eye was a little\r\nwound, the feeble little bite of the first axe. But all the ground\r\nbeneath his chest was ruddy brown with a vivid streak, and in his chest\r\nwas a little hole that had been made by Ugh-lomi's stabbing-spear. Along\r\nhis side and at his neck the vultures had marked their claims. For so\r\nUgh-lomi had slain him, lying stricken under his paw and thrusting\r\nhaphazard at his chest. He had driven the spear in with all his strength\r\nand stabbed the giant to the heart. So it was the reign of the lion, of\r\nthe second incarnation of Uya the Master, came to an end.\r\n\r\nFrom the knoll the bustle of preparation grew, the hacking of spears and\r\nthrowing-stones. None spake the name of Ugh-lomi for fear that it might\r\nbring him. The men were going to keep together, close together, in the\r\nhunting for a day or so. And their hunting was to be Ugh-lomi, lest\r\ninstead he should come a-hunting them.\r\n\r\nBut Ugh-lomi was lying very still and silent, outside the lion's lair,\r\nand Eudena squatted beside him, with the ash spear, all smeared with\r\nlion's blood, gripped in her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nV--THE FIGHT IN THE LION'S THICKET\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi lay still, his back against an alder, and his thigh was a red\r\nmass terrible to see. No civilised man could have lived who had been so\r\nsorely wounded, but Eudena got him thorns to close his wounds, and\r\nsquatted beside him day and night, smiting the flies from him with a fan\r\nof reeds by day, and in the night threatening the hyænas with the first\r\naxe in her hand; and in a little while he began to heal. It was high\r\nsummer, and there was no rain. Little food they had during the first two\r\ndays his wounds were open. In the low place where they hid were no roots\r\nnor little beasts, and the stream, with its water-snails and fish, was\r\nin the open a hundred yards away. She could not go abroad by day for\r\nfear of the tribe, her brothers and sisters, nor by night for fear of\r\nthe beasts, both on his account and hers. So they shared the lion with\r\nthe vultures. But there was a trickle of water near by, and Eudena\r\nbrought him plenty in her hands.\r\n\r\nWhere Ugh-lomi lay was well hidden from the tribe by a thicket of\r\nalders, and all fenced about with bulrushes and tall reeds. The dead\r\nlion he had killed lay near his old lair on a place of trampled reeds\r\nfifty yards away, in sight through the reed-stems, and the vultures\r\nfought each other for the choicest pieces and kept the jackals off him.\r\nVery soon a cloud of flies that looked like bees hung over him, and\r\nUgh-lomi could hear their humming. And when Ugh-lomi's flesh was already\r\nhealing--and it was not many days before that began--only a few bones of\r\nthe lion remained scattered and shining white.\r\n\r\nFor the most part Ugh-lomi sat still during the day, looking before him\r\nat nothing, sometimes he would mutter of the horses and bears and lions,\r\nand sometimes he would beat the ground with the first axe and say the\r\nnames of the tribe--he seemed to have no fear of bringing the tribe--for\r\nhours together. But chiefly he slept, dreaming little because of his\r\nloss of blood and the slightness of his food. During the short summer\r\nnight both kept awake. All the while the darkness lasted things moved\r\nabout them, things they never saw by day. For some nights the hyænas did\r\nnot come, and then one moonless night near a dozen came and fought for\r\nwhat was left of the lion. The night was a tumult of growling, and\r\nUgh-lomi and Eudena could hear the bones snap in their teeth. But they\r\nknew the hyæna dare not attack any creature alive and awake, and so they\r\nwere not greatly afraid.\r\n\r\nOf a daytime Eudena would go along the narrow path the old lion had made\r\nin the reeds until she was beyond the bend, and then she would creep\r\ninto the thicket and watch the tribe. She would lie close by the alders\r\nwhere they had bound her to offer her up to the lion, and thence she\r\ncould see them on the knoll by the fire, small and clear, as she had\r\nseen them that night. But she told Ugh-lomi little of what she saw,\r\nbecause she feared to bring them by their names. For so they believed in\r\nthose days, that naming called.\r\n\r\nShe saw the men prepare stabbing-spears and throwing-stones on the\r\nmorning after Ugh-lomi had slain the lion, and go out to hunt him,\r\nleaving the women and children on the knoll. Little they knew how near\r\nhe was as they tracked off in single file towards the hills, with Siss\r\nthe Tracker leading them. And she watched the women and children, after\r\nthe men had gone, gathering fern-fronds and twigs for the night fire,\r\nand the boys and girls running and playing together. But the very old\r\nwoman made her feel afraid. Towards noon, when most of the others were\r\ndown at the stream by the bend, she came and stood on the hither side of\r\nthe knoll, a gnarled brown figure, and gesticulated so that Eudena could\r\nscarce believe she was not seen. Eudena lay like a hare in its form,\r\nwith shining eyes fixed on the bent witch away there, and presently she\r\ndimly understood it was the lion the old woman was worshipping--the lion\r\nUgh-lomi had slain.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day the hunters came back weary, carrying a fawn, and\r\nEudena watched the feast enviously. And then came a strange thing. She\r\nsaw--distinctly she heard--the old woman shrieking and gesticulating\r\nand pointing towards her. She was afraid, and crept like a snake out of\r\nsight again. But presently curiosity overcame her and she was back at\r\nher spying-place, and as she peered her heart stopped, for there were\r\nall the men, with their weapons in their hands, walking together towards\r\nher from the knoll.\r\n\r\nShe dared not move lest her movement should be seen, but she pressed\r\nherself close to the ground. The sun was low and the golden light was in\r\nthe faces of the men. She saw they carried a piece of rich red meat\r\nthrust through by an ashen stake. Presently they stopped. \"Go on!\"\r\nscreamed the old woman. Cat's-skin grumbled, and they came on, searching\r\nthe thicket with sun-dazzled eyes. \"Here!\" said Siss. And they took the\r\nashen stake with the meat upon it and thrust it into the ground. \"Uya!\"\r\ncried Siss, \"behold thy portion. And Ugh-lomi we have slain. Of a truth\r\nwe have slain Ugh-lomi. This day we slew Ugh-lomi, and to-morrow we will\r\nbring his body to you.\" And the others repeated the words.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other and behind them, and partly turned and began\r\ngoing back. At first they walked half turned to the thicket, then facing\r\nthe mound they walked faster looking over their shoulders, then faster;\r\nsoon they ran, it was a race at last, until they were near the knoll.\r\nThen Siss who was hindmost was first to slacken his pace.\r\n\r\nThe sunset passed and the twilight came, the fires glowed red against\r\nthe hazy blue of the distant chestnut-trees, and the voices over the\r\nmound were merry. Eudena lay scarcely stirring, looking from the mound\r\nto the meat and then to the mound. She was hungry, but she was afraid.\r\nAt last she crept back to Ugh-lomi.\r\n\r\nHe looked round at the little rustle of her approach. His face was in\r\nshadow. \"Have you got me some food?\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe said she could find nothing, but that she would seek further, and\r\nwent back along the lion's path until she could see the mound again, but\r\nshe could not bring herself to take the meat; she had the brute's\r\ninstinct of a snare. She felt very miserable.\r\n\r\nShe crept back at last towards Ugh-lomi and heard him stirring and\r\nmoaning. She turned back to the mound again; then she saw something in\r\nthe darkness near the stake, and peering distinguished a jackal. In a\r\nflash she was brave and angry; she sprang up, cried out, and ran towards\r\nthe offering. She stumbled and fell, and heard the growling of the\r\njackal going off.\r\n\r\nWhen she arose only the ashen stake lay on the ground, the meat was\r\ngone. So she went back, to fast through the night with Ugh-lomi; and\r\nUgh-lomi was angry with her, because she had no food for him; but she\r\ntold him nothing of the things she had seen.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed and they were near starving, when the tribe slew a\r\nhorse. Then came the same ceremony, and a haunch was left on the ashen\r\nstake; but this time Eudena did not hesitate.\r\n\r\nBy acting and words she made Ugh-lomi understand, but he ate most of the\r\nfood before he understood; and then as her meaning passed to him he grew\r\nmerry with his food. \"I am Uya,\" he said; \"I am the Lion. I am the Great\r\nCave Bear, I who was only Ugh-lomi. I am Wau the Cunning. It is well\r\nthat they should feed me, for presently I will kill them all.\"\r\n\r\nThen Eudena's heart was light, and she laughed with him; and afterwards\r\nshe ate what he had left of the horseflesh with gladness.\r\n\r\nAfter that it was he had a dream, and the next day he made Eudena bring\r\nhim the lion's teeth and claws--so much of them as she could find--and\r\nhack him a club of alder. And he put the teeth and claws very cunningly\r\ninto the wood so that the points were outward. Very long it took him,\r\nand he blunted two of the teeth hammering them in, and was very angry\r\nand threw the thing away; but afterwards he dragged himself to where he\r\nhad thrown it and finished it--a club of a new sort set with teeth. That\r\nday there was more meat for them both, an offering to the lion from the\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nIt was one day--more than a hand's fingers of days, more than anyone had\r\nskill to count--after Ugh-lomi had made the club, that Eudena while he\r\nwas asleep was lying in the thicket watching the squatting-place. There\r\nhad been no meat for three days. And the old woman came and worshipped\r\nafter her manner. Now while she worshipped, Eudena's little friend Si\r\nand another, the child of the first girl Siss had loved, came over the\r\nknoll and stood regarding her skinny figure, and presently they began to\r\nmock her. Eudena found this entertaining, but suddenly the old woman\r\nturned on them quickly and saw them. For a moment she stood and they\r\nstood motionless, and then with a shriek of rage, she rushed towards\r\nthem, and all three disappeared over the crest of the knoll.\r\n\r\nPresently the children reappeared among the ferns beyond the shoulder of\r\nthe hill. Little Si ran first, for she was an active girl, and the\r\nother child ran squealing with the old woman close upon her. And over\r\nthe knoll came Siss with a bone in his hand, and Bo and Cat's-skin\r\nobsequiously behind him, each holding a piece of food, and they laughed\r\naloud and shouted to see the old woman so angry. And with a shriek the\r\nchild was caught and the old woman set to work slapping and the child\r\nscreaming, and it was very good after-dinner fun for them. Little Si ran\r\non a little way and stopped at last between fear and curiosity.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly came the mother of the child, with hair streaming, panting,\r\nand with a stone in her hand, and the old woman turned about like a wild\r\ncat. She was the equal of any woman, was the chief of the fire-minders,\r\nin spite of her years; but before she could do anything Siss shouted to\r\nher and the clamour rose loud. Other shock heads came into sight. It\r\nseemed the whole tribe was at home and feasting. But the old woman dared\r\nnot go on wreaking herself on the child Siss befriended.\r\n\r\nEveryone made noises and called names--even little Si. Abruptly the old\r\nwoman let go of the child she had caught and made a swift run at Si for\r\nSi had no friends; and Si, realising her danger when it was almost upon\r\nher, made off headlong, with a faint cry of terror, not heeding whither\r\nshe ran, straight to the lair of the lion. She swerved aside into the\r\nreeds presently, realising now whither she went.\r\n\r\nBut the old woman was a wonderful old woman, as active as she was\r\nspiteful, and she caught Si by the streaming hair within thirty yards of\r\nEudena. All the tribe now was running down the knoll and shouting and\r\nlaughing ready to see the fun.\r\n\r\nThen something stirred in Eudena; something that had never stirred in\r\nher before; and, thinking all of little Si and nothing of her fear, she\r\nsprang up from her ambush and ran swiftly forward. The old woman did not\r\nsee her, for she was busy beating little Si's face with her hand,\r\nbeating with all her heart, and suddenly something hard and heavy struck\r\nher cheek. She went reeling, and saw Eudena with flaming eyes and cheeks\r\nbetween her and little Si. She shrieked with astonishment and terror,\r\nand little Si, not understanding, set off towards the gaping tribe. They\r\nwere quite close now, for the sight of Eudena had driven their fading\r\nfear of the lion out of their heads.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Eudena had turned from the cowering old woman and overtaken\r\nSi. \"Si!\" she cried, \"Si!\" She caught the child up in her arms as it\r\nstopped, pressed the nail-lined face to hers, and turned about to run\r\ntowards her lair, the lair of the old lion. The old woman stood\r\nwaist-high in the reeds, and screamed foul things and inarticulate rage,\r\nbut did not dare to intercept her; and at the bend of the path Eudena\r\nlooked back and saw all the men of the tribe crying to one another and\r\nSiss coming at a trot along the lion's trail.\r\n\r\nShe ran straight along the narrow way through the reeds to the shady\r\nplace where Ugh-lomi sat with his healing thigh, just awakened by the\r\nshouting and rubbing his eyes. She came to him, a woman, with little Si\r\nin her arms. Her heart throbbed in her throat. \"Ugh-lomi!\" she cried,\r\n\"Ugh-lomi, the tribe comes!\"\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi sat staring in stupid astonishment at her and Si.\r\n\r\nShe pointed with Si in one arm. She sought among her feeble store of\r\nwords to explain. She could hear the men calling. Apparently they had\r\nstopped outside. She put down Si and caught up the new club with the\r\nlion's teeth, and put it into Ugh-lomi's hand, and ran three yards and\r\npicked up the first axe.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Ugh-lomi, waving the new club, and suddenly he perceived the\r\noccasion and, rolling over, began to struggle to his feet.\r\n\r\nHe stood but clumsily. He supported himself by one hand against the\r\ntree, and just touched the ground gingerly with the toe of his wounded\r\nleg. In the other hand he gripped the new club. He looked at his healing\r\nthigh; and suddenly the reeds began whispering, and ceased and whispered\r\nagain, and coming cautiously along the track, bending down and holding\r\nhis fire-hardened stabbing-stick of ash in his hand, appeared Siss. He\r\nstopped dead, and his eyes met Ugh-lomi's.\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi forgot he had a wounded leg. He stood firmly on both feet.\r\nSomething trickled. He glanced down and saw a little gout of blood had\r\noozed out along the edge of the healing wound. He rubbed his hand there\r\nto give him the grip of his club, and fixed his eyes again on Siss.\r\n\r\n\"Wau!\" he cried, and sprang forward, and Siss, still stooping and\r\nwatchful, drove his stabbing-stick up very quickly in an ugly thrust. It\r\nripped Ugh-lomi's guarding arm and the club came down in a counter that\r\nSiss was never to understand. He fell, as an ox falls to the pole-axe,\r\nat Ugh-lomi's feet.\r\n\r\nTo Bo it seemed the strangest thing. He had a comforting sense of tall\r\nreeds on either side, and an impregnable rampart, Siss, between him and\r\nany danger. Snail-eater was close behind and there was no danger there.\r\nHe was prepared to shove behind and send Siss to death or victory. That\r\nwas his place as second man. He saw the butt of the spear Siss carried\r\nleap away from him, and suddenly a dull whack and the broad back fell\r\naway forward, and he looked Ugh-lomi in the face over his prostrate\r\nleader. It felt to Bo as if his heart had fallen down a well. He had a\r\nthrowing-stone in one hand and an ashen stabbing-stick in the other. He\r\ndid not live to the end of his momentary hesitation which to use.\r\n\r\nSnail-eater was a readier man, and besides Bo did not fall forward as\r\nSiss had done, but gave at his knees and hips, crumpling up with the\r\ntoothed club upon his head. The Snail-eater drove his spear forward\r\nswift and straight, and took Ugh-lomi in the muscle of the shoulder, and\r\nthen he drove him hard with the smiting-stone in his other hand,\r\nshouting out as he did so. The new club swished ineffectually through\r\nthe reeds. Eudena saw Ugh-lomi come staggering back from the narrow path\r\ninto the open space, tripping over Siss and with a foot of ashen stake\r\nsticking out of him over his arm. And then the Snail-eater, whose name\r\nshe had given, had his final injury from her, as his exultant face came\r\nout of the reeds after his spear. For she swung the first axe swift and\r\nhigh, and hit him fair and square on the temple; and down he went on\r\nSiss at prostrate Ugh-lomi's feet.\r\n\r\nBut before Ugh-lomi could get up, the two red-haired men were tumbling\r\nout of the reeds, spears and smiting-stones ready, and Snake hard behind\r\nthem. One she struck on the neck, but not to fell him, and he blundered\r\naside and spoilt his brother's blow at Ugh-lomi's head. In a moment\r\nUgh-lomi dropped his club and had his assailant by the waist, and had\r\npitched him sideways sprawling. He snatched at his club again and\r\nrecovered it. The man Eudena had hit stabbed at her with his spear as he\r\nstumbled from her blow, and involuntarily she gave ground to avoid him.\r\nHe hesitated between her and Ugh-lomi, half turned, gave a vague cry at\r\nfinding Ugh-lomi so near, and in a moment Ugh-lomi had him by the\r\nthroat, and the club had its third victim. As he went down Ugh-lomi\r\nshouted--no words, but an exultant cry.\r\n\r\nThe other red-haired man was six feet from her with his back to her, and\r\na darker red streaking his head. He was struggling to his feet. She had\r\nan irrational impulse to stop his rising. She flung the axe at him,\r\nmissed, saw his face in profile, and he had swerved beyond little Si,\r\nand was running through the reeds. She had a transitory vision of Snake\r\nstanding in the throat of the path, half turned away from her, and then\r\nshe saw his back. She saw the club whirling through the air, and the\r\nshock head of Ugh-lomi, with blood in the hair and blood upon the\r\nshoulder, vanishing below the reeds in pursuit. Then she heard Snake\r\nscream like a woman.\r\n\r\nShe ran past Si to where the handle of the axe stuck out of a clump of\r\nfern, and turning, found herself panting and alone with three motionless\r\nbodies. The air was full of shouts and screams. For a space she was sick\r\nand giddy, and then it came into her head that Ugh-lomi was being killed\r\nalong the reed-path, and with an inarticulate cry she leapt over the\r\nbody of Bo and hurried after him. Snake's feet lay across the path, and\r\nhis head was among the reeds. She followed the path until it bent round\r\nand opened out by the alders, and thence she saw all that was left of\r\nthe tribe in the open, scattering like dead leaves before a gale, and\r\ngoing back over the knoll. Ugh-lomi was hard upon Cat's-skin.\r\n\r\nBut Cat's-skin was fleet of foot and got away, and so did young Wau-Hau\r\nwhen Ugh-lomi turned upon him, and Ugh-lomi pursued Wau-Hau far beyond\r\nthe knoll before he desisted. He had the rage of battle on him now, and\r\nthe wood thrust through his shoulder stung him like a spur. When she saw\r\nhe was in no danger she stopped running and stood panting, watching the\r\ndistant active figures run up and vanish one by one over the knoll. In a\r\nlittle time she was alone again. Everything had happened very swiftly.\r\nThe smoke of Brother Fire rose straight and steady from the\r\nsquatting-place, just as it had done ten minutes ago, when the old woman\r\nhad stood yonder worshipping the lion.\r\n\r\nAnd after a long time, as it seemed, Ugh-lomi reappeared over the knoll,\r\nand came back to Eudena, triumphant and breathing heavily. She stood,\r\nher hair about her eyes and hot-faced, with the blood-stained axe in her\r\nhand, at the place where the tribe had offered her as a sacrifice to the\r\nlion. \"Wau!\" cried Ugh-lomi at the sight of her, his face alight with\r\nthe fellowship of battle, and he waved his new club, red now and hairy;\r\nand at the sight of his glowing face her tense pose relaxed somewhat,\r\nand she stood sobbing and rejoicing.\r\n\r\nUgh-lomi had a queer unaccountable pang at the sight of her tears; but\r\nhe only shouted \"Wau!\" the louder and shook the axe east and west. He\r\ncalled manfully to her to follow him and turned back, striding, with the\r\nclub swinging in his hand, towards the squatting-place, as if he had\r\nnever left the tribe; and she ceased her weeping and followed quickly as\r\na woman should.\r\n\r\nSo Ugh-lomi and Eudena came back to the squatting-place from which they\r\nhad fled many days before from the face of Uya; and by the\r\nsquatting-place lay a deer half eaten, just as there had been before\r\nUgh-lomi was man or Eudena woman. So Ugh-lomi sat down to eat, and\r\nEudena beside him like a man, and the rest of the tribe watched them\r\nfrom safe hiding-places. And after a time one of the elder girls came\r\nback timorously, carrying little Si in her arms, and Eudena called to\r\nthem by name, and offered them food. But the elder girl was afraid and\r\nwould not come, though Si struggled to come to Eudena. Afterwards, when\r\nUgh-lomi had eaten, he sat dozing, and at last he slept, and slowly the\r\nothers came out of the hiding-places and drew near. And when Ugh-lomi\r\nwoke, save that there were no men to be seen, it seemed as though he had\r\nnever left the tribe.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a thing strange but true: that all through this fight\r\nUgh-lomi forgot that he was lame, and was not lame, and after he had\r\nrested behold! he was a lame man; and he remained a lame man to the end\r\nof his days.\r\n\r\nCat's-skin and the second red-haired man and Wau-Hau, who chipped flints\r\ncunningly, as his father had done before him, fled from the face of\r\nUgh-lomi, and none knew where they hid. But two days after they came and\r\nsquatted a good way off from the knoll among the bracken under the\r\nchestnuts and watched. Ugh-lomi's rage had gone, he moved to go against\r\nthem and did not, and at sundown they went away. That day, too, they\r\nfound the old woman among the ferns, where Ugh-lomi had blundered upon\r\nher when he had pursued Wau-Hau. She was dead and more ugly than ever,\r\nbut whole. The jackals and vultures had tried her and left her;--she was\r\never a wonderful old woman.\r\n\r\nThe next day the three men came again and squatted nearer, and Wau-Hau\r\nhad two rabbits to hold up, and the red-haired man a wood-pigeon, and\r\nUgh-lomi stood before the women and mocked them.\r\n\r\nThe next day they sat again nearer--without stones or sticks, and with\r\nthe same offerings, and Cat's-skin had a trout. It was rare men caught\r\nfish in those days, but Cat's-skin would stand silently in the water for\r\nhours and catch them with his hand. And the fourth day Ugh-lomi suffered\r\nthese three to come to the squatting-place in peace, with the food they\r\nhad with them. Ugh-lomi ate the trout. Thereafter for many moons\r\nUgh-lomi was master and had his will in peace. And on the fulness of\r\ntime he was killed and eaten even as Uya had been slain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Story of the Days to Come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME\r\n\r\n\r\nI--THE CURE FOR LOVE\r\n\r\nThe excellent Mr. Morris was an Englishman, and he lived in the days of\r\nQueen Victoria the Good. He was a prosperous and very sensible man; he\r\nread the _Times_ and went to church, and as he grew towards middle age\r\nan expression of quiet contented contempt for all who were not as\r\nhimself settled on his face. He was one of those people who do\r\neverything that is right and proper and sensible with inevitable\r\nregularity. He always wore just the right and proper clothes, steering\r\nthe narrow way between the smart and the shabby, always subscribed to\r\nthe right charities, just the judicious compromise between ostentation\r\nand meanness, and never failed to have his hair cut to exactly the\r\nproper length.\r\n\r\nEverything that it was right and proper for a man in his position to\r\npossess, he possessed; and everything that it was not right and proper\r\nfor a man in his position to possess, he did not possess.\r\n\r\nAnd among other right and proper possessions, this Mr. Morris had a wife\r\nand children. They were the right sort of wife, and the right sort and\r\nnumber of children, of course; nothing imaginative or highty-flighty\r\nabout any of them, so far as Mr. Morris could see; they wore perfectly\r\ncorrect clothing, neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way, but\r\njust sensible; and they lived in a nice sensible house in the later\r\nVictorian sham Queen Anne style of architecture, with sham\r\nhalf-timbering of chocolate-painted plaster in the gables, Lincrusta\r\nWalton sham carved oak panels, a terrace of terra cotta to imitate\r\nstone, and cathedral glass in the front door. His boys went to good\r\nsolid schools, and were put to respectable professions; his girls, in\r\nspite of a fantastic protest or so, were all married to suitable,\r\nsteady, oldish young men with good prospects. And when it was a fit and\r\nproper thing for him to do so, Mr. Morris died. His tomb was of marble,\r\nand, without any art nonsense or laudatory inscription, quietly\r\nimposing--such being the fashion of his time.\r\n\r\nHe underwent various changes according to the accepted custom in these\r\ncases, and long before this story begins his bones even had become dust,\r\nand were scattered to the four quarters of heaven. And his sons and his\r\ngrandsons and his great-grandsons and his great-great-grandsons, they\r\ntoo were dust and ashes, and were scattered likewise. It was a thing he\r\ncould not have imagined, that a day would come when even his\r\ngreat-great-grandsons would be scattered to the four winds of heaven. If\r\nany one had suggested it to him he would have resented it. He was one of\r\nthose worthy people who take no interest in the future of mankind at\r\nall. He had grave doubts, indeed, if there was any future for mankind\r\nafter he was dead.\r\n\r\nIt seemed quite impossible and quite uninteresting to imagine anything\r\nhappening after he was dead. Yet the thing was so, and when even his\r\ngreat-great-grandson was dead and decayed and forgotten, when the sham\r\nhalf-timbered house had gone the way of all shams, and the _Times_ was\r\nextinct, and the silk hat a ridiculous antiquity, and the modestly\r\nimposing stone that had been sacred to Mr. Morris had been burnt to make\r\nlime for mortar, and all that Mr. Morris had found real and important\r\nwas sere and dead, the world was still going on, and people were still\r\ngoing about it, just as heedless and impatient of the Future, or,\r\nindeed, of anything but their own selves and property, as Mr. Morris had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nAnd, strange to tell, and much as Mr. Morris would have been angered if\r\nany one had foreshadowed it to him, all over the world there were\r\nscattered a multitude of people, filled with the breath of life, in\r\nwhose veins the blood of Mr. Morris flowed. Just as some day the life\r\nwhich is gathered now in the reader of this very story may also be\r\nscattered far and wide about this world, and mingled with a thousand\r\nalien strains, beyond all thought and tracing.\r\n\r\nAnd among the descendants of this Mr. Morris was one almost as sensible\r\nand clear-headed as his ancestor. He had just the same stout, short\r\nframe as that ancient man of the nineteenth century, from whom his name\r\nof Morris--he spelt it Mwres--came; he had the same half-contemptuous\r\nexpression of face. He was a prosperous person, too, as times went, and\r\nhe disliked the \"new-fangled,\" and bothers about the future and the\r\nlower classes, just as much as the ancestral Morris had done. He did not\r\nread the _Times_: indeed, he did not know there ever had been a\r\n_Times_--that institution had foundered somewhere in the intervening\r\ngulf of years; but the phonograph machine, that talked to him as he\r\nmade his toilet of a morning, might have been the voice of a\r\nreincarnated Blowitz when it dealt with the world's affairs. This\r\nphonographic machine was the size and shape of a Dutch clock, and down\r\nthe front of it were electric barometric indicators, and an electric\r\nclock and calendar, and automatic engagement reminders, and where the\r\nclock would have been was the mouth of a trumpet. When it had news the\r\ntrumpet gobbled like a turkey, \"Galloop, galloop,\" and then brayed out\r\nits message as, let us say, a trumpet might bray. It would tell Mwres in\r\nfull, rich, throaty tones about the overnight accidents to the omnibus\r\nflying-machines that plied around the world, the latest arrivals at the\r\nfashionable resorts in Tibet, and of all the great monopolist company\r\nmeetings of the day before, while he was dressing. If Mwres did not like\r\nhearing what it said, he had only to touch a stud, and it would choke a\r\nlittle and talk about something else.\r\n\r\nOf course his toilet differed very much from that of his ancestor. It is\r\ndoubtful which would have been the more shocked and pained to find\r\nhimself in the clothing of the other. Mwres would certainly have sooner\r\ngone forth to the world stark naked than in the silk hat, frock coat,\r\ngrey trousers and watch-chain that had filled Mr. Morris with sombre\r\nself-respect in the past. For Mwres there was no shaving to do: a\r\nskilful operator had long ago removed every hair-root from his face. His\r\nlegs he encased in pleasant pink and amber garments of an air-tight\r\nmaterial, which with the help of an ingenious little pump he distended\r\nso as to suggest enormous muscles. Above this he also wore pneumatic\r\ngarments beneath an amber silk tunic, so that he was clothed in air and\r\nadmirably protected against sudden extremes of heat or cold. Over this\r\nhe flung a scarlet cloak with its edge fantastically curved. On his\r\nhead, which had been skilfully deprived of every scrap of hair, he\r\nadjusted a pleasant little cap of bright scarlet, held on by suction and\r\ninflated with hydrogen, and curiously like the comb of a cock. So his\r\ntoilet was complete; and, conscious of being soberly and becomingly\r\nattired, he was ready to face his fellow-beings with a tranquil eye.\r\n\r\nThis Mwres--the civility of \"Mr.\" had vanished ages ago--was one of the\r\nofficials under the Wind Vane and Waterfall Trust, the great company\r\nthat owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the world, and which pumped\r\nall the water and supplied all the electric energy that people in these\r\nlatter days required. He lived in a vast hotel near that part of London\r\ncalled Seventh Way, and had very large and comfortable apartments on the\r\nseventeenth floor. Households and family life had long since disappeared\r\nwith the progressive refinement of manners; and indeed the steady rise\r\nin rents and land values, the disappearance of domestic servants, the\r\nelaboration of cookery, had rendered the separate domicile of Victorian\r\ntimes impossible, even had any one desired such a savage seclusion. When\r\nhis toilet was completed he went towards one of the two doors of his\r\napartment--there were doors at opposite ends, each marked with a huge\r\narrow pointing one one way and one the other--touched a stud to open it,\r\nand emerged on a wide passage, the centre of which bore chairs and was\r\nmoving at a steady pace to the left. On some of these chairs were seated\r\ngaily-dressed men and women. He nodded to an acquaintance--it was not in\r\nthose days etiquette to talk before breakfast--and seated himself on one\r\nof these chairs, and in a few seconds he had been carried to the doors\r\nof a lift, by which he descended to the great and splendid hall in which\r\nhis breakfast would be automatically served.\r\n\r\nIt was a very different meal from a Victorian breakfast. The rude\r\nmasses of bread needing to be carved and smeared over with animal fat\r\nbefore they could be made palatable, the still recognisable fragments of\r\nrecently killed animals, hideously charred and hacked, the eggs torn\r\nruthlessly from beneath some protesting hen,--such things as these,\r\nthough they constituted the ordinary fare of Victorian times, would have\r\nawakened only horror and disgust in the refined minds of the people of\r\nthese latter days. Instead were pastes and cakes of agreeable and\r\nvariegated design, without any suggestion in colour or form of the\r\nunfortunate animals from which their substance and juices were derived.\r\nThey appeared on little dishes sliding out upon a rail from a little box\r\nat one side of the table. The surface of the table, to judge by touch\r\nand eye, would have appeared to a nineteenth-century person to be\r\ncovered with fine white damask, but this was really an oxidised metallic\r\nsurface, and could be cleaned instantly after a meal. There were\r\nhundreds of such little tables in the hall, and at most of them were\r\nother latter-day citizens singly or in groups. And as Mwres seated\r\nhimself before his elegant repast, the invisible orchestra, which had\r\nbeen resting during an interval, resumed and filled the air with music.\r\n\r\nBut Mwres did not display any great interest either in his breakfast or\r\nthe music; his eye wandered incessantly about the hall, as though he\r\nexpected a belated guest. At last he rose eagerly and waved his hand,\r\nand simultaneously across the hall appeared a tall dark figure in a\r\ncostume of yellow and olive green. As this person, walking amidst the\r\ntables with measured steps, drew near, the pallid earnestness of his\r\nface and the unusual intensity of his eyes became apparent. Mwres\r\nreseated himself and pointed to a chair beside him.\r\n\r\n\"I feared you would never come,\" he said. In spite of the intervening\r\nspace of time, the English language was still almost exactly the same as\r\nit had been in England under Victoria the Good. The invention of the\r\nphonograph and suchlike means of recording sound, and the gradual\r\nreplacement of books by such contrivances, had not only saved the human\r\neyesight from decay, but had also by the establishment of a sure\r\nstandard arrested the process of change in accent that had hitherto been\r\nso inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"I was delayed by an interesting case,\" said the man in green and\r\nyellow. \"A prominent politician--ahem!--suffering from overwork.\" He\r\nglanced at the breakfast and seated himself. \"I have been awake for\r\nforty hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh dear!\" said Mwres: \"fancy that! You hypnotists have your work to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist helped himself to some attractive amber-coloured jelly. \"I\r\nhappen to be a good deal in request,\" he said modestly.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven knows what we should do without you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! we're not so indispensable as all that,\" said the hypnotist,\r\nruminating the flavour of the jelly. \"The world did very well without us\r\nfor some thousands of years. Two hundred years ago even--not one! In\r\npractice, that is. Physicians by the thousand, of course--frightfully\r\nclumsy brutes for the most part, and following one another like\r\nsheep--but doctors of the mind, except a few empirical flounderers there\r\nwere none.\"\r\n\r\nHe concentrated his mind on the jelly.\r\n\r\n\"But were people so sane--?\" began Mwres.\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist shook his head. \"It didn't matter then if they were a bit\r\nsilly or faddy. Life was so easy-going then. No competition worth\r\nspeaking of--no pressure. A human being had to be very lopsided before\r\nanything happened. Then, you know, they clapped 'em away in what they\r\ncalled a lunatic asylum.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Mwres. \"In these confounded historical romances that\r\nevery one is listening to, they always rescue a beautiful girl from an\r\nasylum or something of the sort. I don't know if you attend to that\r\nrubbish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must confess I do,\" said the hypnotist. \"It carries one out of\r\noneself to hear of those quaint, adventurous, half-civilised days of the\r\nnineteenth century, when men were stout and women simple. I like a good\r\nswaggering story before all things. Curious times they were, with their\r\nsmutty railways and puffing old iron trains, their rum little houses and\r\ntheir horse vehicles. I suppose you don't read books?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear, no!\" said Mwres, \"I went to a modern school and we had none of\r\nthat old-fashioned nonsense. Phonographs are good enough for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the hypnotist, \"of course\"; and surveyed the table for\r\nhis next choice. \"You know,\" he said, helping himself to a dark blue\r\nconfection that promised well, \"in those days our business was scarcely\r\nthought of. I daresay if any one had told them that in two hundred\r\nyears' time a class of men would be entirely occupied in impressing\r\nthings upon the memory, effacing unpleasant ideas, controlling and\r\novercoming instinctive but undesirable impulses, and so forth, by means\r\nof hypnotism, they would have refused to believe the thing possible. Few\r\npeople knew that an order made during a mesmeric trance, even an order\r\nto forget or an order to desire, could be given so as to be obeyed after\r\nthe trance was over. Yet there were men alive then who could have told\r\nthem the thing was as absolutely certain to come about as--well, the\r\ntransit of Venus.\"\r\n\r\n\"They knew of hypnotism, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, yes! They used it--for painless dentistry and things like\r\nthat! This blue stuff is confoundedly good: what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't the faintest idea,\" said Mwres, \"but I admit it's very good.\r\nTake some more.\"\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist repeated his praises, and there was an appreciative pause.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of these historical romances,\" said Mwres, with an attempt at\r\nan easy, off-hand manner, \"brings me--ah--to the matter I--ah--had in\r\nmind when I asked you--when I expressed a wish to see you.\" He paused\r\nand took a deep breath.\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist turned an attentive eye upon him, and continued eating.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" said Mwres, \"I have a--in fact a--daughter. Well, you\r\nknow I have given her--ah--every educational advantage. Lectures--not a\r\nsolitary lecturer of ability in the world but she has had a telephone\r\ndirect, dancing, deportment, conversation, philosophy, art criticism ...\"\r\nHe indicated catholic culture by a gesture of his hand. \"I had intended\r\nher to marry a very good friend of mine--Bindon of the Lighting\r\nCommission--plain little man, you know, and a bit unpleasant in some of\r\nhis ways, but an excellent fellow really--an excellent fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the hypnotist, \"go on. How old is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dangerous age. Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well: it seems that she has been indulging in these historical\r\nromances--excessively. Excessively. Even to the neglect of her\r\nphilosophy. Filled her mind with unutterable nonsense about soldiers who\r\nfight--what is it?--Etruscans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Egyptians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Egyptians--very probably. Hack about with swords and revolvers and\r\nthings--bloodshed galore--horrible!--and about young men on torpedo\r\ncatchers who blow up--Spaniards, I fancy--and all sorts of irregular\r\nadventurers. And she has got it into her head that she must marry for\r\nLove, and that poor little Bindon--\"\r\n\r\n\"I've met similar cases,\" said the hypnotist. \"Who is the other young\r\nman?\"\r\n\r\nMwres maintained an appearance of resigned calm. \"You may well ask,\" he\r\nsaid. \"He is\"--and his voice sank with shame--\"a mere attendant upon the\r\nstage on which the flying-machines from Paris alight. He has--as they\r\nsay in the romances--good looks. He is quite young and very eccentric.\r\nAffects the antique--he can read and write! So can she. And instead of\r\ncommunicating by telephone, like sensible people, they write and\r\ndeliver--what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Notes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not notes.... Ah--poems.\"\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist raised his eyebrows. \"How did she meet him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tripped coming down from the flying-machine from Paris--and fell into\r\nhis arms. The mischief was done in a moment!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--that's all. Things must be stopped. That is what I want to\r\nconsult you about. What must be done? What _can_ be done? Of course I'm\r\nnot a hypnotist; my knowledge is limited. But you--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hypnotism is not magic,\" said the man in green, putting both arms on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, precisely! But still--!\"\r\n\r\n\"People cannot be hypnotised without their consent. If she is able to\r\nstand out against marrying Bindon, she will probably stand out against\r\nbeing hypnotised. But if once she can be hypnotised--even by somebody\r\nelse--the thing is done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly! Once we get her amenable, then we can suggest that she\r\n_must_ marry Bindon--that that is her fate; or that the young man is\r\nrepulsive, and that when she sees him she will be giddy and faint, or\r\nany little thing of that sort. Or if we can get her into a sufficiently\r\nprofound trance we can suggest that she should forget him altogether--\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the problem is to get her hypnotised. Of course no sort of proposal\r\nor suggestion must come from you--because no doubt she already distrusts\r\nyou in the matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist leant his head upon his arm and thought.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard a man cannot dispose of his own daughter,\" said Mwres\r\nirrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\"You must give me the name and address of the young lady,\" said the\r\nhypnotist, \"and any information bearing upon the matter. And, by the\r\nbye, is there any money in the affair?\"\r\n\r\nMwres hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"There's a sum--in fact, a considerable sum--invested in the Patent Road\r\nCompany. From her mother. That's what makes the thing so exasperating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said the hypnotist. And he proceeded to cross-examine Mwres\r\non the entire affair.\r\n\r\nIt was a lengthy interview.\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile \"Elizebeθ Mwres,\" as she spelt her name, or \"Elizabeth\r\nMorris\" as a nineteenth-century person would have put it, was sitting in\r\na quiet waiting-place beneath the great stage upon which the\r\nflying-machine from Paris descended. And beside her sat her slender,\r\nhandsome lover reading her the poem he had written that morning while on\r\nduty upon the stage. When he had finished they sat for a time in\r\nsilence; and then, as if for their special entertainment, the great\r\nmachine that had come flying through the air from America that morning\r\nrushed down out of the sky.\r\n\r\nAt first it was a little oblong, faint and blue amidst the distant\r\nfleecy clouds; and then it grew swiftly large and white, and larger and\r\nwhiter, until they could see the separate tiers of sails, each hundreds\r\nof feet wide, and the lank body they supported, and at last even the\r\nswinging seats of the passengers in a dotted row. Although it was\r\nfalling it seemed to them to be rushing up the sky, and over the\r\nroof-spaces of the city below its shadow leapt towards them. They heard\r\nthe whistling rush of the air about it and its yelling siren, shrill and\r\nswelling, to warn those who were on its landing-stage of its arrival.\r\nAnd abruptly the note fell down a couple of octaves, and it had passed,\r\nand the sky was clear and void, and she could turn her sweet eyes again\r\nto Denton at her side.\r\n\r\nTheir silence ended; and Denton, speaking in a little language of broken\r\nEnglish that was, they fancied, their private possession--though lovers\r\nhave used such little languages since the world began--told her how they\r\ntoo would leap into the air one morning out of all the obstacles and\r\ndifficulties about them, and fly to a sunlit city of delight he knew of\r\nin Japan, half-way about the world.\r\n\r\nShe loved the dream, but she feared the leap; and she put him off with\r\n\"Some day, dearest one, some day,\" to all his pleading that it might be\r\nsoon; and at last came a shrilling of whistles, and it was time for him\r\nto go back to his duties on the stage. They parted--as lovers have been\r\nwont to part for thousands of years. She walked down a passage to a\r\nlift, and so came to one of the streets of that latter-day London, all\r\nglazed in with glass from the weather, and with incessant moving\r\nplatforms that went to all parts of the city. And by one of these she\r\nreturned to her apartments in the Hotel for Women where she lived, the\r\napartments that were in telephonic communication with all the best\r\nlecturers in the world. But the sunlight of the flying stage was in her\r\nheart, and the wisdom of all the best lecturers in the world seemed\r\nfolly in that light.\r\n\r\nShe spent the middle part of the day in the gymnasium, and took her\r\nmidday meal with two other girls and their common chaperone--for it was\r\nstill the custom to have a chaperone in the case of motherless girls of\r\nthe more prosperous classes. The chaperone had a visitor that day, a man\r\nin green and yellow, with a white face and vivid eyes, who talked\r\namazingly. Among other things, he fell to praising a new historical\r\nromance that one of the great popular story-tellers of the day had just\r\nput forth. It was, of course, about the spacious times of Queen\r\nVictoria; and the author, among other pleasing novelties, made a little\r\nargument before each section of the story, in imitation of the chapter\r\nheadings of the old-fashioned books: as for example, \"How the Cabmen of\r\nPimlico stopped the Victoria Omnibuses, and of the Great Fight in Palace\r\nYard,\" and \"How the Piccadilly Policeman was slain in the midst of his\r\nDuty.\" The man in green and yellow praised this innovation. \"These pithy\r\nsentences,\" he said, \"are admirable. They show at a glance those\r\nheadlong, tumultuous times, when men and animals jostled in the filthy\r\nstreets, and death might wait for one at every corner. Life was life\r\nthen! How great the world must have seemed then! How marvellous! They\r\nwere still parts of the world absolutely unexplored. Nowadays we have\r\nalmost abolished wonder, we lead lives so trim and orderly that courage,\r\nendurance, faith, all the noble virtues seem fading from mankind.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on, taking the girls' thoughts with him, until the life they led,\r\nlife in the vast and intricate London of the twenty-second century, a\r\nlife interspersed with soaring excursions to every part of the globe,\r\nseemed to them a monotonous misery compared with the dædal past.\r\n\r\nAt first Elizabeth did not join in the conversation, but after a time\r\nthe subject became so interesting that she made a few shy\r\ninterpolations. But he scarcely seemed to notice her as he talked. He\r\nwent on to describe a new method of entertaining people. They were\r\nhypnotised, and then suggestions were made to them so skilfully that\r\nthey seemed to be living in ancient times again. They played out a\r\nlittle romance in the past as vivid as reality, and when at last they\r\nawakened they remembered all they had been through as though it were a\r\nreal thing.\r\n\r\n\"It is a thing we have sought to do for years and years,\" said the\r\nhypnotist. \"It is practically an artificial dream. And we know the way\r\nat last. Think of all it opens out to us--the enrichment of our\r\nexperience, the recovery of adventure, the refuge it offers from this\r\nsordid, competitive life in which we live! Think!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can do that!\" said the chaperone eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"The thing is possible at last,\" the hypnotist said. \"You may order a\r\ndream as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nThe chaperone was the first to be hypnotised, and the dream, she said,\r\nwas wonderful, when she came to again.\r\n\r\nThe other two girls, encouraged by her enthusiasm, also placed\r\nthemselves in the hands of the hypnotist and had plunges into the\r\nromantic past. No one suggested that Elizabeth should try this novel\r\nentertainment; it was at her own request at last that she was taken into\r\nthat land of dreams where there is neither any freedom of choice nor\r\nwill....\r\n\r\nAnd so the mischief was done.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Denton went down to that quiet seat beneath the flying\r\nstage, Elizabeth was not in her wonted place. He was disappointed, and a\r\nlittle angry. The next day she did not come, and the next also. He was\r\nafraid. To hide his fear from himself, he set to work to write sonnets\r\nfor her when she should come again....\r\n\r\nFor three days he fought against his dread by such distraction, and then\r\nthe truth was before him clear and cold, and would not be denied. She\r\nmight be ill, she might be dead; but he would not believe that he had\r\nbeen betrayed. There followed a week of misery. And then he knew she was\r\nthe only thing on earth worth having, and that he must seek her, however\r\nhopeless the search, until she was found once more.\r\n\r\nHe had some small private means of his own, and so he threw over his\r\nappointment on the flying stage, and set himself to find this girl who\r\nhad become at last all the world to him. He did not know where she\r\nlived, and little of her circumstances; for it had been part of the\r\ndelight of her girlish romance that he should know nothing of her,\r\nnothing of the difference of their station. The ways of the city opened\r\nbefore him east and west, north and south. Even in Victorian days London\r\nwas a maze, that little London with its poor four millions of people;\r\nbut the London he explored, the London of the twenty-second century, was\r\na London of thirty million souls. At first he was energetic and\r\nheadlong, taking time neither to eat nor sleep. He sought for weeks and\r\nmonths, he went through every imaginable phase of fatigue and despair,\r\nover-excitement and anger. Long after hope was dead, by the sheer\r\ninertia of his desire he still went to and fro, peering into faces and\r\nlooking this way and that, in the incessant ways and lifts and passages\r\nof that interminable hive of men.\r\n\r\nAt last chance was kind to him, and he saw her.\r\n\r\nIt was in a time of festivity. He was hungry; he had paid the inclusive\r\nfee and had gone into one of the gigantic dining-places of the city; he\r\nwas pushing his way among the tables and scrutinising by mere force of\r\nhabit every group he passed.\r\n\r\nHe stood still, robbed of all power of motion, his eyes wide, his lips\r\napart. Elizabeth sat scarcely twenty yards away from him, looking\r\nstraight at him. Her eyes were as hard to him, as hard and\r\nexpressionless and void of recognition, as the eyes of a statue.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a moment, and then her gaze passed beyond him.\r\n\r\nHad he had only her eyes to judge by he might have doubted if it was\r\nindeed Elizabeth, but he knew her by the gesture of her hand, by the\r\ngrace of a wanton little curl that floated over her ear as she moved her\r\nhead. Something was said to her, and she turned smiling tolerantly to\r\nthe man beside her, a little man in foolish raiment knobbed and spiked\r\nlike some odd reptile with pneumatic horns--the Bindon of her father's\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Denton stood white and wild-eyed; then came a terrible\r\nfaintness, and he sat before one of the little tables. He sat down with\r\nhis back to her, and for a time he did not dare to look at her again.\r\nWhen at last he did, she and Bindon and two other people were standing\r\nup to go. The others were her father and her chaperone.\r\n\r\nHe sat as if incapable of action until the four figures were remote and\r\nsmall, and then he rose up possessed with the one idea of pursuit. For\r\na space he feared he had lost them, and then he came upon Elizabeth and\r\nher chaperone again in one of the streets of moving platforms that\r\nintersected the city. Bindon and Mwres had disappeared.\r\n\r\nHe could not control himself to patience. He felt he must speak to her\r\nforthwith, or die. He pushed forward to where they were seated, and sat\r\ndown beside them. His white face was convulsed with half-hysterical\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on her wrist. \"Elizabeth?\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe turned in unfeigned astonishment. Nothing but the fear of a strange\r\nman showed in her face.\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth,\" he cried, and his voice was strange to him: \"dearest--you\r\n_know_ me?\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth's face showed nothing but alarm and perplexity. She drew\r\nherself away from him. The chaperone, a little grey-headed woman with\r\nmobile features, leant forward to intervene. Her resolute bright eyes\r\nexamined Denton. \"_What_ do you say?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"This young lady,\" said Denton,--\"she knows me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know him, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Elizabeth in a strange voice, and with a hand to her\r\nforehead, speaking almost as one who repeats a lesson. \"No, I do not\r\nknow him. I _know_--I do not know him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but ... Not know me! It is I--Denton. Denton! To whom you used to\r\ntalk. Don't you remember the flying stages? The little seat in the open\r\nair? The verses--\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" cried Elizabeth,--\"no. I do not know him. I do not know him. There\r\nis something.... But I don't know. All I know is that I do not know\r\nhim.\" Her face was a face of infinite distress.\r\n\r\nThe sharp eyes of the chaperone flitted to and fro from the girl to the\r\nman. \"You see?\" she said, with the faint shadow of a smile. \"She does\r\nnot know you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know you,\" said Elizabeth. \"Of that I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, dear--the songs--the little verses--\"\r\n\r\n\"She does not know you,\" said the chaperone. \"You must not.... You have\r\nmade a mistake. You must not go on talking to us after that. You must\r\nnot annoy us on the public ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" said Denton, and for a moment his miserably haggard face\r\nappealed against fate.\r\n\r\n\"You must not persist, young man,\" protested the chaperone.\r\n\r\n\"_Elizabeth!_\" he cried.\r\n\r\nHer face was the face of one who is tormented. \"I do not know you,\" she\r\ncried, hand to brow. \"Oh, I do not know you!\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant Denton sat stunned. Then he stood up and groaned aloud.\r\n\r\nHe made a strange gesture of appeal towards the remote glass roof of the\r\npublic way, then turned and went plunging recklessly from one moving\r\nplatform to another, and vanished amidst the swarms of people going to\r\nand fro thereon. The chaperone's eyes followed him, and then she looked\r\nat the curious faces about her.\r\n\r\n\"Dear,\" asked Elizabeth, clasping her hand, and too deeply moved to heed\r\nobservation, \"who was that man? Who _was_ that man?\"\r\n\r\nThe chaperone raised her eyebrows. She spoke in a clear, audible voice.\r\n\"Some half-witted creature. I have never set eyes on him before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, dear. Do not trouble your mind about a thing like this.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd soon after this the celebrated hypnotist who dressed in green and\r\nyellow had another client. The young man paced his consulting-room, pale\r\nand disordered. \"I want to forget,\" he cried. \"I _must_ forget.\"\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist watched him with quiet eyes, studied his face and clothes\r\nand bearing. \"To forget anything--pleasure or pain--is to be, by so\r\nmuch--_less_. However, you know your own concern. My fee is high.\"\r\n\r\n\"If only I can forget--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's easy enough with you. You wish it. I've done much harder things.\r\nQuite recently. I hardly expected to do it: the thing was done against\r\nthe will of the hypnotised person. A love affair too--like yours. A\r\ngirl. So rest assured.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man came and sat beside the hypnotist. His manner was a forced\r\ncalm. He looked into the hypnotist's eyes. \"I will tell you. Of course\r\nyou will want to know what it is. There was a girl. Her name was\r\nElizabeth Mwres. Well ...\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. He had seen the instant surprise on the hypnotist's face. In\r\nthat instant he knew. He stood up. He seemed to dominate the seated\r\nfigure by his side. He gripped the shoulder of green and gold. For a\r\ntime he could not find words.\r\n\r\n\"_Give her me back!_\" he said at last. \"Give her me back!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" gasped the hypnotist.\r\n\r\n\"Give her me back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth Mwres--the girl--\"\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist tried to free himself; he rose to his feet. Denton's grip\r\ntightened.\r\n\r\n\"Let go!\" cried the hypnotist, thrusting an arm against Denton's chest.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the two men were locked in a clumsy wrestle. Neither had the\r\nslightest training--for athleticism, except for exhibition and to afford\r\nopportunity for betting, had faded out of the earth--but Denton was not\r\nonly the younger but the stronger of the two. They swayed across the\r\nroom, and then the hypnotist had gone down under his antagonist. They\r\nfell together....\r\n\r\nDenton leaped to his feet, dismayed at his own fury; but the hypnotist\r\nlay still, and suddenly from a little white mark where his forehead had\r\nstruck a stool shot a hurrying band of red. For a space Denton stood\r\nover him irresolute, trembling.\r\n\r\nA fear of the consequences entered his gently nurtured mind. He turned\r\ntowards the door. \"No,\" he said aloud, and came back to the middle of\r\nthe room. Overcoming the instinctive repugnance of one who had seen no\r\nact of violence in all his life before, he knelt down beside his\r\nantagonist and felt his heart. Then he peered at the wound. He rose\r\nquietly and looked about him. He began to see more of the situation.\r\n\r\nWhen presently the hypnotist recovered his senses, his head ached\r\nseverely, his back was against Denton's knees and Denton was sponging\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist did not speak. But presently he indicated by a gesture\r\nthat in his opinion he had been sponged enough. \"Let me get up,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Denton.\r\n\r\n\"You have assaulted me, you scoundrel!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are alone,\" said Denton, \"and the door is secure.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of thought.\r\n\r\n\"Unless I sponge,\" said Denton, \"your forehead will develop a tremendous\r\nbruise.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can go on sponging,\" said the hypnotist sulkily.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause.\r\n\r\n\"We might be in the Stone Age,\" said the hypnotist. \"Violence!\r\nStruggle!\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Stone Age no man dared to come between man and woman,\" said\r\nDenton.\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist thought again.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"While you were insensible I found the girl's address on your tablets.\r\nI did not know it before. I telephoned. She will be here soon. Then--\"\r\n\r\n\"She will bring her chaperone.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what--? I don't see. What do you mean to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I looked about for a weapon also. It is an astonishing thing how few\r\nweapons there are nowadays. If you consider that in the Stone Age men\r\nowned scarcely anything _but_ weapons. I hit at last upon this lamp. I\r\nhave wrenched off the wires and things, and I hold it so.\" He extended\r\nit over the hypnotist's shoulders. \"With that I can quite easily smash\r\nyour skull. I _will_--unless you do as I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Violence is no remedy,\" said the hypnotist, quoting from the \"Modern\r\nMan's Book of Moral Maxims.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's an undesirable disease,\" said Denton.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will tell that chaperone you are going to order the girl to marry\r\nthat knobby little brute with the red hair and ferrety eyes. I believe\r\nthat's how things stand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--that's how things stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, pretending to do that, you will restore her memory of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's unprofessional.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here! If I cannot have that girl I would rather die than not. I\r\ndon't propose to respect your little fancies. If anything goes wrong you\r\nshall not live five minutes. This is a rude makeshift of a weapon, and\r\nit may quite conceivably be painful to kill you. But I will. It is\r\nunusual, I know, nowadays to do things like this--mainly because there\r\nis so little in life that is worth being violent about.\"\r\n\r\n\"The chaperone will see you directly she comes--\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall stand in that recess. Behind you.\"\r\n\r\nThe hypnotist thought. \"You are a determined young man,\" he said, \"and\r\nonly half civilised. I have tried to do my duty to my client, but in\r\nthis affair you seem likely to get your own way....\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to deal straightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to risk having my brains scattered in a petty affair like\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"And afterwards?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing a hypnotist or doctor hates so much as a scandal. I at\r\nleast am no savage. I am annoyed.... But in a day or so I shall bear no\r\nmalice....\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. And now that we understand each other, there is no\r\nnecessity to keep you sitting any longer on the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII--THE VACANT COUNTRY\r\n\r\nThe world, they say, changed more between the year 1800 and the year\r\n1900 than it had done in the previous five hundred years. That century,\r\nthe nineteenth century, was the dawn of a new epoch in the history of\r\nmankind--the epoch of the great cities, the end of the old order of\r\ncountry life.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the nineteenth century the majority of mankind still\r\nlived upon the countryside, as their way of life had been for countless\r\ngenerations. All over the world they dwelt in little towns and villages\r\nthen, and engaged either directly in agriculture, or in occupations that\r\nwere of service to the agriculturist. They travelled rarely, and dwelt\r\nclose to their work, because swift means of transit had not yet come.\r\nThe few who travelled went either on foot, or in slow sailing-ships, or\r\nby means of jogging horses incapable of more than sixty miles a day.\r\nThink of it!--sixty miles a day. Here and there, in those sluggish\r\ntimes, a town grew a little larger than its neighbours, as a port or as\r\na centre of government; but all the towns in the world with more than a\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants could be counted on a man's fingers. So it\r\nwas in the beginning of the nineteenth century. By the end, the\r\ninvention of railways, telegraphs, steamships, and complex agricultural\r\nmachinery, had changed all these things: changed them beyond all hope of\r\nreturn. The vast shops, the varied pleasures, the countless conveniences\r\nof the larger towns were suddenly possible, and no sooner existed than\r\nthey were brought into competition with the homely resources of the\r\nrural centres. Mankind were drawn to the cities by an overwhelming\r\nattraction. The demand for labour fell with the increase of machinery,\r\nthe local markets were entirely superseded, and there was a rapid growth\r\nof the larger centres at the expense of the open country.\r\n\r\nThe flow of population townward was the constant preoccupation of\r\nVictorian writers. In Great Britain and New England, in India and China,\r\nthe same thing was remarked: everywhere a few swollen towns were visibly\r\nreplacing the ancient order. That this was an inevitable result of\r\nimproved means of travel and transport--that, given swift means of\r\ntransit, these things must be--was realised by few; and the most puerile\r\nschemes were devised to overcome the mysterious magnetism of the urban\r\ncentres, and keep the people on the land.\r\n\r\nYet the developments of the nineteenth century were only the dawning of\r\nthe new order. The first great cities of the new time were horribly\r\ninconvenient, darkened by smoky fogs, insanitary and noisy; but the\r\ndiscovery of new methods of building, new methods of heating, changed\r\nall this. Between 1900 and 2000 the march of change was still more\r\nrapid; and between 2000 and 2100 the continually accelerated progress of\r\nhuman invention made the reign of Victoria the Good seem at last an\r\nalmost incredible vision of idyllic tranquil days.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of railways was only the first step in that development\r\nof those means of locomotion which finally revolutionised human life. By\r\nthe year 2000 railways and roads had vanished together. The railways,\r\nrobbed of their rails, had become weedy ridges and ditches upon the face\r\nof the world; the old roads, strange barbaric tracks of flint and soil,\r\nhammered by hand or rolled by rough iron rollers, strewn with\r\nmiscellaneous filth, and cut by iron hoofs and wheels into ruts and\r\npuddles often many inches deep, had been replaced by patent tracks made\r\nof a substance called Eadhamite. This Eadhamite--it was named after its\r\npatentee--ranks with the invention of printing and steam as one of the\r\nepoch-making discoveries of the world's history.\r\n\r\nWhen Eadham discovered the substance, he probably thought of it as a\r\nmere cheap substitute for india rubber; it cost a few shillings a ton.\r\nBut you can never tell all an invention will do. It was the genius of a\r\nman named Warming that pointed to the possibility of using it, not only\r\nfor the tires of wheels, but as a road substance, and who organised the\r\nenormous network of public ways that speedily covered the world.\r\n\r\nThese public ways were made with longitudinal divisions. On the outer on\r\neither side went foot cyclists and conveyances travelling at a less\r\nspeed than twenty-five miles an hour; in the middle, motors capable of\r\nspeed up to a hundred; and the inner, Warming (in the face of enormous\r\nridicule) reserved for vehicles travelling at speeds of a hundred miles\r\nan hour and upward.\r\n\r\nFor ten years his inner ways were vacant. Before he died they were the\r\nmost crowded of all, and vast light frameworks with wheels of twenty and\r\nthirty feet in diameter, hurled along them at paces that year after year\r\nrose steadily towards two hundred miles an hour. And by the time this\r\nrevolution was accomplished, a parallel revolution had transformed the\r\never-growing cities. Before the development of practical science the\r\nfogs and filth of Victorian times vanished. Electric heating replaced\r\nfires (in 2013 the lighting of a fire that did not absolutely consume\r\nits own smoke was made an indictable nuisance), and all the city ways,\r\nall public squares and places, were covered in with a recently invented\r\nglass-like substance. The roofing of London became practically\r\ncontinuous. Certain short-sighted and foolish legislation against tall\r\nbuildings was abolished, and London, from a squat expanse of petty\r\nhouses--feebly archaic in design--rose steadily towards the sky. To the\r\nmunicipal responsibility for water, light, and drainage, was added\r\nanother, and that was ventilation.\r\n\r\nBut to tell of all the changes in human convenience that these two\r\nhundred years brought about, to tell of the long foreseen invention of\r\nflying, to describe how life in households was steadily supplanted by\r\nlife in interminable hotels, how at last even those who were still\r\nconcerned in agricultural work came to live in the towns and to go to\r\nand fro to their work every day, to describe how at last in all England\r\nonly four towns remained, each with many millions of people, and how\r\nthere were left no inhabited houses in all the countryside: to tell all\r\nthis would take us far from our story of Denton and his Elizabeth. They\r\nhad been separated and reunited, and still they could not marry. For\r\nDenton--it was his only fault--had no money. Neither had Elizabeth until\r\nshe was twenty-one, and as yet she was only eighteen. At twenty-one all\r\nthe property of her mother would come to her, for that was the custom of\r\nthe time. She did not know that it was possible to anticipate her\r\nfortune, and Denton was far too delicate a lover to suggest such a\r\nthing. So things stuck hopelessly between them. Elizabeth said that she\r\nwas very unhappy, and that nobody understood her but Denton, and that\r\nwhen she was away from him she was wretched; and Denton said that his\r\nheart longed for her day and night. And they met as often as they could\r\nto enjoy the discussion of their sorrows.\r\n\r\nThey met one day at their little seat upon the flying stage. The precise\r\nsite of this meeting was where in Victorian times the road from\r\nWimbledon came out upon the common. They were, however, five hundred\r\nfeet above that point. Their seat looked far over London. To convey the\r\nappearance of it all to a nineteenth-century reader would have been\r\ndifficult. One would have had to tell him to think of the Crystal\r\nPalace, of the newly built \"mammoth\" hotels--as those little affairs\r\nwere called--of the larger railway stations of his time, and to imagine\r\nsuch buildings enlarged to vast proportions and run together and\r\ncontinuous over the whole metropolitan area. If then he was told that\r\nthis continuous roof-space bore a huge forest of rotating wind-wheels,\r\nhe would have begun very dimly to appreciate what to these young people\r\nwas the commonest sight in their lives.\r\n\r\nTo their eyes it had something of the quality of a prison, and they were\r\ntalking, as they had talked a hundred times before, of how they might\r\nescape from it and be at last happy together: escape from it, that is,\r\nbefore the appointed three years were at an end. It was, they both\r\nagreed, not only impossible but almost wicked, to wait three years.\r\n\"Before that,\" said Denton--and the notes of his voice told of a\r\nsplendid chest--\"_we might both be dead_!\"\r\n\r\nTheir vigorous young hands had to grip at this, and then Elizabeth had a\r\nstill more poignant thought that brought the tears from her wholesome\r\neyes and down her healthy cheeks. \"_One_ of us,\" she said, \"_one_ of us\r\nmight be--\"\r\n\r\nShe choked; she could not say the word that is so terrible to the young\r\nand happy.\r\n\r\nYet to marry and be very poor in the cities of that time was--for any\r\none who had lived pleasantly--a very dreadful thing. In the old\r\nagricultural days that had drawn to an end in the eighteenth century\r\nthere had been a pretty proverb of love in a cottage; and indeed in\r\nthose days the poor of the countryside had dwelt in flower-covered,\r\ndiamond-windowed cottages of thatch and plaster, with the sweet air and\r\nearth about them, amidst tangled hedges and the song of birds, and with\r\nthe ever-changing sky overhead. But all this had changed (the change was\r\nalready beginning in the nineteenth century), and a new sort of life was\r\nopening for the poor--in the lower quarters of the city.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth century the lower quarters were still beneath the sky;\r\nthey were areas of land on clay or other unsuitable soil, liable to\r\nfloods or exposed to the smoke of more fortunate districts,\r\ninsufficiently supplied with water, and as insanitary as the great fear\r\nof infectious diseases felt by the wealthier classes permitted. In the\r\ntwenty-second century, however, the growth of the city storey above\r\nstorey, and the coalescence of buildings, had led to a different\r\narrangement. The prosperous people lived in a vast series of sumptuous\r\nhotels in the upper storeys and halls of the city fabric; the industrial\r\npopulation dwelt beneath in the tremendous ground-floor and basement, so\r\nto speak, of the place.\r\n\r\nIn the refinement of life and manners these lower classes differed\r\nlittle from their ancestors, the East-enders of Queen Victoria's time;\r\nbut they had developed a distinct dialect of their own. In these under\r\nways they lived and died, rarely ascending to the surface except when\r\nwork took them there. Since for most of them this was the sort of life\r\nto which they had been born, they found no great misery in such\r\ncircumstances; but for people like Denton and Elizabeth, such a plunge\r\nwould have seemed more terrible than death.\r\n\r\n\"And yet what else is there?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nDenton professed not to know. Apart from his own feeling of delicacy, he\r\nwas not sure how Elizabeth would like the idea of borrowing on the\r\nstrength of her expectations.\r\n\r\nThe passage from London to Paris even, said Elizabeth, was beyond their\r\nmeans; and in Paris, as in any other city in the world, life would be\r\njust as costly and impossible as in London.\r\n\r\nWell might Denton cry aloud: \"If only we had lived in those days,\r\ndearest! If only we had lived in the past!\" For to their eyes even\r\nnineteenth-century Whitechapel was seen through a mist of romance.\r\n\r\n\"Is there _nothing_?\" cried Elizabeth, suddenly weeping. \"Must we really\r\nwait for those three long years? Fancy _three_ years--six-and-thirty\r\nmonths!\" The human capacity for patience had not grown with the ages.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Denton was moved to speak of something that had already\r\nflickered across his mind. He had hit upon it at last. It seemed to him\r\nso wild a suggestion that he made it only half seriously. But to put a\r\nthing into words has ever a way of making it seem more real and possible\r\nthan it seemed before. And so it was with him.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" he said, \"we went into the country?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him to see if he was serious in proposing such an\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\"The country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--beyond there. Beyond the hills.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could we live?\" she said. \"_Where_ could we live?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not impossible,\" he said. \"People used to live in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then there were houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are the ruins of villages and towns now. On the clay lands they\r\nare gone, of course. But they are still left on the grazing land,\r\nbecause it does not pay the Food Company to remove them. I know\r\nthat--for certain. Besides, one sees them from the flying machines, you\r\nknow. Well, we might shelter in some one of these, and repair it with\r\nour hands. Do you know, the thing is not so wild as it seems. Some of\r\nthe men who go out every day to look after the crops and herds might be\r\npaid to bring us food....\"\r\n\r\nShe stood in front of him. \"How strange it would be if one really\r\ncould....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"But no one dares.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is no reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be--oh! it would be so romantic and strange. If only it were\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are so many things. Think of all the things we have, things that\r\nwe should miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should we miss them? After all, the life we lead is very unreal--very\r\nartificial.\" He began to expand his idea, and as he warmed to his\r\nexposition the fantastic quality of his first proposal faded away.\r\n\r\nShe thought. \"But I have heard of prowlers--escaped criminals.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. He hesitated over his answer because he thought it sounded\r\nboyish. He blushed. \"I could get some one I know to make me a sword.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with enthusiasm growing in her eyes. She had heard of\r\nswords, had seen one in a museum; she thought of those ancient days when\r\nmen wore them as a common thing. His suggestion seemed an impossible\r\ndream to her, and perhaps for that reason she was eager for more detail.\r\nAnd inventing for the most part as he went along, he told her, how they\r\nmight live in the country as the old-world people had done. With every\r\ndetail her interest grew, for she was one of those girls for whom\r\nromance and adventure have a fascination.\r\n\r\nHis suggestion seemed, I say, an impossible dream to her on that day,\r\nbut the next day they talked about it again, and it was strangely less\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\"At first we should take food,\" said Denton. \"We could carry food for\r\nten or twelve days.\" It was an age of compact artificial nourishment,\r\nand such a provision had none of the unwieldy suggestion it would have\r\nhad in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\"But--until our house,\" she asked--\"until it was ready, where should we\r\nsleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"But ... What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a time when there were no houses in the world; when all\r\nmankind slept always in the open air.\"\r\n\r\n\"But for us! The emptiness! No walls--no ceiling!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear,\" he said, \"in London you have many beautiful ceilings. Artists\r\npaint them and stud them with lights. But I have seen a ceiling more\r\nbeautiful than any in London....\"\r\n\r\n\"But where?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the ceiling under which we two would be alone....\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear,\" he said, \"it is something the world has forgotten. It is Heaven\r\nand all the host of stars.\"\r\n\r\nEach time they talked the thing seemed more possible and more desirable\r\nto them. In a week or so it was quite possible. Another week, and it was\r\nthe inevitable thing they had to do. A great enthusiasm for the country\r\nseized hold of them and possessed them. The sordid tumult of the town,\r\nthey said, overwhelmed them. They marvelled that this simple way out of\r\ntheir troubles had never come upon them before.\r\n\r\nOne morning near Midsummer-day, there was a new minor official upon the\r\nflying stage, and Denton's place was to know him no more.\r\n\r\nOur two young people had secretly married, and were going forth manfully\r\nout of the city in which they and their ancestors before them had lived\r\nall their days. She wore a new dress of white cut in an old-fashioned\r\npattern, and he had a bundle of provisions strapped athwart his back,\r\nand in his hand he carried--rather shame-facedly it is true, and under\r\nhis purple cloak--an implement of archaic form, a cross-hilted thing of\r\ntempered steel.\r\n\r\nImagine that going forth! In their days the sprawling suburbs of\r\nVictorian times with their vile roads, petty houses, foolish little\r\ngardens of shrub and geranium, and all their futile, pretentious\r\nprivacies, had disappeared: the towering buildings of the new age, the\r\nmechanical ways, the electric and water mains, all came to an end\r\ntogether, like a wall, like a cliff, near four hundred feet in height,\r\nabrupt and sheer. All about the city spread the carrot, swede, and\r\nturnip fields of the Food Company, vegetables that were the basis of a\r\nthousand varied foods, and weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly\r\nextirpated. The incessant expense of weeding that went on year after\r\nyear in the petty, wasteful and barbaric farming of the ancient days,\r\nthe Food Company had economised for ever more by a campaign of\r\nextermination. Here and there, however, neat rows of bramble standards\r\nand apple trees with whitewashed stems, intersected the fields, and at\r\nplaces groups of gigantic teazles reared their favoured spikes. Here and\r\nthere huge agricultural machines hunched under waterproof covers. The\r\nmingled waters of the Wey and Mole and Wandle ran in rectangular\r\nchannels; and wherever a gentle elevation of the ground permitted a\r\nfountain of deodorised sewage distributed its benefits athwart the land\r\nand made a rainbow of the sunlight.\r\n\r\nBy a great archway in that enormous city wall emerged the Eadhamite road\r\nto Portsmouth, swarming in the morning sunshine with an enormous traffic\r\nbearing the blue-clad servants of the Food Company to their toil. A\r\nrushing traffic, beside which they seemed two scarce-moving dots. Along\r\nthe outer tracks hummed and rattled the tardy little old-fashioned\r\nmotors of such as had duties within twenty miles or so of the city; the\r\ninner ways were filled with vaster mechanisms--swift monocycles bearing\r\na score of men, lank multicycles, quadricycles sagging with heavy loads,\r\nempty gigantic produce carts that would come back again filled before\r\nthe sun was setting, all with throbbing engines and noiseless wheels and\r\na perpetual wild melody of horns and gongs.\r\n\r\nAlong the very verge of the outermost way our young people went in\r\nsilence, newly wed and oddly shy of one another's company. Many were the\r\nthings shouted to them as they tramped along, for in 2100 a\r\nfoot-passenger on an English road was almost as strange a sight as a\r\nmotor car would have been in 1800. But they went on with steadfast eyes\r\ninto the country, paying no heed to such cries.\r\n\r\nBefore them in the south rose the Downs, blue at first, and as they came\r\nnearer changing to green, surmounted by the row of gigantic wind-wheels\r\nthat supplemented the wind-wheels upon the roof-spaces of the city, and\r\nbroken and restless with the long morning shadows of those whirling\r\nvanes. By midday they had come so near that they could see here and\r\nthere little patches of pallid dots--the sheep the Meat Department of\r\nthe Food Company owned. In another hour they had passed the clay and the\r\nroot crops and the single fence that hedged them in, and the prohibition\r\nagainst trespass no longer held: the levelled roadway plunged into a\r\ncutting with all its traffic, and they could leave it and walk over the\r\ngreensward and up the open hillside.\r\n\r\nNever had these children of the latter days been together in such a\r\nlonely place.\r\n\r\nThey were both very hungry and footsore--for walking was a rare\r\nexercise--and presently they sat down on the weedless, close-cropped\r\ngrass, and looked back for the first time at the city from which they\r\nhad come, shining wide and splendid in the blue haze of the valley of\r\nthe Thames. Elizabeth was a little afraid of the unenclosed sheep away\r\nup the slope--she had never been near big unrestrained animals\r\nbefore--but Denton reassured her. And overhead a white-winged bird\r\ncircled in the blue.\r\n\r\nThey talked but little until they had eaten, and then their tongues were\r\nloosened. He spoke of the happiness that was now certainly theirs, of\r\nthe folly of not breaking sooner out of that magnificent prison of\r\nlatter-day life, of the old romantic days that had passed from the\r\nworld for ever. And then he became boastful. He took up the sword that\r\nlay on the ground beside him, and she took it from his hand and ran a\r\ntremulous finger along the blade.\r\n\r\n\"And you could,\" she said, \"_you_--could raise this and strike a man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? If there were need.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" she said, \"it seems so horrible. It would slash.... There would\r\nbe\"--her voice sank,--\"_blood_.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the old romances you have read often enough ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know: in those--yes. But that is different. One knows it is not\r\nblood, but just a sort of red ink.... And _you_--killing!\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him doubtfully, and then handed him back the sword.\r\n\r\nAfter they had rested and eaten, they rose up and went on their way\r\ntowards the hills. They passed quite close to a huge flock of sheep, who\r\nstared and bleated at their unaccustomed figures. She had never seen\r\nsheep before, and she shivered to think such gentle things must needs be\r\nslain for food. A sheep-dog barked from a distance, and then a shepherd\r\nappeared amidst the supports of the wind-wheels, and came down towards\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen he drew near he called out asking whither they were going.\r\n\r\nDenton hesitated, and told him briefly that they sought some ruined\r\nhouse among the Downs, in which they might live together. He tried to\r\nspeak in an off-hand manner, as though it was a usual thing to do. The\r\nman stared incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Have you _done_ anything?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Denton. \"Only we don't want to live in a city any\r\nlonger. Why should we live in cities?\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd stared more incredulously than ever. \"You can't live here,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"We mean to try.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd stared from one to the other. \"You'll go back to-morrow,\"\r\nhe said. \"It looks pleasant enough in the sunlight.... Are you sure\r\nyou've done nothing? We shepherds are not such _great_ friends of the\r\npolice.\"\r\n\r\nDenton looked at him steadfastly. \"No,\" he said. \"But we are too poor to\r\nlive in the city, and we can't bear the thought of wearing clothes of\r\nblue canvas and doing drudgery. We are going to live a simple life here,\r\nlike the people of old.\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd was a bearded man with a thoughtful face. He glanced at\r\nElizabeth's fragile beauty.\r\n\r\n\"_They_ had simple minds,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"So have we,\" said Denton.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd smiled.\r\n\r\n\"If you go along here,\" he said, \"along the crest beneath the\r\nwind-wheels, you will see a heap of mounds and ruins on your right-hand\r\nside. That was once a town called Epsom. There are no houses there, and\r\nthe bricks have been used for a sheep pen. Go on, and another heap on\r\nthe edge of the root-land is Leatherhead; and then the hill turns away\r\nalong the border of a valley, and there are woods of beech. Keep along\r\nthe crest. You will come to quite wild places. In some parts, in spite\r\nof all the weeding that is done, ferns and bluebells and other such\r\nuseless plants are growing still. And through it all underneath the\r\nwind-wheels runs a straight lane paved with stones, a roadway of the\r\nRomans two thousand years old. Go to the right of that, down into the\r\nvalley and follow it along by the banks of the river. You come presently\r\nto a street of houses, many with the roofs still sound upon them. There\r\nyou may find shelter.\"\r\n\r\nThey thanked him.\r\n\r\n\"But it's a quiet place. There is no light after dark there, and I have\r\nheard tell of robbers. It is lonely. Nothing happens there. The\r\nphonographs of the story-tellers, the kinematograph entertainments, the\r\nnews machines--none of them are to be found there. If you are hungry\r\nthere is no food, if you are ill no doctor ...\" He stopped.\r\n\r\n\"We shall try it,\" said Denton, moving to go on. Then a thought struck\r\nhim, and he made an agreement with the shepherd, and learnt where they\r\nmight find him, to buy and bring them anything of which they stood in\r\nneed, out of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd in the evening they came to the deserted village, with its houses\r\nthat seemed so small and odd to them: they found it golden in the glory\r\nof the sunset, and desolate and still. They went from one deserted house\r\nto another, marvelling at their quaint simplicity, and debating which\r\nthey should choose. And at last, in a sunlit corner of a room that had\r\nlost its outer wall, they came upon a wild flower, a little flower of\r\nblue that the weeders of the Food Company had overlooked.\r\n\r\nThat house they decided upon; but they did not remain in it long that\r\nnight, because they were resolved to feast upon nature. And moreover the\r\nhouses became very gaunt and shadowy after the sunlight had faded out\r\nof the sky. So after they had rested a little time they went to the\r\ncrest of the hill again to see with their own eyes the silence of heaven\r\nset with stars, about which the old poets had had so many things to\r\ntell. It was a wonderful sight, and Denton talked like the stars, and\r\nwhen they went down the hill at last the sky was pale with dawn. They\r\nslept but little, and in the morning when they woke a thrush was singing\r\nin a tree.\r\n\r\nSo these young people of the twenty-second century began their exile.\r\nThat morning they were very busy exploring the resources of this new\r\nhome in which they were going to live the simple life. They did not\r\nexplore very fast or very far, because they went everywhere\r\nhand-in-hand; but they found the beginnings of some furniture. Beyond\r\nthe village was a store of winter fodder for the sheep of the Food\r\nCompany, and Denton dragged great armfuls to the house to make a bed;\r\nand in several of the houses were old fungus-eaten chairs and\r\ntables--rough, barbaric, clumsy furniture, it seemed to them, and made\r\nof wood. They repeated many of the things they had said on the previous\r\nday, and towards evening they found another flower, a harebell. In the\r\nlate afternoon some Company shepherds went down the river valley riding\r\non a big multicycle; but they hid from them, because their presence,\r\nElizabeth said, seemed to spoil the romance of this old-world place\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nIn this fashion they lived a week. For all that week the days were\r\ncloudless, and the nights nights of starry glory, that were invaded each\r\na little more by a crescent moon.\r\n\r\nYet something of the first splendour of their coming faded--faded\r\nimperceptibly day after day; Denton's eloquence became fitful, and\r\nlacked fresh topics of inspiration; the fatigue of their long march from\r\nLondon told in a certain stiffness of the limbs, and each suffered from\r\na slight unaccountable cold. Moreover, Denton became aware of unoccupied\r\ntime. In one place among the carelessly heaped lumber of the old times\r\nhe found a rust-eaten spade, and with this he made a fitful attack on\r\nthe razed and grass-grown garden--though he had nothing to plant or sow.\r\nHe returned to Elizabeth with a sweat-streaming face, after half an hour\r\nof such work.\r\n\r\n\"There were giants in those days,\" he said, not understanding what wont\r\nand training will do. And their walk that day led them along the hills\r\nuntil they could see the city shimmering far away in the valley. \"I\r\nwonder how things are going on there,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a change in the weather. \"Come out and see the clouds,\"\r\nshe cried; and behold! they were a sombre purple in the north and east,\r\nstreaming up to ragged edges at the zenith. And as they went up the hill\r\nthese hurrying streamers blotted out the sunset. Suddenly the wind set\r\nthe beech-trees swaying and whispering, and Elizabeth shivered. And then\r\nfar away the lightning flashed, flashed like a sword that is drawn\r\nsuddenly, and the distant thunder marched about the sky, and even as\r\nthey stood astonished, pattering upon them came the first headlong\r\nraindrops of the storm. In an instant the last streak of sunset was\r\nhidden by a falling curtain of hail, and the lightning flashed again,\r\nand the voice of the thunder roared louder, and all about them the world\r\nscowled dark and strange.\r\n\r\nSeizing hands, these children of the city ran down the hill to their\r\nhome, in infinite astonishment. And ere they reached it, Elizabeth was\r\nweeping with dismay, and the darkling ground about them was white and\r\nbrittle and active with the pelting hail.\r\n\r\nThen began a strange and terrible night for them. For the first time in\r\ntheir civilised lives they were in absolute darkness; they were wet and\r\ncold and shivering, all about them hissed the hail, and through the long\r\nneglected ceilings of the derelict home came noisy spouts of water and\r\nformed pools and rivulets on the creaking floors. As the gusts of the\r\nstorm struck the worn-out building, it groaned and shuddered, and now a\r\nmass of plaster from the wall would slide and smash, and now some\r\nloosened tile would rattle down the roof and crash into the empty\r\ngreenhouse below. Elizabeth shuddered, and was still; Denton wrapped his\r\ngay and flimsy city cloak about her, and so they crouched in the\r\ndarkness. And ever the thunder broke louder and nearer, and ever more\r\nlurid flashed the lightning, jerking into a momentary gaunt clearness\r\nthe steaming, dripping room in which they sheltered.\r\n\r\nNever before had they been in the open air save when the sun was\r\nshining. All their time had been spent in the warm and airy ways and\r\nhalls and rooms of the latter-day city. It was to them that night as if\r\nthey were in some other world, some disordered chaos of stress and\r\ntumult, and almost beyond hoping that they should ever see the city ways\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe storm seemed to last interminably, until at last they dozed between\r\nthe thunderclaps, and then very swiftly it fell and ceased. And as the\r\nlast patter of the rain died away they heard an unfamiliar sound.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" cried Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIt came again. It was the barking of dogs. It drove down the desert lane\r\nand passed; and through the window, whitening the wall before them and\r\nthrowing upon it the shadow of the window-frame and of a tree in black\r\nsilhouette, shone the light of the waxing moon....\r\n\r\nJust as the pale dawn was drawing the things about them into sight, the\r\nfitful barking of dogs came near again, and stopped. They listened.\r\nAfter a pause they heard the quick pattering of feet seeking round the\r\nhouse, and short, half-smothered barks. Then again everything was still.\r\n\r\n\"Ssh!\" whispered Elizabeth, and pointed to the door of their room.\r\n\r\nDenton went half-way towards the door, and stood listening. He came back\r\nwith a face of affected unconcern. \"They must be the sheep-dogs of the\r\nFood Company,\" he said. \"They will do us no harm.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down again beside her. \"What a night it has been!\" he said, to\r\nhide how keenly he was listening.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like dogs,\" answered Elizabeth, after a long silence.\r\n\r\n\"Dogs never hurt any one,\" said Denton. \"In the old days--in the\r\nnineteenth century--everybody had a dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a romance I heard once. A dog killed a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not this sort of dog,\" said Denton confidently. \"Some of those\r\nromances--are exaggerated.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a half bark and a pattering up the staircase; the sound of\r\npanting. Denton sprang to his feet and drew the sword out of the damp\r\nstraw upon which they had been lying. Then in the doorway appeared a\r\ngaunt sheep-dog, and halted there. Behind it stared another. For an\r\ninstant man and brute faced each other, hesitating.\r\n\r\nThen Denton, being ignorant of dogs, made a sharp step forward. \"Go\r\naway,\" he said, with a clumsy motion of his sword.\r\n\r\nThe dog started and growled. Denton stopped sharply. \"Good dog!\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe growling jerked into a bark.\r\n\r\n\"Good dog!\" said Denton. The second dog growled and barked. A third out\r\nof sight down the staircase took up the barking also. Outside others\r\ngave tongue--a large number it seemed to Denton.\r\n\r\n\"This is annoying,\" said Denton, without taking his eye off the brutes\r\nbefore him. \"Of course the shepherds won't come out of the city for\r\nhours yet. Naturally these dogs don't quite make us out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't hear,\" shouted Elizabeth. She stood up and came to him.\r\n\r\nDenton tried again, but the barking still drowned his voice. The sound\r\nhad a curious effect upon his blood. Odd disused emotions began to stir;\r\nhis face changed as he shouted. He tried again; the barking seemed to\r\nmock him, and one dog danced a pace forward, bristling. Suddenly he\r\nturned, and uttering certain words in the dialect of the underways,\r\nwords incomprehensible to Elizabeth, he made for the dogs. There was a\r\nsudden cessation of the barking, a growl and a snapping. Elizabeth saw\r\nthe snarling head of the foremost dog, its white teeth and retracted\r\nears, and the flash of the thrust blade. The brute leapt into the air\r\nand was flung back.\r\n\r\nThen Denton, with a shout, was driving the dogs before him. The sword\r\nflashed above his head with a sudden new freedom of gesture, and then he\r\nvanished down the staircase. She made six steps to follow him, and on\r\nthe landing there was blood. She stopped, and hearing the tumult of dogs\r\nand Denton's shouts pass out of the house, ran to the window.\r\n\r\nNine wolfish sheep-dogs were scattering, one writhed before the porch;\r\nand Denton, tasting that strange delight of combat that slumbers still\r\nin the blood of even the most civilised man, was shouting and running\r\nacross the garden space. And then she saw something that for a moment he\r\ndid not see. The dogs circled round this way and that, and came again.\r\nThey had him in the open.\r\n\r\nIn an instant she divined the situation. She would have called to him.\r\nFor a moment she felt sick and helpless, and then, obeying a strange\r\nimpulse, she gathered up her white skirt and ran downstairs. In the hall\r\nwas the rusting spade. That was it! She seized it and ran out.\r\n\r\nShe came none too soon. One dog rolled before him, well-nigh slashed in\r\nhalf; but a second had him by the thigh, a third gripped his collar\r\nbehind, and a fourth had the blade of the sword between its teeth,\r\ntasting its own blood. He parried the leap of a fifth with his left arm.\r\n\r\nIt might have been the first century instead of the twenty-second, so\r\nfar as she was concerned. All the gentleness of her eighteen years of\r\ncity life vanished before this primordial need. The spade smote hard and\r\nsure, and cleft a dog's skull. Another, crouching for a spring, yelped\r\nwith dismay at this unexpected antagonist, and rushed aside. Two wasted\r\nprecious moments on the binding of a feminine skirt.\r\n\r\nThe collar of Denton's cloak tore and parted as he staggered back; and\r\nthat dog too felt the spade, and ceased to trouble him. He sheathed his\r\nsword in the brute at his thigh.\r\n\r\n\"To the wall!\" cried Elizabeth; and in three seconds the fight was at an\r\nend, and our young people stood side by side, while a remnant of five\r\ndogs, with ears and tails of disaster, fled shamefully from the stricken\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they stood panting and victorious, and then Elizabeth,\r\ndropping her spade, covered her face, and sank to the ground in a\r\nparoxysm of weeping. Denton looked about him, thrust the point of his\r\nsword into the ground so that it was at hand, and stooped to comfort\r\nher.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last their more tumultuous emotions subsided, and they could talk\r\nagain. She leant upon the wall, and he sat upon it so that he could keep\r\nan eye open for any returning dogs. Two, at any rate, were up on the\r\nhillside and keeping up a vexatious barking.\r\n\r\nShe was tear-stained, but not very wretched now, because for half an\r\nhour he had been repeating that she was brave and had saved his life.\r\nBut a new fear was growing in her mind.\r\n\r\n\"They are the dogs of the Food Company,\" she said. \"There will be\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid so. Very likely they will prosecute us for trespass.\"\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n\"In the old times,\" he said, \"this sort of thing happened day after\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last night!\" she said. \"I could not live through another such night.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her. Her face was pale for want of sleep, and drawn and\r\nhaggard. He came to a sudden resolution. \"We must go back,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the dead dogs, and shivered. \"We cannot stay here,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"We must go back,\" he repeated, glancing over his shoulder to see if the\r\nenemy kept their distance. \"We have been happy for a time.... But the\r\nworld is too civilised. Ours is the age of cities. More of this will\r\nkill us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are we to do? How can we live there?\"\r\n\r\nDenton hesitated. His heel kicked against the wall on which he sat.\r\n\"It's a thing I haven't mentioned before,\" he said, and coughed;\r\n\"but ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"You could raise money on your expectations,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Could I?\" she said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you could. What a child you are!\"\r\n\r\nShe stood up, and her face was bright. \"Why did you not tell me before?\"\r\nshe asked. \"And all this time we have been here!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment, and smiled. Then the smile vanished. \"I\r\nthought it ought to come from you,\" he said. \"I didn't like to ask for\r\nyour money. And besides--at first I thought this would be rather fine.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\"It _has_ been fine,\" he said; and glanced once more over his shoulder.\r\n\"Until all this began.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"those first days. The first three days.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked for a space into one another's faces, and then Denton slid\r\ndown from the wall and took her hand.\r\n\r\n\"To each generation,\" he said, \"the life of its time. I see it all\r\nplainly now. In the city--that is the life to which we were born. To\r\nlive in any other fashion ... Coming here was a dream, and this--is the\r\nawakening.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a pleasant dream,\" she said,--\"in the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long space neither spoke.\r\n\r\n\"If we would reach the city before the shepherds come here, we must\r\nstart,\" said Denton. \"We must get our food out of the house and eat as\r\nwe go.\"\r\n\r\nDenton glanced about him again, and, giving the dead dogs a wide berth,\r\nthey walked across the garden space and into the house together. They\r\nfound the wallet with their food, and descended the blood-stained stairs\r\nagain. In the hall Elizabeth stopped. \"One minute,\" she said. \"There is\r\nsomething here.\"\r\n\r\nShe led the way into the room in which that one little blue flower was\r\nblooming. She stooped to it, she touched it with her hand.\r\n\r\n\"I want it,\" she said; and then, \"I cannot take it....\"\r\n\r\nImpulsively she stooped and kissed its petals.\r\n\r\nThen silently, side by side, they went across the empty garden-space\r\ninto the old high road, and set their faces resolutely towards the\r\ndistant city--towards the complex mechanical city of those latter days,\r\nthe city that had swallowed up mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII--THE WAYS OF THE CITY\r\n\r\nProminent if not paramount among world-changing inventions in the\r\nhistory of man is that series of contrivances in locomotion that began\r\nwith the railway and ended for a century or more with the motor and the\r\npatent road. That these contrivances, together with the device of\r\nlimited liability joint stock companies and the supersession of\r\nagricultural labourers by skilled men with ingenious machinery, would\r\nnecessarily concentrate mankind in cities of unparallelled magnitude and\r\nwork an entire revolution in human life, became, after the event, a\r\nthing so obvious that it is a matter of astonishment it was not more\r\nclearly anticipated. Yet that any steps should be taken to anticipate\r\nthe miseries such a revolution might entail does not appear even to have\r\nbeen suggested; and the idea that the moral prohibitions and sanctions,\r\nthe privileges and concessions, the conception of property and\r\nresponsibility, of comfort and beauty, that had rendered the mainly\r\nagricultural states of the past prosperous and happy, would fail in the\r\nrising torrent of novel opportunities and novel stimulations, never\r\nseems to have entered the nineteenth-century mind. That a citizen,\r\nkindly and fair in his ordinary life, could as a shareholder become\r\nalmost murderously greedy; that commercial methods that were reasonable\r\nand honourable on the old-fashioned countryside, should on an enlarged\r\nscale be deadly and overwhelming; that ancient charity was modern\r\npauperisation, and ancient employment modern sweating; that, in fact, a\r\nrevision and enlargement of the duties and rights of man had become\r\nurgently necessary, were things it could not entertain, nourished as it\r\nwas on an archaic system of education and profoundly retrospective and\r\nlegal in all its habits of thought. It was known that the accumulation\r\nof men in cities involved unprecedented dangers of pestilence; there was\r\nan energetic development of sanitation; but that the diseases of\r\ngambling and usury, of luxury and tyranny should become endemic, and\r\nproduce horrible consequences was beyond the scope of nineteenth-century\r\nthought. And so, as if it were some inorganic process, practically\r\nunhindered by the creative will of man, the growth of the swarming\r\nunhappy cities that mark the twenty-first century accomplished itself.\r\n\r\nThe new society was divided into three main classes. At the summit\r\nslumbered the property owner, enormously rich by accident rather than\r\ndesign, potent save for the will and aim, the last _avatar_ of Hamlet in\r\nthe world. Below was the enormous multitude of workers employed by the\r\ngigantic companies that monopolised control; and between these two the\r\ndwindling middle class, officials of innumerable sorts, foremen,\r\nmanagers, the medical, legal, artistic, and scholastic classes, and the\r\nminor rich, a middle class whose members led a life of insecure luxury\r\nand precarious speculation amidst the movements of the great managers.\r\n\r\nAlready the love story and the marrying of two persons of this middle\r\nclass have been told: how they overcame the obstacles between them, and\r\nhow they tried the simple old-fashioned way of living on the countryside\r\nand came back speedily enough into the city of London. Denton had no\r\nmeans, so Elizabeth borrowed money on the securities that her father\r\nMwres held in trust for her until she was one-and-twenty.\r\n\r\nThe rate of interest she paid was of course high, because of the\r\nuncertainty of her security, and the arithmetic of lovers is often\r\nsketchy and optimistic. Yet they had very glorious times after that\r\nreturn. They determined they would not go to a Pleasure city nor waste\r\ntheir days rushing through the air from one part of the world to the\r\nother, for in spite of one disillusionment, their tastes were still\r\nold-fashioned. They furnished their little room with quaint old\r\nVictorian furniture, and found a shop on the forty-second floor in\r\nSeventh Way where printed books of the old sort were still to be bought.\r\nIt was their pet affectation to read print instead of hearing\r\nphonographs. And when presently there came a sweet little girl, to unite\r\nthem further if it were possible, Elizabeth would not send it to a\r\n_creche_, as the custom was, but insisted on nursing it at home. The\r\nrent of their apartments was raised on account of this singular\r\nproceeding, but that they did not mind. It only meant borrowing a little\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nPresently Elizabeth was of age, and Denton had a business interview with\r\nher father that was not agreeable. An exceedingly disagreeable interview\r\nwith their money-lender followed, from which he brought home a white\r\nface. On his return Elizabeth had to tell him of a new and marvellous\r\nintonation of \"Goo\" that their daughter had devised, but Denton was\r\ninattentive. In the midst, just as she was at the cream of her\r\ndescription, he interrupted. \"How much money do you think we have left,\r\nnow that everything is settled?\"\r\n\r\nShe stared and stopped her appreciative swaying of the Goo genius that\r\nhad accompanied her description.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"Ever so much. We have been wild. It's the interest.\r\nOr something. And the shares you had, slumped. Your father did not mind.\r\nSaid it was not his business, after what had happened. He's going to\r\nmarry again.... Well--we have scarcely a thousand left!\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a thousand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a thousand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Elizabeth sat down. For a moment she regarded him with a white face,\r\nthen her eyes went about the quaint, old-fashioned room, with its middle\r\nVictorian furniture and genuine oleographs, and rested at last on the\r\nlittle lump of humanity within her arms.\r\n\r\nDenton glanced at her and stood downcast. Then he swung round on his\r\nheel and walked up and down very rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"I must get something to do,\" he broke out presently. \"I am an idle\r\nscoundrel. I ought to have thought of this before. I have been a selfish\r\nfool. I wanted to be with you all day....\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, looking at her white face. Suddenly he came and kissed her\r\nand the little face that nestled against her breast.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, dear,\" he said, standing over her; \"you won't be lonely\r\nnow--now Dings is beginning to talk to you. And I can soon get something\r\nto do, you know. Soon.... Easily.... It's only a shock at first. But it\r\nwill come all right. It's sure to come right. I will go out again as\r\nsoon as I have rested, and find what can be done. For the present it's\r\nhard to think of anything....\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be hard to leave these rooms,\" said Elizabeth; \"but----\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be any need of that--trust me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are expensive.\"\r\n\r\nDenton waved that aside. He began talking of the work he could do. He\r\nwas not very explicit what it would be; but he was quite sure that there\r\nwas something to keep them comfortably in the happy middle class, whose\r\nway of life was the only one they knew.\r\n\r\n\"There are three-and-thirty million people in London,\" he said: \"some of\r\nthem _must_ have need of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some _must_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The trouble is ... Well--Bindon, that brown little old man your father\r\nwanted you to marry. He's an important person.... I can't go back to my\r\nflying-stage work, because he is now a Commissioner of the Flying Stage\r\nClerks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know that,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"He was made that in the last few weeks ... or things would be easy\r\nenough, for they liked me on the flying stage. But there's dozens of\r\nother things to be done--dozens. Don't you worry, dear. I'll rest a\r\nlittle while, and then we'll dine, and then I'll start on my rounds. I\r\nknow lots of people--lots.\"\r\n\r\nSo they rested, and then they went to the public dining-room and dined,\r\nand then he started on his search for employment. But they soon realised\r\nthat in the matter of one convenience the world was just as badly off as\r\nit had ever been, and that was a nice, secure, honourable, remunerative\r\nemployment, leaving ample leisure for the private life, and demanding no\r\nspecial ability, no violent exertion nor risk, and no sacrifice of any\r\nsort for its attainment. He evolved a number of brilliant projects, and\r\nspent many days hurrying from one part of the enormous city to another\r\nin search of influential friends; and all his influential friends were\r\nglad to see him, and very sanguine until it came to definite proposals,\r\nand then they became guarded and vague. He would part with them coldly,\r\nand think over their behaviour, and get irritated on his way back, and\r\nstop at some telephone office and spend money on an animated but\r\nunprofitable quarrel. And as the days passed, he got so worried and\r\nirritated that even to seem kind and careless before Elizabeth cost him\r\nan effort--as she, being a loving woman, perceived very clearly.\r\n\r\nAfter an extremely complex preface one day, she helped him out with a\r\npainful suggestion. He had expected her to weep and give way to despair\r\nwhen it came to selling all their joyfully bought early Victorian\r\ntreasures, their quaint objects of art, their antimacassars, bead mats,\r\nrepp curtains, veneered furniture, gold-framed steel engravings and\r\npencil drawings, wax flowers under shades, stuffed birds, and all sorts\r\nof choice old things; but it was she who made the proposal. The\r\nsacrifice seemed to fill her with pleasure, and so did the idea of\r\nshifting to apartments ten or twelve floors lower in another hotel. \"So\r\nlong as Dings is with us, nothing matters,\" she said. \"It's all\r\nexperience.\" So he kissed her, said she was braver than when she fought\r\nthe sheep-dogs, called her Boadicea, and abstained very carefully from\r\nreminding her that they would have to pay a considerably higher rent on\r\naccount of the little voice with which Dings greeted the perpetual\r\nuproar of the city.\r\n\r\nHis idea had been to get Elizabeth out of the way when it came to\r\nselling the absurd furniture about which their affections were twined\r\nand tangled; but when it came to the sale it was Elizabeth who haggled\r\nwith the dealer while Denton went about the running ways of the city,\r\nwhite and sick with sorrow and the fear of what was still to come. When\r\nthey moved into their sparsely furnished pink-and-white apartments in a\r\ncheap hotel, there came an outbreak of furious energy on his part, and\r\nthen nearly a week of lethargy during which he sulked at home. Through\r\nthose days Elizabeth shone like a star, and at the end Denton's misery\r\nfound a vent in tears. And then he went out into the city ways again,\r\nand--to his utter amazement--found some work to do.\r\n\r\nHis standard of employment had fallen steadily until at last it had\r\nreached the lowest level of independent workers. At first he had aspired\r\nto some high official position in the great Flying or Wind Vane or Water\r\nCompanies, or to an appointment on one of the General Intelligence\r\nOrganisations that had replaced newspapers, or to some professional\r\npartnership, but those were the dreams of the beginning. From that he\r\nhad passed to speculation, and three hundred gold \"lions\" out of\r\nElizabeth's thousand had vanished one evening in the share market. Now\r\nhe was glad his good looks secured him a trial in the position of\r\nsalesman to the Suzannah Hat Syndicate, a Syndicate, dealing in ladies'\r\ncaps, hair decorations, and hats--for though the city was completely\r\ncovered in, ladies still wore extremely elaborate and beautiful hats at\r\nthe theatres and places of public worship.\r\n\r\nIt would have been amusing if one could have confronted a Regent Street\r\nshopkeeper of the nineteenth century with the development of his\r\nestablishment in which Denton's duties lay. Nineteenth Way was still\r\nsometimes called Regent Street, but it was now a street of moving\r\nplatforms and nearly eight hundred feet wide. The middle space was\r\nimmovable and gave access by staircases descending into subterranean\r\nways to the houses on either side. Right and left were an ascending\r\nseries of continuous platforms each of which travelled about five miles\r\nan hour faster than the one internal to it, so that one could step from\r\nplatform to platform until one reached the swiftest outer way and so go\r\nabout the city. The establishment of the Suzannah Hat Syndicate\r\nprojected a vast _façade_ upon the outer way, sending out overhead at\r\neither end an overlapping series of huge white glass screens, on which\r\ngigantic animated pictures of the faces of well-known beautiful living\r\nwomen wearing novelties in hats were thrown. A dense crowd was always\r\ncollected in the stationary central way watching a vast kinematograph\r\nwhich displayed the changing fashion. The whole front of the building\r\nwas in perpetual chromatic change, and all down the _façade_--four\r\nhundred feet it measured--and all across the street of moving ways,\r\nlaced and winked and glittered in a thousand varieties of colour and\r\nlettering the inscription--\r\n\r\n    SUZANNA! 'ETS! SUZANNA! 'ETS!\r\n\r\nA broadside of gigantic phonographs drowned all conversation in the\r\nmoving way and roared \"_hats_\" at the passer-by, while far down the\r\nstreet and up, other batteries counselled the public to \"walk down for\r\nSuzannah,\" and queried, \"Why _don't_ you buy the girl a hat?\"\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who chanced to be deaf--and deafness was not\r\nuncommon in the London of that age, inscriptions of all sizes were\r\nthrown from the roof above upon the moving platforms themselves, and on\r\none's hand or on the bald head of the man before one, or on a lady's\r\nshoulders, or in a sudden jet of flame before one's feet, the moving\r\nfinger wrote in unanticipated letters of fire \"_'ets r chip t'de_,\" or\r\nsimply \"_'ets_.\" And spite of all these efforts so high was the pitch at\r\nwhich the city lived, so trained became one's eyes and ears to ignore\r\nall sorts of advertisement, that many a citizen had passed that place\r\nthousands of times and was still unaware of the existence of the\r\nSuzannah Hat Syndicate.\r\n\r\nTo enter the building one descended the staircase in the middle way and\r\nwalked through a public passage in which pretty girls promenaded, girls\r\nwho were willing to wear a ticketed hat for a small fee. The entrance\r\nchamber was a large hall in which wax heads fashionably adorned rotated\r\ngracefully upon pedestals, and from this one passed through a cash\r\noffice to an interminable series of little rooms, each room with its\r\nsalesman, its three or four hats and pins, its mirrors, its\r\nkinematographs, telephones and hat slides in communication with the\r\ncentral depôt, its comfortable lounge and tempting refreshments. A\r\nsalesman in such an apartment did Denton now become. It was his business\r\nto attend to any of the incessant stream of ladies who chose to stop\r\nwith him, to behave as winningly as possible, to offer refreshment, to\r\nconverse on any topic the possible customer chose, and to guide the\r\nconversation dexterously but not insistently towards hats. He was to\r\nsuggest trying on various types of hat and to show by his manner and\r\nbearing, but without any coarse flattery, the enhanced impression made\r\nby the hats he wished to sell. He had several mirrors, adapted by\r\nvarious subtleties of curvature and tint to different types of face and\r\ncomplexion, and much depended on the proper use of these.\r\n\r\nDenton flung himself at these curious and not very congenial duties with\r\na good will and energy that would have amazed him a year before; but all\r\nto no purpose. The Senior Manageress, who had selected him for\r\nappointment and conferred various small marks of favour upon him,\r\nsuddenly changed in her manner, declared for no assignable cause that he\r\nwas stupid, and dismissed him at the end of six weeks of salesmanship.\r\nSo Denton had to resume his ineffectual search for employment.\r\n\r\nThis second search did not last very long. Their money was at the ebb.\r\nTo eke it out a little longer they resolved to part with their darling\r\nDings, and took that small person to one of the public _creches_ that\r\nabounded in the city. That was the common use of the time. The\r\nindustrial emancipation of women, the correlated disorganisation of the\r\nsecluded \"home,\" had rendered _creches_ a necessity for all but very\r\nrich and exceptionally-minded people. Therein children encountered\r\nhygienic and educational advantages impossible without such\r\norganisation. _Creches_ were of all classes and types of luxury, down to\r\nthose of the Labour Company, where children were taken on credit, to be\r\nredeemed in labour as they grew up.\r\n\r\nBut both Denton and Elizabeth being, as I have explained, strange\r\nold-fashioned young people, full of nineteenth-century ideas, hated\r\nthese convenient _creches_ exceedingly and at last took their little\r\ndaughter to one with extreme reluctance. They were received by a\r\nmotherly person in a uniform who was very brisk and prompt in her manner\r\nuntil Elizabeth wept at the mention of parting from her child. The\r\nmotherly person, after a brief astonishment at this unusual emotion,\r\nchanged suddenly into a creature of hope and comfort, and so won\r\nElizabeth's gratitude for life. They were conducted into a vast room\r\npresided over by several nurses and with hundreds of two-year-old girls\r\ngrouped about the toy-covered floor. This was the Two-year-old Room.\r\nTwo nurses came forward, and Elizabeth watched their bearing towards\r\nDings with jealous eyes. They were kind--it was clear they felt kind,\r\nand yet ...\r\n\r\nPresently it was time to go. By that time Dings was happily established\r\nin a corner, sitting on the floor with her arms filled, and herself,\r\nindeed, for the most part hidden by an unaccustomed wealth of toys. She\r\nseemed careless of all human relationships as her parents receded.\r\n\r\nThey were forbidden to upset her by saying good-bye.\r\n\r\nAt the door Elizabeth glanced back for the last time, and behold! Dings\r\nhad dropped her new wealth and was standing with a dubious face.\r\nSuddenly Elizabeth gasped, and the motherly nurse pushed her forward and\r\nclosed the door.\r\n\r\n\"You can come again soon, dear,\" she said, with unexpected tenderness in\r\nher eyes. For a moment Elizabeth stared at her with a blank face. \"You\r\ncan come again soon,\" repeated the nurse. Then with a swift transition\r\nElizabeth was weeping in the nurse's arms. So it was that Denton's heart\r\nwas won also.\r\n\r\nAnd three weeks after our young people were absolutely penniless, and\r\nonly one way lay open. They must go to the Labour Company. So soon as\r\nthe rent was a week overdue their few remaining possessions were seized,\r\nand with scant courtesy they were shown the way out of the hotel.\r\nElizabeth walked along the passage towards the staircase that ascended\r\nto the motionless middle way, too dulled by misery to think. Denton\r\nstopped behind to finish a stinging and unsatisfactory argument with the\r\nhotel porter, and then came hurrying after her, flushed and hot. He\r\nslackened his pace as he overtook her, and together they ascended to the\r\nmiddle way in silence. There they found two seats vacant and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"We need not go there--_yet_?\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"No--not till we are hungry,\" said Denton.\r\n\r\nThey said no more.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's eyes sought a resting-place and found none. To the right\r\nroared the eastward ways, to the left the ways in the opposite\r\ndirection, swarming with people. Backwards and forwards along a cable\r\noverhead rushed a string of gesticulating men, dressed like clowns, each\r\nmarked on back and chest with one gigantic letter, so that altogether\r\nthey spelt out:\r\n\r\n    \"PURKINJE'S DIGESTIVE PILLS.\"\r\n\r\nAn anæmic little woman in horrible coarse blue canvas pointed a little\r\ngirl to one of this string of hurrying advertisements.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" said the anæmic woman: \"there's yer father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which?\" said the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"'Im wiv his nose coloured red,\" said the anæmic woman.\r\n\r\nThe little girl began to cry, and Elizabeth could have cried too.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't 'e kickin' 'is legs!--_just!_\" said the anæmic woman in blue,\r\ntrying to make things bright again. \"Looky--_now!_\"\r\n\r\nOn the _façade_ to the right a huge intensely bright disc of weird\r\ncolour span incessantly, and letters of fire that came and went spelt\r\nout--\r\n\r\n    \"DOES THIS MAKE YOU GIDDY?\"\r\n\r\nThen a pause, followed by\r\n\r\n    \"TAKE A PURKINJE'S DIGESTIVE PILL.\"\r\n\r\nA vast and desolating braying began. \"If you love Swagger Literature,\r\nput your telephone on to Bruggles, the Greatest Author of all Time. The\r\nGreatest Thinker of all Time. Teaches you Morals up to your Scalp! The\r\nvery image of Socrates, except the back of his head, which is like\r\nShakspeare. He has six toes, dresses in red, and never cleans his teeth.\r\nHear HIM!\"\r\n\r\nDenton's voice became audible in a gap in the uproar. \"I never ought to\r\nhave married you,\" he was saying. \"I have wasted your money, ruined you,\r\nbrought you to misery. I am a scoundrel.... Oh, this accursed world!\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to speak, and for some moments could not. She grasped his\r\nhand. \"No,\" she said at last.\r\n\r\nA half-formed desire suddenly became determination. She stood up. \"Will\r\nyou come?\"\r\n\r\nHe rose also. \"We need not go there yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that. But I want you to come to the flying stages--where we met.\r\nYou know? The little seat.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. \"_Can_ you?\" he said, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Must,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated still for a moment, then moved to obey her will.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was they spent their last half-day of freedom out under the\r\nopen air in the little seat under the flying stages where they had been\r\nwont to meet five short years ago. There she told him, what she could\r\nnot tell him in the tumultuous public ways, that she did not repent even\r\nnow of their marriage--that whatever discomfort and misery life still\r\nhad for them, she was content with the things that had been. The weather\r\nwas kind to them, the seat was sunlit and warm, and overhead the shining\r\naëroplanes went and came.\r\n\r\nAt last towards sunsetting their time was at an end, and they made their\r\nvows to one another and clasped hands, and then rose up and went back\r\ninto the ways of the city, a shabby-looking, heavy-hearted pair, tired\r\nand hungry. Soon they came to one of the pale blue signs that marked a\r\nLabour Company Bureau. For a space they stood in the middle way\r\nregarding this and at last descended, and entered the waiting-room.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Company had originally been a charitable organisation; its\r\naim was to supply food, shelter, and work to all comers. This it was\r\nbound to do by the conditions of its incorporation, and it was also\r\nbound to supply food and shelter and medical attendance to all incapable\r\nof work who chose to demand its aid. In exchange these incapables paid\r\nlabour notes, which they had to redeem upon recovery. They signed these\r\nlabour notes with thumb-marks, which were photographed and indexed in\r\nsuch a way that this world-wide Labour Company could identify any one of\r\nits two or three hundred million clients at the cost of an hour's\r\ninquiry. The day's labour was defined as two spells in a treadmill used\r\nin generating electrical force, or its equivalent, and its due\r\nperformance could be enforced by law. In practice the Labour Company\r\nfound it advisable to add to its statutory obligations of food and\r\nshelter a few pence a day as an inducement to effort; and its enterprise\r\nhad not only abolished pauperisation altogether, but supplied\r\npractically all but the very highest and most responsible labour\r\nthroughout the world. Nearly a third of the population of the world were\r\nits serfs and debtors from the cradle to the grave.\r\n\r\nIn this practical, unsentimental way the problem of the unemployed had\r\nbeen most satisfactorily met and overcome. No one starved in the public\r\nways, and no rags, no costume less sanitary and sufficient than the\r\nLabour Company's hygienic but inelegant blue canvas, pained the eye\r\nthroughout the whole world. It was the constant theme of the\r\nphonographic newspapers how much the world had progressed since\r\nnineteenth-century days, when the bodies of those killed by the\r\nvehicular traffic or dead of starvation, were, they alleged, a common\r\nfeature in all the busier streets.\r\n\r\nDenton and Elizabeth sat apart in the waiting-room until their turn\r\ncame. Most of the others collected there seemed limp and taciturn, but\r\nthree or four young people gaudily dressed made up for the quietude of\r\ntheir companions. They were life clients of the Company, born in the\r\nCompany's _creche_ and destined to die in its hospital, and they had\r\nbeen out for a spree with some shillings or so of extra pay. They talked\r\nvociferously in a later development of the Cockney dialect, manifestly\r\nvery proud of themselves.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's eyes went from these to the less assertive figures. One\r\nseemed exceptionally pitiful to her. It was a woman of perhaps\r\nforty-five, with gold-stained hair and a painted face, down which\r\nabundant tears had trickled; she had a pinched nose, hungry eyes, lean\r\nhands and shoulders, and her dusty worn-out finery told the story of her\r\nlife. Another was a grey-bearded old man in the costume of a bishop of\r\none of the high episcopal sects--for religion was now also a business,\r\nand had its ups and downs. And beside him a sickly, dissipated-looking\r\nboy of perhaps two-and-twenty glared at Fate.\r\n\r\nPresently Elizabeth and then Denton interviewed the manageress--for the\r\nCompany preferred women in this capacity--and found she possessed an\r\nenergetic face, a contemptuous manner, and a particularly unpleasant\r\nvoice. They were given various checks, including one to certify that\r\nthey need not have their heads cropped; and when they had given their\r\nthumb-marks, learnt the number corresponding thereunto, and exchanged\r\ntheir shabby middle-class clothes for duly numbered blue canvas suits,\r\nthey repaired to the huge plain dining-room for their first meal under\r\nthese new conditions. Afterwards they were to return to her for\r\ninstructions about their work.\r\n\r\nWhen they had made the exchange of their clothing Elizabeth did not seem\r\nable to look at Denton at first; but he looked at her, and saw with\r\nastonishment that even in blue canvas she was still beautiful. And then\r\ntheir soup and bread came sliding on its little rail down the long table\r\ntowards them and stopped with a jerk, and he forgot the matter. For they\r\nhad had no proper meal for three days.\r\n\r\nAfter they had dined they rested for a time. Neither talked--there was\r\nnothing to say; and presently they got up and went back to the\r\nmanageress to learn what they had to do.\r\n\r\nThe manageress referred to a tablet. \"Y'r rooms won't be here; it'll be\r\nin the Highbury Ward, Ninety-seventh Way, number two thousand and\r\nseventeen. Better make a note of it on y'r card. _You_, nought nought\r\nnought, type seven, sixty-four, b.c.d., _gamma_ forty-one, female; you\r\n'ave to go to the Metal-beating Company and try that for a\r\nday--fourpence bonus if ye're satisfactory; and _you_, nought seven one,\r\ntype four, seven hundred and nine, g.f.b., _pi_ five and ninety, male;\r\nyou 'ave to go to the Photographic Company on Eighty-first Way, and\r\nlearn something or other--_I_ don't know--thrippence. 'Ere's y'r cards.\r\nThat's all. Next! _What?_ Didn't catch it all? Lor! So suppose I must go\r\nover it all again. Why don't you listen? Keerless, unprovident people!\r\nOne'd think these things didn't matter.\"\r\n\r\nTheir ways to their work lay together for a time. And now they found\r\nthey could talk. Curiously enough, the worst of their depression seemed\r\nover now that they had actually donned the blue. Denton could talk with\r\ninterest even of the work that lay before them. \"Whatever it is,\" he\r\nsaid, \"it can't be so hateful as that hat shop. And after we have paid\r\nfor Dings, we shall still have a whole penny a day between us even now.\r\nAfterwards--we may improve,--get more money.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth was less inclined to speech. \"I wonder why work should seem\r\nso hateful,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"It's odd,\" said Denton. \"I suppose it wouldn't be if it were not the\r\nthought of being ordered about.... I hope we shall have decent\r\nmanagers.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth did not answer. She was not thinking of that. She was tracing\r\nout some thoughts of her own.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she said presently, \"we have been using up work all our\r\nlives. It's only fair--\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped. It was too intricate.\r\n\r\n\"We paid for it,\" said Denton, for at that time he had not troubled\r\nhimself about these complicated things.\r\n\r\n\"We did nothing--and yet we paid for it. That's what I cannot\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we are paying,\" said Elizabeth presently--for her theology was\r\nold-fashioned and simple.\r\n\r\nPresently it was time for them to part, and each went to the appointed\r\nwork. Denton's was to mind a complicated hydraulic press that seemed\r\nalmost an intelligent thing. This press worked by the sea-water that was\r\ndestined finally to flush the city drains--for the world had long since\r\nabandoned the folly of pouring drinkable water into its sewers. This\r\nwater was brought close to the eastward edge of the city by a huge\r\ncanal, and then raised by an enormous battery of pumps into reservoirs\r\nat a level of four hundred feet above the sea, from which it spread by a\r\nbillion arterial branches over the city. Thence it poured down,\r\ncleansing, sluicing, working machinery of all sorts, through an infinite\r\nvariety of capillary channels into the great drains, the _cloacae\r\nmaximae_, and so carried the sewage out to the agricultural areas that\r\nsurrounded London on every side.\r\n\r\nThe press was employed in one of the processes of the photographic\r\nmanufacture, but the nature of the process it did not concern Denton to\r\nunderstand. The most salient fact to his mind was that it had to be\r\nconducted in ruby light, and as a consequence the room in which he\r\nworked was lit by one coloured globe that poured a lurid and painful\r\nillumination about the room. In the darkest corner stood the press whose\r\nservant Denton had now become: it was a huge, dim, glittering thing with\r\na projecting hood that had a remote resemblance to a bowed head, and,\r\nsquatting like some metal Buddha in this weird light that ministered to\r\nits needs, it seemed to Denton in certain moods almost as if this must\r\nneeds be the obscure idol to which humanity in some strange aberration\r\nhad offered up his life. His duties had a varied monotony. Such items as\r\nthe following will convey an idea of the service of the press. The thing\r\nworked with a busy clicking so long as things went well; but if the\r\npaste that came pouring through a feeder from another room and which it\r\nwas perpetually compressing into thin plates, changed in quality the\r\nrhythm of its click altered and Denton hastened to make certain\r\nadjustments. The slightest delay involved a waste of paste and the\r\ndocking of one or more of his daily pence. If the supply of paste\r\nwaned--there were hand processes of a peculiar sort involved in its\r\npreparation, and sometimes the workers had convulsions which deranged\r\ntheir output--Denton had to throw the press out of gear. In the painful\r\nvigilance a multitude of such trivial attentions entailed, painful\r\nbecause of the incessant effort its absence of natural interest\r\nrequired, Denton had now to pass one-third of his days. Save for an\r\noccasional visit from the manager, a kindly but singularly foul-mouthed\r\nman, Denton passed his working hours in solitude.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's work was of a more social sort. There was a fashion for\r\ncovering the private apartments of the very wealthy with metal plates\r\nbeautifully embossed with repeated patterns. The taste of the time\r\ndemanded, however, that the repetition of the patterns should not be\r\nexact--not mechanical, but \"natural\"--and it was found that the most\r\npleasing arrangement of pattern irregularity was obtained by employing\r\nwomen of refinement and natural taste to punch out the patterns with\r\nsmall dies. So many square feet of plates was exacted from Elizabeth as\r\na minimum, and for whatever square feet she did in excess she received a\r\nsmall payment. The room, like most rooms of women workers, was under a\r\nmanageress: men had been found by the Labour Company not only less\r\nexacting but extremely liable to excuse favoured ladies from a proper\r\nshare of their duties. The manageress was a not unkindly, taciturn\r\nperson, with the hardened remains of beauty of the brunette type; and\r\nthe other women workers, who of course hated her, associated her name\r\nscandalously with one of the metal-work directors in order to explain\r\nher position.\r\n\r\nOnly two or three of Elizabeth's fellow-workers were born labour serfs;\r\nplain, morose girls, but most of them corresponded to what the\r\nnineteenth century would have called a \"reduced\" gentlewoman. But the\r\nideal of what constituted a gentlewoman had altered: the faint, faded,\r\nnegative virtue, the modulated voice and restrained gesture of the\r\nold-fashioned gentlewoman had vanished from the earth. Most of her\r\ncompanions showed in discoloured hair, ruined complexions, and the\r\ntexture of their reminiscent conversations, the vanished glories of a\r\nconquering youth. All of these artistic workers were much older than\r\nElizabeth, and two openly expressed their surprise that any one so young\r\nand pleasant should come to share their toil. But Elizabeth did not\r\ntrouble them with her old-world moral conceptions.\r\n\r\nThey were permitted, and even encouraged to converse with each other,\r\nfor the directors very properly judged that anything that conduced to\r\nvariations of mood made for pleasing fluctuations in their patterning;\r\nand Elizabeth was almost forced to hear the stories of these lives with\r\nwhich her own interwove: garbled and distorted they were by vanity\r\nindeed and yet comprehensible enough. And soon she began to appreciate\r\nthe small spites and cliques, the little misunderstandings and alliances\r\nthat enmeshed about her. One woman was excessively garrulous and\r\ndescriptive about a wonderful son of hers; another had cultivated a\r\nfoolish coarseness of speech, that she seemed to regard as the wittiest\r\nexpression of originality conceivable; a third mused for ever on dress,\r\nand whispered to Elizabeth how she saved her pence day after day, and\r\nwould presently have a glorious day of freedom, wearing ... and then\r\nfollowed hours of description; two others sat always together, and\r\ncalled one another pet names, until one day some little thing happened,\r\nand they sat apart, blind and deaf as it seemed to one another's being.\r\nAnd always from them all came an incessant tap, tap, tap, tap, and the\r\nmanageress listened always to the rhythm to mark if one fell away. Tap,\r\ntap, tap, tap: so their days passed, so their lives must pass. Elizabeth\r\nsat among them, kindly and quiet, grey-hearted, marvelling at Fate: tap,\r\ntap, tap; tap, tap, tap; tap, tap, tap.\r\n\r\nSo there came to Denton and Elizabeth a long succession of laborious\r\ndays, that hardened their hands, wove strange threads of some new and\r\nsterner substance into the soft prettiness of their lives, and drew\r\ngrave lines and shadows on their faces. The bright, convenient ways of\r\nthe former life had receded to an inaccessible distance; slowly they\r\nlearnt the lesson of the underworld--sombre and laborious, vast and\r\npregnant. There were many little things happened: things that would be\r\ntedious and miserable to tell, things that were bitter and grievous to\r\nbear--indignities, tyrannies, such as must ever season the bread of the\r\npoor in cities; and one thing that was not little, but seemed like the\r\nutter blackening of life to them, which was that the child they had\r\ngiven life to sickened and died. But that story, that ancient,\r\nperpetually recurring story, has been told so often, has been told so\r\nbeautifully, that there is no need to tell it over again here. There was\r\nthe same sharp fear, the same long anxiety, the deferred inevitable\r\nblow, and the black silence. It has always been the same; it will always\r\nbe the same. It is one of the things that must be.\r\n\r\nAnd it was Elizabeth who was the first to speak, after an aching, dull\r\ninterspace of days: not, indeed, of the foolish little name that was a\r\nname no longer, but of the darkness that brooded over her soul. They had\r\ncome through the shrieking, tumultuous ways of the city together; the\r\nclamour of trade, of yelling competitive religions, of political appeal,\r\nhad beat upon deaf ears; the glare of focussed lights, of dancing\r\nletters, and fiery advertisements, had fallen upon the set, miserable\r\nfaces unheeded. They took their dinner in the dining-hall at a place\r\napart. \"I want,\" said Elizabeth clumsily, \"to go out to the flying\r\nstages--to that seat. Here, one can say nothing....\"\r\n\r\nDenton looked at her. \"It will be night,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I have asked,--it is a fine night.\" She stopped.\r\n\r\nHe perceived she could find no words to explain herself. Suddenly he\r\nunderstood that she wished to see the stars once more, the stars they\r\nhad watched together from the open downland in that wild honeymoon of\r\ntheirs five years ago. Something caught at his throat. He looked away\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n\"There will be plenty of time to go,\" he said, in a matter-of-fact tone.\r\n\r\nAnd at last they came out to their little seat on the flying stage, and\r\nsat there for a long time in silence. The little seat was in shadow, but\r\nthe zenith was pale blue with the effulgence of the stage overhead, and\r\nall the city spread below them, squares and circles and patches of\r\nbrilliance caught in a mesh-work of light. The little stars seemed very\r\nfaint and small: near as they had been to the old-world watcher, they\r\nhad become now infinitely remote. Yet one could see them in the darkened\r\npatches amidst the glare, and especially in the northward sky, the\r\nancient constellations gliding steadfast and patient about the pole.\r\n\r\nLong our two people sat in silence, and at last Elizabeth sighed.\r\n\r\n\"If I understood,\" she said, \"if I could understand. When one is down\r\nthere the city seems everything--the noise, the hurry, the voices--you\r\nmust live, you must scramble. Here--it is nothing; a thing that passes.\r\nOne can think in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Denton. \"How flimsy it all is! From here more than half of\r\nit is swallowed by the night.... It will pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall pass first,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Denton. \"If life were not a moment, the whole of history\r\nwould seem like the happening of a day.... Yes--we shall pass. And the\r\ncity will pass, and all the things that are to come. Man and the Overman\r\nand wonders unspeakable. And yet ...\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then began afresh. \"I know what you feel. At least I\r\nfancy.... Down there one thinks of one's work, one's little vexations\r\nand pleasures, one's eating and drinking and ease and pain. One lives,\r\nand one must die. Down there and everyday--our sorrow seemed the end of\r\nlife....\r\n\r\n\"Up here it is different. For instance, down there it would seem\r\nimpossible almost to go on living if one were horribly disfigured,\r\nhorribly crippled, disgraced. Up here--under these stars--none of those\r\nthings would matter. They don't matter.... They are a part of something.\r\nOne seems just to touch that something--under the stars....\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The vague, impalpable things in his mind, cloudy emotions\r\nhalf shaped towards ideas, vanished before the rough grasp of words. \"It\r\nis hard to express,\" he said lamely.\r\n\r\nThey sat through a long stillness.\r\n\r\n\"It is well to come here,\" he said at last. \"We stop--our minds are very\r\nfinite. After all we are just poor animals rising out of the brute, each\r\nwith a mind, the poor beginning of a mind. We are so stupid. So much\r\nhurts. And yet ...\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know--and some day we shall _see_.\r\n\r\n\"All this frightful stress, all this discord will resolve to harmony,\r\nand we shall know it. Nothing is but it makes for that. Nothing. All the\r\nfailures--every little thing makes for that harmony. Everything is\r\nnecessary to it, we shall find. We shall find. Nothing, not even the\r\nmost dreadful thing, could be left out. Not even the most trivial.\r\nEvery tap of your hammer on the brass, every moment of work, my idleness\r\neven ... Dear one! every movement of our poor little one ... All these\r\nthings go on for ever. And the faint impalpable things. We, sitting here\r\ntogether.--Everything ...\r\n\r\n\"The passion that joined us, and what has come since. It is not passion\r\nnow. More than anything else it is sorrow. _Dear_ ...\"\r\n\r\nHe could say no more, could follow his thoughts no further.\r\n\r\nElizabeth made no answer--she was very still; but presently her hand\r\nsought his and found it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV--UNDERNEATH\r\n\r\nUnder the stars one may reach upward and touch resignation, whatever the\r\nevil thing may be, but in the heat and stress of the day's work we lapse\r\nagain, come disgust and anger and intolerable moods. How little is all\r\nour magnanimity--an accident! a phase! The very Saints of old had first\r\nto flee the world. And Denton and his Elizabeth could not flee their\r\nworld, no longer were there open roads to unclaimed lands where men\r\nmight live freely--however hardly--and keep their souls in peace. The\r\ncity had swallowed up mankind.\r\n\r\nFor a time these two Labour Serfs were kept at their original\r\noccupations, she at her brass stamping and Denton at his press; and then\r\ncame a move for him that brought with it fresh and still bitterer\r\nexperiences of life in the underways of the great city. He was\r\ntransferred to the care of a rather more elaborate press in the central\r\nfactory of the London Tile Trust.\r\n\r\nIn this new situation he had to work in a long vaulted room with a\r\nnumber of other men, for the most part born Labour Serfs. He came to\r\nthis intercourse reluctantly. His upbringing had been refined, and,\r\nuntil his ill fortune had brought him to that costume, he had never\r\nspoken in his life, except by way of command or some immediate\r\nnecessity, to the white-faced wearers of the blue canvas. Now at last\r\ncame contact; he had to work beside them, share their tools, eat with\r\nthem. To both Elizabeth and himself this seemed a further degradation.\r\n\r\nHis taste would have seemed extreme to a man of the nineteenth century.\r\nBut slowly and inevitably in the intervening years a gulf had opened\r\nbetween the wearers of the blue canvas and the classes above, a\r\ndifference not simply of circumstances and habits of life, but of habits\r\nof thought--even of language. The underways had developed a dialect of\r\ntheir own: above, too, had arisen a dialect, a code of thought, a\r\nlanguage of \"culture,\" which aimed by a sedulous search after fresh\r\ndistinction to widen perpetually the space between itself and\r\n\"vulgarity.\" The bond of a common faith, moreover, no longer held the\r\nrace together. The last years of the nineteenth century were\r\ndistinguished by the rapid development among the prosperous idle of\r\nesoteric perversions of the popular religion: glosses and\r\ninterpretations that reduced the broad teachings of the carpenter of\r\nNazareth to the exquisite narrowness of their lives. And, spite of their\r\ninclination towards the ancient fashion of living, neither Elizabeth nor\r\nDenton had been sufficiently original to escape the suggestion of their\r\nsurroundings. In matters of common behaviour they had followed the ways\r\nof their class, and so when they fell at last to be Labour Serfs it\r\nseemed to them almost as though they were falling among offensive\r\ninferior animals; they felt as a nineteenth-century duke and duchess\r\nmight have felt who were forced to take rooms in the Jago.\r\n\r\nTheir natural impulse was to maintain a \"distance.\" But Denton's first\r\nidea of a dignified isolation from his new surroundings was soon rudely\r\ndispelled. He had imagined that his fall to the position of a Labour\r\nSerf was the end of his lesson, that when their little daughter had died\r\nhe had plumbed the deeps of life; but indeed these things were only the\r\nbeginning. Life demands something more from us than acquiescence. And\r\nnow in a roomful of machine minders he was to learn a wider lesson, to\r\nmake the acquaintance of another factor in life, a factor as elemental\r\nas the loss of things dear to us, more elemental even than toil.\r\n\r\nHis quiet discouragement of conversation was an immediate cause of\r\noffence--was interpreted, rightly enough I fear, as disdain. His\r\nignorance of the vulgar dialect, a thing upon which he had hitherto\r\nprided himself, suddenly took upon itself a new aspect. He failed to\r\nperceive at once that his reception of the coarse and stupid but\r\ngenially intended remarks that greeted his appearance must have stung\r\nthe makers of these advances like blows in their faces. \"Don't\r\nunderstand,\" he said rather coldly, and at hazard, \"No, thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who had addressed him stared, scowled, and turned away.\r\n\r\nA second, who also failed at Denton's unaccustomed ear, took the trouble\r\nto repeat his remark, and Denton discovered he was being offered the use\r\nof an oil can. He expressed polite thanks, and this second man embarked\r\nupon a penetrating conversation. Denton, he remarked, had been a swell,\r\nand he wanted to know how he had come to wear the blue. He clearly\r\nexpected an interesting record of vice and extravagance. Had Denton ever\r\nbeen at a Pleasure City? Denton was speedily to discover how the\r\nexistence of these wonderful places of delight permeated and defiled the\r\nthought and honour of these unwilling, hopeless workers of the\r\nunderworld.\r\n\r\nHis aristocratic temperament resented these questions. He answered \"No\"\r\ncurtly. The man persisted with a still more personal question, and this\r\ntime it was Denton who turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Gorblimey!\" said his interlocutor, much astonished.\r\n\r\nIt presently forced itself upon Denton's mind that this remarkable\r\nconversation was being repeated in indignant tones to more sympathetic\r\nhearers, and that it gave rise to astonishment and ironical laughter.\r\nThey looked at Denton with manifestly enhanced interest. A curious\r\nperception of isolation dawned upon him. He tried to think of his press\r\nand its unfamiliar peculiarities....\r\n\r\nThe machines kept everybody pretty busy during the first spell, and\r\nthen came a recess. It was only an interval for refreshment, too brief\r\nfor any one to go out to a Labour Company dining-room. Denton followed\r\nhis fellow-workers into a short gallery, in which were a number of bins\r\nof refuse from the presses.\r\n\r\nEach man produced a packet of food. Denton had no packet. The manager, a\r\ncareless young man who held his position by influence, had omitted to\r\nwarn Denton that it was necessary to apply for this provision. He stood\r\napart, feeling hungry. The others drew together in a group and talked in\r\nundertones, glancing at him ever and again. He became uneasy. His\r\nappearance of disregard cost him an increasing effort. He tried to think\r\nof the levers of his new press.\r\n\r\nPresently one, a man shorter but much broader and stouter than Denton,\r\ncame forward to him. Denton turned to him as unconcernedly as possible.\r\n\"Here!\" said the delegate--as Denton judged him to be--extending a cube\r\nof bread in a not too clean hand. He had a swart, broad-nosed face, and\r\nhis mouth hung down towards one corner.\r\n\r\nDenton felt doubtful for the instant whether this was meant for civility\r\nor insult. His impulse was to decline. \"No, thanks,\" he said; and, at\r\nthe man's change of expression, \"I'm not hungry.\"\r\n\r\nThere came a laugh from the group behind. \"Told you so,\" said the man\r\nwho had offered Denton the loan of an oil can. \"He's top side, he is.\r\nYou ain't good enough for 'im.\"\r\n\r\nThe swart face grew a shade darker.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said its owner, still extending the bread, and speaking in a\r\nlower tone; \"you got to eat this. See?\"\r\n\r\nDenton looked into the threatening face before him, and odd little\r\ncurrents of energy seemed to be running through his limbs and body.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want it,\" he said, trying a pleasant smile that twitched and\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nThe thickset man advanced his face, and the bread became a physical\r\nthreat in his hand. Denton's mind rushed together to the one problem of\r\nhis antagonist's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Eat it,\" said the swart man.\r\n\r\nThere came a pause, and then they both moved quickly. The cube of bread\r\ndescribed a complicated path, a curve that would have ended in Denton's\r\nface; and then his fist hit the wrist of the hand that gripped it, and\r\nit flew upward, and out of the conflict--its part played.\r\n\r\nHe stepped back quickly, fists clenched and arms tense. The hot, dark\r\ncountenance receded, became an alert hostility, watching its chance.\r\nDenton for one instant felt confident, and strangely buoyant and serene.\r\nHis heart beat quickly. He felt his body alive, and glowing to the tips.\r\n\r\n\"Scrap, boys!\" shouted some one, and then the dark figure had leapt\r\nforward, ducked back and sideways, and come in again. Denton struck out,\r\nand was hit. One of his eyes seemed to him to be demolished, and he felt\r\na soft lip under his fist just before he was hit again--this time under\r\nthe chin. A huge fan of fiery needles shot open. He had a momentary\r\npersuasion that his head was knocked to pieces, and then something hit\r\nhis head and back from behind, and the fight became an uninteresting, an\r\nimpersonal thing.\r\n\r\nHe was aware that time--seconds or minutes--had passed, abstract,\r\nuneventful time. He was lying with his head in a heap of ashes, and\r\nsomething wet and warm ran swiftly into his neck. The first shock broke\r\nup into discrete sensations. All his head throbbed; his eye and his chin\r\nthrobbed exceedingly, and the taste of blood was in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"He's all right,\" said a voice. \"He's opening his eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Serve him----well right,\" said a second.\r\n\r\nHis mates were standing about him. He made an effort and sat up. He put\r\nhis hand to the back of his head, and his hair was wet and full of\r\ncinders. A laugh greeted the gesture. His eye was partially closed. He\r\nperceived what had happened. His momentary anticipation of a final\r\nvictory had vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Looks surprised,\" said some one.\r\n\r\n\"'Ave any more?\" said a wit; and then, imitating Denton's refined\r\naccent.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you.\"\r\n\r\nDenton perceived the swart man with a blood-stained handkerchief before\r\nhis face, and somewhat in the background.\r\n\r\n\"Where's that bit of bread he's got to eat?\" said a little ferret-faced\r\ncreature; and sought with his foot in the ashes of the adjacent bin.\r\n\r\nDenton had a moment of internal debate. He knew the code of honour\r\nrequires a man to pursue a fight he has begun to the bitter end; but\r\nthis was his first taste of the bitterness. He was resolved to rise\r\nagain, but he felt no passionate impulse. It occurred to him--and the\r\nthought was no very violent spur--that he was perhaps after all a\r\ncoward. For a moment his will was heavy, a lump of lead.\r\n\r\n\"'Ere it is,\" said the little ferret-faced man, and stooped to pick up a\r\ncindery cube. He looked at Denton, then at the others.\r\n\r\nSlowly, unwillingly, Denton stood up.\r\n\r\nA dirty-faced albino extended a hand to the ferret-faced man. \"Gimme\r\nthat toke,\" he said. He advanced threateningly, bread in hand, to\r\nDenton. \"So you ain't 'ad your bellyful yet,\" he said. \"Eh?\"\r\n\r\nNow it was coming. \"No, I haven't,\" said Denton, with a catching of the\r\nbreath, and resolved to try this brute behind the ear before he himself\r\ngot stunned again. He knew he would be stunned again. He was astonished\r\nhow ill he had judged himself beforehand. A few ridiculous lunges, and\r\ndown he would go again. He watched the albino's eyes. The albino was\r\ngrinning confidently, like a man who plans an agreeable trick. A sudden\r\nperception of impending indignities stung Denton.\r\n\r\n\"You leave 'im alone, Jim,\" said the swart man suddenly over the\r\nblood-stained rag. \"He ain't done nothing to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe albino's grin vanished. He stopped. He looked from one to the other.\r\nIt seemed to Denton that the swart man demanded the privilege of his\r\ndestruction. The albino would have been better.\r\n\r\n\"You leave 'im alone,\" said the swart man. \"See? 'E's 'ad 'is licks.\"\r\n\r\nA clattering bell lifted up its voice and solved the situation. The\r\nalbino hesitated. \"Lucky for you,\" he said, adding a foul metaphor, and\r\nturned with the others towards the press-room again. \"Wait for the end\r\nof the spell, mate,\" said the albino over his shoulder--an afterthought.\r\nThe swart man waited for the albino to precede him. Denton realised that\r\nhe had a reprieve.\r\n\r\nThe men passed towards an open door. Denton became aware of his duties,\r\nand hurried to join the tail of the queue. At the doorway of the vaulted\r\ngallery of presses a yellow-uniformed labour policeman stood ticking a\r\ncard. He had ignored the swart man's hæmorrhage.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up there!\" he said to Denton.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he said, at the sight of his facial disarray. \"Who's been\r\nhitting _you_?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my affair,\" said Denton.\r\n\r\n\"Not if it spiles your work, it ain't,\" said the man in yellow. \"You\r\nmind that.\"\r\n\r\nDenton made no answer. He was a rough--a labourer. He wore the blue\r\ncanvas. The laws of assault and battery, he knew, were not for the\r\nlikes of him. He went to his press.\r\n\r\nHe could feel the skin of his brow and chin and head lifting themselves\r\nto noble bruises, felt the throb and pain of each aspiring contusion.\r\nHis nervous system slid down to lethargy; at each movement in his press\r\nadjustment he felt he lifted a weight. And as for his honour--that too\r\nthrobbed and puffed. How did he stand? What precisely had happened in\r\nthe last ten minutes? What would happen next? He knew that here was\r\nenormous matter for thought, and he could not think save in disordered\r\nsnatches.\r\n\r\nHis mood was a sort of stagnant astonishment. All his conceptions were\r\noverthrown. He had regarded his security from physical violence as\r\ninherent, as one of the conditions of life. So, indeed, it had been\r\nwhile he wore his middle-class costume, had his middle-class property to\r\nserve for his defence. But who would interfere among Labour roughs\r\nfighting together? And indeed in those days no man would. In the\r\nUnderworld there was no law between man and man; the law and machinery\r\nof the state had become for them something that held men down, fended\r\nthem off from much desirable property and pleasure, and that was all.\r\nViolence, that ocean in which the brutes live for ever, and from which a\r\nthousand dykes and contrivances have won our hazardous civilised life,\r\nhad flowed in again upon the sinking underways and submerged them. The\r\nfist ruled. Denton had come right down at last to the elemental--fist\r\nand trick and the stubborn heart and fellowship--even as it was in the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe rhythm of his machine changed, and his thoughts were interrupted.\r\n\r\nPresently he could think again. Strange how quickly things had happened!\r\nHe bore these men who had thrashed him no very vivid ill-will. He was\r\nbruised and enlightened. He saw with absolute fairness now the\r\nreasonableness of his unpopularity. He had behaved like a fool. Disdain,\r\nseclusion, are the privilege of the strong. The fallen aristocrat still\r\nclinging to his pointless distinction is surely the most pitiful\r\ncreature of pretence in all this clamant universe. Good heavens! what\r\nwas there for him to despise in these men?\r\n\r\nWhat a pity he had not appreciated all this better five hours ago!\r\n\r\nWhat would happen at the end of the spell? He could not tell. He could\r\nnot imagine. He could not imagine the thoughts of these men. He was\r\nsensible only of their hostility and utter want of sympathy. Vague\r\npossibilities of shame and violence chased one another across his mind.\r\nCould he devise some weapon? He recalled his assault upon the hypnotist,\r\nbut there were no detachable lamps here. He could see nothing that he\r\ncould catch up in his defence.\r\n\r\nFor a space he thought of a headlong bolt for the security of the public\r\nways directly the spell was over. Apart from the trivial consideration\r\nof his self-respect, he perceived that this would be only a foolish\r\npostponement and aggravation of his trouble. He perceived the\r\nferret-faced man and the albino talking together with their eyes towards\r\nhim. Presently they were talking to the swart man, who stood with his\r\nbroad back studiously towards Denton.\r\n\r\nAt last came the end of the second spell. The lender of oil cans stopped\r\nhis press sharply and turned round, wiping his mouth with the back of\r\nhis hand. His eyes had the quiet expectation of one who seats himself in\r\na theatre.\r\n\r\nNow was the crisis, and all the little nerves of Denton's being seemed\r\nleaping and dancing. He had decided to show fight if any fresh indignity\r\nwas offered him. He stopped his press and turned. With an enormous\r\naffectation of ease he walked down the vault and entered the passage of\r\nthe ash pits, only to discover he had left his jacket--which he had\r\ntaken off because of the heat of the vault--beside his press. He walked\r\nback. He met the albino eye to eye.\r\n\r\nHe heard the ferret-faced man in expostulation. \"'E reely ought, eat\r\nit,\" said the ferret-faced man. \"'E did reely.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--you leave 'im alone,\" said the swart man.\r\n\r\nApparently nothing further was to happen to him that day. He passed out\r\nto the passage and staircase that led up to the moving platforms of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nHe emerged on the livid brilliance and streaming movement of the public\r\nstreet. He became acutely aware of his disfigured face, and felt his\r\nswelling bruises with a limp, investigatory hand. He went up to the\r\nswiftest platform, and seated himself on a Labour Company bench.\r\n\r\nHe lapsed into a pensive torpor. The immediate dangers and stresses of\r\nhis position he saw with a sort of static clearness. What would they do\r\nto-morrow? He could not tell. What would Elizabeth think of his\r\nbrutalisation? He could not tell. He was exhausted. He was aroused\r\npresently by a hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\nHe looked up, and saw the swart man seated beside him. He started.\r\nSurely he was safe from violence in the public way!\r\n\r\nThe swart man's face retained no traces of his share in the fight; his\r\nexpression was free from hostility--seemed almost deferential. \"'Scuse\r\nme,\" he said, with a total absence of truculence. Denton realised that\r\nno assault was intended. He stared, awaiting the next development.\r\n\r\nIt was evident the next sentence was premeditated.\r\n\"Whad--I--was--going--to say--was this,\" said the swart man, and sought\r\nthrough a silence for further words.\r\n\r\n\"Whad--I--was--going--to say--was this,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nFinally he abandoned that gambit. \"_You're_ aw right,\" he cried, laying\r\na grimy hand on Denton's grimy sleeve. \"_You're_ aw right. You're a\r\nge'man. Sorry--very sorry. Wanted to tell you that.\"\r\n\r\nDenton realised that there must exist motives beyond a mere impulse to\r\nabominable proceedings in the man. He meditated, and swallowed an\r\nunworthy pride.\r\n\r\n\"I did not mean to be offensive to you,\" he said, \"in refusing that bit\r\nof bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meant it friendly,\" said the swart man, recalling the scene; \"but--in\r\nfront of that blarsted Whitey and his snigger--Well--I _'ad_ to scrap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Denton with sudden fervour: \"I was a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the swart man, with great satisfaction. \"_That's_ aw right.\r\nShake!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Denton shook.\r\n\r\nThe moving platform was rushing by the establishment of a face moulder,\r\nand its lower front was a huge display of mirror, designed to stimulate\r\nthe thirst for more symmetrical features. Denton caught the reflection\r\nof himself and his new friend, enormously twisted and broadened. His own\r\nface was puffed, one-sided, and blood-stained; a grin of idiotic and\r\ninsincere amiability distorted its latitude. A wisp of hair occluded one\r\neye. The trick of the mirror presented the swart man as a gross\r\nexpansion of lip and nostril. They were linked by shaking hands. Then\r\nabruptly this vision passed--to return to memory in the anæmic\r\nmeditations of a waking dawn.\r\n\r\nAs he shook, the swart man made some muddled remark, to the effect that\r\nhe had always known he could get on with a gentleman if one came his\r\nway. He prolonged the shaking until Denton, under the influence of the\r\nmirror, withdrew his hand. The swart man became pensive, spat\r\nimpressively on the platform, and resumed his theme.\r\n\r\n\"Whad I was going to say was this,\" he said; was gravelled, and shook\r\nhis head at his foot.\r\n\r\nDenton became curious. \"Go on,\" he said, attentive.\r\n\r\nThe swart man took the plunge. He grasped Denton's arm, became intimate\r\nin his attitude. \"'Scuse me,\" he said. \"Fact is, you done know _'ow_ to\r\nscrap. Done know _'ow_ to. Why--you done know 'ow to _begin_. You'll get\r\nkilled if you don't mind. 'Ouldin' your 'ands--_There!_\"\r\n\r\nHe reinforced his statement by objurgation, watching the effect of each\r\noath with a wary eye.\r\n\r\n\"F'r instance. You're tall. Long arms. You get a longer reach than any\r\none in the brasted vault. Gobblimey, but I thought I'd got a Tough on.\r\n'Stead of which ... 'Scuse me. I wouldn't have _'it_ you if I'd known.\r\nIt's like fighting sacks. 'Tisn' right. Y'r arms seemed 'ung on 'ooks.\r\nReg'lar--'ung on 'ooks. There!\"\r\n\r\nDenton stared, and then surprised and hurt his battered chin by a sudden\r\nlaugh. Bitter tears came into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe swart man reverted to his formula. He was good enough to say he\r\nliked the look of Denton, thought he had stood up \"amazing plucky. On'y\r\npluck ain't no good--ain't no brasted good--if you don't 'old your\r\n'ands.\r\n\r\n\"Whad I was going to say was this,\" he said. \"Lemme show you 'ow to\r\nscrap. Jest lemme. You're ig'nant, you ain't no class; but you might be\r\na very decent scrapper--very decent. Shown. That's what I meant to say.\"\r\n\r\nDenton hesitated. \"But--\" he said, \"I can't give you anything--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the ge'man all over,\" said the swart man. \"Who arst you to?\"\r\n\r\n\"But your time?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't get learnt scrapping you'll get killed,--don't you make no\r\nbones of that.\"\r\n\r\nDenton thought. \"I don't know,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the face beside him, and all its native coarseness shouted\r\nat him. He felt a quick revulsion from his transient friendliness. It\r\nseemed to him incredible that it should be necessary for him to be\r\nindebted to such a creature.\r\n\r\n\"The chaps are always scrapping,\" said the swart man. \"Always. And, of\r\ncourse--if one gets waxy and 'its you vital ...\"\r\n\r\n\"By God!\" cried Denton; \"I wish one would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if you feel like that--\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"P'raps I don't,\" said the swart man; and lapsed into a fuming silence.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke again his voice was less friendly, and he prodded Denton\r\nby way of address. \"Look see!\" he said: \"are you going to let me show\r\nyou 'ow to scrap?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's tremendously kind of you,\" said Denton; \"but--\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The swart man rose and bent over Denton.\r\n\r\n\"Too much ge'man,\" he said--\"eh? I got a red face.... By gosh! you\r\nare--you _are_ a brasted fool!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned away, and instantly Denton realised the truth of this remark.\r\n\r\nThe swart man descended with dignity to a cross way, and Denton, after a\r\nmomentary impulse to pursuit, remained on the platform. For a time the\r\nthings that had happened filled his mind. In one day his graceful system\r\nof resignation had been shattered beyond hope. Brute force, the final,\r\nthe fundamental, had thrust its face through all his explanations and\r\nglosses and consolations and grinned enigmatically. Though he was\r\nhungry and tired, he did not go on directly to the Labour Hotel, where\r\nhe would meet Elizabeth. He found he was beginning to think, he wanted\r\nvery greatly to think; and so, wrapped in a monstrous cloud of\r\nmeditation, he went the circuit of the city on his moving platform\r\ntwice. You figure him, tearing through the glaring, thunder-voiced city\r\nat a pace of fifty miles an hour, the city upon the planet that spins\r\nalong its chartless path through space many thousands of miles an hour,\r\nfunking most terribly, and trying to understand why the heart and will\r\nin him should suffer and keep alive.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he came to Elizabeth, she was white and anxious. He might\r\nhave noted she was in trouble, had it not been for his own\r\npreoccupation. He feared most that she would desire to know every detail\r\nof his indignities, that she would be sympathetic or indignant. He saw\r\nher eyebrows rise at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n\"I've had rough handling,\" he said, and gasped. \"It's too fresh--too\r\nhot. I don't want to talk about it.\" He sat down with an unavoidable air\r\nof sullenness.\r\n\r\nShe stared at him in astonishment, and as she read something of the\r\nsignificant hieroglyphic of his battered face, her lips whitened. Her\r\nhand--it was thinner now than in the days of their prosperity, and her\r\nfirst finger was a little altered by the metal punching she\r\ndid--clenched convulsively. \"This horrible world!\" she said, and said no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn these latter days they had become a very silent couple; they said\r\nscarcely a word to each other that night, but each followed a private\r\ntrain of thought. In the small hours, as Elizabeth lay awake, Denton\r\nstarted up beside her suddenly--he had been lying as still as a dead\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot stand it!\" cried Denton. \"I _will_ not stand it!\"\r\n\r\nShe saw him dimly, sitting up; saw his arm lunge as if in a furious blow\r\nat the enshrouding night. Then for a space he was still.\r\n\r\n\"It is too much--it is more than one can bear!\"\r\n\r\nShe could say nothing. To her, also, it seemed that this was as far as\r\none could go. She waited through a long stillness. She could see that\r\nDenton sat with his arms about his knees, his chin almost touching them.\r\n\r\nThen he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said at last, \"I'm going to stand it. That's the peculiar\r\nthing. There isn't a grain of suicide in us--not a grain. I suppose all\r\nthe people with a turn that way have gone. We're going through with\r\nit--to the end.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth thought grayly, and realised that this also was true.\r\n\r\n\"We're going through with it. To think of all who have gone through with\r\nit: all the generations--endless--endless. Little beasts that snapped\r\nand snarled, snapping and snarling, snapping and snarling, generation\r\nafter generation.\"\r\n\r\nHis monotone, ended abruptly, resumed after a vast interval.\r\n\r\n\"There were ninety thousand years of stone age. A Denton somewhere in\r\nall those years. Apostolic succession. The grace of going through. Let\r\nme see! Ninety--nine hundred--three nines, twenty-seven--_three\r\nthousand_ generations of men!--men more or less. And each fought, and\r\nwas bruised, and shamed, and somehow held his own--going through with\r\nit--passing it on.... And thousands more to come perhaps--thousands!\r\n\r\n\"Passing it on. I wonder if they will thank us.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice assumed an argumentative note. \"If one could find something\r\ndefinite ... If one could say, 'This is why--this is why it goes\r\non....'\"\r\n\r\nHe became still, and Elizabeth's eyes slowly separated him from the\r\ndarkness until at last she could see how he sat with his head resting on\r\nhis hand. A sense of the enormous remoteness of their minds came to her;\r\nthat dim suggestion of another being seemed to her a figure of their\r\nmutual understanding. What could he be thinking now? What might he not\r\nsay next? Another age seemed to elapse before he sighed and whispered:\r\n\"No. I don't understand it. No!\" Then a long interval, and he repeated\r\nthis. But the second time it had the tone almost of a solution.\r\n\r\nShe became aware that he was preparing to lie down. She marked his\r\nmovements, perceived with astonishment how he adjusted his pillow with a\r\ncareful regard to comfort. He lay down with a sigh of contentment\r\nalmost. His passion had passed. He lay still, and presently his\r\nbreathing became regular and deep.\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth remained with eyes wide open in the darkness, until the\r\nclamour of a bell and the sudden brilliance of the electric light warned\r\nthem that the Labour Company had need of them for yet another day.\r\n\r\nThat day came a scuffle with the albino Whitey and the little\r\nferret-faced man. Blunt, the swart artist in scrapping, having first\r\nlet Denton grasp the bearing of his lesson, intervened, not without a\r\ncertain quality of patronage. \"Drop 'is 'air, Whitey, and let the man\r\nbe,\" said his gross voice through a shower of indignities. \"Can't you\r\nsee 'e don't know _'ow_ to scrap?\" And Denton, lying shamefully in the\r\ndust, realised that he must accept that course of instruction after all.\r\n\r\nHe made his apology straight and clean. He scrambled up and walked to\r\nBlunt. \"I was a fool, and you are right,\" he said. \"If it isn't too\r\nlate ...\"\r\n\r\nThat night, after the second spell, Denton went with Blunt to certain\r\nwaste and slime-soaked vaults under the Port of London, to learn the\r\nfirst beginnings of the high art of scrapping as it had been perfected\r\nin the great world of the underways: how to hit or kick a man so as to\r\nhurt him excruciatingly or make him violently sick, how to hit or kick\r\n\"vital,\" how to use glass in one's garments as a club and to spread red\r\nruin with various domestic implements, how to anticipate and demolish\r\nyour adversary's intentions in other directions; all the pleasant\r\ndevices, in fact, that had grown up among the disinherited of the great\r\ncities of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, were spread out by a\r\ngifted exponent for Denton's learning. Blunt's bashfulness fell from\r\nhim as the instruction proceeded, and he developed a certain expert\r\ndignity, a quality of fatherly consideration. He treated Denton with the\r\nutmost consideration, only \"flicking him up a bit\" now and then, to keep\r\nthe interest hot, and roaring with laughter at a happy fluke of Denton's\r\nthat covered his mouth with blood.\r\n\r\n\"I'm always keerless of my mouth,\" said Blunt, admitting a weakness.\r\n\"Always. It don't seem to matter, like, just getting bashed in the\r\nmouth--not if your chin's all right. Tastin' blood does me good. Always.\r\nBut I better not 'it you again.\"\r\n\r\nDenton went home, to fall asleep exhausted and wake in the small hours\r\nwith aching limbs and all his bruises tingling. Was it worth while that\r\nhe should go on living? He listened to Elizabeth's breathing, and\r\nremembering that he must have awaked her the previous night, he lay very\r\nstill. He was sick with infinite disgust at the new conditions of his\r\nlife. He hated it all, hated even the genial savage who had protected\r\nhim so generously. The monstrous fraud of civilisation glared stark\r\nbefore his eyes; he saw it as a vast lunatic growth, producing a\r\ndeepening torrent of savagery below, and above ever more flimsy\r\ngentility and silly wastefulness. He could see no redeeming reason, no\r\ntouch of honour, either in the life he had led or in this life to which\r\nhe had fallen. Civilisation presented itself as some catastrophic\r\nproduct as little concerned with men--save as victims--as a cyclone or a\r\nplanetary collision. He, and therefore all mankind, seemed living\r\nutterly in vain. His mind sought some strange expedients of escape, if\r\nnot for himself then at least for Elizabeth. But he meant them for\r\nhimself. What if he hunted up Mwres and told him of their disaster? It\r\ncame to him as an astonishing thing how utterly Mwres and Bindon had\r\npassed out of his range. Where were they? What were they doing? From\r\nthat he passed to thoughts of utter dishonour. And finally, not arising\r\nin any way out of this mental tumult, but ending it as dawn ends the\r\nnight, came the clear and obvious conclusion of the night before: the\r\nconviction that he had to go through with things; that, apart from any\r\nremoter view and quite sufficient for all his thought and energy, he had\r\nto stand up and fight among his fellows and quit himself like a man.\r\n\r\nThe second night's instruction was perhaps less dreadful than the first;\r\nand the third was even endurable, for Blunt dealt out some praise. The\r\nfourth day Denton chanced upon the fact that the ferret-faced man was a\r\ncoward. There passed a fortnight of smouldering days and feverish\r\ninstruction at night; Blunt, with many blasphemies, testified that never\r\nhad he met so apt a pupil; and all night long Denton dreamt of kicks and\r\ncounters and gouges and cunning tricks. For all that time no further\r\noutrages were attempted, for fear of Blunt; and then came the second\r\ncrisis. Blunt did not come one day--afterwards he admitted his\r\ndeliberate intention--and through the tedious morning Whitey awaited the\r\ninterval between the spells with an ostentatious impatience. He knew\r\nnothing of the scrapping lessons, and he spent the time in telling\r\nDenton and the vault generally of certain disagreeable proceedings he\r\nhad in mind.\r\n\r\nWhitey was not popular, and the vault disgorged to see him haze the new\r\nman with only a languid interest. But matters changed when Whitey's\r\nattempt to open the proceedings by kicking Denton in the face was met by\r\nan excellently executed duck, catch and throw, that completed the flight\r\nof Whitey's foot in its orbit and brought Whitey's head into the\r\nash-heap that had once received Denton's. Whitey arose a shade whiter,\r\nand now blasphemously bent upon vital injuries. There were indecisive\r\npassages, foiled enterprises that deepened Whitey's evidently growing\r\nperplexity; and then things developed into a grouping of Denton\r\nuppermost with Whitey's throat in his hand, his knee on Whitey's chest,\r\nand a tearful Whitey with a black face, protruding tongue and broken\r\nfinger endeavouring to explain the misunderstanding by means of hoarse\r\nsounds. Moreover, it was evident that among the bystanders there had\r\nnever been a more popular person than Denton.\r\n\r\nDenton, with proper precaution, released his antagonist and stood up.\r\nHis blood seemed changed to some sort of fluid fire, his limbs felt\r\nlight and supernaturally strong. The idea that he was a martyr in the\r\ncivilisation machine had vanished from his mind. He was a man in a world\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nThe little ferret-faced man was the first in the competition to pat him\r\non the back. The lender of oil cans was a radiant sun of genial\r\ncongratulation.... It seemed incredible to Denton that he had ever\r\nthought of despair.\r\n\r\nDenton was convinced that not only had he to go through with things, but\r\nthat he could. He sat on the canvas pallet expounding this new aspect to\r\nElizabeth. One side of his face was bruised. She had not recently\r\nfought, she had not been patted on the back, there were no hot bruises\r\nupon her face, only a pallor and a new line or so about the mouth. She\r\nwas taking the woman's share. She looked steadfastly at Denton in his\r\nnew mood of prophecy. \"I feel that there is something,\" he was saying,\r\n\"something that goes on, a Being of Life in which we live and move and\r\nhave our being, something that began fifty--a hundred million years ago,\r\nperhaps, that goes on--on: growing, spreading, to things beyond\r\nus--things that will justify us all.... That will explain and justify my\r\nfighting--these bruises, and all the pain of it. It's the chisel--yes,\r\nthe chisel of the Maker. If only I could make you feel as I feel, if I\r\ncould make you! You _will_, dear, I know you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said in a low voice. \"No, I shall not.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I might have thought--\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"No,\" she said, \"I have thought as well. What you\r\nsay--doesn't convince me.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at his face resolutely. \"I hate it,\" she said, and caught at\r\nher breath. \"You do not understand, you do not think. There was a time\r\nwhen you said things and I believed them. I am growing wiser. You are a\r\nman, you can fight, force your way. You do not mind bruises. You can be\r\ncoarse and ugly, and still a man. Yes--it makes you. It makes you. You\r\nare right. Only a woman is not like that. We are different. We have let\r\nourselves get civilised too soon. This underworld is not for us.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused and began again.\r\n\r\n\"I hate it! I hate this horrible canvas! I hate it more than--more than\r\nthe worst that can happen. It hurts my fingers to touch it. It is\r\nhorrible to the skin. And the women I work with day after day! I lie\r\nawake at nights and think how I may be growing like them....\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped. \"I _am_ growing like them,\" she cried passionately.\r\n\r\nDenton stared at her distress. \"But--\" he said and stopped.\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand. What have I? What have I to save me? _You_ can\r\nfight. Fighting is man's work. But women--women are different.... I have\r\nthought it all out, I have done nothing but think night and day. Look at\r\nthe colour of my face! I cannot go on. I cannot endure this life.... I\r\ncannot endure it.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped. She hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"You do not know all,\" she said abruptly, and for an instant her lips\r\nhad a bitter smile. \"I have been asked to leave you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me!\"\r\n\r\nShe made no answer save an affirmative movement of the head.\r\n\r\nDenton stood up sharply. They stared at one another through a long\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she turned herself about, and flung face downward upon their\r\ncanvas bed. She did not sob, she made no sound. She lay still upon her\r\nface. After a vast, distressful void her shoulders heaved and she began\r\nto weep silently.\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth!\" he whispered--\"Elizabeth!\"\r\n\r\nVery softly he sat down beside her, bent down, put his arm across her in\r\na doubtful caress, seeking vainly for some clue to this intolerable\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth,\" he whispered in her ear.\r\n\r\nShe thrust him from her with her hand. \"I cannot bear a child to be a\r\nslave!\" and broke out into loud and bitter weeping.\r\n\r\nDenton's face changed--became blank dismay. Presently he slipped from\r\nthe bed and stood on his feet. All the complacency had vanished from his\r\nface, had given place to impotent rage. He began to rave and curse at\r\nthe intolerable forces which pressed upon him, at all the accidents and\r\nhot desires and heedlessness that mock the life of man. His little voice\r\nrose in that little room, and he shook his fist, this animalcule of the\r\nearth, at all that environed him about, at the millions about him, at\r\nhis past and future and all the insensate vastness of the overwhelming\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\nV--BINDON INTERVENES\r\n\r\nIn Bindon's younger days he had dabbled in speculation and made three\r\nbrilliant flukes. For the rest of his life he had the wisdom to let\r\ngambling alone, and the conceit to believe himself a very clever man. A\r\ncertain desire for influence and reputation interested him in the\r\nbusiness intrigues of the giant city in which his flukes were made. He\r\nbecame at last one of the most influential shareholders in the company\r\nthat owned the London flying stages to which the aëroplanes came from\r\nall parts of the world. This much for his public activities. In his\r\nprivate life he was a man of pleasure. And this is the story of his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBut before proceeding to such depths, one must devote a little time to\r\nthe exterior of this person. Its physical basis was slender, and short,\r\nand dark; and the face, which was fine-featured and assisted by\r\npigments, varied from an insecure self-complacency to an intelligent\r\nuneasiness. His face and head had been depilated, according to the\r\ncleanly and hygienic fashion of the time, so that the colour and contour\r\nof his hair varied with his costume. This he was constantly changing.\r\n\r\nAt times he would distend himself with pneumatic vestments in the rococo\r\nvein. From among the billowy developments of this style, and beneath a\r\ntranslucent and illuminated headdress, his eye watched jealously for the\r\nrespect of the less fashionable world. At other times he emphasised his\r\nelegant slenderness in close-fitting garments of black satin. For\r\neffects of dignity he would assume broad pneumatic shoulders, from which\r\nhung a robe of carefully arranged folds of China silk, and a classical\r\nBindon in pink tights was also a transient phenomenon in the eternal\r\npageant of Destiny. In the days when he hoped to marry Elizabeth, he\r\nsought to impress and charm her, and at the same time to take off\r\nsomething of his burthen of forty years, by wearing the last fancy of\r\nthe contemporary buck, a costume of elastic material with distensible\r\nwarts and horns, changing in colour as he walked, by an ingenious\r\narrangement of versatile chromatophores. And no doubt, if Elizabeth's\r\naffection had not been already engaged by the worthless Denton, and if\r\nher tastes had not had that odd bias for old-fashioned ways, this\r\nextremely _chic_ conception would have ravished her. Bindon had\r\nconsulted Elizabeth's father before presenting himself in this garb--he\r\nwas one of those men who always invite criticism of their costume--and\r\nMwres had pronounced him all that the heart of woman could desire. But\r\nthe affair of the hypnotist proved that his knowledge of the heart of\r\nwoman was incomplete.\r\n\r\nBindon's idea of marrying had been formed some little time before Mwres\r\nthrew Elizabeth's budding womanhood in his way. It was one of Bindon's\r\nmost cherished secrets that he had a considerable capacity for a pure\r\nand simple life of a grossly sentimental type. The thought imparted a\r\nsort of pathetic seriousness to the offensive and quite inconsequent and\r\nunmeaning excesses, which he was pleased to regard as dashing\r\nwickedness, and which a number of good people also were so unwise as to\r\ntreat in that desirable manner. As a consequence of these excesses, and\r\nperhaps by reason also of an inherited tendency to early decay, his\r\nliver became seriously affected, and he suffered increasing\r\ninconvenience when travelling by aëroplane. It was during his\r\nconvalescence from a protracted bilious attack that it occurred to him\r\nthat in spite of all the terrible fascinations of Vice, if he found a\r\nbeautiful, gentle, good young woman of a not too violently intellectual\r\ntype to devote her life to him, he might yet be saved to Goodness, and\r\neven rear a spirited family in his likeness to solace his declining\r\nyears. But like so many experienced men of the world, he doubted if\r\nthere were any good women. Of such as he had heard tell he was outwardly\r\nsceptical and privately much afraid.\r\n\r\nWhen the aspiring Mwres effected his introduction to Elizabeth, it\r\nseemed to him that his good fortune was complete. He fell in love with\r\nher at once. Of course, he had always been falling in love since he was\r\nsixteen, in accordance with the extremely varied recipes to be found in\r\nthe accumulated literature of many centuries. But this was different.\r\nThis was real love. It seemed to him to call forth all the lurking\r\ngoodness in his nature. He felt that for her sake he could give up a way\r\nof life that had already produced the gravest lesions on his liver and\r\nnervous system. His imagination presented him with idyllic pictures of\r\nthe life of the reformed rake. He would never be sentimental with her,\r\nor silly; but always a little cynical and bitter, as became the past.\r\nYet he was sure she would have an intuition of his real greatness and\r\ngoodness. And in due course he would confess things to her, pour his\r\nversion of what he regarded as his wickedness--showing what a complex of\r\nGoethe, and Benvenuto Cellini, and Shelley, and all those other chaps he\r\nreally was--into her shocked, very beautiful, and no doubt sympathetic\r\near. And preparatory to these things he wooed her with infinite subtlety\r\nand respect. And the reserve with which Elizabeth treated him seemed\r\nnothing more nor less than an exquisite modesty touched and enhanced by\r\nan equally exquisite lack of ideas.\r\n\r\nBindon knew nothing of her wandering affections, nor of the attempt made\r\nby Mwres to utilise hypnotism as a corrective to this digression of her\r\nheart; he conceived he was on the best of terms with Elizabeth, and had\r\nmade her quite successfully various significant presents of jewellery\r\nand the more virtuous cosmetics, when her elopement with Denton threw\r\nthe world out of gear for him. His first aspect of the matter was rage\r\nbegotten of wounded vanity, and as Mwres was the most convenient person,\r\nhe vented the first brunt of it upon him.\r\n\r\nHe went immediately and insulted the desolate father grossly, and then\r\nspent an active and determined day going to and fro about the city and\r\ninterviewing people in a consistent and partly-successful attempt to\r\nruin that matrimonial speculator. The effectual nature of these\r\nactivities gave him a temporary exhilaration, and he went to the\r\ndining-place he had frequented in his wicked days in a devil-may-care\r\nframe of mind, and dined altogether too amply and cheerfully with two\r\nother golden youths in their early forties. He threw up the game; no\r\nwoman was worth being good for, and he astonished even himself by the\r\nstrain of witty cynicism he developed. One of the other desperate\r\nblades, warmed with wine, made a facetious allusion to his\r\ndisappointment, but at the time this did not seem unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThe next morning found his liver and temper inflamed. He kicked his\r\nphonographic-news machine to pieces, dismissed his valet, and resolved\r\nthat he would perpetrate a terrible revenge upon Elizabeth. Or Denton.\r\nOr somebody. But anyhow, it was to be a terrible revenge; and the friend\r\nwho had made fun at him should no longer see him in the light of a\r\nfoolish girl's victim. He knew something of the little property that was\r\ndue to her, and that this would be the only support of the young couple\r\nuntil Mwres should relent. If Mwres did not relent, and if unpropitious\r\nthings should happen to the affair in which Elizabeth's expectations\r\nlay, they would come upon evil times and be sufficiently amenable to\r\ntemptation of a sinister sort. Bindon's imagination, abandoning its\r\nbeautiful idealism altogether, expanded the idea of temptation of a\r\nsinister sort. He figured himself as the implacable, the intricate and\r\npowerful man of wealth pursuing this maiden who had scorned him. And\r\nsuddenly her image came upon his mind vivid and dominant, and for the\r\nfirst time in his life Bindon realised something of the real power of\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nHis imagination stood aside like a respectful footman who has done his\r\nwork in ushering in the emotion.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" cried Bindon: \"I will have her! If I have to kill myself to\r\nget her! And that other fellow--!\"\r\n\r\nAfter an interview with his medical man and a penance for his overnight\r\nexcesses in the form of bitter drugs, a mitigated but absolutely\r\nresolute Bindon sought out Mwres. Mwres he found properly smashed, and\r\nimpoverished and humble, in a mood of frantic self-preservation, ready\r\nto sell himself body and soul, much more any interest in a disobedient\r\ndaughter, to recover his lost position in the world. In the reasonable\r\ndiscussion that followed, it was agreed that these misguided young\r\npeople should be left to sink into distress, or possibly even assisted\r\ntowards that improving discipline by Bindon's financial influence.\r\n\r\n\"And then?\" said Mwres.\r\n\r\n\"They will come to the Labour Company,\" said Bindon. \"They will wear the\r\nblue canvas.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"She will divorce him,\" he said, and sat for a moment intent upon that\r\nprospect. For in those days the austere limitations of divorce of\r\nVictorian times were extraordinarily relaxed, and a couple might\r\nseparate on a hundred different scores.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Bindon astonished himself and Mwres by jumping to his\r\nfeet. \"She _shall_ divorce him!\" he cried. \"I will have it so--I will\r\nwork it so. By God! it shall be so. He shall be disgraced, so that she\r\nmust. He shall be smashed and pulverised.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of smashing and pulverising inflamed him further. He began a\r\nJovian pacing up and down the little office. \"I will have her,\" he\r\ncried. \"I _will_ have her! Heaven and Hell shall not save her from me!\"\r\nHis passion evaporated in its expression, and left him at the end\r\nsimply histrionic. He struck an attitude and ignored with heroic\r\ndetermination a sharp twinge of pain about the diaphragm. And Mwres sat\r\nwith his pneumatic cap deflated and himself very visibly impressed.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with a fair persistency, Bindon sat himself to the work of being\r\nElizabeth's malignant providence, using with ingenious dexterity every\r\nparticle of advantage wealth in those days gave a man over his\r\nfellow-creatures. A resort to the consolations of religion hindered\r\nthese operations not at all. He would go and talk with an interesting,\r\nexperienced and sympathetic Father of the Huysmanite sect of the Isis\r\ncult, about all the irrational little proceedings he was pleased to\r\nregard as his heaven-dismaying wickedness, and the interesting,\r\nexperienced and sympathetic Father representing Heaven dismayed, would\r\nwith a pleasing affectation of horror, suggest simple and easy penances,\r\nand recommend a monastic foundation that was airy, cool, hygienic, and\r\nnot vulgarised, for viscerally disordered penitent sinners of the\r\nrefined and wealthy type. And after these excursions, Bindon would come\r\nback to London quite active and passionate again. He would machinate\r\nwith really considerable energy, and repair to a certain gallery high\r\nabove the street of moving ways, from which he could view the entrance\r\nto the barrack of the Labour Company in the ward which sheltered Denton\r\nand Elizabeth. And at last one day he saw Elizabeth go in, and thereby\r\nhis passion was renewed.\r\n\r\nSo in the fullness of time the complicated devices of Bindon ripened,\r\nand he could go to Mwres and tell him that the young people were near\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\"It's time for you,\" he said, \"to let your parental affections have\r\nplay. She's been in blue canvas some months, and they've been cooped\r\ntogether in one of those Labour dens, and the little girl is dead. She\r\nknows now what his manhood is worth to her, by way of protection, poor\r\ngirl. She'll see things now in a clearer light. You go to her--I don't\r\nwant to appear in this affair yet--and point out to her how necessary it\r\nis that she should get a divorce from him....\"\r\n\r\n\"She's obstinate,\" said Mwres doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Spirit!\" said Bindon. \"She's a wonderful girl--a wonderful girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll refuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course she will. But leave it open to her. Leave it open to her. And\r\nsome day--in that stuffy den, in that irksome, toilsome life they can't\r\nhelp it--_they'll have a quarrel_. And then--\"\r\n\r\nMwres meditated over the matter, and did as he was told.\r\n\r\nThen Bindon, as he had arranged with his spiritual adviser, went into\r\nretreat. The retreat of the Huysmanite sect was a beautiful place, with\r\nthe sweetest air in London, lit by natural sunlight, and with restful\r\nquadrangles of real grass open to the sky, where at the same time the\r\npenitent man of pleasure might enjoy all the pleasures of loafing and\r\nall the satisfaction of distinguished austerity. And, save for\r\nparticipation in the simple and wholesome dietary of the place and in\r\ncertain magnificent chants, Bindon spent all his time in meditation upon\r\nthe theme of Elizabeth, and the extreme purification his soul had\r\nundergone since he first saw her, and whether he would be able to get a\r\ndispensation to marry her from the experienced and sympathetic Father in\r\nspite of the approaching \"sin\" of her divorce; and then ... Bindon would\r\nlean against a pillar of the quadrangle and lapse into reveries on the\r\nsuperiority of virtuous love to any other form of indulgence. A curious\r\nfeeling in his back and chest that was trying to attract his attention,\r\na disposition to be hot or shiver, a general sense of ill-health and\r\ncutaneous discomfort he did his best to ignore. All that of course\r\nbelonged to the old life that he was shaking off.\r\n\r\nWhen he came out of retreat he went at once to Mwres to ask for news of\r\nElizabeth. Mwres was clearly under the impression that he was an\r\nexemplary father, profoundly touched about the heart by his child's\r\nunhappiness. \"She was pale,\" he said, greatly moved; \"She was pale. When\r\nI asked her to come away and leave him--and be happy--she put her head\r\ndown upon the table\"--Mwres sniffed--\"and cried.\"\r\n\r\nHis agitation was so great that he could say no more.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Bindon, respecting this manly grief. \"Oh!\" said Bindon quite\r\nsuddenly, with his hand to his side.\r\n\r\nMwres looked up sharply out of the pit of his sorrows, startled. \"What's\r\nthe matter?\" he asked, visibly concerned.\r\n\r\n\"A most violent pain. Excuse me! You were telling me about Elizabeth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mwres, after a decent solicitude for Bindon's pain, proceeded with\r\nhis report. It was even unexpectedly hopeful. Elizabeth, in her first\r\nemotion at discovering that her father had not absolutely deserted her,\r\nhad been frank with him about her sorrows and disgusts.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Bindon, magnificently, \"I shall have her yet.\" And then that\r\nnovel pain twitched him for the second time.\r\n\r\nFor these lower pains the priest was comparatively ineffectual,\r\ninclining rather to regard the body and them as mental illusions\r\namenable to contemplation; so Bindon took it to a man of a class he\r\nloathed, a medical man of extraordinary repute and incivility. \"We must\r\ngo all over you,\" said the medical man, and did so with the most\r\ndisgusting frankness. \"Did you ever bring any children into the world?\"\r\nasked this gross materialist among other impertinent questions.\r\n\r\n\"Not that I know of,\" said Bindon, too amazed to stand upon his dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the medical man, and proceeded with his punching and\r\nsounding. Medical science in those days was just reaching the beginnings\r\nof precision. \"You'd better go right away,\" said the medical man, \"and\r\nmake the Euthanasia. The sooner the better.\"\r\n\r\nBindon gasped. He had been trying not to understand the technical\r\nexplanations and anticipations in which the medical man had indulged.\r\n\r\n\"I say!\" he said. \"But do you mean to say ... Your science ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said the medical man. \"A few opiates. The thing is your own\r\ndoing, you know, to a certain extent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was sorely tempted in my youth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not that so much. But you come of a bad stock. Even if you'd have\r\ntaken precautions you'd have had bad times to wind up with. The mistake\r\nwas getting born. The indiscretions of the parents. And you've shirked\r\nexercise, and so forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had no one to advise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Medical men are always willing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a spirited young fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't argue; the mischief's done now. You've lived. We can't start\r\nyou again. You ought never to have started at all. Frankly--the\r\nEuthanasia!\"\r\n\r\nBindon hated him in silence for a space. Every word of this brutal\r\nexpert jarred upon his refinements. He was so gross, so impermeable to\r\nall the subtler issues of being. But it is no good picking a quarrel\r\nwith a doctor. \"My religious beliefs,\" he said, \"I don't approve of\r\nsuicide.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been doing it all your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyhow, I've come to take a serious view of life now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're bound to, if you go on living. You'll hurt. But for practical\r\npurposes it's late. However, if you mean to do that--perhaps I'd better\r\nmix you a little something. You'll hurt a great deal. These little\r\ntwinges ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Twinges!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mere preliminary notices.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long can I go on? I mean, before I hurt--really.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get it hot soon. Perhaps three days.\"\r\n\r\nBindon tried to argue for an extension of time, and in the midst of his\r\npleading gasped, put his hand to his side. Suddenly the extraordinary\r\npathos of his life came to him clear and vivid. \"It's hard,\" he said.\r\n\"It's infernally hard! I've been no man's enemy but my own. I've always\r\ntreated everybody quite fairly.\"\r\n\r\nThe medical man stared at him without any sympathy for some seconds. He\r\nwas reflecting how excellent it was that there were no more Bindons to\r\ncarry on that line of pathos. He felt quite optimistic. Then he turned\r\nto his telephone and ordered up a prescription from the Central\r\nPharmacy.\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a voice behind him. \"By God!\" cried Bindon; \"I'll\r\nhave her yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician stared over his shoulder at Bindon's expression, and then\r\naltered the prescription.\r\n\r\nSo soon as this painful interview was over, Bindon gave way to rage. He\r\nsettled that the medical man was not only an unsympathetic brute and\r\nwanting in the first beginnings of a gentleman, but also highly\r\nincompetent; and he went off to four other practitioners in succession,\r\nwith a view to the establishment of this intuition. But to guard against\r\nsurprises he kept that little prescription in his pocket. With each he\r\nbegan by expressing his grave doubts of the first doctor's intelligence,\r\nhonesty and professional knowledge, and then stated his symptoms,\r\nsuppressing only a few more material facts in each case. These were\r\nalways subsequently elicited by the doctor. In spite of the welcome\r\ndepreciation of another practitioner, none of these eminent specialists\r\nwould give Bindon any hope of eluding the anguish and helplessness that\r\nloomed now close upon him. To the last of them he unburthened his mind\r\nof an accumulated disgust with medical science. \"After centuries and\r\ncenturies,\" he exclaimed hotly; \"and you can do nothing--except admit\r\nyour helplessness. I say, 'save me'--and what do you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it's hard on you,\" said the doctor. \"But you should have taken\r\nprecautions.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was I to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't our place to run after you,\" said the medical man, picking a\r\nthread of cotton from his purple sleeve. \"Why should we save _you_ in\r\nparticular? You see--from one point of view--people with imaginations\r\nand passions like yours have to go--they have to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Die out. It's an eddy.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a young man with a serene face. He smiled at Bindon. \"We get on\r\nwith research, you know; we give advice when people have the sense to\r\nask for it. And we bide our time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bide your time?\"\r\n\r\n\"We hardly know enough yet to take over the management, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"The management?\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be anxious. Science is young yet. It's got to keep on\r\ngrowing for a few generations. We know enough now to know we don't know\r\nenough yet.... But the time is coming, all the same. _You_ won't see the\r\ntime. But, between ourselves, you rich men and party bosses, with your\r\nnatural play of the passions and patriotism and religion and so forth,\r\nhave made rather a mess of things; haven't you? These Underways! And all\r\nthat sort of thing. Some of us have a sort of fancy that in time we may\r\nknow enough to take over a little more than the ventilation and drains.\r\nKnowledge keeps on piling up, you know. It keeps on growing. And there's\r\nnot the slightest hurry for a generation or so. Some day--some day, men\r\nwill live in a different way.\" He looked at Bindon and meditated.\r\n\"There'll be a lot of dying out before that day can come.\"\r\n\r\nBindon attempted to point out to this young man how silly and irrelevant\r\nsuch talk was to a sick man like himself, how impertinent and uncivil it\r\nwas to him, an older man occupying a position in the official world of\r\nextraordinary power and influence. He insisted that a doctor was paid to\r\ncure people--he laid great stress on \"_paid_\"--and had no business to\r\nglance even for a moment at \"those other questions.\" \"But we do,\" said\r\nthe young man, insisting upon facts, and Bindon lost his temper.\r\n\r\nHis indignation carried him home. That these incompetent impostors, who\r\nwere unable to save the life of a really influential man like himself,\r\nshould dream of some day robbing the legitimate property owners of\r\nsocial control, of inflicting one knew not what tyranny upon the world.\r\nCurse science! He fumed over the intolerable prospect for some time, and\r\nthen the pain returned, and he recalled the made-up prescription of the\r\nfirst doctor, still happily in his pocket. He took a dose forthwith.\r\n\r\nIt calmed and soothed him greatly, and he could sit down in his most\r\ncomfortable chair beside his library (of phonographic records), and\r\nthink over the altered aspect of affairs. His indignation passed, his\r\nanger and his passion crumbled under the subtle attack of that\r\nprescription, pathos became his sole ruler. He stared about him, at his\r\nmagnificent and voluptuously appointed apartment, at his statuary and\r\ndiscreetly veiled pictures, and all the evidences of a cultivated and\r\nelegant wickedness; he touched a stud and the sad pipings of Tristan's\r\nshepherd filled the air. His eye wandered from one object to another.\r\nThey were costly and gross and florid--but they were his. They presented\r\nin concrete form his ideals, his conceptions of beauty and desire, his\r\nidea of all that is precious in life. And now--he must leave it all like\r\na common man. He was, he felt, a slender and delicate flame, burning\r\nout. So must all life flame up and pass, he thought. His eyes filled\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\nThen it came into his head that he was alone. Nobody cared for him,\r\nnobody needed him! at any moment he might begin to hurt vividly. He\r\nmight even howl. Nobody would mind. According to all the doctors he\r\nwould have excellent reason for howling in a day or so. It recalled what\r\nhis spiritual adviser had said of the decline of faith and fidelity, the\r\ndegeneration of the age. He beheld himself as a pathetic proof of this;\r\nhe, the subtle, able, important, voluptuous, cynical, complex Bindon,\r\npossibly howling, and not one faithful simple creature in all the world\r\nto howl in sympathy. Not one faithful simple soul was there--no shepherd\r\nto pipe to him! Had all such faithful simple creatures vanished from\r\nthis harsh and urgent earth? He wondered whether the horrid vulgar crowd\r\nthat perpetually went about the city could possibly know what he thought\r\nof them. If they did he felt sure _some_ would try to earn a better\r\nopinion. Surely the world went from bad to worse. It was becoming\r\nimpossible for Bindons. Perhaps some day ... He was quite sure that the\r\none thing he had needed in life was sympathy. For a time he regretted\r\nthat he left no sonnets--no enigmatical pictures or something of that\r\nsort behind him to carry on his being until at last the sympathetic\r\nmind should come....\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible to him that this that came was extinction. Yet his\r\nsympathetic spiritual guide was in this matter annoyingly figurative and\r\nvague. Curse science! It had undermined all faith--all hope. To go out,\r\nto vanish from theatre and street, from office and dining-place, from\r\nthe dear eyes of womankind. And not to be missed! On the whole to leave\r\nthe world happier!\r\n\r\nHe reflected that he had never worn his heart upon his sleeve. Had he\r\nafter all been _too_ unsympathetic? Few people could suspect how subtly\r\nprofound he really was beneath the mask of that cynical gaiety of his.\r\nThey would not understand the loss they had suffered. Elizabeth, for\r\nexample, had not suspected....\r\n\r\nHe had reserved that. His thoughts having come to Elizabeth gravitated\r\nabout her for some time. How _little_ Elizabeth understood him!\r\n\r\nThat thought became intolerable. Before all other things he must set\r\nthat right. He realised that there was still something for him to do in\r\nlife, his struggle against Elizabeth was even yet not over. He could\r\nnever overcome her now, as he had hoped and prayed. But he might still\r\nimpress her!\r\n\r\nFrom that idea he expanded. He might impress her profoundly--he might\r\nimpress her so that she should for evermore regret her treatment of him.\r\nThe thing that she must realise before everything else was his\r\nmagnanimity. His magnanimity! Yes! he had loved her with amazing\r\ngreatness of heart. He had not seen it so clearly before--but of course\r\nhe was going to leave her all his property. He saw it instantly, as a\r\nthing determined and inevitable. She would think how good he was, how\r\nspaciously generous; surrounded by all that makes life tolerable from\r\nhis hand, she would recall with infinite regret her scorn and coldness.\r\nAnd when she sought expression for that regret, she would find that\r\noccasion gone forever, she should be met by a locked door, by a\r\ndisdainful stillness, by a white dead face. He closed his eyes and\r\nremained for a space imagining himself that white dead face.\r\n\r\nFrom that he passed to other aspects of the matter, but his\r\ndetermination was assured. He meditated elaborately before he took\r\naction, for the drug he had taken inclined him to a lethargic and\r\ndignified melancholy. In certain respects he modified details. If he\r\nleft all his property to Elizabeth it would include the voluptuously\r\nappointed room he occupied, and for many reasons he did not care to\r\nleave that to her. On the other hand, it had to be left to some one. In\r\nhis clogged condition this worried him extremely.\r\n\r\nIn the end he decided to leave it to the sympathetic exponent of the\r\nfashionable religious cult, whose conversation had been so pleasing in\r\nthe past. \"_He_ will understand,\" said Bindon with a sentimental sigh.\r\n\"He knows what Evil means--he understands something of the Stupendous\r\nFascination of the Sphinx of Sin. Yes--he will understand.\" By that\r\nphrase it was that Bindon was pleased to dignify certain unhealthy and\r\nundignified departures from sane conduct to which a misguided vanity and\r\nan ill-controlled curiosity had led him. He sat for a space thinking how\r\nvery Hellenic and Italian and Neronic, and all those things, he had\r\nbeen. Even now--might one not try a sonnet? A penetrating voice to echo\r\ndown the ages, sensuous, sinister, and sad. For a space he forgot\r\nElizabeth. In the course of half an hour he spoilt three phonographic\r\ncoils, got a headache, took a second dose to calm himself, and reverted\r\nto magnanimity and his former design.\r\n\r\nAt last he faced the unpalatable problem of Denton. It needed all his\r\nnewborn magnanimity before he could swallow the thought of Denton; but\r\nat last this greatly misunderstood man, assisted by his sedative and the\r\nnear approach of death, effected even that. If he was at all exclusive\r\nabout Denton, if he should display the slightest distrust, if he\r\nattempted any specific exclusion of that young man, she\r\nmight--_misunderstand_. Yes--she should have her Denton still. His\r\nmagnanimity must go even to that. He tried to think only of Elizabeth in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nHe rose with a sigh, and limped across to the telephonic apparatus that\r\ncommunicated with his solicitor. In ten minutes a will duly attested and\r\nwith its proper thumb-mark signature lay in the solicitor's office three\r\nmiles away. And then for a space Bindon sat very still.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he started out of a vague reverie and pressed an investigatory\r\nhand to his side.\r\n\r\nThen he jumped eagerly to his feet and rushed to the telephone. The\r\nEuthanasia Company had rarely been called by a client in a greater\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nSo it came at last that Denton and his Elizabeth, against all hope,\r\nreturned unseparated from the labour servitude to which they had fallen.\r\nElizabeth came out from her cramped subterranean den of metal-beaters\r\nand all the sordid circumstances of blue canvas, as one comes out of a\r\nnightmare. Back towards the sunlight their fortune took them; once the\r\nbequest was known to them, the bare thought of another day's hammering\r\nbecame intolerable. They went up long lifts and stairs to levels that\r\nthey had not seen since the days of their disaster. At first she was\r\nfull of this sensation of escape; even to think of the underways was\r\nintolerable; only after many months could she begin to recall with\r\nsympathy the faded women who were still below there, murmuring scandals\r\nand reminiscences and folly, and tapping away their lives.\r\n\r\nHer choice of the apartments they presently took expressed the vehemence\r\nof her release. They were rooms upon the very verge of the city; they\r\nhad a roof space and a balcony upon the city wall, wide open to the sun\r\nand wind, the country and the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd in that balcony comes the last scene in this story. It was a summer\r\nsunsetting, and the hills of Surrey were very blue and clear. Denton\r\nleant upon the balcony regarding them, and Elizabeth sat by his side.\r\nVery wide and spacious was the view, for their balcony hung five hundred\r\nfeet above the ancient level of the ground. The oblongs of the Food\r\nCompany, broken here and there by the ruins--grotesque little holes and\r\nsheds--of the ancient suburbs, and intersected by shining streams of\r\nsewage, passed at last into a remote diapering at the foot of the\r\ndistant hills. There once had been the squatting-place of the children\r\nof Uya. On those further slopes gaunt machines of unknown import worked\r\nslackly at the end of their spell, and the hill crest was set with\r\nstagnant wind vanes. Along the great south road the Labour Company's\r\nfield workers in huge wheeled mechanical vehicles, were hurrying back to\r\ntheir meals, their last spell finished. And through the air a dozen\r\nlittle private aëroplanes sailed down towards the city. Familiar scene\r\nas it was to the eyes of Denton and Elizabeth, it would have filled the\r\nminds of their ancestors with incredulous amazement. Denton's thoughts\r\nfluttered towards the future in a vain attempt at what that scene might\r\nbe in another two hundred years, and, recoiling, turned towards the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nHe shared something of the growing knowledge of the time; he could\r\npicture the quaint smoke-grimed Victorian city with its narrow little\r\nroads of beaten earth, its wide common-land, ill-organised, ill-built\r\nsuburbs, and irregular enclosures; the old countryside of the Stuart\r\ntimes, with its little villages and its petty London; the England of the\r\nmonasteries, the far older England of the Roman dominion, and then\r\nbefore that a wild country with here and there the huts of some warring\r\ntribe. These huts must have come and gone and come again through a space\r\nof years that made the Roman camp and villa seem but yesterday; and\r\nbefore those years, before even the huts, there had been men in the\r\nvalley. Even then--so recent had it all been when one judged it by the\r\nstandards of geological time--this valley had been here; and those hills\r\nyonder, higher, perhaps, and snow-tipped, had still been yonder hills,\r\nand the Thames had flowed down from the Cotswolds to the sea. But the\r\nmen had been but the shapes of men, creatures of darkness and ignorance,\r\nvictims of beasts and floods, storms and pestilence and incessant\r\nhunger. They had held a precarious foothold amidst bears and lions and\r\nall the monstrous violence of the past. Already some at least of these\r\nenemies were overcome....\r\n\r\nFor a time Denton pursued the thoughts of this spacious vision, trying\r\nin obedience to his instinct to find his place and proportion in the\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\"It has been chance,\" he said, \"it has been luck. We have come through.\r\nIt happens we have come through. Not by any strength of our own....\r\n\r\n\"And yet ... No. I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a long time before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"After all--there is a long time yet. There have scarcely been men for\r\ntwenty thousand years--and there has been life for twenty millions. And\r\nwhat are generations? What are generations? It is enormous, and we are\r\nso little. Yet we know--we feel. We are not dumb atoms, we are part of\r\nit--part of it--to the limits of our strength and will. Even to die is\r\npart of it. Whether we die or live, we are in the making....\r\n\r\n\"As time goes on--_perhaps_--men will be wiser.... Wiser....\r\n\r\n\"Will they ever understand?\"\r\n\r\nHe became silent again. Elizabeth said nothing to these things, but she\r\nregarded his dreaming face with infinite affection. Her mind was not\r\nvery active that evening. A great contentment possessed her. After a\r\ntime she laid a gentle hand on his beside her. He fondled it softly,\r\nstill looking out upon the spacious gold-woven view. So they sat as the\r\nsun went down. Until presently Elizabeth shivered.\r\n\r\nDenton recalled himself abruptly from these spacious issues of his\r\nleisure, and went in to fetch her a shawl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Who Could Work Miracles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES\r\n\r\nA PANTOUM IN PROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the gift was innate. For my own part, I think it\r\ncame to him suddenly. Indeed, until he was thirty he was a sceptic, and\r\ndid not believe in miraculous powers. And here, since it is the most\r\nconvenient place, I must mention that he was a little man, and had eyes\r\nof a hot brown, very erect red hair, a moustache with ends that he\r\ntwisted up, and freckles. His name was George McWhirter Fotheringay--not\r\nthe sort of name by any means to lead to any expectation of\r\nmiracles--and he was clerk at Gomshott's. He was greatly addicted to\r\nassertive argument. It was while he was asserting the impossibility of\r\nmiracles that he had his first intimation of his extraordinary powers.\r\nThis particular argument was being held in the bar of the Long Dragon,\r\nand Toddy Beamish was conducting the opposition by a monotonous but\r\neffective \"So _you_ say,\" that drove Mr. Fotheringay to the very limit\r\nof his patience.\r\n\r\nThere were present, besides these two, a very dusty cyclist, landlord\r\nCox, and Miss Maybridge, the perfectly respectable and rather portly\r\nbarmaid of the Dragon. Miss Maybridge was standing with her back to Mr.\r\nFotheringay, washing glasses; the others were watching him, more or less\r\namused by the present ineffectiveness of the assertive method. Goaded by\r\nthe Torres Vedras tactics of Mr. Beamish, Mr. Fotheringay determined to\r\nmake an unusual rhetorical effort. \"Looky here, Mr. Beamish,\" said Mr.\r\nFotheringay. \"Let us clearly understand what a miracle is. It's\r\nsomething contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of Will,\r\nsomething what couldn't happen without being specially willed.\"\r\n\r\n\"So _you_ say,\" said Mr. Beamish, repulsing him.\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay appealed to the cyclist, who had hitherto been a silent\r\nauditor, and received his assent--given with a hesitating cough and a\r\nglance at Mr. Beamish. The landlord would express no opinion, and Mr.\r\nFotheringay, returning to Mr. Beamish, received the unexpected\r\nconcession of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle.\r\n\r\n\"For instance,\" said Mr. Fotheringay, greatly encouraged. \"Here would be\r\na miracle. That lamp, in the natural course of nature, couldn't burn\r\nlike that upsy-down, could it, Beamish?\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ say it couldn't,\" said Beamish.\r\n\r\n\"And you?\" said Fotheringay. \"You don't mean to say--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Beamish reluctantly. \"No, it couldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"Then here comes someone, as it might\r\nbe me, along here, and stands as it might be here, and says to that\r\nlamp, as I might do, collecting all my will--Turn upsy-down without\r\nbreaking, and go on burning steady, and--Hullo!\"\r\n\r\nIt was enough to make anyone say \"Hullo!\" The impossible, the\r\nincredible, was visible to them all. The lamp hung inverted in the air,\r\nburning quietly with its flame pointing down. It was as solid, as\r\nindisputable as ever a lamp was, the prosaic common lamp of the Long\r\nDragon bar.\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows\r\nof one anticipating a catastrophic smash. The cyclist, who was sitting\r\nnext the lamp, ducked and jumped across the bar. Everybody jumped, more\r\nor less. Miss Maybridge turned and screamed. For nearly three seconds\r\nthe lamp remained still. A faint cry of mental distress came from Mr.\r\nFotheringay. \"I can't keep it up,\" he said, \"any longer.\" He staggered\r\nback, and the inverted lamp suddenly flared, fell against the corner of\r\nthe bar, bounced aside, smashed upon the floor, and went out.\r\n\r\nIt was lucky it had a metal receiver, or the whole place would have been\r\nin a blaze. Mr. Cox was the first to speak, and his remark, shorn of\r\nneedless excrescences, was to the effect that Fotheringay was a fool.\r\nFotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as\r\nthat! He was astonished beyond measure at the thing that had occurred.\r\nThe subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light on the matter so\r\nfar as Fotheringay was concerned; the general opinion not only followed\r\nMr. Cox very closely but very vehemently. Everyone accused Fotheringay\r\nof a silly trick, and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of\r\ncomfort and security. His mind was in a tornado of perplexity, he was\r\nhimself inclined to agree with them, and he made a remarkably\r\nineffectual opposition to the proposal of his departure.\r\n\r\nHe went home flushed and heated, coat-collar crumpled, eyes smarting\r\nand ears red. He watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he\r\npassed it. It was only when he found himself alone in his little\r\nbed-room in Church Row that he was able to grapple seriously with his\r\nmemories of the occurrence, and ask, \"What on earth happened?\"\r\n\r\nHe had removed his coat and boots, and was sitting on the bed with his\r\nhands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the\r\nseventeenth time, \"_I_ didn't want the confounded thing to upset,\" when\r\nit occurred to him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding\r\nwords he had inadvertently willed the thing he said, and that when he\r\nhad seen the lamp in the air he had felt that it depended on him to\r\nmaintain it there without being clear how this was to be done. He had\r\nnot a particularly complex mind, or he might have stuck for a time at\r\nthat \"inadvertently willed,\" embracing, as it does, the abstrusest\r\nproblems of voluntary action; but as it was, the idea came to him with a\r\nquite acceptable haziness. And from that, following, as I must admit, no\r\nclear logical path, he came to the test of experiment.\r\n\r\nHe pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind, though he\r\nfelt he did a foolish thing. \"Be raised up,\" he said. But in a second\r\nthat feeling vanished. The candle was raised, hung in the air one giddy\r\nmoment, and as Mr. Fotheringay gasped, fell with a smash on his\r\ntoilet-table, leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its\r\nwick.\r\n\r\nFor a time Mr. Fotheringay sat in the darkness, perfectly still. \"It did\r\nhappen, after all,\" he said. \"And 'ow _I'm_ to explain it I _don't_\r\nknow.\" He sighed heavily, and began feeling in his pockets for a match.\r\nHe could find none, and he rose and groped about the toilet-table. \"I\r\nwish I had a match,\" he said. He resorted to his coat, and there was\r\nnone there, and then it dawned upon him that miracles were possible even\r\nwith matches. He extended a hand and scowled at it in the dark. \"Let\r\nthere be a match in that hand,\" he said. He felt some light object fall\r\nacross his palm, and his fingers closed upon a match.\r\n\r\nAfter several ineffectual attempts to light this, he discovered it was a\r\nsafety-match. He threw it down, and then it occurred to him that he\r\nmight have willed it lit. He did, and perceived it burning in the midst\r\nof his toilet-table mat. He caught it up hastily, and it went out. His\r\nperception of possibilities enlarged, and he felt for and replaced the\r\ncandle in its candlestick. \"Here! _you_ be lit,\" said Mr. Fotheringay,\r\nand forthwith the candle was flaring, and he saw a little black hole in\r\nthe toilet-cover, with a wisp of smoke rising from it. For a time he\r\nstared from this to the little flame and back, and then looked up and\r\nmet his own gaze in the looking glass. By this help he communed with\r\nhimself in silence for a time.\r\n\r\n\"How about miracles now?\" said Mr. Fotheringay at last, addressing his\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent meditations of Mr. Fotheringay were of a severe but\r\nconfused description. So far, he could see it was a case of pure willing\r\nwith him. The nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any\r\nfurther experiments, at least until he had reconsidered them. But he\r\nlifted a sheet of paper, and turned a glass of water pink and then\r\ngreen, and he created a snail, which he miraculously annihilated, and\r\ngot himself a miraculous new tooth-brush. Somewhen in the small hours he\r\nhad reached the fact that his will-power must be of a particularly rare\r\nand pungent quality, a fact of which he had certainly had inklings\r\nbefore, but no certain assurance. The scare and perplexity of his first\r\ndiscovery was now qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and\r\nby vague intimations of advantage. He became aware that the church clock\r\nwas striking one, and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties\r\nat Gomshott's might be miraculously dispensed with, he resumed\r\nundressing, in order to get to bed without further delay. As he\r\nstruggled to get his shirt over his head, he was struck with a brilliant\r\nidea. \"Let me be in bed,\" he said, and found himself so. \"Undressed,\" he\r\nstipulated; and, finding the sheets cold, added hastily, \"and in my\r\nnightshirt--no, in a nice soft woollen nightshirt. Ah!\" he said with\r\nimmense enjoyment. \"And now let me be comfortably asleep....\"\r\n\r\nHe awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfast-time,\r\nwondering whether his overnight experience might not be a particularly\r\nvivid dream. At length his mind turned again to cautious experiments.\r\nFor instance, he had three eggs for breakfast; two his landlady had\r\nsupplied, good, but shoppy, and one was a delicious fresh goose-egg,\r\nlaid, cooked, and served by his extraordinary will. He hurried off to\r\nGomshott's in a state of profound but carefully concealed excitement,\r\nand only remembered the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke\r\nof it that night. All day he could do no work because of this\r\nastonishingly new self-knowledge, but this caused him no inconvenience,\r\nbecause he made up for it miraculously in his last ten minutes.\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation,\r\nalbeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the Long Dragon were\r\nstill disagreeable to recall, and a garbled account of the matter that\r\nhad reached his colleagues led to some badinage. It was evident he must\r\nbe careful how he lifted frangible articles, but in other ways his gift\r\npromised more and more as he turned it over in his mind. He intended\r\namong other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious\r\nacts of creation. He called into existence a pair of very splendid\r\ndiamond studs, and hastily annihilated them again as young Gomshott came\r\nacross the counting-house to his desk. He was afraid young Gomshott\r\nmight wonder how he had come by them. He saw quite clearly the gift\r\nrequired caution and watchfulness in its exercise, but so far as he\r\ncould judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater\r\nthan those he had already faced in the study of cycling. It was that\r\nanalogy, perhaps, quite as much as the feeling that he would be\r\nunwelcome in the Long Dragon, that drove him out after supper into the\r\nlane beyond the gas-works, to rehearse a few miracles in private.\r\n\r\nThere was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts, for\r\napart from his will-power Mr. Fotheringay was not a very exceptional\r\nman. The miracle of Moses' rod came to his mind, but the night was dark\r\nand unfavourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes. Then\r\nhe recollected the story of \"Tannhäuser\" that he had read on the back of\r\nthe Philharmonic programme. That seemed to him singularly attractive and\r\nharmless. He stuck his walking-stick--a very nice Poona-Penang\r\nlawyer--into the turf that edged the footpath, and commanded the dry\r\nwood to blossom. The air was immediately full of the scent of roses, and\r\nby means of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was\r\nindeed accomplished. His satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps.\r\nAfraid of a premature discovery of his powers, he addressed the\r\nblossoming stick hastily: \"Go back.\" What he meant was \"Change back;\"\r\nbut of course he was confused. The stick receded at a considerable\r\nvelocity, and incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the\r\napproaching person. \"Who are you throwing brambles at, you fool?\" cried\r\na voice. \"That got me on the shin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, old chap,\" said Mr. Fotheringay, and then realising the\r\nawkward nature of the explanation, caught nervously at his moustache.\r\nHe saw Winch, one of the three Immering constables, advancing.\r\n\r\n\"What d'yer mean by it?\" asked the constable. \"Hullo! It's you, is it?\r\nThe gent that broke the lamp at the Long Dragon!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean anything by it,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"Nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"What d'yer do it for then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother!\" said Mr. Fotheringay.\r\n\r\n\"Bother indeed! D'yer know that stick hurt? What d'yer do it for, eh?\"\r\n\r\nFor the moment Mr. Fotheringay could not think what he had done it for.\r\nHis silence seemed to irritate Mr. Winch. \"You've been assaulting the\r\npolice, young man, this time. That's what _you_ done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Mr. Winch,\" said Mr. Fotheringay, annoyed and confused, \"I'm\r\nvery sorry. The fact is----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\nHe could think of no way but the truth. \"I was working a miracle.\" He\r\ntried to speak in an off-hand way, but try as he would he couldn't.\r\n\r\n\"Working a----! 'Ere, don't you talk rot. Working a miracle, indeed!\r\nMiracle! Well, that's downright funny! Why, you's the chap that don't\r\nbelieve in miracles.... Fact is, this is another of your silly conjuring\r\ntricks--that's what this is. Now, I tell you----\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Fotheringay never heard what Mr. Winch was going to tell him. He\r\nrealised he had given himself away, flung his valuable secret to all the\r\nwinds of heaven. A violent gust of irritation swept him to action. He\r\nturned on the constable swiftly and fiercely. \"Here,\" he said, \"I've had\r\nenough of this, I have! I'll show you a silly conjuring trick, I will!\r\nGo to Hades! Go, now!\"\r\n\r\nHe was alone!\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay performed no more miracles that night, nor did he\r\ntrouble to see what had become of his flowering stick. He returned to\r\nthe town, scared and very quiet, and went to his bed-room. \"Lord!\" he\r\nsaid, \"it's a powerful gift--an extremely powerful gift. I didn't hardly\r\nmean as much as that. Not really.... I wonder what Hades is like!\"\r\n\r\nHe sat on the bed taking off his boots. Struck by a happy thought he\r\ntransferred the constable to San Francisco, and without any more\r\ninterference with normal causation went soberly to bed. In the night he\r\ndreamt of the anger of Winch.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Fotheringay heard two interesting items of news.\r\nSomeone had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder Mr.\r\nGomshott's private house in the Lullaborough Road, and the river as far\r\nas Rawling's Mill was to be dragged for Constable Winch.\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day, and\r\nperformed no miracles except certain provisions for Winch, and the\r\nmiracle of completing his day's work with punctual perfection in spite\r\nof all the bee-swarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind. And the\r\nextraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner was remarked by\r\nseveral people, and made a matter for jesting. For the most part he was\r\nthinking of Winch.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday evening he went to chapel, and oddly enough, Mr. Maydig, who\r\ntook a certain interest in occult matters, preached about \"things that\r\nare not lawful.\" Mr. Fotheringay was not a regular chapel goer, but the\r\nsystem of assertive scepticism, to which I have already alluded, was now\r\nvery much shaken. The tenor of the sermon threw an entirely new light on\r\nthese novel gifts, and he suddenly decided to consult Mr. Maydig\r\nimmediately after the service. So soon as that was determined, he found\r\nhimself wondering why he had not done so before.\r\n\r\nMr. Maydig, a lean, excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and\r\nneck, was gratified at a request for a private conversation from a young\r\nman whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for general\r\nremark in the town. After a few necessary delays, he conducted him to\r\nthe study of the Manse, which was contiguous to the chapel, seated him\r\ncomfortably, and, standing in front of a cheerful fire--his legs threw a\r\nRhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wall--requested Mr. Fotheringay\r\nto state his business.\r\n\r\nAt first Mr. Fotheringay was a little abashed, and found some difficulty\r\nin opening the matter. \"You will scarcely believe me, Mr. Maydig, I am\r\nafraid\"--and so forth for some time. He tried a question at last, and\r\nasked Mr. Maydig his opinion of miracles.\r\n\r\nMr. Maydig was still saying \"Well\" in an extremely judicial tone, when\r\nMr. Fotheringay interrupted again: \"You don't believe, I suppose, that\r\nsome common sort of person--like myself, for instance--as it might be\r\nsitting here now, might have some sort of twist inside him that made him\r\nable to do things by his will.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's possible,\" said Mr. Maydig. \"Something of the sort, perhaps, is\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I might make free with something here, I think I might show you by a\r\nsort of experiment,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"Now, take that tobacco-jar\r\non the table, for instance. What I want to know is whether what I am\r\ngoing to do with it is a miracle or not. Just half a minute, Mr. Maydig,\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nHe knitted his brows, pointed to the tobacco-jar and said: \"Be a bowl of\r\nvi'lets.\"\r\n\r\nThe tobacco-jar did as it was ordered.\r\n\r\nMr. Maydig started violently at the change, and stood looking from the\r\nthaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers. He said nothing. Presently he\r\nventured to lean over the table and smell the violets; they were\r\nfresh-picked and very fine ones. Then he stared at Mr. Fotheringay\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"How did you do that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay pulled his moustache. \"Just told it--and there you are.\r\nIs that a miracle, or is it black art, or what is it? And what do you\r\nthink's the matter with me? That's what I want to ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a most extraordinary occurrence.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this day last week I knew no more that I could do things like that\r\nthan you did. It came quite sudden. It's something odd about my will, I\r\nsuppose, and that's as far as I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is _that_--the only thing. Could you do other things besides that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, yes!\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"Just anything.\" He thought, and\r\nsuddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen. \"Here!\" He\r\npointed. \"Change into a bowl of fish--no, not that--change into a glass\r\nbowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it. That's better! You see\r\nthat, Mr. Maydig?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's astonishing. It's incredible. You are either a most extraordinary\r\n... But no----\"\r\n\r\n\"I could change it into anything,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"Just anything.\r\nHere! be a pigeon, will you?\"\r\n\r\nIn another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making\r\nMr. Maydig duck every time it came near him. \"Stop there, will you,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Fotheringay; and the pigeon hung motionless in the air. \"I\r\ncould change it back to a bowl of flowers,\" he said, and after replacing\r\nthe pigeon on the table worked that miracle. \"I expect you will want\r\nyour pipe in a bit,\" he said, and restored the tobacco-jar.\r\n\r\nMr. Maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory\r\nsilence. He stared at Mr. Fotheringay and, in a very gingerly manner,\r\npicked up the tobacco-jar, examined it, replaced it on the table.\r\n\"_Well!_\" was the only expression of his feelings.\r\n\r\n\"Now, after that it's easier to explain what I came about,\" said Mr.\r\nFotheringay; and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his\r\nstrange experiences, beginning with the affair of the lamp in the Long\r\nDragon and complicated by persistent allusions to Winch. As he went on,\r\nthe transient pride Mr. Maydig's consternation had caused passed away;\r\nhe became the very ordinary Mr. Fotheringay of everyday intercourse\r\nagain. Mr. Maydig listened intently, the tobacco-jar in his hand, and\r\nhis bearing changed also with the course of the narrative. Presently,\r\nwhile Mr. Fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg, the\r\nminister interrupted with a fluttering extended hand--\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" he said. \"It is credible. It is amazing, of course,\r\nbut it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties. The power to work\r\nmiracles is a gift--a peculiar quality like genius or second\r\nsight--hitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional people. But\r\nin this case ... I have always wondered at the miracles of Mahomet, and\r\nat Yogi's miracles, and the miracles of Madame Blavatsky. But, of\r\ncourse! Yes, it is simply a gift! It carries out so beautifully the\r\narguments of that great thinker\"--Mr. Maydig's voice sank--\"his Grace\r\nthe Duke of Argyll. Here we plumb some profounder law--deeper than the\r\nordinary laws of nature. Yes--yes. Go on. Go on!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with Winch, and\r\nMr. Maydig, no longer overawed or scared, began to jerk his limbs about\r\nand interject astonishment. \"It's this what troubled me most,\" proceeded\r\nMr. Fotheringay; \"it's this I'm most mijitly in want of advice for; of\r\ncourse he's at San Francisco--wherever San Francisco may be--but of\r\ncourse it's awkward for both of us, as you'll see, Mr. Maydig. I don't\r\nsee how he can understand what has happened, and I daresay he's scared\r\nand exasperated something tremendous, and trying to get at me. I daresay\r\nhe keeps on starting off to come here. I send him back, by a miracle,\r\nevery few hours, when I think of it. And of course, that's a thing he\r\nwon't be able to understand, and it's bound to annoy him; and, of\r\ncourse, if he takes a ticket every time it will cost him a lot of\r\nmoney. I done the best I could for him, but of course it's difficult for\r\nhim to put himself in my place. I thought afterwards that his clothes\r\nmight have got scorched, you know--if Hades is all it's supposed to\r\nbe--before I shifted him. In that case I suppose they'd have locked him\r\nup in San Francisco. Of course I willed him a new suit of clothes on him\r\ndirectly I thought of it. But, you see, I'm already in a deuce of a\r\ntangle----\"\r\n\r\nMr. Maydig looked serious. \"I see you are in a tangle. Yes, it's a\r\ndifficult position. How you are to end it ...\" He became diffuse and\r\ninconclusive.\r\n\r\n\"However, we'll leave Winch for a little and discuss the larger\r\nquestion. I don't think this is a case of the black art or anything of\r\nthe sort. I don't think there is any taint of criminality about it at\r\nall, Mr. Fotheringay--none whatever, unless you are suppressing material\r\nfacts. No, it's miracles--pure miracles--miracles, if I may say so, of\r\nthe very highest class.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate, while Mr. Fotheringay\r\nsat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm, looking worried.\r\n\"I don't see how I'm to manage about Winch,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"A gift of working miracles--apparently a very powerful gift,\" said Mr.\r\nMaydig, \"will find a way about Winch--never fear. My dear Sir, you are a\r\nmost important man--a man of the most astonishing possibilities. As\r\nevidence, for example! And in other ways, the things you may do....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _I've_ thought of a thing or two,\" said Mr. Fotheringay.\r\n\"But--some of the things came a bit twisty. You saw that fish at first?\r\nWrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish. And I thought I'd ask\r\nsomeone.\"\r\n\r\n\"A proper course,\" said Mr. Maydig, \"a very proper course--altogether\r\nthe proper course.\" He stopped and looked at Mr. Fotheringay. \"It's\r\npractically an unlimited gift. Let us test your powers, for instance. If\r\nthey really _are_ ... If they really are all they seem to be.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, incredible as it may seem, in the study of the little house\r\nbehind the Congregational Chapel, on the evening of Sunday, Nov. 10,\r\n1896, Mr. Fotheringay, egged on and inspired by Mr. Maydig, began to\r\nwork miracles. The reader's attention is specially and definitely called\r\nto the date. He will object, probably has already objected, that certain\r\npoints in this story are improbable, that if any things of the sort\r\nalready described had indeed occurred, they would have been in all the\r\npapers a year ago. The details immediately following he will find\r\nparticularly hard to accept, because among other things they involve the\r\nconclusion that he or she, the reader in question, must have been killed\r\nin a violent and unprecedented manner more than a year ago. Now a\r\nmiracle is nothing if not improbable, and as a matter of fact the reader\r\n_was_ killed in a violent and unprecedented manner a year ago. In the\r\nsubsequent course of this story that will become perfectly clear and\r\ncredible, as every right-minded and reasonable reader will admit. But\r\nthis is not the place for the end of the story, being but little beyond\r\nthe hither side of the middle. And at first the miracles worked by Mr.\r\nFotheringay were timid little miracles--little things with the cups and\r\nparlour fitments, as feeble as the miracles of Theosophists, and, feeble\r\nas they were, they were received with awe by his collaborator. He would\r\nhave preferred to settle the Winch business out of hand, but Mr. Maydig\r\nwould not let him. But after they had worked a dozen of these domestic\r\ntrivialities, their sense of power grew, their imagination began to show\r\nsigns of stimulation, and their ambition enlarged. Their first larger\r\nenterprise was due to hunger and the negligence of Mrs. Minchin, Mr.\r\nMaydig's housekeeper. The meal to which the minister conducted Mr.\r\nFotheringay was certainly ill-laid and uninviting as refreshment for two\r\nindustrious miracle-workers; but they were seated, and Mr. Maydig was\r\ndescanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon his housekeeper's\r\nshortcomings, before it occurred to Mr. Fotheringay that an opportunity\r\nlay before him. \"Don't you think, Mr. Maydig,\" he said, \"if it isn't a\r\nliberty, _I_----\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Fotheringay! Of course! No--I didn't think.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay waved his hand. \"What shall we have?\" he said, in a\r\nlarge, inclusive spirit, and, at Mr. Maydig's order, revised the supper\r\nvery thoroughly. \"As for me,\" he said, eyeing Mr. Maydig's selection, \"I\r\nam always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice Welsh\r\nrarebit, and I'll order that. I ain't much given to Burgundy,\" and\r\nforthwith stout and Welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command. They\r\nsat long at their supper, talking like equals, as Mr. Fotheringay\r\npresently perceived, with a glow of surprise and gratification, of all\r\nthe miracles they would presently do. \"And, by the bye, Mr. Maydig,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Fotheringay, \"I might perhaps be able to help you--in a\r\ndomestic way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't quite follow,\" said Mr. Maydig pouring out a glass of miraculous\r\nold Burgundy.\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay helped himself to a second Welsh rarebit out of vacancy,\r\nand took a mouthful. \"I was thinking,\" he said, \"I might be able (_chum,\r\nchum_) to work (_chum, chum_) a miracle with Mrs. Minchin (_chum,\r\nchum_)--make her a better woman.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful. \"She's---- She\r\nstrongly objects to interference, you know, Mr. Fotheringay. And--as a\r\nmatter of fact--it's well past eleven and she's probably in bed and\r\nasleep. Do you think, on the whole----\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay considered these objections. \"I don't see that it\r\nshouldn't be done in her sleep.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time Mr. Maydig opposed the idea, and then he yielded. Mr.\r\nFotheringay issued his orders, and a little less at their ease, perhaps,\r\nthe two gentlemen proceeded with their repast. Mr. Maydig was enlarging\r\non the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day, with an\r\noptimism that seemed even to Mr. Fotheringay's supper senses a little\r\nforced and hectic, when a series of confused noises from upstairs began.\r\nTheir eyes exchanged interrogations, and Mr. Maydig left the room\r\nhastily. Mr. Fotheringay heard him calling up to his housekeeper and\r\nthen his footsteps going softly up to her.\r\n\r\nIn a minute or so the minister returned, his step light, his face\r\nradiant. \"Wonderful!\" he said, \"and touching! Most touching!\"\r\n\r\nHe began pacing the hearthrug. \"A repentance--a most touching\r\nrepentance--through the crack of the door. Poor woman! A most wonderful\r\nchange! She had got up. She must have got up at once. She had got up out\r\nof her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box. And to\r\nconfess it too!... But this gives us--it opens--a most amazing vista of\r\npossibilities. If we can work this miraculous change in _her_ ...\"\r\n\r\n\"The thing's unlimited seemingly,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"And about Mr.\r\nWinch--\"\r\n\r\n\"Altogether unlimited.\" And from the hearthrug Mr. Maydig, waving\r\nthe Winch difficulty aside, unfolded a series of wonderful\r\nproposals--proposals he invented as he went along.\r\n\r\nNow what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this\r\nstory. Suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite\r\nbenevolence, the sort of benevolence that used to be called\r\npost-prandial. Suffice it, too, that the problem of Winch remained\r\nunsolved. Nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its\r\nfulfilment. There were astonishing changes. The small hours found Mr.\r\nMaydig and Mr. Fotheringay careering across the chilly market-square\r\nunder the still moon, in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy, Mr. Maydig\r\nall flap and gesture, Mr. Fotheringay short and bristling, and no longer\r\nabashed at his greatness. They had reformed every drunkard in the\r\nParliamentary division, changed all the beer and alcohol to water (Mr.\r\nMaydig had overruled Mr. Fotheringay on this point); they had, further,\r\ngreatly improved the railway communication of the place, drained\r\nFlinder's swamp, improved the soil of One Tree Hill, and cured the\r\nVicar's wart. And they were going to see what could be done with the\r\ninjured pier at South Bridge. \"The place,\" gasped Mr. Maydig, \"won't be\r\nthe same place to-morrow. How surprised and thankful everyone will be!\"\r\nAnd just at that moment the church clock struck three.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Mr. Fotheringay, \"that's three o'clock! I must be getting\r\nback. I've got to be at business by eight. And besides, Mrs. Wimms--\"\r\n\r\n\"We're only beginning,\" said Mr. Maydig, full of the sweetness of\r\nunlimited power. \"We're only beginning. Think of all the good we're\r\ndoing. When people wake--\"\r\n\r\n\"But--,\" said Mr. Fotheringay.\r\n\r\nMr. Maydig gripped his arm suddenly. His eyes were bright and wild. \"My\r\ndear chap,\" he said, \"there's no hurry. Look\"--he pointed to the moon at\r\nthe zenith--\"Joshua!\"\r\n\r\n\"Joshua?\" said Mr. Fotheringay.\r\n\r\n\"Joshua,\" said Mr. Maydig. \"Why not? Stop it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay looked at the moon.\r\n\r\n\"That's a bit tall,\" he said after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said Mr. Maydig. \"Of course it doesn't stop. You stop the\r\nrotation of the earth, you know. Time stops. It isn't as if we were\r\ndoing harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"Well.\" He sighed. \"I'll try. Here--\"\r\n\r\nHe buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe,\r\nwith as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power. \"Jest stop\r\nrotating, will you,\" said Mr. Fotheringay.\r\n\r\nIncontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate\r\nof dozens of miles a minute. In spite of the innumerable circles he was\r\ndescribing per second, he thought; for thought is wonderful--sometimes\r\nas sluggish as flowing pitch, sometimes as instantaneous as light. He\r\nthought in a second, and willed. \"Let me come down safe and sound.\r\nWhatever else happens, let me down safe and sound.\"\r\n\r\nHe willed it only just in time, for his clothes, heated by his rapid\r\nflight through the air, were already beginning to singe. He came down\r\nwith a forcible, but by no means injurious bump in what appeared to be a\r\nmound of fresh-turned earth. A large mass of metal and masonry,\r\nextraordinarily like the clock-tower in the middle of the market-square,\r\nhit the earth near him, ricochetted over him, and flew into stonework,\r\nbricks, and masonry, like a bursting bomb. A hurtling cow hit one of the\r\nlarger blocks and smashed like an egg. There was a crash that made all\r\nthe most violent crashes of his past life seem like the sound of falling\r\ndust, and this was followed by a descending series of lesser crashes. A\r\nvast wind roared throughout earth and heaven, so that he could scarcely\r\nlift his head to look. For a while he was too breathless and astonished\r\neven to see where he was or what had happened. And his first movement\r\nwas to feel his head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was\r\nstill his own.\r\n\r\n\"Lord!\" gasped Mr. Fotheringay, scarce able to speak for the gale, \"I've\r\nhad a squeak! What's gone wrong? Storms and thunder. And only a minute\r\nago a fine night. It's Maydig set me on to this sort of thing. _What_ a\r\nwind! If I go on fooling in this way I'm bound to have a thundering\r\naccident!...\r\n\r\n\"Where's Maydig?\r\n\r\n\"What a confounded mess everything's in!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit. The\r\nappearance of things was really extremely strange. \"The sky's all right\r\nanyhow,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"And that's about all that is all right.\r\nAnd even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up. But there's the\r\nmoon overhead. Just as it was just now. Bright as midday. But as for the\r\nrest--Where's the village? Where's--where's anything? And what on earth\r\nset this wind a-blowing? _I_ didn't order no wind.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain, and after one\r\nfailure, remained on all fours, holding on. He surveyed the moonlit\r\nworld to leeward, with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head.\r\n\"There's something seriously wrong,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"And what it\r\nis--goodness knows.\"\r\n\r\nFar and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of\r\ndust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and\r\nheaps of inchoate ruins, no trees, no houses, no familiar shapes, only a\r\nwilderness of disorder vanishing at last into the darkness beneath the\r\nwhirling columns and streamers, the lightnings and thunderings of a\r\nswiftly rising storm. Near him in the livid glare was something that\r\nmight once have been an elm-tree, a smashed mass of splinters, shivered\r\nfrom boughs to base, and further a twisted mass of iron girders--only\r\ntoo evidently the viaduct--rose out of the piled confusion.\r\n\r\nYou see, when Mr. Fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid\r\nglobe, he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling movables upon\r\nits surface. And the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator\r\nis travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour, and in these\r\nlatitudes at more than half that pace. So that the village, and Mr.\r\nMaydig, and Mr. Fotheringay, and everybody and everything had been\r\njerked violently forward at about nine miles per second--that is to say,\r\nmuch more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon. And\r\nevery human being, every living creature, every house, and every\r\ntree--all the world as we know it--had been so jerked and smashed and\r\nutterly destroyed. That was all.\r\n\r\nThese things Mr. Fotheringay did not, of course, fully appreciate. But\r\nhe perceived that his miracle had miscarried, and with that a great\r\ndisgust of miracles came upon him. He was in darkness now, for the\r\nclouds had swept together and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the\r\nmoon, and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of\r\nhail. A great roaring of wind and waters filled earth and sky, and,\r\npeering under his hand through the dust and sleet to windward, he saw by\r\nthe play of the lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Maydig!\" screamed Mr. Fotheringay's feeble voice amid the elemental\r\nuproar. \"Here!--Maydig!\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried Mr. Fotheringay to the advancing water. \"Oh, for goodness'\r\nsake, stop!\r\n\r\n\"Just a moment,\" said Mr. Fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder.\r\n\"Stop jest a moment while I collect my thoughts.... And now what shall I\r\ndo?\" he said. \"What _shall_ I do? Lord! I wish Maydig was about.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"And for goodness' sake let's have it\r\nright _this_ time.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained on all fours, leaning against the wind, very intent to have\r\neverything right.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"Let nothing what I'm going to order happen until I say\r\n'Off!'.... Lord! I wish I'd thought of that before!\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted his little voice against the whirlwind, shouting louder and\r\nlouder in the vain desire to hear himself speak. \"Now then!--here goes!\r\nMind about that what I said just now. In the first place, when all I've\r\ngot to say is done, let me lose my miraculous power, let my will become\r\njust like anybody else's will, and all these dangerous miracles be\r\nstopped. I don't like them. I'd rather I didn't work 'em. Ever so much.\r\nThat's the first thing. And the second is--let me be back just before\r\nthe miracles begin; let everything be just as it was before that blessed\r\nlamp turned up. It's a big job, but it's the last. Have you got it? No\r\nmore miracles, everything as it was--me back in the Long Dragon just\r\nbefore I drank my half-pint. That's it! Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe dug his fingers into the mould, closed his eyes, and said \"Off!\"\r\n\r\nEverything became perfectly still. He perceived that he was standing\r\nerect.\r\n\r\n\"So _you_ say,\" said a voice.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes. He was in the bar of the Long Dragon, arguing about\r\nmiracles with Toddy Beamish. He had a vague sense of some great thing\r\nforgotten that instantaneously passed. You see that, except for the loss\r\nof his miraculous powers, everything was back as it had been, his mind\r\nand memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when\r\nthis story began. So that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told\r\nhere, knows nothing of all that is told here to this day. And among\r\nother things, of course, he still did not believe in miracles.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you that miracles, properly speaking, can't possibly happen,\" he\r\nsaid, \"whatever you like to hold. And I'm prepared to prove it up to the\r\nhilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what _you_ think,\" said Toddy Beamish, and \"Prove it if you\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Looky here, Mr. Beamish,\" said Mr. Fotheringay. \"Let us clearly\r\nunderstand what a miracle is. It's something contrariwise to the course\r\nof nature done by power of Will....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\n         Edinburgh & London\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         When the\r\n                                 Sleeper Wakes\r\n\r\n                    A Story of the Days to Come. By\r\n                    H. G. WELLS, Author of \"The War\r\n                    of the Worlds,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the Sleeper Wakes,\" by far the longest story Mr. Wells has yet\r\ngiven us, presents a spacious picture of the development of our\r\ncivilisation during the next two hundred years. The sleeper is a typical\r\nliberal-minded man of means of the nineteenth century, and he awakens\r\nfrom a cataleptic trance in the year 2100, to discover that by an ironic\r\ncombination of circumstances he has become the central figure of an\r\nenormous political convulsion. His attempt to rise to the\r\nresponsibilities of his position, his struggle for power--inspired by an\r\nenthusiastic girl--with the great political organiser Ostrog, give the\r\ngreat structural lines of the story.\r\n\r\n    \"He fell to sleep a fanatical democrat--a socialist: he woke a\r\n    tyrant; he died fighting with the people against the tyranny he had\r\n    unconsciously fashioned while he slept. Surely a theme of\r\n    magnificent possibilities--a theme more fertile in romance even than\r\n    the central idea of 'The War of the Worlds.' The discovery of such\r\n    material is in itself no mean triumph.\"--_Bookman._\r\n\r\n    \"One of the cleverest books ever written.\"--_Birmingham Post._\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Wells sustains his reputation as the leading novelist of the\r\n    unknown in his latest effort of imagination, 'When the Sleeper\r\n    Wakes.'\"--_The World._\r\n\r\n    \"There is more than the triumph of extravagant fancy in Mr. Wells's\r\n    book; its undertones are well worth attention too.\"--_The World._\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Wells beats Jules Verne on his own ground.\"--_Daily News._\r\n\r\n    \"An enthralling effort of imagination, vivid and bizarre as a\r\n    powerful nightmare.\"--_The Guardian._\r\n\r\n    \"This is undoubtedly a most remarkable book, a _tour de force_ of\r\n    the intellect and imagination.\"--_The Queen._\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Harper & Brothers, 45 Albemarle Street\r\n                               London, W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Successful Short Stories\r\n\r\n\r\n _By Thomas Hardy_\r\n     A Group of Noble Dames.             _Price 6s._\r\n     Life's Little Ironies.              _Price 6s._\r\n     Wessex Tales.                       _Price 6s._\r\n\r\n _By Mary E.
