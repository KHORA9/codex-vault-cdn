While there\r\nhas not perhaps been anything of a very revolutionary character, steady\r\nprogress has still been made in practically all branches, and the aim of\r\nthe present work is to describe the manufacture of Household and Toilet\r\nSoaps as carried out to-day in an up-to-date and well-equipped factory.\r\n\r\nIn the more scientific portions of the book, an acquaintance with the\r\nprinciples of elementary chemistry is assumed, and in this we feel\r\njustified, as in these days of strenuous competition, no soap-maker can\r\nhope to compete successfully with his rivals unless he has a sound\r\ntheoretical as well as practical knowledge of the nature of the raw\r\nmaterials he uses, and the reactions taking place in the pan, or at\r\nother stages of the manufacture. We also venture to hope that the work\r\nmay prove useful to Works' Chemists and other Analysts consulted in\r\nconnection with this Industry.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the greater part of the book no chemical knowledge\r\nis necessary, the subject being treated in such a way that it is hoped\r\nthose who are not directly engaged in the manufacture of soap, but who\r\ndesire a general idea of the subject, will find it of value.\r\n\r\nIn the sections dealing with the composition and analysis of materials,\r\ntemperatures are expressed in degrees Centigrade, these being now almost\r\ninvariably used in scientific work. In the rest of the book, however,\r\nthey are given in degrees Fahrenheit (the degrees Centigrade being also\r\nadded in brackets), as in the majority of factories these are still\r\nused.\r\n\r\nAs regards strengths of solution, in some factories the use of Baume\r\ndegrees is preferred, whilst in others Twaddell degrees are the custom,\r\nand we have therefore given the two figures in all cases.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter dealing with Oils and Fats, their Saponification\r\nEquivalents are given in preference to Saponification Values, as it has\r\nbeen our practice for some years to express our results in this way, as\r\nsuggested by Allen in _Commercial Organic Analysis_, and all our\r\nrecords, from which most of the figures for the chief oils and fats are\r\ntaken, are so stated.\r\n\r\nFor the illustrations, the authors are indebted to Messrs.

Hist._, xxviii., 12, 51)\r\nsoap was first introduced into Rome from Germany, having been discovered\r\nby the Gauls, who used the product obtained by mixing goats' tallow and\r\nbeech ash for giving a bright hue to the hair. In West Central Africa,\r\nmoreover, the natives, especially the Fanti race, have been accustomed\r\nto wash themselves with soap prepared by mixing crude palm oil and water\r\nwith the ashes of banana and plantain skins. The manufacture of soap\r\nseems to have flourished during the eighth century in Italy and Spain,\r\nand was introduced into France some five hundred years later, when\r\nfactories were established at Marseilles for the manufacture of\r\nolive-oil soap. Soap does not appear to have been made in England until\r\nthe fourteenth century, and the first record of soap manufacture in\r\nLondon is in 1524. From this time till the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the manufacture of soap developed very slowly, being essentially\r\ncarried on by rule-of-thumb methods, but the classic researches of\r\nChevreul on the constitution of fats at once placed the industry upon a\r\nscientific basis, and stimulated by Leblanc's discovery of a process for\r\nthe commercial manufacture of caustic soda from common salt, the\r\nproduction of soap has advanced by leaps and bounds until it is now one\r\nof the most important of British industries.\r\n\r\n_Definition of Soap_.--The word soap (Latin _sapo_, which is cognate\r\nwith Latin _sebum_, tallow) appears to have been originally applied to\r\nthe product obtained by treating tallow with ashes. In its strictly\r\nchemical sense it refers to combinations of fatty acids with metallic\r\nbases, a definition which includes not only sodium stearate, oleate and\r\npalmitate, which form the bulk of the soaps of commerce, but also the\r\nlinoleates of lead, manganese, etc., used as driers, and various\r\npharmaceutical preparations, _e.g._, mercury oleate (_Hydrargyri\r\noleatum_), zinc oleate and lead plaster, together with a number of other\r\nmetallic salts of fatty acids. Technically speaking, however, the\r\nmeaning of the term soap is considerably restricted, being generally\r\nlimited to the combinations of fatty acids and alkalies, obtained by\r\ntreating various animal or vegetable fatty matters, or the fatty acids\r\nderived therefrom, with soda or potash, the former giving hard soaps,\r\nthe latter soft soaps.\r\n\r\nThe use of ammonia as an alkali for soap-making purposes has often been\r\nattempted, but owing to the ease with which the resultant soap is\r\ndecomposed, it can scarcely be looked upon as a product of much\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\nH. Jackson has, however, recently patented (Eng. Pat. 6,712, 1906) the\r\nuse of ammonium oleate for laundry work. This detergent is prepared in\r\nthe wash-tub at the time of use, and it is claimed that goods are\r\ncleansed by merely immersing them in this solution for a short time and\r\nrinsing in fresh water.\r\n\r\nNeither of the definitions given above includes the sodium and potassium\r\nsalts of rosin, commonly called rosin soap, for the acid constituents of\r\nrosin have been shown to be aromatic, but in view of the analogous\r\nproperties of these resinates to true soap, they are generally regarded\r\nas legitimate constituents of soap, having been used in Great Britain\r\nsince 1827, and receiving legislative sanction in Holland in 1875.\r\n\r\nOther definitions of soap have been given, based not upon its\r\ncomposition, but upon its properties, among which may be mentioned that\r\nof Kingzett, who says that \"Soap, considered commercially, is a body\r\nwhich on treatment with water liberates alkali,\" and that of Nuttall,\r\nwho defines soap as \"an alkaline or unctuous substance used in washing\r\nand cleansing\".\r\n\r\n_Properties of Soap._--Both soda and potash soaps are readily soluble in\r\neither alcohol or hot water. In cold water they dissolve more slowly,\r\nand owing to slight decomposition, due to hydrolysis (_vide infra_), the\r\nsolution becomes distinctly turbid. Sodium oleate is peculiar in not\r\nundergoing hydrolysis except in very dilute solution and at a low\r\ntemperature. On cooling a hot soap solution, a jelly of more or less\r\nfirm consistence results, a property possessed by colloidal bodies, such\r\nas starch and gelatine, in contradistinction to substances which under\r\nthe same conditions deposit crystals, due to diminished solubility of\r\nthe salt at a lower temperature.\r\n\r\nKrafft (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1896, 206, 601; 1899, 691; and 1902,\r\n1301) and his collaborators, Wiglow, Strutz and Funcke, have\r\ninvestigated this property of soap solutions very fully, the researches\r\nextending over several years. In the light of their more recent work,\r\nthe molecules, or definite aggregates of molecules, of solutions which\r\nbecome gelatinous on cooling move much more slowly than the molecules in\r\nthe formation of a crystal, but there is a definite structure, although\r\narranged differently to that of a crystal. In the case of soda soaps the\r\ncolloidal character increases with the molecular weight of the fatty\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nSoda soaps are insoluble in concentrated caustic lyes, and, for the most\r\npart, in strong solutions of sodium chloride, hence the addition of\r\ncaustic soda or brine to a solution of soda soap causes the soap to\r\nseparate out and rise to the surface. Addition of brine to a solution of\r\npotash soap, on the other hand, merely results in double decomposition,\r\nsoda soap and potassium chloride being formed, thus:--\r\n\r\n    C_{17}H_{35}COOK + NaCl   =  C_{17}H_{35}COONa + KCl\r\n      potassium       sodium       sodium          potassium\r\n      stearate       chloride     stearate         chloride\r\n\r\nThe solubility of the different soaps in salt solution varies very\r\nconsiderably. Whilst sodium stearate is insoluble in a 5 per cent.\r\nsolution of sodium chloride, sodium laurate requires a 17 per cent.\r\nsolution to precipitate it, and sodium caproate is not thrown out of\r\nsolution even by a saturated solution.\r\n\r\n_Hydrolysis of Soap_.--The term \"hydrolysis\" is applied to any\r\nresolution of a body into its constituents where the decomposition is\r\nbrought about by the action of water, hence when soap is treated with\r\n_cold_ water, it is said to undergo hydrolysis, the reaction taking\r\nplace being represented in its simplest form by the equation:--\r\n\r\n    2NaC_{18}H_{35}O_{2} + H_{2}O  =  NaOH +   HNa(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{2}\r\n    sodium                  water    caustic      acid sodium\r\n    stearate                         soda         stearate\r\n\r\nThe actual reaction which occurs has been the subject of investigation\r\nby many chemists, and very diverse conclusions have been arrived at.\r\nChevreul, the pioneer in the modern chemistry of oils and fats, found\r\nthat a small amount of alkali was liberated, as appears in the above\r\nequation, together with the formation of an acid salt, a very minute\r\nquantity of free fatty acid remaining in solution. Rotondi (_Journ. Soc.\r\nChem. Ind._, 1885, 601), on the other hand, considered that a neutral\r\nsoap, on being dissolved in water, was resolved into a basic and an acid\r\nsalt, the former readily soluble in both hot and cold water, the latter\r\ninsoluble in cold water, and only slightly soluble in hot water. He\r\nappears, however, to have been misled by the fact that sodium oleate is\r\nreadily soluble in cold water, and his views have been shown to be\r\nincorrect by Krafft and Stern (_Ber. d. Chem. Ges._, 1894, 1747 and\r\n1755), who from experiments with pure sodium palmitate and stearate\r\nentirely confirm the conclusions arrived at by Chevreul.\r\n\r\nThe extent of dissociation occurring when a soap is dissolved in water\r\ndepends upon the nature of the fatty acids from which the soap is made,\r\nand also on the concentration of the solution. The sodium salts of\r\ncocoa-nut fatty acids (capric, caproic and caprylic acids) are by far\r\nthe most easily hydrolysed, those of oleic acid and the fatty acids from\r\ncotton-seed oil being dissociated more readily than those of stearic\r\nacid and tallow fatty acids. The decomposition increases with the amount\r\nof water employed.\r\n\r\nThe hydrolytic action of water on soap is affected very considerably by\r\nthe presence of certain substances dissolved in the water, particularly\r\nsalts of calcium and magnesium. Caustic soda exerts a marked retarding\r\neffect on the hydrolysis, as do also ethyl and amyl alcohols and\r\nglycerol.\r\n\r\n_Detergent Action of Soap._--The property possessed by soap of removing\r\ndirt is one which it is difficult to satisfactorily explain. Many\r\ntheories, more or less complicated, have been suggested, but even now\r\nthe question cannot be regarded as solved.\r\n\r\nThe explanation commonly accepted is that the alkali liberated by\r\nhydrolysis attacks any greasy matter on the surface to be cleansed, and,\r\nas the fat is dissolved, the particles of dirt are loosened and easily\r\nwashed off. Berzelius held this view, and considered that the value of a\r\nsoap depended upon the ease with which it yielded free alkali on\r\nsolution in water.\r\n\r\nThis theory is considered by Hillyer (_Journ. Amer. Chem. Soc._, 1903,\r\n524), however, to be quite illogical, for, as he points out, the\r\nliberated alkali would be far more likely to recombine with the acid or\r\nacid salt from which it has been separated, than to saponify a neutral\r\nglyceride, while, further, unsaponifiable greasy matter is removed by\r\nsoap as easily as saponifiable fat, and there can be no question of any\r\nchemical action of the free alkali in its case. Yet another argument\r\nagainst the theory is that hydrolysis is greater in cold and dilute\r\nsolutions, whereas hot concentrated soap solutions are generally\r\nregarded as having the best detergent action.\r\n\r\nRotondi (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1885, 601) was of the opinion that\r\nthe basic soap, which he believed to be formed by hydrolysis, was alone\r\nresponsible for the detergent action of soap, this basic soap dissolving\r\nfatty matter by saponification, but, as already pointed out, his theory\r\nof the formation of a basic soap is now known to be incorrect, and his\r\nconclusions are therefore invalid.\r\n\r\nSeveral explanations have been suggested, based on the purely physical\r\nproperties of soap solutions. Most of these are probably, at any rate in\r\npart, correct, and there can be little doubt that the ultimate solution\r\nof the problem lies in this direction, and that the detergent action of\r\nsoap will be found to depend on many of these properties, together with\r\nother factors not yet known.\r\n\r\nJevons in 1878 in some researches on the \"Brownian movement\" or\r\n\"pedesis\" of small particles, a movement of the particles which is\r\nobserved to take place when clay, iron oxide, or other finely divided\r\ninsoluble matter is suspended in water, found that the pedetic action\r\nwas considerably increased by soap and sodium silicate, and suggested\r\nthat to this action of soap might be attributed much of its cleansing\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAlder Wright considered that the alkali liberated by hydrolysis in some\r\nway promoted contact of the water with the substance to be cleansed, and\r\nKnapp regarded the property of soap solutions themselves to facilitate\r\ncontact of the water with the dirt, as one of the chief causes of the\r\nefficacy of soap as a detergent.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which it has been suggested that soap acts as a cleanser\r\nis that the soap itself or the alkali set free by hydrolysis serves as a\r\nlubricant, making the dirt less adherent, and thus promoting its\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\nThe most likely theory yet advanced is that based on the emulsifying\r\npower of soap solutions. The fact that these will readily form emulsions\r\nwith oils has long been known, and the detergent action of soap has\r\nfrequently been attributed to it, the explanation given being that the\r\nalkali set free by the water emulsifies the fatty matter always adhering\r\nto dirt, and carries it away in suspension with the other impurities.\r\nExperiments by Hillyer (_loc. cit._) show, however, that while N/10\r\nsolution of alkali will readily emulsify a cotton-seed oil containing\r\nfree acidity, no emulsion is produced with an oil from which all the\r\nacidity has been removed, or with kerosene, whereas a N/10 solution of\r\nsodium oleate will readily give an emulsion with either, thus proving\r\nthat the emulsification is due to the soap itself, and not to the\r\nalkali.\r\n\r\nPlateau (_Pogg. Ann._, 141, 44) and Quincke (_Wiedmann's. Ann._, 35,\r\n592) have made very complete researches on the emulsification and\r\nfoaming of liquids and on the formation of bubbles. The former considers\r\nthat there are two properties of a liquid which play an important part\r\nin the phenomenon, (1) it must have considerable viscosity, and (2) its\r\nsurface tension must be low. Quincke holds similar views, but considers\r\nthat no pure liquid will foam.\r\n\r\nSoap solution admirably fulfils Plateau's second condition, its surface\r\ntension being only about 40 per cent. of that of water, while its\r\ncohesion is also very small; and it is doubtless to this property that\r\nits emulsifying power is chiefly due. So far as viscosity is concerned,\r\nthis can have but little influence, for a 1 per cent. solution of sodium\r\noleate, which has a viscosity very little different from that of pure\r\nwater, is an excellent emulsifying agent.\r\n\r\nHillyer, to whose work reference has already been made, investigated the\r\nwhole question of detergent action very exhaustively, and, as the result\r\nof a very large number of experiments, concludes that the cleansing\r\npower of soap is largely or entirely to be explained by the power which\r\nit has of emulsifying oily substances, of wetting and penetrating into\r\noily textures, and of lubricating texture and impurities so that these\r\nmay be removed easily. It is thought that all these properties may be\r\nexplained by taking into account the low cohesion of the soap solutions,\r\nand their strong attraction or affinity to oily matter, which together\r\ncause the low surface tension between soap solution and oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION OF OILS AND FATS, AND THEIR SAPONIFICATION.\r\n\r\n     _Researches of Chevreul and Berthelot--Mixed Glycerides--Modern\r\n     Theories of Saponification--Hydrolysis accelerated by (1) Heat\r\n     or Electricity, (2) Ferments; Castor-seed Ferment, Steapsin,\r\n     Emulsin, and (3) Chemical Reagents; Sulphuric Acid, Twitchell's\r\n     Reagent, Hydrochloric Acid, Lime, Magnesia, Zinc Oxide, Soda\r\n     and Potash._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term oil is of very wide significance, being applied to substances\r\nof vastly different natures, both organic and inorganic, but so far as\r\nsoap-making materials are concerned, it may be restricted almost\r\nentirely to the products derived from animal and vegetable sources,\r\nthough many attempts have been made during the last few years to also\r\nutilise mineral oils for the preparation of soap. Fats readily become\r\noils on heating beyond their melting points, and may be regarded as\r\nfrozen oils.\r\n\r\nAlthough Scheele in 1779 discovered that in the preparation of lead\r\nplaster glycerol is liberated, soap at that time was regarded as a mere\r\nmechanical mixture, and the constitution of oils and fats was not\r\nproperly understood. It was Chevreul who showed that the manufacture of\r\nsoap involved a definite chemical decomposition of the oil or fat into\r\nfatty acid and glycerol, the fatty acid combining with soda, potash, or\r\nother base, to form the soap, and the glycerol remaining free. The\r\nreactions with stearin and palmitin (of which tallow chiefly consists)\r\nand with olein (found largely in olive and cotton-seed oils) are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n          CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{35}                             CH_{2}OH\r\n          |                                                |\r\n          CHOOC_{18}H_{35} + 3NaOH = 3NaOOC_{18}H_{35} +   CHOH\r\n          |                                                |\r\n          CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{35}                             CH_{2}OH\r\n\r\n            stearin         sodium       sodium            glycerol\r\n                           hydroxide     stearate\r\n\r\n\r\n          CH_{2}OOC_{16}H_{31}                             CH_{2}OH\r\n          |                                                |\r\n          CHOOC_{16}H_{31} + 3NaOH = 3NaOOC_{16}H_{31} +   CHOH\r\n          |                                                |\r\n          CH_{2}OOC_{16}H_{31}                             CH_{2}OH\r\n\r\n             palmitin        sodium      sodium            glycerol\r\n                            hydroxide    palmitate\r\n\r\n          CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{33}                           CH_{2}OH\r\n          |                                              |\r\n          CHOOC_{18}H_{33} + 3NaOH = 3NaOOC_{18}H_{33} + CHOH\r\n          |                                              |\r\n          CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{33}                           CH_{2}OH\r\n\r\n          olein              sodium    sodium            glycerol\r\n                            hydroxide  oleate\r\n\r\nBerthelot subsequently confirmed Chevreul's investigations by directly\r\nsynthesising the fats from fatty acids and glycerol, the method he\r\nadopted consisting in heating the fatty acids with glycerol in sealed\r\ntubes. Thus, for example:--\r\n\r\n  3C_{18}H_{35}O_{2}H + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} = C_{3}H_{5}(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{3}\r\n  stearic acid           glycerol              tristearin\r\n\r\nSince glycerol is a trihydric alcohol, _i.e._, contains three hydroxyl\r\n(OH) groups, the hydrogen atoms of which are displaceable by acid\r\nradicles, the above reaction may be supposed to take place in three\r\nstages. Thus, we may have:--\r\n\r\n    (1) C_{18}H_{35}O_{2}H + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} =\r\n           C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{2}C_{18}H_{35}O_{2} + H_{2}O\r\n                                            monostearin\r\n\r\n    (2) C_{18}H_{35}O_{2}H + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{2}C_{18}H_{35}O_{2} =\r\n           C_{3}H_{5}(OH)(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{2} + H_{2}O\r\n                                            distearin\r\n\r\n    (3) C_{18}H_{35}O_{2}H + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{2} =\r\n           C_{3}H_{5}(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{3} + H_{2}O\r\n                                            tristearin\r\n\r\nThere are two possible forms of monoglyceride and diglyceride, according\r\nto the relative position of the acid radicle, these being termed alpha\r\nand beta respectively, and represented by the following formulae, where R\r\ndenotes the acid radicle:--\r\n\r\n_Monoglyceride_:--\r\n\r\n                   CH_{2}OR                     CH_{2}OH\r\n                   |                            |\r\n          (alpha)  CHOH           and (beta)    CHOR\r\n                   |                            |\r\n                   CH_{2}OH                     CH_{2}OH\r\n\r\n_Diglyceride_:--\r\n\r\n                   CH_{2}OR                     CH_{2}OR\r\n                   |                            |\r\n          (alpha)  CHOH           and (beta)    CHOR\r\n                   |                            |\r\n                   CH_{2}OR                     CH_{2}OH\r\n\r\nAccording to the relative proportions of fatty acid and glycerol used,\r\nand the temperature to which they were heated, Berthelot succeeded in\r\npreparing mono-, di- and triglycerides of various fatty acids.\r\n\r\nPractically all the oils and fats used in soap-making consist of\r\nmixtures of these compounds of glycerol with fatty acids, which\r\ninvariably occur in nature in the form of triglycerides.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly considered that the three acid radicles in any naturally\r\noccurring glyceride were identical, corresponding to the formula--\r\n\r\n          CH_{2}OR\r\n          |\r\n          CHOR\r\n          |\r\n          CH_{2}OR\r\n\r\nwhere R denotes the acid radicle. Recent work, however, has shown the\r\nexistence of several so-called _mixed glycerides_, in which the\r\nhydroxyls of the same molecule of glycerol are displaced by two or\r\nsometimes three different acid radicles.\r\n\r\nThe first mixed glyceride to be discovered was oleodistearin,\r\nC_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{35}O)(OC_{18}H_{35}O)_{2}, obtained by Heise in 1896\r\nMkani fat. Hansen has since found that tallow contains oleodipalmitin,\r\nfrom C_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{35}O)(OC_{16}H_{31}O), stearodipalmitin,\r\nC_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{35}O)(OC_{16}H_{31}O), oleopalmitostearin,\r\nC_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{33}O)(OC_{16}H_{31}O)(OC_{18}H_{35}O) and\r\npalmitodistearin, CH(OC_{16}H_{31}O)(OC_{18}H_{35}O)_{2}, the latter of\r\nwhich has also been obtained by Kreis and Hafner from lard, while Holde\r\nand Stange have shown that olive oil contains from 1 to 2 per cent. of\r\noleodidaturin, C_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{33}O)(OC_{17}H_{33}O)_{2}, and\r\nHehner and Mitchell have obtained indications of mixed glycerides in\r\nlinseed oil (which they consider contains a compound of glycerol with\r\ntwo radicles of linolenic acid and one radicle of oleic acid), also in\r\ncod-liver, cod, whale and shark oils.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the fatty acids are combined with other bases than\r\nglycerol. As examples may be cited beeswax, containing myricin or\r\nmyricyl palmitate, and spermaceti, consisting chiefly of cetin or cetyl\r\npalmitate, and herein lies the essential difference between fats and\r\nwaxes, but as these substances are not soap-making materials, though\r\nsometimes admixed with soap to accomplish some special object, they do\r\nnot require further consideration.\r\n\r\nThe principal pure triglycerides, with their formulae and chief\r\nconstants, are given in the following table:--\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: Table split to fit on page better.]\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGlyceride. |          Formula.                   | Chief Occurrence.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nButyrin    | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{4}H_{7}O)_{3}       |   Butter fat\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIsovalerin | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{5}H_{9}O)_{3}       |  Porpoise, dolphin\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCaproin    | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{6}H_{11}O)_{3}      |   Cocoa-nut and\r\n           |                                     |    palm-nut oils\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCaprylin   | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{8}H_{15}O)_{3}      |     Do. do.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCaprin     | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{10}H_{19}O)_{3}     |     Do.  do.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLaurin     | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{12}H_{23}O)_{3}     |     Do.  do.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMyristin   | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{14}H_{27}O)_{3}     |   Nutmeg butter\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPalmitin   | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{16}H_{31}O)_{3}     |   Palm oil, lard\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStearin    | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{18}H_{35}O)_{3}     |   Tallow, lard,\r\n           |                                     |   cacao butter\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOlein      | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{18}H_{33}O)_{3}     |   Olive and\r\n           |                                     |   almond oils\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRicinolein | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{18}H_{33}O_{2})_{3} |   Castor oil\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGlyceride.  |   Melting        | Refractive          |  Saponification\r\n            |  Point, deg.C.   | Index at 60 deg.

The presence of stearin and\r\npalmitin, which are solid at the ordinary temperature, gives firmness to\r\na fat; the greater the percentage present, the harder the fat and the\r\nhigher will be the melting point, hence tallows and palm oils are solid,\r\nfirm fats. Where olein, which is liquid, is the chief constituent, we\r\nhave softer fats, such as lard, and liquid oils, as almond, olive and\r\ncotton-seed.\r\n\r\n_Stearin_ (Tristearin) can be prepared from tallow by crystallisation\r\nfrom a solution in ether, forming small crystals which have a bright\r\npearly lustre. The melting point of stearin appears to undergo changes\r\nand suggests the existence of distinct modifications. When heated to 55 deg.\r\nC. stearin liquefies; with increase of temperature it becomes solid, and\r\nagain becomes liquid at 71.6 deg. C. If this liquid be further heated to 76 deg.\r\nC., and allowed to cool, it will not solidify until 55 deg. C. is reached,\r\nbut if the liquid at 71.6 deg. C. be allowed to cool, solidification will\r\noccur at 70 deg. C.\r\n\r\n_Palmitin_ (Tripalmitin) may be obtained by heating together palmitic\r\nacid and glycerol, repeatedly boiling the resulting product with strong\r\nalcohol, and allowing it to crystallise. Palmitin exists in scales,\r\nwhich have a peculiar pearly appearance, and are greasy to the touch.\r\nAfter melting and solidifying, palmitin shows no crystalline fracture;\r\nwhen heated to 46 deg. C. it melts to a liquid which becomes solid on\r\nfurther heating, again liquefying when 61.7 deg. C. is reached, and becoming\r\ncloudy, with separation of crystalline particles. At 63 deg. C. it is quite\r\nclear, and this temperature is taken as the true melting point. It has\r\nbeen suggested that the different changes at the temperatures mentioned\r\nare due to varying manipulation, such as rate at which the temperature\r\nis raised, and the initial temperature of the mass when previously cool.\r\n\r\n_Olein_ (Triolein) is an odourless, colourless, tasteless oil, which\r\nrapidly absorbs oxygen and becomes rancid. It has been prepared\r\nsynthetically by heating glycerol and oleic acid together, and may be\r\nobtained by submitting olive oil to a low temperature for several days,\r\nwhen the liquid portion may be further deprived of any traces of stearin\r\nand palmitin by dissolving in alcohol. Olein may be distilled _in vacuo_\r\nwithout decomposition taking place.\r\n\r\n_Laurin_ (Trilaurin) may be prepared synthetically from glycerol and\r\nlauric acid. It crystallises in needles, melting at 45 deg.-46 deg. C., which\r\nare readily soluble in ether, but only slightly so in cold absolute\r\nalcohol. Scheij gives its specific gravity, _d_60 deg./4 deg. = 0.8944. Laurin\r\nis the chief constituent of palm-kernel oil, and also one of the\r\nprincipal components of cocoa-nut oil.\r\n\r\n_Fatty Acids._--When a fat or oil is saponified with soda or potash, the\r\nresulting soap dissolved in hot water, and sufficient dilute sulphuric\r\nacid added to decompose the soap, an oily layer gradually rises to the\r\nsurface of the liquid, which, after clarifying by warming and washing\r\nfree from mineral acid, is soluble in alcohol and reddens blue litmus\r\npaper. This oily layer consists of the \"fatty acids\" or rather those\r\ninsoluble in water, acids like acetic, propionic, butyric, caproic,\r\ncaprylic and capric, which are all more or less readily soluble in\r\nwater, remaining for the most part dissolved in the aqueous portion. All\r\nthe acids naturally present in oils and fats, whether free or combined,\r\nare monobasic in character, that is to say, contain only one\r\ncarboxyl--CO.OH group. The more important fatty acids may be classified\r\naccording to their chemical constitution into five homologous series,\r\nhaving the general formulae:--\r\n\r\n            I. Stearic series     C_{n}H_{2n+1}COOH\r\n           II. Oleic series       C_{n}H_{2n-1}COOH\r\n          III. Linolic series     C_{n}H_{2n-3}COOH\r\n           IV.

The two first are liquid at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, distil without decomposition, and are miscible with water\r\nin all proportions; the next four are more or less soluble in water and\r\ndistil unchanged in the presence of water, as does also lauric acid,\r\nwhich is almost insoluble in cold water, and only slightly dissolved by\r\nboiling water. The higher acids of the series are solid, and are\r\ncompletely insoluble in water. All these acids are soluble in warm\r\nalcohol, and on being heated with solid caustic alkali undergo no\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nII. _Oleic Series:_--\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAcid.       | Formula.          | Melting |   Found in\r\n            |                   | Point,  |\r\n            |                   |  deg.C. |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTiglic      | C_{4}H_{7}COOH    | 64.5    |   Croton oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMoringic    | C_{14}H_{27}COOH  |  0      |   Ben oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPhysetoleic | C_{15}H_{29}COOH  | 30      |   Sperm oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHypogaeic    | C_{15}H_{29}COOH | 33      |   Arachis and maize oils.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOleic       | C_{17}H_{33}COOH  | 14      |   Most oils and fats.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRapic       | C_{17}H_{33}COOH  | ...     |   Rape oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDoeglic     | C_{18}H_{35}COOH  | ...     |   Bottle-nose oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nErucic      | C_{21}H_{41}COOH  | 34      |   Mustard oils, marine animal\r\n            |                   |         |     oils, rape oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe unsaturated nature of these acids renders their behaviour with\r\nvarious reagents entirely different from that of the preceding series.\r\nThus, they readily combine with bromine or iodine to form addition\r\ncompounds, and the lower members of the series are at once reduced, on\r\ntreatment with sodium amalgam in alkaline solution, to the corresponding\r\nsaturated acids of Series I. Unfortunately, this reaction does not apply\r\nto the higher acids such as oleic acid, but as the conversion of the\r\nlatter into solid acids is a matter of some technical importance from\r\nthe point of view of the candle-maker, a number of attempts have been\r\nmade to effect this by other methods.\r\n\r\nDe Wilde and Reychler have shown that by heating oleic acid with 1 per\r\ncent. of iodine in autoclaves up to 270 deg.-280 deg. C., about 70 per cent. is\r\nconverted into stearic acid, and Zuerer has devised (German Patent\r\n62,407) a process whereby the oleic acid is first converted by the\r\naction of chlorine into the dichloride, which is then reduced with\r\nnascent hydrogen. More recently Norman has secured a patent (English\r\nPatent 1,515, 1903) for the conversion of unsaturated fatty acids of\r\nSeries II. into the saturated compounds of Series I., by reduction with\r\nhydrogen or water-gas in the presence of finely divided nickel, cobalt\r\nor iron. It is claimed that by this method oleic acid is completely\r\ntransformed into stearic acid, and that the melting point of tallow\r\nfatty acids is raised thereby about 12 deg. C.\r\n\r\nAnother method which has been proposed is to run the liquid olein over\r\na series of electrically charged plates, which effects its reduction to\r\nstearin.\r\n\r\nStearic acid is also formed by treating oleic acid with fuming hydriodic\r\nacid in the presence of phosphorus, while other solid acids are obtained\r\nby the action of sulphuric acid or zinc chloride on oleic acid.\r\n\r\nAcids of Series II. may also be converted into saturated acids by\r\nheating to 300 deg.C. with solid caustic potash, which decomposes them into\r\nacids of the stearic series with liberation of hydrogen. This reaction,\r\nwith oleic acid, for example, is generally represented by the equation--\r\n\r\n  C_{18}H_{34}O_{2} + 2KOH = KC_{2}H_{3}O_{2} + KC_{16}H_{31}O_{2} + H_{2},\r\n\r\nthough it must be really more complex than this indicates, for, as Edmed\r\nhas pointed out, oxalic acid is also formed in considerable quantity.\r\nThe process on a commercial scale has now been abandoned.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important properties of this group of acids is the\r\nformation of isomeric acids of higher melting point on treatment with\r\nnitrous acid, generally termed the _elaidin reaction_. Oleic acid, for\r\nexample, acted upon by nitrous acid, yields elaidic acid, melting at\r\n45 deg., and erucic acid gives brassic acid, melting at 60 deg.C. This reaction\r\nalso occurs with the neutral glycerides of these acids, olein being\r\nconverted into elaidin, which melts at 32 deg.C.\r\n\r\nThe lead salts of the acids of this series are much more soluble in\r\nether, and the lithium salts more soluble in alcohol than those of the\r\nstearic series, upon both of which properties processes have been based\r\nfor the separation of the solid from the liquid fatty acids.\r\n\r\nIII. _Linolic Series:_--\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAcid.        |  Formula.        | Melting    | Found in\r\n             |                  | Point,     |\r\n             |                  |  deg.C.    |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nElaeomargaric | C_{16}H_{29}COOH |  ...       |  Chinese-wood oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nElaeostearic  | C_{16}H_{29}COOH |  71        |  Chinese-wood oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLinolic      | C_{17}H_{31}COOH |  Fluid     |  Linseed, cotton-seed and\r\n             |                  |            |  maize oils.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTariric      | C_{17}H_{31}COOH |  50.5      |  Tariri-seed oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTelfairic    | C_{17}H_{31}COOH |  Fluid     |  Telfairia oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese acids readily combine with bromine, iodine, or oxygen. They are\r\nunaffected by nitrous acid, and their lead salts are soluble in ether.\r\n\r\nIV. _Linolenic Series:_--\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAcid.        |  Formula.         | Found in\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLinolenic    |  C_{17}H_{29}COOH | Linseed oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIsolinolenic |  C_{17}H_{29}COOH | Linseed oil.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nJecoric      |  C_{17}H_{29}COOH | Cod-liver and marine animal oils.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese acids are similar in properties to those of Class III., but\r\ncombine with six atoms of bromine or iodine, whereas the latter combine\r\nwith only four atoms.\r\n\r\nV. _Ricinoleic Series:_--\r\n\r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n|            |                      |         |             |\r\n|    Acid.   |        Formula.      | Melting |  Found in   |\r\n|            |                      |  Point, |             |\r\n|            |                      |  deg.C. |             |\r\n|------------|----------------------|---------|-------------|\r\n|            |                      |         |             |\r\n| Ricinoleic | C_{17}H_{22}(OH)COOH |   4-5   | Castor oil. |\r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis acid combines with two atoms of bromine or iodine, and is converted\r\nby nitrous acid into the isomeric ricinelaidic acid, which melts at\r\n52 deg.-53 deg. C. Pure ricinoleic acid, obtained from castor oil, is optically\r\nactive, its rotation being [alpha]_{d} +6 deg. 25'.\r\n\r\n_Hydrolysis or Saponification of Oils and Fats._--The decomposition of a\r\ntriglyceride, brought about by caustic alkalies in the formation of\r\nsoap, though generally represented by the equation already given (pp. 6\r\nand 7)--\r\n\r\n    C_{3}H_{5}(OR) + 3NaOH = C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} + 3RONa,\r\n\r\nis not by any means such a simple reaction.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, though in this equation no water appears, the\r\npresence of the latter is found to be indispensable for saponification\r\nto take place; in fact, the water must be regarded as actually\r\ndecomposing the oil or fat, caustic soda or potash merely acting as a\r\ncatalytic agent. Further, since in the glycerides there are three acid\r\nradicles to be separated from glycerol, their saponification can be\r\nsupposed to take place in three successive stages, which are the\r\nconverse of the formation of mono- and diglycerides in the synthesis of\r\ntriglycerides from fatty acids and glycerine. Thus, the above equation\r\nmay be regarded as a summary of the following three:--\r\n\r\n                           _                        _\r\n                          | OR                     | OH\r\n          (i.)

C_{3}H_{5} | OR + NaOH = C_{3}H_{5} | OH + RONa\r\n                            |_OH                     |_OH\r\n\r\nGeitel and Lewkowitsch, who have studied this question from the physical\r\nand chemical point of view respectively, are of opinion that when an\r\noil or fat is saponified, these three reactions do actually occur side\r\nby side, the soap-pan containing at the same time unsaponified\r\ntriglyceride, diglyceride, monoglyceride, glycerol and soap.\r\n\r\nThis theory is not accepted, however, by all investigators. Balbiano and\r\nMarcusson doubt the validity of Lewkowitsch's conclusions, and Fanto,\r\nexperimenting on the saponification of olive oil with caustic potash, is\r\nunable to detect the intermediate formation of any mono- or diglyceride,\r\nand concludes that in homogeneous solution the saponification is\r\npractically quadrimolecular. Kreeman, on the other hand, from\r\nphysico-chemical data, supports the view of Geitel and Lewkowitsch that\r\nsaponification is bimolecular, and though the evidence seems to favour\r\nthis theory, the matter cannot be regarded as yet definitely settled.\r\n\r\nHydrolysis can be brought about by water alone, if sufficient time is\r\nallowed, but as the process is extremely slow, it is customary in\r\npractice to accelerate the reaction by the use of various methods, which\r\ninclude (i.) the application of heat or electricity, (ii.) action of\r\nenzymes, and (iii.) treatment with chemicals; the accelerating effect of\r\nthe two latter methods is due to their emulsifying power.\r\n\r\nThe most usual method adopted in the manufacture of soap is to hydrolyse\r\nthe fat or oil by caustic soda or potash, the fatty acids liberated at\r\nthe same time combining with the catalyst, _i.e._, soda or potash, to\r\nform soap. Hitherto the other processes of hydrolysis have been employed\r\nchiefly for the preparation of material for candles, for which purpose\r\ncomplete separation of the glycerol in the first hydrolysis is not\r\nessential, since the fatty matter is usually subjected to a second\r\ntreatment with sulphuric acid to increase the proportion of solid fatty\r\nacids. The colour of the resulting fatty acids is also of no importance,\r\nas they are always subjected to distillation.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years, however, there has been a growing attempt to\r\nfirst separate the glycerol from the fatty acids, and then convert the\r\nlatter into soap by treatment with the carbonates of soda or potash,\r\nwhich are of course considerably cheaper than the caustic alkalies, but\r\ncannot be used in the actual saponification of a neutral fat. The two\r\nprocesses chiefly used for this purpose are those in which the reaction\r\nis brought about by enzymes or by Twitchell's reagent.\r\n\r\nI. _Application of Heat or Electricity._--Up to temperatures of 150 deg. C.\r\nthe effect of water on oils and fats is very slight, but by passing\r\nsuperheated steam through fatty matter heated to 200 deg.-300 deg. C. the\r\nneutral glycerides are completely decomposed into glycerol and fatty\r\nacids according to the equation--\r\n\r\n    C_{3}H_{5}(OR)_{3} + 3H.OH = C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} + 3ROH.\r\n\r\nThe fatty acids and glycerol formed distil over with the excess of\r\nsteam, and by arranging a series of condensers, the former, which\r\ncondense first, are obtained almost alone in the earlier ones, and an\r\naqueous solution of glycerine in the later ones. This method of\r\npreparation of fatty acids is extensively used in France for the\r\nproduction of stearine for candle-manufacture, but the resulting\r\nproduct is liable to be dark coloured, and to yield a dark soap. To\r\nexpose the acids to heat for a minimum of time, and so prevent\r\ndiscoloration, Mannig has patented (Germ. Pat. 160,111) a process\r\nwhereby steam under a pressure of 8 to 10 atmospheres is projected\r\nagainst a baffle plate mounted in a closed vessel, where it mixes with\r\nthe fat or oil in the form of a spray, the rate of hydrolysis being\r\nthereby, it is claimed, much increased.\r\n\r\nSimpson (Fr. Pat. 364,587) has attempted to accelerate further the\r\ndecomposition by subjecting oils or fats to the simultaneous action of\r\nheat and electricity. Superheated steam is passed into the oil, in which\r\nare immersed the two electrodes connected with a dynamo or battery, the\r\ntemperature not being allowed to exceed 270 deg. C.\r\n\r\nII. _Action of Enzymes._--It was discovered by Muntz in 1871 (_Annales\r\nde Chemie_, xxii.) that during germination of castor seeds a quantity of\r\nfatty acid was developed in the seeds, which he suggested might be due\r\nto the decomposition of the oil by the embryo acting as a ferment.\r\nSchutzenberger in 1876 showed that when castor seeds are steeped in\r\nwater, fatty acids and glycerol are liberated, and attributed this to\r\nthe hydrolytic action of an enzyme present in the seeds. No evidence of\r\nthe existence of such a ferment was adduced, however, till 1890, when\r\nGreen (_Roy. Soc. Proc._, 48, 370) definitely proved the presence in the\r\nseeds of a ferment capable of splitting up the oil into fatty acid and\r\nglycerol.\r\n\r\nThe first experimenters to suggest any industrial application of this\r\nenzymic hydrolysis were Connstein, Hoyer and Wartenburg, who\r\n(_Berichte_, 1902, 35, pp. 3988-4006) published the results of a lengthy\r\ninvestigation of the whole subject. They found that tallow, cotton-seed,\r\npalm, olive, almond, and many other oils, were readily hydrolysed by the\r\ncastor-seed ferment in the presence of dilute acid, but that cocoa-nut\r\nand palm-kernel oils only decomposed with difficulty. The presence of\r\nacidity is essential for the hydrolysis to take place, the most suitable\r\nstrength being one-tenth normal, and the degree of hydrolysis is\r\nproportional to the quantity of ferment present. Sulphuric, phosphoric,\r\nacetic or butyric acids, or sodium bisulphate, may be used without much\r\ninfluence on the result. Butyric acid is stated to be the best, but in\r\npractice is too expensive, and acetic acid is usually adopted. The\r\nemulsified mixture should be allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, and\r\nthe temperature should not exceed 40 deg. C.; at 50 deg. C. the action is\r\nweakened, and at 100 deg. C. ceases altogether.\r\n\r\nSeveral investigators have since examined the hydrolysing power of\r\nvarious other seeds, notably Braun and Behrendt (_Berichte_, 1903, 36,\r\n1142-1145, 1900-1901, and 3003-3005), who, in addition to confirming\r\nConnstein, Hoyer and Wartenburg's work with castor seeds, have made\r\nsimilar experiments with jequirity seeds (_Abrus peccatorius_)\r\ncontaining the enzyme abrin, emulsin from crushed almonds, the leaves of\r\n_Arctostaphylos Uva Ursi_, containing the glucoside arbutin, myrosin\r\nfrom black mustard-seed, gold lac (_Cheirantus cheiri_) and crotin from\r\ncroton seeds. Jequirity seeds were found to have a stronger decomposing\r\naction on lanoline and carnauba wax than the castor seed, but only\r\ncaused decomposition of castor oil after the initial acidity was first\r\nneutralised with alkali. Neither emulsin, arbutin nor crotin have any\r\nmarked hydrolytic action on castor oil, but myrosin is about half as\r\nactive as castor seeds, except in the presence of potassium myronate,\r\nwhen no decomposition occurs.\r\n\r\nS. Fokin (_J. russ. phys. chem. Ges._, 35, 831-835, and _Chem. Rev.\r\nFett. u. Harz. Ind._, 1904, 30 _et seq._) has examined the hydrolytic\r\naction of a large number of Russian seeds, belonging to some thirty\r\ndifferent families, but although more than half of these brought about\r\nthe hydrolysis of over 10 per cent. of fat, he considers that in only\r\ntwo cases, _viz._, the seeds of _Chelidonium majus_ and _Linaria\r\nvulgaris_, is the action due to enzymes, these being the only two seeds\r\nfor which the yield of fatty acids is proportional to the amount of seed\r\nemployed, while in many instances hydrolysis was not produced when the\r\nseeds were old. The seeds of _Chelidonium majus_ were found to have as\r\ngreat, and possibly greater, enzymic activity than castor seeds, but\r\nthose of _Linaria_ are much weaker, twenty to thirty parts having only\r\nthe same lipolytic activity as four to five parts of castor seeds.\r\n\r\nThe high percentage of free acids found in rice oil has led C. A. Brown,\r\njun. (_Journ. Amer. Chem. Soc._, 1903, 25, 948-954), to examine the rice\r\nbran, which proves to have considerable enzymic activity, and rapidly\r\neffects the hydrolysis of glycerides.\r\n\r\nThe process for the utilisation of enzymic hydrolysis in the separation\r\nof fatty acids from glycerine on the industrial scale, as originally\r\ndevised by Connstein and his collaborators, consisted in rubbing a\r\nquantity of the coarsely crushed castor seeds with part of the oil or\r\nfat, then adding the rest of the oil, together with acidified water\r\n(N/10 acetic acid). The quantities employed were 6-1/2 parts of\r\ndecorticated castor beans for every 100 parts of oil or fat, and 50 to\r\n60 parts of acetic acid. After stirring until an emulsion is formed, the\r\nmixture is allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, during which\r\nhydrolysis takes place. The temperature is then raised to 70 deg.-80 deg. C.,\r\nwhich destroys the enzyme, and a 25 per cent. solution of sulphuric\r\nacid, equal in amount to one-fiftieth of the total quantity of fat\r\noriginally taken, added to promote separation of the fatty acids. In\r\nthis way three layers are formed, the one at the top consisting of the\r\nclear fatty acids, the middle one an emulsion containing portions of the\r\nseeds, fatty acids and glycerine, and the bottom one consisting of the\r\naqueous glycerine. The intermediate layer is difficult to treat\r\nsatisfactorily; it is generally washed twice with water, the washings\r\nbeing added to glycerine water, and the fatty mixture saponified and the\r\nresultant soap utilised.\r\n\r\nThe process has been the subject of a considerable amount of\r\ninvestigation, numerous attempts having been made to actually separate\r\nthe active fat-splitting constituent of the seeds, or to obtain it in a\r\npurer and more concentrated form than is furnished by the seeds\r\nthemselves. Nicloux (_Comptes Rendus_, 1904, 1112, and _Roy. Soc.\r\nProc._, 1906, 77 B, 454) has shown that the hydrolytic activity of\r\ncastor seeds is due entirely to the cytoplasm, which it is possible to\r\nseparate by mechanical means from the aleurone grains and all other\r\ncellular matter. This active substance, which he terms \"lipaseidine,\" is\r\nconsidered to be not an enzyme, though it acts as such, following the\r\nordinary laws of enzyme action; its activity is destroyed by contact\r\nwith water in the absence of oil. This observer has patented (Eng. Pat.\r\n8,304, 1904) the preparation of an \"extract\" by triturating crushed\r\ncastor or other seeds with castor oil, filtering the oily extract, and\r\nsubjecting it to centrifugal force. The deposit consists of aleurone and\r\nthe active enzymic substance, together with about 80 per cent. of oil,\r\nand one part of it will effect nearly complete hydrolysis of 100 parts\r\nof oil in twenty-four hours. In a subsequent addition to this patent,\r\nthe active agent is separated from the aleurone by extraction with\r\nbenzene and centrifugal force. By the use of such an extract, the\r\nquantity of albuminoids brought into contact with the fat is reduced to\r\nabout 10 per cent. of that in the original seeds, and the middle layer\r\nbetween the glycerine solution and fatty acids is smaller and can be\r\nsaponified directly for the production of curd soap, while the glycerine\r\nsolution also is purer.\r\n\r\nIn a further patent Nicloux (Fr. Pat. 349,213, 1904) states that the use\r\nof an acid medium is unnecessary, and claims that even better results\r\nare obtained by employing a neutral solution of calcium sulphate\r\ncontaining a small amount of magnesium sulphate, the proportion of salts\r\nnot exceeding 0.5 per cent. of the fat, while in yet another patent,\r\njointly with Urbain (Fr. Pat. 349,942, 1904), it is claimed that the\r\nprocess is accelerated by the removal of acids from the oil or fat to be\r\ntreated, which may be accomplished by either washing first with\r\nacidulated water, then with pure water, or preferably by neutralising\r\nwith carbonate of soda and removing the resulting soap.\r\n\r\nLombard (Fr. Pat. 350,179, 1904) claims that acids act as stimulating\r\nagents in the enzymic hydrolysis of oils, and further that a simple\r\nmethod of obtaining the active product is to triturate oil cake with its\r\nown weight of water, allow the mixture to undergo spontaneous\r\nproteolytic hydrolysis at 40 deg. C. for eight days, and then filter, the\r\nfiltrate obtained being used in place of water in the enzymic process.\r\n\r\nHoyer, who has made a large number of experiments in the attempt to\r\nisolate the lipolytic substance from castor seeds, has obtained a\r\nproduct of great activity, which he terms \"ferment-oil,\" by extracting\r\nthe crushed seeds with a solvent for oils.\r\n\r\nThe Verein Chem. Werke have extended their original patent (addition\r\ndated 11th December, 1905, to Fr. Pat. 328,101, Oct., 1902), which now\r\ncovers the use of vegetable ferments in the presence of water and\r\nmanganese sulphate or other metallic salt. It is further stated that\r\nacetic acid may be added at the beginning of the operation, or use may\r\nbe made of that formed during the process, though in the latter case\r\nhydrolysis is somewhat slower.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been carried out by Lewkowitsch and Macleod (_Journ.\r\nSoc. Chem. Ind._, 1903, 68, and _Proc. Roy. Soc._, 1903, 31) with\r\nferments derived from animal sources, _viz._, lipase from pig's liver,\r\nand steapsin from the pig or ox pancreas. The former, although it has\r\nbeen shown by Kastle and Loevenhart (_Amer. Chem. Journ._, 1900, 49) to\r\nreadily hydrolyse ethyl butyrate, is found to have very little\r\nfat-splitting power, but with steapsin more favourable results have been\r\nobtained, though the yield of fatty acids in this case is considerably\r\ninferior to that given by castor seeds. With cotton-seed oil, 83-86 per\r\ncent. of fatty acids were liberated as a maximum after fifty-six days,\r\nbut with lard only 46 per cent. were produced in the same time. Addition\r\nof dilute acid or alkali appeared to exert no influence on the\r\ndecomposition of the cotton-seed oil, but in the case of the lard,\r\ndilute alkali seemed at first to promote hydrolysis, though afterwards\r\nto retard it.\r\n\r\nFokin (_Chem. Rev. Fett. u. Harz. Ind._, 1904, 118-120 _et seq._) has\r\nattempted to utilise the pancreatic juice on a technical scale, but the\r\nprocess proved too slow and too costly to have any practical use.\r\n\r\n_Rancidity._--The hydrolysing power of enzymes throws a good deal of\r\nlight on the development of rancidity in oils and fats, which is now\r\ngenerally regarded as due to the oxidation by air in the presence of\r\nlight and moisture of the free fatty acids contained by the oil or fat.\r\nIt has long been known that whilst recently rendered animal fats are\r\ncomparatively free from acidity, freshly prepared vegetable oils\r\ninvariably contain small quantities of free fatty acid, and there can be\r\nno doubt that this must be attributed to the action of enzymes contained\r\nin the seeds or fruit from which the oils are expressed, hence the\r\nnecessity for separating oils and fats from adhering albuminous matters\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n_Decomposition of Fats by Bacteria._--Though this subject is not of any\r\npractical interest in the preparation of fatty acids for soap-making, it\r\nmay be mentioned, in passing, that some bacteria readily hydrolyse fats.\r\nSchriber (_Arch. f. Hyg._, 41, 328-347) has shown that in the presence\r\nof air many bacteria promote hydrolysis, under favourable conditions as\r\nto temperature and access of oxygen, the process going beyond the simple\r\nsplitting up into fatty acid and glycerol, carbon dioxide and water\r\nbeing formed. Under anaerobic conditions, however, only a slight primary\r\nhydrolysis was found to take place, though according to Rideal (_Journ.\r\nSoc. Chem. Ind._, 1903, 69) there is a distinct increase in the amount\r\nof free fatty acids in a sewage after passage through a septic tank.\r\n\r\nExperiments have also been made on this subject by Rahn (_Centralb.\r\nBakteriol_, 1905, 422), who finds that _Penicillium glaucum_ and other\r\npenicillia have considerable action on fats, attacking the glycerol and\r\nlower fatty acids, though not oleic acid. A motile bacillus, producing\r\na green fluorescent colouring matter, but not identified, had a marked\r\nhydrolytic action and decomposed oleic acid. The name \"lipobacter\" has\r\nbeen proposed by De Kruyff for bacteria which hydrolyse fats.\r\n\r\nIII. _Use of Chemical Reagents._--Among the chief accelerators employed\r\nin the hydrolysis of oils are sulphuric acid and Twitchell's reagent\r\n(benzene- or naphthalene-stearosulphonic acid), while experiments have\r\nalso been made with hydrochloric acid (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1903,\r\n67) with fairly satisfactory results, and the use of sulphurous acid, or\r\nan alkaline bisulphite as catalyst, has been patented in Germany. To\r\nthis class belong also the bases, lime, magnesia, zinc oxide, ammonia,\r\nsoda and potash, though these latter substances differ from the former\r\nin that they subsequently combine with the fatty acids liberated to form\r\nsoaps.\r\n\r\n_Sulphuric Acid._--The hydrolysing action of concentrated sulphuric acid\r\nupon oils and fats has been known since the latter part of the\r\neighteenth century, but was not applied on a practical scale till 1840\r\nwhen Gwynne patented a process in which sulphuric acid was used to\r\nliberate the fatty acids, the latter being subsequently purified by\r\nsteam distillation. By this method, sulpho-compounds of the glyceride\r\nare first formed, which readily emulsify with water, and, on treatment\r\nwith steam, liberate fatty acids, the glycerol remaining partly in the\r\nform of glycero-sulphuric acid. The process has been investigated by\r\nFremy, Geitel, and more recently by Lewkowitsch (_J. Soc. of Arts_,\r\n\"Cantor Lectures,\" 1904, 795 _et seq._), who has conducted a series of\r\nexperiments on the hydrolysis of tallow with 4 per cent. of sulphuric\r\nacid of varying strengths, containing from 58 to 90 per cent. sulphuric\r\nacid, H_{2}SO_{4}. Acid of 60 per cent. or less appears to be\r\npractically useless as a hydrolysing agent, while with 70 per cent. acid\r\nonly 47.7 per cent. fatty acids were developed after twenty-two hours'\r\nsteaming, and with 80 and 85 per cent. acid, the maximum of 89.9 per\r\ncent. of fatty acids was only reached after fourteen and fifteen hours'\r\nsteaming respectively. Using 98 per cent. acid, 93 per cent. of fatty\r\nacids were obtained after nine hours' steaming, and after another seven\r\nhours, only 0.6 per cent. more fatty acids were produced. Further\r\nexperiments have shown that dilute sulphuric acid has also scarcely any\r\naction on cotton-seed, whale, and rape oils.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lant Carpenter, some 75 per cent. of solid fatty acids may\r\nbe obtained from tallow by the sulphuric acid process, owing to the\r\nconversion of a considerable quantity of oleic acid into isoleic acid\r\n(_vide_ p. 12), but in the process a considerable proportion of black\r\npitch is obtained. C. Dreymann has recently patented (Eng. Pat. 10,466,\r\n1904) two processes whereby the production of any large amount of\r\nhydrocarbons is obviated. In the one case, after saponification with\r\nsulphuric acid, the liberated fatty acids are washed with water and\r\ntreated with an oxide, carbonate, or other acid-fixing body, _e.g._,\r\nsodium carbonate, prior to distillation. In this way the distillate is\r\nmuch clearer than by the ordinary process, and is almost odourless,\r\nwhile the amount of unsaponifiable matter is only about 1.2 per cent.\r\nThe second method claimed consists in the conversion of the fatty acids\r\ninto their methyl esters by treatment with methyl alcohol and\r\nhydrochloric acid gas, and purification of the esters by steam\r\ndistillation, the pure esters being subsequently decomposed with\r\nsuperheated steam, in an autoclave, with or without the addition of an\r\noxide, _e.g._, 0.1 per cent. zinc oxide, to facilitate their\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\n_Twitchell's Reagent._--In Twitchell's process use is made of the\r\nimportant discovery that aqueous solutions of fatty aromatic sulphuric\r\nacids, such as benzene- or naphthalene-stearosulphonic acid, readily\r\ndissolve fatty bodies, thereby facilitating their dissociation into\r\nfatty acids and glycerol. These compounds are stable at 100 deg. C., and are\r\nprepared by treating a mixture of benzene or naphthalene and oleic acid\r\nwith an excess of sulphuric acid, the following reaction taking place:--\r\n\r\n    C_{6}H_{6} + C_{18}H_{34}O_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} =\r\n        C_{6}H_{4}(SO_{3}H)C_{18}H_{35}O + H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nOn boiling the resultant product with water two layers separate, the\r\nlower one consisting of a clear aqueous solution of sulphuric acid and\r\nwhatever benzene-sulphonic acid has been formed, while the upper layer,\r\nwhich is a viscous oil, contains the benzene-stearosulphonic acid. This,\r\nafter washing first with hydrochloric acid and then rapidly with\r\npetroleum ether, and drying at 100 deg. C. is then ready for use; the\r\naddition of a small quantity of this reagent to a mixture of fat\r\n(previously purified) and water, agitated by boiling with open steam,\r\neffects almost complete separation of the fatty acid from glycerol.\r\n\r\nThe process is generally carried out in two wooden vats, covered with\r\nclosely fitting lids, furnished with the necessary draw-off cocks, the\r\nfirst vat containing a lead coil and the other a brass steam coil.\r\n\r\nIn the first vat, the fat or oil is prepared by boiling with 1 or 2 per\r\ncent. of sulphuric acid (141 deg. Tw. or 60 deg. B.) for one or two hours and\r\nallowed to rest, preferably overnight; by this treatment the fat is\r\ndeprived of any dirt, lime or other impurity present. After withdrawing\r\nthe acid liquor, the fat or oil is transferred to the other vat, where\r\nit is mixed with one-fifth of its bulk of water (condensed or\r\ndistilled), and open steam applied. As soon as boiling takes place, the\r\nrequisite amount of reagent is washed into the vat by the aid of a\r\nlittle hot water through a glass funnel, and the whole is boiled\r\ncontinuously for twelve or even twenty-four hours, until the free fatty\r\nacids amount to 85-90 per cent. The amount of reagent used varies with\r\nthe grade of material, the smaller the amount consistent with efficient\r\nresults, the better the colour of the finished product; with good\r\nmaterial, from 1/2 to 3/4 per cent. is sufficient, but for materials of\r\nlower grade proportionately more up to 2 per cent. is required. The\r\nreaction appears to proceed better with materials containing a fair\r\nquantity of free acidity.\r\n\r\nWhen the process has proceeded sufficiently far, the boiling is stopped\r\nand free steam allowed to fill the vat to obviate any discoloration of\r\nthe fatty acids by contact with the air, whilst the contents of the vat\r\nsettle.\r\n\r\nThe settled glycerine water, which should amount in bulk to 50 or 60 per\r\ncent. of the fatty matter taken, and have a density of 7-1/2 deg. Tw. (5 deg.\r\nB.), is removed to a receptacle for subsequent neutralisation with milk\r\nof lime, and, after the separation of sludge, is ready for\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nThe fatty acids remaining in the vat are boiled with a small quantity\r\n(0.05 per cent., or 1/10 of the Twitchell reagent requisite) of\r\ncommercial barium carbonate, previously mixed with a little water; the\r\nboiling may be prolonged twenty or thirty minutes, and at the end of\r\nthat period the contents of the vat are allowed to rest; the water\r\nseparated should be neutral to methyl-orange indicator.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that fatty acids so treated are not affected by the air,\r\nand may be stored in wooden packages.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochloric Acid._--Lewkowitsch (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1903, 67)\r\nhas carried out a number of experiments on the accelerating influence of\r\nhydrochloric acid upon the hydrolysis of oils and fats, which show that\r\nacid of a specific gravity of 1.16 has a very marked effect on most\r\noils, cocoa-nut, cotton-seed, whale and rape oils, tallow and lard being\r\nbroken up into fatty acid and glycerol to the extent of some 82-96 per\r\ncent. after boiling 100 grams of the oil or fat with 100 c.c. of acid\r\nfor twenty-four hours. The maximum amount of hydrolysis was attained\r\nwith cocoa-nut oil, probably owing to its large proportion of the\r\nglycerides of volatile fatty acids. Castor oil is abnormal in only\r\nundergoing about 20 per cent. hydrolysis, but this is attributed to the\r\ndifferent constitution of its fatty acids, and the ready formation of\r\npolymerisation products. Experiments were also made as to whether the\r\naddition of other catalytic agents aided the action of the hydrochloric\r\nacid; mercury, copper sulphate, mercury oxide, zinc, zinc dust,\r\naluminium chloride, nitrobenzene and aniline being tried, in the\r\nproportion of 1 per cent. The experiments were made on neutral lard and\r\nlard containing 5 per cent. of free fatty acids, but in no case was any\r\nappreciable effect produced.\r\n\r\nSo far this process has not been adopted on the practical scale, its\r\nchief drawback being the length of time required for saponification.\r\nUndoubtedly the hydrolysis would be greatly facilitated if the oil and\r\nacid could be made to form a satisfactory emulsion, but although saponin\r\nhas been tried for the purpose, no means of attaining this object has\r\nyet been devised.\r\n\r\n_Sulphurous Acid or Bisulphite._--The use of these substances has been\r\npatented by Stein, Berge and De Roubaix (Germ. Pat. 61,329), the fat\r\nbeing heated in contact with the reagent for about nine hours at\r\n175 deg.-180 deg. C. under a pressure of some 18 atmospheres, but the process\r\ndoes not appear to be of any considerable importance.\r\n\r\n_Lime._--The use of lime for the saponification of oils and fats was\r\nfirst adopted on the technical scale for the production of candle-making\r\nmaterial, by De Milly in 1831. The insoluble lime soap formed is\r\ndecomposed by sulphuric acid, and the fatty acids steam distilled.\r\n\r\nThe amount of lime theoretically necessary to hydrolyse a given quantity\r\nof a triglyceride, ignoring for the moment any catalytic influence, can\r\nbe readily calculated; thus with stearin the reaction may be represented\r\nby the equation:--\r\n\r\n     CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{35}                                        CH_{2}OH\r\n     |                                                           |\r\n    2CHOOC_{18}H_{35} + 3Ca(OH)_{2} = 3Ca(OOC_{18}H_{35})_{2} + 2CHOH\r\n     |                                                           |\r\n     CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{35}                                        CH_{2}OH\r\n      stearin           milk of lime    calcium stearate         glycerol\r\n\r\nIn this instance, since the molecular weight of stearin is 890 and that\r\nof milk of lime is 74, it is at once apparent that for every 1,780 parts\r\nof stearin, 222 parts of milk of lime or 168 parts of quick-lime, CaO,\r\nwould be required. It is found in practice, however, that an excess of\r\n3-5 per cent. above the theoretical quantity of lime is necessary to\r\ncomplete the hydrolysis of a fat when carried on in an open vessel at\r\n100 deg.-105 deg. C., but that if the saponification be conducted under\r\npressure in autoclaves the amount of lime necessary to secure almost\r\nperfect hydrolysis is reduced to 2-3 per cent. on the fat, the treatment\r\nof fats with 3 per cent. of lime under a pressure of 10 atmospheres\r\nproducing a yield of 95 per cent. of fatty acids in seven hours. The\r\nlower the pressure in the autoclave, the lighter will be the colour of the\r\nresultant fatty acids.\r\n\r\n_Magnesia._--It has been proposed to substitute magnesia for lime in the\r\nprocess of saponification under pressure, but comparative experiments\r\nwith lime and magnesia, using 3 per cent. of lime and 2.7 per cent. of\r\nmagnesia (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, xii., 163), show that saponification\r\nby means of magnesia is less complete than with lime, and, moreover, the\r\nreaction requires a higher temperature and therefore tends to darken the\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n_Zinc Oxide._--The use of zinc oxide as accelerating agent has been\r\nsuggested by two or three observers. Poullain and Michaud, in 1882, were\r\ngranted a patent for this process, the quantity of zinc oxide\r\nrecommended to be added to the oil or fat being 0.2 to 0.5 per cent.\r\nRost, in 1903, obtained a French patent for the saponification of oils\r\nand fats by steam under pressure in the presence of finely divided\r\nmetals or metallic oxides, and specially mentions zinc oxide for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt has also been proposed to use zinc oxide in conjunction with lime in\r\nthe autoclave to obviate to some extent the discoloration of the fatty\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nOther catalytic agents have been recommended from time to time,\r\nincluding strontianite, lead oxide, caustic baryta, aluminium hydrate,\r\nbut none of these is of any practical importance.\r\n\r\n_Soda and Potash._--Unlike the preceding bases, the soaps formed by soda\r\nand potash are soluble in water, and constitute the soap of commerce.\r\nThese reagents are always used in sufficient quantity to combine with\r\nthe whole of the fatty acids contained in an oil or fat, though\r\ndoubtless, by the use of considerably smaller quantities, under\r\npressure, complete resolution of the fatty matter into fatty acids and\r\nglycerol could be accomplished. They are, by far, the most important\r\nsaponifying agents from the point of view of the present work, and their\r\npractical use is fully described in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRAW MATERIALS USED IN SOAP-MAKING.\r\n\r\n     _Fats and Oils--Waste Fats--Fatty Acids--Less-known Oils and\r\n     Fats of Limited Use--Various New Fats and Oils Suggested for\r\n     Soap-making--Rosin--Alkali (Caustic and\r\n     Carbonated)--Water--Salt--Soap-stock._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fats and Oils._--All animal and vegetable oils and fats intended for\r\nsoap-making should be as free as possible from unsaponifiable matter, of\r\na good colour and appearance, and in a sweet, fresh condition. The\r\nunsaponifiable matter naturally present as cholesterol, or phytosterol,\r\nranges in the various oils and fats from 0.2 to 2.0 per cent. All oils\r\nand fats contain more or less free acidity; but excess of acidity,\r\nthough it may be due to the decomposition of the glyceride, and does not\r\nalways denote rancidity, is undesirable in soap-making material.\r\nRancidity of fats and oils is entirely due to oxidation, in addition to\r\nfree acid, aldehydes and ketones being formed, and it has been proposed\r\nto estimate rancidity by determining the amount of these latter\r\nproduced. It is scarcely necessary to observe how very important it is\r\nthat the sampling of fats and oils should be efficiently performed, so\r\nthat the sample submitted to the chemist may be a fairly representative\r\naverage of the parcel.\r\n\r\nIn the following short description of the materials used, we give, under\r\neach heading, figures for typical samples of the qualities most suitable\r\nfor soap-making.\r\n\r\n_Tallows._--Most of the imported tallow comes from America, Australia\r\nand New Zealand. South American mutton tallow is usually of good\r\nquality; South American beef tallow is possessed of a deep yellow colour\r\nand rather strong odour, but makes a bright soap of a good body and\r\ntexture. North American tallows are, as a general rule, much paler in\r\ncolour than those of South America, but do not compare with them in\r\nconsistence. Most of the Australasian tallows are of very uniform\r\nquality and much in demand.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain produces large quantities of tallow which comes into the\r\nmarket as town and country tallow, or home melt. Owing to the increasing\r\ndemand for edible fat, much of the rough fat is carefully selected,\r\nrendered separately, and the product sold for margarine-making.\r\nConsequently the melted tallow for soap-making is of secondary\r\nimportance to the tallow melter.\r\n\r\nThe following are typical samples of tallow:--\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                                 |                |           |        |\r\n|                                 |                |  Acidity  |        |\r\n|                                 | Saponification | (as Oleic | Titre, |\r\n|                                 |   Equivalent.  |   Acid)   | deg.C. |\r\n|                                 |                | Per Cent. |        |\r\n|_________________________________|________________|___________|________|\r\n|                                 |                |           |        |\r\n| Australian mutton               |     285        |   0.85    |  45    |\r\n| Australian mutton               |     284.4      |   0.48    |  48.3  |\r\n| Australian beef                 |     284.2      |   1.68    |  43.9  |\r\n| Australian beef                 |     283.6      |   0.85    |  42.6  |\r\n| Australian mixed                |     285.1      |   3.52    |  44    |\r\n| Australian mixed                |     284.6      |   1.89    |  43.5  |\r\n| South American mutton           |     284.5      |   1.11    |  47    |\r\n| South American mutton           |     285        |   0.90    |  47.4  |\r\n| South American beef             |     284.7      |   0.81    |  45    |\r\n| South American beef             |     284        |   0.94    |  44    |\r\n| North American mutton           |     284.3      |   1.32    |  44    |\r\n| North American mutton           |      85        |   2.18    |  43.2  |\r\n| North American beef, fine       |     284.5      |   1.97    |  41.5  |\r\n| North American beef, good       |     283.8      |   4.30    |  42    |\r\n| North American ordinary         |     285.2      |   5.07    |  41.75 |\r\n| North American prime city       |     286        |   1.01    |  41.2  |\r\n| Selected English mutton         |     283.9      |   1.45    |  47    |\r\n| Selected English beef           |     284.2      |   2.40    |  44    |\r\n| Home-rendered or country tallow |     284.6      |   5.1     |  43    |\r\n| Town tallow                     |     285.3      |   7.4     |  42.5  |\r\n|_________________________________|________________|___________|________|\r\n\r\nTallow should absorb from 39 to 44 per cent. iodine.\r\n\r\n_Lard._--Lard is largely imported into this country from the United\r\nStates of America.

The gigantic forests of the United States\r\nconsist principally of the long-leaved pine, _Pinus palustris\r\n(Australis)_, whilst the French and Spanish oleo-resin is chiefly\r\nobtained from _Pinus pinaster_, which is largely cultivated.\r\n\r\nRosin is a brittle, tasteless, transparent substance having a smooth\r\nshining fracture and melting at about 135 deg. C. (275 deg. F.). The American\r\nvariety possesses a characteristic aromatic odour, which is lacking in\r\nthose from France and Spain. It is graded by samples taken out of the\r\ntop of every barrel, and cut into 7/8 of an inch cubes, which must be\r\nuniform in size--the shade of colour of the cube determines its grade\r\nand value.\r\n\r\nThe grades are as follows:--\r\n\r\n          W.

Na_{2}O due to this amounts to about 1\r\nper cent., may be obtained by adding this figure to the sodium oxide\r\nreally present.\r\n\r\n_Caustic soda_ (sodium hydrate) comes into commerce in a liquid form as\r\n90 deg. Tw. (and even as high as 106 deg. Tw.), and other degrees of dilution,\r\nand also in a solid form in various grades as 60 deg., 70 deg., 76-77 deg., 77-78 deg.\r\nThese degrees represent the percentage of sodium oxide (Na_{2}O) present\r\nplus the 1 per cent. The highest grade, containing as it does more\r\navailable caustic soda and less impurities, is much more advantageous in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of soda_ or _soda ash_, 58 deg., also termed \"light ash,\" and\r\n\"refined alkali\". This is a commercially pure sodium carbonate\r\ncontaining about 0.5 per cent. salt (NaCl). The 58 deg. represents the\r\nEnglish degrees and corresponds to 99 per cent. sodium carbonate\r\n(Na_{2}CO_{3}).\r\n\r\n_Soda ash_, 48 deg., sometimes called \"caustic soda ash,\" often contains\r\nbesides carbonate of soda, 4 per cent. caustic soda (sodium hydrate),\r\nand 10 per cent. salt (sodium chloride), together with water and\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\nThe 48 degrees refers to the amount of alkali present in terms of sodium\r\noxide (Na_{2}O), but expressed as English degrees.\r\n\r\n_Caustic potash_ (potassium hydrate) is offered as a liquid of 50-52 deg. B.\r\n(98-103 deg. Tw.) strength, and also in solid form as 75-80 deg. and 88-92 deg. The\r\ndegrees in the latter case refer to the percentage of potassium hydrate\r\n(KHO) actually present.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of Potash._--The standard for refined carbonate of potash is\r\n90-92 per cent. of actual potassium carbonate (K_{2}CO_{3}) present,\r\nalthough it can be obtained testing 95-98 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n_Water._--Water intended for use in soap-making should be as soft as\r\npossible. If the water supply is hard, it should be treated chemically;\r\nthe softening agents may be lime and soda ash together, soda ash alone,\r\nor caustic soda. There are many excellent plants in vogue for water\r\nsoftening, which are based on similar principles and merely vary in\r\nmechanical arrangement. The advantages accruing from the softening of\r\nhard water intended for steam-raising are sufficiently established and\r\nneed not be detailed here.\r\n\r\n_Salt_ (sodium chloride or common salt, NaCl) is a very important\r\nmaterial to the soap-maker, and is obtainable in a very pure state.\r\n\r\nBrine, or a saturated solution of salt, is very convenient in\r\nsoap-making, and, if the salt used is pure, will contain 26.4 per cent.\r\nsodium chloride and have a density of 41.6 deg. Tw. (24.8 deg. B.).\r\n\r\nThe presence of sulphates alters the density, and of course the sodium\r\nchloride content.\r\n\r\nSalt produced during the recovery of glycerine from the spent lyes often\r\ncontains sulphates, and the density of the brine made from this salt\r\nranges higher than 42 deg. Tw. (25 deg. B.).\r\n\r\n_Soapstock._--This substance is largely imported from America, where it\r\nis produced from the dark-coloured residue, termed mucilage, obtained\r\nfrom the refining of crude cotton-seed oil. Mucilage consists of\r\ncotton-seed oil soap, together with the colouring and resinous\r\nprinciples separated during the treatment of the crude oil. The\r\ncolouring matter is removed by boiling the mucilage with water and\r\ngraining well with salt; this treatment is repeated several times until\r\nthe product is free from excess of colour, when it is converted into\r\nsoap and a nigre settled out from it.\r\n\r\nSoapstock is sold on a fatty acid basis; the colour is variable.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[2] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[3] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[4] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[5] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[6] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[7] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[8] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[9] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[10] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[11] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n[12] Calculated by us from saponification value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBLEACHING AND TREATMENT OF RAW MATERIALS INTENDED FOR SOAP-MAKING.\r\n\r\n     _Palm Oil--Cotton-seed Oil--Cotton-seed \"Foots\"--Vegetable\r\n     Oils--Animal Fats--Bone Fat--Rosin._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving described the most important and interesting oils and fats used\r\nor suggested for use in the manufacture of soap, let us now consider\r\nbriefly the methods of bleaching and treating the raw materials, prior\r\nto their transference to the soap-pan.\r\n\r\n_Crude Palm Oil._--Of the various methods suggested for bleaching palm\r\noil, the bichromate process originated by Watts is undoubtedly the best.\r\nThe reaction may be expressed by the following equation, though in\r\npractice it is necessary to use twice the amount of acid required by\r\ntheory:--\r\n\r\n    K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 14HCl = 2KCl + Cr_{2}Cl_{6} + 7H_{2}O + 6Cl.\r\n\r\n    6Cl + 3H_{2}O = 6HCl + 3O.\r\n\r\nThe palm oil, freed from solid impurities by melting and subsidence, is\r\nplaced in the bleaching tank, and washed with water containing a little\r\nhydrochloric acid. Having allowed it to rest, and drawn off the liquor\r\nand sediment (chiefly sand), the palm oil is ready for treatment with\r\nthe bleaching reagent, which consists of potassium bichromate and\r\ncommercial muriatic acid. For every ton of oil, 22 to 28 lb. potassium\r\nbichromate and 45 to 60 lb. acid will be found sufficient to produce a\r\ngood bleached oil.\r\n\r\nThe best procedure is to act upon the colouring matter of the oil three\r\nsuccessive times, using in the first two treatments one-third of the\r\naverage of the figures just given, and in the final treatment an\r\nappropriate quantity which can be easily gauged by the appearance of a\r\ncooled sample of the oil.\r\n\r\nThe potassium bichromate is dissolved in hot water and added to the\r\ncrude palm oil, previously heated to 125 deg. F. (52 deg. C.), the requisite\r\namount of muriatic acid being then run in and the whole well agitated by\r\nmeans of air. The bright red colour of the oil gradually changes to dark\r\nbrown, and soon becomes green. The action having proceeded for a few\r\nminutes, agitation is stopped, and, after allowing to settle, the green\r\nliquor is withdrawn.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently bleached the oil is finally washed (without further\r\nheating) with hot water (which may contain salt), to remove the last\r\ntraces of chrome liquor.\r\n\r\nIf the above operation is carried out carefully, the colouring matter\r\nwill be completely oxidised.\r\n\r\nIt is important, however, that the temperature should not be allowed to\r\nrise above 130 deg. F. (54 deg. C.) during the bleaching of palm oil, otherwise\r\nthe resultant oil on saponification is apt to yield a soap of a \"foxy\"\r\ncolour. The bleached oil retains the characteristic violet odour of the\r\noriginal oil.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to use dilute sulphuric acid, or a mixture of this\r\nand common salt, in the place of muriatic acid in the above process.\r\n\r\n_Crude Cotton-seed Oil._--The deep colouring matter of crude cotton-seed\r\noil, together with the mucilaginous and resinous principles, are removed\r\nby refining with caustic soda lye.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of the refiner is to remove these impurities without\r\nsaponifying any of the neutral oil. The percentage of free fatty acids\r\nin the oil will determine the quantity of caustic lye required, which\r\nmust only be sufficient to remove this acidity.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the amount of free acidity, the quantity of caustic\r\nsoda lye necessary to neutralise it is diluted with water to 12 deg. or 15 deg.\r\nTw. (8 deg. or 10 deg. B.), and the refining process carried out in three\r\nstages. The oil is placed in a suitable tank and heated by means of a\r\nclosed steam coil to 100 deg. F. (38 deg. C.), a third of the necessary weak\r\ncaustic soda lye added in a fine stream or by means of a sprinkler, and\r\nthe whole well agitated with a mechanical agitator or by blowing a\r\ncurrent of air through a pipe laid on the bottom of the tank.\r\n\r\nProlonged agitation with air has a tendency to oxidise the oil, which\r\nincreases its specific gravity and refractive index, and will be found\r\nin the soap-pan to produce a reddish soap. As the treatment proceeds,\r\nthe temperature may be carefully raised, by means of the steam coil, to\r\n120 deg. F. (49 deg. C.).\r\n\r\nThe first treatment having proceeded fifteen minutes, the contents of\r\nthe tank are allowed to rest; the settling should be prolonged as much\r\nas possible, say overnight, to allow the impurities to precipitate well,\r\nand carry down the least amount of entangled oil. Having withdrawn these\r\ncoloured \"foots,\" the second portion of the weak caustic soda solution\r\nis agitated with the partially refined oil, and, when the latter is\r\nsufficiently treated, it is allowed to rest and the settled coloured\r\nliquor drawn off as before. The oil is now ready for the final\r\ntreatment, which is performed in the same manner as the two previous\r\nones. On settling, a clear yellow oil separates.\r\n\r\nIf desired, the oil may be brightened and filtered, after refining to\r\nproduce a marketable article, but if it is being refined for own use in\r\nthe soap-house, this may be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe residue or \"foots\" produced during the refining of crude\r\ncotton-seed oil, known in the trade as \"mucilage,\" may be converted into\r\n\"soapstock\" as mentioned in the preceding chapter, or decomposed by a\r\nmineral acid and made into \"black grease\" ready for distillation by\r\nsuperheated steam.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable Oils._--The other vegetable oils come to the soap-maker's\r\nhand in a refined condition; occasionally, however, it is desirable to\r\nremove a portion of the free fatty acids, which treatment also causes\r\nthe colouring matter to be preciptated. This is effected by bringing the\r\noil and a weak solution of caustic lye into intimate contact. Cocoa-nut\r\noil is often treated in this manner. Sometimes it is only necessary to\r\nwell agitate the oil with 1-1/2 per cent. of its weight of a 12 deg. Tw. (8 deg.\r\nB.) solution of caustic soda and allow to settle. The foots are utilised\r\nin the soap-pan.\r\n\r\n_Animal Fats._--Tallows are often greatly improved by the above alkaline\r\ntreatment at 165 deg. F. (73 deg. C.). It is one of the best methods and\r\npossesses advantages over acid processes--the caustic soda removes the\r\nfree acid and bodies of aldehyde nature, which are most probably the\r\nresult of oxidation or polymerisation, whereas the neutral fat is not\r\nattacked, and further, the alkaline foots can be used in the production\r\nof soap.\r\n\r\n_Bone fat_ often contains calcium (lime) salts, which are very\r\nobjectionable substances in a soap-pan. These impurities must be removed\r\nby a treatment with hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. The former acid is\r\npreferable, as the lime salt formed is readily soluble and easily\r\nremoved. The fat is agitated with a weak solution of acid in a\r\nlead-lined tank by blowing in steam, and when the treatment is complete\r\nand the waste liquor withdrawn, the last traces of acid are well washed\r\nout of the liquid fat with hot water.\r\n\r\n_Rosin._--Several methods have been suggested for bleaching rosin; in\r\nsome instances the constitution of the rosin is altered, and in others\r\nthe cost is too great or the process impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe aim of these processes must necessarily be the elimination of the\r\ncolouring matter without altering the original properties of the\r\nsubstance. This is best carried out by converting the rosin into a\r\nresinate of soda by boiling it with a solution of either caustic soda or\r\ncarbonated alkali. The process is commenced by heating 37 cwt. of 17 deg.\r\nTw. (11 deg. B.) caustic soda lye, and adding 20 cwt. of rosin, broken into\r\npieces, and continuing the boiling until all the resinate is\r\nhomogeneous, when an addition of 1-1/2 cwt. of salt is made and the\r\nboiling prolonged a little. On resting, the coloured liquor rises to the\r\nsurface of the resinate, and may be siphoned off (or pumped away through\r\na skimmer pipe) and the resinate further washed with water containing a\r\nlittle salt.\r\n\r\nThe treatment with carbonated alkali is performed in a similar manner. A\r\nsolution, consisting of 2-3/4 cwt. of soda ash (58 deg.), in about four\r\ntimes its weight of water, is heated and 20 cwt. of rosin, broken into\r\nsmall pieces, added. The whole is heated by means of the open steam\r\ncoil, and care must be taken to avoid boiling over. Owing to the\r\nliberation of CO_{2} gas, frothing takes place. A large number of\r\npatents have been granted for the preparation of resinate of soda, and\r\nmany methods devised to obviate the boiling over. Some suggest mixing\r\nthe rosin and soda ash (or only a portion of the soda ash) prior to\r\ndissolving in water; others saponify in a boiler connected with a trap\r\nwhich returns the resinate to the pan and allows the carbonic-acid gas\r\nto escape or to be collected.\r\n\r\nWith due precaution the method can be easily worked in open vessels,\r\nand, using the above proportions, there will be sufficient uncombined\r\nrosin remaining to allow the resultant product to be pumped into the\r\nsoap with which it is intended to intermix it, where it will be finally\r\nsaponified thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe salt required, which, in the example given, would be 1-1/2 cwt., may\r\nbe added to the solution prior to the addition of rosin or sprinkled in\r\ntowards the finish of the boiling. When the whole has been sufficiently\r\nboiled and allowed to rest, the liquor containing the colouring matter\r\nwill float over the resinate, and, after removal, may be replaced by\r\nanother washing.\r\n\r\nMany other methods have been suggested for the bleaching, refining and\r\ntreatment of materials intended for saponification, but the above\r\npractical processes are successfully employed.\r\n\r\nAll fats and oils after being melted by the aid of steam must be allowed\r\nto thoroughly settle, and the condensed water and impurities withdrawn\r\nthrough a trap arrangement for collecting the fatty matter. The molten\r\nsettled fatty materials _en route_ to the soap-pan should be passed\r\nthrough sieves sufficiently fine to free them from suspended matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSOAP-MAKING.\r\n\r\n     _Classification of Soaps--Direct Combination of Fatty Acids\r\n     with Alkali--Cold Process Soaps--Saponification under Increased\r\n     or Diminished Pressure--Soft Soap--Marine Soap--Hydrated Soaps,\r\n     Smooth and Marbled--Pasting or Saponification--Graining\r\n     Out--Boiling on Strength--Fitting--Curd Soaps--Curd\r\n     Mottled--Blue and Grey Mottled Soaps--Milling Base--Yellow\r\n     Household Soaps--Resting of Pans and Settling of\r\n     Soap--Utilisation of Nigres--Transparent Soaps--Saponifying\r\n     Mineral Oil--Electrical Production of Soap._\r\n\r\n\r\nSoaps are generally divided into two classes and designated \"hard,\" and\r\n\"soft,\" the former being the soda salts, and the latter potash salts, of\r\nthe fatty acids contained in the material used.\r\n\r\nAccording to their methods of manufacture, soaps may, however, be more\r\nconveniently classified, thus:--\r\n\r\n(A) Direct combination of fatty acids with alkali.\r\n\r\n(B) Treatment of fat with definite amount of alkali and no separation of\r\nwaste lye.\r\n\r\n(C) Treatment of fat with indefinite amount of alkali and no separation\r\nof waste lye.\r\n\r\n(D) Treatment of fat with indefinite amount of alkali and separation of\r\nwaste lye.\r\n\r\n(A) _Direct Combination of Fatty Acids with Alkali._--This method\r\nconsists in the complete saturation of fatty acids with alkali, and\r\npermits of the use of the deglycerised products mentioned in chapter\r\nii., section 2, and of carbonated alkalies or caustic soda or potash.\r\nFatty acids are readily saponified with caustic soda or caustic potash\r\nof all strengths.\r\n\r\nThe saponification by means of carbonated alkali may be performed in an\r\nopen vat containing a steam coil, or in a pan provided with a removable\r\nagitator.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to take soda ash (58 deg.), amounting to 19 per cent. of the\r\nweight of fatty acids to be saponified, and dissolve it in water by the\r\naid of steam until the density of the solution is 53 deg. Tw. (30 deg. B.); then\r\nbring to the boil, and, whilst boiling, add the molten fatty acids\r\nslowly, but not continuously.\r\n\r\nCombination takes place immediately with evolution of carbonic acid gas,\r\nwhich causes the contents of the vat or pan to swell, and frequently to\r\nboil over. The use of the agitator, or the cessation of the flow of\r\nfatty acids, will sometimes tend to prevent the boiling over. It is\r\nimperative that the steam should not be checked but boiling continued\r\nas vigorously as possible until all the alkali has been absorbed and the\r\ngas driven off.\r\n\r\nThe use of air to replace steam in expelling the carbonic acid gas has\r\nbeen patented (Fr. Pat. 333,974, 1903).\r\n\r\nA better method of procedure, however, is to commence with a solution of\r\n64 deg. Tw. (35 deg. B.) density, made from half the requisite soda ash (9-1/2\r\nper cent.), and when this amount of alkali has all been taken up by the\r\nfatty acids (which have been added gradually and with continuous\r\nboiling), the remaining quantity of soda ash is added in a dry state,\r\nbeing sprinkled over each further addition of fatty acid.\r\n\r\nThis allows the process to be more easily controlled and boiling over is\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the boiling by steam should be well maintained\r\nthroughout the process until all carbonic acid gas has been thoroughly\r\nexpelled; when that point is reached, the steam may be lessened and the\r\ncontents of the vat or pan gently boiled \"on strength\" with a little\r\ncaustic lye until it ceases to absorb caustic alkali, the soap being\r\nfinished in the manner described under (D).\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to prevent discoloration of fatty acids, hence\r\nthe products of saponification in this way do not compare favourably in\r\nappearance with those produced from the original neutral oil or fat.\r\n\r\n(B) _Treatment of Fat with Definite Amount of Alkali and no Separation\r\nof Waste Lye._--Cold-process soap is a type of this class, and its\r\nmethod of production is based upon the characteristic property which the\r\nglycerides of the lower fatty acids (members of the cocoa-nut-oil class)\r\npossess of readily combining with a strong caustic soda solution at a\r\nlow temperature, and evolving sufficient heat to complete the\r\nsaponification.\r\n\r\nSometimes tallow, lard, cotton-seed oil, palm oil and even castor oil\r\nare used in admixture with cocoa-nut oil. The process for such soap is\r\nthe same as when cocoa-nut oil is employed alone, with the slight\r\nalteration in temperature necessary to render the fats liquid, and the\r\namount of caustic lye required will be less. Soaps made of these blends\r\nclosely resemble, in appearance, milled toilet soaps. In such mixtures\r\nthe glycerides of the lower fatty acids commence the saponification, and\r\nby means of the heat generated induce the other materials, which alone\r\nwould saponify with difficulty or only with the application of heat, to\r\nfollow suit.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to use high grade materials; the oils and fats should be\r\nfree from excess of acidity, to which many of the defects of\r\ncold-process soaps may be traced. Owing to the rapidity with which free\r\nacidity is neutralised by caustic soda, granules of soap are formed,\r\nwhich in the presence of strong caustic lye are \"grained out\" and\r\ndifficult to remove without increasing the heat; the soap will thus tend\r\nto become thick and gritty and sometimes discoloured.\r\n\r\nThe caustic lye should be made from the purest caustic soda, containing\r\nas little carbonate as possible; the water used for dissolving or\r\ndiluting the caustic soda should be soft (_i.e._, free from calcium and\r\nmagnesium salts), and all the materials carefully freed from particles\r\nof dirt and fibre by straining.\r\n\r\nThe temperature, which, of course, must vary with the season, should be\r\nas low as is consistent with fluidity, and for cocoa-nut oil alone may\r\nbe 75 deg. F. (24 deg. C.), but in mixtures containing tallow 100 deg. to 120 deg. F.\r\n(38 deg. to 49 deg. C.).\r\n\r\nThe process is generally carried out as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe fluid cocoa-nut oil is stirred in a suitable vessel with half its\r\nweight of 71.4 deg. Tw. (38 deg. B.) caustic soda lye at the same temperature,\r\nand, when thoroughly mixed, the pan is covered and allowed to rest. It\r\nis imperative that the oils and fats and caustic lye should be\r\nintimately incorporated or emulsified. The agitating may be done\r\nmechanically, there being several machines specially constructed for the\r\npurpose. In one of the latest designs the caustic lye is delivered\r\nthrough a pipe which rotates with the stirring gear, and the whole is\r\ndriven by means of a motor.\r\n\r\nThe agitation being complete, chemical action takes place with the\r\ngeneration of heat, and finally results in the saponification of the\r\nfats.\r\n\r\nAt first the contents of the pan are thin, but in a few hours they\r\nbecome a solid mass. As the process advances the edges of the soap\r\nbecome more transparent, and when the transparency has extended to the\r\nwhole mass, the soap is ready, after perfuming, to be framed and\r\ncrutched.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of a little caustic potash with the caustic soda greatly\r\nimproves the appearance of the resultant product, which is smoother and\r\nmilder.\r\n\r\nThe glycerine liberated during the saponification is retained in the\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is possible, with care, to produce neutral soaps of good\r\nappearance and firm touch by this method, cold-process soaps are very\r\nliable to contain both free alkali and unsaponified fat, and have now\r\nfallen considerably into disrepute.\r\n\r\n_Saponification under Increased or Diminished Pressure._--Soaps made by\r\nboiling fats and oils, under pressure and _in vacuo_, with the exact\r\nquantity of caustic soda necessary for complete combination, belong also\r\nto this class. Amongst the many attempts which have at various times\r\nbeen made to shorten the process of soap-making may be mentioned\r\nHaywood's Patent No. 759, 1901, and Jourdan's French Patent No. 339,154,\r\n1903.\r\n\r\nIn the former, saponification is carried out in a steam-jacketed vacuum\r\nchamber provided with an elaborate arrangement of stirrers; in the other\r\nprocess fat is allowed to fall in a thin stream into the amount of lye\r\nrequired for saponification, previously placed in the saponification\r\nvessel, which is provided with stirring gear.\r\n\r\nWhen the quantities have been added, steam is admitted and\r\nsaponification proceeds.\r\n\r\n(C) _Treatment of Fat with Indefinite Amount of Alkali and no Separation\r\nof Waste Lye._--_Soft soap_ is representative of this class. The\r\nvegetable fluid oils (linseed, olive, cotton-seed, maize) are for the\r\nmost part used in making this soap, though occasionally bone fats and\r\ntallow are employed. Rosin is sometimes added, the proportion ranging,\r\naccording to the grade of soap required, from 5 to 15 per cent. of the\r\nfatty matter.\r\n\r\nThe Soft Soap Manufacturers' Convention of Holland stipulate that the\r\nmaterials used in soft-soap making must not contain more than 5 per\r\ncent. rosin; it is also interesting to note that a patent has been\r\ngranted (Eng. Pat. 17,278, 1900) for the manufacture of soft soap from\r\nmaterial containing 50 per cent. rosin.\r\n\r\nFish or marine animal oils--whale, seal, etc., once largely used as raw\r\nmaterial for soft soap, have been superseded by vegetable oils.\r\n\r\nThe materials must be varied according to the season; during hot\r\nweather, more body with a less tendency to separate is given by the\r\nintroduction of oils and fats richer in stearine; these materials also\r\ninduce \"figging\".\r\n\r\nThe most important material, however, is the caustic potash lye which\r\nshould average 40 deg. Tw. (24 deg. B.), _i.e._, if a weak solution is used to\r\ncommence saponification, a stronger lye must be afterwards employed to\r\navoid excess of water in the soap, and these average 40 deg. Tw. (24 deg. B.).\r\nThe potash lye must contain carbonates, which help to give transparency\r\nto the resultant soap. If the lye is somewhat deficient in carbonates,\r\nthey may be added in the form of a solution of refined pearl ash\r\n(potassium carbonate).\r\n\r\nCaustic soda lye is sometimes admixed, to the extent of one-fourth, with\r\npotash lye to keep the soap firmer during hot weather, but it requires\r\ngreat care, as a slight excess of soda gives soft soap a bad appearance\r\nand a tendency to separate.\r\n\r\nThe process is commenced by running fatty matter and weak potash lyes\r\ninto the pan or copper, and boiling together, whilst the introduction of\r\noil and potash lye is continued.\r\n\r\nThe saponification commences when an emulsion forms, and the lye is then\r\nrun in more quickly to prevent the mass thickening.\r\n\r\nHaving added sufficient \"strength\" for complete saponification, the\r\nboiling is continued until the soap becomes clear.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the soap is judged by observing the behaviour of a\r\nsmall sample taken from the pan and dropped on glass or iron. If the\r\nsoap is satisfactory it will set firm, have a short texture and slightly\r\nopaque edge, and be quite clear when held towards the light. If the\r\ncooled sample draws out in threads, there is an excess of water present.\r\nIf an opaque edge appears and vanishes, the soap requires more lye. If\r\nthe sample is turbid and somewhat white, the soap is too alkaline and\r\nneeds more oil.\r\n\r\nThe glycerine liberated during saponification is contained in the soap\r\nand no doubt plays a part in the production of transparency.\r\n\r\n_Hydrated soaps_, both smooth and marbled, are included in this\r\nclassification, but are _soda_ soaps. Soap made from cocoa-nut oil and\r\npalm-kernel oil will admit of the incorporation of large quantities of a\r\nsolution of either salt, carbonate of soda, or silicate of soda, without\r\nseparation, and will retain its firmness. These materials are,\r\ntherefore, particularly adapted for the manufacture of marine soaps,\r\nwhich often contain as much as 80 per cent. of water, and, being soluble\r\nin brine, are capable of use in sea-water. For the same reason,\r\ncocoa-nut oil enters largely into the constitution of hydrated soaps,\r\nbut the desired yield or grade of soap allows of a variation in the\r\nchoice of materials. Whilst marine soap, for example, is usually made\r\nfrom cocoa-nut oil or palm-kernel oil only, a charge of 2/3 cocoa-nut\r\noil and 1/3 tallow, or even 2/3 tallow and 1/3 cocoa-nut oil, will\r\nproduce a paste which can carry the solutions of silicate, carbonate,\r\nand salt without separation, and yield a smooth, firm soap.\r\n\r\nThe fatty materials, carefully strained and freed from particles of dirt\r\nand fibre, are boiled with weak caustic soda lye until combination has\r\ntaken place. Saponification being complete, the solution of salt is\r\nadded, then the carbonate of soda solution, and finally the silicate of\r\nsoda solution, after which the soap is boiled. When thoroughly mixed,\r\nsteam is shut off, and the soap is ready for framing.\r\n\r\nThe marbled hydrated soap is made from cocoa-nut oil or a mixture of\r\npalm-kernel oil and cocoa-nut oil with the aid of caustic soda lye\r\n32-1/2 deg. Tw. (20 deg. B.). As soon as saponification is complete, the brine\r\nand carbonate of soda solution are added, and the pan allowed to rest.\r\n\r\nThe soap is then carefully tasted as to its suitability for marbling by\r\ntaking samples and mixing with the colouring solution (ultramarine mixed\r\nwith water or silicate of soda solution). If the sample becomes blue\r\nthroughout, the soap is too alkaline; if the colour is precipitated, the\r\nsoap is deficient in alkali. The right point has been reached when the\r\nmarbling is distributed evenly. Having thus ascertained the condition of\r\nthe pan, and corrected it if necessary, the colour, mixed in water or in\r\nsilicate of soda solution, is added and the soap framed.\r\n\r\n(D) _Treatment of Fat with Indefinite Amount of Alkali and Separation of\r\nWaste Lye._--This is the most general method of soap-making. The various\r\noperations are:--\r\n\r\n          (_a_) Pasting or saponification.\r\n          (_b_) Graining out or separation.\r\n          (_c_) Boiling on strength.\r\n\r\nAnd in the case of milling soap base and household soaps,\r\n\r\n          (_d_) Fitting.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Pasting or Saponification._--The melted fats and oils are\r\nintroduced into the soap-pan and boiled by means of open steam with a\r\ncaustic soda lye 14 deg. to 23.5 deg. Tw. (10 deg. to 15 deg. B.). Whether the fatty\r\nmatters and alkali are run into the pan simultaneously or separately is\r\nimmaterial, provided the alkali is not added in sufficient excess to\r\nretard the union.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the saponification is denoted by the formation of an\r\nemulsion. Sometimes it is difficult to start the saponification; the\r\npresence of soap will often assist this by emulsifying the fat and thus\r\nbringing it into intimate contact with the caustic soda solution.\r\n\r\nWhen the action has started, caustic soda lye of a greater density, 29 deg.\r\nto 33 deg. Tw. (18 deg. to 20 deg. B.), is frequently added, with continued boiling,\r\nin small quantities as long as it is being absorbed, which is\r\nascertained by taking out samples from time to time and examining them.\r\n\r\nThere should be no greasiness in the sample, but when pressed between\r\nfinger and thumb it must be firm and dry.\r\n\r\nBoiling is continued until the faint caustic taste on applying the\r\ncooled sample to the tongue is permanent, when it is ready for \"graining\r\nout\". The pasty mass now consists of the soda salts of the fat (as\r\nimperfect soap, probably containing emulsified diglycerides and\r\nmonoglycerides), together with water, in which is dissolved the\r\nglycerine formed by the union of the liberated glyceryl radicle from the\r\nfat with the hydroxyl radicle of the caustic soda, and any slight excess\r\nof caustic soda and carbonates. The object of the next operation is to\r\nseparate this water (spent lye) from the soap.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Graining Out or Separation._--This is brought about by the use of\r\ncommon salt, in a dry form or in solution as brine, or by caustic soda\r\nlye. Whilst the soap is boiling, the salt is spread uniformly over its\r\nsurface, or brine 40 deg. Tw. (24 deg. B.) is run in, and the whole well boiled\r\ntogether. The soap must be thoroughly boiled after each addition of\r\nsalt, and care taken that too large a quantity is not added at once.\r\n\r\nAs the soap is gradually thrown out of solution, it loses its smooth\r\ntransparent appearance, and becomes opaque and granular.\r\n\r\nWhen a sample, taken out on a wooden trowel, consists of distinct grains\r\nof soap and a liquid portion, which will easily separate, sufficient\r\nsalt or brine has been added; the boiling is stopped and the spent lye\r\nallowed to settle out, whilst the soap remains on the surface as a more\r\nor less thick mass.\r\n\r\nThe separated spent lye consists of a solution of common salt,\r\nglycerine, and alkaline salts; the preparation of crude glycerine\r\ntherefrom is considered in chapter ix.\r\n\r\nThe degree of separation of water (spent lye) depends upon the amount of\r\nprecipitant used. The aim is to obtain a maximum amount of spent lye\r\nseparated by the use of a minimum quantity of salt.\r\n\r\nThe amount of salt required for \"graining out\" varies with the raw\r\nmaterial used. A tallow soap is the most easily grained, more salt is\r\nrequired for cotton-seed oil soap, whereas soaps made from cocoa-nut and\r\npalm-kernel oils require very large amounts of salt to grain out\r\nthoroughly. Owing to the solubility in weak brine of these latter soaps,\r\nit is preferable to grain them with caustic soda lye. This is effected\r\nby adding, during boiling, sufficient caustic lye (32-1/2 deg. Tw., 20 deg. B.)\r\nto produce the separation of the granules of soap. The whole is allowed\r\nto rest; the separated half-spent lye is withdrawn and may be used for\r\nthe pasting of fresh materials.\r\n\r\nAfter the removal of the settled lye, the grained mass is boiled with\r\nsufficient water to dissolve the grain and make it smooth (\"close\" it),\r\nand is now ready for the next operation of \"boiling on strength\".\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Boiling on Strength or Clear Boiling._--This is the most\r\nimportant operation and is often termed \"making the soap\". The object is\r\nto harden the soap and to ensure complete saponification.\r\n\r\nCaustic soda lye (32-1/2 deg. Tw., 20 deg. B.) is gradually added until the soap\r\nis again opened or grained, and boiling continued by the use of the dry\r\nsteam coil. As soon as the caustic soda lye is absorbed, another portion\r\nis slowly added, and this is continued until the caustic soda or\r\n\"strength\" remains permanent and the soapy mass, refusing to absorb\r\nmore, is thrown out of solution and grained. The granular mass will boil\r\nsteadily, and the boiling should be prolonged, as the last traces of\r\nneutral oil are difficult to completely saturate with alkali. Thorough\r\nsaponification takes place gradually, and the operation cannot be\r\nhurried; special care has to be bestowed upon this operation to effect\r\nthe complete combination of fat and alkali.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for several hours, half-spent lye settles to the bottom of\r\nthe pan. In the case of yellow soaps or milling bases the settled lye is\r\nremoved to a suitable receptacle and reserved for use in the\r\nsaponification of other material, and the soap is then ready for the\r\nfinal operation of \"fitting\".\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Fitting._--If the operations just described have been properly\r\nperformed, the fitting should present no difficulty. The soap is boiled\r\nwith open steam, and water added until the desired degree of closing is\r\nattained. As the water is thoroughly intermixed throughout the mass the\r\nthick paste gradually becomes reduced to a smooth, thin consistence.\r\nSamples are tested from time to time as to their behaviour in dropping\r\noff a hot trowel held sideways; the thin layer should drop off in two or\r\nthree flakes and leave the surface of the trowel clean and dry. The soap\r\nis then in a condition to allow the impurities to gravitate. According\r\nto the required soap, the fit may be \"coarse\" (\"open\") when the flakes\r\ndrop off the trowel readily, or \"fine\" (\"close\") when the flakes only\r\nleave the trowel with difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf the dilution with water has been allowed to proceed too far, and too\r\nfine a fit is produced, which would be denoted by the layer of soap not\r\nleaving the trowel, a little caustic lye or brine may be very carefully\r\nadded and the whole well boiled until the desired condition is obtained.\r\n\r\nA good pressure of steam is now applied to the pan, causing the contents\r\nto swell as high as possible, this greatly facilitating the settling of\r\nimpurities; steam is then turned off, the pan covered, and the boil\r\nallowed to rest for several days.\r\n\r\nThe art of fitting consists in leaving the contents of the pan in such a\r\ncondition that, on standing, all the impurities precipitate, and the\r\nsettled soap, containing the correct amount of water, is clear and\r\nbright.\r\n\r\nThe above is a general practical outline of the ordinary soap-boiling\r\nprocess. It may be modified or slightly altered according to the fancy\r\nof the individual soap-maker or the particular material it is desired to\r\nuse. Fats and oils not only vary in the amount of alkali they absorb\r\nduring saponification, but also differ in the strength of the alkali\r\nthey require. Tallow and palm oil require lye of a density of 15 deg. to 18 deg.\r\nTw. (10 deg. to 12 deg. B.), but cocoa-nut oil alone would not saponify unless\r\nthe lye was more concentrated, 33 deg. to 42 deg. Tw. (20 deg. to 25 deg. B.).\r\nCotton-seed oil requires weak lyes for saponification, and, being\r\ndifficult to saponify alone even with prolonged boiling, is generally\r\nmixed with animal fat.\r\n\r\nWhen fats are mixed together, however, their varying alkali requirements\r\nbecome modified, and once the saponification is begun with weak lye,\r\nother materials are induced to take up alkali of a strength with which\r\nalone they would not combine.\r\n\r\nIt is considered the best procedure to commence the pasting or\r\nsaponification with weak lye.\r\n\r\nIn order to economise tank space, it is the general practice to store\r\nstrong caustic lye (60 deg. to 70 deg. Tw., 33 deg. to 37 deg. B.) and to dilute it as\r\nit is being added to the soap-pan by the simultaneous addition of water.\r\n\r\nMany manufacturers give all their soap a \"brine wash\" to remove the last\r\ntraces of glycerine and free the soap from carbonates. This operation\r\ntakes place prior to \"fitting\"; sufficient water is added to the boiling\r\nsoap to \"close\" it and then brine is run in to \"grain\" it.\r\n\r\nAfter resting, the liquor is withdrawn.\r\n\r\nHaving described the necessary operations in general, we will now\r\nconsider their application to the preparation of various kinds of hard\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\n_Curd Soaps._--Tallow is largely used in the manufacture of white curd\r\nsoaps, but cocoa-nut oil sometimes enters into their composition.\r\n\r\nThe first three operations above described, _viz._, pasting, graining\r\nout, and boiling on strength, are proceeded with; the clear boiling by\r\nmeans of a closed steam coil is continued until the \"head\" is boiled out\r\nand the soap is free from froth. A sample taken and cooled should be\r\nhard. Boiling is then stopped, and, after covering, the pan is allowed\r\nto rest for eight to ten hours, when the soap is ready for filling into\r\nframes, where it is crutched until perfectly smooth.\r\n\r\n_Curd mottled_ is usually made from melted kitchen stuff and bone\r\ngrease.\r\n\r\nIts preparation is substantially the same as for curd soap, but the\r\nclear boiling is not carried so far. The art of curd mottled soap-making\r\nlies in the boiling. If boiled too long the mottling will not form\r\nproperly, and, on the other hand, insufficient boiling will cause the\r\nsoap to contain an excess of entangled lye. Having boiled it to its\r\ncorrect concentration the pan is allowed to rest about two hours, after\r\nwhich the soap is ready for framing, which should be done expeditiously\r\nand the frames covered up.\r\n\r\nSome lye, containing the impurities from the fats used, remains in the\r\ninterstices of the curd, unable to sink, and as the soap cools it is\r\nenclosed and forms the mottling. The mottling may, therefore, be\r\nconsidered as a crystallisation of the soap, in which the impurity forms\r\nthe colour.\r\n\r\n_Blue and Grey Mottled Soaps._--These are silicated or liquored soaps in\r\nwhich the natural mottling, due to the impure materials used in the\r\nearly days of soap-making, is imitated by artificial mottling, and are,\r\nconsequently, entirely different to curd mottled soaps.\r\n\r\nThe materials employed in making mottled soap comprise bleached palm\r\noil, tallow, bone fat, cocoa-nut oil, palm-kernel oil, cotton-seed oil,\r\nand, in some instances, rosin.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a charge will naturally depend upon the cost; the property\r\nof absorbing a large amount of liquor, which is characteristic of soaps\r\nmade from cocoa-nut oil and palm-kernel oil, is taken advantage of, as\r\nare also the physical properties of the various fats and oils, with a\r\nview to the crystallisation of the resultant soap and the development of\r\nthe mottle. The fat is saponified, grained and boiled on strength, as\r\npreviously described. After withdrawing the half-spent lye, the soap is\r\njust closed by boiling with water, and is then ready for the silicate or\r\nother saline additions.\r\n\r\nSoap intended to be liquored with silicate of soda should be distinctly\r\nstrong in free alkali; the crystalline nature of the soap is increased\r\nthereby, and the mottled effect intensified. Some makers, however, fit\r\nthe soap coarsely and allow a nigre to deposit; then, after removing the\r\nnigre, or transferring the settled soap to another copper, containing\r\nscraps of mottled soap, get the soap into a condition for mottling, and\r\nadd the silicate of soda solution. To every 1 cwt. of soap, 28 lb. of\r\nsilicate of soda solution, 32-1/2 deg. Tw. (20 deg. B.) is added, whilst\r\nboiling; the strength of the silicate solution, however, will depend\r\nupon the proportion of cocoa-nut oil and palm-kernel oil present in the\r\ncharge. Many soap-makers use 20 deg. Tw. (13 deg. B.) (cold) silicate solution,\r\nwhilst others prefer 140 deg. Tw. (59.5 deg. B.), with the gradual addition of\r\nwater to the soap, kept boiling, until the product is in the correct\r\nmottling condition, and others, again, use bleach liquor, soda crystals,\r\npearl ash, and salt, together with silicate solution.\r\n\r\nConsiderable skill and experience is necessary to discern when the soap\r\nacquires the correct mottling state. It should drop off the spatula in\r\nlarge thick flakes, take considerable time to set, and the surface\r\nshould not be glossy.\r\n\r\nWhen this mottling condition has been obtained, the colouring matter,\r\nwhich would be ultramarine for the blue mottled and manganese dioxide\r\nfor the grey mottled soap (3-4 lb. ultramarine or 1-3 lb. manganese\r\ndioxide being sufficient for 1 ton of soap), is mixed with a little\r\nwater and added to the boiling soap--the boiling is continued until all\r\nis thoroughly amalgamated, and when the steam is shut off the contents\r\nof the pan are ready for cleansing.\r\n\r\nMottled soap is run into wooden frames, which, when full, are covered\r\nover and allowed to cool very gradually. On cooling slowly, large\r\ncrystals are produced which result in a distinct bold mottle; if the\r\ncooling is too rapid, a small crystal is obtained and the mottle is not\r\ndistributed, resulting in either a small mottle, or no mottle at all,\r\nand merely a general coloration. In fact, the entire art of mottling\r\nsoap consists in properly balancing the saline solutions and colouring\r\nmatter, so that the latter is properly distributed throughout the soap,\r\nand does not either separate in coloured masses at the bottom of the\r\nframe, or uniformly colour the whole mass.\r\n\r\nA sample of the soap should test 45 per cent. fatty acids, and the\r\namount of salt would range from 1/2 to 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nSome of the English mottled soaps, especially those made from materials\r\nwhich give a yellow-coloured ground, are bleached by soaking in brine,\r\nor pickling in brine containing 2 per cent. of bleach liquor. The\r\nresultant soap has a white ground and is firm. The bleach liquor may be\r\nmade by mixing 1 cwt. bleaching powder with 10 cwts. of soda ash\r\nsolution (15 deg. Tw., 10 deg. B.), allowing to settle, and using the clear\r\nliquid, or by mixing 2 parts soda ash solution with 1 part of bleaching\r\npowder solution, both solutions being 30 deg. Tw. (18.8 deg. B.).\r\n\r\n_Milling-base._--The materials generally used are tallows and cocoa-nut\r\noils of the finest quality. The tallow is thoroughly saponified first,\r\nand the graining is performed by the aid of caustic soda lye in\r\npreference to salt. The half-spent lyes are withdrawn, and the cocoa-nut\r\noil added to the pan. This is saponified, and when the saponification is\r\ncomplete, \"boiling-on-strength\" is proceeded with. Special care should\r\nbe devoted to the \"boiling-on-strength\" operation--its value in good\r\nsoap-making cannot be over-rated--and perfect saponification must be\r\nensured. The half-spent lyes are allowed to deposit during the night,\r\nand the soap must be carefully examined next morning to ascertain if any\r\nalkali has been absorbed. If the caustic taste is permanent the\r\nstrengthening operation is complete, but should any caustic have been\r\nabsorbed, further addition of alkali must be made and the boiling\r\ncontinued. These remarks apply equally to all soaps.\r\n\r\nThe soap, when ready, is fitted.\r\n\r\nBleached palm oil, olive oil, castor oil and lard are also employed in\r\nthe production of special milling soap bases, a palm oil soap being\r\nspecially suitable for the production of a violet-scented toilet soap.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Household Soaps._ (_a_) _Bar Soaps._--These are made from tallow\r\nwith an admixture of from 15-25 per cent. rosin. The best quality is\r\nknown in the South and West of England as Primrose Soap, but is\r\ndesignated in the North of England by such names as Golden Pale,\r\nImperial Pale, Gold Medal Pale, etc. Tallow alone produces a very hard\r\nsoap of inferior lathering qualities; but rosin combines with alkali to\r\nform a soft body, which, although not a soap in the strict sense of the\r\nterm, is readily soluble in water, and in admixture with the durable\r\ntallow soap renders it more soluble in water and thereby increases its\r\nlathering properties.\r\n\r\nThe rosin may be added to the soap-pan after a previous partial\r\nsaponification with soda ash, and removal of colouring matter, and\r\nfinally saponified with caustic soda lye, or, as is more generally\r\nadopted, as a rosin change. The pan is opened with caustic soda lye and\r\nsaturation of the rosin takes place rapidly; when completely saponified\r\nit is grained with salt, and the coloured lye allowed to deposit and\r\nfinally withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe four operations already detailed apply to this soap.\r\n\r\nCheaper pale soaps may be made from lower grades of tallow and rosin and\r\nare generally silicated.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Tablet or Washer Type._--A demand has arisen for soap of free\r\nlathering qualities, which has become very popular for general household\r\nuse. This soap is usually made from a mixture of cotton-seed oil,\r\ntallow, and cocoa-nut oil, with a varying amount of rosin. The tallow\r\nyields firmness and durability whilst the other constituents all assist\r\nin the more ready production of a copious lather.\r\n\r\nAs to what amount of rosin can be used to yield a finished soap of\r\nsufficient body and satisfactory colour, this naturally depends upon the\r\ngrade of raw material at the soap-makers' disposal. Those fats and oils\r\nwhich yield firm soaps, will, of course, allow a greater proportion of\r\nrosin to be incorporated with them than materials producing soaps of\r\nless body. Rosin imparts softness to a soap, and also colour.\r\n\r\nThis is a fitted soap and full details of manufacture have already been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nCheaper soaps are produced from lower grade materials hardened with\r\nalkaline solutions.\r\n\r\n_Resting of Pans and Settling of Soap._--The fitted soap is allowed to\r\nsettle from four to six days. The period allowed for resting is\r\ninfluenced, however, not only by the size of the boil, and the season,\r\nbut also by the composition of the soap, for if the base has been made\r\nfrom firm stock it is liable to cool quicker than a soap produced from\r\nsoft-bodied materials.\r\n\r\nOn subsidence, the contents of the pan will have divided into the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nFirst. On top, a thin crust of soap, with perhaps a little light\r\ncoloured fob, which is returned to the pan after the removal of the good\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\nSecond. The good settled soap, testing 62-63 per cent. fatty acids. The\r\nsubject of removing and treatment of this layer is fully dealt with in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nThird. A layer of darker weak soap, termed \"nigre,\" which on an average\r\ntests 33 per cent. fatty acids, and, according to the particular fit\r\nemployed, will amount to from 15-20 per cent. of the total quantity of\r\nsoap in the pan.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of nigre may vary not only with the amount of water added\r\nduring finishing, but is also influenced by the amount of caustic alkali\r\nremaining in the soap paste prior to fitting. If the free caustic\r\nalkali-content is high, the soap will require a large amount of water to\r\nattain the desired fit. This water renders the caustic into a lye\r\nsufficiently weak to dissolve a quantity of soap, consequently, as the\r\n\"nigre\" is a weak solution of soap together with any excess of alkali\r\n(caustic or carbonate) and salt which gravitates during the settling,\r\nthe quantity is increased.\r\n\r\nFourth. A solution containing alkaline salts, mostly carbonates and\r\nchlorides, with a little caustic.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the layer is very variable, and doubtless, under certain\r\nphysical conditions, this liquor has separated from the nigre.\r\n\r\n_Utilisation of Nigres._--The nigres are boiled and the liquor separated\r\nby graining with salt. Nigre may be utilised in various ways.\r\n\r\n(1) It may be used several times with new materials. This particularly\r\nrefers to soaps of the \"Washer\" type. The colour of the nigre will\r\ndetermine the number of times it can be employed.\r\n\r\n(2) It may be incorporated with a soap of a lower grade than the one\r\nfrom which it was obtained. In this case a system is generally adopted;\r\nfor example, soap of the best quality is made in a clean pan, the nigre\r\nremaining is worked up with fresh material for soap of the next quality,\r\nthe nigre from that boil, in its turn, is admixed with a charge to\r\nproduce a batch of third quality, and the deposited nigre from this is\r\nagain used for a fourth quality soap--the nigre obtained from this\r\nlatter boil would probably be transferred into the cheapened \"washer\" or\r\nperhaps if it was dark in colour into the brown soap-pan.\r\n\r\n(3) The nigre may be fitted and produce a soap similar to the original\r\nsoap from which it was deposited. It is advisable to saponify a little\r\nfat with it.\r\n\r\n(4) Nigres from several boils of the same kind of soap can be collected,\r\nboiled, and fitted. The settled portion may be incorporated with a new\r\ncharging to keep the resultant soap uniform in colour--unless this is\r\ndone, the difference in colour between boils from new materials alone,\r\nand those containing nigre, is very noticeable. The nigre settled from\r\nthis fitted nigre boil would be utilised in brown soap.\r\n\r\n(5) According to its colour, and consistence, a nigre may be suitable\r\nfor the production of disinfectant, or cold-water soaps.\r\n\r\n(6) Nigre may be bleached by treatment with a 20 per cent. solution of\r\nstannous chloride--1 cwt. of this solution (previously heated) is\r\nsufficient to bleach 20 tons of nigre.\r\n\r\n_Transparent Soaps._--The production of transparent soaps has recently\r\nbeen fully studied, from a theoretical point of view, by Richardson\r\n(_J. Amer. Chem. Soc._, 1908, pp. 414-20), who concludes that the\r\nfunction of substances inducing transparency, is to produce a jelly and\r\nretard crystallisation.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned transparent soap is prepared by dissolving, previously\r\ndried, genuine yellow soap in alcohol, and allowing the insoluble saline\r\nimpurities to be deposited and removed. The alcoholic soap solution is\r\nthen placed in a distillation apparatus, or the pan containing the\r\nsolution is attached by means of a still head to a condenser, and the\r\nalcohol distilled, condensed and regained. The remaining liquid soap,\r\nwhich may be coloured and perfumed, is run into frames and allowed to\r\nsolidify.\r\n\r\nThe resultant mass is somewhat turbid, but after storage in a room at\r\n95 deg. F. (35 deg. C.) for several months, becomes transparent.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the transparency is sometimes assisted and hastened by\r\nthe addition of glycerine or a solution of cane-sugar.\r\n\r\nA patent has been granted to A. Ruch (Fr. Pat. 327,293, 1902) for the\r\nmanufacture of transparent glycerine soap by heating in a closed vessel\r\nfatty acids together with the requisite quantity of alcoholic caustic\r\nsoda solution necessary for saponification, and cooling the resultant\r\nsoap. It is also proposed to add sugar solution.\r\n\r\nCheaper qualities of transparent soaps are made by the cold process with\r\nor without the aid of alcohol and castor oil, and with the assistance of\r\nglycerine or cane-sugar.\r\n\r\nWith the continual demand for cheaper production, sugar solution has\r\ngradually, in conjunction with castor oil, which produces transparency,\r\nsuperseded the use of alcohol and glycerine.\r\n\r\nFor a small batch, 56 lb. Cochin cocoa-nut oil and 56 lb. sweet edible\r\ntallow may be taken, melted at 130 deg. F. (54 deg. C.), and carefully strained\r\ninto a small steam-jacketed pan. It is imperative that the materials\r\nshould be of the highest quality and perfectly clean. Twenty-three lb.\r\nof pure glycerine and 56 lb. of bright caustic soda solution made from\r\nhigh grade caustic and having a density of 72 deg. Tw. (38 deg. B.) are crutched\r\ninto the fat; the alcohol, which would be 45 lb. in this example, is\r\nthen added. The whole must be most intimately incorporated, and the pan\r\ncovered and allowed to rest for one hour or one and a half hours.\r\nSaponification should ensue.\r\n\r\nTo produce a transparent glycerine soap with the aid of castor oil, and\r\nwith or without the use of alcohol, the following is the procedure:--\r\n\r\nCochin cocoa-nut oil, sweet edible tallow, and castor oil, of each 56\r\nlb. are taken, warmed to 130 deg. F. (54 deg. C.), and carefully strained into\r\nthe jacketed pan. If it is desired to use glycerine and cane sugar\r\nsolution, and no alcohol, the glycerine (25 lb.) is now stirred into the\r\nfats together with the requisite (83 lb.) caustic soda solution 72 deg. Tw.\r\n(38 deg. B.). If it is intended to use alcohol and sugar, and no glycerine,\r\nthe latter is replaced by 47 lb. of alcohol, and added after the\r\nincorporation of the caustic soda lye.\r\n\r\nThe whole being thoroughly crutched, the pan is covered and\r\nsaponification allowed to proceed for one hour or one and a half hours.\r\nShould the saponification for some reason be retarded, a little steam\r\nmay be very cautiously admitted to the jacket of the pan, the mass well\r\ncrutched until the reaction commences, and the whole allowed to rest the\r\nspecified time.\r\n\r\nWhilst saponification is proceeding, the \"sugar solution\" is prepared by\r\ndissolving 50 lb. cane sugar in 50 lb. water, at 168 deg. F. (76 deg. C.), to\r\nwhich may be added 5 lb. soda crystals, and any necessary colouring\r\nmatter. The water used for this solution should be as soft as possible,\r\nas hard water is liable to produce opaque streaks of lime soap.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary before proceeding further to ensure that\r\nsaponification is complete. A greasy, soft feel and the presence of\r\n\"strength\" (caustic) would denote incomplete saponification--this can\r\nonly be remedied by further heating and crutching. Deficiency of caustic\r\nalkali should also be avoided, and, if more lye is required, great care\r\nmust be exercised in its addition.\r\n\r\nSaponification being completed, the sugar solution is carefully and\r\ngradually crutched into the soap; when the contents of the pan have\r\nbecome a homogeneous and syrupy mass, the crutching is discontinued, and\r\nthe pan is covered for one hour. The heat of the soap in the pan should\r\nnot exceed 170 deg. F. (77 deg. C.).\r\n\r\nHaving rested the necessary period, the soap will have a slight froth on\r\nthe surface, but will be clear underneath and appear dark. Samples may\r\nnow be withdrawn, cooled, and examined prior to framing. If the process\r\nhas been successfully performed the soap will be firm and transparent,\r\nof uniform colour, and possess only a faintly alkaline taste.\r\n\r\nIf the sample be firm but opaque, more sugar solution is required; this\r\nshould be added very carefully whilst crutching, an excess being\r\nspecially guarded against. If the sample be soft, although transparent,\r\nand the alkaline taste not too pronounced, the soap evidently contains\r\nan excess of water, which may be remedied by the addition of a small\r\nquantity of soda ash; too much soda ash (carbonates) must be avoided,\r\nlest it should produce efflorescence.\r\n\r\nHaving examined the soap and found it to be correct, or having remedied\r\nits defects, the soap in the pan is allowed to cool to 145 deg. F. (63 deg. C.)\r\nand perfume added. The soap is now quickly filled into narrow frames and\r\nallowed to cool rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe blocks of soap should not be stripped until quite cold throughout,\r\nand they should be allowed to stand open for a while before slabbing.\r\nWhen freshly cut into tablets, the soap may appear somewhat turbid, but\r\nthe brightness comes with the exposure it will receive prior to stamping\r\nand wrapping.\r\n\r\n_Saponifying Mineral Oil._--This sounds somewhat incongruous, as mineral\r\noil is entirely unsaponifiable. Most of the suggestions for this purpose\r\nconsist of the incorporation of mineral oil, or mineral oil emulsified\r\nby aid of Quillaia bark, with a cocoa-nut oil soap, and in all these\r\ninstances the hydrocarbon merely exists in suspension.\r\n\r\nG. Reale (Fr. Pat. 321,510, 1902), however, proposes to heat mineral oil\r\ntogether with spermaceti and strong alkali, and states that he\r\ntransforms the hydrocarbons into alcohols, and these, absorbing oxygen,\r\nbecome fatty acids, which are converted into soap by means of the\r\nalkali.\r\n\r\nIn this connection may be quoted the interesting work of Zelinsky\r\n(_Russ. Phys. Chem. Ges. Zeits. Angew. Chem._, 1903, 37). He obtained\r\nsubstances, by acting with carbon dioxide upon magnesia compounds of\r\nchlorinated fractions of petroleum, which when decomposed by dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, yielded various organic acids. One of these acids on\r\nheating with glycerine formed tri-octin, which had the properties of a\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nDr. Engler, in confirmation of the theory of the animal origin of some\r\npetroleums, obtained what might be described as petroleum (for it\r\ncontained almost all the hydrocarbons present in the natural mineral\r\noil) by distilling animal fats and oils under pressure.\r\n\r\n_Electrical Production of Soap._--Attempts have been made to produce\r\nsoap electrically by Messrs. Nodon, Brettonneau and Shee (Eng. Pat.\r\n22,129, 1897), and also by Messrs. Merry and Noble (Eng. Pat. 2,372,\r\n1900).\r\n\r\nIn the former patent, a mixture of soda-lye and fat is agitated by\r\nelectricity at a temperature of 194 deg.-212 deg. F. (90 deg.-100\r\ndeg. C.), while in the latter caustic alkali is electrolytically\r\nproduced from brine, and deposited on wire-netting in the presence\r\nof fat, which is thereby saponified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SETTLED SOAP.\r\n\r\n     _Cleansing--Crutching--Liquoring of\r\n     Soaps--Filling--Neutralising, Colouring and\r\n     Perfuming--Disinfectant Soaps--Framing--Slabbing--Barring--Open\r\n     and Close Piling--Drying--Stamping--Cooling._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cleansing._--After completion of saponification, and allowing the\r\ncontents of the pan to settle into the various layers, as described in\r\nthe preceding chapter, the actual soap, forming the second layer, is now\r\ntransferred to the frames, this being generally termed \"cleansing\" the\r\nsoap. The thin crust or layer at the top of the pan is gently removed,\r\nand the soap may be either ladled out and conveyed to the frames, or\r\nwithdrawn by the aid of a pump from above the nigre through a skimmer\r\n(Fig. 1), and pipe, attached by means of a swivel joint (Fig. 2) (which\r\nallows the skimmer pipe to be raised or lowered at will by means of a\r\nwinch, Fig. 3), to a pipe fitted in the side of the pan as fully shown\r\nin Fig. 4, or the removal may be performed by gravitation through some\r\nmechanical device from the side of the copper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Skimmer, with flange for attachment to\r\nskimmer-pipe.]\r\n\r\nEvery precaution is taken to avoid the presence of nigre in the soap\r\nbeing cleansed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Swivel-joint.]\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which soap may be cleansed depends on the particular\r\ngrade--soaps requiring to be liquored should not be cleansed too hot or\r\na separation will take place, 150 deg. F. (66 deg. C.) may be taken as a\r\nsuitable temperature for this class of soap; in the case of firm soaps,\r\nsuch as milling base, where cooling is liable to take place in the pan\r\n(and thus affect the yield), the temperature may be 165 deg.-170 deg. F.\r\n(74 deg.-77 deg. C.). This latter class of soap is generally run direct to the\r\nframes and crutched by hand, or, to save manual labour, it may be run\r\ninto a power-driven crutching pan (neutralising material being added if\r\nnecessary) and stirred a few times before framing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Winch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Soap-boiling pan, showing skimmer pipe, swivel\r\nand winch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Hand crutch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Mechanical crutcher.]\r\n\r\n_Crutching._--This consists of stirring the hot soap in the frames by\r\nhand crutches (Fig. 5) until the temperature is sufficiently lowered and\r\nthe soap begins to assume a \"ropiness\". Crutching may also be performed\r\nmechanically. There are various types of mechanical crutchers,\r\nstationary and travelling. They may be cylindrical pans, jacketed or\r\notherwise, in the centre of which is rotated an agitator, consisting of\r\na vertical or horizontal shaft carrying several blades (Fig. 6) or the\r\nagitator may take the form of an Archimedean screw working in a cylinder\r\n(Fig. 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Mechanical crutcher.]\r\n\r\nThe kind of soap to be crutched, whether thin or stiff, will determine\r\nthe most suitable type for the purpose. The former class includes\r\n\"washer\" soap which is generally neutralised, and coloured and perfumed,\r\nif necessary, in these crutching pans, and in that case they are merely\r\nused for mixing the liquids with the hot soap prior to its passage along\r\nwooden spouts (Fig. 8) provided with outlets over the frames, in which\r\nthe crutching is continued by hand. In the case of stiff soaps requiring\r\ncomplete incorporation of liquor, the screw type is preferable, the soap\r\nbeing forced upwards by the screw, and descending between the cylinder\r\nand the sides of the pan, while the reverse action can also be brought\r\ninto play. The completion of crutching is indicated by the smoothness\r\nand stiffness of the soap when moved with a trowel, and a portion taken\r\nout at this point and cooled should present a rounded appearance. When\r\nwell mixed the resultant product is emptied directly into wheel-frames\r\nplaced underneath the outlet of the pan. It is important that the blades\r\nor worm of the agitating gear be covered with soap to avoid the\r\nocclusion of air and to prevent the soap becoming soft and spongy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Wooden soap spout.]\r\n\r\n_Liquoring of Soaps._--This consists of the addition of various alkaline\r\nsolutions to soap to produce different qualities, and is best performed\r\nin the crutching machines, although it is in some instances carried out\r\nin the frames. In the history of soap-making a large number and variety\r\nof substances have been suggested for the purpose of accomplishing some\r\nreal or supposed desirable effect when added to soap. Many of these have\r\nhad only a very short existence, and others have gradually fallen out of\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nAmongst the more practical additions most frequently adopted may be\r\nmentioned carbonate of soda, silicate of soda, and pearl ash (impure\r\ncarbonate of potash). The carbonate of soda may be used in the form of\r\n\"soda crystals,\" which, containing 62.9 per cent. of water, dissolves in\r\nits own water of crystallisation on heating, and is in that manner added\r\nto the hot soap. In the case of weak-bodied soap, this addition gives\r\nfirmness and tends to increase the detergent qualities.\r\n\r\nThe soda carbonate may also be added to soap as a solution of soda ash\r\n(58 deg. alkali) either concentrated, 62 deg. Tw. (34 deg. B.), or of various\r\nstrengths from 25 deg. Tw. (16 deg. B.) upwards. This solution stiffens and\r\nhardens soap, and the addition, which must not be excessive, or\r\nefflorescence will occur, is generally made at a temperature of 140 deg. F.\r\n(60 deg. C.). Care should always be taken in the choice of solutions for\r\nliquoring. Strong soda ash solution with a firm soap will result in a\r\nbrittle product, whereas the texture of a weak soap would be greatly\r\nimproved by such addition.\r\n\r\nA slight addition of a weak solution of pearl ash, 4 deg.-8 deg. Tw. (2.7-5.4 deg.\r\nB.), improves the appearance of many soaps intended for household\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nFor yellow soaps, containing a low percentage of fatty acids, solutions\r\nof silicate of soda of varying strengths are generally used.\r\n\r\nIt is always advisable to have a test sample made with the soap to\r\nascertain what proportion and what strength of sodium silicate solution\r\nis best suited for the grade of soap it is desired to produce. It is\r\nimportant that the soap to be \"silicated\" should be distinctly alkaline\r\n(_i.e._, have a distinct caustic taste), or the resultant soap is liable\r\nto become like stone with age. The alkaline silicate of soda (140 deg. Tw.,\r\n59.5 deg. B.) is the quality most convenient for yellow soaps; this may be\r\ndiluted to the desired gravity by boiling with water. For a reduction of\r\n3-4 per cent. fatty acids content, a solution of 6 deg. Tw. (4 deg. B.)\r\n(boiling) is most suitable, and if the reduction desired is greater, the\r\ndensity of the silicate solution should be increased; for example, to\r\neffect a reduction of 20 per cent. fatty acids content, a solution of\r\n18 deg. Tw. (12 deg. B.) (boiling) would probably be found to answer.\r\n\r\nIn some instances 140 deg. Tw. (59.5 deg. B.) silicate may be added; experiment\r\nalone will demonstrate the amount which can be satisfactorily\r\nincorporated without the soap becoming \"open,\" but 1/10 of the quantity\r\nof soap taken is practically a limit, and it will be found that the\r\ntemperature should be low; the same quantity of silicate at different\r\ntemperatures does not produce the same result. Various other strengths\r\nof sodium silicate are employed, depending upon the composition and body\r\nof the soap base--neutral silicate 75 deg. Tw. (39.4 deg. B.) also finds favour\r\nwith some soap-makers. Mixtures of soda crystals or soda ash solution\r\nwith silicate of soda solution are used for a certain grade of soap,\r\nwhich is crutched until smooth and stiff. Glauber's salt (sodium\r\nsulphate) produces a good smooth surface when added to soap, but, owing\r\nto its tendency to effloresce more quickly than soda carbonate, it is\r\nnot so much used as formerly.\r\n\r\nCommon salt sometimes forms an ingredient in liquoring mixtures.\r\nPotassium chloride and potassium silicate find a limited use for\r\nintermixing with soft soaps.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that hard and fast rules cannot be laid\r\ndown for \"liquoring\" soap, and the correct solution to be employed can\r\nonly be ascertained by experiment and experience, but the above\r\nsuggestions will prove useful as a guide towards good results. A smooth,\r\nfirm soap of clear, bright, glossy appearance is what should be aimed\r\nat.\r\n\r\n_Filling._--Some low-grade soaps contain filling, which serves no useful\r\npurpose beyond the addition of weight. Talc is the most frequently used\r\narticle of this description. It consists of hydrated silicate of\r\nmagnesium and, when finely ground, is white and greasy to the touch. The\r\naddition of this substance to the hot soap is made by suspending it in\r\nsilicate of soda solution.\r\n\r\nWhatever filling material is used, it is important that the appearance\r\nof the soap should not be materially altered.\r\n\r\n_Neutralising, Colouring and Perfuming._--The free caustic alkali in\r\nsoap, intended for toilet or laundry purposes, is usually neutralised\r\nduring the cleansing, although some soap manufacturers prefer to\r\naccomplish this during the milling operation. Various materials have\r\nbeen recommended for the purpose, those in most general use being sodium\r\nbicarbonate, boric acid, cocoa-nut oil, stearic acid, and oleic acid.\r\n\r\nThe best method is the addition of an exact quantity of sodium\r\nbicarbonate (acid sodium carbonate), which converts the caustic alkali\r\ninto carbonate. The reaction may be expressed by the equation:--\r\n\r\n          NaOH  +      NaHCO_{3}     =   Na_{2}CO_{3}    + H_{2}O\r\n    Caustic soda  Bicarbonate of soda  Carbonate of soda    Water\r\n\r\nBoric acid in aqueous or glycerine solutions, and borax (biborate of\r\nsoda) are sometimes used, but care is necessary in employing these\r\nsubstances, as any excess is liable to decompose the soap.\r\n\r\nThe addition of cocoa-nut oil is unsatisfactory, the great objection\r\nbeing that complete saponification is difficult to ensure, and, further,\r\nthere is always the liability of rancidity developing. Stearic and oleic\r\nacids are more suitable for the purpose, but oleic acid has the\r\ndisadvantage that oleates are very liable to go rancid.\r\n\r\nA large number of other substances have been proposed, and in many\r\ninstances patented, for neutralising the free caustic alkali. Among\r\nthese may be mentioned--Alder Wright's method of using an ammoniacal\r\nsalt, the acid radicle of which neutralises the caustic alkali, ammonia\r\nbeing liberated; the use of sodium and potassium bibasic phosphate (Eng.\r\nPat. 25,357, 1899); a substance formed by treating albumen with formalin\r\n(Eng. Pat., 8,582, 1900); wheat glutenin \"albuminoses\" (albumen after\r\nacid or alkaline treatment); malt extract; and egg, milk, or vegetable\r\nalbumen.\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter used may be of either vegetable or coal-tar origin,\r\nand is dissolved in the most suitable medium (lye, water, or fat). The\r\nolder types of colouring matter--such as cadmium yellow, ochres,\r\nvermilion, umbers--have been superseded.\r\n\r\nIn the production of washer household soaps, a small quantity of perfume\r\nis sometimes added.\r\n\r\n_Disinfectant Soaps._--To the soap base, which must be strong to taste,\r\nis added from 3 to 4 per cent. of coal-tar derivatives, such as carbolic\r\nacid, cresylic acid, creosote, naphthalene, or compounds containing\r\ncarbolic acid and its homologues. The incorporation is made in the\r\ncrutching pan, and further crutching may be given by hand in the frames.\r\n\r\n_Framing._--The object of framing is to allow the soap to solidify into\r\nblocks. The frames intended for mottled soaps, which require slow\r\ncooling, are constructed of wood, often with a well in the base to allow\r\nexcess of lye to accumulate--for other soaps, iron frames are in general\r\nuse. The frame manufactured by H. D. Morgan of Liverpool is shown in\r\nFig. 9.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the frame is filled, or as soon as the crutching in the frame\r\nis finished, the soap is smoothed by means of a trowel, leaving in the\r\ncentre a heap which slopes towards the sides. Next day the top of the\r\nsoap is straightened or flattened with a wooden mallet, this treatment\r\nassisting in the consolidation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Soap frame.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Slabbing machine.]\r\n\r\nThe length of time the soap should remain in frames is dependent on the\r\nquality, quantity, and season or temperature, and varies usually from\r\nthree to seven days. When the requisite period has elapsed, the sides\r\nand ends of the frames are removed, and there remains a solid block of\r\nsoap weighing from 10 to 15 cwt. according to the size of frame used.\r\nThe blocks, after scraping and trimming, are ready for cutting into\r\nslabs.\r\n\r\n_Slabbing._--This may be done mechanically by pushing the block of soap\r\nthrough a framework containing pianoforte wires fixed at equi-distances\r\n(Fig. 10, which shows a machine designed by E. Forshaw & Son, Ltd.), or\r\nthe soap may be out by hand by pulling a looped wire through the mass\r\nhorizontally along lines previously scribed, or, for a standard sized\r\nslab, the wire may be a fixture in a box-like arrangement, which is\r\npassed along the top of the soap, and the distance of the wire from the\r\ntop of the box will be the thickness of the slab (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Banjo slabber.]\r\n\r\nAll tallow soaps should be slabbed whilst still warm, cut into bars, and\r\nopen-piled immediately; if this type of soap is cold when slabbed its\r\nappearance will be very much altered.\r\n\r\n_Barring._--The slabs are out transversely into bars by means of the\r\nlooped wire, or more usually by a machine (Fig. 12), the lower framework\r\nof which, containing wires, is drawn through the soap placed on the\r\nbase-board; the framework is raised, and the bars fall upon the shelf,\r\nready for transference into piles. It has long been the custom in\r\nEngland to cut bars of soap 15 inches long, and weighing 3 lb. each, or\r\n37-1/2 bars of soap to the cwt., but in recent years a demand has arisen\r\nfor bars of so many various weights that it must be sometimes a\r\ndifficult matter to know what sizes to stock.\r\n\r\nIn another type of barring machine, portions of the slab, previously cut\r\nto size, are pushed against a framework carrying wires, and the bars\r\nslide along a table ready for handling (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\nIn cutting machines, through which \"washer\" household soap is being\r\npassed, the bar is pushed at right angles through another frame\r\ncontaining wires, which divides it into tablets; these may be received\r\nupon racks and are ready for drying and stamping. It is needless to say\r\nthat the slabs and tablets are cut with a view to reducing the amount of\r\nwaste to the lowest possible limit. Such a machine, made by E. Forshaw &\r\nSon, Ltd., is shown in Fig. 14.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Barring machine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Bar-cutting machine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Tablet-cutting machine.]\r\n\r\n_Open- and Close-piling._--As remarked previously, tallow soaps should\r\nbe cut whilst warm, and the bars \"open-piled,\" or stacked across each\r\nother in such a way that air has free access to each bar for a day. The\r\nbar of soap will skin or case-harden, and next day may be \"close-piled,\"\r\nor placed in the storage bins, where they should remain for two or three\r\nweeks, when they will be in perfect condition for packing into boxes\r\nready for distribution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Soap stamp.]\r\n\r\n_Drying._--\"Oil soaps,\" as soaps of the washer type are termed, do not\r\nskin sufficiently by the open-piling treatment, and are generally\r\nexposed on racks to a current of hot air in a drying chamber in order to\r\nproduce the skin, which prevents evaporation of water, and allows of an\r\nimpression being given by the stamp without the soap adhering to the\r\ndies. It is of course understood that heavily liquored soaps are, as a\r\nrule, unsuitable for the drying treatment, as the bars become unshapely,\r\nand lose water rapidly.\r\n\r\n_Stamping._--Bar soaps are usually stamped by means of a hand-stamp\r\ncontaining removable or fixed brass letters (Fig. 15), with a certain\r\nbrand or designation of quality and the name of the manufacturer or\r\nvendor, and are now ready for packing into boxes.\r\n\r\nA very large bulk of the soap trade consists of the household quality in\r\ntablet form, readily divided into two cakes. These are stamped in the\r\nordinary box moulds with two dies--top and bottom impressions--the\r\ndie-plates, being removable, allow the impressions to be changed. This\r\ntype of mould (Fig. 16) can be adjusted for the compression of tablets\r\nof varying thickness, the box preventing the escape of soap. We are\r\nindebted to E. Forshaw & Son, Ltd., for this illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Box mould.]\r\n\r\nThe stamping machine may be worked by hand (Fig. 17) or power driven.\r\nWhere large quantities of a particular tablet have to be stamped, one of\r\nthe many automatic mechanical stampers in existence may be employed, the\r\ntablets being conveyed to and from the dies by means of endless belts.\r\nSuch a machine is shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\nIf necessary, the soap is transferred to racks and exposed to the air,\r\nafter which it is ready for wrapping, which is generally performed by\r\nmanual labour, although in some instances automatic wrapping machines\r\nare in use.\r\n\r\nCardboard cartons are also used for encasing the wrapped tablets, the\r\nobject being that these are more conveniently handled by tradesmen and\r\nmay be advantageously used to form an attractive window display.\r\n\r\n_Cooling._--Many attempts have been made to shorten the time required\r\nfor the framing and finishing of soap, by cooling the liquid soap as it\r\nleaves the pan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Soap-stamping machine, showing box mould.]\r\n\r\nWith milling base, this is successfully accomplished in the\r\nCressonnieres' plant, by allowing the hot soap to fall upon the\r\nperiphery of a revolving drum which can be cooled internally by means of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Automatic stamper.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of household soaps, where the resultant product must be of\r\ngood appearance and have a firm texture, the difficulty is to produce a\r\nbar fit for sale after the cooling has been performed, as soap which has\r\nbeen suddenly chilled lacks the appearance of that treated in the\r\nordinary way. Several patents have been granted for various methods of\r\nmoulding into bars in tubes, where the hot soap is cooled by being\r\neither surrounded by running water in a machine of similar construction\r\nto a candle machine, or rotated through a cooling medium; and numerous\r\nclaims have been made both for mechanical appliances and for methods of\r\nremoving or discharging the bars after cooling. In many instances these\r\nhave proved unsatisfactory, owing to fracture of the crystalline\r\nstructure. Moreover, in passing through some of the devices for\r\nsolidification after chilling, the soap is churned by means of a worm or\r\nscrew, and this interferes with the firmness of the finished bar, for,\r\nas is well known, soap which has been handled too much, does not regain\r\nits former firmness, and its appearance is rendered unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nA form of apparatus which is now giving satisfactory results is the\r\nLeimdoerfer continuous cooler (Fig. 19). This consists of a fixed\r\ncharging hopper, A, a portable tank, B, containing tubes, and a\r\ndetachable box, C, which can be raised or lowered by means of a screw,\r\nD. The bottom of the hopper is fitted with holes corresponding with the\r\ncooling tubes, _e_, and closed by plugs _c_, attached to a frame _b_,\r\nwhich terminates above in a screw spindle _a_, by means of which the\r\nframe and plugs can be raised and lowered so as to permit or stop the\r\noutflow of soap into the cooling tubes. The tubes are closed at the\r\nbottom by slides _d_, and the box B, in which they are mounted, is\r\ncarried on a truck running on rails. The charging hopper can be\r\nconnected with the soap-pan by a pipe, and when the hopper is filled\r\nwith liquid soap the plugs _c_ are raised and the air in the box C\r\nexhausted, thus causing the soap to descend into the cooling tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Leimdoerfer cooler.]\r\n\r\nThe slides _d_ are closed, the screw D released, and the box B moved\r\naway to make room for another. At the end of the rail track is an\r\nejecting device which pushes the cooled soap out of the tubes, and the\r\ntruck is run back on a side track to the machine for use over again. In\r\nthis way the apparatus can be worked continuously, the soap being\r\nreceived from the cooling pipes on a suitable arrangement for transport\r\nto the press or store room.\r\n\r\nA similar idea has been made the subject of a patent by Holoubek (Eng.\r\nPat. 24,440, 1904, Fig. 20). The soap is run into frames or moulds\r\nhaving open sides, which are closed by being clamped with screws and\r\npressure plates between cooling tubes through which water circulates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Holoubek's cooler.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTOILET, TEXTILE AND MISCELLANEOUS SOAPS.\r\n\r\n     _Toilet Soaps--Cold Process Soaps--Settled Boiled\r\n     Soaps--Remelted Soaps--Milled Soaps--Drying--Milling and\r\n     Incorporating Colour, Perfume, or\r\n     Medicament--Perfume--Colouring Matter--Neutralising and\r\n     Superfatting\r\n     Material--Compressing--Cutting--Stamping--Medicated\r\n     Soaps--Ether Soap--Floating Soaps--Shaving Soaps--Textile\r\n     Soaps--Soaps for Woollen, Cotton and Silk Industries--Patent\r\n     Textile Soaps--Miscellaneous Soaps._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Toilet Soaps._--By the term \"toilet soap\" is inferred a soap specially\r\nadapted for toilet use by reason not only of its good detergent and\r\nlathering qualities, but also on account of its freedom from caustic\r\nalkali and any other ingredient likely to cause irritation or injury to\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\nToilet soaps may be simply classified according to their method of\r\npreparation into the following four classes:--\r\n\r\n          (1) Cold process soaps.\r\n          (2) Settled boiled soaps.\r\n          (3) Remelted soaps.\r\n          (4) Milled soaps.\r\n\r\nSoaps of the first class are of comparatively trifling importance,\r\nhaving been superseded by the other qualities. Details of the \"cold\r\nprocess\" have already been given on page 46; it is only necessary to add\r\nthe desired perfume and colouring matter to the soap.\r\n\r\nThe second class consists of good quality settled soaps, direct from the\r\ncopper, to which have been added, prior to framing, suitable perfume and\r\ncolouring matter, also, if necessary, dealkalising materials.\r\n\r\nThe third class is represented by soaps made by the old English method\r\nof remelting, which are often termed \"perfumers',\" or \"little pan\"\r\nsoaps. The soap-base or mixture of various kinds of soap is remelted in\r\na steam-jacketed pan, or pan provided with steam coils, and agitated.\r\nThe agitation must not be too vigorous or lengthy, or the soap will\r\nbecome aerated. When all the soap is molten, additions of pearl ash\r\nsolution are made to give it a finer and smoother texture, render it\r\nmore transparent, and increase its lathering properties. The necessary\r\ncolour, in a soluble form, is well incorporated, and lastly the perfume.\r\nOwing to volatilisation, much of the perfume is lost when added to hot\r\nsoap, and it is necessary to add a large quantity to get the desired\r\nodour; hence the cheaper essential oils have to be used, so that the\r\nperfume of this class of soap is not so delicate as that of milled\r\nsoaps, although it is quite possible to produce remelted soaps as free\r\nfrom uncombined alkali as a milled toilet soap.\r\n\r\nPalm-oil soap often forms the basis for yellow and brown toilet soaps of\r\nthis class. The old-fashioned Brown Windsor soap was originally a curd\r\nsoap that with age and frequent remelting had acquired a brown tint by\r\noxidation of the fatty acids--the oftener remelted the better the\r\nresultant soap.\r\n\r\nMedicaments are sometimes added to these soaps, _e.g._, camphor, borax,\r\ncoal-tar, or carbolic. Oatmeal and bran have been recommended in\r\ncombination with soap for toilet purposes, and a patent (Eng. Pat.\r\n26,396, 1896) has been granted for the use of these substances together\r\nwith wood-fibre impregnated with boric acid.\r\n\r\nAfter cooling in small frames, the soap is slabbed, and cut into blocks,\r\nand finally into portions suitable for stamping in a press (hand or\r\nsteam driven) with a design or lettering on each side.\r\n\r\n_Milled Toilet Soaps._--Practically all high-class soaps now on the\r\nmarket pass through the French or milling process. This treatment, as\r\nits name implies, was first practised by the French who introduced it to\r\nthis country, and consists briefly of (i.) drying, (ii.) milling and\r\nincorporating colour, perfume or medicament, (iii.) compressing, and\r\n(iv.) cutting and stamping.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of milled soap over toilet soap produced by other methods\r\nare that the former, containing less water and more actual soap, is more\r\neconomical in use, possesses a better appearance, and more elegant\r\nfinish, does not shrink or lose its shape, is more uniform in\r\ncomposition, and essential oils and delicate perfumes may be\r\nincorporated without fear of loss or deterioration.\r\n\r\nOnly soap made from best quality fats is usually milled, a suitable base\r\nbeing that obtained by saponifying a blend of the finest white tallow\r\nwith a proportion, not exceeding 25 per cent., of cocoa-nut oil, and\r\nprepared as described in Chapter V.\r\n\r\nThe first essential of a milling base is that the saponification should\r\nbe thorough and complete; if this is not ensured, rancidity is liable to\r\noccur and a satisfactory toilet soap cannot be produced. The soap must\r\nnot be short in texture or brittle and liable to split, but of a firm\r\nand somewhat plastic consistency.\r\n\r\n(i.) _Drying._--The milling-base, after solidification in the frames,\r\ncontains almost invariably from 28 to 30 per cent. of water, and this\r\nquantity must be reduced to rather less than half before the soap can be\r\nsatisfactorily milled. Cutting the soap into bars or strips and open\r\npiling greatly facilitates the drying, which is usually effected by\r\nchipping the soap and exposing it on trays to a current of hot air at\r\n95-105 deg. F. (35-40 deg. C.).\r\n\r\nThere are several forms of drying chambers in which the trays of chips\r\nare placed upon a series of racks one above another, and warm air\r\ncirculated through, and Fig. 21 shows a soap drying apparatus with fan\r\nmade by W. J. Fraser & Co., Ltd., London.\r\n\r\nThe older method of heating the air by allowing it to pass over a pipe\r\nor flue through which the products of combustion from a coke or coal\r\nfire are proceeding under the floor of the drying chamber to a small\r\nshaft, has been superseded by steam heat. The air is either drawn or\r\nforced by means of quickly revolving fans through a cylinder placed in a\r\nhorizontal position and containing steam coils, or passed over\r\nsteam-pipes laid under the iron grating forming the floor of the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Soap-drying apparatus.]\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that in the case of a bad conductor of\r\nheat, like soap-chippings, it is difficult to evaporate moisture\r\nwithout constantly moving them and exposing fresh surfaces to the\r\naction of heat.\r\n\r\nIn the Cressonnieres' system, where the shavings of chilled soap are\r\ndried by being carried through a heated chamber upon a series of endless\r\nbands (the first discharging the contents on to a lower belt which\r\nprojects at the end, and is moving in the opposite direction, and so\r\non), this is performed by intercepting milling rollers in the system of\r\nbelts (Eng. Pat. 4,916, 1898) whereby the surfaces exposed to the drying\r\nare altered, and it is claimed that the formation of hardened crust is\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary methods of drying, the chips are frequently moved by\r\nhand to assist uniform evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe degree of saturation of the air with moisture must be taken into\r\nconsideration in regulating the temperature and flow of air through the\r\ndrying chamber, and for this purpose the use of a hygrometer is\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the correct amount of moisture should be left\r\nin the soap, not too much, nor too little; the exact point can only be\r\ndetermined by judgment and experience, and depends to a considerable\r\nextent upon the nature of the soap, and also on the amount of perfume or\r\nmedicament to be added, but speaking generally, a range of 11 to 14 per\r\ncent. gives good results. If the soap contains less than this amount it\r\nis liable to crumble during the milling, will not compress\r\nsatisfactorily, and the finished tablet may have a tendency to crack and\r\ncontain gritty particles so objectionable in use. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe soap is left too moist, it is apt to stick to the rollers and mill\r\nwith difficulty, and during compression the surface assumes a blistered\r\nand sticky appearance.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Milling and Incorporation of Colour, Perfume or Medicament._--The\r\nobject of milling is to render the soap perfectly homogeneous, and to\r\nreduce it to a state in which colour, perfume, or any necessary\r\nneutralising material or other substance may be thoroughly incorporated.\r\nThe milling machine consists of smooth granite rollers, fitted with\r\nsuitable gearing and working in an iron framework (Fig. 22). The rollers\r\nare connected in such a manner that they rotate at different speeds, and\r\nthis increases the efficiency of the milling, and ensures that the\r\naction of the rollers is one of rubbing rather than crushing.\r\n\r\nBy means of suitably arranged screws the pressure of the rollers on one\r\nanother can be adjusted to give the issuing soap any desired thickness;\r\ncare should be taken that the sheets of soap are not unnecessarily thick\r\nor the colour and odour will not be uniform.\r\n\r\nThe soap, in the form of chips, is introduced on to the rollers through\r\na hopper, and after one passage through the mill, from bottom to top,\r\none of the serrated knife edges is applied and the ribbons of the soap\r\nare delivered into the top of the hopper where the colour, perfume, and\r\nany other desired admixture is added, and the milling operation repeated\r\nthree or four times. When the incorporation is complete the other\r\nscraper is fixed against the top roller and the soap ribbon passed into\r\nthe receptacle from which it is conveyed to the compressor. A better\r\nplan, however, especially in the case of the best grade soaps, where the\r\nperfumes added are necessarily more delicate and costly, is to make the\r\naddition of the perfume when the colour has been thoroughly mixed\r\nthroughout the mass. Another method is to mill once and transfer the\r\nmass to a rotary mixing machine, fitted with internal blades, of a\r\npeculiar form, which revolve in opposite directions one within the other\r\nas the mixer is rotated. The perfume, colouring matter, etc., are added\r\nand the mixer closed and set in motion, when, after a short time, the\r\nsoap is reduced to a fine granular condition, with the colour and\r\nperfume evenly distributed throughout the whole. By the use of such\r\nmachines, the loss of perfume by evaporation, which during milling is\r\nquite appreciable, is reduced to a minimum, and the delicacy of the\r\naroma is preserved unimpaired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Milling machine.]\r\n\r\nProlonged milling, especially with a suitable soap base, tends to\r\nproduce a semi-transparent appearance, which is admired by some, but the\r\nincreased cost of production by the repeated milling is not accompanied\r\nby any real improvement in the soap.\r\n\r\n_Perfume._--The materials used in perfuming soap will be dealt with\r\nfully in the next chapter. The quantity necessary to be added varies\r\nconsiderably with the nature of the essential oils, and also the price\r\nat which the soap is intended to be sold. In the cheaper grades of\r\nmilled soaps the quantity will range from 10-30 fluid ozs. per cwt., and\r\nbut rarely exceeds 18-20 ozs., whereas in more costly soaps as much as\r\n40-50 fluid ozs. are sometimes added to the cwt.\r\n\r\n_Colouring Matter._--During recent years an outcry has been made against\r\nhighly coloured soaps, and the highest class soaps have been\r\nmanufactured either colourless or at the most with only a very delicate\r\ntint. It is obvious that a white soap guarantees the use of only the\r\nhighest grade oils and fats, and excludes the introduction of any rosin,\r\nand, so far, the desire for a white soap is doubtless justified. Many\r\nperfumes, however, tend to quickly discolour a soap, hence the advantage\r\nof giving it a slight tint. For this purpose a vegetable colouring\r\nmatter is preferable, and chlorophyll is very suitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Compressor.]\r\n\r\nA demand still exists for brightly coloured soaps, and this is usually\r\nmet by the use of coal-tar dyes. The quantity required is of course\r\nextremely small, so that no harm or disagreeable result could possibly\r\narise from their use.\r\n\r\n_Neutralising and Superfatting Material._--If desired, the final\r\nneutralisation of free alkali can be carried out during the milling\r\nprocess, any superfatting material being added at the same time. The\r\nchief neutralising reagents have already been mentioned in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nWith regard to superfatting material, the quantity of this should be\r\nvery small, not exceeding 6-8 ozs. per cwt: The most suitable materials\r\nare vaseline, lanoline, or spermaceti.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24--Hand soap-stamping press.]\r\n\r\n(iii.) _Compressing._--The next stage is the compression and binding of\r\nthe soap ribbons into a solid bar suitable for stamping, and the plant\r\nused (Fig. 23) for this purpose is substantially the same in all\r\nfactories. The soap is fed through a hopper into a strong metal\r\nconical-shaped tube like a cannon, which tapers towards the nozzle, and\r\nin which a single or twin screw is moving, and the soap is thereby\r\nforced through a perforated metallic disc, subjected to great pressure,\r\nand compressed. The screws must be kept uniformly covered with shavings\r\nduring compression to obviate air bubbles in the soap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Screw press.]\r\n\r\nThe soap finally emerges through the nozzle (to which is attached a\r\ncutter of suitable shape and size according to the form it is intended\r\nthe final tablet to take) as a long, polished, solid bar, which is cut\r\nwith a knife or wire into lengths of 2 or 3 feet, and if of satisfactory\r\nappearance, is ready for cutting and stamping. The nozzle of the plodder\r\nis heated by means of a Bunsen burner to about 120 deg. or 130 deg. F.\r\n(49 deg.-55 deg. C.) to allow the soap to be easily forced out, and this\r\nalso imparts a good gloss and finish to the ejected bar--if the nozzle\r\nis too hot, however, the soap will be blistered, whereas insufficient\r\nheat will result in streaky soap of a poor and dull appearance.\r\n\r\n(iv.) _Cutting and Stamping._--In cutting the soap into sections for\r\nstamping, the cutter should shape it somewhat similar to the required\r\nfinished tablet.\r\n\r\nMany manufacturers cut the soap into sections having concave ends, and\r\nin stamping, the corners are forced into the concavity, with the result\r\nthat unsightly markings are produced at each end of the tablet. It is\r\npreferable to have a cutter with convex ends, and if the stamping is to\r\nbe done in a pin mould the shape should be a trifle larger than the\r\nexact size of the desired tablet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26--Pin mould.]\r\n\r\nThe stamping may be performed by a hand stamper (Fig. 24), a screw press\r\n(Fig. 25), or by a steam stamper. The screw press works very\r\nsatisfactorily for toilet soaps.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of moulds in use for milled soaps:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Pin Moulds_ in which tablets of one size and shape only can be\r\nproduced (Fig. 25). The edges of the mould meet very exactly, the upper\r\npart of the die carries two pins attached to the shoulder, and these are\r\nreceived into two holes in the shoulder of the bottom plate. The\r\nsuperfluous soap is forced out as the dies meet.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Band or Collar Moulds._--In this form (Fig, 27) the mould may be\r\nadjusted to stamp various sized tablets, say from 2 ozs. to 5-1/3 ozs.\r\nand different impressions given by means of removable die plates. The\r\nband or collar prevents the soap squeezing out sideways. We are indebted\r\nto R. Forehaw & Son, Ltd., for the loan of this illustration.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to moisten the soap or mould with a dilute solution of\r\nglycerine if it should have a tendency to stick to the die plates.\r\n\r\nThe soap is then ready for final trimming, wrapping, and boxing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27--Band Mould.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICATED SOAPS.\r\n\r\nThe inherent cleansing power of soap renders it invaluable in combating\r\ndisease, while it also has distinct germicidal properties, a 2 per cent.\r\nsolution proving fatal to B. coli communis in less than six hours, and\r\neven a 1 per cent. solution having a marked action on germs in fifteen\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nMany makers, however, seek more or less successfully to still further\r\nincrease the value of soap in this direction by the incorporation of\r\nvarious drugs and chemicals; and the number of medicated soaps on the\r\nmarket is now very large. Such soaps may consist of either hard or soft\r\nsoaps to which certain medicaments have been added, and can be roughly\r\ndivided into two classes, (_a_) those which contain a specific for\r\nvarious definite diseases, the intention being that the remedy should be\r\nabsorbed by the pores of the skin and thus penetrate the system, and\r\n(_b_) those impregnated with chemicals intended to act as antiseptics or\r\ngermicides, or, generally, as disinfectants.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of medicinal soaps appears to have been first taken up\r\nin a scientific manner by Unna of Hamburg in 1886, who advocated the use\r\nof soap in preference to plasters as a vehicle for the application of\r\ncertain remedies.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, he considered a soap-stock made entirely from beef tallow\r\nthe most suitable for the purpose, but in practice found that the best\r\nresults were obtained by using a superfatted soap made from a blend of\r\none part of olive oil with eight parts of beef tallow, saponified with a\r\nmixture of two parts of soda to one part of potash, sufficient fat being\r\nemployed to leave an excess of 3 or 4 per cent. unsaponified. Recent\r\nresearches have shown, however, that even if a superfatted soap-base is\r\nbeneficial for the preparation of toilet soaps (a point which is open to\r\ndoubt), it is quite inadmissible for the manufacture of germicidal and\r\ndisinfectant soaps, the bactericidal efficiency of which is much\r\nrestricted by the presence of free fat.\r\n\r\nMany of the medicaments added to soaps require special methods of\r\nincorporation therein, as they otherwise react with the soap and\r\ndecompose it, forming comparatively inert compounds. This applies\r\nparticularly to salts of mercury, such as _corrosive sublimate_ or\r\nmercuric chloride, and _biniodide of mercury_, both of which have very\r\nconsiderable germicidal power, and are consequently frequently added to\r\nsoaps. If simply mixed with the soap in the mill, reaction very quickly\r\ntakes place between the mercury salt and the soap, with formation of the\r\ninsoluble mercury compounds of the fatty acids, a change which can be\r\nreadily seen to occur in such a soap by the rapid development on\r\nkeeping, of a dull slaty-green appearance. Numerous processes have been\r\nsuggested, and in some cases patented, to overcome this difficulty. In\r\nthe case of corrosive sublimate, Geissler suggested that the soap to\r\nwhich this reagent is to be added should contain an excess of fatty\r\nacids, and would thereby be rendered stable. This salt has also been\r\nincorporated with milled soap in a dry state in conjunction with\r\nammonio-mercuric chloride, [beta]-naphthol, methyl salicylate, and\r\neucalyptol. It is claimed that these bodies are present in an unchanged\r\ncondition, and become active when the soap is added to water as in\r\nwashing. Ehrhardt (Eng. Pat. 2,407, 1898) patented a method of making\r\nantiseptic mercury soap by using mercury albuminate--a combination of\r\nmercuric chloride and casein, which is soluble in alkali, and added to\r\nthe soap in an alkaline solution.\r\n\r\nWith biniodide of mercury the interaction can be readily obviated by\r\nadding to the biniodide of mercury an equal weight of potassium iodide.\r\nThis process, devised and patented by J. Thomson in 1886, has been\r\nworked since that time with extremely satisfactory results. Strengths of\r\n1/2, 1, and 3 per cent. biniodide are sold, but owing to the readiness\r\nwith which it is absorbed by the skin a soap containing more than 1/2\r\nper cent. should only be used under medical advice.\r\n\r\nA similar combination of _bromide of mercury_ with potassium, sodium, or\r\nammonium bromide has recently been patented by Cooke for admixture with\r\nliquid, hard, or soft soaps.\r\n\r\n_Zinc and other Metallic Salts._--At various times salts of metals other\r\nthan mercury have been added to soap, but, owing to their insolubility\r\nin water, their efficiency as medicaments is very trifling or nil.\r\nCompounds have been formed of metallic oxides and other salts with oleic\r\nsaid, and mixtures made with vaseline and lanoline, and incorporated\r\nwith soap, but they have not met with much success.\r\n\r\nAnother chemical commonly added to soap is _Borax_. In view of its\r\nalkaline reaction to litmus, turning red litmus blue, this salt is no\r\ndoubt generally regarded as alkaline, and, as such, without action on\r\nsoap. On the contrary, however, it is an acid salt containing an excess\r\nof boric acid over the soda present, hence when it is added to soap,\r\nfatty acids are necessarily liberated, causing the soap to quickly\r\nbecome rancid. As a remedy for this it has been proposed to add\r\nsufficient alkali to convert the borax into neutral mono-borate of soda\r\nwhich is then added to the soap. This process is patented and the name\r\n\"Kastilis\" has been given to the neutral salt. The incorporation of\r\nborax with the addition of gum tragasol forms the subject of two patents\r\n(Eng. Pats. 4,415, 1904; and 25,425, 1905); increased detergent and\r\nlasting properties are claimed for the soap. Another patented process\r\n(Eng. Pat. 17,218, 1904) consists of coating the borax with a protective\r\nlayer of fat or wax before adding to the soap with the idea that\r\nreaction will not take place until required. _Boric acid_ possesses the\r\ndefects of borax in a greater degree, and would, of course, simply form\r\nsodium borate with liberation of fatty acids, so should never be added\r\nto a neutral soap.\r\n\r\n_Salicylic Acid_ is often recommended for certain skin diseases, and\r\nhere again the addition of the acid to soap under ordinary conditions\r\nresults in the formation of sodium salicylate and free fatty acids.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this a process has recently been patented for rubbing the\r\nacid up with vaseline before addition to soap, but the simplest way\r\nappears to be to add the soda salt of the acid to soap.\r\n\r\nAmongst the more common milled medicated toilet soaps may be mentioned,\r\nin addition to the above:--\r\n\r\n_Birch Tar Soap_, containing 5 or 10 per cent. birch tar, which has a\r\ncharacteristic pungent odour and is recommended as a remedy for eczema\r\nand psoriasis.\r\n\r\n_Carbolic Soap._--A toilet soap should not contain more than 3 per cent.\r\nof pure phenol, for with larger quantities irritation is likely to be\r\nexperienced by susceptible skins.\r\n\r\n_Coal Tar._--These soaps contain, in addition to carbolic acid and its\r\nhomologues, naphthalene and other hydrocarbons derived from coal,\r\nnaphthol, bases, etc. Various blends of different fractions of coal tar\r\nare used, but the most valuable constituents from a disinfectant point\r\nof view are undoubtedly the phenols, or tar acids, though in this case\r\nas with carbolic and cresylic soaps, the amount of phenols should not\r\nexceed 3 per cent. in a toilet soap. An excess of naphthalene should\r\nalso be avoided, since, on account of its strong odour, soaps containing\r\nmuch of it are unpopular. The odour of coal tar is considerably modified\r\nby and blends well with a perfume containing oils of cassia, lavender,\r\nspike, and red thyme.\r\n\r\n_Formaldehyde._--This substance is one of the most powerful\r\ndisinfectants known, and it may be readily introduced into soap without\r\nundergoing any decomposition, by milling in 2-3 per cent. of formalin, a\r\n40 per cent. aqueous solution of formaldehyde, which is a gas. White\r\nsoaps containing this chemical retain their whiteness almost\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nNew combinations of formaldehyde with other bodies are constantly being\r\nbrought forward as disinfectants. Among others the compound resulting\r\nfrom heating lanoline with formaldehyde has been patented (Eng. Pat.\r\n7,169, 1898), and is recommended as an antiseptic medicament for\r\nincorporation with soap.\r\n\r\n_Glycerine._--Nearly all soaps contain a small quantity of this body\r\nwhich is not separated in the lyes. In some cases, however, a much\r\nlarger quantity is desired, up to some 6 or 8 per cent. To mill this in\r\nrequires great care, otherwise the soap tends to blister during\r\ncompression. The best way is to dry the soap somewhat further than\r\nusual, till it contains say only 9 or 10 per cent. moisture and then\r\nmill in the glycerine.\r\n\r\n_Ichthyol_ or _Ammonium-Ichthyol-Sulphonate_ is prepared by treating\r\nwith sulphuric acid, and afterwards with ammonia, the hydrocarbon oil\r\ncontaining sulphur obtained by the dry distillation of the fossil\r\nremains of fish and sea-animals, which form a bituminous mineral deposit\r\nin Germany. This product has been admixed with soap for many years, the\r\nquantity generally used being about 5 per cent.; the resultant soap is\r\npossessed of a characteristic empyreumatic smell, very dark colour, and\r\nis recommended for rosacea and various skin diseases, and also as an\r\nanti-rheumatic. Ichthyol has somewhat changed its character during\r\nrecent years, being now almost completely soluble in water, and stronger\r\nin odour than formerly.\r\n\r\n_Iodine._--A soap containing iodine is sometimes used in scrofulous skin\r\ndiseases. It should contain some 3 per cent. iodine, while potassium\r\niodide should also be added to render the iodine soluble.\r\n\r\n_Lysol._--This name is applied to a soap solution of cresol, \"Lysol\r\nSoap\" being simply another form of coal-tar soap. The usual strength is\r\n10 per cent. lysol, and constitutes a patented article (Fr. Pat.\r\n359,061, 1905).\r\n\r\n_Naphthol._--[beta]-Naphthol, also a coal-tar derivative, is a good\r\ngermicide, and, incorporated in soap to the extent of 3 per cent.\r\ntogether with sulphur, is recommended for scabies, eczema and many other\r\ncutaneous affections.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur._--Since sulphur is insoluble in water, its action when used in\r\nconjunction with soap can be but very slow and slight. Sulphur soaps\r\nare, however, very commonly sold, and 10 per cent. is the strength\r\nusually advocated, though many so-called sulphur soaps actually contain\r\nvery little sulphur. They are said to be efficacious for acne and\r\nrosacea.\r\n\r\nSulphur soaps, when dissolved in water, gradually generate sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, which, although characteristic, makes their use disagreeable\r\nand lessens their popular estimation.\r\n\r\n_Terebene._--The addition of this substance to soap, though imparting a\r\nvery refreshing and pleasant odour, does not materially increase the\r\ndisinfectant value of the soap. A suitable strength is 5 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Thymol._--This furnishes a not unpleasant, and very useful antiseptic\r\nsoap, recommended especially for the cleansing of ulcerated wounds and\r\nrestoring the skin to a healthy state. The normal strength is 3 per\r\ncent. It is preferable to replace part of the thymol with red thyme oil,\r\nthe thymene of which imparts a sweeter odour to the soap than if\r\nproduced with thymol alone. A suitable blend is 2-1/2 per cent. of\r\nthymol crystals and 1-1/2 per cent. of a good red thyme oil.\r\n\r\nOf the vast number of less known proposed additions to toilet soaps,\r\nmention may be made in passing of:--\r\n\r\n_Fluorides._--These have been somewhat popular during recent years for\r\nthe disinfection of breweries, etc., and also used to some extent as\r\nfood preservatives. Of course only neutral fluorides are available for\r\nuse in soap, acid fluorides and soap being obviously incompatible. In\r\nthe authors' experience, however, sodium fluoride appears to have little\r\nvalue as a germicide when added to soap, such soaps being found to\r\nrapidly become rancid and change colour.\r\n\r\n_Albumen._--The use of albumen--egg, milk, and vegetable--in soap has\r\nbeen persistently advocated in this country during the past few years.\r\nThe claims attributed to albumen are, that it neutralises free alkali,\r\ncauses the soap to yield a more copious lather, and helps to bind it\r\nmore closely, and a further inducement held out is that it allows more\r\nwater to be left in the soap without affecting its firmness. Experiments\r\nmade by the authors did not appear to justify any enthusiasm on the\r\nsubject, and the use of albumen for soap-making in this country appears\r\nto be very slight, however popular it may be on the Continent. Numerous\r\nother substances have been proposed for addition to soaps, including\r\nyeast, tar from peat (sphagnol), Swedish wood tar, permanganate of\r\npotash, perborates and percarbonates of soda and ammonia, chlorine\r\ncompounds, but none of these has at present come much into favour, and\r\nsome had only ephemeral existence. Of the many drugs that it has been\r\nsuggested to admix in soap for use in allaying an irritable condition of\r\nthe skin, the majority are obviously better applied in the form of\r\nointments, and we need not consider them further.\r\n\r\n_Ether Soap._--Another form of medicated soap made by a few firms is a\r\nliquid ether soap containing mercuric iodide, and intended for surgeons'\r\nuse. This, as a rule, consists of a soap made from olive oil and potash,\r\ndissolved in alcohol and mixed with ether, the mercuric iodide being\r\ndissolved in a few drops of water containing an equal weight of\r\npotassium iodide, and this solution added to the alcohol-ether soap.\r\n\r\n_Floating Soaps._--Attempts have been made to produce tablets of soap\r\nthat will float upon the surface of water, by inserting cork, or floats,\r\nor a metallic plate in such a manner that there is an air space between\r\nthe metal and the soap. The more usual method is to incorporate into\r\nhot soap sufficient air, by means of a specially designed self-contained\r\njacketed crutcher, in which two shafts carrying small blades or paddles\r\nrotate in opposite directions, to reduce the density of the soap below\r\nthat of water and so enable the compressed tablet to float. The\r\ndifference in weight of a tablet of the same size before and after\r\naerating amounts to 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nOrdinary milling soap is used as a basis for this soap; the settled soap\r\ndirect from the copper at 170 deg. F. (77 deg. C.) is carefully neutralised with\r\nbicarbonate of sodium, oleic or stearic acids, or boro-glyceride,\r\nperfumed and aerated.\r\n\r\nFloating soap, which is usually white (some are of a cream tint), cannot\r\nbe recommended as economical, whilst its deficiency in lathering\r\nproperties, owing to occluded air, is a serious drawback to its\r\npopularity as a toilet detergent.\r\n\r\n_Shaving Soaps._--The first essential of a shaving soap, apart from its\r\nfreedom from caustic alkali or any substance exerting an irritating\r\neffect upon the skin, is the quick production of a profuse creamy lather\r\nwhich is lasting. Gum tragacanth is used in some cases to give lasting\r\npower or durability, but is not necessary, as this property is readily\r\nattained by the use of a suitable proportion of potash soap. The best\r\nshaving soaps are mixtures of various proportions of neutral soda and\r\npotash soaps, produced by the combination of ordinary milling base with\r\na white potash soap, either melted or milled together. Glycerine is\r\nsometimes added, and is more satisfactorily milled in.\r\n\r\nEvery precaution should be taken to ensure thorough saponification of\r\nthe soaps intended for blending in shaving soap, otherwise there will be\r\na tendency to become discoloured and develop rancidity with age. Shaving\r\nsoaps are delicately perfumed, and are placed on the market either in\r\nthe form of sticks which are cut from the bar of soap as it leaves the\r\ncompressor, or stamped in flat cakes.\r\n\r\nShaving creams and pastes are of the same nature as shaving soaps, but\r\nusually contain a larger proportion of superfatting material and\r\nconsiderably more water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXTILE SOAPS.\r\n\r\nIn the woollen, cloth, and silk textile industries, the use of soap for\r\ndetergent and emulsifying purposes is necessary in several of the\r\nprocesses, and the following is a brief description of the kinds of soap\r\nsuccessfully employed in the various stages.\r\n\r\n1. _Woollen Industry._--The scouring of wool is the most important\r\noperation--it is the first treatment raw wool is subjected to, and if it\r\nis not performed in an efficient manner, gives rise to serious\r\nsubsequent troubles to manufacturer, dyer, and finisher.\r\n\r\nThe object of scouring wool is to remove the wool-fat and wool\r\nperspiration (exuded from the skin of sheep), consisting of cholesterol\r\nand isocholesterol, and potassium salts of fatty acids, together with\r\nother salts, such as sulphates, chlorides, and phosphates. This is\r\neffected by washing in a warm dilute soap solution, containing in the\r\ncase of low quality wool, a little carbonate of soda; the fatty matter\r\nis thereby emulsified and easily removed.\r\n\r\nSoap, to be suitable for the purpose, must be free from uncombined\r\ncaustic alkali, unsaponified fat, silicates, and rosin.\r\n\r\nWool can be dissolved in a moderately dilute solution of caustic soda,\r\nand the presence of this latter in soap, even in small quantities, is\r\ntherefore liable to injure the fibres and make the resultant fabric\r\npossess a harsh \"feel,\" and be devoid of lustre.\r\n\r\nUnsaponified fat denotes badly made soap--besides reducing the\r\nemulsifying power of the liberated alkali, this fat may be absorbed by\r\nthe fibres and not only induce rancidity but also cause trouble in\r\ndyeing.\r\n\r\nSoaps containing silicates may have a deleterious action upon the\r\nfibres, causing them to become damaged and broken.\r\n\r\nBy general consent soaps containing rosin are unsuitable for use by\r\nwoollen manufacturers, as they produce sticky insoluble lime and\r\nmagnesia compounds which are deposited upon the fibres, and give rise to\r\nunevenness in the dyeing.\r\n\r\nA neutral olive-oil soft soap is undoubtedly the best for the purpose of\r\nwool scouring, as, owing to its ready solubility in water, it quickly\r\npenetrates the fibres, is easily washed out, and produces a good \"feel\"\r\nso essential in the best goods, and tends to preserve the lustre and\r\npliability of the fibre.\r\n\r\nThe high price of olive-oil soap, however, renders its use prohibitive\r\nfor lower class goods, and in such cases no better soap can be suggested\r\nthan the old-fashioned curd mottled or curd soaps (boiled very dry), as\r\nfree as possible from uncombined caustic alkali. The raw wool, after\r\nthis cleansing operation, is oiled with olive oil or oleine, prior to\r\nspinning; after spinning and weaving, the fabric, in the form of yarn or\r\ncloth, has to be scoured to free it from oil. The soap in most general\r\nuse for scouring woollen fabrics is neutral oleine-soda soap. Some\r\nmanufacturers prefer a cheap curd soap, such as is generally termed\r\n\"second curd,\" and in cases where lower grades of wools are handled, the\r\nuser is often willing to have soap containing rosin (owing to its\r\ncheapness) and considers a little alkalinity desirable to assist in\r\nremoving the oil.\r\n\r\nAnother operation in which soap is used, is that of milling or fulling,\r\nwhereby the fabric is made to shrink and thus becomes more compact and\r\ncloser in texture. The fabric is thoroughly cleansed, for which purpose\r\nthe soap should be neutral and free from rosin and silicates, otherwise\r\na harsh feeling or stickiness will be produced. Curd soaps or\r\nfinely-fitted soaps made from tallow or bleached palm oil, with or\r\nwithout the addition of cocoa-nut oil, give the best results. All traces\r\nof soap must be carefully removed if the fabric is to be dyed.\r\n\r\nThe woollen dyer uses soap on the dyed pieces to assist the milling,\r\nand finds that a good soap, made from either olive oil, bleached palm\r\noil, or tallow, is preferable, and, although it is generally specified\r\nto be free from alkali, a little alkalinity is not of consequence, for\r\nthe woollen goods are, as a rule, acid after dyeing, and this alkalinity\r\nwould be instantly neutralised.\r\n\r\n2. _Cotton Industry._--Cotton fibres are unacted upon by caustic alkali,\r\nso that the soap used in cleaning and preparing cotton goods for dyeing\r\nneed not be neutral, in fact alkalinity is a distinct advantage in order\r\nto assist the cleansing.\r\n\r\nAny curd soap made from tallow, with or without the addition of a small\r\nquantity of cocoa-nut oil, may be advantageously used for removing the\r\nnatural oil.\r\n\r\nIn cotton dyeing, additions of soap are often made to the bath, and in\r\nsuch cases the soap must be of good odour and neutral, lest the colours\r\nshould be acted upon and tints altered. Soaps made from olive oil and\r\npalm oil are recommended. The same kind of soap is sometimes used for\r\nsoaping the dyed cotton goods.\r\n\r\nThe calico-printer uses considerable quantities of soap for cleansing\r\nthe printed-cloths. The soap not only cleanses by helping to remove the\r\ngummy and starchy constituents of the adhering printing paste, but also\r\nplays an important part in fixing and brightening the colours. Soaps\r\nintended for this class of work must be quite neutral (to obviate any\r\npossible alteration in colour by the action of free alkali), free from\r\nobjectionable odour and rosin, and readily soluble in water. These\r\nqualities are possessed by olive-oil soaps, either soft or hard. A\r\nneutral olive-oil soft soap, owing to its solubility in cold water, may\r\nbe used for fibres coloured with most delicate dyes, which would be\r\nfugitive in hot soap solutions, and this soap is employed for the most\r\nexpensive work.\r\n\r\nOlive-oil curd (soda) soaps are in general use; those made from palm oil\r\nare also recommended, although they are not so soluble as the olive-oil\r\nsoaps. Tallow curd soaps are sometimes used, but the difficulty with\r\nwhich they dissolve is a drawback, and renders them somewhat unsuitable.\r\n\r\n3. _Silk Industry._--Silk is secured to remove the sericin or silk-glue\r\nand adhering matter from the raw silk, producing thereby lustre on the\r\nsoftened fibre and thus preparing it for the dyer.\r\n\r\nThe very best soap for the purpose is an olive-oil soft soap; olive-oil\r\nand oleine hard soaps may also be used. The soap is often used in\r\nconjunction with carbonate of soda to assist the removal of the sericin,\r\nbut, whilst carbonates are permissible, it is necessary to avoid an\r\nexcess of caustic soda.\r\n\r\nTallow soaps are so slowly soluble that they are not applicable to the\r\nscouring of silk.\r\n\r\nThe dyer of silk requires soap, which is neutral and of a pleasant\r\nodour. The preference is given to neutral olive-oil soft soap, but hard\r\nsoaps (made from olive oil, oleine, or palm oil) are used chiefly on\r\naccount of cheapness. It is essential, however, that the soap should be\r\nfree from rosin on account of its frequent use and consequent\r\ndecomposition in the acid dye bath, when any liberated rosin acids would\r\ncling to the silk fibres and produce disagreeable results.\r\n\r\n_Patent Textile Soaps._--Stockhausen (Eng. Pat. 24,868, 1897) makes\r\nspecial claim for a soap, termed Monopole Soap, to be used in place of\r\nTurkey-red oils in the dyeing and printing of cotton goods and finishing\r\nof textile fabrics. The soap is prepared by heating the sulphonated oil\r\n(obtained on treatment of castor oil with sulphuric acid) with alkali,\r\nand it is stated that the product is not precipitated when used in the\r\ndye-bath as is ordinary soap, nor is it deposited upon the fibres.\r\n\r\nAnother patent (Eng. Pat. 16,382, 1897), has for its object the\r\nobviating of the injurious effects upon wool, of alkali liberated from a\r\nsolution of soap. It is proposed to accomplish this by sulphonating part\r\nof the fat used in making the soap.\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous Soaps._--Under this heading may be classed soaps intended\r\nfor special purposes and consisting essentially of ordinary boiled soap\r\nto which additions of various substances have been made.\r\n\r\nWith additions of naphtha, fractions of petroleum, and turpentine, the\r\ndetergent power of the soap is increased by the action of these\r\nsubstances in removing grease.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many other additions may be mentioned: ox-gall or\r\nderivatives therefrom (for carpet-cleaning soap), alkali sulphides (for\r\nuse of lead-workers), aniline colours (for home-dyeing soaps), pumice\r\nand tripoli (motorists' soaps), pine-needle oil, in some instances\r\ntogether with lanoline (for massage soaps), pearl-ash (for soap intended\r\nto remove oil and tar stains), magnesia, rouge, ammonium carbonate,\r\nchalk (silversmiths' soap), powdered orris, precipitated chalk,\r\nmagnesium carbonate (tooth soaps).\r\n\r\nSoap powders or dry soaps are powdered mixtures of soap, soda ash, or\r\nsoda crystals, and other chemicals, whilst polishing soaps often contain\r\nfrom 85 to 90 per cent. siliceous matter, and can scarcely be termed\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSOAP PERFUMES.\r\n\r\n     _Essential Oils--Source and Preparation--Properties--Artificial\r\n     and Synthetic Perfumes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of raw materials, both natural and artificial, at the\r\ndisposal of the perfumer, has increased so enormously during recent\r\nyears that the scenting of soaps has now become an art requiring very\r\nconsiderable skill, and a thorough knowledge of the products to be\r\nhandled. Not only does the all-important question of odour come into\r\nconsideration, but the action of the perfumes on the soap, and on each\r\nother, has also to be taken into account. Thus, many essential oils and\r\nsynthetic perfumes cause the soap to darken rapidly on keeping, _e.g._,\r\nclove oil, cassia oil, heliotropin, vanillin. Further, some odoriferous\r\nsubstances, from their chemical nature, are incompatible with soap, and\r\nsoon decompose any soap to which they are added, while in a few cases,\r\nthe blending of two unsuitable perfumes results, by mutual reaction, in\r\nthe effect of each being lost. In the case of oils like bergamot oil,\r\nthe odour value of which depends chiefly on their ester content, it is\r\nvery important that these should not be added to soaps containing much\r\nfree alkali, as these esters are readily decomposed thereby. Some\r\nperfumes possess the property of helping the soap to retain other and\r\nmore delicate odours considerably longer than would otherwise be\r\npossible. Such perfumes are known as \"fixing agents\" or \"fixateurs,\" and\r\namong the most important of these may be mentioned musk, both natural\r\nand artificial, civet, the oils of Peru balsam, sandalwood, and\r\npatchouli, and benzyl benzoate.\r\n\r\nThe natural perfumes employed for addition to soaps are almost entirely\r\nof vegetable origin, and consist of essential oils, balsams, and resins,\r\nanimal perfumes such as musk, civet, and ambergris being reserved\r\nprincipally for the preparation of \"extraits\".\r\n\r\nAs would be expected with products of such diverse character, the\r\nmethods employed for the preparation of essential oils vary\r\nconsiderably. Broadly speaking, however, the processes may be divided\r\ninto three classes--(1) _expression_, used for orange, lemon, and lime\r\noils; (2) _distillation_, employed for otto of rose, geranium,\r\nsandalwood, and many other oils; and (3) _extraction_, including\r\n_enfleurage_, by which the volatile oil from the flowers is either first\r\nabsorbed by a neutral fat such as lard, and then extracted therefrom by\r\nmaceration in alcohol, or directly extracted from the flowers by means\r\nof a volatile solvent such as benzene, petroleum ether, or chloroform.\r\nThe last process undoubtedly furnishes products most nearly resembling\r\nthe natural floral odours, and is the only one which does not destroy\r\nthe delicate fragrance of the violet and jasmine. The yield, however, is\r\nextremely small, and concrete perfumes prepared in this way are\r\ntherefore somewhat costly.\r\n\r\nThe essential oils used are derived from upwards of twenty different\r\nbotanical families, and are obtained from all parts of the world. Thus,\r\nfrom Africa we have geranium and clove oils; from America, bay, bois de\r\nrose, Canadian snake root, cedarwood, linaloe, peppermint, petitgrain,\r\nand sassafras; from Asia, camphor, cassia, cinnamon, patchouli,\r\nsandalwood, star anise, ylang-ylang, and the grass oils, _viz._,\r\ncitronella, lemongrass, palmarosa, and vetivert; from Australia,\r\neucalyptus; while in Europe there are the citrus oils, bergamot, lemon,\r\nand orange, produced by Sicily, aspic, lavender, neroli, petitgrain, and\r\nrosemary by France, caraway and clove by Holland, anise by Russia, and\r\notto of rose by Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to classify essential oils either on a botanical\r\nbasis or according to their chemical composition, but neither method is\r\nvery satisfactory, and, in describing the chief constituents and\r\nproperties of the more important oils, we have preferred therefore to\r\narrange them alphabetically, as being simpler for reference.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of some difficulty to judge the purity of essential oils,\r\nnot only because of their complex nature, but owing to the very great\r\neffect upon their properties produced by growing the plants in different\r\nsoils and under varying climatic conditions, and still more to the\r\nhighly scientific methods of adulteration adopted by unscrupulous\r\nvendors. The following figures will be found, however, to include all\r\nnormal oils.\r\n\r\n_Anise Stell_, or _Star Anise_, from the fruit of Illicium verum,\r\nobtained from China. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.980-0.990; optical\r\nrotation, faintly dextro- or laevo-rotatory, +0 deg. 30' to -2 deg.; refractive\r\nindex at 20 deg. C., 1.553-1.555; solidifying point, 14 deg.-17 deg. C.; solubility\r\nin 90 per cent. alcohol, 1 in 3 or 4.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of the oil are anethol, methyl chavicol,\r\nd-pinene, l-phellandrene, and in older oils, the oxidation products of\r\nanethol, _viz._ anisic aldehyde and anisic acid. Since anethol is the\r\nmost valuable constituent, and the solidifying point of the oil is\r\nroughly proportional to its anethol content, oils with a higher\r\nsolidifying point are the best.\r\n\r\n_Aspic oil_, from the flowers of Lavandula spica, obtained from France\r\nand Spain, and extensively employed in perfuming household and cheap\r\ntoilet soaps; also frequently found as an adulterant in lavender oil.\r\nSpecific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.904-0.913; optical rotation, French,\r\ndextro-rotatory up to +4 deg., rarely up to +7 deg., Spanish, frequently\r\nslightly laevo-rotatory to -2 deg., or dextro-rotatory up to +7 deg.; esters,\r\ncalculated as linalyl acetate, 2 to 6 per cent.; most oils are soluble\r\nin 65 per cent. alcohol 1 in 4, in no case should more than 2.5 volumes\r\nof 70 per cent. alcohol be required for solution.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of the oil are: linalol, cineol, borneol,\r\nterpineol, geraniol, pinene, camphene and camphor.\r\n\r\n_Bay oil_, distilled from the leaves of Pimenta acris, and obtained from\r\nSt. Thomas and other West Indian Islands. It is used to some extent as a\r\nperfume for shaving soaps, but chiefly in the Bay Rhum toilet\r\npreparation. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.965-0.980; optical rotation,\r\nslightly laevo-rotatory up to -3 deg.; phenols, estimated by absorption with\r\n5 per cent. caustic potash solution, from 45 to 60 per cent.; the oil is\r\ngenerally insoluble in 90 per cent. alcohol, though when freshly\r\ndistilled it dissolves in its own volume of alcohol of this strength.\r\n\r\nThe oil contains eugenol, myrcene, chavicol, methyl eugenol, methyl\r\nchavicol, phellandrene, and citral.\r\n\r\n_Bergamot oil_, obtained by expression from the fresh peel of the fruit\r\nof Citrus Bergamia, and used very largely for the perfuming of toilet\r\nsoaps. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.880-0.886; optical rotation, +10 deg.\r\nto +20 deg.; esters, calculated as linalyl acetate, 35-40 per cent., and\r\noccasionally as high as 42-43 per cent.; frequently soluble in 1.5 parts\r\nof 80 per cent. alcohol, or failing that, should dissolve in one volume\r\nof 82.5 or 85 per cent. alcohol. When evaporated on the water-bath the\r\noil should not leave more than 5-6 per cent. residue.\r\n\r\nAmong the constituents of this oil are: linalyl acetate, limonene,\r\ndipentene, linalol, and bergaptene.\r\n\r\n_Bitter Almond Oil._--The volatile oil obtained from the fruit of\r\n_Amygdalus communis_. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 1.045-1.06; optically\r\ninactive; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.544-1.545; boiling point,\r\n176-177 deg. C.; soluble in 1 or 1.5 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe oil consists almost entirely of benzaldehyde which may be estimated\r\nby absorption with a hot saturated solution of sodium bisulphite. The\r\nchief impurity is prussic acid, which is not always completely removed.\r\nThis may be readily detected by adding to a small quantity of the oil\r\ntwo or three drops of caustic soda solution, and a few drops of ferrous\r\nsulphate solution containing ferric salt. After thoroughly shaking,\r\nacidulate with dilute hydrochloric acid, when a blue coloration will be\r\nproduced if prussic acid is present.\r\n\r\nThe natural oil may frequently be differentiated from artificial\r\nbenzaldehyde by the presence of chlorine in the latter. As there is now\r\non the market, however, artificial oil free from chlorine, it is no\r\nlonger possible, by chemical means, to distinguish with certainty\r\nbetween the natural and the artificial product. To test for chlorine in\r\na sample, a small coil of filter paper, loosely rolled, is saturated\r\nwith the oil, and burnt in a small porcelain dish, covered with an\r\ninverted beaker, the inside of which is moistened with distilled water.\r\nWhen the paper is burnt, the beaker is rinsed with water, filtered, and\r\nthe filtrate tested for chloride with silver nitrate solution.\r\n\r\n_Canada snake root oil_, from the root of Asarum canadense. Specific\r\ngravity at 15 deg. C., 0.940-0.962; optical rotation, slightly laevo-rotatory\r\nup to -4 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.485-1.490; saponification\r\nnumber, 100-115; soluble in 3 or 4 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe principal constituents of the oil are a terpene, asarol alcohol,\r\nanother alcohol, and methyl eugenol. The oil is too expensive to be used\r\nin other than high-class toilet soaps.\r\n\r\n_Cananga_ or _Kananga oil_, the earlier distillate from the flowers of\r\nCananga odorata, obtained chiefly from the Philippine Islands. Specific\r\ngravity at 15 deg. C., 0.910-0.940; optical rotation, -17 deg. to -30 deg.;\r\nrefractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.4994-1.5024; esters, calculated as linalyl\r\nbenzoate, 8-15 per cent.; soluble in 1.5 to 2 volumes of 95 per cent.\r\nalcohol, but becoming turbid on further addition.\r\n\r\nThe oil is qualitatively similar in composition to Ylang-Ylang oil, and\r\ncontains linalyl benzoate and acetate, esters of geraniol, cadinene, and\r\nmethyl ester of p-cresol.\r\n\r\n_Caraway oil_, distilled from the seeds of Carum carui. Specific gravity\r\nat 15 deg. C., 0.907-0.915; optical rotation, +77 deg. to +79 deg.; refractive index\r\nat 20 deg. C., 1.485-1.486; soluble in 3 to 8 volumes of 80 per cent.\r\nalcohol. The oil should contain 50-60 per cent. of carvone, which is\r\nestimated by absorption with a saturated solution of neutral sodium\r\nsulphite. The remainder of the oil consists chiefly of limonene.\r\n\r\n_Cassia oil_, distilled from the leaves of Cinnamomum cassia, and\r\nshipped to this country from China in lead receptacles. Specific gravity\r\nat 15 deg. C., 1.060-1.068; optical rotation, slightly dextro-rotatory up to\r\n+3 deg. 30'; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.6014-1.6048; soluble in 3 volumes\r\nof 70 per cent. alcohol as a general rule, but occasionally requires 1\r\nto 2 volumes of 80 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe value of the oil depends upon its aldehyde content, the chief\r\nconstituent being cinnamic aldehyde. This is determined by absorption\r\nwith a hot saturated solution of sodium bisulphite. Three grades are\r\nusually offered, the best containing 80-85 per cent. aldehydes, the\r\nsecond quality, 75-80 per cent., and the lowest grade, 70-75 per cent.\r\n\r\nOther constituents of the oil are cinnamyl acetate and cinnamic acid.\r\nThis oil gives the characteristic odour to Brown Windsor soap, and is\r\nuseful for sweetening coal-tar medicated soaps.\r\n\r\n_Cedarwood oil_, distilled from the wood of Juniperus virginiana.\r\nSpecific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.938-0.960; optical rotation, -35 deg. to -45 deg.;\r\nrefractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.5013-1.5030. The principal constituents\r\nare cedrene and cedrol.\r\n\r\n_Cinnamon oil_, distilled from the bark of Cinnamomum zeylanicum.\r\nSpecific gravity at 15 deg. C., 1.00-1.035; optical rotation, laevo-rotatory\r\nup to -2 deg.; usually soluble in 2 to 3 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol,\r\nbut sometimes requires 1 volume of 80 per cent. alcohol for solution;\r\naldehydes, by absorption with sodium bisulphite solution, 55-75 per\r\ncent.; and phenols, as measured by absorption with 5 per cent. potash,\r\nnot exceeding 12 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe value of this oil is not determined entirely by its aldehyde content\r\nas is the case with cassia oil, and any oil containing more than 75 per\r\ncent. aldehydes must be regarded with suspicion, being probably admixed\r\nwith either cassia oil or artificial cinnamic aldehyde. The addition of\r\ncinnamon leaf oil which has a specific gravity at 15 deg. C. of 1.044-1.065\r\nis detected by causing a material rise in the proportion of phenols.\r\nBesides cinnamic aldehyde the oil contains eugenol and phellandrene.\r\n\r\n_Citronella Oil._--This oil is distilled from two distinct Andropogon\r\ngrasses, the Lana Batu and the Maha pangiri, the former being the source\r\nof the bulk of Ceylon oil, and the latter being cultivated in the\r\nStraits Settlements and Java. The oils from these three localities show\r\nwell-defined chemical differences.\r\n\r\n_Ceylon Citronella oil_ has the specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.900-0.920;\r\noptical rotation, laevo-rotatory up to -12 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C.,\r\n1.480-1.484; soluble in 1 volume of 80 per cent. alcohol; total\r\nacetylisable constituents, calculated as geraniol, 54-70 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Singapore Citronella Oil._--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.890-0.899;\r\noptical rotation, usually slightly laevo-rotatory up to -3 deg.; refractive\r\nindex at 20 deg. C., 1.467-1.471; soluble in 1 to 1.5 volumes of 80 per\r\ncent. alcohol; total acetylisable constituents, calculated as geraniol,\r\n80-90 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Java Citronella Oil._--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.890-0.901; optical\r\nrotation, -1 deg. to -6 deg.; total acetylisable constituents, calculated as\r\ngeraniol, 75-90 per cent.; soluble in 1-2 volumes of 80 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of the oil are geraniol, citronellal, linalol,\r\nborneol, methyl eugenol, camphene, limonene, and dipentene. It is very\r\nlargely used for perfuming cheap soaps, and also serves as a source for\r\nthe production of geraniol.\r\n\r\n_Bois de Rose Femelle oil_, or _Cayenne linaloe oil_, distilled from\r\nwood of trees of the Burseraceae species. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C.,\r\n0.874-0.880; optical rotation, -11 deg. 30' to -16 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg.\r\nC., 1.4608-1.4630; soluble in 1.5 to 2 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe oil consists almost entirely of linalol, with traces of saponifiable\r\nbodies, but appears to be free from methyl heptenone, found by Barbier\r\nand Bouveault in Mexican linaloe oil. This oil is distinctly finer in\r\nodour than the Mexican product.\r\n\r\n_Clove oil_, distilled from the unripe blossoms of Eugenia\r\ncaryophyllata, the chief source of which is East Africa (Zanzibar and\r\nPemba). Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 1.045-1.061; optical rotation,\r\nslightly laevo-rotatory up to -1 deg. 30'; phenols, estimated by absorption\r\nwith 5 per cent. potash solution, 86-92 per cent.; refractive index at\r\n20 deg. C., 1.5300-1.5360; soluble in 1 to 2 volumes of 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nThe principal constituent of the oil is eugenol, together with\r\ncaryophyllene and acet-eugenol. While within certain limits the value of\r\nthis oil is determined by its eugenol content, oils containing more than\r\n93 per cent. phenols are usually less satisfactory in odour, the high\r\nproportion of phenols being obtained at the expense of the decomposition\r\nof some of the sesquiterpene. Oils with less than 88 per cent. phenols\r\nwill be found somewhat weak in odour. This oil is extensively used in\r\nthe cheaper toilet soaps and is an important constituent of carnation\r\nsoaps. As already mentioned, however, it causes the soap to darken in\r\ncolour somewhat rapidly, and must not therefore be used in any quantity,\r\nexcept in coloured soaps.\r\n\r\n_Concrete orris oil_, a waxy substance obtained by steam distillation of\r\nFlorentine orris root.\r\n\r\nMelting point, 35-45 deg. C., usually 40-45 deg. C.; free acidity, calculated as\r\nmyristic acid, 50-80 per cent.; ester, calculated as combined myristic\r\nacid, 4-10 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the product consists of the inodorous myristic acid,\r\nthe chief odour-bearing constituent being irone. The high price of the\r\noil renders its use only possible in the very best quality soaps.\r\n\r\n_Eucalyptus Oil._--Though there are some hundred or more different oils\r\nbelonging to this class, only two are of much importance to the\r\nsoap-maker. These are:--\r\n\r\n(i.) Eucalyptus citriodora. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.870-0.905;\r\noptical rotation, slightly dextro-rotatory up to +2 deg.; soluble in 4-5\r\nvolumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe oil consists almost entirely of citronellic aldehyde, and on\r\nabsorption with saturated solution of sodium bisulphite should leave\r\nvery little oil unabsorbed.\r\n\r\n(ii.) Eucalyptus globulus, the oil used in pharmacy, and containing\r\n50-65 per cent. cineol. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.910-0.930; optical\r\nrotation, +1 deg. to +10 deg.; soluble in 2 to 3 parts of 70 per cent. alcohol;\r\ncineol (estimated by combination with phosphoric acid, pressing,\r\ndecomposing with hot water, and measuring the liberated cineol), not\r\nless than 50 per cent. Besides cineol, the oil contains d-pinene, and\r\nvaleric, butyric, and caproic aldehydes. It is chiefly used in medicated\r\nsoaps.\r\n\r\n_Fennel (sweet) oil_, obtained from the fruit of Foeniculum vulgare,\r\ngrown in Germany, Roumania, and other parts of Europe. Specific gravity\r\nat 15 deg. C., 0.965-0.985; optical rotation, +6 deg. to +25 deg.; refractive index\r\nat 20 deg. C., 1.515-1.548; usually soluble in 2-6 parts 80 per cent.\r\nalcohol, but occasionally requires 1 part of 90 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of the oil are anethol, fenchone, d-pinene, and\r\ndipentene.\r\n\r\n_Geranium oils_, distilled from plants of the Pelargonium species.\r\nThere are three principal kinds of this oil on the market--the African,\r\nobtained from Algeria and the neighbourhood, the Bourbon, distilled\r\nprincipally in the Island of Reunion, and the Spanish. The oil is also\r\ndistilled from plants grown in the South of France, but this oil is not\r\nmuch used by soap-makers. A specially fine article is sold by a few\r\nessential oil firms under the name of \"Geranium-sur-Rose,\" which as its\r\nname implies, is supposed to be geranium oil distilled over roses. This\r\nis particularly suitable for use in high-class soaps. The following are\r\nthe general properties of these oils. It will be seen that the limits\r\nfor the figures overlap to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\n ___________________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                       |              |              |              |              |\r\n|                       |   African.   |   Bourbon.   |   Spanish.   |    French.   |\r\n|_______________________|______________|______________|______________|______________|\r\n|                       |              |              |              |              |\r\n| Specific gravity      |              |              |              |              |\r\n|   at 15 deg.

The African\r\nand Bourbon varieties are the two most commonly used for\r\nsoap-perfurmery, the Spanish oil being too costly for extensive use.\r\n\r\n_Ginger-grass oil_, formerly regarded as an inferior kind of palma-rosa\r\nbut now stated to be from an entirely different source. Specific gravity\r\nat 15 deg. C., 0.889-0.897; optical rotation, +15 deg.\r\n\r\nThe oil contains a large amount of geraniol, together with di-hydrocumin\r\nalcohol, d-phellandrene, d-limonene, dipentene, and l-carvone.\r\n\r\n_Guaiac wood oil_, distilled from the wood of Bulnesia sarmienti.\r\nSpecific gravity at 30 deg. C., 0.967-0.975; optical rotation, -4 deg. 30' to\r\n-7 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.506-1.507; soluble in 3 to 5 volumes\r\nof 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe principal constituent of the oil is guaiac alcohol, or gusiol. This\r\noil, which has what is generally termed a \"tea-rose odour,\" is\r\noccasionally used as an adulterant for otto of rose.\r\n\r\n_Lavender oil_, distilled from the flowers of Lavandula vera, grown in\r\nEngland, France, Italy and Spain. The English oil is considerably the\r\nmost expensive, and is seldom, if ever, used in soap. The French and\r\nItalian oils are the most common, the Spanish oil being a comparatively\r\nnew article, of doubtful botanical origin, and more closely resembling\r\naspic oil.\r\n\r\nEnglish Oil.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.883-0.900; optical rotation,\r\n-4 deg. to -10 deg.; esters, calculated as linalyl acetate, 5-10 per cent.;\r\nsoluble in 3 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nFrench and Italian Oils.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.885-0.900;\r\noptical rotation, -2 deg. to -9 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.459-1.464;\r\nesters, calculated as linalyl acetate, 20-40 per cent., occasionally\r\nhigher; soluble in 1.5-3 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThere was at one time a theory that the higher the proportion of ester\r\nthe better the oil, but this theory has now to a very large extent\r\nbecome discredited, and there is no doubt that some of the finest oils\r\ncontain less than 30 per cent. of esters.\r\n\r\nSpanish Oil.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.900-0.915; optical rotation,\r\n-2 deg. to +7 deg.; esters, calculated as linalyl acetate, 2-6 per cent.;\r\nsoluble in 1-2 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of lavender oil are linalyl acetate, linalol,\r\ngeraniol, and linalyl butyrate, while the English oil also contains a\r\ndistinct amount of cineol.\r\n\r\n_Lemon oil_, prepared by expressing the peel of the nearly ripe fruit of\r\nCitrus limonum, and obtained almost entirely from Sicily and Southern\r\nItaly. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.856-0.860; optical rotation, +58 deg.\r\nto +63 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.4730-1.4750; aldehydes (citral),\r\n2.5 to 4 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe principal constituents of the oil are limonene and citral, together\r\nwith small quantities of pinene, phellandrene, octyl and nonyl\r\naldehydes, citronellal, geraniol, geranyl acetate, and the stearopten,\r\ncitraptene.\r\n\r\n_Lemon-grass_ (so-called _verbena_) oil, distilled from the grass\r\nAndropogon citratus, which is grown in India and, more recently, in the\r\nWest Indies. The oils from these two sources differ somewhat in their\r\nproperties, and also in value, the former being preferred on account of\r\nits greater solubility in alcohol.\r\n\r\nEast Indian.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.898-0.906; optical rotation,\r\n-0 deg. 30' to -6 deg.; aldehydes, by absorption with bisulphite of soda\r\nsolution, 65 to 78 per cent.; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.485-1.487;\r\nsoluble in 2-3 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nWest Indian.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.886-0.893; optical rotation,\r\nfaintly laevo-gyrate; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.4855-1.4876; soluble\r\nin 0.5 volume of 90 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Lime oil_, obtained by expression or distillation of the peel of the\r\nfruit of Citrus medica, and produced principally in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nExpressed Oil.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.870-0.885; optical\r\nrotation, +38 deg. to +50 deg. Its most important constituent is citral.\r\n\r\nDistilled Oil.--This is entirely different in character to the expressed\r\noil. Its specific gravity at 15 deg. C. is 0.854-0.870; optical rotation,\r\n+38 deg. to +54 deg.; soluble in 5-8 volumes of 90 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Linaloe oil_, distilled from the wood of trees of the Burseraceae\r\nfamily, and obtained from Mexico. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C.,\r\n0.876-0.892; optical rotation, usually laevo-rotatory, -3 deg. to -13 deg., but\r\noccasionally dextro-rotatory up to +5 deg. 30'; esters, calculated as\r\nlinalyl acetate, 1-8 per cent.; total alcohols as linalol, determined by\r\nacetylation, 54-66 per cent.; soluble in 1-2 volumes of 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nThis oil consists mainly of linalol, together with small quantities of\r\nmethyl heptenone, geraniol, and d-terpineol.\r\n\r\n_Marjoram oil_, distilled from Origanum majoranoides, and obtained\r\nentirely from Cyprus. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.966; phenols,\r\nchiefly carvacrol, estimated by absorption with 5 per cent. caustic\r\npotash solution, 80-82 per cent.; soluble in 2-3 volumes of 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nThis oil is used in soap occasionally in place of red thyme oil.\r\n\r\n_Neroli Bigarade oil_, distilled from the fresh blossoms of the bitter\r\norange, Citrus bigaradia. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.875-0.882;\r\noptical rotation, +0 deg. 40' to +10 deg., and occasionally much higher;\r\nrefractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.468-1.470; esters, calculated as linalyl\r\nacetate, 10-18 per cent.; soluble in 0.75-1.75 volumes of 80 per cent.\r\nalcohol, becoming turbid on further addition of alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents of the oil are limonene, linalol, linalyl\r\nacetate, geraniol, methyl anthranilate, indol, and neroli camphor.\r\n\r\n_Orange (sweet) oil_, expressed from the peel of Citrus aurantium.\r\nSpecific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.849-0.852; optical rotation, +95 deg. to +99 deg.;\r\nrefractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.4726-1.4732.\r\n\r\nThe oil contains some 90 per cent. limonene, together with nonyl\r\nalcohol, d-linalol, d-terpineol, citral, citronellal, decyl aldehyde,\r\nand methyl anthranilate.\r\n\r\n_Palmarosa_, or _East Indian geranium oil_, distilled from Andropogon\r\nSchoenanthus, a grass widely grown in India. Specific gravity at 15 deg.\r\nC., 0.888-0.895; optical rotation, +1 deg. to -3 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg.\r\nC., 1.472-1.476; esters, calculated as linalyl acetate, 7-14 per cent.;\r\ntotal alcohols, as geraniol, 75-93 per cent.; solubility in 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol, 1 in 3.\r\n\r\nThe oil consists chiefly of geraniol, free, and combined with acetic and\r\ncaproic acids, and dipentene. It is largely used in cheap toilet soaps,\r\nparticularly in rose soaps. It is also a favourite adulterant for otto\r\nof rose, and is used as a source of geraniol.\r\n\r\n_Patchouli oil_, distilled from the leaves of Pogostemon patchouli, a\r\nherb grown in India and the Straits Settlements. Specific gravity at 15 deg.\r\nC., 0.965-0.990; optical rotation, -45 deg. to -63 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg.\r\nC., 1.504-1.511; saponification number, up to 12; sometimes soluble in\r\n0.5 to 1 volume of 90 per cent. alcohol, becoming turbid on further\r\naddition. The solubility of the oil in alcohol increases with age. The\r\noil consists to the extent of 97 per cent. of patchouliol and cadinene,\r\nwhich have little influence on its odour, and the bodies responsible for\r\nits persistent and characteristic odour have not yet been isolated.\r\n\r\n_Peppermint oil_, distilled from herbs of the Mentha family, the\r\nEuropean and American from Mentha piperita, and the Japanese being\r\ngenerally supposed to be obtained from Mentha arvensis. The locality in\r\nwhich the herb is grown has a considerable influence on the resulting\r\noil, as the following figures show:--\r\n\r\nEnglish.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.900-0.910; optical rotation,\r\n-22 deg. to -33 deg.; total menthol, 55-66 per cent.; free menthol, 50-60 per\r\ncent.; soluble in 3-5 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nAmerican.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.906-0.920; optical rotation,\r\n-20 deg. to -33 deg.; total menthol, 50-60 per cent.; free menthol, 40-50 per\r\ncent. The Michigan oil is soluble in 3-5 volumes of 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol, but the better Wayne County oil usually requires 1-2 volumes of\r\n80 per cent. alcohol, and occasionally 0.5 volume of 90 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nFrench.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.917-0.925; optical rotation, -6 deg.\r\nto -10 deg.; total menthol, 45-55 per cent.; free menthol, 35-45 per cent.;\r\nsoluble in 1 to 1.5 volumes of 80 per cent.\r\n\r\nJapanese.--Specific gravity at 25 deg. C., 0.895-0.900; optical rotation,\r\nlaevo-rotatory up to -43 deg.; solidifies at 17 to 27 deg. C.; total menthol,\r\n70-90 per cent., of which 65-85 per cent. is free; soluble in 3-5\r\nvolumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe dementholised oil is fluid at ordinary temperatures, has a specific\r\ngravity of 0.900-0.906 at 15 deg. C., and contains 50-60 per cent. total\r\nmenthol.\r\n\r\nSome twenty different constituents have been found in American\r\npeppermint oil, including menthol, menthone, menthyl acetate, cineol,\r\namyl alcohol, pinene, l-limonene, phellandrene, dimethyl sulphide,\r\nmenthyl isovalerianate, isovalerianic aldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetic\r\nacid, and isovalerianic acid.\r\n\r\n_Peru balsam oil_, the oily portion (so-called \"cinnamein\") obtained\r\nfrom Peru balsam. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 1.100-1.107; optical\r\nrotation, slightly dextro-rotatory up to +2 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg.\r\nC., 1.569 to 1.576; ester, calculated as benzyl benzoate, 80-87 per\r\ncent.; soluble in 1 volume of 90 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe oil consists chiefly of benzyl benzoate and cinnamate, together with\r\nstyracin, or cinnamyl cinnamate, and a small quantity of free benzoic\r\nand cinnamic acids.\r\n\r\n_Petitgrain oil_, obtained by distillation of the twigs and unripe fruit\r\nof Citrus bigaradia. There are two varieties of the oil, the French and\r\nthe South American, the former being the more valuable. Specific gravity\r\nat 15 deg. C., 0.886-0.900; optical rotation, -3 deg. to +6 deg.; refractive index\r\nat 20 deg. C., 1.4604-1.4650; esters, calculated as linalyl acetate, 40-55\r\nper cent., for the best qualities usually above 50 per cent.; soluble as\r\na rule in 2-3 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol, but occasionally requires\r\n1-2 volumes of 80 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nAmong its constituents are limonene, linalyl acetate, geraniol and\r\ngeranyl acetate.\r\n\r\n_Pimento oil_ (allspice), distilled from the fruit of Pimenta\r\nofficinalis, which is found in the West Indies and Central America.\r\nSpecific gravity at 15 deg. C., 1.040-1.060; optical rotation, slightly\r\nlaevo-rotatory up to -4 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.529-1.536;\r\nphenols, estimated by absorption with 5 per cent. potash solution,\r\n68-86 per cent.; soluble in 1-2 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe oil contains eugenol, methyl eugenol, cineol, phellandrene, and\r\ncaryophyllene.\r\n\r\n_Rose oil (otto of rose)_, distilled from the flowers of Rosa damascena,\r\nthough occasionally the white roses (Rosa alba) are employed. The\r\nprincipal rose-growing district is in Bulgaria, but a small quantity of\r\nrose oil is prepared from roses grown in Anatolia, Asia Minor. An\r\nopinion as to the purity of otto of rose can only be arrived at after a\r\nvery full chemical analysis, supplemented by critical examination of its\r\nodour by an expert. The following figures, however, will be found to\r\ninclude most oils which can be regarded as genuine. Specific gravity at\r\n30 deg. C., 0.850-0.858; optical rotation at 30 deg. C., -1 deg. 30' to -3 deg.;\r\nrefractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.4600-1.4645; saponification value, 7-11;\r\nsolidifying point, 19-22 deg. C.; iodine number, 187-194; stearopten\r\ncontent, 14-20 per cent.; melting point of stearopten, about 32 deg. C.\r\n\r\nA large number of constituents have been isolated from otto of rose,\r\nmany of which are, however, only present in very small quantities. The\r\nmost important are geraniol, citronellol, phenyl ethyl alcohol, together\r\nwith nerol, linalol, citral, nonylic aldehyde, eugenol, a sesquiterpene\r\nalcohol, and the paraffin stearopten.\r\n\r\n_Rosemary oil_, distilled from the herb Rosemarinus officinalis, and\r\nobtained from France, Dalmatia, and Spain. The herb is also grown in\r\nEngland, but the oil distilled therefrom is rarely met with in commerce.\r\nThe properties of the oils vary with their source, and also with the\r\nparts of the plant distilled, distillation of the stalks as well as the\r\nleaves tending to reduce the specific gravity and borneol content, and\r\nincrease the proportion of the laevo-rotatory constituent (laevo-pinene).\r\nThe following figures may be taken as limits for pure oils:--\r\n\r\nFrench and Dalmatian.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.900-0.916; optical\r\nrotation, usually dextro-rotatory, up to +15 deg., but may occasionally be\r\nlaevo-rotatory, especially if stalks have been distilled with the leaves;\r\nester, calculated as bornyl acetate, 1-6 per cent.; total borneol, 12-18\r\nper cent.; usually soluble in 1-2 volumes of 82.5 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nSpanish.--The properties of the Spanish oil are similar to the others,\r\nexcept that it is more frequently laevo-rotatory.\r\n\r\nRosemary oil contains pinene, camphene, cineol, borneol, and camphor.\r\n\r\n_Sandalwood oil_, obtained by distillation of the wood of Santalum album\r\n(East Indian), Santalum cygnorum (West Australian), and Amyris\r\nbalsamifera (West Indian). The oils obtained from these three different\r\nsources differ very considerably in value, the East Indian being by far\r\nthe best.\r\n\r\nEast Indian.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.975-0.980; optical rotation,\r\n-14 deg. to -20 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.5045-1.5060; santalol,\r\n92-97 per cent.; usually soluble in 4-6 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol,\r\nthough, an old oil occasionally is insoluble in 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nWest Australian.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.950-0.968; optical\r\nrotation, +5 deg. to +7 deg.; alcohols, calculated as santalol, 73-75 per cent.;\r\ninsoluble in 70 per cent. alcohol, but readily dissolves in 1-2 volumes\r\nof 80 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nWest Indian.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.948-0.967; optical rotation,\r\n+13 deg. 30' to +30 deg.; insoluble in 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn addition to free santalol, the oil contains esters of santalol and\r\nsantalal.\r\n\r\n_Sassafras oil_, distilled from the bark of Sassafras officinalis, and\r\nobtained chiefly from America. Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 1.06-1.08;\r\noptical rotation, +1 deg. 50' to +4 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C.,\r\n1.524-1.532; soluble in, 6-10 volumes of 85 per cent. alcohol,\r\nfrequently soluble in 10-15 volumes of 80 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe chief constituents are safrol, pinene, eugenol, camphor, and\r\nphellandrene. The removal of safrol, either intentionally or by\r\naccident, owing to cooling of the oil and consequent deposition of the\r\nsafrol, is readily detected by the reduction of the specific gravity\r\nbelow 1.06.\r\n\r\n_Thyme oil, red and white_, distilled from the green or dried herb,\r\nThymus vulgaris, both French and Spanish oils being met with. These oils\r\nare entirely different in character.\r\n\r\nFrench.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.91-0.933; slightly laevo-rotatory\r\nup to -4 deg., but usually too dark to observe; phenols, by absorption with\r\n10 per cent. aqueous caustic potash, 25-55 per cent.; refractive index\r\nat 20 deg. C., 1.490-1.500; soluble in 1-1.5 volumes of 80 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nSpanish.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.955-0.966; optical rotation,\r\nslightly laevo-gyrate; phenols, 70-80 per cent.; refractive index at 20 deg.\r\nC.; 1.5088-1.5122; soluble in 2-3 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the phenols, thymol or carvacrol, these oils contain\r\ncymene, thymene and pinene.\r\n\r\nThe white thyme oil is produced by rectifying the red oil, which is\r\ngenerally effected at the expense of a considerable reduction in phenol\r\ncontent, and hence in real odour value of the oil.\r\n\r\n_Verbena Oil._--The oil usually sold under this name is really\r\nlemon-grass oil (which see _supra_). The true verbena oil or French\r\nverveine is, however, occasionally met with. This is distilled in France\r\nfrom the verbena officinalis, and has the following properties: Specific\r\ngravity at 15 deg. C., 0.891-0.898; optical rotation, slightly dextro- or\r\nlaevo-rotatory; aldehydes, 70-75 per cent.; soluble in 2 volumes of 70\r\nper cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe oil contains citral.\r\n\r\n_Vetivert oil_, distilled from the grass, Andropogon muricatus, or Cus\r\nCus, and grown in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity at 15 deg. C., 1.01-1.03; optical rotation, +20 deg. to +26 deg.;\r\nsaponification number, 15-30; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.521-1.524;\r\nsoluble in 2 volumes of 80 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe price of this oil makes its use prohibitive except in the highest\r\nclass soaps.\r\n\r\n_Wintergreen Oil._--There are two natural sources of this oil, the\r\nGaultheria procumbens and the Betula lenta. Both oils consist almost\r\nentirely of methyl salicylate and are practically identical in\r\nproperties, the chief difference being that the former has a slight\r\nlaevo-rotation, while the latter is inactive.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity at 15 deg. C., 1.180-1.187; optical rotation, Gaultheria\r\noil, up to -1 deg., Betula oil, inactive; ester as methyl salicylate, at\r\nleast 98 per cent.; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.5354-1.5364; soluble\r\nin 2-6 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nBesides methyl salicylate, the oil contains triaconitane, an aldehyde or\r\nketone, and an alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Ylang-ylang oil_, distilled from the flowers of Cananga odorata, the\r\nchief sources being the Philippine Islands and Java. Specific gravity at\r\n15 deg. C., 0.924-0.950; optical rotation, -30 deg. to -60 deg., and occasionally\r\nhigher; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.496-1.512; ester, calculated as\r\nlinalyl benzoate, 27-45 per cent., occasionally up to 50 per cent.;\r\nusually soluble in 1/2 volume of 90 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the oil is qualitatively the same as that of Cananga\r\noil, but it is considerably more expensive and therefore can only be\r\nused in the highest grade soaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artificial and Synthetic Perfumes._\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years the constitution of essential oils has been\r\nstudied by a considerable number of chemists, and the composition of\r\nmany oils has been so fully determined that very good imitations can\r\noften be made at cheaper prices than those of the genuine oils,\r\nrendering it possible to produce cheap soaps having perfumes which were\r\nformerly only possible in the more expensive article.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable distinction, however, often lost sight of,\r\nbetween an _artificial_ and a _synthetic_ oil. An artificial oil may be\r\nproduced by separating various constituents from certain natural oils,\r\nand so blending these, with or without the addition of other substances,\r\nas to produce a desired odour, the perfume being, at any rate in part,\r\nobtained from natural oils. A synthetic perfume, on the other hand, is\r\nentirely the product of the chemical laboratory, no natural oil or\r\nsubstance derived therefrom entering into its composition.\r\n\r\nThe following are among the most important bodies of this class:--\r\n\r\n_Amyl salicylate_, the ester prepared from amyl alcohol and salicylic\r\nacid, sometimes known as \"Orchidee\" or \"Trefle\". This is much used for\r\nthe production of a clover-scented soap. It has the specific gravity at\r\n15 deg. C., 1.052-1.054; optical rotation, +1 deg. 16' to +1 deg. 40'; refractive\r\nindex at 20 deg. C., 1.5056; and should contain not less than 97 per cent.\r\nester, calculated as amyl salicylate.\r\n\r\n_Anisic aldehyde_, or _aubepine_, prepared by oxidation of anethol, and\r\npossessing a pleasant, hawthorn odour. This has the specific gravity at\r\n15 deg. C., 1.126; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.5693; is optically\r\ninactive, and dissolves readily in one volume of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Benzyl Acetate_, the ester obtained from benzyl alcohol and acetic\r\nacid. This has a very strong and somewhat coarse, penetrating odour,\r\ndistinctly resembling jasmine. Its specific gravity at 15 deg. C. is\r\n1.062-1.065; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.5020; and it should contain\r\nat least 97-98 per cent. ester, calculated as benzyl acetate.\r\n\r\n_Citral_, the aldehyde occurring largely in lemon-grass and verbena\r\noils, also to a less extent in lemon and orange oils, and possessing an\r\nintense lemon-like odour. It has a specific gravity at 15 deg. C.,\r\n0.896-0.897, is optically inactive, and should be entirely absorbed by a\r\nhot saturated solution of sodium bisulphite.\r\n\r\n_Citronellal_, an aldehyde possessing the characteristic odour of\r\ncitronella oil, in which it occurs to the extent of about 20 per cent.,\r\nand constituting considerably over 90 per cent. of eucalyptus citriodora\r\noil. Its specific gravity at 15 deg. C. is 0.862; refractive index at 20 deg.\r\nC., 1.447; optical rotation, +8 deg. to +12 deg.; and it should be entirely\r\nabsorbed by a hot saturated solution of sodium bisulphite.\r\n\r\n_Coumarin_, a white crystalline product found in Tonka beans, and\r\nprepared synthetically from salicylic acid. It has an odour resembling\r\nnew-mown hay, and melts at 67 deg. C.\r\n\r\n_Geraniol_, a cyclic alcohol, occurring largely in geranium, palma-rosa,\r\nand citronella oils. Its specific gravity at 15 deg. C. is 0.883-0.885;\r\nrefractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.4762-1.4770; it is optically inactive, and\r\nboils at 218 deg.-225 deg. C.\r\n\r\n_Heliotropin_, which possesses the characteristic odour of heliotrope,\r\nis prepared artificially from safrol. It crystallises in small prisms\r\nmelting at 86 deg. C.\r\n\r\n_Hyacinth._--Most of the articles sold under this name are secret blends\r\nof the different makers. Styrolene has an odour very much resembling\r\nhyacinth, and probably forms the basis of most of these preparations,\r\ntogether with terpineol, and other artificial bodies. The properties of\r\nthe oil vary considerably for different makes.\r\n\r\n_Ionone_, a ketone first prepared by Tiemann, and having when diluted a\r\npronounced violet odour. It is prepared by treating a mixture of citral\r\nand acetone with barium hydrate, and distilling in vacuo. Two isomeric\r\nketones, [alpha]-ionone and [beta]-ionone, are produced, the article\r\nof commerce being usually a mixture of both. The two ketones have the\r\nfollowing properties:--\r\n\r\nAlpha-ionone.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.9338; refractive index at\r\n16.5 C., 1.50048 (Chuit); optically it is inactive.\r\n\r\nBeta-ionone.--Specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.9488; refractive index at\r\n16.8 deg. C., 1.52070 (Chuit); optically it is inactive also.\r\n\r\nThe product is usually sold in 10 or 20 per cent. alcoholic solution\r\nready for use.\r\n\r\n_Jasmine._--This is one of the few cases in which the artificial oil is\r\nprobably superior to that obtained from the natural flowers, possibly\r\ndue to the extreme delicacy of the odour, and its consequent slight\r\ndecomposition during preparation from the flowers. The chemical\r\ncomposition of the floral perfume has been very exhaustively studied,\r\nand the artificial article now on the market may be described as a\r\ntriumph of synthetical chemistry. Among its constituents are benzyl\r\nacetate, linalyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, indol, methyl anthranilate,\r\nand a ketone jasmone.\r\n\r\n_Linalol_, the alcohol forming the greater part of linaloe and bois de\r\nrose oils, and found also in lavender, neroli, petitgrain, bergamot, and\r\nmany other oils. The article has the specific gravity at 15 deg. C.,\r\n0.870-0.876; optical rotation, -12 deg. to -14 deg.; refractive index at 20 deg. C.,\r\n1.463-1.464; and when estimated by acetylation, yields about 70 per\r\ncent. of alcohols.\r\n\r\n_Linalyl acetate_, or _artificial bergamot oil_, is the ester formed\r\nwhen linalol is treated with acetic anhydride. It possesses a\r\nbergamot-like odour, but it is doubtful whether its value is\r\ncommensurate with its greatly increased price over that of ordinary\r\nbergamot oil. It has the specific gravity at 15 deg. C., 0.912.\r\n\r\n_Musk (Artificial)._--Several forms of this are to be obtained,\r\npractically all of which are nitro-derivatives of aromatic hydrocarbons.\r\nThe original patent of Baur, obtained in 1889, covered the\r\ntri-nitro-derivative of tertiary butyl xylene. The melting point of the\r\npure article usually lies between 108 deg. and 112 deg. C., and the solubility\r\nin 95 per cent. alcohol ranges from 1 in 120 to 1 in 200, though more\r\nsoluble forms are also made.\r\n\r\nAn important adulterant, which should always be tested for, is\r\nacetanilide (antifebrin), which may be detected by the characteristic\r\nisocyanide odour produced when musk containing this substance is boiled\r\nwith alcoholic potash, and a few drops of chloroform added. Acetanilide\r\nalso increases the solubility in 95 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Neroli Oil (Artificial)._--Like jasmine oil, the chemistry of neroli\r\noil is now very fully known, and it is therefore possible to prepare an\r\nartificial product which is a very good approximation to the natural\r\noil, and many such are now on the market, which, on account of their\r\ncomparative cheapness, commend themselves to the soap-perfumer. These\r\nconsist chiefly of linalol, geraniol, linalyl acetate, methyl\r\nanthranilate, and citral.\r\n\r\n_Mirbane Oil_ or _Nitrobenzene._--This is a cheap substitute for oil of\r\nbitter almonds, or benzaldehyde, and is a very coarse, irritating\r\nperfume, only suitable for use in the very cheapest soaps. It is\r\nprepared by the action of a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids on\r\nbenzene at a temperature not exceeding 40 deg. C. Its specific gravity is\r\n1.205-1.206; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.550; and boiling point, 206 deg.\r\nC.\r\n\r\n_Niobe oil_, or _ethyl benzoate_, the ester obtained from ethyl alcohol\r\nand benzoic acid, and having the specific gravity at 15 deg. C.,\r\n1.094-1.095; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.5167; boiling point,\r\n196.5 deg.-198 deg. C.; soluble in 1.5 volumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Oeillet_ is a combination possessed of a sweet carnation-like odour and\r\nhaving as a basis, eugenol or isoeugenol. Its properties vary with the\r\nsource of supply.\r\n\r\n_Rose Oil (Artificial)._--Several good and fairly cheap artificial rose\r\noils are now obtainable, consisting chiefly of citronellol, geraniol,\r\nlinalol, phenyl ethyl alcohol, and citral. In some cases stearopten or\r\nother wax is added, to render the oil more similar in appearance to the\r\nnatural article, but as these are inodorous, no advantage is gained in\r\nthis way, and there is, further, the inconvenience in cold weather of\r\nhaving to first melt the oil before use.\r\n\r\n_Safrol_, an ether which is the chief constituent of sassafras oil, and\r\nalso found in considerable quantity in camphor oil. It is sold as an\r\nartificial sassafras oil, and is very much used in perfuming cheap\r\ntoilet or household soaps. Its specific gravity at 15 deg. C. is\r\n1.103-1.106; refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.5373; and it dissolves in\r\nfifteen volumes of 80 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Santalol_, the alcohol or mixture of alcohols obtained from sandalwood\r\noil. Its specific gravity at 15 deg. C. is 0.9795; optical rotation, -18 deg.;\r\nand refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.507.\r\n\r\n_Terebene_, a mixture of dipentene and other hydrocarbons prepared from\r\nturpentine oil by treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid, is used\r\nchiefly in medicated soaps. Its specific gravity at 15 deg. C. is\r\n0.862-0.868; the oil is frequently slightly dextro- or laevo-rotatory;\r\nthe refractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.470-1.478.\r\n\r\n_Terpineol_, an alcohol also prepared from turpentine oil by the action\r\nof sulphuric acid, terpene hydrate being formed as an intermediate\r\nsubstance. It has a distinctly characteristic lilac odour, and on\r\naccount of its cheapness is much used in soap perfumery, especially for\r\na lilac or lily soap. Its specific gravity at 15 deg. C. is 0.936-0.940;\r\nrefractive index at 20 deg. C., 1.4812-1.4835; and boiling point about\r\n210 deg.-212 deg. C. It is optically inactive, and readily soluble in 1.5\r\nvolumes of 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Vanillin_, a white crystalline solid, melting at 80 deg.-82 deg. C. and\r\nprepared by the oxidation of isoeugenol. It has a strong characteristic\r\nodour, and occurs, associated with traces of benzoic acid and\r\nheliotropin, in the vanilla bean. It can only be used in small quantity\r\nin light-coloured soaps, as it quickly tends to darken the colour of the\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nGLYCERINE MANUFACTURE AND PURIFICATION.\r\n\r\n     _Treatment of Lyes--Evaporation to Crude\r\n     Glycerine--Distillation--Distilled and Dynamite\r\n     Glycerine--Chemically Pure Glycerine--Animal Charcoal for\r\n     Decolorisation--Glycerine obtained by other Methods of\r\n     Saponification--Yield of Glycerine from Fats and Oils._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in Chapter II. the fatty acids, which, combined with soda\r\nor potash, form soap, occur in nature almost invariably in the form of\r\nglycerides, _i.e._, compounds of fatty acids with glycerol, and as the\r\nresult of saponification of a fat or oil glycerine is set free.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter V. processes of soap-making are described in which (1) the\r\nglycerine is retained in the finished soap, and (2) the glycerine is\r\ncontained in the lyes, in very dilute solution, contaminated with salt\r\nand other impurities. These lyes, though now constituting the chief\r\nsource of profit in the manufacture of cheap soaps, were till early in\r\nlast century simply run down the drains as waste liquor.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been devoted to the purification and concentration of\r\nglycerine lyes; and elaborate plant of various forms has been devised\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Lyes._--The spent lyes withdrawn from the soap-pans are\r\ncooled, and the soap, which has separated during the cooling, is\r\ncarefully removed and returned to the soap-house for utilisation in the\r\nmanufacture of brown soap. Spent lyes may vary in their content of\r\nglycerol from 3 to 8 per cent., and this depends not only upon the\r\nsystem adopted in the working of the soap-pans, but also upon the\r\nmaterials used. Although, in these days of pure caustic soda, spent lyes\r\nare more free from impurities than formerly, the presence of sulphides\r\nand sulphites should be carefully avoided, if it is desired to produce\r\ngood glycerine.\r\n\r\nThe lyes are transferred to a lead-lined tank of convenient size, and\r\ntreated with commercial hydrochloric acid and aluminium sulphate,\r\nsufficient being added of the former to neutralise the free alkali, and\r\nrender the liquor faintly acid, and of the latter to completely\r\nprecipitate the fatty acids. The acid should be run in slowly, and the\r\npoint when enough has been added, is indicated by blue litmus paper\r\nbeing slightly reddened by the lyes.\r\n\r\nThe whole is then agitated with air, when a sample taken from the tank\r\nand filtered should give a clear filtrate.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained this clear solution, agitation is stopped, and the\r\ncontents of the tank passed through a filter press. The scum, which\r\naccumulates on the treatment tank, may be transferred to a perforated\r\nbox suspended over the tank, and the liquor allowed to drain from it.\r\nThe filtered liquor is now rendered slightly alkaline by the addition of\r\ncaustic soda or carbonate, and, after filtering, is ready for\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nThe acid and alum salt used in the above treatment must be carefully\r\nexamined for the presence of arsenic, and any deliveries of either\r\narticle, which contain that impurity, rejected.\r\n\r\nLime, bog ore, and various metallic salts, such as ferric chloride,\r\nbarium chloride, and copper sulphate have been suggested, and in some\r\ninstances are used instead of aluminium sulphate, but the latter is\r\ngenerally employed.\r\n\r\n_Evaporation to Crude Glycerine._--The clear treated lyes, being now\r\nfree from fatty, resinous, and albuminous matter, and consisting\r\npractically of an aqueous solution of common salt (sodium chloride) and\r\nglycerine, is converted into crude glycerine by concentration, which\r\neliminates the water and causes most of the salt to be deposited.\r\n\r\nThis concentration was originally performed in open pans heated by fire\r\nor waste combustible gases. In the bottom of each pan was placed a dish\r\nin which the salt deposited, and this dish was lifted out periodically\r\nby the aid of an overhead crane and the contents emptied and washed.\r\nConcentration was continued until the temperature of the liquor was 300 deg.\r\nF. (149 deg. C.), when it was allowed to rest before storing.\r\n\r\nThis liquor on analysis gave 80 per cent. glycerol and from 9 to 10-1/2\r\nper cent. salts (ash); hence the present standard for crude glycerine.\r\n\r\nConcentration in open pans has now been superseded by evaporation _in\r\nvacuo_. The subject of the gradual development of the modern efficient\r\nevaporating plant from the vacuum pan, originated and successfully\r\napplied by Howard in 1813 in the sugar industry, is too lengthy to\r\ndetail here, suffice it to say that the multiple effects now in vogue\r\npossess distinct advantages--the greatest of these being increased\r\nefficiency combined with economy.\r\n\r\nThe present type of evaporator consists of one or more vessels, each\r\nfitted with a steam chamber through which are fixed vertical hollow\r\ntubes. The steam chamber of the first vessel is heated with direct\r\nsteam, or with exhaust steam (supplied from the exhaust steam receiver\r\ninto which passes the waste steam of the factory); the treated lyes\r\ncirculating through the heated tubes is made to boil at a lower\r\ntemperature, with the reduced pressure, than is possible by heating in\r\nopen pans.\r\n\r\nThe vapour given off by the boiling liquor is conveyed through large\r\npipes into the steam chamber of the second vessel, where its latent heat\r\nis utilised in producing evaporation, the pressure being further\r\nreduced, as this second vessel is under a greater vacuum than No. 1.\r\nThus we get a \"double effect,\" as the plant consisting of two pans is\r\ntermed. The vapours discharged from the second vessel during boiling are\r\npassed through pipes to the steam chamber of the third vessel (in a\r\n\"triple effect\"), and there being condensed, create a partial vacuum in\r\nthe second vessel. The third vessel may also be heated by means of live\r\nsteam. The vapours arising from the last vessel of the evaporating\r\nplant, or in the case of a \"single effect\" from the vessel, are conveyed\r\ninto a condenser and condensed by injection water, which is drawn off by\r\nmeans of the pump employed for maintaining a vacuum of 28 inches in the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent designs of large evaporative installations, the\r\nvapours generated from the last vessel are drawn through a device\r\nconsisting of a number of tubes enclosed in a casing, and the latent\r\nheat raises the temperature of the treated lyes proceeding through the\r\ntubes to supply the evaporator.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be observed that the object of multiple effects is to\r\nutilise all the available heat in performing the greatest possible\r\namount of work. Special devices are attached to the plant for\r\nautomatically removing the condensed water from the steam chambers\r\nwithout the loss of useful heat, and as a precaution against splashing\r\nover and subsequent loss of glycerine through conveyance to the steam\r\nchamber, dash plates and \"catch-alls\" or \"save-alls\" of various designs\r\nare fitted on each vessel.\r\n\r\nIn working the plant, the liquor in each vessel is kept at a fairly\r\nconstant level by judicious feeding from one to the other; the first\r\nvessel is, of course, charged with treated lyes. As the liquor acquires\r\na density of 42 deg. Tw. (25 deg. B.) salt begins to deposit, and may be\r\nwithdrawn into one of the many patented appliances, in which it is freed\r\nfrom glycerine, washed and dried ready for use at the soap pans.\r\nDifficulty is sometimes experienced with the tubes becoming choked with\r\nsalt, thereby diminishing and retarding evaporation. It may be necessary\r\nto dissolve the encrusted salt with lyes or water, but with careful\r\nworking the difficulty can be obviated by washing out with weak lyes\r\nafter each batch of crude glycerine has been run away, or by increasing\r\nthe circulation.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that by the use of the revolving heater designed by\r\nLewkowitsch, the salting up of tubes is prevented.\r\n\r\nThe salt having been precipitated and removed, evaporation is continued\r\nuntil a sample taken from the last vessel has a density of 60 deg. Tw. (33.3\r\nB.) at 60 deg. F. (15.5 deg. C.). When this point is reached, the crude\r\nglycerine is ready to be withdrawn into a tank, and, after allowing the\r\nexcess of salt to deposit, may be transferred to the storage tank.\r\n\r\nThe colour of crude glycerine varies from light brown to dark brown,\r\nalmost black, and depends largely on the materials used for soap-making.\r\nThe organic matter present in good crude glycerine is small in amount,\r\noften less than 1 per cent.; arsenic, sulphides and sulphites should be\r\nabsent. Crude glycerine is refined in some cases by the producers\r\nthemselves; others sell it to firms engaged more particularly in the\r\nrefined glycerine trade.\r\n\r\n_Distillation._--Crude glycerine is distilled under vacuum with the aid\r\nof superheated steam. The still is heated directly with a coal or coke\r\nfire, and in this fire space is the superheater, which consists of a\r\ncoil of pipes through which high pressure steam from the boiler is\r\nsuperheated.\r\n\r\nThe distillation is conducted at a temperature of 356 deg.F. (180 deg. C.). To\r\nprevent the deposition and burning of salt on the still-bottom during\r\nthe distillation, a false bottom is supported about 1 foot from the base\r\nof the still. With the same object in view, it has been suggested to\r\nrotate the contents with an agitator fixed in the still.\r\n\r\nEvery care is taken that the still does not become overheated; this\r\nprecaution not only prevents loss of glycerine through carbonisation,\r\nbut also obviates the production of tarry and other bodies which might\r\naffect the colour, taste, and odour of the distilled glycerine. The\r\nvacuum to be used will, of course, depend upon the heat of the fire and\r\nstill, but as a general rule good results are obtained with an 18 inch\r\nvacuum.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a large number of designs for still heads, and\r\n\"catch-alls,\" having for their object the prevention of loss of\r\nglycerine.\r\n\r\nThe distillate passes into a row of condensers, to each of which is\r\nattached a receptacle or receiver. It is needless to state that the\r\ncondensing capacity should be in excess of theoretical requirements. The\r\nfractions are of varying strengths and quality; that portion, with a\r\ndensity less than 14 deg. Tw. (19.4 deg. B.), is returned to the treated-lyes\r\ntank. The other portion of the distillate is concentrated by means of a\r\ndry steam coil in a suitable vessel under a 28 inch vacuum.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently concentrated the glycerine may be decolorised, if\r\nnecessary, by treating with 1 per cent. animal charcoal and passing\r\nthrough a filter press, from which it issues as \"dynamite glycerine\".\r\n\r\nThe residue in the still, consisting of 50-60 per cent. glycerine and\r\nvarying proportions of various sodium salts--_e.g._ acetate, chloride,\r\nsulphate, and combinations with non-volatile organic acids--is generally\r\nboiled with water and treated with acid.\r\n\r\nThe tar, which is separated, floats on the surface as the liquor is\r\ncooling, and may be removed by ladles, or the whole mixed with waste\r\ncharcoal, and filtered.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate is then evaporated, when the volatile organic acids are\r\ndriven off; the concentrated liquor is finally mixed with crude\r\nglycerine which is ready for distillation, or it may be distilled\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n_Distilled Glycerine._--This class of commercial glycerine, although of\r\nlimited use in various other branches of industry, finds its chief\r\noutlet in the manufacture of explosives.\r\n\r\nSpecifications are usually given in contracts drawn up between buyers\r\nand sellers, to which the product must conform.\r\n\r\nThe chief stipulation for dynamite glycerine is its behaviour in the\r\nnitration test. When glycerine is gradually added to a cold mixture of\r\nstrong nitric and sulphuric acids, it is converted into nitro-glycerine,\r\nwhich separates as an oily layer on the surface of the acid. The more\r\ndefinite and rapid the separation, the more suitable is the glycerine\r\nfor dynamite-making.\r\n\r\nDynamite glycerine should be free from arsenic, lime, chlorides, and\r\nfatty acids, the inorganic matter should not amount to more than 0.1 per\r\ncent., and a portion diluted and treated with nitrate of silver solution\r\nshould give no turbidity or discoloration in ten minutes. The specific\r\ngravity should be 1.262 at 15 deg. C. (59 deg. F.) and the colour somewhat\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\n_Chemically pure glycerine_ or double distilled glycerine is produced by\r\nredistilling \"once distilled\" glycerine. Every care is taken to avoid\r\nall fractions which do not withstand the nitrate of silver test. The\r\ndistillation is very carefully performed under strict supervision.\r\n\r\nThe distillate is concentrated and after treatment with animal charcoal\r\nand filtration should conform to the requirements of the British\r\nPharmacopoeia. These are specified as follows: Specific gravity at\r\n15.5 deg. C., 1.260. It should yield no characteristic reaction with the\r\ntests for lead, copper, arsenium, iron, calcium, potassium, sodium,\r\nammonium, chlorides, or sulphates. It should contain no sugars and leave\r\nno residue on burning.\r\n\r\n_Animal Charcoal for Decolorisation._--The application of animal\r\ncharcoal for decolorising purposes dates back a century, and various are\r\nthe views that have been propounded to explain its action. Some\r\nobservers base it upon the physical condition of the so-called carbon\r\npresent, and no doubt this is an important factor, coupled with the\r\nporosity. Others consider that the nitrogen, which is present in all\r\nanimal charcoal and extremely difficult to remove, is essential to the\r\naction. Animal charcoal should be freed from gypsum (sulphate of lime),\r\nlest in the burning, sulphur compounds be formed which would pass into\r\nthe glycerine and contaminate it.\r\n\r\nThe \"char\" should be well boiled with water, then carbonate of soda or\r\ncaustic soda added in sufficient quantity to give an alkaline reaction,\r\nand again well boiled. The liquor is withdrawn and the charcoal washed\r\nuntil the washings are no longer alkaline. The charcoal is then\r\nseparated from the liquor and treated with hydrochloric acid; opinions\r\ndiffer as to the amount of acid to be used. Some contend that phosphate\r\nof lime plays such an important part in decolorising that it should not\r\nbe removed, but it has, however, been demonstrated that this substance\r\nafter exposure to heat has very little decolorising power.\r\n\r\nAnimal charcoal boiled with four times its weight of a mixture\r\nconsisting of equal parts of commercial hydrochloric acid (free from\r\narsenic) and water for twelve hours, then washed free from acid, dried,\r\nand burned in closed vessels gives a product possessed of great\r\ndecolorising power for use with glycerines.\r\n\r\nA good animal charcoal will have a dull appearance, and be of a deep\r\ncolour; it should be used in fine grains and not in the form of a\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal from the filter presses is washed free from glycerine\r\n(which is returned to the treated lyes), cleansed from foreign\r\nsubstances by the above treatment and revivified by carefully heating in\r\nclosed vessels for twelve hours.\r\n\r\n_Glycerine obtained by other Methods of Saponification._--French\r\nsaponification or \"candle crude\" glycerine is the result of\r\nconcentration of \"sweet water\" produced in the manufacture of stearine\r\nand by the autoclave process. It contains 85-90 per cent. glycerol,\r\npossesses a specific gravity of 1.240-1.242, and may be readily\r\ndistinguished from the soap-crude glycerine by the absence of salt\r\n(sodium chloride). This glycerine is easily refined by treatment with\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\nThe glycerine water resulting from acid saponification methods requires\r\nto be rendered alkaline by the addition of lime--the sludge is\r\nseparated, and the liquor evaporated to crude. The concentration may be\r\nperformed in two stages--first to a density of 32 deg. Tw. (20 deg. B.), when\r\nthe calcium sulphate is allowed to deposit, and the separated liquor\r\nconcentrated to 48 deg. Tw. (28 deg. B.) glycerine, testing 85 per cent.\r\nglycerol and upwards.\r\n\r\n_Yield of Glycerine from Fats and Oils._--The following represent\r\npracticable results which should be obtained from the various\r\nmaterials:--\r\n\r\n    Tallow                 9 per cent. of 80 per cent. Glycerol.\r\n    Cotton-seed oil       10    \"\r\n    Cocoa-nut oil         12    \"\r\n    Palm-kernel oil       18    \"\r\n    Olive oil             10    \"\r\n    Palm oil               6    \"\r\n    Greases (Bone fats)  6-8    \"\r\n\r\nThe materials vary in glycerol content with the methods of preparation;\r\nespecially is this the case with tallows and greases.\r\n\r\nEvery care should be taken that the raw materials are fresh and they\r\nshould be carefully examined to ascertain if any decomposition has taken\r\nplace in the glycerides--this would be denoted by the presence of an\r\nexcess of free acidity, and the amount of glycerol obtainable from such\r\na fat would be correspondingly reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF RAW MATERIALS, SOAP, AND GLYCERINE.\r\n\r\n     _Fats and Oils--Alkalies and Alkali Salts--Essential\r\n     Oils--Soap--Lyes--Crude Glycerine._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Raw Materials._--Average figures have already been given in Chapters\r\nIII. and VIII. for the more important physical and chemical\r\ncharacteristics of fats and oils, also of essential oils; the following\r\nis an outline of the processes usually adopted in their determination.\r\nFor fuller details, text-books dealing exhaustively with the respective\r\nsubjects should be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATS AND OILS.\r\n\r\nIt is very undesirable that any of these materials should be allowed to\r\nenter the soap pan without an analysis having first been made, as the\r\noil may not only have become partially hydrolysed, involving a loss of\r\nglycerine, or contain albuminous matter rendering the soap liable to\r\ndevelop rancidity, but actual sophistication may have taken place. Thus\r\na sample of tallow recently examined by the authors contained as much as\r\n40 per cent. of an unsaponifiable wax, which would have led to disaster\r\nin the soap pan, had the bulk been used without examination. After\r\nobserving the appearance, colour, and odour of the sample, noting any\r\ncharacteristic feature, the following physical and chemical data should\r\nbe determined.\r\n\r\n_Specific Gravity at 15 deg. C._ This may be taken by means of a Westphal\r\nbalance, or by using a picnometer of either the ordinary gravity bottle\r\nshape, with perforated stopper, or the Sprengel U-tube. The picnometer\r\nshould be calibrated with distilled water at 15 deg. C. The specific gravity\r\nof solid fats may be taken at an elevated temperature, preferably that\r\nof a boiling water bath.\r\n\r\n_Free acidity_ is estimated by weighing out from 2 to 5 grammes of the\r\nfat or oil, dissolving in neutral alcohol (purified methylated spirit)\r\nwith gentle heat, and titrating with a standard aqueous or alcoholic\r\nsolution of caustic soda or potash, using phenol-phthalein as indicator.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the flask are well shaken after each addition of alkali,\r\nand the reaction is complete when the slight excess of alkali causes a\r\npermanent pink coloration with the indicator. The standard alkali may be\r\nN/2, N/5, or N/10.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to calculate the result in terms of oleic acid (1 c.c. N/10\r\nalkali = 0.0282 gramme oleic acid), and express in percentage on the fat\r\nor oil.\r\n\r\n_Example._--1.8976 grammes were taken, and required 5.2 c.c. of N/10 KOH\r\nsolution for neutralisation.\r\n\r\n          5.2 x 0.0282 x 100\r\n          ------------------ = 7.72 per cent. free fatty acids,\r\n                1.8976                expressed as oleic acid.\r\n\r\nThe free acidity is sometimes expressed as _acid value_, which is the\r\namount of KOH in milligrammes necessary to neutralise the free acid in 1\r\ngramme of fat or oil.\r\n\r\nIn the above example:--\r\n\r\n          5.2 x 5.61\r\n          ---------- = 15.3 acid value.\r\n            1.8976\r\n\r\nThe _saponification equivalent_ is determined by weighing 2-4 grammes of\r\nfat or oil into a wide-necked flask (about 250 c.c. capacity), adding 30\r\nc.c. neutral alcohol, and warming under a reflux condenser on a steam or\r\nwater-bath. When boiling, the flask is disconnected, 50 c.c. of an\r\napproximately semi-normal alcoholic potash solution carefully added from\r\na burette, together with a few drops of phenol-phthalein solution, and\r\nthe boiling under a reflux condenser continued, with frequent agitation,\r\nuntil saponification is complete (usually from 30-60 minutes) which is\r\nindicated by the absence of fatty globules. The excess of alkali is\r\ntitrated with N/1 hydrochloric or sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe value of the approximately N/2 alkali solution is ascertained by\r\ntaking 50 c.c. together with 30 c.c. neutral alcohol in a similar flask,\r\nboiling for the same length of time as the fat, and titrating with N/1\r\nhydrochloric or sulphuric acid. The \"saponification equivalent\" is the\r\namount of fat or oil in grammes saponified by 1 equivalent or 56.1\r\ngrammes of caustic potash.\r\n\r\n_Example._--1.8976 grammes fat required 18.95 c.c. N/1 acid to\r\nneutralise the unabsorbed alkali.\r\n\r\nFifty c.c. approximately N/2 alcoholic potash solution required 25.6\r\nc.c. N/ acid..\r\n\r\n          25.6 - 18.95 = 6.65 c.c. N/1 KOH required by fat.\r\n\r\n          1.8976 x 1000 / 6.65 = 285.3 Saponification Equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe result of this test is often expressed as the \"Saponification\r\nValue,\" which is the number of milligrammes of KOH required for the\r\nsaponification of 1 gramme of fat. This may be found by dividing 56,100\r\nby the saponification equivalent or by multiplying the number of c.c. of\r\nN/1 alkali absorbed, by 56.1 and dividing by the quantity of fat taken.\r\nThus, in the above example:--\r\n\r\n          6.65 x 56.1 / 1.8976 = 196.6 Saponification Value.\r\n\r\nThe _ester_ or _ether value_, or number of milligrammes of KOH required\r\nfor the saponification of the neutral esters or glycerides in 1 gramme\r\nof fat, is represented by the difference between the saponification and\r\nacid values. In the example given, the ester value would be 196.6 - 15.3\r\n= 181.3.\r\n\r\n_Unsaponifiable Matter._--The usual method adopted is to saponify about\r\n5 grammes of the fat or oil with 50 c.c. of approximately N/2 alcoholic\r\npotash solution by boiling under a reflux condenser with frequent\r\nagitation for about 1 hour. The solution is then evaporated to dryness\r\nin a porcelain basin over a steam or water-bath, and the resultant soap\r\ndissolved in about 200 c.c. hot water. When sufficiently cool, the soap\r\nsolution is transferred to a separating funnel, 50 c.c. of ether added,\r\nthe whole well shaken, and allowed to rest. The ethereal layer is\r\nremoved to another separator, more ether being added to the aqueous soap\r\nsolution, and again separated. The two ethereal extracts are then washed\r\nwith water to deprive them of any soap, separated, transferred to a\r\nflask, and the ether distilled off upon a water-bath. The residue, dried\r\nin the oven at 100 deg. C. until constant, is the \"unsaponifiable matter,\"\r\nwhich is calculated to per cent. on the oil.\r\n\r\nIn this method, it is very frequently most difficult to obtain a\r\ndistinct separation of ether and aqueous soap solution--an intermediate\r\nlayer of emulsion remaining even after prolonged standing, and various\r\nexpedients have been recommended to overcome this, such as addition of\r\nalcohol (when petroleum ether is used), glycerine, more ether, water, or\r\ncaustic potash solution, or by rotatory agitation.\r\n\r\nA better plan is to proceed as in the method above described as far as\r\ndissolving the resulting soap in 200 c.c. water, and then boil for\r\ntwenty or thirty minutes. Slightly cool and acidify with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid (1 to 3), boil until the fatty acids are clear, wash with\r\nhot water free from mineral acid, and dry by filtering through a hot\r\nwater funnel.\r\n\r\nTwo grammes of the fatty acids are now dissolved in neutral alcohol\r\nsaturated with some solvent, preferably a light fraction of benzoline, a\r\nquantity of the solvent added to take up the unsaponifiable matter, and\r\nthe whole boiled under a reflux condenser. After cooling, the liquid is\r\ntitrated with N/2 aqueous KOH solution, using phenol-phthalein as\r\nindicator, this figure giving the amount of the total fatty acids\r\npresent. The whole is then poured into a separating funnel, when\r\nseparation immediately takes place. The alcoholic layer is withdrawn,\r\nthe benzoline washed with warm water (about 32 deg. C.) followed by neutral\r\nalcohol (previously saturated with the solvent), and transferred to a\r\ntared flask, which is attached to a condenser, and the benzoline\r\ndistilled off. The last traces of solvent remaining in the flask are\r\nremoved by gently warming in the water-oven, and the flask cooled and\r\nweighed, thus giving the amount of unsaponifiable matter.\r\n\r\n_Constitution of the Unsaponifiable Matter._--Unsaponifiable matter may\r\nconsist of cholesterol, phytosterol, solid alcohols (cetyl and ceryl\r\nalcohols), or hydrocarbons (mineral oil). Cholesterol is frequently\r\nfound in animal fats, and phytosterol is a very similar substance\r\npresent in vegetable fats. Solid alcohols occur naturally in sperm oil,\r\nbut hydrocarbons, which may be generally recognised by the fluorescence\r\nor bloom they give to the oil, are not natural constituents of animal or\r\nvegetable oils and fats.\r\n\r\nThe presence of cholesterol and phytosterol may be detected by\r\ndissolving a small portion of the unsaponifiable matter in acetic\r\nanhydride, and adding a drop of the solution to one drop of 50 per cent.\r\nsulphuric acid on a spot plate, when a characteristic blood red to\r\nviolet coloration is produced. It has been proposed to differentiate\r\nbetween cholesterol and phytosterol by their melting points, but it is\r\nmore reliable to compare the crystalline forms, the former crystallising\r\nin laminae, while the latter forms groups of needle-shaped tufts. Another\r\nmethod is to convert the substance into acetate, and take its melting\r\npoint, cholesterol acetate melting at 114.3-114.8 deg. C., and phytosterol\r\nacetate at 125.6 deg.-137 deg. C.\r\n\r\nAdditional tests for cholesterol have been recently proposed by\r\nLifschuetz (_Ber. Deut. Chem. Ges._, 1908, 252-255), and Golodetz (_Chem.\r\nZeit._, 1908, 160). In that due to the former, which depends on the\r\noxidation of cholesterol to oxycholesterol ester and oxycholesterol, a\r\nfew milligrammes of the substance are dissolved in 2-3 c.c. glacial\r\nacetic acid, a little benzoyl peroxide added, and the solution boiled,\r\nafter which four drops of strong sulphuric acid are added, when a\r\nviolet-blue or green colour is produced, if cholesterol is present, the\r\nviolet colour being due to oxycholesterol ester, the green to\r\noxycholesterol. Two tests are suggested by Golodetz (1) the addition of\r\none or two drops of a reagent consisting of five parts of concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid and three parts of formaldehyde solution, which colours\r\ncholesterol a blackish-brown, and (2) the addition of one drop of 30 per\r\ncent. formaldehyde solution to a solution of the substance in\r\ntrichloracetic acid, when with cholesterol an intense blue coloration is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n_Water._--From 5 to 20 grammes of the fat or oil are weighed into a\r\ntared porcelain or platinum dish, and stirred with a thermometer, whilst\r\nbeing heated over a gas flame at 100 deg. C. until bubbling or cracking has\r\nceased, and reweighed, the loss in weight representing the water. In\r\ncases of spurting a little added alcohol will carry the water off\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nTo prevent loss by spurting, Davis (_J. Amer. Chem. Soc._, 23, 487) has\r\nsuggested that the fat or oil should be added to a previously dried and\r\ntared coil of filter paper contained in a stoppered weighing bottle,\r\nwhich is then placed in the oven and dried at 100 deg. C. until constant in\r\nweight. Of course, this method is not applicable to oils or fats liable\r\nto oxidation on heating.\r\n\r\n_Dregs, Dirt, Adipose Tissue, Fibre, etc._--From 10 to 15 grammes of the\r\nfat are dissolved in petroleum ether with frequent stirring, and passed\r\nthrough a tared filter paper. The residue retained by the filter paper\r\nis washed with petroleum ether until free from fat, dried in the\r\nwater-oven at 100 deg. C. and weighed.\r\n\r\nIf the amount of residue is large, it may be ignited, and the proportion\r\nand nature of the ash determined.\r\n\r\nThe amount of impurities may also be estimated by Tate's method, which\r\nis performed by weighing 5 grammes of fat into a separating funnel,\r\ndissolving in ether, and allowing the whole to stand to enable the water\r\nto deposit. After six hours' rest the water is withdrawn, the tube of\r\nthe separator carefully dried, and the ethereal solution filtered\r\nthrough a dried tared filter paper into a tared flask. Well wash the\r\nfilter with ether, and carefully dry at 100 deg. C. The ether in the flask\r\nis recovered, and the flask dried until all ether is expelled, and its\r\nweight is constant. The amount of fat in the flask gives the quantity of\r\nactual fat in the sample taken; the loss represents the water and other\r\nimpurities, and these latter may be obtained from the increase of weight\r\nof the filter paper.\r\n\r\n_Starch_ may be detected by the blue coloration it gives with iodine\r\nsolution, and confirmed by microscopical examination, or it may be\r\nconverted into glucose by inversion, and the glucose estimated by means\r\nof Fehling's solution.\r\n\r\n_Iodine Absorption._--This determination shows the amount of iodine\r\nabsorbed by a fat or oil, and was devised by Huebl, the reagents required\r\nbeing as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Solution of 25 grammes iodine in 500 c.c. absolute alcohol; (2)\r\nsolution of 30 grammes mercuric chloride in 500 c.c. absolute alcohol,\r\nthese two solutions being mixed together and allowed to stand at least\r\ntwelve hours before use; (3) a freshly prepared 10 per cent. aqueous\r\nsolution of potassium iodide; and (4) a N/10 solution of sodium\r\nthiosulphate, standardised just prior to use by titrating a weighed\r\nquantity of resublimed iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution.\r\n\r\nIn the actual determination, 0.2 to 0.5 gramme of fat or fatty acids is\r\ncarefully weighed into a well-fitting stoppered 250 c.c. bottle,\r\ndissolved in 10 c.c. chloroform, and 25 c.c. of the Huebl reagent added,\r\nthe stopper being then moistened with potassium iodide solution and\r\nplaced firmly in the bottle, which is allowed to stand at rest in a dark\r\nplace for four hours. A blank experiment is also performed, using the\r\nsame quantities of chloroform and Huebl reagent, and allowing to stand\r\nfor the same length of time.\r\n\r\nAfter the expiration of four hours 20 c.c. of 10 per cent. solution of\r\npotassium iodide and 150 c.c. water are added to the contents of the\r\nbottle, and the excess of iodine titrated with N/10 sodium thiosulphate\r\nsolution, the whole being well agitated during the titration, which is\r\nfinished with starch paste as indicator. The blank experiment is\r\ntitrated in the same manner, and from the amount of thiosulphate\r\nrequired in the blank experiment is deducted the number of c.c. required\r\nby the unabsorbed iodine in the other bottle; this figure multiplied by\r\nthe iodine equivalent of 1 c.c. of the thiosulphate solution and by 100,\r\ndividing the product by the weight of fat taken, gives the \"Iodine\r\nNumber\".\r\n\r\n_Example._--1 c.c. of the N/10 sodium thiosulphate solution is found\r\nequal to 0.0126 gramme iodine.\r\n\r\n0.3187 gramme of fat taken. Blank requires 48.5 c.c. thiosulphate.\r\n\r\nBottle containing oil requires 40.0 c.c. thiosulphate.\r\n\r\n48.5 - 40.0 = 8.5, and the iodine absorption of the fat is--\r\n\r\n          8.5 x 0.0126 x 100\r\n          ------------------ = 33.6.\r\n                0.3187\r\n\r\nWijs showed that by the employment of a solution of iodine monochloride\r\nin glacial acetic acid reliable iodine figures are obtained in a much\r\nshorter time, thirty minutes being sufficient, and this method is now in\r\nmuch more general use than the Huebl. Wijs' iodine reagent is made by\r\ndissolving 13 grammes iodine in 1 litre of glacial acetic acid and\r\npassing chlorine into the solution until the iodine is all converted\r\ninto iodine monochloride. The process is carried out in exactly the same\r\nway as with the Huebl solution except that the fat is preferably\r\ndissolved in carbon tetrachloride instead of in chloroform.\r\n\r\n_Bromine absorption_ has now been almost entirely superseded by the\r\niodine absorption, although there are several good methods. The\r\ngravimetric method of Hehner (_Analyst_, 1895, 49) was employed by one\r\nof us for many years with very good results, whilst the bromine-thermal\r\ntest of Hehner and Mitchell (_Analyst_, 1895, 146) gives rapid and\r\nsatisfactory results. More recently MacIlhiney (_Jour. Amer. Chem.\r\nSoc._, 1899, 1084-1089) drew attention to bromine absorption methods and\r\ntried to rewaken interest in them.\r\n\r\nThe _Refractive index_ is sometimes useful for discriminating between\r\nvarious oils and fats, and, in conjunction with other physical and\r\nchemical data, affords another means of detecting adulteration.\r\n\r\nWhere a great number of samples have to be tested expeditiously, the\r\nAbbe refractometer or the Zeiss butyro-refractometer may be recommended\r\non account of the ease with which they are manipulated. The most usual\r\ntemperature of observations is 60 deg. C.\r\n\r\nThe _Titre_ or setting point of the fatty acids was devised by Dalican,\r\nand is generally accepted in the commercial valuation of solid fats as a\r\ngauge of firmness, and in the case of tallow has a considerable bearing\r\non the market value.\r\n\r\nOne ounce of the fat is melted in a shallow porcelain dish, and 30 c.c.\r\nof a 25 per cent. caustic soda solution added, together with 50 c.c. of\r\nredistilled methylated spirit. The whole is stirred down on the water\r\nbath until a pasty soap is obtained, when another 50 c.c. of methylated\r\nspirit is added, which redissolves the soap, and the whole again stirred\r\ndown to a solid soap. This is then dissolved in distilled water, a\r\nslight excess of dilute sulphuric acid added to liberate the fatty\r\nacids, and the whole warmed until the fatty acids form a clear liquid\r\non the surface. The water beneath the fatty acids is then syphoned off,\r\nmore distilled water added to wash out any trace of mineral acid\r\nremaining, and again syphoned off, this process being repeated until the\r\nwashings are no longer acid to litmus paper, when the fatty acids are\r\npoured on to a dry filter paper, which is inserted in a funnel resting\r\non a beaker, and the latter placed on the water-bath, where it is left\r\nuntil the clear fatty acids have filtered through.\r\n\r\nAbout 10-15 grammes of the pure fatty acids are now transferred to a\r\ntest tube, 6\" x 1\", warmed until molten, and the tube introduced through\r\na hole in the cork into a flask or wide-mouthed bottle. A very accurate\r\nthermometer, graduated into fifths of a degree Centigrade (previously\r\nstandardised), is immersed in the fatty acids, so that the bulb is as\r\nnear the centre as possible, and when the fatty acids just begin to\r\nsolidify at the bottom of the tube, the thermometer is stirred round\r\nslowly. The mercury will descend, and stirring is continued until it\r\nceases to fall further, at which point the thermometer is very carefully\r\nobserved. It will be found that the temperature will rise rapidly and\r\nfinally remain stationary for a short time, after which it will again\r\nbegin to drop until the temperature of the room is reached. The maximum\r\npoint to which the temperature rises is known as the \"titre\" of the\r\nsample.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALIES AND ALKALI SALTS.\r\n\r\nCare should be bestowed upon the sampling of solid caustic soda or\r\npotash as the impurities during the solidification always accumulate in\r\nthe centre of the drum, and an excess of that portion must be avoided or\r\nthe sample will not be sufficiently representative. The sampling should\r\nbe performed expeditiously to prevent carbonating, and portions placed\r\nin a stoppered bottle. The whole should be slightly broken in a mortar,\r\nand bright crystalline portions taken for analysis, using a stoppered\r\nweighing bottle.\r\n\r\n_Caustic Soda and Caustic Potash._--These substances are valued\r\naccording to the alkali present in the form of caustic (hydrate) and\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 grammes of the sample are dissolved in 50 c.c. distilled water,\r\nand titrated with N/1 sulphuric acid, using phenol-phthalein as\r\nindicator, the alkalinity so obtained representing all the caustic\r\nalkali and one-half the carbonate, which latter is converted into\r\nbicarbonate. One c.c. N/1 acid = 0.031 gramme Na_{2}O or 0.040 gramme\r\nNaOH and 0.047 gramme K_{2}O, or 0.056 gramme KOH.\r\n\r\nAfter this first titration, the second half of the carbonate may be\r\ndetermined in one of two ways, either:--\r\n\r\n(1) By adding from 3-5 c.c. of N/10 acid, and well boiling for five\r\nminutes to expel carbonic-acid gas, after which the excess of acid is\r\ntitrated with N/10 soda solution; or\r\n\r\n(2) After adding two drops of methyl orange solution, N/10 acid is run\r\nin until the solution acquires a faint pink tint.\r\n\r\nIn the calculation of the caustic alkali, the number of c.c. of acid\r\nrequired in the second titration, divided by 10, is subtracted from that\r\nused in the first, and this difference multiplied by 0.031, or 0.047\r\ngives the amount of Na_{2}O or K_{2}O respectively in the weight of\r\nsample taken, whence the percentage may be readily calculated.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of carbonate is calculated by multiplying the amount of\r\nN/10 acid required in the second titration by 2, and then by either\r\n0.0031 or 0.0047 to give the amount of carbonate present, expressed as\r\nNa_{2}O or K_{2}O respectively.\r\n\r\nAn alternative method is to determine the alkalinity before and after\r\nthe elimination of carbonate by chloride of barium.\r\n\r\nAbout 7-8 grammes of the sample are dissolved in water, and made up to\r\n100 c.c., and the total alkalinity determined by titrating 20 c.c. with\r\nN/1 acid, using methyl orange as indicator. To another 20 c.c. is added\r\nbarium chloride solution (10 per cent.) until it ceases to give a\r\nprecipitate, the precipitate allowed to settle, and the clear\r\nsupernatant liquid decanted off, the precipitate transferred to a filter\r\npaper and well washed, and the filtrate titrated with N/1 acid, using\r\nphenol-phthalein as indicator. The second titration gives the amount of\r\ncaustic alkali present, and the difference between the two the\r\nproportion of carbonate.\r\n\r\nWhen methyl orange solution is used as indicator, titrations must be\r\ncarried out cold.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made (p. 39) to the manner in which the\r\nalkali percentage is expressed in English degrees in the case of caustic\r\nsoda.\r\n\r\n_Chlorides_ are estimated by titrating the neutral solution with N/10\r\nsilver nitrate solution, potassium chromate being used as indicator. One\r\nc.c. N/10 AgNO_{3} solution = 0.00585 gramme sodium chloride.\r\n\r\nThe amount of acid necessary for exact neutralisation having already\r\nbeen ascertained, it is recommended to use the equivalent quantity of\r\nN/10 nitric acid to produce the neutral solution.\r\n\r\n_Sulphides_ may be tested for, qualitatively, with lead acetate\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n_Aluminates_ are determined gravimetrically in the usual manner; 2\r\ngrammes are dissolved in water, rendered acid with HCl, excess of\r\nammonia added, and the gelatinous precipitate of aluminium hydrate\r\ncollected on a filter paper, washed, burnt, and weighed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Carbonated Alkali (Soda Ash)._--The total or available alkali is, of\r\ncourse, the chief factor to be ascertained, and for this purpose it is\r\nconvenient to weigh out 3.1 grammes of the sample, dissolve in 50 c.c.\r\nwater, and titrate with N/1 sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, using methyl\r\norange as indicator. Each c.c. of N/1 acid required represents 1 per\r\ncent. Na_{2}O in the sample under examination.\r\n\r\nA more complete analysis of soda ash would comprise:--\r\n\r\n_Insoluble matter_, remaining after 10 grammes are dissolved in warm\r\nwater. This is washed on to a filter-paper, dried, ignited, and weighed.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate is made up to 200 c.c., and in it may be determined:--\r\n\r\n_Caustic soda_, by titrating with N/1 acid the filtrate resulting from\r\nthe treatment of 20 c.c. (equal to 1 gramme) with barium chloride\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate._--Titrate 20 c.c. with N/1 acid, and deduct the amount of\r\nacid required for the Caustic.\r\n\r\n_Chlorides._--Twenty c.c. are exactly neutralised with nitric acid,\r\ntitrated with N/10 AgNO_{3} solution, using potassium chromate as\r\nindicator.\r\n\r\n_Sulphates._--Twenty c.c. are acidulated with HCl, and the sulphates\r\nprecipitated with barium chloride; the precipitate is collected on a\r\nfilter paper, washed, dried, ignited, and weighed, the result being\r\ncalculated to Na_{2}SO_{4}.\r\n\r\n_Sulphides and Sulphites._--The presence of these compounds is denoted\r\nby the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphurous acid\r\nrespectively when the sample is acidulated. Sulphides may also be tested\r\nfor, qualitatively, with lead acetate solution, or test-paper of sodium\r\nnitro-prusside.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of these compounds may be ascertained by acidulating\r\nwith acetic acid, and titrating with N/10 iodine solution, using starch\r\npaste as indicator. One c.c. N/10 iodine solution = 0.0063 gramme\r\nNa_{2}SO_{3}.\r\n\r\nThe amount of sulphides may be estimated by titrating the hot soda\r\nsolution, to which ammonia has been added, with an ammoniacal silver\r\nnitrate solution, 1 c.c. of which corresponds to 0.005 gramme Na_{2}S.\r\nAs the titration proceeds, the precipitate is filtered off, and the\r\naddition of ammoniacal silver solution to the filtrate continued until a\r\ndrop produces only a slight opacity. The presence of chloride, sulphate,\r\nhydrate, or carbonate does not interfere with the accuracy of this\r\nmethod. The ammoniacal silver nitrate solution is prepared by dissolving\r\n13.345 grammes of pure silver in pure nitric acid, adding 250 c.c.\r\nliquor ammoniae fortis, and diluting to 1 litre.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of Potash (Pearl Ash)._--The total or available alkali may be\r\nestimated by taking 6.9 grammes of the sample, and titrating with N/1\r\nacid directly, or adding 100 c.c. N/1 sulphuric acid, boiling for a few\r\nminutes, and titrating the excess of acid with N/1 caustic soda\r\nsolution, using litmus as indicator. In this case each c.c. N/1 acid\r\nrequired, is equivalent, in the absence of Na_{2}CO_{3}, to 1 per cent.\r\nK_{2}CO_{3}.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of potash may be further examined for the following:--\r\n\r\n_Moisture._--From 2-3 grammes are heated for thirty minutes in a\r\ncrucible over a gas flame, and weighed when cold, the loss in weight\r\nrepresenting the moisture.\r\n\r\n_Insoluble residue_, remaining after solution in water, filtering and\r\nwell washing.\r\n\r\n_Potassium_ may be determined by precipitation as potassium\r\nplatino-chloride thus:--Dissolve 0.5 gramme in a small quantity (say 10\r\nc.c.) of water, and carefully acidulate with hydrochloric acid,\r\nevaporate the resultant liquor to dryness in a tared platinum basin, and\r\nheat the residue gradually to dull redness. Cool in a desicator, weigh,\r\nand express the result as \"mixed chlorides,\" _i.e._ chlorides of soda\r\nand potash. To the mixed chlorides add 10 c.c. water, and platinic\r\nchloride in excess (the quantity may be three times the amount of the\r\nmixed chlorides) and evaporate nearly to dryness; add 15 c.c. alcohol\r\nand allow to stand three hours covered with a watch-glass, giving the\r\ndish a gentle rotatory movement occasionally. The clear liquid is\r\ndecanted through a tared filter, and the precipitate well washed with\r\nalcohol by decantation, and finally transferred to the filter, dried and\r\nweighed. From the weight of potassium platino-chloride, K_{2}PtCl_{6},\r\nis calculated the amount of potassium oxide K_{2}O by the use of the\r\nfactor 94/488.2 or 0.19254.\r\n\r\n_Chlorides_, determined with N/10 silver nitrate solution, and\r\ncalculated to KCl.\r\n\r\n_Sulphates_, estimated as barium sulphate, and calculated to\r\nK_{2}SO_{4}.\r\n\r\n_Sodium Carbonate_, found by deducting the K_{2}CO_{3} corresponding to\r\nthe actual potassium as determined above, from the total alkali.\r\n\r\n_Iron_, precipitated with excess of ammonia, filtered, ignited, and\r\nweighed as Fe_{2}O_{3}.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODIUM CHLORIDE (COMMON SALT).\r\n\r\nThis should be examined for the following:--\r\n\r\n_Actual Chloride_, either titrated with N/10 silver nitrate solution,\r\nusing neutral potassium chromate solution as indicator, or, preferably,\r\nestimated gravimetrically as silver chloride by precipitation with\r\nsilver nitrate solution, the precipitate transferred to a tared filter\r\npaper, washed, dried and weighed.\r\n\r\n_Insoluble matter_, remaining on dissolving 5 grammes in water, and\r\nfiltering. This is washed, dried, ignited and weighed.\r\n\r\n_Moisture._--5 grammes are weighed into a platinum crucible, and heat\r\ngently applied. The temperature is gradually increased to a dull red\r\nheat, which is maintained for a few minutes, the dish cooled in a\r\ndesicator, and weighed.\r\n\r\n_Sulphates_ are estimated by precipitation as barium sulphate and\r\ncalculated to Na_{2}SO_{4}.\r\n\r\n_Sodium._--This may be determined by converting the salt into sodium\r\nsulphate by the action of concentrated sulphuric acid, igniting to drive\r\noff hydrochloric and sulphuric acids, and fusing the mass until constant\r\nin weight, weighing finally as Na_{2}SO_{4}.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM CHLORIDE.\r\n\r\nThis should be examined, in the same way as sodium chloride, for\r\nchloride, insoluble matter, moisture, and sulphate. The potassium may be\r\ndetermined as potassium platino-chloride, as described under carbonate\r\nof potash.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICATES OF SODA AND POTASH.\r\n\r\nThe most important determinations for these are total alkali and silica.\r\n\r\n_Total alkali_ is estimated by dissolving 2 grammes in distilled water,\r\nand titrating when cold, with N/1 acid, using methyl orange as\r\nindicator.\r\n\r\n_Silica_ may be determined by dissolving 1 gramme in distilled water,\r\nrendering the solution acid with HCl, and evaporating to complete\r\ndryness on the water-bath, after which the residue is moistened with HCl\r\nand again evaporated, this operation being repeated a third time. The\r\nresidue is then heated to about 150 deg. C., extracted with hot dilute HCl,\r\nfiltered, thoroughly washed, dried, ignited in a tared platinum\r\ncrucible, and weighed as SiO_{2}.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL OILS.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, these are very liable to adulteration, and an\r\nexamination of all kinds of oil is desirable, while in the case of the\r\nmore expensive varieties it should never be omitted.\r\n\r\n_Specific Gravity._--As with fats and oils, this is usually taken at 15 deg.\r\nC., and compared with water at the same temperature. In the case of otto\r\nof rose and guaiac wood oil, however, which are solid at this\r\ntemperature, it is generally observed at 30 deg. C. compared with water at\r\n15 deg. C.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity is preferably taken in a bottle or U-tube, but if\r\nsufficient of the oil is available and a high degree of accuracy is not\r\nnecessary, it may be taken either with a Westphal balance, or by means\r\nof a hydrometer.\r\n\r\n_Optical Rotation._--For this purpose a special instrument, known as a\r\npolarimeter, is required, details of the construction and use of which\r\nwould be out of place here. Suffice it to mention that temperature plays\r\nan important part in the determination of the optical activity of\r\ncertain essential oils, notably in the case of lemon and orange oils.\r\nFor these Gildemeister and Hoffmann give the following corrections:--\r\n\r\nLemon oil, below 20 deg. C. subtract 9' for each degree below, above 20 deg. C.\r\nadd 8' for each degree above.\r\n\r\nOrange oil, below 20 deg. C. subtract 14' for each degree below, above 20 deg.\r\nC. add 13' for each degree above.\r\n\r\n_Refractive Index._--This figure is occasionally useful, and is best\r\ndetermined with an Abbe refractometer, at 20 deg. C.\r\n\r\n_Solubility in Alcohol._--This is found by running alcohol of the\r\nrequisite strength from a burette into a measured volume of the oil with\r\nconstant agitation, until the oil forms a clear solution with the\r\nalcohol. Having noted the quantity of alcohol added, it is well to run\r\nin a small further quantity of alcohol, and observe whether any\r\nopalescence or cloudiness appears.\r\n\r\n_Acid_, _ester_, and _saponification values_ are determined exactly as\r\ndescribed under fats and oils. Instead of expressing the result as\r\nsaponification value or number, the percentage of ester, calculated in\r\nthe form of the most important ester present, may be obtained by\r\nmultiplying the number of c.c. of N/1 alkali absorbed in the\r\nsaponification by the molecular weight of the ester. Thus, to find the\r\npercentage as linalyl acetate, the number of c.c. absorbed would be\r\nmultiplied by 0.196 and by 100, and divided by the weight of oil taken.\r\n\r\n_Alcohols._--For the estimation of these, if the oil contains much ester\r\nit must first be saponified with alcoholic potash, to liberate the\r\ncombined alcohols, and after neutralising the excess of alkali with\r\nacid, the oil is washed into a separating funnel with water, separated,\r\ndried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, and is then ready for the alcohol\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nIf there is only a small quantity of ester present, this preliminary\r\nsaponification is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe alcohols are estimated by conversion into their acetic esters, which\r\nare then saponified with standard alcoholic potash, thereby furnishing a\r\nmeasure of the amount of alcohol esterified.\r\n\r\nTen c.c. of the oil is placed in a flask with an equal volume of acetic\r\nanhydride, and 2 grammes of anhydrous sodium acetate, and gently boiled\r\nfor an hour to an hour and a half. After cooling, water is added, and\r\nthe contents of the flask heated on the water-bath for fifteen to thirty\r\nminutes, after which they are cooled, transferred to a separating\r\nfunnel, and washed with a brine solution until the washings cease to\r\ngive an acid reaction with litmus paper. The oil is now dried with\r\nanhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered, and 1-2 grammes weighed into a\r\nflask and saponified with alcoholic potash as in the determination of\r\nester or saponification value.\r\n\r\nThe calculation is a little complicated, but an example may perhaps\r\nserve to make it clear.\r\n\r\nA geranium oil containing 26.9 per cent. of ester, calculated as geranyl\r\ntiglate, was acetylated, after saponification, to liberate the combined\r\ngeraniol, and 2.3825 grammes of the acetylated oil required 9.1 c.c. of\r\nN/1 alkali for its saponification.\r\n\r\nNow every 196 grammes of geranyl acetate present in the acetylated oil\r\ncorrespond to 154 grammes of geraniol, so that for every 196 grammes of\r\nester now present in the oil, 42 grammes have been added to its weight,\r\nand it is therefore necessary to make a deduction from the weight of oil\r\ntaken for the final saponification to allow for this, and since each\r\nc.c. of N/1 alkali absorbed corresponds to 0.196 gramme of geranyl\r\nacetate, the amount to be deducted is found by multiplying the number of\r\nc.c. absorbed by 0.042 gramme, the formula for the estimation of total\r\nalcohols thus becoming in the example given:--\r\n\r\n                                    9.1 x 0.154 x 100\r\n          Per cent. of geraniol = ---------------------- = 70.2\r\n                                  2.3825 - (9.1 x 0.042)\r\n\r\nThe percentage of combined alcohols can be calculated from the amount of\r\nester found, and by subtracting this from the percentage of total\r\nalcohols, that of the free alcohols is obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the example quoted, the ester corresponds to 17.6 per cent. geraniol,\r\nand this, deducted from the total alcohols, gives 52.6 per cent. free\r\nalcohols, calculated as geraniol.\r\n\r\nThis process gives accurate results with geraniol, borneol, and menthol,\r\nbut with linalol and terpineol the figures obtained are only\r\ncomparative, a considerable quantity of these alcohols being decomposed\r\nduring the acetylation. The aldehyde citronellal is converted by acetic\r\nanhydride into isopulegol acetate, so that this is also included in the\r\ndetermination of graniol in citronella oil.\r\n\r\n_Phenols._--These bodies are soluble in alkalies, and may be estimated\r\nby measuring 5 c.c. or 10 c.c. of the oil into a Hirschsohn flask (a\r\nflask of about 100 c.c. capacity with a long narrow neck holding 10\r\nc.c., graduated in tenths of a c.c.), adding 25 c.c. of a 5 per cent.\r\naqueous caustic potash solution, and warming in the water-bath, then\r\nadding another 25 c.c., and after one hour in the water-bath filling the\r\nflask with the potash solution until the unabsorbed oil rises into the\r\nneck of the flask, the volume of this oil being read off when it has\r\ncooled down to the temperature of the laboratory. From the volume of oil\r\ndissolved the percentage of phenols is readily calculated.\r\n\r\n_Aldehydes._--In the estimation of these substances, use is made of\r\ntheir property of combining with sodium bisulphite to form compounds\r\nsoluble in hot water. From 5-10 c.c. of the oil is measured into a\r\nHirschsohn flask, about 30 c.c. of a hot saturated solution of sodium\r\nbisulphite added, and the flask immersed in a boiling water bath, and\r\nthoroughly shaken at frequent intervals. Further quantities of the\r\nbisulphite solution are gradually added, until, after about one hour,\r\nthe unabsorbed oil rises into the neck of the flask, where, after\r\ncooling, its volume is read off, and the percentage of absorbed oil, or\r\naldehydes, calculated.\r\n\r\nIn the case of lemon oil, where the proportion of aldehydes, though of\r\ngreat importance, is relatively very small, it is necessary to first\r\nconcentrate the aldehydes before determining them. For this purpose, 100\r\nc.c. of the oil is placed in a Ladenburg fractional distillation flask,\r\nand 90 c.c. distilled off under a pressure of not more than 40 mm., and\r\nthe residue steam distilled. The oil so obtained is separated from the\r\ncondensed water, measured, dried, and 5 c.c. assayed for aldehydes\r\neither by the process already described, or by the following process\r\ndevised by Burgess (_Analyst_, 1904, 78):--\r\n\r\nFive c.c. of the oil are placed in the Hirschsohn flask, about 20 c.c.\r\nof a saturated solution of neutral sodium sulphite added, together with\r\na few drops of rosolic acid solution as indicator, and the flask placed\r\nin a boiling water-bath and continually agitated. The contents of the\r\nflask soon become red owing to the liberation of free alkali by the\r\ncombination of the aldehyde with part of the sodium sulphite, and this\r\ncoloration is just discharged by the addition of sufficient 10 per\r\ncent. acetic-acid solution. The flask is again placed in the water-bath,\r\nthe shaking continued, and any further alkali liberated neutralised by\r\nmore acetic acid, the process being continued in this way until no\r\nfurther red colour is produced. The flask is then filled with the sodium\r\nsulphite solution, the volume of the cooled unabsorbed oil read off, and\r\nthe percentage of aldehydes calculated as before.\r\n\r\n_Solidifying Point, or Congealing Point._--This is of some importance in\r\nthe examination of anise and fennel oils, and is also useful in the\r\nexamination of otto of rose. A suitable apparatus may be made by\r\nobtaining three test tubes, of different sizes, which will fit one\r\ninside the other, and fixing them together in this way through corks.\r\nThe innermost tube is then filled with the oil, and a sensitive\r\nthermometer, similar to that described under the Titre test for fats,\r\nsuspended with its bulb completely immersed in the oil. With anise and\r\nfennel, the oil is cooled down with constant stirring until it just\r\nstarts crystallising, when the stirring is interrupted, and the maximum\r\ntemperature to which the mercury rises noted. This is the solidifying\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIn the case of otto of rose, the otto is continually stirred, and the\r\npoint at which the first crystal is observed is usually regarded as the\r\ncongealing point.\r\n\r\n_Melting Point._--This is best determined by melting some of the solid\r\noil, or crystals, and sucking a small quantity up into a capillary tube,\r\nwhich is then attached by a rubber band to the bulb of the thermometer,\r\nimmersed in a suitable bath (water, glycerine, oil, etc.) and the\r\ntemperature of the bath gradually raised until the substance in the tube\r\nis sufficiently melted to rise to the surface, the temperature at which\r\nthis takes place being the melting point.\r\n\r\nThe melting point of otto of rose is usually taken in a similar tube to\r\nthe setting point, and is considered to be the point at which the last\r\ncrystal disappears.\r\n\r\n_Iodine Absorption._--In the authors' opinion, this is of some value in\r\nconjunction with other data in judging of the purity of otto of rose. It\r\nis determined by Huebl's process as described under Fats and Oils, except\r\nthat only 0.1 to 0.2 gramme is taken, and instead of 10 c.c. of\r\nchloroform, 10 c.c. of pure alcohol are added. The rest of the process\r\nis identical.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAP.\r\n\r\nIn the analysis of soap, it is a matter of considerable importance that\r\nall the determinations should be made on a uniform and average sample of\r\nthe soap, otherwise very misleading and unreliable figures are obtained.\r\nSoap very rapidly loses its moisture on the surface, while the interior\r\nof the bar or cake may be comparatively moist, and the best way is to\r\ncarefully remove the outer edges and take the portions for analysis from\r\nthe centre. In the case of a household or unmilled toilet soap, it is\r\nimperative that the quantities for analysis should all be weighed out as\r\nquickly after each other as possible.\r\n\r\n_Fatty Acids._--Five grammes of the soap are rapidly weighed into a\r\nsmall beaker, distilled water added, and the beaker heated on the water\r\nbath until the soap is dissolved.\r\n\r\nA slight excess of mineral acid is now added, and the whole heated until\r\nthe separated fatty acids are perfectly clear, when they are collected\r\non a tared filter paper, well washed with hot water and dried until\r\nconstant in weight. The result multiplied by 20 gives the percentage of\r\nfatty acids in the sample.\r\n\r\nA quicker method, and one which gives accurate results when care is\r\nbestowed upon it, is to proceed in the manner described above as far as\r\nthe decomposition with mineral acid, and to then add 5 or 10 grammes of\r\nstearic acid or beeswax to the contents of the beaker and heat until a\r\nclear layer of fatty matter collects upon the acid liquor.\r\n\r\nCool the beaker, and when the cake is sufficiently hard, remove it\r\ncarefully by means of a spatula and dry on a filtering paper, add the\r\nportions adhering to the sides of the beaker to the cake, and weigh.\r\n\r\nThe weight, less the amount of stearic acid or beeswax added, multiplied\r\nby 20 gives the percentage of fatty acids.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the cake does not contain enclosed water.\r\n\r\nThe results of these methods are returned as fatty acids, but are in\r\nreality insoluble fatty acids, the soluble fatty acids being generally\r\ndisregarded. However in soaps made from cocoa-nut and palm-kernel oils\r\n(which contain an appreciable quantity of soluble fatty acids) the acid\r\nliquor is shaken with ether, and, after evaporation of the ethereal\r\nextract, the amount of fatty matter left is added to the result already\r\nobtained as above, or the ether method described below may be\r\nadvantageously employed.\r\n\r\nWhere the soap under examination contains mineral matter, the separated\r\nfatty acids may be dissolved in ether. This is best performed in an\r\nelongated, graduated, stoppered tube, the total volume of the ether,\r\nafter subsidence, carefully read, and an aliquot part taken and\r\nevaporated to dryness in a tared flask, which is placed in the oven at\r\n100 deg. C. until the weight is constant.\r\n\r\nIn a complete analysis, the figure for fatty acids should be converted\r\ninto terms of fatty anhydrides by multiplying by the factor 0.9875.\r\n\r\nIn this test the resin acids contained in the soap are returned as fatty\r\nacids, but the former can be estimated, as described later, and deducted\r\nfrom the total.\r\n\r\n_Total Alkali._--The best method is to incinerate 5 grammes of the soap\r\nin a platinum dish, dissolve the residue in water, boil and filter,\r\nmaking the volume of filtrate up to 250 c.c., the solution being\r\nreserved for the subsequent determination of salt, silicates, and\r\nsulphates, as detailed below.\r\n\r\nFifty c.c. of the solution are titrated with N/1 acid, to methyl orange,\r\nand the result expressed in terms of Na_{2}O.\r\n\r\nNumber of c.c. required x 0.031 x 100 = per cent. Na_{2}O.\r\n\r\nThe total alkali may also be estimated in the filtrate from the\r\ndetermination of fatty acids, if the acid used for decomposing the soap\r\nsolution has been measured and its strength known, by titrating back the\r\nexcess of acid with normal soda solution, when the difference will equal\r\nthe amount of total alkali in the quantity taken.\r\n\r\nThe total alkali is usually expressed in the case of hard soaps as\r\nNa_{2}O, and in soft soaps as K_{2}O.\r\n\r\n_Free caustic alkali_ is estimated by dissolving 2 grammes of the soap,\r\nin neutral pure alcohol, with gentle heat, filtering, well washing the\r\nfilter with hot neutral spirit, and titrating the filtrate with N/10\r\nacid, to phenol-phthalein.\r\n\r\nNumber of c.c. required x 0.0031 x 50 = per cent. free alkali Na_{2}O,\r\nas caustic.\r\n\r\n_Free Carbonated Alkali._--The residue on the filter paper from the\r\nabove determination is washed with hot water, and the aqueous filtrate\r\ntitrated with N/10 acid, using methyl orange as indicator. The result is\r\ngenerally expressed in terms of Na_{2}O.\r\n\r\nNumber of c.c. required x 0.0031 x 50 = per cent. free alkali Na_{2}O,\r\nas carbonate.\r\n\r\n_Free Alkali._--Some analysts determine the alkalinity to\r\nphenol-phthalein of the alcoholic soap solution without filtering, and\r\nexpress it as free alkali (caustic, carbonates, or any salt having an\r\nalkaline reaction).\r\n\r\n_Combined Alkali._--The difference between total alkali and free alkali\r\n(caustic and carbonate together) represents the alkali combined with\r\nfatty acids. This figure may also be directly determined by titrating,\r\nwith N/2 acid, the alcoholic solution of soap after the free caustic\r\nestimation, using lacmoid as indicator.\r\n\r\nThe potash and soda in soaps may be separated by the method described\r\nfor the estimation of potassium in _Pearl ash_ (page 126).\r\n\r\nThe potassium platino-chloride (K_{2}PtCl_{6}) is calculated to\r\npotassium chloride (KCl) by using the factor 0.3052, and this figure\r\ndeducted from the amount of mixed chlorides found, gives the amount of\r\nsodium chloride (NaCl), from which the sodium oxide (Na_{2}O) is\r\nobtained by multiplying by 0.52991.\r\n\r\nThe potassium chloride (KCl) is converted into terms of potassium oxide\r\n(K_{2}O) by the use of the factor 0.63087.\r\n\r\n_Salt_ may be determined in 50 c.c. of the filtered aqueous extract of\r\nthe incinerated soap, by exactly neutralising with normal acid and\r\ntitrating with N/10 silver nitrate solution, using a neutral solution of\r\npotassium chromate as indicator. The final reaction is more distinctly\r\nobserved if a little bicarbonate of soda is added to the solution.\r\n\r\nNumber of c.c. required x 0.00585 x 100 = per cent. of common salt,\r\nNaCl.\r\n\r\nChlorides may also be estimated by Volhard's method, the aqueous extract\r\nbeing rendered slightly acid with nitric acid, a measured volume of N/10\r\nsilver nitrate solution added, and the excess titrated back with N/10\r\nammonium thiocyanate solution, using iron alum as indicator.\r\n\r\n_Silicates._--These are estimated by evaporating 50 c.c. of the filtered\r\nextract from the incinerated soap, in a platinum dish with hydrochloric\r\nacid twice to complete dryness, heating to 150 deg. C., adding hot water,\r\nand filtering through a tared filter paper.\r\n\r\nThe residue is well washed, ignited, and weighed as SiO_{2}, and from\r\nthis silica is calculated the sodium silicate.\r\n\r\n_Sulphates_ may be determined in the filtrate from the silica estimation\r\nby precipitation with barium chloride solution, and weighing the barium\r\nsulphate, after filtering, and burning, expressing the result in terms\r\nof Na_{2}SO_{4} by the use of the factor 0.6094.\r\n\r\n_Moisture._--This is simply estimated by taking a weighed portion in\r\nsmall shavings in a tared dish, and drying in the oven at 105 deg. C. until\r\nit ceases to lose weight. From the loss thus found is calculated the\r\nmoisture percentage.\r\n\r\n_Free or Uncombined Fat._--This is usually determined by repeated\r\nextraction of an aqueous solution of the soap with petroleum ether; the\r\nethereal solution, after washing with water to remove traces of soap, is\r\nevaporated to dryness and the residue weighed.\r\n\r\nA good method, which can be recommended for employment where many\r\ndeterminations have to be performed, is to dissolve 10 grammes of soap\r\nin 50 c.c. neutral alcohol and titrate to phenol-phthalein with N/1\r\nacid. Add 3-5 drops HCl and boil to expel carbonic acid, neutralise with\r\nalcoholic KOH solution and add exactly 10 c.c. in excess, boil for\r\nfifteen minutes under a reflux condenser and titrate with N/1 acid. The\r\ndifference between this latter figure and the amount required for a\r\nblank test with 10 c.c. alcoholic KOH, denotes the amount of alkali\r\nabsorbed by the uncombined fat.\r\n\r\n_Examination of the fatty acids_ as a guide to the probable composition\r\nof the soap:--\r\n\r\nFrom the data obtained by estimating the \"titre,\" iodine number, and\r\nsaponification equivalent of the mixed fatty and rosin acids, and the\r\nrosin content, a fairly good idea of the constitution of the soap may be\r\ndeduced.\r\n\r\nThe titre, iodine number, and saponification equivalent are determined\r\nin exactly the same manner as described under Fats and Oils.\r\n\r\nThe presence of rosin may be detected by the Liebermann-Storch reaction,\r\nwhich consists in dissolving a small quantity of the fatty acids in\r\nacetic anhydride, and adding to a few drops of this solution 1 drop of\r\n50 per cent. sulphuric acid. A violet coloration is produced with rosin\r\nacids. The amount of rosin may be estimated by the method devised by\r\nTwitchell (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1891, 804) which is carried out\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\nTwo grammes of the mixed fatty and rosin acids are dissolved in 20 c.c.\r\nabsolute alcohol, and dry hydrochloric acid gas passed through until no\r\nmore is absorbed, the flask being kept cool by means of cold water to\r\nprevent the rosin acids being acted upon. The flask, after\r\ndisconnecting, is allowed to stand one hour to ensure complete\r\ncombination, when its contents are transferred to a Philips' beaker,\r\nwell washed out with water so that the volume is increased about five\r\ntimes, and boiled until the acid solution is clear, a fragment of\r\ngranulated zinc being added to prevent bumping. The heat is removed, and\r\nthe liquid allowed to cool, when it is poured into a separator, and the\r\nbeaker thoroughly rinsed out with ether. After shaking, the acid liquor\r\nis withdrawn, and the ethereal layer washed with water until free from\r\nacid. Fifty c.c. neutral alcohol are added, and the solution titrated\r\nwith N/1 KOH or NaOH solution, the percentage of rosin being calculated\r\nfrom its combining weight. Twitchell suggests 346 as the combining\r\nweight of rosin, but 330 is a closer approximation.\r\n\r\nThe method may be also carried out gravimetrically, in which case\r\npetroleum ether, boiling at 74 deg. C. is used for washing out the beaker\r\ninto the separator. The acid liquor is run off, and the petroleum ether\r\nlayer washed first with water and then with a solution of 1/2 gramme KOH\r\nand 5 c.c. alcohol in 50 c.c. water, and agitated. The rosin is thus\r\nsaponified and separated. The resinate solution is withdrawn, acidified,\r\nand the resin acids collected, dried and weighed.\r\n\r\n_Halphen's Reaction._--This is a special test to determine the presence\r\nor absence of cotton-seed oil fatty acids in mixtures. Equal parts of\r\nthe fatty acids, amyl alcohol, and a 1 per cent. solution of sulphur in\r\ncarbon bisulphide, are heated in a test-tube placed in a water-bath\r\nuntil effervescence ceases, then in boiling brine for one hour or longer\r\nwhen only small quantities are present. The presence of cotton-seed oil\r\nis denoted by a pink coloration. The reaction is rendered much more\r\nrapid, according to Rupp (_Z. Untersuch. Nahr. Genussm._, 1907, 13, 74),\r\nby heating in a stoppered flask.\r\n\r\nOther bodies which it is occasionally necessary to test for or determine\r\nin soap include:--\r\n\r\n_Carbolic acid._--Fifty grammes of the soap are dissolved in water and\r\n20 c.c. of 10 per cent. caustic potash added. The solution is treated\r\nwith an excess of brine, the supernatant liquor separated, and the\r\nprecipitate washed with brine, the washings being added to the liquor\r\nwithdrawn. This is then evaporated to a small bulk, placed in a Muter's\r\ngraduated tube, and acidified with mineral acid.\r\n\r\nThe volume of separated phenols is observed and stated in percentage on\r\nthe soap taken.\r\n\r\nOr the alkaline layer may be rendered acid and steam distilled; the\r\ndistillate is made up to a known volume, and a portion titrated by the\r\nKoppeschaar method with standard bromine water.\r\n\r\n_Glycerine._--Five grammes of soap are dissolved in water, decomposed\r\nwith dilute sulphuric acid, and the clear fatty acids filtered and\r\nwashed. The filtrate is neutralised with barium carbonate, evaporated\r\nto 50 c.c., and the glycerol estimated by the bichromate method detailed\r\nunder Crude Glycerine.\r\n\r\n_Starch_ or _gum_ may be detected by dissolving the soap in alcohol,\r\nfiltering, and examining the residue on the filter paper. Starch is\r\nreadily recognised by the blue coloration it gives with a solution of\r\niodine in potassium iodide.\r\n\r\n_Sugars_ are tested for by means of Fehlings' solution, in the liquor\r\nseparated from the fatty acids, after first boiling with dilute acid to\r\ninvert any cane sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mercury_ will be revealed by a black precipitate produced when\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen is added to the liquor separated from the fatty\r\nacids, and may be estimated by filtering off this precipitate on a tared\r\nGooch's crucible, which is then dried and weighed.\r\n\r\n_Borax or borates_ are tested for in the residue insoluble in alcohol.\r\nThis is dissolved in water, rendered faintly acid with dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, and a strip of turmeric paper immersed for a few\r\nminutes in the liquid. This is then dried in the water-oven, when if any\r\nboric acid compound is present, a bright reddish-pink stain is produced\r\non the paper, which is turned blue on moistening with dilute alkali.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the boric acid radicle may be determined by incinerating\r\n5-10 grammes of soap, extracting with hot dilute acid, filtering,\r\nneutralising this solution to methyl orange, and boiling to expel carbon\r\ndioxide. After cooling, sufficient pure neutralised glycerine is added\r\nto form one-third of the total volume, and the liquid titrated with N/2\r\ncaustic soda solution, using phenol-phthalein as indicator. Each c.c. of\r\nN/2 NaOH solution corresponds to 0.031 gramme crystallised boric acid,\r\nH_{3}BO_{3} or 0.0477 gramme crystallised borax,\r\nNa_{2}B_{4}O_{7}.10H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYES.\r\n\r\nThe amounts of caustic alkali (if any), carbonated alkali, and salt\r\npresent are determined in the manner already described under Alkali and\r\nAlkali Salts. The glycerol content is ascertained by taking 2.5 grammes,\r\nadding lead subacetate solution, and filtering without increasing the\r\nbulk more than is absolutely necessary; the solution is concentrated to\r\nabout 25 c.c., and the oxidation with bichromate and sulphuric acid\r\nconducted as described in the examination of Crude Glycerine. The\r\nsolution, after oxidation, is made up to 250 c.c., and titrated against\r\nstandard ferrous ammonium sulphate solution, the formula for the\r\ncalculation being:--\r\n\r\n                                  {0.25 - 2.5}\r\n          Per cent. of glycerol = {       ---} x 40\r\n                                  {        n }\r\n\r\nwhere n equals the number of c.c. of oxidised lyes required to oxidise\r\nthe ferrous ammonium sulphate solution.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of actual glycerol in this is necessarily a matter of\r\nconsiderable importance, and a very large number of processes, which are\r\nconstantly being added to, have been suggested for the purpose.\r\nHitherto, however, only two methods have been generally adopted, _viz._\r\nthe acetin and the bichromate processes. Unfortunately the results\r\nobtained by these do not invariably agree, the latter, which includes\r\nall oxidisable matter as glycerol, giving sometimes considerably higher\r\nresults, and it has been suggested that a determination should be made\r\nby both methods, and the average of the two results considered the true\r\nvalue. This involves a considerable amount of time and trouble, and it\r\nwill generally be found sufficient in a works laboratory to determine\r\nthe glycerol by one method only in the ordinary course, reserving the\r\nother process for use as a check in case of dispute or doubt.\r\n\r\n_Acetin Method._--This consists in converting the glycerol into its\r\nester with acetic acid, the acetic triglyceride, or triacetin being\r\nformed. This is then saponified with a known volume of standard alkali,\r\nthe excess of which is titrated with acid, and the percentage of\r\nglycerol calculated from the amount of alkali absorbed.\r\n\r\nFrom 1 to 1.5 grammes of the glycerine is weighed into a conical flask\r\nof about 150 c.c. capacity, 7 or 8 c.c. of acetic anhydride added,\r\ntogether with about 3 grammes of anhydrous sodium acetate, and the whole\r\nboiled on a sand-bath under a reflux condenser for one to one and a half\r\nhours, after which it is allowed to cool, 50 c.c. water added, and the\r\nester dissolved by shaking, and gently warming, the reflux condenser\r\nstill being attached as the acetin is very volatile. The solution is\r\nthen filtered from a white flocculent precipitate, which contains most\r\nof the impurities, into a larger conical flask, of some 500-600 c.c.\r\ncapacity, and after cooling, rendered just neutral to phenol-phthalein\r\nby means of N/2 caustic soda solution, the exact point being reached\r\nwhen the solution acquires a reddish-yellow tint; 25 c.c. of a strong\r\ncaustic soda solution is then added, and the liquid boiled for about\r\nfifteen minutes, the excess of alkali being titrated after cooling, with\r\nN/1 or N/2 hydrochloric acid. A blank experiment is carried out\r\nsimultaneously, with another 25 c.c. of the soda solution, and the\r\ndifference in the amounts of acid required by the two, furnishes a\r\nmeasure of the alkali required to saponify the acetin formed, and hence\r\nthe amount of glycerol in the crude glycerine may be calculated.\r\n\r\n_Example._--1.4367 grammes crude glycerine, after treatment with acetic\r\nanhydride, and neutralising, was saponified with 25 c.c. of a 10 per\r\ncent. caustic soda solution.\r\n\r\n       The blank experiment required 111.05 c.c. N/1 hydrochloric acid.\r\n       Flask containing acetin  \"     75.3  c.c.   \"        \"\r\n                                      -----\r\n                                      35.75 c.c.   \"        \"\r\n\r\nHence, the acetin formed from the glycerol present in 1.4367 grammes of\r\nthe crude glycerine required 35.75 c.c. N/1 caustic alkali for its\r\nsaponification, so that the percentage of glycerol may be calculated\r\nfrom the following formula:--\r\n\r\n                                35.75 x 0.03067 x 100\r\n          Per cent. glycerol =  --------------------- = 76.3.\r\n                                        1.4367\r\n\r\n_Bichromate Method._--This process was originally devised by Hehner\r\n(_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1889, 4-9), but the modification suggested by\r\nRichardson and Jaffe (_ibid._, 1898, 330) is preferred by the authors,\r\nand has been practised by them for several years with perfectly\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five grammes of the crude glycerine are weighed out in a beaker,\r\nwashed into a 250 c.c. stoppered flask, and made up to the graduation\r\nmark with water. Twenty-five c.c. of this solution are then measured\r\nfrom a burette into a small beaker, a slight excess of basic lead\r\nacetate solution added to precipitate organic matter, the precipitate\r\nallowed to settle, and the supernatant liquid poured through a filter\r\npaper into another 250 c.c. flask. The precipitate is washed by\r\ndecantation until the flask is nearly full, then transferred to the\r\nfilter, and allowed to drain, a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid being\r\nadded to precipitate the slight excess of basic lead acetate solution,\r\nand the contents of the flask made up with water to 250 c.c. This\r\nsolution is filtered, 20 c.c. measured from a burette into a conical\r\nflask of about 150 c.c. capacity, 25 c.c. of a standard potassium\r\nbichromate solution containing 74.86 grammes bichromate per litre added,\r\ntogether with 50 c.c. of 50 per cent. sulphuric acid, and the whole\r\nplaced in a boiling water-bath for one hour, after which it is allowed\r\nto cool, diluted with water to 250 c.c., and this solution run in to 20\r\nc.c. of a 3 per cent. ferrous ammonium sulphate solution until the\r\nlatter is completely oxidised, as shown by no blue coloration being\r\nproduced when one drop is brought into contact with one drop of a\r\nfreshly prepared solution of potassium ferricyanide on a spot-plate. The\r\nferrous ammonium sulphate solution is previously standardised by\r\ntitration with a potassium bichromate solution of one-tenth the above\r\nstrength, made by diluting 10 c.c. of the strong solution to 100 c.c.\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\nThe reaction taking place in the oxidation may be represented by the\r\nequation:--\r\n\r\n    3C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} + 7K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 28H_{2}SO_{4} =\r\n        9CO_{2} + 40H_{2}O + 7K_{2}SO_{4} + 7Cr_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}.\r\n\r\nNow the strong potassium bichromate solution above mentioned is of such\r\na strength that 1 c.c. will oxidise 0.01 gramme glycerine, and 20 c.c.\r\nof the ferrous ammonium sulphate solution should require about 10 c.c.\r\nof the one-tenth strength bichromate in the blank experiment. If it\r\nrequires more or less than this, then the amount of ferrous ammonium\r\nsulphate solution which would require exactly 10 c.c. (corresponding to\r\n0.01 gramme glycerine) is calculated, and the oxidised glycerine\r\nsolution run into this until oxidation is complete.\r\n\r\nThe formula for the calculation of the percentage of glycerol then\r\nbecomes:--\r\n\r\n                                  {0.25 -(250 x 0.01)}\r\n          Per cent. of glycerol = {       ---------- } x 500,\r\n                                  {            n     }\r\n\r\nwhere n equals the number of c.c. of oxidised glycerine solution\r\nrequired to oxidise the ferrous ammonium sulphate solution.\r\n\r\nExample:--\r\n\r\nIn the blank experiment 20 c.c. ferrous ammonium sulphate solution\r\nrequired 9.8 c.c. one-tenth strength bichromate solution, so that 20.4\r\nc.c. ferrous solution would equal 10 c.c. bichromate.\r\n\r\n20.4 c.c. ferrous solution required 27.8 c.c. of oxidised glycerine\r\nsolution before it ceased to give a blue coloration with potassium\r\nferricyanide.\r\n                                        {0.25 - (250 x 0.01)}\r\n    Therefore, per cent. of glycerol = {       ------------} x 500\r\n                                       {           27.8    }\r\n\r\n                                     = 80.04 per cent.\r\n\r\nOther methods have been suggested for the preliminary purification,\r\n_e.g._, silver oxide, silver carbonate and lead subacetate, and copper\r\nsulphate and caustic potash, but the lead subacetate alone with care\r\ngives satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nOther determinations include those of specific gravity, alkalinity,\r\nproportion of salts and chloride, and tests for metals, arsenic, sulphur\r\ncompounds, sugar, and fatty acids.\r\n\r\n_Specific gravity_ is determined at 15 deg. C., and may be taken in specific\r\ngravity bottle, or with a Westphal balance or hydrometer It usually\r\nranges from 1.3 to 1.31.\r\n\r\n_Alkalinity_, which is usually sodium carbonate, and may be somewhat\r\nconsiderable if the soap has been grained with caustic alkali, is\r\ndetermined after dilution with water by titrating with N/2 acid, using\r\nmethyl orange as indicator.\r\n\r\n_Salts._--These may be determined by gently incinerating 5-6 grammes of\r\nthe glycerine, extracting the carbonaceous mass with distilled water,\r\nfiltering, and evaporating the filtrate on the water bath. The dried\r\nresidue represents the salts in the weight taken.\r\n\r\n_Chloride of sodium_ (common salt) may be estimated by dissolving the\r\ntotal salts in water, adding potassium chromate, and titrating with N/10\r\nsilver nitrate solution.\r\n\r\n_Copper_, _lead_, _iron_, _magnesium_, and _calcium_ may also be tested\r\nfor in the salts, by ordinary reactions.\r\n\r\n_Arsenic_ is best tested for by the Gutzeit method. About 5 c.c. is\r\nplaced in a test-tube, a few fragments of granulated zinc free from\r\narsenic, and 10 c.c. dilute hydrochloric acid added, and the mouth of\r\nthe tube covered with a small filter paper, moistened three successive\r\ntimes with an alcoholic solution of mercury bichloride and dried. After\r\nthirty minutes the filter paper is examined, when a yellow stain will be\r\nobserved if arsenic is present.\r\n\r\n_Sulphates._--These may be precipitated with barium chloride in acid\r\nsolution, in the usual way, dried, ignited, and weighed.\r\n\r\n_Sulphites_ give with barium chloride a precipitate soluble in\r\nhydrochloric acid. If the precipitate is well washed with hot water, and\r\na few drops of iodine solution together with starch paste added, the\r\npresence of sulphites is proved by the gradual disappearance of the blue\r\nstarch-iodine compound first formed.\r\n\r\n_Thiosulphates_ are detected by precipitating any sulphite and sulphate\r\nwith barium chloride, filtering, acidifying, and adding a few drops of\r\npotassium permanganate solution, when in the presence of a mere trace of\r\nthiosulphate, the solution becomes cloudy.\r\n\r\n_Sulphides._--Lewkowitsch recommends testing for these by replacing the\r\nmercury bichloride with lead acetate paper in the Gutzeit arsenic test.\r\nAny sulphide causes a blackening of the lead acetate paper.\r\n\r\n_Sugars_ may be tested for both before and after inversion, by boiling\r\nwith Fehlings' solution, when no reduction should take place, if pure.\r\n\r\n_Fatty acids_ are detected by the turbidity they produce when the\r\ndiluted glycerine is acidified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF THE SOAP INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1853 the amount of soap produced annually in this country\r\nwas readily obtainable from the official returns collected for the\r\npurpose of levying the duty, and the following figures, taken at\r\nintervals of ten years for the half century prior to that date, show the\r\nsteady development of the industry during that period:--\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________________________\r\n|       |               |           |           |               |\r\n| Year. |

being now some 7,000,000 or 8,000,000 cwt. per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nThe number of soap manufacturers in the United Kingdom is nearly 300,\r\nand the amount of capital invested in the industry is roughly
