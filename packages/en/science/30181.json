APPLETON AND COMPANY,\r\n549 AND 551 BROADWAY.\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE BY THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs my name appears on the title-page of this volume, it is necessary\r\nthat I should exactly state what part I had in its preparation. I had\r\nno doubt originally engaged to undertake the work myself; but finding,\r\nfrom multiplicity of engagements and my uncertain health, that I could\r\nnot accomplish it satisfactorily, I thought the best course I could\r\ntake was to recommend Mr. Cooke to the publishers; a gentleman well\r\nknown, not only in this country, but in the United States. The whole\r\nof the work has therefore been prepared by himself, the manuscript and\r\nproof sheets being submitted to me from time to time, in which I\r\nmerely suggested such additions as seemed needful, subjoining\r\noccasionally a few notes. As the work is intended for students, the\r\nauthor has had no hesitation in repeating what has been stated in\r\nformer chapters where it has been thought to prove useful. I have no\r\ndoubt that the same high character will justly apply to this as to Mr.\r\nCooke's former publications, and especially to his \"Handbook of\r\nBritish Fungi.\"\r\n\r\n                                                       M.

To him, the old definition that an animal is possessed of\r\nlife and locomotion, a plant of life without locomotion, and a mineral\r\ndeficient in both, seems to be sufficient, until some day he travels\r\nbeyond the circuit of diurnal routine, and encounters a sponge or a\r\nzoophyte, which possesses only one of his supposed attributes of\r\nanimal life, but which he is assured is nevertheless a member of the\r\nanimal kingdom. Such an encounter usually perplexes the neophyte at\r\nfirst, but rather than confess his generalizations to have been too\r\ngross, he will tenaciously contend that the sponge must be a plant,\r\nuntil the evidence produced is so strong that he is compelled to\r\ndesert his position, and seek refuge in the declaration that one\r\nkingdom runs into the other so imperceptibly that no line of\r\ndemarcation can be drawn between them. Between these two extremes of\r\nbroad distinction, and no distinction, lies the ground occupied by the\r\nscientific student, who, whilst admitting that logical definition\r\nfails in assigning briefly and tersely the bounds of the three\r\nkingdoms, contends that such limits exist so positively, that the\r\nuniversal scientific mind accepts the recognized limit without\r\ncontroversy or contradiction.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, if one kingdom be made the subject of inquiry, the\r\nsame difficulties will arise. A flowering plant, as represented by a\r\nrose or a lily, will be recognized as distinct from a fern, a seaweed,\r\nor a fungus. Yet there are some flowering plants which, at first\r\nsight, and without examination, simulate cryptogams, as, for example,\r\nmany _Balanophoræ_, which the unscientific would at once class with\r\nfungi. It is nevertheless true that even the incipient botanist will\r\naccurately separate the phanerogams from the cryptogams, and by means\r\nof a little more, but still elementary knowledge, distribute the\r\nlatter amongst ferns, mosses, fungi, lichens, and algæ, with\r\ncomparatively few exceptions. It is true that between fungi and\r\nlichens there exists so close an affinity that difficulties arise, and\r\ndoubts, and disputations, regarding certain small groups or a few\r\nspecies; but these are the exception, and not the rule. Botanists\r\ngenerally are agreed in recognizing the five principal groups of\r\nCryptogamia, as natural and distinct. In proportion as we advance from\r\ncomparison of members of the three kingdoms, through that of the\r\nprimary groups in one kingdom, to a comparison of tribes, alliances,\r\nand orders, we shall require closer observation, and more and more\r\neducation of the eye to see, and the mind to appreciate, relationships\r\nand distinctions.\r\n\r\nWe have already assumed that fungi are duly and universally admitted,\r\nas plants, into the vegetable kingdom. But of this fact some have even\r\nventured to doubt. This doubt, however, has been confined to one order\r\nof fungi, except, perhaps, amongst the most illiterate, although now\r\nthe animal nature of the _Myxogastres_ has scarcely a serious advocate\r\nleft. In this order the early condition of the plant is pulpy and\r\ngelatinous, and consists of a substance more allied to sarcode than\r\ncellulose. De Bary insinuated affinities with _Amoeba_,[A] whilst\r\nTulasne affirmed that the outer coat in some of these productions\r\ncontained so much carbonate of lime that strong effervescence took\r\nplace on the application of sulphuric acid. Dr. Henry Carter is well\r\nknown as an old and experienced worker amongst amoeboid forms of\r\nanimal life, and, when in Bombay, he devoted himself to the\r\nexamination of the _Myxogastres_ in their early stage, and the result\r\nof his examinations has been a firm conviction that there is no\r\nrelationship whatever between the _Myxogastres_ and the lower forms of\r\nanimal life. De Bary has himself very much modified, if not wholly\r\nabandoned, the views once propounded by him on this subject. When\r\nmature, and the dusty spores, mixed with threads, sometimes spiral,\r\nare produced, the _Myxogastres_ are so evidently close allies of the\r\n_Lycoperdons_, or Puffballs, as to leave no doubt of their affinities.\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to remark that the presence of zoospores is\r\nno proof of animal nature, for not only do they occur in the white\r\nrust (_Cystopus_), and in such moulds as _Peronospora_,[B] but are\r\ncommon in algæ, the vegetable nature of which has never been\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\nThere is another equally important, but more complicated subject to\r\nwhich we must allude in this connection. This is the probability of\r\nminute fungi being developed without the intervention of germs, from\r\ncertain solutions. The observations of M. Trécul, in a paper laid\r\nbefore the French Academy, have thus been summarized:--1. Yeast cells\r\nmay be formed in the must of beer without spores being previously\r\nsown. 2. Cells of the same form as those of yeast, but with different\r\ncontents, arise spontaneously in simple solution of sugar, or to which\r\na little tartrate of ammonia has been added, and these cells are\r\ncapable of producing fermentation in certain liquids under favourable\r\nconditions. 3. The cells thus formed produce _Penicillium_ like the\r\ncells of yeast. 4. On the other hand, the spores of _Penicillium_ are\r\ncapable of being transformed into yeast.[C] The interpretation of this\r\nis, that the mould _Penicillium_ may be produced from a sugar\r\nsolution by \"spontaneous generation,\" and without spore or germ of any\r\nkind. The theory is, that a molecular mass which is developed in\r\ncertain solutions or infusions, may, under the influence of different\r\ncircumstances, produce either animalcules or fungi. \"In all these\r\ncases, no kind of animalcule or fungus is ever seen to originate from\r\npreexisting cells or larger bodies, but always from molecules.\"[D] The\r\nmolecules are said to form small masses, which soon melt together to\r\nconstitute a globular body, from which a process juts out on one side.\r\nThese are the so-called _Torulæ_,[E] which give off buds which are\r\nsoon transformed into jointed tubes of various diameters, terminating\r\nin rows of sporules, _Penicillium_, or capsules containing numerous\r\nglobular seeds, _Aspergillus_ (_sic_).\r\n\r\nThis is but another mode of stating the same thing as above referred\r\nto by M. Trécul, that certain cells, resembling yeast cells (_Torula_),\r\nare developed spontaneously, and that these ultimately pass through the\r\nform of mould called _Penicillium_ to the more complex _Mucor_ (which\r\nthe writer evidently has confounded with _Aspergillus_, unless he\r\nalludes to the ascigerous form of _Aspergillus_, long known as\r\n_Eurotium_). From what is now known of the polymorphism of fungi, there\r\nwould be little difficulty in believing that cells resembling yeast\r\ncells would develop into _Penicillium_, as they do in _fact_ in what is\r\ncalled the \"vinegar plant,\" and that the capsuliferous, or higher\r\ncondition of this mould may be a _Mucor_, in which the sporules are\r\nproduced in capsules. The difficulty arises earlier, in the supposed\r\nspontaneous origination of yeast cells from molecules, which result from\r\nthe peculiar conditions of light, temperature, &c., in which certain\r\nsolutions are placed. It would be impossible to review all the\r\narguments, or tabulate all the experiments, which have been employed\r\nfor and against this theory. It could not be passed over in silence,\r\nsince it has been one of the stirring questions of the day. The great\r\nproblem how to exclude all germs from the solutions experimented\r\nupon, and to keep them excluded, lies at the foundation of the theory.\r\nIt must ever, as we think, be matter of doubt that all germs were not\r\nexcluded or destroyed, rather than one of belief that forms known to be\r\ndeveloped day by day from germs should under other conditions\r\noriginate spontaneously.\r\n\r\nFungi are veritably and unmistakably plants, of a low organization, it\r\nis true, but still plants, developed from germs, somewhat analogous,\r\nbut not wholly homologous, to the seeds of higher orders. The process\r\nof fertilization is still obscure, but facts are slowly and gradually\r\naccumulating, so that we may hope at some not very distant period to\r\ncomprehend what as yet are little removed from hypotheses. Admitting\r\nthat fungi are independent plants, much more complex in their\r\nrelations and development than was formerly supposed, it will be\r\nexpected that certain forms should be comparatively permanent, that\r\nis, that they should constitute good species. Here, also, efforts have\r\nbeen made to develop a theory that there are no legitimate species\r\namongst fungi, accepting the terms as hitherto applied to flowering\r\nplants. In this, as in allied instances, too hasty generalizations\r\nhave been based on a few isolated facts, without due comprehension of\r\nthe true interpretation of such facts and phenomena. Polymorphism will\r\nhereafter receive special illustration, but meantime it may be well to\r\nstate that, because some forms of fungi which have been described, and\r\nwhich have borne distinct names as autonomous species, are now proved\r\nto be only stages or conditions of other species, there is no reason\r\nfor concluding that no forms are autonomous, or that fungi which\r\nappear and are developed in successive stages are not, in their\r\nentirety, good species. Instead, therefore, of insinuating that there\r\nare no good species, modern investigation tends rather to the\r\nestablishment of good species, and the elimination of those that are\r\nspurious. It is chiefly amongst the microscopic species that\r\npolymorphism has been determined. In the larger and fleshy fungi\r\nnothing has been discovered which can shake our faith in the species\r\ndescribed half a century, or more, ago. In the Agarics, for instance,\r\nthe forms seem to be as permanent and as distinct as in the flowering\r\nplants. In fact, there is still no reason to dissent, except to a very\r\nlimited extent, from what was written before polymorphism was\r\naccredited, that, \"with a few exceptions only, it may without doubt be\r\nasserted that more certain species do not exist in any part of the\r\norganized world than amongst fungi. The same species constantly recur\r\nin the same places, and if kinds not hitherto detected present\r\nthemselves, they are either such as are well known in other districts,\r\nor species which have been overlooked, and which are found on better\r\nexperience to be widely diffused. There is nothing like chance about\r\ntheir characters or growth.\"[F]\r\n\r\nThe parasitism of numerous minute species on living and growing plants\r\nhas its parallel even amongst phanerogams in the mistletoe and\r\nbroom-rape and similar species. Amongst fungi a large number are thus\r\nparasitic, distorting, and in many cases ultimately destroying, their\r\nhost, burrowing within the tissues, and causing rust and smut in corn\r\nand grasses, or even more destructive and injurious in such moulds as\r\nthose of the potato disease and its allies. A still larger number of\r\nfungi are developed from decayed or decaying vegetable matter. These\r\nare found in winter on dead leaves, twigs, branches, rotten wood, the\r\nremains of herbaceous plants, and soil largely charged with\r\ndisintegrated vegetables. As soon as a plant begins to decay it\r\nbecomes the source of a new vegetation, which hastens its destruction,\r\nand a new cycle of life commences. In these instances, whether\r\nparasitic on living plants or developed on dead ones, the source is\r\nstill vegetable. But this is not always the case, so that it cannot be\r\npredicated that fungi are wholly epiphytal. Some species are always\r\nfound on animal matter, leather, horn, bone, &c., and some affect such\r\nunpromising substances as minerals, from which it would be supposed\r\nthat no nourishment could be obtained, not only hard gravel stones,\r\nfragments of rock, but also metals, such as iron and lead, of which\r\nmore may be said when we come to treat of the habitats of fungi.\r\nAlthough in general terms fungi may be described as \"hysterophytal or\r\nepiphytal mycetals deriving nourishment by means of a mycelium from\r\nthe matrix,\"[G] there are exceptions to this rule with which the\r\nmajority accord.\r\n\r\nOf the fungi found on animal substances, none are more extraordinary\r\nthan those species which attack insects. The white mould which in\r\nautumn proves so destructive to the common house-fly may for the\r\npresent be omitted, as it is probably a condition of one of the\r\n_Saprolegniei_, which some authors include with fungi, and others with\r\nalgæ. Wasps, spiders, moths, and butterflies become enveloped in a\r\nkind of mould named _Isaria_, which constitutes the conidia of\r\n_Torrubia_, a genus of club-shaped _Sphæriæ_ afterwards developed.\r\nSome species of _Isaria_ and _Torrubia_ also affect the larvæ and pupæ\r\nof moths and butterflies, converting the whole interior into a mass of\r\nmycelium, and fructifying in a clavate head. It has been subject for\r\ndiscussion whether in such instances the fungus commenced its\r\ndevelopment during the life of the insect, and thus hastened its\r\ndeath, or whether it resulted after death, and was subsequent to the\r\ncommencement of decay.[H] The position in which certain large moths\r\nare found standing on leaves when infested with _Isaria_ resembles so\r\nclosely that of the house-fly when succumbing to _Sporendonema Muscæ_,\r\nwould lead to the conclusion that certainly in some cases the insect\r\nwas attacked by the fungus whilst still living; whilst in the case of\r\nburied caterpillars, such as the New Zealand or British _Hepialus_, it\r\nis difficult to decide. Whether in life or death in these instances,\r\nit is clear that the silk-worm disease _Muscardine_ attacks the living\r\ninsect, and causes death. In the case of the _Guêpes végétantes_, the\r\nwasp is said to fly about with the fungus partially developed.\r\n\r\nIn all fungi we may recognize a vegetative and a reproductive system:\r\nsometimes the first only becomes developed, and then the fungus is\r\nimperfect, and sometimes the latter is far more prominent than the\r\nformer. There is usually an agglomeration of delicate threads,\r\neither jointed or not, which are somewhat analogous to the roots of\r\nhigher plants. These delicate threads permeate the tissues of\r\nplants attacked by parasitic fungi, or they run over dead leaves\r\nforming whitened patches, formerly bearing the name of _Himantia_,\r\nbut really the mycelium of some species of _Marasmius_. If checked\r\nor disturbed, the process stops here, and only a mycelium of\r\ninterwoven threads is produced. In this condition the mycelium of one\r\nspecies so much resembles that of another, that no accurate\r\ndetermination can be made. If the process goes on, this mycelium gives\r\nrise to the stem and cap of an agaricoid fungus, completing the\r\nvegetative system. This in turn gives origin to a spore-bearing\r\nsurface, and ultimately the fruit is formed, and then the fungus is\r\ncomplete; no fungus can be regarded as perfect or complete without\r\nits reproductive system being developed. In some this is very\r\nsimple, in others it is as complex. In many of the moulds we have\r\nminiature representatives of higher plants in the mycelium or\r\nroots, stem, branches, and at length capsules bearing sporidia, which\r\ncorrespond to seeds. It is true that leaves are absent, but these are\r\nsometimes compensated by lateral processes or abortive branchlets.\r\nA tuft of mould is in miniature a forest of trees. Although such a\r\ndefinition may be deemed more poetic than accurate, more figurative\r\nthan literal, yet few could believe in the marvellous beauty of a\r\ntuft of mould if they never saw it as exhibited under the microscope.\r\nIn such a condition no doubt could be entertained of its vegetable\r\ncharacter. But there is a lower phase in which these plants are\r\nsometimes encountered; they may consist only of single cells, or\r\nstrings of cells, or threads of simple structure floating in\r\nfluids. In such conditions only the vegetative system is probably\r\ndeveloped, and that imperfectly, yet some have ventured to give\r\nnames to isolated cells, or strings of cells, or threads of\r\nmycelium, which really in themselves possess none of the elements\r\nof correct classification--the vegetative system, even, being\r\nimperfect, and consequently the reproductive is absent. As already\r\nobserved, no fungus is perfect without fruit of some kind, and the\r\npeculiarities of structure and development of fruit form one of the\r\nmost important elements in classification. To attempt, therefore, to\r\ngive names to such imperfect fragments of undeveloped plants is\r\nalmost as absurd as to name a flowering plant from a stray\r\nfragment of a root-fibril accidentally cast out of the ground--nay,\r\neven worse, for identification would probably be easier. It is well to\r\nprotest at all times against attempts to push science to the verge\r\nof absurdity; and such must be the verdict upon endeavours to\r\ndetermine positively such incomplete organisms as floating cells,\r\nor hyaline threads which may belong to any one of fifty species of\r\nmoulds, or after all to an alga. This leads us to remark, in\r\npassing, that there are forms and conditions under which fungi may\r\nbe found when, fructification being absent--that is, the vegetative\r\nsystem alone developed--they approximate so closely to algæ that it\r\nis almost impossible to say to which group the organisms belong.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is a great characteristic of fungi in general that they\r\nare very rapid in growth, and rapid in decay. In a night a puffball\r\nwill grow prodigiously, and in the same short period a mass of paste\r\nmay be covered with mould. In a few hours a gelatinous mass of\r\n_Reticularia_ will pass into a bladder of dust, or a _Coprinus_ will\r\nbe dripping into decay. Remembering this, mycophagists will take note\r\nthat a fleshy fungus which may be good eating at noon may undergo such\r\nchanges in a few hours as to be anything but good eating at night.\r\nMany instances have been recorded of the rapidity of growth in fungi;\r\nit may also be accepted as an axiom that they are, in many instances,\r\nequally as rapid in decay.\r\n\r\nThe affinity between lichens and fungi has long been recognized to its\r\nfull and legitimate extent by lichenologists and mycologists.[I] In\r\nthe \"Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany,\" it was proposed to unite\r\nthem in one alliance, under the name of _Mycetales_, in the same\r\nmanner as the late Dr. Lindley had united allied orders under\r\nalliances in his \"Vegetable Kingdom;\" but, beyond this, there was no\r\npredisposition towards the theory since propounded, and which, like\r\nall new theories, has collected a small but zealous circle of\r\nadherents. It will be necessary briefly to summarize this theory and\r\nthe arguments by which it is supported and opposed, inasmuch as it is\r\nintimately connected with our subject.\r\n\r\nAs recently as 1868, Professor Schwendener first propounded his\r\nviews,[J] and then briefly and vaguely, that all and every individual\r\nlichen was but an algal, which had collected about it a parasitic\r\nfungal growth, and that those peculiar bodies which, under the name of\r\n_gonidia_, were considered as special organs of lichens, were only\r\nimprisoned algæ. In language which the Rev. J. M. Crombie[K] describes\r\nas \"pictorial,\" this author gave the general conclusion at which he\r\nhad arrived, as follows:--\"As the result of my researches, all these\r\ngrowths are not simple plants, not individuals in the usual sense of\r\nthe term; they are rather colonies, which consist of hundreds and\r\nthousands of individuals, of which, however, only one acts as master,\r\nwhile the others, in perpetual captivity, provide nourishment for\r\nthemselves and their master. This master is a fungus of the order\r\n_Ascomycetes_, a parasite which is accustomed to live upon the work of\r\nothers; its slaves are green algæ, which it has sought out, or indeed\r\ncaught hold of, and forced into its service. It surrounds them, as a\r\nspider does its prey, with a fibrous net of narrow meshes, which is\r\ngradually converted into an impenetrable covering. While, however, the\r\nspider sucks its prey and leaves it lying dead, the fungus incites the\r\nalgæ taken in its net to more rapid activity; nay, to more vigorous\r\nincrease.\" This hypothesis, ushered upon the world with all the\r\nprestige of the Professor's name, was not long in meeting with\r\nadherents, and the cardinal points insisted upon were--1st. That the\r\ngeneric relationship of the coloured \"gonidia\" to the colourless\r\nfilaments which compose the lichen thallus, had only been assumed, and\r\nnot proved; 2nd. That the membrane of the gonidia was chemically\r\ndifferent from the membrane of the other tissues, inasmuch as the\r\nfirst had a reaction corresponding to that of algæ, whilst the second\r\nhad that of fungi; 3rd. That the different forms and varieties of\r\ngonidia corresponded with parallel types of algæ; 4th. That as the\r\ngermination of the spore had not been followed further than the\r\ndevelopment of a hypothallus, it might be accounted for by the absence\r\nof the essential algal on which the new organism should become\r\nparasitic; 5th. That there is a striking correspondence between the\r\ndevelopment of the fruit in lichens and in some of the sporidiiferous\r\nfungi (_Pyrenomycetes_).\r\n\r\nThese five points have been combated incessantly by lichenologists,\r\nwho would really be supposed by ordinary minds to be the most\r\npractically acquainted with the structure and development of these\r\nplants, in opposition to the theorists. It is a fact which should have\r\nsome weight, that no lichenologist of repute has as yet accepted the\r\ntheory. In 1873 Dr. E. Bornet[L] came to the aid of Schwendener, and\r\nalmost exhausted the subject, but failed to convince either the\r\npractised lichenologist or mycologist. The two great points sought to\r\nbe established are these, that what we call lichens are compound\r\norganisms, not simple, independent vegetable entities; and that this\r\ncompound organism consists of unicellular algæ, with a fungus\r\nparasitic upon them. The coloured gonidia which are found in the\r\nsubstance, or thallus of lichens, are the supposed algæ; and the\r\ncellular structure which surrounds, encloses, and imprisons the\r\ngonidia is the parasitic fungus, which is parasitic on something\r\ninfinitely smaller than itself, and which it entirely and absolutely\r\nisolates from all external influences.\r\n\r\nDr. Bornet believed himself to have established that every gonidium of\r\na lichen may be referred to a species of algæ, and that the connection\r\nbetween the hypha and gonidia is of such a nature as to exclude all\r\npossibility of the one organ being produced by the other. This he\r\nthinks is the only way in which it can be accounted for that the\r\ngonidia of diverse lichens should be almost identical.\r\n\r\nDr. Nylander, in referring to this hypothesis of an imprisoned\r\nalgal,[M] writes: \"The absurdity of such an hypothesis is evident from\r\nthe very consideration that it cannot be the case that an organ\r\n(gonidia) should at the same time be a parasite on the body of which\r\nit exercises vital functions; for with equal propriety it might be\r\ncontended that the liver or the spleen constitutes parasites of the\r\nmammiferæ. Parasite existence is autonomous, living upon a foreign\r\nbody, of which nature prohibits it from being at the same time an\r\norgan. This is an elementary axiom of general physiology. But\r\nobservation directly made teaches that the green matter originally\r\narises within the primary chlorophyll- or phycochrom-bearing cellule,\r\nand consequently is not intruded from any external quarter, nor arises\r\nin any way from any parasitism of any kind. The cellule at first is\r\nobserved to be empty, and then, by the aid of secretion, green matter\r\nis gradually produced in the cavity and assumes a definite form. It\r\ncan, therefore, be very easily and evidently demonstrated that the\r\norigin of green matter in lichens is entirely the same as in other\r\nplants.\" On another occasion, and in another place, the same eminent\r\nlichenologist remarks,[N] as to the supposed algoid nature of\r\ngonidia--\"that such an unnatural existence as they would thus pass,\r\nenclosed in a prison and deprived of all autonomous liberty, is not\r\nat all consonant with the manner of existence of the other algæ, and\r\nthat it has no parallel in nature, for nothing physiologically\r\nanalogous occurs anywhere else. Krempelhuber has argued that there are\r\nno conclusive reasons against the assumption that the lichen-gonidia\r\nmay be self-developed organs of the lichen proper rather than algæ,\r\nand that these gonidia can continue to vegetate separately, and so be\r\nmistaken for unicellular algæ.\" In this Th. Fries seems substantially\r\nto concur. But there is one strong argument, or rather a repetition of\r\nan argument already cited, placed in a much stronger light, which is\r\nemployed by Nylander in the following words:--\"So far are what are\r\ncalled algæ, according to the turbid hypothesis of Schwendener, from\r\nconstituting true algæ, that on the contrary it may be affirmed that\r\nthey have a lichenose nature, whence it follows that these pseudo-algæ\r\nare in a systematic arrangement to be referred rather to the lichens,\r\nand that the class of algæ hitherto so vaguely limited should be\r\ncircumscribed by new and truer limits.\"\r\n\r\nAs to another phase in this question, there are, as Krempelhuber\r\nremarks, species of lichens which in many countries do not fructify,\r\nand whose propagation can only be carried on by means of the soredia,\r\nand the hyphæ of such could in themselves alone no more serve for\r\npropagation than the hyphæ from the pileus or stalk of an Agaric,\r\nwhile it is highly improbable that they could acquire this faculty by\r\ninterposition of a foreign algal. On the other hand he argues: \"It is\r\nmuch more conformable to nature that the gonidia, as self-developed\r\norgans of the lichens, should, like the spores, enable the hyphæ\r\nproceeding from them to propagate the individual.\"[O]\r\n\r\nA case in point has been adduced[P] in which gonidia were produced by\r\nthe hypha, and the genus _Emericella_,[Q] which is allied to _Husseia_\r\nin the _Trichogastres_, shows a structure in the stem exactly\r\nresembling _Palmella botryoides_ of Greville, and to what occurs in\r\n_Synalyssa_. _Emericella_, with one or two other genera, must,\r\nhowever, be considered as connecting _Trichogastres_ with lichens, and\r\nthe question cannot be considered as satisfactorily decided till a\r\nseries of experiments has been made on the germination of lichen\r\nspores and their relation to free algæ considered identical with\r\ngonidia. Mr. Thwaites was the first to point out[R] the relation of\r\nthe gonidia in the different sections of lichens to different types of\r\nsupposed algæ. The question cannot be settled by mere _à priori_\r\nnotions. It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that in _Chionyphe Carteri_\r\nthe threads grow over the cysts exactly as the hypha of lichens is\r\nrepresented as growing over the gonidia.\r\n\r\nRecently, Dr. Thwaites has communicated his views on one phase of this\r\ncontroversy,[S] which will serve to illustrate the question as seen\r\nfrom the mycological side. As is well known, this writer has had\r\nconsiderable experience in the study of the anatomy and physiology of\r\nall the lower cryptogamia, and any suggestion of his on such a subject\r\nwill at least commend itself to a patient consideration.\r\n\r\n\"According to our experience,\" he writes, \"I think parasitic fungi\r\ninvariably produce a sad effect upon the tissues they fix themselves\r\nupon or in. These tissues become pale in colour, and in every respect\r\nsickly in appearance. But who has ever seen the gonidia of lichens the\r\nworse for having the 'hypha' growing amongst them? These gonidia are\r\nalways in the plumpest state, and with the freshest, healthiest colour\r\npossible. Cannot it enter into the heads of these most patient and\r\nexcellent observers, that a cryptogamic plant may have two kinds of\r\ntissue growing side by side, without the necessity of one being\r\nparasitic upon the other, just as one of the higher plants may have\r\nhalf a dozen kinds of tissue making up its organization? The\r\nbeautifully symmetrical growth of the same lichens has seemed to me a\r\nsufficient argument against one portion being parasitic upon another,\r\nbut when we see all harmony and robust health, the idea that one\r\nportion is subsisting parasitically upon another appears to me to be a\r\nperfect absurdity.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears to us that a great deal of confusion and a large number of\r\nerrors which creep into our modern generalizations and hypotheses, may\r\nbe traced to the acceptance of analogies for identities. How many\r\ncases of mistaken identity has the improvement of microscopes revealed\r\nduring the past quarter of a century. This should at least serve as a\r\ncaution for the future.\r\n\r\nApart, however, from the \"gonidia,\" whatever they may be, is the\r\nremainder of the lichen a genuine fungus? Nylander writes, \"The\r\nanatomical filamentose elements of lichens are distinguished by\r\nvarious characters from the hyphæ of fungi. They are firmer, elastic,\r\nand at once present themselves in the texture of lichens. On the other\r\nhand, the hyphæ of fungi are very soft, they possess a thin wall, and\r\nare not at all gelatinous, while they are immediately dissolved by the\r\napplication of hydrate of potash, &c.\"[T]\r\n\r\nOur own experience is somewhat to the effect, that there are some few\r\nlichens which are doubtful as to whether they are fungi or lichens,\r\nbut, in by far the majority of cases, there is not the slightest\r\ndifficulty in determining, from the peculiar firmness and elasticity\r\nof the tissues, minute peculiarities which the practised hand can\r\ndetect rather than describe, and even the general character of the\r\nfruit that they differ materially from, though closely allied to\r\nfungi. We have only experience to guide us in these matters, but that\r\nis something, and we have no experience in fungi of anything like a\r\n_Cladonia_, however much it may resemble a _Torrubia_ or _Clavaria_.\r\nWe have _Pezizæ_ with a subiculum in the section _Tapesia_, but the\r\nveriest tyro would not confound them with species of _Parmelia_. It is\r\ntrue that a great number of lichens, at first sight, and casually,\r\nresemble species of the _Hysteriacei_, but it is no less strange than\r\ntrue, that lichenologists and mycologists know their own sufficiently\r\nnot to commit depredations on each other.\r\n\r\nContributions are daily being made to this controversy, and already\r\nthe principal arguments on both sides have appeared in an English\r\ndress,[U] hence it will be unnecessary to repeat those which are\r\nmodifications only of the views already stated, our own conclusions\r\nbeing capable of a very brief summary: that lichens and fungi are\r\nclosely related the one to the other, but that they are not identical;\r\nthat the \"gonidia\" of lichens are part of the lichen-organization, and\r\nconsequently are not algæ, or any introduced bodies; that there is no\r\nparasitism; and that the lichen thallus, exclusive of gonidia, is\r\nwholly unknown amongst fungi.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. M. Crombie has therefore our sympathies in the remark with\r\nwhich his summary of the gonidia controversy closes, in which he\r\ncharacterizes it as a \"sensational romance of lichenology,\" of the\r\n\"unnatural union between a captive algal damsel and a tyrant fungal\r\nmaster.\"\r\n\r\n   [A] De Bary, \"Des Myxomycètes,\" in \"Ann. des Sci.

He says, \"Such being\r\n       the relations between the organs of reproduction and the\r\n       foliage, it is to some extent possible to understand the\r\n       connection between parasitic plants like fungi, which do not\r\n       derive their support from the constructive energy of their\r\n       fronds, and those which are self-supporting and possess true\r\n       fronds. In the highest classes of plants the flowers are\r\n       connected with the leaves, more especially by means of\r\n       xanthophyll and yellow xanthophyll, whereas in the case of\r\n       lichens the apothecia contain very little, if any, of those\r\n       substances, but a large amount of the lichenoxanthines so\r\n       characteristic of the class. Looking upon fungi from this\r\n       chromatological point of view, they bear something like the\r\n       same relation to lichens that the petals of a leafless\r\n       parasitic plant would bear to the foliage of one of normal\r\n       character--that is to say, they are, as it were, the coloured\r\n       organs of reproduction of parasitic plants of a type closely\r\n       approaching that of lichens, which, of course, is in very\r\n       close, if not in absolute agreement with the conclusions drawn\r\n       by botanists from entirely different data.\"\r\n\r\n   [J] Schwendener, \"Untersuchungen über den Flechtenthallus.\"\r\n\r\n   [K] Crombie (J.

Yet there is so\r\ngreat a variety in the structure of the different groups, that this\r\nsubject cannot be compressed within a few paragraphs, neither do we\r\nthink that this would be desired if practicable, seeing that the\r\nanatomy and physiology of plants is, in itself, sufficiently important\r\nand interesting to warrant a rather extended and explicit survey. In\r\norder to impart as much practical utility as possible to this chapter,\r\nit seems advisable to treat some of the most important and typical\r\norders and suborders separately, giving prominence to the features\r\nwhich are chiefly characteristic of those sections, following the\r\norder of systematists as much as possible, whilst endeavouring to\r\nrender each section independent to a considerable extent, and complete\r\nin itself. Some groups naturally present more noteworthy features than\r\nothers, and will consequently seem to receive more than their\r\nproportional share of attention, but this seeming inequality could\r\nscarcely have been avoided, inasmuch as hitherto some groups have been\r\nmore closely investigated than others, are more intimately associated\r\nwith other questions, or are more readily and satisfactorily examined\r\nunder different aspects of their life-history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Agaric in Process of Growth.]\r\n\r\nAGARICINI.--For the structure that prevails in the order to which the\r\nmushroom belongs, an examination of that species will be almost\r\nsufficient. Here we shall at once recognize three distinct parts\r\nrequiring elucidation, viz. the rooting slender fibres that traverse\r\nthe soil, and termed the _mycelium_, or spawn, the stem and cap or\r\npileus, which together constitute what is called the _hymenophore_,\r\nand the plates or gills on the under surface of the cap, which bear\r\nthe _hymenium_. The earliest condition in which the mushroom can be\r\nrecognized as a vegetable entity is in that of the \"spawn\" or\r\nmycelium, which is essentially an agglomeration of vegetating spores.\r\nIts normal form is that of branched, slender, entangled, anastomosing,\r\nhyaline threads. At certain privileged points of the mycelium, the\r\nthreads seem to be aggregated, and become centres of vertical\r\nextension. At first only a small nearly globose budding, like a grain\r\nof mustard seed, is visible, but this afterwards increases rapidly,\r\nand other similar buddings or swellings appear at the base.[A] These\r\nare the young hymenophore. As it pushes through the soil, it\r\ngradually loses its globose form, becomes more or less elongated, and\r\nin this condition a longitudinal section shows the position of the\r\nfuture gills in a pair of opposite crescent-shaped darker-coloured\r\nspots near the apex. The dermal membrane, or outer skin, seems to be\r\ncontinuous over the stem and the globose head. At present, there is no\r\nexternal evidence of an expanded pileus and gills; a longitudinal\r\nsection at this stage shows that the gills are being developed, that\r\nthe pileus is assuming its cap-like form, that the membrane stretching\r\nfrom the stem to the edge of the young pileus is separating from the\r\nedge of the gills, and forming a _veil_, which, in course of time,\r\nwill separate below and leave the gills exposed. When, therefore, the\r\nmushroom has arrived almost at maturity, the pileus expands, and in\r\nthis act the veil is torn away from the margin of the cap, and remains\r\nfor a time like a collar around the stem. Fragments of the veil often\r\nremain attached to the margin of the pileus, and the collar adherent\r\nto the stem falls back, and thenceforth is known as the _annulus_ or\r\nring. We have in this stage the fully-developed hymenophore,--the stem\r\nwith its ring, supporting an expanded cap or pileus, with gills on the\r\nunder surface bearing the hymenium.[B] A longitudinal section cut\r\nthrough the pileus and down the stem, gives the best notion of the\r\narrangement of the parts, and their relation to the whole. By this\r\nmeans it will be seen that the pileus is continuous with the stem,\r\nthat the substance of the pileus descends into the gills, and that\r\nrelatively the substance of the stem is more fibrous than that of the\r\npileus. In the common mushroom the ring is very distinct surrounding\r\nthe stem, a little above the middle, like a collar. In some Agarics\r\nthe ring is very fugacious, or absent altogether. The form of the\r\ngills, their mode of attachment to the stem, their colour, and more\r\nespecially the colour of the spores, are all very important features\r\nto be attended to in the discrimination of species, since they vary in\r\ndifferent species. The whole substance of the Agaric is cellular. A\r\nlongitudinal slice from the stem will exhibit under the microscope\r\ndelicate tubular cells, the general direction of which is lengthwise,\r\nwith lateral branches, the whole interlacing so intimately that it is\r\ndifficult to trace any individual thread very far in its course. It\r\nwill be evident that the structure is less compact as it approaches\r\nthe centre of the stem, which in many species is hollow. The\r\n_hymenium_ is the spore-bearing surface, which is exposed or naked,\r\nand spread over the gills. These plates are covered on all sides with\r\na delicate membrane, upon which the reproductive organs are developed.\r\nIf it were possible to remove this membrane in one entire piece and\r\nspread it out flat, it would cover an immense surface, as compared\r\nwith the size of the pileus, for it is plaited or folded like a lady's\r\nfan over the whole of the gill-plates, or lamellæ, of the fungus.[C]\r\nIf the stem of a mushroom be cut off close to the gills, and the cap\r\nlaid upon a sheet of paper, with the gills downwards, and left there\r\nfor a few hours, when removed a number of dark radiating lines will be\r\ndeposited upon the paper, each line corresponding with the interstices\r\nbetween one pair of gills. These lines are made up of spores which\r\nhave fallen from the hymenium, and, if placed under the microscope,\r\ntheir character will at once be made evident. If a fragment of the\r\nhymenium be also submitted to a similar examination, it will be found\r\nthat the whole surface is studded with spores. The first peculiarity\r\nwhich will be observed is, that these spores are almost uniformly in\r\ngroups of four together. The next feature to be observed is, that each\r\nspore is borne upon a slender stalk or sterigma, and that four of\r\nthese sterigmata proceed from the apex of a thicker projection, from\r\nthe hymenium, called a _basidium_, each basidium being the supporter\r\nof four sterigmata, and each sterigma of a spore.[D] A closer\r\nexamination of the hymenium will reveal the fact that the basidia are\r\naccompanied by other bodies, often larger, but without sterigmata or\r\nspores; these have been termed _cystidia_, and their structure and\r\nfunctions have been the subject of much controversy.[E] Both kinds of\r\nbodies are produced on the hymenium of most, if not all, the\r\nAgaricini.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Section of Common Mushroom.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--_a._ Sterile cells. _b._ Basidia. _c._ Cystidium.\r\nFrom _Gomphidius_ (de Seynes).]\r\n\r\nThe basidia are usually expanded upwards, so as to have more or less\r\nof a clavate form, surmounted by four slender points, or tubular\r\nprocesses, each supporting a spore; the contents of these cells are\r\ngranular, mixed apparently with oleaginous particles, which\r\ncommunicate through the slender tubes of the spicules with the\r\ninterior of the spores. Corda states that, although only one spore is\r\nproduced at a time on each sporophore, when this falls away others are\r\nproduced in succession for a limited period. As the spores approach\r\nmaturity, the connection between their contents and the contents of\r\nthe basidia diminishes and ultimately ceases. When the basidium which\r\nbears mature spores is still well charged with granular matter, it may\r\nbe presumed that the production of a second or third series of spores\r\nis quite possible. Basidia exhausted entirely of their contents, and\r\nwhich have become quite hyaline, may often be observed.\r\n\r\nThe cystidia are usually larger than the basidia, varying in size and\r\nform in different species. They present the appearance of large\r\nsterile cells, attenuated upwards, sometimes into a slender neck.\r\nCorda was of opinion that these were male organs, and gave them the\r\nname of _pollinaires_. Hoffmann has also described[F] both these\r\norgans under the names of _pollinaria_ and _spermatia_, but does not\r\nappear to recognize in them the sexual elements which those names\r\nwould indicate; whilst de Seynes suggests that the cystidia are only\r\norgans returned to vegetative functions by a sort of hypertrophy of\r\nthe basidia.[G] This view seems to be supported by the fact that, in\r\nthe section _Pluteus_ and some others, the cystidia are surmounted by\r\nshort horns resembling sterigmata. Hoffmann has also indicated[H] the\r\npassage of cystidia into basidia. The evidence seems to be in favour\r\nof regarding the cystidia as barren conditions of basidia. There are\r\nto be found upon the hymenium of Agarics a third kind of elongated\r\ncells, called by Corda[I] basilary cells, and by Hoffmann \"sterile\r\ncells,\" which are either equal in size or smaller than the basidia,\r\nwith which also their structure agrees, excepting in the development\r\nof spicules. These are the \"proper cells of the hymenium\" of Léveillé,\r\nand are simply the terminal cells of the gill structure--cells which,\r\nunder vigorous conditions, might be developed into basidia, but which\r\nare commonly arrested in their development. As suggested by de Seynes,\r\nthe hymenium seems to be reduced to great simplicity, \"one sole and\r\nself-same organ is the basis of it; according as it experiences an\r\narrest of development, as it grows and fructifies, or as it becomes\r\nhypertrophied, it gives us a paraphyse, a basidium, or a cystidium--in\r\nother terms, atrophied basidium, normal basidium and hypertrophied\r\nbasidium; these are the three elements which form the hymenium.\"[J]\r\n\r\nThe only reproductive organs hitherto demonstrated in Agarics are the\r\nspores, or, as sometimes called, from their method of production,\r\n_basidiospores_.[K] These are at first colourless, but afterwards\r\nacquire the colour peculiar to the species. In size and form they are,\r\nwithin certain limits, exceedingly variable, although form and size\r\nare tolerably constant in the same species. At first all are globose;\r\nas they mature, the majority are ovoid or elliptic; some are fusiform,\r\nwith regularly attenuated extremities. In _Hygrophorus_ they are\r\nrather irregular, reniform, or compressed in the middle. Sometimes the\r\nexternal surface is rough with more or less projecting warts. Some\r\nmycologists are of opinion that the covering of the spore is double,\r\nconsisting of an _exospore_ and an _endospore_, the latter being very\r\nfine and delicate. In other orders the double coating of the spore has\r\nbeen demonstrated. When the spore is coloured, the external membrane\r\nalone appears to possess colour, the endospore being constantly\r\nhyaline. It may be added here, that in this order the spore is simple\r\nand unicellular. In _Lactarius_ and _Russula_ the trama, or inner\r\nsubstance, is vesicular. True latex vessels occur occasionally in\r\n_Agaricus_, though not filled with milk as in _Lactarius_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--_Polyporus giganteus_ (reduced).]\r\n\r\nPOLYPOREI.--In this order the gill plates are replaced by tubes or\r\npores, the interior of which is lined by the hymenium; indications\r\nof this structure having already been exhibited in some of the\r\nlower _Agaricini._ In many cases the stem is suppressed. The\r\nsubstance is fleshy in _Boletus_, but in _Polyporus_ the greater\r\nnumber of species are leathery or corky, and more persistent. The\r\nbasidia, spicules, and quaternate spores agree with those of\r\n_Agaricini_.[L] In fact there are no features of importance which\r\nrelate to the hymenium in any order of _Hymenomycetes_ (the\r\n_Tremellini_ excepted) differing from the same organ in _Agaricini_,\r\nunless it be the absence of _cystidia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Hydnum repandum._]\r\n\r\nHYDNEI.--Instead of pores, in this order the hymenium is spread over\r\nthe surface of spines, prickles, or warts.[M]\r\n\r\nAURICULARINI.--The hymenium is more or less even, and in--\r\n\r\nCLAVARIEI the whole fungus is club-shaped, or more or less intricately\r\nbranched, with the hymenium covering the outer surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--_Calocera viscosa._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--_Tremella mesenterica._]\r\n\r\nTREMELLINI.--In this order we have a great departure from the\r\ncharacter of the substance, external appearance, and internal\r\nstructure of the other orders in this family. Here we have a\r\ngelatinous substance, and the form is lobed, folded, convolute, often\r\nresembling the brain of some animal. The internal structure has been\r\nspecially illustrated by M. Tulasne,[N] through the common species,\r\n_Tremella mesenterica_. This latter is of a fine golden yellow colour,\r\nand rather large size. It is uniformly composed throughout of a\r\ncolourless mucilage, with no appreciable texture, in which are\r\ndistributed very fine, diversely branched and anastomosing filaments.\r\nTowards the surface, the ultimate branches of this filamentous network\r\ngive birth, both at their summits and laterally, to globular cells,\r\nwhich acquire a comparatively large size. These cells are filled with\r\na protoplasm, to which the plant owes its orange colour. When they\r\nhave attained their normal dimensions, they elongate at the summit\r\ninto two, three, or four distinct, thick, obtuse tubes, into which the\r\nprotoplasm gradually passes. The development of these tubes is unequal\r\nand not simultaneous, so that one will often attain its full\r\ndimensions, equal, perhaps, to three or four times the diameter of the\r\ngenerative cell, whilst the others are only just appearing. By\r\ndegrees, as each tube attains its full size, it is attenuated into a\r\nfine point, the extremity of which swells into a spheroidal cell,\r\nwhich ultimately becomes a spore. Sometimes these tubes, or spicules,\r\nsend out one or two lateral branches, each terminated by a spore.\r\nThese spores (about ·006 to ·008 _mm._ diameter) are smooth, and\r\ndeposit themselves, like a fine white dust, on the surface of the\r\n_Tremella_ and on its matrix. M. Léveillé[O] was of opinion that the\r\nbasidia of the Tremellini were monosporous, whilst M. Tulasne has\r\ndemonstrated that they are habitually tetrasporous, as in other of the\r\nHymenomycetes. Although agreeing in this, they differ in other\r\nfeatures, especially in the globose form of the basidia, mode of\r\nproduction of the spicules, and, finally, the division of the basidia\r\ninto two, three, or four cells by septa which cut each other in their\r\naxis. This division precedes the growth of the spicules. It is not\r\nrare to see these cells, formed at the expense of an unilocular\r\nbasidium, become partly isolated from each other; in certain cases\r\nthey seem to have separated very early, they then become larger than\r\nusual, and are grouped on the same filament so as to represent a kind\r\nof buds. This phenomenon usually takes place below the level of the\r\nfertile cells, at a certain depth in the mucous tissue of the\r\n_Tremella_.\r\n\r\nBesides the reproductive system here described, Tulasne also made\r\nknown the existence of a series of filaments which produce spermatia.\r\nThese filaments are often scattered and confused with those which\r\nproduce the basidia, and not distinguishable from them in size or any\r\nother apparent characteristic, except the manner in which their\r\nextremities are branched in order to produce the spermatia. At other\r\ntimes the spermatia-bearing surface covers exclusively certain\r\nportions of the fungus, especially the inferior lobes, imparting\r\nthereto a very bright orange colour, which is communicated by the\r\nlayer of spermatia, unmixed with spores. These spots retain their\r\nbright colour, while the remainder of the plant becomes pale, or\r\ncovered with a white dust. The spermatia are very small, spherical,\r\nand smooth, scarcely equalling ·002 _mm._ They are sessile, sometimes\r\nsolitary, sometimes three or four together, on the slightly swollen\r\nextremities of certain filaments of the weft of the fungus.[P] Tulasne\r\nfound it impossible to make these corpuscles germinate, and in all\r\nessential particulars they agreed with the spermatia found in\r\nascomycetous fungi.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Dacrymyces_, the same observer found the structure to\r\nhave great affinity with that of _Tremella_. The spores in the species\r\nexamined were of a different form, being oblong, very obtuse, slightly\r\ncurved (·013 - ·019 × ·004 - ·006 _mm._), at first unilocular, but\r\nafterwards triseptate. The basidia are cylindrical or clavate, filled\r\nwith coloured granular matter; each of these bifurcates at the summit,\r\nand gradually elongates into two very open branches, which are\r\nattenuated above, and ultimately each is crowned by a spore. There are\r\nto be found also in the species of this genus globose bodies,\r\ndesignated \"sporidioles\" by M. Léveillé, which Tulasne took\r\nconsiderable care to trace to their source. He thus accounts for\r\nthem:--Each of the cells of the spore emits exteriorly one or several\r\nof these corpuscles, supported on very short and very slender\r\npedicels, which remain after the corpuscles are detached from them,\r\nnew corpuscles succeeding the first as long as there remains any\r\nplastic matter within the spore. The pedicels are not all on the same\r\nplane; they are often implanted all on the same, and oftenest on the\r\nconvex side of the reproductive body. These corpuscles, though placed\r\nunder the most favourable conditions, never gave the least sign of\r\nvegetation, and Tulasne concludes that they are spermatia, analogous\r\nto those produced in _Tremella_. The spores which produce spermatia\r\nare not at all apt to germinate, whilst those which did not produce\r\nspermatia germinated freely. Hence it would appear that, although all\r\nspores seem to be perfectly identical, they have not all the same\r\nfunction. The same observer detected also amongst specimens of the\r\n_Dacrymyces_ some of a darker and reddish tint, always bare of spores\r\nor spermatia on the surface, and these presented a somewhat different\r\nstructure. Where the tissue had turned red it was sterile, the\r\nconstituent filaments, ordinarily colourless, and almost empty of\r\nsolid matter, were filled with a highly-coloured protoplasm; they were\r\nof less tenuity, more irregularly thick, and instead of only rarely\r\npresenting partitions, and remaining continuous, as in other parts of\r\nthe plant, were parcelled out into an infinity of straight or curved\r\npieces, angular and of irregular form, especially towards the surface\r\nof the fungus, where they compose a sort of pulp, varying in cohesion\r\naccording to the dry or moist condition of the atmosphere. All parts\r\nof these reddish individuals seemed more or less infected with this\r\ndisintegration, the basidia divided by transverse diaphragms into\r\nseveral cylindrical or oblong pieces, which finally become free.\r\nTransitional conditions were also observed in mixed individuals. This\r\nsterile condition is called by Tulasne \"gemmiparous,\" and he believes\r\nthat it has ere now given origin to one or more spurious species, and\r\nmisled mycologists as to the real structure of perfect and fruitful\r\n_Dacrymyces_.\r\n\r\nPHALLOIDEI.--In this order the hymenium is at first enclosed within a\r\nsort of peridium or universal volva, maintaining a somewhat globose or\r\negg-shape. This envelope consists of an outer and inner coat of\r\nsomewhat similar texture, and an intermediate gelatinous layer, often\r\nof considerable thickness. When a section is made of the fungus,\r\nwhilst still enclosed in the volva, the hymenium is found to present\r\nnumerous cavities, in which basidia are developed, each surmounted by\r\nspicules (four to six) bearing oval or oblong spores.[Q] It is very\r\ndifficult to observe the structure of the hymenium in this order, on\r\naccount of its deliquescent nature. As the hymenium approaches\r\nmaturity, the volva is ruptured, and the plant rapidly enlarges. In\r\n_Phallus_, a long erect cellular stem bears the cap, over which the\r\nhymenium is spread, and this expands enormously after escaping the\r\nrestraint of the volva. Soon after exposure, the hymenium deliquesces\r\ninto a dark mucilage, coloured by the minute spores, which drips from\r\nthe pileus, often diffusing a most loathsome odour for a considerable\r\ndistance. In _Clathrus_, the receptacle forms a kind of network. In\r\n_Aseröe_, the pileus is beautifully stellate. In many the attractive\r\nforms would be considered objects of beauty, were it not for their\r\ndeliquescence, and often foetid odour.[R]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Basidia and spores of _Phallus_.]\r\n\r\nPODAXINEI.--This is a small but very curious group of fungi, in which\r\nthe peridium resembles a volva, which is more or less confluent with\r\nthe surface of the pileus. They assume hymenomycetal forms, some of\r\nthem looking like Agarics, Boleti, or species of _Hydnum_, with\r\ndeformed gills, pores, or spines; in _Montagnites_, in fact, the gill\r\nstructure is very distinct. The spores are borne in definite clusters\r\non short pedicels in such of the genera as have been examined.[S]\r\n\r\nHYPOGÆI.--These are subterranean puff-balls, in which sometimes a\r\ndistinct peridium is present; but in most cases it consists entirely\r\nof an external series of cells, continuous with the internal\r\nstructure, and cannot be correctly estimated as a peridium. The\r\nhymenium is sinuous and convolute, bearing basidia with sterigmata and\r\nspores in the cavities. Sometimes the cavities are traversed by\r\nthreads, as in the _Myxogastres_. The spores are in many instances\r\nbeautifully echinulate, sometimes globose, at others elongated, and\r\nproduced in such numbers as to lead to the belief that their\r\ndevelopment is successive on the spicules. When fully matured, the\r\nperidia are filled with a dusty mass of spores, so that it is scarcely\r\npossible in this condition to gain any notion of the structure. This\r\nis, indeed, the case with nearly all _Gasteromycetes_. The hypogæous\r\nfungi are curiously connected with _Phalloidei_ by the genus\r\n_Hysterangium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Basidia and spores of _Lycoperdon_.]\r\n\r\nTRICHOGASTRES.[T]--In their early stages the species contained in\r\nthis group are not gelatinous, as in the _Myxogastres_, but are\r\nrather fleshy and firm. Very little has been added to our knowledge\r\nof structure in this group since 1839 and 1842, when one of us\r\nwrote to the following effect:--If a young plant of _Lycoperdon\r\ncoelatum_ or _L. gemmatum_ be cut through and examined with a common\r\npocket lens, it will be found to consist of a fleshy mass,\r\nperforated in every direction with minute elongated, reticulated,\r\nanastomosing, labyrinthiform cavities. The resemblance of these to the\r\ntubes of _Boleti_ in an early stage of growth, first led me to\r\nsuspect that there must be some very close connection between them.\r\nIf a very thin slice now be taken, while the mass is yet firm, and\r\nbefore there is the slightest indication of a change of colour, the\r\nouter stratum of the walls of these cavities is found to consist of\r\npellucid obtuse cells, placed parallel to each other like the pile\r\nof velvet, exactly as in the young hymenium of an Agaric or\r\nBoletus. Occasionally one or two filaments cross from one wall to\r\nanother, and once I have seen these anastomose. At a more advanced\r\nstage of growth, four little spicules are developed at the tips of\r\nthe sporophores, all of which, as far as I have been able to observe,\r\nare fertile and of equal height, and on each of these spicules a\r\nglobose spore is seated. It is clear that we have here a structure\r\nidentical with that of the true Hymenomycetes, a circumstance which\r\naccords well with the fleshy habit and mode of growth. There is some\r\ndifficulty in ascertaining the exact structure of the species just\r\nnoticed, as the fruit-bearing cells, or sporophores, are very\r\nsmall, and when the spicules are developed the substance becomes so\r\nflaccid that it is difficult to cut a proper slice, even with the\r\nsharpest lancet. I have, however, satisfied myself as to the true\r\nstructure by repeated observations. But should any difficulty arise\r\nin verifying it in the species in question, there will be none in\r\ndoing so in _Lycoperdon giganteum_. In this species the fructifying\r\nmass consists of the same sinuous cavities, which are, however,\r\nsmaller, so that the substance is more compact, and I have not seen\r\nthem traversed by any filaments. In an early stage of growth, the\r\nsurface of the hymenium, that is of the walls of the cavities,\r\nconsists of short threads composed of two or three articulations,\r\nwhich are slightly constricted at the joints, from which, especially\r\nfrom the last, spring short branchlets, often consisting of a\r\nsingle cell. Sometimes two or more branchlets spring from the same\r\npoint. Occasionally the threads are constricted without any\r\ndissepiments, the terminal articulations are obtuse, and soon swell\r\nvery much, so as greatly to exceed in diameter those on which they\r\nare seated. When arrived at their full growth, they are somewhat\r\nobovate, and produce four spicules, which at length are surmounted\r\neach with a globose spore. When the spores are fully developed, the\r\nsporophores wither, and if a solution of iodine be applied, which\r\nchanges the spores to a rich brown, they will be seen still adhering\r\nby their spicules to the faded sporophores. The spores soon become\r\nfree, but the spicule often still adheres to them; but they are not\r\nattached to the intermingled filaments. In _Bovista plumbea_, the\r\nspores have very long peduncles.[U] As in the _Hymenomycetes_, the\r\nprevailing type of reproductive organs consisted of quaternary\r\nspores borne on spicules; so in _Gasteromycetes_, the prevailing\r\ntype, in so far as it is yet known, is very similar, in some cases\r\nnearly identical, consisting of a definite number of minute spores\r\nborne on spicules seated on basidia. In a very large number of\r\ngenera, the minute structure and development of the fructification\r\n(beyond the mature spores) is almost unknown, but from analogy it\r\nmay be concluded that a method prevails in a large group like the\r\n_Myxogastres_ which does not differ in essential particulars from that\r\nwhich is known to exist in other groups. The difficulties in the way\r\nof studying the development of the spores in this are far greater\r\nthan in the previous order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--_a._ Threads of _Trichia_. _b._ Portion further\r\nmagnified, with spores. _c._ Portion of spinulose thread.]\r\n\r\nMYXOGASTRES.--At one time that celebrated mycologist, Professor De\r\nBary, seemed disposed to exclude this group from the vegetable kingdom\r\naltogether, and relegate them to a companionship with amoeboid forms.\r\nBut in more recent works he seems to have reconsidered, and almost, if\r\nnot entirely, abandoned, that disposition. These fungi, mostly minute,\r\nare characterized in their early stages by their gelatinous nature.\r\nThe substance of which they are then composed bears considerable\r\nresemblance to sarcode, and, did they never change from this, there\r\nmight be some excuse for doubting as to their vegetable nature; but as\r\nthe species proceed towards maturity they lose their mucilaginous\r\ntexture, and become a mass of spores, intermixed with threads,\r\nsurrounded by a cellular peridium. Take, for instance, the genus\r\n_Trichia_, and we have in the matured specimens a somewhat globose\r\nperidium, not larger than a mustard seed, and sometimes nearly of the\r\nsame colour; this ultimately ruptures and exposes a mass of minute\r\nyellow spherical spores, intermixed with threads of the same\r\ncolour.[V] These threads, when highly magnified, exhibit in themselves\r\na spiral arrangement, which has been the basis of some controversy,\r\nand in some species these threads are externally spinulose. The chief\r\ncontroversy on these threads has been whether the spiral markings are\r\nexternal or internal, whether caused by twisting of the thread or by\r\nthe presence of an external or internal fibre. The spiral appearance\r\nhas never been called in question, only the structure from whence it\r\narises, and this, like the striæ of diatoms, is very much an open\r\nquestion. Mr. Currey held that the spiral appearance may be accounted\r\nfor by supposing the existence of an accurate elevation in the wall of\r\nthe cell, following a spiral direction from one end of the thread to\r\nthe other. This supposition would, he thinks, accord well with the\r\noptical appearances, and it would account exactly for the undulations\r\nof outline to which he alludes. He states that he had in his\r\npossession a thread of _Trichia chrysosperma_, in which the spiral\r\nappearance was so manifestly caused by an elevation of this nature, in\r\nwhich it is so clear that no internal spiral fibre exists, that he did\r\nnot think there could be a doubt in the mind of any person carefully\r\nexamining it with a power of 500 diameters that the cause of the\r\nspiral appearance was not a spiral fibre. In _Arcyria_, threads of a\r\ndifferent kind are present; they mostly branch and anastomose, and are\r\nexternally furnished with prominent warts or spines, which Mr.\r\nCurrey[W] holds are also arranged in a spiral manner around the\r\nthreads. In other Myxogastres, threads are also present without any\r\nappreciable spiral markings or spines. In the mature condition of\r\nthese fungi, they so clearly resemble, and have such close affinities\r\nwith, the Trichogastres that one is led almost to doubt whether it was\r\nnot on hasty grounds, without due examination or consideration, that\r\nproposals were made to remove them from the society of their kindred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Arcyria incarnata_, with portion of threads and\r\nspore, magnified.]\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the development of the spores in this group;\r\nin the early stages the whole substance is so pulpy, and in the latter\r\nso dusty, whilst the transition from one to the other is so rapid,\r\nthat the relation between the spores and threads, and their mode of\r\nattachment, has never been definitely made out. It has been supposed\r\nthat the spinulose projections from the capillitium in some species\r\nare the remains of pedicels from which, the spores have fallen, but\r\nthere is no evidence beyond this supposition in its favour, whilst on\r\nthe other hand, in _Stemonitis_, for instance, there is a profuse\r\ninterlacing capillitium, and no spines have been detected. In order to\r\nstrengthen the supposition, spines should be more commonly present.\r\nThe threads, or capillitium, form a beautiful reticulated network in\r\n_Stemonitis_, _Cribraria_, _Diachæa_, _Dictydium_, &c. In _Spumaria_,\r\n_Reticularia_, _Lycogala_, &c., they are almost obsolete.[X] In no\r\ngroup is the examination of the development of structure more\r\ndifficult, for the reasons already alleged, than in the Myxogastres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Diachæa elegans._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--_Cyathus vernicosus._]\r\n\r\nNIDULARIACEI.--This small group departs in some important particulars\r\nfrom the general type of structure present in the rest of the\r\nGasteromycetes.[Y] The plants here included may be described under\r\nthree parts, the mycelium, the peridium, and the sporangia. The\r\nmycelium is often plentiful, stout, rigid, interlacing, and coloured,\r\nrunning over the surface of the soil, or amongst the vegetable débris\r\non which the fungi establish themselves. The peridia are seated upon\r\nthis mycelium, and in most instances are at length open above, taking\r\nthe form of cups, or beakers. These organs consist of three strata of\r\ntissue varying in structure, the external being fibrous, and sometimes\r\nhairy, the interior cellular and delicate, the intermediate thick and\r\nat length tough, coriaceous, and resistant. When first formed, the\r\nperidia are spherical, they then elongate and expand, the mouth being\r\nfor some time closed by a veil, or diaphragm, which ultimately\r\ndisappears. Within the cups lentil-shaped bodies are attached to the\r\nbase and sides by elastic cords. These are the sporangia. Each of\r\nthese has a complicated structure; externally there is a filamentous\r\ntunic, composed of interlaced fibres, sometimes called the peridiole;\r\nbeneath this is the cortex, of compact homogenous structure, then\r\nfollows a cellular thicker stratum, bearing, towards the centre of the\r\nsporangia, delicate branched threads, or sporophores, on which, at\r\ntheir extremities, the ovate spores are generated, sometimes in pairs,\r\nbut normally, it would seem that they are quaternary on spicules, the\r\nthreads being true basidia. The whole structure is exceedingly\r\ninteresting and peculiar, and may be studied in detail in Tulasne's\r\nmemoir on this group.\r\n\r\nSPHÆRONEMEI.--In this very large and, within certain limits, variable\r\norder, there is but little of interest as regards structure, which is\r\nnot better illustrated elsewhere; as, for instance, some sort of\r\nperithecium is always present, but this can be better studied in the\r\n_Sphæriacei_. The spores are mostly very minute, borne on delicate\r\nsporophores, which originate from the inner surface of the perithecia,\r\nbut the majority of so-called species are undoubtedly conditions of\r\nsphæriaceous fungi, either spermatogonia or pycnidia, and are of much\r\nmore interest when studied in connection with the higher forms to\r\nwhich they belong.[Z] Probably the number of complete and autonomous\r\nspecies are very few.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--_Cyathus._ _a._ Sporangium. _b._ Section. _c._\r\nSporophore. _d._ Spores.]\r\n\r\nMELANCONIEI.--Here, again, are associated together a great number of\r\nwhat formerly were considered good species of fungi, but which are\r\nnow known to be but conditions of other forms. One great point of\r\ndistinction between these and the preceding is the absence of any\r\ntrue perithecium, the spores being produced in a kind of spurious\r\nreceptacle, or from a sort of stroma. The spores are, as a rule,\r\nlarger and much more attractive than in _Sphæronemei_, and, in\r\nsome instances, are either very fine, or very curious. Under this\r\nhead we may mention the multiseptate spores of _Coryneum_; the\r\ntri-radiate spores of _Asterosporium_; the curious crested spores of\r\n_Pestalozzia_; the doubly crested spores of _Dilophospora_; and the\r\nscarcely less singular gelatinous coated spores of _Cheirospora_.\r\nIn all cases the fructification is abundant, and the spores frequently\r\nooze out in tendrils, or form a black mass above the spurious\r\nreceptacle from which they issue.[a]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--_Asterosporium Hoffmanni._]\r\n\r\nTORULACEI.--In this order there seems at first to be a considerable\r\nresemblance to the _Dematiei_, except that the threads are almost\r\nobsolete, and the plant is reduced to chains of spores, without trace\r\nof perithecium, investing cuticle, or definite stroma. Sometimes the\r\nspores are simple, in other cases septate, and in _Sporochisma_ are at\r\nfirst produced in an investing cell. In most cases simple threads at\r\nlength become septate, and are ultimately differentiated into spores,\r\nwhich separate at the joints when fully mature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Barren Cysts and Pseudospores of _Lecythea_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--_Coleosporium Tussilaginis_, Lev.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--_Melampsora salicina._]\r\n\r\nCÆOMACEI.--Of far greater interest are the Coniomycetous parasites\r\non living plants. The present order includes those in which the\r\nspore[b] is reduced to a single cell; and here we may observe that,\r\nalthough many of them are now proved to be imperfect in themselves,\r\nand only forms or conditions of other fungals, we shall write of them\r\nhere without regard to their duality. These originate, for the most\r\npart, within the tissues of living plants, and are developed outwards\r\nin pustules, which burst through the cuticle. The mycelium penetrates\r\nthe intercellular passages, and may sometimes be found in parts\r\nof the plants where the fungus does not develop itself. There is no\r\nproper excipulum or peridium, and the spores spring direct from a\r\nmore compacted portion of the mycelium, or from a cushion-like\r\nstroma of small cells. In _Lecythea_, the sub-globose spores are at\r\nfirst generated at the tips of short pedicels, from which they are\r\nultimately separated; surrounding these spores arise a series of\r\nbarren cells, or cysts, which are considerably larger the true spores,\r\nand colourless, while the spores are of some shade of yellow or\r\norange.[c] In _Trichobasis_, the spores are of a similar character,\r\nsub-globose, and at first pedicellate; but there are no surrounding\r\ncysts, and the colour is more usually brown, although sometimes\r\nyellow. In _Uredo_, the spores are at first generated singly, within\r\na mother cell; they are globose, and either yellow or brown, without\r\nany pedicel. In _Coleosporium_, there are two kinds of spores,\r\nthose of a pulverulent nature, globose, which are sometimes produced\r\nalone at the commencement of the season, and others which originate\r\nas an elongated cell; this becomes septate, and ultimately separates\r\nat the joints. During the greater part of the year, both kinds of\r\nspores are to be found in the same pustule. In _Melampsora_, the\r\nwinter spores are elongated and wedge-shaped, compacted together\r\nclosely, and are only matured during winter on dead leaves; the summer\r\nspores are pulverulent and globose, being, in fact, what were until\r\nrecently regarded as species of _Lecythea_. In _Cystopus_, the spores\r\nare sub-globose, or somewhat angular, generated in a moniliform\r\nmanner, and afterwards separating at the joints. The upper spore is\r\nalways the oldest, continuous production of spores going on for some\r\ntime at the base of the chain. Under favourable conditions of\r\nmoisture, each of these spores, or conidia, as De Bary terms them, is\r\ncapable of producing within itself a number of zoospores;[d] these\r\nultimately burst the vesicle, move about by the aid of vibratile\r\ncilia, and at last settle down to germinate. Besides these, other\r\nreproductive bodies are generated upon the mycelium, within the\r\ntissues of the plant, in the form of globose oogonia, or resting\r\nspores, which, when mature, also enclose great numbers of zoospores.\r\nSimilar oogonia are produced amongst the _Mucedines_ in the genus\r\n_Peronospora_, to which De Bary considers _Cystopus_ to be closely\r\nallied. At all events, this is a peculiarity of structure and\r\ndevelopment not as yet met with in any other of the _Cæomacei_. In\r\n_Uromyces_ is the nearest approach to the _Pucciniæi_; in fact, it is\r\n_Puccinia_ reduced to a single cell. The form of spore is usually\r\nmore angular and irregular than in _Trichobasis_, and the pedicel is\r\npermanent. It may be remarked here, that of the foregoing genera,\r\nmany of the species are not autonomous that have hitherto been\r\nincluded amongst them. This is especially true of _Lecythea_,\r\n_Trichobasis_, and, as it now appears, of _Uromyces_.[e]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--_Cystopus candidus._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--_Xenodochus carbonarius._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--_Phragmidium bulbosum._]\r\n\r\nPUCCINIÆI.--This group differs from the foregoing chiefly in having\r\nseptate spores. The pustules, or sori, break through the cuticle in a\r\nsimilar manner, and here also no true peridium is present. In\r\n_Xenodochus_, the highest development of joints is reached, each\r\nspore being composed of an indefinite number, from ten to twenty\r\ncells. With it is associated an unicellular yellow Uredine, of which\r\nit is a condition. Probably, in every species of the _Pucciniæi_, it\r\nmay hereafter be proved, as it is now suspected, that an unicellular\r\nUredine precedes or is associated with it, forming a condition, or\r\nsecondary form of fruit of that species. Many instances of that kind\r\nhave already been traced by De Bary,[f] Tulasne, and others, and some\r\nhave been a little too rashly surmised by their followers. In\r\n_Phragmidium_, the pedicel is much more elongated than in _Xenodochus_,\r\nand the spore is shorter, with fewer and a more definite number of\r\ncells for each species; Mr. Currey is of opinion that each cell of\r\nthe spore in _Phragmidium_ has an inner globose cell, which he caused\r\nto escape by rupture of the outer cell wall as a sphæroid nucleus,[g]\r\nleading to the inference that each cell has its own individual power\r\nof germination and reproduction. In _Triphragmium_, there are three\r\ncells for each spore, two being placed side by side, and one\r\nsuperimposed. In one species, however, _Triphragmium deglubens_\r\n(North American), the cells are arranged as in _Phragmidium_, so that\r\nthis represents really a tricellular _Phragmidium_, linking the present\r\nwith the latter genus. In _Puccinia_ the number of species is by far the\r\nmost numerous; in this genus the spores are uniseptate, and, as in\r\nall the _Pucciniæi_, the peduncles are permanent. There is great\r\nvariability in the compactness of the spores in the sori, or pulvinules.\r\nIn some species, the sori are so pulverulent that the spores are as\r\nreadily dispersed as in the Uredines, in others they are so compact as\r\nto be separated from each other with great difficulty. As might be\r\nanticipated, this has considerable effect on the contour of the spores,\r\nwhich in pulverulent species are shorter, broader, and more ovate than\r\nin the compact species. If a section of one of the more compact sori be\r\nmade, it will be seen that the majority of the spores are side by side,\r\nnearly at the same level, their apices forming the external surface\r\nof the sori, but it will not be unusual to observe smaller and\r\nyounger spores pushing up from the hymenial cells, between the\r\npeduncles of the elder spores, leading to the inference that there is a\r\nsuccession of spores produced in the same pulvinule. In _Podisoma_, a\r\nrather anomalous genus, the septate spores are immersed in a\r\ngelatinous stratum, and some authors have imagined that they have an\r\naffinity with the Tremellini, but this affinity is more apparent than\r\nreal. The phenomena of germination, and their relations to _Roestelia_,\r\nif substantiated, establish their claim to a position amongst the\r\n_Pucciniæi_.[h] It seems to us that _Gymnosporangium_ does not differ\r\ngenerically from _Podisoma_. In a recently-characterized species,\r\n_Podisoma Ellisii_, the spores are bi-triseptate. This is, moreover,\r\npeculiar from the great deficiency in the gelatinous element. In\r\nanother North American species, called _Gymnosporangium biseptatum_,\r\nEllis, which is distinctly gelatinous, there are similar biseptate\r\nspores, but they are considerably broader and more obtuse. In other\r\ndescribed species they are uniseptate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Pseudospores of _Puccinia_.]\r\n\r\nUSTILAGINEI.--These fungi are now usually treated as distinct from the\r\n_Cæomacei_, to which they are closely related.[i] They are also\r\nparasitic on growing plants, but the spores are usually black or\r\nsooty, and never yellow or orange; on an average much smaller than in\r\nthe _Cæomacei_. In _Tilletia_, the spores are spherical and\r\nreticulated, mixed with delicate threads, from whence they spring. In\r\nthe best known species, _Tilletia caries_, they constitute the \"bunt\"\r\nof wheat. The peculiarities of germination will be alluded to\r\nhereafter. In _Ustilago_, the minute sooty spores are developed either\r\non delicate threads or in compacted cells, arising first from a sort\r\nof semi-gelatinous, grumous stroma. It is very difficult to detect any\r\nthreads associated with the spores. The species attack the flowers and\r\nanthers of composite and polygonaceous plants, the leaves, culms, and\r\ngermen of grasses, &c., and are popularly known as \"smuts.\" In\r\n_Urocystis_ and _Thecaphora_, the spores are united together into\r\nsub-globose bodies, forming a kind of compound spore. In some species\r\nof _Urocystis_, the union which subsists between them is comparatively\r\nslight. In _Thecaphora_, on the contrary, the complex spore, or\r\nagglomeration of spores, is compact, being at first apparently\r\nenclosed in a delicate cyst. In _Tuburcinia_, the minute cells are\r\ncompacted into a hollow sphere, having lacunæ communicating with the\r\ninterior, and often exhibiting the remains of a pedicel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--_Thecaphora hyalina._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--_Æcidium Berberidis._]\r\n\r\nÆCIDIACEI.--This group differs from the foregoing three groups\r\nprominently in the presence of a cellular peridium, which encloses\r\nthe spores; hence some mycologists have not hesitated to propose\r\ntheir association with the Gasteromycetes, although every other\r\nfeature in their structure seems to indicate a close affinity\r\nwith the _Cæomacei_. The pretty cups in the genus _Æcidium_ are\r\nsometimes scattered and sometimes collected in clusters, either with\r\nspermogonia in the centre or on the opposite surface. The cups\r\nare usually white, composed of regularly arranged bordered cells\r\nat length bursting at the apex, with the margins turned back and\r\nsplit into radiating teeth. The spores are commonly of a bright\r\norange or golden yellow, sometimes white or brownish, and are\r\nproduced in chains, or moniliform strings, slightly attached to\r\neach other,[j] and breaking off at the summit at the same time that\r\nthey continue to be produced at the base, so that for some time\r\nthere is a successive production of spores. The spermogonia are\r\nnot always readily detected, as they are much smaller than the\r\nperidia, and sometimes precede them. The spermatia are expelled\r\nfrom the lacerated and fringed apices, and are very minute and\r\ncolourless. In _Roestelia_ the peridia are large, growing in\r\ncompany, and splitting longitudinally in many cases, or by a\r\nlacerated mouth. In most instances, the spores are brownish, but\r\nin a splendid species from North America (_Roestelia aurantiaca_,\r\nPeck), recently characterized, they are of a bright orange. If\r\nOersted is correct in his observations, which await confirmation,\r\nthese species are all related to species of _Podisoma_ as a\r\nsecondary form of fruit.[k] In the _Roestelia_ of the pear-tree, as\r\nwell as in that of the mountain ash, the spermogonia will be found\r\neither in separate tufts on discoloured spots, or associated with\r\nthe _Roestelia_, In _Peridermium_ there is very little structural\r\ndifference from _Roestelia_, and the species are all found on\r\nconiferous trees. In _Endophyllum_, the peridia are immersed in the\r\nsucculent substance of the matrix; whilst in _Graphiola_, there is\r\na tougher and withal double peridium, the inner of which forms a\r\ntuft of erect threads resembling a small brush.[l]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--_Helminthosporium molle._]\r\n\r\nHYPHOMYCETES.--The predominant feature in the structure of this order\r\nhas already been intimated to consist in the development of the\r\nvegetative system under the form of simple or branched threads, on\r\nwhich the fruit is generated. The common name of mould is applied to\r\nthem perhaps more generally than to other groups, although the term is\r\ntoo vague, and has been too vaguely applied to be of much service in\r\ngiving an idea of the characteristics of this order. Leaving the\r\nsmaller groups, and confining ourselves to the _Dematiei_ and the\r\n_Mucedines_, we shall obtain some notion of the prevalent structure.\r\nIn the former the threads are more or less carbonized, in the latter\r\nnearly colourless. One of the largest genera in _Dematiei_ is\r\n_Helminthosporium_. It appears on decaying herbaceous plants, and on\r\nold wood, forming effused black velvety patches. The mycelium, of\r\ncoloured jointed threads, overlays and penetrates the matrix; from\r\nthis arise erect, rigid, and usually jointed threads, of a dark brown,\r\nnearly black colour at the base, but paler towards the apex. In most\r\ncases these threads have an externally cortical layer, which imparts\r\nrigidity; usually from the apex, but sometimes laterally, the spores\r\nare produced. Although sometimes colourless, these are most commonly\r\nof some shade of brown, more or less elongated, and divided\r\ntransversely by few or many septa. In _Helminthosporium Smithii_, the\r\nspores much exceed the dimensions of the threads;[m] in other species\r\nthey are smaller. In _Dendryphium_, the threads and spores are very\r\nsimilar, except that the threads are branched at their apex, and the\r\nspores are often produced one at the end of another in a short\r\nchain.[n] In _Septosporium_ again, the threads and spores are similar,\r\nbut the spores are pedicellate, and attached at or near the base;\r\nwhilst in _Acrothecium_, with similar threads and spores, the latter\r\nare clustered together at the apex of the threads. In _Triposporium_,\r\nthe threads are similar, but the spores are tri-radiate; and in\r\n_Helicoma_, the spores are twisted spirally. Thus, we might pass\r\nthrough all the genera to illustrate this chief feature of coloured,\r\nseptate, rather rigid, and mostly erect threads, bearing at some point\r\nspores, which in most instances are elongated, coloured, and septate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--_Acrothecium simplex._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--_Peronospora Arenariæ._]\r\n\r\nMUCEDINES.--Here, on the other hand, the threads, if coloured at all,\r\nare still delicate, more flexuous, with much thinner walls, and never\r\ninvested with an external cortical layer. One of the most important\r\nand highly developed genera is _Peronospora_, the members of which are\r\nparasitic upon and destructive of living vegetables. It is to this\r\ngenus that the mould of the too famous potato disease belongs.\r\nProfessor De Bary has done more than any other mycologist in the\r\ninvestigation and elucidation of this genus; and his monograph is a\r\nmasterpiece in its way.[o] He was, however, preceded by Mr. Berkeley,\r\nand more especially by Dr. Montagne, by many years in elucidation of\r\nthe structure of the flocci and conidia in a number of species.[p] In\r\nthis genus, there is a delicate mycelium, which penetrates the\r\nintercellular passages of living plants, giving rise to erect branched\r\nthreads, which bear at the tips of their ultimate ramuli, sub-globose,\r\novate, or elliptic spores, or, as De Bary terms them--conidia. Deeply\r\nseated on the mycelium, within the substance of the foster plant,\r\nother reproductive bodies, called oogonia, originate. These are\r\nspherical, more or less warted and brownish, the contents of which\r\nbecome differentiated into vivacious zoospores, capable, when\r\nexpelled, of moving in water by the aid of vibratile cilia. A similar\r\nstructure has already been indicated in _Cystopus_, otherwise it is\r\nrare in fungi, if the _Saprolegniei_ be excluded. In _Botrytis_ and in\r\n_Polyactis_, the flocci and spores are similar, but the branches of\r\nthe threads are shorter and more compact, and the septa are more\r\ncommon and numerous; the oogonia also are absent. De Bary has selected\r\n_Polyactis cinerea_, as it occurs on dead vine leaves, to illustrate\r\nhis views of the dualism which he believes himself to have discovered\r\nin this species. \"It spreads its mycelium in the tissue which is\r\nbecoming brown,\" he writes, \"and this shows at first essentially the\r\nsame construction and growth as that of the mycelium filaments of\r\n_Aspergillus_.\" On the mycelium soon appear, besides those which are\r\nspread over the tissue of the leaves, strong, thick, mostly\r\nfasciculate branches, which stand close to one another, breaking forth\r\nfrom the leaf and rising up perpendicularly, the conidia-bearers. They\r\ngrow about 1 _mm._ long, divide themselves, by successively rising\r\npartitions, into some prominent cylindrical linked cells, and then\r\ntheir growth is ended, and the upper cell produces near its point\r\nthree to six branches almost standing rectangularly. Of these the\r\nunder ones are the longest, and they again shoot forth from under\r\ntheir ends one or more still shorter little branches. The nearer they\r\nare to the top, the shorter are the branches, and less divided; the\r\nupper ones are quite branchless, and their length scarcely exceeds the\r\nbreadth of the principal stem. Thus a system of branches appears, upon\r\nwhich, on a small scale, a bunch of grapes is represented. All the\r\ntwigs soon end their growth; they all separate their inner space from\r\nthe principal stem, by means of a cross partition placed close to it.\r\nAll the ends, and also that of the principal stem, swell about the\r\nsame time something like a bladder, and on the upper free half of each\r\nswelling appear again, simultaneously, several fine protuberances,\r\nclose together, which quickly grow to little oval bladders filled with\r\nprotoplasm, and resting on their bearers with a sub-sessile,\r\npedicellate, narrow basis, and which at length separate themselves\r\nthrough a partition as in _Aspergillus_. The detached cells are the\r\nconidia of our fungus; only one is formed on each stalk. When the\r\nformation is completed in the whole of the panicle, the little\r\nbranches which compose it are deprived of their protoplasm in favour\r\nof the conidia; it is the same with the under end of the principal\r\nstem, the limits of which are marked by a cross partition. The\r\ndelicate wall of these parts shrinks up until it is unrecognizable;\r\nall the conidia of the panicle approach one another to form an\r\nirregular grape-like bunch, which rests loosely on the bearer, and\r\nfrom which it easily falls away as dust. If they be brought into water\r\nthey fall off immediately; only the empty, shrivelled, delicate skins\r\nare to be found on the branch which bore them, and the places on which\r\nthey are fixed to the principal stem clearly appear as round\r\ncircumscribed hilums, generally rather arched towards the exterior.\r\nThe development of the main stem is not ended here. It remains solid\r\nand filled with protoplasm as far as the portion which forms the end\r\nthrough its conidia. Its end, which is to be found among these pieces,\r\nbecomes pointed after the ripening of the first panicle, pushes the\r\nend of the shrivelled member on one side, and grows to the same length\r\nas the height of one or two panicles, and then remains still, to form\r\na second panicle similar to the first. This is later equally\r\nperfoliated as the first, then a third follows, and thus a large\r\nnumber of panicles are produced after and over one another on the same\r\nstem. In perfect specimens, every perfoliated panicle hangs loosely to\r\nits original place on the surface of the stem, until by shaking or the\r\naccess of water to it, it falls immediately into the single conidia,\r\nor the remains of branches, and the already-mentioned oval hilums are\r\nleft behind. Naturally, the stem becomes longer by every perfoliation;\r\nin luxuriant specimens the length can reach that of some lines. Its\r\npartition is already, by the ripening of the first panicle from the\r\nbeginning of its foundation, strong and brown; it is only colourless\r\nat the end which is extending, and in all new formations. During all\r\nthese changes the filament remains either unbranched, except as\r\nregards the transient panicles, or it sends out here and there, at the\r\nperfoliated spots, especially from the lower ones, one or two strong\r\nbranches, standing opposite one another and resembling the principal\r\nstem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--_Polyactis cinerea._ _a._ Apex of hypha.]\r\n\r\nThe mycelium, which grows so exuberantly in the leaf, often brings\r\nforth many other productions, which are called _sclerotia_, and are,\r\naccording to their nature, a thick bulbous tissue of mycelium\r\nfilaments. Their formation begins with the profuse ramification of the\r\nmycelium threads in some place or other; generally, but not always, in\r\nthe veins of the leaf; the intertwining twigs form an uninterrupted\r\ncavity, in which is often enclosed the shrivelling tissue of the leaf.\r\nThe whole body swells to a greater thickness than that of the leaf,\r\nand protrudes on the surface like a thickened spot. Its form varies\r\nfrom circular to fusiform; its size is also very unequal, ranging\r\nbetween a few lines and about half a millimetre in its largest\r\ndiameter. At first it is colourless, but afterwards its outer layers\r\nof cells become round, of a brown or black colour, and it is\r\nsurrounded by a black rind, consisting of round cells, which separate\r\nit from the neighbouring tissue. The tissue within the rind remains\r\ncolourless; it is an entangled uninterrupted tissue of fungus\r\nfilaments, which gradually obtain very solid, hard, cartilaginous\r\ncoats. The sclerotium, which ripens as the rind becomes black, loosens\r\nitself easily from the place of its formation, and remains preserved\r\nafter the latter is decayed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--_Peziza Fuckeliana._ _a._ Natural size. _b._\r\nSection enlarged. _c._ Ascus and sporidia.]\r\n\r\nThe sclerotia are, here as in many other fungi, biennial organs,\r\ndesigned to begin a new vegetation after a state of apparent quietude,\r\nand to send forth special fruit-bearers. They may in this respect be\r\ncompared to the bulbs and perennial roots of under shrubs. The usual\r\ntime for the development of the sclerotia is late in the autumn,\r\nafter the fall of the vine leaves. As long as the frost does not set\r\nin, new ones continually spring up, and each one attains to ripeness\r\nin a few days. If frost appears, it can lie dry a whole year, without\r\nlosing its power of development. This latter commences when the\r\nsclerotium is brought into contact with damp ground during the usual\r\ntemperature of our warmer seasons. If this occur soon, at the latest\r\nsome weeks after it is ripe, new vegetation grows very quickly,\r\ngenerally after a few days; in several parts the colourless filaments\r\nof the inner tissue begin to send out clusters of strong branches,\r\nwhich, breaking through the black rind, stretch themselves up\r\nperpendicularly towards the surface, separate from one another, and\r\nthen take all the characteristics of the conidia-bearers. Many such\r\nclusters can be produced on one sclerotium, so that soon the greater\r\npart of the surface is covered by filamentous conidia-bearers with\r\ntheir panicles. The colourless tissue of the sclerotium disappears in\r\nthe same degree as the conidia-bearers grow, and at last the black\r\nrind remains behind empty and shrivelled. If we bring, after many\r\nmonths, for the first time, the ripe sclerotium, in damp ground, in\r\nsummer or autumn, after it has ripened, the further development takes\r\nplace more slowly, and in an essentially different form. It is true\r\nthat from the inner tissue numerous filamentous branches shoot forth\r\nat the cost of this growing fascicle, and break through the black\r\nrind, but its filaments remain strongly bound, in an almost parallel\r\nsituation, to a cylindrical cord, which for a time lengthens itself\r\nand spreads out its free end to a flat plate-like disc. This is always\r\nformed of strongly united threads, ramifications of the cylindrical\r\ncord. On the free upper surface of the disc, the filaments shoot forth\r\ninnumerable branches, which, growing to the same height, thick and\r\nparallel with one another, cover the before-named disc. Some remain\r\nnarrow and cylindrical, are very numerous, and produce fine hairs\r\n(paraphyses); others, also very numerous, take the form of club-like\r\nampulla cells, and each one forms in its interior eight free swimming\r\noval spores. Those ampulla cells are sporidiiferous asci. After the\r\nspores have become ripe, the free point of the utricle bursts, and the\r\nspores are scattered to a great distance by a mechanism which we will\r\nnot here further describe. New ampullas push themselves between those\r\nwhich are ripening and withering; a disc can, under favourable\r\ncircumstances, always form new asci for weeks at a time. The number of\r\nthe already described utricle-bearers is different, according to the\r\nsize of the sclerotium; smaller specimens usually produce only one,\r\nlarger two to four. The size is regulated by that of the sclerotia,\r\nand ranges, in full-grown specimens, between one and more millimetres\r\nfor the length of the stalk, and a half to three (seldom more)\r\nmillimetres for the breadth of the disc.[q] For some time the conidia\r\nform, belonging to the Mucedines, has been known as _Botrytis cinerea_\r\n(or _Polyactis cinerea_). The compact mycelium, or sclerotium, as an\r\nimperfect fungus, bore the name of _Sclerotium echinatum_, whilst to\r\nthe perfect and cup-like form has been given the name of _Peziza\r\nFuckeliana_. We have reproduced De Bary's life-history of this mould\r\nhere, as an illustration of structure in the _Mucedines_, but\r\nhereafter we shall have to write of similar transformations when\r\ntreating of polymorphism.\r\n\r\nThe form of the threads, and the form and disposition of the spores,\r\nvary according to the genera of which this order is composed. In\r\n_Oidium_ the mostly simple threads break up into joints. Many of the\r\nformer species are now recognized as conditions of _Erysiphe_. In\r\n_Aspergillus_, the threads are simple and erect, with a globose head,\r\naround which are clustered chains of simple spores. In _Penicillium_,\r\nthe lower portion of the threads is simple, but they are shortly\r\nbranched at the apex, the branches being terminated by necklaces of\r\nminute spores. In _Dactylium_, the threads are branched, but the\r\nspores are collected in clusters usually, and are moreover septate. In\r\nother genera similar distinctions prevail. These two groups of black\r\nmoulds and white moulds are the noblest, and contain the largest\r\nnumber of genera and species amongst the _Hyphomycetes_. There is,\r\nhowever, the small group of _Isariacei_, in which the threads are\r\ncompacted, and a semblance of such hymenomycetal forms as _Clavaria_\r\nand _Pterula_ is the result, but it is doubtful if this group contains\r\nmany autonomous species. In another small group, the _Stilbacei_,\r\nthere is a composite character in the head, or receptacle,[r] and in\r\nthe stem when the latter is present. Many of these, again, as\r\n_Tubercularia_, _Volutella_, _Fusarium_, &c., contain doubtful\r\nspecies. In _Sepedoniei_ and _Trichodermacei_, the threads are reduced\r\nto a minimum, and the spores are such a distinctive element that\r\nthrough these groups the _Hyphomycetes_ are linked with the\r\n_Coniomycetes_. These groups, however, are not of sufficient size or\r\nimportance to demand from us, in a work of this character, anything\r\nmore than the passing allusion which we have given to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--_Penicillium chartarum_, Cooke.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider the structure in the Sporidiifera, in which\r\nthe fructifying corpuscles or germs, whether called spores or\r\nsporidia, are generated within certain privileged cysts, usually in\r\ndefinite numbers. In systematic works, these are included under two\r\norders, the _Physomycetes_ and the _Ascomycetes_. The former of these\r\nconsists of cyst-bearing moulds, and from their nearest affinity to\r\nthe foregoing will occupy the first place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--_Mucor mucedo_, with three sporangia. _a._\r\nPortion of frill with sporangiola.]\r\n\r\nPHYSOMYCETES include, especially amongst the _Mucorini_, many most\r\ninteresting and instructive species for study, which even very lately\r\nhave occupied the attention of continental mycologists. Most of these\r\nphenomena are associated more or less with reproduction, and as such\r\nwill have to be adverted to again, but there are points in the\r\nstructure which can best be alluded to here. Again taking Professor de\r\nBary's researches as our guide,[s] we will illustrate this by the\r\ncommon _Mucor mucedo_: If we bring quite fresh horse-dung into a damp\r\nconfined atmosphere, for example, under a bell-glass, there appears on\r\nits surface, after a few days, an immense white mildew. Upright strong\r\nfilaments of the breadth of a hair raise themselves over the surface,\r\neach of them soon shows at its point a round little head, which\r\ngradually becomes black, and a closer examination shows us that in all\r\nprincipal points it perfectly agrees with the sporangia of other\r\nspecies. Each of these white filaments is a sporangia-bearer. They\r\nspring from a mycelium which is spread in the dung, and appear singly\r\nupon it. Certain peculiarities in the form of the sporangium, and the\r\nlittle long cylindrical spores, which, when examined separately, are\r\nquite flat and colourless, are characteristic of the species. If the\r\nlatter be sown in a suitable medium, for example, in a solution of\r\nsugar, they swell, and shoot forth germinating utricles, which quickly\r\ngrow to mycelia, which bear sporangia. This is easily produced on the\r\nmost various organic bodies, and _Mucor mucedo_ is therefore found\r\nspontaneously on every substratum which is capable of nourishing\r\nmildew, but on the above-named the most perfect and exuberant\r\nspecimens are generally to be found. The sporangia-bearers are at\r\nfirst always branchless and without partitions. After the sporangium\r\nis ripe, cross partitions in irregular order and number often appear\r\nin the inner space, and on the upper surface branches of different\r\nnumber and size, each of which forms a sporangium at its point. The\r\nsporangia which are formed later are often very similar, but sometimes\r\nvery different, to those which first appeared, because their partition\r\nis very thick and does not fall to pieces when it is ripe, but\r\nirregularly breaks off, or remains entire, enclosing the spores, and\r\nat last falls to the ground, when the fungus withers. The cross\r\npartition which separates the sporangia from its bearers is in those\r\nwhich are first formed (which are always relatively thicker sporangia)\r\nvery strongly convex, while those which follow later are often\r\nsmaller, and in little weak specimens much less arched, and sometimes\r\nquite straight. After a few days, similar filaments generally show\r\nthemselves on the dung between the sporangia-bearers, which appear to\r\nthe naked eye to be provided with delicate white frills. Where such an\r\none is to be found, two to four rectangular expanding little branches\r\nspring up to the same height round the filament. Each of these, after\r\na short and simple process, branch out into a furcated form; the\r\nfurcations being made in such a manner that the ends of the branch at\r\nlast so stand together that their surface forms a ball. Finally, each\r\nof the ends of a branch swells to a little round sporangium, which is\r\nlimited by a partition (called sporangiolum, to distinguish it from\r\nthe larger ones), in which some, generally four, spores are formed in\r\nthe manner already known. When the sporangiola are alone, they have\r\nsuch a peculiar appearance, with their richly-branched bearers, that\r\nthey can be taken for something quite different to the organs of the\r\n_Mucor mucedo_, and were formerly not considered to belong to it. That\r\nthey really belong to the _Mucor_ is shown by the principal filament\r\nwhich it bears, not always, but very often, ending with a large\r\nsporangium, which is characteristic of the _Mucor mucedo_; it is still\r\nmore evident if we sow the spores of the sporangiolum, for, as it\r\ngerminates, a mycelium is developed, which, near a simple bearer, can\r\nform large sporangia, and those form sporangiola, the first always\r\nconsiderably preponderating in number, and very often exclusively. If\r\nwe examine a large number of specimens, we find every possible middle\r\nform between the simple or less branched sporangia-bearers and the\r\ntypical sporangiola frills; and we arrive at last at the conclusion\r\nsimply to place the latter among the varieties of form which the\r\nsporangia-bearer of the _Mucor mucedo_ shows, like every other typical\r\norganic form within certain limits. On the other hand, propagation\r\norgans, differing from those of the sporangia and their products,\r\nbelong to _Mucor mucedo_, which may be termed conidia. On the dung\r\n(they are rare on any other substance) these appear at the same time,\r\nor generally somewhat later, than the sporangia-bearers, and are not\r\nunlike those to the naked eye. In a more accurate examination, they\r\nappear different; a thicker, partition-less filament rises up and\r\ndivides itself, generally three-forked, at the length of one\r\nmillimetre, into several series of branchlets. The forked branches of\r\nthe last series bear under their points, which are mostly capillary,\r\nshort erect little ramuli, and these, with which the ends of the\r\nprincipal branches articulate on their somewhat broad tops, several\r\nspores and conidia, near one another; about fifteen to twenty are\r\nformed at the end of each little ramulus. The peculiarities and\r\nvariations which so often appear in the ramification need not be\r\ndiscussed here. After the articulation of the conidia, their bearers\r\nsink together by degrees, and are quite destroyed. The ripe conidia\r\nare round like a ball, their surface is scarcely coloured, and almost\r\nwholly smooth. These conidioid forms were at first described as a\r\nseparate species under the name of _Botrytis Jonesii_. How, then, do\r\nthey belong to the _Mucor_?[t] That they appear gregariously is as\r\nlittle proof of an original relation to one another, here as\r\nelsewhere. Attempts to prove that the conidia and sporangia-bearers\r\noriginate on one and the same mycelium filament may possibly hereafter\r\nsucceed. Till now this has not been the case, and he who has ever\r\ntried to disentangle the mass of filaments which exuberantly covers\r\nthe substratum of a _Mucor_ vegetation, which has reached so far as to\r\nform conidia, will not be surprised that all attempts have hitherto\r\nproved abortive. The suspicion of the connection founded on the\r\ngregariously springing up, and external resemblance, is fully\r\njustified, if we sow the conidia in a suitable medium, for example, in\r\na solution of sugar. They here germinate and produce a mycelium which\r\nexactly resembles that of the _Mucor mucedo_, and, above all, they\r\nproduce in profusion the typical sporangia of the same on its bearers.\r\nThe latter are till now alone reproductions of conidia-bearers, and\r\nhave never been observed on mycelia which have grown out of conidia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Small portion of _Botrytis Jonesii_.]\r\n\r\nThese phenomena of development appear in the _Mucor_ when it dwells on\r\na damp substance, which must naturally contain the necessary\r\nnourishment for it, and is exposed to the atmospheric air. Its\r\nmycelium represents at first strong branched utricles without\r\npartitions; the branches are of the higher order, mostly divided into\r\nrich and very fine-pointed ramuli. In old mycelium, and also in the\r\nsporangia-bearers, the contents of which are mostly used for the\r\nformation of spores, and the substratum of which is exhausted for our\r\nfungus, short stationary pieces, filled with protoplasm, are very\r\noften formed into cells through partitions in order to produce spores,\r\nthat is, grow to a new fruitful mycelium. These cells are called\r\ngemmules, brooding cells, and resemble such vegetable buds and sprouts\r\nof foliaceous plants which remain capable of development after the\r\norgans of vegetation are dead, in order to grow, under suitable\r\ncircumstances, to new vegetating plants, as, for example, the bulbs of\r\nonions, &c.\r\n\r\nIf we bring a vegetating mycelium of _Mucor mucedo_ into a medium\r\nwhich contains the necessary nourishment for it, but excluded from the\r\nfree air, the formation of sporangia takes place very sparingly or not\r\nat all, but that of gemmules is very abundant. Single interstitial\r\npieces of the ramuli, or even whole systems of branches, are quite\r\nfilled with a rich greasy protoplasm; the short pieces and ends are\r\nbound by partitions which form particular, often tun-like or globular\r\ncells; the longer ones are changed, through the formation of cross\r\npartitions, into chains of similar cells; the latter often attain by\r\ndegrees strong, thick walls, and their greasy contents often pass into\r\ninnumerable drops of a very regular globular form and of equal size.\r\nSimilar appearances show themselves after the sowing of spores, which\r\nare capable of germinating in the medium already described, from which\r\nthe air is excluded. Either short germinating utricles shoot forth,\r\nwhich soon form themselves into rows of gemmules, or the spores swell\r\nto large round bladders filled with protoplasm, and shoot forth on\r\nvarious parts of their surface innumerable protuberances, which,\r\nfixing themselves with a narrow basis, soon become round vesiculate\r\ncells, and on which the same sprouts which caused their production are\r\nrepeated, formations which remind us of the fungus of fermentation\r\ncalled globular yeast. Among all the known forms of gemmules we find a\r\nvariety which are intermediate, all of which show, when brought into a\r\nnormal condition of development, the same proportion, and the same\r\ngermination, as those we first described.\r\n\r\nWe have detailed rather at length the structure and development of one\r\nof the most common of the Mucors, which will serve as an illustration\r\nof the order. Other distinctions there may be which are of more\r\ninterest as defining the limits of genera, except such as may be\r\nnoticed when we come to write more specially of reproduction.\r\n\r\nASCOMYCETES.--Passing now to the _Ascomycetes_, which are especially\r\nrich in genera and species, we must first, and but superficially,\r\nallude to _Tuberacei_, an order of sporidiiferous fungi of subterranean\r\nhabit, and rather peculiar structure.[u] In this order an external\r\nstratum of cells forms a kind of perithecium, which is more or less\r\ndeveloped in different genera. This encloses the hymenium, which is\r\nsinuous, contorted, and twisted, often forming lacunæ. The hymenium in\r\nsome genera consists of elongated, nearly cylindrical asci, enclosing a\r\ndefinite number of sporidia; in the true truffles and their\r\nimmediate allies, the asci are broad sacs, containing very large and\r\nbeautiful, often coloured, sporidia. These latter have either a\r\nsmooth, warted, spinulose, or lacunose epispore, and, as will be seen\r\nfrom the figures in Tulasne's Monograph,[v] or those in the last\r\nvolume of Corda's great work,[w] are attractive microscopical objects.\r\nIn some cases, it is not difficult to detect paraphyses, but in\r\nothers they would seem to be entirely absent. A comparatively large\r\nnumber have been discovered and recorded in Great Britain,[x] but of\r\nthose none are more suitable for study of general structure than the\r\nordinary truffle of the markets.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the remaining Ascomycetes can be studied under two\r\ngroups, _i.e._, the fleshy Ascomycetes, or, as they have been termed,\r\nthe Discomycetes, and the hard, or carbonaceous Ascomycetes,\r\nsometimes called the Pyrenomycetes. Neither of these names gives an\r\naccurate idea of the distinctions between the two groups, in the\r\nformer of which the discoid form is not universal, and the latter\r\ncontains somewhat fleshy forms. But in the Discomycetes the\r\nhymenium soon becomes more or less exposed, and in the latter it is\r\nenclosed in a perithecium. The Discomycetes are of two kinds, the\r\npileate and the cup-shaped. Of the pileate such a genus as _Gyromitra_\r\nor _Helvella_ is, in a certain sense, analogous to the Agarics\r\namongst _Hymenomycetes_, with a superior instead of an inferior\r\nhymenium, and enclosed, not naked, spores. Again, _Geoglossum_ is\r\nsomewhat analogous to _Clavaria_. Amongst the cup-shaped, _Peziza_\r\nis an Ascomycetous _Cyphella_. But these are perhaps more fanciful\r\nthan real analogies.\r\n\r\nRecently Boudier has examined one group of the cup-shaped Discomycetes,\r\nthe _Ascobolei_, and, by making a somewhat free use of his Memoir,[y] we\r\nmay arrive at a general idea of the structure in the cupulate\r\nDiscomycetes. They present themselves at first under the form of a\r\nsmall rounded globule, and almost entirely cellular. This small\r\nglobule, the commencement of the receptacle, is not long in increasing,\r\npreserving its rounded form up to the development of the asci. At this\r\nperiod, under the influence of the rapid growth of these organs, it soon\r\nproduces at its summit a fissure of the external membrane, which\r\nbecomes a more marked depression in the marginate species. The\r\nreceptacle thus formed increases rapidly, becomes plane, more convex,\r\nor more or less undulated at the margin, if at all of large size.\r\nFixed to the place where it is generated by some more or less\r\nabundant mycelioid filaments, the receptacle becomes somewhat\r\ncup-shaped and either stipitate or sessile, composed of the\r\nreceptacle proper and the hymenium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Section of cup of _Ascobolus_. _a._ External\r\ncells. _b._ Secondary layer. _c._ Subhymenial tissue (Janczenski).]\r\n\r\nThe receptacle proper comprehends the subhymenial tissue, the\r\nparenchyma, and the external membrane. The subhymenial tissue is\r\ncomposed of small compact cells, forming generally a more coloured and\r\ndense stratum, the superior cells of which give rise to the asci and\r\nparaphyses. The parenchyma is seated beneath this, and is generally of\r\ninterlaced filaments, of a looser consistency than the preceding,\r\nunited by intermediate cellules. The external membrane, which\r\nenvelopes the parenchyma, and limits the hymenium, differs from the\r\npreceding by the cells often being polyhedric, sometimes transverse,\r\nand united together, and sometimes separable. Externally it is\r\nsometimes smooth, and sometimes granular or hairy.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is, however, the most, important part, consisting of (1)\r\nthe paraphyses, (2) the asci, and sometimes (3) an investing mucilage.\r\nThe asci are always present, the paraphyses are sometimes rare, and\r\nthe mucilage in many cases seems to be entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nThe paraphyses, which are formed at the first commencement of the\r\nreceptacle, are at first very short, but soon elongate, and become\r\nwholly developed before the appearance of the asci. They are linear,\r\nsometimes branched and sometimes simple, often more or less thickened\r\nat their tips; almost always they contain within them some oleaginous\r\ngranules, either coloured or colourless. Their special function seems\r\nstill somewhat obscure, and Boudier suggests that they may be\r\nexcitatory organs for the dehiscence of the asci. However this may be,\r\nsome mycologists are of opinion that, at least in some of the\r\nAscomycetes, the paraphyses are abortive asci, or, at any rate, that\r\nabortive asci mixed with the paraphyses cannot be distinguished from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe mucilage forms itself almost at the same time as the paraphyses,\r\nand previous to the formation of the asci. This substance appears as a\r\ncolourless or yellowish mucilage, which envelopes the paraphyses and\r\nasci, and so covers the hymenium with a shining coat.\r\n\r\nThe asci appear first at the base of the paraphyses, under the form of\r\noblong cells, filled with colourless protoplasm. By rapid growth, they\r\nsoon attain a considerable size and fulness, the protoplasm being\r\ngradually absorbed by the sporidia, the first indication of which is\r\nalways the central nucleus. The mucilage also partly disappears, and\r\nthe asci, attaining their maturity, become quite distinct, each\r\nenclosing its sporidia. But before they take their complete growth\r\nthey detach themselves from the subhymenial tissue, and being\r\nattenuated towards their base, are forced upwards by pressure of the\r\nyounger asci, to, and in some instances beyond, the upper surface of\r\nthe disc. This phenomenon commences during the night, and continues\r\nduring the night and all the morning. It attains its height at\r\nmid-day, and it is then that the slightest breath of air, the\r\nslightest movement, suffices to cause dehiscence, which is generally\r\nfollowed by a scarcely perceptible contractile motion of the\r\nreceptacle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Asci, sporidia, and paraphyses of _Ascobolus_\r\n(Boudier).]\r\n\r\nThere is manifestly a succession in formation and maturity of the asci\r\nin a receptacle. In the true _Ascobolei_, in which the sporidia are\r\ncoloured, this may be more distinctly seen. At first some thin\r\nprojecting points appear upon the disc, the next day they are more\r\nnumerous, and become more and more so on following days, so as to\r\nrender the disc almost covered with raised black or crystalline\r\npoints;[z] these afterwards diminish day by day, until they ultimately\r\ncease. The asci, after separation from the subhymenial tissue,\r\ncontinue to lengthen, or it may be that their elasticity permits of\r\nextension, during expulsion. Boudier considers that an amount of\r\nelasticity is certain, because he has seen an ascus arrive at\r\nmaturity, eject its spores, and then make a sharp and considerable\r\nmovement of retraction, then the ascus returned again, immediately\r\ntowards its previous limits, always with a reduction in the number of\r\nits contained sporidia.\r\n\r\nThe dehiscence of the asci takes place in the _Ascobolei_, in some\r\nspecies of _Peziza_, _Morchella_, _Helvella_, and _Verpa_, by means of\r\nan apical operculum, and in other _Pezizæ_, _Helotium_, _Geoglossum_,\r\n_Leotia_, _Mitrula_, &c., by a fissure of the ascus. This operculum\r\nmay be the more readily seen when the ascus is coloured by a drop of\r\ntincture of iodine.\r\n\r\nThe sporidia are usually four or eight, or some multiple of that\r\nnumber, in each ascus, rarely four, most commonly eight. At a fixed\r\ntime the protoplasm, which at first filled the asci, disappears or is\r\nabsorbed in a mucilaginous matter, which occupies its place, in the\r\nmidst of which is a small nucleus, which is the rudiment of the first\r\nspore; other spores are formed consecutively, and then the substance\r\nseparates into as many sections as there are sporidia. From this\r\nperiod each sporidium seems to have a separate existence. All have a\r\nnucleus, which is scarcely visible, often slightly granular, but which\r\nis quite distinct from the oleaginous sporidioles so frequent amongst\r\nthe Discomycetes, and which are sometimes called by the same name. The\r\nsporidia are at first a little smaller than when mature, and are\r\nsurrounded by mucilage. After this period the sporidia lose their\r\nnebulous granulations, whilst still preserving their nucleus; their\r\noutlines are distinct, and, amongst the true _Ascobolei_, commence\r\nacquiring a rosy colour, the first intimation of maturity. This colour\r\nmanifests itself rapidly, accumulating exclusively upon the epispore,\r\nwhich becomes of a deep rose, then violet, and finally violet blue, so\r\ndeep as sometimes to appear quite black. There are some modifications\r\nin this coloration, since, in some species, it passes from a vinous\r\nred to grey, then to black, or from rose-violet to brown.\r\n\r\nThe epispore acquires a waxy consistence by this pigmentation, so that\r\nit may be detached in granules. It is to this particular consistency\r\nof the epispore that the cracks so frequent in the coloured sporidia\r\nof _Ascobolus_ are due, through contraction of the epispore. As they\r\napproach maturity, the sporidia accumulate towards the apex of the\r\nasci, and finally escape in the manner already indicated.\r\n\r\nIn all essential particulars there is a great similarity in the\r\nstructure of the other Discomycetes, especially in their reproductive\r\nsystem. In most of them coloured sporidia are rare. In some the\r\nreceptacle is pileate, clavate, or inflated, whilst in _Stictis_ it is\r\nvery much reduced, and in the lowest form of all, _Ascomyces_, it is\r\nentirely absent. In the _Phacidiacei_, the structure is very similar\r\nto that of the _Elvellacei_, whilst the _Hysteriacei_, with greater\r\naffinities with the latter, still tend towards the _Pyrenomycetes_ by\r\nthe more horny nature of the receptacle, and the greater tendency of\r\nthe hymenium to remain closed, at least when dry. In some species of\r\n_Hysterium_, the sporidia are remarkably fine. M. Duby[AA] has\r\nsubjected this group to examination, and M. Tulasne partly so.[AB]\r\n\r\nSPHÆRIACEI.--In this group there is considerable variation, within\r\ncertain limits. It contains an immense number of species, and these\r\nare daily being augmented. The general feature in all is the\r\npresence of a perithecium, which contains and encloses the hymenium,\r\nand at length opening by a pore or ostiolum at the apex. In some\r\nthe perithecia are simple, in others compound; in some immersed in\r\na stroma, in others free; in some fleshy or waxy, in others\r\ncarbonaceous, and in others membranaceous. But in all there is this\r\nimportant difference from the Ascomycetes we have already had under\r\nconsideration, that the hymenium is never exposed. The perithecium\r\nconsists usually of an external layer of cellular structure, which\r\nis either smooth or hairy, usually blackish, and an internal\r\nstratum of less compact cells, which give rise to the hymenium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Perithecium of _Sphæria_ and Section.]\r\n\r\nAs in the _Discomycetes_, the hymenium consists of asci, paraphyses,\r\nand mucilage, but the whole forms a less compact and more gelatinous\r\nmass within the perithecium. The formation and growth of the asci and\r\nsporidia differ little from what we have described, and when mature\r\nthe asci dehisce, and the sporidia alone are ejected from the\r\nostiolum. We are not aware that operculate asci have yet been\r\ndetected. It has been shown in some instances, and suspected in\r\nothers, that certain moulds, formerly classed with _Mucedines_ and\r\n_Dematiei_, especially in the genus _Helminthosporium_, bear the\r\nconidia of species of _Sphæria_, so that this may be regarded as one\r\nform of fruit.\r\n\r\nPerithecia, very similar externally to those of _Sphæria_, but\r\ncontaining spores borne on slender pedicels and not enclosed in asci,\r\nhave had their relations to certain species of _Sphæria_ indicated,\r\nand these are no longer regarded so much as species of _Hendersonia_\r\nor _Diplodia_ as the pycnidia of _Sphæria_. Other and more minute\r\nperithecia, containing minute, slender stylospores in great numbers,\r\nformerly classed with _Aposphæria_, _Phoma_, &c., but are now\r\nrecognized as spermogonia containing the spermatia of _Sphæriæ_. How\r\nthese influence each other, when and under what circumstances the\r\nspermatia are instrumental in impregnation of the sporidia, is still\r\nmatter of mystery. It is clear, however, that in all these conidia,\r\nmacrospores, microspores, and some spermatia, or by whatever names\r\nthey may be called, there exists a power of germination. Tulasne has\r\nindicated in some instances five or six forms of fruit as belonging to\r\none fungus, of which the highest and most perfect condition is a\r\nspecies of _Sphæria_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--_Uncinula adunca._]\r\n\r\nPERISPORIACEI.--Except in the perithecia rupturing irregularly, and\r\nnot dehiscing by a pore, some of the genera in this group differ\r\nlittle in structure from the _Sphæriacei_. On the other hand, the\r\n_Erysiphei_ present important and very interesting features. They\r\noccur chiefly on the green parts of growing plants. At first there is\r\na more or less profuse white mycelium.[AC] This gives rise to chains\r\nof conidia (_Oidium_), and afterwards small sphæroid projections\r\nappear at certain points on the mycelium. These enlarge, take an\r\norange colour, ultimately passing into brown, and then nearly black.\r\nExternally these perithecia are usually furnished with long,\r\nspreading, intertwined, or branching appendages, sometimes beautifully\r\nbranched or hooked at their tips. In the interior of the receptacles,\r\npear-shaped or ovate asci are formed in clusters, attached together at\r\nthe base, and containing two or more hyaline sporidia. Other forms of\r\nfruit have also been observed on the same mycelium. In an exotic\r\ngenus, _Meliola_, the fulcra, or appendages, as well as the mycelium,\r\nare black, otherwise it is very analogous to such a genus of\r\n_Erysiphei_ as _Microsphæria_. In _Chætomium_, the perithecia bristle\r\nwith rigid, dark-coloured hairs, and the sporidia are coloured. Our\r\nlimits, however, will not permit of further elucidation of the complex\r\nand varied structure to be found amongst fungi.[AD]\r\n\r\n   [A] A curious case occurred some years since at Bury St. Edmunds,\r\n       which may be mentioned here in connection with the development\r\n       of these nodules. Two children had died under suspicious\r\n       circumstances, and an examination of the body of the latter\r\n       after exhumation was made, a report having arisen that the\r\n       child died after eating mushrooms. As certain white nodules\r\n       appeared on the inner surface of the intestines, it was at once\r\n       hastily concluded that the spores of the mushroom had\r\n       germinated, and that the nodules were infant mushrooms. This\r\n       appeared to one of us so strange, that application was made for\r\n       specimens, which were kindly forwarded, and a cursory glance\r\n       was enough to convince us that they were not fungoid. An\r\n       examination under the microscope further confirmed the\r\n       diagnosis, and the application of nitric acid showed that the\r\n       nodules were merely due to chalk mixture, which had been given\r\n       to the child for the diarrhetic symptoms under which he\r\n       succumbed.\r\n\r\n   [B] Ehrenberg compared the whole structure of an Agaric with that\r\n       of a mould, the mycelium corresponding with the hyphasma,\r\n       the stem and pileus with the flocci, and the hymenium with\r\n       the fructifying branchlets. The comparison is no less\r\n       ingenious than true, and gives a lively idea of the connection\r\n       of the more noble with the more humble fungi.--_Ehrb. de\r\n       Mycetogenesi._\r\n\r\n   [C] In _Paxillus involutus_ the hymenium may be readily torn off and\r\n       unfolded.\r\n\r\n   [D] This was well delineated in \"Flora Danica,\" plate 834, as\r\n       observed in _Coprinus comatus_ as long ago as 1780.\r\n\r\n   [E] A. de Bary, \"Morphologie und Physiologie der Pilze,\" in\r\n       \"Hofmeister's Handbuch,\" vol. ii. cap. 5, 1866, translated in\r\n       \"Grevillea,\" vol. i. p. 181.\r\n\r\n   [F] \"Die Pollinarien und Spermatien von _Agaricus_,\" in \"Botanische\r\n       Zeitung,\" Feb. 29 and March 7, 1856.\r\n\r\n   [G] \"Essai d'une Flore mycologique de la Région de Montpellier.\"\r\n       Paris, 1863.\r\n\r\n   [H] Hoffmann, \"Botanische Zeitung,\" 1856, p. 139.\r\n\r\n   [I] Corda, \"Icones Fungorum hucusque cognitorum,\" iii. p. 41.

C., \"Anatomy of a Mushroom,\" in \"Popular Science\r\n       Review,\" vol. viii. p. 380.\r\n\r\n   [K] An attempt was made to show that, in _Agaricus melleus_, distinct\r\n       asci were found, in a certain stage, on the gills or lamellæ.\r\n       We have in vain examined the gills in various conditions, and\r\n       could never detect anything of the kind. It is probable that\r\n       the asci belonged to some species of _Hypomyces_, a genus of\r\n       parasitic Sphæriaceous fungi.\r\n\r\n   [L] It is not intended that the spores are always quaternate in\r\n       _Agaricini_, though that number is constant in the more typical\r\n       species. They sometimes exceed four, and are sometimes reduced\r\n       to one.\r\n\r\n   [M] The species long known as _Hydnum gelatinosum_ was examined by\r\n       Mr. F. Currey in 1860 (_Journ. Linn. Soc._), and he came to the\r\n       conclusion that it was not a good _Hydnum_. Since then it has\r\n       been made the type of a new genus (Hydnogloea B. and Br.\r\n       or, as called by Fries, in the new edition of \"Epicrisis,\"\r\n       _Tremellodon_, Pers. Myc. Eur.), and transferred to the\r\n       _Tremellini_. Currey says, upon examining the fructification,\r\n       he was surprised to find that, although in its external\r\n       characters it was a perfect _Hydnum_, it bore the fruit of a\r\n       _Tremella_. If one of the teeth be examined with the\r\n       microscope, it will be seen to consist of threads bearing\r\n       four-lobed sporophores, and spores exactly similar to\r\n       _Tremella_. It will thus be seen, he adds, that the plant\r\n       is exactly intermediate between _Hydnei_ and _Tremellini_,\r\n       forming, as it were, a stepping-stone from one to the other.\r\n\r\n   [N] Tulasne, L.

It would hardly avail to\r\nenter too minutely into details, yet sufficient should be attempted to\r\nenable the reader to comprehend the value and relations of the\r\ndifferent groups into which fungi are divided. The arrangement\r\ngenerally adopted is based upon the \"Systema Mycologicum\" of Fries, as\r\nmodified to meet the requirements of more recent microscopical\r\nresearches by Berkeley in his \"Introduction,\"[A] and adopted in\r\nLindley's \"Vegetable Kingdom.\" Another arrangement was proposed by\r\nProfessor de Bary,[B] but it has never met with general acceptance.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement to which we have alluded, all fungi are divided\r\ninto two primary sections, having reference to the mode in which the\r\nfructification is produced. In one section, the spores (which occupy\r\nnearly the same position, and perform similar functions, to the seeds\r\nof higher plants) are naked; that is, they are produced on spicules,\r\nand are not enclosed in cysts or capsules. This section is called\r\nSPORIFERA, or spore-bearing, because, by general consent, the term\r\n_spore_ is limited in fungi to such germ-cells as are not produced in\r\ncysts. The second section is termed SPORIDIIFERA, or sporidia-bearing,\r\nbecause in like manner the term _sporidia_ is limited to such\r\ngerm-cells as are produced in cells or cysts. These cysts are\r\nrespectively known as _sporangia_, and _asci_ or _thecæ_. The true\r\nmeaning and value of these divisions will be better comprehended when\r\nwe have detailed the characters of the families composing these two\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, the section SPORIFERA contains four families, in two of\r\nwhich a hymenium is present, and in two there is no proper hymenium.\r\nThe term _hymenium_ is employed to represent a more or less expanded\r\nsurface, on which the fructification is produced, and is, in fact, the\r\nfruit-bearing surface. When no such surface is present, the fruit is\r\nborne on threads, proceeding direct from the root-like filaments of\r\nthe mycelium, or an intermediate kind of cushion or stroma. The two\r\nfamilies in which an hymenium is present are called _Hymenomycetes_\r\nand _Gasteromycetes_. In the former, the hymenium is exposed; in the\r\nlatter, it is at first enclosed. We must examine each of these\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe common mushroom may be accepted, by way of illustration, as a type\r\nof the family _Hymenomycetes_, in which the hymenium is exposed, and\r\nis, in fact, the most noticeable feature in the family from which its\r\nname is derived. The pileus or cap bears on its under surface\r\nradiating plates or gills, consisting of the hymenium, over which are\r\nthickly scattered the basidia, each surmounted by four spicules, and\r\non each spicule a spore. When mature, these spores fall freely upon\r\nthe ground beneath, imparting to it the general colour of the spores.\r\nBut it must be observed that the hymenium takes the form of\r\ngill-plates in only one order of _Hymenomycetes_, namely, the\r\n_Agaricini_; and here, as in _Cantharellus_, the hymenium is sometimes\r\nspread over prominent veins rather than gills. Still further\r\ndivergence is manifest in the _Polyporei_, in which order the hymenium\r\nlines the inner surface of pores or tubes, which are normally on the\r\nunder side of the pileus. Both these orders include an immense number\r\nof species, the former more or less fleshy, the latter more or less\r\ntough and leathery. There are still other forms and orders in this\r\nfamily, as the _Hydnei_, in which the hymenium clothes the surface of\r\nprickles or spines, and the _Auricularini_, in which the hymenium is\r\nentirely or almost even. In the two remaining orders, there is a\r\nstill further divergence from the mushroom form. In the one called\r\n_Clavariei_, the entire fungus is either simply cylindrical or\r\nclub-shaped, or it is very much branched and ramified. Whatever form\r\nthe fungus assumes, the hymenium covers the whole exposed surface. In\r\nthe _Tremellini_, a peculiar structure prevails, which at first seems\r\nto agree but little with the preceding. The whole plant is gelatinous\r\nwhen fresh, lobed and convolute, often brain-like, and varying in\r\nsize, according to species, from that of a pin's head to that of a\r\nman's head. Threads and sporophores are imbedded in the gelatinous\r\nsubstance,[C] so that the fertile threads are in reality not compacted\r\ninto a true hymenium. With this introduction we may state that the\r\ntechnical characters of the family are thus expressed:--\r\n\r\n_Hymenium free, mostly naked, or, if enclosed at first, soon\r\nexposed; spores naked, mostly quaternate, on distinct spicules_ =\r\nHYMENOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--_Agaricus nudus._]\r\n\r\nIn this family some mycologists believe that fungi attain the highest\r\nform of development of which they are capable, whilst others contend\r\nthat the fructification of the _Ascomycetes_ is more perfect, and that\r\nsome of the noblest species, such as the pileate forms, are entitled\r\nto the first rank. The morel is a familiar example. Whatever may be\r\nsaid on this point, it is incontrovertible that the noblest and most\r\nattractive, as well as the largest, forms are classed under the\r\n_Hymenomycetes_.\r\n\r\nIn _Gasteromycetes_, the second family, a true hymenium is also\r\npresent, but instead of being exposed it is for a long time enclosed\r\nin an outer peridium or sac, until the spores are fully matured, or\r\nthe fungus is beginning to decay. The common puff-ball (_Lycoperdon_)\r\nis well known, and will illustrate the principal feature of the\r\nfamily. Externally there is a tough coat or peridium, which is at\r\nfirst pale, but ultimately becomes brown. Internally is at first a\r\ncream-coloured, then greenish, cellular mass, consisting of the\r\nsinuated hymenium and young spores, which at length, and when the\r\nspores are fully matured become brownish and dusty, the hymenium\r\nbeing broken up into threads, and the spores become free. In earlier\r\nstages, and before the hymenium is ruptured, the spores have been\r\nfound to harmonize with those of _Hymenomycetes_ in their mode of\r\nproduction, since basidia are present surmounted each by four\r\nspicules, and each spicule normally surmounted by a spore.[D] Here is,\r\ntherefore, a cellular hymenium bearing quaternary spores, but,\r\ninstead of being exposed, this hymenium is wholly enclosed within\r\nan external sac or peridium, which is not ruptured until the\r\nspores are fully matured, and the hymenium is resolved into\r\nthreads, together forming a pulverulent mass. It must, however, be\r\nborne in mind, that in only some of the orders composing this\r\nfamily is the hymenium thus evanescent, in others being more or less\r\npermanent, and this has led naturally enough to the recognition of\r\ntwo sub-families, in one of which the hymenium is more or less\r\npermanent, thus following the Hymenomycetous type; and in the\r\nother, the hymenium is evanescent, and the dusty mass of spores tends\r\nmore towards the _Coniomycetes_, this being characterized as the\r\nconiospermous (or dusty-spored) sub-family.\r\n\r\nThe first sub-family includes, first of all, the _Hypogæi_, or\r\nsubterranean species. And here again it becomes necessary to remind\r\nthe reader that all subterranean fungi are not included in this\r\norder, inasmuch as some, of which the truffle is an example, are\r\nsporidiiferous, developing their sporidia in asci. To these allusion\r\nmust hereafter be made. In the _Hypogæi_, the hymenium is permanent and\r\nconvoluted, leaving numerous minute irregular cavities, in which the\r\nspores are produced on sporophores. When specimens are very old and\r\ndecaying, the interior may become pulverulent or deliquescent. The\r\nstructure of subterranean fungi attracted the attention of Messrs.\r\nTulasne, and led to the production of a splendid monograph on the\r\nsubject.[E] Another order belonging to this sub-family is the\r\n_Phalloidei_, in which the volva or peridium is ruptured whilst the\r\nplant is still immature, and the hymenium when mature becomes\r\ndeliquescent. Not only are some members of this order most singular in\r\nappearance, but they possess an odour so foetid as to be unapproached in\r\nthis property by any other vegetable production.[F] In this order, the\r\ninner stratum of the investing volva is gelatinous. When still young,\r\nand previous to the rupture of the volva, the hymenium presents sinuous\r\ncavities in which the spores are produced on spicules, after the\r\nmanner of _Hymenomycetes_.[G] _Nidulariacei_ is a somewhat aberrant\r\norder, presenting a peculiar structure. The peridium consists of two or\r\nthree coats, and bursts at the apex, either irregularly or in a\r\nstellate manner, or by the separation of a little lid. Within the\r\ncavity are contained one or more secondary receptacles, which are\r\neither free or attached by elastic threads to the common receptacle.\r\nUltimately the secondary receptacles are hollow, and spores are\r\nproduced in the interior, borne on spicules.[H] The appearance in some\r\ngenera as of a little bird's-nest containing eggs has furnished the\r\nname to the order.\r\n\r\nThe second sub-family contains the coniospermous puff-balls, and\r\nincludes two orders, in which the most readily distinguishable\r\nfeature is the cellular condition of the entire plant, in its earlier\r\nstages, in the _Trichogastres_, and the gelatinous condition of\r\nthe early state of the _Myxogastres_. Both are ultimately resolved\r\ninternally into a dusty mass of threads and spores. In the former,\r\nthe peridium is either single or double, occasionally borne on a\r\nstem, but usually sessile. In _Geaster_, the \"starry puff-balls,\" the\r\nouter peridium divides into several lobes, which fall back in a\r\nstellate manner, and expose the inner peridium, like a ball in the\r\ncentre. In _Polysaccum_, the interior is divided into numerous\r\ncells, filled with secondary peridia. The mode of spore-production\r\nhas already been alluded to in our remarks on _Lycoperdon_. All\r\nthe species are large, as compared with those of the following\r\nsub-family, and one species of _Lycoperdon_ attains an enormous\r\nsize. One specimen recorded in the \"Gardener's Chronicle\" was\r\nthree feet four inches in circumference, and weighed nearly ten\r\npounds. In the _Myxogastres_, the early stage has been the subject of\r\nmuch controversy. The gelatinous condition presents phenomena so\r\nunlike anything previously recorded in plants, that one learned\r\nprofessor[I] did not hesitate to propose their exclusion from the\r\nvegetable, and recognition in the animal, kingdom as associates of\r\nthe Gregarines. When mature, the spores and threads so much resemble\r\nthose of the _Trichogastres_, and the little plants themselves are\r\nso veritably miniature puff-balls, that the theory of their animal\r\nnature did not meet with a ready acceptance, and is now virtually\r\nabandoned. The characters of the family we have thus briefly reviewed\r\nare tersely stated, as--\r\n\r\n_Hymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in most cases\r\nof closely-packed cells, of which the fertile ones bear naked spores\r\non distinct spicules, exposed only by the rupture or decay of the\r\ninvesting coat or peridium_ = GASTEROMYCETES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--_Scleroderma vulgare_, Fr.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--_Ceuthospora phacidioides_ (Greville).]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the second section of the _Sporifera_, in which no\r\ndefinite hymenium is present. And here we find also two families, in\r\none of which the dusty spores are the prominent feature, and hence\r\ntermed _Coniomycetes_; the other, in which the threads are most\r\nnoticeable, is _Hyphomycetes_. In the former of these, the reproductive\r\nsystem seems to preponderate so much over the vegetative, that the\r\nfungus appears to be all spores. The mycelium is often nearly\r\nobsolete, and the short pedicels so evanescent, that a rusty or sooty\r\npowder represents the mature fungus, infesting the green parts of\r\nliving plants. This is more especially true of one or two orders. It\r\nwill be most convenient to recognize two artificial sub-families for\r\nthe purpose of illustration, in one of which the species are developed\r\non living, and in the other on dead, plants. We will commence with the\r\nlatter, recognizing first those which are developed beneath the\r\ncuticle, and then those which are superficial. Of the sub-cuticular,\r\ntwo orders may be named as the representatives of this group in\r\nBritain, these are the _Sphæronemei_, in which the spores are contained\r\nin a more or less perfect perithecium, and the _Melanconiei_, in which\r\nthere is manifestly none. The first of these is analogous to the\r\n_Sphæriacei_ of _Ascomycetous_ fungi, and probably consists largely of\r\nspermogonia of known species of _Sphæria_, the relations of which have\r\nnot hitherto been traced. The spores are produced on slender threads\r\nspringing from the inner wall of the perithecium, and, when mature, are\r\nexpelled from an orifice at the apex. This is the normal condition, to\r\nwhich there are some exceptions. In the _Melanconiei_, there is no\r\ntrue perithecium, but the spores are produced in like manner upon a kind\r\nof stroma or cushion formed from the mycelium, and, when mature, are\r\nexpelled through a rupture of the cuticle beneath which they are\r\ngenerated, often issuing in long gelatinous tendrils. Here, again,\r\nthe majority of what were formerly regarded as distinct species have\r\nbeen found, or suspected, to be forms of higher fungi. The _Torulacei_\r\nrepresent the superficial fungi of this family, and these consist of a\r\nmore or less developed mycelium, which gives rise to fertile threads,\r\nwhich, by constriction and division, mature into moniliform chains\r\nof spores. The species mostly appear as blackish velvety patches or\r\nstains on the stems of herbaceous plants and on old weathered wood.\r\n\r\nMuch interest attaches to the other sub-family of _Coniomycetes_, in which\r\nthe species are produced for the most part on living plants. So much\r\nhas been discovered during recent years of the polymorphism which\r\nsubsists amongst the species in this section, that any detailed\r\nclassification can only be regarded as provisional. Hence we shall\r\nproceed here upon the supposition that we are dealing with autonomous\r\nspecies. In the first place, we must recognize a small section in which\r\na kind of cellular peridium is present. This is the _Æcidiacei_, or order\r\nof \"cluster cups.\" The majority of species are very beautiful objects\r\nunder the microscope; the peridia are distinctly cellular, and white or\r\npallid, produced beneath the cuticle, through which they burst, and,\r\nrupturing at the apex, in one genus in a stellate manner, so that the\r\nteeth, becoming reflexed, resemble delicate fringed cups, with the\r\norange, golden, brown, or whitish spores or pseudospores nestling in the\r\ninterior.[J] These pseudospores are at first produced in chains, but\r\nultimately separate. In many cases these cups are either accompanied or\r\npreceded by spermogonia. In two other orders there is no peridium. In the\r\n_Cæomacei_, the pseudospores are more or less globose or ovate, sometimes\r\nlaterally compressed and simple; and in _Pucciniæi_, they are elongated,\r\noften subfusiform and septate. In both, the pseudospores are produced\r\nin tufts or clusters _direct from the mycelium. The Cæomacei_ might\r\nagain be subdivided into _Ustilagines_[K] and _Uredines_.[L] In the\r\nformer, the pseudospores are mostly dingy brown or blackish, and in the\r\nlatter more brightly coloured, often yellowish. The _Ustilagines_\r\ninclude the smuts and bunt of corn-plants, the _Uredines_ include the\r\nred rusts of wheat and grasses. In some of the species included in the\r\nlatter, two forms of fruit are found. In _Melampsora_, the summer\r\npseudospores are yellow, globose, and were formerly classed as a species\r\nof _Lecythea_, whilst the winter pseudospores are brownish, elongated,\r\nwedge-shaped by compression, and compact. The _Pucciniæi_[M] differ\r\nprimarily in the septate pseudospores, which in one genus (_Puccinia_) are\r\nuniseptate; in _Triphragmium_, they are biseptate; in _Phragmidium_,\r\nmultiseptate; and in _Xenodochus_, moniliform, breaking up into\r\ndistinct articulations. It is probable that, in all of these, as is\r\nknown to be the case in most, the septate pseudospores are preceded or\r\naccompanied by simple pseudospores, to which they are mysteriously\r\nrelated. There is still another, somewhat singular, group usually\r\nassociated with the _Pucciniæi_, in which the septate pseudospores are\r\nimmersed in gelatin, so that in many features the species seem to\r\napproach the _Tremellini_. This group includes two or three genera, the\r\ntype of which will be found in _Podisoma_.[N] These fungi are parasitic on\r\nliving junipers in Britain and North America, appearing year after year\r\nupon the same gouty swellings of the branches, in clavate or horn-shaped\r\ngelatinous processes of a yellowish or orange colour. Anomalous as it\r\nmay at first sight appear to include these tremelloid forms with the\r\ndust-like fungi, their relations will on closer examination be more fully\r\nappreciated, when the form of pseudospores, mode of germination, and\r\nother features are taken into consideration, especially when compared with\r\n_Podisoma Ellisii_, already alluded to. This family is technically\r\ncharacterized as,--\r\n\r\n_Distinct hymenium none. Pseudospores either solitary or concatenate,\r\nproduced on the tips of generally short threads, which are either\r\nnaked or contained in a perithecium, rarely compacted into a\r\ngelatinous mass, at length producing minute spores_ = CONIOMYCETES.\r\n\r\nThe last family of the sporifera is _Hyphomycetes_, in which the\r\nthreads are conspicuously developed. These are what are more\r\ncommonly called \"moulds,\" including some of the most elegant and\r\ndelicate of microscopic forms. It is true of many of these, as well\r\nas of the _Coniomycetes_, that they are only conidial forms of\r\nhigher fungi; but there will remain a very large number of species\r\nwhich, as far as present knowledge extends, must be accepted as\r\nautonomous. In this family, we may again recognize three subdivisions,\r\nin one of which the threads are more or less compacted into a common\r\nstem, in another the threads are free, and in the third the threads\r\ncan scarcely be distinguished from the mycelium. It is this latter\r\ngroup which unites the _Hyphomycetes_ with the _Coniomycetes_, the\r\naffinities being increased by the great profusion with which the\r\nspores are developed. The first group, in which the fertile threads\r\nare united so as to form a compound stem, consists of two small\r\norders, the _Isariacei_ and the _Stilbacei_, in the former of which\r\nthe spores are dry, and in the latter somewhat gelatinous. Many of\r\nthe species closely imitate forms met with in the _Hymenomycetes_,\r\nsuch as _Clavaria_; and, in the genus _Isaria_, it is almost beyond\r\ndoubt that the species found on dead insects, moths, spiders,\r\nflies, ants, &c., are merely the conidiophores of species of\r\n_Torrubia_.[O]\r\n\r\nThe second group is by far the largest, most typical, and attractive\r\nin this family. It contains the black moulds and white moulds,\r\ntechnically known as the _Dematiei_ and the _Mucedines_. In the first,\r\nthe threads are more or less corticated, that is, the stem has a\r\ndistinct investing membrane, which peels off like a bark; and the\r\nthreads, often also the spores, are dark-coloured, as if charred or\r\nscorched. In many cases, the spores are highly developed, large,\r\nmultiseptate, and nucleate, and seldom are spores and threads\r\ncolourless or of bright tints. In the _Mucedines_, on the contrary,\r\nthe threads are never coated, seldom dingy, mostly white or of pure\r\ncolours, and the spores have less a tendency to extra development or\r\nmultiplex septation. In some genera, as in _Peronospora_ for\r\ninstance,[P] a secondary fruit is produced in the form of resting\r\nspores from the mycelium; and these generate zoospores as well as the\r\nprimary spores, similar to those common in _Algæ_. This latter genus\r\nis very destructive to growing plants, one species being the chief\r\nagent in the potato disease, and another no less destructive to crops\r\nof onions. The vine disease is produced by a species of _Oidium_,\r\nwhich is also classed with _Mucedines_, but which is really the\r\nconidiiferous form of _Erysiphe_. In other genera, the majority of\r\nspecies are developed on decaying plants, so that, with the exception\r\nof the two genera mentioned, the _Hyphomycetes_ exert a much less\r\nbaneful influence on vegetation than the _Coniomycetes_. The last\r\nsection, including the _Sepedoniei_, has been already cited as\r\nremarkable for the suppression of the threads, which are scarcely to\r\nbe distinguished from the mycelium; the spores are profuse, nestling\r\non the floccose mycelium; whilst in the _Trichodermacei_, the spores\r\nare invested by the threads, as if enclosed in a sort of false\r\nperidium. A summary of the characters of the family may therefore be\r\nthus briefly expressed:--\r\n\r\n_Filamentous; fertile threads naked, for the most part free or loosely\r\ncompacted, simple or branched, bearing the spores at their apices,\r\nrarely more closely packed, so as to form a distinct common stem_ =\r\nHYPHOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--_Rhopalomyces candidus._]\r\n\r\nHaving thus disposed of the _Sporifera_, we must advert to the two\r\nfamilies of _Sporidiifera_. As more closely related to the _Hyphomycetes_,\r\nthe first of these to be noticed is the _Physomycetes_, in which there\r\nis no proper hymenium, and the threads proceeding from the mycelium bear\r\nvesicles containing an indefinite number of sporidia. The fertile threads\r\nare either free or only slightly felted. In the order _Antennariei_, the\r\nthreads are black and moniliform, more or less felted, bearing irregular\r\nsporangia. A common fungus named _Zasmidium cellare_, found in cellars,\r\nand incrusting old wine bottles, as with a blackened felt, belongs to\r\nthis order. The larger and more highly-developed order, _Mucorini_,\r\ndiffers in the threads, which are simple or branched, being free, erect,\r\nand bearing the sporangia at the tips of the thread, or branches. Some of\r\nthe species bear great external resemblance to _Mucedines_ until the\r\nfruit is examined, when the fructifying heads, commonly globose or ovate,\r\nare found to be delicate transparent vesicles, enclosing a large number\r\nof minute sporidia; when mature, the sporangia burst and the sporidia\r\nare set free. In some species, it has long been known that a sort of\r\nconjugation takes place between opposite threads, which results in the\r\nformation of a sporangium.[Q] None of these species are destructive to\r\nvegetation, appearing only upon decaying, and not upon living, plants.\r\nA state approaching putrescence seems to be essential to their vigorous\r\ndevelopment. The following characters may be compared with those of\r\nthe family preceding it:--\r\n\r\n_Filamentous, threads free or only slightly felted, bearing vesicles,\r\nwhich contain indefinite sporidia_ = PHYSOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--_Mucor caninus._]\r\n\r\nIn the last family, the _Ascomycetes_, we shall meet with a very great\r\nvariety of forms, all agreeing in producing sporidia contained in\r\ncertain cells called asci, which are produced from the hymenium. In\r\nsome of these, the asci are evanescent, but in the greater number are\r\npermanent. In _Onygenei_, the receptacle is either club-shaped or\r\nsomewhat globose, and the peridium is filled with branched threads,\r\nwhich produce asci of a very evanescent character, leaving the\r\npulverulent sporidia to fill the central cavity. The species are all\r\nsmall, and singular for their habit of affecting animal substances,\r\notherwise they are of little importance. The _Perisporiacei_, on the\r\nother hand, are very destructive of vegetation, being produced, in the\r\nmajority of cases, on the green parts of growing plants. To this order\r\nthe hop mildew, rose mildew, and pea mildew belong. The mycelium is\r\noften very much developed, and in the case of the maple, pea, hop, and\r\nsome others, it covers the parts attacked with a thick white coating,\r\nso that from a distance the leaves appear to have been whitewashed.\r\nSeated on the mycelium, at the first as little orange points, are the\r\nperithecia, which enlarge and become nearly black. In some species,\r\nvery elegant whitish appendages radiate from the sides of the\r\nperithecia, the variations in which aid in the discrimination of\r\nspecies. The perithecia contain pear-shaped asci, which spring from\r\nthe base and enclose a definite number of sporidia.[R] The asci\r\nthemselves are soon dissolved. Simultaneously with the development of\r\nsporidia, other reproductive bodies are produced direct from the\r\nmycelium, and in some species as many as five different kinds of\r\nreproductive bodies have been traced. The features to be remembered in\r\n_Perisporiacei_, as forming the basis of their classification, are,\r\nthat the asci are saccate, springing from the base of the perithecia,\r\nand are soon absorbed. Also that the perithecia themselves are not\r\nperforated at the apex.\r\n\r\nThe four remaining orders, though large, can be easily characterized.\r\nIn _Tuberacei_, all the species are subterranean, and the hymenium is\r\nmostly sinuated. In _Elvellacei_, the substance is more or less\r\nfleshy, and the hymenium is exposed. In _Phacidiacei_, the substance\r\nis hard or leathery, and the hymenium is soon exposed. And in\r\n_Sphæriacei_, although the substance is variable, the hymenium is\r\nnever exposed, being enclosed in perithecia with a distinct opening at\r\nthe apex, through which the mature spores escape. Each of these four\r\norders must be examined more in detail. The _Tuberacei_, or\r\nsubterranean _Ascomycetes_, are analogous to the _Hypogæi_ of the\r\n_Gasteromycetes_. The truffle is a familiar and highly prized example.\r\nThere is a kind of outer peridium, and the interior consists of a\r\nfleshy hymenium, more or less convoluted, sometimes sinuous and\r\nconfluent, so as to leave only minute elongated and irregular\r\ncavities, and sometimes none at all, the two opposing faces of the\r\nhymenium meeting and coalescing.[S] Certain privileged cells of the\r\nhymenium swell, and ultimately become asci, enclosing a definite\r\nnumber of sporidia. The sporidia in many cases are large, reticulated,\r\nechinulate or verrucose, and mostly somewhat globose. In the genus\r\n_Elaphomyces_, the asci are more than commonly diffluent.\r\n\r\nThe _Elvellacei_ are fleshy in substance, or somewhat waxy, sometimes\r\ntremelloid. There is no peridium, but the hymenium is always exposed.\r\nThere is a great variety of forms, some being pileate, and others\r\ncup-shaped, as there is also a great variation in size, from the\r\nminute _Peziza_, small as a grain of sand, to the large _Helvella\r\ngigas_, which equals in dimensions the head of a child. In the pileate\r\nforms, the stroma is fleshy and highly developed; in the cup-shaped,\r\nit is reduced to the external cells of the cup which enclose the\r\nhymenium. The hymenium itself consists of elongated fertile cells, or\r\nasci, mixed with linear thread-like barren cells, called paraphyses,\r\nwhich are regarded by some authors as barren asci. These are placed\r\nside by side in juxtaposition with the apex outwards. Each ascus\r\ncontains a definite number of sporidia, which are sometimes coloured.\r\nWhen mature, the asci explode above, and the sporidia may be seen\r\nescaping like a miniature cloud of smoke in the light of the mid-day\r\nsun. The disc or surface of the hymenium is often brightly coloured in\r\nthe genus _Peziza_; tints of orange, red, and brown having the\r\npredominance.\r\n\r\nIn _Phacidiacei_, the substance is hard and leathery, intermediate\r\nbetween the fleshy _Elvellacei_ and the more horny of the _Sphæriacei_.\r\nThe perithecia are either orbicular or elongated, and the hymenium soon\r\nbecomes exposed. In some instances, there is a close affinity with\r\nthe _Elvellacei_, the exposed hymenium being similar in structure,\r\nbut in all the disc is at first closed. In orbicular forms, the\r\nfissure takes place in a stellate manner from the centre, and the\r\nteeth are reflexed. In the _Hysteriacei_, where the perithecia are\r\nelongated, the fissure takes place throughout their length. As a\r\nrule, the sporidia are more elongated, more commonly septate, and more\r\nusually coloured, than in _Elvellacei_. Only a few solitary instances\r\noccur of individual species that are parasitic on living plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--_Sphæria aquila._]\r\n\r\nIn the _Sphæriacei_, the substance of the stroma (when present) and of\r\nthe perithecia is variable, being between fleshy and waxy in\r\n_Nectriei_, and tough, horny, sometimes brittle, in _Hypoxylon_. A\r\nperithecium, or cell excavated in the stroma which fulfils the\r\nfunctions of a perithecium, is always present. The hymenium lines the\r\ninner walls of the perithecium, and forms a gelatinous nucleus,\r\nconsisting of asci and paraphyses. When fully mature, the asci are\r\nruptured and the sporidia escape by a pore which occupies the apex of\r\nthe perithecium. Sometimes the perithecia are solitary or scattered,\r\nand sometimes gregarious, whilst in other instances they are closely\r\naggregated and immersed in a stroma of variable size and form.\r\nConidia, spermatia, pycnidia, &c., have been traced to and associated\r\nwith some species, but the history of others is still obscure. Many of\r\nthe coniomycetous forms grouped under the _Sphæronemei_ are probably\r\nconditions of the _Sphæriacei_, as are also the _Melanconiei_, and\r\nsome of the _Hyphomycetes_. A very common fungus, for instance, which\r\nis abundant on sticks and twigs, forming rosy or reddish pustules the\r\nsize of a millet seed, formerly named _Tubercularia vulgaris_, is\r\nknown to be the conidia-bearing stroma of the sphæriaceous fungus,\r\n_Nectria cinnabarina_;[T] and so with many others. The following are\r\nthe technical characters of the family:--\r\n\r\n_Fruit consisting of sporidia, mostly definite, contained in asci,\r\nspringing from a naked or enclosed stratum of fructifying cells and\r\nforming a hymenium or nucleus_ = ASCOMYCETES.\r\n\r\nIf the characters of the different families are borne in mind, there\r\nwill be but little difficulty in assigning any fungus to the order to\r\nwhich it belongs by means of the foregoing remarks. For more minute\r\ninformation, and for analytical tables of the families, orders, and\r\ngenera, we must refer the student to some special systematic work,\r\nwhich will present fewer difficulties, if he keeps in mind the\r\ndistinctive features of the families.[U]\r\n\r\nTo assist in this we have given on the following page an analytical\r\narrangement of the families and orders, according to the system\r\nrecognized and adopted in the present volume.

Excepting those\r\nwhich are employed more or less for human food, very few are of any\r\npractical value in arts or medicine. It is true that imperfect\r\nconditions of fungi exert a very important influence on fermentation,\r\nand thus become useful; but, unfortunately, fungi have the reputation\r\nof being more destructive and offensive than valuable or useful.\r\nNotwithstanding that a large number of species have from time to time\r\nbeen enumerated as edible, yet those commonly employed and recognized\r\nare very few in number, prejudice in many cases, and fear in others,\r\nmilitating strongly against additions to the number. In Great Britain\r\nthis is especially the case, and however advisable it may be to\r\nexercise great care and caution in experimenting on untried or\r\ndoubtful species, it can only be regarded as prejudice which prevents\r\ngood, in fact, excellent, esculent species being more extensively\r\nused, instead of allowing them to rot by thousands on the spots where\r\nthey have grown. Poisonous species are also plentiful, and no golden\r\nrule can be established by means of which any one may detect at a\r\nglance good from bad, without that kind of knowledge which is applied\r\nto the discrimination of species. Yet, after all, the characters of\r\nhalf a dozen good esculent fungi are acquired as easily as the\r\ndistinctions between half a dozen birds such as any ploughboy can\r\ndiscriminate.\r\n\r\nThe common mushroom (_Agaricus campestris_) is the best known\r\nesculent, whether in its uncultivated or in a cultivated state. In\r\nBritain many thousands of people, notably the lower classes, will not\r\nrecognize any other as fit for food, whilst in Italy the same classes\r\nhave a strong prejudice against this very species.[A] In Vienna, we\r\nfound by personal experience that, although many others are eaten, it\r\nis this which has the most universal preference, yet it appears but\r\nsparingly in the markets as compared with others. In Hungary it does\r\nnot enjoy by any means so good a reputation. In France and in Germany\r\nit is a common article of consumption. The different varieties found,\r\nas the results of cultivation, present some variation in colour,\r\nscaliness of pileus, and other minor features, whilst remaining true\r\nto the constituent characters of the species. Although it is not our\r\nintention to enumerate here the botanical distinctions of the species\r\nto which we may call attention, yet, as mistakes (sometimes fatal) are\r\noften being recorded, in which other fungi are confounded with this,\r\nwe may be permitted a hint or two which should be remembered. The\r\nspores are purple, the gills are at first delicate pink, afterwards\r\npurple; there is a permanent ring or collar round the stem, and it\r\nmust _not_ be sought in woods. Many accidents might have been spared\r\nhad these facts been remembered.\r\n\r\nThe meadow mushroom (_Agaricus arvensis_) is common in meadows and\r\nlowland pastures, and is usually of a larger size than the preceding,\r\nwith which it agrees in many particulars, and is sent in enormous\r\nquantities to Covent Garden, where it frequently predominates over\r\n_Agaricus campestris_. Some persons prefer this, which has a stronger\r\nflavour, to the ordinary mushroom, and it is the species most commonly\r\nsold in the autumn in the streets of London and provincial towns.\r\nAccording to Persoon, it is preferred in France; and, in Hungary, it\r\nis considered as a special gift from St. George. It has acquired in\r\nEngland the name of horse mushroom, from the enormous size it\r\nsometimes attains. Withering mentions a specimen that weighed fourteen\r\npounds.[B]\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest (in our experience the _most_ common) of all\r\nedible fungi in the public markets of Vienna is the Hallimasche\r\n(_Agaricus melleus_), which in England enjoys no good reputation for\r\nflavour or quality; indeed, Dr. Badham calls it \"nauseous and\r\ndisagreeable,\" and adds that \"not to be poisonous is its only\r\nrecommendation.\" In Vienna it is employed chiefly for making sauce;\r\nbut we must confess that even in this way, and with a prejudice in\r\nfavour of Viennese cookery, our experience of it was not satisfactory.\r\nIt is at best a sorry substitute for the mushroom. In the summer and\r\nautumn this is a very common species in large tufts on old stumps. In\r\nsimilar localities, and also in tufts, but neither so large, nor so\r\ncommon, _Agaricus fusipes_ is found. It is preferable to the foregoing\r\nas an esculent, and is easily recognized by the spindle-shaped stem.\r\n\r\n_Agaricus rubescens_, P., belongs to a very suspicious group of\r\nfungi, in which the cap or pileus is commonly studded or sprinkled\r\nwith paler warts, the remains of an investing volva. To this group\r\nthe poisonous but splendid fly-agaric (_Agaricus muscarius_)\r\nbelongs. Notwithstanding its bad company, this agaric has a good\r\nreputation, especially for making ketchup; and Cordier reports it\r\nas one of the most delicate mushrooms of the Lorraine.[C] Its name\r\nis derived from its tendency to become red when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe white variety of an allied species (_Agaricus vaginatus_) has been\r\ncommended, and Dr. Badham says that it will be found inferior to but\r\nfew agarics in flavour.\r\n\r\nA scaly-capped fungus (_Agaricus procerus_), with a slender stem,\r\ncalled sometimes the parasol mushroom, from its habit, is an esteemed\r\nesculent. In Italy and France it is in high request, and is included\r\nin the majority of continental works on the edible fungi.[D] In\r\nAustria, Germany, and Spain, it has special \"vulgar\" names, and is\r\neaten in all these countries. It is much more collected in England\r\nthan formerly, but deserves to be still better known. When once seen\r\nit can scarcely be confounded with any other British species, save one\r\nof its nearest allies, which partakes of its own good qualities\r\n(_Agaricus rachodes_), though not quite so good.\r\n\r\n_Agaricus prunulus_, Scop., and _Agaricus orcella_, Badh., if they be\r\nnot forms of the same species (which Dr. Bull contends that they are\r\nnot[E]), have also a good reputation as esculents. They are both neat,\r\nwhite agarics, with a mealy odour, growing respectively in woods and\r\nopen glades. _Agaricus nebularis_, Batsch, is a much larger species,\r\nfound in woods, often in large gregarious patches amongst dead leaves,\r\nwith a smoky mouse-coloured pileus, and profuse white spores. It is\r\nsometimes as much as five or six inches in diameter, with rather a\r\nfaint odour and mild taste. On the continent, as well as in Britain,\r\nthis is included amongst edible fungi. Still larger and more imposing\r\nis the magnificent white species, _Agaricus maximus_, Fr.,[F] which is\r\nfigured by Sowerby,[G] under the name of _Agaricus giganteus_. It will\r\nattain a diameter of fourteen inches, with a stem, two inches thick,\r\nand rather a strong odour.\r\n\r\nA spring fungus, the true St. George's mushroom, _Agaricus gambosus_,\r\nFr., makes its appearance in pastures, usually growing in rings, in\r\nMay and June, and is welcome to mycophagists from its early growth,\r\nwhen esculent species are rare. It is highly esteemed in France and\r\nItaly, so that when dried it will realize as much as from twelve to\r\nfifteen shillings per pound. Guillarmod includes it amongst Swiss\r\nesculents.[H] Professor Buckman says that it is one of the earliest\r\nand best of English mushrooms, and others have endorsed his opinions,\r\nand Dr. Badham in writing of it observes, that small baskets of them,\r\nwhen they first appear in the spring in Italy, are sent as \"presents\r\nto lawyers and fees to medical men.\"\r\n\r\nThe closely allied species, _Agaricus albellus_,[I] D.C., has also the\r\nreputation of being edible, but it is so rare in England that this\r\nquality cannot be put to the test. The curious short-stemmed _Agaricus\r\nbrevipes_, Bull,[J] has a similar reputation.\r\n\r\nTwo singularly fragrant species are also included amongst the\r\nesculent. These are _Agaricus fragrans_, Sow., and _Agaricus odorus_,\r\nBull. Both have a sweet anise-like odour, which is persistent for a\r\nlong time. The former is pale tawny-coloured, nearly white, the latter\r\nof a dirty pale green. Both are white-spored, and although somewhat\r\nlocal, sufficient specimens of _Ag. odorus_ may be collected in the\r\nautumn for domestic use. We have the assurance of one who has often\r\nproved them that they constitute an exquisite dish.\r\n\r\nA clear ivory-white fungus, _Agaricus dealbatus_, of which a crisped\r\nvariety is occasionally found in great numbers, springing up on old\r\nmushroom beds in dense clusters, is very good eating, but rather\r\ndeficient in the delicate aroma of some other species. The typical\r\nform is not uncommon on the ground in fir plantations. A more robust\r\nand larger species, _Agaricus geotrupes_, Bull, found on the borders\r\nof woods, often forming rings, both in this country and in the United\r\nStates, as well as on the continent of Europe, is recognized as\r\nesculent.\r\n\r\nWe may add to these three or four other species, in which the stem is\r\nlateral, and sometimes nearly obsolete. The largest and most common is\r\nthe oyster mushroom (_Agaricus ostreatus_, Jacq.[K]), so universally\r\neaten, that it is included in almost every list and book on edible\r\nfungi; it is the most common species in Transylvania, tons of it\r\nsometimes appearing in the markets. It does not possess that delicate\r\nflavour which is found in many species, and although extolled by some\r\nbeyond its merits, it is nevertheless perfectly wholesome, and, when\r\nyoung and carefully cooked, not to be despised. It must not be\r\nconfounded with a very similar species (_Agaricus euosmus_, B.), with\r\nrosy spores, which is unpleasant. _Agaricus tessellatus_, Bull,\r\n_Agaricus pometi_, Fr., _Agaricus glandulosus_, Bull, are all allies\r\nof the foregoing, and recorded as edible in the United States,\r\nalthough not one of the three has hitherto been recorded as occurring\r\nin Great Britain. To these may also be added the following:--_Agaricus\r\nsalignus_,[L] Fr., which is rare in England, but not uncommon abroad\r\nand in the United States. In Austria it is commonly eaten. _Agaricus\r\nulmarius_,[M] Bull, is common on elm trunks, not only in Britain but\r\nalso in North America, and is by some preferred to the oyster\r\nmushroom. An allied species, _Agaricus fossulatus_, Cooke,[N] is found\r\non the Cabul Hills, where it is collected, dried, and forms an article\r\nof commerce with the plains. Another, but smaller species, is dried in\r\nthe air on strings passed through a hole in the short stem (_Agaricus\r\nsubocreatus_, Cooke), and sent, it is believed, from China to\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\nThe smallest species with which we have any acquaintance, that is\r\nedible, is the \"nail fungus\" (_Agaricus esculentus_,[O] Jacq.),\r\nscarcely exceeding one inch in diameter of the pileus, with a thin\r\nrooting stem. The taste in British specimens when raw is bitter and\r\nunpleasant, but it is clearly eaten in Austria, as its name testifies,\r\nand elsewhere in Europe. It is found in fir plantations in the spring,\r\nat which season it is collected from the fir woods around and sent to\r\nVienna, where it is only used for flavouring sauces under the name of\r\n\"Nagelschwämme.\"\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the group of true agarics, to which all hitherto\r\nenumerated belong, we must mention a few others of less importance,\r\nbut which are included amongst those good for food. Foremost of these\r\nis a really splendid orange species (_Agaricus cæsarius_, Scop.[P]),\r\nwhich belongs to the same subgenus as the very deleterious fly-agaric,\r\nand the scarcely less fatal _Agaricus vernus_, Bull. It is universally\r\neaten on the continent, but has hitherto never been found in Great\r\nBritain. In the same subgenus, _Agaricus strobiliformis_,[Q] Fr.,\r\nwhich is rare in this country, and probably also _Agaricus Ceciliæ_,\r\nB. & Br.[R] Besides these, _Agaricus excoriatus_, Schæff., _Agaricus\r\nmastoideus_, Fr., _Agaricus gracilentus_, Kromb., and _Agaricus\r\nholosericeus_, Fr.,[S] all belonging to the same subgenus as the\r\nparasol mushroom, more or less uncommon in England.\r\n\r\nAlthough the larger number of esculent agarics are white-spored, some\r\nfew, worthy of note, will be found in the other sections, and notably\r\namongst these the common mushroom and its congener the meadow, or\r\nhorse mushroom. In addition to those already enumerated, might be\r\nincluded also the _Agaricus pudicus_, Bull, which is certainly\r\nwholesome, as well as its ally, _Agaricus leochromus_, Cooke,[T] both\r\nof which have rusty spores.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Curtis,[U] in a letter to the Rev. M. J. Berkeley,\r\nenumerates several of the fungi which are edible amongst those found\r\nin the United States. Of these, he says, _Agaricus amygdalinus_,\r\nCurt., can scarcely be distinguished when cooked from the common\r\nmushroom. _Agaricus frumentaceus_, Bull, and three allied new species,\r\npeculiar to the United States, are commended. _Agaricus cæspitosus_,\r\nCurt., he says, is found in enormous quantities, a single cluster\r\ncontaining from fifty to one hundred stems, and might well be deemed a\r\nvaluable species in times of scarcity. It would not be highly esteemed\r\nwhere other and better species can be had, but it is generally\r\npreferred to _Agaricus melleus_, Fr. It is suitable for drying for\r\nwinter use. In the same communication, he observes that the imperial\r\n(_Agaricus cæsarius_, Scop.), grows in great quantities in oak\r\nforests, and may be obtained by the cart-load in its season; but to\r\nhis taste, and that of his family, it is the most unpalatable of\r\nfungi, nor could he find any of the most passionate mycophagists who\r\nwould avow that they liked it. There is a disagreeable saline flavour\r\nthat they could not remove nor overlay. In addition to these, the same\r\nauthority enumerates _Agaricus russula_, Schæff., _Agaricus\r\nhypopithyus_, Curt., and _Agaricus consociatus_, Curt., the latter two\r\nbeing confined to the United States; _Agaricus columbetta_, Fr., found\r\nin Britain, but not eaten, as well as _Agaricus radicatus_, Bull.\r\n_Agaricus bombycinus_, Schæff., and _Agaricus speciosus_, Fr., are\r\nfound in Britain, but by no means common; _Agaricus squarrosus_,\r\nMull., has always been regarded with great suspicion in this country,\r\nwhere it is by no means uncommon; _Agaricus cretaceus_, Fr., and\r\n_Agaricus sylvaticus_, Schæff., are close allies of the common\r\nmushroom.\r\n\r\nDr. Curtis says that hill and plain, mountain and valley, woods,\r\nfields, and pastures, swarm with a profusion of good nutritious fungi,\r\nwhich are allowed to decay where they spring up, because people do not\r\nknow how, or are afraid, to use them. By those of us who know their\r\nuse, their value was appreciated, as never before, during the late\r\nwar, when other food, especially meat, was scarce and dear. Then such\r\npersons as I have heard express a preference for mushrooms over meat\r\nhad generally no need to lack grateful food, as it was easily had for\r\nthe gathering, and within easy distance of their homes if living in\r\nthe country. Such was not always the case, however. I remember once,\r\nduring the gloomy period when there had been a protracted drought, and\r\nfleshy fungi were to be found only in damp shaded woods, and but few\r\neven there, I was unable to find enough of any one species for a meal,\r\nso, gathering of every kind, I brought home thirteen different kinds,\r\nhad them all cooked together in one grand _pot pourri_, and made an\r\nexcellent supper.\r\n\r\nOne important use to which several species of fungi can be applied, is\r\nthe manufacture of ketchup. For this purpose, not only is the\r\nmushroom, _Agaricus campestris_, and the horse mushroom, _Agaricus\r\narvensis_, available, but also _Agaricus rubescens_ is declared to be\r\nexcellent for the purpose, and a delicious, but pale, extract is to be\r\nobtained from _Marasmius oreades_. Other species, as _Coprinus\r\ncomatus_, and _Coprinus atramentarius_, are also available, together\r\nwith _Fistulina hepatica_, and _Morchella esculenta_. In some\r\ndistricts, when mushrooms are scarce, it is stated that almost any\r\nspecies that will yield a dark juice is without scruple mixed with the\r\ncommon mushroom, and it should seem without any bad consequence except\r\nthe deterioration of the ketchup.[V] There is an extensive manufacture\r\nof ketchup conducted at Lubbenham, near Market Harborough, but the\r\ngreat difficulty appears to be the prevention of decomposition.\r\nMessrs. Perkins receive tons of mushrooms from every part of the\r\nkingdom, and they find, even in the same species, an immense\r\ndifference in the quality and quantity of the produce. The price of\r\nmushrooms varies greatly with the season, ranging between one penny\r\nand sixpence per pound. Messrs. Perkins are very careful in their\r\nselection, but little discrimination is used by country manufacturers\r\non a small scale, who use such doubtful species as _Agaricus\r\nlacrymabundus_, with _Agaricus spadiceus_, and a host of allied\r\nspecies, which they characterize as nonpareils and champignons. In the\r\neastern counties _Agaricus arvensis_ has the preference for ketchup.\r\n\r\nThe generic distinctions between the genuine Agarics and some of the\r\nallied genera can hardly be appreciated by the non-botanical reader,\r\nbut we have nevertheless preferred grouping the edible species\r\ntogether in a somewhat botanical order; and, pursuing this plan, the\r\nnext species will be those of _Coprinus_, in which the gills are\r\ndeliquescent after the plant has arrived at maturity. The maned\r\nmushroom (_Coprinus comatus_, Fr.)[W] is the best of edible species in\r\nthis group. It is very common here by roadsides and other places, and\r\nwhilst still young and cylindrical, and the gills still whitish or\r\nwith a roseate tint, it is highly to be commended. Similar, but\r\nperhaps somewhat inferior, is _Coprinus atramentarius_, Fr.,[X]\r\nequally common about old stumps and on the naked soil. Both species\r\nare also found and eaten in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn _Cortinarius_, the veil is composed of arachnoid threads, and the\r\nspores are rusty. The number of edible species are few. Foremost is\r\nthe really handsome _Cortinarius violaeus_, Fr.,[Y] often nearly four\r\ninches in diameter, and of a beautiful violet colour; and the smaller\r\n_Cortinarius castaneus_, Fr.,[Z] scarcely exceeding an inch in\r\ndiameter, both being found in woods, and common alike to Britain and\r\nthe United States. _Cortinarius cinnamomeus_, Fr., is also a lover of\r\nwoods, and in northern latitudes is found inhabiting them everywhere.\r\nIt has a cinnamon-coloured pileus, with yellowish flesh, and its odour\r\nand flavour is said to partake of the same spice. In Germany it is\r\nheld in high esteem. _Cortinarius emodensis_, B., is eaten in Northern\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe small genus _Lepista_ of Smith, (which, however, is not adopted by\r\nFries in his now edition of the \"Epicrisis\") includes one esculent\r\nspecies in _Lepista personata_, the _Agaricus personatus_ of Fries.[a]\r\nIt is by no means uncommon in Northern Europe or America, frequently\r\ngrowing in large rings; the pileus is pallid, and the stem stained\r\nwith lilac. Formerly it was said to be sold in Covent Garden Market\r\nunder the name of \"blewits,\" but we have failed to see or hear of it\r\nduring many years in London.\r\n\r\nSmall fungi of ivory-whiteness are very common amongst grass on lawns\r\nin autumn. These are chiefly _Hygrophorus virgineus_, Fr.,[b] and\r\nalthough not much exceeding an inch in diameter, with a short stem,\r\nand wide decurrent gills, they are so plentiful in season that\r\nquantity soon compensates for the small size. Except that it is\r\noccasionally eaten in France, it does not enjoy much reputation\r\nabroad. A larger species, varying from buff to orange, _Hygrophorus\r\npratensis_, Fr.,[c] is scarcely less common in open pastures. This is\r\nvery gregarious in habit, often growing in tufts, or portions of\r\nrings. The pileus is fleshy in the centre, and the gills thick and\r\ndecurrent. In France, Germany, Bohemia, and Denmark, it is included\r\nwith esculent species. In addition may be mentioned _Hygrophorus\r\neburneus_, Fr., another white species, as also _Hygrophorus niveus_,\r\nFr., which grows in mossy pastures. _Paxillus involutus_, Fr.,[d]\r\nthough very common in Europe, is not eaten, yet it is included by Dr.\r\nCurtis with the esculent species of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe milky agarics, belonging to the genus _Lactarius_, are distinguished\r\nby the milky juice which is exuded when they are wounded. The spores\r\nare more or less globose, and rough or echinulate, at least in many\r\nspecies. The most notable esculent is _Lactarius deliciosus_, Fr.,[e] in\r\nwhich the milk is at first saffron-red, and afterwards greenish, the\r\nplant assuming a lurid greenish hue wherever bruised or broken.\r\nUniversal commendation seems to fall upon this species, writers\r\nvying with each other to say the best in its praise, and mycophagists\r\neverywhere endorsing the assumption of its name, declaring it to be\r\ndelicious. It is found in the markets of Paris, Berlin, Prague, and\r\nVienna, as we are informed, and in Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland,\r\nRussia, Belgium; in fact, in nearly all countries in Europe it is\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\nAnother esculent species, _Lactarius volemum_, Fr.,[f] has white milk,\r\nwhich is mild to the taste, whilst in deleterious species with white\r\nmilk it is pungent and acrid. This species has been celebrated from\r\nearly times, and is said to resemble lamb's kidney.\r\n\r\n_Lactarius piperatus_, Fr., is classed in England with dangerous,\r\nsometimes poisonous species, whereas the late Dr. Curtis, of North\r\nCarolina, has distinctly informed us that it is cooked and eaten\r\nin the United States, and that he has partaken of it. He includes\r\n_Lactarius insulsus_, Fr., and _Lactarius subdulcis_, Fr.,[g]\r\namongst esculent species; both are also found in this country, but\r\nnot reputed as edible; and _Lactarius angustissimus_, Lasch, which\r\nis not British. Species of _Lactarius_ seem to be eaten almost\r\nindiscriminately in Russia when preserved in vinegar and salt, in\r\nwhich condition they form an important item in the kinds of food\r\nallowed in their long fasts, some _Boleti_ in the dried state\r\nentering into the same category.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Russula_ in many respects resemble _Lactarii_ without\r\nmilk. Some of them are dangerous, and others esculent. Amongst the\r\nlatter may be enumerated _Russula heterophylla_, Fr., which is very\r\ncommon in woods. Vittadini pronounces it unsurpassed for fineness of\r\nflavour by even the notable _Amanita cæsarea_.[h] Roques gives also an\r\naccount in its favour as consumed in France. Both these authors give\r\nfavourable accounts of _Russula virescens_, P.,[i] which the peasants\r\nabout Milan are in the habit of putting over wood embers to toast, and\r\neating afterwards with a little salt. Unfortunately it is by no means\r\ncommon in England. A third species of _Russula_, with buff-yellow\r\ngills, is _Russula alutacea_, Fr., which is by no means to be\r\ndespised, notwithstanding that Dr. Badham has placed it amongst\r\nspecies to be avoided. Three or four others have also the merit of\r\nbeing harmless, and these recorded as esculent by some one or more\r\nmycological authors: _Russula lactea_, Fr., a white species, found\r\nalso in the United States; _Russula lepida_, Fr., a roseate species,\r\nfound also in lower Carolina, U.S.; and another reddish species,\r\n_Russula vesca_, Fr., as well as _Russula decolorans_, Fr. Whilst\r\nwriting of this genus, we may observe, by way of caution, that it\r\nincludes also one very noxious red species, _Russula emetica_, Fr.,\r\nwith white gills, with which some of the foregoing might be confounded\r\nby inexperienced persons.\r\n\r\nThe chantarelle _Cantharellus cibarius_, Fr., has a most charming and\r\nenticing appearance and odour. In colour, it is of a bright golden\r\nyellow, and its smell has been compared to that of ripe apricots. It\r\nis almost universally eaten in all countries where it is found,\r\nEngland excepted, where it is only to be met with at the \"Freemason's\r\nTavern\" on state occasions, and at the tables of pertinacious\r\nmycophagists.[j] Trattinnick says: \"Not only this same fungus never\r\ndid any one harm, but might even restore the dead.\"[k]\r\n\r\nThe fairy-ring champignon _Marasmius oreades_, Fr., though small, is\r\nplentiful, and one of the most delicious of edible fungi. It grows in\r\nexposed pastures, forming rings, or parts of rings. This champignon\r\npossesses the advantage of drying readily, and preserving its aroma\r\nfor a long time. We have often regretted that no persistent attempts\r\nand experiments have been made with the view of cultivating this\r\nexcellent and useful species. _Marasmius scorodonius_, Fr.,[l] a\r\nsmall, strong-scented, and in all respects inferior species, found on\r\nheaths and dry pastures, extending even to the United States, is\r\nconsumed in Germany, Austria, and other continental countries, where,\r\nperhaps its garlic odour has been one of its recommendations as an\r\ningredient in sauces. In this enumeration we have not exhausted all\r\nthe gill-bearing species which might be eaten, having included only\r\nthose which have some reputation as esculents, and of these more\r\nparticularly those found in Great Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Polyporei_, in which the gill plates are represented by\r\npores or tubes, fewer esculent species are to be met with than in the\r\n_Agaricini_, and the majority of these belong to the genus _Boletus_.\r\nWhilst in Vienna and Hanover, we were rather surprised to find\r\n_Boletus edulis_, Fr., cut into thin slices and dried, exposed for\r\nsale in almost every shop where meal, peas, and other farinaceous\r\nedibles were sold. This species is common enough in England, but as a\r\nrule it does not seem to please the English palate, whereas on the\r\ncontinent no fungus is more commonly eaten. This is believed to be the\r\nsuillus eaten by the ancient Romans,[m] who obtained it from Bithynia.\r\nThe modern Italians dry them on strings for winter use, and in\r\nHungary a soup is made from them when fresh. A more excellent species,\r\naccording to our judgment, is _Boletus æstivalis_, Fr.,[n] which\r\nappears in early summer, and has a peculiar nutty flavour when raw,\r\nreminding one more of a fresh mushroom. _Boletus scaber_, Fr.,[o] is\r\nalso common in Britain, as well as the continent, but does not enjoy\r\nso good a reputation as _B. edulis_. Krombholz says that _Boletus\r\nbovinus_, Fr., a gregarious species, found on heaths and in fir woods,\r\nis much sought after abroad as a dish, and is good when dried.\r\n_Boletus castaneus_, Fr.,[p] is a small species with a mild, pleasant\r\ntaste when raw, and very good when properly cooked. It is not\r\nuncommonly eaten on the continent. _Boletus chrysenteron_, Fr.,[q] and\r\n_Boletus subtomentosus_, Fr., are said to be very poor eating, and\r\nsome authors have considered them injurious; but Mr. W. G. Smith\r\nstates that he has on more than one occasion eaten the former, and\r\nTrattinnick states that the latter is eaten in Germany. The late Mr.\r\nSalter informed us that, when employed on the geological staff, he at\r\none time lived almost entirely on different species of Boleti, without\r\nusing much discrimination. Sir W. C. Trevelyan also informs us that he\r\nhas eaten _Boletus luridus_ without any unpleasant consequences, but\r\nwe confess that we should be sorry to repeat the experiment. Dr.\r\nBadham remarks that he has eaten _Boletus Grevillei_, B., _Boletus\r\nflavus_, With., and _Boletus granulatus_, L., the latter being\r\nrecognized also as edible abroad. Dr. Curtis experimented, in the\r\nUnited States, on _Boletus collinitus_, and although he professes not\r\nto be particularly fond of the Boleti, he recognizes it as esculent,\r\nand adds that it had been pronounced delicious by some to whom he had\r\nsent it. He also enumerates as edible _Boletus luteus_, Fr., _Boletus\r\nelegans_, Fr., _Boletus flavidus_, Fr., _Boletus versipellis_, Fr.,\r\n_Boletus leucomelas_, Tr., and _Boletus ovinus_, Sch. Two Italian\r\nspecies of _Polyporus_ must not be forgotten. These are _Polyporus\r\ntuberaster_, Pers., which is procured by watering the _pietra\r\nfunghaia_, or fungus stone, a kind of tufa, in which the mycelium is\r\nembedded. It is confined to Naples. The other species is _Polyporus\r\ncorylinus_, Mauri., procured artificially in Rome from charred stumps\r\nof the cob-nut tree.[r]\r\n\r\nOf true _Polyporus_, only two or three species have been regarded\r\nfavourably as esculents. These are--_Polyporus intybaceus_, Fr., which\r\nis of very large size, sometimes attaining as much as forty pounds;\r\n_Polyporus giganteus_, Fr., also very large, and leathery when old.\r\nBoth these species are natives of Britain. Only young and juicy\r\nspecimens must be selected for cooking. _Polyporus umbellatus_, Fr.,\r\nis stated by Fries to be esculent, but it is not found in Britain.\r\n_Polyporus squamosus_, Fr., has been also included; but Mrs. Hussey\r\nthinks that one might as well think of eating saddle-flaps. None of\r\nthese receive very much commendation. Dr. Curtis enumerates, amongst\r\nNorth American species, the _Polyporus cristatus_, Fr., _Polyporus\r\nporipes_, Fr., which, when raw, tastes like the best chestnuts or\r\nfilberts, but is rather too dry when cooked. _Polyporus Berkeleii_,\r\nFr., is intensely pungent when raw, but when young, and before the\r\npores are visible, it may be eaten with impunity, all its pungency\r\nbeing dissipated by cooking. _Polyporus confluens_, Fr., he considers\r\nsuperior, and, in fact, quite a favourite. _Polyporus sulfureus_, Fr.,\r\nwhich is not eaten in Europe, he considers just tolerably safe, but\r\nnot to be coveted. It is by no means to be recommended to persons with\r\nweak stomachs. In his catalogue, Dr. Curtis enumerates one hundred and\r\neleven species of edible fungi found in Carolina.[s]\r\n\r\nWith _Fistulina hepatica_, Fr., it is different; for here we encounter\r\na fleshy, juicy fungus, resembling beefsteak a little in appearance,\r\nand so much more in its uses, that the name of \"beefsteak fungus\" has\r\nbeen given to it. Some authors are rapturous in their praise of\r\n_Fistulina_. It sometimes attains a very large size, Dr. Badham\r\nquoting[t] one found by himself nearly five feet in circumference,\r\nand weighing eight pounds; whilst another found by Mr. Graves weighed\r\nnearly thirty pounds. In Vienna it is sliced and eaten with salad,\r\nlike beetroot, which it then much resembles. On the continent it is\r\neverywhere included amongst the best of edible species.\r\n\r\nThe _Hydnei_, instead of pores or tubes, are characterized by spines\r\nor warts, over which the fructifying surface is expanded. The most\r\ncommon is _Hydnum repandum_, Fr., found in woods and woody places in\r\nEngland, and on the continent, extending into the United States. When\r\nraw, it is peppery to the taste, but when cooked is much esteemed.\r\nFrom its drier nature, it can readily be dried for winter use. Less\r\ncommon in England is _Hydnum imbricatum_, Fr., although not so\r\nuncommon on the continent. It is eaten in Germany, Austria,\r\nSwitzerland, France, and elsewhere. _Hydnum lævigatum_, Swartz, is\r\neaten in Alpine districts.[u] Of the branched species, _Hydnum\r\ncoralloides_, Scop.,[v] and _Hydnum Caput Medusæ_, Bull,[w] are\r\nesculent, but very rare in England. The latter is not uncommon in\r\nAustria and Italy, the former in Germany, Switzerland, and France.\r\n_Hydnum erinaceum_, Bull, is eaten in Germany[x] and France.\r\n\r\nThe Clavarioid fungi are mostly small, but of these the majority of\r\nthe white-spored are edible. _Clavaria rugosa_, Bull, is a common\r\nBritish species, as also is _Clavaria coralloides_, L., the former\r\nbeing found also in the United States. _Clavaria fastigiata_, D. C.,\r\nis not uncommon; but _Clavaria amethystina_, Bull, a beautiful violet\r\nspecies, is rare. In France and Italy, _Clavaria cinerea_, Bull, is\r\nclassed with esculents; and it is not uncommon in Britain. _Clavaria\r\nbotrytis_, P., and _Clavaria aurea_, Schæff., are large and beautiful\r\nspecies, but rare with us; they extend also into the United States.\r\nOthers might be named (Dr. Curtis enumerates thirteen species eaten in\r\nCarolina), which are certainly wholesome, but they are of little\r\nimportance as edible species. _Sparassis crispa_, Fr., is, on the\r\ncontrary, very large, resembling in size,[y] and somewhat in\r\nappearance, a cauliflower; it has of late years been found several\r\ntimes in this country. In Austria it is fricasseed with butter and\r\nherbs.\r\n\r\nOf the true Tremellæ, none merit insertion here. The curious Jew's ear\r\n(_Hirneola auricula-Judæ_, Fr.), with one or two other species of\r\n_Hirneola_, are collected in great quantities in Tahiti, and shipped\r\nin a dried state to China, where they are used for soup. Some of these\r\nfind their way to Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe false truffles (_Hypogæi_) are of doubtful value, one species\r\n(_Melanogaster variegatus_, Tul.) having formerly been sold in the\r\nmarkets of Bath as a substitute for the genuine truffle.[z] Neither\r\namongst the _Phalloidei_ do we meet with species of any economic\r\nvalue. The gelatinous volva of a species of _Ileodictyon_ is eaten by\r\nthe New Zealanders, to whom it is known as thunder dirt; whilst that\r\nof _Phallus Mokusin_ is applied to a like purpose in China;[AA] but\r\nthese examples would not lead us to recommend a similar use for\r\n_Phallus impudicus_, Fr., in Britain, or induce us to prove the\r\nassertion of a Scotch friend that the porous stem is very good\r\neating.\r\n\r\nOne species of puff-ball, _Lycoperdon giganteum_, Fr,[AB] has many\r\nstaunch advocates, and whilst young and cream-like, it is, when well\r\nmanipulated, an excellent addition to the breakfast-table. A decided\r\nadvantage is possessed by this species, since one specimen is often\r\nfound large enough to satisfy the appetites of ten or twelve persons.\r\nOther species of _Lycoperdon_ have been eaten when young, and we have\r\nbeen assured by those who have made the experiment, that they are\r\nscarcely inferior to their larger congener. _Bovista nigrescens_, Fr.,\r\nand _Bovista plumbea_, Fr., are also eaten in the United States. More\r\nthan one species of _Lycoperdon_ and _Bovista_ appear in the bazaars\r\nof India, as at Secunderabad and Rangoon; while the white ant-hills,\r\ntogether with an excellent Agaric, produce one or more species of\r\n_Podaxon_ which are esculent when young. A species of _Scleroderma_\r\nwhich grows abundantly in sandy districts, is substituted for truffles\r\nin Perigord pies, of which, however, it does not possess any of the\r\naroma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--_Morchella gigaspora_, from Kashmir.]\r\n\r\nPassing over the rest of the sporiferous fungi, we find amongst the\r\n_Ascomycetous_ group several that are highly esteemed. Amongst these\r\nmay first be named the species of morel, which are regarded as\r\ndelicacies wherever they are found. _Morchella esculenta_, Pers., is\r\nthe most common species, but we have also _Morchella semilibera_, D.\r\nC., and the much larger _Morchella crassipes_, Pers. Probably all the\r\nspecies of _Morchella_ are esculent, and we know that many besides the\r\nabove are eaten in Europe and other places; _Morchella deliciosa_,\r\nFr., in Java; _Morchella bohemica_, Kromb., in Bohemia; _Morchella\r\ngigaspora_, Cooke, and _Morchella deliciosa_, Fr., in Kashmere.[AC]\r\n_Morchella rimosipes_, D. C., occurs in France and Bohemia;\r\n_Morchella Caroliniana_, Bosc., in the Southern United States of\r\nAmerica. W. G. Smith records the occurrence in Britain of specimens of\r\n_Morchella crassipes_, P., ten inches in height, and one specimen was\r\neleven inches high, with a diameter of seven and a half inches.[AD]\r\n\r\nSimilar in uses, though differing in appearance, are the species of\r\n_Helvella_, of which several are edible. In both these genera, the\r\nindividuals can be dried so readily that they are the more valuable on\r\nthat account, as they can be used for flavouring in winter when fresh\r\nspecimens of any kind of fungus are difficult to procure. The most\r\ncommon English species is _Helvella crispa_, Fr., but _Helvella\r\nlacunosa_, Fr., is declared to be equally good, though not so large\r\nand somewhat rare. _Helvella infula_, Fr., is also a large species,\r\nbut is not British, although it extends to North America, as also does\r\n_Helvella sulcata_, Afz. Intermediate between the morel and _Helvella_\r\nis the species which was formerly included with the latter, but now\r\nknown as _Gyromitra esculenta_, Fr.[AE] It is rarely found in Great\r\nBritain, but is more common on the continent, where it is held in\r\nesteem. A curious stipitate fungus, with a pileus like a hood, called\r\n_Verpa digitaliformis_, Pers.,[AF] is uncommon in England, but\r\nVittadini states that it is sold in the Italian markets, although only\r\nto be recommended when no other esculent fungus offers, which is\r\nsometimes the case in spring.[AG]\r\n\r\nTwo or three species of _Peziza_ have the reputation of being\r\nesculent, but they are of very little value; one of these is _Peziza\r\nacetabulum_, L., another is _Peziza cochleata_, Huds., and a third is\r\n_Peziza venosa_, Pers.[AH] The latter has the most decided nitrous\r\nodour, and also fungoid flavour, whilst the former seem to have but\r\nlittle to recommend them; we have seen whole baskets full of _Peziza\r\ncochleata_ gathered in Northamptonshire as a substitute for morels.\r\n\r\nA very interesting genus of edible fungi, growing on evergreen\r\nbeech trees in South America, has been named _Cyttaria_. One of\r\nthese, _Cyttaria Darwinii_, B., occurs in Terra del Fuego, where it\r\nwas found by Mr. C. Darwin[AI] growing in vast numbers, and\r\nforming a very essential article of food for the natives. Another is\r\n_Cyttaria Berteroi_, B., also seen by Mr. Darwin in Chili, and eaten\r\noccasionally, but apparently not so good as the preceding.[AJ] Another\r\nspecies is _Cyttaria Gunnii_, B., which abounds in Tasmania, and is\r\nheld in repute amongst the settlers for its esculent properties.[AK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--_Cyttaria Gunnii_, B.]\r\n\r\nIt remains for us only to note the subterranean fungi, of which the\r\ntruffle is the type, to complete our enumeration of esculent species.\r\nThe truffle which is consumed in England is _Tuber æstivum_, Vitt.;\r\nbut in France the more highly-flavoured _Tuber melanospermum_,\r\nVitt.,[AL] and also _Tuber magnatum_, Pico, with some other species.\r\nIn Italy they are very common, whilst some are found in Algeria. One\r\nspecies at least is recorded in the North-west of India, but in\r\nNorthern Europe and North America they appear to be rare, and\r\n_Terfezia Leonis_ is used as an esculent in Damascus. A large species\r\nof _Mylitta_, sometimes several inches in diameter, occurs plentifully\r\nin some parts of Australia. Although often included with fungi, the\r\ncurious production known under the name of _Pachyma cocos_, Fr., is\r\nnot a fungus, as proved by the examinations made by the Rev. M. J.\r\nBerkeley. It is eaten under the name of \"Tuckahoe\" in the United\r\nStates, and as it consists almost entirely of pectic acid, it is\r\nsometimes used in the manufacture of jelly.\r\n\r\nIn the Neilgherries (S. India), a substance is occasionally found\r\nwhich is allied to the native bread of southern latitudes. It is found\r\nat an elevation of 5,000 feet. The natives call it \"a little man's\r\nbread,\" in allusion to the tradition that the Neilgherries were once\r\npeopled by a race of dwarfs.[AM] At first it was supposed that these\r\nwere the bulbs of some orchid, but later another view was held of\r\ntheir character. Mr. Scott, who examined the specimens sent down to\r\nhim, remarks that, instead of being the product of orchids, it is that\r\nof an underground fungus of the genus _Mylitta_. It indeed seems, he\r\nsays, very closely allied to, if really distinct from, the so-called\r\nnative bread of Tasmania.[AN]\r\n\r\nOf the fungi employed in medicine, the first place must be assigned to\r\nergot, which is the sclerotioid condition of a species of _Claviceps_.\r\nIt occurs not only on rye but on wheat, and many of the wild grasses.\r\nOn account of its active principle, this fungus still holds its place\r\nin the Materia Medica. Others which formerly had a reputation are now\r\ndiscarded, as, for instance, the species of _Elaphomyces_; and\r\n_Polyporus officinalis_, Fr., which has been partly superseded as a\r\nstyptic by other substances, was formerly employed as a purgative. The\r\nripe spongy capillitium of the great puff-ball _Lycoperdon giganteum_,\r\nFr., has been used for similar purposes, and also recommended as an\r\nanodyne; indeed formidable surgical operations have been performed\r\nunder its influence, and it is frequently used as a narcotic in the\r\ntaking of honey. Langsdorf gives a curious account of its employment\r\nas a narcotic; and in a recent work on Kamtschatka it is said to\r\nobtain a very high price in that country. Dr. Porter Smith writes of\r\nits employment medicinally by the Chinese, but from his own specimens\r\nit is clearly a species of _Polysaccum_, which he has mistaken for\r\n_Lycoperdon_. In China several species are supposed to possess great\r\nvirtue, notably the _Torrubia sinensis_, Tul.,[AO] which is developed\r\non dead caterpillars; as it is, however, recommended to administer it\r\nas a stuffing to roast duck, we may be sceptical as to its own\r\nsanitary qualities. _Geaster hygrometricus_, Fr., we have also\r\ndetected amongst Chinese drugs, as also a species of _Polysaccum_, and\r\nthe small hard _Mylitta lapidescens_, Horn. In India, a large but\r\nimperfect fungus, named provisionally _Sclerotium stipitatum_, Curr.,\r\nfound in nests of the white ant, is supposed to possess great\r\nmedicinal virtues.[AP] A species of _Polyporus_ (_P. anthelminticus_,\r\nB.), which grows at the root of old bamboos, is employed in Burmah as\r\nan anthelmintic.[AQ] In former times the Jew's ear (_Hirneola auricula\r\nJudæ_, Fr.) was supposed to possess great virtues, which are now\r\ndiscredited. Yeast is still included amongst pharmaceutical\r\nsubstances, but could doubtless be very well dispensed with. Truffles\r\nare no longer regarded as aphrodisiacs.\r\n\r\nFor other uses, we can only allude to amadou, or German tinder, which\r\nis prepared in Northern Europe from _Polyporus fomentarius_, Fr., cut\r\nin slices, dried, and beaten until it is soft. This substance, besides\r\nbeing used as tinder, is made into warm caps, chest protectors, and\r\nother articles. This same, or an allied species of _Polyporus_,\r\nprobably _P. igniarius_, Fr., is dried and pounded as an ingredient in\r\nsnuff by the Ostyacks on the Obi. In Bohemia some of the large\r\nPolyporei, such as _P. igniarius_ and _P. fomentarius_, have the pores\r\nand part of the inner substance removed, and then the pileus is\r\nfastened in an inverted position to the wall, by the part where\r\noriginally it adhered to the wood. The cavity is then filled with\r\nmould, and the fungus is used, with good effect, instead of\r\nflower-pots, for the cultivation of such creeping plants as require\r\nbut little moisture.[AR]\r\n\r\nThe barren mycelioid condition of _Penicillium crustaceum_, Fr., is\r\nemployed in country districts for the domestic manufacture of vinegar\r\nfrom saccharine liquor, under the name of the \"vinegar plant.\" It is\r\nstated that _Polysaccum crassipes_, D. C.,[AS] is employed in the\r\nSouth of Europe to produce a yellow dye; whilst recently _Polyporus\r\nsulfureus_, Fr., has been recommended for a similar purpose. _Agaricus\r\nmuscarius_, Fr., the fly-agaric, known to be an active poison, is used\r\nin decoction in some parts of Europe for the destruction of flies and\r\nbugs. Probably _Helotium æruginosum_, Fr.,[AT] deserves mention here,\r\nbecause it stains the wood on which it grows, by means of its diffuse\r\nmycelium, of a beautiful green tint, and the wood thus stained is\r\nemployed for its colour in the manufacture of Tonbridge ware.\r\n\r\nThis completes the list, certainly of the most important, of the fungi\r\nwhich are of any direct use to humanity as food, medicine, or in the\r\narts. As compared with lichens, the advantage is certainly in favour\r\nof fungi; and even when compared with algæ, the balance appears in\r\ntheir favour. In fact, it may be questioned whether, after all, fungi\r\ndo not present a larger proportion of really useful species than any\r\nother of the cryptogams; and without any desire to disparage the\r\nelegance of ferns, the delicacy of mosses, the brilliancy of some\r\nalgæ, or the interest which attaches to lichens, it may be claimed for\r\nfungi that in real utility (not uncombined with injuries as real) they\r\nstand at the head of the cryptogams, and in closest alliance with the\r\nflowering plants.\r\n\r\n   [A] Badham, Dr. C.

The fact that fungi\r\nunder some conditions are luminous has long been known, since\r\nschoolboys in our juvenile days were in the habit of secreting\r\nfragments of rotten wood penetrated by mycelium, in order to exhibit\r\ntheir luminous properties in the dark, and thus astonish their more\r\nignorant or incredulous fellows Rumphius noted its appearance in\r\nAmboyna, and Fries, in his Observations, gives the name of _Thelephora\r\nphosphorea_ to a species of _Corticium_ now known as _Corticium\r\ncæruleum_, on account of its phosphorescence under certain conditions.\r\nThe same species is the _Auricularia phosphorea_ of Sowerby, but he\r\nmakes no note of its phosphorescence. Luminosity in fungi \"has been\r\nobserved in various parts of the world, and where the species has been\r\nfully developed it has been generally a species of _Agaricus_ which\r\nhas yielded the phenomenon.\"[A] One of the best-known species is the\r\n_Agaricus olearius_ of the South of Europe, which was examined by\r\nTulasne with especial view to its luminosity.[B] In his introductory\r\nremarks, he says that four species only of Agaricus that are luminous\r\nappear at present to be known. One of them, _A. olearius_, D. C., is\r\nindigenous to Central Europe; another, _A. igneus_, Rumph., comes from\r\nAmboyna; the third, _A. noctileucus_, Lév., has been discovered at\r\nManilla by Gaudichaud, in 1836; the last, _A. Gardneri_, Berk., is\r\nproduced in the Brazilian province of Goyaz, upon dead leaves. As to\r\nthe _Dematium violaceum_, Pers., the _Himantia candida_, Pers., cited\r\nonce by Link, and the _Thelephora cærulea_, D. C. _(Corticium\r\ncæruleum_, Fr.), Tulasne is of opinion that their phosphorescent\r\nproperties are still problematical; at least no recent observation\r\nconfirms them.\r\n\r\nThe phosphorescence of _A. olearius_, D. C., appears to have been\r\nfirst made known by De Candolle, but it seems that he was in error in\r\nstating that these phosphorescent properties manifest themselves only\r\nat the time of its decomposition. Fries, describing the _Cladosporium\r\numbrinum_, which lives upon the Agaric of the olive-tree, expressed\r\nthe opinion that the Agaric only owes its phosphorescence to the\r\npresence of the mould. This, however, Tulasne denies, for he writes,\r\n\"I have had the opportunity of observing that the Agaric of the olive\r\nis really phosphorescent of itself, and that it is not indebted to any\r\nforeign production for the light it emits.\" Like Delile, he considers\r\nthat the fungus is only phosphorescent up to the time when it ceases\r\nto grow; thus the light which it projects, one might say, is a\r\nmanifestation of its vegetation.\r\n\r\n\"It is an important fact,\" writes Tulasne, \"which I can confirm, and\r\nwhich it is important to insist upon, that the phosphorescence is not\r\nexclusively confined to the hymenial surface. Numerous observations\r\nmade by me prove that the whole of the substance of the fungus\r\nparticipates very frequently, if not always, in the faculty of shining\r\nin the dark. Among the first Agarics which I examined, I found many,\r\nthe stipe of which shed here and there a light as brilliant as the\r\nhymenium, and led me to think that it was due to the spores which had\r\nfallen on the surface of the stipe. Therefore, being in the dark, I\r\nscraped with my scalpel the luminous parts of the stipe, but it did\r\nnot sensibly diminish their brightness; then I split the stipe,\r\nbruised it, divided it into small fragments, and I found that the\r\nwhole of this mass, even in its deepest parts, enjoyed, in a similar\r\ndegree to its superficies, the property of light. I found, besides, a\r\nphosphorescence quite as brilliant in all the cap, for, having split\r\nit vertically in the form of plates, I found that the trama, when\r\nbruised, threw out a light equal to that of their fructiferous\r\nsurfaces, and there is really only the superior surface of the pileus,\r\nor its cuticle, which I have never seen luminous.\r\n\r\n\"As I have said, the Agaric of the olive-tree, which is itself\r\nvery yellow, reflects a strong brilliant light, and remains\r\nendowed with this remarkable faculty whilst it grows, or, at\r\nleast, while it appears to preserve an active life, and remains fresh.\r\nThe phosphorescence is at first, and more ordinarily, recognizable\r\nat the surface of the hymenium. I have seen a great number of young\r\nfungi which were very phosphorescent in the gills, but not in any\r\nother part. In another case, and amongst more aged fungi, the\r\nhymenium of which had ceased to give light, the stipe, on the\r\ncontrary, threw out a brilliant glare. Habitually, the phosphorescence\r\nis distributed in an unequal manner upon the stipe, and the same\r\nupon the gills. Although the stipe is luminous at its surface, it is\r\nnot always necessarily so in its interior substance, if one bruises\r\nit, but this substance frequently becomes phosphorescent after\r\ncontact with the air. Thus, I had irregularly split and slit a large\r\nstipe in its length, and I found the whole flesh obscure, whilst\r\non the exterior were some luminous places. I roughly joined the\r\nlacerated parts, and the following evening, on observing them\r\nanew, I found them all flashing a bright light. At another time, I\r\nhad with a scalpel split vertically many fungi in order to hasten\r\ntheir dessication; the evening of the same day, the surface of all\r\nthese cuts was phosphorescent, but in many of these pieces of fungi\r\nthe luminosity was limited to the cut surface which remained\r\nexposed to the air; the flesh beneath was unchanged.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen a stipe opened and lacerated irregularly, the whole of\r\nthe flesh of which remained phosphorescent during three consecutive\r\nevenings, but the brightness diminished in intensity from the exterior\r\nto the interior, so that on the third day it did not issue from the\r\ninner part of the stipe. The phosphorescence of the gills is in no way\r\nmodified at first by immersing the fungus in water; when they have\r\nbeen immersed they are as bright as in the air, but the fungi which I\r\nleft immersed until the next evening lost all their phosphorescence,\r\nand communicated to the water an already sensible yellow tint; alcohol\r\nput upon the phosphorescent gills did not at once completely\r\nobliterate the light, but visibly enfeebled it. As to the spores,\r\nwhich are white, I have found many times very dense coats of them\r\nthrown down on porcelain plates, but I have never seen them\r\nphosphorescent.\r\n\r\n\"As to the observation made by Delile that the Agaric of the olive\r\ndoes not shine during the day when placed in total darkness, I think\r\nthat it could not have been repeated. From what I have said of the\r\nphosphorescence of _A. olearius_, one naturally concludes that there\r\ndoes not exist any necessary relation between this phenomenon and the\r\nfructification of the fungus; the luminous brightness of the hymenium\r\nshows, says Delile, 'the greater activity of the reproductive organs,'\r\nbut it is not in consequence of its reproductive functions, which may\r\nbe judged only as an accessory phenomenon, the cause of which is\r\nindependent of, and more general than these functions, since all the\r\nparts of the fungus, its entire substance, throws forth at one time,\r\nor at successive times, light. From these experiments Tulasne infers\r\nthat the same agents, oxygen, water, and warmth, are perfectly\r\nnecessary to the production of phosphorescence as much in living\r\norganized beings as in those which have ceased to live. In either\r\ncase, the luminous phenomena accompany a chemical reaction which\r\nconsists principally in a combination of the organized matter with the\r\noxygen of the air; that is to say, in its combustion, and in the\r\ndischarge of carbonic acid which thus shows itself.\"\r\n\r\nWe have quoted at considerable length from these observations of\r\nTulasne on the Agaric of the olive, as they serve very much to\r\nillustrate similar manifestations in other species, which doubtless\r\nresemble each other in their main features.\r\n\r\nMr. Gardner has graphically described his first acquaintance in Brazil\r\nwith the phosphorescent species which now bears his name. It was\r\nencountered on a dark night of December, while passing through the\r\nstreets of Villa de Natividate. Some boys were amusing themselves\r\nwith some luminous object, which at first he supposed to be a kind of\r\nlarge fire-fly, but on making inquiry he found it to be a beautiful\r\nphosphorescent Agaric, which he was told grew abundantly in the\r\nneighbourhood on the decaying fronds of a dwarf palm. The whole plant\r\ngives out at night a bright light somewhat similar to that emitted by\r\nthe larger fire-flies, having a pale greenish hue. From this\r\ncircumstance, and from growing on a palm, it was called by the\r\ninhabitants \"flor de coco.\"[C]\r\n\r\nThe number of recognized phosphorescent species of _Agaricus_ is not\r\nlarge, although two or three others may be enumerated in addition to\r\nthose cited by Tulasne. Of these, _Agaricus lampas_, and some others,\r\nare found in Australia.[D] In addition to the _Agaricus noctileucus_,\r\ndiscovered by Gaudichaud, and the _Agaricus igneus_ of Rumphius, found\r\nin Amboyna, Dr. Hooker speaks of the phenomenon as common in Sikkim,\r\nbut he seems never to have been able to ascertain with what species it\r\nwas associated.\r\n\r\nDr. Cuthbert Collingwood has communicated some further information\r\nrelative to the luminosity of a species of _Agaricus_ in Borneo\r\n(supposed to be _A. Gardneri_), in which he says, \"The night being\r\ndark, the fungi could be very distinctly seen, though not at any great\r\ndistance, shining with a soft pale greenish light. Here and there\r\nspots of much more intense light were visible, and these proved to be\r\nvery young and minute specimens. The older specimens may more properly\r\nbe described as possessing a greenish luminous glow, like the glow of\r\nthe electric discharge, which, however, was quite sufficient to define\r\nits shape, and, when closely examined, the chief details of its form\r\nand appearance. The luminosity did not impart itself to the hand, and\r\ndid not appear to be affected by the separation from the root on which\r\nit grew, at least not for some hours. I think it probable that the\r\nmycelium of this fungus is also luminous, for, upon turning up the\r\nground in search of small luminous worms, minute spots of light were\r\nobserved, which could not be referred to any particular object or body\r\nwhen brought to the light and examined, and were probably due to some\r\nminute portions of its mycelium.\"[E] The same writer also adds, \"Mr.\r\nHugh Low has assured me that he saw the jungle all in a blaze of light\r\n(by which he could see to read) as, some years ago, he was riding\r\nacross the island by the jungle road; and that this luminosity was\r\nproduced by an Agaric.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar experiences were detailed by Mr. James Drummond in a letter\r\nfrom Swan River, in which two species of Agaric are concerned. They\r\ngrew on the stumps of trees, and had nothing remarkable in their\r\nappearance by day, but by night emitted a most curious light, such as\r\nthe writer never saw described in any book. One species was found\r\ngrowing on the stump of a _Banksia_ in Western Australia. The stump\r\nwas at the time surrounded by water. It was on a dark night, when\r\npassing, that the curious light was first observed. When the fungus\r\nwas laid on a newspaper, it emitted by night a phosphorescent light,\r\nenabling persons to read the words around it, and it continued to do\r\nso for several nights with gradually decreasing intensity as the plant\r\ndried up. In the other instance, which occurred some years after, the\r\nauthor, during one of his botanical trips, was struck by the\r\nappearance of a large Agaric, measuring sixteen inches in diameter,\r\nand weighing about five pounds. This specimen was hung up to dry in\r\nthe sitting-room, and on passing through the apartment in the dark it\r\nwas observed to give out the same remarkable light. The luminous\r\nproperty continued, though gradually diminishing, for four or five\r\nnights, when it ceased on the plant becoming dry. \"We called some of\r\nthe natives,\" he adds, \"and showed them this fungus when emitting\r\nlight, and the poor creatures cried out 'chinga,' their name for a\r\nspirit, and seemed much afraid of it.\"[F]\r\n\r\nAlthough the examples already cited are those of species of Agaric,\r\nluminosity is not by any means wholly confined to that genus. Mr.\r\nWorthington Smith has recorded his experiences of some specimens of\r\nthe common _Polyporus annosus_ which were found on some timbers in the\r\nCardiff coal mines. He remarks that the colliers are well acquainted\r\nwith phosphorescent fungi, and the men state that sufficient light is\r\ngiven \"to see their hands by.\" The specimens of _Polyporus_ were so\r\nluminous that they could be seen in the dark at a distance of twenty\r\nyards. He observes further, that he has met with specimens of\r\n_Polyporus sulfureus_ which were phosphorescent. Some of the fungi\r\nfound in mines, which emit light familiar to the miners, belong to the\r\nincomplete genus _Rhizomorpha_, of which Humboldt amongst others gives\r\na glowing account. Tulasne has also investigated this phenomenon in\r\nconnection with the common _Rhizomorpha subterranea_, Pers. This\r\nspecies extends underneath the soil in long strings, in the\r\nneighbourhood of old tree stumps, those of the oak especially, which\r\nare becoming rotten, and upon these it is fixed by one of its\r\nbranches. These are cylindrical, very flexible, branching, and clothed\r\nwith a hard bark, encrusting and fragile, at first smooth and brown,\r\nbecoming later very rough and black. The interior tissue, at first\r\nwhitish, afterwards of a more or less deep brown colour, is formed of\r\nextremely long parallel filaments from .0035 to .015 _mm._ in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day when I received the specimens,[G] he writes,\r\nthe temperature being about 22° Cent., all the young branches\r\nbrightened with an uniform phosphoric light the whole of their length;\r\nit was the same with the surface of some of the older branches, the\r\ngreater number of which were still brilliant in some parts, and only\r\non their surface. I split and lacerated many of these twigs, but their\r\ninternal substance remained dull. The next evening, on the contrary,\r\nthis substance, having been exposed to contact with the air, exhibited\r\nat its surface the same brightness as the bark of the branches. I made\r\nthis observation upon the old stalks as well as upon the young ones.\r\nProlonged friction of the luminous surfaces reduced the brightness\r\nand dried them to a certain degree, but did not leave on the fingers\r\nany phosphorescent matter. These parts continued with the same\r\nluminous intensity after holding them in the mouth so as to moisten\r\nthem with saliva; plunged into water, held to the flame of a candle so\r\nthat the heat they acquired was very appreciable to the touch, they\r\nstill emitted in the dark a feeble light; it was the same after being\r\nheld in water heated to 30° C.; but putting them in water bearing a\r\ntemperature of 55° C. extinguished them entirely. They are equally\r\nextinguished if held in the mouth until they catch the temperature;\r\nperhaps, still, it might be attributed less to the heat which is\r\ncommunicated to them than to the deficiency of sufficient oxygen,\r\nbecause I have seen some stalks, having become dull in the mouth,\r\nrecover after a few instants a little of their phosphorescence. A\r\nyoung stalk which had been split lengthwise, and the internal\r\nsubstance of which was very phosphorescent, could imbibe olive oil\r\nmany times and yet continue for a long time to give a feeble light. By\r\npreserving these _Rhizomorphæ_ in an adequate state of humidity, I\r\nhave been able for many evenings to renew the examination of their\r\nphosphorescence; the commencement of dessication, long before they\r\nreally perish, deprives them of the faculty of giving light. Those\r\nwhich had been dried for more than a month, when plunged into water,\r\ncommenced to vegetate anew and send forth numerous branches in a few\r\ndays; but I could only discover phosphorescence at the surface of\r\nthese new formations, or very rarely in their immediate neighbourhood,\r\nthe mother stalks appearing to have lost by dessication their luminous\r\nproperties, and did not recover them on being recalled to life. These\r\nobservations prove that what Schmitz has written was not true, that\r\nall parts of these fungi were seldom phosphorescent.\r\n\r\nThe luminous phenomenon in question is without doubt more complicated\r\nthan it appears, and the causes to which we attribute it are certainly\r\npowerfully modified by the general character of the objects in which\r\nthey reside. Most of the German botanists give this explanation,\r\nothers suppose that it forms at first or during its continuance a\r\nspecial matter, in which the luminous property resides; this matter,\r\nwhich is said to be mucilaginous in the luminous wood, appears to be\r\nin the _Rhizomorpha_ only a kind of chemical combination between the\r\nmembrane and some gummy substance which they contain. Notwithstanding\r\nthis opinion, I am assured that all external mucous matter was\r\ncompletely absent from the _Agaricus olearius_, and I neither\r\ndiscovered it upon the branches of _Rhizomorpha subterranea_ nor upon\r\nthe dead leaves which I have seen phosphorescent; in all these objects\r\nthe luminous surfaces were nothing else than their proper tissue.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked here that the so-called species of _Rhizomorpha_\r\nare imperfect fungi, being entirely devoid of fructification,\r\nconsisting in fact only of a vegetative system--a sort of compact\r\nmycelium--(probably of species of _Xylaria_) with some affinity to\r\n_Sclerotium_.\r\n\r\nRecently an extraordinary instance of luminosity was recorded as\r\noccurring in our own country.[H] \"A quantity of wood had been\r\npurchased in a neighbouring parish, which was dragged up a very steep\r\nhill to its destination. Amongst them was a log of larch or spruce, it\r\nis not quite certain which, 24 feet long and a foot in diameter. Some\r\nyoung friends happened to pass up the hill at night, and were\r\nsurprised to find the road scattered with luminous patches, which,\r\nwhen more closely examined, proved to be portions of bark or little\r\nfragments of wood. Following the track, they came to a blaze of white\r\nlight which was perfectly surprising. On examination, it appeared that\r\nthe whole of the inside of the bark of the log was covered with a\r\nwhite byssoid mycelium of a peculiarly strong smell, but unfortunately\r\nin such a state that the perfect form could not be ascertained. This\r\nwas luminous, but the light was by no means so bright as in those\r\nparts of the wood where the spawn had penetrated more deeply, and\r\nwhere it was so intense that the roughest treatment scarcely seemed to\r\ncheck it. If any attempt was made to rub off the luminous matter it\r\nonly shone the more brightly, and when wrapped up in five folds of\r\npaper the light penetrated through all the folds on either side as\r\nbrightly as if the specimen was exposed; when, again, the specimens\r\nwere placed in the pocket, the pocket when opened was a mass of light.\r\nThe luminosity had now been going on for three days. Unfortunately we\r\ndid not see it ourselves till the third day, when it had, possibly\r\nfrom a change in the state of electricity, been somewhat impaired; but\r\nit was still most interesting, and we have merely recorded what we\r\nobserved ourselves. It was almost possible to read the time on the\r\nface of a watch even in its less luminous condition. We do not for a\r\nmoment suppose that the mycelium is essentially luminous, but are\r\nrather inclined to believe that a peculiar concurrence of climatic\r\nconditions is necessary for the production of the phenomenon, which is\r\ncertainly one of great rarity. Observers as we have been of fungi in\r\ntheir native haunts for fifty years, it has never fallen to our lot to\r\nwitness a similar case before, though Prof. Churchill Babington once\r\nsent us specimens of luminous wood, which had, however, lost their\r\nluminosity before they arrived. It should be observed that the parts\r\nof the wood which were most luminous were not only deeply penetrated\r\nby the more delicate parts of the mycelium, but were those which were\r\nmost decomposed. It is probable, therefore, that this fact is an\r\nelement in the case as well as the presence of fungoid matter.\"\r\n\r\nIn all cases of phosphorescence recorded, the light emitted is\r\ndescribed as of the same character, varying only in intensity. It\r\nanswers well to the name applied to it, as it seems remarkably similar\r\nto the light emitted by some living insects and other animal\r\norganisms, as well as to that evolved, under favourable conditions, by\r\ndead animal matter--a pale bluish light, resembling that emitted by\r\nphosphorus as seen in a dark room.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon worthy of note is the change of colour which the\r\nbruised or cut surface of some fungi undergo. Most prominent amongst\r\nthese are certain poisonous species of _Boletus_, such, for instance,\r\nas _Boletus luridus_, and some others, which, on being bruised, cut,\r\nor divided, exhibit an intense, and in some cases vivid, blue. At\r\ntimes this change is so instantaneous that before the two freshly-cut\r\nportions of a _Boletus_ can be separated, it has already commenced,\r\nand proceeds rapidly till the depth of intensity has been gained.\r\nThis blue colour is so universally confined to dangerous species that\r\nit is given as a caution that all species which exhibit a blue colour\r\nwhen cut or bruised, should on no account be eaten. The degree of\r\nintensity varies considerably according to the condition of the\r\nspecies. For example, _Boletus cærulescens_ is sometimes only very\r\nslightly, if at all, tinged with blue when cut, though, as the name\r\nimplies, the peculiar phenomenon is generally highly developed. It\r\ncannot be said that this change of colour has as yet been fully\r\ninvestigated. One writer some time since suggested, if he did not\r\naffirm, that the colour was due to the presence of aniline, others\r\nhave contented themselves with the affirmation that it was a rapid\r\noxidization and chemical change, consequent upon exposure of the\r\nsurfaces to the air. Archdeacon Robinson examined this phenomenon in\r\ndifferent gases, and arrived at the conclusion that the change depends\r\non an alteration of molecular arrangement.[I]\r\n\r\nOne of the best of the edible species of _Lactarius_, known as\r\n_Lactarius deliciosus_, changes, wherever cut or bruised, to a dull\r\nlivid green. This fungus is filled with an orange milky fluid, which\r\nbecomes green on exposure to the air, and it is consequently the juice\r\nwhich oxidizes on exposure. Some varieties more than others of the\r\ncultivated mushroom become brownish on being cut, and a similar change\r\nwe have observed, though not recorded, in other species.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a milky juice in certain fungi has been alluded to.\r\nThis is by no means confined to the genus _Lactarius_, in which such\r\njuice is universal, sometimes white, sometimes yellow, and sometimes\r\ncolourless. In Agarics, especially in the subgenus _Mycena_, the gills\r\nand stem are replete with a milky juice. Also in some species of\r\n_Peziza_, as for instance in _Peziza succosa_, B., sometimes found\r\ngrowing on the ground in gardens, and in _Peziza saniosa_, Schrad.,\r\nalso a terrestrial species, the same phenomenon occurs. To this might\r\nbe added such species as _Stereum spadiceum_, Fr., and _Stereum\r\nsanguinolentum_, Fr., both of which become discoloured and bleeding\r\nwhen bruised, while _Corticium lactescens_ distils a watery milk.\r\n\r\nFungi in general have not a good repute for pleasant odours, and yet\r\nit must be conceded that they are not by any means devoid of odour,\r\nsometimes peculiar, often strong, and occasionally very offensive.\r\nThere is a peculiar odour common to a great many forms, which has come\r\nto be called a fungoid odour; it is the faint smell of a long-closed\r\ndamp cellar, an odour of mouldiness and decay, which often arises from\r\na process of eremocausis. But there are other, stronger, and equally\r\ndistinct odours, which, when once inhaled, are never to be forgotten.\r\nAmongst these is the fetid odour of the common stinkhorn, which is\r\nintensified in the more beautiful and curious _Clathrus_. It is very\r\nprobable that, after all, the odour of the _Phallus_ would not be so\r\nunpleasant if it were not so strong. It is not difficult to imagine,\r\nwhen one encounters a slight sniff borne on a passing breeze, that\r\nthere is the element of something not by any means unpleasant about\r\nthe odour when so diluted; yet it must be confessed that when carried\r\nin a vasculum, in a close carriage, or railway car, or exposed in a\r\nclose room, there is no scruple about pronouncing the odour intensely\r\nfetid. The experience of more than one artist, who has attempted the\r\ndelineation of _Clathrus_ from the life, is to the effect that the\r\nodour is unbearable even by an enthusiastic artist determined on\r\nmaking a sketch.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most fetid of fungi is _Thelephora palmata_. Some\r\nspecimens were on one occasion taken by Mr. Berkeley into his bedroom\r\nat Aboyne, when, after an hour or two, he was horrified at finding the\r\nscent far worse than that of any dissecting room. He was anxious to\r\nsave the specimens, but the scent was so powerful that it was quite\r\nintolerable till he had wrapped them in twelve thick folds of the\r\nstrongest brown paper. The scent of _Thelephora fastidiosa_ is bad\r\nenough, but, like that of _Coprinus picaceus_, it is probably derived\r\nfrom the imbibition of the ordure on which it is developed. There\r\nneeds no stronger evidence that the scent must not only be powerful,\r\nbut unpleasant, when an artist is compelled, before a rough sketch is\r\nmore than half finished, to throw it away, and seek relief in the open\r\nair. A great number of edible Agarics have the peculiar odour of\r\nfresh meal, but two species, _Agaricus odorus_ and _Agaricus\r\nfragrans_, have a pleasant anise-like odour. In two or three species\r\nof tough _Hydnum_, there is a strong persistent odour somewhat like\r\nmelilot or woodruffe, which does not pass away after the specimen has\r\nbeen dried for years. In some species of _Marasmius_, there is a\r\ndecidedly strong odour of garlic, and in one species of _Hygrophorus_,\r\nsuch a resemblance to that of the larva of the goat moth, that it\r\nbears the name of _Hygrophorus cossus_. Most of the fleshy forms\r\nexhale a strong nitrous odour during decay, but the most powerful we\r\nremember to have experienced was developed by a very large specimen of\r\n_Choiromyces meandriformis_, a gigantic subterranean species of the\r\ntruffle kind, and this specimen was four inches in diameter when\r\nfound, and then partially decayed. It was a most peculiar, but strong\r\nand unpleasantly pungent nitrous odour, such as we never remember to\r\nhave met with in any other substance. _Peziza venosa_ is remarkable\r\nwhen fresh for a strong scent like that of aquafortis.\r\n\r\nOf colour, fungi exhibit an almost endless variety, from white,\r\nthrough ochraceous, to all tints of brown until nearly black, or\r\nthrough sulphury yellow to reds of all shades, deepening into crimson,\r\nor passing by vinous tints into purplish black. These are the\r\npredominating gradations, but there are occasional blues and mineral\r\ngreens, passing into olive, but no pure or chlorophyllous green. The\r\nnearest approach to the latter is found in the hymenium of some\r\n_Boleti_. Some of the Agarics exhibit bright colours, but the larger\r\nnumber of bright-coloured species occur in the genus _Peziza_. Nothing\r\ncan be more elegant than the orange cups of _Peziza aurantia_, the\r\nglowing crimson of _Peziza coccinea_, the bright scarlet of _Peziza\r\nrutilans_, the snowy whiteness of _Peziza nivea_, the delicate yellow\r\nof _Peziza theleboloides_, or the velvety brown of _Peziza repanda_.\r\nAmongst Agarics, the most noble _Agaricus muscarius_, with its warty\r\ncrimson pileus, is scarcely eclipsed by the continental orange\r\n_Agaricus cæsarius_. The amethystine variety of _Agaricus laccatus_ is\r\nso common and yet so attractive; whilst some forms and species\r\n_Russula_ are gems of brilliant colouring. The golden tufts of more\r\nthan one species of _Clavaria_ are exceedingly attractive, and the\r\ndelicate pink of immature _Lycogala epidendrum_ is sure to command\r\nadmiration. The minute forms which require the microscope, as much to\r\nexhibit their colour as their structure, are not wanting in rich and\r\ndelicate tints, so that the colour-student would find much to charm\r\nhim, and good practice for his pencil in these much despised examples\r\nof low life.\r\n\r\nAmongst phenomena might be cursorily mentioned the peculiar sarcodioid\r\nmycelium of _Myxogastres_, the development of amoeboid forms from\r\ntheir spores, and the extraordinary rapidity of growth, as the\r\nwell-known instance of the _Reticularia_ which Schweinitz observed\r\nrunning over iron a few hours after it had been red hot. Mr. Berkeley\r\nhas observed that the creamy mycelium of _Lycogala_ will not revive\r\nafter it has become dry for a few hours, though so active before.\r\n\r\n   [A] M. J.

The largest spore is microscopic, and the smallest known\r\nscarcely visible under a magnifying power of 360 diameters. Taking\r\ninto account the large number of species of fungi, probably scarcely\r\nless numerous than all the flowering plants, and the immense number of\r\nspores which some of the individuals produce, they must be exceedingly\r\nplentiful and widely diffused, though from their minuteness not easy\r\nto be discerned. It has been attempted to estimate the number of\r\nspores which might be produced by one single plant of _Lycoperdon_,\r\nbut the number so far exceeds that which the mind is accustomed to\r\ncontemplate that it seems scarcely possible to realize their\r\nprofusion. Recent microscopic examinations of the common atmosphere[A]\r\nshow the large quantity of spores that are continually suspended. In\r\nthese investigations it was found that spores and similar cells were\r\nof constant occurrence, and were generally present in considerable\r\nnumbers. That the majority of the cells were living, and ready to\r\nundergo development on meeting with suitable conditions, was very\r\nmanifest, as in those cases in which preparations were retained under\r\nobservation for any length of time, germination rapidly took place in\r\nmany of the cells. In few instances did any development take place,\r\nbeyond the formation of networks of mycelium, or masses of toruloid\r\ncells, but, in one or two, distinct sporules were developed on the\r\nfilaments arising from some of the larger septate spores; and in a few\r\nothers, _Penicillium_ and _Aspergillus_ produced their characteristic\r\nheads of fructification. With regard to the precise nature of the\r\nspores, and other cells present in various instances, little can be\r\nsaid, as, unless their development were to be carefully followed out\r\nthrough all its stages, it is impossible to refer them to their\r\ncorrect species or even genera. The greater number of them are\r\napparently referable to the old orders of fungi, _Sphæronemei_,\r\n_Melanconei_, _Torulacei_, _Dematiei_ and _Mucedines_, while some\r\nprobably belonged to the _Pucciniæi_ and _Cæomacei_.\r\n\r\nHence it is demonstrated that a large number of the spores of fungi\r\nare constantly present in the atmosphere, which is confirmed by\r\nthe fact that whenever a suitable pabulum is exposed it is taken\r\npossession of by floating spores, and soon converted into a forest\r\nof fungoid vegetation. It is admitted that the spores of such\r\ncommon moulds as _Aspergillus_ and _Penicillium_ are so widely\r\ndiffused, that it is almost impossible to exclude them from closed\r\nvessels, or the most carefully guarded preparations. Special\r\ncontrivances for the dispersion of the spores in the different groups\r\nfollow a few general types, and it is only rarely that we meet with\r\nany method that is confined only to a species or genus. Some of\r\nthe more significant forms of spores may be illustrated, with their\r\nmodes of dissemination.\r\n\r\nBASIDIOSPORES is a term which we may employ here to designate all\r\nspores borne at the tips of such supports as are found in the\r\n_Hymenomycetes_ and _Gasteromycetes_, to which the name of basidia has\r\nbeen given. In fact, under this section we may include all the spores\r\nof those two orders, although we may be ignorant of the precise mode\r\nin which the fruit of most of the _Myxogastres_ is developed. Guarding\r\nourselves at the outset against any misinterpretation as to the use of\r\nthis term, which, in fact, we employ simply to designate the fruit of\r\n_Hymenomycetes_, we may have excuse in our desire to limit special\r\nterms as much as possible. In the _Agaricini_ the spores are\r\nplentiful, and are distributed over the hymenium or gill plates, the\r\nsurface of which is studded with basidia, each of which normally\r\nterminates with four short, erect, delicate, thread-like processes,\r\neach of which is surmounted by a spore. These spores are colourless or\r\ncoloured, and it is upon this fact that primary divisions in the genus\r\n_Agaricus_ are based, inasmuch as colour in the spores appears to be a\r\npermanent feature. In white-spored species the spores are white in all\r\nthe individuals, not mutable as the colour of the pileus, or the\r\ncorolla in phanerogamic plants. So also with the pink spored, rusty\r\nspored, black spored, and others. This may serve to explain why\r\ncolour, which is so little relied upon in classification amongst the\r\nhigher plants, should be introduced as an element of classification in\r\none of the largest genera of fungi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Spores of (_a_) _Agaricus mucidus_; (_b_)\r\n_Agaricus vaginatus_; (_c_) _Agaricus pascuus_; (_d_) _Agaricus\r\nnidorosus_; (_e_) _Agaricus campestris_. (Smith.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Spores of (_a_) _Lactarius blennius_; (_b_)\r\n_Lactarius fuliginosus_; (_c_) _Lactarius quietus_. (Smith.)]\r\n\r\nThere are considerable differences in size and form amongst the spores\r\nof the _Agaricini_, although at first globose; when mature they are\r\nglobose, oval, oblong, elliptic, fusiform, and either smooth or\r\ntuberculated, often maintaining in the different genera or subgenera\r\none particular characteristic, or typical form. It is unnecessary here\r\nto particularize all the modifications which the form and colour of\r\nthe spores undergo in different species, as this has already been\r\nalluded to. The spores in the _Polyporei_, _Hydnei_, &c., are less\r\nvariable, of a similar character, as in all the _Hymenomycetes_,\r\nexcept perhaps the _Tremellini_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46a.--(_a_) Spore of _Gomphidius viscidus;_ (_b_)\r\nspore of _Coprinus micaceus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Spores of (_a_) _Polyporus cæsius_; (_b_)\r\n_Boletus parasiticus_; (_c_) _Hydnum_.]\r\n\r\nWhen an Agaric is mature, if the stem is cut off close to the gills,\r\nand the pileus inverted, with the gills downwards on a sheet of black\r\npaper (one of the pale-spored species is best for this purpose), and\r\nleft for a few hours, or all night, in that position, the paper will\r\nbe found imprinted in the morning with a likeness of the under side of\r\nthe pileus with its radiating gills, the spores having been thrown\r\ndown upon the paper in such profusion, from the hymenium, and in\r\ngreater numbers from the opposed surfaces of the gills. This little\r\nexperiment will be instructive in two or three points. It will\r\nillustrate the facility with which the spores are disseminated, the\r\nimmense number in which they are produced, and the adaptability of the\r\ngill structure to the economy of space, and the development of the\r\nlargest number of basidiospores from a given surface. The tubes or\r\npores in _Polyporei_, the spines in _Hydnei_, are modifications of the\r\nsame principles, producing a like result.\r\n\r\nIn the _Gasteromycetes_ the spores are produced in many cases, probably\r\nin most, if not all, at the tips of sporophores; but the hymenium,\r\ninstead of being exposed, as in the _Hymenomycetes_, is enclosed within\r\nan outer peridium or sac, which is sometimes double. The majority of\r\nthese spores are globose in form, some of them extremely minute,\r\nvariously coloured, often dark, nearly black, and either externally\r\nsmooth or echinulate. In some genera, as _Enerthenema_, _Badhamia_,\r\n&c., a definite number of spores are at first enclosed in delicate\r\ncysts, but these are exceptions to the general rule: this also is the\r\ncase in at least one species of _Hymenogaster_. As the spores approach\r\nmaturity, it may be observed in such genera as _Stemonitis_, _Arcyria_,\r\n_Diachea_, _Dictydium_, _Cribraria_, _Trichia_, &c., that they are\r\naccompanied by a sort of reticulated skeleton of threads, which\r\nremain permanent, and served in earlier stages, doubtless, as\r\nsupports for the spores; being, in fact, the skeleton of the hymenium.\r\nIt has been suggested that the spiral character of the threads in\r\n_Trichia_ calls to mind the elaters in the _Hepaticæ_, and like them\r\nmay, by elasticity, aid in the dispersion of the spores. There is\r\nnothing known, however, which will warrant this view. When the spores\r\nare mature, the peridium ruptures either by an external orifice, as\r\nin _Geaster_, _Lycoperdon_, &c., or by an irregular opening, and the\r\nlight, minute, delicate, spores are disseminated by the slightest\r\nbreath of air. Specimens of _Geaster_ and _Bovista_ are easily\r\nseparated from the spot on which they grew; when rolling from place\r\nto place, the spores are deposited over a large surface. In the\r\n_Phalloidei_ the spores are involved in a slimy mucus which would\r\nprevent their diffusion in such a manner. This gelatinous substance has\r\nnevertheless a peculiar attraction for insects, and it is not altogether\r\nromantic to believe that in sucking up the fetid slime, they also\r\nimbibe the spores and transfer them from place to place, so that even\r\namongst fungi insects aid in the dissemination of species. Whether or\r\nnot the _Myxogastres_ should be included here is matter of opinion,\r\nsince the mode in which the spores are developed is but little known;\r\nanalogy with the _Trichogastres_ in other points alone leading to the\r\nconclusion that they may produce basidiospores. The slender, elastic\r\nstems which support the peridia in many species are undoubted aids to\r\nthe dissemination of the spores.[B]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--_Diachea elegans._]\r\n\r\nUnder the name of STYLOSPORES may be classed those spores which in some\r\norders of _Coniomycetes_ are produced at the apex of short threads,\r\neither enclosed in a perithecium, or seated upon a kind of stroma.\r\nThese are exceedingly variable, sometimes large, and multiseptate, at\r\nother times minute, resembling spermatia. In such genera as are\r\nchiefly epiphytal, in _Septoria_, _Phyllosticta_, and their allies,\r\nthe minute spores are enclosed within membranaceous perithecia, and\r\nwhen mature these are ejected from the orifice at the apex, or are\r\nexposed by the breaking off of the upper portion of the perithecia. In\r\n_Diplodia_ and _Hendersonia_ the spores are larger, mostly coloured,\r\noften very fine in the latter genus, and multiseptate, escaping from\r\nthe perithecia by a terminal pore. Probably the species are only\r\npycnidia of _Sphæriacei_, but that is of no consequence in relation\r\nto our present inquiry. Of stylospores which deserve mention on account\r\nof their singularity of form, we may note those of _Dilophospora\r\ngraminis_, which are straight, and have two or three hair-like\r\nappendages at each extremity. In _Discosia_ there is a single oblique\r\nbristle at each end, or at the side of the septate spores, whilst in\r\n_Neottiospora_ a tuft of delicate hairs is found at one extremity\r\nonly. The appendages in _Dinemasporium_ are similar to those of\r\n_Discosia_. The spores in _Prosthemium_ may be said in some sort to\r\nresemble compound _Hendersonia_, being fusiform and multiseptate, often\r\nunited at the base in a stellate manner. In this genus, as in\r\n_Darluca_, _Cytispora_, and the most of those belonging to the\r\n_Melanconiei_, the spores when mature are expelled from the orifice of\r\nthe perithecium or spurious perithecium, either in the form of\r\ntendrils, or in a pasty mass. In these instances the spores are more\r\nor less involved in gelatine, and when expelled lie spread over the\r\nmatrix, around the orifice; their ultimate diffusion being due to\r\nmoisture washing them over other parts of the same tree, since it is\r\nprobable that their natural area of dissemination is not large, the\r\nhigher plants, of which they are mostly conditions, being developed on\r\nthe same branches. More must be known of the relations between\r\n_Melanconium_ and Tulasne's sphæriaceous genus _Melanconis_ before\r\nwe can appreciate entirely the advantage to _Melanconium_ and some\r\nother genera, that the wide diffusion of their spores should be\r\nchecked by involving them in mucus, or their being agglutinated to the\r\nsurface of the matrix, only to be softened and diffused by rain. The\r\nspores in many species amongst the _Melanconiei_ are remarkably fine;\r\nthose of _Stegonosporium_ have the endochrome partite and cellular.\r\nIn _Stilbospora_ and _Coryneum_ the spores are multiseptate, large,\r\nand mostly coloured. In _Asterosporium_ the spores are stellate,\r\nwhilst in _Pestalozzia_ they are septate, with a permanent peduncle,\r\nand crested above with two or three hyaline appendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Spore of _Hendersonia polycystis_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Spores of _Dilophospora graminis_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Spores of _Discosia_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Spore of _Prosthemium betulinum_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Spore of _Stegonosporium cellulosum_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Stylospores of _Coryneum disciforme_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Spores of _Asterosporium Hoffmanni_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Spores of _Pestalozzia_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--_Bispora monilioides_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Torulacei_ externally, and to the naked eye, are very similar to\r\nthe black moulds, and the mode of dissemination will be alike in both.\r\nThe spores are chiefly compound, at first resembling septate threads,\r\nand at length breaking up into joints, each joint of which possesses\r\nthe function of a spore. In some instances the threads are connate,\r\nside by side, as in _Torula hysterioides_, and in _Speira_, being\r\nconcentrically arranged in laminæ in the latter genus. The structure\r\nin _Sporochisma_ is very peculiar, the joints breaking up within an\r\nexternal tube or membrane. The spores in _Sporidesmium_ appear to\r\nconsist of irregular masses of cells, agglomerated into a kind of\r\ncompound spore. Most of the species become pulverulent, and the spores\r\nare easily diffused through the air like an impalpable dust. They form\r\na sort of link between the stylospores of one section of the\r\n_Coniomycetes_, and the pseudospores of the parasitical section.\r\n\r\nPSEUDOSPORE is, perhaps, the most fitting name which can be applied to\r\nthe so-called spores of the parasitical _Coniomycetes_. Their peculiar\r\ngermination, and the production of reproductive bodies on the germ\r\ntubes, prove their analogy to some extent with the prothallus of other\r\ncryptogams, and necessitate the use of some term to distinguish them\r\nfrom such spores as are reproductive without the intervention of a\r\npromycelium. The differences between these pseudospores in the\r\nseveral genera are confined in some instances to their septation, in\r\nothers to their mode of development. In the _Æcidiacei_ the\r\npseudospores are more or less globose, produced in chains within an\r\nexternal cellular peridium. In the _Cæomacei_ they are simple,\r\nsometimes produced in chains, and sometimes free, with or without a\r\ncaduceous peduncle. In the _Ustilaginei_ they are simple, dark\r\ncoloured, and occasionally attached in subglobose masses, as in\r\n_Urocystis_ and _Thecaphora_, which, are more or less compact. In the\r\n_Pucciniæi_ the distinctive features of the genera are based upon the\r\nmore or less complex nature of the pseudospores, which are bilocular\r\nin _Puccinia_, trilocular in _Triphragmium_, multilocular in\r\n_Phragmidium_, &c. In the curious genus _Podisoma_ the septate\r\npseudospores are involved in a gelatinous element. The diffusion of\r\nthese fruits is more or less complete according to their compact or\r\npulverulent nature. In some species of _Puccinia_ the sori are so\r\ncompact that they remain attached to the leaves long after they are\r\ndead and fallen. In the genus _Melampsora_, the wedge-shaped\r\nwinter-pseudospores are not perfected until after the dead leaves have\r\nfor a long time remained and almost rotted on the ground. It is\r\nprobable that their ultimate diffusion is only accomplished by the\r\nrotting and disintegration of the matrix. In the _Cæomacei_,\r\n_Ustilaginei_, and _Æcidiacei_ the pseudospores are pulverulent, as in\r\nsome species of _Puccinia_, and are easily diffused by the motion of\r\nthe leaves in the wind, or the contact of passing bodies. Their\r\ndiffusion in the atmosphere seems to be much less than in the case of\r\nthe _Hyphomycetes_. By what means such a species as _Puccinia\r\nmalvacearum_, which has very compact sori, has become within so short\r\na period diffused over such a wide area, is a problem which in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge must remain unsolved. It may be through\r\nminute and plentiful secondary spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Pseudospores of _Thecaphora hyalina_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Pseudospores of _Puccinia_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Pseudospores of _Triphragmium_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Pseudospores of _Phragmidium bulbosum_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--_Melampsora salicina._ (Winter fruit.)]\r\n\r\nSPERMATIA are very minute delicate bodies found associated with many\r\nof the epiphyllous _Coniomycetes_, and it has been supposed are\r\nproduced in conjunction with some of the _Sphæriacei_, but their real\r\nfunction is at present obscure, and the name is applied rather upon\r\nconjecture than knowledge. It is by no means improbable that spermatia\r\ndo exist extensively amongst fungi, but we must wait in patience for\r\nthe history of their relationship.\r\n\r\nTRICHOSPORES might be applied better, perhaps, than _conidia_ to the\r\nspores which are produced on the threads of the _Hyphomycetes_. Some of\r\nthem are known to be the conidia of higher plants; but as this is by no\r\nmeans the case with all, it would be assuming too much to give the\r\nname of conidia to the whole. By whatever name they may be called, the\r\nspores of the _Hyphomycetes_ are of quite a different type from any yet\r\nmentioned, approximating, perhaps, most closely to the basidiospores\r\nof the _Hymenomycetes_ in some, and _Gasteromycetes_ in others; as,\r\nfor instance, in the _Sepedoniei_ and the _Trichodermacei_. The\r\nform of the spores and their size differ materially, as well as the\r\nmanner in which they are produced on the threads. In many they are\r\nvery minute and profuse, but larger and less plentiful in the\r\n_Dematiei_ than in the _Mucedines_. The spores of some species of\r\n_Helminthosporium_ are large and multiseptate, calling to mind the\r\nspores of the _Melanconiei_. Others are very curious, being stellate in\r\n_Triposporium_, circinate in _Helicoma_ and _Helicocoryne_, angular in\r\n_Gonatosporium_, and ciliate in _Menispora ciliata_. Some are produced\r\nsingly and some in chains, and in some the threads are nearly\r\nobsolete. In _Peronospora_, it has been demonstrated that certain\r\nspecies produce minute zoospores from the so-called spores. The\r\ndissemination of the minute spores of the _Mucedines_ through the\r\nair is undoubted; rain also certainly assists not only in the\r\ndispersion of the spores in this as in other groups, but also in the\r\nproduction of zoospores which require moisture for that purpose. The\r\nform of the threads, and the mode of attachment of the spores, is far\r\nmore variable amongst the _Mucedines_ than the form of the spores, but\r\nthe latter are in all instances so slightly attached to their supports\r\nas to be dissevered by the least motion. This aids also in the\r\ndiffusion of the spores through the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Spores of _Helicocoryne_.]\r\n\r\nSPORANGIA are produced in the _Physomycetes_ usually on the tips or\r\nbranches of delicate threads, and these when mature dehisce and set\r\nfree the minute sporidia. These are so small and uniform in their\r\ncharacter that they require but a passing mention. The method of\r\ndiffusion agrees much with that of the _Mucedines_, the walls of the\r\nsporangia being usually so thin and delicate as to be easily ruptured.\r\nOther modes of fructification prevail in some species by the\r\nproduction of cysts, which are the result of conjugation of the\r\nthreads. These bodies are for the most part furnished with thicker and\r\nmore resistant walls, and the diffusion of their contents will be\r\nregulated by other circumstances than those which influence the\r\ndispersion of the minute sporidia from the terminal cysts. Probably\r\nthey are more perennial in their character, and are assimilated more\r\nto the oogonia of _Cystopus_ and _Peronospora_, being rather of the\r\nnature of resting spores, inasmuch as the same threads usually bear\r\nthe terminal fruits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Sporidium of _Genea verrucosa_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Alveolate sporidium of _Tuber_.]\r\n\r\nTHECASPORES is a term which may be applied generally to all sporidia\r\nproduced in asci, but these are in turn so innumerable and variable\r\nthat it will be necessary to treat of some of the groups individually.\r\nThe _Thecaspores_, for instance, of the _Tuberacei_ offer several\r\nfeatures whereby they may be distinguished from other thecaspores. The\r\nasci in which these sporidia are generated mostly partake of a broadly\r\nsaccate, ovate form. The number of sporidia contained in an individual\r\nascus is usually less than in the majority of the _Ascomycetes_, and\r\nthe sporidia approximate more nearly to the globose form. Usually,\r\nalso, they are comparatively large. Many have been figured by Corda[C]\r\nand Tulasne.[D] Three types of spores may be said to prevail in the\r\n_Tuberacei_: the smooth spored, the warted or spinulose, and the\r\nareolate. The first of these may be represented by the _Stephensia\r\nbombycina_, in which the globose sporidia are quite smooth and\r\ncolourless. The warted sporidia may be observed in _Genea verrucosa_,\r\nthe spinulose in _Tuber nitidum_, and the areolate are present in\r\n_Tuber æstivum_ and _Tuber excavatum_, in which the epispore is\r\ndivided into polygonal alveoli, bounded by thin, membranaceous,\r\nprominent partitions. This form of sporidium is very beautiful. In all\r\nno special provision is made for the dissemination of the sporidia,\r\nas, from their subterranean habit, none would be available save the\r\nultimate dissolution of the external integuments. As they are greedily\r\ndevoured by several animals, it is possible that they may be dispersed\r\nthrough the excrements.\r\n\r\nIn the _Perisporiacei_ the perithecium has no proper orifice, or\r\nostiolum, for the discharge of the mature sporidia, which are usually\r\nsmall, and are disseminated by the irregular rupture of the somewhat\r\nfragile conceptacles. The asci are usually more or less saccate, and\r\nthe sporidia approximate to a globose form. The asci are often very\r\ndiffluent. In _Perisporium vulgare_ the ovate brown sporidia are at\r\nfirst, and for some time, attached together in fours in a concatenate\r\nor beaded manner. In some species of _Erysiphei_ the conceptacle\r\nencloses but a single sporangium, in others several, which are\r\nattached together at the base. In some species the sporangia contain\r\ntwo, in others four, in others eight, and in others numerous sporidia.\r\nIn _Chætomium_ the asci are cylindrical, and in most cases the\r\ncoloured sporidia are lemon-shaped. When the conceptacles are fully\r\nmatured, it is commonly the case that the asci are absorbed and the\r\nsporidia are free in the interior of the conceptacles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Asci, sporidia, and paraphyses of _Ascobolus_\r\n(Boudier).]\r\n\r\nOf the fleshy _Discomycetes_ the genus _Peziza_ may be taken as\r\nthe type. If the structure which prevails in this genus be brought\r\nto mind, it will be remembered that the hymenium lines an expanded\r\ncup, and that the asci are packed together, side by side, with their\r\napices outwards, and their bases attached to a substratum of cells\r\nwhich form the inner layer of the receptacle. The sporidia are\r\nusually eight in each ascus, either arranged in single or double\r\nrows, or irregularly grouped together. The asci are produced in\r\nsuccession; the later, pressing themselves upwards between those\r\npreviously developed, cause the rupture of the mature asci at the\r\napex and the ejection of the sporidia with considerable force. When\r\na large _Peziza_ is observed for a time a whitish cloud will be seen\r\nto rise suddenly from the surface of the disc, which is repeated again\r\nand again whenever the specimen is moved. This cloud consists of\r\nsporidia ejected simultaneously from several asci. Sometimes the\r\nejected sporidia lie like frost on the surface of the disc.\r\nTheories have been devised to account for this sudden extrusion of the\r\nsporidia, in _Ascobolus_, and a few species of _Peziza_, of the asci\r\nalso, the most feasible one being the successive growth of the\r\nasci; contraction of the cup may also assist, as well as some other\r\nless potent causes. It may be remarked here that the sporidia in\r\n_Peziza_ and _Helotium_ are mostly colourless, whilst in _Ascobolus_\r\nthey pass through pink to violet, or dark brown, and the epispore,\r\nwhich is of a waxy nature, becomes fissured in a more or less\r\nreticulated manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Sporidium of _Ostreichnion Americanum_.]\r\n\r\nThe sporidia in _Hysterium_ proper are usually coloured, often\r\nmultiseptate, sometimes fenestrate, and occasionally of considerable\r\nsize. There is no evidence that the sporidia are ever excluded in the\r\nsame manner as in _Peziza_, the lips closing over the disc so much as\r\nto prevent this. The diffusion of the sporidia probably depends on the\r\ndissolution of the asci, and hence they will not be widely dispersed,\r\nunless, perhaps, by the action of rain.\r\n\r\nIn _Tympanis_, asci of two kinds have been observed in some species;\r\none kind containing an indefinite number of very minute bodies\r\nresembling spermatia, and the other octosporous, containing sporidia\r\nof the usual type.\r\n\r\nThe _Sphæriacei_ include an almost infinite variety in the form and\r\ncharacter of the sporidia. Some of these are indefinite in the number\r\ncontained in an ascus, although the majority are eight, and a few\r\nless. In the genera _Torrubia_ and _Hypocrea_ the structure differs\r\nsomewhat from other groups, inasmuch as in the former the long\r\nthread-like sporidia break up into short joints, and in the latter the\r\nascus contains sixteen subglobose or subquadrate sporidia. Other\r\nspecies contain linear sporidia, which are often the length of the\r\nascus, and may either be simple or septate. In _Sphæria ulnaspora_ the\r\nsporidia are abruptly bent at the second joint. Shorter fusiform\r\nsporidia are by no means uncommon, varying in the number of septa, and\r\nin constriction at the joints in different species. Elliptic or ovate\r\nsporidia are common, as are those of the peculiar form which may be\r\ntermed sausage-shaped. These are either hyaline or coloured of some\r\nshade of brown. Coloured sporidia of this kind are common in _Xylaria_\r\nand _Hypoxylon_, as well as in certain species of the section\r\n_Superficiales_. Coloured sporidia are often large and beautiful: they\r\nare mostly of an elongated, elliptical form, or fusiform. As\r\nnoteworthy may be mentioned the sporidia of _Melanconis lanciformis_,\r\nthose of _Valsa profusa_, and some species of _Massaria_, the latter\r\nbeing at first invested with a hyaline coat. Some coloured sporidia\r\nhave hyaline appendages at each extremity, as in _Melanconis\r\nBerkeleii_, and an allied species, _Melanconis bicornis_, from the\r\nUnited States, also some dung _Sphæriæ_, as _S. fimiseda_, included\r\nunder the proposed genus _Sordaria_.[E] Hyaline sporidia occasionally\r\nexhibit a delicate bristle-like appendage at each extremity, as in the\r\n_Valsa thelebola_, or with two additional cilia at the central\r\nconstriction, as in _Valsa taleola_. A peculiar form of sporidium is\r\npresent in certain species of _Sphæria_ found on dung, for which the\r\ngeneric name of _Sporormia_ has been proposed, in which the sporidium\r\n(as in _Perisporium vulgare_) consists of four coloured ovate joints,\r\nwhich ultimately separate. Multiseptate fenestrate sporidia are not\r\nuncommon in _Cucurbitaria_ and _Pleospora_, as well as in _Valsa\r\nfenestrata_ and some other species. In the North American _Sphæria\r\nputaminum_ the sporidia are extraordinarily large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Ascus and sporidia of _Hypocrea_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Sporidium of _Sphæria ulnaspora_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Sporidia of _Valsa profusa_ (Currey).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Sporidia of _Massaria foedans_. × 400.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Sporidium of _Melanconis bicornis_, Cooke.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Caudate sporidia of _Sphæria fimiseda_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Sporidia of _Valsa thelebola_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Sporidia of _Valsa taleola_. × 400.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Sporidium of _Sporormia intermedia_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Asci and sporidia of _Sphæria_ (_Pleospora_)\r\n_herbarum_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Sporidium of _Sphæria putaminum_. × 400.]\r\n\r\nThe dissemination of the sporidia may, from identity of structure in\r\nthe perithecium, be deemed to follow a like method in all. When\r\nmature, they are in a great measure expelled from the mouth of the\r\nperithecia, as is evident in species with large dark sporidia, such as\r\nexist in the genera _Hypoxylon_, _Melanconis_, and _Massaria_. In\r\nthese genera the sporidia, on maturity, may be observed blackening the\r\nmatrix round the mouths of the perithecia. As moisture has an evident\r\neffect in producing an expulsion of sporidia by swelling the\r\ngelatinous nucleus, it may be assumed that this is one of the causes\r\nof expulsion, and therefore of aids to dissemination. When _Sphæriæ_\r\nare submitted to extra moisture, either by placing the twig which\r\nbears them on damp sand, or dipping one end in a vessel of water, the\r\nsporidia will exude and form a gelatinous bead at the orifice. There\r\nmay be other methods, and possibly the successive production of new\r\nasci may also be one, and the increase in bulk by growth of the\r\nsporidia another; but of this the evidence is scanty.\r\n\r\nFinally, OOGONIA may be mentioned as occurring in such genera as\r\n_Peronospora_ amongst moulds, _Cystopus_ amongst Uredines, and the\r\n_Saprolegniaceæ_ amongst the _Physomycetes_. The zoospores being\r\nfurnished with vibratile cilia, are for some time active, and need\r\nonly water in which to disseminate themselves, and this is furnished\r\nby rain.\r\n\r\nWe have briefly indicated the characteristics of some of the more\r\nimportant types of spores to be found in fungi, and some of the\r\nmodes by which it is known, or presumed, that their dissemination\r\ntakes place. In this summary we have been compelled to rest content\r\nwith suggestions, since an exhaustive essay would have occupied\r\nconsiderable space. The variability in the fruit of fungi, in so far\r\nas we have failed to demonstrate, will be found exhibited in the\r\nillustrated works devoted more especially to the minute species.[F]\r\n\r\n   [A] Cunningham, in \"Ninth Annual Report of the Sanitary Commissioner\r\n       with the Government of India.\" Calcutta, 1872.\r\n\r\n   [B] See \"Corda Icones,\" tab. 2.\r\n\r\n   [C] Corda, \"Icones Fungorum,\" vol. vi.

It may be\r\nassumed that the reader, having followed us to this point, is\r\nprepared for our observations by some knowledge of the chief features\r\nof structure in the principal groups, and of the main distinctions\r\nin the classification, or at least sufficient to obviate any\r\nrepetition here. In very many species it is by no means difficult to\r\ninduce germination of the spores, whilst in others success is by no\r\nmeans certain.\r\n\r\nM. de Seynes made the _Hymenomycetes_ an especial object of study,[A]\r\nbut he can give us no information on the germination and growth of the\r\nspore. Hitherto almost nothing is positively known. As to the form of\r\nthe spore, it is always at first spherical, which it retains for a\r\nlong time, while attached to the basidia, and in some species, but\r\nrarely, this form is final, as in _Ag. terreus_, &c. The most usual\r\nform is either ovoid or regularly elliptic. All the _Coprini_ have the\r\nspores oval, ovoid, more or less elongated or attenuated from the\r\nhilum, which is more translucent than the rest of the spore. This last\r\nform is rather general amongst the Leucospores, in _Amanita_,\r\n_Lepiota_, &c. At other times the spores are fusiform, with regularly\r\nattenuated extremities, as in _Ag. ermineus_, Fr., or with obtuse\r\nextremities, as in _Ag. rutilans_, Sch. In _Hygrophorus_ they are\r\nrather irregular, reniform, or compressed in the centre all round.\r\nHoffmann[B] has given a figure taken from _Ag. chlorophanus_, and\r\nSeynes verified it upon _Ag. ceraceus_, Sow. (See figures on page\r\n121.)\r\n\r\nThe exospore is sometimes roughened, with more or less projecting\r\nwarts, as may be seen in _Russula_, which much resembles _Lactarius_\r\nin this as in some other particulars. The spores of the _Dermini_ and\r\nthe _Hyporhodii_ often differ much from the sphærical form. In _Ag.\r\npluteus_, Fr., and _Ag. phaiocephalus_, Bull, there is already a\r\ncommencement of the polygonal form, but the angles are much rounded.\r\nIt is in _Ag. sericeus_, _Ag. rubellus_, &c., that the polygonal form\r\nbecomes most distinct. In _Dermini_ the angles are more or less\r\npronounced, and become rather acute in _Ag. murinus_, Sow., and _Ag.\r\nramosus_, Bull. The passage from one to the other may be seen in the\r\nstellate form of the conidia of _Nyctalis_.\r\n\r\nIt is almost always the external membrane that is coloured, which is\r\nsubject to as much variation as the form. The more fine and more delicate\r\nshades are of rose, yellow-dun or yellow, violet, ashy-grey, clear\r\nfawn colour, yellow-orange, olive-green, brick-red, cinnamon-brown,\r\nreddish-brown, up to sepia-black and other combinations. It is only by\r\nthe microscope and transparency that one can make sure of these tints;\r\nupon a sufficient quantity of agglomerated spores the colour may be\r\ndistinguished by the naked eye. Colour, which has only a slight\r\nimportance when considered in connection with other organs, acquires\r\nmuch in the spores, as a basis of classification.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of Agarics from the mycelium, or spawn, we are not\r\ndeficient in information, but what are the conditions necessary to\r\ncause the spores themselves to germinate before our eyes and produce\r\nthis mycelium is but too obscure. In the cultivated species we proceed\r\non the assumption that the spores have passed a period of probation in\r\nthe intestines of the horse, and by this process have acquired a\r\ngerminating power, so that when expelled we have only to collect them,\r\nand the excrement in which they are concealed, and we shall secure a\r\ncrop.[C] As to other species, we know that hitherto all attempts to\r\nsolve the mystery of germination and cultivation has failed. There are\r\nseveral species which it would be most desirable to cultivate if the\r\nconditions could be discovered which are essential to germination.[D]\r\nIn the same manner the _Boleti_ and _Hydnei_--in fact, all other\r\nhymenomycetal fungi, with the exception of the _Tremellini_--still\r\nrequire to be interrogated by persevering experiment and close inquiry\r\nas to their mode of germination, but more especially as to the\r\nessential conditions under which alone a fruitful mycelium is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--(_a_) Basidia and spores of _Exidia spiculosa_;\r\n(_b_) Germinating spore.]\r\n\r\nThe germination of the spore has been observed in some of the\r\n_Tremellini_. Tulasne described it in _Tremella violacea_.[E] These\r\nspores are white, unilocular, and filled with a plastic matter of\r\nhomogeneous appearance. From some portion of their surface an\r\nelongated germ filament is produced, into which the contents of the\r\nreproductive cell pass until quite exhausted. Other spores, perhaps\r\nmore abundant, have a very different kind of vegetation. From their\r\nconvex side, more rarely from the outer edge, these particular spores\r\nemit a conical process, generally shorter than themselves, and\r\ndirected perpendicularly to the axis of their figure. This appendage\r\nbecomes filled with protoplasm at the expense of the spore, and its\r\nfree and pointed extremity finally dilated into a sac, at first\r\nglobose and empty. This afterwards admits into its cavity the plastic\r\nmatter contained in its support, and, increasing, takes exactly the\r\nform of a new spore, without, however, quite equalling in size the\r\nprimary or mother spore. The spore of the new formation long retains\r\nits pedicel, and the mother spore which produced it, but these latter\r\norgans are then entirely empty and extremely transparent. Sometimes\r\ntwo secondary spores are thus engendered from the same spore, and\r\ntheir pedicels may be implanted on the same or on different sides, so\r\nas to be parallel in the former case, and growing in opposite\r\ndirections in the latter. The fate of these secondary spores was not\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Germinating spore and (_a_) corpuscles of\r\n_Dacrymyces deliquescens_.]\r\n\r\nIn _Dacrymyces deliquescens_ are found mingled amongst the spores\r\nimmense numbers of small round or ovoid unilocular bodies, without\r\nappendages of any kind, which long puzzled mycologists. Tulasne\r\nascertained that they are derived from the spores of this fungus when\r\nthey have become free, and rest on the surface of the hymenium. Each\r\nof the cells of the spore emits exteriorly one or several of these\r\ncorpuscles, supported on very short slender pedicels, which remain\r\nafter the corpuscles are detached from them. This latter circumstance\r\nevidences that new corpuscles succeed the firstborn one on each\r\npedicel as long as there remains any plastic matter within the spore.\r\nThe latter, in fact, in consequence of this labour of production,\r\nbecomes gradually emptied, and yet preserves the generative pedicels\r\nof the corpuscles, even when it no longer contains any solid or\r\ncoloured matter. These pedicels are not all in the same plane, as may\r\nbe ascertained by turning the spore on its longitudinal axis; but it\r\noften seems to be so when they are looked at in profile, on account of\r\nthe very slight distance which then separates them one from another.\r\nIt will also be remarked that they are in this case often implanted\r\nall on the same side of the reproductive body, and most often on its\r\nconvex side. Their fecundity is exhausted with the plastic contents of\r\nthe spore. The corpuscles, when placed in the most favourable\r\nconditions, have never given the least sign of vegetation; they have\r\nalso remained for a long time in water without experiencing any\r\nappreciable alteration.\r\n\r\nAll the individuals of _Dacrymyces deliquescens_ do not produce these\r\ncorpuscles in the same abundance; those which bear the most are\r\nrecognizable by the pale tint of the reproductive dust with which they\r\nare covered; in others, where this dust preserves its golden\r\nappearance, only a few corpuscles are found. The spores which produce\r\ncorpuscles do not appear at all apt to germinate. On the other hand,\r\nmultitudes of spores will germinate which had not produced any\r\ncorpuscles. Tulasne remarks on this, that these observations would\r\nauthorize us to think that all spores, though perfectly identical to\r\nour eyes, have not, without distinction, the same fate, nor doubtless\r\nthe same nature; and, in the second place, that these two kinds of\r\nbodies, if they are not always isolated, yet are most frequently met\r\nwith on distinct individuals. This author claims for the corpuscles in\r\nquestion that they are spermatia, and thinks that their origin is only\r\nso far unusual in that they proceed from veritable spores.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the _Gasteromycetes_ have as yet to be challenged as to\r\nthe mode and conditions of germination and development. It is probable\r\nthat these will not materially differ from those which prevail in\r\n_Hymenomycetes_.\r\n\r\nThe germination in _Æcidium_ has been followed out by Tulasne,[F]\r\neither by placing the pseudospores in a drop of water, or confining\r\nthem in a moist atmosphere, or by placing the leaves on which the\r\n_Æcidium_ flourishes upon water. The pseudospores plunged in water\r\ngerminated more readily than the others. If the conditions were\r\nfavourable, germination would take place in a few hours. _Æcidium\r\nRanunculacearum_, D. C., on leaves of figwort, gives rarely more than\r\none germinating filament, which soon attains three times the length of\r\nthe diameter of the pseudospore. This filament generally remains\r\nsimple, sometimes torulose, and distorted in a long spire. Sometimes\r\nit has been seen divided into two branches, nearly equal to each\r\nother. The spore in germinating empties itself of its plastic\r\ncontents, contracts, and diminishes in size. The pseudospores of\r\n_Æcidium crassum_, P., emit three long filaments, which describe\r\nspirals, imitating the twistings of the stem of a bean or bindweed. In\r\n_Æcidium Violæ_, Schum, one filament is produced, which frequently\r\nrolls up its anterior extremity into a spire, but more often this same\r\nextremity rises in a large ovoid, irregular vesicle, which continues\r\nthe axis of the filament, or makes with it a more or less decided\r\nangle. In whatever manner placed, this vesicle attracts to it all the\r\norange protoplasm, and hardly does this become settled and complete\r\nbefore the vesicle becomes the starting point of a new development,\r\nfor it begins to produce at its apex a filament, more slender than the\r\nprevious one, stiff, and unbranched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Germination of _Æcidium Euphorbia (sylvaticæ)_,\r\nTulasne.]\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Tulasne, the germination of the pseudospores of\r\n_Æcidium Euphorbiæ_ on _Euphorbia sylvatica_ differ in some respects\r\nfrom the preceding. When dropped upon water these spores very soon\r\nemit a short tube, which ordinarily curves in an arch or circle,\r\nalmost from its origin, attaining a length of from three to six times\r\nthe diameter of the spore; then this tube gives rise to four spicules,\r\neach of which produces a small obovate or reniform sporule; the\r\ngeneration of these sporules absorbs all the plastic matter contained\r\nin the germ-tube, which permits of the observation that it was divided\r\ninto four cells corresponding with the number of spicules. These\r\nsporules germinate very rapidly from an indefinite point of their\r\nsurface, emitting a filiform process, which is flexuous and very\r\ndelicate, not extending more in length than three times that of the\r\nlong axis of the sporule, often less, reproducing at its summit a new\r\nsporule, differing in form and size from that which preceded it. This\r\nsporule of the second formation becomes at its apex a vital centre,\r\nand sprouts one or more linear buds, of which the elongation is\r\noccasionally interrupted by the formation of vesicular swellings. As\r\nTulasne observes, the pseudospores of the _Æcidium_ and the greater\r\nnumber of Uredines are easily wetted with water before arriving at\r\nmaturity; but when they are ripe, on the contrary, they appear to be\r\nclothed with a greasy matter which protects them from the liquid,\r\nforcing them almost all to rest on the surface.\r\n\r\nThe pseudospores of _Roestelia_ are produced in strings or chaplets,\r\nas in _Æcidium_, with this difference, that instead of being\r\ncontiguous they are separated by narrow isthmuses. The ripe\r\npseudospores are enveloped in a thick tegument, of a dark brown\r\ncolour. They germinate readily on water, producing a filament fifteen\r\ntimes as long as the diameter of the spore. This filament is sometimes\r\nrolled or curved. Towards its extremity it exhibits protuberances\r\nwhich resemble the rudiments of ramuli, or they terminate in a vesicle\r\nwhich gives rise to a slender filament. The tegument of these\r\npseudospores, above all in those which have germinated, and have\r\nconsequently become more transparent, it is easy to see has many\r\npores, or round ostioles.\r\n\r\nIn _Peridermium_ the pseudospores, when dropped upon water, germinate\r\nat any point of their surface. Sometimes two unequal filaments issue\r\nfrom the same spore. After forty-eight hours of vegetation in the air,\r\nthe greater part had already emitted a multitude of thick little\r\nbranches, themselves either simple or branched, giving to the\r\nfilaments a peculiar aspect. Tulasne did not on any occasion observe\r\nthe formation of secondary spores.\r\n\r\nIn the Uredines proper the germination seems to be somewhat similar,\r\nor at least not offering sufficient differences to warrant special\r\nreference in _Uredo_, _Trichobasis_, _Lecythea_, &c. In _Coleosporium_\r\nthere are two kinds of spores, one kind consisting of pulverulent\r\nsingle cells, and the other of elongated septate cells, which break up\r\ninto obovate joints. Soon after the maturity of the pulverulent\r\nspores, each begins to emit a long tube, which is habitually simple,\r\nand produces at its summit a reproductive cellule, or reniform\r\nsporule. The orange protoplasm passes along the colourless tubes to\r\nthe terminal sporule at the end of its vegetation. The two forms of\r\nspores in this genus are constantly found on the same leaf, and in the\r\nsame pulvinule, but generally the pulverulent spores abound at the\r\ncommencement of the summer. The reniform sporules begin to germinate\r\nin a great number as soon as they are free; some few extend a filament\r\nwhich remains simple and uniform, but more commonly it forms at its\r\nextremity a second sporule. If this does not become isolated, to play\r\nan independent life, the filament is continued, and new vesicles are\r\nrepeated many times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Germinating pseudospores of (_b_) _Coleosporium\r\nSonchi_; (_s s_) secondary spores, or sporules (Tulasne).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Germinating pseudospore (_b_) of _Melampsora\r\nbetulina_ (Tulasne).]\r\n\r\nIn _Melampsora_ the summer spores are of the _Lecythea_ type, and were\r\nincluded in that genus till their relation with _Melampsora_ was\r\nclearly made out. The winter spores are in solid pulvinules, and their\r\nfructification takes place towards the end of winter or in the spring.\r\nThis phenomenon consists in the production of cylindrical tubes,\r\nwhich start from the upper extremity of the wedge-shaped spores, or\r\nmore rarely from the base. These tubes are straight or twisted, simple\r\nor bifurcated, and each of them very soon emits four monosporous\r\nspicules, at the same time that they become septate. The sporules are\r\nin this instance globose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Germinating pseudospore of _Uromyce\r\nappendiculatus_. (Tulasne.)]\r\n\r\nIn _Uromyces_ germination follows precisely the same type as that of\r\nthe upper cell of _Puccinia_; in fact, Tulasne states that it is very\r\ndifficult to say in what they differ from the _Pucciniæ_ which are\r\naccidentally unilocular.\r\n\r\nIn _Cystopus_ a more complex method prevails, which will be examined\r\nmore closely hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn _Puccinia_, as already observed when describing their structure,\r\nthe pseudospores are two-celled. From the pores of each cell, which\r\nare near the central septum, springs a clavate tube, which attains two\r\nor three times the total length of the fruit, and of which the very\r\nobtuse extremity curves more or less in the manner of a crozier.[G]\r\nThis tube, making a perfectly uncoloured transparent membrane, is\r\nfilled with a granular and very pale plastic matter at the expense\r\nof the generative cell, which is soon rendered vacant; then it\r\ngives rise to four spicules, usually on the same side, and at the\r\nsummit of these produces a reniform cellule. The four sporules so\r\nengendered exhaust all the protoplasm at first contained in the\r\ngenerative cell, so that their united capacity proves to be evidently\r\nmuch insufficient to contain it, the more so as it leads to the\r\nbelief that this matter undergoes as it condenses an elaboration\r\nwhich diminishes its size. In all cases the spicule originates\r\nbefore the sporule which it carries, and also attains its full length\r\nwhen the sporule appears. The form of the latter is at first\r\nglobular, then ellipsoid, and more or less curved. All these phases\r\nof vegetation are accomplished in less than twelve hours, and if\r\nthe spore is mature and ready for germination, it is sufficient to\r\nprovoke it by keeping the pseudospores in a humid atmosphere.\r\nDuring this process the two cells do not separate, nor does one\r\ncommence germination before the other, but both simultaneously.\r\nWhen the sporules are produced, the protospore, somewhat analogous\r\nto a prothallus, has performed its functions and decays. Towards\r\nthe time of the falling of the sporules they are nearly all divided\r\ninto four unequal cells by transverse and parallel septa. These\r\nsporules in time produce, from any point on their surface, a\r\nfilament, which reproduces a new sporule, resembling the first, but\r\ngenerally smaller. This sporule of the second generation ordinarily\r\ndetaches itself from its support before germinating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Germinating pseudospore of _Puccinia Moliniæ_.\r\n(Tulasne.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Germinating pseudospore of _Triphragmium\r\nulmariæ_ (Tulasne.)]\r\n\r\nThe pseudospores of _Triphragmium ulmariæ_ have been seen in April\r\ngerminating on old leaves of the meadowsweet which survived the\r\nwinter, whilst at the same time new tufts of the spores were being\r\ndeveloped on the leaves of the year. These fruits of the spring\r\nvegetation would not germinate the same year. Each cell in germination\r\nemits a long cylindrical filament, containing a brownish protoplasm,\r\non which four spicules, bearing as many sporules, are generated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Germinating pseudospore of _Phragmidium\r\nbulbosum_. (Tulasne.)]\r\n\r\nThe germination of the black fruits of _Phragmidium_ only appears to\r\ntake place in the spring. It greatly resembles that in _Puccinia_,\r\nexcept that the filament is shorter, and the sporules are spherical\r\nand orange-coloured, instead of being kidney-shaped and pale. In the\r\nspecies found on the leaves of the common bramble, the filament\r\nemitted by each cell attains three or four times the length of the\r\nfruit. The granular orange protoplasm which fills it passes ere long\r\ninto the sporules, which are engendered at the extremity of pointed\r\nspicules. After the long warty fruits are emptied of their contents\r\nthey still seem as dark as before, but the pores which are pierced in\r\nthe sides, through which the germinating filaments have proceeded, are\r\nmore distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that throughout all these allied genera of\r\n_Uromyces_, _Puccinia_, _Triphragmium_, and _Phragmidium_ the same\r\ntype of germination prevails, which confirms the accuracy of their\r\nclassification together, and renders still less probable the supposed\r\naffinity of _Phragmidium_ with _Sporidesmium_, which was at one time\r\nheld by very astute mycologists, but which is now abandoned. This\r\nstudy of germination leads also to a very definite conclusion with\r\nregard to the genus _Uromyces_--that it is much more closely related\r\nto _Puccinia_ and its immediate allies than to other unicellular\r\nUredines.\r\n\r\nThe germination of the pseudospores of the gelatinous Uredines of the\r\ngenus _Podisoma_ was studied by Tulasne.[H] These pretended spores,\r\nhe writes, are formed of two large conical cells, opposed by their\r\nbase and easily separating. They vary in length. The membrane of which\r\nthey are formed is thin and completely colourless in most of them,\r\nthough much thicker and coloured brown in others. It is principally\r\nthe spores with thin membranes that emit from near the middle very\r\nobtuse tubes, into which by degrees, as they elongate, the contents of\r\nthe parent utricles pass. Each of the two cells of the supposed spore\r\nmay originate near its base four of these tubes, opposed to each other\r\nat their point of origin, and their subsequent direction; but it is\r\nrather rare for eight tubes, two by two, to decussate from the same\r\nspore or basidium. Usually there are only two or three which are\r\ncompletely developed, and these tend together towards the surface of\r\nthe fungus, which they pass, and expand at liberty in the air. The\r\ntubes generally become thicker by degrees as they elongate, some only\r\nslightly exceeding the length of the protospores. Others attain three\r\nor four times that length, according to the greater or less distance\r\nbetween the protospore and the surface of the plant. In the longest\r\ntubes it is easy to observe how the colouring matter passes to their\r\nouter extremity, leaving the portion nearest to the parent cell\r\ncolourless and lifeless. When nearly attaining their ultimate\r\ndimensions, all the tubes are divided towards their outer extremity by\r\ntransverse septa into unequal cells; then simple and solitary\r\nprocesses, of variable length and form, but attenuated upwards,\r\nproceed from each segment of the initial tube, and produce at their\r\nextremity an oval spore (teleutospore, Tul.), which is slightly curved\r\nand unilocular. These spores absorb all the orange endochrome from the\r\noriginal tubes. They appear in immense numbers on the surface of the\r\nfungus, and when detached from their spicules fall upon the ground or\r\non any object which may be beneath them. So freely are they deposited\r\nthat they may be collected on paper, or a slip of glass, like a fine\r\ngold-coloured powder. Again, these secondary spores (teleutospores)\r\nare capable of germination, and many of them will be found to have\r\ngerminated on the surface of the _Podisoma_ whence they originated.\r\nThe germ filament which they produce springs habitually from the side,\r\nat a short distance from the hilum, which indicates the point of\r\nattachment to the original spicule. These filaments will attain to\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty times the diameter of the spore in length\r\nbefore branching, and are in themselves exceedingly delicate. The\r\ntubes which issue from the primary spores (protospores, Tul.) are not\r\nalways simple, but sometimes forked; and the cells which are\r\nultimately formed at their extremities, though producing filiform\r\nprocesses, do not always generate secondary spores (teleutospores) at\r\ntheir apices. This mode of germination, it will be seen, resembles\r\ngreatly that which takes place in _Puccinia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Germinating pseudospores of _Podisoma Juniperi_.\r\n(Tulasne)]\r\n\r\nThe germination of the Ustilagines was in part examined by Tulasne,\r\nbut since has received accessions through the labours of Dr. A.\r\nFischer von Waldheim.[I] Nothing, however, of any importance is added\r\nto our knowledge of the germination of _Tilletia_, which was made\r\nknown as early as 1847.[J] After some days a little obtuse tube is\r\nprotruded through the epispore, bearing at its apex long fusiform\r\nbodies, which are the sporules of the first generation. These\r\nconjugate by means of short transverse tubes, after the manner of the\r\nthreads of _Zygnema_. Afterwards long elliptical sporules of the\r\nsecond generation are produced on short pedicels by the conjugated\r\nfusiform bodies of the first generation. (Fig. 89, _ss._) Ultimately\r\nthese sporules of the second generation germinate, and generate, on\r\nshort spicules, similar sporules of a third generation. (Fig. 89,\r\n_st._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Germinating pseudospore (_g_) of _Tilletia\r\ncaries_ with secondary spores in conjugation. (Tul.)]\r\n\r\nIn _Ustilago (flosculorum)_ germination takes place readily in warm\r\nweather. The germ tube is rather smaller at its base than further on.\r\nIn from fifteen to eighteen hours the contents become coarsely\r\ngranular; at the same time little projections appear on the tube which\r\nare narrowed at the base, into which some of the protoplasm passes.\r\nThese ultimately mature into sporules. At the same time a terminal\r\nsporule generally appears on the threads. Secondary sporules\r\nfrequently grow from the primary, which are rather smaller, and these\r\noccasionally give rise to a third generation.\r\n\r\nIn _Urocystis (pompholygodes)_ the germinating tubes spring\r\nexclusively from the darker central cells of the clusters. From these\r\nare developed at their extremity three or four linear bodies, as in\r\n_Tilletia_, but after this no further development has as yet been\r\ntraced. It may be remarked here that Waldheim observed similar\r\nconjugation of the sporules in some species of _Ustilago_ as have\r\nbeen remarked in the sporules of the first generation in _Tilletia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Pseudospore of _Ustilago receptaculorum_ in\r\ngermination, and secondary spores in conjugation. (Tul.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Conidia and zoospores of _Cystopus candidus_;\r\n_a._ conidium with the plasma divided; _b._ zoospores escaping; _c._\r\nzoospores escaped from the conidium; _d._ active zoospores; _e._\r\nzoospores, having lost their cilia, commencing to germinate.]\r\n\r\nReturning to _Cystopus_, as the last of the Uredines, we must briefly\r\nrecapitulate the observations made by Professor de Bary,[K] who, by\r\nthe bye, claims for them an affinity with _Peronospora_ (Mucedines but\r\ntoo well known in connection with the potato disease), and _not_ with\r\nthe Uredines and their allies. In this genus there are two kinds of\r\nreproductive organs, those produced on the surface of the plant\r\nbursting through the cuticle in white pustules, and which De Bary\r\nterms _conidia_, which are generated in chains, and certain globose\r\nbodies termed _oogonia_, which are developed on the mycelium in the\r\ninternal tissues of the foster plant. When the conidia are sown on\r\nwater they rapidly absorb the moisture, and swell; the centre of one\r\nof the extremities soon becomes a large obtuse papilla resembling the\r\nneck of a bottle. This is filled with a granular protoplasm, in which\r\nvacuoles are formed. Soon, however, these vacuoles disappear, and very\r\nfine lines of demarcation separate the protoplasm into from five to\r\neight polyhedric portions, each presenting a little faintly-coloured\r\nvacuole in the centre (_a_). Soon after this division the papilla at\r\nthe extremity swells, opens itself, and at the same time the five to\r\neight bodies which had formed in the interior are expelled one by one\r\n(_b_). These are zoospores, which at first take a lenticular form,\r\nand group themselves before the mouth of the parent cell in a globose\r\nmass (_c._) Very soon, however, they begin to move, and then vibratile\r\ncilia show themselves (_d_), and by means of these appendages the\r\nentire globule moves in an oscillating manner as one by one the\r\nzoospores disengage themselves, each becoming isolated and swimming\r\nfreely in the surrounding fluid. The movement is precisely that of the\r\nzoospores of Algæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Resting spore of _Cystopus candidus_ with\r\nzoospores escaped.]\r\n\r\nThe generation of the zoospores commences within from an hour and a\r\nhalf to three hours after the sowing of the conidia on water. From the\r\noogonia, or resting spores, similar zoospores, but in greater number,\r\nare generated in the same manner, and their conduct after becoming\r\nfree is identical. Their movements in the water usually last from two\r\nto three hours, then they abate, the cilia disappear, and the spore\r\nbecomes immovable, takes a globose form, and covers itself with a\r\nmembrane of cellulose. Afterwards the spore emits, from any point\r\nwhatever of its surface, a thin, straight or flexuous tube, which\r\nattains a length of from two to ten times the diameter of the spore.\r\nThe extremity becomes clavate or swollen, after the manner of a\r\nvesicle, which receives by degrees the whole of the protoplasm.\r\n\r\nDe Bary then proceeds to describe experiments which he had performed\r\nby watering growing plants with these zoospores, the result being that\r\nthe germinating tubes did not penetrate the epidermis, but entered by\r\nthe stomates, and there put forth an abundant mycelium which traversed\r\nthe intercellular passages. Altogether the germination of these\r\nconidia or zoospores offers so many differences from the ordinary\r\ngermination of the Uredines, and is so like that which prevails in\r\n_Peronospora_, in addition to the fact of both genera producing winter\r\nspores or oogonia, that we cannot feel surprised that the learned\r\nmycologist who made these observations should claim for _Cystopus_ an\r\naffinity with _Peronospora_ rather than with the plants so long\r\nassociated with it amongst the _Coniomycetes_.\r\n\r\nIn passing from these to the _Mucedines_, therefore, we cannot do so\r\nmore naturally than by means of that genus of white moulds to which we\r\nhave just alluded. The erect branched threads bear at the tip of their\r\nbranchlets spores, or conidia, which conduct themselves in a like\r\nmanner to the organs so named in _Cystopus_, and oogonia or resting\r\nspores developed on the mycelium within the tissues of the foster\r\nplant also give origin to similar zoospores.\r\n\r\nThe conidia are borne upon erect, elongated filaments, originating\r\nfrom the creeping mycelium. These threads are hollow, and rarely\r\nseptate; the upper portion divided into numerous branches, and these\r\nagain are subdivided, the ultimate ramuli each terminated by a single\r\nconidium. This body when mature is oval or elliptical, filled with\r\nprotoplasm, but there is a diversity in their mode of germination. In\r\nthe greater part, of which _P. effusa_ may be taken as an example, the\r\nconidia have the function of simple spores. Placed in favourable\r\nconditions, each of them puts forth a germ-tube, the formation of\r\nwhich does not differ in any essential point from what is known of the\r\nspores of the greater part of fungi.\r\n\r\nThe short oval conidia of _P. gangliformis_ have little obtuse papillæ\r\nat their apex, and it is at this point that germination commences.\r\n\r\nThe conidia of _P. densa_ are similar, but the germination is\r\ndifferent. When placed in a drop of water, under favourable\r\ncircumstances, the following changes may be observed in from four to\r\nsix hours. The protoplasm, at first uniformly distributed in all the\r\nconidia, appears strewn with semi-lenticular, and nearly equidistant\r\nvacuoles, of which the plane face is immediately in contact with the\r\nperiphery of the protoplasm. These vacuoles number from sixteen to\r\neighteen in _P. macrocarpa_, but are less numerous in _P. densa_. A\r\nshort time after the appearance of the vacuoles the entire conidium\r\nextends itself so that the papilla disappears. Suddenly it reappears,\r\nelongates itself, its attenuated membrane vanishes, and the protoplasm\r\nis expelled by the narrow opening that remains in place of the\r\npapilla. In normal cases the protoplasm remains united in a single\r\nmass that shows a clear but very delicate outline. When it has reached\r\nthe front of the opening in the conidium, which is thus emptied, the\r\nmass remains immovable. In _P. densa_ it is at first of a very\r\nirregular form, but assumes by degrees a regular globose shape. This\r\nis deprived of a distinct membrane, the vacuoles that disappeared in\r\nthe expulsion again become visible, but soon disappear for a second\r\ntime. The globule becomes surrounded with a membrane of cellulose, and\r\nsoon puts out from the point opposite to the opening of the conidium a\r\nthick tube which grows in the same manner as the germ-tube of the\r\nconidia in other species. Sometimes the expulsion of the protoplasm is\r\nnot completely accomplished; a portion of it remaining in the membrane\r\nof the conidium detaches itself from the expelled portion, and while\r\nthis is undergoing changes takes the form of a vesicle, which is\r\ndestroyed with the membrane. It is very rare that the protoplasm is\r\nnot evacuated, and that the conidia give out terminal or lateral tubes\r\nin the manner that is normal to other species without papillæ. The\r\ngermination just described does not take place unless the conidia are\r\nentirely surrounded by water; it is not sufficient that they repose\r\nupon its surface. Besides, there is another condition which, without\r\nbeing indispensable, has a sensible influence on the germination of\r\n_P. macrocarpa_, and that is the exclusion of light. To ascertain if\r\nthe light or the darkness had any influence, two equal sowings were\r\nplaced side by side, the one under a clear glass bell, the other under\r\na blackened glass bell. Repeated many times, these experiments always\r\ngave the same result--germination in from four to six hours in the\r\nconidia under the blackened glass; no change in those under the clear\r\nglass up to the evening. In the morning germination was completed.\r\n\r\nThe conidia of _P. umbelliferarum_ and _P. infestans_[L] show an\r\nanalogous structure. These bodies, if their development be normal,\r\nbecome zoosporangia. When they are sown upon water, one sees at the\r\nend of some hours the protoplasm divided by very fine lines, and each\r\nof the parts furnished with a small central vacuole. Then the papilla\r\nof the conidium disappears. In its place appears a rounded opening, by\r\nwhich the parts of the protoplasm are expelled rapidly, one after the\r\nother. Each of these, when free, immediately takes the form of a\r\nperfect zoospore, and commences to agitate itself. In a few moments\r\nthe sporangium is empty and the spores disappear from the field of the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nThe zoospores are oval or semi-oval, and in _P. infestans_ the two\r\ncilia spring from the same point on the inferior border of the\r\nvacuole. Their number in a sporangium are from six to sixteen in _P.\r\ninfestans_, and from six to fourteen in _P. umbelliferarum_. The\r\nmovement of the zoospores ceases at the end of from fifteen to thirty\r\nminutes. They become motionless, cover themselves with a membrane of\r\ncellulose, and push out slender bent germ-tubes which are rarely\r\nbranched. It is but seldom that two tubes proceed from the same spore.\r\nThe same development of the zoospores in _P. infestans_ is favoured by\r\nthe exclusion of the light. Placed in a position moderately lighted or\r\nprotected by a blackened bell, the conidia very readily produced\r\nzoospores.\r\n\r\nA second form of germination of the conidia in _P. infestans_, when\r\nsown upon a humid body or on the surface of a drop of water, consists\r\nin the conidium emitting from its summit a simple tube, the extremity\r\nof which swells itself into the form of an oval vesicle, drawing to\r\nitself, little by little, all the protoplasm contained in the\r\nconidium. Then it isolates itself from the germ-tube by a septum, and\r\ntakes all the essential characteristics of the parent conidium. This\r\nsecondary conidium can sometimes engender a third cellule by a similar\r\nprocess. These secondary and tertiary productions have equally the\r\ncharacter of sporangia. When they are plunged into water, the ordinary\r\nproduction of zoospores takes place.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is a third mode of germination which the conidia of _P.\r\ninfestans_ manifest, and which consists in the conidium emitting from\r\nits summit a simple or branched germ-tube. This grows in a similar\r\nmanner to the conidia first named as of such species as _P. effusa_.\r\nThe conditions which control this form of germination cannot be\r\nindicated, since some conidia which germinate after this manner will\r\nsometimes be found mixed with others, the majority of which furnish\r\nzoospores. It may be that the conidia themselves are in some sort of\r\nabnormal condition.\r\n\r\nIn all the species examined the conidia possess the power of\r\ngermination from the moment of their maturity. The younger they are\r\nthe more freely they germinate. They can retain this power for some\r\ndays or weeks, provided they are not entirely dried. Dessication in an\r\nordinary temperature seemed sufficient to destroy the faculty of\r\ngerminating in twenty-four hours, when the conidia had been removed\r\nfrom the leaves on which they were produced. They none of them\r\nretained the faculty during a few months, hence they cannot preserve\r\nit during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe germs of _Peronospora_ enter the foster plant if the spores are\r\nsown upon a part suitable for the development of the parasite. It is\r\neasy to convince one's self that the mycelium, springing from the\r\npenetrating germs, soon takes all the characters that are found in the\r\nadult state. Besides, when cultivated for some time, conidiiphorous\r\nbranches can be seen growing, identical with those to which it owes\r\nits origin. Such cultivation is so readily accomplished that it can be\r\nmade upon cut leaves preserved fresh in a moist atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the species of _Peronospora_ that inhabit perennial plants, or\r\nannual plants that last through the winter, the mycelium hidden in the\r\ntissues of the foster-plant lasts with it. In the spring it\r\nrecommences vegetation, and emits its branches into the newly-formed\r\norgans of its host, there to fructify. The _Peronospora_ of the potato\r\nis thus perennial by means of its mycelium contained in the browned\r\ntissue of the diseased tubers. When in the spring a diseased potato\r\nbegins to grow, the mycelium rises in the stalk, and soon betrays\r\nitself by blackish spots. The parasites can fructify abundantly on\r\nthese little stalks, and in consequence propagate themselves in the\r\nnew season by the conidia coming from the vivacious mycelium.\r\n\r\nThe diseased tubers of the potato always contain the mycelium of _P.\r\ninfestans_, which never fructifies there as long as the skin of the\r\ntuber is intact. But when, in cutting the tuber, the parenchyma\r\noccupied by the mycelium is exposed to the contact of the air, it\r\ncovers itself with conidia-bearing branches at the end of from\r\ntwenty-four to forty-eight hours. Analogous results are obtained with\r\nthe stalks of the potato. It is evident that in these experiments\r\nnothing is changed except the contact of the air; the specific\r\nconditions particularly remain the same. It appears, therefore, that\r\nit is this contact alone which determines generally the production of\r\nthe conidiiferous branches.[M]\r\n\r\nThe mode of germination and development in the Mucors has been studied\r\nby several observers, but most recently by Van Tieghem and Le\r\nMonnier.[N] In one of the common forms, the _Mucor phycomyces_ of some\r\nauthors, and the _Phycomyces nitens_ of others, the process is given\r\nin detail. In this species germination will not take place in ordinary\r\nwater, but it readily takes place in orange juice and other media. The\r\nspore loses colour, swells, and absorbs fluid around it until double\r\nits original size and ovoid. Then a thick thread is emitted from one\r\nor both extremities, which elongates and becomes branched in a pinnate\r\nmanner. Sometimes the exospore is ruptured and detached loosely from\r\nthe germinating spore. After about forty-eight hours from the first\r\nsowing, the mycelium will send branches into the air, which again\r\nbecome abundantly branched; other short submerged branches will also\r\nremain simple, or have tuft-like ramifications, each terminating in a\r\npoint, so as to bristle with spiny hairs. In two or three days\r\nabruptly swollen branches, of a club shape, will make their appearance\r\non the threads both in the air and in the fluid. Sometimes these\r\nbranches are prolonged into an equal number of sporangia-bearing\r\nthreads, but most frequently they divide first at their swollen\r\nsummits into numerous branches, of which usually one, sometimes two\r\nor three, develop into sporangia-bearing threads, while the rest are\r\nshort, pointed, and form a tuft of rootlets. Sometimes these rootlets\r\nreduce themselves to one or more rounded protuberances towards the\r\nbase of the sporangia-bearing threads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Zygospores of _Mucor phycomyces_. (Van Tieghem.)]\r\n\r\nThere are often also a certain number of the branches which had\r\nacquired a clavate shape, and do not erect themselves above the\r\nsurface, instead of producing a fertile thread, which would seem to\r\nhave been their first intention, become abruptly attenuated, and are\r\nmerely prolonged into a mycelial filament. Although in other species\r\nchlamydospores are formed in such places on the mycelium, nothing of\r\nthe kind has been traced in this species, more than here indicated.\r\nOccasionally, when germination is arrested prematurely, certain\r\nportions of the hyphæ, in which the protoplasm maintains its vitality,\r\nbecome partitioned off. This may be interpreted as a tendency towards\r\nthe formation of chlamydospores, but there is no condensation of\r\nprotoplasm, or investiture with a special membrane. Later on this\r\nisolated protoplasm is gradually altered, separating into somewhat\r\nregular ovoid or fusiform granules, which have, to a certain extent,\r\nthe appearance of spores in an ascus, but they seem to be incapable of\r\ngermination.\r\n\r\nAnother method of reproduction, not uncommon in _Mucorini_, is\r\ndescribed by Van Tieghem in this species. Conjugating threads on the\r\nsubstratum by degrees elaborate zygospores, but these, contrary to\r\nthe mode in other species, are surrounded by curious branched\r\nprocesses which emanate from the arcuate cells on either side of the\r\nnewly-developed zygospore. This system of reproduction is again\r\nnoticed more in detail in the chapter on polymorphism.\r\n\r\nM. de Seynes has given the details of his examination of the sporidia\r\nof _Morchella esculenta_ during germination.[O] A number of these\r\nsporidia, placed in water in the morning, presented, at nine o'clock\r\nof the same evening, a sprout from one of the extremities, measuring\r\nhalf the length of the spore. In the morning of the next day this\r\nsprout had augmented, and become a filament three or four times as\r\nlong. The next day these elongated filaments exhibited some transverse\r\ndivisions and some ramifications. On the third day, the germination\r\nbeing more advanced, many more of the sporidia were as completely\r\nchanged, and presented, in consequence of the elongation, the\r\nappearance of a cylindrical ruffle, the cellular prolongations arising\r\nfrom the germination having a tendency towards one of the extremities\r\nof the longer axis of the sporidium, and more often to the two opposed\r\nextremities, either simultaneously or successively. Out of many\r\nhundreds of sporidia examined during germination, he had only seen a\r\nvery few exceptions to this rule, among which he had encountered the\r\ncentrifugal tendency to vegetate by two opposed filaments, proving\r\nthat if it bears a second by the side of the primal filament situated\r\nat one of the poles, a second would also be seen from the side of the\r\nfilament coming from the opposite pole.\r\n\r\nBefore being submitted to the action of water, the contents of the\r\nsporidia seemed formed of two distinct parts, one big drop of yellow\r\noil of the same form as the sporidium, with the space between it and\r\nthe cell wall occupied by a clear liquid, more fluid and less\r\nrefractive, nearly colourless, or at times slightly roseate. As the\r\nmembrane absorbed the water by which it was surrounded, the quantity\r\nof this clear liquid was augmented, and the rosy tint could be more\r\neasily distinguished. All the contents of the spore, which up to this\r\ntime remained divided into two parts, presented altogether one aspect,\r\nonly containing numerous granulations, nearly of equal size,\r\ncompletely filling it, and reaching the inner face of the sporic\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nAfter this time the sporidium augments in size very rapidly, becoming\r\nat times irregular, and sometimes even as much as from two to three\r\ntimes its original dimensions, then there appears at the surface,\r\nusually at one of the poles of the ellipse, a small prominence, with\r\nan extremely fine membrane, which does not appear to separate itself\r\nfrom that which surrounds the sporidium, and it is difficult to say\r\nwhether it is a prolongation of the internal membrane going across the\r\noutside, or simply a prolongation caused by a continuation of tissue\r\nof an unique membrane. Sometimes there may be seen at the point where\r\nthe primal filament issues from the sporidium a circular mark, which\r\nappears to indicate the rupture of the external membrane. From this\r\ntime another change comes over the contents. We again find the yellow\r\noily liquid, now occupying the external position, with some drops of\r\ncolourless or roseate liquid in the centre, so that the oily liquid\r\nand the more limpid fluid interchange the positions which they\r\noccupied previous to the commencement of germination. Whether these\r\ntwo fluids have undergone any change in their constitution is\r\ndifficult to determine, at all events the oily liquid appears to be\r\nless refractive and more granular, and it may be that it is a product\r\nof new formation, containing some of the elements of the primitive\r\noily drop. Having regard to the delicate character of the membrane of\r\nthe germinating filaments, De Seynes supposed that it might offer\r\ngreater facility for the entrance of water by endosmose, and account\r\nfor the rapid enlargement of the sporidia. By a series of experiments\r\nhe became satisfied that this was the case to a considerable extent,\r\nbut he adds:--\"I cannot help supposing that a greater absorption of\r\ngreasy matter in the cell which is the first product of germination\r\nraises an objection to an aqueous endosmose. One can also see in this\r\nexperience a proof of the existence of two special membranes, and so\r\nsuppose that the germinative cell is the continuation of the internal\r\nmembrane, the external membrane alone being susceptible of absorbing\r\nthe liquids, at least with a certain rapidity.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Sporidium of _Ascobolus_ germinating.]\r\n\r\nIn other _Discomycetes_ germination takes place in a similar manner.\r\nBoudier[P] narrates that in _Ascobolus_, when once the spore reaches a\r\nfavourable place, if the circumstances are good, _i.e._, if the\r\ntemperature is sufficiently high and the moisture sufficient, it will\r\ngerminate. The time necessary for this purpose is variable, some hours\r\nsufficing for some species; those of _A. viridis_, for example,\r\ngerminate in eight or ten hours, doubtless because, being terrestrial,\r\nit has in consequence less heat. The spore slightly augments in size,\r\nthen opens, generally at one or other extremity, sometimes at two, or\r\nat any point on its surface, in order to pass the mycelium tubes. At\r\nfirst simple, without septa, and granular in the interior, above all\r\nat the extremity, these tubes, the rudiment of the mycelium, are not\r\nlong in elongating, in branching, and later in having partitions.\r\nThese filaments are always colourless, only the spore may be coloured,\r\nor not. Coemans has described them as giving rise to two kinds of\r\nconidia,[Q] the one having the form of _Torula_, when they give rise\r\nto continuous filaments, the other in the form of _Penicillium_, when\r\nthey give birth to partitioned filaments. De Seynes could never obtain\r\nthis result. Many times he had seen the _Penicillium glaucum_ invade\r\nhis sowings, but he feels confident that it had nothing to do with the\r\n_Ascobolus_. M. Woronin[R] has detailed some observations on the\r\nsexual phenomena which he has observed in _Ascobolus_ and _Peziza_,\r\nand so far as the scolecite is concerned these have been confirmed by\r\nM. Boudier.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for doubt that in other of the _Discomycetes_ the\r\ngermination of the sporidia is very similar to that already seen and\r\ndescribed, whilst in the _Pyrenomycetes_, as far as we are aware,\r\nalthough the production of germinating tubes is by no means difficult,\r\ndevelopment has not been traced beyond this stage.[S]\r\n\r\n   [A] Seynes, J. de, \"Essai d'une Flore Mycologique de la Montpellier,\"\r\n       &c.

The multitude of fungus spores which\r\n       were observed in every case was quite extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nSEXUAL REPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of some sort of sexual reproduction in Fungi has long been\r\nsuspected, although in earlier instances upon insufficient grounds; but\r\nof late years observations have multiplied and facts accumulated which\r\nleave no doubt of its existence. If the _Saprolegniæ_ are left out of the\r\nquestion as disputed Fungi, there still remain a number of well\r\nauthenticated instances of the phenomena of copulation, and many other\r\nfacts which indicate some sort of sexual relationship. The precise\r\nmanner in which those minute bodies, so common amongst the _Sphæronemei_,\r\nwhich we prefer to call stylospores, perform their functions is still to a\r\ngreat extent a mystery; yet it is no longer doubted that certain species\r\nof _Aposphæria_, _Phoma_, _Septoria_, &c., are only conditions of some\r\nspecies of _Sphæria_, often developed and matured in close proximity to\r\nthem on the same host. In _Æcidium_, _Roestelia_, &c., spermogonia are\r\nproduced plentifully on or near the same spots on which the\r\nfructification appears, either simultaneously or at a later period.[A] The\r\nrelation of _Cytispora_ to _Valsa_ was suspected by Fries very many\r\nyears ago, and, as since demonstrated, with very good reason. All\r\nattempts, however, to establish anything like sexual reproduction in\r\nthe higher forms of _Hymenomycetes_ have at present been unsuccessful; and\r\nthe same may be said of the _Gasteromycetes_; but in _Ascomycetes_ and\r\n_Physomycetes_ instances abound.\r\n\r\nWe know not whether any importance is to be attached to the views of\r\nM. A. S. Oersted,[B] which have not since been confirmed, but which\r\nhave been cited with some approval by Professor de Bary, as to a trace\r\nof sexual organs in _Hymenomycetes_. He is supposed to have seen in\r\n_Agaricus variabilis_, P., oocysts or elongated reniform cells, which\r\nspring up like rudimentary branches of the filaments of the mycelium,\r\nand enclose an abundant protoplasm, if not even a nucleus. At the base\r\nof these oocysts appear the presumed antheridia, that is to say, one\r\nor two slender filaments, which generally turn their extremities\r\ntowards the oocysts, and which more rarely are applied to them. Then,\r\nwithout ulteriorily undergoing any appreciable modifications, the\r\nfertile cell or oocyst becomes enveloped in a network of filaments of\r\nmycelium which proceed from the one which bears it, and this tissue\r\nforms the rudiments of the cap. The reality of some kind of\r\nfecundation in this circumstance, and the mode of the phenomena, if\r\nthere is one, are for the present equally uncertain. If M. Oersted's\r\nopinion is confirmed, naturally the whole of the cap will be the\r\nproduct of fecundation. Probably Karsten (Bonplandia, 1862, p. 62) saw\r\nsomething similar in _Agaricus campestris_, but his account is\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Zygospore of _Mucor phycomyces_.]\r\n\r\nIn _Phycomyces_ the organs of reproduction have been subjected to\r\nclose examination by Van Tieghem,[C] and although he failed to\r\ndiscover chlamydospores in this, he describes them in other Mucors. In\r\nthis species, besides the regular sexual development, by means of\r\nsporangia, there is a so-called sexual reproduction by means of\r\nzygospores, which takes place in this wise. The threads which\r\nconjugate to form the zygospores are slender and erect on the surface\r\nof the substratum. Two of these threads come into close contact\r\nthrough a considerable length, and clasp each other by alternate\r\nprotuberances and depressions. Some of the protuberances are prolonged\r\ninto slender tubes. At the same time the free extremities of the\r\nthreads dilate, and arch over one towards the other until their tops\r\ntouch like a vice, each limb of which rapidly increases in size. Each\r\nof these arcuate, clavate cells has now a portion of its extremity\r\nisolated by a partition, by means of which a new hemispherical cell is\r\nformed at the end of each thread at its point of junction with the\r\nopposed thread. These cells become afterwards cylindrical by pressure,\r\nthe protoplasm is aggregated into a mass, the double membrane at the\r\npoint of first contact is absorbed, and the two confluent masses of\r\nprotoplasm form a zygospore invested with a tubercular coat and\r\nenveloped by the primary wall of the two conjugating cells. During\r\nthis formation of the zygospore, the two arched cells whence the\r\nzygospore originated develop a series of dichotomous processes in\r\nclose proximity to the walls which separate them from the zygospore.\r\nThese processes appear at first on one of the arcuate cells in\r\nsuccessive order. The first makes its appearance above upon the convex\r\nside; the succeeding ones to the right and left in descending order;\r\nthe last is in the concavity beneath. It is only after the development\r\nof this that the first process appears on the opposite cell, which is\r\nfollowed by others in the same order. These dichotomous processes are\r\nnothing more than branches developed from the arcuate, or mother\r\ncells. During all these changes, while the zygospore enlarges, the\r\nwall of the arcuate cells becomes coloured brown. This colouring is\r\nmore marked on the convex side, and it shows itself first in the cell\r\non which the dichotomous branches are first produced, and which\r\nretains the darker tint longer than the other. The zone from whence\r\nthe processes issue, and also the processes themselves, have their\r\nwalls blackened deeply, while the walls of the conjugated cells, which\r\ncontinue to clothe the zygospore during the whole of its development,\r\nare bluish-black. By pressure, the thin brittle coat which envelopes\r\nthe zygospore is ruptured, and the coat of the zygospore exposed,\r\nformed of a thick cartilaginous membrane, studded with large irregular\r\nwarts.\r\n\r\nThe germination of the zygospores in this species has not as yet been\r\nobserved, but it is probably the same or very similar to that observed\r\nin other species of _Mucor_. In these the rough tuberculate epispore\r\nsplits on one side, and its internal coat elongates itself and\r\nprotrudes as a tube filled with protoplasm and oil globules,\r\nterminating in an ordinary sporangium. Usually the amount of nutriment\r\ncontained in the zygospore is exhausted by the formation of the\r\nterminal sporangium, according to Brefeld;[D] but Van Tieghem and Le\r\nMonnier remark that in their examinations they have often seen a\r\npartition formed at about a third of the length of the principal\r\nfilament from the base, below which a strong branch is given off, and\r\nthis is also terminated by a large sporangium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Zygospore of _Rhizopus_ in different stages. (De\r\nBary.)]\r\n\r\nDe Bary has given a precise account of the formation of the zygospore\r\nin another of the Mucors, _Rhizopus nigricans_, in which he says that\r\nthe filaments which conjugate are solid rampant tubes, which are\r\nbranched without order and confusedly intermingled. Where two of these\r\nfilaments meet each of them pushes towards the other an appendage\r\nwhich is at first cylindrical and of the same diameter. From the first\r\nthese two processes are applied firmly one to the other by their\r\nextremities; they increase in size, become clavate, and constitute\r\ntogether a fusiform body placed across the two conjugated filaments.\r\nBetween the two halves of this body there exists no constant\r\ndifference of size; often they are both perfectly equal. In each\r\nthere is collected an abundance of protoplasm, and when they have\r\nattained a certain development the largest extremity of each is\r\nisolated by a septum from the clavule, which thus becomes the support\r\nor suspender of the copulative cell. The two conjugated cells of the\r\nfusiform body are generally unequal; the one is a cylinder as long as\r\nit is broad, the other is disciform, and its length is only equal to\r\nhalf its breadth. The primitive membrane of the clavule forms between\r\nthe copulative cells a solid partition of two membranes, but soon\r\nafter the cells have become defined the medial partition becomes\r\npierced in the centre, and then soon entirely disappears, so that the\r\ntwo twin cells are confounded in one single zygospore, which is due to\r\nthe union of two more or less similar utricles. After its formation\r\nthe zygospore still increases considerably in size, and acquires a\r\ndiameter of more than one-fifth of a millimetre. Its form is generally\r\nspherical, and flattened on the faces which are united to the\r\nsuspenders, or it resembles a slightly elongated cask. The membrane\r\nthickens considerably, and consists at the time of maturity of two\r\nsuperposed integuments; the exterior or epispore is solid, of a dark\r\nblackish-blue colour, smooth on the plane faces in contact with the\r\nsuspenders, but covered everywhere else with thick warts, which are\r\nhollow beneath. The endospore is thick and composed of several layers,\r\ncolourless, and covered with warts, which correspond and fit into\r\nthose of the epispore. The contents of the zygospore are a coarsely\r\ngranular protoplasm, in which float large oleaginous drops. While the\r\nzygospore is increasing in size, the suspender of the smaller\r\ncopulative cell becomes a rounded and stipitate utricle, often divided\r\nat the base by a septum, and which attains almost to the size of the\r\nzygospore. The suspender of the larger copulative cell preserves its\r\nprimitive form and becomes scarcely any larger. It is rare that there\r\nis not a considerable difference of size between the two conjugated\r\ncells and the suspenders.[E]\r\n\r\nSimilar conjugation with like results also takes place in _Syzygites\r\nmegalocarpus_. In this species the germination of the zygospores has\r\nbeen observed. If, after a certain time of repose, these bodies are\r\nplaced on a moist substratum, they emit a germ-like tube, which,\r\nwithout originating a proper mycelium, develops at the expense of the\r\nnutritive material stored in the zygospore into a carpophore or fruit\r\nbearer, which is many times dichotomously branched, bearing terminal\r\nsporangia characteristic of the species.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked by us that the _Saprolegnei_ are claimed\r\nby some authors as Algæ, whilst we are more disposed to regard them as\r\nclosely allied to the Mucors, and as they exhibit in themselves strong\r\nevidence in support of the existence of sexual reproduction, we cannot\r\nforbear giving a summary of what has been observed by De Bary and\r\nothers in this very interesting and singular group of plants, to which\r\nM. Cornu has recently dedicated an exhaustive monograph.[F]\r\n\r\nIn _Saprolegnia monoica_, and others, the female organs consist of\r\noogonia--that is to say, of cells which are at first globose and rich\r\nin plastic matter, which most generally terminate short branches of\r\nthe mycelium, and which are rarely seen in an interstitial position.\r\nThe constitutive membrane of the adult oogonia is reabsorbed in a\r\ngreat many points, and is there pierced with rounded holes. At the\r\nsame time the plasma is divided into a larger or smaller number of\r\ndistinct portions, which are rounded into little spheres, and separate\r\nfrom the walls of the conceptacle in order to group themselves at the\r\ncentre, where they float in a watery fluid. These gonospheres are then\r\nsmooth and bare, with no membrane on their surface of the nature of\r\ncellulose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Conjugation in _Achlya racemosa_. (Cornu.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the formation of the oogonia there arise from its pedicel\r\nor from neighbouring filaments slight cylindrical curved branches,\r\nsometimes turned round the support of the oogonia, and which all tend\r\ntowards this organ. Their superior extremity is intimately applied\r\nto its wall, then ceases to be elongated, becomes slightly inflated,\r\nand is limited below by a partition; it is then an oblong cell,\r\nslightly curved, filled with protoplasm, and intimately applied to\r\nthe oogonia--in fact, an antheridium or organ of the male sex.\r\nEach oogonium possesses one or several antheridia. Towards the time\r\nwhen the gonospheres are formed it may be observed that each\r\nantheridium sends to the interior of the oogonia one or several\r\ntubular processes, which have crossed its side wall, and which open\r\nat their extremity in order to discharge their contents. These,\r\nwhile they are flowing out, present some very agile corpuscles, and\r\nwhich, considering their resemblance to those in _Vaucheria_, to\r\nwhich the name of spermatozoids are applied, ought to be considered\r\nas the fecundating corpuscles. After the evacuation of the antheridia\r\nthe gonospheres are found to be covered with cellulose; they then\r\nconstitute so many oospores, with solid walls. De Bary considers\r\nthat, bearing in mind analogous phenomena observed in _Vaucheria_, and\r\nthe direct observations of Pringsheim,[G] the cellulose membrane on\r\nthe surface of the gonospheres is only the consequence of a sexual\r\nfecundation.\r\n\r\nIn _Achlya dioica_ the antheridium is cylindrical, the plasma which it\r\nencloses is divided into particles, which attain nearly the size of\r\nthe zoospores of the same plant. These particles become globose\r\ncells, grouped in the centre of the antheridium. Afterwards the\r\ncontents of these latter cells become divided into numerous bacillary\r\nspermatozoids, which first break the wall of their mother cell, and\r\nthen issue from the antheridium. These rod-like corpuscles, which\r\nresemble the spermatozoids in _Vaucheria_, have their movements\r\nassisted by a long cilium. It is presumable that here, as in the\r\nAlgæ, the spermatozoids introduce themselves into the cavity of\r\nthe oogonium, and unite with the gonospheres.\r\n\r\nAmongst obscure and doubtful bodies are those described by Pringsheim,\r\nwhich have their origin in thick filaments or tubes, similar to those\r\nwhich form the zoosporangia, and represent so many distinct little\r\nmasses of plasma within an homogeneous parietal ganglion. The contour\r\nof these plastic masses is soon delineated in a more precise manner.\r\nWe see in their interior some homogeneous granules, which are at first\r\nglobose, then oval, and finally travel to the enlarged and ampullæform\r\nextremity of the generating tube. There they become rounded or oval\r\ncells covered with cellulose, and emit from their surface one or\r\nseveral cylindrical processes, which elongate towards the wall of the\r\nconceptacle, and pierce it, without, however, ever projecting very far\r\nbeyond it. At the same time the lacunose protoplasm of each cell\r\nbecomes divided into a number of corpuscles, which escape by the open\r\nextremity of the cylindrical neck. They resemble in their organization\r\nand agility the spermatozoids of _Achlya dioica_. They soon become\r\nmotionless in water, and do not germinate. During the development of\r\nthese organs, the protoplasm of the utricle which contains them offers\r\nat first completely normal characteristics, and disappears entirely by\r\ndegrees as they increase. De Bary and Pringsheim believe that these\r\norgans constitute the antheridia of the species of _Saprolegnia_ to\r\nwhich they belong.\r\n\r\nThe oospores of the _Saprolegniæ_, when arrived at maturity, possess a\r\ntolerably thick double integument, consisting of an epispore and an\r\nendospore. After a considerable time of repose they give rise to\r\ntubular or vesicular germs, which, without being much elongated,\r\nproduce zoospores.[H]\r\n\r\nDe Bary has claimed for the oogonia in _Cystopus_ and _Peronospora_ a\r\nkind of fecundation which deserves mention here.[I] These same fruits,\r\nhe says, which owe their origin to sexual organs, should bear the\r\nnames of _oogonia_ and _antheridia_, according to the terminology\r\nproposed by Pringsheim for analogous organs in the Algæ. The formation\r\nof the oogonia, or female organs, commences by the terminal or\r\ninterstitial swelling of the tubes of the mycelium, which increase and\r\ntake the form of large spherical or oboval cells, and which separate\r\nthemselves by septa from the tube which carries them. Their membrane\r\nencloses granules of opaque protoplasm, mingled with numerous bulky\r\ngranules of colourless fatty matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--Conjugation in _Peronospora; a. antheridium_.\r\n(De Bary.)]\r\n\r\nThe branches of the mycelium which do not bear oogonia apply their\r\nobtuse extremities against the growing oogonia; this extremity swells,\r\nand, by a transverse partition, separates itself from the supporting\r\ntube. It is the antheridium, or male organ, which is formed by this\r\nprocess; it takes the form of an obliquely clavate or obovate cellule,\r\nwhich is always considerably smaller than the oogonium, and adheres to\r\nits walls by a plane or convex area. The slightly thickened membrane\r\nof the antheridia encloses protoplasm which is finely granular. It is\r\nseldom that more than one antheridium applies itself to an oogonium.\r\n\r\nThe two organs having together achieved their development, the large\r\ngranules contained in the oogonium accumulate at its centre to group\r\nthemselves under the form of an irregular globule deprived of a proper\r\nmembrane, and surrounded by a bed of almost homogeneous protoplasm.\r\nThis globule is the _gonosphere_, or reproductive sphere, which,\r\nthrough the means of fecundation, should become the reproductive\r\nbody, vegetable egg, or oospore. The gonosphere having been formed,\r\nthe antheridium shoots out from the centre of its face, close against\r\nthe oogonium, a straight tube, which perforates the walls of the\r\nfemale cell, and traversing the protoplasm of its periphery, directs\r\nitself to the gonosphere. It ceases to elongate itself as soon as it\r\ntouches it, and the gonosphere becomes clothed with a membrane of\r\ncellulose, and takes a regular spheroidal form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Antheridia and oogonium of _Peronospora_. (De\r\nBary.)]\r\n\r\nConsidering the great resemblance of these organs with the sexual\r\norgans of the Saprolegniæ, which are closely allied to the Algæ, and\r\nof which the sexuality has been proved, De Bary adds, we have no doubt\r\nwhatever that the phenomena just described represent an act of\r\nfecundation, and that the tube pushed out by the antheridium should be\r\nregarded as a fecundating tube. It is remarkable that amongst these\r\nfungi the tube projected by the antheridium effects fecundation only\r\nby contact. Its extremity never opens, and we never find antherozoids;\r\non the contrary, the antheridium presents, up to the maturity of the\r\noospore, the appearance which it presented at the moment of\r\nfecundation.\r\n\r\nThe primitive membrane of the oospore, at first very thin, soon\r\nacquires a more sensible thickness, and becomes surrounded by an\r\nexternal layer (epospore), which is formed at the expense of the\r\nprotoplasm of the periphery. This disappears in proportion as the\r\nepispore attains maturity, and finally there only remains a quantity\r\nof granules, suspended in a transparent watery fluid. At the period of\r\nmaturity, the epispore is a slightly thickened, resistant membrane, of\r\na yellowish-brown colour, and finely punctate. The surface is almost\r\nalways provided with brownish warts, which are large and obtuse,\r\nsometimes isolated, and sometimes confluent, forming irregular crests.\r\nThese warts are composed of cellulose, which reagents colour of a deep\r\nblue, whilst the membrane which bears them preserves its primitive\r\ncolour. One of the warts, larger than the rest, and recognizable by\r\nits cylindrical form, always forms a kind of thick sheath around the\r\nfecundating tube. The ripe endospore is a thick, smooth, colourless\r\nmembrane, composed of cellulose containing a bed of finely granulated\r\nprotoplasm, which surrounds a great central vacuole. This oospore, or\r\nresting spore, may remain dormant in this state within the tissues of\r\nthe foster plant for some months. Its ultimate development by\r\nproduction of zoospores is similar to the production of zoospores from\r\nconidia, which it is unnecessary to repeat here. The oospore becomes\r\nan oosporangium, and from it at least a hundred germinating bodies are\r\nat length expelled.\r\n\r\nAmongst the principal observers of certain phenomena of copulation in\r\ncells formed in the earliest stages of the _Discomycetes_ are\r\nProfessor de Bary,[J] Dr. Woronin,[K] and Messrs. Tulasne.[L] In the\r\n_Ascobolus pulcherrimus_ of Crouan, Woronin ascertained that the cup\r\nderives its origin from a short and flexible tube, thicker than the\r\nother branches of the mycelium, and which is soon divided by\r\ntransverse septa into a series of cells, the successive increase of\r\nwhich finally gives to the whole a torulose and unequal appearance.\r\nThe body thus formed he calls a \"vermiform body.\" The same observer\r\nalso seems to have convinced himself that there exists always in\r\nproximity to this body certain filaments, the short arched or\r\ninflected branches of which, like so many antheridia, rest their\r\nanterior extremities on the utriform cells. This contact seems to\r\ncommunicate to the vermiform body a special vital energy, which is\r\nimmediately directed towards the production of a somewhat filamentous\r\ntissue, on which the hymenium is at a later period developed. This\r\n\"vermiform body\" of M. Woronin has since come to be recognized under\r\nthe name of \"scolecite.\"\r\n\r\nTulasne observes that this \"scolecite\" or ringed body can be readily\r\nisolated in _Ascobolus furfuraceus_. When the young receptacles are\r\nstill spherical and white, and have not attained a diameter exceeding\r\nthe one-twentieth of a millimetre, it is sufficient to compress them\r\nslightly in order to rupture them at the summit and expel the\r\n\"scolecite.\" This occupies the centre of the little sphere, and is\r\nformed of from six to eight cells, curved in the shape of a comma.\r\n\r\nIn _Peziza melanoloma_, A. and S., the same observer succeeded still\r\nbetter in his searches after the scolecite, which he remarks is in\r\nthis species most certainly a lateral branch of the filaments of the\r\nmycelium. This branch is isolated, simple, or forked at a short\r\ndistance from its base, and in diameter generally exceeding that of\r\nthe filament which bears it. This branch is soon arcuate or bent, and\r\noften elongated in describing a spiral, the irregular turns of which\r\nare lax or compressed. At the same time its interior, at first\r\ncontinuous, becomes divided by transverse septa into eight or ten or\r\nmore cells. Sometimes this special branch terminates in a crozier\r\nshape, which is involved in the bent part of another crozier which\r\nterminates a neighbouring filament. In other cases the growing branch\r\nis connected, by its extremity, with that of a hooked branch. These\r\ncontacts, however, did not appear to Tulasne to be so much normal as\r\naccidental. But of the importance of the ringed body, or \"scolecite,\"\r\nthere was no room for doubt, as being the certain and habitual\r\nrudiment of the fertile cup. In fact, inferior cells are produced from\r\nthe flexuous filaments which creep about its surface, cover and\r\nsurround it on all sides, while joining themselves to each other. At\r\nfirst continuous, then septate, these cells by their union constitute\r\na cellular tissue, which increases little by little until the\r\nscolecite is so closely enveloped that only its superior extremity can\r\nbe seen. These cellular masses attain a considerable volume before the\r\nhymenium begins to show itself in a depression of their summit. So\r\nlong as their smallness permits of their being seen in the field of\r\nthe microscope, it can be determined that they adhere to a single\r\nfilament of the mycelium by the base of the scolecite which remains\r\nnaked.\r\n\r\nAlthough Tulasne could not satisfy himself of the presence of any act\r\nof copulation in _Ascobolus furfuraceus_, or _Peziza melanoloma_, he\r\nwas more successful with _Peziza omphalodes_. As early as 1860 he\r\nrecognized the large globose, sessile, and grouped vesicles which\r\noriginate the fertile tissue, but did not comprehend the part which\r\nthese macrocysts were to perform. Each of these emits from its summit\r\na cylindrical tube, generally flexuous, but always more or less bent\r\nin a crozier shape, sometimes attenuated at the extremity. Thus\r\nprovided, these utricles resemble so many tun-shaped, narrow-necked\r\nretorts, filled with a granular thick roseate protoplasm. In the\r\nmiddle of these, and from the same filaments, are generated elongated\r\nclavate cells, with paler contents, more vacuoles, which Tulasne names\r\n_paracysts_. These, though produced after the _macrocysts_, finally\r\nexceed them in height, and seem to carry their summit so as to meet\r\nthe crozier-like prolongations. It would be difficult to determine to\r\nwhich of these two orders of cells belongs the initiative of\r\nconjugation. Sometimes the advance seems to be on one side, and\r\nsometimes on the other. However this may be, the meeting of the\r\nextremity of the connecting tube with the summit of the neighbouring\r\nparacyst is a constant fact, observed over and over again a hundred\r\ntimes. There is no real junction between the dissimilar cells above\r\ndescribed, except at the very limited point where they meet, and there\r\na circular perforation may be discerned at the end, defined by a round\r\nswelling, which is either barely visible or sometimes very decided.\r\nEverywhere else the two organs may be contiguous, or more or less near\r\ntogether, but they are free from any adherence whatever. If the\r\nplastic matters contained in the conjugated cells influence one\r\nanother reciprocally, no notable modification in their appearance\r\nresults at first. The large appendiculate cell seems, however, to\r\nyield to its consort a portion of the plasma it contains. One thing\r\nonly can be affirmed from these phenomena, that the conjugated cells,\r\nespecially the larger, wither and empty themselves, while the upright\r\ncompressed filaments, which will ultimately constitute the asci,\r\nincrease and multiply.[M]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Conjugation in _Peziza omphalodes_. (Tulasne.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100a.--Formation of conceptacle in _Erysiphe_.]\r\n\r\nCertain phenomena concerned in the development of the _Erysiphei_ belong\r\nalso to this connection. The mycelium of _Erysiphe cichoracearum_, like\r\nthat of other species, consists of branched filaments, crossed in all\r\ndirections, which adhere as they climb to the epidermis of the plant on\r\nwhich the fungus lives as a parasite. The perithecia are engendered\r\nwhere two filaments cross each other. These swell slightly at this\r\npoint, and each emits a process which imitates a nascent branch, and\r\nremains upright on the surface of the epidermis. The process\r\noriginating from the inferior filament soon acquires an oval form and\r\na diameter double that of the filament; then it becomes isolated from\r\nit by a septum, and constitutes a distinct cell, which De Bary[N]\r\nterms an oocyst. The appendage which proceeds from the inferior filament\r\nalways adheres intimately to this cell, and elongates into a slender\r\ncylindrical tube, which terminates in an obtuse manner at the summit\r\nof the same cell. At its base it is also limited by a septum, and soon\r\nafter another appears a little below its extremity at a point\r\nindicated beforehand by a constriction. This new septum defines a\r\nterminal short obtuse cell, the antheridium, which is thus borne on a\r\nnarrow tube like a sort of pedicel. Immediately after the formation of\r\nthe antheridia new productions show themselves, both around the oocyst\r\nand within it. Underneath this cell eight or ten tubes are seen to\r\nspring from the filament which bears it; these join themselves by the\r\nsides to each other and to the pedicel of the antheridium, while they\r\napply their inner face to the oocyst, above which their extremities soon\r\nmeet. Each of the tubes is then divided by transverse septa into two\r\nor three distinct cells, and in this manner the cellular walls of the\r\nperithecia come into existence.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the oocyst enlarges and divides, without its being\r\npossible precisely to determine the way in which it happens, into a\r\ncentral cell and an outer layer, ordinarily simple, of smaller\r\ncells, contiguous to the general enveloping wall. The central cell\r\nbecomes the single ascus, which is characteristic of the species,\r\nand the layer which surrounds it constitutes the inner wall of its\r\nperithecium. The only changes afterwards observed are the increase\r\nin size of the perithecium, the production of the root-like filaments\r\nwhich proceed from its outer wall, the brown tint which it assumes,\r\nand finally the formation of the sporidia in the ascus. The\r\nantheridium remains for a long time recognizable without undergoing\r\nany essential modification, but the dark colour of the perithecium\r\nsoon hides it from the observer's eye. De Bary thinks that he is\r\nauthorized in assuming the probability that the conceptacles and\r\norgans of fructification of others of the _Ascomycetes_, including\r\nthe _Discomycetes_ and the _Tuberacei_, are the results of sexual\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nCertain phenomena which have been observed amongst the _Coniomycetes_\r\nare cited as examples of sexual association. Amongst these may be\r\nnamed the conjugation of the slender spores of the first generation,\r\nproduced on the germinating threads of _Tilletia_,[O] and similar\r\nacts of conjugation, as observed in some species of _Ustilago_.\r\nWhether this interpretation should be placed on those phenomena in the\r\npresent condition of our knowledge is perhaps an open question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--_Tilletia caries_ with conjugating cells.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the spermogonia must be regarded as in some occult manner,\r\nwhich as yet has baffled detection, influencing the perfection of\r\nsporidia[P] In _Rhytisma_, found on the leaves of maple and willow,\r\nblack pitchy spots at first appear, which contain within them a golden\r\npulp, in which very slender corpuscles are mixed with an abundant\r\nmucilage. These corpuscles are the spermatia, which in _Rhytisma\r\nacerinum_ are linear and short, in _Rhytisma salicinum_ globose. When\r\nthe spermatia are expelled, the stroma thickens for the production of\r\nasci and sporidia, which are afterwards developed during the autumn\r\nand winter.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the species of _Hysterium_ also possess spermogonia,\r\nnotably _H. Fraxini_, which may be distinguished from the ascigerous\r\nperithecia with which they are associated by their smaller size and\r\nflask-like shape. From these the spermatia are expelled long before\r\nthe maturity of the spores. In _Hypoderma virgultorum_, _H.\r\ncommune_, and _H. scirpinum_, the spermogonia are small depressed\r\nblack capsules, which contain an abundance of minute spermatia.\r\nThese were formerly regarded as distinct species, under the name of\r\n_Leptostroma_. In _Stictis ocellata_ a great number of the tubercles\r\ndo not pass into the perfect state until after they have produced\r\neither linear, very short spermatia, or stylospores, the latter\r\nbeing reproductive bodies of an oblong shape, equal in size to the\r\nperfect sporidia. Some of the tubercles never pass beyond this stage.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a very common fungus which forms black discoid spots\r\non dead holly leaves, called _Ceuthospora phacidioides_, figured by\r\nGreville in his \"Scottish Cryptogamic Flora,\" which expels a profusion\r\nof minute stylospores; but later in the season, instead of these, we\r\nfind the asci and sporidia of _Phacidium ilicis_, so that the two are\r\nforms and conditions the one of the other.\r\n\r\nIn _Tympanis conspersa_ the spermogonia are much more commonly met\r\nwith than the complete fruit. There is a great external resemblance in\r\nthem to the ascigerous cups, but there is no evidence that they are\r\never transformed into such. The perfect sporidia are also very minute\r\nand numerous, being contained in asci borne in cups, which usually\r\nsurround the spermogonia.\r\n\r\nIn several species of _Dermatea_ the stylospores and spermatia\r\nco-exist, but they are disseminated before the appearance of the\r\nascigerous receptacles, yet they are produced upon a common stroma not\r\nunlike that of _Tubercularia_.\r\n\r\nIn its early stage the common and well-known _Bulgaria inquinans_,\r\nwhich when mature looks like a black _Peziza_, is a little tubercle,\r\nthe whole mass of which is divided into ramified lobes, the\r\nextremities of which become, towards the surface of the tubercle,\r\nreceptacles from whence escape waves of spermatia which are\r\ncolourless, or stylospores mixed with them which are larger and nearly\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Sphæriacei_ numerous instances might be cited of minute\r\nstylosporous bodies in consort with, or preceding, the ascigerous\r\nreceptacles. A very familiar example may be found at the base of old\r\nnettle stems in what has been named _Aposphæria acuta_, but which\r\ntruly are only the stylospores of the _Sphæria coniformis_, the\r\nperithecia of which flourish in company or in close proximity to them.\r\nMost of these bodies are so minute, delicate, and hyaline that the\r\ndifficulties in the way of tracing them in their relations to the\r\nbodies with which they are associated are very great. Nevertheless\r\nthere is strong presumption in favour of regarding some of them as\r\nperforming the functions which the name applied to them indicates.\r\n\r\nProfessor de Bary cautiously refrains from accepting spermatia other\r\nthan as doubtful or at least uncertain sexual bodies.[Q] He says that\r\nthe Messrs. Tulasne have supposed that the spermogonia represented the\r\nmale sex, and that the spermatia were analogous to spermatozoids.\r\nTheir opinion depends on two plausible reasons,--the spermatia, in\r\nfact, do not germinate, and the development of the spermogonia\r\ngenerally precedes the appearance of the sporophorous organs, a double\r\ncircumstance which reminds us of what is known of the spermatozoids\r\nand antheridia of other vegetables. It remained to discover which were\r\nthe female organs which underwent fecundation from the spermatia.\r\n\r\nMany organs placed at first amongst spermatia have been recognized by\r\nM. Tulasne as being themselves susceptible of germination, and\r\nconsequently ought to take their place among legitimate spores. Then\r\nit must be considered that very many spores can only germinate under\r\ncertain conditions. It is, therefore, for the present a doubtful\r\nquestion whether there exist really any spermatia incapable of\r\ngermination, or if the default of germination of these corpuscles does\r\nnot rather depend on the experiments hitherto attempted not having\r\nincluded the conditions required by the phenomena. Moreover, as yet no\r\ntrace has been discovered of the female organs which are specially\r\nfecundated by the spermatia.\r\n\r\nFinally, there exist in the _Ascomycetes_ certain organs of\r\nreproduction, diverse spore-bearing apparatus, pycnidia, and others,\r\nwhich, like the spermogonia, usually precede ascophorous fruits. The\r\nreal nature of the spermogonia and spermatia should therefore be\r\nregarded as, at present, very uncertain; as regards, however, the\r\nspermatia which have never been seen to germinate, perhaps it is as\r\nwell not to absolutely reject the first opinion formed concerning\r\nthem, or perhaps they might be thought to perform the part of\r\nandrospores, attributing to that expression the meaning which\r\nPringsheim gives it in the _Conferoæ_. The experiments performed with\r\nthe spermatia which do not germinate, and with the spermogonia of the\r\nUredines, do not, at any rate, appear to justify the reputed masculine\r\nor fecundative nature of these organs. The spermogonia constantly\r\naccompany or precede fruits of _Æcidium_, whence naturally follows the\r\npresumption that the first are in a sexual relation to the second.\r\nStill, when Tulasne cultivated _Endophyllum sempervivum_, he obtained\r\non some perfectly isolated rosettes of _Sempervivum_ some _Æcidium_\r\nrichly provided with normal and fertile spores, without any trace of\r\nspermogonia or of spermatia.\r\n\r\n   [A] M. Tulasne has devoted a chapter to the spermogonia of the\r\n       Uredines in his memoir, to which we have already alluded.\r\n\r\n   [B] Oeersted, in \"Verhandl der König. Dän. Gesell.

At the same time, we fear that a great\r\nmany assumptions have been accepted for fact, and supposed connections\r\nand relations between two or three or more so-called species,\r\nbelonging to different genera, have upon insufficient data been\r\nregarded as so many states or conditions of one and the same plant.\r\nHad the very pertinent suggestions of Professor de Bary been more\r\ngenerally acted upon, these suspicions would have been baseless. His\r\nobservations are so valuable as a caution, that we cannot forbear\r\nprefacing our own remarks on this subject by quoting them.[A] In order\r\nto determine, he says, whether an organic form, an organ, or an\r\norganism, belongs to the same series of development as another, or\r\nthat which is the same is developed from it, or _vice versâ_, there is\r\nonly one way, viz., to observe how the second grows out of the first.\r\nWe see the commencement of the second begin as a part of the first,\r\nperfect itself in connection with it, and at last it often becomes\r\nindependent; but be it through spontaneous dismembering from the\r\nfirst, or that the latter be destroyed and the second remains, both\r\ntheir disunited bodies are always connected together in organic\r\ncontinuity, as parts of a whole (single one) that can cease earlier or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nBy observing the organic continuity, we know that the apple is the\r\nproduct of development of an apple-tree, and not hung on it by\r\nchance, that the pip of an apple is a product of the development of\r\nthe apple, and that from the pip an apple-tree can at last be\r\ndeveloped, that therewith all these bodies are members of a sphere of\r\ndevelopment or form. It is the same with every similar experience of\r\nour daily life, that where an apple-tree stands, many apples lie on\r\nthe ground, or that in the place where apple-pips are sown seedlings,\r\nlittle apple-trees, grow out of the ground, is not important to our\r\nview of the course of development. Every one recognizes that in his\r\ndaily life, because he laughs at a person who thinks a plum which\r\nlies under an apple-tree has grown on it, or that the weeds which\r\nappear among the apple seedlings come from apple-pips. If the\r\napple-tree with its fruit and seed were microscopically small, it\r\nwould not make the difference of a hair's breadth in the form of the\r\nquestion or the method of answering it, as the size of the object\r\ncan be of no importance to the latter, and the questions which\r\napply to microscopical fungi are to be treated in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIf it then be asserted that two or several forms belong to a series of\r\ndevelopment of one kind, it can only be based on the fact of their\r\norganic continuity. The proof is more difficult than in large plants,\r\npartly because of the delicacy, minuteness, and fragility of the\r\nsingle parts, particularly the greater part of the mycelia, partly\r\nbecause of the resemblance of the latter in different species, and\r\ntherefore follows the danger of confusing them with different kinds,\r\nand finally, partly in consequence of the presence of different kinds\r\nin the same substratum, and therefore the mixture not only of\r\ndifferent sorts of mycelia, but also that different kinds of spores\r\nare sown. With some care and patience, these difficulties are in no\r\nway insurmountable, and they must at any rate be overcome; the organic\r\ncontinuity or non-continuity must be cleared up, unless the question\r\nrespecting the course of development, and the series of forms of\r\nspecial kinds, be laid on one side as insolvable.\r\n\r\nSimple and intelligible as these principles are, they have not always\r\nbeen acted upon, but partly neglected, partly expressly rejected, not\r\nbecause they were considered false, but because the difficulties of\r\ntheir application were looked upon as insurmountable. Therefore\r\nanother method of examination was adopted; the spores of a certain\r\nform were sown, and sooner or later they were looked after to see what\r\nthe seed had produced--not every single spore--but the seed _en\r\nmasse_, that is, in other words, what had grown on that place where\r\nthe seed had been sown. As far as it relates to those forms which are\r\nso widely spread, and above all grow in conjunction with one\r\nanother--and that is always the case in the specimens of which we\r\nspeak--we can never be sure that the spores of the form which we mean\r\nto test are not mingled with those of another species. He who has made\r\nan attentive and minute examination of this kind knows that we may be\r\nsure to find such a mixture, and that such an one was there can be\r\nafterwards decidedly proved. From the seed which is sown, these\r\nspores, for which the substratum was most suitable, will more easily\r\ngerminate, and their development will follow the more quickly. The\r\nfavoured germs will suppress the less favoured, and grow up at their\r\nexpense. The same relation exists between them as between the seeds,\r\ngerms, and seedlings of a sown summer plant, and the seeds which have\r\nbeen undesignedly sown with it, only in a still more striking manner,\r\nin consequence of the relatively quick development of the mildew\r\nfungus.\r\n\r\nTherefore, that from the latter a decided form, or a mixture of\r\nseveral forms, is to be found sown on one spot, is no proof of\r\ntheir generic connection with one which has been sown for the\r\npurpose of experiments; and the matter will only be more confused\r\nif we call imagination to our aid, and place the forms which are\r\nfound near one another, according to a real or fancied resemblance,\r\nin a certain series of development. All those statements on the\r\nsphere of form and connection, which have for their basis such a\r\nsuperficial work, and are not based on the clear exposition of the\r\ncontinuity of development, as by the origin of the connection of\r\nthe _Mucor_ with _Penicillium_, _Oidium lactis_ and _Mucor_, _Oidium_\r\nand _Penicillium_, are rejected as unfounded.\r\n\r\nA source of error, which can also interfere in the last-named\r\nsuperficial method of cultivation for experiments, is, viz., that\r\nheterogeneous unwished-for spores intrude themselves from without,\r\namong the seed which is sown, but that has been until now quite\r\ndisregarded. It is of great importance in practice, but in truth, for\r\nour present purpose, synonymous with what we have already written.\r\nThose learned in the science of this kind of culture lay great stress\r\non its importance, and many apparatuses have been constructed, called\r\n\"purely cultivating machines,\" for the purpose of destroying the\r\nspores which are contained in the substratum, and preventing the\r\nintrusion of those from without. The mixture in the seed which is sown\r\nhas of course not been obviated. These machines may, perhaps, in every\r\nother respect, fulfil their purpose, but they cannot change the form\r\nof the question, and the most ingeniously constructed apparatus cannot\r\nreplace the attention and intellect of the observer.[B]\r\n\r\nTwo distinct kinds of phenomena have been grouped under the term\r\n\"polymorphy.\" In one series two or more forms of fruit occur\r\nconsecutively or simultaneously on the same individual, and in the\r\nother two or more forms appear on a different mycelium, on a different\r\npart of the same plant, or on a matrix wholly distinct and different;\r\nin the latter case the connection being attested or suspected\r\ncircumstantially, in the former proved by the method suggested by De\r\nBary. It will at once be conceded that in cases where actual growth\r\nand development substantiate the facts the polymorphy is undoubted,\r\nwhilst in the other series it can at best be little more than\r\nsuspected. We will endeavour to illustrate both these series by\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and earliest suspected cases of dualism, which long\r\npuzzled the older mycologists, was observed amongst the Uredines, and\r\nmany years ago it was held that there must be some mysterious\r\nassociation between the \"red rust\" (_Trichobasis ruligo vera_) of\r\nwheat and grasses and the \"corn mildew\" (_Puccinia graminis_) which\r\nsucceeded it. The simple spored rust first makes its appearance, and\r\nlater the bilocular \"mildew.\" It is by no means uncommon to find the\r\ntwo forms in the same pustule. Some have held, without good reason,\r\nthat the simple cells became afterwards divided and converted into\r\n_Puccinia_, but this is not the case; the uredo-spores are always\r\nsimple, and remain so except in _Uredo linearis_, where every\r\nintermediate stage has been observed. Both are also perfect in their\r\nkind, and capable of germination.\r\n\r\nWhat the precise relations between the two forms may be has as yet\r\nnever been revealed to observers, but that the two forms belong to one\r\nspecies is not now doubted. Very many species of _Puccinia_ have\r\nalready been found associated with a corresponding _Trichobasis_, and\r\nof _Phragmidium_ with a relative _Lecythea_, but it may be open to\r\ngrave doubt whether some of the very many species associated by\r\nauthors are not so classed upon suspicion rather than observation. We\r\nare ready to admit that the evidence is strong in favour of the\r\ndimorphism of a large number of species--it _may_ be in all, but this\r\nawaits proof, or substantial presumption on good grounds. Up to the\r\npresent we know that there are species of _Trichobasis_ which have\r\nnever been traced to association with a _Puccinia_, and doubtless\r\nthere will be species of _Puccinia_ for which no corresponding _Uredo_\r\nor _Trichobasis_ can be found.\r\n\r\nTulasne remarks, in reference to _Puccinia sonchi_, in one of his\r\nmemoirs, that this curious species exhibits, in effect, that a\r\n_Puccinia_ may unite three sorts of reproductive bodies, which, taking\r\npart, constitute for the mycologists of the day three entirely\r\ndifferent plants--a _Trichobasis_, a _Uromyces_, and a _Puccinia_. The\r\nUredines are not less rich, he adds, in reproductive bodies of divers\r\nsorts than the _Pyrenomycetes_ and the _Discomycetes_; and we should\r\nnot be surprised at this, since it seems to be a law, almost constant\r\nin the general harmony of nature, that the smaller the organized\r\nbeings are, the more their races are prolific.\r\n\r\nIn _Puccinia variabilis_, Grev., it is common to find a unicellular\r\nform, species of _Trichobasis_, in the same pustules. A like\r\ncircumstance occurs with _Puccinia violarum_, Link., and _Trichobasis\r\nviolarum_, B.; with _Puccinia fallens_, C., and _Trichobasis fallens_,\r\nDesm.; also with _Puccinia menthæ_, P., and _Trichobasis Labiatarum_,\r\nD. C. In _Melampsora_, again, the prismatic pseudospores of\r\n_Melampsora salicina_, Lev., are the winter fruits of _Lecythea\r\ncaprearum_, Lev., as those of _Melampsora populina_, Lev., are of\r\n_Lecythea populina_, Lev. In the species of _Lecythea_ themselves will\r\nbe found, as De Bary[C] has shown, hyaline cysts of a larger size,\r\nwhich surround the pseudospores in the pustules in which they are\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nA good illustration of dimorphism in one of the commonest of moulds is\r\ngiven by De Bary in a paper from which we have already quoted.[D] He\r\nwrites thus:--In every household there is a frequent unbidden guest,\r\nwhich appears particularly on preserved fruits, viz., the _mould_\r\nwhich is called _Aspergillus glaucus_. It shows itself to the naked\r\neye as a woolly floccy crust over the substance, first purely white,\r\nthen gradually covered with little fine glaucous, or dark green dusty\r\nheads. More minute microscopical examination shows that the fungus\r\nconsists of richly ramified fine filaments, which are partly\r\ndisseminated in the substratum, and partly raised obliquely over it.\r\nThey have a cylindrical form with rounded ends, and are divided into\r\nlong outstretched members, each of which possesses the property which\r\nlegitimatizes it as a vesicle in the ordinary sense of the word; it\r\ncontains, enclosed within a delicate structureless wall, those bodies\r\nwhich bear the appearance of a finely granulated mucous substance,\r\nwhich is designated by the name of protoplasm, and which either\r\nequally fills the cells, or the older the cell the more it is filled\r\nwith watery cavities called vacuoles.\r\n\r\nAll parts are at first colourless. The increase in the length of the\r\nfilaments takes place through the preponderating growth near their\r\npoints; these continually push forward, and, at a short distance from\r\nthem, successive new partitions rise up, but at a greater distance,\r\nthe growth in the length ceases. This kind of growth is called point\r\ngrowth. The twigs and branches spring up as lateral dilatations of\r\nthe principal filament, which, once designed, enlarges according to\r\nthe point growth. This point growth of every branch is, to a certain\r\nextent, unlimited. The filaments in and on the substratum are the\r\nfirst existing members of the fungus; they continue so long as it\r\nvegetates. As the parts which absorb nourishment from and consume the\r\nsubstance, they are called the _mycelium_. Nearly every fungus\r\npossesses a mycelium, which, without regard to the specific difference\r\nof form and size, especially shows the described nature in its\r\nconstruction and growth.\r\n\r\nThe superficial threads of the mycelium produce other filaments beside\r\nthose numerous branches which have been described, and which are the\r\nfruit thread (carpophore) or conidia thread. These are on an average\r\nthicker than the mycelium threads, and only exceptionally ramified or\r\nfurnished with partitions; they rise almost perpendicularly into the\r\nair, and attain a length of, on an average, half a millimetre, or\r\none-fiftieth of an inch, but they seldom become longer, and then their\r\ngrowth is at an end. Their free upper end swells in a rounded manner,\r\nand from this is produced, on the whole of its upper part, rayed\r\ndivergent protuberances, which attain an oval form, and a length\r\nalmost equal to their radius, or, in weaker specimens, the diameter of\r\nthe rounded head. The rayed divergent protuberances are the direct\r\nproducers and bearers of the propagating cells, spores, or conidia,\r\nand are called sterigmata. Every sterigma at first produces at its\r\npoint a little round protuberance, which, with a strong narrow basis,\r\nrests upon the sterigma. These are filled with protoplasm, swell more\r\nand more, and, after some time, separate themselves by a partition\r\nfrom the sterigma into independent cells, spores, or conidia.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the first spore takes place at the same end of the\r\nsterigma, and in the same manner a second follows, then a third, and\r\nso on; every one which springs up later pushes its predecessor in the\r\ndirection of the axis of the sterigma in the same degree in which it\r\ngrows itself; every successive spore formed from a sterigma remains\r\nfor a time in a row with one another. Consequently every sterigma\r\nbears on its apex a chain of spores, which are so much the older, the\r\nfarther they stand from the sterigma. The number of the links in a\r\nchain of spores reaches in normal specimens to ten or more. All\r\nsterigmata spring up at the same time, and keep pace with one another\r\nin the formation of the spores. Every spore grows for a time,\r\naccording to its construction, and at last separates itself from its\r\nneighbours. The mass of dismembered spores forms that fine glaucous\r\nhue which is mentioned above. The spores, therefore, are articulated\r\nin rows, one after the other, from the ends of the sterigmata. The\r\nripe spore, or conidium, is a cell of a round or broadly oval form,\r\nfilled with a colourless protoplasm, and, if observed separately, is\r\nfound to be provided with a brownish, finely verruculose, dotted\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--_a._ _Aspergillus glaucus_; _b._ conidia; _c._\r\ngerminating conidium; _d._ conceptacle of _Eurotium_; _e._ ascus.]\r\n\r\nThe same mycelium which forms the pedicel for the conidia when it is\r\nnear the end of its development, forms by normal vegetation a second\r\nkind of fructification. It begins as delicate thin little branches,\r\nwhich are not to be distinguished by the naked eye, and which mostly\r\nin four or six turns, after a quickly terminated growth, wind their\r\nends like a corkscrew. (Fig. 102.) The sinuations decrease in width\r\nmore and more, till they at last reach close to one another, and the\r\nwhole end changes from the form of a corkscrew into that of a hollow\r\nscrew. In and on that screw-like body, a change of a complicated kind\r\ntakes place, which is a productive process. In consequence of this,\r\nfrom the screw body a globose receptacle is formed, consisting of a\r\nthin wall of delicate cells, and a closely entwined row of cells\r\nsurrounded by this dense mass (_d_). By the enlargement of all these\r\nparts the round body grows so much, that by the time it is ripe it is\r\nvisible to the naked eye. The outer surface of the wall assumes a\r\ncompactness and a bright yellow colour; the greater part of the cells\r\nof the inner mass become asci for the formation of sporidia, while\r\nthey free themselves from the reciprocal union, take a broad oval\r\nform, and each one produces within its inner space eight sporidia\r\n(_e_). These soon entirely fill the ascus. When they are quite ripe,\r\nthe wall of the conceptacle becomes brittle, and from irregular\r\nfissures, arising easily from contact, the colourless round sporidia\r\nare liberated.\r\n\r\nThe pedicels of both kinds of fruit are formed from the same mycelium\r\nin the order just described. If we examine attentively, we can often\r\nsee both springing up close to one another from the same filament of a\r\nmycelium. This is not very easy in the close interlacing of the stalks\r\nof a mass of fungi in consequence of their delicacy and fragility.\r\nBefore their connection was known, the conceptacles and the conidia\r\npedicels were considered as organs of two very different species of\r\nfungi. The conceptacles were called _Eurotium herbariorum_, and the\r\nconidia bearers were called _Aspergillus glaucus_.\r\n\r\nAllied to _Eurotium_ is the group of _Erysiphei_, in which\r\nwell-authenticated polymorphy prevails. These fungi are developed\r\non the green parts of growing plants, and at first consist of a\r\nwhite mouldy stratum, composed of delicate mycelium, on which erect\r\nthreads are produced, which break up into subglobose joints or\r\nconidia. The species on grass was named _Oidium monilioides_\r\nbefore its relationship was known, but undoubtedly this is only the\r\nconidia of _Erysiphe graminis_. In like manner the vine disease\r\n(_Oidium Tuckeri_) is most probably only the conidia of a species of\r\n_Erysiphe_, of which the perfect condition has not yet been\r\ndiscovered. On roses the old _Oidium leucoconium_ is but the conidia\r\nof _Sphærotheca pannosa_, and so of other species. The _Erysiphe_\r\nwhich ultimately appears on the same mycelium consists of globose\r\nperithecia, externally furnished with thread-like appendages, and\r\ninternally with asci containing sporidia. In this genus there are\r\nno less than five different forms of fruit,[E] the multiform\r\nthreads on the mycelium, already alluded to as forms of _Oidium_, the\r\nasci contained in the sporangia, which is the proper fruit of the\r\n_Erysiphe_, larger stylospores which are produced in other\r\nsporangia, the smaller stylospores which are generated in the\r\npycnidia, and separate sporules which are sometimes formed in the\r\njoints of the necklaces of the conidia. These forms are figured in the\r\n\"Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany\" from _Sphærotheca Castagnei_,\r\nwhich is the hop mildew.[F] The vine disease, hop mildew, and rose\r\nmildew, are the most destructive species of this group, and the\r\nconstant annoyance of cultivators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--_Erysiphe cichoracearum._ _a._ Receptacle; _o._\r\nmycelium. (De Bary.)]\r\n\r\nWhen first describing an allied fungus found on old paper, and named\r\n_Ascotricha chartarum_, the Rev. M. J. Berkeley called attention to\r\nthe presence of globose conidia attached to the threads which surround\r\nthe conceptacles,[G] and this occurred as long since as 1838. In a\r\nrecent species of _Chætomium_ found on old sacking, _Chætomium\r\ngriseum_, Cooke,[H] we have found tufts in all respects similar\r\nexternally to the _Chætomium_, but no perithecium was formed, naked\r\nconidia being developed apparently at the base of the coloured\r\nthreads. In _Chætomium funicolum_, Cooke, a black mould was also found\r\nwhich may possibly prove to be its conidia, but at present there is no\r\ndirect evidence.\r\n\r\nThe brothers Tulasne have made us acquainted with a greater\r\nnumber of instances amongst the _Sphæriacei_ in which multiple\r\norgans of reproduction prevail. Very often old and decaying\r\nindividuals belonging to species of _Boletus_ will be found\r\nfilled, and their entire substance internally replaced, by the\r\nthreads and multitudinous spores of a golden yellow parasite, to\r\nwhich the name of _Sepedonium chrysospermum_ has been given.\r\nAccording to Tulasne, this is merely a condition of a sphæriaceous\r\nfungus belonging to his genus _Hypomyces_.[I]\r\n\r\nThe same observers also first demonstrated that _Trichoderma viride_,\r\nP., was but the conidia-bearing stage of _Hypocrea rufa_, P., another\r\nsphæriaceous fungus. The ascigerous stroma of the latter is indeed\r\nfrequently associated in a very close manner with the cushions of the\r\npretended _Trichoderma_, or in other cases the same stroma will give\r\nrise to a different apparatus of conidia, of which the principal\r\nelements are acicular filaments, which are short, upright, and almost\r\nsimple, and which give rise to small oval conidia which are solitary\r\non the tips of the threads. Therefore this _Hypocrea_ will possess two\r\ndifferent kinds of conidia, as is the case in many species of\r\n_Hypomyces_.\r\n\r\nA most familiar instance of dualism will be found in _Nectria\r\ncinnabarina_, of which the conidia form is one of the most common of\r\nfungi, forming little reddish nodules on all kinds of dead twigs.[J]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Twig with _Tubercularia_ on the upper portion,\r\n_Nectria_ on the lower.]\r\n\r\nAlmost any small currant twig which has been lying on the ground in a\r\ndamp situation will afford an opportunity of studying this phenomenon.\r\nThe whole surface of the twig will be covered from end to end with\r\nlittle bright pink prominences, bursting through the bark at regular\r\ndistances, scarcely a quarter of an inch apart. Towards one end of the\r\ntwig probably the prominences will be of a deeper, richer colour, like\r\npowdered cinnabar. The naked eye is sufficient to detect some\r\ndifference between the two kinds of pustules, and where the two merge\r\ninto each other specks of cinnabar will be visible on the pink\r\nprojections. By removing the bark it will be seen that the pink bodies\r\nhave a sort of paler stem, which spreads above into a somewhat globose\r\nhead, covered with a delicate mealy bloom. At the base it penetrates\r\nto the inner bark, and from it the threads of mycelium branch in all\r\ndirections, confined, however, to the bark, and not entering the woody\r\ntissues beneath. The head, placed under examination, will be found to\r\nconsist of delicate parallel threads compacted together to form the\r\nstem and head. Some of these threads are simple, others are branched,\r\nbearing here and there upon them delicate little bodies, which are\r\nreadily detached, and which form the mealy bloom which covers the\r\nsurface. These are the conidia, little slender cylindrical bodies,\r\nrounded at the ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Section of _Tubercularia_. _c._ Threads with\r\nconidia.[K]]\r\n\r\nPassing to the other bodies, which are of a deeper colour, it will\r\nsoon be discovered that, instead of being simple rounded heads, each\r\ntubercle is composed of numerous smaller, nearly globose bodies,\r\nclosely packed together, often compressed, all united to a base\r\nclosely resembling the base of the other tubercles. If for a moment we\r\nlook at one of the tubercles near the spot where the crimson\r\ntubercles seem to merge into the pink, we shall not only find them\r\nparticoloured, but that the red points are the identical globose\r\nlittle heads just observed in clusters. This will lead to the\r\nsuspicion, which can afterwards be verified, that the red heads\r\nare really produced on the stem or stroma of the pink tubercles.\r\n\r\nA section of one of the red tubercles will show us how much the\r\ninternal structure differs. The little subglobose bodies which spring\r\nfrom a common stroma or stem are hollow shells or capsules, externally\r\ngranular, internally filled with a gelatinous nucleus. They are,\r\nindeed, the perithecia of a sphæriaceous fungus of the genus\r\n_Nectria_, and the gelatinous nucleus contains the fructification.\r\nStill further examination will show that this fructification consists\r\nof cylindrical asci, each enclosing eight elliptical sporidia, closely\r\npacked together, and mixed with slender threads called paraphyses.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have undoubted evidence of _Nectria cinnabarina_, with\r\nits fruit, produced in asci growing from the stroma or stem, and in\r\nintimate relationship with what was formerly named _Tubercularia\r\nvulgaris_. A fungus with two forms of fruit, one proper to the pink,\r\nor _Tubercularia_ form, with naked slender conidia, the other proper\r\nto the mature fungus, enclosed in asci, and generated within the walls\r\nof a perithecium. Instances of this kind are now known to be far from\r\nuncommon, although they cannot always, or often, be so clearly and\r\ndistinctly traced as in the illustration which we have selected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--D. _Nectria_ surrounding _Tubercularia_; E.\r\ntuft of _Nectria cinnabarina_; F. section of stroma; G. ascus and\r\nparaphyses.]\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for the conidia of the _Sphæria_ to partake of the\r\ncharacteristics of a mould, and then the perithecia are developed\r\namongst the conidial threads. A recently recorded instance of this\r\nrelates to _Sphæria Epochnii_, B. and Br.,[L] the conidia form of\r\nwhich was long known before the _Sphæria_ related to it was\r\ndiscovered, under the name of _Epochnium fungorum_. The _Epochnium_\r\nforms a thin stratum, which overruns various species of _Corticium_.\r\nThe conidia are at first uniseptate. The perithecia of the _Sphæria_\r\nare at first pale bottle-green, crowded in the centre of the\r\n_Epochnium_, then black green granulated, sometimes depressed at the\r\nsummit, with a minute pore. The sporidia are strongly constricted in\r\nthe centre, at first uniseptate, with two nuclei in each division.\r\n\r\nAnother _Sphæria_ in which the association is undoubted is the\r\n_Sphæria aquila_, Fr.,[M] which is almost always found nestling in a\r\nwoolly brown subiculum, for the most part composed of barren brown\r\njointed threads. These threads, however, produce, under favourable\r\nconditions, mostly before the perfection of the perithecia, minute\r\nsubglobose conidia, and in this state constitute what formerly bore\r\nthe name of _Sporotrichum fuscum_, Link., but now recognized as the\r\nconidia of _Sphæria aquila_.\r\n\r\nIn _Sphæria nidulans_, Schw., a North American species, we have more\r\nthan once found the dark brown subiculum bearing large triseptate\r\nconidia, having all the characters of the genus _Helminthosporium_. In\r\n_Sphæria pilosa_, P., Messrs. Berkeley and Broome have observed oblong\r\nconidia, rather irregular in outline, terminating the hairs of the\r\nperithecium.[N] The same authors have also figured the curious\r\npentagonal conidia springing from flexuous threads accompanying\r\n_Sphæria felina_, Fckl.,[O] and also the threads resembling those of a\r\n_Cladotrichum_ with the angular conidia of _Sphæria cupulifera_, B.\r\nand Br.[P] A most remarkable example is also given by the Brothers\r\nTulasne in _Pleospora polytricha_, in which the conidia-bearing\r\nthreads not only surround, but grow upon the perithecia, and are\r\ncrowned by fascicles of septate conidia.[Q]\r\n\r\nInstances of this kind have now become so numerous that only a few can\r\nbe cited as examples of the rest. It is not at all improbable that the\r\nmajority of what are now classed together as species under the genus\r\nof black moulds, _Helminthosporium_, will at some not very distant\r\nperiod be traced as the conidia of different species of ascomycetous\r\nfungi. The same fate may also await other allied genera, but until\r\nthis association is established, they must keep the rank and position\r\nwhich has been assigned to them.\r\n\r\nAnother form of dualism, differing somewhat in character from the\r\nforegoing, finds illustration in the sphæriaceous genus _Melanconis_,\r\nof Tulasne, in which the free spores are still called conidia, though\r\nin most instances produced in a sort of spurious conceptaculum, or\r\nborne on short threads from a kind of cushion-shaped stroma. In the\r\n_Melanconis stilbostoma_,[R] there are three forms, one of slender\r\nminute bodies, oozing out in the form of yellow tendrils, which may be\r\nspermatia, formerly called _Nemaspora crocea_. Then there are the oval\r\nbrown or olive brown conidia, which are at first covered, then oozing\r\nout in a black pasty mass, formerly _Melanconium bicolor_, and finally\r\nthe sporidia in asci of _Sphæria stilbostoma_, Fries. In _Melanconis\r\nBerkeleii_, Tul., the conidia are quadrilocular, previously known as\r\n_Stilbospora macrosperma_, B. and Br. In a closely-allied species from\r\nNorth America, _Melanconis bicornis_, Cooke, the appendiculate\r\nsporidia are similar, and the conidia would also appear to partake of\r\nthe character of _Stilbospora_. We may remark here that we have seen a\r\nbrown mould, probably an undescribed species of _Dematiei_, growing in\r\ndefinite patches around the openings in birch bark caused by the\r\ncrumpent ostiola of the perithecia of _Melanconis stilbostoma_, from\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn _Melanconis lanciformis_,[S] Tul., there are, it would appear,\r\nfour forms of fruit. One of these consists of conidia, characterized\r\nby Corda as _Coryneum disciforme_.[T] Stylospores, which are also\r\nfigured by Corda under the name of _Coniothecium betulinum_;\r\npycnidia,[U] first discovered by Berkeley and Broome, and named by\r\nthem _Hendersonia polycystis_;[V] and the ascophorous fruits which\r\nconstituted the _Sphæria lanciformis_ of Fries. Mr. Currey indicated\r\n_Hendersonia polycystis_, B. and Br., as a form of fruit of this\r\nspecies in a communication to the Royal Society in 1857.[W] He says\r\nthis plant grows upon birch, and is in perfection in very moist\r\nweather, when it may be recognized by the large black soft\r\ngelatinous protuberances on the bark, formed by spores escaping and\r\ndepositing themselves upon and about the apex of the perithecium.\r\nThis I suspect to be an abnormal state of a well-known Sphæria (_S.\r\nlanciformis_), which grows upon birch, and upon birch only.\r\n\r\nWe might multiply, almost indefinitely, instances amongst the\r\n_Sphæriacei_, but have already given sufficient for illustration, and\r\nwill therefore proceed briefly to notice some instances amongst the\r\n_Discomycetes_, which also bear their complete or perfect fruit in\r\nasci.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful purple stipitate cups of _Bulgaria sarcoides_, which may\r\nbe seen flourishing in the autumn on old rotten wood, are often\r\naccompanied by club-shaped bodies of the same colour; or earlier in\r\nthe season these clavate bodies may be found alone, and at one time\r\nbore the name of _Tremella sarcoides_. The upper part of these clubs\r\ndisseminate a great abundance of straight and very slender spermatia.\r\nEarlier than this they are covered with globose conidia. The\r\nfully-matured _Bulgaria_ develops on its hymenium clavate delicate\r\nasci, each enclosing eight elongated hyaline sporidia, so that we have\r\nthree forms of fruit belonging to the same fungus, viz. conidia and\r\nspermatia in the _Tremella_ stage, and sporidia contained in asci in\r\nthe mature condition.[X] The same phenomena occur with _Bulgaria\r\npurpurea_, a larger species with different fruit, long confounded with\r\n_Bulgaria sarcoides_.\r\n\r\nOn the dead stems of nettles it is very common to meet with small\r\norange tubercles, not much larger than a pin's head, which yield at\r\nthis stage a profusion of slender linear bodies, produced on delicate\r\nbranched threads, and at one time bore the name of _Dacrymyces\r\nUrticæ_, but which are now acknowledged to be only a condition of a\r\nlittle tremelloid _Peziza_ of the same size and colour, which might be\r\nmistaken for it, if not examined with the microscope, but in which\r\nthere are distinct asci and sporidia. Both forms together are now\r\nregarded as the same fungus, under the name of _Peziza fusarioides_,\r\nB.\r\n\r\nThe other series of phenomena grouped together under the name of\r\npolymorphism relate to forms which are removed from each other, so\r\nthat the mycelium is not identical, or, more usually, produced on\r\ndifferent plants. The first instance of this kind to which we shall\r\nmake reference is one of particular interest, as illustrative of the\r\nold popular creed, that berberry bushes near corn-fields produced\r\nmildewed corn. There is a village in Norfolk, not far from Great\r\nYarmouth, called \"Mildew Rollesby,\" because of its unenviable\r\nnotoriety in days past for mildewed corn, produced, it was said, by\r\nthe berberry bushes, which were cut down, and then mildew disappeared\r\nfrom the corn-fields, so that Rollesby no longer merited its\r\n_sobriquet_. It has already been shown that the corn-mildew (_Puccinia\r\ngraminis_) is dimorphous, having a one-celled fruit (_Trichobasis_),\r\nas well as a two-celled fruit (_Puccinia_). The fungus which attacks\r\nthe berberry is a species of cluster-cup (_Æcidium berberidis_), in\r\nwhich little cup-like peridia, containing bright orange pseudospores,\r\nare produced in tufts or clusters on the green leaves, together with\r\ntheir spermogonia.\r\n\r\nDe Bary's observations on this association of forms were published in\r\n1865.[Y] In view of the popular belief, he determined to sow the\r\nspores of _Puccinia graminis_ on the leaves of the berberry. For this\r\npurpose he selected the septate resting spores from _Poa pratensis_\r\nand _Triticum repens_. Having caused the spores to germinate in a\r\nmoist atmosphere, he placed fragments of the leaves on which they had\r\ndeveloped their secondary spores on young but full-grown berberry\r\nleaves, under the same atmospheric conditions. In from twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours a quantity of the germinating threads had bored\r\nthrough the walls and penetrated amongst the subjacent cells. This\r\ntook place both on the upper and under surface of the leaves. Since,\r\nin former experiments, it appeared that the spores would penetrate\r\nonly in those cases where the plant was adapted to develop the\r\nparasite, the connection between _P. graminis_ and _Æcid. berberidis_\r\nseemed more than ever probable. In about ten days the spermogonia\r\nappeared. After a time the cut leaves began to decay, so that the\r\nfungus never got beyond the spermogonoid stage. Some three-year-old\r\nseedlings were then taken, and the germinating resting spores applied\r\nas before. The plants were kept under a bell-glass from twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours, and then exposed to the air like other plants. From\r\nthe sixth to the tenth day, yellow spots appeared, with single\r\nspermogonia; from the ninth to the twelfth, spermogonia appeared in\r\nnumbers on either surface; and, a few days later, on the under surface\r\nof the leaves, the cylindrical sporangia of the _Æcidium_ made their\r\nappearance, exactly as in the normally developed parasite, except that\r\nthey were longer, from being protected from external agents. The\r\nyounger the leaves, the more rapid was the development of the\r\nparasite, and sometimes, in the younger leaves, the luxuriance was far\r\ngreater than in free nature. Similar plants, to the number of two\r\nhundred, were observed in the nursery, and though some of them had\r\n_Æcidium_ pustules, not one fresh pustule was produced; while two\r\nplaced under similar circumstances, but without the application of any\r\nresting spores, remained all the summer free from _Æcidium_. It seems,\r\nthen, indubitable so far that _Æcidium berberidis_ does spring from\r\nthe spores of _Puccinia graminis_.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, to be remarked that De Bary was not equally\r\nsuccessful in producing the _Puccinia_ from the spores of the\r\n_Æcidium_. In many cases the spores do not germinate when placed on\r\nglass, and they do not preserve their power of germinating very long.\r\nHe reverts then to the evidence of experiments instituted by\r\nagriculturists. Bönninghausen remarked, in 1818, that wheat, rye, and\r\nbarley which were sown in the neighbourhood of a berberry bush covered\r\nwith _Æcidium_ contracted rust immediately after the maturation of the\r\nspores of the _Æcidia_. The rust was most abundant where the wind\r\ncarried the spores. The following year the same observations were\r\nrepeated; the spores of the _Æcidium_ were collected, and applied to\r\nsome healthy plants of rye. After five or six days these plants were\r\naffected with rust, while the remainder of the crop was sound. In\r\n1863 some winter rye was sown round a berberry bush, which in the\r\nfollowing year was infested with _Æcidium_, which was mature in the\r\nmiddle of May, when the rye was completely covered with rust. Of the\r\nwild grasses near the bush, _Triticum repens_ was most affected. The\r\ndistant plants of rye were free from rust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Cells and pseudospores of _Æcidium berberidis_.]\r\n\r\nThe spores of the _Æcidium_ would not germinate on berberry leaves;\r\nthe berberry _Æcidium_ could not therefore spring from the previous\r\n_Æcidium_. The uredospores of _Puccinia graminis_ on germinating\r\npenetrate into the parenchym of the grass on which they are sown; but\r\non berberry leaves, if the tips of the threads enter for a short\r\ndistance into the stomates their growth at once ceases, and the leaves\r\nremain free from parasites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Cells and pseudospores of _Æcidium graveolens_.]\r\n\r\nMontagne has, however, described a _Puccinia berberidis_ on leaves of\r\n_Berberis glauca_ from Chili, which grows in company with _Æcidium\r\nberberidis_. This at first sight seems to contradict the above\r\nconclusions; but the _Æcidium_ which from the same disc produces the\r\npuccinoid resting spores, appears to be different from the European\r\nspecies, inasmuch as the cells of the wall of the sporangium are twice\r\nas large, and the spores decidedly of greater diameter.[Z] The resting\r\nspores, moreover, differ not only from those of _Puccinia graminis_,\r\nbut from those of all other European species.\r\n\r\nFrom this account, then, it is extremely probable that the _Æcidium_\r\nof the berberry enters into the cycle of existence of _Puccinia\r\ngraminis_, and, if this be true, wherefore should not other species\r\nof _Puccinia_ be related in like manner to other _Æcidia_? This is the\r\nconclusion to which many have arrived, and, taking advantage of\r\ncertain presumptions, have, we fear, rashly associated many such\r\nforms together without substantial evidence. On the leaves of the\r\nprimrose we have commonly a species of _Æcidium_, _Puccinia_, and\r\n_Uromyces_ nearly at the same time; we may imagine that all these\r\nbelong to one cycle, but it has not yet been proved. Again, _Uromyces\r\ncacaliæ_, Unger, _Uredo cacaliæ_, Unger, and _Æcidium cacaliæ_,\r\nThumen, are considered by Heufler[a] to form one cycle. Numerous\r\nothers are given by Fuckel,[b] and De Bary, in the same memoir from\r\nwhich we have already cited, notes _Uromyces appendiculatus_, Link.,\r\n_U. phaseolorum_, Tul., and _Puccinia tragopogonis_, Ca., as\r\npossessing five kinds of reproductive organs. Towards the end of the\r\nyear, shortly stipitate spores appear on their stroma, which do not\r\nfall off. These spores, which do not germinate till after a shorter\r\nor longer winter rest, may conveniently be called resting spores, or,\r\nas De Bary calls them, _teleutospores_, being the last which are\r\nproduced. These at length germinate, become articulated, and produce\r\novate or kidney-shaped spores, which in their turn germinate,\r\npenetrating the cuticle of the mother plant, avoiding the stomates or\r\napertures by which it breathes. After about two or three weeks,\r\nthe mycelium, which has ramified among the tissues, produces an\r\n_Æcidium_, with its constant companion, spermogonia--distinct cysts,\r\nthat is, from which a quantity of minute bodies ooze out, often in\r\nthe form of a tendril, the function of which is imperfectly known at\r\npresent, but which from analogy we regard as a form of fruit,\r\nthough it is just possible that they may be rather of the nature of\r\nspermatozoids. The _Æcidia_ contain, within a cellular membranous\r\nsac, a fructifying disc, which produces necklaces of spores, which\r\nultimately separate from each other in the form of a granular powder.\r\nThe grains of which it is composed germinate in their turn, no\r\nlonger avoiding the stomates as before, but penetrating through\r\ntheir aperture into the parenchym. The new resultant mycelium\r\nreproduces the _Uredo_, or fifth form of fructification, and the\r\n_Uredo_ spores fall off like those of the _Æcidium_, and in respect of\r\ngermination, and mode of penetration, present precisely the same\r\nphenomena. The disc which has produced the _Uredo_ spores now gives\r\nrise to the resting spores, and so the cycle is complete.[c]\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Oersted, of Copenhagen, was of opinion that he had\r\ndemonstrated the polymorphy of the Tremelloid Uredines, and satisfied\r\nhimself that the one condition known as _Podisoma_ was but another\r\nstage of _Roestelia_.[d] Some freshly gathered specimens of\r\n_Gymnosporangium_ were damped with water, and during the night\r\nfollowing the spores germinated profusely, so that the teleutospores\r\nformed an orange-coloured powder. A little of this powder was\r\nplaced on the leaves of five small sorbs, which were damped and\r\nplaced under bell-glasses. In five days yellow spots were seen on\r\nthe leaves, and in two days more indications of spermogonia. The\r\nspermatia were discharged, and in two months from the first\r\nsowing, the peridia of _Roestelia_ appeared, and were developed.\r\n\"This trial of spores,\" says Oersted, \"has conduced to the result\r\nexpected, and proves that the teleutospores of _Gymnosporangium_,\r\nwhen transported upon the sorb, give rise to a totally different\r\nfungus, the _Roestelia cornuta_, that is to say, that an alternate\r\ngeneration comes between these fungi. They appertain in consequence\r\nto a single species, and the _Gymnosporangium_ ceased to be an\r\nindependent species, and must be considered as synonymous with the\r\nfirst generation of _Roestelia_. The spores have been transported\r\nupon young shoots of the juniper-tree, and have now commenced to\r\nproduce some mycelium in the bark. There is no doubt that in next\r\nspring it will result in _Gymnosporangium_.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently the same learned professor instituted similar experiments\r\nupon other hosts, with the spores of _Podisoma_, and from thence he\r\nconcluded that _Roestelia_ and _Podisoma_, in all their known species,\r\nwere but forms the one of the other. Hitherto we are not aware that\r\nthese results have been confirmed, or that the sowing of the spores of\r\n_Roestelia_ on juniper resulted in _Podisoma_. Such experiments should\r\nbe received always with care, and not too hastily accepted in their\r\napparent results as proven facts. Who shall say that _Roestelia_ would\r\nnot have appeared on _Sorbus_ within two months without the sowing of\r\n_Podisoma_ spores?--because it is not by any means uncommon for that\r\nfungus to appear upon that plant. It is true many mycologists write\r\nand speak of _Roestelia_ and _Podisoma_ (or _Gymnosporangium_) as\r\nidentical; but, as we think, without the evidence being so complete as\r\nto be beyond suspicion. It is, nevertheless, a curious fact that in\r\nEurope the number of species of _Roestelia_ and _Podisoma_ are equal,\r\nif one species be excluded, which is certainly not a good _Podisoma_,\r\nfor the reception of which a new genus has been proposed.[e]\r\n\r\nAmongst the ascigerous fungi will be found a curious but interesting\r\ngenus formerly called _Cordyceps_, but for which Tulasne, in\r\nconsequence of the discovery of secondary forms of fruit, has\r\nsubstituted that of _Torrubia_.[f] These curious fungi partake more\r\nor less of a clavate form, and are parasitic on insects. The pupæ\r\nof moths are sometimes seen bearing upon them the white branched\r\nmould, something like a _Clavaria_ in appearance, to which the name of\r\n_Isaria farinosa_ has been given. According to Tulasne, this is the\r\nconidia form of the bright scarlet, club-shaped body which is also\r\nfound on dead pupæ, called _Torrubia militaris_. An American mould of\r\nthe same genus, _Isaria sphingum_, found on mature moths,[g] is in\r\nlike manner declared to be the conidia of _Torrubia sphingum_;\r\nwhereas a similar mould, found on dead spiders, called _Isaria\r\narachnophila_,[h] is probably of a similar nature. An allied kind\r\nof compact mould, which is parasitic on _Cocci_, on the bark of\r\ntrees, recently found in England by Mr. C. E. Broome, and named\r\n_Microcera coccophila_,[i] is said by Tulasne to be a condition of\r\n_Sphærostilbe_, and it is intimated that other productions of a\r\nsimilar character bear like relations to other sphæriaceous fungi.\r\nFor many species of _Torrubia_ no corresponding conidia are yet\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nSome instances might be noted, not without interest, in which the\r\nfacts of dimorphism or polymorphism have not been satisfactorily\r\nproved, but final judgment is held in suspense until suspicion is\r\nreplaced by conviction. Some years since, a quantity of dead box\r\nleaves were collected, on which flourished at the time a mould named\r\n_Penicillium roseum_. This mould has a roseate tint, and occurs in\r\npatches on the dead leaves lying upon the ground; the threads are\r\nerect and branched above, bearing chains of oblong, somewhat\r\nspindle-shaped spores, or, perhaps more accurately, conidia. When\r\ncollected, these leaves were examined, and nothing was observed or\r\nnoted upon them except this _Penicillium_. After some time, certainly\r\nbetween two and three years, during which period the box remained\r\nundisturbed, circumstances led to the examination again of one or two\r\nof the leaves, and afterwards of the greater number of them, when the\r\npatches of _Penicillium_ were found to be intermixed with another\r\nmould of a higher development, and far different character. This\r\nmould, or rather _Mucor_, consists of erect branching threads, many of\r\nthe branches terminating in a delicate globose, glassy head, or\r\nsporangium, containing numerous very minute subglobose sporidia. This\r\nspecies was named _Mucor hyalinus_.[j] The habit is very much like\r\nthat of the _Penicillium_, but without any roseate tint. It is almost\r\ncertain that the _Mucor_ could not have been present when the\r\n_Penicillium_ was examined, and the leaves on which it had grown were\r\nenclosed in the tin box, but that the _Mucor_ afterwards appeared on\r\nthe same leaves, sometimes from the same patches, and, as it would\r\nappear, from the same mycelium. The great difference in the two\r\nspecies lies in the fructification. In the _Penicillium_, the spores\r\nare naked, and in moniliform threads; whilst in _Mucor_ the spores are\r\nenclosed within globose membraneous heads or sporangia. Scarcely can\r\nwe doubt that the _Mucor_ alluded to above, found thus intermixed,\r\nunder peculiar circumstances, with _Penicillium roseum_, is no other\r\nthan the higher and more complete form of that species, and that the\r\n_Penicillium_ is only its conidiiferous state. The presumption in this\r\ncase is strong, and not so open to suspicion as it would be did not\r\nanalogy render it so extremely probable that such is the case, apart\r\nfrom the fact of both forms springing from the same mass of mycelium.\r\nIn such minute and delicate structures it is very difficult to\r\nmanipulate the specimens so as to arrive at positive evidence. If a\r\nfilament of mycelium could be isolated successfully, and a fertile\r\nthread, bearing the fruit of each form, could be traced from the same\r\nindividual mycelium thread, the evidence would be conclusive. In\r\ndefault of such conclusive evidence, we are compelled to rest with\r\nassumption until further researches enable us to record the assumption\r\nas fact.[k]\r\n\r\nApropos of this very connection of _Penicillium_ with _Mucor_, a\r\nsimilar suspicion attaches to an instance noted by a wholly\r\ndisinterested observer to this effect. \"On a preparation preserved in\r\na moist chamber, on the third day a white speck was seen on the\r\nsurface, consisting of innumerable 'yeast' cells, with some filaments,\r\nbranching in all directions. On the fourth day tufts of _Penicillium_,\r\nhad developed two varieties--_P. glaucum_ and _P. viride_. This\r\ncontinued until the ninth day, when a few of the filaments springing\r\nup in the midst of the _Penicillium_ were tipped with a dewdrop-like\r\ndilatation, excessively delicate--a mere distended pellicle. In some\r\ncases they seemed to be derived from the same filament as others\r\nbearing the ordinary branching spores of _Penicillium_, but of this I\r\ncould not be positive. This kind of fructification increased rapidly,\r\nand on the fourteenth day spores had undoubtedly developed within the\r\npellicle, just as had been observed in a previous cultivation,\r\nprecisely similar revolving movements being also manifested.\"[l]\r\nAlthough we have here another instance of _Mucor_ and _Penicillium_\r\ngrowing in contact, the evidence is insufficient to warrant more than\r\na suspicion of their identity, inasmuch as the equally minute spores\r\nof _Mucor_ and _Penicillium_ might have mingled, and each producing\r\nits kind, no relationship whatever have existed between them, except\r\ntheir development from the same matrix.\r\n\r\nAnother case of association--for the evidence does not proceed\r\nfurther--was recorded by us, in which a dark-coloured species of\r\n_Penicillium_ was closely associated with what we now believe to be a\r\nspecies of _Macrosporium_--but then designated a _Sporidesmium_--and a\r\nminute _Sphæria_ growing in succession on damp wall-paper. Association\r\nis all that the _facts_ warrant us in calling it.\r\n\r\nWe cannot forbear alluding to one of the species of _Sphæria_ to which\r\nTulasne[m] attributes a variety of forms of fruit, and we do so here\r\nbecause we think that a circumstance so extraordinary should be\r\nconfirmed before it is accepted as absolutely true. This refers to the\r\ncommon _Sphæria_ found on herbaceous plants, known as _Sphæria_\r\n(_Pleospora_) _herbarum_. First of all the very common mould called\r\n_Cladosporium herbarum_ is constituted as conidia, and of this again\r\n_Macrosporium sarcinula_, Berk., is considered to be another\r\ncondition. In the next place, _Cytispora orbicularis_, Berk., and\r\n_Phoma herbarum_, West., are regarded as pycnidia, enclosing\r\nstylospores. Then _Alternaria tenuis_, Pr.,[n] which is said to be\r\nparasitic on _Cladosporium herbarum_, is held to be only a form of\r\nthat species, so that here we have (including the _perithecia_) no\r\nless than six forms or phases for the same fungus. As _Macrosporium\r\nCheiranthi_, Pr., often is found in company with _Cladosporium\r\nherbarum_, that is also open to suspicion.\r\n\r\nWe have adduced in the foregoing pages a few instances which will\r\nserve to illustrate the polymorphism of fungi. Some of these it will\r\nbe observed are accepted as beyond doubt, occurring as they do in\r\nintimate relationship with each other. Others are considered as\r\nscarcely so well established, but probable, although developed\r\nsometimes on different species of plants. Finally, some are regarded\r\nas hitherto not satisfactorily proved, or, it may be, only suspicious.\r\nIn this latter group, however much probability may be in their favour,\r\nit can hardly be deemed philosophical to accept them on such slender\r\nevidence as in some cases alone is afforded. It would not have been\r\ndifficult to have extended the latter group considerably by the\r\naddition of instances enumerated by various mycologists in their works\r\nwithout any explanation of the data upon which their conclusions have\r\nbeen founded. In fact, altogether this chapter must be accepted as\r\nillustrative and suggestive, but by no means as exhaustive.\r\n\r\n   [A] De Bary, in \"Quarterly German Magazine\" (1872), p. 197.\r\n\r\n   [B] The method pursued by Messrs.

It may be that in some directions\r\nthese influences are exaggerated; but it is certain that on the whole\r\ntheir influence is far more important for evil and for good than that\r\nof any other of the Cryptogamia. In our endeavour to estimate the\r\ncharacter and extent of these influences it will prove advantageous to\r\nexamine them under three sections. 1. Their influence on man. 2. Their\r\ninfluence on lower animals. 3. Their influence on vegetation. Under\r\nthese sections the chief facts may be grouped, and some approximate\r\nidea obtained of the very great importance of this family of inferior\r\nplants, and consequently the advisability of pursuing their study more\r\nthoroughly and nationally than has hitherto been done.\r\n\r\nI. In estimating the influence of fungi upon man, we naturally enough\r\nseek in the first instance to know what baneful effects they are\r\ncapable of producing on food. Although in the case of \"poisonous\r\nfungi,\" popularly understood, fungi may be the passive agents, yet\r\nthey cannot be ignored in an inquiry of this nature. Writing of the\r\nUses of Fungi, we have already shown that a large number are available\r\nfor food, and some of these real delicacies; so, on the other hand, it\r\nbecomes imperative, even with stronger emphasis, to declare that many\r\nare poisonous, and some of them virulently so. It is not sufficient to\r\nsay that they are perfectly harmless until voluntarily introduced into\r\nthe human system, whilst it is well known that accidents are always\r\npossible, and probably would be if every baneful fungus had the word\r\nPOISON inscribed in capitals on its pileus.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is constantly being made as to what plain rules can be\r\ngiven for distinguishing poisonous from edible fungi, and we can\r\nanswer only that there are none other than those which apply to\r\nflowering plants. How can aconite, henbane, oenanthe, stramonium,\r\nand such plants, be distinguished from parsley, sorrel, watercress,\r\nor spinach? Manifestly not by any general characters, but by\r\nspecific differences. And so it is with the fungi. We must learn to\r\ndiscriminate _Agaricus muscarius_ from _Agaricus rubescens_, in the\r\nsame manner as we would discriminate parsley from _Æthusa cynapium_.\r\nIndeed, fungi have an advantage in this respect, since one or two\r\ngeneral cautions can be given, when none such are applicable for\r\nhigher plants. For instance, it may be said truly that all fungi\r\nthat exhibit a rapid change to blue when bruised or broken should\r\nbe avoided; that all Agarics are open to suspicion which possess an\r\nacrid taste; that fungi found growing on wood should not be eaten\r\nunless the species is well known; that no species of edible fungus\r\nhas a strong, unpleasant odour, and similar cautions, which, after\r\nall, are insufficient. The only safe guide lies in mastering, one by\r\none, the specific distinctions, and increasing the number of one's\r\nown esculents gradually, by dint of knowledge and experience, even as\r\na child learns to distinguish a filbert from an acorn, or with\r\nwider experience will thrust in his mouth a leaf of _Oxalis_ and\r\nreject that of the white clover.\r\n\r\nOne of the most deleterious of fungi that we possess is at the same\r\ntime one of the most beautiful. This is the _Agaricus muscarius_, or\r\nFly Agaric, which is sometimes used as a fly poison.[A] It has a\r\nbright crimson pileus studded with pale whitish (sometimes yellowish)\r\nwarts, and a stem and gills of ivory whiteness. Many instances have\r\nbeen recorded of poisoning by this fungus, and amongst them some\r\nBritish soldiers abroad, and yet it cannot be doubted that this fungus\r\nis eaten in Russia. Two instances have come under our notice of\r\npersons with some botanical knowledge, and one a gardener, who had\r\nresided in Russia and eaten of this fungus. In one case the Fly Agaric\r\nwas collected and shown to us, and in the other the figure was\r\nindicated, so that we might be under no doubt as to the species. Only\r\none hypothesis can be advanced in explanation. It is known that a\r\nlarge number of fungi are eaten in Russia, and that they enter much\r\ninto the domestic cookery of the peasantry, but it is also known that\r\nthey pay considerable attention to the mode of cooking, and add a\r\nlarge amount of salt and vinegar, both of which, with long boiling,\r\nmust be powerful agents in counteracting the poison (probably somewhat\r\nvolatile) of such fungi as the Fly Agaric. In this place we may give a\r\nrecipe published by a French author of a process for rendering\r\npoisonous fungi edible. It must be taken on his authority, and not our\r\nown, as we have never made the experiment, notwithstanding it seems\r\nsomewhat feasible:--For each pound of mushrooms, cut into moderately\r\nsmall pieces, take a quart of water acidulated with two or three\r\nspoonfuls of vinegar, or two spoonfuls of bay salt. Leave the\r\nmushrooms to macerate in the liquid for two hours, then wash them with\r\nplenty of water; this done, put them in cold water and make them boil.\r\nAfter a quarter or half hour's boiling take them off and wash them,\r\nthen drain, and prepare them either as a special dish, or use them for\r\nseasoning in the same manner as other species.[B]\r\n\r\nThis method is said to have been tried successfully with some of the\r\nmost dangerous kinds. Of these may be mentioned the emetic mushroom,\r\n_Russula emetica_, with a bright red pileus and white gills, which\r\nhas a clear, waxy, tempting appearance, but which is so virulent that\r\na small portion is sufficient to produce disagreeable consequences. It\r\nwould be safer to eschew all fungi with a red or crimson pileus than\r\nto run the risk of indulging in this. A white species, which, however,\r\nis not very common, with a bulbous base enclosed in a volva, called\r\n_Agaricus vernus_, should also be avoided. The pink spored species\r\nshould also be regarded with suspicion. Of the _Boleti_ several turn\r\nblue when cut or broken, and these again require to be discarded. This\r\nis especially the case with _Boletus luridus_[C] and _Boletus\r\nSatanas_,[D] two species which have the under surface or orifice of\r\nthe pores of a vermilion or blood-red colour.\r\n\r\nNot only are species which are known to be poisonous to be avoided,\r\nbut discretion should be used in eating recognized good species. Fungi\r\nundergo chemical changes so rapidly that even the cultivated mushroom\r\nmay cause inconvenience if kept so long after being gathered as to\r\nundergo chemical change. It is not enough that they should be of a\r\ngood kind, but also fresh. The employment of plenty of salt in their\r\npreparation is calculated very much to neutralize any deleterious\r\nproperty. Salt, pepper, and vinegar are much more freely employed\r\nabroad in preparing fungi than with us, and with manifest advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that fungi exert an important influence in\r\nskin diseases. This seems to be admitted on all hands by medical\r\nmen,[E] however much they may differ on the question of the extent to\r\nwhich they are the cause or consequence of disease. Facts generally\r\nseem to bear out the opinion that a great number of skin diseases\r\nare aggravated, and even produced, by fungi. Robin[F] insists that a\r\npeculiar soil is necessary, and Dr. Fox says it is usually taught\r\nthat tuberculous, scrofulous, and dirty people furnish the best\r\nnidus. It is scarcely necessary to enumerate all these diseases,\r\nwith which medical men are familiar, but simply to indicate a few.\r\nThere is favus or scall-head, called also \"porrigo,\" which has its\r\nprimary seat in the hair follicles. Plica polonica, which is\r\nendemic in Russia, is almost cosmopolitan. Then there is Tinea\r\ntonsurans, Alopecia, Sycosis, &c., and in India a more deeply-seated\r\ndisease, the Madura Foot, has been traced to the ravages of a fungus\r\ndescribed under the name of _Chionyphe Carteri_.[G] It is probable\r\nthat the application of different names to the very often imperfect\r\nforms of fungi which are associated with different diseases is not\r\nscientifically tenable. Perhaps one or two common moulds, such as\r\n_Aspergillus_ or _Penicillium_, lie at the base of the majority, but\r\nthis is of little importance here, and does not affect the general\r\nprinciple that some skin diseases are due to fungi.\r\n\r\nWhilst admitting that there are such diseases, it must be understood\r\nthat diseases have been attributed to fungi as a primary cause, when\r\nthe evidence does not warrant such a conclusion. Diphtheria and thrush\r\nhave been referred to the devastations of fungi, whereas diphtheria\r\ncertainly may and does occur without any trace of fungi. Fevers may\r\nsometimes be accompanied by fungoid bodies in the evacuations, but it\r\nis very difficult to determine them. The whole question of epidemic\r\ndiseases being caused by the presence of fungi seems based on most\r\nincomplete evidence. Dr. Salisbury was of opinion that camp measles\r\nwas produced by _Puccinia graminis_, the pseudospores of which\r\ngerminated in the damp straw, disseminated the resultant secondary\r\nbodies in the air, and caused the disease. This has never been\r\nverified. Measles, too, has been attributed freely, as well as\r\nscarlatina,[H] to fungal influences, and the endeavours to implicate\r\nfungi in being the cause of cholera have been pertinaciously\r\npersevered in with no conviction. The presence of certain cysts, said\r\nto be those of _Urocystis_, derived from rice, was announced by Dr.\r\nHallier, but when it was shown that no such fungus was found on rice,\r\nthis phase of the theory collapsed. Special and competent experts were\r\nsent from this country to examine the preparations and hear the\r\nexplanations of Dr. Hallier on his theory of cholera contagion, but\r\nthey were neither convinced nor satisfied.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1853, Dr. Lauder Lindsay examined and reported on\r\ncholera evacuations, and in 1856 he declared--\"It will be evident that\r\nI can see no satisfactory groundwork for the fungus theory of cholera,\r\nwhich I am not a little surprised to find still possesses powerful\r\nadvocates.\"[I] And of the examinations undertaken by him he\r\nwrites:--\"The mycelium and sporules of various species of fungi,\r\nconstituting various forms of vegetable mould, were found in the scum\r\nof the vomit, as well as of the stools, but only at some stage of\r\ndecomposition. They are found, however, under similar circumstances,\r\nin the vomit and stools of other diseases, and, indeed, in all\r\ndecomposing animal fluids, and they are therefore far from peculiar to\r\ncholera.\"\r\n\r\nSome writers have held that the atmosphere is often highly charged\r\nwith fungi spores, others have denied the presence of organic bodies\r\nto any extent in the air. The experiments conducted in India by Dr.\r\nCunningham[J] have been convincing enough on this point. This report\r\nstates that spores and similar cells were of constant occurrence, and\r\nwere generally present in considerable numbers. That the majority of\r\nthe cells were living and ready to undergo development on meeting with\r\nsuitable conditions was very manifest, as in those cases in which\r\npreparations were retained under observation for any length of time,\r\ngermination rapidly took place in many of the cells; indeed, many\r\nspores already germinating were deposited on the slides. In few\r\ninstances did any development take place beyond the formation of\r\nmycelium or masses of toruloid cells, but in one or two distinct\r\nsporules were developed on the filaments arising from some of the\r\nlarger septate spores, and in a few others _Penicillium_ and\r\n_Aspergillus_ produced their characteristic heads of fructification.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the precise nature of the spores and other cells\r\npresent in various instances little can be said, as, unless their\r\ndevelopment were to be carefully followed out through all its stages,\r\nit is impossible to refer them to their correct species or even\r\ngenera. The greater number of them are apparently referable to the old\r\norders of fungi--_Sphæronemei_, _Melanconei_, _Torulacei_, _Dematiei_,\r\nand _Mucedines_, while some probably belonged to the _Pucciniei_ and\r\n_Coæmacei_. Amongst those belonging to the _Torulacei_, the most\r\ninteresting was a representative of the rare genus _Tetraploa_.\r\nDistinct green algoid cells occurred in some specimens. Then follow in\r\nthe report details of observations made on the rise and fall of\r\ndiseases, of which diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, ague, and dengue\r\nwere selected and compared with the increase or diminution of\r\natmospheric cells. The conclusions arrived at are:--\r\n\r\n\"Spores and other vegetable cells are constantly present in\r\natmospheric dust, and usually occur in considerable numbers; the\r\nmajority of them are living, and capable of growth and development.\r\nThe amount of them present in the air appears to be independent of\r\nconditions of velocity and direction of the wind, and their number is\r\nnot diminished by moisture.\r\n\r\n\"No connection can be traced between the numbers of bacteria, spores,\r\n&c., present in the air, and the occurrence of diarrhoea, dysentery,\r\ncholera, ague, or dengue, nor between the presence or abundance of any\r\nspecial form or forms of cells, and the prevalence of any of these\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of inorganic and amorphous particles and other débris\r\nsuspended in the atmosphere is directly dependent on conditions of\r\nmoisture and velocity of wind.\"\r\n\r\nThis report is accompanied by fourteen large and well-executed plates,\r\neach containing hundreds of figures of organic bodies collected from\r\nthe air between February and September. It is valuable both for its\r\nevidence as to the number and character of the spores in the air, and\r\nalso for the tables showing the relation between five forms of\r\ndisease, and their fluctuations, as compared with the amount of spores\r\nfloating in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe are fain to believe that we have represented the influence of fungi\r\non man as far as evidence seems to warrant. The presence of forms of\r\nmould in some of their incipient conditions in different diseased\r\nparts of the human body, externally and internally, may be admitted\r\nwithout the assumption that they are in any manner the cause of the\r\ndiseased tissues, except in such cases as we have indicated. Hospital\r\ngangrene may be alluded to in this connection, and it is possible that\r\nit may be due to some fungus allied to the crimson spots (blood rain)\r\nwhich occur on decayed vegetation and meat in an incipient stage of\r\ndecomposition. This fungus was at one time regarded as an algal, at\r\nanother as animal; but it is much more probable that it is a low\r\ncondition of some common mould. The readiness with which the spores of\r\nfungi floating in the atmosphere adhere to and establish themselves on\r\nall putrid or corrupt substances is manifest in the experience of all\r\nwho have had to do with the dressing of wounds, and in this case it is\r\na matter of the greatest importance that, as much as possible,\r\natmospherical contact should be avoided.\r\n\r\nRecently a case occurred at the Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh which was\r\nsomewhat novel. The assistant to the botanical professor was preparing\r\nfor demonstration some dried specimens of a large puff-ball, filled\r\nwith the dust-like spores, which he accidentally inhaled, and was for\r\nsome time confined to his room under medical attendance from the\r\nirritation they caused. This would seem to prove that the spores of\r\nsome fungi are liable, when inhaled in large quantities, to derange\r\nthe system and become dangerous; but under usual and natural\r\nconditions such spores are not likely to be present in the atmosphere\r\nin sufficient quantity to cause inconvenience. In the autumn a very\r\nlarge number of basidiospores must be present in the atmosphere of\r\nwoods, and yet there is no reason to believe that it is more unhealthy\r\nto breathe the atmosphere of a wood in September or October than in\r\nJanuary or May. Dreadful effects are said to be produced by a species\r\nof black rust which attacks the large South of Europe reed, _Arundo\r\ndonax_. This is in all probability the same species with that which\r\nattacks _Arundo phragmitis_ in this country, the spores of which\r\nproduce violent headaches and other disorders amongst the labourers\r\nwho cut the reeds for thatching. M. Michel states that the spores from\r\nthe parasite on _Arundo donax_, either inhaled or injected, produce\r\nviolent papular eruption on the face, attended with great swelling,\r\nand a variety of alarming symptoms which it is unnecessary to\r\nparticularize, in various parts of the body.[K] Perhaps if _Sarcina_\r\nshould ultimately prove to be a fungus, it may be added to the list of\r\nthose which aggravate, if they are not the primary cause of, disease\r\nin the human subject.\r\n\r\nII. What influences can be attributed to fungi upon animals other than\r\nman? Clearly instinct preserves animals from many dangers. It may be\r\npresumed that under ordinary circumstances there is not much fear of a\r\ncow or a sheep poisoning itself in a pasture or a wood. But under\r\nextraordinary circumstances it is not only possible, but very\r\nprobable, that injuries may occur. For instance, it is well known that\r\nnot only rye and wheat, but also many of the grasses, are liable to\r\ninfection from a peculiar form of fungus called \"ergot.\" In certain\r\nseasons this ergot is much more common than others, and the belief is\r\nstrong in those who ought to know something of the subject from\r\nexperience, viz., farmers and graziers, that in such seasons it is not\r\nuncommon for cattle to slip their young through feeding on ergotized\r\ngrass. Then, again, it is fairly open to inquiry whether, in years\r\nwhen \"red rust\" and \"mildew\" are more than usually plentiful on\r\ngrasses, these may not be to a certain extent injurious. Without\r\nattempting to associate the cattle plague in any way with fungi on\r\ngrass, it is nevertheless a most remarkable coincidence that the year\r\nin which the cattle disease was most prevalent in this country was one\r\nin which there was--at least in some districts--more \"red rust\" on\r\ngrasses than we ever remember to have seen before or since; the\r\nclothes of a person walking through the rusty field soon became\r\norange-coloured from the abundance of spores. Graziers on this point\r\nagain seem to be generally agreed, that they do not think \"red rust\"\r\nhas been proved to be injurious to cattle. The direct influence of\r\nfungi on quadrupeds, birds, reptilia, &c., seems to be infinitesimally\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nInsects of various orders have been observed from time to time to\r\nbecome the prey of fungi.[L] That known at Guadaloupe under the name\r\nof _La Guêpe Végétale_, or vegetable wasp, has been often cited as\r\nevidence that, in some instances at least, the fungus attacks the\r\ninsect whilst still living. Dr. Madianna states that he has noticed\r\nthe wasp still living with its incumbrance attached to it, though\r\napparently in the last stage of existence, and seeming about to perish\r\nfrom the influence of its destructive parasite.[M] This fungus is\r\ncalled by Tulasne _Torrubia sphecocephala_.[N] About twenty-five\r\nspecies of this genus of sphæriaceous fungi have been described as\r\nparasitic on insects. Five species are recorded in South Carolina, one\r\nin Pennsylvania, found on the larvæ of the May-bug, and one other\r\nNorth American species on Nocturnal Lepidoptera, one in Cayenne, one\r\nin Brazil, on the larva of a _Cicada_, and one on a species of ant,\r\ntwo in the West Indies, one in New Guinea on a species of _Coccus_,\r\nand one on a species of _Vespa_ in Senegal. In Australia two species\r\nhave been recorded, and two are natives of New Zealand. Dr. Hooker\r\nfound two in the Khassya mountains of India, and one American species\r\nhas also been found at Darjeeling. It has long been known that one\r\nspecies, which has a medicinal repute there, is found in China, whilst\r\nthree have been recorded in Great Britain. Opinions are divided as to\r\nwhether in these instances the fungus causes or is subsequent to the\r\ndeath of the insect. It is generally the belief of entomologists that\r\nthe death of the insect is caused by the fungus. In the case of\r\n_Isaria sphingum_, which is the conidia form of a species of\r\n_Torrubia_, the moth has been found standing on a leaf, as during\r\nlife, with the fungus sprouting from its body.\r\n\r\nOther and less perfect forms of fungi also attack insects. During the\r\nsummer of 1826, Professor Sebert collected a great many caterpillars\r\nof _Arctia villica_, for the purpose of watching their growth. These\r\ninsects on arriving at their full size became quite soft, and then\r\nsuddenly died. Soon after they became hard, and, if bent, would easily\r\nbreak into two pieces. Their bodies were covered with a beautiful\r\nshining white mould. If some of the caterpillars affected with the\r\nparasitic mould were placed on the same tree with those apparently\r\nfree from its attack, the latter soon exhibited signs that they also\r\nwere attacked in the same manner, in consequence of coming into\r\ncontact with each other.[O]\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1851, some twelve or twenty specimens were found\r\nfrom amongst myriads of _Cicada septemdecim_, which, though living,\r\nhad the posterior third of the abdominal contents converted into a\r\ndry, powdery, ochreous-yellow compact mass of sporuloid bodies. The\r\nouter coverings of that portion of the insect were loose and easily\r\ndetached, leaving the fungoid matter in the form of a cone affixed by\r\nits base to the unaffected part of the abdomen of the insect. The\r\nfungus may commence, says Dr. Leidy, its attacks upon the larva,\r\ndevelop its mycelium, and produce a sporular mass within the active\r\npupa, when many are probably destroyed; but should some be only\r\naffected so far as not to destroy the organs immediately essential to\r\nlife, they might undergo their metamorphosis into the imago, in which\r\ncase they would be affected in the manner previously described.[P]\r\n\r\nThe common house-fly in autumn is very usually subject to the attacks\r\nof a mouldy fungus called _Sporendonema muscæ_, or _Empusa muscæ_ in\r\nformer times, which is now regarded as the terrestrial condition of\r\none of the _Saprolegniei_.[Q] The flies become sluggish, and at last\r\nfix themselves to some object on which they die, with their legs\r\nextended and head depressed, the body and wings soon becoming covered\r\nwith a minute white mould, the joints of which fall on the surrounding\r\nobject. Examples are readily distinguished when they settle on windows\r\nand thus succumb to their foe. Mr. Gray says that a similar mould has\r\nbeen observed on individuals of the wasp family.\r\n\r\nA _Gryllotalpa_ was found in a wood near Newark, Delaware, U. S., upon\r\nturning over a log. The insect was seen standing very quietly at the\r\nmouth of its oval cell, which is formed in the earth, having a short\r\ncurved tube to the surface. Upon taking it up it exhibited no signs of\r\nmovement, though perfectly fresh and lifelike in appearance. On\r\nexamining it next morning it still presented no signs of life. Every\r\npart of the insect was perfect, not even the antennæ being broken.\r\nUpon feeling it, it was very hard and resistant, and on making an\r\nincision through the thorax it exhaled a fungoid odour. The insect had\r\nbeen invaded by a parasitic fungus which everywhere filled the animal,\r\noccupying the position of all the soft tissue, and extending even into\r\nthe tarsal joints. It formed a yellowish or cream-coloured compact\r\nmass.[R]\r\n\r\nThe destructive silk-worm disease, _Botrytis Bassiana_, is also a\r\nfungus which attacks and destroys the living insect, concerning which\r\nan immense deal has been written, but which has not yet been\r\neradicated. It has also been supposed that a low form or imperfect\r\ncondition of a mould has much to do with the disease of bees known as\r\n\"foul brood.\"[S]\r\n\r\n_Penicillium Fieberi_, figured by Corda on a beetle, was doubtless\r\ndeveloped entirely after death, with which event it had probably\r\nnothing whatever to do.[T] Sufficient, however, has been written to\r\nshow that fungi have an influence on insect life, and this might\r\nbe extended to other animal forms, as to spiders, on which one or two\r\nspecies of _Isaria_ are developed, whilst Dr. Leidy has recorded\r\nobservations on _Julus_[U] which may be perused with advantage.\r\nFish are subject to a mouldy-looking parasite belonging to the\r\n_Saprolegniei_, and a similar form attacks the ova of toads and\r\nfrogs. Gold fish in globes and aquaria are very subject to attack\r\nfrom this mouldy enemy, and although we have seen them recover\r\nunder a constant change of water, this is by no means always the\r\ncase, for in a few weeks the parasite will usually prevail.\r\n\r\nThe influence of fungi upon animals in countries other than\r\nEuropean is very little known, except in the case of the species of\r\n_Torrubia_ found on insects, and the diseases to which silkworms are\r\nsubject. Instances have been recorded of the occurrence of fungoid\r\nmycelium--for in most it is nothing more--in the tissues of\r\nanimals, in the hard structure of bone and shell, in the intestines,\r\nlungs, and other fleshy parts, and in various organs of birds.[V] In\r\nsome of the latter cases it has been described as a Mucor, in most it\r\nis merely cells without sufficient character for determination. It is\r\nby no means improbable that fungi may be found in such situations;\r\nthe only question with regard to them is whether they are not\r\naccidental, and not the producers of unhealthy or diseased tissues,\r\neven when found in proximity thereto.\r\n\r\nThere is one phase of the influences of fungi on the lower animals\r\nwhich must not be wholly passed over, and that is the relation which\r\nthey bear to some of the insect tribes in furnishing them with food.\r\nIt is especially the case with the _Coleoptera_ that many species seem\r\nto be entirely dependent on fungi for existence, since they are found\r\nin no other situations. Beetle-hunters tell us that old _Polyporei_,\r\nand similar fungi of a corky or woody nature, are always sought after\r\nfor certain species which they seek in vain elsewhere,[W] and those\r\nwho possess herbaria know how destructive certain minute members of\r\nthe animal kingdom are to their choicest specimens, against whose\r\ndepredations even poison is sometimes unavailing.\r\n\r\nSome of the Uredines, as _Trichobasis suaveolens_ and _Coleosporium\r\nsonchi_, are generally accompanied by a little orange larva which\r\npreys upon the fungus; and in the United States Dr. Bolles informs us\r\nthat some species of _Æcidium_ are so constantly infested with this\r\nred larva that it is scarcely possible to get a good specimen, or to\r\nkeep it from its sworn enemy. Minute _Anguillidæ_ revel in tufts of\r\nmould, and fleshy Agarics, as they pass into decay, become colonies of\r\ninsect life. Small _Lepidoptera_, belonging to the _Tineina_, appear\r\nto have a liking for such _Polyporei_ as _P. sulfureus_ when it\r\nbecomes dry and hard, or _P. squamosus_ when it has attained a similar\r\ncondition. _Acari_ and _Psocidæ_ attack dried fungi of all kinds, and\r\nspeedily reduce them to an unrecognizable powder.\r\n\r\nIII. What are the influences exerted by fungi on other plants? This is\r\na broad subject, but withal an important one, since these influences\r\nact indirectly on man as well as on the lower animals. On man,\r\ninasmuch as it interferes with the vegetable portion of his food,\r\neither by checking its production or depreciating its quality. On the\r\nlower animals, since by this means not only is their natural food\r\ndeteriorated or diminished, but through it injurious effects are\r\nliable to be produced by the introduction of minute fungi into the\r\nsystem. These remarks apply mainly to fungi which are parasitic on\r\nliving plants. On the other hand, the influence of fungi must not be\r\nlost sight of as the scavengers of nature when dealing with dead and\r\ndecaying vegetable matter. Therefore, as in other instances, we have\r\nhere also good and bad influences intermingled, so that it cannot be\r\nsaid that they are wholly evil, or unmixed good.\r\n\r\nWherever we encounter decaying vegetable matter we meet with\r\nfungi, living upon and at the expense of decay, appropriating the\r\nchanged elements of previous vegetable life to the support of a new\r\ngeneration, and hastening disintegration and assimilation with the\r\nsoil. No one can have observed the mycelium of fungi at work on old\r\nstumps, twigs, and decayed wood, without being struck with the\r\nrapidity and certainty with which disintegration is being carried on.\r\nThe gardener casts on one side, in a pile as rubbish, twigs and\r\ncuttings from his trees, which are useless to him, but which have\r\nall derived much from the soil on which they flourished. Shortly\r\nfungi make their appearance in species almost innumerable, sending\r\ntheir subtle threads of mycelium deep into the tissues of the\r\nwoody substance, and the whole mass teems with new life. In this\r\nmetamorphosis as the fungi flourish so the twigs decay, for the new\r\nlife is supported at the expense of the old, and together the\r\ndestroyers and their victims return as useful constituents to the\r\nsoil from whence they were derived, and form fresh pabulum for a\r\nsucceeding season of green leaves and sweet flowers. In woods and\r\nforests we can even more readily appreciate the good offices of\r\nfungi in accelerating the decay of fallen leaves and twigs which\r\nsurround the base of the parent trees. In such places Nature is left\r\nabsolutely to her own resources, and what man would accomplish in\r\nhis carefully attended gardens and shrubberies must here be done\r\nwithout his aid. What we call decay is merely change; change of\r\nform, change of relationship, change of composition; and all these\r\nchanges are effected by various combined agencies--water, air,\r\nlight, heat, these furnishing new and suitable conditions for the\r\ndevelopment of a new race of vegetables. These, by their vigorous\r\ngrowth, continue what water and oxygen, stimulated by light and\r\nheat, had begun, and as they flourish for a brief season on the fallen\r\nglories of the past summer, make preparation for the coming spring.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this destructive power of fungi over vegetable tissues\r\nis too often exemplified in a manner which man does not approve. The\r\ndry rot is a name which has been given to the ravages of more than one\r\nspecies of fungus which flourishes at the expense of the timber it\r\ndestroys. One of these forms of dry rot fungus is _Merulius\r\nlacrymans_, which is sometimes spoken of as if it were the only one,\r\nthough perhaps the most destructive in houses. Another is _Polyporus\r\nhybridus_, which attacks oak-built vessels;[X] and these are not the\r\nonly ones which are capable of mischief. It appears that the dry rot\r\nfungus acts indirectly on the wood, whose cells are saturated with its\r\njuice, and in consequence lose their lignine and cellulose, though\r\ntheir walls suffer no corrosion. The different forms of decay in wood\r\nare accompanied by fungi, which either completely destroy the tissue,\r\nor alter its nature so much by the abstraction of the cellulose and\r\nlignine, that it becomes loose and friable. Thus fungi induce the\r\nrapid destruction of decaying wood. These are the conclusions\r\ndetermined by Schacht, in his memoir on the subject.[Y]\r\n\r\nWe may allude, in passing, to another phase of destructiveness in the\r\nmycelium of fungi, which traverse the soil and interfere most\r\ninjuriously with the growth of shrubs and trees. The reader of\r\njournals devoted to horticulture will not fail to notice the constant\r\nappeals for advice to stop the work of fungi in the soil, which\r\nsometimes threatens vines, at others conifers, and at others\r\nrhododendrons. Dead leaves, and other vegetable substances, not\r\nthoroughly and completely decayed, are almost sure to introduce this\r\nunwelcome element.\r\n\r\nLiving plants suffer considerably from the predations of parasitic\r\nspecies, and foremost amongst these in importance are those which\r\nattack the cereals. The corn mildew and its accompanying rust are\r\ncosmopolitan, as far as we know, wherever corn is cultivated, whether\r\nin Australia or on the slopes of the Himalayas. The same may also be\r\nsaid of smut, for _Ustilago_ is as common in Asia and America as in\r\nEurope. We have seen it on numerous grasses as well as on barley from\r\nthe Punjab, and a species different from _Ustilago maydis_ on the male\r\nflorets of maize from the same locality. In addition to this, we learn\r\nthat in 1870 one form made its appearance on rice. It was described as\r\nconstituting in some of the infested grains a whitish, gummy,\r\ninterlaced, ill-defined, thread-like mycelium, growing at the expense\r\nof the tissues of the affected organs, and at last becoming converted\r\ninto a more or less coherent mass of spores, of a dirty green colour,\r\non the exterior of the deformed grains. Beneath the outer coating the\r\naggregated spores are of a bright orange red; the central portion has\r\na vesicular appearance, and is white in colour.[Z] It is difficult to\r\ndetermine from the description what this so-called _Ustilago_ may be,\r\nwhich was said to have affected a considerable portion of the standing\r\nrice crop in the vicinity of Diamond Harbour.\r\n\r\nBunt is another pest (_Tilletia caries_) which occupies the whole\r\nfarinaceous portion of the grains of wheat. Since dressing the seed\r\nwheat has been so widely adopted in this country, this pest has been\r\nof comparatively little trouble. Sorghum and the small millets, in\r\ncountries where these are cultivated for food, are liable to attacks\r\nfrom allied parasites. Ergot attacks wheat and rice as well as rye,\r\nbut not to such an extent as to have any important influence upon the\r\ncrop. Two or three other species of fungi are sometimes locally\r\ntroublesome, as _Dilophospora graminis_, and _Septoria nodorum_ on\r\nwheat, but not to any considerable extent. In countries where maize is\r\nextensively grown it has not only its own species of mildew\r\n(_Puccinia_), but also one of the most enormous and destructive\r\nspecies of _Ustilago_.\r\n\r\nA singular parasite on grasses was found by Cesati in Italy, in 1850,\r\ninfesting the glumes of _Andropogon_.[a] It received the name of\r\n_Cerebella Andropogonis_, but it never appears to have increased and\r\nspread to such an extent as was at first feared.\r\n\r\nEven more destructive than any of these is the potato disease[b]\r\n(_Peronospora infestans_), which is, unfortunately, too well known to\r\nneed description. This disease was at one time attributed to various\r\ncauses, but long since its ascertained source has been acknowledged to\r\nbe a species of white mould, which also attacks tomatoes, but less\r\nvigorously. De Bary has given considerable attention to this disease,\r\nand his opinions are clearly detailed in his memoir on _Peronospora_,\r\nas well as in his special pamphlet on the potato disease.[c] One sees\r\nthe cause of the epidemic, he says, in the diseased state of the\r\npotato itself, produced either accidentally by unfavourable conditions\r\nof soil and atmosphere, or by a depravation that the plant has\r\nexperienced in its culture. According to these opinions, the\r\nvegetation of the parasite would be purely accidental, the disease\r\nwould be independent of it, the parasite would be able frequently even\r\nto spare the diseased organs. Others see in the vegetation of the\r\n_Peronospora_ the immediate or indirect cause of the various symptoms\r\nof the disease; either that the parasite invades the stalks of the\r\npotato, and in destroying them, or, so to speak, in poisoning them,\r\ndetermines a diseased state of the tubercles, or that it introduces\r\nitself into all the organs of the plant, and that its vegetation is\r\nthe immediate cause of all the symptoms of the disease that one meets\r\nwith in any organ whatever. His observations rigorously proved that\r\nthe opinions of the latter were those only which were well founded.\r\nAll the alterations seen on examining spontaneous individuals are\r\nfound when the _Peronospora_ is sown in a nourishing plant. The most\r\nscrupulous examination demonstrates the most perfect identity between\r\nthe cultivated and spontaneous individuals as much in the organization\r\nof the parasite as in the alteration of the plant that nourishes it.\r\nIn the experiments that he had made he affirms that he never observed\r\nan individual or unhealthy predisposition of the nourishing plant. It\r\nappeared to him, on the contrary, that the more the plant was healthy,\r\nthe more the mould prospered.\r\n\r\nWe cannot follow him through all the details of the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the disease, or of his experiments on this and allied\r\nspecies, which resulted in the affirmation that the mould immediately\r\ndetermines the disease of the tubercles as well as that of the leaves,\r\nand that the vegetation of the _Peronospora_ alone determines the\r\nredoubtable epidemic to which the potato is exposed.[d] We believe\r\nthat this same observer is still engaged in a series of observations,\r\nwith the view, if possible, of suggesting some remedy or mitigation of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nDr. Hassall pointed out, many years since, the action of fungous\r\nmycelium, when coming in contact with cellular tissue, of inducing\r\ndecomposition, a fact which has been fully confirmed by Berkeley.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are other species of the same genus of moulds which\r\nare very destructive to garden produce. _Peronospora gangliformis_, B.,\r\nattacks lettuces, and is but too common and injurious. _Peronospora\r\neffusa_, Grev., is found on spinach and allied plants. _Peronospora\r\nSchleideniana_, D. By., is in some years very common and destructive\r\nto young onions, and field crops of lucerne are very liable to attack\r\nfrom _Peronospora trifoliorum_, D. By.\r\n\r\nThe vine crops are liable to be seriously affected by a species of\r\nmould, which is but the conidia form of a species of _Erysiphe_. This\r\nmould, known under the name of _Oidium Tuckeri_, B., attacks the vines\r\nin hothouses in this country, but on the Continent the vineyards often\r\nsuffer severely[e] from its depredations; unfortunately, not the only\r\npest to which the vine is subject, for an insect threatens to be even\r\nmore destructive.\r\n\r\nHop gardens suffer severely, in some years, from a similar disease; in\r\nthis instance the mature or ultimate form is perfected. The hop mildew\r\nis _Sphærotheca Castagnei_, Lév., which first appears as whitish\r\nmouldy blotches on the leaves, soon becoming discoloured, and\r\ndeveloping the black receptacles on either surface of the leaf. These\r\nmay be regarded as the cardinal diseases of fungoid origin to which\r\nuseful plants are subject in this country.\r\n\r\nAmongst those of less importance, but still troublesome enough to\r\nsecure the anathemas of cultivators, may be mentioned _Puccinia Apii_,\r\nCa., often successful in spoiling beds of celery by attacking the\r\nleaves; _Cystopus candidus_, Lév., and _Glæosporium concentricum_,\r\nGrev., destructive to cabbages and other cruciferous plants;\r\n_Trichobasis Fabæ_, Lév., unsparing when once established on beans;\r\n_Erysiphe Martii_, Lév., in some seasons a great nuisance to the crop\r\nof peas.\r\n\r\nFruit trees do not wholly escape, for _Roestelia cancellata_, Tul.,\r\nattacks the leaves of the pear. _Puccinia prunorum_ affects the leaves\r\nof almost all the varieties of plum. Blisters caused by _Ascomyces\r\ndeformans_, B., contort the leaves of peaches, as _Ascomyces\r\nbullatus_, B., does those of the pear, and _Ascomyces juglandis_, B.,\r\nthose of the walnut. Happily we do not at present suffer from\r\n_Ascomyces pruni_, Fchl., which, on the Continent, attacks young\r\nplum-fruits, causing them to shrivel and fall. During the past year\r\npear-blossoms have suffered from what seems to be a form of\r\n_Helminthosporium pyrorum_, and the branches are sometimes infected\r\nwith _Capnodium elongatum_; but orchards in the United States have a\r\nworse foe in the \"black knot,\"[f] which causes gouty swellings in the\r\nbranches, and is caused by the _Sphæria morbosa_ of Schweinitz.\r\n\r\nCotton plants in India[g] were described by Dr. Shortt as subject to\r\nthe attacks of a kind of mildew, which from the description appeared\r\nto be a species of _Erysiphe_, but on receiving specimens from India\r\nfor examination, we found it to be one of those diseased conditions of\r\ntissue formerly classed with fungi under the name of _Erineum_; and a\r\nspecies of Torula attacks cotton pods after they are ripe. Tea leaves\r\nin plantations in Cachar have been said to suffer from some sort of\r\nblight, but in all that we have seen insects appear to be the\r\ndepredators, although on the decaying leaves _Hendersonia theicola_,\r\nCooke, establishes itself.[h] The coffee plantations of Ceylon suffer\r\nfrom the depredations of _Hemiliea vastatrix_, as well as from\r\ninsects.[i] Other useful plants have also their enemies in parasitic\r\nfungi.\r\n\r\nOlive-trees in the south of Europe suffer from the attacks of a\r\nspecies of _Antennaria_, as do also orange and lemon trees from a\r\n_Capnodium_, which covers the foliage as if with a coating of soot. In\r\nfact most useful plants appear to have some enemy to contend with, and\r\nit is fortunate, not only for the plant, but its cultivators, if this\r\nenemy is less exacting than is the case with the potato, the vine, and\r\nthe hop.\r\n\r\nForestry in Britain is an insignificant interest compared to what\r\nit is in some parts of Europe, in the United States, and in our\r\nIndian possessions. In these latter places it becomes a matter of\r\nimportance to inquire what influence fungi exert on forest trees.\r\nIt may, however, be predicated that the injury caused by fungi is far\r\noutstripped by insects, and that there are not many fungi which\r\nbecome pests in such situations. Coniferous trees may be infested\r\nwith the species of _Peridermium_, which are undoubtedly injurious,\r\n_Peridermium elatinum_, Lk., distorting and disfiguring the silver\r\nfir, as _Peridermium Thomsoni_, B.,[j] does those of _Abies\r\nSmithiana_ in the Himalayas. This species occurred at an elevation of\r\n8,000 feet. The leaves become reduced in length one-half, curved,\r\nand sprinkled, sometimes in double rows, with the large sori of\r\nthis species, which gives the tree a strange appearance, and at\r\nlength proves fatal, from the immense diversion of nutriment requisite\r\nto support a parasite so large and multitudinous. The dried specimens\r\nhave a sweet scent resembling violets. In Northern Europe _Cæoma\r\npinitorquum_, D. By., seems to be plentiful and destructive. All\r\nspecies of juniper, both in Europe and the United States, are\r\nliable to be attacked and distorted by species of _Podisoma_[k] and\r\n_Gymnosporangium_. _Antennaria pinophila_, Fr., is undoubtedly\r\ninjurious, as also are other species of _Antennaria_, which probably\r\nattain their more complete development in _Capnodium_, of which\r\n_Capnodium Citri_ is troublesome to orange-trees in the south of\r\nEurope, and other species to other trees. How far birch-trees are\r\ninjured by _Dothidea betulina_, Fr., or _Melampsora betulina_, Lév.,\r\nor poplars and aspens by _Melampsora populina_, Lév., and _Melampsora\r\ntremulæ_, Lév., we cannot say. The species of _Lecythea_ found on\r\nwillow leaves have decidedly a prejudicial effect on the growth of\r\nthe affected plant.\r\n\r\nFloriculture has to contend with many fungoid enemies, which sometimes\r\ncommit great ravages amongst the choicest flowers. Roses have to\r\ncontend against the two forms of _Phragmidium mucronatum_ as well as\r\n_Asteroma Rosæ_. Still more disastrous is a species of _Erysiphei_,\r\nwhich at first appears like a dense white mould. This is named\r\n_Sphærotheca pannosa_. Nor is this all, for _Peronospora sparsa_, when\r\nit attacks roses in conservatories, is merciless in its exactions.[l]\r\nSometimes violets will be distorted and spoiled by _Urocystis Violæ_.\r\nThe garden anemone is freely attacked by _Æcidium quadrifidum_.\r\nOrchids are liable to spot from fungi on the leaves, and recently the\r\nwhole of the choicest hollyhocks have been threatened with destruction\r\nby a merciless foe in _Puccinia malvacearum_. This fungus was first\r\nmade known to the world as an inhabitant of South America many years\r\nago. It seems next to have come into notoriety in the Australian\r\ncolonies. Then two or three years ago we hear of it for the first time\r\non the continent of Europe, and last year for the first time in any\r\nthreatening form in our own islands. During the present year its\r\nravages are spreading, until all admirers of hollyhocks begin to feel\r\nalarm lest it should entirely exterminate the hollyhock from\r\ncultivation. It is common on wild mallows, and cotton cultivators must\r\nbe on the alert, for there is a probability that other malvaceous\r\nplants may suffer.\r\n\r\nA writer in the \"Gardener's Chronicle\" has proposed a remedy for the\r\nhollyhock disease, which he hopes will prove effectual. He says, \"This\r\nterrible disease has now, for twelve months, threatened the complete\r\nannihilation of the glorious family of hollyhock, and to baffle all\r\nthe antidotes that the ingenuity of man could suggest, so rapidly does\r\nit spread and accomplish its deadly work. Of this I have had very sad\r\nevidence, as last year at this time I had charge of, if not the\r\nlargest, one of the largest and finest collections of hollyhocks\r\nanywhere in cultivation, which had been under my special care for\r\neleven years, and up to within a month of my resigning that position I\r\nhad observed nothing uncommon amongst them; but before taking my final\r\nleave of them I had to witness the melancholy spectacle of bed after\r\nbed being smitten down, and amongst them many splendid seedlings,\r\nwhich had cost me years of patience and anxiety to produce. And\r\nagain, upon taking a share and the management of this business,\r\nanother infected collection fell to my lot, so that I have been doing\r\nearnest battle with this disease since its first appearance amongst\r\nus, and I must confess that, up to a very short time back, I had come\r\nin for a great deal the worst of the fight, although I had made use of\r\nevery agent I could imagine as being likely to aid me, and all that\r\nmany competent friends could suggest. But lately I was reminded of\r\nCondy's patent fluid, diluted with water, and at once procured a\r\nbottle of the green quality, and applied it in the proportion of a\r\nlarge tablespoonful to one quart of water, and upon examining the\r\nplants dressed, twelve hours afterwards, was delighted to find it had\r\neffectually destroyed the disease (which is easily discernible, as\r\nwhen it is living and thriving it is of a light grey colour, but when\r\nkilled it becomes of a rusty black). Further to test the power at\r\nwhich the plant was capable of bearing the antidote without injury, I\r\nused it double the strength. This dose was instant death to the pest,\r\nleaving no trace of any injury to the foliage. As to its application,\r\nI advocate sponging in all dressings of this description. Syringing is\r\na very ready means, but very wasteful. No doubt sponging consumes more\r\ntime, but taking into consideration the more effectual manner in which\r\nthe dressing can be executed alone, it is in the end most economical,\r\nespecially in regard to this little parasite. I have found it\r\ndifficult by syringing, as it has great power of resisting and\r\nthrowing off moisture, and if but a very few are left living, it is\r\nastonishing how quickly it redistributes itself. I feel confident,\r\nthat by the application of this remedy in time another season, I shall\r\nkeep this collection clean. I believe planting the hollyhock in large\r\ncrowded beds should be avoided, as I have observed the closer they are\r\ngrowing the more virulently does the disease attack them, whereas\r\nisolated rows and plants are but little injured.\"[m]\r\n\r\nThe \"Gardener's Chronicle\" has also sounded a note of warning that a\r\nspecies of Uredine has been very destructive to pelargoniums at the\r\nCape of Good Hope. Hitherto these plants have not suffered much in\r\nthis country from parasites. Besides these, there are many other less\r\ntroublesome parasites, such as _Uredo filicum_, on ferns; _Puccinia\r\nLychnidearum_, on leaves of sweet-william; _Uredo Orchidis_, on leaves\r\nof orchids, &c.\r\n\r\nIf we would sum up the influences of fungi in a few words, it could be\r\ndone somewhat in the following form.\r\n\r\nFungi exert a deleterious influence--\r\n\r\n      On _Man_,\r\n\r\n        When eaten inadvertently.\r\n        By the destruction of his legitimate food.\r\n        In producing or aggravating skin diseases.\r\n\r\n      On _Animals_,\r\n\r\n        By deteriorating or diminishing their food supplies.\r\n        By establishing themselves as parasites on some species.\r\n\r\n      On _Plants_,\r\n\r\n        By hastening the decay of timber.\r\n        By establishing themselves as parasites.\r\n        By impregnating the soil.\r\n\r\nBut it is not proved that they produce epidemic diseases in man or\r\nanimals, or that the dissemination of their multitudinous spores in\r\nthe atmosphere has any appreciable influence on the health of the\r\nhuman race. Hence their association with cholera, diarrhoea, measles,\r\nscarlatina, and the manifold ills that flesh is heir to, as producing\r\nor aggravating causes, must, in the present state of our knowledge and\r\nexperience, be deemed apocryphal.\r\n\r\n   [A] A detailed account of the peculiar properties of this fungus and\r\n       its employment as a narcotic will be found in Cooke's \"Seven\r\n       Sisters of Sleep,\" p. 337. It is figured in Greville's\r\n       \"Scottish Cryptogamic Flora,\" plate 54.\r\n\r\n   [B] Pour chaque 500 grammes de champignons coupes en morceaux\r\n       d'assez mediocre grandeur, il faut un litre d'eau acidulée par\r\n       deux ou trois cuillerées de vinaigre, ou deux cuillerées de sel\r\n       gris.

The\r\ninexperienced, indeed, require some guide, or much labour will be\r\nexpended and patience lost in seeking microscopic forms in just such\r\nplaces as they are least likely to inhabit. Nor is it wholly\r\nunprofitable or uninteresting for others, who do not claim to be\r\nstudents, to summarize the habitats of these organisms, and learn how\r\nmuch the circumstances of their immediate surrounding elements\r\ninfluence production. For reasons which will at once be recognized by\r\nthe mycologist, the most satisfactory method of study will be somewhat\r\nthat of the natural groups into which fungi are divided.\r\n\r\nAGARICINI.--There is such a close affinity between all the genera of\r\nthis group that it will be a manifest advantage to take together all\r\nthose fleshy pileate fungi, the fruit of which is borne on folded\r\nplates or gills. It must be premised of this group that, for the\r\nmajority, shade, a moderate amount of moisture, and steady warmth, but\r\nnot too great heat, are required. A stroll through a wood in autumn\r\nwill afford good evidence of the predilection of _Agaricini_, as well\r\nas some smaller groups, for such spots. A larger proportion will be\r\nfound in woods, where shade is afforded, than on open heaths or\r\npastures. These wood-loving forms will consist, again, of those which\r\nappear on the soil, and those which are found on rotten stumps and\r\ndecaying trees. Many of those which grow on trees have a lateral\r\nstem, or scarcely any stem at all. It may be remarked, that some\r\nspecies which spring from the soil delight most in the shelter of\r\nparticular trees. The Agarics of a beech wood will materially differ\r\nlargely from those in an oak wood, and both will differ from those\r\nwhich spring up beneath coniferous trees.\r\n\r\nIt may be accepted as true of the largest proportion of terrestrial\r\nspecies, that if they do not spring directly from rotten leaves, and\r\nvegetable débris in the last stage of decay, the soil will be rich in\r\nvegetable humus. A few only occur on sandy spots. The genus\r\n_Marasmius_ is much addicted to dead leaves; _Russula_, to open\r\nplaces in woods, springing immediately from the soil. _Lactarius_\r\nprefers trees, and when found in exposed situations, occurs mostly\r\nunder the shadow of trees.[A] _Cantharellus_, again, is a woodland\r\ngenus, many of the species loving to grow amongst grass or moss,\r\nand some as parasites on the latter. _Coprinus_ is not a genus much\r\naddicted to woods, but is rather peculiar in its attachment to\r\nman--if such expression, or one even implying domesticity, might\r\nbe employed--farmyards, gardens, dunghills, the base of old gateposts\r\nand railings, in cellars, on plaster walls, and even on old damp\r\ncarpets. _Hygrophorus_ loves \"the open,\" whether pastures, lawns,\r\nheaths, commons, or up the slopes of mountains, nearly to the top of\r\nthe highest found in Great Britain. _Cortinarius_ seems to have a\r\npreference for woods, whilst _Bolbitius_ affects dung, or a rich\r\nsoil. _Lentinus_, _Panus_, _Lenzites_, and _Schizophyllum_ all grow on\r\nwood. Coming to the subgenera of _Agaricus_, we find _Pleurotus_,\r\n_Crepidotus_, _Pluteus_, _Collybia_, _Pholiota_, _Flammula_,\r\n_Hypholoma_, and some species of _Psathyra_ growing on wood, old\r\nstumps, or charcoal; _Amanita_, _Tricholoma_, and _Hebeloma_ most\r\nattached to woods; _Clitocybe_ and _Mycena_ chiefly amongst leaves;\r\n_Nolanea_ amongst grass; _Omphalia_ and _Galera_ chiefly in swampy\r\nplaces; _Lepiota_, _Leptonia_, _Psalliota_, _Stropharia_, _Psilocybe_,\r\nand _Psathyrella_ mostly in open places and pastures; _Deconica_\r\nand _Panæolus_ mostly on dung; _Entoloma_ and _Clitopilus_ chiefly\r\nterrestrial, and the rest variable.\r\n\r\nOf special habitats, we may allude to _Nyctalis_, of which the species\r\nare parasitic on dead fungi belonging to the genus _Russula_. One or\r\ntwo species of _Agaricus_, such as _Agaricus tuberosus_ and _Agaricus\r\nracemosus_, P., grow on decaying Agarics, whilst _Agaricus Loveianus_\r\nflourishes on _Agaricus nebularis_ even before it is thoroughly\r\ndecayed. A few species grow on dead fir cones, others on old ferns,\r\n&c. _Agaricus cepoestipes_, Sow., probably of exotic origin, grows on\r\nold tan in hothouses. _Agaricus caulicinalis_, Bull, flourishes on old\r\nthatch, as well as twigs, &c. _Agaricus juncicola_, Fr., affects dead\r\nrushes in boggy places, whilst _Agaricus affricatus_, Fr., and\r\n_Agaricus sphagnicola_, B., are attached to bog moss in similar\r\nlocalities. Some few species are almost confined to the stems of\r\nherbaceous plants. _Agaricus petasatus_, Fr., _Agaricus cucumis_, P.,\r\nand _Paxillus panuoides_, F., have a preference for sawdust. _Agaricus\r\ncarpophilus_, Fr., and _Agaricus balaninus_, P., have a predilection\r\nfor beech mast. _Agaricus urticoecola_, B. and Br., seems to confine\r\nitself to nettle roots. _Coprinus radians_, Fr., makes its appearance\r\non plaster walls, _Coprinus domesticus_, Fr., on damp carpets. The\r\nonly epizoic species, according to M. Fries, is _Agaricus cerussatus\r\nv. nauseosus_, which has been met with in Russia on the carcase of a\r\nwolf; this, however, might have been accidental. Persoon described\r\n_Agaricus Neapolitanus_, which was found growing on coffee-grounds at\r\nNaples; and more recently Viviani has described another species,\r\n_Agaricus Coffeæ_, with rose-coloured spores, found on old fermenting\r\ncoffee-grounds at Genoa.[B] Tratinnick figures a species named\r\n_Agaricus Markii_, which was found in wine casks in Austria. A\r\n_Coprinus_ has, both in this country and on the Continent, been found,\r\nafter a very short time, on the dressing of wounds, where there has\r\nbeen no neglect. A curious case of this kind, which at the time\r\nexcited great interest, occurred some fifty years since at St.\r\nGeorge's Hospital. Some species appear to confine themselves to\r\nparticular trees, some to come up by preference on soil in garden\r\npots. Certain species have a solitary, others a gregarious habit, and,\r\nof the latter, _Agaricus grammopodius_, Bull, _Agaricus gambosus_,\r\nFr., _Marasmius oreades_, Fr., and some others grow in rings. Hence it\r\nwill be seen that, within certain limits, there is considerable\r\nvariation in the habitats of the _Agaricini_.\r\n\r\n_Boleti_ do not differ much from _Agaricini_ in their localization.\r\nThey seem to prefer woods or borders of woods to pastures, seldom\r\nbeing found in the latter. One species, _B. parasiticus_, Bull, grows\r\non old specimens of _Scleroderma_, otherwise they are for the most\r\npart terrestrial.\r\n\r\n_Polypori_ also have no wide range of habitat, except in choice of\r\ntrees on which to grow, for the majority of them are corticolous. The\r\nsection _Mesopus_, which has a distinct central stem, has some species\r\nwhich prefer the ground. _Polyporus tuberaster_, P., in Italy springs\r\nfrom the _Pietra funghaia_,[C] and is cultivated for food as well as\r\n_Polyporus avellanus_, which is reared from charred blocks of cob-nut\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nIn other genera of the _Polyporei_ similar habitats prevail. _Merulius\r\nlacrymans_, Fr., one form of dry rot, occurs in cellars, and too often\r\non worked timber; whilst _Merulius himantoides_, Fr., is much more\r\ndelicate, sometimes running over plants in conservatories.\r\n\r\nHYDNEI.--There is nothing calling for special note on the habitats of\r\nthese fungi. The stipitate species of _Hydnum_ are some of them found\r\nin woods, others on heaths, one on fir-cones, while the rest have\r\nsimilar habitats to the species of _Polyporus_.\r\n\r\nAURICULARINI.--The genera _Hymenochoete_, _Stereum_, and _Corticium_,\r\nwith some species of _Thelephora_, run over corticated or decorticated\r\nwood; other species of _Thelephora_ grow on the ground. The Pezizoid\r\nforms of _Cyphella_ and _Solenia_, like species of _Peziza_, sometimes\r\noccur on bark, and of the former genus some on grasses and others on\r\nmoss.\r\n\r\nCLAVARIEI.--The interesting, often brightly-coloured, tufts of\r\n_Clavaria_ are usually found amongst grass, growing directly from the\r\nground. Only in rare instances do they occur on dead leaves or\r\nherbaceous stems. _Calocera_ probably should be classed with the\r\n_Tremellini_, to which its structure seems more closely allied. The\r\nspecies are developed on wood. The species of _Typhula_ and\r\n_Pistillaria_ are small, growing chiefly on dead herbaceous plants.\r\nOne or two are developed from a kind of _Sclerotium_, which is in fact\r\na compact perennial mycelium.\r\n\r\nTREMELLINI.--These curious gelatinous fungi are, with rare exceptions,\r\ndeveloped on branches or naked wood; _Tremella versicolor_, B. and\r\nBr., one of the exceptions, being parasitic on a species of\r\n_Corticium_, and _Tremella epigæa_, B. and Br., spreading over the\r\nnaked soil. This completes our rapid survey of the habitats of the\r\n_Hymenomycetes_. Very few of them are really destructive to\r\nvegetation, for the Agarics and Polypori found on growing trees are\r\nseldom to be seen on vigorous, but rather on dead branches or\r\npartly-decayed trunks.\r\n\r\nThe GASTEROMYCETES are far less numerous in species, and also in\r\nindividuals, but their habitats are probably more variable. The\r\n_Hypogæi_, or subterranean species, are found either near the surface\r\nor buried in the soil, usually in the neighbourhood of trees.\r\n\r\nPHALLOIDEI.--In most cases the species prefer woody places. They are\r\nmostly terrestrial, and have the faculty of making their presence\r\nknown, even when not seen, by the fetid odour which many of them\r\nexhale. Some of them occur in sandy spots.\r\n\r\nPODAXINEI.--These resemble in their localities the _Trichogastres_.\r\nSpecies of _Podaxon_ affect the nests of Termites in tropical\r\ncountries.[D] Others are found growing amongst grass.\r\n\r\nTRICHOGASTRES.--These are chiefly terrestrial. The rare but curious\r\n_Batarrea phalloides_, P., has been found on sand-hills, and in\r\nhollow trees. _Tulostoma mammosum_, Fr., occurs on old stone walls,\r\ngrowing amongst moss. _Geaster striatus_, D. C., was at one time\r\nusually found on the sand of the Denes at Great Yarmouth. Although\r\n_Lycoperdon giganteum_, Batsch, occurs most frequently in pastures, or\r\non hedge banks in fields, we have known it to occur annually for\r\nsome consecutive years in a garden near London. The species of\r\n_Scleroderma_ seem to prefer a sandy soil. _Agloeocystis_ is rather\r\nan anomalous genus, occurring on the fruit heads of _Cyperus_, in\r\nIndia. _Broomeia_ occurs at the Cape on rotten wood.\r\n\r\nMYXOGASTRES.--Rotten wood is one of the most favoured of matrices on\r\nwhich these fungi develop themselves; some of them, however, are\r\nterrestrial. _Æthalium_ will grow on spent tan and other substances.\r\nSpecies of _Diderma_ flourish on mosses, jungermanniæ, grass, dead\r\nleaves, ferns, &c. _Angioridium sinuosum_, Grev., will run over\r\ngrowing plants of different kinds, and _Spumaria_, in like manner,\r\nencrusts living grasses. _Badhamia_ not only flourishes on dead wood,\r\nbut one species is found on the fading leaves of coltsfoot which are\r\nstill green. _Craterium_ runs over almost any substance which lies in\r\nits way. _Licea perreptans_ was found in a cucumber frame heated with\r\nspent hops. One or two _Myxogastres_ have been found on lead, or even\r\non iron which had been recently heated. Sowerby found one on cinders,\r\nin one of the galleries of St. Paul's Cathedral.\r\n\r\nNIDULARIACEI grow on the ground, or on sticks, twigs, chips, and other\r\nvegetable substances, such as sawdust, dung, and rotten wood.\r\n\r\nThe CONIOMYCETES consist of two sections, which are based on their\r\nhabitats. In one section the species are developed on dead or dying\r\nplants, in the other they are parasitic on living plants. The former\r\nincludes the _Sphæronemei_, which are variable in their proclivities,\r\nalthough mostly preferring dead herbaceous plants and the twigs of\r\ntrees. The exceptions are in favour of _Sphæronema_, some of which are\r\ndeveloped upon decaying fungi. In the large genera, _Septoria_,\r\n_Ascochyta_, _Phyllosticta_, _Asteroma_, &c., the favourite habitat is\r\nfading and dying leaves of plants of all kinds. In the majority of\r\ncases these fungi are not autonomous, but are merely the stylosporous\r\nconditions of _Sphæria_. They are mostly minute, and the stylospores\r\nare of the simplest kind. The _Melanconiei_ have a preference for the\r\ntwigs of trees, bursting through the bark, and expelling the spores in\r\na gelatinous mass. A few of them are foliicolous, but the exceptions\r\nare comparatively rare, and are represented chiefly in _Gloeosporium_,\r\nspecies of which are found also on apples, peaches, nectarines, and\r\nother fruits. The _Torulacei_ are superficial, having much of the\r\nexternal appearance of the black moulds, and like them are found on\r\ndecaying vegetable substances, old stems of herbaceous plants, dead\r\ntwigs, wood, stumps of trees, &c. The exceptions are in favour of such\r\nspecies as _Torula sporendonema_, which is the red mould of cheese,\r\nand also occurs on rats' dung, old glue, &c., and _Sporendonema\r\nMuscæ_, which is only the conidia of a species of _Achlya_. One\r\nspecies of _Bactridium_ is parasitic on the hymenium of _Peziza_, and\r\n_Echinobotryum atrum_, on the flocci of black moulds.\r\n\r\nIn the other section of _Coniomycetes_ the species are parasitic upon,\r\nand destructive to, living plants, very seldom being found on\r\nreally dead substances, and even in such rare cases undoubtedly\r\ndeveloped during the life of the tissues. Mostly the ultimate stage\r\nof these parasites is exhibited in the ruptured cuticle, and the\r\ndispersion of the dust-like spores; but in _Tilletia caries_,\r\n_Thecaphora hyalina_, and _Puccinia incarcerata_, they remain enclosed\r\nwithin the fruit of the foster-plant. The different genera exhibit\r\nin some instances a liking for plants of certain orders on which\r\nto develop themselves. _Peridermium_ attacks the _Coniferæ_;\r\n_Gymnosporangium_ and _Podisoma_ the different species of Juniper;\r\n_Melampsora_ chiefly the leaves of deciduous trees; _Roestelia_\r\nattaches itself to pomaceous trees, whilst _Graphiola_ affects the\r\n_Palmaceæ_, and _Endophyllum_ the succulent leaves of houseleek. In\r\n_Æcidium_ a few orders seem to be more liable to attack than\r\nothers, as the _Compositæ_, _Ranunculaceæ_, _Leguminosæ_, _Labiatæ_,\r\n&c., whilst others, as the _Graminaceæ_, _Ericaceæ_, _Malvaceæ_,\r\n_Cruciferæ_, are exempt. There are, nevertheless, very few natural\r\norders of phanerogamous plants in which some one or more species,\r\nbelonging to this section of the _Coniomycetes_, may not be found; and\r\nthe same foster-plant will occasionally nurture several forms.\r\nRecent investigations tend to confirm the distinct specific\r\ncharacters of the species found on different plants, and to prove\r\nthat the parasite of one host will not vegetate upon another,\r\nhowever closely allied. This admission must not, however, be\r\naccepted as universally applicable, and therefore it should not be\r\nassumed, because a certain parasite is found developed on a special\r\nhost, that it is distinct, unless distinctive characters, apart from\r\nhabitat, can be detected. _Æcidium compositarum_ and _Æcidium\r\nranunculacearum_, for instance, are found on various composite and\r\nranunculaceous plants, and as yet no sufficient evidence has been\r\nadduced to prove that the different forms are other than varieties\r\nof one of the two species. On the other hand, it is not improbable\r\nthat two species of _Æcidium_ are developed on the common berberry,\r\nas De Bary has indicated that two species of mildew, _Puccinia\r\ngraminis_, and _Puccinia straminis_, are found on wheat.\r\n\r\nHYPHOMYCETES.--The moulds are much more universal in their habitats,\r\nespecially the _Mucedines_. The _Isariacei_ have a predilection for\r\nanimal substances, though not exclusively. Some species occur on dead\r\ninsects, others on decaying fungi, and the rest on sticks, stems, and\r\nrotten wood. The _Stilbacei_ have also similar habitats, except that\r\nthe species of _Illosporium_ seem to be confined to parasitism on\r\nlichens. The black moulds, _Dematiei_, are widely diffused, appearing\r\non herbaceous stems, twigs, bark, and wood in most cases, but also on\r\nold linen, paper, millboard, dung, rotting fruit, &c., whilst forms of\r\n_Cladosporium_ and _Macrosporium_ are met with on almost every kind of\r\nvegetable substance in which the process of decay has commenced.\r\n\r\n_Mucedines_, in some instances, have not been known to appear on\r\nmore than one kind of matrix, but in the far greater number of cases\r\nthey nourish on different substances. _Aspergillus glaucus_ and\r\n_Penicillium crustaceum_ are examples of these universal _Mucedines_.\r\nIt would be far more difficult to mention substances on which\r\nthese moulds are never developed than to indicate where they have been\r\nfound. With the species of _Peronospora_ it is different, for these\r\nare truly parasitic on living plants, and, as far as already known,\r\nthe species are confined to certain special plants, and cannot be\r\nmade to vegetate on any other. The species which causes the potato\r\nmurrain, although liable to attack the tomato, and other species of\r\n_Solanaceæ_, does not extend its ravages beyond that natural order,\r\nwhilst _Peronospora parasitica_ confines itself to cruciferous plants.\r\nOne species is restricted to the _Umbelliferæ_, another, or perhaps\r\ntwo, to the _Leguminosæ_, another to _Rubiaceæ_, two or three to\r\n_Ranunculaceæ_, and two or three to _Caryophyllaceæ_. All the\r\nexperiments made by De Bary seem to prove that the species of\r\n_Peronospora_ will only flourish on certain favoured plants, to the\r\nexclusion of all others. The non-parasitic moulds are scarcely\r\nexclusive. In _Oidium_ some species are parasitic, but probably all\r\nthe parasitic forms are states of _Erysiphe_, the non-parasitic\r\nalone being autonomous; of these one occurs on _Porrigo lupinosa_,\r\nothers on putrefying oranges, pears, apples, plums, &c., and one\r\non honeycomb. _Acrospeira_ grows in the interior of sweet chestnuts,\r\nand we have seen a species growing within the hard testa of the\r\nseeds of _Guilandina Bondue_, from India, to which there was no\r\nexternal opening visible, and which was broken with considerable\r\ndifficulty. Several _Mucedines_ are developed on the dung of\r\nvarious animals, and seldom on anything else.\r\n\r\nThe _Physomycetes_ consist of two orders, _Antennariei_ and\r\n_Mucorini_, which differ from each other almost as much in habitat as\r\nin external appearance. The former, if represented by _Antennaria_,\r\nruns over the green and fading leaves of plants, forming a dense black\r\nstratum, like a congested layer of soot; or in _Zasmidium_, the common\r\ncellar fungus, runs over the walls, bottles, corks, and other\r\nsubstances, like a thick sooty felt. In the _Mucorini_, as in the\r\n_Mucedines_, there is usually less restriction to any special\r\nsubstance. _Mucor mucedo_ occurs on bread, paste, preserves, and\r\nvarious substances; other species of _Mucor_ seem to have a preference\r\nfor dung, and some for decaying fungi, but rotting fruits are nearly\r\nsure to support one or other of the species. The two known species of\r\nthe curious genus _Pilobolus_, as well as _Hydrophora_, are confined\r\nto dung. _Sporodinia_, _Syzygites_, &c., nourish on rotten Agarics,\r\nwhere they pass through their somewhat complicated existence.\r\n\r\nThe _Ascomycetes_ contain an immense number of species, and in general\r\nterms we might say that they are found everywhere. The _Tuberacei_ are\r\nsubterraneous, with a preference for calcareous districts. The\r\n_Perisporiacei_ are partly parasitical and partly not. The _Erysiphei_\r\ninclude those of the former which flourish at the expense of the green\r\nparts of roses, hops, maples, poplars, peas, and many other plants,\r\nboth in Europe and in North America, whilst in warmer latitudes the\r\ngenus _Meliola_ appears to take their place.\r\n\r\nThe _Elvellacei_ are fleshy fungi, of which the larger forms are\r\nterrestrial; _Morchella_, _Gyromitra_, and _Helvella_ mostly growing\r\nin woods, _Mitrula_, _Spathularia_, and _Leotia_ in swampy places, and\r\n_Geoglossum_ amongst grass. The very large genus _Peziza_ is divided\r\ninto groups, of which _Aleuriæ_ are mostly terrestrial. This group\r\nincludes nearly all the large-sized species, although a few belong to\r\nthe next. _Lachneæ_ are partly terrestrial and partly epiphytal, the\r\nmost minute species being found on twigs and leaves of dead plants. In\r\n_Phialea_ the species are nearly entirely epiphytal, as is also the\r\ncase in _Helotium_ and allied genera. Some species of _Peziza_ are\r\ndeveloped from the curious masses of compact mycelium called\r\n_Sclerotia_. A few are rather eccentric in their habitats. _P.\r\nviridaria_, _P. domestica_, and _P. hoemastigma_, grow on damp walls;\r\n_P. granulata_ and some others on dung. _Peziza Bullii_ was found\r\ngrowing on a cistern. _P. theleboloides_ appears in profusion on spent\r\nhops. _P. episphæria_, _P. clavariarum_, _P. vulgaris_, _Helotium\r\npruinosum_, and others are parasitic on old fungi. One or two species\r\nof _Helotium_ grow on submerged sticks, so as to be almost aquatic, a\r\ncircumstance of rare occurrence in fungi. Other _Discomycetes_ are\r\nsimilar in their habitats to the _Elvellacei_. The group to which the\r\nold genus _Ascobolus_ belongs is in a great measure confined to the\r\ndung of various animals, although there are two or three lignicolous\r\nspecies; and _Ascophanus saccharinus_ was first found on old leather,\r\n_Ascophanus testaceus_ on old sacking, &c. _Ascomyces_ is, perhaps,\r\nthe lowest form which ascomycetous fungi assume, and the species are\r\nparasitic on growing plants, distorting the leaves and fruit,\r\nconstituting themselves pests to the cultivators of peach, pear, and\r\nplum trees.\r\n\r\nThe _Sphæriacei_ include a very large number of species which grow on\r\nrotten wood, bark, sticks, and twigs; another group is developed on\r\ndead herbaceous stems; yet another is confined to dead or dying\r\nleaves. One genus, _Torrubia_, grows chiefly on insects; _Hypomyces_\r\nis parasitic on dead fungi; _Claviceps_ is developed from ergot,\r\n_Poronia_ on dung, _Polystigma_ on living leaves, as well as some\r\nspecies of _Stigmatea_ and _Dothidea_. Of the genus _Sphæria_, a\r\nconsiderable number are found on dung, now included by some authors\r\nunder _Sordaria_ and _Sporormia_, genera founded, as we think, on\r\ninsufficient characters. A limited number of species are parasitic on\r\nlichens, and one species only is known to be aquatic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--_Torrubia militaris_ on pupa of a moth.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus rapidly, briefly, and casually indicated the habitats to\r\nwhich the majority of the larger groups of fungi are attached,\r\nregarding them from a systematic point of view. There is, however,\r\nanother aspect from which we might approach the subject, taking\r\nthe host or matrix, or in fact the habitat, as the basis, and\r\nendeavouring to ascertain what species of fungi are to be found in\r\nsuch positions. This has partly been done by M. Westendorp;[E] but\r\nevery year adds considerably to the number of species, and what might\r\nhave been moderately accurate twelve years since can scarcely be so\r\nnow. To carry this out fully a special work would be necessary, so\r\nthat we shall be content to indicate or suggest, by means of a few\r\nillustrations, the forms of fungi, often widely distinct in\r\nstructure and character, to be found in the same locality.\r\n\r\nThe stems of herbaceous plants are favourite habitats for minute\r\nfungi. The old stems of the common nettle, for example, perform the\r\noffice of host to about thirty species.[F] Of these about nine are\r\n_Pezizæ_, and there are as many sphæriaceous fungi, whilst three\r\nspecies of _Dendryphium_, besides other moulds, select this plant.\r\nSome of these have not hitherto been detected growing on any other\r\nstems, such as _Sphæria urticæ_ and _Lophiostoma sex-nucleatum_, to\r\nwhich we might add _Peziza fusarioides_ and _Dendryphium griseum_.\r\nThese do not, however, include the whole of the fungi found on the\r\nnettle, since others are parasitic upon its living green parts. Of\r\nthese may be named _Æcidium urticæ_ and _Peronospora urticæ_, as well\r\nas two species described by Desmazières as _Fusisporium urticæ_ and\r\n_Septoria urticæ_. Hence it will be seen how large a number of fungi\r\nmay attach themselves to one herbaceous plant, sometimes whilst\r\nliving, but most extensively when dead. This is by no means a solitary\r\ninstance, but a type of what takes place in many others. If, on the\r\nother hand, we select such a tree as the common lime, we shall find\r\nthat the leaves, twigs, branches, and wood bear, according to M.\r\nWestendorp,[G] no less than seventy-four species of fungi, and of\r\nthese eleven occur on the leaves. The spruce fir, according to the\r\nsame authority, nourishes one hundred and fourteen species, and the\r\noak not less than two hundred.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note how fungi are parasitic upon each other in some\r\ninstances, as in that of _Hypomyces_, characteristic of the genus, in\r\nwhich sphæriaceous fungi make hosts of dead _Lactarii_, &c. We have\r\nalready alluded to _Nyctalis_, growing on decayed _Russulæ_, to\r\n_Boletus parasiticus_, flourishing on old _Scleroderma_, and to\r\n_Agaricus Loveianus_, on the pileus of _Agaricus nebularis_. To these\r\nwe may add _Torrubia ophioglossoides_ and _T. capitata_, which\r\nflourish on decaying _Elaphomyces_, _Stilbum tomentosum_ on old\r\n_Trichia_, _Peziza Clavariarum_ on dead _Clavaria_, and many others,\r\nthe mere enumeration of which would scarcely prove interesting. A very\r\ncurious little parasite was found by Messrs. Berkeley and Broome, and\r\nnamed by them _Hypocrea inclusa_, which makes itself a home in the\r\ninterior of truffles. Mucors and moulds flourish on dead and decaying\r\nAgarics, and other fleshy forms, in great luxuriance and profusion.\r\n_Mucor ramosus_ is common on _Boletus luridus_, and _Syzygites\r\nmegalocarpus_ on Agarics, as well as _Acrostalagmus cinnabarinus_. A\r\nvery curious little parasite, _Echinobotryum atrum_, occurs like\r\nminute nodules on the flocci of black moulds. _Bactridium Helvellæ_\r\nusurps the fructifying disc of species of _Peziza_. A small\r\n_Sphinctrina_ is found both in Britain and the United States on old\r\n_Polypori_. In _Sphæria nigerrima_, _Nectria episphæria_, and two or\r\nthree others, we have examples of one sphæriaceous fungus growing\r\nupon another.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips has recently indicated the species of fungi found by him\r\non charcoal beds in Shropshire,[H] but, useful as it is, that only\r\nrefers to one locality. A complete list of all the fungi which have\r\nbeen found growing on charcoal beds, burnt soil, or charred wood,\r\nwould be rather extensive. The fungi found in hothouses and stoves are\r\nalso numerous, and often of considerable interest from the fact that\r\nthey have many of them never been found elsewhere. Those found in\r\nBritain,[I] for instance, are excluded from the British Flora as\r\ndoubtful, because, growing upon or with exotic plants, they are deemed\r\nto be of exotic origin, yet in very few cases are they known to be\r\ninhabitants of any foreign country. Some species found in such\r\nlocalities are not confined to them, as _Agaricus coepestipes_,\r\n_Agaricus cristatus_, _Æthalium vaporarium_, &c. It is somewhat\r\nsingular that certain species have a predilection for growing in\r\nproximity with other plants with which they do not appear to have any\r\nmore intimate relation. Truffles, for instance, in association with\r\noaks, _Peziza lanuginosa_ under cedar-trees, _Hydnangium carneum_\r\nabout the roots of _Eucalypti_, and numerous species of _Agaricini_,\r\nwhich are only found under trees of a particular kind. As might be\r\nanticipated, there is no more fertile habitat for fungi than the dung\r\nof animals, and yet the kinds found in such locations belong to but a\r\nfew groups. Amongst the _Discomycetes_, a limited number of the genus\r\n_Peziza_ are fimicolous, but the allied genus _Ascobolus_, and its own\r\nimmediate allies, include amongst its species a large majority that\r\nare found on dung. If we take the number of species at sixty-four,\r\nthere are only seven or eight which do not occur on dung, whilst\r\nfifty-six are fimicolous. The species of _Sphæria_ which are found on\r\nthe same substances are also closely allied, and some Continental\r\nauthors have grouped them under the two proposed genera _Sporormia_\r\nand _Sordaria_, whilst Fuckel[J] proposes a distinct group of\r\n_Sphæriacei_, under the name of _Fimicoli_, in which he includes as\r\ngenera _Coprolepa_, _Hypocopra_, _Delitschia_, _Sporormia_,\r\n_Pleophragmia_, _Malinvernia_, _Sordaria_, and _Cercophora_. The two\r\nspecies of _Pilobolus_, and some of _Mucor_, are also found on dung,\r\n_Isaria felina_ on that of cats, _Stilbum fimetarium_ and a few other\r\nmoulds, and amongst Agarics some species of _Coprinus_. Animal\r\nsubstances are not, as a rule, prolific in the production of fungi.\r\n_Ascobolus saccharinus_ and one or two others have been found upon old\r\nleather. _Onygena_ of two or three species occurs on old horn, hoofs,\r\n&c. Cheese, milk, &c., afford a few forms, but the largest number\r\ninfest dead insects, either under the mouldy form of _Isaria_ or the\r\nmore perfect condition of _Torrubia_, and occasionally under other\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nRobin[K] has recorded that three species of _Brachinus_, of the order\r\nColeoptera, have been found infected, whilst living, with a minute\r\nyellow fungus which he calls _Laboulbenia Rougeti_, and the same\r\nspecies has been noted on other beetles. _Torrubia Melolonthæ_[L] has\r\nbeen described by Tulasne as occurring on the maybug or cockchafer,\r\nwhich is allied to, if not identical with, _Cordyceps Ravenelii_, B.\r\nand C., and also that described and figured by M. Fougeroux de\r\nBondaroy.[M] _Torrubia curculionum_, Tul., occurs on several species\r\nof beetles, and seems to be by no means uncommon in Brazil and Central\r\nAmerica. _Torrubia coespitosa_, Tul., which may be the same as\r\n_Cordyceps Sinclairi_, B.,[N] is found on the larvæ of _Orthoptera_ in\r\nNew Zealand, _Torrubia Miquelii_ on the larvæ of _Cicada_ in Brazil,\r\nand _Torrubia sobolifera_ on the pupæ of _Cicada_ in the West Indies.\r\nA romantic account is given of this in an extract cited by Dr. Watson\r\nin his communication to the Royal Society.[O] \"The vegetable fly is\r\nfound in the island Dominica, and (excepting that it has no wings)\r\nresembles the drone, both in size and colour, more than any other\r\nEnglish insect. In the month of May it buries itself in the earth and\r\nbegins to vegetate. By the latter end of July, the tree is arrived at\r\nits full growth, and resembles a coral branch, and is about three\r\ninches high, and bears several little pods, which, dropping off,\r\nbecome worms, and from thence flies, like the English caterpillar.\"\r\n_Torrubia Taylori_, which grows from the caterpillar of a large moth\r\nin Australia, is one of the finest examples of the genus. _Torrubia\r\nRobertsii_, from New Zealand, has long been known as attacking the\r\nlarva of _Hepialus virescens_. There are several other species on\r\nlarvæ of different insects, on spiders, ants, wasps, &c., and one or\r\ntwo on mature Lepidoptera, but the latter seem to be rare.\r\n\r\nThat fungi should make their appearance and flourish in localities and\r\nconditions generally considered inimical to vegetable life is no less\r\nstrange than true. We have already alluded to the occurrence of some\r\nspecies on spent tan, and some others have been found in locations as\r\nstrange. We have seen a yellow mould resembling _Sporotrichum_ in the\r\nheart of a ball of opium, also a white mould appears on the same\r\nsubstance, and more than one species is troublesome in the opium\r\nfactories of India. A mould made its appearance some years since in a\r\ncopper solution employed for electrotyping in the Survey Department of\r\nthe United States,[P] decomposing the salt, and precipitating the\r\ncopper. Other organisms have appeared from time to time in various\r\ninorganic solutions, some of which were considered destructive to\r\nvegetable life, and it is not improbable that some of these organisms\r\nwere low conditions of mould. It may well occasion some surprise that\r\nfungi should be found growing within cavities wholly excluded from the\r\nexternal air, as in the hollow of filberts, and the harder shelled\r\nnuts of _Guilandina_, in the cavities of the fruit of tomato, or in\r\nthe interior of an egg. It is scarcely less extraordinary that\r\n_Hypocrea inclusa_ should flourish in the interior of a kind of\r\ntruffle.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be concluded that the habitats of fungi are\r\nexceedingly variable, that they may be regarded as almost universal\r\nwherever decaying vegetable matter is found, and that under some\r\nconditions animal substances, especially of vegetable feeders, such as\r\ninsects, furnish a pabulum for their development.\r\n\r\nA very curious and interesting inquiry presents itself to our minds,\r\nwhich is intimately related to this subject of the habitats of fungi.\r\nIt shapes itself into a sort of \"puzzle for the curious,\" but at the\r\nsame time one not unprofitable to think about. How is the occurrence\r\nof new and before unknown forms to be accounted for in a case like the\r\nfollowing?[Q]\r\n\r\nIt was our fortune--good fortune as far as this investigation was\r\nconcerned--to have a portion of wall in our dwelling persistently damp\r\nfor some months. It was close to a cistern which had become leaky. The\r\nwall was papered with \"marbled\" paper, and varnished. At first there\r\nwas for some time nothing worthy of observation, except a damp\r\nwall--decidedly damp, discoloured, but not by any means mouldy. At\r\nlength, and rather suddenly, patches of mould, sometimes two or three\r\ninches in diameter, made their appearance. These were at first of a\r\nsnowy whiteness, cottony and dense, just like large tufts of cotton\r\nwool, of considerable expansion, but of miniature elevation. They\r\nprojected from the paper scarcely a quarter of an inch. In the course\r\nof a few weeks the colour of the tufts became less pure, tinged with\r\nan ochraceous hue, and resembling wool rather than cotton, less\r\nbeautiful to the naked eye, or under a lens, and more entangled. Soon\r\nafter this darker patches made their appearance, smaller, dark olive,\r\nand mixed with, or close to, the woolly tufts; and ultimately similar\r\nspots of a dendritic character either succeeded the olive patches, or\r\nwere independently formed. Finally, little black balls, like small pin\r\nheads, or grains of gunpowder, were found scattered about the damp\r\nspots. All this mouldy forest was more than six months under constant\r\nobservation, and during that period was held sacred from the\r\ndisturbing influences of the housemaid's broom and duster.\r\n\r\nCuriosity prompted us from the first to submit the mouldy denizens of\r\nthe wall to the microscope, and this curiosity was increased week by\r\nweek, on finding that none of the forms found vegetating on nearly two\r\nsquare yards of damp wall could be recognized as agreeing specifically\r\nwith any described moulds with which we were acquainted. Here was a\r\nproblem to be solved under the most favourable conditions, a forest of\r\nmould indoors, within a few yards of the fireside, growing quite\r\nnaturally, and all strangers. Whence could these new forms proceed?\r\n\r\nThe cottony tufts of white mould, which were the first to appear, had\r\nan abundant mycelium, but the erect threads which sprang from this\r\nwere for a long time sterile, and closely interlaced. At length\r\nfertile threads were developed in tufts, mixed with the sterile\r\nthreads. These fruit-bearers were shorter and stouter, more sparingly\r\nbranched, but beset throughout nearly their whole length with short\r\npatent, alternate branchlets. These latter were broadest towards the\r\napex, so as to be almost clavate, and the extremity was beset with two\r\nor three short spicules. Each spicule was normally surmounted by an\r\nobovate spore. The presence of fertile threads imparted the ochraceous\r\ntint above alluded to. This tint was slight, and perhaps would not\r\nhave been noticed, but from the close proximity of the snow-white\r\ntufts of barren threads. The fertile flocci were decumbent, probably\r\nfrom the weight of the spores, and the tufts were a little elevated\r\nabove the surface of the matrix. This mould belonged clearly to the\r\n_Mucedines_, but it hardly accorded well with any known genus,\r\nalthough most intimately related to _Rhinotrichum_, in which it was\r\nplaced as _Rhinotrichum lanosum_.[R]\r\n\r\nThe white mould having become established for a week or two, small\r\nblackish spots made their appearance on the paper, sometimes amongst\r\nthin patches of the mould, and sometimes outside them. These spots, at\r\nfirst cloudy and indefinite, varied in size, but were usually less\r\nthan a quarter of an inch in diameter. The varnish of the paper was\r\nafterwards pushed off in little translucent flakes or scales, an\r\nerect olivaceous mould appeared, and the patches extended to nearly an\r\ninch in diameter, maintaining an almost universal circular form. This\r\nnew mould sometimes possessed a dirty reddish tint, but was commonly\r\ndark olive. There could be no mistake about the genus to which this\r\nmould belonged; it had all the essential characters of _Penicillium_.\r\nErect jointed threads, branched in the upper portion in a fasciculate\r\nmanner, and bearing long beaded threads of spores, which formed a\r\ntassel-like head, at the apex of each fertile thread. Although at\r\nfirst reminded of _Penicillium olivaceum_, of Corda, by the colour of\r\nthis species, it was found to differ in the spores being oblong\r\ninstead of globose, and the ramifications of the flocci were\r\ndifferent. Unable again to find a described species of _Penicillium_\r\nwith which this new mould would agree, it was described under the name\r\nof _Penicillium chartarum_.[S]\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously, or but shortly after the perfection of the\r\nspores of _Penicillium_, other and very similar patches appeared,\r\ndistinguished by the naked eye more particularly by their dendritic\r\nform. This peculiarity seemed to result from the dwarfed habit of the\r\nthird fungus, since the varnish, though cracked and raised, was not\r\ncast off, but remained in small angular fragments, giving to the spots\r\ntheir dendritic appearance, the dark spores of the fungus protruding\r\nthrough the fissures. This same mould was also found in many cases\r\ngrowing in the same spots amongst _Penicillium chartarum_, but whether\r\nfrom the same mycelium could not be determined.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing features of this fungus consist in an extensive\r\nmycelium of delicate threads, from which arise numerous erect\r\nbranches, bearing at the apex dark brown opaque spores. Sometimes the\r\nbranches were again shortly branched, but in the majority of instances\r\nwere single. The septate spores had from two to four divisions, many\r\nof them divided again by cross septa in the longitudinal direction of\r\nthe spore, so as to impart a muriform appearance. As far as the\r\nstructure and appearance of the spores are concerned, they resembled\r\nthose of _Sporidesmium polymorphum_, under which name specimens were\r\nat first published,[T] but this determination was not satisfactory.\r\nThe mycelium and erect threads are much too highly developed for a\r\ngood species of _Sporidesmium_, although the name of _Sporidesmium\r\nalternaria_ was afterwards adopted. In fresh specimens of this fungus,\r\nwhen seen _in situ_ by a half-inch objective, the spores appear to be\r\nmoniliform, but if so, all attempts to see them so connected, when\r\nseparated from the matrix, failed. On one occasion, a very immature\r\ncondition was examined, containing simple beaded, hyaline bodies,\r\nattached to each other by a short neck. The same appearance of beaded\r\nspores, when seen _in situ_, was recognized by a mycological friend,\r\nto whom specimens were submitted for confirmation.[U]\r\n\r\nThe last production which made its appearance on our wall-paper burst\r\nthrough the varnish as little black spheres, like grains of gunpowder.\r\nAt first the varnish was elevated by pressure from beneath, then\r\nthe film was broken, and the little blackish spheres appeared. These\r\nwere, in the majority of cases, gregarious, but occasionally a few of\r\nthe spheres appeared singly, or only two or three together. As the\r\nwhole surface of the damp paper was covered by these different\r\nfungi, it was scarcely possible to regard any of them as isolated,\r\nor to declare that one was not connected with the mycelium of the\r\nothers. The little spheres, when the paper was torn from the wall,\r\nwere also growing from the under surface, flattened considerably by\r\nthe pressure. The spherical bodies, or perithecia, were seated on a\r\nplentiful hyaline mycelium. The walls of the perithecia, rather more\r\ncarbonaceous than membranaceous, are reticulated, reminding one of\r\nthe conceptacles of _Erysiphe_, to which the perithecia bear\r\nconsiderable resemblance. The ostiolum is so obscure that we doubt\r\nits existence, and hence the closer affinity of the plant to the\r\n_Perisporiacei_ than to the _Sphæriacei_. The interior of the\r\nperithecium is occupied by a gelatinous nucleus, consisting of\r\nelongated cylindrical asci, each enclosing eight globose hyaline\r\nsporidia, with slender branched paraphyses. A new genus has been\r\nproposed for this and another similar form, and the present\r\nspecies bears the name of _Orbicula cyclospora_.[V]\r\n\r\nThe most singular circumstance connected with this narrative is the\r\npresence together of four distinctly different species of fungi, all\r\nof them previously unknown and undescribed, and no trace amongst them\r\nof the presence of any one of the very common species, which would be\r\nsupposed to develop themselves under such circumstances. It is not at\r\nall unusual for _Sporocybe alternata_, B., to appear in broad black\r\npatches on damp papered walls, but in this instance not a trace was to\r\nbe found. What were the peculiar conditions present in this instance\r\nwhich led to the manifestation of four new forms, and none of the old\r\nones? We confess that we are unable to account satisfactorily for the\r\nmystery, but, at the same time, feel equally unwilling to invent\r\nhypotheses in order to conceal our own ignorance.\r\n\r\n   [A] These predilections must be accepted as general, to which there\r\n       will be exceptions.\r\n\r\n   [B] Viviani, \"I Funghi d'Italia.\"\r\n\r\n   [C] Badham's \"Esculent Funguses,\" Ed. i. pp. 42, 116.\r\n\r\n   [D] An excellent white Agaric occurs on ant nests in the\r\n       Neilgherries, and a curious species is found in a similar\r\n       position in Ceylon.\r\n\r\n   [E] Westendorp, \"Les Cryptogams après leurs stations naturelles.\"\r\n\r\n   [F] Cooke, \"On Nettle Stems and their Micro-Fungi,\" in \"Journ.\r\n       Quekett Micro.

Efforts have been made on the Continent for the cultivation of\r\ntruffles, but the success has hitherto been somewhat doubtful. For the\r\ngrowth of the common mushroom, very little trouble and care is\r\nrequired, and moderate success is certain. A friend of ours some years\r\nsince was fortunate enough to have one or two specimens of the large\r\npuff-ball, _Lycoperdon giganteum_, growing in his garden. Knowing its\r\nvalue, and being particularly fond of it when fried for breakfast, he\r\nwas anxious to secure its permanence. The spot on which the specimens\r\nappeared was marked off and guarded, so that it was never desecrated\r\nby the spade, and the soil remained consequently undisturbed. Year\r\nafter year, so long as he resided on the premises, he counted upon and\r\ngathered several specimens of the puff-ball, the mycelium continuing\r\nto produce them year after year. All parings, fragments, &c., not\r\nutilized of the specimens eaten were cast on this spot to rot, so that\r\nsome of the elements might be returned to the soil. This was not true\r\ncultivation perhaps, as the fungus had first established itself, but\r\nit was preservation, and had its reward. It must be admitted, however,\r\nthat the size and number of specimens diminished gradually, probably\r\nfrom exhaustion of the soil. This fungus, though strong, is much\r\napproved by many palates, and its cultivation might be attempted.\r\nBurying a ripe specimen in similar soil, and watering ground with the\r\nspores, has been tried without success.[A]\r\n\r\nAs to the methods adopted for cultivation of the common mushroom,\r\nit is unnecessary to detail them here, as there are several special\r\ntreatises devoted to the subject, in which the particulars are\r\nmore fully given than the limits of this chapter will permit.[B]\r\nRecently, M. Chevreul exhibited at the French Academy some splendid\r\nmushrooms, said to have been produced by the following method: he\r\nfirst develops the mushrooms by sowing spores on a pane of glass,\r\ncovered with wet sand; then he selects the most vigorous individuals\r\nfrom among them, and sows, or plants their mycelium in a cellar in\r\na damp soil, consisting of gardener's mould, covered with a layer\r\nof sand and gravel two inches thick, and another layer of rubbish from\r\ndemolitions, about an inch deep. The bed is watered with a diluted\r\nsolution of nitrate of potash, and in about six days the mushrooms\r\ngrow to an enormous size.[C] The cultivation of mushrooms for the\r\nmarket, even in this country, is so profitable, that curious\r\nrevelations sometimes crop up, as at a recent trial at the Sheriffs'\r\nCourt for compensation by the Metropolitan Railway Company for\r\npremises and business of a nurseryman at Kensington. The Railway had\r\ntaken possession of a mushroom-ground, and the claim for compensation\r\nwas £716. It was stated in evidence that the profits on mushrooms\r\namounted to 100 or 150 per cent. One witness said if £50 were\r\nexpended, in twelve months, or perhaps in six months, the sum\r\nrealized would be £200.\r\n\r\nImmense quantities of mushrooms are produced in Paris, as is well\r\nknown, in caves, and interesting accounts have been written of visits\r\nto these subterranean mushroom-vaults of the gay city. In one of these\r\ncaves, at Montrouge, the proprietor gathers largely every day,\r\noccasionally sending more than 400 pounds weight per day to market,\r\nthe average being about 300 pounds. There are six or seven miles' run\r\nof mushroom-beds in this cave, and the owner is only one of a large\r\nclass who devote themselves to the culture of mushrooms. Large\r\nquantities of preserved mushrooms are exported, one house sending to\r\nEngland not less than 14,000 boxes in a year. Another cave near\r\nFrépillon was in full force in 1867, sending as many as 3,000 pounds\r\nof mushrooms to the Parisian markets daily. In 1867, M. Renaudot had\r\nover twenty-one miles of mushroom-beds in one great cave at Méry, and\r\nin 1869 there were sixteen miles of beds in a cave at Frépillon. The\r\ntemperature of these caves is so equal that the cultivation of the\r\nmushroom is possible at all seasons of the year, but the best crops\r\nare gathered in the winter.\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson gives an excellent account, not only of the subterranean,\r\nbut also of the open-air culture of mushrooms about Paris. The\r\nopen-air culture is never pursued in Paris during the summer, and\r\nrarely so in this country.[D] What might be termed the domestic\r\ncultivation of mushrooms is easy, that is, the growth by inexperienced\r\npersons, for family consumption, of a bed of mushrooms in cellars,\r\nwood-houses, old tubs, boxes, or other unconsidered places. Even in\r\ntowns and cities it is not impracticable, as horse-dung can always be\r\nobtained from mews and stables. Certainly fungi are never so\r\nharmless, or seldom so delicious, as when collected from the bed, and\r\ncooked at once, before the slightest chemical change or deterioration\r\ncould possibly take place.\r\n\r\nMr. Cuthill's advice may be repeated here. He says:--\"I must not\r\nforget to remind the cottager that it would be a shilling or two a\r\nweek saved to him during the winter, if he had a good little bed of\r\nmushrooms, even for his own family, to say nothing about a shilling or\r\ntwo that he might gain by selling to his neighbours. I can assure him\r\nmushrooms grow faster than pigs, and the mushrooms do not eat\r\nanything; they only want a little attention. Addressing myself to the\r\nworking classes, I advise them, in the first place, to employ their\r\nchildren or others collecting horse-droppings along the highway, and\r\nif mixed with a little road-sand, so much the better. They must be\r\ndeposited in a heap during summer, and trodden firmly. They will heat\r\na little, but the harder they are pressed the less they will heat.\r\nOver-heating must be guarded against; if the watch or trial stick\r\nwhich is inserted into them gets too hot for the hand to bear, the\r\nheat is too great, and will destroy the spawn. In that case artificial\r\nspawn must be used when the bed is made up, but this expedient is to\r\nbe avoided on account of the expense. The easiest way for a cottager\r\nto save his own spawn would be to do so when he destroys his old bed;\r\nhe will find all round the edges or driest parts of the dung one mass\r\nof superior spawn; let him keep this carefully in a very dry place,\r\nand when he makes up his next bed it can then be mixed with his summer\r\ndroppings, and will insure a continuance and excellent crop. These\r\nlittle collections of horse-droppings and road-sand, if kept dry in\r\nshed, hole, or corner, under cover, will in a short time generate\r\nplenty of spawn, and will be ready to be spread on the surface of the\r\nbed in early autumn, say by the middle of September or sooner. The\r\ndroppings during the winter must be put into a heap, and allowed to\r\nheat gently, say up to eighty or ninety degrees; then they must be\r\nturned over twice daily to let off the heat and steam; if this is\r\nneglected the natural spawn of the droppings is destroyed. The\r\ncottager should provide himself with a few barrowfuls of strawy dung\r\nto form the foundation of his bed, so that the depth, when all is\r\nfinished, be not less than a foot. Let the temperature be up to milk\r\nheat. He will then, when quite sure that the bed will not overheat,\r\nput on his summer droppings. By this time these will be one mass of\r\nnatural spawn, having a grey mouldy and thready appearance, and a\r\nsmell like that of mushrooms. Let all be pressed very hard; then let\r\nmould, unsifted, be put on, to the thickness of four inches, and\r\ntrodden down hard with the feet and watered all over; and the back of\r\na spade may now be used to make it still harder, as well as to plaster\r\nthe surface all over.\"[E] Mushrooms are cultivated very extensively by\r\nMr. Ingram, at Belvoir, without artificial spawn. There is a great\r\nriding-house there, in which the litter is ground down by the horses'\r\nfeet into very small shreds. These are placed in a heap and turned\r\nover once or twice during the season, when a large quantity of\r\nexcellent spawn is developed which, placed in asparagus beds or laid\r\nunder thin turf, produces admirable mushrooms, in the latter case as\r\nclean as in our best pastures.[F]\r\n\r\nOther species will sometimes be seen growing on mushroom-beds besides\r\nthe genuine mushroom, the spawn in such cases being probably\r\nintroduced with the materials employed. We have seen a pretty crisped\r\nvariety of _Agaricus dealbatus_ growing in profusion in such a place,\r\nand devoured it accordingly. Sometimes the mushrooms will, when in an\r\nunhealthy condition, be subject to the ravages of parasitic species of\r\nmould, or perhaps of _Hypomyces_. _Xylaria vaporaria_ has, in more\r\nthan one instance, usurped the place of mushrooms. Mr. Berkeley has\r\nreceived abundant specimens in the Sclerotioid state, which he\r\nsucceeded in developing in sand under a bell glass. Of course under\r\nsuch conditions there is much loss. The little fairy-ring champignon\r\nis an excellent and useful species, and it is a great pity that some\r\neffort should not be made to procure it by cultivation. In Italy a\r\nkind of _Polyporus_, unknown in this country, is obtained by watering\r\nthe _Pietra funghaia_, or fungus stone, a sort of tufa impregnated\r\nwith mycelium. The _Polypori_, it is said, take seven days to come to\r\nperfection, and may be obtained from the foster mass, if properly\r\nmoistened, six times a year. There are specimens which were fully\r\ndeveloped in Mr. Lee's nursery at Kensington many years since. Another\r\nfungus is obtained from the pollard head of the black poplar. Dr.\r\nBadham says that it is usual to remove these heads at the latter end\r\nof autumn, as soon as the vintage is over, and their marriage with the\r\nvine is annulled; hundreds of such heads are then cut and transported\r\nto different parts; they are abundantly watered during the first\r\nmonth, and in a short time produce that truly delicious fungus\r\n_Agaricus caudicinus_, which, during the autumn of the year, makes the\r\ngreatest show in the Italian market-places. These pollard blocks\r\ncontinue to bear for from twelve to fourteen years.\r\n\r\nAnother fungus, which Dr. Badham himself reared (_Polyporus\r\navellanus_), is procured by singeing, over a handful of straw, a block\r\nof the cob-nut tree, which is then watered and put by. In about a\r\nmonth the fungi make their appearance, and are quite white, of from\r\ntwo to three inches in diameter, and excellent to eat, while their\r\nprofusion is sometimes so great as entirely to hide the wood from\r\nwhence they spring.[G] It has been said that _Boletus edulis_ may be\r\npropagated by watering the ground with a watery infusion of the\r\nplants, but we have no knowledge of this method having been pursued\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\nThe culture of truffles has been partially attempted, on the principle\r\nthat, in some occult manner, certain trees produced truffles beneath\r\ntheir shade. It is true that truffles are found under trees of special\r\nkinds, for Mr. Broome remarks that some trees appear more favourable\r\nto the production of truffles than others. Oak and hornbeam are\r\nspecially mentioned; but, besides these, chestnut, birch, box, and\r\nhazel are alluded to. He generally found _Tuber oestivum_ under\r\nbeech-trees, but also under hazel, _Tuber macrosporum_ under oaks, and\r\n_Tuber brumale_ under oaks and abele. The men who collect truffles\r\nfor Covent Garden Market obtain them chiefly under beech, and in mixed\r\nplantations of fir and beech.[H]\r\n\r\nSome notion may be obtained of the extent to which the trade of\r\ntruffles is carried in France, when we learn that in the market of Apt\r\nalone about 3,500 pounds of truffles are exposed for sale every week\r\nduring the height of the season, and the quantity sold during the\r\nwinter reaches upwards of 60,000 pounds, whilst the Department of\r\nVaucluse yields annually upwards of 60,000 pounds. It may be\r\ninteresting here to state that the value of truffles is so great in\r\nItaly that precautions are taken against truffle poachers, much in the\r\nsame way as against game poachers in England. They train their dogs so\r\nskilfully that, while they stand on the outside of the truffle\r\ngrounds, the dogs go in and dig for the fungi. Though there are\r\nmultitudes of species, they bring out those only which are of market\r\nvalue. Some dogs, however, are employed by botanists, which will hunt\r\nfor any especial species that may be shown to them. The great\r\ndifficulty is to prevent them devouring the truffles, of which they\r\nare very fond. The best dogs, indeed, are true retrievers.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Borch and M. de Bornholz give the chief accounts of the\r\nefforts that have been made towards the cultivation of these fungi.\r\nThey state that a compost is prepared of pure mould and vegetable soil\r\nmixed with dry leaves and sawdust, in which, when properly moistened,\r\nmature truffles are placed in winter, either whole or in fragments,\r\nand that after the lapse of some time small truffles are found in the\r\ncompost.[I] The most successful plan consists in sowing acorns over a\r\nconsiderable extent of land of a calcareous nature; and when the young\r\noaks have attained the age of ten or twelve years, truffles are found\r\nin the intervals between the trees. This process was carried on in the\r\nneighbourhood of Loudun, where truffle-beds had formerly existed, but\r\nwhere they had long ceased to be productive--a fact indicating the\r\naptitude of the soil for the purpose. In this case no attempt was\r\nmade to produce truffles by placing ripe specimens in the earth, but\r\nthey sprang up themselves from spores probably contained in the soil.\r\nThe young trees were left rather wide apart, and were cut, for the\r\nfirst time, about the twelfth year after sowing, and afterwards at\r\nintervals of from seven to nine years. Truffles were thus obtained for\r\na period of from twenty-five to thirty years, after which the\r\nplantations ceased to be productive, owing, it was said, to the ground\r\nbeing too much shaded by the branches of the young trees. It is the\r\nopinion of the Messrs. Tulasne that the regular cultivation of the\r\ntruffle in gardens can never be so successful as this so-called\r\nindirect culture at Loudun, but they think that a satisfactory result\r\nmight be obtained in suitable soils by planting fragments of mature\r\ntruffles in wooded localities, taking care that the other conditions\r\nof the spots selected should be analogous to those of the regular\r\ntruffle-grounds, and they recommend a judicious thinning of the trees\r\nand clearing the surface from brushwood, etc., which prevents at once\r\nthe beneficial effects of rain and of the direct sun's rays. A truffle\r\ncollector stated to Mr. Broome that whenever a plantation of beech, or\r\nbeech and fir, is made on the chalk districts of Salisbury Plain,\r\nafter the lapse of a few years truffles are produced, and that these\r\nplantations continue productive for a period of from ten to fifteen\r\nyears, after which they cease to be so.\r\n\r\nM. Gasparin reported to the jurors of the Paris Exhibition of 1855,\r\nconcerning the operations of M. Rousseau, of Carpentras, on the\r\nproduction of oak truffles in France. The acorns of evergreen and of\r\ncommon oaks were sown about five yards apart. In the fourth year of\r\nthe plantation three truffles were found; at the date of the report\r\nthe trees were nine years old, and over a yard in height. Sows were\r\nemployed to search for the truffles. Although these plantations\r\nconsist both of the evergreen and common oak, truffles cannot be\r\ngathered at the base of the latter species, it so happening that it\r\narrives later at a state of production. The common oak, however,\r\nproduces truffles like the evergreen oak, this report states, for a\r\ngreat number of the natural truffle-grounds at Vaucluse are planted\r\nwith common oaks. It is remarked that the truffles produced from\r\nthese are larger but less regular than those of the evergreen oak,\r\nwhich are smaller, but nearly always spherical. The truffles are\r\ngathered at two periods of the year; in May only white truffles are to\r\nbe found, which never blacken and have no odour; they are dried and\r\nsold for seasoning. The black truffles (_Tuber melanosporum_) commence\r\nforming in June, enlarging towards the frosty season; then they become\r\nhard, and acquire all their perfume. They are dug a month before and a\r\nmonth after Christmas. It is also asserted that truffles are produced\r\nabout the vine, or at any rate that the association of the vine is\r\nfavourable to the production of truffles, because truffle-plots near\r\nvines are very productive. The observation of this decided M. Rousseau\r\nto plant a row of vines between the oaks. The result of this\r\nexperiment altogether does not appear to have been by any means\r\nflattering, for at the end of eight years only little more than\r\nfifteen pounds were obtained from a hectare of land, which, if valued\r\nat 45 francs, would leave very little profit. M. Rousseau also called\r\nattention to a meadow manured (_sic_) with parings of truffles, which\r\nwas said to have given prodigious results.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of minute fungi for scientific purposes has been\r\nincidentally alluded to and illustrated in foregoing chapters, and\r\nconsequently will not require such full and particular details\r\nhere. Somewhat intermediately, we might allude to the species of\r\n_Sclerotium_, which are usually compact, externally blackish,\r\nrounded or amorphous bodies, consisting of a cellular mass of the\r\nnature of a concentrated mycelium. Placed in favourable conditions,\r\nthese forms of _Sclerotium_ will develop the peculiar species of\r\nfungus belonging to them, but in certain cases the production is more\r\nrapid and easy than in others. In this country, Mr. F. Currey has\r\nbeen the most successful in the cultivation of _Sclerotia_. The\r\nmethod adopted is to keep them in a moist, somewhat warm, but\r\nequable atmosphere, and with patience await the results. The\r\nwell-known ergot of rye, wheat, and other grasses may be so\r\ncultivated, and Mr. Currey has developed the ergot of the common\r\nreed by keeping the stem immersed in water. The final conditions\r\nare small clavate bodies of the order _Sphæriacei_, belonging to\r\nthe genus _Claviceps_. The _Sclerotium_ of the _Eleocharis_ has been\r\nfound in this country, but we are not aware that the _Claviceps_\r\ndeveloped from it has been met with or induced by cultivation. One\r\nmethod recommended for this sort of experiment is to fill a\r\ngarden-pot half full of crocks, over which to place sphagnum broken\r\nup until the pot is nearly full, on this to place the _Sclerotia_,\r\nand cover with silver sand; if the pot is kept standing in a pan of\r\nwater in a warm room, it is stated that production will ensue.\r\nErgot of the grasses will not always develop under these conditions,\r\nbut perseverance may ultimately ensure success.\r\n\r\nA species of _Sclerotium_ on the gills of dead Agarics originates\r\n_Agaricus tuberosus_, another _Agaricus cirrhatus_,[J] but this should\r\nbe kept _in situ_ when cultivated artificially, and induced to develop\r\nwhilst still attached to the rotten Agarics. _Peziza tuberosa_, in\r\nlike manner, is developed from _Sclerotia_, usually found buried in\r\nthe ground in company with the roots of _Anemone nemorosa_. At one\r\ntime it was supposed that some relationship existed between the roots\r\nof the anemone and the _Sclerotia_. From another _Sclerotium_, found\r\nin the stems of bulrushes, Mr. Currey has developed a species of\r\n_Peziza_, which has been named _P. Curreyana_.[K] This _Peziza_ has\r\nbeen found growing naturally from the _Sclerotia_ imbedded in the\r\ntissue of common rushes. De Bary has recorded the development of\r\n_Peziza Fuckeliana_ from a _Sclerotium_ of which the conidia take the\r\nform of a species of _Polyactis_. _Peziza ciborioides_ is developed\r\nfrom a _Sclerotium_ found amongst dead leaves; and recently we have\r\nreceived from the United States an allied _Peziza_ which originated\r\nfrom the _Sclerotia_ found on the petals of _Magnolia_, and which has\r\nbeen named _Peziza gracilipes_, Cooke, from its very slender,\r\nthread-like stem. Other species of _Peziza_ are also known to be\r\ndeveloped from similar bases, and these Fuckel has associated\r\ntogether under a proposed new genus with the name of _Sclerotinia_.\r\nTwo or three species of _Typhula_, in like manner, spring from forms\r\nof _Sclerotium_, long known as _Sclerotium complanatum_ and\r\n_Sclerotium scutellatum_. Other forms of _Sclerotium_ are known, from\r\none of which, found in a mushroom-bed, Mr. Currey developed _Xylaria\r\nvaporaria_, B., by placing it on damp sand covered with a bell\r\nglass.[L] Others, again, are only known in the sclerotioid state, such\r\nas the _Sclerotium stipitatum_ found in the nests of white ants in\r\nSouth India.[M] From what is already known, however, we feel justified\r\nin the conclusion that the so-called species of _Sclerotium_ are a\r\nsort of compact mycelium, from which, under favourable conditions,\r\nperfect fungi may be developed. Mr. Berkeley succeeded in raising from\r\nthe minute _Sclerotium_ of onions, which looks like grains of coarse\r\ngunpowder, a species of _Mucor_. This was accomplished by placing a\r\nthin slice of the _Sclerotium_ in a drop of water under a glass slide,\r\nsurrounded by a pellicle of air, and luted to prevent evaporation and\r\nexternal influences.[N]\r\n\r\nAs to the cultivation of moulds and _Mucors_, one great difficulty has\r\nto be encountered in the presence or introduction of foreign spores to\r\nthe matrix employed for their development. Bearing this in mind,\r\nextensive cultivations may be made, but the conditions must influence\r\nthe decision upon the results. Rice paste has been used with advantage\r\nfor sowing the spores of moulds, afterwards keeping them covered from\r\nexternal influences. In cultivation on rice paste of rare species, the\r\nexperimenter is often perplexed by the more rapid growth of the common\r\nspecies of _Mucor_ and _Penicillium_. Mr. Berkeley succeeded in\r\ndeveloping up to a certain point the fungus of the Madura Foot, but\r\nthough perfect sporangia were produced, the further development was\r\nmasked by the outgrowth of other species. In like manner, orange\r\njuice, cut surfaces of fruits, slices of potato tubers, etc., have\r\nbeen employed. Fresh, horse-dung, placed under a bell glass and kept\r\nin a humid atmosphere, will soon be covered with _Mucor_, and in like\r\nmanner the growth of common moulds upon decayed fruit may be watched;\r\nbut this can hardly be termed cultivation unless the spores of some\r\nindividual species are sown. Different solutions have been proposed\r\nfor the growth of such conditions as the cells which induce\r\nfermentation, to which yeast plants belong. A fly attacked by _Empusa\r\nmuscæ_, if immersed in water, will develop one of the _Saprolegniæ_.\r\n\r\nThe _Uredines_ and other epiphyllous _Coniomycetes_ will readily\r\ngerminate by placing the leaf which bears them on damp sand, or\r\nkeeping them in a humid atmosphere. Messrs. Tulasne and De Bary have,\r\nin their numerous memoirs, detailed the methods adopted by them\r\nfor different species, both for germination of the pseudospores and\r\nfor impregnating healthy foster plants. The germination of the\r\npseudospores of the species of _Podisoma_ may easily be induced, and\r\nsecondary fruits obtained. The germination of the spores of _Tilletia_\r\nis more difficult to accomplish, but this may be achieved. Mr.\r\nBerkeley found no difficulty, and had the stem impregnated as well as\r\nthe germen. On the other hand, the pseudospores of _Cystopus_,\r\nwhen sown in water on a slip of glass, will soon produce the\r\ncurious little zoospores in the manner already described.\r\n\r\nThe sporidia of the _Discomycetes_, and some of the _Sphæriacei_,\r\ngerminate readily in a drop of water on a slip of glass, although not\r\nproceeding further than the protrusion of germ-tubes. A form of slide\r\nhas been devised for growing purposes, in which the large covering\r\nglass is held in position, and one end of the slip being kept immersed\r\nin a vessel of water, capillary attraction keeps up the supply for an\r\nindefinite period, so that there is no fear of a check from the\r\nevaporation of the fluid. Even when saccharine solutions are employed\r\nthis method may be adopted.\r\n\r\nThe special cultivation of the _Peronosporei_ occupied the attention\r\nof Professor De Bary for a long time, and his experiences are\r\ndetailed in his memoir on that group,[O] but which are too long\r\nfor quotation here, except his observations on the development of the\r\nthreads of _Peronospora infestans_ on the cut surface of the tubers\r\nof diseased potatoes. When a diseased potato is cut and sheltered from\r\ndessication, the surface of the slice covers itself with the mycelium\r\nand conidiiferous branches of _Peronospora_, and it can easily be\r\nproved that these organs originate from the intercellulary tubes of\r\nthe brown tissue. The mycelium that is developed upon these slices\r\nis ordinarily very vigorous; it often constitutes a cottony mass of a\r\nthickness of many millimetres, and it gives out conidiiferous\r\nbranches, often partitioned, and larger and more branched than those\r\nobserved on the leaves. The appearance of these fertile branches\r\nordinarily takes place at the end of from twenty-four to forty-eight\r\nhours; sometimes, nevertheless, one must wait for many days. These\r\nphenomena are observed in all the diseased tubercles without\r\nexception, so long as they have not succumbed to putrefaction,\r\nwhich arrests the development of the parasite and kills it.\r\n\r\nYoung plants of the species liable to attack may be inoculated with\r\nthe conidia of the species of _Peronospora_ usually developed on that\r\nparticular host, in the same manner that young cruciferous plants,\r\nwatered with an infusion of the spores of _Cystopus candidus_, will\r\nsoon exhibit evidence of attack from the white rust.\r\n\r\nIt is to the cultivation and close investigation of the growth and\r\nmetamorphoses of the minute fungi that we must look for the most\r\nimportant additions which have yet to be made to our knowledge of the\r\nlife-history of these most complex and interesting organisms.\r\n\r\n   [A] Experiments were made at Belvoir, by Mr. Ingram, in the\r\n       cultivation of several species of _Agaricini_, but without\r\n       success, and a similar fate attended some spawn of a very\r\n       superior kind from the Swan River, which was submitted to the\r\n       late Mr. J. Henderson. No result was obtained at Chiswick,\r\n       either from the cultivation of truffles or from the inoculation\r\n       of grass-plots with excellent spawn. Mr. Disney's experiments\r\n       at the Hyde, near Ingatestone, were made with dried truffles,\r\n       and were not likely to succeed. The Viscomte Nôe succeeded in\r\n       obtaining abundant truffles, in an enclosed portion of a wood\r\n       fenced from wild boars, by watering the ground with an infusion\r\n       of fresh specimens; but it is possible that as this took place\r\n       in a truffle country, there might have been a crop without any\r\n       manipulation. Similar trials, and it is said successfully, have\r\n       been made with _Boletus edulis_. Specimens of prepared\r\n       truffle-spawn were sent many years since to the \"Gardener's\r\n       Chronicle,\" but they proved useless, if indeed they really\r\n       contained any reliable spawn.\r\n\r\n   [B] Robinson, \"On Mushroom Culture,\" London, 1870.

The younger Fries,[A] with all the\r\nfacilities at his disposal which the lengthened experience and large\r\ncollections of his father afforded, could only give a very imperfect\r\noutline, and now we can add very little to what he has given. The\r\ncause of this difficulty lies in the fact that the Mycologic Flora of\r\nso large a portion of the world remains unexplored, not only in remote\r\nregions, but even in civilized countries where the Phanerogamic Flora\r\nis well known. Europe, England, Scotland, and Wales are as well\r\nexplored as any other country, but Ireland is comparatively unknown,\r\nno complete collection having ever been made, or any at least\r\npublished. Scandinavia has also been well examined, and the northern\r\nportions of France, with Belgium, some parts of Germany and Austria,\r\nin Russia the neighbourhood of St. Petersburg, and parts of Italy and\r\nSwitzerland. Turkey in Europe, nearly all Russia, Spain, and Portugal\r\nare almost unknown. As to North America, considerable advances have\r\nbeen made since Schweinitz by Messrs. Curtis and Ravenel, but their\r\ncollections in Carolina cannot be supposed to represent the whole of\r\nthe United States; the small collections made in Texas, Mexico, etc.,\r\nonly serve to show the richness of the country, not yet half\r\nexhausted. It is to be hoped that the young race of botanists in the\r\nUnited States will apply themselves to the task of investigating the\r\nMycologic Flora of this rich and fertile region. In Central America\r\nvery small and incomplete collections have as yet been made, and the\r\nsame may be said of South America and Canada. Of the whole extent of\r\nthe New World, only the Carolina States of North America can really be\r\nsaid to be satisfactorily known. Asia is still less known, the whole\r\nof our vast Indian Empire being represented by the collections made by\r\nDr. Hooker in the Sikkim Himalayas, and a few isolated specimens from\r\nother parts. Ceylon has recently been removed from the category of the\r\nunknown by the publication of its Mycologic Flora.[B] All that is\r\nknown of Java is supplied by the researches of Junghuhn; whilst all\r\nthe rest is completely unknown, including China, Japan, Siam, the\r\nMalayan Peninsula, Burmah, and the whole of the countries in the north\r\nand west of India. A little is known of the Philippines, and the\r\nIndian Archipelago, but this knowledge is too fragmentary to be of\r\nmuch service. In Africa no part has been properly explored, with the\r\nexception of Algeria, although something is known of the Cape of Good\r\nHope and Natal. The Australasian Islands are better represented in the\r\nFloras published of those regions. Cuba and the West Indies generally\r\nare moderately well known from the collections of Mr. C. Wright, which\r\nhave been recorded in the journal of the Linnæan Society, and in the\r\nsame journal Mr. Berkeley has described many Australian species.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above summary how unsatisfactory it must be\r\nto give anything like a general view of the geographical distribution\r\nof fungi, or to estimate at all approximately the number of species on\r\nthe globe. Any attempt, therefore, must be made and accepted subject\r\nto the limitations we have expressed.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which determine the distribution of fungi are not\r\nprecisely those which determine the distribution of the higher plants.\r\nIn the case of the parasitic species they may be said to follow the\r\ndistribution of their foster-plants, as in the case of the rust, smut,\r\nand mildew of the cultivated cereals, which have followed those\r\ngrains wherever they have been distributed, and the potato disease,\r\nwhich is said to have been known in the native region of the potato\r\nplant before it made its appearance in Europe. We might also allude to\r\n_Puccinia malvacearum_, Ca., which was first made known as a South\r\nAmerican species; it then travelled to Australia, and at length to\r\nEurope, reaching England the next year after it was recorded on the\r\nContinent. In the same manner, so far as we have the means of knowing,\r\n_Puccinia Apii_, Ca., was known on the Continent of Europe for some\r\ntime before it was detected on the celery plants in this country.\r\nExperience seems to warrant the conclusion that if a parasite affects\r\na certain plant within a definite area, it will extend in time beyond\r\nthat area to other countries where the foster-plant is found. This\r\nview accounts in some part for the discovery of species in this\r\ncountry, year after year, which had not been recorded before; some\r\nallowance being made for the fact that an increased number of\r\nobservers and collectors may cause the search to be more complete, yet\r\nit must be conceded that the migration of Continental species must to\r\nsome extent be going on, or how can it be accounted for that such\r\nlarge and attractive fungi as _Sparassis crispa_, _Helvellas gigas_,\r\nand _Morchella crassipes_ had never been recorded till recently, or\r\namongst parasitic species such as the two species of _Puccinia_ above\r\nnamed? In the same manner it is undoubtedly true that species which at\r\none time were common gradually become somewhat rare, and at length\r\nnearly extinct. We have observed this to apply to the larger species\r\nas well as to the microscopic in definite localities. For instance,\r\n_Craterellus cornucopioides_ some ten years ago appeared in one wood,\r\nat a certain spot, by hundreds, whereas during the past three or four\r\nyears we have failed to find a single specimen. As many years since,\r\nand in two places, where the goat's-beard was abundant, as it is now,\r\nwe found nearly half the flowering heads infested with _Ustilago\r\nreceptaculorum_, but for the past two or three years, although we have\r\nsought it industriously, not a single specimen could be found. It is\r\ncertain that plants found by Dickson, Bolton, and Sowerby, have not\r\nbeen detected since, whilst it is not improbable that species common\r\nwith us may be very rare fifty years hence. In this manner it would\r\nreally appear that fungi are much more liable than flowering plants to\r\nshift their localities, or increase and diminish in number.\r\n\r\nThe fleshy fungi, _Agaricini_ and _Boleti_ especially, are largely\r\ndependent upon the character of woods and forests. When the\r\nundergrowth of a wood is cleared away, as it often is every few years,\r\nit is easy to observe a considerable difference in the fungi. Species\r\nseem to change places, common ones amongst a dense undergrowth are\r\nrare or disappear with the copsewood, and others not observed before\r\ntake their place. Some species, too, are peculiar to certain woods,\r\nsuch as beech woods and fir woods, and their distribution will\r\nconsequently depend very much on the presence or absence of such\r\nwoods. Epiphytal species, such as _Agaricus ulmarius_, _Agaricus\r\nmucidus_, and a host of others, depend on circumstances which do not\r\ninfluence the distribution of flowering plants. It may be assumed that\r\nsuch species as flourish in pastures and open places are subject to\r\nfewer adverse conditions than those which affect woods and forests.\r\n\r\nAny one who has observed any locality with reference to its Mycologic\r\nFlora over a period of years will have been struck with the difference\r\nin number and variety caused by what may be termed a \"favourable\r\nseason,\" that is, plenty of moisture in August with warm weather\r\nafterwards. Although we know but little of the conditions of\r\ngermination in Agarics, it is but reasonable to suppose that a\r\nsuccession of dry seasons will considerably influence the flora of any\r\nlocality. Heat and humidity, therefore, are intimately concerned in\r\nthe mycologic vegetation of a country. Fries has noted in his essay\r\nthe features to which we have alluded. \"The fact,\" he says, \"must not\r\nbe lost sight of that some species of fungi which have formerly been\r\ncommon in certain localities may become, within our lifetime, more and\r\nmore scarce, and even altogether cease to grow there. The cause of\r\nthis, doubtless, is the occurrence of some change in the physical\r\nconstitution of a locality, such as that resulting from the\r\ndestruction of a forest, or from the drainage, by ditches and\r\ncuttings, of more or less extensive swamps, or from the cultivation of\r\nthe soil--all of them circumstances which cause the destruction of the\r\nprimitive fungaceous vegetation and the production of a new one. If we\r\ncompare the fungal flora of America with that of European countries,\r\nwe observe that the former equals, in its richness and the variety of\r\nits forms, that of the phanerogamous flora; it is probable, however,\r\nthat, in the lapse of more or fewer years, this richness will\r\ndecrease, in consequence of the extension of cultivation--as is\r\nillustrated, indeed, in what has already taken place in the more\r\nthickly peopled districts, as, for example, in the vicinity of New\r\nYork.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough heat and humidity influence all kinds of vegetation, yet heat\r\nseems to exert a less, and humidity a greater, influence on fungi than\r\non other plants. It is chiefly during the cool moist autumnal weather\r\nthat the fleshy fungi flourish most vigorously in our own country, and\r\nwe observe their number to increase with the humidity of the season.\r\nRain falls copiously in the United States, and this is one of the most\r\nfruitful countries known for the fleshy fungi. Hence it is a\r\nreasonable deduction that moisture is a condition favourable to the\r\ndevelopment of these plants. The _Myxogastres_, according to Dr. Henry\r\nCarter, are exceedingly abundant--in individuals, at least, if not in\r\nspecies--in Bombay, and this would lead to the conclusion that the\r\nmembers of this group are influenced as much by heat as humidity in\r\ntheir development, borne out by the more plentiful appearance of the\r\nspecies in this country in the warmer weather of summer.\r\n\r\nIn the essay to which we have alluded, Fries only attempts the\r\nrecognition of two zones in his estimate of the distribution of fungi,\r\nand these are the temperate and tropical. The frigid zone produces no\r\npeculiar types, and is poor in the number of species, whilst no\r\nessential distinction can be drawn between the tropical and\r\nsub-tropical with our present limited information. Even these two\r\nzones must not be accepted too rigidly, since tropical forms will in\r\nsome instances, and under favourable conditions, extend far upwards\r\ninto the temperate zone.\r\n\r\n\"In any region whatever,\" writes Fries, \"it is necessary, in the first\r\ninstance, to draw a distinction between its open naked plains and\r\nits wooded tracts. In the level open country there is a more rapid\r\nevaporation of the moisture by the conjoined action of the sun and\r\nwind; whence it happens that such a region is more bare of fungi\r\nthan one that is mountainous or covered by woods. On the other hand,\r\nplains possess several species peculiar to themselves; as, for\r\nexample, _Agaricus pediades_, certain _Tricholomata_, and, above\r\nall, the family _Coprini_, of which they may be regarded as the\r\nspecial habitat. The species of this family augment in number, in\r\nany given country, in proportion to the extent and degree of its\r\ncultivation; for instance, they grow more luxuriantly in the\r\nprovince of Scania, in Sweden--a district farther distinguished\r\nabove all others by its cultivation and fertility. In well-wooded\r\ncountries moisture is retained a much longer time, and, as a\r\nresult, the production of fungi is incomparably greater; and it is\r\nhere desirable to make a distinction between the fungi growing in\r\nforests of resinous-wooded trees (_Coniferæ_) and those which\r\ninhabit woods of other trees, for these two descriptions of forests\r\nmay be rightly regarded, as to their fungaceous growths, as two\r\ndifferent regions. Beneath the shade of _Coniferæ_, fungi are\r\nearlier in their appearance; so much so, that it often happens they\r\nhave attained their full development when their congeners in forests\r\nof non-resinous trees have scarcely commenced their growth. In woods\r\nof the latter sort, the fallen leaves, collected in thick layers, act\r\nas an obstacle to the soaking of moisture into the earth, and\r\nthereby retard the vegetation of fungi; on the other hand, such\r\nwoods retain moisture longer. These conditions afford to several\r\nlarge and remarkable species the necessary time for development. The\r\nbeech is characteristic of our own region, but, further north this\r\ntree gives place to the birch. Coniferous woods are, moreover,\r\ndivisible into two regions--that of the pines and that of the firs.\r\nThe latter is richer in species than the former, because, as is well\r\nknown, fir-trees flourish in more fertile and moister soils.\r\nWhether, with respect to the South of Europe, other subdivisions into\r\nregions are required, we know not; still less are we able to\r\ndecide on the like question in reference to the countries beyond\r\nEurope.\"[C]\r\n\r\nIn very cold countries the higher fungi are rare, whilst in tropical\r\ncountries they are most common at elevations which secure a temperate\r\nclimate. In Java, Junghuhn found them most prolific at an elevation of\r\n3,000 to 5,000 feet; and in India, Dr. Hooker remarked that they were\r\nmost abundant at an elevation of 7,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nFor the higher fungi we must be indebted to the summary made by Fries,\r\nto which we have little to add.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Agaricus_ occupies the first place, and surpasses, in the\r\nnumber of species, all the other generic groups known. It appears,\r\nfrom our present knowledge, that the _Agarici_ have their geographic\r\ncentre in the temperate zone, and especially in the colder portion of\r\nthat zone. It is a curious circumstance that all the extra-European\r\nspecies of this genus _Agaricus_ may be referred to various European\r\nsubgenera.\r\n\r\nIn tropical countries it appears that the _Agarici_ occupy only a\r\nsecondary position in relation to other genera of fungi, such as\r\n_Polyporus_, _Lenzites_, etc. North America, on the other hand, is\r\nricher in species of _Agaricus_ than Europe; for whilst the majority\r\nof typical forms are common to both continents, America further\r\npossesses many species peculiar to itself. In the temperate zone, so\r\nclose is the analogy prevailing between the various countries in\r\nrespect to the _Agaricini_, that from Sweden to Italy, and as well in\r\nEngland as North America, the same species are to be found. Of 500\r\n_Agaricini_ met with in St. Petersburg, there are only two or three\r\nwhich have not been discovered in Sweden; and again, of fifty species\r\nknown in Greenland, there is not one that is not common in Sweden. The\r\nsame remarks hold good in reference to the _Agaricini_ of Siberia,\r\nKamtschatka, the Ukraine, etc. The countries bordering upon the\r\nMediterranean possess, however, several peculiar types; and Eastern\r\nand Western Europe present certain dissimilarities in their Agaric\r\ninhabitants. Several species, for example, of _Armillaria_ and\r\n_Tricholoma_, which have been found in Russia, have been met with in\r\nSweden only in Upland, that is, in the most eastern province; all the\r\nspecies which belong to the so-called _abiegno-rupestres_ and\r\n_pineto-montanæ_ regions of Sweden are wanting in England; and it is\r\nonly in Scotland that the species of northern mountainous and\r\npine-bearing regions are met with--a circumstance explicable from the\r\nsimilarity in physical features between Sweden and the northern\r\nportions of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Coprinus_ appear to find suitable habitats in every\r\nquarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe _Cortinariæ_ predominate in the north; they abound in Northern\r\nlatitudes, especially on wooded hills; but the plains offer also some\r\npeculiar species which flourish during the rainy days of August and\r\nSeptember. In less cold countries they are more scarce or entirely\r\nabsent. The species of the genus _Hygrophorus_ would at first seem to\r\nhave a similar geographical distribution to those of the last group;\r\nbut this is really not the case, for the same _Hygrophori_ are to be\r\nfound in nearly every country of Europe, and even the hottest\r\ncountries (and those under the equator) are not destitute of\r\nrepresentatives of this wide-spread genus.\r\n\r\nThe _Lactarii_, which are so abundant in the forests of Europe and\r\nNorth America, appear to grow more and more scarce towards both the\r\nsouth and north. The same may be stated in regard to _Russula_.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Marasmius_ is dispersed throughout the globe, and\r\neverywhere presents numerous species. In inter-tropical countries they\r\nare still more abundant, and exhibit peculiarities in growth which\r\nprobably might justify their collection into a distinct group.\r\n\r\nThe genera _Lentinus_ and _Lenzites_ are found in every region of the\r\nworld; their principal centre, however, is in hot countries, where\r\nthey attain a splendid development. On the contrary, towards the north\r\nthey rapidly decrease in number.\r\n\r\nThe _Polypori_ constitute a group which, unlike that of the Agarics,\r\nespecially belongs to hot countries. The _Boleti_ constitute the only\r\nexception to this rule, since they select the temperate and frigid\r\nzones for their special abode, and some of them at times find their\r\nway to the higher regions of the Alps. No one can describe the\r\nluxuriance of the torrid zone in _Polypori_ and _Trametes_, genera of\r\n_Hymenomycetes_, which flourish beneath the shade of the virgin\r\nforests, where perpetual moisture and heat promote their vegetation\r\nand give rise to an infinite variety of forms. But though the genus\r\n_Polyporus_, which rivals _Agaricus_ in the number of its species,\r\ninhabits, in preference, warm climates at large, it nevertheless\r\nexhibits species peculiar to each country. This arises from the\r\ncircumstance that the _Polypori_, for the most part, live upon trees,\r\nand are dependent on this or that particular tree for a suitable\r\nhabitat; and the tropical flora being prolific in trees of all kinds,\r\na multitude of the most varied forms of these fungi is a necessary\r\nconsequence. _Hexagona_, _Favolus_, and _Laschia_ are common in\r\ninter-tropical countries, but they are either entirely absent or\r\nextremely rare in temperate climes.\r\n\r\nWhen the majority of the species of a genus are of a fleshy\r\nconsistence, it may generally be concluded that that genus belongs to\r\na Northern region, even if it should have some representatives in\r\nlands which enjoy more sunshine. Thus the _Hydna_ are the principal\r\nornaments of Northern forests, where they attain so luxuriant a growth\r\nand beauty that every other country must yield the palm to Sweden in\r\nrespect to them. In an allied genus, that of _Irpex_, the texture\r\nassumes a coriaceous consistence, and we find its species to be more\r\nespecially inhabitants of warm climates.\r\n\r\nMost of the genera of _Auricularini_ are cosmopolitan, and the same is\r\ntrue of some species of _Stereum_, of _Corticium_, etc., which are met\r\nwith in countries of the most different geographical position. In\r\ntropical countries, these genera of fungi assume the most curious and\r\nluxuriant forms. The single and not considerable genus _Cyphella_\r\nappears to be pretty uniformly distributed over the globe. The\r\n_Clavariæi_ are equally universal in their diffusion, although more\r\nplentiful in the north; however, the genus _Pterula_ possesses several\r\nexotic forms, though in Europe it has but two representative species.\r\nThat beautiful genus of _Hymenomycetes_, _Sparassis_, occupies a\r\nsimilar place next the _Clavariæi_, and is peculiarly a production of\r\nthe temperate zone and of the coniferous region.\r\n\r\nThe fungi which constitute the family of _Tremellini_ prevail in\r\nEurope, Asia, and North America, and exhibit no marked differences\r\namongst themselves, notwithstanding the distances of the several\r\ncountries apart. It must, however, be stated that the _Hirneolæ_ for\r\nthe most part inhabit the tropics.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the _Gasteromycetes_--an interesting family, which\r\nexhibits several ramifications or particular series of developments.\r\nThe most perfect _Gasteromycetes_ almost exclusively belong to the\r\nwarmer division of the temperate, and to the tropical zone, where\r\ntheir vegetation is the most luxuriant. Of late the catalogue of these\r\nfungi has been greatly enriched by the addition of numerous genera and\r\nspecies, proper to hot countries, previously unknown. Not uncommonly,\r\nthe exotic floras differ from ours, not merely in respect of the\r\nspecies, but also of the genera of _Gasteromycetes_. It must, besides,\r\nbe observed that this family is rich in well-defined genera, though\r\nvery poor in distinct specific forms. Among the genera found in\r\nEurope, many are cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nThe _Phalloidei_ present themselves in the torrid zone under the most\r\nvaried form and colouring, and comprise many genera rich in species.\r\nIn Europe their number is very restricted. As we advance northward\r\nthey decrease rapidly, so that the central districts of Sweden possess\r\nonly a single species, the _Phallus impudicus_, and even this solitary\r\nrepresentative of the family is very scarce. In Scania, the most\r\nsouthern province of Sweden, there is likewise but one genus and one\r\nspecies belonging to it, viz., the _Mutinus caninus_. Among other\r\nmembers of the _Phalloidei_, may be further mentioned the _Lysurus_ of\r\nChina, the _Aseröe_ of Van Diemen's Land, and the _Clathrus_, one\r\nspecies of which, _C. cancellatus_, has a very wide geographical\r\nrange; for instance, it is found in the south of Europe, in Germany,\r\nand in America; it occurs also in the south of England and the Isle of\r\nWight; whereas the other species of this genus have a very limited\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe _Tuberacei_[D] are remarkable amongst the fungi in being all of\r\nthem more or less hypogeous. They are natives of warm countries, and\r\nare distributed into numerous genera and species. The _Tuberacei_\r\nconstitute in Northern latitudes a group of fungi very poor in\r\nspecific forms. The few species of the _Hymenogastres_ belonging to\r\nSweden, with the exception of _Hyperrhiza variegata_ and one example\r\nof the genus _Octaviana_, are confined to the southern provinces. The\r\ngreater part of this group, like the _Lycoperdacei_, are met with in\r\nthe temperate zone. Most examples of the genus _Lycoperdon_ are\r\ncosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nThe _Nidulariacei_ and the _Trichodermacei_ appear to be scattered\r\nover the globe in a uniform manner, although their species are not\r\neverywhere similar. The same statement applies to the _Myxogastres_,\r\nwhich are common in Lapland, and appear to have their central point of\r\ndistribution in the countries within the temperate zone. At the same\r\ntime, they are not wanting in tropical regions, notwithstanding that\r\nthe intensity of heat, by drying up the mucilage which serves as the\r\nmedium for the development of their spores, is opposed to their\r\ndevelopment.[E]\r\n\r\nOf the _Coniomycetes_, the parasitic species, as the _Cæomacei_, the\r\n_Pucciniei_, and the _Ustilagines_, accompany their foster-plants into\r\nalmost all regions where they are found; so that smut, rust, and\r\nmildew are as common on wheat and barley in the Himalayas and in New\r\nZealand as in Europe and America. _Ravenelia_ and _Cronartium_ only\r\noccur in the warmer parts of the temperate zone, whilst _Sartvellia_\r\nis confined to Surinam. Species of _Podisoma_ and _Roestelia_ are as\r\ncommon in the United States as in Europe, and the latter appears also\r\nat the Cape and Ceylon. Wherever species of _Sphæria_ occur there the\r\n_Sphæronemei_ are found, but they do not appear, according to our\r\npresent knowledge, to be so plentiful in tropical as in temperate\r\ncountries. The _Torulacei_ and its allies are widely diffused, and\r\nprobably occur to a considerable extent in tropical countries.\r\n\r\n_Hyphomycetes_ are widely diffused; some species are peculiarly\r\ncosmopolitan, and all seem to be less influenced by climatic\r\nconditions than the more fleshy fungi. The _Sepedoniei_ are\r\nrepresented by at least one species wherever _Boletus_ is found. The\r\n_Mucedines_ occur everywhere in temperate and tropical regions,\r\n_Penicillium_ and _Aspergillus_ flourishing as much in the latter as\r\nin the former. _Botrytis_ and _Peronospora_ are almost as widely\r\ndiffused and as destructive in warmer as in temperate countries, and\r\nalthough from difficulty in preservation the moulds are seldom\r\nrepresented to any extent in collections, yet indications of their\r\npresence constantly occur in connection with other forms, to such an\r\nextent as to warrant the conclusion that they are far from uncommon.\r\nThe _Dematiei_ are probably equally as widely diffused. Species of\r\n_Helminthosporium_, _Cladosporium_, and _Macrosporium_ seem to be as\r\ncommon in tropical as temperate climes. The distribution of these\r\nfungi is imperfectly known, except in Europe and North America, but\r\ntheir occurrence in Ceylon, Cuba, India, and Australasia indicated a\r\ncosmopolitan range. _Cladosporium herbarum_ would seem to occur\r\neverywhere. The _Stilbacei_ and _Isariacei_ are not less widely\r\ndiffused, although as yet apparently limited in species. _Isaria_\r\noccurs on insects in Brazil as in North America, and species of\r\n_Stilbum_ and _Isaria_ are by no means rare in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe _Physomycetes_ have representatives in the tropics, species of\r\n_Mucor_ occurring in Cuba, Brazil, and the southern states of North\r\nAmerica, with the same and allied genera in Ceylon. _Antennaria_ and\r\n_Pisomyxa_ seem to reach their highest development in hot countries.\r\n\r\nThe _Ascomycetes_ are represented everywhere, and although certain\r\ngroups are more tropical than others, they are represented in all\r\ncollections. The fleshy forms are most prolific in temperate\r\ncountries, and only a few species of _Peziza_ affect the tropics, yet\r\nin elevated districts of hot countries, such as the Himalayas of\r\nIndia, _Peziza_, _Morchella_, and _Geoglossum_ are found. Two or three\r\nspecies of _Morchella_ are found in Kashmir, and at least one or two\r\nin Java, where they are used as food. The genus _Cyttaria_ is confined\r\nto the southern parts of South America and Tasmania. The United States\r\nequal if they do not exceed European states in the number of species\r\nof the _Discomycetes_. The _Phacidiacei_ are not confined to temperate\r\nregions, but are more rare elsewhere. _Cordierites_ and _Acroseyphus_\r\n(?) are tropical genera, the former extending upwards far into the\r\ntemperate zone, as _Hysterium_ and _Rhytisma_ descend into the\r\ntropics. Amongst the _Sphæriacei_, _Xylaria_ and _Hypoxylon_ are well\r\nrepresented in the tropics, such species as _Xylaria hypoxylon_ and\r\n_Xylaria corniformis_ being widely diffused. In West Africa an\r\nAmerican species of _Hypoxylon_ is amongst the very few specimens that\r\nhave ever reached us from the Congo, whilst _H. concentricum_ and\r\n_Ustulina vulgaris_ seem to be almost cosmopolitan. _Torrubia_ and\r\n_Nectria_ extend into the tropics, but are more plentiful in temperate\r\nand sub-tropical countries. _Dothidea_ is well represented in the\r\ntropics, whilst of the species of _Sphæria_ proper, only the more\r\nprominent have probably been secured by collectors; hence the\r\n_Superficiales_ section is better represented than the _Obtectæ_, and\r\nthe tropical representatives of foliicolous species are but few.\r\n_Asterina_, _Micropeltis_, and _Pemphidium_ are more sub-tropical than\r\ntemperate forms. The _Perisporiacei_ are represented almost\r\neverywhere; although species of _Erysiphe_ are confined to temperate\r\nregions, the genus _Meliola_ occupies its place in warmer climes.\r\nFinally, the _Tuberacei_, which are subterranean in their habits, are\r\nlimited in distribution, being confined to the temperate zone, never\r\nextending far into the cold, and but poorly represented out of Europe.\r\nOne species of _Mylitta_ occurs in Australia, another in China, and\r\nanother in the Neilgherries of India; the genus _Paurocotylis_ is\r\nfound in New Zealand and Ceylon. It is said that a species of _Tuber_\r\nis found in Himalayan regions, but in the United States, as well as in\r\nNorthern Europe, the _Tuberacei_ are rare.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect condition of our information concerning very many\r\ncountries, even of those partially explored, must render any estimate\r\nor comparison of the floras of those countries most fragmentary and\r\nimperfect. Recently, the mycology of our own islands has been more\r\nclosely investigated, and the result of many years' application on the\r\npart of a few individuals has appeared in a record of some 2,809\r\nspecies,[F] to which subsequent additions have been made, to an extent\r\nof probably not much less than 200 species,[G] which would bring the\r\ntotal to about 3,000 species. The result is that no material\r\ndifference exists between our flora and that of Northern France,\r\nBelgium, and Scandinavia, except that in the latter there are a larger\r\nnumber of Hymenomycetal forms. The latest estimates of the flora of\r\nScandinavia are contained in the works of the illustrious Fries,[H]\r\nbut these are not sufficiently recent, except so far as regards the\r\n_Hymenomycetes_, for comparison of numbers with British species.\r\n\r\nThe flora of Belgium has its most recent exponent in the posthumous\r\nwork of Jean Kickx; but the 1,370 species enumerated by him can hardly\r\nbe supposed to represent the whole of the fungi of Belgium, for in\r\nsuch case it would be less than half the number found in the British\r\nIslands, although the majority of genera and species are the same.[I]\r\n\r\nFor the North of France no one could have furnished a more complete\r\nlist, especially of the microscopic forms, than M. Desmazières, but we\r\nare left to rely solely upon his papers in \"Annales des Sc. Nat.\" and\r\nhis published specimens, which, though by no means representative of\r\nthe fleshy fungi, are doubtless tolerably exhaustive of the minute\r\nspecies. From what we know of French _Hymenomycetes_, their number and\r\nvariety appear to be much below those of Great Britain.[J]\r\n\r\nThe mycologic flora of Switzerland has been very well investigated,\r\nalthough requiring revision. Less attention having been given to the\r\nminute forms, and more to the _Hymenomycetes_ than in France and\r\nBelgium, may in part account for the larger proportion of the latter\r\nin the Swiss flora.[K]\r\n\r\nIn Spain and Portugal scarce anything has been done; the small\r\ncollection made by Welwitsch can in no way be supposed to represent\r\nthe Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe fungi of Italy[L] include some species peculiar to the Peninsula.\r\nThe _Tuberacei_ are well represented, and although the _Hymenomycetes_\r\ndo not equal in number those of Britain or Scandinavia, a good\r\nproportion is maintained.\r\n\r\nBavaria and Austria (including Hungary, and the Tyrol) are being more\r\nthoroughly investigated than hitherto, but the works of Schæffer,\r\nTratinnick, Corda, and Krombholz have made us acquainted with the\r\ngeneral features of their mycology,[M] to which more recent lists and\r\ncatalogues have contributed.[N] The publication of dried specimens has\r\nof late years greatly facilitated acquaintance with the fungi of\r\ndifferent countries in Europe, and those issued by Baron Thümen from\r\nAustria do not differ materially from those of Northern Germany,\r\nalthough Dr. Rehm has made us acquainted with some new and interesting\r\nforms from Bavaria.[O]\r\n\r\nRussia is to a large extent unknown, except in its northern\r\nborders.[P] Karsten has investigated the fungi of Finland,[Q] and\r\nadded considerably to the number of _Discomycetes_, for which the\r\nclimate seems to be favourable; but, as a whole, it may be concluded\r\nthat Western and Northern Europe are much better explored than the\r\nEastern and South-Eastern, to which we might add the South, if Italy\r\nbe excepted.\r\n\r\nWe have only to add, for Europe, that different portions of the German\r\nempire have been well worked, from the period of Wallroth to the\r\npresent.[R] Recently, the valley of the Rhine has been exhaustively\r\nexamined by Fuckel;[S] but both Germany and France suffered checks\r\nduring the late war which made their mark on the records of science\r\nnot so speedily to be effaced. Denmark, with its splendid Flora Danica\r\nstill in progress, more than a century after its commencement,[T] has\r\na mycologic flora very like to that of Scandinavia, which is as well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nIf we pass from Europe to North America, we find there a mycologic\r\nflora greatly resembling that of Europe, and although Canada and the\r\nextreme North is little known, some parts of the United States have\r\nbeen investigated. Schweinitz[U] first made known to any extent the\r\nriches of this country, especially Carolina, and in this state the\r\nlate Dr. Curtis and H. W. Ravenel continued their labours. With the\r\nexception of Lea's collections in Cincinnati, Wright's in Texas, and\r\nsome contributions from Ohio, Alabama, Massachusetts, and New York, a\r\ngreat portion of this vast country is mycologically unknown. It is\r\nremarkably rich in fleshy fungi, not only in _Agaricini_, but also in\r\n_Discomycetes_, containing a large number of European forms, mostly\r\nEuropean genera, with many species at present peculiar to itself.\r\nTropical forms extend upwards into the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe islands of the West Indies have been more or less examined, but\r\nnone so thoroughly as Cuba, at first by Ramon de la Sagra, and\r\nafterwards by Wright.[V] The three principal genera of _Hymenomycetes_\r\nrepresented are _Agaricus_, _Marasmius_, and _Polyporus_, represented\r\nseverally by 82, 51, and 120 species, amounting to more than half the\r\nentire number. Of the 490 species, about 57 per cent. are peculiar to\r\nthe island; 13 per cent. are widely dispersed species; 12 per cent.\r\nare common to the island and Central America, together with the warmer\r\nparts of South America and Mexico; 3 per cent. are common to it with\r\nthe United States, especially the Southern; while 13 per cent. are\r\nEuropean species, including, however, 13 which may be considered as\r\ncosmopolitan. Some common tropical species do not occur, and, on the\r\nwhole, the general character seems sub-tropical rather than tropical.\r\nMany of the species are decidedly those of temperate regions, or at\r\nleast nearly allied. Perhaps the most interesting species are those\r\nwhich occur in the genera _Craterellus_ and _Laschia_, the latter\r\ngenus, especially, yielding several new forms. The fact that the\r\nclimate is, on the whole, more temperate than that of some other\r\nislands in the same latitudes, would lead us to expect the presence of\r\na comparatively large number of European species, or those which are\r\nfound in the more northern United States, or British North America,\r\nand may account for the fact that so small a proportion of species\r\nshould be identical with those from neighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nIn Central America only a few small collections have been made, which\r\nindicate a sub-tropical region.\r\n\r\nFrom the northern parts of South America, M. Leprieur collected in\r\nFrench Guiana.[W] Southwards of this, Spruce collected in the\r\ncountries bordering on the River Amazon, and Gardner in Brazil,[X]\r\nGaudichaud in Chili and Peru,[Y] Gay in Chili,[Z] Blanchet in\r\nBahia,[a] Weddell in Brazil,[b] and Auguste de Saint Hiliare[c] in\r\nthe same country. Small collections have also been made in the\r\nextreme south. All these collections contain coriaceous species of\r\n_Polyporus_, _Favolus_, and allied genera, with _Auricularini_,\r\ntogether with such _Ascomycetes_ as _Xylaria_, and such forms of\r\n_Peziza_ as _P. tricholoma_, _P. Hindsii_, and _P. macrotis_. As\r\nyet we cannot form an estimate of the extent or variety of the\r\nSouth American flora, which has furnished the interesting genus\r\n_Cyttaria_, and may yet supply forms unrecognized elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe island of Juan Fernandez furnished to M. Bertero a good\r\nrepresentative collection,[d] which is remarkable as containing more\r\nthan one-half its number of European species, and the rest possessing\r\nrather the character of those of a temperate than a sub-tropical\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nAustralasia has been partly explored, and the results embodied in the\r\nFloras of Dr. Hooker and subsequent communications. In a note to an\r\nenumeration of 235 species in 1872, the writer observes that \"many of\r\nthem are either identical with European species, or so nearly allied\r\nthat with dried specimens only, unaccompanied by notes or drawings, it\r\nis impossible to separate them; others are species which are almost\r\nuniversally found in tropical or sub-tropical countries, while a few\r\nonly are peculiar to Australia, or are undescribed species, mostly of\r\na tropical type. The collections on the whole can scarcely be said to\r\nbe of any great interest, except so far as geographical distribution\r\nis concerned, as the aberrant forms are few.\"[e]\r\n\r\nThe fungi collected by the Antarctic Expedition in Auckland and\r\nCampbell's Islands, and in Fuegia and the Falklands,[f] were few and\r\nof but little interest, including such cosmopolitan forms as _Sphæria\r\nherbarum_ and _Cladosporium herbarum_, _Hirneola auricula-judæ_,\r\n_Polyporus versicolor_, _Eurotium herbariorum_, etc.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand a large proportion have been found, and these may be\r\ntaken to represent the general character of the fungi of the islands,\r\nwhich is of the type usually found in temperate regions.[g]\r\n\r\nThe fungi of Asia are so little known that no satisfactory conclusions\r\ncan be drawn from our present incomplete knowledge. In India, the\r\ncollections made by Dr. Hooker in his progress to the Sikkim\r\nHimalayas,[h] a few species obtained by M. Perottet in Pondicherry,\r\nand small collections from the Neilgherries,[i] are almost all that\r\nhave been recorded. From these it may be concluded that elevations\r\nsuch as approximate a temperate climate are the most productive, and\r\nhere European and North American genera, with closely allied species,\r\nhave the preponderance. The number of _Agaricini_, for instance, is\r\nlarge, and amongst the twenty-eight subgenera into which the genus\r\n_Agaricus_ is divided, eight only are unrepresented. Casual specimens\r\nreceived from other parts of India afford evidence that here is a vast\r\nfield unexplored, the forests and mountain slopes of which would\r\ndoubtless afford an immense number of new and interesting forms.\r\n\r\nOf the Indian Archipelago, Java has been most explored, both by\r\nJunghuhn[j] and Zollinger.[k] The former records 117 species in 40\r\ngenera, Nees von Esenbeck and Blume 11 species in 3 genera, and\r\nZollinger and Moritzi 31 species in 20 genera, making a total of 159\r\nspecies, of which 47 belong to _Polyporus_. Léveillé added 87\r\nspecies, making a total of 246 species. The fungi of Sumatra, Borneo,\r\nand other islands are partly the same and partly allied, but of a\r\nsimilar tropical character.\r\n\r\nThe fungi of the island of Ceylon, collected by Gardner, Thwaites, and\r\nKönig, were numerous. The Agarics comprise 302 species, closely\r\nresembling those of our own country.[l] It is singular that every one\r\nof the subgenera of Fries is represented, though the number of species\r\nin one or two is greatly predominant. _Lepiota_ and _Psalliota_ alone\r\ncomprise one-third of the species, while _Pholiota_ offers only a\r\nsingle obscure species. The enumeration recently published of the\r\nsucceeding families contains many species of interest.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the best explored country is Algeria, although unfortunately\r\nthe flora was never completed.[m] The correspondence between the\r\nfungi of Algeria and European countries is very striking, and the\r\nimpression is not removed by the presence of a few sub-tropical forms.\r\nIt is probable that were the fungi of Spain known the resemblance would\r\nbe more complete.\r\n\r\nFrom the Cape of Good Hope and Natal collections have been made by\r\nZeyher,[n] Drége, and others, and from these we are enabled to form a\r\ntolerable estimate of the mycologic flora. Of the _Hymenomycetes_, the\r\ngreater part belong to _Agaricus_: there are but four or five\r\n_Polypori_ in Zeyher's collection, one of which is protean. The\r\n_Gasteromycetes_ are interesting, belonging to many genera, and\r\npresenting two, _Scoleciocarpus_ and _Phellorinia_, which were founded\r\nupon specimens in this collection. _Batarrea_, _Tulostoma_, and\r\n_Mycenastrum_ are represented by European species. There are also two\r\nspecies of _Lycoperdon_, and one of _Podaxon_. Besides these, there is\r\nthe curious _Secotium Gueinzii_. The genus _Geaster_ does not appear\r\nin the collection, nor _Scleroderma_. Altogether the Cape flora is a\r\npeculiar one, and can scarcely be compared with any other.\r\n\r\nAt the most, only scattered and isolated specimens have been recorded\r\nfrom Senegal, from Egypt, or from other parts of Africa, so that, with\r\nthe above exceptions, the continent may be regarded as unknown.\r\n\r\nFrom this imperfect summary it will be seen that no general scheme of\r\ngeographical distribution of fungi can as yet be attempted, and the\r\nmost we can hope to do is to compare collection with collection, and\r\nwhat we know of one country with what we know of another, and note\r\ndifferences and agreements, so as to estimate the probable character\r\nof the fungi of other countries of which we are still in ignorance. It\r\nis well sometimes that we should attempt a task like the present,\r\nsince we then learn how much there is to be known, and how much good\r\nwork lies waiting to be done by the capable and willing hands that may\r\nhereafter undertake it.\r\n\r\n   [A] Mr. E.

Although it may be said that no time, except when\r\nthe ground is covered with snow, is entirely barren of fungi, yet\r\nthere are periods more prolific than others.[A] Fleshy fungi, such as\r\nthe _Hymenomycetes_, are most common from September until the frosts\r\nset in, whereas many microscopic species may be found in early spring,\r\nand increase in number until the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe collector may be provided with an ordinary collecting box, but\r\nfor the Agarics an open shallow basket is preferable. A great number\r\nof the woody kinds may be carried in the coat-pocket, and foliicolous\r\nspecies placed between the leaves of a pocket-book. It is a good\r\nplan to be provided with a quantity of soft bibulous paper, in\r\nwhich specimens can be wrapped when collected, and this will\r\nmaterially assist in their preservation when transferred to box or\r\nbasket. A large clasp-knife, a small pocket-saw, and a pocket-lens\r\nwill complete the outfit for ordinary occasions. In order to\r\npreserve the fleshy fungi for the herbarium, there is but one\r\nmethod, which has often been described. The Agaric, or other\r\nsimilar fungus, is cut perpendicularly from the pileus downwards\r\nthrough the stem. A second cut in the same direction removes a thin\r\nslice, which represents a section of the fungus; this may be laid\r\non blotting paper, or plant-drying paper, and put under slight\r\npressure to dry. From one-half of the fungus the pileus is removed,\r\nand with a sharp knife the gills and fleshy portion of the pileus\r\nare cut away. In the same manner the inner flesh of the half stem is\r\nalso cleared. When dried, the half of the pileus is placed in its\r\nnatural position on the top of the half stem, and thus a portrait of\r\nthe growing fungus is secured, whilst the section shows the\r\narrangement of the hymenium and the character of the stem. The\r\nother half of the pileus may be placed, gills downward, on a piece\r\nof black paper, and allowed to rest there during the night. In the\r\nmorning the spores will have been thrown down upon the paper,\r\nwhich may be placed with the other portions. When dry, the section,\r\nprofile, and spore paper may be mounted together on a piece of stiff\r\npaper, and the name, locality, and date inscribed below, with any\r\nadditional particulars. It is advisable here to caution the collector\r\nnever to omit writing down these particulars at once when the\r\npreparations are made, and to place them together, between the\r\nfolds of the drying paper, in order to prevent the possibility of a\r\nmistake. Some small species may be dried whole or only cut down the\r\ncentre, but the spores should never be forgotten. When dried, either\r\nbefore or after mounting, the specimens should be poisoned, in\r\norder to preserve them from the attacks of insects. The best medium\r\nfor this purpose is carbolic acid, laid on with a small hog-hair\r\nbrush. Whatever substance is used, it must not be forgotten by the\r\nmanipulator that he is dealing with poison, and must exercise\r\ncaution. If the specimens are afterwards found to be insufficiently\r\npoisoned, or that minute insects are present in the herbarium, fresh\r\npoisoning will be necessary. Some think that benzine or spirits of\r\ncamphor is sufficient, but as either is volatile, it is not to be\r\ntrusted as a permanent preservative. Mr. English, of Epping, by an\r\ningenious method of his own, preserves a great number of the fleshy\r\nspecies in their natural position, and although valueless for an\r\nherbarium, they are not only very ornamental, but useful, if space\r\ncan be devoted to them.\r\n\r\nLeaf parasites, whether on living or dead leaves, may be dried in the\r\nusual way for drying plants, between folds of bibulous paper under\r\npressure. It may be sometimes necessary with dead leaves to throw them\r\nin water, in order that they may be flattened without breaking, and\r\nthen dry them in the same manner as green leaves. All species produced\r\non a hard matrix, as wood, bark, etc., should have as much as possible\r\nof the matrix pared away, so that the specimens may lie flat in the\r\nherbarium. This is often facilitated in corticolous species by\r\nremoving the bark and drying it under pressure.\r\n\r\nThe dusty _Gasteromycetes_ are troublesome, especially the minute\r\nspecies, and if mounted openly on paper are soon spoiled. A good plan\r\nis to provide small square or round cardboard boxes, of not more than\r\na quarter of an inch in depth, and to glue the specimen to the bottom\r\nat once, allowing it to dry in that position before replacing the\r\ncover. The same method should be adopted for many of the moulds, such\r\nas _Polyactis_, etc., which, under any circumstances, are difficult to\r\npreserve.\r\n\r\nIn collecting moulds, we have found it an excellent plan to go out\r\nprovided with small wooden boxes, corked at top and bottom, such as\r\nentomologists use, and some common pins. When a delicate mould is\r\ncollected on a decayed Agaric, or any other matrix, after clearing\r\naway with a penknife all unnecessary portions of the matrix, the\r\nspecimen may be pinned down to the cork in one of these boxes. Another\r\nmethod, and one advisable also for the _Myxogastres_, is to carry two\r\nor three pill-boxes, in which, after being wrapped in tissue paper,\r\nthe specimen may be placed.\r\n\r\nA great difficulty is often experienced with microscopic fungi, such,\r\nfor instance, as the _Sphæriacei_, in the necessity, whenever a new\r\nexamination is required, to soak the specimen for some hours, and then\r\ntransfer the fruit to a slide, before it can be compared with any\r\nnewly-found specimen that has to be identified. To avoid this, mounted\r\nspecimens ready for the microscope are an acquisition, and may be\r\nsecured in the following manner. After the fungus has been soaked in\r\nwater, where that is necessary, and the hymenium extracted on the\r\npoint of a penknife, let it be transferred to the centre of a clean\r\nglass slide. A drop of glycerine is let fall upon this nucleus, then\r\nthe covering glass placed over it. A slight pressure will flatten the\r\nobject and expel all the superfluous glycerine around the edges of the\r\ncovering glass. A spring clip holds the cover in position, whilst a\r\ncamel-hair pencil is used to remove the glycerine which may have been\r\nexpelled. This done, the edges of the cover may be fixed to the slide\r\nby painting round with gum-dammar dissolved in benzole. In from twelve\r\nto twenty-four hours the spring clip may be removed, and the mount\r\nplaced in the cabinet. Glycerine is, perhaps, the best medium for\r\nmounting the majority of these objects, and when dammar and benzole\r\nare used for fixing, there is no difficulty experienced, as is the\r\ncase with Canada balsam, if the superfluous glycerine is not wholly\r\nwashed away. Specimens of _Puccinia_ mounted in this way when fresh\r\ngathered, and before any shrivelling had taken place, are as plump and\r\nnatural in our cabinet as they were when collected six or seven years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nMoulds are always troublesome to preserve in a herbarium in a state\r\nsufficiently perfect for reference after a few years. We have found it\r\nan excellent method to provide some thin plates of mica, the thinner\r\nthe better, of a uniform size, say two inches square, or even less.\r\nBetween two of these plates of mica enclose a fragment of the mould,\r\ntaking care not to move one plate over the other after the mould is\r\nplaced. Fix the plates by a clip, whilst strips of paper are gummed or\r\npasted over the edges of the mica plates so as to hold them together.\r\nWhen dry, the clip may be removed, and the name written on the paper.\r\nThese mounts may be put each in a small envelope, and fastened down in\r\nthe herbarium. Whenever an examination is required, the object, being\r\nalready dry-mounted, may at once be placed under the microscope. In\r\nthis manner the mode of attachment of the spores can be seen, but if\r\nmounted in fluid they are at once detached; and if the moulds are only\r\npreserved in boxes, in the course of a short time nearly every spore\r\nwill have fallen from its support.\r\n\r\nTwo or three accessories to a good herbarium may be named. For fleshy\r\nfungi, especially Agarics, faithfully coloured drawings, side by side\r\nwith the dried specimens, will compensate for loss or change of colour\r\nwhich most species undergo in the process of drying. For minute\r\nspecies, camera lucida drawings of the spores, together with their\r\nmeasurements, will add greatly to the practical value of a collection.\r\nIn mounting specimens, whether on leaves, bark, or wood, it will be of\r\nadvantage to have one specimen glued down to the paper so as to be\r\nseen at once, and a duplicate loose in a small envelope beside it, so\r\nthat the latter may at any time be removed and examined under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nIn arranging specimens for the herbarium, a diversity of taste and\r\nopinion exists as to the best size for the herbarium paper. It is\r\ngenerally admitted that a small size is preferable to the large one\r\nusually employed for phanerogamous plants. Probably the size of\r\nfoolscap is the most convenient, each sheet being confined to a single\r\nspecies. In public herbaria, the advantage of a uniform size for all\r\nplants supersedes all other advantages, but in a private herbarium,\r\nconsisting entirely of fungi, the smaller size is better.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic examination of minute species is an absolute necessity\r\nto ensure accurate identification. Little special remark is called for\r\nhere, since the methods adopted for other objects will be available.\r\nSpecimens which have become dry may be placed in water previous to\r\nexamination, a process which will be found essential in such genera as\r\n_Peziza_, _Sphæria_, etc. For moulds, which must be examined as opaque\r\nobjects, if all their beauties and peculiarities are to be made out, a\r\nhalf-inch objective is recommended, with the nozzle bevelled as much\r\nto a point as possible, so that no light be obstructed.[B]\r\n\r\nIn examining the sporidia of minute _Pezizæ_ and some others, the aid\r\nof some reagent will be found necessary. When the sporidia are very\r\ndelicate and hyaline, the septa cannot readily be seen if present; to\r\naid in the examination, a drop of tincture of iodine will be of\r\nconsiderable advantage. In many cases sporidia, which are very\r\nindistinct in glycerine, are much more distinct when the fluid is\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe following hints to travellers, as regards the collection of fungi,\r\ndrawn up some years since by the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, have been widely\r\ncirculated, and may be usefully inserted here, though at the risk of\r\nrepetition:--\r\n\r\n\"It is frequently complained that in collections of exotic plants, no\r\ntribe is so much neglected as that of fungi; this arises partly from\r\nthe supposed difficulty of preserving good specimens, partly from\r\ntheir being less generally studied than other vegetable productions.\r\nAs, however, in no department of botany, there is a greater\r\nprobability of meeting with new forms, and the difficulties, though\r\nconfessedly great in one or two genera, are far less than is often\r\nimagined, the following hints are respectfully submitted to such\r\ncollectors as may desire to neglect no part of the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"The greater proportion, especially of tropical fungi, are dried,\r\nsimply by light pressure, with as much ease as phoenogamous plants;\r\nindeed, a single change of the paper in which they are placed is\r\ngenerally sufficient, and many, if wrapped up in soft paper when\r\ngathered, and submitted to light pressure, require no further\r\nattention. Such as are of a tough leathery nature, if the paper be\r\nchanged a few hours after the specimens have been laid in, preserve\r\nall their characters admirably; and if in the course of a few weeks\r\nthere is an opportunity of washing them with a solution of turpentine\r\nand corrosive sublimate, submitting them again to pressure for a few\r\nhours merely to prevent their shrinking, there will be no fear of\r\ntheir suffering from the attacks of insects.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the mushroom tribe are so soft and watery that it is very\r\ndifficult to make good specimens without a degree of labour which is\r\nquite out of the question with travellers. By changing, however, the\r\npapers in which they are dried two or three times the first day, if\r\npracticable, useful specimens may be prepared, especially if a few\r\nnotes be made as to colour, etc. The more important notes are as to\r\nthe colour of the stem and pileus, together with any peculiarities of\r\nthe surface, _e.g._, whether it be dry, viscid, downy, scaly, etc.,\r\nand whether the flesh of the pileus be thin or otherwise; as to the\r\nstem, whether hollow or solid; as to the gills, whether they are\r\nattached to the stem or free; and especially what is their colour and\r\nthat of the spores. It is not in general expedient to preserve\r\nspecimens in spirits, except others are dried by pressure, or copious\r\nnotes be made; except, indeed, in some fungi of a gelatinous nature,\r\nwhich can scarcely be dried at all by pressure.\r\n\r\n\"The large woody fungi, the puff-balls, and a great number of those\r\nwhich grow on wood, etc., are best preserved, after ascertaining that\r\nthey are dry and free from larvæ, by simply wrapping them in paper or\r\nplacing them in chip-boxes, taking care that they are so closely\r\npacked as not to rub. As in other tribes of plants, it is very\r\nrequisite to have specimens in different stages of growth, and notes\r\nas to precise habitats are always interesting.\r\n\r\n\"The attention of the traveller can scarcely be directed to any more\r\ninteresting branch, or one more likely to produce novelty, than the\r\npuff-ball tribe; and he is particularly requested to collect these in\r\nevery stage of growth, especially in the earliest, and, if possible,\r\nto preserve some of the younger specimens in spirits. One or two\r\nspecies are produced on ant-hills, the knowledge of the early state of\r\nwhich is very desirable.\r\n\r\n\"The fungi which grow on leaves in tropical climates are scarcely less\r\nabundant than in our own country, though belonging to a different\r\ntype. Many of these must constantly come under the eye of the\r\ncollector of phoenogams, and would be most acceptable to the\r\nmycologist. But the attention of the collector should also be directed\r\nto the lichen-like fungi, which are so abundant in some countries on\r\nfallen sticks. Hundreds of species of the utmost interest would reward\r\nactive research, and they are amongst the easiest to dry; indeed, in\r\ntropical countries, the greater proportion of the species are easy to\r\npreserve, but they will not strike the eye which is not on the watch\r\nfor them. The number of fleshy species is but few, and far less\r\nlikely to furnish novelty.\"\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may urge upon all those who have followed us thus\r\nfar to adopt this branch of botany as their speciality. Hitherto\r\nit has been very much neglected, and a wide field is open for\r\ninvestigation and research. The life-history of the majority of\r\nspecies has still to be read, and the prospects of new discoveries\r\nfor the industrious and persevering student are great. All who have as\r\nyet devoted themselves with assiduity have been in this manner\r\nrewarded. The objects are easily obtainable, and there is a constantly\r\nincreasing infatuation in the study. Where so much is unknown, not a\r\nfew difficulties have to be encountered, and here the race is not to\r\nthe swift so much as to the untiring. May our efforts to supply this\r\nintroduction to the study receive their most welcome reward in an\r\naccession to the number of the students and investigators of the\r\nnature, uses, and influences of fungi.\r\n\r\n   [A] The genus _Chionyphe_ occurs on granaries under snow, as well as\r\n       in that formidable disease, the Madura fungus-foot.

Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\n\"If the 'International Scientific Series' proceeds as it has begun, it\r\nwill more than fulfil the promise given to the reading public in its\r\nprospectus. The first volume, by Professor Tyndall, was a model of\r\nlucid and attractive scientific exposition; and now we have a second,\r\nby Mr. Walter Bagehot, which is not only very lucid and charming, but\r\nalso original and suggestive in the highest degree. Nowhere since the\r\npublication of Sir Henry Maine's 'Ancient Law,' have we seen so many\r\nfruitful thoughts suggested in the course of a couple of hundred\r\npages.... To do justice to Mr. Bagehot's fertile book, would require a\r\nlong article. With the best of intentions, we are conscious of having\r\ngiven but a sorry account of it in these brief paragraphs.

We refrain from\r\ngiving a fuller account of these suggestive essays, only because we\r\nare sure that our readers will find it worth their while to\r\nperuse the book for themselves; and we sincerely hope that the\r\nforthcoming parts of the 'International Scientific Series' will be\r\nas interesting.\"--_Athenæum_.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bagehot discusses an immense variety of topics connected with the\r\nprogress of societies and nations, and the development of their\r\ndistinctive peculiarities; and his book shows an abundance of\r\ningenious and original thought.\"--ALFRED RUSSELL WALLACE, in\r\n_Nature_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFoods.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. EDWARD SMITH.\r\n\r\n 1 vol., 12mo.  Cloth Illustrated.                     Price, $1.75.\r\n\r\nIn making up THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC SERIES, Dr Edward Smith was\r\nselected as the ablest man in England to treat the important subject\r\nof Foods. His services were secured for the undertaking, and the\r\nlittle treatise he has produced shows that the choice of a writer on\r\nthis subject was most fortunate, as the book is unquestionably the\r\nclearest and best-digested compend of the Science of Foods that has\r\nappeared in our language.\r\n\r\n  \"The book contains a series of diagrams, displaying the effects\r\n  of sleep and meals on pulsation and respiration, and of various\r\n  kinds of food on respiration, which, as the results of Dr\r\n  Smith's own experiments, possess a very high value. We have\r\n  not far to go in this work for occasions of favorable criticism;\r\n  they occur throughout, but are perhaps most apparent in those\r\n  parts of the subject with which Dr. Smith's name is especially\r\n  linked.\"--_London Examiner._\r\n\r\n  \"The union of scientific and popular treatment in the composition\r\n  of this work will afford an attraction to many readers who would\r\n  have been indifferent to purely theoretical details.... Still his\r\n  work abounds in information, much of which is of great value, and\r\n  a part of which could not easily be obtained from other sources.\r\n  Its interest is decidedly enhanced for students who demand both\r\n  clearness and exactness of statement, by the profusion of well\r\n  executed woodcuts, diagrams, and tables, which accompany the\r\n  volume.... The suggestions of the author on the use of tea and\r\n  coffee, and of the various forms of alcohol, although perhaps not\r\n  strictly of a novel character, are highly instructive, and form an\r\n  interesting portion of the volume.\"--_N.

Prof. Bain's own theory of the connection between the\r\n  mental and the bodily part in man is stated by himself to be as\r\n  follows: There is 'one substance, with two sets of properties,\r\n  two sides, the physical and the mental--a _double-faced unity_.'\r\n  While, in the strongest manner, asserting the union of mind\r\n  with brain, he yet denies 'the association of union _in place_,'\r\n  but asserts the union of close succession in time,' holding that\r\n  'the same being is, by alternate fits, under extended and under\r\n  unextended consciousness.'\"--_Christian Register._\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe Study of Sociology.\r\n\r\nBy HERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n 1 vol.,      12mo.

It is a difficult task to give the\r\noutlines of a complete theory of law in a portable volume, which he\r\nwho runs may read, and probably Professor Amos himself would be the\r\nlast to claim that he has perfectly succeeded in doing this. But he\r\nhas certainly done much to clear the science of law from the technical\r\nobscurities which darken it to minds which have had no legal training,\r\nand to make clear to his 'lay' readers in how true and high a sense it\r\ncan assert its right to be considered a science, and not a mere\r\npractice.\"--_The Christian Register._\r\n\r\n\"The works of Bentham and Austin are abstruse and philosophical,\r\nand Maine's require hard study and a certain amount of special\r\ntraining.

It was left to Amos to gather up the result\r\nand present the science in its fullness. The unquestionable merits of\r\nthis, his last book, are, that it contains a complete treatment of\r\na subject which has hitherto been handled by specialists, and it\r\nopens up that subject to every inquiring mind.... To do justice to\r\n'The Science of Law' would require a longer review than we have\r\nspace for. We have read no more interesting and instructive book for\r\nsome time. Its themes concern every one who renders obedience to laws,\r\nand who would have those laws the best possible. The tide of legal\r\nreform which set in fifty years ago has to sweep yet higher if the\r\nflaws in our jurisprudence are to be removed.

It treats of the functions of the human body from a\r\npractical point of view, and is enriched by many original experiments\r\nand observations by the author. Considerable space is given to\r\nphysiological anatomy, particularly the structure of glandular organs,\r\nthe digestive system, nervous system, blood-vessels, organs of special\r\nsense, and organs of generation. It not only considers the various\r\nfunctions of the body, from an experimental stand-point, but is\r\npeculiarly rich in citations of the literature of physiology. It is\r\ntherefore invaluable as a work of reference for those who wish to\r\nstudy the subject of physiology exhaustively. As a complete treatise\r\non a subject of such interest, it should be in the libraries of\r\nliterary and scientific men, as well as in the hands of practitioners\r\nand students of medicine.

Price_,\r\n$2.00.\r\n\r\n  \"The book, indeed, is more comprehensive than its title implies.\r\n  Purporting to tell the life of the Prince Consort, it includes a\r\n  scarcely less minute biography--which may be regarded as almost an\r\n  autobiography--of the Queen herself; and, when it is complete, it\r\n  will probably present a more minute history of the domestic life\r\n  of a queen and her 'master' (the term is Her Majesty's) than has\r\n  ever before appeared.\"--_From the Athenæeum._\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Martin has accomplished his task with a success which could\r\n  scarcely have been anticipated. His biography of Prince Albert\r\n  would be valuable and instructive even if it were addressed to\r\n  remote and indifferent readers who had no special interest in the\r\n  English court or in the royal family. Prince Albert's actual\r\n  celebrity is inseparably associated with the high position which\r\n  he occupied, but his claim to permanent reputation depends on the\r\n  moral and intellectual qualities which were singularly adapted to\r\n  the circumstances of his career. In any rank of life he would\r\n  probably have attained distinction; but his prudence, his\r\n  self-denial, and his aptitude for acquiring practical knowledge,\r\n  could scarcely have found a more suitable field of exercise than\r\n  in his peculiar situation as the acknowledged head of a\r\n  constitutional monarchy.\"--_From the Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n  \"The author writes with dignity and grace, he values his\r\n  subject, and treats him with a certain courtly reverence, yet\r\n  never once sinks into the panegyrist, and while apparently most\r\n  frank--so frank, that the reticent English people may feel the\r\n  intimacy of his domestic narratives almost painful--he is\r\n  never once betrayed into a momentary indiscretion. The almost\r\n  idyllic beauty of the relation between the Prince Consort and\r\n  the Queen comes out as fully as in all previous histories of\r\n  that relation--and we have now had three--as does also a good\r\n  deal of evidence as to the Queen's own character, hitherto\r\n  always kept down, and, as it were, self effaced in publications\r\n  written or sanctioned by herself.\"--_From the London Spectator._\r\n\r\n  \"Of the abilities which have been claimed for the Prince Consort,\r\n  this work affords us small means of judging. But of his wisdom,\r\n  strong sense of duty, and great dignity and purity of character,\r\n  the volume furnishes ample evidence. In this way it will be of\r\n  service to any one who reads it.\"--_From the New York Evening\r\n  Post._\r\n\r\n  \"There is a striking contrast between this volume and the Greville\r\n  Memoirs, which relate to a period in English history immediately\r\n  preceding Prince Albert's marriage with Queen Victoria. Radical\r\n  changes were effected in court-life by Victoria's accession to the\r\n  throne.... In the work before us, which is the unfolding of a\r\n  model home-life, a life in fact unrivaled in the abodes of modern\r\n  royalty, there is nothing but what the purest mind can read with\r\n  real pleasure and profit.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Martin draws a most exquisite portraiture of the married life\r\n  of the royal pair, which seems to have been as nearly perfect as\r\n  any thing human can be. The volume closes shortly after the\r\n  Revolution of 1848, at Paris, when Louis Philippe and his hapless\r\n  queen were fleeing to England in search of an asylum from the\r\n  fearful forebodings which overhung their pathway. It was a trying\r\n  time for England, but, says Mr. Martin with true dramatic effect\r\n  in the closing passages of his book: 'When the storm burst, it\r\n  found him prepared. In rising to meet the difficulties of the\r\n  hour, the prince found the best support in the cheerful courage of\r\n  the queen,' who on the 4th of April of that same year wrote to\r\n  King Leopold: 'I never was calmer and quieter or less nervous.\r\n  Great events make me calm; it is only trifles that irritate my\r\n  nerves.' Thus ends the first volume of one of the most important\r\n  biographies of the present time. The second volume will follow as\r\n  soon as its preparation can be effected.\"--_From the Hartford\r\n  Evening Post._\r\n\r\nD. APPLETON & CO., PUBLISHERS, 549 & 551 Broadway, N.
