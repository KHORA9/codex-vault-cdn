It was not an exciting life, but it\r\nwas full of interest, and his work brought him into close relations\r\nwith many scientific men, and with many men high in the State. His\r\nreal business life commenced after he became Astronomer Royal, and\r\nfrom that time forward, during the 46 years that he remained in\r\noffice, he was so entirely wrapped up in the duties of his post that\r\nthe history of the Observatory is the history of his life. For writing\r\nhis business life there is abundant material, for he preserved all his\r\ncorrespondence, and the chief sources of information are as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) His Autobiography.\r\n    (2) His Annual Reports to the Board of Visitors.\r\n    (3) His printed Papers entitled \"Papers by G.B. Airy.\"\r\n    (4) His miscellaneous private correspondence.\r\n    (5) His letters to his wife.\r\n    (6) His business correspondence.\r\n\r\n(1) His Autobiography, after the time that he became Astronomer Royal,\r\nis, as might be expected, mainly a record of the scientific work\r\ncarried on at the Greenwich Observatory: but by no means exclusively\r\nso. About the time when he took charge of the Observatory there was an\r\nimmense development of astronomical enterprise: observatories were\r\nspringing up in all directions, and the Astronomer Royal was expected\r\nto advise upon all of the British and Colonial Observatories. It was\r\nnecessary also for him to keep in touch with the Continental\r\nObservatories and their work, and this he did very diligently and\r\nsuccessfully, both by correspondence and personal intercourse with the\r\nforeign astronomers. There was also much work on important subjects\r\nmore or less connected with his official duties--such as geodetical\r\nsurvey work, the establishment of time-balls at different places,\r\nlongitude determinations, observation of eclipses, and the\r\ndetermination of the density of the Earth. Lastly, there was a great\r\ndeal of time and work given to questions not very immediately\r\nconnected with his office, but on which the Government asked his\r\nassistance in the capacity of general scientific adviser: such were\r\nthe Correction of the Compass in iron ships, the Railway Gauge\r\nCommission, the Commission for the Restoration of the Standards of\r\nLength and Weight, the Maine Boundary, Lighthouses, the Westminster\r\nClock, the London University, and many other questions.\r\n\r\nBesides those above-mentioned there were a great many subjects which\r\nhe took up out of sheer interest in the investigations. For it may\r\nfairly be said that every subject of a distinctly practical nature,\r\nwhich could be advanced by mathematical knowledge, had an interest for\r\nhim: and his incessant industry enabled him to find time for many of\r\nthem. Amongst such subjects were Tides and Tidal Observations,\r\nClockwork, and the Strains in Beams and Bridges. A certain portion of\r\nhis time was also given to Lectures, generally on current astronomical\r\nquestions, for he held it as his duty to popularize the science as far\r\nas lay in his power. And he attended the meetings of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society with great regularity, and took a very active\r\npart in the discussions and business of the Society. He also did much\r\nwork for the Royal Society, and (up to a certain date) for the British\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nAll of the foregoing matters are recorded pretty fully in his\r\nAutobiography up to the year 1861. After that date the Autobiography\r\nis given in a much more abbreviated form, and might rather be regarded\r\nas a collection of notes for his Biography. His private history is\r\ngiven very fully for the first part of his life, but is very lightly\r\ntouched upon during his residence at Greenwich. A great part of the\r\nAutobiography is in a somewhat disjointed state, and appears to have\r\nbeen formed by extracts from a number of different sources, such as\r\nOfficial Journals, Official Correspondence, and Reports. In editing\r\nthe Autobiography it has been thought advisable to omit a large number\r\nof short notes relating to the routine work of the Observatory, to\r\ntechnical and scientific correspondence, to Papers communicated to\r\nvarious Societies and official business connected with them, and to\r\nmiscellaneous matters of minor importance. These in the aggregate\r\noccupied a great deal of time and attention. But, from their detached\r\nnature, they would have but little general interest. At various places\r\nwill be found short Memoirs and other matter by the Editor.\r\n\r\n(2) All of his Annual Reports to the Board of Visitors are attached to\r\nhis Autobiography and were evidently intended to be read with it and\r\nto form part of it. These Reports are so carefully compiled and are so\r\ncopious that they form a very complete history of the Greenwich\r\nObservatory and of the work carried on there during the time that he\r\nwas Astronomer Royal. The first Report contained only four pages, but\r\nwith the constantly increasing amount and range of work the Reports\r\nconstantly increased in volume till the later Reports contained 21\r\npages. Extracts from these Reports relating to matters of novelty and\r\nimportance, and illustrating the principles which guided him in his\r\nconduct of the Observatory, have been incorporated with the\r\nAutobiography.\r\n\r\n(3) The printed \"Papers by G.B. Airy\" are bound in 14 large quarto\r\nvolumes. There are 518 of these Papers, on a great variety of\r\nsubjects: a list of them is appended to this history, as also is a\r\nlist of the books that he wrote, and one or two of the Papers which\r\nwere separately printed. They form a very important part of his\r\nlife's work, and are frequently referred to in the present\r\nhistory. They are almost all to be found in the Transactions of\r\nSocieties or in newspapers, and extend over a period of 63 years (1822\r\nto 1885). The progress made in certain branches of science during this\r\nlong period can very fairly be traced by these Papers.\r\n\r\n(4) His private correspondence was large, and like his other papers it\r\nwas carefully arranged. No business letters of any kind are included\r\nunder this head. In this correspondence letters are occasionally found\r\neither dealing with matters of importance or in some way\r\ncharacteristic, and these have been inserted in this biography. As\r\nalready stated the Autobiography left by Airy is confined almost\r\nentirely to science and business, and touches very lightly on private\r\nmatters or correspondence.\r\n\r\n(5) The letters to his wife are very numerous. They were written\r\nduring his occasional absences from home on business or for\r\nrelaxation. On these occasions he rarely let a day pass without\r\nwriting to his wife, and sometimes he wrote twice on the same\r\nday. They are full of energy and interest and many extracts from them\r\nare inserted in this history. A great deal of the personal history is\r\ntaken from them.\r\n\r\n(6) All correspondence in any way connected with business during the\r\ntime that he was Astronomer Royal is to be found at the Royal\r\nObservatory. It is all bound and arranged in the most perfect order,\r\nand any letter throughout this time can be found with the greatest\r\nease. It is very bulky, and much of it is, in a historical sense,\r\nvery interesting. It was no doubt mainly from this correspondence that\r\nthe Autobiography, which so far as related to the Greenwich part of it\r\nwas almost entirely a business history, was compiled.\r\n\r\nThe history of the early part of his life was written in great detail\r\nand contained a large quantity of family matter which was evidently\r\nnot intended for publication. This part of the Autobiography has been\r\ncompressed. The history of the latter part of his life was not written\r\nby himself at all, and has been compiled from his Journal and other\r\nsources. In both these cases, and occasionally in short paragraphs\r\nthroughout the narrative, it has been found convenient to write the\r\nhistory in the third person.\r\n\r\n    2, THE CIRCUS,\r\n        GREENWICH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NOTE.\r\n\r\nThe Syndics of the Cambridge University Press desire to express their\r\nthanks to Messrs Macmillan & Co. for their courteous permission to use\r\nin this work the steel engraving of Sir George Biddell Airy published\r\nin _Nature_ on October 31, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPersonal Sketch of George Biddell Airy\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFrom his birth to his taking his B.A. Degree at Cambridge\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAt Trinity College, Cambridge, from his taking his B.A.  Degree to his\r\ntaking charge of the Cambridge Observatory as Plumian Professor\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge Observatory, from his taking charge of the Cambridge\r\nObservatory to his residence at Greenwich Observatory as Astronomer\r\nRoyal\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAt Greenwich Observatory, 1836-1846\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAt Greenwich Observatory, 1846-1856\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAt Greenwich Observatory, 1856-1866\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAt Greenwich Observatory, 1866-1876\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nAt Greenwich Observatory, from January 1st, 1876, to his resignation\r\nof office on August 15th, 1881\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAt the White House, Greenwich, from his resignation of office on\r\nAugust 15th, 1881, to his death on January 2nd, 1892\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX.\r\n\r\nList of Printed Papers by G.B. Airy, and List of Books written by\r\nG.B. Airy\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n               PERSONAL SKETCH OF GEORGE BIDDELL AIRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Airy's life, and especially the history of his life's\r\nwork, is given in the chapters that follow. But it is felt that the\r\npresent Memoir would be incomplete without a reference to those\r\npersonal characteristics upon which the work of his life hinged and\r\nwhich can only be very faintly gathered from his Autobiography.\r\n\r\nHe was of medium stature and not powerfully built: as he advanced in\r\nyears he stooped a good deal. His hands were large-boned and\r\nwell-formed. His constitution was remarkably sound. At no period in\r\nhis life does he seem to have taken the least interest in athletic\r\nsports or competitions, but he was a very active pedestrian and could\r\nendure a great deal of fatigue. He was by no means wanting in physical\r\ncourage, and on various occasions, especially in boating expeditions,\r\nhe ran considerable risks. In debate and controversy he had great\r\nself-reliance, and was absolutely fearless. His eye-sight was\r\npeculiar, and required correction by spectacles the lenses of which\r\nwere ground to peculiar curves according to formulae which he himself\r\ninvestigated: with these spectacles he saw extremely well, and he\r\ncommonly carried three pairs, adapted to different distances: he took\r\ngreat interest in the changes that took place in his eye-sight, and\r\nwrote several Papers on the subject. In his later years he became\r\nsomewhat deaf, but not to the extent of serious personal\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe ruling feature of his character was undoubtedly Order. From the\r\ntime that he went up to Cambridge to the end of his life his system of\r\norder was strictly maintained. He wrote his autobiography up to date\r\nsoon after he had taken his degree, and made his first will as soon as\r\nhe had any money to leave. His accounts were perfectly kept by double\r\nentry throughout his life, and he valued extremely the order of\r\nbook-keeping: this facility of keeping accounts was very useful to\r\nhim. He seems not to have destroyed a document of any kind whatever:\r\ncounterfoils of old cheque-books, notes for tradesmen, circulars,\r\nbills, and correspondence of all sorts were carefully preserved in the\r\nmost complete order from the time that he went to Cambridge; and a\r\nhuge mass they formed. To a high appreciation of order he attributed\r\nin a great degree his command of mathematics, and sometimes spoke of\r\nmathematics as nothing more than a system of order carried to a\r\nconsiderable extent. In everything he was methodical and orderly, and\r\nhe had the greatest dread of disorder creeping into the routine work\r\nof the Observatory, even in the smallest matters. As an example, he\r\nspent a whole afternoon in writing the word \"Empty\" on large cards, to\r\nbe nailed upon a great number of empty packing boxes, because he\r\nnoticed a little confusion arising from their getting mixed with other\r\nboxes containing different articles; and an assistant could not be\r\nspared for this work without withdrawing him from his appointed\r\nduties. His arrangement of the Observatory correspondence was\r\nexcellent and elaborate: probably no papers are more easy of reference\r\nthan those arranged on his system. His strict habits of order made him\r\ninsist very much upon detail in his business with others, and the\r\nrigid discipline arising out of his system of order made his rule\r\nirksome to such of his subordinates as did not conform readily to it:\r\nbut the efficiency of the Observatory unquestionably depended mainly\r\nupon it. As his powers failed with age the ruling passion for order\r\nassumed a greater prominence; and in his last days he seemed to be\r\nmore anxious to put letters which he received into their proper place\r\nfor reference than even to master their contents.\r\n\r\nHis nature was eminently practical, and any subject which had a\r\ndistinctly practical object, and could be advanced by mathematical\r\ninvestigation, possessed interest for him. And his dislike of mere\r\ntheoretical problems and investigations was proportionately great. He\r\nwas continually at war with some of the resident Cambridge\r\nmathematicians on this subject. Year after year he criticised the\r\nSenate House Papers and the Smith's Prize Papers question by question\r\nvery severely: and conducted an interesting and acrimonious private\r\ncorrespondence with Professor Cayley on the same subject. His great\r\nmathematical powers and his command of mathematics are sufficiently\r\nevidenced by the numerous mathematical treatises of the highest order\r\nwhich he published, a list of which is appended to this biography. But\r\na very important feature of his investigations was the thoroughness of\r\nthem. He was never satisfied with leaving a result as a barren\r\nmathematical expression. He would reduce it, if possible, to a\r\npractical and numerical form, at any cost of labour: and would use any\r\napproximations which would conduce to this result, rather than leave\r\nthe result in an unfruitful condition. He never shirked arithmetical\r\nwork: the longest and most laborious reductions had no terrors for\r\nhim, and he was remarkably skilful with the various mathematical\r\nexpedients for shortening and facilitating arithmetical work of a\r\ncomplex character. This power of handling arithmetic was of great\r\nvalue to him in the Observatory reductions and in the Observatory work\r\ngenerally. He regarded it as a duty to finish off his work, whatever\r\nit was, and the writer well remembers his comment on the mathematics\r\nof one of his old friends, to the effect that \"he was too fond of\r\nleaving a result in the form of three complex equations with three\r\nunknown quantities.\" To one who had known, in some degree, of the\r\nenormous quantity of arithmetical work which he had turned out, and\r\nthe unsparing manner in which he had devoted himself to it, there was\r\nsomething very pathetic in his discovery, towards the close of his\r\nlong life, \"that the figures would not add up.\"\r\n\r\nHis energy and business capacity were remarkable. He was made for work\r\nand could not long be happy without it. Whatever subject he was\r\nengaged upon, he kept his object clearly in view, and made straight\r\nfor it, aiming far more at clearness and directness than at elegance\r\nof periods or symmetry of arrangement. He wrote his letters with great\r\nease and rapidity: and having written them he very rarely had occasion\r\nto re-write them, though he often added insertions and\r\ninterlineations, even in the most important official letters. Without\r\nthis it would have been impossible for him to have turned out the\r\nenormous quantity of correspondence that he did. He never dictated\r\nletters, and only availed himself of clerical assistance in matters of\r\nthe most ordinary routine. In his excursions, as in his work, he was\r\nalways energetic, and could not endure inaction. Whatever there was of\r\ninterest in the places that he visited he examined thoroughly and\r\nwithout delay, and then passed on. And he thus accomplished a great\r\ndeal in a short vacation. His letters written to his wife, while he\r\nwas on his excursions, are very numerous and characteristic, and\r\nafford ample proofs of his incessant energy and activity both of body\r\nand mind. They are not brilliantly written, for it was not in his\r\nnature to write for effect, and he would never give himself the\r\ntrouble to study the composition of his letters, but they are\r\nstraight-forward, clear, and concise, and he was never at a loss for\r\nsuitable language to express his ideas. He had a wonderful capacity\r\nfor enjoyment: the subjects that chiefly interested him were scenery,\r\narchitecture, and antiquities, but everything novel or curious had an\r\ninterest for him. He made several journeys to the Continent, but by\r\nfar the greater number of his excursions were made in England and\r\nScotland, and there were few parts of the country which he had not\r\nvisited. He was very fond of the Lake District of Cumberland, and\r\nvisited it very frequently, and each time that he went there the same\r\nset of views had an eternal freshness for him, and he wrote long\r\ndescriptions of the scenery and effects with the same raptures as if\r\nhe had seen it for the first time. Many of his letters were written\r\nfrom Playford, a village in a beautiful part of Suffolk, a few miles\r\nfrom Ipswich. Here he had a small property, and generally stayed there\r\nfor a short time once or twice a year. He was extremely fond of this\r\ncountry, and was never tired of repeating his walks by the well-known\r\nlanes and footpaths. And, as in Cumberland, the Suffolk country had\r\nan eternal freshness and novelty for him. Wherever he went he was\r\nindefatigable in keeping up his acquaintance with his numerous friends\r\nand his letters abound in social reminiscences.\r\n\r\nHis memory was singularly retentive. It was much remarked at school in\r\nhis early days, and in the course of his life he had stored up in his\r\nmemory an incredible quantity of poetry, ballads, and miscellaneous\r\nfacts and information of all sorts, which was all constantly ready and\r\nat his service. It is almost needless to add that his memory was\r\nequally accurate and extensive in matters connected with science or\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nHis independence of character was no doubt due to and inseparable from\r\nhis great powers. The value of his scientific work greatly depended\r\nupon his self-reliance and independence of thought. And in the heavy\r\nwork of remodelling the Observatory it was a very valuable\r\nquality. This same self-reliance made him in his latter years apt to\r\ndraw conclusions too confidently and hastily on subjects which he had\r\ntaken up more as a pastime than as work. But whatever he touched he\r\ndealt with ably and in the most fearless truthseeking manner, and left\r\noriginal and vigorous opinions.\r\n\r\nHe had a remarkably well-balanced mind, and a simplicity of nature\r\nthat appeared invulnerable. No amount of hero-worship seemed to have\r\nthe least effect upon him. And from a very early time he was exposed\r\nto a great deal of it. His mind was incessantly engaged on\r\ninvestigations of Nature, and this seems to have been with him, as has\r\nbeen the case with others, a preserving influence. This simplicity of\r\ncharacter he retained throughout his life. At the same time he was\r\nsensible and shrewd in his money matters and attentive to his personal\r\ninterests. And his practical good sense in the general affairs of\r\nlife, combined with his calm and steady consideration of points\r\nsubmitted to him, made his advice very valuable. This was especially\r\nrecognized by his own and his wife's relations, who consulted him on\r\nmany occasions and placed the fullest confidence in his absolute sense\r\nof justice as well as in his wise counsel. He was extremely liberal\r\nin proportion to his means, and gave away money to a large extent to\r\nall who had any claim upon him. But he was not in any sense reckless,\r\nand kept a most cautious eye on his expenses. He was not indifferent\r\nto the honours which he received in the scientific world, but he does\r\nnot appear to have sought them in any way, and he certainly did not\r\ntrouble himself about them.\r\n\r\nHis courtesy was unfailing: no amount of trouble could shake\r\nit. Whether it was the Secretary of the Admiralty, or a servant girl\r\nwanting her fortune told: whether a begging-letter for money, or\r\nmiscellaneous invitations: all had their answer in the most clear and\r\ncourteous language. But he would not grant personal interviews when he\r\ncould avoid it: they took up too much of his time. His head was so\r\nclear that he never seemed to want for the clearest and most direct\r\nlanguage in expressing his meaning, and his letters are models of\r\nterseness.\r\n\r\nIn all his views and opinions he was strongly liberal. At Cambridge at\r\nan early date he was one of the 83 members of the Senate who supported\r\nthe application to permit the granting of medical degrees without\r\nrequiring an expression of assent to the religious doctrines of the\r\nChurch of England. And in 1868 he declined to sign a petition against\r\nthe abolition of religious declarations required of persons admitted\r\nto Fellowships or proceeding to the degree of M.A. And he was opposed\r\nto every kind of narrowness and exclusiveness. When he was appointed\r\nto the post of Astronomer Royal, he stipulated that he should not be\r\nasked to vote in any political election. But all his views were in the\r\nliberal direction. He was a great reader of theology and church\r\nhistory, and as regarded forms of worship and the interpretation of\r\nthe Scriptures, he treated them with great respect, but from the point\r\nof view of a freethinking layman. In the Preface to his \"Notes on the\r\nEarlier Hebrew Scriptures\" he says, \"In regard to the general tone of\r\nthese notes, I will first remark that I have nothing to say on the\r\nsubject of verbal inspiration. With those who entertain that doctrine,\r\nI can have nothing in common. Nor do I recognize, in the professedly\r\nhistorical accounts, any other inspiration which can exempt them from\r\nthe severest criticism that would be applicable to so-called profane\r\naccounts, written under the same general circumstances, and in the\r\nsame countries.\" And his treatment of the subject in the \"Notes\" shews\r\nhow entirely he took a rationalistic view of the whole question. He\r\nalso strongly sided with Bishop Colenso in his fearless criticism of\r\nthe Pentateuch, though he dissented from some of his conclusions. But\r\nhe was deeply imbued with the spirit of religion and reflected much\r\nupon it. His whole correspondence conveys the impression of the most\r\nsterling integrity and high-mindedness, without a trace of\r\naffectation. In no letter does there appear a shadow of wavering on\r\nmatters of principle, whether in public or private matters, and he was\r\nvery clear and positive in his convictions.\r\n\r\nThe great secret of his long and successful official career was that\r\nhe was a good servant and thoroughly understood his position. He never\r\nset himself in opposition to his masters, the Admiralty. He never\r\nhesitated to ask the Admiralty for what he thought right, whether in\r\nthe way of money grants for various objects, or for occasional\r\npermission to give his services to scientific matters not immediately\r\nconnected with the Observatory. Sometimes the Admiralty refused his\r\nrequests, and he felt this very keenly, but he was far too busy and\r\nenergetic to trouble himself about such little slights, and cheerfully\r\naccepted the situation. What was refused by one Administration was\r\nfrequently granted by another; and in the meantime he was always ready\r\nto give his most zealous assistance in any matter that was officially\r\nbrought before him. This cheerful readiness to help, combined with his\r\ngreat ability and punctuality in business matters, made him a very\r\nvaluable servant, and speaking generally he had the confidence of the\r\nAdmiralty in a remarkable degree. In many of his Reports to the Board\r\nof Visitors he speaks gratefully of the liberality of the Admiralty in\r\nforwarding scientific progress and research. In matters too which are\r\nperhaps of minor importance from the high stand-point of science, but\r\nwhich are invaluable in the conduct of an important business office,\r\nsuch for example as estimates and official correspondence, he was\r\norderly and punctual in the highest degree. And, what is by no means\r\nunimportant, he possessed an excellent official style in\r\ncorrespondence, combined with great clearness of expression. His\r\nentire honesty of purpose, and the high respect in which he was held\r\nboth at home and abroad, gave great weight to his recommendations.\r\n\r\nWith regard to his habits while he resided at the Observatory, his\r\ncustom was to work in his official room from 9 to about 2.30, though\r\nin summer he was frequently at work before breakfast. He then took a\r\nbrisk walk, and dined at about 3.30. This early hour had been\r\nprescribed and insisted upon by his physician, Dr Haviland of\r\nCambridge, in whom he had great confidence. He ate heartily, though\r\nsimply and moderately, and slept for about an hour after dinner. He\r\nthen had tea, and from about 7 to 10 he worked in the same room with\r\nhis family. He would never retire to a private room, and regarded the\r\nsociety of his family as highly beneficial in \"taking the edge off his\r\nwork.\" His powers of abstraction were remarkable: nothing seemed to\r\ndisturb him; neither music, singing, nor miscellaneous conversation.\r\nHe would then play a game or two at cards, read a few pages of a\r\nclassical or historical book, and retire at 11. On Sundays he attended\r\nmorning service at church, and in the evening read a few prayers very\r\ncarefully and impressively to his whole household. He was very\r\nhospitable, and delighted to receive his friends in a simple and\r\nnatural way at his house. In this he was most admirably aided by his\r\nwife, whose grace and skill made everything pleasant to their\r\nguests. But he avoided dinner-parties as much as possible--they\r\ninterfered too much with his work--and with the exception of\r\nscientific and official dinners he seldom dined away from home. His\r\ntastes were entirely domestic, and he was very happy in his\r\nfamily. With his natural love of work, and with the incessant calls\r\nupon him, he would soon have broken down, had it not been for his\r\nsystem of regular relaxation. Two or three times a year he took a\r\nholiday: generally a short run of a week or ten days in the spring, a\r\ntrip of a month or thereabouts in the early autumn, and about three\r\nweeks at Playford in the winter. These trips were always conducted in\r\nthe most active manner, either in constant motion from place to place,\r\nor in daily active excursions. This system he maintained with great\r\nregularity, and from the exceeding interest and enjoyment that he took\r\nin these trips his mind was so much refreshed and steadied that he\r\nalways kept himself equal to his work.\r\n\r\nAiry seems to have had a strong bent in the direction of astronomy\r\nfrom his youth, and it is curious to note how well furnished he was,\r\nby the time that he became Astronomer Royal, both with astronomy in\r\nall its branches, and with the kindred sciences so necessary for the\r\npractical working and improvement of it. At the time that he went to\r\nCambridge Physical Astronomy was greatly studied there and formed a\r\nmost important part of the University course. He eagerly availed\r\nhimself of this, and mastered the Physical Astronomy in the most\r\nthorough manner, as was evidenced by his Papers collected in his\r\n\"Mathematical Tracts,\" his investigation of the Long Inequality of the\r\nEarth and Venus, and many other works. As Plumian Professor he had\r\ncharge of the small Observatory at Cambridge, where he did a great\r\ndeal of the observing and reduction work himself, and became\r\nthoroughly versed in the practical working of an Observatory. The\r\nresult of this was immediately seen in the improved methods which he\r\nintroduced at Greenwich, and which were speedily imitated at other\r\nObservatories. Optics and the Undulatory Theory of Light had been very\r\nfavourite subjects with him, and he had written and lectured\r\nfrequently upon them. In the construction of the new and powerful\r\ntelescopes and other optical instruments required from time to time\r\nthis knowledge was very essential, for in its instrumental equipment\r\nthe Greenwich Observatory was entirely remodelled during his tenure of\r\noffice. And in many of the matters referred to him, as for instance\r\nthat of the Lighthouses, a thorough knowledge of Optics was most\r\nvaluable. He had made a great study of the theory and construction of\r\nclocks, and this knowledge was invaluable to him at Greenwich in the\r\nestablishment of new and more accurate astronomical clocks, and\r\nespecially in the improvement of chronometers. He had carefully\r\nstudied the theory of pendulums, and had learned how to use them in\r\nhis experiments in the Cornish mines. This knowledge he afterwards\r\nutilized very effectively at the Harton Pit in comparing the density\r\nof the Earth's crust with its mean density; and it was very useful to\r\nhim in connection with geodetic surveys and experiments on which he\r\nwas consulted. And his mechanical knowledge was useful in almost\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nThe subjects (outside those required for his professional work) in\r\nwhich he took most interest were Poetry, History, Theology,\r\nAntiquities, Architecture, and Engineering. He was well acquainted\r\nwith standard English poetry, and had committed large quantities to\r\nmemory, which he frequently referred to as a most valuable acquisition\r\nand an ever-present relief and comfort to his mind. History and\r\ntheology he had studied as opportunity offered, and without being\r\nwidely read in them he was much at home with them, and his powerful\r\nmemory made the most of what he did read. Antiquities and architecture\r\nwere very favourite subjects with him. He had visited most of the\r\ncamps and castles in the United Kingdom and was never tired of tracing\r\ntheir connection with ancient military events: and he wrote several\r\npapers on this subject, especially those relating to the Roman\r\ninvasions of Britain. Ecclesiastical architecture he was very fond of:\r\nhe had visited nearly all the cathedrals and principal churches in\r\nEngland, and many on the Continent, and was most enthusiastic on their\r\ndifferent styles and merits: his letters abound in critical remarks on\r\nthem. He was extremely well versed in mechanics, and in the principles\r\nand theory of construction, and took the greatest interest in large\r\nengineering works. This led to much communication with Stephenson,\r\nBrunel, and other engineers, who consulted him freely on the subject\r\nof great works on which they were engaged: in particular he rendered\r\nmuch assistance in connection with the construction of the Britannia\r\nBridge over the Menai Straits. There were various other subjects which\r\nhe read with much interest (Geology in particular), but he made no\r\nstudy of Natural History, and knew very little about it beyond\r\ndetached facts. His industry was untiring, and in going over his books\r\none by one it was very noticeable how large a number of them were\r\nfeathered with his paper \"marks,\" shewing how carefully he had read\r\nthem and referred to them. His nature was essentially cheerful, and\r\nliterature of a witty and humourous character had a great charm for\r\nhim. He was very fond of music and knew a great number of songs; and\r\nhe was well acquainted with the theory of music: but he was no\r\nperformer. He did not sketch freehand but made excellent drawings with\r\nhis Camera Lucida.\r\n\r\nAt the time when he took his degree (1823) and for many years\r\nafterwards there was very great activity of scientific investigation\r\nand astronomical enterprise in England. And, as in the times of\r\nFlamsteed and Halley, the earnest zeal of men of science occasionally\r\nled to much controversy and bitterness amongst them. Airy was by no\r\nmeans exempt from such controversies. He was a man of keen\r\nsensitiveness, though it was combined with great steadiness of temper,\r\nand he never hesitated to attack theories and methods that he\r\nconsidered to be scientifically wrong. This led to differences with\r\nIvory, Challis, South, Cayley, Archibald Smith, and others; but\r\nhowever much he might differ from them he was always personally\r\ncourteous, and the disputes generally went no farther than as regarded\r\nthe special matter in question. Almost all these controversial\r\ndiscussions were carried on openly, and were published in the\r\nAthenaeum, the Philosophical Magazine, or elsewhere; for he printed\r\nnearly everything that he wrote, and was very careful in the selection\r\nof the most suitable channels for publication. He regarded it as a\r\nduty to popularize as much as possible the work done at the\r\nObservatory, and to take the public into his confidence. And this he\r\neffected by articles communicated to newspapers, lectures, numerous\r\nPapers written for scientific societies, reports, debates, and\r\ncritiques.\r\n\r\nHis strong constitution and his regular habits, both of work and\r\nexercise, are sufficient explanation of the good health which in\r\ngeneral he enjoyed. Not but what he had sharp touches of illness from\r\ntime to time. At one period he suffered a good deal from an attack of\r\neczema, and at another from a varicose vein in his leg, and he was\r\noccasionally troubled with severe colds. But he bore these ailments\r\nwith great patience and threw them off in course of time. He was happy\r\nin his marriage and in his family, and such troubles and distresses as\r\nwere inevitable he accepted calmly and quietly. In his death, as in\r\nhis life, he was fortunate: he had no long or painful illness, and he\r\nwas spared the calamity of aberration of intellect, the saddest of all\r\nvisitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n      FROM HIS BIRTH TO HIS TAKING HIS B.A. DEGREE AT CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n              FROM JULY 27TH 1801 TO JANUARY 18TH 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Biddell Airy was born at Alnwick in Northumberland on July 27th\r\n1801. His father was William Airy of Luddington in Lincolnshire, the\r\ndescendant of a long line of Airys who have been traced back with a\r\nvery high degree of probability to a family of that name which was\r\nsettled at Kentmere in Westmorland in the 14th century. A branch of\r\nthis family migrated to Pontefract in Yorkshire, where they seem to\r\nhave prospered for many years, but they were involved in the\r\nconsequences of the Civil Wars, and one member of the family retired\r\nto Ousefleet in Yorkshire. His grandson removed to Luddington in\r\nLincolnshire, where his descendants for several generations pursued\r\nthe calling of small farmers. George Biddell Airy's mother, Ann Airy,\r\nwas the daughter of George Biddell, a well-to-do farmer in Suffolk.\r\n\r\nWilliam Airy, the father of George Biddell Airy, was a man of great\r\nactivity and strength, and of prudent and steady character. When a\r\nyoung man he became foreman on a farm in the neighbourhood of\r\nLuddington, and laid by his earnings in summer in order to educate\r\nhimself in winter. For a person in his rank, his education was\r\nunusually good, in matters of science and in English literature. But\r\nat the age of 24 he grew tired of country labour, and obtained a post\r\nin the Excise. After serving in various Collections he was appointed\r\nCollector of the Northumberland Collection on the 15th August 1800,\r\nand during his service there his eldest son George Biddell Airy was\r\nborn. The time over which his service as Officer and Supervisor\r\nextended was that in which smuggling rose to a very high pitch, and in\r\nwhich the position of Excise Officer was sometimes dangerous. He was\r\nremarkable for his activity and boldness in contests with smugglers,\r\nand made many seizures. Ann Airy, the mother of George Biddell Airy,\r\nwas a woman of great natural abilities both speculative and practical,\r\nkind as a neighbour and as head of a family, and was deeply loved and\r\nrespected. The family consisted of George Biddell, Elizabeth, William,\r\nand Arthur who died young.\r\n\r\nWilliam Airy was appointed to Hereford Collection on 22nd October\r\n1802, and removed thither shortly after. He stayed at Hereford till he\r\nwas appointed to Essex Collection on 28th February 1810, and during\r\nthis time George Biddell was educated at elementary schools in\r\nwriting, arithmetic, and a little Latin. He records of himself that he\r\nwas not a favourite with the schoolboys, for he had very little animal\r\nvivacity and seldom joined in active play with his schoolfellows. But\r\nin the proceedings of the school he was successful, and was a\r\nfavourite with his master.\r\n\r\nOn the appointment of William Airy to Essex Collection, the family\r\nremoved to Colchester on April 5th 1810. Here George Biddell was first\r\nsent to a large school in Sir Isaac's Walk, then kept by Mr Byatt\r\nWalker, and was soon noted for his correctness in orthography,\r\ngeography, and arithmetic. He evidently made rapid progress, for on\r\none occasion Mr Walker said openly in the schoolroom how remarkable it\r\nwas that a boy 10 years old should be the first in the school. At this\r\nschool he stayed till the end of 1813 and thoroughly learned\r\narithmetic (from Walkingame's book), book-keeping by double entry (on\r\nwhich knowledge throughout his life he set a special value), the use\r\nof the sliding rule (which knowledge also was specially useful to him\r\nin after life), mensuration and algebra (from Bonnycastle's books). He\r\nalso studied grammar in all its branches, and geography, and acquired\r\nsome knowledge of English literature, beginning with that admirable\r\nbook The Speaker, but it does not appear that Latin and Greek were\r\nattended to at this school. He records that at this time he learned an\r\ninfinity of snatches of songs, small romances, &c., which his powerful\r\nmemory retained most accurately throughout his life. He was no hand at\r\nactive play: but was notorious for his skill in constructing guns for\r\nshooting peas and arrows, and other mechanical contrivances. At home\r\nhe relates that he picked up a wonderful quantity of learning from his\r\nfather's books. He read and remembered much poetry from such standard\r\nauthors as Milton, Pope, Gay, Gray, Swift, &c., which was destined to\r\nprove in after life an invaluable relaxation for his mind. But he also\r\nstudied deeply an excellent Cyclopaedia called a Dictionary of Arts\r\nand Sciences in three volumes folio, and learned from it much about\r\nship-building, navigation, fortification, and many other subjects.\r\n\r\nDuring this period his valuable friendship with his uncle Arthur\r\nBiddell commenced. Arthur Biddell was a prosperous farmer and valuer\r\nat Playford near Ipswich. He was a well-informed and able man, of\r\npowerful and original mind, extremely kind and good-natured, and\r\ngreatly respected throughout the county. In the Autobiography of\r\nGeorge Biddell Airy he states as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember precisely when it was that I first visited my uncle\r\nArthur Biddell. I think it was in a winter: certainly as early as the\r\nwinter of 1812--13. Here I found a friend whose society I could enjoy,\r\nand I entirely appreciated and enjoyed the practical, mechanical, and\r\nat the same time speculative and enquiring talents of Arthur\r\nBiddell. He had a library which, for a person in middle life, may be\r\ncalled excellent, and his historical and antiquarian knowledge was not\r\nsmall. After spending one winter holiday with him, it easily came to\r\npass that I spent the next summer holiday with him: and at the next\r\nwinter holiday, finding that there was no precise arrangement for my\r\nmovements, I secretly wrote him a letter begging him to come with a\r\ngig to fetch me home with him: he complied with my request, giving no\r\nhint to my father or mother of my letter: and from that time,\r\none-third of every year was regularly spent with him till I went to\r\nCollege. How great was the influence of this on my character and\r\neducation I cannot tell. It was with him that I became acquainted with\r\nthe Messrs Ransome, W. Cubitt the civil engineer (afterwards Sir\r\nW. Cubitt), Bernard Barton, Thomas Clarkson (the slave-trade\r\nabolitionist), and other persons whose acquaintance I have valued\r\nhighly. It was also with him that I became acquainted with the works\r\nof the best modern poets, Scott, Byron, Campbell, Hogg, and others: as\r\nalso with the Waverley Novels and other works of merit.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1813 William Airy lost his appointment of Collector of Excise and\r\nwas in consequence very much straitened in his circumstances. But\r\nthere was no relaxation in the education of his children, and at the\r\nbeginning of 1814 George Biddell was sent to the endowed Grammar\r\nSchool at Colchester, then kept by the Rev. E. Crosse, and remained\r\nthere till the summer of 1819, when he went to College. The\r\nAutobiography proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I became here a respectable scholar in Latin and Greek, to the extent\r\nof accurate translation, and composition of prose Latin: in regard to\r\nLatin verses I was I think more defective than most scholars who take\r\nthe same pains, but I am not much ashamed of this, for I entirely\r\ndespise the system of instruction in verse composition.\r\n\r\n\"My father on some occasion had to go to London and brought back for\r\nme a pair of 12-inch globes. They were invaluable to me. The first\r\nstars which I learnt from the celestial globe were alpha Lyrae, alpha\r\nAquilae, alpha Cygni: and to this time I involuntarily regard these\r\nstars as the birth-stars of my astronomical knowledge. Having\r\nsomewhere seen a description of a Gunter's quadrant, I perceived that\r\nI could construct one by means of the globe: my father procured for me\r\na board of the proper shape with paper pasted on it, and on this I\r\ntraced the lines of the quadrant.\r\n\r\n\"My command of geometry was tolerably complete, and one way in which I\r\nfrequently amused myself was by making paper models (most carefully\r\ndrawn in outline) which were buttoned together without any cement or\r\nsewing. Thus I made models, not only of regular solids, regularly\r\nirregular solids, cones cut in all directions so as to shew the conic\r\nsections, and the like, but also of six-gun batteries, intrenchments\r\nand fortresses of various kinds &c.\r\n\r\n\"From various books I had learnt the construction of the steam-engine:\r\nthe older forms from the Dictionary of Arts and Sciences; newer forms\r\nfrom modern books. The newest form however (with the sliding steam\r\nvalve) I learnt from a 6-horse engine at Bawtrey's brewery (in which\r\nMr Keeling the father of my schoolfellow had acquired a\r\npartnership). I frequently went to look at this engine, and on one\r\noccasion had the extreme felicity of examining some of its parts when\r\nit was opened for repair.\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time my education was advancing at Playford. The first\r\nrecord, I believe, which I have of my attention to mechanics there is\r\nthe plan of a threshing-machine which I drew. But I was acquiring\r\nvaluable information of all kinds from the Encyclopaedia Londinensis,\r\na work which without being high in any respect is one of the most\r\ngenerally useful that I have seen. But I well remember one of the most\r\nimportant steps that I ever made. I had tried experiments with the\r\nobject-glass of an opera-glass and was greatly astonished at the\r\nappearance of the images of objects seen through the glass under\r\ndifferent conditions. By these things my thoughts were turned to\r\naccurate optics, and I read with care Rutherford's Lectures, which my\r\nuncle possessed. The acquisition of an accurate knowledge of the\r\neffect of optical constructions was one of the most charming\r\nattainments that I ever reached. Long before I went to College I\r\nunderstood the action of the lenses of a telescope better than most\r\nopticians. I also read with great zeal Nicholson's Dictionary of\r\nChemistry, and occasionally made chemical experiments of an\r\ninexpensive kind: indeed I grew so fond of this subject that there was\r\nsome thought of apprenticing me to a chemist. I also attended to\r\nsurveying and made a tolerable survey and map of my uncle's farm.\r\n\r\n\"At school I was going on successfully, and distinguished myself\r\nparticularly by my memory. It was the custom for each boy once a week\r\nto repeat a number of lines of Latin or Greek poetry, the number\r\ndepending very much on his own choice. I determined on repeating 100\r\nevery week, and I never once fell below that number and was sometimes\r\nmuch above it. It was no distress to me, and great enjoyment. At\r\nMichaelmas 1816 I repeated 2394 lines, probably without missing a\r\nword. I do not think that I was a favourite with Mr Crosse, but he\r\ncertainly had a high opinion of my powers and expressed this to my\r\nfather. My father entertained the idea of sending me to College, which\r\nMr Crosse recommended: but he heard from some college man that the\r\nexpense would be _£200_ a year, and he laid aside all thoughts of it.\r\n\r\n\"The farm of Playford Hall was in 1813 or 1814 hired by Thomas\r\nClarkson, the slave-trade abolitionist. My uncle transacted much\r\nbusiness for him (as a neighbour and friend) in the management of the\r\nfarm &c. for a time, and they became very intimate. My uncle begged\r\nhim to examine me in Classical knowledge, and he did so, I think,\r\ntwice. He also gave some better information about the probable\r\nexpenses &c. at College. The result was a strong recommendation by my\r\nuncle or through my uncle that I should be sent to Cambridge, and this\r\nwas adopted by my father. I think it likely that this was in 1816.\r\n\r\n\"In December 1816, Dealtry's Fluxions was bought for me, and I read it\r\nand understood it well. I borrowed Hutton's Course of Mathematics of\r\nold Mr Ransome, who had come to reside at Greenstead near Colchester,\r\nand read a good deal of it.\r\n\r\n\"About Ladyday 1817 I began to read mathematics with Mr Rogers\r\n(formerly, I think, a Fellow of Sidney College, and an indifferent\r\nmathematician of the Cambridge school), who had succeeded a Mr Tweed\r\nas assistant to Mr Crosse in the school. I went to his house twice a\r\nweek, on holiday afternoons. I do not remember how long I received\r\nlessons from him, but I think to June, 1818. This course was extremely\r\nvaluable to me, not on account of Mr Rogers's abilities (for I\r\nunderstood many things better than he did) but for its training me\r\nboth in Cambridge subjects and in the Cambridge accurate methods of\r\ntreating them. I went through Euclid (as far as usually read), Wood's\r\nAlgebra, Wood's Mechanics, Vince's Hydrostatics, Wood's Optics,\r\nTrigonometry (in a geometrical treatise and also in Woodhouse's\r\nalgebraical form), Fluxions to a good extent, Newton's Principia to\r\nthe end of the 9th section. This was a large quantity, but I read it\r\naccurately and understood it perfectly, and could write out any one of\r\nthe propositions which I had read in the most exact form. My connexion\r\nwith Mr Rogers was terminated by _his_ giving me notice that he could\r\nnot undertake to receive me any longer: in fact I was too much for\r\nhim. I generally read these books in a garret in our house in George\r\nLane, which was indefinitely appropriated to my brother and myself. I\r\nfind that I copied out Vince's Conic Sections in February, 1819. The\r\nfirst book that I copied was the small geometrical treatise on\r\nTrigonometry, in May, 1817: to this I was urged by old Mr Ransome,\r\nupon my complaining that I could not purchase the book: and it was no\r\nbad lesson of independence to me.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the same period 1817-1819 he was occupied at school on\r\ntranslations into blank verse from the Aeneid and Iliad, and read\r\nthrough the whole of Sophocles very carefully.\r\n\r\nThe classical knowledge which he thus gained at school and\r\nsubsequently at Cambridge was sound, and he took great pleasure in it:\r\nthroughout his life he made a practice of keeping one or other of the\r\nClassical Authors at hand for occasional relaxation. He terminated his\r\nschooling in June 1819. Shortly afterwards his father left Colchester\r\nand went to reside at Bury St Edmund's. The Autobiography proceeds as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Mr Clarkson was at one time inclined to recommend me to go to St\r\nPeter's College (which had been much enriched by a bequest from a Mr\r\nGisborne). But on giving some account of me to his friend Mr James\r\nD. Hustler, tutor of Trinity College, Mr Hustler urged upon him that I\r\nwas exactly the proper sort of person to go to Trinity College. And\r\nthus it was settled (mainly by Mr Clarkson) that I should be entered\r\nat Trinity College. I think that I was sent for purposely from\r\nColchester to Playford, and on March 6th, 1819, I rode in company with\r\nMr Clarkson from Playford to Sproughton near Ipswich to be examined by\r\nthe Rev. Mr Rogers, incumbent of Sproughton, an old M.A. of Trinity\r\nCollege; and was examined, and my certificate duly sent to Mr Hustler;\r\nand I was entered on Mr Hustler's side as Sizar of Trinity College.\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of 1819 I spent some time at Playford. On July 27th,\r\n1819 (my birthday, 18 years old), Mr Clarkson invited me to dinner, to\r\nmeet Mr Charles Musgrave, Fellow of Trinity College, who was residing\r\nfor a short time at Grundisburgh, taking the church duty there for Dr\r\nRamsden, the Rector. It was arranged that I should go to Grundisburgh\r\nthe next day (I think) to be examined in mathematics by Mr Musgrave. I\r\nwent accordingly, and Mr Musgrave set before me a paper of questions\r\nin geometry, algebra, mechanics, optics, &c. ending with the first\r\nproposition of the Principia. I knew nothing more about my answers at\r\nthe time; but I found long after that they excited so much admiration\r\nthat they were transmitted to Cambridge (I forget whether to Mr\r\nMusgrave's brother, a Fellow of Trinity College and afterwards\r\nArchbishop of York, or to Mr Peacock, afterwards Dean of Ely) and were\r\nlong preserved.\r\n\r\n\"The list of the Classical subjects for the first year in Trinity\r\nCollege was transmitted to me, as usual, by Mr Hustler. They were--The\r\nHippolytus of Euripides, the 3rd Book of Thucydides, and the 2nd\r\nPhilippic of Cicero. These I read carefully and noted before going\r\nup. Mr Hustler's family lived in Bury; and I called on him and saw him\r\nin October, introduced by Mr Clarkson. On the morning of October 18th,\r\n1819, I went on the top of the coach to Cambridge, knowing nobody\r\nthere but Mr Hustler, but having letters of introduction from Mr\r\nCharles Musgrave to Professor Sedgwick, Mr Thomas Musgrave, and Mr\r\nGeorge Peacock, all Fellows of Trinity College.\r\n\r\n\"I was set down at the Hoop, saw Trinity College for the first time,\r\nfound Mr Hustler, was conducted by his servant to the robe-maker's,\r\nwhere I was invested in the cap and blue gown, and after some further\r\nwaiting was installed into lodgings in Bridge Street. At 4 o'clock I\r\nwent to the College Hall and was introduced by Mr Hustler to several\r\nundergraduates, generally clever men, and in the evening I attended\r\nChapel in my surplice (it being St Luke's day) and witnessed that\r\nsplendid service of which the occasional exhibition well befits the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as possible, I called on Mr Peacock, Mr Musgrave, and\r\nProfessor Sedgwick. By all I was received with great kindness: my\r\nexamination papers had been sent to them, and a considerable\r\nreputation preceded me. Mr Peacock at once desired that I would not\r\nconsider Mr C. Musgrave's letter as an ordinary introduction, but that\r\nI would refer to him on all occasions. And I did so for several years,\r\nand always received from him the greatest assistance that he could\r\ngive. I think that I did not become acquainted with Mr Whewell till\r\nthe next term, when I met him at a breakfast party at Mr Peacock's. Mr\r\nPeacock at once warned me to arrange for taking regular exercise, and\r\nprescribed a walk of two hours every day before dinner: a rule to\r\nwhich I attended regularly, and to which I ascribe the continuance of\r\ngood general health.\r\n\r\n\"I shewed Mr Peacock a manuscript book which contained a number of\r\noriginal Propositions which I had investigated. These much increased\r\nmy reputation (I really had sense enough to set no particular value on\r\nit) and I was soon known by sight to almost everybody in the\r\nUniversity. A ridiculous little circumstance aided in this. The former\r\nrule of the University (strictly enforced) had been that all students\r\nshould wear drab knee-breeches: and I, at Mr Clarkson's\r\nrecommendation, was so fitted up. The struggle between the old dress\r\nand the trowsers customary in society was still going on but almost\r\nterminated, and I was one of the very few freshmen who retained the\r\nold habiliments. This made me in some measure distinguishable:\r\nhowever at the end of my first three terms I laid these aside.\r\n\r\n\"The College Lectures began on Oct. 22: Mr Evans at 9 on the\r\nHippolytus, and Mr Peacock at 10 on Euclid (these being the Assistant\r\nTutors on Mr Hustler's side): and then I felt myself established.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote in a day or two to my uncle Arthur Biddell, and I received\r\nfrom him a letter of the utmost kindness. He entered gravely on the\r\nconsideration of my prospects, my wants, &c.: and offered at all times\r\nto furnish me with money, which he thought my father's parsimonious\r\nhabits might make him unwilling to do. I never had occasion to avail\r\nmyself of this offer: but it was made in a way which in no small\r\ndegree strengthened the kindly feelings that had long existed between\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"I carefully attended the lectures, taking notes as appeared\r\nnecessary. In Mathematics there were geometrical problems, algebra,\r\ntrigonometry (which latter subjects the lectures did not reach till\r\nthe terms of 1820). Mr Peacock gave me a copy of Lacroix's\r\nDifferential Calculus as translated by himself and Herschel and\r\nBabbage, and also a copy of their Examples. At this time, the use of\r\nDifferential Calculus was just prevailing over that of Fluxions (which\r\nI had learnt). I betook myself to it with great industry. I also made\r\nmyself master of the theories of rectangular coordinates and some of\r\nthe differential processes applying to them, which only a few of the\r\nbest of the university mathematicians then wholly possessed. In\r\nClassical subjects I read the Latin (Seneca's) and English Hippolytus,\r\nRacine's Phèdre (which my sister translated for me), and all other\r\nbooks to which I was referred, Aristotle, Longinus, Horace, Bentley,\r\nDawes &c., made verse translations of the Greek Hippolytus, and was\r\nconstantly on the watch to read what might be advantageous.\r\n\r\n\"Early in December Mr Hustler sent for me to say that one of the\r\nCompany of Fishmongers, Mr R. Sharp, had given to Mr John H. Smyth,\r\nM.P. for Norwich, the presentation to a small exhibition of _£20_ a\r\nyear, which Mr Smyth had placed in Mr Hustler's hands, and which Mr\r\nHustler immediately conferred on me. This was my first step towards\r\npecuniary independence. I retained this exhibition till I became a\r\nFellow of the College.\r\n\r\n\"I stayed at Cambridge during part of the winter vacation, and to\r\navoid expense I quitted my lodgings and went for a time into\r\nsomebody's rooms in the Bishop's Hostel. (It is customary for the\r\ntutors to place students in rooms when their right owners are absent.)\r\nI took with me Thucydides and all relating to it, and read the book,\r\nupon which the next term's lectures were to be founded, very\r\ncarefully. The latter part of the vacation I spent at Bury, where I\r\nbegan with the assistance of my sister to pick up a little French: as\r\nI perceived that it was absolutely necessary for enabling me to read\r\nmodern mathematics.\r\n\r\n\"During a part of the time I employed myself in writing out a paper on\r\nthe geometrical interpretation of the algebraical expression\r\nsqrt(-1). I think that the original suggestion of perpendicular line\r\ncame from some book (I do not remember clearly), and I worked it out\r\nin several instances pretty well, especially in De Moivre's Theorem. I\r\nhad spoken of it in the preceding term to Mr Peacock and he encouraged\r\nme to work it out. The date at the end is 1820, January 21. When some\r\ntime afterwards I spoke of it to Mr Hustler, he disapproved of my\r\nemploying my time on such speculations. About the last day of January\r\nI returned to Cambridge, taking up my abode in my former lodgings. I\r\nshewed my paper on sqrt(-1) to Mr Peacock, who was much pleased with\r\nit and shewed it to Mr Whewell and others.\r\n\r\n\"On February 1 I commenced two excellent customs. The first was that\r\nI always had upon my table a quire of large-sized scribbling-paper\r\nsewn together: and upon this paper everything was entered:\r\ntranslations into Latin and out of Greek, mathematical problems,\r\nmemoranda of every kind (the latter transferred when necessary to the\r\nsubsequent pages), and generally with the date of the day. This is a\r\nmost valuable custom. The other was this: as I perceived that to write\r\nLatin prose well would be useful to me, I wrote a translation of\r\nEnglish into Latin every day. However much pressed I might be with\r\nother business, I endeavoured to write at least three or four words,\r\nbut if possible I wrote a good many sentences.\r\n\r\n\"I may fix upon this as the time when my daily habits were settled in\r\nthe form in which they continued for several years. I rose in time for\r\nthe chapel service at 7. It was the College regulation that every\r\nstudent should attend Chapel four mornings and four evenings (Sunday\r\nbeing one of each) in every week: and in this I never failed. After\r\nchapel service I came to my lodgings and breakfasted. At 9 I went to\r\nCollege lectures, which lasted to 11. Most of my contemporaries, being\r\nintended for the Church, attended also divinity lectures: but I never\r\ndid. I then returned, put my lecture notes in order, wrote my piece of\r\nLatin prose, and then employed myself on the subject which I was\r\nreading for the time: usually taking mathematics at this hour. At 2 or\r\na little sooner I went out for a long walk, usually 4 or 5 miles into\r\nthe country: sometimes if I found companions I rowed on the Cam (a\r\npractice acquired rather later). A little before 4 I returned, and at\r\n4 went to College Hall. After dinner I lounged till evening chapel\r\ntime, 1/2 past 5, and returning about 6 I then had tea. Then I read\r\nquietly, usually a classical subject, till 11; and I never, even in\r\nthe times when I might seem most severely pressed, sat up later.\r\n\r\n\"From this time to the close of the annual examination (beginning of\r\nJune) I remained at Cambridge, stopping there through the Easter\r\nVacation. The subjects of the mathematical lectures were ordinary\r\nalgebra and trigonometry: but Mr Peacock always had some private\r\nproblems of a higher class for me, and saw me I believe every day. The\r\nsubjects of the Classical lectures were, the termination of\r\nHippolytus, the book of Thucydides and the oration of Cicero. In\r\nmathematics I read Whewell's Mechanics, then just published (the first\r\ninnovation made in the Cambridge system of Physical Sciences for many\r\nyears): and I find in my scribbling-paper notes, integrals, central\r\nforces, Finite Differences, steam-engine constructions and powers,\r\nplans of bridges, spherical trigonometry, optical calculations\r\nrelating to the achromatism of eye-pieces and achromatic\r\nobject-glasses with lenses separated, mechanical problems, Transit of\r\nVenus, various problems in geometrical astronomy (I think it was at\r\nthis time that Mr Peacock had given me a copy of Woodhouse's Astronomy\r\n1st Edition), the rainbow, plans for anemometer and for a wind-pumping\r\nmachine, clearing lunars, &c., with a great number of geometrical\r\nproblems. I remark that my ideas on the Differential Calculus had not\r\nacquired on some important points the severe accuracy which they\r\nacquired in a few months. In Classics I read the Persae of Aeschylus,\r\nGreek and Roman history very much (Mitford, Hooke, Ferguson) and the\r\nbooks of Thucydides introductory to that of the lecture subject (the\r\n3rd): and attended to Chronology. On the scribbling-paper are\r\nverse-translations from Euripides, careful prose-translations from\r\nThucydides, maps, notes on points of grammar &c. I have also little\r\nMS. books with abundant notes on all these subjects: I usually made a\r\nlittle book when I pursued any subject in a regular way.\r\n\r\n\"On May 1st Mr Dobree, the head lecturer, sent for me to say that he\r\nappointed me head-lecturer's Sizar for the next year. The stipend of\r\nthis office was _£10_, a sum upon which I set considerable value in my\r\nanxiety for pecuniary independence: but it was also gratifying to me\r\nas shewing the way in which I was regarded by the College authorities.\r\n\r\n\"On Wednesday, May 24th, 1820, the examination began. I was anxious\r\nabout the result of the examination, but only in such a degree as to\r\nmake my conduct perfectly steady and calm, and to prevent me from\r\nattempting any extraordinary exertion.\r\n\r\n\"When the Classes were published the first Class of the Freshman's\r\nYear (alphabetically arranged, as is the custom) stood thus: Airy,\r\nBoileau, Childers, Drinkwater, Field, Iliff, Malkin, Myers, Romilly,\r\nStrutt, Tate, Winning. It was soon known however that I was first of\r\nthe Class. It was generally expected (and certainly by me) that,\r\nconsidering how great a preponderance the Classics were understood, in\r\nthe known system of the College, to have in determining the order of\r\nmerit, Field would be first. However the number of marks which Field\r\nobtained was about 1700, and that which I obtained about 1900. No\r\nother competitor, I believe, was near us.\"--In a letter to Airy from\r\nhis College Tutor, Mr J. D. Hustler, there is the following passage:\r\n\"It is a matter of extreme satisfaction to me that in the late\r\nexamination you stood not only in the First Class but first of the\r\nfirst. I trust that your future exertions and success will be\r\ncommensurate with this honourable beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the men whom I have named, Drinkwater (Bethune) was afterwards\r\nLegal Member of the Supreme Court of India, Field was afterwards\r\nRector of Reepham, Romilly (afterwards Lord Romilly) became\r\nSolicitor-General, Strutt (afterwards Lord Belper) became M.P. for\r\nDerby and First Commissioner of Railways, Tate was afterwards master\r\nof Richmond Endowed School, Childers was the father of Childers who\r\nwas subsequently First Lord of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\"I returned to Bury immediately. While there, some students (some of\r\nthem men about to take their B.A. degree at the next January) applied\r\nto me to take them as pupils, but I declined. This year of my life\r\nenabled me to understand how I stood among men. I returned to\r\nCambridge about July 11th. As a general rule, undergraduates are not\r\nallowed to reside in the University during the Long Vacation. I\r\nbelieve that before I left, after the examination, I had made out that\r\nI should be permitted to reside: or I wrote to Mr  Hustler. I applied\r\nto Mr Hustler to be lodged in rooms in College: and was put, first\r\ninto rooms in Bishop's Hostel, and subsequently into rooms in the\r\nGreat Court.\r\n\r\n\"The first affair that I had in College was one of disappointment by\r\nno means deserving the importance which it assumed in my thoughts. I\r\nhad been entered a Sizar, but as the list of Foundation Sizars was\r\nfull, my dinners in Hall were paid for. Some vacancies had arisen: and\r\nas these were to be filled up in order of merit, I expected one: and\r\nin my desire for pecuniary independence I wished for it very\r\nearnestly. However, as in theory all of the first class were equal,\r\nand as there were some Sizars in it senior in entrance to me, they\r\nobtained places first: and I was not actually appointed till after the\r\nnext scholarship examination (Easter 1821). However a special\r\narrangement was made, allowing me (I forget whether others) to sit at\r\nthe Foundation-Sizars' table whenever any of the number was absent:\r\nand in consequence I received practically nearly the full benefits.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Peacock, who was going out for the vacation, allowed me access to\r\nhis books. I had also (by the assistance of various Fellows, who all\r\ntreated me with great kindness, almost to a degree of respect) command\r\nof the University Library and Trinity Library: and spent this Long\r\nVacation, like several others, very happily indeed.\r\n\r\n\"The only non-mathematical subjects of the next examination were The\r\nGospel of St Luke, Paley's Evidences, and Paley's Moral and Political\r\nPhilosophy. Thus my time was left more free to mathematics and to\r\ngeneral classics than last year. I now began a custom which I\r\nmaintained for some years. Generally I read mathematics in the\r\nmorning, and classics for lectures in the afternoon: but invariably I\r\nbegan at 10 o'clock in the evening to read with the utmost severity\r\nsome standard classics (unconnected with the lectures) and at 11\r\nprecisely I left off and went to bed. I continued my daily\r\ntranslations into Latin prose as before.\r\n\r\n\"On August 24th, 1820, Rosser, a man of my own year, engaged me as\r\nprivate tutor, paying at the usual rate (_£14_ for a part of the\r\nVacation, and _£14_ for a term): and immediately afterwards his friend\r\nBedingfield did the same. This occupied two hours every day, and I\r\nfelt that I was now completely earning my own living. I never received\r\na penny from my friends after this time.\r\n\r\n\"I find on my scribbling-paper various words which shew that in\r\nreading Poisson I was struggling with French words. There are also\r\nFinite Differences and their Calculus, Figure of the Earth (force to\r\nthe center), various Attractions (some evidently referring to\r\nMaclaurin's), Integrals, Conic Sections, Kepler's Problem, Analytical\r\nGeometry, D'Alembert's Theorem, Spherical Aberration, Rotations round\r\nthree axes (apparently I had been reading Euler), Floating bodies,\r\nEvolute of Ellipse, Newton's treatment of the Moon's Variation. I\r\nattempted to extract something from Vince's Astronomy on the physical\r\nexplanation of Precession: but in despair of understanding it, and\r\nhaving made out an explanation for myself by the motion round three\r\naxes, I put together a little treatise (Sept. 10, 1820) which with\r\nsome corrections and additions was afterwards printed in my\r\nMathematical Tracts. On Sept. 14th I bought Woodhouse's Physical\r\nAstronomy, and this was quite an epoch in my mathematical\r\nknowledge. First, I was compelled by the process of \"changing the\r\nindependent variable\" to examine severely the logic of the\r\nDifferential Calculus. Secondly, I was now able to enter on the Theory\r\nof Perturbations, which for several years had been the desired land to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"At the Fellowship Election of Oct. 1st, Sydney Walker (among other\r\npersons) was elected Fellow. He then quitted the rooms in which he had\r\nlived (almost the worst in the College), and I immediately took\r\nthem. They suited me well and I lived very happily in them till I was\r\nelected Scholar. They are small rooms above the middle staircase on\r\nthe south side of Neville's Court. (Mr Peacock's rooms were on the\r\nsame staircase.) I had access to the leads on the roof of the building\r\nfrom one of my windows. This was before the New Court was built: my\r\nbest window looked upon the garden of the College butler.\r\n\r\n\"I had brought to Cambridge the telescope which I had made at\r\nColchester, and about this time I had a stand made by a carpenter at\r\nCambridge: and I find repeated observations of Jupiter and Saturn made\r\nin this October term.\r\n\r\n\"Other mathematical subjects on my scribbling-paper are: Geometrical\r\nAstronomy, Barometers (for elevations), Maclaurin's Figure of the\r\nEarth, Lagrange's Theorem, Integrals, Differential Equations of the\r\nsecond order, Particular Solutions. In general mathematics I had much\r\ndiscussion with Atkinson (who was Senior Wrangler, January 1821), and\r\nin Physics with Rosser, who was a friend of Sir Richard Phillips, a\r\nvain objector to gravitation. In Classics I read Aeschylus and\r\nHerodotus.\r\n\r\n\"On October 5th I received notice from the Head Lecturer to declaim in\r\nEnglish with Winning. (This exercise consists in preparing a\r\ncontroversial essay, learning it by heart, and speaking it in Chapel\r\nafter the Thursday evening's service.)  On October 6th we agreed on\r\nthe subject, \"Is natural difference to be ascribed to moral or to\r\nphysical causes?\" I taking the latter side. I spoke the declamation\r\n(reciting it without missing a word) on October 25th. On October 26th\r\nI received notice of Latin declamation with Myers: subject agreed on,\r\n\"Utrum civitati plus utilitatis an incommodi afferant leges quae ad\r\nvitas privatorum hominum ordinandas pertinent\"; I took the former. The\r\ndeclamation was recited on November 11, when a curious circumstance\r\noccurred. My declamation was rather long: it was the first Saturday of\r\nthe term on which a declamation had been spoken: and it was the day on\r\nwhich arrived the news of the withdrawal of the Bill of Pains and\r\nPenalties against Queen Caroline. (This trial had been going on\r\nthrough the summer, but I knew little about it.) In consequence the\r\nimpatience of the undergraduates was very great, and there was such an\r\nuproar of coughing &c. in the Chapel as probably was never known. The\r\nMaster (Dr Wordsworth, appointed in the beginning of the summer on the\r\ndeath of Dr Mansell, and to whom I had been indirectly introduced by\r\nMrs Clarkson) and Tutors and Deans tried in vain to stop the\r\nhubbub. However I went on steadily to the end, not at all\r\nfrightened. On the Monday the Master sent for me to make a sort of\r\napology in the name of the authorities, and letters to the Tutors were\r\nread at the Lectures, and on the whole the transaction was nowise\r\ndisagreeable to me.\r\n\r\n\"On the Commemoration Day, December 15th, I received my Prize\r\n(Mitford's Greece) as First-Class man, after dinner in the College\r\nHall. After a short vacation spent at Bury and Playford I returned to\r\nCambridge, walking from Bury on Jan. 22nd, 1821. During the next term\r\nI find in Mathematics Partial Differential Equations, Tides, Sound,\r\nCalculus of Variations, Composition of rotary motions, Motion in\r\nresisting medium, Lhuillier's theorem, Brightness of an object as seen\r\nthrough a medium with any possible law of refraction (a good\r\ninvestigation), star-reductions, numerical calculations connected with\r\nthem, equilibrium of chain under centripetal force (geometrically\r\ntreated, as an improvement upon Whewell's algebraical method),\r\ninvestigation of the magnitude of attractive forces of glass, &c.,\r\nrequired to produce refraction. I forget about Mathematical Lectures;\r\nbut I have an impression that I regularly attended Mr Peacock's\r\nlectures, and that he always set me some private problems.\r\n\r\n\"I attended Mr Evans's lectures on St Luke: and I find many notes\r\nabout the history of the Jews, Cerinthus and various heresies, Paley's\r\nMoral Philosophy, Paley's Evidences, and Biblical Maps: also\r\nspeculations about ancient pronunciations.\r\n\r\n\"For a week or more before the annual examination I was perfectly\r\nlazy. The Classes of my year (Junior Sophs) were not published till\r\nJune 11. It was soon known that I was first with 2000 marks, the next\r\nbeing Drinkwater with 1200 marks. After a short holiday at Bury and\r\nPlayford I returned to Cambridge on July 18th, 1821. My daily life\r\nwent on as usual. I find that in writing Latin I began Cicero De\r\nSenectute (retranslating Melmoth's translation, and comparing). Some\r\ntime in the Long Vacation the names of the Prizemen for Declamations\r\nwere published: I was disappointed that not one, English or Latin, was\r\nassigned to me: but it was foolish, for my declamations were rather\r\ntrumpery.\r\n\r\n\"My former pupil, Rosser, came again on August 14th. On August 29th\r\nDr Blomfield (afterwards Bishop of London) called, to engage me as\r\nTutor to his brother George Beecher Blomfield, and he commenced\r\nattendance on Sept. 1st. With these two pupils I finished at the end\r\nof the Long Vacation: for the next three terms I had one pupil,\r\nGibson, a Newcastle man, recommended by Mr Peacock, I believe, as a\r\npersonal friend (Mr Peacock being of Durham).\r\n\r\n\"The only classical subject appointed for the next examination was the\r\n5th, 6th and 7th Books of the Odyssey: the mathematical subjects all\r\nthe Applied Mathematics and Newton. There was to be however the\r\nScholarship Examination (Sizars being allowed to sit for Scholarships\r\nonly in their 3rd year: and the Scholarship being a kind of little\r\nFellowship necessary to qualify for being a candidate for the real\r\nFellowship).\r\n\r\n\"When the October term began Mr Hustler, who usually gave lectures in\r\nmathematics to his third-year pupils, said to me that it was not worth\r\nmy while to attend his lectures, and he or Mr Peacock suggested that\r\nDrinkwater, Myers, and I should attend the Questionists'\r\nexaminations. The Questionists are those who are to take the degree of\r\nB.A. in the next January: and it was customary, not to give them\r\nlectures, but three times a week to examine them by setting\r\nmathematical questions, as the best method of preparing for the\r\nB.A. examination. Accordingly it was arranged that we should attend\r\nthe said examinations: but when we went the Questionists of that year\r\nrefused to attend. They were reported to be a weak year, and we to be\r\na strong one: and they were disposed to take offence at us on any\r\noccasion. From some of the scholars of our year who sat at table with\r\nscholars of that year I heard that they distinguished us as 'the\r\nimpudent year,' 'the annus mirabilis' &c. On this occasion they\r\npretended to believe that the plan of our attendance at the\r\nQuestionists' examinations had been suggested by an undergraduate, and\r\nno explanation was of the least use. So the Tutors agreed not to press\r\nthe matter on them: and instead of it, Drinkwater, Myers, and I went\r\nthree times a week to Mr Peacock's rooms, and he set us questions. I\r\nthink that this system was also continued during the next two terms\r\n(ending in June 1822) or part of them, but I am not certain.\r\n\r\n\"In August 1821 I copied out a M.S. on Optics, I think from Mr\r\nWhewell: on August 24th one on the Figure of the Earth and Tides; and\r\nat some other time one on the motion of a body round two centers of\r\nforce; both from Mr Whewell. On my scribbling paper I find--A problem\r\non the vibrations of a gig as depending on the horse's step (like that\r\nof a pendulum whose support is disturbed), Maclaurin's Attractions,\r\nEffect of separating the lenses of an achromatic object-glass\r\n(suggested by my old telescope), Barlow's theory of numbers, and\r\ndivision of the circle into 17 parts, partial differentials, theory of\r\neye-pieces, epicycloids, Figure of the Earth, Time of body in arc of\r\nparabola, Problem of Sound, Tides, Refraction of Lens, including\r\nthickness, &c., Ivory's paper on Equations, Achromatism of microscope,\r\nCapillary Attraction, Motions of Fluids, Euler's principal axes,\r\nSpherical pendulum, Equation b²(d²y/dx²)=(d²y/dt²), barometer, Lunar\r\nTheory well worked out, ordinary differential equations, Calculus of\r\nVariations, Interpolations like Laplace's for Comets, Kepler's\r\ntheorem. In September I had my old telescope mounted on a short tripod\r\nstand, and made experiments on its adjustments. I was possessed of\r\nWhite's Ephemeris, and I find observations of Jupiter and Saturn in\r\nOctober. I planned an engine for describing ellipses by the polar\r\nequation A/(1 + e cos theta) and tried to make a micrometer with silk\r\nthreads converging to a point. Mr Cubitt called on Oct. 4 and Nov. 1;\r\nhe was engaged in erecting a treadmill at Cambridge Gaol, and had some\r\nthoughts of sending plans for the Cambridge Observatory, the erection\r\nof which was then proposed. On Nov. 19 I find that I had received from\r\nCubitt a Nautical Almanac, the first that I had. On Dec. 11 I made\r\nsome experiments with Drinkwater: I think it was whirling a glass\r\ncontaining oil on water. In Classics I was chiefly engaged upon\r\nThucydides and Homer. On October 6th I had a letter from Charles\r\nMusgrave, introducing Challis, who succeeded me in the Cambridge\r\nObservatory in 1836.\r\n\r\n\"At this time my poor afflicted father was suffering much from a\r\nsevere form of rheumatism or pain in the legs which sometimes\r\nprevented him from going to bed for weeks together.\r\n\r\n\"On the Commemoration Day, Dec. 18th, I received my prize as\r\nfirst-class man in Hall again. The next day I walked to Bury, and\r\npassed the winter vacation there and at Playford.\r\n\r\n\"I returned to Cambridge on Jan. 24th, 1822. On Feb. 12th I kept my\r\nfirst Act, with great compliments from the Moderator, and with a most\r\nunusually large attendance of auditors. These disputations on\r\nmathematics, in Latin, are now discontinued. On March 20th I kept a\r\nfirst Opponency against Sandys. About this time I received Buckle, a\r\nTrinity man of my own year, who was generally supposed to come next\r\nafter Drinkwater, as pupil. On my sheets I find integrals and\r\ndifferential equations of every kind, astronomical corrections (of\r\nwhich I prepared a book), chances, Englefield's comets, investigation\r\nof the brightness within a rainbow, proof of Clairaut's theorem in one\r\ncase, metacentres, change of independent variable applied to a\r\ncomplicated case, generating functions, principal axes. On Apr. 8th I\r\nintended to write an account of my eye: I was then tormented with a\r\ndouble image, I suppose from some disease of the stomach: and on May\r\n28th I find by a drawing of the appearance of a lamp that the disease\r\nof my eye continued.\r\n\r\n\"On Feb. 11th I gave Mr Peacock a paper on the alteration of the focal\r\nlength of a telescope as directed with or against the Earth's orbital\r\nmotion (on the theory of emissions) which was written out for reading\r\nto the Cambridge Philosophical Society on Feb. 24th and 25th. [This\r\nSociety I think was then about a year old.] On Feb. 1 my MS. on\r\nPrecession, Solar Inequality, and Nutation, was made complete.\r\n\r\n\"The important examination for Scholarships was now approaching. As I\r\nhave said, this one opportunity only was given to Sizars (Pensioners\r\nhaving always two opportunities and sometimes three), and it is\r\nnecessary to be a Scholar in order to be competent to be a candidate\r\nfor a Fellowship. On Apr. 10th I addressed my formal Latin letter to\r\nthe Seniors. There were 13 vacancies and 37 candidates. The election\r\ntook place on Apr. 18th, 1822. I was by much the first (which I hardly\r\nexpected) and was complimented by the Master and others. Wrote the\r\nformal letter of thanks as usual. I was now entitled to claim better\r\nrooms, and I took the rooms on the ground floor on the East side of\r\nthe Queen's Gate of the Great Court. Even now I think of my quiet\r\nresidence in the little rooms above the staircase in Neville's Court\r\nwith great pleasure. I took possession of my new rooms on May 27th.\r\n\r\n\"The Annual Examination began on May 30th. The Classes were published\r\non June 5th, when my name was separated from the rest by two lines. It\r\nwas understood that the second man was Drinkwater, and that my number\r\nof marks was very nearly double of his. Having at this time been\r\ndisappointed of a proposed walking excursion into Derbyshire with a\r\ncollege friend, who failed me at the last moment, I walked to Bury and\r\nspent a short holiday there and at Playford.\r\n\r\n\"I returned to Cambridge on July 12th, 1822. I was steadily busy\r\nduring this Long Vacation, but by no means oppressively so: indeed my\r\ntime passed very happily. The Scholars' Table is the only one in\r\nCollege at which the regular possessors of the table are sure never to\r\nsee a stranger, and thus a sort of family intimacy grows up among the\r\nScholars. Moreover the Scholars feel themselves to be a privileged\r\nclass 'on the foundation,' and this feeling gives them a sort of\r\nconceited happiness. It was the duty of Scholars by turns to read\r\nGrace after the Fellows' dinner and supper, and at this time (1848) I\r\nknow it by heart. They also read the Lessons in Chapel on week days:\r\nbut as there was no daily chapel-service during the summer vacation, I\r\nhad not much of this. In the intimacy of which I speak I became much\r\nacquainted with Drinkwater, Buckle, Rothman, and Sutcliffe: and we\r\nformed a knot at the table (first the Undergraduate Scholars' table,\r\nand afterwards the Bachelor Scholars' table) for several years. During\r\nthis Vacation I had for pupils Buckle and Gibson.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote my daily Latin as usual, beginning with the retranslation of\r\nCicero's Epistles, but I interrupted it from Sept. 27th to Feb. 8th. I\r\nbelieve it was in this Vacation, or in the October term, that I began\r\nevery evening to read Thucydides very carefully, as my notes are\r\nmarked 1822 and 1823. On August 27 I find that I was reading Ovid's\r\nFasti.\r\n\r\n\"In Mathematics I find the equation x + y = a, x^q + y^q = b,\r\nCaustics, Calculus of Variations, Partial Differentials, Aberration of\r\nLight, Motions of Comets, various Optical constructions computed with\r\nspherical aberrations, Particular Solutions, Mechanics of Solid\r\nBodies, Attractions of Shells, Chances, Ivory's attraction-theorem,\r\nLunar Theory (algebraical), Degrees across meridian, theoretical\r\nrefraction, Newton's 3rd Book, Investigation of the tides in a shallow\r\nequatoreal canal, from which I found that there would be low-water\r\nunder the moon, metacentres, rotation of a solid body round three\r\naxes, Attractions of Spheroids of variable density, finite\r\ndifferences, and complete Figure of the Earth. There is also a good\r\ndeal of investigation of a mathematical nature not connected with\r\nCollege studies, as musical chords, organ-pipes, sketch for a\r\ncomputing machine (suggested by the publications relating to\r\nBabbage's), sketch of machine for solving equations. In August there\r\nis a plan of a MS. on the Differential Calculus, which it appears I\r\nwrote then: one on the Figure of the Earth written about August 15th;\r\none on Tides, Sept. 25th; one on Newton's Principia with algebraical\r\nadditions, Nov. 1st. On Sept. 6th and 10th there are Lunar Distances\r\nobserved with Rothman's Sextant and completely worked out; for these I\r\nprepared a printed skeleton form, I believe my first. On December 13th\r\nthere are references to books on Geology (Conybeare and Phillips, and\r\nParkinson) which I was beginning to study. On July 27th, being the day\r\non which I completed my 21st year, I carefully did nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Another subject partly occupied my thoughts, which, though not (with\r\nreference to practical science) very wise, yet gave me some Cambridge\r\ncelebrity. In July 1819 I had (as before mentioned) sketched a plan\r\nfor constructing reflecting telescopes with silvered glass, and had\r\nshewn it afterwards to Mr Peacock. I now completed the theory of this\r\nconstruction by correcting the aberrations, spherical as well as\r\nchromatic. On July 13th, 1822, I drew up a paper about it for Mr\r\nPeacock. He approved it much, and in some way communicated it to Mr\r\n(afterwards Sir John) Herschel. I was soon after introduced to\r\nHerschel at a breakfast with Mr Peacock: and he approved of the scheme\r\ngenerally. On August 5th I drew up a complete mathematical paper for\r\nthe Cambridge Philosophical Society, which I entrusted to Mr\r\nPeacock. The aberrations, both spherical and chromatic, are here\r\nworked out very well. On Nov. 25th it was read at the meeting of the\r\nPhilosophical Society, and was afterwards printed in their\r\nTransactions: this was my first printed Memoir. Before this time\r\nhowever I had arranged to try the scheme practically. Mr Peacock had\r\nengaged to bear the expense, but I had no occasion to ask him. Partly\r\n(I think) through Drinkwater, I communicated with an optician named\r\nBancks, in the Strand, who constructed the optical part. I\r\nsubsequently tried my telescope, but it would not do. The fault, as I\r\nhad not and have not the smallest doubt, depends in some way on the\r\ncrystallization of the mercury silvering. It must have been about this\r\ntime that I was introduced to Mr (afterwards Sir James) South, at a\r\nparty at Mr Peacock's rooms. He advised me to write to Tulley, a\r\nwell-known practical optician, who made me some new reflectors,\r\n&c. (so that I had two specimens, one Gregorian, the other\r\nCassegrainian). However the thing failed practically, and I was too\r\nbusy ever after to try it again.\r\n\r\n\"During the October term I had no pupils. I kept my second Act on\r\nNov. 6 (opponents Hamilton, Rusby, Field), and an Opponency against\r\nJeffries on Nov. 7. I attended the Questionists' Examinations. I seem\r\nto have lived a very comfortable idle life. The Commemoration Day was\r\nDec. 18th, when I received a Prize, and the next day I walked to\r\nBury. On Jan. 4th, 1823, I returned to Cambridge, and until the\r\nB.A. Examination I read novels and played cards more than at any other\r\ntime in College.\r\n\r\n\"On Thursday, Jan. 9th, 1823, the preliminary classes, for arrangement\r\nof details of the B.A. Examination, were published. The first class,\r\nAiry, Drinkwater, Jeffries, Mason. As far as I remember, the rule was\r\nthen, that on certain days the classes were grouped (in regard to\r\nidentity of questions given to each group) thus: 1st, {2nd/3rd},\r\n{4th/5th} &c., and on certain other days thus: {1st/2nd}, {3rd/4th},\r\n&c. On Saturday, Jan. 11th, I paid fees. On Monday, Jan. 13th, the\r\nproceedings of examination began by a breakfast in the Combination\r\nRoom. After this, Gibson gave me breakfast every day, and Buckle gave\r\nme and some others a glass of wine after dinner. The hours were sharp,\r\nthe season a cold one, and no fire was allowed in the Senate House\r\nwhere the Examination was carried on (my place was in the East\r\ngallery), and altogether it was a severe time.\r\n\r\n\"The course of Examination was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Monday, Jan. 13th. 8 to 9, printed paper of questions by Mr Hind\r\n(moderator); half-past 9 to 11, questions given orally; 1 to 3, ditto;\r\n6 to 9, paper of problems at Mr Higman's rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, Jan. 14th. 8 to 9, Higman's paper; half-past 9 to 11,\r\nquestions given orally; 1 to 3, ditto; 6 to 9, paper of problems in\r\nSidney College Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, Jan. 15th. Questions given orally 8 to 9 and 1 to 3, with\r\npaper of questions on Paley and Locke (one question only in each was\r\nanswered).\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, Jan. 16th. We went in at 9 and 1, but there seems to have\r\nbeen little serious examination.\r\n\r\n\"Friday, Jan. 17. On this day the brackets or classes as resulting\r\nfrom the examination were published, 1st bracket Airy, 2nd bracket\r\nJeffries, 3rd bracket Drinkwater, Fisher, Foley, Mason, Myers.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday, Jan. 18th, the degrees were conferred in the usual\r\nway. It had been arranged that my brother and sister should come to\r\nsee me take my degree of B.A., and I had asked Gibson to conduct them\r\nto the Senate House Gallery: but Mr Hawkes (a Trinity Fellow) found\r\nthem and stationed them at the upper end of the Senate House. After\r\nthe preliminary arrangements of papers at the Vice-Chancellor's table,\r\nI, as Senior Wrangler, was led up first to receive the degree, and\r\nrarely has the Senate House rung with such applause as then filled\r\nit. For many minutes, after I was brought in front of the\r\nVice-Chancellor, it was impossible to proceed with the ceremony on\r\naccount of the uproar. I gave notice to the Smith's Prize Electors of\r\nmy intention to 'sit' for that prize, and dined at Rothman's rooms\r\nwith Drinkwater, Buckle, and others. On Monday, Jan. 20th, I was\r\nexamined by Professor Woodhouse, for Smith's Prize, from 10 to 1. I\r\nthink that the only competitor was Jeffries. On Tuesday I was examined\r\nby Prof. Turton, 10 to 1, and on Wednesday by Prof. Lax, 10 to 1. On\r\nThursday, Jan. 23rd, I went to Bury by coach, on one of the coldest\r\nevenings that I ever felt.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Peacock had once recommended me to sit for the Chancellor's medal\r\n(Classical Prize). But he now seemed to be cool in his advice, and I\r\nlaid aside all thought of it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seems not out of place to insert here a copy of some \"Cambridge\r\nReminiscences\" written by Airy, which will serve to explain the Acts\r\nand Opponencies referred to in the previous narrative, and other\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE ACTS.\r\n\r\nThe examination for B.A. degrees was preceded, in my time, by keeping\r\ntwo Acts, in the Schools under the University Library: the second of\r\nthem in the October term immediately before the examination; the first\r\n(I think) in the October term of the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThese Acts were reliques of the Disputations of the Middle Ages, which\r\nprobably held a very important place in the discipline of the\r\nUniversity. (There seems to be something like them in some of the\r\nContinental Universities.)  The presiding authority was one of the\r\nModerators. I apprehend that the word \"Moderator\" signified\r\n\"President,\" in which sense it is still used in the Kirk of Scotland;\r\nand that it was peculiarly applied to the Presidency of the\r\nDisputations, the most important educational arrangement in the\r\nUniversity. The Moderator sent a summons to the \"Respondent\" to submit\r\nthree subjects for argument, and to prepare to defend them on a given\r\nday: he also named three Opponents. This and all the following\r\nproceedings were conducted in Latin. For my Act of 1822, Nov. 6, I\r\nsubmitted the following subjects:\r\n\r\n\"Recte statuit Newtonus in Principiis suis Mathematicis, libro primo,\r\nsectione undecimâ.\"\r\n\r\n\"Recte statuit Woodius de Iride.\"\r\n\r\n\"Recte statuit Paleius de Obligationibus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Opponents named to attack these assertions were Hamilton of St\r\nJohn's, Rusby of St Catharine's, Field of Trinity. It was customary\r\nfor the Opponents to meet at tea at the rooms of the Senior Opponent,\r\nin order to discuss and arrange their arguments; the Respondent was\r\nalso invited, but he was warned that he must depart as soon as tea\r\nwould be finished: then the three Opponents proceeded with their\r\noccupation. As I have acted in both capacities, I am able to say that\r\nthe matter was transacted in an earnest and business-like way. Indeed\r\nin the time preceding my own (I know not whether in my own time) the\r\nassistance of a private tutor was frequently engaged, and I remember\r\nhearing a senior M.A. remark that my College Tutor (James D. Hustler)\r\nwas the best crammer for an Act in the University.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time, the parties met in the Schools: the Respondent\r\nfirst read a Latin Thesis on any subject (I think I took some\r\nmetaphysical subject), but nobody paid any attention to it: then the\r\nRespondent read his first Dogma, and the first Opponent produced an\r\nargument against it, in Latin. After this there were repeated replies\r\nand rejoinders, all in vivâ voce Latin, the Moderator sometimes\r\ninterposing a remark in Latin. When he considered that one argument\r\nwas disposed of, he called for another by the words \"Probes aliter.\"\r\nThe arguments were sometimes shaped with considerable ingenuity, and\r\nrequired a clear head in the Respondent. When all was finished, the\r\nModerator made a complimentary remark to the Respondent and one to the\r\nfirst Opponent (I forget whether to the second and third). In my\r\nRespondency of 1822, November 6, the compliment was, \"Quaestiones tuas\r\nsummo ingenio et acumine defendisti, et in rebus mathematicis\r\nscientiam planè mirabilem ostendisti.\"  In an Opponency (I forget\r\nwhen) the compliment was, \"Magno ingenio argumenta tua et construxisti\r\net defendisti.\"\r\n\r\nThe Acts of the high men excited much interest among the students. At\r\nmy Acts the room was crowded with undergraduates.\r\n\r\nI imagine that, at a time somewhat distant, the maintenance of the\r\nActs was the only regulation by which the University acted on the\r\nstudies of the place. When the Acts had been properly kept, license\r\nwas given to the Father of the College to present the undergraduate to\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor, who then solemnly admitted him \"ad respondendum\r\nQuaestioni.\" There is no appearance of collective examination before\r\nthis presentation: what the \"Quaestio\" might be, I do not know. Still\r\nthe undergraduate was not B.A. The Quaestio however was finished and\r\napproved before the day of a certain Congregation, and then the\r\nundergraduate was declared to be \"actualiter in artibus Baccalaureum.\"\r\n\r\nProbably these regulations were found to be insufficient for the\r\ncontrol of education, and the January examination was instituted. I\r\nconjecture this to have been at or shortly before the date of the\r\nearliest Triposes recorded in the Cambridge Calendar, 1748.\r\n\r\nThe increasing importance of the January examination naturally\r\ndiminished the value of the Acts in the eyes of the undergraduates;\r\nand, a few years after my M.A. degree, it was found that the Opponents\r\nmet, not for the purpose of concealing their arguments from the\r\nRespondent, but for the purpose of revealing them to him. This led to\r\nthe entire suppression of the system. The most active man in this\r\nsuppression was Mr Whewell: its date must have been near to 1830.\r\n\r\nThe shape in which the arguments were delivered by an Opponent,\r\nreading from a written paper, was, \"Si (quoting something from the\r\nRespondent's challenge), &c., &c. Cadit Quaestio; Sed (citing\r\nsomething else bearing on the subject of discussion), Valet\r\nConsequentia; Ergo (combining these to prove some inaccuracy in the\r\nRespondent's challenge), Valent Consequentia et Argumentum.\" Nobody\r\npretended to understand these mystical terminations.\r\n\r\nApparently the original idea was that several Acts should be kept by\r\neach undergraduate; for, to keep up the number (as it seemed), each\r\nstudent had to gabble through a ridiculous form \"Si quaestiones tuae\r\nfalsae sint, Cadit Quaestio:--sed quaestiones tuae falsae sunt, Ergo\r\nvalent Consequentia et Argumentum.\"  I have forgotten time and place\r\nwhen this was uttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE SENATE-HOUSE EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nThe Questionists, as the undergraduates preparing for B.A. were called\r\nin the October term, were considered as a separate body; collected at\r\na separate table in Hall, attending no lectures, but invited to attend\r\na system of trial examinations conducted by one of the Tutors or\r\nAssistant-Tutors.\r\n\r\nFrom the Acts, from the annual College examinations, and (I suppose)\r\nfrom enquiries in the separate Colleges, the Moderators acquired a\r\ngeneral idea of the relative merits of the candidates for\r\nhonours. Guided by this, the candidates were divided into six\r\nclasses. The Moderators and Assistant Examiners were provided each\r\nwith a set of questions in manuscript (no printed papers were used for\r\nHonours in the Senate House; in regard to the [Greek: hoi polloi] I\r\ncannot say). On the Monday on which the examination began, the Father\r\nof the College received all the Questionists (I believe), at any rate\r\nall the candidates for honours, at breakfast in the Combination Room\r\nat 8 o'clock, and marched them to the Senate House. My place with\r\nother honour-men was in the East Gallery. There one Examiner took\r\ncharge of the 1st and 2nd classes united, another Examiner took the\r\n3rd and 4th classes united, and a third took the 5th and 6th\r\nunited. On Tuesday, one Examiner took the 1st class alone, a second\r\ntook the 2nd and 3rd classes united, a third took the 4th and 5th\r\nclasses united, and a fourth took the 6th class alone. On Wednesday,\r\nThursday, and Friday the changes were similar. And, in all, the\r\nquestioning was thus conducted. The Examiner read from his manuscript\r\nthe first question. Those who could answer it proceeded to write out\r\ntheir answers, and as soon as one had finished he gave the word\r\n\"Done\"; then the Examiner read out his second question, repeating it\r\nwhen necessary for the understanding by those who took it up more\r\nlately. And so on. I think that the same process was repeated in the\r\nafternoon; but I do not remember precisely. In this manner the\r\nExamination was conducted through five days (Monday to Friday) with no\r\ninterruption except on Friday afternoon. It was principally, perhaps\r\nentirely, bookwork.\r\n\r\nBut on two _evenings_ there were printed papers of problems: and the\r\nexamination in these was conducted just as in the printed papers of\r\nthe present day: but in the private College Rooms of the\r\nModerators. And there, wine and other refreshments were offered to the\r\nExaminees. How this singular custom began, I know not.\r\n\r\nThe order of merit was worked out on Friday afternoon and evening, and\r\nwas in some measure known through the University late in the\r\nevening. I remember Mr Peacock coming to a party of Examinees and\r\ngiving information on several places. I do not remember his mentioning\r\nmine (though undoubtedly he did) but I distinctly remember his giving\r\nthe Wooden Spoon. On the Saturday morning at 8 o'clock the manuscript\r\nlist was nailed to the door of the Senate-House. The form of further\r\nproceedings in the presentation for degree (ad respondendum\r\nquaestioni) I imagine has not been much altered. The kneeling before\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor and placing hands in the Vice-Chancellor's hands\r\nwere those of the old form of doing homage.\r\n\r\nThe form of examination which I have described was complicated and\r\nperhaps troublesome, but I believe that it was very efficient,\r\npossibly more so than the modern form (established I suppose at the\r\nsame time as the abolition of the Acts). The proportion of questions\r\nnow answered to the whole number set is ridiculously small, and no\r\naccurate idea of relative merit can be formed from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE COLLEGE HALL.\r\n\r\nWhen I went up in 1819, and for several years later, the dinner was at\r\n1/4 past 3. There was no supplementary dinner for special\r\ndemands. Boat-clubs I think were not invented, even in a plain social\r\nway, till about 1824 or 1825; and not in connection with the College\r\ntill some years later. Some of the senior Fellows spoke of the time\r\nwhen dinner was at 2, and regretted the change.\r\n\r\nThere was supper in Hall at 9 o'clock: I have known it to be attended\r\nby a few undergraduates when tired by examinations or by evening\r\nwalks; and there were always some seniors at the upper table: I have\r\noccasionally joined them, and have had some very interesting\r\nconversations. The supper was cold, but hot additions were made when\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nOne little arrangement amused me, as shewing the ecclesiastical\r\ncharacter of the College. The Fasts of the Church were to be strictly\r\nkept, and there was to be no dinner in Hall. It was thus arranged. The\r\nevening chapel service, which was usually at 5-1/2 (I think), was held\r\nat 3; and at 4 the ordinary full meal was served in Hall, but as it\r\nfollowed the chapel attendance it was held to be supper; and there was\r\nno subsequent meal.\r\n\r\nThere were no chairs whatever in Hall, except the single chair of the\r\nvice-master at the head of the table on the dais and that of the\r\nsenior dean at the table next the East wall. All others sat on\r\nbenches. And I have heard allusions to a ludicrous difficulty which\r\noccurred when some princesses (of the Royal Family) dined in the Hall,\r\nand it was a great puzzle how to get them to the right side of the\r\nbenches.\r\n\r\nThe Sizars dined after all the rest; their dinner usually began soon\r\nafter 4. For the non-foundationists a separate dinner was provided, as\r\nfor pensioners. But for the foundationists, the remains of the\r\nFellows' dinner were brought down; and I think that this provision was\r\ngenerally preferred to the other.\r\n\r\nThe dishes at all the tables of undergraduates were of pewter, till a\r\ncertain day when they were changed for porcelain. I cannot remember\r\nwhether this was at the time when they became Questionists (in the\r\nOctober Term), or at the time when they were declared \"actualiter esse\r\nin artibus Baccalaureos\" (in the Lent Term).\r\n\r\nUp to the Questionist time the undergraduate Scholars had no mixture\r\nwhatever; they were the only pure table in the Hall: and I looked on\r\nthis as a matter very valuable for the ultimate state of the College\r\nsociety. But in the October term, those who were to proceed to\r\nB.A. were drafted into the mixed body of Questionists: and they\r\ngreatly disliked the change. They continued so till the Lent Term,\r\nwhen they were formally invited by the Bachelor Scholars to join the\r\nupper table.\r\n\r\n\r\n           MATHEMATICAL SUBJECTS OF STUDY AND EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nIn the October Term 1819, the only books on Pure Mathematics\r\nwere:--Euclid generally, Algebra by Dr Wood (formerly Tutor, but in\r\n1819 Master, of St John's College), Vince's Fluxions and Dealtry's\r\nFluxions, Woodhouse's and other Trigonometries. Not a whisper passed\r\nthrough the University generally on the subject of Differential\r\nCalculus; although some papers (subsequently much valued) on that\r\nsubject had been written by Mr Woodhouse, fellow of Caius College; but\r\ntheir style was repulsive, and they never took hold of the\r\nUniversity. Whewell's Mechanics (1819) contains a few and easy\r\napplications of the Differential Calculus. The books on applied\r\nMathematics were Wood's Mechanics, Whewell's Mechanics, Wood's Optics,\r\nVince's Hydrostatics, Vince's Astronomy, Woodhouse's Plane Astronomy\r\n(perhaps rather later), The First Book of Newton's Principia: I do not\r\nremember any others. These works were undoubtedly able; and for the\r\ngreat proportion of University students going into active life, I do\r\nnot conceal my opinion that books constructed on the principles of\r\nthose which I have cited were more useful than those exclusively\r\nfounded on the more modern system. For those students who aimed at the\r\nmastery of results more difficult and (in the intellectual sense) more\r\nimportant, the older books were quite insufficient. More aspiring\r\nstudents read, and generally with much care, several parts of Newton's\r\nPrincipia, Book I., and also Book III. (perhaps the noblest example\r\nof geometrical form of cosmical theory that the world has seen). I\r\nremember some questions from Book III. proposed in the Senate-House\r\nExamination 1823.\r\n\r\nIn the October term 1819, I went up to the University. The works of\r\nWood and Vince, which I have mentioned, still occupied the\r\nlecture-rooms. But a great change was in preparation for the\r\nUniversity Course of Mathematics. During the great Continental war,\r\nthe intercourse between men of science in England and in France had\r\nbeen most insignificant. But in the autumn of 1819, three members of\r\nthe Senate (John Herschel, George Peacock, and Charles Babbage) had\r\nentered into the mathematical society of Paris, and brought away some\r\nof the works on Pure Mathematics (especially those of Lacroix) and on\r\nMechanics (principally Poisson's). In 1820 they made a translation of\r\nLacroix's Differential Calculus; and they prepared a volume of\r\nExamples of the Differential and Integral Calculus. These were\r\nextensively studied: but the form of the College Examinations or the\r\nUniversity Examinations was not, I think, influenced by them in the\r\nwinter 1820-1821 or the two following terms. But in the winter\r\n1821-1822 Peacock was one of the Moderators; and in the Senate-House\r\nExamination, January 1822, he boldly proposed a Paper of important\r\nquestions entirely in the Differential Calculus. This was considered\r\nas establishing the new system in the University. In January 1823, I\r\nthink the two systems were mingled. Though I was myself subject to\r\nthat examination, I grieve to say that I have forgotten much of the\r\ndetails, except that I well remember that some of the questions\r\nreferred to Newton, Book III. on the Lunar Theory. To these I have\r\nalready alluded.\r\n\r\nNo other work occurs to me as worthy of mention, except Woodhouse's\r\nLunar Theory, entirely founded on the Differential Calculus. The style\r\nof this book was not attractive, and it was very little read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n            AT TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, FROM HIS TAKING\r\n             HIS B.A. DEGREE TO HIS TAKING CHARGE OF THE\r\n             CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY AS PLUMIAN PROFESSOR.\r\n\r\n            FROM JANUARY 18TH, 1823, TO MARCH 15TH, 1828.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 30th, 1823, I returned to Cambridge. I had already heard that\r\nI had gained the 1st Smith's Prize, and one of the first notifications\r\nto me on my return was that the Walker's good-conduct prize of _£10_\r\nwas awarded to me.\r\n\r\n\"I remember that my return was not very pleasant, for our table in\r\nhall was half occupied by a set of irregular men who had lost terms\r\nand were obliged to reside somewhat longer in order to receive the\r\nB.A. degree. But at the time of my completing the B.A. degree (which\r\nis not till some weeks after the examination and admission) I with the\r\nother complete bachelors was duly invited to the table of the B.A.\r\nscholars, and that annoyance ended.\r\n\r\n\"The liberation from undergraduate study left me at liberty generally\r\nto pursue my own course (except so far as it was influenced by the\r\npreparation for fellowship examination), and also left me at liberty\r\nto earn more money, in the way usual with the graduates, by taking\r\nundergraduate pupils. Mr Peacock recommended me to take only four,\r\nwhich occupied me four hours every day, and for each of them I\r\nreceived 20 guineas each term. My first pupils, for the Lent and\r\nEaster terms, were Williamson (afterwards Head Master of Westminster\r\nSchool), James Parker (afterwards Q.C. and Vice-Chancellor), Bissett,\r\nand Clinton of Caius. To all these I had been engaged before taking my\r\nB.A. degree.\r\n\r\n\"I kept up classical subjects. I have a set of notes on the [Greek:\r\nPloutos] and [Greek: Nephelai] of Aristophanes, finished on Mar. 15th,\r\n1823, and I began my daily writing of Latin as usual on Feb. 8th. In\r\nmathematics I worked very hard at Lunar and Planetary Theories. I have\r\ntwo MS. books of Lunar Theory to the 5th order of small quantities,\r\nwhich however answered no purpose except that of making me perfectly\r\nfamiliar with that subject. I worked well, upon my quires, the figure\r\nof Saturn supposed homogeneous as affected by the attraction of his\r\nring, and the figure of the Earth as heterogeneous, and the Calculus\r\nof Variations. I think it was now that I wrote a MS. on constrained\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\"On Mar. 17th, 1823, I was elected Fellow of the Cambridge\r\nPhilosophical Society. On May 9th a cast of my head was taken for Dr\r\nElliotson, an active phrenologist, by Deville, a tradesman in the\r\nStrand.\r\n\r\n\"I had long thought that I should like to visit Scotland, and on my\r\nonce saying so to my mother, she (who had a most kindly recollection\r\nof Alnwick) said in a few words that she thought I could not do\r\nbetter. I had therefore for some time past fully determined that as\r\nsoon as I had sufficient spare time and money enough I would go to\r\nScotland. The interval between the end of Easter Term and the usual\r\nbeginning with pupils in the Long Vacation offered sufficient time,\r\nand I had now earned a little money, and I therefore determined to go,\r\nand invited my sister to accompany me. I had no private\r\nintroductions, except one from James Parker to Mr Reach, a writer of\r\nInverness: some which Drinkwater sent being too late. On May 20th we\r\nwent by coach to Stamford; thence by Pontefract and Oulton to York,\r\nwhere I saw the Cathedral, which _then_ disappointed me, but I suppose\r\nthat we were tired with the night journey. Then by Newcastle to\r\nAlnwick, where we stopped for the day to see my birthplace. On May\r\n24th to Edinburgh. On this journey I remember well the stone walls\r\nbetween the fields, the place (in Yorkshire) where for the first time\r\nin my life I saw rock, the Hambleton, Kyloe, Cheviot and Pentland\r\nHills, Arthur's Seat, but still more strikingly the revolving Inch\r\nKeith Light. At Edinburgh I hired a horse and gig for our journey in\r\nScotland, and we drove by Queensferry to Kinross (where for the first\r\ntime in my life I saw clouds on the hills, viz. on the Lomond Hills),\r\nand so to Perth. Thence by Dunkeld and Killicrankie to Blair Athol\r\n(the dreariness of the Drumochter Pass made a strong impression on\r\nme), and by Aviemore (where I saw snow on the mountains) to\r\nInverness. Here we received much kindness and attention from Mr Reach,\r\nand after visiting the Falls of Foyers and other sights we went to\r\nFort Augustus and Fort William. We ascended Ben Nevis, on which there\r\nwas a great deal of snow, and visited the vitrified fort in Glen\r\nNevis. Then by Inverary to Tarbet, and ascended Ben Lomond, from\r\nwhence we had a magnificent view. We then passed by Loch Achray to\r\nGlasgow, where we found James Parker's brother (his father, of the\r\nhouse of Macinroy and Parker, being a wealthy merchant of Glasgow). On\r\nJune 15th to Mr Parker's house at Blochairn, near Glasgow (on this day\r\nI heard Dr Chalmers preach), and on the 17th went with the family by\r\nsteamer (the first that I had seen) to Fairly, near Largs. I returned\r\nthe gig to Edinburgh, visited Arran and Bute, and we then went by\r\ncoach to Carlisle, and by Penrith to Keswick (by the old road: never\r\nshall I forget the beauty of the approach to Keswick). After visiting\r\nAmbleside and Kendal we returned to Cambridge by way of Leeds, and\r\nposted to Bury on the 28th June. The expense of this expedition was\r\nabout _£81_. It opened a completely new world to me.\r\n\r\n\"I had little time to rest at Bury. In the preceding term Drinkwater,\r\nBuckle, and myself, had engaged to go somewhere into the country with\r\npupils during the Long Vacation (as was customary with Cambridge\r\nmen). Buckle however changed his mind. Drinkwater went to look for a\r\nplace, fixed on Swansea, and engaged a house (called the Cambrian\r\nHotel, kept by a Captain Jenkins). On the morning of July 2nd I left\r\nBury for London and by mail coach to Bristol. On the morning of July\r\n3rd by steamer to Swansea, and arrived late at night. I had then five\r\npupils: Parker, Harman Lewis (afterwards Professor in King's College,\r\nLondon), Pierce Morton, Gibson, and Guest of Caius (afterwards Master\r\nof the College). Drinkwater had four, viz. two Malkins (from Bury),\r\nElphinstone (afterwards M.P.), and Farish (son of Professor\r\nFarish). We lived a hard-working strange life. My pupils began with me\r\nat six in the morning: I was myself reading busily. We lived\r\ncompletely _en famille_, with two men-servants besides the house\r\nestablishment. One of our first acts was to order a four-oared boat to\r\nbe built, fitted with a lug-sail: she was called the Granta of\r\nSwansea. In the meantime we made sea excursions with boats borrowed\r\nfrom ships in the port. On July 23rd, with a borrowed boat, we went\r\nout when the sea was high, but soon found our boat unmanageable, and\r\nat last got into a place where the sea was breaking heavily over a\r\nshoal, and the two of the crew who were nearest to me (A. Malkin and\r\nLewis), one on each side, were carried out: they were good swimmers\r\nand we recovered them, though with some trouble: the breaker had\r\npassed quite over my head: we gained the shore and the boat was taken\r\nhome by land. When our own boat was finished, we had some most\r\npicturesque adventures at the Mumbles, Aberavon, Caswell Bay,\r\nIlfracombe, and Tenby. From all this I learnt navigation pretty\r\nwell. The mixture of hard study and open-air exertion seemed to affect\r\nthe health of several of us (I was one): we were covered with painful\r\nboils.\r\n\r\n\"My Latin-writing began again on July 25th: I have notes on\r\nDemosthenes, Lucretius, and Greek History. In mathematics I find\r\nChances, Figure of the Earth with variable density, Differential\r\nEquations, Partial Differentials, sketch for an instrument for shewing\r\nrefraction, and Optical instruments with effects of chromatic\r\naberration. In August there occurred an absurd quarrel between the\r\nFellows of Trinity and the undergraduates, on the occasion of\r\ncommencing the building of King's Court, when the undergraduates were\r\nnot invited to wine, and absented themselves from the hall.\r\n\r\n\"There were vacant this year (1823) five fellowships in Trinity\r\nCollege. In general, the B.A.'s of the first year are not allowed to\r\nsit for fellowships: but this year it was thought so probable that\r\npermission would be given, that on Sept. 2nd Mr Higman, then appointed\r\nas Tutor to a third 'side' of the College, wrote to me to engage me as\r\nAssistant Mathematical Tutor in the event of my being elected a Fellow\r\non Oct. 1st, and I provisionally engaged myself. About the same time\r\nI had written to Mr Peacock, who recommended me to sit, and to Mr\r\nWhewell, who after consultation with the Master (Dr Wordsworth),\r\ndiscouraged it. As there was no absolute prohibition, I left Swansea\r\non Sept. 11th (before my engagement to my pupils was quite finished)\r\nand returned to Cambridge by Gloucester, Oxford, and London. I gave in\r\nmy name at the butteries as candidate for fellowship, but was informed\r\nin a day or two that I should not be allowed to sit. On Sept. 19th I\r\nwalked to Bury.\r\n\r\n\"I walked back to Cambridge on Oct. 17th, 1823. During this October\r\nterm I had four pupils: Neate, Cankrein, Turner (afterwards 2nd\r\nwrangler and Treasurer of Guy's Hospital), and William Hervey (son of\r\nthe Marquis of Bristol). In the Lent term I had four (Neate, Cankrein,\r\nTurner, Clinton). In the Easter term I had three (Neate, Cankrein,\r\nTurner).\r\n\r\n\"My daily writing of Latin commenced on Oct. 27th. In November I began\r\nre-reading Sophocles with my usual care. In mathematics I find\r\ninvestigations of Motion in a resisting medium, Form of Saturn, Draft\r\nof a Paper about an instrument for exhibiting the fundamental law of\r\nrefraction (read at the Philosophical Society by Mr Peacock on\r\nNov. 10th, 1823), Optics, Solid Geometry, Figure of the Earth with\r\nvariable density, and much about attractions. I also in this term\r\nwrote a MS. on the Calculus of Variations, and one on Wood's Algebra,\r\n2nd and 4th parts. I have also notes of the temperature of mines in\r\nCornwall, something on the light of oil-gas, and reminiscences of\r\nSwansea in a view of Oswick Bay. In November I attended Professor\r\nSedgwick's geological lectures.\r\n\r\n\"At some time in this term I had a letter from Mr South (to whom I\r\nsuppose I had written) regarding the difficulty of my telescope: he\r\nwas intimately acquainted with Tulley, and I suppose that thus the\r\nmatter had become more fully known to him. He then enquired if I could\r\nvisit him in the winter vacation. I accordingly went from Bury, and\r\nwas received by him at his house in Blackman Street for a week or more\r\nwith great kindness. He introduced me to Sir Humphrey Davy and many\r\nother London savans, and shewed me many London sights and the\r\nGreenwich Observatory. I also had a little practice with his own\r\ninstruments. He was then on intimate terms with Mr Herschel\r\n(afterwards Sir John Herschel), then living in London, who came\r\noccasionally to observe double stars. This was the first time that I\r\nsaw practical astronomy. It seems that I borrowed his mountain\r\nbarometer. In the Lent term I wrote to him regarding the deduction of\r\nthe parallax of Mars, from a comparison of the relative positions of\r\nMars and 46 Leonis, as observed by him and by Rumker at Paramatta. My\r\nworking is on loose papers. I see that I have worked out perfectly the\r\ninterpolations, the effects of uncertainty of longitude, &c., but I do\r\nnot see whether I have a final result.\r\n\r\n\"In Jan. 1824, at Playford, I was working on the effects of separating\r\nthe two lenses of an object-glass, and on the kind of eye-piece which\r\nwould be necessary: also on spherical aberrations and Saturn's\r\nfigure. On my quires at Cambridge I was working on the effects of\r\nseparating the object-glass lenses, with the view of correcting the\r\nsecondary spectrum: and on Jan. 31st I received some numbers (indices\r\nof refraction) from Mr Herschel, and reference to Fraunhofer's\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n\"About this time it was contemplated to add to the Royal Observatory\r\nof Greenwich two assistants of superior education. Whether this\r\nscheme was entertained by the Admiralty, the Board of Longitude, or\r\nthe Royal Society, I do not know. Somehow (I think through Mr\r\nPeacock) a message from Mr Herschel was conveyed to me, acquainting me\r\nof this, and suggesting that I should be an excellent person for the\r\nprincipal place. To procure information, I went to London on Saturday,\r\nFeb. 7th, sleeping at Mr South's, to be present at one of Sir Humphrey\r\nDavy's Saturday evening soirées (they were then held every Saturday),\r\nand to enquire of Sir H. Davy and Dr Young. When I found that\r\nsuccession to the post of Astronomer Royal was not considered as\r\ndistinctly a consequence of it, I took it coolly, and returned the\r\nnext night. The whole proposal came to nothing.\r\n\r\n\"At this time I was engaged upon differential equations, mountain\r\nbarometer problem and determination of the height of the Gogmagogs and\r\nseveral other points, investigations connected with Laplace's\r\ncalculus, spherical aberration in different planes, geology\r\n(especially regarding Derbyshire, which I proposed to visit), and much\r\nof optics. I wrote a draft of my Paper on the figure of Saturn, and on\r\nMar. 15th, 1824, it was read at the Philosophical Society under the\r\ntitle of 'On the figure assumed by a fluid homogeneous mass, whose\r\nparticles are acted on by their mutual attraction, and by small\r\nextraneous forces,' and is printed in their Memoirs. I also wrote a\r\ndraft of my Paper on Achromatic Eye-pieces, and on May 17th, 1824, it\r\nwas read at the Philosophical Society under the title of 'On the\r\nPrinciples and Construction of the Achromatic Eye-pieces of\r\nTelescopes, and on the Achromatism of Microscopes,' including also the\r\neffects of separating the lenses of the object-glass. It is printed in\r\ntheir Memoirs.\r\n\r\n\"Amongst miscellaneous matters I find that on Mar. 22nd of this year I\r\nbegan regularly making extracts from the books of the Book Society, a\r\npractice which I continued to March 1826. On Mar. 27th, a very rainy\r\nday, I walked to Bury to attend the funeral of my uncle William\r\nBiddell, near Diss, and on Mar. 30th I walked back in rain and\r\nsnow. On Feb. 24th I dined with Cubitt in Cambridge. On May 21st I\r\ngave a certificate to Rogers (the assistant in Crosse's school, and my\r\ninstructor in mathematics), which my mother amplified much, and which\r\nI believe procured his election as master of Walsall School. On June\r\n23rd I went to Bury. The speeches at Bury School, which I wished to\r\nattend, took place next day.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point of his Autobiography the writer continues, \"Now came one\r\nof the most important occurrences in my life.\" The important event in\r\nquestion was his acquaintance with Richarda Smith, the lady who\r\nafterwards became his wife. The courtship was a long one, and in the\r\nAutobiography there are various passages relating to it, all written\r\nin the most natural and unaffected manner, but of somewhat too private\r\na nature for publication. It will therefore be convenient to digress\r\nfrom the straight path of the narrative in order to insert a short\r\nmemoir of the lady who was destined to influence his life and\r\nhappiness in a most important degree.\r\n\r\nRicharda Smith was the eldest daughter of the Rev. Richard Smith, who\r\nhad been a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, but was at this time\r\nPrivate Chaplain to the Duke of Devonshire, and held the small living\r\nof Edensor, near Chatsworth, in Derbyshire. He had a family of two\r\nsons and seven daughters, whom he had brought up and educated very\r\ncarefully. Several of his daughters were remarkable both for their\r\nbeauty and accomplishments. Richarda Smith was now in her 20th year,\r\nand the writer of the Autobiography records that \"at Matlock we\r\nreceived great attention from Mr Chenery: in speaking of Mr Smith I\r\nremember his saying that Mr Smith had a daughter whom the Duke of\r\nDevonshire declared to be the most beautiful girl he ever saw.\" This\r\nwas before he had made the acquaintance of the family. Airy was at\r\nthis time on a walking tour in Derbyshire with his brother William,\r\nand they were received at Edensor by Mr Smith, to whom he had letters\r\nof introduction. He seems to have fallen in love with Miss Smith \"at\r\nfirst sight,\" and within two days of first seeing her he made her an\r\noffer of marriage. Neither his means nor his prospects at that time\r\npermitted the least idea of an immediate marriage, and Mr Smith would\r\nnot hear of any engagement. But he never had the least doubt as to\r\nthe wisdom of the choice that he had made: he worked steadily on,\r\nwinning fame and position, and recommending his suit from time to time\r\nto Miss Smith as opportunity offered, and finally married her, nearly\r\nsix years after his first proposal. His constancy had its reward, for\r\nhe gained a most charming and affectionate wife. As he records at the\r\ntime of his marriage, \"My wife was aged between 25 and 26, but she\r\nscarcely appeared more than 18 or 20. Her beauty and accomplishments,\r\nher skill and fidelity in sketching, and above all her exquisite\r\nsinging of ballads, made a great sensation in Cambridge.\"\r\n\r\nTheir married life lasted 45 years, but the last six years were\r\nsaddened by the partial paralysis and serious illness of Lady\r\nAiry. The entire correspondence between them was most carefully\r\npreserved, and is a record of a most happy union. The letters were\r\nwritten during his numerous journeys and excursions on business or\r\npleasure, and it is evident that his thoughts were with her from the\r\nmoment of their parting. Every opportunity of writing was seized with\r\nan energy and avidity that shewed how much his heart was in the\r\ncorrespondence. Nothing was too trivial or too important to\r\ncommunicate to his wife, whether relating to family or business\r\nmatters. The letters on both sides are always full of affection and\r\nsympathy, and are written in that spirit of confidence which arises\r\nfrom a deep sense of the value and necessity of mutual support in the\r\ntroubles of life. And with his active and varied employments and his\r\nnumerous family there was no lack of troubles. They were both of them\r\nsimple-minded, sensible, and practical people, and were very grateful\r\nfor such comforts and advantages as they were able to command, but for\r\nnothing in comparison with their deep respect and affection for one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBoth by natural ability and education she was well qualified to enter\r\ninto the pursuits of her husband, and in many cases to assist him. She\r\nalways welcomed her husband's friends, and by her skill and attractive\r\ncourtesy kept them well together. She was an admirable letter-writer,\r\nand in the midst of her numerous domestic distractions always found\r\ntime for the duties of correspondence. In conversation she was very\r\nattractive, not so much from the wit or brilliancy of her remarks as\r\nfrom the brightness and interest with which she entered into the\r\ntopics under discussion, and from the unfailing grace and courtesy\r\nwith which she attended to the views of others. This was especially\r\nrecognized by the foreign astronomers and men of science who from time\r\nto time stayed as guests at the Observatory and to whom she acted as\r\nhostess. Although she was not an accomplished linguist yet she was\r\nwell able to express herself in French and German, and her natural\r\ngood sense and kindliness placed her guests at their ease, and made\r\nthem feel themselves (as indeed they were) welcomed and at home.\r\n\r\nHer father, the Rev. Richard Smith, was a man of most cultivated mind,\r\nand of the highest principles, with a keen enjoyment of good society,\r\nwhich the confidence and friendship of his patron the Duke of\r\nDevonshire amply secured to him, both at Chatsworth and in London. He\r\nhad a deep attachment to his Alma Mater of Cambridge, and though not\r\nhimself a mathematician he had a great respect for the science of\r\nmathematics and for eminent mathematicians. During the long courtship\r\nalready related Mr Smith conceived the highest respect for Airy's\r\ncharacter, as well as for his great repute and attainments, and\r\nexpressed his lively satisfaction at his daughter's marriage. Thus on\r\nJanuary 20th, 1830, he wrote to his intended son-in-law as follows: \"I\r\nhave little else to say to you than that I continue with heartfelt\r\nsatisfaction to reflect on the important change about to take place in\r\nmy dear daughter's situation. A father must not allow himself to\r\ndilate on such a subject: of course I feel confident that you will\r\nhave no reason to repent the irrevocable step you have taken, but from\r\nthe manner in which Richarda has been brought up, you will find such a\r\nhelpmate in her as a man of sense and affection would wish to have,\r\nand that she is well prepared to meet the duties and trials (for such\r\nmust be met with) of domestic life with a firm and cultivated mind,\r\nand the warm feelings of a kind heart. Her habits are such as by no\r\nmeans to lead her to expensive wishes, nor will you I trust ever find\r\nit necessary to neglect those studies and pursuits upon which your\r\nreputation and subsistence are chiefly founded, to seek for idle\r\namusements for your companion. I must indulge no further in speaking\r\nof her, and have only at present to add that I commit in full\r\nconfidence into your hands the guardianship of my daughter's\r\nhappiness.\" And on April 5th, 1830, shortly after their marriage, he\r\nwrote to his daughter thus: \"If thinking of you could supply your\r\nplace amongst us you would have been with us unceasingly, for we have\r\nall of us made you the principal object of our thoughts and our talk\r\nsince you left us, and I travelled with you all your journey to your\r\npresent delightful home. We had all but one feeling of the purest\r\npleasure in the prospect of the true domestic comfort to which we\r\nfully believe you to be now gone, and we rejoice that all your\r\nendearing qualities will now be employed to promote the happiness of\r\none whom we think so worthy of them as your dear husband, who has left\r\nus in the best opinion of his good heart, as well as his enlightened\r\nand sound understanding. His late stay with us has endeared him to us\r\nall. Never did man enter into the married state from more honourable\r\nmotives, or from a heart more truly seeking the genuine happiness of\r\nthat state than Mr Airy, and he will, I trust, find his reward in you\r\nfrom all that a good wife can render to the best of husbands, and his\r\nhappiness be reflected on yourself.\" It would be difficult to find\r\nletters of more genuine feeling and satisfaction, or more eloquently\r\nexpressed, than these.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the Autobiography will now be resumed.\r\n\r\n\"I had been disappointed two years before of an expedition to\r\nDerbyshire. I had wished still to make it, and my brother wished to\r\ngo: and we determined to make it this year (1824). We were prepared\r\nwith walking dresses and knapsacks. I had well considered every detail\r\nof our route, and was well provided with letters of introduction,\r\nincluding one to the Rev. R. Smith of Edensor. On June 29th we started\r\nby coach to Newmarket and walked through the Fens by Ramsay to\r\nPeterborough. Then by Stamford and Ketton quarries to Leicester and\r\nDerby. Here we were recognized by a Mr Calvert, who had seen me take\r\nmy degree, and he invited us to breakfast, and employed himself in\r\nshewing us several manufactories, &c. to which we had been denied\r\naccess when presenting ourselves unsupported. We then went to Belper\r\nwith an introduction from Mr Calvert to Jedediah Strutt: saw the great\r\ncotton mills, and in the evening walked to Matlock. Up to this time\r\nthe country of greatest interest was the region of the fens about\r\nRamsay (a most remarkable district), but now began beauty of scenery.\r\nOn July 9th we walked by Rowsley and Haddon Hall over the hills to\r\nEdensor, where we stayed till the 12th with Mr Smith. We next visited\r\nHathersage, Castleton, and Marple (where I wished to see the canal\r\naqueduct), and went by coach to Manchester, and afterwards to\r\nLiverpool. Here Dr Traill recommended us to see the Pontycyssylte\r\nAqueduct, and we went by Chester and Wrexham to Rhuabon, saw the\r\nmagnificent work, and proceeded to Llangollen. Thence by Chester and\r\nNorthwich (where we descended a salt-mine) to Macclesfield. Then to\r\nthe Ecton mine (of which we saw but little) through Dovedale to\r\nAshbourn, and by coach to Derby. On July 24th to Birmingham, where we\r\nfound Mr Guest, lodged in his house, and were joined by my pupil\r\nGuest. Here we were fully employed in visiting the manufactures, and\r\nthen went into the iron country, where I descended a pit in the\r\nStaffordshire Main. Thence by coach to Cambridge, where I stopped to\r\nprepare for the Fellowship Examination.\r\n\r\n\"I had two pupils in this portion of the Long Vacation, Turner and\r\nDobbs. On August 2nd my writing of Latin began regularly as before. My\r\nprincipal mathematics on the quires are Optics. On August 25th I made\r\nexperiments on my left eye, with good measures, and on Aug. 26th\r\nordered a cylindrical lens of Peters, a silversmith in the town, which\r\nI believe was never made. Subsequently, while at Playford, I ordered\r\ncylindrical lenses of an artist named Fuller, living at Ipswich, and\r\nthese were completed in November, 1824.\r\n\r\n\"My letter to the Examiners, announcing my intention of sitting for\r\nFellowship (which like all other such documents is preserved on my\r\nquires) was delivered on Sept 21st. The Examination took place on\r\nSept. 22nd and the two following days. On Oct. 1st, 1824, at the usual\r\nhour of the morning, I was elected Fellow. There were elected at the\r\nsame time T.B. Macaulay (afterwards Lord Macaulay), who was a year\r\nsenior to me in College, and I think Field of my own year. I drew up\r\nmy letter of acknowledgment to the Electors. On Oct. 2nd at 9 in the\r\nmorning I was admitted Fellow with the usual ceremonies, and at 10 I\r\ncalled on the Electors with my letter of acknowledgment. I immediately\r\njourneyed to Derbyshire, paid a visit at Edensor, and returned by\r\nSheffield.\r\n\r\n\"On Oct. 11th (it having been understood with Mr Higman that my\r\nengagement as Assistant Mathematical Tutor stood) the Master sent for\r\nme to appoint me and to say what was expected as duty of the\r\noffice. He held out to me the prospect of ultimately succeeding to the\r\nTutorship, and I told him that I hoped to be out of College before\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n\"About this time the 'Athenaeum,' a club of a scientific character,\r\nwas established in London, and I was nominated on it, but I declined\"\r\n(Oct. 14th). In this year (1824) I commenced account with a banker by\r\nplacing _£110_ in the hands of Messrs Mortlock and Co. On Oct. 16th I\r\nwalked to Bury, and after a single day's stay there returned to\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n\"On Oct. 23rd, 1824,1 began my lectures as Mathematical Assistant\r\nTutor. I lectured the Senior Sophs and Junior Sophs on Higman's\r\nside. The number of Senior Sophs was 21. Besides this I took part in\r\nthe 'Examinations of the Questionists,' a series of exercises for\r\nthose who were to take the Bachelor's degree in the next January. I\r\nexamined in Mechanics, Newton, and Optics. I had also as private\r\npupils Turner, Dobbs, and Cooper. I now ceased from the exercise which\r\nI had followed with such regularity for five years, namely that of\r\ndaily writing Latin. In its stead I engaged a French Master (Goussel)\r\nwith whom I studied French with reasonable assiduity for the three\r\nterms to June, 1825.\r\n\r\n\"Among mathematical investigations I find: Theory of the Moon's\r\nbrightness, Motion of a body in an ellipse round two centres of force,\r\nVarious differential equations, Numerical computation of sin pi from\r\nseries, Numerical computation of sines of various arcs to 18 decimals,\r\nCurvature of surfaces in various directions, Generating functions,\r\nProblem of sound. I began in the winter a Latin Essay as competing\r\nfor the Middle Bachelors' Prize, but did not proceed with it. I\r\nafterwards wished that I had followed it up: but my time was fully\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 28th, 1825, I started for Edensor, where I paid a visit, and\r\nreturned on Feb. 2nd. On Feb. 4th I wrote to Mr Clarkson, asking his\r\nadvice about a profession or mode of life (the cares of life were now\r\nbeginning to press me heavily, and continued to do so for several\r\nyears). He replied very kindly, but his answer amounted to nothing.\r\nAbout the same time I had some conversation of the same kind with Mr\r\nPeacock, which was equally fruitless.\r\n\r\n\"On Feb. 4th I have investigations of the density of light near a\r\ncaustic (on the theory of emissions). On Feb. 5th I finished a Paper\r\nabout the defect in my eye, which was communicated to the Cambridge\r\nPhilosophical Society on Feb. 21st. Mr Peacock or Mr Whewell had some\r\ntime previously applied to me to write a Paper on Trigonometry for the\r\nEncyclopaedia Metropolitana, and I had been collecting some materials\r\n(especially in regard to its history) at every visit to London, where\r\nI read sometimes at the British Museum: also in the Cambridge\r\nlibraries. I began this Paper (roughly) on Feb. 8th, and finished it\r\non Mar. 3rd. The history of which I speak, by some odd management of\r\nthe Editors of the Encyclopaedia, was never published. The MS. is now\r\namongst the MSS. of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Other subjects\r\non my quires are: Theory of musical concords, many things relating to\r\ntrigonometry and trigonometrical tables, achromatic eye-pieces,\r\nequation to the surface bounding the rays that enter my left eye,\r\nexperiments on percussion. Also notes on Cumberland and Wales (I had\r\nalready proposed to myself to take a party of pupils in the Long\r\nVacation to Keswick), and notes on history and geology.\r\n\r\n\"I had been in correspondence with Dr Malkin (master of Bury School),\r\nwho on Feb. 8th sent a certificate for my brother William, whom I\r\nentered at Trinity on Peacock's side. On Mar. 25th I changed my rooms,\r\nquitting those on the ground-floor east side of Queen Mary's Gate for\r\nfirst-floor rooms in Neville's Court, south side, the easternmost\r\nrooms. In this term my lectures lasted from Apr. 18th to May\r\n14th. Apparently I had only the Senior Sophs, 19 in number, and the\r\nsame four pupils (Turner, Dobbs, Cooper, Hovenden) as in the preceding\r\nterm. The only scientific subjects on which I find notes are, a Paper\r\non the forms of the Teeth of Wheels, communicated to the Philosophical\r\nSociety on May 2nd; some notes about Musical Concords, and some\r\nexamination of a strange piece of Iceland Spar. On Apr. 29th I was\r\nelected to the Northern Institution (of Inverness); the first\r\ncompliment that I received from an extraneous body.\r\n\r\n\"On May 14th I have a most careful examination of my money accounts,\r\nto see whether I can make an expedition with my sister into Wales. My\r\nsister came to Cambridge, and on Monday, May 23rd, 1825, we started\r\nfor Wales, equipped in the lightest way for a walking expedition. We\r\nwent by Birmingham to Shrewsbury: then to the Pontycyssylte Aqueduct\r\nand by various places to Bala, and thence by Llanrwst to Conway. Here\r\nthe suspension bridge was under construction: the mole was made and\r\nthe piers, but nothing else. Then on to Bangor, where nine chains of\r\nthe suspension bridge were in place, and so to Holyhead. Then by\r\nCarnarvon to Bethgelert, ascending Snowdon by the way, and in\r\nsuccession by Festiniog, Dolgelly, and Aberystwyth to Hereford (the\r\nfirst time that I had visited it since my father left it). From thence\r\nwe went by coach to London, and I went on to Cambridge on the 23rd of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\"I had arranged to take a party of pupils to Keswick, and to take my\r\nbrother there. Mr Clarkson had provided me with introductions to Mr\r\nSouthey and Mr Wordsworth. On Wednesday, June 29th, 1825, we started,\r\nand went by Leicester, Sheffield, Leeds, and Kendal, to Keswick,\r\ncalling at Edensor on the way. My pupils were Cleasby, Marshman,\r\nClinton, Wigram, Tottenham, and M. Smith. At Keswick I passed three\r\nmonths very happily. I saw Mr Southey's family frequently, and Mr\r\nWordsworth's occasionally. By continual excursions in the\r\nneighbourhood, and by a few excursions to places as distant as\r\nBowness, Calder Bridge, &c. (always climbing the intermediate\r\nmountains), I became well acquainted with almost the whole of that\r\nbeautiful country, excepting some of the S. W. dales. A geological\r\nhammer and a mountain barometer were very interesting companions. I\r\nhad plenty of work with my pupils: I worked a little Lunar Theory, a\r\nlittle of Laplace's Equations, something of the Figure of the Earth,\r\nand I wrote out very carefully my Trigonometry for the Encyclopaedia\r\nMetropolitana. I read a little of Machiavelli, and various books\r\nwhich I borrowed of Mr Southey. On Friday, Sept. 30th, my brother and\r\nI left for Kendal, and after a stay of a few days at Edensor, arrived\r\nat Cambridge on Oct. 11th.\r\n\r\n\"On Oct. 21st my Lectures to the Junior Sophs began, 39 names, lasting\r\nto Dec. 13th. Those to the Senior Sophs, 16 names, Oct 29th to\r\nDec. 10th. I also examined Questionists as last year. I have notes\r\nabout a Paper on the connection of impact and pressure, read at the\r\nPhilosophical Society on Nov. 14th, but not printed, dipping-needle\r\nproblems, curve described round three centres of force, barometer\r\nobservations, theory of the Figure of the Earth with variable density,\r\nand effect on the Moon, correction to the Madras pendulum, wedge with\r\nfriction, spots seen in my eyes, density of rays near a caustic. In\r\nthis term I accomplished the preparation of a volume of Mathematical\r\nTracts on subjects which, either from their absolute deficiency in the\r\nUniversity or from the unreadable form in which they had been\r\npresented, appeared to be wanted. The subjects of my Tracts were,\r\nLunar Theory (begun Oct. 26th, finished Nov. 1st), Figure of the Earth\r\n(1st part finished Nov. 18th), Precession and Nutation (my old MS. put\r\nin order), and the Calculus of Variations. I applied, as is frequently\r\ndone, to the Syndicate of the University Press for assistance in\r\npublishing the work; and they agreed to give me paper and printing for\r\n500 copies. This notice was received from Professor Turton on\r\nNov. 29th, 1825. It was probably also in this year that I drew up an\r\nimperfect 'Review' of Coddington's Optics, a work which deserved\r\nsevere censure: my review was never finished.\r\n\r\n\"In the Long Vacation at Keswick I had six pupils at _£42_ each. In\r\nthe October term I had Marshman and Ogilby at _£105_ for three terms,\r\nand Dobbs at _£75_ for three terms. I had, at Mr Peacock's suggestion,\r\nraised my rate from 60 to 100 guineas for three terms: this prevented\r\nsome from applying to me, and induced some to withdraw who had been\r\nconnected with me: but it did me no real hurt, for engrossment by\r\npupils is the worst of all things that can happen to a man who hopes\r\nto distinguish himself. On Dec. 17th I went to Bury, and returned to\r\nCambridge on Jan. 30th, 1826.\r\n\r\n\"I have the attendance-bills of my Lectures to Senior Sophs (16) from\r\nFeb. 3rd to Feb. 23rd, and to Freshmen (40) from Feb. 27th to\r\nMar. 15. It would appear that I gave but one college-lecture per day\r\n(my belief was that I always had two). The tutor's stipend per term\r\nwas _£50_. On my quires I find, Investigations for the ellipticity of\r\na heterogeneous spheroid when the density is expressed by sin\r\n_qc_/_qc_ (the remarkable properties of which I believe I discovered\r\nentirely myself, although they had been discovered by other persons),\r\nTheoretical Numbers for precession, nutation, &c., some investigations\r\nusing Laplace's Y, hard work on the Figure of the Earth to the 2nd\r\norder,'Woodhouse's remaining apparatus,' Notes about Lambton's and\r\nKater's errors, Depolarization, Notes of Papers on depolarization in\r\nthe Phil. Trans., Magnetic Investigations for Lieut. Foster,\r\nIsochronous Oscillations in a resisting medium, Observations on a\r\nstrange piece of Iceland Spar. On Mar. 7th forwarded Preface and Title\r\nPage for my Mathematical Tracts.\r\n\r\n\"Some time in this term I began to think of the possibility of\r\nobserving the diminution of gravity in a deep mine, and communicated\r\nwith Whewell, who was disposed to join in experiments. My first notion\r\nwas simply to try the rate of a clock, and the Ecton mine was first\r\nthought of. I made enquiries about the Ecton mine through Mr Smith (of\r\nEdensor), and visited the mine, but in the meantime Whewell had made\r\nenquiries in London and found (principally from Dr Paris) that the\r\nmine of Dolcoath near Camborne in Cornwall would be a better place for\r\nthe experiment. Dr Paris wrote to me repeatedly, and ultimately we\r\nresolved on trying it there. In my papers on Mar. 21st are various\r\ninvestigations about attractions in both mines. On Apr. 3rd I went to\r\nLondon, principally to arrange about Dolcoath, and during April and\r\nMay I was engaged in correspondence with Sir H. Davy (President of\r\nthe Royal Society), Mr Herschel, and Dr Young (Secretary of the Board\r\nof Longitude) about the loan of instruments and pendulums. On\r\nApr. 23rd I was practising pendulum-observations (by coincidence); and\r\nabout this time repeatedly practised transits with a small instrument\r\nlent by Mr Sheepshanks (with whom my acquaintance must have begun no\r\nlong time before) which was erected under a tent in the Fellows'\r\nWalks. On my quires I find various schemes for graduating thermometers\r\nfor pendulum experiments.\r\n\r\n\"I find also Notes of examination of my brother William, who had come\r\nto College last October; and a great deal of correspondence with my\r\nmother and sister and Mr Case, a lawyer, about a troublesome business\r\nwith Mr Cropley, an old friend of G. Biddell, to whom my father had\r\nlent _£500_ and whose affairs were in Chancery.\r\n\r\n\"My lectures in this term were to the Junior Sophs from Apr. 10th to\r\nMay 13th: they were six in number and not very regular. On Apr. 28th I\r\nsent to Mawman the copy of my Trigonometry for the Encyclopaedia\r\nMetropolitana, for which I received _£42_. I received notice from the\r\nPress Syndicate that the price of my Mathematical Tracts was fixed at\r\n_6s. 6d._: I sold the edition to Deighton for _£70_, and it was\r\nimmediately published. About this time I have letters from Mr Herschel\r\nand Sir H. Davy about a Paper to be presented to the Royal Society--I\r\nsuppose about the Figure of the Earth to the 2nd order of ellipticity,\r\nwhich was read to the Royal Society on June 15th.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday, May 13th, 1826, I went to London on the way to Dolcoath,\r\nand received four chronometers from the Royal Observatory,\r\nGreenwich. I travelled by Devonport and Falmouth to Camborne, where I\r\narrived on May 20th and dined at the count-house dinner at the mine. I\r\nwas accompanied by Ibbotson, who was engaged as a pupil, and intended\r\nfor an engineer. On May 24th Whewell arrived, and we took a pendulum\r\nand clock down, and on the 30th commenced the observation of\r\ncoincidences in earnest. This work, with the changing of the\r\npendulums, and sundry short expeditions, occupied nearly three\r\nweeks. We had continued the computation of our observations at every\r\npossible interval. It is to be understood that we had one detached\r\npendulum swinging in front of a clock pendulum above, and another\r\nsimilarly mounted below; and that the clocks were compared by\r\nchronometers compared above, carried down and compared, compared\r\nbefore leaving, and brought up and compared. The upper and lower\r\npendulums had been interchanged. It was found now that the reliance\r\non the steadiness of the chronometers was too great; and a new method\r\nwas devised, in which for each series the chronometers should make\r\nfour journeys and have four comparisons above and two below. This\r\narrangement commenced on the 19th June and continued till the 20th. On\r\nthe 26th we packed the lower instruments, intending to compare the\r\npendulum directly with the upper one, and sent them up the shaft: when\r\nan inexplicable occurrence stopped all proceedings. The basket\r\ncontaining all the important instruments was brought up to the surface\r\n(in my presence) on fire; some of the instruments had fallen out with\r\ntheir cases burning. Whether a superstitious miner had intentionally\r\nfired it, or whether the snuff of a candle had been thrown into it, is\r\nnot known. Our labour was now rendered useless. On the 28th I packed\r\nup what remained of instruments, left for Truro, and arrived at Bury\r\non July 1st. During our stay in Cornwall I had attended a 'ticketing'\r\nor sale of ore at Camborne, and we had made expeditions to the\r\nN.W. Coast, to Portreath and Illogan, to Marazion and St Michael's\r\nMount, and to Penzance and the Land's End. On July 3rd I saw Mr\r\nCropley in Bury gaol, and went to Cambridge. On the 4th I was admitted\r\nA.M., and on the 5th was admitted Major Fellow.\r\n\r\n\"I had engaged with four pupils to go to Orléans in this Long\r\nVacation: my brother William was also to go. One of my pupils, Dobbs,\r\ndid not join: the other three were Tinkler, Ogilby, and Ibbotson. We\r\nleft London on July 9th, and travelled by Brighton, Dieppe, Rouen, and\r\nParis to Orléans. At Paris I saw Bouvard, Pouillet, Laplace and\r\nArago. I had introductions from Mr Peacock, Mr South, Mr Herschel, Dr\r\nYoung; and from Professor Sedgwick to an English resident, Mr\r\nUnderwood. On the 19th I was established in the house of M. Lagarde,\r\nProtestant Minister. Here I received my pupils. On the 28th I\r\ncommenced Italian with an Italian master: perhaps I might have done\r\nmore prudently in adhering to French, for I made no great progress. On\r\nAug. 2nd I saw a murderer guillotined in the Place Martroi. The\r\nprincipal investigations on my quires are--Investigations about\r\npendulums, Calculus of Variations, Notes for the Figure of the Earth\r\n(Encyc. Metrop.) and commencement of the article, steam-engine\r\nmachinery, &c. I picked up various French ballads, read various books,\r\ngot copies of the Marseillaise (this I was obliged to obtain rather\r\nsecretly, as the legitimist power under Charles X. was then at its\r\nheight) and other music, and particulars of farm wages for Whewell and\r\nR. Jones. The summer was intensely hot, and I believe that the heat\r\nand the work in Dolcoath had weakened me a good deal. The family was\r\nthe old clergyman, his wife, his daughter, and finally his son. We\r\nlived together very amicably. My brother lodged in a Café in the Place\r\nMartroi; the others in different families. I left Orléans on\r\nSept. 30th for Paris. Here I attended the Institut, and was present at\r\none of Ampère's Lectures. I arrived at Cambridge on Oct. 14th.\r\n\r\n\"On Oct. 16th Whewell mentioned to me that the Lucasian Professorship\r\nwould be immediately vacated by Turton, and encouraged me to compete\r\nfor it. Shortly afterwards Mr Higman mentioned the Professorship, and\r\nJoshua King (of Queens') spoke on the restriction which prevented\r\nCollege tutors or Assistant tutors from holding the office. About\r\nthis time Mr Peacock rendered me a very important service. As the\r\nemolument of the Lucasian Professorship was only _£99_, and that of\r\nthe Assistant Tutorship _£150_, I had determined to withdraw from the\r\ncandidature. But Mr Peacock represented to me the advantage of\r\nposition which would be gained by obtaining the Professorship (which I\r\nthen instantly saw), and I continued to be a candidate. I wrote\r\nletters to the Heads of Colleges (the electors) and canvassed them\r\npersonally. Only Dr Davy, the Master of Caius College, at once\r\npromised me his vote. Dr French, Master of Jesus College, was a\r\ncandidate; and several of the Heads had promised him their votes. Mr\r\nBabbage, the third candidate, threatened legal proceedings, and Dr\r\nFrench withdrew. The course was now open for Mr Babbage and me.\r\n\r\n\"In the meetings of the Philosophical Society a new mode of proceeding\r\nwas introduced this term. To enliven the meetings, private members\r\nwere requested to give oral lectures. Mine was the second, I think,\r\nand I took for subject The Machinery of the Steam Engines in the\r\nCornish mines, and especially of the Pumping Engines and Pumps. It\r\nmade an excellent lecture: the subjects were at that time undescribed\r\nin books, and unknown to engineers in general out of Cornwall.\r\n\r\n\"My College lectures seem to have been, Oct. 21st to Dec. 14th to 31\r\nJunior Sophs, Dec. 4th to 12th to 12 Senior Sophs. I assisted at the\r\nexaminations of the Questionists. I had no private pupils. On\r\nNov. 26th I communicated to the Cambridge Philosophical Society a\r\nPaper on the Theory of Pendulums, Balances, and Escapements: and I\r\nfind applications of Babbage's symbolism to an escapement which I\r\nproposed. I have various investigations about the Earth, supposed to\r\nproject at middle latitudes above the elliptical form. In November an\r\naccount of the Dolcoath failure (by Whewell) was given to the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\"At length on Dec. 7th, 1826, the election to the Lucasian\r\nProfessorship took place: I was elected (I think unanimously) and\r\nadmitted. I believe that this gave great satisfaction to the\r\nUniversity in general. My uncle, Arthur Biddell, was in Cambridge on\r\nthat evening, and was the first of my friends who heard of it. On the\r\nsame page of my quires on which this is mentioned, there is a great\r\nlist of apparatus to be constructed for Lucasian Lectures, notes of\r\nexperiments with Atwood's Machine, &c. In December, correspondence\r\nwith Dollond about prisms. I immediately issued a printed notice that\r\nI would give professorial lectures in the next Term.\r\n\r\n\"On Dec. 13th I have a letter from Mr Smith informing me of the\r\ndangerous illness (fever) which had attacked nearly every member of\r\nhis family, Richarda worst of all. On Dec. 23rd I went to Bury. The\r\naffairs with Cropley had been settled by the sale of his property\r\nunder execution, and my father did not lose much of his debt. But he\r\nhad declined much in body and mind, and now had strange\r\nhallucinations.\r\n\r\n\"The commencement of 1827 found me in a better position (not in money\r\nbut in prospects) than I had before stood in: yet it was far from\r\nsatisfactory. I had resigned my Assistant Tutorship of _£150_ per\r\nannum together with the prospect of succeeding to a Tutorship, and\r\ngained only the Lucasian Professorship of _£99_ per annum. I had a\r\ngreat aversion to entering the Church: and my lay fellowship would\r\nexpire in 7 years. My prospects in the law or other professions might\r\nhave been good if I could have waited: but then I must have been in a\r\nstate of starvation probably for many years, and marriage would have\r\nbeen out of the question: I much preferred a moderate income in no\r\nlong time, and I am sure that in this I judged rightly for my\r\nhappiness. I had now in some measure taken science as my line (though\r\nnot irrevocably), and I thought it best to work it well, for a time at\r\nleast, and wait for accidents.\r\n\r\n\"The acceptance of the Lucasian Professorship prevented me from being\r\npressed by Sedgwick (who was Proctor this year) to take the office of\r\nmoderator: which was a great relief to me. As Lucasian Professor I was\r\nipso facto Member of the Board of Longitude. A stipend of _£100_ a\r\nyear was attached to this, on condition of attending four meetings:\r\nbut I had good reason (from intimations by South and other persons in\r\nLondon) for believing that this would not last long. The fortnightly\r\nnotices of the meetings of the Board were given on Jan. 18th,\r\nMar. 22nd, May 24th and Oct. 18th.\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 2nd, 1827, I came from London to Bury. I found my father in a\r\nvery declining state (the painful rheumatism of some years had changed\r\nto ulcerations of the legs, and he was otherwise helpless and had\r\ndistressing hallucinations). On Jan. 8th I walked to Cambridge. At\r\nboth places I was occupied in preparations for the Smith's Prize\r\nExamination and for lectures (for the latter I obtained at Bury gaol\r\nsome numerical results about tread-mills).\r\n\r\n\"Of the Smith's Prize I was officially an Examiner: and I determined\r\nto begin with---what had never been done before--making the\r\nexamination public, by printing the papers of questions. The Prize is\r\nthe highest Mathematical honour in the University: the competitors are\r\nincepting Bachelors of Arts after the examination for that Degree. My\r\nday of examination (apparently) was Jan. 21st. The candidates were\r\nTurner, Cankrein, Cleasby, and Mr Gordon. The first three had been my\r\nprivate pupils: Mr Gordon was a Fellow-commoner of St Peter's College,\r\nand had just passed the B.A. examination as Senior Wrangler, Turner\r\nbeing second. My situation as Examiner was rather a delicate one, and\r\nthe more so as, when I came to examine the papers of answers, Turner\r\nappeared distinctly the first. Late at night I carried the papers to\r\nWhewell's rooms, and he on inspection agreed with me. The other\r\nexaminers (Professors Lax and Woodhouse, Lowndean and Plumian\r\nProfessors) generally supported me: and Turner had the honour of First\r\nSmith's Prize.\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 30th my mother wrote, asking if I could see Cropley in\r\nLondon, where he was imprisoned for contempt of Chancery. I attended\r\nthe meeting of the Board of Longitude on Feb. 1st, and afterwards\r\nvisited Cropley in the Fleet Prison. He died there, some time\r\nlater. It was by the sale of his effects under execution that my\r\nfather's debt was paid.\r\n\r\n\"On Feb. 15th I communicated to the Royal Society a Paper on the\r\ncorrection of the Solar Tables from South's observations. I believe\r\nthat I had alluded to this at the February meeting of the Board of\r\nLongitude, and that in consequence Mr Pond, the Astronomer Royal, had\r\nbeen requested to prepare the errors of the Sun's place from the\r\nGreenwich observations: which were supplied some months later. With\r\nthe exception of South's Solar Errors, and some investigations about\r\ndipping-needles, I do not find anything going on but matters connected\r\nwith my approaching lectures. There are bridges, trusses, and other\r\nmechanical matters, theoretical and practical, without end. Several\r\ntradesmen in Cambridge and London were well employed. On Feb. 13th I\r\nhave a letter from Cubitt about groins: I remember studying those of\r\nthe Custom-house and other places. On Feb. 20th my Syllabus of\r\nLectures was finished: this in subsequent years was greatly\r\nimproved. I applied to the Royal Society for the loan of Huyghens's\r\nobject-glass, but they declined to lend it. About this time I find\r\nobservations of the spectrum of Sirius.\r\n\r\n\"There had been no lectures on Experimental Philosophy (Mechanics,\r\nHydrostatics, Optics) for many years. The University in general, I\r\nbelieve, looked with great satisfaction to my vigorous beginning:\r\nstill there was considerable difficulty about it. There was no\r\nunderstood term for the Lectures: no understood hour of the day: no\r\nunderstood lecture room. I began this year in the Lent Term, but in\r\nall subsequent years I took the Easter Term, mainly for the chance of\r\nsunlight for the optical experiments, which I soon made important. I\r\ncould get no room but a private or retiring room (not a regular\r\nlecture room) in the buildings at the old Botanic Garden: in following\r\nyears I had the room under the University Library. The Lectures\r\ncommenced on some day in February 1827: I think that the number who\r\nattended them was about 64. I remember very well that the matter which\r\nI had prepared as an Introductory Lecture did not last above half the\r\ntime that I had expected, but I managed very well to fill up the\r\nhour. On another occasion I was so ill-prepared that I had\r\ncontemplated giving notice that I was unable to complete the hour's\r\nlecture, but I saw in the front row some strangers, introduced by some\r\nof my regular attendants, very busy in taking notes, and as it was\r\nevident that a break-down now would not do, I silently exerted myself\r\nto think of something, and made a very good lecture.\r\n\r\n\"On Mar. 1st, as official examiner, I received notices from 14\r\ncandidates for Bell's Scholarships, and prepared my Paper of\r\nquestions. I do not remember my day of examination; but I had all the\r\nanswers to all the examiners' questions in my hands, when on Mar. 27th\r\nI received notice that my father had died the preceding evening. This\r\nstopped my Lectures: they were concluded in the next term. I think\r\nthat I had only Mechanics and imperfect Optics this term, no\r\nHydrostatics; and that the resumed Lectures were principally\r\nOptical. They terminated about May 14th.\r\n\r\n\"With my brother I at once went to Bury to attend my father's\r\nfuneral. He was buried on Mar. 31st, 1827, in the churchyard of Little\r\nWhelnetham, on the north side of the church. Shortly afterwards I went\r\nto London, and on Apr. 5th I attended a meeting of the Board of\r\nLongitude, at which Herschel produced a Paper regarding improvements\r\nof the Nautical Almanac. Herschel and I were in fact the leaders of\r\nthe reforming party in the Board of Longitude: Dr Young the Secretary\r\nresisted change as much as possible. After the meeting I went to\r\nCambridge. I find then calculations of achromatic eye-pieces for a\r\nvery nice model with silk threads of various colours which I made with\r\nmy own hands for my optical lectures.\r\n\r\n\"On Apr. 7th Herschel wrote to me that the Professorship held by Dr\r\nBrinkley (then appointed Bishop of Cloyne) at Dublin would be vacant,\r\nand recommended it to my notice, and sent me some introductions. I\r\nreached Dublin on Apr. 15th, where I was received with great kindness\r\nby Dr Brinkley and Dr MacDonnell (afterwards Provost). I there met the\r\nthen Provost Dr Bartholomew Lloyd, Dr Lardner, Mr Hamilton (afterwards\r\nSir W. R. Hamilton) and others. In a few days I found that they\r\ngreatly desired to appoint Hamilton if possible (they did in fact\r\novercome some difficulties and appoint him in a few months), and that\r\nthey would not make such an augmentation as would induce me to offer\r\nmyself as a candidate, and I withdrew. I have always remembered with\r\ngratitude Dr MacDonnell's conduct, in carefully putting me on a fair\r\nfooting in this matter. I returned by Holyhead, and arrived at\r\nBirmingham on Apr. 23rd. While waiting there and looking over some\r\npapers relating to the spherical aberration of eye-pieces, in which I\r\nhad been stopped some time by a geometrical difficulty, I did in the\r\ncoffee-room of a hotel overcome the difficulty; and this was the\r\nfoundation of a capital paper on the Spherical Aberration of\r\nEye-pieces. This paper was afterwards presented to the Cambridge\r\nPhilosophical Society.\r\n\r\n\"About this time a circumstance occurred of a disagreeable nature,\r\nwhich however did not much disconcert me. Mr Ivory, who had a good\r\nmany years before made himself favourably known as a mathematician,\r\nespecially by his acquaintance with Laplace's peculiar analysis, had\r\nadopted (as not unfrequently happens) some singular hydrostatical\r\ntheories. In my last Paper on the Figure of the Earth, I had said that\r\nI could not receive one of his equations. In the Philosophical\r\nMagazine of May he attacked me for this with great heat. On May 8th I\r\nwrote an answer, and I think it soon became known that I was not to be\r\nattacked with impunity.\r\n\r\n\"Long before this time there had been some proposal about an excursion\r\nto the Lake District with my sister, and I now arranged to carry it\r\nout. On May 23rd I went to Bury and on to Playford: while there I\r\nsketched the Cumberland excursion. On June 5th I went to London, I\r\nbelieve to the Visitation of the Greenwich Observatory to which I was\r\ninvited. I also attended the meeting of the Board of Longitude. I\r\nthink it was here that Pond's Errors of the Sun's place in the\r\nNautical Almanac from Greenwich Observations were produced. On June\r\n7th I went by coach to Rugby, where I met my sister, and we travelled\r\nto Edensor. We made a number of excursions in Derbyshire, and then\r\npassed on by Penrith to Keswick, where we arrived on June 22nd. From\r\nKeswick we made many excursions in the Lake District, visited Mr\r\nSouthey and Mr Wordsworth, descended a coal mine at Whitehaven, and\r\nreturned to Edensor by the way of Ambleside, Kendal, and Manchester.\r\nWith sundry excursions in Derbyshire our trip ended, and we returned\r\nto Cambridge on the 21st July.\r\n\r\n\"During this Long Vacation I had one private pupil, Crawford, the only\r\npupil this year, and the last that I ever had. At this time there is\r\non my papers an infinity of optical investigations: also a plan of an\r\neye-piece with a concave lens to destroy certain aberrations. On\r\nAug. 20th I went to Woodford to see Messrs Gilbert's optical\r\nworks. From Aug. 13th I had been preparing for the discussion of the\r\nGreenwich Solar Errors, and I had a man at work in my rooms, engaged\r\non the calculation of the Errors. I wrote to Bouvard at Paris for\r\nobservations of the sun, but he recommended me to wait for the Tables\r\nwhich Bessel was preparing. I was busy too about my Lectures: on\r\nSept. 29th I have a set of plans of printing presses from Hansard the\r\nprinter (who in a visit to Cambridge had found me making enquiries\r\nabout them), and I corresponded with Messrs Gilbert about optical\r\nconstructions, and with W. and S. Jones, Eastons, and others about\r\npumps, hydraulic rams, &c. On Sept. 25th occurred a very magnificent\r\nAurora Borealis.\r\n\r\n\"I do not find when the investigation of Corrections of Solar Elements\r\nwas finished, or when my Extracts from Burckhardt, Connaissance des\r\nTemps 1816, were made. But these led me to suspect an unknown\r\ninequality in the Sun's motion. On Sept. 27th and 28th I find the\r\nfirst suspicions of an inequality depending on 8 × mean longitude of\r\nVenus--13 × mean longitude of Earth. The thing appeared so promising\r\nthat I commenced the investigation of the perturbation related to this\r\nterm, and continued it (a very laborious work) as fast as I was able,\r\nthough with various interruptions, which in fact were necessary to\r\nkeep up my spirits. On Oct. 30th I went to London for the Board of\r\nLongitude meeting. Here I exhibited the results of my Sun\r\ninvestigations, and urged the correction of the elements used in the\r\nNautical Almanac. Dr Young objected, and proposed that Bouvard should\r\nbe consulted. Professor Woodhouse, the Plumian Professor, was present,\r\nand behaved so captiously that some members met afterwards to consider\r\nhow order could be maintained. I believe it was during this visit to\r\nLondon that I took measures of Hammersmith Suspension Bridge for an\r\nintended Lecture-model. Frequently, but not always, when in London, I\r\nresided at the house of Mr Sheepshanks and his sister Miss\r\nSheepshanks, 30 Woburn Place. My quires, at this time, abound with\r\nsuggestions for lectures and examinations.\r\n\r\n\"On some day about the end of November or beginning of December 1827,\r\nwhen I was walking with Mr Peacock near the outside gate of the\r\nTrinity Walks, on some mention of Woodhouse, the Plumian Professor, Mr\r\nPeacock said that he was never likely to rise into activity again (or\r\nusing some expression importing mortal illness). Instantly there had\r\npassed through my mind the certainty of my succeeding him, the good\r\nposition in which I stood towards the University, the probability of\r\nthat position being improved by improved lectures, &c., &c., and by\r\nincreased reputation from the matters in which I was now engaged, the\r\npower of thus commanding an increase of income. I should then have,\r\nindependent of my Fellowship, some competent income, and a house over\r\nmy head. I was quite aware that some time might elapse, but now for\r\nthe first time I saw my way clearly. The care of the Observatory had\r\nbeen for two or three years attached to the Plumian Professorship. A\r\nGrace was immediately prepared, entrusting the temporary care of the\r\nObservatory to Dr French, to me, Mr Catton, Mr Sheepshanks, and Mr\r\nKing (afterwards Master of Queens' College). On Dec. 6th I have a note\r\nfrom Mr King about going to the Observatory.\r\n\r\n\"On Dec. 6th my Paper on corrections of the elements of the Solar\r\nTables was presented to the Royal Society. On Dec. 9th, at 1 h. 4\r\nm. a.m. (Sunday morning), I arrived at the result of my calculations\r\nof the new inequality. I had gone through some fluctuations of\r\nfeeling. Usually the important part of an inequality of this kind\r\ndepends entirely on the eccentricities of the orbits, but it so\r\nhappened that from the positions of the axes of the orbits, &c., these\r\nterms very nearly destroyed each other. After this came the\r\nconsideration of inclinations of orbits; and here were sensible terms\r\nwhich were not destroyed. Finally I arrived at the result that the\r\ninequality would be about 3\"; just such a magnitude as was required. I\r\nslipped this into Whewell's door. This is, to the time of writing\r\n(1853), the last improvement of any importance in the Solar\r\nTheory. Some little remaining work went on to Dec. 14th, and then,\r\nbeing thoroughly tired, I laid by the work for revision at some future\r\ntime. I however added a Postscript to my Royal Society Paper on Solar\r\nErrors, notifying this result.\r\n\r\n\"On Dec. 19th I went to Bury. While there I heard from Whewell that\r\nWoodhouse was dead. I returned to Cambridge and immediately made known\r\nthat I was a candidate for the now vacant Plumian Professorship. Of\r\nmiscellaneous scientific business, I find that on Oct. 13th Professor\r\nBarlow of Woolwich prepared a memorial to the Board of Longitude\r\nconcerning his fluid telescope (which I had seen at Woodford), which\r\nwas considered on Nov. 1st, and I had some correspondence with him in\r\nDecember. In June and August my Trigonometry was printing.\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 5th, 1828, I came from London. It seems that I had been\r\nspeculating truly 'without book' on perturbations of planetary\r\nelements, for on Jan. 17th and 18th I wrote a Paper on a supposed\r\nerror of Laplace, and just at the end I discovered that he was quite\r\nright: I folded up the Paper and marked it 'A Lesson.' I set two\r\npapers of questions for Smith's Prizes (there being a deficiency of\r\none Examiner, viz. the Plumian Professor).\r\n\r\n\"Before the beginning of 1828 Whewell and I had determined on\r\nrepeating the Dolcoath experiments. On Jan. 8th I have a letter from\r\nDavies Gilbert (then President of the Royal Society) congratulating me\r\nupon the Solar Theory, and alluding to our intended summer's visit to\r\nCornwall. We had somehow applied to the Board of Longitude for\r\npendulums, but Dr Young wished to delay them, having with Capt. Basil\r\nHall concocted a scheme for making Lieut. Foster do all the work:\r\nWhewell and I were indignant at this, and no more was said about\r\nit. On Jan. 24th Dr Young, in giving notice of the Board of Longitude\r\nmeeting, informs me that the clocks and pendulums are ready.\r\n\r\n\"I had made known that I was a candidate for the Plumian\r\nProfessorship, and nobody thought it worth while to oppose me. One\r\nperson at least (Earnshaw) had intended to compete, but he called on\r\nme to make certain that I was a candidate, and immediately withdrew. I\r\nwent on in quality of Syndic for the care of the Observatory,\r\ningrafting myself into it. But meantime I told everybody that the\r\nsalary (about _£300_) was not sufficient for me; and on Jan. 20th I\r\ndrafted a manifesto or application to the University for an increase\r\nof salary. The day of election to the Professorship was Feb. 6th. As I\r\nwas officially (as Lucasian Professor) an elector, I was present, and\r\nI explained to the electors that I could not undertake the\r\nresponsibility of the Observatory without augmentation of income, and\r\nthat I requested their express sanction to my application to the\r\nUniversity for that purpose. They agreed to this generally, and I was\r\nelected. I went to London immediately to attend a meeting of the\r\nBoard of Longitude and returned on Feb. 8th. On Feb. 15th I began my\r\nLectures (which, this year, included Mechanics, Optics, Pneumatics,\r\nand Hydrostatics) in the room below the University Library. The number\r\nof names was 26. The Lectures terminated on Mar. 22nd.\r\n\r\n\"On Feb. 25th I received from Mr Pond information on the emoluments at\r\nGreenwich Observatory. I drew up a second manifesto, and on Feb. 26th\r\nI wrote and signed a formal copy for the Plumian electors. On\r\nFeb. 27th I met them at Caius Lodge (the Master, Dr Davy, being\r\nVice-Chancellor). I read my Paper, which was approved, and their\r\nsanction was given in the form of a request to the Vice-Chancellor to\r\npermit the paper to be printed and circulated. My paper, with this\r\nrequest at the head, was immediately printed, and a copy was sent to\r\nevery resident M.A. (more than 200 went out in one day). The statement\r\nand composition of the paper were generally approved, but the\r\nUniversity had never before been taken by storm in such a manner, and\r\nthere was some commotion about it. I believe that very few persons\r\nwould have taken the same step. Mr Sheepshanks wrote to me on\r\nMar. 7th, intimating that it was desperate. I had no doubt of\r\nsuccess. Whewell told me that some people accused me of bad faith, in\r\nomitting allusion to the _£100_ a year received as Member of the Board\r\nof Longitude, and to the profits of Lectures. I wrote him a note,\r\ntelling him that I had most certain information of the intention to\r\ndissolve the Board of Longitude (which was done in less than six\r\nmonths), and that by two years' Lectures I had gained _£45_ (the\r\nexpenses being _£200_, receipts _£245_). This letter was sent to the\r\ncomplaining people, and no more was said. By the activity of\r\nSheepshanks and the kindness of Dr Davy the business gradually grew\r\ninto shape, and on Mar. 21st a Grace passed the Senate for appointing\r\na Syndicate to consider of augmentation. Sheepshanks was one of the\r\nSyndicate, and was understood to represent, in some measure, my\r\ninterests. The progress of the Syndicate however was by no means a\r\nstraightforward one. Members of the Senate soon began to remark that\r\nbefore giving anything they ought to know the amount of the University\r\nrevenue, and another Syndicate was then appointed to enquire and\r\nreport upon it. It was more than a year before my Syndicate could\r\nmake their recommendation: however, in fact, I lost nothing by that\r\ndelay, as I was rising in the estimation of the University. The\r\nObservatory house was furnished, partly from Woodhouse's sale, and\r\npartly from new furniture. My mother and sister came to live with me\r\nthere. On Mar. 15th 1828 I began the Observatory Journal; on Mar. 27th\r\nI slept at the Observatory for the first time, and on Apr. 15th I came\r\nto reside there permanently, and gave up my college rooms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n              AT CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY. FROM HIS TAKING\r\n              CHARGE OF THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY TO HIS\r\n           RESIDENCE AT GREENWICH OBSERVATORY AS ASTRONOMER\r\n                                ROYAL.\r\n\r\n                FROM MARCH 15TH 1828 TO JAN. 1ST 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1828\r\n\r\n\"I attended a meeting of the Board of Longitude on Apr. 3rd. And\r\nagain on June 4th; this was the last meeting: Sheepshanks had\r\npreviously given me private information of the certainty of its\r\ndissolution.--On Apr. 4th I visited Mr Herschel at Slough, where one\r\nevening I saw Saturn with his 20-foot telescope, the best view of it\r\nthat I have ever had.--In June I attended the Greenwich Observatory\r\nVisitation.--Before my election (as Plumian Professor) there are\r\nvarious schemes on my quires for computation of transit corrections,\r\n&c. After Apr. 15th there are corrections for deficient wires,\r\ninequality of pivots, &c. And I began a book of proposed regulations\r\nfor observations. In this are plans for groups of stars for R.A. (the\r\nTransit Instrument being the only one finished): order of preference\r\nof classes of observations: no reductions to be made after dinner, or\r\non Sunday: no loose papers: observations to be stopped if reductions\r\nare two months in arrear: stars selected for parallax.--The reduction\r\nof transits begins on Apr. 15th. On May 15th Mr Pond sent me some\r\nmoon-transits to aid in determining my longitude.--Dr Young, in a\r\nletter to me of May 7th, enquires whether I will accept a free\r\nadmission to the Royal Society, which I declined. On May 9th I was\r\nelected to the Astronomical Society.--Towards the end of the year I\r\nobserved Encke's Comet: and determined the latitude of the Observatory\r\nwith Sheepshanks's repeating circle.--On my papers I find a sketch of\r\nan Article on the Figure of the Earth for the Encyclopaedia\r\nMetropolitana.\r\n\r\n\"As early as Feb. 23rd I had been in correspondence with T. Jones, the\r\ninstrument-maker, about pendulums for a repetition of the Dolcoath\r\nExperiments. Invitations had been received, and everything was\r\narranged with Whewell. Sheepshanks, my brother, and Mr Jackson of\r\nIpswich (Caius Coll.) were to go, and we were subsequently joined by\r\nSedgwick, and Lodge (Magdalene Coll.). On July 3rd Sheepshanks and I\r\nstarted by Salisbury, taking Sherborne on our way to look at the\r\nchurch, which had alarmed the people by signs of a crack, and arrived\r\nat Camborne on July 8th. On the 14th we set up the pendulums, and at\r\nonce commenced observations, our plan being, to have no intermission\r\nin the pendulum observations, so that as soon as the arc became too\r\nsmall a fresh series was started. On July 29th we raised the\r\ninstruments, and Sheepshanks, who managed much of the upper\r\noperations, both astronomical and of pendulums, mounted the pendulums\r\ntogether in his observatory. We went on with our calculations, and on\r\nAugust 8th, on returning from a visit to John Williams at Barncoose,\r\nwe heard that there was a 'run' in Dolcoath, that is a sinking of the\r\nwhole mass of rock where it had been set free by the mine excavations:\r\nprobably only a few inches, but enough to break the rock much and to\r\nstop the pumps. On Aug. 10th the calculations of our observations\r\nshewed that there was something wrong, and on the 13th I perceived an\r\nanomaly in the form of the knife edge of one pendulum, and of its\r\nagate planes, and suggested cautions for repeating the observations.\r\nWe determined at once to repeat them: and as the water was rising in\r\nthe mine there was no time to be lost. We again sent the instruments\r\ndown, and made observations on the 16th, 17th and 18th. On the 19th I\r\nsent the instruments up, for the water was near our station, and\r\nSedgwick, Whewell, and I went on a geological expedition to the\r\nLizard. On our return we met Sheepshanks and the others, and found the\r\nresults of the last observations unsatisfactory. The results of\r\ncomparing the pendulums were discordant, and the knife edge of the\r\nfaulty pendulum had very sensibly altered. We now gave up\r\nobservations, with the feeling that our time had been totally lost,\r\nmainly through the fault of the maker of the pendulum (T. Jones). On\r\nthe 28th we made an expedition to Penzance and other places, and\r\narrived at Cambridge on the 17th of September.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of the work at Dolcoath we made various expeditions as\r\nopportunity offered. Thus we walked to Carn Brea and witnessed the\r\nwrestling, the common game of the country. On another occasion\r\nSedgwick, Whewell, and I had a capital geological expedition to\r\nTrewavas Head to examine granite veins. We visited at Pendarves and\r\nTrevince, and made the expedition to the Lizard already referred to,\r\nand saw many of the sights in the neighbourhood. After visiting\r\nPenzance on the conclusion of our work we saw Cape Cornwall (where\r\nWhewell overturned me in a gig), and returned homewards by way of\r\nTruro, Plymouth (where we saw the watering-place and breakwater: also\r\nthe Dockyard, and descended in one of the working diving-bells),\r\nExeter, Salisbury, and Portsmouth. In returning from Camborne in 1826\r\nI lost the principal of our papers. It was an odd thing that, in going\r\nthrough Exeter on our way to Camborne in 1828, I found them complete\r\nat Exeter, identified to the custodian by the dropping out of a letter\r\nwith my address.\r\n\r\n\"On my return to Cambridge I was immediately immersed in the work of\r\nthe Observatory. The only instrument then mounted at the Observatory\r\nwas the Transit. I had no Assistant whatever.--A Mr Galbraith of\r\nEdinburgh had questioned something in one of my Papers about the\r\nFigure of the Earth. I drew up a rather formal answer to it: Whewell\r\nsaw my draft and drew up a much more pithy one, which I adopted and\r\nsent to the Philosophical Magazine.--For comparing our clocks at the\r\nupper and lower stations of Dolcoath we had borrowed from the Royal\r\nObservatory, Greenwich, six good pocket chronometers: they were still\r\nin the care of Mr Sheepshanks. I arranged with him that they should be\r\nsent backwards and forwards a few times for determining the longitude\r\nof Cambridge Observatory. This was done on Oct. 21st, 22nd, 23rd: the\r\nresult was 23°54, and this has been used to the present time\r\n(1853). It evinced an error in the Trigonometrical Survey, the origin\r\nof which was found, I think, afterwards (Dr Pearson in a letter of\r\nDec. 17th spoke of the mistake of a may-pole for a signal-staff). I\r\ndrew up a Paper on this, and gave it to the Cambridge Philosophical\r\nSociety on Nov. 24th. (My only academical Paper this year.)--I had\r\nseveral letters from Dr Young, partly supplying me with calculations\r\nthat I wanted, partly on reform or extension of the Nautical Almanac\r\n(which Dr Young resisted as much as possible). He considered me very\r\nunfairly treated in the dissolution of the Board of Longitude:\r\nProfessor Lax wished me to join in some effort for its restoration,\r\nbut I declined.\r\n\r\n\"As my reduction of observations was kept quite close, I now began to\r\nthink of printing. In regard to the form I determined to adopt a plan\r\ntotally different from that of any other observations which I had\r\nseen. The results were to be the important things: I was desirous of\r\nsuppressing the separate wires of transits. But upon consulting\r\nHerschel and other persons they would not agree to it, and I assented\r\nto keeping them. I applied to the Press Syndicate to print the work,\r\nand on Nov. 10th at the request of T. Musgrave (afterwards Archbishop\r\nof York) I sent a specimen of my MS.: on Nov. 11th they granted 250\r\ncopies, and the printing soon commenced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1829\r\n\r\n\"During a winter holiday at Playford I wrote out some investigations\r\nabout the orbits of comets, and on Jan. 23rd 1829 I returned to\r\nCambridge. The Smith's Prize Examination soon followed, in which I set\r\na Paper of questions as usual. On Feb. 18th I made notes on\r\nLiesganig's geodetic work at the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\"I was naturally anxious now about the settlement of my salary and of\r\nthe Observatory establishment. I do not know when the Syndicate made\r\ntheir Report, but it must have been in the last term of 1828. It\r\nrecommended that the salary should be annually made up (by Grace) to\r\n_£500_: that an Assistant should be appointed with the assent of the\r\nVice-Chancellor and dismissable by the Plumian Professor: and that a\r\nVisiting Syndicate should be appointed, partly official and partly of\r\npersons to be named every year by Grace. The Grace for adopting this\r\nReport was to be offered to the Senate on Feb. 27th. The passing of\r\nthe Grace was exposed to two considerable perils. First, I found out\r\n(just in time) that a Senior Fellow of Trinity (G.A. Browne) was\r\ndetermined to oppose the whole, on account of the insignificant clause\r\nregarding dismissal of Assistants, which he regarded as tyrannical. I\r\nat once undertook that that clause should be rejected. Secondly, by\r\nthe absurd constitution of the 'Caput' at Cambridge, a single M.A. had\r\nthe power of stopping any business whatever, and an M.A. actually\r\ncame to the Senate House with the intention of throwing out all the\r\nGraces on various business that day presented to the Senate. Luckily\r\nhe mistook the hour, and came at 11 instead of 10, and found that all\r\nwere dispatched. The important parts of the Grace passed without any\r\nopposition: but I mustered some friends who negatived that part which\r\nhad alarmed G.A. Browne, and it was corrected to his satisfaction by a\r\nnew Grace on Mar. 18th. I was now almost set at rest on one of the\r\ngreat objects of my life: but not quite. I did not regard, and I\r\ndetermined not to regard, the addition to my salary as absolutely\r\ncertain until a payment had been actually made to me: and I carefully\r\nabstained, for the present, from taking any steps based upon it. I\r\nfound for Assistant at the Observatory an old Lieutenant of the Royal\r\nNavy, Mr Baldrey, who came on Mar. 16.\r\n\r\n\"On May 4th I began lectures: there were 32 names. The Lectures were\r\nimproving, especially in the optical part. I do not find note of the\r\nday of termination.--I do not know the actual day of publication of my\r\nfirst small volume of Cambridge Observations, 1828, and of\r\ncirculation. The date of the preface is Apr. 27th 1829. I have letters\r\nof approval of it from Davies Gilbert, Rigaud, and Lax. The system\r\nwhich I endeavoured to introduce into printed astronomical\r\nobservations was partially introduced into this volume, and was\r\nsteadily improved in subsequent volumes. I think that I am justified,\r\nby letters and other remarks, in believing that this introduction of\r\nan orderly system of exhibition, not merely of observations but of the\r\nsteps for bringing them to a practical result--quite a novelty in\r\nastronomical publications--had a markedly good effect on European\r\nastronomy in general.--In Feb. and March I have letters from Young\r\nabout the Nautical Almanac: he was unwilling to make any great change,\r\nbut glad to receive any small assistance. South, who had been keeping\r\nup a series of attacks on Young, wrote to me to enquire how I stood in\r\nengagements of assistance to Young: I replied that I should assist\r\nYoung whenever he asked me, and that I disapproved of South's\r\ncourse.--The date of the first visitation of the (Cambridge)\r\nObservatory must have been near May 11th: I invited South and Baily to\r\nmy house; South and I were very near quarrelling about the treatment\r\nof Young.--In a few days after Dr Young died: I applied to Lord\r\nMelville for the superintendence of the Nautical Almanac: Mr Croker\r\nreplied that it devolved legally upon the Astronomer Royal, and on May\r\n30th Pond wrote to ask my assistance when I could give any. On June\r\n6th I was invited to the Greenwich Visitation, to which I believe I\r\nwent on the 10th.\r\n\r\n\"I had long desired to see Switzerland, and I wished now to see some\r\nof the Continental Observatories. I was therefore glad to arrange with\r\nMr Lodge, of Magdalene College (perhaps 10 years senior to myself), to\r\nmake a little tour. Capt. W.H. Smyth and others gave me\r\nintroductions. I met Lodge in London, and we started for Calais on\r\nJuly 27th 1829. We visited a number of towns in Belgium (at Brussels I\r\nsaw the beginning of the Observatory with Quetelet), and passed by\r\nCologne, Frankfort, Fribourg, and Basle to Zurich. Thus far we had\r\ntravelled by diligence or posting: we now procured a guide, and\r\ntravelled generally on foot. From the 13th to the 31st August we\r\ntravelled diligently through the well-known mountainous parts of\r\nSwitzerland and arrived at Geneva on the 31st August. Here I saw\r\nM. Gautier, M. Gambard, and the beginning of the Observatory. Mr\r\nLodge was now compelled to return to Cambridge, and I proceeded alone\r\nby Chambéry to Turin, where I made the acquaintance of M. Plana and\r\nsaw the Observatory. I then made a tour through north Italy, looking\r\nover the Observatories at Milan, Padua, Bologna, and Florence. At\r\nLeghorn I took a passage for Marseille in a xebeque, but after sailing\r\nfor three days the weather proved very unfavourable, and I landed at\r\nSpezia and proceeded by Genoa and the Cornici Road to Marseille. At\r\nMarseille I saw M. Gambart and the Observatory, and passed by Avignon,\r\nLyons, and Nevers to Orléans, where I visited my old host\r\nM. Legarde. Thence by Paris, Beauvais, and Calais to London and\r\nCambridge, where I arrived on the 30th October. I had started with\r\nmore than _£140_ and returned with _2s. 6d_. The expedition was in\r\nmany ways invaluable to me.\r\n\r\n\"On my return I found various letters from scientific men: some\r\napproving of my method for the mass of the Moon: some approving highly\r\nof my printed observations, especially D. Gilbert, who informed me\r\nthat they had produced good effect (I believe at Greenwich), and\r\nHerschel.--On Nov. 13th I gave the Royal Astronomical Society a Paper\r\nabout deducing the mass of the Moon from observations of Venus: on\r\nNov. 16th a Paper to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on a\r\ncorrection to the length of a ball-pendulum: and on Dec. 14th a Paper\r\non certain conditions under which perpetual motion is possible.--The\r\nengravings for my Figure of the Earth in the Encyclopaedia\r\nMetropolitana were dispatched at the end of the year. Some of the\r\nPaper (perhaps much) was written after my return from the\r\nContinent.--I began, but never finished, a Paper on the form of the\r\nEarth supposed to be projecting at middle latitudes. In this I refer\r\nto the printed Paper which Nicollet gave me at Paris. I believe that\r\nthe investigations for my Paper in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana led\r\nme to think the supposition unnecessary.--On Nov. 6th I was elected\r\nmember of the Geological Society.\r\n\r\n\"On Nov. 16th 1829 notice was given of a Grace to authorize payment to\r\nme of _£157. 9s. 1d._, in conformity with the regulations adopted on\r\nFeb. 27th, and on Nov. 18th the Grace passed the Senate. On Nov. 19th\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor wrote me a note enclosing the cheque. On Nov. 23rd\r\n(practically the first day on which I could go) I went to London and\r\ntravelled to Edensor, where I arrived on the 26th. Here I found\r\nRicharda Smith, proposed to her, and was accepted. I stayed there a\r\nfew days, and returned to Cambridge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1830\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 25th 1830 the Smith's Prize Paper was prepared. I was (with\r\nmy Assistant, Mr Baldrey) vigorously working the Transit Instrument\r\nand its reductions, and gradually forming a course of proceeding which\r\nhas had a good effect on European Astronomy. And I was preparing for\r\nmy marriage.\r\n\r\n\"On Mar. 11th I started with my sister to London, and arrived at\r\nEdensor on the afternoon of the 14th. On the 17th I started alone for\r\nManchester and Liverpool. Through Mr Mason, a cotton-spinner at\r\nCalver, near Edensor, I had become acquainted with Mr John Kennedy of\r\nManchester, and I had since 1824 been acquainted with Dr Traill of\r\nLiverpool. Amongst other things, I saw the works of the Manchester and\r\nLiverpool Railway, then advancing and exciting great interest, and saw\r\nGeorge Stephenson and his son. On Mar. 24th I was married to Richarda\r\nSmith by her father in Edensor. We stopped at Edensor till Apr. 1st,\r\nand then started in chaises by way of Newark and Kettering (where we\r\nwere in danger of being stopped by the snow), and arrived at Cambridge\r\non Apr. 3rd.\r\n\r\n\"I was now busy in preparing for lectures, especially the part of the\r\noptical lectures which related to the theory of interferences and\r\npolarization. I think it was now that my wife drew some of my lecture\r\npictures, exhibiting interference phenomena. My lectures began on\r\nApr. 26th and finished on May 24th. The number of names was 50. They\r\nwere considered an excellent course of lectures.\r\n\r\n\"May 9th is the date of my Preface to the 1829 Observations: all was\r\nthen printed. Apparently I did not go to the Visitation of the\r\nGreenwich Observatory this year.--I was at this time pressing Tulley,\r\nthe optician, about an object-glass for the Mural Circle.--A new\r\nedition of my 'Tracts' was wanted, and I prepared to add a Tract on\r\nthe Undulatory Theory of Light in its utmost extent. The Syndicate of\r\nthe University Press intimated through Dr Turton that they could not\r\nassist me (regarding the book as a second edition). On July 10th I\r\nhave some negociation about it with Deighton the bookseller.--On May\r\n18th I have a note from Whewell about a number of crystals of\r\nplagiedral quartz, in which he was to observe the crystalline\r\nindication, and I the optical phenomena.--The Report of the Syndicate\r\nfor visiting the Observatory is dated June 18th: it is highly\r\nlaudatory.--The Proctor (Barnard of King's College) requested me to\r\nname the Moderator for the next B.A. Examination: I named Mr Challis.\r\n\r\n\"On June 14th my wife and I went, in company with Professor and Mrs\r\nHenslow, to London and Oxford; at Oxford we were received in\r\nChristchurch College by Dr and Mrs Buckland. My wife and I then went\r\nto Bedford to visit Capt. and Mrs Smyth, and returned to Cambridge on\r\nthe 23rd. On July 5th we went on a visit to my mother and uncle at\r\nPlayford. While there I took a drive with my uncle into some parts\r\nnear the valley of the Gipping, in which I thought that the extent of\r\nthe chalk was inadequately exhibited on Greenough's map, and\r\ncommunicated my remarks to Buckland.\r\n\r\n\"I find letters from Dr Robinson and Col. Colby about determining\r\nlongitudes of certain observatories by fire signals: I proposed\r\nchronometers as preferable. Also from Herschel, approving of my second\r\nvolume of observations: and from F. Baily, disclaiming the origination\r\nof the attack on the old Nautical Almanac (with which I suppose I had\r\nreproached him). On July 30th I received a summons from South to a\r\ncommittee for improving the Nautical Almanac; and subsequently a\r\nletter from Baily about Schumacher's taking offence at a passage of\r\nmine in the Cambridge Observations, on the comparative merits of\r\nEphemerides, which I afterwards explained to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"On Aug. 24th my wife and I started for Edensor, and after a short\r\nstay there proceeded by Manchester to Cumberland, where we made many\r\nexcursions. We returned by Edensor, and reached Cambridge on Oct. 6th,\r\nbringing my wife's sister Susanna on a visit. My mother had\r\ndetermined, as soon as my intention of marriage was known to her, to\r\nquit the house, although always (even to her death) entertaining the\r\nmost friendly feelings and fondness for my wife. It was also judged\r\nbest by us all that my sister should not reside with us as a settled\r\ninhabitant of the house. They fixed themselves therefore at Playford\r\nin the farm-house of the Luck's Farm, then in the occupation of my\r\nuncle Arthur Biddell. On Oct. 21st I have a letter from my sister\r\nsaying that they were comfortably settled there.\r\n\r\n\"In this month of October (principally, I believe) I made some capital\r\nExperiments on Quartz, which were treated mathematically in a Paper\r\ncommunicated in the next year to the Cambridge Philosophical\r\nSociety. In some of these my wife assisted me, and also drew\r\npictures.--On Nov. 15th the Grace for paying me _£198. 13s. 8d._ to\r\nmake my income up to _£500_ passed the Senate.--I made three journeys\r\nto London to attend committees, one a committee on the Nautical\r\nAlmanac, and one a Royal Society Committee about two southern\r\nobservatories.--On Dec. 31st I have a letter from Maclear (medical\r\npractitioner and astronomer at Biggleswade) about occultations.--In\r\nthis December I had a quartz object-glass by Cauchaix mounted by\r\nDollond, and presented it to the Observatory.--In this December\r\noccurred the alarm from agrarian fires. There was a very large fire at\r\nCoton, about a mile from the Observatory. This created the most\r\nextraordinary panic that I ever saw. I do not think it is possible,\r\nwithout having witnessed it, to conceive the state of men's minds. The\r\ngownsmen were all armed with bludgeons, and put under a rude\r\ndiscipline for a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1831\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 4th I went with my wife, first to Miss Sheepshanks in London,\r\nat 30, Woburn Place, and next to the house of my wife's old friend,\r\nthe Rev. John Courtney, at Sanderstead, near Croydon. I came to London\r\non one day to attend a meeting of the new Board of Visitors of the\r\nGreenwich Observatory. Formerly the Board of Visitors consisted of the\r\nCouncil of the Royal Society with persons invited by them (in which\r\ncapacity I had often attended). But a reforming party, of which\r\nSouth, Babbage, Baily and Beaufort were prominent members, had induced\r\nthe Admiralty to constitute a new Board, of which the Plumian\r\nProfessor was a member. Mr Pond, the Astronomer Royal, was in a rather\r\nfeeble state, and South seemed determined to bear him down:\r\nSheepshanks and I did our best to support him. (I have various letters\r\nfrom Sheepshanks to this purpose.)--On Jan. 22nd we returned to\r\nCambridge, and I set an Examination Paper for Smith's Prizes as\r\nusual.--On Jan. 30th I have a letter from Herschel about improving\r\nthe arrangement of Pond's Observations. I believe that much of this\r\nzeal arose from the example of the Cambridge Observations.\r\n\r\n\"On Feb. 21st my Paper 'On the nature of the light in the two rays of\r\nQuartz' was communicated to the Philosophical Society: a capital piece\r\nof deductive optics. On Mar. 2nd I went to London, I suppose to\r\nattend the Board of Visitors (which met frequently, for the proposed\r\nreform of Pond's Observations, &c.). As I returned on the outside of\r\nthe coach there occurred to me a very remarkable deduction from my\r\nideas about the rays of Quartz, which I soon tried with success, and\r\nit is printed as an Appendix to the Paper above mentioned. On Mar. 6th\r\nmy son George Richard was born.\"\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous matters in the first half of this year are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Faraday sends me a piece of glass for Amici (he had sent me a piece\r\nbefore).--On Apr. 9th I dispatched the Preface of my 1830\r\nObservations: this implies that all was printed.--On Apr. 18th I began\r\nmy Lectures and finished on May 24th. There were 49 names. A very good\r\nseries of lectures.--I think it was immediately after this, at the\r\nVisitation of the Cambridge Observatory, that F. Baily and Lieut.\r\nStratford were present, and that Sheepshanks went to Tharfield on the\r\nRoyston Downs to fire powder signals to be seen at Biggleswade (by\r\nMaclear) and at Bedford (by Capt. Smyth) as well as by us at\r\nCambridge.--On May 14th I received _£100_ for my article on the Figure\r\nof the Earth from Baldwin the publisher of the Encyclopaedia\r\nMetropolitana.--I attended the Greenwich Visitation on June 3rd.--On\r\nJune 30th the Observatory Syndicate made their report: satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"On July 6th 1831 I started with my wife and infant son for Edensor,\r\nand went on alone to Liverpool. I left for Dublin on the day on which\r\nthe loss of the 'Rothsay Castle' was telegraphed, and had a bad\r\nvoyage, which made me ill during my whole absence. After a little stay\r\nin Dublin I went to Armagh to visit Dr Robinson, and thence to\r\nColeraine and the Giant's Causeway, returning by Belfast and Dublin to\r\nEdensor. We returned to Cambridge on Sept. 9th.\r\n\r\n\"Up to this time the Observatory was furnished with only one large\r\ninstrument, namely the 10-foot Transit. On Feb. 24th of this year I\r\nhad received from Thomas Jones (62, Charing Cross) a sketch of the\r\nstone pier for mounting the Equatoreal which he was commissioned to\r\nmake: and the pier was prepared in the spring or summer. On Sept. 20th\r\npart of the instrument was sent to the Observatory; other parts\r\nfollowed, and Jones himself came to mount it. On Sept. 16th I received\r\nSimms's assurance that he was hastening the Mural Circle.--In this\r\nautumn I seriously took up the recalculation of my Long Inequality of\r\nVenus and the Earth, and worked through it independently; thus\r\ncorrecting two errors. On Nov. 10th I went to Slough, to put my Paper\r\nin the hands of Mr Herschel for communication to the Royal\r\nSociety. The Paper was read on Nov. 24th.--This was the year of the\r\nfirst Meeting of the British Association at York. The next year's\r\nmeeting was to be at Oxford, and on Oct. 17th I received from the\r\nRev. W. Vernon Harcourt an invitation to supply a Report on Astronomy,\r\nwhich I undertook: it employed me much of the winter, and the\r\nsucceeding spring and summer.--The second edition of my Tracts was\r\nready in October. It contained, besides what was in the first edition,\r\nthe Planetary Theory, and the Undulatory Theory of Light. The Profit\r\nwas _£80_.--On Nov. 14th I presented to the Cambridge Philosophical\r\nSociety a Paper 'On a remarkable modification of Newton's Rings': a\r\npretty good Paper.--In November the Copley Medal was awarded to me by\r\nthe Royal Society for my advances in Optics.--Amongst miscellaneous\r\nmatters I was engaged in correspondence with Col. Colby and\r\nCapt. Portlock about the Irish Triangulation and its calculation. Also\r\nwith the Admiralty on the form of publication of the Greenwich and\r\nCape Observations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1832\r\n\r\n\"In January my Examination Paper for Smith's Prizes was prepared as\r\nusual.--Two matters (in addition to the daily routine of Observatory\r\nwork) occupied me at the beginning of this year. One was the\r\ntranslation of Encke's Paper in successive numbers of the\r\nAstronomische Nachrichten concerning Encke's Comet; the University\r\nPress printed this gratuitously, and I distributed copies, partly by\r\nthe aid of Capt. Beaufort.--The other was the Report on Astronomy for\r\nthe British Association, which required much labour. My reading for\r\nit was principally in the University Library (possibly some in\r\nLondon), but I borrowed some books from F. Baily, and I wrote to\r\nCapt. Beaufort about the possible repetition of Lacaille's Meridian\r\nArc at the Cape of Good Hope. The Report appears to have been finished\r\non May 2nd.--At this time the Reform Bill was under discussion, and\r\none letter written by me (probably at Sheepshanks's request) addressed\r\nI think to Mr Drummond, Lord Althorp's secretary, was read in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\n\"Optics were not neglected. I have some correspondence with Brewster\r\nand Faraday. On Mar. 5th I gave the Cambridge Philosophical Society a\r\nPaper 'On a new Analyzer,' and on Mar. 19th one 'On Newton's Rings\r\nbetween two substances of different refractive powers,' both Papers\r\nsatisfactory to myself.--On the death of Mr F. Fallows, astronomer at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope Observatory, the Admiralty appointed Mr\r\nHenderson, an Edinburgh lawyer, who had done some little things in\r\nastronomical calculation. On Jan. 10th I discussed with him\r\nobservations to be made, and drew up his Official Instructions which\r\nwere sent on Jan. 10th.--On Feb. 16th Sir James South writes that\r\nEncke's Comet is seen: also that with his 12-inch achromatic,\r\npurchased at Paris, and which he was preparing to mount equatoreally,\r\nhe had seen the disk of Aldebaran apparently bisected by the Moon's\r\nlimb.--Capt. Beaufort and D. Gilbert write in March about instructions\r\nto Dunlop, the astronomer at Paramatta. I sent a draft to\r\nCapt. Beaufort on Apr. 27th.\r\n\r\n\"The Preface to my 1831 Observations is dated Mar. 20th. The\r\ndistribution of the book would be a few weeks later.--On May 7th I\r\nbegan my Lectures: 51 names: I finished on May 29th.--The mounting of\r\nthe Equatoreal was finished some time before the Syndicate Visitation\r\nat the end of May, but Jones's charge appeared to be exorbitant: I\r\nbelieve it was paid at last, but it was considered unfair.--On June\r\n2nd I went to London: I presume to the Greenwich Visitation.--I went\r\nto Oxford to the meeting of the British Association (lodging I think\r\nwith Prof. Rigaud at the Observatory) on June 16th, and read part of\r\nmy Report on Astronomy in the Theatre.\r\n\r\n\"On June 26th I started with my wife for the Highlands of\r\nScotland. After a short stay at Edensor, we went by Carlisle to\r\nGlasgow, and through the Lake District to Inverness. Thence by\r\nAuchnanault to Balmacarra, where we were received by Mr\r\nLillingstone. After an expedition in Skye, we returned to Balmacarra,\r\nand passed on to Invermoriston, where we were received by Grant of\r\nGlenmoriston. We then went to Fort William and Oban, and crossed over\r\nto Mull, where we were received by Maclean of Loch Buy. We returned to\r\nOban and on to Edinburgh, where we made a short stay. Then to Melrose,\r\nwhere we were received by Sir D. Brewster, and by Edensor to\r\nCambridge, where we arrived on Sept. 17th.\r\n\r\n\"I received (at Edinburgh I believe) a letter from Arago, writing for\r\nthe plans of our observing-room shutters.--Mr Vernon Harcourt wrote\r\ndeprecating the tone of my Report on Astronomy as related to English\r\nAstronomers, but I refused to alter a word.--Sheepshanks wrote in\r\nSeptember in great anxiety about the Cambridge Circle, for which he\r\nthought the pier ought to be raised: I would have no such thing, and\r\narranged it much more conveniently by means of a pit. On Oct. 9th\r\nSimms says that he will come with the circle immediately, and Jones on\r\nSept. 29th says that he will make some alteration in the equatoreal:\r\nthus there was at last a prospect of furnishing the Observatory\r\nproperly.--On Oct. 9th, I have Encke's thanks for the translation of\r\nthe Comet Paper.--One of the desiderata which I had pointed out in my\r\nReport on Astronomy was the determination of the mass of Jupiter by\r\nelongations of the 4th satellite: and as the Equatoreal of the\r\nCambridge Observatory was on the point of coming into use, I\r\ndetermined to employ it for this purpose. It was necessary for the\r\nreduction of the observations that I should prepare Tables of the\r\nmotion of Jupiter's 4th Satellite in a form applicable to computations\r\nof differences of right-ascension. The date of my Tables is Oct. 3rd,\r\n1832.--In October the Observatory Syndicate made their Report: quite\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"On Oct. 20th Sheepshanks wrote asking my assistance in the Penny\r\nCyclopaedia: I did afterwards write 'Gravitation' and 'Greenwich.'\r\n--Capt. Beaufort wrote in November to ask my opinion on the\r\nPreface to an edition of Groombridge's Catalogue which had been\r\nprepared by H. Taylor: Sheepshanks also wrote; he had objected to\r\nit. This was the beginning of an affair which afterwards gave me great\r\nlabour.--Vernon Harcourt writes, much offended at some terms which I\r\nhad used in reference to an office in the British Association.\r\n\r\n\"The Equatoreal mounting which Troughton and Simms had been preparing\r\nfor Sir James South's large telescope had not entirely succeeded. I\r\nhave various letters at this time from Sheepshanks and Simms, relating\r\nto the disposition which Sir James South shewed to resist every claim\r\ntill compelled by law to pay it.--A general election of Members of\r\nParliament was now coming on: Mr Lubbock was candidate for the\r\nUniversity. On Nov. 27th I had a letter from Sedgwick requesting me to\r\nwrite a letter in the newspapers in favour of Lubbock; which I did. On\r\nDec. 7th I have notice of the County voting at Newmarket on Dec. 18th\r\nand 19th: I walked there to vote for Townley; he lost the election by\r\ntwo or three votes in several thousands.\r\n\r\n\"The Mural Circle was now nearly ready in all respects, and it was\r\nknown that another Assistant would be required. Mr Richardson (one of\r\nthe Assistants of Greenwich Observatory) and Mr Simms recommended to\r\nme Mr Glaisher, who was soon after appointed, and subsequently became\r\nan Assistant at Greenwich.--On Dec. 24th I have a letter from Bessel\r\n(the first I believe). I think that I had written to him about a\r\ngeneral reduction of the Greenwich Planetary Observations, using his\r\nTabulae Regiomontanae as basis, and that this was his reply approving\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1833\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 4th 1833 my daughter Elizabeth was born.--I prepared an\r\nexamination paper for Smith's Prizes as usual.--On Jan. 5th I received\r\nnotice from Simms that he had received payment (_£1050_) for the Mural\r\nCircle from the Vice-Chancellor. About this time the Circle was\r\ncompletely made serviceable, and I (with Mr Glaisher as Assistant)\r\nimmediately began its use. A puzzling apparent defect in the circle\r\n(exhibiting itself by the discordance of zenith points obtained by\r\nreflection observations on opposite sides of the zenith) shewed itself\r\nvery early. On Feb. 4th I have letters about it from Sheepshanks and\r\nSimms.--On Jan. 17th I received notice from F. Baily that the\r\nAstronomical Society had awarded me their Medal for my long inequality\r\nof Venus and the Earth: on Feb. 7th I went to London, I suppose to\r\nreceive the Medal.--I also inspected Sir J. South's telescope, then\r\nbecoming a matter of litigation, and visited Mr Herschel at Slough: on\r\nFeb. 12th I wrote to Sir J. South about the support of the\r\ninstrument, hoping to remove one of the difficulties in the\r\nlitigation; but it produced no effect.--Herschel wrote to me, from\r\nPoisson, that Pontécoulant had verified my Long Inequality.\r\n\r\n\"Mar. 12th is the date of the Preface to my 1832 volume of\r\nObservations: it was of course distributed a few weeks later.--In my\r\nReport on Astronomy I had indicated the Mass of Jupiter as a subject\r\nrequiring fresh investigation. During the last winter I had well\r\nemployed the Equatoreal in observing elongations in R.A. of the 4th\r\nSatellite. To make these available it was necessary to work up the\r\ntheory carefully, in which I discovered some remarkable errors of\r\nLaplace. Some of these, for verification, I submitted to Mr Lubbock,\r\nwho entirely agreed with me. The date of my first calculations of the\r\nMass of Jupiter is Mar. 1st: and shortly after that I gave an oral\r\naccount of them to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. The date of my\r\nPaper for the Astronomical Society is April 12th. The result of my\r\ninvestigations (which was subsequently confirmed by Bessel) entirely\r\nremoved the difficulty among Astronomers; and the mass which I\r\nobtained has ever since been received as the true one.\r\n\r\n\"On Apr. 9th my wife's two sisters, Elizabeth and Georgiana Smith,\r\ncame to stay with me.--On Apr. 22nd I began lectures, and finished on\r\nMay 21st: there were 54 names. During the course of the lectures I\r\ncommunicated a Paper to the Philosophical Society 'On the calculation\r\nof Newton's experiments on Diffraction.'--I went to London on the\r\nVisitation of the Greenwich Observatory: the dinner had been much\r\nrestricted, but was now made more open.--It had been arranged that the\r\nmeeting of the British Association was to be held this year at\r\nCambridge. I invited Sir David Brewster and Mr Herschel to lodge at\r\nthe Observatory. The meeting lasted from June 24th to 30th. We gave\r\none dinner, but had a breakfast party every day. I did not enter much\r\ninto the scientific business of the meeting, except that I brought\r\nbefore the Committee the expediency of reducing the Greenwich\r\nPlanetary Observations from 1750. They agreed to represent it to the\r\nGovernment, and a deputation was appointed (I among them) who were\r\nreceived by Lord Althorp on July 25th. On Aug. 3rd Herschel announced\r\nto me that _£500_ was granted.\r\n\r\n\"On Aug. 7th I started with my wife for Edensor. At Leicester we met\r\nSedgwick and Whewell: my wife went on to Edensor, and I joined\r\nSedgwick and Whewell in a geological expedition to Mount Sorrel and\r\nvarious parts of Charnwood Forest. We were received by Mr Allsop of\r\nWoodlands, who proved an estimable acquaintance. This lasted four or\r\nfive days, and we then went on to Edensor.--On Aug. 15th Herschel\r\nwrote to me, communicating an offer of the Duke of Northumberland to\r\npresent to the Cambridge Observatory an object-glass of about 12\r\ninches aperture by Cauchaix. I wrote therefore to the Duke, accepting\r\ngenerally. The Duke wrote to me from Buxton on Aug. 23rd (his letter,\r\nsuch was the wretched arrangement of postage, reaching Bakewell and\r\nEdensor on the 25th) and on the 26th I drove before breakfast to\r\nBuxton and had an interview with him. On Sept. 1st the Duke wrote,\r\nauthorizing me to mount the telescope entirely, and he subsequently\r\napproved of Cauchaix's terms: there was much correspondence, but on\r\nDec. 28th I instructed Cauchaix how to send the telescope.--On our\r\nreturn we paid a visit to Dr Davy, Master of Caius College, at\r\nHeacham, and reached Cambridge on Oct. 8th.\r\n\r\n\"Groombridge's Catalogue, of which the editing was formally entrusted\r\nto Mr Henry Taylor (son of Taylor the first-assistant of the Greenwich\r\nObservatory), had been in some measure referred to Sheepshanks: and\r\nhe, in investigating the work, found reason for thinking the whole\r\ndiscreditable. About May he first wrote to me on his rising quarrel\r\nwith H. Taylor, but on Sept. 7th he found things coming to a crisis,\r\nand denounced the whole. Capt. Beaufort the Hydrographer (in whose\r\noffice this matter rested) begged me with Baily to decide upon it. We\r\ndid not at first quite agree upon the terms of investigation &c., but\r\nafter a time all was settled, and on Oct. 4th the Admiralty formally\r\napplied, and I formally accepted. Little or nothing had been done by\r\nMr Baily and myself, when my work was interrupted by illness.\r\n\r\n\"Sheepshanks had thought that something might be done to advance the\r\ninterests of myself or the Observatory by the favour of Lord Brougham\r\n(then Lord Chancellor), and had urged me to write an article in the\r\nPenny Cyclopaedia, in which Lord Brougham took great interest. I chose\r\nthe subject 'Gravitation,' and as I think wrote a good deal of it in\r\nthis Autumn: when it was interrupted by my illness.\r\n\r\n\"On Dec. 9th 1833, having at first intended to attend the meeting of\r\nthe Philosophical Society and then having changed my mind, I was\r\nengaged in the evening on the formulae for effects of small errors on\r\nthe computation of the Solar Eclipse of 1833. A dizziness in my head\r\ncame on. I left off work, became worse, and went to bed, and in the\r\nnight was in high fever with a fierce attack of scarlet fever. My wife\r\nwas also attacked but very slightly. The first day of quitting my\r\nbedroom was Dec. 31st. Somewhere about the time of my illness my\r\nwife's sister, Susanna Smith, who was much reduced in the summer, died\r\nof consumption.\r\n\r\n\"Miscellaneous notes in 1833 are as follows: Henderson (at the Cape)\r\ncould not endure it much longer, and on Oct. 14th Stratford writes\r\nthat Maclear had just sailed to take his place: Henderson is candidate\r\nfor the Edinburgh Observatory.--Stratford writes on Dec. 2nd that the\r\nMadras observations have come to England, the first whose arrangement\r\nimitates mine.--On Nov. 3rd Herschel, just going to the Cape,\r\nentrusted to me the revisal of some proof sheets, if necessary:\r\nhowever it was never needed.--In November I sat for my portrait to a\r\npainter named Purdon (I think): he came to the house and made a good\r\nlikeness. A pencil portrait was taken for a print-seller (Mason) in\r\nCambridge: it was begun before my illness and finished after it.--I\r\napplied through Sheepshanks for a copy of Maskelyne's Observations, to\r\nbe used in the Reduction of the Planetary Observations: and on\r\nDec. 24th (from my bedroom) I applied through Prof. Rigaud to the\r\nDelegates of the Clarendon Press for a copy of Bradley's Observations\r\nfor the same. The latter request was refused. In October I applied to\r\nthe Syndics of the University Press for printed forms for these\r\nReductions: the Syndics agreed to grant me 12,000 copies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1834\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 11th 1834 I went with my wife to London for the recruiting of\r\nmy strength. We stayed at the house of our friend Miss Sheepshanks,\r\nand returned on Feb. 13th.--I drew up a Paper of Questions for Smith's\r\nPrizes, but left the whole trouble of examination and adjudication to\r\nProfessor Miller, who at my request acted for me.--While I was in\r\nLondon I began to look at the papers relating to Groombridge's\r\nCatalogue: and I believe that it was while in London that I agreed\r\nwith Mr Baily on a Report condemnatory of H. Taylor's edition, and\r\nsent the Report to the Admiralty. The Admiralty asked for further\r\nadvice, and on Feb. 28th I replied, undertaking to put the Catalogue\r\nin order. On Mar. 17th Capt. Beaufort sent me all the papers. Some\r\ntime however elapsed before I could proceed with it.\r\n\r\n\"There was in this spring a furious discussion about the admission of\r\nDissenters into the University: I took the Liberal side. On Apr. 30th\r\nthere was a letter of mine in the Cambridge newspaper.--On Apr. 14th I\r\nbegan lectures, and finished on May 20th: there were 87 names.--My\r\n'Gravitation' was either finished or so nearly finished that on Jan.\r\n24th I had some conversation with Knight the publisher about printing\r\nit. It was printed in the spring, and on Apr. 27th Sheepshanks sent a\r\ncopy of it to Lord Brougham. I received from Knight _£83. 17s. 1d._\r\nfor this Paper.--On May 10th I went to London, I believe to attend one\r\nof the Soirées which the Duke of Sussex gave as President of the Royal\r\nSociety. The Duke invited me to breakfast privately with him the next\r\nmorning. He then spoke to me, on the part of the Government, about my\r\ntaking the office of Astronomer Royal. On May 19th I wrote him a\r\nsemi-official letter, to which reference was made in subsequent\r\ncorrespondence on that subject.\r\n\r\n\"On May 12th my son Arthur was born.--In June the Observatory\r\nSyndicate made a satisfied Report.--On June 7th I went to the\r\nGreenwich Visitation, and again on June 14th I went to London, I\r\nbelieve for the purpose of trying the mounting of South's telescope,\r\nas it had been strengthened by Mr Simms by Sheepshanks's\r\nsuggestions. I was subsequently in correspondence with Sheepshanks on\r\nthe subject of the Arbitration on South's telescope, and my giving\r\nevidence on it. On July 29th, as I was shortly going away, I wrote him\r\na Report on the Telescope, to be used in case of my absence. The\r\naward, which was given in December, was entirely in favour of\r\nSimms.--On July 23rd I went out, I think to my brother's marriage at\r\nIxworth in Suffolk.--On Aug. 1st I started for Edensor and Cumberland,\r\nwith my wife, sister, and three children: Georgiana Smith joined us at\r\nEdensor. We went by Otley, Harrogate, Ripon, and Stanmoor to Keswick,\r\nfrom whence we made many excursions. On Aug. 11th I went with Whewell\r\nto the clouds on Skiddaw, to try hygrometers. Mr Baily called on his\r\nway to the British Association at Edinburgh. On Sept. 10th we\r\ntransferred our quarters to Ambleside, and after various excursions we\r\nreturned to Edensor by Skipton and Bolton. On Sept. 19th I went to\r\nDoncaster and Finningley Park to see Mr Beaumont's Observatory. On\r\nSept. 25th we posted in one day from Edensor to Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\"On Aug. 25th Mr Spring Rice (Lord Monteagle) wrote to me to enquire\r\nwhether I would accept the office of Astronomer Royal if it were\r\nvacant. I replied (from Keswick) on Aug. 30th, expressing my general\r\nwillingness, stipulating for my freedom of vote, &c., and referring to\r\nmy letter to the Duke of Sussex. On Oct. 8th Lord Auckland, First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty, wrote: and on Oct. 10th I provisionally accepted the\r\noffice. On Oct. 30th I wrote to ask for leave to give a course of\r\nlectures at Cambridge in case that my successor at Cambridge should\r\nfind difficulty in doing it in the first year: and to this Lord\r\nAuckland assented on Oct. 31st. All this arrangement was for a time\r\nupset by the change of Ministry which shortly followed.\r\n\r\n\"Amongst miscellaneous matters, in March I had some correspondence\r\nwith the Duke of Northumberland about the Cauchaix Telescope. In\r\nAugust I had to announce to him that the flint-lens had been a little\r\nshattered in Cauchaix's shop and required regrinding: finally on\r\nDec. 17th I announced its arrival at Cambridge.--In the Planetary\r\nReductions, I find that I employed one computer (Glaisher) for 34\r\nweeks.--In November the Lalande Medal was awarded to me by the French\r\nInstitut, and Mr Pentland conveyed it to me in December.--On March\r\n14th I gave the Cambridge Philosophical Society a Paper, 'Continuation\r\nof researches into the value of Jupiter's Mass.'

Peel was now Prime Minister as First Lord of the Treasury, and Lord\r\nLyndhurst was Lord Chancellor. On Jan. 19th I wrote to Lord\r\nLyndhurst, asking him for a Suffolk living for my brother William,\r\nwhich he declined to give, though he remembered my application some\r\nyears later. Whether my application led to the favour which I shortly\r\nreceived from the Government, I do not know. But, in dining with the\r\nDuke of Sussex in the last year, I had been introduced to Sir R. Peel,\r\nand he had conversed with me a long time, and appeared to have heard\r\nfavourably of me. On Feb. 17th he wrote to me an autograph letter\r\noffering a pension of _£300_ per annum, with no terms of any kind, and\r\nallowing it to be settled if I should think fit on my wife. I wrote\r\non Feb. 18th accepting it for my wife. In a few days the matter went\r\nthrough the formal steps, and Mr Whewell and Mr Sheepshanks were\r\nnominated trustees for my wife. The subject came before Parliament, by\r\nthe Whig Party vindicating their own propriety in having offered me\r\nthe office of Astronomer Royal in the preceding year; and Spring\r\nRice's letter then written to me was published in the Times, &c.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe correspondence relating to the pension above-mentioned is given\r\nbelow, and appears to be of interest, both as conveying in very\r\nfelicitous terms the opinion of a very eminent statesman on the\r\ngeneral subject of such pensions, and as a most convincing proof of\r\nthe lofty position in Science which the subject of this Memoir had\r\nthen attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    WHITEHALL GARDENS,\r\n                                                     _Feb. 17 1835_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYou probably are aware that in a Resolution voted by the House of\r\nCommons in the last Session of Parliament, an opinion was expressed,\r\nthat Pensions on the Civil List, ought not thereafter to be granted by\r\nthe Crown excepting for the satisfaction of certain public claims,\r\namong which those resting on Scientific or Literary Eminence were\r\nespecially mentioned.\r\n\r\nI trust that no such Resolution would have been necessary to induce me\r\nas Minister of the Crown fully to recognize the justice of such\r\nclaims, but I refer to the Resolution, as removing every impediment to\r\na Communication of the nature of that which I am about to make to you.\r\n\r\nIn acting upon the Principle of the Resolution in so far as the Claims\r\nof Science are concerned, my _first_ address is made to you, and made\r\ndirectly, and without previous communication with any other person,\r\nbecause it is dictated exclusively by public considerations, and\r\nbecause there can be no advantage in or any motive for indirect\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nI consider you to have the first claim on the Royal Favour which\r\nEminence in those high Pursuits to which your life is devoted, can\r\ngive, and I fear that the Emoluments attached to your appointment in\r\nthe University of Cambridge are hardly sufficient to relieve you from\r\nanxiety as to the Future on account of those in whose welfare you are\r\ndeeply interested.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Civil List would enable me to advise the King to\r\ngrant a pension of three hundred pounds per annum, and if the offer be\r\nacceptable to you the Pension shall be granted either to Mrs Airy or\r\nyourself as you may prefer.\r\n\r\nI beg you distinctly to understand that your acquiescence in this\r\nProposal, will impose upon you no obligation personal or political in\r\nthe slightest degree. I make it solely upon public grounds, and I ask\r\nyou, by the acceptance of it, to permit the King to give some slight\r\nencouragement to Science, by proving to those who may be disposed to\r\nfollow your bright Example, that Devotion to the highest Branches of\r\nMathematical and Astronomical Knowledge shall not necessarily involve\r\nthem in constant solicitude as to the future condition of those, for\r\nwhom the application of the same Talents to more lucrative Pursuits\r\nwould have ensured an ample Provision.\r\n\r\n        I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n          With true Respect and Esteem,\r\n            Your faithful Servant,\r\n              ROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr Professor Airy,\r\n  &c., &c.,\r\n    Cambridge_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE,\r\n                                                    _1835, Feb. 18_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 17th acquainting me\r\nwith your intention of advising the King to grant a pension of _£300_\r\nper annum from the Civil List to me or Mrs Airy.\r\n\r\nI trust you will believe that I am sensible of the flattering terms in\r\nwhich this offer is made, and deeply grateful for the considerate\r\nmanner in which the principal arrangement is left to my choice, as\r\nwell as for the freedom from engagement in which your offer leaves\r\nme. I beg to state that I most willingly accept the offer. I should\r\nprefer that the pension be settled on Mrs Airy (by which I understand\r\nthat in case of her surviving me the pension would be continued to her\r\nduring her life, or in the contrary event would cease with her life).\r\n\r\nI wish that I may have the good fortune to prove to the world that I\r\ndo not accept this offer without an implied engagement on my part. I\r\nbeg leave again to thank you for your attention, and to assure you\r\nthat the form in which it is conveyed makes it doubly acceptable.\r\n\r\n        With sincere respect I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n          Your very faithful Servant,\r\n            G.B.

We visited Dublin Observatory, and then went direct to\r\nMarkree near Sligo, to see Mr Cooper's telescope (our principal\r\nobject). We passed on our return by Enniskillen and Ballyjamesduff,\r\nwhere my former pupil P. Morton was living, and returned on\r\nApr. 3rd.--On Apr. 20th I was elected to the Royal Society,\r\nEdinburgh.--Apr. 22nd my wife wrote me from Edensor that her sister\r\nFlorence was very ill: she died shortly after.--On May 4th I began\r\nlectures and finished on May 29th: there were 58 names.--My former\r\npupil Guest asks my interest for the Recordership of Birmingham.--In\r\nJune was circulated the Syndicate Report on the Observatory.--The date\r\nof the Preface to the 1834 Observations is June 16th.\r\n\r\n\"The Ministry had been again changed in the spring, and the Whigs were\r\nagain in power. On June 11th Lord Auckland, who was again First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty (as last year), again wrote to me to offer me the\r\noffice of Astronomer Royal, or to request my suggestions on the\r\nfilling up of the office. On June 15th I wrote my first reply, and on\r\nJune 17th wrote to accept it. On June 18th Lord Auckland acknowledges,\r\nand on June 22nd the King approved. Lord Auckland appointed to see me\r\non Friday, June 23rd, but I was unwell. I had various correspondence\r\nwith Lord Auckland, principally about buildings, and had an\r\nappointment with him for August 13th. As Lord Auckland was just\r\nquitting office, to go to India, I was introduced to Mr Charles Wood,\r\nthe Secretary of the Admiralty, with whom principally the subsequent\r\nbusiness was transacted. At this meeting Lord Auckland and Mr Wood\r\nexpressed their feeling, that the Observatory had fallen into such a\r\nstate of disrepute that the whole establishment ought to be cleared\r\nout. I represented that I could make it efficient with a good First\r\nAssistant; and the other Assistants were kept. But the establishment\r\nwas in a queer state. The Royal Warrant under the Sign Manual was sent\r\non August 11th. It was understood that my occupation of office would\r\ncommence on October 1st, but repairs and alterations of buildings\r\nwould make it impossible for me to reside at Greenwich before the end\r\nof the year. On Oct. 1st I went to the Observatory, and entered\r\nformally upon the office (though not residing for some time). Oct 7th\r\nis the date of my Official Instructions.\r\n\r\n\"I had made it a condition of accepting the office that the then First\r\nAssistant should be removed, and accordingly I had the charge of\r\nseeking another. I determined to have a man who had taken a\r\nrespectable Cambridge degree. I made enquiry first of Mr Bowstead\r\n(brother to the bishop) and Mr Steventon: at length, consulting Mr\r\nHopkins (a well-known private tutor at Cambridge), he recommended to\r\nme Mr Robert Main, of Queens' College, with whom I corresponded in the\r\nmonth (principally) of August, and whom on August 30th I nominated to\r\nthe Admiralty. On Oct. 21st F.W. Simms, one of the Assistants (who\r\napparently had hoped for the office of First Assistant, for which he\r\nwas quite incompetent) resigned; and on Dec. 4th I appointed in his\r\nplace Mr James Glaisher, who had been at Cambridge from the beginning\r\nof 1833, and on Dec. 10th the Admiralty approved.\r\n\r\n\"During this quarter of a year I was residing at Cambridge\r\nObservatory, visiting Greenwich once a week (at least for some time),\r\nthe immediate superintendence of the Observatory being placed with Mr\r\nMain. I was however engaged in reforming the system of the Greenwich\r\nObservatory, and prepared and printed 30 skeleton forms for reductions\r\nof observations and other business. On Dec. 14th I resigned my\r\nProfessorship to the Vice-Chancellor. But I continued the reduction of\r\nthe observations, so that not a single figure was left to my\r\nsuccessor: the last observations were those of Halley's Comet. The\r\nPreface to my 1835 Cambridge Observations is dated Aug. 22nd, 1836.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the Northumberland Telescope, I had for some time been\r\nspeculating on plans of mounting and enclosing the instrument, and had\r\ncorresponded with Simms, A. Biddell, Cubitt, and others on the\r\nsubject. On Apr. 24th Tulley the younger was endeavouring to adjust\r\nthe object-glass. On May 31st I plainly asked the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland whether he would defray the expense of the mounting and\r\nbuilding. On June 4th he assented, and money was placed at a banker's\r\nto my order. I then proceeded in earnest: in the autumn the building\r\nwas erected, and the dome was covered before the depth of winter. I\r\ncontinued in 1836 to superintend the mounting of the instrument.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the Planetary Reductions: to July 11th J. Glaisher had\r\nbeen employed 27 weeks, and from July 11th to Jan. 16th, 1836, 25\r\nweeks. Mr Spring Rice, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, had promised\r\nmoney, but no official minute had been made, and no money had been\r\ngranted. On Aug. 21st I applied to Mr Baring (Secretary of the\r\nTreasury). After another letter he answered on Oct. 15th that he\r\nfound no official minute. After writing to Vernon Harcourt and to\r\nSpring Rice, the matter was arranged: my outlay was refunded, and\r\nanother sum granted.--In regard to Groombridge's Observations, I find\r\nthat on Dec. 16th certain trial reductions had been made under my\r\ndirection by J. Glaisher.--I had attempted some optical experiments in\r\nthe summer, especially on the polarization of sky-light; but had been\r\ntoo busy with the Observatory to continue them.\r\n\r\n\"In August my wife was in a critical state of health.--In December I\r\nreceived information regarding merchant ships' chronometers, for which\r\nI had applied to Mr Charles Parker of Liverpool.--On Dec. 8th Mr\r\nSpring Rice and Lord John Russell offered me knighthood, but I\r\ndeclined it.--On July 23rd I went into Suffolk with my wife's sisters\r\nElizabeth and Georgiana, and returned on August 3rd: this was all the\r\nholiday that I got in this year.--On the 14th of August I saw Mr\r\nTaylor, the Admiralty Civil Architect in London, and the extension of\r\nbuildings at Greenwich Observatory was arranged.--I made various\r\njourneys to Greenwich, and on Dec. 17th, having sent off our\r\nfurniture, we all quitted the Cambridge Observatory, and stayed for\r\nsome days at the house of Miss Sheepshanks.\r\n\r\n\"Thus ended a busy and anxious year.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith reference to the offer of knighthood above-mentioned, Airy's\r\nreply is characteristic, and the short correspondence relating to it\r\nis therefore inserted.--The offer itself is an additional proof of the\r\nhigh estimation in which he stood at this time.\r\n\r\n                                                       DOWNING STREET,\r\n                                                    _Dec. 8th 1835_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have been in communication with my colleague Lord John Russell which\r\nhas made me feel rather anxious to have the pleasure of seeing you,\r\nbut on second thoughts it has occurred to me that the subject of my\r\ncommunication would render it more satisfactory to you to receive a\r\nletter than to pay a visit.\r\n\r\nIn testimony of the respect which is felt for your character and\r\nacquirements, there would be every disposition to recommend you to His\r\nMajesty to receive the distinction of Knighthood. I am quite aware\r\nthat to you individually this may be a matter of small concern, but to\r\nthe scientific world in general it will not be indifferent, and to\r\nforeign countries it will mark the consideration felt for you\r\npersonally as well as for the position which you occupy among your\r\nlearned contemporaries.\r\n\r\nFrom a knowledge of the respect and esteem which I feel for you Lord\r\nJohn Russell has wished that the communication should be made through\r\nme rather than through any person who had not the pleasure of your\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nPray let me hear from you and believe me my dear Sir, with compliments\r\nto Mrs Airy,\r\n\r\n        Very truly yours,\r\n          T. SPRING RICE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--It may be right to add that when a title of honor is conferred\r\non grounds like those which apply to your case, no fees or charges of\r\nany kind would be payable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE,\r\n                                                  _1835, Dec. 10th_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 8th, which I have received at\r\nthis place, conveying to me an intimation of the wish of His Majesty's\r\nMinisters to recommend me to the King for the honor of Knighthood.\r\n\r\nI beg to assure you that I am most sensible to the liberality which I\r\nhave experienced from the Government in other as well as in pecuniary\r\nmatters, and that I am very highly gratified by the consideration\r\n(undeserved by me, I fear) which they have displayed in the present\r\ninstance. And if I now request permission to decline the honor offered\r\nto me, I trust I may make it fully understood that it is not because I\r\nvalue it lightly or because I am not anxious to receive honors from\r\nsuch a source.\r\n\r\nThe unalterable custom of this country has attached a certain degree\r\nof light consideration to titles of honor which are not supported by\r\nconsiderable fortune; or at least, it calls for the display of such an\r\nestablishment as may not be conveniently supported by even a\r\ncomfortable income. The provision attached to my official situation,\r\nand the liberality of the King towards one of the members of my\r\nfamily, have placed me in a position of great comfort. These\r\ncircumstances however have bound me to consider myself as the devoted\r\nservant of the country, and to debar myself from efforts to increase\r\nmy fortune which might otherwise have been open to me. I do not look\r\nforward therefore to any material increase of income, and that which I\r\nenjoy at present is hardly sufficient, in my opinion, to support\r\nrespectably the honor which you and Lord John Russell have proposed to\r\nconfer upon me. For this reason only I beg leave most respectfully to\r\ndecline the honor of Knighthood at the present time.\r\n\r\nI have only to add that my services will always be at the command of\r\nthe Government in any scientific subject in which I can be of the\r\nsmallest use.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Your very faithful Servant,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_The Right Honorable T. Spring Rice_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"In brief revision of the years from 1827 to 1835 I may confine myself\r\nto the two principal subjects--my Professorial Lectures, and my\r\nConduct of the Cambridge Observatory.\r\n\r\n\"The Lectures as begun in 1827 included ordinary Mechanics, ordinary\r\nHydrostatics and Pneumatics (I think that I did not touch, or touched\r\nvery lightly, on the subjects connected with the Hydraulic Ram), and\r\nordinary Optics (with a very few words on Polarization and\r\nDepolarization). In 1828 the two first were generally improved, and\r\nfor the third (Optics) I introduced a few words on Circular\r\nPolarization. I believe that it was in 1829 that I made an addition\r\nto the Syllabus with a small engraving, shewing the interference of\r\nlight in the best practical experiment (that of the flat prism); and I\r\nwent thoroughly into the main points of the Undulatory Theory,\r\ninterference, diffraction, &c. In 1830 I believe I went (in addition\r\nto what is mentioned above) into Polarization and Depolarization of\r\nall kinds. My best lecture diagrams were drawn and painted by my\r\nwife. The Lectures were universally pronounced to be valuable. The\r\nsubjects underwent no material change in 1831, 2, 3, 4, 5; and I\r\nbelieve it was a matter of sincere regret to many persons that my\r\nremoval to Greenwich terminated the series. Each lecture nominally\r\noccupied an hour. But I always encouraged students to stop and talk\r\nwith me; and this supplement was usually considered a valuable part of\r\nthe lecture. Practically the lecture, on most days, occupied two\r\nhours. I enjoyed the Lectures much: yet I felt that the labour (in\r\naddition to other work) made an impression on my strength, and I\r\nbecame at length desirous of terminating them.\r\n\r\n\"The Observatory, when I took charge of it, had only one\r\ninstrument--the Transit-Instrument The principles however which I laid\r\ndown for my own direction were adapted to the expected complete\r\nequipment, Planets (totally neglected at Greenwich) were to be\r\nobserved. Observations were to be reduced completely, and the\r\nreductions were to be exhibited in an orderly way: this was a novelty\r\nin Astronomy. I considered it so important that I actually proposed\r\nto omit in my publication the original observations, but was dissuaded\r\nby Herschel and others. I sometimes suspended, observations for a\r\nshort time, in order to obtain leisure for; the reductions. I had at\r\nfirst no intention of correcting the places of the fundamental stars\r\nas settled at Greenwich. But I found myself compelled to do so,\r\nbecause they were not sufficiently accurate; and then I took the\r\ncourse of observing and reducing as an independent observer, without\r\nreference to any other observatory. I introduced the principle of not\r\ncorrecting instrumental errors, but measuring them and applying\r\nnumerical corrections. I determined my longitude by chronometers, and\r\nmy latitude by a repeating circle borrowed from Mr Sheepshanks, which\r\nI used so well that the result; was only half a second in error. The\r\nform of my reductions in the published volume for 1828 is rather\r\nirregular, but the matter is good: it soon attracted attention. In\r\n1829 the process was much the same: I had an assistant, Mr Baldrey.\r\nIn 1830 still the same, with the additions:--that I formally gave the\r\ncorrections of relative right-ascension of fundamental stars (without\r\nalteration of equinox, which I had not the means of obtaining) to be\r\nused in the year 1831; and that I reduced completely the observed\r\noccultations (with a small error, subsequently corrected). In 1831 the\r\nsystem of correction of broken transits was improved: the errors of\r\nassumed R.A. of Fundamental Stars were exhibited: Mean Solar Time was\r\nobtained from Sidereal Time by time of Transit of [Symbol: Aries]\r\n(computed by myself): the method of computing occultations was\r\nimproved. In 1832 the small Equatoreal was erected, and was soon\r\nemployed in observations of the elongation of the 4th Satellite of\r\nJupiter for determining the mass of Jupiter. The Mural Circle was\r\nerected at the end of the year, but not used. The calculation of\r\nR.A. of Fundamental Stars was made homogeneously with the others:\r\nseparate results of all were included in ledgers: a star-catalogue was\r\nformed: all as to the present time (1871). With the Equatoreal the\r\ndifference of N.P.D. of Mars and stars was observed.\r\n\r\n\"With the beginning of 1833 the Mural Circle was established at work,\r\na second assistant (Mr Glaisher) was appointed, and the Observatory\r\nmight be considered complete. I made experiments on the graduations of\r\nthe Circle. I detected and was annoyed by the R--D. I determined the\r\nlatitude. I exhibited the separate results for N.P.D. of stars in\r\nledger, and their means in Catalogue. I investigated from my\r\nobservations the place of equinox and the obliquity of the ecliptic.\r\nI made another series of observations of Jupiter's 4th Satellite, for\r\nthe mass of Jupiter. I observed the solar eclipse with the Equatoreal,\r\nby a method then first introduced, which I have since used several\r\ntimes at Cambridge and Greenwich with excellent effect. The Moon and\r\nthe Planets were usually observed till near two in the morning.\r\nCorrection for defective illumination applied when necessary.\r\nThe volume is very complete, the only deficiency being in\r\nthe observation of Moon and Planets through the severe morning\r\nhours. In 1834 the only novelties are--examination of the graduations\r\nof the declination circle of the Equatoreal (excessively bad):\r\nobservations of a spot on Jupiter for rotation, and of Mars and\r\nstars. In 1835 (including January 1836) there is a more complete\r\nexamination of the Equatoreal graduations: parallax and refraction for\r\nEquatoreal observations: a spot on Jupiter: a series of observations\r\non Jupiter's 4th Satellite for the mass of Jupiter: Mars and stars:\r\nHalley's Comet (the best series of observations which could be made in\r\nthe season): and a short series of meteorological observations, on a\r\nplan suggested by Sir John Herschel then at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell precisely in which year I introduced the following\r\nuseful custom. Towards the end of each year I procured a pocket-book\r\nfor the following year with a space for every day, and carefully\r\nexamining all the sources of elements of observations, and determining\r\nthe observations to be made every day, I inserted them in the\r\npocket-book. This system gave wonderful steadiness to the plan of\r\nobservations for the next year. The system has been maintained in\r\ngreat perfection at the Observatory of Greenwich. (The first of these\r\npocket-books which Prof. Adams has found is that for 1833.) Printed\r\nskeleton forms were introduced for all calculations from 1828. In the\r\nGreenwich Observatory Library there is a collection, I believe\r\ncomplete, of printed papers commencing with my manifesto, and\r\ncontaining all Syndicate Reports except for 1833 (when perhaps there\r\nwas none). It seems from these that my first written Report on\r\nObservations, &c., was on May 30th, 1834. The first Syndicate Report\r\nis on May 25th, 1829.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few remarks on Airy's private life and friends during his residence\r\nat Cambridge Observatory may be here appropriately inserted.\r\n\r\nAmid the laborious occupations recorded in the foregoing pages, his\r\nsocial life and surroundings appear to have been most pleasant and\r\ncongenial. At that period there were in residence in Cambridge, and\r\nparticularly at Trinity, a large number of very brilliant men. Airy\r\nwas essentially a Cambridge man. He had come up poor and friendless:\r\nhe had gained friends and fame at the University, and his whole work\r\nhad been done there. From the frequent references in after times both\r\nby him and his wife to their life at Cambridge, it is clear that they\r\nhad a very pleasant recollection of it, and that the social gatherings\r\nthere were remarkably attractive. He has himself recorded that with\r\nWhewell and Sedgwick, and his accomplished sisters-in-law, who were\r\nfrequently on long visits at the Observatory, they formed pretty\r\nnearly one family.\r\n\r\nHis friendship with Whewell was very close. Although Whewell was at\r\ntimes hasty, and rough-mannered, and even extremely rude, yet he was\r\ngenerous and large-minded, and thoroughly upright. [Footnote: The\r\nfollowing passage occurs in a letter from Airy to his wife, dated\r\n1845, Sept. 17th: \"I am sorry that ---- speaks in such terms of the\r\n'Grand Master,' as she used to be so proud of him: it is only those\r\nwho have _well_ gone through the ordeal of quarrels with him and\r\nalmost insults from him, like Sheepshanks and me, that thoroughly\r\nappreciate the good that is in him: I am sure he will never want a\r\ngood word from me.\"]  In power of mind, in pursuits, and interests,\r\nAiry had more in common with Whewell than with any other of his\r\nfriends. It was with Whewell that he undertook the experiments at\r\nDolcoath: it was to Whewell that he first communicated the result of\r\nhis remarkable investigation of the Long Inequality of Venus and the\r\nEarth; and some of his Optical researches were conducted jointly with\r\nWhewell. Whewell took his degree in 1816, seven years before Airy, and\r\nhis reputation, both for mathematical and all-round knowledge, was\r\nextremely and deservedly great, but he was always most generous in his\r\nrecognition of Airy's powers. Thus in a letter of Mar. 16th, 1823\r\n(Life of William Whewell by Mrs Stair Douglas), he says, \"Airy is\r\ncertainly a most extraordinary man, and deserves everything that can\r\nbe said of him\"; and again in the autumn of 1826 he writes to his\r\naunt, \"You mentioned a difficulty which had occurred to you in one of\r\nyour late letters; how Airy should be made Professor while I was here,\r\nwho, being your nephew, must of course, on that account, deserve it\r\nbetter than he could. Now it is a thing which you will think odd, but\r\nit is nevertheless true, that Airy is a better mathematician than your\r\nnephew, and has moreover been much more employed of late in such\r\nstudies.... Seriously speaking, Airy is by very much the best person\r\nthey could have chosen for the situation, and few things have given me\r\nso much pleasure as his election.\" How much Whewell depended upon his\r\nfriends at the Observatory may be gathered from a letter which he\r\nwrote to his sister on Dec. 21st, 1833. \"We have lately been in alarm\r\nhere on the subject of illness. Two very near friends of mine,\r\nProf. and Mrs Airy, have had the scarlet fever at the same time; she\r\nmore slightly, he very severely. They are now, I am thankful to say,\r\ndoing well and recovering rapidly. You will recollect that I was\r\nstaying with them at her father's in Derbyshire in the summer. They\r\nare, I think, two of the most admirable and delightful persons that\r\nthe world contains.\" And again on Dec. 20th, 1835, he wrote to his\r\nsister Ann, \"My friends--I may almost say my dearest friends\r\n--Professor Airy and his family have left Cambridge, he being\r\nappointed Astronomer Royal at Greenwich--to me an irreparable loss;\r\nbut I shall probably go and see how they look in their new abode.\"\r\nTheir close intercourse was naturally interrupted by Airy's removal to\r\nGreenwich, but their friendly feelings and mutual respect continued\r\nwithout material break till Whewell's death. There was frequent\r\ncorrespondence between them, especially on matters connected with the\r\nconduct and teaching of the University, in which they both took a keen\r\ninterest, and a warm welcome at Trinity Lodge always awaited Mr and\r\nMrs Airy when they visited Cambridge. In a letter written to Mrs Stair\r\nDouglas on Feb. 11th, 1882, enclosing some of Whewell's letters, there\r\noccurs the following passage: \"After the decease of Mrs Whewell,\r\nWhewell wrote to my wife a mournful letter, telling her of his\r\nmelancholy state, and asking her to visit him at the Lodge for a few\r\ndays. And she did go, and did the honours of the house for several\r\ndays. You will gather from this the relation in which the families\r\nstood.\" Whewell died on Mar. 6th, 1866, from the effects of a fall\r\nfrom his horse, and the following extract is from a letter written by\r\nAiry to Whewell's niece, Mrs Sumner Gibson, on hearing of the death of\r\nhis old friend:\r\n\r\n\"The Master was, I believe, my oldest surviving friend (beyond my own\r\nfamily), and, after an acquaintance of 46 years, I must have been one\r\nof his oldest friends. We have during that time been connected\r\nprivately and officially: we travelled together and experimented\r\ntogether: and as opportunity served (but I need not say in very\r\ndifferent degrees) we both laboured for our College and University. A\r\nterrible blank is left on my mind.\"\r\n\r\nSedgwick was probably 15 years older than Airy: he took his degree in\r\n1808. But the astonishing buoyancy of spirits and bonhomie of Sedgwick\r\nfitted him for all ages alike. He was undoubtedly the most popular man\r\nin Cambridge in modern times. His ability, his brightness and wit, his\r\nfearless honesty and uprightness, his plain-speaking and good humour,\r\nrendered him a universal favourite. His close alliance with Airy was\r\nmuch more social than scientific. It is true that they made some\r\ngeological excursions together, but, at any rate with Airy, it was far\r\nmore by way of recreation than of serious study, and Sedgwick's\r\nscience was entirely geological. Their friendship continued till\r\nSedgwick's death, though it was once or twice imperilled by Sedgwick's\r\nimpulsive and hasty nature.\r\n\r\nPeacock took his degree in 1813 (Herschel's year), and was therefore\r\nprobably 10 years older than Airy. He was the earliest and staunchest\r\nfriend of Airy in his undergraduate years, encouraged him in every\r\npossible way, lent him books, assisted him in his studies, helped him\r\nwith wise advice on many occasions, and took the greatest interest in\r\nhis success. He was a good and advanced mathematician, and with a\r\ngreat deal of shrewdness and common-sense he united a singular\r\nkindness and gentleness of manner. It is therefore not to be wondered\r\nat that he was regarded by Airy with the greatest esteem and\r\naffection, and though they were afterwards separated, by Peacock\r\nbecoming Dean of Ely and Airy Astronomer Royal, yet their warm\r\nfriendship was never broken. The following letter, written by Airy to\r\nMrs Peacock on receiving the news of the death of the Dean, well\r\nexpresses his feelings towards his old friend:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             TRINITY LODGE, CAMBRIDGE,\r\n                                                     _1858, Dec. 4_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\nI have desired for some time to express to you my sympathies on\r\noccasion of the sad bereavement which has come upon me perhaps as\r\nstrongly as upon any one not connected by family ties with my late\r\nfriend. But I can scarcely give you an idea how every disposable\r\nmoment of my time has been occupied. I am now called to Cambridge on\r\nbusiness, and I seize the first free time to write to you.\r\n\r\nMy late friend was the first person whom I knew in College (I had an\r\nintroduction to him when I went up as freshman). From the first, he\r\ndesired me to consider the introduction not as entitling me to a mere\r\nformal recognition from him, but as authorizing me at all times to\r\ncall on him for any assistance which I might require. And this was\r\nfully carried out: I referred to him in every difficulty: I had the\r\nentire command of his rooms and library (a very important aid in\r\nfollowing the new course of mathematics which he had been so\r\ninstrumental in introducing into the University) in his occasional\r\nabsences: and in all respects I looked to him as to a parent. All my\r\ndebts to other friends in the University added together are not\r\ncomparable to what I owe to the late Dean.\r\n\r\nLatterly I need not say that I owed much to him and that I owe much to\r\nyou for your kind notice of my two sons, even since the sad event\r\nwhich has put it out of his power to do more.\r\n\r\nIn the past summer, looking to my custom of making a visit to\r\nCambridge in some part of the October Term, I had determined that a\r\nvisit to Ely this year should not depend on the chance of being free\r\nto leave Cambridge, but that, if it should be found convenient to\r\nyourself and the Dean, the first journey should be made to Ely. I\r\nwish that I had formed the same resolution one or two years ago.\r\n\r\nWith many thanks for your kindness, and with deep sympathy on this\r\noccasion,\r\n\r\n        I am,\r\n      My dear Madam,\r\n        Yours very faithfully,\r\n          G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\nSheepshanks was a Fellow of Trinity, in orders: he was probably seven\r\nyears older than Airy (he took his degree in 1816). He was not one of\r\nAiry's earliest friends, but he had a great taste and liking for\r\nastronomy, and the friendship between them when once established\r\nbecame very close. He was a very staunch and fearless friend, an able\r\nand incisive writer, and remarkably energetic and diligent in\r\nastronomical investigations. He, or his sister, Miss Sheepshanks, had\r\na house in London, and Sheepshanks was very much in London, and busied\r\nhimself extremely with the work of the Royal Observatory, that of the\r\nBoard of Longitude, and miscellaneous astronomical matters. He was\r\nmost hospitable to his friends, and while Airy resided at Cambridge\r\nhis house was always open to receive him on his frequent visits to\r\ntown. In the various polemical discussions on scientific matters in\r\nwhich Airy was engaged, Sheepshanks was an invaluable ally, and after\r\nAiry's removal to Greenwich had more or less separated him from his\r\nCambridge friends, Sheepshanks was still associated with him and took\r\na keen interest in his Greenwich work. And this continued till\r\nSheepshanks's death. The warmest friendship always subsisted between\r\nthe family at the Observatory and Mr and Miss Sheepshanks.\r\n\r\nThere were many other friends, able and talented men, but these four\r\nwere the chief, and it is curious to note that they were all much\r\nolder than Airy. It would seem as if Airy's knowledge had matured in\r\nso remarkable a manner, and the original work that he produced was so\r\nbrilliant and copious, that by common consent he ranked with men who\r\nwere much his seniors: and the natural gravity and decorum of his\r\nmanners when quite a young man well supported the idea of an age\r\nconsiderably greater than was actually the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n               AT GREENWICH OBSERVATORY--1836 TO 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1836\r\n\r\n\"Through the last quarter of 1835 I had kept everything going on at\r\nthe Greenwich Observatory in the same manner in which Mr Pond had\r\ncarried it on. With the beginning of 1836 my new system began. I had\r\nalready prepared 30 printed skeleton forms (a system totally unknown\r\nto Mr Pond) which were now brought into use. And, having seen the\r\nutility of the Copying Press in merchants' offices, I procured\r\none. From this time my correspondence, public and private, is\r\nexceedingly perfect.\r\n\r\n\"At this time the dwelling house was still unconnected with the\r\nObservatory. It had no staircase to the Octagon Room. Four new rooms\r\nhad been built for me on the western side of the dwelling house, but\r\nthey were not yet habitable. The North-east Dome ground floor was\r\nstill a passage room. The North Terrace was the official passage to\r\nthe North-west Dome, where there was a miserable Equatoreal, and to\r\nthe 25-foot Zenith Tube (in a square tower like a steeple, which\r\nconnected the N.W. Dome with Flamsteed's house). The southern boundary\r\nof the garden ran down a hollow which divides the peninsula from the\r\nsite of the present Magnetic Observatory, in such a manner that the\r\nprincipal part of the garden was fully exposed to the public. The\r\nComputing Room was a most pitiful little room. There was so little\r\nroom for me that I transported the principal table to a room in my\r\nhouse, where I conducted much of my own official business. A large\r\nuseless reflecting telescope (Ramage's), on the plan and nearly of the\r\nsize of Sir W. Herschel's principal telescope, encumbered the centre\r\nof the Front Court.\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 11th I addressed Mr Buck, agent of the Princess Sophia of\r\nGloucester, Ranger of Greenwich Park, for leave to enclose a portion\r\nof the ground overlooking my garden. This was soon granted, and I was\r\npartially delivered from the inconvenience of the public gaze. The\r\nliberation was not complete till the Magnetic ground was enclosed in\r\n1837.\r\n\r\n\"In the inferior departments of the Admiralty, especially in the\r\nHydrographic Office (then represented by Captain Beaufort) with which\r\nI was principally connected, the Observatory was considered rather as\r\na place for managing Government chronometers than as a place of\r\nscience. The preceding First Assistant (Taylor) had kept a book of\r\nletter references, and I found that out of 840 letters, 820 related to\r\nGovernment chronometers only. On Jan. 17th I mentally sketched my\r\nregulations for my own share in chronometer business. I had some\r\ncorrespondence with Captain Beaufort, but we could not agree, and the\r\nmatter was referred to the Admiralty. Finally arrangements were made\r\nwhich put the chronometer business in proper subordination to the\r\nscientific charge of the Observatory.\r\n\r\n\"In my first negociations with the Admiralty referring to acceptance\r\nof the office of Astronomer Royal, in 1834, Lord Auckland being then\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, I had stipulated that, as my successor at\r\nCambridge would be unprepared to carry on my Lectures, I should have\r\npermission to give a final course of Lectures there. At the end of\r\n1835 Lord Auckland was succeeded by Lord Minto: I claimed the\r\npermission from him and he refused it. When this was known in\r\nCambridge a petition was presented by many Cambridge residents, and\r\nLord Minto yielded. On April 18th I went to Cambridge with my wife,\r\nresiding at the Bull Inn, and began Lectures on April 21st: they\r\ncontinued (apparently) to May 27th. My lecture-room was crowded (the\r\nnumber of names was 110) and the lectures gave great satisfaction. I\r\noffered to the Admiralty to put all the profits in their hands, and\r\ntransmitted a cheque to the Accountant General of the Navy: but the\r\nAdmiralty declined to receive them.\r\n\r\n\"On June 4th the Annual Visitation of the Observatory was held, Mr\r\nF. Baily in the Chair. I presented a written Report on the Observatory\r\n(a custom which I had introduced at Cambridge) in which I did not\r\nsuppress the expression of my feelings about chronometer business. The\r\nHydrographer, Captain Beaufort, who was one of the Official Visitors,\r\nwas irritated: and by his influence the Report was not printed. I\r\nkept it and succeeding Reports safe for three years, and then the\r\nBoard of Visitors agreed to print them; and four Reports were printed\r\ntogether, and bound with the Greenwich Observations of 1838.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of this year I completed the volume of Observations\r\nmade at Cambridge Observatory in 1835 and on Nov. 10th the printed\r\ncopies were distributed. About the end of 1835 the Dome for the\r\nNorthumberland Telescope was erected: but apparently the polar frame\r\nwas not erected.\"\r\n\r\nThe following account of an accident which occurred during the\r\nconstruction of the dome is extracted from a letter by Airy to his\r\nwife dated 1836 Jan. 31st. \"The workmen's account of the dome blowing\r\noff is very curious: it must have been a strange gust. It started\r\nsuddenly when the men were all inside and Beaumont was looking up at\r\nit: the cannon balls were thrown in with great violence (one of them\r\ngoing between the spokes of Ransomes' large casting), and instantly\r\nafter the dome had started, the boards of the outside scaffolding\r\nwhich had been tossed up by the same gust dropped down into the gap\r\nwhich the dome had left. It is a wonder that none of the men were hurt\r\nand that the iron was not broken. The dome is quite covered and I\r\nthink does not look so well as when the hooping was visible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Previous to 1836 I had begun to contemplate the attachment of\r\nMagnetic Observations to the Observatory, and had corresponded with\r\nProf. Christie, Prof. Lloyd, Prof. J. D. Forbes, and Mr Gauss on the\r\nsubject. On Jan. 12th 1836 I addressed a formal letter to the\r\nAdmiralty, and on Jan. 18th received their answer that they had\r\nreferred it to the Board of Visitors. On March 25th I received\r\nauthority for the expenditure of _£30_, and I believe that I then\r\nordered Merz's 2-foot magnet. The Visitors met on Feb. 26th and after\r\nsome discussion the site was chosen and the extent of ground generally\r\ndefined, and on Dec. 22nd Mr Spring Rice (Lord Monteagle) as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer virtually effected the transfer of the\r\nground. But no further steps were taken in 1836. A letter on a\r\nsystematic course of magnetic observations in various parts of the\r\nworld was addressed by Baron Alexander Humboldt to the Duke of Sussex,\r\nPresident of the Royal Society; and was referred to Prof. Christie and\r\nme. We reported on it on June 9th 1836, strongly recommending the\r\nadoption of the scheme.\r\n\r\n\"A plan had been proposed by the Promoters of the London and Gravesend\r\nRailway (Col. Landman, Engineer) for carrying a railway at high level\r\nacross the bottom of the Park. On Jan. 9th I received orders from the\r\nAdmiralty to examine into its possible effect in producing vibrations\r\nin the Observatory. After much correspondence, examination of ground,\r\n&c., I fixed upon a part of the Greenwich Railway (not yet opened for\r\ntraffic) near the place where the Croydon trunk line now joins it, as\r\nthe place for trains to run upon, while I made observations with a\r\ntelescope viewing a collimator by reflection in mercury at the\r\ndistance of 500 feet. The experiments were made on Jan. 25th, and I\r\nreported on Feb. 4th. It was shewn that there would be some danger to\r\nthe Observatory. On Nov. 2nd Mr James Walker, Engineer, brought a\r\nmodel of a railway to pass by tunnel under the lower part of the Park:\r\napparently this scheme was not pressed.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the routine work of the Observatory, a special set of\r\nobservations were made to determine the mass of Jupiter.--Also the\r\nSolar Eclipse of May 15th was observed at Greenwich in the manner\r\nwhich I had introduced at Cambridge.--The Ordnance Zenith Sector, and\r\nthe instruments for the St Helena Observatory were brought for\r\nexamination.--Much attention was given to chronometers, and various\r\nsteps were taken for their improvement.--I had some important\r\ncorrespondence with Mr (Sir John) Lubbock, upon the Lunar Theory\r\ngenerally and his proposed empirical lunar tables. This was the first\r\ngerm of the great reduction of Lunar Observations which I subsequently\r\ncarried out.--In October I was nominated on the Council of the Royal\r\nSociety, having been admitted a Fellow on Feb. 18th 1836. I was\r\nPresident of the Astronomical Society during this and the preceding\r\nyear (1836 and 1835).\r\n\r\n\"My connection with Groombridge's Catalogue of Stars began in 1832,\r\nand the examination, in concert with Mr Baily, of the edition printed\r\nby Mr Henry Taylor, resulted in its condemnation. In 1834 I\r\nvolunteered to the Admiralty to prepare a new edition, and received\r\ntheir thanks and their authority for proceeding. It required a great\r\ndeal of examination of details, and much time was spent on it in 1836:\r\nbut it was not brought to the state of readiness for press.\r\n\r\n\"My predecessor, Mr Pond, died on Sept. 7th 1836, and was interred in\r\nHalley's tomb in Lee churchyard.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written by Airy in support of the application\r\nfor a pension to Mrs Pond, who had been left in great distress:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       To HENRY WARBURTON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\"The points upon which in my opinion Mr Pond's claims to the gratitude\r\nof Astronomers are founded, are principally the following. _First_\r\nand chief, the accuracy which he introduced into all the principal\r\nobservations. This is a thing which from its nature it is extremely\r\ndifficult to estimate now, so long after the change has been made, and\r\nI can only say that so far as I can ascertain from books the change is\r\none of very great extent: for certainty and accuracy, Astronomy is\r\nquite a different thing from what it was, and this is mainly due to Mr\r\nPond. The most striking exemplification of this is in his laborious\r\nworking out of every conceivable cause or indication of error in the\r\nCircle and the two Circles: but very great praise is also due for the\r\nnew system which he introduced in working the Transit. In comparing Mr\r\nPond's systems of observation with Dr Maskelyne's, no one can avoid\r\nbeing impressed with the inferiority of Dr Maskelyne's. It is very\r\nimportant to notice that the continental observatories which have\r\nsince attracted so much attention did not at that time exist or did\r\nnot exist in vigour. _Secondly_, the attention bestowed by Mr Pond on\r\nthose points (chiefly of sidereal astronomy) which he regarded as\r\nfundamental: to which such masses of observations were directed as\r\nentirely to remove the doubts from probable error of individual\r\nobservations or chance circumstances which have injured many other\r\ndeterminations. _Thirdly_, the regularity of observation. The effect\r\nof all these has been that, since the commencement of Mr Pond's\r\nresidence at Greenwich, Astronomy considered as an accurate\r\nrepresentation of the state of the heavens in the most material points\r\nhas acquired a certainty and an extent which it never had\r\nbefore. There is no period in the history of the science so clean. On\r\nsome matters (in regard to the choice of observations) I might say\r\nthat my own judgment would have differed in some degree from Mr\r\nPond's, but one thing could have been gained only by giving up\r\nanother, and upon the general accuracy no improvement could have been\r\nmade. Mr Pond understood nothing of physical astronomy; but neither\r\ndid anybody else, in England.\r\n\r\n\"The supposed decrease of general efficiency in the last few years is\r\nto be ascribed to the following causes:\r\n\r\n1. Mr Pond's ill health.\r\n\r\n2. The inefficiency of his first assistant.\r\n\r\n3. The oppression of business connected with chronometers.\r\n\r\n\"The last of these, as I have reason to think, operated very far.\r\nBusiness of this nature which (necessarily) is _daily_ and\r\n_peremptory_ will always prevail over that which is _general_ and\r\n_confidential_. I will not trouble you with an account of the various\r\nways in which the chronometer business teazed the Astronomer Royal\r\n(several alterations having been made at my representation), but shall\r\nmerely remark that much of the business had no connection whatever\r\nwith astronomy.\r\n\r\n\"I beg to submit these remarks to your perusal, requesting you to\r\npoint out to me _what part_ of them should be laid before any of the\r\nKing's Ministers, _at what time, in what shape_, and to whom\r\naddressed. I am quite sure that Mrs Pond's claims require nothing to\r\nensure favourable consideration but the impression of such a feeling\r\nof Mr Pond's astronomical merits as must be entertained by any\r\nreasonable astronomer; and I am most anxious to assist in conveying\r\nthis impression.\r\n\r\n\"Of private history: I went to Suffolk for a week on Mar. 25th. On\r\nSept. 19th my son Wilfrid (my fourth child) was born. In October I\r\nmade an excursion for a week round the coast of Kent. In November I\r\nwent to my brother's house at Keysoe in Bedfordshire: I was much\r\nexposed to cold on the return-journey, which probably aggravated the\r\nillness that soon followed. From Nov. 27th I was ill; made the last\r\njournal entry of the year on Dec. 6th; the next was on Jan. 14th,\r\n1837. I find that in this year I had introduced Arthur Biddell to the\r\nTithe Commutation Office, where he was soon favourably received, and\r\nfrom which connection he obtained very profitable employment as a\r\nvaluer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1837\r\n\r\n\"My connection with Cambridge Observatory was not yet finished. I had\r\ndetermined that I would not leave a figure to be computed by my\r\nsuccessor. In October I had (at my private expense) set Mr Glaisher to\r\nwork on reducing the observations of Sun, Moon, and Planets made in\r\n1833, 1834, 1835; and subsequently had the calculations examined by Mr\r\nHartnup. This employed me at times through 1837. I state here, once\r\nfor all, that every calculation or other work in reference to the\r\nCambridge Observatory, in this and subsequent years, was done at my\r\nprivate expense. The work of the Northumberland Telescope was going on\r\nthrough the year: from Nov. 24th to 29th I was at Cambridge on these\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\"An object-glass of 6-3/4 inches aperture (a most unusual size at this\r\ntime, when it was difficult to find a 4-inch or 5-inch glass) had been\r\npresented to the Greenwich Observatory by my friend Mr Sheepshanks,\r\nand on Mar. 29th I received from the Admiralty authority for mounting\r\nit equatoreally in the empty South Dome, which had been intended for a\r\ncopy of the Palermo Circle.--In the month of July the Admiralty wished\r\nfor my political assistance in a Greenwich election, but I refused to\r\ngive any.--On Jan. 3rd I gave notice to the Admiralty that I had\r\nfinished the computations of Groombridge's Catalogue, and was ready to\r\nprint. The printing was authorized and proceeded (the introduction was\r\nfinished on Nov. 22nd), but the book was not quite ready till the\r\nbeginning of 1838.--In connection with the Cavendish experiment: on\r\nJune 10th I wrote to Spring Rice (Chancellor of the Exchequer) for\r\n_£500_, which was soon granted: and from this time there is a great\r\ndeal of correspondence (mainly with Mr Baily) upon the details of the\r\nexperiment and the theory of the calculation.--On July 24th I saw the\r\ndescent of the parachute by which Mr Cocking was killed. I attended\r\nthe coroner's inquest and gave evidence a few days later.\r\n\r\n\"The Planetary Reductions from 1750 to 1830 had been going on: the\r\ncomputers (Glaisher, Hartnup, and Thomas) worked in the Octagon Room,\r\nand considerable advance was made.--In consequence of the agitation of\r\nthe proposal by Mr Lubbock to form empirical tables of the Moon, for\r\nwhich I proposed to substitute complete reduction of the observations\r\nof the Moon from 1750, the British Association at York (Oct. 23rd,\r\n1837) appointed a deputation (including myself) to place the matter\r\nbefore the Government. I wrote on the matter to Mr Wood (Lord Halifax)\r\nstating that it would be proper to raise the First Assistant's salary,\r\nand to give me more indefinite power about employing computers. In all\r\nthese things I received cordial assistance from Mr Wood. The\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer (Mr Spring Rice) received us on Dec. 20th:\r\nstatements were furnished by me, and the business was sanctioned\r\nimmediately.--During this year I was very much engaged in\r\ncorrespondence with Lubbock and others on improvements of the Lunar\r\nTheory.\r\n\r\n\"In the operations of 1836 and 1837 a great quantity of papers had\r\nbeen accumulated. I had kept them in reasonably good order, tied up in\r\nbundles: but this method began to fail in convenience, as the number\r\nincreased. The great lines of classification were however now well\r\nunderstood. I believe it was in the latter part of the year 1837 that\r\nI finally settled on the principle of arranging papers in packets and\r\nsubordinate packets, every paper being flat, by the use of four\r\npunched holes in every paper. I have never seen any principle of\r\narrangement comparable to this. It has been adopted with the greatest\r\nease by every assistant, and is used to the present time (1871)\r\nwithout alteration.\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 3rd I was informed unofficially by Mr Wood (Admiralty\r\nSecretary) that the addition of the Magnetic Ground was sanctioned. On\r\nFeb. 16th Mr Rhodes (an officer of the Department of Woods and Works)\r\ncame to put me formally in possession of the ground. Between Apr. 26th\r\nand May 13th the ground was enclosed, and my garden was completely\r\nprotected from the public. The plan of the building was settled, and\r\nnumerous experiments were made on various kinds of concrete: at last\r\nit was decided to build with wood.\r\n\r\n\"After a dinner given by Lord Burlington, Chancellor, the first\r\nmeeting of the London University was held on Mar. 4th, and others\r\nfollowed. On Apr. 18th I handed to the Chancellor a written protest\r\nagainst a vote of a salary of _£1000_ to the Registrar: which salary,\r\nin fact, the Government refused to sanction. Dissensions on the\r\nquestion of religious examination were already beginning, but I took\r\nlittle part in them.\r\n\r\n\"In 1833 Mr Henderson had resigned the superintendance of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope Observatory, and Mr Maclear was appointed. I recommended the\r\nsame Official Instructions for him (they had included an allusion to\r\nLa Caille's Arc of Meridian) with an addition on the probability of\r\nTrigonometrical Survey, on Aug. 8th, 1837. On Feb. 24th, 1837, I wrote\r\nto Beaufort suggesting that Bradley's Sector should be used for\r\nverifying the astronomical determinations, and subsequently received\r\nthe approval of the Admiralty. In June Sir J. Herschel and I had an\r\ninterview with Mr Wood on the Cape equipment generally. The Sector was\r\nerected with its new mounting, careful drawings were made of every\r\npart, instructions were prepared for its use, and on Aug. 10th it was\r\nsent to Woolwich Dockyard and shipped for the Cape.\r\n\r\n\"Of private history: On Aug. 23rd I started with my wife for an\r\nexcursion in South Wales, &c. On Sept. 9th I gave a lecture in the\r\nTown Hall of Neath. While at Swansea we received news of the death of\r\nmy wife's father, the Rev. Richard Smith, and returned at once.--In\r\nthis year Arthur Biddell bought the little Eye estate for me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1838\r\n\r\n\"Cambridge Observatory:--On Dec. 29th, 1837, I had set Mr Glaisher to\r\nwork in collecting the annual results for star-places from the\r\nCambridge Observations, to form one catalogue: I examined the\r\ncalculations and the deduced catalogue, and on Dec. 14, 1838,\r\npresented it to the Royal Astronomical Society, under the title of\r\n'The First Cambridge Catalogue.'--For the Northumberland telescope I\r\nwas engaged with Simms about the clockwork from time to time up to\r\nApr. 30th, and went to Cambridge about it. The instrument was brought\r\nto a useable state, but some small parts were still wanting.\r\n\r\n\"At Greenwich:--In April I drew up a little history of the Observatory\r\nfor the Penny Cyclopaedia.--On June 30th the Lords of the Admiralty\r\npaid a short visit to the Observatory: on this occasion Mr Wood\r\nsuggested a passage connecting the Observatory with the\r\ndwelling-house, and I subsequently prepared sketches for it; it was\r\nmade in the next year.--In the course of the year the Sheepshanks\r\nEquatoreal was mounted, and Encke's Comet was observed with it from\r\nOct. 26th to Nov. 13th.--On Mar. 31st, &c. I reported to the Admiralty\r\non the selection of chronometers for purchase, from a long list: this\r\nwas an important beginning of a new system.--The Magnetic Observatory\r\nwas built, in the form originally planned for it (a four-armed cross\r\nwith equal arms, one axis being in the magnetic meridian) in the\r\nbeginning of this year. (No alteration has since been made in form up\r\nto the present time, 1871, except that the north arm has been\r\nlengthened 8 feet a few years ago.) On May 21st a magnet was suspended\r\nfor the first time, Mr Baily and Lieut. (afterwards Sir William)\r\nDenison being present.--Groombridge's Catalogue was finished, and on\r\nMar. 3rd I arranged for sending out copies.--The Planetary Reductions\r\nwere carried on vigorously. On May 31st, 1838, the Treasury assented\r\nto the undertaking of the Lunar Reductions and allotted _£2,000_ for\r\nit: preparations were made, and in the autumn 7 computers were\r\nemployed upon it. It will easily be seen that this undertaking added\r\nmuch to my labours and cares.--The geodetic affairs of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope began to be actively pressed, and in February Beaufort wrote\r\nto me in consequence of an application from Maclear, asking about a\r\nstandard of length for Maclear (as foundation for a geodetic\r\nsurvey). I made enquiries, and on Mar. 13th wrote to Mr Wood, alluding\r\nalso generally to the want of a National English standard after the\r\ndestruction of the Houses of Parliament. On Apr. 24th the Admiralty\r\nsanctioned my procuring proper Standard Bars.--In connection with the\r\nCavendish Experiment, I have an immense quantity of correspondence\r\nwith Mr Baily, and all the mathematics were furnished by me: the\r\nexperiment was not finished at the end of the year.--The Perturbations\r\nof Uranus were now attracting attention. I had had some correspondence\r\non this subject with Dr Hussey in 1834, and in 1837 with Eugène\r\nBouvard. On Feb. 24th, of 1838, I wrote to Schumacher regarding the\r\nerror in the tabular radius-vector of Uranus, which my mode of\r\nreducing the observations enabled me to see.\r\n\r\n\"The National Standards of Length and Weight had been destroyed in the\r\nfire of the Houses of Parliament. On May 11th I received a letter from\r\nMr Spring Rice, requesting me to act (as chairman) with a committee\r\nconsisting of F. Baily, J.E. Drinkwater Bethune, Davies Gilbert,\r\nJ.G.S. Lefevre, J.W. Lubbock, G. Peacock, and R. Sheepshanks, to\r\nreport on the steps now to be taken. I accepted the charge, and the\r\nfirst meeting was held at the Observatory on May 22nd; all subsequent\r\nmeetings in London, usually in the apartments of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society. I acted both as chairman and as working\r\nsecretary. Our enquiries went into a very wide field, and I had much\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\"On Jan. 4th Mr Wood wrote to me, mentioning that Capt. Johnson had\r\nmade some observations on the magnetism of iron ships, and asking\r\nwhether they ought to be continued; a steamer being offered at _£50_\r\nper week. I applied to Beaufort for a copy of Johnson's Observations,\r\nand on Jan. 7th replied very fully, discouraging such observations;\r\nbut recommending a train of observations expressly directed to\r\ntheoretical points. On Feb. 17th I reported that I had examined the\r\nDeptford Basin, and found that it would do fairly well for\r\nexperiments. On July 14th, 1838, Capt. Beaufort wrote to me that the\r\nAdmiralty wished for experiments on the ship, the 'Rainbow,' then in\r\nthe river, and enquired whether I would undertake them and what\r\nassistance I desired, as for instance that of Christie or Barlow. I\r\nreplied that one person should undertake it, either Christie, Barlow,\r\nor myself, and that a basin was desirable. On July 16th and 17th I\r\nlooked at the basins of Woolwich and Deptford, approving the\r\nlatter. On July 21st the Admiralty gave me full powers. From July 23rd\r\nI was almost entirely employed on preparations. The course of\r\noperations is described in my printed Paper: the original maps,\r\ncurves, and graphical projections, are in the bound MSS.: 'Correction\r\nof Compass in Iron Ships--\"Rainbow,\"' at the Greenwich\r\nObservatory. The angular disturbances were found on July 26th and\r\n30th, requiring some further work on a raft, so that they were finally\r\nworked out on Aug. 11th. I struggled hard with the numbers, but should\r\nnot have succeeded if it had not occurred to me to examine the\r\nhorizontal magnetic intensities. This was done on Aug. 14th, and the\r\nexplanation of the whole was suggested at once: graphical projections\r\nwere made on Aug. 16th and 17th for comparison of my explanation with\r\nobservations, and the business was complete. On Aug. 17th and 18th I\r\nmeasured the intensity of some magnets, to be used in the ship for\r\ncorrection. It is to be remarked that, besides the effect of polar\r\nmagnetism, there was no doubt of the existence of an effect of induced\r\nmagnetism requiring correction by other induced magnetism: and\r\nexperiments for this were made in the Magnetic Observatory. All was\r\nready for trial: and on Aug. 20th I carried my magnets and iron\r\ncorrectors to Deptford, mounted them in the proper places, tried the\r\nship, and the compass, which had been disturbed 50 degrees to the\r\nright and 50 degrees to the left, was now sensibly correct. On\r\nAug. 21st I reported this to the Admiralty, and on Aug. 24th I tried\r\nthe ship to Gravesend. On Aug. 30th I had the loan of her for an\r\nexpedition with a party of friends to Sheerness, and on Sept. 9th I\r\naccompanied her to Gravesend, on her first voyage to Antwerp.--On\r\nOct. 5th application was made to me by the owner of the 'Ironsides' to\r\ncorrect her compasses. In consequence of this I went to Liverpool on\r\nOct. 25th, and on this occasion made a very important improvement in\r\nthe practical mode of performing the correction.--On Nov. 16th I\r\nreported to the Admiralty in considerable detail. On Dec. 4th I had an\r\ninterview with Lord Minto (First Lord of the Admiralty) and Mr\r\nWood. They refused to sanction any reward to me.--The following is a\r\ncopy of the report of the Captain of the 'Rainbow' after her voyage to\r\nAntwerp: 'Having had the command of the Rainbow steamer the two\r\nvoyages between London and Antwerp, I have the pleasure to inform you\r\nthat I am perfectly satisfied as to the correctness of the compasses,\r\nand feel quite certain they will continue so. I took particular notice\r\nfrom land to land from our departure and found the bearings by compass\r\nto be exact.'\"--The following extracts from letters to his wife refer\r\nto the \"Ironsides\": on Oct. 28th 1838 he writes, \"I worked up the\r\nobservations so much as to see that the compass disturbance is not so\r\ngreat as in the 'Rainbow' (35° instead of 50°), but quite enough to\r\nmake the vessel worthless; and that it is quite different in direction\r\nfrom that in the 'Rainbow'--so that if they had stolen one of the\r\n'Rainbow' correctors and put it into this ship it would have been much\r\nworse than before.\" And on Nov. 1st he writes, \"On Wednesday I again\r\nwent to the ship and tried small alterations in the correctors: I am\r\nconfident now that the thing is very near, but we were most abominably\r\nbaffled by the sluggishness of the compass.\"\r\n\r\n\"The University of London:--On Jan. 6th I attended a sub-committee\r\nmeeting on the minimum of acquirements for B.A. degree, and various\r\nmeetings of the Senate. On July 14th I intimated to Mr Spring Rice my\r\nwish to resign. I had various correspondence, especially with Mr\r\nLubbock, and on Dec. 13th I wrote to him on the necessity of stipends\r\nto Members of Senate. The dissensions on religious examination became\r\nvery strong. I took a middle course, demanding examination in the\r\nlanguages and books, but absolutely refusing to claim any religious\r\nassent. I expressed this to Dr Jerrard, the principal representative\r\non the religious side, by calling on him to substitute the words\r\n'Recognition of Christian Literature' for 'Recognition of Christian\r\nReligion': I addressed a printed letter to Lord Burlington\r\n(Chancellor) and the Members of the Senate, on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Of private history: In January I made a short excursion in Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk, and visited Prof. Sedgwick at Norwich. In April I paid a\r\nshort visit to Mr Courtney at Sanderstead, with my wife. On June 14th\r\nmy son Hubert was born. In September I went with my sister by\r\nCambridge, &c., to Luddington, where I made much enquiry concerning my\r\nfather and the family of Airy who had long been settled there. We then\r\nvisited various places in Yorkshire, and arrived at Brampton, near\r\nChesterfield, where Mrs Smith, my wife's mother, now resided. And\r\nreturned by Rugby. I had much correspondence with my brother and for\r\nhim about private pupils and a better church living. I complained to\r\nthe Bishop of Norwich about the mutilation of a celebrated monument in\r\nPlayford Church by the incumbent and curate.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from letters to his wife relating to the\r\nabove-mentioned journeys:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       CLOSE, NORWICH.\r\n                                                    _1838, Jan. 21_.\r\n\r\nI do not know what degree of cold you may have had last night, but\r\nhere it was (I believe) colder than before--thermometer close to the\r\nhouse at 3°. I have not suffered at all. However I do not intend to go\r\nto Lowestoft.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             BRAMPTON.\r\n                                                 _1838, Sept. 30th_.\r\n\r\nWe began to think that we had seen enough of Scarborough, so we took a\r\nchaise in the afternoon to Pickering, a small agricultural town, and\r\nlodged in a comfortable inn there. On Wednesday morning at 8 we\r\nstarted by the railroad for Whitby, in a huge carriage denominated the\r\nLady Hilda capable of containing 40 persons or more drawn by one\r\nhorse, or in the steep parts of the railway by two horses. The road\r\ngoes through a set of defiles of the eastern moorlands of Yorkshire\r\nwhich are extremely pretty: at first woody and rich, then gradually\r\npoorer, and at last opening on a black moor with higher moors in\r\nsight: descending in one part by a long crooked inclined plane, the\r\ncarriage drawing up another load by its weight: through a little\r\ntunnel: and then along a valley to Whitby. The rate of travelling was\r\nabout 10 miles an hour. Betsy declares that it was the most agreeable\r\ntravelling that she ever had.\r\n\r\nYesterday (Saturday) Caroline drove Betsy and Miss Barnes drove me to\r\nClay Cross to see the works at the great railroad tunnel there. Coming\r\nfrom the north, the railroad passes up the Chesterfield valley close\r\nby the town and continues up the same valley, till it is necessary for\r\nit to enter the valley which runs the opposite way towards Buttersley:\r\nthe tunnel passes under the high ground between these two vallies: so\r\nthat it is in reality at the water-shed: it is to be I think more than\r\na mile long, and when finished 27 feet clear in height, so it is a\r\ngrand place. We saw the preparations for a blast, and heard it fired:\r\nthe ladies stopping their ears in due form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1839\r\n\r\n\"Cambridge Observatory:--On Mar. 7th I went to Cambridge on the\r\nbusiness of the Northumberland Telescope: I was subsequently engaged\r\non the accounts, and on Aug. 16th I finally resigned it to\r\nProf. Challis, who accepted it on Aug. 19th. On Sept. 11th I\r\ncommunicated its completion and the settlement of accounts to the Duke\r\nof Northumberland. The total expense was _£1938. 9s. 2d._ + 15000\r\nfrancs for the object-glass.\r\n\r\n\"At Greenwich Observatory:--On Jan. 3rd I received the last revise of\r\nthe 1837 Observations, and on Jan. 8th the first sheet for 1838.--In\r\nJuly I report on selection from a long list of chronometers which had\r\nbeen on trial, and on Sept. 2nd I pointed out to Capt. Beaufort that\r\nthe system of offering only one price would be ruinous to the\r\nmanufacture of chronometers, and to the character of those supplied to\r\nthe Admiralty: and that I would undertake any trouble of classifying\r\nthe chronometers tried. This letter introduced the system still in use\r\n(1871), which has been most beneficial to the manufacture. On\r\nSept. 11th I proposed that all trials begin in the first week of\r\nJanuary: this also has been in use as an established system to the\r\npresent time.--It was pointed out to me that a certain chronometer was\r\naffected by external magnetic power. I remedied this by placing under\r\nit a free compass magnet: a stand was specially prepared for it. I\r\nhave never found another chronometer sensibly affected by\r\nmagnetism.--In November and December I tried my new double-image\r\nmicrometer.--Between May 16th and Oct. 13th a fireproof room was\r\nconstructed in the southern part of the quadrant room; and in November\r\na small shed was erected over the entrance to the North Terrace.--The\r\nposition of the free Meridional Magnet (now mounted in the Magnetic\r\nObservatory) was observed at every 5 m. through 24 hours on Feb. 22nd\r\nand 23rd, May 24th and 25th, Aug. 30th and 31st, and Nov. 29th and\r\n30th. This was done in cooperation with the system of the Magnetic\r\nUnion established by Gauss in Germany.--The Reduction of the Greenwich\r\nPlanetary and Lunar Observations, 1750 to 1830, went on steadily. I\r\nhad six and sometimes seven computers constantly at work, in the\r\nOctagon Room.--As in 1838 I had a great amount of correspondence with\r\nMr Baily on the Cavendish Experiment.--I attended as regularly as I\r\ncould to the business of the University of London. The religious\r\nquestion did not rise very prominently. I took a very active part, and\r\nhave a great deal of correspondence, on the nature of the intended\r\nexaminations in Hydrography and Civil Engineering.--On the Standards\r\nCommission the chief work was in external enquiries.--On June 6th I\r\nhad enquiries from John Quincey Adams (U.S.A.) on the expense, &c., of\r\nobservatories: an observatory was contemplated in America.--I had\r\ncorrespondence about the proposed establishment of observatories at\r\nDurham, Glasgow, and Liverpool.\r\n\r\n\"I had in this year a great deal of troublesome and on the whole\r\nunpleasant correspondence with the Admiralty about the correction of\r\nthe compass in iron ships. I naturally expected some acknowledgment of\r\nan important service rendered to Navigation: but the Admiralty\r\nperemptorily refused it. My account of the Experiments &c. for the\r\nRoyal Society is dated April 9th. The general success of the\r\nundertaking soon became notorious, and (as I understood) led\r\nimmediately to extensive building of iron ships: and it led also to\r\napplications to me for correction of compasses. On Jan. 9th I was\r\naddressed in reference to the Royal Sovereign and Royal George at\r\nLiverpool; July 18th the Orwell; May 11th two Russian ships built on\r\nthe Thames; Sept. 4th the ships of the Lancaster Company.\r\n\r\n\"I had much work in connection with the Cape of Good Hope Observatory,\r\nchiefly relating to the instrumental equipment and to the geodetical\r\nwork. As it was considered advisable that any base measured in the\r\nCape Colony should be measured with compensation bars, I applied to\r\nMajor Jervis for the loan of those belonging to the East Indian\r\nSurvey, but he positively refused to lend them. On Jan. 20th I applied\r\nto Col. Colby for the compensation bars of the British Survey, and he\r\nimmediately assented to lending them. Col. Colby had suggested to the\r\nOrdnance Department that Capt. Henderson and several sappers should be\r\nsent to use the measuring bars, and it was so arranged. It still\r\nappeared desirable to have the command of some soldiers from the\r\nGarrison of Cape Town, and this matter was soon arranged with the\r\nmilitary authorities by the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\"The following are the principal points of my private history: it was\r\na very sad year. On Jan. 24th I went with my wife to Norwich, on a\r\nvisit to Prof. Sedgwick, and in June I visited Sir J. Herschel at\r\nSlough. On June 13th my dear boy Arthur was taken ill: his malady soon\r\nproved to be scarlet fever, of which he died on June 24th at 7 in the\r\nmorning. It was arranged that he should be buried in Playford\r\nchurchyard on the 28th, and on that day I proceeded to Playford with\r\nmy wife and my eldest son George Richard. At Chelmsford my son was\r\nattacked with slight sickness, and being a little unwell did not\r\nattend his brother's funeral. On July 1st at 4h.15m. in the morning he\r\nalso died: he had some time before suffered severely from an attack of\r\nmeasles, and it seemed probable that his brain had suffered. On July\r\n5th he was buried by the side of his brother Arthur in Playford\r\nchurchyard.--On July 23rd I went to Colchester on my way to\r\nWalton-on-the-Naze, with my wife and all my family; all my children\r\nhad been touched, though very lightly, with the scarlet fever.--It was\r\nnear the end of this year that my mother quitted the house (Luck's) at\r\nPlayford, and came to live with me at Greenwich Observatory, where she\r\nlived till her death; having her own attendant, and living in perfect\r\nconfidence with my wife and myself, and being I trust as happy as her\r\nyears and widowhood permitted. My sister also lived with me at the\r\nObservatory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1840\r\n\r\n\"In the latter part of 1839, and through 1840, I had much\r\ncorrespondence with the Admiralty, in which I obtained a complete\r\naccount of the transfer of the Observatory from the Ordnance\r\nDepartment to the Admiralty, and the transfer of the Visitation of the\r\nObservatory from the Royal Society to the present Board of\r\nVisitors. In 1840 I found that the papers of the Board of Longitude\r\nwere divided between the Royal Society and the Admiralty: I obtained\r\nthe consent of both to bring them to the Observatory.\r\n\r\n\"In this year I began to arrange about an annual dinner to be held at\r\nthe Visitation.--My double-image micrometer was much used for\r\nobservations of circumpolar double stars.--In Magnetism and\r\nMeteorology, certain quarterly observations were kept up; but in\r\nNovember the system of incessant eye-observations was commenced. I\r\nrefused to commence this until I had secured a 'Watchman's Clock' for\r\nmechanical verification of the regular attendance of the\r\nAssistants.--With regard to chronometers: In this year, for the first\r\ntime, I took the very important step of publishing the rates obtained\r\nby comparisons at the Observatory. I confined myself on this occasion\r\nto the chronometers purchased by the Admiralty. In March a\r\npigeon-house was made for exposure of chronometers to cold.--The Lunar\r\nand Planetary Reductions were going on steadily.--I was consulted\r\nabout an Observatory at Oxford, where I supported the introduction of\r\nthe Heliometer.--The stipend of the Bakerian Lecture was paid to me\r\nfor my explanation of Brewster's new prismatic fringes.--The business\r\nof the Cape Observatory and Survey occupied much of my time.--In 1838\r\nthe Rev. H. J. Rose (Editor of the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana) had\r\nproposed my writing a Paper on Tides, &c.; In Oct. 1840 I gave him\r\nnotice that I must connect Tides with Waves, and in that way I will\r\ntake up the subject. Much correspondence on Tides, &c., with Whewell\r\nand others followed.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the Magnetical and Meteorological Establishment. On\r\nJune 18th Mr Lubbock reported from the Committee of Physics of the\r\nRoyal Society to the Council in favour of a Magnetic and\r\nMeteorological Observatory near London. After correspondence with\r\nSheepshanks, Lord Northampton, and Herschel, I wrote to the Council on\r\nJuly 9th, pointing out what the Admiralty had done at Greenwich, and\r\noffering to cooperate. In a letter to Lord Minto I stated that my\r\nestimate was _£550_, including _£100_ to the First Assistant:\r\nLubbock's was _£3,000_. On Aug. 11th the Treasury assented, limiting\r\nit to the duration of Ross's voyage. On Aug. 17th Wheatstone looked at\r\nour buildings and was satisfied. My estimate was sent to the\r\nAdmiralty, viz. _£150_ outfit, _£520_ annual expense; and Glaisher to\r\nbe Superintendent. I believe this was allowed for the present; for\r\nthe following year it was placed on the Estimates. Most of the\r\ncontemplated observations were begun before the end of 1840: as much\r\nas possible in conformity with the Royal Society's plan. Mr Hind\r\n(subsequently the Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac) and Mr Paul\r\nwere the first extra assistants.\r\n\r\n\"Of private history. On Feb. 29th I went to Cambridge with my Paper on\r\nthe Going Fusee. On Mar. 27th I went to visit Mrs Smith, my wife's\r\nmother, at Brampton near Chesterfield. I made a short visit to\r\nPlayford in April and a short expedition to Winchester, Portsmouth,\r\n&c., in June. From Sept. 5th to Oct. 3rd I was travelling in the\r\nNorth of England and South of Scotland.\" [This was an extremely active\r\nand interesting journey, in the course of which a great number of\r\nplaces were visited by Airy, especially places on the Border mentioned\r\nin Scott's Poems, which always had a great attraction for him. He also\r\nattended a Meeting of the British Association at Glasgow and made a\r\nstatement regarding the Planetary and Lunar Reductions: and looked at\r\na site for the Glasgow Observatory.] \"In November I went for a short\r\ntime to Cambridge and to Keysoe (my brother's residence). On\r\nDec. 26th my daughter Hilda was born (subsequently married to\r\nE.J. Routh). In this year I had a loss of _£350_ by a fire on my Eye\r\nestate.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from letters to his wife. Some of them\r\nrelate to matters of general interest. They are all of them\r\ncharacteristic, and serve to shew the keen interest which he took in\r\nmatters around him, and especially in architecture and scenery. The\r\nfirst letter relates to his journey from Chesterfield on the previous\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      FLAMSTEED HOUSE,\r\n                                                    _1840, April 2_.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to put up with an outside place to Derby yesterday, much\r\nagainst my will, for I was apprehensive that the cold would bring on\r\nthe pain in my face. Of that I had not much; but I have caught\r\nsomething of sore throat and catarrh. The coach came up at about 22\r\nminutes past 8. It arrived in Derby at 20 minutes or less past 11\r\n(same guard and coachman who brought us), and drew up in the street\r\nopposite the inn at which we got no dinner, abreast of an omnibus. I\r\nhad to go to a coach office opposite the inn to pay and be booked for\r\nLondon, and was duly set down in a way-bill with _name_; and then\r\nentered the omnibus: was transferred to the Railway Station, and then\r\nreceived the Railway Ticket by shouting out my name. If you should\r\ncome the same way, you would find it convenient to book your place at\r\nChesterfield to London by your name (paying for the whole, namely,\r\ncoach fare, omnibus fare _-/6_, and railway fare _£1. 15s. 0d._ first\r\nclass). Then you will only have to step out of the coach into the\r\nomnibus, and to scream out once or twice to the guard to make sure\r\nthat you are entered in the way-bill and that your luggage is put on\r\nthe omnibus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                           FLAMSTEED HOUSE, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                   _1840, April 15_.\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell you that at Lord Northampton's I saw some specimens\r\nof the Daguerrotype, pictures made by the Camera Obscura, and they\r\nsurpass in beauty of execution anything that I could have\r\nimagined. Baily who has two or three has promised to lend them for\r\nyour inspection when you return. Also I saw some post-office stamps\r\nand stamped envelopes: I do not much admire the latter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following relates to the fire on his Eye farm, referred to above:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             PLAYFORD,\r\n                                                   _1840, April 23_.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday (yesterday) went with my uncle to the Eye Estate, to see\r\nthe effects of the fire. The farming buildings of every kind are as\r\ncompletely cleared away as if they had been mown down: not a bit of\r\nanything but one or two short brick walls and the brick foundations of\r\nthe barns and stacks. The aspect of the place is much changed, because\r\nin approaching the house you do not see it upon a back-ground of\r\nbarns, &c., but standing alone. The house is in particularly neat and\r\ngood order. I did not think it at all worth while to make troublesome\r\nenquiries of the people who reside there, but took Mr Case's\r\naccount. There seems no doubt that the fire was caused by the\r\nmaid-servant throwing cinders into a sort of muck-place into which\r\nthey had been commonly thrown. I suppose there was after all this dry\r\nweather straw or muck drier than usual, and the cinders were hotter\r\nthan usual. The whole was on fire in an exceedingly short time; and\r\neverything was down in less than an hour. Two engines came from Eye,\r\nand all the population of the town (as the fire began shortly after\r\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon). It is entirely owing to these that my\r\nhouse, and the farm (Sewell's) on the opposite side of the road, were\r\nnot burned down. At the beginning of the fire the wind was N.E. which\r\nblew directly towards the opposite farm (Sewell's): although the\r\nnearest part of it (tiled dwelling house) was 100 yards off or near\r\nit, and the great barn (thatched roof) considerably further, yet both\r\nwere set on fire several times. All this while, the tail of my house\r\nwas growing very hot: and shortly after the buildings fell in burning\r\nruins, the wind changed to N.W., blowing directly to my house. If this\r\nchange had happened while the buildings were standing and burning,\r\nthere would have been no possibility of saving the house. As it was,\r\nthe solder is melted from the window next the farm-yard, and the roof\r\nwas set on fire in three or four places. One engine was kept working\r\non my house and one on the opposite farm. A large pond was pretty\r\nnearly emptied. Mr Case's horses and bullocks were got out, not\r\nwithout great difficulty, as the progress of the fire was fearfully\r\nrapid. A sow and nine pigs were burnt, and a large hog ran out burnt\r\nso much that the people killed it immediately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                               GEORGE INN, WINCHESTER,\r\n                                                    _1840, June 21_.\r\n\r\nAt Winchester we established ourselves at the George and then without\r\ndelay proceeded to St Cross. I did not know before the nature of its\r\nhospital establishment, but I find that it is a veritable set of\r\nalms-houses. The church is a most curious specimen of the latest\r\nNorman. I never saw one so well marked before--Norman ornaments on\r\npointed arches, pilasters detached with cushion capitals, and various\r\nsigns: and it is clearly an instance of that state of the style when\r\npeople had been forced by the difficulties and inelegancies of the\r\nround arch in groining to adopt pointed arches for groining but had\r\nnot learnt to use them for windows.......This morning after breakfast\r\nwent to the Cathedral (looking by the way at a curious old cross in\r\nthe street). I thought that its inside was wholly Norman, and was most\r\nagreeably surprised by finding the whole inside groined in every part\r\nwith excellent late decorated or perpendicular work. Yet there are\r\nseveral signs about it which lead me to think that the whole inside\r\nhas been Norman, and even that the pilasters now worked up into the\r\nperpendicular are Norman. The transepts are most massive old Norman,\r\nwith side-aisles running round their ends (which I never saw\r\nbefore). The groining of the side aisles of the nave very effective\r\nfrom the strength of the cross ribs. The clerestory windows of the\r\nquire very large. The organ is on one side. But the best thing about\r\nthe quire is the wooden stall-work, of early decorated, very\r\nbeautiful. A superb Lady Chapel, of early English.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                           PORTSMOUTH,\r\n                                                    _1840, June 23_.\r\n\r\nWe left Winchester by evening train to the Dolphin, Southampton, and\r\nslept there. At nine in the morning we went by steamboat down the\r\nriver to Ryde in the Isle of Wight: our steamer was going on to\r\nPortsmouth, but we thought it better to land at Ryde and take a boat\r\nfor ourselves. We then sailed out (rather a blowing day) to the vessel\r\nattending Col. Pasley's operations, and after a good deal of going\r\nfrom one boat to another (the sea being so rough that our boat could\r\nnot be got up to the ships) and a good deal of waiting, we got on\r\nboard the barge or lump in which Col. Pasley was. Here we had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the barrel of gunpowder lowered (there was more\r\nthan a ton of gunpowder), and seeing the divers go down to fix it,\r\ndressed in their diving helmets and supplied with air from the great\r\nair-pump above. When all was ready and the divers had ascended again,\r\nthe barge in which we were was warped away, and by a galvanic battery\r\nin another barge (which we had seen carried there, and whose\r\nconnection with the barrel we had seen), upon signal given by sound of\r\ntrumpet, the gunpowder was fired. The effect was most wonderful. The\r\nfiring followed the signal instantaneously. We were at between 100 and\r\n200 yards from the place (as I judge), and the effects were as\r\nfollows. As soon as the signal was given, there was a report, louder\r\nthan a musket but not so loud as a small cannon, and a severe shock\r\nwas felt at our feet, just as if our barge had struck on a\r\nrock. Almost immediately, a very slight swell was perceived over the\r\nplace of the explosion, and the water looked rather foamy: then in\r\nabout a second it began to rise, and there was the most enormous\r\noutbreak of spray that you can conceive. It rose in one column of 60\r\nor 70 feet high, and broad at the base, resembling a stumpy sheaf with\r\njagged masses of spray spreading out at the sides, and seemed to grow\r\noutwards till I almost feared that it was coming to us. It sunk, I\r\nsuppose, in separate parts, for it did not make any grand squash down,\r\nand then there were seen logs of wood rising, and a dense mass of\r\nblack mud, which spread gradually round till it occupied a very large\r\nspace. Fish were stunned by it: our boatmen picked up some. It was\r\nsaid by all present that this was the best explosion which had been\r\nseen: it was truly wonderful. Then we sailed to Portsmouth.......The\r\nexplosion was a thing worth going many miles to see. There were many\r\nyachts and sailing boats out to see it (I counted 26 before they were\r\nat the fullest), so that the scene was very gay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere are some notes on York Cathedral after the fire:\r\n\r\n                                               RED LION HOTEL, REDCAR,\r\n                                                    _1840, Sept. 7_.\r\n\r\nMy first letter was closed after service at York Cathedral. As soon as\r\nI had posted it, I walked sedately twice round the cathedral, and then\r\nI found the sexton at the door, who commiserating me of my former vain\r\napplications, and having the hope of lucre before his eyes, let me\r\nin. I saw the burnt part, which looks not melancholy but\r\nunfinished. Every bit of wood is carried away clean, with scarcely a\r\nsmoke-daub to mark where it has been: the building looks as if the\r\nwalls were just prepared for a roof, but there are some deep dints in\r\nthe pavement, shewing where large masses have fallen. The lower parts\r\nof some of the columns (to the height of 8 or 10 feet) are much scaled\r\nand cracked. The windows are scarcely touched. I also refreshed my\r\nmemory of the chapter-house, which is most beautiful, and which has\r\nmuch of its old gilding reasonably bright, and some of its old paint\r\nquite conspicuous. And I looked again at the old crypt with its late\r\nNorman work, and at the still older crypt of the pre-existing church.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1841\r\n\r\n\"The routine work of the Observatory in its several departments was\r\ncarried on steadily during this year.--The Camera Obscura was removed\r\nfrom the N.W. Turret of the Great Room, to make way for the\r\nAnemometer.--In Magnetism and Meteorology the most important thing was\r\nthe great magnetic storm of Sept. 29th, which revealed a new class of\r\nmagnetic phenomena. It was very well observed by Mr Glaisher, and I\r\nimmediately printed and circulated an account of it.--In April I\r\nreported that the Planetary Reductions were completed, and furnished\r\nestimates for the printing.--In August I applied for 18,000 copies of\r\nthe great skeleton form for computing Lunar Tabular Places, which were\r\ngranted.--I reported, as usual, on various Papers for the Royal\r\nSociety, and was still engaged on the Cavendish Experiment.--In the\r\nUniversity of London I attended the meeting of Dec. 8th, on the\r\nreduction of Examiners' salaries, which were extravagant.--I furnished\r\nCol. Colby with a plan of a new Sector, still used in the British\r\nSurvey.--I appealed to Colby about the injury to the cistern on the\r\nGreat Gable in Cumberland, by the pile raised for the Survey\r\nSignal.--On Jan. 3rd occurred a most remarkable tidal disturbance: the\r\ntide in the Thames was 5 feet too low. I endeavoured to trace it on\r\nthe coasts, and had a vast amount of correspondence: but it elicited\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\"Of private history: I was a short time in Suffolk in March.--On\r\nMar. 31st I started with my wife (whose health had suffered much) for\r\na trip to Bath, Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, &c. While at Swansea we\r\nreceived news on Apr. 24th of the deadly illness of my dear mother. We\r\ntravelled by Neath and Cardiff to Bath, where I solicited a rest for\r\nmy wife from my kind friend Miss Sutcliffe, and returned alone to\r\nGreenwich. My dear mother had died on the morning of the 24th. The\r\nfuneral took place at Little Whelnetham (near Bury) on May 1st, where\r\nmy mother was buried by the side of my father. We went to Cambridge,\r\nwhere my wife consulted Dr Haviland to her great advantage, and\r\nreturned to Greenwich on May 7th.--On May 14th to 16th I was at\r\nSanderstead (Rev. J. Courtney) with Whewell as one sponsor, at the\r\nchristening of my daughter Hilda.--In September I went for a trip with\r\nmy sister to Yorkshire and Cumberland, in the course of which we\r\nvisited Dent (Sedgwick's birthplace), and paid visits to Mr\r\nWordsworth, Miss Southey, and Miss Bristow, returning to Greenwich on\r\nthe 30th Sept.--From June 15th to 19th I visited my brother at\r\nKeysoe.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from letters written to his wife while on\r\nthe above trip in Yorkshire and Cumberland:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 RED LION INN, REDCAR,\r\n                                                   _1841, Sept. 11_.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at York: went to the Tavern Hotel. In the morning (Friday)\r\nwent into the Cathedral. I think that it improves on acquaintance. The\r\nnave is now almost filled with scaffolding for the repair of the roof,\r\nso that it has not the bare unfinished appearance that it had when I\r\nwas there last year. The tower in which the fire began seems to be a\r\ngood deal repaired: there are new mullions in its windows, &c. We\r\nstopped to hear part of the service, which was not very effective.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere are notes of his visit to Dentdale in Yorkshire, the birthplace\r\nof his friend Sedgwick:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  KING'S HEAD, KENDAL,\r\n                                                   _1841, Sept. 15_.\r\n\r\nThe day was quite fine, and the hills quite clear. The ascent out of\r\nHawes is dull; the little branch dale is simple and monotonous, and so\r\nare the hills about the great dale which are in sight. The only thing\r\nwhich interested us was the sort of bird's-eye view of Hardraw dell,\r\nwhich appeared a most petty and insignificant opening in the great\r\nhill side. But when we got to the top of the pass there was a\r\nmagnificent view of Ingleborough. The dale which was most nearly in\r\nfront of us is that which goes down to Ingleton, past the side of\r\nIngleborough. The mountain was about nine miles distant. We turned to\r\nthe right and immediately descended Dent-dale. The three dales (to\r\nHawes, to Ingleton, and to Dent) lay their heads together in a most\r\namicable way, so that, when at the top, it is equally easy to descend\r\ndown either of them. We found very soon that Dent-dale is much more\r\nbeautiful than that by which we had ascended. The sides of the hills\r\nare steeper, and perhaps higher: the bottom is richer. The road is\r\nalso better. The river is a continued succession of very pretty falls,\r\nalmost all of which have scooped out the lower strata of the rock, so\r\nthat the water shoots clear over. For several miles (perhaps 10) it\r\nruns upon bare limestone without a particle of earth. From the head of\r\nthe dale to the village of Dent is eight miles. At about half-way is a\r\nnew chapel, very neat, with a transept at its west end. The village of\r\nDent is one of the strangest places that I ever saw. Narrow street, up\r\nand down, with no possibility of two carriages bigger than children's\r\ncarts passing each other. We stopped at the head inn and enquired\r\nabout the Geolog: but he is not in the country. We then called on his\r\nbrother, who was much surprised and pleased to see us. His wife came\r\nin soon after (his daughter having gone with a party to see some\r\nwaterfall) and they urged us to stop and dine with them. So we walked\r\nabout and saw every place about the house, church, and school,\r\nconnected with the history of the Geolog: and then dined. I promised\r\nthat you should call there some time when we are in the north together\r\nand spend a day or two with them. Mr Sedgwick says it is reported that\r\nWhewell will take Sedbergh living (which is now vacant: Trinity\r\nCollege is patron). Then we had our chaise and went to Sedbergh. The\r\nvery mouth of Dent-dale is more contracted than its higher\r\nparts. Sedbergh is embosomed among lumping hills. Then we had another\r\ncarriage to drive to Kendal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a recollection of Wordsworth:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                SALUTATION, AMBLESIDE,\r\n                                                   _1841, Sept. 19_.\r\n\r\nWe then got our dinner at Lowwood, and walked straight to Ambleside,\r\nchanged our shoes, and walked on to Rydal to catch Wordsworth at\r\ntea. Miss Wordsworth was being drawn about in a chair just as she was\r\nseven years ago. I do not recollect her appearance then so as to say\r\nwhether she is much altered, but I think not. Mr Wordsworth is as\r\nfull of good talk as ever, and seems quite strong and well. Mrs\r\nWordsworth looks older. Their son William was at tea, but he had come\r\nover only for the day or evening. There was also a little girl, who I\r\nthink is Mrs Wordsworth's niece.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1842\r\n\r\n\"In this year I commenced a troublesome work, the Description of the\r\nNorthumberland Telescope. On Sept. 9th I wrote to the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland suggesting this, sending him a list of Plates, and\r\nsubmitting an estimate of expense _£120_. On Sept. 19th I received the\r\nDuke's assent. I applied to Prof. Challis (at the Cambridge\r\nObservatory) requesting him to receive the draughtsman, Sly, in his\r\nhouse, which he kindly consented to do.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to Estimates. I now began to point out to the Admiralty\r\nthe inconvenience of furnishing separate estimates, viz. to the\r\nAdmiralty for the Astronomical Establishment, and to the Treasury for\r\nthe Magnetical and Meteorological Establishment.--The great work of\r\nthe Lunar Reductions proceeded steadily: 14 computers were employed on\r\nthem.--With regard to the Magnetical and Meteorological Establishment:\r\nI suppose that James Ross's expedition had returned: and with this,\r\naccording to the terms of the original grant, the Magnetical and\r\nMeteorological Establishments expired. There was much correspondence\r\nwith the Royal Society and the Treasury, and ultimately Sir R. Peel\r\nconsented to the continuation of the establishments to the end of\r\n1845.--In this year began my correspondence with Mr Mitchell about the\r\nCincinnati Observatory. On Aug. 25 Mr Mitchell settled himself at\r\nGreenwich, and worked for a long time in the Computing Room.--And in\r\nthis year Mr Aiken of Liverpool first wrote to me about the Liverpool\r\nObservatory, and a great deal of correspondence followed: the plans\r\nwere in fact entirely entrusted to me.--July 7th was the day of the\r\nTotal Eclipse of the Sun, which I observed with my wife at the\r\nSuperga, near Turin. I wrote an account of my observations for the\r\nRoyal Astronomical Society.--On Jan. 10th I notified to Mr Goulburn\r\nthat our Report on the Restoration of the Standards was ready, and on\r\nJan. 12th I presented it. After this followed a great deal of\r\ncorrespondence, principally concerning the collection of authenticated\r\ncopies of the Old Standards from all sides.--In some discussions with\r\nCapt. Shirreff, then Captain Superintendent of the Chatham Dockyard,\r\nI suggested that machinery might be made which would saw ship-timbers\r\nto their proper form, and I sent him some plans on Nov. 8th. This was\r\nthe beginning of a correspondence which lasted long, but which led to\r\nnothing, as will appear hereafter.--On Dec. 15th, being on a visit to\r\nDean Peacock at Ely, I examined the Drainage Scoop Wheel at\r\nPrickwillow, and made a Report to him by letter, which obtained\r\ncirculation and was well known.--On May 26th the manuscript of my\r\narticle, 'Tides and Waves,' for the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana was\r\nsent to the printer. I had extensive correspondence, principally on\r\nlocal tides, with Whewell and others. Tides were observed for me by\r\nColby's officers at Southampton, by myself at Christchurch and Poole,\r\nat Ipswich by Ransome's man; and a great series of observations of\r\nIrish Tides were made on my plan under Colby's direction in June, July\r\nand August.--On Sept. 15th Mr Goulburn, Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nasked my opinion on the utility of Babbage's calculating machine, and\r\nthe propriety of expending further sums of money on it. I replied,\r\nentering fully into the matter, and giving my opinion that it was\r\nworthless.--I was elected an Honorary Member of the Institution of\r\nCivil Engineers, London.\r\n\r\n\"The reduction and printing of the astronomical observations had been\r\ngetting into arrear: the last revise of the 1840 observations went to\r\npress on May 18th, 1842. On Aug. 18th came into operation a new\r\norganization of Assistants' hours of attendance, &c., required for\r\nbringing up reductions. I worked hard myself and my example had good\r\neffect.\" His reference to this subject in his Report to the Visitors\r\nis as follows: \"I have in one of the preceding articles alluded to the\r\nbackwardness of our reductions. In those which follow it I trust that\r\nI have sufficiently explained it. To say nothing of the loss, from ill\r\nhealth, of the services of most efficient assistants, I am certain\r\nthat the quantity of current work will amply explain any\r\nbackwardness. Perhaps I may particularly mention that in the\r\nobservations of 1840 there was an unusual quantity of equatoreal\r\nobservations, and the reductions attending these occupied a very great\r\ntime. But, as regards myself, there has been another cause. The\r\nreduction of the Ancient Lunar and Planetary Observations, the\r\nattention to chronometer constructions, the proposed management of the\r\nprinting of papers relating to important operations at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope; these and similar operations have taken up much of my\r\ntime. I trust that I am doing well in rendering Greenwich, even more\r\ndistinctly than it has been heretofore, the place of reference to all\r\nthe world for the important observations, and results of observations,\r\non which the system of the universe is founded. As regards myself, I\r\nhave been accustomed, in these matters, to lay aside private\r\nconsiderations; to consider that I am not a mere Superintendent of\r\ncurrent observations, but a Trustee for the honour of Greenwich\r\nObservatory generally, and for its utility generally to the world;\r\nnay, to consider myself not as mere Director of Greenwich Observatory,\r\nbut (however unworthy personally) as British Astronomer, required\r\nsometimes by my office to interfere (when no personal offence is\r\ngiven) in the concerns of other establishments of the State. If the\r\nBoard supports me in this view there can be little doubt that the\r\npresent delay of computations, relating to current observations, will\r\nbe considered by them as a very small sacrifice to the important\r\nadvantage that may be gained by proper attention to the observations\r\nof other times and other places.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of private history: In February I went for a week to Playford and\r\nNorwich, visiting Prof. Sedgwick at the latter place. On Mar. 1st my\r\nthird daughter Christabel was born. In March I paid a short visit to\r\nSir John Herschel at Hawkhurst. From June 12th to Aug. 11th I was\r\ntravelling with my wife on the Continent, being partly occupied with\r\nthe observation of the Total Eclipse of the Sun on July 7th. The\r\njourney was in Switzerland and North Italy. In December I went to\r\nCambridge and Ely, visiting Dr Peacock at the latter place.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Feb. 23rd to 28th Airy was engaged on Observations of Tides at\r\nSouthampton, Christchurch, Poole, and Weymouth. During this expedition\r\nhe wrote frequently (as he always did) to his wife on the incidents of\r\nhis journey, and the following letters appear characteristic:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            KING'S ARMS, CHRISTCHURCH,\r\n                                                    OR XCHURCH,\r\n                                                    _1842, Feb. 24_.\r\n\r\nThe lower of the above descriptions of my present place of abode is\r\nthe correct one, as I fearlessly assert on the authority of divers\r\ndirection-posts on the roads leading to it (by the bye this supports\r\nmy doctrine that x in Latin was not pronounced eks but khi, because\r\nthe latter is the first letter of Christ, for which x is here\r\ntraditionally put). Finding this morning that Yolland (who called on\r\nme as soon as I had closed the letter to you) was perfectly inclined\r\nto go on with the tide observations at Southampton, and that his\r\ncorporals of sappers were conducting them in the most exemplary\r\nmanner, I determined on starting at once. However we first went to\r\nlook at the New Docks (mud up to the knees) and truly it is a very\r\ngreat work. There is to be enclosed a good number of acres of water 22\r\nfeet deep: one dock locked in, the other a tidal dock or basin with\r\nthat depth at low water. They are surrounded by brick walls eight feet\r\nthick at top, 10 or more at bottom; and all the parts that ever can be\r\nexposed are faced with granite. The people reckon that this work when\r\nfinished will attract a good deal of the London commerce, and I should\r\nnot be surprised at it. For it is very much easier for ships to get\r\ninto Southampton than into London, and the railway carriage will make\r\nthem almost one. A very large steamer is lying in Southampton Water:\r\nthe Oriental, which goes to Alexandria. The Lady Mary Wood, a large\r\nsteamer for Lisbon and Gibraltar, was lying at the pier. The said pier\r\nis a very pleasant place of promenade, the water and banks are so\r\npretty, and there is so much liveliness of ships about it. Well I\r\nstarted in a gig, in a swashing rain, which continued off and on for a\r\ngood while. Of the 21 miles, I should think that 15 were across the\r\nNew Forest. I do not much admire it. As for Norman William's\r\ndestruction of houses and churches to make it hunting ground, that is\r\nutter nonsense which never could have been written by anybody that\r\never saw it: but as to hunting, except his horses wore something like\r\nmud-pattens or snow-shoes, it is difficult to conceive it. Almost the\r\nwhole Forest is like a great sponge, water standing in every part. In\r\nthe part nearer to Xchurch forest trees, especially beeches, seem to\r\ngrow well. We stopped to bait at Lyndhurst, a small place high up in\r\nthe Forest: a good view, such as it is, from the churchyard. The\r\nhills of the Isle of Wight occasionally in sight. On approaching\r\nXchurch the chalk cliffs of the west end of the Isle of Wight (leading\r\nto the Needles) were partly visible; and, as the sun was shining on\r\nthem, they fairly blazed. Xchurch is a small place with a\r\nmagnificent-looking church (with lofty clerestory, double transept,\r\n&c., but with much irregularity) which I propose to visit\r\nto-morrow. Also a ruin which looks like an abbey, but the people call\r\nit a castle. There is a good deal of low land about it, and the part\r\nbetween the town and the sea reminded me a good deal of the estuary\r\nabove Cardigan, flat ill-looking bogs (generally islands) among the\r\nwater. I walked to the mouth of the river (more than two miles)\r\npassing a nice little place called Sandford, with a hotel and a lot of\r\nlodgings for summer sea-people. At the entrance of the river is a\r\ncoastguard station, and this I find is the place to which I must go in\r\nthe morning to observe the tide. I had some talk with the coastguard\r\npeople, and they assure me that the tide is really double as\r\nreported. As I came away the great full moon was rising, and I could\r\nread in her unusually broad face (indicating her nearness to the\r\nearth) that there will be a powerful tide. I came in and have had\r\ndinner and tea, and am now going to bed, endeavouring to negociate for\r\na breakfast at six o'clock to-morrow morning. It is raining cats and\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                               LUCE'S HOTEL, WEYMOUTH,\r\n                                                    _1842, Feb. 27_.\r\n\r\nThis morning when I got up I found that it was blowing fresh from\r\nS.W. and the sea was bursting over the wall of the eastern extremity\r\nof the Esplanade very magnanimously. So (the swell not being\r\nfavourable for tide-observations) I gave them up and determined to go\r\nto see the surf on the Chesil Bank. I started with my great-coat on,\r\nmore for defence against the wind than against rain; but in a short\r\ntime it began to rain, and just when I was approaching the bridge\r\nwhich connects the mainland with the point where the Chesil Bank ends\r\nat Portland (there being an arm of the sea behind the Chesil Bank) it\r\nrained and blew most dreadfully. However I kept on and mounted the\r\nbank and descended a little way towards the sea, and there was the\r\nsurf in all its glory. I cannot give you an idea of its majestic\r\nappearance. It was evidently very high, but that was not the most\r\nstriking part of it, for there was no such thing as going within a\r\nconsiderable distance of it (the occasional outbreaks of the water\r\nadvancing so far) so that its magnitude could not be well seen. My\r\nimpression is that the height of the surf was from 10 to 20 feet. But\r\nthe striking part was the clouds of solid spray which formed\r\nimmediately and which completely concealed all the other operations of\r\nthe water. They rose a good deal higher than the top of the surf, so\r\nthe state of things was this. A great swell is seen coming, growing\r\nsteeper and steeper; then it all turns over and you see a face just\r\nlike the pictures of falls of Niagara; but in a little more than one\r\nsecond this is totally lost and there is nothing before you but an\r\nenormous impenetrable cloud of white spray. In about another second\r\nthere comes from the bottom of this cloud the foaming current of water\r\nup the bank, and it returns grating the pebbles together till their\r\njar penetrates the very brain. I stood in the face of the wind and\r\nrain watching this a good while, and should have stood longer but that\r\nI was so miserably wet. It appeared to me that the surf was higher\r\nfarther along the bank, but the air was so thickened by the rain and\r\nthe spray that I could not tell. When I returned the bad weather\r\nabated. I have now borrowed somebody else's trowsers while mine are\r\ndrying (having got little wet in other parts, thanks to my great-coat,\r\nwhich successfully brought home a hundredweight of water), and do not\r\nintend to stir out again except perhaps to post this letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                      FLAMSTEED HOUSE,\r\n                                                     _1842, May 15_.\r\n\r\nYesterday after posting the letter for you I went per steamboat to\r\nHungerford. I then found Mr Vignoles, and we trundled off together,\r\nwith another engineer named Smith, picking up Stratford by the way, to\r\nWormwood Scrubs. There was a party to see the Atmospheric Railway in\r\naction: including (among others) Sir John Burgoyne, whom I met in\r\nIreland several years ago, and Mr Pym, the Engineer of the Dublin and\r\nKingstown Railway, whom I have seen several times, and who is very\r\nsanguine about this construction; and Mr Clegg, the proposer of the\r\nscheme (the man that invented gas in its present arrangements), and\r\nMessrs Samuda, two Jews who are the owners of the experiment now going\r\non; and Sir James South! With the latter hero and mechanician we did\r\nnot come in contact. Unfortunately the stationary engine (for working\r\nthe air-pump which draws the air out of the pipes and thus sucks the\r\ncarriages along) broke down during the experiment, but not till we had\r\nseen the carriage have one right good run. And to be sure it is very\r\nfunny to see a carriage running all alone \"as if the Devil drove it\"\r\nwithout any visible cause whatever. The mechanical arrangements we\r\nwere able to examine as well after the engine had broken down as at\r\nany time. And they are very simple and apparently very satisfactory,\r\nand there is no doubt of the mechanical practicability of the thing\r\neven in places where locomotives can hardly be used: whether it will\r\npay or not is doubtful. I dare say that the Commissioners' Report has\r\ntaken a very good line of discrimination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1843\r\n\r\n\"In March I wrote to Dr Wynter (Vice-Chancellor) at Oxford, requesting\r\npermission to see Bradley's and Bliss's manuscript Observations, with\r\nthe view of taking a copy of them. This was granted, and the books of\r\nTransits were subsequently copied under Mr Breen's superintendence.\r\n--The following paragraph is extracted from the Report to\r\nthe Visitors: 'In the Report of last year, I stated that our\r\nreductions had dropped considerably in arrear. I have the satisfaction\r\nnow of stating that this arrear and very much more have been\r\ncompletely recovered, and that the reductions are now in as forward a\r\nstate as at any time since my connection with the Observatory.' In\r\nfact the observations of 1842 were sent to press on Mar. 1st,\r\n1843.--About this year the Annual Dinner at the Visitation began to be\r\nmore important, principally under the management of Capt. W.H. Smyth,\r\nR.N.--In November I was enquiring about an 8-inch object-glass. I had\r\nalready in mind the furnishing of our meridional instruments with\r\ngreater optical powers.--On July 14th the Admiralty referred to me a\r\nMemorial of Mr J.G. Ulrich, a chronometer maker, claiming a reward for\r\nimprovements in chronometers. I took a great deal of trouble in the\r\ninvestigation of this matter, by books, witnesses, &c., and finally\r\nreported on Nov. 4th that there was no ground for claim.--In April I\r\nreceived the first application of the Royal Exchange Committee, for\r\nassistance in the construction of the Clock: this led to a great deal\r\nof correspondence, especially with Dent.--The Lunar Reductions were\r\ngoing on in full vigour.--I had much work in connection with the Cape\r\nObservatory: partly about an equatoreal required for the Observatory,\r\nbut chiefly in getting Maclear's work through the press.--In this year\r\nI began to think seriously of determining the longitude of Valencia in\r\nIreland, as a most important basis for the scale of longitude in these\r\nlatitudes, by the transmission of chronometers; and in August I went\r\nto Valencia and examined the localities. In September I submitted a\r\nplan to the Admiralty, but it was deferred.--The new Commission for\r\nrestoring the Standards was appointed on June 20th, I being Chairman.\r\nThe work of collecting standards and arranging plans was going on; Mr\r\nBaily attending to Standards of Length, and Prof. W.H. Miller to\r\nStandards of Weight. We held two meetings.--A small assistance was\r\nrendered to me by Mr Charles May (of the firm of Ransomes and May),\r\nwhich has contributed much to the good order of papers in the\r\nObservatory. Mr Robert Ransome had remarked my method of punching\r\nholes in the paper by a hand-punch, the places of the holes being\r\nguided by holes in a piece of card, and said that they could furnish\r\nme with something better. Accordingly, on Aug. 28th Mr May sent me the\r\npunching machine, the prototype of all now used in the Observatory.\r\n\r\n\"On Sept. 25th was made my proposal for an Altazimuth Instrument for\r\nmaking observations of the Moon's place more frequently and through\r\nparts of her orbit where she could never be observed with meridional\r\ninstruments; the most important addition to the Observatory since its\r\nfoundation. The Board of Visitors recommended it to the Admiralty,\r\nand the Admiralty sanctioned the construction of the instrument and\r\nthe building to contain it.\" The following passage is quoted from the\r\nAddress of the Astronomer Royal to the Board of Visitors at the\r\nSpecial Meeting of Nov. 10th, 1843: \"The most important object in the\r\ninstitution and maintenance of the Royal Observatory has always been\r\nthe Observations of the Moon. In this term I include the determination\r\nof the places of fixed stars which are necessary for ascertaining the\r\ninstrumental errors applicable to the instrumental observations of the\r\nMoon. These, as regards the objects of the institution, were merely\r\nauxiliaries: the history of the circumstances which led the Government\r\nof the day to supply the funds for the construction of the Observatory\r\nshews that, but for the demands of accurate Lunar Determinations as\r\naids to navigation, the erection of a National Observatory would never\r\nhave been thought of. And this object has been steadily kept in view\r\nwhen others (necessary as fundamental auxiliaries) were passed\r\nby. Thus, during the latter part of Bradley's time, and Bliss's time\r\n(which two periods are the least efficient in the modern history of\r\nthe Observatory), and during the latter part of Maskelyne's presidency\r\n(when, for years together, there is scarcely a single observation of\r\nthe declination of a star), the Observations of the Moon were kept up\r\nwith the utmost regularity. And the effect of this regularity, as\r\nregards its peculiar object, has been most honourable to the\r\ninstitution. The existing Theories and Tables of the Moon are founded\r\nentirely upon the Greenwich Observations; the Observatory of Greenwich\r\nhas been looked to as that from which alone adequate observations can\r\nbe expected, and from which they will not be expected in vain: and it\r\nis not perhaps venturing too much to predict that, unless some gross\r\ndereliction of duty by the managers of the Observatory should occur,\r\nthe Lunar Tables will always be founded on Greenwich Observations.\r\nWith this impression it has long been to me a matter of\r\nconsideration whether means should not be taken for rendering the\r\nseries of Observations of the Moon more complete than it can be made\r\nby the means at present recognized in our observatories.\"--In\r\nillustration of the foregoing remarks, the original inscription still\r\nremaining on the outside of the wall of the Octagon Room of the\r\nObservatory may be quoted. It runs thus: 'Carolus II's Rex Optimus\r\nAstronomiae et Nauticae Artis Patronus Maximus Speculam hanc in\r\nutriusque commodum fecit Anno D'ni MDCLXXVI Regni sui XXVIII curante\r\nIona Moore milite RTSG.'\r\n\r\n\"The Ashburton Treaty had been settled with the United States, for the\r\nboundary between Canada and the State of Maine, and one of its\r\nconditions was, that a straight line about 65 miles in length should\r\nbe drawn through dense woods, connecting definite points. It soon\r\nappeared that this could scarcely be done except by astronomical\r\noperations. Lord Canning, Under Secretary of the Foreign Office,\r\nrequested me to nominate two astronomers to undertake the work. I\r\nstrongly recommended that Military Officers should carry out the work,\r\nand Capt. Robinson and Lieut. Pipon were detached for this service. On\r\nMar. 1st they took lodgings at Greenwich, and worked at the\r\nObservatory every day and night through the month. My detailed\r\nastronomical instructions to them were drawn out on Mar. 29th. I\r\nprepared all the necessary skeleton forms, &c., and looked to their\r\nscientific equipment in every way. The result will be given in 1844.\r\n\r\n\"Of private history: In January I went to Dover with my wife to see\r\nthe blasting of a cliff there: we also visited Sir J. Herschel at\r\nHawkhurst. In April I was at Playford, on a visit to Arthur\r\nBiddell. On Apr. 9th my daughter Annot was born. From July 22nd to\r\nAugust 25th I was travelling in the South of Ireland, chiefly to see\r\nValencia and consider the question of determining its longitude:\r\nduring this journey I visited Lord Rosse at Birr Castle, and returned\r\nto Weymouth, where my family were staying at the time. In October I\r\nvisited Cambridge, and in December I was again at Playford.\"\r\n\r\nThe journey to Cambridge (Oct. 24th to 27th) was apparently in order\r\nto be present on the occasion of the Queen's visit there on the 25th:\r\nthe following letter relating to it was written to his wife:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                SEDGWICK'S ROOMS,\r\n                                           TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.\r\n                                          _1843, Oct. 26, Thursday_.\r\n\r\nI have this morning received your letter: I had no time to write\r\nyesterday. There are more things to tell of than I can possibly\r\nremember. The Dean of Ely yesterday was in a most ludicrous state of\r\nmisery because his servant had sent his portmanteau (containing his\r\nscarlet academicals as well as everything else) to London, and it went\r\nto Watford before it was recovered: but he got it in time to shew\r\nhimself to-day. Yesterday morning I came early to breakfast with\r\nSedgwick. Then I walked about the streets to look at the\r\nflags. Cambridge never had such an appearance before. In looking along\r\nTrinity Street or Trumpington Street there were arches and flags as\r\nclose as they could stand, and a cord stretched from King's Entrance\r\nto Mr Deck's or the next house with flags on all its length: a flag on\r\nSt Mary's, and a huge royal standard ready to hoist on Trinity\r\nGateway: laurels without end. I applied at the Registrar's office for\r\na ticket which was to admit me to Trinity Court, the Senate House,\r\n&c., and received from Peacock one for King's Chapel. Then there was\r\nan infinity of standing about, and very much I was fatigued, till I\r\ngot some luncheon at Blakesley's rooms at 1 o'clock. This was\r\nnecessary because there was to be no dinner in hall on account of the\r\nAddress presentation. The Queen was expected at 2, and arrived about\r\n10 minutes after 2. When she drove up to Trinity Gate, the\r\nVice-Chancellor, masters, and beadles went to meet her, and the\r\nbeadles laid down their staves, which she desired them to take\r\nagain. Then she came towards the Lodge as far as the Sundial, where\r\nWhewell as master took the college keys (a bundle of rusty keys tied\r\ntogether by a particularly greasy strap) from the bursar Martin, and\r\nhanded them to the Queen, who returned them. Then she drove round by\r\nthe turret-corner of the court to the Lodge door. Almost every member\r\nof the University was in the court, and there was a great hurraing\r\nexcept when the ceremonies were going forward. Presently the Queen\r\nappeared at a window and bowed, and was loudly cheered. Then notice\r\nwas given that the Queen and Prince would receive the Addresses of the\r\nUniversity in Trinity hall, and a procession was formed, in which I\r\nhad a good place, as I claimed rank with the Professors. A throne and\r\ncanopy were erected at the top of the hall, but the Queen did not sit,\r\nwhich was her own determination, because if she had sat it would have\r\nbeen proper that everybody should back out before presenting the\r\nAddress to the Prince: which operation would have suffocated at least\r\n100 people. The Queen wore a blue gown and a brown shawl with an\r\nimmense quantity of gold embroidery, and a bonnet. Then it was known\r\nthat the Queen was going to service at King's Chapel at half past\r\nthree: so everybody went there. I saw the Queen walk up the antechapel\r\nand she looked at nothing but the roof. I was not able to see her in\r\nchapel or to see the throne erected for her with its back to the\r\nTable, which has given great offence to many people. (I should have\r\nsaid that before the Queen came I called on Dr Haviland, also on\r\nScholefield, also on the Master of Christ's.) After this she returned\r\nto Trinity, and took into her head to look at the chapel. The cloth\r\nlaid on the pavement was not long enough and the undergraduates laid\r\ndown their gowns. Several of the undergraduate noblemen carried\r\ncandles to illuminate Newton's statue. After this the Prince went by\r\ntorchlight to the library. Then I suppose came dinner, and then it was\r\nmade known that at half-past nine the Queen would receive some Members\r\nof the University. So I rigged myself up and went to the levée at the\r\nLodge and was presented in my turn; by the Vice-Chancellor as\r\n\"Ex-Professor Airy, your Majesty's Astronomer Royal.\" The Queen and\r\nthe Prince stood together, and a bow was made to and received from\r\neach. The Prince recognised me and said \"I am glad to see you,\" or\r\nsomething like that. Next to him stood Goulburn, and next Lord\r\nLyndhurst, who to my great surprise spoke very civilly to me (as I\r\nwill tell you afterwards). The Queen had her head bare and a sort of\r\nFrench white gown and looked very well. She had the ribbon of the\r\nGarter on her breast; but like a ninny I forgot to look whether she\r\nhad the Garter upon her arm. The Prince wore his Garter. I went to bed\r\ndead tired and got up with a headache.--About the degree to the Prince\r\nand the other movements I will write again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a note from Cubitt relating to the blasting of the Round Down\r\nCliff at Dover referred to above:\r\n\r\n                                                  GREAT GEORGE STREET,\r\n                                                  _Jan. 20th, 1843_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n_Thursday_ next the 26th at 12 is the time fixed for the attempt to\r\nblow out the foot of the \"Round Down\" Cliff near Dover.\r\n\r\nThe Galvanic apparatus has been repeatedly tried in place--that is by\r\nexploding cartridges in the very chambers of the rock prepared for the\r\npowder--with the batteries at 1200 feet distance they are in full form\r\nand act admirably so that I see but little fear of failure on that\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThey have been rehearsing the explosions on the plan I most strongly\r\nrecommended, that is--to fire each chamber by an independent battery\r\nand circuit and to discharge the three batteries simultaneously by\r\nsignal or word of command which answers well and \"no mistake.\"\r\n\r\nI shall write to Sir John Herschel to-day, and remain\r\n\r\n        My dear Sir,\r\n          Very truly yours,\r\n            W. CUBITT.\r\n\r\nG.B. Airy, Esq.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from letters to his wife written in Ireland\r\nwhen on his journey to consider the determination of the longitude of\r\nValencia.\r\n\r\n                                                           SKIBBEREEN,\r\n                                                    _1843, July 28_.\r\n\r\nBy the bye, to shew the quiet of Ireland now, I saw in a newspaper at\r\nCork this account. At some place through which a repeal-association\r\nwas to pass (I forget its name) the repealers of the place set up a\r\ntriumphal arch. The police pulled it down, and were pelted by the\r\nrepealers, and one of the policemen was much bruised. O'Connell has\r\ndenounced this place as a disgrace to the cause of repeal, and has\r\nmoved in the full meeting that the inhabitants of this place be struck\r\noff the repeal list, with no exception but that of the parish priest\r\nwho was proved to be absent. And O'Connell declares that he will not\r\npass through this place. Now for my journey. It is a sort of\r\nhalf-mountain country all the way, with some bogs to refresh my eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       VALENCIA HOTEL,\r\n                                                   _1843, August 6_.\r\n\r\nIt seems that my coming here has caused infinite alarm. The common\r\npeople do not know what to conjecture, but have some notion that the\r\n\"sappers and miners\" are to build a bridge to admit the charge of\r\ncavalry into the island. An attendant of Mrs Fitzgerald expressed how\r\nstrange it was that a man looking so mild and gentle could meditate\r\nsuch things \"but never fear, Maam, those that look so mild are always\r\nthe worst\": then she narrated how that her husband was building some\r\nstables, but that she was demanding of him \"Pat, you broth of a boy,\r\nwhat is the use of your building stables when these people are coming\r\nto destroy everything.\" I suspect that the people who saw me walking\r\nup through the storm yesterday must have thought me the prince of the\r\npowers of the air at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              HIBERNIAN HOTEL, TRALEE,\r\n                                                   _1843, August 7_.\r\n\r\nI sailed from Valencia to Cahersiveen town in a sail-boat up the water\r\n(not crossing at the ferry). I had accommodated my time to the wish of\r\nthe boatman, who desired to be there in time for prayers: so that I\r\nhad a long waiting at Cahersiveen for the mail car. In walking through\r\nthe little town, I passed the chapel (a convent chapel) to which the\r\npeople were going: and really the scene was very curious. The chapel\r\nappeared to be overflowing full, and the court in front of it was full\r\nof people, some sitting on the ground, some kneeling, and some\r\nprostrate. There were also people in the street, kneeling with their\r\nfaces towards the gate pillars, &c. It seemed to me that the priest\r\nand the chapel were of less use here than even in the continental\r\nchurches, and I do not see why both parties should not have stopped at\r\nhome. When the chapel broke up, it seemed as if the streets were\r\ncrammed with people. The turnout that even a small village in Ireland\r\nproduces is perfectly amazing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1844\r\n\r\n\"In the course of 1843 I had put in hand the engraving of the drawings\r\nof the Northumberland Telescope at Cambridge Observatory, and wrote\r\nthe description for letterpress. In the course of 1844 the work was\r\ncompleted, and the books were bound and distributed.\r\n\r\n\"The building to receive the Altazimuth Instrument was erected in the\r\ncourse of the year; during the construction a foreman fell into the\r\nfoundation pit and broke his leg, of which accident he died. This is\r\nthe only accident that I have known at the Observatory.--The\r\nElectrometer Mast and sliding frame were erected near the Magnetic\r\nObservatory.--The six-year Catalogue of 1439 stars was finished; this\r\nwork had been in progress during the last few years.--In May I went to\r\nWoolwich to correct the compasses of the 'Dover,' a small iron steamer\r\ncarrying mails between Dover and Ostend: this I believe was the first\r\niron ship possessed by the Admiralty.--The Lunar Reductions were\r\nmaking good progress; 16 computers were employed upon them. I made\r\napplication for printing them and the required sum (_£1000_) was\r\ngranted by the Treasury.--In this year commenced that remarkable\r\nmovement which led to the discovery of Neptune. On Feb. 13th\r\nProf. Challis introduced Mr Adams to me by letter. On Feb. 15th I sent\r\nmy observed places of Uranus, which were wanted. On June 19th I also\r\nsent places to Mr E. Bouvard.--As regards the National Standards, Mr\r\nBaily (who undertook the comparisons relating to standards of length)\r\ndied soon, and Mr Sheepshanks then undertook the work.--I attended the\r\nmeeting of the British Association held at York (principally in\r\ncompliment to the President, Dr Peacock), and gave an oral account of\r\nmy work on Irish Tides.--At the Oxford Commemoration in June, the\r\nhonorary degree of D.C.L. was conferred on M. Struve and on me, and\r\nthen a demand was made on each of us for _£6. 6s._ for fees. We were\r\nmuch disgusted and refused to pay it, and I wrote angrily to Dr\r\nWynter, the Vice-Chancellor. The fees were ultimately paid out of the\r\nUniversity Chest.\r\n\r\n\"In this year the longitude of Altona was determined by M. Struve for\r\nthe Russian Government. For this purpose it was essential that\r\nfacilities should be given for landing chronometers at Greenwich. But\r\nthe consent of the customhouse authorities had first to be obtained,\r\nand this required a good deal of negotiation. Ultimately the\r\ndetermination was completed in the most satisfactory manner. The\r\nchronometers, forty-two in number, crossed the German Sea sixteen\r\ntimes. The transit observers were twice interchanged, in order to\r\neliminate not only their Personal Equation, but also the gradual\r\nchange of Personal Equation. On Sept. 30th Otto Struve formally wrote\r\nhis thanks for assistance rendered.\r\n\r\n\"For the determination of the longitude of Valencia, which was carried\r\nout in this year, various methods were discussed, but the plan of\r\nsending chronometers by mail conveyance was finally approved. From\r\nLondon to Liverpool the chronometers were conveyed by the railways,\r\nfrom Liverpool to Kingstown by steamer, from Dublin to Tralee by the\r\nMail Coaches, from Tralee to Cahersiveen by car, from Cahersiveen to\r\nKnightstown by boat, and from Knightstown to the station on the hill\r\nthe box was carried like a sedan-chair. There were numerous other\r\narrangements, and all succeeded perfectly without a failure of any\r\nkind. Thirty pocket chronometers traversed the line between Greenwich\r\nand Kingstown about twenty-two times, and that between Kingstown and\r\nValencia twenty times. The chronometrical longitudes of Liverpool\r\nObservatory, Kingstown Station, and Valencia Station are 12m 0.05s,\r\n24m 31.17s, 41m 23.25s; the geodetic longitudes, computed from\r\nelements which I published long ago in the Encyclopaedia\r\nMetropolitana, are 12m 0.34s, 24m 31.47s, 41m 23.06s. It appears from\r\nthis that the elements to which I have alluded represent the form of\r\nthe Earth here as nearly as is possible. On the whole, I think it\r\nprobable that this is the best arc of parallel that has ever been\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the Maine Boundary: on May 7th Col. Estcourt, the\r\nBritish Commissioner, wrote to me describing the perfect success of\r\nfollowing out my plan: the line of 64 miles was cut by directions laid\r\nout at the two ends, and the cuttings met within 341 feet. The country\r\nthrough which this line was to pass is described as surpassing in its\r\ndifficulties the conception of any European. It consists of\r\nimpervious forests, steep ravines, and dismal swamps. A survey for the\r\nline was impossible, and a tentative process would have broken the\r\nspirit of the best men. I therefore arranged a plan of operations\r\nfounded on a determination of the absolute latitudes and the\r\ndifference of longitudes of the two extremities. The difference of\r\nlongitudes was determined by the transfer of chronometers by the very\r\ncircuitous route from one extremity to the other; and it was necessary\r\nto divide the whole arc into four parts, and to add a small part by\r\nmeasure and bearing. When this was finished, the azimuths of the line\r\nfor the two ends were computed, and marks were laid off for starting\r\nwith the line from both ends. One party, after cutting more than\r\nforty-two miles through the woods, were agreeably surprised, on the\r\nbrow of a hill, at seeing directly before them a gap in the woods on\r\nthe next line of hill; it opened gradually, and proved to be the line\r\nof the opposite party. On continuing the lines till they passed\r\nabreast of each other, their distance was found to be 341 feet. To\r\nform an estimate of the magnitude of this error, it is to be observed\r\nthat it implies an error of only a quarter of a second of time in the\r\ndifference of longitudes; and that it is only one-third (or nearly so)\r\nof the error which would have been committed if the spheroidal form of\r\nthe Earth had been neglected. I must point out the extraordinary merit\r\nof the officers who effected this operation. Transits were observed\r\nand chronometers were interchanged when the temperature was lower than\r\n19° below zero: and when the native assistants, though paid highly,\r\ndeserted on account of the severity of the weather, the British\r\nofficers still continued the observations upon whose delicacy\r\neverything depended.\r\n\r\n\"Of private history: From July 3rd to Aug. 13th I was in Ireland with\r\nmy wife. This was partly a business journey in connection with the\r\ndetermination of the longitude of Valencia. On Jan. 4th I asked Lord\r\nLyndhurst (Lord Chancellor) to present my brother to the living of\r\nHelmingham, which he declined to do: but on Dec. 12th he offered\r\nBinbrooke, which I accepted for my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1845\r\n\r\n\"A map of the Buildings and Grounds of the Observatory was commenced\r\nin 1844, and was still in progress.--On Mar. 19th I was employed on a\r\nmatter which had for some time occupied my thoughts, viz., the\r\nre-arrangement of current manuscripts. I had prepared a sloping box\r\n(still in use) to hold 24 portfolios: and at this time I arranged\r\npapers A, and went on with B, C, &c. Very little change has been made\r\nin these.--In reference to the time given to the weekly report on\r\nMeteorology to the Registrar General, the Report to the Board of\r\nVisitors contains the following paragraph: 'The devotion of some of my\r\nassistants' time and labour to the preparation of the Meteorological\r\nReport attached to the weekly report of the Registrar General, is, in\r\nmy opinion, justified by the bearing of the meteorological facts upon\r\nthe medical facts, and by the attention which I understand that Report\r\nto have excited.'--On Dec. 13th the sleep of Astronomy was broken by\r\nthe announcement that a new planet, Astraea, was discovered by Mr\r\nHencke. I immediately circulated notices.--But in this year began a\r\nmore remarkable planetary discussion. On Sept. 22nd Challis wrote to\r\nme to say that Mr Adams would leave with me his results on the\r\nexplanation of the irregularities of Uranus by the action of an\r\nexterior planet. In October Adams called, in my absence. On Nov. 5th I\r\nwrote to him, enquiring whether his theory explained the irregularity\r\nof radius-vector (as well as that of longitude). I waited for an\r\nanswer, but received none. (See the Papers printed in the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society's Memoirs and Monthly Notices).--In the Royal\r\nSociety, the Royal Medal was awarded to me for my Paper on the Irish\r\nTides.--In the Royal Astronomical Society I was President; and, with a\r\nspeech, delivered the Medal to Capt. Smyth for the Bedford Catalogue\r\nof Double Stars.--On Jan. 21st I was appointed (with Schumacher) one\r\nof the Referees for the King of Denmark's Comet Medal: I have the\r\nKing's Warrant under his sign manual.--The Tidal Harbour Commission\r\ncommenced on Apr. 5th: on July 21st my Report on Wexford Harbour (in\r\nwhich I think I introduced important principles) was communicated. One\r\nReport was made this year to the Government.--In the matter of Saw\r\nMills (which had begun in 1842), I had prepared a second set of plans\r\nin 1844, and in this year Mr Nasmyth made a very favourable report on\r\nmy plan. A machinist of the Chatham Dock Yard, Sylvester, was set to\r\nwork (but not under my immediate command) to make a model: and this\r\nproduced so much delay as ultimately to ruin the design.--On Jan. 1st\r\nI was engaged on my Paper 'On the flexure of a uniform bar, supported\r\nby equal pressures at equidistant points.'\" (This was probably in\r\nconnection with the support of Standards of Length, for the\r\nCommission. Ed.).--In June I attended the Meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Cambridge, and on the 20th I gave a Lecture on\r\nMagnetism in the Senate House. The following quotation relating to\r\nthis Lecture is taken from a letter by Whewell to his wife (see Life\r\nof William Whewell by Mrs Stair Douglas): \"I did not go to the Senate\r\nHouse yesterday evening. Airy was the performer, and appears to have\r\noutdone himself in his art of giving clearness and simplicity to the\r\nhardest and most complex subjects. He kept the attention of his\r\naudience quite enchained for above two hours, talking about\r\nterrestrial magnetism.\"--On Nov. 29th I gave evidence before a\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons on Dover Harbour Pier.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the Magnetical and Meteorological Establishment, the\r\ntransactions in this year were most important. It had been understood\r\nthat the Government establishments had been sanctioned twice for\r\nthree-year periods, of which the second would expire at the end of\r\n1845: and it was a question with the scientific public whether they\r\nshould be continued. My own opinion was in favour of stopping the\r\nobservations and carefully discussing them. And I am convinced that\r\nthis would have been best, except for the subsequent introduction of\r\nself-registering systems, in which I had so large a share. There was\r\nmuch discussion and correspondence, and on June 7th the Board of\r\nVisitors resolved that 'In the opinion of the Visitors it is of the\r\nutmost importance that these observations should continue to be made\r\non the most extensive scale which the interests of those sciences may\r\nrequire.' The meeting of the British Association was held at Cambridge\r\nin June: and one of the most important matters there was the Congress\r\nof Magnetic Philosophers, many of them foreigners. It was resolved\r\nthat the Magnetic Observatory at Greenwich be continued\r\npermanently. At this meeting I proposed a resolution which has proved\r\nto be exceedingly important. I had remarked the distress which the\r\ncontinuous two-hourly observations through the night produced to my\r\nAssistants, and determined if possible to remove it. I therefore\r\nproposed 'That it is highly desirable to encourage by specific\r\npecuniary reward the improvement of self-recording magnetical and\r\nmeteorological apparatus: and that the President of the British\r\nAssociation and the President of the Royal Society be requested to\r\nsolicit the favourable consideration of Her Majesty's Government to\r\nthis subject,' which was adopted. In October the Admiralty expressed\r\ntheir willingness to grant a reward up to _£500_. Mr Charles Brooke\r\nhad written to me proposing a plan on Sept. 23rd, and he sent me his\r\nfirst register on Nov. 24th. On Nov. 1st the Treasury informed the\r\nAdmiralty that the Magnetic Observatories will be continued for a\r\nfurther period.\r\n\r\n\"The Railway Gauge Commission in this year was an important\r\nemployment. The Railways, which had begun with the Manchester and\r\nLiverpool Railway (followed by the London and Birmingham) had advanced\r\nover the country with some variation in their breadth of gauge. The\r\ngauge of the Colchester Railway had been altered to suit that of the\r\nCambridge Railway. And finally there remained but two gauges: the\r\nbroad gauge (principally in the system allied with the Great Western\r\nRailway); and the narrow gauge (through the rest of England). These\r\ncame in contact at Gloucester, and were likely to come in contact at\r\nmany other points--to the enormous inconvenience of the public. The\r\nGovernment determined to interfere, beginning with a Commission. On\r\nJuly 3rd Mr Laing (then on the Board of Trade) rode to Greenwich,\r\nbearing a letter of introduction from Sir John Lefevre and a request\r\nfrom Lord Dalhousie (President of the Board of Trade) that I would act\r\nas second of a Royal Commission (Col. Sir Frederick Smith, Airy, Prof.\r\nBarlow). I assented to this: and very soon began a vigorous course of\r\nbusiness. On July 23rd and 24th I went with Prof. Barlow and our\r\nSecretary to Bristol, Gloucester, and Birmingham: on Dec. 17th I went\r\non railway experiments to Didcot: and on Dec. 29th to Jan. 2nd I went\r\nto York, with Prof. Barlow and George Arthur Biddell, for railway\r\nexperiments. On Nov. 21st I finished a draft Report of the Railway\r\nGauge Commission, which served in great measure as a basis for that\r\nadopted next year.\r\n\r\n\"Of private history: I wrote to Lord Lyndhurst on Feb. 20th,\r\nrequesting an exchange of the living to which he had presented my\r\nbrother in Dec. 1844 for that of Swineshead: to which he\r\nconsented.--On Jan. 29th I went with my wife on a visit to my uncle\r\nGeorge Biddell, at Bradfield St George, near Bury.--On June 9th I went\r\ninto the mining district of Cornwall with George Arthur Biddell.--From\r\nAug. 25th to Sept. 26th I was travelling in France with my sister and\r\nmy wife's sister, Georgiana Smith. I was well introduced, and the\r\njourney was interesting.--On Oct. 29th my son Osmund was born.--Mr\r\nF. Baily bequeathed to me _£500_, which realized _£450_.\"\r\n\r\nHere are some extracts from letters written to his wife relating to\r\nthe visit to the Cornish mines, &c.--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             PEARCE'S HOTEL, FALMOUTH,\r\n                                        _1845, June 12th, Thursday_.\r\n\r\nThen we walked to the United Mines in Gwennap. The day was very fine\r\nand now it was perfectly broiling: and the hills here are long and\r\nsteep. At the United Mines we found the Captain, and he invited us to\r\njoin in a rough dinner, to which he and the other captains were going\r\nto sit down. Then we examined one of the great pumping engines, which\r\nis considered the best in the country: and some other engines. Between\r\n3 and 4 there was to be a setting out of some work to the men by a\r\nsort of Dutch Auction (the usual way of setting out the work here):\r\nsome refuse ores were to be broken up and made marketable, and the\r\nsubject of competition was, for how little in the pound on the gross\r\nproduce the men would work them up. While we were here a man was\r\nbrought up who was hurt in blasting: a piece of rock had fallen on\r\nhim. At this mine besides the ladder ways, they have buckets sliding\r\nin guides by which the men are brought up: and they are just preparing\r\nfor work another apparatus which they say is tried successfully at\r\nanother mine (Tresavean): there are two wooden rods _A_ and _B_\r\nreaching from the top to the bottom, moved by cranks from the same\r\nwheel, so that one goes up when the other goes down, and vice versâ:\r\neach of these rods has small stages, at such a distance that when the\r\nrod _A_ is down and the rod _B_ is up, the first stage of _A_ is level\r\nwith the first stage of _B_: but when the rod _A_ is up and the rod\r\n_B_ is down, the second stage of _A_ is level with the first stage of\r\n_B_: so a man who wants to descend steps on the first stage of _A_ and\r\nwaits till it goes down: then he steps sideways on the first stage of\r\n_B_ and waits till it goes down: then he steps sideways to the second\r\nstage of _A_ and waits till it goes down, and so on: or if a man is\r\ncoming up he does just the same. While we were here Mr R. Taylor\r\ncame. We walked home (a long step, perhaps seven miles) in a very hot\r\nsun. Went to tea to Mr Alfred Fox, who has a house in a beautiful\r\nposition looking to the outside of Falmouth Harbour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                             PENZANCE,\r\n                                          _1845, June 14, Saturday_.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning we breakfasted early at Falmouth, and before 9\r\nstarted towards Gwennap. I had ascertained on Thursday that John\r\nWilliams (the senior of a very wealthy and influential family in this\r\ncountry) was probably returned from London. So we drove first to his\r\nhouse Burntcoose or Barncoose, and found him and his wife at\r\nhome. (They are Quakers, the rest of the family are not.) Sedgwick,\r\nand Whewell, and I, or some of our party including me, had slept once\r\nat their house. They received George and me most cordially, and\r\npressed us to come and dine with them after our visit to Tresavean\r\nmine, of which intention I spoke in my last letter: so I named 4\r\no'clock as hour for dinner. After a little stay we drove to Tresavean,\r\nwhere I found the Captain of the mine prepared to send an Underground\r\nCaptain and a Pit-man to descend with us. So we changed our clothes\r\nand descended by the ladders in the pumpshaft. Pretty work to descend\r\nwith the huge pump-rods (garnished with large iron bolts) working\r\nviolently, making strokes of 12 feet, close to our elbows; and with a\r\nnearly bottomless pit at the foot of every ladder, where we had to\r\nturn round the foot of the ladder walking on only a narrow\r\nboard. However we got down to the bottom of the mine with great safety\r\nand credit, seeing all the mighty machinery on the way, to a greater\r\ndepth than I ever reached before, namely 1900 feet. From the bottom of\r\nthe pump we went aside a short distance into the lowest workings where\r\ntwo men nearly naked were driving a level towards the lode or vein of\r\nore. Here I felt a most intolerable heat: and upon moving to get out\r\nof the place, I had a dreadful feeling of feebleness and fainting,\r\nsuch as I never had in my life before. The men urged me to climb the\r\nladders to a level where the air was better, but they might as well\r\nhave urged me to lift up the rock. I could do nothing but sit down and\r\nlean fainting against the rocks. This arose entirely from the badness\r\nof the air. After a time I felt a trifle better, and then I climbed\r\none short ladder, and sat down very faint again. When I recovered, two\r\nmen tied a rope round me, and went up the ladder before me, supporting\r\na part of my weight, and in this way I ascended four or five ladders\r\n(with long rests between) till we came to a level, 260 fathoms below\r\nthe adit or nearly 300 fathoms below the surface, where there was a\r\ntolerable current of pretty good air. Here I speedily recovered,\r\nthough I was a little weak for a short time afterwards. George also\r\nfelt the bad air a good deal, but not so much as I. He descended to\r\nsome workings equally low in another place (towards which the party\r\nthat I spoke of were directing their works), but said that the air\r\nthere was by no means so bad. We all met at the bottom of the\r\nman-engine 260 fathoms below the adit. We sat still a little while,\r\nand I acquired sufficient strength and nerve, so that I did not feel\r\nthe slightest alarm in the operation of ascending by the\r\nman-engine. This is the funniest operation that I ever saw: it is the\r\nonly absolute novelty that I have seen since I was in the country\r\nbefore: it has been introduced 2-1/2 years in Tresavean, and one day\r\nin the United Mines. In my last letter I described the principle. In\r\nthe actual use there is no other motion to be made by the person who\r\nis ascending or descending than that of stepping sideways each time\r\n(there being proper hand-holds) with no exertion at all, except that\r\nof stepping exactly at the proper instant: and not the shadow of\r\nunpleasant feeling in the motion. Any woman may go with the most\r\nperfect comfort, if she will but attend to the rules of stepping, and\r\nforget that there is an open pit down to the very bottom of the\r\nmine. In this way we were pumped up to the surface, and came up as\r\ncool as cucumbers, instead of being drenched with perspiration. In my\r\ndescription in last letter I forgot to mention that between the stages\r\non the moving rods which I have there described there are intermediate\r\nstages on the moving rods (for which there is ample room, inasmuch as\r\nthe interval between the stages on each rod used by one person is 24\r\nfeet), and these intermediate stages are used by persons _descending_:\r\nso that there are persons _ascending_ and persons _descending_ at the\r\nsame time, who never interfere with each other and never step on the\r\nsame stages, but merely see each other passing on the other rods--It\r\nis a most valuable invention. We then changed our clothes and washed,\r\nand drove to Barncoose, arriving in good time for the dinner. I found\r\nmyself much restored by some superb Sauterne with water. When we were\r\nproposing to go on to Camborne, Mr and Mrs Williams pressed us so\r\naffectionately to stop that we at length decided on stopping for the\r\nnight, only bargaining for an early breakfast this morning. This\r\nmorning after breakfast, we started for Redruth and Camborne. The\r\npopulation between them has increased immensely since I was here\r\nbefore. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a letter written to his wife while he was engaged on the\r\nbusiness of the Railway Gauge Commission. It contains reminiscences of\r\nsome people who made a great figure in the railway world at that time,\r\nand was preceded by a letter which was playfully addressed \"From the\r\nPalace of King Hudson, York.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     GEORGE INN, YORK,\r\n                                                    _1845, Dec. 30_.\r\n\r\nI wrote yesterday from Mr Hudson's in time for the late post, and hope\r\nthat my letter might be posted by the servant to whom it was\r\ngiven. Our affairs yesterday were simple: we reached Euston Station\r\nproperly, found Watson there, found a carriage reserved for us, eat\r\npork-pie at Wolverton (not so good as formerly), dined at Derby, and\r\narrived in York at 5.20. On the way Watson informed me that the\r\nGovernment have awarded us _£500_ each. Sir F. Smith had talked over\r\nthe matter with us, and I laid it down as a principle that we\r\nconsidered the business as an important one and one of very great\r\nresponsibility, and that we wished either that the Government should\r\ntreat us handsomely or should consider us as servants of the State\r\nacting gratuitously, to which they assented. I think the Government\r\nhave done very well. Mr Hudson, as I have said, met us on the platform\r\nand pressed us to dine with him (though I had dined twice). Then we\r\nfound the rival parties quarrelling, and had to arrange between\r\nthem. This prevented me from writing for the early post. (I forgot to\r\nmention that Saunders, the Great Western Secretary, rode with us all\r\nthe way). At Hudson's we had really a very pleasant dinner: I sat\r\nbetween Vernon Harcourt and Mrs Malcolm (his sister Georgiana) and\r\nnear to Mr Hudson. This morning we were prepared at 9 at the Station\r\nfor some runs. Brunel and other people had arrived in the night. And\r\nwe have been to Darlington and back, with a large party in our\r\nexperimental train. George Arthur Biddell rode on the engine as\r\nrepresenting me. But the side wind was so dreadfully heavy that, as\r\nregards the wants of the case, this day is quite thrown away. We have\r\nsince been to lunch with Vernon Harcourt (Mrs Harcourt not at home)\r\nand then went with him to look at the Cathedral. The Chapter-house,\r\nwhich was a little injured, has been pretty well restored: all other\r\nthings in good order. The Cathedral looks smaller and lower than\r\nFrench cathedrals. Now that we have come in, the Lord Mayor of York\r\nhas just called to invite us to dinner to-morrow.--I propose to George\r\nArthur Biddell that he go to Newcastle this evening, in order to see\r\nglass works and other things there to-morrow, and to return when he\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nI think that I can persuade Barlow to stop to see the experiments out,\r\nand if so I shall endeavour to return as soon as possible. The\r\nearliest day would be the day after to-morrow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following extract is from a letter written to Mr Murray for\r\ninsertion in his Handbook of France, relating to the Breakwater at\r\nCherbourg, which Airy had visited during his journey in France in the\r\nautumn of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                   _1845, Oct. 8th_.\r\n\r\nMy opinion on the construction I need not say ought not to be quoted:\r\nbut you are quite welcome to found any general statement on it; or\r\nperhaps it may guide you in further enquiries. To make it clear, I\r\nmust speak rather generally upon the subject. There are three ways in\r\nwhich a breakwater may be constructed. 1. By building a strong wall\r\nwith perpendicular face from the bottom of the sea. 2. By making a\r\nbank with nothing but slopes towards the sea. 3. By making a sloping\r\nbank to a certain height and then building a perpendicular wall upon\r\nit.--Now if the 1st of these constructions could be arranged, I have\r\nno doubt that it would be the best of all, because a sea does not\r\n_break_ against a perpendicular face, but recoils in an unbroken\r\nswell, merely making a slow quiet push at the wall, and not making a\r\nviolent impact. But practically it is nearly impossible. The 2nd\r\nconstruction makes the sea to break tremendously, but if the sloping\r\nsurface be made of square stone put together with reasonable care\r\nthere is not the smallest tendency to unseat these stones. This is the\r\nprinciple of construction of Plymouth Breakwater. In the 3rd\r\nconstruction, the slope makes the sea to break tremendously, and then\r\nit strikes the perpendicular face with the force of a battering ram:\r\nand therefore in my opinion this is the worst construction of all. A\r\nfew face-stones may easily be dislodged, and then the sea entering\r\nwith this enormous force will speedily destroy the whole. This is the\r\nform of the Cherbourg Digue.\r\n\r\nFrom this you will gather that I have a full belief that Plymouth\r\nBreakwater will last very long, and that the Digue of Cherbourg, at\r\nleast its upper wall, will not last long. The great bank will last a\r\ngood while, gradually suffering degradation, but still protecting the\r\nRoad pretty well.\r\n\r\nI was assured by the officers residing on the Digue that the sea which\r\non breaking is thrown vertically upwards and then falls down upon the\r\npavement does sometimes push the stones about which are lying there\r\nand which weigh three or four tons.\r\n\r\nI saw some preparations for the foundations of the fort at the eastern\r\nextremity of the Digue. One artificial stone of concrete measured\r\n12'9\" × 6'7\" × 5'7\", and was estimated to weigh 25000 kilogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n               AT GREENWICH OBSERVATORY--1846 TO 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1846\r\n\r\n\"On Nov. 7th I proposed a change in the form of Estimates for the\r\nObservatory. The original astronomical part was provided by the\r\nAdmiralty, and the new magnetical and meteorological part was provided\r\nby the Treasury: and the whole Estimates and Accounts of the\r\nObservatory never appeared in one public paper. I proposed that the\r\nwhole should be placed on the Navy Estimates, but the Admiralty\r\nrefused. I repeated this in subsequent years, with no success.\r\nMeantime I always sent to the Admiralty a duplicate of my\r\nTreasury Estimate with the proper Admiralty Estimate.--Stephenson's\r\nRailway through the lower part of the Park, in tunnel about 850 feet\r\nfrom the Observatory, was again brought forward. On Feb. 20th it was\r\nput before me by the Government, and on March 9th I made experiments\r\nat Kensal Green, specially on the effect of a tunnel: which I found to\r\nbe considerable in suppressing the tremors. On May 6th I made my\r\nReport, generally favourable, supposing the railway to be in\r\ntunnel. On May 13th I, with Mr Stephenson, had an interview at the\r\nAdmiralty with Lord Ellenborough and Sir George Cockburn. The Earl\r\nappeared willing to relax in his scruples about allowing a railway\r\nthrough the Park, when Sir George Cockburn made a most solemn protest\r\nagainst it, on the ground of danger to an institution of such\r\nimportance as the Observatory. I have no doubt that this protest of\r\nSir George Cockburn's really determined the Government. On June 10th I\r\nwas informed that the Government refused their consent. After this the\r\nSouth Eastern Railway Company adopted the line through Tranquil\r\nVale.--In consequence of the defective state of Paramatta Observatory\r\nI had written to Sir Robert Peel on April 16th raising the question of\r\na General Superintending Board for Colonial Observatories: and on June\r\n27th I saw Mr Gladstone at the Colonial Office to enquire about the\r\npossibility of establishing local Boards. On June 29th a general plan\r\nwas settled, but it never came to anything.--Forty volumes of the\r\nObservatory MSS. were bound--an important beginning.--Deep-sunk\r\nthermometers were prepared by Prof. Forbes.--On June 22nd Sir Robert\r\nInglis procured an Order of the House of Commons for printing a paper\r\nof Sir James South's, ostensibly on the effects of a railway passing\r\nthrough Greenwich Park, but really attacking almost everything that I\r\ndid in the Observatory. I replied to this on July 21st by a letter in\r\nthe Athenaeum addressed to Sir Robert Inglis, in terms so strong and\r\nso well supported that Sir James South was effectually silenced.\" The\r\nfollowing extract from a letter of Airy's to the Earl of Rosse, dated\r\nDec. 15th 1846, will shew how pronounced the quarrel between Airy and\r\nSouth had become in consequence of the above-mentioned attack and\r\nprevious differences: \"After the public exposure which his conduct in\r\nthe last summer compelled me to make, I certainly cannot meet him on\r\nequal terms, and desire not to meet him at all.\" (Ed.).--\"In the\r\nMag. and Met. Department, I was constantly engaged with Mr Charles\r\nBrooke in the preparation and mounting of the self-registering\r\ninstruments, and the chemical arrangements for their use, to the end\r\nof the year. With Mr Ronalds I was similarly engaged: but I had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in transacting business with him, from his\r\nunpractical habits.--The equipment of the Liverpool Observatory, under\r\nme, was still going on: I introduced the use of Siemens's Chronometric\r\nGovernor for giving horary motion to an Equatoreal there. I have since\r\nintroduced the same principle in the Chronograph Barrel and the Great\r\nEquatoreal at Greenwich: I consider it important.--On Feb. 13th I\r\nreceived the Astronomical Society's Medal for the Planetary\r\nReductions.--In the University of London: At this time seriously began\r\nthe discussion whether there should be a compulsory examination in\r\nmatters bearing on religious subjects. After this there was no\r\npeace.--For discovery of Comets three medals were awarded by\r\nSchumacher and me: one to Peters, two to De Vico. A comet was seen by\r\nHind, and by no other observer: after correspondence, principally in\r\n1848, the medal was refused to him.--With respect to the Railway Gauge\r\nCommission: On Jan. 1st, in our experiments near York, the engine ran\r\noff the rails. On Jan. 29th the Commissioners signed the Report, and\r\nthe business was concluded by the end of April. Our recommendation was\r\nthat the narrow gauge should be carried throughout. This was opposed\r\nmost violently by partisans of the broad gauge, and they had\r\nsufficient influence in Parliament to prevent our recommendation from\r\nbeing carried into effect. But the policy, even of the Great Western\r\nRailway (in which the broad gauge originated), has supported our\r\nviews: the narrow gauge has been gradually substituted for the broad:\r\nand the broad now (1872) scarcely exists.--On June 20th Lord Canning\r\nenquired of me about makers for the clock in the Clock Tower of\r\nWestminster Palace. I suggested Vulliamy, Dent, Whitehurst; and made\r\nother suggestions: I had some correspondence with E. B. Denison, about\r\nclocks.--I had much correspondence with Stephenson about the Tubular\r\nBridge over the Menai Straits. Stephenson afterwards spoke of my\r\nassistance as having much supported him in this anxious work: on\r\nDec. 11th I was requested to make a Report, and to charge a fee as a\r\nCivil Engineer; but I declined to do so. In January I went, with\r\nGeorge Arthur Biddell, to Portsmouth, to examine Lord Dundonald's\r\nrotary engine as mounted in the 'Janus,' and made a Report on the same\r\nto the Admiralty: and I made several subsequent Reports on the same\r\nmatter. The scheme was abandoned in the course of next year; the real\r\ncause of failure, as I believe, was in the bad mounting in the ship.\r\n\r\n\"The engrossing subject of this year was the discovery of Neptune. As\r\nI have said (1845) I obtained no answer from Adams to a letter of\r\nenquiry. Beginning with June 26th of 1846 I had correspondence of a\r\nsatisfactory character with Le Verrier, who had taken up the subject\r\nof the disturbance of Uranus, and arrived at conclusions not very\r\ndifferent from those of Adams. I wrote from Ely on July 9th to\r\nChallis, begging him, as in possession of the largest telescope in\r\nEngland, to sweep for the planet, and suggesting a plan. I received\r\ninformation of its recognition by Galle, when I was visiting Hansen at\r\nGotha. For further official history, see my communications to the\r\nRoyal Astronomical Society, and for private history see the papers in\r\nthe Royal Observatory. I was abused most savagely both by English and\r\nFrench.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report to the Visitors contains an interesting account of the\r\nGreat Lunar Reductions, from which the following passage is extracted:\r\n\"Of the Third Section, containing the comparison of Observed Places\r\nwith Tabular Places, three sheets are printed, from 1750 to 1756. This\r\ncomparison, it is to be observed, does not contain a simple comparison\r\nof places, but contains also the coefficients of the various changes\r\nin the moon's place depending on changes in the elements.... The\r\nprocess for the correction of the elements by means of these\r\ncomparisons is now going on: and the extent of this work, even after\r\nso much has been prepared, almost exceeds belief. For the longitude,\r\nten columns are added in groups, formed in thirteen different ways,\r\neach different way having on the average about nine hundred\r\ngroups. For the ecliptic polar distance, five columns are added in\r\ngroups, formed in seven different ways, each different way having on\r\nthe average about nine hundred groups. Thus it will appear that there\r\nare not fewer than 150,000 additions of columns of figures. This part\r\nof the work is not only completed but is verified, so that the books\r\nof comparison of Observed and Tabular Places are, as regards this\r\nwork, completely cleared out. The next step is to take the means of\r\nthese groups, a process which is now in hand: it will be followed by\r\nthe formation and solution of the equations on which the corrections\r\nof the elements depend.\"\r\n\r\nThe following remarks, extracted from the Report to the Visitors, with\r\nrespect to the instrumental equipment of the Observatory, embody the\r\nviews of the Astronomer Royal at this time: \"The utmost change, which\r\nI contemplate as likely to occur in many years, in regard to our\r\nmeridional instruments, is the substitution of instruments of the same\r\nclass carrying telescopes of larger aperture. The only instrument\r\nwhich, as I think, may possibly be called for by the demands of the\r\nastronomer or the astronomical public, is a telescope of the largest\r\nsize, for the observation of faint nebulae and minute double\r\nstars. Whether the addition of such an instrument to our apparatus\r\nwould be an advantage, is, in my opinion, not free from doubt. The\r\nline of conduct for the Observatory is sufficiently well traced; there\r\ncan be no doubt that our primary objects ought to be the accurate\r\ndetermination of places of the fundamental Stars, the Sun, the\r\nPlanets, and, above all, the Moon. Any addition whatever to our powers\r\nor our instrumental luxuries, which should tend to withdraw our\r\nenergies from these objects, would be a misfortune to the\r\nObservatory.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"In March I visited Prof. Sedgwick at Norwich.--On\r\nMar. 28th the 'Sir Henry Pottinger' was launched from Fairbairn's Yard\r\non the Isle of Dogs, where I was thrown down and dislocated my right\r\nthumb.--From Apr. 10th to 15th I was at Playford.--On June 10th Prof.\r\nHansen arrived, and stayed with me to July 4th.--From July 6th to 10th\r\nI was visiting Dean Peacock at Ely.--From July 23rd to 29th I was at\r\nPlayford, where for the first time I lodged in my own cottage. I had\r\nbought it some time before, and my sister had superintended\r\nalterations and the addition of a room. I was much pleased thus to be\r\nconnected with the happy scenes of my youth.--From Aug. 10th to Oct.\r\n11th I was with my wife and her sister Elizabeth Smith on the\r\nContinent. We stayed for some time at Wiesbaden, as my nerves were\r\nshaken by the work on the Railway Gauge Commission, and I wanted the\r\nWiesbaden waters. We visited various places in Germany, and made a\r\n10-days' excursion among the Swiss Mountains. At Gotha we lodged with\r\nProf. Hansen for three days; and it was while staying here that I\r\nheard from Prof. Encke (on Sept. 29th) that Galle had discovered the\r\nexpected planet. We visited Gauss at Göttingen and Miss Caroline\r\nHerschel at Hannover. We had a very bad passage from Hamburgh to\r\nLondon, lasting five days: a crank-pin broke and had to be repaired:\r\nafter four days our sea-sickness had gone off, during the gale--a\r\nvaluable discovery for me, as I never afterwards feared\r\nsea-sickness.--On Dec. 22nd I attended the celebration of the 300th\r\nanniversary of Trinity College.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following extracts relating to the engines of the \"Janus\" are\r\ntaken from letters to his wife dated from Portsmouth, Jan. 6th and\r\n7th, 1846:\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible we repaired to the Dock Yard and presented\r\nourselves to the Admiral Superintendant--Admiral Hyde Parker (not Sir\r\nHyde Parker). Found that the \"Janus\" had not arrived: the Admiral\r\nSuperintendant (who does not spare a hard word) expressing himself\r\ncuriously thereon. But he had got the proper orders from the Admiralty\r\nrelating to me: so he immediately sent for Mr Taplin, the\r\nsuperintendant of machinery: and we went off to see the small engine\r\nof Lord D--d's construction which is working some pumps and other\r\nmachinery in the yard. It was kept at work a little longer than usual\r\nfor us to see it. And I have no hesitation in saying that it was\r\nworking extremely well. It had not been opened in any way for half a\r\nyear, and not for repair or packing for a much longer time.... This\r\nmorning we went to the Dock Yard, and on entering the engine house\r\nthere was Shirreff, and Lord D--d soon appeared. The \"Janus\" had come\r\nto anchor at Spithead late last night, and had entered the harbour\r\nthis morning. Blowing weather on Saturday night. We had the engine\r\npretty well pulled to pieces, and sat contemplating her a long\r\ntime. Before this Denison had come to us. We then went on board the\r\n\"Janus\" with Shirreff but not with Lord D--d. The engines were still\r\nhot, and so they were turned backwards a little for my edification.\r\n(This was convenient because, the vessel being moored by her\r\nhead, she could thus strain backwards without doing mischief.) The\r\nvacuum not good. Then, after a luncheon on board, it was agreed to run\r\nout a little way. But the engines absolutely stuck fast, and would not\r\nstir a bit. This I considered a perfect Godsend. So the paddle-wheels\r\n(at my desire) were lashed fast, and we are to see her opened\r\nto-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nThis morning (Jan. 7th) we all went off to the \"Janus,\" where we\r\nexpected to find the end of the cylinder (where we believe yesterday's\r\nblock to have taken place) withdrawn. But it was not near it. After a\r\ngreat many bolts were drawn, it was discovered that one bolt could not\r\nbe drawn, and in order to get room for working at it, it was necessary\r\nto take off the end of the other cylinder. And such a job!  Three\r\npulley hooks were broken in my sight, and I believe some out of my\r\nsight. However this auxiliary end was at last got off: and the people\r\nbegan to act on the refractory bolt. But by this time it was getting\r\ndark and the men were leaving the dockyard, so I left, arranging that\r\nwhat they could do in preparation for me might be done in good time\r\nto-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1847\r\n\r\n\"On Nov. 13th I circulated an Address, proposing to discontinue the\r\nuse of the Zenith Tube, because it had been found by a long course of\r\ncomparative trials that the Zenith Tube was not more accurate than the\r\nMural Circle. The Address stated that 'This want of superior\r\nefficiency of the Zenith Tube (which, considered in reference to the\r\nexpectations that had been formed of its accuracy, must be estimated\r\nas a positive failure) is probably due to two circumstances. One is,\r\nthe use of a plumb-line; which appears to be affected with various\r\nill-understood causes of unsteadiness. The other is, the insuperable\r\ndifficulty of ventilating the room in which the instrument is\r\nmounted.'--On December 20th I circulated an Address, proposing a\r\nTransit Circle, with telescope of 8 inches aperture. The Address\r\nstates as follows: 'The clear aperture of the Object-Glass of our\r\nTransit Instrument is very nearly 5 inches, that of our Mural Circle\r\nis very nearly 4 inches.'--I had been requested by the Master-General\r\nof Ordnance (I think) to examine Candidates for a Mastership in\r\nWoolwich Academy, and I was employed on it in February and March, in\r\nconjunction with Prof. Christie.--In January I applied to Lord\r\nAuckland for money-assistance to make an astronomical journey on the\r\nContinent, but he refused.--On Mar. 19th Sir James South addressed to\r\nthe Admiralty a formal complaint against me for not observing with the\r\nastronomical instruments: on Mar. 31st I was triumphantly acquitted by\r\nthe Admiralty.--In June I was requested by the Commissioners of\r\nRailways to act as President of a Commission on Iron Bridges\r\n(suggested by the fall of the bridge at Chester). Lord Auckland\r\nobjected to it, and I was not sorry to be spared the trouble of\r\nit.--In December I was requested, and undertook to prepare the\r\nAstronomical part of the Scientific Manual for Naval Officers.--On\r\nSept. 24th occurred a very remarkable Magnetic Storm, to which there\r\nhad been nothing comparable before. Mr Glaisher had it observed by eye\r\nextremely well, and I printed and circulated a paper concerning\r\nit.--Hansen, stimulated by the Lunar Reductions, discovered two long\r\ninequalities in the motion of the Moon, produced by the action of\r\nVenus. In the Report to the Visitors this matter is thus referred to:\r\n'In the last summer I had the pleasure of visiting Prof. Hansen at\r\nGotha, and I was so fortunate as to exhibit to him the corrections of\r\nthe elements from these Reductions, and strongly to call his attention\r\nto their certainty, the peculiarity of their fluctuations, and the\r\nnecessity of seeking for some physical explanation. I have much\r\npleasure in indulging in the thought, that it was mainly owing to this\r\nrepresentation that Prof. Hansen undertook that quest, which has\r\nterminated in the discovery of his two new lunar inequalities, the\r\nmost remarkable discovery, I think, in Physical Astronomy.'--In\r\ndiscussing points relating to the discovery of Neptune, I made an\r\nunfortunate blunder. In a paper hastily sent to the Athenaeum\r\n(Feb. 18th) I said that Arago's conduct had been indelicate. I\r\nperceived instantly that I had used a wrong expression, and by the\r\nvery next post I sent an altered expression. This altered expression\r\nwas not received in time, and the original expression was printed, to\r\nmy great sorrow. I could not then apologize. But at what appeared to\r\nbe the first opportunity, in December, I did apologize; and my apology\r\nwas accepted. But I think that Arago was never again so cordial as\r\nbefore.--On July 4th Hebe was discovered. After this Iris and\r\nFlora. Now commenced that train of discoveries which has added more\r\nthan 100 planets to the Solar System.--On Oct. 8th was an Annular\r\nEclipse of the Sun, of which the limit of annularity passed near to\r\nGreenwich. To determine the exact place, I equipped observatories at\r\nHayes, Lewisham South End, Lewisham Village, Blackwall, Stratford,\r\nWalthamstow, and Chingford. The weather was bad and no observation was\r\nobtained.--In the Royal Astronomical Society: In 1846, the dispute\r\nbetween the partisans of Adams and Le Verrier was so violent that no\r\nmedal could be awarded to either. In 1847 I (with other Fellows of the\r\nSociety) promoted a special Meeting for considering such a\r\nmodification of the bye-laws that for this occasion only it might be\r\npermissible to give two medals. After two days' stormy discussion, it\r\nwas rejected.--In the University of London: At a meeting in July,\r\nwhere the religious question was discussed, it was proposed to receive\r\nsome testimonial from affiliated bodies, or to consider that or some\r\nother plan for introducing religious literature. As the propriety of\r\nthis was doubtful, there was a general feeling for taking legal\r\nadvice: and it was set aside solely on purpose to raise the question\r\nabout legal consultation. _That_ was negatived by vote: and I then\r\nclaimed the consideration of the question which we had put aside for\r\nit. By the influence of H. Warburton, M.P., this was denied. I wrote a\r\nletter to be laid before the Meeting on July 28th, when I was\r\nnecessarily absent, urging my claim: my letter was put aside. I\r\ndetermined never to sit with Warburton again: on Aug. 2nd I intimated\r\nto Lord Burlington my wish to retire, and on Aug. 29th he transmitted\r\nto the Home Secretary my resignation. He (Lord Burlington) fully\r\nexpressed his opinion that my claim ought to have been allowed.--On\r\nJune 9th, on the occasion of Prince Albert's state visit to Cambridge,\r\nknighthood was offered to me through his Secretary, Prof. Sedgwick,\r\nbut I declined it.--In September, the Russian Order of St Stanislas\r\nwas offered to me, Mr De Berg, the Secretary of Embassy, coming to\r\nGreenwich personally to announce it: but I was compelled by our\r\nGovernment Rules to decline it.--I invited Le Verrier to England, and\r\nescorted him to the Meeting of the British Association at Oxford in\r\nJune.--As regards the Westminster Clock on the Parliamentary Building:\r\nin May I examined and reported on Dent's and Whitehurst's clock\r\nfactories. Vulliamy was excessively angry with me. On May 31st a great\r\nParliamentary Paper was prepared in return to an Order of the House of\r\nLords for correspondence relating to the Clock.--With respect to the\r\nSaw Mills for Ship Timber: work was going on under the direction of\r\nSylvester to Mar. 18th. It was, I believe, at that time, that the\r\nfire occurred in Chatham Dock Yard which burnt the whole of the\r\nsaw-machinery. I was tired of my machinery: and, from the extending\r\nuse of iron ships, the probable value of it was much diminished; and I\r\nmade no effort to restore it.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"In February I went to Derby to see Whitehurst's\r\nclock factory; and went on with my wife to Brampton near Chesterfield,\r\nwhere her mother was living.--From Apr. 1st to 5th I was at\r\nPlayford.--On Holy Thursday, I walked the Parish Bounds (of Greenwich)\r\nwith the Parish officers and others. From Apr. 19th to 24th I was at\r\nBirmingham (on a visit to Guest, my former pupil, and afterwards\r\nMaster of Caius College) and its neighbourhood, with George Arthur\r\nBiddell.--From June 23rd to 28th I was at Oxford and Malvern: my\r\nsister was at Malvern, for water-cure: the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation was at Oxford and I escorted Le Verrier thither.--July\r\n28th to 30th I was at Brampton.--From August 10th to September 18th I\r\nwas engaged on an expedition to St Petersburg, chiefly with the object\r\nof inspecting the Pulkowa Observatory. I went by Hamburg to Altona,\r\nwhere I met Struve, and started with him in an open waggon for Lübeck,\r\nwhere we arrived on Aug. 14th. We proceeded by steamer to Cronstadt\r\nand Petersburg, and so to Pulkowa, where I lodged with O. Struve. I\r\nwas here engaged till Sept. 4th, in the Observatory, in expeditions in\r\nthe neighbourhood and at St Petersburg, and at dinner-parties, &c. I\r\nmet Count Colloredo, Count Ouvaroff, Count Stroganoff, Lord Bloomfield\r\n(British Ambassador), and others. On Sept. 4th I went in a small\r\nsteamer to Cronstadt, and then in the Vladimir to Swinemünde: we were\r\nthen towed in a passage boat to Stettin, and I proceeded by railway to\r\nBerlin. On Sept. 9th I found Galle and saw the Observatory. On\r\nSept. 10th I went to Potzdam and saw Humboldt. On the 12th I went to\r\nHamburg and lodged with Schumacher: I here visited Repsold and\r\nRümker. On Sept. 14th I embarked in the John Bull for London, and\r\narrived there on the evening of the 18th: on the 16th it was blowing\r\n'a whole gale,' reported to be the heaviest gale known for so many\r\nhours; 4 bullocks and 24 sheep were thrown overboard.--From Dec. 3rd\r\nto 8th I was at Cambridge, and from the 22nd to 31st at Playford.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a letter to his wife written from Birmingham, containing a\r\nnote of the progress of the ironwork for the Menai Bridge:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                EDGBASTON, BIRMINGHAM,\r\n                                                    _1847, Apr. 22_.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning we started between 10 and 11 for Stourbridge, first\r\nto see some clay which is celebrated all over the world as the only\r\nclay which is fit to make pots for melting glass, &c. You know that in\r\nall these fiery regions, fire-clay is a thing of very great\r\nimportance, as no furnace will stand if made of any ordinary bricks\r\n(and even with the fire-clay, the small furnaces are examined every\r\nweek), but this Stourbridge clay is as superior to fire-clay as\r\nfire-clay is to common brick-earth. Then we went to Fosters' puddling\r\nand rolling works near Stourbridge. These are on a very large scale:\r\nof course much that we saw was a repetition of what we had seen\r\nbefore, but there were slitting mills, machines for rolling the\r\npuddled blooms instead of hammering them, &c., and we had the\r\nsatisfaction of handling the puddling irons ourselves. Then we went to\r\nanother work of the Fosters not far from Dudley, where part of the\r\nwork of the Tube Bridge for the Menai is going on. The Fosters are, I\r\nbelieve, the largest iron masters in the country, and the two\r\nprincipal partners, the elder Mr Foster and his Nephew, accompanied us\r\nin all our inspections and steppings from one set of works to another.\r\nThe length of Tube Bridge which they have in hand here is only 120\r\nfeet, about 1/4 of the whole length: and at present they are only busy\r\non the bottom part of it: but it is a prodigious thing. I shall be\r\nanxious about it. Then we went to other works of the Fosters' at\r\nKing's Wynford, where they have blast furnaces: and here after seeing\r\nall other usual things we saw the furnaces tapped. In this district\r\nthe Fosters work the 10-yard coal in a way different from any body\r\nelse: they work out the upper half of its thickness and then leave the\r\nground to fall in: after a year or two this ground becomes so hard as\r\nto make a good safe roof, and then they work away the other half: thus\r\nthey avoid much of the danger and difficulty of working the thick bed\r\nall at once. The ventilation of these mines scarcely ever requires\r\nfires, and then only what they call \"lamps,\" those little fire-places\r\nwhich are used for giving light at night. (In the Northumberland and\r\nDurham pits, they constantly have immense roaring fires to make a\r\ndraught.) Then we came home through Dudley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Russia, there was a great desire manifested by the\r\nastronomers and scientific men of Russia that he should be presented\r\nto the Emperor. This would no doubt have taken place had not the\r\nmovements of the Court and his own want of time prevented it. The\r\nfollowing letter to the British Ambassador, Lord Bloomfield, relates\r\nto this matter:\r\n\r\n                                                              PULKOWA,\r\n                                                _1847, August 25th_.\r\n                                                _Wednesday evening_.\r\n\r\nMY LORD,\r\n\r\nI had the honour yesterday to receive your Lordship's note of Sunday\r\nlast, which by some irregularity in the communications with this place\r\nreached me, I believe, later than it ought. From this circumstance,\r\nand also from my being made acquainted only this afternoon with some\r\nofficial arrangements, I am compelled to trouble you at a time which I\r\nfear is less convenient than I could have desired.\r\n\r\nThe object of my present communication is, to ask whether (if the\r\nmovements of the Court permit it) it would be agreeable to your\r\nLordship to present me to the Emperor. In explanation of this enquiry,\r\nI beg leave to state that this is an honour to which, personally, I\r\ncould not think of aspiring. My presence however at Pulkowa at this\r\ntime is in an official character. As Astronomer Royal of England, I\r\nhave thought it my duty to make myself perfectly acquainted with the\r\nObservatory of Pulkowa, and this is the sole object of my journey to\r\nRussia. It is understood that the Emperor takes great interest in the\r\nreputation of the Observatory, and I am confident that the remarks\r\nupon it which I am able to make would be agreeable to him.\r\n\r\nI place these reasons before you, awaiting entirely Your Lordship's\r\ndecision on the propriety of the step to which I have alluded. I am\r\nto leave St Petersburg on Saturday the 4th of September.\r\n\r\n        I have the honor to be\r\n            My Lord,\r\n          Your Lordship's very faithful servant,\r\n              G.

In virtue of this relation I\r\nhave the honour to lay before your Lordship the following statement,\r\nand to solicit your instructions thereon.\r\n\r\nFor conducting with efficiency and with credit to the nation the\r\ninstitution which is entrusted to me, I have judged it proper to\r\ncultivate intimate relations with the principal Observatories of\r\nEurope, and in particular with the great Observatory founded by the\r\nEmperor of Russia at Pulkowa near St Petersburg. I have several times\r\nreceived Mr Struve, the Director of that Observatory, at Greenwich:\r\nand in the past summer I made a journey to St Petersburg for the\r\npurpose of seeing the Observatory of Pulkowa.\r\n\r\nSince my return from Russia, I have received a communication from\r\nCount Ouvaroff, Minister of Public Instruction in the Russian Empire,\r\ninforming me that the Emperor of Russia desires to confer on me the\r\ndecoration of Knight Commander in the second rank of the Order of St\r\nStanislas.\r\n\r\nAnd I have the honour now to enquire of your Lordship whether it is\r\npermitted to me to accept from the Emperor of Russia this decoration.\r\n\r\n        I have the honour to be,\r\n            My Lord,\r\n          Your Lordship's very obedient servant,\r\n              G.B.

That no Subject of Her Majesty could be allowed to accept the\r\nInsignia of a Foreign Order from any Sovereign of a Foreign State,\r\nexcept they shall be so conferred in consequence of active and\r\ndistinguished services before the Enemy, either at Sea, or in the\r\nField; or unless he shall have been actually employed in the Service\r\nof the Foreign Sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the stringency of this Regulation, it is my duty now\r\nto state to your Excellency that I am unable to accept the decoration\r\nwhich His Majesty the Emperor of Russia was pleased, through your\r\nExcellency, to offer to me.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to repeat the expression of my profound reverence to His\r\nMajesty and of my deep sense of the honor which he has done me.\r\n\r\n        I have the honor to be,\r\n            Sir,\r\n          Your Excellency's very faithful\r\n              and obedient servant,\r\n                G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_To His Excellency\r\n  Count Ouvaroff,\r\n    &c. &c._\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following year a very handsome gold medal,\r\nspecially struck, was transmitted by Count Ouvaroff on the part of the\r\nEmperor of Russia, to Mr Airy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1848\r\n\r\n\"In April I received authority to purchase of Simms an 8-inch\r\nobject-glass for the new Transit Circle for _£300_. The glass was\r\ntested and found satisfactory. While at Playford in January I drew the\r\nfirst plans of the Transit Circle: and C. May sketched some\r\nparts. Definite plans were soon sent to Ransomes and May, and to Simms\r\nin March. The instrument and the building were proceeded with during\r\nthe year. The New Transit Circle was to be erected in the Circle\r\nRoom, and considerable arrangement was necessary for continuing the\r\nCircle Observations with the existing instruments, whilst the new\r\ninstrument was under erection. When the new Transit is completely\r\nmounted, the old Transit Instrument may be removed, and the Transit\r\nRoom will be free for any other purpose. I propose to take it as\r\nPrivate Room for the Astronomer Royal.--On May 12th I made my first\r\nproposal of the Reflex Zenith Tube. The principle of it is as follows:\r\nLet the micrometer be placed close to the object-glass, the frame of\r\nthe micrometer being firmly connected with the object-glass cell, and\r\na reflecting eye-piece being used with no material tube passing over\r\nthe object-glass: and let a basin of quicksilver be placed below the\r\nobject-glass, but in no mechanical connection with it, at a distance\r\nequal to half the focal length of the object-glass. Such an\r\ninstrument would at least be free from all uncertainties of twist of\r\nplumb-line, viscosity of water, attachment of upper plumb-line\r\nmicroscope, attachment of lower plumb-line microscope, and the\r\nobservations connected with them: and might be expected, as a result\r\nof this extreme simplicity, to give accurate results.--A considerable\r\nerror was discovered in the graduation of Troughton's Circle,\r\namounting in one part to six seconds, which is referred to as follows:\r\n'This instance has strongly confirmed me in an opinion which I have\r\nlong held--that no independent division is comparable in general\r\naccuracy to engine-division,--where the fundamental divisions of the\r\nengine have been made by Troughton's method, and where in any case the\r\ndetermination by the astronomer of errors of a few divisions will\r\nsuffice, in consequence of the uniformity of law of error, to give the\r\nerrors of the intermediate divisions.'--The method of observing with\r\nthe Altazimuth is carefully described, and the effect of it, in\r\nincreasing the number of observations of the Moon, is thus given for\r\nthe thirteen lunations between 1847, May 15, and 1848, May 30. 'Number\r\nof days of complete observations with the Meridional Instruments, 111;\r\nnumber of days of complete observations with Altitude and Azimuth\r\nInstrument, 203. The results of the observations appear very good;\r\nperhaps a little, and but a little, inferior to those of the\r\nMeridional Instruments. I consider that the object for which this\r\ninstrument was erected is successfully attained.'--Being satisfied\r\nwith the general efficiency of the system arranged by Mr Brooke for\r\nour photographic records (of magnetical observations) I wrote to the\r\nAdmiralty in his favour, and on Aug. 25th the Admiralty ordered the\r\npayment of _£500_ to him. A Committee of the Royal Society also\r\nrecommended a reward of _£250_ to Mr Ronalds, which I believe was paid\r\nto him.--On May 1st the last revise of the Lunar Reductions was\r\npassed, and on May 5th, 500 copies were sent for binding.--In this\r\nyear Schumacher and I refused a medal to Miss Mitchell for a Comet\r\ndiscovered, because the rules of correspondence had not been strictly\r\nfollowed: the King of Denmark gave one by special favour.--In this\r\nyear occurred the discovery of Saturn's 8th Satellite by Mr Lassell:\r\nupon which I have various correspondence.--On the 18th of December the\r\ndegree of LL.D. was conferred upon me by the University of\r\nEdinburgh.--The Ipswich Lectures: A wish had been expressed that I\r\nwould give a series of Astronomical Lectures to the people of\r\nIpswich. I therefore arranged with great care the necessary apparatus,\r\nand lectured six evenings in a room (I forget its name--it might be\r\nTemperance Hall--high above St Matthew's Street), from Mar. 13th to\r\nthe end of the week. A shorthand writer took them down: and these\r\nformed the 'Ipswich Lectures,' which were afterwards published by the\r\nIpswich Museum (for whose benefit the lectures were given) and by\r\nmyself, in several editions, and afterwards by Messrs Macmillan in\r\nrepeated editions under the title of 'Airy's Popular Astronomy.'--It\r\nhad been found necessary to include under one body all the unconnected\r\nCommissions of Sewers for the Metropolis, and Lord Morpeth requested\r\nme to be a member. Its operations began on Oct. 28th. In constitution\r\nit was the most foolish that I ever knew: consisting of, I think, some\r\n200 persons, who could not possibly attend to it. It came to an end in\r\nthe next year.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"I was at Playford from Jan. 1st to 11th, and\r\nagain from Jan. 17th to 25th: also at Playford from June 21st to July\r\n12th.--From Aug. 23rd to Sept. 12th I was in Ireland on a visit to\r\nLord Rosse at Parsonstown, chiefly engaged on trials of his large\r\ntelescope. I returned by Liverpool, where I inspected the Liverpool\r\nEquatoreal and Clockwork, and examined Mr Lassell's telescopes and\r\ngrinding apparatus.--From Dec. 6th to 20th I was at Edinburgh with my\r\nwife, on a visit to Prof. J. D. Forbes. We made various excursions,\r\nand I attended lectures by Prof. Wilson and Sir W. Hamilton: on the\r\n18th I gave a lecture in Prof. Forbes's room. I received the Honorary\r\nDegree of LL.D., and made a statement on the Telescopes of Lord Rosse\r\nand Mr Lassell to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Returned to\r\nGreenwich by Brampton.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a reminiscence of the \"Ipswich Lectures,\" in a letter to his\r\nwife, dated Playford, 1848 Mar. 14, \"At the proper time I went to the\r\nhall: found a chairman installed (Mr Western): was presented to him,\r\nand by him presented to the audience: made my bow and commenced. The\r\nroom was quite full: I have rarely seen such a sea of faces; about 700\r\nI believe. Everything went off extremely well, except that the rollers\r\nof the moving piece of sky would squeak: but people did not mind it:\r\nand when first a star passed the meridian, then Jupiter, then some\r\nstars, and then Saturn, he was much applauded. Before beginning I gave\r\nnotice that I should wait to answer questions: and as soon as the\r\nlecture was finished the Chairman repeated this and begged people to\r\nask. So several people did ask very pertinent questions (from the\r\nbenches) shewing that they had attended well. Others came up and\r\nasked questions.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from letters written to his wife while on\r\nhis visit to Lord Rosse at Parsonstown in Ireland. On the way he\r\nstopped at Bangor and looked at the Tubular Bridge Works, which are\r\nthus referred to: \"Stopped at Bangor, settled _pro tem_. at the\r\nCastle, and then walked past the Suspension Bridge towards the Tube\r\nWorks, which are about 1-1/2 mile south-west of the Suspension Bridge.\r\nThe way was by a path through fields near the water side: and from one\r\nor two points in this, the appearance of the Suspension Bridge was\r\nmost majestic. The Tube Bridge consists of four spans, two over water\r\nand two over sloping land. The parts for the double tube over the\r\nwater spans (four lengths of tube) are building on a platform as at\r\nConway, to be floated by barges as there: the parts over the sloping\r\nbanks are to be built in their place, on an immense scaffolding. I\r\nsuspect that, in regard to these parts, Stephenson is sacrificing a\r\ngreat deal of money to uniformity of plan: and that it would have been\r\nmuch cheaper to build out stone arches to the piers touching the\r\nwater.... The Tube Works are evidently the grand promenade of the\r\nidlers about Bangor: I saw many scores of ladies and gentlemen walking\r\nthat way with their baskets of provision, evidently going to gipsy in\r\nthe fields close by.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              THE CASTLE, PARSONSTOWN,\r\n                                                    _1848, Aug. 29_.\r\n\r\nAfter tea it was voted that the night was likely to be fine, so we all\r\nturned out. The night was uncertain: sometimes entirely clouded,\r\nsometimes partially, but objects were pretty well seen when the sky\r\nwas clear: the latter part was much steadier. From the interruption by\r\nclouds, the slowness of finding with and managing a large instrument\r\n(especially as their finding apparatus is not perfectly arranged) and\r\nthe desire of looking well at an object when we had got it, we did not\r\nlook at many objects. The principal were, Saturn and the Annular\r\nNebula of Lyra with the 3-feet; Saturn, a remarkable cluster of stars,\r\nand a remarkable planetary nebula, with the 6-feet. With the large\r\ntelescope, the evidence of the quantity of light is prodigious. And\r\nthe light of an object is seen in the field without any colour or any\r\nspreading of stray light: and it is easy to see that the vision with a\r\nreflecting telescope may be much more perfect than with a\r\nrefractor. With these large apertures, the rings round the stars are\r\ninsensible. The planetary nebula looked a mass of living and intensely\r\nbrilliant light: this is an object which I do not suppose can be seen\r\nat all in our ordinary telescopes. The definition of the stars near\r\nthe zenith is extremely good: with a high power (as 800) they are\r\npoints or very nearly so--indeed I believe quite so--so that it is\r\nclear that the whole light from the great 6-feet mirror is collected\r\ninto a space not bigger than the point of a needle. But in other\r\npositions of the telescope the definition is not good: and we must\r\nlook to-day to see what is the cause of this fault. It is not a fault\r\nin the telescope, properly so-called, but it is either a tilt of the\r\nmirror, or an edge-pressure upon the mirror when the telescope points\r\nlower down which distorts its figure, or something of that kind. So I\r\ncould not see Saturn at all well, for which I was sorry, as I could so\r\nwell have compared his appearance with what I have seen before. I\r\nshall be very much pleased if we can make out what is the fault of\r\nadjustment, and so correct it as to get good images everywhere. It is\r\nevident that the figuring of the mirror, the polishing, and the\r\ngeneral arrangement, are perfectly managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              THE CASTLE, PARSONSTOWN,\r\n                                                    _1848, Aug. 30_.\r\n\r\nYesterday we were employed entirely about the Great Telescope,\r\nbeginning rather late. The principal objects had relation to the fault\r\nof definition when the telescope is pointed low (which I had remarked\r\non the preceding night), and were, to make ourselves acquainted with\r\nthe mechanism of the mirror's mounting generally, and to measure in\r\nvarious ways whether the mirror actually does shift its place when the\r\ntelescope is set to different angles of elevation. For the latter we\r\nfound that the mirror actually does tilt 1/4 of an inch when the tube\r\npoints low. This of itself will not account for the fault but it\r\nindicates that the lower part is held fast in a way that may cause a\r\nstrain which would produce the fault. These operations and reasonings\r\ntook a good deal of time. Lord Rosse is disposed to make an alteration\r\nin the mounting for the purpose of correcting this possible strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              THE CASTLE, PARSONSTOWN,\r\n                                                    _1848, Aug. 31_.\r\n\r\nThe weather here is still vexatious: but not absolutely repulsive.\r\nYesterday morning Lord Rosse arranged a new method of suspending the\r\ngreat mirror, so as to take its edgewise pressure in a manner that\r\nallowed the springy supports of its flat back to act. This employed\r\nhis workmen all day, so that the proposed finish of polishing the new\r\nmirror could not go on. I took one Camera Lucida sketch of the\r\ninstrument in the morning, dodging the heavy showers as well as I\r\ncould; then, as the afternoon was extremely fine, I took another, with\r\nmy head almost roasted by the sun. This last view is extremely pretty\r\nand characteristic, embracing parts of the mounting not shewn well in\r\nthe others, and also shewing the Castle, the Observatory, and the\r\n3-feet telescope. The night promised exceedingly well: but when we got\r\nactually to the telescope it began to cloud and at length became\r\nhopeless. However I saw that the fault which I had remarked on the two\r\npreceding nights was gone. There is now a slight exhibition of another\r\nfault to a much smaller extent. We shall probably be looking at the\r\ntelescope to-day in reference to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              THE CASTLE, PARSONSTOWN,\r\n                                                    _1848, Sept. 1_.\r\n\r\nYesterday we made some alterations in the mounting of the great\r\nmirror. We found that sundry levers were loose which ought to be firm,\r\nand we conjectured with great probability the cause of this, for\r\ncorrection of which a change in other parts was necessary. The mirror\r\nwas then found to preserve its position much more fixedly than\r\nbefore.... At night, upon trying the telescope, we found it very\r\nfaulty for stars near the zenith, where it had been free from fault\r\nbefore. The screws which we had driven hard were then loosened, and\r\nimmediately it was made very good. Then we tried with some lower\r\nobjects, and it was good, almost equally good, there. For Saturn it\r\nwas very greatly superior to what it had been before. Still it is not\r\nsatisfactory to us, and at this time a strong chain is in preparation,\r\nto support the mirror edgeways instead of the posts that there were at\r\nfirst or the iron hoop which we had on it yesterday.\r\n\r\nNobody would have conceived that an edgewise gripe of such a mass of\r\nmetal could derange its form in this way.\r\n\r\nLast night was the finest night we have had as regards clouds, though\r\nperhaps not the best for definition of objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              THE CASTLE, PARSONSTOWN,\r\n                                                    _1848, Sept. 2_.\r\n\r\nI cannot learn that the fault in the mirror had been noticed before,\r\nbut I fancy that the observations had been very much confined to the\r\nZenith and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1849\r\n\r\n\"In July the new constant-service water-pipes to the Observatory were\r\nlaid from Blackheath. Before this time the supply of water to the\r\nObservatory had been made by a pipe leading up from the lower part of\r\nthe Park, and was not constant.--In May the new staircase from my\r\ndwelling-house to the Octagon Room was commenced.--In the Report to\r\nthe Visitors there is a curious account of Mr Breen's (one of the\r\nAssistants) personal equation, which was found to be different in\r\nquantity for observations of the Moon and observations of the\r\nStars.--The most important set of observations (of planets) was a\r\nseries of measures of Saturn in four directions, at the time when his\r\nring had disappeared. They appear completely to negative the idea that\r\nSaturn's form differs sensibly from an ellipsoid.--Among the General\r\nRemarks of the Report the following appears: 'Another change (in\r\nprospect) will depend on the use of galvanism; and as a probable\r\ninstance of the application of this agent, I may mention that,\r\nalthough no positive step has hitherto been taken, I fully expect in\r\nno long time to make the going of all the clocks in the Observatory\r\ndepend on one original regulator. The same means will probably be\r\nemployed to increase the general utility of the Observatory, by the\r\nextensive dissemination throughout the kingdom of accurate\r\ntime-signals, moved by an original clock at the Royal Observatory; and\r\nI have already entered into correspondence with the authorities of the\r\nSouth Eastern Railway (whose line of galvanic communication will\r\nshortly pass within nine furlongs of the Observatory) in reference to\r\nthis subject.'--I agreed with Schumacher in giving no medal to Mr\r\nG. P. Bond; his comet was found to be Petersen's. Five medals were\r\nawarded for comets in 1847 (Hind, Colla, Mauvais, Brorsen,\r\nSchweizer).--The Liverpool Observatory was finished this year: and the\r\nthanks of the Town Council were presented to me.--Respecting Fallows's\r\nObservations at the Cape of Good Hope: I had received the Admiralty\r\nsanction for proceeding with calculations in 1846, and I employed\r\ncomputers as was convenient. On July 20th of this year I was ready\r\nwith final results, and began to make enquiries about Fallows's\r\npersonal history, and the early history of the Cape Observatory. On\r\nOct. 23rd I applied for sanction for printing, which was given, and\r\nthe work was soon finished off, in the Astronomical Society's\r\nMemoirs.--In the month of March I had commenced correspondence with\r\nvarious persons on the imperfect state of publication of the British\r\nSurvey. Sheets of the Map were issued by scores, but not one of them\r\nhad an indication of latitude or longitude engraved. I knew that great\r\npains had been taken in giving to the principal triangulation a degree\r\nof accuracy never before reached, and in fixing the astronomical\r\nlatitudes of many stations with unequalled precision. Finally I\r\nprepared for the Council of the Royal Society a very strong\r\nrepresentation on these subjects, which was adopted and presented to\r\nthe Government. It was entirely successful, and the Maps were in\r\nfuture furnished with latitude and longitude lines.--I was elected\r\nPresident of the Royal Astronomical Society on Feb. 9th.--In June I\r\nwent with Sheepshanks to see some of the operation of measuring a Base\r\non Salisbury Plain. The following extract from a letter to his wife\r\ndated 1849, June 27th, relates to this expedition: 'In the morning we\r\nstarted before eight in an open carriage to the Plain: looking into\r\nOld Sarum on our way. The Base is measured on what I should think a\r\nmost unfavourable line, its north end (from which they have begun now,\r\nin verification of the old measure) being the very highest point in\r\nthe whole plain, called Beacon Hill. The soldiers measure only 252\r\nfeet in a day, so it will take them a good while to measure the whole\r\nseven miles. While we were there Col. Hall (Colby's successor) and\r\nYolland and Cosset came.'\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"I made short visits to Playford in January, April\r\nand July. From July 28th to Sept. 12th I made an expedition with my\r\nwife to Orkney and Shetland.--From Dec. 24th to 26th I was at\r\nHawkhurst, on a visit to Sir John Herschel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1850\r\n\r\n\"The Report to the Board of Visitors opens with the following\r\nparagraph: 'In recording the proceedings at the Royal Observatory\r\nduring the last year, I have less of novelty to communicate to the\r\nVisitors than in the Reports of several years past. Still I trust that\r\nthe present Report will not be uninteresting; as exhibiting, I hope, a\r\nsteady and vigorous adherence to a general plan long since matured,\r\naccompanied with a reasonable watchfulness for the introduction of new\r\ninstruments and new methods when they may seem desirable.'--Since the\r\nintroduction of the self-registering instruments a good many\r\nexperiments had been made to obtain the most suitable light, and the\r\nReport states that 'No change whatever has been made in these\r\ninstruments, except by the introduction of the light of coal-gas\r\ncharged with the vapour of coal-naptha, for photographic\r\nself-registration both of the magnetic and of the meteorological\r\ninstruments.... The chemical treatment of the paper is now so well\r\nunderstood by the Assistants that a failure is almost unknown. And,\r\ngenerally speaking, the photographs are most beautiful, and give\r\nconceptions of the continual disturbances in terrestrial magnetism\r\nwhich it would be impossible to acquire from eye-observation.'\r\n--Amongst the General Remarks of the Report it is stated\r\nthat 'There are two points which have distinctly engaged my\r\nattention. The first of these is, the introduction of the American\r\nmethod of observing transits, by completing a galvanic circuit by\r\nmeans of a touch of the finger at the instant of appulse of the\r\ntransiting body to the wire of the instrument, which circuit will then\r\nanimate a magnet that will make an impression upon a moving\r\npaper. After careful consideration of this method, I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that, in Prof. Mitchell's form, it does possess the advantages\r\nwhich have been ascribed to it, and that it may possess peculiar\r\nadvantages in this Observatory, where the time-connection of transits\r\nmade with two different instruments (the Transit and the Altazimuth)\r\nis of the highest importance.... The second point is, the connection\r\nof the Observatory with the galvanic telegraph of the South Eastern\r\nRailway, and with other lines of galvanic wire with which that\r\ntelegraph communicates. I had formerly in mind only the connection of\r\nthis Observatory with different parts of the great British island: but\r\nI now think it possible that our communications may be extended far\r\nbeyond its shores. The promoters of the submarine telegraph are very\r\nconfident of the practicability of completing a galvanic connection\r\nbetween England and France: and I now begin to think it more than\r\npossible that, within a few years, observations at Paris and Brussels\r\nmay be registered on the recording surfaces at Greenwich, and vice\r\nversa.'--Prof. Hansen was engaged in forming Lunar Tables from his\r\nLunar Theory, but was stopped for want of money. On Mar. 7th I\r\nrepresented this privately to Mr Baring, First Lord of the Admiralty;\r\nand on Mar. 30th I wrote officially to the Admiralty, soliciting\r\n_£150_ with the prospect, if necessary, of making it _£200_. On\r\nApr. 10th the Admiralty gave their assent. The existence of Hansen's\r\nLunar Tables is due to this grant.--The King of Denmark's Medal for\r\nComets was discontinued, owing to the difficulties produced by the\r\nhostility of Prussia.--On Aug. 1st I gave to the Treasury my opinion\r\non the first proposal for a large reflector in Australia: it was not\r\nstrongly favourable.--In August, being (with my wife and Otto Struve)\r\non a visit to Lady Breadalbane at Taymouth Castle, I examined the\r\nmountain Schehallien.--As in other years, I reported on several Papers\r\nfor the Royal Society, and took part in various business for them.--In\r\nthe Royal Astronomical Society I had much official business, as\r\nPresident.--In March I communicated to the Athenaeum my views on the\r\nExodus of the Israelites: this brought me into correspondence with\r\nMiss Corbaux, Robert Stephenson, Capt. Vetch, and Prof. J.D.\r\nForbes.--In December I went to the London Custom House, to\r\nsee Sir T. Freemantle (Chairman of Customs), and to see how far\r\ndecimal subdivisions were used in the Custom House.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"From Mar. 19th to 22nd I was on an expedition to\r\nFolkestone, Dover, Dungeness, &c.--From Apr. 3rd to 8th at Playford,\r\nand again for short periods in June and July.--From Aug. 1st to\r\nSept. 5th I was travelling in Scotland with my wife and Otto Struve\r\n(for part of the time). At Edinburgh I attended the Meeting of the\r\nBritish Association, and spoke a little in Section A. I was nominated\r\nPresident for 1851 at Ipswich. We travelled to Cape Wrath and returned\r\nby Inverness and the Caledonian Canal.--I was at Playford for a short\r\ntime in October and December.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1851\r\n\r\n\"In this year the great shed was built (first erected on the Magnetic\r\nGround, and about the year 1868 transferred to the South Ground).--The\r\nchronometers were taken from the old Chronometer Room (a room on the\r\nupper story fronting the south, now, 1872, called Library 2) and were\r\nput in the room above the Computing Room (where they remained for 10\r\nor 12 years, I think): it had a chronometer-oven with gas-heat,\r\nerected in 1850.--The following passage is quoted from the Report to\r\nthe Visitors:--'As regards Meridional Astronomy our equipment may now\r\nbe considered complete. As I have stated above, an improvement might\r\nyet be made in our Transit Circle; nevertheless I do not hesitate to\r\nexpress my belief that no other existing meridional instrument can be\r\ncompared with it. This presumed excellence has not been obtained\r\nwithout much thought on my part and much anxiety on the part of the\r\nconstructors of the instrument (Messrs Ransomes and May, and Mr\r\nSimms). But it would be very unjust to omit the further statement that\r\nthe expense of the construction has considerably exceeded the original\r\nestimate, and that this excess has been most liberally defrayed by the\r\nGovernment.'--In December Sir John Herschel gave his opinion (to the\r\nAdmiralty, I believe) in favour of procuring for the Cape Observatory\r\na Transit Circle similar to that at Greenwich.--I had much\r\ncorrespondence about sending Pierce Morton (formerly a pupil of mine\r\nat Cambridge, a clever gentlemanly man, and a high wrangler, but\r\nsomewhat flighty) as Magnetic Assistant to the Cape Observatory: he\r\nwas with me from May to October, and arrived at the Cape on\r\nNov. 27th.--I was much engaged with the clock with conical motion of\r\npendulum, for uniform movement of the Chronographic Barrel.--Regarding\r\ngalvanic communications: On Sept. 19th I had prepared a Draft of\r\nAgreement with the South Eastern Railway Company, to which they\r\nagreed. In November I wrote to Sir T. Baring (First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty) and to the Admiralty for sanction, which was given on\r\nDec. 18th. In December I had various communications about laying wires\r\nthrough the Park, &c., &c., and correspondence about the possibility\r\nof using sympathetic clocks: in June, apparently, I had seen\r\nShepherd's sympathetic clock at the Great Exhibition, and had seen the\r\nsystem of sympathetic clocks at Pawson's, St Paul's Churchyard.--In\r\nthe last quarter of this year I was engaged in a series of\r\ncalculations of chronological eclipses. On Sept. 30th Mr Bosanquet\r\nwrote to me about the Eclipse of Thales, and I urged on the\r\ncomputations related to it, through Mr Breen. In October the eclipse\r\nof Agathocles (the critical eclipse for the motion of the Moon's node)\r\nwas going on. In October Hansteen referred me to the darkness at\r\nStiklastad.--I went to Sweden to observe the total eclipse of July\r\n28th, having received assistance from the Admiralty for the journeys\r\nof myself, Mr Dunkin, Mr Humphreys and his friend, and Capt.\r\nBlackwood. I had prepared a map of its track, in which an\r\nimportant error of the _Berliner Jahrbuch_ (arising from neglect of\r\nthe earth's oblateness) was corrected. I gave a lecture at the Royal\r\nInstitution, in preparation for the eclipse, and drew up suggestions\r\nfor observations, and I prepared a scheme of observations for\r\nGreenwich, but the weather was bad. The official account of the\r\nObservations of the Eclipse, with diagrams and conclusions, is given\r\nin full in a paper published in the Royal Astr. Society's\r\nMemoirs.--This year I was President of the British Association, at the\r\nIpswich Meeting: it necessarily produced a great deal of business. I\r\nlectured one evening on the coming eclipse. Prince Albert was present,\r\nas guest of Sir William Middleton: I was engaged to meet him at\r\ndinner, but when I found that the dinner day was one of the principal\r\nsoirée days, I broke off the engagement.--On May 26th I had the first\r\nletter from E. Hamilton (whom I had known at Cambridge) regarding the\r\nselection of professors for the University of Sydney. Herschel,\r\nMaldon, and H. Denison were named as my coadjutors. Plenty of work\r\nwas done, but it was not finished till 1852.--In connection with the\r\nclock for Westminster Palace, in February there were considerations\r\nabout providing other clocks for the various buildings; and this\r\nprobably was one reason for my examining Shepherd's Clocks at the\r\nGreat Exhibition and at Pawson's. In November I first proposed that\r\nMr E.B. Denison should be associated with me. About the end of the\r\nyear, the plan of the tower was supplied to me, with reference to the\r\nsuspension of the weights and other particulars.--In 1850 Admiral\r\nDundas (M.P. for Greenwich and one of the Board of Admiralty) had\r\nrequested me to aid the Trustees of the Dee Navigation against an\r\nattack; and on Mar. 19th 1851 I went to Chester to see the state of\r\nthe river. On Jan. 1st 1852 I went to give evidence at the Official\r\nEnquiry.--At a discussion on the construction of the Great Exhibition\r\nbuilding in the Institution of Civil Engineers, I expressed myself\r\nstrongly on the faulty principles of its construction.--In this year I\r\nwrote my first Paper on the landing of Julius Caesar in Britain, and\r\nwas engaged in investigations of the geography, tides, sands, &c.,\r\nrelating to the subject.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"I was several times at Playford during January,\r\nand went there again on Dec. 23rd.--In this year a very heavy\r\nmisfortune fell on us. My daughter, Elizabeth, had been on a visit to\r\nLady Herschel at Hawkhurst, and on Apr. 2nd Sir J. Herschel wrote to\r\nme, saying that she was so well in health. She returned a few days\r\nlater, and from her appearance I was sure that she was suffering under\r\ndeadly disease. After some time, an able physician was consulted, who\r\nat once pronounced it to be pulmonary. A sea voyage was thought\r\ndesirable, and my wife took her to Shetland, where there was again a\r\nkind welcome from Mr Edmonston. But this, and the care taken on her\r\nreturn, availed nothing: and it was determined to take her to\r\nMadeira. My wife and daughter sailed in the brig 'Eclipse' from\r\nSouthampton on Dec. 11th. The termination came in 1852.--On Nov. 23rd\r\nI went to Bradfield, near Bury: my uncle, George Biddell, died, and I\r\nattended the funeral on Nov. 29th.--From July 18th to Aug. 24th I was\r\nin Sweden for the Observation of the Eclipse, and returned through\r\nHolland.--In October I was about a week at Ventnor and Torquay, and\r\nfrom Dec. 7th to 11th at Southampton, on matters connected with my\r\ndaughter's illness.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from letters to his wife, relating to the\r\nObservation of the eclipse, his interview with the King of Sweden,\r\n&c., and his visit to the pumping engines at Haarlem:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   _July 28, half-past 10, morning_.\r\n\r\nThe weather is at present most perfectly doubtful. Nearly the whole\r\nsky is closely covered, yet there is now and then a momentary gleam of\r\nsun. The chances are greatly against much of the eclipse being\r\nseen. All is arranged to carry off the telescope, &c., at 11: they can\r\nbe carted to the foot of the hill, and we have made out a walking-pass\r\nthen to the top. We are to dine with Mr Dickson afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             _July 28, 10 at night_.\r\n\r\nWell we have had a glorious day. As soon as we started, the weather\r\nbegan to look better. We went up the hill and planted my telescope,\r\nand the sky shewed a large proportion of blue. At first I placed the\r\ntelescope on the highest rock, but the wind blew almost a gale, and\r\nshook it slightly: so I descended about 8 feet to one side. (The power\r\nof doing this was one of the elements in my choice of this station,\r\nwhich made me prefer it to the high hill beyond the river.) The view\r\nof scenery was inexpressibly beautiful. The beginning of eclipse was\r\nwell seen. The sky gradually thickened from that time, so that the sun\r\nwas in whitish cloud at the totality, and barely visible in dense\r\ncloud at the end of the eclipse. The progress of the eclipse brought\r\non the wonderful changes that you know: just before the totality I saw\r\na large piece of blue sky become pitch black; the horror of totality\r\nwas very great; and then flashed into existence (I do not know how) a\r\nbroad irregular corona with red flames _instantly seen_ of the most\r\nfantastic kind. The darkness was such that my assistant had very great\r\ntrouble in reading his box chronometer. (A free-hand explanatory\r\ndiagram is here given.)  Some important points are made out from\r\nthis. 1st the red flames certainly belong to the sun. 2nd they\r\ncertainly are in some instances detached. 3rd they are sometimes quite\r\ncrooked. 4th they seem to be connected with spots. The corona was\r\nbrilliant white. One star brilliant: I believe Venus. I had no time to\r\nmake observations of polarization, &c., although prepared. When the\r\ntotality was more than half over I looked to N. and N.W., and in these\r\nregions there was the fullest rosy day-break light. After the\r\nsun-light reappeared, the black shadow went travelling away to the\r\nS.E. exactly like the thunder-storm from the Main. The day then grew\r\nworse, and we came home here (after dinner) in pouring rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            STOCKHOLM,\r\n                                                     _1851, Aug. 5_.\r\n\r\nI then by appointment with Sir Edmund Lyons went with him to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Baron Stjerneld, who received me most\r\ncivilly. My business was to thank him for the orders which had been\r\ngiven to facilitate the landing of our telescopes, &c., &c. He was\r\nquite familiar with the names of my party, Humphreys Milaud, &c., so\r\nthat I trust they have been well received (I have had no letter). He\r\nintimated, I suppose at Sir E. Lyons's suggestion, that perhaps King\r\nOscar might wish to see me, but that it would not be on Tuesday. So I\r\nreplied that I was infinitely flattered and he said that he would send\r\na message to Sir E. Lyons by Tuesday evening. Now all this put me in a\r\nquandary: because I wanted to see Upsala, 47 miles off: and the\r\nsteamboats on the Mälar only go in the morning and return in the\r\nmorning: and this was irreconcileable with waiting for his Majesty's\r\nappointment which might be for Wednesday morning. So after\r\nconsultation Sir E. Lyons put me in the hands of a sort of courier\r\nattached to the Embassy, and he procured a calèche, and I posted to\r\nUpsala yesterday afternoon (knocking the people up at 11 at night) and\r\nposted back this afternoon. And sure enough a message has come that\r\nthe king expects me at 11 to-morrow morning. Posting of course is much\r\ndearer than steam-boat travelling, but it is cheap in comparison with\r\nEngland: two horses cost 1s. for nearly 7 miles. At Upsala there is a\r\nvery good old cathedral, I suppose the only one in Sweden: and many\r\nthings about the University which interested me. I sent my card to\r\nProfessor Fries, and he entirely devoted himself to me: but imagine\r\nour conversation--he spoke in _Latin_ and I in French: however we\r\nunderstood each other very well. It is on the whole a dreary country\r\nexcept where enlivened by lakes: some parts are pine forests and birch\r\nforests, but others are featureless ground with boulder stones, like\r\nthe worst part of the Highlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   _August 6, Wednesday, 3 o'clock_.\r\n\r\nI rigged myself in black trowsers and white waistcoat and neckcloth\r\nthis morning. Sir Edmund Lyons called. Baron Wrede called on me: he\r\nhad observed the Eclipse at Calmar and brought his drawing, much like\r\nmine. He conducted me to the Palace. The Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\ncame to me. In the waiting-room I was introduced to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Christianstad, who had had the charge of\r\nHumphreys and Milaud. He had placed a _guard of soldiers_ round them\r\nwhile they were observing. They saw the eclipse well. Captain\r\nBlackwood went to Helsingborg instead of Bornholm, and saw well. I am\r\nsorry to hear that it was cloudy at Christiania, Mr Dunkin's\r\nstation. I heard some days ago that Hind had lost his telescope, but I\r\nnow heard a very different story: that he landed at Ystad, and found a\r\nvery bad hotel there: that he learnt from Murray that the hotels at\r\nCarlscrona (or wherever he meant to go) were much worse; and so he\r\ngrew faint at heart and turned back. I was summoned in to the King\r\nand presented by the Minister (Stjerneld), and had a long conversation\r\nwith him: on the eclipse, the arc of meridian, the languages, and the\r\nUniversities. We spoke in French. Then Baron Wrede went with me to the\r\nRittershus (House of Lords or Nobles) in Session, and to the Gallery\r\nof Scandinavian Antiquities, which is very remarkable: the collection\r\nof stone axes and chisels, bronze do., iron do., ornaments, &c. is\r\nquite amazing. I was struck with seeing specimens from a very distant\r\nage of the Maid of Norway's brooch: the use of which I explained to\r\nthe Director.\r\n\r\nI dined and drove out with Sir E. Lyons, and called at the houses of\r\nthe Baron Stjerneld and of the Norwegian Minister Baron Duë, and had\r\ntea at the latter. Most of these people speak English well, and they\r\nseem to live in a very domestic family style. I should soon be quite\r\nat home here: for I perceive that my reception at Court, &c., make\r\npeople think that I am a very proper sort of person.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe extract concerning his visit to the Pumping-Engines at Haarlem is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               LEYDEN,\r\n                                       _1851, August 20, Wednesday_.\r\n\r\nI went to see the great North Holland Canal, and went a mile or two in\r\na horse-drawn-boat upon it: a very comfortable conveyance. Saw\r\nwindmills used for sawing timber and other purposes, as well as some\r\nfor grinding and many for draining. Yesterday at half-past one I went\r\nby railway to Haarlem. I did not look at anything in the town except\r\ngoing through it and seeing that it is a curious fantastic place, but\r\nI drove at once to the burgomaster to ask permission to visit one of\r\nthe three great pumping engines for draining the immense Haarlem lake,\r\nand then drove to it. Imagine a round tower with a steam-cylinder in\r\nits center; and the piston which works up-and-down, instead of working\r\none great beam as they usually do, works _eight_, poking out on\r\ndifferent sides of the round tower, and each driving a pump 6 feet in\r\ndiameter. I am glad to have seen it. Then by railway here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1852\r\n\r\n\"Galvanic communication was now established with Lewisham station\r\n(thus giving power of communicating with London, Deal, &c.).--From the\r\nReport to the Board of Visitors it appears that, in the case of the\r\nTransit Circle, the azimuth of the Instrument as determined by\r\nopposite passages of the Pole Star had varied four seconds; and in the\r\ncase of the Altazimuth, there was a discordance in the azimuthal zeros\r\nof the Instrument, as determined from observations of stars. In both\r\ncases it was concluded that the discordances arose from small\r\nmovements of the ground.--Under the head of 'General Remarks' in the\r\nReport, the following paragraph occurs: 'It will be perceived that the\r\nnumber of equatoreal observations made here at present is small: and\r\nthat they are rarely directed to new comets and similar objects which\r\nsometimes excite considerable interest. This omission is\r\nintentional. It is not because the instrumental means are wanting (for\r\nour Equatoreals, though not comparable to those of either Cambridge,\r\nor of Pulkowa, are fully equal to those usually directed to such\r\nobjects), but it is because these observations are most abundantly\r\nsupplied from other observatories, public and private, and because the\r\ngain to those observations from our taking a part in them would,\r\nprobably, be far less than the loss to the important class of\r\nobservations which we can otherwise follow so well. Moreover, I am\r\nunwilling to take any step which could be interpreted as attempting to\r\ndeprive the local and private observatories of honours which they have\r\nso nobly earned. And, finally, in this act of abstinence, I am\r\ndesirous of giving an example of adhesion to one principle which, I am\r\nconfident, might be extensively followed with great advantage to\r\nastronomy:--the principle of division of labour.'--Discoveries of\r\nsmall planets were now not infrequent: but the only one of interest to\r\nme is Melpomene, for the following reason. On 1852 June 24 I lost my\r\nmost dear, amiable, clever daughter Elizabeth: she died at\r\nSouthampton, two days after landing from Madeira. On that evening Mr\r\nHind discovered the planet; and he requested me to give a name. I\r\nremembered Horace's 'Praecipe lugubres cantus, Melpomene,' and\r\nCowley's 'I called the buskin'd muse Melpomene and told her what sad\r\nstory I would write,' and suggested Melpomene, or Penthos: Melpomene\r\nwas adopted.--The first move about the Deal Time Ball was in a letter\r\nfrom Commander Baldock to the Admiralty, suggesting that a Time Ball,\r\ndropped by galvanic current from Greenwich, should be attached to one\r\nof the South Foreland Lighthouses. The Admiralty sent this for my\r\nReport. I went to the place, and I suggested in reply (Nov. 15th) that\r\na better place would be at an old signal station on the chalk\r\ndowns. The decisive change from this was made in 1853.--As the result\r\nof my examination and enquiries into the subject of sympathetic\r\nclocks, I established 8 sympathetic clocks in the Royal Observatory,\r\none of which outside the entrance gate had a large dial with\r\nShepherd's name as Patentee. Exception was taken to this by the\r\nsolicitor of a Mr Bain who had busied himself about galvanic\r\nclocks. After much correspondence I agreed to remove Shepherd's name\r\ntill Bain had legally established his claim. This however was never\r\ndone: and in 1853 Shepherd's name was restored.--In Nov. 1851,\r\nDenison had consented to join me in the preparation of the Westminster\r\nClock. In Feb. 1852 we began to have little disagreements. However on\r\nApr. 6th I was going to Madeira, and requested him to act with full\r\npowers from me.--I communicated to the Royal Society my Paper on the\r\nEclipses of Agathocles, Thales, and Xerxes.--In the British\r\nAssociation, I had presided at the Ipswich Meeting in 1851, and\r\naccording to custom I ought to attend at the 1852 Meeting (held at\r\nBelfast) to resign my office. But I was broken in spirit by the death\r\nof my daughter, and the thing generally was beyond my willing\r\nenterprise. I requested Sir Roderick Murchison to act generally for\r\nme: which he did, as I understood, very gracefully.--In this year a\r\nproposal was made by the Government for shifting all the Meeting Rooms\r\nof the Scientific Societies to Kensington Gore, which was stoutly\r\nresisted by all, and was finally abandoned.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"I was at Playford in January, and went thence to\r\nChester on the enquiry about the tides of the Dee; and made excursions\r\nto Halton Castle and to Holyhead.--From Apr. 8th to May 14th I was on\r\nthe voyage to and from Madeira, and on a short visit to my wife and\r\ndaughter there.--On June 23rd I went to Southampton to meet my wife\r\nand daughter just landed from Madeira: on June 24th my dear daughter\r\nElizabeth died: she was buried at Playford on June 29th.--I was at\r\nPlayford also in July and December.--From Sept. 16th to 24th I went to\r\nCumberland, viâ Fleetwood and Peel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1853\r\n\r\n\"On May 3rd 1853 I issued an address to the individual Members of the\r\nBoard of Visitors, proposing the extension of the Lunar Reductions\r\nfrom 1830. From this it appears that 'Through the whole period (from\r\n1830 to 1853), the places of the Moon, deduced from the observations,\r\nare compared with the places computed in the Nautical Almanac: that\r\nis, with Burckhardt's tables, which have been used for many years in\r\ncomputing the places of the Nautical Almanac.......Very lately,\r\nhowever, Mr Adams has shewn that Burckhardt's Parallax is erroneous in\r\nformula and is numerically incorrect, sometimes to the amount of seven\r\nseconds. In consequence of this, every reduction of the Observations\r\nof the Moon, from 1830 to the present time, is sensibly erroneous. And\r\nthe error is of such a nature that it is not easy, in general, to\r\nintroduce its correction by any simple process.... The number of\r\nobservations to the end of 1851 (after which time the parallax will be\r\ncorrected in the current reductions) is about 2560. An expense\r\napproaching to _£400_ might be incurred in their reduction.'\r\nSubsequently I made application to the Admiralty, and the _£400_ was\r\ngranted on Dec. 12th.--In the Report to the Visitors it is stated that\r\nwith regard to the Transit Circle, changes are under contemplation in\r\nits reflection-apparatus: one of these changes relates to the material\r\nof the trough. 'Several years ago, when I was at Hamburgh, my revered\r\nfriend Prof. Schumacher exhibited to me the pacifying effect of a\r\ncopper dish whose surface had been previously amalgamated with\r\nquicksilver.......The Rev. Charles Pritchard has lately given much\r\nattention to this curious property of the metals, and has brought the\r\npractical operation of amalgamation to great perfection. Still it is\r\nnot without difficulty, on account of a singular crystallization of\r\nthe amalgam.'--With regard to the Chronograph, the Report states: 'The\r\nBarrel Apparatus for the American method of observing transits is not\r\nyet brought into use.... I have, however, brought it to such a state\r\nthat I am beginning to try whether the Barrel moves with sufficient\r\nuniformity to be itself used as the Transit Clock. This, if perfectly\r\nsecured, would be a very great convenience, but I am not very sanguine\r\non that point.'--A change had been made in the Electrometer-apparatus:\r\n'A wire for the collection of atmospheric electricity is now stretched\r\nfrom a chimney on the north-west angle of the leads of the Octagon\r\nRoom to the Electrometer pole.... There appears to be no doubt that a\r\ngreater amount of electricity is collected by this apparatus than by\r\nthat formerly in use.'--As regards the Magnetical Observations: 'The\r\nVisitors at their last Meeting, expressed a wish that some attempt\r\nshould be made to proceed further in the reduction or digest of the\r\nmagnetical results, if any satisfactory plan could be devised. I\r\ncannot say that I have yet satisfied myself on the propriety of any\r\nspecial plan that I have examined.... I must, however, confess that,\r\nin viewing the capricious forms of the photographic curves, my mind is\r\nentirely bewildered, and I sometimes doubt the possibility of\r\nextracting from them anything whatever which can be considered\r\ntrustworthy.'--Great progress had been made with the distribution of\r\ntime. 'The same Normal Clock maintains in sympathetic movement the\r\nlarge clock at the entrance gate, two other clocks in the Observatory,\r\nand a clock at the London Bridge Terminus of the South-Eastern\r\nRailway.... It sends galvanic signals every day along all the\r\nprincipal railways diverging from London. It drops the Greenwich Ball,\r\nand the Ball on the Offices of the Electric Telegraph Company in the\r\nStrand;... All these various effects are produced without sensible\r\nerror of time; and I cannot but feel a satisfaction in thinking that\r\nthe Royal Observatory is thus quietly contributing to the punctuality\r\nof business through a large portion of this busy country. I have the\r\nsatisfaction of stating to the Visitors that the Lords Commissioners\r\nof the Admiralty have decided on the erection of a Time-Signal Ball at\r\nDeal, for the use of the shipping in the Downs, to be dropped every\r\nday by a galvanic current from the Royal Observatory. The construction\r\nof the apparatus is entrusted to me. Probably there is no roadstead in\r\nthe world in which the knowledge of true time is so important.'--The\r\nReport includes an account of the determination of the Longitude of\r\nCambridge Observatory by means of galvanic signals, which appear to\r\nhave been perfectly successful.--Under the head of General Remarks the\r\nfollowing passage appears: 'The system of combining the labour of\r\nunattached computers with that of attached Assistants tends materially\r\nto strengthen our powers in everything relating to computation. We\r\nfind also, among the young persons who are engaged merely to serve as\r\ncomputers, a most laudable ambition to distinguish themselves as\r\nobservers; and thus we are always prepared to undertake any\r\nobservations which may be required, although necessarily by an\r\nexpenditure of strength which would usually be employed on some other\r\nwork.'--Considerable work was undertaken in preparing a new set of\r\nmaps of our buildings and grounds.--On Apr. 23rd there was a small\r\nfire in the magnetic observatory, which did little mischief.--In\r\nDecember I wrote my description of the Transit Circle.--Lieut.\r\nStratford, the Editor of the Nautical Almanac, died, and\r\nthere was some competition for the office. I was willing to take\r\nit at a low rate, for the addition to my salary: Mr Main--and I think\r\nMr Glaisher--were desirous of exchanging to it: Prof. Adams was\r\nanxious for it. The Admiralty made the excellent choice of Mr\r\nHind.--In October Faraday and I, at Lothbury, witnessed some\r\nremarkable experiments by Mr Latimer Clark on a galvanic current\r\ncarried four times to and from Manchester by subterranean wires (more\r\nthan 2000 miles) shewing the retardation of visible currents (at their\r\nmaximum effect) and the concentration of active power. I made\r\ninvestigations of the velocity of the Galvanic Current.--I was engaged\r\non the preliminary enquiries and arrangements for the Deal Time\r\nBall.--With respect to the Westminster Clock; an angry paper was\r\nissued by Mr Vulliamy. In October I expostulated with Denison about\r\nhis conduct towards Sir Charles Barry: on November 7th I resigned.--On\r\nFeb. 11th I was elected President of the Royal Astronomical\r\nSociety.--In the Royal Institution I lectured on the Ancient\r\nEclipses.--On Dec. 15th I was elected to the Academy of\r\nBrussels.--After preliminary correspondence with Sir W. Molesworth\r\n(First Commissioner of Works, &c.) and Sir Charles Barry (Architect of\r\nthe Westminster Palace), I wrote, on May 14th, to Mr Gladstone about\r\ndepositing the four Parliamentary Copies of Standards, at the Royal\r\nObservatory, the Royal Mint, the Royal Society, and within a wall of\r\nWestminster Palace. Mr Gladstone assented on June 23rd.--On Mar. 26th\r\nI wrote to Mr Gladstone, proposing to take advantage of the new copper\r\ncoinage for introducing the decimal system. I was always strenuous\r\nabout preserving the Pound Sterling. On May 10th I attended the\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons on decimal coinage: and in May and\r\nSeptember I wrote letters to the Athenaeum on decimal coinage.--I had\r\nalways something on hand about Tides. A special subject now was, the\r\ncry about intercepting the tidal waters of the Tyne by the formation\r\nof the Jarrow Docks, in Jarrow Slake; which fear I considered to be\r\nridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"From Jan. 15th to 24th I was at Playford.--On\r\nMar. 4th I went to Dover to try time-signals.--From June 24th to\r\nAug. 6th I was at Little Braithwaite near Keswick, where I had hired a\r\nhouse, and made expeditions with members of my family in all\r\ndirections. On July 28th I went, with my son Wilfrid, by Workington\r\nand Maryport to Rose Castle, the residence of Bishop Percy (the Bishop\r\nof Carlisle), and on to Carlisle and Newcastle, looking at various\r\nworks, mines, &c.--On Dec. 24th I went to Playford.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1854\r\n\r\nThe chronograph Barrel-Apparatus for the American method of transits\r\nhad been practically brought into use: \"I have only to add that this\r\napparatus is now generally efficient. It is troublesome in use;\r\nconsuming much time in the galvanic preparations, the preparation of\r\nthe paper, and the translation of the puncture-indications into\r\nfigures. But among the observers who use it there is but one opinion\r\non its astronomical merits--that, in freedom from personal equation\r\nand in general accuracy, it is very far superior to the observations\r\nby eye and ear.\"--The printing and publication of the Observations,\r\nwhich was always regarded by Airy as a matter of the first importance,\r\nhad fallen into arrear: \"I stated in my last Report that the printing\r\nof the Observations for 1852 was scarcely commenced at the time of the\r\nlast meeting of the Visitors. For a long time the printing went on so\r\nslowly that I almost despaired of ever again seeing the Observations\r\nin a creditable state. After a most harassing correspondence, the\r\nprinters were at length persuaded to move more actively, ... but the\r\nvolume is still very much behind its usual time of publication.\"--\"The\r\nDeal Time-Ball has now been erected by Messrs Maudslays and Field, and\r\nis an admirable specimen of the workmanship of those celebrated\r\nengineers. The galvanic connection with the Royal Observatory (through\r\nthe telegraph wires of the South Eastern Railway) is perfect. The\r\nautomatic changes of wire-communications are so arranged that, when\r\nthe Ball at Deal has dropped to its lowest point, it sends a message\r\nto Greenwich to acquaint me, not with the time of the beginning of its\r\nfall (which cannot be in error) but with the fact that it has really\r\nfallen. The Ball has several times been dropped experimentally with\r\nperfect success; and some small official and subsidiary arrangements\r\nalone are wanting for bringing it into constant use.\"--The operations\r\nfor the galvanic determination of the longitude of Brussels are\r\ndescribed, with the following conclusion: \"Thus, about 3000 effective\r\nsignals were made, but only 1000 of these were admissible for the\r\nfundamental objects of the operation. The result, I need scarcely\r\nremark, claims a degree of accuracy to which no preceding\r\ndetermination of longitude could ever pretend. I apprehend that the\r\nprobable error in the difference of time corresponds to not more than\r\none or two yards upon the Earth's surface.--A careful scheme had been\r\narranged for the determination of the longitude of Lerwick, but\r\n'unfortunately, the demand for chronometers caused by our large naval\r\narmament has been so considerable that I cannot reckon on having at my\r\ndisposal a sufficient number to carry on this operation successfully;\r\nand I have, therefore, unwillingly deferred it to a more peaceful\r\ntime.'--The covering stone of Halley's Tomb in Lee Churchyard was much\r\nshattered, and I applied to the Admiralty for funds for its complete\r\nrestoration: these were granted on Feb. 3rd.--In this year, under my\r\ncognizance, _£100_ was added to the Hansen grant.--I had much\r\ncorrespondence and work in connection with the printing of Maclear's\r\nwork at the Cape of Good Hope. In June, all accounts, &c. about the\r\nTransit Circle were closed at the Admiralty, and the instrument was\r\ncompletely mounted at the Cape.--Dr Scoresby (who in his own way was\r\nvery imperious) had attacked my methods of correcting the compass in\r\niron ships: I replied in a letter to the Athenaeum on Oct. 17th.--I\r\nmade enquiries about operations for determining the longitude of\r\nVienna, but was utterly repelled by the foreign telegraph offices.--In\r\nthe Royal Astronomical Society; I prepared the Address on presenting\r\nthe Medal to Rümker.--In Melbourne University: The first letter\r\nreceived was from the Chancellor of the University dated Jan. 26th,\r\nrequesting that Sir John Herschel, Prof. Malden, Mr Lowe\r\n(subsequently Chancellor of the Exchequer), and I would select\r\nprofessors. We had a great deal of correspondence, meetings,\r\nexamination of testimonials, &c., and on August 14th we agreed on\r\nWilson, Rowe, McCoy, and Hearn.--On Feb. 17th I received the Prussian\r\nOrder of Merit.--I had correspondence with the Treasury on the scale\r\nto be adopted for the Maps of the British Survey. I proposed 1/3000,\r\nand for some purposes 1/600.--I printed a Paper on the Deluge, in\r\nwhich I shewed (I believe to certainty) that the Deluge of Genesis was\r\nmerely a Destructive Flood of the Nile.--Being well acquainted with\r\nthe mountains of Cumberland, I had remarked that a 'man' or cairn of\r\nstones erected by the Ordnance Surveyors on the Great Gable had\r\ncovered up a curious natural stone trough, known as one of the\r\nremarkable singularities of the country. This year, without giving any\r\nnotice to the Ordnance Surveyors, I sent two wallers from Borrowdale\r\nto the mountain top, to remove the 'man' about 10 feet and expose the\r\ntrough. Sir Henry James afterwards approved of my act, and refunded\r\nthe expense.--I investigated the optical condition of an eye with\r\nconical cornea.\r\n\r\n\"The Harton Colliery Experiment: I had long wished to repeat the\r\nexperiment which I had attempted unsuccessfully in 1826 and 1828, of\r\ndetermining by pendulum-vibrations the measure of gravity at the\r\nbottom of a mine. Residing near Keswick this summer, and having the\r\nmatter in my mind, I availed myself of an introduction from Dr Leitch\r\nto some gentlemen at South Shields, for inspection of the Harton\r\nColliery. I judged that it would answer pretty well. I find that on\r\nAug. 11th I wrote to Mr Anderson (lessee of the mine), and on the same\r\nday to the Admiralty requesting authority to employ a Greenwich\r\nAssistant, and requesting _£100_ for part payment of expenses. On\r\nAugust 16th the Admiralty assent. There were many preparations to be\r\nmade, both personal and instrumental. My party consisted of Dunkin\r\n(Superintendant), Ellis, Criswick, Simmons, Pogson, and Rümker: I did\r\nnot myself attend the detail of observations. The observations began\r\non Oct. 2nd and ended on Oct. 21st: supplementary observations were\r\nsubsequently made at Greenwich for examining the coefficient of\r\ntemperature-correction. On Oct. 24th I gave a Lecture at South Shields\r\non the whole operation. In 'Punch' of Nov. 18th there was an excellent\r\nsemi-comic account of the experiment, which as I afterwards found was\r\nwritten by Mr Percival Leigh.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"On Jan. 18th I returned from Playford. From\r\nMar. 10th to 13th I was at Deal, and visited Sir John Herschel at\r\nHawkhurst.--From June 28th to Aug. 7th I was staying with my family at\r\nThe Grange, in Borrowdale near Keswick: and also made an expedition to\r\nPenrith, Carlisle, Newcastle, Jarrow, &c.; and descended the Harton\r\nPit.--In September and also in October I was at South Shields on the\r\nHarton Experiments.--From Dec. 14th to 18th I was at Cambridge, and on\r\nthe 26th I went to Playford.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter, written in answer to a lady who had asked him to\r\nprocure permission from Lord Rosse for her to observe with his\r\ntelescope, is characteristic:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH.\r\n                                               _1854, September 20_.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\nThe state of things with regard to Lord Rosse's Telescope is this. If\r\na night is fine, it is wanted for his use or for the use of\r\nprofessional astronomers. If it is not fine, it is of no use to\r\nanybody. Now considering this, and considering that the appropriation\r\nof the telescope on a fine night to any body but a technical\r\nastronomer is a misapplication of an enormous capital of money and\r\nintellect which is invested in this unique instrument--it is against\r\nmy conscience to ask Lord Rosse to place it at the service of any\r\nperson except an experienced astronomer. No introduction, I believe,\r\nis necessary for seeing it in the day-time. The instrument stands\r\nunenclosed in the Castle Demesne, to which strangers are admitted\r\nwithout question, I believe...............\r\n\r\n        Faithfully yours,\r\n          G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1855\r\n\r\n\"On May 9th it was notified to me (I think through the Hydrographer)\r\nthat the Admiralty were not unwilling to increase my salary. I made\r\napplication therefore; and on Jan. 21st 1856 Sir Charles Wood notified\r\nto me that the Admiralty consented to have it raised from _£800_ to\r\n_£1000_.--In the Report to the Board of Visitors it appears that 'At\r\nthe instance of the Board of Trade, acting on this occasion through a\r\nCommittee of the Royal Society, a model of the Transit Circle (with\r\nthe improvement of perforated cube, &c. introduced in the Cape\r\nTransit Circle) has been prepared for the Great Exhibition at\r\nParis.'--Under the head of Reduction of Astronomical Observations it\r\nis stated that 'During the whole time of which I have spoken, the\r\ngalvanic-contact method has been employed for transits, with the\r\nexception of a few days, when the galvanic apparatus was out of order.\r\nFrom the clock errors, I have deduced the personal equations of the\r\nobservers in our usual way.... The result is that the magnitude of the\r\npersonal equations in the galvanic-touch method is not above half of\r\nthat in the eye and ear method.'--With regard to the Reduction of the\r\nMagnetical Observations, 'I have not yet felt sufficiently satisfied\r\nwith any proposed method of discussing the magnetic results to devote\r\nany time to their further treatment.'--'The Time-Signal Ball at Deal\r\nwas brought into regular use at the beginning of the present year. In\r\na short time, however, its action was interrupted, partly by\r\nderangement of the apparatus, and partly by the severity of the\r\nweather, which froze the sulphuric acid to the state of jelly. I sent\r\nan assistant and workman to put it in order, and since that time it\r\nhas generally acted very well.--Application has been made to me from\r\none of the important offices of Government (the Post Office) for the\r\ngalvanic regulation of their clocks.--On considering the risks to\r\nwhich various galvanic communications are liable, and the financial\r\nnecessity for occupying wires as little as possible, I perceived that\r\nit was necessary to devise constructions which should satisfy the\r\nfollowing conditions. First, that a current sent once a day should\r\nsuffice for adjusting the clock, even if it had gone ten or more\r\nseconds wrong. Secondly, that an occasional failure of the current\r\nshould not stop the clock. I have arranged constructions which possess\r\nthese characters, and the artist (Mr C. Shepherd) is now engaged in\r\npreparing estimates of the expense. I think it likely that this may\r\nprove to be the beginning of a very extensive system of clock\r\nregulation.\"--With respect to the operations for determining the\r\nlongitude of Paris, it is stated that, \"The whole number of days of\r\nsignal transmission was eighteen, and the whole number of signals\r\ntransmitted was 2530. The number of days considered available for\r\nlongitude, in consequence of transits of stars having been observed at\r\nboth Observatories, was twelve, and the number of signals was\r\n1703. Very great care was taken on both sides, for the adjustments of\r\nthe instruments. The resulting difference of longitude, 9m. 20.63s.,\r\nis probably very accurate. It is less by nearly 1s. of time than that\r\ndetermined in 1825 by rocket-signals, under the superintendance of Sir\r\nJohn Herschel and Col. Sabine. The time occupied by the passage of the\r\ngalvanic current appears to be 1/12th of a second.\"--With regard to\r\nthe Pendulum Experiments in the Harton Colliery, after mentioning that\r\npersonal assistance had been sought and obtained from the\r\nObservatories of Cambridge, Oxford, Durham, and Red Hill, the Report\r\nstates that \"The experiments appear to have been in every point\r\nsuccessful, shewing beyond doubt that gravity is increased at the\r\ndepth of 1260 feet by 1/10000th part. I trust that this combination\r\nmay prove a valuable precedent for future associations of the\r\ndifferent Observatories of the kingdom, when objects requiring\r\nextensive personal organization shall present themselves.\"--On\r\nOct. 18th the Astronomer Royal printed an Address to the Individual\r\nMembers of the Board of Visitors on the subject of a large new\r\nEquatoreal for the Observatory. After a brief statement of the\r\nexisting equipment of the Observatory in respect of equatoreal\r\ninstruments, the Address continues thus: \"It is known to the Visitors\r\nthat I have uniformly objected to any luxury of extrameridional\r\napparatus, which would materially divert us from a steady adherence to\r\nthe meridional system which both reason and tradition have engrafted\r\non this Observatory. But I feel that our present instruments are\r\ninsufficient even for my wishes; and I cannot overlook the\r\nconsideration that due provision must be made for future interests,\r\nand that we are nearer by twenty years to the time when another\r\njudgment must decide on the direction which shall be given to the\r\nforce of the Observatory.\"--\"In August I had some correspondence about\r\nthe Egyptian wooden astronomical tablets with Mr Gresswell and others:\r\nthey were fully examined by Mr Ellis.--In this year I was much engaged\r\non schemes for compasses, and in June I sent my Paper on Discussions\r\nof Ships' Magnetism to the Royal Society.--On Dec. 6th the mast of the\r\nObservatory time-ball broke, and the Ball fell in the Front Court.--On\r\nAug. 4th my valued friend Mr Sheepshanks died; and on Aug. 14th I went\r\nto London to see the Standard Bars as left by him. Afterwards, on\r\nOct. 25th I went to Reading to collect the papers about Standards left\r\nby Mr Sheepshanks.--I made a mechanical construction for Euclid I. 47,\r\nwith which I was well satisfied.--On Apr. 13th I joined a deputation\r\nto the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir G. Cornewall Lewis) on Decimal\r\nCoinage.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"I was at Playford for a large part of\r\nJanuary.--On Mar, 26th I went to Reading, to visit Mr Sheepshanks, and\r\nafterwards to Silchester and Hereford.--On June 21st I went with my\r\nwife and two eldest sons to Edinburgh and other places in Scotland,\r\nbut residing principally at Oban, where I hired a house. Amongst other\r\nexpeditions, I and my son Wilfrid went with the 'Pharos' (Northern\r\nLights Steamer) to the Skerry Vohr Lighthouse, &c. I also visited\r\nNewcastle, &c., and returned to Greenwich on Aug. 2nd.--From Oct. 12th\r\nto 17th I was at Cambridge.--On Dec. 24th I went to Playford.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n               AT GREENWICH OBSERVATORY--1856 TO 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1856\r\n\r\n\"In the Report to the Visitors there is an interesting account of the\r\ndifficulties experienced with the Reflex Zenith Tube in consequence of\r\nthe tremors of the quicksilver transmitted through the ground.\r\nAttempts were made to reduce the tremor by supporting the\r\nquicksilver trough on a stage founded at a depth of 10 feet below the\r\nsurface, but it was not in the smallest degree diminished, and the\r\nReport states that 'The experience of this investigation justifies me\r\nin believing that no practicable depth of trench prevents the\r\npropagation of tremor when the soil is like that of Greenwich Hill, a\r\ngravel, in all places very hard, and in some, cemented to the\r\nconsistency of rock.'--With respect to the regulation of the Post\r\nOffice clocks, 'One of the galvanic clocks in the Post Office\r\nDepartment, Lombard Street, is already placed in connection with the\r\nRoyal Observatory, and is regulated at noon every day ... other clocks\r\nat the General Post Office are nearly prepared for the same\r\nregulation, and I expect that the complete system will soon be in\r\naction.'--Under the head of General Remarks a careful summary is given\r\nof the work of the Observatory, and the paragraph concludes as\r\nfollows: 'Lastly there are employments which connect the scientific\r\nObservatory with the practical world; the distribution of accurate\r\ntime, the improvement of marine time-keepers, the observations and\r\ncommunications which tend to the advantage of Geography and\r\nNavigation, and the study, in a practical sense, of the modifications\r\nof Magnetism; a careful attention to these is likely to prove useful\r\nto the world, and conducive to the material prosperity of the\r\nObservatory: and these ought not to be banished from our system.'--In\r\nSeptember I prepared the first specification for the building to carry\r\nthe S.E. Dome.--In September, learning that Hansen's Lunar Tables were\r\nfinished in manuscript, I applied to Lord Clarendon and they were\r\nconveyed to me through the Foreign Office: in October I submitted to\r\nthe Admiralty the proposal for printing the Tables, and in November I\r\nlearned that the Treasury had assented to the expense.--Lieut.\r\nDaynou's eclipses and occultations for longitudes of points\r\nin South Africa, observed in 1854 and 1855, were calculated\r\nhere in this year.--On Feb. 16th I made my first application to Sir\r\nC. Wood (First Lord of the Admiralty) for assistance to C. Piazzi\r\nSmyth to carry out the Teneriffe Experiment: grounding it in part on\r\nthe failure of attempts to see the solar prominences. He gave\r\nencouragement, and on Mar. 18th I transmitted Piazzi Smyth's Memorial\r\nto the Admiralty: on May 2nd the Admiralty authorized an expense of\r\n_£500_. I drew up suggestions.--The Sheepshanks Fund: After the death\r\nof my friend Richard Sheepshanks, his sister Miss Anne Sheepshanks\r\nwished to bestow some funds in connection with the University of\r\nCambridge, Trinity College, and Astronomy, to which his name should be\r\nattached. There must have been some conversation with me, but the\r\nfirst letter is one from De Morgan in August. In September I had a\r\nconversation with Miss Sheepshanks, and sent her my first draft of a\r\nscheme, to which she assented. On Sept. 30th I wrote to Whewell\r\n(Master of Trinity) who was much trusted by Miss Sheepshanks: he\r\nconsented to take part, and made some suggestions. There was further\r\ncorrespondence, but the business did not get into shape in this\r\nyear.--In connection with the Correction of the Compass in Iron Ships:\r\nI discussed the observations made in the voyage of the Royal\r\nCharter. On Feb. 13th I proposed to the Admiralty a system of mounting\r\nthe compasses with adjustable magnets, and it was ordered to be tried\r\nin the Trident and Transit.--In February I reported to the Admiralty\r\nthat the Deal Time-Ball had been successful, and I proposed time-balls\r\nat Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Sheerness. There was much correspondence\r\nin various directions about Portsmouth and Devonport, and in March I\r\nwent to Devonport and specially examined Mount Wise and the Devonport\r\nColumn.--I had correspondence with Sir Howard Douglas about the sea\r\nbreaking over the unfinished Dover Pier. I have an idea that this\r\nfollowed evidence given by me to a Harbour Commission, in which I\r\nexpressed as a certainty that the sea will not be made to break by a\r\nvertical wall.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"I returned from Playford on Jan. 18th.--From\r\nJune 16th to August 5th I was, with my son Wilfrid, on an expedition\r\nto South Italy and Sicily: on our return from Sicily, we remained for\r\nthree days ill at Marseilles from a touch of malaria.--On Dec. 22nd I\r\nwent to Playford.--In acknowledgment of the pleasure which I had\r\nderived from excursions in the Cumberland Passes, I made a foot-bridge\r\nover a troublesome stream on the Pass of the Sty Head.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1857\r\n\r\n\"In the Report to the Visitors, when on the subject of the Altazimuth,\r\nthe following paragraph occurs: 'I alluded in a preceding section to\r\nthe cutting away of a very small portion of one of the rays of the\r\nthree-armed pier which carries the Altazimuth. The quality of the\r\nbrickwork is the best that I have ever seen, and not a single brick\r\nwas disturbed beyond those actually removed. Yet the effect was to\r\ngive the Altazimuth an inclination of about 23\". This inclination\r\nevidently depends on the elasticity of the brickwork.'--With reference\r\nto the new S.E. Equatoreal the Report states that 'The support of the\r\nnorth or upper end of the polar axis has been received, and is planted\r\nwithin the walls of the building in a position convenient for raising\r\nit to its ultimate destination. It is one piece of cast-iron, and\r\nweighs nearly 5 tons.'--Small changes as previously mentioned had been\r\nnoticed with regard to the Zero of Azimuth of the Transit Circle, and\r\nthe Report states that 'In regard to the Azimuth of the Transit\r\nCircle, and the Azimuth of its Collimator, Mr Main has brought\r\ntogether the results of several years, and the following law appears\r\nto hold. There is a well-marked annual periodical change in the\r\nposition of the Transit Circle, the southerly movement of the eastern\r\npivot having its minimum value in September, and its maximum in March,\r\nthe extreme range being about 14 seconds; and there is a similar\r\nchange, but of smaller amount, in the position of the Collimator. I\r\ncannot conjecture any cause for these changes, except in the motion of\r\nthe ground. There is also a well-marked connection between the state\r\nof level of the axis and the temperature. The eastern pivot always\r\nrises when the temperature rises, the extreme range being about 6\r\nseconds. I cannot offer any explanation of this.'--Under the head of\r\nExtraneous Works the Report states that 'The British Government had\r\nfor some years past contributed by pecuniary grants to the preparation\r\nof Prof. Hansen's Lunar Tables. In the last winter they undertook the\r\nentire expense of printing a large impression of the Tables. The\r\nreading of the proof-sheets (a very considerable labour) has been\r\neffected entirely at the Observatory. I may take this opportunity of\r\nstating that the use of these Tables has enabled me, as I think,\r\nincontestably to fix the capture of Larissa to the date B.C. 557, May\r\n19. This identification promises to prove valuable, not merely for its\r\nchronological utility, but also for its accurate determination of an\r\nastronomical epoch, the point eclipsed being exactly known, and the\r\nshadow having been very small.'--In April I gave a lecture to the\r\nRoyal Astronomical Society on the methods available through the next\r\n25 years for the determination of the Sun's parallax.--Dr\r\nLivingstone's observations for African longitudes were computed at the\r\nObservatory.--The Admiralty enquire of me about the feasibility of\r\nadopting Piazzi Smyth's construction for steadying telescopes on board\r\nship: I gave a Report, of mixed character, on the whole\r\ndiscouraging.--I had correspondence with G.P. Bond and others about\r\nphotographing the Stars and Moon.--On Feb. 17th Piazzi Smyth's books,\r\n&c. relating to the Teneriffe Experiment were sent to me: I\r\nrecommended that an abridged Report should be sent to the Royal\r\nSociety.--Respecting the Sheepshanks Fund: there was correspondence\r\nwith Miss Sheepshanks and Whewell, but nothing got into shape this\r\nyear: Miss Sheepshanks transferred to me _£10,000_ lying at Overend\r\nand Gurney's.--In November experiments were made for the longitude of\r\nEdinburgh, which failed totally from the bad state of the telegraph\r\nwire between Deptford and the Admiralty.--In June the first suggestion\r\nwas made to me by Capt. Washington for time-signals on the Lizard\r\nPoint: which in no long time I changed for the Start Point.--The\r\nAdmiralty call for estimates for a time-ball at Portsmouth: on\r\nreceiving them they decline further proceeding.--I was engaged in\r\nspeculations and correspondence about the Atlantic Submarine\r\nCable.--In the Royal Astronomical Society, I presented Memoirs and\r\ngave lectures on the three great chronological eclipses (Agathocles,\r\nThales, Larissa).\"--On Dec. 5th Airy wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of\r\nthe University of Cambridge, objecting to the proposed changes\r\nregarding the Smith's Prizes--a subject in which he took much\r\ninterest, and to which he ascribed great importance.--On Apr. 27th I\r\nwas in correspondence with G. Herbert of the Trinity House, about\r\nfloating beacons.--In July I reported to the Treasury on the Swedish\r\nCalculating Engine (I think on the occasion of Mr Farr, of the\r\nRegistrar-General's Office, applying for one).--In November I had\r\ncorrespondence about the launch of the Great Eastern, and the main\r\ndrainage of London.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"On Jan. 14th I returned from Playford.--From June\r\n27th to Aug. 5th I was travelling in Scotland with my wife and two\r\neldest sons, chiefly in the West Highlands. On our return we visited\r\nMrs Smith (my wife's mother) at Brampton.--On Dec. 26th I went to\r\nPlayford.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1858\r\n\r\n\"In the Minutes of the Visitors it is noted that the new Queen's\r\nWarrant was received. The principal change was the exclusion of the\r\nAstronomer Royal and the other Observatory Officers from the\r\nBoard.--In the Report to the Visitors it is stated that 'The Papers of\r\nthe Board of Longitude are now finally stitched into books. They will\r\nprobably form one of the most curious collections of the results of\r\nscientific enterprise, both normal and abnormal, which exists.'--It\r\nappears that the galvanic communications, external to the Observatory,\r\nhad been in a bad state, the four wires to London Bridge having\r\nprobably been injured by a thunderstorm in the last autumn, and the\r\nReport states that 'The state of the wires has not enabled us to drop\r\nthe Ball at Deal. The feeble current which arrives there has been used\r\nfor some months merely as giving a signal, by which an attendant is\r\nguided in dropping the Ball by hand.'--Regarding the new Equatoreal\r\nthe Report states that 'For the new South-East Equatoreal, the\r\nobject-glass was furnished by Messrs Merz and Son in the summer of\r\nlast year, and I made various trials of it in a temporary tube carried\r\nby the temporary mounting which I had provided, and finally I was well\r\nsatisfied with it. I cannot yet say that I have certainly divided the\r\nsmall star of gamma Andromedae; but, for such a test, a combination of\r\nfavourable circumstances is required. From what I have seen, I have no\r\ndoubt of its proving a first-rate object-glass.'--On March 15th was an\r\nannular eclipse of the Sun, for the observation of which I sent\r\nparties fully equipped to Bedford, Wellingborough, and Market\r\nHarborough. The observations failed totally in consequence of the bad\r\nweather: I myself went to Harrowden near Wellingborough.--Respecting\r\nthe Altazimuth, the Report states that with due caution as to the zero\r\nof azimuth 'the results of observation are extremely good, very nearly\r\nequal to those of the meridional instrument; perhaps I might say that\r\nthree observations with the Altazimuth are equivalent to two with the\r\nTransit Circle.'--Respecting Meteorological Observations the Report\r\nstates that 'The observations of the maximum and minimum thermometers\r\nin the Thames, interrupted at the date of the last Report, have been\r\nresumed, and are most regularly maintained. Regarding the Thames as\r\nthe grand climatic agent on London and its neighbourhood, I should\r\nmuch regret the suppression of these observations.'--After much\r\ntrouble the longitude of Edinburgh had been determined: 'the retard of\r\nthe current is 0.04s very nearly, and the difference of longitudes 12m\r\n43.05s, subject to personal equations.'--The Report concludes thus:\r\n'With regard to the direction of our labours, I trust that I shall\r\nalways be supported by the Visitors in my desire to maintain the\r\nfundamental and meridional system of the Observatory absolutely\r\nintact. This, however, does not impede the extension of our system in\r\nany way whatever, provided that such means are arranged for carrying\r\nout the extension as will render unnecessary the withdrawal of\r\nstrength from what are now the engrossing objects of the\r\nObservatory.'--I had much correspondence on Comets, of which Donati's\r\ngreat Comet was one: the tail of this Comet passed over Arcturus on\r\nOctober 5th.--Respecting the Sheepshanks Fund: In September I met\r\nWhewell at Leeds, and we settled orally the final plan of the\r\nscheme. On Oct. 27th I saw Messrs Sharp, Miss Sheepshanks's\r\nsolicitors, and drew up a Draft of the Deed of Gift. There was much\r\ncorrespondence, and on Nov. 20th I wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of\r\nCambridge University. A counter-scheme was proposed by Dr Philpott,\r\nMaster of St Catharine's College. By arrangement I attended the\r\nCouncil of the University on Dec. 3rd, and explained my views, to\r\nwhich the Council assented. On Dec. 9th the Senate accepted the gift\r\nof Miss Sheepshanks.--I had much correspondence throughout this year,\r\nwith the Treasury, Herschel, Sabine, and the Royal Society, about the\r\ncontinuation of the Magnetic Establishments. The Reductions of the\r\nMagnetic Observations 1848-1857 were commenced in February of this\r\nyear, under the direction of Mr Lucas, a computer who had been engaged\r\non the Lunar Reductions.--In this year I came to a final agreement\r\nwith the South Eastern Railway Company about defining the terms of our\r\nconnection with them for the passage of Time Signals. I was authorized\r\nby the Admiralty to sign the 'protocol' or Memorandum of Agreement,\r\nand it was signed by the South Eastern Railway Directors.--On\r\nAug. 28th I made my first proposal to Sir John Packington (First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty) for hourly time signals on the Start Point, and in\r\nSeptember I went to the Start to examine localities, &c. On Dec. 23rd\r\nthe Admiralty declined to sanction it.--I presented to the Royal\r\nSociety a Paper about drawing a great-circle trace on a Mercator's\r\nchart.--In October I gave a Lecture on Astronomy in the Assembly Room\r\nat Bury.--On Jan. 25th I was busied with my Mathematical Tracts for\r\nrepublication.\"--In this year Airy published in the Athenaeum very\r\ncareful and critical remarks on the Commissioners' Draft of Statutes\r\nfor Trinity College. He was always ready to take action in the\r\ninterests of his old College. This Paper procured him the warmest\r\ngratitude from the Fellows of the College.\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"On Jan. 23rd I returned from Playford. From July\r\n5th to Aug. 6th I was on an expedition in Switzerland with my two\r\neldest sons. At Paris we visited Le Verrier, and at Geneva we visited\r\nGautier, De La Rive, and Plantamour. We returned by Brussels.--On\r\nDec. 23rd I went to Playford.\"--In this year was erected in Playford\r\nChurchyard a granite obelisk in memory of Thomas Clarkson. It was\r\nbuilt by subscription amongst a few friends of Clarkson's, and the\r\nnegociations and arrangements were chiefly carried out by Airy, who\r\nzealously exerted himself in the work which was intended to honour the\r\nmemory of his early friend. It gave him much trouble during the years\r\n1856 to 1858.\r\n\r\nHere is a letter to the Editor of the Athenaeum on some other Trinity\r\nmatters:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             _1858, November 22_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIn the Athenaeum of November 20, page 650, column 3, paragraph 4,\r\nthere is an account of the erection of the statue of Barrow in Trinity\r\nCollege Antechapel (Cambridge) conceived in a spirit hostile to the\r\nUniversity, and written in great ignorance of the facts. On the latter\r\nI can give the writer some information.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Lansdowne, who was a Trinity man and whose son was of\r\nTrinity, intimated to the authorities of the College that he was\r\ndesirous of placing in the antechapel a statue of _Milton_. This,\r\nregard being had to the customs and the college-feelings of Cambridge,\r\nwas totally impossible. The antechapel of every college is sacredly\r\nreserved for memorials of the men of that college only; and Milton was\r\nof Christ's College. The Marquis of Lansdowne, on hearing this\r\nobjection, left the choice of the person to be commemorated, to\r\ncertain persons of the college, one of whom (a literary character of\r\nthe highest eminence and a profound admirer of Milton) has not resided\r\nin Cambridge for many years. Several names were carefully considered,\r\nand particularly one (not mentioned by your correspondent) of very\r\ngreat literary celebrity, but in whose writings there is ingrained so\r\nmuch of ribaldry and licentiousness that he was at length given\r\nup. Finally the choice rested on Barrow, not as comparable to Milton,\r\nbut as a person of reputation in his day and as the best who could be\r\nfound under all the circumstances.\r\n\r\nCromwell never was mentioned; he was a member of Sidney College:\r\nmoreover it would have been very wrong to select the exponent of an\r\nextreme political party. But Cromwell has I believe many admirers in\r\nCambridge, to which list I attach myself.\r\n\r\nI had no part in the negociations above mentioned, but I saw the\r\noriginal letters, and I answer for the perfect correctness of what I\r\nhave stated. But as I am not a principal, I decline to appear in\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be desired, both for the Athenaeum and for the public,\r\nthat such an erroneous statement should not remain uncorrected. And I\r\nwould suggest that a correction by the Editor would be just and\r\ngraceful, and would tend to support the Athenaeum in that high\r\nposition which it has usually maintained.\r\n\r\n        I am, dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very faithfully,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_Hepworth Dixon, Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1859\r\n\r\n\"The Report to the Visitors states that 'The Lunar Reductions with\r\namended elements (especially parallax) for correction of Observations\r\nfrom 1831 to 1851 are now completed. It is, I think, matter of\r\ncongratulation to the Observatory and to Astronomy, that there are now\r\nexhibited the results of uninterrupted Lunar Observations extending\r\nthrough more than a century, made at the same place, reduced under the\r\nsame superintendence and on the same general principles, and compared\r\nthroughout with the same theoretical Tables.'--After reference to the\r\ngreat value of the Greenwich Lunar Observations to Prof. Hansen in\r\nconstructing his Tables, and to the liberality of the British\r\nGovernment in their grants to Hansen, the Report continues thus: 'A\r\nstrict comparison of Hansen's Tables with the Greenwich Observations\r\nof late years, both meridional and extra-meridional, was commenced.\r\nThe same observations had, in the daily routine of the Observatory,\r\nbeen compared with the Nautical Almanac or Burckhardt's Tables. The\r\nresult for one year only (1852) has yet reached me, but it is most\r\nremarkable. The sum of squares of residual errors with Hansen's Tables\r\nis only one-eighth part of that with Burckhardt's Tables. When it is\r\nremembered that in this is included the entire effect of errors and\r\nirregularities of observation, we shall be justified in considering\r\nHansen's Tables as nearly perfect. So great a step, to the best of my\r\nknowledge, has never been made in numerical physical theory. I have\r\ncited this at length, not only as interesting to the Visitors from the\r\ncircumstance that we have on our side contributed to this great\r\nadvance, but also because an innovation, peculiar to this Observatory,\r\nhas in no small degree aided in giving a decisive character to the\r\ncomparison. I have never concealed my opinion that the introduction\r\nand vigorous use of the Altazimuth for observations of the Moon is the\r\nmost important addition to the system of the Observatory that has been\r\nmade for many years. The largest errors of Burckhardt's Tables were\r\nput in evidence almost always by the Altazimuth Observations, in\r\nportions of the Moon's Orbit which could not be touched by the\r\nmeridional instruments; they amounted sometimes to nearly 40\" of arc,\r\nand they naturally became the crucial errors for distinction between\r\nBurckhardt's and Hansen's Tables. Those errors are in all cases\r\ncorrected with great accuracy by Hansen's Tables.'--The Report\r\nconcludes with the following paragraph: 'With the inauguration of the\r\nnew Equatoreal will terminate the entire change from the old state of\r\nthe Observatory. There is not now a single person employed or\r\ninstrument used in the Observatory which was there in Mr Pond's time,\r\nnor a single room in the Observatory which is used as it was used\r\nthen. In every step of change, however, except this last, the ancient\r\nand traditional responsibilities of the Observatory have been most\r\ncarefully considered: and, in the last, the substitution of a new\r\ninstrument was so absolutely necessary, and the importance of\r\ntolerating no instrument except of a high class was so obvious, that\r\nno other course was open to us. I can only trust that, while the use\r\nof the Equatoreal within legitimate limits may enlarge the utility and\r\nthe reputation of the Observatory, it may never be permitted to\r\ninterfere with that which has always been the staple and standard work\r\nhere.'--Concerning the Sheepshanks Fund: There was much correspondence\r\nabout settling the Gift till about Feb. 21st. I took part in the first\r\nexamination for the Scholarship in October of this year, and took my\r\nplace with the Trinity Seniority, as one of their number on this\r\nfoundation, for some general business of the Fund.--With respect to\r\nthe Correction of the Compass in Iron Ships: I sent Mr Ellis to\r\nLiverpool to see some practice there in the correction of the\r\nCompass. In September I urged Mr Rundell to make a voyage in the Great\r\nEastern (just floated) for examination of her compasses, and lent him\r\ninstruments: very valuable results were obtained. Mr Archibald Smith\r\nhad edited Scoresby's Voyage in the Royal Charter, with an\r\nintroduction very offensive to me: I replied fully in the Athenaeum of\r\nNov. 7th.--The Sale of Gas Act: An Act of Parliament promoted by\r\nprivate members of the House of Commons had been passed, without the\r\nknowledge or recollection of the Government. It imposed on the\r\nGovernment various duties about the preparation of Standards.\r\nSuddenly, at the very expiration of the time allowed this\r\ncame to the knowledge of Government. On Oct. 1st Lord Monteagle\r\napplied to me for assistance. On Oct. 15th and 22nd I wrote to Mr\r\nHamilton, Secretary of the Treasury, and received authority to ask for\r\nthe assistance of Prof. W.H. Miller.--I made an examination of Mr\r\nBall's eyes (long-sighted and short-sighted I think).--In February I\r\nmade an Analysis of the Cambridge Tripos Examination, which I\r\ncommunicated to some Cambridge residents.\" In a letter on this subject\r\nto one of his Cambridge friends Airy gives his opinion as follows: \"I\r\nhave looked very carefully over the Examination Papers, and think them\r\non the whole very bad. They are utterly perverted by the insane love\r\nof Problems, and by the foolish importance given to wholly useless\r\nparts of Algebraical Geometry. For the sake of these, every Physical\r\nSubject and every useful application of pure mathematics are cut down\r\nor not mentioned.\" This led to much discussion at Cambridge. In this\r\nyear the Smith's Prizes were awarded to the 4th and 6th Wranglers.\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"On Apr. 29th Mrs Smith (my wife's mother) died at\r\nBrampton.--From July 4th to Aug. 2nd I was in France (Auvergne and the\r\nVivarais) with my two eldest sons. Maclear travelled with us to\r\nParis.--On Dec. 23rd I went to Playford.\"--Antiquities and historical\r\nquestions connected with military movements had a very great\r\nattraction for Airy. On his return from the expedition in France\r\nabove-mentioned, he engaged in considerable correspondence with\r\nmilitary authorities regarding points connected with the battle of\r\nToulouse. And in this year also he had much correspondence with the\r\nDuke of Northumberland concerning his Map of the Roman Wall, and the\r\nmilitary points relating to the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1860\r\n\r\n\"In June Mr Main accepted the office of Radcliffe Observer at Oxford\r\n(Mr Johnson having died) and resigned the First Assistancy at\r\nGreenwich: in October Mr Stone was appointed First Assistant.--At an\r\nadjourned Meeting of the Visitors on June 18th there were very heavy\r\ndiscussions on Hansen's merits, and about the grant to him. Papers\r\nwere read from Sir J. Lubbock, Babbage, South, Whewell, and\r\nme. Finally it was recommended to the Government to grant _£1000_ to\r\nHansen, which was paid to him.--In the Report to the Board of Visitors\r\nthe following remark occurs: 'The apparent existence of a discordance\r\nbetween the results of Direct Observations and Reflection Observations\r\n(after the application of corrections for flexure, founded upon\r\nobservations of the horizontal collimator wires) to an extent far\r\ngreater than can be explained by any disturbance of the direction of\r\ngravity on the quicksilver by its distance from the vertical, or by\r\nthe attraction of neighbouring masses, perplexes me much.'--With\r\nrespect to the discordance of dips of the dipping-needles, which for\r\nyears past had been a source of great trouble and puzzle, the Report\r\nstates that 'The dipping-needles are still a source of anxiety. The\r\nform which their anomalies appear to take is that of a special or\r\npeculiar value of the dip given by each separate needle. With one of\r\nthe 9-inch needles, the result always differs about a quarter of a\r\ndegree from that of the others. I can see nothing in its mechanical\r\nconstruction to explain this.--Reference is made to the spontaneous\r\ncurrents through the wires of telegraph companies, which are\r\nfrequently violent and always occur at the times of magnetic storms,\r\nand the Report continues 'It may be worth considering whether it would\r\never be desirable to establish in two directions at right angles to\r\neach other (for instance, along the Brighton Railway and along the\r\nNorth Kent Railway) wires which would photographically register in the\r\nRoyal Observatory the currents that pass in these directions,\r\nexhibiting their indications by photographic curves in close\r\njuxtaposition with the registers of the magnetic elements.'--In\r\nconnection with the Reduction of the Greenwich Lunar Observations from\r\n1831 to 1851, the Report states that 'The comparison of Hansen's Lunar\r\nTables with the Greenwich Observations, which at the last Visitation\r\nhad been completed for one year only, has now been finished for the\r\ntwelve years 1847 to 1858. The results for the whole period agree\r\nentirely, in their general spirit, with those for the year 1852 cited\r\nin the last Report. The greatest difference between the merits of\r\nBurckhardt's and Hansen's Tables appears in the Meridional Longitudes\r\n1855, when the proportion of the sum of squares of errors is as 31\r\n(Burckhardt) to 2 (Hansen). The nearest approach is in the Altazimuth\r\nLatitudes 1854, when the proportion of the sum of squares of errors is\r\nas 12 (Burckhardt) to 5 (Hansen).'--A special Address to the Members\r\nof the Board of Visitors has reference to the proposals of M. Struve\r\nfor (amongst other matters) the improved determination of the\r\nlongitude of Valencia, and the galvanic determination of the extreme\r\nEastern Station of the British triangles.--On Sept. 13th I circulated\r\namongst the Visitors my Remarks on a Paper entitled 'On the Polar\r\nDistances of the Greenwich Transit-Circle, by A. Marth,' printed in\r\nthe Astronomische Nachrichten; the Paper by Mr Marth was an elaborate\r\nattack on the Greenwich methods of observation, and my Remarks were a\r\ndetailed refutation of his statements.--On Oct. 20th I made enquiry of\r\nSabine as to the advantage of keeping up magnetic observations. On\r\nOct. 22nd he wrote, avoiding my question in some measure, but saying\r\nthat our instruments must be changed for such as those at Kew (his\r\nobservatory): I replied, generally declining to act on that\r\nadvice.--In March and April I was in correspondence with Mr Cowper\r\n(First Commissioner of Works, &c.) about the bells of the Westminster\r\nClock; also about the smoky chimneys of the various apartments of the\r\nPalace. On Apr. 21st I made my Report on the clock and bells, 20\r\nfoolscap pages. I employed a professional musician to examine the\r\ntones of the bells.--In November I was writing my book on Probable\r\nErrors, &c.--I was engaged on the Tides of Kurrachee and Bombay.--The\r\nfirst examination of Navy telescopes was made for the Admiralty.\r\n--Hoch's Paper on Aberration appeared in the Astronomische\r\nNachrichten. This (with others) led to the construction of the\r\nwater-telescope several years later.--In September I wrote in the\r\nAthenaeum against a notion of Sir H. James on the effect of an\r\nupheaval of a mountain in changing the Earth's axis. In October I had\r\ndrawn up a list of days for a possible evagation of the Earth's poles:\r\nbut apparently nothing was done upon them.\r\n\r\n\"In this year I was a good deal occupied for the Lighthouse\r\nCommission. On Feb. 21st Admiral Hamilton (chairman) applied to me for\r\nassistance. In April I went to Chance's Factory in Birmingham on this\r\nbusiness. In May I made my report on the Start Lighthouse, after\r\ninspection with the Commission. In June, with my son Hubert, I visited\r\nthe Whitby Lighthouses, and discovered a fault of a singular kind\r\nwhich most materially diminished their power. This discovery led to a\r\ngeneral examination of lighthouses by the Trinity Board, to a\r\nmodification of many, and to a general improvement of system. On June\r\n25th I reported on the Lights at Calais, Cap de Valde, Grisnez, South\r\nForeland, and North Foreland. In August I had been to the North\r\nForeland again, and in September to Calais and the Cap d'Ailly. In\r\nOctober I went with my son Hubert to Aberdeen to see the Girdleness\r\nLighthouse. On Nov. 10th I made a General Report.\r\n\r\n\"This was the year of the great total solar eclipse visible in\r\nSpain. At my representation, the Admiralty placed at my command the\r\nlarge steamship 'Himalaya' to carry about 60 astronomers, British and\r\nForeign. Some were landed at Santander: I with many at Bilbao. The\r\nEclipse was fairly well observed: I personally did not do my part\r\nwell. The most important were Mr De La Rue's photographic operations.\r\nAt Greenwich I had arranged a very careful series of observations with\r\nthe Great Equatoreal, which were fully carried out.\"\r\n\r\nThe eclipse expedition to Spain, shortly referred to above, was most\r\ninteresting, not merely from the importance of the results obtained\r\n(and some of the parties were very fortunate in the weather) but from\r\nthe character of the expedition. It was a wonderful combination of\r\nthe astronomers of Europe, who were all received on board the\r\n'Himalaya,' and were conveyed together to the coast of Spain. The\r\npolyglot of languages was most remarkable, but the utmost harmony and\r\nenthusiasm prevailed from first to last, and this had much to do with\r\nthe general success of the expedition. Those who landed at Bilbao\r\nwere received in the kindest and most hospitable manner by Mr\r\nC.B. Vignoles, the engineer-in-chief of the Bilbao and Tudela Railway,\r\nwhich was then under construction. This gentleman made arrangements\r\nfor the conveyance of parties to points in the interior of the country\r\nwhich were judged suitable for the observation of the eclipse, and\r\nplaced all the resources of his staff at the disposal of the\r\nexpedition in the most liberal manner. The universal opinion was that\r\nvery great difficulty would have been experienced without the active\r\nand generous assistance of Mr Vignoles. It is needless to say that the\r\nvote of thanks to Mr Vignoles, proposed by the Astronomer Royal during\r\nthe return voyage, was passed by acclamation and with a very sincere\r\nfeeling of gratitude: it was to the effect that 'without the great and\r\nliberal aid of Mr C.B. Vignoles, and the disinterested love of science\r\nevinced by him on this occasion, the success of the \"Himalaya\" eclipse\r\nexpedition could not have been ensured.' There is a graphic and\r\ninteresting account of the reception of the party at Bilbao given in\r\nthe 'Life of C.B. Vignoles, F.R.S., Soldier and Civil Engineer,' by\r\nO.J. Vignoles, M.A.\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"On May 26th my venerable friend Arthur Biddell\r\ndied. He had been in many respects more than a father to me: I cannot\r\nexpress how much I owed to him, especially in my youth.--From June\r\n12th to 15th I visited the Whitby Lighthouses with my son\r\nHubert.--From July 6th to 28th I was in Spain, on the 'Himalaya'\r\nexpedition, to observe the total eclipse: I was accompanied by my\r\nwife, my eldest son, and my eldest daughter.--From Oct. 5th to 18th I\r\nwent with my son Hubert to Aberdeen to see the Girdleness Lighthouse,\r\nmaking lateral trips to Cumberland in going and returning.--On\r\nDec. 21st I went to Playford.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1861\r\n\r\n\"In the Report to the Visitors there is great complaint of want of\r\nroom. 'With increase of computations, we want more room for computers;\r\nwith our greatly increased business of Chronometers and\r\nTime-Distribution, we are in want of a nearly separate series of rooms\r\nfor the Time-Department: we want rooms for book-stores; and we require\r\nrooms for the photographic operations and the computations of the\r\nMagnetic Department.'--The Report gives a curious history of Dr\r\nBradley's Observations, which in 1776 had been transferred to the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, and proceeds thus: 'More lately, I applied (in\r\nthe first instance through Lord Wrottesley) to the Vice-Chancellor, Dr\r\nJeune, in reference to the possibility of transferring these\r\nmanuscripts to the Royal Observatory.... Finally, a decree for the\r\ntransfer of the manuscript observations to the Royal Observatory,\r\nwithout any condition, was proposed to Convocation on May 2nd, and was\r\npassed unanimously. And on May 7th my Assistant, Mr Dunkin, was sent\r\nto Oxford to receive them. And thus, after a delay of very nearly a\r\ncentury, the great work of justice is at length completed, and the\r\ngreat gap in our manuscript observations is at length filled\r\nup.'--With reference to the Transit Circle, it had been remarked that\r\nthe Collimators were slightly disturbed by the proximity of the\r\ngas-flames of their illuminators, and after various experiments as to\r\nthe cause of it, the Report proceeds thus: 'To my great surprise, I\r\nfound that the disturbance was entirely due to the radiation of the\r\nflame upon a very small corner (about 16 square inches) of the large\r\nand massive stone on which the collimator is planted. The tin plates\r\nwere subsequently shaped in such a manner as to protect the stone as\r\nwell as the metal; and the disturbance has entirely ceased.'\r\n--Regarding the large S.E. Equatoreal, the Report states that\r\n'On the character of its object-glass I am now able to speak, first,\r\nfrom the examination of Mr Otto Struve, made in a favourable state of\r\natmosphere; secondly, from the examinations of my Assistants (I have\r\nnot myself obtained a sight of a test-object on a night of very good\r\ndefinition). It appears to be of the highest order. The small star of\r\ngamma Andromedae is so far separated as to shew a broad dark space\r\nbetween its components. Some blue colour is shewn about the bright\r\nplanets.'--It is noted in the Report that 'The Equatoreal observations\r\nof the Solar Eclipse are completely reduced; and the results are\r\nvaluable. It appears from them that the error in right ascension of\r\nBurckhardt's Lunar Tables at the time of the eclipse amounted to about\r\n38\"; while that of Hansen's (ultimately adopted by Mr Hind for the\r\ncalculation of the eclipse) did not exceed 3\".'--With regard to\r\nChronometers it is stated that 'By use of the Chronometer Oven, to\r\nwhich I have formerly alluded, we have been able to give great\r\nattention to the compensation. I have reason to think that we are\r\nproducing a most beneficial effect on the manufacture and adjustment\r\nof chronometers in general.'--With regard to the Cape of Good Hope\r\nObservatory and Survey, the Admiralty enquire of me when the Survey\r\nwork will be completed, and I enquire of Maclear 'How is the printing\r\nof your Survey Work?' In 1862 I began to press it strongly, and in\r\n1863 very strongly.--I introduced a method (constantly pursued since\r\nthat time at the Royal Observatory) for computing interpolations\r\nwithout changes of sign.--I had correspondence with Herschel and\r\nFaraday, on the possible effect of the Sun's radiant heat on the sea,\r\nas explaining the curve of diurnal magnetic inequality. (That diurnal\r\ninequality was inferred from the magnetic reductions 1848-1857, which\r\nwere terminated in 1860.)--Regarding the proposal of hourly\r\ntime-signals on the Start Point, I consulted telegraph engineers upon\r\nthe practical points, and on Dec. 21st I proposed a formal scheme, in\r\ncomplete detail. (The matter has been repeatedly brought before the\r\nAdmiralty, but has been uniformly rejected.)--I was engaged on the\r\nquestion of the bad ocular vision of two or three persons.--The\r\nBritish Association Meeting was held at Manchester: I was President of\r\nSection A. I gave a Lecture on the Eclipse of 1860 to an enormous\r\nattendance in the Free Trade Hall.\" The following record of the\r\nLecture is extracted from Dr E.J. Routh's Obituary Notice of Airy\r\nwritten for the Proceedings of the Royal Society. \"At the meeting of\r\nthe British Association at Manchester in 1861, Mr Airy delivered a\r\nLecture on the Solar Eclipse of 1860 to an assembly of perhaps 3000\r\npersons. The writer remembers the great Free Trade Hall crowded to\r\nexcess with an immense audience whose attention and interest,\r\nnotwithstanding a weak voice, he was able to retain to the very end of\r\nthe lecture....The charm of Professor Airy's lectures lay in the\r\nclearness of his explanations. The subjects also of his lectures were\r\ngenerally those to which his attention had been turned by other\r\ncauses, so that he had much that was new to tell. His manner was\r\nslightly hesitating, and he used frequent repetitions, which perhaps\r\nwere necessary from the newness of the ideas. As the lecturer\r\nproceeded, his hearers forgot these imperfections and found their\r\nwhole attention rivetted to the subject matter.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"On Jan. 2nd there was a most remarkable\r\ncrystallization of the ice on the flooded meadows at Playford: the\r\nfrost was very severe.--From June 20th to Aug. 1st I was at the Grange\r\nnear Keswick (where I hired a house) with my wife and most of my\r\nfamily.--From Nov. 5th to 14th I was on an expedition in the South of\r\nScotland with my son Wilfrid: we walked with our knapsacks by the\r\nRoman Road across the Cheviots to Jedburgh.--On Dec. 21st I went to\r\nPlayford.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1862\r\n\r\n\"The Report to the Board of Visitors states that 'A new range of\r\nwooden buildings (the Magnetic Offices) is in progress at the\r\nS.S.E. extremity of the Magnetic Ground. It will include seven\r\nrooms.'--Also 'I took this opportunity (the relaying of the\r\nwater-main) of establishing two powerful fire-plugs (one in the Front\r\nCourt, and one in the Magnetic Ground); a stock of fire-hose adapted\r\nto the \"Brigade-Screw\" having been previously secured in the\r\nObservatory.'--'Two wires, intended for the examination of spontaneous\r\nearth-currents, have been carried from the Magnetic Observatory to the\r\nRailway Station in the town of Greenwich. From this point one wire is\r\nto be led to a point in the neighbourhood of Croydon, the other to a\r\npoint in the neighbourhood of Dartford. Each wire is to be connected\r\nat its two extremities with the Earth. The angle included between the\r\ngeneral directions of these two lines is nearly a right angle.'--'The\r\nKew unifilar magnetometer, adapted to the determination of the\r\nhorizontal part of terrestrial magnetic force in absolute measure, was\r\nmounted in the summer of 1861; and till 1862 February, occasional\r\nobservations (14 in all) were taken simultaneously with the old and\r\nwith the new instrument. The comparison of results shewed a steady but\r\nvery small difference, not greater probably than may correspond to the\r\nomission of the inverse seventh powers of distance in the theoretical\r\ninvestigation; proving that the old instrument had been quite\r\nefficient for its purpose.'--Great efforts had been made to deduce a\r\nlaw from the Diurnal Inequalities in Declination and Horizontal Force,\r\nas shewn by the Magnetic observations; but without success: the Report\r\nstates that 'The results are most amazing, for the variation in\r\nmagnitude as well as in law. What cosmical change can be indicated by\r\nthem is entirely beyond my power of conjecture.'--'I have alluded, in\r\nthe two last Reports, to the steps necessary, on the English side, for\r\ncompleting the great Arc of Parallel from Valencia to the Volga. The\r\nRussian portion of the work is far advanced, and will be finished (it\r\nis understood) in the coming summer. It appeared to me therefore that\r\nthe repetition of the measure of astronomical longitude between\r\nGreenwich and Valencia could be no longer delayed. Two Assistants of\r\nthe Royal Observatory (Mr Dunkin and Mr Criswick) will at once proceed\r\nto Valencia, for the determination of local time and the management of\r\ngalvanic signals.'--'I now ask leave to press the subject of Hourly\r\nTime Signals at the Start Point on the attention of the Board, and to\r\nsubmit the advantage of their addressing the Board of Admiralty upon\r\nit. The great majority of outward-bound ships pass within sight of the\r\nStart, and, if an hourly signal were exhibited, would have the means\r\nof regulating their chronometers at a most critical part of their\r\nvoyage. The plan of the entire system of operations is completely\r\narranged. The estimated expense of outfit is _£2017_, and the\r\nestimated annual expense is _£326_; both liable to some uncertainty,\r\nbut sufficiently exact to shew that the outlay is inconsiderable in\r\ncomparison with the advantages which might be expected from it. I know\r\nno direction of the powers of the Observatory which would tend so\r\nenergetically to carry out the great object of its establishment,\r\nviz. \"the finding out the so much desired Longitude at Sea.\"'--The\r\nattention of the Visitors is strongly drawn to the pressure on the\r\nstrength of the Observatory caused by the observation of the numerous\r\nsmall planets, and the paragraph concludes thus: 'I shall, however,\r\nagain endeavour to effect a partition of this labour with some other\r\nObservatory.'--A small fire having occurred in the Magnetic\r\nObservatory, a new building of zinc, for the operation of\r\nnaphthalizing the illuminating gas, is in preparation, external to the\r\nObservatory: and thus one of the possible sources of accidental fire\r\nwill be removed.--Miss Sheepshanks added, through me, _£2000_ to her\r\nformer gift: I transferred it, I believe, to the Master and Seniors of\r\nTrinity College.\"--In this year Airy contributed to the Royal Society\r\ntwo Papers, one \"On the Magnetic properties of Hot-Rolled and\r\nCold-Rolled Malleable Iron,\" the other \"On the Strains in the Interior\r\nof Beams.\" He gave evidence before the Select Committee on Weights and\r\nMeasures, and also before the Public Schools Commission.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1862 a difference arose between Airy and\r\nMajor-General Sabine, in consequence of remarks made by the latter at\r\na meeting of the Committee of Recommendations of the British\r\nAssociation. These remarks were to the effect \"That it is necessary to\r\nmaintain the complete system of self-registration of magnetic\r\nphenomena at the Kew Observatory, because no sufficient system of\r\nmagnetic record is maintained elsewhere in England\"; implying\r\npointedly that the system at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich was\r\ninsufficient. This matter was taken up very warmly by Airy, and after\r\na short and acrimonious correspondence with Sabine, he issued a\r\nprivate Address to the Visitors, enclosing copies of the\r\ncorrespondence with his remarks, and requesting the Board to take the\r\nmatter of this attack into their careful consideration. This Address\r\nis dated November 1862, and it was followed by another dated January\r\n1863, which contains a careful reply to the various points of General\r\nSabine's attack, and concludes with a distinct statement that he (the\r\nAstronomer Royal) can no longer act in confidence with Sabine as a\r\nMember of the Board of Visitors.\r\n\r\nOf private history: There were the usual short visits to Playford at\r\nthe beginning and end of the year.--From June 28th to Aug. 5th he was\r\nin Scotland (chiefly in the Western Highlands) with his wife and his\r\nsons Hubert and Osmund. In the course of this journey he visited the\r\nCorryvreckan whirlpool near the island of Scarba, and the following\r\nparagraph relating to this expedition is extracted from his journal:\r\n\"Landed in Black Mile Bay, island of Luing, at 10.30. Here by previous\r\narrangement with Mr A. Brown, agent of the steam-boat company, a\r\n4-oared boat was waiting to take us to Scarba and the Corryvreckan. We\r\nwere pulled across to the island of Lunga, and rowed along its length,\r\ntill we came to the first channel opening from the main sea, which the\r\nsailors called the Little Gulf. Here the sea was rushing inwards in a\r\nmanner of which I had no conception. Streams were running with raving\r\nspeed, sometimes in opposite directions side by side, with high\r\nbroken-headed billows. Where the streams touched were sometimes great\r\nwhirls (one not many yards from our boat) that looked as if they would\r\nsuck anything down. Sometimes among all this were great smooth parts\r\nof the sea, still in a whirling trouble, which were surrounded by the\r\nmad currents. We seemed entirely powerless among all these.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this year (1862) the Duke of Manchester, in\r\nwriting to the Rev. W. Airy, had said, \"I wish your brother, the\r\nAstronomer Royal, could be induced to have investigations made as to\r\nwhether the aspects of the Planets have any effect on the weather.\"\r\nThis enquiry produced the following reply:\r\n\r\nA subject like that of the occult influences of the planets (using the\r\nword occult in no bad sense but simply as meaning not _thoroughly_\r\ntraced) can be approached in two ways--either by the à priori\r\nprobability of the existence of such influences, or by the à\r\nposteriori evidence of their effects. If the two can be combined, the\r\nsubject may be considered as claiming the dignity of a science. Even\r\nif the effects alone are certain, it may be considered that we have a\r\nscience of inferior degree, wanting however that definiteness of law\r\nand that general plausibility which can only be given when true\r\ncauses, in accordance with antecedent experience in other cases, can\r\nbe suggested.\r\n\r\nNow in regard to the à priori probability of the existence of\r\nplanetary influences, I am far from saying that such a thing is\r\nimpossible. The discoveries of modern philosophy have all tended to\r\nshew that there may be many things about us, unknown even to the\r\nscientific world, but which well-followed accidents reveal with the\r\nmost positive certainty. It is known that every beam of light is\r\naccompanied by a beam of chemical agency, totally undiscoverable to\r\nthe senses of light or warmth, but admitting of separation from the\r\nluminous and warm rays; and producing photogenic effects. We know\r\nthat there are disturbances of magnetism going on about us, affecting\r\nwhole continents at a time, unknown to men in general, but traceable\r\nwith facility and certainty, and which doubtless affect even our\r\nbrains and nerves (which are indisputably subject to the influence of\r\nmagnetism).\r\n\r\nNow in the face of these things I will not undertake to say that there\r\nis any impossibility, or even any want of plausibility in the\r\nsupposition that bodies external to the earth may affect us. It may\r\nwell be cited in its favour that it is certain that the sun affects\r\nour magnetism (it is doubtful whether it does so _im_mediately, or\r\nmediately by giving different degrees of warmth to different parts of\r\nthe earth), and it is believed on inferior evidence that the moon also\r\naffects it. It may therefore seem not impossible or unplausible that\r\nother celestial bodies may affect perhaps others of the powers of\r\nnature about us. But there I must stop. The denial of the\r\nimpossibility is no assertion of the truth or probability, and I\r\nabsolutely decline to take either side--either that the influences are\r\nreal, or that the influences are unreal--till I see evidence of their\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nSuch evidence it is extremely difficult to extract from ordinary facts\r\nof observation. I have alluded to the sun's daily disturbance of the\r\nmagnet as one of the most certain of influences, yet if you were to\r\nobserve the magnet for a single day or perhaps for several days, you\r\nmight see no evidence of that influence, so completely is it involved\r\nwith other disturbances whose causes and laws are totally unknown.\r\n\r\nI believe that, in addition to the effects ascribable to Newtonian\r\ngravitation (as general motion of the earth, precession of the\r\nequinoxes, and tides), this magnetic disturbance is the only one yet\r\nestablished as depending on an external body. Men in general, however,\r\ndo not think so. It appears to be a law of the human mind, to love to\r\ntrace an effect to a cause, and to be ready to assent to any specious\r\ncause. Thus all practical men of the lower classes, even those whose\r\npecuniary interests are concerned in it, believe firmly in the\r\ninfluence of the moon upon the winds and the weather. I believe that\r\nevery careful examiner of recorded facts (among whom I place myself as\r\nregards the winds) has come to the conclusion that the influence of\r\nthe moon is not discoverable.\r\n\r\nI point out these two things (magnetic disturbances and weather) as\r\ntending to shew that notoriety or the assumed consent of practical\r\nmen, are of no value. The unnotorious matter may be quite certain, the\r\nnotorious matter may have no foundation. Everything must stand on its\r\nown evidence, as completely digested and examined.\r\n\r\nOf such evidence the planetary influence has not a particle.\r\n\r\nMy intended short note has, in the course of writing, grown up into a\r\ndiscourse of very unreasonable length; and it is possible that a large\r\nportion of it has only increased obscurity. At any rate I can add\r\nnothing, I believe, which can help to explain more fully my views on\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this year (1862, June 9th) Airy received the Honorary Degree of\r\nLL.D. in the University of Cambridge. He was nominated by the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, as appears from the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                              LISMORE CASTLE, IRELAND,\r\n                                                 _April 19th, 1862_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIt is proposed according to usage to confer a considerable number of\r\nHonorary Degrees on the occasion of my first visit to Cambridge as\r\nChancellor of the University.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will allow me to include your name in that portion of\r\nthe list which I have been invited to draw up.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony is fixed for the 10th of June.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very truly,\r\n            DEVONSHIRE.\r\n\r\n_The Astronomer Royal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAiry's reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                           LONDON, S.E.\r\n                                           _1862, April 21_.\r\n\r\nMY LORD DUKE,\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly gratified by your communication this day received,\r\nconveying a proposal which I doubt not is suggested by your Grace's\r\nrecollection of transactions now many years past.\r\n\r\nI have always been desirous of maintaining my connection with my\r\nUniversity, and have in various ways interested myself practically in\r\nits concerns. It would give me great pleasure to have the connection\r\nstrengthened in the flattering way which you propose.\r\n\r\nI had conceived that alumni of the University were not admissible to\r\nhonorary degrees; but upon this point the information possessed by\r\nyour Grace, as Chancellor of the University, cannot be disputed.\r\n\r\n          I am, my Lord Duke,\r\n        Your Grace's very faithful servant,\r\n              G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_His Grace\r\n  The Duke of Devonshire_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were in all 19 Honorary Degrees of Doctor of Laws conferred on\r\nthe 9th of June, including men of such eminence as Armstrong, Faraday,\r\nand Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1863\r\n\r\nIn this year there were several schemes for a Railway through the\r\nlower part of Greenwich Park, the most important being the scheme of\r\nthe London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company. In reference to this\r\nscheme the Report to the Visitors states \"I may say briefly that I\r\nbelieve that it would be possible to render such a railway innocuous\r\nto the Observatory; it would however be under restrictions which might\r\nbe felt annoying to the authorities of the Railway, but whose\r\nrelaxation would almost ensure ruin to the Observatory.\"--\"The\r\nmeridional observations of Mars in the Autumn of 1862 have been\r\ncompared with those made at the Observatory of Williamstown, near\r\nMelbourne, Australia, and they give for mean solar parallax the value\r\n8.932\", exceeding the received value by about 1/24th part. (A value\r\nnearly identical with this 8.93\" has also been found by comparing the\r\nPulkowa and Cape of Good Hope Observations.)\"--\"The results of the new\r\nDip-Instrument in 1861 and 1862 appear to give a firm foundation for\r\nspeculations on the state and change of the dip. As a general result,\r\nI may state as probable that the value of dip in the middle of 1843\r\nwas about 69°1', and in the middle of 1862 about 68°11'. The decrease\r\nof dip appears to be more rapid in the second half of this interval\r\nthan in the first; the dip at beginning of 1853 being about\r\n68°44'.\"--With reference to the re-determination of the longitude of\r\nValencia, it is stated that \"The concluded longitude agrees almost\r\nexactly with that determined by the transmission of chronometers in\r\n1844; and entitles us to believe that the longitudes of Kingstown and\r\nLiverpool, steps in the chronometer conveyance, were determined with\r\nequal accuracy.\"--\"The computations, for inferring the direction and\r\namount of movement of the Solar System in space from the observed\r\nproper motions of 1167 stars, have been completed. The result is, that\r\nthe Sun is moving towards a point, R.A. 264°, N.P.D. 65° (not very\r\ndifferent from Sir W. Herschel's, but depending much in N.P.D. on the\r\naccuracy of Bradley's quadrant observations), and that its annual\r\nmotion subtends, at the distance of a star of the first magnitude, the\r\nangle 0.4\". But the comparison, of the sum of squares of apparent\r\nproper motions uncorrected, with the sum of squares of apparent proper\r\nmotions corrected for motion of Sun, shews so small an advance in the\r\nexplanation of the star's apparent movements as to throw great doubt\r\non the certainty of results; the sum of squares being diminished by\r\nonly 1/25th part.\"--\"I had been writing strongly to Maclear on the\r\ndelays in publishing both the geodetic work and the Star Catalogue at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope: he resolves to go on with these works. In\r\nDecember I am still very urgent about the geodesy.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: There was the usual short visit to Playford at the\r\nbeginning and end of the year.--\"From June 27th to August 10th I was\r\ntravelling in the North and West of Scotland with my wife, my youngest\r\nson Osmund, and my daughter Annot.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this year the offer of Knighthood (for the third time) was made to\r\nAiry through the Rt Hon.

Lewis replied that the fees would amount to\r\nabout _£30_, an intimation which produced the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH, S.E.\r\n                                                  _1863, Feb. 19th_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge your letter of yesterday: and I advert to that\r\npart of it in which it is stated that the Fees on Knighthood amount to\r\nabout _£30_.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven years ago the same rank was offered to me by Lord John\r\nRussell and Mr Spring Rice (then Ministers of the Crown), with the\r\nexpress notice that no fees would be payable. I suppose that the usage\r\n(whatever it be) on which that notice was founded still subsists.\r\n\r\nTo a person whose annual income little more than suffices to meet the\r\nannual expenses of a very moderate establishment, an unsought honour\r\nmay be an incumbrance. It appears, at any rate, opposed to the spirit\r\nof such an honour, that it should be loaded with Court Expenses in its\r\nvery creation.\r\n\r\nI hope that the principle stated in 1835 may serve as precedent on\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\n        I am, dear Sir,\r\n          Your very faithful servant,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_The Right Honourable\r\n  Sir G. C. Lewis, Bart.,\r\n    &c. &c. &c._\r\n\r\nNo intimation however was received that the fees would be remitted on\r\nthe present occasion, and after consideration the proposed Knighthood\r\nwas declined in the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                    ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH, S.E.\r\n                                                   _1863, April 15_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have frequently reflected on the proposal made by you of the honour\r\nof Knighthood to myself. I am very grateful to you for the favourable\r\nopinion which you entertain in regard to my supposed claims to notice,\r\nand for the kindness with which you proposed publicly to express\r\nit. But on consideration I am strongly impressed with the feeling that\r\nthe conditions attached by established regulation to the conferring of\r\nsuch an honour would be unacceptable to me, and that the honour itself\r\nwould in reality, under the circumstances of my family-establishment\r\nand in my social position, be an incumbrance to me. And finally I have\r\nthought it best most respectfully, and with a full sense of the\r\nkindness of yourself and of the Queen's Government towards me, to ask\r\nthat the proposal might be deferred.\r\n\r\nThere is another direction in which a step might be made, affecting my\r\npersonal position in a smaller degree, but not tending to incommode\r\nme, which I would ask leave to submit to your consideration. It is,\r\nthe definition of the Rank of the Astronomer Royal. The singular\r\ncharacter of the office removes it from ordinary rules of rank, and\r\nsometimes may produce a disagreeable contest of opinions. The only\r\noffices of similar character corresponding in other conditions to that\r\nof the British Astronomer Royal are those of the Imperial Astronomers\r\nat Pulkowa (St Petersburg) and Paris. In Russia, where every rank is\r\nclearly defined by that of military grade, the Imperial Astronomer has\r\nthe rank of Major-General. In France, the definition is less precise,\r\nbut the present Imperial Astronomer has been created (as an attachment\r\nof rank to the office) a Senator of the Empire.\r\n\r\n        I am, dear Sir,\r\n          Your very faithful servant,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_The Rt Hon. Sir George C. Lewis, Bart.,\r\n  &c. &c. &c._\r\n\r\nSir G. C. Lewis died before receiving this letter, and the letter was\r\nafterwards forwarded to Lord Palmerston. Some correspondence followed\r\nbetween Lord Palmerston and Airy on the subject of attaching a\r\ndefinite rank to the office of Astronomer Royal, as proposed in the\r\nabove letter. But the Home Office (for various reasons set forth)\r\nstated that the suggestion could not be complied with, and the whole\r\nsubject dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1864\r\n\r\nThe following remarks are extracted from the Report of the Astronomer\r\nRoyal to the Board of Visitors.--\"In a very heavy squall which\r\noccurred in the gale of December 2 of last year, the stay of the lofty\r\niron pillar outside of the Park Rails, which carried our telegraph\r\nwires, gave way, and the pillar and the whole system of wires\r\nfell.\"--\"An important alteration has been made in the Magnetic\r\nObservatory. For several years past, various plans have been under\r\nconsideration for preventing large changes of temperature in the room\r\nwhich contains the magnetic instruments. At length I determined to\r\nexcavate a subterraneous room or cellar under the original room. The\r\nwork was begun in the last week in January, and in all important\r\npoints it is now finished.\"--\"In the late spring, some alarm was\r\noccasioned by the discovery that the Parliamentary Standard of the\r\nPound Weight had become coated with an extraneous substance produced\r\nby the decomposition of the lining of the case in which it was\r\npreserved. It was decided immediately to compare it with the three\r\nParliamentary Copies, of which that at the Observatory is one. The\r\nNational Standard was found to be entirely uninjured.\"--\"On November\r\n16 of last year, the Transit Instrument narrowly escaped serious\r\ninjury from an accident. The plate chain which carries the large\r\nwestern counterpoise broke. The counterpoise fell upon the pier,\r\ndestroying the massive gun-metal wheels of the lifting machinery, but\r\nwas prevented from falling further by the iron stay of the gas-burner\r\nflue.\"--\"The Prismatic Spectrum-Apparatus had been completed in\r\n1863. Achromatic object-glasses are placed on both sides of the prism,\r\nso that each pencil of light through the prism consists of parallel\r\nrays; and breadth is given to the spectrum by a cylindrical lens. The\r\nspectral lines are seen straighter than before, and generally it is\r\nbelieved that their definition is improved.\"--\"For observation of the\r\nsmall planets, a convention has been made with M. Le Verrier. From\r\nnew moon to full moon, all the small planets visible to 13h are\r\nobserved at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich. From full moon to new\r\nmoon, all are observed at the Imperial Observatory of Paris. The\r\nrelief gained in this way is very considerable.\"--\"In determining the\r\nvariations in the power of the horizontal-force and vertical-force\r\nmagnets depending on temperature, it was found by experiment that this\r\ndepended materially on whether the magnet was heated by air or by\r\nwater, and 'The result of these experiments (with air) is to give a\r\ncoefficient for temperature correction four or five times as great as\r\nthat given by the water-heatings,'\"--\"With regard to the discordances\r\nof the results of observations of dip-needles, experiments had been\r\nmade with needles whose breadth was in the plane passing through the\r\naxis of rotation, and it appeared that the means of extreme\r\ndiscordances were, for an ordinary needle 11' 45\", and for a flat\r\nneedle 3' 27\",\" and the Report continues thus: \"After this I need not\r\nsay that I consider it certain that the small probable errors which\r\nhave been attributed to ordinary needles are a pure delusion.\"--The\r\nReport states that in the various operations connected with the trials\r\nand repairs of chronometers, and the system of time-signals\r\ntransmitted to various time-balls and clocks, about one-fourth of the\r\nstrength of the Observatory is employed, and it continues thus:\r\n\"Viewing the close dependence of Nautical Astronomy upon accurate\r\nknowledge of time, there is perhaps no department of the Observatory\r\nwhich answers more completely to the original utilitarian intentions\r\nof the Founder of the Royal Observatory.\"--\"With regard to the\r\nproposal of time-signals at the Start Point, it appears that\r\ncommunications referring to this proposal had passed between the Board\r\nof Admiralty and the Board of Trade, of which the conclusion was, that\r\nthe Board of Trade possessed no funds applicable to the defraying of\r\nthe expenses attending the execution of the scheme. And the Admiralty\r\ndid not at present contemplate the establishment of these time-signals\r\nunder their own authority.\"--Amongst other Papers in this year, Airy's\r\nPaper entitled \"First Analysis of 177 Magnetic Storms,\" &c., was read\r\nbefore the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"There was the usual visit to Playford in the\r\nbeginning of the year.--From June 8th to 23rd I made an excursion with\r\nmy son Hubert to the Isle of Man, and the Lake District.--From\r\nSept. 7th to 14th I was on a trip to Cornwall with my two eldest sons,\r\nchiefly in the mining district.--In August of this year my eldest\r\n(surviving) daughter, Hilda, was married to Mr E.J. Routh, Fellow of\r\nSt Peter's College, Cambridge, at Greenwich Parish Church. They\r\nafterwards resided at Cambridge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1865\r\n\r\n\"Our telegraphic communications of every kind were again destroyed by\r\na snow-storm and gale of wind which occurred on Jan. 28th, and which\r\nbroke down nearly all the posts between the Royal Observatory and the\r\nGreenwich Railway Station.--The Report to the Visitors states that\r\n'The only change of Buildings which I contemplate as at present\r\nrequired is the erection of a fire-proof Chronometer Room. The\r\npecuniary value of Chronometers stored in the Observatory is sometimes\r\nperhaps as much as _£8000_.'--The South Eastern and London Chatham and\r\nDover scheme for a railway through the Park was again brought\r\nforward. There was a meeting of Sir J. Hanmer's Committee at the\r\nObservatory on May 26th. Mr Stone was sent hastily to Dublin to make\r\nobservations on Earth-disturbance by railways there. I had been\r\nbefore the Committee on May 25th. On Sept. 1st I approved of an\r\namended plan. In reference to this matter the Report states that 'It\r\nis proper to remark that the shake of the Altazimuth felt in the\r\nearthquake of 1863, Oct. 5th, when no such shake was felt with\r\ninstruments nearer to the ground (an experience which, as I have heard\r\non private authority, is supported by observation of artificial\r\ntremors), gives reason to fear that, at distances from a railway which\r\nwould sufficiently defend the lower instruments, the loftier\r\ninstruments (as the Altazimuth and the Equatoreals) would be sensibly\r\naffected.'--Some of the Magnets had been suspended by steel wires,\r\ninstead of silk, of no greater strength than was necessary for safety,\r\nand the Report states that 'Under the pressure of business, the\r\ndetermination of various constants of adjustment was deferred to the\r\nend of the year. The immediate results of observation, however, began\r\nto excite suspicion; and after a time it was found that, in spite of\r\nthe length of the suspending wire (about 8 feet) the\r\ntorsion-coefficient was not much less than 1/6. The wires were\r\npromptly dismounted, and silk skeins substituted for them. With these,\r\nthe torsion-coefficient is about 1/210.'--The Dip-Instrument, which\r\nhad given great trouble by the irregularities of the dip-results, had\r\nbeen compared with two dip-instruments from Kew Observatory, which\r\ngave very good and accordant results. 'It happened that Mr Simms, by\r\nwhom our instruments now in use were prepared, and who had personally\r\nwitnessed our former difficulties, was present during some of these\r\nexperiments. Our own instrument being placed in his hands (Nov. 10th\r\nto 19th) for another purpose, he spontaneously re-polished the\r\napparently faultless agate-bearings. To my great astonishment, the\r\ninconsistencies of every kind have nearly or entirely vanished. On\r\nraising and lowering the needles, they return to the same readings,\r\nand the dips with the same needle appear generally consistent.' Some\r\npractical details of the polishing process by which this result had\r\nbeen secured are then given.--After numerous delays, the apparatus for\r\nthe self-registration of Spontaneous Earth Currents was brought into a\r\nworking state in the month of March. A description of the arrangement\r\nadopted is given in the Report.--'All Chronometers on trial are rated\r\nevery day, by comparison with one of the clocks sympathetic with the\r\nMotor Clock. Every Chronometer, whether on trial or returned from a\r\nchronometer-maker as repaired, is tried at least once in the heat of\r\nthe Chronometer-Oven, the temperature being usually limited to 90°\r\nFahrenheit; and, guided by the results of very long experience, we\r\nhave established it as a rule, that every trial in heat be continued\r\nthrough three weeks.'--'The only employment extraneous to the\r\nObservatory which has occupied any of my time within the last year is\r\nthe giving three Lectures on the Magnetism of Iron Ships (at the\r\nrequest of the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education) in the\r\nTheatre of the South Kensington Museum. The preparations, however,\r\nfor these Lectures, to be given in a room ill-adapted to them,\r\noccupied a great deal of my own time, and of the time of an Assistant\r\nof the Observatory.'--'Referring to a matter in which the interests of\r\nAstronomy are deeply concerned, I think it right to report to the\r\nVisitors my late representation to the Government, to the effect that,\r\nin reference to possible observation of the Transit of Venus in 1882,\r\nit will be necessary in no long time to examine the coasts of the\r\nGreat Southern Continent.'\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"There were the usual visits to Playford at the\r\nbeginning and end of the year.--From June 18th to 26th I was on a trip\r\nin Wales with my sons Hubert and Osmund.--From Sept. 6th to Oct. 2nd I\r\nwas staying with most of my family at Portinscale near Keswick: we\r\nreturned by Barnard Castle, Rokeby, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n               AT GREENWICH OBSERVATORY--1866 TO 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1866\r\n\r\nIn this year the cube of the Transit Circle was pierced, to permit\r\nreciprocal observations of the Collimators without raising the\r\ninstrument. This involved the construction of improved Collimators,\r\nwhich formed the subject of a special Address to the Members of the\r\nBoard of Visitors on Oct. 21st 1865.--From the Report to the Visitors\r\nit appears that \"On May 23rd 1865, a thunderstorm of great violence\r\npassed very close to the Observatory. After one flash of lightning, I\r\nwas convinced that the principal building was struck. Several\r\ngalvanometers in the Magnetic Basement were destroyed. Lately it has\r\nbeen remarked that one of the old chimneys of the principal building\r\nhad been dislocated and slightly twisted, at a place where it was\r\nsurrounded by an iron stay-band led from the Telegraph Pole which was\r\nplanted upon the leads of the Octagon Room.\"--\"On consideration of the\r\nserious interruptions to which we have several times been exposed from\r\nthe destruction of our open-air Park-wires (through snow-storms and\r\ngales), I have made an arrangement for leading the whole of our wires\r\nin underground pipes as far as the Greenwich Railway Station.\"--\"The\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons, to whom the Greenwich and Woolwich\r\nLine of the South Eastern Railway was referred, finally assented to\r\nthe adoption of a line which I indicated, passing between the\r\nbuildings of the Hospital Schools and the public road to\r\nWoolwich.\"--\"The Galvanic Chronometer attached to the S. E. Equatoreal\r\noften gave us a great deal of trouble. At last I determined, on the\r\nproposal of Mr Ellis, to attempt an extension of Mr R. L. Jones's\r\nregulating principle. It is well known that Mr Jones has with great\r\nsuccess introduced the system of applying galvanic currents\r\noriginating in the vibrations of a normal pendulum, not to drive the\r\nwheelwork of other clocks, but to regulate to exact agreement the\r\nrates of their pendulums which were, independently, nearly in\r\nagreement; each clock being driven by weight-power as before. The same\r\nprinciple is now applied to the chronometer.... The construction is\r\nperfectly successful; the chronometer remains in coincidence with the\r\nTransit Clock through any length of time, with a small constant error\r\nas is required by mechanical theory.\"--\"The printed volume of\r\nObservations for 1864 has two Appendixes; one containing the\r\ncalculations of the value of the Moon's Semi-diameter deduced from 295\r\nOccultations observed at Cambridge and Greenwich from 1832 to 1860,\r\nand shewing that the Occultation Semi-diameter is less than the\r\nTelescopic Semi-diameter by 2\"; the other containing the reduction of\r\nthe Planetary Observations made at the Royal Observatory in the years\r\n1831-1835; filling up the gap, between the Planetary Reductions\r\n1750-1830 made several years ago under my superintendence, and the\r\nReductions contained in the Greenwich Volumes 1836 to the present\r\ntime: and conducted on the same general principles.\"--\"Some trouble\r\nhad been found in regulating the temperature of the Magnetic Basement,\r\nbut it was anticipated that in future there would be no difficulty in\r\nkeeping down the annual variation within about 5° and the diurnal\r\nvariation within 3°.--Longitudes in America were determined in this\r\nyear by way of Valencia and Newfoundland: finished by Nov. 14th.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: In April he made a short visit to Ventnor in the\r\nIsle of Wight.--From June 15th to July 23rd he was on an expedition in\r\nNorway with his son Osmund and his nephew Gorell Barnes.--There was\r\nprobably a short stay at Playford in the winter.\r\n\r\nIn this and in the previous year (1865) the free-thinking\r\ninvestigations of Colenso, the Bishop of Natal, had attracted much\r\nnotice, and had procured him the virulent hostility of a numerous\r\nsection. His income was withheld from him, and in consequence a\r\nsubscription fund was raised for his support by his admirers. Airy,\r\nwho always took the liberal side in such questions, was a subscriber\r\nto the fund, and wrote the following letter to the Bishop:\r\n\r\n                                   ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH, S.E.,\r\n                                                    _1865, July 24_.\r\n\r\nMY LORD,\r\n\r\nWith many thanks I have to acknowledge your kind recollection of me in\r\nsending as a presentation copy the work on Joshua, Judges, and\r\nespecially on the divided authorship of Genesis; a work whose\r\ninvestigations, founded in great measure on severe and extensive\r\nverbal criticism, will apparently bear comparison with your Lordship's\r\nmost remarkable examination of Deuteronomy. I should however not do\r\njustice to my own appreciation if I did not remark that there are\r\nother points considered which have long been matters of interest to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOn several matters, some of them important, my present conclusions do\r\nnot absolutely agree with your Lordship's. But I am not the less\r\ngrateful for the amount of erudition and thought carefully directed to\r\ndefinite points, and above all for the noble example of unwearied\r\nresearch and freedom in stating its consequences, in reference to\r\nsubjects which scarcely ever occupy the attention of the clergy in our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n        I am, My Lord,\r\n          Yours very faithfully,\r\n            G.B.

I do not write to tell\r\nyou that I differ from you, but to tell you why I differ.\r\n\r\nI think that you do not make the proper distinction between a person\r\nwho invents or introduces a tool, and the person who uses it.\r\n\r\nThe most resolute antigravitationist that ever lived might yet\r\nacknowledge his debt to Newton for the Method of Prime and Ultimate\r\nRatios and the Principles of Fluxions by which Newton sought to\r\nestablish gravitation.\r\n\r\nSo let it be with Colenso. He has given me a power of tracing out\r\ntruth to a certain extent which I never could have obtained without\r\nhim. And for this I am very grateful.\r\n\r\nAs to the further employment of this power, you know that he and I use\r\nit to totally different purposes. But not the less do I say that I owe\r\nto him a new intellectual power.\r\n\r\nI quite agree with you, that the sudden disruption of the old\r\ntraditional view seems to have unhinged his mind, and to have sent him\r\ntoo far on the other side. I would not give a pin for his judgment.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I wish he would go over the three remaining books of the\r\nTetrateuch.\r\n\r\nI know something of Myers, but I should not have thought him likely to\r\nproduce anything sound on such things as the Hebrew Scriptures.

On various occasions he\r\nsharply criticized the Papers set for the Senate-House Examination and\r\nthe Smith's Prize Examination, and greatly lamented the growing\r\nimportance of pure mathematics and the comparative exclusion of\r\nphysical questions in those examinations. His proposal as finally\r\nsubmitted in the letter that follows was somewhat modified (as regards\r\nthe mode of introducing the subjects) from his original draft, in\r\ndeference to the opinions of Whewell, Adams, Routh, and other friends\r\nto whom he had submitted it. His proposal was favourably received by\r\nthe Mathematical Board, and recommendations were made in the\r\ndirection, though not to the extent, that he desired, and he\r\nsubsequently submitted a Memorandum on those recommendations:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                     _1866, May 11_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, from perusal of the enclosed paper, that I have\r\nacted on the permission which you kindly gave me, to transmit to you\r\nmy proposal for extension of the mathematical education of the\r\nUniversity in the Physical direction.\r\n\r\nIt is an unavoidable consequence of the structure of the University\r\nthat studies there will have a tendency to take an unpractical form\r\ndepending much on the personal tastes of special examiners. I trust\r\nthat, as a person whose long separation from the daily business of the\r\nUniversity has enabled him to see in some measure the wants of the\r\nexternal scientific and practical world, I may be forgiven this\r\nattempt to bring to the notice of the University my ideas on the\r\npoints towards which their attention might perhaps be advantageously\r\nturned.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Very faithfully yours,\r\n            G.B.

Dr Cartmell,\r\n  Master of Christ's College\r\n    and Vice-Chancellor._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                     _1866, May 11_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR VICE-CHANCELLOR,\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, by the kindness of the University, an opportunity\r\nwas presented to me of orally stating what I conceived to be\r\ndeficiencies in the educational course of the University as regards\r\nmathematical physics. Since that time, the consideration of those\r\ndeficiencies, which had long been present to me, has urged itself on\r\nmy attention with greater force: and finally I have entertained the\r\nidea that I might without impropriety communicate to you my opinion,\r\nin a less fugitive form than on the occasion to which I have alluded:\r\nwith the request that, if you should deem such a course appropriate,\r\nyou would bring it before the Board of Mathematical Studies, and\r\nperhaps ultimately make it known to the Resident Members of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nI will first give the list of subjects, which I should wish to see\r\nintroduced, and to the prosecution of which the generally admirable\r\ncourse of the University is remarkably well adapted: and I will then,\r\nwithout entering into every detail, advert to the process by which I\r\nthink it probable the introduction of these subjects could be\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nIn the following list, the first head is purely algebraical, and the\r\nsecond nearly so: but they are closely related to observational\r\nscience, and to the physical subjects which follow. Some of the\r\nsubjects which I exhibit on my list are partially, but in my opinion\r\nimperfectly, taught at present. I entirely omit from my list Physical\r\nOptics, Geometrical Astronomy, and Gravitational Astronomy of Points:\r\nbecause, to the extent to which Academical Education ought to go, I\r\nbelieve that there is no teaching on these sciences comparable to that\r\nin the University of Cambridge. (It is, of course, still possible that\r\nimprovements may be made in the books commonly used.) It might,\r\nhowever, be a question, whether, as regards the time and manner of\r\nteaching them, some parts of these subjects might ultimately be\r\nassociated with the other subjects included in my list.\r\n\r\n        I. _List of subjects proposed for consideration_.\r\n\r\n(1) Partial Differential Equations to the second order, with their\r\narbitrary functions: selected principally with reference to the\r\nphysical subjects.\r\n\r\n(2) The Theory of Probabilities as applied to the combination of\r\nObservations.\r\n\r\n(3) Mechanics (including Hydraulic Powers) in the state which verges\r\nupon practical application, and especially including that part in\r\nwhich the abstract ideas of _power_ and _duty_ occur.\r\n\r\n(4) Attractions. This subject is recognized in the existing course of\r\nthe University: but, so far as I can infer from examination-papers, it\r\nappears to be very lightly passed over.\r\n\r\n(5) The Figure of the Earth, and its consequences, Precession, &c. I\r\nbelieve that the proposal is sanctioned, of adopting some part of this\r\ntheory in the ordinary course; but perhaps hardly so far as is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n(6) The Tides.\r\n\r\n(7) Waves of Water.\r\n\r\n(8) Sound (beginning with Newton's investigation); Echoes; Pipes and\r\nVibrating Strings; Acoustics; the Mathematical part of Music.\r\n\r\n(9) Magnetism, terrestrial and experimental, and their connection.\r\n\r\n(I omit for the present Mineralogy and Mathematical Electricity.)\r\n\r\nThis list of subjects appears formidable: but they are in reality\r\neasy, and would be mastered in a short time by the higher Wranglers.\r\n\r\n  II. _Mode of introducing these subjects into the University_.\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration, and after learning the opinions of several\r\npersons whose judgment claims my deepest respect, I propose the\r\ngradual introduction of these subjects into the Examination for Honors\r\nat admission to the B.A. Degree, as soon as the preparation of Books\r\nand the readiness of Examiners shall enable the University to take\r\nthat step. I conceive that, by a judicious pruning of the somewhat\r\nluxuriant growth of Pure Algebra, Analytical Geometry, and Mere\r\nProblems, sufficient leisure may be gained for the studies of the\r\nundergraduates, and sufficient time for the questions of the\r\nexaminers. I do not contemplate that the students could advance very\r\nfar into the subjects; but I know the importance of beginning them;\r\nand, judging from the train of thoughts, of reading, and of\r\nconversation, among the Bachelors with whom I associated many years\r\nago, I believe that there is quite a sufficient number who will be\r\nanxious to go deep into the subjects if they have once entered into\r\nthem. If six Wranglers annually would take them up, my point would be\r\ngained. The part which these gentlemen might be expected, in a short\r\ntime, to take in the government of the University, would enable them\r\nsoon to act steadily upon the University course: the efficiency of the\r\nUniversity instruction would be increased; and the external character\r\nof the University would be raised.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulties, and they are not light ones, would probably be\r\nfound in providing Examiners and Books. At present, both are wanting\r\nwithin the University. Where there is a great and well-founded\r\nobjection to intrusting examinations to persons foreign to the\r\nUniversity, and where the books have to be created with labour and\r\nwith absolute outlay of money (for their sale could never be\r\nremunerative), the progress must be slow. Still progress would be\r\ncertain, if the authorities of the University should think the matter\r\ndeserving of their hearty encouragement.\r\n\r\nRequesting that you and the Members of the University will accept this\r\nproposal as an indication of my deep attachment to my University,\r\n\r\n        I am,\r\n          My dear Mr Vice-Chancellor,\r\n            Your very faithful servant,\r\n              G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_The Rev. Dr Cartmell,\r\n  &c. &c.\r\n    Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1867\r\n\r\n\"In this year it was arranged that my Treasury accounts were to be\r\ntransferred to the Admiralty, making the simplification which I had so\r\nlong desired.--From the Report to the Visitors it appears that a relic\r\nof the Geodetic operations commenced in 1787 for connecting the\r\nObservatories of Greenwich and Paris, in the shape of an observing\r\ncabin on the roof of the Octagon Room, was shifted and supported in\r\nsuch a manner that the pressure on the flat roof was entirely\r\navoided.--With regard to the Transit Circle, the new Collimators with\r\ntelescopes of seven inches aperture had been mounted. When the Transit\r\nTelescope directed vertically is interposed, the interruptions in the\r\ncentral cube impair the sharpness of definition, still leaving it\r\nabundantly good for general use. It had been regarded as probable that\r\nthe astronomical flexure of the telescope, after cutting away small\r\nportions of the central cube, would be found sensibly changed: and\r\nthis proved to be the case. The difference of flexures of the two ends\r\nhas been altered more than a second of arc.--Referring to a new\r\nPortable Altazimuth which had lately been tested, the Report states as\r\nfollows: 'I may mention that a study of defects in the vertical circle\r\nof a small Altazimuth formerly used by me, and an inspection of the\r\noperations in the instrument-maker's work-shop, have convinced me that\r\nthe principal error to be feared in instruments of this class is\r\novality of the graduated limb; this cannot be eliminated by two\r\nmicroscopes, and such an instrument should never be fitted with two\r\nonly. Our instrument has four.'--'In Osler's Anemometer, a surface of\r\n2 square feet is now exposed to the wind instead of one foot as\r\nformerly; and the plate is supported by weak vertical springs instead\r\nof rods running on rollers. Its indications are much more delicate\r\nthan formerly.'--'The Meteors on Nov. 14th were well observed. Eight\r\nthousand and three hundred were registered. The variations of\r\nfrequency at different times were very well noted. The points of\r\ndivergence were carefully determined.'--Referring to the gradual\r\nimprovement in the steadiness of chronometers from 1851 to 1866, it\r\nappears that from 1851 to 1854 the 'trial number' (which is a\r\ncombination of changes of weekly rate representing the fault of the\r\nchronometer) varied from 34.8s to 52.5s, while from 1862 to 1866 it\r\nvaried from 21.2s to 25.8s.--The following statement will shew the\r\nusual steadiness of the Great Clock on the Westminster Palace: On 38\r\nper cent. of days of observation, the clock's error was below 1s. On\r\n38 per cent, the error was between 1s and 2s. On 21 per cent. it was\r\nbetween 2s and 3s. On 2 per cent. between 3s and 4s. On 1 per cent.\r\nbetween 4s and 5s.--The Report contains an account of the\r\ndetermination of the longitude of Cambridge U.S. by Dr B. A. Gould, by\r\nmeans of galvanic currents through the Atlantic Cable, in the spring\r\nof 1867: and advantage was taken of this opportunity for\r\nre-determining the longitude of Feagh Main near Valencia in\r\nIreland. The longitude of Feagh Main, found by different methods is as\r\nfollows: By chronometers in 1844, 41m 23.23s; by galvanic\r\ncommunication with Knight's Town in 1862, 41m 23.37s; by galvanic\r\ncommunication with Foilhommerum in 1866, 41m 23.19s. The collected\r\nresults for longitude of Cambridge U.S. from different sources are: By\r\nmoon-culminators (Walker in 1851, and Newcomb in 1862-3), 4h 44m\r\n28.42s and 4h 44m 29.56s respectively; by Eclipses (Walker in 1851),\r\n4h 44m 29.64s; by occultations of Pleiades (Peirce 1838-1842, and\r\n1856-1861), 4h 44m 29.91s and 4h 44m 30.90s respectively; by\r\nchronometers (W. C. Bond in 1851, and G. P. Bond in 1855), 4h 44m\r\n30.66s and 4h 44m 31.89s respectively; by Atlantic Cable 1866, 4h 44m\r\n30.99s.--After noticing that many meteorological observatories had\r\nsuddenly sprung up and had commenced printing their observations in\r\ndetail, the Report continues thus: 'Whether the effect of this\r\nmovement will be that millions of useless observations will be added\r\nto the millions that already exist, or whether something may be\r\nexpected to result which will lead to a meteorological theory, I\r\ncannot hazard a conjecture. This only I believe, that it will be\r\nuseless, at present, to attempt a process of mechanical theory; and\r\nthat all that can be done must be, to connect phenomena by laws of\r\ninduction. But the induction must be carried out by numerous and\r\ntroublesome trials in different directions, the greater part of which\r\nwould probably be failures.'--There was this year an annular eclipse;\r\nI made large preparations at the limits of the annularity; failed\r\nentirely from very bad weather.\"--In this year Airy contributed a\r\nPaper to the Institution of Civil Engineers 'On the use of the\r\nSuspension Bridge with stiffened roadway for Railway and other Bridges\r\nof Great Span,' for which a Telford Medal was awarded to him by the\r\nCouncil of the Institution. And he communicated several Papers to the\r\nRoyal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society.\r\n\r\nOf private history: There was the usual visit to Playford in\r\nJanuary.--In April there was a short run to Alnwick and the\r\nneighbourhood, in company with Mr and Mrs Routh.--From June 27th to\r\nJuly 4th he was in Wales with his two eldest sons, visiting Uriconium,\r\n&c. on his return.--From August 8th to Sept. 7th he spent a holiday in\r\nScotland and the Lake District of Cumberland with his daughter\r\nChristabel, visiting the Langtons at Barrow House, near Keswick, and\r\nIsaac Fletcher at Tarn Bank.\r\n\r\nIn June of this year (1867) Airy was elected an Honorary Fellow of his\r\nold College of Trinity in company with Connop Thirlwall, the Bishop of\r\nSt David's. They were the first Honorary Fellows elected by the\r\nCollege. The announcement was made in a letter from the Master of\r\nTrinity (W.H. Thompson), and Airy's reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                 LONDON, S.E.\r\n                                                  _1867, June 12th_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MASTER,\r\n\r\nI am very much gratified by your kind note received this morning,\r\nconveying to me the notice that the Master and Sixteen Senior Fellows\r\nhad elected me, under their new powers, as Honorary Fellow of the\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nIt has always been my wish to maintain a friendly connection with my\r\nCollege, and I am delighted to receive this response from the\r\nCollege. The peculiar form in which the reference to the Statute\r\nenables them to put it renders it doubly pleasing.\r\n\r\nAs the Statute is new, I should be obliged by a copy of it. And, at\r\nany convenient time, I should be glad to know the name of the person\r\nwith whom I am so honorably associated.\r\n\r\n        I am, My dear Master,\r\n          Very faithfully yours,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsequent on Airy's proposals in 1866 for the introduction of new\r\nphysical subjects into the Senate-House Examination and his desire\r\nthat the large number of questions set in Pure Mathematics, or as he\r\ntermed it \"Useless Algebra,\" should be curtailed, there was a smart\r\nand interesting correspondence between him and Prof. Cayley, who was\r\nthe great exponent and advocate of Pure Mathematics at Cambridge. Both\r\nof them were men of the highest mathematical powers, but diametrically\r\nopposed in their views of the use of Mathematics. Airy regarded\r\nmathematics as simply a useful machine for the solution of practical\r\nproblems and arriving at practical results. He had a great respect for\r\nPure Mathematics and all the processes of algebra, so far as they\r\naided him to solve his problems and to arrive at useful results; but\r\nhe had a positive aversion to mathematical investigations, however\r\nskilful and elaborate, for which no immediate practical value could be\r\nclaimed. Cayley on the contrary regarded mathematics as a useful\r\nexercise for the mind, apart from any immediate practical object, and\r\nhe considered that the general command of mathematics gained by\r\nhandling abstruse mathematical investigations (though barren in\r\nthemselves) would be valuable for whatever purpose mathematics might\r\nbe required: he also thought it likely that his researches and\r\nadvances in the field of Pure Mathematics might facilitate the\r\nsolution of physical problems and tend to the progress of the\r\npractical sciences. Their different views on this subject will be\r\nseen from the letters that follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                 LONDON, S.E.\r\n                                                     _1867, Nov. 8_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI think it best to put in writing the purport of what I have said, or\r\nhave intended to say, in reference to the Mathematical Studies in the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nFirst, I will remark on the study of Partial Differential Equations.\r\nI do not know that one branch of Pure Mathematics can be considered\r\nhigher than another, except in the utility of the power which it\r\ngives. Measured thus, the Partial Differential Equations are very\r\nuseful and therefore stand very high, as far as the Second Order.\r\nThey apply, to that point, in the most important way, to the great\r\nproblems of nature concerning _time_, and _infinite division of\r\nmatter_, and _space_: and are worthy of the most careful study. Beyond\r\nthat Order they apply to nothing. It was for the purpose of limiting\r\nthe study to the Second Order, and at the same time working it\r\ncarefully, philosophically, and practically, up to that point, that I\r\ndrew up my little work.\r\n\r\nOn the general question of Mathematical Studies, I will first give my\r\nleading ideas on what I may call the moral part. I think that a heavy\r\nresponsibility rests on the persons who influence most strongly the\r\ncourse of education in the University, to direct that course in the\r\nway in which it will be most useful to the students--in the two ways,\r\nof disciplining their powers and habits, and of giving them scientific\r\nknowledge of the highest and most accurate order (applying to the\r\nphenomena of nature) such as will be useful to them through life. I do\r\nnot think that the mere personal taste of a teacher is sufficient\r\njustification for a special course, unless it has been adopted under a\r\nconsideration of that responsibility. Now I can say for myself that I\r\nhave, for some years, inspected the examination papers, and have\r\nconsidered the bearing of the course which they imply upon the\r\neducation of the student, and am firmly convinced that as regards men\r\nbelow the very few first--say below the ten first--there is a\r\nprodigious loss of time without any permanent good whatever. For the\r\ngreat majority of men, such subjects as abstract Analytical Geometry\r\nperish at once. With men like Adams and Stokes they remain, and are\r\nadvantageous; but probably there is not a single man (beside them) of\r\ntheir respective years who remembers a bit, or who if he remembers\r\nthem has the leisure and other opportunities of applying them.\r\n\r\nI believe on the other hand that a careful selection of physical\r\nsubjects would enable the University to communicate to its students a\r\nvast amount of information; of accurate kind and requiring the most\r\nlogical treatment; but so bearing upon the natural phenomena which are\r\nconstantly before us that it would be felt by every student to possess\r\na real value, that (from that circumstance) it would dwell in his\r\nmind, and that it would enable him to correct a great amount of flimsy\r\neducation in the country, and, so far, to raise the national\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the education of the reasoning habits suggests\r\nideas far from favourable to the existing course. I am old enough to\r\nremember the time of mere geometrical processes, and I do not hesitate\r\nto say that for the cultivation of accurate mental discipline they\r\nwere far superior to the operations in vogue at the present day. There\r\nis no subject in the world more favourable to logical habit than the\r\nDifferential Calculus in all its branches _if logically worked in its\r\nelements_: and I think that its applications to various physical\r\nsubjects, compelling from time to time an attention to the elementary\r\ngrounds of the Calculus, would be far more advantageous to that\r\nlogical habit than the simple applications to Pure Equations and Pure\r\nAlgebraical Geometry now occupying so much attention.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very truly,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_Professor Cayley_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have been intending to answer your letter of the 8th November. So\r\nfar as it is (if at all) personal to myself, I would remark that the\r\nstatutory duty of the Sadlerian Professor is that he shall explain and\r\nteach the principles of Pure Mathematics and apply himself to the\r\nadvancement of the Science.\r\n\r\nAs to Partial Differential Equations, they are \"high\" as being an\r\ninverse problem, and perhaps the most difficult inverse problem that\r\nhas been dealt with. In regard to the limitation of them to the second\r\norder, whatever other reasons exist for it, there is also the reason\r\nthat the theory to this order is as yet so incomplete that there is no\r\ninducement to go beyond it; there could hardly be a more valuable step\r\nthan anything which would give a notion of the form of the general\r\nintegral of a Partial Differential Equation of the second order.\r\n\r\nI cannot but differ from you _in toto_ as to the educational value of\r\nAnalytical Geometry, or I would rather say of Modern Geometry\r\ngenerally. It appears to me that in the Physical Sciences depending on\r\nPartial Differential Equations, there is scarcely anything that a\r\nstudent can do for himself:--he finds the integral of the ordinary\r\nequation for Sound--if he wishes to go a step further and integrate\r\nthe non-linear equation (dy/dx)²(d²y/dt²) = a²(d²y/dx²) he is simply\r\nunable to do so; and so in other cases there is nothing that he can\r\nadd to what he finds in his books. Whereas Geometry (of course to an\r\nintelligent student) is a real inductive and deductive science of\r\ninexhaustible extent, in which he can experiment for himself--the very\r\ntracing of a curve from its equation (and still more the consideration\r\nof the cases belonging to different values of the parameters) is the\r\nconstruction of a theory to bind together the facts--and the selection\r\nof a curve or surface proper for the verification of any general\r\ntheorem is the selection of an experiment in proof or disproof of a\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nI do not quite understand your reference to Stokes and Adams, as types\r\nof the men who alone retain their abstract Analytical Geometry. If a\r\nman when he takes his degree drops mathematics, he drops geometry--but\r\nif not I think for the above reasons that he is more likely to go on\r\nwith it than with almost any other subject--and any mathematical\r\njournal will shew that a very great amount of attention is in fact\r\ngiven to geometry. And the subject is in a very high degree a\r\nprogressive one; quite as much as to Physics, one may apply to it the\r\nlines, Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs, and\r\nthe thoughts of men are widened with the progress of the suns.\r\n\r\n        I remain, dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very sincerely,\r\n            A. CAYLEY.\r\n\r\n  CAMBRIDGE,\r\n    _6 Dec., 1867_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                 LONDON, S.E.\r\n                                                 _1867, December 9_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have received with much pleasure your letter of December 6. In this\r\nUniversity discussion, I have acted only in public, and have not made\r\nprivate communication to any person whatever till required to do so by\r\nprivate letter addressed to me. Your few words in Queens' Hall seemed\r\nto expect a little reply.\r\n\r\nNow as to the Modern Geometry. With your praises of this science--as\r\nto the room for extension in induction and deduction, &c.; and with\r\nyour facts--as to the amount of space which it occupies in\r\nMathematical Journals; I entirely agree. And if men, after leaving\r\nCambridge, were designed to shut themselves up in a cavern, they could\r\nhave nothing better for their subjective amusement. They might have\r\nother things as good; enormous complication and probably beautiful\r\ninvestigation might be found in varying the game of billiards with\r\nnovel islands on a newly shaped billiard table. But the persons who\r\ndevote themselves to these subjects do thereby separate themselves\r\nfrom the world. They make no step towards natural science or\r\nutilitarian science, the two subjects which the world specially\r\ndesires. The world could go on as well without these separatists.\r\n\r\nNow if these persons lived only for themselves, no other person would\r\nhave any title to question or remark on their devotion to this barren\r\nsubject. But a Cambridge Examiner is not in that position. The\r\nUniversity is a national body, for education of young men: and the\r\npower of a Cambridge Examiner is omnipotent in directing the education\r\nof the young men; and his responsibility to the cause of education is\r\nvery distinct and very strong. And the question for him to consider\r\nis--in the sense in which mathematical education is desired by the\r\nbest authorities in the nation, is the course taken by this national\r\ninstitution satisfactory to the nation?\r\n\r\nI express my belief that it is _not_ satisfactory. I believe that many\r\nof the best men of the nation consider that a great deal of time is\r\nlost on subjects which they esteem as puerile, and that much of that\r\ntime might be employed on noble and useful science.\r\n\r\nYou may remember that the Commissions which have visited Cambridge\r\noriginated in a Memorial addressed to the Government by men of\r\nrespected scientific character: Sabine was one, and I may take him as\r\nthe representative. He is a man of extensive knowledge of the\r\napplication of mathematics as it has been employed for many years in\r\nthe science of the world; but he has no profundity of science. He, as\r\nI believe, desired to find persons who could enter accurately into\r\nmathematical science, and naturally looked to the Great Mathematical\r\nUniversity; but he must have been much disappointed. So much time is\r\nswallowed up by the forced study of the Pure Mathematics that it is\r\nnot easy to find anybody who can really enter on these subjects in\r\nwhich men of science want assistance. And so Sabine thought that the\r\nGovernment ought to interfere, probably without any clear idea of what\r\nthey could do.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very truly,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_Professor Cayley_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for your last letter. I do not think everything\r\nshould be subordinated to the educational element: my idea of a\r\nUniversity is that of a place for the cultivation of all\r\nscience. Therefore among other sciences Pure Mathematics; including\r\nwhatever is interesting as part of this science. I am bound therefore\r\nto admit that your proposed extension of the problem of billiards, _if\r\nit_ were found susceptible of interesting mathematical developments,\r\nwould be a fit subject of study. But in this case I do not think the\r\nproblem could fairly be objected to as puerile--a more legitimate\r\nobjection would I conceive be its extreme speciality. But this is not\r\nan objection that can be brought against Modern Geometry as a whole:\r\nin regard to any particular parts of it which may appear open to such\r\nan objection, the question is whether they are or are not, for their\r\nown sakes, or their bearing upon other parts of the science to which\r\nthey belong, worthy of being entered upon and pursued.\r\n\r\nBut admitting (as I do not) that Pure Mathematics are only to be\r\nstudied with a view to Natural and Physical Science, the question\r\nstill arises how are they best to be studied in that view. I assume\r\nand admit that as to a large part of Modern Geometry and of the Theory\r\nof Numbers, there is no present probability that these will find any\r\nphysical applications. But among the remaining parts of Pure\r\nMathematics we have the theory of Elliptic Functions and of the\r\nJacobian and Abelian Functions, and the theory of Differential\r\nEquations, including of course Partial Differential Equations. Now\r\ntaking for instance the problem of three bodies--unless this is to be\r\ngone on with by the mere improvement in detail of the present\r\napproximate methods--it is at least conceivable that the future\r\ntreatment of it will be in the direction of the problem of two fixed\r\ncentres, by means of elliptic functions, &c.; and that the discovery\r\nwill be made not by searching for it directly with the mathematical\r\nresources now at our command, but by \"prospecting\" for it in the field\r\nof these functions. Even improvements in the existing methods are more\r\nlikely to arise from a study of differential equations in general than\r\nfrom a special one of the equations of the particular problem: the\r\nmaterials for such improvements which exist in the writings of\r\nHamilton, Jacobi, Bertrand, and Bour, have certainly so arisen. And\r\nthe like remarks would apply to the physical problems which depend on\r\nPartial Differential Equations.\r\n\r\nI think that the course of mathematical study at the University is\r\nlikely to be a better one if regulated with a view to the cultivation\r\nof Science, as if for its own sake, rather than directly upon\r\nconsiderations of what is educationally best (I mean that the best\r\neducational course will be so obtained), and that we have thus a\r\njustification for a thorough study of Pure Mathematics. In my own\r\nlimited experience of examinations, the fault which I find with the\r\nmen is a want of analytical power, and that whatever else may have\r\nbeen in defect Pure Mathematics has certainly not been in excess.\r\n\r\n        I remain, dear Sir,\r\n          Yours sincerely,\r\n            A. CAYLEY.\r\n\r\n  CAMBRIDGE,\r\n    _10th Dec., 1867_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                _1867, December 17_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nSince receiving your letter of 9th I positively have not had time to\r\nexpress the single remark which I proposed to make on it.\r\n\r\nYou state your idea that the educational element ought not to be the\r\npredominating element in the University. \"I do not think that every\r\nthing should be subordinated to the educational element.\" I cannot\r\nconceal my surprise at this sentiment. Assuredly the founders of the\r\nColleges intended them for education (so far as they apply to persons\r\nin statu pupillari), the statutes of the University and the Colleges\r\nare framed for education, and fathers send their sons to the\r\nUniversity for education. If I had not had your words before me, I\r\nshould have said that it is impossible to doubt this.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be desired that Professors and others who exercise no\r\ncontrol by force should take every method, not only of promoting\r\nscience in themselves, but also of placing the promoted science before\r\nstudents: and it is much to be desired that students who have passed\r\nthe compulsory curriculum should be encouraged to proceed into the\r\nnovelties which will be most agreeable to them. But this is a totally\r\ndifferent thing from using the Compulsory Force of Examination to\r\ndrive students in paths traced only by the taste of the examiner. For\r\nthem, I conceive the obligation to the nation and the duty to follow\r\nthe national sense on education (as far as it can be gathered from its\r\nbest representatives) to be undoubted; and to be, in the intensity of\r\nthe obligation and duty, most serious.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very truly,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_Professor Cayley_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1868\r\n\r\n\"In the South-East Dome, the alteration proposed last year for\r\nrendering the building fire-proof had been completely carried out. The\r\nmiddle room, which was to be appropriated to Chronometers, was being\r\nfitted up accordingly.--From the Report it appears that 'our\r\nsubterranean telegraph wires were all broken by one blow, from an\r\naccident in the Metropolitan Drainage Works on Groom's Hill, but were\r\nspeedily repaired.'--In my office as Chairman of successive\r\nCommissions on Standards, I had collected a number of Standards, some\r\nof great historical value (as Ramsden's and Roy's Standards of Length,\r\nKater's Scale-beam for weighing great weights, and others), &c. These\r\nhave been transferred to the newly-created Standards Department of the\r\nBoard of Trade.\"--In the Report is given a detailed account of the\r\nsystem of preserving and arranging the manuscripts and correspondence\r\nof the Observatory, which was always regarded by Airy as a matter of\r\nthe first importance.--From a careful discussion of the results of\r\nobservation Mr Stone had concluded that the refractions ought to be\r\ndiminished. 'Relying on this, we have now computed our mean\r\nrefractions by diminishing those of Bessel's Fundamenta in the\r\nproportion of 1 to 0.99797.'--The Magnetometer-Indications for the\r\nperiod 1858-1863 had been reduced and discussed, with remarkable\r\nresults. It is inferred that magnetic disturbances, both solar and\r\nlunar, are produced mediately by the Earth, and that the Earth in\r\nperiods of several years undergoes changes which fit it and unfit it\r\nfor exercising a powerful mediate action.--The Earth-current records\r\nhad been reduced, and the magnetic effect which the currents would\r\nproduce had been computed. The result was, that the agreement between\r\nthe magnetic effects so computed and the magnetic disturbances really\r\nrecorded by the magnetometers was such as to leave no doubt on the\r\ngeneral validity of the explanation of the great storm-disturbances of\r\nthe magnets as consequences of the galvanic currents through the\r\nearth.--Referring to the difficulty experienced in making the\r\nmeteorological observations practically available the Report states\r\nthus: 'The want of Meteorology, at the present time, is principally in\r\nsuggestive theory.'--In this year Airy communicated to the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society a Paper 'On the Preparatory Arrangements for the\r\nObservation of the Transits of Venus 1874 and 1882': this subject was\r\nnow well in hand.--The First Report of the Commissioners (of whom he\r\nwas Chairman) appointed to enquire into the condition of the Exchequer\r\nStandards was printed: this business took up much time.--He was in\r\nthis year much engaged on the Coinage Commission.\r\n\r\nOf private history: There was the usual winter visit to Playford, and\r\na short visit to Cambridge in June.--From about Aug. 1st to Sept. 3rd\r\nhe was travelling in Switzerland with his youngest son and his two\r\nyoungest daughters. In the course of this journey they visited\r\nZermatt. There had been much rain, the rivers were greatly flooded,\r\nand much mischief was done to the roads. During the journey from Visp\r\nto Zermatt, near St Nicholas, in a steep part of the gorge, a large\r\nstone rolled from the cliffs and knocked their baggage horse over the\r\nlower precipice, a fall of several hundred feet. The packages were all\r\nburst, and many things were lost, but a good deal was recovered by men\r\nsuspended by ropes.\r\n\r\nIn this year also Airy was busy with the subject of University\r\nExamination, which in previous years had occupied so much of his\r\nattention, as will be seen from the following letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                 LONDON, S.E.\r\n                                                   _1868, March 12_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MASTER,\r\n\r\nI have had the pleasure of corresponding with you on matters of\r\nUniversity Examination so frequently that I at once turn to you as the\r\nproper person to whom I may address any remarks on that important\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nCircumstances have enabled me lately to obtain private information of\r\na most accurate kind on the late Mathematical Tripos: and among other\r\nthings, I have received a statement of every individual question\r\nanswered or partly answered by five honour-men. I have collected the\r\nnumbers of these in a small table which I enclose.\r\n\r\nI am struck with the _almost_ nugatory character of the five days'\r\nhonour examination as applied to Senior Optimes, and I do not doubt\r\nthat it is _totally_ nugatory as applied to Junior Optimes. It appears\r\nto me that, for all that depends on these days, the rank of the\r\nOptimes is mere matter of chance.\r\n\r\nIn the examinations of the Civil Service, the whole number of marks is\r\npublished, and also the number of marks gained by each candidate. I\r\nhave none of their papers at hand, but my impression is that the\r\nlowest candidates make about 1 in 3; and the fair candidates about 2\r\nin 3, instead of 1 in 10 or 1 in 13 as our good Senior Optimes.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Master,\r\n          Very truly yours,\r\n            G.B.

It is much opposed by private tutors,\r\nexaminers and others, and may possibly be thrown out in the Senate\r\nthis year, though I hope that with a little patience it may be\r\ncarried, in an unmutilated form, eventually.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed Report on the Smith's Prize Examination will be discussed\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nI will consider what is best to be done on the subject to which your\r\nnote refers, without delay. With many thanks,\r\n\r\n        I am,\r\n          Very faithfully yours,\r\n            H.W. COOKSON,\r\n\r\n_The Astronomer Royal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this year certain Members of the Senate of the University of\r\nCambridge petitioned Parliament against the abolition of religious\r\ndeclarations required of persons admitted to Fellowships or proceeding\r\nto the degree of M.A. The document was sent to Airy for his signature,\r\nand his reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                 LONDON, S.E.\r\n                                                   _1868, March 18_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThough I sympathize to a great extent with the prayer of the petition\r\nto Parliament which you sent to me yesterday, and assent to most of\r\nthe reasons, I do not attach my signature to it, for the following\r\nconsiderations:\r\n\r\n1. I understand, from the introductory clause, and from the\r\nunqualified character of the phrase \"any such measures\" in the second\r\nclause, that the petition objects to granting the M.A. degree without\r\nreligious declaration. I do not see any adequate necessity for this\r\nobjection, and I cannot join in it.\r\n\r\n2. It appears to me that the Colleges were intended for two collateral\r\nobjects:--instruction by part of the Fellows, on a religious basis;\r\nand support of certain Fellows for scientific purposes, without the\r\nsame ostentatious connection with religion. I like this spirit well,\r\nand should be glad to maintain it.\r\n\r\n3. I therefore think (as I have publicly stated before) that the\r\nMaster of the College ought to be in holy orders; and so ought those\r\nof the Fellows who may be expected to be usually resident and to take\r\ncontinuous part in the instruction. But there are many who, upon\r\ntaking a fellowship, at once lay aside all thoughts of this: and I\r\nthink that such persons ought not to be trammelled with declarations.\r\n\r\n4. My modification of existing regulations, if it once got into shape,\r\nwould I dare say be but a small fraction of that proposed by the\r\n\"measures in contemplation.\" Still I do not like to join in\r\nunqualified resistance to interference in the affairs of the\r\nEstablished Colleges, with that generality of opposition to\r\ninterference which the petition seems to intimate.\r\n\r\nI agree with articles 3, 4, and 5; and I am pleased with the graceful\r\nallusion in article 4 to the assistance which has been rendered by the\r\nColleges, and by none perhaps so honourably as Trinity, to the\r\nparishes connected with it. And I could much wish that the spirit of 3\r\nand 5 could be carried out, with some concession to my ideas in _my_\r\nparagraph 3, above.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very truly,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_Rev. Dr Lightfoot._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1869\r\n\r\nFrom the Report to the Board of Visitors it appears that application\r\nhad been made for an extension of the grounds of the Observatory to a\r\ndistance of 100 feet south of the Magnetic Ground, and that a Warrant\r\nfor the annexation of this space was signed on 1868, Dec. 8. The new\r\nDepôt for the Printed Productions of the Observatory had been\r\ntransferred to its position in the new ground, and the foundations for\r\nthe Great Shed were completed.--\"The courses of our wires for the\r\nregistration of spontaneous terrestrial galvanic currents have been\r\nentirely changed. The lines to Croydon and Deptford are abandoned; and\r\nfor these are substituted, a line from Angerstein Wharf to Lady Well\r\nStation, and a line from North Kent Junction to Morden College\r\nTunnel. At each of these points the communication with Earth is made\r\nby a copper plate 2 feet square. The straight line connecting the\r\nextreme points of the first station intersects that connecting the two\r\npoints of the second station, nearly at right angles, and at little\r\ndistance from the Observatory.--The question of dependence of the\r\nmeasurable amount of sidereal aberration upon the thickness of glass\r\nor other transparent material in the telescope (a question which\r\ninvolves, theoretically, one of the most delicate points in the\r\nUndulatory Theory of Light) has lately been agitated on the Continent\r\nwith much earnestness. I have calculated the curvatures of the lenses\r\nof crown and flint glass (the flint being exterior) for correcting\r\nspherical and chromatic aberration in a telescope whose tube is filled\r\nwith water, and have instructed Mr Simms to proceed with the\r\npreparation of an instrument carrying such a telescope. I have not\r\nfinally decided whether to rely on Zenith-distances of gamma Draconis\r\nor on right-ascensions of Polaris. In any form the experiment will\r\nprobably be troublesome.--The transit of Mercury on 1868, Nov. 4th,\r\nwas observed by six observers. The atmospheric conditions were\r\nfavourable; and the singular appearances usually presented in a\r\nplanetary transit were well seen.--Mr Stone has attached to the\r\nSouth-East Equatoreal a thermo-multiplier, with the view of examining\r\nwhether heat radiating from the principal stars can be made sensible\r\nin our instruments. The results hitherto obtained are encouraging, but\r\nthey shew clearly that it is vain to attempt this enquiry except in\r\nthe most superb weather; and there has not been a night deserving that\r\nepithet for some months past.--The preparations for observing the\r\nTransits of Venus were now begun in earnest. I had come to the\r\nconclusion, that after every reliance was placed on foreign and\r\ncolonial observatories, it would be necessary for the British\r\nGovernment to undertake the equipment of five or six temporary\r\nstations. On Feb. 15th I sent a pamphlet on the subject to Mr Childers\r\n(First Lord of Admiralty), and in April I wrote to the Secretary,\r\nasking authority for the purchase of instruments. On June 22nd\r\nauthority is given to me for the instruments: the Treasury assent to\r\n_£10,500_. On August 9th I had purchased 3 equatoreals.--I have given\r\na short course of Lectures in the University of Cambridge on the\r\nsubject of Magnetism, with the view of introducing that important\r\nphysical science into the studies of the University. The want of books\r\navailable to Students, and the novelty of the subject, made the\r\npreparation more laborious than the duration of the lectures would\r\nseem to imply.\"--In this year there was much work on the Standards\r\nCommission, chiefly regarding the suggested abolition of Troy Weight,\r\nand several Papers on the subject were prepared by Airy.--He also\r\nwrote a long and careful description of the Great Equatoreal at\r\nGreenwich.\r\n\r\nOf private history: There was the usual visit to Playford in the\r\nwinter. Mrs Airy was now becoming feebler, and did not now leave\r\nGreenwich: since April of this year her letters were written in\r\npencil, and with difficulty, but she still made great efforts to keep\r\nup the accustomed correspondence.--In April Airy went to Cambridge to\r\ndeliver his lectures on magnetism to the undergraduates: the following\r\npassage occurs in one of his letters at this time: \"I have a mighty\r\nattendance (there were 147 names on my board yesterday), and, though\r\nthe room is large with plenty of benches, I have been obliged to bring\r\nin some chairs. The men are exceedingly attentive, and when I look up\r\nI am quite struck to see the number of faces staring into mine. I go\r\nat 12, and find men at the room copying from my big papers: I lecture\r\nfrom 1 to 2, and stop till after 3, and through the last hour some men\r\nare talking to me and others are copying from the papers; and I\r\nusually leave some men still at work. The men applaud and shew their\r\nrespect very gracefully. There are present some two or three persons\r\nwho attended my former lectures, and they say that I lecture exactly\r\nas I did formerly. One of my attendants is a man that they say cannot,\r\nfrom years and infirmity and habit, be induced to go anywhere else: Dr\r\nArchdall, the Master of Emmanuel. I find that some of my old\r\nlecturing habits come again on me. I drink a great deal of cold water,\r\nand am very glad to go to bed early.\"--From June 10th-30th he was\r\ntravelling in Scotland, and staying at Barrow House near Keswick (the\r\nresidence of Mr Langton), with his son Hubert.--Subsequently, from\r\nAug. 17th to 31st, he was again in the Lake District, with his\r\ndaughter Christabel, and was joined there by his son Hubert on the\r\n24th. The first part of the time was spent at Tarn Bank, near\r\nCarlisle, the residence of Mr Isaac Fletcher, M.P. From thence he made\r\nseveral expeditions, especially to Barrow in Furness and Seascale,\r\nwhere he witnessed with great interest the Bessemer process of making\r\nsteel. From Barrow House he made continual excursions among the\r\nCumberland mountains, which he knew so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1870\r\n\r\n\"In this year Mr Stone, the First Assistant, was appointed to the Cape\r\nof Good Hope Observatory, and resigned his post of First Assistant. Mr\r\nChristie was appointed in his place.--From the Report to the Visitors\r\nit appears that 'A few months since we were annoyed by a failure in\r\nthe illumination of the field of view of the Transit Circle. The\r\nreflector was cleaned, but in vain; at last it was discovered that one\r\nof the lenses (the convex lens) of the combination which forms the\r\nobject-glass of a Reversed Telescope in the interior of the\r\nTransit-axis, and through which all illuminating light must pass, had\r\nbecome so corroded as to be almost opaque.'--The South-East Equatoreal\r\nhas been partly occupied with the thermo-multiplier employed by Mr\r\nStone for the measure of heat radiating from the principal stars. Mr\r\nStone's results for the radiation from Arcturus and alpha Lyrae appear\r\nto be incontrovertible, and to give bases for distinct numerical\r\nestimation of the radiant heat of these stars.--In my last Report I\r\nalluded to a proposed systematic reduction of the meteorological\r\nobservations during the whole time of their efficient\r\nself-registration. Having received from the Admiralty the funds\r\nnecessary for immediate operations, I have commenced with the\r\nphotographic registers of the thermometers, dry-bulb and wet-bulb,\r\nfrom 1848 to 1868.--Our chronometer-room contains at present 219\r\nchronometers, including 37 chronometers which have been placed here by\r\nchronometer-makers as competing for the honorary reputation and the\r\npecuniary advantages to be derived from success in the half-year's\r\ntrial to which they are subjected. I take this opportunity of stating\r\nthat I have uniformly advocated the policy of offering good prices for\r\nthe chronometers of great excellence, and that I have given much\r\nattention to the decision on their merits; and I am convinced that\r\nthis system has greatly contributed to the remarkably steady\r\nimprovement in the performance of chronometers. In the trial which\r\nterminated in August 1869, the best chronometers (taking as usual the\r\naverage of the first six) were superior in merit to those of any\r\npreceding year.--With the funds placed at my disposal for the Transit\r\nof Venus 1874 I purchased three 6-inch equatoreals, and have ordered\r\ntwo: I have also ordered altazimuths (with accurate vertical circles\r\nonly), and clocks sufficient, as I expect, to equip five stations. For\r\nmethods of observation, I rely generally on the simple\r\neye-observation, possibly relieved of some of its uncertainty by the\r\nuse of my colour-correcting eyepiece. But active discussion has taken\r\nplace on the feasibility of using photographic and spectroscopic\r\nmethods; and it will not be easy for some time to announce that the\r\nplan of observations is settled.--There can be no doubt, I imagine,\r\nthat the first and necessary duty of the Royal Observatory is to\r\nmaintain its place well as an Observing Establishment; and that this\r\nmust be secured, at whatever sacrifice, if necessary, of other\r\npursuits. Still the question has not unfrequently presented itself to\r\nme, whether the duties to which I allude have not, by force of\r\ncircumstances, become too exclusive; and whether the cause of Science\r\nmight not gain if, as in the Imperial Observatory of Paris for\r\ninstance, the higher branches of mathematical physics should not take\r\ntheir place by the side of Observatory routine. I have often felt the\r\ndesire practically to refresh my acquaintance with what were once\r\nfavourite subjects: Lunar Theory and Physical Optics. But I do not at\r\npresent clearly see how I can enter upon them with that degree of\r\nfreedom of thought which is necessary for success in abstruse\r\ninvestigations.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: There was a longer visit than usual to Playford,\r\nlasting till Jan. 27th.--In April he made a short excursion (of less\r\nthan a week) with his son Hubert to Monmouth, &c.--From June 14th to\r\nJuly 2nd he was staying at Barrow House, near Keswick, with his son\r\nHubert: during this time he was much troubled with a painful\r\nskin-irritation of his leg and back, which lasted in some degree for a\r\nlong time afterwards.--From Sept. 25th to Oct. 6th he made an\r\nexcursion with his daughter Christabel to Scarborough, Whitby, &c.,\r\nand again spent a few days at Barrow House.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1871\r\n\r\n\"In April 1870 the Assistants had applied for an increase of salary, a\r\nrequest which I had urged strongly upon the Admiralty. On Jan. 27 of\r\nthis year the Admiralty answered that, on account of Mr Childers's\r\nillness, the consideration must be deferred to next year! The\r\nAssistants wrote bitterly to me: and with my sanction they wrote to\r\nthe First Lord. On Jan. 31st I requested an interview with Mr Baxter\r\n(secretary of the Admiralty), and saw him on Feb. 3rd, when I obtained\r\nhis consent to an addition of _£530_. There was still a difficulty\r\nwith the Treasury, but on June 27th the liberal scale was\r\nallowed.--Experiments made by Mr Stone shew clearly that a local\r\nelevation, like that of the Royal Observatory on the hill of Greenwich\r\nPark, has no tendency to diminish the effect of railway tremors.--The\r\ncorrection for level error in the Transit Circle having become\r\ninconveniently large, a sheet of very thin paper, 1/270 inch in\r\nthickness, was placed under the eastern Y, which was raised from its\r\nbed for the purpose. The mean annual value of the level-error appears\r\nto be now sensibly zero.--As the siege and war operations in Paris\r\nseriously interfered with the observations of small planets made at\r\nthe Paris Observatory, observations of them were continued at\r\nGreenwich throughout each entire lunation during the investment of the\r\ncity.--The new Water-Telescope has been got into working order, and\r\nperforms most satisfactorily. Observations of gamma Draconis have been\r\nmade with it, when the star passed between 20h and 17h, with some\r\nobservations for adjustment at a still more advanced time. As the\r\nastronomical latitude of the place of observation is not known, the\r\nbearing of these observations on the question of aberration cannot be\r\ncertainly pronounced until the autumn observations shall have been\r\nmade; but supposing the geodetic latitude to be accordant with the\r\nastronomical latitude, the result for aberration appears to be\r\nsensibly the same as with ordinary telescopes.--Several years since, I\r\nprepared a barometer, by which the barometric fluctuations were\r\nenlarged, for the information of the public; its indications are\r\nexhibited on the wall, near to the entrance gate of the Observatory. A\r\ncard is now also exhibited, in a glass case near the public barometer,\r\ngiving the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer in the\r\npreceding twenty-four hours.--Those who have given attention to the\r\nhistory of Terrestrial Magnetism are aware that Halley's Magnetic\r\nChart is very frequently cited; but I could not learn that any person,\r\nat least in modern times, had seen it. At last I discovered a copy in\r\nthe library of the British Museum, and have been allowed to take\r\ncopies by photolithography. These are appended to the Magnetical and\r\nMeteorological Volume for 1869.--The trials and certificates of\r\nhand-telescopes for the use of the Royal Navy have lately been so\r\nfrequent that they almost become a regular part of the work of the\r\nObservatory. I may state here that by availing myself of a theory of\r\neyepieces which I published long since in the Cambridge Transactions,\r\nI have been able to effect a considerable improvement in the\r\ntelescopes furnished to the Admiralty.--The occurrence of the Total\r\nEclipse of the Sun in December last has brought much labour upon the\r\nObservatory. As regards the assistants and computers, the actual\r\nobservation on a complicated plan with the Great Equatoreal (a plan\r\nfor which few equatoreals are sufficiently steady, but which when\r\nproperly carried out gives a most complete solution of the geometrical\r\nproblem) has required, in observation and in computation, a large\r\nexpenditure of time.--My preparations for the Transit of Venus have\r\nrespect only to eye-observation of contact of limbs. With all the\r\nliabilities and defects to which it is subject, this method possesses\r\nthe inestimable advantage of placing no reliance on instrumental\r\nscales. I hope that the error of observation may not exceed four\r\nseconds of time, corresponding to about 0.13\" of arc. I shall be very\r\nglad to see, in a detailed form, a plan for making the proper measures\r\nby heliometric or photographic apparatus; and should take great\r\ninterest in combining these with the eye-observations, if my selected\r\nstations can be made available. But my present impression is one of\r\ndoubt on the certainty of equality of parts in the scale employed. An\r\nerror depending on this cause could not be diminished by any\r\nrepetition of observations.\"--After referring to the desirability of\r\nvigorously prosecuting the Meteorological Reductions (already begun)\r\nand of discussing the Magnetic Observations, the Report concludes\r\nthus: \"There is another consideration which very often presents itself\r\nto my mind; the waste of labour in the repetition of observations at\r\ndifferent observatories..... I think that this consideration ought not\r\nto be put out of sight in planning the courses of different\r\nObservatories.\"--In this year De Launay's Lunar Theory was\r\npublished. This valuable work was of great service to Airy in the\r\npreparation of the Numerical Lunar Theory, which he subsequently\r\nundertook.--In the latter part of this year Airy was elected President\r\nof the Royal Society, and held the office during 1872 and 1873. At\r\nthis time he was much pressed with work, and could ill afford to take\r\nup additional duties, as the following quotation from a letter to one\r\nof his friends shews: \"The election to the Presidency of R.S. is\r\nflattering, and has brought to me the friendly remembrances of many\r\npersons; but in its material and laborious connections, I could well\r\nhave dispensed with it, and should have done so but for the respectful\r\nway in which it was pressed on me.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: There was the usual winter visit to Playford.--In\r\nApril he made a short trip to Cornwall with his daughter Annot.--In\r\nJune he was appointed a Companion of the Bath, and was presented at\r\nCourt on his appointment.--Mrs Airy was staying with her daughter, Mrs\r\nRouth, at Hunstanton, during June, her state of health being somewhat\r\nimproved.--From August 1st to 28th he was chiefly in Cumberland, at\r\nBarrow House, and at Grange, Borrowdale, where his son Osmund was\r\nstaying for a holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1872\r\n\r\n\"From the Report to the Board of Visitors it appears that 'The Normal\r\nSiderial Clock for giving sidereal time by galvanic communication to\r\nthe Astronomical Observatory was established in the Magnetic Basement\r\nin 1871, June; that locality being adapted for it on account of the\r\nuniformity of temperature, the daily changed of temperature rarely\r\nexceeding 1° Fahrenheit. Its escapement is one which I suggested many\r\nyears ago in the Cambridge Transactions; a detached escapement, very\r\nclosely analogous to the ordinary chronometer escapement, the pendulum\r\nreceiving an impulse only at alternate vibrations.... The steadiness\r\nof rate is very far superior to any that we have previously\r\nattained.'--The aspect of railway enterprise is at present favourable\r\nto the Park and to the Observatory. The South-Eastern Railway Company\r\nhas made an arrangement with the Metropolitan Board of Works for\r\nshifting the course of the great Southern Outfall Sewer. This enables\r\nthe Company to trace a new line for the railway, passing on the north\r\nside of London Street, at such a distance from the Observatory as to\r\nremove all cause of alarm. I understand that the Bill, which was\r\nunopposed, has passed the Committee of the House of Commons. I trust\r\nthat the contest, which has lasted thirty-seven years, is now\r\nterminated.--The observations of 7 Draconis with the Water-Telescope,\r\nmade in the autumn of 1871, and the spring of 1872, are reduced, the\r\nlatter only in their first steps.... Using the values of the level\r\nscales as determined by Mr Simms (which I have no reason to believe to\r\nbe inaccurate) the spring and autumn observations of 1871 absolutely\r\nnegative the idea of any effect being produced on the constant of\r\naberration by the amount of refracting medium traversed by the\r\nlight.--The great Aurora of 1872 Feb. 4 was well observed. On this\r\noccasion the term Borealis would have been a misnomer, for the\r\nphenomenon began in the South and was most conspicuous in the\r\nSouth. Three times in the evening it exhibited that umbrella-like\r\nappearance which has been called (perhaps inaccurately) a corona. I\r\nhave very carefully compared its momentary phenomena with the\r\ncorresponding movements of the magnetometers. In some of the most\r\ncritical times, the comparison fails on account of the violent\r\nmovements and consequent faint traces of the magnetometers. I have not\r\nbeen able to connect the phases of aurora and those of magnetic\r\ndisturbance very distinctly.--The Report contains a detailed account\r\nof the heavy preparations for the observation of the Transit of Venus\r\n1874, including the portable buildings for the instruments, the\r\ninstruments themselves (being a transit-instrument, an altazimuth, and\r\nan equatoreal, for each station), and first class and second-class\r\nclocks, all sufficient for the equipment of 5 stations, and continues\r\nthus: I was made aware of the assent of the Government to the wish of\r\nthe Board of Visitors, as expressed at their last meeting, that\r\nprovision should be made for the application of photography to the\r\nobservation of the Transit of Venus. It is unnecessary for me to\r\nremark that our hope of success is founded entirely on our confidence\r\nin Mr De La Rue. Under his direction, Mr Dallmeyer has advanced far in\r\nthe preparation of five photoheliographs.... The subject is recognized\r\nby many astronomers as not wholly free from difficulties, but it is\r\ngenerally believed that these difficulties may be overcome, and Mr De\r\nLa Rue is giving careful attention to the most important of them.--I\r\ntake this opportunity of reporting to the Board that the Observatory\r\nwas honoured by a visit of His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, who\r\nminutely examined every part.\"--After referring to various subjects\r\nwhich in his opinion might be usefully pursued systematically at the\r\nObservatory, the Report proceeds thus: \"'The character of the\r\nObservatory would be somewhat changed by this innovation, but not, as\r\nI imagine, in a direction to which any objection can be made. It would\r\nbecome, pro tanto, a physical observatory; and possibly in time its\r\noperations might be extended still further in a physical\r\ndirection.'--The consideration of possible changes in the future of\r\nthe Observatory leads me to the recollection of actual changes in the\r\npast. In my Annual Reports to the Visitors I have endeavoured to\r\nchronicle these; but still there will be many circumstances which at\r\npresent are known only to myself, but which ought not to be beyond the\r\nreach of history. I have therefore lately employed some time in\r\ndrawing up a series of skeleton annals of the Observatory (which\r\nunavoidably partakes in some measure of the form of biography), and\r\nhave carried it through the critical period, 1836-1851. If I should\r\ncommand sufficient leisure to bring it down to 1861, I think that I\r\nmight then very well stop.\" (The skeleton annals here referred to are\r\nundoubtedly the manuscript notes which form the basis of the present\r\nbiography. Ed.)--\"On Feb. 23rd in this year I first (privately) formed\r\nthe notion of preparing a numerical Lunar Theory by substituting\r\nDelaunay's numbers in the proper Equations and seeing what would come\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: There was the usual visit to Playford--in this\r\nyear later than usual--from Feb. 4th to Mar. 4th. The letters written\r\nduring this visit are, as usual, full of freshness and delight at\r\nfinding himself in his favourite country village.--On June 5th he went\r\nto Barrow House, near Keswick, to be present at the marriage of his\r\nsecond son Hubert to Miss S. C. Langton, daughter of Z. Langton Esq.,\r\nof Barrow House.--After the wedding he made a trip through the\r\nTrossachs district of Scotland with his daughter Annot, and returned\r\nto Greenwich on June 17th.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th June 1872 Airy was appointed a Knight Commander of the\r\nMost Honourable Order of the Bath: he was knighted by the Queen at\r\nOsborne on the 30th of July. In the course of his official career he\r\nhad three times been offered Knighthood, and had each time declined\r\nit: but it seemed now as if his scruples on the subject were removed,\r\nand it is probable that he felt gratified by the public recognition of\r\nhis services. Of course the occasion produced many letters of\r\ncongratulation from his friends: to one of these he replied as\r\nfollows: \"The real charm of these public compliments seems to be, that\r\nthey excite the sympathies and elicit the kind expressions of private\r\nfriends or of official superiors as well as subordinates. In every way\r\nI have derived pleasure from these.\" From the Assistants of the Royal\r\nObservatory he received a hearty letter of congratulation containing\r\nthe following paragraph. \"Our position has naturally given us peculiar\r\nopportunities for perceiving the high and broad purposes which have\r\ncharacterized your many and great undertakings, and of witnessing the\r\nuntiring zeal and self-denial with which they have been pursued.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of March 1872 Airy was nominated a Foreign Associate of\r\nthe Institut de France, to fill the place vacant by the death of Sir\r\nJohn Herschel. The following letter of acknowledgment shews how much\r\nhe was gratified by this high scientific honour:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                   _1872, March 23_.\r\n\r\n_À_ Messieurs\r\n  Messieurs ELIE DE BEAUMONT,\r\n  _et_ J.B. DUMAS,\r\n  _Secrétaires perpetuels de l'Académie\r\n  des Sciences, Institut de France._\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nI am honoured with your letter of March 18, communicating to me my\r\nnomination by the Academy of Sciences to the place rendered vacant in\r\nthe class of Foreign Associates of the Academy by the decease of Sir\r\nJohn Herschel, and enclosing Copy of the Decree of the President of\r\nthe French Republic approving the Election.\r\n\r\nIt is almost unnecessary for me to attempt to express to you the pride\r\nand gratification with which I receive this announcement. By universal\r\nconsent, the title of _Associé Etranger de l'Académie des Sciences_ is\r\nrecognised as the highest distinction to which any man of science can\r\naspire; and I can scarcely imagine that, unless by the flattering\r\ninterpretation of my friends in the Academy, I am entitled to bear\r\nit. But in any case, I am delighted to feel that the bands of\r\nfriendship are drawn closer between myself and the distinguished body\r\nwhom, partly by personal intercourse, partly by correspondence, and in\r\nevery instance by reputation, I have known so long.\r\n\r\nI beg that you will convey to the Academy my long-felt esteem for that\r\nbody in its scientific capacity, and my deep recognition of its\r\nfriendship to me and of the honor which it has conferred on me in the\r\nlate election.\r\n\r\n        I have the honor to be\r\n            Gentlemen,\r\n          Your very faithful servant,\r\n              G.B.

It is\r\nunfortunate that the Transit of 1874 will not be visible at Rio de\r\nJaneiro. For that of 1882, Rio will be a favourable position, and we\r\nreckon on the observations to be made there. Your Majesty may be\r\nassured that I shall loyally bear in mind your desire to be informed\r\nof any remarkable enterprise of this Observatory, or of any principal\r\nstep in the preparations for the Transit of Venus and of its results.\r\n\r\n        I have the honor to be\r\n              Sire,\r\n          Your Imperial Majesty's very faithful servant,\r\n                  G.B.

The\r\nfollowing letter from him (probably the last of their long\r\ncorrespondence) was written in this year, and appears characteristic:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE,\r\n                                                     _May 10, 1872_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AIRY,\r\n\r\nI have received your card of invitation for the 1st of June, and with\r\ngreat joy should I count upon that day if I thought that I should be\r\nable to accept your invitation: but alas I have no hope of the kind,\r\nfor that humiliating malady which now has fastened upon me for a full\r\nyear and a half has not let go its hold, nor is it likely to do so. A\r\nman who is journeying in the 88th year of his pilgrimage is not likely\r\nto throw off such a chronic malady. Indeed were I well enough to come\r\nI am deaf as a post and half blind, and if I were with you I should\r\nonly be able to play dummy. Several years have passed away since I was\r\nlast at your Visitation and I had great joy in seeing Mrs Airy and\r\nsome lady friends at the Observatory, but I could not then attend the\r\ndinner. At that Meeting were many faces that I knew, but strangely\r\naltered by the rude handling of old Time, and there were many new\r\nfaces which I had never seen before at a Royal Society Meeting; but\r\nworse than all, all the old faces were away. In vain I looked round\r\nfor Wollaston, Davy, Davies Gilbert, Barrow, Troughton, &c. &c.; and\r\nthe merry companion Admiral Smyth was also away, so that my last visit\r\nhad its sorrowful side. But why should I bother you with these old\r\nman's mopings.\r\n\r\nI send an old man's blessing and an old man's love to all the members\r\nof your family; especially to Mrs Airy, the oldest and dearest of my\r\nlady friends.\r\n\r\n        I remain, my dear Airy,\r\n          Your true-hearted old friend,\r\n                  his\r\n            ADAM   X   SEDGWICK.\r\n                  mark\r\n\r\nP.S. Shall I ever again gaze with wonder and delight from the great\r\nwindow of your Observatory.\r\n\r\nThe body of the above letter is in the handwriting of an amanuensis,\r\nbut the signature and Postscript are in Sedgwick's handwriting. (Ed.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1873\r\n\r\n\"Chronographic registration having been established at the Paris\r\nObservatory, Mr Hilgard, principal officer of the American Coast\r\nSurvey, has made use of it for determining the longitude of Harvard\r\nfrom Greenwich, through Paris, Brest, and St Pierre. For this purpose\r\nMr Hilgard's Transit Instrument was planted in the Magnetic Court. I\r\nunderstand that the result does not sensibly differ from that obtained\r\nby Mr Gould, through Valentia and Newfoundland.--It was known to the\r\nscientific world that several of the original thermometers,\r\nconstructed by Mr Sheepshanks (in the course of his preparation of the\r\nNational Standard of Length) by independent calibration of the bores,\r\nand independent determination of the freezing and boiling points on\r\narbitrary graduations, were still preserved at the Royal Observatory.\r\nIt was lately stated to me by M. Tresca, the principal officer of the\r\nInternational Metrical Commission, that, in the late unhappy war in\r\nParis, the French original thermometers were destroyed; and M. Tresca\r\nrequested that, if possible, some of the original thermometers made by\r\nMr Sheepshanks might be appropriated to the use of the International\r\nCommission. I have therefore transferred to M. Tresca the three\r\nthermometers A.6, S.1, S.2, with the documentary information relating\r\nto them, which was found in Mr Sheepshanks's papers; retaining six\r\nthermometers of the same class in the Royal Observatory.--The Sidereal\r\nStandard Clock continues to give great satisfaction. I am considering\r\n(with the aid of Mr Buckney, of the firm of E. Dent and Co.) an\r\narrangement for barometric correction, founded on the principle of\r\naction on the pendulum by means of a magnet which can be raised or\r\nlowered by the agency of a large barometer.--The Altazimuth has\r\nreceived some important alterations. An examination of the results of\r\nobservations had made me dissatisfied with the bearings of the\r\nhorizontal pivots in their Y's. Mr Simms, at my request, changed the\r\nbearings in Y's for bearing in segments of circles, a construction\r\nwhich has worked admirably well in the pivots of the Transit Circle.\"\r\n(And in various other respects the instrument appears to have received\r\na thorough overhauling. Ed.)--\"With the consent of the Royal Society\r\nand of the Kew Committee, the Kew Heliograph has been planted in the\r\nnew dome looking over the South Ground. It is not yet finally\r\nadjusted.--Some magnetic observations in the Britannia and Conway\r\ntubular bridges were made last autumn. For this purpose I detached an\r\nAssistant (Mr Carpenter), who was aided by Capt. Tupman, R.M.A.; in\r\nother respects the enterprise was private and at private expense.--The\r\nrates of the first six chronometers (in the annual trials) are\r\npublished, in a form which appears most likely to lead to examination\r\nof the causes that influence their merits or demerits. This report is\r\nextensively distributed to British and Foreign horologists and\r\ninstrument-makers. All these artists appear to entertain the\r\nconviction that the careful comparisons made at this Observatory, and\r\nthe orderly form of their publication, have contributed powerfully to\r\nthe improvement of chronometers.--Very lately, application has been\r\nmade to me, through the Board of Trade, for plans and other\r\ninformation regarding time-signal-balls, to assist in guiding the\r\nauthorities of the German Empire in the establishment of time signals\r\nat various ports of that State. In other foreign countries the system\r\nis extending, and is referred to Greenwich as its origin.--The\r\narrangements and preparations for the observation of the Transit of\r\nVenus occupied much attention. With regard to the photoheliographs it\r\nis proposed to make trial of a plan proposed by M. Janssen, for\r\nnumerous photographs of Venus when very near to the Sun's limb. On\r\nApr. 26th the engaging of photographic teachers was sanctioned.\r\nObservers were selected and engaged. A working model of the\r\nTransit was prepared, and the use of De La Rue's Scale was\r\npractised. There was some hostile criticism of the stations selected\r\nfor the observation of the Transit, which necessitated a formal\r\nreply.--Reference is made to the increase of facilities for making\r\nmagnetical and meteorological observations. The inevitable result of\r\nit is, that observations are produced in numbers so great that\r\ncomplete reduction becomes almost impossible. The labour of reduction\r\nis very great, and it is concluded that, of the enormous number of\r\nmeteorological observations now made at numerous observatories, very\r\nfew can ever possess the smallest utility.--Referring to my Numerical\r\nLunar Theory: on June 30th, 1873, a theory was formed, nearly but not\r\nperfectly complete. Numerical development of powers of a÷r and\r\nr÷a. Factors of corrections to Delaunay first attempted, but entirely\r\nin numerical form.\"--In March of this year Airy was consulted by Mr\r\nW.H. Barlow, C.E., and Mr Thomas Bouch (the Engineer of the Tay\r\nBridge, which was blown down in 1879, and of a proposed scheme for a\r\nForth Bridge in 1873) on the subject of the wind pressure, &c., that\r\nshould be allowed for in the construction of the bridge. Airy's report\r\non this question is dated 1873, Apr. 9th: it was subsequently much\r\nreferred to at the Official Enquiry into the causes of the failure of\r\nthe Tay Bridge.--At the end of this year Airy resigned the Presidency\r\nof the Royal Society. In his Address to the Society on Dec. 1st he\r\nstated his reasons in full, as follows: \"the severity of official\r\nduties, which seem to increase, while vigour to discharge them does\r\nnot increase; and the distance of my residence.... Another cause is a\r\ndifficulty of hearing, which unfits me for effective action as\r\nChairman of Council.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: There was the usual visit to Playford in January:\r\nalso a short visit in May: and a third visit at Christmas.--There was\r\na short run in June, of about a week, to Coniston, with one of his\r\ndaughters.--And there was a trip to Weymouth, &c., for about 10 days,\r\nwith one of his daughters, in the beginning of August--On his return\r\nfrom the last-mentioned trip, Airy found a letter from the Secretary\r\nof the Swedish Legation, enclosing the Warrant under the Royal Sign\r\nManual of His Majesty (Oscar), the King of Sweden and Norway, by which\r\nhe was nominated as a First Class Commander of the Order of the North\r\nStar, and accompanying the Decorations of that Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1874\r\n\r\n\"In this year Mr Glaisher resigned his appointment: I placed his\r\nDepartment (Magnetical and Meteorological) under Mr Ellis.--A balance\r\nof peculiar construction has been made by Mr Oertling, from my\r\ninstructions, and fixed near the public barometer at the Entrance\r\nGate. This instrument enables the public to test any ordinary pound\r\nweight, shewing on a scale the number of grains by which it is too\r\nheavy or too light.--Fresh counterpoises have been attached to the\r\nGreat Equatoreal to balance the additional weight of the new\r\nSpectroscope, which was finally received from Mr Browning's hands on\r\nMay 2nd of the present year. The Spectroscope is specifically adapted\r\nto sweeping round the Sun's limb, with a view to mapping out the\r\nprominences, and is also available for work on Stars and Nebulae, the\r\ndispersive power being very readily varied. An induction-coil, capable\r\nof giving a six-inch spark, has been made for this instrument by Mr\r\nBrowning.--Some new classes of reductions of the meteorological\r\nobservations from 1848 to 1868 have been undertaken and completed in\r\nthe past year. The general state of this work is as follows: The\r\ndiurnal changes of the dry-bulb thermometer, as depending on the\r\nmonth, on the temperature waves, on the barometric waves, on the\r\novercast and cloudless states of the sky, and on the direction of the\r\nwind, have been computed and examined for the whole period; and the\r\nexhibition of the results is ready for press. The similar reductions\r\nfor the wet-bulb thermometer are rapidly approaching completion.\r\n--Regarding the preparations for the Transit of Venus Expeditions.\r\nOriginally five stations were selected and fully equipped\r\nwith equatoreals, transits, altazimuths, photoheliographs, and clocks;\r\nbut I have since thought it desirable to supplement these by two\r\nbranch stations in the Sandwich Islands and one in Kerguelen's Island;\r\nand the additional instruments thus required have been borrowed from\r\nvarious sources, so that there is now an abundant supply of\r\ninstrumental means.... There will thus be available for observation of\r\nthe Transit of Venus 23 telescopes, nine of which will be provided\r\nwith double-image-micrometers; and five photoheliographs; and for\r\ndetermination of local time, and latitude and longitude, there will be\r\nnine transits and six altazimuths.... All the observers have undergone\r\na course of training in photography; first, under a professional\r\nphotographer, Mr Reynolds, and subsequently under Capt. Abney, R.E.,\r\nwhose new dry-plate process is to be adopted at all the British\r\nStations.... A Janssen slide, capable of taking 50 photographs of\r\nVenus and the neighbouring part of the Sun's limb at intervals of one\r\nsecond, has been made by Mr Dallmeyer for each of the five\r\nphotoheliographs.\"--Attached to the Report to the Visitors is a copy\r\nof the Instructions to Observers engaged in the Transit of Venus\r\nExpeditions, prepared with great care and in remarkable detail.--\"In\r\nthe past spring I published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society a statement of the fundamental points in a new\r\ntreatment of the Lunar Theory, by which, availing myself of all that\r\nhas been done in the best algebraical investigations of that theory, I\r\ntrust to be able by numerical operations only to give greater accuracy\r\nto final results. Considerable progress has been made in the extensive\r\nnumerical developments, the work being done, at my private expense,\r\nentirely by a junior computer; and I hope, at any rate, to put it in\r\nsuch a state that there will be no liability to its entire loss. When\r\nthis was reported to the Board of Visitors, it was resolved on the\r\nmotion of Prof. Stokes, that this work, as a public expense, ought to\r\nbe borne by the Government; and this was forwarded to the\r\nAdmiralty. On June 24th I wrote to the Secretary of the Admiralty,\r\nasking for _£100_ for the present year, which after the usual\r\nenquiries and explanations was sanctioned on Aug. 29th.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: There were short visits to Playford in January,\r\nJune, and October, but only for a few days in each case.--In March\r\nthere was a run of two or three days to Newnham (on the Severn) to see\r\nthe Bore on the Severn, and to Malvern.--In July he went to Newcastle\r\nto observe with Mr Newall's great telescope, but the weather was\r\nunfavourable: he then went on to Barrow House near Keswick, and spent\r\na few days there, with excursions among the mountains.--On Aug. 13th\r\nhe went with his daughter Christabel to the Isle of Arran, and then by\r\nGlasgow to the Trosachs, where he made several excursions to verify\r\nthe localities mentioned in the \"Lady of the Lake.\"--While in Scotland\r\nhe heard of the death of his brother, the Rev. William Airy, and\r\ntravelled to Keysoe in Bedfordshire to attend the funeral; and\r\nreturned to Greenwich on Aug. 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1875\r\n\r\n\"In October of this year I wrote to the Admiralty that I had grounds\r\nfor asking for an increase of my salary: because the pension which had\r\nbeen settled on my wife, and which I had practically recognized as\r\npart of my salary, had been terminated by her death; so that my salary\r\nnow stood lower by _£200_ than that of the Director of Studies of the\r\nRoyal Naval College. The Admiralty reply favourably, and on Nov. 27th\r\nthe Treasury raise my salary to _£1_,200.--For the service of the\r\nClock Movement of the Great Equatoreal, a water-cistern has been\r\nestablished in the highest part of the Ball-Turret, the necessity for\r\nwhich arose from the following circumstance: The Water Clock was\r\nsupplied by a small pipe, about 80 feet in length, connected with the\r\n3-inch Observatory main (which passes through the Park), at a distance\r\nof about 250 feet from any other branch pipe. In spite of this\r\ndistance I have seen that, on stopping the water-tap in the\r\nBattery-Basement under the North-East Turret, the pressure in the\r\ngauge of the Water Clock has been instantly increased by more than 40\r\nlbs. per square inch. The consequent derangement of the Water Clock in\r\nits now incessant daily use became intolerable. Since the independent\r\nsupply was provided, its performance has been most satisfactory.--With\r\nthe Spectroscope the solar prominences have been mapped on 28 days\r\nonly; but the weather of the past winter was exceptionally\r\nunfavourable for this class of observation. After mapping the\r\nprominences, as seen on the C line, the other lines, especially F and\r\nb, have been regularly examined, whenever practicable. Great care has\r\nbeen taken in determining the position, angle, and heights of the\r\nprominences in all cases. The spectrum of Coggia's Comet was examined\r\nat every available opportunity last July, and compared directly with\r\nthat of carbon dioxide, the bands of the two spectra being sensibly\r\ncoincident. Fifty-four measures of the displacement of lines in the\r\nspectra of 10 stars, as compared with the corresponding lines in the\r\nspectra of terrestrial elements (chiefly hydrogen), have been made,\r\nbut some of these appear to be affected by a constant error depending\r\non faulty adjustment of the Spectroscope.--Photographs of the Sun have\r\nbeen taken with the Kew Photoheliograph on 186 days; and of these 377\r\nhave been selected for preservation. The Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and\r\nseveral stars (including the Pleiades and some double stars) have been\r\nphotographed with the Great Equatoreal, with fairly satisfactory\r\nresults, though further practice is required in this class of work.--I\r\nwould mention a supplemental mechanism which I have myself introduced\r\ninto some chronometers. I have long remarked that, in ordinary good\r\nchronometers, the freedom from irregularities depending on mechanical\r\ncauses is most remarkable; but that, after all the efforts of the most\r\njudicious makers, there is in nearly every case a perceptible defect\r\nof thermal compensation. There is great difficulty in correcting the\r\nresidual fault, not only because an inconceivably small movement of\r\nthe weights on the balance-curve is required, but also because it\r\nendangers the equilibrium of the balance. The mechanism adopted to\r\nremedy the defect is described in a Paper in the Horological Journal\r\nof July 1875 by Mr W. Ellis, and has received the approval of some\r\nable chronometer-makers.--With respect to the Transit of Venus\r\nExpeditions: The parties from Egypt and Rodriguez are returned. I am\r\nin continual expectation of the arrival of the other parties. I\r\nbelieve the eye-observations and the ordinary photographs to be quite\r\nsuccessful; I doubt the advantage of the Janssen; one of the\r\ndouble-image-micrometers seems to have failed; and the\r\nZenith-telescope gives some trouble. At three stations at Rodriguez,\r\nand three at Kerguelen, the observations appear to have been most\r\nsuccessful. At the Sandwich Islands, two of the stations appear to\r\nhave been perfectly successful (except that I fear that the Janssen\r\nhas failed), and a rich series of lunar observations for longitude is\r\nobtained. At New Zealand, I grieve to say, the observations were\r\ntotally lost, entirely in consequence of bad weather. There has been\r\nlittle annoyance from the dreaded 'black drop.' Greater inconvenience\r\nand doubt have been caused by the unexpected luminous ring round\r\nVenus.--With regard to the progress of my proposed New Lunar Theory:\r\nThree computers are now steadily employed on the work. It will be\r\nremembered that the detail and mass of this work are purely numerical;\r\nevery numerical coefficient being accompanied with a symbolical\r\ncorrection whose value will sometimes depend on the time, but in every\r\ncase is ultimately to be obtained in a numerical form. Of these\r\ncoefficients, extracted (for convenience) from Delaunay's results,\r\nthere are 100 for parallax, 182 for longitude, 142 for latitude; the\r\narguments being preserved in the usual form.\"--After reviewing the\r\nchanges that had taken place at the Observatory during the past forty\r\nyears, the Report to the Board of Visitors concludes thus: \"I much\r\ndesire to see the system of time-signals extended, by clocks or daily\r\nsignals, to various parts of our great cities and our dockyards, and\r\nabove all by hourly signals on the Start Point, which I believe would\r\nbe the greatest of all benefits to nautical chronometry. Should any\r\nextension of our scientific work ever be contemplated, I would remark\r\nthat the Observatory is not the place for new physical investigations.\r\nIt is well adapted for following out any which, originating\r\nwith private investigators, have been reduced to laws susceptible\r\nof verification by daily observation. The National Observatory\r\nwill, I trust, always remain on the site where it was first\r\nplanted, and which early acquired the name of 'Flamsteed Hill.'\r\nThere are some inconveniences in the position, arising principally\r\nfrom the limited extent of the hill, but they are, in my opinion, very\r\nfar overbalanced by its advantages.\"--In a letter on the subject of\r\nthe Smith's Prizes Examination at Cambridge, which was always a matter\r\nof the greatest interest to him, Airy renewed his objections to the\r\npreponderance in the Papers of a class of Pure Mathematics, which he\r\nconsidered was never likely under any circumstances to give the\r\nslightest assistance to Physics. And, as before, these remarks called\r\nforth a rejoinder from Prof. Cayley, who was responsible for many of\r\nthe questions of the class referred to.--In this year Airy completed\r\nhis \"Notes on the Earlier Hebrew Scriptures,\" which were shortly\r\nafterwards published as a book by Messrs Longmans, Green, & Co. In his\r\nletter to the publishers introducing the subject, he says, \"For many\r\nyears past I have at times put together a few sentences explanatory as\r\nI conceive of the geographical and historical circumstances connected\r\nwith the principal events recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures. The view\r\nwhich I take is free, but I trust not irreverent. They terminate with\r\na brief review of Colenso's great work. The collection now amounts to\r\na small book.\" From the references already given in previous years to\r\nhis Papers and correspondence on the geography of Exodus, his\r\ncorrespondence with Colenso, &c. &c., it will be seen that he took a\r\ngreat interest in the early history of the Israelites.--On August\r\n10th, 1875, Airy celebrated the Bicentenary of the Royal Observatory\r\nby a dinner in the Octagon Room, which was attended by the Presidents\r\nof the Royal Society and the R. Astr. Society, and by a large number\r\nof Scientific gentlemen interested in Astronomy.--In February he was\r\nrevising his Treatise on \"Probabilities.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: up to Jan. 16th Airy was at Playford as\r\nusual.--For about a week in April he was in the Isle of Man with his\r\ndaughter Christabel.--In June there was a short trip to Salisbury,\r\nBlandford, and Wimborne.--On August 12th he started with his daughter\r\nAnnot for a holiday in Cumberland, but on the next day he was recalled\r\nby a telegram with the intelligence that a change for the worse had\r\ncome over his wife's health. Lady Airy died on August 13th, 1875. For\r\nthe last five years of her life she had been very helpless from the\r\neffects of a paralytic stroke--a very sad ending to a bright and happy\r\nlife--and had been continually nursed throughout this time by her two\r\nunmarried daughters with the greatest self-denial and devotion. Her\r\nhusband had been unremitting in his care and attention. Nothing was\r\nwanting that the most thoughtful kindness could supply. And in all his\r\ntrips and excursions his constant and kind letters shewed how anxious\r\nhe was that she should participate in all his interests and\r\namusements. From the nature of the case it could hardly be said that\r\nher death was unexpected, and he received the shock with the manly\r\nsteadiness which belonged to him. Lady Airy was buried in Playford\r\nchurchyard.--From Sept. 22nd to Oct. 4 he made a short expedition to\r\nWales (Capel Curig, &c.).--On Dec. 15th he attended the Commemoration\r\nat Trinity College, Cambridge.--On Dec. 22nd he went as usual to\r\nPlayford.\r\n\r\nIn this year Airy received the high honour of the Freedom of the City\r\nof London, in the following communication:\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONE, Mayor.--A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall\r\nof the City of London, on Thursday the 29th day of April 1875.\r\n\r\nResolved Unanimously\r\n\r\nThat the Freedom of this City in a Gold Box of the value of One\r\nhundred guineas be presented to Sir George Biddell Airy, K.C.B.,\r\nD.C.L., LL.D. &c., Astronomer Royal, as a recognition of his\r\nindefatigable labours in Astronomy, and of his eminent services in the\r\nadvancement of practical science, whereby he has so materially\r\nbenefited the cause of Commerce and Civilization.\r\n\r\n        MONCKTON.\r\n\r\nThis Resolution was forwarded with a letter from Benjamin Scott, the\r\nChamberlain. Airy's reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH, S.E.\r\n                                                      _1875, May 1_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have the honour to acknowledge your letter of April 30, accompanied\r\nwith Copy of the Resolution of the Common Council of the City of\r\nLondon passed at their Meeting of April 29, under signature of the\r\nTown Clerk, That the Freedom of the City of London in a valuable Box\r\nbe presented to me, in recognition of works stated in the\r\nResolution. And I am requested by you to inform you whether it is my\r\nintention to accept the compliment proposed by the Corporation.\r\n\r\nIn reply, I beg you to convey to the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor\r\nand the Corporation that I accept with the greatest pride and pleasure\r\nthe honour which they propose to offer to me. The Freedom of our Great\r\nCity, conferred by the spontaneous act of its Municipal Governors, is\r\nin my estimation the highest honour which it is possible to receive;\r\nand its presentation at this time is peculiarly grateful to me.\r\n\r\n        I have the honour to be,\r\n          Sir,\r\n            Your very obedient servant,\r\n              G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_Benjamin Scott, Esq.,\r\n  &c. &c. &c.\r\nChamberlain of the Corporation of the\r\n  City of London._\r\n\r\nAs it was technically necessary that a Freeman of the City of London\r\nshould belong to one or other of the City Companies, the Worshipful\r\nCompany of Spectacle Makers through their clerk (with very great\r\nappropriateness) enquired whether it would be agreeable that that\r\nCompany should have the privilege of conferring their Honorary Freedom\r\non him, and added: \"In soliciting your acquiescence to the proposal I\r\nam directed to call attention to the fact that this Guild is permitted\r\nto claim all manufacturers of Mathematical and Astronomical\r\nInstruments within the City of London, which is now pleaded as an\r\napology for the wish that one so distinguished as yourself in the use\r\nof such Instruments should be enrolled as a Member of this Craft.\"  In\r\nhis reply, accepting the Freedom of the Company, Airy wrote thus: \"I\r\nshall much value the association with a body whose ostensible title\r\nbears so close a relation to the official engagements which have long\r\noccupied me. I have had extensive experience both in arranging and in\r\nusing optical and mathematical instruments, and feel that my own\r\npursuits are closely connected with the original employments of the\r\nCompany.\" The Freedom of the Company was duly presented, and the\r\noccasion was celebrated by a banquet at the Albion Tavern on Tuesday,\r\nJuly 6th.\r\n\r\nThe Freedom of the City of London was conferred at a Court of Common\r\nCouncil held at the Guildhall on Thursday the 4th of November. In\r\npresenting the gold box containing the Freedom, the Chamberlain, in an\r\neloquent speech, first referred to the fact that this was the first\r\noccasion on which the Freedom had been conferred on a person whose\r\nname was associated with the sciences other than those of war and\r\nstatecraft. He then referred to the solid character of his work, in\r\nthat, while others had turned their attention to the more attractive\r\nfields of exploration, the discovery of new worlds or of novel\r\ncelestial phenomena, he had incessantly devoted himself to the less\r\ninteresting, less obtrusive, but more valuable walks of practical\r\nastronomy. And he instanced as the special grounds of the honour\r\nconferred, the compilation of nautical tables of extraordinary\r\naccuracy, the improvement of chronometers, the correction of the\r\ncompasses of iron ships, the restoration of the standards of length\r\nand weight, and the Transit of Venus Expeditions. In his reply Airy\r\nstated that he regarded the honour just conferred upon him as the\r\ngreatest and proudest ever received by him. He referred to the fact\r\nthat the same honour had been previously conferred on the valued\r\nfriend of his youth, Thomas Clarkson, and said that the circumstance\r\nof his succeeding such a man was to himself a great honour and\r\npleasure. He alluded to his having received a small exhibition from\r\none of the London Companies, when he was a poor undergraduate at\r\nCambridge, and acknowledged the great assistance that it had been to\r\nhim. With regard to his occupation, he said that he had followed it in\r\na great measure because of its practical use, and thought it fortunate\r\nthat from the first he was connected with an institution in which\r\nutility was combined with science. The occasion of this presentation\r\nwas celebrated by a Banquet at the Mansion House on Saturday July 3rd,\r\n1875, to Sir George Airy (Astronomer Royal) and the Representatives of\r\nLearned Societies.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Airy was extremely gratified by the honour that\r\nhe had received. It was to him the crowning honour of his life, and\r\ncoming last of all it threw all his other honours into the shade. To\r\nhis independent and liberal spirit there was something peculiarly\r\ntouching in the unsolicited approbation and act of so powerful and\r\ndisinterested a body as the Corporation of the City of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n           AT GREENWICH OBSERVATORY FROM JANUARY 1ST, 1876,\r\n             TO HIS RESIGNATION OF OFFICE ON AUGUST 15TH,\r\n                                1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1876\r\n\r\n\"At the door from the Front Court to the staircase of the Octagon Room\r\n(the original entrance to the Observatory as erected by Sir\r\nChristopher Wren), a small porch-shelter has been often desired. I\r\nproposed to fix there a fan-roof of quadrantal form, covering the\r\nupper flat stone of the external steps.--On a critical examination of\r\nthe micrometer-screws of the Transit Circle it was found that the\r\ncorrections, which range from -1°38\" to +0°76\", indicate considerable\r\nwear in the screws; and it was found that as much as one-hundreth part\r\nof an inch had been worn away from some of the threads. The old screws\r\nwere consequently discarded, and new ones were made by Mr Simms.--The\r\nadjustment of the Spectroscope has occupied a great deal of\r\nattention. There was astigmatism of the prisms; and false light\r\nreflected from the base of the prisms, causing loss both of light and\r\nof definition. The latter defect was corrected by altering the angles,\r\nand then astigmatism was corrected by a cylindrical lens near the\r\nslit. The definition in both planes was then found to be perfect.--The\r\nnumber of small planets has now become so great, and the interest of\r\nestablishing the elements of all their orbits so small,--while at the\r\nsame time the light of all those lately discovered is very faint, and\r\nthe difficulty and doubt of observation greatly increased,--that I\r\nhave begun to think seriously of limiting future observations to a\r\nsmall number of these objects.--All observations with the Spectroscope\r\nhave been completely reduced; the measures of lines in the spectra of\r\nelements being converted into corresponding wave-lengths, and the\r\nobservations of displacement of lines in the spectra of stars being\r\nreduced so as to exhibit the concluded motion in miles per second,\r\nafter applying a correction for the earth's motion. Sixteen measures\r\nof the F line in the spectrum of the Moon as compared with hydrogen\r\ngive a displacement corresponding to a motion of less than two miles a\r\nsecond, which seems to shew that the method of comparison now adopted\r\nis free from systematic error; and this is supported by the manner in\r\nwhich motions of approach and recession are distributed among the\r\nstars examined on each night of observation. The results recently\r\nobtained appear to be on the whole as consistent as can be expected in\r\nsuch delicate observations, and they support in a remarkable manner\r\nthe conclusions of Dr Huggins, with regard to the motions of those\r\nstars which he examined.--Photographs of the sun have been taken with\r\nthe photoheliograph on 182 days. On one of the photographs, which was\r\naccidentally exposed while the drop slit was being drawn up, there\r\nappears to be a faint image of a cloud-like prominence close to the\r\nsun's limb, though the exposure probably only amounted to a fraction\r\nof a second. A prominence of unusual brilliancy was seen with the\r\nSpectroscope about the same time and in the same position with\r\nreference to the Sun's limb. All groups of Sun-spots and faculae have\r\nbeen numbered, and the dates of their first and last appearances\r\nentered up to the present time. Areas of spots have been measured, and\r\nthe measures have been reduced to millionths of the Sun's visible\r\nhemisphere.--The examination of the readings of the deep-sunk\r\nthermometers from 1846 to 1873 has exhibited some laws which had been\r\nsufficiently established before this time, and some which were less\r\nknown. Among the former were the successive retardations of seasons\r\nin successive descents, amounting to about four months at the depth of\r\n25 feet; and the successive diminutions of the annual range of\r\ntemperature. Among the latter is the character of the changes from\r\nyear to year, which the great length of this series of observations\r\nbrings well to light. It is found that from year to year the mean\r\ntemperature of the surface for the year, varying by three or four\r\ndegrees of Fahrenheit, follows in its changes the mean temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere for the year, and that the changes of annual\r\ntemperature are propagated downwards, retarded in phase and\r\ndiminishing in amount of change, in the same manner (though probably\r\nnot following the same law) as the season changes. The inference from\r\nthis is, that changes of temperature come entirely from the exterior\r\nand in no discoverable degree from the interior; an inference which\r\nmay be important in regard both to solar action and to geology.\r\n--Referring to the Transit of Venus observations: In the\r\nastronomical part of the reductions, there has been great labour and\r\ndifficulty in the determination of local sidereal times; some books of\r\nobservations required extensive transcription; some instrumental\r\nerrors are still uncertain; the latter determinations have perplexed\r\nus so much that we are inclined to believe that, in spite of the great\r\nfacilities of reduction given by the transit instrument, it would be\r\nbetter to rely on the altazimuth for time-determinations.... In the\r\nphotographic part, I have confined my attention entirely to measures\r\nof the distance between the centres of the Sun and Planet, a\r\ntroublesome and complex operation.--Referring to the progress of the\r\nNumerical Lunar Theory: With a repetition of grant from the Treasury,\r\nI have usually maintained four junior computers on this work. The\r\nprogress, though considerable, has not been so great as I had hoped,\r\nby reason of the excessive personal pressure upon me during the whole\r\nyear.--I wrote a letter of congratulation to Le Verrier on the\r\ncompletion of his great work of Planetary Tables.--On May 13th the\r\nQueen was at South Kensington, and I attended to explain the\r\nastronomical instruments, and shewed Her Majesty one of the Transit of\r\nVenus photographs.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: He returned from his Playford visit on the 18th of\r\nJanuary.--In April there was a two-day trip to Colchester.--From June\r\n13th to July 12th he was travelling in the North of Scotland and the\r\nOrkneys with his daughters, staying for a short time with Mr Webster,\r\nM.P., at Aberdeen, and with Mr Newall at Newcastle.--In September\r\nthere was a week's run to Birkenhead and Keswick.--In November a\r\nweek's run to Playford.--From the 13th to 15th of December he was at\r\nCambridge, and on the 28th he went to Playford for the usual winter\r\nstay there.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1877\r\n\r\n\"In April of this year I was much engaged on the subject of Mr Gill's\r\nexpedition to Ascension to observe for the determination of the\r\nparallax of Mars at the approaching opposition of that planet.--A\r\nlarge Direct-vision Spectroscope has been quite recently made by Mr\r\nHilger under Mr Christie's direction on a new plan, in which either\r\ngreat dispersion or great purity of spectrum is obtained by the use of\r\n'Half-prisms,' according as the incident pencil falls first on the\r\nperpendicular or on the oblique face. In this Spectroscope either one\r\nor two half prisms can be used at pleasure, according to the\r\ndispersion required, and there is facility for increasing the train to\r\nthree or four half-prisms, though the dispersion with two only is\r\nnearly double of that given by the large ten-prism Spectroscope. The\r\ndefinition in this form of Spectroscope appears to be very fine.--At\r\nthe end of May 1876, spectroscopic determinations of the Sun's\r\nrotation were made by observations of the relative displacement of the\r\nFraunhofer lines at the east and west limbs respectively. The results\r\nare in close agreement with the value of the rotation found from\r\nobservations of Sun-spots. A similar determination has also been made\r\nin the case of Jupiter, with equally satisfactory results.--An\r\nElectrometer on Sir William Thomson's plan, for continuous\r\nphotographic registration of atmospheric electricity has been received\r\nfrom Mr White of Glasgow. It was mounted in December.--The computation\r\nof the photographic records of the barometer from 1854 to 1873 has so\r\nfar advanced that we can assert positively that there is no trace of\r\nlunar tide in the atmosphere; but that there is a strongly marked\r\nsemi-diurnal solar tide, accompanied with a smaller diurnal tide. We\r\nare at present engaged in comparing the barometric measures with the\r\ndirections of the wind.--Regarding the distribution of the printed\r\nobservations: There is no extensive wish for separate magnetic\r\nobservations, but general magnetic results are in great demand,\r\nespecially for mining operations, and to meet this a map of magnetic\r\ndeclination is furnished in the newspaper called the 'Colliery\r\nGuardian.'--As regards the operations for the Transit of Venus: The\r\ncomputing staff has by degrees been reduced to two junior computers\r\nwithin the Observatory; and one or two computers external to the\r\nObservatory, who are employed on large groups of systematic\r\ncalculations. The principal part of the calculations remaining at the\r\ndate of the last Report was that applying to the determination of the\r\ngeographical longitudes of fundamental stations. At the moment of my\r\nwriting, the last of these (the longitude of Observatory Bay,\r\nKerguelen) is not absolutely finished:... The method of determining\r\nthe geographical longitude of the principal station in each group by\r\nvertical transits of the Moon has been found very successful at\r\nHonolulu and Rodriguez. For stations in high south latitude,\r\nhorizontal transits are preferable.--As regards the Numerical Lunar\r\nTheory: With the view of preserving, against the ordinary chances of\r\ndestruction or abandonment, a work which is already one of\r\nconsiderable magnitude, I have prepared and have printed as Appendix\r\nto the Greenwich Observations (with additional copies as for a\r\nseparate work) the ordinary Equations of Lunar Disturbance, the novel\r\ntheory of Symbolical Variations, and the Numerical Developments of the\r\nquantities on the first side of the Equations.--At various times from\r\nFebruary to May I was engaged on the reduction of Malta Tides, and on\r\na Paper concerning the same.--In July I was awarded the Albert Medal\r\nfor my Compass corrections, and received the same from the Prince of\r\nWales.--In February, Campbell's instrument for the registration of\r\nsunshine was introduced: it was mounted in July.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: \"I was at Playford until Jan. 19th, in close\r\ncorrespondence as usual with Mr Christie at the Observatory, and\r\nattending to my Numerical Lunar Theory.--From Mar. 29th to Apr. 2nd I\r\nwent on a short trip to Hereford, Worcester, &c.--From June 8th to\r\n20th I was at Playford.--From Aug. 13th to Sept. 8th Airy was on an\r\nexpedition in Ireland, chiefly in the North and West, with his\r\ndaughters. When at Dublin he visited Grubb's instrument factory. On\r\nthe return journey he stayed for some time in the Lake District of\r\nCumberland, and took soundings in the neighbourhood of the place of\r\nthe 'floating island' in Derwentwater.\"\r\n\r\nAiry took the greatest interest in antiquarian matters, whether\r\nmilitary or ecclesiastical, and his feelings on such matters is well\r\nillustrated by the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                    ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH, S.E.\r\n                                                _1877, February 27_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI venture to ask if you can assist me in the following matter.\r\n\r\nIn the Parish Church of Playford, near Ipswich, Suffolk, was a\r\nsplendid brass tombstone to Sir Thomas Felbrigg. By an act of folly\r\nand barbarism, almost unequalled in the history of the world, the\r\nIncumbent and Curate nearly destroyed the brass inscription\r\nsurrounding the image of the Knight.\r\n\r\nThis tombstone is figured in Gough's Sepulchral Antiquities, which, I\r\npresume, is to be found in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nAnd I take the liberty to ask if you would kindly look at the\r\nengraving, and give me any suggestion as to the way in which some\r\ncopies of it could be made, in a fairly durable form. I am connected\r\nwith the parish of Playford, and am anxious to preserve for it this\r\nmemorial of a family of high rank formerly resident there.\r\n\r\n        I am, dear Sir,\r\n          Very faithfully yours,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_T. Winter Jones, Esq._\r\n\r\nTo this request Mr Winter Jones immediately acceded, and the engraving\r\nwas duly photographed, and copies were circulated with a historical\r\nnotice of Sir George (not Sir Thomas) Felbrigg and a history of the\r\nMonument. Sir George Felbrigg was Esquire-at-Arms to Edward III., and\r\nLord of the Manor of Playford: he died in 1400, and was buried in the\r\nNorth wall of Playford Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1878\r\n\r\nThe Report to the Board of Visitors has this paragraph: \"I continue to\r\nremark the approaching necessity for Library extension. Without having\r\nabsolutely decided on a site, I may suggest that I should wish to\r\nerect a brick building, about 50 feet by 20, consisting of two very\r\nlow stories (or rather of one story with a gallery running round its\r\nwalls), so low that books can be moved by hand without necessity for a\r\nladder.--In the month of December, 1877, the azimuthal error of the\r\nTransit Circle had increased to 10\". A skilful workman, instructed by\r\nMr Simms, easily reduced the error to about 2\".5 (which would leave\r\nits mean error nearly 0), the western Y being moved to the north so\r\nfar as to reduce the reading of the transit micrometer, when pointed\r\nto the south, from 35r.500 to 35r.000. The level error was not\r\nsensibly affected.--The Sidereal Standard Clock preserves a rate\r\napproaching to perfection, so long as it is left without disturbance\r\nof the galvanic-contact springs (touched by its pendulum), which\r\ntransmit signals at every second of time to sympathetic clocks and the\r\nchronograph. A readjustment of these springs usually disturbs the\r\nrate.--To facilitate the observations of stars, a new working\r\ncatalogue has been prepared, in which are included all stars down to\r\nthe third magnitude, stars down to the fifth magnitude which have not\r\nbeen observed in the last two catalogues, and a list of 258 stars of\r\nabout the sixth magnitude of which the places are required for the\r\nUnited States Coast Survey. The whole number of stars in our new\r\nworking list is about 2500. It may be here mentioned that an extensive\r\nseries of observations was made, during the autumn, of about 70 stars,\r\nat the request of Mr Gill, for comparison with Mars, Ariadne, and\r\nMelpomene.--On Apr. 10th last, a very heavy fall of rain took\r\nplace. Between Apr. 10d. 5h. and Apr. 11d. 2h., 2.824 inch. was\r\nrecorded, and 75 per cent. of this, or 2.12 inch., fell in the eight\r\nhours between 13-1/2h. and 21-1/2h.; and on May 7, 1 inch of rain fell\r\nin 50 minutes, of which 1/2 inch fell in 15 minutes.--The\r\nsupplementary compensation continues to be applied with success to\r\nGovernment chronometers which offer facilities for its introduction,\r\nand a marked improvement in the performance of chronometers returned\r\nafter repair by the makers appears to have resulted from the increased\r\nattention now given to the compensation. Of the 29 competitive\r\nchronometers, 25 have the supplementary compensation.\"--With regard to\r\nthe reduction of the observations of the Transit of Venus: After\r\nreference to the difficulties arising from the errors and the\r\ninterpretation of the language used by some of the observers, the\r\nReport continues thus: \"Finally a Report was made to the Government on\r\nJuly 5th, giving as the mean result for Mean Solar Parallax 8\".76; the\r\nresults from ingress and from egress, however, differing to the extent\r\nof 0\".11.... After further examination and consideration, the result\r\nfor parallax has been increased to 8\".82 or 8\".83. The results from\r\nphotography have disappointed me much. The failure has arisen, perhaps\r\nsometimes from irregularity of limb, or from atmospheric distortion,\r\nbut more frequently from faintness and from want of clear\r\ndefinition. Many photographs, which to the eye appeared good, lost all\r\nstrength and sharpness when placed under the measuring microscope. A\r\nfinal result 8\".17 was obtained from Mr Burton's measures, and 8\".08\r\nfrom Capt. Tupman's.--With regard to the Numerical Lunar Theory: A\r\ncursory collection of the terms relating to the Areas (in the\r\nEcliptic) led me to suppose that there might be some error in the\r\ncomputations of the Annual Equation and related terms. A most jealous\r\nre-examination has however detected nothing, and has confirmed my\r\nbelief in the general accuracy of the numerical computations. I dare\r\nnot yet venture to assume an error in Delaunay's theory; but I\r\nremember that the Annual Equation gave great trouble to the late Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock, and that he more than once changed his conclusions as to\r\nits true value.--In February I was engaged on the drawings and\r\npreparations for my intended Lecture at Cockermouth on the probable\r\ncondition of the interior of the Earth. The Lecture was delivered in\r\nApril.--At different times in the autumn I was engaged on diagrams to\r\nillustrate the passage of rays through eye-pieces and double-image\r\nmicrometers.--The miscellaneous scientific correspondence, which was\r\nalways going on, was in this year unusually varied and heavy.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: He was at Playford till Jan. 26th.--In April he\r\nwent to Cockermouth to deliver his Lecture above-mentioned: the\r\njourney was by Birmingham, where he stayed for two days (probably with\r\nhis son Osmund, who resided there), to Tarn Bank (the residence of\r\nIsaac Fletcher, M.P.): the lecture was delivered on the 22nd: he made\r\nexcursions to Thirlmere and Barrow, and to Edward I.'s Monument, and\r\nreturned to Greenwich on the 27th.--From June 17th to 28th he was at\r\nPlayford.--From Aug. 19th to Sept. 17th he was travelling in Scotland,\r\nvisiting the Tay Bridge, the Loch Katrine Waterworks, &c., and spent\r\nthe last fortnight of his trip at Portinscale, near Keswick. On\r\nDec. 23rd he went to Playford.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1879\r\n\r\n\"The manuscripts of every kind, which are accumulated in the ordinary\r\ntransactions of the Observatory, are preserved with the same care and\r\narranged on the same system as heretofore. The total number of bound\r\nvolumes exceeds 4000. Besides these there is the great mass of Transit\r\nof Venus reductions and manuscripts, which when bound may be expected\r\nto form about 200 volumes.--With regard to the numerous group of Minor\r\nPlanets, the Berlin authorities have most kindly given attention to my\r\nrepresentation, and we have now a most admirable and comprehensive\r\nEphemeris. But the extreme faintness of the majority of these bodies\r\nplaces them practically beyond the reach of our meridian instrument,\r\nand the difficulty of observation is in many cases further increased\r\nby the large errors of the predicted places.--After a fine autumn, the\r\nweather in the past winter and spring has been remarkably bad. More\r\nthan an entire lunation was lost with the Transit Circle, no\r\nobservation of the Moon on the meridian having been possible between\r\nJanuary 8 and March 1, a period of more than seven weeks. Neither Sun\r\nnor stars were visible for eleven days, during which period the\r\nclock-times were carried on entirely by the preceding rate of the\r\nclock. The accumulated error at the end of this time did not exceed\r\n0s'3.--Some difficulty was at first experienced with the Thomson\r\nElectrometer, which was traced to want of insulation. This has been\r\nmastered by the use of glass supporters, which carry some sulphuric\r\nacid. The instrument is now in excellent order, and the photographic\r\nregisters have been perfectly satisfactory since 1879, February, when\r\nthe new insulators were applied.--From the annual curves of diurnal\r\ninequality, deduced from the Magnetic Reductions, most important\r\ninferences may be drawn, as to the connection between magnetic\r\nphenomena and sun-spots. These annual curves shew a well-marked\r\nchange in close correspondence with the number of sun-spots. About the\r\nepoch of maximum of sun-spots they are large and nearly circular,\r\nhaving the same character as the curves for the summer months; whilst\r\nabout the time of sun-spot minimum they are small and\r\nlemniscate-shaped, with a striking resemblance to the curves for the\r\nwinter months. The connection between changes of terrestrial magnetism\r\nand sun-spots is shewn in a still more striking manner by a comparison\r\nwhich Mr Ellis has made between the monthly means of the diurnal range\r\nof declination and horizontal force, and Dr R. Wolf's 'relative\r\nnumbers' for frequency of sun-spots.--The records of sunshine with\r\nCampbell's Registering Sun-dial are preserved in a form easily\r\naccessible for reference, and the results are communicated weekly to\r\nthe Agricultural Gazette.--Prof. Oppolzer's results for the\r\ndetermination of the longitudes of Vienna and Berlin, made in 1877,\r\nhave now been made public. They shew a remarkable agreement of the\r\nChronometric determination formerly made with the Telegraphic. It may\r\nbe of interest to recall the fact that a similar agreement was found\r\nbetween the Chronometric and Telegraphic determinations of the\r\nlongitude of Valentia.--For observing the Transit of Venus of 1882,\r\nthe general impression appears to be that it will be best to confine\r\nour observations to simple telescopic observations or micrometer\r\nobservations at Ingress and Egress, if possible at places whose\r\nlongitudes are known. For the first phenomenon (accelerated ingress)\r\nthe choice of stations is not good; but for the other phenomena\r\n(retarded ingress, accelerated egress, retarded egress) there appears\r\nto be no difficulty.--With regard to the Numerical Lunar Theory:\r\nRespecting the discordance of Annual Equation, I suspend my\r\njudgment. I have now discussed the theory completely; and in going\r\ninto details of secular changes, I am at this time engaged on that\r\nwhich is the foundation of all, namely, the change of excentricity of\r\nthe Solar Orbit, and its result in producing Lunar Acceleration. An\r\nimportant error in the theoretical formulae for Variations of Radius\r\nVector, Longitude, and Latitude, was discovered; some calculations\r\ndepending on them are cancelled.\"--Referring to the magnitude of the\r\nprinted volume of \"Greenwich Observations,\" and the practicability of\r\nreducing the extent of it, the Report states thus: \"The tendency of\r\nexternal scientific movement is to give great attention to the\r\nphenomena of the Solar disc (in which this Observatory ought\r\nundoubtedly to bear its part). And I personally am most unwilling to\r\nrecede from the existing course of magnetical and meteorological\r\nobservations....The general tendency of these considerations is to\r\nincrease the annual expenses of the Observatory. And so it has been,\r\nalmost continuously, for the last 42 years. The annual ordinary\r\nexpenses are now between 2-1/2 and 3 times as great as in my first\r\nyears at the Royal Observatory.--Mr Gill was appointed to the Cape\r\nObservatory, and I wrote out instructions for him in March: there was\r\nsubsequently much correspondence respecting the equipment and repairs\r\nof the Cape Observatory.\"--In the Monthly Notices of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society for January an article had appeared headed \"Notes\r\non the late Admiral Smyth's Cycle of Celestial Objects, Vol. II.\" by\r\nMr Herbert Sadler. In this article Mr Sadler had criticized the work\r\nof Admiral Smyth in a manner which Airy regarded as imputing bad faith\r\nto Admiral Smyth. He at once took up the defence of his old friend\r\nvery warmly, and proposed certain Drafts of Resolutions to the Council\r\nof the Society. These Resolutions were moved, but were amended or\r\nnegatived, and Airy immediately resigned his office of\r\nVice-President. There was considerable negociation on the subject, and\r\ndiscussion with Lord Lindsay, and on May 9th Airy's Resolutions were\r\naccepted by the Council.--In October Airy inspected the \"Faraday\"\r\ntelegraph ship, then lying in the river near Messrs Siemens' works,\r\nand broke his finger by a fall on board the vessel.--In this year Airy\r\nwrote and circulated a letter to the Members of the Senate of the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, on the subject of the Papers set in the\r\nSmith's Prizes Examination. In this letter, as on former occasions, he\r\nobjected much to the large number of questions in \"purely idle\r\nalgebra, arbitrary combinations of symbols, applicable to no further\r\npurpose.\" And in particular he singled out for comment the following\r\nquestion, which was one of those set, \"Using the term circle as\r\nextending to the case where the radius is a pure imaginary, it is\r\nrequired to construct the common chord of two given circles.\" This\r\ndrew forth as usual a rejoinder from Prof. Cayley, who wrote\r\nenclosing a solution of his problem, but not at all to Airy's\r\nsatisfaction, who replied as follows: \"I am not so deeply plunged in\r\nthe mists of impossibles as to appreciate fully your explanation in\r\nthis instance, or to think that it is a good criterion for University\r\ncandidates.\"\r\n\r\nOf private history: On Jan. 21st he returned from Playford.--On March\r\n22nd he attended the funeral of his sister at Little Welnetham near\r\nBury St Edmunds: Miss Elizabeth Airy had lived with him at the\r\nObservatory from shortly after his appointment.--For about a week at\r\nthe end of April he was visiting Matlock, Edensor, and Buxton.--From\r\nJune 14th to July 18th he was staying at Portinscale near Keswick.--He\r\nwas at Playford for two or three days in October, and went there again\r\non Dec. 23rd for his usual winter holiday.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, relating to the life of Thomas Clarkson, was\r\nwritten to Dr Merivale, Dean of Ely, after reading the account in the\r\n\"Times\" of October 10th of the unveiling of a statue of Clarkson near\r\nWare:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                 LONDON, S.E.\r\n                                                 _1879, October 11_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nPardon my intrusion on you, in reference to a transaction which has\r\ngreatly interested me--the honour paid by you to the memory of Thomas\r\nClarkson. With very great pleasure I have heard of this step: and I\r\nhave also been much satisfied with the remarks on it in the \"Times.\" I\r\nwell remember, in Clarkson's \"History of the Abolition,\" which I read\r\nsome 60 years ago, the account of the circumstance, now commemorated\r\nby you, which determined the action of his whole subsequent life.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that, among those who still remember Clarkson, my\r\nacquaintance with him began at the earliest time of all. I knew him,\r\nintimately, from the beginning of 1815 to his death. The family which\r\nhe represented must have occupied a very good position in society. I\r\nhave heard that he sold two good estates to defray the expenses which\r\nhe incurred in his personal labours for Abolition: and his brother was\r\nGovernor of Sierra Leone (I know not at what time appointed). Thomas\r\nClarkson was at St John's College; and, as I gather from circumstances\r\nwhich I have heard him mention, must have been a rather gay man. He\r\nkept a horse, and at one time kept two. He took Orders in the Church;\r\nand on one occasion, in the course of his Abolition struggle, he\r\npreached in a church. But he afterwards resolutely laid aside all\r\npretensions to the title of Minister of the Church, and never would\r\naccept any title except as layman. He was, however, a very earnest\r\nreader of theology during my acquaintance with him, and appeared to be\r\nwell acquainted with the Early Fathers.\r\n\r\nThe precise words in which was announced the subject for Prize Essay\r\nin the University were \"Anne liceat invitos in servitutem trahere.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the first great victory on the slave trade question, he\r\nestablished himself in a house on the bank of Ullswater. I have not\r\nidentified the place: from a view which he once shewed me I supposed\r\nit to be near the bottom of the lake: but from an account of the storm\r\nof wind which he encountered when walking with a lady over a pass, it\r\nseemed to be in or near Patterdale. When the remains of a mountaineer,\r\nwho perished in Helvellyn (as described in Scott's well-known poem),\r\nwere discovered by a shepherd, it was to Mr Clarkson that the\r\nintelligence was first brought.\r\n\r\nHe then lived at Bury St Edmunds. Mrs Clarkson was a lady of Bury. But\r\nI cannot assign conjecturally any dates to his removals or his\r\nmarriage. His only son took his B.A. degree, I think, about 1817.\r\n\r\nI think it was in 1814 that he began his occupation of Playford\r\nHall--a moated mansion near Ipswich, formerly of great importance\r\n--where he lived as Gentleman Farmer, managing a farm leased\r\nfrom the Marquis of Bristol, and occupying a good position among the\r\ngentry of the county. A relative of mine, with whom I was most\r\nintimately acquainted, lived in the same parish (where in defiance of\r\nschool rules I spent nearly half my time, to my great advantage as I\r\nbelieve, and where I still retain a cottage for occasional residence),\r\nand I enjoyed much of Mr Clarkson's notice. It was by his strong\r\nadvice that I was sent to Cambridge, and that Trinity College was\r\nselected: he rode with me to Rev. Mr Rogers of Sproughton for\r\nintroductory examination; he introduced me to Rev. C. Musgrave\r\n(subsequently of Halifax), accidentally doing duty at Grundisburgh,\r\nwho then introduced me to Sedgwick, Peacock, and T. Musgrave\r\n(subsequently of York). In 1825, when I spent the summer at Keswick,\r\nhe introduced me to Southey and Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nMr Clarkson lived about thirty years at Playford Hall, and died there,\r\nand lies interred with his wife, son, and grandson, in Playford\r\nchurchyard. I joined several friends in erecting a granite obelisk to\r\nhis memory in the same churchyard. His family is extinct: but a\r\ndaughter of his brother is living, first married to T. Clarkson's son,\r\nand now Mrs Dickinson, of the Rectory, Wolferton.\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Very faithfully yours,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_The Very Reverend,\r\n  The Dean of Ely._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1880\r\n\r\n\"The Admiralty, on final consideration of the estimates, decided not\r\nto proceed with the erection of a new Library near the Magnetic\r\nObservatory in the present year. In the mean time the space has been\r\ncleared for the erection of a building 50 by 20 feet.--I have removed\r\nthe Electrometer Mast (a source of some expense and some danger), the\r\nperfect success of Sir William Thomson's Electrometer rendering all\r\nfurther apparatus for the same purpose unnecessary.--Many years ago a\r\ndouble-image micrometer, in which the images were formed by the double\r\nrefraction of a sphere of quartz, was prepared by Mr Dollond for\r\nCapt. Smyth, R.N. Adopting the same principle on a larger scale, I\r\nhave had constructed by Mr Hilger a micrometer with double refraction\r\nof a sphere of Iceland spar. Marks have been prepared for examination\r\nof the scale, but I have not yet had opportunity of trying it.--The\r\nspectroscopic determination of Star-motions has been steadily\r\npursued. The stars are taken from a working list of 150 stars, which\r\nmay eventually be extended to include all stars down to the fourth\r\nmagnitude, and it is expected that in the course of time the motions\r\nof about 300 stars may be spectroscopically determined.--A new\r\npressure-plate with springs has been applied by Mr Browning to Osler's\r\nAnemometer, and it is proposed to make such modification as will give\r\na scale extending to 50 lbs. pressure on the square foot. Other parts\r\nof the instrument have also been renewed.--As regards the reduction of\r\nthe magnetical results since 1863: In the study of the forms of the\r\nindividual curves; their relations to the hour, the month, the year;\r\ntheir connection with solar or meteorological facts; the conjectural\r\nphysico-mechanical causes by which they are produced; there is much to\r\noccupy the mind. I regret that, though in contemplation of these\r\ncurves I have remarked some singular (but imperfect) laws, I have not\r\nbeen able to pursue them.--The mean temperature of the year 1879 was\r\n46.1°, being 3.3° below the average of the preceding 38 years. The\r\nhighest temperature was 80.6° on July 30, and the lowest 13.7° on\r\nDec. 7. The mean temperature was below the average in every month of\r\nthe year; the months of greatest deviation being January and December,\r\nrespectively 6.8° and 7.6° below the average; the months of April,\r\nMay, July, and November were each between 4° and 5° below the average.\r\nThe number of hours of bright sunshine, recorded with Campbell's\r\nSunshine Instrument, during 1879, was only 983.--In the summer of 1879\r\nCommander Green, U.S.N., came over to this country for the purpose of\r\ndetermining telegraphically the longitude of Lisbon, as part of a\r\nchain of longitudes extending from South America to Greenwich. A\r\nsuccessful interchange of signals was made with Commander Green\r\nbetween Greenwich and Porthcurno on four nights, 1879, June 25 to\r\n29. The results communicated by Commander Green shew that the\r\nlongitude of Lisbon Observatory, as adopted in the Nautical Almanac,\r\nrequires the large correction of +8.54\".--With regard to the coming\r\nTransit of Venus in 1882: From the facility with which the\r\nrequirements for geographical position are satisfied, and from the\r\nrapid and accurate communication of time now given by electric\r\ntelegraph, the observation of this Transit will be comparatively easy\r\nand inexpensive. I have attached greater importance than I did\r\nformerly to the elevation of the Sun.... I remark that it is highly\r\ndesirable that steps be taken now for determining by telegraph the\r\nlongitude of some point of Australia. I have stated as the general\r\nopinion that it will be useless to repeat photographic observations.\r\n--In April Mr Barlow called, in reference to the Enquiry on\r\nthe Tay Bridge Disaster. (The Bridge had been blown down on\r\nDec. 28th, 1879.) I prepared a memorandum on the subject for the Tay\r\nBridge Commission, and gave evidence in a Committee Room of the House\r\nof Lords on Apr. 29th.\" (Much of the Astronomer Royal's evidence on\r\nthis occasion had reference to the opinions which he had expressed\r\nconcerning the wind-pressure which might be expected on the projected\r\nForth Bridge, in 1873.)--In May Airy was consulted by the\r\nPostmaster-General in the matter of a dispute which had arisen between\r\nthe Post Office and the Telephone Companies, which latter were alleged\r\nto have infringed the monopoly of the Post Office in commercial\r\ntelegraphs: Airy made a declaration on the subject.--In July Mr\r\nBakhuyzen came to England to determine the longitude of Leyden, on\r\nwhich he was engaged till Sept. 9th, and carried on his observations\r\nat the Observatory.--In July Airy was much engaged in perusing the\r\nrecords of Mr Gill's work at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nOf private history: On Jan. 24th he returned from Playford.--From June\r\n14th to July 4th he was again at Playford.--From September 21st to\r\nOctober 20th he was staying at Portinscale near Keswick.--On Dec. 23rd\r\nhe went again to Playford for his winter holiday.\r\n\r\nRespecting the agitation at Cambridge for granting University degrees\r\nto women, the following extract from a letter addressed to a young\r\nlady who had forwarded a Memorial on the subject for his\r\nconsideration, and dated Nov. 10th, 1880, contains Airy's views on\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\"I have not signed the Memorial which you sent for my consideration:\r\nand I will endeavour to tell you why. I entirely approve of education\r\nof young women to a higher pitch than they do commonly reach. I think\r\nthat they can successfully advance so far as to be able clearly to\r\nunderstand--with gratification to themselves and with advantage to\r\nthose whose education they will superintend--much of the results of\r\nthe highest class of science which have been obtained by men whose\r\nlives are in great measure devoted to it. But I do not think that\r\ntheir nature or their employments will permit of their mastering the\r\n_severe_ steps of beginning (and indeed all through) and the\r\n_complicated_ steps at the end. And I think it well that this their\r\nsuccess should be well known--as it is sure to be--among their\r\nrelatives, their friends, their visitors, and all in whom they are\r\nlikely to take interest. Their connection with such a place as Girton\r\nCollege is I think sufficient to lead to this. But I desire above all\r\nthat all this be done in entire subservience to what I regard as\r\n_infinitely_ more valuable than any amount of knowledge, namely the\r\ndelicacy of woman's character. And here, I think, our views totally\r\nseparate. I do not imagine that the University Degree would really\r\nimply, as regards education, anything more than is known to all\r\npersons (socially concerned in the happiness of the young woman) from\r\nthe less public testimonial of the able men who have the means of\r\nknowing their merits. And thus it appears to me that the admission to\r\nUniversity Degree would simply mean a more extended publication of\r\ntheir names. I dread this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1881\r\n\r\n\"The new line of underground telegraph wires has been completed by the\r\nofficers of the General Post Office. The new route is down Croom's\r\nHill in Greenwich, and the result of this change, at least as regards\r\nthe earth-current wires, and probably as regards the other wires, has\r\nnot been satisfactory. It was soon found that the indications of the\r\nearth-current wires were disturbed by a continual series of petty\r\nfluctuations which almost completely masked the proper features of\r\nearth currents.... If this fault cannot be removed, I should propose\r\nto return to our original system of independent wires (formerly to\r\nCroydon and Dartford).--The new Azimuth-mark (for the Altazimuth),\r\nupon the parapet of the Naval College, is found to be perfectly\r\nsatisfactory as regards both steadiness and visibility. The\r\nobservations of a low star for zero of azimuth have been omitted since\r\nthe beginning of 1881; the mark, in combination with a high star,\r\nappearing to give all that is necessary for this purpose.--All the\r\ninstruments have suffered from the congealing of the oil during the\r\nsevere weather of the past winter, and very thorough cleaning of all\r\nthe moving parts has been necessary.--The Solar Eclipse of 1880,\r\nDec. 31, was well observed. The first contact was observed by four\r\nobservers and the last contact by two. The computations for the\r\nobservations have been exceptionally heavy, from the circumstance that\r\nthe Sun was very low (86° 14' Z.D. at the last observation) and that\r\nit has therefore been necessary to compute the refraction with great\r\naccuracy, involving the calculation of the zenith distance for every\r\nobservation. And besides this, eighty-six separate computations of the\r\ntabular R.A. and N.P.D. of cusps have been required.--Amongst other\r\ninteresting spectroscopic observations of the Sun, a remarkable\r\nspectrum of a sun-spot shewing 17 strong black lines or bands, each as\r\nbroad as b_1, in the solar spectrum, was observed on 1880, Nov. 27 and\r\n29. These bands to which there is nothing corresponding in the Solar\r\nSpectrum (except some very faint lines) have also been subsequently\r\nremarked in the spectrum of several spots.--The Police Ship 'Royalist'\r\n(which was injured by a collision in 1879 and had been laid up in\r\ndock) has not been again moored in the river, and the series of\r\nobservations of the temperature of the Thames is thus terminated.\r\n--Part of the month of January 1881 was, as regards cold,\r\nespecially severe. The mean temperature of the period January 12 to\r\n26 (15 days) was only 24.2°, or 14.7° below the average; the\r\ntemperature fell below 20° on 10 days, and rose above the freezing\r\npoint only on 3 days. The highest temperature in this period was\r\n35.3°, the lowest 12.7°. On January 17th (while staying at Playford)\r\nmy son Hubert and I noticed an almost imperceptible movement in the\r\nupper clouds from the South-East. On that night began the terrible\r\neasterly gale, accompanied with much snow, which lasted to the night\r\nof the 18th. The limiting pressure of 50 lbs. on the square foot of\r\nOsler's Anemometer was twice exceeded during this storm.--With respect\r\nto the Diurnal Inequalities of Magnetic Horizontal Force: Assuming it\r\nto be certain that they originate from the Sun's power, not\r\nimmediately, but mediately through his action on the Earth, it appears\r\nto me (as I suggested long ago) that they are the effects of the\r\nattraction of the red end or north end of the needle by the heated\r\nportions of our globe, especially by the heated sea, whose effect\r\nappears to predominate greatly over that of the land. I do not say\r\nthat everything is thus made perfectly clear, but I think that the\r\nleading phenomena may be thus explained. And this is almost\r\nnecessarily the way of beginning a science.--In the first few years\r\nafter the strict and systematic examination of competitive\r\nchronometers, beginning with 1856, the accuracy of chronometers was\r\ngreatly increased. For many years past it has been nearly\r\nstationary. I interpret this as shewing that the effects of bad\r\nworkmanship are almost eliminated, and that future improvement must be\r\nsought in change of some points of construction.--Referring to the\r\nTransit of Venus in 1874, the printing of all sections of the\r\nObservations, with specimens of the printed forms employed, and\r\nremarks on the photographic operations, is very nearly completed. An\r\nIntroduction is begun in manuscript. I am in correspondence with the\r\nCommission which is entrusted with the arrangements for observation of\r\nthe Transit of 1882.--The Numerical Lunar Theory has been much\r\ninterrupted by the pressure of the Transit of Venus work and other\r\nbusiness.\"--In his Report to the Board of Visitors (his 46th and\r\nlast), Airy remarks that it would be a fitting opportunity for the\r\nexpression of his views on the general objects of the Observatory, and\r\non the duties which they impose on all who are actively concerned in\r\nits conduct. And this he proceeds to do in very considerable\r\ndetail.--On May 5th he wrote to Lord Northbrook (First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty) and to Mr Gladstone to resign his post of Astronomer\r\nRoyal. From time to time he was engaged on the subject of a house for\r\nhis future residence, and finally took a lease of the White House at\r\nthe top of Croom's Hill, just outside one of the gates of Greenwich\r\nPark. On the 15th of August he formally resigned his office to Mr\r\nW.H.M. Christie, who had been appointed to succeed him as Astronomer\r\nRoyal, and removed to the White House on the next day, August 16th.\r\n\r\nHis holiday movements in the portion of the year up to August 16th\r\nconsisted in his winter visit to Playford, from which he returned on\r\nJan. 24th: and a subsequent visit to Playford from June 7th to 18th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence relating to Airy's retirement from office\r\ntestifies in a remarkable manner to the estimation in which his\r\nservices were held, and to the good feeling which subsisted between\r\nhim and his official superiors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        10, DOWNING STREET, WHITEHALL,\r\n                                                     _June 6, 1881_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR GEORGE AIRY,\r\n\r\nI cannot receive the announcement of your resignation, which you have\r\njust conveyed to me, without expressing my strong sense of the\r\ndistinction you have conferred upon the office of Astronomer Royal,\r\nand of the difficulty of supplying your place with a person of equal\r\neminence. Let me add the expression of my best wishes for the full\r\nenjoyment of your retirement from responsibility.\r\n\r\n        I remain, dear Sir George Airy,\r\n          Faithfully yours,\r\n            W.E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                            ADMIRALTY,\r\n                                                  _June 10th, 1881_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, intimating\r\nyour desire to retire on the 15th August next from the office of\r\nAstronomer Royal.\r\n\r\n2. In reply I am to acquaint you that your wishes in this matter have\r\nbeen communicated to the Prime Minister, and that the further\r\nnecessary official intimation will in due course be made to the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\n3. At the same time I am instructed by their Lordships to convey to\r\nyou the expression of their high appreciation of the remarkably able\r\nand gifted manner, combined with unwearied diligence and devotion to\r\nthe Public Service (especially as regards the Department of the State\r\nover which they preside), in which you have performed the duties of\r\nAstronomer Royal throughout the long period of forty-five years.\r\n\r\n4. I am further to add that their Lordships cannot allow the present\r\nopportunity to pass without giving expression to their sense of the\r\nloss which the Public Service must sustain by your retirement, and to\r\nthe hope that you may long enjoy the rest to which you are so justly\r\nentitled.\r\n\r\n        I am, Sir,\r\n          Your obedient Servant,\r\n            ROBERT HALL.\r\n\r\n_Sir G. B. Airy, K.C.B.\r\n  &c., &c.,\r\n    Royal Observatory, Greenwich._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                            ADMIRALTY,\r\n                                                  _28th June, 1881_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nMy Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have much pleasure in\r\ntransmitting copy of a resolution passed by the Board of Visitors of\r\nthe Royal Observatory on the 4th June last, bearing testimony to the\r\nvaluable services you have rendered to Astronomy, to Navigation, and\r\nthe allied Sciences throughout the long period during which you have\r\npresided over the Royal Observatory.\r\n\r\n        I am, Sir,\r\n          Your obedient Servant,\r\n            ROBERT HALL.\r\n\r\n_Sir George Biddell Airy, K.C.B.\r\n  &c., &c., &c.,\r\n    Royal Observatory, Greenwich._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Astronomer Royal (Sir George B. Airy) having announced his\r\nintention of shortly retiring from his position at the Royal\r\nObservatory, the following resolution proposed by Professor\r\nJ. C. Adams, and seconded by Professor G. G. Stokes, was then\r\nunanimously adopted and ordered to be recorded in the Minutes of the\r\nProceedings.\r\n\r\n\"The Board having heard from the Astronomer Royal that he proposes to\r\nterminate his connection with the Observatory on the 15th of August\r\nnext, desire to record in the most emphatic manner their sense of the\r\neminent services which he has rendered to Astronomy, to Navigation and\r\nthe allied Sciences, throughout the long period of 45 years during\r\nwhich he has presided over the Royal Observatory.\r\n\r\n\"They consider that during that time he has not only maintained but\r\nhas greatly extended the ancient reputation of the Institution, and\r\nthey believe that the Astronomical and other work which has been\r\ncarried on in it under his direction will form an enduring monument of\r\nhis Scientific insight and his powers of organization.\r\n\r\n\"Among his many services to Science, the following are a few which\r\nthey desire especially to commemorate:\r\n\r\n_(a)_ \"The complete re-organization of the Equipment of the\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\n_(b)_ \"The designing of instruments of exceptional stability and\r\ndelicacy suitable for the increased accuracy of observation demanded\r\nby the advance of Astronomy.\r\n\r\n_(c)_ \"The extension of the means of making observations of the Moon\r\nin such portions of her orbit as are not accessible to the Transit\r\nCircle.\r\n\r\n_(d)_ \"The investigation of the effect of the iron of ships upon\r\ncompasses and the correction of the errors thence arising.\r\n\r\n_(e)_ \"The Establishment at the Observatory and elsewhere of a System\r\nof Time Signals since extensively developed by the Government.\r\n\r\n\"The Board feel it their duty to add that Sir George Airy has at all\r\ntimes devoted himself in the most unsparing manner to the business of\r\nthe Observatory, and has watched over its interests with an assiduity\r\ninspired by the strongest personal attachment to the Institution. He\r\nhas availed himself zealously of every scientific discovery and\r\ninvention which was in his judgment capable of adaptation to the work\r\nof the Observatory; and the long series of his annual reports to the\r\nBoard of Visitors furnish abundant evidence, if such were needed, of\r\nthe soundness of his judgment in the appreciation of suggested\r\nchanges, and of his readiness to introduce improvements when the\r\nproper time arrived. While maintaining the most remarkable punctuality\r\nin the reduction and publication of the observations made under his\r\nown superintendance, he had reduced, collected, and thus rendered\r\navailable for use by astronomers, the Lunar and Planetary Observations\r\nof his predecessors. Nor can it be forgotten that, notwithstanding his\r\nabsorbing occupations, his advice and assistance have always been at\r\nthe disposal of Astronomers for any work of importance.\r\n\r\n\"To refer in detail to his labours in departments of Science not\r\ndirectly connected with the Royal Observatory may seem to lie beyond\r\nthe province of the Board. But it cannot be improper to state that its\r\nmembers are not unacquainted with the high estimation in which his\r\ncontributions to the Theory of Tides, to the undulatory theory of\r\nLight, and to various abstract branches of Mathematics are held by men\r\nof Science throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion the Board would express their earnest hope, that in his\r\nretirement Sir George Airy may enjoy health and strength and that\r\nleisure for which he has often expressed a desire to enable him not\r\nonly to complete the numerical Lunar Theory on which he has been\r\nengaged for some years past, but also to advance Astronomical Science\r\nin other directions.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                            ADMIRALTY,\r\n                                               _27th October, 1881_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit\r\nto you, herewith, a copy of a Treasury Minute, awarding you a Special\r\nPension of _£1100_ a year, in consideration of your long and brilliant\r\nservices as Astronomer Royal.\r\n\r\n        I am, Sir,\r\n          Your obedient Servant,\r\n            ROBERT HALL.\r\n\r\n_Sir G.B.

Airy as Astronomer Royal is _£1200_ a year, in\r\naddition to which he enjoys an official residence rent free, and,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances he would be entitled to a pension equal\r\nto two-thirds of his salary and emoluments.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, however, in order to mark their strong sense of the\r\ndistinction which, during a long and brilliant career Sir George Airy\r\nhas conferred upon his office, and of the great services which, in\r\nconnection with, as well as in the discharge of, his duties, he has\r\nrendered to the Crown and the Public, decide to deal with his case\r\nunder the IXth Section of the Superannuation Act, 1859, which empowers\r\nthem to grant a special pension for special services.\r\n\r\nAccordingly my Lords are pleased to award to Sir George Biddell Airy,\r\nK.C.B., F.R.S., a special Retired Allowance of _£1100_ per annum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                  THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n                                              CROOM'S HILL, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                 _1881, October 29_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have the honour to acknowledge your letter of October 27,\r\ntransmitting to me, by instruction of The Lords Commissioners of\r\nAdmiralty, copy of a Treasury Minute dated 1881 October 10, in which\r\nthe Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury are pleased to award\r\nto me an annual retired allowance of _£1100_ per annum.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the very liberal award of the Lords Commissioners of\r\nTreasury, and the honourable and acceptable terms in which it is\r\nannounced, I take leave at the same time to offer to Their Lordships\r\nof the Admiralty my recognition of Their Lordships' kindness and\r\ncourtesy in thus handing to me copy of the Treasury Minute.\r\n\r\n        I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n          Your very obedient Servant,\r\n            G.B.

AIRY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThroughout his tenure of office Airy had cultivated and maintained the\r\nmost friendly relations with foreign astronomers, to the great\r\nadvantage of the Observatory. Probably all of them, at one time or\r\nanother, had visited Greenwich, and to most of them he was well\r\nknown. On his retirement from office he received an illuminated\r\nAddress from his old friend Otto Struve and the staff of the Pulkowa\r\nObservatory, an illuminated Address from the Vorstand of the\r\nAstronomische Gesellschaft at Berlin signed by Dr Auwers and the\r\nSecretaries, a complimentary letter from the Academy of Sciences at\r\nAmsterdam, and friendly letters of sympathy from Dr Gould,\r\nProf. Newcombe, Dr Listing, and from many other scientific friends and\r\nsocieties. His replies to the Russian and German Addresses were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                   _1881, August 5_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI received, with feelings which I will not attempt to describe, the\r\nAddress of yourself and the Astronomers of Pulkowa generally, on the\r\noccasion of my retirement from the office of Astronomer Royal. I can\r\nscarcely credit myself with possessing all the varied claims to your\r\nscientific regard which you detail. I must be permitted to attribute\r\nmany of them to the long and warm friendship which has subsisted so\r\nlong between the Directors of the Pulkowa Observatory and myself, and\r\nwhich has influenced the feelings of the whole body of Astronomers\r\nattached to that Institution. On one point, however, I willingly\r\naccept your favourable expressions--I have not been sparing of my\r\npersonal labour--and to this I must attribute partial success on some\r\nof the subjects to which you allude.\r\n\r\nIn glancing over the marginal list of scientific pursuits, I remark\r\nwith pleasure the reference to _Optics_. I still recur with delight to\r\nthe Undulatory Theory, once the branch of science on which I was best\r\nknown to the world, and which by calculations, writings, and lectures,\r\nI supported against the Laplacian School. But the close of your\r\nremarks touches me much more--the association of the name of W. Struve\r\nand my own. I respected deeply the whole character of your Father, and\r\nI believe that he had confidence in me. From our first meeting in 1830\r\n(on a Commission for improvement of the Nautical Almanac) I never\r\nceased to regard him as superior to others. I may be permitted to add\r\nthat the delivery of his authority to the hands of his son has not\r\nweakened the connection of myself with the Observatory of Poulkova.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging gratefully your kindness, and that of all the\r\nAstronomers of the Observatory of Poulkova, and requesting you to\r\nconvey to them this expression,\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Yours most truly,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_To M. Otto von Struve,\r\n  Director of the Observatory of Poulkova\r\n    and the Astronomers of that Observatory._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                         ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH,\r\n                                                   _1881, August 3_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWith very great pleasure I received the Address of the Astronomische\r\nGesellschaft on occasion of my intended resignation of the Office of\r\nAstronomer Royal: dated July 27, and signed by yourself as President\r\nand Messrs Schoenfeld and Winnecke as Secretaries of the Astronomische\r\nGesellschaft. I thank you much for the delicacy of your arrangement\r\nfor the transmission of this document by the hands of our friend Dr\r\nHuggins. And I think you will be gratified to learn that it arrived at\r\na moment when I was surrounded by my whole family assembled at my\r\n_jour-de-fête_, and that it added greatly to the happiness of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nI may perhaps permit myself to accept your kind recognition of my\r\ndevotion of time and thought to the interests of my Science and my\r\nOffice. It is full reward to me that they are so recognized. As to\r\nthe success or utility of these efforts, without presuming, myself, to\r\nform an opinion, I acknowledge that the connection made by the\r\nAstronomische Gesellschaft, between my name and the advance of modern\r\nastronomy, is most flattering, and will always be remembered by me\r\nwith pride.\r\n\r\nIt is true, as is suggested in your Address, that one motive for my\r\nresignation of Office was the desire to find myself more free for the\r\nprosecution of further astronomical investigations. Should my health\r\nremain unbroken, I hope to enter shortly upon this undertaking.\r\n\r\nAgain acknowledging the kindness of yourself and the Vorstand of the\r\nAstronomische Gesellschaft, and offering my best wishes for the\r\ncontinued success of that honourable institution,\r\n\r\n        I am, my dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very truly,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_To Dr Aimers\r\nand the Vorstand of the\r\nAstronomische Gesellschaft._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n         AT THE WHITE HOUSE, GREENWICH. FROM HIS RESIGNATION\r\n                OF OFFICE ON AUGUST 15TH, 1881, TO HIS\r\n                     DEATH ON JANUARY 2ND, 1892.\r\n\r\n             HISTORY OF HIS LIFE AFTER HIS RESIGNATION OF\r\n                               OFFICE.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August 1881 Airy left the Observatory which had been\r\nhis residence for nearly 46 years, and removed to the White\r\nHouse. Whatever his feelings may have been at the severing of his old\r\nassociations he carefully kept them to himself, and entered upon his\r\nnew life with the cheerful composure and steadiness of temper which he\r\npossessed in a remarkable degree. He was now more than 80 years old,\r\nand the cares of office had begun to weigh heavily upon him: the\r\nlong-continued drag of the Transit of Venus work had wearied him, and\r\nhe was anxious to carry on and if possible complete his Numerical\r\nLunar Theory, the great work which for some years had occupied much of\r\nhis time and attention. His mental powers were still vigorous, and his\r\nenergy but little impaired: his strong constitution, his regular\r\nhabits of life, the systematic relief which he obtained by short\r\nholiday expeditions whenever he found himself worn with work, and his\r\nkeen interest in history, poetry, classics, antiquities, engineering,\r\nand other subjects not immediately connected with his profession, had\r\ncombined to produce this result. And in leaving office, he had no idea\r\nof leaving off work; his resignation of office merely meant for him a\r\nchange of work. It is needless to say that his interest in the welfare\r\nand progress of the Observatory was as keen as ever; his advice was\r\nalways at the service of his successor, and his appointment as Visitor\r\na year or two after his resignation gave him an official position with\r\nregard to the Observatory which he much valued. The White House, which\r\nwas to be his home for the rest of his life, is just outside one of\r\nthe upper gates of the Park, and about a quarter of a mile from the\r\nObservatory. Here he resided with his two unmarried daughters. The\r\nhouse suited him well and he was very comfortable there: he preferred\r\nto live in the neighbourhood with which he was so familiar and in\r\nwhich he was so well known, rather than to remove to a distance. His\r\ndaily habits of life were but little altered: he worked steadily as\r\nformerly, took his daily walk on Blackheath, made frequent visits to\r\nPlayford, and occasional expeditions to the Cumberland Lakes and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe work to which he chiefly devoted himself in his retirement was the\r\ncompletion of his Numerical Lunar Theory. This was a vast work,\r\ninvolving the subtlest considerations of principle, very long and\r\nelaborate mathematical investigations of a high order, and an enormous\r\namount of arithmetical computation. The issue of it was unfortunate:\r\nhe concluded that there was an error in some of the early work, which\r\nvitiated the results obtained: and although the whole process was\r\npublished, and was left in such a state that it would be a\r\ncomparatively simple task for a future astronomer to correct and\r\ncomplete it, yet it was not permitted to the original author of it to\r\ndo this. To avoid the necessity of frequent reference to this work in\r\nthe history of Airy's remaining years, it will be convenient to\r\nsummarize it here. It was commenced in 1872: \"On Feb. 23rd in this\r\nyear I first (privately) formed the notion of preparing a Numerical\r\nLunar Theory by substituting Delaunay's numbers in the proper\r\nEquations and seeing what would come of it.\" From this time forward\r\ntill his power to continue it absolutely failed, he pursued the\r\nsubject with his usual tenacity of purpose. During his tenure of\r\noffice every available opportunity was seized for making progress with\r\nhis Lunar Theory, and in every Report to the Visitors a careful\r\nstatement was inserted of the state in which it then stood. And, after\r\nhis resignation of office, it formed the bulk of his occupation. In\r\n1873 the Theory was formed, and by 1874 it was so far advanced that he\r\npublished in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society a\r\nstatement of the fundamental points of the Theory. In 1875, the\r\nTheory having advanced to a stage where extensive arithmetical\r\ncomputation was required, he obtained a small grant from the\r\nGovernment in aid of the expense of the work, and other grants were\r\nmade in subsequent years. By 1878 the calculations were so far\r\nadvanced that an opinion could be formed as to the probable accuracy\r\nof the Theory, and the following remark is made: \"A cursory collation\r\nof the terms relating to the Areas (in the Ecliptic) led me to suppose\r\nthat there might be some error in the computations of the Annual\r\nEquation and related terms;\" but no error could be discovered and the\r\nwork proceeded. The complex character of the Theory, and the extreme\r\ncare required in the mathematical processes, are well illustrated by\r\nthe following statement, which occurs in the Report of 1879, \"An\r\nimportant error in the theoretical formulae for Variations of Radius\r\nVector, Longitude, and Latitude, was discovered; some calculations\r\ndepending on them are cancelled.\"  In 1880 and 1881 the work was\r\ncontinued, but was \"sadly interrupted by the pressure of the Transit\r\nof Venus work and other business.\" After his resignation of the Office\r\nof Astronomer Royal he had no further public assistance, and did much\r\nof the computations himself, but a sum of _£100_ was contributed by Mr\r\nDe La Rue in furtherance of the work, and this sum was spent on\r\ncomputers. In his retirement the work made good progress, and on\r\nDec. 31st, 1882, he made the following note: \"I finished and put in\r\ngeneral order the final tables of Equations of Variations. This is a\r\ndefinite point in the Lunar Theory.... I hope shortly to take up\r\nseverely the numerical operations of the Lunar Theory from the very\r\nbeginning.\" The work was continued steadily through 1883, and on\r\nMar. 24th, 1884, he made application through the Board of Visitors to\r\nthe Admiralty to print the work: after the usual enquiries as to the\r\nexpense this was acceded to, and copy was sent to the printers as soon\r\nas it was ready. The first printed proofs were received on Feb. 5th,\r\n1885, and the whole book was printed by the end of 1886. From the\r\nfrequent references in his journal to errors discovered and corrected\r\nduring the progress of these calculations, it would seem likely that\r\nhis powers were not what they had been, and that there was a\r\nprobability that some important errors might escape correction. He\r\nwas far too honest to blind himself to this possibility, and in the\r\nPreface to his Numerical Lunar Theory he says thus: \"I have explained\r\nabove that the principle of operations was, to arrange the fundamental\r\nmechanical equations in a form suited for the investigations of Lunar\r\nTheory; to substitute in the terms of these equations the numerical\r\nvalues furnished by Delaunay's great work; and to examine whether the\r\nequations are thereby satisfied. With painful alarm, I find that they\r\nare not satisfied; and that the discordance, or failure of satisfying\r\nthe equations, is large. The critical trial depends on the great mass\r\nof computations in Section II. These have been made in duplicate, with\r\nall the care for accuracy that anxiety could supply. Still I cannot\r\nbut fear that the error which is the source of discordance must be on\r\nmy part. I cannot conjecture whether I may be able to examine\r\nsufficiently into this matter.\" He resolutely took in hand the\r\nrevision of his work, and continued it till October 1888. But it is\r\nclear from the entries in his journal that his powers were now unequal\r\nto the task, and although from time to time he suspected that he had\r\ndiscovered errors, yet it does not appear that he determined anything\r\nwith certainty. He never doubted that there were important errors in\r\nthe work, and later on he left the following private note on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n                       NUMERICAL LUNAR THEORY.\r\n\r\n                                                   _1890, Sept. 29_.\r\n\r\nI had made considerable advance (under official difficulties) in\r\ncalculations on my favourite Numerical Lunar Theory, when I discovered\r\nthat, under the heavy pressure of unusual matters (two Transits of\r\nVenus and some eclipses) I had committed a grievous error in the first\r\nstage of giving numerical value to my Theory.\r\n\r\nMy spirit in the work was broken, and I have never heartily proceeded\r\nwith it since.\r\n\r\n                                                            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\nProbably the error referred to here is the suspected error mentioned\r\nabove in his Report of 1878, as to which he subsequently became more\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the imperfections of the Numerical Lunar Theory, it is\r\na wonderful work to have been turned out by a man 85 years old. In its\r\nidea and inception it embodies the experience of a long life actively\r\nspent in practical science. And it may be that it will yet fulfil the\r\nobjects of its author, and that some younger astronomer may take it\r\nup, correct its errors (wherever they may be), and fit it for\r\npractical use. And then the labour bestowed upon it will not have\r\nbeen in vain.\r\n\r\nSubject always to the absorbing occupations of the Lunar Theory he\r\namused himself with reading his favourite subjects of History and\r\nAntiquities. His movements during the remainder of the year 1881 were\r\nas follows: In September he paid a two days' visit to Lady Herschel at\r\nHawkhurst. From Oct. 4th to 17th he was at the Cumberland Lakes and\r\nengaged in expeditions in the neighbourhood. From Nov. 5th to 8th he\r\nwas at Cambridge, inspecting Prof. Stuart's workshops, and other\r\nscientific institutions. On Dec. 13th he went to Playford.--Amongst\r\nmiscellaneous matters: in November he wrote to Mr Rothery on the loss\r\nof the 'Teuton' at some length, with suggestions for the safer\r\nconstruction of such vessels.--In October he was asked for suggestions\r\nregarding the establishment of a \"Standard Time\" applicable to the\r\nrailway traffic in the United States: he replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _1881, Oct. 31_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge your letter of October 17, introducing to my\r\nnotice the difficulty which appears to be arising in America regarding\r\na \"Standard Time,\" for extensive use throughout N. America\r\n\"applicable to railway traffic only.\" The subject, as including\r\nconsiderations of convenience in all the matters to which it applies,\r\nis one of difficulties probably insuperable. The certainty, however,\r\nthat objections may be raised to every scheme, renders me less timid\r\nin offering my own remarks; which are much at your service.\r\n\r\nI first comment upon your expression of \"Standard Time... applicable\r\nto railway traffic only.\" But do you mean this as affecting the\r\ntransactions between one railway and another railway, or as affecting\r\neach railway and the local interests (temporal and others) of the\r\ntowns which it touches? The difference is so great that I should be\r\ndisposed to adopt it as marking very strongly the difference to be\r\nmade between the practices of railways among themselves and the\r\npractices of railways towards the public; and will base a system on\r\nthat difference.\r\n\r\nAs regards the practices of railways among themselves: if the various\r\nrailways of America are joined and inosculated as they are in England,\r\nit appears to me indispensable that they have one common standard\r\n_among themselves_: say Washington Observatory time. But this is only\r\nneeded for the office-transactions between the railways; it may be\r\nkept perfectly private; never communicated to the public at all. And I\r\nshould recommend this as the first step.\r\n\r\nThere will then be no difficulty in deducing, from these private\r\nWashington times, the accurate local times at those stations (whose\r\nlongitude is supposed to be fairly well known, as a sailor with a\r\nsextant can determine one in a few hours) which the railway\r\nauthorities may deem worthy of that honour; generally the termini of\r\nrailways. Thus we shall have a series of bases of local time, of\r\nauthoritative character, through the country.\r\n\r\nOf such bases _we_ have two, Greenwich and Dublin: and they are\r\nseparated by a sea-voyage. In the U.S. of America there must be a\r\ngreater number, and probably not so well separated. Still it is\r\nindispensable to adopt such a system of local centers.\r\n\r\nNo people in this world can be induced to use a reckoning which does\r\nnot depend clearly upon the sun. In all civilized countries it depends\r\n(approximately) on the sun's meridian passage. Even the sailor on\r\nmid-ocean refers to that phenomenon. And the solar passage, with\r\nreasonable allowance, 20m. or 30m. one way or another, must be\r\nrecognized in all time-arrangements as giving the fundamental\r\ntime. The only practical way of doing this is, to adopt for a whole\r\nregion the fundamental time of a center of that region.\r\n\r\nAnd to this fundamental time, the local time of the railway, as now\r\nentering into all the concerns of life, must be adapted. A solicitor\r\nhas an appointment to meet a client by railway; a physician to a\r\nconsultation. How is this to be kept if the railway uses one time and\r\nevery other act of life another?\r\n\r\nThere is one chain of circumstances which is almost peculiar--that of\r\nthe line from New York to San Francisco. Here I would have two clocks\r\nat every station: those on the north side all shewing San Francisco\r\ntime, and those on the south all shewing New York time. Every\r\ntraveller's watch would then be available to the end of his journey.\r\n\r\nA system, fundamentally such as I have sketched, would give little\r\ntrouble, and may I think be adopted with advantage.\r\n\r\n        I am, Sir,\r\n          Your faithful servant,\r\n            G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_Mr Edward Barrington._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1882\r\n\r\nHe returned from Playford on Jan. 17: his other movements during the\r\nyear were as follows: from Apr. 27th to May 11th he was at Playford;\r\nand again from August 1st to 24th. From Oct. 9th to Nov. 1st he was\r\ntravelling with his two unmarried daughters in the Lake District of\r\nCumberland: the journey was by Furness and Coniston to Portinscale\r\nnear Keswick; on Oct. 13th he fell and sprained his ankle, and his\r\nexcursions for the rest of the time were mainly conducted by\r\ndriving. Shortly after his return, on Nov. 11th, while walking alone\r\non Blackheath, he was seized with a violent attack of illness, and lay\r\nhelpless for some time before he was found and brought home: he seems\r\nhowever to have recovered to a great extent in the course of a day or\r\ntwo, and continued his Lunar Theory and other work as before. On June\r\n22nd he made the following sad note, \"This morning, died after a most\r\npainful illness my much-loved daughter-in-law, Anna Airy, daughter of\r\nProfessor Listing of Göttingen, wife of my eldest son Wilfrid.\" In\r\nFebruary he wrote out his reminiscences of the village of Playford\r\nduring his boyhood.\r\n\r\nIn June he was much disturbed in mind on hearing of some important\r\nalterations made by the Astronomer Royal in the Collimators of the\r\nTransit Circle, and some correspondence ensued on the subject.--During\r\nthe year he had much correspondence on the subject of the subsidences\r\non Blackheath.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written in reply to a gentleman who had asked\r\nwhether it could be ascertained by calculation how long it is since\r\nthe Glacial Period existed:\r\n\r\n                                                     _1882, July 4_.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI should have much pleasure in fully answering your questions of July\r\n3 if I were able to do so: but the subject really is very obscure.\r\n\r\n(1) Though it is recognized that the glacial period (or periods) is\r\nlate, I do not think that any one has ventured to fix upon a rude\r\nnumber of years since elapsed.\r\n\r\n(2) We have no reason to think that the mean distance of the earth\r\nfrom the sun has sensibly altered. There have been changes in the\r\neccentricity of the orbit (making the earth's distance from the sun\r\nless in one month and greater in the opposite month), but I do not\r\nperceive that this would explain glaciers.\r\n\r\n(3) I consider it to be certain that the whole surface of the earth,\r\nat a very distant period, was very hot, that it has cooled gradually,\r\nand (theoretically and imperceptibly) is cooling still. The glaciers\r\nmust be later than these hot times, and later than our last\r\nconsolidated strata: but this is nearly all that I can say.\r\n\r\n        I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,\r\n          G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n_James Alston, Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1883\r\n\r\nFrom May 2nd to 29th he was at Playford. From July 10th to 20th he was\r\ntravelling in South Wales with his daughters.--From Oct. 10th to\r\nNov. 10th he was at Playford.--Between Nov. 20th of this year and\r\nJan. 4th of the year 1884, he sat several times to Mr John Collier for\r\nhis portrait: the picture was exhibited in the Academy of 1884; it is\r\na most successful and excellent likeness.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year he was very busy with the Numerical Lunar\r\nTheory.--In March he was officially asked to accept the office of\r\nVisitor of the Royal Observatory, which he accepted, and in this\r\ncapacity attended at the Annual Visitation on June 2nd, and addressed\r\na Memorandum to the Visitors on the progress of his Lunar Theory.--On\r\nMarch 12th he published in several newspapers a statement in\r\nopposition to the proposed Braithwaite and Buttermere Railway, which\r\nhe considered would be injurious to the Lake District, in which he\r\ntook so deep an interest.--In May he communicated to \"The Observatory\"\r\na statement of his objections to a Theory advanced by Mr Stone (then\r\nPresident of the Royal Astronomical Society) to account for the\r\nrecognized inequality in the Mean Motion of the Moon. This Theory, on\r\na subject to which Airy had given his incessant attention for so many\r\nyears, would naturally receive his careful attention and criticism,\r\nand it attracted much general notice at the time.--In December he\r\nwrote to the Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society his opinion\r\nas to the award of the Medal of the Society. In this letter he stated\r\nthe principles which guided him as follows: \"I have always maintained\r\nthat the award of the Medal ought to be guided mainly by the\r\noriginality of communications: that one advance in a new direction\r\nought in our decision to outweigh any mass of work in a routine\r\nalready established: and that, in any case, scientific utility as\r\ndistinguished from mere elegance is indispensable.\"--In July\r\nLieut. Pinheiro of the Brazilian Navy called with an autograph letter\r\nof introduction from the Emperor of Brazil. The Lieutenant desired to\r\nmake himself acquainted with the English system of Lighthouses and\r\nMeteorology, and Airy took much trouble in providing him with\r\nintroductions through which he received every facility for the\r\nthorough accomplishment of his object.--On Oct. 8th he forwarded to\r\nProf. Cayley proofs of Euclid's Propositions I. 47 and III. 35 with\r\nthe following remarks: \"I place on the other side the propositions\r\nwhich may be substituted (with knowledge of Euclid's VI. book) for the\r\ntwo celebrated propositions of the geometrical books. They leave on my\r\nmind no doubt whatever that they were invented as proofs by ratios,\r\nand that they were then violently expanded into cumbrous geometrical\r\nproofs.\"--On June 28th he declined to sign a memorial asking for the\r\ninterment of Mr Spottiswoode in Westminster Abbey, stating as his\r\nreason, \"I take it, that interment possessing such a public character\r\nis a public recognition of benefits, political, literary, or\r\nphilosophical, whose effects will be great and durable. Now I doubt\r\nwhether it can be stated that Mr Spottiswoode had conferred such\r\nbenefits on Society. \"But he adds at length his cordial recognition of\r\nMr Spottiswoode's scientific services.--Throughout his life Airy was a\r\nregular attendant at church, and took much interest in the conduct of\r\nthe Church services. In October of this year he wrote a long letter\r\nto the Vicar of Greenwich on various points, in which occurs the\r\nfollowing paragraph: \"But there is one matter in the present form of\r\nthe Church Service, on which my feeling is very strong, namely the\r\n(so-called, I believe) Choral Service, in the Confession, the Prayer,\r\nand the Creed. I have long listened with veneration to our noble\r\nLiturgy, and I have always been struck with the deep personally\r\nreligious feeling which pervades it, especially those parts of it\r\nwhich are for 'The People.' And an earnest Priest, earnestly pressing\r\nthese parts by his vocal example on the notice of the People, can\r\nscarcely fail to excite a corresponding earnestness in them. All this\r\nis totally lost in the choral system. For a venerable persuasion there\r\nis substituted a rude irreverential confusion of voices; for an\r\nearnest acceptance of the form offered by the Priest there is\r\nsubstituted--in my feeling at least--a weary waiting for the end of an\r\nunmeaning form.\" He also objected much to singing the responses to the\r\nCommandments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1884\r\n\r\nFrom Apr. 29th to May 30th he was at Playford, concluding his Journal\r\nthere with the note \"So ends a pleasant Vacation.\"--On June 11th he\r\nwent to Cambridge and attended the Trinity College Commemoration\r\nService, and dined in Hall.--From Aug. 14th to Sept. 11th he was at\r\nPlayford.--On Sept. 26th he made an expedition to Guildford and\r\nFarnham.--During this year he was closely engaged on the Numerical\r\nLunar Theory, and for relaxation was reading theology and sundry books\r\nof the Old Testament.\r\n\r\nOn June 7th he attended at the Visitation of the Royal\r\nObservatory.--In a letter written in April to Lt.-Col. Marindin, R.A.,\r\non the subject of wind pressure there occurs the following remark:\r\n\"When the heavy gusts come on, the wind is blowing in directions\r\nchanging rapidly, but limited in extent. My conclusion is that in\r\narches of small extent (as in the Tay Bridge) every thing must be\r\ncalculated for full pressure; but in arches of large extent (as in the\r\nForth Bridge) every thing may be calculated for small pressure. And\r\nfor a suspension bridge the pressure is far less dangerous than for a\r\nstiff arch.\"--In January he had some correspondence with Professor\r\nTyndall on the Theory of the \"White Rainbow,\" and stated that he\r\nthoroughly agreed with Dr Young's explanation of this phaenomenon.\r\n--The following is extracted from a letter on May 1st to\r\nhis old friend Otto Struve: \"I received from you about 3 or 4 weeks\r\npast a sign of your friendly remembrance, a copy of your paper on the\r\nAnnual Parallax of Aldebaran. It pleased me much. Especially I was\r\ndelighted with your noble retention of the one equation whose result\r\ndiffered so sensibly from that of the other equations. It is quite\r\npossible, even probable, that the mean result is improved by it. I\r\nhave known such instances. The first, which attracted much attention,\r\nwas Capt. Kater's attempt to establish a scale of longitude in England\r\nby reciprocal observations of azimuth between Beachy Head and\r\nDunnose. The result was evidently erroneous. But Colonel Colby, on\r\nexamination of the original papers, found that some observations had\r\nbeen omitted, as suspicious; and that when these were included the\r\nmean agreed well with the scale of observation inferred from other\r\nmethods.\"--In a letter to the Rev. R.C.M. Rouse, acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of a geometrical book, there occurs the following paragraph:\r\n\"I do not value Euclid's Elements as a super-excellent book of\r\ninstruction--though some important points are better presented in it\r\nthan in any other book of geometrical instruction that I have\r\nseen. But I value it as a book of strong and distinct reasoning, and\r\nof orderly succession of reasonings. I do not think that there is any\r\nbook in the world which presents so distinctly the 'because......\r\ntherefore.......' And this is invaluable for the mental\r\neducation of youth.\"--In May he was in correspondence with Professor\r\nBalfour Stewart regarding a projected movement in Terrestrial\r\nMagnetism to be submitted to the British Association. Airy cordially\r\napproved of this movement, and supported it to the best of his\r\nability, stating that in his opinion what was mainly wanted was the\r\ncollation of existing records.--In January and February he was much\r\npressed by Prof. Pritchard of Oxford to give his opinion as to the\r\nincorrectness of statements made by Dr Kinns in his Lectures on the\r\nScientific Accuracy of the Bible. Airy refused absolutely to take part\r\nin the controversy, but he could not escape from the correspondence\r\nwhich the matter involved: and this led up to other points connected\r\nwith the early history of the Israelites, a subject in which he took\r\nmuch interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1885\r\n\r\nFrom May 4th to June 3rd he was at Playford.--From July 2nd to 22nd he\r\nwas in the Lake District. The journey was by Windermere to Kentmere,\r\nwhere he made enquiries concerning the Airy family, as it had been\r\nconcluded with much probability from investigations made by his\r\nnephew, the Rev. Basil R. Airy, that the family was settled there at a\r\nvery early date. Some persons of the name of Airy were still living\r\nthere. He then went on by Coniston and Grasmere to Portinscale, and\r\nspent the rest of his time in expeditions amongst the hills and visits\r\nto friends.--On July 28th he went to Woodbridge in Suffolk and\r\ndistributed the prizes to the boys of the Grammar School there.--From\r\nOct. 9th to Nov. 12th he was again at Playford.--Throughout the year\r\nhe was busily engaged on the Numerical Lunar Theory, and found but\r\nlittle time for miscellaneous reading.\r\n\r\nOf printed papers by Airy in this year the most important was one on\r\nthe \"Results deduced from the Measures of Terrestrial Magnetic Force\r\nin the Horizontal Plane,\" &c. This was a long Paper, communicated to\r\nthe Royal Society, and published in the Phil. Trans., and was the last\r\nScientific Paper of any importance (except the Volume of the Numerical\r\nLunar Theory) in the long list of \"Papers by G.B. Airy.\" The\r\npreparation of this Paper took much time.--Of miscellaneous matters:\r\nIn May a Committee of the Royal Society had been appointed to advise\r\nthe India Office as to the publication of Col. J. Herschel's pendulum\r\nobservations in India; and Airy was asked to assist the Committee with\r\nhis advice. He gave very careful and anxious consideration to the\r\nsubject, and it occupied much time.--In the early part of the year he\r\nwas asked by Sir William Thomson to assist him with an affidavit in a\r\nlawsuit concerning an alleged infringement of one of his Patents for\r\nthe improvement of the Compass. Airy declined to make an affidavit or\r\nto take sides in the dispute, but he wrote a letter from which the\r\nfollowing is extracted: \"I cannot have the least difficulty in\r\nexpressing my opinion that you have made a great advance in the\r\napplication of my method of correcting the compass in iron ships, by\r\nyour introduction of the use of short needles for the compass-cards.\r\nIn my original investigations, when the whole subject was in darkness,\r\nI could only use existing means for experiment, namely the long-needle\r\ncompasses then existing. But when I applied mechanical theory to\r\nexplanation of the results, I felt grievously the deficiency of a\r\ntheory and the construction which it suggested (necessarily founded on\r\nassumption that the proportion of the needle-length to the other\r\nelements of measure is small) when the length of the needles was\r\nreally so great. I should possibly have used some construction like\r\nyours, but the Government had not then a single iron vessel, and did\r\nnot seem disposed to urge the enquiry. You, under happier auspices,\r\nhave successfully carried it out, and, I fully believe, with much\r\nadvantage to the science.\"--He wrote a Paper for the Athenaeum and had\r\nvarious correspondence on the subject of the Badbury Rings in\r\nDorsetshire, which he (and others) considered as identical with the\r\n\"Mons Badonicus\" of Gildas, the site of an ancient British battle.--In\r\nFebruary he was in correspondence with the Astronomer Royal on Uniform\r\nTime Reckoning, and on considerations relating to it.--On June 6th he\r\nattended the Annual Visitation of the Observatory, and brought before\r\nthe Board his investigations of the Diurnal Magnetic Inequalities, and\r\nthe revises of his Lunar Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1886\r\n\r\nFrom June 8th to July 17th he was at Playford.--And again at Playford\r\nfrom Oct. 5th to Nov. 8th.--On March 27th he had an attack of gout in\r\nhis right foot, which continued through April and into May, causing\r\nhim much inconvenience.--He was busy with the Numerical Lunar Theory\r\nup to Sept. 25th, when he was reading the last proof-sheet received\r\nfrom the printers: during this period his powers were evidently\r\nfailing, and there are frequent references to errors discovered and\r\ncorrected, and to uncertainties connected with points of the\r\nTheory. But his great work on the Numerical Lunar Theory was printed\r\nin this year: and there can be no doubt that he experienced a great\r\nfeeling of relief when this was accomplished.--He was in\r\ncorrespondence with Prof. Adams as to the effect of his reduction of\r\nthe Coefficient of Lunar Acceleration on the calculation of the\r\nancient historical eclipses.--He compiled a Paper \"On the\r\nestablishment of the Roman dominion in England,\" which was printed in\r\n1887.--He wrote a notice concerning events in the life of Mr John\r\nJackson of Rosthwaite near Keswick, a well-known guide and\r\nmuch-respected authority on matters relating to the Lake District.--He\r\nalso wrote a short account of the connection of the history of Mdlle\r\nde Quéroualle with that of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.--On\r\nJune 4th he attended at the Annual Visitation of the Observatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1887\r\n\r\nOn May 9th to 11th he made a short visit to Eastbourne and the\r\nneighbourhood.--From June 8th to July 13th he was at Playford.--From\r\nAug. 29th to Sept. 5th he was travelling in Dorsetshire and Wiltshire:\r\nhe went first to Weymouth, a very favourite centre for excursions with\r\nhim, and afterwards visited Bridport and Lyme Regis: then by\r\nDorchester to Blandford, and visited the Hod Hill, Badbury Rings, &c.:\r\nat Wimborne he was much interested in the architecture of the church:\r\nlastly he visited Salisbury, Old Sarum, Stonehenge, &c., and returned\r\nto Greenwich.--From Oct. 11th to Nov. 12th he was at Playford.--During\r\nthis year he partly occupied himself with arranging his papers and\r\ndrawings, and with miscellaneous reading. But he could not withdraw\r\nhis thoughts from his Lunar Theory, and he still continued to struggle\r\nwith the difficulties of the subject, and was constantly scheming\r\nimprovements. His private accounts also now gave him much\r\ntrouble. Throughout his life he had been accustomed to keep his\r\naccounts by double entry in very perfect order. But he now began to\r\nmake mistakes and to grow confused, and this distressed him\r\ngreatly. It never seemed to occur to him to abandon his elaborate\r\nsystem of accounts, and to content himself with simple entries of\r\nreceipts and expenses. This would have been utterly opposed to his\r\nsense of order, which was now more than ever the ruling principle of\r\nhis mind. And so he struggled with his accounts as he did with his\r\nLunar Theory till his powers absolutely failed. In his Journal for\r\nthis year there are various entries of mental attacks of short\r\nduration and other ailments ascribable to his advanced age.\r\n\r\nThe last printed \"Papers by G.B. Airy\" belong to this year. One was\r\nthe Paper before referred to \"On the establishment of the Roman\r\ndominion in England\": another was on the solution of a certain\r\nEquation: and there were early reminiscences of the Cambridge Tripos,\r\n&c.--In February he attended a little to a new edition of his Ipswich\r\nLectures, but soon handed it over to Mr H.H. Turner of the Royal\r\nObservatory.--On May 23rd he was drawing up suggestions for the\r\narrangement of the Seckford School, &c., at Woodbridge.--On June 4th\r\nhe attended the Visitation of the Royal Observatory, when a resolution\r\nwas passed in favour of complete photography of the star-sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1888\r\n\r\nFrom the 14th to 16th of May he made a short expedition to\r\nBournemouth, and stopped on the way home to visit Winchester\r\nCathedral.--From June 27th to Aug. 3rd he was at Playford; and again\r\nfrom Oct. 13th to Nov. 10th.--During the first half of the year he\r\ncontinued his examination of his Lunar Theory, but gradually dropped\r\nit. There are several references in his Journal to his feelings of\r\npain and weakness, both mental and bodily: at the end of March he had\r\nan attack of gout in the fingers of his right hand. During the latter\r\npart of the year he was troubled with his private accounts, as\r\nbefore.--He does not appear to have been engaged on any miscellaneous\r\nmatters calling for special notice in this year. But he kept up his\r\nastronomical correspondence--with Lockyer on the meteorite system of\r\nplanetary formation; with Pritchard on the work of the Oxford\r\nUniversity Observatory; with Adams on his Numerical Lunar Theory, &c.,\r\nand with others.--On June 2nd he attended the Visitation of the Royal\r\nObservatory.--He amused himself occasionally with reading his\r\nfavourite subjects of history and antiquities, and with looking over\r\nsome of his early investigations of scientific questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1889\r\n\r\nOn June 5th he made a one-day's excursion to Colchester.--From July\r\n2nd to 27th he was in the Cumberland Lake District, chiefly at\r\nPortinscale near Keswick. While staying at Portinscale he was seized\r\nwith a sudden giddiness and fell upon the floor: he afterwards wrote a\r\ncurious account of the visions which oppressed his brain immediately\r\nafter the accident. He returned by Solihull, where his son Osmund was\r\nresiding.--From Oct. 4th to Nov. 8th he was at Playford. While there\r\nhe drew up a short statement of his general state of health, adverting\r\nparticularly to the loss of strength in his legs and failure of his\r\nwalking powers.--His health seems to have failed a good deal in this\r\nyear: on Feb. 4th he had an accidental fall, and there are several\r\nentries in his Journal of mental attacks, pains in his limbs,\r\naffection of his eye-sight, &c.--In the early part of the year he was\r\nmuch engaged on the history of the Airy family, particularly on that\r\nof his father.--In this year the White House was sold by auction by\r\nits owners, and Airy purchased it on May 24th.--He was still in\r\ndifficulties with his private accounts, but was making efforts to\r\nabandon his old and elaborate system.--For his amusement he was\r\nchiefly engaged on Theological Notes which he was compiling: and also\r\non early optical investigations, &c.\r\n\r\nOn June 1st he attended the Visitation of the Royal Observatory, and\r\nmoved a resolution that a Committee be appointed to consider whether\r\nany reduction can be effected in the amount of matter printed in the\r\nVolume of Observations of the Royal Observatory. During his tenure of\r\noffice he had on various occasions brought this subject before the\r\nBoard of Visitors, and with his usual tenacity of purpose he now as\r\nVisitor pressed it upon their notice.--In May he zealously joined with\r\nothers in an application to get for Dr Huggins a pension on the Civil\r\nList.--In January he prepared a short Paper illustrated with diagrams\r\nto exhibit the Interference of Solar Light, as used by him in his\r\nLectures at Cambridge in 1836: but it does not appear to have been\r\npublished.--In April he received a copy of a Paper by Mr Rundell,\r\nreferring to the complete adoption of his system of compass correction\r\nin iron ships, not only in the merchant service, but also in the\r\nNavy. This was a matter of peculiar gratification to Airy, who had\r\nalways maintained that the method of Tables of Errors, which had been\r\nso persistently adhered to by the Admiralty, was a mistake, and that\r\nsooner or later they would find it necessary to adopt his method of\r\nmechanical correction. The passage referred to is as follows: \"The\r\nname of Sir George Airy, the father of the mechanical compensation of\r\nthe compass in iron vessels, having just been mentioned, it may not be\r\ninappropriate to remind you that the present year is the fiftieth\r\nsince Sir George Airy presented to the Royal Society his celebrated\r\npaper on this subject with the account of his experiments on the\r\n'Rainbow' and 'Ironsides.' Fifty years is a long period in one man's\r\nhistory, and Sir George Airy may well be proud in looking back over\r\nthis period to see how complete has been the success of his compass\r\ninvestigation. His mode of compensation has been adopted by all the\r\ncivilized world. Sir William Thomson, one of the latest and perhaps\r\nthe most successful of modern compass adjusters, when he exhibited his\r\napparatus in 1878 before a distinguished meeting in London, remarked\r\nthat within the last ten years the application of Sir George Airy's\r\nmethod had become universal, not only in the merchant service, but in\r\nthe navies of this and other countries, and added--The compass and the\r\nbinnacles before you are designed to thoroughly carry out in practical\r\nnavigation the Astronomer Royal's principles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1890\r\n\r\nFrom May 17th to 24th he was on an expedition to North Wales, stopping\r\nat Chester, Conway, Carnarvon, Barmouth, and Shrewsbury.--From June\r\n18th to July 24th he was at Playford; and again from Oct. 11th to\r\nNov. 15th.--In this year his powers greatly failed, and he complained\r\nfrequently of mental attacks, weakness of limbs, lassitude, and\r\nfailure of sleep. He occupied himself as usual with his books, papers,\r\nand accounts; and read Travels, Biblical History, &c., but nothing\r\nvery persistently.\r\n\r\nOn June 7th he attended the Visitation of the Royal Observatory.--From\r\na letter addressed to him by Mr J. Hartnup, of Liverpool Observatory,\r\nit appears that there had grown up in the mercantile world an\r\nimpression that very accurate chronometers were not needed for steam\r\nships, because they were rarely running many days out of sight of\r\nland: and Airy's opinion was requested on this matter. He replied as\r\nfollows on Mar. 3rd: \"The question proposed in your letter is purely a\r\npractical one. (1) If a ship is _likely_ ever to be two days out of\r\nsight of land, I think that she ought to be furnished with two _good_\r\nchronometers, properly tested. (2) For the proper testing of the rates\r\nof the chronometers, a rating of the chronometers for three or four\r\ndays in a meridional observatory is necessary. A longer testing is\r\ndesirable.\"--In March he was in correspondence, as one of the Trustees\r\nof the Sheepshanks Fund, with the Master of Trinity relative to grants\r\nfrom the Fund for Cambridge Observatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 1891\r\n\r\nFrom June 16th to July 15th he was at Playford. And again from\r\nOct. 12th to Dec. 2nd (his last visit). Throughout the year his\r\nweakness, both of brain power and muscular power, had been gradually\r\nincreasing, and during this stay at Playford, on Nov. 11th, he fell\r\ndown in his bed-room (probably from failure of nerve action) and was\r\nmuch prostrated by the shock. For several days he remained in a\r\nsemi-unconscious condition, and although he rallied, yet he continued\r\nvery weak, and it was not until Dec. 2nd that he could be removed to\r\nthe White House. Up to the time of his fall he had been able to take\r\nfrequent drives and even short walks in the neighbourhood that he was\r\nso fond of, but he could take but little exercise afterwards, and on\r\nor about Nov. 18th he made the following note: \"The saddest expedition\r\nthat I have ever made. We have not left home for several days.\"\r\n\r\nThe rapid failure of his powers during this year is well exemplified\r\nby his handwriting in his Journal entries, which, with occasional\r\nrallies, becomes broken and in places almost illegible. He makes\r\nfrequent reference to his decline in strength and brain-power, and to\r\nhis failing memory, but he continued his ordinary occupations, made\r\nfrequent drives around Blackheath, and amused himself with his family\r\nhistory researches, arrangement of papers, and miscellaneous reading:\r\nand he persisted to the last with his private accounts. His interest\r\nin matters around him was still keen. On June 13th he was driving\r\nalong the Greenwich Marshes in order to track the course of the great\r\nsewer; and on August 5th he visited the Crossness Sewage Works and\r\ntook great interest in the details of the treatment of the sewage.--In\r\nMarch he contributed, with great satisfaction, to the Fund for the\r\nPortrait of his old friend Sir G.G. Stokes, with whom he had had so\r\nmuch scientific correspondence.--On July 25th an afternoon party was\r\narranged to celebrate the 90th anniversary of his birthday (the actual\r\nanniversary was on July 27th). None of his early friends were there:\r\nhe had survived them all. But invitations were sent to all his\r\nscientific and private friends who could be expected to come, and a\r\nlarge party assembled. The afternoon was very fine, and he sat in the\r\ngarden and received his friends (many of whom had come from long\r\ndistances) in good strength and spirits. It was a most successful\r\ngathering and was not without its meaning; for it was felt that, under\r\nthe circumstances of his failing powers, it was in all probability a\r\nfinal leave-taking.--On July 27th he went down to the Greenwich Parish\r\nChurch at 9 p.m., to be present at the illumination of the church\r\nclock face for the first time--a matter of local interest which had\r\nnecessitated a good deal of time and money. On this occasion at the\r\nrequest of the company assembled in and around the Vestry he spoke for\r\nabout a quarter of an hour on Time--the value of accurate time, the\r\ndissemination of Greenwich time throughout the country by time-signals\r\nfrom the Observatory, and the exhibition of it by time-balls, &c.,\r\n&c.,--the subject to which so large a part of his life had been\r\ndevoted. It was a pleasant and able speech and gave great satisfaction\r\nto the parishioners, amongst whom he had lived for so many years.--He\r\nreceived two illuminated addresses--one from the Astronomer Royal and\r\nStaff of the Royal Observatory; the other from the Vorstand of the\r\nAstronomische Gesellschaft at Berlin--and various private letters of\r\ncongratulation. The address from the Staff of the Observatory was\r\nworded thus: \"We, the present members of the Staff of the Royal\r\nObservatory, Greenwich, beg to offer you our most sincere\r\ncongratulations on the occasion of your 90th birthday. We cannot but\r\nfeel how closely associated we are with you, in that our whole\r\nenergies are directed to the maintenance and development of that\r\npractical astronomical work, of which you essentially laid the\r\nfoundation. It affords us great pleasure to think that after the\r\nconclusion of your life's work, you have been spared to live so long\r\nunder the shadow of the noble Observatory with which your name was\r\nidentified for half a century, and with which it must ever remain\r\nassociated.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his return from Playford he seemed to rally a little: but he\r\nsoon fell ill and was found to be suffering from hernia. This\r\nnecessitated a surgical operation, which was successfully performed on\r\nDec. 17th. This gave him effectual relief, and after recovering from\r\nthe immediate effects of the operation, he lay for several days\r\nquietly and without active pain reciting the English poetry with which\r\nhis memory was stored. But the shock was too great for his enfeebled\r\ncondition, and he died peacefully in the presence of his six surviving\r\nchildren on Jan. 2nd, 1892. He was buried in Playford churchyard on\r\nJan. 7th. The funeral procession was attended at Greenwich by the\r\nwhole staff of the Royal Observatory, and by other friends, and at his\r\nburial there were present two former Fellows of the College to which\r\nhe had been so deeply attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n                 LIST OF PRINTED PAPERS BY G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n                 LIST OF BOOKS WRITTEN BY G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PRINTED PAPERS BY G.B. AIRY.\r\n\r\nWith the instinct of order which formed one of his chief\r\ncharacteristics Airy carefully preserved a copy of every printed Paper\r\nof his own composition. These were regularly bound in large quarto\r\nvolumes, and they are in themselves a striking proof of his wonderful\r\ndiligence. The bound volumes are 14 in number, and they occupy a space\r\nof 2 ft. 6 in. on a shelf. They contain 518 Papers, a list of which is\r\nappended, and they form such an important part of his life's work,\r\nthat his biography would be very incomplete without a reference to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe was very careful in selecting the channels for the publication of\r\nhis Papers. Most of the early Papers were published in the\r\nTransactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, but several of\r\nthe most important, such as his Paper \"On an inequality of long period\r\nin the motions of the Earth and Venus,\" were published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, and others, such as\r\nthe articles on \"The Figure of the Earth,\" \"Gravitation,\" \"Tides and\r\nWaves,\" &c., were published in Encyclopaedias. After his removal to\r\nGreenwich nearly all his Papers on scientific subjects (except\r\nastronomy), such as Tides, Magnetism, Correction of the Compass, &c.,\r\n&c., were communicated to the Royal Society, and were published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions. But everything astronomical was reserved\r\nfor the Royal Astronomical Society. His connection with that Society\r\nwas very close: he had joined it in its earliest days (the date of his\r\nelection was May 9th, 1828), and regarded it as the proper medium for\r\nthe discussion of current astronomical questions, and for recording\r\nastronomical progress. He was unremitting in his attendance at the\r\nMonthly Meetings of the Society, and was several times President. In\r\nthe Memoirs of the Society 35 of his Papers are printed, and in\r\naddition 129 Papers in the Monthly Notices. In fact a meeting of the\r\nSociety rarely passed without some communication from him, and such\r\nwas his wealth of matter that sometimes he would communicate as many\r\nas 3 Papers on a single evening. For the publication of several short\r\nmathematical Papers, and especially for correspondence on disputed\r\npoints of mathematical investigation, he chose as his vehicle the\r\nPhilosophical Magazine, to which he contributed 32 Papers.\r\nInvestigations of a more popular character he published in the\r\nAthenaeum, which he also used as a vehicle for his replies to attacks\r\non his work, or on the Establishment which he conducted: in all he\r\nmade 55 communications to that Newspaper. To various Societies, such\r\nas the Institution of Civil Engineers, the British Association, the\r\nRoyal Institution, &c., he presented Papers or made communications on\r\nsubjects specially suited to each; and in like manner to various\r\nNewspapers: there were 58 Papers in this category. In so long an\r\nofficial life there would naturally be a great number of Official\r\nReports, Parliamentary Returns, &c., and these, with other\r\nmiscellaneous Papers printed for particular objects and for a limited\r\ncirculation, amounted in all to 141.
