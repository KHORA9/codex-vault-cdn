In order to aid in the recognition of these plants,\r\nthe botanical descriptions have been revised to the extent of adding,\r\nwhere possible, the size and shape of the plant, English name, length\r\nof leaves, color of flowers, etc., in many instances supplying the\r\nentire botanical description where it had been omitted on account of\r\ngeneral familiarity with the plant. Comparing the few analyses that I\r\nhave had an opportunity to make with corresponding ones in the native\r\nworks from which Dr. Tavera has taken his botanical descriptions,\r\nI am impressed with the necessity for a revision of the Botany of the\r\nPhilippines. However, as the therapeutic properties of the flora are\r\nof foremost interest to the medical profession I have not hesitated\r\nto publish the book in its present form as an entering wedge, leaving\r\nto those better fitted the great work of classifying the flora of\r\nthese islands in accordance with modern botanical science.\r\n\r\nDr. Tavera has faithfully described the Malay and Hindu therapeutics\r\nof the present day, enriching his description by observations founded\r\non a long practice in Paris and in his own native Luzon. From this\r\npotpourri of scientific therapeutics and ignorant, superstitious\r\ndrugging the interested physician will elicit not a few useful data\r\nconcerning the treatment of disease in the tropics, and at the same\r\ntime gain a more intimate knowledge of both the people and plants of\r\nour new Asiatic possessions.\r\n\r\nI take this occasion to gratefully acknowledge my obligations to\r\nMr. A. P. Tonielli, stenographer and translator of the Supreme Court\r\nof the Philippines, for typewriting the manuscript of this translation.\r\n\r\n\r\nJerome B. Thomas, Jr.\r\n\r\nManila, P. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommissioned by His Majesty's Government to study the medicinal\r\nplants of my native country, I returned there and spent two years in\r\ncollecting data regarding the use that the Filipinos make of their\r\nplants in the treatment of disease. At the same time I collected and\r\ncarefully preserved some with the purpose of taking them to Europe, to\r\nstudy their chemical composition in the laboratories of Paris under the\r\ndirection of the eminent men who had been my instructors in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe work I did in the Philippines was preliminary, a preparation\r\nfor the more extended study of the subject which I wished to make\r\nin Paris, where I went with my notes and collection. Unfortunately,\r\nupon leaving Manila, I confided the mounting and pressing of my\r\nplants to an inexperienced person who stupidly placed in the midst\r\nof them several succulent tubers which decomposed during the voyage\r\nand spoiled the other plants. At the same time I received in Paris\r\nan important collection of the vegetable drugs of the Philippines,\r\nsent by my friend the pharmacist, M. Rosedo Garcia, and destined for\r\nthe World's Fair of 1889. I opened with great pleasure the wood and\r\nzinc box in which the collection came, anticipating that I should be\r\nable to carry out my plan of study and at the same time win for my\r\nfriend, Garcia, a well-deserved premium. Imagine my disappointment\r\nupon finding that, by an unfortunate coincidence, his plants had\r\narrived in the same condition as mine, having also been packed with\r\ntubers of ubi, gabi, etc., and several cocoanuts which had decomposed.\r\n\r\nMany times since then I have tried to obtain from Manila, through\r\nexchange or payment of money, a similar collection, but have been\r\nunable to secure a single leaf of the plants I so desired. If in the\r\nfuture I have the good fortune to procure any, I shall make a study\r\nof those at hand and publish the results.\r\n\r\nI herewith publish the results of my investigations and experiments\r\nin Manila, where, especially in the neighboring towns of San Mateo\r\nand San Miguel, I often had opportunities for using, with good\r\nresults, the plants of which this volume treats. I may add that in\r\nspite of the limited means at my disposal in Manila and the short\r\ntime left me by my regular occupations I was able to conduct a few\r\nlaboratory experiments owing to which this work contains some personal\r\nobservations reinforcing those quoted from medical literature.\r\n\r\nThe flora of the Archipelago is known to-day through the works of\r\nFathers Blanco, Llanos, Fernandez del Villar and Naves, and of the\r\nengineers Jordano, the brothers Vidal and Soler and others who have\r\nbrought such honor to Spanish science, preparing the way for the study\r\nof the therapeutic and industrial applications of that wonderfully rich\r\nplant life with which our islands have been endowed. Their works help\r\nus to recognize the plants whose medicinal virtues are herein described\r\nand it is to them I owe the botanical descriptions in this treatise.\r\n\r\nFather Blanco, in describing certain plants, mentions their medicinal\r\nuses in the Philippines, but his descriptions are few and very\r\ndeficient as one would expect in a work of the scope of his Flora. A\r\nJesuit of some reputation, Father Clain, published in Manila in 1712\r\na book entitled \"Remedios fáciles para diferentes enfermedades?\" in\r\nwhich he speaks of the medicinal virtues of some of the indigenous\r\nplants, almost the same ones that appear in another work, a frank\r\nand pleasing little treatise written by Father Santa Maria. Father\r\nMercado is the only one who has written a special treatise on the\r\nsubject and his manuscript remained unedited until the Augustinian\r\nFathers of Manila published it in the last edition of Father Blanco's\r\n\"Flora\"; but neither this work nor those of Clain or Santa Maria are\r\nuseful to a physician, nor are they as accurately written as works\r\nof a scientific character should be. From time to time superficial\r\narticles have appeared in the Manila papers regarding the virtues of\r\nsome plant or other and these books and articles comprise the whole\r\nliterature on the subject up to this time.\r\n\r\nSome physicians regard with small favor the therapeutic application of\r\nplants by the Filipino \"herb-doctors\" (curanderos) as being entirely\r\nempirical. This disparagement is unjustified because in all the\r\nmost rational and scientific remedies that we make use of, the first\r\nstep towards the final development of their relative position among\r\nremedies is due to empiricism which is founded on daily experience,\r\non observation of results obtained in specific cases, facts that\r\nare handed down from father to son for generations. The scientific\r\nexplanation is lacking, but those first ideas frequently owing their\r\norigin to chance, or, perhaps, to superstition, have often been based\r\nupon the observation of facts which, although fortuitous, are none\r\nthe less positive.\r\n\r\nMany of the plants mentioned in this book are official in the\r\nPharmacopoeia of India and we see no reason why their use should be\r\nproscribed in the Philippines. Filipino physicians not only can but\r\nshould employ many indigenous plants in their therapeutics; in many\r\ninstances they would find them more useful than the exotics, which\r\nare not always fresh and are commonly reduced in strength by long\r\nkeeping or damaged by some circumstance of voyage or climate. The\r\nprice is another argument in favor of the use of native drugs. If\r\nthe pharmacists would prepare extracts and keep on hand the crude\r\ndrugs most in demand the public would gain a great advantage and the\r\ndruggists be well repaid for their labor. Physicians and pharmacists\r\nwill surely understand these advantages and when finally one considers\r\nthat the patients generally prefer to be treated with native plants,\r\nI feel justified in the hope that their use will spread rapidly in\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\nTo employ therapeutically the drugs described in this work is not\r\nto experiment \"in anima vilis,\" as some would have us believe. To\r\nexperiment is to employ unknown remedies of unknown virtues and\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nIn this treatise I am not attempting to fix the indications for this\r\nor that product, but simply make known the diseases in which the\r\nFilipinos and the natives of other countries employ the products. Any\r\nphysician has a perfect right to prescribe these drugs, as have also\r\nthe \"curanderos\" and even the laity, with this difference, however,\r\nthat the physician is capable of observing results and guiding\r\nhimself by the physiologic action of the drugs. His knowledge of\r\nthe physiologic and anatomo-pathologic problems of the human body,\r\nwill enable the physician to make scientific inferences that would\r\nbe hidden from the common \"curandero.\"\r\n\r\nAs neither the Manila nor the provincial physicians keep these\r\nmedicinal plants in stock, with the exception of those that are\r\nofficial in the European and American pharmacopoeias, it will be\r\nnecessary for the physician who wishes to use them, to busy himself\r\nwith seeking them and laying in a sufficient stock to serve him when\r\nthe opportunity presents itself. It is necessary to preserve them by\r\ndrying and this is best done by exposing them several days to the fresh\r\nair in a dry place--for example, the corridors of the house--being\r\ncareful not to expose them to the rays of the sun, in which latter\r\nevent the fleshy and juicy plants which do not desiccate rapidly,\r\nputrefy or ferment.\r\n\r\nA convenient way to get them is to visit the Binondo Square where there\r\nhas been market for native drugs from time immemorial. The gardeners\r\nfrom the neighboring towns, especially those from Pasay and Singalon,\r\nregularly offer the plants for sale and will undertake to supply you\r\nwith any that may not be on hand. Inasmuch as the common names of the\r\nplants lead to many mistakes and much confusion, it is indispensable to\r\nacquaint one's self with the description of the plant and be sure that\r\nthe actual product conforms in all respects to the description. For\r\nthis purpose it is well to obtain flowering specimens, and bearing\r\nthis fact in mind I have been careful to indicate the flowering\r\nseason of each plant. By making excursions to the towns of San Mateo\r\nand Angono I have obtained an abundance of whatever I sought and\r\nat the same time have learned by talking with the mountaineers and\r\n\"curanderos,\" what uses they make of their plants. The \"curanderos\"\r\nknow a great deal concerning these uses, but become very reticent\r\nas soon as they are questioned about them. Whether it is dread of\r\nridicule or selfishness or fear that silences them, the fact remains\r\nthat it is no easy matter to glean any useful facts from them. And\r\nyet by tact and friendliness one may elicit much more information\r\nfrom them than first impressions would lead one to hope.\r\n\r\nLeaves should be gathered when fully developed, rejecting the old,\r\ndried and worm-eaten ones.\r\n\r\nThe best time to gather bark is one month before the period of\r\ninflorescence, when it is rich in sap. The flowers are best gathered\r\nwhen about half expanded. The fruit is gathered green or ripe according\r\nto the active principle sought. The seeds should always be mature.\r\n\r\nNot all parts of the plant are equally provided with the active\r\nprinciple which may be localized in the root or the flower; or distinct\r\nprinciples may exist in different parts of the same plant. Therefore\r\nthe part indicated, and only that part, should be employed.\r\n\r\nIn the root the active substance usually resides in the bark, sometimes\r\nin the parenchyma that envelopes the woody tissue and rarely in the\r\nwoody tissue itself, as, for example, in \"rhubarb\" and \"pareira brava.\"\r\n\r\nThe stem bark is also a frequent seat of the active principle, of\r\nwhich the outer portion contains the greater amount, according to\r\nthe valuable experiments of Howard.\r\n\r\nSome plants owe their therapeutic importance to their wood, others to\r\ntheir leaves or flowers, and regarding the localization of the active\r\nprinciple in these parts we have nothing especial to indicate. The\r\nfruit, however, may have a pericarp consisting of mucilage, starch,\r\nsugar and gum, etc., while the seeds contain fatty matter, fixed or\r\nessential oils or alkaloids, as is the case with coffee and cacao. In\r\nview of these facts, we repeat that it is indispensable to use that\r\npart of each plant which I have indicated as applicable to a determined\r\ncase or condition.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hope that the physicians and pharmacists practising in\r\nthe Philippines may undertake investigations and experiments regarding\r\nthe therapeutic properties of the plants of my native land, and that\r\nmy endeavors may have acted as a stimulus or inspiration to the loyal\r\nand earnest study of the subjects that are now awakening such interest,\r\nnot only in Europe and America, but in India and Japan.\r\n\r\nI should be pleased to receive notes, plants or reports of researches\r\nfrom any one interested in the subject matter of this book, and I\r\nshall consider it a pleasure, as well as a duty, to devote my forces,\r\nsmall as they may be, to aiding any one who may do me the honor to\r\nclaim my assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

I should\r\nbe inconsistent as to my own theories and convictions if I continued\r\nto follow the old form of spelling. For the benefit of those who are\r\nnot familiar with the matter I will state that the consonants are\r\npronounced as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n            g always as in get.\r\n            h gutturalized aspirate.\r\n            k as in English.\r\n            w always as initial w in English, win, wan.\r\n            ng as ng in sing, hung, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABBREVIATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Bic.--Bicol.\r\n            Eng.--English.\r\n            Iloc.--Ilocan.\r\n            Indo-Eng.--Indo-English.\r\n            Pam.--Pampango.\r\n            Pan.--Pangasinan.\r\n            Sp.--Spanish.\r\n            Sp.-Fil.--Spanish-Filipino.\r\n            Tag.--Tagalog.\r\n            Vis.--Viscayan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE PHILIPPINES\r\n\r\n\r\nDICOTYLEDONOUS, POLYPETALOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDILLENIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tetracera macrophylla, Vall._ (_T. monocarpa_, _T. sarmentosa_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Malakatmón_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The wood of _malakatmón_ is one of the best known and popular\r\ndrugs of the Binondo [1] market place. It is used as an infusion\r\ninternally in the hæmoptysis of consumptives, and externally in the\r\ntreatment of sore throat, its action being due to the large amount\r\nof tannin it contains. It is also employed in Malabar in the form of\r\nan infusion of the leaves of the species, _T. Rheedi_, to treat sore\r\nthroat, mixing it with a decoction of rice called _cange_.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos do not distinguish this species from the _T. Assa_.\r\n\r\nBoth are called _malakatmón_, and are employed indiscriminately to\r\naccomplish the same results. The silicious concretion obtained from\r\nthe leaves is used as a polish in the form of polish paper.\r\n\r\nDose.--In infusion for internal use, 4 grams of wood to 1 liter of\r\nwater; as a gargle, 10 to 15 grams to the liter.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub with leaves alternate, oval, serrate,\r\nfinely dentate with very short and stiff hairs. Flowers of a strong,\r\nrather agreeable odor, axillary, in panicles. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla,\r\n4 petals. Stamens indefinite, expanding at the upper end and bearing\r\n2 anthers. Carpels 3, with ovules indefinite in two series. Seeds\r\nwith red arils.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In the vicinity of Manila. Blooms in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNOLIACEÆ\r\n\r\nMagnolia Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Illicium anisatum, L._\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Anis estrellado_, _Badiana_, Sp.; _Sangki_, Tag.; _Star\r\nAnise_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--Although this plant does not grow in the Philippines, the\r\nuse of its fruit is so common there that it demands a place in this\r\nwork. It is employed chiefly as a condiment in the preparation of food,\r\nand its essential oil is used to prepare the native \"anise cordial\"\r\nby mixing it with alcohol obtained from the palm or from sugar cane.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of the fruit is given after meals as a tea-like beverage,\r\nto aid digestion or for its carminative effect in flatulent colic.\r\n\r\nStar anise has an aromatic taste, slightly bitter and acrid, and\r\na very marked perfume of anise which with its star-like form gives\r\nthe plant one of its names. It is a very useful stimulant, tonic,\r\nstomachic and carminative.\r\n\r\nIt is official in all Pharmacopoeias and the pericarp is the part\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe dose is from 1 to 2 grams to 100 of water in infusion, to be\r\ntaken in one draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schlegel it contains the following substances: An\r\nessential oil 4.675; a green waxy material which melts at 51°, a resin,\r\na gum and saponin. The essential oil is (almost) identical with that\r\nof anise from which it is impossible to distinguish it chemically. The\r\nonly difference is that the former has a blander odor and solidifies\r\nat 1°.25 instead of 10°, as does the oil of anise.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The plant grows in the mountains of Yunnan,\r\nChina, and in Tonquin. The part used in the Philippines is the fruit,\r\nbeing indeed the only part known here. This is composed of 8 woody\r\nfollicles arranged about a central column in the form of a star. These\r\nfollicles open at maturity and reveal the seeds, which are shining,\r\nsmooth, ovoid, hard, of a pretty chestnut-red color. In the Philippines\r\nthey are sold even in the smallest food-vending shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Michelia Champaca, L._\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tsampaka_, _Sampaka_, Tag.; _Champaca_, Fil.-Span.\r\n\r\nUses.--The bark of the trunk is well known as a febrifuge\r\nand emmenagogue in India. It is slightly bitter and\r\naromatic. Dr. H. Folliat has used it with success in the Island\r\nof Mauritius in the treatment of the common intermittent fevers;\r\nhe administered the infusion (bark 30 grams, water 600 cc.)--or the\r\ndecoction (bark 30 grams, water 1,200 cc.); boil till reduced to\r\n600 cc.--giving a wine-glassful every hour just before and after\r\nthe paroxysm.\r\n\r\nAn astringent decoction made from the leaves is used as a gargle in\r\nsore throat. The root is emmenagogue and the seeds are used in the\r\ntreatment of anal fissure.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooper has found the following substances in the bark of the\r\n_Champana_: a volatile oil with a pine-like odor; a fixed oil,\r\ninsoluble in alcohol, melting at 15° and forming soap with soda;\r\na resin extremely bitter, acrid, brown in color; tannin; sugar;\r\na bitter principle, albuminoids, coloring matters, mucilage and starch.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 15-18° high; leaves alternate, 6 × 2',\r\nstipulate, simple. Flowers fragrant, saffron-colored, hermaphrodite,\r\nsolitary and axillary. The receptacle, conical at its base, becomes\r\nnarrow, lengthens and then enlarges, forming a column which is bare\r\nat its narrow part. At its base is inserted the perianth composed of\r\n6 overlapping leaflets arranged in two series. Stamens indefinite,\r\nfixed in the base of the column of the receptacle on the superior\r\nportion of which are inserted the ovaries which contain many ovules\r\narranged in two vertical series.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts (of the islands).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANONACEÆ.\r\n\r\nCustard-Apple Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artabotrys odoratissimus_, R. Br. (_A. hamatus_, Bl.; _Uvaria\r\nSinensis_ and _Unona uncinata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Ilang-ilang de China_, Sp.-Fil.; _Alang-ilang Son-son_,\r\nTag.\r\n\r\nUses.--A decoction of the leaves of this species is used to treat\r\ncholera in some of the islands of the Malay group; in the island of\r\nJava they use for the same purpose a decoction of the leaves of the\r\nspecies _A. suaveolens_, Bl., which is commonly called _Susong Damulog_\r\nin the Pampanga dialect. The active principles of these plants are so\r\npowerful that one must beware of giving a large dose, as hemorrhages,\r\nnervous phenomena and abortion may follow.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 15-18° high with leaves alternate,\r\nlanceolate, glabrous, and petioles very short. Flowers very sweet,\r\naxillary, solitary. Petals 6, fleshy, concave at the base. Stamens\r\nindefinite, closely packed, overlapping. Peduncle curved like a crook.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Cultivated in gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anona squamosa_, L. (_A. tuberosa_, Rumph.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Ates_, Tag.; _Custard Apple_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit of the mature ates is edible and is one of the most\r\ndelicious that grows in the Philippines; its white and delicately\r\nperfumed pulp has a delicious flavor. The unripe fruit is exceedingly\r\nastringent. The fermented juice of the ripe pulp is used in certain\r\nparts of America to prepare a popular drink. The powdered seeds make\r\na useful parasiticide especially when used on the scalp, but it is\r\nnecessary to avoid getting any of the drug in the eyes on account of\r\nits irritant effect.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Tree 8 or 9° high with leaves alternate,\r\noblong, the edges pubescent. Flowers greenish-yellow, axillary,\r\nsolitary; peduncle not curved. Petals 6, convergent. Stamens crowded,\r\nindefinite. Fruit fleshy, covered with scales or rather rounded\r\ntubercles; beneath is the white and fragment pulp, covering the\r\nlong-oval seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. reticulate, L._\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Anonas_, Sp.-Fil.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit of this species is neither as much prized nor as\r\nabundant in the Philippines as that of the ates. When unripe it\r\npossesses the same properties as the latter. The large proportion of\r\ntannin which both species contain in their unripe state, makes them\r\nvery useful in treating diarrhoea and dysentery. They are administered\r\nin the form of a decoction, by enema. The sap of the trunk is very\r\nirritating. The roots are used by the American Indians to treat\r\nepilepsy. Lemon juice is the antidote for the sap of this species.\r\n\r\nI wish to call attention to the similarity of the common name of this\r\nplant to another entirely distinct species commonly used in the Tagalo\r\ntherapeutics; namely, the _anonang_ (Cordia), with which it must not\r\nbe confused.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Tree 10° high with leaves lanceolate,\r\npubescent. Flowers in a sort of umbel. Corolla like that of\r\n_A. squamosa_. Fruit without the plainly visible tubercles of the\r\nforegoing species, their presence being merely suggested by a sort\r\nof net traced on the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. muricata_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Guanábano_, _Goyabano_, Sp.-Fil.\r\n\r\nUses.--The ripe fruit possesses antiscorbutic properties; the unripe\r\nfruit is used in treating dysentery. It is said that the ripe fruit\r\nis used in diseases of the liver.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Tree with leaves oval, alternate and\r\nglabrous. Flower solitary, terminal, whitish. The fruit is much larger\r\nthan that of the other species, is covered with scales that end in\r\na soft point or thorn and has a very pronounced acid taste.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--All three species are common in all parts of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMENISPERMACEÆ.\r\n\r\nMoonseed Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tinospora crispa_, Miers. (_Menispermum crispum_, L.; _M. rimosum_,\r\nBlanco; _Cocculus crispus_, DC.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Makabuhay_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--Makabuhay is one of the most widely known and used plants in the\r\nPhilippines; a sort of panacea applied to all bodily afflictions. Its\r\nTagalo name means literally \"you may live.\" A shoot deprived of roots\r\nand dropped in some moist place is soon covered with bright green\r\nleaves and adventitious roots. This peculiarity of the plant made\r\nit possible for me to take a large number of sprouts from Manila to\r\nParis where they arrived perfectly fresh after a voyage of forty days,\r\nduring which they lay almost forgotten in the ship and the cars.\r\n\r\nThe stem is the part employed in medicine. A decoction is\r\ngiven internally in the various forms of malarial fever and of\r\ndyspepsia. Externally it is most useful as a wash for ulcers of all\r\nkinds, rapidly improving their appearance.\r\n\r\nIn India the species _T. cordifolia_ is used; it differs but little\r\nfrom _T. crispa_. It is official in the Pharmacopoeia and has been\r\nintroduced into Europe. _T. cordifolia_ has given excellent results in\r\nthe mild forms of intermittent fever; in general debility following\r\nlong and severe cases of illness; in chronic rheumatism, and in the\r\nsecond stage of syphilis. As the two species are so much alike we\r\nshall add the preparations and dose of _T. cordifolia_ which we have\r\nused on several occasions with good results.\r\n\r\nTincture of T. cordifolia.--Stems of the dried plant, 100\r\ngrams. Alcohol 21° (Cartier), 500 cc. Macerate seven days in a closed\r\nvessel stirring from time to time. After decanting add enough alcohol\r\n(21°) to bring the quantity up to 500 cc., and filter.\r\n\r\nDose.--4-8 grams.\r\n\r\nMaceration.--Fresh stems cut in small pieces, 30 grams, water 300\r\ngrams. Macerate for two hours and filter.\r\n\r\nDose.--30-90 cc. a day.\r\n\r\nExtract.--Dry makabuhay in small pieces 500 grams. Water 2 1/2\r\nliters. Macerate for twelve hours, filter the liquid and express the\r\nmacerated drug which is then macerated a second time in 2 1/2 liters\r\nof water. Express again, unite the two liquids and filter. Evaporate\r\nin a water-bath to the consistency of a pill mass.\r\n\r\nDose.--1/2-1 1/2 grams a day in fractional doses.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A vine whose runners entwine themselves among\r\nthe tops of the highest trees, giving off many adventitious roots which\r\nseek the earth. The stem is covered with projecting tubercles. Leaves\r\nheart-shaped, pointed, entire with five well-marked nerves. Flowers\r\nyellowish-green, dioecious, growing in axillary racemes. The male\r\nflowers have a corolla of six petals, the three smaller ones arranged\r\nalternately. In the female flower the stamens are represented by three\r\nglands situated at the base of the petals. Fruit, an elliptical drupe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anamirta Cocculus_, Wight & Arn. (_Menispermum Cocculus_, (L.) Blanco;\r\n_M. lacunosum_, Famk; _Cocculus lacunosus_, _C. suberosus_, DC.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Laktang_, _Liktang_, _Suma_, _Lanta_, _Lintang bagin_,\r\n_Tuba_, _Balasin_, _Bayati_, Tag., Vis., Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--One of the uses to which the India berries (_Cocas de Levante_)\r\nare put in the Philippines, is to throw them into small sluggish\r\nstreams or into lakes with the object of intoxicating the fish which\r\nsoon come to the surface and float there as if dead. This custom\r\nis very extensive in Malaysia, in India and even in Europe, where,\r\nin order to avoid the cases of poisoning which this practice has\r\noccasioned in the consumers of fish taken in this way, it has been\r\nfound necessary to forbid the sale of the berries except in the\r\npharmacies. These restrictions are practiced in France.\r\n\r\nIn the Binondo market in Manila the root of this plant may be found in\r\nabundance; it is yellow and very bitter. The natives use the infusion\r\n(5-10 grams to 300 cc. of water) in fevers, dyspepsia and menstrual\r\nderangements. In India also the root is used in the same complaints.\r\n\r\nThe fruit contains the highly toxic principle _picrotoxin_, and others\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n_Menispermin_ (C_18_H_24_N_2_O_2_) is an alkaloid which crystallizes\r\nin pyramidal prisms, is soluble in alcohol and ether and insoluble\r\nin water. Hot nitric acid converts it into oxalic acid and a yellow\r\nsubstance of a resinous appearance.\r\n\r\n_Picrotoxin_ (C_30_H_24_O_13_) is not an alkaloid as may be seen from\r\nits formula. Its properties are not well known at the present time. It\r\ncrystallizes in small quadrilateral prisms, white and transparent,\r\nor in needles grouped in stars. No odor, taste bitter, insoluble\r\nin water, partly soluble in alcohol and in ether, freely soluble in\r\nacids and alkalies. A solution in concentrated sulphuric acid has a\r\nsaffron-yellow color. Nitric acid transforms it into oxalic acid.\r\n\r\n_Picrotoxinin_ exists in picrotoxin in the proportion of 32 to 100,\r\nand may be separated by boiling in benzine. It is bitter, poisonous,\r\nreduced by Fehling's solution and nitrate of silver. Sixty-six\r\nper cent. of _picrotoxin_ consists of another bitter substance,\r\nnon-poisonous--_picrotin_, which is insoluble in benzine and is reduced\r\nby Fehling's solution and nitrate of silver. Lastly, _anamirtin_\r\nis found in the mother water of picrotoxin; it is not bitter, not\r\npoisonous, and not reducible by the aforementioned reagents.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the _anamirta_, the \"coca de Levante\" is an acrid,\r\nnarcotic poison, which may not be employed internally; its uses are\r\nlimited to external medication. In the Pharmacopoeia of India is\r\ngiven the formula for a parasiticide ointment, highly recommended in\r\nthe treatment of pediculi:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unguentum anamirtæ_:\r\n\r\n               4 grams Cocculus berries, powdered,\r\n              30 grams Vaseline.\r\n            M.  Fiat unguentum.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn applying this ointment it is necessary to make sure that there\r\nis no wound or abrasion of the skin through which absorption might\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A vine with leaves alternate, entire, glabrous,\r\nbroadly oval, pointed, with 5 nerves which unite at the base, long\r\npetioles. Flowers dioecious, in compound racemes. Male flowers consist\r\nof a perianth without corolla, the sepals arranged by threes in two or\r\nthree whorls. The end of the receptacle expanded like a bead, bears\r\na large number of stamens in 6 vertical series, with anthers sessile\r\nand 4-lobed. Female flowers analogous as regards the perianth, with\r\n6-9 sterile stamens. Carpels formed of 5 ovaries, free, unilocular,\r\ncontaining one ovule each. Fruit, a drupe of a purple color, the size\r\nof a filbert, kidney-shaped, the albumen horny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cissampelos Pareira_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sansawsansawan_, Tag.; _Chinchaochinchauan_, Sp.-Fil.\r\n\r\nUses.--Although this plant formerly bore the Portuguese name of\r\n_Pareira brava_, the U. S. P. and B. P. recognize now under this\r\ntitle only the root of _Chondrodendron tomentosum_. It is diuretic\r\nand tonic and apparently exercises an astringent and sedative action\r\nupon the mucous membrane of the genito-urinary organs. The root is\r\nused in acute and chronic cystitis.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil it is used as a diaphoretic and as such is employed in cases\r\nof venomous snake bites. It is also used there as an emmenagogue and\r\ndiuretic, in intermittent fevers, dropsy and suppression of the lochia\r\nin women recently confined.\r\n\r\nIt is official in the Pharmacopoeia of India.\r\n\r\nDecoction.--Root of cissampelos, small pieces,   50 grams.\r\n            Water                               600 grams.\r\n\r\nDose.--30-100 grams.\r\n\r\nBoil 15 minutes; filter and add enough water to bring the total bulk\r\nup to 600 cc.\r\n\r\nExtract.--Root of cissampelos in powder     500 grams.\r\n          Water                               5 liters.\r\n\r\nDose.--.5-1 gram.\r\n\r\nDigest the powder for 24 hours in 500 cc. water, pour the mixture\r\ninto a filter and add water gradually until the percolate amounts to\r\n5 liters. Evaporate the percolate in a water-bath to the consistency\r\nof a pill mass.\r\n\r\nFluid Extract.--This is prepared in the same manner as the extract\r\nand is allowed to remain in the bath until reduced in bulk to 400\r\ngrams. It is then removed and 100 grams of alcohol (36°) are added.\r\n\r\nDose.--1.75-7 cc.\r\n\r\nChemical Composition.--Flückiger has isolated a bitter principle\r\nanalogous to berberin; also _buxine_ and _paracine_, which latter\r\nreceived the name _pelosine_ from Wiggers in 1839. The former chemist\r\nproposed the name buxine for all these analogous principles. Pelosine\r\nor buxine is precipitated by a concentrated solution of HCl, by\r\nsal ammoniac, by potassium nitrate and potassium iodide. He also\r\ndiscovered a neutral substance, _deyamitin_, which crystallizes in\r\nmicroscopic tablets; sulphuric acid added to these gives a pretty\r\ndark blue color which changes to green.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A climbing shrub with cylindrical woody\r\nstem, with leaves simple, alternate, entire, petiolate, ovoid,\r\nbroad at the base. The inferior surface of the leaf is pubescent,\r\nespecially in the intervals between the ribs. Flowers dioecious, small,\r\nracemose. Calyx of 12 sepals arranged in 3 whorls, the inner ones\r\nbroad and petaloid. Corolla of 6 petals arranged in 2 whorls. Stamens\r\nsterile or rudimentary in the pistillate flower, the staminate flower\r\nbearing 6; anthers innate, 2-celled. Drupes oval, 2 or 3 cm. long,\r\nblack, closely resembling a grape seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNYMPHÆACEÆ.\r\n\r\nWater-Lily Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nymphæa Lotus_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Lawas_, _Talaylo_, _Tunas_, _Gaway-gaway_, Tag., Vis.,\r\nPam.; _Water Lily_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The anaphrodisiac virtues attributed to this plant and to\r\nall the water-lily family are purely imaginary. Its juice being\r\nslightly bitter and astringent is used in decoction as an injection\r\nin gonorrhoea. It possesses mild narcotic properties, for which some\r\nuse the juice of the whole plant, rubbing the forehead and temples\r\nwith it to produce sleep.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--An aquatic plant, with leaves solitary,\r\nterminal, floating on the water, dentate, glabrous, broad, deeply cleft\r\nat the base, with a very long petiole. Flowers solitary, persistent in\r\nthe ripe fruit, oval. Stamens indefinite in fine whorls or verticils.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common on the shores of the Laguna de Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nelumbium nucifera_, Gaertn. (_N. speciosum_, Willd.; _N. Asiaticum_,\r\nRich.; _Cyamus Nelumbo_, Sm.; _C. mysticus_, Salis.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bayno_, Tag.; _Sukaw_, Iloc.; _Sacred Lotus_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--An infusion of the flowers is used internally in dysentery. In\r\nIndia they use, for diarrhoea and vomiting, the viscid juice obtained\r\nfrom the petioles and the peduncles of the flowers. The rootstock\r\ncontains a large quantity of starch which has been utilized for food\r\nin the periods of famine which have desolated India and Egypt. This\r\nflower was the Sacred Lotus of the Egyptians and the people of India\r\nhave dedicated it to Lakshmi, the goddess of health and prosperity.\r\n\r\nInfusion.--Petals, dried        5 grams.\r\n           Water              250 grams.\r\n\r\nSig. To be taken during 24 hours.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--An aquatic plant with fleshy rootstock which\r\ncreeps along the muddy bottoms; from its nodes spring the stalks of\r\nthe leaves and flowers. Its leaves are alternate, polymorphous, some\r\nabove and some below the surface of the water, concave in the center\r\nwhence ribs separate, shield-shaped. Petioles very long, bearing soft,\r\nshort spines. The flowers white or pink, solitary; peduncle long\r\nand, like the petioles, covered with soft, short spines. Calyx of\r\n4-5 unequal sepals, imbricated. Corolla with an indefinite number of\r\nunequal petals, the inner ones shorter. Stamens indefinite, inserted in\r\nthe base of the receptacle. Receptacle expanded above the androecium,\r\nin the form of an inverted cone, containing a large number of alveoli\r\nwith circular openings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPAVERACEÆ.\r\n\r\nPoppy Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Argemone Mexicana_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kasubhang-aso_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--Padre Blanco says that the yellow juice of this plant \"is\r\nused by the natives (Filipinos) to treat fissures of the corners of\r\nthe eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe negros of Senegal use the decoction of the root to cure\r\ngonorrhoea. The milky juice to which Blanco refers is used in\r\ndifferent countries to treat various skin diseases, including the\r\ncutaneous manifestations of syphilis and leprosy; to remove warts,\r\nand as an eye wash in catarrhal conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nThe English physicians of India state that it is dangerous to use\r\nthe milky juice as an application to the eye, although Dymock claims\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are narcotic by virtue of a principle resembling morphine,\r\nperhaps identical with that alkaloid.\r\n\r\nThe seeds yield a fixed oil on expression, which is laxative and\r\nrelieves the pains of colic, probably by virtue of its narcotic\r\nproperties. Physicians in India praise this oil highly; not only is\r\nit a sure and painless purgative, but it is free from the viscidity\r\nand disgusting taste of castor-oil; besides it has the advantage of\r\noperating in small doses, 2-4 grams. Its activity is proportionate to\r\nits freshness. Dr. W. O'Shaughnessy does not value this oil highly,\r\nbut the experience of many distinguished physicians of India has\r\nproved the purgative and other properties that have just been\r\nmentioned. Possibly the differences of opinion may arise from the\r\nfact that oils from different plants were used in the trials.\r\n\r\nThe seeds yield a fixed oil, yellow, clear, of sweet taste, density\r\n0.919 at 15°; it remains liquid at -5°; is soluble in an equal volume\r\nof alcohol at 90°; characterized by an orange-red color on adding\r\nnitric acid. From its soap Frolicher has obtained acetic, valerianic,\r\nbutyric and benzoic acids. Charbonnier claims to have found morphine\r\nin its leaves and capsules. Dragendorf has isolated from the seeds\r\nan alkaloid which presents the principal characters of morphine. It\r\nis, then, probable that morphine is the narcotic principle possessed\r\nby this plant, which is not hard to believe when one considers the\r\nfamily to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant of American origin nowadays\r\nacclimated in almost all warm countries. Its stem is green,\r\npubescent, 30-40 centimeters high. Leaves alternate, thin, sessile,\r\nlanceolate, covered with rigid green thorns. Flowers hermaphrodite,\r\nterminal, yellow. Calyx, 3 sepals with conical points. Corolla, 6\r\nrounded petals. Stamens indefinite, free, hypogynous. Ovary free,\r\ntriangular. Capsule expanded, oblong, angular, thickly set with\r\nprickles: it opens inferiorly by 5 valves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUCIFERÆ.\r\n\r\nMustard Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brassica juncea_, Hook. & Thom. (_Sinapis juncea_, L.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Mostaza_, Sp.; _Mustard_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The seeds are used in the same way as those of white or black\r\nmustard (_Sinapis alba_ and _S. nigra_, L.).\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Plant with a glabrous stem, leaves sessile,\r\nglabrous, lanceolate, the upper ones serrate, the lower ones almost\r\nentire. Flowers in racemes. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 rounded,\r\nunguiculate petals. Stamens 6, two of them short and the other four\r\nlonger and united in pairs. Ovary flattened. Seed vessel quadrangular,\r\nnodular, glabrous, containing many oval seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Raphanus sativus, L._\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Rábano_, Sp.; _Radish_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--Used principally as food; it possesses the antiscorbutic\r\nproperties common to the greater part of the Cruciferæ.\r\n\r\nIt is an herbaceous plant, the root of which is so commonly known\r\nthat its description would be useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPPARIDACEÆ.\r\n\r\nCaper Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cleome viscosa_, L. (_C. icosandra_, L.; _Polanisia viscosa_, DC.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Balabalanoyan_, _Apoyapoyan_, Tag.; _Wild Mustard_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The seeds possess the same properties as those of mustard and\r\nare used in place of the latter in Manila. In America the leaves are\r\nused as a poultice in otitis, their action being rubefacient. In India\r\nthe seeds are given internally for their anthelmintic and carminative\r\neffect; the dose is one teaspoonful twice a day. The juice of the\r\nleaves mixed with cocoanut oil is used in the form of eardrops in\r\nsuppurative otitis.\r\n\r\nThe natives give the same common name to the _Gynandropsis\r\npentaphylla_, DC. (_Cleome pentaphylla_, L.; _C. altiacea_ or\r\n_C. alliodora_, Blanco), which is distinguished from the former\r\nby its six stamens inserted on the pistil and its violet-colored\r\nstem. Its therapeutic properties are identical with those of\r\nthe _Cleome viscosa_. Dr. Sir W. Jones believes that the plant\r\npossesses antispasmodic properties, basing his belief on its odor,\r\nwhich resembles _asafetida_, though not so disagreeable. In India the\r\njuice of the leaves is a popular remedy for earache. It is also used\r\nthere as a rubefacient.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--An annual, the stem channeled and bearing\r\nglandular hairs. Leaves compound, alternate; leaflets lanceolate with\r\nglandular hairs. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 petals, yellow. Stamens\r\n14-16, encircling the pistil. Seed vessels cylindrical, with channels\r\nand glandular hairs. The whole plant is sticky and emits a garlicky\r\nodor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cratæva religiosa_, Forst.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Salingbobog_, Tag.; _Balay-namuk_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--It is in common use in India as a tonic and stomachic. It\r\nseems also to possess laxative and diuretic properties. In Concan\r\nthe juice of the leaves mixed with cocoanut oil is used as a liniment\r\nin rheumatism.\r\n\r\nInfusion.--Leaves, fresh            50 grams.\r\n           Water                   500 grams.\r\n\r\nDose.--50-100 grams a day as a tonic or stomachic.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub 15-20° high with compound trifoliate\r\nleaves with long petioles; leaflets lanceolate, acuminate, smooth,\r\ndark green. Calyx of 4 imbricated sepals. Corolla of 4 unguiculate\r\npetals, between white and straw color, 1' long. Stamens indefinite,\r\nviolet-colored. Ovary unilocular, many-ovuled. Berry spherical with\r\nmany seeds buried in pulp.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Blanco has seen the plant growing in Ilocos and Imus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIXINEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bixa Orellana_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Atsuiti_, _Achuiti_, Tag.; _Achiote_, _Achuete_, Sp.-Fil.;\r\n_Annatto_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The principal use of the seeds is in cookery and everybody\r\nknows the yellow color which Filipino cooks impart to almost all\r\ntheir dishes. In medicine the fine powder that covers the seeds is\r\nused as a hæmostatic and internally as a stomachic. On account of\r\nthe astringent qualities of the coloring matter it is used in some\r\ncountries to treat dysentery, a fact which suggests its possible\r\ntherapeutic or rather hygienic usefulness as a condiment. It seems\r\nto effect a cure in dysentery in the same manner as ipecac.\r\n\r\nIn India, Brazil and the Antilles the natives make a sort of paste\r\nof achuete known under the name of _rocu_. There is a hard, odorless\r\nform of rocu and another soft, unctuous, of a delicate red color and\r\nan odor rendered highly disagreeable by the urine added to it to keep\r\nit soft. Rocu is the preparation of achuete that has been subjected\r\nto chemical analysis. Its composition is as follows: Two coloring\r\nmatters, _bixin_ (C_28_H_34_O_5_), of a red color, resinous, soluble\r\nin alcohol, ether, alkaline solutions and benzine, crystallizing in\r\nmicroscopic laminæ, quadrangular, red, of a metallic violet lustre;\r\n_orellin_, yellow in color, soluble in alcohol and in water.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A well-known tree growing to a height\r\nof 5-7 meters, with leaves alternate, simple, oval, heart-shaped\r\nat the base, sharply pointed, glabrous, short petioles. Flowers in\r\npanicles. Calyx, 5 rounded sepals, tuberculate at the base, imbricated,\r\ncaducous. Corolla of 5 rose-colored petals. Stamens very numerous,\r\nfree, inserted on the receptacle. Capsule round, dark red, bristling\r\nwith stout hairs of the same color. The seeds are covered with a fine,\r\nyellowish-red powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pangium edule_, Reinw. (_Hydonocarpus polyandra_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Pangi_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--All parts of this tree are anthelmintic. The seeds, fruit,\r\nleaves and bark all possess narcotic properties dangerous to man and\r\nthe symptoms following an excessive dose are sleepiness, headache,\r\na sort of intoxication or an attack of delirium that may end in\r\ndeath. These narcotic properties have been utilized in Java to\r\nstupefy the fish in the rivers by throwing the bark in the pools\r\nand quiet portions of the stream. The juice of the leaves is used in\r\nthe treatment of chronic skin diseases. In Amboina the natives eat\r\nthe seeds, the toxic quality of which is removed by brushing and\r\nmacerating in pure water for a certain time. After such treatment\r\nthey may be eaten with impunity and an oil may be extracted from them\r\nwhich is useful as a food.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree with leaves 5' long, alternate,\r\novate, broad, entire, glabrous, palmately nerved. Petiole long with\r\n2 persistent lateral stipules. Flowers dioecious, the male ones in\r\npanicles, the female solitary. Calyx gamosepalous, dividing unequally\r\nwhen the flower opens. The male flower has a corolla of 5-7 petals,\r\nviolet-colored, concave, half oval, with pubescent borders; at its\r\nbase a flat scale. Stamens free, numerous, thick filaments, anthers\r\nbilocular. In the female flower the perianth is the same as in the\r\nformer, the stamens sterile. Ovary unilocular, with 2-4 parietal\r\nplacentæ with many ovules. Fruit as large as a man's head, with thin\r\nwoody pericarp and many seeds embedded within its pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTULACACEÆ.\r\n\r\nPurslane Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Portulaca oleracea_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Verdolagas_, Sp.; _Olasiman_, _Kolasiman_, Tag.;\r\n_Purslane_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The entire plant is edible, in the form of a salad or as\r\na condiment with meat or fish. The leaves are succulent and acid,\r\nand the juice expressed from them is used as an eyewash to remove\r\ncorneal opacities; it is also used in superficial erysipelas and\r\nother skin affections. The bruised leaves are used as a poultice for\r\nabscesses, contusions and on the temples for headache. The juice is\r\ngiven internally to check hæmoptysis and in diseases of the lungs\r\nand bladder; the seeds also are used in these complaints.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant with prostrate stem. Leaves fleshy,\r\nwedge-shaped. Flowers small, sessile, terminal, pale yellow. Calyx\r\nof 2 large teeth, deciduous. Corolla, 4-5 petals with a notch at the\r\nend. Stamens 9-14. Style of equal length with the stamens. Stigma in\r\n4-6 divisions. The seed vessel, which dehisces horizontally, contains\r\nmany small, heart-shaped seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--It grows in all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUTTIFERÆ.\r\n\r\nGamboge Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Garcinia mangostana_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Mangostán_, Sp.; _Mangosteen_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The seed of the fruit is astringent and is given internally\r\nas an infusion in dysentery and chronic diarrhoea. The decoction is\r\nvery useful as an injection in leucorrhoea.\r\n\r\nThe following potion has given excellent results to Dr. Ed. J. Waring\r\nin chronic dysentery and the diarrhoeas of tropical countries:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Dried peel of mangosteen       60 grams.\r\n        Cumin seed                      5 grams.\r\n        Coriander                       5 grams.\r\n        Water                       1,200 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoil till reduced to 600 grams. Take 120 grams twice a day. Tincture\r\nof opium may be added.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of mangosteen peel by W. Schmidt demonstrated a large\r\nquantity of tannin, a resin and a crystallizable principle named\r\n_mangostin_ (C_20_H_23_O_5_) which exists in the form of fine,\r\ngolden yellow laminæ, tasteless, soluble in alcohol, ether and the\r\nalkalies, insoluble in water. With the perchloride of iron it gives\r\na blackish-green color, and sulphuric acid colors it red.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The mangosteen grows only in the southern\r\nislands of the Archipelago and its delicious fruit is the part of\r\nthe plant known in Manila. The peel is at the present time almost\r\nuniversally employed in medicine. The fruit is about the size of\r\na small Manila orange, the pericarp a dark red or chocolate color,\r\ntough and thick, crowned with the remains of the calyx. On breaking\r\nit open the edible portion of the fruit is seen, consisting of 6-18\r\nseeds covered by a white, sweet pulp, cottony in appearance, of a\r\ndelicious slightly acrid flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Garcinia venulosa_, Choisy. (_Cambogia venulosa_, Blanco.)\r\n2. _G. Cambogia_, Desrouss. (_Cambogia binucao_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Binukaw_, Tag., applied to both trees, though the first\r\nis also called _Gatasan pulá_ in Tagalo and _Taklang-anak_ in Pampango.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit of the second species, the true name of which is\r\n_binucaw_, is acid and edible. The fruit and the trunk of both species,\r\nwhen cut, exude a gum-resin very much like gamboge which is obtained\r\nfrom the _G. morella_ or _G. pedicellata_, Desr. These gum-resins,\r\nhowever, seem to be much inferior to gamboge; they contain an essential\r\noil which does not exist in the latter and their color is paler.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The _G. venulosa_ is a tree with leaves\r\nopposite, lanceolate, acute, entire and glabrous, the inferior surface\r\ncovered with nervelets which converge at the apex. Petioles short and\r\nflattened. Flowers tetramerous. Calyx, 4 persistent sepals. Corolla,\r\n4 petals, overlapping, fleshy, ovate, of the same color as the\r\ncalyx. Stamens numerous; no filaments; anthers round and very\r\nsmall. Style very short and thick, stigma peltate, divided into 10\r\nparts. Fruit globose, depressed, no well-marked ridges when ripe.\r\n\r\n_G. Cambogia_ differs from the foregoing in the leaves which present\r\nno nervelets on the lower surface and the fruit which presents 8\r\nangles or rounded ridges.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common throughout the islands, abounding in the\r\nmountains of San Mateo and Morong. Blooms in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Garcinia morella_, Desr.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--I do not know the name given by the Filipinos to this\r\ntree, which Vidal and Soler have seen in Montalván, Tiwi (Albay)\r\nand San Mateo (Province of Manila); but it is highly important in\r\nmedicine as the true gamboge is obtained from it. _Gamboge Tree_, Eng.\r\n\r\nThe Gamboge of the U. S. P. and B. P. is obtained from _G. Hanburii_\r\nwhich differs somewhat botanically from _G. morella_.\r\n\r\nUses.--All parts of the plant contain a thick, yellow, milky juice\r\nwhich constitutes the gamboge. In Malabar, Ceylon, Canara and Singapore\r\nthe following method of extraction is followed: At the beginning of the\r\nrainy season a spiral incision is made around the bark of about half\r\nthe tree trunk, and a piece of bamboo is fixed in place to collect\r\nthe juice which slowly exudes from the cut for several months, soon\r\nbecoming viscid and then solid after contact with the air. One tree,\r\nas a rule, yields enough sap to fill three internodal segments of\r\nbamboo, each 50 cm. long by 3-5 cm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nGamboge is a laxative in doses of 10-15 cgm., produces abundant\r\nevacuations with violent colicky pains in doses of 30-50 cgm., and\r\nis an irritant poison in large doses. In other words it is a highly\r\nenergetic hydragogue cathartic, especially indicated when we wish\r\nto drain off the fluid element of the blood, as in dropsy, asthma,\r\npulmonary and cerebral congestion. It is also used as a vermifuge.\r\n\r\nIt is rarely given alone, but is combined with calomel, aloes, jalap,\r\nrhubarb, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is official in all pharmacopoeias.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 10-20 meters high, with leaves opposite,\r\nelliptical, lanceolate, narrowed at both extremities, acuminate,\r\nentire, coriaceous, glabrous, 10-12 cm. long by 3-4 cm. broad, with\r\nshort petioles. Flowers dioecious. Male flower axillary, solitary or in\r\ngroups of 3-6, pedunculate with small bracts. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla,\r\n4 petals, orbicular, thick, fleshy. Stamens 30-40, sessile, adherent\r\nat the base. Anthers unilocular. Female flower sessile, solitary,\r\naxillary, larger than the male; calyx and corolla equal; staminodia\r\n20-30, jointed at the base, forming a membranous corolla from the\r\nupper edge of which spring a few short filaments which support each\r\na suboval sterile anther. The ovary is superior and almost spherical,\r\nwith 4 cells each containing 1 ovule. The fruit, almost spherical, is\r\n2 1/2 cm. in diameter, corticate, bearing at its base the persistent\r\ncalyx; each of its 4 cells contains a seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ochrocarpus pentapetalous_, Blanco. (_Tovomita pentapetala_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Namakpakan_, _Tagudin_, Iloc. (?).\r\n\r\nUses.--An oil expressed from the fruit is used in Ilocos for\r\nilluminating purposes. The flowers are astringent and are used in\r\ninfusion in cases of diarrhoea. The oil of the fruit is also used\r\nlocally in rheumatism, tumefactions and other painful conditions. In\r\nsome countries of Malaysia the oil is used in the same way especially\r\nin beriberi and the periarticular inflammations incident to puerperium.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Straight trunk about 8' in diameter, with\r\nmilky sap. Leaves 1 1/2' long, sessile, opposite, ovate, expanded,\r\nminutely notched and glabrous, with a small downy swelling at\r\nthe base, superior and glued to the branch. Flowers terminal,\r\nin racemes, with opposite pedicels. Calyx white, of 2 rounded\r\nleaflets bent downwards. Corolla white, 5 petals (not 4), oval,\r\nconcave, twice as long as the calyx. Stamens numerous, joined to the\r\nreceptacle. Filaments slightly longer than the corolla. Anthers oval,\r\n2-celled. Ovary superior, oval. Style longer than the stamens. Stigma\r\npeltate, sometimes bilobed, sometimes 4-lobed. Fruit about the size\r\nof an acorn, oval, fleshy, containing a milky juice; it is 2-celled\r\nand each cell contains a solitary, hard seed; of these one aborts.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--It grows near the sea. Blooms in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calophyllum Inophyllum_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Palo Maria_, Sp.-Fil.; _Bitanhol_, _Tamawian_, _Dankalan_,\r\n_Dinkalin_, Tag.; _Dankalan Bitaog_, Vis., Pam., Bik.\r\n\r\nUses.--From the seeds of the fruit there exudes a yellowish-green oil,\r\nbitter and aromatic. It is used in some districts for illuminating\r\npurposes. Its density is 0.942 and its point of solidification 5°\r\nabove zero. In India it is used by inunction in rheumatism and in the\r\nPhilippines locally over the stomach in indigestion and colic. The\r\nbark of the tree when incised exudes a green resin of a very agreeable\r\nodor, which is used as an application to wounds and old sores. In\r\nIndia it is used in the same way. This resin is fusible and dissolves\r\ncompletely in alcohol. It has been mistaken for the _tacamahaca_\r\nof India, which, however, is a product of the _C. calaba_, L. Mixed\r\nwith equal parts of pitch and wax it is applied to the chest as a\r\nplaster in bronchitis. A decoction of the leaves is used for purulent\r\nophthalmia in some parts of India and Mauritius. The pounded bark is\r\napplied locally in orchitis and epididymitis. We have had occasion to\r\nuse a mixture of equal parts of the resin with white vaseline spread\r\non linen and applied between the shoulder blades; in the persistent\r\ncough of senile bronchitis the relief was marked.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large tree with beautiful, dark green\r\nleaves 4-5' long, opposite, entire, large, oval with nerves numerous,\r\nfine and perpendicular to the midrib. Petioles very short. Flowers\r\nlarge, white, sweet-scented, axillary, in racemes of 7-9. Calyx\r\nwhite, of 4 sepals. Corolla white, of 4 petals. Stamens numerous,\r\npolyadelphous. Ovary rudimentary in the male flower; unilocular and\r\nuniovulate in the female. Style single and large. Drupe superior,\r\nwith a hard, bony pit, containing a thicker, softer substance which\r\nenvelopes a seed of like consistency.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--It is found in central Luzon and in the Provinces of Tayabas,\r\nLa Union and Ilocos. Blooms in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mesua ferrea_, L. (_Calophyllum apetalum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Malabukbuk_ (?), Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--We do not know to what use the Filipinos put this plant, but\r\nin India the sweet flowers are dried and sold in the bazars under the\r\nname of _Nag-Kasar_ or _Nagesur_, which is used as a mild stimulant,\r\nbut especially as a perfume.\r\n\r\nA dark oil is expressed from the seeds, its density 0.954 and its\r\nsolidifying point 5° above zero. In northern Canara it is used locally\r\nin rheumatism. The incised root bark exudes a resinous sap which is\r\na good bitter tonic. The infusion of the wood is equally good. The\r\ndried flowers, finely powdered and mixed with oil or lard make a useful\r\nointment for acute hemorrhoids. The fruit is acrid and purgative.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree with leaves long-petioled, oblong,\r\nlanceolate, acuminate, rounded at the base, thick, coriaceous,\r\nupper surface lustrous, lower surface greenish or covered with a\r\nwaxy, ash-colored powder. Flowers terminal or axillary, solitary,\r\nyellowish. Calyx 4 imbricated sepals, orbiculate, slightly\r\npubescent. Corolla 4 persistent petals, wedge-shaped, short, with\r\nrounded points. Stamens indefinite, free, in 5-6 series. Ovary free,\r\n2-celled, each cell containing 2 ovules. Style bilobed. Fruit nearly\r\nunilocular, ovate, acuminate, encompassed at its base by the sepals,\r\nthe lower part of the petals, and crowned by the style. Pericarp\r\nwoody, dehiscent at the tip by 2-4 valves; contains 1-4 seeds,\r\nslightly orbiculate, coriaceous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in the forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPTEROCARPEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dipterocarpus turbinatus_, Gaertn. (_D. Indicus_, Bedd.; _D. Mayapis_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Mayapis_, Tag.; _Gurjun_, _Kanyin_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This tree yields an oleo resin, used in medicine and known\r\nunder the name of _bálsamo de gurjun_. Other species of _Dipterocarpus_\r\n(_D. alatus_, Roxb.; _D. incanus_, Roxb.; _D. trinervis_, Bl., etc.,\r\netc.) produce the same substance. Balsam of Gurjun is a stimulant\r\nof the mucous membranes, especially those of the genito-urinary\r\ntract, and is diuretic. It is also indicated in bronchial catarrh\r\nand as a local application in ulcer. The first to recommend the use\r\nof gurjun as a substitute for copaiba was Sir W. O'Shaughnessy in\r\n1838, and in 1852 this property was confirmed by Waring with highly\r\nsatisfactory results. Dr. Enderson of Glasgow employed it in cases\r\nthat received no benefit from copaiba, giving a teaspoonful t. i. d. in\r\nemulsion. Dr. Rean also classed it as equal to copaiba in efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe daily dose ranges from 5-20 grams, in liquid or pill.\r\n\r\nThe following is an excellent formula for an emulsion:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Cinnamon water                  125 grams.\r\n        Sodium carbonate, crystals        2 grams.\r\n        Balsam of gurjun                 25 grams.\r\n        Syrup of gum                     25 grams.\r\n        Sulphuric ether                   2 grams.\r\n\r\n        Mix and shake.\r\n\r\n\r\nDose.--6-12 large spoonfuls each day, for the declining stage of\r\ngonorrhoea.\r\n\r\nIn Burmah they extract the balsam by the following method: A large\r\nhole is cut in the trunk of the tree and a fire is built in this\r\ncavity and kept up till the wood of the trunk begins to burn, by\r\nwhich time the oleo resin has collected in abundance in the segments\r\nof bamboo placed to receive it. When the exudate diminishes, fire is\r\nagain placed in the cavity and one tree may tolerate 2, 3 or even 4\r\nof these cavities. The exudate on standing separates into 2 parts;\r\na solid called \"guad\" which forms the lower layer, and a supernatant\r\nliquid which is the balsam. It is dense, viscid and very fluorescent;\r\nopaque and gray-green by reflected light. It has an odor similar to\r\nthat of copaiba, is bitter and aromatic. Its density is 0.964. It\r\nis soluble in benzine, in bisulphuret of carbon, chloroform, the\r\nessential oils and less so in ether and acetic acid. It becomes turbid\r\nand coagulates if it be kept at 100° for some time and it solidifies\r\nat 200°, while copaiba remains liquid at this temperature.\r\n\r\nA specimen of the balsam examined by Flückiger consisted of 54.44\r\nparts semifluid resin and 45.56 volatile material. Upon distillation\r\nit yields an essential oil, of slight odor, straw-colored; formula\r\nC_20_H_32_ (Werner). If purified its density is 0.915. It is soluble\r\nin amylic alcohol, scarcely so in absolute alcohol. Hydrochloric acid\r\ncolors it a beautiful blue. The resin remaining after distillation,\r\ndissolved in alcohol 0.838 with the addition of ammonia, yields as a\r\nprecipitate a crystalline acid (gurjunic acid), C_44_H_64_O_8_, soluble\r\nin alcohol 0.838, in ether, in benzol and bisulphide of carbon. It\r\nmelts at 220° (Werner), solidifies at 180° and is decomposed at 260°.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A very large, handsome tree with leaves\r\nabout 5' in length, alternate, ovate, broad and lanceolate, entire,\r\nglabrous and membranaceous. Petioles very short. Flowers terminal,\r\npaniculate, handsome, fragrant. Calyx free, 5 lanceolate sepals, of\r\nwhich 2 are slightly longer than the others. Corolla, 5 yellow oblong\r\npetals longer than the sepals. Stamens numerous, attached to the\r\nreceptacle. Filaments very short. Anthers of 2 divisions each ending\r\nin a long beard. Ovary half buried in the receptacle. A single thick\r\nstyle. Three simple stigmas. Seed vessel of 3 cells, seeds in pairs.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In Luzon in the mountains of Tala, Angat and San Mateo;\r\nin Mindanao, Paragua, Balabac and Negros. Blooms in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALVACEÆ.\r\n\r\nMallow Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sida carpinifolia_, L. (_S. acuta_, Burm.; _S. stipulata_, Cav.;\r\n_S. frutescens_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Wawalisan_, _Eskobanghaba_, _Pamalis_, _Higot-balato_,\r\n_Mamalis_, Tag., Vis., Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root is emollient and bitter. The decoction is\r\nused as a lotion for ulcers, and internally as a sudorific and\r\ntonic-astringent. The physicians of India prescribe the powdered root\r\nwith milk for fevers and for nervous and urinary diseases. The leaves\r\nare used locally in ophthalmia.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the root is employed as a wash for all kinds of\r\nsores and ulcers and the juice of the entire plant is given for\r\nspermatorrhoea. After experimenting with the root, the compilers of\r\nthe Bengal Dispensatory announced their uncertainty as to whether\r\nor not it possessed antipyretic properties; however, they pronounce\r\nit diaphoretic, an exciter of the appetite and an excellent bitter\r\ntonic. In Goa the Portuguese consider it diuretic and use it especially\r\nin rheumatic affections.\r\n\r\nThe root of _S. carpinifolia_ gives a blue color with the salts of\r\niron. It does not precipitate gelatin and contains asparagin.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 2-4° high with woody, branching stem,\r\nleaves alternate, oblong, pointed, serrate, under surface neither\r\nhoary nor tomentose as in some other species of _Sida_. Petioles\r\nvery short, curved near the leaf, 2 stipules near the base. Flowers\r\naxillary, solitary. Calyx simple, in 5 parts. Corolla, 5 petals notched\r\nobliquely. Stamens numerous, inserted on the end of a column. Anthers\r\nglobose. Styles 5, mingled with the stamens. Stigmas globose. Cells\r\nof the same number as the styles, verticillate, with solitary seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon, Panay, Mindanao, Paragua, Cebú and Balabac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abutilon Indicum_, Don.

Vulg.--_Kuakuakohan_, _Giling-gilingan_, Tag.; _Tabing_, _Malis_,\r\n_Dulupag_, _Pilis_, Vis.; _Malvas de Castilla_, Sp.-Fil.\r\n\r\nUses.--The trunk bark is slightly bitter, and in decoction is used\r\nas a diuretic. An infusion of the leaves and flowers is used as an\r\nemollient in place of mallows. The infusion of the root is used for\r\nthe same effect, as a lotion or injection. I have often had occasion\r\nto employ this plant and would never use the _Philippine mallow_\r\nin place of it.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 3-4° high, all its parts covered with\r\nhairs, simple and tomentose. Leaves heart-shaped, angular, obtuse,\r\nunequally serrate, smooth, soft, the lower surface hoary and bearing\r\n9 well-marked nerves. Petioles longer than the leaves, with 2 stipules\r\nat the base. Flowers yellow, axillary, solitary. Peduncles long, with\r\na node near the end. Calyx, 5 sepals, as in all the Malvaceæ. Corolla,\r\n5 petals with a small notch at the end. Stamens very numerous as well\r\nas the styles. Both arise from the summit of a very short column and\r\ntwist in all directions forming a tassel or tuft. Fruit much higher\r\nthan the calyx, of 10-20 cells or carpels which are broad, compressed,\r\nhairy, the walls united toward the center, each containing 2-3 seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon, Panay, Mindanao and other islands. Blooms\r\nin September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Urena sinuata_, L. (_U. morifolia_ and _muricata_, DC.;\r\n_U. multifida_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kulutan_, _Kulutkulutan_, _Molopolo_, Tag., Vis., Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--The infusion of the root is used internally as an emollient\r\nand refrigerant; externally in skin diseases accompanied by smarting\r\nand inflammation. The boiled and pounded leaves are used as a poultice\r\nin inflammation of the intestines and bladder.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A spreading plant 4-6° high, with straight\r\nstem, leaves cleft at the base, serrate and hairy; the larger ones\r\nhave 5-6 lobules which subdivide into smaller ones and bear a small\r\ngland in the inferior surface of the midrib. Petioles short. Flowers\r\nterminal and racemose. Calyx double, composed of 5 narrow sepals\r\nexternally, and 5 colored sepals internally alternating with the\r\nouter ones. Corolla, 5 petals.

Five united carpels, kidney-shaped,\r\nbristling with short stiff hairs, containing solitary seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hibiscus Abelmoschus, L._\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kastuli_, _Kastio_, _Kastiogan_, _Dalupan_, Tag.;\r\n_Marikum_, _Dukum_, _Marukum_, _Marapoto_, Vis.; [2] _Marsh Mallow_,\r\nEng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The bruised seeds emit an odor of musk, and for this reason\r\nthe plant has received the name _Kastuli_, signifying musk in\r\nSanscrit. They possess antispasmodic and stimulant properties, and the\r\ninfusion is diuretic. Bonastre [3] analyzed Kastuli seeds as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Water and parenchyma                    52.00\r\n        Gum                                     36.00\r\n        Albumin                                  5.60\r\n        Fixed oil, resin, crystals and\r\n        odorous principles                       6.40\r\n                                               ------\r\n            Total                              100.00\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fixed oil is greenish-yellow, fluid, but gradually solidifying\r\nin the air. The crystalline material is white, of an agreeable odor,\r\nsoluble in ether, where it crystallizes in rays, fusible at 35°. The\r\nodorous principle is a bright green, non-volatile liquid of the odor\r\nof musk.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 5-6° high, the stem hairy and with\r\nfew branches. Leaves heart-shaped, cleft at the base, with 5 large\r\npointed lobes, serrate, pubescent. Petioles long with two awl-shaped\r\nstipules at the base, and a large violet spot in the axil. Calyx\r\ndouble; the outer sepals 8-9 in number, awl-shaped; the inner ones\r\nare larger and separate unequally when the flower expands. Both sets\r\nare deciduous. Corolla very large, yellow. Stamens very numerous,\r\ninserted around a column. One pistil. Five stigmas. Ovary very large,\r\ndowny, ovoid, 5-angled, with 5 compartments, each containing many\r\nkidney-shaped seeds with numerous grooves concentric at the hilum.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hibiscus tiliaceus, L._\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Balibago_, Tag., Pam.; _Malabago_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--An infusion of the leaves is used as a wash for ulcers and\r\nindolent sores. The flowers boiled in milk are used to relieve the\r\npain of earache (Blanco), the warm milk being dropped into the external\r\ncanal. The powdered bark in dose of 3 grams is emetic(?) (Blanco).\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree 6-12° high with leaves 4-6' long,\r\nalternate, 7-nerved, cleft at the base, abruptly acute, scalloped,\r\npubescent. Petioles long. Flowers axillary, in panicles of very small\r\nflowerets. Calyx double, the outer portion divided into 8-9 teeth,\r\nthe inner into 5 longer parts. Stamens numerous, inserted about a\r\ncolumn. Style 1. Stigmas 5. Ovary of 5 cells, each containing 2 seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Abounds in all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis, L._\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Takurangan_, _Aronganan_, _Kayanga_, _Tapulanga_,\r\n_Gumamila_, Tag., Vis., Pam.; _Rose of China_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The flowers are emollient and are widely used by the Filipinos\r\nas a domestic remedy; they are bruised and applied to boils, tumors\r\nand all sorts of inflammations. The decoction is much used internally\r\nin bronchial catarrh for its sudorific effect.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese use the trunk bark as an emmenagogue, calling it\r\nFu-yong-pi.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree about 7° high commonly called\r\n_Gumamela_ in Manila; the leaves are ovate, acute, with about 5 nerves,\r\nserrate from the middle to the apex, hairs growing sparsely on both\r\nsurfaces, with a small group of dark-colored, deciduous hairs growing\r\non the lower part of the midrib. Petioles short with 2 stipules at\r\nthe base. Calyx double, the outer part divided almost to the base\r\ninto 6-8 parts; the inner cylindrical, divided in 5. Corolla large,\r\nsplendid scarlet-red, often double, on slender peduncles. Styles\r\nnumerous. Fruit identical with that of the _Hibiscus tiliaceus_.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Universally common in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thespesia populnea_, Corr.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Babuy_ or _Bobuy gubat_, Tag.; _Bulakan_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit yields a yellow juice which is used locally in\r\nthe itch and other cutaneous troubles, after first washing the\r\naffected part with a decoction of the roots and leaves. The bark is\r\nastringent and is used as a decoction in the treatment of dysentery\r\nand hemorrhoids.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree of the second order with leaves 4-5'\r\nlong, sparse, 5-nerved, heart-shaped, broad, acute, entire, glabrous,\r\n6 small glands on the lower face of the base. Petioles of equal length\r\nwith the leaves. Flowers large, axillary, solitary. Calyx double,\r\nthe outer portion deciduous, consisting of 3 small, acute leaflets\r\ninserted on the base of the inner calyx; the inner is bell-shaped,\r\nlarger than the outer, with 5 inconspicuous, persistent teeth. Corolla\r\nfour times longer than the calyx, of 5 fleshy, fluted petals, their\r\nborders overlapping, much broader above. Stamens very numerous,\r\narranged around and along a column. Filaments long. Anthers of\r\nhalf-moon shape. Style 1, very thick. Stigma cleft in 5 parts, which\r\nare twisted in spiral form. Seed vessels about the size of a filbert,\r\n5-sided, with 5 apartments each containing 5 ovoid seeds attached\r\nby separate seed stalks to the central axis of the ovary. Seeds\r\nnot woolly.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Mandaloya Tayabas, Iloilo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gossypium herbaceum_, L. (_G. Indicum_, Lam.; _G. Capas_, Rumph.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Algodón_, Sp.; _Bulak_, Tag.; _Cotton_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root bark is antiasthmatic, emmenagogue, and according\r\nto Daruty [4] is a substitute for ergot in uterine hemorrhage. The\r\nleaves are used in bronchial troubles and the seeds are sudorific. The\r\nnegroes in the United States use the root bark in large doses as an\r\nabortifacient; but a dose of 60 grams to 1,200 of water in decoction\r\nis proper and useful in treating dysmenorrhoea.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the seeds went to waste but industry has learned to\r\nobtain from them a brownish-red oil which is used as a substitute for\r\nolive oil, from which it is hard to distinguish it, if the latter\r\nis adulterated by mixing the two; for both have the same density\r\nand a very similar odor and taste. For this reason the production\r\nof cottonseed oil is very considerable nowadays. It is cheap and\r\nexcellent for domestic, industrial and pharmaceutic use.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are used in North America in dysentery and as a galactagogue,\r\nand the juice of the leaves as an emollient in diarrhoea and mild\r\ndysentery. The pulp of the seeds, after the oil is extracted, yields\r\na sweet material called _gossypose_, which is dextrogyrous and has\r\nthe formula C_18_H_32_O_16_ + 5H_2_O.\r\n\r\nThe cotton itself, the part used in commerce as a textile, is also the\r\nportion of the plant most widely employed in therapeutics; not only\r\nthe fiber from this species is used, but also that of others that grow\r\nin the Philippines, the _G. Barbadense_, L. (nom. vulg. _Pernambuko_,\r\nTag.), and the _G. arboreum_, L. (_Bulak na bundok_, _Bulak na totoo_,\r\nTag.).\r\n\r\nCotton is used extensively in bacteriological laboratories as a\r\nfilter of liquids and gases. This property possessed by cotton,\r\nof retaining in its fibers the germs of the air was utilized by\r\nthe famous French surgeon Guérin in the treatment that bears his\r\nname. The denuded surfaces exposed to infection by airborne bacteria\r\nare completely protected against them when, according to the Guérin\r\ntreatment, they are enveloped in large masses of fresh, raw cotton,\r\npresumably free from microörganisms. To avoid the possibility of\r\ninfection by the cotton itself, it is now the practice to sterilize\r\nit either by means of chemicals such as carbolic acid, iodoform,\r\netc., or by physical means such as high temperatures.\r\n\r\nRaw cotton is used in compounding gun cotton or explosive cotton, also\r\nnamed _pyroxylin_, and this is used to make collodion, so extensively\r\nemployed in medicine.\r\n\r\nPyroxylin is made by treating cotton with equal parts of nitric and\r\nsulphuric acids, then washing with water till the latter ceases to\r\ngive a precipitate with chloride of baryta; then dry in the air.\r\n\r\nCollodion is made by dissolving 5 grams of pyroxylin in the following\r\nmixture:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Sulphuric ether, rectified          75 grams.\r\n        Alcohol at 95°                      20 grams.\r\n\r\nFilter.\r\n\r\nElastic collodion:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Canada Balsam                    1.50 grams.\r\n        Castor oil                        .50 grams.\r\n        Collodion                       30.00 grams.\r\n\r\nMix.\r\n\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 2-3° high, of herbaceous stem, branches\r\nsparsely covered with small, black points; leaves cleft at their base,\r\nwith 5 lobules and a small gland on the midrib. Petiole long with\r\n2 stipules at the base. Flowers axillary, solitary. Calyx double;\r\nthe outer portion divided in 3 parts, heart-shaped, and each with\r\n5-9 long, acute teeth. Corolla bell-shaped, of 5 petals, pale yellow\r\nor turning rose color, purple at the base. Stamens many, inserted\r\non a column. Stigma in 4-5 parts. Ovary of 3-5 compartments. Seeds\r\nenveloped in the fiber.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Batangas, Ilocos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bombax malabaricum_, DC. (_B. Ceiba_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Taglinaw_, _Bobuy gubat_, Tag.; _Talutu_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--In India the roots are used to obtain an astringent and\r\nalterative effect and form part of a well-known aphrodisiac mixture\r\ncalled _Musla-Samul_. If the trunk is incised, an astringent gum exudes\r\nand this they use in diarrhoea, dysentery and menorrhagia. Dose of\r\nthe gum 2 1/2-3 grams.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large tree covered with sharp, conical\r\nand tough spines. Leaves alternate, compound, digitate, caducous;\r\nleaflets 5-7 with long common petiole. Flowers solitary or in axillary\r\ncymes, hermaphrodite, regular. Calyx gamosepalous, cup-shaped, with\r\n5 acute lobules. Corolla violet, with 5 deep clefts; æstivation\r\nconvolute. Stamens numerous, united at the base in 5 bundles,\r\nfree above, bearing unilocular anthers. Ovary of 5 many-ovulate\r\ncompartments, with a style ending in 5 short branches. Capsule woody,\r\novoid, loculicidal, with 5 valves. Seeds numerous, black, covered\r\nwith cottony fibers.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Angat, Iloilo. Blooms in February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eriodendron anfractuosum_, DC. (_Bombax pentandrum_, L.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Boboy_, Tag.; _Doldol_, Vis.; _Bulak kastila_, Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--The principal use made of this plant in the Philippines is to\r\nstuff the pillows with the cotton that it yields. The leaves, pounded\r\nwith a little water, yield a mucilaginous juice highly prized by the\r\nnatives as a wash for the hair, mixing it with _gogo_. The root bark\r\nis emetic in dose of 1.25 grm. The cotton yielded by this tree should\r\nbe used for the same therapeutic purposes as that of gossypium, and\r\nbeing of an exceedingly fine fiber it would give better results. The\r\nFilipinos use it to treat burns and sores. I have often used it,\r\nbeing careful always to impregnate it thoroughly with some antiseptic\r\nsolution. In the treatment of burns it has been my custom to envelope\r\nthe part in a thick layer of this cotton, after bathing it with a\r\ntepid 1-2,000 solution of corrosive sublimate and dusting with a very\r\nfine powder of boracic acid.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 40-50° high. Trunk somewhat thorny, the\r\nbranches horizontal, arranged in stars of 3-4. Leaves compound with\r\n7 leaflets, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers in umbels of 8 or\r\nmore flowerets. No common peduncle, the individual ones long. Calyx,\r\n5 obtuse sepals, slightly notched. Corolla, 5 fleshy petals, obtusely\r\nlanceolate and bent downwards. Stamens 5. Anthers of irregular shape,\r\npeltate, with the borders deeply undulate. Stigma in 5 parts. Pod 4-6'\r\nlong, spindle-shaped. Seeds enveloped in very fine cotton fiber.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Exceedingly common in all parts of the islands. Blooms\r\nin December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERCULIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nSterculia Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sterculia foetida_, L. (_S. polyphilla_, R. Br.; _Clompanus major_,\r\nRumph.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kalumpang_, Tag.; _Bangar_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--A decoction of the leaves is used as a wash in suppurative\r\ncutaneous eruptions. The fruit is astringent and is used in Java as\r\nan injection for gonorrhoea. In western India and in the Philippines\r\nit is an article of diet. The seeds yield an oil that is used for\r\nillumination and as a comestible.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large tree of the first order with digitate\r\nleaves of 6-8 leaflets, broad, oval, very acute, tough, glabrous,\r\ngrowing on a long common petiole. No petiole proper. Flowers of a\r\nfoetid or feculent odor, hermaphrodite, in compound racemes. Calyx\r\nfleshy, soft pubescent internally, bell-shaped, in 5 parts. Corolla\r\nnone. Nectary 5-toothed, on the end of a small column. Stamens\r\n15, inserted on the border of the nectary by threes, forming a\r\ntriangle. Filament almost entirely wanting. In the midst of the stamens\r\nis visible a small, hairy body of 5 lobules which are the rudiments of\r\nthe ovaries. The style protrudes and twists downwards. Stigma thick,\r\ncompressed, of 5 lobules. Fruit, five woody pods, semicircular,\r\njoined to a common center, each enclosing many oval seeds inserted\r\nin the superior suture.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon, Mindanao, Cebú, Iloilo. Blooms in March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sterculia urens_, Roxb. (_S. cordifolia_, Blanco; _Cavallium urens_,\r\nSchott. & Endl.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Banilad_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root bark is pounded up and applied locally in orchitis\r\nand in severe contusions with supposed fracture of the bones; native\r\ncharlatans pretend to cure the latter condition by this treatment.\r\n\r\nThe trunk exudes a sort of gum, which with water forms a sort of\r\ncolorless, odorless gelatin which dissolves at the boiling point. I\r\ndo not know to what use this gum is applied in therapeutics, but it\r\nis often found mixed with the Senegambian gum acacia.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree with leaves bunched, 7-9-veined,\r\nheart-shaped, ovate, broad and entire, glabrous upper surface,\r\nshort white down on lower surface. Petioles of same length as the\r\nleaves. Flowers small, yellow, numerous, polygamous, growing in\r\nlarge, terminal panicles covered with a fine, sticky down. Calyx\r\nbell-shaped, 5 acute papyraceous divisions, each bearing a small\r\ngland near its base. No corolla. Stamens 10, united in a column, the\r\nupper ends free. Five pods joined at one point, half-moon shaped,\r\nwith woody shell, glabrous within and with a short down on the\r\nouter surface. Three or four kidney-shaped seeds, the testa thin\r\nand crustaceous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Cebú, Iloilo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kleinhovia hospitata_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tanag_, Tag., Vis.; _Hamitanago_, Vis.; _Panampat_,\r\nPam.; _Bitnong_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--The decoction of the leaves is used, according to P. Blanco,\r\nto cure the itch. It is also used locally in all forms of dermatitis,\r\nand the tender leaves and sprouts are cooked and eaten.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Tree 25° high or more, with leaves alternate,\r\nheart-shaped, pubescent, almost entire. Petioles long with 2 stipules\r\nat the base. Flowers red, axillary, in large panicles. Calyx, 5 sepals,\r\nalmost linear. Corolla the same size as the calyx, 5 linear petals,\r\nthe lower shorter and curved. Nectary bell-shaped, of 5 parts, each\r\n3-toothed; set on a column; at its base a wavy fringe with dentate\r\nedge. Stamens 15. No filaments. Anthers seated on the 15 teeth of\r\nthe nectary.

Flowers in March and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Helicteres Isora_, L. (_H. chrysocalyx_, Miq.; _H. Roxburghii_,\r\nG. Don.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--(?); _Indian Screw Tree_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--I am ignorant of the use that the Filipinos make of this\r\nplant, though it is very possible that they do not employ it at all\r\nin medicine, which is usually the case with those plants to which they\r\nhave given no name. In India the peculiar spiral form of the fruit has\r\nsuggested its application, according to the theories of the doctrine\r\nof symbolism. Ainslie says that the Hindoos use it to treat diseases\r\nof the external auditory canal. On account of its emollient properties\r\nand probably on account of its twisted form, it is used internally as\r\na decoction, in flatulence and the intestinal colic of children. It\r\nis indispensable in the marriage ceremonies of the caste of Vaisya,\r\namong whom it is customary for the groom to wear on his wrists in\r\nthe form of bracelets, strings of this fruit combined with that of\r\n_Randia dumetorum_.\r\n\r\nThe root yields a juice which is employed in skin diseases, in abscess,\r\nacid in cardialgia. In Jamaica the juice of the leaves is sometimes\r\nused for constipation.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree with leaves alternate, simple,\r\nentire, irregularly nerved or veined at the base, petiolate. Flowers\r\nof a handsome red color, hermaphrodite, regular, axillary. Calyx\r\ngamosepalous, tubular, of 5 parts. Corolla, 5 free petals slightly\r\ndentate at the point. Stamens numerous, united on a free column on the\r\ncusp. Compound nectary of 5 unilocular, many-ovuled ovaries. Styles 5,\r\njoined at the base. Fruit of 5 carpels, thin, twisted on themselves\r\nin spirals, forming a cone, pubescent, of a greenish-brown color,\r\neach containing a single row of angular seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon, Panay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abroma fastuosa_, R. Br. (_A. angulata_, Lam.; _A. communis_, Blanco;\r\n_A. augusta_, L.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Anibong_, Tag.; _Anabo_, Vis.; _Perennial Indian Hemp_,\r\nEng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root bark is used in India as an emmenagogue in the\r\ncongestive and neuralgic forms of amenorrhoea. It seems to act as\r\na uterine tonic. The dose is 2 grams of the juice of the fresh root\r\nmixed with pepper which also acts as a carminative and stomachic.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub 3-4 meters high with hairy\r\nbranches. Leaves opposite, oval, oblong, serrate, tomentose. Flowers\r\npurple, solitary, terminal. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens\r\n5, united in the form of a tube. Ovary sessile, with 5 many-ovuled\r\ncompartments. Styles 5, united in the form of a tube which divides\r\ninto 5 stigma-bearing branches. Capsule membranous, 5-angled, truncate,\r\ndehiscent at apex. Seeds albuminous, covered with filaments of cotton.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--San Mateo, La Laguna, Batangas, Iloilo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Theobroma Cacao_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Cacao._\r\n\r\nUses.--The roasted bean ground with sugar constitutes chocolate,\r\none of the most generally used foods of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIt is very nutritious by virtue of the fat and sugar it contains,\r\nbut all stomachs do not bear it well and its use is the unsuspected\r\ncause of much dyspepsia. The custom of drinking it very hot and\r\nfollowing with a large quantity of cold water is a very common\r\ncause of dilatation of the stomach in the Philippines. The seed\r\nof the cacao contains several substances: cacao butter, albumin,\r\ntheobromine, starch, glucose, gum, tartaric acid, free or combined,\r\ntannin, and mineral substances. Of these the butter and theobromine\r\nare the most important.\r\n\r\nTheobromine (C_7_H_8_N_4_O_2_) is a weak alkaloid, crystalline,\r\nslightly bitter, slightly soluble in cold water, more soluble in hot\r\nwater, less soluble in alcohol and ether; stable in the air up to\r\n100°; sublimes without decomposition at 290° in microscopic crystals\r\nof the form of rhomboid prisms ending in an octohedric point (Keller).\r\n\r\nThis alkaloid is very little used in therapeutics and its physiological\r\naction is said to be analogous to that of caffeine but weaker. It\r\nis better to use the salt of the alkaloid, and that most frequently\r\nemployed is the salicylate of soda and theobromine in doses of from\r\n2 to 6 grams daily in solution or pill. Lately, however, Dr. Gram\r\nhas maintained that theobromine is a powerful diuretic operating when\r\nother diuretics fail and further that this effect is produced without\r\ninjuring the heart. The double salt is non-toxic, though sometimes in\r\nexceedingly weak patients it produces vertigo. Dr. Gram administers\r\n6 grams a day in one-gram doses.\r\n\r\nCacao butter is a white substance, slightly yellowish, unctuous to\r\nthe touch, brittle; with the agreeable odor peculiar to cacao, and a\r\nsweet and pleasant taste. Its density is 0.961, it melts at 30°-33°,\r\nand solidifies at 25°. It dissolves in 20 parts of boiling alcohol,\r\nin 100 parts of cold alcohol and in twice its weight of benzin. Cacao\r\nbutter is obtained by grinding or mashing the roasted seeds in a hot\r\napparatus and mixing the mass with a fifth or tenth of its weight of\r\nboiling water. It is then pressed between two hot iron plates and\r\nthe butter thus obtained is refined by boiling water. It is then\r\nput aside in earthen pans, or still better, in moulds, where it\r\nsolidifies. It does not easily become rancid and, for this reason,\r\nenters into the composition of many ointments and pomades, or is\r\nused alone. It serves as the base for suppositories and is, finally,\r\na highly valued cosmetic. A common substitute is made by mixing oil\r\nof almonds, wax and animal fat.\r\n\r\nBefore going further let us describe the composition of Spanish\r\nchocolate according to the French chemist Boussingault:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Cane sugar                  41.40  grams.\r\n        Cacao butter                29.24  grams.\r\n        Starch, glucose              1.48  grams.\r\n        Theobromine                  1.93  grams.\r\n        Asparagin                    a trace\r\n        Albumin                      6.25  grams.\r\n        Gum                          1.42  grams.\r\n        Tartaric acid                1.98  grams.\r\n        Tannin and coloring matter   0.022 grams.\r\n        Soluble cellulose            6.21  grams.\r\n        Ash                          2.34  grams.\r\n        Water                        4.36  grams.\r\n        Undetermined material        3.27  grams.\r\n                                   ------\r\n                                   100.00\r\n\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree about 10° high, with leaves broad,\r\n6-12' long, hanging or drooping, lanceolate, entire, and somewhat\r\npubescent on both surfaces. Petioles very short with 2 deciduous\r\nstipules at the base. Flowers in clusters on the roots, trunk and\r\nbranches. Peduncle very long. Nectary divided in 5 parts, straight,\r\nawl-shaped and 2-nerved. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals curved\r\nupward in the form of a bow as far as the middle, where they form a\r\nhollow with two little horns; then curving downwards, then upwards,\r\nwidening at the end, the edge finely dentate. Stamens 5, inserted on\r\nthe nectary, and alternating with the lobes of the latter. Anthers\r\n2 on each filament, concealed in the hollows of the petals. Ovary\r\nglobose. Style awl-shaped. Stigma cleft almost to the middle,\r\n5-parted. Fruit broad, spindle-shaped, 4' or more long, dark reddish,\r\nwarty, 10-ribbed, with 5 compartments each containing many compressed,\r\novoid seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in orchards and gardens throughout the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERANIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nGeranium Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oxalis corniculata_, L. (_O. Acetosella_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Taingan dogá, Susokayoli_, Tag.; _Darasig_, Vis.;\r\n_Malabalugbug dagis_, _Ayo_, _Kongi_, _Yayo_, Pam.; _Indian Sorrel_,\r\nEng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The part of the plant used in medicine is the leaf which is acid\r\nby virtue of the potassium oxalate which it contains. The decoction is\r\nused internally as an antipyretic in fevers and in dysentery. Mistaking\r\nthe properties of the plant it is given for vesical calculus which,\r\nif composed of oxalates, would be increased instead of diminished by\r\nthe treatment. In fact the salt of sorrel in the leaves contains a\r\nlarge quantity of oxalic acid mixed with potassium oxalate. In China,\r\nIndia and the Philippines the entire plant is used as an antiscorbutic.\r\n\r\nThe cold infusion of the leaves is given internally in doses of from\r\n30 to 60 grams, but it is not a medicine to be given indiscriminately,\r\nbecause in addition to its power of adding to the bulk of calculi of\r\nthe oxalates, the contained potassium oxalate is poisonous in doses\r\nof 25 to 30 grams. If a concentrated solution is taken, it operates as\r\na corrosive poison, producing violent pains in the stomach, vomiting,\r\nfaintness and great weakness. If the solution is dilute its absorption\r\nis rapid and it operates very energetically. When a patient is poisoned\r\nby a concentrated solution, the stomach-pump is contraindicated,\r\nbecause the mucous membrane of the organ is corroded and ulcerated;\r\nif by a dilute solution, use the pump to remove as much of the poison\r\nas possible. The best antidote is a watery solution of a soluble salt\r\nof lime, _i. e._, the saccharate, which forms an insoluble salt with\r\noxalic acid.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the leaves is an antidote for the _Datura_\r\n(Stramonium). In India they make a decoction of the plant, mix it with\r\nonion juice and apply it to the head as a fomentation in hemicrania.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 1° high, with a creeping, glabrous\r\nstem, leaves horizontal, ternate with common long petiole. Leaflets\r\nsessile, obcordate, with downy borders. Flowers axillary or terminal,\r\nfrom 1 to 3 in number on a common long peduncle. The pedicel is\r\nalso long. Calyx common to the family. Corolla, 5 petals ending in\r\nsmall claws. Stamens 10, monadelphous, the 5 shorter ones bearing\r\neach a small gland on the outer surface of the base. Ovary large,\r\nfluted. Styles 5, short. Stigmas hemispherical. Seed vessel pyramidal,\r\ncontaining many seeds enveloped in an elastic aril by which they are\r\nejected when the fruit opens.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Abundant in Luzon, Panay and Cebú.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Biophytum sensitivum_, DC. (_B. cumiagianum_, Turez.; _Oxalis\r\nsensitivum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Makahiya_, _Damonghiya_, Tag.; _Mahihiin_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--A decoction of the leaves is used internally as an\r\nexpectorant. The bruised leaves are used as an application to wounds\r\nand contusions. In Java the decoction is used internally in asthma,\r\nphthisis and snake bites.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar property which this plant possesses of closing its\r\nleaves when touched, has caused the natives of India to attribute\r\nto it mysterious virtues. Symbolism has determined its therapeutic\r\napplication and the Hindoos pretend that it endows with delicacy and\r\nmodesty women who lack these virtues and that it restores virginity.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant about 7' high. Stem straight, nodose\r\nand without branches. Leaves abruptly pinnate, the place of the odd\r\nleaflet taken by a stylet. The leaflets nearly linear with a small\r\npoint at the apex, 11-13 pairs, 2 stipules to each pair. Common\r\npetioles long, cleft at the base and disposed in whorls around and\r\non the end of the stem. Flowers sessile, verticillate, on the ends\r\nof several very long peduncles which rise from the midst of the\r\npetioles. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals, clawed, rounded at the\r\nend and slightly notched, forming a tube. Stamens 10, free. A small\r\ngland on the outer surface of the base of each short stamen. Styles\r\n5. Seed vessels ovate, 5-angled, containing many seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Averrhoa Bilimbi_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kamias_, _Kalamias_, Tag.; _Kilingiwa_, Vis.; _Pias_,\r\nIloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--The small fruit of the camia springing from the branches\r\nand trunks of the trees is widely known in the Philippines, where\r\nthey eat it green, pickled, and in salad; and when ripe fresh and\r\npreserved. Its qualities and therapeutic applications are the same\r\nas those of the following species.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 4-5 meters high with\r\nodd-pinnate leaves. Leaflets 12 pairs, ovate, linear, acute,\r\nsoft and downy. Flowers small, pinkish or purplish, on trunk and\r\nbranches. Stamens 10, five alternately longer. Pistils divergent. Fruit\r\noblong, obtuse at the end, with five broad ribs.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common throughout the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Averrhoa Carambola_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bilimbin_, _Balimbin_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The common name of this tree, whose fruit is so common, causes\r\nit to be confused with the name which Linnæus gives to the former\r\nspecies. Balimbin is a fruit of an acid taste, agreeable when ripe,\r\nserving the same uses for food as the camia. Its acidity is due to\r\nthe presence of oxalic acid, which makes the green fruit useful for\r\nremoving ink and rust stains from clothes. The juice of the fruit is\r\nrefreshing and is given internally mixed with water and sugar as a\r\nrefreshing drink in fevers and as an antiscorbutic. For the latter\r\nthe ripe fruit is eaten uncooked.\r\n\r\nIn Mauritius the juice is used to treat dysentery and hepatitis. Padre\r\nBlanco says that the natives use a decoction of camias and unthreshed\r\nrice in diarrhoea and bilious colic. In connection with the subject\r\nof camias and balimbins we should mention the fruit treatment of the\r\nbilious diarrhoea of the tropics, spoken of by the French physicians\r\nof Cochin China. Dr. Van der Burg of the Dutch Indies also strongly\r\nrecommends the treatment of diarrhoea by fruits; in temperate regions\r\nusing fruits like peaches, pears, etc., and in the tropics, lychies,\r\nmangosteens, etc. In regard to the mangosteens we must not forget that,\r\nwhile the bark is given because of the amount of tannin it contains,\r\nthe composition of the pulp is very different. The fruit acids seem\r\nto exercise great influence in the cure of this obstinate disease\r\nand I do not hesitate to recommend for this purpose the camia and\r\nthe ripe balimbin.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree much like the former. Leaves\r\nodd-pinnate. Leaflets, 3-4 pairs, obliquely ovate, acute, the terminal\r\nleaflet nearly lanceolate. Flowers on the trunk, branches and in the\r\naxils of the leaves. Fruit oblong, with 5 very prominent acute-angled\r\nribs.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--It grows, like the former plant, in all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUTACEÆ.\r\n\r\nRue Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ruta graveolens, L._ (_L. angustifolia_, Pers.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Rudu_, Sp.; _Rue_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The rue of the European, American and Indian pharmacopoeias\r\nis emmenagogue, antispasmodic, anthelmintic, excitant, diaphoretic,\r\nantiseptic and abortive. It contains an essential oil, and rutinic\r\nacid (C_25_H_28_O_15_, Borntrager), starch, gum, etc. The essential\r\noil is greenish-yellow, thick, acrid and bitter; specific gravity\r\n0.911. It boils at 228°, is slightly soluble in water, and soluble\r\nin absolute alcohol. It is promptly oxidized by nitric acid, and is\r\nconverted into pelargonic acid and other fatty acids.\r\n\r\nRutin (or rutinic acid), according to Weiss, is a glucoside which\r\nexists in the form of fine needles, bright yellow in color. It is\r\nslightly soluble in cold water and more so in boiling water. It melts\r\nat 190°, and solidifies at freezing point, forming a resinous mass. Its\r\nphysiological properties are as yet unknown. The part of the plant\r\nemployed is the leaves, which owe their property, apparently, to the\r\nessential oil they contain, from which they also derive their strong\r\nand disagreeable odor and their bitter, acrid and nauseous taste.\r\n\r\nIt is used principally as a uterine stimulant or emmenagogue, for which\r\npurpose it is given in doses of 0.10-0.15 centigrams of the freshly\r\npowdered leaf and 0.05-0.10 centigrams of the fresh leaves infused in a\r\nliter of water. The dry powder of the leaf should not be used because\r\nthe essential oil volatilizes and a large proportion of it is lost,\r\nwhich is the most active principle of the drug. It is an agent which\r\nshould be prescribed with the greatest prudence for large doses are\r\npoisonous even to the point of causing death. The symptoms following\r\nsuch doses are colic, vomiting, bloody diarrhoea and tenesmus.\r\n\r\nIt is also used as an antihemorrhagic after childbirth, but its action\r\nis slow, not being felt for several hours after the administration of\r\nthe drug; for this reason it cannot take the place of ergot, though\r\nit seems to be superior to the latter in passive hemorrhages. The\r\nessential oil is given internally in doses of 2-6 drops on a piece\r\nof sugar. It is sometimes used as an antispasmodic in hysteria,\r\nepilepsy and chorea.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese make extensive use of this drug and it is one of their\r\nprincipal abortives. In Hindostan the dried leaves are burnt and the\r\nsmoke inhaled as a cure for catarrh in children. They are careful\r\nnot to administer it to pregnant women.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant, 1 meter high, with leaves alternate,\r\ncompound, the inferior ones 2-3-cleft; leaflets narrow, oblong,\r\nslightly fleshy. Flowers greenish-yellow, hermaphrodite, arranged in\r\ncorymbose terminal cymes. Corolla, 4-5 free, concave petals. Calyx\r\ndeeply divided, persistent. Stamens 8-10, free, in two whorls, inserted\r\nbeneath a thick disc. Ovaries 5, unilocular, many-ovuled. Styles 5,\r\nfirst free, then united, forming a column terminating in a small\r\nstigma. Follicles 5, united at the base, 1 centimeter long, free\r\nsuperiorly, hard, rounded, rugose, opening on top. Seeds ovoid,\r\nangular, blackish, albuminous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common everywhere in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Xanthoxylum oxyphyllum_, Edgew. (_X. violaceum_, Wall.; _Fagara\r\npiperita_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kayutana_, Tag.; _Salay_, _Saladay_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The trunk bark is stimulant and is used as a sudorific in the\r\ntreatment of fevers. The fresh bark is quite irritating, for which\r\nreason it is best to use bark taken from the more mature parts of\r\nthe trunk, powdered and desiccated. The dose is 1/2-2 grams 2-3\r\ntimes a day. Its stimulating properties render it useful in colic\r\nand in India it is used as a stomachic and digestive. Is seems also\r\nto possess diuretic properties.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 30-35° high, with trunk thickly set\r\nwith large spines. Leaves odd-pinnate. Leaflets ovate, acute, obtusely\r\nserrate, small transparent vesicles on the surface, spines on the\r\nmidrib and common petiole. Calyx very small, monophyllous. Corolla\r\ntwice as large as the calyx, 4 petals. Stamens 4, inserted on the\r\nreceptacle, the same length as the petals. Ovary superior, 4-angled. No\r\nstyle. Stigmas 2.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Batangas, Morong, Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Murraya exotica_, L. (_M. paniculata_, Jack.; _Connarus foetens_,\r\nand _C. santaloides_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kamuning_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The leaves are stimulant and astringent, and are used\r\nin infusion (15 grams, to water one liter) to treat diarrhea and\r\ndysentery. The root and trunk barks are used for the same treatment\r\nand they as well as the leaves owe their properties to an essential\r\noil and a bitter principle present in all parts of the plant. Vry has\r\ndemonstrated the presence of a glucoside which he has named _murrayin_\r\n(C_18_H_22_O_10_); it crystallizes in small, white needles, is slightly\r\nbitter, soluble in hot water and alcohol, insoluble in ether, slightly\r\nsoluble in cold water. It melts at 170°, and dissolves in alkaline\r\nsolutions coloring them green. Boiled in dilute acids it splits into\r\n_murrayetin_ and glucose. _Murrayetin_ (C_12_H_12_O_10_) crystallizes\r\nin white needles, inodorous, tasteless, slightly soluble in cold water\r\nand in ether, soluble in hot water and alcohol. Heat destroys its\r\ngreen color in solutions; alkalies, in the presence of cold, increase\r\nit. The leaves and the bark of the plant contain an essential oil.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description of this species applies equally well to\r\nthe following species.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree 12° high with leaves alternate,\r\nodd-pinnate. Leaflets lanceolate, almost entire, rigid with small\r\ndots on each surface. Flowers in axillary, very short, compound\r\nracemes. Calyx very small, monophyllous, 5 lanceolate lobules. Corolla\r\nmuch longer than the calyx, 5 lanceolate petals. Stamens 10, joined,\r\nbut not entirely united at the base; 5 alternate stamens longer than\r\nthe others. Anthers sessile, regular. Ovary superior, compressed and\r\nborne on a disc. Style 1, same length as the stamens. Stigma thick,\r\ndepressed, apparently 4-angled. Fruit fleshy, ovoid, acute and somewhat\r\ncurved at the end enclosing a seed with coriaceous, downy testa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Murraya Koenigi_, Spreng. (_Bergera Koenigi_, L.; _Connarus_ sp.,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--(?)\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Leaves alternate, odd-pinnate. Leaflets\r\nobliquely ovate, acute, entire and glabrous. The testa of the seed\r\nbears no down, and may be divided into two parts. The decoction of\r\nthe leaves of this species as well as the former is used to allay\r\ntoothache.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Citrus acida_, F. (_C. notissima_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Limón_, Sp.; _Dayap_, Tag.; _Lemon_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The essence (essential oil) and juice of the fruit are the parts\r\nof the plant used in therapeutics. The essence extracted from the rind\r\nis yellow, fragrant, slightly bitter; density, 0.856; boiling point\r\n165°. The juice which is turbid and pale yellow in color contains 9%\r\ncitric acid, 3-5% gum and sugar and 2-8/10% inorganic salts. The\r\nessence is used to flavor certain pharmaceutical preparations, and\r\nis a diffusible stimulant which may be given internally in doses of\r\n3-6 drops on a little sugar. The bitter rind is occasionally used in\r\ninfusion as a stomachic and stimulant. The juice is most commonly\r\nused in lemonade, a cooling drink which, used intemperately in the\r\nPhilippines, is apt to cause gastro-intestinal trouble, so commonly\r\nattributed to \"irritation,\" but really the result of a general atony\r\nof the digestive organs. Lemon juice is also used with very good\r\nresults as a local cleansing application for sore throat, as well as\r\nexternally on fetid ulcers. In some forms of malarial fever it seems\r\nto have given satisfactory results, administered internally.\r\n\r\nIn many navies lemon juice forms a part of the sea ration as a\r\npreventive of scurvy, upon which it exercises a real and noteworthy\r\naction. The Danish navy adopted it for this purpose in 1770, the\r\nEnglish navy followed, then the French and possibly others. The English\r\ncall it lime-juice, and its preventive dose is 30-40 grams a day. Its\r\ncurative dose is 100-150 grams a day. To preserve the lime-juice it\r\nwas bottled with a layer of oil, which, floating on the surface kept it\r\nfrom contact with the air; but this process gave it a bad taste as did\r\nalso the addition of sulphate of calcium, and at present the English\r\nadd, to each liter of juice, 60 grams of alcohol, which preserves it\r\nperfectly. Fonssagrives says that the antiscorbutic action of lemon\r\njuice is due rather to the vegetable juice itself than to the citric\r\nacid which it contains.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A most familiar tree 11° or more high,\r\ntrunk with solitary thorns. Leaves ovate, obtuse, acute-toothed, the\r\npetiole bearing serrate wings. Calyx 4-6-toothed. Corolla, 4 thick\r\npetals. Filaments 10-25 on the receptacle, some joined and bearing\r\n2-3 anthers. Fruit thin-skinned, globular, about 1' in diameter;\r\nthe rind adheres closely to the pulp.\r\n\r\n(This fruit closely resembles, if it is not identical with the lime\r\nfruit, _C. Limetta_, or _C. Bergamia_, Risso, though Gray states that\r\nthe leaf of the latter has a wingless petiole.--J. B. T.)\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common to all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Citrus Bigaradia_, Hook. f. (_C. vulgaris_, Risso; _C. aurantium_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Naranjas del país_, Sp.; _Kahel_, _Kahil_, Tag.; _Native\r\nOrange_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The rind of the _cagel_ is the so-called bitter orange peel,\r\nthe best of which comes from Curaçao and Barbadoes. It is tonic and is\r\nused in decoction and in syrup. The infusion of the leaves, 5-10 grams\r\nto the liter, is useful as a sedative and diaphoretic in hysterical and\r\nnervous attacks; the infusion of the flowers is similarly used. When\r\ndistilled the flowers yield a very sweet essential oil called _neroli_,\r\nwhich is used as a perfume only.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 15-20° high, trunk bearing solitary\r\nspines. Leaves medium lanceolate, serrate, the apex notched, petioles\r\nwinged. Flowers usually solitary. Calyx 4-5-toothed. Corolla 4-5\r\npetals. Filaments joined or separate. Anthers about 20. The fruit,\r\na small orange 2' or more in diameter, the peel closely adherent.\r\n\r\nThe _C. aurantium verum_ or _C. reticulata_ (Blanco) has a yellow\r\npulp and the rind is readily separated from it, a thin net of fibers\r\nintervening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Citrus decumana_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Suha_, _Lukban_, Tag.; _Toronjas_ Penins.; _Naranjas_,\r\nSp.-Fil.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit, which is handsome and large, and the leaves and\r\nflowers, are used for the same purposes as those of _C. bigaradia_.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--The above species are cultivated in all parts of the islands,\r\nand, like the variety _C. aurantium verum_, H. f. (_C. reticulata_,\r\nBlanco), commonly called _naranjita_, are among the most abundant of\r\nnative fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ægle decandra_, Naves. (_Feronia ternata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Malakabuyaw_, Tag.; _Tabog_, Pam., Tag. (A species of\r\nBael-Fruit Tree.)\r\n\r\nUses.--We do not know the medicinal use of this plant in the\r\nPhilippines. Probably it has none, but we may give those of the\r\nspecies. _R. marmelos_, Cor., the fruit of which is almost identical\r\nwith that of our species and is called _Bela_ or _Bael_ in India. The\r\nfruit of the Malakabuyaw is ovoid and full of a mucilaginous pulp,\r\naromatic and acid, the same as that of the Bael. The uses of the latter\r\nare the following: The pulp acts as an astringent, but it would be\r\nmore correctly called a tonic of the intestinal mucosa, for it has\r\nbeen experimentally proved that, although it checks diarrhoea, it also\r\nacts as a laxative in chronic constipation. In both conditions it seems\r\nto operate by toning and regulating the functions of the intestine.\r\n\r\nMartin, an English physician, was the first to call attention to the\r\nproperties of Bael, and according to Dr. Green one dose of the pulp\r\nof the ripe fruit, prepared with sugar and given every morning, is\r\nan efficient remedy in the treatment of the dyspepsia of Europeans\r\nin India, especially in the form characterized by constipation and\r\nflatulence. The green fruit is a powerful astringent used by the\r\nHindoos for diarrhoea. In cholera epidemics Dr. Bose advises the daily\r\nuse of an ice made from the pulp of the ripe fruit, the object being\r\nthe regulation of the functions of the intestine.\r\n\r\nThe Pharmacopoeia of India contains the following preparations:\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Mixture._--Pulp of the ripe fruit       60 grams.\r\n                    Water                       120 grams.\r\n                    Sugar                        60 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix, and if desired add chopped ice. This forms a very agreeable\r\ndrink which has the aroma of the fruit itself, and may be repeated\r\n2-3 times a day. When the fruit is ripe, this preparation is not only\r\nastringent in cases of diarrhoea, but possesses the additional property\r\nof increasing the appetite.  If the patient's stomach is very weak,\r\nthe preparation may produce vomiting in which event it is necessary\r\nto give it in small doses or to employ the extract.\r\n\r\n_Extract of Bael._--Pulp of the ripe fruit is placed in a vessel and\r\nsufficient water added to cover it. It is then heated and evaporated\r\nto the consistency of a soft extract. The dose is 2-4 grams, 2,\r\n3 or 4 times a day.\r\n\r\n_Fluid Extract of Bael._--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Pulp of Bael          500 grams.\r\n        Water                   3 liters.\r\n        Rectified alcohol      60 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bael is macerated in a third of the water and at the end of 12\r\nhours the liquid is decanted and another third of water is added;\r\nthe maceration is repeated and the same process followed till the\r\nlast third of water is used. Express the residuum, put all the liquid\r\ninto one vessel, filter and evaporate till reduced to 800 grams,\r\nthen cool and add the alcohol. Dose, 4-8 grams.\r\n\r\nThe fluid extract is less active than the freshly prepared solid\r\nextract.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. G. Bidie, the fruit of the _Feronia elephantum_,\r\nCorrea (the species that grows in the Philippines), possesses the\r\nsame properties as Bael. Its leaves are astringent, aromatic and\r\ncarminative, and the gum with which the trunk of the tree is covered\r\nis a good substitute for gum arabic.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 7-8 meters high, the trunk covered with\r\nlarge, solitary spines. Leaves alternate, ternate. Leaflets lanceolate,\r\nscalloped and glabrous, the middle one larger than the others. Calyx\r\n5-toothed. Corolla, 5 thick petals, linear, much longer than the\r\ncalyx. Stamens 10. Ovary cylindrical. Style and stigma thick. Fruit\r\noblong, more than 3' long and 2' thick, with a surface irregular with\r\nprominences and grooves; 10 or more compartments, each containing\r\nseveral ovoid, compressed seeds, ending with a woolly tuft.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--San Mateo, Montalbán (Manila); Arayat (La Pampanga).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feronia elephantum_, Correa. (_Murraya adorata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Panoan_, _Pamunoan_, Vis.; _Wood-apple_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The pulp of the ripe fruit has an agreeable odor and\r\nis edible. In India the green fruit is used as an astringent in\r\ndiarrhoea and dysentery; the ripe fruit is given in diseases of the\r\ngums and as a gargle. Mir Muhammad Husain states that the ripe fruit\r\nis a refrigerant, astringent, cardiac and general tonic, and is very\r\nefficacious in the treatment of salivation and ulcers of the throat,\r\nstrengthening the gums and operating as an astringent. A sorbet made\r\nof the ripe fruit whets the appetite and the pulp is used locally\r\nfor bites of venomous animals. In the latter case the pulverized bark\r\nmay be used if the fruit cannot be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Ferona is a substitute for Bael (_Ægle Marmelos_), and is\r\nused as such by the English physicians in the hospitals of India. The\r\ntender leaves have an agreeable aroma similar to that of anise and\r\nare used internally in decoction as a stomachic and carminative.\r\n\r\nThe incised trunk exudes a gum which is used in India as a substitute\r\nfor gum arabic and there is an active trade in this gum in the bazars\r\nof Bombay and Calcutta. According to Pereira, it was at one time\r\nimported into England from the east of India under the name of gum\r\narabic. It exists in the form of irregular, semitransparent pieces, of\r\na brownish-red color. With water it forms a mucilage as adhesive as gum\r\narabic, and this solution reddens litmus paper. It is dextrogyrous and\r\nis precipitated by the neutral acetate of lead and by caustic baryta.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Tree 3-4 meters high. Leaves fragrant,\r\nopposite, odd-pinnate. Leaflets, 2 pairs, lanceolate, entire,\r\nand glabrous. Common petiole flattened above. Flowers terminal,\r\nwhite, racemose, with 2 flattened peduncles. Calyx inferior, with\r\n5-6 divisions. Corolla, 5-6 petals. Anthers oval. Ovary oblong,\r\n5-lobuled. Style short, caducous. Stigma spindle-shaped. Ovules\r\nnumerous, compressed, in several series. Fruit pulpy, globose, with\r\nwoody rind, one compartment and many compressed, oblong seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Mountains of Angat. Woods of Catugán (Iloilo).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMARUBACEÆ.\r\n\r\nQuassia Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Samadera Indica_, Gaertn.

Vulg.--_Manungal_, Tag., Pam., Bicol.; _Manunagl_, _Linatoganak_,\r\n_Palagarium_, _Daraput_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The wood and seeds contain an intensely bitter principle. The\r\nFilipinos make cups and vases of the wood and allow water to stand\r\nin them 6-12 hours, thus preparing a solution of the bitter principle\r\nof the plant which they use in various stomach disorders.\r\n\r\nVrij has extracted from the seeds a 33% oil of a bright yellow color,\r\ncomposed, according to Oudermans, of 84 parts olein to 16 of palmitin\r\nand stearin.\r\n\r\nThe bitter principle contained in the root, wood and bark was\r\ndiscovered by Blunse who named it _samaderin_; it is a white,\r\ncrystalline, foliaceous substance, more soluble in water than\r\nin alcohol, fusible. Nitric and hydrochloric acids color\r\nit yellow. Sulphuric acid immediately forms a violet red\r\ncolor which disappears as iridescent, feathery crystals are\r\nprecipitated. (D. Beaumentz et Egasse.)\r\n\r\nThe Filipino \"herb-doctors\" concoct an oil of manungal that in reality\r\ncontains none of the ingredients of the seeds; it is simply cocoanut\r\noil in which chips of the wood have been soaked. They use it in doses\r\nof 30-60 grams as a purgative, externally as an application to the\r\nabdomen in colic or indigestion and with friction in rheumatism or\r\ncontusions. In India the oil extracted from the seeds is used locally\r\nwith friction in rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of the wood and the powdered wood are given in fevers,\r\nin dyspepsia and as a general tonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Infusion.--Chips of the wood      20 grams.\r\n                   Water                 500 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nA wineglassful several times a day in cholera, fevers, diarrhoea, etc.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree, trunk straight, the wood\r\nwhite and very light in weight. Leaves 4-5' long, alternate, acute,\r\noval, entire, glabrous, coriaceous, veined. Petioles very short, no\r\nstipules. Flowers in terminal umbels, each composed of 4-6 flowerets\r\nwith moderately long pedicels. Common peduncle, very slender, very\r\nlong, drooping. Calyx of same color as corolla, inferior, very\r\nsmall, 4-lobuled. Corolla purplish, very long, 4 straight, linear\r\npetals. Stamens 8, inserted on the receptacle. Filaments of equal\r\nlength with the petals, with 1-2 appendices at the base. Anthers\r\nspiral. Ovary 5-lobuled, borne on small stalk. One style of equal\r\nlength with the stamens, situated above the center of the 5 lobules\r\nof the ovary which develop into 5 future pods. Stigma simple. Fruit\r\n5 woody pods, short, united centrally above a small base, semi-lunar\r\nin form, medianly expanded, venate, containing a small wrinkled,\r\nkidney-shaped seed attached by a seed-stalk to the superior suture.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common and well known everywhere in the\r\nPhilippines. Blooms in February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURSERACEÆ.\r\n\r\nMyrrh Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Garuga pinnata_, Roxb. (_G. Madagascarensis_, DC.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bugo_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit is slightly acid and edible. The trunk exudes an\r\nabundant gum, of the odor of turpentine, translucent, greenish-yellow,\r\nforming small masses slightly soluble in alcohol, soluble in water,\r\nwith which a mucilage is formed. The juice of the leaves is used\r\nfor asthma. The sap is used in Bombay to remove opacities of the\r\ncornea. There is another species in the Philippines, _G. floribunda_,\r\nDecsne (_Icica Abilo_, Blanco), _abilo_, Tag., the root of which\r\nfurnishes a decoction used for phthisis. This species also produces\r\na gum-resin similar to that of the _bugo_.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, with leaves alternate, odd-pinnate,\r\nwithout stipules, bunched on the ends of the branches, with opposite,\r\nserrate leaflets. Flowers yellowish-white in panicles, compound,\r\npolygamous. Calyx bell-shaped, 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens\r\n10, free, in 2 series. Ovary inferior, 5-lobuled. Fruit, a globose,\r\ngreenish-yellow drupe with numerous bony seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Everywhere in Luzon, Panay and Balabac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canarium commune_, L. (_C. album_ and _C. Luzonicum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Pili_, Tag.; _Java Almond Tree_, _East Indian Elemi_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The ripe pili nut is edible and sold in confectioneries. It\r\nyields a fixed oil, an excellent sample of which was sent by the\r\nManila pharmacist D. A. del Rosario to the Paris Exposition of\r\n1889. \"It is an oil very similar to oil of almond and owing to its\r\nphysical properties may be used as a substitute for the latter for\r\nall the requirements of pharmacy. The only inconvenience connected\r\nwith its use is the slight one that it solidifies at 3° C. It could\r\nfurthermore be very advantageously used in the manufacture of fine\r\ngrades of soap.\" (D. A. del Rosario.)\r\n\r\nThe incised trunk exudes a gum-resin called _brea blanca_ (white\r\npitch) in the Philippines and _elemi_ in Europe. Until recently it\r\nwas not known in Europe what tree yielded the gum elemi, some authors\r\nstating that according to Blanco it was the resin of the _Icica abilo_,\r\nBlanco (_Garuga floribunda_, Decsne); it is not true, however, that\r\nPadre Blanco ever attributed such origin to that product or named his\r\nIcica the \"pitch-tree.\" On the contrary in speaking of the Canarium,\r\nBlanco states that it yields a resin called \"pili-pitch.\" I do not\r\nknow the reason for this confusion of terms, but presume it to be\r\ndue to imperfect knowledge of Spanish on the part of those who thus\r\nquote Blanco.\r\n\r\nPili-pitch, or elemi, as they call it in Manila, is a substance\r\nexisting in soft masses, slightly yellowish or gray, resembling old\r\nhoney in appearance. Its odor is strong and agreeable, somewhat like\r\nthat of lemon and turpentine. Its taste is acrid and bitter.\r\n\r\nThe French pharmacist Meaujean demonstrated in 1820 that elemi contains\r\ntwo resins, one soluble in the cold, and the other in hot spirits of\r\nwine. Other chemists, among them Baup, Flückiger and Hanbury, have\r\nfound elemi to be composed of a resinous substance and a colorless\r\nessential oil; the proportion of the latter Flückiger gives as 10%\r\nand further states that it is dextrogyrous. Sainte-Claire Deville found\r\nthe essential oil levogyrous, a fact that emphasizes the probability of\r\nthere being different products in the market bearing the name of elemi.\r\n\r\nBaup obtained several principles from it: (1) A resin, _brein_,\r\nfusible at 187°, soluble in cold alcohol, crystallizable in oblique\r\nrhombic prisms; (2) another crystalline substance, _bryoidin_, soluble\r\nin 360 parts water at 10°, and melting at 13°; (3) a small amount of\r\n_breidin_, a body soluble in 260 parts water and melting at 100°+;\r\n(4) another resin soluble in boiling alcohol, called _amyrin_.\r\n\r\nWhite pitch is used in the Philippines to make plasters which they\r\napply to the back and breast of patients suffering from bronchial\r\nor pulmonary complaints; it is also applied to indolent ulcers. We\r\nbelieve that elemi possesses the same properties as copaiba, and that\r\nits indications for internal use are the same.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 30-40 meters high, with leaves\r\nalternate, odd-pinnate; leaflets opposite, coriaceous. Flowers\r\nyellowish-white in axillary, compound panicles, hermaphrodite. Calyx\r\n3-toothed. Corolla, 3 oblong, concave petals. Stamens 6, inserted\r\non the base of the disc. Ovary free, of 3 lobules each containing 2\r\novules. Style simple. Stigma, 3 lobules. Drupe oblong, size of large\r\nprune, fleshy, containing a hard, 3-sided pit.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in all Philippine woods especially in Camarines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMELIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nMelia Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Melia Azedarach_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Paraiso_ (_Paradise_), Sp.-Fil.; _Pride of India_,\r\n_China Tree_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root was official in the U. S. P., 1880, as an anthelmintic;\r\nit is administered in the following form:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Fresh root bark      120 grams.\r\n        Water                  1 liter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoil till reduced one half.\r\n\r\nDose.--For a child 1 soup-spoonful every 15 minutes till nausea\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\nIn view of the narcotic effects produced by this drug, the foregoing\r\nmethod of administration seems to us imprudent; we prefer to give 30-70\r\ngrams of the decoction and follow with a purgative such as castor oil.\r\n\r\nThis drug is also tonic, febrifuge and astringent, and a decoction\r\nof its leaves and flowers is used as a wash for ulcers. Some believe\r\nthat the leaves and fruit contain toxic principles, which may well be\r\ntrue considering the effects of large doses of their preparations. It\r\nhas also been observed that the bark collected in March and April may\r\ncause dilatation of the pupil, stupor, etc.; this may be explained\r\nby the fact that at this season the sap is rising in the tree and\r\nthe bark contains an increased amount of active ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe fruit yields a fixed oil, and by fermentation and distillation\r\nproduces alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe root bark referred to is bitter and nauseous, if taken from the\r\nsuperficial roots--the part usually employed; the bark of the deeper\r\nparts is astringent by virtue of the contained tannin.\r\n\r\nJacobs analyzed the bark and isolated an amorphous resin of yellowish\r\ncolor and very bitter taste. It is soluble in alcohol, ether and\r\nchloroform, slightly soluble in sulphuret of carbon, insoluble in\r\nturpentine or benzin. He believes that it is the active principle of\r\nthe root, and produces the anthelmintic action already mentioned:\r\nthe proper dose is 0.20 centigrams to a child of 4 years, followed\r\nby a purge of calomel.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 30-40° high, with leaves alternate,\r\ncompound, odd-pinnate; leaflets opposite, ovate, pointed,\r\ndentate. Flowers in large axillary compound panicles. Calyx,\r\n5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals, rose-colored within, lilac-colored\r\nwithout. Stamens 10, united into a cylindrical tube, expanded at both\r\nends, the mouth 15-toothed. Anthers inserted near the apex of the\r\ntube, short, fleshy, bilocular. Ovary free, of 5 biovuled cells. Style\r\nof equal length with the tube. Stigma button-shaped. Fruit a drupe,\r\nabout the size of a small olive, yellow when ripe, with a dark brown\r\npit of 5 one-seeded cells.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Native of China; is cultivated in most gardens in the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dysoxylum Blancoi_, Vidal. (_D. salutare_, F. Villar; _Turroca\r\nvirens_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Igiw_, _Agiw_, _Taliatan_, Tag.; _Ananangtang_, _Bakugan_,\r\n_Makasili_, Vis.; _Malabangaw_, Pam.; _Basiloag_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--The bark of the trunk, dry and finely powdered, is used in\r\ndoses of 1 1/2-2 1/2 grams as an emetic, and, according to Padre\r\nBlanco, its effect is very certain.\r\n\r\nIt is also a febrifuge, and Padre Mercado states that it cures \"all\r\nforms of asthma, suffocative affections of the chest, and griping\r\npains of the belly.\" He also states that it yields marvelous results\r\nin malarial fevers, given during the cold stage in doses of 4-8\r\ngrams in water or wine in which it has macerated 12 hours. He also\r\nrecommends its use before breakfast as an anthelmintic in lumbricoids,\r\nand finally attributes to it virtues as an emmenagogue.\r\n\r\nPadre Blanco calls attention to the species _D. schizochitoides_,\r\nTurcz. (_Turroea octandra_, Blanco), _Himamaw_, Tag., as a substitute\r\nfor _D. Blancoi_.\r\n\r\nThe Tagalo \"herb-doctors\" pretend that the part of the bark near the\r\nearth is doubly efficacious, for which reason they administer only\r\nthat portion which is within one meter of the ground, giving it in\r\nthe doses already mentioned.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Tree 16-20 meters high. Leaves\r\nglabrous, odd-pinnate, petioles very long; leaflets entire,\r\nopposite, short-petiolate, acute, oblique at the base. Flowers in\r\naxillary panicles. Calyx, 5 imbricated sepals. Corolla, 5 linear,\r\nlanceolate petals united at the base. Staminal tube, 10-toothed and\r\n10-anthered. Ovary 5-celled, each cell containing two ovules. Style\r\nsomewhat longer than the stamens. Stigma thick and depressed. Seed\r\nvessel globose, depressed, somewhat downy, 5-angled; with 5\r\ncompartments each containing 2 seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Batangas and Laguna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sandoricum Indicum_, Cav.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Santol_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The santol is doubtless one of the best known fruits in\r\nManila. The most savory portion is the center, which consists of seeds\r\ncovered with a white pulp of a delicious flavor in the ripe fruit\r\nof good quality. The fleshy covering is edible only in the center\r\nof the fruit and only a very thin layer of that, the rest having\r\nvery little flavor. The whole fruit is used in making a confection\r\noften prescribed as an astringent. Padre Mercado compares it very\r\nappropriately to the quince. The root of the santol is aromatic,\r\nstomachic and astringent, by virtue of which latter property it is\r\nused in Java in the treatment of leucorrhoea.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 30-40° high, well known in the\r\nislands. Leaves ternate; leaflets 4-5' long, half-ovate, obtuse,\r\nentire, stiff and downy, the middle one elliptical. Flowers in\r\npanicles. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla much longer than the calyx, 5\r\ngreenish petals, linear and curved downwards. Nectary a cylindrical\r\ntube attached to the corolla for half its length, mouth 10-toothed,\r\ncontaining 10 sessile anthers. Style somewhat longer than the\r\nstamens. Stigma 5-parted. Fruit about size and form of a small apple,\r\nthick, brown, pericarp indehiscent, 5 or more one-seeded compartments.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows in all parts of the islands, commonly along the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carapa Moluccensis_, Lam. (_Xylocarpus granatum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tabigi_, _Nigi_, _Kalumpang sa lati_, Tag.; _Migi_, Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--The seeds contain a yellow oil, bitter and astringent, with a\r\ncharacteristic odor, having a taste somewhat resembling the odor. In\r\ndecoction they are used for diarrhoea and dysentery, on account,\r\ndoubtless, of the tannin they contain. The dose is 1-2 seeds dried,\r\npounded and infused with 200 grams of sweetened water.\r\n\r\nThe bark, also bitter, is said to be useful in fevers.\r\n\r\nIn America they extract an oil from the species of the _C. Guianensis_,\r\nAubl., with which the negroes anoint themselves to keep away stinging\r\ninsects. Wood soaked in this oil is also proof against insects.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--This tree, 20° high, grows in swampy\r\ndistricts. Leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate. Two pairs of wedge-shaped\r\nleaflets, entire and glabrous. Petiole very short. Calyx inferior,\r\n4-5-toothed. Corolla, 4-5 concave petals, slightly notched at the\r\nend. Nectary notched, ovate, 8-9-toothed. No filaments. Anthers\r\nequal in number to the teeth of the nectary and inserted between\r\nthem. Ovary very thick, globose. Stigma shield-shaped. Drupe globose,\r\nresembling a very large orange, 5 chambers, each containing 1, 2 or\r\nmore seeds, convex on one side and concave on the other, angular and\r\nmuch crowded. Testa hard and porous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common throughout the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cedrela Toona_, Roxb. (_C. odorata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kalantas_, Tag., Pam.; _Lanigpa_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The infusion of the flowers is antispasmodic. The trunk bark\r\nis an excellent astringent, and Dr. Waitz recommends it in extract\r\nas a treatment for infantile diarrhoea, for which I also have found\r\nit very useful. Blume says that it contains marked antispasmodic\r\nvirtues, and Dr. G. Kennedy confirms it. Other physicians of India,\r\namong them Ros and Newton, have recommended the bark as a substitute\r\nfor cinchona, given dry in doses of 30 grams.\r\n\r\nInfusion.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Bark dry, pounded           30 grams.\r\n        Water                      150 grams.\r\n\r\nFilter and add:\r\n\r\n        Syrup of cinnamon           20 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nDose.--Several dessert-spoonfuls a day.\r\n\r\nThe powdered bark is very useful as an application to indolent ulcers\r\nwhich it instantly deodorizes; like powdered quinine it is used in\r\nthe treatment of superficial gangrene.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large tree. Leaves odd-pinnate. Leaflets\r\noval, lanceolate, acuminate, entire, glabrous, 5-6 pairs. Flowers\r\nyellow, in terminal panicles. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 oblong\r\npetals. Stamens 5, free, inserted on the apex of a disk. Ovaries\r\nsessile, 5 many-ovuled cells. Style short. Stigma on a disk. Seed\r\nvessel coriaceous, 5 compartments, septicidal, 5-valved. Seeds\r\ncompressed, pendulous, prolonged in a membranous wing.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELASTRACEÆ.\r\n\r\nStaff-Tree Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Celastrus paniculata_, Willd. (_C. alnifolia_, DC.; _C. Rothiana_,\r\nRoem.; _Diosma serrata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bilogo_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--I am not acquainted with the medicinal uses of this plant\r\nin the Philippines. In India, by means of a primitive system of\r\ndistillation, they extract from the seeds a dark-colored oil of\r\nempyreumatic odor, which under the name of Oleum nigrum was once\r\nproclaimed by Dr. Herklots as the sovereign remedy for beriberi.\r\n\r\nThis oil in doses of 10-15 drops a day is a very powerful stimulant,\r\nthe action of which is manifested by profuse perspiration several\r\nhours after its administration. Malcolmson reports that it has\r\ngiven him good results in several cases of beriberi, particularly\r\nin recent cases and those in which nervous and paralytic symptoms\r\npredominated. In Concan, the juice of the leaves is given in doses\r\nof 30 grams as an antidote for opium. The bruised seeds made into a\r\npaste with cow urine are used locally in treatment of itch. They are\r\nalso used in the treatment of leprosy, gout, rheumatism, and other\r\ndiseases which according to their medical theories, are derived from\r\n\"cold humors.\" For these purposes they give the seeds internally,\r\nbeginning with one and increasing daily until 50 are taken. At the\r\nsame time they make external applications of the oil or of another\r\ncompound prepared in the following way:\r\n\r\nPlace in an open pot with one opening, seeds of _C. paniculata_,\r\ncloves, benzoin, nutmeg and mace. The pot having been previously\r\nheated, is covered with another, inverted over the opening. On the\r\nsides of the latter a thick black oil condenses which Herklots very\r\nappropriately named _Oleum nigrum_.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A climbing shrub, 6-9° high, without\r\nspines. Leaves 6-7' long by 5' broad, alternate, petiolate,\r\nentire, glabrous, half-ovate. Flowers small and paniculate. Calyx, 5\r\ndivisions. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 5, inserted in a disc. Anthers\r\noblong. Ovary 3-celled. Stigma 3-lobulate. Style short. Seed vessel\r\nthe size of a pea, globose, 3-celled, loculicidal, with pulpy seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Tayabas, Laguna, Ilocos North, San Mateo, Albay. Flowers\r\nin April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRHAMNACEÆ.\r\n\r\nBuckthorn Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zizyphus Jujuba, Lam._ (_Rhamnus Jujuba_, L. & Blanco;\r\n_Z. Mauritania_, Wall.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Manzanitas_, Sp.-Fil.; _Jujube Fruit_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The small fruit known commonly as _manzanitas_ has an agreeable\r\ntaste, although ordinarily offered for sale before they are quite\r\nripe. They are among the most popular dainties at the fairs and\r\nfestivals in the provinces of Manila and are the only part of the plant\r\nused in medicine. They possess emollient qualities and are official\r\nin the codex. They enter in the composition of the so-called pectoral\r\nremedies (composed of equal parts of figs, dates, Corinthian raisins\r\nand manzanitas).\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub, with hooked thorns, leaves alternate,\r\npetiolate, coriaceous, entire, 3-nerved, 2 thorny stipules, one\r\nof them crooked. Flowers small, greenish, axillary. Calyx, 5 oval\r\ndivisions. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 5, free. Ovary bilocular,\r\nsituated on the disc. Styles 2-3, divergent; small papillary\r\nstigmas. Drupe pulpy, globose, resembling a crab-apple in size and\r\ntaste, enclosing a hard, 2-celled seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rhamnus Wightii_, W. & Arn. (_Ceanothus Wightiana_, Wall.;\r\n_R. Carolianus_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kabatiti_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The dried trunk bark is the part employed in medicine. Hooper\r\nanalyzed it in 1888 and found a crystalline principle (0.47%), a\r\nbrown resin (0.85), a red resin (1.15), a bitter principle (1.23),\r\nsugar, starch, calcium, oxalate, etc.\r\n\r\nAs the active principles exist in the resins, an alcoholic tincture\r\nof the latter is the best preparation for administration. In India\r\nit is used as a tonic and an astringent.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree that grows near the sea\r\ncoast. Trunk 9-12° high, straight, many-branched, devoid of\r\nthorns. Leaves alternate, ovate, acutely serrate, glabrous,\r\nshort-petioled. Flowers greenish-white, axillary, perfect. Calyx\r\n5-toothed, inversely conical. Corolla, 5 petals, smaller than the\r\nteeth of the calyx, oval, without claws, notched at the apex. Disc\r\nfleshy, smooth, slightly concave. Stamens 5, hidden within\r\nthe petals. Filaments flattened. Anthers rounded. Ovary fleshy,\r\ninserted at the bottom of the calyx tube. Style short. Stigmas 3,\r\ndivergent. Fruit oval, its base adherent to the calyx, 3 seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Batangas. Blooms in July and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANACARDIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nCashew Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mangifera Indica_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Manga._\r\n\r\nUses.--The dried and pulverized kernel of the seed is used as an\r\nanthelmintic in doses of 1 1/2-2 grams both in India and Brazil. The\r\nsame preparation is used in the Philippines in the treatment of\r\ndysentery and diarrhoea and its effect is doubtless due to the large\r\nquantity of tannin it contains. It is administered as follows: The\r\npounded kernels of 20-25 seeds are brought to a boil in 2 bottles\r\n(sic) of water. When the liquid has evaporated a third, it is\r\nremoved from the fire, cooled, decanted, and again placed on the\r\nfire after adding three to four hundred grams of sugar. This time\r\nit is allowed to boil till reduced to one bottle. The dose is 50-60\r\ngrams 2-3 times a day. Incisions in the trunk exude a brownish resin\r\nwhich solidifies in the air, is slightly acrid, bitter, dissolves in\r\nalcohol and partially in water. In Malabar it is given internally\r\nin the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, mixing it with white\r\nof egg and opium. But the curative value of the combination is more\r\nlikely due to the albumen and opium than to the resin. Dissolved in\r\nlemon juice it is a useful application in the itch. The trunk bark\r\nis astringent and is employed in decoction as a wash for ulcers and\r\neczema and as an injection in leucorrhoea.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is one of the most highly prized in the Philippines, and\r\nresident Europeans are able to eat large quantities of it without ill\r\neffects unless the fruit is over-ripe, in which case it often causes\r\ntransient diarrhoea, which should be treated with a mild purge.\r\n\r\nIn Mauritius the following compound powder is used in dysentery:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Dried slices of manga fruit             30 grams.\r\n        Dried manga kernels                     60 grams.\r\n        Plantain seeds                          15 grams.\r\n        Dried ginger                             8 grams.\r\n        Gum arabic                              15 grams.\r\n        Pulverize each ingredient separately;\r\n        add powdered candy sugar                30 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix.\r\n\r\nDose.--For an adult one dessert-spoonful every 4 hours; may be given\r\nin cauge or arrowroot.\r\n\r\nThe flowers, testa and bark are, in Hindoo therapeutics, considered\r\n\"cold,\" and \"astringent,\" and are used especially in diarrhoea. In\r\ncertain throat affections the Hindoos employ the burning leaves for\r\ninhalation. They also use the gum made by evaporating the juice of\r\nthe ripe fruit, as a confection and an antiscorbutic. Dr. Linguist\r\nrecommends the bark as a local astringent in uterine, intestinal and\r\npulmonary hemorrhage and employs the following:\r\n\r\n_Fluid Extract_.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Fluid extract of manga bark         10 grams.\r\n        Water                              120 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix. Dose, 1 teaspoonful every 1 or 2 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A noble tree, 30° to 40° high, dome-like\r\nor rotund in outline. Leaves dark green, lustrous, alternate,\r\nlanceolate, entire; short petioles. Flowers racemose, in verticillate\r\npanicles. Calyx, 4, 5 or 6 sepals. Corolla white, fragrant, 4, 5 or\r\n6 petals. Stamens 5, of which perhaps 1, 2 or 3 are fertile. Style on\r\none side of the ovary. Stigma simple. Fruit large, reniform, fleshy,\r\nyellow when ripe; contains a large, flattened, reniform pit. Blooms\r\nfrom January even till June. The natives force the fruit by building\r\nfires under the trees when but little air is stirring.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common throughout the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anacardium occidentale_, L. (_Cassuvium reniforme_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kasuy_, Tag.; _Caskew Nut_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The pericarp of the nut contains an essential oil which is very\r\nirritant and used by the Hindoos as a vesicant; it severely blisters\r\nthe lips and tongues of imprudent persons who break the nut without\r\ntaking the precaution of cleansing it of the oil before opening it. In\r\naddition to the oil called _cardol_, the pericarp contains an especial\r\nacid _anacardic_, a little tannin and ammonia. Cardol (C_21_H_31_O_2_)\r\nis an oleaginous, yellow liquid very unstable, neutral, soluble\r\nin alcohol and ether, insoluble in water, volatile, and vesicant if\r\napplied to the skin. \"Anacardic\" acid is white, crystalline, odorless,\r\nwith a burning, aromatic taste. It melts at 26° and decomposes at 200°\r\nforming a colorless oil; it is not vesicant, burns with a dark flame,\r\nand has the odor of rancid oil. A tincture of the pericarp has been\r\nmade (1 part to 10 of alcohol) and given internally as a vermifuge\r\nin doses of 2-10 drops. Cardol, according to some authors, does not\r\nexercise a vesicant action in the gastro-intestinal canal, because it\r\nis not dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices; I am sure, however,\r\nthat I have seen a choleraic diarrhoea brought on by swallowing,\r\nin fun, the pericarp of one nut and a half. Cardol is eliminated by\r\nthe urine.\r\n\r\nThe kernel is edible and has a very agreeable taste when roasted. By\r\nexpression it yields a sweet, yellowish oil, density 0.916.\r\n\r\nThe trunk exudes a gum resin in masses varying in color from red\r\nto yellow.\r\n\r\nThe fleshy part, called the fruit, is edible but contains a certain\r\nquantity of cardol not only evidenced by the odor but by the\r\nsmarting of the mouth and throat after eating. It is very juicy and\r\nthe expressed liquid is fermented in Bombay and distilled to make a\r\nvery weak alcohol which sells for the very low price of 4 annas (5\r\ncents gold) a gallon. This alcohol is again distilled and a stronger\r\nobtained which sells for 1 1/2 rupees a gallon. The Portuguese of\r\nIndia make a sort of wine from the fermented juice of the fruit,\r\nwhich, like the weak alcohol we have mentioned, is a well-known\r\ndiuretic and is used as a liniment.\r\n\r\nThe gum resin of the trunk contains 90% of anacardic acid and 10%\r\ncardol. Wood soaked in it is preserved from the ravages of insects,\r\nespecially of white ants, for which purpose it is used by bookbinders\r\nalso. Therapeutically it is used externally in leprosy, old ulcers\r\nand to destroy corns, but on account of its rubefacient and vesicant\r\nqualities it is necessary to use it cautiously.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 18° high, with leaves cuneiform,\r\nglabrous, stiff, short-petioled. Flowers polygamous in terminal\r\npanicles. Calyx with 5 erect segments, imbricated, caducous. Corolla,\r\n5 linear, lanceolate petals, curved and imbricated. Stamens 8-10,\r\nall fertile. Filaments united to one another and to the disc. Ovary\r\nheart-shaped. Style filiform and eccentric. Stigma defective. Ovule\r\nsolitary. Fruit a reniform nut enclosed in a pulpy pyriform body,\r\nformed by the matured disc and extremity of the peduncle. Seed\r\nreniform, testa membranous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common throughout the Archipelago. Blooms in February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Odina Wodier_, Roxb.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Amugis_, Tag. and Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The bark is very astringent and in decoction is used for\r\nchronic ulcers. In India Dr. Kirkpatrick has used it as a lotion in\r\nimpetigo. It has also given good results as a gargle in affections\r\nof the pharynx and buccal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe trunk exudes a gum called in India \"kanni ki gond,\" an article\r\nof commerce. It is almost odorless and has a disagreeable taste. It\r\nis only partially soluble in water, forming a viscid mucilage. It is\r\nused in the treatment of contusions and sprains and is edible when\r\nmixed with cocoanut milk.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, with leaves bunched at the extremities\r\nof the branches, oblong, oval, acuminate, odd-pinnate, 3-4 pairs of\r\nopposite leaflets. Flowers greenish-white, polygamous, in terminal\r\npanicles. Calyx gamosepalous, 4 rounded lobules. Corolla, 4 imbricated\r\npetals. Stamens 8, free. Ovary 4-parted. Pistillate flowers; ovary\r\nsessile, oblong, unilocular. Style 4-parted, thick. Drupe oblong,\r\ncompressed, unicellular. Testa hard, with 1 non-albuminous kernel.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--San Mateo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORINGEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Moringa pterygosperma_, Gaertn.

Vulg.--_Malungay_, _Kamalungay_, _Kalungay_, Tag.; _Dool_,\r\n_Malungit_, Vis. and Pam.; _Horse Radish Tree_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root is vesicant and the Filipinos bruise it and use it for\r\nsinapisms. I have often observed, however, that it is quite painful\r\nused in this way. Dr. Waitz states that it is a good plan to add a few\r\ndrops of the root juice to mustard sinapisms, a proceeding which seems\r\nto me superfluous, especially in the case of children as he advises it.\r\n\r\nThe Bengal pharmacopoeia contains the following official preparations:\r\n\r\n_Compound Spirit_.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Small pieces of moringa root    }\r\n        Orange peel                     }   aa 600 grams.\r\n        Nutmeg                                  20 grams.\r\n        Spirit of wine                           4 1/2 liters.\r\n        Water                                    1 liter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix and distil 4 liters.\r\n\r\nDose.--8-30 cc. as a stimulant and diuretic.\r\n\r\n_Compound Infusion_.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Moringa root, small pieces, bruised }\r\n        Mustard seed                        }   aa 30 grams.\r\n        Boiling water                              1/2 liter.\r\n        Let stand 2 hours, filter and add\r\n        compound spirit.                           30 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nDose.--30-60 grams a day, as a strong stimulant.\r\n\r\nThe expressed seeds yield a fixed oil, which is irritating and in my\r\nopinion should not be used internally.\r\n\r\nThe green pods, the flowers and the tender shoots of the leaves are\r\neaten stewed. The juice of the leaves is given internally in India,\r\nas an emetic, in doses of 30 grams.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A well-known tree, 5-6 meters high. Leaves\r\n3-pinnate, their terminal divisions odd-pinnate. Leaflets oval,\r\nglabrous, entire. Calyx, 5 unequal petaloid segments, imbricated,\r\ncaducous. Corolla white, 5 unequal petals. Stamens inserted on the\r\nborder of a disc, unequal, 5 opposite the petals bearing anthers,\r\n5 alternate without anthers. Anthers dorsal, unilocular. Ovary\r\npedunculate, lanceolate, unilocular, with many ovules in 2 series,\r\ninserted on the parietal placentæ. Fruit a pod terminating in a beak,\r\n3-valved. Seeds numerous, very large, winged, embedded in a spongy\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common throughout the islands. Blooms in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGUMINOSÆ.

They and the leaves are purgative\r\nand are given in decoction for this purpose, 30-40 grams to 200 of\r\nwater. The juice of the flowers is a popular remedy in India, for\r\nmigraine and coryza. The trunk bark is bitter and tonic.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 4-6 meters high, with drooping\r\nlimbs; leaves long, very narrow, abruptly pinnate; many caducous\r\nleaflets, linear, elliptical. Flowers large, white, fragrant, in\r\naxillary racemes. Calyx bell-shaped with two indistinct lips. Corolla\r\npapilionaceous, white. Standard oval, a slight notch at the apex. Wings\r\nalmost as large as the keel which is strongly arched. Stamens 10,\r\ndiadelphous. Anthers uniform. Style and stamens equally long. Stigma\r\na small head. Pod 1-2° long, linear, 4-sided, containing many oval\r\nseeds, separated by filamentous partitions.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows in all sections of Luzon and Panay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abrus precatorius_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Saga_, _Sagamamin_, _Bangati_, Tag.; _Bangati Gikosgikos_,\r\nVis.; _Kanaasaga_, Pam.; _Bugayon_, Iloc.; _Jequiriti_, _Prayerbeads_,\r\nEng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The part of the plant most important in therapeutics is the\r\nseed, the size of a small pea, bright red with a black spot, hard and\r\nshining. The Filipino children use them to make rosaries and other\r\ndecorations. In the distant past the Filipinos used these seeds to\r\nweigh gold, a practice followed even to-day by the Hindoos. The famous\r\nSusrutas, author of the \"Ayur Veda,\" recommends them internally for\r\nnervous diseases; modern therapeutics, however, limits their use\r\nto one disease, though that is frequent and stubborn enough, namely\r\nchronic granular conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nSome physicians state that these seeds are poisonous and others the\r\ncontrary, but the fact that they are used as food among the poor\r\nclasses of Egypt, demonstrates their harmlessness in the digestive\r\ntract at least; when introduced into the circulation they undoubtedly\r\nexercise a toxic effect. We have already mentioned that their use\r\nis limited nowadays to the therapeutics of the eye; the decoction of\r\nthe seeds known in Europe under the name of \"Jaqueriti\"--so named in\r\nBrazil--produces a purulent inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva and\r\nit is precisely this counter-irritant effect which makes it useful in\r\nchronic granular conjunctivitis, the persistence of which has defied\r\nthe most heroic measures of therapeutics. The French oculist, Dr. de\r\nWecker, was the first to employ jequirity for this purpose, in the\r\nform of a 24 hours' maceration of the seeds, 10 grams to 500 grams of\r\nwater. It is necessary to use a product recently prepared and with\r\nthis several applications a day are made. It is now known that the\r\ninflammation of the healthy conjunctiva is not caused by germ-life\r\ncontained in the solution but by an inorganic ferment discovered\r\nby Bruylans and Venneman and named jequiritin; they state that it\r\nis produced during the germination of the seeds or of the cells in\r\nthe powdered seeds. Warden and Waddell, of Calcutta, have isolated\r\nan essential oil, an acid named \"ábric\" and an amorphous substance\r\ncalled abrin, obtained by precipitation with alcohol from a watery\r\ninfusion of the pulverized seeds. Its action is identical with that of\r\n\"jequiritin.\"\r\n\r\nThe infusion appears to possess considerable value as a stimulating\r\napplication to indolent ulcers.\r\n\r\nThe root is a good substitute for licorice, is emollient and has an\r\nagreeable taste. The extract is useful in catarrhal diseases of the\r\nbronchi and in dysuria. The leaves contain the same properties as\r\nthe root and an extract prepared from them is used as a substitute\r\nfor licorice.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A vine, with leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate,\r\na stylet taking the place of the terminal leaflet. Leaflets linear,\r\nentire, glabrous, tipped with a small point. Common petiole with\r\n2 awl-shaped stipules at the base. Flowers in small racemes. Calyx\r\ngamosepalous, caducous, 4-5 short teeth. Corolla papilionaceous, wings\r\nhorizontal. Stamens 9, monadelphous with bilocular anthers. Style\r\nvery short. Stigma globose. Pod 4-5 cm. long, truncate at the ends,\r\nwith 5-6 red seeds, each with a black spot.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all mountainous regions of the islands. Grows\r\nnear houses and roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mucuna pruriens_, DC. (_M. prurita_, Hook.; _M. utilis_, Wall.;\r\n_Dolichos pruriens_, L.; _Carpopogon pruriens_, Roxb.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Nipay_, _Lipay_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The pods are official as an anthelmintic in the Pharmacopoeia\r\nof India. They are used in the form of an electuary triturated to the\r\nproper consistency with honey or syrup. The dose for adults is one\r\nsoupspoonful, and for children a teaspoonful, given every morning\r\nfor 3-4 consecutive days. The last day a purge is given to expel\r\nthe lumbricoids.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A vine with ternate leaves. Flowers red,\r\nkeel larger than the standard and wings. Pods about as thick as the\r\nlittle finger, lacking transverse grooves, curved in the form of the\r\nletter f, covered with bright red down, which causes an unendurable\r\nitching. They are divided into 3 or 4 oblique cells each containing\r\na brown, shiny seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon and Panay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Erythrina Indica_, Lam. (_E. corallodendron_, L.; _E. carnea_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Dapdap_, _Kasindik_, Tag.; _Dapdap_, _Kabrab_, Vis.;\r\n_Dapdap_, _Sulbang_, Pam.; _Indian Coral Tree_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This tree is well known on account of the beauty of its\r\ncrimson flowers. The decoction of the leaves is a useful cleansing\r\nand deodorizing application for ulcers. The bruised leaves are used\r\nlocally in painful affections of the joints and to abort syphilitic\r\nbuboes and abscesses of all kinds. The juice of the tender leaves\r\nis used in Concan to destroy maggots in ulcers, and the powder has\r\na similar use. A decoction is used locally in ophthalmia.\r\n\r\nThe root and the leaves are used as a febrifuge in the Philippines and\r\nin India, according to Wight. In Brazil the bark is given in small\r\nrepeated doses as a hypnotic and in the Philippines as a diuretic\r\nand purgative; a decoction of the leaves is similarly used. The\r\nbark contains an alkaloid discovered by Rochefontaine and Rey, called\r\n_erythrin_, which acts upon the central nervous system, diminishing its\r\nnormal functions even to the point of abolishment, without modifying\r\nmotor excitability or muscular contractility. W. Young isolated\r\na glucoside, _migarrhin_, similar to saponin, but possessing the\r\nadditional property of dilating the pupil.\r\n\r\nIn bronchitis with dyspnoea the following infusion of bark is very\r\nuseful:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Fresh bark,                 }\r\n        Freshly bruised leaves,     } aa  2 grams.\r\n        Water                         1,500 grams.\r\n\r\nBoil till reduced one-half, filter and add:\r\n\r\n        Simple syrup                    200 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nDose: Wineglassful every two hours.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large tree, 20° high, thorny, with ternate\r\nleaves. Leaflets rhomboid, broad, entire, glabrous. Secondary petioles:\r\nthat of the middle leaflet long, bearing 2 glands, those of the others\r\nshort, bearing 1 gland each. The leaves fall at the end of the rainy\r\nseason and the flowers bloom. They are a handsome scarlet color,\r\nlarge, in terminal racemes. Calyx half-cylindrical, oblique, truncate,\r\nentire. Corolla papilionaceous; standard elongated, lanceolate. Wings\r\nshort. Keel very short, 2-lobuled. Stamens diadelphous. Anthers\r\nlarge. Ovary woolly. Stigma thick. Pod curved, rounded, furrowed in\r\nparts corresponding to the seeds which are numerous, oval, pointed\r\nat the ends.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common throughout the islands. Blooms in February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitoria ternatea,_ L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kolokanting_, _Pakingang_, Tag.; _Kolokating_, Vis.;\r\n_Butterfly-pea_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The pounded seeds mixed with oil are used locally for painful\r\njoints. They possess purgative and emetic properties and Dr. J. Shartt\r\nhas employed a mixture of the powdered roasted seeds, 8 grams, with\r\ndouble the quantity of acid tartrate of potassium. Its action is\r\ngentle, but sure. The alcoholic extract of the root, a soft, brown,\r\nresinous substance with an odor recalling that of jalap, is a very\r\nactive cathartic, producing sharp effects in doses of 30-60 centigrams;\r\nin fact it produces such severe tenesmus that its use in such doses\r\nshould not be recommended.\r\n\r\nThe root bark is used internally in an infusion (4-8 grams to 1 liter\r\nof water) as an emollient in irritability of the bladder and urethra\r\nand has been recommended for such a purpose by Mooden Sheriff. It\r\nis a diuretic which frequently acts as a purgative, a fact that\r\nis not surprising in view of the above-mentioned properties of the\r\nalcoholic extract.\r\n\r\nThe roasted seeds used as a purgative are so trustworthy that they\r\ndeserve the further attention of physicians.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A vine very well known by its blue\r\nflowers. Leaves alternate with 3 pairs of oval leaflets. Stipules\r\npersistent. Flowers axillary, solitary, 1-1 1/2' in long\r\ndiameter. Calyx in 5 acute divisions, the two upper ones\r\nsmaller. Corolla papilionaceous. Standard open, notched at the\r\nend. Keel shorter than the wings and covered by them. Stamens 10,\r\n9 united and 1 free. Stigma downy, thick. Pod full of short hairs,\r\nwith more than 6 surrounded with a tow-like substance, reniform,\r\nwith black spots.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common along the roads and in gardens. Flowers in July\r\nand November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_1. Pterocarpus santalinus_, L. [5]\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Narra_, _Naga_, Tag.; _Apalit_, _Daytanag_, Pam.; _Red\r\nSaunders_ or _Red Sandalwood Tree_, Eng.\r\n\r\n_2. P. Indicus,_ Willd. (_P. pallidus_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Asana_, Tag.; _Naga_, Vis.\r\n\r\n_3. P. erinaceus_, Poir. (_P. echinatus_, Pers. & DC.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Asana_, _Narra_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The wood of the first is the so-called \"red sandalwood.\" It\r\nis used for building purposes and, in medicine, as an astringent. In\r\ndecoction it is used as a gargle for sore throat. The second is\r\nalso an excellent building material and is used medicinally for its\r\nastringent properties. A decoction of sufficient strength to color\r\nthe water a light blue is used as a mouth wash in toothache and has\r\nsome reputation as a solvent of vesical calculi. All three species\r\nyield a resin known in pharmacy under the name of \"kino.\" The true\r\ngum kino is really produced by the _P. marsupium_, Roxb., but the\r\nPhilippine product, especially that of the second and third species,\r\nhas for a long time been exported to Europe under the name of \"red\r\nastringent gum\" or \"kino.\" This name is given to the sap of these\r\ntrees dried without the aid of artificial heat. The bark is the part\r\nwhich produces it and the following extractive process is employed in\r\nMadras: a vertical incision is made in the trunk and lateral incisions\r\nperpendicular to it and a receptacle is placed at the foot of the\r\ntree. This soon fills and when the gum is sufficiently dried by air\r\nand sun it is packed in boxes and exported.\r\n\r\nIn respect to appearance, solubility and chemical composition,\r\nFlückiger and Hanbury were unable to discover any difference between\r\nthe kino of _P. marsupium_, Roxb., and that of _P. erinaceus_, Poir. It\r\nis therefore interesting to consider a product that is identical with\r\nthat described in the pharmacopoeias as produced by the _P. marsupium_,\r\nRoxb., though the latter does not grow in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nKino is at present used but little in therapeutics and its action is\r\nanalogous to that of tannin and catechu. It is given internally for\r\nits astringent effect in chronic diarrhoea, leucorrhoea, blenorrhoea\r\nand hemorrhages. The dose of the powder is 1-4 grams, and of the\r\nalcoholic tincture, containing 20 parts kino to 100 of alcohol,\r\n5-10 grams. In prolapse of the rectum and anal fissure the following\r\nsolution is used by enema:\r\n\r\n\r\n                Kino            3 grams.\r\n                Water         500 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor vaginal injections a solution of 20 to 250 water.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The \"pterocarpus,\" L., is a tree of\r\nthe first order with odd-pinnate leaves. Leaflets alternate and\r\ncoriaceous. Flowers yellow, in racemes, with caducous bracts and\r\nbractlets. Calyx turbinate, with short teeth. Petals exserted,\r\nmarkedly unguiculate. Standard and wings curled. Keel obtuse with\r\nits petals slightly or not at all coherent. The staminal tube,\r\ncleft above and below or above only. Stamens superior, often almost,\r\nand at times entirely, free. Anthers versatile. Ovary pedunculate,\r\nwith 2 ovules. Style curved. Stigma terminal. Pod orbicular, smooth or\r\nspiny, usually containing one seed, encircled by a broad, rigid wing,\r\nthe point curved downward.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In the mountains of Luzon, Panay and Mindoro. Blooms\r\nin March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pongamia glabra_, Vent. (_Robinia mitis_, L.; _Gadelupa maculata_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Balikbalik_, Tag.; _Butong_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The oil expressed from the seeds is used in India for lighting\r\npurposes, and in addition is of notable therapeutic value. It is an\r\nexcellent local remedy for the itch, for herpes and especially for\r\npityriasis versicolor, used alone or emulsified with lemon juice. In\r\nstubborn cases Dymock recommends the addition of oil of _hydrocarpus_,\r\ncamphor and powdered sulphur. Dr. Gibson states that he knows of\r\nno plant in the vegetable kingdom possessing more notable curative\r\nproperties in itch, herpes and other cutaneous diseases than the\r\nplant under consideration. It is also used as an embrocation in\r\narticular rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThe powdered leaves mixed with common salt and pepper are given\r\ninternally with a little milk, as a remedy for leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the root makes a useful wash for gangrenous ulcers and\r\na good injection for fistula.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 18° high, with leaves opposite,\r\nodd-pinnate. Leaflets in 3 pairs, ovate, lanceolate, entire,\r\nglabrous and membranaceous. Flowers slightly spotted, racemose. Calyx\r\nbell-shaped, with 5 scarcely visible toothlets. Corolla papilionaceous,\r\npetals equal, clawed. Standard with 2 callosities athwart the\r\nbase. Stamens 10, diadelphous. Pod with one seed, which is flat,\r\nsmooth, veined, bright red.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon and Panay. Blooms in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGUMINOSÆ.\r\n\r\nBrasiletto Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cæsalpinia Bonducella_, Flem. (_Guilandina Bonducella_, L.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bayag-Kambing_, _Kalambibit_, Tag.; _Dalugdug_, Vis.;\r\n_Fever Nut_, _Physic Nut_, _Bonduc Seeds_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The seed is the part of the plant employed and is official in\r\nthe Pharmacopoeia of India. It is used as a tonic and antiperiodic\r\nin intermittent fevers and in general where tonic treatment is\r\nindicated. It has given good results in the malarial fevers of India,\r\naccording to English physicians. The Pharmacopoeia of India contains\r\nthe following preparation under the name of \"Compound Powder of Bonduc\"\r\n(Pulvis bonducellæ compositus).\r\n\r\n\r\n        Seeds of Bonduc, powdered     30 grams.\r\n        Pepper                        30 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix and keep in a well-corked flask.\r\n\r\nDose.--1-2 grams 3 times a day.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines the powdered seed is given in affections of the\r\ndigestive tract, especially in diarrhoea and feeble digestion. The same\r\nname of Bonduc is given to the seeds of another species that grows in\r\nthe Philippines, _C. Bonduc_, Roxb.; _Kamot-Kabag_, _Bayan-Kambing_,\r\nTag. The seeds are identical in chemical composition and therapeutic\r\nindication.\r\n\r\nThe two principal substances contained in the seeds are an oil, 24%\r\nand a resin, 1.88%. The former is straw-colored and slightly bitter\r\nby virtue of the presence of a resin that may be precipitated by\r\nalcohol. The resin or bitter principle exists as an amorphous powder,\r\nwhite, bitter, not acrid, soluble in chloroform, alcohol, acetone,\r\ncrystallizable acetic acid, fixed and essential oils; slightly soluble\r\nin ether and bisulphide of carbon, insoluble in water and petroleum\r\nether. The alkalies do not affect it. It melts at 140°, decomposing and\r\nleaving only a carbon. Its discoverers, Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen,\r\nhave given it the name _bonducin_ (C_14_H_15_O_5_). Hydrochloric acid\r\ncolors it red; sulphuric acid, a maranthin red in half an hour.\r\n\r\nBonducin seems to be the active principle of the seeds and is given\r\ninternally in doses of 10-20 centigrams; according to Dr. Isnard,\r\nof Marseilles, this dose has given as good results in fevers as the\r\nsame quantity of quinine.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub with prostrate stem bristling with\r\nthorns. Leaves twice abruptly pinnate, a thorn taking the place\r\nof the terminal leaflet. Leaflets in 10-14 pairs, ovate, expanded,\r\nwith a spine at the apex. Common petioles thorny, with 4 leaf-like\r\nstipules at the base. Flowers yellow, in racemes. Calyx 5-parted,\r\ncurved downward. Corolla inserted on the calyx, 5 petals, 4 nearly\r\nequal, the uppermost broader and shorter. Stamens 10. Filaments\r\nvery unequal in height, inserted on the calyx, united and woolly\r\nat the base. Pistil very short. Stigma thick. Pod rhomboidal before\r\nmaturity, prickly, containing 2 semi-globose seeds with testa hard,\r\nmottled and tough.\r\n\r\nThe other species, _C. Bonduc_, Roxb., is distinguished by leaflets\r\nunequal at the base, by the absence of stipules, and by the bright\r\norange yellow seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon, Panay and Joló. Blooms in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cæsalpinia Sappan_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sibukao_, _Sapag_, Tag.; _Palo del Brasil_, Sp.; _Sappan\r\nWood_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The decoction of Sibukao is given in hemorrhages, especially\r\nof the lungs. It is probably the red color of this decoction which\r\noriginated the idea of giving it to check bleeding, and this is the\r\npractice of the native Filipino doctors, as well as of the Arabs\r\nand Hindoos. The natives of Cochin China, reasoning in an opposite\r\nmanner, prescribe it as emmenagogue. Some authors recommend Sibukao\r\nas a substitute for logwood. The decoction is administered in chronic\r\ndiarrhoea, especially that of children. A few cases of phlebitis have\r\nbeen reported as occasioned by its use. The extract is made as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Sibukao in small pieces      500 grams.\r\n        Boiling water                  4 1/2 liters.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacerate for 24 hours, boil until reduced by half, filter and evaporate\r\nthe filtrate to a syrupy consistency. Do not use iron vessels.\r\n\r\nSibukao contains much tannin and gallic acid, and a peculiar substance\r\nwhich distinguishes it from logwood, _brasilin_ (C_22_H_20_O_7_),\r\nwhich gives a red color to alkaline solutions instead of blue or\r\npurple. It is a crystalline pigment which may be considered a compound\r\nof hematoxylon and fenol.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A very common tree, 12-15° high, with spiny\r\ntrunk, leaves twice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets linear, notched at\r\nthe apex. Flowers racemose. Calyx boat-shaped. Corolla, 5 petals,\r\nthe uppermost broad, short, spotted red. Stigma bifid. Pod sabre-like,\r\nwoody, with 3-4 seeds separated by partitions. The wood is well known\r\neverywhere in the Philippines, being a very important article of\r\ncommerce, and there is no fear of logwood being substituted for it,\r\nas the latter is more expensive, and substitutions are not ordinarily\r\nmade under such circumstances. In commerce it occurs in large pieces of\r\nall shapes and forms, since the branches and trunks are cut into pieces\r\nwhich vary from 1/2-2 meters in length. Its color is reddish-yellow\r\nor white with more or less red grain. Blooms in September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cæsalpinia pulcherrima_, Swartz. (_Poinciana pulcherrima_, L. &\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Flores y Rosas Caballero_, _Caballero_, Sp.-Fil.;\r\n_Barbadoes Flower-Fence_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The leaves are emmenagogue, purgative like those of senna,\r\nand excitant. The bark especially is a powerful emmenagogue, used in\r\nsome countries for criminal purposes. The decoction of the flowers is\r\npectoral and febrifuge and is given in bronchitis, asthma and malarial\r\nfever. The flowers contain a bitter principle. The roots are acrid\r\nand poisonous. The seeds of the green fruit are eaten frequently by\r\nchildren; when ripe they contain gallic and tannic acids, by virtue\r\nof which they are used in tanning hides and to dye yellow combined\r\nwith alum, and black combined with salts of iron. They also contain\r\na pigment and a resin.\r\n\r\nInfusion of the Flowers.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Flowers of the caballero, dry          20 grams.\r\n        Water                                 500 grams.\r\n        Sugar                                  70 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix. Dose, a wineglassful several times a day.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub, with prickly trunk. Leaves\r\ntwice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets 5-8 pairs, glabrous, ovate and\r\nelliptical, bearing a spine at the extremity, 3 stipules to each\r\npair of leaflets. Flowers yellow and red, in racemes on the ends\r\nof the branches. Calyx divided almost to the base, with 5 concave\r\nparts. Corolla, 5 petals 1' long with short claws, one petal very small\r\nand straight, the others larger, with wavy edges. Stamens 10, crimson,\r\n3' long, free, woolly, united at the lower end. Pistil the same length\r\nas the stamens. Stigma somewhat concave. Ovary sessile, unilocular,\r\nmany-ovuled. Pod compressed, with 7 or more seeds inserted on the\r\nsuperior suture and separated from each other by fleshy divisions.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in gardens where it is cultivated for its\r\nbeautiful flowers. Blooms throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cassia fistula_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Cañafistula_, Sp.; _Lombayong_, _Ibabaw_, _Baloyong_,\r\nVis.; _Purging Cassia_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The pod known in pharmacy under the name of \"Cañafistula\"\r\ncontains a blackish, sweet pulp, which is a mild purgative if combined\r\nwith carminatives, but it produces severe colic if given alone. The\r\nurine sometimes takes on a dark color after taking it. The laxative\r\ndose is 4-8 grams, the purgative 30-60.\r\n\r\nExtract of Cassia.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Pulp and seeds of ripe pods       1 kilo.\r\n        Water                             1 liter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter mixing the pulp with water the liquid is strained through a\r\nwoolen cloth; the material which remains in the strainer is washed\r\nwith a little more cold water which is added to the other liquid and\r\nthe two are evaporated to the consistency of the extract.\r\n\r\nDose.--15-30 grams.\r\n\r\nDr. Irving states that the root is a very energetic purgative. In\r\nConcan the juice of the tender leaves is used in the treatment of\r\nimpetigo.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree with trunk about as thick as the\r\nhuman body, with leaves opposite and abruptly pinnate. Leaflets,\r\nthe lower ones smaller, 5 pairs, ovate, lanceolate, glabrous\r\nand rather tough. Common petiole, cleft at the base, lacking\r\nglandule. Flowers bright yellow, in long, pendulous racemes. Calyx,\r\n5 ovate sepals. Corolla, 5 unequal petals. Stamens 10, free, 3\r\nlonger than the rest. Ovary unilocular, many-ovuled. Pod cylindrical,\r\npointed at the end, woody, black, 1-2° long, with many circular seeds,\r\nsurrounded by a blackish pulp and separated by partitions.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon and Panay. Blooms in March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cassia occidentalis_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tighiman_, _Balotangaso_, Tag.; _Tambalisa_, Vis.;\r\n_Western Senna_, _Styptic Weed_, Eng.; _Negro Coffee_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--In Brazil they use an infusion of the root as a tonic and\r\ndiuretic, 4 grams of the root bark and 180 of boiling water to be taken\r\nin one day. In Dahomey the leaves are used as a febrifuge. Thirty\r\ngrams of fresh leaves are boiled in 300 grams of water till the\r\nliquid is reduced to 250 grams. The patient takes this decoction\r\nhot the first day of the fever and a profuse perspiration promptly\r\nbreaks out. As a rule the effect is immediate and the fever does not\r\nrecur. This treatment of fevers is more common in that country than\r\nthat by quinine and they claim that it has the advantage over the\r\nlatter of acting as a stomachic tonic. By adding a small quantity\r\nof the roots to the decoction it is rendered diuretic. The seeds\r\npossess the same properties and are used in decoctions of 30 grams\r\nto 300 of water. According to De Lanesan the roasted seeds are used\r\nin La Réunion in infusion similar to coffee in the treatment of\r\ngastralgia and asthma. In some countries they mix them with coffee\r\njust as chicory is used in Europe.\r\n\r\nHeckel and Schlagdenhauffen have made a very complete study of the\r\nplant and we quote the following from their works:\r\n\r\nChemical composition of the seeds.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Water                                           8.850\r\n        Fats and pigments soluble in petroleum ether    1.600\r\n        Fats and pigments soluble in chloroform         1.150\r\n        Odorous material and traces of tannin           5.022\r\n        Glucose                                         0.738\r\n        Gummy, mucilaginous and pectic matter          15.734\r\n        Soluble albuminoids and aleuron                 6.536\r\n        Cellulose                                       7.434\r\n        Insoluble albuminose                            2.216\r\n        Lignose                                        32.727\r\n        Fixed salts                                    17.976\r\n        Lost material                                    .017\r\n                                                      -------\r\n                                                      100.000\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the studies of the above authors the seeds had been\r\ntherapeutically tested by Delioux de Savignac and Professor\r\nClouet. Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen have confirmed the febrifuge\r\nvirtues of the seeds and are uncertain as to the active principle\r\nsince they found no glucoside or alkaloid in their analysis. The\r\nantiperiodic properties are comparable with those of quinine and have\r\neven proved effective in some cases in which quinine failed. It seems\r\nquite clear that the tannin is the active principle which is the\r\nmore probable because its anti-periodic virtues are now recognized\r\nby all therapeutists.\r\n\r\nIt is given in maceration or infusion, 2-15 grams of the seeds to 3\r\nor 400 of water to be taken several times a day. The treatment causes\r\nno very marked physiological effects. It seems to act as a sedative\r\nto the nervous system.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--An annual plant, .60-1 meter high. Root\r\ncentral with lateral rootlets. Stem straight, ramose. Leaves opposite,\r\nabruptly pinnate with a stylet in place of the odd leaflet. Leaflets,\r\n5-6 pairs, the lower ones smaller, ovate, oblong, margins and lower\r\nface downy. Common petiole swollen at the base, 2 stipules and 1\r\nglandule. Calyx, 5 unequal sepals. Corolla, 5 nearly equal petals,\r\nsulphur yellow, concave, the posterior one further developed. Two\r\nverticils of 5 stamens each. Of the 5 stamens superior to the sepals,\r\n2 are fertile, larger and arched; of the other 5 stamens 4 are fertile\r\nand small. Pod compressed, linear, smooth, 5' long, containing many\r\ncompressed, heart-shaped seeds, separated by thin partitions.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon. Blooms in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cassia alata_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Acapulco_, Sp.-Fil.; _Katandá_, _Gamut sa Buni_,\r\n_Sonting_, Tag.; _Sunting, Kansitás_, Vis.; _Pakayomkom-kastila_, Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--This is one of the most popular Philippine remedies and its\r\nusefulness is vouched for by many physicians practicing in many\r\ndifferent lands. Its antiherpetic properties are notable and the\r\nTagalo name of the plant, \"Gamut sa Buni,\" means literally \"medicine\r\nfor herpes.\" The natives use the juice of the leaf applied locally\r\nto the affected part. These properties have long been familiar to\r\nthe Malays and to the Hindoos who in their medical works give the\r\nplant the Sanscrit name of \"Dadrughna,\" meaning \"to cure herpes.\" The\r\nPharmacopoeia of Bengal recommends cassia in the form of an ointment\r\nmade by mixing the crushed tender leaves with simple ointment. This\r\npreparation is, in our opinion, undesirable on account of its liability\r\nto become rancid and vaseline should be the excipient used. Another\r\napplication for herpetic eruptions is the juice of the leaves mixed\r\nwith an equal quantity of lemon juice. The Malays use the leaves dried\r\nin the sun, adding to them a little water and rubbing them briskly\r\non the affected parts, the vigorous treatment being an important part\r\nof the cure.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of the leaves is a laxative and according to Mr. J. Wood\r\nthe tincture has an action similar to that of senna. Dr. Pulney Andy\r\nof India states that the extract prepared from the tender leaves is\r\na good substitute for extract of colocynth.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Porte claims to have obtained the best results with an acetic\r\nextract of the fresh leaves. The following is his formula:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Fresh leaves of _C. alata_          100 grams.\r\n        Acetic acid diluted in 2/3 water    450 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacerate 10 or 12 days, filter and express, then filter again and\r\nevaporate to the consistency of an extract.\r\n\r\nThe seeds contain vermifuge principles.\r\n\r\nThe activity of this plant in herpes is due to the chrysophanic acid\r\ncontained in it. The more recent the eruption the more certain is\r\nthe effect.\r\n\r\nThe following species, all of which grow in the Philippines, contain\r\nprinciples analogous to those of the _C. alata_, viz.: _C. sophera_,\r\nL. and _C. tora_, L., called in Tagalo _manimanihan_.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub, 7-9° high, with a straight, ramose\r\ntrunk 3-4' in diameter. Leaves 1 1/2-2° long, opposite, abruptly\r\npinnate, a thick stylet taking the place of the odd leaflet. Leaflets\r\n10-13 pairs, the smaller ones 1-2' long. Common petiole with 2\r\nhorizontal stipules at the base. Flowers in conspicuous, erect\r\nracemes. Calyx, 5 free concave, unequal sepals. Corolla, 5 petals of\r\na beautiful yellow color. Stamens perigynous, 10 in number, 3 upper\r\nones very small and frequently sterile, 3 lower very large. The\r\nbilocular anthers open by 2 pores. Ovary many-ovuled with filiform\r\nstyle. Pod long with 2 prominent wings on the sides and many seeds\r\nwhich slightly resemble a cross with blunt ends.\r\n\r\nThe _C. sophera_, L., is characterized by 10 stamens, all fertile\r\nand a smooth, linear, bivalved pod full of seeds separated by false\r\npartitions. The _C. tora_, L., bears a quadrangular pod about 15\r\ncentimeters long by 2 in diameter.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows in all parts of the islands and is universally known\r\nby the natives. Blooms in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tamarindus Indica_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tamarindo_, Sp.; _Sampalok_, Tag., Pam., Bik.; _Sambak_,\r\n_Sumalagi_, _Kamalagi_, Vis.; _Tamarind_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The pulp of the fruit is used to make a sort of sweet preserve\r\nand is very popular among the Filipinos. They prepare a refreshing\r\ndrink from the pulp mixed with sweetened water and believing it to\r\nbe beneficial to the liver, stomach and blood, they use too much\r\nof it. Its excessive use is rather prejudicial to the health, but\r\ngiven in moderation it is very efficient in allaying the thirst of\r\nfever patients. The pulp contains weak laxative properties and it\r\nis customary to administer it in solution with cream of tartar. Its\r\nchemical composition is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                Citric acid             9.40\r\n                Tartaric acid           1.55\r\n                Malic acid              0.45\r\n                Potassium bitartrate    3.25\r\n                Sugar                  12.50\r\n                Gum                     4.70\r\n                Vegetable gelatin       6.25\r\n                Parenchyma             34.35\r\n                Water                  27.55\r\n\r\n                                            (Vauquelin.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of any sickness, especially after labor, the first bath\r\ngiven to the convalescent is with a decoction of the leaves of the\r\n\"sampaloc,\" to prevent convulsions, the native herb-doctors say.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large tree, somewhat resembling the elm in\r\ncontour, with leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate. Leaflets 12 or more\r\npairs, linear, with a notch at the apex, entire, glabrous. Flowers\r\nyellow-white, spattered dark red, racemose. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla,\r\n5 lanceolate petals with crispate borders. Stamens monadelphous,\r\ndividing into 7 filaments above. The ripe pod is chocolate color,\r\noblong, slightly compressed, straight or curved, 6-15 centimeters\r\nlong, full of a light-brown pulp in which rest the seeds enveloped in\r\na cellular membrane. These seeds are flattened, almost quadrangular;\r\ntesta hard, of a chestnut color, shiny and without albumen.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common everywhere in the islands. Blooms in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bauhinia malabarica_, Roxb. (_B. tomentosa_, Wall. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Alibangbang_, Tag., Vis., Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--The leaves of this tree and of the species _B. tomentosa_,\r\nL., are quite acid and the Filipinos use them as an ingredient of\r\nmany dishes. The fresh flowers possess anti-dysenteric virtues for\r\nwhich purpose they are given internally in infusion of 10-20 grams\r\nof the flowers to one-half liter of water. The decoction of the root\r\nbark is a common remedy for liver troubles along the coast of Malabar\r\naccording to Rheede.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 20° high, with leaves alternate,\r\npeltate, slightly cordate, orbicular, the apex divided into two large\r\nlobules with a stylet between them, glabrous above, somewhat downy\r\nbeneath; 2 large, flat glandules are situated at the base. Petioles\r\nshort. Flowers cymose. Peduncle long. Calyx inferior, funnelform,\r\nwith 4-5 sepals as long as the corolla. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens\r\n10, 5 alternate ones longer than the others. Stigma thick, peltate,\r\n2 lobules. Pod 1° long, with linear stalk, containing many seeds\r\nseparated by filamentous isthmuses.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common everywhere. Blooms in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGUMINOSÆ.\r\n\r\nMimosa Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entada scandens_, Benth. (_E. Pursoetha_, DC. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Gogo_, Tag.; _Bayogo_, _Balogo_, _Gohong bakay_, Vis. and\r\nPam.; _Gilla Nuts_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The use made of the mashed bark of this tree is well known\r\nthroughout the Philippines. Cut in strips and beaten thoroughly between\r\nstones it is sold under the name of \"gogo\"; it is macerated in water,\r\nto which it imparts a reddish color, and forms a substitute for\r\nsoap. The Filipinos use this preparation for bathing, especially\r\nthe hair, for which purpose there is no more useful or simple\r\npreparation. It cures pityriasis, and renders the hair very soft,\r\nwithout drying it too much as is usually the case with soap. The\r\nnatives use it in treating the itch, washing the affected parts with\r\nthe maceration and at the same time briskly rubbing them with the\r\nbark; in this way they remove the crusts that shield the acari. The\r\ntreatment is successful in direct proportion to the energy of rubbing.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of \"gogo\" are very large, lenticular, flattened, 3-4\r\ncentimeters in diameter. Their chemical composition has been studied by\r\nPettit. Alcohol dissolves the active principle, perhaps a glucoside,\r\nthe study of which the author has not completed. Five centigrams of\r\nthis substance administered to a guinea-pig causes paralysis of the\r\nhind quarters without any apparent inflammation. He also found saponin\r\nin the seeds, but it exists in much greater quantity in the trunk. In\r\nthe Sunda Islands they eat the seeds roasted and also extract from\r\nthem an illuminating oil.\r\n\r\nThe maceration of gogo is emetic and purgative; it is used in the\r\ntreatment of asthma; it is exceedingly irritating, the slightest\r\nquantity that enters the eye causing severe smarting and a slight\r\nconjunctivitis for one or two days.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A high climbing shrub with stem as much as\r\n7-8' in diameter. Leaves opposite, twice abruptly pinnate, a stylet\r\nreplacing the terminal leaflet; 5 pairs of elliptical leaflets, entire,\r\nglabrous and notched at the apex. Common petiole with 2 stipules\r\nat the base. Flowers in delicate spikes. Calyx obliquely truncate,\r\n5-toothed. Corolla, 5 oval petals much larger than the calyx. Stamens\r\n10-13. Filaments longer than the corolla. Anther with 1-2 white,\r\nglobose glandules. Pod woody, 4-6° long by \"4 fingers\" broad, with\r\nlarge notches on the borders, many compartments containing many large,\r\ncompressed, circular seeds with dark-colored testa, 3-4 centimeters\r\nin diameter.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Mountains of Luzon and Panay. Blooms in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parkia Roxburghii_, G. Don. (_P. brunonis_, Grah.; _P. biglobosa_,\r\nBenth.; _Mimosa peregrina_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kopang_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit is edible. Its pulp is golden yellow with a sweetish\r\ntaste and an odor like that of violets.\r\n\r\nThe roasted seeds are used in certain parts of Africa to make\r\nan infusion like coffee, for which reason they have been called\r\n\"Soudan Coffee.\"\r\n\r\nThe pulp was analyzed by Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen in 1887;\r\nit contains 60% of its weight of sugar (a mixture of dextrose and\r\nlevulose), 0.98% of free tartaric and citric acids, fats, albuminoids,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large tree of the first order. Leaves\r\nopposite, twice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets small, linear, more\r\nthan 40 pairs. Principal petiole with one glandule at the base\r\nand often another higher up. Calyx long, tubular, with 5 unequal\r\nlobules. Corolla, 5 equal petals. Stamens 10, monadelphous. Ovary\r\nfree, unilocular, multi-ovulate. Pod, 1° × 1', woody, much compressed,\r\nbrown, with many seeds embedded in a yellow pulp.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Abounds in the provinces of central Luzon. Blooms in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acacia Farnesiana_, Willd. (_A. Indica_, Desv.; _Mimosa Farnesiana_,\r\nL. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--Aroma, Sp.; Cassie Flower, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The trunk bark is astringent and in decoction is of use in the\r\ntreatment of prolapsed rectum and as an injection for leucorrhoea. A\r\npoultice of the tender leaves is applied to ulcers and sores previously\r\nwashed with the decoction.\r\n\r\nThe tree exudes an abundant gum very similar to gum arabic which\r\nlatter is the product of another species of acacia (_A. Arabica_,\r\nWilld.). The Manila pharmacist, D. Anacleto del Rosario, sent to\r\nthe Paris Exposition of 1899 a specimen of this gum obtained on the\r\nplantation of D. P. P. Roxas, in Batangas. This specimen differed in\r\nno respect from gum arabic and it will surely sooner or later take\r\nthe place of the latter in the Philippines, both for pharmaceutical\r\nand industrial purposes. It would be superfluous to describe here\r\nthe properties of gum arabic.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree 9-12° high, very well known, trunk\r\nbristling with long thorns. Leaves twice abruptly pinnate. One or more\r\npairs of leaflets, very small, linear. Common petiole with two thorns\r\nunited at its base and a small glandule on the upper part. Flowers\r\nyellow, aromatic, axillary, joined in a globose head 1/2-3/4' in\r\ndiameter, consisting of more than 50 minute flowerets. In each axil\r\nare 2 peduncles. In some heads all the flowerets are staminate, in\r\nothers hermaphrodite. The hermaphrodite flowers have a calyx with\r\n5 small teeth. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 40 or more. Pistil same\r\nlength as the stamens. Staminate flowers: calyx, corolla, stamens\r\nand anthers as in the hermaphrodite flowers. Pistil none. Pod round,\r\ncurved, with 8 or more elliptical, compressed seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows everywhere, but forms dense thickets in the provinces\r\nof La Laguna and Batangas. Blooms in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRASSULACEÆ.\r\n\r\nOrpine Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kalanchoe laciniata_, DC. (_Cotyledon laciniata_, Roxb.; _Bryophyllum\r\nserratum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Siempreviva_ (_Live-for-ever_), Sp.-Fil.; _Katakataka_,\r\nTag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fleshy leaves are beaten up and applied to chronic ulcers\r\nand sores on which they exert a stimulant action. Applied to the\r\ntemples they relieve headache. Ainslie testifies to the good effect\r\nof its local use in inflammations and as a wash for ulcers. The juice\r\nof the leaves is used in Concan in the treatment of bilious diarrhoea\r\nand gall stones.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A well-known plant, about 2° high, with leaves\r\nsessile, opposite, oval, serrately toothed, fleshy. Flowers yellow,\r\nin umbels, the stalks reaching a height of 3°. Calyx very short,\r\nwith 4 lanceolate, acuminate sepals, united at the base. Corolla\r\nsalver-shaped, persistent, with border having 4 small lobules. Stamens\r\n8, fertile. Ovaries 4, free, each with 1 many-ovuled cell. Styles\r\nsame length as the stamens. Stigmas awl-shaped. Four seed vessels,\r\neach with 1 compartment containing many oblong seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBRETACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Terminalia Catappa_, L. (_T. molucana_, Lam.; _T. mauriciana_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Talisay_, Tag.; _Almendro_, Sp.-Fil.; _Talisay_,\r\n_Banilak_, _Nato_, _Hitam_, Vis.; _Kalisay_, Pam.; _Lugo_, _Pandan_,\r\nIloc.; _Indian Almond_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The kernel is edible and has a very agreeable taste. It yields\r\nabout 50% of a fixed oil, sweet and savory. If left for some time,\r\nit deposits an abundance of stearin. It closely resembles oil of sweet\r\nalmonds for which it, as well as the oil of Pili (_Canarium commune_,\r\nL.), which we have already described, makes a good substitute.\r\n\r\nThe trunk bark is astringent and in decoction is used for atonic\r\ndiarrhoea and as a lotion for ulcers.\r\n\r\nDecoction.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Bark (ground and pounded)    12 grams.\r\n        Water                       150 grams.\r\n        Simple syrup                 40 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be given by the tablespoonful in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 6-8 m. high. Branches horizontal\r\nand radiating from the trunk. Leaves purplish, bunched, cleft at\r\nthe base, sometimes transversely ovate, sometimes oval, notched,\r\nglabrous. Petiole very short. Flowers axillary, racemose, with a scale\r\nat the base of the peduncle, some hermaphrodite and others lacking\r\npistils. Staminate flowers: calyx downy within, with 5 lobes. Corolla\r\nwanting. Stamens 10, inserted on the calyx. Hermaphrodite flowers:\r\npistil same length as stamens. Drupe, fleshy, inferior, oval with\r\nthe borders turned upward containing a very hard and fibrous nut;\r\nseed long and sharp-pointed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon. In Manila it is cultivated extensively as\r\nan ornamental tree, especially along the Sabana Walk, General Solano\r\nAve. and in Sampaloc and Malacañan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Terminalia Chebula_, Retz. (_T. reticulata_, Toth.; _Bucida cuminata_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Dinglas_, _Diglas_, Tag.; _Black Myrobalan Tree_,\r\nIndo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The ripe fruit, called _myrobalans_ in India, is purgative\r\nand six of them pounded up and given in decoction operate with\r\ncertainty, producing 4 or 5 copious evacuations without nausea or\r\nother disagreeable symptoms. Dr. Waring has experimented with them\r\nand recommends them highly. The taste may be made more agreeable\r\nby adding a little cinnamon to the decoction. Dymock states that\r\nthree fruits are sufficient, and Dr. Hove gives one as the effective\r\ndose. This lack of agreement may be explained by the fact that the\r\nfruits are of different sizes, and probably Waring refers to those\r\nof medium size. Contrary to what one would imagine, judging from\r\nits purgative action, the fruit contains astringent principles, and\r\nmakes an effective injection for leucorrhoea as a substitute for nut\r\ngalls. It is also of some merit in the treatment of piles.\r\n\r\nThe green fruit is highly esteemed by Radja Kalikesen as a carminative,\r\ntonic and purgative. Dr. Twining also mentions these same properties,\r\nrecommends it as a tonic and aperient of great benefit in atony of\r\nthe digestive organs and expresses surprise that the Europeans make\r\nno use of it. According to the same author a dose in the treatment\r\nof diarrhoea and dysentery is 4 grams twice a day. He quotes a case\r\nof hypertrophy of the spleen which he cured with this fruit.\r\n\r\nSome of the leaves bear horn-shaped galls, flattened, narrow and\r\nhollow. They are caused by an insect which stings the leaves and\r\ndeposits its eggs in them. These leaves with galls are astringent and\r\nvery useful and effective in dysentery and diarrhoea, especially that\r\nof children. The dose for a child of more than one year is 0.40 to 0.50\r\ngram a day, administered in fractional doses every two or three hours.\r\n\r\nFridolin has obtained from its fruit an acid, which he calls\r\n_chebulinic_ (C_28_H_25_O_10_) and presumes to be a mixture of tannic\r\nand gallic acids. As Stenhouse had formerly indicated, no principle has\r\nbeen discovered to which the purgative properties can be attributed,\r\nunless it be a green oleo-resin turned red by nitric acid, obtained\r\nfrom the fruit by Apery.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree of the second order, with leaves\r\n3' long, alternate, lanceolate, entire and glabrous. Petioles\r\nshort. Flowers terminal, in spiked panicles. Calyx superior,\r\nbell-shaped, colored, downy within, 5-toothed. Corolla wanting. Stamens\r\n10, longer than the calyx. Anthers roundish. Ovary cylindrical. Style\r\ncurved and longer than the stamens. Stigma simple. Fruit ovoid, 2-4\r\ncentimeters long, 5-10 acute angles, wrinkled, with blackish, hard,\r\ncompact mesocarp; contains 1 seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Batangas, San Mateo. Blooms in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quisqualis Indica_, L. (_Q. villosa_, Roxb.; _Q. spinosa_, Nares.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tagaraw_, _Niogniogan_, Tag.; _Tangolon_, Vis.;\r\n_Babebabe_, Pam.; _Tartaraw_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit contains a kernel that tastes much like cacao, for\r\nwhich reason the Tagalogs call it \"niogniogan\" (like cacao). This\r\nkernel is a powerful anthelmintic, used also in India, the dose for\r\na child of 4 years being 2-4, pulverized and mixed with a little\r\nmolasses or sugar. A large dose produces hiccough, a fact well known\r\nto the natives. Dr. Bouton states that they may cause convulsions\r\nand other similar nervous disorders.\r\n\r\nThey yield a light green, fixed oil, probably the active principle\r\nof the plant.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A climbing shrub, 6-9° high, whose stem is\r\nthickly set with long, opposite thorns. Leaves in stars of 3, oblong,\r\nacute, entire, glabrous. Petioles very short. Flowers white, veined\r\nwith red, in axillary spikes. Calyx very long, nearly cylindrical,\r\n5-toothed. Corolla, 5 petals, inserted between the teeth of the\r\ncalyx. Stamens 10, inserted on the calyx-tube, shorter than the\r\ncorolla, arranged in 2 series, 5 higher than the rest. Style the same\r\nlength as the stamens, united throughout nearly its entire length\r\nwith the wall of the calyx-tube from which it separates near the\r\nstigma. Stigma rather bulky. Fruit 1' long, ovoid, 5 sharp ridges\r\nin the woody, fragile, mahogany-colored pericarp, which contains a\r\npointed kernel at one end.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--San Mateo, and along the shores of Luzon. Blooms in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRTACEÆ.\r\n\r\nMyrtle Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psidium pomiferum_, L. (_P. aromaticum_ and _P. pyriferum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Guayabas_, Sp.; _Bayabas_, _Guayabas_, _Tayabas_, Tag.,\r\nand other dialects; _Guava_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The green fruit is acid and very astringent. The stage of\r\ndevelopment when it is best eaten raw, is just before it ripens, for\r\nthen its acidity has lessened, it is not astringent and does not emit\r\nthe strong odor, so disagreeable to many, that characterizes the ripe\r\nfruit. When fully ripe it is sweet, non-astringent and very bland,\r\nand this is the stage when it is best for making the jellies and\r\npreserves so popular in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe bark, especially that of the root, is highly astringent\r\nand a decoction of it is used for diarrhoea and as a wash for\r\nulcers. Dr. Waitz has successfully used the following formula in\r\ntreating the chronic diarrhoea of children:\r\n\r\n\r\n            Root bark of guava      15 grams.\r\n            Water                  180 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoil till reduced one half. Dose, a tablespoonful every 2 or 3 hours\r\naccording to age.\r\n\r\nA decoction of the shoots is very useful in stomatitis, cutaneous\r\neruptions and ulcers. Dr. Waitz advises his formula in prolapsus\r\nrecti of children. It is also of value as an injection in diarrhoea\r\nand dysentery.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, about 10° high, branches square and\r\nsomewhat winged towards the ends. Leaves opposite, oblong, obtuse,\r\ndowny, aromatic in odor. Petiole very short. Flowers axillary,\r\nsolitary, white and fragrant. Calyx adherent, the border breaking in 3,\r\n4 or more unequal parts when the flower expands. Corolla, 5-6 petals,\r\ninserted on the calyx, curved downward. Stamens numerous, inserted\r\nin the calyx, as long as the corolla. Style same length as stamens,\r\nawl-shaped. Fruit somewhat pear-shaped, with 4 or 5 ribs that disappear\r\nat maturity, 4 or more cells each with many small, hard, irregular\r\nseeds. In the Philippines the fruit grows to the size of a small pear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eugenia Jambolana_, Lam. (_Calyptranthes Jambolana_, Willd. and\r\nBlanco; _Syzygium Jambolanum_, DC. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Lomboy_, _Duhat_, _Duat_, Tag., Pam., Vis.; _Jambul_\r\nor _Black Plum_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The ripe fruit, so dark a purple in color that it seems black,\r\nis edible and very popular in the Philippines, though not considered\r\nchoice. Some suppose it to be harmful, but it is in reality very easy\r\nof digestion.\r\n\r\nThe syrup of the fruit juice, and the decoction of the trunk bark\r\nare both very efficacious in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery.\r\n\r\nSyrup of Jambul.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Juice of ripe fruit             500 grams.\r\n        White sugar                     950 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nDissolve in a covered water-bath, strain through woolen cloth and\r\nput aside.\r\n\r\nDose.--60-200 grams a day.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the leaves is also used to treat diarrhoea. A Hindoo\r\nphysician, Bhavaprakasa, advises the following receipt:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Juice of leaves of lomboy       }\r\n        Juice of leaves of manga        }   aa 4 grams.\r\n        Pulp of _Terminalia chebula_    }\r\n\r\n\r\nGive in one dose in a little goat's milk and honey.\r\n\r\nA sort of wine of very agreeable taste is made from the fruit\r\njuice. Lately the powdered seed has been recommended in the treatment\r\nof glycosuria or at least it has been stated that its internal use\r\nlessens and finally abolishes the glucose from the urine of the\r\npatient. It has even been affirmed that while under this treatment\r\nthe patient may eat glucose-forming foods without fear of glycosuria\r\nsupervening.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of the seeds are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Essential oil                       Traces.\r\n        Chlorophyl and fatty matters        0.37\r\n        Resin soluble in alcohol and ether  0.30\r\n        Gallic acid                         1.65\r\n        Albumin                             1.25\r\n        Pigment soluble in water            2.70\r\n        Water                              10.00\r\n        Insoluble residuum                 83.73\r\n                                          ------\r\n                                          100.00\r\n\r\n\r\nDujardin-Beaumetz has tested the therapeutic value of these seeds in\r\ndiabetes but with negative results. Scott has maintained that by adding\r\nthe powdered seed to a mixture of malt and starch, fermentation is\r\nimpeded; but Dr. Villy in the laboratory of Dujardin-Beaumetz has\r\ndemonstrated that such is not the case. Contrary to the opinions\r\nof those physicians who stated that \"jambul\" was capable of causing\r\nthe glucose to disappear from the urine of diabetic patients without\r\nconcurrent diabetic regimen, Dujardin-Beaumetz observed in his trials\r\nof the drug that the slightest relaxation of the regimen was followed\r\nby an increase of glucose. Under the influence of the medicine in doses\r\nof 2-10 grams daily, at the same time maintaining a strict diabetic\r\ndiet, the Parisian therapeutist noted that the glucose disappears\r\nfrom the third to the fifth day; but this occurred only in cases of\r\nmedium intensity, whereas in severe cases the medication produced no\r\neffect. Upon stopping the treatment the sugar reappeared.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 15-20° high, with leaves opposite,\r\nacute, entire, ovate, lustrous, very smooth. Flowers in racemose\r\npanicles with peduncles opposite. Calyx superior, with 5 small\r\nteeth and a deciduous cover composed of many orbicular pieces joined\r\nbelow. Corolla none. Stamens numerous, inserted on the edge of the\r\ncalyx. Stigma pointed. Fruit black, oval, crowned with the calyx;\r\none long cylindrical seed with membranaceous epidermis.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common all over the Archipelago. Blooms in February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMELASTOMACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Melastoma malabatrichum_, L. (_M. obvolutum_,  Jack.; _M. aspera_\r\nand _obvoluta_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Granatis_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--A decoction of the leaves is of use as an astringent in\r\ndiarrhoea and dysentery. A decoction of the bark is used as a gargle\r\nfor aphthæ and catarrhal sore throat, and as a wash for ulcers and\r\nthe itch.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is edible, resembling slightly the currant; it has doubtless\r\nreceived the name \"granatis\" on account of its many seeds.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Small tree, with opposite branches, their ends\r\ncovered with hairs. Leaves opposite, 3-nerved, 1' long, very rough\r\nwith short hairs. Flowers carmine, in terminal panicles. Stamens\r\n10. Filaments alternating violet and straw-color.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Mountains of Angat and San Mateo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLYTHRACEÆ.\r\n\r\nLoosestrife Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ammannia vesicatoria,_ Roxb.

Vulg.--_Bias pogo_, Tag.; _Blistering Ammannia_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The leaves contain an irritant and acrid principle that\r\nrenders them vesicant when applied to the skin. The Pharmacopoeia of\r\nIndia quotes Sir W. O'Shaughnessy to the effect that plasters made\r\nof the bruised leaves even when renewed every half hour require 24\r\nhours to raise a blister and at the same time cause severe pain. He\r\nfound it much more painful than cantharides and much less prompt to\r\nact. Dr. Dymock has prepared an ethereal tincture of the leaves and\r\nobtained with it results very different from those just mentioned;\r\nthis is not surprising in view of the fact that the tincture holds\r\nin solution in a small quantity of ether, a considerable amount\r\nof the vesicant principle. This tincture has the same color as the\r\n\"epispastic\" of the English Pharmacopoeia, causes less pain and rapidly\r\nraises a good blister, facts of which I have convinced myself by the\r\nuse of a small quantity sent me from Bombay in 1891.\r\n\r\nDr. Bholanauth Bose recommends the internal use of the juice of the\r\nleaves as a remedy for chronic diseases of the spleen; this treatment,\r\nhowever, has caused severe pain and is absolutely uncertain in effect.\r\n\r\nIn Concan the juice of the leaves is given mixed with food to animals\r\nin heat, for its anaphrodisiac action. The fresh or dried plant is\r\ngiven in decoction mixed with ginger in intermittent fevers.\r\n\r\nIf the ethereal tincture be evaporated a resinous residue remains that\r\nhas not been studied, but appears to be the vesicant principle. This\r\ntincture should be made from the dried leaves to avoid hydration of\r\nthe ether.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small plant with stem red, straight,\r\nquadrate, ramose. Leaves opposite, lanceolate, and fringed with\r\nhairs. Flowers axillary, small, red, solitary. Peduncles short. Calyx\r\ninferior, bell-shaped, with 8-toothed border, the 4 alternate teeth\r\nlarger. Corolla none. Nectary bell-shaped, surrounding the ovary,\r\nshorter than the calyx, with 4 toothlets which lengthening form the\r\nfilaments of as many stamens. Anthers 4-celled. Ovary of 4 pluriovulate\r\nlocules. Style almost wanting. Stigma fluted. Seed vessel glabrous,\r\nhorizontally dehiscent, containing 15 or more angular seeds joined\r\nto a common axis.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--It grows in the marshes of Mandaloyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lawsonia alba_, Lam. (_L. spinosa_, L.; _L. inermis_, Roxb.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Cinamomo del país_ (_native cinnamon_), Sp.-Fil.; _Henna_,\r\n_Camphire_, _Samphire_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This is a very popular plant in the Orient, for many races use\r\nits leaves to impart a reddish-yellow stain to the nails, finger tips\r\nand palms of the hands. There is a tradition among the Mohammedans\r\nthat the Prophet once called this plant \"the best of all herbs.\" The\r\nleaf in form of a dry powder is sold in the bazars of India under\r\nthe name of \"henna\"; mixed with water it gives it a yellow color,\r\nand when boiled the tone of the liquid becomes darker; the addition of\r\nan alkali turns it brown. In Persia they add indigo to this solution\r\nand use it as a hair dye.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos apply the bruised leaves to the soles of the feet of\r\nsmall-pox patients, their purpose being to prevent the spread of the\r\neruption to the eyes. They also use it locally in a disease known\r\namong them as \"burning of the feet.\" Grierson and Waring obtained\r\ngood results in this disease by making a paste of the bruised leaves\r\nand vinegar; cases that resisted such treatment yielded completely\r\nto a brisk rubbing of the feet with a simple paste of the leaf. The\r\ndecoction and the bruised leaves are also used locally for contusions.\r\n\r\nThe bark has been given in jaundice, hypertrophy of the spleen,\r\ncalculi of various sorts, leprosy and stubborn skin diseases, as an\r\nalterative. In decoction it is applied to burns.\r\n\r\nAn English physician, Dr. Newton, made an extract of the leaves and\r\nflowers with which he pretended to cure leprosy; it was but one more\r\nuseless drug in the long list used to combat that terrible disease. The\r\ndose of the extract is a teaspoonful daily, given in 2 doses.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the leaves is given in sweetened water in some countries\r\nas a remedy for spermatorrhoea.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are given in decoction for headache and the fruit is\r\nemmenagogue.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree, about 12° high. Leaves opposite,\r\nlanceolate, broad, entire, glabrous and tough, the edges turned\r\ndownwards. Flowers yellowish-white, terminal in racemose panicles\r\nwith opposite peduncles. Calyx inferior, bell-shaped, 4 acute\r\nsepals. Corolla, 4 petals, longer than the calyx. Stamens 8, inserted\r\nby pairs on the segments of the calyx, alternating with and longer\r\nthan the petals. Anther kidney-shaped. Ovary at the bottom of the\r\ncalyx. Styles of the same length as the stamens. Stigma obtuse. Seed\r\nvessel a little larger than a pea, globose, 4 chambers, many seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common all over the Archipelago. Blooms in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Punica Granatum_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Granada_, Sp. and Fil. dialects; _Pomegranate_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The decoction of the tender leaves is used as a gargle and\r\nwash in angina, aphthæ, and wounds within the buccal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe peel of the fruit is highly astringent and in decoction is a\r\nuseful agent in treating chronic diarrhoea, and locally in injections\r\nof lotions for leucorrhoea and inflamed hæmorrhoids. It should not\r\nbe given when rectal tenesmus exists. The Pharmacopoeia of India\r\ncontains the following formula for preparing the decoction of the peel:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Pulp of the fruit, mashed        60 grams.\r\n        Water                           600 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoil for 15 minutes in a covered vessel, cool, filter and add water\r\nenough to make a liter. Dose, 30-50 grams per diem.\r\n\r\nThis preparation is also used in astringent gargles and injections. For\r\ninternal use the decoction is rendered more active by adding a small\r\nquantity of cloves or cinnamon. This mixture with the addition of\r\nopium gives excellent results in the treatment of diarrhoea among\r\nthe natives of India and is highly recommended by Dr. Kirkpatrick.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the pomegranate, however, is its root,\r\nthe bark of which is a very efficient tænifuge and the most astringent\r\nportion of the plant. It should be used fresh, as drying destroys its\r\nactivity and gives negative results. Many failures to expel the tænia\r\nare probably due to this fact. According to Béranger-Féraud the root\r\ngives 25% to 40% of cures, whereas pumpkin seeds give but 5% to 10%.\r\n\r\nDecoction.--(French Codex.)\r\n\r\n\r\n        Fresh bark of pomegranate root      60 grams.\r\n        Water                              750 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacerate 6 hours, boil over slow fire till reduced to 500\r\ngrams. Strain. Administer fasting, in 3 doses half an hour apart. The\r\nevening before the patient should eat a light meal and take a cathartic\r\nin order that the intestinal canal may contain the smallest possible\r\nquantity of fæcal matter. After taking the third dose of the decoction\r\nthe patient should take a mild purgative such as 30 grams of castor oil\r\nto expel the tænia. This preparation has a most disagreeable taste. It\r\nis better to give the \"tannate of pelletierine,\" a compound of tannin\r\nand one of the alkaloids that Tanret discovered in pomegranate root. A\r\nsufficient dose of tannate of pelletierine is 30-40 centigrams in\r\nwafer form, followed by a purge and with the other precautions and\r\npreparatory measures mentioned above. It causes toxic symptoms similar\r\nto those produced by curare, according to the experimental studies\r\nof Dujardin-Beaumetz and Rochenière. Its action is upon the ends\r\nof the motor nerves. A dose of 40 centigrams may cause in man such\r\nsymptoms of intoxication as vertigo, inverted vision and muscular\r\nparalysis. Pelletierine should not be administered to children, but\r\nBéranger-Féraud states that the tannate may be safely given them,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tannate of pelletierine         0.30 grams.\r\n        Sweetened water                40.00 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nA coffee-spoonful of this solution contains 0.03 gram of the tannate,\r\nand this quantity may be given to a child, in a little milk. If no\r\nsymptoms supervene within one-half hour give another similar dose and\r\nso on up to 3 or 4 doses or .12 gm. in all. After the last dose give\r\nthe purgative as a routine. It is certainly imprudent to trust the\r\nadministration of such a drug to any one incapable of recognizing the\r\nsymptoms of intoxication, and as no one but a physician can judge the\r\neffects of the alkaloid he himself should remain with the patient until\r\nthe efficient dose has been absorbed. This is manifestly impractical\r\nand we therefore maintain that the alkaloid is not suited for the\r\ntreatment of children.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the root bark made by the French chemist Tanret\r\nrevealed the presence of four alkaloids: pelletierine, isopelletierine\r\n(C_8_H_15_NO), pseudo-pelletierine (C_9_H_15_NO), and methylpeletierine\r\n(C_9_H_17_NO).\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub 6-9° high with branches terminating\r\nin thorns; some of the branches abort and form thorns. Leaves simple,\r\noval, oblong, without stipules, with short petioles. Flowers axillary,\r\nsolitary or in pauciflorous cymes. Calyx, 4-8 sepals, persistent,\r\nfleshy, yellow or red. Corolla, 4-8 petals, imbricated. Stamens\r\nnumerous, free. Style 1. Stigma thick. Fruit with leathery rind,\r\nabout size of small apple, packed with seeds, each imbedded in a\r\nsmall amount of crisp, juicy pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONAGRACEÆ.\r\n\r\nEvening Primrose Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jussiæa suffruticosa_, L. (_J. villosa_, Lam.; _J. erecta_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Malapoko_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The entire plant reduced to a pulp and mixed with milk is\r\nused in India to treat dysentery. Ainslie states that the decoction\r\nis employed as a vermifuge and purgative.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--An herb with square stem, leaves alternate,\r\nlanceolate, nearly entire, glabrous. Flowers axillary, yellow,\r\nsolitary. Calyx of 4-5 lobules. Corolla, 4 lanceolate petals\r\ninserted between the divisions of the calyx. Stamens 8, of these 4\r\nalternate being shorter. Ovary very long, inferior, with 4 many-ovuled\r\nlocules. Style the same length as the stamens. Stigma 4-lobuled. Seed\r\nvessels very long, with faint longitudinal ridges, crowned by the\r\nremains of the calyx, 4 pluriovulate locules.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In the arable fields and along the banks of rivers. Blooms\r\nin January and March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSIFLORACEÆ.\r\n\r\nPassion Flower Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carica Papaya_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Papaya_, in many Phil. dialects; _Papaya_, _Papaw_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The decoction of the leaves is used locally in sores and atonic\r\nulcers, followed by a poultice of the boiled and mashed leaves. The\r\nnatives use the cold infusion of the leaves to wash clothes spotted\r\nwith blood and the spots disappear rapidly by virtue of the ferment\r\npapain which digests the fibrin. The infusion is also very useful as\r\na wash for sores and gangrenous ulcers, modifying their appearance\r\nvery rapidly.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further it is desirable to give a description of\r\npapain, a digestive ferment which exists throughout the whole plant,\r\nfruit, trunk, leaves and petioles; it is contained in the milky juice\r\nwhich exudes from all these parts when cut. This juice was studied\r\nsimultaneously by Wurtz in France and Peckolt in Brazil. The best\r\nmethod of collecting it is to make several superficial, longitudinal\r\nincisions in the green fruit without removing it from the tree;\r\nimmediately an abundance of juice appears in the incisions and\r\ncoagulates rapidly. The best time to do this is the early morning. The\r\nfruit does not suffer by this process but continues developing and\r\nripens perhaps more rapidly, at the same time improving in flavor,\r\nbecoming sweeter; the seeds, however, atrophy and lose their power\r\nof germination. Peckolt gives the following as the composition of\r\nthe juice:\r\n\r\n\r\n        A substance analogous to caoutchouc     4.525\r\n        Awa                                     2.424\r\n        Soft resin                              0.110\r\n        Brown resin                             2.776\r\n        Albuminoids                             0.006\r\n        Papayotin (Papain of Wurtz)             1.059\r\n        Extractive matter                       5.303\r\n        Malic acid                              0.443\r\n        Peptic material and salts               7.100\r\n        Water                                  74.971\r\n\r\n\r\nThe milky juice is neutral and coagulates rapidly, separating in\r\ntwo parts: a kind of insoluble pulp and a limpid colorless serum. If\r\ncombined with fibrin, raw meat, white of egg or gluten it gradually\r\nsoftens them and completely dissolves them in 3 or 4 hours _in vitro_\r\nat 40° C. Combined with milk it coagulates it and soon precipitates\r\nthe casein which is also dissolved a little later. It digests\r\nlumbricoids and tape-worms and the false membrane of croup, in a few\r\nhours. According to Wurtz and Bouchut papain is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nThe fluid juice or the aqueous solution of the milky exudate is\r\nprecipitated by the addition of ten times the volume of alcohol. The\r\nprecipitate, after treating again with concentrated alcohol, is\r\ndissolved in water and the addition of sub-acetate of lead eliminates\r\nthe albuminoids and peptones but does not precipitate the papain. The\r\nliquid is filtered and the lead salts separated by means of a current\r\nof hydrogen sulphide. It is filtered again and alcohol added gradually,\r\nwhich process first precipitates whatever sulphate of lead may have\r\npassed through the filter, and then the papain.\r\n\r\nPapain is an amorphous substance, perfectly white, soluble in water,\r\ninsipid, odorless. An aqueous solution, if shaken violently, foams like\r\na solution of soap. Boiling makes it turbid and when concentrated it\r\nhas a slightly astringent taste. It is precipitated by hydrochloric,\r\nnitric, picric and the metaphosphoric acids. Trommer's test gives it a\r\nbeautiful blue violet color which, on boiling, changes to a red violet.\r\n\r\nIt is an extremely active digestive ferment, comparable with pepsin,\r\nbut superior to the latter because it does not require an acid medium,\r\nas its digestive action takes place even in the presence of an alkaline\r\nmedium and of antiseptic substances such as boric acid, phenol, etc. It\r\nis given in doses of 10-40 centigrams in different vehicles such as\r\nwater, wine, etc. It should be given after meals carefully and properly\r\ndiluted, in order that its action may not be exerted upon the gastric\r\nmucous membrane itself. Its use is contraindicated in gastric ulcer.\r\n\r\nA watery solution prepared by macerating the green fruit has been\r\nused effectively to remove blemishes from the face, leaving the skin\r\nclean and smooth. The natives use little pieces of the green fruit to\r\nremove freckles (which they call _pecas_). The ripe fruit is edible\r\nand its taste quite agreeable; in some of the Malay Islands it is\r\ngiven for dysentery, but it must be remembered that the ripe fruit\r\ndoes not contain papain.\r\n\r\nThe pure exudate is given to children as an anthelmintic in doses of\r\n2-6 grams with a little molasses, but it is not so harmless that it\r\nmay be used with impunity in this form, Moncorvo and others having\r\nreported cases of peritonitis with symptoms suggestive of cholera\r\nfollowing its use. It is drastic and digestive in addition to its\r\nanthelmintic action, but according to Rabuteau, boiling destroys the\r\nfirst property without affecting the others. Dr. Lemarchand of the\r\nisland of Mauritius gives the following anthelmintic prescription:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Juice of papaya and molasses    aa 1 tablespoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd gradually while shaking the mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Boiling water                      4 tablespoons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCool and administer in one dose followed immediately by 30 grams of\r\ncastor oil. For a child, one-half dose.\r\n\r\nThis treatment frequently causes colic, for the relief of which the\r\nauthor advises an injection of sweetened water. Sir O'Shaughnessy's\r\nprescription is preferable:\r\n\r\n\r\n    20-60 drops of the exudate in a little sweetened water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dose cannot cause any untoward symptoms and is efficient in\r\nexpelling both lumbricoids and tæniæ.\r\n\r\nThe triturated seeds may be given internally in doses of 1-2 grams\r\nwith milk or molasses to expel lumbricoids. Analysis has revealed\r\nin the seeds the presence of a resinous oil, an oleaginous material\r\nof disagreeable odor and taste called by Peckolt _caricin_, a fatty\r\nacid, papayic acid and a resin. In India the seeds are considered\r\nemmenagogue. In some countries they wrap meat in papaya leaves\r\nfor several hours before eating in order to soften it. For the same\r\npurpose they sometimes boil the meat in water containing a few leaves\r\nor pieces of the green fruit; some even go to the length of saying\r\nthat it is only necessary to hang a piece of meat in a papaya tree\r\nfor a time in order to soften it.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of the green fruit is given internally for indigestion,\r\na treatment common in the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga. The milky\r\njuice is used to remove corns and Dr. Daruty offers the following\r\nprescription for eczema and psoriasis:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Exudate of papaya           1.00 grams.\r\n        Borax (powdered)            0.60 grams.\r\n        Water                      16.00 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix.\r\n\r\nPaint the affected part with feather or brush, 2-3 times a day. The\r\nsame solution may be used for softening corns.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Trees 15° in height, trunk covered with large\r\nleaf scars, wood soft and brittle, the long-petioled, palmately-lobed\r\nleaves growing in a crown and giving the tree the general appearance of\r\na palm. Flowers dioecious. Staminate tree: Flowers loosely clustered on\r\nlong, hanging stems. Calyx, 5-6 teeth. Corolla tubular, 1' long, limb\r\ndivided into 5 oval parts. Stamens 10, inserted in the throat. Style\r\nshort, awl-shaped. Pistillate tree: Flowers much larger, sessile,\r\nin axils of leaves. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla large, 5 lanceolate\r\npetals curved outward, fleshy. Stigmas 5, fringed. Fruit about size of\r\nchild's head or smaller, somewhat pear-shaped, juicy, pulp melon-like,\r\n1 compartment with numerous seeds, each in a mucilaginous aril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCURBITACEÆ.\r\n\r\nGourd Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trichosanthes palmata_, Roxb. (_T. tricuspis_, Mig.; _T. lucioniana_,\r\nBares.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--(?).\r\n\r\nUses.--Roxburgh states that the fruit is toxic and sometimes used\r\nto kill crows. Dymock states that the leaf is smoked in Bombay as a\r\nremedy for asthma.\r\n\r\nThe extremely bitter taste of the fruit and rind induced Sir\r\nW. O'Shaughnessy to examine it for tonic and purgative properties;\r\ndoses as high as 0.20 gram 3 times a day failed to exert a purgative\r\neffect. The root is used in veterinary medicine particularly for\r\npneumonia. Mixed with equal parts of colocynth it is applied to\r\ncarbuncles. In combination with equal parts of _Terminalia chebula_\r\nand ginger it is made into a sweetened infusion for internal use\r\nin gonorrhoea.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A climber with broad, heart-shaped,\r\nserrate, 7-lobulate leaves. Flowers monoecious; staminate white and\r\nracemose; pistillate solitary, growing at the base of the staminate\r\nracemes. Staminate receptacle tubular, calyx inserted on the border\r\nof the receptacle, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 5, of which\r\n4 are in pairs. Pistillate: the receptacle dilates in its lower part\r\nin form of a globose vase and encloses the unilocular pluriovulate\r\novary. Fruit ovoid or pyriform, scarlet when fresh, orange-yellow\r\nwhen dry. Seeds of irregular form, somewhat triangular. Kernel oily.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_T. anguina_, L.

Vulg.--Probably the same as _T. anguina_.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit of _T. anguina_ is purgative, emetic and\r\nanthelmintic. The natives use an infusion of the filamentous,\r\nreticulate portion surrounding the seeds, in doses of 0.50-0.60 gm.,\r\naccording to P. Blanco.\r\n\r\nThe second species, _T. cucumerina_, has a wider use. In India it is\r\nregarded as a febrifuge and laxative and is commonly given with some\r\naromatic. Ainslie notes that the leaves, as well as the fruit, are\r\nbitter and purgative and that the Tamuls use them for their laxative\r\nand stomachic effect. Drury states that on the Malabar coast the seeds\r\nhave a considerable reputation as a remedy for functional disorders\r\nof the stomach. Although the green fruit is very bitter the natives\r\nof that region use it as a condiment. The tender stems and the dry\r\ncapsules, both bitter and purgative, are given in infusion and in a\r\nsweetened solution, as an aid to digestion. The seeds are febrifuge\r\nand anthelmintic. The juice of the leaves is emetic and that of the\r\nroots purgative. The decoction of the stem is expectorant.\r\n\r\nIn Bombay the plant is considered febrifuge, and is given in decoction\r\nwith ginger, _Swertia chirata_, and sugar. The Mohammedan authors\r\nsay that the _T. cucumerina_ is effective in expelling lumbricoids\r\nand one of them mentions the following as a cure for stubborn fevers:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Seeds of _T. cucumerina_        No. 180.\r\n        Seeds of coriander or cumin     No. 180.\r\n        Boiling water                       200 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet stand over night, filter, add a little sugar, administer in\r\n2 doses morning and evening.\r\n\r\nIn Concan they use the juice of the leaves as a liniment in remittent\r\nfevers, rubbing the hepatic region and in fact the entire body.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--_T. anguina_, L., is a vine with 5-angled stem,\r\nbearing tendrils and spattered with white dots. Leaves heart-shaped,\r\nwith 5 acute lobules, spiny-toothed. Petioles with a bifid swelling\r\nat their bases. Flowers white, monoecious. Staminate: calyx 5-toothed\r\nwith dotted borders; corolla, 5 fringed petals; stamens 3; anthers\r\n3, entirely united and forming a cylinder. Pistillate: 3 glandules\r\nin the corolla tube; style long; stigmas 3. Fruit ribbed, long, the\r\ncompartments formed by reticular partitions; contains many irregular\r\nseeds, one border sharp, the other obtuse, covered by a very thin aril.\r\n\r\nThe _T. cucumerina_, L., is less common, bears a spindle-shaped or\r\nobovate fruit, is hairy and lacks ribs. Its seeds are ovoid, very\r\nsmooth, encircled by a narrow wing. The reticulum within the fruit\r\nis similar to that of the foregoing species.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts of the islands. Blooms in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lagenaria vulgaris_, Ser.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Common Gourd_, _Bottle Gourd_, _Calabash_, Eng.\r\n\r\n\r\nVar. _Lagenaria Gourda_, Ser.

All have the same\r\naction and hence the same therapeutic application. The green portion of\r\nthe rind is bitter and possesses purgative and emetic properties. The\r\ndecoction of the tender shoots is expectorant; in addition it appears\r\nto possess purgative properties and in India is used in jaundice.\r\n\r\nThe part of the plant most generally used is the seeds, the tænifuge\r\nproperties of which are well known. Its action, however, is not always\r\ncertain, which may be as truly said of all other known tænifuges. The\r\nseeds have the advantage of lacking the disgusting taste characteristic\r\nof other remedies of the same class; the taste is almost neutral and\r\na little sugar conceals it completely. The dose is unlimited; some\r\ntake 15 grams, others as high as 100, and no unpleasant symptoms of\r\nany kind have been reported. The only precaution to be observed is\r\nto give the patient a purgative 1-2 hours after his dose.\r\n\r\nHeckel has analyzed the seeds and found a resin which he calls\r\n_pepo-resina_; it exists in the greenish pellicle that envelopes\r\nthe embryo and appears to be the active principle of the seeds. Its\r\ndose is 0.80-1.00 gram (Dujardin-Beaumetz), the product of 250 grams\r\nof the seeds. The dose of 100 grams of the seeds mentioned above is\r\nvery small, if the pepo-resin represents the entire active principle,\r\nfor 100 grams of the seeds would only contain about 40 centigrams.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A very familiar vine, clammy, pubescent\r\nand musk-scented; large leaves, long-stalked flowers, white petals,\r\ngreenish veiny fruit usually club-shaped or enlarged at the apex, the\r\nhard rind used for vessels, dippers, and so forth. It is noteworthy\r\nthat none of the tænifuge varieties mentioned bears yellow fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Luffa Ægyptiaca_, Mill. (_L. pentandra_, Roxb.; _L. petola_, Ser.;\r\n_Momordica operculata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--Probably bears the same names as the _Trichosanthes_.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root is a hydragogue cathartic even in minute doses. The\r\nfruit is emollient by virtue of the large quantity of mucilage it\r\ncontains, but it is more interesting for other properties. When cut\r\nin two, deprived of epidermis and seeds, and washed until none of the\r\nmucilage remains, there is left a fibrous skeleton, a sort of skein of\r\ninterwoven nets that constitutes the so-called vegetable sponge. It\r\nserves the same purpose as a sponge and has the advantages that its\r\nfibers do not rot and that they are easily kept clean. In view of its\r\ncheapness and plentifulness in the Philippines the above advantages\r\nshould suffice to bring it into universal use for the toilet, for\r\nsurgical purposes and for cleaning in general.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A vine with square, glabrous stem. Leaves\r\nalternate, cordate, 3-5-lobulate, dentate, rough, 5-7-nerved. Petioles\r\nshort. Flowers monoecious. Staminate in axillary panicles; calyx\r\nbell-shaped; corolla yellow, 5 oval petals, borders entire; stamens\r\n3; filaments short; two thick ones divide high up in 2 parts, thus\r\ngiving the appearance of 5 stamens in all. Pistillate axillary,\r\ncalyx adherent, 5 pointed sepals; corolla, 5 nearly triangular petals,\r\nfinely dentate; style thick, short, the base encircled by 3 glandules;\r\nstigma cordate. Ovary, 3 pseudo-locules formed by the central union\r\nof the placentas; pluriovulate. Fruit oblong, terminating at the apex\r\nin a deciduous lid or cover, marked with 8 or 10 black longitudinal\r\nlines; the interior reticulate, 3 compartments with many seeds, oval,\r\nblack, flat with thin borders. The natives do not distinguish between\r\nthis specimen and the _Trichosanthes_, but it is to be noted that\r\nthe corolla of the former is not ravelled or fringed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon and Panay. Blooms in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Momordica balsamina_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Ampalaya_, _Ampalea_, Tag.; _Amargoso_, Sp.-Fil.; _Paria_,\r\nIloc.; _Apalia_, Pam.; _Balsamina_, Sp.; _Balsam Apple_, Eng.\r\n\r\n_M. charanta_, L. (_M. muricata_, Willd.; _M. cylindrica_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--The same as of _M. balsamina_.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit of both varieties is edible, though a bitter principle\r\ngives it such an intensely bitter taste that it is intolerable to\r\nthe unaccustomed palate. It is eaten raw as a salad, or cooked with\r\nmeat or fish. The juice of the leaves is prescribed internally as a\r\npurgative and anthelmintic. In Concan it is given alone or combined\r\nwith aromatics, in bilious disorders as an emetic and purgative;\r\nexternally they use it as an ointment for the itch and other skin\r\ndiseases; in India it is mixed with cinnamon, pepper, rice and oil\r\nof _Hydnocarpus inebrians_, Vahl.\r\n\r\nThe fruit and leaves are used internally for worms and externally\r\nfor leprosy. Some Hindoo writers state that the fruit is tonic and\r\nstomachic, and that it is useful in rheumatism, gout, diseases of\r\nthe liver and spleen.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The first variety, _M. balsamina_, more\r\ncommon than the second, is a vine with angular stem and simple\r\ntendrils. Leaves, many serrate lobules with white dots on the\r\nends. Flowers yellow, monoecious. Staminate solitary, peduncles very\r\nlong, involucre cordate; calyx 5-lobed; corolla 5 petals; filaments\r\nsimple, one separate, 2 approximated; anthers joined at their\r\nbases. Pistillate solitary; ovary, 3 locules and numerous ovules;\r\nstigma, 3 bifid divisions; fruit globose, narrowing at the ends,\r\ncovered with tubercles; seeds numerous, lacking albumen, having\r\nred aril.\r\n\r\nThe second variety, _M. cylindrica_, has a downy stem, 5-angled with\r\nsimple tendrils. The leaves are 5-lobuled, cordate, serrate, with\r\nshort hairs on under surface. Melon hollow, glabrous, very long,\r\ncylindrical, tapering at the ends, covered with tubercles, some\r\nelevated in longitudinal lines, others depressed; seeds in 3 rows,\r\nenveloped in pulpy arils, white, long quadrangular, truncate above,\r\nencircled by 2 rows of obtuse toothlets.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Both grow in all parts and are well known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Citrullus Colocynthis_, Schard. (_Cucumis Colocynthis_, L.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Coloquíntida_, Sp.; _Colocynth_, _Bitter Apple_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The part employed is the fruit pulp, official in all the\r\npharmacopoeias as a very energetic hydragogue cathartic. It is seldom\r\ngiven alone, but in combination with other drugs to modify its energy\r\nand its action.\r\n\r\nIn large doses it causes vomiting, bloody diarrhoea and a series of\r\nnervous phenomena that may end in death. Six to ten grams constitute\r\na toxic dose. It operates with most force upon the large intestines\r\nand sympathetically upon the uterus.\r\n\r\nDose.--Extract, 0.10-0.30 gram; powder, 0.30-1.00 gram.\r\n\r\nThe pulp contains a yellow, intensely bitter substance, quite soluble\r\nin water and in alcohol, discovered by Hubschmann and named by him\r\n_coloquintina_. The seeds contain 17% of an insipid oil.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--An herb with long, prostrate stems covered with\r\nstiff hairs. Leaves alternate, triangular, deeply cleft in 3 lobules\r\nthat subdivide. Petioles long. The color of the leaves is pale green\r\nabove, whitish or gray and covered with white hairs underneath. Flowers\r\nyellow, monoecious, solitary, axillary, with long peduncles. Staminate:\r\nreceptacle cup-formed, 5 sepals and 5 free, yellow petals; 5 stamens in\r\npairs, one free. Pistillate: the receptacle globose, covering the lower\r\npart of the ovary; 3 staminodes take the place of the stamens. Ovary\r\nunilocular, uniovulate, with a short style bearing 3 lobules at its\r\napex. Fruit globose, 6-8 centimeters in diameter, smooth, greenish,\r\nlater yellow with white spots; it is full of a whitish pulp that\r\nbecomes dry and pithy and that contains the obovate seeds, smooth,\r\nflattened, brown, lacking albumen.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFICOIDEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trianthema monogyna_, L. (_T. obcordata_, Roxb.; _Portulaca toston_\r\nand _axiflora_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Toston_, Tag.; _Alusiman_, _Ayam_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant is edible, the natives eating it boiled, fried or\r\nin salad. The root is cathartic and is used powdered.\r\n\r\n_Botanical Description._--A plant with prostrate stems, radiating\r\nbranches. Leaves ensheathing the stem, opposite, oval, red-bordered,\r\nglabrous. Petioles with 2 stipules at the base and 2 small teeth near\r\nthe middle. Flowers axillary, solitary, sessile. Calyx, 2 pointed\r\nsepals. Corolla, 5 oval petals. Stamens 15-20. Style simple. Seed\r\nvessels inversely pyramidal, dehiscence horizontal. Seeds numerous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in the rice fields. Blooms in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUMBELLIFERÆ.\r\n\r\nParsley Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydrocotyle Asiatica_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Takip kohol_, _Takip suso_, Tag.; _Rabasa_, Sp.; _Indian\r\nPennywort_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--Dr. Daruty, of Mauritius, has published a study of this plant,\r\ngiving a résumé of its composition, therapeutic uses and physiological\r\naction. The writers of antiquity recognized the plant as a powerful\r\nalterative, tonic, diuretic, stimulant and vermifuge, especially\r\neffective in secondary syphilis and in ulcerative diseases of the skin.\r\n\r\nLépine and Boileau used it experimentally to treat leprosy and\r\nreported favorably; but later experience demonstrated that it did\r\nnot exercise any specific effect, but benefited anæsthetic leprosy\r\nsimply by improving the general condition of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe plant is official in the Pharmacopoeia of India, as alterative,\r\ntonic and stimulant. It states that the drug has been found very\r\nuseful in the treatment of secondary and constitutional syphilis,\r\nwhen the disease attacks the skin and subcutaneous tissue.\r\n\r\nIn Bombay it is a popular remedy for the mild dysentery of children,\r\ngiven as a decoction of 3 or 4 leaves with a little cumin seed and\r\nsugar; the bruised leaves are then applied to the umbilical region. In\r\nthe Philippines the decoction of the leaves is given as a purge.\r\n\r\nDr. Dervegie reports good results in the treatment of eczema,\r\nadministering the powdered leaf in dozes of 0.10 gram and applying\r\nlocally the powder or an ointment of the same. The most marked and\r\nconstant effects of the drug are a considerable increase of the\r\nurinary secretion, elevation of the temperature of the skin and\r\nprofuse diaphoresis.\r\n\r\nDr. Boileau, quoted above, himself contracted leprosy of which he died;\r\nhe experimented on himself with \"hydrocotyle\" and on one occasion\r\na dose of 3 grams nearly proved fatal; tetanic symptoms supervened\r\nwith suffocation, palpitation, epistaxis and rectal hemorrhage,\r\nabating finally with profuse sweating and diuresis.\r\n\r\nDr. Lépine, a pharmacist of Pondicherry, has analyzed the plant\r\nand isolated a substance that seems to be the active principle;\r\nhe has named it _vallarin_, from \"vallarai,\" the Tamul name of\r\nthe plant. \"Vallarin\" is a thick, pale yellow oil of a piquant and\r\npersistent taste and an odor peculiar to the plant. It changes under\r\nthe influence of air, moisture or heat and volatilizes at 120°. It\r\nis soluble in alcohol. The plant contains 8/10 to 1% of this oil,\r\na dark resin and a green resin.\r\n\r\nThe Pharmacopoeia of India gives 2 official formulæ, a powder and a\r\ncataplasm. The powdered leaf is given internally in doses of 0.30 to\r\n1.50 grams and is applied locally to superficial ulcers.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Plant herbaceous with reniform or heart-shaped\r\nleaves, forming a sort of funnel, dotted with little hairs, dentate\r\nwith white tips. Petioles very long, ensheathing each other by 2 wings\r\nat their bases. Flowers 3-4, sessile, springing directly from the root,\r\ngreenish-white, growing in horizontal rows on either side of a short,\r\ncommon peduncle. Common involucre of 2-3 leaflets. Calyx adherent,\r\nflattened, faintly toothed. Corolla, 5 small petals, ovate. Stamens\r\n5, equal in height, inserted on the receptacle, alternating with\r\nthe petals. Filaments short. Anthers globose, cleft at the base in 2\r\ndiverging parts. Ovary inferior, cordate, much flattened. Styles 2,\r\nshort. Stigmas simple. Fruit truncate, oval, downy, indehiscent,\r\nmarked with furrows, with 2 compartments each containing a seed\r\ninserted on the wall.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows in shady and moist places. Blooms in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carum copticum_, Benth. (_C. ajowan_, DC.; _Ammi copticum_, L.;\r\n_A. glaucifolium_, Blanco; _Daucus opticus_, Pers.; _D. anisodorus_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Lamudio_, _Damoro_, Tag.; _Lamudio_, Vis.; _Caraway_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit, of which both form and taste remind one of anise,\r\nis official in the Pharmacopoeia of India as a carminative, stimulant\r\nand antispasmodic. It is indicated in flatulent colic, atonic dyspepsia\r\nand diarrhoea and gives very good results. It has been used in cholera,\r\nbut is of little value in that disease. In moderate doses it increases\r\nsalivary and gastric secretion.\r\n\r\nThe P. of India contains the 2 following official formulæ:\r\n_Oleum_--obtained from the fruit by distillation; is colorless when\r\nfresh but soon turns yellow; possesses the odor of the fruit and an\r\nacrid, burning taste. _Aqua_--600 grams of the fruit ground and mixed\r\nwith 9 liters of water; this is distilled till 4 1/2 liters have gone\r\nover, these constituting the \"aqua cari.\"\r\n\r\nDose.--1-2 drops of the essential oil in emulsion or on a piece of\r\nsugar. Of the \"aqua,\" 30-60 grams as a carminative or to disguise the\r\ntaste of other drugs (such as castor oil), thus frequently preventing\r\nnausea or vomiting.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Leaves finely pinnately compound. Common\r\npetiole clasps the stem at the base. Flowers white, in flat\r\ncompound umbels. The secondary peduncles 12. Flowerets of each\r\npartial umbel about 16. Calyx of flowerets superior, 5 globose\r\nsepals. Corolla, 5 equal petals, with rounded lobules. Stamens 5. Ovary\r\ntuberculate. Styles 2, very short. Seeds 2, united, furrowed and\r\nnearly glabrous at maturity.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Cultivated in gardens. Blooms in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foeniculum vulgare_, Gaertn. (_F. officinale_, Allion; _F. panmorium_,\r\nDC.; _Anethum foeniculum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Anis_, Sp.; _Fennel_, Eng.\r\n\r\nCoriandrum sativum, L. (_Cuminum cynimum_, Wall.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Cominos_, _Calantro_, Sp.; _Coriander_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit of both species has the same therapeutical application\r\nbeing stomachic and carminative par excellence. It yields an aromatic\r\nessential oil with stimulant properties, popular because of its\r\nagreeable odor and taste.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the infusion is given in doses of one liter a day (15-30\r\ngrams of the seeds to one liter of water). The essence and the\r\nalcoholate are also employed, the former obtained by distillation,\r\nthe latter by macerating the fresh seeds in alcohol. The dose of the\r\nessence, 4-8 drops on a piece of sugar or in potion; the alcoholate,\r\n2-10 grams in sweetened water or infusion of aromatic herbs.\r\n\r\nBoth plants are official in the Spanish Pharmacopoeia and they and\r\ntheir preparations are common in all drug stores.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common, cultivated in the gardens and well known.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--_F. vulgare_: Aromatic, stout, smooth herb,\r\n4-6° high. Leaves with many slender thread-like divisions. Large umbel\r\nof yellow flowers, no involucre and no involucels. _C. sativum_: Low\r\naromatic herb, leaves pinnately compound, small umbels with few rays,\r\nflowers white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNACEÆ.\r\n\r\nDogwood Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alangium Lamarkii_, Thwaites. (_A. decapetalum_, _hexapetalum_\r\nand _tomentosum_, Lam.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--(?)\r\n\r\nUses.--According to Mooden Sheriff, the root bark is an efficient\r\nemetic in doses of 3 grams. In smaller doses it is febrifuge and\r\nproduces nausea. The bark is extremely bitter; its reputation in the\r\ntreatment of skin diseases is undeserved. It is a good substitute\r\nfor ipecac, having given good results in all conditions in which the\r\nlatter is indicated, with the exception of dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe febrifuge dose is 0.35-0.60 gram; alterative, 0.15-0.30 gram.\r\n\r\nIt is furthermore prescribed in India for syphilis and leprosy and\r\nis one of the many remedies used for the bites of rabid animals. The\r\nbruised leaves are applied to the joints of rheumatic patients.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree 20-30 meters high, leaves alternate,\r\npersistent, petiolate, no stipules, oblong, dentate, acuminate,\r\npinnately nerved. Flowers whitish, regular, hermaphrodite, in\r\nterminal cymes. Receptacle concave. Calyx short, 10-toothed. Corolla,\r\n10 narrow, elongated ribbon-like petals. Stamens 30-40, filaments\r\nfree and glabrous. Ovary inferior, held in the concavity of the\r\nreceptacle, one-celled, with 1 seed, crowned by an epigynous disc,\r\nabove which rises a simple style with dilated stigma. Fruit a globose\r\ndrupe, crowned by the calyx, with 10 inconspicuous ribs. The putamen\r\nencloses an albuminous kernel.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--The mountains of San Mateo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDICOTYLEDONOUS, GAMOPETALOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUBIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nMadder Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hymenodictyon excelsum_, Wall. (_H. Horsfieldii_, Miq.; _Chinchona\r\nexcelsa_, Roxb.; _Exostema Philippicum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Huligaga_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The bark of this tree has a wide reputation in India as a tonic\r\nand febrifuge. The inner layer of the bark possesses astringent and\r\nbitter properties much like quinine. Ainslie states that it is used\r\nin India to tan hides and therapeutically where an astringent is\r\nrequired. O'Shaughnessy experimented with it in the hospital of the\r\nMedical College of Calcutta and reported good tonic and antipyretic\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, according to Dymock, Broughton analyzed the fresh bark and\r\nreported that the bitter taste was due to _esculin_, which after drying\r\nand coming in contact with decomposing organic matter is transformed\r\ninto the almost tasteless _esculetin_. Naylor studied the bark at\r\na later period, and attributed the bitterness to an alkaloid that\r\nhe named _hymenodictyonine_. This substance exists in the form of a\r\ngelatinous mass, cream-colored, very hygroscopic. An ethereal solution,\r\ncarefully evaporated, deposits it in the form of crystals. Its\r\nempirical form is C_23_H_40_N_2_; it is probably volatile and is\r\nnotable for its lack of oxygen. It differs from _quinoidine_ in that\r\nit is inactive (?) and that in combination with platinum it retains\r\nless of this metal than does quinoidine. It differs from _paricine_\r\nin its proportion of hydrogen, and from _berberine_ in containing more\r\ncarbon. In the presence of sulphuric acid its solution assumes a yellow\r\ncolor, changing to wine-red and then to dark red. Naylor extracted\r\nanother principle which he found combined with the alkaloid in a soda\r\nprecipitate of the latter; it is a product of the decomposition of a\r\nglucose, the formula of which is C_25_H_49_O_7_. This compound remains\r\ninsoluble when the alkaloid is treated with ether. Repeated boiling\r\nin alcohol renders it colorless. It is bitter, soluble in alcohol\r\nand dilute acids; insoluble in ether and chloroform. Reaction, neutral.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large tree, with leaves opposite,\r\noval, entire, acute, downy. Petioles long, flat above, with 2\r\nstipules. Flowers axillary, in compound verticillate racemes. Calyx\r\nadherent, with 5 promptly deciduous teeth which leave a scar that also\r\ndisappears. Corolla much longer than the calyx, funnel-form, the limb\r\n5-cleft. Stamens 5, inserted near the middle of the tube. Filaments\r\nrudimentary. Anthers 2-celled. Style longer than the corolla. Stigma\r\nglobose. Seed-vessel rather rough, ovoid, flattened, of 2 compartments,\r\nwhere are inserted numerous seeds, imbricated, circular, encircled\r\nby an entire wing.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Angat and the woods of San Mateo. Blooms in\r\nAugust. (P. Blanco states further that this tree grows to a height of\r\nabout 3 yards in Angat and that it exhales a strong odor resembling\r\nthat of vinegar at times, and again like that of tobacco.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oldenlandia corymbosa_, L. (_O. biflora_, Lam.; _O. ramosa_, Roxb.;\r\n_O. herbacea_ and _serabrida_, DC.; _O. burmaniana_, Mig.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--Doubtful.\r\n\r\n_Uses._--The Sanscrit writers often mention this plant as an important\r\nremedy for the fevers due, according to their theories, to disordered\r\nbile, _i. e._, remittent fevers, accompanied by gastric irritability\r\nand nervous depression. The entire plant is used to make a decoction,\r\noften combined with aromatics. Dymock observed in Goa that this plant\r\ncould be gotten in all the shops of the herb-venders, and that it\r\nwas widely used as an alterative in mild fevers in combination with\r\n_\"Hydrocotyle Asiatica_ and _Adiantum lunulatum_.\"\r\n\r\nIn Concan they apply the juice to the hands and feet in fevers,\r\ngiving at the same time a dose of one \"tola\" (6.80 grams) in sweetened\r\nwater or milk. This juice is obtained by soaking the bruised plant\r\nin water. In remittent fever the decoction is also used as a liniment\r\nfor the whole body. It is given internally for skin eruptions due to\r\nexcessive heat, especially \"lichen tropicus.\"\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small herb, stem straight, about 30\r\ncentimeters high, glabrous, dichotomous. Leaves opposite, linear,\r\ngreen, lanceolate, stipulate. Flowers small, hermaphrodite, axillary,\r\nsolitary, or in pairs, alternate or opposite. Calyx gamosepalous with\r\n5 short teeth. Corolla gamopetalous, funnel-shaped. Stamens 5, free,\r\ninserted in the tube of the corolla. Ovary inserted in the hollow\r\nof the receptacle, 2 many-ovuled locules. Style simple, ending in\r\na bifid stigma. Capsule rounded-oval, membranous. Seeds numerous,\r\npolyhedrous, albuminous, surface granular.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In the rice fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Randia dumetorum_, Lam. (_R. longispina_, DC.; _R. aculata_, Blanco;\r\n_R. stipulosa_, Miq.; _Gardenia spinosa_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sinampaga_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit is used in some parts of India to kill the fish in\r\nponds and sluggish rivers, the same use to which they sometimes put the\r\n\"Cocculus Indicus.\" It is prescribed as an emetic by the Sanscrit and\r\nArabic medical authors of India. Mooden Sheriff ascribes its emetic\r\nproperties to the pulp alone, the epicarp and seeds being inactive\r\naccording to his authority. It is a substitute for ipecac even in the\r\ntreatment of dysentery in which case the decoction of the trunk bark\r\nis also used.\r\n\r\nThe dried and powdered pulp is given in dose of 2.50 grams as an\r\nemetic and 1-2 grams as an antidysenteric. To prepare the fresh fruit\r\nfor administration as an emetic, mash 2-3, macerate 15 minutes in\r\n150-200 grams of water and filter. It acts in a few minutes and its\r\neffect may be hastened by giving tepid water or tickling the fauces.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub with straight, thorny stem, leaves\r\nsessile, springing from the buds, occurring in threes, obtusely\r\nlanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers solitary or in pairs, very\r\nfragrant. Calyx gamosepalous with 10 toothlets. Corolla twisted,\r\narched, cleft in the middle, throat nude, limb slashed in 5 large\r\nglabrous parts. Stamens 5. Filaments short, inserted on corolla. Style\r\n1. Stigma bifid. Fruit inferior, about the size of a crab apple,\r\ncrowned by the remains of the calyx, smooth, yellow, fleshy, 1-celled\r\nwith many seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--On the coast of Luzon. Blooms in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ixora coccinea_, L. (_I. bandhuca_, Roxb.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Santan_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The handsome red flowers are used in decoction for hæmoptysis\r\nand catarrhal bronchitis. Both root and flower are astringent and\r\nare given for dysentery. In Concan they cook 2 \"tolas\" (13.60 grams)\r\nof the flowers in lard, together with coriander and \"mesua ferrea,\"\r\nadd a little candied sugar and divide the mass into large pills to\r\nbe given twice a day.\r\n\r\nThe fresh root in the form of an alcoholic tincture has been\r\nrecommended by Deb for dysentery, the dose 2-4 grams in an appropriate\r\npotion. The tincture of the fresh plant is prepared by macerating\r\n126 grams of the fresh root 15 days in 473 grams alcohol. The plant\r\nhas been used in intermittent fevers and various skin diseases.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub cultivated in all gardens, 6-8°\r\nhigh. Leaves oval, entire, glabrous. Flowers in terminal umbels, white,\r\npink or red. Corolla tubular with limb cleft in 4 rounded lobes. The\r\nplant is so well known that further description would be superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coffea Arabica_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Cafe_, Sp.; _Coffee_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The infusion of roasted and ground coffee seeds constitutes\r\na beverage of Arabic origin, but now common all over the world. In\r\nthe Philippines, where a few years ago the coffee plant was only\r\ncultivated in gardens, the harvest has assumed such proportions\r\nthat it now constitutes one of the greatest sources of agricultural\r\nwealth. Its use is becoming more general every day and the discovery\r\nof its alkaloid \"caffeine\" the therapeutical use of which is also\r\nsteadily increasing, has given new importance to the seed on account\r\nof its increasing demand in the drug trade. When newly harvested its\r\ntaste is not very agreeable, for it needs considerable time--2 or 3\r\nyears--in which to dry completely, before it acquires the aromatic\r\nproperties and the savor of which it is susceptible. General Morin\r\nrelates an incident of having drunk a delicious infusion of coffee\r\nmade from authentic Moka that had been kept for fifty years, of course\r\nunder ideal conditions of preservation.\r\n\r\nIn civilized countries coffee is an article of prime necessity as a\r\nfood; here we shall consider it therapeutically under two heads, as\r\na tonic-stimulant and as an antiseptic. As caffeine is the principle\r\nthat acts upon the heart we shall consider the cardiac properties of\r\ncoffee under the head of that alkaloid, so important that it may best\r\nbe studied separately.\r\n\r\nThere are two preparations of coffee, the decoction used by the Arabs\r\nand the infusion, used in Europe and adopted in the Philippines. The\r\ndecoction forms a tonic and aromatic drink devoid of any excitant\r\nproperties, but the infusion is highly excitant and should not be\r\ntaken in such large amounts as the decoction, for its action may be\r\npowerful enough to cause headache, nausea, trembling of the extremities\r\nand disorders of vision and hearing. These phenomena however are not\r\ndangerous and rapidly subside as soon as the urine eliminates the\r\nsubstances that cause them.\r\n\r\nInfusion of coffee stimulates especially the cerebral functions and\r\nthe circulation; as to its digestive properties, opinion is divided\r\nbut it is more probable that it lacks them and that coffee taken\r\nafter meals owes its reputation as a digestive aid to two distinct\r\nfactors--the temperature and the sugar. Without doubt it exerts an\r\nanaphrodisiac action, on account of which the illustrious Linnæus\r\ncalled it the \"drink of eunuchs.\" This action seems incompatible with\r\nthe fact that the Arabs, who are so much given to the abuse of the\r\npleasures forbidden to eunuchs are most addicted to the use and abuse\r\nof coffee. The explanation rests in the form in which they consume\r\ntheir coffee, namely the decoction, which is free from the sedative\r\nprinciple of the seed, that undoubtedly resides in the aromatic\r\ningredient \"cafeol.\"\r\n\r\nCoffee is contraindicated in hysterical and nervous persons, in\r\nchildren and in those who suffer with insomnia or palpitation. It\r\ncounteracts sleep and coma, being very useful in poisoning by opium or\r\nits alkaloids. Its stimulant action is as rapid as that of alcohol. On\r\nseveral occasions it has yielded me marked results when given by\r\nstomach or by enema in cases of nervous and cardiac depression. Indeed\r\nit is a remedy that I cannot recommend too highly and each day leaves\r\nme more convinced of its therapeutic activity and certainty.\r\n\r\nAttention has only lately been directed to the antiseptic property of\r\ncoffee though we have long been availing ourselves of that property\r\nwithout knowing it; this is true of many other medicinal agents,\r\nindeed of all that the modern studies of bacteriology have presented\r\nto us as antifermentives and microbicides. Roasted coffee in powder\r\nform gives good results if dusted over ulcers and gangrenous sores,\r\nrapidly improving their appearance and destroying the foetid odor. It\r\ncorrects the unhygienic properties of non-potable water and therefore\r\nenters into the army and navy ration of nearly all the nations of\r\nEurope. In epidemics of disease every physician should advise its\r\nuse in mild infusion as a regular beverage.\r\n\r\nDr. Luderitz, experimenting in the Hygienic Institute of Berlin,\r\nreported that no bacteria could resist the action of coffee in\r\ninfusion. He attributed this action not only to the tannin, which\r\nis present in high percentage, but principally to the empyreumatic\r\nsubstances formed by the roasting. The caffeine takes no part in this\r\naction. Dr. Luderitz exposed the coffee to the open air for six days\r\nand found it free from bacteria at the end of that time. Whatever may\r\nbe the explanation of its activity the fact remains that coffee is\r\nhighly antiseptic, and this should be kept in mind by physicians not\r\nonly because it is everywhere easily obtained and an infusion easily\r\nprepared, but because it in addition possesses the great advantage\r\nof being nontoxic.\r\n\r\nThe chemical analysis of the seed is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cellulose                                       34.000\r\n    Water                                           12.000\r\n    Fatty matters                             10 to 13.000\r\n    Glucose, dextrin, undetermined acid             15.500\r\n    Legumin, caffeine                               10.000\r\n    Chlorogenate of caffeine and potassa    3.500 to 5.000\r\n    Albuminoids                                      3.000\r\n    Caffeine, free                                    .800\r\n    Essential oil, solid                              .001\r\n    Essential oil,  liquid                            .002\r\n    Mineral substances                               6.697\r\n\r\n\r\nCaffeine, the only one of the ingredients that interests us, was\r\ndiscovered by Hunge in 1821 and recognized as an alkaloid by Herzog. It\r\nalso exists in tea, formerly known as \"theine\" which is now known\r\nto be identical with caffeine; both are expressed by the formula\r\nC_8_H_10_N_2_O_2_+H_2_O. It crystallizes in fine, silky needles,\r\nis colorless, odorless and slightly bitter.\r\n\r\nIt is considered a substitute for digitalis, especially valuable as\r\na diuretic and where cerebral anemia exists. Germain See values it\r\nas a preventive medicine, acting principally upon the heart and thus\r\npreventing fatigue; with this end in view he advises its use before\r\nlong marches, violent exercise and all conditions where the heart will\r\nbe called upon to do a greatly increased amount of work. Dose 0.25\r\ngram to 1 or 2 grams a day given by stomach or hypodermic injection.\r\n\r\nCaffeine is also useful in headache, neuralgia, and asthma and as a\r\ngeneral tonic. For the latter action it is best given in pill form,\r\n0.02-0.04 gram a day, with the extract of cinchona or other bitter\r\ntonic.\r\n\r\n\"Etoxy-caffeine,\" which is caffeine in which an atom of H has been\r\nreplaced by the C_2_H_5_O, exists as white, needle-like crystals,\r\nslightly soluble in water; it is narcotic and sedative to the\r\ncerebro-spinal system. In doses of 0.24 gram it is useful in headache.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--\"A small tree that reaches a height of 8-9°. It\r\ngrows readily in the province of Batangas without cultivation,\" Blanco.\r\n\r\nA small tree or shrub with leaves opposite, smooth, glossy, rich green,\r\noval, edges fluted. Flowers fragrant, white, growing in small clusters\r\nin the axils of the leaves. Calyx 4-5-toothed. Corolla short-tubed with\r\n4-5 spreading lobes of about the same length. Berry red, containing\r\ntwo plano-convex seeds enveloped in arils.\r\n\r\nThe plant is widely cultivated in gardens. It finds ideal conditions\r\nfor growth in some of the hilly and mountainous regions of Luzon,\r\nnotably in Benguet and Batangas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morinda citrifolia_, L.; variety: _bracteata_, Hoock, Jr.\r\n(_M. ligulata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bankundo_, _Pankundo_, _Bangkuro_, _Nino_, _Kulit_,\r\n_Tumbongaso_, _Lino_, _Mambog_, _Takpus_, Tag. and Vis.; _Taliantar_,\r\nPam.; _Apalot_, Iloc.; _Indian Mulberry_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--In the Philippines, as well as in India, the root of the\r\nplant is widely used as a red dye. As a medicine the Tamul physicians\r\nuse it in decoction to treat diarrhoea and dysentery. The fruit is\r\nemmenagogue and perhaps aperient. In Bombay the mashed leaves are\r\napplied to wounds and ulcers to hasten cicatrization; they also use\r\nthe decoction internally as a febrifuge and tonic, 10 grams to 500\r\nof water, a wineglassful twice a day.\r\n\r\nThe root bark contains a crystalline substance called by Anderson\r\n_morindin_, C_28_H_30_O_15_. It is a glucoside and exists in the form\r\nof yellow needles, soluble in alcohol and in cold water, insoluble\r\nin ether; dissolves in alkalies producing an orange-red color.\r\n\r\nThere is another species, _M. tinctoria_, Roxb.; _M. Royoc_, Blanco,\r\ncalled in Tagalog _Tumboung aso kapay_, the roots of which are used\r\nby the Filipinos for the same purposes as the leaves of the former\r\nspecies; the dose, 8 grams a day. The powder is also applied to ulcers\r\nand sores, especially those of gangrenous aspect.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree 11 or more feet high, branches\r\nopposite, quadrate at the extremities. Leaves opposite, oval, oblong,\r\nsmooth, entire, glabrous. Petioles very short, with 2 broad, lanceolate\r\nstipules curved outward. Flowers white, opposite the leaves, fixed on\r\nglobose, solitary receptacles from which spring the flowerets. Calyx\r\nproper, very short, monophyllous, a lanceolate leaflet springing from\r\nthe border. Corolla tubular, woolly inside about the middle, with 5\r\nlobules. Stamens 5, inserted on the walls of the corolla. Anthers thin,\r\nincumbent. Pistil somewhat longer than the corolla. Stigma cleft in\r\n2 laminæ. Fruit: the receptacle of the flowerets ripens to a globe\r\nbristling with the remains of the calyces, like a berry covered with\r\nmany smaller ones, each containing 2 monospermous, quadrangular seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_M. tinctoria_, Roxb., is a climbing shrub with leaves opposite,\r\novate, keeled; petioles very short; flower and fruit like the\r\nforegoing species.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In Luzon and, especially the M. tinctoria, in Malinta,\r\nCalauan and Tanauan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pæderia foetida_, L. (_P. sessiflora_, DC.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kantutan_, _Kantutæ_, Tag.; _Lilitan_, _Tæ-tæ_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The foetid odor of this plant has suggested both the\r\ntechnical and common names for it. The natives regard it as a cure\r\nfor rheumatism. The root is emetic. The leaves, boiled and mashed,\r\nare applied to the abdomen in retention of urine; the decoction of\r\nthe leaves is used for the same purpose and also has some reputation\r\nas a solvent for vesical calculus. For fever, cloths soaked in the\r\ndecoction are applied to the head, the same preparation being given\r\ninternally at the same time.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A slender, twining plant with leaves 3'\r\nby 1', opposite, oval, acute, entire, long petioles and caducous\r\nstipules. Flowers dark rose color, in compound axillary and terminal\r\ncymes. Calyx of 5 persistent lobules. Corolla tubular, pubescent,\r\n5 lobules. Stamens 5, free. Ovary inferior, flattened, 2 uniovulate\r\nlocules. Style with 2 stigma-bearing branches.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon, Mindanao, Cebu, Panay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eupatorium Ayapana_, Vent.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Aya-pana_, Sp.; _Ayapana_, _Apana_, Tag.; _Ayapan_,\r\nIndo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--A native plant of Brazil now naturalized and well known in the\r\nPhilippines and many other tropical countries; it is called by its\r\nBrazilian name, Aya-pana, more or less modified. The entire plant is\r\naromatic and its infusion has an agreeable, bitter taste. Its virtues\r\nhave been much exaggerated, but it is certainly a good stimulant,\r\ndiaphoretic and tonic. An infusion, 30 grams of the leaves to 1 liter\r\nof water, is given in dyspepsia, a small cup after each meal. In the\r\nisland of Mauritius this infusion was widely used as a stimulant and\r\naromatic in the cholera epidemics of 1854 and 1856.\r\n\r\nIt is used internally and locally for the bites of venomous snakes\r\nand insects. The leaf-juice is a good application for foul ulcers,\r\nas is also the decoction of the entire plant. \"It appears probable\r\nthat this plant has fallen into unmerited neglect.\"--Pharm. of India.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--An aromatic plant 3° high, leaves opposite,\r\nsessile, coherent at the base, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers\r\nin racemose panicles. Common calyx cylindrical, of many imbricated,\r\nawl-shaped scales, the lower ones smaller; within are 20 or more\r\nhermaphrodite disk-flowers. Corollas are funnel-form, 5-lobed. Style a\r\nlittle longer than the stamens. Stigmas 2, long. Seed 1, quadrangular,\r\nwith simple, downy, sessile pappus. Receptacle nude.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in fields and gardens. Blooms in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blumea balsamifera_, DC. (_Conyza balsamifera_, L.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sambon_, Tag.; _Lakbandulan_, _Hamlibon_, _Lalakdan_,\r\n_Lakadbulan_, _Gintingintin_, _Gabuen_, _Ayoban_, _Alibun_, Vis.;\r\n_Sobsob_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--Sambon is a panacea among the Filipinos; its virtues are\r\nprodigious according to the ignorant natives who wear the leaves in\r\nthe hat or the \"salakod\" (rain hat), to prevent \"tabardillo\" (\"burning\r\nfever\"; tabardillo pintado = spotted fever). They use the decoction\r\nto bathe convalescents, and for rheumatism they vaporize it in an\r\nimprovised bath-cabinet consisting of a chair in which the patient sits\r\nenveloped in blankets that reach to the floor and retain the steam.\r\n\r\nThe hot infusion of the leaves is a good diaphoretic taken by the\r\nmouth, especially useful in catarrhal bronchitis, and prized as an\r\nexpectorant by the Chinese and Javanese. Furthermore it is stomachic,\r\nantispasmodic and emmenagogue.\r\n\r\nThe camphorous odor of the plant suggested to me its application as\r\nan antiseptic lotion for varicose ulcers and my results have been\r\nvery satisfactory. The infusion for internal use is 30 grams to the\r\nliter of water.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A woody plant 6-9° high. Leaves 1° long,\r\n3' wide, oblong, lanceolate, acutely serrate, rugose, soft, downy,\r\nwhitish. Flowers yellow in panicles. Involucre conical, of many\r\nlinear scales, enclosing 15 or more hermaphrodite disk-flowers and\r\nseveral pistillate ray-flowers. Hermaphrodite: corolla infundibuliform,\r\n5-toothed. Pistillate: corolla very minute, infundibuliform, obscurely\r\n4-toothed. One seed crowned with a simple hairy pappus.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows universally in the islands and is well known. Blooms\r\nin January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sphoeranthus Indicus_, L. (_S. hirtus_, Willd.; _S. mollis_, Roxb.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sambong-gala_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant seems to possess anthelmintic properties and for this\r\npurpose it is administered in powder, 2-4 grams with a little molasses\r\nor syrup. It is bitter and aromatic and is given in diseases of the\r\nstomach and intestines for its tonic and stimulant effect. The odor\r\nof the drug is transmitted to both urine and sweat. In India it is\r\nused in \"bilious diseases\" and to dissipate all sorts of tumors. The\r\nHindoos cook it with flour, lard and sugar and eat the mixture as\r\na tonic and to prevent gray hair and baldness. They also give the\r\nseed, fried in oil, as an aphrodisiac. The aqueous distillate is a\r\ngood preparation as it contains the active principle of the plant,\r\na yellow, viscid, essential oil.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant about 1° high, stem and branches\r\nbearing 3 serrate wings. Leaves premorse, lanceolate, decurrent,\r\ndowny. Flowers white, in a globose head, divided into 50 or more\r\ngroups each with its own calyx of 9 or 10 leaflets surrounding 2 or 3\r\nhermaphrodite, 5-toothed, campanulate flowers. Anthers 5, united. Style\r\n1, thick at extremity. Stigma none. Corolla of pistillate flowers very\r\nminute, with 3 obscure teeth. Stigma of 2 down-curved divisions. One\r\nseed, 4-angled, imbricated.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--The rice fields. Blooms in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spilanthes Acmella_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Hagonog_, Tag.; _Agonoy_, Sp.-Fil., Vis.(?); _Palunay_,\r\nPam.\r\n\r\nUses.--Some native herb-doctors use the root as a purgative, giving a\r\ndecoction of 4-8 grams to a cup of water. The infusion is used locally\r\nfor itch and psoriasis. Internally it has a diuretic effect and is\r\nreputed to be a solvent of vesical calculi. The leaf juice and the\r\nbruised leaves are applied to wounds and atonic ulcers. These leaves\r\nwith those of \"sambon\" and \"sampaloc\" (tamarind) are used to prepare\r\naromatic baths for convalescents, rheumatics and pregnant women.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant with stem drooping, square,\r\ngrooved, covered with drops of gum resin. Leaves opposite, cordate,\r\noval, lanceolate, serrate, 3 prominent nerves covered with short\r\ndown. Petioles short, grooved. Flowers yellow, in a sort of umbel,\r\nwith 3 or more flowerets on long peduncles. Common calyx, 9-11 narrow\r\nsepals, concave, fleshy, in 2 rows. Hermaphrodite disk-flowers 40 or\r\nmore. Corolla tubular, 5-toothed. Anthers longer than corolla. Pistil\r\nlonger than stamens. Style bifid. Pistillate flowers, 15 or more,\r\nforming the rays. Corolla monopetalous, 3-toothed. Style and stigma as\r\nin hermaphrodite flowers. Seeds of hermaphrodite flowers quadrangular,\r\ncrowned by one long awn, and the rudiment of another. Seeds of ray\r\nflowers small and sometimes flattened, 2 awns, of which one alone\r\nlengthens and becomes conspicuous. Receptacle covered with concave\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows along the shores of the sea and of rivers. It is very\r\nwell known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artemisia vulgaris_, L. (_A. Indica_, Willd.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Ka-María_, _Santa María_, _Tinisas_, Tag.; _Indian\r\nWormwood_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The native women use the infusion of its aromatic leaves to\r\ninduce menstruation. It is also used as an abortifacient, but is too\r\nmild a uterine stimulant to be reliable for that purpose. Its stomachic\r\nand tonic properties are common knowledge in the Philippines. The\r\nHindoos use it for those effects and as an antispasmodic in amenorrhoea\r\nand hysteria. Dr. Wight states that the leaves and tops are useful\r\nin nervous troubles resulting from debility and that a decoction of\r\nthem makes a good fomentation for phagedenic ulcers.\r\n\r\nThe infusion is prepared in the proportion of 10-30 grams of leaves\r\nto 1 liter of water and the powdered leaves are given in doses of\r\n4-8 grams; the aqueous extract 30-40 grams a day. For amenorrhoea\r\nthe drug is given daily for a week preceding the menstrual date.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 3° high, stem straight, woody, square\r\ntoward ends of branches. Leaves alternate, tomentose, decurrent,\r\ndivided in several places, medium lanceolate. Flowers straw-colored,\r\nin axillary and terminal, 1-ranked spikes. Common calyx cylindrical, 2\r\ncircles of oval, scarious leaflets around its border, 11 hermaphrodite\r\ndisk-flowers and about 5 pistillate ray-flowers. Hermaphrodite: Corolla\r\nbell-shaped, 5 obtuse teeth; stigmas 2, bent to the sides. Pistillate:\r\nCorolla diminutive, 5 toothlets; anther none; stigmas 2. Seeds of\r\nboth small and quadrate, smaller in the latter. Receptacle nude.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows throughout the islands and is well known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carthamus tinctorius_, L.\r\n\r\nNom.

Some use them internally in doses of 4 grams to cure\r\nicterus. The leaves coagulate milk. The seeds are purgative in dose of\r\n8-16 grams, bruised and taken in emulsion, or 15-30 grams in decoction.\r\n\r\nThe following is the chemical analysis of the plant:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Yellow coloring matter, soluble                26.1-36.0\r\n        Carthamic acid                                  0.3- 0.6\r\n        Extractive matter                               3.6- 6.5\r\n        Albumin                                         1.5- 8.0\r\n        Wax                                             0.6- 1.5\r\n        Cellulose, pectin                              38.4-56.0\r\n        Silica                                          1.0- 8.4\r\n        Oxide of iron, aluminum, oxide of manganese     0.4- 4.6\r\n\r\n                                                            (Salvetat.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 3° high, root gray and\r\nspindle-shaped. Stem straight, few branches. Leaves scattered,\r\nsessile, partially embracing the stem, lanceolate, serrate with\r\nhooked teeth. Flowers yellow, terminal in a sort of corymb. Common\r\ncalyx semiglobose, with imbricated scales, the border often bearing\r\nthorns; numerous hermaphrodite disk flowers, with corolla very\r\nlong, funnel-form, 5-toothed. Style longer than the stamens. Stigma\r\nbifid. Seed large, lacking pappus.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Cultivated in the gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUMBAGINEÆ.\r\n\r\nLeadwort Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plumbago Zeylanica_, L. (_P. viscosa_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sagdikit_, Tag.; _Bagbag_, _Talankaw_, Iloc.;\r\n_White-flowered Leadwort_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root is vesicant and is used by the natives for this\r\npurpose. (_P. rosea_, L., common in India, is more powerful. The\r\nPharmacopoeia of India states that both species are worthy of further\r\ninvestigation.) According to the Sanscrit authors it increases the\r\nappetite and is useful in dyspepsia, piles, dropsy, diarrhoea and\r\nskin diseases. The Filipinos use the infusion locally for itch with\r\ngood results. A favorite medicine of the Hindoos for flatulence is\r\nthe old recipe of Susrutas, composed of equal parts of the following\r\nsubstances in powder:\r\n\r\nLeadwort root, root of _Cissampelos Pareira_, _Picrorrhiza kurroa_,\r\n[6] _Aconitum heterophyllum_,1 and _Terminalia Chebula_ in dose of\r\n4 grams a day.\r\n\r\nDr. Oswald has employed the alcoholic tincture of leadwort in the\r\nintermittents, with satisfactory results, and claims that it is a\r\npowerful diaphoretic. [7] The mashed root is mixed with rice flour\r\nand made into a caustic paste to apply to buboes, destroy warts,\r\netc. Women also use the scraped root to induce abortion, introducing\r\nit through the vagina into the _os uteri_. This practice should be\r\nstrongly condemned on account of its dangerous consequences--metritis,\r\nperitonitis and often death.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of the root has been studied by Dulong. [8]\r\nIt includes a non-nitrogenous principle, plumbagin, existing in the\r\nform of orange-yellow needles, bitter, acrid, volatile, neutral,\r\nslightly soluble in cold water, more soluble in ether, alcohol and\r\nhot water. The aqueous solution becomes cherry-red on the addition of\r\nan alkali, which color is changed to yellow by acids. Basic acetate\r\nof lead causes the same color change.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Plant with stem declined, angular. Leaves\r\nlanceolate, entire, rather downy. Petioles at their base embrace\r\nthe stem. Flowers white, in axillary spikes. Individual involucres,\r\n3 oval leaflets, the lower larger. Calyx long, cleft almost to\r\nthe base in 5 lineal parts thickly set with small glands, exuding\r\na sticky gum. Corolla salver-shaped, the tube long, square, throat\r\nbare, limb divided into 5 obovate parts, ending in stylets. Stamens\r\n5, inserted near the base of the corolla, almost as long as the\r\ntube. Style a little shorter than the stamens. Stigma, 5 parts. One\r\nlong seed enclosed within the calyx, pentangular, covered with a\r\nmembranaceous skin.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In Tanauan (Batangas).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAPOTACEÆ.\r\n\r\nSapodilla Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Achras Sapota_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Chico_, Sp.-Fil.; _Tsiku_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The _chico_ is one of the popular fruits of the Philippines,\r\nmuch appreciated by Europeans as well as the natives. When not entirely\r\nripe it yields a resinous juice that sticks to the lips and affords a\r\ndisagreeable taste; but when once thoroughly ripe it has a slightly\r\nvinous, sweetish taste and is easily digested. Therapeutically its\r\nseeds are used as a diuretic, but large doses should be avoided as\r\nthey contain a small proportion of hydrocyanic acid. The proper dose\r\nis 5-6 mashed seeds in sweetened water. They contain, in addition to\r\nthe above, a fatty substance of the consistency of butter.\r\n\r\nThe trunk bark is tonic and febrifuge; Mr. Bernon [9] has isolated from\r\nit a crystalline alkaloid, _sapotine_, soluble in ether, chloroform\r\nor alcohol, but not in water; a large per cent. of _sapotanic acid_\r\nand two resins.\r\n\r\nThe trunk exudes, when incised, a milky resin, closely resembling\r\nguttapercha and possibly susceptible of the same uses.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Trees, about 11° high, with leaves lanceolate,\r\nkeeled, entire, glabrous. Flowers pure white, solitary or by twos,\r\nterminal, very long peduncles. Calyx, 6 sepals, 3 within the others,\r\ninferior persistent. Corolla jug-shaped, the border divided into 12\r\nparts, the 6 smaller ones alternating and within the others. Stamens\r\n6, inserted near the border of the inner petals and opposite the outer\r\ncircle. Filaments very short. Style long. Stigma obtuse, fruit globose,\r\nresembling a small pear, russet brown, crowned with the hardened\r\nstyle, more than 10 compartments, each containing a seed. Seed oval,\r\nflattened, joined to a central fleshy axis.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common all over the Archipelago. Blooms in April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimusops Elengi_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kabiki_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--Its flowers are fragrant and generally well known. The trunk\r\nbark is astringent, and in decoction is given by mouth for fevers\r\nand diarrhoea. Locally is used as an injection for blenorrhoea,\r\nas a gargle for sore throat or relaxed uvula, and a mouth wash to\r\nharden the gums. Horsfield states that the Javanese use it as a tonic\r\nand antiperiodic. In India an aqueous distillate is employed as a\r\nperfume and therapeutically as a stimulant. In Concan they chew the\r\ngreen fruit for toothache and to harden relaxed gums. The decoction\r\nof the green fruit serves the same purpose and besides is used to\r\nwash wounds and ulcers.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A large ornamental tree with leaves alternate,\r\noblong, coriaceous, green. Flowers small, straw-colored, star-shaped,\r\nvery fragrant. Calyx, 8 sepals. Corolla gamopetalous, 16 oblong,\r\nlanceolate divisions. Stamens 8, free, short, alternating with 8\r\npetaloid, conical, pubescent staminodia. Ovary free, many ovules. Fruit\r\nfleshy, oval, smooth, yellow when ripe, with one or several locules\r\naccording to the number of matured seeds. Seeds solitary, oblong,\r\nflattened.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Cultivated in the gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEACEÆ.\r\n\r\nOlive Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jasminum Sambac_, Aiton. (_Nyctanthes Sambac_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sampaga_, Tag.; _Sampaguitas_, Sp.-Fil.; _Arabian\r\nJasmin_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The flower is the most popular and beloved of any in the\r\nPhilippines (and is commonly referred to as the national flower). In\r\ndecoction it is used as an eye-wash in catarrhal conjunctivitis. In\r\nIndia the flowers and the leaves have a merited reputation as\r\na lactifuge; 2 handfuls of flowers bruised and applied without\r\nmoistening, once or twice a day, sometimes checks the secretion of\r\nthe milk within 24 hours, but generally 2 or 3 days are required for\r\na complete effect.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Stems scarcely climbing, flattened,\r\npubescent. Leaves opposite, cordate base, lanceolate-ovate,\r\nentire, glabrous. Flowers in small, close clusters, white,\r\nfragrant. Calyx-teeth 8-9, long and awl-shaped. Corolla, long tube,\r\n7-8 rounded lobes. Stamens 2. Style 1. Stigma cleft in 2 laminæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOCYNACEÆ.\r\n\r\nDogbane Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Allamanda cathartica_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--Not known.\r\n\r\nUses.--As this plant has no common name in the Philippines it is most\r\nprobable that the natives do not use it. The Portuguese introduced\r\nit into India from Brazil. A decoction of the leaves is purgative\r\nand is used in lead colic. The milky juice of the plant is emetic and\r\ncathartic in large doses, but simply laxative when given in doses of\r\n8 or 10 drops. On account of its possible violent cathartic action\r\ngreat prudence should be exercised in prescribing it.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A twining shrub with leaves in fours, bright\r\ngreen, oblong, covered with rough hairs. Flowers in compound spikes,\r\nyellow. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla 5-lobed, funnel-form. Stamens 5,\r\ninserted in throat of corolla, which above them is closed by a crown of\r\nhairs. Ovary 1-celled with 2 many-ovuled placentæ. Style cylindrical,\r\nterminating in a bilobulate cone. Capsule globular, about the size\r\nof a pea, black, coriaceous, thorny, bivalvate. Seeds numerous,\r\neach encircled by a broad membranous wing.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In Calauang and other parts of Luzon and Panay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thevetia nerifolia_, Suss. (_Cerbera Thevetia_, L. and Blanco)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Campanelo_, Sp.-Fil.; _Exile or Yellow Oleander_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This shrub is very common in gardens, well known by its pretty\r\nyellow, bell-shaped flowers. The trunk bark possesses antiperiodic\r\nproperties first described by Descourtilz and confirmed later by\r\nDr. G. Bidie and Dr. J. Short. Both the latter used the tincture\r\nin 10-15-drop doses 3 times a day. This tincture was prepared by\r\nmacerating for one week in 150 grams of alcohol 30 grams of fresh bark\r\nfinely divided. This preparation operates as an emetic and purgative\r\nin doses of 30-60 drops. It is evident that the plant possesses very\r\nactive, even poisonous properties and should be employed with great\r\ncaution. The decoction of the bark is given as an emetic and cathartic,\r\nbut very imprudently because there is no means of determining the\r\nquantity of active principle, shown by chemical analysis to be a\r\ndangerous product.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is very bitter and acrid. The seeds yield by expression\r\n35 to 41% oil (De Vry) and 57% when treated with benzol. It has\r\nan agreeable odor resembling that of sweet almonds, its density\r\nis 0.9148 at 25° and it is perfectly clear and transparent at that\r\ntemperature. At 15° it thickens and at 13° solidifies. According to\r\nOudemans it consists of 63% triolein and 37% tripalmin and tristearin;\r\nit is not poisonous. After expression De Vry obtained from the caked\r\nresidue 4% of a crystalline glucoside called by him _thevetin_. Blas,\r\nof the Academy of Medicine of Belgium, studied it later and described\r\nit as a white powder of small colorless scales, odorless, very bitter,\r\nsoluble at 14° in 122 parts of water, in alcohol, in crystallizable\r\nacetic acid, insoluble in ether; formula C_54_H_34_O_24_. Concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid dissolves it, producing a dark red color that changes to\r\ncherry red and then after several hours to violet. The color disappears\r\nif water be added. Boiled in acid solution the glucoside changes to\r\na new substance, _theveresin_ (C_48_H_70_O_17_), white, amorphous,\r\nslightly soluble in boiling water and in alcohol, insoluble in benzine\r\nor chloroform, soluble in alkalies, very bitter. Both substances are\r\nenergetic narcotic poisons; but the plant contains another even more\r\npowerful poison isolated by Warden, of Calcutta; it does not form\r\ncrystals, it is very bitter, freely soluble in water, and is turned\r\nyellow by sulphuric and nitric acids.\r\n\r\nThevetin and theveresin exercise a marked toxic effect on the\r\nheart. The former induces emetic and cathartic phenomena, trembling and\r\nprogressive weakness. The latter does not cause vomiting or diarrhoea,\r\nbut anæsthesia and rigidity of the limbs. Both poisons arrest the\r\nheart in systole. Injected hypodermically they are irritant, are\r\neliminated by the liver, but are not found in the urine.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub, about 10° high, with leaves\r\nnearly sessile, somewhat bunched at the ends of the branches and\r\noverlapping, lanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers about 2' long. Calyx\r\n5-toothed. Corolla straw-colored, cylindrical, very narrow below,\r\nbut the limb very large, spreading into 5 lobes with greenish,\r\nsuperimposed borders. Stamens 5, inserted in the throat, anthers\r\nlanceolate. Ovaries 2, united at base, free above, unilocular. Style\r\nsimple, enlarging at the base in a bilobed stigma. Fruit a fleshy\r\ndrupe resembling somewhat a small apple, the pit very hard, semilunar,\r\nflattened, with 4 compartments and as many solitary seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all gardens and on the seashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cerbera Odallam_, Gaertn. (_C. manghas_, Bl. & Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Toktok-kaló_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The milky juice of the plant is emetic and purgative. The\r\nchemist De Vry has isolated from it a poisonous alkaloid analogous to\r\n\"thevetin,\" which has just been considered. The seeds are likewise\r\nemetic and toxic. The Javanese call the fruit \"bimaro\" and affirm\r\nthat it possesses the same properties as \"datura.\" The bruised leaves\r\nare used locally for hepatic eruptions; the bark is used for the same\r\npurpose and is purgative.\r\n\r\nThe use of the plant is dangerous and is condemned by the Pharmacopoeia\r\nof India.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small shrub with forked branches. Leaves\r\n(overlapping) at ends of branches, lanceolate, entire,\r\nglabrous. Flowers in umbellate spikes. Calyx, 5 caducous\r\nlobules. Corolla white, twisted, cylindrical, with salver-shaped limb\r\ndivided in 5 rhomboid lobes, throat stellate and woolly. Stamens\r\n5. Filaments joined to the corolla, their ends thickened. Anthers\r\narrow-shaped. Ovary, 2 uniovulate locules. Style, same length as\r\nstamens. Stigma thick, conical, lobulate. Two drupes joined at the\r\nbase (one usually aborted), brown, large, oval, fleshy, with woody\r\nfibrous nut of a single flattened seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon. Blooms in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plumeria acutifolia_, Poir. (_P. alba_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Calachuche_, Sp.-Fil.; _Kalatsutsi_, _Kalasusi_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--This tree, beloved for its fragrant flowers, has a wide\r\ntherapeutic use in India and the Philippines. The bark is a bitter\r\nhydragogue cathartic and is given in decoction (5-10 grams to\r\n200 water) principally for dropsy; however the milky juice of the\r\ntrunk is preferable for this purpose, given in emulsion in doses of\r\n0.50-0.80 grams. The bark and the tips of the branches are given as\r\nan emmenagogue.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the root and of the trunk is an excellent remedy for\r\nblenorrhagia. The fresh bark is thoroughly comminuted and mixed\r\nwith sweetened water in the proportion of 60 grams to 4 liters;\r\nthis mixture is put in the sun for 4 days, and shaken from time to\r\ntime. It is then strained and given in doses of 4-5 glassfuls a day,\r\nat the same time with refreshing and emollient drinks, and prolonged\r\ntepid baths. At first this preparation exerts a purgative action, but\r\nlater acts upon the urinary organs, rapidly lessening the suppurative\r\nprocess in urethritis. The bark may also be associated with wine or\r\nbeer, in the proportion of 30 grains to the liter, the dose being\r\n2-4 small cupfuls a day and Dr. Grosourdy employs the extract of the\r\nbark in doses aggregating 0.20-0.25 gram a day, gradually increased\r\ntill at the end of a week 6 grams are taken daily (Dr. J. Amadeo).\r\n\r\nThe bruised leaves are applied locally to contusions to reduce the\r\nswelling. The juice is used externally as a rubefacient in rheumatic\r\naffections of the joints. In Concan they use a decoction of the root\r\nfor diarrhoea. The flower buds are chewed with _buyo_, for intermittent\r\nfever and the juice is applied locally for itch.\r\n\r\nPeckolt and Geuther isolated from the bark the glucoside, _agoniadin_\r\n(C_10_H_14_O_6_), which crystallizes in silky crystals fusible at\r\n155°, slightly soluble in water, alcohol, bisulphuret of carbon,\r\nether and benzine; soluble in nitric or sulphuric acids. In solution\r\nit is a golden yellow soon changing to green. Boiled in a dilute acid\r\nit splits into glucose and an undetermined substance. Oudeman obtained\r\n_plumieric_ acid (C_10_H_10_O_5_) from the milky juice deprived of its\r\nresin; the acid exists as microscopic, needle-like crystals, soluble\r\nin boiling water, alcohol and ether. It melts and decomposes at 130°.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 12-18° high, commonly cultivated\r\nfor ornament, well known in the islands, almost constantly bearing\r\nfragrant flowers, but rarely bearing fruit. Branches forked and\r\npeculiarly stumpy at the ends. Leaves alternate, broad lanceolate,\r\nentire, glabrous, the apices curved downward. Petioles short. Flowers\r\ncreamy white, light yellow in the throat. Calyx 5-toothed. Corolla\r\ntwisted, funnel-form, 5-lobed. Stamens 5, hidden in depths of the\r\ntube. Anthers dart- or arrow-formed. Style very short, thickened\r\nabove. Stigma 2-parted. Two horizontal, cylindrical and long follicles\r\njoined at their bases, with numerous seeds in hollow receptacles,\r\neach seed encircled by a wing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alstonia scholaris_, Br. (_Echites scholaris_, L. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Dita_, Tag.; _Dallopawen_, Iloc.; _Dita_ or _Alstonia\r\nTree_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The trunk bark is a febrifuge of great importance; it is\r\nofficial in the Pharmacopoeia of India and is widely used in the\r\nPhilippines. Personally I have had occasion to use it in several\r\ncases of malarial fever in the town of San Mateo near Manila. It is\r\nastringent, anthelmintic and antiperiodic, highly useful in chronic\r\ndiarrhoea and dysentery, not only for its astringent effects but for\r\nits tonic and restorative action. As a tonic it gives as good results\r\nas quinine. The dry powdered bark is given internally in wafers of\r\n20-30 centigrams. The infusion is prepared from 15 grams of the dry\r\ncomminuted bark to 300 of water. The dose is 30-60 grams 2 or 3 times\r\na day.\r\n\r\nAnother convenient preparation is the tincture, 75 grams of the\r\npowdered bark macerated 7 days in 500 grams of alcohol, shaking from\r\ntime to time. It is then filtered and enough alcohol added to make\r\nup the 500 cc. The dose is 4-8 grams a day.\r\n\r\nI have often used the following wine as a tonic for convalescents\r\nand patients suffering from general debility: Finely powdered bark,\r\n25 grams, muscatel or dry sherry one bottle; macerate a week, shaking\r\nevery day, and filter; dose 1/2 wineglass with equal parts water a\r\nfew minutes before each meal; children or very weak patients should\r\ntake it after eating; it should always be diluted.\r\n\r\nG. Grupe, a Manila pharmacist, treating the bark in 1883 by the\r\nsame process as that used in the preparation of quinine, obtained a\r\nbitter substance which he named _Ditaine_. According to Grupe Dr. Pina\r\nused this substance with great success in the treatment of malarial\r\nfevers, but neither Grupe's report nor Pina's experiment are of any\r\nscientific value, inasmuch as they have neglected to mention the doses\r\nin which the so-called alkaloid was employed. Later analyses by Hesse\r\nand Jobst revealed several principles: two alkaloids _ditamine_\r\n(C_16_H_19_NO_2_), soluble in ether; _Ditaine_ or _Echitamine_\r\n(C_22_H_28_NO_4_ + H_2_O) insoluble in ether, soluble in water;\r\nacetic acid and two amorphous substances dextrogyrous in ethereal\r\nsolution, one of them a resin, _Echicauchina_ (C_25_H_40_O_2_),\r\nthe other neutral, _Echiretin_ (C_35_H_56_O_2_); two crystallizable\r\nprinciples, dextrogyrous: _Echicerin_ (C_30_H_48_O_2_), _Echitein_\r\n(C_42_H_70_O_2_) and _Echitin_ (C_32_H_52_O_2_).\r\n\r\n_Ditaine_ is employed under the same circumstances and in the same\r\ndose as quinine. (The Hindoo writer, K. L. Dey, states that the plant\r\nyields an inferior quality of gutta-percha.)\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 50 or more feet high, the trunk\r\ncovered with small eminences resembling the scars of thorns. Branches\r\nradiating. Leaves radiating, 5, 6 or more, somewhat elliptical in form,\r\npointed at the apex. Petioles very short, with a pointed glandule on\r\nthe inner surface of the base. Flowers white, terminal, in umbellate\r\nracemes. Calyx very short, 5-toothed. Corolla twisted, tubular,\r\nthe limb 5-lobuled; throat open, encircled with down. Stamens 5,\r\nhidden within the throat and inserted on the tube. Filaments almost\r\nwanting. Anthers arrow-shaped. Style as long as the stamens, somewhat\r\nflattened, a scarcely visible line throughout its length. Stigma\r\nbifid, placed above a cylindrical zone, two follicles, 1° long and 1''\r\nthick, twisted like a string, containing the seeds in a row. Seeds\r\ncylindrical with a hairy awn at both ends.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In the forests of Luzon, especially in Batangas. Blooms\r\nin April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nerium odorum_, Aiton. (_N. oleander_, L. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Adelfa_, Sp.; _Baladri_, Tag.; _Sweet-scented Oleander_,\r\nEng.\r\n\r\nUses.--In the Philippines and in Spain this plant is well known to\r\nbe poisonous. The bark and the leaves of both the red-flowered and\r\nwhite-flowered varieties are boiled in cocoanut oil and the product\r\nis used for inunction in itch and other skin diseases. The bruised\r\nroot is a useful application for chancroids.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that the plant is poisonous, and indeed it is actively\r\nso in the tropics. It is now recognized as an energetic cardiac poison,\r\ncomparable with strophanthus, destined to play an important part in\r\ntherapeutics. Dr. Pouloux has made a study of the hydro-alcoholic\r\nextract of oleander and reports that it exerts a marked effect on the\r\nheart of frogs and rabbits, arresting them in systole. Where there\r\nis asystolia, such as we encounter in Bright's disease, without\r\ncompensation, it stimulates the heart and increases the urine in\r\nthe same manner as digitalis. No contraindications to its use are\r\nas yet known. It occasions no disagreeable symptoms and may be used\r\nmany days consecutively provided that the daily dose does not exceed\r\n10-15 centigrams.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous properties of the plant reside in two alkaloids\r\nisolated by Lukowsky from the leaves: _oleandrine_, extremely toxic\r\nand _pseudo-curarine_, as its name indicates, resembling curare in\r\nits action. Oleandrin is yellow, semicrystalline, soluble in water,\r\nalcohol, ether, chloroform and olive oil; fusible at 70-75° and\r\nchanging to a greenish oil. With HCl it forms a crystalline salt. It\r\nis a violent irritant of the mucous membranes and given internally it\r\ncauses emesis, diarrhoea, tetanic convulsions and death. It arrests\r\nthe cardiac movements in doses of 25 milligrams.\r\n\r\nLoiseleur-Deslongchamps experimented with the drug on his own person,\r\nusing a solution of 30 grams of the extract in 120 grams of wine. He\r\nbegan by taking three drops of this preparation four times a day,\r\nadding a drop to each dose every day, so that at the end of 12 days he\r\nwas taking 48 drops between 6 a. m. and 9 p. m. He reached a maximum\r\nof 64 drops a day but was forced to abandon his experiment at that\r\npoint on account of the unpleasant symptoms induced--loss of appetite,\r\ngreat weakness and muscular pains. His deduction was that the plant\r\ncontained a \"destructive and irritant principle.\" The experiment is\r\nof interest as demonstrating the maximum dose of the drug.\r\n\r\nThe active principles of the plant reside principally in the leaves\r\nand bark, but that they are abundantly present in other parts is\r\nproved by the death of several soldiers in Corsica from having eaten\r\nmeat roasted on a spit of oleander wood.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree, about 6° high. Leaves coriaceous,\r\nlanceolate, entire, glabrous. Flowers in terminal cymes, rose-color\r\nor white, single or double. Calyx 5-parted. Corolla 15 petals, the\r\ninner ones larger, disposed in 3 groups of 5. Stamens 10, fixed on\r\nreceptacle; filaments short. Style shorter than stamens. Two follicles,\r\nsharp-pointed, channeled, containing many imbricated seeds each with\r\nan awn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASCLEPIADACEÆ.\r\n\r\nMilkweed Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calotrops gigantea_, R. Br. (_Asclepias gigantea_, Willd. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kapal-kapal_, Tag.; _Swallow-Wort_, Eng.; _Mudar_,\r\nIndo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant is official in the Pharmacopoeia of India as\r\nan alterative, tonic, diaphoretic and emetic. J. J. Durant, having\r\nobserved that the natives used it for dysentery, experimented with it\r\nquite successfully in that disease. For adults he gradually raised\r\nthe dose from 1.10 to 4 grams, preferring smaller doses, however,\r\nfor mild cases. To children he prescribed 5-10 centigrams for each\r\nyear of age, 3 or 4 times a day. He remarked that the effects produced\r\nwere identical with those of ipecac administered in Brazilian fashion.\r\n\r\nThe part of the plant used is the dry root powdered. The usual dose\r\nis 15-50 centigrams 3 times a day, gradually increased; as an emetic\r\n2-4 grams.\r\n\r\nThe milky juice that escapes from the stem on the slightest abrasion\r\nis a drastic purgative, given commonly in dropsy, lumbricoids,\r\netc. Pledgets of cotton impregnated with the juice and packed in\r\nthe cavities of carious teeth, relieve toothache. It is applied\r\nlocally for various skin diseases, including syphilitic ulcers,\r\nand as a depilatory.\r\n\r\nSome races of India, such as the Rajputs of the districts of Allahab\r\nand of Khangor, use this milk-juice to poison their female infants whom\r\nthey are accustomed to regard as a vexatious burden. Therapeutically\r\nthey use it with honey, locally for sore throat.\r\n\r\nThe dry and powdered juice has been used in small doses as an\r\nalterative in the treatment of tuberculous leprosy, but it has not\r\ngiven results any better than many other drugs. In syphilis and\r\nmercurial cachexia its results are less doubtful.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Dr. Riddell obtained a sort of gutta-percha from the juice,\r\npreviously observed by Professor Redwood.\r\n\r\nMooden Sheriff states that the most active parts of the plant are the\r\nroot bark and the dried juice. He adds that the action of the juice is\r\nirregular and even dangerous, and that the bark is active in direct\r\nproportion to its age. He recommends that the inert tuberous layer\r\nof the bark be removed; prepared thus and powdered it is emetic in\r\ndoses of 2.50-3 grams.\r\n\r\nDuncan claims to have isolated from the bark an active principle\r\nwhich he called _mudarin_ from \"mudar,\" the Indian name of the\r\nplant. Following the same process Flückiger was unable to obtain\r\nthe substance, but did isolate 1 1/2% of an acrid resin, soluble in\r\nether and in alcohol; a mucilage and a bitter principle decolorized by\r\nchloroform and ether. It is probable that this is the active principle\r\nof the \"Calotropis gigantea.\"\r\n\r\nWarden and Waddell in 1881 isolated a substance crystallizable in\r\nnodular masses, with the formula C_17_H_28_O, analogous to the _albana_\r\nof gutta-percha.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree, 7-8° high, with straight stem,\r\nbranched and woody. Leaves sessile, opposite, cleft at the base,\r\noval, fleshy and woolly. Flowers lateral in simple umbels of 3 or\r\nmore flowerets. Calyx 5-cleft. Corolla monopetalous, 5 acute lobes,\r\nwhite, of rare and beautiful form. Nectaries 5, united throughout\r\ntheir length with the receptacle, their bases curved like the sides\r\nof the fleur de lis.\r\n\r\nAbove the nectaries is a 5-angled crown, the extremity of the\r\nreceptacle; in each angle a black anther. Two large follicles narrowed\r\nat the ends, woolly, the apex somewhat curved to one side, containing\r\nmany imbricated seeds, each with a tuft of long hairs.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Bauang, Taal and the volcanic island of Taal. Blossoms\r\nin April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tylophora asthmatica_, Wight. (_Asclepias asthmatica_, Roxb.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--(?)\r\n\r\nUses.--We are ignorant of the uses the Filipinos make of this plant. It\r\nis official in the Pharmacopoeia of India, the dry powdered leaf\r\nbeing the part employed, and its emetic, diaphoretic and expectorant\r\nproperties are well known in that country. Roxburgh has used the\r\nroot as an emetic and Anderson has employed it in the same manner as\r\nipecac in dysentery. Later the experience of Anderson was confirmed\r\nby O'Shaughnessy; though in place of the root he used the leaf,\r\nthe properties of which he regards as more certain and uniform.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Kirkpatrick has noted that the juice of the root and its\r\npowder are used by the natives of Mysore as an emetic, and adds that\r\nhe himself has used it for that purpose in a thousand cases with good\r\nresults. In its effect on dysentery as well as in its emetic effect it\r\nresembles ipecacuanha. He used the powder in doses of 1.20-1.80 gr.,\r\nto which he added 3-6 centigrams of tartar emetic when he desired\r\nto obtain an energetic emetic action. Like O'Shaughnessy he prefers\r\nthe powdered leaves. He considers it a good substitute for ipecac,\r\nnot only as an emetic, but as a remedy in asthma, dysentery and\r\ncatarrhal affections; Drs. Oswald and Mooden Sheriff have made the\r\nsame observations. The latter advises the administration of the juice\r\nof the plant for snake bites till vomiting is produced; then follow\r\nwith diffusible stimulants.\r\n\r\nThe emetic dose of the powdered leaves is 1.20-1.80 grams, the\r\nexpectorant and diaphoretic dose 10-30 centigrams. The concentrated\r\ninfusion of the leaves has an acrid taste. Tannic acid, the neutral\r\nacetate of lead and caustic potash produce with it an abundant\r\nprecipitate; the perchloride of iron colors it a dark green. Broughton,\r\nof Ootaemund (India), informed Hanbury and Flückiger, from whom we\r\nquote, that in 1872 he obtained a very small quantity of crystals from\r\na large quantity of leaves. He had not enough to make an analysis,\r\nbut injected a solution of the crystals into a dog with resulting\r\nvomiting and diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A vigorous plant with scandent stem 2-4 meters\r\nlong, the more recent growth woolly. Leaves opposite, entire, 5-12\r\ncentimeters long and 2-6 broad, oval or rounded. Petiole striated and\r\nshort. Flowers in umbelliferous cymes, compound, axillary, solitary and\r\nalternate, with woolly peduncles; hermaphrodite, regular, small, of a\r\npale green color inside and a light purple outside. Calyx gamosepalous,\r\nwith 5 lobules. Corolla gamopetalous, 5 oval, twisted lobules. Staminal\r\ncrown composed of 5 fleshy scales, joined to the staminal tube. Stamens\r\n5, inserted on the throat of the corolla, filaments joined to form\r\na very short tube with anthers straight, short and crowned by a\r\nmembranous bilocular appendix. The gynoecium consists of 2 unilocular\r\novaries each containing an indefinite number of ovules. Style with a\r\npentagonal stigma which bears in each angle a glandular body. Fruits\r\ncompound with two separate follicles, large, lanceolate, smooth,\r\n8-10 centimeters long and 5 in circumference. Each encloses a seed,\r\nhairy, albuminous with straight embryo and flattened cotyledons.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Mountains of San Mateo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGANIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nLogania Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strychnos Ignatii_, Berg. (_S. Philippensis_, Blanco; _Ignatia amara_,\r\nL.; _Ignatia Philippinea_, Lour.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Pepita Fruta_, Sp.-Fil.; _Pepita sa katbalongan_,\r\n_Kabalongan_, Tag., Pam.; _Pangaguason_, _Aguason_, _Kanlara_,\r\n_Mananaog_, _Dankagi_, _Katalonga_, _Igasud_, Vis.; _St. Ignatius\r\nBean_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The part of the plant employed is the seed, known in addition\r\nto the above common names as Pepita de San Ignacio and Pepita de\r\nCabalonga (for _katbolongan_). The natives handle it with the greatest\r\nimprudence, selling everywhere in the markets and in the Chinese\r\nshops, called _tindang-bayang_. It is not only a remedy among them,\r\nbut a sort of panacea, to which they attribute, among other virtues,\r\nthat of expelling evil spirits, simply worn about the neck. They grate\r\nit with a piece of earthen pot, mix with a little \"tuba\" vinegar and\r\napply it to the temples for headache. In bites of poisonous animals\r\nthey advise the application of the powdered seed over the wound, a\r\ntreatment which instead of being beneficent might easily be harmful\r\nto the patient. Before proceeding further, let us give the chemical\r\ncomposition of the seeds in order that their uses may be the better\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n_Strychnine_ is found in them in the proportion of 1/2-1 1/2 and\r\n_brucine_ 1/2%-1.4%. Flückiger and Hanbury by drying it over sulphuric\r\nacid and burning it with \"cal sòdica\" obtained 1.78% of nitrogen which\r\nrepresents 10% of albuminoid material. Strychnine and brucine exist\r\nin combination with igasuric acid discovered by Ludwig in 1873. The\r\nproportion of both the alkaloids is greater than in the seeds of nux\r\nvomica which contain only .25-.50% strychnine and .12-.05% brucin,\r\nalthough some authors give it as high as 1.01%. Strychnine can be\r\nobtained more readily and in larger proportions from St. Ignatius bean,\r\nbut it is generally obtained from nux vomica seeds on account of the\r\ncheapness of the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is more energetic than nux vomica and its use in medicine should\r\nbe condemned, preference, however, being given to the official\r\npreparations among which the best known is that commonly called\r\n\"Bitter Drops of Beaumé,\" of which the following is the composition:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Grated St. Ignatius' beans      500  grams.\r\n        Potassium carbonate               5 grams.\r\n        Soot (?)                          1 gram.\r\n        60% alcohol                   1,000 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacerate for 10 days, strain, express and filter. Dose, 1-16 drops\r\nin a little water or wine before each meal, for dyspepsia, anæmia,\r\nconvalescence from fevers, and other conditions in which a tonic is\r\nindicated. The indications for the use of this drug are the same as\r\nthose for nux vomica, keeping in mind the difference in dose.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--This plant grows in the deep forests of Samar\r\nand Masbate. That industrious and distinguished botanist, D. Regino\r\nGarcía, found it growing abundantly in Paranas, Island of Samar. It is\r\na robust vine, the trunk sometimes as thick as a man's thigh, climbing\r\nto the tops of the highest trees, apparently without preference as\r\nto its host, inasmuch as he saw it growing indifferently on _Ficus_,\r\n_Dipterocarpus_, _Litsaca_, etc. The seed which most interests us and\r\nis very common, is about the size of an olive, round and convex on one\r\nside, angulose and flattened on the other by being compressed with\r\nmany others within the fruit which contains 50 of them. Its surface\r\nis blackish with a gray-blue tinge. It is hard and corneous. Its\r\ntaste is extremely bitter.\r\n\r\nBranches opposite, smooth, the ends square. Leaves opposite,\r\noval, much pointed at the apex, entire, glabrous, with 3\r\nprominent nerves. Petioles very short. Flowers in panicles of many\r\nflowerets. Calyx inferior, 5-cleft, very short. Corolla 6-7 times\r\nlonger than the calyx, funnel-form, 5-lobed. Anthers 5, sessile, fixed\r\nin the throat of the corolla. Ovary very small. Style filiform, same\r\nlength as the stamens. Stigma truncate and thick. Drupe globose, often\r\noval, large, smooth, with thick, woody shell of a single compartment\r\ncontaining seeds as described above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORAGINACEÆ.\r\n\r\nBorage Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ehretia buxifolia_, Roxb. (_Carmonea heterophylla_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Mangit_, _Alangitngit_, Tag., Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The leaves dried in the shade are used in some Visayan\r\ntowns, in infusion to take the place of tea. The root is used by\r\nthe Hindoo physicians as an alterative. Dr. R. Ross has employed\r\nit for that purpose in a decoction of 60 grams to 500 cc. of water;\r\n60 cc. a day of this preparation gave him good results in secondary\r\nand constitutional syphilis. The Mohammedans of India consider the\r\nroot an antidote for vegetable poisons.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Small tree, 5-6° high, trunk straight. Leaves\r\nalternate or bunched in 3's or 4's at the nodes, lanceolate or\r\nspatulate, 3-toothed at apex, sometimes serrate toward the apex,\r\nset with short, stiff hairs. Petioles very short. Flowers axillary,\r\nin racemose panicles of a few flowers each. Common peduncle long,\r\npedicel short. Calyx free, bell-shaped, persistent, divided almost\r\nto base into 5 narrow, downy parts. Corolla bell-shaped, 5 oval\r\nlobules. Stamens 5. Ovary oval, within the flower. Style bifid. Stigmas\r\nsimple, truncate. Drupe globose, with hard, slightly furrowed putamen\r\nof 6 locules and solitary seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Malinta and many other parts of the Visayas. Blooms in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVOLVULACEÆ.\r\n\r\nConvolvulus Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ipomoea hederacea_, Jacq. (_I. nil_, Roth.; _Convolvulus nil_,\r\nL. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bulakan_, Tag.; _Kala-Danah_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant is not used as a medicine by the Filipinos, but\r\nis official in the Pharmacopoeia of India from which we copy its\r\nindications and official preparations.\r\n\r\nThe seed is the part employed, its cathartic properties being much\r\nlike those of jalap, though less energetic. An excellent substitute\r\nfor the latter is 2 or 3 grams of _kala-danah_ seeds in powder form,\r\nand no unpleasant effects attend its operation.\r\n\r\nThe official preparations are:\r\n\r\nExtract of Kaladana.--Dose, 30-60 centigrams in pill.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Powdered seeds              500 grams.\r\n        Alcohol                       2 liters.\r\n        Water                         4 1/2 liters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTincture of Kaladana.--Dose, 8-12 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Seeds                        75 grams.\r\n        Alcohol                     500 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompound Powder of Kaladana.--Dose, 3-3 1/2 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Powdered seeds              150 grams.\r\n        Acid tartrate of potassium  270 grams.\r\n        Powdered ginger              30 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last is an excellent substitute for the corresponding preparation\r\nof jalap.\r\n\r\nResin of Kaladana.--Dose, 30-50 centigrams. It is prepared like resin\r\nof jalap and is a safe and sure purgative. In mass it has a dark color,\r\nbut is gray when powdered. The odor is rather unpleasant, the taste\r\nsweetish and then acrid, nauseous, persistent, exciting the saliva and\r\nirritating the fauces. It was introduced into practice by Dr. G. Vidie.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A twiner with round, downy stem. Leaves\r\nheart-shaped, 3-lobed, the middle one broad-lanceolate, the lateral\r\nones rather rectangular with petioles of equal length with the\r\nleaves. Flowers large, rose color or pale blue, in axillary cymes of\r\n2 or 3 flowers each. Calyx, 5 long, downy parts. Corolla bell-shaped,\r\n5 faint lobes. Stamens 5, free, inserted in the corolla. Ovary free,\r\n3 biovulate locules. Style simple. Stigma trilobed. Seed vessels\r\nglobose with 3 locules each containing 2 seeds. Seeds convex on dorsum,\r\n1/2 cm. broad by 1 cm. long, testa black.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Manila. Blooms in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ipomoea pes-capræ_, Roth. (_Convolvulus pes-capræ_ L. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Katagkatag_, _Lagayray_, _Lampayog_, _Bagasoa_, _Kamigag_,\r\n_Daripay_, _Tagaray_, _Arodayday_, _Lambayog_, Tag., Vis.; _Lambayog_,\r\nIloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--The dry, powdered leaves are dusted over bruises and ulcers. The\r\nentire plant is very mucilaginous and the bruised fresh leaves are\r\napplied like poultices to cancers and ulcerating tumors. In India\r\nthe boiled leaves are applied locally in colic and in rheumatism;\r\nthe juice is given internally in dropsy as a diuretic, the pounded\r\nleaves at the same time serving as a poultice to the oedematous parts.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant that creeps extensively, the stem\r\ntaking root. Leaves with 2 well-marked lobules. Flowers rose-lilac\r\ncolor, in axillary panicles with long pedicels. Corolla very large,\r\nbell-shaped, the limb 5-angled and 5-nerved. Stamens 5, unequal in\r\nheight. Stigma globose, marked by a line; later it divides in two. Seed\r\nvessel ovate, 2-celled, in each cell 2 downy seeds convex on one side,\r\nangular on the other.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common on the seashore. Blooms in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ipomoea Turpethum_, R. Br. (_Convolvulus Turpethum_, L.;\r\n_C. maximus_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Albohol_, Sp.; _Turpeth Root_, _Indian Jalap_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root, known in the Philippines as \"turbita,\" is a purgative\r\nand is a component part of the tincture of jalap, one of the most\r\npositive and active of known cathartics. But turpeth root is seldom\r\nused alone, for its action is so uncertain that Sir W. O'Shaughnessy\r\npronounced the plant unworthy of a place in the Pharmacopoeia of\r\nIndia. The dose of the powder is 1-4 grams, the resin 40-50 cgms.,\r\nthe decoction of the root 4-12 grams. The active principle is a resin\r\nsoluble in ether and a glucoside, _turpethin_, C_34_H_56_O_16_.\r\n\r\nIn the east of India they make offerings of the flowers to the god\r\nShiva, and also put them to more practical use by applying them to\r\nthe head for neuralgic headache.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A vine with quadrangular stem. Leaves\r\nheart-shaped. Flowers axillary, numerous, in umbels. Calyx deeply\r\ncleft in 5 imbricated, ovate, fleshy parts. Corolla bell-shaped,\r\nfolded. Stamens 5, unequal in height. Ovary inserted on an\r\nhypogynous disk, with 2 biovulate compartments. Style same length as\r\nstamens. Stigma bilobulate, globose. Seed vessel square, encircled\r\nby calyx, 2 locules each with 2 seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Bauang and Pasig. Blooms in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLANACEÆ.\r\n\r\nNightshade Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Solanum nigrum_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Hierba mora_, Sp.; _Konty_, _Onty_, _Gamagamatisan_,\r\nTag.; _Lagpakon_, _Bolagtob_, _Lubilubi_, Vis.; _Kuty_, _Lubilubi_,\r\nBic.; _Black_ or _Common Nightshade_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--In the Philippines the entire plant is boiled and used for\r\nfood, with the precaution of pouring off the first 2 or 3 waters\r\nin which it is cooked, which contain an active principle capable of\r\ncausing such disagreeable symptoms as vertigo and nausea. A decoction\r\nof the leaves serves to cleanse chronic sores and in fact improves\r\ntheir condition; it is also used as a lotion for various forms of\r\ndermatitis, for erysipelas and old burns.\r\n\r\nThe plant is narcotic, antispasmodic and like belladonna it dilates\r\nthe pupil.\r\n\r\nIn India the decoction is given internally, 200-250 grams, for\r\nhypertrophy of the liver, and it is considered a good diuretic and\r\nalterative. For such uses they heat the above dose in a clay vessel\r\ntill the color changes from green to brown, when it is cooled and given\r\nnext day. Its action is diuretic and hydragogue-cathartic. Mooden\r\nSheriff recommends this treatment highly, and for dropsy further\r\nadvises the aqueous extract, 12 grams during the day divided into 3 or\r\n4 doses. Small doses of 30-60 grams of the decoction prepared as above\r\ndescribed, are of use in some chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 Defosses, of Besançon, obtained _solanine_ from the fruit,\r\npreviously isolated from the _S. Dulcamara_.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant about 2° high, stem straight,\r\n3-4-angled, with white dots. Leaves lanceolate. Flowers white,\r\nin 2-ranked racemes. Calyx inferior, 5 persistent teeth. Corolla,\r\n5 petals somewhat down-curved. Berry small, black when ripe.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Universally common. Blooms in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capsicum fastigiatum_, Bl. (_C. minimum_, Roxb.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Chili picante_, Sp.-Fil.; _Sili_, Tag.; _Capsicum_,\r\n_Red Pepper_, etc., Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit of this species of pepper plant is called _agí_\r\nin Cuba and Porto Rico; it is in common use as a condiment in the\r\nPhilippines. As a tonic and stimulant it is a useful article of food\r\nin hot countries where the digestive functions become sluggish. Used\r\nin moderation it prevents dyspepsia and consequent diarrhoea. It is\r\nused as a gargle for hoarseness, decreasing the congestion of the\r\nlarynx and vocal cords.\r\n\r\nGargle.--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tincture of capsicum      8 grams.\r\n        Water                   160 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMix.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently capsicum in powder, extract, or tincture, has been recommended\r\ninternally in the treatment of incipient hemorrhoids. The dose is\r\n.50 to 3 grams of the powder in pills or capsules; watery extract,\r\n0.30-0.60; tincture, 10-30 drops.\r\n\r\nThe _C. annuum_, L., and other varieties of red pepper serve the same\r\nuses as the above.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Stem 4-angled. Leaves opposite,\r\novate-lanceolate, entire. Petioles short. Flowers greenish-white\r\nin little clusters, drooping. Corolla wheel-shaped. Fruit straight,\r\nconical, slender, scarcely 1' long.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Universally common in the islands. Blooms at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Datura alba_, Nees. (_D. Metel_, Roxb. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Talamponay_, Tag., Pam.; _Takbibung_, Vis.; _Dhatura_,\r\nIndo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The applications of this species are identical with those of\r\n_D. Stramonium_ and it is official in the Pharmacopoeia of India. It\r\nis antispasmodic, narcotic and toxic, and is used quite commonly with\r\ncriminal intent in India and Indo-China. The cooked and bruised leaves\r\nmake an efficient poultice in articular rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of poisoning by \"dhatura\" are: dilatation of the pupil,\r\ngeneral malaise, dryness of the fauces and skin, hallucinations,\r\nrapid pulse, coma and death or permanent mania.\r\n\r\nThe dry leaf is smoked to abort asthma, and though its action is\r\nuncertain, it is one of the many remedies that should be tried,\r\nwhich though ineffective in one case may in another afford positive\r\nrelief in this distressing disease. Not more than 1.50 grams should\r\nbe smoked in one day and their use should be discontinued if any\r\nsymptom of intoxication supervenes. The Pharmacopoeia of India\r\ncontains a tincture made from 75 grams of the ground seeds and 500\r\ngrams of alcohol. Dr. Waring states that 20 drops of this tincture\r\nare equivalent to 6 centigrams of opium and that in some cases it has\r\ngiven him better narcotic results than the opium. The extract is made\r\nfrom 500 grams of the powdered seeds, 500 cc. ether, 500 cc. alcohol\r\nand 500 cc. water. Dose, 5-20 centigrams a day in 4 doses.\r\n\r\nThe _D. fastuosa_, L., known in Manila by the common name of\r\n_Talamponay na itim_, Tag., possesses the same properties as the\r\nabove. The Filipino physician, Sr. Zamora, successfully employed\r\na poultice of bruised leaves cooked in vinegar and applied to the\r\nforehead and backs of the hands to reduce the fever of tuberculous\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nNeither the leaves nor seeds of these two varieties of _Datura_ have\r\nbeen studied from a chemical standpoint, but there is little doubt\r\nthat the active principle is the _daturine_ (atropine and hyoscyamine)\r\nthat exists so abundantly in _D. Stramonium_.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Plant 5-6° high, with nodose branches,\r\nforked. Leaves ovate, angled, somewhat downy. Flowers large,\r\nwhite, axillary, solitary. Calyx tubular, 5-toothed. Corolla\r\nfunnel-shaped, the limb 5-angled and 5-folded. Stamens 5, same length\r\nas calyx. Anthers long, flattened. Stigma thick, oblong, divisible in\r\n2 leaves. Seed vessel globose, thorny, 4-valved over the base of the\r\ncalyx. Seeds numerous, flattened, kidney-shaped. (Resembles closely\r\nthe common Jamestown Weed of America, though much taller with much\r\nlarger flowers.)\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common on the shores of the sea. The _D. fastuosa_ is\r\ndifferentiated by its violet flowers and double corolla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nicotiana Tabacum, L._\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tabaco_, Sp.; _Tobacco_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--Tobacco is a powerful sedative and antispasmodic, but owing\r\nto the accidents it may give rise to, its use in therapeutics\r\nis very limited. Like all the active Solanaceæ it is effective\r\nagainst neuralgia and spasm of the muscular tissues and is therefore\r\nindicated in strangulated hernia and in intestinal obstruction. In\r\nthese conditions the infusion of 1-5 grams of the dried leaf to\r\n250 grams of water is given by enema. Trousseau advises non-smokers\r\nwho suffer from chronic constipation to smoke a cigarette fasting,\r\na practice which, according to him, stimulates defecation. For the\r\nsame condition the people of southern India are accustomed to apply\r\na poultice of the bruised leaves to the anal region.\r\n\r\nTobacco has been used by enema to combat tetanus; Dr. Lesth, of\r\nthe General Hospital for Europeans, Bombay, claims to have obtained\r\nexcellent results by applying a poultice over the entire length of\r\nthe spinal column. Dr. Dymock has confirmed this practice.\r\n\r\nA decoction of the leaves is used as a lotion to destroy \"pediculi\r\ncapitis and pubis,\" and to wash gangrenous ulcers.\r\n\r\nThe daily increasing practice of smoking, like all other subjects,\r\ndivides mankind into two camps, one for and one against the habit. Both\r\nparties exaggerate their arguments. The abuse of the plant without\r\ndoubt sets up disturbances of the digestion, the heart and the\r\nnervous system. It is furthermore positive that persons of a certain\r\ndisposition and with certain ailments are injured by even a moderate\r\nuse of tobacco. The above facts serve as arms for the opponents of\r\nthe habit; the robust who smoke and drink to excess and meet with\r\nan accidental death on a railroad or from an acute disease that\r\novertakes them in the midst of perfect health, serve as arguments for\r\nthe defenders, to prove the innocence of the custom. The antiseptic\r\nqualities of the smoke and of the entire plant also lend the smoker\r\na defensive argument, as he may uphold the habit as hygienic and\r\nhighly useful in preventing microbic infection. The antiseptic power\r\nof tobacco smoke is undoubted, but it is intolerable that a physician\r\nunder the pretext of avoiding self infection should enter the house\r\nof his patient and continue smoking at the bedside.\r\n\r\nChronic nicotine poisoning is the result of a gradual intoxication\r\nby the absorption of the active principle of tobacco, the alkaloid\r\nnicotine. Excessive smoking conduces to nicotism, more common in\r\nEurope than in the tropics, because the natives of Europe smoke the\r\npipe and being confined in closed dwellings, breathe continuously an\r\natmosphere of smoke; in the Philippines, on the contrary, the pipe is\r\nalmost unknown and owing to the nature of the dwellings the smoking\r\nis carried on practically in the open air. An injurious practice of\r\nthe Filipino smokers is that of \"swallowing the smoke,\" and this is a\r\nfitting point to call attention to an error of Dujardin-Beaumetz, who\r\nstates that \"in those who habitually swallow the smoke the nicotine\r\nacts directly upon the stomach.\" The expression \"swallow smoke\"\r\n(tragar el humo) does not mean to force it into the stomach by an\r\nact of deglutition, and I am sure no one attempts to dispose of it\r\nin that way; but to inspire or breath it into the air passages. It\r\nis evident that this latter habit does not involve the stomach, but\r\nthose who practice it expose themselves more to nicotism than those\r\nwho keep the smoke in the mouth or expel it through the nose.\r\n\r\nThe first cigar causes symptoms familiar to nearly everybody;\r\ndizziness, malaise, cold sweat, vomiting, diarrhoea, dilatation of\r\nthe pupils and rapid heart action--an acute intoxication. Chronic\r\nintoxication or nicotism manifests itself by disturbances of digestion,\r\nvision and especially circulation. It has been assigned as one of the\r\ncauses of early atheroma and of angina pectoris. It should therefore\r\nbe proscribed in persons who present symptoms of gastro-intestinal\r\nor of heart disease, and in every patient who complains of slight\r\nprecordial pains, commonly attributed to flatus, but in reality\r\ncardiac neuralgia, a fugitive symptom announcing the possibility of\r\nthat grave accident, angina pectoris, capable of ending the life of\r\nthe patient with one stroke.\r\n\r\nNicotine (C_10_H_14_N_2_) is an oleaginous liquid heavier than\r\nwater, colorless, changing to dark yellow on contact with the\r\nair. _Nicotianin_ or \"camphor of tobacco\" is another substance\r\nfound in the leaves, crystalline, tasteless, with an odor resembling\r\ntobacco. Nicotinic acid is a product of the combustion of nicotine.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The tobacco plant is so familiar to all\r\nAmericans that its description here would be superfluous. It grows\r\nin all parts of the islands, the best qualities being cultivated in\r\nthe northern provinces of Luzon, especially Cagayan and La Isabela.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCROPHULARIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nFigwort Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limnophila menthastrum,_ Benth. (_Tala odorata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tala_, _Taramhampam_, Tag.; _Talatala_, Pam.; _Taratara_,\r\nIloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--An infusion of the leaves is given as a diuretic and digestive\r\ntonic. The plant is aromatic. It is seldom used, but is given for\r\nthe same troubles and in the same doses as chamomile and _Eupatorium\r\nAyapana_.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 1° high, with leaves opposite,\r\nlanceolate, ovate, serrate, hairy, many small pits on the\r\nlower face. Flowers rose color, solitary, sessile. Calyx, 5 sharp\r\nteeth. Corolla tubular, curved, compressed, downy within, limb cleft in\r\n4 unequal lobes. Stamens didynamous. Ovary conical. Style shorter than\r\nthe stamens. Stigma 3-lobuled. Seed vessel, 2 multiovulate chambers.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Known universally. Blooms in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIGNONIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nBignonia Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oroxylum Indicum_, Vent.

Vulg.--_Pinkapinkahan_, _Pinkapinka_, _Taghilaw_, _Abangabang_,\r\nTag.; _Abangabang_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The Hindoos consider the trunk bark an astringent and tonic\r\nand use it commonly in diarrhoea and dysentery. In Bombay it has a\r\nwide use in veterinary practice as an application for the sore backs\r\nof the domestic cattle. Sarangadhara recommends for diarrhoea and\r\ndysentery the infusion of the roasted bark mixed with infusion of\r\n_Bombax malabaricum_.\r\n\r\nDr. Evers experimented with the powder and an infusion of the bark\r\nobtaining a strong diaphoretic action. He obtained the same effect\r\nwith baths containing the bark and reported successful results in thus\r\ntreating 24 cases of rheumatism. The dose of the powder was 0.30-1 gram\r\na day in 3 doses; the infusion (30 grams bark to 300 boiling water),\r\n90 grams a day in 3 doses. Combined with opium it had more pronounced\r\ndiaphoretic effects than the compounds of opium and ipecac. The plant\r\npossesses no febrifuge properties.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 5-6 meters high, trunk straight,\r\nhollow, the hollow space containing many thin partitions covered with\r\nsmall points; branches opposite. Leaves 4 times odd pinnate. Leaflets\r\nobliquely ovate, acute, entire, glabrous. Flowers in racemes with\r\nlong, primary peduncles, large, fleshy, lurid, violet color, odor\r\nmawkish. Calyx inferior, cylindrical, monophyllous, entire. Corolla\r\nmuch longer than calyx, fleshy, bell-shaped, 5-lobed. Stamens 5, all\r\nfertile, fixed on the corolla, nearly equal in height. Style longer\r\nthan stamens, flattened. Stigma cleft in 2 flat leaves. Silique or\r\npod about 3° long and 2' wide, flattened, borders grooved and curved\r\ndownward, containing a great number of seeds encircled by a broad,\r\nflat, imbricated wing.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in many parts of Luzon, in Mindanao, Cebú and Paragua.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEDALIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nPedalium Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sesamum Indicum_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Ajonjoli_, Sp.; _Lingá_, Tag.; _Longá_, Vis.; _Langis_,\r\nPam.; _Sesamé_, Indo-Eng. (_Benné Oil_, _Til Oil_, _Jinjili Oil_.)\r\n\r\nUses.--The leaves are emollient and in the Philippines, India and\r\nthe Southern States of North America they are commonly used to make\r\npoultices, as a substitute for linseed.\r\n\r\nThe decoction is prescribed internally as an emmenagogue and demulcent\r\nand externally as a lotion. It has the reputation of stimulating the\r\ngrowth of the hair and is used for this purpose quite commonly by\r\nthe women of India.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are emollient, laxative, diuretic and emmenagogue; they\r\ncontain an oil to which we shall refer presently. In some countries\r\nthey form an article of diet; in the Philippines they are much\r\nused as a condiment. Waring reports good results in amenorrhoea,\r\nadding a handful of the bruised seeds to a hot sitz-bath. Two or\r\n3 dessert-spoonfuls of the seeds eaten fasting and washed down\r\nwith a glass of water, are very efficient in chronic constipation,\r\nboth by their mechanical effect and the oil they contain; being\r\nnon-irritant they are especially indicated in cases of constipation\r\nwith hemorrhoids.\r\n\r\nThe seeds contain up to 45% of oil known in the Philippines under the\r\nname of _lana_, an Ilocano word meaning \"oil.\" It is bright yellow,\r\nviscid, does not easily become rancid and is used for illuminating\r\npurposes in some Philippine provinces. In Japan and among the poor\r\nof India it serves as a food; in the latter country it is also very\r\ncommonly used as a cosmetic, perfumed with various essences and used\r\nto anoint the hair and the body after the bath. In America it is given\r\nin place of castor oil in doses of 30-60 grams. In pharmacy it may be\r\nproperly substituted for olive oil, especially in Linimentum Calcis\r\nprepared for burns.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 2-4° high, stem straight, square,\r\ngrooved. Leaves trifoliate. Leaflets lanceolate, serrate, slightly\r\ndowny. Common petiole long; secondary petiole very short. Flowers\r\npinkish white, in spikes, each flower bearing 2 small glands. Calyx\r\nwith 2 bracts at the base, top-shaped, monophyllous, 5 lanceolate\r\nteeth. Corolla large, 5-lobed, bell-shaped, expanded in the middle\r\nwhere it is spattered with small spots. Stamens didynamous. Anthers\r\nlong. Ovary downy, quadrangular. Style same length as stamens. Stigma\r\nbifid. Seed vessel quadrangular, elongated, 4 opposite grooves,\r\n4 chambers each containing many small ovoid seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Universal.

Vulg.--_Diliwariw_, _Dolo-ariw_, _Tinglog_, _Lagiwlagiw_, Tag.;\r\n_Titiw_, Vis.; _Dulawari_, Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--We are not familiar with the medicinal uses of this plant in\r\nthe Philippines, but believe that its sole use is in the soap-making\r\nindustry; the ash of the plant is rich in soda and potash salts and\r\nlye is prepared from it.\r\n\r\nIn Goa the leaves, rich in mucilage, are used locally in fomentations\r\nfor rheumatism and neuralgia. Rheede mentions as useful the application\r\nof the bruised sprouts to snake bites. Bontius attributes expectorant\r\nproperties to the plant. The natives of Siam and Cochin China use it\r\nas a cordial and as a medicine for paralysis and asthma.\r\n\r\nIn Concan the sweetened decoction of the plant with a little cumin\r\nseed is given for dyspepsia with pyrosis.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant about 3° high, stem straight, beset\r\nwith sharp eminences. Leaves opposite, membranaceous, lanceolate,\r\npinnatifid, large teeth ending in prickles. Petioles very short, 2\r\nthorns at the base. Flowers purplish white in spikes. Calyx double;\r\nthe outer one of 2 parts, the inner 4. Corolla bell-shaped, lower\r\nlip broad, keeled, fleshy, notched above. Upper lip wanting, a notch\r\nin its place. Stamens 4, didynamous. Ovary superior, conical. Style\r\nof equal length with stamens. Stigma bifid. Seed vessels 2-celled,\r\neach cell with 2 heart-shaped, flattened, rough seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in regions inundated by salt water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barleria Prionitis, L._ (_Barreliera Prionitis_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kokongmanok_, _Kulanta_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant is not used medicinally in the Philippines. The\r\nnatives of Bombay are accustomed to use its juice to anoint the soles\r\nof their feet during the rainy season in order to toughen the skin\r\nand prevent fissures due to prolonged maceration.\r\n\r\nThe leaf juice is bitter and acid; it is a favorite with the natives\r\nof India in the treatment of the catarrhal fevers common among their\r\nchildren, administered in doses of 2 tablespoonfuls a day mixed with\r\nsweetened water.\r\n\r\nIn Concan the dry bark is given for whooping-cough and the juice of the\r\nfresh bark in doses of 2 \"tolas\" (7.60 grams) for anasarca. Dr. Bidie\r\nstates that the action is diaphoretic and expectorant.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 2-3° high, stem creeping, the ends\r\nrising; enlarged at the joints, glabrous. Leaves smooth, opposite,\r\nlanceolate, finely serrate, fringed, somewhat downy below, glabrous\r\nabove. Petioles short, 4 axillary spines. Flowers straw-color,\r\naxillary, sessile, solitary. Calyx deeply cleft in 4 parts, ovate,\r\nending in spines. Corolla funnel-shaped, tube short, throat nude,\r\nlimb 5-lobed. Stamens 4, didynamous. Ovary 2-celled. Style same length\r\nas stamens. Seed-vessel ovate, flattened and sharp-pointed, 2-celled,\r\neach cell with a flat, heart-shaped seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In Guadalupe, Mandaloyon and San Juan del Monte. Blooms\r\nin April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Justicia Gendarussa_, L. (_Gandarussa vulgaris_, Nees.; _Dianthera\r\nsubserrata_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kapanitulot_, Tag.; _Bunlaw_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--In the Philippines this plant has the same applications as\r\nthe _Lagundi_ or _Vitex_, soon to be described. In India they give a\r\ndecoction of the leaves for chronic rheumatism, the action probably\r\nbeing diaphoretic. The juice is employed for the coughs of childhood\r\nand externally as a resolvent for enlarged cervical glands. The bark\r\nof the young branches has a purplish color; in Java it is considered\r\na good emetic.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub 5-6° high, stem straight, branches\r\nsmooth, obscurely 4-angled. Stems and leaves violet color, emitting\r\na disagreeable odor (Blanco). Leaves opposite, lanceolate, acute,\r\nglabrous, obtusely serrate. Flowers terminal, white-green, in\r\nracemes of 3 sessile flowers with lanceolate bracts. Calyx, 5 long\r\nteeth. Corolla, short tube, 2-lipped, upper lip notched, lower lip\r\nbroad with palate, ending in 3 lobules. Seed vessel with 4 seeds in\r\nits lower part.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon, Mindanao, Panay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adhatoda vasica_, Nees. (_Justicia Adhatoda_, L.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--(?)\r\n\r\nUses.--The Filipinos are but slightly familiar with this plant and it\r\nhas no place in their therapeutical armamentarium. In India, however,\r\nit is very common and enjoys much reputation in the treatment of\r\ncatarrhs, the grip, asthma and non-febrile, especially chronic,\r\nbronchial affections. The flowers, leaves and roots, but especially\r\nthe flowers, possess antispasmodic properties and are prescribed\r\nin certain forms of asthma; they are bitter and slightly aromatic,\r\nand are given in infusion or electuary.\r\n\r\nDrs. Jackson and Dott have testified from their own experience to\r\nthe usefulness of the drug in chronic bronchitis, asthma and afebrile\r\ncatarrh. Dr. Watt states that the natives of Bengal find relief for\r\nasthma in smoking the leaves. In Bombay its expectorant action is\r\ncommonly known and its juice is used, mixed with borax and honey.\r\n\r\nThe dose of the aqueous extract made by evaporating the juice of the\r\nleaves, is .25-1 gram. The tincture is preferable, made by dissolving\r\nthis extract in alcohol; dose 2-4 grams. Its efficiency is increased\r\nby the addition of pepper seeds (Waring). The Sanscrit writers\r\nrecommend for cough, 3.80 grams of the leaf juice with honey. \"It is\r\nvery desirable that further trials be made to test the value of this\r\nremedy.\"--Pharmacopoeia of India.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub with straight, smooth, ashy-gray\r\ntrunk. Branches of same color but smoother. Leaves opposite,\r\nlanceolate, acute, smooth on both faces, 12-15 cm. long by 3-4 broad,\r\npetioles short. Flowers irregular and hermaphrodite in axillary spikes\r\nwith long peduncles, opposite, large, white, covered with rusty spots,\r\nthe lower part of the 2 lips purple. Calyx gamosepalous, regular,\r\nfive deep clefts. Corolla gamopetalous, irregular, short tube, limb\r\n2-lipped, the lower lip ending in a spur. Ovary free, 2-celled, each\r\ncell containing 2 ovules. Style filiform, long, inserted in a sort of\r\ncanal formed by the upper lip of the corolla. Stigma bilobulate. Seed\r\nvessel depressed, 4 flattened, lenticular seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon and Panay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rhinacanthus communis_, Nees. (_Justicia nasuta_, L.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tagaktagak_, Tag.; _Nagamulli_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The plant has much reputation in India in the treatment of skin\r\ndiseases, and indeed its efficiency is great in the stubborn _Tinea\r\ncircinata tropica_, known throughout the Orient as \"dhobie-itch.\" In\r\nthis disease it is applied for several days to the affected part\r\nin the form of a paste composed of the bruised leaves, the juice of\r\nthe leaves and lemon juice. The fresh root also may be employed. The\r\nHindoo physicians state that the root decoction in milk is aphrodisiac;\r\nthe root is also regarded as an antidote for the bite of the \"cobra\r\nda cabelho,\" but its virtue is purely imaginary. Of late years the\r\nplant has been used in Europe under the name of \"tong-pang-chong,\"\r\nto treat chronic eczema.\r\n\r\nLiborius made an analysis of the root in the laboratory of Dorpat,\r\nseparating 13.51% ash and 1.87% _rhinocanthin_, as well as other\r\ningredients. Rhinocanthin (C_14_H_18_O_4_) is supposed to be the active\r\nprinciple of the root. It is analogous to quinon and resembles in many\r\nparticulars chrysophanic and frangulic acids. It forms a resinous,\r\namorphous mass, cherry red, odorless and tasteless, slightly soluble in\r\nwater, forming a mildly alkaline solution in alcohol. It does not yield\r\nglucose when boiled with dilute hydrochloric acid. Liborius believes\r\nthat it exists only in the intercellular spaces of the \"root bark.\"\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub, about 4° high, stem ash-colored,\r\nno spines. Leaves lanceolate, undulate, downy. Flowers white in\r\nspikes. Calyx gamosepalous, 5-toothed. Corolla long, filiform, limb\r\n4-lobed, the 3 lower lobes ovate, the upper pointed. Stamens 2. Ovary\r\nfree, 2 biovulate locules. Style simple. Stigma bifid. Seed vessel\r\nclub-shaped, 4 seeds in the upper part.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in the gardens of Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERBENACEÆ.\r\n\r\nVervain Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lippia nodiflora_, Rich. (_Verbena nodiflora_, L.; _V. capitata_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tsatsatsatsahan_, _Chachachachahan_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The Filipinos drink an infusion of the leaves in place of tea,\r\nthe long Tagalog name meaning \"resembling tea.\" In India they drink\r\nthe hot infusion to aid digestion. In some places the decoction of the\r\nleaves is given internally as an emollient and diuretic for gonorrhoea.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small plant with creeping stem taking root\r\nwhere it touches the ground, obscurely angular, covered with short\r\ndown. Leaves opposite, smooth, clasping the stem, inversely ovate,\r\nserrate only above, slightly downy. Flowers white, slightly purplish,\r\naxillary on a common peduncle, in a rough conical head. Corolla\r\nsomewhat bowed, funnel-form, gaping, throat narrow, limb 4-lobed,\r\none lobe shorter than the rest. Stamens 4, 2 longer. Filament almost\r\nwanting. Anthers 4, fertile. Ovary superior, style very short. Stigma\r\nsemi-globose. Fruit, 2 seeds covered by the pellicle of the ovary.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in the rice fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tectona grandis_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Teca_, Sp.; _Tikla_, Tag.; _Dalondón_, _Yate_, _Kalayati_,\r\nVis.; _Teak Tree_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The powdered wood made into a paste with water is undoubtedly a\r\nuseful application in acute dermatitis, especially that due to contact\r\nwith the caustic oleo-resin of the cashew nut (_Anacardium_). A\r\ndecoction of the powder gives good results as a gargle for aphthæ,\r\ngingivitis, and other inflammations within the buccal cavity. In India\r\nthey give internally 6-12 grams as a vermifuge, and for dyspepsia with\r\n\"heartburn.\"\r\n\r\nThe flowers are diuretic according to Endlicher; the bark is\r\nastringent; the leaves and the seeds are purgative, the latter\r\nyielding an oil which they use in India to stimulate the growth of\r\nthe hair. Gibson considers the seeds diuretic and quotes two cases\r\nwhere abundant diuresis immediately followed by the application of a\r\npoultice of the bruised seeds over the pubis. In Concan they make a\r\nsort of extract from the wood and apply it to the yoke sores of the\r\ncattle to prevent the growth of maggots. This disinfectant action\r\nmarks the plant as worthy of further experiment.\r\n\r\nRumphius is authority for the statement that the infusion of the leaves\r\nis used in cholera. The Chinese make vessels of the wood to preserve\r\ntheir drinking water at sea; the first and second waters are bitter\r\nand are thrown away, but after that the water has no disagreeable\r\ntaste and is said to aid digestion.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the wood was poisonous because at one time\r\nseveral workmen died from the effects of wounds caused by splinters of\r\nthe wood, but the statement has not been confirmed by later cases and\r\nthe deaths were most probably due to a septic infection independent\r\nof the chemical composition of the splinters.\r\n\r\nR. Romanis has extracted a resin from the wood by alcohol; it is soft,\r\nand on distillation yields a crystalline body called by the author\r\n_tectoquinon_ (C_18_H_10_O_2_), on account of its resemblance to\r\nthe quinons. It melts at 171° and volatilizes slightly at ordinary\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree with leaves almost round, oval,\r\nentire, 30-60 centimeters by 20-40, the under surface covered\r\nwith hoary down. Petioles very short, flattened. Flowers in\r\npanicles. Primary peduncle square. Calyx inferior, bell-shaped,\r\nvery large when ripe, 5-cleft. Corolla white, longer than calyx,\r\ncovered with a mealy substance, bell-shaped, 5-lobed. Stamens 5 or 6,\r\ninserted in the corolla. Filaments flattened, somewhat longer than the\r\ncorolla. Anthers semi-globose, a yellow zone below and a black circle\r\nabove. Ovary free, rounded, 4 locules each with 1 seed. Style same\r\nlength as stamens. Stigma bilobulate. Drupe globose, woolly, spongy,\r\ndepressed, covered by the membranous inflated calyx; contains one nut,\r\nvery hard, 4 apartments each containing one seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--The mountains of Morong and Tanay (of La Laguna Province)\r\nbear some specimens. Very common in the island of Negros and in\r\nMindanao. It also grows in the Visayas, Mindora and Paragua. Blooms\r\nin September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vitex trifolia_, L. (_V. repens_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Lagundi_, Tag.; _Gapasgapas_, Vis.; _Dangla_, Iloc.\r\n\r\n_Vitex Negundo_, L. (_V. Leucoxylon_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Lagundi_, _Malawin_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--Both species are used medicinally in the Philippines and both\r\nenjoy high repute. A variety of the first that seems to possess the\r\nsame virtues is the _V. repens_, Blanco, called _lagunding gapang_\r\nby the Tagalos.\r\n\r\n_V. trifolia_ is regarded in India as the most powerful species and\r\nBontius has extolled it highly, calling attention to the anodyne,\r\ndiuretic and emmenagogue properties of the leaves. These are very\r\neffective applied in fomentation to rheumatic joints and their use\r\nis extensive both in India and the Malay Archipelago. A decoction\r\nof the leaves is used locally and as a vapor-bath in the treatment\r\nof beriberi. A large earthen pot is filled with leaves and water and\r\nbrought to a boil; the pot is then placed under a chair in which the\r\npatient sits enveloped in a sheet or blanket. If necessary the pot may\r\nbe removed 2 or 3 times, heated and replaced until abundant sweating\r\nis induced. An apparatus to conduct the steam under the chair would\r\nbe much handier, but it is unsafe to place a small stove or lamp\r\nunder the chair for fear of setting fire to the cloth.\r\n\r\nIn India and the Philippines there is a peculiar inflammation localized\r\nin the soles of the feet and characterized by an intense burning\r\nrather than pain, not described in the textbooks, but called by the\r\nnatives \"burning of the feet\" (\"quemadura del pié\" or \"ignipedites\");\r\nin our own experience and according to the consensus of the physicians\r\nof India, the application of these leaves 3 or 4 times a day to the\r\nsoles of the feet has afforded marked relief. The leaves are heated\r\nin an earthen pot without the addition of water, and when sufficiently\r\nhot are applied and held in place by a bandage.\r\n\r\nDr. W. Ingledew states that the natives of Mysore (south of\r\nIndia) treat rheumatism and febrile catarrhs by steam baths of the\r\ndecoction of vitex. A decoction of the leaves is in common use in\r\nthe Philippines, Malay Islands and India as a bath for women in the\r\npuerperal state.\r\n\r\nThe dry leaves are smoked for headache and catarrh. According to\r\ncreditable authority the application of the heated leaves in orchitis\r\nproduces good results. The root is tonic, febrifuge and expectorant\r\nand the fruit nervine and emmenagogue according to the Sanscrit writer.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--_V. trifolia_ is a small tree, 3-4\r\nmeters high. The fruit and leaves are said to emit the odor of\r\nrosemary. Leaves ternate. Leaflets oval, entire, hoary below, no\r\nsecondary petioles. Flowers purplish in forked panicle. Corolla\r\nbell-shaped with palate. The lower lip 3-lobed, the middle lobe\r\nlarger; upper lip smaller, 2-lobed. Stamens 4, free, didynamous. Ovary\r\nfree. Style simple, with stigma-bearing lobules. Berry-like drupe,\r\nwith 4-celled nut, one seed in each cell.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common on the seashore. Blooms in June.\r\n\r\nThe _V. Negundo_ is a small tree like the preceding, but when\r\nit grows in the forest it develops to a tree of the first order,\r\nyielding a valuable building wood called _molave_ (Sp.) or more\r\nproperly _molawin_. Leaves compound with 5 leaflets. Secondary\r\npetioles short. Flowers in dichotomous panicle. Fruit like that of\r\nthe foregoing species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clerodendron infortunatum_, L. (_C. fortunatum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kasupangit_, _Gubat_, Tag.; _Saling-wak_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fresh juice of the leaves is used in India as a vermifuge,\r\naccording to K. L. Dey; it is also used as a bitter tonic in malarial\r\nfever, especially of children. As a tonic and antipyretic it is\r\ncertainly worthy of recommendation.\r\n\r\nDr. Bholanauth Bose calls attention to this plant as a good substitute\r\nfor _Ophelia chirata_, DC. as a tonic and antipyretic.\r\n\r\nThe infusion of the bruised leaves (10 grams to water 300 cc.) is given\r\nup to 200 cc. a day in 3 or 4 doses; the tincture (leaves 60 grams,\r\nalcohol 90 %, 500 cc.) is given up to 10 grams a day in 5 or 6 doses.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A shrub with nearly round stem; leaves\r\nopposite, ovate, oblong; acute, entire, slightly downy. Flowers\r\nterminal in umbellate panicles, the umbellets opposite and each bearing\r\n3 flowerets. Calyx bluish, long, tubular, somewhat expanded in the\r\nmiddle, divided in 5 parts. Corolla twice as long as the calyx, tube\r\nfiliform, limb 5-lobed. Stamens didynamous, their lower parts grown\r\nto the tube of the corolla. Filaments longer than the corolla. Ovary\r\nconical. Style of same length as the stamens. Stigma bifid. Berry\r\ndry, quadrate, depressed, the shell hard, 4 grooves, 4 cells, each\r\ncontaining a seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in Manila and in the forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLABIATÆ.\r\n\r\nMint Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ocimum basilicum_, L.

Vulg.--_Balanay_, Tag.; _Sacred Basil_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--All three species possess a characteristic camphoraceous\r\nodor and are commonly grouped under the one name, _albahacas_\r\n(sweet basil). Some natives call them _solasi_ and others _balanay_,\r\nbut many are able to distinguish the various species correctly. All\r\nthree have analogous properties, but the most widely used is the\r\n_O. basilicum_. These properties are stimulant, diaphoretic, and\r\nexpectorant, and the infusion is used commonly for flatulent colic\r\nand painful dyspepsia. The dry powdered leaves of the _O. sanctum_ are\r\ntaken as snuff by the natives of India in the treatment of a curious\r\nendemic disease characterized by the presence of small maggots in the\r\nnasal secretion; this disease is called peenash, and possibly exists\r\nin the Philippines though I have never encountered it.\r\n\r\nMartins states that in Brazil they use a decoction of the mucilaginous\r\nleaves of the _O. gratissimum_ in the treatment of gonorrhoea and\r\nDr. Waitz highly recommends a strong decoction of these leaves for the\r\naphthæ of children, which he claims to have cured by this means after\r\nall European drugs had failed. This fact and the action of the snuff\r\nabove mentioned, demonstrate the antiseptic properties of the plant,\r\ndue doubtless to its abundant aromatic principles.\r\n\r\n_O. basilicum_ contains a green essential oil, very aromatic,\r\nbecoming solid; it is a sort of camphor (C_20_H_16_6HO, Raybaud)\r\nand crystallizes in 4-faced prisms.\r\n\r\nAll the plants are used to prepare aromatic baths for cases of atrophy\r\nand debility in children (Waitz) and for the treatment of rheumatism\r\nand paralysis.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--_O. gratissimum_ is a plant 2-3° high, stem\r\nstraight, downy. Leaves medium lanceolate, finely serrate from the\r\nmiddle upwards, with short hairs and transparent dots. Flowers in\r\nlong terminal racemes. Calyx, upper lip horizontal, round; lower lip\r\n3 pointed parts, the middle one subdivided in two. Corolla yellowish,\r\ninverted, one lip cleft in 4 obtuse lobes; the other longer, narrow,\r\nserrate. Stamens didynamous, 2 shorter. Anthers semilunar. Stigma\r\nbifid. Seeds 4.\r\n\r\nThe _O. Americanum_ has leaves lanceolate, ovate, acute, full of\r\npores, somewhat downy. It is more fragrant than the other species\r\nand its flowers are bluish-white in racemes.\r\n\r\nThe _O. sanctum_ is the most sacred plant of the Hindoos, dedicated\r\nto Vishnu; its branches are wavy or cauliflexuous, leaves obliquely\r\novate, obtuse, serrate, nearly glabrous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--All species are very common and universally known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coleus aromaticus_, Benth. (_C. suganda_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Orégano_, Sp.-Fil.; _Suganda_, Tag.; _Marjoram_, Eng. (The\r\nSp. and Eng. names are incorrect.)\r\n\r\nUses.--The fleshy, aromatic leaves of this plant are bruised and\r\napplied locally for the bites of centipedes and scorpions. They\r\nare also applied to the temples and forehead for headache, held in\r\nplace by a bandage. In Cochin China they are used in asthma, chronic\r\nbronchitis, epilepsy and other convulsive diseases. The juice of the\r\nleaves is a carminative and is given to children suffering with wind\r\ncolic. Dr. Wight claims to have observed occasional intoxicating\r\neffects following its use, but Dymock states that he has never\r\nobserved such effects. The plant contains a coloring matter, _colein_\r\n(C_10_H_10_O_3_), red, insoluble in ether, soluble in alcohol, slightly\r\nsoluble in water. On the addition of ammonia the solution changes to\r\npurple, then violet, indigo, green, and, finally, greenish-yellow.\r\n\r\nAnother species, the _C. atropurpureus_, Benth. (_C. grandifolius_,\r\nBlanco), well known in the Philippines by its common name _mayana_,\r\nis used in the treatment of bruises, the bruised fleshy leaves being\r\nthe part employed; these leaves are downy and dark violet in color.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Leaves opposite, nearly sessile, cordate,\r\nobtuse, downy and very fleshy. Flowers in a quadrangular raceme, each\r\ngroup of these flowerets having a concave scale at the base. Calyx\r\nbell-shaped, 2-lipped; the upper lip longer and entire; the lower\r\nwith 4 narrow teeth. Corolla a pale violet, 5 times longer than the\r\ncalyx. Stamens didynamous, straight, longer than the corolla. Style\r\nbifid. Seeds 4.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Universally abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rosmarinus officinalis_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Romero_, Sp.; _Rosemary_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This is one of the plants most valued by the Filipinos. Its\r\ninfusion is used as an eye-wash for slight catarrhal conjunctivitis,\r\napplied 3 or 4 times a day. It is one of the aromatic plants used so\r\ncommonly to bathe women in the puerperal state, and in vapor baths\r\nfor rheumatism, paralysis and incipient catarrhs. The entire plant\r\nis a stimulant and carminative but little used internally; in atonic\r\ndyspepsia it has given good results taken in the same form as the\r\ninfusion of manzanilla.\r\n\r\nIt contains a large per cent. of an essential oil which gives the\r\nplant its agreeable odor. This oil enters into the composition of\r\n\"Cologne Water\"; it is said to arrest falling of the hair and is a\r\ndiffusible stimulant which may be given internally in doses of 3-5\r\ndrops. It is colorless and liquid when fresh, but in time becomes dark\r\nand viscid. It combines freely with alcohol and its density is 0.885.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant from 2 to 3° high. Leaves sessile,\r\nlinear, obtuse, margins revolute, white-hoary beneath. Calyx tubular,\r\n2-lipped. Corolla rose-violet color, gaping; the upper lip concave,\r\n2-lobed; the lower lip longer, 3-lobed. Stamens, 2 fertile and 2\r\nsterile. Style, same length as the stamens. Stigma simple. Fruit,\r\n4 seeds in the depths of the calyx.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--It is carefully cultivated throughout the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anisomeles ovata_, R. Br. (_Phlomis alba_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Taligharap_, Tag.; _Jerusalem Sage_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The infusion of the leaves is bitter and aromatic and is\r\nused in catarrhal inflammations of the stomach and intestines and\r\nin intermittent fevers. Used as a vapor-bath it produces abundant\r\ndiaphoresis, and the infusion given internally has a like effect. The\r\nleaves, when distilled, yield an oil which is used as an external\r\napplication in rheumatism.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 6° or more high. Root fibrous,\r\ntrunk and branches enlarged at the joints. Leaves opposite, ovate,\r\nobtusely serrate, soft and downy. Flowers pink, verticillate, in\r\nopposite clusters around the stem, with several linear and hairy\r\ninvolucres at the base of each cluster. Calyx, 5 sharp teeth. Corolla,\r\n2-lipped; the lower much larger, downy within, 3-lobed, the middle\r\nlobe larger and broader, notched at the extremity, and its borders\r\nturned downward; the other 2 lateral lobes very small, narrow;\r\nthe upper lip much shorter and smaller, entire, enveloping the\r\nstamens. Stamens didynamous. Style about the same length as the\r\nstamens. Stigma bifid. Fruit, 4 small seeds.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common on the fields of Manila Province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leucas aspera_, Spreng. (_Phlomis Zeylanica_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Pansipansi_, _Solasolasian_, _Karukansoli_, Tag.;\r\n_Pansipansi_, _Paypaysi_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The bruised leaves are applied to the bites of serpents or\r\npoisonous insects. In India they are similarly used. The juice of\r\nthe leaves is very useful in the treatment of certain skin diseases,\r\nespecially psoriasis.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant about 2° high, very well known to\r\nthe natives. Leaves sessile, lanceolate, finely serrate and covered\r\nwith short hairs. Flowers terminal, white, verticillate, with the\r\ncharacteristics of the mint family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTAGINACEÆ.\r\n\r\nPlantain Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plantago erosa_, Wall. (_P. crenata_ and _media_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Llantén_, Sp.-Fil.; _Lantín_, Tag.; _Plantain_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The leaves of this popular plant are the commonest remedy in\r\nthe Philippines for abscess of the gums. They are bruised and applied\r\nwith a little lard over the swollen cheek. It is emollient and,\r\nin decoction, is used as a substitute for flaxseed.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--This plant is so universally known that there\r\nis no fear of confusing it with others. It flourishes as a common\r\nweed in the U. S. as well as the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNYCTAGINACEÆ.\r\n\r\nFour-O'Clock Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mirabilis Jalapa_, L. (_M. longiflora_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Maravillas_, _Suspiros_, Sp.-Fil.; _Gilalas_, Tag.;\r\n_Four O'Clock_, _Marvel of Peru_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root is purgative and possesses the same active  principles,\r\nthe same properties and is given in the same dose as jalap. According\r\nto the experience of Shoolbred, Hunter, W. O'Shaughnessy and Ainslie,\r\nits purgative action is weak and uncertain and therefore unworthy\r\nof use as a substitute for jalap. The bruised leaves are used as\r\npoultices to hasten suppuration, but according to Waring they are\r\ncapable of causing dermatitis.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The flowers open toward the end of the day and\r\nclose again at sunrise. The root is blackish and spindle-shaped. The\r\nstem smooth, branches forked. Leaves opposite, lanceolate-cordate,\r\nacute, somewhat downy along the borders and the upper surface. Petioles\r\nshort. Flowers fragrant, almost constantly blooming, of different\r\ncolors even in the same plant, terminal, in umbels. Pedicels very\r\nshort. Calyx persistent, 5-toothed. Corolla superior, very long, its\r\ntube downy, funnel-form, limb 5-lobed. Stamens 5, longer than the\r\ncorolla. Style longer than the stamens. Stigma globose. Nut small,\r\nblack, globose, many-ribbed, full of a mealy substance.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMARANTHACEÆ.\r\n\r\nAmaranth Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amaranthus spinosus_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Kilitis_, _Orayi_, Tag.; _Ayantoto_, Pam.; _Kalitis_,\r\n_Tilites_, _Bayang-bayang_, Vis.; _Kuanton_, Iloc.; _Thorny Amaranth_,\r\nEng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The entire plant is emollient and its principal use is as a\r\npoultice for inflammations, bruises, etc. The decoction of the root is\r\ndiuretic and antiphlogistic and is used in Mauritius (30 grams root to\r\n750 cc. water) as an internal remedy for gonorrhoea; indeed it is there\r\nregarded as a specific for that disease, checking the discharge and\r\nthe \"ardor urinæ.\" It should be continued till the cure is complete.\r\n\r\nThe bruised leaves are used locally for eczema.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 2-3° high of a reddish color. Leaves\r\nalternate, lanceolate, broad, notched at the apex, wavy,\r\nglabrous. Petioles with a pair of spines in their axils. Flowers\r\nsmall, yellow-green, in round axillary clusters and in long\r\nterminal spikes. The pistillate flowers are sometimes separated from\r\nthe staminate, sometimes mixed with them in the lower part of the\r\nspike. Staminate: No corolla, calyx 2-5 parts, stamens 4-5. Pistillate:\r\nStyle and stigma 2 or 3, otherwise the same as the staminate. Seed\r\nvessel with 1 seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts. Blooms in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Achyranthes obtusifolia_, Lam. (_A. aspera_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Hangor_, _Hangot_, _Dokotdekot_, _Libay_, Tag.; _Angod_,\r\nPam.\r\n\r\nUses.--The plant has astringent and diuretic properties; the latter\r\nwere observed by Dr. Cornish, who communicated the facts to Waring,\r\ncalling special attention to the good service the drug had afforded him\r\nin dropsy. Other physicians in India have confirmed these observations\r\nof Cornish. The decoction is made of 60 grams of the entire plant\r\nto 750 cc. water, boiled till reduced one-half and strained under\r\npressure. Dose, 60 cc. every 2 hours till diuresis is induced.\r\n\r\nThe ashes of this plant, like those of the _Amaranthus spinosus_,\r\nL., contain a large quantity of potassa, and are used for washing\r\nclothes; on this account it has received its Sanscrit name _Apamarga_\r\n(the washer). The ashes are also mixed in an infusion of ginger and\r\ngiven internally in dropsy.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are bruised and applied to the bites of snakes and other\r\npoisonous animals. In India there is a superstition that carrying\r\nthese flowers about the person will keep off scorpions.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant about 3° high, the stem angular and\r\ndowny. Leaves opposite, downy, clasping the stem, lanceolate, very\r\nobtuse and wavy. Flowers bent downward in a long spike bearing many\r\nflowerets. Calyx, 5 tough scales. Corolla wanting. Nectary much smaller\r\nthan the calyx, monophyllous, 5-lobed. Stamens 5. Ovary top-shaped,\r\nupper part somewhat concave. Style same length as stamens. Stigma\r\ncoarse, bifid. Fruit, a seed covered with 2 membranes, one enveloping\r\nit completely, the outer one adherent in only one part.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon. Blooms in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHENOPODIACÆ.\r\n\r\nGoosefoot Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chenopodium ambrosioides_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Alpasotes_, Sp.-Fil.; _Pasotis_, _Apasotis_, Tag.;\r\n_American Worm-seed_, _Mexican Tea_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant is a native of Mexico. It has a peculiar, somewhat\r\noffensive odor and an acrid, aromatic taste due to an essential oil\r\nresembling peppermint (?). According to Padre Mercado, \"When the seeds\r\nare taken with wine, sensation is so dulled that the drinker may be\r\nwhipped without feeling the lashes, and even if put to the torment,\r\ndoes not feel it.\" These properties, if true, make this plant one of\r\nthe most useful in the Philippines. The entire plant is stimulant. The\r\ninfusion, given internally, causes sweating, excites the circulation,\r\nis diuretic, tonic, stomachic, and useful as well as an antispasmodic\r\nin nervous troubles. The leaves are employed in making the infusion, 8\r\ngrams to 200 of boiling water. It is widely used in bronchial catarrhs\r\nand in asthma on account of its sudorific and expectorant action. It\r\nseems also to possess emmenagogue properties. The seeds yield on\r\ndistillation a yellow essential oil with a strong and disagreeable\r\nodor, density 0.908. Both seeds and flowers are vermifuge, and are\r\nused as such in Brazil in doses of 8 grams in infusion or with an\r\nequal dose of castor oil. The anthelmintic dose of the essential oil\r\nis 5-15 drops with powdered sugar.\r\n\r\nRilliet and Barthez recommend the following potion for infantile\r\nchorea:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Leaves of chenopodium       4 grams.\r\n        Water                     500 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake an infusion and add syrup of orange flowers 50 grams. Dose,\r\nseveral tablespoonfuls a day.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 2° high; stem beset with\r\nhairs, many-angled. Leaves lanceolate, varying from entire\r\nto cut-pinnatifid. Flowers green, sessile, axillary, in small\r\nclusters. Calyx 5-parted. Corolla wanting. Stamens 5. Filaments\r\nflattened, inserted near the center of the flowers opposite the parts\r\nof the calyx. Anthers in 2 globose parts. Ovary superior, globose,\r\ndepressed, unilocular, uniovulate. Style none. Stigmas, 2, 3 or 4,\r\nshort, divergent. Fruit a lenticular seed covered by the membrane of\r\nthe ovary.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in gardens and fields. Blooms in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARISTOLOCHIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nBirthwort Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aristolochia Indica_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Timbangan_, _Malaubi_, Tag.; _Indian Birthwort_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root has a wide use in medicine in the Philippines; it\r\nis bitter, of a nauseating odor and has the reputation of being a\r\npowerful antidote for the bites of poisonous serpents and insects. It\r\nhas further use in the treatment of malarial fever, in dyspepsia,\r\nand in the flatulent colic of teething children. It is regarded as\r\ntonic and emmenagogue. In various forms of diarrhoea it appears to\r\nbe effective and Dr. Gibson states that it is useful in intestinal\r\ndisorders. In the Philippines it is not only given internally but\r\nalso externally applied over the abdomen, mixed with hot cocoanut oil\r\n(10 grams of the powdered root to 100 oil).\r\n\r\nThe first Portuguese settlers in India called the drug \"Cobra Root,\"\r\nbecause the natives regarded it as an antidote for the bite of the\r\nterrible \"Cobra da Capello.\" This reputation, however, seems not to\r\nhave been deserved, judging from the fearful mortality in India and\r\nCeylon due to the bite of the cobra.\r\n\r\nDr. Imlach, a surgeon of Singapore, states that in one season in\r\none collectorate, Shikapore, no less than 306 cases of snake bites\r\nwere officially reported, the mortality being 63, or about 20.58\r\nper cent. Other reports make it safe to conclude that in the entire\r\nprovince during the year no less than 300 deaths were due to this\r\ncause alone. Dr. Waring believes that if an antidote for snake bite\r\nexist in the vegetable kingdom it will most probably be found in the\r\nnatural order Aristolochiaceæ.\r\n\r\nIn North India this drug is used as emmenagogue and anti-arthritic, and\r\nin Banda for intermittent fevers and intestinal disorders. The juice of\r\nthe leaves is emetic. The dose of the powdered root is 3-5 grams daily.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A twining shrub, with leaves heart-shaped,\r\novate, acute, glabrous. Petioles short. Flowers dark reddish-gray, in\r\npanicles. Calyx wanting. Corolla globose below, the tube cylindrical,\r\nexpanding at the top. Anthers 6, in pairs. Filaments, none. Styles 6,\r\nvery coarse, a membrane at the base including all. Stigmas simple. Seed\r\nvessel inferior, 6-ribbed, 6 cells and many winged seeds. The seed\r\nvessel after casting the seeds resembles a pair of balance scales\r\nwith its little plates or pans. Hence the Tagalo name _Timbangan_\r\nmeaning \"balance.\"\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In Luzon and Panay. Blooms in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPERACEÆ.\r\n\r\nPepper Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Piper Betle_, L. (_Chavica Betle_ and _C. auriculata_, Miq.; _Piper\r\nBetel_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Hojas de buyo_, Sp.-Fil.; _Itmó_, Tag.; _Mamin_, Bic.;\r\n_Buyo_, _Mamón_, Vis.; _Samat_, Pam.; _Betel Pepper_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--A masticatory, used all over the extreme Orient, is composed\r\nof the leaves of this plant, a little slaked oyster-shell lime\r\nand a rounded slice of the bonga or areca nut; the Filipinos call\r\nthis combination _bayo_, though the name is not of native origin;\r\nthe Tagalos call it _hitsú_. The use of buyo by careless persons is\r\ndecidedly repugnant, for the mixture of the lime and the pigment of the\r\nbonga imparts a blood-red or rather brick-red color to the saliva which\r\nthey spit in mouthfuls into the streets and other public places with\r\nno thought of the feelings of others. Unless the mouth is carefully\r\ncleaned the teeth become encrusted with a sort of black enamel and\r\nthe breath assumes a detestable odor. When used in small quantities\r\nand with proper toilet of the mouth, and this is the common practice\r\namong the Filipinos, buyo seems to be a very useful preservative\r\nof the teeth and a gingival and stomachic tonic. These properties\r\nare readily understood when we consider that the lime is antacid,\r\nthe bonga astringent and tonic and the betel aromatic and stimulant.\r\n\r\nThe buyo leaf plays a very important part in the therapeutics of the\r\ninfant of the Philippines: in its indigestions, colics and diarrhoeas\r\nthe heated leaves are applied to the abdomen previously anointed\r\nwith hot cocoanut oil. In bronchitis and laryngitis the heated\r\nleaves are applied over the chest or neck after rubbing the parts\r\nwith oil. It undoubtedly produces good effects and the physicians of\r\nIndia recommend it in the same cases and in the same form as in the\r\nPhilippines. Applied to the breasts of parturient women it dries up\r\nthe milk and in the same way tends to reduce any glandular enlargement.\r\n\r\nDr. Kleinstück of Java recommends the essence of the leaves in\r\nall sorts of catarrhs and as an antiseptic in doses of one drop\r\nto 140 of the vehicle. This essence is obtained by distillation;\r\nit is dark in color, has an acrid taste and an odor resembling that\r\nof tea. Its density is 1.020. The dried leaves contain one-half per\r\ncent. of the essence and it is probable that the fresh ones contain\r\na greater proportion.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant with yellow flowers and scandent stem,\r\nclimbing straight up trees or artificial supports. Leaves cleft at\r\nthe base, acute, entire, glabrous, dark green. According to Blanco\r\nit is cultivated best in somewhat sandy soil. Pasay, near Manila,\r\nand Bauang, in Batangas, furnish a leaf most highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Piper nigrum_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Pimienta_, Sp.; _Paminta_, _Malisa_, Tag.; _Black\r\nPepper_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The berry-like fruit of the pepper is more extensively used\r\nas a condiment in cooking than in the treatment of disease. Used in\r\nmoderation, however, it is of considerable value as a convenient\r\nstomachic and aid to digestion in tropical countries where the\r\ndigestive functions readily become sluggish. Its abuse may lead to\r\nserious consequences, such as inflammation of the gastro-intestinal\r\nmucous membrane, of the portal system and the liver itself.\r\n\r\nPepper is used as a febrifuge in the various forms of malarial fevers,\r\nin the form of granules of 8 or 10 berries in a cup of brandy and anise\r\n(Spanish); this is taken by the patient in one dose at the beginning of\r\nthe cold stage and followed by large quantities of water to relieve the\r\nthirst caused by the pepper. This treatment causes the cold stage to\r\nrapidly subside and more rapidly induces and intensifies the sweating\r\nstage. It is said that no further attack of fever follows.\r\n\r\nPiperin (C_17_H_19_NO_3_) is febrifuge and is given in pill form\r\ninternally in doses of 30-60 centigrams; the action of the crude drug\r\nis evidently due to this neutral principle.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The plant is a perennial, climbing\r\nshrub. Leaves oval, tapering at both extremities, 7-nerved. Flowers\r\nyellow, in a spike. Stigmas 2, bifid. Fruit globose, with one seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--The dried fruit of the pepper is universally familiar. It was\r\nat one time cultivated in the Philippines, especially in Batangas,\r\nand Gen. Basco promulgated a series of orders to encourage its\r\ncultivation. Padre Gainza, afterward Bishop of Nueva Cáceres, wrote a\r\nreport about its cultivation, but since then the subject has entirely\r\ndisappeared from notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORANTHACEÆ.\r\n\r\nChloranth Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chloranthus officinalis_, Bl. (_C. Indicus_, Wight.;\r\n_C. inconspicuus_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--Unknown.\r\n\r\nUses.--All parts of the plant are aromatic. The leaves and stems\r\nlose this property after drying, but the roots, if properly dried,\r\npreserve it for a long time. They have a camphoraceous odor and\r\nbitter, aromatic taste, reminding one of that of _Aristolochia\r\nSerpentaria_. The mountaineers of Java use an infusion of the\r\npowdered root and the bark of the _Cinnamomum Culilowan_ to treat\r\npuerperal eclampsia. Combined with carminatives like anise and onion,\r\nthey use it with some success in virulent small-pox of children. The\r\ninfusion seems to be efficacious in fevers accompanied by debility and\r\nsuppression of the function of the skin. It has also been prescribed\r\nin the intermittent fevers of Java, mixed with an infusion of the\r\nleaves of the _Cedrela Toona_. Blume states that it is one of the\r\nmost powerful stimulants known.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant 3-4° high. Stem quadrangular. Leaves\r\nopposite, broad, lanceolate, serrate, with stiff-pointed teeth and\r\nsomewhat scaly beneath. Petioles very short, clasping the stem at\r\ntheir base, with 2 intermediate stipules ending in two awl-shaped\r\npoints. Flowers compound in axillary spikes, which bear the flowerets\r\nin 2 ranks, each flower with a keeled bract. The corolla (if it may\r\nbe so called) a fleshy, 3-lobed lamina. Perianth wanting. Receptacle\r\ndome-shaped. Anthers 4, inserted on the surface of the lamina,\r\n2-valved. Ovary 1-celled, with 1 ovule. Style short. Berry-like fruit,\r\nglobose, with 1 seed covered by a somewhat brittle membrane.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--La Laguna and other provinces of Luzon. Blooms in September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAURACEÆ.\r\n\r\nLaurel Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cinnamomum pauciflorum_, Nees. (_Laurus culilaban_, Var., Blanco.)\r\n\r\n_C. tamala_, Nees. (_L. culilaban_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg. (of both).--_Kalingag_, _Makalingag_, Tag., Vis.;\r\n_Kandaroma_, Iloc; _Cassia Lignea_ or _Cassia_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The bark of both species is known in pharmacy as Chinese\r\ncassia or Chinese cinnamon (cassia cinnamon). Indeed it is very like\r\nthe cinnamon of Ceylon, comes in curled quills, has the same odor and\r\ntaste though not so delicate; but it is darker in color, with a surface\r\nless clean and smooth. Its chemical composition is identical with that\r\nof the latter and nowadays it forms an important article of commerce.\r\n\r\nCinnamon renders good service in therapeutics as a stimulant of the\r\ndigestive tract and a heart tonic. In the atonic diarrhoeas so common\r\nin the Philippines a tincture of cinnamon in doses of 8-10 grams a\r\nday, or the powder in cases where alcohol was contraindicated, have\r\ngiven me unhoped-for results.\r\n\r\nIn Spain and the Philippines it is very popular as a condiment in the\r\nkitchen of the confectionery and as a flavor for chocolate; in fact\r\nin those countries it takes the place of vanilla in France. It enters\r\ninto the composition of several elixirs and compound tinctures, such\r\nas \"Botot's Water\" (dentifrice), \"Elixir of Garus\" (tonic stimulant),\r\n\"Balsam of Fioraventi\" (external stimulant), laudanum and the elixir\r\nof the Grande Chartreuse (diffusible stimulant).\r\n\r\nLately it has been demonstrated that the essence is a powerful\r\nantiseptic, in the presence of which typhoid fever bacilli cannot\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 15-20° high. Leaves opposite,\r\nlanceolate, 3-nerved, entire, glabrous. Flowers yellow, paniculate,\r\numbellate. Common peduncles very long, those of the flowerets\r\nlong. Calyx none. Corolla, 6 ovate, hairy petals. Stamens 9; 6\r\nexternal to the rest and bearing the anthers, 4 on each filament,\r\n2 below the others; the 3 inner stamens bear 2 anthers each.\r\n\r\nIn the second species the flowers form loose, terminal\r\npanicles. Stamens 9; 6 filaments inserted on the receptacle, spatulate,\r\neach bearing 4 anthers on the inferior face; the other 3 filaments\r\nthick, each bearing 4 anthers. Between the last filaments are 8 nearly\r\nglobose glandules.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Both species are common in the forests of Luzon. The first\r\nspecies blooms in May, the second in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cassytha filiformis_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Malabohok._\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant has no therapeutical uses in the Philippines. In\r\nSenegal it is employed, according to Dujardin-Beaumetz, mixed with\r\nlard to treat urethritis; its action is to decrease the ardor urinæ. It\r\nis not stated whether this mixture is used internally or externally.\r\n\r\nIn Cochin China the same writer states that it is used as an\r\nantisyphilitic. In India it is used for the piles and as an alterative\r\nfor bilious disorders. It possibly acts as a circulatory stimulant.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A slender, thread-like, cylindrical vine,\r\nwithout leaves, that covers the trees like a mantle, so luxuriant\r\nis its growth. Flowers yellow, in axillary spikes. Calyx small, 3\r\nsepals. Corolla, 3 fleshy concave petals. Stamens 12 in 4 verticils,\r\n9 fertile and 3 inner sterile. Ovary 1-celled, 1-ovuled. Style\r\ncylindrical. Drupe globose, 1-2'' in diameter, covered by a fleshy\r\nenvelope, formed by the receptacle. Seeds without albumen.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon, Mindanao, Cebú, on the seashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUPHORBIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nSpurge Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Euphorbia pilulifera_, L. (_E. capitata_, Lam.; _E. hirta_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Golondrina_, Sp.-Fil.; _Gatasgatas_, _Batobatonis_,\r\n_Sayikan_, Tag.; _Buyayawa_, _Tawawa_, _Bowi_, Vis.; _Malismalis_,\r\n_Sisiwhan_, _Bolobotones_, _Magatas_, Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant has a reputation in the Philippines as a hæmostatic\r\nof great efficiency, for which purpose the whole plant is crushed and\r\napplied as a poultice over the wound. Like all members of this family\r\nit abounds in milky juice. We have had no occasion to employ it as a\r\nhæmostatic, but do not doubt its action in view of the effect that it\r\nexercises on the circulation and the heart when given internally. In\r\ntoxic doses experiment has demonstrated that it kills animals by\r\nsuspension of the respiratory movements and those of the heart,\r\nwhich at first beats faster but gradually more slowly. It has no\r\neffect upon any other organ and is eliminated by the liver.\r\n\r\nMatheson recommends it as an antispasmodic and has employed it also in\r\ndyspnoea of cardiac origin. I have used it in both these conditions\r\nin Manila with highly satisfactory results. I have found the most\r\nconvenient form of administration to be the tincture in doses of\r\n15-40 drops a day given in an infusion of althæa every 3 or 4 hours;\r\nthe vehicle should be used liberally as it diminishes the irritant\r\naction of the euphorbia on the stomach. A decoction of 15 grams\r\nof the plant to 2 liters of water may be given in doses of from 6\r\nto 12 tablespoonfuls daily. A proper dose of the alcoholic extract\r\nis 10 centigrams in 24 hours. Dr. Daruty, of Mauritius, gives the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Euphorbia pilulifera_ dried in the shade     30 grams.\r\n        Water                                          1 1/2 liters.\r\n\r\nBoil till reduced to 1 liter, cool and add:\r\n\r\n        Rum or cognac                                 30 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nDose.--1 wineglassful 3 times a day.\r\n\r\nThis decoction relieves the most obstinate asthma, as well as cough\r\nand bronchial irritation. It is necessary to use the entire plant. The\r\ndecoction is usually given in the morning, fasting, in the middle of\r\nthe afternoon and at bedtime. In very stubborn cases another dose\r\nmay be given in the middle of the night. Frequently the relief is\r\nimmediate and in some cases a liter of the decoction is enough to\r\neffect a cure. If the symptoms return, it is easy to abort them; they\r\nare less distressing and, according to the statements of patients,\r\nthe medicine \"gives them air.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hicks Bunting found, in an analysis of the drug, 60 per cent. of\r\ninsoluble residue, wax, \"caucho,\" resin, tannin, sugar, albuminoids,\r\noxalate of calcium and other salts.\r\n\r\nDr. Marsset states that the active principle is soluble in water, in\r\ndilute alcohol; insoluble in ether, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon,\r\nand turpentine, but does not give the reaction.\r\n\r\nThe toxic dose is 1 gram of dried plant for each kilogram of weight\r\nof the animal.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small creeping plant with milky juice. Stem\r\n1-2° high, cylindrical, hairy and reddish in color. Leaves opposite,\r\nobliquely ovate, rhomboid, serrate, hairy. Petioles very short. Two\r\npointed stipules at the base. Flowers yellowish in hemispherical\r\numbels of 5 divisions, each subdivided in 2. Involucre universal. Calyx\r\nbell-shaped, laciniate, in 5 parts. Corolla, 5 petals, inserted on the\r\ndivisions of the calyx, fleshy, orbicular, with an orbicular appendix\r\nat the base, concave and differing from the corolla in color. Stamens\r\n8, inserted on the base of the calyx; filaments unequal in length,\r\neach bearing 2 anthers. Four filaments lacking anthers. Ovary with\r\nstalk longer than the flower, curved downward. Styles 3, bifid. Stigmas\r\nsimple. Seed vessels 3, united, hairy, 3-angled, each bearing 1 red\r\nglobose seed with a wrinkled surface.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts of the islands and well known to the\r\nnatives. The name by which it is best known in Manila is \"golondrina.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Euphorbia neriifolia_, L. (_E. ligularia_, Roxb.; _E. pentagona_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sorosoro_, _Sorog-sorog_, _Bait_, Tag., Pam.;\r\n_Karambauaya_, Iloc.; _Lengua de perro_, Sp.-Fil.\r\n\r\nUses.--The principal medicinal use of this plant in the Philippines\r\nis the introduction of the hot juice of its fleshy leaves into the\r\nexternal auditory canal in cases of otorrhoea or of simple earache,\r\nwhatever its cause.\r\n\r\nThe root is regarded in India as an antidote for snake bite and,\r\nindeed, the plant is sacred to Munsa, the snake divinity. During the\r\nmonths of July and August in some parts of India the natives make\r\nofferings of rice, milk and sugar to this sacred tree every Tuesday\r\nand Thursday, praying for protection from the bites of serpents.\r\n\r\nThe leaves contain an abundance of milky juice, acrid and very\r\nactive, used in the treatment of several skin diseases. Like the\r\nspecies _E. pilulifera_ it possesses antiasthmatic properties;\r\nDr. S. C. Amcobury reports 6 cases treated with satisfactory\r\nresults. Owing to the acrid quality of the juice great care should be\r\nmaintained both in its internal and external use. The Sanscrit authors\r\nregard it as purgative and usually administer it with other drugs of\r\nthe same action to increase its effect. Ainslie states that the native\r\nherb-doctors of India give the juice in intestinal obstruction and in\r\nthe oedema of malarial cachexia. The dose is 1.25 grams in 24 hours\r\ngiven in 300 cc. of sweetened water in divided doses. This dose is,\r\nin my opinion, dangerous; 40-60 centigrams a day is more prudent.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree, from 5 to 6° high. Trunk erect,\r\njointed, 5-sided, at the angles 2 rows of thorns. Leaves spatulate,\r\nfleshy. Flowers yellowish. Calyx bell-shaped, 5-lobed. Corolla,\r\nnumerous imbricated, spatulate petals with ravelled or fringed\r\nends. Stamens in groups. Styles 3. Stigma coarse. Seed vessel,\r\n3 carpels on a stalk.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--In all parts of Luzon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Euphorbia Tirucalli_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Consuelda_, Sp.-Fil.; _Katwit_, _Suelda_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The milky juice of this species is very caustic. It is used\r\nchiefly in India mixed with oil as an embrocation for rheumatism;\r\ngiven internally it is regarded as an antisyphilitic. Dr. J. Shortt\r\nstates that it is an excellent alterant in syphilis in dose of 30\r\ncentigrams, morning and evening. It is further employed in malarial\r\nhypertrophy of the spleen, in asthma and as a purgative; in a word\r\nthe same virtues are attributed to it as to the foregoing species.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Small trees, 9-12° high. Trunk erect. Branches\r\ncylindrical, stumpy (not tapering), several very small leaves at\r\nthe ends. Flowers yellowish, in umbels. Calyx, 5 rounded, fleshy\r\nsepals. Corolla, 5 groups of woolly hairs on the divisions of the\r\ncalyx. Stamens 5, inserted on the sepals, with double or irregular\r\nanthers. Seed vessel, 3 carpels each with one seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common, especially in the suburbs of Manila where they\r\nserve as hedges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phyllanthus reticulatus_, Müll. (_Cica decandra_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tinatinaan_, _Tintatintahan_, _Malinta_, Tag.;\r\n_Sungot-olang_, Vis.\r\n\r\nUses.--The natives eat the little berries of this species, which are\r\ndark purple before and black after maturity, and use their juice for\r\nink. The leaves are diuretic and refreshing; the bark alterant. In\r\nthe bazaars of India the bark is sold commonly in pieces 1° long\r\nand as thick as the wrist; its taste is slightly sweet, color dark\r\nand the alterative dose of its decoction is 120-150 grams a day. In\r\nConcan they make a compound pill of the leaf-juice, powdered cubebs\r\nand camphor, to be dissolved in the mouth for ulcerated, bleeding or\r\nscorbutic gums. The juice is also given internally for urticaria.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Small trees, 12° or more high, with leaves\r\npinnate, oval, entire, alternate, glabrous, downy when young. Common\r\npetiole, 2 stipules at the base. Flowers monoecious. Staminate: calyx,\r\n5 colored sepals; no corolla; filaments 4, coarse, somewhat shorter\r\nthan the calyx, the middle one thicker and 2-parted; anthers 10,\r\n4 on the middle filament and two on each of the others. Pistillate:\r\ncalyx and corolla same as staminate; nectary, 5 glandules on the base\r\nof the ovary. Fruit, a black berry seated within the calyx, crowned\r\nwith 2 erect styles, 6 or 8 compartments each with a single seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows everywhere and is well known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phyllanthus Niruri_, L.\r\n\r\n_P. urinaria_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Hierba de San Pablo, de San Pedro_, Sp.\r\n\r\nUses.--This species is not used medicinally in the Philippines, but\r\nin India is given for its diuretic effect and has great repute in\r\nthe treatment of genito-urinary diseases, dropsy and gonorrhoea. The\r\ninfusion of the leaves of _P. Niruri_ with Fenugreek seeds is a\r\nhighly prized remedy for chronic dysentery, mentioned by Ainslie. The\r\nleaves are bitter and tonic and in Bombay they are in common use in\r\ngonorrhoea to correct the acidity of the urine. Bruised and mixed with\r\nsalt they make a sort of jelly frequently used as an application for\r\nitch; without salt the same is used for contusions.\r\n\r\nThe dose of the leaf juice of both species, for internal use, is 15\r\ngrams a day in divided doses.\r\n\r\nA decoction of the entire plant well dried and powdered, is given\r\nfor jaundice in doses of 5 grams a day.\r\n\r\nThe milky juice of the stem is useful in the local treatment of\r\nulcers. The bruised root is employed in Concan for neuralgia.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--_P. Niruri_ is an herb with straight\r\nstem. Leaves alternate, pinnate with stylet in place of the\r\nodd leaflet. Leaflets nearly oval, glabrous, 2 stipules at\r\nthe base. Flowers monoecious, greenish, axillary; the staminate\r\ngrowing along the common petiole above the pistillate. Staminate:\r\nCalyx, 5 lanceolate, entire sepals; no corolla; 1 filament with 1\r\nanther. Pistillate: Calyx and corolla as above; ovary free, 3 biovulate\r\ncells; style with 2 stigma-bearing branches. Fruit capsular, globose.\r\n\r\n_P. urinaria_ may be distinguished by its sessile flowers and\r\nreddish stem.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in Manila and all over Luzon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jatropha Curcas_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tuba_, Tag.; _Kasla_, Vis.; _Tawatawa_, Iloc. (Seeds\r\ncalled \"English Physic Nuts\" in India.)\r\n\r\nUses.--The milky juice of the trunk and branches is a drastic\r\npurgative, too active for safety as a physic. Mixed with water it is\r\nused as a wash for atonic ulcers.\r\n\r\nThe seeds yield 25-30 per cent. of a yellowish oil, more active than\r\ncastor oil as a purgative but less certain. Ten or twelve of the\r\nformer equal in effect 30 to 40 drops of the latter. Its density is\r\n0.919, and it differs from castor oil in being only slightly soluble\r\nin absolute alcohol. In some parts of the Philippines it is used for\r\npurposes of illumination, and it is exported to Europe to adulterate\r\nsoaps and candles. It contains a little stearin which begins to be\r\ndeposited at 9° and is entirely solidified at 0°.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is strongly purgative, and this action is not due to the\r\noil but to a peculiar resin so active that 3 fruits produce drastic\r\neffects. Whatever purgative action the oil possesses is due to the\r\nresin which it contains in solution. It seems, therefore, preferable\r\nto treat the seeds with alcohol, thus dissolving the resin, and use\r\nthe tincture thus obtained in place of the oil.\r\n\r\nThe natives use the plant to intoxicate the fish in ponds and sluggish\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the species _J. multifida_, L., also called _tuba_ in\r\nTag., and _mana_, are likewise purgative in their action. Dr. Waring\r\nsaw a case of poisoning with the fruit; the patient, a young man,\r\nsuffered violent vomiting, intense pain in the stomach and head,\r\nand marked prostration. He recovered under the use of lime juice\r\nand stimulants.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The _J. Curcas_ is a small tree growing as high\r\nas 9°. Leaves alternate, cordate, glabrous, 3-5 cut-lobed. Flowers\r\nyellowish-green, monoecious, in terminal umbels, staminate and\r\npistillate flowers mingled without order. Staminate: Calyx, 5 unequal\r\nsepals; corolla bell-shaped, 5 petals, woolly within, a small notch\r\nat the end, bent downward; stamens 10, in 2 whorls of 5. Pistillate:\r\nCalyx and corolla as above; several tongue-like staminodes replace\r\nthe stamens; ovary free, oblong, 3-celled, 1 ovule in each cell;\r\nstyle 3-branched. Seed vessel fleshy, of 3 capsules, each bearing 1\r\noval, coriaceous seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon and Visayas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aleurites Moluccana_, Willd. (_A. triloba_, Forst. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Lumbán_, _Kapili_, Tag.; _Belgaum_ or _Indian Walnut_,\r\nIndo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The kernels are rich in oil which is used for illumination\r\nand the manufacture of soap. For industrial purposes it is superior\r\nto linseed oil, according to the report of the Madras Drug Committee.\r\n\r\nDr. O'Rocke states that in doses of 1-2 ounces it acts as a gentle\r\nand sure purgative, producing copious bilious evacuations after 3-6\r\nhours, without causing nausea, colic or other similar effects. The\r\nmunicipal physician of Sampaloc, Señor Xerez, states that he has\r\nfrequently used this oil in Manila, as a purgative, and he agrees\r\nperfectly with Dr. O'Rocke as to its effect.\r\n\r\nD. Anacleto del Rosario, the distinguished Filipino chemist, tells\r\nme that he once witnessed a case of poisoning by the fruit of the\r\n_lumbán_, the patient being a native boy. Doubtless the milky juice,\r\nso active in all the Euphorbiaceæ, was the cause of the symptoms. It\r\nis true that the kernel causes colic and copious alvine discharges.\r\n\r\nNellino's chemical analysis of the seeds is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n            Water               5.25\r\n            Fatty matter       62.97\r\n            Cellulose          28.99\r\n            Mineral matter      2.79\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ashes contain the following matters:\r\n\r\n\r\n            Lime               28.69%\r\n            Magnesia            6.01%\r\n            Potash             11.23%\r\n            Phosphoric acid    20.30%\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oil is yellow, syrupy, transparent, odorless, insipid.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree with leaves bunched or clustered,\r\n3-5 lobulate with as many nerves. Petioles about as long as\r\nthe leaves. Flowers white, terminal in panicles, the pistillate\r\nmixed with the more numerous staminate flowers. Staminate: Calyx\r\nmonophyllous, cylindrical, 2-toothed; corolla, 5 linear petals twice\r\nas long as the calyx; stamens 20 or more, joined in a column at\r\ntheir bases. Pistillate: Calyx and corolla as above; ovary of 2 or 3\r\nuniovulate locules, encircled by a disk; style 2-or 3-branched. Seed\r\nvessel large, ovate, compressed, fleshy, 2 sutures at right angles,\r\n2 compartments, in each a hard nut.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows all over Luzon and is well known to the natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Croton Tiglium_, L. (_C. glandulosum_, _C. muricatum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tuba kamaisa_, Tag.; _The Purging Croton_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit is used by the Filipinos to intoxicate the fish\r\nin ponds and sluggish streams. The seeds contain an oil that\r\nis official in all Pharmacopoeias as one of the most powerful\r\nhydragogue cathartics. As it is intensely irritating it should never\r\nbe administered alone but combined with other substances, such as\r\ncastor oil, or in pill form. The internal dose is 1 to 2 drops. It\r\nis considered a specific for lead colic and is indicated when not\r\nonly purgation but active irritation of the digestive canal is desired.\r\n\r\nApplied to the skin it is a strong irritant causing rapid and painful\r\nvesication. Great care should be exercised not to raise the hands to\r\nthe eyes after touching the oil, as serious inflammation might result.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree, 8-9° high, with rough\r\ntrunk. Leaves alternate, ovate, acute, minutely serrate, both surfaces\r\nbeset with sharp hairs. Flowers yellowish-white, monoecious. Staminate:\r\nFewer than the pistillate, growing above them; calyx 5-toothed;\r\ncorolla, 5 woolly petals; stamens 16, joined in the center. Pistillate:\r\nCalyx 5-toothed; corolla much less developed than in the staminate;\r\novary free, 3 uniovulate locules; styles 3, bifid. Seed vessel\r\ndry, with thin envelope bristling with stiff hairs; 3 carpels each\r\ncontaining a seed.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acalypha Indica_, L. (_A. Caroliniana_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--Not known.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant is not used medicinally in the Philippines, but\r\nis very common in India. Dr. G. Bidie, of Madras, states that the\r\nexpressed juice of the leaves is in great repute, wherever the plant\r\ngrows, as an emetic for children and is safe, certain and speedy in\r\nits action. Like ipecacuanha it seems to have little tendency to act on\r\nthe bowels or depress the vital powers, and it decidedly increases the\r\nsecretion of the pulmonary organs. Probably an infusion of the dried\r\nleaves or an extract prepared from the green plant would retain all\r\nits active properties. The dose of the expressed juice for an infant\r\nis a teaspoonful.\r\n\r\nDr. A. E. Ross speaks highly of its use as an expectorant, ranking\r\nit in this respect with senega; he found it especially useful in the\r\nbronchitis of children. He also makes favorable report of a cataplasm\r\nof the leaves as a local application to syphilitic ulcers and as a\r\nmeans of relieving the pain attendant on the bites of venomous insects.\r\n\r\nThe alleged purgative action of the root noticed by Ainslie is\r\nconfirmed by Dr. H. E. Busteed, who reports having used the expressed\r\njuice of the root and leaves as a laxative for children.\r\n\r\nLangley, a military surgeon, states that in Canara the natives employ\r\nthe leaf juice in congestive headache, soaking pledgets of cotton\r\nwith it and introducing them into the nasal fossæ; the resultant\r\nnose bleed relieves the headache. The powder of the dry leaves is\r\ndusted on ulcers and putrid sores. In asthma and bronchitis, both of\r\nchildren and adults, Langley has used this plant with good results,\r\nand he recommends 1.25-3.50 grams of the tincture (100 grams of the\r\nfresh plant to 500 of alcohol, 90°) repeated several times a day;\r\nthe effect is expectorant, nauseant and, in large doses, emetic.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that only the young, growing plants are active.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of another species, _A. hispida_, Burm., called _bugos_\r\nin Tag. and Vis., is used in India for the dysentery.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A little plant, about 3° high. Leaves\r\nalternate, broad, lanceolate, 5-nerved, serrate from middle to\r\napex. Petioles much longer than the leaves, 2 stipules at their\r\nbases. Flowers greenish, monoecious in axillary spikes, pedunculate, as\r\nlong as the leaves, crowned by a prolongation of the axis in the form\r\nof a cross. Staminate: Numerous, in upper part of spike; calyx 4 parts;\r\nno corolla; stamens 8-16, small, free. Pistillate: Less in number,\r\nat the base of the spike; perianth of 3 imbricated leaflets; ovary,\r\n3 uniovulate locules; style, 3 branches which also subdivide. Capsule\r\n3-celled, each cell containing a globose seed with cicatrix.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Luzon, Panay and Mindanao. Blooms in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Echinus Philippensis_, H. Baillon. (_Croton Philippense_, Lamk.;\r\n_Rottlera tinctoria_, Roxb.; _Mallotus Philippensis_, Müll.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Banato_, Tag.; _Buas_, _Vuas_, Iloc.; _Monkey-face Tree_,\r\n_Kamala_ or _Kamala Dye_, Indo-Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The capsular fruit of this plant is thickly beset with reddish\r\nglands and hairs, which, when brushed off and gathered in powder form,\r\nconstitute the _kamala dye_ of the Hindoos. It was mentioned by the\r\nArabian physicians of the tenth century under the names of _Kanbil_\r\nand _Wars_. In India the powder is highly valued as a yellow dye-stuff\r\nfor silk. Medicinally it is used as an anthelmintic, the English\r\nphysician Mackinnon, of the Bengal Hospital, having been the first to\r\nscientifically prove this property; he reported that it was successful\r\nin expelling the tape-worm. It is now official in the Pharmacopoeia\r\nof India and also in the U. S. P. as an anthelmintic and purgative;\r\nin Switzerland it is commonly given to expel the bothriocephalus\r\nwhich abounds there, the lake fish acting as hosts.\r\n\r\nThe dose recommended by the Pharmacopoeia of India is 8-12 grams,\r\ndivided in 3 or 4 doses. This amount sometimes causes nausea and\r\ncolic; in the third or fourth stool the tænia is commonly expelled\r\nin a lifeless condition. Dujardin-Beaumetz advises a dose of 30\r\ngrams of castor oil in case the tænia has not been expelled 2 hours\r\nafter the last dose of kamala. The powder is efficacious but the\r\ntincture seems to be surer; the dose is 6 grams for children and 20\r\nfor adults, given in divided doses in aromatic water every hour for\r\n6 hours. This tincture is prepared by macerating 200 grams of kamala\r\nin 500 cc. alcohol for 7 days; then filtering with expression and\r\nadding enough alcohol to complete the 500 cc.\r\n\r\nThe powder is also used in India as a local application in herpes\r\ncircinata. It is insoluble in water; in ether and alcohol it yields 80%\r\nof a red resin. Anderson noted that a concentrated ethereal solution of\r\nkamala after a few days formed a solid crystalline mass, yellow, very\r\nsoluble in ether; this substance he named _rottlerin_, C_11_H_10_O_3_.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 6-8 meters high, covered with\r\nstellate groups of short yellow hairs. Leaves alternate, petiolate,\r\nrhomboid-oval or lanceolate, acuminate, 3-nerved, entire or slightly\r\ndentate, upper surface glabrous, lower surface covered with woolly\r\nhairs and powdery red glands. Flowers yellowish-green, small,\r\ndioecious, apetalous, in spikes. Staminate: By 3's in the axil of each\r\nbract; perianth, 3 or 5 deeply cut, lanceolate lobules; stamens 15-25,\r\nfree, inserted in the center of the flower. Pistillate: In the axil\r\nof each bract; ovary, 3 locules each with 1 ovule, covered like the\r\nleaves with hairs and yellow, granular glands. Seed vessel globose,\r\n3-celled, like ovary covered with hairs and glands.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Mountains of Morong, San Mateo, Tarlak, Bosoboso, Ilocos\r\nNorte, Albay and Batangas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ricinus communis_, L. (Variety _microcarpus_, Müll.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Tangantangan_, _Lingasina_, Tag.; _Tangantangan_,\r\n_Tawatawasinga_, Iloc.; _Castor Oil Plant_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--A purgative oil is expressed from the seeds, called \"Aceite de\r\nRicino\" (castor oil). It operates mechanically in the intestinal tract\r\nand its action is rapid and is indicated whenever it is desired simply\r\nto empty the intestines without producing any irritating effect;\r\nit is, therefore, a purgative indicated in diseases of children,\r\nin pregnancy, and in hemorrhoidal congestions where a non-irritating\r\nevacuation of the rectum is desired. It is an anthelmintic, though\r\nnot ordinarily given alone, but in combination with other drugs of\r\na purely anthelmintic action, the object being to expel the worms\r\nwhich have been attacked by the specific.\r\n\r\nOil extracted simply by expression is less purgative than that obtained\r\nby treating the seeds with bisulphide of carbon and absolute alcohol;\r\nalso less purgative than the seeds themselves, because it contains only\r\na very small proportion of a drastic principle existing exclusively in\r\nthe seeds; this principle is completely dissolved in the oil extracted\r\nby chemical process.\r\n\r\nIt is pale yellow in color, very viscid, with a characteristic mouldy\r\nodor. The purgative dose is 10-30 grams. A small dose may purge as\r\nactively as a larger one provided that the patient drink abundantly\r\nafter the administration of the drug. The best method of disguising its\r\ntaste is by giving it in half a cup of very strong, hot coffee. Just\r\nbefore the dose, take a swallow of coffee to disguise the taste even\r\nmore effectually.\r\n\r\nCastor oil enters into the composition of elastic collodion (simple\r\ncollodion, 30 grams, castor oil, 2 grams). The leaves pounded and\r\nboiled are applied as a poultice to foul ulcers.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--There are two forms of this variety in\r\nthe Philippines, possessing the same properties and known by the\r\nsame common name: _R. viridis_, Müll. (_R. communis_, Blanco) and\r\n_R. subpurpurascens_, Müll.; the former is the more common and has\r\na glabrous, fistular stem. Leaves peltate, palmately cleft in 7 or\r\n9 lobules, lanceolate, serrate. Petioles long. Flowers greenish,\r\nmonoecious, the staminate ones in large panicled clusters below the\r\npistillate. Filaments numerous, subdivided into several anther-bearing\r\nbranches. Pistillate flowers, 3 sepals, 3 styles. Seed vessel,\r\n3 prickly capsules, containing solitary seeds.\r\n\r\nThe _R. subpurpurascens_ is distinguished from the former by bearing\r\n2 glandules at the base of the leaves, the mulberry color of which\r\nlatter suggests its common name, _Tangantangan na morado_, Tag., Vis.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in Luzon, Mindanao and other islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURTICACEÆ.\r\n\r\nNettle Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artocarpus integrifolia_, Willd.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Nangka_, Tag.; _Jack Fruit Tree_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The huge fruit of this tree is well known to the Filipinos\r\nand well liked by them as an article of food, eaten fresh or in sweet\r\npreserves. The arils and pulpy envelopes of the seeds are the parts\r\neaten, also the seeds themselves, boiled or roasted. According to\r\nPadre Mercado the roasted seeds have an aphrodisiac action.\r\n\r\nThe heated and powdered leaves are applied to wounds and given\r\ninternally for congestions. The resin of the trunk is a useful\r\napplication to ulcers and in India they give it internally to cure la\r\nmelena, the dose, one \"tola\" mixed with the same amount of _manga_\r\nresin and a little lime water. The same resin if heated makes an\r\nexcellent cement for broken china.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree, 20° or more in height, with abundant\r\nmilky sap. Leaves alternate, oval, acute at both ends, slightly wavy\r\nand revolute borders, tough, glabrous and dark green upper surface;\r\nlight green, slightly rough under surface. Petioles short. Flowers\r\ngreenish, monoecious, growing on root, trunk and branches. Calyx very\r\nsmall, monophyllous, of about 7 deciduous lobules. Staminate: On a\r\nclub-shaped receptacle, 3' or 4' long, bristling with the stamens;\r\nfilaments very short, anthers 2-celled. Pistillate: On a common,\r\noblong receptacle which ripens to the great fruit; style 1, short;\r\nrarely 2 divergent styles; stigmas acute. Fruit about size and shape\r\nof a small watermelon, beset with many sharp eminences, containing\r\nmany seeds enveloped in thick arils.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--It grows in all parts of the Archipelago and is commonly\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laportea gaudichaudiana_, Wedd. (_Urtica umbellata_, _U. ferox_,\r\nBlanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Lingaton_, _Lipa_, _Apariagua_ (?), Tag., Vis.;\r\n_Lipangdoton_, Pam.\r\n\r\nUses.--The Padre Mercado writes as follows concerning the properties of\r\nthis plant: \"The leaves, applied with salt in the form of a plaster,\r\npurify dog bites, foul, putrid, malignant and cankerous ulcers;\r\nthey cure boils, contusions and all abscesses; mixed with wax\r\nthey may be applied for obstruction of the spleen; mashed with the\r\njuice and inserted in the nose they arrest nose-bleed; cooked with\r\nsnails they soften the stomach, excite the secretion of urine and\r\ndissipate flatus; the juice given as a gargle aborts inflammation of\r\nthe epiglottis. The seeds mixed with wine are a sexual excitant and\r\n\"clear out\" the womb; taken with syrup they relieve dyspnoea, pain\r\nin the side and inflammation of the lungs and force up the humors\r\nfrom the chest; it may be mixed with medicines that corrupt the flesh\r\n(sic). The grated root drunk with wine relieves painful flatulence. I\r\nmyself (continues the Padre Mercado) have experimented with a woman\r\nwho suffered with painful flatulence and this remedy relieved her.\"\r\n\r\nWe repeat that all the foregoing is copied from the writings of Padre\r\nMercado and we offer it as a therapeutic curiosity.\r\n\r\nP. Blanco states that merely to touch the leaves causes an intolerable\r\nitching.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A small tree, 12-15° high, trunk richly\r\nbranched. Leaves opposite, bunched at the ends of the branches, notched\r\nat the base, long, ovate, serrate, hairy on both surfaces. Flowers\r\nyellowish-white, dioecious. Staminate: In compound racemes;\r\ncalyx 4 parts; corolla none; stamens 4, inserted on the base of the\r\ncalyx. Pistillate: Flowers in 2-forked umbel, flat, very large; calyx,\r\nnone; stamens none; stigma 1; seed heart-shaped.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in all the fields and in the mountains. Blooms\r\nin June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASUARINEÆ.\r\n\r\nBeefwood Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Casuarina Sumatrana_, Jung. (_C. equisetifolia_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Agoho_, Tag.; _Malabohok_, _Agoho_, Vis.; _Aro_, _Karo_,\r\n_Agoó_, Iloc.\r\n\r\nUses.--The bark is astringent by virtue of the large quantity of tannin\r\nit contains. Its principal use is in decoction in the treatment of\r\ndiarrhoea, dysentery and hæmoptysis; it is also given in amenorrhoea,\r\nthough it is apt to increase the pain. Externally it is used as a\r\nwash for contusions and ulcers.\r\n\r\nAnother species, _C. equisetifolia_, Forst., confounded with the\r\nformer species by the natives, has the same therapeutic applications.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree with stellately arranged straight\r\nbranches. Leaves stellate, long, narrow, linear, 4-grooved. They\r\nhave been compared to the tail of a horse and the tail of a certain\r\nbird--the casobar. Staminate and pistillate flowers greenish,\r\non different parts of the same stalk. Staminate, in small\r\naments. Pistillate on small globose aments; calyx proper of the\r\nfloweret, a coarse scale; corolla none; ovary conical; styles 2,\r\nflattened, divergent; stigmas acute. Fruit: Each floweret produces\r\na woody seed-vessel, bivalved, ovate, glabrous, with a small seed\r\nending in an oval wing; all these seed vessels joined form a small\r\ncone about 1' long.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in Ilocos, Tarlak, Binangonang of Lampong and\r\nN. Ecija.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOCOTYLEDONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSACEÆ.\r\n\r\nBanana Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Musa paradisiaca_, L.\r\n\r\n_M. sapientum_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg. _Plátano_, Sp.; _Saging_, Tag., etc.; _Banana_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The fruit produced by the various varieties of the banana\r\nplant constitutes one of the most wholesome and delicious of foods,\r\nappreciated by natives and Europeans alike. According to Boussingaul\r\nits nutritive value is greater than that of the potato and it may\r\nbe used constantly without ill effects. Bananas contain a large\r\npercentage of sugar and mucilage. In India they dry them in the sun,\r\nas figs and grapes are treated in other countries and thus preserve\r\nthem for long voyages by sea or land; eaten in conjunction with animal\r\nfood they are a strong preventive of scurvy. If eaten when thoroughly\r\nripe they have a laxative effect.\r\n\r\nThe young and tender leaves are used in the Philippines as a\r\nprotective dressing for ulcers, dermatitis, burns and cantharidal or\r\nother artificial blisters. Before applying to the affected surface\r\nthe leaf is heated to make it more flexible and coated with a thin\r\nlayer of cocoanut oil or other fatty substance.\r\n\r\nIn the dispensaries of India they also use the leaves in this way,\r\nthus protecting and at the same time maintaining the moisture of the\r\npart. Dr. Waring recommends the practice and Dr. Van Someren follows\r\nit in the application of water dressings, having substituted banana\r\nleaves for gutta-percha.\r\n\r\nIn Mauritius the fruit is used for dysentery, and the flowers,\r\ntogether with an equal quantity of those of _Spilanthes Acmella_,\r\nare made into a decoction and prescribed for dropsy.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The banana plant with its huge waving leaves\r\nand succulent stem is universally familiar. The flower stalk rises\r\nthrough the center developing a drooping spike, the flowers in short\r\nrows in the axils of its large purplish bracts. According to Blanco\r\nthere are 57 varieties of this plant in the Philippines, the following\r\nbeing the most common edible varieties: _bungulang_, _lakatan_,\r\n_letondang_, _obispo_, _higo_, _morado_, _butuan_, _bentikohol_,\r\n_sabá_, _tampuhing_.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common everywhere in the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZINGIBERACEÆ.\r\n\r\nGinger Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zingiber officinale_, L. (_Amomum zingiber_, L. and Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Ajengibre_, _Jengibre_, Sp.; _Luya_, Tag.; _Laya_, Bic.;\r\n_Ginger_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The rhizome is used principally as a condiment in the\r\nPhilippines. Its flavor is extremely agreeable, much appreciated\r\nin Europe by the English who are the greatest consumers of the\r\ncondiment. In the Philippines a decoction is made of ginger and\r\nbrown sugar, called _tahu_ by the Chinese who drink it regularly as\r\nwe do coffee in the early hours of the morning. It is an excellent\r\ndrink, aromatic, tonic, stomachic and stimulant, and would probably\r\nbe highly useful as well as economical as a part of the ration of\r\nEuropean and native troops in the field. Hot _tahú_ or _tahu_ is an\r\nactive diuretic; and during the last epidemic of cholera in Manila\r\nsome physicians used it with very satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nGinger is a good carminative and is official in the pharmacopoeias of\r\nEurope, America and India. It is used with good effect in flatulent\r\ncolic, atonic diseases of the intestines so common in the Philippines\r\nand in chronic rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThe tincture is given in doses of 2-4 grams. The official infusion\r\n30-60 grams.\r\n\r\nThe rhizome contains a volatile oil [10] (25 per cent.), a pale yellow\r\nliquid, specific gravity 0.878, the odor like that of the rhizome\r\nbut lacking its strong and piquant taste. Its reaction is not acid;\r\nit dissolves slowly in alcohol. The burning taste is due to a resin\r\nthat produces protocatechuic acid when melted with potassa.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The only part employed is the rhizome, well\r\nknown all over the islands and found in all their pharmacies and shops.\r\n\r\nSeveral stems rise 2-3° directly from the peculiar, branched rhizome;\r\nlong-lanceolate, acuminate, entire, glabrous, alternate leaves diverge\r\nstiffly from the sides of the stem; petiole proper very short, its\r\nbroader extension ensheathing the stem; general appearance of a single\r\nstem is much like that of the Solomon's seal so familiar in the U. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Curcuma longa_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Dilaw_, Tag.; _Dulaw_, _Kalawaga_, _Kinamboy_, Vis.;\r\n_Angay_, Pam.; _Turmeric Plant_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The yellow rhizome called by some _azafrán_ (saffron), is\r\nused as a condiment; its odor is remotely suggestive of vanilla. The\r\nPhilippine herb-doctors give it internally for hæmoptysis, externally\r\nas a plaster or in infusion for acute dermatitis. The juice is\r\nprescribed in doses of 30-60 grams in bronchial catarrh. In India\r\nthey inhale the fumes of burning turmeric paper for coryza, and with\r\ngood effect according to the testimony of Dr. Waring.\r\n\r\nThe drug is official in the Pharmacopoeia of India. It is carminative,\r\nstimulant and probably antiseptic. Its decoction is used as an eye-wash\r\nin catarrhal and purulent conjunctivitis. The Mohammedans of Deccan\r\nuse it for jaundice upon the theory that the yellow color of the skin\r\nin that disease is an indication for a remedy of the same color. The\r\njuice is also used in many parts of India to stain the face, nails\r\nand other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe tincture is prepared by macerating 30 grams of bruised rhizome\r\nin 200 cc. alcohol for seven days, then filtering. Turmeric paper is\r\nprepared by impregnating unsized paper with this tincture, and then\r\ndrying. Both tincture and paper are used to test for alkalies.\r\n\r\nThe rhizomes contain a pigment called curcumin, an essential oil and\r\nfæcula. Curcumin (C_14_H_14_O_4_) is crystalline, yellow by direct\r\nlight and blue by reflected light; it was studied by Jackson and Menke.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines it is used extensively as a diaphoretic and\r\nemmenagogue and in icterus, intestinal colic and dysmenorrhoea;\r\nexternally for skin diseases, contusions and atonic ulcers.\r\n\r\nGubler regards it as a diffusible stimulant. Its use is more extensive\r\nin England than in France and Spain; in India it forms an ingredient of\r\n_curry_, called _carí_ in Manila. Curcumin is eliminated by the urine,\r\nwhich it colors yellow, and if at the same time an alkali be taken by\r\nthe patient, especially a salt of calcium, the urine becomes red and\r\nmay communicate this stain to the clothes. This fact should be borne\r\nin mind to avoid embarrassing mistakes in diagnosis or prognosis. Dose\r\nof powder, 2-5 grams.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--Leaves 2-4° long, rising in bush-like bunches\r\ndirectly from the rhizome, broad-lanceolate, acuminate, gradually\r\ntapering down the long petioles; numerous prominent nerves give\r\na ribbed appearance to the blade. Rhizome cylindrical, irregular,\r\nbright yellow within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elettaria Cardamomum_, White.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Langkuas_, _Langkawas_, Vis.; _Cardamon_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant, though official in several pharmacopoeias, is not\r\nused as a medicine in the Philippines, probably on account of its\r\nscarcity here. The seeds are used as a condiment; they are stimulant\r\nand carminative and yield good results in atonic dyspepsia, nervous\r\ndepression and spasmodic or flatulent affections of the intestine. The\r\ndose of the powdered seeds is from 0.60-1.50 grams in pill form;\r\nthe tincture is, however, more convenient and is given in doses of\r\nfrom 4 to 8 grams.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant with a scaly rhizome and adventitious\r\nroots from which spring the stems, some of which bear leaves and\r\nothers flowers. The leaves are alternate, in pairs; extended,\r\nlanceolate blade, with a short petiole. Branches bearing flowers,\r\nshort, flexible and scaly. The flowers spring from the sheaths of\r\nthe leaves. Calyx tubular, 3-toothed; second calyx with limb divided\r\ninto 3 unequal lobules. Stamens 3. Ovary inferior, 3 many-ovuled\r\ncompartments. Style simple. Stigma rounded. Fruit an oblong, ovoid\r\ncapsule, 3-celled, trivalvate. Seeds blackish, albuminous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Visayan Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMARYLLIDACEÆ.\r\n\r\nAmaryllis Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crinum Asiaticum, L._ (_C. giganteum_, Blanco.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bakong_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The decoction of the leaves is used in the Philippines as an\r\nexpectorant. The plant is official in the Pharmacopoeia of India as\r\nan emetic and in small doses is nauseant and diaphoretic. As an emetic\r\nthe dose of the fresh juice of the root is 8-16 grams every 10 minutes\r\ntill vomiting occurs. Dr. W. O'Shaughnessy, writing from Bengal, states\r\nthat this is the only indigenous and abundant emetic plant of which\r\nhe has experience, which acts without producing griping, purging, or\r\nother unpleasant symptoms. In a communication to Dr. Waring he remarks\r\nthat it is a good emetic and diaphoretic whenever ipecacuanha is not\r\nat hand but that it should be regarded not so much as a substitute\r\nfor that article as a resource in case of need.\r\n\r\nThe leaf juice is used in India to drop into the ears for disease of\r\nthese organs.\r\n\r\nOne of the infinite remedies used by the Filipinos under the name\r\nof \"contrapoisons,\" without specifying or knowing what poison,\r\nis the powdered root of _Crinum_, given internally with a little\r\nwater. They also use the leaves locally for the itch, bruising them\r\nand rubbing the affected parts energetically with them. I may note\r\nhere in passing, what I have written before: that the Filipinos have\r\nfrom time immemorial been familiar with the sarcopt of scabies (Kahaw)\r\nwhich they pick out with a needle or spine of some fish or vegetable.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A plant with globose, scaly root. Leaves\r\nkeeled or ridged. Flowers white, on a flattened stalk, on a spathe\r\nof 2 leaflets and several dry threads enclosing 4 flowerets. Corolla\r\nfunnel-form, tube long and triangular; limb cut in 6 horizontal\r\nlanceolate lobes. Stamens 6, shorter than corolla. Anthers long. Stigma\r\nwith 3 points. Seed vessel inferior, 3-celled, each cell containing\r\na seed.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Very common on the seashore and in groves of mangrove\r\ntrees. Blooms in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLILIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nLily Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aloes Barbadensis_, Mill. (_A. humilis_, Blanco; _A. vera_, L.;\r\n_A. vulgaris_, Banck.; _A. Indica_, Royl.)\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Sabila_, Tag.; _Dilang boaya_, Vis.; _Aloes_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This species is one of those which produce the substance known\r\nin pharmacy as _aloes_, which is the juice of the leaf evaporated to\r\nthe consistency of an extract. It is official in all pharmacopoeias\r\nand its properties are known to the Filipino herb-doctors. They\r\nuse the fresh juice of the leaves as a stimulant of the scalp in\r\nbaldness and locally in contusions. Aloes is a slow purgative and\r\nits irritating action on the lower portion of the large intestine\r\nextends to the genito-urinary organs. It is, therefore, an emmenagogue\r\nand its prolonged use causes hemorrhoids, especially in man. It is\r\ncontraindicated where there is disease of the genito-urinary organs\r\nor rectum. As it increases the secretion of bile it is useful in\r\ncertain hepatic diseases. It is used in small doses as a tonic in\r\ndyspepsia. The tonic dose is 1/2-20 centigrams; purgative, 15-50 of\r\nthe extract, preferably in pill form. It is customary to associate\r\nit with other purgatives.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A stemless plant, the leaves springing\r\nimmediately from the root as in the pineapple, joined at the base,\r\nstraight, ligulate, very fleshy and becoming thinner toward the end,\r\nwith stiff thorns along the edges. Flowers between yellow and red\r\noutside and straw-colored inside, in racemes on a cylindrical scape\r\n3° or more high, sometimes ramose, peduncles very short. Corolla\r\ncylindrical, somewhat incurved, cleft to the middle in 6 parts, 3\r\nexternal, acute and superposed on the others, obtuse at the apex and\r\nof different color. Stamens 6, inserted at the nectiferous base of\r\nthe ovary and of the same length as the corolla. Anthers erect. Ovary\r\ncylindrical with 6 furrows. Stigma obtuse, with raveled edges. The\r\nseed vessel ovoid, 3-valved, 3-celled, with 2 seeds in each, furnished\r\nwith 3 spongy wings.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Allium sativum_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Ajo_, Sp.; _Bawang_, Tag.; _Garlic_, Eng.\r\n\r\n_Allium Cepa_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Cebolla_, Sp.; _Lasuna_, _Sibuyas_, Tag.; _Onion_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The garlic and the onion are used to excess as condiments\r\nin Philippine as well as Spanish cooking. Both are difficult of\r\ndigestion and communicate a very disagreeable odor to the breath,\r\nintolerable to those who are unaccustomed to it. Garlic possesses\r\nthe singular property, familiar to many students and soldiers,\r\nof inducing a transient fever if introduced within the anus. When\r\nbruised and applied to the skin it has a counter-irritant action which\r\nmakes it useful in the treatment of rheumatism, but the odor is so\r\ndisagreeable that it is not worth while to use it for that purpose\r\nwhen we have so many other medicines which produce the same effect\r\nwithout being objectionable. It is also used locally for the bites\r\nof venomous animals.\r\n\r\nThe onion is used cooked as a poultice over the bladder and internally\r\nfor various catarrhs. It is better to abstain from the therapeutic\r\nand culinary use of products so indigestible and so malodorous.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--These plants are so well known in all parts\r\nof the world that a description of them would be superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALMÆ.\r\n\r\nPalm Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Areca Catechu_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Bonga_, Tag.; _Betel-nut Palm_, _Areca_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The seeds form part of a masticatory very common throughout\r\nthe extreme Orient, known as _Buyo_ and composed of a betel leaf,\r\na little slaked lime, and a slice of the fruit of the bonga, known\r\nas _Siri_ in Indo-China and among the Malays. It is so common that\r\nit is hard to find a man or woman who does not use it. The saliva\r\nof those who use it is red and of a strong odor, and its careless\r\nuse in time blackens the teeth and makes the breath extremely\r\ndisagreeable. Habitual chewers consider it a tonic of the mouth and\r\nstomach and a general stimulant as well. It probably does possess\r\nthese properties but they are reversed in the case of persons who\r\nuse it immoderately for they lose appetite, become salivated, and\r\nthe whole organism degenerates. The carbonized and powdered fruit\r\nis used as a dentifrice but its virtues are doubtless identical with\r\nthose of any vegetable charcoal, _i. e._, absorbent and antiseptic.\r\n\r\nOne unaccustomed to the use of bonga and chewing it for the first time,\r\nusually experiences a most disagreeable combination of symptoms;\r\nconstriction of the oesophagus, a sensation of heat in the head\r\nand face, the latter becoming red and congested; at the same time\r\ndizziness and precordial distress are experienced. The same phenomena\r\noccur in certain persons after eating palmito salad or the tender\r\ncentral portion of the bonga and of other palms.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are eaten in salad like the above-mentioned _palmito_. The\r\nseed is astringent and tænifuge; for the latter purpose it is given\r\ninternally as a powder in a dose of from 16 to 24 grams. Its action\r\nis uncertain. The catechu which is obtained in India from the Bonga\r\ndiffers from that obtained from the _Acacia Catechu_ and is a tonic\r\nanalogous to rhatany and cinchona.\r\n\r\nThe seeds contain about 14% of a fatty crystalline material which\r\nmelts at 39°, and after saponification yields a crystalline, fatty acid\r\nthat may be regarded as a mixture of lauric and muriatic acids. They\r\nalso contain about 14% of a red, amorphous tonic material which,\r\nafter drying, is but slightly soluble in cold or hot water.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the petiole of the leaves is thin and broad,\r\nensheathing the trunk, is as tough as pasteboard when dry and is used\r\nin the Philippines as wrapping paper; Dr. Bholanauth Bose and other\r\nphysicians of India use it as a material for splints in fractures,\r\na practice which might well be imitated in Manila and especially in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A well-known palm with slender stem, surrounded\r\nby many circles; it grows to about the same height as the coco-nut palm\r\nor less. The flowers spring in bunches of long, thread-like spikes from\r\nthe trunk a little below the crown of leaves at the base of the long,\r\nsmooth, green, sheath-like petioles which clasp the trunk; each spike\r\nbears many staminate and a few pistillate flowers. The fruit is about\r\nthe size and shape of a hen's egg, the husk tow-like or filamentose,\r\nthe kernel pinkish or light red.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Grows throughout the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cocos nucifera_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Coco_, Sp.-Fil.; _Niog_, Tag.; _Coco-nut Palm_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--This plant is, perhaps, the most useful in the\r\nPhilippines. Without it and the bamboo plant the people of the\r\nArchipelago would not know how to live. It produces vinegar, an\r\nalcoholic drink called _tuba_ or _coco-wine_, an oil, an edible nut,\r\nand its leaves are used instead of nipa to roof the huts.\r\n\r\nTuba is an opaline, slightly sweet liquid, with an agreeable taste,\r\nwhich rapidly becomes acid under the influence of the heat. A flowering\r\nor fruit-bearing stalk, which has not been incised before, is chosen\r\nand encircled with several rings of rope or rattan. The stalk is then\r\ncut and a bamboo vessel called a _bombón_ is hung to receive the sap\r\nwhich escapes during the night. This liquid is valuable as a drink\r\nfor those who are debilitated, suffering from pulmonary catarrh, and\r\neven for consumptives, who are accustomed to drink it every morning,\r\nsometimes with marvelous results, according to reports. The heat of\r\nthe day rapidly ferments the tuba, converting it into a mild vinegar,\r\nwhich is widely used for domestic purposes in the Philippines. When\r\nfermented and distilled it produces a weak alcohol of disagreeable\r\ntaste called coco-wine.\r\n\r\nThe ripe fruit contains a rather soft and savory meat which is\r\ngenerally eaten mixed with the clear, sweet coco-nut milk. Later the\r\nmeat becomes firmer and is used as a food and an oil much used in the\r\nislands is extracted from it. To extract the oil the meat is grated\r\nand pressed until all the juice is extracted. This is called the milk\r\nand when boiled is converted almost completely into oil. Cocoanut\r\nmilk has an agreeable taste and may in some cases take the place of\r\ncow's milk. It is apt to produce diarrhoea, however, which action\r\nmay be bad for some but on the other hand good for others, such as\r\nthe habitually constipated. Both the meat and the milk are widely\r\nused by the natives in making sweets.\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of the islands it is the only oil used for\r\nillumination. As a medicine it is employed internally as a purgative\r\nand externally in the treatment of scores of troubles in which the\r\ngood results obtained are due, not to the oil but to the massage used\r\nin rubbing it in. It has the reputation of stimulating the growth\r\nof the hair and all the natives and some Europeans use it lavishly\r\nas a hair ointment. When fresh its odor is agreeable, but it easily\r\nbecomes rancid and assumes a most disagreeable odor. In the Visayan\r\nIslands they make an oil of a nauseous odor which they call in Manila\r\n_Caracoa_. It is used only for illumination and by the poor.\r\n\r\nAt a temperature of 20° or more the oil remains liquid; it is colorless\r\nwhen fresh and properly extracted. It solidifies at 18° and two kinds\r\nof soap are made of it; one soft and exceedingly cheap called \"Quiapo\";\r\nthe other hard, white, of a high quality, but as a rule containing\r\nan excess of lime which in time is deposited in a fluorescent film\r\non its surface.\r\n\r\nIn India the root is employed in the treatment of dysentery.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A tree most familiar to every one.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in all parts of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nipa fruticans_, Wurmb.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Nipa_, Sp.-Fil.; _Sasa_, Tag.\r\n\r\nUses.--The dry leaves of this palm are generally used in the villages\r\nof Manila Province, Pampanga, Bulacan and other provinces in the\r\nconstruction of roofs and walls of houses, which are therefore called\r\n\"nipa houses.\" The decoction of the fresh leaves is used as a lotion\r\nfor indolent ulcers, and a popular preserve is made from the fruit.\r\n\r\nLike the coco and following the same process the nipa yields a liquid\r\nalso called tuba and possessing properties identical with those of\r\nthe former plant. The weak alcohol distilled from it has some repute\r\nin the treatment of conjunctivitis, for which purpose a few drops are\r\nmixed with a small quantity of water and the eyes are washed with it\r\nseveral times a day. This alcohol, improperly called wine of nipa,\r\nhas a characteristically unpleasant odor which makes it impracticable\r\nfor medicinal or industrial use. Several chemists have attempted to\r\nremove the characteristic odor from nipa alcohol, but their results\r\nhad always been negative because the odorous principle was distilled\r\nover at the same temperature as the alcohol. Finally a distinguished\r\nFilipino chemist, D. Anacleto del Rosario, perfected a process of\r\nproducing from the nipa tuba an absolute alcohol perfectly free from\r\nthe characteristic odor; an alcohol, in fact, possessing all the\r\nqualities of chemically pure alcohol, and of such a high grade that\r\nit was awarded the first prize at the last World's Fair in Paris.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--A palm about 6° high with long, pinnate leaves\r\nwith leaflets which separate, at maturity, like those of the coco\r\npalm. Flowers monoecious, in a spathe. Fruit, many pyramidal drupes\r\njoined together, but easily separable. The outer covering of each\r\ndrupe is hard, the inner part tow-like; seed enveloped in a sort of\r\nfleshy white meat.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Salt water marshes, especially in Pampanga and the Visayan\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYPERACEÆ.\r\n\r\nSedge Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyperus rotundus_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Mutha_, Tag.; _Botobotones_, Vis.; _Mota_, _Malaapolid_,\r\n_Sursur_, _Onoran_, _Kusung_, _Omadiung_, _Galonalpas_, Pam.;\r\n_Nutgrass_ or _Coco-grass_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The root possesses stimulant, diaphoretic, diuretic and\r\nemmenagogue properties. In the Philippines it is used internally for\r\ndysentery, and in India for the same purpose and as a vermifuge. It is\r\ngiven as a tonic in gastro-intestinal diseases, and General Hardwick\r\nhas reported good results with it in cholera; as he reported only\r\ntwo cases, his testimony is not of much value.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese use the dry or roasted root, especially in inflammation of\r\nthe viscera and uterine diseases. They also attribute to it diuretic,\r\nemmenagogue and anthelmintic properties. In Java and India they use it\r\nfor gonorrhoea, and in Mauritius as a diaphoretic and astringent. In\r\nthe Philippines the bruised root is applied to the face for toothache.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--The root is ovoid, ranging in size from that\r\nof a hazel-nut to that of a walnut, composed of a white, spongy\r\nsubstance. Leaves sword-shaped, ensheathing the stem. Flowers in\r\na compound umbel on the end of the stalk which is naked, long and\r\ntriangular. The umbellets are alternate, awl-shaped, with distinct\r\nflowers. Calyx universal, with 2 sword-shaped leaflets. Calyx proper,\r\na very small, ridged scale. Corolla none. Stamens 3. Filaments long,\r\ninserted on the base of the ovary. Anthers long and straight. Style\r\n1. Stigmas 3, simple, revolute. Fruit 1. Seed oblong, 3-sided,\r\nglabrous.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Common in Luzon and Panay. Blooms in June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAMINEÆ.\r\n\r\nGrass Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zea Mays_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Maíz_, Sp.; _Maize_, _Corn_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--Corn is an extensive article of diet in the Philippines,\r\nbut has the reputation of being indigestible. This is true when it\r\nis eaten in the grain, but in the form of meal it is easily digested\r\nand highly nutritious. The tassels have been used in the Philippines\r\nfrom time immemorial in decoction as a diuretic, for which property\r\nthey received notice in the _Medical World_ of Paris about the year\r\n1876. The entire plant is diuretic and the natives give the decoction\r\nof the stalk for various diseases of the bladder and kidneys. An\r\nextract of the tassels has been put on the market, but it is better\r\nto administer a decoction made from 20 grams of tassel to 1 liter of\r\nwater to be taken at will during the day. Rademaker and Fischer give\r\nthe following chemical composition:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Fixed oil                                   5.25\r\n        Resin, crystalline matter and chlorophyl    3.25\r\n        Maizenic acid                               2.25\r\n        Sugar and gum                              19.50\r\n        Albuminoids                                 3.50\r\n        Salts and extracts                          5.50\r\n        Cellulose                                  37.00\r\n        Water                                      20.00\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fixed oil is bright yellow, saponifiable by potash, soluble in\r\nchloroform and ether, insoluble in alcohol, solidifies at 10°.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Very common in all parts of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Andropogon Schoenanthes_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Salay_, _Tanglad_, Tag.; _Paja de Meca_, Sp.-Fil.;\r\n_Baliyoko_, Vis.; _Geranium Grass_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The Filipino women use the leaves to perfume their gogo\r\nhair-wash. The decoction of the leaves is used internally as a diuretic\r\n(10 grams to a liter of water) and also to bathe pregnant women. The\r\nroots also are diuretic.\r\n\r\nA Manila pharmacist, D. Rosendo García, has obtained a good quality of\r\nthe fixed oil of this plant. In India they call this essence _rusa_,\r\n_geranium_ and _gin-gembre_ (nimar oil, Eng.); the annual export\r\nfrom Bombay is over 40,000 English pounds. It is dextrogyrous and\r\nits formula is C_5_H_4_.\r\n\r\nAnother species, the _A. nardus_, L., commonly called \"raiz de mora\"\r\n(mulberry root), \"citronella,\" Eng., possesses the same therapeutic\r\nproperties as the former. It also possesses an agreeable perfume\r\nand yields an essential oil, which, like rusa, is used to adulterate\r\nAttar of Roses.\r\n\r\nThe dried root is widely used in the Philippines and in Europe as\r\nwell, to preserve clothing from moths and other destructive insects,\r\nat the same time giving them a sweet odor. In India the decoction is\r\nused internally, 10 grams to a liter of water, in the treatment of\r\nrheumatism and as a diuretic.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--An indigenous grass with sword-shaped leaves\r\nabout 4° high, tapering at the base, possessing a sweet odor. Root\r\nthick, irregular, rough, formed by the union of several small rootlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saccharum officinarum_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Cañamiel_, _Caña de azúcar_, _Caña dulc_, Sp.; _Tubo_,\r\nTag.; _Sugar Cane_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--The Filipinos are very fond of the fresh cane. The juice,\r\nwhich is extracted by means of primitive wooden presses, is used\r\nas a drink mixed with lemon juice or vino and is sold in markets\r\nand public places as a popular beverage on hot days. A tepid juice,\r\nextracted from heated cane is given for catarrhal troubles. This use\r\nof the juice is the only one peculiar to the Philippines. Its general\r\nuse and properties are universally familiar and are amply treated in\r\nthe materia medica.\r\n\r\nBotanical Description.--This plant is so universally familiar that\r\nit is unnecessary to describe it. More than 20 varieties are found\r\nin the Philippines.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--Throughout the islands, especially in the Island of Negros\r\nand the Luzon Provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan and Nueva Ecija.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oriza_, L.\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Arroz_, Sp.; _Palay_, Tag. (the plant and the unhusked\r\nrice); _Bigas_, Tag. (the husked rice); _Rice_, Eng.\r\n\r\nUses.--All the people of Indo-China, China, Japan and the greater\r\npart of the Indian Archipelago eat rice as Europeans do bread.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines an immense variety of rice grows and in the World's\r\nFair at Paris, in 1889, Señor D. Regino García, of Manila, presented\r\na unique collection of 147 varieties. The rice grown in high lands\r\nabove irrigation is called \"arroz de secano\" and mountain rice, and\r\nthat grown in low and irrigated land is called \"arroz de sementera\"\r\nand swamp rice. The two kinds are equally valuable as food.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of starch in rice is large, but it contains but a\r\nsmall amount of gluten, and therefore a large amount must be eaten\r\nin order to obtain sufficient nutritive elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Water                                       5.00\r\n        Starch                                     85.07\r\n        Parenchyma                                  4.80\r\n        Nitrogenous matter                          3.68\r\n        Crystallizable sugar                        0.29\r\n        Gummy matter                                1.71\r\n        Oil                                         0.13\r\n        Phosphate of lime                           0.40\r\n        Chloride of potash, phosphate of potash,\r\n        acetic acid, calcareous vegetable salt,\r\n        salt of potash, sulphur                     Traces.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Filipino therapeutics rice has an extensive use, especially in\r\nthe form of a decoction called _cange_, which is commonly given in the\r\ntreatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, with good results. Cooked as a\r\nsort of mush it may be used as a substitute for linseed poultices and\r\nhas the great advantage of not becoming rancid. Roasted and powdered\r\nit is dusted upon wounds or abrasions of the skin and forms a dry\r\nand absorbent covering under which they heal rapidly.\r\n\r\nIt has lately been claimed that beriberi is due to a microorganism\r\nfound in rice under certain abnormal conditions; this claim is not\r\nyet firmly established and beriberi is still one of the many problems\r\nin medicine which are awaiting solution.\r\n\r\nHabitat.--All parts of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAMBUSEÆ.\r\n\r\nBamboo Family.\r\n\r\n\r\nNom. Vulg.--_Caña_, Sp.; _Bamboo_, Eng.\r\n\r\nLinnæus and Blanco include in the genus _Bambus_ all the different\r\nspecies of bamboo to which the Spaniards have given the general name\r\nof _caña_. The plant is of incomparable value to the natives of the\r\nPhilippines; they build their houses of it, make agricultural and\r\nindustrial instruments of it, use it in all the varied apparatus\r\nof their fisheries and for a multitude of household utensils and\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nThe variety _B. arundinacea_, Retz. (_B. arundo_, Blanco),\r\n_Kawayag-totóo_, Tag., is the largest and most generally employed\r\nin making houses and furniture. The tender shoots prepared in lime\r\nwater are edible but have the deserved reputation of being difficult\r\nof digestion.\r\n\r\nThe variety _Schizostachyum acutiflorum_, Munro (_B. diffusa_, Blanco),\r\n_Osiw_, _Bokawy_, Tag., is less used. The shoots are used to treat\r\nopacity of the cornea, for which purpose they are cut when about a\r\npalm in height, the outer leaves removed, and the center soaked over\r\nnight with a little sugar candy. The following day the water in the\r\nbottom of the jar is collected and used to paint the cornea.\r\n\r\nThe variety _Dendrocalamus sericens_, Munro (_B. mitis_, Blanco),\r\n_Taywanak_, Tag., is also used in medicine. Its abundant sap is given\r\ninternally in the treatment of phthisis.\r\n\r\nAll of the above species and the _Dendrocalamus flagellifer_, Munro\r\n(_B. levis_, Blanco), _Boho_, Tag., produce at their joints a hard\r\nporcelain-like substance, friable, of opaline color, called \"bamboo\r\nstone\" or \"tabashir\" in India, where, as well as in the Philippines\r\nand Indo-China, it has great repute among the popular remedies. It is\r\ngiven in venereal diseases, hiccough, hemorrhage, fevers and other\r\ndiseases. As a matter of fact, it is an almost inert substance, the\r\nimaginary virtues of which originated, doubtless, in the apparently\r\nremarkable fact that a stone (?) was produced inside of a vegetable.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of M. Guibourt is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Silicon                    96.04\r\n        Water                       2.94\r\n        Lime and potassium          0.13\r\n        Organic material          Traces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF PLANTS\r\n\r\nACCORDING TO THERAPEUTIC PROPERTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alteratives._--Anona muricata.--Tinospora crispa.--Raphanus\r\nsativus.--Bombax malabaricus.--Oxalis corniculata.--Citrus acida\r\nand C.
