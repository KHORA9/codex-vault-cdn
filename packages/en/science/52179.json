Mathews III[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the early Spanish explorers who first saw Palo Duro Canyon, today’s\r\nvisitor is likely to view the impressive canyon with surprise and awe.\r\nThis great depression—it is more than 2 miles wide and as much as 800\r\nfeet deep within park boundaries—contains a fascinating assortment of\r\nmulticolored geologic formations and erosion-produced rock sculptures of\r\nmany shapes, colors, and size. The geographic setting of the canyon\r\nfurther heightens its impact on the visitor, for it is surrounded by the\r\nlevel, virtually treeless plains of the Texas Panhandle. (_See_ upper\r\nbackground area in fig. 1, frontispiece).\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that this scenic area has been set aside as a State\r\npark, for Palo Duro Canyon has long been of interest to man. First, as\r\nthe hunting grounds of prehistoric Indians who stalked the now-extinct\r\nIce Age mammoths and bison that roamed the valley floor. Later, the\r\ncanyon was frequented by the Comanches, Apaches, Kiowas, and other\r\nIndians of historic time. These tribes, like those before them, found\r\nboth food and refuge within the canyon. However, it was not until 1876\r\nthat Palo Duro Canyon was inhabited by the white man. It was during this\r\nyear that pioneer cattleman Charles Goodnight herded some 1,600 head of\r\ncattle into the canyon and established a camp there (p. 6).\r\n\r\nToday’s visitor to Palo Duro Canyon can re-live some of the fascinating\r\nhistory of this interesting area. One can still see a replica of Colonel\r\nGoodnight’s primitive dugout, follow the faint trace of the Comanche\r\nTrail, or perhaps find the fossil bones of prehistoric creatures that\r\nlived hundreds of thousands—even millions—of years ago. But most\r\nvisitors to Texas’ most colorful canyon are not attracted by its\r\ninteresting history. They come instead to enjoy the scenery and\r\nrecreational opportunities that are present. These are readily\r\naccessible, for a carefully engineered, hard-surface road leads from the\r\nrim of the canyon to the canyon floor. There are campgrounds, picnic\r\nareas, concessions, and even an outdoor theatre (fig. 23). The location\r\nof these facilities and some of the canyon’s more interesting geologic\r\nfeatures are shown on the generalized place map of the canyon (fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThis publication does not attempt to describe the scenic beauty of Palo\r\nDuro Canyon, for this must be seen to be appreciated. Rather, it\r\ndiscusses the geologic setting and origin of the canyon, the methods by\r\nwhich some of the more interesting geologic features were formed, and\r\nbriefly reviews the history of the area. Hopefully, it will enable the\r\nvisitor to understand better the meaning behind the canyon scenery,\r\nthereby enhancing his visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people have assisted in the preparation of _The Geologic Story of\r\nPalo Duro Canyon_, and their help is gratefully acknowledged: Professor\r\nJack T. Hughes, Dr. Frank W. Daugherty, Dr. Robert C. Burton, Meade\r\nHumphries, and Jim Hughes of the West Texas State University Geology\r\nDepartment provided much information about the area and assisted in the\r\nfield; help was also provided by Mr. Pete Cowart, Mr. Earl Burtz, Mr.\r\nJerry Tschauner, Mr. Bob Watson, Mr. King, and other park personnel; Mr.\r\nC. Boone McClure, of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, furnished\r\nsome of the photographs; Mr. J. Dan Scurlock, Mr. Bill Collins, and Mr.\r\nHarold Allums, of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, made\r\navailable certain maps and statistical data; Mrs. Ples Harper of Canyon\r\nassisted in assembling information and photographs for the Pioneer\r\nAmphitheatre; and the aerial photograph of Palo Duro Canyon was taken by\r\nMr. W. A. Hester and made available through the courtesy of Mr. Charles\r\nA. Wolflin of Amarillo.\r\n\r\nDrs. Peter T. Flawn, Peter U. Rodda, and Ross A. Maxwell of the Bureau\r\nof Economic Geology read much of the manuscript and offered many helpful\r\nsuggestions, and Mr. A. Richard Smith provided special information on\r\ncaves in the Palo Duro area. Special thanks are due to Miss Josephine\r\nCasey who edited the manuscript and to Mr. J. W. Macon, cartographer,\r\nwho assumed responsibility for preparing the maps. Thanks are due also\r\nto my wife, Jennie, who critically read the manuscript and took a number\r\nof the photographs. Finally, I would like to thank Dr. J. Daniel Powell\r\nof The University of Texas at Arlington for invaluable assistance in the\r\nfield and his enthusiastic co-operation throughout the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PARK HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nPalo Duro Canyon’s long and colorful past has created considerable\r\ninterest among historians, archeologists, and geologists. Historians\r\nhave traced the written history of man and his effect on the Palo Duro\r\narea, but archeologists have delved much further into the past. They\r\nhave sought out and studied the more enduring records of the canyon’s\r\nearly inhabitants—their tools, utensils, and weapons. The geologist,\r\nhowever, is interested in history that far antedates even the most\r\nprimitive human inhabitant of the canyon. The earth scientist has probed\r\nthe geologic record of the Palo Duro area, using rocks, minerals, and\r\nfossils as clues to the geologic history and development of the canyon.\r\n\r\nPalo Duro Canyon is unique among Texas’ State parks because of its many\r\ncontributions to history, archeology, and geology. Here the written\r\nrecord, the artifacts of prehistoric man, and the geologic formations\r\noverlap and complement each other in many respects. Although this\r\nguidebook is primarily concerned with the geologic history of the\r\ncanyon, a brief review of its human history is also included.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ANCIENT MAN IN PALO DURO CANYON\r\n\r\nArcheological studies indicate that the earliest known inhabitants of\r\nPalo Duro Canyon lived in the canyon from about 10,000 to 5,000 B.C.\r\nThese early men apparently hunted the bison and now-extinct\r\nelephant-like mammoths that roamed the Palo Duro area during the Ice Age\r\nof Pleistocene time (_see_ geologic time scale, fig. 6). Their stone\r\nweapons and other artifacts have been found in and around the canyon. It\r\nis assumed that these primitive people—like those who came later—were\r\nattracted by the streams and springs that are found in the canyon and by\r\ngame that came there to feed. There is also evidence that the Indians\r\ntook advantage of certain of the canyon’s geologic features. They\r\nfashioned tools, weapons, and utensils from the rocks exposed in the\r\ncanyon and used certain of the shallow caves and rock shelters as their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         INDIANS OF THE PLAINS\r\n\r\nVarious tribes of Plains Indians of historic times also used Palo Duro\r\nCanyon as a camping ground. The presence of these Indians is known from\r\nmany campsites and burials. In addition, flint chips and stone\r\nartifacts, potsherds, ornaments of shell and bone, grinding slabs, stone\r\nmortars (fig. 15), and a few pictographs (fig. 3) have provided\r\nconsiderable information about the culture of these people. Among the\r\ntribes believed to have frequented the canyon at various times are the\r\nApaches, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Kiowas, and Comanches. However, it is the\r\nComanches who are most closely associated with the Palo Duro area, for\r\nthe canyon is located near the center of their last homeland. Indeed it\r\nwas here that the Comanches were finally defeated and driven from this\r\npart of the Plains. The battlefield where Colonel Ranald Mackenzie’s\r\ntroops fought the Comanches is located near the southeast corner of the\r\npark (_see_ fig. 7). This skirmish, which took place in 1874, is\r\nbelieved to have been the last major Indian battle in Texas.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the canyon’s archeological sites have been picked over\r\nand many of the artifacts removed, important finds are still\r\noccasionally reported. Park visitors who make discoveries of this type\r\nare urged to report them to a park ranger in order that they might be\r\ncalled to the attention of the proper authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ADVENT OF THE WHITE MAN\r\n\r\nAlthough the history of Palo Duro Canyon is rich in Indian lore, it was\r\nthe coming of the white man that heralded the development of the area.\r\nToday it is generally believed that Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was\r\nthe first white man to view the canyon. Coronado and his men are thought\r\nto have camped here during the winter of 1541, as they crossed the High\r\nPlains in search of the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Place map of Palo Duro Canyon.]\r\n\r\nLater, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the canyon was a favorite\r\nresting place of the buffalo hunters and Indian traders who frequented\r\nthe Plains. The canyon was also popular during the first half of the\r\n19th century, for it was then that it was occupied by the Comanches and\r\nserved as a trade center for the Spaniards and Indians who came from New\r\nMexico. These traders, called _comancheros_, bartered for loot taken by\r\nthe Comanches on their raids of early settlements and wagon trains that\r\npassed through the Panhandle-Plains region.\r\n\r\nThis same era marked the beginning of American interest in the Palo Duro\r\ncountry. During this period the area was visited by several expeditions\r\nincluding those of Long and Pike and the Texas-Santa Fe Expedition of\r\n1841. However, the canyon was not fully explored or mapped until 1852.\r\nThis important survey was carried out by a party which was under the\r\nsupervision of Captain R. B. Marcy.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until 1876 that the first white man established permanent\r\nresidence in Palo Duro Canyon. In 1876—just two years after McKenzie’s\r\nrout of the Comanches—Colonel Charles Goodnight herded more than 1,600\r\nhead of cattle into the canyon. Here he laid out his first permanent\r\nranch and lived in a primitive earthen dugout. Not only was Goodnight’s\r\nPalo Duro Ranch the first in the canyon, it is also thought to have been\r\nthe first commercial cattle ranch in the Texas Panhandle. In later years\r\nColonel Goodnight formed a partnership with John Adair of Ireland, and\r\ntogether they developed the famous JA Ranch—a vast spread of some\r\n600,000 acres. Today’s visitor to Palo Duro Canyon can visit a partially\r\nrestored dugout similar to that occupied by the canyon’s early settlers\r\n(fig. 30).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3. The face carved on this boulder can be seen\r\n    along the track of the Sad Monkey Railroad (p. 35). It is believed\r\n    to have been carved by Indians.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.

It was, nonetheless, a\r\nfavorite picnic and camping spot of the residents of nearby towns and\r\ncities. In 1933 the recreational potential of the canyon was finally\r\nrecognized and land for the Palo Duro Canyon State Park was purchased by\r\nthe State of Texas with money obtained through a public revenue bond\r\nissue. Today, most of the park revenue received through gate admissions,\r\nconcession receipts, and mineral leases goes into a fund that pays off\r\nthe remaining balance of the revenue bonds. During the initial phase of\r\nthe park’s development, most of the improvements in the area were made\r\nby members of the Civilian Conservation Corps who worked under the\r\nsupervision of the National Park Service.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Palo Duro Canyon State Park is visited by approximately\r\n300,000 visitors each year and is one of the State’s more popular\r\nrecreational and scenic areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            REGIONAL SETTING\r\n\r\n\r\nPalo Duro Canyon State Park is located in the Panhandle of Texas (fig.\r\n5) approximately 13 miles east of Canyon on State Highway 217 (_see_\r\nfig. 7). It is about 12 miles south and 8 miles east of Amarillo via\r\nRanch Road 1541 which intersects State Highway 217. The park includes\r\nmore than 15,000 acres of Palo Duro Canyon, a complexly dissected area\r\nwhich spreads into Randall, Armstrong, and Briscoe counties.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the Palo Duro area is situated on the Llano Estacado\r\nor High Plains area which comprises approximately 20,000 square miles of\r\nTexas and New Mexico (_see_ fig. 5). Generally speaking, the Llano\r\nEstacado is a high isolated plateau or broad mesa, rising above the\r\nsurrounding rolling plains in a nearly flat, island-like mass. On the\r\nwest, southwest, and south, the Llano Estacado is bounded by the valley\r\nof the Pecos River, while its eastern escarpment is drained by the\r\nheadwaters of the Red, Brazos, and Colorado Rivers.\r\n\r\nThe rim of Palo Duro Canyon is formed by the Eastern Caprock Escarpment.\r\nCaprock is the term used to describe a massive layer of calcareous rock\r\nwhich supports the High Plains surface (_see_ p. 26). Because it is more\r\nresistant to forces of erosion than the softer, underlying more or less\r\nhorizontal strata, the caprock forms an abrupt, precipitous escarpment\r\nat the edge of the High Plains. With the exception of the resistant\r\ncaprock, however, the surficial deposits on the High Plains are for the\r\nmost part unconsolidated sediments.\r\n\r\nThe Llano Estacado is essentially devoid of native trees and is\r\ncharacterized by a sparse, but uniform, covering of grasses. The surface\r\nrocks are of Tertiary and Quaternary age (_see_ geologic time scale,\r\nfig. 6) and have a general easterly to southeasterly slope of about 9½\r\nfeet per mile. In the vicinity of Palo Duro Canyon, rocks of Late\r\nCenozoic age are directly underlain by Permian and Triassic formations.\r\nThese Permian and Triassic rocks, which are discussed elsewhere in this\r\npublication, are not normally exposed except in deeply eroded areas such\r\nas the canyon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 5.

This is not surprising, for most of the\r\nfeatures of the park landscape are composed of or have been sculptured\r\nfrom solid rock. In short, much of the natural beauty of Palo Duro\r\nCanyon has been derived from the character of its exposed rock\r\nformations and the effect of geologic agents upon them.\r\n\r\nBecause rocks are the raw materials of geology and the stuff from which\r\nlandscapes are formed, it will be helpful for the visitor to know\r\nsomething about the general characteristics of rocks and their role in\r\nthe development of the landscape. Rock is everywhere around us and is\r\none of the most common objects in the world, yet few people can actually\r\ndefine a rock. So, at the outset it should be stated that _a rock is a\r\nnaturally formed aggregate of minerals_, and _a mineral is a naturally\r\noccurring substance which has a fairly definite chemical composition,\r\ndistinctive physical properties, characteristic internal structure, and\r\nwhich commonly occurs in definite shapes called crystals_. Although not\r\nan exact scientific or legal definition of a mineral, the above\r\nexplanation is satisfactory for the purposes of this publication.\r\n\r\nAlthough most visitors show considerable interest in the canyon’s rocks\r\nand minerals, few of them know the story behind the rocks. They do not\r\nknow how the rocks were formed, of what they are composed, how they\r\nchange, and how they differ. More important, they fail to realize the\r\nhistorical significance of the rocks and how they can be used to\r\ninterpret events that occurred in the canyon many millions of years ago.\r\nThus, before one studies the geologic story of Palo Duro Canyon, it is\r\nhelpful to know something about the various kinds of rocks. There are\r\nthree major classes of rocks in the earth’s crust: _igneous_,\r\n_sedimentary_, and _metamorphic rocks_.\r\n\r\n_Igneous rocks_ solidified from an original molten state. Common\r\nexamples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and volcanic ash.\r\nAlthough no igneous rocks are found in Palo Duro Canyon, they are widely\r\nexposed in parts of West and Central Texas.\r\n\r\n_Metamorphic rocks_ were originally igneous or sedimentary in origin.\r\nHowever, these rocks have undergone such great physical and chemical\r\nchange that they have been transformed into a different kind of rock.\r\nThus, metamorphic changes alter limestone to marble or sandstone to\r\nquartzite. No metamorphic rocks crop out in the canyon, but, like the\r\nigneous rocks, they are common in some parts of the State.\r\n\r\nAll of the geologic formations exposed in Palo Duro Canyon are composed\r\nof _sedimentary rocks_. These are rocks that have been formed by the\r\ncompaction and cementation of rock and mineral fragments called\r\n_sediments_, or by the precipitation of material from solution.\r\nSandstone, conglomerate, shale, and caliche (_see_ p. 26) are examples\r\nof sedimentary rocks that are exposed in the canyon.\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks are typically _stratified_, that is, they occur in\r\nlayers or beds called _strata_. In addition, sedimentary\r\nrocks—especially those of marine origin—commonly contain _fossils_.\r\nThese fossils are traces or evidence of prehistoric plants and animals\r\nthat have been preserved in the rocks, and they may provide clues as to\r\nthe age of rocks and the manner in which they were formed. Fossil\r\nremains have been found at a number of places in the park and these are\r\ndiscussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        UNRAVELING EARTH HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn order to understand better the geologic history and development of\r\nthe canyon, one should also have some knowledge of the basic principles\r\nof earth history and should be familiar with the geologic time scale\r\n(fig. 6).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6.

It is known, for example, that mountains\r\nnow occupy the sites of ancient seas. Coal is now being mined where\r\nswamps existed many millions of years ago. Furthermore, the earth’s\r\nplants and animals have also been subject to great change. The trend of\r\nthis organic change is, in general, toward more complex and advanced\r\nforms of life. However, some forms have remained virtually unaltered\r\nwhile others have become extinct at different points in geologic time.\r\n\r\nIn order to interpret earth history, the earth scientist gathers\r\nevidence of the great changes in climate, geography, and life that took\r\nplace in the geologic past. He does this by studying the rock\r\nformations, the structural relationships of these formations, and the\r\nlandforms of the area. The record of ancient events is pieced together\r\nby studying the stony layers of the earth as one might study a giant\r\nhistory book. Indeed, the sedimentary rocks are the rocky “pages” of\r\nearth history, for in them we find the tracks and trails, and bones and\r\nstones, which reveal the intriguing story of life long ago.\r\n\r\nMuch of the basic information which the geologist uses to reconstruct\r\nthe geologic history of a region comes from his examination and\r\ninterpretation of _bedrock outcrops_. _Bedrock_ is the solid unweathered\r\nrock which underlies loose earth material such as soil, sand, and\r\ngravel. An _outcrop_, or _exposure_, is a place where bedrock is exposed\r\nat the surface.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter of earth history begins with the most ancient rocks\r\nknown. Because they were formed early in geologic time, these rocks are\r\nnormally found deeply buried beneath younger rocks which have been\r\ndeposited on top of them. It is for this reason that earth history is\r\nread from the bottom up, for the earliest formed rock layers correspond\r\nto the opening chapter in our earthen history book. The later chapters\r\nare found in the upper younger rocks which are located nearer the\r\nsurface. Thus, in “reading” the geologic history of Palo Duro Canyon we\r\nstart with the oldest “chapter” which is recorded in the Quartermaster\r\nFormation (p. 17) of Permian age, for these are the oldest rocks exposed\r\nin the canyon.\r\n\r\nBut deciphering earth history is not as simple as it might appear. In\r\nmany areas the rock layers are not always found in the sequence in which\r\nthey were originally deposited. In places, great structural disturbances\r\nhave caused some of the rocky “pages” to become shuffled and out of\r\nplace; others may be missing completely. Many rocks have been destroyed\r\nby weathering and erosion or greatly altered by metamorphism. As a\r\nresult, the story recorded in these particular rocks is lost forever.\r\nThese missing “pages” make the ancient story even more difficult to\r\ninterpret so the geologist must then depend on other evidence that will\r\npermit him to “fill in the blanks.”\r\n\r\nThe record revealed in the rocks indicates that our planet is at least\r\n4½ billion years old and that life has been present for more than 3\r\nbillion years. During this vast span of time the earth and its\r\ninhabitants have undergone many changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE GEOLOGIC COLUMN AND GEOLOGIC TIME SCALE\r\n\r\nThe _geologic column_ refers to the total succession of rocks, from the\r\noldest to the most recent, that are found in the entire earth or in a\r\ngiven area. For example, the geologic column of Texas includes all rock\r\ndivisions known to be present in the State. By the same token, the\r\ngeologic column of Palo Duro Canyon consists of the geologic formations\r\nexposed there. Thus, by referring to the geologic column previously\r\ndetermined for a specific area, the geologist can determine what type of\r\nrock he might expect to find in that particular region.\r\n\r\nThe _geologic time scale_ (fig. 6) is composed of named intervals of\r\ngeologic time during which were deposited the rocks of the geologic\r\ncolumn. These time intervals bear the same names that are used to\r\ndistinguish the various units of the geologic column. For example, one\r\ncan speak of Permian _time_ (referring to the geologic time scale) or of\r\nPermian _rocks_ (referring to rock units of Permian age in the geologic\r\ncolumn).\r\n\r\nBoth the geologic column and the geologic time scale are based upon the\r\n_principle of superposition_. This basic geologic concept states that\r\nunless a series of sedimentary rock has been overturned, a given rock\r\nlayer is older than the strata above it, and younger than all of the\r\nlayers below it. Thus, the field relationship of the rocks plus the type\r\nof fossils (if present) give the geologist some indication of the\r\n_relative_ age of the rocks. Relative age does not imply age in years;\r\nrather, it fixes age in relation to other events that are recorded in\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years, however, it has become possible to assign ages in\r\nyears to certain rock units. This is accomplished by a system of rock\r\ndating based on very precise measurements of amounts of radioactive\r\nelements (such as uranium). When present in the rocks, radioactive\r\nminerals change or decay at a known rate so that they are natural\r\n“clocks.” This method of dating has made it possible to devise a time\r\nscale in years which gives some idea of the tremendous amount of time\r\nthat has passed since the oldest known rocks were formed. It has also\r\nbeen used to verify the previously determined relative ages of the\r\nvarious rock units.\r\n\r\nThe largest unit of geologic time is an _era_, and each era is divided\r\ninto smaller time units called _periods_. A period of geologic time is\r\ndivided into _epochs_, which, in turn, may be subdivided into still\r\nsmaller units. The geologic time scale might be roughly compared to the\r\ncalendar in which the year is divided into months, months into weeks,\r\nand weeks into days. Unlike years, however, geologic time units are\r\narbitrary and of unequal duration, and the geologist cannot be positive\r\nabout the exact length of time involved in each unit. The time scale\r\ndoes, however, provide a standard by which he can discuss the age of\r\nfossils and their surrounding rocks. By referring to the time scale it\r\nmay be possible, for instance, to state that a certain event occurred\r\nduring the Paleozoic Era in the same sense that one might say that\r\nsomething happened during the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nThere are five eras of geologic time, and each has been given a name\r\nthat is descriptive of the degree of life development that characterizes\r\nthat era. Hence, Paleozoic means “ancient-life” and the era was so named\r\nbecause of the relatively simple and ancient stage of life development.\r\n\r\nThe eras, a guide to their pronunciation, and the literal translation of\r\neach name is shown below.\r\n\r\n    Cenozoic (SEE-no-zo-ic)—“recent-life”\r\n    Mesozoic (MES-o-zo-ic)—“middle-life”\r\n    Paleozoic (PAY-lee-o-zo-ic)—“ancient-life”\r\n    Proterozoic (PRO-ter-o-zo-ic)—“earlier-life”\r\n    Archeozoic (AR-kee-o-zo-ic)—“beginning-life”\r\n\r\nArcheozoic and Proterozoic rocks are commonly grouped together and\r\nreferred to as Precambrian in age. In most places Precambrian rocks have\r\nbeen greatly contorted and metamorphosed, and the record of this portion\r\nof earth history is most difficult to interpret. Precambrian time\r\nrepresents that portion of geologic time from the beginning of earth\r\nhistory until the deposition of the earliest fossiliferous Cambrian\r\nstrata. Precambrian time probably represents as much as 85 percent of\r\nall geologic time.\r\n\r\nThe _oldest_ era is at the _bottom_ of the time scale because this part\r\nof geologic time transpired first and was then followed by the\r\nsuccessively younger eras which are placed above it. This is, of course,\r\nthe order in which the various portions of geologic time occurred and\r\nduring which the corresponding rocks were formed.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, each of the eras has been divided into periods, and\r\nmost of these periods derive their names from the regions in which the\r\nrocks of each were first studied. For example, the Pennsylvanian rocks\r\nof North America were first studied in the State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Generalized geologic map of Palo Duro Canyon\r\n    State Park.]\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION\r\n    Q & T   Pleistocene and Pliocene undifferentiated\r\n    Rdo   Dockum Group\r\n    P   Permian undifferentiated\r\n\r\nThe Paleozoic Era has been divided into seven periods of geologic time.\r\nWith the oldest at the bottom of the list, these periods and the source\r\nof their names are:\r\n\r\n    Permian (PUR-me-un)—from the Province of Perm in Russia\r\n    Pennsylvanian (pen-sil-VAIN-yun)—from the State of Pennsylvania\r\n    Mississippian (miss-i-SIP-i-un)—from the Upper Mississippi Valley\r\n    Devonian (de-VO-ni-un)—from Devonshire, England\r\n    Silurian (si-LOO-ri-un)—for the Silures, an ancient tribe of Britain\r\n    Ordovician (or-doe-VISH-un)—for the Ordovices, an ancient tribe of\r\n          Britain\r\n    Cambrian (KAM-bri-un)—from the Latin word _Cambria_, meaning Wales\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous Period in Europe includes the Mississippian and\r\nPennsylvanian Periods of North America. Although this classification is\r\nno longer used in the United States, the term Carboniferous is found in\r\nmany of the earlier geological publications and on many of the earlier\r\ngeologic maps.\r\n\r\nThe periods of the Mesozoic Era and the source of their names are:\r\n\r\n    Cretaceous (cre-TAY-shus)—from the Latin word _creta_, meaning\r\n          chalky\r\n    Jurassic (joo-RAS-ik)—from the Jura Mountains of Europe\r\n    Triassic (try-ASS-ik)—from the Latin word _triad_, meaning three\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic periods derived their names from an old outdated system of\r\nclassification which divided all of the earth’s rocks into four groups.\r\nThe two divisions listed below are the only names of this system which\r\nare still in use:\r\n\r\n    Quaternary (kwah-TUR-nuh-ri)\r\n    Tertiary (TUR-shi-ri)\r\n\r\nAlthough the units named above are the major divisions of geologic time\r\nand of the geologic column, the geologist generally works with smaller\r\nunits of the column called _geologic formations_. A geologic formation\r\nis a unit of rock that is recognized by certain physical and chemical\r\ncharacteristics. A formation is generally given a double name which\r\nindicates both where it is exposed and the type of rock that makes up\r\nthe bulk of the formation. For example, the Beaumont Clay is a formation\r\nconsisting of clay deposits that are found in and around Beaumont,\r\nTexas. For convenience in study, two or more successive and adjoining\r\nformations may be placed together in a group. Thus, the Tecovas and\r\nTrujillo Formations have been placed in the Dockum Group. Likewise, a\r\nformation may be subdivided into smaller units such as members, which\r\nmay also be given geographic or lithologic (rock type) names.\r\n\r\n\r\n            GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS EXPOSED IN PALO DURO CANYON\r\n\r\nAs noted above, all of the rocks which crop out in Palo Duro Canyon are\r\nsedimentary in origin. They represent four different geological periods:\r\nthe Permian, Triassic, Tertiary, and Quaternary (fig. 12).\r\n\r\nAlthough these rock formations differ considerably in composition and\r\nage, they do not tell the whole geologic story of the area. Long spans\r\nof geologic time are not represented by rock units because the region\r\nwas undergoing erosion or no sediments were being deposited during\r\ncertain portions of geologic time. Rocks that had formed during one\r\ngeologic period were removed by erosion during a later period. Thus,\r\nsegments of the geologic record were destroyed or never recorded. For\r\nthis reason, much of the geologic history of the Palo Duro area is\r\nunrecorded and must be inferred from fragmentary evidence borrowed and\r\npieced together from adjacent areas. Even so, an interesting story can\r\nbe assembled from the rocks that remain in the canyon today.\r\n\r\nIn general, the following descriptions of the formations exposed in Palo\r\nDuro Canyon State Park follow the procedure that most geologists use in\r\npresenting the results of their geologic investigations. The more\r\ndistinctive characteristics of the rock units are described in order\r\nthat they may be more easily recognized, and the ways in which the rocks\r\nwere formed are also considered. With this background it is then\r\npossible to review the geologic history recorded in the bedrock of the\r\ncanyon. A simplified geologic map is presented in figure 7; this shows\r\nthe distribution of the major rock types in the canyon. The reader will\r\nfind it helpful to refer to this map when reading the descriptions of\r\nthe various formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuartermaster Formation.—\r\n\r\nThe oldest formation exposed in the canyon is the Quartermaster\r\nFormation of Permian age (_see_ fig. 6) which is named from exposures\r\nalong the banks of Quartermaster Creek in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma.\r\nOne of the more colorful formations in the park, the Quartermaster is\r\ncomposed primarily of brick-red to vermilion shales which are\r\ninterbedded with lenses of gray shales, clays, mudstones, and\r\nsandstones. Averaging about 60 feet thick where exposed in the park, the\r\nQuartermaster forms the floor and lower walls of the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of this formation are easily examined at many places\r\nthroughout the canyon and in them can be seen a number of interesting\r\ngeologic phenomena. Probably the most noticeable of these features are\r\nthe shining white veins of _gypsum_ that lace the face of the red shale\r\noutcrops (fig. 8). A soft, transparent to translucent mineral that can\r\nbe scratched by a fingernail, gypsum is hydrous calcium sulfate\r\n(CaSO₄·2H₂O). Three varieties of gypsum are found in the canyon: (1)\r\n_satin spar_, a fibrous variety with a silky sheen; (2) _selenite_, a\r\ncolorless, transparent variety which commonly occurs in sheet-like\r\nmasses; and (3) a fine-grained massive variety called _alabaster_. Satin\r\nspar is the most common variety of gypsum present and it commonly occurs\r\nin thin bands interbedded with the mudstones and sandstones. It is much\r\nmore noticeable in the shales, however, for it is typically seen in\r\nnarrow veins which criss-cross the surface of the outcrop and intersect\r\nthe bedding planes at various angles. Although normally white, some of\r\nthe satin spar has a soft pink or bluish hue due to the presence of\r\nimpurities in the mineral.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8. Veins of selenite gypsum (top arrow) in\r\n    Quartermaster Formation. Notice diagonal joint to left of\r\n    geologist’s hand (lower arrow).]\r\n\r\nThe presence of gypsum in the Quartermaster red beds is of special\r\nsignificance to the geologist, for it provides valuable information\r\nabout the geologic history of the Palo Duro area. It is known, for\r\nexample, that when a landlocked body of sea water in an arid climate\r\nbecomes separated from the ocean, one of the most common salts to\r\nprecipitate is hydrous calcium sulfate, or gypsum. Gypsum may also be\r\nprecipitated when a lake without an outlet evaporates in an arid\r\nclimate. Geologic evidence suggests that the sediments which gave rise\r\nto the rocks of the Quartermaster Formation were deposited in a\r\nlandlocked arm of the sea during the latter part of the Permian Period.\r\nAs evaporation continued and the sea water was reduced to approximately\r\none-third of its original volume, gypsum was precipitated. There must\r\nhave been periodic influxes of silt- and mud-bearing waters entering the\r\nancient Permian sea, for layers of shale and mudstone are interbedded\r\nwith the gypsum.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that much of the satin spar and selenite gypsum was\r\noriginally _anhydrite_ (CaSO₄). Unlike gypsum, anhydrite does not\r\ncontain water, but it can be changed to gypsum in the presence of\r\nmoisture. There are two lines of evidence that indicate an anhydrite\r\norigin for the Quartermaster gypsum. First, microscopic examination of\r\ngypsum samples reveals the presence of residual anhydrite crystals\r\nembedded in the gypsum. Second, many of the gypsum beds have been\r\nsqueezed into rather gentle _folds_. These consist of small\r\n_anticlines_, upfolds or arches, and _synclines_, downfolds or troughs\r\n(fig. 9). It has been suggested that this folding took place as the\r\nanhydrite underwent _hydration_, or took on water. As hydration occurred\r\nand the anhydrite was converted to gypsum, the gypsum expanded, thereby\r\nexerting both lateral and vertical pressure on the beds around it. This\r\nproduced the crumpled, wave-like folding so characteristic of certain of\r\nthe gypsum beds. However, there is not complete agreement that the\r\nfolding in the gypsum is due to the hydration of anhydrite. Certain\r\ngeologists attribute this deformation to slumping caused by solution\r\ncavities, for gypsum is relatively easily dissolved in water. As the\r\ngypsum was dissolved and carried away in solution, the removal of the\r\nsupporting layers of gypsum permitted slumping and consequent\r\ndeformation in the overlying shales and mudstones. Although some\r\ngeologists believe that the folds were caused by expansion due to the\r\nhydration of anhydrite and others support deformation related to the\r\nremoval of soluble gypsum, there is general agreement that the folding\r\nis local and not related to regional or widespread deformation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Sagging beds of Quartermaster Formation have\r\n    produced this gentle syncline, or downfolding, in the rocks. The\r\n    “dome” on Capitol Peak can be seen in the background.]\r\n\r\nNot all of the red Quartermaster shales are uniformly colored. Some of\r\nthem contain gray-green, circular spots called _reduction halos_ (fig.\r\n10). These spots, which in places give the red shales a distinctive\r\npolka-dot appearance, have been produced as the result of chemical\r\nchange of certain minerals within the shale.\r\n\r\nAs noted earlier, sediments are usually laid down in horizontal layers.\r\nHowever, in certain environments, sediments may be deposited in such a\r\nway that the layers are inclined at angle to horizontal (fig. 11). This\r\nstructure, called _cross-bedding_ or _cross-stratification_, is found in\r\ncertain sandstones and other coarse-grained or fragmental sedimentary\r\nrocks. Cross-bedding typically consists of rather distinct inclined\r\nlayers separated by _bedding planes_ (the surface of demarcation between\r\ntwo individual rock layers). Bedding of this type commonly occurs in\r\nsedimentary rocks formed in rivers, deltas, and along the margins of\r\nlakes or oceans. The cross-bedding in the Quartermaster and certain of\r\nthe Triassic formations is believed to have been developed under similar\r\nconditions. Although cross-bedding is also common in certain rocks of\r\n_eolian_ origin (deposited by wind) none of the cross-bedding in the\r\ncanyon’s rocks is due to the action of wind.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some of the Quartermaster strata have _ripple marks_ on\r\ntheir surfaces. These features are common in certain sedimentary rocks\r\nand were formed when the surface of a bed of sediment was agitated by\r\nwaves or currents. The size, shape, and cross section of the ripple\r\nmarks can be used to tell whether the marks were produced by waves or\r\ncurrents. The ripple marks in the Quartermaster appear to have been\r\nformed by the action of waves on a shallow sea floor.\r\n\r\nA number of interesting geologic features in the canyon have been formed\r\nin part in the Quartermaster Formation. These include the multi-hued\r\nSpanish Skirts (fig. 26), the Devil’s Slide (fig. 35), Capitol Peak\r\n(fig. 32), and Catarina Cave (fig. 27). The latter is a rather unusual\r\ncave in that it has developed in a large mass of landslide debris\r\ndivided by projecting bedrock of the Spanish Skirts. The cave has been\r\nformed by _suffosian_, a process whereby water enters the landslide\r\ndebris on the upper slopes and follows buried channels in the landslide\r\nremoving rock debris as it passes through. The flood water exits at the\r\nbase of the landslide by means of Catarina Cave. The plan of the cave\r\nclosely resembles the drainage patterns of surface gullies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTecovas Formation.—\r\n\r\nRocks of the Triassic System (fig. 6) are well represented in Palo Duro\r\nCanyon and consist of the _Tecovas_ and _Trujillo_ Formations. These\r\nformations are part of the Dockum Group of Late Triassic age.\r\n\r\nHaving a total thickness of about 200 feet, the Tecovas (which is named\r\nfrom exposures found on Tecovas Creek in Potter County, Texas) consists\r\nlargely of multicolored shales. Also present are thin layers of soft\r\nsandstone, which are disseminated throughout the shales, and a more\r\nprominent bed of white sandstone, which marks the middle of the\r\nformation. The Tecovas shales overlie the Quartermaster Formation, and\r\nthe lower zone of lavender, gray, and white shales forms a relatively\r\nsmooth slope that is easily distinguished from the steeper slopes of\r\ngullied red-and-white-banded shales beneath them (fig. 12).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10. Chemical reactions in certain of the red\r\n    Quartermaster shales have produced reduction halos (p. 19) which\r\n    give the rocks a polka-dot appearance.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11. This boulder, located near the foot of\r\n    Triassic Peak along the Sad Monkey Railroad track, exhibits the\r\n    cross-bedding typical of the Trujillo sandstones.]\r\n\r\nBut the contact zone between the Tecovas and Quartermaster shales\r\ninvolves more than a mere change in color. Here is one of the missing\r\n“chapters” in the geologic history of the canyon, for part of the Late\r\nPermian record and all of the record of Early and Middle Triassic time\r\nare missing from the geologic column. Such gaps in the column are\r\nrepresented by _unconformities_ in the rocks. Here the unconformity is\r\nan ancient erosional surface between the Tecovas Formation of Late\r\nTriassic age and the Late Permian Quartermaster Formation, and there are\r\nmany millions of years of earth history represented in this missing\r\n“chapter” in the geologic story of Palo Duro Canyon. During this vast\r\nspan of time, thousands of feet of sediments were probably deposited,\r\nconverted into rock, and then later removed by erosion.\r\n\r\nNear the middle of the Tecovas Formation there is a bed of white,\r\ncrumbly (friable) sandstone. Averaging about 15 feet in thickness, this\r\nsandstone contains many _joints_ (small crack-like fractures) along\r\nwhich no appreciable movement has taken place (fig. 8). There are two\r\ndistinct sets of these joints which intersect each other at right\r\nangles. The distinctive joint patterns, the color, and the friability of\r\nthis sandstone clearly differentiate it from the harder, darker, and\r\nmore coarse-grained sandstones of the overlying Trujillo Formation (p.\r\n22).\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the Tecovas consists of a layer of orange shale which\r\noverlies the middle sandstone unit and is in contact with the lower part\r\nof the Trujillo Formation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12. Taken from the northwest rim near Coronado\r\n    Lodge, this photograph shows the four major rock units exposed in\r\n    the park: (1) The Quartermaster Formation which forms the lower wall\r\n    and canyon floor; (2) Tecovas Formation; (3) Trujillo Formation\r\n    which caps the mesas; and (4) Ogallala Formation.]\r\n\r\nThe fossils which have been found in the Tecovas Formation suggest that\r\nthese rocks were derived from sediments deposited in swamps and streams.\r\nUnlike the _marine_ deposits of the Quartermaster, the rocks of the\r\nTecovas were formed from _continental_ deposits laid down on the land.\r\nFossils found in the canyon include the bones and teeth of the extinct\r\nsemi-aquatic reptiles known as _phytosaurs_ (fig. 13) and bone and skull\r\nfragments of a primitive amphibian called _Buettneria_ (fig. 14).\r\n_Coprolites_ (the fossilized excrement of animals), pieces of petrified\r\nwood, and the teeth and bones of lungfish have also been reported from\r\nthe Tecovas.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13. The skull of this crocodile-like creature\r\n    called a phytosaur is typical of the reptiles that inhabited the\r\n    Palo Duro area during the Triassic Period. (Photograph courtesy\r\n    Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum.)]\r\n\r\nA number of minerals including _hematite_, an iron mineral, and\r\n_psilomelane_, a barium-magnesium oxide, occur in the Tecovas. Hematite\r\nis an ore of iron and psilomelane a manganese ore, though neither of\r\nthese is present in commercial quantities in the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe Tecovas also contains a number of _concretions_ which range from a\r\nfraction of an inch to as much as 6 inches in diameter. These spherical\r\nmasses are generally harder than the fine-grained shaly sands in which\r\nthey are found and were thus left behind when the surrounding rock was\r\neroded away. Some of these concretions are marked by cracks or veins\r\nfilled with the mineral _calcite_. Concretions bearing this type of\r\nstructure are called _septaria_, or _septarian concretions_.\r\n\r\n_Geodes_ are also found in the Tecovas Formation. These are rounded\r\nconcretionary rocks with a hollow interior that is frequently lined with\r\nmineral crystals. Well-formed crystals of clear calcite have been found\r\nin many of the geodes from the Tecovas.\r\n\r\nAmong park landmarks that are characterized by the multi-hued Tecovas\r\nstrata are the middle portion of Triassic Peak (fig. 25), the upper part\r\nof the Spanish Skirts (fig. 26), Capitol Peak (fig. 32), and the Devil’s\r\nSlide (fig. 35).\r\n\r\n\r\nTrujillo Formation.—\r\n\r\nNamed from rock exposures on Trujillo Creek in Oldham County, Texas, the\r\nTrujillo is easy to distinguish from the underlying Tecovas Formation.\r\nThe contact is quite distinct and lies between the top of the orange\r\nTecovas shale and the base of the massive-bedded, cliff-forming Trujillo\r\nsandstone (fig. 25). Although generally fine grained and thickly bedded,\r\nthere are local concentrations of pebble-sized rock fragments in the\r\nTrujillo. The weathered surface of the lower sandstone is stained red or\r\ndark brown by iron oxides. However, a fresh, unweathered surface is\r\ntypically gray or greenish gray in color, and careful examination of the\r\nunweathered rock reveals the presence of tiny flakes of mica.\r\n\r\nThe basal Trujillo sandstone is one of the most conspicuous rock units\r\nin the canyon and forms many of the prominent benches and mesas so\r\ntypical of the Palo Duro landscape. In places the sandstone is\r\ncross-bedded (p. 20) and contains channel deposits of coarse sand which\r\nsuggest that the sediments from which it was derived were deposited in\r\nancient stream beds.\r\n\r\nRed, maroon, and gray shales overlie the basal sandstone member of the\r\nTrujillo, and these shales are overlain by cross-bedded, coarse-grained\r\nsandstone. Another interval of varicolored shales separates the middle\r\nsandstone bed from the upper sandstone member. The middle sandstone unit\r\nis a conspicuous ledge- or cliff-forming rock and is medium to coarse\r\ngrained and commonly cross-bedded. In most localities, the upper\r\nsandstone is overlain by a section of red and green shales which mark\r\nthe uppermost limits of the Trujillo Formation. In places, however, this\r\nshale section has been removed by erosion and rocks of Tertiary age\r\ndirectly overlie the sandstone.\r\n\r\nAlthough fossils are not common, the remains of _Buettneria_ (fig. 14),\r\nleaf imprints, pieces of mineralized wood, and the scattered teeth and\r\nbone fragments of reptiles and amphibians have been found. Phytosaur\r\nremains, especially teeth, have also been collected from the Trujillo\r\nsandstones.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who formerly inhabited the Palo Duro area (p. 3) put the\r\nrocks of the canyon to a number of uses. This appears to be especially\r\ntrue of the rather coarse-grained Trujillo sandstones, which were\r\ncommonly used for constructing primitive rock shelters. The abrasive\r\nsurface of the sandstone was especially well suited for grinding grain,\r\nand mortar holes have been found in a number of places. One of these\r\n(fig. 15) can be seen along the tracks of the Sad Monkey Railroad (p.\r\n35) near the foot of Triassic Peak. The Indians also used the clays of\r\nthe Quartermaster, Tecovas, and Trujillo Formations to make pottery, and\r\niron and copper minerals such as hematite and malachite were used to\r\nmake red and green pigments for decoration and war paint.\r\n\r\nThe Trujillo shales and sandstones can be seen in a number of Palo\r\nDuro’s more spectacular geological oddities. These erosional remnants\r\nare best developed where blocks of erosion-resistant sandstone protect\r\nunderlying pedestals of softer shale (fig. 15). This type of\r\ndifferential weathering (p. 31) has produced a number of interesting and\r\nunusually shaped pedestal rocks or “hoodoos” (figs. 16 and 20). The most\r\nspectacular erosional remnant—and one that has come to be the\r\n“trademark” of Palo Duro Canyon—is the Lighthouse (fig. 31). The great\r\njumble of boulders called the Rock Garden (fig. 34) is also composed\r\nlargely of massive blocks of dislodged Trujillo sandstone. These\r\nboulders accumulated on the canyon floor as a result of landslides. In\r\naddition, the rock profile known as Santana’s Face (fig. 28) is a\r\nnaturally sculptured profile in the Trujillo sandstone that forms the\r\ncap of Timber Mesa.\r\n\r\n\r\nOgallala Formation.—\r\n\r\nThe Ogallala Formation is named from exposures around Ogallala in Keith\r\nCounty, Nebraska. There is a major unconformity between the Trujillo\r\nFormation of the Triassic and the overlying Ogallala Formation of\r\nPliocene (Late Tertiary) age. Missing here is the geologic evidence for\r\nwhat may have been some of the more exciting chapters in the canyon’s\r\nhistory. There is no record, for example, of the Jurassic and Cretaceous\r\nPeriods which together encompass almost 120 million years of earth\r\nhistory. Also missing is any evidence of what transpired during more\r\nthan 90 percent of the Tertiary Period, for no rocks of Paleocene,\r\nEocene, Oligocene, or Miocene age are exposed in the canyon. Together\r\nthese four epochs comprise approximately 47 million years of earth\r\nhistory. It is impossible, of course, to determine how many geologic\r\nformations may have been formed and later eroded during the 167 million\r\nyears represented by this unconformity. However, our knowledge of\r\npresent-day deposition and erosion suggests that the missing geologic\r\nrecord undoubtedly represents many thousands of feet of rock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14. The skeleton of _Buettneria_, a large\r\n    amphibian, found in Upper Triassic strata in the canyon. (Photograph\r\n    courtesy Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the Ogallala Formation is composed of a\r\nreddish-brown, fine- to medium-grained sandstone that contrasts sharply\r\nwith the underlying red and green shales that are exposed in the top of\r\nthe Trujillo Formation. Much of this sandy rock is characterized by\r\npebbles consisting of a variety of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic\r\nrocks. Because it consists of rock and mineral fragments of varied\r\ncomposition and size, this kind of sedimentary rock is called a\r\n_conglomerate_. The type of rock fragments found in basal Ogallala\r\nconglomerates suggests that they were transported to the\r\nPanhandle-Plains area by streams flowing southeastward from the Rocky\r\nMountains. As these streams deposited their loads, they left behind a\r\nwide spread blanket of sand, gravel, and mud which formed an extensive\r\nalluvial plain that extended from western Nebraska to northwest Texas.\r\nAlthough it is less than 100 feet thick in Palo Duro Canyon, in places\r\nthis great mantle of _fluvial_ (stream-deposited) sediments is as much\r\nas 900 feet thick.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15. The depression in this boulder is a mortar\r\n    hole believed to have been used by the Indians for grinding corn.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16. This pedestal rock, located near the\r\n    Lighthouse, is capped by a slab of weather-resistant Trujillo\r\n    sandstone.]\r\n\r\nMost of the Ogallala Formation consists of a mixture of diverse rock\r\ntypes such as conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, clay and marl. But the\r\nupper part of the formation is characterized by thick _caliche_\r\ndeposits. A dull, earthy calcite deposit, caliche typically forms in\r\nareas of scant rainfall. It is believed to originate when ground\r\nmoisture, containing dissolved calcium bicarbonate, moves to the surface\r\nwhere the moisture steadily evaporates leaving a calcium carbonate crust\r\non or near the surface (fig. 17).\r\n\r\nCaliche, which derives its name from the Latin _calix_, meaning “lime,”\r\nmay be firm and compact or loose and powdery. It is also commonly found\r\nmixed with other materials such as clay, sand, or gravel. Caliche\r\ncommonly occurs in the Trans-Pecos, southwestern Gulf Coastal Plain, and\r\nthe High Plains area of Texas (_see_ fig. 5, p. 8). In the latter area\r\nit typically makes up the “caprock.” Caliche is commonly quarried in\r\nthese parts of Texas where it is used as road material and as an\r\naggregate.\r\n\r\nGood exposures of Ogallala caliche can be seen on the surface around the\r\noverlook at Coronado Lodge on the northwest rim of the canyon (fig. 17).\r\nOgallala strata also crop out along the upper reaches of Park Road 5 as\r\nit starts to descend into the canyon. But probably the most spectacular\r\nexposures of the Ogallala are exposed in the precipitous face of the\r\nFortress Cliff (fig. 33) which forms part of the eastern rim of the\r\ncanyon.\r\n\r\nAlso located within the Ogallala Formation is a very important\r\n_aquifer_—a porous, water-bearing rock formation. This fine-to\r\ncoarse-grained sandstone is very porous and permeable and is the most\r\nimportant single water-producing formation in the Panhandle-Plains area.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 17. The white surface in the right foreground\r\n    consists of caliche (p. 26) in the Ogallala Formation. Coronado\r\n    Lodge can be seen in the right background.]\r\n\r\nOpal and chert are locally abundant in the Ogallala conglomerates. The\r\nopal, which is found in small cavities in the conglomerate is not of the\r\ngem variety but it does _fluoresce_. Minerals that exhibit\r\n_fluorescence_ emit visible colors when exposed to ultraviolet light.\r\nFor this reason, the Ogallala opal is sought after by rock and mineral\r\ncollectors. The chert, a flint-like variety of quartz, occurs as nodules\r\nin the conglomerate and in a well-developed layer near the base of the\r\nformation. Both of these _siliceous_ (silica-bearing) rocks were\r\napparently prized by the Indians, who used them to fashion knives,\r\nscrapers, projectile points, and other artifacts. The Indians also\r\nlearned that flat slabs of caliche were ideal for lining fireplaces and\r\nto construct primitive rock shelters.\r\n\r\nA number of Pliocene vertebrates have been found in the Palo Duro area.\r\nKnown as the “Age of Mammals,” the Tertiary Period was characterized by\r\nmammals as diverse as were the reptiles of the Mesozoic Era. Among these\r\nunusual creatures were such now-extinct species as the saber-tooth cat\r\nand the elephant-like shovel-jawed mastodon (fig. 18). The remains of\r\nthese as well as bones of giraffe-like camels, pony-sized horses, and\r\nsloths have been found in the vicinity of the canyon. The grassy plains\r\nof Pliocene time were also inhabited by large tortoises which reached\r\nlengths of up to 3 feet (fig. 19). Dioramas showing how these animals\r\nmight have looked, as well as their actual remains, are on display in\r\nthe Hall of Pre-History in the lower floor of the Panhandle-Plains\r\nHistorical Museum in Canyon, 13 miles west of the park (p. 35).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18. This life-size model of a shovel-jawed\r\n    mastodon is typical of the now-extinct, elephant-like creatures that\r\n    lived in this area during the Pliocene Epoch. (Photograph courtesy\r\n    Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 19. The carapaces of giant tortoises as much as\r\n    3 feet long have been collected from Pliocene rocks in the Palo Duro\r\n    area. (Photograph courtesy Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks of the Pleistocene.—\r\n\r\nThe youngest rocks in Palo Duro Canyon State Park were formed during the\r\nPleistocene Epoch of the Quaternary Period of the Cenozoic Era (_see_\r\ngeologic time scale, p. 11). Pleistocene rocks are rather widespread in\r\nmuch of the Panhandle-Plains area and they are mostly composed of\r\nsediments which were deposited in stream valleys, in lakes or ponds, or\r\nby the wind. Most of the Pleistocene strata in the park area consist of\r\nloose deposits of silt and sand which were deposited by wind action.\r\nKnown locally as “blow sand,” this reddish-brown, silty sand overlies\r\nthe Ogallala caliche at most points along the canyon’s rim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HOW THE CANYON WAS CARVED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitor seeing Palo Duro Canyon for the first time may find it\r\ndifficult to believe that this yawning chasm began as a simple gully.\r\nBut to the _geomorphologist_—the geologist who studies the origin and\r\ndevelopment of landscapes—Palo Duro Canyon is but a gully magnified many\r\ntimes over. This is evident because the shape of the canyon, the nature\r\nof its tributaries, and the character of its walls indicate that it has\r\nbeen deepened and lengthened by the downcutting of a stream and widened\r\nby other geologic processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE GEOLOGIC WORK OF RUNNING WATER\r\n\r\nPalo Duro Canyon is a classic example of a land-form that has been\r\ncreated by the geologic work of _running water_. Undoubtedly the most\r\nimportant single agent of erosion, running water probably does more to\r\nwear away the land than all the other geologic agents combined. This is\r\nnot surprising considering the fact that the earth’s annual\r\nprecipitation (such as rain and snow) equals about four billion tons of\r\nwater. Although the amount of precipitation varies greatly from place to\r\nplace, the average annual precipitation on land is about 40 inches of\r\nwater. Of this, roughly 25 percent runs off from the land to form\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nWhen one drives through the park and fords the normally gently flowing\r\nwaters of the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River he may well wonder\r\nif this unimposing stream actually is the geologic agent that is\r\nresponsible for this deep gorge. But the visitor who happens to be\r\npresent during a severe rainstorm will soon be convinced, for during\r\nheavy rains this gentle stream becomes a raging torrent. As the river\r\nincreases in size it also becomes a more effective land-shaping tool,\r\nfor the larger and swifter the stream, the more rock material it can\r\ncarry. Thus, when flowing at peak capacity, this branch of the Red River\r\nbecomes a moving ribbon of sandpaper whose load of sand, silt, and\r\ngravel has cut and scoured the canyon walls and floor for hundreds of\r\nthousands of years. How long has it taken the river to carve this\r\nremarkable chasm? Although there is no way of knowing for sure, geologic\r\nevidence indicates that the canyon has formed during the last one\r\nmillion years—a relatively short time, geologically speaking.\r\n\r\nThe work of the river is made still more effective by water and sediment\r\nwhich it receives from its tributaries; this added water substantially\r\nincreases the volume and velocity of the river. Although many of the\r\ntributary streams are dry throughout much of the year, they carry large\r\nquantities of water during heavy rains. Moreover, because most of these\r\nstreams flow over rock surfaces which are not protected by thick soil or\r\nvegetation, their waters are quickly transported to the master stream.\r\nThus, the volume and velocity of the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red\r\nRiver make it possible—especially during flood periods—for the river to\r\ncarry a large load of rock particles which effectively erodes the stream\r\nchannel. Where does this rock debris come from? Most of it is eroded\r\nfrom the sides and bottom of the river’s channel.\r\n\r\nThe river carries its load in a number of ways. Material such as salt\r\nand other soluble matter is transported in a dissolved state or in\r\n_solution_. Still more, for example, silt and fine sand, is carried in\r\n_suspension_. These sediments are suspended between the surface of the\r\nwater and the bottom of the stream channel. Those particles that will\r\nnot dissolve in water and are too heavy to be carried in suspension,\r\nconstitute the _bottom load_ of the stream. These larger sediments, such\r\nas gravel, cobbles, and boulders, roll, bounce, or slide along the\r\nstream bed.\r\n\r\nAs flash floods course through Palo Duro Canyon, the river uses its load\r\nto erode further the rocks over which it passes. Each moving rock\r\nfragment literally becomes a cutting tool for _abrasion_ as the loose\r\nrock particles slowly wear away the banks and bed of the stream.\r\nEventually the abraded rock fragments become smooth and rounded and the\r\nstream channel is gradually worn down to a lower level; it is also\r\nwidened.\r\n\r\nThe river also erodes by _hydraulic action_ as loose rock fragments are\r\nlifted and moved by the force of the stream’s current. This process is\r\nsimilar to the effect produced when soil is churned up and washed away\r\nwhen water from a garden hose is sprayed on loose earth. The effects of\r\nhydraulic action have played an important role in widening the canyon,\r\nfor recession of the cliffs away from the middle of the canyons has been\r\ncaused in part by undercutting. Thus, as the soft shale and gypsum beds\r\nwere removed by the stream, the overlying sandstone formations gradually\r\nbroke off and fell into the canyon. Once on the canyon floor, most of\r\nthe slabs and blocks of sandstone were eventually broken up and carried\r\naway by the streams as sand and mud. Not all of the boulders have been\r\ndestroyed in this manner; in places (for example, the Rock Garden)\r\nsimilar boulders are seen today (fig. 34).\r\n\r\n\r\n               WEATHERING AND GRAVITY ADD THE FINAL TOUCH\r\n\r\nMost of the energy of the river has been expended in downcutting, for\r\nthe canyon has apparently been deepened more rapidly than it has been\r\nwidened. But as the stream gouged its channel deeper into the bedrock,\r\nan ever-increasing expanse of canyon wall was exposed to other agents of\r\nerosion. Slowly—almost imperceptibly—the walls of the canyon have been\r\neroded by the processes of weathering and mass-wasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeathering.—\r\n\r\nWherever rocks are exposed on the earth’s surface, they are attacked by\r\nthe agents of _weathering_. They are dissolved by rainwater, pried apart\r\nby frost and ice, and blasted by windblown sand. Some of the changes\r\nproduced by weathering are purely mechanical, that is, the rock is\r\nsimply reduced to smaller fragments without being broken down chemically\r\nor undergoing any change in its mineral composition. This _mechanical\r\nweathering_, or _disintegration_, takes place in a number of ways.\r\nChanges are especially noticeable in rocks that are subjected to large\r\ndaily temperature variations. If a crack in these rocks becomes filled\r\nwith water and the temperature drops below freezing, ice forms. When\r\nwater freezes it expands by about 10 percent of its volume—this is the\r\nreason why water pipes often split open during the winter. Just as in a\r\nwater pipe, the pressure of the expanding ice is commonly great enough\r\nto widen and deepen the crack in the rock. This process, called _frost\r\nwedging_, may ultimately cause the rock to split and fall apart. The\r\ncumulative effects of frost wedging have probably played a significant\r\nrole in prying off large blocks of rocks from the walls and rim of the\r\ncanyon.\r\n\r\nAnimals and plants may also hasten rock disintegration. Plant roots\r\ncommonly grow in rock crevices and as the roots become larger they wedge\r\nthe rock apart. Burrowing animals such as rabbits, gophers, and ground\r\nsquirrels also promote rock disintegration. Although they do not attack\r\nthe rocks directly, their digging exposes new rock surfaces to\r\nweathering processes. The holes these creatures make also permit water\r\nand air to enter the earth more easily, thereby hastening rock\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nMan, of course, promotes more rock disintegration than all other animals\r\ncombined. Thus, as one explores the canyon’s trails and climbs its\r\nwalls, he will not only see evidence of the various types of mechanical\r\nweathering, he will also be contributing to the further wearing away of\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\n_Decomposition_, or _chemical weathering_, works hand in hand with\r\nmechanical weathering. But unlike disintegration, decomposition produces\r\nrock materials that are basically different from the original\r\nunweathered rock. These changes are brought about as the result of\r\nchemical reactions between minerals in the rocks and water, carbon\r\ndioxide, and oxygen. Although the arid climate and severe winters of the\r\nPanhandle generally facilitate mechanical weathering, some of the red\r\nshales and gypsum deposits show the effect of oxidation, hydration, and\r\nother forms of chemical weathering (fig. 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nMass-wasting.—\r\n\r\n_Mass-wasting_, the erosional process by which rock and soil move\r\ndownslope in response to the force of gravity, has also been\r\ninstrumental in shaping Palo Duro Canyon. This type of erosion has been\r\nespecially active on the walls of the canyon, for here the slopes are\r\nsteep enough to promote downward movement of earth materials. In a few\r\nplaces there have been landslides which have moved large quantities of\r\nrock in a short span of time. But most mass movements have been\r\nimperceptibly slow as masses of _talus_ (accumulations of rock debris)\r\non steeper slopes have inched slowly downhill because of their own\r\nweight. Talus deposits produced in this way can be seen at the foot of\r\nmost of the cliffs and erosional remnants throughout the canyon (fig.\r\n20).\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential erosion.—\r\n\r\nEven the most casual observer will soon note that not all of the\r\ncanyon’s rocks have been equally affected by erosion. Indeed, it is the\r\nnature of this _differential erosion_ that gives Palo Duro Canyon the\r\nrugged sculptured appearance that accounts for much of its beauty.\r\n\r\nVisitors to Palo Duro Canyon commonly ask why the rock formations are so\r\ndiversely shaped. The answer to this question lies in the rocks\r\nthemselves. Because the various rock strata are of unequal hardness,\r\nthey erode at different rates of speed. Hence, the harder, more\r\nresistant rocks, such as the sandstones and conglomerates of the\r\nTrujillo Formation, form the shelves, ledges, and “caps” of the rock\r\nsculptures. The Lighthouse (fig. 31) and other pedestal rocks (fig. 16)\r\nare good examples of land-forms produced by differential erosion. The\r\n“hoodoos” mentioned earlier are also the products of this type of\r\nerosion (figs. 16 and 20).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 20. Talus slopes (arrow) are well developed on\r\n    the east side of Capitol Peak and in places obscure the\r\n    Quartermaster red beds. Note the “hoodoo” at the south (left) end of\r\n    the structure.]\r\n\r\nSofter rocks like shales and clay are more readily eroded and they\r\nnormally form slopes rather than cliffs or ledges (fig. 12). Grooves,\r\nrecesses, and caves have also developed in some of the less resistant\r\nrocks such as the shales and gypsum beds of the Quartermaster Formation.\r\nCatarina Cave (fig. 27) which has formed in the red and white shales of\r\nthe Spanish Skirts (fig. 26) is a good example of this type of feature.\r\nCaves of this type afforded protection to both man and wild animals\r\nsince the dawn of history, for their remains have been found in a number\r\nof similar caves.\r\n\r\nThus, within a relatively short time—geologically speaking—the familiar\r\nland-shaping processes described above have joined forces to provide\r\nTexas with one of its most remarkable natural attractions. But\r\ninterestingly enough, the same geologic processes that created these\r\nunusual formations are busily at work destroying them. As time passes\r\nand erosion progresses, the caps of the pedestals are worn away and the\r\nunderlying shales crumble and are washed into the valley below. Yet even\r\nas the old land-forms are being destroyed, wind, water, ice, and man are\r\nattacking the canyon walls to produce still more of these interesting\r\nerosional remnants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           WHAT TO DO AND SEE AT PALO DURO CANYON STATE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Palo Duro Canyon can choose from a number of recreational\r\nand educational activities. Moreover, regardless of whether one visits\r\nfor a few hours to picnic along the banks of the river, or spends a week\r\nat one of the well-kept campgrounds, the visit will probably be both\r\npleasant and rewarding. In the pages that follow there is a brief\r\ndescription of certain of the park landmarks and some of the more\r\npopular attractions within the canyon. The numbers in parentheses refer\r\nto numbers which designate these places on the map of Palo Duro Canyon\r\n(fig. 2, pp. 4-5). Hopefully, this information will help one to plan his\r\nvisit to the canyon and thereby make his stay more enjoyable and\r\nworthwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Park Entrance_ (1).—\r\n\r\nThe first stop in the park is the gate at the ranger station (fig. 21).\r\nHere one pays a modest admission fee and receives literature and\r\ninformation about the park. The park is open every day of the year, but\r\nthe entrance gates close at sundown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coronado Lodge and Observation Point_ (2).—\r\n\r\nThe overlook at Coronado Lodge (fig. 22), located about half a mile from\r\nthe Park Entrance, is a good place to start one’s visit. Situated on a\r\nledge of Ogallala caliche (p. 26), the Lodge is an attractive, rustic\r\nstructure constructed of blocks of Trujillo sandstone (p. 22). Its\r\npicture windows and outdoor overlook provide a matchless view of the\r\ncanyon and make it possible to become oriented for the descent to the\r\ncanyon floor. Large, coin-operated telescopes permit close-up views of\r\ndistant parts of the canyon, and there are museum cases containing\r\nobjects of historical and geological interest from the Palo Duro area.\r\nIf possible one should visit the Coronado Observation Point more than\r\nonce during the visit, preferably at different times of the day. Because\r\nof shifting clouds and changing lighting conditions, the canyon presents\r\na continually changing panorama from sunrise to sunset. Open year-round,\r\nthe Lodge offers a complete line of souvenirs, film, and camping\r\nsupplies. There is also a snack bar where coffee, sandwiches, and cold\r\ndrinks can be purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scenic Drive_ (1-16).—\r\n\r\nAfter viewing the canyon from Coronado Lodge, one should take the scenic\r\ndrive on Park Road 5. This paved, all-weather road descends the\r\nnorthwest rim of the canyon and continues on to the turnaround at Cow\r\nCamp, a distance of about 8 miles. Although the present scenic drive was\r\ncompleted in 1951, the path that it follows is essentially that which\r\nwas laid out by Colonel Charles Goodnight when he established Palo Duro\r\nranch in 1876. The road descends to the canyon floor in a series of\r\nwell-engineered turns, but because it drops some 800 feet in little more\r\nthan a mile it is wise to use second or low gear on the descent. One\r\nshould also observe the posted speed limits (10 to 20 miles per hour)\r\nand keep to the right side of the road at all times.\r\n\r\nIn the 800-foot drop from rim to floor, the complete geologic section of\r\nthe canyon is traversed, as one passes from the Pleistocene sands\r\nthrough the Ogallala, Trujillo, and Tecovas Formations, before reaching\r\nthe Quartermaster Formation which is exposed in the canyon floor. Each\r\nof these geologic formations is discussed elsewhere in this publication\r\n(pp. 16-28).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pioneer Amphitheatre_ (3).—\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the canyon floor, Park Road 5 flattens out and from this\r\npoint it is but a short distance to the Pioneer Amphitheatre, one of the\r\ncanyon’s newest and most popular attractions. Here, located at the foot\r\nof a colorful 600-foot cliff, is a remarkable 1500-seat outdoor theatre\r\nof latest design (fig. 23). Each evening during a ten-week summer\r\nseason, a symphonic drama portraying the history of the Texas Panhandle\r\nis presented in the amphitheatre. Information about these productions\r\ncan be obtained at the Park Entrance, Coronado Lodge, and other points\r\nwithin the park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 21. The entrance gate to Palo Duro Canyon State\r\n    Park.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 22. Coronado Lodge on the canyon’s northwest rim\r\n    affords panoramic views of the canyon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sad Monkey Train Ride_ (4).—\r\n\r\nThe Sad Monkey Railroad begins—and ends—at Sad Monkey, Texas, a small\r\n“community” that lies at the foot of Triassic Peak (fig. 24). Unlike\r\nmost miniature railroads, the Sad Monkey Special is not a “kiddie” ride.\r\nInstead, this 2-mile journey provides an opportunity to get away from\r\nthe road for a closer look at the geologic formations exposed along the\r\ntrack. There are especially good views of the Spanish Skirts (fig. 26),\r\nCatarina Cave (fig. 27), and Triassic Peak (fig. 25). These, and other\r\nfeatures of geologic interest, are pointed out by an experienced\r\nlecturer who also presents a brief review of the geologic history of the\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Triassic Peak_ (5).—\r\n\r\nLong used by Indians and ranchers as a Palo Duro landmark, the canyon\r\nvisitor will find Triassic Peak to be equally useful as a geologic\r\nlandmark. When viewed from the Sad Monkey Railroad Terminal, the south\r\nface of Triassic Peak clearly reveals three of the four major geologic\r\nformations of the canyon (fig. 25).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 23. Located on the canyon floor, Pioneer\r\n    Amphitheatre is a modern outdoor theatre where symphonic dramas are\r\n    presented each summer. (Courtesy Mrs. Ples Harper, Texas Panhandle\r\n    Heritage Foundation, Inc.; photograph by Ron Horn.)]\r\n\r\nThe lower one-third of the peak consists of deeply furrowed, red and\r\nwhite banded shales of the Quartermaster Formation (p. 17). Overlying\r\nthe Permian red beds are the brightly colored, multi-hued Tecovas shales\r\nof Triassic age (p. 19). The composition of the Tecovas is such that the\r\nlower shales tend to weather into relatively gentle slopes with rather\r\nsmooth surfaces. Triassic Peak is capped by a weather-resistant layer of\r\nTrujillo sandstone, and this durable cliff-forming sandstone has served\r\nas a protective covering to impede the erosion of the softer rocks of\r\nthe Tecovas and Quartermaster Formations. Although it has withstood the\r\nravages of time exceedingly well, the large blocks of Trujillo sandstone\r\nwhich litter the flanks and foot of Triassic Peak clearly indicate that\r\nweathering and mass-wasting have exacted their toll in the geologic\r\npast.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 24. A trip on the Sad Monkey Railroad is a good\r\n    place to learn more about the canyon’s geology and get a closer look\r\n    at the rocks.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 25. Excellent exposures of the Quartermaster\r\n    Formation of Permian age (1) and the Triassic Tecovas (2) and\r\n    Trujillo (3) Formations can be seen in the south face of Triassic\r\n    Peak. The feature known as the Sad Monkey is indicated by the\r\n    arrow.]\r\n\r\nSad Monkey, Texas derives its name from the prominent mass of Trujillo\r\nsandstone at the southern extremity of Triassic Peak. When viewed in the\r\nproper perspective—and with the proper amount of imagination—this\r\nmassive block of sandstone bears a striking resemblance to an aged and\r\nsaddened monkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spanish Skirts_ (6).—\r\n\r\nFew of the canyon’s features are as well-named as the gaudy Spanish\r\nSkirts (fig. 26). The lower part of this multi-colored bluff consists of\r\nalternating layers of red and white Quartermaster shale, capped by the\r\ncolorful maroon and lavender Tecovas shales. Located on the north flank\r\nof Timber Mesa, the Spanish Skirts and nearby Catarina Cave can be\r\nreached by an easy half-mile path. The trail begins on the west side of\r\nPark Road 5, just beyond the Timber Creek bridge located several hundred\r\nfeet from the Sad Monkey Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catarina Cave_ (7).—\r\n\r\nA short distance west of the Spanish Skirts lies Catarina Cave. This\r\ndepression has been washed out of the relatively soluble Permian shales\r\n(fig. 27).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Santana’s Face_ (8).—\r\n\r\nLike Triassic Peak, Timber Mesa is capped by a thick layer of massively\r\nbedded Trujillo sandstone. On the eastern tip of the mesa the sandstone\r\nhas been eroded in such a fashion that it resembles the profile of an\r\nIndian (fig. 28). This feature, called Santana’s Face, is best seen from\r\nthe park road shortly after leaving Sad Monkey Station.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 26. The gaudy Spanish Skirts are a colorful\r\n    expanse of Quartermaster and Tecovas strata exposed on the north\r\n    flank of Timber Mesa. Note the contrast in weathering in the lower,\r\n    gullied Quartermaster Formation and the smooth slopes of the Tecovas\r\n    shales above it. Catarina Cave (arrow) is at the right.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sky Ride_ (9).—\r\n\r\nThe Sky Ride, located near the first water crossing on Park Road 5,\r\ntransports visitors from the canyon floor to the top of Timber Mesa\r\n(fig. 28). The 300-foot ascent is made in ski-lift chairs that are\r\ncomfortable and safe. The observation area atop the mesa offers an\r\nunusually fine view of most parts of the canyon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 27. Catarina Cave (arrow) is easily reached by a\r\n    half-mile trail from Park Road 5.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 28. Santana’s Face (left arrow) has been\r\n    sculptured from the Trujillo sandstone cap of Timber Mesa. The cable\r\n    for the Sky Ride (p. 37) passes through the notch indicated by arrow\r\n    at right.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Water Crossing_ (10).—\r\n\r\nAs it winds through the canyon, the park road crosses the Prairie Dog\r\nTown Fork of the Red River seven times in a distance of about 4 miles.\r\nThese fords, or water crossings as they are called locally, are paved\r\nand are normally safe to pass through. They should, however, be avoided\r\nduring times of heavy rains and flash flooding. Because of stream\r\nerosion, especially fine exposures of the Quartermaster Formation are\r\nrevealed in the stream banks near several of the crossings.\r\n\r\nThe first of these crossings (fig. 29) is about 1 mile from the Sad\r\nMonkey Station and is one of the more popular picnic areas in the park.\r\nThis area was also popular with earlier residents of the park, for it is\r\nbelieved to have been the campgrounds of both the Kiowa and Comanche\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colonel Charles Goodnight’s Dugout_ (11).—\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier (p. 6) Colonel Charles Goodnight entered the canyon\r\nin 1876 with more than 16,000 head of cattle. Although he later\r\nestablished more comfortable quarters, Col. Goodnight first lived in a\r\nprimitive dugout similar to the one shown in figure 30. A replica of\r\nthis early shelter has been constructed of mud, stone, and logs and can\r\nbe seen on the west side of the park road just beyond the first water\r\ncrossing (_see_ fig. 29).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 29. Now a popular picnic spot, the wooded area\r\n    near the first water crossing through the Prairie Dog Town Fork of\r\n    the Red River was a favorite Indian campground.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lighthouse_ (12).—\r\n\r\nThe unpaved road to the Lighthouse enters Park Road 5 about two-tenths\r\nof a mile beyond the first water crossing. Although considered by many\r\nto be the canyon’s best-known landmark, the Lighthouse is actually not\r\nwithin park boundaries. It is located in Little Sunday Canyon about 3\r\nmiles west of the road and is not easily accessible to the average\r\nvisitor. Like many of the park’s natural attractions, the Lighthouse is\r\nan erosional remnant of colorful Trujillo shales and sandstones (fig.\r\n31). A similar pedestal rock, the Devil’s Tombstone, can be reached by\r\nmeans of a trail which leaves the Lighthouse road and enters Sunday\r\nCanyon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 30. When Colonel Charles Goodnight settled in\r\n    the canyon in 1876 he lived in a primitive dugout similar to the one\r\n    shown here.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capitol Peak_ (13).—\r\n\r\nCapitol Peak (figs. 20 and 32) is a rather imposing geologic feature\r\nthat can be seen from a number of points along Park Road 5. There are\r\nespecially good views in the vicinity of the second water crossing if\r\none will look to the west of the road. Just beyond the crossing an\r\nunimproved road leads to the foot of Capitol Peak. The lower part of\r\nthis feature is composed of Quartermaster shales of Permian age and the\r\nupper section consists largely of Triassic Tecovas shales. When viewed\r\nfrom the proper angle, the silhouette of Capitol Peak is thought to\r\nresemble the prostrate form of a human (fig. 32). For this reason it has\r\nalso been called the Sleeping Indian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fortress Cliff_ (14).—\r\n\r\nThe Ogallala Formation of Pliocene age (p. 23) forms the upper rim of\r\nthe canyon and is well exposed in impressive Fortress Cliff (fig. 33).\r\nAlthough this precipitous cliff dominates the eastern rim of the canyon\r\nalong most of the scenic drive, especially good views are afforded\r\nbetween the second and third water crossings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rock Garden_ (15).—\r\n\r\nShortly after fording the river at the fifth water crossing, there is a\r\njumbled pile of boulders on the west side of the road (fig. 34). This\r\naccumulation of Trujillo sandstone blocks has been named the Rock\r\nGarden. Many boulders such as these have accumulated on the floor of the\r\ncanyon in ages past. However, most of these have been destroyed by\r\nweathering and their fragments removed by the canyon’s streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Devil’s Slide_ (16).—\r\n\r\nThe Devil’s Slide can be reached by an unimproved road that leads\r\nsouthwest from the scenic drive for a distance of about half a mile.\r\nComposed of upper Quartermaster and lower Tecovas shales, the surface of\r\nthis eroded spur is laced with many trails and “slides” that have been\r\nmade by previous visitors (fig. 35).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 31. The Lighthouse, an erosional remnant and the\r\n    “trademark” of Palo Duro Canyon, exhibits well the geologic\r\n    phenomenon of differential erosion (p. 31).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Turnaround_ (17).—\r\n\r\nA loop marks the end of Park Road 5 and the conclusion of the scenic\r\ndrive. Located in this area are a number of fine camping areas, picnic\r\ngrounds, the old stone cottages called the “Cow Cabins,” and rest rooms\r\nwith shower facilities (fig. 36).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 32. The “dome” on Capitol Peak is a well-known\r\n    canyon landmark. Composed of the Tecovas and Quartermaster\r\n    Formations, the profile of Capitol Peak is referred to as the\r\n    Sleeping Indian. (The “Indian’s” head can be seen in the right\r\n    background.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 33. Fortress Cliff is a prominent feature on the\r\n    eastern rim of the canyon. Seen here are the precipitous cliffs\r\n    developed in the Ogallala caliche (p. 26) and the sandstones and\r\n    shales of the Trujillo Formation.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 34. The Rock Garden is a jumbled mass of\r\n    Trujillo sandstone boulders that mark the site of an ancient\r\n    landslide.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hiking._—\r\n\r\nThere are a number of established trails for the visitor who is\r\ninterested in hiking. The more popular trails include those to the\r\nSpanish Skirts and Catarina Cave (p. 37), the Devil’s Tombstone, the\r\nLighthouse (p. 39), and the Devil’s Slide (p. 40). Park rangers will be\r\nglad to provide more complete information about these and other trails\r\nwithin the canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horseback riding._—\r\n\r\nSaddle horses can be rented at the stables located east of the road near\r\nthe Pioneer Amphitheatre. There are a number of trail rides that can be\r\ntaken on well-trained horses accustomed to the rugged terrain of the\r\ncanyon. Additional information may be obtained from the attendants at\r\nthe stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Camping and picnicking._—\r\n\r\nAn ample number of well-developed camping and picnic areas are scattered\r\nthroughout the canyon. Most are located adjacent to or a short distance\r\nfrom Park Road 5; they are equipped with outdoor fireplaces and tables.\r\nRunning water, rest rooms, and showers are provided in certain areas.\r\nCampsites are available on a first-come first-served basis, and there is\r\na 10-day limit on overnight camping. Detailed information on camping\r\nregulations and camping areas is available from a park ranger or at the\r\nEntrance Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Photography._—\r\n\r\nPalo Duro Canyon offers many opportunities for both amateur and\r\nprofessional photography. The multi-colored rock formations, erosional\r\nland-forms, and plants and animals offer limitless possibilities to the\r\ncreative and imaginative photographer. Color shots are especially\r\neffective, but a haze filter will be helpful when photographing distant\r\nobjects. Morning and afternoon are the best times for picture taking as\r\nthe mid-day sun is “flat” and lends little perspective to the canyon\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 35. The Devil’s Slide in the south end of the\r\n    park is an eroded spur of Tecovas shales. Some of the “slides” made\r\n    by visitors are indicated by the arrow.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 36. Outcrops of the Quartermaster (1) and\r\n    Tecovas (2) Formations provide a geological backdrop for this\r\n    campsite near the turnaround at the end of Park Road 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PANHANDLE-PLAINS HISTORICAL MUSEUM\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 37. Located on the campus of West Texas State\r\n    University in Canyon, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum has\r\n    many exhibits of historical and geological interest that will\r\n    enhance one’s visit to Palo Duro Canyon State Park. (Courtesy\r\n    Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Palo Duro Canyon State Park would do well to start his\r\nvisit at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum located on the campus of\r\nWest Texas State University in Canyon (fig. 37). Here all phases of\r\nhistory—recent, archeologic, and geologic—are depicted in the various\r\nhalls. In the Hall of Pre-History are the fossilized remains and\r\nreconstructions of ancient animals that were entombed in the canyon\r\nwalls as long as 200 million years ago. Elsewhere there are exhibits and\r\ndioramas that portray human history in the Palo Duro area. Beginning\r\nwith the oldest known evidence of human occupation about 12,000 years\r\nago, there is a succession of displays that tell the story of man in the\r\nPalo Duro—High Plains region. These exhibits follow man from the early\r\nIndians living in stone shelters, to the horse-using nomadic plains\r\nIndians who relied heavily on the great herds of bison and who fought a\r\ndesperate but losing battle to save their homeland from invasion by the\r\nwhite man. Here, too, is the story of the coming of the Spanish\r\nconquistadores, the _comancheros_ (_see_ p. 6), and the advent of the\r\nanglican settler. All are portrayed by means of artifacts that represent\r\nthe different cultures of the region’s colorful past.\r\n\r\nThe major theme of the Museum is the history of the High Plains during\r\nthe period of the cattle industry of the open range. One entire hall is\r\ndevoted to the display of saddles, spurs, lariats, barbed wire, branding\r\nirons, a chuck wagon, and a life size model of a typical cowboy of the\r\nOld West. The Museum also houses one of the nation’s finest collections\r\nof guns of the Old West, the Old World, and guns of today. Other\r\nhighlights include scale models depicting scenes of the Old West,\r\nexhibits of typical rooms from pioneer homes furnished with furniture of\r\nthat era, a fine assortment of antique vehicles, and famous collections\r\nof Western art.\r\n\r\nThe Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum is easily reached from any of the\r\nmajor highways that pass through Canyon. It is open from 9:00 a.m. to\r\n5:00 p.m. weekdays and from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Sundays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SELECTED REFERENCES[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nBrand, J. P.
