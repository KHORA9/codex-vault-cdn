Wraiths have a greater vitality to-day than ever before. They are\r\nfar more numerous than at any time in the past, and people are more\r\ninterested in them. There are persons that claim to be acquainted with\r\nspecific spirits, to speak with them, to carry on correspondence with\r\nthem, and even some who insist that they are private secretaries to the\r\ndead. Others of us mortals, more reserved, are content to keep such\r\ndistance as we may from even the shadow of a shade. But there's no\r\ngetting away from ghosts nowadays, for even if you shut your eyes to\r\nthem in actual life, you stumble over them in the books you read, you\r\nsee them on the stage and on the screen, and you hear them on the\r\nlecture platform. Even a Lodge in any vast wilderness would have the\r\ncompany of spirits. Man's love for the supernatural, which is one of the\r\nmost natural things about him, was never more marked than at present.\r\nYou may go a-ghosting in any company to-day, and all aspects of\r\nliterature, novels, short stories, poetry, and drama alike, reflect the\r\nshadeless spirit. The latest census of the haunting world shows a vast\r\nincrease in population, which might be explained on various grounds.\r\n\r\nLife is so inconveniently complex nowadays, what with income taxes and\r\nother visitations of government, that it is hard for us to have the\r\nadded risk of wraiths, but there's no escaping. Many persons of to-day\r\nare in the same mental state as one Mr. Boggs, told of in a magazine\r\nstory, a rural gentleman who was agitated over spectral visitants. He\r\nhad once talked at a séance with a speaker who claimed to be the spirit\r\nof his brother, Wesley Boggs, but who conversed only on blue suspenders,\r\na subject not of vital interest to Wesley in the flesh. \"Still,\" Mr.\r\nBoggs reflected, \"I'm not so darn sure!\" In answer to a suggestion\r\nregarding subliminal consciousness and dual personality as explanation\r\nof the strange things that come bolting into life, he said, \"It's crawly\r\nany way you look at it. Ghosts inside you are as bad as ghosts outside\r\nyou.\" There are others to-day who are \"not so darn sure!\"\r\n\r\nOne may conjecture divers reasons for this multitude of ghosts in late\r\nliterature. Perhaps spooks are like small boys that rush to fires,\r\nunwilling to miss anything, and craving new sensations. And we mortals\r\nread about them to get vicarious thrills through the safe _medium_ of\r\nfiction. The war made sensationalists of us all, and the drab\r\neverydayness of mortal life bores us. Man's imagination, always bigger\r\nthan his environment, overleaps the barriers of time and space and\r\nclaims all worlds as eminent domain, so that literature, which he has\r\nthe power to create, as he cannot create his material surroundings,\r\npossesses a dramatic intensity, an epic sweep, unknown in actuality. In\r\nthe last analysis, man is as great as his daydreams--or his nightmares!\r\n\r\nGhosts have always haunted literature, and doubtless always will.\r\nSpecters seem never to wear out or to die, but renew their tissue both\r\nof person and of raiment, in marvelous fashion, so that their number\r\nincreases with a Malthusian relentlessness. We of to-day have the ghosts\r\nthat haunted our ancestors, as well as our own modern revenants, and\r\nthere's no earthly use trying to banish or exorcise them by such a\r\nsimple thing as disbelief in them. Schopenhauer asserts that a belief in\r\nghosts is born with man, that it is found in all ages and in all lands,\r\nand that no one is free from it. Since accounts vary, and our earliest\r\nantecedents were poor diarists, it is difficult to establish the\r\napostolic succession of spooks in actual life, but in literature, the\r\nline reaches back as far as the primeval picture writing. A study of\r\nanimism in primitive culture shows many interesting links between the\r\npast and the present in this matter. And anyhow, since man knows that\r\nwhether or not he has seen a ghost, presently he'll be one, he's\r\nfascinated with the subject. And he creates ghosts, not merely in his\r\nown image, but according to his dreams of power.\r\n\r\nThe more man knows of natural laws, the keener he is about the\r\nsupernatural. He may claim to have laid aside superstition, but he isn't\r\nto be believed in that. Though he has discarded witchcraft and alchemy,\r\nit is only that he may have more time for psychical research; true, he\r\nno longer dabbles with ancient magic, but that is because the modern\r\ntypes, as the ouija board, entertain him more. He dearly loves to\r\ntraffic with that other world of which he knows so little and concerning\r\nwhich he is so curious.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the war, or possibly an increase in class consciousness, or\r\nunionization of spirits, or whatever, has greatly energized the ghost in\r\nour day and given him both ambition and strength to do more things than\r\never. Maybe \"pep tablets\" have been discovered on the other side as\r\nwell! No longer is the ghost content to be seen and not heard, to slink\r\naround in shadowy corners as apologetically as poor relations. Wraiths\r\nnow have a rambunctious vitality and self-assurance that are\r\nastonishing. Even the ghosts of folks dead so long they have forgotten\r\nabout themselves are yawning, stretching their skeletons, and starting\r\nout to do a little haunting. Spooky creatures in such a wide diversity\r\nare abroad to-day that one is sometimes at a loss to know what to do\r\n\"gin a body meet a body.\" Ghosts are entering all sorts of activities\r\nnow, so that mortals had better look alive, else they'll be crowded out\r\nof their place in the shade. The dead are too much with us!\r\n\r\nModern ghosts are less simple and primitive than their ancestors, and\r\nare developing complexes of various kinds. They are more democratic than\r\nof old, and have more of a diversity of interests, so that mortals have\r\nscarcely the ghost of a chance with them. They employ all the agencies\r\nand mechanisms known to mortals, and have in addition their own methods\r\nof transit and communication. Whereas in the past a ghost had to stalk\r\nor glide to his haunts, now he limousines or airplanes, so that\r\nnaturally he can get in more work than before. He uses the wireless to\r\nsend his messages, and is expert in all manner of scientific lines.\r\n\r\nIn fact, his infernal efficiency and knowledge of science constitute the\r\nworst terror of the current specter. Who can combat a ghost that knows\r\nall about a chemical laboratory, that can add electricity to his other\r\nshocks, and can employ all mortal and immortal agencies as his own?\r\nScience itself is supernatural, as we see when we look at it properly.\r\n\r\nModern literature, especially the most recent, shows a revival of old\r\ntypes of ghosts, together with the innovations of the new. There are\r\nspecters that take a real part in the plot complication, and those that\r\nmerely cast threatening looks at the living, or at least, are content to\r\nspeak a piece and depart. Some spirits are dumb, while others are highly\r\nelocutionary.\r\n\r\nGhosts vary in many respects. Some are like the pallid shades of the\r\npast, altogether unlike the living and with an unmistakable spectral\r\nform--or lack of it. They sweep like mist through the air, or flutter\r\nlike dead leaves in the gale--a gale always accompanying them as part of\r\nthe stock furnishings. On the other hand, some revenants are so\r\nsuccessfully made up that one doesn't believe them when they pridefully\r\nannounce that they are wraiths. Some of them are, in fact, so alive that\r\nthey don't themselves know they're dead. It's going to be a great shock\r\nto some of them one of these days to wake up and find out they're\r\ndemised!\r\n\r\nGhosts are more gregarious than in the past. Formerly a shade slunk off\r\nby himself, as if ashamed of his profession, as if aware of the lack of\r\ncordiality with which he would be received, knowing that mortals shunned\r\nand feared him, and chary even of associating with his fellow-shades. He\r\nwraithed all by himself. The specters of the past--save in scenes of the\r\nlower world,--were usually solitary creatures, driven to haunt mortals\r\nfrom very lonesomeness. Now we have a chance to study the mob psychology\r\nof ghosts, for they come in madding crowds whenever they like.\r\n\r\nGhosts at present are showing an active interest not only in public\r\naffairs, but in the arts as well. At least, we now have pictures and\r\nwriting attributed to them. Perhaps annoyed by some of the inaccuracies\r\npublished concerning them--for authors have in the past taken advantage\r\nof the belief that ghosts couldn't write back--they have recently\r\ndeveloped itching pens. They use all manner of utensils for expression\r\nnow. There's the magic typewriter that spooks for John Kendrick Bangs,\r\nthe boardwalk that Patience Worth executes for Mrs. Curran, and\r\ninnumerable other specters that commandeer fountain pens and pencils and\r\nbrushes to give their versions of infinity. There's a passion on the\r\npart of ghosts for being interviewed just now. At present\r\nbook-reviewers, for instance, had better be careful, lest the wraiths\r\ntake their own method of answering criticism. It isn't safe to speak or\r\nwrite with anything but respect of ghosts now. _De mortuis nil nisi\r\nbonum_, indeed! One should never make light of a shade.\r\n\r\nModern ghosts have a more pronounced personality than the specters of\r\nthe past. They have more strength, of mind as well as of body, than the\r\ncolorless revenants of earlier literature, and they produce a more vivid\r\neffect on the beholder and the reader. They know more surely what they\r\nwish to do, and they advance relentlessly and with economy of effort to\r\nthe effecting of their purpose, whether it be of pure horror, of beauty,\r\nor pathos of humor. We have now many spirits in fiction that are\r\npathetic without frightfulness, many that move us with a sense of poetic\r\nbeauty rather than of curdling horror, who touch the heart as well as\r\nthe spine of the reader. And the humorous ghost is a distinctive shade\r\nof to-day, with his quips and pranks and haunting grin. Whatever a\r\nmodern ghost wishes to do or to be, he is or does, with confidence and\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of to-day is terrifyingly visible or invisible at will. The\r\ndreadful presence of a ghost that one cannot see is more unbearable than\r\nthe specter that one can locate and attempt to escape from. The\r\ninvisible haunting is represented in this volume by Fitz-James O'Brien's\r\n_What Was It?_ one of the very best of the type, and one that has\r\nstrongly influenced others. O'Brien's story preceded Guy de Maupassant's\r\n_Le Horla_ by several years, and must surely have suggested to\r\nMaupassant as to Bierce, in his _The Damned Thing_, the power of evil\r\nthat can be felt but not seen.\r\n\r\nThe wraith of the present carries with him more vital energy than his\r\npredecessors, is more athletic in his struggles with the unlucky wights\r\nhe visits, and can coerce mortals to do his will by the laying on of\r\nhands as well as by the look or word. He speaks with more emphasis and\r\nauthority, as well as with more human naturalness, than the earlier\r\nghosts. He has not only all the force he possessed in life, but in many\r\ninstances has an access of power, which makes man a poor protagonist for\r\nhim. Algernon Blackwood's spirits of evil, for example, have a more\r\nawful potentiality than any living person could have, and their will to\r\nharm has been increased immeasurably by the accident of death. If the\r\nfacts bear out the fear that such is the case in life as in fiction,\r\nsome of our social customs will be reversed. A man will strive by all\r\nmeans to keep his deadly enemy alive, lest death may endow him with\r\ntenfold power to hurt. Dark discarnate passions, disembodied hates, work\r\nevil where a simple ghost might be helpless and abashed. Algernon\r\nBlackwood has command over the spirits of air and fire and wave, so that\r\nhis pages thrill with beauty and terror. He has handled almost all known\r\naspects of the supernatural, and from his many stories he has selected\r\nfor this volume _The Willows_ as the best example of his ghostly art.\r\n\r\nApparitions are more readily recognizable at present than in the past,\r\nfor they carry into eternity all the disfigurements or physical\r\npeculiarities that the living bodies possessed--a fact discouraging to\r\nall persons not conspicuous for good looks. Freckles and warts, long\r\nnoses and missing limbs distinguish the ghosts and aid in crucial\r\nidentification. The thrill of horror in Ambrose Bierce's story, _The\r\nMiddle Toe of the Right Foot_, is intensified by the fact that the dead\r\nwoman who comes back in revenge to haunt her murderer, has one toe\r\nlacking as in life. And in a recent story a surgeon whose desire to\r\nexperiment has caused him needlessly to sacrifice a man's life on the\r\noperating table, is haunted to death by the dismembered arm. Fiction\r\nshows us various ghosts with half faces, and at least one notable spook\r\nthat comes in half. Such ability, it will be granted, must necessarily\r\nincrease the haunting power, for if a ghost may send a foot or an arm or\r\na leg to harry one person, he can dispatch his back-bone or his liver or\r\nhis heart to upset other human beings simultaneously in a sectional\r\nhaunting at once economically efficient and terrifying.\r\n\r\n_The Beast with Five Fingers_, for instance, has a loathsome horror that\r\na complete skeleton or conventionally equipped wraith could not achieve.\r\nWho can doubt that a bodiless hand leaping around on its errands of evil\r\nhas a menace that a complete six-foot frame could not duplicate? Yet, in\r\nQuiller-Couch's _A Pair of Hands_, what pathos and beauty in the thought\r\nof the child hands coming back to serve others in homely tasks! Surely\r\nno housewife in these helpless days would object to being haunted in\r\nsuch delicate fashion.\r\n\r\nGhosts of to-day have an originality that antique specters lacked. For\r\ninstance, what story of the past has the awful thrill in Andreyev's\r\n_Lazarus_, that story of the man who came back from the grave, living,\r\nyet dead, with the horror of the unknown so manifest in his face that\r\nthose who looked into his deep eyes met their doom? Present-day writers\r\nskillfully combine various elements of awe with the supernatural, as\r\nmadness with the ghostly, adding to the chill of fear which each concept\r\ngives. Wilbur Daniel Steele's _The Woman at Seven Brothers_ is an\r\ninstance of that method.\r\n\r\nPoe's _Ligeia_, one of the best stories in any language, reveals the\r\nunrelenting will of the dead to effect its desire,--the dead wife\r\ntriumphantly coming back to life through the second wife's body. Olivia\r\nHoward Dunbar's _The Shell of Sense_ is another instance of jealousy\r\nreaching beyond the grave. _The Messenger_, one of Robert W. Chambers's\r\nearly stories and an admirable example of the supernatural, has various\r\nthrills, with its river of blood, its death's head moth, and the ancient\r\nbut very active skull of the Black Priest who was shot as a traitor to\r\nhis country, but lived on as an energetic and curseful ghost.\r\n\r\n_The Shadows on the Wall_, by Mary E. Wilkins Freeman,--which one\r\nprominent librarian considers the best ghost story ever written,--is\r\noriginal in the method of its horrific manifestation. Isn't it more\r\ndevastating to one's sanity to see the shadow of a revenge ghost cast on\r\nthe wall,--to know that a vindictive spirit is beside one but\r\ninvisible--than to see the specter himself? Under such circumstances,\r\nthe sight of a skeleton or a sheeted phantom would be downright\r\ncomforting.\r\n\r\n_The Mass of Shadows_, by Anatole France, is an example of the modern\r\ntendency to show phantoms in groups, as contrasted with the solitary\r\nhabits of ancient specters. Here the spirits of those who had sinned for\r\nlove could meet and celebrate mass together in one evening of the year.\r\n\r\nThe delicate beauty of many of the modern ghostly stories is apparent in\r\n_The Haunted Orchard_, by Richard Le Gallienne, for this prose poem has\r\nan appeal of tenderness rather than of terror. And everybody who has\r\nhad affection for a dog will appreciate the pathos of the little sketch,\r\nby Myla J. Closser, _At the Gate_. The dog appears more frequently as a\r\nghost than does any other animal, perhaps because man feels that he is\r\nnearer the human,--though the horse is as intelligent and as much\r\nbeloved. There is an innate pathos about a dog somehow, that makes his\r\nappearance in ghostly form more credible and sympathetic, while the\r\nghost of any other animal would tend to have a comic connotation. Other\r\nanimals in fiction have power of magic--notably the cat--but they don't\r\nappear as spirits. But the dog is seen as a pathetic symbol of\r\nfaithfulness, as a tragic sufferer, or as a terrible revenge ghost. Dogs\r\nmay come singly or in groups--Edith Wharton has five of different sorts\r\nin _Kerfol_--or in packs, as in Eden Phillpotts's _Another Little Heath\r\nHound_.\r\n\r\nAn illuminating instance of the power of fiction over human faith is\r\nfurnished by the case of Arthur Machen's _The Bowmen_, included here.\r\nThis story it is which started the whole tissue of legendry concerning\r\nsupernatural aid given the allied armies during the war. This purely\r\nfictitious account of an angel army that saved the day at Mons was so\r\nvivid that its readers accepted it as truth and obstinately clung to\r\nthat idea in the face of Mr. Machen's persistent and bewildered\r\nexplanations that he had invented the whole thing. Editors wrote leading\r\narticles about it, ministers preached sermons on it, and the general\r\npublic preferred to believe in the Mons angels rather than in Arthur\r\nMachen. Mr. Machen has shown himself an artist in the supernatural, one\r\nwhom his generation has not been discerning enough to appreciate. Some\r\nof his material is painfully morbid, but his pen is magic and his\r\ninkwell holds many dark secrets.\r\n\r\nIn this collection I have attempted to include specimens of a few of the\r\ndistinctive types of modern ghosts, as well as to show the art of\r\nindividual stories. Examples of the humorous ghosts are omitted here, as\r\na number of them will be brought together in _Humorous Ghost Stories_,\r\nthe companion volume to this. The ghost lover who reads these pages will\r\nthink of others that he would like to see included--for I believe that\r\nreaders are more passionately attached to their own favorite ghost tales\r\nthan to any other form of literature. But critics will admit the\r\nmanifest impossibility of bringing together in one volume all the famous\r\nexamples of the art. Some of the well-known tales, particularly the\r\nolder ones on which copyright has expired, have been reprinted so often\r\nas to be almost hackneyed, while others have been of necessity omitted\r\nbecause of the limitations of space.\r\n\r\n                                                                    D.S.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK,\r\n  March, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION: THE IMPERISHABLE GHOST\r\n\r\nTHE WILLOWS\r\n    BY ALGERNON BLACKWOOD\r\n\r\nTHE SHADOWS ON THE WALL\r\n    BY MARY E.

Published in America by\r\n     E.P. Dutton, and in England by Everleigh Nash, Ltd. By permission\r\n     of the publishers and Algernon Blackwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Vienna, and long before you come to Buda-Pesth, the Danube\r\nenters a region of singular loneliness and desolation, where its waters\r\nspread away on all sides regardless of a main channel, and the country\r\nbecomes a swamp for miles upon miles, covered by a vast sea of low\r\nwillow-bushes. On the big maps this deserted area is painted in a fluffy\r\nblue, growing fainter in color as it leaves the banks, and across it may\r\nbe seen in large straggling letters the word _Sümpfe_, meaning marshes.\r\n\r\nIn high flood this great acreage of sand, shingle-beds, and willow-grown\r\nislands is almost topped by the water, but in normal seasons the bushes\r\nbend and rustle in the free winds, showing their silver leaves to the\r\nsunshine in an ever-moving plain of bewildering beauty. These willows\r\nnever attain to the dignity of trees; they have no rigid trunks; they\r\nremain humble bushes, with rounded tops and soft outline, swaying on\r\nslender stems that answer to the least pressure of the wind; supple as\r\ngrasses, and so continually shifting that they somehow give the\r\nimpression that the entire plain is moving and _alive_. For the wind\r\nsends waves rising and falling over the whole surface, waves of leaves\r\ninstead of waves of water, green swells like the sea, too, until the\r\nbranches turn and lift, and then silvery white as their under-side turns\r\nto the sun.\r\n\r\nHappy to slip beyond the control of stern banks, the Danube here wanders\r\nabout at will among the intricate network of channels intersecting the\r\nislands everywhere with broad avenues down which the waters pour with a\r\nshouting sound; making whirlpools, eddies, and foaming rapids; tearing\r\nat the sandy banks; carrying away masses of shore and willow-clumps; and\r\nforming new islands innumerable which shift daily in size and shape and\r\npossess at best an impermanent life, since the flood-time obliterates\r\ntheir very existence.\r\n\r\nProperly speaking, this fascinating part of the river's life begins soon\r\nafter leaving Pressburg, and we, in our Canadian canoe, with gipsy tent\r\nand frying-pan on board, reached it on the crest of a rising flood about\r\nmid-July. That very same morning, when the sky was reddening before\r\nsunrise, we had slipped swiftly through still-sleeping Vienna, leaving\r\nit a couple of hours later a mere patch of smoke against the blue hills\r\nof the Wienerwald on the horizon; we had breakfasted below Fischeramend\r\nunder a grove of birch trees roaring in the wind; and had then swept on\r\nthe tearing current past Orth, Hainburg, Petronell (the old Roman\r\nCarnuntum of Marcus Aurelius), and so under the frowning heights of\r\nTheben on a spur of the Carpathians, where the March steals in quietly\r\nfrom the left and the frontier is crossed between Austria and Hungary.\r\n\r\nRacing along at twelve kilometers an hour soon took us well into\r\nHungary, and the muddy waters--sure sign of flood--sent us aground on\r\nmany a shingle-bed, and twisted us like a cork in many a sudden belching\r\nwhirlpool before the towers of Pressburg (Hungarian, Poszóny) showed\r\nagainst the sky; and then the canoe, leaping like a spirited horse, flew\r\nat top speed under the gray walls, negotiated safely the sunken chain of\r\nthe Fliegende Brücke ferry, turned the corner sharply to the left, and\r\nplunged on yellow foam into the wilderness of islands, sand-banks, and\r\nswamp-land beyond--the land of the willows.\r\n\r\nThe change came suddenly, as when a series of bioscope pictures snaps\r\ndown on the streets of a town and shifts without warning into the\r\nscenery of lake and forest. We entered the land of desolation on wings,\r\nand in less than half an hour there was neither boat nor fishing-hut nor\r\nred roof, nor any single sign of human habitation and civilization\r\nwithin sight. The sense of remoteness from the world of human kind, the\r\nutter isolation, the fascination of this singular world of willows,\r\nwinds, and waters, instantly laid its spell upon us both, so that we\r\nallowed laughingly to one another that we ought by rights to have held\r\nsome special kind of passport to admit us, and that we had, somewhat\r\naudaciously, come without asking leave into a separate little kingdom of\r\nwonder and magic--a kingdom that was reserved for the use of others who\r\nhad a right to it, with everywhere unwritten warnings to trespassers for\r\nthose who had the imagination to discover them.\r\n\r\nThough still early in the afternoon, the ceaseless buffetings of a most\r\ntempestuous wind made us feel weary, and we at once began casting about\r\nfor a suitable camping-ground for the night. But the bewildering\r\ncharacter of the islands made landing difficult; the swirling flood\r\ncarried us in-shore and then swept us out again; the willow branches\r\ntore our hands as we seized them to stop the canoe, and we pulled many a\r\nyard of sandy bank into the water before at length we shot with a great\r\nsideways blow from the wind into a backwater and managed to beach the\r\nbows in a cloud of spray. Then we lay panting and laughing after our\r\nexertions on hot yellow sand, sheltered from the wind, and in the full\r\nblaze of a scorching sun, a cloudless blue sky above, and an immense\r\narmy of dancing, shouting willow bushes, closing in from all sides,\r\nshining with spray and clapping their thousand little hands as though to\r\napplaud the success of our efforts.\r\n\r\n\"What a river!\" I said to my companion, thinking of all the way we had\r\ntraveled from the source in the Black Forest, and how we had often been\r\nobliged to wade and push in the upper shallows at the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n\"Won't stand much nonsense now, will it?\" he said, pulling the canoe a\r\nlittle farther into safety up the sand, and then composing himself for a\r\nnap.\r\n\r\nI lay by his side, happy and peaceful in the bath of the\r\nelements--water, wind, sand, and the great fire of the sun--thinking of\r\nthe long journey that lay behind us, and of the great stretch before us\r\nto the Black Sea, and how lucky I was to have such a delightful and\r\ncharming traveling companion as my friend, the Swede.\r\n\r\nWe had made many similar journeys together, but the Danube, more than\r\nany other river I knew, impressed us from the very beginning with its\r\n_aliveness_. From its tiny bubbling entry into the world among the\r\npinewood gardens of Donaueschingen, until this moment when it began to\r\nplay the great river-game of losing itself among the deserted swamps,\r\nunobserved, unrestrained, it had seemed to us like following the growth\r\nof some living creature. Sleepy at first, but later developing violent\r\ndesires as it became conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some\r\nhuge fluid being, through all the countries we had passed, holding our\r\nlittle craft on its mighty shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes,\r\nyet always friendly and well-meaning, till at length we had come\r\ninevitably to regard it as a Great Personage.\r\n\r\nHow, indeed, could it be otherwise, since it told us so much of its\r\nsecret life? At night we heard it singing to the moon as we lay in our\r\ntent, uttering that odd sibilant note peculiar to itself and said to be\r\ncaused by the rapid tearing of the pebbles along its bed, so great is\r\nits hurrying speed. We knew, too, the voice of its gurgling whirlpools,\r\nsuddenly bubbling up on a surface previously quite calm; the roar of its\r\nshallows and swift rapids; its constant steady thundering below all mere\r\nsurface sounds; and that ceaseless tearing of its icy waters at the\r\nbanks. How it stood up and shouted when the rains fell flat upon its\r\nface! And how its laughter roared out when the wind blew upstream and\r\ntried to stop its growing speed! We knew all its sounds and voices, its\r\ntumblings and foamings, its unnecessary splashing against the bridges;\r\nthat self-conscious chatter when there were hills to look on; the\r\naffected dignity of its speech when it passed through the little towns,\r\nfar too important to laugh; and all these faint, sweet whisperings when\r\nthe sun caught it fairly in some slow curve and poured down upon it till\r\nthe steam rose.\r\n\r\nIt was full of tricks, too, in its early life before the great world\r\nknew it. There were places in the upper reaches among the Swabian\r\nforests, when yet the first whispers of its destiny had not reached it,\r\nwhere it elected to disappear through holes in the ground, to appear\r\nagain on the other side of the porous limestone hills and start a new\r\nriver with another name; leaving, too, so little water in its own bed\r\nthat we had to climb out and wade and push the canoe through miles of\r\nshallows!\r\n\r\nAnd a chief pleasure, in those early days of its irresponsible youth,\r\nwas to lie low, like Brer Fox, just before the little turbulent\r\ntributaries came to join it from the Alps, and to refuse to acknowledge\r\nthem when in, but to run for miles side by side, the dividing line well\r\nmarked, the very levels different, the Danube utterly declining to\r\nrecognize the new-comer. Below Passau, however, it gave up this\r\nparticular trick, for there the Inn comes in with a thundering power\r\nimpossible to ignore, and so pushes and incommodes the parent river that\r\nthere is hardly room for them in the long twisting gorge that follows,\r\nand the Danube is shoved this way and that against the cliffs, and\r\nforced to hurry itself with great waves and much dashing to and fro in\r\norder to get through in time. And during the fight our canoe slipped\r\ndown from its shoulder to its breast, and had the time of its life among\r\nthe struggling waves. But the Inn taught the old river a lesson, and\r\nafter Passau it no longer pretended to ignore new arrivals.\r\n\r\nThis was many days back, of course, and since then we had come to know\r\nother aspects of the great creature, and across the Bavarian wheat plain\r\nof Straubing she wandered so slowly under the blazing June sun that we\r\ncould well imagine only the surface inches were water, while below there\r\nmoved, concealed as by a silken mantle, a whole army of Undines,\r\npassing silently and unseen down to the sea, and very leisurely too,\r\nlest they be discovered.\r\n\r\nMuch, too, we forgave her because of her friendliness to the birds and\r\nanimals that haunted the shores. Cormorants lined the banks in lonely\r\nplaces in rows like short black palings; gray crows crowded the\r\nshingle-beds; storks stood fishing in the vistas of shallower water that\r\nopened up between the islands, and hawks, swans, and marsh birds of all\r\nsorts filled the air with glinting wings and singing, petulant cries. It\r\nwas impossible to feel annoyed with the river's vagaries after seeing a\r\ndeer leap with a splash into the water at sunrise and swim past the bows\r\nof the canoe; and often we saw fawns peering at us from the underbrush,\r\nor looked straight into the brown eyes of a stag as we charged full tilt\r\nround a corner and entered another reach of the river. Foxes, too,\r\neverywhere haunted the banks, tripping daintily among the driftwood and\r\ndisappearing so suddenly that it was impossible to see how they managed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut now, after leaving Pressburg, everything changed a little, and the\r\nDanube became more serious. It ceased trifling. It was halfway to the\r\nBlack Sea, within scenting distance almost of other, stranger countries\r\nwhere no tricks would be permitted or understood. It became suddenly\r\ngrown-up, and claimed our respect and even our awe. It broke out into\r\nthree arms, for one thing, that only met again a hundred kilometers\r\nfarther down, and for a canoe there were no indications which one was\r\nintended to be followed.\r\n\r\n\"If you take a side channel,\" said the Hungarian officer we met in the\r\nPressburg shop while buying provisions, \"you may find yourselves, when\r\nthe flood subsides, forty miles from anywhere, high and dry, and you may\r\neasily starve. There are no people, no farms, no fishermen. I warn you\r\nnot to continue. The river, too, is still rising, and this wind will\r\nincrease.\"\r\n\r\nThe rising river did not alarm us in the least, but the matter of being\r\nleft high and dry by a sudden subsidence of the waters might be serious,\r\nand we had consequently laid in an extra stock of provisions. For the\r\nrest, the officer's prophecy held true, and the wind, blowing down a\r\nperfectly clear sky, increased steadily till it reached the dignity of a\r\nwesterly gale.\r\n\r\nIt was earlier than usual when we camped, for the sun was a good hour or\r\ntwo from the horizon, and leaving my friend still asleep on the hot\r\nsand, I wandered about in desultory examination of our hotel. The\r\nisland, I found, was less than an acre in extent, a mere sandy bank\r\nstanding some two or three feet above the level of the river. The far\r\nend, pointing into the sunset, was covered with flying spray which the\r\ntremendous wind drove off the crests of the broken waves. It was\r\ntriangular in shape, with the apex upstream.\r\n\r\nI stood there for several minutes, watching the impetuous crimson flood\r\nbearing down with a shouting roar, dashing in waves against the bank as\r\nthough to sweep it bodily away, and then swirling by in two foaming\r\nstreams on either side. The ground seemed to shake with the shock and\r\nrush while the furious movement of the willow bushes as the wind poured\r\nover them increased the curious illusion that the island itself actually\r\nmoved. Above, for a mile or two, I could see the great river descending\r\nupon me: it was like looking up the slope of a sliding hill, white with\r\nfoam, and leaping up everywhere to show itself to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the island was too thickly grown with willows to make\r\nwalking pleasant, but I made the tour, nevertheless. From the lower end\r\nthe light, of course, changed, and the river looked dark and angry. Only\r\nthe backs of the flying waves were visible, streaked with foam, and\r\npushed forcibly by the great puffs of wind that fell upon them from\r\nbehind. For a short mile it was visible, pouring in and out among the\r\nislands, and then disappearing with a huge sweep into the willows, which\r\nclosed about it like a herd of monstrous antediluvian creatures crowding\r\ndown to drink. They made me think of gigantic sponge-like growths that\r\nsucked the river up into themselves. They caused it to vanish from\r\nsight. They herded there together in such overpowering numbers.\r\n\r\nAltogether it was an impressive scene, with its utter loneliness, its\r\nbizarre suggestion; and as I gazed, long and curiously, a singular\r\nemotion began stir somewhere in the depths of me. Midway in my delight\r\nof the wild beauty, there crept unbidden and unexplained, a curious\r\nfeeling of disquietude, almost of alarm.\r\n\r\nA rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the ominous: many\r\nof the little islands I saw before me would probably have been swept\r\naway by the morning; this resistless, thundering flood of water touched\r\nthe sense of awe. Yet I was aware that my uneasiness lay deeper far than\r\nthe emotions of awe and wonder. It was not that I felt. Nor had it\r\ndirectly to do with the power of the driving wind--this shouting\r\nhurricane that might almost carry up a few acres of willows into the air\r\nand scatter them like so much chaff over the landscape. The wind was\r\nsimply enjoying itself, for nothing rose out of the flat landscape to\r\nstop it, and I was conscious of sharing its great game with a kind of\r\npleasurable excitement. Yet this novel emotion had nothing to do with\r\nthe wind. Indeed, so vague was the sense of distress I experienced, that\r\nit was impossible to trace it to its source and deal with it\r\naccordingly, though I was aware somehow that it had to do with my\r\nrealization of our utter insignificance before this unrestrained power\r\nof the elements about me. The huge-grown river had something to do with\r\nit too--a vague, unpleasant idea that we had somehow trifled with these\r\ngreat elemental forces in whose power we lay helpless every hour of the\r\nday and night. For here, indeed, they were gigantically at play\r\ntogether, and the sight appealed to the imagination.\r\n\r\nBut my emotion, so far as I could understand it, seemed to attach itself\r\nmore particularly to the willow bushes, to these acres and acres of\r\nwillows, crowding, so thickly growing there, swarming everywhere the eye\r\ncould reach, pressing upon the river as though to suffocate it, standing\r\nin dense array mile after mile beneath the sky, watching, waiting,\r\nlistening. And, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected\r\nthemselves subtly with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously\r\nsomehow by reason of their vast numbers, and contriving in some way or\r\nother to represent to the imagination a new and mighty power, a power,\r\nmoreover, not altogether friendly to us.\r\n\r\nGreat revelations of nature, of course, never fail to impress in one way\r\nor another, and I was no stranger to moods of the kind. Mountains\r\noverawe and oceans terrify, while the mystery of great forests exercises\r\na spell peculiarly its own. But all these, at one point or another,\r\nsomewhere link on intimately with human life and human experience. They\r\nstir comprehensible, even if alarming, emotions. They tend on the whole\r\nto exalt.\r\n\r\nWith this multitude of willows, however, it was something far different,\r\nI felt. Some essence emanated from them that besieged the heart. A sense\r\nof awe awakened, true, but of awe touched somewhere by a vague terror.\r\nTheir serried ranks growing everywhere darker about me as the shadows\r\ndeepened, moving furiously yet softly in the wind, woke in me the\r\ncurious and unwelcome suggestion that we had trespassed here upon the\r\nborders of an alien world, a world where we were intruders, a world\r\nwhere we were not wanted or invited to remain--where we ran grave risks\r\nperhaps!\r\n\r\nThe feeling, however, though it refused to yield its meaning entirely to\r\nanalysis, did not at the time trouble me by passing into menace. Yet it\r\nnever left me quite, even during the very practical business of putting\r\nup the tent in a hurricane of wind and building a fire for the stew-pot.\r\nIt remained, just enough to bother and perplex, and to rob a most\r\ndelightful camping-ground of a good portion of its charm. To my\r\ncompanion, however, I said nothing, for he was a man I considered devoid\r\nof imagination. In the first place, I could never have explained to him\r\nwhat I meant, and in the second, he would have laughed stupidly at me if\r\nI had.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight depression in the center of the island, and here we\r\npitched the tent. The surrounding willows broke the wind a bit.\r\n\r\n\"A poor camp,\" observed the imperturbable Swede when at last the tent\r\nstood upright; \"no stones and precious little firewood. I'm for moving\r\non early to-morrow--eh? This sand won't hold anything.\"\r\n\r\nBut the experience of a collapsing tent at midnight had taught us many\r\ndevices, and we made the cosy gipsy house as safe as possible, and then\r\nset about collecting a store of wood to last till bedtime. Willow bushes\r\ndrop no branches, and driftwood was our only source of supply. We hunted\r\nthe shores pretty thoroughly. Everywhere the banks were crumbling as the\r\nrising flood tore at them and carried away great portions with a splash\r\nand a gurgle.\r\n\r\n\"The island's much smaller than when we landed,\" said the accurate\r\nSwede. \"It won't last long at this rate. We'd better drag the canoe\r\nclose to the tent, and be ready to start at a moment's notice. _I_ shall\r\nsleep in my clothes.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a little distance off, climbing along the bank, and I heard his\r\nrather jolly laugh as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" I heard him call, a moment later, and turned to see what had\r\ncaused his exclamation; but for the moment he was hidden by the willows,\r\nand I could not find him.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world's this?\" I heard him cry again, and this time his\r\nvoice had become serious.\r\n\r\nI ran up quickly and joined him on the bank. He was looking over the\r\nriver, pointing at something in the water.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens, it's a man's body!\" he cried excitedly. \"Look!\"\r\n\r\nA black thing, turning over and over in the foaming waves, swept rapidly\r\npast. It kept disappearing and coming up to the surface again. It was\r\nabout twenty feet from the shore, and just as it was opposite to where\r\nwe stood it lurched round and looked straight at us. We saw its eyes\r\nreflecting the sunset, and gleaming an odd yellow as the body turned\r\nover. Then it gave a swift, gulping plunge, and dived out of sight in a\r\nflash.\r\n\r\n\"An otter, by gad!\" we exclaimed in the same breath, laughing.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ an otter, alive, and out on the hunt; yet it had looked exactly\r\nlike the body of a drowned man turning helplessly in the current. Far\r\nbelow it came to the surface once again, and we saw its black skin, wet\r\nand shining in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThen, too, just as we turned back, our arms full of driftwood, another\r\nthing happened to recall us to the river bank. This time it really was a\r\nman, and what was more, a man in a boat. Now a small boat on the Danube\r\nwas an unusual sight at any time, but here in this deserted region, and\r\nat flood time, it was so unexpected as to constitute a real event. We\r\nstood and stared.\r\n\r\nWhether it was due to the slanting sunlight, or the refraction from the\r\nwonderfully illumined water, I cannot say, but, whatever the cause, I\r\nfound it difficult to focus my sight properly upon the flying\r\napparition. It seemed, however, to be a man standing upright in a sort\r\nof flat-bottomed boat, steering with a long oar, and being carried down\r\nthe opposite shore at a tremendous pace. He apparently was looking\r\nacross in our direction, but the distance was too great and the light\r\ntoo uncertain for us to make out very plainly what he was about. It\r\nseemed to me that he was gesticulating and making signs at us. His voice\r\ncame across the water to us shouting something furiously but the wind\r\ndrowned it so that no single word was audible. There was something\r\ncurious about the whole appearance--man, boat, signs, voice--that made\r\nan impression on me out of all proportion to its cause.\r\n\r\n\"He's crossing himself!\" I cried. \"Look, he's making the sign of the\r\ncross!\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you're right,\" the Swede said, shading his eyes with his hand\r\nand watching the man out of sight. He seemed to be gone in a moment,\r\nmelting away down there into the sea of willows where the sun caught\r\nthem in the bend of the river and turned them into a great crimson wall\r\nof beauty. Mist, too, had begun to rise, so that the air was hazy.\r\n\r\n\"But what in the world is he doing at nightfall on this flooded river?\"\r\nI said, half to myself. \"Where is he going at such a time, and what did\r\nhe mean by his signs and shouting? D'you think he wished to warn us\r\nabout something?\"\r\n\r\n\"He saw our smoke, and thought we were spirits probably,\" laughed my\r\ncompanion. \"These Hungarians believe in all sorts of rubbish: you\r\nremember the shopwoman at Pressburg warning us that no one ever landed\r\nhere because it belonged to some sort of beings outside man's world! I\r\nsuppose they believe in fairies and elementals, possibly demons too.\r\nThat peasant in the boat saw people on the islands for the first time in\r\nhis life,\" he added, after a slight pause, \"and it scared him, that's\r\nall.\" The Swede's tone of voice was not convincing, and his manner\r\nlacked something that was usually there. I noted the change instantly\r\nwhile he talked, though without being able to label it precisely.\r\n\r\n\"If they had enough imagination,\" I laughed loudly--I remember trying to\r\nmake as much _noise_ as I could--\"they might well people a place like\r\nthis with the old gods of antiquity. The Romans must have haunted all\r\nthis region more or less with their shrines and sacred groves and\r\nelemental deities.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject dropped and we returned to our stew-pot, for my friend was\r\nnot given to imaginative conversation as a rule. Moreover, just then I\r\nremember feeling distinctly glad that he was not imaginative; his\r\nstolid, practical nature suddenly seemed to me welcome and comforting.\r\nIt was an admirable temperament, I felt: he could steer down rapids like\r\na red Indian, shoot dangerous bridges and whirlpools better than any\r\nwhite man I ever saw in a canoe. He was a grand fellow for an\r\nadventurous trip, a tower of strength when untoward things happened. I\r\nlooked at his strong face and light curly hair as he staggered along\r\nunder his pile of driftwood (twice the size of mine!), and I experienced\r\na feeling of relief. Yes, I was distinctly glad just then that the Swede\r\nwas--what he was, and that he never made remarks that suggested more\r\nthan they said.\r\n\r\n\"The river's still rising, though,\" he added, as if following out some\r\nthoughts of his own, and dropping his load with a gasp. \"This island\r\nwill be under water in two days if it goes on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish the _wind_ would go down,\" I said. \"I don't care a fig for the\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\nThe flood, indeed, had no terrors for us; we could get off at ten\r\nminutes' notice, and the more water the better we liked it. It meant an\r\nincreasing current and the obliteration of the treacherous shingle-beds\r\nthat so often threatened to tear the bottom out of our canoe.\r\n\r\nContrary to our expectations, the wind did not go down with the sun. It\r\nseemed to increase with the darkness, howling overhead and shaking the\r\nwillows round us like straws. Curious sounds accompanied it sometimes,\r\nlike the explosion of heavy guns, and it fell upon the water and the\r\nisland in great flat blows of immense power. It made me think of the\r\nsounds a planet must make, could we only hear it, driving along through\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nBut the sky kept wholly clear of clouds, and soon after supper the full\r\nmoon rose up in the east and covered the river and the plain of shouting\r\nwillows with a light like the day.\r\n\r\nWe lay on the sandy patch beside the fire, smoking, listening to the\r\nnoises of the night round us, and talking happily of the journey we had\r\nalready made, and of our plans ahead. The map lay spread in the door of\r\nthe tent, but the high wind made it hard to study, and presently we\r\nlowered the curtain and extinguished the lantern. The firelight was\r\nenough to smoke and see each other's faces by, and the sparks flew about\r\noverhead like fireworks. A few yards beyond, the river gurgled and\r\nhissed, and from time to time a heavy splash announced the falling away\r\nof further portions of the bank.\r\n\r\nOur talk, I noticed, had to do with the far-away scenes and incidents of\r\nour first camps in the Black Forest, or of other subjects altogether\r\nremote from the present setting, for neither of us spoke of the actual\r\nmoment more than was necessary--almost as though we had agreed tacitly\r\nto avoid discussion of the camp and its incidents. Neither the otter nor\r\nthe boatman, for instance, received the honor of a single mention,\r\nthough ordinarily these would have furnished discussion for the greater\r\npart of the evening. They were, of course, distinct events in such a\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of wood made it a business to keep the fire going, for the\r\nwind, that drove the smoke in our faces wherever we sat, helped at the\r\nsame time to make a forced draught. We took it in turn to make foraging\r\nexpeditions into the darkness, and the quantity the Swede brought back\r\nalways made me feel that he took an absurdly long time finding it; for\r\nthe fact was I did not care much about being left alone, and yet it\r\nalways seemed to be my turn to grub about among the bushes or scramble\r\nalong the slippery banks in the moonlight. The long day's battle with\r\nwind and water--such wind and such water!--had tired us both, and an\r\nearly bed was the obvious program. Yet neither of us made the move for\r\nthe tent. We lay there, tending the fire, talking in desultory fashion,\r\npeering about us into the dense willow bushes, and listening to the\r\nthunder of wind and river. The loneliness of the place had entered our\r\nvery bones, and silence seemed natural, for after a bit the sound of our\r\nvoices became a trifle unreal and forced; whispering would have been the\r\nfitting mode of communication, I felt, and the human voice, always\r\nrather absurd amid the roar of the elements, now carried with it\r\nsomething almost illegitimate. It was like talking out loud in church,\r\nor in some place where it was not lawful, perhaps not quite _safe_, to\r\nbe overheard.\r\n\r\nThe eeriness of this lonely island, set among a million willows, swept\r\nby a hurricane, and surrounded by hurrying deep waters, touched us both,\r\nI fancy. Untrodden by man, almost unknown to man, it lay there beneath\r\nthe moon, remote from human influence, on the frontier of another world,\r\nan alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of\r\nwillows. And we, in our rashness, had dared to invade it, even to make\r\nuse of it! Something more than the power of its mystery stirred in me as\r\nI lay on the sand, feet to fire, and peered up through the leaves at the\r\nstars. For the last time I rose to get firewood.\r\n\r\n\"When this has burnt up,\" I said firmly, \"I shall turn in,\" and my\r\ncompanion watched me lazily as I moved off into the surrounding\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nFor an unimaginative man I thought he seemed unusually receptive that\r\nnight, unusually open to suggestion of things other than sensory. He too\r\nwas touched by the beauty and loneliness of the place. I was not\r\naltogether pleased, I remember, to recognize this slight change in him,\r\nand instead of immediately collecting sticks, I made my way to the far\r\npoint of the island where the moonlight on plain and river could be seen\r\nto better advantage. The desire to be alone had come suddenly upon me;\r\nmy former dread returned in force; there was a vague feeling in me I\r\nwished to face and probe to the bottom.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the point of sand jutting out among the waves, the spell\r\nof the place descended upon me with a positive shock. No mere \"scenery\"\r\ncould have produced such an effect. There was something more here,\r\nsomething to alarm.\r\n\r\nI gazed across the waste of wild waters; I watched the whispering\r\nwillows; I heard the ceaseless beating of the tireless wind; and, one\r\nand all, each in its own way, stirred in me this sensation of a strange\r\ndistress. But the _willows_ especially: for ever they went on chattering\r\nand talking among themselves, laughing a little, shrilly crying out,\r\nsometimes sighing--but what it was they made so much to-do about\r\nbelonged to the secret life of the great plain they inhabited. And it\r\nwas utterly alien to the world I knew, or to that of the wild yet\r\nkindly elements. They made me think of a host of beings from another\r\nplane of life, another evolution altogether, perhaps, all discussing a\r\nmystery known only to themselves. I watched them moving busily together,\r\noddly shaking their big bushy heads, twirling their myriad leaves even\r\nwhen there was no wind. They moved of their own will as though alive,\r\nand they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keen sense of the\r\n_horrible_.\r\n\r\nThere they stood in the moonlight, like a vast army surrounding our\r\ncamp, shaking their innumerable silver spears defiantly, formed all\r\nready for an attack.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of places, for some imaginations at least, is very vivid;\r\nfor the wanderer, especially, camps have their \"note\" either of welcome\r\nor rejection. At first it may not always be apparent, because the busy\r\npreparations of tent and cooking prevent, but with the first\r\npause--after supper usually--it comes and announces itself. And the note\r\nof this willow-camp now became unmistakably plain to me: we were\r\ninterlopers, trespassers, we were not welcomed. The sense of\r\nunfamiliarity grew upon me as I stood there watching. We touched the\r\nfrontier of a region where our presence was resented. For a night's\r\nlodging we might perhaps be tolerated; but for a prolonged and\r\ninquisitive stay--No! by all the gods of the trees and the wilderness,\r\nno! We were the first human influences upon this island, and we were not\r\nwanted. _The willows were against us_.\r\n\r\nStrange thoughts like these, bizarre fancies, borne I know not whence,\r\nfound lodgment in my mind as I stood listening. What, I thought, if,\r\nafter all, these crouching willows proved to be alive; if suddenly they\r\nshould rise up, like a swarm of living creatures, marshaled by the gods\r\nwhose territory we had invaded, sweep towards us off the vast swamps,\r\nbooming overhead in the night--and then _settle down_! As I looked it\r\nwas so easy to imagine they actually moved, crept nearer, retreated a\r\nlittle, huddled together in masses, hostile, waiting for the great wind\r\nthat should finally start them a-running. I could have sworn their\r\naspect changed a little, and their ranks deepened and pressed more\r\nclosely together.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy shrill cry of a night bird sounded overhead, and suddenly\r\nI nearly lost my balance as the piece of bank I stood upon fell with a\r\ngreat splash into the river, undermined by the flood. I stepped back\r\njust in time, and went on hunting for firewood again, half laughing at\r\nthe odd fancies that crowded so thickly into my mind and cast their\r\nspell upon me. I recall the Swede's remark about moving on next day, and\r\nI was just thinking that I fully agreed with him, when I turned with a\r\nstart and saw the subject of my thoughts standing immediately in front\r\nof me. He was quite close. The roar of the elements had covered his\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\"You've been gone so long,\" he shouted above the wind, \"I thought\r\nsomething must have happened to you.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was that in his tone, and a certain look in his face as well,\r\nthat conveyed to me more than his actual words, and in a flash I\r\nunderstood the real reason for his coming. It was because the spell of\r\nthe place had entered his soul too, and he did not like being alone.\r\n\r\n\"River still rising,\" he cried, pointing to the flood in the moonlight,\r\n\"and the wind's simply awful.\"\r\n\r\nHe always said the same things, but it was the cry for companionship\r\nthat gave the real importance to his words.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky,\" I cried back, \"our tent's in the hollow. I think it'll hold all\r\nright.\" I added something about the difficulty of finding wood, in order\r\nto explain my absence, but the wind caught my words and flung them\r\nacross the river, so that he did not hear, but just looked at me through\r\nthe branches, nodding his head.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky if we get away without disaster!\" he shouted, or words to that\r\neffect; and I remember feeling half angry with him for putting the\r\nthought into words, for it was exactly what I felt myself. There was\r\ndisaster impending somewhere, and the sense of presentiment lay\r\nunpleasantly upon me.\r\n\r\nWe went back to the fire and made a final blaze, poking it up with our\r\nfeet. We took a last look round. But for the wind the heat would have\r\nbeen unpleasant. I put this thought into words, and I remember my\r\nfriend's reply struck me oddly: that he would rather have the heat, the\r\nordinary July weather, than this \"diabolical wind.\"\r\n\r\nEverything was snug for the night; the canoe lying turned over beside\r\nthe tent, with both yellow paddles beneath her; the provision sack\r\nhanging from a willow stem, and the washed-up dishes removed to a safe\r\ndistance from the fire, all ready for the morning meal.\r\n\r\nWe smothered the embers of the fire with sand, and then turned in. The\r\nflap of the tent door was up, and I saw the branches and the stars and\r\nthe white moonlight. The shaking willows and the heavy buffetings of the\r\nwind against our taut little house were the last things I remembered as\r\nsleep came down and covered all with its soft and delicious\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSuddenly I found myself lying awake, peering from my sandy mattress\r\nthrough the door of the tent. I looked at my watch pinned against the\r\ncanvas, and saw by the bright moonlight that it was past twelve\r\no'clock--the threshold of a new day--and I had therefore slept a couple\r\nof hours. The Swede was asleep still beside me; the wind howled as\r\nbefore something plucked at my heart and made me feel afraid. There was\r\na sense of disturbance in my immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI sat up quickly and looked out. The trees were swaying violently to and\r\nfro as the gusts smote them, but our little bit of green canvas lay\r\nsnugly safe in the hollow, for the wind passed over it without meeting\r\nenough resistance to make it vicious. The feeling of disquietude did not\r\npass however, and I crawled quietly out of the tent to see if our\r\nbelongings were safe. I moved carefully so as not to waken my companion.\r\nA curious excitement was on me.\r\n\r\nI was halfway out, kneeling on all fours, when my eye first took in that\r\nthe tops of the bushes opposite, with their moving tracery of leaves,\r\nmade shapes against the sky. I sat back on my haunches and stared. It\r\nwas incredible, surely, but there, opposite and slightly above me, were\r\nshapes of some indeterminate sort among the willows, and as the branches\r\nswayed in the wind they seemed to group themselves about these shapes,\r\nforming a series of monstrous outlines that shifted rapidly beneath the\r\nmoon. Close, about fifty feet in front of me, I saw these things.\r\n\r\nMy first instinct was to waken my companion that he too might see them,\r\nbut something made me hesitate--the sudden realization, probably, that I\r\nshould not welcome corroboration; and meanwhile I crouched there staring\r\nin amazement with smarting eyes. I was wide awake. I remember saying to\r\nmyself that I was _not_ dreaming.\r\n\r\nThey first became properly visible, these huge figures, just within the\r\ntops of the bushes--immense bronze-colored, moving, and wholly\r\nindependent of the swaying of the branches. I saw them plainly and\r\nnoted, now I came to examine them more calmly, that they were very much\r\nlarger than human, and indeed that something in their appearance\r\nproclaimed them to be _not human_ at all. Certainly they were not merely\r\nthe moving tracery of the branches against the moonlight. They shifted\r\nindependently. They rose upwards in a continuous stream from earth to\r\nsky, vanishing utterly as soon as they reached the dark of the sky. They\r\nwere interlaced one with another, making a great column, and I saw their\r\nlimbs and huge bodies melting in and out of each other, forming this\r\nserpentine line that bent and swayed and twisted spirally with the\r\ncontortions of the wind-tossed trees. They were nude, fluid shapes,\r\npassing up the bushes, _within_ the leaves almost--rising up in a living\r\ncolumn into the heavens. Their faces I never could see. Unceasingly they\r\npoured upwards, swaying in great bending curves, with a hue of dull\r\nbronze upon their skins.\r\n\r\nI stared, trying to force every atom of vision from my eyes. For a long\r\ntime I thought they _must_ every moment disappear and resolve themselves\r\ninto the movements of the branches and prove to be an optical illusion.\r\nI searched everywhere for a proof of reality, when all the while I\r\nunderstood quite well that the standard of reality had changed. For the\r\nlonger I looked the more certain I became that these figures were real\r\nand living, though perhaps not according to the standards that the\r\ncamera and the biologist would insist upon.\r\n\r\nFar from feeling fear, I was possessed with a sense of awe and wonder\r\nsuch as I have never known. I seemed to be gazing at the personified\r\nelemental forces of this haunted and primeval region. Our intrusion had\r\nstirred the powers of the place into activity. It was we who were the\r\ncause of the disturbance, and my brain filled to bursting with stories\r\nand legends of the spirits and deities of places that have been\r\nacknowledged and worshiped by men in all ages of the world's history.\r\nBut, before I could arrive at any possible explanation, something\r\nimpelled me to go farther out, and I crept forward on to the sand and\r\nstood upright. I felt the ground still warm under my bare feet; the wind\r\ntore at my hair and face; and the sound of the river burst upon my ears\r\nwith a sudden roar. These things, I knew, were real, and proved that my\r\nsenses were acting normally. Yet the figures still rose from earth to\r\nheaven, silent, majestically, in a great spiral of grace and strength\r\nthat overwhelmed me at length with a genuine deep emotion of worship. I\r\nfelt that I must fall down and worship--absolutely worship.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in another minute I might have done so, when a gust of wind\r\nswept against me with such force that it blew me sideways, and I nearly\r\nstumbled and fell. It seemed to shake the dream violently out of me. At\r\nleast it gave me another point of view somehow. The figures still\r\nremained, still ascended into heaven from the heart of the night, but my\r\nreason at last began to assert itself. It must be a subjective\r\nexperience, I argued--none the less real for that, but still subjective.\r\nThe moonlight and the branches combined to work out these pictures upon\r\nthe mirror of my imagination, and for some reason I projected them\r\noutwards and made them appear objective. I knew this must be the case,\r\nof course. I was the subject of a vivid and interesting hallucination. I\r\ntook courage, and began to move forward across the open patches of sand.\r\nBy Jove, though, was it all hallucination? Was it merely subjective? Did\r\nnot my reason argue in the old futile way from the little standard of\r\nthe known?\r\n\r\nI only know that great column of figures ascended darkly into the sky\r\nfor what seemed a very long period of time, and with a very complete\r\nmeasure of reality as most men are accustomed to gauge reality. Then\r\nsuddenly they were gone!\r\n\r\nAnd, once they were gone and the immediate wonder of their great\r\npresence had passed, fear came down upon me with a cold rush. The\r\nesoteric meaning of this lonely and haunted region suddenly flamed up\r\nwithin me and I began to tremble dreadfully. I took a quick look\r\nround--a look of horror that came near to panic--calculating vainly ways\r\nof escape; and then, realizing how helpless I was to achieve anything\r\nreally effective, I crept back silently into the tent and lay down again\r\nupon my sandy mattress, first lowering the door-curtain to shut out the\r\nsight of the willows in the moonlight, and then burying my head as\r\ndeeply as possible beneath the blankets to deaden the sound of the\r\nterrifying wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAs though further to convince me that I had not been dreaming, I\r\nremember that it was a long time before I fell again into a troubled and\r\nrestless sleep; and even then only the upper crust of me slept, and\r\nunderneath there was something that never quite lost consciousness, but\r\nlay alert and on the watch.\r\n\r\nBut this second time I jumped up with a genuine start of terror. It was\r\nneither the wind nor the river that woke me, but the slow approach of\r\nsomething that caused the sleeping portion of me to grow smaller and\r\nsmaller till at last it vanished altogether, and I found myself sitting\r\nbolt upright--listening.\r\n\r\nOutside there was a sound of multitudinous little patterings. They had\r\nbeen coming, I was aware, for a long time, and in my sleep they had\r\nfirst become audible. I sat there nervously wide awake as though I had\r\nnot slept at all. It seemed to me that my breathing came with\r\ndifficulty, and that there was a great weight upon the surface of my\r\nbody. In spite of the hot night, I felt clammy with cold and shivered.\r\nSomething surely was pressing steadily against the sides of the tent and\r\nweighing down upon it from above. Was it the body of the wind? Was this\r\nthe pattering rain, the dripping of the leaves? The spray blown from\r\nthe river by the wind and gathering in big drops? I thought quickly of a\r\ndozen things.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the explanation leaped into my mind: a bough from the\r\npoplar, the only large tree on the island, had fallen with the wind.\r\nStill half caught by the other branches, it would fall with the next\r\ngust and crush us, and meanwhile its leaves brushed and tapped upon the\r\ntight canvas surface of the tent. I raised the loose flap and rushed\r\nout, calling to the Swede to follow.\r\n\r\nBut when I got out and stood upright I saw that the tent was free. There\r\nwas no hanging bough; there was no rain or spray; nothing approached.\r\n\r\nA cold, gray light filtered down through the bushes and lay on the\r\nfaintly gleaming sand. Stars still crowded the sky directly overhead,\r\nand the wind howled magnificently, but the fire no longer gave out any\r\nglow, and I saw the east reddening in streaks through the trees. Several\r\nhours must have passed since I stood there before, watching the\r\nascending figures, and the memory of it now came back to me horribly,\r\nlike an evil dream. Oh, how tired it made me feel, that ceaseless raging\r\nwind! Yet, though the deep lassitude of a sleepless night was on me, my\r\nnerves were tingling with the activity of an equally tireless\r\napprehension, and all idea of repose was out of the question. The river\r\nI saw had risen further. Its thunder filled the air, and a fine spray\r\nmade itself felt through my thin sleeping shirt.\r\n\r\nYet nowhere did I discover the slightest evidences of anything to cause\r\nalarm. This deep, prolonged disturbance in my heart remained wholly\r\nunaccounted for.\r\n\r\nMy companion had not stirred when I called him, and there was no need to\r\nwaken him now. I looked about me carefully, noting everything: the\r\nturned-over canoe; the yellow paddles--two of them, I'm certain; the\r\nprovision sack and the extra lantern hanging together from the tree;\r\nand, crowding everywhere about me, enveloping all, the willows, those\r\nendless, shaking willows. A bird uttered its morning cry, and a string\r\nof duck passed with whirring flight overhead in the twilight. The sand\r\nwhirled, dry and stinging, about my bare feet in the wind.\r\n\r\nI walked round the tent and then went out a little way into the bush, so\r\nthat I could see across the river to the farther landscape, and the same\r\nprofound yet indefinable emotion of distress seized upon me again as I\r\nsaw the interminable sea of bushes stretching to the horizon, looking\r\nghostly and unreal in the wan light of dawn. I walked softly here and\r\nthere, still puzzling over that odd sound of infinite pattering, and of\r\nthat pressure upon the tent that had wakened me. It _must_ have been the\r\nwind, I reflected--the wind beating upon the loose, hot sand, driving\r\nthe dry particles smartly against the taut canvas--the wind dropping\r\nheavily upon our fragile roof.\r\n\r\nYet all the time my nervousness and malaise increased appreciably.\r\n\r\nI crossed over to the farther shore and noted how the coast line had\r\naltered in the night, and what masses of sand the river had torn away. I\r\ndipped my hands and feet into the cool current, and bathed my forehead.\r\nAlready there was a glow of sunrise in the sky and the exquisite\r\nfreshness of coming day. On my way back I passed purposely beneath the\r\nvery bushes where I had seen the column of figures rising into the air,\r\nand midway among the clumps I suddenly found myself overtaken by a sense\r\nof vast terror. From the shadows a large figure went swiftly by. Some\r\none passed me, as sure as ever man did....\r\n\r\nIt was a great staggering blow from the wind that helped me forward\r\nagain, and once out in the more open space, the sense of terror\r\ndiminished strangely. The winds were about and walking, I remember\r\nsaying to myself; for the winds often move like great presences under\r\nthe trees. And altogether the fear that hovered about me was such an\r\nunknown and immense kind of fear, so unlike anything I had ever felt\r\nbefore, that it woke a sense of awe and wonder in me that did much to\r\ncounteract its worst effects; and when I reached a high point in the\r\nmiddle of the island from which I could see the wide stretch of river,\r\ncrimson in the sunrise, the whole magical beauty of it all was so\r\noverpowering that a sort of wild yearning woke in me and almost brought\r\na cry up into the throat.\r\n\r\nBut this cry found no expression, for as my eyes wandered from the plain\r\nbeyond to the island round me and noted our little tent half hidden\r\namong the willows, a dreadful discovery leaped out at me, compared to\r\nwhich my terror of the walking winds seemed as nothing at all.\r\n\r\nFor a change, I thought, had somehow come about in the arrangement of\r\nthe landscape. It was not that my point of vantage gave me a different\r\nview, but that an alteration had apparently been effected in the\r\nrelation of the tent to the willows, and of the willows to the tent.\r\nSurely the bushes now crowded much closer--unnecessarily, unpleasantly\r\nclose. _They had moved nearer_.\r\n\r\nCreeping with silent feet over the shifting sands, drawing imperceptibly\r\nnearer by soft, unhurried movements, the willows had come closer during\r\nthe night. But had the wind moved them, or had they moved of themselves?\r\nI recalled the sound of infinite small patterings and the pressure upon\r\nthe tent and upon my own heart that caused me to wake in terror. I\r\nswayed for a moment in the wind like a tree, finding it hard to keep my\r\nupright position on the sandy hillock. There was a suggestion here of\r\npersonal agency, of deliberate intention, of aggressive hostility, and\r\nit terrified me into a sort of rigidity.\r\n\r\nThen the reaction followed quickly. The idea was so bizarre, so absurd,\r\nthat I felt inclined to laugh. But the laughter came no more readily\r\nthan the cry, for the knowledge that my mind was so receptive to such\r\ndangerous imaginings brought the additional terror that it was through\r\nour minds and not through our physical bodies that the attack would\r\ncome, and was coming.\r\n\r\nThe wind buffeted me about, and, very quickly it seemed, the sun came up\r\nover the horizon, for it was after four o'clock, and I must have stood\r\non that little pinnacle of sand longer than I knew, afraid to come down\r\nat close quarters with the willows. I returned quietly, creepily, to the\r\ntent, first taking another exhaustive look round and--yes, I confess\r\nit--making a few measurements. I paced out on the warm sand the\r\ndistances between the willows and the tent, making a note of the\r\nshortest distance particularly.\r\n\r\nI crawled stealthily into my blankets. My companion, to all appearances,\r\nstill slept soundly, and I was glad that this was so. Provided my\r\nexperiences were not corroborated, I could find strength somehow to deny\r\nthem, perhaps. With the daylight I could persuade myself that it was all\r\na subjective hallucination, a fantasy of the night, a projection of the\r\nexcited imagination.\r\n\r\nNothing further came to disturb me, and I fell asleep almost at once,\r\nutterly exhausted, yet still in dread of hearing again that weird sound\r\nof multitudinous pattering, or of feeling the pressure upon my heart\r\nthat had made it difficult to breathe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe sun was high in the heavens when my companion woke me from a heavy\r\nsleep and announced that the porridge was cooked and there was just\r\ntime to bathe. The grateful smell of frizzling bacon entered the tent\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"River still rising,\" he said, \"and several islands out in midstream\r\nhave disappeared altogether. Our own island's much smaller.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any wood left?\" I asked sleepily.\r\n\r\n\"The wood and the island will finish to-morrow in a dead heat,\" he\r\nlaughed, \"but there's enough to last us till then.\"\r\n\r\nI plunged in from the point of the island, which had indeed altered a\r\nlot in size and shape during the night, and was swept down in a moment\r\nto the landing place opposite the tent. The water was icy, and the banks\r\nflew by like the country from an express train. Bathing under such\r\nconditions was an exhilarating operation, and the terror of the night\r\nseemed cleansed out of me by a process of evaporation in the brain. The\r\nsun was blazing hot; not a cloud showed itself anywhere; the wind,\r\nhowever, had not abated one little jot.\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly then the implied meaning of the Swede's words flashed\r\nacross me, showing that he no longer wished to leave posthaste, and had\r\nchanged his mind. \"Enough to last till to-morrow\"--he assumed we should\r\nstay on the island another night. It struck me as odd. The night before\r\nhe was so positive the other way. How had the change come about?\r\n\r\nGreat crumblings of the banks occurred at breakfast, with heavy\r\nsplashings and clouds of spray which the wind brought into our\r\nfrying-pan, and my fellow-traveler talked incessantly about the\r\ndifficulty the Vienna-Pesth steamers must have to find the channel in\r\nflood. But the state of his mind interested and impressed me far more\r\nthan the state of the river or the difficulties of the steamers. He had\r\nchanged somehow since the evening before. His manner was different--a\r\ntrifle excited, a trifle shy, with a sort of suspicion about his voice\r\nand gestures. I hardly know how to describe it now in cold blood, but at\r\nthe time I remember being quite certain of one thing, viz., that he had\r\nbecome frightened!\r\n\r\nHe ate very little breakfast, and for once omitted to smoke his pipe. He\r\nhad the map spread open beside him, and kept studying its markings.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better get off sharp in an hour,\" I said presently, feeling for an\r\nopening that must bring him indirectly to a partial confession at any\r\nrate. And his answer puzzled me uncomfortably: \"Rather! If they'll let\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who'll let us? The elements?\" I asked quickly, with affected\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n\"The powers of this awful place, whoever they are,\" he replied, keeping\r\nhis eyes on the map. \"The gods are here, if they are anywhere at all in\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\n\"The elements are always the true immortals,\" I replied, laughing as\r\nnaturally as I could manage, yet knowing quite well that my face\r\nreflected my true feelings when he looked up gravely at me and spoke\r\nacross the smoke:\r\n\r\n\"We shall be fortunate if we get away without further disaster.\"\r\n\r\nThis was exactly what I had dreaded, and I screwed myself up to the\r\npoint of the direct question. It was like agreeing to allow the dentist\r\nto extract the tooth; it _had_ to come anyhow in the long run, and the\r\nrest was all pretense.\r\n\r\n\"Further disaster! Why, what's happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"For one thing--the steering paddle's gone,\" he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"The steering paddle gone!\" I repeated, greatly excited, for this was\r\nour rudder, and the Danube in flood without a rudder was suicide. \"But\r\nwhat----\"\r\n\r\n\"And there's a tear in the bottom of the canoe,\" he added, with a\r\ngenuine little tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\nI continued staring at him, able only to repeat the words in his face\r\nsomewhat foolishly. There, in the heat of the sun, and on this burning\r\nsand, I was aware of a freezing atmosphere descending round us. I got up\r\nto follow him, for he merely nodded his head gravely and led the way\r\ntowards the tent a few yards on the other side of the fireplace. The\r\ncanoe still lay there as I had last seen her in the night, ribs\r\nuppermost, the paddles, or rather, _the_ paddle, on the sand beside her.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one,\" he said, stooping to pick it up. \"And here's the\r\nrent in the base-board.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that I had clearly noticed\r\n_two_ paddles a few hours before, but a second impulse made me think\r\nbetter of it, and I said nothing. I approached to see.\r\n\r\nThere was a long, finely made tear in the bottom of the canoe where a\r\nlittle slither of wood had been neatly taken clean out; it looked as if\r\nthe tooth of a sharp rock or snag had eaten down her length, and\r\ninvestigation showed that the hole went through. Had we launched out in\r\nher without observing it we must inevitably have foundered. At first the\r\nwater would have made the wood swell so as to close the hole, but once\r\nout in midstream the water must have poured in, and the canoe, never\r\nmore than two inches above the surface, would have filled and sunk very\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n\"There, you see, an attempt to prepare a victim for the sacrifice,\" I\r\nheard him saying, more to himself than to me, \"two victims rather,\" he\r\nadded as he bent over and ran his fingers along the slit.\r\n\r\nI began to whistle--a thing I always do unconsciously when utterly\r\nnonplused--and purposely paid no attention to his words. I was\r\ndetermined to consider them foolish.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't there last night,\" he said presently, straightening up from\r\nhis examination and looking anywhere but at me.\r\n\r\n\"We must have scratched her in landing, of course,\" I stopped whistling\r\nto say, \"The stones are very sharp----\"\r\n\r\nI stopped abruptly, for at that moment he turned round and met my eye\r\nsquarely. I knew just as well as he did how impossible my explanation\r\nwas. There were no stones, to begin with.\r\n\r\n\"And then there's this to explain too,\" he added quietly, handing me the\r\npaddle and pointing to the blade.\r\n\r\nA new and curious emotion spread freezingly over me as I took and\r\nexamined it. The blade was scraped down all over, beautifully scraped,\r\nas though someone had sand-papered it with care, making it so thin that\r\nthe first vigorous stroke must have snapped it off at the elbow.\r\n\r\n\"One of us walked in his sleep and did this thing,\" I said feebly,\r\n\"or--or it has been filed by the constant stream of sand particles blown\r\nagainst it by the wind, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the Swede, turning away, laughing a little, \"you can explain\r\neverything!\"\r\n\r\n\"The same wind that caught the steering paddle and flung it so near the\r\nbank that it fell in with the next lump that crumbled,\" I called out\r\nafter him, absolutely determined to find an explanation for everything\r\nhe showed me.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he shouted back, turning his head to look at me before\r\ndisappearing among the willow bushes.\r\n\r\nOnce alone with these perplexing evidences of personal agency, I think\r\nmy first thought took the form of \"One of us must have done this thing,\r\nand it certainly was not I.\" But my second thought decided how\r\nimpossible it was to suppose, under all the circumstances, that either\r\nof us had done it. That my companion, the trusted friend of a dozen\r\nsimilar expeditions, could have knowingly had a hand in it, was a\r\nsuggestion not to be entertained for a moment. Equally absurd seemed the\r\nexplanation that this imperturbable and densely practical nature had\r\nsuddenly become insane and was busied with insane purposes.\r\n\r\nYet the fact remained that what disturbed me most, and kept my fear\r\nactively alive even in this blaze of sunshine and wild beauty, was the\r\nclear certainty that some curious alteration had come about in his\r\n_mind_--that he was nervous, timid, suspicious, aware of goings on he\r\ndid not speak about, watching a series of secret and hitherto\r\nunmentionable events--waiting, in a word, for a climax that he expected,\r\nand, I thought, expected very soon. This grew up in my mind\r\nintuitively--I hardly knew how.\r\n\r\nI made a hurried examination of the tent and its surroundings, but the\r\nmeasurements of the night remained the same. There were deep hollows\r\nformed in the sand, I now noticed for the first time, basin-shaped and\r\nof various depths and sizes, varying from that of a teacup to a large\r\nbowl. The wind, no doubt, was responsible for these miniature craters,\r\njust as it was for lifting the paddle and tossing it towards the water.\r\nThe rent in the canoe was the only thing that seemed quite inexplicable;\r\nand, after all, it _was_ conceivable that a sharp point had caught it\r\nwhen we landed. The examination I made of the shore did not assist this\r\ntheory, but all the same I clung to it with that diminishing portion of\r\nmy intelligence which I called my \"reason.\" An explanation of some kind\r\nwas an absolute necessity, just as some working explanation of the\r\nuniverse is necessary--however absurd--to the happiness of every\r\nindividual who seeks to do his duty in the world and face the problems\r\nof life. The simile seemed to me at the time an exact parallel.\r\n\r\nI at once set the pitch melting, and presently the Swede joined me at\r\nthe work, though under the best conditions in the world the canoe could\r\nnot be safe for traveling till the following day. I drew his attention\r\ncasually to the hollows in the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I know. They're all over the island. But _you_ can\r\nexplain them, no doubt!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wind, of course,\" I answered without hesitation. \"Have you never\r\nwatched those little whirlwinds in the street that twist and twirl\r\neverything into a circle? This sand's loose enough to yield, that's\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, and we worked on in silence for a bit. I watched him\r\nsurreptitiously all the time, and I had an idea he was watching me. He\r\nseemed, too, to be always listening attentively to something I could not\r\nhear, or perhaps for something that he expected to hear, for he kept\r\nturning about and staring into the bushes, and up into the sky, and out\r\nacross the water where it was visible through the openings among the\r\nwillows. Sometimes he even put his hand to his ear and held it there for\r\nseveral minutes. He said nothing to me, however, about it, and I asked\r\nno questions. And meanwhile, as he mended that torn canoe with the skill\r\nand address of a red Indian, I was glad to notice his absorption in the\r\nwork, for there was a vague dread in my heart that he would speak of the\r\nchanged aspect of the willows. And, if he had noticed _that_, my\r\nimagination could no longer be held a sufficient explanation of it.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a long pause, he began to talk.\r\n\r\n\"Queer thing,\" he added in a hurried sort of voice, as though he wanted\r\nto say something and get it over. \"Queer thing, I mean, about that otter\r\nlast night.\"\r\n\r\nI had expected something so totally different that he caught me with\r\nsurprise, and I looked up sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Shows how lonely this place is. Otters are awfully shy things--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean that, of course,\" he interrupted. \"I mean--do you\r\nthink--did you think it really was an otter?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else, in the name of Heaven, what else?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, I saw it before you did, and at first it seemed--so _much_\r\nbigger than an otter.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sunset as you looked upstream magnified it, or something,\" I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me absently a moment, as though his mind were busy with\r\nother thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"It had such extraordinary yellow eyes,\" he went on half to himself.\r\n\r\n\"That was the sun too,\" I laughed, a trifle boisterously. \"I suppose\r\nyou'll wonder next if that fellow in the boat----\"\r\n\r\nI suddenly decided not to finish the sentence. He was in the act again\r\nof listening, turning his head to the wind, and something in the\r\nexpression of his face made me halt. The subject dropped, and we went on\r\nwith our caulking. Apparently he had not noticed my unfinished sentence.\r\nFive minutes later, however, he looked at me across the canoe, the\r\nsmoking pitch in his hand, his face exceedingly grave.\r\n\r\n\"I _did_ rather wonder, if you want to know,\" he said slowly, \"what that\r\nthing in the boat was. I remember thinking at the time it was not a man.\r\nThe whole business seemed to rise quite suddenly out of the water.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed again boisterously in his face, but this time there was\r\nimpatience and a strain of anger too, in my feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Look here now,\" I cried, \"this place is quite queer enough without\r\ngoing out of our way to imagine things! That boat was an ordinary boat,\r\nand the man in it was an ordinary man, and they were both going\r\ndownstream as fast as they could lick. And that otter _was_ an otter, so\r\ndon't let's play the fool about it!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked steadily at me with the same grave expression. He was not in\r\nthe least annoyed. I took courage from his silence.\r\n\r\n\"And for heaven's sake,\" I went on, \"don't keep pretending you hear\r\nthings, because it only gives me the jumps, and there's nothing to hear\r\nbut the river and this cursed old thundering wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _fool_!\" he answered in a low, shocked voice, \"you utter fool.\r\nThat's just the way all victims talk. As if you didn't understand just\r\nas well as I do!\" he sneered with scorn in his voice, and a sort of\r\nresignation. \"The best thing you can do is to keep quiet and try to hold\r\nyour mind as firm as possible. This feeble attempt at self-deception\r\nonly makes the truth harder when you're forced to meet it.\"\r\n\r\nMy little effort was over, and I found nothing more to say, for I knew\r\nquite well his words were true, and that I was the fool, not _he_. Up to\r\na certain stage in the adventure he kept ahead of me easily, and I think\r\nI felt annoyed to be out of it, to be thus proved less psychic, less\r\nsensitive than himself to these extraordinary happenings, and half\r\nignorant all the time of what was going on under my very nose. _He knew_\r\nfrom the very beginning, apparently. But at the moment I wholly missed\r\nthe point of his words about the necessity of there being a victim, and\r\nthat we ourselves were destined to satisfy the want. I dropped all\r\npretense thenceforward, but thenceforward likewise my fear increased\r\nsteadily to the climax.\r\n\r\n\"But you're quite right about one thing,\" he added, before the subject\r\npassed, \"and that is that we're wiser not to talk about it, or even to\r\nthink about it, because what one _thinks_ finds expression in words, and\r\nwhat one _says_, happens.\"\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, while the canoe dried and hardened, we spent trying to\r\nfish, testing the leak, collecting wood, and watching the enormous flood\r\nof rising water. Masses of driftwood swept near our shores sometimes,\r\nand we fished for them with long willow branches. The island grew\r\nperceptibly smaller as the banks were torn away with great gulps and\r\nsplashes. The weather kept brilliantly fine till about four o'clock, and\r\nthen for the first time for three days the wind showed signs of abating.\r\nClouds began to gather in the southwest, spreading thence slowly over\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nThis lessening of the wind came as a great relief, for the incessant\r\nroaring, banging, and thundering had irritated our nerves. Yet the\r\nsilence that came about five o'clock with its sudden cessation was in a\r\nmanner quite as oppressive. The booming of the river had everything its\r\nown way then: it filled the air with deep murmurs, more musical than the\r\nwind noises, but infinitely more monotonous. The wind held many notes,\r\nrising, falling, always beating out some sort of great elemental tune;\r\nwhereas the river's song lay between three notes at most--dull pedal\r\nnotes, that held a lugubrious quality foreign to the wind, and somehow\r\nseemed to me, in my then nervous state, to sound wonderfully well the\r\nmusic of doom.\r\n\r\nIt was extraordinary, too, how the withdrawal suddenly of bright\r\nsunlight took everything out of the landscape that made for\r\ncheerfulness; and since this particular landscape had already managed to\r\nconvey the suggestion of something sinister, the change of course was\r\nall the more unwelcome and noticeable. For me, I know, the darkening\r\noutlook became distinctly more alarming, and I found myself more than\r\nonce calculating how soon after sunset the full moon would get up in the\r\neast, and whether the gathering clouds would greatly interfere with her\r\nlighting of the little island.\r\n\r\nWith this general hush of the wind--though it still indulged in\r\noccasional brief gusts--the river seemed to me to grow blacker, the\r\nwillows to stand more densely together. The latter, too, kept up a sort\r\nof independent movement of their own, rustling among themselves when no\r\nwind stirred, and shaking oddly from the roots upwards. When common\r\nobjects in this way become charged with the suggestion of horror, they\r\nstimulate the imagination far more than things of unusual appearance;\r\nand these bushes, crowding huddled about us, assumed for me in the\r\ndarkness a bizarre _grotesquerie_ of appearance that lent to them\r\nsomehow the aspect of purposeful and living creatures. Their very\r\nordinariness, I felt, masked what was malignant and hostile to us. The\r\nforces of the region drew nearer with the coming of night. They were\r\nfocusing upon our island, and more particularly upon ourselves. For\r\nthus, somehow, in the terms of the imagination, did my really\r\nindescribable sensations in this extraordinary place present themselves.\r\n\r\nI had slept a good deal in the early afternoon, and had thus recovered\r\nsomewhat from the exhaustion of a disturbed night, but this only served\r\napparently to render me more susceptible than before to the obsessing\r\nspell of the haunting. I fought against it, laughing at my feelings as\r\nabsurd and childish, with very obvious physiological explanations, yet,\r\nin spite of every effort, they gained in strength upon me so that I\r\ndreaded the night as a child lost in a forest must dread the approach of\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe canoe we had carefully covered with a waterproof sheet during the\r\nday, and the one remaining paddle had been securely tied by the Swede to\r\nthe base of a tree, lest the wind should rob us of that too. From five\r\no'clock onwards I busied myself with the stew-pot and preparations for\r\ndinner, it being my turn to cook that night. We had potatoes, onions,\r\nbits of bacon fat to add flavour, and a general thick residue from\r\nformer stews at the bottom of the pot; with black bread broken up into\r\nit the result was most excellent, and it was followed by a stew of plums\r\nwith sugar and a brew of strong tea with dried milk. A good pile of wood\r\nlay close at hand, and the absence of wind made my duties easy. My\r\ncompanion sat lazily watching me, dividing his attentions between\r\ncleaning his pipe and giving useless advice--an admitted privilege of\r\nthe off-duty man. He had been very quiet all the afternoon, engaged in\r\nre-caulking the canoe, strengthening the tent ropes, and fishing for\r\ndriftwood while I slept. No more talk about undesirable things had\r\npassed between us, and I think his only remarks had to do with the\r\ngradual destruction of the island, which he declared was now fully a\r\nthird smaller than when we first landed.\r\n\r\nThe pot had just begun to bubble when I heard his voice calling to me\r\nfrom the bank, where he had wandered away without my noticing. I ran up.\r\n\r\n\"Come and listen,\" he said, \"and see what you make of it.\" He held his\r\nhand cupwise to his ear, as so often before.\r\n\r\n\"_Now_ do you hear anything?\" he asked, watching me curiously.\r\n\r\nWe stood there, listening attentively together. At first I heard only\r\nthe deep note of the water and the hissings rising from its turbulent\r\nsurface. The willows, for once, were motionless and silent. Then a sound\r\nbegan to reach my ears faintly, a peculiar sound--something like the\r\nhumming of a distant gong. It seemed to come across to us in the\r\ndarkness from the waste of swamps and willows opposite. It was repeated\r\nat regular intervals, but it was certainly neither the sound of a bell\r\nnor the hooting of a distant steamer. I can liken it to nothing so much\r\nas to the sound of an immense gong, suspended far up in the sky,\r\nrepeating incessantly its muffled metallic note, soft and musical, as\r\nit was repeatedly struck. My heart quickened as I listened.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard it all day,\" said my companion. \"While you slept this\r\nafternoon it came all round the island. I hunted it down, but could\r\nnever get near enough to see--to localize it correctly. Sometimes it was\r\noverhead, and sometimes it seemed under the water. Once or twice, too, I\r\ncould have sworn it was not outside at all, but _within myself_--you\r\nknow--the way a sound in the fourth dimension is supposed to come.\"\r\n\r\nI was too much puzzled to pay much attention to his words. I listened\r\ncarefully, striving to associate it with any known familiar sound I\r\ncould think of, but without success. It changed in direction, too,\r\ncoming nearer, and then sinking utterly away into remote distance. I\r\ncannot say that it was ominous in quality, because to me it seemed\r\ndistinctly musical, yet I must admit it set going a distressing feeling\r\nthat made me wish I had never heard it.\r\n\r\n\"The wind blowing in those sand-funnels,\" I said, determined to find an\r\nexplanation, \"or the bushes rubbing together after the storm perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"It comes off the whole swamp,\" my friend answered. \"It comes from\r\neverywhere at once.\" He ignored my explanations. \"It comes from the\r\nwillow bushes somehow----\"\r\n\r\n\"But now the wind has dropped,\" I objected \"The willows can hardly make\r\na noise by themselves, can they?\"\r\n\r\nHis answer frightened me, first because I had dreaded it, and secondly,\r\nbecause I knew intuitively it was true.\r\n\r\n\"It is _because_ the wind has dropped we now hear it. It was drowned\r\nbefore. It is the cry, I believe of the----\"\r\n\r\nI dashed back to my fire, warned by a sound of bubbling that the stew\r\nwas in danger, but determined at the same time to escape from further\r\nconversation. I was resolute, if possible, to avoid the exchanging of\r\nviews. I dreaded, too, that he would begin again about the gods, or the\r\nelemental forces, or something else disquieting, and I wanted to keep\r\nmyself well in hand for what might happen later. There was another night\r\nto be faced before we escaped from this distressing place, and there was\r\nno knowing yet what it might bring forth.\r\n\r\n\"Come and cut up bread for the pot,\" I called to him, vigorously\r\nstirring the appetizing mixture. That stew-pot held sanity for us both,\r\nand the thought made me laugh.\r\n\r\nHe came over slowly and took the provision sack from the tree, fumbling\r\nin its mysterious depths, and then emptying the entire contents upon the\r\nground-sheet at his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up!\" I cried; \"it's boiling.\"\r\n\r\nThe Swede burst out into a roar of laughter that startled me. It was\r\nforced laughter, not artificial exactly, but mirthless.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing here!\" he shouted, holding his sides.\r\n\r\n\"Bread, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's gone. There is no bread. They've taken it!\"\r\n\r\nI dropped the long spoon and ran up. Everything the sack had contained\r\nlay upon the ground-sheet, but there was no loaf.\r\n\r\nThe whole dead weight of my growing fear fell upon me and shook me. Then\r\nI burst out laughing too. It was the only thing to do: and the sound of\r\nmy own laughter also made me understand his. The strain of psychical\r\npressure caused it--this explosion of unnatural laughter in both of us;\r\nit was an effort of repressed forces to seek relief; it was a temporary\r\nsafety valve. And with both of us it ceased quite suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"How criminally stupid of me!\" I cried, still determined to be\r\nconsistent and find an explanation. \"I clean forgot to buy a loaf at\r\nPressburg. That chattering woman put everything out of my head, and I\r\nmust have left it lying on the counter or----\"\r\n\r\n\"The oatmeal, too, is much less than it was this morning,\" the Swede\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nWhy in the world need he draw attention to it? I thought angrily.\r\n\r\n\"There's enough for to-morrow,\" I said, stirring vigorously, \"and we can\r\nget lots more at Komorn or Gran. In twenty-four hours we shall be miles\r\nfrom here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so--to God,\" he muttered, putting the things back into the sack,\r\n\"unless we're claimed first as victims for the sacrifice,\" he added\r\nwith a foolish laugh. He dragged the sack into the tent, for safety's\r\nsake, I suppose, and I heard him mumbling on to himself, but so\r\nindistinctly that it seemed quite natural for me to ignore his words.\r\n\r\nOur meal was beyond question a gloomy one, and we ate it almost in\r\nsilence, avoiding one another's eyes, and keeping the fire bright. Then\r\nwe washed up and prepared for the night, and, once smoking, our minds\r\nunoccupied with any definite duties, the apprehension I had felt all day\r\nlong became more and more acute. It was not then active fear, I think,\r\nbut the very vagueness of its origin distressed me far more than if I\r\nhad been able to ticket and face it squarely. The curious sound I have\r\nlikened to the note of a gong became now almost incessant, and filled\r\nthe stillness of the night with a faint, continuous ringing rather than\r\na series of distinct notes. At one time it was behind and at another\r\ntime in front of us. Sometimes I fancied it came from the bushes on our\r\nleft, and then again from the clumps on our right. More often it hovered\r\ndirectly overhead like the whirring of wings. It was really everywhere\r\nat once, behind, in front, at our sides and over our heads, completely\r\nsurrounding us. The sound really defies description. But nothing within\r\nmy knowledge is like that ceaseless muffled humming rising off the\r\ndeserted world of swamps and willows.\r\n\r\nWe sat smoking in comparative silence, the strain growing every minute\r\ngreater. The worst feature of the situation seemed to me that we did not\r\nknow what to expect, and could therefore make no sort of preparation by\r\nway of defense. We could anticipate nothing. My explanations made in the\r\nsunshine, moreover, now came to haunt me with their foolish and wholly\r\nunsatisfactory nature, and it was more and more clear to me that some\r\nkind of plain talk with my companion was inevitable, whether I liked it\r\nor not. After all, we had to spend the night together, and to sleep in\r\nthe same tent side by side. I saw that I could not get along much longer\r\nwithout the support of his mind, and for that, of course, plain talk was\r\nimperative. As long as possible, however, I postponed this little\r\nclimax, and tried to ignore or laugh at the occasional sentences he\r\nflung into the emptiness.\r\n\r\nSome of these sentences, moreover, were confoundedly disquieting to me,\r\ncoming as they did to corroborate much that I felt myself:\r\ncorroboration, too--which made it so much more convincing--from a\r\ntotally different point of view. He composed such curious sentences, and\r\nhurled them at me in such an inconsequential sort of way, as though his\r\nmain line of thought was secret to himself, and these fragments were the\r\nbits he found it impossible to digest. He got rid of them by uttering\r\nthem. Speech relieved him. It was like being sick.\r\n\r\n\"There are things about us, I'm sure, that make for disorder,\r\ndisintegration, destruction, _our_ destruction,\" he said once, while the\r\nfire blazed between us. \"We've strayed out of a safe line somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nAnd another time, when the gong sounds had come nearer, ringing much\r\nlouder than before, and directly over our heads, he said, as though\r\ntalking to himself:\r\n\r\n\"I don't think a phonograph would show any record of that. The sound\r\ndoesn't come to me by the ears at all. The vibrations reach me in\r\nanother manner altogether, and seem to be within me, which is precisely\r\nhow a fourth dimension sound might be supposed to make itself heard.\"\r\n\r\nI purposely made no reply to this, but I sat up a little closer to the\r\nfire and peered about me into the darkness. The clouds were massed all\r\nover the sky and no trace of moonlight came through. Very still, too,\r\neverything was, so that the river and the frogs had things all their own\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"It has that about it,\" he went on, \"which is utterly out of common\r\nexperience. It is _unknown_. Only one thing describes it really: it is a\r\nnon-human sound; I mean a sound outside humanity.\"\r\n\r\nHaving rid himself of this indigestible morsel, he lay quiet for a time;\r\nbut he had so admirably expressed my own feeling that it was a relief to\r\nhave the thought out, and to have confined it by the limitation of words\r\nfrom dangerous wandering to and fro in the mind.\r\n\r\nThe solitude of that Danube camping-place, can I ever forget it? The\r\nfeeling of being utterly alone on an empty planet! My thoughts ran\r\nincessantly upon cities and the haunts of men. I would have given my\r\nsoul, as the saying is, for the \"feel\" of those Bavarian villages we had\r\npassed through by the score; for the normal, human commonplaces,\r\npeasants drinking beer, tables beneath the trees, hot sunshine, and a\r\nruined castle on the rocks behind the red-roofed church. Even the\r\ntourists would have been welcome.\r\n\r\nYet what I felt of dread was no ordinary ghostly fear. It was infinitely\r\ngreater, stranger, and seemed to arise from some dim ancestral sense of\r\nterror more profoundly disturbing than anything I had known or dreamed\r\nof. We had \"strayed,\" as the Swede put it, into some region or some set\r\nof conditions where the risks were great, yet unintelligible to us;\r\nwhere the frontiers of some unknown world lay close about us. It was a\r\nspot held by the dwellers in some outer space, a sort of peephole whence\r\nthey could spy upon the earth, themselves unseen, a point where the veil\r\nbetween had worn a little thin. As the final result of too long a\r\nsojourn here, we should be carried over the border and deprived of what\r\nwe called \"our lives,\" yet by mental, not physical, processes. In that\r\nsense, as he said, we should be the victims of our adventure--a\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt took us in different fashion, each according to the measure of his\r\nsensitiveness and powers of resistance. I translated it vaguely into a\r\npersonification of the mightily disturbed elements, investing them with\r\nthe horror of a deliberate and malefic purpose, resentful of our\r\naudacious intrusion into their breeding-place; whereas my friend threw\r\nit into the unoriginal form at first of a trespass on some ancient\r\nshrine, some place where the old gods still held sway, where the\r\nemotional forces of former worshipers still clung, and the ancestral\r\nportion of him yielded to the old pagan spell.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, here was a place unpolluted by men, kept clean by the winds\r\nfrom coarsening human influences, a place where spiritual agencies were\r\nwithin reach and aggressive. Never, before or since, have I been so\r\nattacked by indescribable suggestions of a \"beyond region,\" of another\r\nscheme of life, another evolution not parallel to the human. And in the\r\nend our minds would succumb under the weight of the awful spell, and we\r\nshould be drawn across the frontier into _their_ world.\r\n\r\nSmall things testified to this amazing influence of the place, and now\r\nin the silence round the fire they allowed themselves to be noted by the\r\nmind. The very atmosphere had proved itself a magnifying medium to\r\ndistort every indication: the otter rolling in the current, the hurrying\r\nboatman making signs, the shifting willows, one and all had been robbed\r\nof its natural character, and revealed in something of its other\r\naspect--as it existed across the border in that other region. And this\r\nchanged aspect I felt was new not merely to me, but to the race. The\r\nwhole experience whose verge we touched was unknown to humanity at all.\r\nIt was a new order of experience, and in the true sense of the word\r\n_unearthly_.\r\n\r\n\"It's the deliberate, calculating purpose that reduces one's courage to\r\nzero,\" the Swede said suddenly, as if he had been actually following my\r\nthoughts. \"Otherwise imagination might count for much. But the paddle,\r\nthe canoe, the lessening food----\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I explained all that once?\" I interrupted viciously.\r\n\r\n\"You have,\" he answered dryly; \"you have indeed.\"\r\n\r\nHe made other remarks too, as usual, about what he called the \"plain\r\ndetermination to provide a victim\"; but, having now arranged my thoughts\r\nbetter, I recognized that this was simply the cry of his frightened soul\r\nagainst the knowledge that he was being attacked in a vital part, and\r\nthat he would be somehow taken or destroyed. The situation called for a\r\ncourage and calmness of reasoning that neither of us could compass, and\r\nI have never before been so clearly conscious of two persons in me--the\r\none that explained everything, and the other that laughed at such\r\nfoolish explanations, yet was horribly afraid.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the pitchy night the fire died down and the woodpile grew\r\nsmall. Neither of us moved to replenish the stock, and the darkness\r\nconsequently came up very close to our faces. A few feet beyond the\r\ncircle of firelight it was inky black. Occasionally a stray puff of wind\r\nset the billows shivering about us, but apart from this not very welcome\r\nsound a deep and depressing silence reigned, broken only by the gurgling\r\nof the river and the humming in the air overhead.\r\n\r\nWe both missed, I think, the shouting company of the winds.\r\n\r\nAt length, at a moment when a stray puff prolonged itself as though the\r\nwind were about to rise again, I reached the point for me of saturation,\r\nthe point where it was absolutely necessary to find relief in plain\r\nspeech, or else to betray myself by some hysterical extravagance that\r\nmust have been far worse in its effect upon both of us. I kicked the\r\nfire into a blaze, and turned to my companion abruptly. He looked up\r\nwith a start.\r\n\r\n\"I can't disguise it any longer,\" I said; \"I don't like this place, and\r\nthe darkness, and the noises, and the awful feelings I get. There's\r\nsomething here that beats me utterly. I'm in a blue funk, and that's the\r\nplain truth. If the other shore was--different, I swear I'd be inclined\r\nto swim for it!\"\r\n\r\nThe Swede's face turned very white beneath the deep tan of sun and wind.\r\nHe stared straight at me and answered quietly, but his voice betrayed\r\nhis huge excitement by its unnatural calmness. For the moment, at any\r\nrate, he was the strong man of the two. He was more phlegmatic, for one\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a physical condition we can escape from by running away,\" he\r\nreplied, in the tone of a doctor diagnosing some grave disease; \"we must\r\nsit tight and wait. There are forces close here that could kill a herd\r\nof elephants in a second as easily as you or I could squash a fly. Our\r\nonly chance is to keep perfectly still. Our insignificance perhaps may\r\nsave us.\"\r\n\r\nI put a dozen questions into my expression of face, but found no words.\r\nIt was precisely like listening to an accurate description of a disease\r\nwhose symptoms had puzzled me.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that so far, although aware of our disturbing presence, they\r\nhave not _found_ us--not 'located' us, as the Americans say,\" he went\r\non. \"They're blundering about like men hunting for a leak of gas. The\r\npaddle and canoe and provisions prove that. I think they _feel_ us, but\r\ncannot actually see us. We must keep our minds quiet--it's our minds\r\nthey feel. We must control our thoughts, or it's all up with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Death you mean?\" I stammered, icy with the horror of his suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Worse--by far,\" he said. \"Death, according to one's belief, means\r\neither annihilation or release from the limitations of the senses, but\r\nit involves no change of character. _You_ don't suddenly alter just\r\nbecause the body's gone. But this means a radical alteration, a complete\r\nchange, a horrible loss of oneself by substitution--far worse than\r\ndeath, and not even annihilation. We happen to have camped in a spot\r\nwhere their region touches ours where the veil between has worn\r\nthin\"--horrors! he was using my very own phrase, my actual words--\"so\r\nthat they are aware of our being in their neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _who_ are aware?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nI forgot the shaking of the willows in the windless calm, the humming\r\noverhead, everything except that I was waiting for an answer that I\r\ndreaded more than I can possibly explain.\r\n\r\nHe lowered his voice at once to reply, leaning forward a little over the\r\nfire, an indefinable change in his face that made me avoid his eyes and\r\nlook down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"All my life,\" he said, \"I have been strangely, vividly conscious of\r\nanother region--not far removed from our own world in one sense, yet\r\nwholly different in kind--where great things go on unceasingly, where\r\nimmense and terrible personalities hurry by, intent on vast purposes\r\ncompared to which earthly affairs, the rise and fall of nations, the\r\ndestinies of empires, the fate of armies and continents, are all as dust\r\nin the balance; vast purposes, I mean, that deal directly with the soul,\r\nand not indirectly with mere expressions of the soul--\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggest just now--\" I began, seeking to stop him, feeling as though I\r\nwas face to face with a madman. But he instantly overbore me with his\r\ntorrent that _had_ to come.\r\n\r\n\"You think,\" he said, \"it is the spirits of the elements, and I thought\r\nperhaps it was the old gods. But I tell you now it is--_neither_. These\r\nwould be comprehensible entities, for they have relations with men,\r\ndepending upon them for worship or sacrifice, whereas these beings who\r\nare now about us have absolutely nothing to do with mankind, and it is\r\nmere chance that their space happens just at this spot to touch our\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nThe mere conception, which his words somehow made so convincing, as I\r\nlistened to them there in the dark stillness of that lonely island, set\r\nme shaking a little all over. I found it impossible to control my\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you propose?\" I began again.\r\n\r\n\"A sacrifice, a victim, might save us by distracting them until we could\r\nget away,\" he went on, \"just as the wolves stop to devour the dogs and\r\ngive the sleigh another start. But--I see no chance of any other victim\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nI stared blankly at him. The gleam in his eyes was dreadful. Presently\r\nhe continued.\r\n\r\n\"It's the willows, of course. The willows _mask_ the others, but the\r\nothers are feeling about for us. If we let our minds betray our fear,\r\nwe're lost, lost utterly.\" He looked at me with an expression so calm,\r\nso determined, so sincere, that I no longer had any doubts as to his\r\nsanity. He was as sane as any man ever was. \"If we can hold out through\r\nthe night,\" he added, \"we may get off in the daylight unnoticed, or\r\nrather, _undiscovered_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you really think a sacrifice would----\"\r\n\r\nThat gong-like humming came down very close over our heads as I spoke,\r\nbut it was my friend's scared face that really stopped my mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" he whispered, holding up his hand. \"Do not mention them more\r\nthan you can help. Do not refer to them _by name_. To name is to reveal:\r\nit is the inevitable clue, and our only hope lies in ignoring them, in\r\norder that they may ignore us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even in thought?\" He was extraordinarily agitated.\r\n\r\n\"Especially in thought. Our thoughts make spirals in their world. We\r\nmust keep them _out of our minds_ at all costs if possible.\"\r\n\r\nI raked the fire together to prevent the darkness having everything its\r\nown way. I never longed for the sun as I longed for it then in the awful\r\nblackness of that summer night.\r\n\r\n\"Were you awake all last night?\" he went on suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I slept badly a little after dawn,\" I replied evasively, trying to\r\nfollow his instructions, which I knew instinctively were true, \"but the\r\nwind, of course--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. But the wind won't account for all the noises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you heard it too?\"\r\n\r\n\"The multiplying countless little footsteps I heard,\" he said, adding,\r\nafter a moment's hesitation, \"and that other sound--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean above the tent, and the pressing down upon us of something\r\ntremendous, gigantic?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded significantly.\r\n\r\n\"It was like the beginning of a sort of inner suffocation?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Partly, yes. It seemed to me that the weight of the atmosphere had been\r\naltered--had increased enormously, so that we should be crushed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And _that_,\" I went on, determined to have it all out, pointing upwards\r\nwhere the gong-like note hummed ceaselessly, rising and falling like\r\nwind. \"What do you make of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's _their_ sound,\" he whispered gravely. \"It's the sound of their\r\nworld, the humming in their region. The division here is so thin that it\r\nleaks through somehow. But, if you listen carefully, you'll find it's\r\nnot above so much as around us. It's in the willows. It's the willows\r\nthemselves humming, because here the willows have been made symbols of\r\nthe forces that are against us.\"\r\n\r\nI could not follow exactly what he meant by this, yet the thought and\r\nidea in my mind were beyond question the thought and idea in his. I\r\nrealized what he realized, only with less power of analysis than his. It\r\nwas on the tip of my tongue to tell him at last about my hallucination\r\nof the ascending figures and the moving bushes, when he suddenly thrust\r\nhis face again close into mine across the firelight and began to speak\r\nin a very earnest whisper. He amazed me by his calmness and pluck, his\r\napparent control of the situation. This man I had for years deemed\r\nunimaginative, stolid!\r\n\r\n\"Now listen,\" he said. \"The only thing for us to do is to go on as\r\nthough nothing had happened, follow our usual habits, go to bed, and so\r\nforth; pretend we feel nothing and notice nothing. It is a question\r\nwholly of the mind, and the less we think about them the better our\r\nchance of escape. Above all, don't _think_, for what you think happens!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I managed to reply, simply breathless with his words and\r\nthe strangeness of it all; \"all right, I'll try, but tell me one thing\r\nmore first. Tell me what you make of those hollows in the ground all\r\nabout us, those sand-funnels?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he cried, forgetting to whisper in his excitement. \"I dare not,\r\nsimply dare not, put the thought into words. If you have not guessed I\r\nam glad. Don't try to. _They_ have put it into my mind; try your hardest\r\nto prevent their putting it into yours.\"\r\n\r\nHe sank his voice again to a whisper before he finished, and I did not\r\npress him to explain. There was already just about as much horror in me\r\nas I could hold. The conversation came to an end, and we smoked our\r\npipes busily in silence.\r\n\r\nThen something happened, something unimportant apparently, as the way is\r\nwhen the nerves are in a very great state of tension, and this small\r\nthing for a brief space gave me an entirely different point of view. I\r\nchanced to look down at my sand-shoe--the sort we used for the\r\ncanoe--and something to do with the hole at the toe suddenly recalled\r\nto me the London shop where I had bought them, the difficulty the man\r\nhad in fitting me, and other details of the uninteresting but practical\r\noperation. At once, in its train, followed a wholesome view of the\r\nmodern skeptical world I was accustomed to move in at home. I thought of\r\nroast beef and ale, motor-cars, policemen, brass bands, and a dozen\r\nother things that proclaimed the soul of ordinariness or utility. The\r\neffect was immediate and astonishing even to myself. Psychologically, I\r\nsuppose, it was simply a sudden and violent reaction after the strain of\r\nliving in an atmosphere of things that to the normal consciousness must\r\nseem impossible and incredible. But, whatever the cause, it momentarily\r\nlifted the spell from my heart, and left me for the short space of a\r\nminute feeling free and utterly unafraid. I looked up at my friend\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\"You damned old pagan!\" I cried, laughing aloud in his face. \"You\r\nimaginative idiot! You superstitious idolator! You----\"\r\n\r\nI stopped in the middle, seized anew by the old horror. I tried to\r\nsmother the sound of my voice as something sacrilegious. The Swede, of\r\ncourse, heard it too--that strange cry overhead in the darkness--and\r\nthat sudden drop in the air as though something had come nearer.\r\n\r\nHe had turned ashen white under the tan. He stood bolt upright in front\r\nof the fire, stiff as a rod, staring at me.\r\n\r\n\"After that,\" he said in a sort of helpless, frantic way, \"we must go!\r\nWe can't stay now; we must strike camp this very instant and go on--down\r\nthe river.\"\r\n\r\nHe was talking, I saw, quite wildly, his words dictated by abject\r\nterror--the terror he had resisted so long, but which had caught him at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"In the dark?\" I exclaimed, shaking with fear after my hysterical\r\noutburst, but still realizing our position better than he did. \"Sheer\r\nmadness! The river's in flood, and we've only got a single paddle.\r\nBesides, we only go deeper into their country! There's nothing ahead for\r\nfifty miles but willows, willows, willows!\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down again in a state of semi-collapse. The positions, by one of\r\nthose kaleidoscopic changes nature loves, were suddenly reversed, and\r\nthe control of our forces passed over into my hands. His mind at last\r\nhad reached the point where it was beginning to weaken.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth possessed you to do such a thing?\" he whispered, with the\r\nawe of genuine terror in his voice and face.\r\n\r\nI crossed round to his side of the fire. I took both his hands in mine,\r\nkneeling down beside him and looking straight into his frightened eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We'll make one more blaze,\" I said firmly, \"and then turn in for the\r\nnight. At sunrise we'll be off full speed for Komorn. Now, pull yourself\r\ntogether a bit, and remember your own advice about _not thinking\r\nfear_!\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more, and I saw that he would agree and obey. In some\r\nmeasure, too, it was a sort of relief to get up and make an excursion\r\ninto the darkness for more wood. We kept close together, almost\r\ntouching, groping among the bushes and along the bank. The humming\r\noverhead never ceased, but seemed to me to grow louder as we increased\r\nour distance from the fire. It was shivery work!\r\n\r\nWe were grubbing away in the middle of a thickish clump of willows where\r\nsome driftwood from a former flood had caught high among the branches,\r\nwhen my body was seized in a grip that made me half drop upon the sand.\r\nIt was the Swede. He had fallen against me, and was clutching me for\r\nsupport. I heard his breath coming and going in short gasps.\r\n\r\n\"Look! By my soul!\" he whispered, and for the first time in my\r\nexperience I knew what it was to hear tears of terror in a human voice.\r\nHe was pointing to the fire, some fifty feet away. I followed the\r\ndirection of his finger, and I swear my heart missed a beat.\r\n\r\nThere, in front of the dim glow, _something was moving_.\r\n\r\nI saw it through a veil that hung before my eyes like the gauze\r\ndrop-curtain used at the back of a theater--hazily a little. It was\r\nneither a human figure nor an animal. To me it gave the strange\r\nimpression of being as large as several animals grouped together, like\r\nhorses, two or three, moving slowly. The Swede, too, got a similar\r\nresult, though expressing it differently, for he thought it was shaped\r\nand sized like a clump of willow bushes, rounded at the top, and moving\r\nall over upon its surface--\"coiling upon itself like smoke,\" he said\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\"I watched it settle downwards through the bushes,\" he sobbed at me.\r\n\"Look, by God! It's coming this way! Oh, oh!\"--he gave a kind of\r\nwhistling cry. \"_They've found us_.\"\r\n\r\nI gave one terrified glance, which just enabled me to see that the\r\nshadowy form was swinging towards us through the bushes, and then I\r\ncollapsed backwards with a crash into the branches. These failed, of\r\ncourse, to support my weight, so that with the Swede on the top of me we\r\nfell in a struggling heap upon the sand. I really hardly knew what was\r\nhappening. I was conscious only of a sort of enveloping sensation of icy\r\nfear that plucked the nerves out of their fleshly covering, twisted them\r\nthis way and that, and replaced them quivering. My eyes were tightly\r\nshut; something in my throat choked me; a feeling that my consciousness\r\nwas expanding, extending out into space, swiftly gave way to another\r\nfeeling that I was losing it altogether, and about to die.\r\n\r\nAn acute spasm of pain passed through me, and I was aware that the Swede\r\nhad hold of me in such a way that he hurt me abominably. It was the way\r\nhe caught at me in falling.\r\n\r\nBut it was this pain, he declared afterwards, that saved me: it caused\r\nme to _forget them_ and think of something else at the very instant when\r\nthey were about to find me. It concealed my mind from them at the moment\r\nof discovery, yet just in time to evade their terrible seizing of me. He\r\nhimself, he says, actually swooned at the same moment, and that was what\r\nsaved him.\r\n\r\nI only know that at a later time, how long or short is impossible to\r\nsay, I found myself scrambling up out of the slippery network of willow\r\nbranches, and saw my companion standing in front of me holding out a\r\nhand to assist me. I stared at him in a dazed way, rubbing the arm he\r\nhad twisted for me. Nothing came to me to say, somehow.\r\n\r\n\"I lost consciousness for a moment or two,\" I heard him say. \"That's\r\nwhat saved me. It made me stop thinking about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You nearly broke my arm in two,\" I said, uttering my only connected\r\nthought at the moment. A numbness came over me.\r\n\r\n\"That's what saved _you_!\" he replied. \"Between us, we've managed to set\r\nthem off on a false tack somewhere. The humming has ceased. It's\r\ngone--for the moment at any rate!\"\r\n\r\nA wave of hysterical laughter seized me again, and this time spread to\r\nmy friend too--great healing gusts of shaking laughter that brought a\r\ntremendous sense of relief in their train. We made our way back to the\r\nfire and put the wood on so that it blazed at once. Then we saw that the\r\ntent had fallen over and lay in a tangled heap upon the ground.\r\n\r\nWe picked it up, and during the process tripped more than once and\r\ncaught our feet in sand.\r\n\r\n\"It's those sand-funnels,\" exclaimed the Swede, when the tent was up\r\nagain and the firelight lit up the ground for several yards about us.\r\n\"And look at the size of them!\"\r\n\r\nAll round the tent and about the fireplace where we had seen the moving\r\nshadows there were deep funnel-shaped hollows in the sand, exactly\r\nsimilar to the ones we had already found over the island, only far\r\nbigger and deeper, beautifully formed, and wide enough in some instances\r\nto admit the whole of my foot and leg.\r\n\r\nNeither of us said a word. We both knew that sleep was the safest thing\r\nwe could do, and to bed we went accordingly without further delay,\r\nhaving first thrown sand on the fire and taken the provision sack and\r\nthe paddle inside the tent with us. The canoe, too, we propped in such a\r\nway at the end of the tent that our feet touched it, and the least\r\nmotion would disturb and wake us.\r\n\r\nIn case of emergency, too, we again went to bed in our clothes, ready\r\nfor a sudden start.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt was my firm intention to lie awake all night and watch, but the\r\nexhaustion of nerves and body decreed otherwise, and sleep after a while\r\ncame over me with a welcome blanket of oblivion. The fact that my\r\ncompanion also slept quickened its approach. At first he fidgeted and\r\nconstantly sat up, asking me if I \"heard this\" or \"heard that.\" He\r\ntossed about on his cork mattress, and said the tent was moving and the\r\nriver had risen over the point of the island; but each time I went out\r\nto look I returned with the report that all was well, and finally he\r\ngrew calmer and lay still. Then at length his breathing became regular\r\nand I heard unmistakable sounds of snoring--the first and only time in\r\nmy life when snoring has been a welcome and calming influence.\r\n\r\nThis, I remember, was the last thought in my mind before dozing off.\r\n\r\nA difficulty in breathing woke me, and I found the blanket over my face.\r\nBut something else besides the blanket was pressing upon me, and my\r\nfirst thought was that my companion had rolled off his mattress on to my\r\nown in his sleep. I called to him and sat up, and at the same moment it\r\ncame to me that the tent was _surrounded_. That sound of multitudinous\r\nsoft pattering was again audible outside, filling the night with horror.\r\n\r\nI called again to him, louder than before. He did not answer, but I\r\nmissed the sound of his snoring, and also noticed that the flap of the\r\ntent door was down. This was the unpardonable sin. I crawled out in the\r\ndarkness to hook it back securely, and it was then for the first time I\r\nrealized positively that the Swede was not there. He had gone.\r\n\r\nI dashed out in a mad run, seized by a dreadful agitation, and the\r\nmoment I was out I plunged into a sort of torrent of humming that\r\nsurrounded me completely and came out of every quarter of the heavens at\r\nonce. It was that same familiar humming--gone mad! A swarm of great\r\ninvisible bees might have been about me in the air. The sound seemed to\r\nthicken the very atmosphere, and I felt that my lungs worked with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nBut my friend was in danger, and I could not hesitate.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was just about to break, and a faint whitish light spread\r\nupwards over the clouds from a thin strip of clear horizon. No wind\r\nstirred. I could just make out the bushes and river beyond, and the pale\r\nsandy patches. In my excitement I ran frantically to and fro about the\r\nisland, calling him by name, shouting at the top of my voice the first\r\nwords that came into my head. But the willows smothered my voice, and\r\nthe humming muffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet round\r\nme. I plunged among the bushes, tripping headlong, tumbling over roots,\r\nand scraping my face as I tore this way and that among the preventing\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nThen, quite unexpectedly, I came out upon the island's point and saw a\r\ndark figure outlined between the water and the sky. It was the Swede.\r\nAnd already he had one foot in the river! A moment more and he would\r\nhave taken the plunge.\r\n\r\nI threw myself upon him, flinging my arms about his waist and dragging\r\nhim shorewards with all my strength. Of course he struggled furiously,\r\nmaking a noise all the time just like that cursed humming, and using the\r\nmost outlandish phrases in his anger about \"going _inside_ to Them,\" and\r\n\"taking the way of the water and the wind,\" and God only knows what more\r\nbesides, that I tried in vain to recall afterwards, but which turned me\r\nsick with horror and amazement as I listened. But in the end I managed\r\nto get him into the comparative safety of the tent, and flung him\r\nbreathless and cursing upon the mattress, where I held him until the fit\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\nI think the suddenness with which it all went and he grew calm,\r\ncoinciding as it did with the equally abrupt cessation of the humming\r\nand pattering outside--I think this was almost the strangest part of the\r\nwhole business perhaps. For he just opened his eyes and turned his tired\r\nface up to me so that the dawn threw a pale light upon it through the\r\ndoorway, and said, for all the world just like a frightened child:\r\n\r\n\"My life, old man--it's my life I owe you. But it's all over now anyhow.\r\nThey've found a victim in our place!\"\r\n\r\nThen he dropped back upon his blankets and went to sleep literally under\r\nmy eyes. He simply collapsed, and began to snore again as healthily as\r\nthough nothing had happened and he had never tried to offer his own life\r\nas a sacrifice by drowning. And when the sunlight woke him three hours\r\nlater--hours of ceaseless vigil for me--it became so clear to me that he\r\nremembered absolutely nothing of what he had attempted to do, that I\r\ndeemed it wise to hold my peace and ask no dangerous questions.\r\n\r\nHe woke naturally and easily, as I have said, when the sun was already\r\nhigh in a windless hot sky, and he at once got up and set about the\r\npreparation of the fire for breakfast. I followed him anxiously at\r\nbathing, but he did not attempt to plunge in, merely dipping his head\r\nand making some remark about the extra coldness of the water.\r\n\r\n\"River's falling at last,\" he said, \"and I'm glad of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The humming has stopped too,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at me quietly with his normal expression. Evidently he\r\nremembered everything except his own attempt at suicide.\r\n\r\n\"Everything has stopped,\" he said, \"because----\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. But I knew some reference to that remark he had made just\r\nbefore he fainted was in his mind, and I was determined to know it.\r\n\r\n\"Because 'They've found another victim'?\" I said, forcing a little\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" he answered, \"exactly! I feel as positive of it as though--as\r\nthough--I feel quite safe again, I mean,\" he finished.\r\n\r\nHe began to look curiously about him. The sunlight lay in hot patches\r\non the sand. There was no wind. The willows were motionless. He slowly\r\nrose to feet.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he said; \"I think if we look, we shall find it.\"\r\n\r\nHe started off on a run, and I followed him. He kept to the banks,\r\npoking with a stick among the sandy bays and caves and little\r\nback-waters, myself always close on his heels.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed presently, \"ah!\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of his voice somehow brought back to me a vivid sense of the\r\nhorror of the last twenty-four hours, and I hurried up to join him. He\r\nwas pointing with his stick at a large black object that lay half in the\r\nwater and half on the sand. It appeared to be caught by some twisted\r\nwillow roots so that the river could not sweep it away. A few hours\r\nbefore the spot must have been under water.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" he said quietly, \"the victim that made our escape possible!\"\r\n\r\nAnd when I peered across his shoulder I saw that his stick rested on the\r\nbody of a man. He turned it over. It was the corpse of a peasant, and\r\nthe face was hidden in the sand. Clearly the man had been drowned but a\r\nfew hours before, and his body must have been swept down upon our island\r\nsomewhere about the hour of the dawn--_at the very time the fit had\r\npassed_.\r\n\r\n\"We must give it a decent burial, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" I replied. I shuddered a little in spite of myself, for\r\nthere was something about the appearance of that poor drowned man that\r\nturned me cold.\r\n\r\nThe Swede glanced up sharply at me, and began clambering down the bank.\r\nI followed him more leisurely. The current, I noticed, had torn away\r\nmuch of the clothing from the body, so that the neck and part of the\r\nchest lay bare.\r\n\r\nHalfway down the bank my companion suddenly stopped and held up his hand\r\nin warning; but either my foot slipped, or I had gained too much\r\nmomentum to bring myself quickly to a halt, for I bumped into him and\r\nsent him forward with a sort of leap to save himself. We tumbled\r\ntogether on to the hard sand so that our feet splashed into the water.\r\nAnd, before anything could be done, we had collided a little heavily\r\nagainst the corpse.\r\n\r\nThe Swede uttered a sharp cry. And I sprang back as if I had been shot.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we touched the body there arose from its surface the loud\r\nsound of humming--the sound of several hummings--which passed with a\r\nvast commotion as of winged things in the air about us and disappeared\r\nupwards into the sky, growing fainter and fainter till they finally\r\nceased in the distance. It was exactly as though we had disturbed some\r\nliving yet invisible creatures at work.\r\n\r\nMy companion clutched me, and I think I clutched him, but before either\r\nof us had time properly to recover from the unexpected shock, we saw\r\nthat a movement of the current was turning the corpse round so that it\r\nbecame released from the grip of the willow roots. A moment later it had\r\nturned completely over, the dead face uppermost, staring at the sky. It\r\nlay on the edge of the main stream. In another moment it would be swept\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe Swede started to save it, shouting again something I did not catch\r\nabout a \"proper burial\" and then abruptly dropped upon his knees on the\r\nsand and covered his eyes with his hands. I was beside him in an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nI saw what he had seen.\r\n\r\nFor just as the body swung round to the current the face and the exposed\r\nchest turned full towards us, and showed plainly how the skin and flesh\r\nwere indented with small hollows, beautifully formed, and exactly\r\nsimilar in shape and kind to the sand-funnels that we had found all over\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\"Their mark!\" I heard my companion mutter under his breath. \"Their awful\r\nmark!\"\r\n\r\nAnd when I turned my eyes again from his ghastly face to the river, the\r\ncurrent had done its work, and the body had been swept away into\r\nmidstream and was already beyond our reach and almost out of sight,\r\nturning over and over on the waves like an otter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shadows on the Wall\r\n\r\nBY MARY E. WILKINS FREEMAN\r\n\r\n     From _The Wind in the Rose-bush_, by Mary E. Wilkins Freeman.\r\n     Copyright by Harper and Brothers. By permission of the publishers\r\n     and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Henry had words with Edward in the study the night before Edward died,\"\r\nsaid Caroline Glynn.\r\n\r\nShe spoke not with acrimony, but with grave severity. Rebecca Ann Glynn\r\ngasped by way of assent. She sat in a wide flounce of black silk in the\r\ncorner of the sofa, and rolled terrified eyes from her sister Caroline\r\nto her sister Mrs. Stephen Brigham, who had been Emma Glynn, the one\r\nbeauty of the family. The latter was beautiful still, with a large,\r\nsplendid, full-blown beauty, she filled a great rocking-chair with her\r\nsuperb bulk of femininity, and swayed gently back and forth, her black\r\nsilks whispering and her black frills fluttering. Even the shock of\r\ndeath--for her brother Edward lay dead in the house--could not disturb\r\nher outward serenity of demeanor.\r\n\r\nBut even her expression of masterly placidity changed before her sister\r\nCaroline's announcement and her sister Rebecca Ann's gasp of terror and\r\ndistress in response.\r\n\r\n\"I think Henry might have controlled his temper, when poor Edward was so\r\nnear his end,\" she said with an asperity which disturbed slightly the\r\nroseate curves of her beautiful mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he did not _know_,\" murmured Rebecca Ann in a faint tone.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he did not know it,\" said Caroline quickly. She turned on her\r\nsister with a strange, sharp look of suspicion. Then she shrank as if\r\nfrom the other's possible answer.\r\n\r\nRebecca gasped again. The married sister, Mrs. Emma Brigham, was now\r\nsitting up straight in her chair; she had ceased rocking, and was eyeing\r\nthem both intently with a sudden accentuation of family likeness in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" said she impartially to them both. Then she, too,\r\nseemed to shrink before a possible answer. She even laughed an evasive\r\nsort of laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody means anything,\" said Caroline firmly. She rose and crossed the\r\nroom toward the door with grim decisiveness.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Mrs. Brigham.\r\n\r\n\"I have something to see to,\" replied Caroline, and the others at once\r\nknew by her tone that she had some solemn and sad duty to perform in the\r\nchamber of death.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Brigham.\r\n\r\nAfter the door had closed behind Caroline, she turned to Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\"Did Henry have many words with him?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"They were talking very loud,\" replied Rebecca evasively.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham looked at her. She had not resumed rocking. She still sat\r\nup straight, with a slight knitting of intensity on her fair forehead,\r\nbetween the pretty rippling curves of her auburn hair.\r\n\r\n\"Did you--ever hear anything?\" she asked in a low voice with a glance\r\ntoward the door.\r\n\r\n\"I was just across the hall in the south parlor, and that door was open\r\nand this door ajar,\" replied Rebecca with a slight flush.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must have----\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The old story.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose Henry was mad, as he always was, because Edward was living on\r\nhere for nothing, when he had wasted all the money father left him.\"\r\n\r\nRebecca nodded, with a fearful glance at the door.\r\n\r\nWhen Emma spoke again her voice was still more hushed. \"I know how he\r\nfelt,\" said she. \"It must have looked to him as if Edward was living at\r\nhis expense, but he wasn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he wasn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Edward had a right here according to the terms of father's will,\r\nand Henry ought to have remembered it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he ought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he say hard things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty hard, from what I heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard him tell Edward that he had no business here at all, and he\r\nthought he had better go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Edward say?\"\r\n\r\n\"That he would stay here as long as he lived and afterward, too, if he\r\nwas a mind to, and he would like to see Henry get him out; and then----\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he laughed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Henry say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't hear him say anything, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw him when he came out of this room.\"\r\n\r\n\"He looked mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've seen him when he looked so.\"\r\n\r\nEmma nodded. The expression of horror on her face had deepened.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember that time he killed the cat because she had scratched\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Don't!\"\r\n\r\nThen Caroline reentered the room; she went up to the stove, in which a\r\nwood fire was burning--it was a cold, gloomy day of fall--and she warmed\r\nher hands, which were reddened from recent washing in cold water.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham looked at her and hesitated. She glanced at the door, which\r\nwas still ajar; it did not easily shut, being still swollen with the\r\ndamp weather of the summer. She rose and pushed it together with a sharp\r\nthud, which jarred the house. Rebecca started painfully with a\r\nhalf-exclamation. Caroline looked at her disapprovingly.\r\n\r\n\"It is time you controlled your nerves, Rebecca,\" she said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham, returning from the closed door, said imperiously that it\r\nought to be fixed, it shut so hard.\r\n\r\n\"It will shrink enough after we have had the fire a few days,\" replied\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\n\"I think Henry ought to be ashamed of himself for talking as he did to\r\nEdward,\" said Mrs. Brigham abruptly, but in an almost inaudible voice.\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" said Caroline, with a glance of actual fear at the closed door.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody can hear with the door shut. I say again I think Henry ought to\r\nbe ashamed of himself. I shouldn't think he'd ever get over it, having\r\nwords with poor Edward the very night before he died. Edward was enough\r\nsight better disposition than Henry, with all his faults.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard him speak a cross word, unless he spoke cross to Henry\r\nthat last night. I don't know but he did from what Rebecca overheard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much cross, as sort of soft, and sweet, and aggravating,\"\r\nsniffed Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\"What do you really think ailed Edward?\" asked Emma in hardly more than\r\na whisper. She did not look at her sister.\r\n\r\n\"I know you said that he had terrible pains in his stomach, and had\r\nspasms, but what do you think made him have them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Henry called it gastric trouble. You know Edward has always had\r\ndyspepsia.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham hesitated a moment. \"Was there any talk of\r\nan--examination?\" said she.\r\n\r\nThen Caroline turned on her fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she in a terrible voice. \"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe three sisters' souls seemed to meet on one common ground of\r\nterrified understanding through their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned latch of the door was heard to rattle, and a push from\r\nwithout made the door shake ineffectually. \"It's Henry,\" Rebecca sighed\r\nrather than whispered. Mrs. Brigham settled herself, after a noiseless\r\nrush across the floor, into her rocking-chair again, and was swaying\r\nback and forth with her head comfortably leaning back, when the door at\r\nlast yielded and Henry Glynn entered. He cast a covertly sharp,\r\ncomprehensive glance at Mrs. Brigham with her elaborate calm; at Rebecca\r\nquietly huddled in the corner of the sofa with her handkerchief to her\r\nface and only one small uncovered reddened ear as attentive as a dog's,\r\nand at Caroline sitting with a strained composure in her armchair by the\r\nstove. She met his eyes quite firmly with a look of inscrutable fear,\r\nand defiance of the fear and of him.\r\n\r\nHenry Glynn looked more like this sister than the others. Both had the\r\nsame hard delicacy of form and aquilinity of feature. They confronted\r\neach other with the pitiless immovability of two statues in whose\r\nmarble lineaments emotions were fixed for all eternity.\r\n\r\nThen Henry Glynn smiled and the smile transformed his face. He looked\r\nsuddenly years younger, and an almost boyish recklessness appeared in\r\nhis face. He flung himself into a chair with a gesture which was\r\nbewildering from its incongruity with his general appearance. He leaned\r\nhis head back, flung one leg over the other, and looked laughingly at\r\nMrs. Brigham.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, Emma, you grow younger every year,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe flushed a little, and her placid mouth widened at the corners. She\r\nwas susceptible to praise.\r\n\r\n\"Our thoughts to-day ought to belong to the one of us who will _never_\r\ngrow older,\" said Caroline in a hard voice.\r\n\r\nHenry looked at her, still smiling. \"Of course, we none of us forget\r\nthat,\" said he, in a deep, gentle voice; \"but we have to speak to the\r\nliving, Caroline, and I have not seen Emma for a long time, and the\r\nliving are as dear as the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to me,\" said Caroline.\r\n\r\nShe rose and went abruptly out of the room again. Rebecca also rose and\r\nhurried after her, sobbing loudly.\r\n\r\nHenry looked slowly after them.\r\n\r\n\"Caroline is completely unstrung,\" said he.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham rocked. A confidence in him inspired by his manner was\r\nstealing over her. Out of that confidence she spoke quite easily and\r\nnaturally.\r\n\r\n\"His death was very sudden,\" said she.\r\n\r\nHenry's eyelids quivered slightly but his gaze was unswerving.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"it was very sudden. He was sick only a few hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gastric.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not think of an examination?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no need. I am perfectly certain as to the cause of his\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mrs. Brigham felt a creep as of some live horror over her very\r\nsoul. Her flesh prickled with cold, before an inflection of his voice.\r\nShe rose, tottering on weak knees.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Henry in a strange, breathless voice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham said something incoherent about some sewing which she had\r\nto do--some black for the funeral--and was out of the room. She went up\r\nto the front chamber which she occupied. Caroline was there. She went\r\nclose to her and took her hands, and the two sisters looked at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak, don't, I won't have it!\" said Caroline finally in an awful\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" replied Emma.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the three sisters were in the study.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham was hemming some black material. At last she laid her work\r\non her lap.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use, I cannot see to sew another stitch until we have a light,\"\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\nCaroline, who was writing some letters at the table, turned to Rebecca,\r\nin her usual place on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\"Rebecca, you had better get a lamp,\" she said.\r\n\r\nRebecca started up; even in the dusk her face showed her agitation.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't seem to me that we need a lamp quite yet,\" she said in a\r\npiteous, pleading voice like a child's.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we do,\" returned Mrs. Brigham peremptorily. \"I can't see to sew\r\nanother stitch.\"\r\n\r\nRebecca rose and left the room. Presently she entered with a lamp. She\r\nset it on the table, an old-fashioned card-table which was placed\r\nagainst the opposite wall from the window. That opposite wall was taken\r\nup with three doors; the one small space was occupied by the table.\r\n\r\n\"What have you put that lamp over there for?\" asked Mrs. Brigham, with\r\nmore of impatience than her voice usually revealed. \"Why didn't you set\r\nit in the hall, and have done with it? Neither Caroline nor I can see if\r\nit is on that table.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought perhaps you would move,\" replied Rebecca hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"If I do move, we can't both sit at that table. Caroline has her paper\r\nall spread around. Why don't you set the lamp on the study table in the\r\nmiddle of the room, then we can both see?\"\r\n\r\nRebecca hesitated. Her face was very pale. She looked with an appeal\r\nthat was fairly agonizing at her sister Caroline.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you put the lamp on this table, as she says?\" asked Caroline,\r\nalmost fiercely. \"Why do you act so, Rebecca?\"\r\n\r\nRebecca took the lamp and set it on the table in the middle of the room\r\nwithout another word. Then she seated herself on the sofa and placed a\r\nhand over her eyes as if to shade them, and remained so.\r\n\r\n\"Does the light hurt your eyes, and is that the reason why you didn't\r\nwant the lamp?\" asked Mrs. Brigham kindly.\r\n\r\n\"I always like to sit in the dark,\" replied Rebecca chokingly. Then she\r\nsnatched her handkerchief hastily from her pocket and began to weep.\r\nCaroline continued to write, Mrs. Brigham to sew.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mrs. Brigham as she sewed glanced at the opposite wall. The\r\nglance became a steady stare. She looked intently, her work suspended in\r\nher hands. Then she looked away again and took a few more stitches, then\r\nshe looked again, and again turned to her task. At last she laid her\r\nwork in her lap and stared concentratedly. She looked from the wall\r\nround the room, taking note of the various objects. Then she turned to\r\nher sisters.\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ that?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Caroline harshly.\r\n\r\n\"That strange shadow on the wall,\" replied Mrs. Brigham.\r\n\r\nRebecca sat with her face hidden; Caroline dipped her pen in the\r\ninkstand.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you turn around and look?\" asked Mrs. Brigham in a wondering\r\nand somewhat aggrieved way.\r\n\r\n\"I am in a hurry to finish this letter,\" replied Caroline shortly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham rose, her work slipping to the floor, and began walking\r\nround the room, moving various articles of furniture, with her eyes on\r\nthe shadow.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly she shrieked out:\r\n\r\n\"Look at this awful shadow! What is it? Caroline, look, look! Rebecca,\r\nlook! What is it?\"\r\n\r\nAll Mrs. Brigham's triumphant placidity was gone. Her handsome face was\r\nlivid with horror. She stood stiffly pointing at the shadow.\r\n\r\nThen after a shuddering glance at the wall Rebecca burst out in a wild\r\nwail.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Caroline, there it is again, there it is again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Caroline Glynn, you look!\" said Mrs. Brigham. \"Look! What is that\r\ndreadful shadow?\"\r\n\r\nCaroline rose, turned, and stood confronting the wall.\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"It has been there every night since he died!\" cried Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\"Every night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he died Thursday and this is Saturday; that makes three nights,\"\r\nsaid Caroline rigidly. She stood as if holding her calm with a vise of\r\nconcentrated will.\r\n\r\n\"It--it looks like--like--\" stammered Mrs. Brigham in a tone of intense\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n\"I know what it looks like well enough,\" said Caroline. \"I've got eyes\r\nin my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks like Edward,\" burst out Rebecca in a sort of frenzy of fear.\r\n\"Only----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it does,\" assented Mrs. Brigham, whose horror-stricken tone\r\nmatched her sisters', \"only--Oh, it is awful! What is it, Caroline?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask you again, how should I know?\" replied Caroline. \"I see it there\r\nlike you. How should I know any more than you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It _must_ be something in the room,\" said Mrs. Brigham, staring wildly\r\naround.\r\n\r\n\"We moved everything in the room the first night it came,\" said Rebecca;\r\n\"it is not anything in the room.\"\r\n\r\nCaroline turned upon her with a sort of fury. \"Of course it is something\r\nin the room,\" said she. \"How you act! What do you mean talking so? Of\r\ncourse it is something in the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" agreed Mrs. Brigham, looking at Caroline\r\nsuspiciously. \"It must be something in the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not anything in the room,\" repeated Rebecca with obstinate\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nThe door opened suddenly and Henry Glynn entered. He began to speak,\r\nthen his eyes followed the direction of the others. He stood staring at\r\nthe shadow on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" he demanded in a strange voice.\r\n\r\n\"It must be due to something in the room,\" Mrs. Brigham said faintly.\r\n\r\nHenry Glynn stood and stared a moment longer. His face showed a gamut of\r\nemotions. Horror, conviction, then furious incredulity. Suddenly he\r\nbegan hastening hither and thither about the room. He moved the\r\nfurniture with fierce jerks, turning ever to see the effect upon the\r\nshadow on the wall. Not a line of its terrible outlines wavered.\r\n\r\n\"It must be something in the room!\" he declared in a voice which seemed\r\nto snap like a lash.\r\n\r\nHis face changed, the inmost secrecy of his nature seemed evident upon\r\nhis face, until one almost lost sight of his lineaments. Rebecca stood\r\nclose to her sofa, regarding him with woeful, fascinated eyes. Mrs.\r\nBrigham clutched Caroline's hand. They both stood in a corner out of his\r\nway. For a few moments he raged about the room like a caged wild animal.\r\nHe moved every piece of furniture; when the moving of a piece did not\r\naffect the shadow he flung it to the floor.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he desisted. He laughed.\r\n\r\n\"What an absurdity,\" he said easily. \"Such a to-do about a shadow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" assented Mrs. Brigham, in a scared voice which she tried to\r\nmake natural. As she spoke she lifted a chair near her.\r\n\r\n\"I think you have broken the chair that Edward was fond of,\" said\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\nTerror and wrath were struggling for expression on her face. Her mouth\r\nwas set, her eyes shrinking. Henry lifted the chair with a show of\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Just as good as ever,\" he said pleasantly. He laughed again, looking at\r\nhis sisters. \"Did I scare you?\" he said. \"I should think you might be\r\nused to me by this time. You know my way of wanting to leap to the\r\nbottom of a mystery, and that shadow does look--queer, like--and I\r\nthought if there was any way of accounting for it I would like to\r\nwithout any delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem to have succeeded,\" remarked Caroline dryly, with a\r\nslight glance at the wall.\r\n\r\nHenry's eyes followed hers and he quivered perceptibly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there is no accounting for shadows,\" he said, and he laughed again.\r\n\"A man is a fool to try to account for shadows.\"\r\n\r\nThen the supper bell rang, and they all left the room, but Henry kept\r\nhis back to the wall--as did, indeed, the others.\r\n\r\nHenry led the way with an alert motion like a boy; Rebecca brought up\r\nthe rear. She could scarcely walk, her knees trembled so.\r\n\r\n\"I can't sit in that room again this evening,\" she whispered to Caroline\r\nafter supper.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; we will sit in the south room,\" replied Caroline. \"I think\r\nwe will sit in the south parlor,\" she said aloud; \"it isn't as damp as\r\nthe study, and I have a cold.\"\r\n\r\nSo they all sat in the south room with their sewing. Henry read the\r\nnewspaper, his chair drawn close to the lamp on the table. About nine\r\no'clock he rose abruptly and crossed the hall to the study. The three\r\nsisters looked at one another. Mrs. Brigham rose, folded her rustling\r\nskirts compactly round her, and began tiptoeing toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" inquired Rebecca agitatedly.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to see what he is about,\" replied Mrs. Brigham cautiously.\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she pointed to the study door across the hall; it was ajar.\r\nHenry had striven to pull it together behind him, but it had somehow\r\nswollen beyond the limit with curious speed. It was still ajar and a\r\nstreak of light showed from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brigham folded her skirts so tightly that her bulk with its\r\nswelling curves was revealed in a black silk sheath, and she went with a\r\nslow toddle across the hall to the study door. She stood there, her eye\r\nat the crack.\r\n\r\nIn the south room Rebecca stopped sewing and sat watching with dilated\r\neyes. Caroline sewed steadily. What Mrs. Brigham, standing at the crack\r\nin the study door, saw was this:\r\n\r\nHenry Glynn, evidently reasoning that the source of the strange shadow\r\nmust be between the table on which the lamp stood and the wall, was\r\nmaking systematic passes and thrusts with an old sword which had\r\nbelonged to his father all over and through the intervening space. Not\r\nan inch was left unpierced. He seemed to have divided the space into\r\nmathematical sections. He brandished the sword with a sort of cold fury\r\nand calculation; the blade gave out flashes of light, the shadow\r\nremained unmoved. Mrs. Brigham, watching, felt herself cold with horror.\r\n\r\nFinally Henry ceased and stood with the sword in hand and raised as if\r\nto strike, surveying the shadow on the wall threateningly. Mrs. Brigham\r\ntoddled back across the hall and shut the south room door behind her\r\nbefore she related what she had seen.\r\n\r\n\"He looked like a demon,\" she said again. \"Have you got any of that old\r\nwine in the house, Caroline? I don't feel as if I could stand much\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there's plenty,\" said Caroline; \"you can have some when you go to\r\nbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we had all better take some,\" said Mrs. Brigham. \"Oh, Caroline,\r\nwhat----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask; don't speak,\" said Caroline.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not going to,\" replied Mrs. Brigham; \"but----\"\r\n\r\nSoon the three sisters went to their chambers and the south parlor was\r\ndeserted. Caroline called to Henry in the study to put out the light\r\nbefore he came upstairs. They had been gone about an hour when he came\r\ninto the room bringing the lamp which had stood in the study. He set it\r\non the table, and waited a few minutes, pacing up and down. His face was\r\nterrible, his fair complexion showed livid, and his blue eyes seemed\r\ndark blanks of awful reflections.\r\n\r\nThen he took up the lamp and returned to the library. He set the lamp on\r\nthe center table and the shadow sprang out on the wall. Again he studied\r\nthe furniture and moved it about, but deliberately, with none of his\r\nformer frenzy. Nothing affected the shadow. Then he returned to the\r\nsouth room with the lamp and again waited. Again he returned to the\r\nstudy and placed the lamp on the table, and the shadow sprang out upon\r\nthe wall. It was midnight before he went upstairs. Mrs. Brigham and the\r\nother sisters, who could not sleep, heard him.\r\n\r\nThe next day was the funeral. That evening the family sat in the south\r\nroom. Some relatives were with them. Nobody entered the study until\r\nHenry carried a lamp in there after the others had retired for the\r\nnight. He saw again the shadow on the wall leap to an awful life before\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at breakfast Henry Glynn announced that he had to go to\r\nthe city for three days. The sisters looked at him with surprise. He\r\nvery seldom left home, and just now his practice had been neglected on\r\naccount of Edward's death.\r\n\r\n\"How can you leave your patients now?\" asked Mrs. Brigham wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how to, but there is no other way,\" replied Henry easily.\r\n\"I have had a telegram from Dr. Mitford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consultation?\" inquired Mrs. Brigham.\r\n\r\n\"I have business,\" replied Henry.\r\n\r\nDoctor Mitford was an old classmate of his who lived in a neighboring\r\ncity and who occasionally called upon him in the case of a consultation.\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone, Mrs. Brigham said to Caroline that, after all, Henry\r\nhad not said that he was going to consult with Doctor Mitford, and she\r\nthought it very strange.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is very strange,\" said Rebecca with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Caroline.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied Rebecca.\r\n\r\nNobody entered the study that day, nor the next. The third day Henry was\r\nexpected home, but he did not arrive and the last train from the city\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\n\"I call it pretty queer work,\" said Mrs. Brigham. \"The idea of a doctor\r\nleaving his patients at such a time as this, and the idea of a\r\nconsultation lasting three days! There is no sense in it, and _now_ he\r\nhas not come. I don't understand it, for my part.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't either,\" said Rebecca.\r\n\r\nThey were all in the south parlor. There was no light in the study; the\r\ndoor was ajar.\r\n\r\nPresently Mrs. Brigham rose--she could not have told why; something\r\nseemed to impel her--some will outside her own. She went out of the\r\nroom, again wrapping her rustling skirts round that she might pass\r\nnoiselessly, and began pushing at the swollen door of the study.\r\n\r\n\"She has not got any lamp,\" said Rebecca in a shaking voice.\r\n\r\nCaroline, who was writing letters, rose again, took the only remaining\r\nlamp in the room, and followed her sister. Rebecca had risen, but she\r\nstood trembling, not venturing to follow.\r\n\r\nThe doorbell rang, but the others did not hear it; it was on the south\r\ndoor on the other side of the house from the study. Rebecca, after\r\nhesitating until the bell rang the second time, went to the door; she\r\nremembered that the servant was out.\r\n\r\nCaroline and her sister Emma entered the study. Caroline set the lamp on\r\nthe table. They looked at the wall, and there were two shadows. The\r\nsisters stood clutching each other, staring at the awful things on the\r\nwall. Then Rebecca came in, staggering, with a telegram in her hand.\r\n\"Here is--a telegram,\" she gasped. \"Henry is--dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Messenger\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT W.

Le Bihan is going to stop them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go over,\" said I; and I picked up my gun and started across the\r\ncliffs, Portin on one side, Môme on the other.\r\n\r\n\"Who has the list?\" I asked, lighting my pipe. \"You say there is a\r\nlist?\"\r\n\r\n\"The list was found rolled up in a brass cylinder,\" said the chemist. He\r\nadded: \"You should not smoke here. You know that if a single spark\r\ndrifted into the wheat--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but I have a cover to my pipe,\" said I, smiling.\r\n\r\nFortin watched me as I closed the pepper-box arrangement over the\r\nglowing bowl of the pipe. Then he continued:\r\n\r\n\"The list was made out on thick yellow paper; the brass tube has\r\npreserved it. It is as fresh to-day as it was in 1760. You shall see\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that the date?\"\r\n\r\n\"The list is dated 'April, 1760.' The Brigadier Durand has it. It is not\r\nwritten in French.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not written in French!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Fortin solemnly, \"it is written in Breton.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I protested, \"the Breton language was never written or printed in\r\n1760.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except by priests,\" said the chemist.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of but one priest who ever wrote the Breton language,\" I\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nFortin stole a glance at my face.\r\n\r\n\"You mean--the Black Priest?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\nFortin opened his mouth to speak again, hesitated, and finally shut his\r\nteeth obstinately over the wheat stem that he was chewing.\r\n\r\n\"And the Black Priest?\" I suggested encouragingly. But I knew it was\r\nuseless; for it is easier to move the stars from their courses than to\r\nmake an obstinate Breton talk. We walked on for a minute or two in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the Brigadier Durand?\" I asked, motioning Môme to come out of\r\nthe wheat, which he was trampling as though it were heather. As I spoke\r\nwe came in sight of the farther edge of the wheat field and the dark,\r\nwet mass of cliffs beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Durand is down there--you can see him; he stands just behind the mayor\r\nof St. Gildas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said I; and we struck straight down, following a sun-baked\r\ncattle path across the heather.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the edge of the wheat field, Le Bihan, the mayor of St.\r\nGildas, called to me, and I tucked my gun under my arm and skirted the\r\nwheat to where he stood.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-eight skulls,\" he said in his thin, high-pitched voice; \"there\r\nis but one more, and I am opposed to further search. I suppose Fortin\r\ntold you?\"\r\n\r\nI shook hands with him, and returned the salute of the Brigadier Durand.\r\n\r\n\"I am opposed to further search,\" repeated Le Bihan, nervously picking\r\nat the mass of silver buttons which covered the front of his velvet and\r\nbroadcloth jacket like a breastplate of scale armor.\r\n\r\nDurand pursed up his lips, twisted his tremendous mustache, and hooked\r\nhis thumbs in his saber belt.\r\n\r\n\"As for me,\" he said, \"I am in favor of further search.\"\r\n\r\n\"Further search for what--for the thirty-ninth skull?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nLe Bihan nodded. Durand frowned at the sunlit sea, rocking like a bowl\r\nof molten gold from the cliffs to the horizon. I followed his eyes. On\r\nthe dark glistening cliffs, silhouetted against the glare of the sea,\r\nsat a cormorant, black, motionless, its horrible head raised toward\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n\"Where is that list, Durand?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe gendarme rummaged in his despatch pouch and produced a brass\r\ncylinder about a foot long. Very gravely he unscrewed the head and\r\ndumped out a scroll of thick yellow paper closely covered with writing\r\non both sides. At a nod from Le Bihan he handed me the scroll. But I\r\ncould make nothing of the coarse writing, now faded to a dull brown.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Le Bihan,\" I said impatiently, \"translate it, won't you?\r\nYou and Max Fortin make a lot of mystery out of nothing, it seems.\"\r\n\r\nLe Bihan went to the edge of the pit where the three Bannalec men were\r\ndigging, gave an order or two in Breton, and turned to me.\r\n\r\nAs I came to the edge of the pit the Bannalec men were removing a square\r\npiece of sailcloth from what appeared to be a pile of cobblestones.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" said Le Bihan shrilly. I looked. The pile below was a heap of\r\nskulls. After a moment I clambered down the gravel sides of the pit and\r\nwalked over to the men of Bannalec. They saluted me gravely, leaning on\r\ntheir picks and shovels, and wiping their sweating faces with sunburned\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"How many?\" said I in Breton.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-eight,\" they replied.\r\n\r\nI glanced around. Beyond the heap of skulls lay two piles of human\r\nbones. Beside these was a mound of broken, rusted bits of iron and\r\nsteel. Looking closer, I saw that this mound was composed of rusty\r\nbayonets, saber blades, scythe blades, with here and there a tarnished\r\nbuckle attached to a bit of leather hard as iron.\r\n\r\nI picked up a couple of buttons and a belt plate. The buttons bore the\r\nroyal arms of England; the belt plate was emblazoned with the English\r\narms and also with the number \"27.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard my grandfather speak of the terrible English regiment, the\r\n27th Foot, which landed and stormed the fort up there,\" said one of the\r\nBannalec men.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said I; \"then these are the bones of English soldiers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the men of Bannalec.\r\n\r\nLe Bihan was calling to me from the edge of the pit above, and I handed\r\nthe belt plate and buttons to the men and climbed the side of the\r\nexcavation.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, trying to prevent Môme from leaping up and licking my\r\nface as I emerged from the pit, \"I suppose you know what these bones\r\nare. What are you going to do with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a man,\" said Le Bihan angrily, \"an Englishman, who passed\r\nhere in a dog-cart on his way to Quimper about an hour ago, and what do\r\nyou suppose he wished to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Buy the relics?\" I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly--the pig!\" piped the mayor of St. Gildas. \"Jean Marie Tregunc,\r\nwho found the bones, was standing there where Max Fortin stands, and do\r\nyou know what he answered? He spat upon the ground, and said: 'Pig of an\r\nEnglishman, do you take me for a desecrator of graves?'\"\r\n\r\nI knew Tregunc, a sober, blue-eyed Breton, who lived from one year's end\r\nto the other without being able to afford a single bit of meat for a\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\n\"How much did the Englishman offer Tregunc?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred francs for the skulls alone.\"\r\n\r\nI thought of the relic hunters and the relic buyers on the battlefields\r\nof our civil war.\r\n\r\n\"Seventeen hundred and sixty is long ago,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Respect for the dead can never die,\" said Fortin.\r\n\r\n\"And the English soldiers came here to kill your fathers and burn your\r\nhomes,\" I continued.\r\n\r\n\"They were murderers and thieves, but--they are dead,\" said Tregunc,\r\ncoming up from the beach below, his long sea rake balanced on his\r\ndripping jersey.\r\n\r\n\"How much do you earn every year, Jean Marie?\" I asked, turning to shake\r\nhands with him.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred and twenty francs, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-five dollars a year,\" I said. \"Bah! you are worth more, Jean.\r\nWill you take care of my garden for me? My wife wished me to ask you. I\r\nthink it would be worth one hundred francs a month to you and to me.\r\nCome on, Le Bihan--come along, Fortin--and you, Durand. I want somebody\r\nto translate that list into French for me.\"\r\n\r\nTregunc stood gazing at me, his blue eyes dilated.\r\n\r\n\"You may begin at once,\" I said, smiling, \"if the salary suits you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It suits,\" said Tregunc, fumbling for his pipe in a silly way that\r\nannoyed Le Bihan.\r\n\r\n\"Then go and begin your work,\" cried the mayor impatiently; and Tregunc\r\nstarted across the moors toward St. Gildas, taking off his\r\nvelvet-ribboned cap to me and gripping his sea rake very hard.\r\n\r\n\"You offer him more than my salary,\" said the mayor, after a moment's\r\ncontemplation of his silver buttons.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said I, \"what do you do for your salary except play dominoes\r\nwith Max Portin at the Groix Inn?\"\r\n\r\nLe Bihan turned red, but Durand rattled his saber and winked at Max\r\nFortin, and I slipped my arm through the arm of the sulky magistrate,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"There's a shady spot under the cliff,\" I said; \"come on, Le Bihan, and\r\nread me what is in the scroll.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments we reached the shadow of the cliff, and I threw myself\r\nupon the turf, chin on hand, to listen.\r\n\r\nThe gendarme, Durand, also sat down, twisting his mustache into\r\nneedlelike points. Fortin leaned against the cliff, polishing his\r\nglasses and examining us with vague, near-sighted eyes; and Le Bihan,\r\nthe mayor, planted himself in our midst, rolling up the scroll and\r\ntucking it under his arm.\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" he began in a shrill voice, \"I am going to light my\r\npipe, and while lighting it I shall tell you what I have heard about the\r\nattack on the fort yonder. My father told me; his father told him.\"\r\n\r\nHe jerked his head in the direction of the ruined fort, a small, square\r\nstone structure on the sea cliff, now nothing but crumbling walls. Then\r\nhe slowly produced a tobacco pouch, a bit of flint and tinder, and a\r\nlong-stemmed pipe fitted with a microscopical bowl of baked clay. To\r\nfill such a pipe requires ten minutes' close attention. To smoke it to a\r\nfinish takes but four puffs. It is very Breton, this Breton pipe. It is\r\nthe crystallization of everything Breton.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said I, lighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"The fort,\" said the mayor, \"was built by Louis XIV, and was dismantled\r\ntwice by the English. Louis XV restored it in 1730. In 1760 it was\r\ncarried by assault by the English. They came across from the island of\r\nGroix--three shiploads, and they stormed the fort and sacked St. Julien\r\nyonder, and they started to burn St. Gildas--you can see the marks of\r\ntheir bullets on my house yet; but the men of Bannalec and the men of\r\nLorient fell upon them with pike and scythe and blunderbuss, and those\r\nwho did not run away lie there below in the gravel pit now--thirty-eight\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the thirty-ninth skull?\" I asked, finishing my cigarette.\r\n\r\nThe mayor had succeeded in filling his pipe, and now he began to put his\r\ntobacco pouch away.\r\n\r\n\"The thirty-ninth skull,\" he mumbled, holding the pipe stem between his\r\ndefective teeth--\"the thirty-ninth skull is no business of mine. I have\r\ntold the Bannalec men to cease digging.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is--whose is the missing skull?\" I persisted curiously.\r\n\r\nThe mayor was busy trying to strike a spark to his tinder. Presently he\r\nset it aglow, applied it to his pipe, took the prescribed four puffs,\r\nknocked the ashes out of the bowl, and gravely replaced the pipe in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\"The missing skull?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, impatiently.\r\n\r\nThe mayor slowly unrolled the scroll and began to read, translating from\r\nthe Breton into French. And this is what he read:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        \"ON THE CLIFFS OF ST. GILDAS,\r\n                                           APRIL 13, 1760.\r\n\r\n\"On this day, by order of the Count of Soisic, general in chief of the\r\nBreton forces now lying in Kerselec Forest, the bodies of thirty-eight\r\nEnglish soldiers of the 27th, 50th, and 72d regiments of Foot were\r\nburied in this spot, together with their arms and equipments.\"\r\n\r\nThe mayor paused and glanced at me reflectively.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, Le Bihan,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"With them,\" continued the mayor, turning the scroll and reading on the\r\nother side, \"was buried the body of that vile traitor who betrayed the\r\nfort to the English. The manner of his death was as follows: By order of\r\nthe most noble Count of Soisic, the traitor was first branded upon the\r\nforehead with the brand of an arrowhead. The iron burned through the\r\nflesh and was pressed heavily so that the brand should even burn into\r\nthe bone of the skull. The traitor was then led out and bidden to\r\nkneel. He admitted having guided the English from the island of Groix.\r\nAlthough a priest and a Frenchman, he had violated his priestly office\r\nto aid him in discovering the password to the fort. This password he\r\nextorted during confession from a young Breton girl who was in the habit\r\nof rowing across from the island of Groix to visit her husband in the\r\nfort. When the fort fell, this young girl, crazed by the death of her\r\nhusband, sought the Count of Soisic and told how the priest had forced\r\nher to confess to him all she knew about the fort. The priest was\r\narrested at St. Gildas as he was about to cross the river to Lorient.\r\nWhen arrested he cursed the girl, Marie Trevec----\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed, \"Marie Trevec!\"\r\n\r\n\"Marie Trevec,\" repeated Le Bihan; \"the priest cursed Marie Trevec, and\r\nall her family and descendants. He was shot as he knelt, having a mask\r\nof leather over his face, because the Bretons who composed the squad of\r\nexecution refused to fire at a priest unless his face was concealed. The\r\npriest was l'Abbé Sorgue, commonly known as the Black Priest on account\r\nof his dark face and swarthy eyebrows. He was buried with a stake\r\nthrough his heart.\"\r\n\r\nLe Bihan paused, hesitated, looked at me, and handed the manuscript back\r\nto Durand. The gendarme took it and slipped it into the brass cylinder.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said I, \"the thirty-ninth skull is the skull of the Black\r\nPriest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Fortin. \"I hope they won't find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have forbidden them to proceed,\" said the mayor querulously. \"You\r\nheard me, Max Fortin.\"\r\n\r\nI rose and picked up my gun. Môme came and pushed his head into my hand.\r\n\r\n\"That's a fine dog,\" observed Durand, also rising.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you wish to find his skull?\" I asked Le Bihan. \"It would be\r\ncurious to see whether the arrow brand really burned into the bone.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something in that scroll that I didn't read to you,\" said the\r\nmayor grimly. \"Do you wish to know what it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" I replied in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the scroll again, Durand,\" he said; then he read from the\r\nbottom: \"I, l'Abbé Sorgue, forced to write the above by my executioners,\r\nhave written it in my own blood; and with it I leave my curse. My curse\r\non St. Gildas, on Marie Trevec, and on her descendants. I will come back\r\nto St. Gildas when my remains are disturbed. Woe to that Englishman whom\r\nmy branded skull shall touch!\"\r\n\r\n\"What rot!\" I said. \"Do you believe it was really written in his own\r\nblood?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to test it,\" said Fortin, \"at the request of Monsieur le\r\nMaire. I am not anxious for the job, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said Le Bihan, holding out the scroll to me, \"it is signed,\r\n'L'Abbé Sorgue.'\"\r\n\r\nI glanced curiously over the paper.\r\n\r\n\"It must be the Black Priest,\" I said. \"He was the only man who wrote in\r\nthe Breton language. This is a wonderfully interesting discovery, for\r\nnow, at last, the mystery of the Black Priest's disappearance is cleared\r\nup. You will, of course, send this scroll to Paris, Le Bihan?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the mayor obstinately, \"it shall be buried in the pit below\r\nwhere the rest of the Black Priest lies.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him and recognized that argument would be useless. But still\r\nI said, \"It will be a loss to history, Monsieur Le Bihan.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the worse for history, then,\" said the enlightened Mayor of St.\r\nGildas.\r\n\r\nWe had sauntered back to the gravel pit while speaking. The men of\r\nBannalec were carrying the bones of the English soldiers toward the St.\r\nGildas cemetery, on the cliffs to the east, where already a knot of\r\nwhite-coiffed women stood in attitudes of prayer; and I saw the somber\r\nrobe of a priest among the crosses of the little graveyard.\r\n\r\n\"They were thieves and assassins; they are dead now,\" muttered Max\r\nFortin.\r\n\r\n\"Respect the dead,\" repeated the Mayor of St. Gildas, looking after the\r\nBannalec men.\r\n\r\n\"It was written in that scroll that Marie Trevec, of Groix Island, was\r\ncursed by the priest--she and her descendants,\" I said, touching Le\r\nBihan on the arm. \"There was a Marie Trevec who married an Yves Trevec\r\nof St. Gildas----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the same,\" said Le Bihan, looking at me obliquely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said I; \"then they were ancestors of my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you fear the curse?\" asked Le Bihan.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I laughed.\r\n\r\n\"There was the case of the Purple Emperor,\" said Max Fortin timidly.\r\n\r\nStartled for a moment, I faced him, then shrugged my shoulders and\r\nkicked at a smooth bit of rock which lay near the edge of the pit,\r\nalmost embedded in gravel.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose the Purple-Emperor drank himself crazy because he was\r\ndescended from Marie Trevec?\" I asked contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Max Fortin hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" piped the mayor. \"I only--Hellow! what's that you're\r\nkicking?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said I, glancing down, at the same time involuntarily giving\r\nanother kick. The smooth bit of rock dislodged itself and rolled out of\r\nthe loosened gravel at my feet.\r\n\r\n\"The thirty-ninth skull!\" I exclaimed. \"By jingo, it's the noddle of the\r\nBlack Priest! See! there is the arrowhead branded on the front!\"\r\n\r\nThe mayor stepped back. Max Fortin also retreated. There was a pause,\r\nduring which I looked at them, and they looked anywhere but at me.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it,\" said the mayor at last, in a husky, high voice. \"I\r\ndon't like it! The scroll says he will come back to St. Gildas when his\r\nremains are disturbed. I--I don't like it, Monsieur Darrel--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bosh!\" said I; \"the poor wicked devil is where he can't get out. For\r\nHeaven's sake, Le Bihan, what is this stuff you are talking in the year\r\nof grace 1896?\"\r\n\r\nThe mayor gave me a look.\r\n\r\n\"And he says 'Englishman.' You are an Englishman, Monsieur Darrel,\" he\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n\"You know better. You know I'm an American.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all the same,\" said the Mayor of St. Gildas, obstinately.\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't!\" I answered, much exasperated, and deliberately pushed\r\nthe skull till it rolled into the bottom of the gravel pit below.\r\n\r\n\"Cover it up,\" said I; \"bury the scroll with it too, if you insist, but\r\nI think you ought to send it to Paris. Don't look so gloomy, Fortin,\r\nunless you believe in werewolves and ghosts. Hey! what the--what the\r\ndevil's the matter with you, anyway? What are you staring at, Le Bihan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" muttered the mayor in a low, tremulous voice, \"it's time\r\nwe got out of this. Did you see? Did you see, Fortin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw,\" whispered Max Fortin, pallid with fright.\r\n\r\nThe two men were almost running across the sunny pasture now, and I\r\nhastened after them, demanding to know what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Matter!\" chattered the mayor, gasping with exasperation and terror.\r\n\"The skull is rolling up hill again,\" and he burst into a terrified\r\ngallop, Max Fortin followed close behind.\r\n\r\nI watched them stampeding across the pasture, then turned toward the\r\ngravel pit, mystified, incredulous. The skull was lying on the edge of\r\nthe pit, exactly where it had been before I pushed it over the edge. For\r\na second I stared at it; a singular chilly feeling crept up my spinal\r\ncolumn, and I turned and walked away, sweat starting from the root of\r\nevery hair on my head. Before I had gone twenty paces the absurdity of\r\nthe whole thing struck me. I halted, hot with shame and annoyance, and\r\nretraced my steps.\r\n\r\nThere lay the skull.\r\n\r\n\"I rolled a stone down instead of the skull,\" I muttered to myself. Then\r\nwith the butt of my gun I pushed the skull over the edge of the pit and\r\nwatched it roll to the bottom; and as it struck the bottom of the pit,\r\nMôme, my dog, suddenly whipped his tail between his legs, whimpered, and\r\nmade off across the moor.\r\n\r\n\"Môme!\" I shouted, angry and astonished; but the dog only fled the\r\nfaster, and I ceased calling from sheer surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What the mischief is the matter with that dog!\" I thought. He had never\r\nbefore played me such a trick.\r\n\r\nMechanically I glanced into the pit, but I could not see the skull. I\r\nlooked down. The skull lay at my feet again, touching them.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" I stammered, and struck at it blindly with my gunstock.\r\nThe ghastly thing flew into the air, whirling over and over, and rolled\r\nagain down the sides of the pit to the bottom. Breathlessly I stared at\r\nit, then, confused and scarcely comprehending, I stepped back from the\r\npit, still facing it, one, ten, twenty paces, my eyes almost starting\r\nfrom my head, as though I expected to see the thing roll up from the\r\nbottom of the pit under my very gaze. At last I turned my back to the\r\npit and strode out across the gorse-covered moorland toward my home. As\r\nI reached the road that winds from St. Gildas to St. Julien I gave one\r\nhasty glance at the pit over my shoulder. The sun shone hot on the sod\r\nabout the excavation. There was something white and bare and round on\r\nthe turf at the edge of the pit. It might have been a stone; there were\r\nplenty of them lying about.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen I entered my garden I saw Môme sprawling on the stone doorstep. He\r\neyed me sideways and flopped his tail.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not mortified, you idiot dog?\" I said, looking about the upper\r\nwindows for Lys.\r\n\r\nMôme rolled over on his back and raised one deprecating forepaw, as\r\nthough to ward off calamity.\r\n\r\n\"Don't act as though I was in the habit of beating you to death,\" I\r\nsaid, disgusted. I had never in my life raised whip to the brute. \"But\r\nyou are a fool dog,\" I continued. \"No, you needn't come to be babied and\r\nwept over; Lys can do that, if she insists, but I am ashamed of you, and\r\nyou can go to the devil.\"\r\n\r\nMôme slunk off into the house, and I followed, mounting directly to my\r\nwife's boudoir. It was empty.\r\n\r\n\"Where has she gone?\" I said, looking hard at Môme, who had followed me.\r\n\"Oh! I see you don't know. Don't pretend you do. Come off that lounge!\r\nDo you think Lys wants tan-colored hairs all over her lounge?\"\r\n\r\nI rang the bell for Catherine and Fine, but they didn't know where\r\n\"madame\" had gone; so I went into my room, bathed, exchanged my somewhat\r\ngrimy shooting clothes for a suit of warm, soft knickerbockers, and,\r\nafter lingering some extra moments over my toilet--for I was particular,\r\nnow that I had married Lys--I went down to the garden and took a chair\r\nout under the fig-trees.\r\n\r\n\"Where can she be?\" I wondered, Môme came sneaking out to be comforted,\r\nand I forgave him for Lys's sake, whereupon he frisked.\r\n\r\n\"You bounding cur,\" said I, \"now what on earth started you off across\r\nthe moor? If you do it again I'll push you along with a charge of dust\r\nshot.\"\r\n\r\nAs yet I had scarcely dared think about the ghastly hallucination of\r\nwhich I had been a victim, but now I faced it squarely, flushing a\r\nlittle with mortification at the thought of my hasty retreat from the\r\ngravel pit.\r\n\r\n\"To think,\" I said aloud, \"that those old woman's tales of Max Fortin\r\nand Le Bihan should have actually made me see what didn't exist at all!\r\nI lost my nerve like a schoolboy in a dark bedroom.\" For I knew now that\r\nI had mistaken a round stone for a skull each time, and had pushed a\r\ncouple of big pebbles into the pit instead of the skull itself.\r\n\r\n\"By jingo!\" said I, \"I'm nervous; my liver must be in a devil of a\r\ncondition if I see such things when I'm awake! Lys will know what to\r\ngive me.\"\r\n\r\nI felt mortified and irritated and sulky, and thought disgustedly of Le\r\nBihan and Max Fortin.\r\n\r\nBut after a while I ceased speculating, dismissed the mayor, the\r\nchemist, and the skull from my mind, and smoked pensively, watching the\r\nsun low dipping in the western ocean. As the twilight fell for a moment\r\nover ocean and moorland, a wistful, restless happiness filled my heart,\r\nthe happiness that all men know--all men who have loved.\r\n\r\nSlowly the purple mist crept out over the sea; the cliffs darkened; the\r\nforest was shrouded.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sky above burned with the afterglow, and the world was\r\nalight again.\r\n\r\nCloud after cloud caught the rose dye; the cliffs were tinted with it;\r\nmoor and pasture, heather and forest burned and pulsated with the\r\ngentle flush. I saw the gulls turning and tossing above the sand bar,\r\ntheir snowy wings tipped with pink; I saw the sea swallows sheering the\r\nsurface of the still river, stained to its placid depths with warm\r\nreflections of the clouds. The twitter of drowsy hedge birds broke out\r\nin the stillness; a salmon rolled its shining side above tidewater.\r\n\r\nThe interminable monotone of the ocean intensified the silence. I sat\r\nmotionless, holding my breath as one who listens to the first low rumor\r\nof an organ. All at once the pure whistle of a nightingale cut the\r\nsilence, and the first moonbeam silvered the wastes of mist-hung waters.\r\n\r\nI raised my head.\r\n\r\nLys stood before me in the garden.\r\n\r\nWhen we had kissed each other, we linked arms and moved up and down the\r\ngravel walks, watching the moonbeams sparkle on the sand bar as the tide\r\nebbed and ebbed. The broad beds of white pinks about us were atremble\r\nwith hovering white moths; the October roses hung all abloom, perfuming\r\nthe salt wind.\r\n\r\n\"Sweetheart,\" I said, \"where is Yvonne? Has she promised to spend\r\nChristmas with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Dick; she drove me down from Plougat this afternoon. She sent her\r\nlove to you. I am not jealous. What did you shoot?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hare and four partridges. They are in the gun room. I told Catherine\r\nnot to touch them until you had seen them.\"\r\n\r\nNow I suppose I knew that Lys could not be particularly enthusiastic\r\nover game or guns; but she pretended she was, and always scornfully\r\ndenied that it was for my sake and not for the pure love of sport. So\r\nshe dragged me off to inspect the rather meager game bag, and she paid\r\nme pretty compliments, and gave a little cry of delight and pity as I\r\nlifted the enormous hare out of the sack by his ears.\r\n\r\n\"He'll eat no more of our lettuce,\" I said attempting to justify the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy little bunny--and what a beauty! O Dick, you are a splendid\r\nshot, are you not?\"\r\n\r\nI evaded the question and hauled out a partridge.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little dead things'\" said Lys in a whisper; \"it seems a\r\npity--doesn't it, Dick? But then you are so clever----\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have them broiled,\" I said guardedly, \"tell Catherine.\"\r\n\r\nCatherine came in to take away the game, and presently 'Fine Lelocard,\r\nLys's maid, announced dinner, and Lys tripped away to her boudoir.\r\n\r\nI stood an instant contemplating her blissfully, thinking, \"My boy,\r\nyou're the happiest fellow in the world--you're in love with your wife'\"\r\n\r\nI walked into the dining-room, beamed at the plates, walked out again;\r\nmet Tregunc in the hallway, beamed on him; glanced into the kitchen,\r\nbeamed at Catherine, and went up stairs, still beaming.\r\n\r\nBefore I could knock at Lys's door it opened, and Lys came hastily out.\r\nWhen she saw me she gave a little cry of relief, and nestled close to my\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\"There is something peering in at my window,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I cried angrily.\r\n\r\n\"A man, I think, disguised as a priest, and he has a mask on. He must\r\nhave climbed up by the bay tree.\"\r\n\r\nI was down the stairs and out of doors in no time. The moonlit garden\r\nwas absolutely deserted. Tregunc came up, and together we searched the\r\nhedge and shrubbery around the house and out to the road.\r\n\r\n\"Jean Marie,\" said I at length, \"loose my bulldog--he knows you--and\r\ntake your supper on the porch where you can watch. My wife says the\r\nfellow is disguised as a priest, and wears a mask.\"\r\n\r\nTregunc showed his white teeth in a smile. \"He will not care to venture\r\nin here again, I think, Monsieur Darrel.\"\r\n\r\nI went back and found Lys seated quietly at the table.\r\n\r\n\"The soup is ready, dear,\" she said. \"Don't worry; it was only some\r\nfoolish lout from Bannalec. No one in St. Gildas or St. Julien would do\r\nsuch a thing.\"\r\n\r\nI was too much exasperated to reply at first, but Lys treated it as a\r\nstupid joke, and after a while I began to look at it in that light.\r\n\r\nLys told me about Yvonne, and reminded me of my promise to have Herbert\r\nStuart down to meet her.\r\n\r\n\"You wicked diplomat!\" I protested. \"Herbert is in Paris, and hard at\r\nwork for the Salon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think he might spare a week to flirt with the prettiest girl\r\nin Finistere?\" inquired Lys innocently.\r\n\r\n\"Prettiest girl! Not much!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Who is, then?\" urged Lys.\r\n\r\nI laughed a trifle sheepishly.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you mean me, Dick,\" said Lys, coloring up.\r\n\r\n\"Now I bore you, don't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bore me? Ah, no, Dick.\"\r\n\r\nAfter coffee and cigarettes were served I spoke about Tregunc, and Lys\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Jean! He will be glad, won't he? What a dear fellow you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said I; \"we need a gardener; you said so yourself, Lys.\"\r\n\r\nBut Lys leaned over and kissed me, and then bent down and hugged\r\nMôme--who whistled through his nose in sentimental appreciation.\r\n\r\n\"I am a very happy woman,\" said Lys.\r\n\r\n\"Môme was a very bad dog to-day,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Môme!\" said Lys, smiling.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over and Môme lay snoring before the blaze--for the\r\nOctober nights are often chilly in Finistere--Lys curled up in the\r\nchimney corner with her embroidery, and gave me a swift glance from\r\nunder her dropping lashes.\r\n\r\n\"You look like a schoolgirl, Lys,\" I said teasingly. \"I don't believe\r\nyou are sixteen yet.\"\r\n\r\nShe pushed back her heavy burnished hair thoughtfully. Her wrist was as\r\nwhite as surf foam.\r\n\r\n\"Have we been married four years? I don't believe it,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe gave me another swift glance and touched the embroidery on her knee,\r\nsmiling faintly.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said I, also smiling at the embroidered garment. \"Do you think\r\nit will fit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fit?\" repeated Lys. Then she laughed\r\n\r\n\"And,\" I persisted, \"are you perfectly sure that you--er--we shall need\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly,\" said Lys. A delicate color touched her cheeks and neck. She\r\nheld up the little garment, all fluffy with misty lace and wrought with\r\nquaint embroidery.\r\n\r\n\"It is very gorgeous,\" said I; \"don't use your eyes too much, dearest.\r\nMay I smoke a pipe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she said selecting a skein of pale blue silk.\r\n\r\nFor a while I sat and smoked in silence, watching her slender fingers\r\namong the tinted silks and thread of gold.\r\n\r\nPresently she spoke: \"What did you say your crest is, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"My crest? Oh, something or other rampant on a something or other----\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be flippant.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I really forget. It's an ordinary crest; everybody in New York has\r\nthem. No family should be without 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are disagreeable, Dick. Send Josephine upstairs for my album.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to put that crest on the--the--whatever it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am; and my own crest, too.\"\r\n\r\nI thought of the Purple Emperor and wondered a little.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't know I had one, did you?\" she smiled.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" I replied evasively.\r\n\r\n\"You shall see. Ring for Josephine.\"\r\n\r\nI rang, and, when 'Fine appeared, Lys gave her some orders in a low\r\nvoice, and Josephine trotted away, bobbing her white-coiffed head with a\r\n\"Bien, Madame!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes she returned, bearing a tattered, musty volume, from\r\nwhich the gold and blue had mostly disappeared.\r\n\r\nI took the book in my hands and examined the ancient emblazoned covers.\r\n\r\n\"Lilies!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Fleur-de-lis,\" said my wife demurely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said I, astonished, and opened the book.\r\n\r\n\"You have never before seen this book?\" asked Lys, with a touch of\r\nmalice in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You know I haven't. Hello! What's this? Oho! So there should be a de\r\nbefore Trevec? Lys de Trevec? Then why in the world did the Purple\r\nEmperor----\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick!\" cried Lys.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said I. \"Shall I read about the Sieur de Trevec who rode to\r\nSaladin's tent alone to seek for medicine for St. Louise? Or shall I\r\nread about--what is it? Oh, here it is, all down in black and\r\nwhite--about the Marquis de Trevec who drowned himself before Alva's\r\neyes rather than surrender the banner of the fleur-de-lis to Spain? It's\r\nall written here. But, dear, how about that soldier named Trevec who was\r\nkilled in the old fort on the cliff yonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"He dropped the de, and the Trevecs since then have been Republicans,\"\r\nsaid Lys--\"all except me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's quite right,\" said I; \"it is time that we Republicans should\r\nagree upon some feudal system. My dear, I drink to the king!\" and I\r\nraised my wine glass and looked at Lys.\r\n\r\n\"To the king,\" said Lys, flushing. She smoothed out the tiny garment on\r\nher knees; she touched the glass with her lips; her eyes were very\r\nsweet. I drained the glass to the king.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence I said: \"I will tell the king stories. His majesty shall\r\nbe amused.\"\r\n\r\n\"His majesty,\" repeated Lys softly.\r\n\r\n\"Or hers,\" I laughed. \"Who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" murmured Lys; with a gentle sigh.\r\n\r\n\"I know some stories about Jack the Giant-Killer,\" I announced. \"Do\r\nyou, Lys?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? No, not about a giant-killer, but I know all about the werewolf, and\r\nJeanne-la-Flamme, and the Man in Purple Tatters, and--O dear me, I know\r\nlots more.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very wise,\" said I. \"I shall teach his majesty, English.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I Breton,\" cried Lys jealously.\r\n\r\n\"I shall bring playthings to the king,\" said I--\"big green lizards from\r\nthe gorse, little gray mullets to swim in glass globes, baby rabbits\r\nfrom the forest of Kerselec----\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Lys, \"will bring the first primrose, the first branch of\r\naubepine, the first jonquil, to the king--my king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our king,\" said I; and there was peace in Finistere.\r\n\r\nI lay back, idly turning the leaves of the curious old volume.\r\n\r\n\"I am looking,\" said I, \"for the crest.\"\r\n\r\n\"The crest, dear? It is a priest's head with an arrow-shaped mark on the\r\nforehead, on a field----\"\r\n\r\nI sat up and stared at my wife.\r\n\r\n\"Dick, whatever is the matter?\" she smiled. \"The story is there in that\r\nbook. Do you care to read it? No? Shall I tell it to you? Well, then: It\r\nhappened in the third crusade. There was a monk whom men called the\r\nBlack Priest. He turned apostate, and sold himself to the enemies of\r\nChrist. A Sieur de Trevec burst into the Saracen camp, at the head of\r\nonly one hundred lances, and carried the Black Priest away out of the\r\nvery midst of their army.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that is how you come by the crest,\" I said quietly; but I thought of\r\nthe branded skull in the gravel pit, and wondered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lys. \"The Sieur de Trevec cut the Black Priest's head off,\r\nbut first he branded him with an arrow mark on the forehead. The book\r\nsays it was a pious action, and the Sieur de Trevec got great merit by\r\nit. But I think it was cruel, the branding,\" she sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of any other Black Priest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There was one in the last century, here in St. Gildas. He cast a\r\nwhite shadow in the sun. He wrote in the Breton language. Chronicles,\r\ntoo, I believe. I never saw them. His name was the same as that of the\r\nold chronicler, and of the other priest, Jacques Sorgue. Some said he\r\nwas a lineal descendant of the traitor. Of course the first Black Priest\r\nwas bad enough for anything. But if he did have a child, it need not\r\nhave been the ancestor of the last Jacques Sorgue. They say he was so\r\ngood he was not allowed to die, but was caught up to heaven one day,\"\r\nadded Lys, with believing eyes.\r\n\r\nI smiled.\r\n\r\n\"But he disappeared,\" persisted Lys.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid his journey was in another direction,\" I said jestingly, and\r\nthoughtlessly told her the story of the morning. I had utterly\r\nforgotten the masked man at her window, but before I finished I\r\nremembered him fast enough, and realized what I had done as I saw her\r\nface whiten.\r\n\r\n\"Lys,\" I urged tenderly, \"that was only some clumsy clown's trick. You\r\nsaid so yourself. You are not superstitious, my dear?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were on mine. She slowly drew the little gold cross from her\r\nbosom and kissed it. But her lips trembled as they pressed the symbol of\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock the next morning I walked into the Groix Inn and sat\r\ndown at the long discolored oaken table, nodding good-day to Marianne\r\nBruyere, who in turn bobbed her white coiffe at me.\r\n\r\n\"My clever Bannalec maid,\" said I, \"what is good for a stirrup-cup at\r\nthe Groix Inn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Schist?\" she inquired in Breton.\r\n\r\n\"With a dash of red wine, then,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nShe brought the delicious Quimperle cider, and I poured a little\r\nBordeaux into it. Marianne watched me with laughing black eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What makes your cheeks so red, Marianne?\" I asked. \"Has Jean Marie been\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are to be married, Monsieur Darrel,\" she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Since when has Jean Marie Tregunc lost his head?\"\r\n\r\n\"His head? Oh, Monsieur Darrel--his heart, you mean!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I do,\" said I. \"Jean Marie is a practical fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all due to your kindness--\" began the girl, but I raised my hand\r\nand held up the glass.\r\n\r\n\"It's due to himself. To your happiness, Marianne\"; and I took a hearty\r\ndraught of the schist. \"Now,\" said I, \"tell me where I can find Le Bihan\r\nand Max Fortin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Le Bihan and Monsieur Fortin are above in the broad room. I\r\nbelieve they are examining the Red Admiral's effects.\"\r\n\r\n\"To send them to Paris? Oh, I know. May I go up, Marianne?\"\r\n\r\n\"And God go with you,\" smiled the girl.\r\n\r\nWhen I knocked at the door of the broad room above little Max Fortin\r\nopened it. Dust covered his spectacles and nose; his hat, with the tiny\r\nvelvet ribbons fluttering, was all awry.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Monsieur Darrel,\" he said; \"the mayor and I are packing up the\r\neffects of the Purple Emperor and of the poor Red Admiral.\"\r\n\r\n\"The collections?\" I asked, entering the room. \"You must be very careful\r\nin packing those butterfly cases; the slightest jar might break wings\r\nand antennas, you know.\"\r\n\r\nLe Bihan shook hands with me and pointed to the great pile of boxes.\r\n\r\n\"They're all cork lined,\" he said, \"but Fortin and I are putting felt\r\naround each box. The Entomological Society of Paris pays the freight.\"\r\n\r\nThe combined collection of the Red Admiral and the Purple Emperor made a\r\nmagnificent display.\r\n\r\nI lifted and inspected case after case set with gorgeous butterflies and\r\nmoths, each specimen carefully labelled with the name in Latin. There\r\nwere cases filled with crimson tiger moths all aflame with color; cases\r\ndevoted to the common yellow butterflies; symphonies in orange and pale\r\nyellow; cases of soft gray and dun-colored sphinx moths; and cases of\r\ngrayish nettle-bed butterflies of the numerous family of Vanessa.\r\n\r\nAll alone in a great case by itself was pinned the purple emperor, the\r\nApatura Iris, that fatal specimen that had given the Purple Emperor his\r\nname and quietus.\r\n\r\nI remembered the butterfly, and stood looking at it with bent eyebrows.\r\n\r\nLe Bihan glanced up from the floor where he was nailing down the lid of\r\na box full of cases.\r\n\r\n\"It is settled, then,\" said he, \"that madame, your wife, gives the\r\nPurple Emperor's entire Collection to the city of Paris?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Without accepting anything for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a gift,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Including the purple emperor there in the case? That butterfly is\r\nworth a great deal of money,\" persisted Le Bihan.\r\n\r\n\"You don't suppose that we would wish to sell that specimen, do you?\" I\r\nanswered a trifle sharply.\r\n\r\n\"If I were you I should destroy it,\" said the mayor in his high-pitched\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"That would be nonsense,\" said I, \"like your burying the brass cylinder\r\nand scroll yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not nonsense,\" said Le Bihan doggedly, \"and I should prefer not\r\nto discuss the subject of the scroll.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at Max Portin, who immediately avoided my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You are a pair of superstitious old women,\" said I, digging my hands\r\ninto my pockets; \"you swallow every nursery tale that is invented.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\" said Le Bihan sulkily; \"there's more truth than lies in\r\nmost of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" I sneered, \"does the Mayor of St. Gildas and St. Julien believe in\r\nthe loup-garou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not in the loup-garou.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what, then--Jeanne-la-Flamme?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Le Bihan with conviction, \"is history.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil it is!\" said I; \"and perhaps, Monsieur the mayor, your faith\r\nin giants is unimpaired?\"\r\n\r\n\"There were giants--everybody knows it,\" growled Max Fortin.\r\n\r\n\"And you a chemist!\" I observed scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Monsieur Darrel,\" squeaked Le Bihan; \"you know yourself that\r\nthe Purple Emperor was a scientific man. Now suppose I should tell you\r\nthat he always refused to include in his collection a Death's\r\nMessenger?\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"You know what I mean--that moth that flies by night; some call it the\r\nDeath's Head, but in St. Gildas we call it 'Death's Messenger.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said I, \"you mean that big sphinx moth that is commonly known as\r\nthe 'death's-head moth.' Why the mischief should the people here call it\r\ndeath's messenger?\"\r\n\r\n\"For hundreds of years it has been known as death's messenger in St.\r\nGildas,\" said Max Fortin. \"Even Froissart speaks of it in his\r\ncommentaries on Jacques Sorgue's _Chronicles_. The book is in your\r\nlibrary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorgue? And who was Jacques Sorgue? I never read his book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jacques Sorgue [Transcriber's note: the original reads \"Sorque\"] was the\r\nson of some unfrocked priest--I forget. It was during the crusades.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens!\" I burst out, \"I've been hearing of nothing but crusades\r\nand priests and death and sorcery ever since I kicked that skull into\r\nthe gravel pit, and I am tired of it, I tell you frankly. One would\r\nthink we lived in the dark ages. Do you know what year of our Lord it\r\nis, Le Bihan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen hundred and ninety-six,\" replied the mayor.\r\n\r\n\"And yet you two hulking men are afraid of a death's-head moth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care to have one fly into the window,\" said Max Fortin; \"it\r\nmeans evil to the house and the people in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"God alone knows why he marked one of his creatures with a yellow\r\ndeath's head on the back,\" observed Le Bihan piously, \"but I take it\r\nthat he meant it as a warning; and I propose to profit by it,\" he added\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Le Bihan,\" I said; \"by a stretch of imagination one can make\r\nout a skull on the thorax of a certain big sphinx moth. What of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a bad thing to touch,\" said the mayor wagging his head.\r\n\r\n\"It squeaks when handled,\" added Max Fortin.\r\n\r\n\"Some creatures squeak all the time,\" I observed, looking hard at Le\r\nBihan.\r\n\r\n\"Pigs,\" added the mayor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and asses,\" I replied. \"Listen, Le Bihan: do you mean to tell me\r\nthat you saw that skull roll uphill yesterday?\"\r\n\r\nThe mayor shut his mouth tightly and picked up his hammer.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be obstinate,\" I said; \"I asked you a question.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I refuse to answer,\" snapped Le Bihan. \"Fortin saw what I saw; let\r\nhim talk about it.\"\r\n\r\nI looked searchingly at the little chemist.\r\n\r\n\"I don't say that I saw it actually roll up out of the pit, all by\r\nitself,\" said Fortin with a shiver, \"but--but then, how did it come up\r\nout of the pit, if it didn't roll up all by itself?\"\r\n\r\n\"It didn't come up at all; that was a yellow cobblestone that you\r\nmistook for the skull again,\" I replied. \"You were nervous, Max.\"\r\n\r\n\"A--a very curious cobblestone, Monsieur Darrel,\" said Fortin.\r\n\r\n\"I also was a victim to the same hallucination,\" I continued, \"and I\r\nregret to say that I took the trouble to roll two innocent cobblestones\r\ninto the gravel pit, imagining each time that it was the skull I was\r\nrolling.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" observed Le Bihan with a morose shrug.\r\n\r\n\"It just shows,\" said I, ignoring the mayor's remark, \"how easy it is to\r\nfix up a train of coincidences so that the result seems to savor of the\r\nsupernatural. Now, last night my wife imagined that she saw a priest in\r\na mask peer in at her window----\"\r\n\r\nFortin and Le Bihan scrambled hastily from their knees, dropping hammer\r\nand nails.\r\n\r\n\"W-h-a-t--what's that?\" demanded the mayor.\r\n\r\nI repeated what I had said. Max Fortin turned livid.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" muttered Le Bihan, \"the Black Priest is in St. Gildas!\"\r\n\r\n\"D-don't you--you know the old prophecy?\" stammered Fortin; \"Froissart\r\nquotes it from Jacques Sorgue:\r\n\r\n    \"'When the Black Priest rises from the dead,\r\n    St. Gildas folk shall shriek in bed;\r\n    When the Black Priest rises from his grave,\r\n    May the good God St. Gildas save!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Aristide Le Bihan,\" I said angrily, \"and you, Max Fortin, I've got\r\nenough of this nonsense! Some foolish lout from Bannalec has been in St.\r\nGildas playing tricks to frighten old fools like you. If you have\r\nnothing better to talk about than nursery legends I'll wait until you\r\ncome to your senses. Good-morning.\" And I walked out, more disturbed\r\nthan I cared to acknowledge to myself.\r\n\r\nThe day had become misty and overcast. Heavy, wet clouds hung in the\r\neast. I heard the surf thundering against the cliffs, and the gray gulls\r\nsquealed as they tossed and turned high in the sky. The tide was\r\ncreeping across the river sands, higher, higher, and I saw the seaweed\r\nfloating on the beach, and the lancons springing from the foam, silvery\r\nthreadlike flashes in the gloom. Curlew were flying up the river in twos\r\nand threes; the timid sea swallows skimmed across the moors toward some\r\nquiet, lonely pool, safe from the coming tempest. In every hedge field\r\nbirds were gathering, huddling together, twittering restlessly.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the cliffs I sat down, resting my chin on my clenched\r\nhands. Already a vast curtain of rain, sweeping across the ocean miles\r\naway, hid the island of Groix. To the east, behind the white semaphore\r\non the hills, black clouds crowded up over the horizon. After a little\r\nthe thunder boomed, dull, distant, and slender skeins of lightning\r\nunraveled across the crest of the coming storm. Under the cliff at my\r\nfeet the surf rushed foaming over the shore, and the lancons jumped and\r\nskipped and quivered until they seemed to be but the reflections of the\r\nmeshed lightning.\r\n\r\nI turned to the east. It was raining over Groix, it was raining at\r\nSainte Barbe, it was raining now at the semaphore. High in the storm\r\nwhirl a few gulls pitched; a nearer cloud trailed veils of rain in its\r\nwake; the sky was spattered with lightning; the thunder boomed.\r\n\r\nAs I rose to go, a cold raindrop fell upon the back of my hand, and\r\nanother, and yet another on my face. I gave a last glance at the sea,\r\nwhere the waves were bursting into strange white shapes that seemed to\r\nfling out menacing arms toward me. Then something moved on the cliff,\r\nsomething black as the black rock it clutched--a filthy cormorant,\r\ncraning its hideous head at the sky.\r\n\r\nSlowly I plodded homeward across the somber moorland, where the gorse\r\nstems glimmered with a dull metallic green, and the heather, no longer\r\nviolet and purple, hung drenched and dun-colored among the dreary rocks.\r\nThe wet turf creaked under my heavy boots, the black-thorn scraped and\r\ngrated against knee and elbow. Over all lay a strange light, pallid,\r\nghastly, where the sea spray whirled across the landscape and drove into\r\nmy face until it grew numb with the cold. In broad bands, rank after\r\nrank, billow on billow, the rain burst out across the endless moors, and\r\nyet there was no wind to drive it at such a pace.\r\n\r\nLys stood at the door as I turned into the garden, motioning me to\r\nhasten; and then for the first time I became conscious that I was soaked\r\nto the skin.\r\n\r\n\"However in the world did you come to stay out when such a storm\r\nthreatened?\" she said. \"Oh, you are dripping! Go quickly and change; I\r\nhave laid your warm underwear on the bed, Dick.\"\r\n\r\nI kissed my wife, and went upstairs to change my dripping clothes for\r\nsomething more comfortable.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the morning room there was a driftwood fire on the\r\nhearth, and Lys sat in the chimney corner embroidering.\r\n\r\n\"Catherine tells me that the fishing fleet from Lorient is out. Do you\r\nthink they are in danger, dear?\" asked Lys, raising her blue eyes to\r\nmine as I entered.\r\n\r\n\"There is no wind, and there will be no sea,\" said I, looking out of the\r\nwindow. Far across the moor I could see the black cliffs looming in the\r\nmist.\r\n\r\n\"How it rains!\" murmured Lys; \"come to the fire, Dick.\"\r\n\r\nI threw myself on the fur rug, my hands in my pockets, my head on Lys's\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me a story,\" I said. \"I feel like a boy of ten.\"\r\n\r\nLys raised a finger to her scarlet lips. I always waited for her to do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"Will you be very still, then?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Still as death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Death,\" echoed a voice, very softly.\r\n\r\n\"Did you speak, Lys?\" I asked, turning so that I could see her face.\r\n\r\n\"No; did you, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who said 'death'?\" I asked, startled.\r\n\r\n\"Death,\" echoed a voice, softly.\r\n\r\nI sprang up and looked about. Lys rose too, her needles and embroidery\r\nfalling to the floor. She seemed about to faint, leaning heavily on me,\r\nand I led her to the window and opened it a little way to give her air.\r\nAs I did so the chain lightning split the zenith, the thunder crashed,\r\nand a sheet of rain swept into the room, driving with it something that\r\nfluttered--something that flapped, and squeaked, and beat upon the rug\r\nwith soft, moist wings.\r\n\r\nWe bent over it together, Lys clinging to me, and we saw that it was a\r\ndeath's-head moth drenched with rain.\r\n\r\nThe dark day passed slowly as we sat beside the fire, hand in hand, her\r\nhead against my breast, speaking of sorrow and mystery and death. For\r\nLys believed that there were things on earth that none might understand,\r\nthings that must be nameless forever and ever, until God rolls up the\r\nscroll of life and all is ended. We spoke of hope and fear and faith,\r\nand the mystery of the saints; we spoke of the beginning and the end, of\r\nthe shadow of sin, of omens, and of love. The moth still lay on the\r\nfloor quivering its somber wings in the warmth of the fire, the skull\r\nand ribs clearly etched upon its neck and body.\r\n\r\n\"If it is a messenger of death to this house,\" I said, \"why should we\r\nfear, Lys?\"\r\n\r\n\"Death should be welcome to those who love God,\" murmured Lys, and she\r\ndrew the cross from her breast and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\"The moth might die if I threw it out into the storm,\" I said after a\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Let it remain,\" sighed Lys.\r\n\r\nLate that night my wife lay sleeping, and I sat beside her bed and read\r\nin the Chronicle of Jacques Sorgue. I shaded the candle, but Lys grew\r\nrestless, and finally I took the book down into the morning room, where\r\nthe ashes of the fire rustled and whitened on the hearth.\r\n\r\nThe death's-head moth lay on the rug before the fire where I had left\r\nit. At first I thought it was dead, but when I looked closer I saw a\r\nlambent fire in its amber eyes. The straight white shadow it cast across\r\nthe floor wavered as the candle flickered.\r\n\r\nThe pages of the Chronicle of Jacques Sorgue were damp and sticky; the\r\nilluminated gold and blue initials left flakes of azure and gilt where\r\nmy hand brushed them.\r\n\r\n\"It is not paper at all; it is thin parchment,\" I said to myself; and I\r\nheld the discolored page close to the candle flame and read, translating\r\nlaboriously:\r\n\r\n\"I, Jacques Sorgue, saw all these things. And I saw the Black Mass\r\ncelebrated in the chapel of St. Gildas-on-the-Cliff. And it was said by\r\nthe Abbé Sorgue, my kinsman: for which deadly sin the apostate priest\r\nwas seized by the most noble Marquis of Plougastel and by him condemned\r\nto be burned with hot irons, until his seared soul quit its body and fly\r\nto its master the devil. But when the Black Priest lay in the crypt of\r\nPlougastel, his master Satan came at night and set him free, and carried\r\nhim across land and sea to Mahmoud, which is Soldan or Saladin. And I,\r\nJacques Sorgue, traveling afterward by sea, beheld with my own eyes my\r\nkinsman, the Black Priest of St. Gildas, borne along in the air upon a\r\nvast black wing, which was the wing of his master Satan. And this was\r\nseen also by two men of the crew.\"\r\n\r\nI turned the page. The wings of the moth on the floor began to quiver. I\r\nread on and on, my eyes blurring under the shifting candle flame. I read\r\nof battles and of saints, and I learned how the Great Soldan made his\r\npact with Satan, and then I came to the Sieur de Trevec, and read how he\r\nseized the Black Priest in the midst of Saladin's tents and carried him\r\naway and cut off his head first branding him on the forehead. \"And\r\nbefore he suffered,\" said the Chronicle, \"he cursed the Sieur de Trevec\r\nand his descendants, and he said he would surely return to St. Gildas.\r\n'For the violence you do to me, I will do violence to you. For the evil\r\nI suffer at your hands, I will work evil on you and your descendants.\r\nWoe to your children, Sieur de Trevec!'\" There was a whirr, a beating of\r\nstrong wings, and my candle flashed up as in a sudden breeze. A humming\r\nfilled the room; the great moth darted hither and thither, beating,\r\nbuzzing, on ceiling and wall. I flung down my book and stepped forward.\r\nNow it lay fluttering upon the window sill, and for a moment I had it\r\nunder my hand, but the thing squeaked and I shrank back. Then suddenly\r\nit darted across the candle flame; the light flared and went out, and at\r\nthe same moment a shadow moved in the darkness outside. I raised my eyes\r\nto the window. A masked face was peering in at me.\r\n\r\nQuick as thought I whipped out my revolver and fired every cartridge,\r\nbut the face advanced beyond the window, the glass melting away before\r\nit like mist, and through the smoke of my revolver I saw something creep\r\nswiftly into the room. Then I tried to cry out, but the thing was at my\r\nthroat, and I fell backward among the ashes of the hearth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen my eyes unclosed I was lying on the hearth, my head among the cold\r\nashes. Slowly I got on my knees, rose painfully, and groped my way to a\r\nchair. On the floor lay my revolver, shining in the pale light of early\r\nmorning. My mind clearing by degrees, I looked, shuddering, at the\r\nwindow. The glass was unbroken. I stooped stiffly, picked up my revolver\r\nand opened the cylinder. Every cartridge had been fired. Mechanically I\r\nclosed the cylinder and placed the revolver in my pocket. The book, the\r\nChronicles of Jacques Sorgue, lay on the table beside me, and as I\r\nstarted to close it I glanced at the page. It was all splashed with\r\nrain, and the lettering had run, so that the page was merely a confused\r\nblur of gold and red and black. As I stumbled toward the door I cast a\r\nfearful glance over my shoulder. The death's-head moth crawled shivering\r\non the rug.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe sun was about three hours high. I must have slept, for I was aroused\r\nby the sudden gallop of horses under our window. People were shouting\r\nand calling in the road. I sprang up and opened the sash. Le Bihan was\r\nthere, an image of helplessness, and Max Fortin stood beside him\r\npolishing his glasses. Some gendarmes had just arrived from Quimperle,\r\nand I could hear them around the corner of the house, stamping, and\r\nrattling their sabres and carbines, as they led their horses into my\r\nstable.\r\n\r\nLys sat up, murmuring half-sleepy, half-anxious questions.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I answered. \"I am going out to see what it means.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is like the day they came to arrest you,\" Lys said, giving me a\r\ntroubled look. But I kissed her and laughed at her until she smiled too.\r\nThen I flung on coat and cap and hurried down the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe first person I saw standing in the road was the Brigadier Durand.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" said I, \"have you come to arrest me again? What the devil is\r\nall this fuss about, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were telegraphed for an hour ago,\" said Durand briskly, \"and for a\r\nsufficient reason, I think. Look there, Monsieur Darrel!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the ground almost under my feet.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried, \"where did that puddle of blood come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I want to know, Monsieur Darrel. Max Fortin found it at\r\ndaybreak. See, it's splashed all over the grass, too. A trail of it\r\nleads into your garden, across the flower beds to your very window, the\r\none that opens from the morning room. There is another trail leading\r\nfrom this spot across the road to the cliffs, then to the gravel pit,\r\nand thence across the moor to the forest of Kerselec. We are going to\r\nmount in a minute and search the bosquets. Will you join us? Bon Dieu!\r\nbut the fellow bled like an ox. Max Fortin says it's human blood, or I\r\nshould not have believed it.\"\r\n\r\nThe little chemist of Quimperle came up at that moment, rubbing his\r\nglasses with a colored handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is human blood,\" he said, \"but one thing puzzles me: the\r\ncorpuscles are yellow. I never saw any human blood before with yellow\r\ncorpuscles. But your English Doctor Thompson asserts that he has----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's human blood, anyway--isn't it?\" insisted Durand,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Ye-es,\" admitted Max Fortin.\r\n\r\n\"Then it's my business to trail it,\" said the big gendarme, and he\r\ncalled his men and gave the order to mount.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear anything last night?\" asked Durand of me.\r\n\r\n\"I heard the rain. I wonder the rain did not wash away these traces.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must have come after the rain ceased. See this thick splash, how\r\nit lies over and weighs down the wet grass blades. Pah!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a heavy, evil-looking clot, and I stepped back from it, my throat\r\nclosing in disgust.\r\n\r\n\"My theory,\" said the brigadier, \"is this: Some of those Biribi\r\nfishermen, probably the Icelanders, got an extra glass of cognac into\r\ntheir hides and quarreled on the road. Some of them were slashed, and\r\nstaggered to your house. But there is only one trail, and yet--and yet,\r\nhow could all that blood come from only one person? Well, the wounded\r\nman, let us say, staggered first to your house and then back here, and\r\nhe wandered off, drunk and dying, God knows where. That's my theory.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very good one,\" said I calmly. \"And you are going to trail him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"At once. Will you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now. I'll gallop over by-and-bye. You are going to the edge of the\r\nKerselec forest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; you will hear us calling. Are you coming, Max Fortin? And you, Le\r\nBihan? Good; take the dog-cart.\"\r\n\r\nThe big gendarme tramped around the corner to the stable and presently\r\nreturned mounted on a strong gray horse, his sabre shone on his saddle;\r\nhis pale yellow and white facings were spotless. The little crowd of\r\nwhite-coiffed women with their children fell back as Durand touched\r\nspurs and clattered away followed by his two troopers. Soon after Le\r\nBihan and Max Fortin also departed in the mayor's dingy dog-cart.\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming?\" piped Le Bihan shrilly.\r\n\r\n\"In a quarter of an hour,\" I replied, and went back to the house.\r\n\r\nWhen I opened the door of the morning room the death's-head moth was\r\nbeating its strong wings against the window. For a second I hesitated,\r\nthen walked over and opened the sash. The creature fluttered out,\r\nwhirred over the flower beds a moment, then darted across the moorland\r\ntoward the sea. I called the servants together and questioned them.\r\nJosephine, Catherine, Jean Marie Tregunc, not one of them had heard the\r\nslightest disturbance during the night. Then I told Jean Marie to saddle\r\nmy horse, and while I was speaking Lys came down.\r\n\r\n\"Dearest,\" I began, going to her.\r\n\r\n\"You must tell me everything you know, Dick,\" she interrupted, looking\r\nme earnestly in the face.\r\n\r\n\"But there is nothing to tell--only a drunken brawl, and some one\r\nwounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are going to ride--where, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, over to the edge of Kerselec forest. Durand and the mayor, and\r\nMax Fortin, have gone on, following a--a trail.\"\r\n\r\n\"What trail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did they find it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out in the road there.\" Lys crossed herself.\r\n\r\n\"Does it come near our house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How near?\"\r\n\r\n\"It comes up to the morning room window,\" said I, giving in.\r\n\r\nHer hand on my arm grew heavy. \"I dreamed last night----\"\r\n\r\n\"So did I--\" but I thought of the empty cartridges in my revolver, and\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\"I dreamed that you were in great danger, and I could not move hand or\r\nfoot to save you; but you had your revolver, and I called out to you to\r\nfire----\"\r\n\r\n\"I did fire!\" I cried excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"You--you fired?\"\r\n\r\nI took her in my arms. \"My darling,\" I said \"something strange has\r\nhappened--something that I cannot understand as yet. But, of course,\r\nthere is an explanation. Last night I thought I fired at the Black\r\nPriest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" gasped Lys.\r\n\r\n\"Is that what you dreamed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, that was it! I begged you to fire----\"\r\n\r\n\"And I did.\"\r\n\r\nHer heart was beating against my breast. I held her close in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\" she said at length, \"perhaps you killed the--the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it was human I did not miss,\" I answered grimly. \"And it was human,\"\r\nI went on, pulling myself together, ashamed of having so nearly gone to\r\npieces. \"Of course it was human! The whole affair is plain enough. Not a\r\ndrunken brawl, as Durand thinks; it was a drunken lout's practical joke,\r\nfor which he has suffered. I suppose I must have filled him pretty full\r\nof bullets, and he has crawled away to die in Kerselec forest. It's a\r\nterrible affair; I'm sorry I fired so hastily; but that idiot Le Bihan\r\nand Max Fortin have been working on my nerves till I am as hysterical as\r\na schoolgirl,\" I ended angrily.\r\n\r\n\"You fired--but the window glass was not shattered,\" said Lys in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the window was open, then. And as for the--the rest--I've got\r\nnervous indigestion, and a doctor will settle the Black Priest for me,\r\nLys.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced out of the window at Tregunc waiting with my horse at the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n\"Dearest, I think I had better go to join Durand and the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Lys.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall suffer every moment you are away.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ride is too fatiguing, and we can't tell what unpleasant sight you\r\nmay come upon. Lys, you don't really think there is anything\r\nsupernatural in this affair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\" she answered gently, \"I am a Bretonne.\" With both arms around my\r\nneck, my wife said, \"Death is the gift of God. I do not fear it when we\r\nare together. But alone--oh, my husband, I should fear a God who could\r\ntake you away from me!\"\r\n\r\nWe kissed each other soberly, simply, like two children. Then Lys\r\nhurried away to change her gown, and I paced up and down the garden\r\nwaiting for her.\r\n\r\nShe came, drawing on her slender gauntlets. I swung her into the saddle,\r\ngave a hasty order to Jean Marie, and mounted.\r\n\r\nNow, to quail under thoughts of terror on a morning like this, with Lys\r\nin the saddle beside me, no matter what had happened or might happen\r\nwas impossible. Moreover, Môme came sneaking after us. I asked Tregunc\r\nto catch him, for I was afraid he might be brained by our horses' hoofs\r\nif he followed, but the wily puppy dodged and bolted after Lys, who was\r\ntrotting along the highroad. \"Never mind,\" I thought; \"if he's hit he'll\r\nlive, for he has no brains to lose.\"\r\n\r\nLys was waiting for me in the road beside the Shrine of Our Lady of St.\r\nGildas when I joined her. She crossed herself, I doffed my cap, then we\r\nshook out our bridles and galloped toward the forest of Kerselec.\r\n\r\nWe said very little as we rode. I always loved to watch Lys in the\r\nsaddle. Her exquisite figure and lovely face were the incarnation of\r\nyouth and grace; her curling hair glistened like threaded gold.\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw the spoiled puppy Môme come bounding\r\ncheerfully alongside, oblivious of our horses' heels. Our road swung\r\nclose to the cliffs. A filthy cormorant rose from the black rocks and\r\nflapped heavily across our path. Lys's horse reared, but she pulled him\r\ndown, and pointed at the bird with her riding crop.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said I; \"it seems to be going our way. Curious to see a\r\ncormorant in a forest, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a bad sign,\" said Lys. \"You know the Morbihan proverb: 'When the\r\ncormorant turns from the sea, Death laughs in the forest, and wise\r\nwoodsmen build boats.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said I sincerely, \"that there were fewer proverbs in\r\nBrittany.\"\r\n\r\nWe were in sight of the forest now; across the gorse I could see the\r\nsparkle of gendarmes' trappings, and the glitter of Le Bihan's\r\nsilver-buttoned jacket. The hedge was low and we took it without\r\ndifficulty, and trotted across the moor to where Le Bihan and Durand\r\nstood gesticulating.\r\n\r\nThey bowed ceremoniously to Lys as we rode up.\r\n\r\n\"The trail is horrible--it is a river,\" said the mayor in his squeaky\r\nvoice. \"Monsieur Darrel, I think perhaps madame would scarcely care to\r\ncome any nearer.\"\r\n\r\nLys drew bridle and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\"It is horrible!\" said Durand, walking up beside me; \"it looks as though\r\na bleeding regiment had passed this way. The trail winds and winds about\r\nhere in the thickets; we lose it at times, but we always find it again.\r\nI can't understand how one man--no, nor twenty--could bleed like that!\"\r\n\r\nA halloo, answered by another, sounded from the depths of the forest.\r\n\r\n\"It's my men; they are following the trail,\" muttered the brigadier.\r\n\"God alone knows what is at the end!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we gallop back, Lys?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No; let us ride along the western edge of the woods and dismount. The\r\nsun is so hot now, and I should like to rest for a moment,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"The western forest is clear of anything disagreeable,\" said Durand.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I answered; \"call me, Le Bihan, if you find anything.\"\r\n\r\nLys wheeled her mare, and I followed across the springy heather, Môme\r\ntrotting cheerfully in the rear.\r\n\r\nWe entered the sunny woods about a quarter of a kilometer from where we\r\nleft Durand. I took Lys from her horse, flung both bridles over a limb,\r\nand, giving my wife my arm, aided her to a flat mossy rock which\r\noverhung a shallow brook gurgling among the beech trees. Lys sat down\r\nand drew off her gauntlets. Môme pushed his head into her lap, received\r\nan undeserved caress, and came doubtfully toward me. I was weak enough\r\nto condone his offense, but I made him lie down at my feet, greatly to\r\nhis disgust.\r\n\r\nI rested my head on Lys's knees, looking up at the sky through the\r\ncrossed branches of the trees.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I have killed him,\" I said. \"It shocks me terribly, Lys.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could not have known, dear. He may have been a robber,\r\nand--if--not--did--have you ever fired your revolver since that day four\r\nyears ago when the Red Admiral's son tried to kill you? But I know you\r\nhave not.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I, wondering. \"It's a fact, I have not. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't you remember that I asked you to let me load it for you the\r\nday when Yves went off, swearing to kill you and his father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do remember. Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I--I took the cartridges first to St. Gildas chapel and dipped\r\nthem in holy water. You must not laugh, Dick,\" said Lys gently, laying\r\nher cool hands on my lips.\r\n\r\n\"Laugh, my darling!\"\r\n\r\nOverhead the October sky was pale amethyst, and the sunlight burned like\r\norange flame through the yellow leaves of beech and oak. Gnats and\r\nmidges danced and wavered overhead; a spider dropped from a twig halfway\r\nto the ground and hung suspended on the end of his gossamer thread.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sleepy, dear?\" asked Lys, bending over me.\r\n\r\n\"I am--a little; I scarcely slept two hours last night,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"You may sleep, if you wish,\" said Lys, and touched my eyes caressingly.\r\n\r\n\"Is my head heavy on your knees?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Dick.\"\r\n\r\nI was already in a half doze; still I heard the brook babbling under the\r\nbeeches and the humming of forest flies overhead. Presently even these\r\nwere stilled.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I knew I was sitting bolt upright, my ears ringing with a\r\nscream, and I saw Lys cowering beside me, covering her white face with\r\nboth hands.\r\n\r\nAs I sprang to my feet she cried again and clung to my knees. I saw my\r\ndog rush growling into a thicket, then I heard him whimper, and he came\r\nbacking out, whining, ears flat, tail down. I stooped and disengaged\r\nLys's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, Dick!\" she cried. \"O God, it's the Black Priest!\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment I had leaped across the brook and pushed my way into the\r\nthicket. It was empty. I stared about me; I scanned every tree trunk,\r\nevery bush. Suddenly I saw him. He was seated on a fallen log, his head\r\nresting in his hands, his rusty black robe gathered around him. For a\r\nmoment my hair stirred under my cap; sweat started on forehead and cheek\r\nbone; then I recovered my reason, and understood that the man was human\r\nand was probably wounded to death. Ay, to death; for there at my feet,\r\nlay the wet trail of blood, over leaves and stones, down into the little\r\nhollow, across to the figure in black resting silently under the trees.\r\n\r\nI saw that he could not escape even if he had the strength, for before\r\nhim, almost at his very feet, lay a deep, shining swamp.\r\n\r\nAs I stepped forward my foot broke a twig. At the sound the figure\r\nstarted a little, then its head fell forward again. Its face was masked.\r\nWalking up to the man, I bade him tell where he was wounded. Durand and\r\nthe others broke through the thicket at the same moment and hurried to\r\nmy side.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you who hide a masked face in a priest's robe?\" said the\r\ngendarme loudly.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n\"See--see the stiff blood all over his robe,\" muttered Le Bihan to\r\nFortin.\r\n\r\n\"He will not speak,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"He may be too badly wounded,\" whispered Le Bihan.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him raise his head,\" I said, \"my wife saw him creep up here.\"\r\n\r\nDurand stepped forward and touched the figure.\r\n\r\n\"Speak!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Speak!\" quavered Fortin.\r\n\r\nDurand waited a moment, then with a sudden upward movement he stripped\r\noff the mask and threw back the man's head. We were looking into the eye\r\nsockets of a skull. Durand stood rigid; the mayor shrieked. The skeleton\r\nburst out from its rotting robes and collapsed on the ground before us.\r\nFrom between the staring ribs and the grinning teeth spurted a torrent\r\nof black blood, showering the shrinking grasses; then the thing\r\nshuddered, and fell over into the black ooze of the bog. Little bubbles\r\nof iridescent air appeared from the mud; the bones were slowly engulfed,\r\nand, as the last fragments sank out of sight, up from the depths and\r\nalong the bank crept a creature, shiny, shivering, quivering its wings.\r\n\r\nIt was a death's-head moth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wish I had time to tell you how Lys outgrew superstitions--for she\r\nnever knew the truth about the affair, and she never will know, since\r\nshe has promised not to read this book. I wish I might tell you about\r\nthe king and his coronation, and how the coronation robe fitted. I wish\r\nthat I were able to write how Yvonne and Herbert Stuart rode to a boar\r\nhunt in Quimperle, and how the hounds raced the quarry right through the\r\ntown, overturning three gendarmes, the notary, and an old woman. But I\r\nam becoming garrulous and Lys is calling me to come and hear the king\r\nsay that he is sleepy. And his highness shall not be kept waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S CRADLE SONG\r\n\r\n      Seal with a seal of gold\r\n      The scroll of a life unrolled;\r\n    Swathe him deep in his purple stole;\r\n    Ashes of diamonds, crystalled coal,\r\n      Drops of gold in each scented fold.\r\n\r\n    Crimson wings of the Little Death,\r\n    Stir his hair with your silken breath;\r\n    Flaming wings of sins to be,\r\n    Splendid pinions of prophecy,\r\n      Smother his eyes with hues and dyes,\r\n    While the white moon spins and the winds arise,\r\n      And the stars drip through the skies.\r\n\r\n      Wave, O wings of the Little Death!\r\n      Seal his sight and stifle his breath,\r\n    Cover his breast with the gemmed shroud pressed;\r\n    From north to north, from west to west,\r\n      Wave, O wings of the Little Death!\r\n    Till the white moon reels in the cracking skies,\r\n      And the ghosts of God arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLazarus\r\n\r\nBY LEONID ANDREYEV\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY ABRAHAM YARMOLINSKY\r\n\r\n     From _Lazarus and the Gentleman from San Francisco_. Published by\r\n     The Stratford Company. By permission of the publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen Lazarus left the grave, where, for three days and three nights he\r\nhad been under the enigmatical sway of death, and returned alive to his\r\ndwelling, for a long time no one noticed in him those sinister oddities,\r\nwhich, as time went on, made his very name a terror. Gladdened\r\nunspeakably by the sight of him who had been returned to life, those\r\nnear to him caressed him unceasingly, and satiated their burning desire\r\nto serve him, in solicitude for his food and drink and garments. And\r\nthey dressed him gorgeously, in bright colors of hope and laughter, and\r\nwhen, like to a bridegroom in his bridal vestures, he sat again among\r\nthem at the table, and again ate and drank, they wept, overwhelmed with\r\ntenderness. And they summoned the neighbors to look at him who had risen\r\nmiraculously from the dead. These came and shared the serene joy of the\r\nhosts. Strangers from far-off towns and hamlets came and adored the\r\nmiracle in tempestuous words. Like to a beehive was the house of Mary\r\nand Martha.\r\n\r\nWhatever was found new in Lazarus' face and gestures was thought to be\r\nsome trace of a grave illness and of the shocks recently experienced.\r\nEvidently, the destruction wrought by death on the corpse was only\r\narrested by the miraculous power, but its effects were still apparent;\r\nand what death had succeeded in doing with Lazarus' face and body, was\r\nlike an artist's unfinished sketch seen under thin glass. On Lazarus'\r\ntemples, under his eyes, and in the hollows of his cheeks, lay a deep\r\nand cadaverous blueness; cadaverously blue also were his long fingers,\r\nand around his fingernails, grown long in the grave, the blue had become\r\npurple and dark. On his lips the skin, swollen in the grave, had burst\r\nin places, and thin, reddish cracks were formed, shining as though\r\ncovered with transparent mica. And he had grown stout. His body, puffed\r\nup in the grave, retained its monstrous size and showed those frightful\r\nswellings, in which one sensed the presence of the rank liquid of\r\ndecomposition. But the heavy corpse-like odor which penetrated Lazarus'\r\ngraveclothes and, it seemed, his very body, soon entirely disappeared,\r\nthe blue spots on his face and hands grew paler, and the reddish cracks\r\nclosed up, although they never disappeared altogether. That is how\r\nLazarus looked when he appeared before people, in his second life, but\r\nhis face looked natural to those who had seen him in the coffin.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the changes in his appearance, Lazarus' temper seemed to\r\nhave undergone a transformation, but this circumstance startled no one\r\nand attracted no attention. Before his death Lazarus had always been\r\ncheerful and carefree, fond of laughter and a merry joke. It was because\r\nof this brightness and cheerfulness, with not a touch of malice and\r\ndarkness, that the Master had grown so fond of him. But now Lazarus had\r\ngrown grave and taciturn, he never jested, himself, nor responded with\r\nlaughter to other people's jokes; and the words which he uttered, very\r\ninfrequently, were the plainest, most ordinary, and necessary words, as\r\ndeprived of depth and significance, as those sounds with which animals\r\nexpress pain and pleasure, thirst and hunger. They were the words that\r\none can say all one's life, and yet they give no indication of what\r\npains and gladdens the depths of the soul.\r\n\r\nThus, with the face of a corpse which for three days had been under the\r\nheavy sway of death, dark and taciturn, already appallingly transformed,\r\nbut still unrecognized by anyone in his new self, he was sitting at the\r\nfeasting table, among friends and relatives, and his gorgeous nuptial\r\ngarments glittered with yellow gold and bloody scarlet. Broad waves of\r\njubilation, now soft, now tempestuously sonorous surged around him; warm\r\nglances of love were reaching out for his face, still cold with the\r\ncoldness of the grave; and a friend's warm palm caressed his blue, heavy\r\nhand. And music played the tympanum and the pipe, the cithara and the\r\nharp. It was as though bees hummed, grasshoppers chirped and birds\r\nwarbled over the happy house of Mary and Martha.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOne of the guests incautiously lifted the veil. By a thoughtless word he\r\nbroke the serene charm and uncovered the truth in all its naked\r\nugliness. Ere the thought formed itself in his mind, his lips uttered\r\nwith a smile:\r\n\r\n\"Why dost thou not tell us what happened yonder?\"\r\n\r\nAnd all grew silent, startled by the question. It was as if it occurred\r\nto them only now that for three days Lazarus had been dead, and they\r\nlooked at him, anxiously awaiting his answer. But Lazarus kept silence.\r\n\r\n\"Thou dost not wish to tell us,\"--wondered the man, \"is it so terrible\r\nyonder?\"\r\n\r\nAnd again his thought came after his words. Had it been otherwise, he\r\nwould not have asked this question, which at that very moment oppressed\r\nhis heart with its insufferable horror. Uneasiness seized all present,\r\nand with a feeling of heavy weariness they awaited Lazarus' words, but\r\nhe was silent, sternly and coldly, and his eyes were lowered. And as if\r\nfor the first time, they noticed the frightful blueness of his face and\r\nhis repulsive obesity. On the table, as though forgotten by Lazarus,\r\nrested his bluish-purple wrist, and to this all eyes turned, as if it\r\nwere from it that the awaited answer was to come. The musicians were\r\nstill playing, but now the silence reached them too, and even as water\r\nextinguishes scattered embers, so were their merry tunes extinguished in\r\nthe silence. The pipe grew silent; the voices of the sonorous tympanum\r\nand the murmuring harp died away; and as if the strings had burst, the\r\ncithara answered with a tremulous, broken note. Silence.\r\n\r\n\"Thou dost not wish to say?\" repeated the guest, unable to check his\r\nchattering tongue. But the stillness remained unbroken, and the\r\nbluish-purple hand rested motionless. And then he stirred slightly and\r\neveryone felt relieved. He lifted up his eyes, and lo! straightway\r\nembracing everything in one heavy glance, fraught with weariness and\r\nhorror, he looked at them,--Lazarus who had arisen from the dead.\r\n\r\nIt was the third day since Lazarus had left the grave. Ever since then\r\nmany had experienced the pernicious power of his eye, but neither those\r\nwho were crushed by it forever, nor those who found the strength to\r\nresist in it the primordial sources of life,--which is as mysterious as\r\ndeath,--never could they explain the horror which lay motionless in the\r\ndepth of his black pupils. Lazarus looked calmly and simply with no\r\ndesire to conceal anything, but also with no intention to say anything;\r\nhe looked coldly, as he who is infinitely indifferent to those alive.\r\nMany carefree people came close to him without noticing him, and only\r\nlater did they learn with astonishment and fear who that calm stout man\r\nwas, that walked slowly by, almost touching them with his gorgeous and\r\ndazzling garments. The sun did not cease shining, when he was looking,\r\nnor did the fountain hush its murmur, and the sky overhead remained\r\ncloudless and blue. But the man under the spell of his enigmatical look\r\nheard no more the fountain and saw not the sky overhead. Sometimes, he\r\nwept bitterly, sometimes he tore his hair and in frenzy called for help;\r\nbut more often it came to pass that apathetically and quietly he began\r\nto die, and so he languished many years, before everybody's very eyes,\r\nwasted away, colorless, flabby, dull, like a tree, silently drying up in\r\na stony soil. And of those who gazed at him, the ones who wept madly,\r\nsometimes felt again the stir of life; the others never.\r\n\r\n\"So thou dost not wish to tell us what thou hast seen yonder?\" repeated\r\nthe man. But now his voice was impassive and dull, and deadly gray\r\nweariness showed in Lazarus' eyes. And deadly gray weariness covered\r\nlike dust all the faces, and with dull amazement the guests stared at\r\neach other and did not understand wherefore they had gathered here and\r\nsat at the rich table. The talk ceased. They thought it was time to go\r\nhome, but could not overcome the flaccid lazy weariness which glued\r\ntheir muscles, and they kept on sitting there, yet apart and torn away\r\nfrom each other, like pale fires scattered over a dark field.\r\n\r\nBut the musicians were paid to play and again they took their\r\ninstruments and again tunes full of studied mirth and studied sorrow\r\nbegan to flow and to rise. They unfolded the customary melody but the\r\nguests hearkened in dull amazement. Already they knew not wherefore is\r\nit necessary, and why is it well, that people should pluck strings,\r\ninflate their cheeks, blow in thin pipes, and produce a bizarre,\r\nmany-voiced noise.\r\n\r\n\"What bad music,\" said someone.\r\n\r\nThe musicians took offense and left. Following them, the guests left one\r\nafter another, for night was already come. And when placid darkness\r\nencircled them and they began to breathe with more ease, suddenly\r\nLazarus' image loomed up before each one in formidable radiance: the\r\nblue face of a corpse, grave-clothes gorgeous and resplendent, a cold\r\nlook, in the depths of which lay motionless an unknown horror. As though\r\npetrified, they were standing far apart, and darkness enveloped them,\r\nbut in the darkness blazed brighter and brighter the supernatural vision\r\nof him who for three days had been under the enigmatical sway of death.\r\nFor three days had he been dead: thrice had the sun risen and set, but\r\nhe had been dead; children had played, streams murmured over pebbles,\r\nthe wayfarer had lifted up hot dust in the highroad,--but he had been\r\ndead. And now he is again among them,--touches them,--looks at\r\nthem,--looks at them! and through the black discs of his pupils, as\r\nthrough darkened glass, stares the unknowable Yonder.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNo one was taking care of Lazarus, for no friends no relatives were left\r\nto him, and the great desert which encircled the holy city, came near\r\nthe very threshold of his dwelling. And the desert entered his house,\r\nand stretched on his couch, like a wife and extinguished the fires. No\r\none was taking care of Lazarus. One after the other, his sisters--Mary\r\nand Martha--forsook him. For a long while Martha was loath to abandon\r\nhim, for she knew not who would feed him and pity him, she wept and\r\nprayed. But one night, when the wind was roaming in the desert and with\r\na hissing sound the cypresses were bending over the roof, she dressed\r\nnoiselessly and secretly left the house. Lazarus probably heard the door\r\nslam; it banged against the side-post under the gusts of the desert\r\nwind, but he did not rise to go out and to look at her that was\r\nabandoning him. All the night long the cypresses hissed over his head\r\nand plaintively thumped the door, letting in the cold, greedy desert.\r\n\r\nLike a leper he was shunned by everyone, and it was proposed to tie a\r\nbell to his neck, as is done with lepers, to warn people against sudden\r\nmeetings. But someone remarked, growing frightfully pale, that it would\r\nbe too horrible if by night the moaning of Lazarus' bell were suddenly\r\nheard under the windows,--and so the project was abandoned.\r\n\r\nAnd since he did not take care of himself, he would probably have\r\nstarved to death, had not the neighbors brought him food in fear of\r\nsomething that they sensed but vaguely. The food was brought to him by\r\nchildren; they were not afraid of Lazarus, nor did they mock him with\r\nnaive cruelty, as children are wont to do with the wretched and\r\nmiserable. They were indifferent to him, and Lazarus answered them with\r\nthe same coldness; he had no desire to caress the black little curls,\r\nand to look into their innocent shining eyes. Given to Time and to the\r\nDesert, his house was crumbling down, and long since had his famishing,\r\nlowing goats wandered away to the neighboring pastures. And his bridal\r\ngarments became threadbare. Ever since that happy day, when the\r\nmusicians played, he had worn them unaware of the difference of the new\r\nand the worn. The bright colors grew dull and faded; vicious dogs and\r\nthe sharp thorn of the Desert turned the tender fabric into rags.\r\n\r\nBy day, when the merciless sun slew all things alive, and even scorpions\r\nsought shelter under stones and writhed there in a mad desire to sting,\r\nhe sat motionless under the sunrays, his blue face and the uncouth,\r\nbushy beard lifted up, bathing in the fiery flood.\r\n\r\nWhen people still talked to him, he was once asked:\r\n\r\n\"Poor Lazarus, does it please thee to sit thus and to stare at the\r\nsun?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he had answered:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it does.\"\r\n\r\nSo strong, it seemed, was the cold of his three days' grave, so deep the\r\ndarkness, that there was no heat on earth to warm Lazarus, nor a\r\nsplendor that could brighten the darkness of his eyes. That is what came\r\nto the mind of those who spoke to Lazarus, and with a sigh they left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd when the scarlet, flattened globe would lower, Lazarus would set out\r\nfor the desert and walk straight toward the sun, as though striving to\r\nreach it. He always walked straight toward the sun and those who tried\r\nto follow him and to spy upon what he was doing at night in the desert,\r\nretained in their memory the black silhouette of a tall stout man\r\nagainst the red background of an enormous flattened disc. Night pursued\r\nthem with her horrors, and so they did not learn of Lazarus' doings in\r\nthe desert, but the vision of the black on red was forever branded on\r\ntheir brain. Just as a beast with a splinter in its eye furiously rubs\r\nits muzzle with its paws, so they too foolishly rubbed their eyes, but\r\nwhat Lazarus had given was indelible, and Death alone could efface it.\r\n\r\nBut there were people who lived far away, who never saw Lazarus and knew\r\nof him only by report. With daring curiosity, which is stronger than\r\nfear and feeds upon it, with hidden mockery, they would come to Lazarus\r\nwho was sitting in the sun and enter into conversation with him. By\r\nthis time Lazarus' appearance had changed for the better and was not so\r\nterrible. The first minute they snapped their fingers and thought of how\r\nstupid the inhabitants of the holy city were; but when the short talk\r\nwas over and they started homeward, their looks were such that the\r\ninhabitants of the holy city recognized them at once and said:\r\n\r\n\"Look, there is one more fool on whom Lazarus has set his eye,\"--and\r\nthey shook their heads regretfully, and lifted up their arms.\r\n\r\nThere came brave, intrepid warriors, with tinkling weapons; happy youths\r\ncame with laughter and song; busy tradesmen, jingling their money, ran\r\nin for a moment, and haughty priests leaned their crosiers against\r\nLazarus' door, and they were all strangely changed, as they came back.\r\nThe same terrible shadow swooped down upon their souls and gave a new\r\nappearance to the old familiar world.\r\n\r\nThose who still had the desire to speak, expressed their feelings thus:\r\n\r\n\"All things tangible and visible grew hollow, light, and\r\ntransparent,--similar to lightsome shadows in the darkness of night;\r\n\r\n\"for, that great darkness, which holds the whole cosmos, was dispersed\r\nneither by the sun or by the moon and the stars, but like an immense\r\nblack shroud enveloped the earth and, like a mother, embraced it;\r\n\r\n\"it penetrated all the bodies, iron and stone,--and the particles of\r\nthe bodies, having lost their ties, grew lonely; and it penetrated into\r\nthe depth of the particles, and the particles of particles became\r\nlonely;\r\n\r\n\"for that great void, which encircles the cosmos, was not filled by\r\nthings visible: neither by the sun, nor by the moon and the stars, but\r\nreigned unrestrained, penetrating everywhere, severing body from body,\r\nparticle from particle;\r\n\r\n\"in the void hollow trees spread hollow roots threatening a fantastic\r\nfall; temples, palaces, and horses loomed up and they were hollow; and\r\nin the void men moved about restlessly but they were light and hollow\r\nlike shadows;\r\n\r\n\"for, Time was no more, and the beginning of all things came near their\r\nend: the building was still being built, and builders were still\r\nhammering away, and its ruins were already seen and the void in its\r\nplace; the man was still being born, but already funeral candles were\r\nburning at his head, and now they were extinguished, and there was the\r\nvoid in place of the man and of the funeral candles.\r\n\r\n\"and wrapped by void and darkness the man in despair trembled in the\r\nface of the Horror of the Infinite.\"\r\n\r\nThus spake the men who had still a desire to speak. But, surely, much\r\nmore could have told those who wished not to speak, and died in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAt that time there lived in Rome a renowned sculptor. In clay, marble,\r\nand bronze he wrought bodies of gods and men, and such was their beauty,\r\nthat people called them immortal. But he himself was discontented and\r\nasserted that there was something even more beautiful, that he could not\r\nembody either in marble or in bronze. \"I have not yet gathered the\r\nglimmers of the moon, nor have I my fill of sunshine,\" he was wont to\r\nsay, \"and there is no soul in my marble, no life in my beautiful\r\nbronze.\" And when on moonlit nights he slowly walked along the road,\r\ncrossing the black shadows of cypresses, his white tunic glittering in\r\nthe moonshine, those who met him would laugh in a friendly way and say:\r\n\r\n\"Art thou going to gather moonshine, Aurelius? Why then didst thou not\r\nfetch baskets?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he would answer, laughing and pointing to his eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Here are the baskets wherein I gather the sheen of the moon and the\r\nglimmer of the sun.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was: the moon glimmered in his eyes and the sun sparkled\r\ntherein. But he could not translate them into marble and therein lay the\r\nserene tragedy of his life.\r\n\r\nHe was descended from an ancient patrician race, had a good wife and\r\nchildren, and suffered from no want.\r\n\r\nWhen the obscure rumor about Lazarus reached him, he consulted his wife\r\nand friends and undertook the far journey to Judea to see him who had\r\nmiraculously risen from the dead. He was somewhat weary in those days\r\nand he hoped that the road would sharpen his blunted senses. What was\r\nsaid of Lazarus did not frighten him: he had pondered much over Death,\r\ndid not like it, but he disliked also those who confused it with life.\r\n\r\n    \"In this life,--life and beauty;\r\n    beyond,--Death, the enigmatical\"--\r\n\r\nthought he, and there is no better thing for a man to do than to delight\r\nin life and in the beauty of all things living. He had even a\r\nvainglorious desire to convince Lazarus of the truth of his own view and\r\nrestore his soul to life, as his body had been restored. This seemed so\r\nmuch easier because the rumors, shy and strange, did not render the\r\nwhole truth about Lazarus and but vaguely warned against something\r\nfrightful.\r\n\r\nLazarus had just risen from the stone in order to follow the sun which\r\nwas setting in the desert, when a rich Roman attended by an armed slave,\r\napproached him and addressed him in a sonorous tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\"Lazarus!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lazarus beheld a superb face, lit with glory, and arrayed in fine\r\nclothes, and precious stones sparkling in the sun. The red light lent to\r\nthe Roman's face and head the appearance of gleaming bronze--that also\r\nLazarus noticed. He resumed obediently his place and lowered his weary\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thou art ugly, my poor Lazarus,\"--quietly said the Roman, playing\r\nwith his golden chain; \"thou art even horrible, my poor friend; and\r\nDeath was not lazy that day when thou didst fall so heedlessly into his\r\nhands. But thou art stout, and, as the great Cæsar used to say, fat\r\npeople are not ill-tempered; to tell the truth, I don't understand why\r\nmen fear thee. Permit me to spend the night in thy house; the hour is\r\nlate, and I have no shelter.\"\r\n\r\nNever had anyone asked Lazarus' hospitality.\r\n\r\n\"I have no bed,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I am somewhat of a soldier and I can sleep sitting,\" the Roman\r\nanswered. \"We shall build a fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall have our talk in the darkness, like two friends. I think\r\nthou wilt find a bottle of wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no wine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Roman laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Now I see why thou art so somber and dislikest thy second life. No\r\nwine! Why, then we shall do without it: there are words that make the\r\nhead go round better than the Falernian.\"\r\n\r\nBy a sign he dismissed the slave, and they remained all alone. And again\r\nthe sculptor started speaking, but it was as if, together with the\r\nsetting sun, life had left his words; and they grew pale and hollow, as\r\nif they staggered on unsteady feet, as if they slipped and fell down,\r\ndrunk with the heavy lees of weariness and despair. And black chasms\r\ngrew up between the words--like far-off hints of the great void and the\r\ngreat darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Now I am thy guest, and thou wilt not be unkind to me, Lazarus!\"--said\r\nhe. \"Hospitality is the duty even of those who for three days were dead.\r\nThree days, I was told, thou didst rest in the grave. There it must be\r\ncold ... and that is whence comes thy ill habit of going without fire\r\nand wine. As to me, I like fire; it grows dark here so rapidly.... The\r\nlines of thy eyebrows and forehead are quite, quite interesting: they\r\nare like ruins of strange palaces, buried in ashes after an earthquake.\r\nBut why dost thou wear such ugly and queer garments? I have seen\r\nbridegrooms in thy country, and they wear such clothes--are they not\r\nfunny--and terrible.... But art thou a bridegroom?\"\r\n\r\nThe sun had already disappeared, a monstrous black shadow came running\r\nfrom the east--it was as if gigantic bare feet began rumbling on the\r\nsand, and the wind sent a cold wave along the backbone.\r\n\r\n\"In the darkness thou seemest still larger, Lazarus, as if thou hast\r\ngrown stouter in these moments. Dost thou feed on darkness, Lazarus? I\r\nwould fain have a little fire--at least a little fire, a little fire. I\r\nfeel somewhat chilly, your nights are so barbarously cold.... Were it\r\nnot so dark, I should say that thou wert looking at me, Lazarus. Yes, it\r\nseems to me, thou art looking.... Why, thou art looking at me, I feel\r\nit,--but there thou art smiling.\"\r\n\r\nNight came, and filled the air with heavy blackness.\r\n\r\n\"How well it will be, when the sun will rise to-morrow anew.... I am a\r\ngreat sculptor, thou knowest; that is how my friends call me. I create.\r\nYes, that is the word ... but I need daylight. I give life to the cold\r\nmarble, I melt sonorous bronze in fire, in bright hot fire.... Why didst\r\nthou touch me with thy hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come\"--said Lazarus--\"Thou art my guest.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they went to the house. And a long night enveloped the earth.\r\n\r\nThe slave, seeing that his master did not come, went to seek him, when\r\nthe sun was already high in the sky. And he beheld his master side by\r\nside with Lazarus: in profound silence were they sitting right under the\r\ndazzling and scorching sunrays and looking upward. The slave began to\r\nweep and cried out:\r\n\r\n\"My master, what has befallen thee, master?\"\r\n\r\nThe very same day the sculptor left for Rome. On the way Aurelius was\r\npensive and taciturn, staring attentively at everything--the men, the\r\nship, the sea, as though trying to retain something. On the high sea a\r\nstorm burst upon them, and all through it Aurelius stayed on the deck\r\nand eagerly scanned the seas looming near and sinking with a thud.\r\n\r\nAt home his friends were frightened at the change which had taken place\r\nin Aurelius, but he calmed them, saying meaningly:\r\n\r\n\"I have found it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd without changing the dusty clothes he wore on his journey, he fell\r\nto work, and the marble obediently resounded under his sonorous hammer.\r\nLong and eagerly worked he, admitting no one, until one morning he\r\nannounced that the work was ready and ordered his friends to be\r\nsummoned, severe critics and connoisseurs of art. And to meet them he\r\nput on bright and gorgeous garments, that glittered with yellow\r\ngold--and--scarlet byssus.\r\n\r\n\"Here is my work,\" said he thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nHis friends glanced and a shadow of profound sorrow covered their faces.\r\nIt was something monstrous, deprived of all the lines and shapes\r\nfamiliar to the eye, but not without a hint at some new, strange image.\r\n\r\nOn a thin, crooked twig, or rather on an ugly likeness of a twig rested\r\naskew a blind, ugly, shapeless, outspread mass of something utterly and\r\ninconceivably distorted, a mad leap of wild and bizarre fragments, all\r\nfeebly and vainly striving to part from one another. And, as if by\r\nchance, beneath one of the wildly-rent salients a butterfly was chiseled\r\nwith divine skill, all airy loveliness, delicacy, and beauty, with\r\ntransparent wings, which seemed to tremble with an impotent desire to\r\ntake flight.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore this wonderful butterfly, Aurelius?\" said somebody\r\nfalteringly.\r\n\r\n\"I know not\"--was the sculptor's answer.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary to tell the truth, and one of his friends who loved\r\nhim best said firmly:\r\n\r\n\"This is ugly, my poor friend. It must be destroyed. Give me the\r\nhammer.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with two strokes he broke the monstrous man into pieces, leaving\r\nonly the infinitely delicate butterfly untouched.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on Aurelius created nothing. With profound indifference\r\nhe looked at marble and bronze, and on his former divine works, where\r\neverlasting beauty rested. With the purpose of arousing his former\r\nfervent passion for work and, awakening his deadened soul, his friends\r\ntook him to see other artists' beautiful works,--but he remained\r\nindifferent as before, and the smile did not warm up his tightened lips.\r\nAnd only after listening to lengthy talks about beauty, he would retort\r\nwearily and indolently:\r\n\r\n\"But all this is a lie.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by the day, when the sun was shining, he went into his magnificent,\r\nskilfully built garden and having found a place without shadow, he\r\nexposed his bare head to the glare and heat. Red and white butterflies\r\nfluttered around; from the crooked lips of a drunken satyr, water\r\nstreamed down with a splash into a marble cistern, but he sat\r\nmotionless and silent,--like a pallid reflection of him who, in the\r\nfar-off distance, at the very gates of the stony desert, sat under the\r\nfiery sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAnd now it came to pass that the great, deified Augustus himself\r\nsummoned Lazarus. The imperial messengers dressed him gorgeously, in\r\nsolemn nuptial clothes, as if Time had legalized them, and he was to\r\nremain until his very death the bridegroom of an unknown bride. It was\r\nas though an old, rotting coffin had been gilt and furnished with new,\r\ngay tassels. And men, all in trim and bright attire, rode after him, as\r\nif in bridal procession indeed, and those foremost trumpeted loudly,\r\nbidding people to clear the way for the emperor's messengers. But\r\nLazarus' way was deserted: his native land cursed the hateful name of\r\nhim who had miraculously risen from the dead, and people scattered at\r\nthe very news of his appalling approach. The solitary voice of the brass\r\ntrumpets sounded in the motionless air, and the wilderness alone\r\nresponded with its languid echo.\r\n\r\nThen Lazarus went by sea. And his was the most magnificently arrayed and\r\nthe most mournful ship that ever mirrored itself in the azure waves of\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea. Many were the travelers aboard, but like a tomb\r\nwas the ship, all silence and stillness, and the despairing water sobbed\r\nat the steep, proudly curved prow. All alone sat Lazarus exposing his\r\nhead to the blaze of the sun, silently listening to the murmur and\r\nsplash of the wavelets, and afar seamen and messengers were sitting, a\r\nvague group of weary shadows. Had the thunder burst and the wind\r\nattacked the red sails, the ships would probably have perished, for none\r\nof those aboard had either the will or the strength to struggle for\r\nlife. With a supreme effort some mariners would reach the board and\r\neagerly scan the blue, transparent deep, hoping to see a naiad's pink\r\nshoulder flash in the hollow of an azure wave, or a drunken gay centaur\r\ndash along and in frenzy splash the wave with his hoof. But the sea was\r\nlike a wilderness, and the deep was dumb and deserted.\r\n\r\nWith utter indifference did Lazarus set his feet on the street of the\r\neternal city. As though all her wealth, all the magnificence of her\r\npalaces built by giants, all the resplendence, beauty, and music of her\r\nrefined life were but the echo of the wind in the wilderness, the\r\nreflection of the desert quicksand. Chariots were dashing, and along the\r\nstreets were moving crowds of strong, fair, proud builders of the\r\neternal city and haughty participants in her life; a song sounded;\r\nfountains and women laughed a pearly laughter; drunken philosophers\r\nharangued, and the sober listened to them with a smile; hoofs struck the\r\nstone pavements. And surrounded by cheerful noise, a stout, heavy man\r\nwas moving, a cold spot of silence and despair, and on his way he sowed\r\ndisgust, anger, and vague, gnawing weariness. Who dares to be sad in\r\nRome, wondered indignantly the citizens, and frowned. In two days the\r\nentire city already knew all about him who had miraculously risen from\r\nthe dead, and shunned him shyly.\r\n\r\nBut some daring people there were, who wanted to test their strength,\r\nand Lazarus obeyed their imprudent summons. Kept busy by state affairs,\r\nthe emperor constantly delayed the reception, and seven days did he who\r\nhad risen from the dead go about visiting others.\r\n\r\nAnd Lazarus came to a cheerful Epicurean, and the host met him with\r\nlaughter on his lips:\r\n\r\n\"Drink, Lazarus, drink!\"--shouted he. \"Would not Augustus laugh to see\r\nthee drunk!\"\r\n\r\nAnd half-naked drunken women laughed, and rose petals fell on Lazarus'\r\nblue hands. But then the Epicurean looked into Lazarus' eyes, and his\r\ngaiety ended forever. Drunkard remained he for the rest of his life;\r\nnever did he drink, yet forever was he drunk. But instead of the gay\r\nreverie which wine brings with it, frightful dreams began to haunt him,\r\nthe sole food of his stricken spirit. Day and night he lived in the\r\npoisonous vapors of his nightmares, and death itself was not more\r\nfrightful than her raving, monstrous forerunners.\r\n\r\nAnd Lazarus came to a youth and his beloved, who loved each other and\r\nwere most beautiful in their passions. Proudly and strongly embracing\r\nhis love, the youth said with serene regret:\r\n\r\n\"Look at us, Lazarus, and share our joy. Is there anything stronger\r\nthan love?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lazarus looked. And for the rest of their life they kept on loving\r\neach other, but their passion grew gloomy and joyless, like those\r\nfuneral cypresses whose roots feed on the decay of the graves and whose\r\nblack summits in a still evening hour seek in vain to reach the sky.\r\nThrown by the unknown forces of life into each other's embraces, they\r\nmingled tears with kisses, voluptuous pleasures with pain, and they felt\r\nthemselves doubly slaves, obedient slaves to life, and patient servants\r\nof the silent Nothingness. Ever united, ever severed, they blazed like\r\nsparks and like sparks lost themselves in the boundless Dark.\r\n\r\nAnd Lazarus came to a haughty sage, and the sage said to him:\r\n\r\n\"I know all the horrors thou canst reveal to me. Is there anything thou\r\ncanst frighten me with?\"\r\n\r\nBut before long the sage felt that the knowledge of horror was far from\r\nbeing the horror itself, and that the vision of Death, was not Death.\r\nAnd he felt that wisdom and folly are equal before the face of Infinity,\r\nfor Infinity knows them not. And it vanished, the dividing-line between\r\nknowledge and ignorance, truth and falsehood, top and bottom, and the\r\nshapeless thought hung suspended in the void. Then the sage clutched his\r\ngray head and cried out frantically:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think! I cannot think!\"\r\n\r\nThus under the indifferent glance for him, who miraculously had risen\r\nfrom the dead, perished everything that asserts life, its significance\r\nand joys. And it was suggested that it was dangerous to let him see the\r\nemperor, that it was better to kill him and, having buried him secretly,\r\nto tell the emperor that he had disappeared no one knew whither. Already\r\nswords were being whetted and youths devoted to the public welfare\r\nprepared for the murder, when Augustus ordered Lazarus to be brought\r\nbefore him next morning, thus destroying the cruel plans.\r\n\r\nIf there was no way of getting rid of Lazarus, at least it was possible\r\nto soften the terrible impression his face produced. With this in view,\r\nskillful painters, barbers, and artists were summoned, and all night\r\nlong they were busy over Lazarus' head. They cropped his beard, curled\r\nit, and gave it a tidy, agreeable appearance. By means of paints they\r\nconcealed the corpse-like blueness of his hands and face. Repulsive were\r\nthe wrinkles of suffering that furrowed his old face, and they were\r\nputtied, painted, and smoothed; then, over the smooth background,\r\nwrinkles of good-tempered laughter and pleasant, carefree mirth were\r\nskillfully painted with fine brushes.\r\n\r\nLazarus submitted indifferently to everything that was done to him. Soon\r\nhe was turned into a becomingly stout, venerable old man, into a quiet\r\nand kind grandfather of numerous offspring. It seemed that the smile,\r\nwith which only a while ago he was spinning funny yarns, was still\r\nlingering on his lips, and that in the corner of his eye serene\r\ntenderness was hiding, the companion of old age. But people did not dare\r\nchange his nuptial garments, and they could not change his eyes, two\r\ndark and frightful glasses through which looked at men, the unknowable\r\nYonder.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nLazarus was not moved by the magnificence of the imperial palace. It was\r\nas though he saw no difference between the crumbling house, closely\r\npressed by the desert, and the stone palace, solid and fair, and\r\nindifferently he passed into it. And the hard marble of the floors under\r\nhis feet grew similar to the quicksand of the desert, and the multitude\r\nof richly dressed and haughty men became like void air under his glance.\r\nNo one looked into his face, as Lazarus passed by, fearing to fall under\r\nthe appalling influence of his eyes; but when the sound of his heavy\r\nfootsteps had sufficiently died down, the courtiers raised their heads\r\nand with fearful curiosity examined the figure of a stout, tall,\r\nslightly bent old man, who was slowly penetrating into the very heart of\r\nthe imperial palace. Were Death itself passing, it would be faced with\r\nno greater fear: for until then the dead alone knew Death, and those\r\nalive knew Life only--and there was no bridge between them. But this\r\nextraordinary man, although alive, knew Death, and enigmatical,\r\nappalling, was his cursed knowledge. \"Woe,\" people thought, \"he will\r\ntake the life of our great, deified Augustus,\" and they sent curses\r\nafter Lazarus, who meanwhile kept on advancing into the interior of the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nAlready did the emperor know who Lazarus was, and prepared to meet him.\r\nBut the monarch was a brave man, and felt his own tremendous,\r\nunconquerable power, and in his fatal duel with him who had miraculously\r\nrisen from the dead he wanted not to invoke human help. And so he met\r\nLazarus face to face:\r\n\r\n\"Lift not thine eyes upon me, Lazarus,\" he ordered. \"I heard thy face is\r\nlike that of Medusa and turns into stone whomsoever thou lookest at.\r\nNow, I wish to see thee and to have a talk with thee, before I turn into\r\nstone,\"--added he in a tone of kingly jesting, not devoid of fear.\r\n\r\nComing close to him, he carefully examined Lazarus' face and his strange\r\nfestal garments. And although he had a keen eye, he was deceived by his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\"So. Thou dost not appear terrible, my venerable old man. But the worse\r\nfor us, if horror assumes such a respectable and pleasant air. Now let\r\nus have a talk.\"\r\n\r\nAugustus sat, and questioning Lazarus with his eye as much as with\r\nwords, started the conversation:\r\n\r\n\"Why didst thou not greet me as thou enteredst?\"\r\n\r\nLazarus answered indifferent:\r\n\r\n\"I knew not it was necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Art thou a Christian?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nAugustus approvingly shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"That is good. I do not like Christians. They shake the tree of life\r\nbefore it is covered with fruit, and disperse its odorous bloom to the\r\nwinds. But who art thou?\"\r\n\r\nWith a visible effort Lazarus answered:\r\n\r\n\"I was dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had heard that. But who art thou now?\"\r\n\r\nLazarus was silent, but at last repeated in a tone of weary apathy:\r\n\r\n\"I was dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, stranger,\" said the emperor, distinctly and severely\r\ngiving utterance to the thought that had come to him at the beginning,\r\n\"my realm is the realm of Life, my people are of the living, not of the\r\ndead. Thou art here one too many. I know not who thou art and what thou\r\nsawest there; but, if thou liest, I hate thy lies, and if thou tellst\r\nthe truth, I hate thy truth. In my bosom I feel the throb of life; I\r\nfeel strength in my arm, and my proud thoughts, like eagles, pierce the\r\nspace. And yonder in the shelter of my rule, under the protection of\r\nlaws created by me, people live and toil and rejoice. Dost thou hear the\r\nbattle-cry, the challenge men throw into the face of the future?\"\r\n\r\nAugustus, as in prayer, stretched forth his arms and exclaimed\r\nsolemnly:\r\n\r\n\"Be blessed, O great and divine Life!\"\r\n\r\nLazarus was silent, and with growing sternness the emperor went on:\r\n\r\n\"Thou art not wanted here, miserable remnant, snatched from under\r\nDeath's teeth, thou inspirest weariness and disgust with life; like a\r\ncaterpillar in the fields, thou gloatest on the rich ear of joy and\r\nbelchest out the drivel of despair and sorrow. Thy truth is like a rusty\r\nsword in the hands of a nightly murderer,--and as a murderer thou shalt\r\nbe executed. But before that, let me look into thine eyes. Perchance,\r\nonly cowards are afraid of them, but in the brave they awake the thirst\r\nfor strife and victory; then thou shalt be rewarded, not executed....\r\nNow, look at me, Lazarus.\"\r\n\r\nAt first it appeared to the deified Augustus that a friend was looking\r\nat him,--so soft, so tenderly fascinating was Lazarus' glance. It\r\npromised not horror, but sweet rest and the Infinite seemed to him a\r\ntender mistress, a compassionate sister, a mother. But stronger and\r\nstronger grew its embraces, and already the mouth, greedy of hissing\r\nkisses, interfered with the monarch's breathing, and already to the\r\nsurface of the soft tissues of the body came the iron of the bones and\r\ntightened its merciless circle,--and unknown fangs, blunt and cold,\r\ntouched his heart and sank into it with slow indolence.\r\n\r\n\"It pains,\" said the deified Augustus, growing pale. \"But look at me,\r\nLazarus, look.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as though some heavy gates, ever closed, were slowly moving\r\napart, and through the growing interstice the appalling horror of the\r\nInfinite poured in slowly and steadily. Like two shadows there entered\r\nthe shoreless void and the unfathomable darkness; they extinguished the\r\nsun, ravished the earth from under the feet, and the roof from over the\r\nhead. No more did the frozen heart ache.\r\n\r\n\"Look, look, Lazarus,\" ordered Augustus tottering.\r\n\r\nTime stood still, and the beginning of each thing grew frightfully near\r\nto its end. Augustus' throne just erected, crumbled down, and the void\r\nwas already in the place of the throne and of Augustus. Noiselessly did\r\nRome crumble down, and a new city stood on its site and it too was\r\nswallowed by the void. Like fantastic giants, cities, states, and\r\ncountries fell down and vanished in the void darkness--and with\r\nuttermost indifference did the insatiable black womb of the Infinite\r\nswallow them.\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\"--ordered the emperor.\r\n\r\nIn his voice sounded already a note of indifference, his hands dropped\r\nin languor, and in the vain struggle with the onrushing darkness his\r\nfiery eyes now blazed up, and now went out.\r\n\r\n\"My life thou hast taken from me, Lazarus,\"--said he in a spiritless,\r\nfeeble voice.\r\n\r\nAnd these words of hopelessness saved him. He remembered his people,\r\nwhose shield he was destined to be, and keen salutary pain pierced his\r\ndeadened heart. \"They are doomed to death,\" he thought wearily. \"Serene\r\nshadows in the darkness of the Infinite,\" thought he, and horror grew\r\nupon him. \"Frail vessels with living seething blood with a heart that\r\nknows sorrow and also great joy,\" said he in his heart, and tenderness\r\npervaded it.\r\n\r\nThus pondering and oscillating between the poles of Life and Death, he\r\nslowly came back to life, to find in its suffering and in its joys a\r\nshield against the darkness of the void and the horror of the Infinite.\r\n\r\n\"No, thou hast not murdered me, Lazarus,\" said he firmly, \"but I will\r\ntake thy life. Be gone.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening the deified Augustus partook of his meats and drinks with\r\nparticular joy. Now and then his lifted hand remained suspended in the\r\nair, and a dull glimmer replaced the bright sheen of his fiery eye. It\r\nwas the cold wave of Horror that surged at his feet. Defeated, but not\r\nundone, ever awaiting its hour, that Horror stood at the emperor's\r\nbedside, like a black shadow all through his life; it swayed his nights,\r\nbut yielded the days to the sorrows and joys of life.\r\n\r\nThe following day, the hangman with a hot iron burned out Lazarus' eyes.\r\nThen he was sent home. The deified Augustus dared not kill him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLazarus returned to the desert, and the wilderness met him with hissing\r\ngusts of wind and the heat of the blazing sun. Again he was sitting on a\r\nstone, his rough, bushy beard lifted up; and the two black holes in\r\nplace of his eyes looked at the sky with an expression of dull terror.\r\nAfar-off the holy city stirred noisily and restlessly, but around him\r\neverything was deserted and dumb. No one approached the place where\r\nlived he who had miraculously risen from the dead, and long since his\r\nneighbors had forsaken their houses. Driven by the hot iron into the\r\ndepth of his skull, his cursed knowledge hid there in an ambush. As\r\nthough leaping out from an ambush it plunged its thousand invisible eyes\r\ninto the man,--and no one dared look at Lazarus.\r\n\r\nAnd in the evening, when the sun, reddening and growing wider, would\r\ncome nearer and nearer the western horizon, the blind Lazarus would\r\nslowly follow it. He would stumble against stones and fall, stout and\r\nweak as he was; would rise heavily to his feet and walk on again; and on\r\nthe red screen of the sunset his black body and outspread hands would\r\nform a monstrous likeness of a cross.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass that once he went out and did not come back. Thus\r\nseemingly ended the second life of him who for three days had been under\r\nthe enigmatical sway of death, and rose miraculously from the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beast with Five Fingers\r\n\r\nBY W.F. HARVEY\r\n\r\n     From _The New Decameron_, by Various Hands. Copyright, 1919, by\r\n     Robert M. McBride and Company. By permission of the publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was a little boy I once went with my father to call on Adrian\r\nBorlsover. I played on the floor with a black spaniel while my father\r\nappealed for a subscription. Just before we left my father said, \"Mr.\r\nBorlsover, may my son here shake hands with you? It will be a thing to\r\nlook back upon with pride when he grows to be a man.\"\r\n\r\nI came up to the bed on which the old man was lying and put my hand in\r\nhis, awed by the still beauty of his face. He spoke to me kindly, and\r\nhoped that I should always try to please my father. Then he placed his\r\nright hand on my head and asked for a blessing to rest upon me. \"Amen!\"\r\nsaid my father, and I followed him out of the room, feeling as if I\r\nwanted to cry. But my father was in excellent spirits.\r\n\r\n\"That old gentleman, Jim,\" said he, \"is the most wonderful man in the\r\nwhole town. For ten years he has been quite blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I saw his eyes,\" I said. \"They were ever so black and shiny; they\r\nweren't shut up like Nora's puppies. Can't he see at all?\"\r\n\r\nAnd so I learnt for the first time that a man might have eyes that\r\nlooked dark and beautiful and shining without being able to see.\r\n\r\n\"Just like Mrs. Tomlinson has big ears,\" I said, \"and can't hear at all\r\nexcept when Mr. Tomlinson shouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jim,\" said my father, \"it's not right to talk about a lady's ears.\r\nRemember what Mr. Borlsover said about pleasing me and being a good\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the only time I saw Adrian Borlsover. I soon forgot about him\r\nand the hand which he laid in blessing on my head. But for a week I\r\nprayed that those dark tender eyes might see.\r\n\r\n\"His spaniel may have puppies,\" I said in my prayers, \"and he will never\r\nbe able to know how funny they look with their eyes all closed up.\r\nPlease let old Mr. Borlsover see.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAdrian Borlsover, as my father had said, was a wonderful man. He came of\r\nan eccentric family. Borlsovers' sons, for some reason, always seemed to\r\nmarry very ordinary women, which perhaps accounted for the fact that no\r\nBorlsover had been a genius, and only one Borlsover had been mad. But\r\nthey were great champions of little causes, generous patrons of odd\r\nsciences, founders of querulous sects, trustworthy guides to the bypath\r\nmeadows of erudition.\r\n\r\nAdrian was an authority on the fertilization of orchids. He had held at\r\none time the family living at Borlsover Conyers, until a congenital\r\nweakness of the lungs obliged him to seek a less rigorous climate in the\r\nsunny south coast watering-place where I had seen him. Occasionally he\r\nwould relieve one or other of the local clergy. My father described him\r\nas a fine preacher, who gave long and inspiring sermons from what many\r\nmen would have considered unprofitable texts. \"An excellent proof,\" he\r\nwould add, \"of the truth of the doctrine of direct verbal inspiration.\"\r\n\r\nAdrian Borlsover was exceedingly clever with his hands. His penmanship\r\nwas exquisite. He illustrated all his scientific papers, made his own\r\nwoodcuts, and carved the reredos that is at present the chief feature of\r\ninterest in the church at Borlsover Conyers. He had an exceedingly\r\nclever knack in cutting silhouettes for young ladies and paper pigs and\r\ncows for little children, and made more than one complicated wind\r\ninstrument of his own devising.\r\n\r\nWhen he was fifty years old Adrian Borlsover lost his sight. In a\r\nwonderfully short time he had adapted himself to the new conditions of\r\nlife. He quickly learned to read Braille. So marvelous indeed was his\r\nsense of touch that he was still able to maintain his interest in\r\nbotany. The mere passing of his long supple fingers over a flower was\r\nsufficient means for its identification, though occasionally he would\r\nuse his lips. I have found several letters of his among my father's\r\ncorrespondence. In no case was there anything to show that he was\r\nafflicted with blindness and this in spite of the fact that he exercised\r\nundue economy in the spacing of lines. Towards the close of his life the\r\nold man was credited with powers of touch that seemed almost uncanny: it\r\nhas been said that he could tell at once the color of a ribbon placed\r\nbetween his fingers. My father would neither confirm nor deny the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAdrian Borlsover was a bachelor. His elder brother George had married\r\nlate in life, leaving one son, Eustace, who lived in the gloomy Georgian\r\nmansion at Borlsover Conyers, where he could work undisturbed in\r\ncollecting material for his great book on heredity.\r\n\r\nLike his uncle, he was a remarkable man. The Borlsovers had always been\r\nborn naturalists, but Eustace possessed in a special degree the power of\r\nsystematizing his knowledge. He had received his university education in\r\nGermany, and then, after post-graduate work in Vienna and Naples, had\r\ntraveled for four years in South America and the East, getting together\r\na huge store of material for a new study into the processes of\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nHe lived alone at Borlsover Conyers with Saunders his secretary, a man\r\nwho bore a somewhat dubious reputation in the district, but whose\r\npowers as a mathematician, combined with his business abilities, were\r\ninvaluable to Eustace.\r\n\r\nUncle and nephew saw little of each other. The visits of Eustace were\r\nconfined to a week in the summer or autumn: long weeks, that dragged\r\nalmost as slowly as the bath-chair in which the old man was drawn along\r\nthe sunny sea front. In their way the two men were fond of each other,\r\nthough their intimacy would doubtless have been greater had they shared\r\nthe same religious views. Adrian held to the old-fashioned evangelical\r\ndogmas of his early manhood; his nephew for many years had been thinking\r\nof embracing Buddhism. Both men possessed, too, the reticence the\r\nBorlsovers had always shown, and which their enemies sometimes called\r\nhypocrisy. With Adrian it was a reticence as to the things he had left\r\nundone; but with Eustace it seemed that the curtain which he was so\r\ncareful to leave undrawn hid something more than a half-empty chamber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo years before his death Adrian Borlsover developed, unknown to\r\nhimself, the not uncommon power of automatic writing. Eustace made the\r\ndiscovery by accident. Adrian was sitting reading in bed, the forefinger\r\nof his left hand tracing the Braille characters, when his nephew noticed\r\nthat a pencil the old man held in his right hand was moving slowly along\r\nthe opposite page. He left his seat in the window and sat down beside\r\nthe bed. The right hand continued to move, and now he could see plainly\r\nthat they were letters and words which it was forming.\r\n\r\n\"Adrian Borlsover,\" wrote the hand, \"Eustace Borlsover, George\r\nBorlsover, Francis Borlsover Sigismund Borlsover, Adrian Borlsover,\r\nEustace Borlsover, Saville Borlsover. B, for Borlsover. Honesty is the\r\nBest Policy. Beautiful Belinda Borlsover.\"\r\n\r\n\"What curious nonsense!\" said Eustace to himself.\r\n\r\n\"King George the Third ascended the throne in 1760,\" wrote the hand.\r\n\"Crowd, a noun of multitude; a collection of individuals--Adrian\r\nBorlsover, Eustace Borlsover.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said his uncle, closing the book, \"that you had much\r\nbetter make the most of the afternoon sunshine and take your walk now.\"\r\n\"I think perhaps I will,\" Eustace answered as he picked up the volume.\r\n\"I won't go far, and when I come back I can read to you those articles\r\nin _Nature_ about which we were speaking.\"\r\n\r\nHe went along the promenade, but stopped at the first shelter, and\r\nseating himself in the corner best protected from the wind, he examined\r\nthe book at leisure. Nearly every page was scored with a meaningless\r\njungle of pencil marks: rows of capital letters, short words, long\r\nwords, complete sentences, copy-book tags. The whole thing, in fact, had\r\nthe appearance of a copy-book, and on a more careful scrutiny Eustace\r\nthought that there was ample evidence to show that the handwriting at\r\nthe beginning of the book, good though it was was not nearly so good as\r\nthe handwriting at the end.\r\n\r\nHe left his uncle at the end of October, with a promise to return early\r\nin December. It seemed to him quite clear that the old man's power of\r\nautomatic writing was developing rapidly, and for the first time he\r\nlooked forward to a visit that combined duty with interest.\r\n\r\nBut on his return he was at first disappointed. His uncle, he thought,\r\nlooked older. He was listless too, preferring others to read to him and\r\ndictating nearly all his letters. Not until the day before he left had\r\nEustace an opportunity of observing Adrian Borlsover's new-found\r\nfaculty.\r\n\r\nThe old man, propped up in bed with pillows, had sunk into a light\r\nsleep. His two hands lay on the coverlet, his left hand tightly clasping\r\nhis right. Eustace took an empty manuscript book and placed a pencil\r\nwithin reach of the fingers of the right hand. They snatched at it\r\neagerly; then dropped the pencil to unloose the left hand from its\r\nrestraining grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps to prevent interference I had better hold that hand,\" said\r\nEustace to himself, as he watched the pencil. Almost immediately it\r\nbegan to write.\r\n\r\n\"Blundering Borlsovers, unnecessarily unnatural, extraordinarily\r\neccentric, culpably curious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Eustace, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind,\" wrote the hand of Adrian.\r\n\r\n\"Is it my uncle who is writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my prophetic soul, mine uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it anyone I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Silly Eustace, you'll see me very soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall I see you?\"\r\n\r\n\"When poor old Adrian's dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I see you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall you not?\"\r\n\r\nInstead of speaking his next question, Borlsover wrote it. \"What is the\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\nThe fingers dropped the pencil and moved three or four times across the\r\npaper. Then, picking up the pencil, they wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes before four. Put your book away, Eustace. Adrian mustn't\r\nfind us working at this sort of thing. He doesn't know what to make of\r\nit, and I won't have poor old Adrian disturbed. _Au revoir_.\"\r\n\r\nAdrian Borlsover awoke with a start.\r\n\r\n\"I've been dreaming again,\" he said; \"such queer dreams of leaguered\r\ncities and forgotten towns. You were mixed up in this one, Eustace,\r\nthough I can't remember how. Eustace, I want to warn you. Don't walk in\r\ndoubtful paths. Choose your friends well. Your poor grandfather----\"\r\n\r\nA fit of coughing put an end to what he was saying, but Eustace saw that\r\nthe hand was still writing. He managed unnoticed to draw the book away.\r\n\"I'll light the gas,\" he said, \"and ring for tea.\" On the other side of\r\nthe bed curtain he saw the last sentences that had been written.\r\n\r\n\"It's too late, Adrian,\" he read. \"We're friends already; aren't we,\r\nEustace Borlsover?\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day Eustace Borlsover left. He thought his uncle looked\r\nill when he said good-by, and the old man spoke despondently of the\r\nfailure his life had been.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, uncle!\" said his nephew. \"You have got over your difficulties\r\nin a way not one in a hundred thousand would have done. Every one\r\nmarvels at your splendid perseverance in teaching your hand to take the\r\nplace of your lost sight. To me it's been a revelation of the\r\npossibilities of education.\"\r\n\r\n\"Education,\" said his uncle dreamily, as if the word had started a new\r\ntrain of thought, \"education is good so long as you know to whom and for\r\nwhat purpose you give it. But with the lower orders of men, the base and\r\nmore sordid spirits, I have grave doubts as to its results. Well,\r\ngood-by, Eustace, I may not see you again. You are a true Borlsover,\r\nwith all the Borlsover faults. Marry, Eustace. Marry some good, sensible\r\ngirl. And if by any chance I don't see you again, my will is at my\r\nsolicitor's. I've not left you any legacy, because I know you're well\r\nprovided for, but I thought you might like to have my books. Oh, and\r\nthere's just one other thing. You know, before the end people often lose\r\ncontrol over themselves and make absurd requests. Don't pay any\r\nattention to them, Eustace. Good-by!\" and he held out his hand. Eustace\r\ntook it. It remained in his a fraction of a second longer than he had\r\nexpected, and gripped him with a virility that was surprising. There\r\nwas, too, in its touch a subtle sense of intimacy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, uncle!\" he said, \"I shall see you alive and well for many long\r\nyears to come.\"\r\n\r\nTwo months later Adrian Borlsover died.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nEustace Borlsover was in Naples at the time. He read the obituary notice\r\nin the _Morning Post_ on the day announced for the funeral.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old fellow!\" he said. \"I wonder where I shall find room for all\r\nhis books.\"\r\n\r\nThe question occurred to him again with greater force when three days\r\nlater he found himself standing in the library at Borlsover Conyers, a\r\nhuge room built for use, and not for beauty, in the year of Waterloo by\r\na Borlsover who was an ardent admirer of the great Napoleon. It was\r\narranged on the plan of many college libraries, with tall, projecting\r\nbookcases forming deep recesses of dusty silence, fit graves for the old\r\nhates of forgotten controversy, the dead passions of forgotten lives. At\r\nthe end of the room, behind the bust of some unknown eighteenth-century\r\ndivine, an ugly iron corkscrew stair led to a shelf-lined gallery.\r\nNearly every shelf was full.\r\n\r\n\"I must talk to Saunders about it,\" said Eustace. \"I suppose that it\r\nwill be necessary to have the billiard-room fitted up with book cases.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men met for the first time after many weeks in the dining-room\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" said Eustace, standing before the fire with his hands in his\r\npockets. \"How goes the world, Saunders? Why these dress togs?\" He\r\nhimself was wearing an old shooting-jacket. He did not believe in\r\nmourning, as he had told his uncle on his last visit; and though he\r\nusually went in for quiet-colored ties, he wore this evening one of an\r\nugly red, in order to shock Morton the butler, and to make them thrash\r\nout the whole question of mourning for themselves in the servants' hall.\r\nEustace was a true Borlsover. \"The world,\" said Saunders, \"goes the same\r\nas usual, confoundedly slow. The dress togs are accounted for by an\r\ninvitation from Captain Lockwood to bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you getting there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've told your coachman to drive me in your carriage. Any objection?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear me, no! We've had all things in common for far too many years\r\nfor me to raise objections at this hour of the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll find your correspondence in the library,\" went on Saunders.\r\n\"Most of it I've seen to. There are a few private letters I haven't\r\nopened. There's also a box with a rat, or something, inside it that\r\ncame by the evening post. Very likely it's the six-toed albino. I didn't\r\nlook, because I didn't want to mess up my things but I should gather\r\nfrom the way it's jumping about that it's pretty hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll see to it,\" said Eustace, \"while you and the Captain earn an\r\nhonest penny.\"\r\n\r\nDinner over and Saunders gone, Eustace went into the library. Though the\r\nfire had been lit the room was by no means cheerful.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have all the lights on at any rate,\" he said, as he turned the\r\nswitches. \"And, Morton,\" he added, when the butler brought the coffee,\r\n\"get me a screwdriver or something to undo this box. Whatever the animal\r\nis, he's kicking up the deuce of a row. What is it? Why are you\r\ndawdling?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, when the postman brought it he told me that they'd\r\nbored the holes in the lid at the post-office. There were no breathin'\r\nholes in the lid, sir, and they didn't want the animal to die. That is\r\nall, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's culpably careless of the man, whoever he was,\" said Eustace, as he\r\nremoved the screws, \"packing an animal like this in a wooden box with no\r\nmeans of getting air. Confound it all! I meant to ask Morton to bring me\r\na cage to put it in. Now I suppose I shall have to get one myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe placed a heavy book on the lid from which the screws had been\r\nremoved, and went into the billiard-room. As he came back into the\r\nlibrary with an empty cage in his hand he heard the sound of something\r\nfalling, and then of something scuttling along the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Bother it! The beast's got out. How in the world am I to find it again\r\nin this library!\"\r\n\r\nTo search for it did indeed seem hopeless. He tried to follow the sound\r\nof the scuttling in one of the recesses where the animal seemed to be\r\nrunning behind the books in the shelves, but it was impossible to locate\r\nit. Eustace resolved to go on quietly reading. Very likely the animal\r\nmight gain confidence and show itself. Saunders seemed to have dealt in\r\nhis usual methodical manner with most of the correspondence. There were\r\nstill the private letters.\r\n\r\nWhat was that? Two sharp clicks and the lights in the hideous candelabra\r\nthat hung from the ceiling suddenly went out.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if something has gone wrong with the fuse,\" said Eustace, as\r\nhe went to the switches by the door. Then he stopped. There was a noise\r\nat the other end of the room, as if something was crawling up the iron\r\ncorkscrew stair. \"If it's gone into the gallery,\" he said, \"well and\r\ngood.\" He hastily turned on the lights, crossed the room, and climbed up\r\nthe stair. But he could see nothing. His grandfather had placed a little\r\ngate at the top of the stair, so that children could run and romp in the\r\ngallery without fear of accident. This Eustace closed, and having\r\nconsiderably narrowed the circle of his search, returned to his desk by\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nHow gloomy the library was! There was no sense of intimacy about the\r\nroom. The few busts that an eighteenth-century Borlsover had brought\r\nback from the grand tour, might have been in keeping in the old library.\r\nHere they seemed out of place. They made the room feel cold, in spite of\r\nthe heavy red damask curtains and great gilt cornices.\r\n\r\nWith a crash two heavy books fell from the gallery to the floor; then,\r\nas Borlsover looked, another and yet another.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; you'll starve for this, my beauty!\" he said. \"We'll do some\r\nlittle experiments on the metabolism of rats deprived of water. Go on!\r\nChuck them down! I think I've got the upper hand.\" He turned once again\r\nto his correspondence. The letter was from the family solicitor. It\r\nspoke of his uncle's death and of the valuable collection of books that\r\nhad been left to him in the will.\r\n\r\n\"There was one request,\" he read, \"which certainly came as a surprise to\r\nme. As you know, Mr. Adrian Borlsover had left instructions that his\r\nbody was to be buried in as simple a manner as possible at Eastbourne.\r\nHe expressed a desire that there should be neither wreaths nor flowers\r\nof any kind, and hoped that his friends and relatives would not consider\r\nit necessary to wear mourning. The day before his death we received a\r\nletter canceling these instructions. He wished his body to be embalmed\r\n(he gave us the address of the man we were to employ--Pennifer, Ludgate\r\nHill), with orders that his right hand was to be sent to you, stating\r\nthat it was at your special request. The other arrangements as to the\r\nfuneral remained unaltered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" said Eustace; \"what in the world was the old boy driving\r\nat? And what in the name of all that's holy is that?\"\r\n\r\nSomeone was in the gallery. Someone had pulled the cord attached to one\r\nof the blinds, and it had rolled up with a snap. Someone must be in the\r\ngallery, for a second blind did the same. Someone must be walking round\r\nthe gallery, for one after the other the blinds sprang up, letting in\r\nthe moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't got to the bottom of this yet,\" said Eustace, \"but I will do\r\nbefore the night is very much older,\" and he hurried up the corkscrew\r\nstair. He had just got to the top when the lights went out a second\r\ntime, and he heard again the scuttling along the floor. Quickly he stole\r\non tiptoe in the dim moonshine in the direction of the noise, feeling as\r\nhe went for one of the switches. His fingers touched the metal knob at\r\nlast. He turned on the electric light.\r\n\r\nAbout ten yards in front of him, crawling along the floor, was a man's\r\nhand. Eustace stared at it in utter astonishment. It was moving quickly,\r\nin the manner of a geometer caterpillar, the fingers humped up one\r\nmoment, flattened out the next; the thumb appeared to give a crab-like\r\nmotion to the whole. While he was looking, too surprised to stir, the\r\nhand disappeared round the corner. Eustace ran forward. He no longer saw\r\nit, but he could hear it as it squeezed its way behind the books on one\r\nof the shelves. A heavy volume had been displaced. There was a gap in\r\nthe row of books where it had got in. In his fear lest it should escape\r\nhim again, he seized the first book that came to his hand and plugged it\r\ninto the hole. Then, emptying two shelves of their contents, he took the\r\nwooden boards and propped them up in front to make his barrier doubly\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n\"I wish Saunders was back,\" he said; \"one can't tackle this sort of\r\nthing alone.\" It was after eleven, and there seemed little likelihood of\r\nSaunders returning before twelve. He did not dare to leave the shelf\r\nunwatched, even to run downstairs to ring the bell. Morton the butler\r\noften used to come round about eleven to see that the windows were\r\nfastened, but he might not come. Eustace was thoroughly unstrung. At\r\nlast he heard steps down below.\r\n\r\n\"Morton!\" he shouted; \"Morton!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Mr. Saunders got back yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, bring me some brandy, and hurry up about it. I'm up here in the\r\ngallery, you duffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Eustace, as he emptied the glass. \"Don't go to bed yet,\r\nMorton. There are a lot of books that have fallen down by accident;\r\nbring them up and put them back in their shelves.\"\r\n\r\nMorton had never seen Borlsover in so talkative a mood as on that night.\r\n\"Here,\" said Eustace, when the books had been put back and dusted, \"you\r\nmight hold up these boards for me, Morton. That beast in the box got\r\nout, and I've been chasing it all over the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can hear it chawing at the books, sir. They're not valuable,\r\nI hope? I think that's the carriage, sir; I'll go and call Mr.\r\nSaunders.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Eustace that he was away for five minutes, but it could\r\nhardly have been more than one when he returned with Saunders. \"All\r\nright, Morton, you can go now. I'm up here, Saunders.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's all the row?\" asked Saunders, as he lounged forward with his\r\nhands in his pockets. The luck had been with him all the evening. He was\r\ncompletely satisfied, both with himself and with Captain Lockwood's\r\ntaste in wines. \"What's the matter? You look to me to be in an absolute\r\nblue funk.\"\r\n\r\n\"That old devil of an uncle of mine,\" began Eustace--\"oh, I can't\r\nexplain it all. It's his hand that's been playing old Harry all the\r\nevening. But I've got it cornered behind these books. You've got to help\r\nme catch it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's up with you, Eustace? What's the game?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no game, you silly idiot! If you don't believe me take out one of\r\nthose books and put your hand in and feel.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Saunders; \"but wait till I've rolled up my sleeve. The\r\naccumulated dust of centuries, eh?\" He took off his coat, knelt down,\r\nand thrust his arm along the shelf.\r\n\r\n\"There's something there right enough,\" he said. \"It's got a funny\r\nstumpy end to it, whatever it is, and nips like a crab. Ah, no, you\r\ndon't!\" He pulled his hand out in a flash. \"Shove in a book quickly. Now\r\nit can't get out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" asked Eustace.\r\n\r\n\"It was something that wanted very much to get hold of me. I felt what\r\nseemed like a thumb and forefinger. Give me some brandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are we to get it out of there?\"\r\n\r\n\"What about a landing net?\"\r\n\r\n\"No good. It would be too smart for us. I tell you, Saunders, it can\r\ncover the ground far faster than I can walk. But I think I see how we\r\ncan manage it. The two books at the end of the shelf are big ones that\r\ngo right back against the wall. The others are very thin. I'll take out\r\none at a time, and you slide the rest along until we have it squashed\r\nbetween the end two.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly seemed to be the best plan. One by one, as they took out\r\nthe books, the space behind grew smaller and smaller. There was\r\nsomething in it that was certainly very much alive. Once they caught\r\nsight of fingers pressing outward for a way of escape. At last they had\r\nit pressed between the two big books.\r\n\r\n\"There's muscle there, if there isn't flesh and blood,\" said Saunders,\r\nas he held them together. \"It seems to be a hand right enough, too. I\r\nsuppose this is a sort of infectious hallucination. I've read about such\r\ncases before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Infectious fiddlesticks!\" said Eustace, his face white with anger;\r\n\"bring the thing downstairs. We'll get it back into the box.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not altogether easy, but they were successful at last. \"Drive in\r\nthe screws,\" said Eustace, \"we won't run any risks. Put the box in this\r\nold desk of mine. There's nothing in it that I want. Here's the key.\r\nThank goodness, there's nothing wrong with the lock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite a lively evening,\" said Saunders. \"Now let's hear more about your\r\nuncle.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat up together until early morning. Saunders had no desire for\r\nsleep. Eustace was trying to explain and to forget: to conceal from\r\nhimself a fear that he had never felt before--the fear of walking alone\r\ndown the long corridor to his bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it was,\" said Eustace to Saunders on the following morning, \"I\r\npropose that we drop the subject. There's nothing to keep us here for\r\nthe next ten days. We'll motor up to the Lakes and get some climbing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And see nobody all day, and sit bored to death with each other every\r\nnight. Not for me thanks. Why not run up to town? Run's the exact word\r\nin this case, isn't it? We're both in such a blessed funk. Pull yourself\r\ntogether Eustace, and let's have another look at the hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you like,\" said Eustace; \"there's the key.\" They went into the\r\nlibrary and opened the desk. The box was as they had left it on the\r\nprevious night.\r\n\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" asked Eustace.\r\n\r\n\"I am waiting for you to volunteer to open the lid. However, since you\r\nseem to funk it, allow me. There doesn't seem to be the likelihood of\r\nany rumpus this morning, at all events.\" He opened the lid and picked\r\nout the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Cold?\" asked Eustace.\r\n\r\n\"Tepid. A bit below blood-heat by the feel. Soft and supple too. If it's\r\nthe embalming, it's a sort of embalming I've never seen before. Is it\r\nyour uncle's hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, it's his all right,\" said Eustace. \"I should know those long\r\nthin fingers anywhere. Put it back in the box, Saunders. Never mind\r\nabout the screws. I'll lock the desk, so that there'll be no chance of\r\nits getting out. We'll compromise by motoring up to town for a week. If\r\nwe get off soon after lunch we ought to be at Grantham or Stamford by\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said Saunders; \"and to-morrow--Oh, well, by to-morrow we shall\r\nhave forgotten all about this beastly thing.\"\r\n\r\nIf when the morrow came they had not forgotten, it was certainly true\r\nthat at the end of the week they were able to tell a very vivid ghost\r\nstory at the little supper Eustace gave on Hallow E'en.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want us to believe that it's true, Mr. Borlsover? How\r\nperfectly awful!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take my oath on it, and so would Saunders here; wouldn't you, old\r\nchap?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any number of oaths,\" said Saunders. \"It was a long thin hand, you\r\nknow, and it gripped me just like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't Mr. Saunders! Don't! How perfectly horrid! Now tell us another\r\none, do. Only a really creepy one, please!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Here's a pretty mess!\" said Eustace on the following day as he threw a\r\nletter across the table to Saunders. \"It's your affair, though. Mrs.\r\nMerrit, if I understand it, gives a month's notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's quite absurd on Mrs. Merrit's part,\" Saunders replied. \"She\r\ndoesn't know what she's talking about. Let's see what she says.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,\" he read, \"this is to let you know that I must give you a\r\nmonth's notice as from Tuesday the 13th. For a long time I've felt the\r\nplace too big for me, but when Jane Parfit, and Emma Laidlaw go off\r\nwith scarcely as much as an 'if you please,' after frightening the wits\r\nout of the other girls, so that they can't turn out a room by themselves\r\nor walk alone down the stairs for fear of treading on half-frozen toads\r\nor hearing it run along the passages at night, all I can say is that\r\nit's no place for me. So I must ask you, Mr. Borlsover, sir, to find a\r\nnew housekeeper that has no objection to large and lonely houses, which\r\nsome people do say, not that I believe them for a minute, my poor mother\r\nalways having been a Wesleyan, are haunted.\r\n\r\n                                \"Yours faithfully,\r\n                                     ELIZABETH MERRIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--I should be obliged if you would give my respects to Mr.\r\nSaunders. I hope that he won't run no risks with his cold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Saunders,\" said Eustace, \"you've always had a wonderful way with you in\r\ndealing with servants. You mustn't let poor old Merrit go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course she shan't go,\" said Saunders. \"She's probably only angling\r\nfor a rise in salary. I'll write to her this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; there's nothing like a personal interview. We've had enough of\r\ntown. We'll go back to-morrow, and you must work your cold for all it's\r\nworth. Don't forget that it's got on to the chest, and will require\r\nweeks of feeding up and nursing.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I think I can manage Mrs. Merrit.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Merrit was more obstinate than he had thought. She was very\r\nsorry to hear of Mr. Saunders's cold, and how he lay awake all night in\r\nLondon coughing; very sorry indeed. She'd change his room for him\r\ngladly, and get the south room aired. And wouldn't he have a basin of\r\nhot bread and milk last thing at night? But she was afraid that she\r\nwould have to leave at the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\"Try her with an increase of salary,\" was the advice of Eustace.\r\n\r\nIt was no use. Mrs. Merrit was obdurate, though she knew of a Mrs.\r\nHandyside who had been housekeeper to Lord Gargrave, who might be glad\r\nto come at the salary mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with the servants, Morton?\" asked Eustace that\r\nevening when he brought the coffee into the library. \"What's all this\r\nabout Mrs. Merrit wanting to leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, I was going to mention it myself. I have a\r\nconfession to make, sir. When I found your note asking me to open that\r\ndesk and take out the box with the rat, I broke the lock as you told me,\r\nand was glad to do it, because I could hear the animal in the box making\r\na great noise, and I thought it wanted food. So I took out the box, sir,\r\nand got a cage, and was going to transfer it, when the animal got away.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the world are you talking about? I never wrote any such note.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sir, it was the note I picked up here on the floor on the\r\nday you and Mr. Saunders left. I have it in my pocket now.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly seemed to be in Eustace's handwriting. It was written in\r\npencil, and began somewhat abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Get a hammer, Morton,\" he read, \"or some other tool, and break open the\r\nlock in the old desk in the library. Take out the box that is inside.\r\nYou need not do anything else. The lid is already open. Eustace\r\nBorlsover.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you opened the desk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; and as I was getting the cage ready the animal hopped out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What animal?\"\r\n\r\n\"The animal inside the box, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did it look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I couldn't tell you,\" said Morton nervously; \"my back was\r\nturned, and it was halfway down the room when I looked up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was its color?\" asked Saunders; \"black?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir, a grayish white. It crept along in a very funny way, sir.\r\nI don't think it had a tail.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tried to catch it, but it was no use. So I set the rat-traps and kept\r\nthe library shut. Then that girl Emma Laidlaw left the door open when\r\nshe was cleaning, and I think it must have escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think it was the animal that's been frightening the maids?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, sir, not quite. They said it was--you'll excuse me, sir--a\r\nhand that they saw. Emma trod on it once at the bottom of the stairs.\r\nShe thought then it was a half-frozen toad, only white. And then Parfit\r\nwas washing up the dishes in the scullery. She wasn't thinking about\r\nanything in particular. It was close on dusk. She took her hands out of\r\nthe water and was drying them absent-minded like on the roller towel,\r\nwhen she found that she was drying someone else's hand as well, only\r\ncolder than hers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense!\" exclaimed Saunders.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, sir; that's what I told her; but we couldn't get her to stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't believe all this?\" said Eustace, turning suddenly towards the\r\nbutler.\r\n\r\n\"Me, sir? Oh, no, sir! I've not seen anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor heard anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, if you must know, the bells do ring at odd times, and\r\nthere's nobody there when we go; and when we go round to draw the blinds\r\nof a night, as often as not somebody's been there before us. But as I\r\nsays to Mrs. Merrit, a young monkey might do wonderful things, and we\r\nall know that Mr. Borlsover has had some strange animals about the\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Morton, that will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it?\" asked Saunders when they were alone. \"I mean\r\nof the letter he said you wrote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's simple enough,\" said Eustace. \"See the paper it's written\r\non? I stopped using that years ago, but there were a few odd sheets and\r\nenvelopes left in the old desk. We never fastened up the lid of the box\r\nbefore locking it in. The hand got out, found a pencil, wrote this note,\r\nand shoved it through a crack on to the floor where Morton found it.\r\nThat's plain as daylight.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the hand couldn't write?\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't it? You've not seen it do the things I've seen,\" and he told\r\nSaunders more of what had happened at Eastbourne.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Saunders, \"in that case we have at least an explanation of\r\nthe legacy. It was the hand which wrote unknown to your uncle that\r\nletter to your solicitor, bequeathing itself to you. Your uncle had no\r\nmore to do with that request than I. In fact, it would seem that he had\r\nsome idea of this automatic writing, and feared it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if it's not my uncle, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose some people might say that a disembodied spirit had got your\r\nuncle to educate and prepare a little body for it. Now it's got into\r\nthat little body and is off on its own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll keep our eyes open,\" said Saunders, \"and try to catch it. If we\r\ncan't do that, we shall have to wait till the bally clockwork runs\r\ndown. After all, if it's flesh and blood, it can't live for ever.\"\r\n\r\nFor two days nothing happened. Then Saunders saw it sliding down the\r\nbanister in the hall. He was taken unawares, and lost a full second\r\nbefore he started in pursuit, only to find that the thing had escaped\r\nhim. Three days later, Eustace, writing alone in the library at night,\r\nsaw it sitting on an open book at the other end of the room. The fingers\r\ncrept over the page, feeling the print as if it were reading; but before\r\nhe had time to get up from his seat, it had taken the alarm and was\r\npulling itself up the curtains. Eustace watched it grimly as it hung on\r\nto the cornice with three fingers, flicking thumb and forefinger at him\r\nin an expression of scornful derision.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I'll do,\" he said. \"If I only get it into the open I'll set\r\nthe dogs on to it.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke to Saunders of the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"It's jolly good idea,\" he said; \"only we won't wait till we find it out\r\nof doors. We'll get the dogs. There are the two terriers and the\r\nunder-keeper's Irish mongrel that's on to rats like a flash. Your\r\nspaniel has not got spirit enough for this sort of game.\" They brought\r\nthe dogs into the house, and the keeper's Irish mongrel chewed up the\r\nslippers, and the terriers tripped up Morton as he waited at table; but\r\nall three were welcome. Even false security is better than no security\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight nothing happened. Then the hand was caught, not by the\r\ndogs, but by Mrs. Merrit's gray parrot. The bird was in the habit of\r\nperiodically removing the pins that kept its seed and water tins in\r\nplace, and of escaping through the holes in the side of the cage. When\r\nonce at liberty Peter would show no inclination to return, and would\r\noften be about the house for days. Now, after six consecutive weeks of\r\ncaptivity, Peter had again discovered a new means of unloosing his bolts\r\nand was at large, exploring the tapestried forests of the curtains and\r\nsinging songs in praise of liberty from cornice and picture rail.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use your trying to catch him,\" said Eustace to Mrs. Merrit, as\r\nshe came into the study one afternoon towards dusk with a step-ladder.\r\n\"You'd much better leave Peter alone. Starve him into surrender, Mrs.\r\nMerrit, and don't leave bananas and seed about for him to peck at when\r\nhe fancies he's hungry. You're far too softhearted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I see he's right out of reach now on that picture rail, so\r\nif you wouldn't mind closing the door, sir, when you leave the room,\r\nI'll bring his cage in to-night and put some meat inside it. He's that\r\nfond of meat, though it does make him pull out his feathers to suck the\r\nquills. They _do_ say that if you cook--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Mrs. Merrit,\" said Eustace, who was busy writing. \"That\r\nwill do; I'll keep an eye on the bird.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the room, unbroken but for the continuous whisper\r\nof his pen.\r\n\r\n\"Scratch poor Peter,\" said the bird. \"Scratch poor old Peter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, you beastly bird!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Peter! Scratch poor Peter, do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm more likely to wring your neck if I get hold of you.\" He looked up\r\nat the picture rail, and there was the hand holding on to a hook with\r\nthree fingers, and slowly scratching the head of the parrot with the\r\nfourth. Eustace ran to the bell and pressed it hard; then across to the\r\nwindow, which he closed with a bang. Frightened by the noise the parrot\r\nshook its wings preparatory to flight, and as it did so the fingers of\r\nthe hand got hold of it by the throat. There was a shrill scream from\r\nPeter as he fluttered across the room, wheeling round in circles that\r\never descended, borne down under the weight that clung to him. The bird\r\ndropped at last quite suddenly, and Eustace saw fingers and feathers\r\nrolled into an inextricable mass on the floor. The struggle abruptly\r\nceased as finger and thumb squeezed the neck; the bird's eyes rolled up\r\nto show the whites, and there was a faint, half-choked gurgle. But\r\nbefore the fingers had time to loose their hold, Eustace had them in his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\"Send Mr. Saunders here at once,\" he said to the maid who came in answer\r\nto the bell. \"Tell him I want him immediately.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went with the hand to the fire. There was a ragged gash across\r\nthe back where the bird's beak had torn it, but no blood oozed from the\r\nwound. He noticed with disgust that the nails had grown long and\r\ndiscolored.\r\n\r\n\"I'll burn the beastly thing,\" he said. But he could not burn it. He\r\ntried to throw it into the flames, but his own hands, as if restrained\r\nby some old primitive feeling, would not let him. And so Saunders found\r\nhim pale and irresolute, with the hand still clasped tightly in his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it at last,\" he said in a tone of triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Good; let's have a look at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not when it's loose. Get me some nails and a hammer and a board of some\r\nsort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you hold it all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the thing's quite limp; tired out with throttling poor old Peter,\r\nI should say.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Saunders when he returned with the things, \"what are we\r\ngoing to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drive a nail through it first, so that it can't get away; then we can\r\ntake our time over examining it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it yourself,\" said Saunders. \"I don't mind helping you with\r\nguinea-pigs occasionally when there's something to be learned; partly\r\nbecause I don't fear a guinea-pig's revenge. This thing's different.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, you miserable skunk. I won't forget the way you've stood by\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHe took up a nail, and before Saunders had realised what he was doing\r\nhad driven it through the hand, deep into the board.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my aunt,\" he giggled hysterically, \"look at it now,\" for the hand\r\nwas writhing in agonized contortions, squirming and wriggling upon the\r\nnail like a worm upon the hook.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Saunders, \"you've done it now. I'll leave you to examine\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, in heaven's name. Cover it up, man, cover it up! Shove a\r\ncloth over it! Here!\" and he pulled off the antimacassar from the back\r\nof a chair and wrapped the board in it. \"Now get the keys from my pocket\r\nand open the safe. Chuck the other things out. Oh, Lord, it's getting\r\nitself into frightful knots! and open it quick!\" He threw the thing in\r\nand banged the door.\r\n\r\n\"We'll keep it there till it dies,\" he said. \"May I burn in hell if I\r\never open the door of that safe again.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrit departed at the end of the month. Her successor certainly\r\nwas more successful in the management of the servants. Early in her rule\r\nshe declared that she would stand no nonsense, and gossip soon withered\r\nand died. Eustace Borlsover went back to his old way of life. Old habits\r\ncrept over and covered his new experience. He was, if anything, less\r\nmorose, and showed a greater inclination to take his natural part in\r\ncountry society.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't be surprised if he marries one of these days,\" said\r\nSaunders. \"Well, I'm in no hurry for such an event. I know Eustace far\r\ntoo well for the future Mrs. Borlsover to like me. It will be the same\r\nold story again: a long friendship slowly made--marriage--and a long\r\nfriendship quickly forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBut Eustace Borlsover did not follow the advice of his uncle and marry.\r\nHe was too fond of old slippers and tobacco. The cooking, too, under\r\nMrs. Handyside's management was excellent, and she seemed, too, to have\r\na heaven-sent faculty in knowing when to stop dusting.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the old life resumed its old power. Then came the\r\nburglary. The men, it was said, broke into the house by way of the\r\nconservatory. It was really little more than an attempt, for they only\r\nsucceeded in carrying away a few pieces of plate from the pantry. The\r\nsafe in the study was certainly found open and empty, but, as Mr.\r\nBorlsover informed the police inspector, he had kept nothing of value in\r\nit during the last six months.\r\n\r\n\"Then you're lucky in getting off so easily, sir,\" the man replied. \"By\r\nthe way they have gone about their business, I should say they were\r\nexperienced cracksmen. They must have caught the alarm when they were\r\njust beginning their evening's work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Eustace, \"I suppose I am lucky.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no doubt,\" said the inspector, \"that we shall be able to trace\r\nthe men. I've said that they must have been old hands at the game. The\r\nway they got in and opened the safe shows that. But there's one little\r\nthing that puzzles me. One of them was careless enough not to wear\r\ngloves, and I'm bothered if I know what he was trying to do. I've traced\r\nhis finger-marks on the new varnish on the window sashes in every one of\r\nthe downstairs rooms. They are very distinct ones too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right hand or left, or both?\" asked Eustace.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, right every time. That's the funny thing. He must have been a\r\nfoolhardy fellow, and I rather think it was him that wrote that.\" He\r\ntook out a slip of paper from his pocket. \"That's what he wrote, sir.\r\n'I've got out, Eustace Borlsover, but I'll be back before long.' Some\r\ngaol bird just escaped, I suppose. It will make it all the easier for us\r\nto trace him. Do you know the writing, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Eustace; \"it's not the writing of anyone I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to stay here any longer,\" said Eustace to Saunders at\r\nluncheon. \"I've got on far better during the last six months than ever I\r\nexpected, but I'm not going to run the risk of seeing that thing again.\r\nI shall go up to town this afternoon. Get Morton to put my things\r\ntogether, and join me with the car at Brighton on the day after\r\nto-morrow. And bring the proofs of those two papers with you. We'll run\r\nover them together.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long are you going to be away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say for certain, but be prepared to stay for some time. We've\r\nstuck to work pretty closely through the summer, and I for one need a\r\nholiday. I'll engage the rooms at Brighton. You'll find it best to break\r\nthe journey at Hitchin. I'll wire to you there at the Crown to tell you\r\nthe Brighton address.\"\r\n\r\nThe house he chose at Brighton was in a terrace. He had been there\r\nbefore. It was kept by his old college gyp, a man of discreet silence,\r\nwho was admirably partnered by an excellent cook. The rooms were on the\r\nfirst floor. The two bedrooms were at the back, and opened out of each\r\nother. \"Saunders can have the smaller one, though it is the only one\r\nwith a fireplace,\" he said. \"I'll stick to the larger of the two, since\r\nit's got a bathroom adjoining. I wonder what time he'll arrive with the\r\ncar.\"\r\n\r\nSaunders came about seven, cold and cross and dirty. \"We'll light the\r\nfire in the dining-room,\" said Eustace, \"and get Prince to unpack some\r\nof the things while we are at dinner. What were the roads like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rotten; swimming with mud, and a beastly cold wind against us all day.\r\nAnd this is July. Dear old England!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Eustace, \"I think we might do worse than leave dear old\r\nEngland for a few months.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned in soon after twelve.\r\n\r\n\"You oughtn't to feel cold, Saunders,\" said Eustace, \"when you can\r\nafford to sport a great cat-skin lined coat like this. You do yourself\r\nvery well, all things considered. Look at those gloves, for instance.\r\nWho could possibly feel cold when wearing them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are far too clumsy though for driving. Try them on and see,\" and\r\nhe tossed them through the door on to Eustace's bed, and went on with\r\nhis unpacking. A minute later he heard a shrill cry of terror. \"Oh,\r\nLord,\" he heard, \"it's in the glove! Quick, Saunders, quick!\" Then came\r\na smacking thud. Eustace had thrown it from him. \"I've chucked it into\r\nthe bathroom,\" he gasped, \"it's hit the wall and fallen into the bath.\r\nCome now if you want to help.\" Saunders, with a lighted candle in his\r\nhand, looked over the edge of the bath. There it was, old and maimed,\r\ndumb and blind, with a ragged hole in the middle, crawling, staggering,\r\ntrying to creep up the slippery sides, only to fall back helpless.\r\n\r\n\"Stay there,\" said Saunders. \"I'll empty a collar box or something, and\r\nwe'll jam it in. It can't get out while I'm away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it can,\" shouted Eustace. \"It's getting out now. It's climbing up\r\nthe plug chain. No, you brute, you filthy brute, you don't! Come back,\r\nSaunders, it's getting away from me. I can't hold it; it's all slippery.\r\nCurse its claw! Shut the window, you idiot! The top too, as well as the\r\nbottom. You utter idiot! It's got out!\" There was the sound of\r\nsomething dropping on to the hard flagstones below, and Eustace fell\r\nback fainting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight he was ill.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to make of it,\" the doctor said to Saunders. \"I can\r\nonly suppose that Mr. Borlsover has suffered some great emotional shock.\r\nYou had better let me send someone to help you nurse him. And by all\r\nmeans indulge that whim of his never to be left alone in the dark. I\r\nwould keep a light burning all night if I were you. But he _must_ have\r\nmore fresh air. It's perfectly absurd this hatred of open windows.\"\r\n\r\nEustace, however, would have no one with him but Saunders. \"I don't want\r\nthe other men,\" he said. \"They'd smuggle it in somehow. I know they\r\nwould.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about it, old chap. This sort of thing can't go on\r\nindefinitely. You know I saw it this time as well as you. It wasn't half\r\nso active. It won't go on living much longer, especially after that\r\nfall. I heard it hit the flags myself. As soon as you're a bit stronger\r\nwe'll leave this place; not bag and baggage, but with only the clothes\r\non our backs, so that it won't be able to hide anywhere. We'll escape it\r\nthat way. We won't give any address, and we won't have any parcels sent\r\nafter us. Cheer up, Eustace! You'll be well enough to leave in a day or\r\ntwo. The doctor says I can take you out in a chair to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I done?\" asked Eustace. \"Why does it come after me? I'm no\r\nworse than other men. I'm no worse than you, Saunders; you know I'm not.\r\nIt was you who were at the bottom of that dirty business in San Diego,\r\nand that was fifteen years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not that, of course,\" said Saunders. \"We are in the twentieth\r\ncentury, and even the parsons have dropped the idea of your old sins\r\nfinding you out. Before you caught the hand in the library it was filled\r\nwith pure malevolence--to you and all mankind. After you spiked it\r\nthrough with that nail it naturally forgot about other people, and\r\nconcentrated its attention on you. It was shut up in the safe, you know,\r\nfor nearly six months. That gives plenty of time for thinking of\r\nrevenge.\"\r\n\r\nEustace Borlsover would not leave his room, but he thought that there\r\nmight be something in Saunders's suggestion to leave Brighton without\r\nnotice. He began rapidly to regain his strength.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go on the first of September,\" he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe evening of August 31st was oppressively warm. Though at midday the\r\nwindows had been wide open, they had been shut an hour or so before\r\ndusk. Mrs. Prince had long since ceased to wonder at the strange habits\r\nof the gentlemen on the first floor. Soon after their arrival she had\r\nbeen told to take down the heavy window curtains in the two bedrooms,\r\nand day by day the rooms had seemed to grow more bare. Nothing was left\r\nlying about.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Borlsover doesn't like to have any place where dirt can collect,\"\r\nSaunders had said as an excuse. \"He likes to see into all the corners of\r\nthe room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I open the window just a little?\" he said to Eustace that\r\nevening. \"We're simply roasting in here, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, leave well alone. We're not a couple of boarding-school misses\r\nfresh from a course of hygiene lectures. Get the chessboard out.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down and played. At ten o'clock Mrs. Prince came to the door\r\nwith a note. \"I am sorry I didn't bring it before,\" she said, \"but it\r\nwas left in the letter-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open it, Saunders, and see if it wants answering.\"\r\n\r\nIt was very brief. There was neither address nor signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Will eleven o'clock to-night be suitable for our last appointment?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who is it from?\" asked Borlsover.\r\n\r\n\"It was meant for me,\" said Saunders. \"There's no answer, Mrs. Prince,\"\r\nand he put the paper into his pocket. \"A dunning letter from a tailor; I\r\nsuppose he must have got wind of our leaving.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a clever lie, and Eustace asked no more questions. They went on\r\nwith their game.\r\n\r\nOn the landing outside Saunders could hear the grandfather's clock\r\nwhispering the seconds, blurting out the quarter-hours.\r\n\r\n\"Check!\" said Eustace. The clock struck eleven. At the same time there\r\nwas a gentle knocking on the door; it seemed to come from the bottom\r\npanel.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" asked Eustace.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Prince, is that you?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is up above,\" said Saunders; \"I can hear her walking about the\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then lock the door; bolt it too. Your move, Saunders.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Saunders sat with his eyes on the chessboard, Eustace walked over\r\nto the window and examined the fastenings. He did the same in Saunders's\r\nroom and the bathroom. There were no doors between the three rooms, or\r\nhe would have shut and locked them too.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Saunders,\" he said, \"don't stay all night over your move. I've had\r\ntime to smoke one cigarette already. It's bad to keep an invalid\r\nwaiting. There's only one possible thing for you to do. What was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ivy blowing against the window. There, it's your move now,\r\nEustace.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't the ivy, you idiot. It was someone tapping at the window,\"\r\nand he pulled up the blind. On the outer side of the window, clinging to\r\nthe sash, was the hand.\r\n\r\n\"What is it that it's holding?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a pocket-knife. It's going to try to open the window by pushing\r\nback the fastener with the blade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let it try,\" said Eustace. \"Those fasteners screw down; they\r\ncan't be opened that way. Anyhow, we'll close the shutters. It's your\r\nmove, Saunders. I've played.\"\r\n\r\nBut Saunders found it impossible to fix his attention on the game. He\r\ncould not understand Eustace, who seemed all at once to have lost his\r\nfear. \"What do you say to some wine?\" he asked. \"You seem to be taking\r\nthings coolly, but I don't mind confessing that I'm in a blessed funk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've no need to be. There's nothing supernatural about that hand,\r\nSaunders. I mean it seems to be governed by the laws of time and space.\r\nIt's not the sort of thing that vanishes into thin air or slides through\r\noaken doors. And since that's so, I defy it to get in here. We'll leave\r\nthe place in the morning. I for one have bottomed the depths of fear.\r\nFill your glass, man! The windows are all shuttered, the door is locked\r\nand bolted. Pledge me my uncle Adrian! Drink, man! What are you waiting\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\nSaunders was standing with his glass half raised. \"It can get in,\" he\r\nsaid hoarsely; \"it can get in! We've forgotten. There's the fireplace in\r\nmy bedroom. It will come down the chimney.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" said Eustace, as he rushed into the other room; \"we haven't a\r\nminute to lose. What can we do? Light the fire, Saunders. Give me a\r\nmatch, quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"They must be all in the other room. I'll get them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry, man, for goodness' sake! Look in the bookcase! Look in the\r\nbathroom! Here, come and stand here; I'll look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quick!\" shouted Saunders. \"I can hear something!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then plug a sheet from your bed up the chimney. No, here's a match.\" He\r\nhad found one at last that had slipped into a crack in the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Is the fire laid? Good, but it may not burn. I know--the oil from that\r\nold reading-lamp and this cotton-wool. Now the match, quick! Pull the\r\nsheet away, you fool! We don't want it now.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great roar from the grate as the flames shot up. Saunders\r\nhad been a fraction of a second too late with the sheet. The oil had\r\nfallen on to it. It, too, was burning.\r\n\r\n\"The whole place will be on fire!\" cried Eustace, as he tried to beat\r\nout the flames with a blanket. \"It's no good! I can't manage it. You\r\nmust open the door, Saunders, and get help.\"\r\n\r\nSaunders ran to the door and fumbled with the bolts. The key was stiff\r\nin the lock.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry!\" shouted Eustace; \"the whole place is ablaze!\"\r\n\r\nThe key turned in the lock at last. For half a second Saunders stopped\r\nto look back. Afterwards he could never be quite sure as to what he had\r\nseen, but at the time he thought that something black and charred was\r\ncreeping slowly, very slowly, from the mass of flames towards Eustace\r\nBorlsover. For a moment he thought of returning to his friend, but the\r\nnoise and the smell of the burning sent him running down the passage\r\ncrying, \"Fire! Fire!\" He rushed to the telephone to summon help, and\r\nthen back to the bathroom--he should have thought of that before--for\r\nwater. As he burst open the bedroom door there came a scream of terror\r\nwhich ended suddenly, and then the sound of a heavy fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mass of Shadows\r\n\r\nBY ANATOLE FRANCE\r\n\r\n     From _Mother of Pearl_, by Anatole France.

By permission of the publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tale the sacristan of the church of St. Eulalie at Neuville\r\nd'Aumont told me, as we sat under the arbor of the White Horse, one fine\r\nsummer evening, drinking a bottle of old wine to the health of the dead\r\nman, now very much at his ease, whom that very morning he had borne to\r\nthe grave with full honors, beneath a pall powdered with smart silver\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"My poor father who is dead\" (it is the sacristan who is speaking,) \"was\r\nin his lifetime a grave-digger. He was of an agreeable disposition, the\r\nresult, no doubt, of the calling he followed, for it has often been\r\npointed out that people who work in cemeteries are of a jovial turn.\r\nDeath has no terrors for them; they never give it a thought. I, for\r\ninstance, monsieur, enter a cemetery at night as little perturbed as\r\nthough it were the arbor of the White Horse. And if by chance I meet\r\nwith a ghost, I don't disturb myself in the least about it, for I\r\nreflect that he may just as likely have business of his own to attend to\r\nas I. I know the habits of the dead, and I know their character.\r\nIndeed, so far as that goes, I know things of which the priests\r\nthemselves are ignorant. If I were to tell you all I have seen, you\r\nwould be astounded. But a still tongue makes a wise head, and my father,\r\nwho, all the same, delighted in spinning a yarn, did not disclose a\r\ntwentieth part of what he knew. To make up for this he often repeated\r\nthe same stories, and to my knowledge he told the story of Catherine\r\nFontaine at least a hundred times.\r\n\r\n\"Catherine Fontaine was an old maid whom he well remembered having seen\r\nwhen he was a mere child. I should not be surprised if there were still,\r\nperhaps, three old fellows in the district who could remember having\r\nheard folks speak of her, for she was very well known and of excellent\r\nreputation, though poor enough. She lived at the corner of the Rue aux\r\nNonnes, in the turret which is still to be seen there, and which formed\r\npart of an old half-ruined mansion looking on to the garden of the\r\nUrsuline nuns. On that turret can still be traced certain figures and\r\nhalf-obliterated inscriptions. The late curé of St. Eulalie, Monsieur\r\nLevasseur, asserted that there are the words in Latin, _Love is stronger\r\nthan death_, 'which is to be understood,' so he would add, 'of divine\r\nlove.'\r\n\r\n\"Catherine Fontaine lived by herself in this tiny apartment. She was a\r\nlace-maker. You know, of course, that the lace made in our part of the\r\nworld was formerly held in high esteem. No one knew anything of her\r\nrelatives or friends. It was reported that when she was eighteen years\r\nof age she had loved the young Chevalier d'Aumont-Cléry, and had been\r\nsecretly affianced to him. But decent folk didn't believe a word of it,\r\nand said it was nothing but a tale concocted because Catherine\r\nFontaine's demeanor was that of a lady rather than that of a working\r\nwoman, and because, moreover, she possessed beneath her white locks the\r\nremains of great beauty. Her expression was sorrowful, and on one finger\r\nshe wore one of those rings fashioned by the goldsmith into the\r\nsemblance of two tiny hands clasped together. In former days folks were\r\naccustomed to exchange such rings at their betrothal ceremony. I am sure\r\nyou know the sort of thing I mean.\r\n\r\n\"Catherine Fontaine lived a saintly life. She spent a great deal of time\r\nin churches, and every morning, whatever might be the weather, she went\r\nto assist at the six o'clock Mass at St. Eulalie.\r\n\r\n\"Now one December night, whilst she was in her little chamber, she was\r\nawakened by the sound of bells, and nothing doubting that they were\r\nringing for the first Mass, the pious woman dressed herself, and came\r\ndownstairs and out into the street. The night was so obscure that not\r\neven the walls of the houses were visible, and not a ray of light shone\r\nfrom the murky sky. And such was the silence amid this black darkness,\r\nthat there was not even the sound of a distant dog barking, and a\r\nfeeling of aloofness from every living creature was perceptible. But\r\nCatherine Fontaine knew well every single stone she stepped on, and, as\r\nshe could have found her way to the church with her eyes shut, she\r\nreached without difficulty the corner of the Rue aux Nonnes and the Rue\r\nde la Paroisse, where the timbered house stands with the tree of Jesse\r\ncarved on one of its massive beams. When she reached this spot she\r\nperceived that the church doors were open, and that a great light was\r\nstreaming out from the wax tapers. She resumed her journey, and when she\r\nhad passed through the porch she found herself in the midst of a vast\r\ncongregation which entirely filled the church. But she did not recognize\r\nany of the worshipers and was surprised to observe that all of these\r\npeople were dressed in velvets and brocades, with feathers in their\r\nhats, and that they wore swords in the fashion of days gone by. Here\r\nwere gentlemen who carried tall canes with gold knobs, and ladies with\r\nlace caps fastened with coronet-shaped combs. Chevaliers of the Order of\r\nSt. Louis extended their hands to these ladies, who concealed behind\r\ntheir fans painted faces, of which only the powdered brow and the patch\r\nat the corner of the eye were visible! All of them proceeded to take\r\ntheir places without the slightest sound, and as they moved neither the\r\nsound of their footsteps on the pavement, nor the rustle of their\r\ngarments could be heard. The lower places were filled with a crowd of\r\nyoung artisans in brown jackets, dimity breeches, and blue stockings,\r\nwith their arms round the waists of pretty blushing girls who lowered\r\ntheir eyes. Near the holy water stoups peasant women, in scarlet\r\npetticoats and laced bodices, sat upon the ground as immovable as\r\ndomestic animals, whilst young lads, standing up behind them, stared out\r\nfrom wide-open eyes and twirled their hats round and round on their\r\nfingers, and all these sorrowful countenances seemed centred irremovably\r\non one and the same thought, at once sweet and sorrowful. On her knees,\r\nin her accustomed place, Catherine Fontaine saw the priest advance\r\ntoward the altar, preceded by two servers. She recognized neither priest\r\nnor clerks. The Mass began. It was a silent Mass, during which neither\r\nthe sound of the moving lips nor the tinkle of the bell was audible.\r\nCatherine Fontaine felt that she was under the observation and the\r\ninfluence also of her mysterious neighbor, and when, scarcely turning\r\nher head, she stole a glance at him, she recognized the young Chevalier\r\nd'Aumont-Cléry, who had once loved her, and who had been dead for five\r\nand forty years. She recognized him by a small mark which he had over\r\nthe left ear, and above all by the shadow which his long black eyelashes\r\ncast upon his cheeks. He was dressed in his hunting clothes, scarlet\r\nwith gold lace, the very clothes he wore that day when he met her in St.\r\nLeonard's Wood, begged of her a drink, and stole a kiss. He had\r\npreserved his youth and good looks. When he smiled, he still displayed\r\nmagnificent teeth. Catherine said to him in an undertone:\r\n\r\n\"'Monseigneur, you who were my friend, and to whom in days gone by I\r\ngave all that a girl holds most dear, may God keep you in His grace! O,\r\nthat He would at length inspire me with regret for the sin I committed\r\nin yielding to you; for it is a fact that, though my hair is white and I\r\napproach my end, I have not yet repented of having loved you. But, dear\r\ndead friend and noble seigneur, tell me, who are these folk, habited\r\nafter the antique fashion, who are here assisting at this silent Mass?'\r\n\r\n\"The Chevalier d'Aumont-Cléry replied in a voice feebler than a breath,\r\nbut none the less crystal clear:\r\n\r\n\"'Catherine, these men and women are souls from purgatory who have\r\ngrieved God by sinning as we ourselves sinned through love of the\r\ncreature, but who are not on that account cast off by God, inasmuch as\r\ntheir sin, like ours, was not deliberate.\r\n\r\n\"'Whilst separated from those whom they loved upon earth, they are\r\npurified in the cleansing fires of purgatory, they suffer the pangs of\r\nabsence, which is for them the most cruel of tortures. They are so\r\nunhappy that an angel from heaven takes pity upon their love-torment. By\r\nthe permission of the Most High, for one hour in the night, he reunites\r\neach year lover to loved in their parish church, where they are\r\npermitted to assist at the Mass of Shadows, hand clasped in hand. These\r\nare the facts. If it has been granted to me to see thee before thy\r\ndeath, Catherine, it is a boon which is bestowed by God's special\r\npermission.'\r\n\r\n\"And Catherine Fontaine answered him:\r\n\r\n\"'I would die gladly enough, dear, dead lord, if I might recover the\r\nbeauty that was mine when I gave you to drink in the forest.'\r\n\r\n\"Whilst they thus conversed under their breath, a very old canon was\r\ntaking the collection and proffering to the worshipers a great copper\r\ndish, wherein they let fall, each in his turn, ancient coins which have\r\nlong since ceased to pass current: écus of six livres, florins, ducats\r\nand ducatoons, jacobuses and rose-nobles, and the pieces fell silently\r\ninto the dish. When at length it was placed before the Chevalier, he\r\ndropped into it a louis which made no more sound than had the other\r\npieces of gold and silver.\r\n\r\n\"Then the old canon stopped before Catherine Fontaine, who fumbled in\r\nher pocket without being able to find a farthing. Then, being unwilling\r\nto allow the dish to pass without an offering from herself, she slipped\r\nfrom her finger the ring which the Chevalier had given her the day\r\nbefore his death, and cast it into the copper bowl. As the golden ring\r\nfell, a sound like the heavy clang of a bell rang out, and on the stroke\r\nof this reverberation the Chevalier, the canon, the celebrant, the\r\nservers, the ladies and their cavaliers, the whole assembly vanished\r\nutterly; the candles guttered out, and Catherine Fontaine was left alone\r\nin the darkness.\"\r\n\r\nHaving concluded his narrative after this fashion, the sacristan drank a\r\nlong draught of wine, remained pensive for a moment, and then resumed\r\nhis talk in these words:\r\n\r\n\"I have told you this tale exactly as my father has told it to me over\r\nand over again, and I believe that it is authentic, because it agrees in\r\nall respects with what I have observed of the manners and customs\r\npeculiar to those who have passed away. I have associated a good deal\r\nwith the dead ever since my childhood, and I know that they are\r\naccustomed to return to what they have loved.\r\n\r\n\"It is on this account that the miserly dead wander at night in the\r\nneighborhood of the treasures they conceal during their life time. They\r\nkeep a strict watch over their gold; but the trouble they give\r\nthemselves, far from being of service to them, turns to their\r\ndisadvantage; and it is not a rare thing at all to come upon money\r\nburied in the ground on digging in a place haunted by a ghost. In the\r\nsame way deceased husbands come by night to harass their wives who have\r\nmade a second matrimonial venture, and I could easily name several who\r\nhave kept a better watch over their wives since death than they ever did\r\nwhile living.\r\n\r\n\"That sort of thing is blameworthy, for in all fairness the dead have no\r\nbusiness to stir up jealousies. Still I do but tell you what I have\r\nobserved myself. It is a matter to take into account if one marries a\r\nwidow. Besides, the tale I have told you is vouchsafed for in the\r\nmanner following:\r\n\r\n\"The morning after that extraordinary night Catherine Fontaine was\r\ndiscovered dead in her chamber. And the beadle attached to St. Eulalie\r\nfound in the copper bowl used for the collection a gold ring with two\r\nclasped hands. Besides, I'm not the kind of man to make jokes. Suppose\r\nwe order another bottle of wine?...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Was It?\r\n\r\nBY FITZ-JAMES O'BRIEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, I confess, with considerable diffidence, that I approach the\r\nstrange narrative which I am about to relate. The events which I purpose\r\ndetailing are of so extraordinary a character that I am quite prepared\r\nto meet with an unusual amount of incredulity and scorn. I accept all\r\nsuch beforehand. I have, I trust, the literary courage to face unbelief.\r\nI have, after mature consideration resolved to narrate, in as simple and\r\nstraightforward a manner as I can compass, some facts that passed under\r\nmy observation, in the month of July last, and which, in the annals of\r\nthe mysteries of physical science, are wholly unparalleled.\r\n\r\nI live at No. ---- Twenty-sixth Street, in New York. The house is in some\r\nrespects a curious one. It has enjoyed for the last two years the\r\nreputation of being haunted. It is a large and stately residence,\r\nsurrounded by what was once a garden, but which is now only a green\r\nenclosure used for bleaching clothes. The dry basin of what has been a\r\nfountain, and a few fruit trees ragged and unpruned, indicate that this\r\nspot in past days was a pleasant, shady retreat, filled with fruits and\r\nflowers and the sweet murmur of waters.\r\n\r\nThe house is very spacious. A hall of noble size leads to a large spiral\r\nstaircase winding through its center, while the various apartments are\r\nof imposing dimensions. It was built some fifteen or twenty years since\r\nby Mr. A----, the well-known New York merchant, who five years ago threw\r\nthe commercial world into convulsions by a stupendous bank fraud. Mr.\r\nA----, as everyone knows, escaped to Europe, and died not long after, of\r\na broken heart. Almost immediately after the news of his decease reached\r\nthis country and was verified, the report spread in Twenty-sixth Street\r\nthat No. ---- was haunted. Legal measures had dispossessed the widow of\r\nits former owner, and it was inhabited merely by a caretaker and his\r\nwife, placed there by the house agent into whose hands it had passed for\r\nthe purposes of renting or sale. These people declared that they were\r\ntroubled with unnatural noises. Doors were opened without any visible\r\nagency. The remnants of furniture scattered through the various rooms\r\nwere, during the night, piled one upon the other by unknown hands.\r\nInvisible feet passed up and down the stairs in broad daylight,\r\naccompanied by the rustle of unseen silk dresses, and the gliding of\r\nviewless hands along the massive balusters. The caretaker and his wife\r\ndeclared they would live there no longer. The house agent laughed,\r\ndismissed them, and put others in their place. The noises and\r\nsupernatural manifestations continued. The neighborhood caught up the\r\nstory, and the house remained untenanted for three years. Several\r\npersons negotiated for it; but, somehow, always before the bargain was\r\nclosed they heard the unpleasant rumors and declined to treat any\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nIt was in this state of things that my landlady, who at that time kept a\r\nboarding-house in Bleecker Street, and who wished to move further up\r\ntown, conceived the bold idea of renting No. ---- Twenty-sixth Street.\r\nHappening to have in her house rather a plucky and philosophical set of\r\nboarders, she laid her scheme before us, stating candidly everything she\r\nhad heard respecting the ghostly qualities of the establishment to which\r\nshe wished to remove us. With the exception of two timid persons,--a\r\nsea-captain and a returned Californian, who immediately gave notice that\r\nthey would leave,--all of Mrs. Moffat's guests declared that they would\r\naccompany her in her chivalric incursion into the abode of spirits.\r\n\r\nOur removal was effected in the month of May, and we were charmed with\r\nour new residence. The portion of Twenty-sixth Street where our house is\r\nsituated, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, is one of the pleasantest\r\nlocalities in New York. The gardens back of the houses, running down\r\nnearly to the Hudson, form, in the summer time, a perfect avenue of\r\nverdure. The air is pure and invigorating, sweeping, as it does,\r\nstraight across the river from the Weehawken heights, and even the\r\nragged garden which surrounded the house, although displaying on washing\r\ndays rather too much clothesline, still gave us a piece of greensward to\r\nlook at, and a cool retreat in the summer evenings, where we smoked our\r\ncigars in the dusk, and watched the fireflies flashing their dark\r\nlanterns in the long grass.\r\n\r\nOf course we had no sooner established ourselves at No. ---- than we\r\nbegan to expect ghosts. We absolutely awaited their advent with\r\neagerness. Our dinner conversation was supernatural. One of the\r\nboarders, who had purchased Mrs. Crowe's _Night Side of Nature_ for his\r\nown private delectation, was regarded as a public enemy by the entire\r\nhousehold for not having bought twenty copies. The man led a life of\r\nsupreme wretchedness while he was reading this volume. A system of\r\nespionage was established, of which he was the victim. If he\r\nincautiously laid the book down for an instant and left the room, it was\r\nimmediately seized and read aloud in secret places to a select few. I\r\nfound myself a person of immense importance, it having leaked out that I\r\nwas tolerably well versed in the history of supernaturalism, and had\r\nonce written a story the foundation of which was a ghost. If a table or\r\na wainscot panel happened to warp when we were assembled in the large\r\ndrawing-room, there was an instant silence, and everyone was prepared\r\nfor an immediate clanking of chains and a spectral form.\r\n\r\nAfter a month of psychological excitement, it was with the utmost\r\ndissatisfaction that we were forced to acknowledge that nothing in the\r\nremotest degree approaching the supernatural had manifested itself. Once\r\nthe black butler asseverated that his candle had been blown out by some\r\ninvisible agency while he was undressing himself for the night; but as I\r\nhad more than once discovered this colored gentleman in a condition when\r\none candle must have appeared to him like two, thought it possible that,\r\nby going a step further in his potations, he might have reversed this\r\nphenomenon, and seen no candle at all where he ought to have beheld one.\r\n\r\nThings were in this state when an accident took place so awful and\r\ninexplicable in its character that my reason fairly reels at the bare\r\nmemory of the occurrence. It was the tenth of July. After dinner was\r\nover I repaired, with my friend Dr. Hammond, to the garden to smoke my\r\nevening pipe. Independent of certain mental sympathies which existed\r\nbetween the Doctor and myself, we were linked together by a vice. We\r\nboth smoked opium. We knew each other's secret, and respected it. We\r\nenjoyed together that wonderful expansion of thought, that marvelous\r\nintensifying of the perceptive faculties, that boundless feeling of\r\nexistence when we seem to have points of contact with the whole\r\nuniverse,--in short, that unimaginable spiritual bliss, which I would\r\nnot surrender for a throne, and which I hope you, reader, will\r\nnever--never taste.\r\n\r\nThose hours of opium happiness which the Doctor and I spent together in\r\nsecret were regulated with a scientific accuracy. We did not blindly\r\nsmoke the drug of paradise, and leave our dreams to chance. While\r\nsmoking, we carefully steered our conversation through the brightest and\r\ncalmest channels of thought. We talked of the East, and endeavored to\r\nrecall the magical panorama of its glowing scenery. We criticized the\r\nmost sensuous poets,--those who painted life ruddy with health, brimming\r\nwith passion, happy in the possession of youth and strength and beauty.\r\nIf we talked of Shakespeare's _Tempest_, we lingered over Ariel, and\r\navoided Caliban. Like the Guebers, we turned our faces to the East, and\r\nsaw only the sunny side of the world.\r\n\r\nThis skillful coloring of our train of thought produced in our\r\nsubsequent visions a corresponding tone. The splendors of Arabian\r\nfairyland dyed our dreams. We paced the narrow strip of grass with the\r\ntread and port of kings. The song of the _Rana arborea_, while he clung\r\nto the bark of the ragged plum-tree, sounded like the strains of divine\r\nmusicians. Houses, walls, and streets melted like rain clouds, and\r\nvistas of unimaginable glory stretched away before us. It was a\r\nrapturous companionship. We enjoyed the vast delight more perfectly\r\nbecause, even in our most ecstatic moments, we were conscious of each\r\nother's presence. Our pleasures, while individual, were still twin,\r\nvibrating and moving in musical accord.\r\n\r\nOn the evening in question, the tenth of July, the Doctor and myself\r\ndrifted into an unusually metaphysical mood. We lit our large\r\nmeerschaums, filled with fine Turkish tobacco, in the core of which\r\nburned a little black nut of opium, that, like the nut in the fairy\r\ntale, held within its narrow limits wonders beyond the reach of kings;\r\nwe paced to and fro, conversing. A strange perversity dominated the\r\ncurrents of our thought. They would _not_ flow through the sun-lit\r\nchannels into which we strove to divert them. For some unaccountable\r\nreason, they constantly diverged into dark and lonesome beds, where a\r\ncontinual gloom brooded. It was in vain that, after our old fashion, we\r\nflung ourselves on the shores of the East, and talked of its gay\r\nbazaars, of the splendors of the time of Haroun, of harems and golden\r\npalaces. Black afreets continually arose from the depths of our talk,\r\nand expanded, like the one the fisherman released from the copper\r\nvessel, until they blotted everything bright from our vision.\r\nInsensibly, we yielded to the occult force that swayed us, and indulged\r\nin gloomy speculation. We had talked some time upon the proneness of the\r\nhuman mind to mysticism, and the almost universal love of the terrible,\r\nwhen Hammond suddenly said to me. \"What do you consider to be the\r\ngreatest element of terror?\"\r\n\r\nThe question puzzled me. That many things were terrible, I knew.\r\nStumbling over a corpse in the dark; beholding, as I once did, a woman\r\nfloating down a deep and rapid river, with wildly lifted arms, and\r\nawful, upturned face, uttering, as she drifted, shrieks that rent one's\r\nheart while we, spectators, stood frozen at a window which overhung the\r\nriver at a height of sixty feet, unable to make the slightest effort to\r\nsave her, but dumbly watching her last supreme agony and her\r\ndisappearance. A shattered wreck, with no life visible, encountered\r\nfloating listlessly on the ocean, is a terrible object, for it suggests\r\na huge terror, the proportions of which are veiled. But it now struck\r\nme, for the first time, that there must be one great and ruling\r\nembodiment of fear,--a King of Terrors, to which all others must\r\nsuccumb. What might it be? To what train of circumstances would it owe\r\nits existence?\r\n\r\n\"I confess, Hammond,\" I replied to my friend, \"I never considered the\r\nsubject before. That there must be one Something more terrible than any\r\nother thing, I feel. I cannot attempt, however, even the most vague\r\ndefinition.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am somewhat like you, Harry,\" he answered. \"I feel my capacity to\r\nexperience a terror greater than anything yet conceived by the human\r\nmind;--something combining in fearful and unnatural amalgamation\r\nhitherto supposed incompatible elements. The calling of the voices in\r\nBrockden Brown's novel of _Wieland_ is awful; so is the picture of the\r\nDweller of the Threshold, in Bulwer's _Zanoni_; but,\" he added, shaking\r\nhis head gloomily, \"there is something more horrible still than those.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Hammond,\" I rejoined, \"let us drop this kind of talk, for\r\nHeaven's sake! We shall suffer for it, depend on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what's the matter with me to-night,\" he replied, \"but my\r\nbrain is running upon all sorts of weird and awful thoughts. I feel as\r\nif I could write a story like Hoffman, to-night, if I were only master\r\nof a literary style.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we are going to be Hoffmanesque in our talk, I'm off to bed.\r\nOpium and nightmares should never be brought together. How sultry it is!\r\nGood-night, Hammond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Harry. Pleasant dreams to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To you, gloomy wretch, afreets, ghouls, and enchanters.\"\r\n\r\nWe parted, and each sought his respective chamber. I undressed quickly\r\nand got into bed, taking with me, according to my usual custom, a book,\r\nover which I generally read myself to sleep. I opened the volume as soon\r\nas I had laid my head upon the pillow, and instantly flung it to the\r\nother side of the room. It was Goudon's _History of Monsters_,--a\r\ncurious French work, which I had lately imported from Paris, but which,\r\nin the state of mind I had then reached, was anything but an agreeable\r\ncompanion. I resolved to go to sleep at once; so, turning down my gas\r\nuntil nothing but a little blue point of light glimmered on the top of\r\nthe tube, I composed myself to rest.\r\n\r\nThe room was in total darkness. The atom of gas that still remained\r\nalight did not illuminate a distance of three inches round the burner. I\r\ndesperately drew my arm across my eyes, as if to shut out even the\r\ndarkness, and tried to think of nothing. It was in vain. The confounded\r\nthemes touched on by Hammond in the garden kept obtruding themselves on\r\nmy brain. I battled against them. I erected ramparts of would-be\r\nblackness of intellect to keep them out. They still crowded upon me.\r\nWhile I was lying still as a corpse, hoping that by a perfect physical\r\ninaction I should hasten mental repose, an awful incident occurred. A\r\nSomething dropped, as it seemed, from the ceiling, plumb upon my chest,\r\nand the next instant I felt two bony hands encircling my throat,\r\nendeavoring to choke me.\r\n\r\nI am no coward, and am possessed of considerable physical strength. The\r\nsuddenness of the attack, instead of stunning me, strung every nerve to\r\nits highest tension. My body acted from instinct, before my brain had\r\ntime to realize the terrors of my position. In an instant I wound two\r\nmuscular arms around the creature, and squeezed it, with all the\r\nstrength of despair, against my chest. In a few seconds the bony hands\r\nthat had fastened on my throat loosened their hold, and I was free to\r\nbreathe once more. Then commenced a struggle of awful intensity.\r\nImmersed in the most profound darkness, totally ignorant of the nature\r\nof the Thing by which I was so suddenly attacked, finding my grasp\r\nslipping every moment, by reason, it seemed to me, of the entire\r\nnakedness of my assailant, bitten with sharp teeth in the shoulder,\r\nneck, and chest, having every moment to protect my throat against a pair\r\nof sinewy, agile hands, which my utmost efforts could not\r\nconfine,--these were a combination of circumstances to combat which\r\nrequired all the strength, skill, and courage that I possessed.\r\n\r\nAt last, after a silent, deadly, exhausting struggle, I got my assailant\r\nunder by a series of incredible efforts of strength. Once pinned, with\r\nmy knee on what I made out to be its chest, I knew that I was victor. I\r\nrested for a moment to breathe. I heard the creature beneath me panting\r\nin the darkness, and felt the violent throbbing of a heart. It was\r\napparently as exhausted as I was; that was one comfort. At this moment I\r\nremembered that I usually placed under my pillow, before going to bed, a\r\nlarge yellow silk pocket handkerchief. I felt for it instantly; it was\r\nthere. In a few seconds more I had, after a fashion, pinioned the\r\ncreature's arms.\r\n\r\nI now felt tolerably secure. There was nothing more to be done but to\r\nturn on the gas, and, having first seen what my midnight assailant was\r\nlike, arouse the household. I will confess to being actuated by a\r\ncertain pride in not giving the alarm before; I wished to make the\r\ncapture alone and unaided.\r\n\r\nNever losing my hold for an instant, I slipped from the bed to the\r\nfloor, dragging my captive with me. I had but a few steps to make to\r\nreach the gas-burner; these I made with the greatest caution, holding\r\nthe creature in a grip like a vice. At last I got within arm's length of\r\nthe tiny speck of blue light which told me where the gas-burner lay.\r\nQuick as lightning I released my grasp with one hand and let on the full\r\nflood of light. Then I turned to look at my captive.\r\n\r\nI cannot even attempt to give any definition of my sensations the\r\ninstant after I turned on the gas. I suppose I must have shrieked with\r\nterror, for in less than a minute afterward my room was crowded with the\r\ninmates of the house. I shudder now as I think of that awful moment. _I\r\nsaw nothing_! Yes; I had one arm firmly clasped round a breathing,\r\npanting, corporeal shape, my other hand gripped with all its strength a\r\nthroat as warm, as apparently fleshy, as my own; and yet, with this\r\nliving substance in my grasp, with its body pressed against my own, and\r\nall in the bright glare of a large jet of gas, I absolutely beheld\r\nnothing! Not even an outline,--a vapor!\r\n\r\nI do not, even at this hour, realize the situation in which I found\r\nmyself. I cannot recall the astounding incident thoroughly. Imagination\r\nin vain tries to compass the awful paradox.\r\n\r\nIt breathed. I felt its warm breath upon my cheek. It struggled\r\nfiercely. It had hands. They clutched me. Its skin was smooth, like my\r\nown. There it lay, pressed close up against me, solid as stone,--and\r\nyet utterly invisible!\r\n\r\nI wonder that I did not faint or go mad on the instant. Some wonderful\r\ninstinct must have sustained me; for, absolutely, in place of loosening\r\nmy hold on the terrible Enigma, I seemed to gain an additional strength\r\nin my moment of horror, and tightened my grasp with such wonderful force\r\nthat I felt the creature shivering with agony.\r\n\r\nJust then Hammond entered my room at the head of the household. As soon\r\nas he beheld my face--which, I suppose, must have been an awful sight to\r\nlook at--he hastened forward, crying, \"Great heaven, Harry! what has\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hammond! Hammond!\" I cried, \"come here. O, this is awful! I have been\r\nattacked in bed by something or other, which I have hold of; but I can't\r\nsee it,--I can't see it!\"\r\n\r\nHammond, doubtless struck by the unfeigned horror expressed in my\r\ncountenance, made one or two steps forward with an anxious yet puzzled\r\nexpression. A very audible titter burst from the remainder of my\r\nvisitors. This suppressed laughter made me furious. To laugh at a human\r\nbeing in my position! It was the worst species of cruelty. _Now_, I can\r\nunderstand why the appearance of a man struggling violently, as it would\r\nseem, with an airy nothing, and calling for assistance against a vision,\r\nshould have appeared ludicrous. _Then_, so great was my rage against the\r\nmocking crowd that had I the power I would have stricken them dead\r\nwhere they stood.\r\n\r\n\"Hammond! Hammond!\" I cried again, despairingly, \"for God's sake come to\r\nme. I can hold the--the thing but a short while longer. It is\r\noverpowering me. Help me! Help me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" whispered Hammond, approaching me, \"you have been smoking too\r\nmuch opium.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear to you, Hammond, that this is no vision,\" I answered, in the\r\nsame low tone. \"Don't you see how it shakes my whole frame with its\r\nstruggles? If you don't believe me, convince yourself. Feel it,--touch\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHammond advanced and laid his hand in the spot I indicated. A wild cry\r\nof horror burst from him. He had felt it!\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had discovered somewhere in my room a long piece of cord,\r\nand was the next instant winding it and knotting it about the body of\r\nthe unseen being that I clasped in my arms.\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" he said, in a hoarse, agitated voice, for, though he preserved\r\nhis presence of mind, he was deeply moved, \"Harry, it's all safe now.\r\nYou may let go, old fellow, if you're tired. The Thing can't move.\"\r\n\r\nI was utterly exhausted, and I gladly loosed my hold.\r\n\r\nHammond stood holding the ends of the cord that bound the Invisible,\r\ntwisted round his hand, while before him, self-supporting as it were, he\r\nbeheld a rope laced and interlaced, and stretching tightly around a\r\nvacant space. I never saw a man look so thoroughly stricken with awe.\r\nNevertheless his face expressed all the courage and determination which\r\nI knew him to possess. His lips, although white, were set firmly, and\r\none could perceive at a glance that, although stricken with fear, he was\r\nnot daunted.\r\n\r\nThe confusion that ensued among the guests of the house who were\r\nwitnesses of this extraordinary scene between Hammond and myself,--who\r\nbeheld the pantomime of binding this struggling Something,--who beheld\r\nme almost sinking from physical exhaustion when my task of jailer was\r\nover,--the confusion and terror that took possession of the bystanders,\r\nwhen they saw all this, was beyond description. The weaker ones fled\r\nfrom the apartment. The few who remained clustered near the door and\r\ncould not be induced to approach Hammond and his Charge. Still\r\nincredulity broke out through their terror. They had not the courage to\r\nsatisfy themselves, and yet they doubted. It was in vain that I begged\r\nof some of the men to come near and convince themselves by touch of the\r\nexistence in that room of a living being which was invisible. They were\r\nincredulous, but did not dare to undeceive themselves. How could a\r\nsolid, living, breathing body be invisible, they asked. My reply was\r\nthis. I gave a sign to Hammond, and both of us--conquering our fearful\r\nrepugnance to touch the invisible creature--lifted it from the ground,\r\nmanacled as it was, and took it to my bed. Its weight was about that of\r\na boy of fourteen.\r\n\r\n\"Now my friends,\" I said, as Hammond and myself held the creature\r\nsuspended over the bed, \"I can give you self-evident proof that here is\r\na solid, ponderable body, which, nevertheless, you cannot see. Be good\r\nenough to watch the surface of the bed attentively.\"\r\n\r\nI was astonished at my own courage in treating this strange event so\r\ncalmly; but I had recovered from my first terror, and felt a sort of\r\nscientific pride in the affair, which dominated every other feeling.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the bystanders were immediately fixed on my bed. At a given\r\nsignal Hammond and I let the creature fall. There was a dull sound of a\r\nheavy body alighting on a soft mass. The timbers of the bed creaked. A\r\ndeep impression marked itself distinctly on the pillow, and on the bed\r\nitself. The crowd who witnessed this gave a low cry, and rushed from the\r\nroom. Hammond and I were left alone with our Mystery.\r\n\r\nWe remained silent for some time, listening to the low, irregular\r\nbreathing of the creature on the bed, and watching the rustle of the\r\nbedclothes as it impotently struggled to free itself from confinement.\r\nThen Hammond spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Harry, this is awful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, awful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not unaccountable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unaccountable! What do you mean? Such a thing has never occurred\r\nsince the birth of the world. I know not what to think, Hammond. God\r\ngrant that I am not mad, and that this is not an insane fantasy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us reason a little, Harry. Here is a solid body which we touch, but\r\nwhich we cannot see. The fact is so unusual that it strikes us with\r\nterror. Is there no parallel, though, for such a phenomenon? Take a\r\npiece of pure glass. It is tangible and transparent. A certain chemical\r\ncoarseness is all that prevents its being so entirely transparent as to\r\nbe totally invisible. It is not _theoretically impossible_, mind you, to\r\nmake a glass which shall not reflect a single ray of light,--a glass so\r\npure and homogeneous in its atoms that the rays from the sun will pass\r\nthrough it as they do through the air, refracted but not reflected. We\r\ndo not see the air, and yet we feel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well, Hammond, but these are inanimate substances.\r\nGlass does not breathe, air does not breathe. _This_ thing has a heart\r\nthat palpitates,--a will that moves it,--lungs that play, and inspire\r\nand respire.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget the phenomena of which we have so often heard of late,\"\r\nanswered the Doctor, gravely. \"At the meetings called 'spirit circles,'\r\ninvisible hands have been thrust into the hands of those persons round\r\nthe table,--warm, fleshly hands that seemed to pulsate with mortal\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Do you think, then, that this thing is----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what it is,\" was the solemn reply; \"but please the gods I\r\nwill, with your assistance, thoroughly investigate it.\"\r\n\r\nWe watched together, smoking many pipes, all night long, by the bedside\r\nof the unearthly being that tossed and panted until it was apparently\r\nwearied out. Then we learned by the low, regular breathing that it\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the house was all astir. The boarders congregated on\r\nthe landing outside my room, and Hammond and myself were lions. We had\r\nto answer a thousand questions as to the state of our extraordinary\r\nprisoner, for as yet not one person in the house except ourselves could\r\nbe induced to set foot in the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe creature was awake. This was evidenced by the convulsive manner in\r\nwhich the bedclothes were moved in its efforts to escape. There was\r\nsomething truly terrible in beholding, as it were, those second-hand\r\nindications of the terrible writhings and agonized struggles for liberty\r\nwhich themselves were invisible.\r\n\r\nHammond and myself had racked our brains during the long night to\r\ndiscover some means by which we might realize the shape and general\r\nappearance of the Enigma. As well as we could make out by passing our\r\nhands over the creature's form, its outlines and lineaments were human.\r\nThere was a mouth; a round, smooth head without hair; a nose, which,\r\nhowever, was little elevated above the cheeks; and its hands and feet\r\nfelt like those of a boy. At first we thought of placing the being on a\r\nsmooth surface and tracing its outlines with chalk, as shoemakers trace\r\nthe outline of the foot. This plan was given up as being of no value.\r\nSuch an outline would give not the slightest idea of its conformation.\r\n\r\nA happy thought struck me. We would take a cast of it in plaster of\r\nParis. This would give us the solid figure, and satisfy all our wishes.\r\nBut how to do it? The movements of the creature would disturb the\r\nsetting of the plastic covering, and distort the mold. Another thought.\r\nWhy not give it chloroform? It had respiratory organs,--that was evident\r\nby its breathing. Once reduced to a state of insensibility, we could do\r\nwith it what we would. Doctor X---- was sent for; and after the worthy\r\nphysician had recovered from the first shock of amazement, he proceeded\r\nto administer the chloroform. In three minutes afterward we were enabled\r\nto remove the fetters from the creature's body, and a modeler was busily\r\nengaged in covering the invisible form with the moist clay. In five\r\nminutes more we had a mold, and before evening a rough facsimile of the\r\nMystery. It was shaped like a man--distorted, uncouth, and horrible, but\r\nstill a man. It was small, not over four feet and some inches in height,\r\nand its limbs revealed a muscular development that was unparalleled. Its\r\nface surpassed in hideousness anything I had ever seen. Gustav Doré, or\r\nCallot, or Tony Johannot, never conceived anything so horrible. There\r\nis a face in one of the latter's illustrations to _Un Voyage où il vous\r\nplaira_, which somewhat approaches the countenance of this creature, but\r\ndoes not equal it. It was the physiognomy of what I should fancy a ghoul\r\nmight be. It looked as if it was capable of feeding on human flesh.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied our curiosity, and bound every one in the house to\r\nsecrecy, it became a question what was to be done with our Enigma? It\r\nwas impossible that we should keep such a horror in our house; it was\r\nequally impossible that such an awful being should be let loose upon the\r\nworld. I confess that I would have gladly voted for the creature's\r\ndestruction. But who would shoulder the responsibility? Who would\r\nundertake the execution of this horrible semblance of a human being? Day\r\nafter day this question was deliberated gravely. The boarders all left\r\nthe house. Mrs. Moffat was in despair, and threatened Hammond and myself\r\nwith all sorts of legal penalties if we did not remove the Horror. Our\r\nanswer was, \"We will go if you like, but we decline taking this creature\r\nwith us. Remove it yourself if you please. It appeared in your house. On\r\nyou the responsibility rests.\" To this there was, of course, no answer.\r\nMrs. Moffat could not obtain for love or money a person who would even\r\napproach the Mystery.\r\n\r\nThe most singular part of the affair was that we were entirely ignorant\r\nof what the creature habitually fed on. Everything in the way of\r\nnutriment that we could think of was placed before it, but was never\r\ntouched. It was awful to stand by, day after day, and see the clothes\r\ntoss, and hear the hard breathing, and know that it was starving.\r\n\r\nTen, twelve days, a fortnight passed, and it still lived. The pulsations\r\nof the heart, however, were daily growing fainter, and had now nearly\r\nceased. It was evident that the creature was dying for want of\r\nsustenance. While this terrible life-struggle was going on, I felt\r\nmiserable. I could not sleep. Horrible as the creature was, it was\r\npitiful to think of the pangs it was suffering.\r\n\r\nAt last it died. Hammond and I found it cold and stiff one morning in\r\nthe bed. The heart had ceased to beat, the lungs to inspire. We hastened\r\nto bury it in the garden. It was a strange funeral, the dropping of that\r\nviewless corpse into the damp hole. The cast of its form I gave to\r\nDoctor X----, who keeps it in his museum in Tenth Street.\r\n\r\nAs I am on the eve of a long journey from which I may not return, I have\r\ndrawn up this narrative of an event the most singular that has ever come\r\nto my knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Middle Toe of the Right Foot\r\n\r\nBY AMBROSE BIERCE\r\n\r\n     From _Can Such Things Be?_ by Ambrose Bierce. Copyright by the\r\n     Neale Publishing Company. By permission of the publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the old Manton house is haunted. In all the rural\r\ndistrict near about, and even in the town of Marshall, a mile away, not\r\none person of unbiased mind entertains a doubt of it; incredulity is\r\nconfined to those opinionated persons who will be called \"cranks\" as\r\nsoon as the useful word shall have penetrated the intellectual demesne\r\nof the Marshall _Advance_. The evidence that the house is haunted is of\r\ntwo kinds; the testimony of disinterested witnesses who have had ocular\r\nproof, and that of the house itself. The former may be disregarded and\r\nruled out on any of the various grounds of objection which may be urged\r\nagainst it by the ingenious; but facts within the observation of all are\r\nmaterial and controlling.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the Manton house has been unoccupied by mortals for\r\nmore than ten years, and with its outbuildings is slowly falling into\r\ndecay--a circumstance which in itself the judicious will hardly venture\r\nto ignore. It stands a little way off the loneliest reach of the\r\nMarshall and Harriston road, in an opening which was once a farm and is\r\nstill disfigured with strips of rotting fence and half covered with\r\nbrambles overrunning a stony and sterile soil long unacquainted with the\r\nplow. The house itself is in tolerably good condition, though badly\r\nweather-stained and in dire need of attention from the glazier, the\r\nsmaller male population of the region having attested in the manner of\r\nits kind its disapproval of dwelling without dwellers. It is two stories\r\nin height, nearly square, its front pierced by a single doorway flanked\r\non each side by a window boarded up to the very top. Corresponding\r\nwindows above, not protected, serve to admit light and rain to the rooms\r\nof the upper floor. Grass and weeds grow pretty rankly all about, and a\r\nfew shade trees, somewhat the worse for wind, and leaning all in one\r\ndirection, seem to be making a concerted effort to run away. In short,\r\nas the Marshall town humorist explained in the columns of the _Advance_,\r\n\"the proposition that the Manton house is badly haunted is the only\r\nlogical conclusion from the premises.\" The fact that in this dwelling\r\nMr. Manton thought it expedient one night some ten years ago to rise and\r\ncut the throats of his wife and two small children, removing at once to\r\nanother part of the country, has no doubt done its share in directing\r\npublic attention to the fitness of the place for supernatural phenomena.\r\n\r\nTo this house, one summer evening, came four men in a wagon. Three of\r\nthem promptly alighted, and the one who had been driving hitched the\r\nteam to the only remaining post of what had been a fence. The fourth\r\nremained seated in the wagon. \"Come,\" said one of his companions,\r\napproaching him, while the others moved away in the direction of the\r\ndwelling--\"this is the place.\"\r\n\r\nThe man addressed did not move. \"By God!\" he said harshly, \"this is a\r\ntrick, and it looks to me as if you were in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am,\" the other said, looking him straight in the face and\r\nspeaking in a tone which had something of contempt in it. \"You will\r\nremember, however, that the choice of place was with your own assent\r\nleft to the other side. Of course if you are afraid of spooks--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid of nothing,\" the man interrupted with another oath, and\r\nsprang to the ground. The two then joined the others at the door, which\r\none of them had already opened with some difficulty, caused by rust of\r\nlock and hinge. All entered. Inside it was dark, but the man who had\r\nunlocked the door produced a candle and matches and made a light. He\r\nthen unlocked a door on their right as they stood in the passage. This\r\ngave them entrance to a large, square room that the candle but dimly\r\nlighted. The floor had a thick carpeting of dust, which partly muffled\r\ntheir footfalls. Cobwebs were in the angles of the walls and depended\r\nfrom the ceiling like strips of rotting lace making undulatory movements\r\nin the disturbed air. The room had two windows in adjoining sides, but\r\nfrom neither could anything be seen except the rough inner surfaces of\r\nboards a few inches from the glass. There was no fireplace, no\r\nfurniture; there was nothing: besides the cobwebs and the dust, the four\r\nmen were the only objects there which were not a part of the structure.\r\n\r\nStrange enough they looked in the yellow light of the candle. The one\r\nwho had so reluctantly alighted was especially spectacular--he might\r\nhave been called sensational. He was of middle age, heavily built, deep\r\nchested, and broad shouldered. Looking at his figure, one would have\r\nsaid that he had a giant's strength; at his features, that he would use\r\nit like a giant. He was clean shaven, his hair rather closely cropped\r\nand gray. His low forehead was seamed with wrinkles above the eyes, and\r\nover the nose these became vertical. The heavy black brows followed the\r\nsame law, saved from meeting only by an upward turn at what would\r\notherwise have been the point of contact. Deeply sunken beneath these,\r\nglowed in the obscure light a pair of eyes of uncertain color, but\r\nobviously enough too small. There was something forbidding in their\r\nexpression, which was not bettered by the cruel mouth and wide jaw. The\r\nnose was well enough, as noses go; one does not expect much of noses.\r\nAll that was sinister in the man's face seemed accentuated by an\r\nunnatural pallor--he appeared altogether bloodless.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the other men was sufficiently commonplace; they were\r\nsuch persons as one meets and forgets that he met. All were younger than\r\nthe man described, between whom and the eldest of the others, who stood\r\napart, there was apparently no kindly feeling. They avoided looking at\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the man holding the candle and keys, \"I believe\r\neverything is right. Are you ready, Mr. Rosser?\"\r\n\r\nThe man standing apart from the group bowed and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"And you, Mr. Grossmith?\"\r\n\r\nThe heavy man bowed and scowled.\r\n\r\n\"You will be pleased to remove your outer clothing.\"\r\n\r\nTheir hats, coats, waistcoats, and neckwear were soon removed and thrown\r\noutside the door, in the passage. The man with the candle now nodded,\r\nand the fourth man--he who had urged Grossmith to leave the\r\nwagon--produced from the pocket of his overcoat two long,\r\nmurderous-looking bowie-knives, which he drew now from their leather\r\nscabbards.\r\n\r\n\"They are exactly alike,\" he said, presenting one to each of the two\r\nprincipals--for by this time the dullest observer would have understood\r\nthe nature of this meeting. It was to be a duel to the death.\r\n\r\nEach combatant took a knife, examined it critically near the candle and\r\ntested the strength of the blade and handle across his lifted knee. Their\r\npersons were then searched in turn, each by the second of the other.\r\n\r\n\"If it is agreeable to you, Mr. Grossmith,\" said the man holding the\r\nlight, \"you will place yourself in that corner.\"\r\n\r\nHe indicated the angle of the room farthest from the door, whither\r\nGrossmith retired, his second parting from him with a grasp of the hand\r\nwhich had nothing of cordiality in it. In the angle nearest the door Mr.\r\nRosser stationed himself, and after a whispered consultation his second\r\nleft him, joining the other near the door. At that moment the candle was\r\nsuddenly extinguished, leaving all in profound darkness. This may have\r\nbeen done by a draught from the opened door; whatever the cause, the\r\neffect was startling.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said a voice which sounded strangely unfamiliar in the\r\naltered condition affecting the relations of the senses--\"gentlemen, you\r\nwill not move until you hear the closing of the outer door.\"\r\n\r\nA sound of trampling ensued, then the closing of the inner door; and\r\nfinally the outer one closed with a concussion which shook the entire\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterward a belated farmer's boy met a light wagon which\r\nwas being driven furiously toward the town of Marshall. He declared that\r\nbehind the two figures on the front seat stood a third, with its hands\r\nupon the bowed shoulders of the others, who appeared to struggle vainly\r\nto free themselves from its grasp. This figure, unlike the others, was\r\nclad in white, and had undoubtedly boarded the wagon as it passed the\r\nhaunted house. As the lad could boast a considerable former experience\r\nwith the supernatural thereabouts his word had the weight justly due to\r\nthe testimony of an expert. The story (in connection with the next day's\r\nevents) eventually appeared in the _Advance_, with some slight literary\r\nembellishments and a concluding intimation that the gentlemen referred\r\nto would be allowed the use of the paper's columns for their version of\r\nthe night's adventure. But the privilege remained without a claimant.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe events that led up to this \"duel in the dark\" were simple enough.\r\nOne evening three young men of the town of Marshall were sitting in a\r\nquiet corner of the porch of the village hotel, smoking and discussing\r\nsuch matters as three educated young men of a Southern village would\r\nnaturally find interesting. Their names were King, Sancher, and Rosser.\r\nAt a little distance, within easy hearing, but taking no part in the\r\nconversation, sat a fourth. He was a stranger to the others. They\r\nmerely knew that on his arrival by the stage-coach that afternoon he had\r\nwritten in the hotel register the name of Robert Grossmith. He had not\r\nbeen observed to speak to anyone except the hotel clerk. He seemed,\r\nindeed, singularly fond of his own company--or, as the _personnel_ of\r\nthe _Advance_ expressed it, \"grossly addicted to evil associations.\" But\r\nthen it should be said in justice to the stranger that the _personnel_\r\nwas himself of a too convivial disposition fairly to judge one\r\ndifferently gifted, and had, moreover, experienced a slight rebuff in an\r\neffort at an \"interview.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate any kind of deformity in a woman,\" said King, \"whether natural\r\nor--acquired. I have a theory that any physical defect has its\r\ncorrelative mental and moral defect.\"\r\n\r\n\"I infer, then,\" said Rosser, gravely, \"that a lady lacking the moral\r\nadvantage of a nose would find the struggle to become Mrs. King an\r\narduous enterprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you may put it that way,\" was the reply; \"but, seriously, I\r\nonce threw over a most charming girl on learning quite accidentally that\r\nshe had suffered amputation of a toe. My conduct was brutal if you like,\r\nbut if I had married that girl I should have been miserable for life and\r\nshould have made her so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereas,\" said Sancher, with a light laugh, \"by marrying a gentleman of\r\nmore liberal view she escaped with a parted throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you know to whom I refer. Yes, she married Manton, but I don't know\r\nabout his liberality; I'm not sure but he cut her throat because he\r\ndiscovered that she lacked that excellent thing in woman, the middle toe\r\nof the right foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at that chap!\" said Rosser in a low voice, his eyes fixed upon the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThat chap was obviously listening intently to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Damn his impudence!\" muttered King--\"what ought we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an easy one,\" Rosser replied, rising. \"Sir,\" he continued,\r\naddressing the stranger, \"I think it would be better if you would remove\r\nyour chair to the other end of the veranda. The presence of gentlemen is\r\nevidently an unfamiliar situation to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe man sprang to his feet and strode forward with clenched hands, his\r\nface white with rage. All were now standing. Sancher stepped between the\r\nbelligerents.\r\n\r\n\"You are hasty and unjust,\" he said to Rosser; \"this gentleman has done\r\nnothing to deserve such language.\"\r\n\r\nBut Rosser would not withdraw a word. By the custom of the country and\r\nthe time there could be but one outcome to the quarrel.\r\n\r\n\"I demand the satisfaction due to a gentleman,\" said the stranger, who\r\nhad become more calm. \"I have not an acquaintance in this region.\r\nPerhaps you, sir,\" bowing to Sancher, \"will be kind enough to represent\r\nme in this matter.\"\r\n\r\nSancher accepted the trust--somewhat reluctantly it must be confessed,\r\nfor the man's appearance and manner were not at all to his liking. King,\r\nwho during the colloquy had hardly removed his eyes from the stranger's\r\nface and had not spoken a word, consented with a nod to act for Rosser,\r\nand the upshot of it was that, the principals having retired, a meeting\r\nwas arranged for the next evening. The nature of the arrangements has\r\nbeen already disclosed. The duel with knives in a dark room was once a\r\ncommoner feature of Southwestern life than it is likely to be again. How\r\nthin a veneering of \"chivalry\" covered the essential brutality of the\r\ncode under which such encounters were possible we shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the blaze of a midsummer noonday the old Manton house was hardly true\r\nto its traditions. It was of the earth, earthy. The sunshine caressed it\r\nwarmly and affectionately, with evident disregard of its bad reputation.\r\nThe grass greening all the expanse in its front seemed to grow, not\r\nrankly, but with a natural and joyous exuberance, and the weeds\r\nblossomed quite like plants. Full of charming lights and shadows and\r\npopulous with pleasant-voiced birds, the neglected shade trees no longer\r\nstruggled to run away, but bent reverently beneath their burdens of sun\r\nand song. Even in the glassless upper windows was an expression of peace\r\nand contentment, due to the light within. Over the stony fields the\r\nvisible heat danced with a lively tremor incompatible with the gravity\r\nwhich is an attribute of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nSuch was the aspect under which the place presented itself to Sheriff\r\nAdams and two other men who had come out from Marshall to look at it.\r\nOne of these men was Mr. King, the sheriff's deputy; the other, whose\r\nname was Brewer, was a brother of the late Mrs. Manton. Under a\r\nbeneficent law of the State relating to property which has been for a\r\ncertain period abandoned by an owner whose residence cannot be\r\nascertained, the sheriff was legal custodian of the Manton farm and\r\nappurtenances thereunto belonging. His present visit was in mere\r\nperfunctory compliance with some order of a court in which Mr. Brewer\r\nhad an action to get possession of the property as heir to his deceased\r\nsister. By a mere coincidence, the visit was made on the day after the\r\nnight that Deputy King had unlocked the house for another and very\r\ndifferent purpose. His presence now was not of his own choosing: he had\r\nbeen ordered to accompany his superior, and at the moment could think of\r\nnothing more prudent than simulated alacrity in obedience to the\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nCarelessly opening the front door, which to his surprise was not locked,\r\nthe sheriff was amazed to see, lying on the floor of the passage into\r\nwhich it opened, a confused heap of men's apparel. Examination showed it\r\nto consist of two hats, and the same number of coats, waistcoats, and\r\nscarves all in a remarkably good state of preservation, albeit somewhat\r\ndefiled by the dust in which they lay. Mr. Brewer was equally\r\nastonished, but Mr. King's emotion is not of record. With a new and\r\nlively interest in his own actions the sheriff now unlatched and pushed\r\nopen a door on the right, and the three entered. The room was apparently\r\nvacant--no; as their eyes became accustomed to the dimmer light\r\nsomething was visible in the farthest angle of the wall. It was a human\r\nfigure--that of a man crouching close in the corner. Something in the\r\nattitude made the intruders halt when they had barely passed the\r\nthreshold. The figure more and more clearly defined itself. The man was\r\nupon one knee, his back in the angle of the wall, his shoulders elevated\r\nto the level of his ears, his hands before his face, palms outward, the\r\nfingers spread and crooked like claws; the white face turned upward on\r\nthe retracted neck had an expression of unutterable fright, the mouth\r\nhalf open, the eyes incredibly expanded. He was stone dead. Yet with the\r\nexception of a bowie-knife, which had evidently fallen from his own\r\nhand, not another object was in the room.\r\n\r\nIn thick dust that covered the floor were some confused footprints near\r\nthe door and along the wall through which it opened. Along one of the\r\nadjoining walls, too, past the boarded-up windows was the trail made by\r\nthe man himself in reaching his corner. Instinctively in approaching the\r\nbody the three men followed that trail. The sheriff grasped one of the\r\noutthrown arms; it was as rigid as iron, and the application of a gentle\r\nforce rocked the entire body without altering the relation of its parts.\r\nBrewer, pale with excitement, gazed intently into the distorted face.\r\n\"God of mercy!\" he suddenly cried, \"it is Manton!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said King, with an evident attempt at calmness: \"I knew\r\nManton. He then wore a full beard and his hair long, but this is he.\"\r\n\r\nHe might have added: \"I recognized him when he challenged Rosser. I told\r\nRosser and Sancher who he was before we played him this horrible trick.\r\nWhen Rosser left this dark room at our heels, forgetting his outer\r\nclothing in the excitement, and driving away with us in his shirt\r\nsleeves--all through the discreditable proceedings we knew with whom we\r\nwere dealing, murderer and coward that he was!\"\r\n\r\nBut nothing of this did Mr. King say. With his better light he was\r\ntrying to penetrate the mystery of the man's death. That he had not once\r\nmoved from the corner where he had been stationed; that his posture was\r\nthat of neither attack nor defense; that he had dropped his weapon; that\r\nhe had obviously perished of sheer horror of something that he\r\n_saw_--these were circumstances which Mr. King's disturbed intelligence\r\ncould not rightly comprehend.\r\n\r\nGroping in intellectual darkness for a clew to his maze of doubt, his\r\ngaze, directed mechanically downward in the way of one who ponders\r\nmomentous matters, fell upon something which, there, in the light of day\r\nand in the presence of living companions, affected him with terror. In\r\nthe dust of years that lay thick upon the floor--leading from the door\r\nby which they had entered, straight across the room to within a yard of\r\nManton's crouching corpse--were three parallel lines of\r\nfootprints--light but definite impressions of bare feet, the outer ones\r\nthose of small children, the inner a woman's. From the point at which\r\nthey ended they did not return; they pointed all one way. Brewer, who\r\nhad observed them at the same moment, was leaning forward in an attitude\r\nof rapt attention, horribly pale.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that!\" he cried, pointing with both hands at the nearest print\r\nof the woman's right foot, where she had apparently stopped and stood.\r\n\"The middle toe is missing--it was Gertrude!\"\r\n\r\nGertrude was the late Mrs. Manton, sister to Mr. Brewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shell of Sense\r\n\r\nBY OLIVIA HOWARD DUNBAR\r\n\r\n     From Harper's Magazine, December, 1908. By permission of Harper and\r\n     Brothers and Olivia Howard Dunbar.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was intolerably unchanged, the dim, dark-toned room. In an agony of\r\nrecognition my glance ran from one to another of the comfortable,\r\nfamiliar things that my earthly life had been passed among. Incredibly\r\ndistant from it all as I essentially was. I noted sharply that the very\r\ngaps that I myself had left in my bookshelves still stood unfilled; that\r\nthe delicate fingers of the ferns that I had tended were still stretched\r\nfutilely toward the light; that the soft agreeable chuckle of my own\r\nlittle clock, like some elderly woman with whom conversation has become\r\nautomatic, was undiminished.\r\n\r\nUnchanged--or so it seemed at first. But there were certain trivial\r\ndifferences that shortly smote me. The windows were closed too tightly;\r\nfor I had always kept the house very cool, although I had known that\r\nTheresa preferred warm rooms. And my work-basket was in disorder; it was\r\npreposterous that so small a thing should hurt me so. Then, for this was\r\nmy first experience of the shadow-folded transition, the odd alteration\r\nof my emotions bewildered me. For at one moment the place seemed so\r\nhumanly familiar, so distinctly my own proper envelope, that for love of\r\nit I could have laid my cheek against the wall; while in the next I was\r\nmiserably conscious of strange new shrillnesses. How could they be\r\nendured--and had I ever endured them?--those harsh influences that I now\r\nperceived at the window; light and color so blinding that they obscured\r\nthe form of the wind, tumult so discordant that one could scarcely hear\r\nthe roses open in the garden below?\r\n\r\nBut Theresa did not seem to mind any of these things. Disorder, it is\r\ntrue, the dear child had never minded. She was sitting all this time at\r\nmy desk--at _my_ desk--occupied, I could only too easily surmise how. In\r\nthe light of my own habits of precision it was plain that that sombre\r\ncorrespondence should have been attended to before; but I believe that I\r\ndid not really reproach Theresa, for I knew that her notes, when she did\r\nwrite them, were perhaps less perfunctory than mine. She finished the\r\nlast one as I watched her, and added it to the heap of black-bordered\r\nenvelopes that lay on the desk. Poor girl! I saw now that they had cost\r\nher tears. Yet, living beside her day after day, year after year, I had\r\nnever discovered what deep tenderness my sister possessed. Toward each\r\nother it had been our habit to display only a temperate affection, and I\r\nremember having always thought it distinctly fortunate for Theresa,\r\nsince she was denied my happiness, that she could live so easily and\r\npleasantly without emotions of the devastating sort.... And now, for the\r\nfirst time, I was really to behold her.... Could it be Theresa, after\r\nall, this tangle of subdued turbulences? Let no one suppose that it is\r\nan easy thing to bear, the relentlessly lucid understanding that I then\r\nfirst exercised; or that, in its first enfranchisement, the timid vision\r\ndoes not yearn for its old screens and mists.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as Theresa sat there, her head, filled with its tender\r\nthoughts of me, held in her gentle hands, I felt Allan's step on the\r\ncarpeted stair outside. Theresa felt it, too,--but how? for it was not\r\naudible. She gave a start, swept the black envelopes out of sight, and\r\npretended to be writing in a little book. Then I forgot to watch her any\r\nlonger in my absorption in Allan's coming. It was he, of course, that I\r\nwas awaiting. It was for him that I had made this first lonely,\r\nfrightened effort to return, to recover.... It was not that I had\r\nsupposed he would allow himself to recognize my presence, for I had long\r\nbeen sufficiently familiar with his hard and fast denials of the\r\ninvisible. He was so reasonable always, so sane--so blindfolded. But I\r\nhad hoped that because of his very rejection of the ether that now\r\ncontained me I could perhaps all the more safely, the more secretly,\r\nwatch him, linger near him. He was near now, very near,--but why did\r\nTheresa, sitting there in the room that had never belonged to her,\r\nappropriate for herself his coming? It was so manifestly I who had\r\ndrawn him, I whom he had come to seek.\r\n\r\nThe door was ajar. He knocked softly at it \"Are you there, Theresa?\" he\r\ncalled. He expected to find her, then, there in my room? I shrank back,\r\nfearing, almost, to stay.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have finished in a moment,\" Theresa told him, and he sat down\r\nto wait for her.\r\n\r\nNo spirit still unreleased can understand the pang that I felt with\r\nAllan sitting almost within my touch. Almost irresistibly the wish beset\r\nme to let him for an instant feel my nearness. Then I checked myself,\r\nremembering--oh, absurd, piteous human fears!--that my too unguarded\r\ncloseness might alarm him. It was not so remote a time that I myself had\r\nknown them, those blind, uncouth timidities. I came, therefore, somewhat\r\nnearer--but I did not touch him. I merely leaned toward him and with\r\nincredible softness whispered his name. That much I could not have\r\nforborne; the spell of life was still too strong in me.\r\n\r\nBut it gave him no comfort, no delight. \"Theresa!\" he called, in a voice\r\ndreadful with alarm--and in that instant the last veil fell, and\r\ndesperately, scarce believingly, I beheld how it stood between them,\r\nthose two.\r\n\r\nShe turned to him that gentle look of hers.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me,\" came from him hoarsely. \"But I had suddenly the\r\nmost--unaccountable sensation. Can there be too many windows open? There\r\nis such a--chill--about.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no windows open,\" Theresa assured him. \"I took care to shut\r\nout the chill. You are not well, Allan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not.\" He embraced the suggestion. \"And yet I feel no illness\r\napart from this abominable sensation that persists--persists....\r\nTheresa, you must tell me: do I fancy it, or do you, too,\r\nfeel--something--strange here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there is something very strange here,\" she half sobbed. \"There\r\nalways will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, child, I didn't mean that!\" He rose and stood looking\r\nabout him. \"I know, of course, that you have your beliefs, and I respect\r\nthem, but you know equally well that I have nothing of the sort!\r\nSo--don't let us conjure up anything inexplicable.\"\r\n\r\nI stayed impalpably, imponderably near him. Wretched and bereft though I\r\nwas, I could not have left him while he stood denying me.\r\n\r\n\"What I mean,\" he went on, in his low, distinct voice, \"is a special, an\r\nalmost ominous sense of cold. Upon my soul, Theresa,\"--he paused--\"if I\r\n_were_ superstitious, if I _were_ a woman, I should probably imagine it\r\nto seem--a presence!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke the last word very faintly, but Theresa shrank from it\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"_Don't_ say that, Allan!\" she cried out. \"Don't think it, I beg of you!\r\nI've tried so hard myself not to think it--and you must help me. You\r\nknow it is only perturbed, uneasy spirits that wander. With her it is\r\nquite different. She has always been so happy--she must still be.\"\r\n\r\nI listened, stunned, to Theresa's sweet dogmatism. From what blind\r\ndistances came her confident misapprehensions, how dense, both for her\r\nand for Allan, was the separating vapor!\r\n\r\nAllan frowned. \"Don't take me literally, Theresa,\" he explained; and I,\r\nwho a moment before had almost touched him, now held myself aloof and\r\nheard him with a strange untried pity, new born in me. \"I'm not speaking\r\nof what you call--spirits. It's something much more terrible.\" He\r\nallowed his head to sink heavily on his chest. \"If I did not positively\r\nknow that I had never done her any harm, I should suppose myself to be\r\nsuffering from guilt, from remorse.... Theresa, you know better than I,\r\nperhaps. Was she content, always? Did she believe in me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Believe in you?--when she knew you to be so good!--when you adored\r\nher!\"\r\n\r\n\"She thought that? She said it? Then what in Heaven's name ails\r\nme?--unless it is all as you believe, Theresa, and she knows now what\r\nshe didn't know then, poor dear, and minds----\"\r\n\r\n\"Minds what? What do you mean, Allan?\"\r\n\r\nI, who with my perhaps illegitimate advantage saw so clear, knew that he\r\nhad not meant to tell her: I did him that justice, even in my first\r\njealousy. If I had not tortured him so by clinging near him, he would\r\nnot have told her. But the moment came, and overflowed, and he did tell\r\nher--passionate, tumultuous story that it was. During all our life\r\ntogether, Allan's and mine, he had spared me, had kept me wrapped in the\r\nwhite cloak of an unblemished loyalty. But it would have been kinder, I\r\nnow bitterly thought, if, like many husbands, he had years ago found for\r\nthe story he now poured forth some clandestine listener; I should not\r\nhave known. But he was faithful and good, and so he waited till I, mute\r\nand chained, was there to hear him. So well did I know him, as I\r\nthought, so thoroughly had he once been mine, that I saw it in his eyes,\r\nheard it in his voice, before the words came. And yet, when it came, it\r\nlashed me with the whips of an unbearable humiliation. For I, his wife,\r\nhad not known how greatly he could love.\r\n\r\nAnd that Theresa, soft little traitor, should, in her still way, have\r\ncared too! Where was the iron in her, I moaned within my stricken\r\nspirit, where the steadfastness? From the moment he bade her, she turned\r\nher soft little petals up to him--and my last delusion was spent. It was\r\nintolerable; and none the less so that in another moment she had,\r\nprompted by some belated thought of me, renounced him. Allan was hers,\r\nyet she put him from her; and it was my part to watch them both.\r\n\r\nThen in the anguish of it all I remembered, awkward, untutored spirit\r\nthat I was, that I now had the Great Recourse. Whatever human things\r\nwere unbearable, I had no need to bear. I ceased, therefore, to make\r\nthe effort that kept me with them. The pitiless poignancy was dulled,\r\nthe sounds and the light ceased, the lovers faded from me, and again I\r\nwas mercifully drawn into the dim, infinite spaces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere followed a period whose length I cannot measure and during which I\r\nwas able to make no progress in the difficult, dizzying experience of\r\nrelease. \"Earth-bound\" my jealousy relentlessly kept me. Though my two\r\ndear ones had forsworn each other, I could not trust them, for theirs\r\nseemed to me an affectation of a more than mortal magnanimity. Without a\r\nghostly sentinel to prick them with sharp fears and recollections, who\r\ncould believe that they would keep to it? Of the efficacy of my own\r\nvigilance, so long as I might choose to exercise it, I could have no\r\ndoubt, for I had by this time come to have a dreadful exultation in the\r\nnew power that lived in me. Repeated delicate experiment had taught me\r\nhow a touch or a breath, a wish or a whisper, could control Allan's\r\nacts, could keep him from Theresa. I could manifest myself as palely, as\r\ntransiently, as a thought. I could produce the merest necessary flicker,\r\nlike the shadow of a just-opened leaf, on his trembling, tortured\r\nconsciousness. And these unrealized perceptions of me he interpreted, as\r\nI had known that he would, as his soul's inevitable penance. He had come\r\nto believe that he had done evil in silently loving Theresa all these\r\nyears, and it was my vengeance to allow him to believe this, to prod\r\nhim ever to believe it afresh.\r\n\r\nI am conscious that this frame of mind was not continuous in me. For I\r\nremember, too, that when Allan and Theresa were safely apart and\r\nsufficiently miserable I loved them as dearly as I ever had, more dearly\r\nperhaps. For it was impossible that I should not perceive, in my new\r\nemancipation, that they were, each of them, something more and greater\r\nthan the two beings I had once ignorantly pictured them. For years they\r\nhad practiced a selflessness of which I could once scarcely have\r\nconceived, and which even now I could only admire without entering into\r\nits mystery. While I had lived solely for myself, these two divine\r\ncreatures had lived exquisitely for me. They had granted me everything,\r\nthemselves nothing. For my undeserving sake their lives had been a\r\nconstant torment of renunciation--a torment they had not sought to\r\nalleviate by the exchange of a single glance of understanding. There\r\nwere even marvelous moments when, from the depths of my newly informed\r\nheart, I pitied them--poor creatures, who, withheld from the infinite\r\nsolaces that I had come to know, were still utterly within that\r\n\r\n                            Shell of sense\r\n    So frail, so piteously contrived for pain.\r\n\r\nWithin it, yes; yet exercising qualities that so sublimely transcended\r\nit. Yet the shy, hesitating compassion that thus had birth in me was\r\nfar from being able to defeat the earlier, earthlier emotion. The two, I\r\nrecognized, were in a sort of conflict; and I, regarding it, assumed\r\nthat the conflict would never end; that for years, as Allan and Theresa\r\nreckoned time, I should be obliged to withhold myself from the great\r\nspaces and linger suffering, grudging, shamed, where they lingered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt can never have been explained, I suppose, what, to devitalized\r\nperception such as mine, the contact of mortal beings with each other\r\nappears to be. Once to have exercised this sense-freed perception is to\r\nrealize that the gift of prophecy, although the subject of such frequent\r\nmarvel, is no longer mysterious. The merest glance of our sensitive and\r\nuncloyed vision can detect the strength of the relation between two\r\nbeings, and therefore instantly calculate its duration. If you see a\r\nheavy weight suspended from a slender string, you can know, without any\r\nwizardry, that in a few moments the string will snap; well, such, if you\r\nadmit the analogy, is prophecy, is foreknowledge. And it was thus that I\r\nsaw it with Theresa and Allan. For it was perfectly visible to me that\r\nthey would very little longer have the strength to preserve, near each\r\nother, the denuded impersonal relation that they, and that I, behind\r\nthem, insisted on; and that they would have to separate. It was my\r\nsister, perhaps the more sensitive, who first realized this. It had now\r\nbecome possible for me to observe them almost constantly, the effort\r\nnecessary to visit them had so greatly diminished; so that I watched\r\nher, poor, anguished girl, prepare to leave him. I saw each reluctant\r\nmovement that she made. I saw her eyes, worn from self-searching; I\r\nheard her step grown timid from inexplicable fears; I entered her very\r\nheart and heard its pitiful, wild beating. And still I did not\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nFor at this time I had a wonderful, almost demoniacal sense of disposing\r\nof matters to suit my own selfish will. At any moment I could have\r\nchecked their miseries, could have restored happiness and peace. Yet it\r\ngave me, and I could weep to admit it, a monstrous joy to know that\r\nTheresa thought she was leaving Allan of her own free intention, when it\r\nwas I who was contriving, arranging, insisting.... And yet she\r\nwretchedly felt my presence near her; I am certain of that.\r\n\r\nA few days before the time of her intended departure my sister told\r\nAllan that she must speak with him after dinner. Our beautiful old house\r\nbranched out from a circular hall with great arched doors at either end;\r\nand it was through the rear doorway that always in summer, after dinner,\r\nwe passed out into the garden adjoining. As usual, therefore, when the\r\nhour came, Theresa led the way. That dreadful daytime brilliance that in\r\nmy present state I found so hard to endure was now becoming softer. A\r\ndelicate, capricious twilight breeze danced inconsequently through\r\nlanguidly whispering leaves. Lovely pale flowers blossomed like little\r\nmoons in the dusk, and over them the breath of mignonette hung heavily.\r\nIt was a perfect place--and it had so long been ours, Allan's and mine.\r\nIt made me restless and a little wicked that those two should be there\r\ntogether now.\r\n\r\nFor a little they walked about together, speaking of common, daily\r\nthings. Then suddenly Theresa burst out:\r\n\r\n\"I am going away, Allan. I have stayed to do everything that needed to\r\nbe done. Now your mother will be here to care for you, and it is time\r\nfor me to go.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at her and stood still. Theresa had been there so long, she so\r\ndefinitely, to his mind, belonged there. And she was, as I also had\r\njealously known, so lovely there, the small, dark, dainty creature, in\r\nthe old hall, on the wide staircases, in the garden.... Life there\r\nwithout Theresa, even the intentionally remote, the perpetually\r\nrenounced Theresa--he had not dreamed of it, he could not, so suddenly,\r\nconceive of it.\r\n\r\n\"Sit here,\" he said, and drew her down beside him on a bench, \"and tell\r\nme what it means, why you are going. Is it because of something that I\r\nhave been--have done?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. I wondered if she would dare tell him. She looked out and\r\naway from him, and he waited long for her to speak.\r\n\r\nThe pale stars were sliding into their places. The whispering of the\r\nleaves was almost hushed. All about them it was still and shadowy and\r\nsweet. It was that wonderful moment when, for lack of a visible horizon,\r\nthe not yet darkened world seems infinitely greater--a moment when\r\nanything can happen, anything be believed in. To me, watching,\r\nlistening, hovering, there came a dreadful purpose and a dreadful\r\ncourage. Suppose for one moment, Theresa should not only feel, but _see_\r\nme--would she dare to tell him then?\r\n\r\nThere came a brief space of terrible effort, all my fluttering,\r\nuncertain forces strained to the utmost. The instant of my struggle was\r\nendlessly long and the transition seemed to take place outside me--as\r\none sitting in a train, motionless, sees the leagues of earth float by.\r\nAnd then, in a bright, terrible flash I knew I had achieved it--I had\r\n_attained visibility_. Shuddering, insubstantial, but luminously\r\napparent, I stood there before them. And for the instant that I\r\nmaintained the visible state I looked straight into Theresa's soul.\r\n\r\nShe gave a cry. And then, thing of silly, cruel impulses that I was, I\r\nsaw what I had done. The very thing that I wished to avert I had\r\nprecipitated. For Allan, in his sudden terror and pity, had bent and\r\ncaught her in his arms. For the first time they were together; and it\r\nwas I who had brought them.\r\n\r\nThen, to his whispered urging to tell the reason of her cry, Theresa\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Frances was here. You did not see her, standing there, under the\r\nlilacs, with no smile on her face?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, my dear!\" was all that Allan said. I had so long now lived\r\ninvisibly with them, he knew that she was right.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you know what it means?\" she asked him, calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Theresa,\" Allan said, slowly, \"if you and I should go away\r\nsomewhere, could we not evade all this ghostliness? And will you come\r\nwith me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Distance would not banish her,\" my sister confidently asserted. And\r\nthen she said, softly: \"Have you thought what a lonely, awesome thing it\r\nmust be to be so newly dead? Pity her, Allan. We who are warm and alive\r\nshould pity her. She loves you still,--that is the meaning of it all,\r\nyou know--and she wants us to understand that for that reason we must\r\nkeep apart. Oh, it was so plain in her white face as she stood there.\r\nAnd you did not see her?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was your face that I saw,\" Allan solemnly told her--oh, how\r\ndifferent he had grown from the Allan that I had known!--\"and yours is\r\nthe only face that I shall ever see.\" And again he drew her to him.\r\n\r\nShe sprang from him. \"You are defying her, Allan!\" she cried. \"And you\r\nmust not. It is her right to keep us apart, if she wishes. It must be as\r\nshe insists. I shall go, as I told you. And, Allan, I beg of you, leave\r\nme the courage to do as she demands!\"\r\n\r\nThey stood facing each other in the deep dusk, and the wounds that I had\r\ndealt them gaped red and accusing. \"We must pity her,\" Theresa had said.\r\nAnd as I remembered that extraordinary speech, and saw the agony in her\r\nface, and the greater agony in Allan's, there came the great irreparable\r\ncleavage between mortality and me. In a swift, merciful flame the last\r\nof my mortal emotions--gross and tenacious they must have been--was\r\nconsumed. My cold grasp of Allan loosened and a new unearthly love of\r\nhim bloomed in my heart.\r\n\r\nI was now, however, in a difficulty with which my experience in the\r\nnewer state was scarcely sufficient to deal. How could I make it plain\r\nto Allan and Theresa that I wished to bring them together, to heal the\r\nwounds that I had made?\r\n\r\nPityingly, remorsefully, I lingered near them all that night and the\r\nnext day. And by that time had brought myself to the point of a great\r\ndetermination. In the little time that was left, before Theresa should\r\nbe gone and Allan bereft and desolate, I saw the one way that lay open\r\nto me to convince them of my acquiescence in their destiny.\r\n\r\nIn the deepest darkness and silence of the next night I made a greater\r\neffort than it will ever be necessary for me to make again. When they\r\nthink of me, Allan and Theresa, I pray now that they will recall what I\r\ndid that night, and that my thousand frustrations and selfishnesses may\r\nshrivel and be blown from their indulgent memories.\r\n\r\nYet the following morning, as she had planned, Theresa appeared at\r\nbreakfast dressed for her journey. Above in her room there were the\r\nsounds of departure. They spoke little during the brief meal, but when\r\nit was ended Allan said:\r\n\r\n\"Theresa, there is half an hour before you go. Will you come upstairs\r\nwith me? I had a dream that I must tell you of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allan!\" She looked at him, frightened, but went with him. \"It was of\r\nFrances you dreamed,\" she said, quietly, as they entered the library\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"Did I say it was a dream? But I was awake--thoroughly awake. I had not\r\nbeen sleeping well, and I heard, twice, the striking of the clock. And\r\nas I lay there, looking out at the stars, and thinking--thinking of you,\r\nTheresa,--she came to me, stood there before me, in my room. It was no\r\nsheeted specter, you understand; it was Frances, literally she. In some\r\ninexplicable fashion I seemed to be aware that she wanted to make me\r\nknow something, and I waited, watching her face. After a few moments it\r\ncame. She did not speak, precisely. That is, I am sure I heard no sound.\r\nYet the words that came from her were definite enough. She said: 'Don't\r\nlet Theresa leave you. Take her and keep her.' Then she went away. Was\r\nthat a dream?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not meant to tell you,\" Theresa eagerly answered, \"but now I\r\nmust. It is too wonderful. What time did your clock strike, Allan?\"\r\n\r\n\"One, the last time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it was then that I awoke. And she had been with me. I had not seen\r\nher, but her arm had been about me and her kiss was on my cheek. Oh. I\r\nknew; it was unmistakable. And the sound of her voice was with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she bade you, too----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to stay with you. I am glad we told each other.\" She smiled\r\ntearfully and began to fasten her wrap.\r\n\r\n\"But you are not going--_now!_\" Allan cried. \"You know that you cannot,\r\nnow that she has asked you to stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you believe, as I do, that it was she?\" Theresa demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I can never understand, but I know,\" he answered her. \"And now you will\r\nnot go?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am freed. There will be no further semblance of me in my old home, no\r\nsound of my voice, no dimmest echo of my earthly self. They have no\r\nfurther need of me, the two that I have brought together. Theirs is the\r\nfullest joy that the dwellers in the shell of sense can know. Mine is\r\nthe transcendent joy of the unseen spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Woman at Seven Brothers\r\n\r\nBY WILBUR DANIEL STEELE\r\n\r\n     From _Land's End_, by Wilbur Daniel Steele. Copyright, 1908, by\r\n     Harper and Brothers. By permission of the publishers and Wilbur\r\n     Daniel Steele.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tell you sir, I was innocent. I didn't know any more about the world\r\nat twenty-two than some do at twelve. My uncle and aunt in Duxbury\r\nbrought me up strict; I studied hard in high school, I worked hard after\r\nhours, and I went to church twice on Sundays, and I can't see it's right\r\nto put me in a place like this, with crazy people. Oh yes, I know\r\nthey're crazy--you can't tell _me._ As for what they said in court about\r\nfinding her with her husband, that's the Inspector's lie, sir, because\r\nhe's down on me, and wants to make it look like my fault.\r\n\r\nNo, sir, I can't say as I thought she was handsome--not at first. For\r\none thing, her lips were too thin and white, and her color was bad. I'll\r\ntell you a fact, sir; that first day I came off to the Light I was\r\nsitting on my cot in the store-room (that's where the assistant keeper\r\nsleeps at the Seven Brothers), as lonesome as I could be, away from home\r\nfor the first time, and the water all around me, and, even though it\r\nwas a calm day, pounding enough on the ledge to send a kind of a\r\n_woom-woom-woom_ whining up through all that solid rock of the tower.\r\nAnd when old Fedderson poked his head down from the living-room with the\r\nsunshine above making a kind of bright frame around his hair and\r\nwhiskers, to give me a cheery, \"Make yourself to home, son!\" I remember\r\nI said to myself: \"_He's_ all right. I'll get along with _him_. But his\r\nwife's enough to sour milk.\" That was queer, because she was so much\r\nunder him in age--'long about twenty-eight or so, and him nearer fifty.\r\nBut that's what I said, sir.\r\n\r\nOf course that feeling wore off, same as any feeling will wear off\r\nsooner or later in a place like the Seven Brothers. Cooped up in a place\r\nlike that you come to know folks so well that you forget what they _do_\r\nlook like. There was a long time I never noticed her, any more than\r\nyou'd notice the cat. We used to sit of an evening around the table, as\r\nif you were Fedderson there, and me here, and her somewhere back there,\r\nin the rocker, knitting. Fedderson would be working on his\r\nJacob's-ladder, and I'd be reading. He'd been working on that\r\nJacob's-ladder a year, I guess, and every time the Inspector came off\r\nwith the tender he was so astonished to see how good that ladder was\r\nthat the old man would go to work and make it better. That's all he\r\nlived for.\r\n\r\nIf I was reading, as I say, I daren't take my eyes off the book, or\r\nFedderson had me. And then he'd begin--what the Inspector said about\r\nhim. How surprised the member of the board had been, that time, to see\r\neverything so clean about the light. What the Inspector had said about\r\nFedderson's being stuck here in a second-class light--best keeper on the\r\ncoast. And so on and so on, till either he or I had to go aloft and have\r\na look at the wicks.\r\n\r\nHe'd been there twenty-three years, all told, and he'd got used to the\r\nfeeling that he was kept down unfair--so used to it, I guess, that he\r\nfed on it, and told himself how folks ashore would talk when he was dead\r\nand gone--best keeper on the coast--kept down unfair. Not that he said\r\nthat to me. No, he was far too loyal and humble and respectful, doing\r\nhis duty without complaint, as anybody could see.\r\n\r\nAnd all that time, night after night, hardly ever a word out of the\r\nwoman. As I remember it, she seemed more like a piece of furniture than\r\nanything else--not even a very good cook, nor over and above tidy. One\r\nday, when he and I were trimming the lamp, he passed the remark that his\r\n_first_ wife used to dust the lens and take a pride in it. Not that he\r\nsaid a word against Anna, though. He never said a word against any\r\nliving mortal; he was too upright.\r\n\r\nI don't know how it came about; or, rather, I _do_ know, but it was so\r\nsudden, and so far away from my thoughts, that it shocked me, like the\r\nworld turned over. It was at prayers. That night I remember Fedderson\r\nwas uncommon long-winded. We'd had a batch of newspapers out by the\r\ntender, and at such times the old man always made a long watch of it,\r\ngetting the world straightened out. For one thing, the United States\r\nminister to Turkey was dead. Well, from him and his soul, Fedderson got\r\non to Turkey and the Presbyterian college there, and from that to\r\nheathen in general. He rambled on and on, like the surf on the ledge,\r\n_woom-woom-woom_, never coming to an end.\r\n\r\nYou know how you'll be at prayers sometimes. My mind strayed. I counted\r\nthe canes in the chair-seat where I was kneeling; I plaited a corner of\r\nthe table-cloth between my fingers for a spell, and by and by my eyes\r\nwent wandering up the back of the chair.\r\n\r\nThe woman, sir, was looking at me. Her chair was back to mine, close,\r\nand both our heads were down in the shadow under the edge of the table,\r\nwith Fedderson clear over on the other side by the stove. And there were\r\nher two eyes hunting mine between the spindles in the shadow. You won't\r\nbelieve me, sir, but I tell you I felt like jumping to my feet and\r\nrunning out of the room--it was so queer.\r\n\r\nI don't know what her husband was praying about after that. His voice\r\ndidn't mean anything, no more than the seas on the ledge away down\r\nthere. I went to work to count the canes in the seat again, but all my\r\neyes were in the top of my head. It got so I couldn't stand it. We were\r\nat the Lord's prayer, saying it singsong together, when I had to look up\r\nagain. And there her two eyes were, between the spindles, hunting mine.\r\nJust then all of us were saying, \"Forgive us our trespasses--\" I thought\r\nof it afterward.\r\n\r\nWhen we got up she was turned the other way, but I couldn't help seeing\r\nher cheeks were red. It was terrible. I wondered if Fedderson would\r\nnotice, though I might have known he wouldn't--not him. He was in too\r\nmuch of a hurry to get at his Jacob's-ladder, and then he had to tell me\r\nfor the tenth time what the Inspector'd said that day about getting him\r\nanother light--Kingdom Come, maybe, he said.\r\n\r\nI made some excuse or other and got away. Once in the store-room, I sat\r\ndown on my cot and stayed there a long time, feeling queerer than\r\nanything. I read a chapter in the Bible, I don't know why. After I'd got\r\nmy boots off I sat with them in my hands for as much as an hour, I\r\nguess, staring at the oil-tank and its lopsided shadow on the wall. I\r\ntell you, sir, I was shocked. I was only twenty-two remember, and I was\r\nshocked and horrified.\r\n\r\nAnd when I did turn in, finally, I didn't sleep at all well. Two or\r\nthree times I came to, sitting straight up in bed. Once I got up and\r\nopened the outer door to have a look. The water was like glass, dim,\r\nwithout a breath of wind, and the moon just going down. Over on the\r\nblack shore I made out two lights in a village, like a pair of eyes\r\nwatching. Lonely? My, yes! Lonely and nervous. I had a horror of her,\r\nsir. The dinghy-boat hung on its davits just there in front of the door,\r\nand for a minute I had an awful hankering to climb into it, lower away,\r\nand row off, no matter where. It sounds foolish.\r\n\r\nWell, it seemed foolish next morning, with the sun shining and\r\neverything as usual--Fedderson sucking his pen and wagging his head over\r\nhis eternal \"log,\" and his wife down in the rocker with her head in the\r\nnewspaper, and her breakfast work still waiting. I guess that jarred it\r\nout of me more than anything else--sight of her slouched down there,\r\nwith her stringy, yellow hair and her dusty apron and the pale back of\r\nher neck, reading the Society Notes. _Society Notes_! Think of it! For\r\nthe first time since I came to Seven Brothers I wanted to laugh.\r\n\r\nI guess I did laugh when I went aloft to clean the lamp and found\r\neverything so free and breezy, gulls flying high and little whitecaps\r\nmaking under a westerly. It was like feeling a big load dropped off your\r\nshoulders. Fedderson came up with his dust-rag and cocked his head at\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Ray?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said I. And then I couldn't help it. \"Seems kind of out of\r\nplace for society notes,\" said I, \"out here at Seven Brothers.\"\r\n\r\nHe was the other side of the lens, and when he looked at me he had a\r\nthousand eyes, all sober. For a minute I thought he was going on\r\ndusting, but then he came out and sat down on a sill.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" said he, \"I get to thinking it may be a mite dull for her\r\nout here. She's pretty young, Ray. Not much more'n a girl, hardly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much more'n a _girl!_\" It gave me a turn, sir, as though I'd seen\r\nmy aunt in short dresses.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good home for her, though,\" he went on slow. \"I've seen a lot\r\nworse ashore, Ray. Of course if I could get a shore light----\"\r\n\r\n\"Kingdom Come's a shore light.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me out of his deep-set eyes, and then he turned them around\r\nthe light-room, where he'd been so long.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he, wagging his head. \"It ain't for such as me.\"\r\n\r\nI never saw so humble a man.\r\n\r\n\"But look here,\" he went on, more cheerful. \"As I was telling her just\r\nnow, a month from yesterday's our fourth anniversary, and I'm going to\r\ntake her ashore for the day and give her a holiday--new hat and\r\neverything. A girl wants a mite of excitement now and then, Ray.\"\r\n\r\nThere it was again, that \"girl.\" It gave me the fidgets, sir. I had to\r\ndo something about it. It's close quarters for last names in a light,\r\nand I'd taken to calling him Uncle Matt soon after I came. Now, when I\r\nwas at table that noon I spoke over to where she was standing by the\r\nstove, getting him another help of chowder.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I'll have some, too, _Aunt_ Anna,\" said I, matter of fact.\r\n\r\nShe never said a word nor gave a sign--just stood there kind of\r\nround-shouldered, dipping the chowder. And that night at prayers I\r\nhitched my chair around the table, with its back the other way.\r\n\r\nYou get awful lazy in a lighthouse, some ways. No matter how much\r\ntinkering you've got, there's still a lot of time and there's such\r\na thing as too much reading. The changes in weather get monotonous,\r\ntoo, by and by; the light burns the same on a thick night as it\r\ndoes on a fair one. Of course there's the ships, north-bound,\r\nsouth-bound--wind-jammers, freighters, passenger-boats full of\r\npeople. In the watches at night you can see their lights go by, and\r\nwonder what they are, how they're laden, where they'll fetch up,\r\nand all. I used to do that almost every evening when it was my first\r\nwatch, sitting out on the walk-around up there with my legs hanging\r\nover the edge and my chin propped on the railing--lazy. The Boston\r\nboat was the prettiest to see, with her three tiers of port-holes\r\nlit, like a string of pearls wrapped round and round a woman's\r\nneck--well away, too, for the ledge must have made a couple of\r\nhundred fathoms off the Light, like a white dog-tooth of a breaker,\r\neven on the darkest night.\r\n\r\nWell, I was lolling there one night, as I say, watching the Boston boat\r\ngo by, not thinking of anything special, when I heard the door on the\r\nother side of the tower open and footsteps coming around to me.\r\n\r\nBy and by I nodded toward the boat and passed the remark that she was\r\nfetching in uncommon close to-night. No answer. I made nothing of that,\r\nfor oftentimes Fedderson wouldn't answer, and after I'd watched the\r\nlights crawling on through the dark a spell, just to make conversation I\r\nsaid I guessed there'd be a bit of weather before long.\r\n\r\n\"I've noticed,\" said I, \"when there's weather coming on, and the wind in\r\nthe northeast, you can hear the orchestra playing aboard of her just\r\nover there. I make it out now. Do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Oh--yes--! _I hear it all right!_\"\r\n\r\nYou can imagine I started. It wasn't him, but _her_.\r\nAnd there was something in the way she said that speech,\r\nsir--something--well--unnatural. Like a hungry animal snapping\r\nat a person's hand.\r\n\r\nI turned and looked at her sidewise. She was standing by the railing,\r\nleaning a little outward, the top of her from the waist picked out\r\nbright by the lens behind her. I didn't know what in the world to say,\r\nand yet I had a feeling I ought not to sit there mum.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said I, \"what that captain's thinking of, fetching in so\r\nhandy to-night. It's no way. I tell you, if 'twasn't for this light,\r\nshe'd go to work and pile up on the ledge some thick night----\"\r\n\r\nShe turned at that and stared straight into the lens. I didn't like the\r\nlook of her face. Somehow, with its edges cut hard all around and its\r\ntwo eyes closed down to slits, like a cat's, it made a kind of mask.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" I went on, uneasy enough--\"and then where'd all their music\r\nbe of a sudden, and their goings-on and their singing----\"\r\n\r\n\"And dancing!\" She clipped me off so quick it took my breath.\r\n\r\n\"D-d-dancing?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"That's dance-music,\" said she. She was looking at the boat again.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" I felt I had to keep on talking.\r\n\r\nWell, sir--she laughed. I looked at her. She had on a shawl of some\r\nstuff or other that shined in the light; she had it pulled tight around\r\nher with her two hands in front at her breast, and I saw her shoulders\r\nswaying in tune.\r\n\r\n\"How do I _know_?\" she cried. Then she laughed again, the same kind of a\r\nlaugh. It was queer, sir, to see her, and to hear her. She turned, as\r\nquick as that, and leaned toward me. \"Don't you know how to dance, Ray?\"\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\n\"N-no,\" I managed, and I was going to say \"_Aunt Anna_,\" but the thing\r\nchoked in my throat.\r\n\r\nI tell you she was looking square at me all the time with her two eyes\r\nand moving with the music as if she didn't know it. By heavens, sir, it\r\ncame over me of a sudden that she wasn't so bad-looking, after all. I\r\nguess I must have sounded like a fool.\r\n\r\n\"You--you see,\" said I, \"she's cleared the rip there now, and the\r\nmusic's gone. You--you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said she, turning back slow. \"That's where it stops every\r\nnight--night after night--it stops just there--at the rip.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she spoke again her voice was different. I never heard the like of\r\nit, thin and taut as a thread. It made me shiver, sir.\r\n\r\n\"I hate 'em!\" That's what she said. \"I hate 'em all. I'd like to see 'em\r\ndead. I'd love to see 'em torn apart on the rocks, night after night. I\r\ncould bathe my hands in their blood, night after night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd do you know, sir, I saw it with my own eyes, her hands moving in\r\neach other above the rail. But it was her voice, though. I didn't know\r\nwhat to do, or what to say, so I poked my head through the railing and\r\nlooked down at the water. I don't think I'm a coward, sir, but it was\r\nlike a cold--ice-cold--hand, taking hold of my beating heart.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked up finally, she was gone. By and by I went in and had a\r\nlook at the lamp, hardly knowing what I was about. Then, seeing by my\r\nwatch it was time for the old man to come on duty, I started to go\r\nbelow. In the Seven Brothers, you understand, the stair goes down in a\r\nspiral through a well against the south wall and first there's the door\r\nto the keeper's room and then you come to another, and that's the\r\nliving-room, and then down to the store-room. And at night, if you don't\r\ncarry a lantern, it's as black as the pit.\r\n\r\nWell, down I went, sliding my hand along the rail, and as usual I\r\nstopped to give a rap on the keeper's door, in case he was taking a nap\r\nafter supper. Sometimes he did.\r\n\r\nI stood there, blind as a bat, with my mind still up on the walk-around.\r\nThere was no answer to my knock. I hadn't expected any. Just from habit,\r\nand with my right foot already hanging down for the next step, I reached\r\nout to give the door one more tap for luck.\r\n\r\nDo you know, sir, my hand didn't fetch up on anything. The door had been\r\nthere a second before, and now the door wasn't there. My hand just went\r\non going through the dark, on and on, and I didn't seem to have sense or\r\npower enough to stop it. There didn't seem any air in the well to\r\nbreathe, and my ears were drumming to the surf--that's how scared I was.\r\nAnd then my hand touched the flesh of a face, and something in the dark\r\nsaid, \"Oh!\" no louder than a sigh.\r\n\r\nNext thing I knew, sir, I was down in the living-room, warm and\r\nyellow-lit, with Fedderson cocking his head at me across the table,\r\nwhere he was at that eternal Jacob's-ladder of his.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Ray?\" said he. \"Lord's sake, Ray!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said I. Then I think I told him I was sick. That night I\r\nwrote a letter to A.L. Peters, the grain-dealer in Duxbury, asking for a\r\njob--even though it wouldn't go ashore for a couple of weeks, just the\r\nwriting of it made me feel better.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell you how those two weeks went by. I don't know why, but\r\nI felt like hiding in a corner all the time. I had to come to meals, but\r\nI didn't look at her, though, not once, unless it was by accident.\r\nFedderson thought I was still ailing and nagged me to death with advice\r\nand so on. One thing I took care not to do, I can tell you, and that was\r\nto knock on his door till I'd made certain he wasn't below in the\r\nliving-room--though I was tempted to.\r\n\r\nYes, sir; that's a queer thing, and I wouldn't tell you if I hadn't set\r\nout to give you the truth. Night after night, stopping there on the\r\nlanding in that black pit, the air gone out of my lungs and the surf\r\ndrumming in my ears and sweat standing cold on my neck--and one hand\r\nlifting up in the air--God forgive me, sir! Maybe I did wrong not to\r\nlook at her more, drooping about her work in her gingham apron, with her\r\nhair stringing.\r\n\r\nWhen the Inspector came off with the tender, that time, I told him I\r\nwas through. That's when he took the dislike to me, I guess, for he\r\nlooked at me kind of sneering and said, soft as I was, I'd have to put\r\nup with it till next relief. And then, said he, there'd be a whole\r\nhouse-cleaning at Seven Brothers, because he'd gotten Fedderson the\r\nberth at Kingdom Come. And with that he slapped the old man on the back.\r\n\r\nI wish you could have seen Fedderson, sir. He sat down on my cot as if\r\nhis knees had given 'way. Happy? You'd think he'd be happy, with all his\r\ndreams come true. Yes, he was happy, beaming all over--for a minute.\r\nThen, sir, he began to shrivel up. It was like seeing a man cut down in\r\nhis prime before your eyes. He began to wag his head.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he. \"No, no; it's not for such as me. I'm good enough for\r\nSeven Brothers, and that's all, Mr. Bayliss. That's all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for all the Inspector could say, that's what he stuck to. He'd\r\nfigured himself a martyr so many years, nursed that injustice like a\r\nmother with her first-born, sir; and now in his old age, so to speak,\r\nthey weren't to rob him of it. Fedderson was going to wear out his life\r\nin a second-class light, and folks would talk--that was his idea. I\r\nheard him hailing down as the tender was casting off:\r\n\r\n\"See you to-morrow, Mr. Bayliss. Yep. Coming ashore with the wife for a\r\nspree. Anniversary. Yep.\"\r\n\r\nBut he didn't sound much like a spree. They _had_, robbed him, partly,\r\nafter all. I wondered what _she_ thought about it. I didn't know till\r\nnight. She didn't show up to supper, which Fedderson and I got\r\nourselves--had a headache, be said. It was my early watch. I went and\r\nlit up and came back to read a spell. He was finishing off the\r\nJacob's-ladder, and thoughtful, like a man that's lost a treasure. Once\r\nor twice I caught him looking about the room on the sly. It was\r\npathetic, sir.\r\n\r\nGoing up the second time, I stepped out on the walk-around to have a\r\nlook at things. She was there on the seaward side, wrapped in that silky\r\nthing. A fair sea was running across the ledge and it was coming on a\r\nlittle thick--not too thick. Off to the right the Boston boat was\r\nblowing, _whroom-whroom!_ Creeping up on us, quarter-speed. There was\r\nanother fellow behind her, and a fisherman's conch farther offshore.\r\n\r\nI don't know why, but I stopped beside her and leaned on the rail. She\r\ndidn't appear to notice me, one way or another. We stood and we stood,\r\nlistening to the whistles, and the longer we stood the more it got on my\r\nnerves, her not noticing me. I suppose she'd been too much on my mind\r\nlately. I began to be put out. I scraped my feet. I coughed. By and by I\r\nsaid out loud:\r\n\r\n\"Look here, I guess I better get out the fog-horn and give those fellows\r\na toot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said she, without moving her head--calm as that.\r\n\r\n\"_Why?_\" It gave me a turn, sir. For a minute I stared at her. \"Why?\r\nBecause if she don't pick up this light before very many minutes she'll\r\nbe too close in to wear--tide'll have her on the rocks--that's why!\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't see her face, but I could see one of her silk shoulders lift\r\na little, like a shrug. And there I kept on staring at her, a dumb one,\r\nsure enough. I know what brought me to was hearing the Boston boat's\r\nthree sharp toots as she picked up the light--mad as anything--and swung\r\nher helm a-port. I turned away from her, sweat stringing down my face,\r\nand walked around to the door. It was just as well, too, for the\r\nfeed-pipe was plugged in the lamp and the wicks were popping. She'd have\r\nbeen out in another five minutes, sir.\r\n\r\nWhen I'd finished, I saw that woman standing in the doorway. Her eyes\r\nwere bright. I had a horror of her, sir, a living horror.\r\n\r\n\"If only the light had been out,\" said she, low and sweet.\r\n\r\n\"God forgive you,\" said I. \"You don't know what you're saying.\"\r\n\r\nShe went down the stair into the well, winding out of sight, and as long\r\nas I could see her, her eyes were watching mine. When I went, myself,\r\nafter a few minutes, she was waiting for me on that first landing,\r\nstanding still in the dark. She took hold of my hand, though I tried to\r\nget it away.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" said she in my ear.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by?\" said I. I didn't understand.\r\n\r\n\"You heard what he said to-day--about Kingdom Come? Be it so--on his own\r\nhead. I'll never come back here. Once I set foot ashore--I've got\r\nfriends in Brightonboro, Ray.\"\r\n\r\nI got away from her and started on down. But I stopped. \"Brightonboro?\"\r\nI whispered back. \"Why do you tell _me_?\" My throat was raw to the\r\nwords, like a sore.\r\n\r\n\"So you'd know,\" said she.\r\n\r\nWell, sir, I saw them off next morning, down that new Jacob's-ladder\r\ninto the dinghy-boat, her in a dress of blue velvet and him in his best\r\ncutaway and derby--rowing away, smaller and smaller, the two of them.\r\nAnd then I went back and sat on my cot, leaving the door open and the\r\nladder still hanging down the wall, along with the boat-falls.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether it was relief, or what. I suppose I must have been\r\nworked up even more than I'd thought those past weeks, for now it was\r\nall over I was like a rag. I got down on my knees, sir, and prayed to\r\nGod for the salvation of my soul, and when I got up and climbed to the\r\nliving-room it was half past twelve by the clock. There was rain on the\r\nwindows and the sea was running blue-black under the sun. I'd sat there\r\nall that time not knowing there was a squall.\r\n\r\nIt was funny; the glass stood high, but those black squalls kept coming\r\nand going all afternoon, while I was at work up in the light-room. And I\r\nworked hard, to keep myself busy. First thing I knew it was five, and no\r\nsign of the boat yet. It began to get dim and kind of purplish-gray over\r\nthe land. The sun was down. I lit up, made everything snug, and got out\r\nthe night-glasses to have another look for that boat. He'd said he\r\nintended to get back before five. No sign. And then, standing there, it\r\ncame over me that of course he wouldn't be coming off--he'd be hunting\r\n_her_, poor old fool. It looked like I had to stand two men's watches\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nNever mind. I felt like myself again, even if I hadn't had any dinner or\r\nsupper. Pride came to me that night on the walk-around, watching the\r\nboats go by--little boats, big boats, the Boston boat with all her\r\npearls and her dance-music. They couldn't see me; they didn't know who I\r\nwas; but to the last of them, they depended on _me_. They say a man must\r\nbe born again. Well, I was born again. I breathed deep in the wind.\r\n\r\nDawn broke hard and red as a dying coal. I put out the light and started\r\nto go below. Born again; yes, sir. I felt so good I whistled in the\r\nwell, and when I came to the first door on the stair I reached out in\r\nthe dark to give it a rap for luck. And then, sir, the hair prickled all\r\nover my scalp, when I found my hand just going on and on through the\r\nair, the same as it had gone once before, and all of a sudden I wanted\r\nto yell, because I thought I was going to touch flesh. It's funny what\r\ntheir just forgetting to close their door did to me, isn't it?\r\n\r\nWell, I reached for the latch and pulled it to with a bang and ran down\r\nas if a ghost was after me. I got up some coffee and bread and bacon for\r\nbreakfast. I drank the coffee. But somehow I couldn't eat, all along of\r\nthat open door. The light in the room was blood. I got to thinking. I\r\nthought how she'd talked about those men, women, and children on the\r\nrocks, and how she'd made to bathe her hands over the rail. I almost\r\njumped out of my chair then; it seemed for a wink she was there beside\r\nthe stove watching me with that queer half-smile--really, I seemed to\r\nsee her for a flash across the red table-cloth in the red light of dawn.\r\n\r\n\"Look here!\" said I to myself, sharp enough; and then I gave myself a\r\ngood laugh and went below. There I took a look out of the door, which\r\nwas still open, with the ladder hanging down. I made sure to see the\r\npoor old fool come pulling around the point before very long now.\r\n\r\nMy boots were hurting a little, and, taking them off, I lay down on the\r\ncot to rest, and somehow I went to sleep. I had horrible dreams. I saw\r\nher again standing in that blood-red kitchen, and she seemed to be\r\nwashing her hands, and the surf on the ledge was whining up the tower,\r\nlouder and louder all the time, and what it whined was, \"Night after\r\nnight--night after night.\" What woke me was cold water in my face.\r\n\r\nThe store-room was in gloom. That scared me at first; I thought night\r\nhad come, and remembered the light. But then I saw the gloom was of a\r\nstorm. The floor was shining wet, and the water in my face was spray,\r\nflung up through the open door. When I ran to close it, it almost made\r\nme dizzy to see the gray-and-white breakers marching past. The land was\r\ngone; the sky shut down heavy overhead; there was a piece of wreckage on\r\nthe back of a swell, and the Jacob's-ladder was carried clean away. How\r\nthat sea had picked up so quick I can't think. I looked at my watch and\r\nit wasn't four in the afternoon yet.\r\n\r\nWhen I closed the door, sir, it was almost dark in the store-room. I'd\r\nnever been in the Light before in a gale of wind. I wondered why I was\r\nshivering so, till I found it was the floor below me shivering, and the\r\nwalls and stair. Horrible crunchings and grindings ran away up the\r\ntower, and now and then there was a great thud somewhere, like a\r\ncannon-shot in a cave. I tell you, sir, I was alone, and I was in a\r\nmortal fright for a minute or so. And yet I had to get myself together.\r\nThere was the light up there not tended to, and an early dark coming on\r\nand a heavy night and all, and I had to go. And I had to pass that door.\r\n\r\nYou'll say it's foolish, sir, and maybe it _was_ foolish. Maybe it was\r\nbecause I hadn't eaten. But I began thinking of that door up there the\r\nminute I set foot on the stair, and all the way up through that howling\r\ndark well I dreaded to pass it. I told myself I wouldn't stop. I didn't\r\nstop. I felt the landing underfoot and I went on, four steps, five--and\r\nthen I couldn't. I turned and went back. I put out my hand and it went\r\non into nothing. That door, sir, was open again.\r\n\r\nI left it be; I went on up to the light-room and set to work. It was\r\nBedlam there, sir, screeching Bedlam, but I took no notice. I kept my\r\neyes down. I trimmed those seven wicks, sir, as neat as ever they were\r\ntrimmed; I polished the brass till it shone, and I dusted the lens. It\r\nwasn't till that was done that I let myself look back to see who it was\r\nstanding there, half out of sight in the well. It was her, sir.\r\n\r\n\"Where'd you come from?\" I asked. I remember my voice was sharp.\r\n\r\n\"Up Jacob's-ladder,\" said she, and hers was like the syrup of flowers.\r\n\r\nI shook my head. I was savage, sir. \"The ladder's carried away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cast it off,\" said she, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said I, \"you must have come while I was asleep.\" Another thought\r\ncame on me heavy as a ton of lead. \"And where's _he_?\" said I. \"Where's\r\nthe boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's drowned,\" said she, as easy as that. \"And I let the boat go\r\nadrift. You wouldn't hear me when I called.\"\r\n\r\n\"But look here,\" said I. \"If you came through the store-room, why didn't\r\nyou wake me up? Tell me that!\" It sounds foolish enough, me standing\r\nlike a lawyer in court, trying to prove she _couldn't_ be there.\r\n\r\nShe didn't answer for a moment. I guess she sighed, though I couldn't\r\nhear for the gale, and her eyes grew soft, sir, so soft.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't,\" said she. \"You looked so peaceful--dear one.\"\r\n\r\nMy cheeks and neck went hot, sir, as if a warm iron was laid on them. I\r\ndidn't know what to say. I began to stammer, \"What do you mean--\" but\r\nshe was going back down the stair, out of sight. My God sir, and I used\r\nnot to think she was good-looking!\r\n\r\nI started to follow her. I wanted to know what she meant. Then I said to\r\nmyself, \"If I don't go--if I wait here--she'll come back.\" And I went to\r\nthe weather side and stood looking out of the window. Not that there was\r\nmuch to see. It was growing dark, and the Seven Brothers looked like the\r\nmane of a running horse, a great, vast, white horse running into the\r\nwind. The air was a-welter with it. I caught one peep of a fisherman,\r\nlying down flat trying to weather the ledge, and I said, \"God help them\r\nall to-night,\" and then I went hot at sound of that \"God.\"\r\n\r\nI was right about her, though. She was back again. I wanted her to speak\r\nfirst, before I turned, but she wouldn't. I didn't hear her go out; I\r\ndidn't know what she was up to till I saw her coming outside on the\r\nwalk-around, drenched wet already. I pounded on the glass for her to\r\ncome in and not be a fool; if she heard she gave no sign of it.\r\n\r\nThere she stood, and there I stood watching her. Lord, sir--was it just\r\nthat I'd never had eyes to see? Or are there women who bloom? Her\r\nclothes were shining on her, like a carving, and her hair was let down\r\nlike a golden curtain tossing and streaming in the gale, and there she\r\nstood with her lips half open, drinking, and her eyes half closed,\r\ngazing straight away over the Seven Brothers, and her shoulders swaying,\r\nas if in tune with the wind and water and all the ruin. And when I\r\nlooked at her hands over the rail, sir, they were moving in each other\r\nas if they bathed, and then I remembered, sir.\r\n\r\nA cold horror took me. I knew now why she had come back again. She\r\nwasn't a woman--she was a devil. I turned my back on her. I said to\r\nmyself: \"It's time to light up. You've got to light up\"--like that, over\r\nand over, out loud. My hand was shivering so I could hardly find a\r\nmatch; and when I scratched it, it only flared a second and then went\r\nout in the back draught from the open door. She was standing in the\r\ndoorway, looking at me. It's queer, sir, but I felt like a child caught\r\nin mischief.\r\n\r\n\"I--I--was going to light up,\" I managed to say, finally.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said she. No, I can't say it as she did.\r\n\r\n\"_Why?_\" said I. \"_My God!_\"\r\n\r\nShe came nearer, laughing, as if with pity, low, you know. \"Your God?\r\nAnd who is your God? What is God? What is anything on a night like\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\nI drew back from her. All I could say anything about was the light.\r\n\r\n\"Why not the dark?\" said she. \"Dark is softer than\r\nlight--tenderer--dearer than light. From the dark up here, away up here\r\nin the wind and storm, we can watch the ships go by, you and I. And you\r\nlove me so. You've loved me so long, Ray.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never have!\" I struck out at her. \"I don't! I don't!\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was lower than ever, but there was the same laughing pity in\r\nit. \"Oh yes, you have.\" And she was near me again.\r\n\r\n\"I have?\" I yelled. \"I'll show you! I'll show you if I have!\"\r\n\r\nI got another match, sir, and scratched it on the brass. I gave it to\r\nthe first wick, the little wick that's inside all the others. It bloomed\r\nlike a yellow flower. \"I _have_?\" I yelled, and gave it to the next.\r\n\r\nThen there was a shadow, and I saw she was leaning beside me, her two\r\nelbows on the brass, her two arms stretched out above the wicks, her\r\nbare forearms and wrists and hands. I gave a gasp:\r\n\r\n\"Take care! You'll burn them! For God's sake----\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't move or speak. The match burned my fingers and went out, and\r\nall I could do was stare at those arms of hers, helpless. I'd never\r\nnoticed her arms before. They were rounded and graceful and covered with\r\na soft down, like a breath of gold. Then I heard her speaking close to\r\nmy ear.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty arms,\" she said. \"Pretty arms!\"\r\n\r\nI turned. Her eyes were fixed on mine. They seemed heavy, as if with\r\nsleep, and yet between their lids they were two wells, deep and deep,\r\nand as if they held all the things I'd ever thought or dreamed in them.\r\nI looked away from them, at her lips. Her lips were red as poppies,\r\nheavy with redness. They moved, and I heard them speaking:\r\n\r\n\"Poor boy, you love me so, and you want to kiss me--don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I. But I couldn't turn around. I looked at her hair. I'd\r\nalways thought it was stringy hair. Some hair curls naturally with damp,\r\nthey say, and perhaps that was it, for there were pearls of wet on it,\r\nand it was thick and shimmering around her face, making soft shadows by\r\nthe temples. There was green in it, queer strands of green like braids.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but weed,\" said she, with that slow, sleepy smile.\r\n\r\nSomehow or other I felt calmer than I had any time. \"Look here,\" said I.\r\n\"I'm going to light this lamp.\" I took out a match, scratched it, and\r\ntouched the third wick. The flame ran around, bigger than the other two\r\ntogether. But still her arms hung there. I bit my lip. \"By God, I will!\"\r\nsaid I to myself, and I lit the fourth.\r\n\r\nIt was fierce, sir, fierce! And yet those arms never trembled. I had to\r\nlook around at her. Her eyes were still looking into mine, so deep and\r\ndeep, and her red lips were still smiling with that queer, sleepy droop;\r\nthe only thing was that tears were raining down her cheeks--big, glowing\r\nround, jewel tears. It wasn't human, sir. It was like a dream.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty arms,\" she sighed, and then, as if those words had broken\r\nsomething in her heart, there came a great sob bursting from her lips.\r\nTo hear it drove me mad. I reached to drag her away, but she was too\r\nquick, sir; she cringed from me and slipped out from between my hands.\r\nIt was like she faded away, sir, and went down in a bundle, nursing her\r\npoor arms and mourning over them with those terrible, broken sobs.\r\n\r\nThe sound of them took the manhood out of me--you'd have been the same,\r\nsir. I knelt down beside her on the floor and covered my face.\r\n\r\n\"Please!\" I moaned. \"Please! Please!\" That's all I could say. I wanted\r\nher to forgive me. I reached out a hand, blind, for forgiveness, and I\r\ncouldn't find her anywhere. I had hurt her so, and she was afraid of\r\nme, of _me_, sir, who loved her so deep it drove me crazy.\r\n\r\nI could see her down the stair, though it was dim and my eyes were\r\nfilled with tears. I stumbled after her, crying, \"Please! Please!\" The\r\nlittle wicks I'd lit were blowing in the wind from the door and smoking\r\nthe glass beside them black. One went out. I pleaded with them, the same\r\nas I would plead with a human being. I said I'd be back in a second. I\r\npromised. And I went on down the stair, crying like a baby because I'd\r\nhurt her, and she was afraid of me--of _me_, sir.\r\n\r\nShe had gone into her room. The door was closed against me and I could\r\nhear her sobbing beyond it, broken-hearted. My heart was broken too. I\r\nbeat on the door with my palms. I begged her to forgive me. I told her I\r\nloved her. And all the answer was that sobbing in the dark.\r\n\r\nAnd then I lifted the latch and went in, groping, pleading.\r\n\"Dearest--please! Because I love you!\"\r\n\r\nI heard her speak down near the floor. There wasn't any anger in her\r\nvoice; nothing but sadness and despair.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she. \"You don't love me, Ray. You never have.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do! I have!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said she, as if she was tired out.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you?\" I was groping for her. I thought, and lit a match. She\r\nhad got to the door and was standing there as if ready to fly. I went\r\ntoward her, and she made me stop. She took my breath away. \"I hurt your\r\narms,\" said I, in a dream.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, hardly moving her lips. She held them out to the match's\r\nlight for me to look and there was never a scar on them--not even that\r\nsoft, golden down was singed, sir. \"You can't hurt my body,\" said she,\r\nsad as anything. \"Only my heart, Ray; my poor heart.\"\r\n\r\nI tell you again, she took my breath away. I lit another match. \"How can\r\nyou be so beautiful?\" I wondered.\r\n\r\nShe answered in riddles--but oh, the sadness of her, sir.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said she, \"I've always so wanted to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"How come your eyes so heavy?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Because I've seen so many things I never dreamed of,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"How come your hair so thick?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the seaweed makes it thick,\" said she smiling queer, queer.\r\n\r\n\"How come seaweed there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of the bottom of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nShe talked in riddles, but it was like poetry to hear her, or a song.\r\n\r\n\"How come your lips so red?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Because they've wanted so long to be kissed.\"\r\n\r\nFire was on me, sir. I reached out to catch her, but she was gone, out\r\nof the door and down the stair. I followed, stumbling. I must have\r\ntripped on the turn, for I remember going through the air and fetching\r\nup with a crash, and I didn't know anything for a spell--how long I\r\ncan't say. When I came to, she was there, somewhere, bending over me,\r\ncrooning, \"My love--my love--\" under her breath like, a song.\r\n\r\nBut then when I got up, she was not where my arms went; she was down the\r\nstair again, just ahead of me. I followed her. I was tottering and dizzy\r\nand full of pain. I tried to catch up with her in the dark of the\r\nstore-room, but she was too quick for me, sir, always a little too quick\r\nfor me. Oh, she was cruel to me, sir. I kept bumping against things,\r\nhurting myself still worse, and it was cold and wet and a horrible noise\r\nall the while, sir; and then, sir, I found the door was open, and a sea\r\nhad parted the hinges.\r\n\r\nI don't know how it all went, sir. I'd tell you if I could, but it's all\r\nso blurred--sometimes it seems more like a dream. I couldn't find her\r\nany more; I couldn't hear her; I went all over, everywhere. Once, I\r\nremember, I found myself hanging out of that door between the davits,\r\nlooking down into those big black seas and crying like a baby. It's all\r\nriddles and blur. I can't seem to tell you much, sir. It was all--all--I\r\ndon't know.\r\n\r\nI was talking to somebody else--not her. It was the Inspector. I hardly\r\nknew it was the Inspector. His face was as gray as a blanket, and his\r\neyes were bloodshot, and his lips were twisted. His left wrist hung\r\ndown, awkward. It was broken coming aboard the Light in that sea. Yes,\r\nwe were in the living-room. Yes, sir, it was daylight--gray daylight. I\r\ntell you, sir, the man looked crazy to me. He was waving his good arm\r\ntoward the weather windows, and what he was saying, over and over, was\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n\"_Look what you done, damn you! Look what you done_!\"\r\n\r\nAnd what I was saying was this:\r\n\r\n\"_I've lost her_!\"\r\n\r\nI didn't pay any attention to him, nor him to me. By and by he did,\r\nthough. He stopped his talking all of a sudden, and his eyes looked like\r\nthe devil's eyes. He put them up close to mine. He grabbed my arm with\r\nhis good hand, and I cried, I was so weak.\r\n\r\n\"Johnson,\" said he, \"is that it? By the living God--if you got a woman\r\nout here, Johnson!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I. \"I've lost her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--lost her?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was dark,\" said I--and it's funny how my head was clearing up--\"and\r\nthe door was open--the store-room door--and I was after her--and I guess\r\nshe stumbled, maybe--and I lost her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Johnson,\" said he, \"what do you mean? You sound crazy--downright crazy.\r\nWho?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her,\" said I. \"Fedderson's wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Who?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Her,\" said I. And with that he gave my arm another jerk.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said he, like a tiger. \"Don't try that on me. It won't do any\r\ngood--that kind of lies--not where _you're_ going to. Fedderson and his\r\nwife, too--the both of 'em's drowned deader 'n a door-nail.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said I, nodding my head. I was so calm it made him wild.\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy! Crazy as a loon, Johnson!\" And he was chewing his lip\r\nred. \"I know, because it was me that found the old man laying on Back\r\nWater Flats yesterday morning--_me!_ And she'd been with him in the\r\nboat, too, because he had a piece of her jacket tore off, tangled in his\r\narm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said I, nodding again, like that.\r\n\r\n\"You know _what_, you _crazy, murdering fool_?\" Those were his words to\r\nme, sir.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said I, \"what I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And _I_ know,\" said he, \"what _I_ know.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there you are, sir. He's Inspector. I'm--nobody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Gate\r\n\r\nBY MYLA JO CLOSSER\r\n\r\n     From the _Century Magazine_. By permission of the Century Company\r\n     and Myla J. Closser.\r\n\r\n\r\nA shaggy Airedale scented his way along the highroad. He had not been\r\nthere before, but he was guided by the trail of his brethren who had\r\npreceded him. He had gone unwillingly upon this journey, yet with the\r\nperfect training of dogs he had accepted it without complaint. The path\r\nhad been lonely, and his heart would have failed him, traveling as he\r\nmust without his people, had not these traces of countless dogs before\r\nhim promised companionship of a sort at the end of the road.\r\n\r\nThe landscape had appeared arid at first, for the translation from\r\nrecent agony into freedom from pain had been so numbing in its swiftness\r\nthat it was some time before he could fully appreciate the pleasant\r\ndog-country through which he was passing. There were woods with leaves\r\nupon the ground through which to scurry, long grassy slopes for extended\r\nruns, and lakes into which he might plunge for sticks and bring them\r\nback to--But he did not complete his thought, for the boy was not with\r\nhim. A little wave of homesickness possessed him.\r\n\r\nIt made his mind easier to see far ahead a great gate as high as the\r\nheavens, wide enough for all. He understood that only man built such\r\nbarriers and by straining his eyes he fancied he could discern humans\r\npassing through to whatever lay beyond. He broke into a run that he\r\nmight the more quickly gain this inclosure made beautiful by men and\r\nwomen; but his thoughts outran his pace, and he remembered that he had\r\nleft the family behind, and again this lovely new compound became not\r\nperfect, since it would lack the family.\r\n\r\nThe scent of the dogs grew very strong now, and coming nearer, he\r\ndiscovered, to his astonishment that of the myriads of those who had\r\narrived ahead of him thousands were still gathered on the outside of the\r\nportal. They sat in a wide circle spreading out on each side of the\r\nentrance, big, little, curly, handsome, mongrel, thoroughbred dogs of\r\nevery age, complexion, and personality. All were apparently waiting for\r\nsomething, someone, and at the pad of the Airedale's feet on the hard\r\nroad they arose and looked in his direction.\r\n\r\nThat the interest passed as soon as they discovered the new-comer to be\r\na dog puzzled him. In his former dwelling-place a four-footed brother\r\nwas greeted with enthusiasm when he was a friend, with suspicious\r\ndiplomacy when a stranger, and with sharp reproof when an enemy; but\r\nnever had he been utterly ignored.\r\n\r\nHe remembered something that he had read many times on great buildings\r\nwith lofty entrances. \"Dogs not admitted,\" the signs had said, and he\r\nfeared this might be the reason for the waiting circle outside the gate.\r\nIt might be that this noble portal stood as the dividing-line between\r\nmere dogs and humans. But he had been a member of the family, romping\r\nwith them in the living-room, sitting at meals with them in the\r\ndining-room, going upstairs at night with them, and the thought that he\r\nwas to be \"kept out\" would be unendurable.\r\n\r\nHe despised the passive dogs. They should be treating a barrier after\r\nthe fashion of their old country, leaping against it, barking, and\r\nscratching the nicely painted door. He bounded up the last little hill\r\nto set them an example, for he was still full of the rebellion of the\r\nworld; but he found no door to leap against. He could see beyond the\r\nentrance dear masses of people, yet no dog crossed the threshold. They\r\ncontinued in their patient ring, their gaze upon the winding road.\r\n\r\nHe now advanced cautiously to examine the gate. It occurred to him that\r\nit must be fly-time in this region, and he did not wish to make himself\r\nridiculous before all these strangers by trying to bolt through an\r\ninvisible mesh like the one that had baffled him when he was a little\r\nchap. Yet there were no screens, and despair entered his soul. What\r\nbitter punishment these poor beasts must have suffered before they\r\nlearned to stay on this side the arch that led to human beings! What\r\nhad they done on earth to merit this? Stolen bones troubled his\r\nconscience, runaway days, sleeping in the best chair until the key\r\nclicked in the lock. These were sins.\r\n\r\nAt that moment an English bull-terrier, white, with liver-colored spots\r\nand a jaunty manner, approached him, snuffling in a friendly way. No\r\nsooner had the bull-terrier smelt his collar than he fell to expressing\r\nhis joy at meeting him. The Airedale's reserve was quite thawed by this\r\nwelcome, though he did not know just what to make of it.\r\n\r\n\"I know you! I know you!\" exclaimed the bull-terrier, adding\r\ninconsequently, \"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tam o'Shanter. They call me Tammy,\" was the answer, with a pardonable\r\nbreak in the voice.\r\n\r\n\"I know them,\" said the bull-terrier. \"Nice folks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Best ever,\" said the Airedale, trying to be nonchalant, and scratching\r\na flea which was not there. \"I don't remember you. When did you know\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"About fourteen tags ago, when they were first married. We keep track of\r\ntime here by the license-tags. I had four.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is my first and only one. You were before my time, I guess.\" He\r\nfelt young and shy.\r\n\r\n\"Come for a walk, and tell me all about them,\" was his new friend's\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't we allowed in there?\" asked Tam, looking toward the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. You can go in whenever you want to. Some of us do at first, but\r\nwe don't stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like it better outside?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; it isn't that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why are all you fellows hanging around here? Any old dog can see\r\nit's better beyond the arch.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, we're waiting for our folks to come.\"\r\n\r\nThe Airedale grasped it at once, and nodded understandingly.\r\n\r\n\"I felt that way when I came along the road. It wouldn't be what it's\r\nsupposed to be without them. It wouldn't be the perfect place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to us,\" said the bull-terrier.\r\n\r\n\"Fine! I've stolen bones, but it must be that I have been forgiven, if\r\nI'm to see them here again. It's the great good place all right. But\r\nlook here,\" he added as a new thought struck him, \"do they wait for us?\"\r\n\r\nThe older inhabitant coughed in slight embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"The humans couldn't do that very well. It wouldn't be the thing to have\r\nthem hang around outside for just a dog--not dignified.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" agreed Tam. \"I'm glad they go straight to their mansions.\r\nI'd--I'd hate to have them missing me as I am missing them.\" He sighed.\r\n\"But, then, they wouldn't have to wait so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, they're getting on. Don't be discouraged,\" comforted the\r\nterrier. \"And in the meantime it's like a big hotel in summer--watching\r\nthe new arrivals. See, there is something doing now.\"\r\n\r\nAll the dogs were aroused to excitement by a little figure making its\r\nway uncertainly up the last slope. Half of them started to meet it,\r\ncrowding about in a loving, eager pack.\r\n\r\n\"Look out; don't scare it,\" cautioned the older animals, while word was\r\npassed to those farthest from the gate: \"Quick! Quick! A baby's come!\"\r\n\r\nBefore they had entirely assembled, however, a gaunt yellow hound pushed\r\nthrough the crowd, gave one sniff at the small child, and with a yelp of\r\njoy crouched at its feet. The baby embraced the hound in recognition,\r\nand the two moved toward the gate. Just outside the hound stopped to\r\nspeak to an aristocratic St. Bernard who had been friendly:\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to leave you, old fellow,\" he said, \"but I'm going in to watch\r\nover the kid. You see, I'm all she has up here.\"\r\n\r\nThe bull-terrier looked at the Airedale for appreciation.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way we do it,\" he said proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but--\" the Airedale put his head on one side in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what?\" asked the guide.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs that don't have any people--the nobodies' dogs?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the best of all. Oh, everything is thought out here. Crouch\r\ndown,--you must be tired,--and watch,\" said the bull-terrier.\r\n\r\nSoon they spied another small form making the turn in the road. He wore\r\na Boy Scout's uniform, but he was a little fearful, for all that, so new\r\nwas this adventure. The dogs rose again and snuffled, but the better\r\ngroomed of the circle held back, and in their place a pack of odds and\r\nends of the company ran down to meet him. The Boy Scout was reassured by\r\ntheir friendly attitude, and after petting them impartially, he chose an\r\nold-fashioned black and tan, and the two passed in.\r\n\r\nTam looked questioningly.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't know each other!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"But they've always wanted to. That's one of the boys who used to beg\r\nfor a dog, but his father wouldn't let him have one. So all our strays\r\nwait for just such little fellows to come along. Every boy gets a dog,\r\nand every dog gets a master.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect the boy's father would like to know that now,\" commented the\r\nAiredale. \"No doubt he thinks quite often, 'I wish I'd let him have a\r\ndog.'\"\r\n\r\nThe bull-terrier laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You're pretty near the earth yet, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\nTam admitted it.\r\n\r\n\"I've a lot of sympathy with fathers and with boys, having them both in\r\nthe family, and a mother as well.\"\r\n\r\nThe bull-terrier leaped up in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say they keep a boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure; greatest boy on earth. Ten this year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, this is news! I wish they'd kept a boy when I was there.\"\r\n\r\nThe Airedale looked at his new friend intently.\r\n\r\n\"See here, who are you?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nBut the other hurried on:\r\n\r\n\"I used to run away from them just to play with a boy. They'd punish me,\r\nand I always wanted to tell them it was their fault for not getting\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, anyway?\" repeated Tam. \"Talking all this interest in me,\r\ntoo. Whose dog _were_ you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've already guessed. I see it in your quivering snout. I'm the old\r\ndog that had to leave them about ten years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their old dog Bully?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm Bully.\" They nosed each other with deeper affection, then\r\nstrolled about the glades shoulder to shoulder. Bully the more eagerly\r\npressed for news. \"Tell me, how are they getting along?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well indeed; they've paid for the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I suppose you occupy the kennel?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. They said they couldn't stand it to see another dog in your old\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nBully stopped to howl gently.\r\n\r\n\"That touches me. It's generous in you to tell it. To think they missed\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nFor a little while they went on in silence, but as evening fell, and\r\nthe light from the golden streets inside of the city gave the only glow\r\nto the scene, Bully grew nervous and suggested that they go back.\r\n\r\n\"We can't see so well at night, and I like to be pretty close to the\r\npath, especially toward morning.\"\r\n\r\nTam assented.\r\n\r\n\"And I will point them out. You might not know them just at first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we know them. Sometimes the babies have so grown up they're rather\r\nhazy in their recollection of how we look. They think we're bigger than\r\nwe are; but you can't fool us dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's understood,\" Tam cunningly arranged, \"that when he or she arrives\r\nyou'll sort of make them feel at home while I wait for the boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the best plan,\" assented Bully, kindly. \"And if by any chance\r\nthe little fellow should come first,--there's been a lot of them this\r\nsummer--of course you'll introduce me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be proud to do it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so with muzzles sunk between their paws, and with their eyes\r\nstraining down the pilgrims' road, they wait outside the gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLigeia\r\n\r\nBY EDGAR ALLAN POE\r\n\r\n     And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the\r\n     mystery of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will\r\n     pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not\r\n     yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only\r\n     through the weakness of his feeble will.--_Joseph Glanvill._\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I\r\nfirst became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years have since\r\nelapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I\r\ncannot _now_ bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the\r\ncharacter of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast\r\nof beauty, and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low\r\nmusical language, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and\r\nstealthily progressive, that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet I\r\nbelieve that I met her first and most frequently in some large, old,\r\ndecaying city near the Rhine. Of her family--I have surely heard her\r\nspeak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia!\r\nLigeia! Buried in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to\r\ndeaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word\r\nalone--by Ligeia--that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of\r\nher who is no more. And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon\r\nme that I have _never known_ the paternal name of her who was my friend\r\nand my bethrothed, and who became the partner of my studies, and finally\r\nthe wife of my bosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia?\r\nor was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no\r\ninquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own--a\r\nwildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion?\r\nI but indistinctly recall the fact itself--what wonder that I have\r\nutterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it?\r\nAnd, indeed, if ever that spirit which is entitled _Romance_--if ever\r\nshe, the wan misty-winged _Ashtophet_ of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as\r\nthey tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nThere is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It\r\nis the _person_ of Ligeia. In stature she was tall, somewhat\r\nslender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated. I would in vain\r\nattempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease of her demeanor, or the\r\nincomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall. She came\r\nand departed as a shadow. I was never made aware of her entrance into\r\nmy closed study, save by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she\r\nplaced her marble hand upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden\r\never equaled her. It was the radiance of an opium-dream--an airy and\r\nspirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which\r\nhovered about the slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her\r\nfeatures were not of that regular mold which we have been falsely taught\r\nto worship in the classical labors of the heathen. \"There is no exquisite\r\nbeauty,\" says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and\r\n_genera_ of beauty, \"without some _strangeness_ in the proportion.\"\r\nYet, although I saw that the features of Ligeia were not of a classic\r\nregularity--although I perceived that her loveliness was indeed\r\n\"exquisite,\" and felt that there was much of \"strangeness\" pervading it,\r\nyet I have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my\r\nown perception of \"the strange.\" I examined the contour of the lofty and\r\npale forehead--it was faultless--how cold indeed that word when applied\r\nto a majesty so divine!--the skin rivaling the purest ivory, the\r\ncommanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above\r\nthe temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant, and\r\nnaturally-curling tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric\r\nepithet, \"hyacinthine!\" I looked at the delicate outlines of the\r\nnose--and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the Hebrews had I\r\nbeheld a similar perfection. There were the same luxurious smoothness of\r\nsurface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the\r\nsame harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I regarded\r\nthe sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly--the\r\nmagnificent turn of the short upper lip--the soft, voluptuous slumber of\r\nthe under--the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke--the\r\nteeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of\r\nthe holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid yet most\r\nexultingly radiant of all smiles. I scrutinized the formation of the\r\nchin--and, here, too, I found the gentleness of breadth, the softness\r\nand the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek--the\r\ncontour which the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the\r\nson of the Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.\r\n\r\nFor eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been,\r\ntoo, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord\r\nVerulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary\r\neyes of our own race. They were even fuller than the fullest of the\r\ngazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at\r\nintervals--in moments of intense excitement--that this peculiarity\r\nbecame more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was\r\nher beauty--in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps--the beauty of\r\nbeings either above or apart from the earth--the beauty of the fabulous\r\nHouri of the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black,\r\nand, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,\r\nslightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The \"strangeness,\"\r\nhowever, which I found in the eyes was of a nature distinct from the\r\nformation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must,\r\nafter all, be referred to the _expression_. Ah, word of no meaning!\r\nbehind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so\r\nmuch of the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for\r\nlong hours have I pondered upon it! How have I, through the whole of a\r\nmidsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it--that something\r\nmore profound than the well of Democritus--which lay far within the\r\npupils of my beloved? What _was_ it? I was possessed with a passion to\r\ndiscover. Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs!\r\nthey became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of\r\nastrologers.\r\n\r\nThere is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the\r\nscience of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact--never, I\r\nbelieve, noticed in the schools--than in our endeavors to recall to\r\nmemory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves _upon the very\r\nverge_ of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. And\r\nthus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes, have I\r\nfelt approaching the full knowledge of their expression--felt it\r\napproaching--yet not quite be mine--and so at length entirely depart!\r\nAnd (strange, oh, strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the commonest\r\nobjects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. I\r\nmean to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia's beauty passed\r\ninto my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from many\r\nexistences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt always\r\naround, within me, by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the more\r\ncould I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it. I\r\nrecognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly\r\ngrowing vine--in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis,\r\na stream of running water. I have felt it in the ocean--in the falling\r\nof a meteor. I have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people. And\r\nthere are one or two stars in heaven (one especially, a star of the\r\nsixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large star\r\nin Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the\r\nfeeling. I have been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed\r\ninstruments, and not unfrequently by passages from books. Among\r\ninnumerable other instances, I well remember something in a volume of\r\nJoseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness--who shall\r\nsay?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment: \"And the will\r\ntherein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will,\r\nwith its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by\r\nnature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto\r\ndeath utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.\"\r\n\r\nLength of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to trace,\r\nindeed, some remote connection between this passage in the English\r\nmoralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An _intensity_ in\r\nthought, action, or speech was possibly, in her, a result, or at least\r\nan index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse,\r\nfailed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence. Of\r\nall the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the\r\never-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous\r\nvultures of stern passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate,\r\nsave by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so\r\ndelighted and appalled me,--by the almost magical melody, modulation,\r\ndistinctness, and placidity of her very low voice,--and by the fierce\r\nenergy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of\r\nutterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense--such as I have\r\nnever known in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply\r\nproficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the\r\nmodern dialects of Europe, I have never known her at fault. Indeed upon\r\nany theme of the most admired because simply the most abstruse of the\r\nboasted erudition of the Academy, have I _ever_ found Ligeia at fault?\r\nHow singularly--how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife\r\nhas forced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said\r\nher knowledge was such as I have never known in woman--but where\r\nbreathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, _all_ the wide\r\nareas of moral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw not then what\r\nI now clearly perceive that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic,\r\nwere astounding; yet I was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy\r\nto resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through\r\nthe chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which I was most\r\nbusily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage. With how vast\r\na triumph--with how vivid a delight--with how much of all that is\r\nethereal in hope did I _feel_, as she bent over me in studies but little\r\nsought--but less known,--that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding\r\nbefore me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at\r\nlength pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to\r\nbe forbidden.\r\n\r\nHow poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some\r\nyears, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves\r\nand fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted. Her\r\npresence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many\r\nmysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting\r\nthe radiant luster of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller\r\nthan Saturnian lead. And now those eyes shone less and less frequently\r\nupon the pages over which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed\r\nwith a too--too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the\r\ntransparent waxen hue of the grave; and the blue veins upon the lofty\r\nforehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the most gentle\r\nemotion. I saw that she must die--and I struggled desperately in spirit\r\nwith the grim Azrael. And the struggles of the passionate wife were, to\r\nmy astonishment, even more energetic than my own. There had been much in\r\nher stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to her, death would\r\nhave come without its terrors; but not so. Words are impotent to convey\r\nany just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled\r\nwith the Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle. I would\r\nhave soothed--I would have reasoned; but in the intensity of her wild\r\ndesire for life--for life--_but_ for life--solace and reason were alike\r\nthe uttermost of folly. Yet not until the last instance, amid the most\r\nconvulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the external\r\nplacidity of her demeanor. Her voice grew more gentle--grew more\r\nlow--yet I would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly\r\nuttered words. My brain reeled as I hearkened, entranced, to a melody\r\nmore than mortal--to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had\r\nnever before known.\r\n\r\nThat she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have been\r\neasily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no\r\nordinary passion. But in death only was I fully impressed with the\r\nstrength of her affection. For long hours, detaining my hand, would she\r\npour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate\r\ndevotion amounted to idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by\r\nsuch confessions?--how had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal\r\nof my beloved in the hour of my making them? But upon this subject I\r\ncannot bear to dilate. Let me say only, that in Ligeia's more than\r\nwomanly abandonment to a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthily\r\nbestowed, I at length, recognized the principle of her longing, with so\r\nwildly earnest a desire, for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly\r\naway. It is this wild longing--it is this eager vehemence of desire for\r\nlife--_but_ for life--that I have no power to portray--no utterance\r\ncapable of expressing.\r\n\r\nAt high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,\r\nperemptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by\r\nherself not many days before. I obeyed her. They were these:--\r\n\r\n    Lo! 'tis a gala night\r\n      Within the lonesome latter years!\r\n    An angel throng, bewinged, bedight\r\n      In veils, and drowned in tears,\r\n    Sit in a theatre, to see\r\n      A play of hopes and fears,\r\n    While the orchestra breathes fitfully\r\n      The music of the spheres.\r\n\r\n    Mimes, in the form of God on high,\r\n      Mutter and mumble low,\r\n    And hither and thither fly;\r\n      Mere puppets they, who come and go\r\n    At bidding of vast formless things\r\n      That shift the scenery to and fro,\r\n    Flapping from out their condor wings\r\n      Invisible Wo!\r\n\r\n    That motley drama!--oh, be sure\r\n      It shall not be forgot!\r\n    With its Phantom chased for evermore\r\n      By a crowd that seize it not,\r\n    Through a circle that ever returneth in\r\n      To the self-same spot;\r\n    And much of Madness, and more of Sin\r\n      And Horror, the soul of the plot!\r\n\r\n    But see, amid the mimic rout,\r\n      A crawling shape intrude!\r\n    A blood-red thing that writhes from out\r\n      The scenic solitude!\r\n    It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs\r\n      The mimes become its food,\r\n    And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs\r\n      In human gore imbued.\r\n\r\n    Out--out are the lights--out all:\r\n      And over each quivering form,\r\n    The curtain, a funeral pall,\r\n      Comes down with the rush of a storm--\r\n    And the angels, all pallid and wan,\r\n      Uprising, unveiling, affirm\r\n    That the play is the tragedy, \"Man,\"\r\n      And its hero, the conqueror Worm.\r\n\r\n\"O God!\" half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her\r\narms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these\r\nlines--\"O God! O Divine Father!--shall these things be undeviatingly\r\nso?--shall this conqueror be not once conquered? Are we not part and\r\nparcel in Thee? Who--who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its\r\nvigor? Man doth not yield him to the angels, _nor unto death utterly_,\r\nsave only through the weakness of his feeble will.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to\r\nfall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her\r\nlast sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I\r\nbent to them my ear, and distinguished, again, the concluding words of\r\nthe passage in Glanvill: \"_Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor\r\nunto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will._\"\r\n\r\nShe died: and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no longer\r\nendure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying\r\ncity by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls wealth. Ligeia\r\nhad brought me far more, very far more, than ordinarily falls to the lot\r\nof mortals. After a few months, therefore, of weary and aimless\r\nwandering, I purchased and put in some repair, an abbey, which I shall\r\nnot name, in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair\r\nEngland. The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost\r\nsavage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored\r\nmemories connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of\r\nutter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial\r\nregion of the country. Yet although the external abbey, with its verdant\r\ndecay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, I gave way, with\r\na child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating\r\nmy sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within. For\r\nsuch follies, even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste, and now they\r\ncame back to me as if in the dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even\r\nof incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and\r\nfantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild\r\ncornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted\r\ngold! I had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my\r\nlabors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. But these\r\nabsurdities I must not pause to detail. Let me speak only of that one\r\nchamber, ever accursed, whither, in a moment of mental alienation, I led\r\nfrom the altar as my bride--as the successor of the unforgotten\r\nLigeia--the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of\r\nTremaine.\r\n\r\nThere is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of\r\nthat bridal chamber which is not visibly before me. Where were the souls\r\nof the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they\r\npermitted to pass the threshold of an apartment _so_ bedecked, a maiden\r\nand a daughter so beloved? I have said, that I minutely remember the\r\ndetails of the chamber--yet I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep\r\nmoment; and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic\r\ndisplay to take hold upon the memory. The room lay in a high turret of\r\nthe castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size.\r\nOccupying the whole southern face of the pentagonal was the sole\r\nwindow--an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice--a single pane,\r\nand tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon\r\npassing through it, fell with a ghastly luster on the objects within.\r\nOver the upper portion of this huge window extended the trellis-work of\r\nan aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls of the turret. The\r\nceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and\r\nelaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a\r\nsemi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of\r\nthis melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with long\r\nlinks, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with\r\nmany perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them, as\r\nif endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of\r\nparti-colored fires.\r\n\r\nSome few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in\r\nvarious stations about; and there was the couch, too--the bridal\r\ncouch--of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with\r\na pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the chamber stood on\r\nend a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings\r\nover against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture.\r\nBut in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of\r\nall. The lofty walls, gigantic in height--even unproportionably so--were\r\nhung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and\r\nmassive-looking tapestry--tapestry of a material which was found alike\r\nas a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony\r\nbed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the\r\ncurtains which partially shaded the window. The material was the richest\r\ncloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with\r\narabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth\r\nin patterns of the most jetty black. But these figures partook of the\r\ntrue character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single point\r\nof view. By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very\r\nremote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one\r\nentering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but\r\nupon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and, step by\r\nstep, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself\r\nsurrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to\r\nthe superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the\r\nmonk. The phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial\r\nintroduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the\r\ndraperies--giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.\r\n\r\nIn halls such as these--in a bridal chamber such as this--I passed, with\r\nthe Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our\r\nmarriage--passed them with but little disquietude. That my wife dreaded\r\nthe fierce moodiness of my temper--that she shunned me, and loved me but\r\nlittle--I could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than\r\notherwise. I loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to\r\nman. My memory flew back (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to Ligeia,\r\nthe beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. I reveled in\r\nrecollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty--her ethereal\r\nnature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then, did my spirit\r\nfully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own. In the\r\nexcitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually fettered in the\r\nshackles of the drug), I would call aloud upon her name, during the\r\nsilence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by\r\nday, as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the\r\nconsuming ardor of my longing for the departed, I could restore her to\r\nthe pathways she had abandoned--ah, _could_ it be forever?--upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAbout the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the Lady\r\nRowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was\r\nslow. The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in\r\nher perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of\r\nmotions, in and about the chamber of the turret, which I concluded had\r\nno origin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the\r\nphantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself. She became at length\r\nconvalescent--finally, well. Yet but a second more violent disorder\r\nagain threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame,\r\nat all times feeble, never altogether recovered. Her illnesses were,\r\nafter this epoch, of alarming character, and of more alarming\r\nrecurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her\r\nphysicians. With the increase of the chronic disease, which had thus,\r\napparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated\r\nby human means, I could not fail to observe a similar increase in the\r\nnervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by\r\ntrivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more frequently and\r\npertinaciously, of the sounds--of the slight sounds--and of the unusual\r\nmotions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly alluded.\r\n\r\nOne night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this\r\ndistressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She\r\nhad just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with\r\nfeelings half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her\r\nemaciated countenance. I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of\r\nthe ottomans of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low\r\nwhisper, of sounds which she _then_ heard, but which I could not\r\nhear--of motions which she _then_ saw, but which I could not perceive.\r\nThe wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to\r\nshow her (what, let me confess it, I could not _all_ believe) that those\r\nalmost inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the\r\nfigures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that customary\r\nrushing of the wind. But a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had\r\nproved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless. She\r\nappeared to be fainting, and no attendants were within call. I\r\nremembered where was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been\r\nordered by her physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure\r\nit. But, as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two\r\ncircumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention. I had felt\r\nthat some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my\r\nperson; and I saw that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very\r\nmiddle of the rich luster thrown from the censer, a shadow--a faint,\r\nindefinite shadow of angelic aspect--such as might be fancied for the\r\nshadow of a shade. But I was wild with the excitement of an immoderate\r\ndose of opium, and heeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to\r\nRowena. Having found the wine, I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a\r\ngobletful, which I held to the lips of the fainting lady. She had now\r\npartially recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while I sank\r\nupon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person. It was\r\nthen that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the\r\ncarpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was in\r\nthe act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that\r\nI saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the\r\natmosphere of the room, three or four large drops of a brilliant and\r\nruby colored fluid. If this I saw--not so Rowena. She swallowed the wine\r\nunhesitatingly, and I forebore to speak to her of a circumstance which\r\nmust, after all, I considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid\r\nimagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the\r\nopium, and by the hour.\r\n\r\nYet I cannot conceal [Transcriber's note: The original reads \"coneal\".]\r\nit from my own perception that, immediately subsequent to the fall of\r\nthe ruby drops, a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder\r\nof my wife; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands of her\r\nmenials prepared her for the tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with\r\nher shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber which had received her as\r\nmy bride. Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before\r\nme. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the\r\nroom, upon the varying figures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of\r\nthe parti-colored fires in the censer overhead. My eyes then fell, as I\r\ncalled to mind the circumstances of a former night, to the spot beneath\r\nthe glare of the censer where I had seen the faint traces of the shadow.\r\nIt was there, however, no longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I\r\nturned my glances to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. Then\r\nrushed upon me a thousand memories of Ligeia--and then came back upon my\r\nheart, with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that\r\nunutterable woe with which I had regarded _her_ thus enshrouded. The\r\nnight waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one\r\nonly and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the body of Rowena.\r\n\r\nIt might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had\r\ntaken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct,\r\nstartled me from my revery. I _felt_ that it came from the bed of\r\nebony--the bed of death. I listened in an agony of superstitious\r\nterror--but there was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vision\r\nto detect any motion in the corpse--but there was not the slightest\r\nperceptible. Yet I could not have been deceived. I _had_ heard the\r\nnoise, however faint, and my soul was awakened within me. I resolutely\r\nand perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes\r\nelapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the\r\nmystery. At length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and\r\nbarely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and\r\nalong the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of\r\nunutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no\r\nsufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my\r\nlimbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of duty finally operated to\r\nrestore my self-possession. I could no longer doubt that we had been\r\nprecipitate in our preparations--that Rowena still lived. It was\r\nnecessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was\r\naltogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the\r\nservants--there were none within call--I had no means of summoning them\r\nto my aid without leaving the room for many minutes--and this I could\r\nnot venture to do. I therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call\r\nback the spirit still hovering. In a short period it was certain,\r\nhowever, that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both\r\neyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the\r\nlips became doubly shriveled and pinched up in the ghastly expression of\r\ndeath; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the\r\nsurface of the body; and all the usual rigorous stiffness immediately\r\nsupervened. I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which I had\r\nbeen so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate\r\nwaking visions of Ligeia.\r\n\r\nAn hour thus elapsed, when (could it be possible?) I was a second time\r\naware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. I\r\nlistened--in extremity of horror. The sound came again--it was a sigh.\r\nRushing to the corpse, I saw--distinctly saw--a tremor upon the lips. In\r\na minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly\r\nteeth. Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which\r\nhad hitherto reigned there alone. I felt that my vision grew dim, that\r\nmy reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effort that I at length\r\nsucceeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had\r\npointed out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the\r\ncheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there\r\nwas even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady _lived_; and with\r\nredoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of restoration. I chafed and\r\nbathed the temples and the hands and used every exertion which\r\nexperience, and no little medical reading, could suggest. But in vain.\r\nSuddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the\r\nexpression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body\r\ntook upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense\r\nrigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of\r\nthat which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.\r\n\r\nAnd again I sunk into visions of Ligeia--and again (what marvel that I\r\nshudder while I write?), _again_ there reached my ears a low sob from\r\nthe region of the ebony bed. But why shall I minutely detail the\r\nunspeakable horrors of that night? Why shall I pause to relate how, time\r\nafter time, until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama\r\nof revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into\r\na sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore\r\nthe aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle\r\nwas succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personal\r\nappearance of the corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had\r\nbeen dead once again stirred--and now more vigorously than hitherto,\r\nalthough arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter\r\nhopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or to move, and\r\nremained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl\r\nof violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least\r\nterrible, the least consuming. The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now\r\nmore vigorously than before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted\r\nenergy into the countenance--the limbs relaxed--and, save that the\r\neyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and\r\ndraperies of the grave still imparted their charnel character to the\r\nfigure, I might have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly,\r\nthe fetters of Death. But if this idea was not, even then, altogether\r\nadopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed,\r\ntottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of\r\none bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly\r\nand palpably into the middle of the apartment.\r\n\r\nI trembled not--I stirred not--for a crowd of unutterable fancies\r\nconnected with the air, the stature, the demeanor, of the figure,\r\nrushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed--had chilled me into\r\nstone. I stirred not--but gazed upon the apparition. There was a mad\r\ndisorder in my thoughts--a tumult unappeasable. Could it, indeed, be the\r\n_living_ Rowena who confronted me? Could it, indeed, be Rowena _at\r\nall_--the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine?\r\nWhy, _why_ should I doubt it? The bandage lay heavily about the\r\nmouth--but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady of\r\nTremaine? And the cheeks--there were the roses as in her noon of\r\nlife--yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living Lady of\r\nTremaine. And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be\r\nhers?--but _had she then grown taller since her malady?_ What\r\ninexpressible madness seized me with that thought? One bound, and I had\r\nreached her feet! Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head,\r\nunloosened, the ghastly cerements which had confined it, and there\r\nstreamed forth into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber huge masses of\r\nlong and disheveled hair; _it was blacker than the raven wings of\r\nmidnight._ And now slowly opened _the eyes_ of the figure which stood\r\nbefore me. \"Here then, at least,\" I shrieked aloud, \"can I never--can I\r\nnever be mistaken--these are the full, and the black, and the wild\r\neyes--of my lost love--of the Lady--of the LADY LIGEIA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Haunted Orchard\r\n\r\nBY RICHARD LE GALLIENNE\r\n\r\n     From _Harper's Magazine_, January, 1912. By permission of Harper\r\n     and Brothers and Richard Le Gallienne.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring was once more in the world. As she sang to herself in the faraway\r\nwoodlands her voice reached even the ears of the city, weary with the\r\nlong winter. Daffodils flowered at the entrances to the Subway,\r\nfurniture removing vans blocked the side streets, children clustered\r\nlike blossoms on the doorsteps, the open cars were running, and the cry\r\nof the \"cash clo'\" man was once more heard in the land.\r\n\r\nYes, it was the spring, and the city dreamed wistfully of lilacs and the\r\ndewy piping of birds in gnarled old apple-trees, of dogwood lighting up\r\nwith sudden silver the thickening woods, of water-plants unfolding their\r\nglossy scrolls in pools of morning freshness.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday mornings, the outbound trains were thronged with eager\r\npilgrims, hastening out of the city, to behold once more the ancient\r\nmarvel of the spring; and, on Sunday evenings, the railway termini were\r\naflower with banners of blossom from rifled woodland and orchard carried\r\nin the hands of the returning pilgrims, whose eyes still shone with the\r\nspring magic, in whose ears still sang the fairy music.\r\n\r\nAnd as I beheld these signs of the vernal equinox I knew that I, too,\r\nmust follow the music, forsake awhile the beautiful siren we call the\r\ncity, and in the green silences meet once more my sweetheart Solitude.\r\n\r\nAs the train drew out of the Grand Central, I hummed to myself,\r\n\r\n    \"I've a neater, sweeter maiden, in a greener, cleaner land\"\r\n\r\nand so I said good-by to the city, and went forth with beating heart to\r\nmeet the spring.\r\n\r\nI had been told of an almost forgotten corner on the south coast of\r\nConnecticut, where the spring and I could live in an inviolate\r\nloneliness--a place uninhabited save by birds and blossoms, woods and\r\nthick grass, and an occasional silent farmer, and pervaded by the breath\r\nand shimmer of the Sound.\r\n\r\nNor had rumor lied, for when the train set me down at my destination I\r\nstepped out into the most wonderful green hush, a leafy Sabbath silence\r\nthrough which the very train, as it went farther on its way, seemed to\r\nsteal as noiselessly as possible for fear of breaking the spell.\r\n\r\nAfter a winter in the town, to be dropped thus suddenly into the intense\r\nquiet of the country-side makes an almost ghostly impression upon one,\r\nas of an enchanted silence, a silence that listens and watches but\r\nnever speaks, finger on lip. There is a spectral quality about\r\neverything upon which the eye falls: the woods, like great green clouds,\r\nthe wayside flowers, the still farm-houses half lost in orchard\r\nbloom--all seem to exist in a dream. Everything is so still, everything\r\nso supernaturally green. Nothing moves or talks, except the gentle\r\nsusurrus of the spring wind swaying the young buds high up in the quiet\r\nsky, or a bird now and again, or a little brook singing softly to itself\r\namong the crowding rushes.\r\n\r\nThough, from the houses one notes here and there, there are evidently\r\nhuman inhabitants of this green silence, none are to be seen. I have\r\noften wondered where the countryfolk hide themselves, as I have walked\r\nhour after hour, past farm and croft and lonely door-yards, and never\r\ncaught sight of a human face. If you should want to ask the way, a\r\nfarmer is as shy as a squirrel, and if you knock at a farm-house door,\r\nall is as silent as a rabbit-warren.\r\n\r\nAs I walked along in the enchanted stillness, I came at length to a\r\nquaint old farm-house--\"old Colonial\" in its architecture--embowered in\r\nwhite lilacs, and surrounded by an orchard of ancient apple-trees which\r\ncast a rich shade on the deep spring grass. The orchard had the\r\nimpressiveness of those old religious groves, dedicated to the strange\r\nworship of sylvan gods, gods to be found now only in Horace or Catullus,\r\nand in the hearts of young poets to whom the beautiful antique Latin is\r\nstill dear.\r\n\r\nThe old house seemed already the abode of Solitude. As I lifted the\r\nlatch of the white gate and walked across the forgotten grass, and up on\r\nto the veranda already festooned with wistaria, and looked into the\r\nwindow, I saw Solitude sitting by an old piano, on which no composer\r\nlater than Bach had ever been played.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the house was empty; and going round to the back, where\r\nold barns and stables leaned together as if falling asleep, I found a\r\nbroken pane, and so climbed in and walked through the echoing rooms. The\r\nhouse was very lonely. Evidently no one had lived in it for a long time.\r\nYet it was all ready for some occupant, for whom it seemed to be\r\nwaiting. Quaint old four-poster bedsteads stood in three rooms--dimity\r\ncurtains and spotless linen--old oak chests and mahogany presses; and,\r\nopening drawers in Chippendale sideboards, I came upon beautiful frail\r\nold silver and exquisite china that set me thinking of a beautiful\r\ngrandmother of mine, made out of old lace and laughing wrinkles and\r\nmischievous old blue eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was one little room that particularly interested me, a tiny\r\nbedroom all white, and at the window the red roses were already in bud.\r\nBut what caught my eye with peculiar sympathy was a small bookcase, in\r\nwhich were some twenty or thirty volumes, wearing the same forgotten\r\nexpression--forgotten and yet cared for--which lay like a kind of\r\nmemorial charm upon everything in the old house. Yes, everything seemed\r\nforgotten and yet everything, curiously--even religiously--remembered. I\r\ntook out book after book from the shelves, once or twice flowers fell\r\nout from the pages--and I caught sight of a delicate handwriting here\r\nand there and frail markings. It was evidently the little intimate\r\nlibrary of a young girl. What surprised me most was to find that quite\r\nhalf the books were in French--French poets and French romancers: a\r\ncharming, very rare edition of Ronsard, a beautifully printed edition of\r\nAlfred de Musset, and a copy of Théophile Gautier's _Mademoiselle de\r\nMaupin_. How did these exotic books come to be there alone in a deserted\r\nNew England farm-house?\r\n\r\nThis question was to be answered later in a strange way. Meanwhile I had\r\nfallen in love with the sad, old, silent place, and as I closed the\r\nwhite gate and was once more on the road, I looked about for someone who\r\ncould tell me whether or not this house of ghosts might be rented for\r\nthe summer by a comparatively living man.\r\n\r\nI was referred to a fine old New England farm-house shining white\r\nthrough the trees a quarter of a mile away. There I met an ancient\r\ncouple, a typical New England farmer and his wife; the old man, lean,\r\nchin-bearded, with keen gray eyes flickering occasionally with a shrewd\r\nhumor, the old lady with a kindly old face of the withered-apple type\r\nand ruddy. They were evidently prosperous people, but their minds--for\r\nsome reason I could not at the moment divine--seemed to be divided\r\nbetween their New England desire to drive a hard bargain and their\r\ndisinclination to let the house at all.\r\n\r\nOver and over again they spoke of the loneliness of the place. They\r\nfeared I would find it very lonely. No one had lived in it for a long\r\ntime, and so on. It seemed to me that afterwards I understood their\r\ncurious hesitation, but at the moment only regarded it as a part of the\r\ncircuitous New England method of bargaining. At all events, the rent I\r\noffered finally overcame their disinclination, whatever its cause, and\r\nso I came into possession--for four months--of that silent old house,\r\nwith the white lilacs, and the drowsy barns, and the old piano, and the\r\nstrange orchard; and, as the summer came on, and the year changed its\r\nname from May to June, I used to lie under the apple-trees in the\r\nafternoons, dreamily reading some old book, and through half-sleepy\r\neyelids watching the silken shimmer of the Sound.\r\n\r\nI had lived in the old house for about a month, when one afternoon a\r\nstrange thing happened to me. I remember the date well. It was the\r\nafternoon of Tuesday, June 13th. I was reading, or rather dipping here\r\nand there, in Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_. As I read, I remember\r\nthat a little unripe apple, with a petal or two of blossom still\r\nclinging to it, fell upon the old yellow page. Then I suppose I must\r\nhave fallen into a dream, though it seemed to me that both my eyes and\r\nmy ears were wide open, for I suddenly became aware of a beautiful\r\nyoung voice singing very softly somewhere among the leaves. The singing\r\nwas very frail, almost imperceptible, as though it came out of the air.\r\nIt came and went fitfully, like the elusive fragrance of sweetbrier--as\r\nthough a girl was walking to and fro, dreamily humming to herself in the\r\nstill afternoon. Yet there was no one to be seen. The orchard had never\r\nseemed more lonely. And another fact that struck me as strange was that\r\nthe words that floated to me out of the aerial music were French, half\r\nsad, half gay snatches of some long-dead singer of old France, I looked\r\nabout for the origin of the sweet sounds, but in vain. Could it be the\r\nbirds that were singing in French in this strange orchard? Presently the\r\nvoice seemed to come quite close to me, so near that it might have been\r\nthe voice of a dryad singing to me out of the tree against which I was\r\nleaning. And this time I distinctly caught the words of the sad little\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n    _\"Chante, rossignol, chante,\r\n    Toi qui as le coeur gai;\r\n    Tu as le coeur à rire,\r\n    Moi, je l'ai-t-à pleurer.\"_\r\n\r\nBut, though the voice was at my shoulder, I could see no one, and then\r\nthe singing stopped with what sounded like a sob; and a moment or two\r\nlater I seemed to hear a sound of sobbing far down the orchard. Then\r\nthere followed silence, and I was left to ponder on the strange\r\noccurrence. Naturally, I decided that it was just a day-dream between\r\nsleeping and waking over the pages of an old book; yet when next day and\r\nthe day after the invisible singer was in the orchard again, I could not\r\nbe satisfied with such mere matter-of-fact explanation.\r\n\r\n    _\"A la claire fontaine,\"_\r\n\r\nwent the voice to and fro through the thick orchard boughs,\r\n\r\n    _\"M'en allant promener,\r\n    J'ai trouvé l'eau si belle\r\n    Que je m'y suis baigné,\r\n    Lui y a longtemps que je t'aime,\r\n    Jamais je ne t'oubliai.\"_\r\n\r\nIt was certainly uncanny to hear that voice going to and fro the\r\norchard, there somewhere amid the bright sun-dazzled boughs--yet not a\r\nhuman creature to be seen--not another house even within half a mile.\r\nThe most materialistic mind could hardly but conclude that here was\r\nsomething \"not dreamed of in our philosophy.\" It seemed to me that the\r\nonly reasonable explanation was the entirely irrational one--that my\r\norchard was haunted: haunted by some beautiful young spirit, with some\r\nsorrow of lost joy that would not let her sleep quietly in her grave.\r\n\r\nAnd next day I had a curious confirmation of my theory. Once more I was\r\nlying under my favorite apple-tree, half reading and half watching the\r\nSound, lulled into a dream by the whir of insects and the spices called\r\nup from the earth by the hot sun. As I bent over the page, I suddenly\r\nhad the startling impression that someone was leaning over my shoulder\r\nand reading with me, and that a girl's long hair was falling over me\r\ndown on to the page. The book was the Ronsard I had found in the little\r\nbedroom. I turned, but again there was nothing there. Yet this time I\r\nknew that I had not been dreaming, and I cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Poor child! tell me of your grief--that I may help your sorrowing heart\r\nto rest.\"\r\n\r\nBut, of course, there was no answer; yet that night I dreamed a strange\r\ndream. I thought I was in the orchard again in the afternoon and once\r\nagain heard the strange singing--but this time, as I looked up, the\r\nsinger was no longer invisible. Coming toward me was a young girl with\r\nwonderful blue eyes filled with tears and gold hair that fell to her\r\nwaist. She wore a straight, white robe that might have been a shroud or\r\na bridal dress. She appeared not to see me, though she came directly to\r\nthe tree where I was sitting. And there she knelt and buried her face in\r\nthe grass and sobbed as if her heart would break. Her long hair fell\r\nover her like a mantle, and in my dream I stroked it pityingly and\r\nmurmured words of comfort for a sorrow I did not understand.... Then I\r\nwoke suddenly as one does from dreams. The moon was shining brightly\r\ninto the room. Rising from my bed, I looked out into the orchard. It was\r\nalmost as bright as day. I could plainly see the tree of which I had\r\nbeen dreaming, and then a fantastic notion possessed me. Slipping on my\r\nclothes, I went out into one of the old barns and found a spade. Then I\r\nwent to the tree where I had seen the girl weeping in my dream and dug\r\ndown at its foot.\r\n\r\nI had dug little more than a foot when my spade struck upon some hard\r\nsubstance, and in a few more moments I had uncovered and exhumed a small\r\nbox, which, on examination, proved to be one of those pretty\r\nold-fashioned Chippendale work-boxes used by our grandmothers to keep\r\ntheir thimbles and needles in, their reels of cotton and skeins of silk.\r\nAfter smoothing down the little grave in which I had found it, I carried\r\nthe box into the house, and under the lamplight examined its contents.\r\n\r\nThen at once I understood why that sad young spirit went to and fro the\r\norchard singing those little French songs--for the treasure-trove I had\r\nfound under the apple-tree, the buried treasure of an unquiet, suffering\r\nsoul, proved to be a number of love-letters written mostly in French in\r\na very picturesque hand--letters, too, written but some five or six\r\nyears before. Perhaps I should not have read them--yet I read them with\r\nsuch reverence for the beautiful, impassioned love that animated them,\r\nand literally made them \"smell sweet and blossom in the dust,\" that I\r\nfelt I had the sanction of the dead to make myself the confidant of\r\ntheir story. Among the letters were little songs, two of which I had\r\nheard the strange young voice singing in the orchard, and, of course,\r\nthere were many withered flowers and such like remembrances of bygone\r\nrapture.\r\n\r\nNot that night could I make out all the story, though it was not\r\ndifficult to define its essential tragedy, and later on a gossip in the\r\nneighborhood and a headstone in the churchyard told me the rest. The\r\nunquiet young soul that had sung so wistfully to and fro the orchard was\r\nmy landlord's daughter. She was the only child of her parents, a\r\nbeautiful, willful girl, exotically unlike those from whom she was\r\nsprung and among whom she lived with a disdainful air of exile. She was,\r\nas a child, a little creature of fairy fancies, and as she grew up it\r\nwas plain to her father and mother that she had come from another world\r\nthan theirs. To them she seemed like a child in an old fairy-tale\r\nstrangely found on his hearth by some shepherd as he returns from the\r\nfields at evening--a little fairy girl swaddled in fine linen, and\r\ndowered with a mysterious bag of gold.\r\n\r\nSoon she developed delicate spiritual needs to which her simple parents\r\nwere strangers. From long truancies in the woods she would come home\r\nladen with mysterious flowers, and soon she came to ask for books and\r\npictures and music, of which the poor souls that had given her birth had\r\nnever heard. Finally she had her way, and went to study at a certain\r\nfashionable college; and there the brief romance of her life began.\r\nThere she met a romantic young Frenchman who had read Ronsard to her and\r\nwritten her those picturesque letters I had found in the old mahogany\r\nwork-box. And after a while the young Frenchman had gone back to France,\r\nand the letters had ceased. Month by month went by, and at length one\r\nday, as she sat wistful at the window, looking out at the foolish sunlit\r\nroad, a message came. He was dead. That headstone in the village\r\nchurchyard tells the rest. She was very young to die--scarcely nineteen\r\nyears; and the dead who have died young, with all their hopes and dreams\r\nstill like unfolded buds within their hearts, do not rest so quietly in\r\nthe grave as those who have gone through the long day from morning until\r\nevening and are only too glad to sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext day I took the little box to a quiet corner of the orchard, and\r\nmade a little pyre of fragrant boughs--for so I interpreted the wish of\r\nthat young, unquiet spirit--and the beautiful words are now safe, taken\r\nup again into the aerial spaces from which they came.\r\n\r\nBut since then the birds sing no more little French songs in my old\r\norchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bowmen\r\n\r\nBY ARTHUR MACHEN\r\n\r\n     From _The Bowmen_, by Arthur Machen. Published in England by\r\n     Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., Ltd., and in America by\r\n     G.P. Putnam's Sons. By permission of the publishers and Arthur\r\n     Machen.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during the Retreat of the Eighty Thousand, and the authority of\r\nthe Censorship is sufficient excuse for not being more explicit. But it\r\nwas on the most awful day of that awful time, on the day when ruin and\r\ndisaster came so near that their shadow fell over London far away; and,\r\nwithout any certain news, the hearts of men failed within them and grew\r\nfaint; as if the agony of the army in the battlefield had entered into\r\ntheir souls.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this dreadful day, then, when three hundred thousand men in arms with\r\nall their artillery swelled like a flood against the little English\r\ncompany, there was one point above all other points in our battle line\r\nthat was for a time in awful danger, not merely of defeat, but of utter\r\nannihilation. With the permission of the Censorship and of the military\r\nexpert, this corner may, perhaps, be described as a salient, and if this\r\nangle were crushed and broken, then the English force as a whole would\r\nbe shattered, the Allied left would be turned, and Sedan would\r\ninevitably follow.\r\n\r\nAll the morning the German guns had thundered and shrieked against this\r\ncorner, and against the thousand or so of men who held it. The men joked\r\nat the shells, and found funny names for them, and had bets about them,\r\nand greeted them with scraps of music-hall songs. But the shells came on\r\nand burst, and tore good Englishmen limb from limb, and tore brother\r\nfrom brother, and as the heat of the day increased so did the fury of\r\nthat terrific cannonade. There was no help, it seemed. The English\r\nartillery was good, but there was not nearly enough of it; it was being\r\nsteadily battered into scrap iron.\r\n\r\nThere comes a moment in a storm at sea when people say to one another,\r\n\"It is at its worst; it can blow no harder,\" and then there is a blast\r\nten times more fierce than any before it. So it was in these British\r\ntrenches.\r\n\r\nThere were no stouter hearts in the whole world than the hearts of these\r\nmen; but even they were appalled as this seven-times-heated hell of the\r\nGerman cannonade fell upon them and overwhelmed them and destroyed them.\r\nAnd at this very moment they saw from their trenches that a tremendous\r\nhost was moving against their lines. Five hundred of the thousand\r\nremained, and as far as they could see the German infantry was pressing\r\non against them, column upon column, a gray world of men, ten thousand\r\nof them, as it appeared afterwards.\r\n\r\nThere was no hope at all. They shook hands, some of them. One man\r\nimprovised a new version of the battle-song, \"Good-by, good-by to\r\nTipperary,\" ending with \"And we shan't get there.\" And they all went on\r\nfiring steadily. The officer pointed out that such an opportunity for\r\nhigh-class fancy shooting might never occur again; the Tipperary\r\nhumorist asked, \"What price Sidney Street?\" And the few machine guns did\r\ntheir best. But everybody knew it was of no use. The dead gray bodies\r\nlay in companies and battalions, as others came on and on and on, and\r\nthey swarmed and stirred, and advanced from beyond and beyond.\r\n\r\n\"World without end. Amen,\" said one of the British soldiers with some\r\nirrelevance as he took aim and fired. And then he remembered--he says he\r\ncannot think why or wherefore--a queer vegetarian restaurant in London\r\nwhere he had once or twice eaten eccentric dishes of cutlets made of\r\nlentils and nuts that pretended to be steak. On all the plates in this\r\nrestaurant there was printed a figure of St. George in blue, with the\r\nmotto, \"_Adsit Anglis Sanctus Georgius_\"--\"May St. George be a present\r\nhelp to the English.\" This soldier happened to know Latin and other\r\nuseless things, and now, as he fired at his man in the gray advancing\r\nmass--three hundred yards away--he uttered the pious vegetarian motto.\r\nHe went on firing to the end, and at last Bill on his right had to clout\r\nhim cheerfully over the head to make him stop, pointing out as he did so\r\nthat the King's ammunition cost money and was not lightly to be wasted\r\nin drilling funny patterns into dead Germans.\r\n\r\nFor as the Latin scholar uttered his invocation he felt something\r\nbetween a shudder and an electric shock pass through his body. The roar\r\nof the battle died down in his ears to a gentle murmur; instead of it,\r\nhe says, he heard a great voice and a shout louder than a thunder-peal\r\ncrying, \"Array, array, array!\"\r\n\r\nHis heart grew hot as a burning coal, it grew cold as ice within him, as\r\nit seemed to him that a tumult of voices answered to his summons. He\r\nheard, or seemed to hear, thousands shouting: \"St. George! St. George!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Messire, ha! sweet Saint, grant us good deliverance!\"\r\n\r\n\"St. George for merry England!\"\r\n\r\n\"Harow! Harow! Monseigneur St. George, succor us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! St. George! Ha! St. George! a long bow and a strong bow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven's Knight, aid us!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the soldier heard these voices he saw before him, beyond the\r\ntrench, a long line of shapes, with a shining about them. They were like\r\nmen who drew the bow, and with another shout, their cloud of arrows flew\r\nsinging and tingling through the air towards the German hosts.\r\n\r\nThe other men in the trench were firing all the while. They had no hope;\r\nbut they aimed just as if they had been shooting at Bisley.\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of them lifted up his voice in the plainest English.\r\n\r\n\"Gawd help us!\" he bellowed to the man next to him, \"but we're blooming\r\nmarvels! Look at those gray ... gentlemen, look at them! D'ye see them?\r\nThey're not going down in dozens nor in 'undreds; it's thousands, it is.\r\nLook! look! there's a regiment gone while I'm talking to ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut it!\" the other soldier bellowed, taking aim, \"what are ye gassing\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\nBut he gulped with astonishment even as he spoke, for, indeed, the gray\r\nmen were falling by the thousands. The English could hear the guttural\r\nscream of the German officers, the crackle of their revolvers as they\r\nshot the reluctant; and still line after line crashed to the earth.\r\n\r\nAll the while the Latin-bred soldier heard the cry:\r\n\r\n\"Harow! Harow! Monseigneur, dear Saint, quick to our aid! St. George\r\nhelp us!\"\r\n\r\n\"High Chevalier, defend us!\"\r\n\r\nThe singing arrows fled so swift and thick that they darkened the air,\r\nthe heathen horde melted from before them.\r\n\r\n\"More machine guns!\" Bill yelled to Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Don't hear them,\" Tom yelled back.\r\n\r\n\"But, thank God, anyway; they've got it in the neck.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, there were ten thousand dead German soldiers left before that\r\nsalient of the English army, and consequently there was no Sedan. In\r\nGermany, a country ruled by scientific principles, the Great General\r\nStaff decided that the contemptible English must have employed shells\r\ncontaining an unknown gas of a poisonous nature, as no wounds were\r\ndiscernible on the bodies of the dead German soldiers. But the man who\r\nknew what nuts tasted like when they called themselves steak knew also\r\nthat St. George had brought his Agincourt Bowmen to help the English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Ghost\r\n\r\nBY GUY DE MAUPASSANT\r\n\r\n     Translated for this volume by M. Charles Sommer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were speaking of sequestration, alluding to a recent lawsuit. It was\r\nat the close of a friendly evening in a very old mansion in the Rue de\r\nGrenelle, and each of the guests had a story to tell, which he assured\r\nus was true.\r\n\r\nThen the old Marquis de la Tour-Samuel, eighty-two years of age, rose\r\nand came forward to lean on the mantelpiece. He told the following story\r\nin his slightly quavering voice.\r\n\r\n\"I, also, have witnessed a strange thing--so strange that it has been\r\nthe nightmare of my life. It happened fifty-six years ago, and yet there\r\nis not a month when I do not see it again in my dreams. From that day I\r\nhave borne a mark, a stamp of fear,--do you understand?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for ten minutes I was a prey to terror, in such a way that ever\r\nsince a constant dread has remained in my soul. Unexpected sounds chill\r\nme to the heart; objects which I can ill distinguish in the evening\r\nshadows make me long to flee. I am afraid at night.\r\n\r\n\"No! I would not have owned such a thing before reaching my present\r\nage. But now I may tell everything. One may fear imaginary dangers at\r\neighty-two years old. But before actual danger I have never turned back,\r\n_mesdames_.\r\n\r\n\"That affair so upset my mind, filled me with such a deep, mysterious\r\nunrest that I never could tell it. I kept it in that inmost part, that\r\ncorner where we conceal our sad, our shameful secrets, all the\r\nweaknesses of our life which cannot be confessed.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you that strange happening just as it took place, with no\r\nattempt to explain it. Unless I went mad for one short hour it must be\r\nexplainable, though. Yet I was not mad, and I will prove it to you.\r\nImagine what you will. Here are the simple facts:\r\n\r\n\"It was in 1827, in July. I was quartered with my regiment in Rouen.\r\n\r\n\"One day, as I was strolling on the quay, I came across a man I believed\r\nI recognized, though I could not place him with certainty. I\r\ninstinctively went more slowly, ready to pause. The stranger saw my\r\nimpulse, looked at me, and fell into my arms.\r\n\r\n\"It was a friend of my younger days, of whom I had been very fond. He\r\nseemed to have become half a century older in the five years since I had\r\nseen him. His hair was white, and he stooped in his walk, as if he were\r\nexhausted. He understood my amazement and told me the story of his life.\r\n\r\n\"A terrible event had broken him down. He had fallen madly in love with\r\na young girl and married her in a kind of dreamlike ecstasy. After a\r\nyear of unalloyed bliss and unexhausted passion, she had died suddenly\r\nof heart disease, no doubt killed by love itself.\r\n\r\n\"He had left the country on the very day of her funeral, and had come to\r\nlive in his hotel at Rouen. He remained there, solitary and desperate,\r\ngrief slowly mining him, so wretched that he constantly thought of\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\"'As I thus came across you again,' he said, 'I shall ask a great favor\r\nof you. I want you to go to my château and get some papers I urgently\r\nneed. They are in the writing-desk of my room, of _our_ room. I cannot\r\nsend a servant or a lawyer, as the errand must be kept private. I want\r\nabsolute silence.\r\n\r\n\"'I shall give you the key of the room, which I locked carefully myself\r\nbefore leaving, and the key to the writing-desk. I shall also give you a\r\nnote for the gardener, who will let you in.\r\n\r\n\"'Come to breakfast with me to-morrow, and we'll talk the matter over.'\r\n\r\n\"I promised to render him that slight service. It would mean but a\r\npleasant excursion for me, his home not being more than twenty-five\r\nmiles from Rouen. I could go there in an hour on horseback.\r\n\r\n\"At ten o'clock the next day I was with him. We breakfasted alone\r\ntogether, yet he did not utter more than twenty words. He asked me to\r\nexcuse him. The thought that I was going to visit the room where his\r\nhappiness lay shattered, upset him, he said. Indeed, he seemed\r\nperturbed, worried, as if some mysterious struggle were taking place in\r\nhis soul.\r\n\r\n\"At last he explained exactly what I was to do. It was very simple. I\r\nwas to take two packages of letters and some papers, locked in the first\r\ndrawer at the right of the desk of which I had the key. He added:\r\n\r\n\"'I need not ask you not to glance at them.'\r\n\r\n\"I was almost hurt by his words, and told him so, rather sharply. He\r\nstammered:\r\n\r\n\"'Forgive me. I suffer so much!'\r\n\r\n\"And tears came to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I left about one o'clock to accomplish my errand.\r\n\r\n\"The day was radiant, and I rushed through the meadows, listening to the\r\nsong of the larks, and the rhythmical beat of my sword on my\r\nriding-boots.\r\n\r\n\"Then I entered the forest, and I set my horse to walking. Branches of\r\nthe trees softly caressed my face, and now and then I would catch a leaf\r\nbetween my teeth and bite it with avidity, full of the joy of life, such\r\nas fills you without reason, with a tumultuous happiness almost\r\nindefinable, a kind of magical strength.\r\n\r\n\"As I neared the house I took out the letter for the gardener, and noted\r\nwith surprise that it was sealed. I was so amazed and so annoyed that I\r\nalmost turned back without fulfilling my mission. Then I thought that I\r\nshould thus display over-sensitiveness and bad taste. My friend might\r\nhave sealed it unconsciously, worried as he was.\r\n\r\n\"The manor looked as though it had been deserted the last twenty years.\r\nThe gate, wide-open and rotten, held, one wondered how. Grass filled the\r\npaths; you could not tell the flower-beds from the lawn.\r\n\r\n\"At the noise I made kicking a shutter, an old man came out from a\r\nside-door and was apparently amazed to see me there. I dismounted from\r\nmy horse and gave him the letter. He read it once or twice, turned it\r\nover, looked at me with suspicion, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"'Well, what do you want?'\r\n\r\n\"I answered sharply:\r\n\r\n\"'You must know it as you have read your master's orders. I want to get\r\nin the house.'\r\n\r\n\"He appeared overwhelmed. He said:\r\n\r\n\"'So--you are going in--in his room?'\r\n\r\n\"I was getting impatient.\r\n\r\n\"'_Parbleu!_ Do you intend to question me, by chance?'\r\n\r\n\"He stammered:\r\n\r\n\"'No--monsieur--only--it has not been opened since--since the death. If\r\nyou will wait five minutes, I will go in to see whether----'\r\n\r\n\"I interrupted angrily:\r\n\r\n\"'See here, are you joking? You can't go in that room, as I have the\r\nkey!'\r\n\r\n\"He no longer knew what to say.\r\n\r\n\"'Then, monsieur, I will show you the way.'\r\n\r\n\"'Show me the stairs and leave me alone. I can find it without your\r\nhelp.'\r\n\r\n\"'But--still--monsieur----'\r\n\r\n\"Then I lost my temper.\r\n\r\n\"'Now be quiet! Else you'll be sorry!'\r\n\r\n\"I roughly pushed him aside and went into the house.\r\n\r\n\"I first went through the kitchen, then crossed two small rooms occupied\r\nby the man and his wife. From there I stepped into a large hall. I went\r\nup the stairs, and I recognized the door my friend had described to me.\r\n\r\n\"I opened it with ease and went in.\r\n\r\n\"The room was so dark that at first I could not distinguish anything. I\r\npaused, arrested by that moldy and stale odor peculiar to deserted and\r\ncondemned rooms, of dead rooms. Then gradually my eyes grew accustomed\r\nto the gloom, and I saw rather clearly a great room in disorder, a bed\r\nwithout sheets having still its mattresses and pillows, one of which\r\nbore the deep print of an elbow or a head, as if someone had just been\r\nresting on it.\r\n\r\n\"The chairs seemed all in confusion. I noticed that a door, probably\r\nthat of a closet, had remained ajar.\r\n\r\n\"I first went to the window and opened it to get some light, but the\r\nhinges of the outside shutters were so rusted that I could not loosen\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I even tried to break them with my sword, but did not succeed. As those\r\nfruitless attempts irritated me, and as my eyes were by now adjusted to\r\nthe dim light, I gave up hope of getting more light and went toward the\r\nwriting-desk.\r\n\r\n\"I sat down in an arm-chair, folded back the top, and opened the drawer.\r\nIt was full to the edge. I needed but three packages, which I knew how\r\nto distinguish, and I started looking for them.\r\n\r\n\"I was straining my eyes to decipher the inscriptions, when I thought I\r\nheard, or rather felt a rustle behind me. I took no notice, thinking a\r\ndraft had lifted some curtain. But a minute later, another movement,\r\nalmost indistinct, sent a disagreeable little shiver over my skin. It\r\nwas so ridiculous to be moved thus even so slightly, that I would not\r\nturn round, being ashamed. I had just discovered the second package I\r\nneeded, and was on the point of reaching for the third, when a great and\r\nsorrowful sigh, close to my shoulder, made me give a mad leap two yards\r\naway. In my spring I had turned round, my hand on the hilt of my sword,\r\nand surely had I not felt that, I should have fled like a coward.\r\n\r\n\"A tall woman, dressed in white, was facing me, standing behind the\r\nchair in which I had sat a second before.\r\n\r\n\"Such a shudder ran through me that I almost fell back! Oh, no one who\r\nhas not felt them can understand those gruesome and ridiculous terrors!\r\nThe soul melts; your heart seems to stop; your whole body becomes limp\r\nas a sponge, and your innermost parts seem collapsing.\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe in ghosts; and yet I broke down before the hideous\r\nfear of the dead; and I suffered, oh, I suffered more in a few minutes,\r\nin the irresistible anguish of supernatural dread, than I have suffered\r\nin all the rest of my life!\r\n\r\n\"If she had not spoken, I might have died. But she did speak; she spoke\r\nin a soft and plaintive voice which set my nerves vibrating. I could not\r\nsay that I regained my self-control. No, I was past knowing what I did;\r\nbut the kind of pride I have in me, as well as a military pride, helped\r\nme to maintain, almost in spite of myself, an honorable countenance. I\r\nwas making a pose, a pose for myself, and for her, for her, whatever she\r\nwas, woman, or phantom. I realized this later, for at the time of the\r\napparition, I could think of nothing. I was afraid.\r\n\r\n\"She said:\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, you can be of great help to me, monsieur!'\r\n\r\n\"I tried to answer, but I was unable to utter one word. A vague sound\r\ncame from my throat.\r\n\r\n\"She continued:\r\n\r\n\"'Will you? You can save me, cure me. I suffer terribly. I always\r\nsuffer. I suffer, oh, I suffer!'\r\n\r\n\"And she sat down gently in my chair. She looked at me.\r\n\r\n\"'Will you?'\r\n\r\n\"I nodded my head, being still paralyzed.\r\n\r\n\"Then she handed me a woman's comb of tortoise-shell, and murmured:\r\n\r\n\"'Comb my hair! Oh, comb my hair! That will cure me. Look at my\r\nhead--how I suffer! And my hair--how it hurts!'\r\n\r\n\"Her loose hair, very long, very black, it seemed to me, hung over the\r\nback of the chair, touching the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Why did I do it? Why did I, shivering, accept that comb, and why did I\r\ntake between my hands her long hair, which left on my skin a ghastly\r\nimpression of cold, as if I had handled serpents? I do not know.\r\n\r\n\"That feeling still clings about my fingers, and I shiver when I recall\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"I combed her, I handled, I know not how, that hair of ice. I bound and\r\nunbound it; I plaited it as one plaits a horse's mane. She sighed, bent\r\nher head, seemed happy.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly she said, 'Thank you!' tore the comb from my hands, and fled\r\nthrough the door which I had noticed was half opened.\r\n\r\n\"Left alone, I had for a few seconds the hazy feeling one feels in\r\nwaking up from a nightmare. Then I recovered myself. I ran to the window\r\nand broke the shutters by my furious assault.\r\n\r\n\"A stream of light poured in. I rushed to the door through which that\r\nbeing had gone. I found it locked and immovable.\r\n\r\n\"Then a fever of flight seized on me, a panic, the true panic of battle.\r\nI quickly grasped the three packages of letters from the open desk; I\r\ncrossed the room running, I took the steps of the stairway four at a\r\ntime. I found myself outside, I don't know how, and seeing my horse\r\nclose by, I mounted in one leap and left at a full gallop.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't stop till I reached Rouen and drew up in front of my house.\r\nHaving thrown the reins to my orderly, I flew to my room and locked\r\nmyself in to think.\r\n\r\n\"Then for an hour I asked myself whether I had not been the victim of an\r\nhallucination. Certainly I must have had one of those nervous shocks,\r\none of those brain disorders such as give rise to miracles, to which the\r\nsupernatural owes its strength.\r\n\r\n\"And I had almost concluded that it was a vision, an illusion of my\r\nsenses, when I came near to the window. My eyes by chance looked down.\r\nMy tunic was covered with hairs, long woman's hairs which had entangled\r\nthemselves around the buttons!\r\n\r\n\"I took them off one by one and threw them out of the window with\r\ntrembling fingers.\r\n\r\n\"I then called my orderly. I felt too perturbed, too moved, to go and\r\nsee my friend on that day. Besides, I needed to think over what I should\r\ntell him.\r\n\r\n\"I had his letters delivered to him. He gave a receipt to the soldier.\r\nHe inquired after me and was told that I was not well. I had had a\r\nsunstroke, or something. He seemed distressed.\r\n\r\n\"I went to see him the next day, early in the morning, bent on telling\r\nhim the truth. He had gone out the evening before and had not come\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"I returned the same day, but he had not been seen. I waited a week. He\r\ndid not come back. I notified the police. They searched for him\r\neverywhere, but no one could find any trace of his passing or of his\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\"A careful search was made in the deserted manor. No suspicious clue was\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n\"There was no sign that a woman had been concealed there.\r\n\r\n\"The inquest gave no result, and so the search went no further.\r\n\r\n\"And in fifty-six years I have learned nothing more. I never found out\r\nthe truth.\"",
