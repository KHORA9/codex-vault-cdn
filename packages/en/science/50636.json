With this object the evidence of the medical\r\nand chemical witnesses has been given in detail, especially in those\r\ncases in which a conflict of scientific testimony arose, between\r\nexperts of the highest professional character and reputation. Care has\r\nalso been taken to state the scientific nomenclature of this class of\r\nwitness correctly, a point on which the shorthand writers, otherwise\r\nso reliable, are naturally liable to fail, catching as they do only\r\nthe sounds of a language unknown to them, in reporting which the error\r\neven in a single letter is often most important. My colleague, besides\r\nfurnishing the latest information obtainable with reference to the\r\nvarious poisons, has offered from recent experiments, made specially\r\nfor this purpose, explanations of those points in the several trials\r\nabout which the rival experts disputed, bringing to bear on them the\r\nlatest discoveries in chemical science.\r\n\r\nIn preparing these reports, I have followed the form adopted by the\r\nlate Mr. Townsend, the Recorder of Macclesfield, in his valuable\r\nvolumes of trials—now I believe quite out of print—grouping the\r\nwitnesses under the heads of the case to which their evidence specially\r\napplied, dividing the scientific from the moral testimony, and wherever\r\na conflict arose between the experts called for the prosecution and\r\nthose for the defence, giving the evidence of the latter immediately\r\nafter that of the former, so as to place the points at issue more\r\nclearly before the reader.\r\n\r\nIt would have been impossible, within reasonable limits, to have\r\nreported in detail the elaborate speeches of counsel (most of them\r\nmodels of argument, criticism, and eloquence), or the minute and\r\nexhaustive charges of many of the presiding judges. The abstracts\r\nwhich have been given will, however, serve to perpetuate the most\r\nimportant and notable parts of both. In some of the cases the immediate\r\napplication of these either to certain points in the evidence, or to\r\nthe arguments adduced on either side, has been shown by quotations in\r\nthe notes. With these exceptions, and a few notes pointing out errors\r\nor discrepancies in the evidence, I have generally forborne to express\r\nan opinion on the verdict, preferring to present such reports of the\r\nevidence as may enable the student to form his own conclusions.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of chemical science the field of the poisoner\r\nis constantly extending. New poisons are yearly discovered, each\r\nsucceeding one apparently more difficult of detection than the former.\r\nDeath lurks in many unsuspected forms, and but for the parallel march\r\nof the science of detection, the poisoner would more often escape. A\r\ngrave danger to society, too, lies in the patent medicines, so popular\r\nand so perilous; in the vermin killers, loaded with deadly poison,\r\nwhich can be bought without let or hindrance by any one; and the use\r\nof preparations for animals—not so deleterious to the latter, as they\r\nare death-dealing—if either intentionally or by accident given to a\r\nhuman being. Stringent as the regulations of the Poisons Act appear on\r\npaper, the facility with which Lamson purchased aconitia, merely on the\r\ncredit of his name appearing in the Medical Directory, and the really\r\nunrestricted sale of patent medicines and vermin-killers, mark the\r\npractical inutility of the Act. A new Act, dealing with these points,\r\nhas been promised by the Government, but there seems little probability\r\nof its passing this session.\r\n\r\n  G. L. B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the compilation of these chemical notes it has been found very\r\ndifficult to be sufficiently simple and complete in explanation for\r\nnon-scientific readers, without either sacrificing many important\r\ndetails, or exceeding the limited space available. I have attempted\r\nas far as possible not only to solve the questions that arose in the\r\ntrials, but to look forward to many that might occur in future cases.\r\nNo claim is laid to originality except in a few experiments; but the\r\nsearch through existing authorities has involved so much labour, that I\r\nmust plead a very limited leisure as an excuse for any incompleteness.\r\nIn such portions as touched on medicine I have been guided by the later\r\ntext-books, and by living advice. It has been thought preferable to\r\ngive references in the text, at the very passage quoted, instead of in\r\nfoot-notes.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the proposed new Poisons Act one or two considerations\r\nshould not be forgotten. There are hundreds of ways of taking life: the\r\npoisoner’s is only one. Even in his method the number of fatal agents\r\nhe may use is almost unlimited. To make a schedule of certain poisons\r\nthat are not to be sold without restriction, seems like prohibiting\r\nknives, while allowing stilettos—the latter are certainly less usual,\r\nbut quite as fatal. Moreover, the Act of 1868 only affects one channel\r\nby which poisons may reach the public—viz., through the retail\r\nchemists. It secures a record of ordinary shop purchases, and thus\r\nfacilitates the tracing of crime. But the channels of trade are still\r\nopen: hundred-weights of arsenic are obtained, where ounces could not\r\nbe purchased; and these large stocks are often carelessly kept, and\r\nleft open to servants, workmen, or even children. The result is that\r\nthe supposed restrictions on obtaining poisons are almost illusory:\r\nthese substances are sown broadcast among ignorant people, and are\r\nplaced in cupboards unlabelled among articles of food. The following\r\nare recent illustrations:—\r\n\r\n “At Corkley, Wilts, the wife of a labourer used, instead of\r\n baking-powder, a packet of arsenic, intended by her husband as\r\n medicine for his horses. The husband and wife died.”—_Weekly\r\n Dispatch, May 6, 1883._\r\n\r\n “At Whitchurch, a farmer was accused of poisoning a large number of\r\n cattle and other animals with arsenic. In 1881 he had obtained several\r\n pounds of it from Liverpool, stating that he wanted it to destroy\r\n vermin.”—_Evening Standard, June 2, 1883._\r\n\r\nIn the schedule of the 1868 Act, among the _less dangerous poisons_,\r\nto be obtained without restriction beyond proper labelling, appears,\r\n“Almonds, Essential Oil of (_unless deprived of prussic acid_).” Yet\r\nthis preparation is one of the most perilous, as has been shown by\r\nnumbers of deaths, and lately by the West Malling case (not yet ripe\r\nenough for reporting). There are also other faults in the schedule.\r\n\r\nRemembering, then, that legislation on the sale of poisons is utterly\r\nunable to _prevent_ poisoning, that all it can do is to make the means\r\na little difficult, and the detection more easy, how can we approve\r\nthe proposal at this moment made, to tack on a few, very tentative\r\nclauses to an unsuccessful Act, and four more names to a very defective\r\nschedule? Why insert chloride of antimony, and omit nitrate of silver,\r\nsulphate of copper, and chloride of tin? The essence of a “poison” is\r\n_quantity_; and no Act which does not specify the maximum quantity\r\nthat may be sold, can be effective. Beyond this, why should it be more\r\ncriminal to _sell_ a dangerous substance to a poisoner than to _give_\r\nit to him, or by culpable negligence to allow him to take possession of\r\nit? If such neglect were made punishable, if people who left arsenic,\r\n&c., about in cupboards without precaution, had to suffer for the\r\nconsequences, we should hear less of such “accidents.”\r\n\r\nI am deeply indebted to Dr. Bernays, Professor of Chemistry at St.\r\nThomas’s Hospital, for kind advice and facilities of consultation and\r\nexperiment; to Doctors Harley, Ord, Acland, and to my namesake, Mr.\r\nCharles Stewart, F.L.S., for many valuable suggestions; and especially\r\nto Mr. E. G. Clayton, F.C.S., who contributed the main part of the\r\nchapter on Aconitia, and helped me materially in other portions of the\r\nchemical notes.\r\n\r\nThe main authorities drawn upon have been:—\r\n\r\n  Taylor’s Medical Jurisprudence, 1873.\r\n  Taylor on Poisons.\r\n  Woodman and Tidy’s Handy-Book of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology,\r\n      1877.\r\n  Blyth’s Manual of Practical Chemistry, 1879.\r\n  Guy and Ferrier’s Forensic Medicine, 1881.\r\n  Allen’s Commercial Organic Analysis, 1879.\r\n  Royle’s Materia Medica, edited by Dr. J.

They do not admit, perhaps, of accurate\r\nclassification, but inasmuch as the manner of death and symptoms are\r\nusually the most available indication as to the nature of the poison\r\nthat has acted, the following arrangement will be serviceable. The\r\nheads indicate the most prominent symptom:\r\n\r\nI. SUDDEN DEATH.—Large quantities of any poison might be rapid\r\nin fatal result, but the sudden poisons proper are:—concentrated\r\nsulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acids; poisonous gases and vapours,\r\nsuch as carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen (_see_ Casper’s\r\nForensic Medicine, Case CCXLI.), carbonic oxide, arseniuretted and\r\nantimoniuretted hydrogen, and certain rare organic compounds, as\r\nkakodyl, &c.; strychnia sometimes, oxalic acid in large doses,\r\nchloroform under certain circumstances. But beyond all others, the\r\nquickest of poisons is _hydrocyanic or prussic acid_.\r\n\r\nII. INSENSIBILITY, generally following nervous excitement. Morphia\r\nand opium; henbane (_Hyoscyamus_); stramonium; belladonna; nicotine\r\n(_tobacco_); darnel (_lolium temulentum_); hemlock (_Conium\r\nmaculatum_); water hemlock (_Œnanthe crocata_); fool’s parsley (_Æthusa\r\ncynapium_), [Dr. J. Harley shows that this is not so poisonous\r\nas believed: _see_ St. Thomas’s Hospital Reports, x. 25]; Indian\r\nhemp (_Cannabis indica_); Woody Nightshade (_Solanum dulcamara_);\r\nSolanum nigrum; the berries of Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_); Lobelia\r\ninflata: Foxglove (_Digitalis_); cocculus indicus; certain fungi\r\n(notably _Amanita muscaria_); chloroform; chloral; butylchloral\r\n—“croton chloral”): amylene; methylene dichloride; sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen; carbonic oxide; and many other substances usually classed as\r\n_narcotics_.\r\n\r\nIII. VOMITING.—Irritant poisons, such as acids, alkalies, alkaline\r\nsalts in considerable doses (even common salt has proved fatal: _see_\r\nChristison[1]); most soluble compounds of the heavy metals (especially\r\nantimony, arsenic, zinc, and copper); certain vegetal alkaloids (from\r\ncolchicum, laburnum, yew, savin, ipecacuanha, capsicum, pepper,\r\nergot, many species of Ranunculaceæ, the Hellebores, and some fungi);\r\ncantharides, turpentine, and essential oils, &c. Pain in the digestive\r\norgans, purging, and general inflammation are commonly present. Most of\r\nthe medicinal purgatives will produce sickness and vomiting if given in\r\noverdoses; of course unwholesome food or disease may frequently be the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIV. ACTION ON THE EYE.—Opium and morphia, calabar bean, aconite (?),\r\nand strychnia, _contract_ the pupil: belladonna, henbane, tobacco,\r\nstramonium, digitalis and hemlock, _dilate_ the pupil. The effect is\r\noften temporary, and sometimes is reversed after a time. It is a\r\nvaluable indication in after-experiments on animals.\r\n\r\nV. CONVULSIONS.—Strychnia, brucia, and some fungi: but this symptom\r\nis by no means confined to these, and may even result as tetanus, from\r\ndisease or irritants (_see_ Trial of Palmer). Morphia, in rare cases,\r\nhas also caused it.\r\n\r\nVI. CHRONIC POISONING, prostration and wasting. Antimony, mercury,\r\nand lead in small repeated doses. With the two latter, but more\r\nespecially with lead, there is a _blue line at the edge of the gums_;\r\nconstipation and colic, paralysis and trembling of the limbs. As lead\r\nfrequently occurs as an impurity in food, and also may be absorbed by\r\nthose working with it, these symptoms may be often accidental. Mercury\r\nalso is given, less than of old, it is true, but still systematically\r\nby some, as a regular course in syphilis, &c.: also to children in\r\nteething powders. Antimony has been almost abandoned in medicine, from\r\nits depressant effect. In these cases, motive, amount, and necessity\r\nof dose, and right to administer, must be considered before wilful\r\npoisoning can be proved. The analysis, therefore, must be strictly\r\n_quantitative_, which is fortunately tolerably easy.\r\n\r\nThe above summary is by no means perfect, since there are minor\r\ndifferences in each class, which may sometimes rise into such\r\nprominence as to confuse the classification. But in medical evidence\r\non the individual poisons of which we treat, those physiologically\r\nresembling them in action are always most heard of at the trial, and\r\nquestions are asked whether this or that may not produce the same\r\nsymptoms; and hence it is well to direct attention to the analogues of\r\nour types.\r\n\r\nThe primary idea of an _alkaloid_ is derived from its resemblance to\r\nan _alkali_. Alkaloids are often called also “Organic Bases.” Their\r\nnames terminate in—_ia_ or _ine_.[2] They are more or less alkaline\r\nto test paper, and combine with acids to form salts which are neutral\r\nin reaction and often crystallizable. Only a few of the alkaloids\r\nare liquid and easily volatile, but almost all can be volatilized\r\nby careful heating at definite temperatures, giving in many cases\r\na sublimate of characteristic appearance under the microscope,\r\neither of crystals, globules, or a mere film. In a free state, the\r\nalkaloids are very slightly soluble in water, but soluble in alcohol,\r\nand generally in ether and chloroform. Some are soluble in benzine,\r\nothers in amylic alcohol, petroleum spirit, acetic ether, &c. On a\r\njudicious use of these various solvents depend the different processes\r\nof isolation, among which Dragendorff’s is the most complete, but so\r\ncomplicated that it is rarely used in its entirety. Fortunately there\r\nis generally a clue more or less definite to the probable poison\r\nadministered, enabling a shorter and quicker method to be adopted. For\r\nfurther details as to these processes see Blyth’s Manual of Practical\r\nChemistry. The sulphates, chlorides, and acetates of the alkaloids\r\nare generally soluble in water; if ammonia or potash be added to the\r\nsolution, a precipitate (usually crystalline) of the free alkaloid\r\noccurs if the solution be of moderate strength.\r\n\r\nChemically, the alkaloids are derived from ammonia (NH_{3}) by\r\nsubstituting various organic groups or “compound radicles” (compounds\r\nof carbon and hydrogen), for the hydrogen of the ammonia. They are\r\ntherefore “compound ammonias,” or “amines.” Nitrogen, carbon, and\r\nhydrogen, are always present in natural alkaloids, the non-volatile\r\nones, including the greater number, also contain oxygen.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically, alkaloids as a class have a powerful action on\r\nthe human and animal frame. The medicinal properties of plants are\r\ngenerally due to these substances, though many are still undiscovered\r\nor imperfectly known. They exist in the plant combined with vegetal\r\nacids, some of which are characteristic, as aconitic acid in aconite,\r\nmeconic in opium, igasuric (?) in nux vomica, &c. The very small\r\nquantity which may sometimes be fatal (a fraction of a grain of the\r\npure alkaloid), the indefiniteness of many of their chemical reactions,\r\nand the facility with which they decompose if too high a heat, or too\r\nstrong reagents, be employed in their extraction, render the detection\r\noften a difficult, and sometimes an impossible matter. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, fresh tests and better processes develop from every case, and\r\nother indications, from symptoms and collateral circumstances, rarely\r\nfail to bring home the guilt even to the most ingenious and scientific\r\nof poisoners.\r\n\r\nFor extracting the alkaloids from animal matters the following process\r\nhas been used by the author. Mince finely, digest with rectified spirit\r\nand enough acetic acid to _just acidify_, warm to blood-heat for 15\r\nminutes, filter: this is the first extract. Warm the insoluble matters\r\nwith more alcohol and filter again: this is the second extract. Repeat\r\nthe extraction a third time. _Keep the three extracts separate._ Each\r\nshould be evaporated at as low a temperature as possible, not exceeding\r\n50° C., and preferably in a vacuum at the ordinary temperature, if this\r\ncan be done fairly quickly. The syrupy residues must be treated with\r\nwater and a drop of acetic acid, passed through wet filters to separate\r\nfat, rendered just alkaline with ammonia, and shaken with a moderate\r\nquantity of a mixture of equal volumes of ether and chloroform (Allen).\r\nBy a stoppered funnel or burette the ethereal layer is separated,\r\nthe shaking with ether and chloroform and the separation repeated a\r\nsecond and a third time, the ethereal extracts mixed, transferred to\r\na large porcelain dish, and evaporated, first in a current of air,\r\nthen in a vacuum or spontaneously. As the solvents evaporate, water\r\ngenerally appears: this hinders any crystallization. Therefore the\r\nresidue must be rendered _dry_, then dissolved in a little _anhydrous_\r\nchloroform (dried by standing over fused calcium chloride), and again\r\nevaporated in air in a large watch glass. The residue will generally be\r\ncrystalline under the microscope if any alkaloid be present. Dissolve\r\nagain in chloroform, transfer to a graduated burette, make up to a\r\nconvenient volume (say 10 cubic centimetres), and transfer a measured\r\nfraction to a number of watch glasses, reserving about one-fourth for\r\nany subsequent _quantitative_ test that may be necessary. Allow the\r\nliquid in the watch glasses to spontaneously evaporate. To the first\r\nadd a little water and a very minute quantity of dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid, and cautiously taste a portion. A tingling of the lips and\r\nsubsequent numbness indicate _aconite_; intense bitterness points\r\nto _strychnia_; if there be no taste at all it is unlikely that any\r\nalkaloid is present. There are some alkaloids of a peppery taste; these\r\nare irritants, and are not common as poisons. Bitterness is the most\r\nfrequent characteristic.\r\n\r\n2. Moisten the contents of the second watch glass with a little water\r\nand a trace of acetic acid, and apply through an incision in the\r\nskin of the back of a young frog. He should be kept as comfortable\r\nas possible and the symptoms observed. Strychnia readily produces\r\ntetanus in this animal; other poisons also have peculiar effects. Some\r\nobservers have used mice, rabbits, or cats; in the Palmer trial it was\r\nobserved that dogs were not employed because they were inconvenient\r\nand might bite! On the whole this so-called physiological test has\r\nbeen overrated, as it is hardly to be expected that an animal with its\r\nback cut and otherwise injured will not exhibit some symptoms; and\r\nall who have kept wild animals in confinement will know how soon they\r\nbecome, first almost convulsive from excitement, then finally sink into\r\nstupor and die. If necessary, any judge may grant a special licence to\r\nthe experts in a trial to make experiments on animals, otherwise such\r\ncruelty is rendered penal by the Vivisection Act.[3]\r\n\r\n3. To the third watch glass, after the contents have been dissolved\r\nas before, a drop of a solution of iodine in potassium iodide is\r\nadded. Nearly all alkaloids give a brown precipitate. If none occur, a\r\nnegative conclusion may be expected.\r\n\r\n4. Test the fourth watch glass in one corner for strychnia by\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid and peroxide of manganese; in another\r\ncorner for morphia by iodic acid and starch; in a third corner for\r\nbrucia (and morphia) by strong nitric acid. (See the special paragraphs\r\non these reactions, pp. 280, 285.)\r\n\r\n5. If there is still no indication, and no information has\r\nbeen obtained from other sources, it may be necessary to employ\r\nDragendorff’s process on the remainder. But if the poison has been\r\ndiscovered, the solution reserved in the burette should be evaporated,\r\ndissolved in water and a little dilute acid, avoiding heat, and\r\ntitrated by Mayer’s reagent to ascertain the quantity.[4]\r\n\r\nThe second and third extractions of the organs must now be considered.\r\nMost of the text-books recommend that _all the extracts should be\r\nmixed_. The objection to this is, that since the alkaloid is usually\r\npresent in very small amount, the first extraction will remove nearly\r\nall of it, while the second and third will mainly contain other\r\nmatters, and therefore will be only adding to the impurities, and\r\nconsequently to the difficulty of isolation. If it be worth while, the\r\nsecond and third extracts may be treated _separately_ as above, and\r\nshould any further quantity of alkaloid be found, it may be determined\r\nquantitatively, and the amount added to that already obtained.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to precipitate the original spirituous extract by\r\nneutral or basic acetate of lead, which throws down many impurities,\r\nbut leaves the alkaloids in solution. After filtration, the liquid\r\nis treated with a current of sulphuretted hydrogen to remove lead;\r\nagain filtered, evaporated (as speedily as can be done without\r\noverheating) to a moderate bulk, and treated with a little ammonia\r\nand with ether-chloroform as before. If the sulphuretted hydrogen be\r\nleft exposed to the air for some time, it oxidizes to sulphuric acid,\r\nwhich, during and after evaporation, tends to destroy the alkaloid.\r\nHence I have found it advisable to remove the H_{2}S quickly by a\r\ncurrent of carbonic acid and warming—previous to evaporation. But\r\nthis process is not good for alkaloids, as sulphur compounds are often\r\nformed, which interfere with subsequent operations.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing process may fail to extract _morphia_, _curarine_, and\r\n_solanine_, as these, being very little soluble in ether-chloroform,\r\nmay remain behind in the aqueous liquid. This, therefore, should be\r\nafterwards treated in one of the following ways:—\r\n\r\n1. Heat some redistilled amylic alcohol nearly to boiling (it boils\r\nat 120° C.), add an equal volume to the aqueous (alkaline) solution;\r\nshake vigorously, separate while still hot, and shake again with a\r\nfresh, but rather smaller, quantity of the hot solvent. The united\r\namylic alcohol solutions will contain all the morphia, but can only be\r\ndistilled in vacuo, since at 120° C. the stability of the morphia would\r\nbe endangered. It is better to extract the morphia from the amylic\r\nsolution by shaking with successive small portions of weak acetic acid,\r\nseparating each time, till the acidity remains unneutralized. The\r\nalkaloid will now be in the acid solution. Nearly neutralize this with\r\nammonia, evaporate at a gentle heat, and apply the special tests.\r\n\r\n2. Instead of the above, the aqueous alkaline solution may be agitated\r\nwith a mixture of equal volumes of ether and _pure_ acetic ether (the\r\nlatter having been previously purified from free acid by standing over\r\npowdered carbonate of lime). Although this mixture does not extract the\r\nmorphia so readily as amylic alcohol, it has this advantage that, after\r\nseparation from the aqueous layer, it can be evaporated at a moderate\r\ntemperature, when the morphia, if in sufficient quantity, will be left\r\nin the crystalline state, and can be tested as usual.\r\n\r\nIf sufficient material be at hand, of course both processes may be\r\nused.[5]\r\n\r\nSelmi (Gazz. Chim. Ital. vi., 32) has given a process for alkaloidal\r\nextraction of which I have no experience.\r\n\r\nWhen the alkaloid is obtained in a sufficiently pure form and in\r\nsufficient quantity, the sublimation process of Dr. Guy, as improved\r\nby Blyth, may be used. For the entire original method, see Blyth’s\r\nPractical Chemistry, page 285.\r\n\r\nDr. Guy’s “subliming cell” is a ring of glass tubing about ⅛-inch long\r\nand ⅓ to ½-inch diameter, ground true and smooth at top and bottom,\r\nresting on a circle of thin microscope glass, and covered with another\r\nsimilar circle. The alkaloid, thoroughly dry, is placed on the lower\r\ndisc (a drop of the solution may be evaporated on it), the whole fitted\r\ntogether, and floated on mercury, or better, fusible metal, contained\r\nin a small glass beaker nearly full, supported on wire gauze over a\r\nsmall flame. A thermometer held by a clamp dips in the liquid metal.\r\nWith a hand lens of as high power as possible, the melting point, and\r\nalso the point when the first sublimate occurs on the upper glass, may\r\nbe observed. As soon as the sublimate has become sufficiently distinct,\r\nthe upper disc is removed, replaced by another, and examined under\r\n¼-inch power of the microscope. The heat is slowly raised till charring\r\noccurs, and anything characteristic noted.\r\n\r\n_Morphia_ gives a clouding, consisting of minute dots, at 150° C.; from\r\n188° to 200° C., distinct crystals are obtained; then it commences to\r\nbrown, melt, and carbonize.\r\n\r\n_Strychnia_ gives a minute sublimate of fine needles at 169° C., and\r\nmelts at about 221° C.\r\n\r\n_Brucia_ melts at 151° C., browns easily, but gives no true sublimate.\r\n\r\n_Aconitine_ or aconitia melts at 183° to 184° C.\r\n\r\n_Pseudaconitine_ melts at 104° to 105° C., and easily decomposes,\r\ngiving off water.\r\n\r\n_Commercial aconitine_ usually melts below 100° C., and gives an\r\namorphous sublimate above 150° C.\r\n\r\nThe reactions of the other alkaloids will be found in Blyth’s Practical\r\nChemistry.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid repetition, the mode of preparing the general\r\nreagents for alkaloids will be given here.\r\n\r\n1. _Mayers Reagent_, potassio-iodide of mercury, already described (p.\r\n7; Liebig’s Annalen, 133, 286), gives white precipitates with almost\r\nall alkaloids. The latter can be recovered from the precipitate by\r\ntreating it with a solution of zinc chloride mixed with caustic soda.\r\n(Mayer.)\r\n\r\n2. _Potassium tri-iodide_, a solution of iodine in potassium iodide,\r\ngives a brown or reddish precipitate.[6]\r\n\r\n3. _Sonnenschein’s test_, Phosphomolybdic acid, is prepared as follows.\r\nTo a warm solution of molybdate of ammonia acidified with nitric\r\nacid, phosphate of soda is added as long as any yellow precipitate is\r\nobtained. The precipitate is washed with water containing a little\r\nnitric acid, and heated with sodium carbonate solution till dissolved.\r\nEvaporate to dryness, heat to expel ammonia, add a little nitric\r\nacid and heat again. One part of the residue is then dissolved in a\r\nmixture of one part of nitric acid of 1·4 sp. gr., and nine parts of\r\nwater. With this reagent _strychnia_ gives a pale, other _alkaloids_\r\na bright yellow flocculent precipitate, in very dilute solutions. The\r\nprecipitates are soluble in ammonia, with the production of a greenish\r\nblue colour in the cases of aconitia and morphia. From the alkaline\r\nliquid the _alkaloid_ can be dissolved out by at once shaking with\r\nether-chloroform or hot amylic alcohol as already described. Instead of\r\nusing ammonia, the precipitate may be agitated with barium carbonate,\r\nwhich has less tendency to decompose the base on its liberation.\r\n\r\n4. A solution of _bismuth iodide_ in iodide of potassium is recommended\r\nby Dragendorff (Zeitschr. f. Chimie, 1866, 478). 80 grammes of\r\ncommercial bismuth subnitrate are dissolved in 200 cubic centimetres\r\nof nitric acid of sp. gr. 1·18: 272 grammes of potassium iodide\r\ndissolved in a little water are added, the potassium nitrate allowed\r\nto crystallize out, and the whole diluted to one litre. This solution\r\nprecipitates most alkaloids. The precipitate can be treated with sodium\r\ncarbonate and the liberated alkaloid extracted by ether-chloroform, &c.\r\nFor the equivalents, see Maugini, Gazz. Chim. Ital. 12, 155.\r\n\r\n5. Scheibler has proposed _Phosphotungstic acid_ as a precipitant.\r\nSodium tungstate is digested with half its weight of phosphoric\r\nacid, sp. gr. 1·13: on standing, phosphotungstic acid crystallizes.\r\nIts solution is said to give a distinct precipitate with 1/200000\r\nof a grain of strychnia and 1/100000 of quina, and with similar\r\namounts of other alkaloids. From this precipitate the alkaloid is\r\nobtained by treating with sufficient milk of lime and shaking with\r\nether-chloroform, &c., as before. He recommends the previous removal\r\nof impurities by lead acetate and sulphuretted hydrogen as already\r\ndescribed (p. 7) (Fresenius, Zeitschr. f. anal. Chemie, 12, 315).\r\n\r\n6. _Picric acid_, a saturated aqueous solution, gives precipitates in\r\n_neutral_ solutions of morphia and atropia. In solutions acidified with\r\nsulphuric acid it gives the following:—morphia, and pseudomorphia, no\r\nprecipitate; aconitia, a precipitate only in concentrated solutions;\r\nother alkaloids of opium, a thick precipitate.[7]\r\n\r\n7. _Animal charcoal_, previously purified by hydrochloric acid and\r\nthorough washing with water, when digested with neutral or alkaline\r\nsolutions of alkaloids, not too dilute, absorbs them from the liquid.\r\nThe charcoal, washed twice or thrice with small quantities of water,\r\nis dried at a moderate temperature, and boiled with strong alcohol,\r\nwhich extracts the alkaloid. This process has been used for separating\r\npicrotoxin from beer, but has the inconvenience that the alkaloid is\r\nliable to gradual oxidation within the pores of the charcoal, and that\r\nthe separation is never complete. It is this property that has caused\r\ncharcoal to be recommended as an antidote in poisoning.\r\n\r\n8. All alkaloids form with _platinic chloride_ double salts of more or\r\nless sparing solubility. These precipitates, washed, dried and weighed,\r\nand then burnt, leave metallic platinum, the amount of which yields\r\na clue to the composition of the base. But aconitine and narcotine\r\nare only thrown down from concentrated solutions, and a few are not\r\nprecipitated at all. Hence this test is of only occasional value in\r\ntoxicological work. The same may be said of _auric chloride_.\r\n\r\n9. _Tannin_ or tannic acid, a moderately strong solution in water,\r\nthrows down most alkaloids. Coffee and tea, and other tannin-containing\r\ninfusions, have, therefore, been used as antidotes with dubious\r\nsuccess. As a test it is not distinctive.\r\n\r\n10. _Phospho-antimonic acid_ (Schultze), prepared by mixing antimony\r\npentachloride with ordinary sodium phosphate and decanting the clear\r\nliquid, gives whitish amorphous precipitates with alkaloids.\r\n\r\n11. _Silico-tungstic acid_ is prepared by boiling commercial tungstate\r\nof soda with fresh gelatinous silica. Filter and allow to crystallize.\r\nThis gives precipitates with very dilute solutions of alkaloids, but it\r\nis also precipitated by ammonium chloride (Godefroy, Arch. d. Pharm.,\r\nNov. 1879). Zaubenheimer recommends it as a most delicate test: the\r\nprecipitate may be decomposed by soda or potash, and the base extracted\r\nby ether-chloroform.\r\n\r\n12. Auric chloride, palladious chloride, and mercuric chloride have\r\nbeen proposed, but are not of much use. Potassium chromate and\r\nsulphocyanide, and sodium nitroprusside give somewhat insoluble\r\nprecipitates, generally crystalline and of characteristic appearance\r\nunder the microscope. These tests should be strong, and must be used in\r\nsmall quantity.\r\n\r\nPTOMAINES OR CADAVERIC ALKALOIDS.—Much attention has been attracted\r\nlately by the possible interference to toxicological detections owing\r\nto the undoubted existence of natural alkaloids in the dead body\r\nunpoisoned. Some of these, called by Selmi “Ptomaines” ([Greek: ptôma],\r\na corpse), somewhat simulate strychnia, &c., in their chemical and\r\nphysiological characters. The observation is not new, as years ago, in\r\nthe Privy Council’s reports, Thudichum called attention to alkaloids\r\nseparated by Sonnenschein’s process (phosphomolybdic acid) from the\r\nbrain, urine, and from decomposed bodies. Various substances of the\r\nkind have also been found by other investigators. To these “cadaveric\r\nalkaloids” have been attributed the “sausage poisoning,” so frequent\r\nin Germany (for cases, see Casper’s Handbook, vol. 3), poisoning by\r\nvarious foods, such as tinned meats, cheese, &c. Some are irritants,\r\nothers narcotics: different periods and circumstances of putrefaction\r\nproducing different compounds.\r\n\r\nIn an Italian criminal prosecution, F. Ciotto, who made the\r\ninvestigation of the corpse, gave it as his opinion that strychnia was\r\nprobably present. Selmi, for the defence, pointed out differences from\r\nstrychnia, and considered the compound to be a ptomaine. [Arch. Pharm.\r\n(3), 19, 187.] This will show the importance of the subject.\r\n\r\nCasali (Gazetta, 1881, 312) regards ptomaines as not true alkaloids,\r\nbut as “acid or basic amidated compounds.” It is only the basic ones\r\nthat will interfere with testing. Panum and Bergmann have isolated a\r\nsubstance called “_sepsin_,” generated by putrefaction, poisonous,\r\nacting like a ferment but not destroyed by boiling, soluble in water,\r\nbut insoluble in alcohol, and thereby distinguished from alkaloids.\r\nSonnenschein and Zuelzer found a product of putrefaction which\r\nproduced tetanic symptoms, besides one resembling atropine. But these\r\nsubstances, or similar ones, can be produced _without_ putrefaction, as\r\nPaterno and Spica have shown that fresh blood and fresh albumen (white\r\nof egg) yielded, with phosphomolybdic acid, potassio-mercuric iodide,\r\nand other alkaloidal reagents, precipitates like those of the vegetal\r\nalkaloids. Selmi has even supposed that death from various diseases may\r\nbe due to the formation of these compounds. The same author obtained\r\nfrom a dead body one month after death a considerable amount of a\r\n_crystallizable_ ptomaine, giving reactions like those of alkaloidal\r\npoisons, and having poisonous effects on frogs.\r\n\r\nBrouardel and Bouting (Compt. Rend. 92, 1056) propose the reducing\r\naction of ptomaines as a distinction between them and vegetal\r\nalkaloids. The solution in weak acid is added to a dilute mixture of\r\nferric chloride and potassium ferricyanide: the latter, if a ptomaine\r\nbe present, is reduced to ferrocyanide, and Prussian blue is thereby\r\nprecipitated. But Spica (Gazetta, 11, 486) has shown that strychnia,\r\nbrucia, morphia, and some others produce this reaction readily, and\r\nBeckurts (Arch. Pharm. 3, 20, 104) adds aconitine and others as\r\nproducing it slowly. Hence the distinction is delusive. See also\r\nHusemann (Arch. Pharm. 3, 16, 169; also 3, 20, 270), Tauret (Compt.\r\nRend. 92, 1163).\r\n\r\nThe discovery of these bodies has certainly raised a new difficulty for\r\ntoxicologists, and suggested a new and plausible defence, as it must be\r\nconfessed that at present there is no general method of distinguishing\r\nbetween “cadaveric” and vegetal alkaloids. Yet this mainly affects\r\nthe “physiological” tests—on frogs and other small animals—for\r\nthere is no ptomaine yet discovered which gives _all_ the reactions\r\nof strychnia, morphia, &c. If a chemist be asked, “Could any other\r\nsubstance produce these reactions?” he can only answer, “I do not know\r\nof any”; he cannot aver the impossibility. Then the circumstantial\r\nevidence must decide.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the following principles should be noted:—\r\n\r\n1. The quantity of poison found is generally only a small fraction\r\nof the quantity taken. The vomit and evacuations are frequently\r\nlost, and much may be decomposed by vital actions in the body, or by\r\nputrefaction. That which has caused death is probably thereby either\r\ndecomposed or so combined as to be rendered undetectible: that which is\r\nfound is merely the surplus beyond the fatal dose. This would account\r\nfor the frequent non-discovery in the tissues when a small amount has\r\nbeen given, or much time has elapsed. To metallic poisons this does not\r\napply, as, unless eliminated, they can always be found. See further\r\nunder Strychnia.\r\n\r\n2. The symptoms will differ according to the dose, the form (solid\r\nor solution, pure or admixed), habit, or idiosyncrasy, the state of\r\nhealth, &c.\r\n\r\n3. In the post-mortem examination, appearances common to dead bodies\r\ngenerally are often mistaken for the effects of poison. See Casper’s\r\nHandbook, vol. I., _et passim_.\r\n\r\n4. Unhealthy or improper food or acute disease may cause suspicious\r\nsymptoms. This is the commonest solution of suspected poisoning.\r\n\r\n5. In experiments on animals, it may be objected that they are\r\ninconclusive as to man. This is not strictly true. But if a _recent\r\nvomit_ proves poisonous to an animal, _with the same symptoms as in the\r\nman_, that is almost conclusive evidence.\r\n\r\n6. When a poison is not found by analysis, it does not follow that\r\nit has not caused death. Unequal distribution, uncertainty of tests,\r\nimproper securing of the samples (Palmer case), decomposition or\r\nelimination of the poison, may hinder discovery.\r\n\r\n7. In every case, if possible, the approximate _quantity_ of the poison\r\nshould be ascertained and stated. This specially applies to substances\r\nthat _may_ have been administered medicinally.\r\n\r\n“If poison be administered _with intent to murder_, it is not necessary\r\nthat there should be enough in the article administered to cause death,\r\nor that it should be given in such a way as to act fatally. If any\r\npoison be there, and the intent be proved, the crime of attempting to\r\nadminister poison is complete.” [Judge’s ruling in _Hartley_, Cent.\r\nCrim. Court, May 12th, 1850; _Reg._ v. _Bacon_, Lincoln Summer Assizes,\r\n1857; _Reg._ v. _Southgate_, Chelmsford Lent Assizes; _Reg._ v.\r\n_Cluderay_, York, 1849].\r\n\r\nFor minute directions as to the conduct of toxicological\r\ninvestigations, see Taylor’s Medical Jurisprudence, 1873, I., 202-209;\r\nalso Guy and Ferrier’s Forensic Medicine, 1881, p. 359, _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTRIALS FOR POISONING BY HYDROCYANIC OR PRUSSIC ACID.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo cases are reported under this head. The first that of John Tawell,\r\nfor the murder of his mistress, Sarah Hart, at Salthill, near Windsor,\r\ntried at the Spring Assizes at Aylesbury, 1845, before the late Baron\r\nParke (Lord Wensleydale). The second—a case of misadventure—the\r\ntrial of George Ball, a surgeon, at Lewes, for the murder of his\r\nmother by the negligent administration of an overdose of this poison,\r\nmedicinally, before the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas\r\n(Coleridge) Summer Assizes, Lewes, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF JOHN TAWELL FOR POISONING SARAH HART AT SALTHILL BY PRUSSIC\r\nACID.\r\n\r\n_March 12, 13, and 14_, 1845, SPRING ASSIZES, AYLESBURY, _before_ BARON\r\nPARKE.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\nThe trial of John Tawell, of Berkhampstead, Berks, for the murder of\r\nSarah Hart, at Hall Place, Slough, attracted more than usual attention,\r\nfrom the cruelty of the act in poisoning the woman whom he had seduced,\r\nthe position and popular character of the murderer as a benevolent and\r\nhospitable Quaker, noted for his charities, and the novelty of the\r\nmode by which his detection was mainly insured. The electric telegraph\r\nhad only very lately been established on the line of the Great Western\r\nRailway, and though Tawell lost no time after committing the act, in\r\ngetting into the train for London at Slough, the telegraph outstripped\r\nhim, and on his arrival at the Paddington station he was recognised,\r\nand tracked to his lodgings, and thus his immediate arrest secured.\r\n\r\nTawell’s life had been of a remarkable character. Originally a\r\ncommercial traveller, he had exhibited a strange mixture of great\r\nshrewdness and money-making talent, combined with an outward show of\r\nreligious observance. As a young man he had been indicted for forging\r\na bill for £1000, and had he been tried on the counts for forging, or\r\nuttering, he would doubtless have been executed. By some influence,\r\nhowever, he was allowed to plead guilty to the count for having the\r\nbill in his possession (a _nolle prosequi_ being entered on the\r\nothers), and sentenced to transportation for life. “Accordingly,”\r\nsays Mr. Justice Therry, who knew him well in Sydney, “he came out\r\nto the colony as a convict. Besides being a commercial traveller\r\nfor some time, he had been in an apothecary’s shop in England, and\r\non obtaining partial exemption from convict discipline, became the\r\nprincipal druggist in Sydney. After a prosperous career he sold his\r\nbusiness for, it was said, £14,000, and judiciously invested this\r\nsum in buildings and other pursuits of profit. For nearly two years\r\nhe occupied the house opposite to mine in Sydney, which gave me\r\nalmost daily opportunity then of seeing him. He struck me as being a\r\nremarkably well-conducted person. He had once been a member of the\r\nSociety of Friends; he wore a broad-brimmed hat, appeared always in\r\na neat and carefully adjusted costume, and his whole appearance and\r\nmanner impressed one with the notion of his being a very saintly\r\npersonage. He always sought the society in public of persons of reputed\r\npiety. I have often met him in the street accompanied by a secretary or\r\ncollector to a charitable institution, whom he assisted in obtaining\r\ncontributions for benevolent objects. At one time he took up the cause\r\nof temperance in such an intemperate and silly spirit, that he ordered\r\na puncheon of rum he had imported to be staved on the wharf at Sydney,\r\nand its contents poured into the sea, saying that, ‘he would not be\r\ninstrumental to the guilt of disseminating such poison throughout the\r\ncolony.’ At another time his zeal took an apparently religious turn.\r\nHe built, in Macquarie Street, Sydney, a commodious meeting-house for\r\nthe Society of Friends, on the front of which was inscribed on a large\r\nsquare stone inserted in the wall some such words as these—\r\n\r\n  JOHN TAWELL\r\n  TO\r\n  THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nHe conveyed no title, however, to the Society to secure them the\r\ntenure of the property. After his execution it was sold, I understood,\r\nwith other portions of his property, for the benefit of the party\r\nentitled to it under his will, the Crown having waived its right to the\r\nforfeiture of the estate.\r\n\r\n“Tawell was himself a liberal contributor to charities, and the opinion\r\nof his character was so favourable, that the act for which he suffered\r\ncreated great astonishment in Sydney. A considerable part of his money\r\nhad been realised by buying up all the whalebone that trading vessels,\r\nat an early period, imported into Sydney. This he sent to a London\r\nhouse, where it was manufactured into combs, handles for brushes, and\r\nvarious other articles of domestic use. He was the first person in the\r\ncolony who converted whalebone into an article of profitable export.\r\nWhen he left the colony, he had a considerable property from rents and\r\nother sources which became much reduced by the general distress that\r\nprevailed in New South Wales in 1843.” Hence the anxiety expressed by\r\nhim for his Sydney letters, referred to in the course of his trial.\r\nStill, however, a man of good means, occupying a respected position\r\nin his town, and noted, through a long and industrious life, for his\r\nbenevolence and straightforward conduct in his relations with his\r\nneighbours, he might well say when first charged with the murder of his\r\nmistress, “My station in society places me beyond suspicion.” Such had\r\nbeen the remarkable career, and such was the ostensible character of\r\nthe man to whom the most cold-blooded of murders was clearly brought\r\nhome in the following trial.”\r\n\r\nAt the trial before Mr. Baron Parke, at Aylesbury, on the 12th, 13th,\r\nand 14th of March, 1845, Sergeant Byles and Mr. Prendergast appeared\r\nfor the prosecution, and Mr. Fitzroy Kelly, Q.C., Mr. Gunning, and Mr.\r\nO’Malley, assisted by Messrs. Herapath, of Bristol, Professor Graham\r\nand Dr. Letheby, of London, the eminent chemists, for the defence.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the excitement in the county caused by the event,\r\nnumerous objections were taken to jurymen by the prisoner’s counsel. At\r\nlength, however, a jury was formed, and after a brief recapitulation\r\nof the leading facts of the proposed evidence by Sergeant Byles, Mary\r\nAshley, a next door neighbour of the deceased, was called, who had\r\nseen Tawell go to Sarah Hart’s between 4 and 5 in the afternoon of the\r\n1st of January, and between 6 and 7 the same evening, “hearing a sort\r\nof stifled scream,” had gone to her door with a candle and seen him\r\nleaving the cottage. The cottages stood in a row, with small gardens\r\nin front, with rails and gates, and contained four rooms, two on the\r\nground floor, and the same number above.\r\n\r\n “The prisoner,” said the witness, “appeared to be agitated, and unable\r\n to open the gate. I opened it for him; it was fastened with a small\r\n button. When I went out of my house, I said, ‘I am afraid my neighbour\r\n is ill’—not speaking to any person in particular, but as the prisoner\r\n was then coming down the garden I should think that I spoke loud\r\n enough for him to hear me: I was about six yards from him. No reply\r\n was made by him. When I got to the gate I could hear Mrs. Hart still\r\n making the same description of noise: the prisoner made me no answer\r\n when I asked him if I should open the gate; he appeared very much\r\n agitated, and was trying in a hurried manner to open the gate; he came\r\n out of the gate before I went in; I saw his face; I held the candle\r\n over the gate to open it: I have no doubt that he is the same man,\r\n though I had never seen him before that afternoon. In the afternoon\r\n Mrs. Hart said to me, ‘I expect my old master, but perhaps he will\r\n not come till to-morrow.’ When I got to Mrs. Hart’s door it was shut,\r\n and upon my opening it I saw Mrs. Hart lying on the floor with her\r\n head not a great way from the door; her legs were towards the fire,\r\n her dress was quite in a disordered state, her petticoats nearly up\r\n to her knees, her left stocking down to her ankle, and torn, and her\r\n left shoe off: her cap was off, and her hair hanging down over her\r\n head: her cap was a little distance from her: she was still making a\r\n noise, and her eyes were fixed, but her lips moving. I took hold of\r\n her hands and raised her head, and said, ‘Oh, Mrs. Hart, what is the\r\n matter?’ She did not make any answer, but I thought she seemed to\r\n press my hand, but I could not positively tell. I then raised her up,\r\n and a little froth came out of her mouth, and I thought she was dying.\r\n I laid her down again, and took my candle and went into Mrs. Wheeler’s\r\n house, next door but one. When I went into Mrs. Hart’s I observed a\r\n bottle and a glass by the side of it half full, and another glass\r\n on the opposite side of the table, near the door, empty; but there\r\n appeared to be something in the bottom of it. A chair was beside Mrs.\r\n Hart, and another opposite her. I returned from Mrs. Wheeler’s with\r\n Mrs. Barrett, and we placed a pillow on the child’s chair and bathed\r\n her temples. One of Mrs. Barrett’s apprentices went for Dr. Champneys,\r\n and he came. I searched the place immediately, and found no small vial\r\n about the size of a thimble. There was a middling fire in the house.\r\n Before I got into the house I thought the prisoner was looking, and I\r\n locked the door, because I was frightened. The deceased was breathing\r\n hard in a short way, and making a noise like ‘oh! oh!’ and her eyes\r\n looked very full.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_ by _Mr. Kelly_, she said—\r\n\r\n “That she heard Mrs. Hart’s voice rather loud after Mr. Tawell went\r\n in—only a few words, but could not hear what she said. She did not\r\n think that they were quarrelling, but that perhaps Mrs. Hart was in\r\n hysterics, as money matters were always talked over when Tawell came.\r\n When Mr. Champneys came in, he said he must try to bleed her: he did\r\n so, and there was about as much blood as would cover a plate; she\r\n died immediately afterwards; indeed, I think she was dead when he\r\n bled her. About Christmas Mrs. Hart received a basket of apples as a\r\n present—about a peck, some of which were left in a box.”\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_, she said—\r\n\r\n “That it was not more than a minute after she left her own house that\r\n she entered Mrs. Hart’s, and that she saw about ten or a dozen apples\r\n in the box after her death.”\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Barrett_ confirmed Mrs. Ashley’s account of the condition in\r\nwhich she found the deceased, but did not see any foam on her lips\r\nuntil after she tried to pour some water down her throat.[8]\r\n\r\nIt was then proved by the barmaid at the “Windmill,” on Salthill, and a\r\ngardener, that about half after six on that day the deceased came there\r\nfor a bottle of Guinness’s stout, and that she was met between her\r\nhouse and the “Windmill” about the same time in high spirits running\r\ntowards her cottage.\r\n\r\nThe next witness spoke to the acts of the prisoner before he arrived\r\nat the cottage. At three o’clock in the afternoon he had been at the\r\nJerusalem Coffee-house, inquiring at what hour they closed, saying\r\nhe was going to the West End, and should not be back until half-past\r\neight, and wishing to leave a greatcoat and a parcel, which, by\r\narrangement with the waiter, he fetched away about half-past nine or a\r\nquarter to ten that night, leaving his umbrella there. Other witnesses\r\nproved his being seen running from Bath Place towards Slough, getting\r\ninto the Eton omnibus and stopping opposite Sir John Herschel’s house,\r\nthen returning towards the Slough station and leaving it for Paddington\r\nby the half-past eight train.[9] The evidence of the next witness, who\r\ntracked him from the moment of his arrival at Paddington, must be given\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\n_William Williams_ said—\r\n\r\n “I am a sergeant of police on the Great Western Railway, at Paddington\r\n Station. On the 1st of January, in consequence of a telegraphic\r\n communication, I observed the prisoner get out of a carriage and get\r\n into a New Road omnibus. I put on a private coat, and acted as guard.\r\n He got out opposite Princes’ Street, near the Bank, about a quarter\r\n past nine. I opened the door on purpose to look at him; he went\r\n towards the Wellington Statue, and then crossed over to Birch’s, the\r\n pastrycooks: he stood a moment, as if he was considering; I watched\r\n him from behind the statue. He then went towards the Jerusalem\r\n Coffee-house, and I followed him; he then went down a court into\r\n Birchin Lane, and from thence to Scott’s Yard, in the Borough, where\r\n he lodged, where I left him. On returning there next morning he was\r\n gone, so I went to the Jerusalem, and an officer (_Wiggins_) went\r\n in and took him into custody. Wiggins said to him that he was last\r\n seen in the house of a woman at Slough who was found dead, when he\r\n replied that, ‘I was not at Slough yesterday—I know no one there.’ I\r\n then remarked that I had seen him get off the train from Slough, and\r\n that he had given me sixpence after riding in the omnibus from the\r\n Paddington station. ‘You must be mistaken,’ he replied; ‘my station in\r\n life must rebut any suspicion that might be attached to me.’”\r\n\r\n_Wiggins_, an inspector of the Metropolitan police, gave a graphic\r\naccount of the arrest.\r\n\r\n “On Thursday, the 2nd of January, I went into the Jerusalem\r\n Coffee-house with the last witness, and asked the prisoner if his\r\n name was Tawell; he said, ‘Yes.’ I then asked him if he had been at\r\n Slough last night, and he said, ‘No, I did not leave town all day\r\n yesterday.’ I then opened my coat, showed my uniform, and said, ‘I\r\n want you concerning the woman you were with last night.’ He said,\r\n ‘I don’t know anyone there.’ I said, ‘There was a woman found dead\r\n there, and you are supposed to be the last person who was seen with\r\n her alive.’ He said, ‘Thee must be mistaken in the identity, my\r\n station in society places me beyond suspicion.’ I then took him down\r\n to Salt Hill, to the ‘Three Tuns,’ where the inquest was being held.\r\n I searched him, and found £12. 10_s._ in gold and £1. 1_s._ 6_d._ in\r\n silver, a gold watch, and a letter addressed to him, which he said he\r\n had received from his wife. On the second day of the inquest I saw him\r\n again. After consulting with his lawyer, he said to me, ‘I took thee\r\n for a gentleman in the railway carriage.’ I said, ‘I told you I was an\r\n officer.’ He replied, ‘Yes, but that was afterwards.’ The first day of\r\n the inquest he said, ‘Mind, I have disclosed nothing.’”\r\n\r\nIn _cross-examination, Mr. Kelly_ failed to get the witness to say that\r\nwhen asked about Slough the prisoner said he came from Berkhampstead,\r\nand only led the witness to reiterate that he stated “that he had not\r\nbeen at Slough that day.”\r\n\r\nTo _Perkins_, the inspector of the Eton police, Tawell was dangerously\r\ncommunicative.\r\n\r\n “On the day after I had taken him into custody,” said this witness,\r\n “and brought him to my own house, after he had seen his lawyer, he\r\n said to me, ‘The unfortunate woman once lived in my service, about two\r\n years and a half, or nearly so.’ He asked me if I knew this. I told\r\n him I had heard so. Then Holmes, the other constable, came in, and he\r\n added, ‘She left my service about five years ago.’ I told him whatever\r\n he said I should communicate to the coroner to-morrow. He said, ‘he\r\n would have no objection to that,’ and then continued, ‘she had been in\r\n the habit of writing letters to him for money,’ and that he had been\r\n pestered with her; she was a very good servant when in his service,\r\n but a bad principled woman. She wrote to him that if he did not send\r\n her something she would make away with herself. He came down to her\r\n house and told her that he would not give her any more money. She then\r\n asked him if he would not give her some porter. I then sent for a\r\n bottle of stout, and she had a glass and I had a glass. She then took\r\n out a small phial, about the size of a thimble, and said, “I will,\r\n I will,” and poured some into her glass and drank a part of it—the\r\n remainder was thrown into the fire. She then done herself about and\r\n laid down on the hearth-rug; I then went out. I did not think she was\r\n in earnest, otherwise I would have called somebody.’ I asked him if he\r\n had got those letters, and he said, ‘No, I never keep such letters as\r\n those.’ I knew him by person, having seen him at Aylesbury.”\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ was unimportant—mainly directed to the\r\nprobable inaccuracy of his recollection and to the nature of the\r\ncommunication he made to the coroner. _Holmes_, in addition to\r\nconfirming _Perkins’_ report of the prisoner’s statement, was present\r\nwhen Mrs. Tawell visited her husband, when, in reply to her question,\r\n“what he had been doing,” he replied, “Nothing. I hope you will forgive\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_H. Montague Champneys_, surgeon at Salthill, sent for a few minutes\r\nbefore 7 P.M. on January 1st, said—\r\n\r\n “I ran, and when I got there saw deceased on the floor, felt her\r\n pulse, but am not certain whether I felt any pulsation. I put my\r\n hand under her clothes over her heart, and could not discover any\r\n pulsation; considered her dead, but still thought it best to open a\r\n vein in her arm, and obtained about an ounce of blood. Next day I\r\n made a _post mortem_ examination with Mr. Norblad and Mr. Pickering.\r\n Having previously examined the external parts, we opened the body,\r\n when I smelt the odour of prussic acid; the lungs were perfectly\r\n healthy, but the coverings had the appearance of inflammation.\r\n Examined stomach and contents. Rather more mucus than there ought to\r\n be; the abdominal viscera perfectly healthy. Put contents of stomach\r\n into a bottle, which I, with Messrs. Norblad and Pickering, took to\r\n Mr. Cooper, in London. The contents were tested for sulphuric acid,\r\n oxalic acid, and some poisonous salts, but nothing was discovered;\r\n afterwards an experiment was tried for prussic acid. Mr. Cooper tried\r\n protosulphate of iron, and also nitrate of silver, but could not\r\n during the experiment discover any prussic acid; but nevertheless,\r\n it is my opinion that she died from the effects of that poison. On\r\n the following Sunday I took the beer and the part of a bun found on\r\n the table to Mr. Cooper, which were tested for prussic acid, but\r\n none discovered. When I stated that in my opinion the deceased died\r\n from the effects of prussic acid I did not know that the prisoner\r\n had bought any. I know Scheele’s prussic acid and that of the London\r\n Pharmacopœia; less than a grain of pure prussic acid would be a dose;\r\n two drams of Scheele’s would contain six grains. There are cases on\r\n record where the smell of prussic acid could not be discovered in the\r\n stomach of a person who had taken it. A person in Paris died from\r\n taking seven-tenths of a grain. Prussic acid is volatile, and may\r\n be carried off by the lungs or absorbed by the tissues. There is a\r\n case in the _Lancet_ of a person dying from having less than a grain\r\n administered to her. After this occurrence I put thirty grains of\r\n Scheele’s acid into a glass of Guinness’s stout, and the smell was\r\n scarcely perceptible. The symptoms would come on in less than two\r\n minutes.”\r\n\r\nIn the very minute and detailed _cross-examination_ to which\r\nthis witness was subjected by _Mr. Kelly_, he made the following\r\nstatements:—\r\n\r\n “I have no experience in detecting the odour of prussic acid in a\r\n human subject—should think it may be taken without detection; should\r\n expect to find the odour in the mouth and in the breath, but there may\r\n be exceptions. Neither Mr. Pickering nor Mr. Norblad smelt it when\r\n the body was opened. It was not a conjecture of mine; I was positive\r\n of it. The smell is very peculiar and strong, and easy to be detected\r\n by those acquainted with it. It is more likely to be detected when\r\n exposed as this was to a heat of 212 degrees. At every heat we tried\r\n to smell it, but failed. There was no such smell in the blood which I\r\n drew shortly after death. I am not competent to say whether epileptic\r\n patients die more quickly from prussic acid than others. It is said to\r\n act powerfully on the nervous system. Have read the case of the seven\r\n epileptic patients who died from a dose of seven-tenths of a grain\r\n each in from thirty to forty-five hours. There was a case in which the\r\n French doctors discovered poison eight days after death.\r\n\r\n “This acid exists in a great number of substances, in apples for\r\n instance, and probably in many other substances in which it has never\r\n been discovered. I agree with Dr. Christisön in his opinion (p. 756)\r\n in respect of the formation of this acid in various organic substances\r\n and other articles. It is made from the blood, bones, and horns of\r\n animals. It consists of 12 carbon, 14 nitrogen, and 1 hydrogen. Those\r\n are its elements. They exist and can be obtained in great quantities\r\n from various substances—cherry-stones, and stones of various fruits;\r\n they are found in the human saliva, but not in the form of prussic\r\n acid. It (the salt) is called sulphocyanide, and when taken is\r\n perceptible in the blood and breath, but most in the stomach.[10] In\r\n apple-pips or other substances the smell would not be given off until\r\n disengaged by some process for that purpose.\r\n\r\n “During the experiments for oxalic acid and other poisons, Messrs.\r\n Cooper, Pickering, and Norblad failed to perceive any smell. One of\r\n them then came to the conclusion that there must be prussic acid.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Did Mr. Cooper then apply a process which would set free\r\n prussic acid from apple-pips and other substances?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I believe that is the process, but it was not carried\r\n to the full extent. I refer to the heat. When this new process was\r\n applied, the result was that prussic acid was found. I did not smell\r\n it, nor anyone else. Beyond the smell in opening the body, I smelt\r\n none at all.”\r\n\r\n “When I first saw the deceased I thought I felt a few beats of the\r\n pulse, but I imagine that I was mistaken. It might have been the\r\n pulse in my own finger. The analogy between animals and human beings\r\n dying of prussic acid is considered doubtful by the best authorities.\r\n The heart would continue to beat for a short time after the pulse\r\n had receded from the arms. The lungs might be considered slightly\r\n congested.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Kelly._—“Why then inform my learned friend that they were sound\r\n and healthy?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“The lungs themselves were not diseased.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Kelly._—“Is it natural and healthy when the lungs are congested?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“They contained rather more blood than usual.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Kelly._—“Is that a healthy state?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Not perfectly so.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Kelly._—“Is not congested lungs the cause of various modes of\r\n sudden death?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n “I then examined the _pericardium_, it was empty. The heart had a\r\n natural appearance. I do not recollect that I examined the arteries\r\n proceeding from the aorta. Any disease of the coronary arteries is\r\n likely to cause sudden death. I did not examine the spinal marrow.\r\n The valves of the heart were very clear. Death might suddenly result\r\n from the adhesion of the spinal marrow, if it had existed some time. A\r\n sudden termination also might take place where the disease is latent.\r\n I looked at the gall-bladder, the colour was natural. My experience\r\n teaches me that prussic acid would colour it blue.[11] I examined the\r\n œsophagus to see if there was any foreign substance, and found none. I\r\n opened the trachea, but not the bronchial tubes, so I could not tell\r\n whether there was water in them or not. When I felt the pulse and\r\n heart of the deceased I was satisfied that she was dead, still I bled\r\n her, as I thought it best to try every means to restore animation.\r\n I did not do it to ascertain the cause of death. I then got no\r\n information as to the cause of death. I saw a slight motion of the jaw\r\n as I felt the pulse, and apprehend she died then. I took the stomach\r\n from the body eighteen hours after death. The contents were turned\r\n into a jug or basin, and afterwards into a bottle. I do not know\r\n for what purpose the bottle had been used. I did not wash it out.”\r\n (_The bottle was here produced, a large-mouthed one, like a pickle\r\n bottle._) The witness then stated what care he took of it to prevent\r\n its being tampered with before taking it to Mr. Cooper:—“The exact\r\n dose to cause death is still undetermined, also whether the effect\r\n is cumulative or not, also the effect of the same quantity diluted\r\n more or less is unsettled. Scheele’s prussic acid varies in strength.\r\n Prussic acid evaporates by keeping.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Kelly, reading from Watson’s “Lectures on Physic.”_—“Do you\r\n agree to this—‘A blow, a fall, an electric shock, a teaspoonful\r\n of prussic acid, may cause death and leave no trace on the nervous\r\n system?’”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\nOn his _re-examination_ by _Serjt. Byles_, the witness said:—\r\n\r\n “In the case of the seven epileptic patients two medical men did\r\n not smell the acid, but two chemists did some time afterwards. It\r\n requires an extensive experience readily to detect the smell. Some may\r\n perceive it, some not. Several persons should smell, some not being\r\n so susceptible of the odour as others. I agree with a French chemist\r\n that ‘under a considerable number of circumstances there must be great\r\n practical knowledge to detect smell.’ If a person once knows the\r\n smell, I think he will know it again.”[12]\r\n\r\n “I should think that before prussic acid could be obtained from horns,\r\n blood, and bones of animals, a heat of from 400 to 500 degrees would\r\n be necessary. All animals, whether human or not, die if they take\r\n prussic acid. There is no difference in its operation upon man and the\r\n inferior animals. There was no appearance of disease in the heart of\r\n the deceased. Had there been any rupture of the coronary arteries it\r\n would have been apparent. I never knew such a disease of the spinal\r\n marrow to cause sudden death. I know only of the two cases mentioned\r\n by Taylor of the gall bladder having a blue tint. The absence of it\r\n is no proof that the person did not die from prussic acid. The bottle\r\n into which I put the contents was perfectly clean and dry. The ends\r\n of the stomach were securely tied up with string when I moved the\r\n contents into the jug, which was also perfectly dry and clean. I have\r\n no doubt the deceased died from prussic acid.”\r\n\r\nAfter two constables (_Hill_ and _Larkin_) had proved the finding of a\r\nphial in a cupboard and two others in a jug, one of which contained\r\nhartshorn, the case was adjourned to the following morning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_SECOND DAY. Thursday_, MARCH 13.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUPPOSED PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO POISON.\r\n\r\n_Charlotte Howard_, unmarried, a servant, said:—\r\n\r\n “I knew Mrs. Hart, and went to see her at Salthill on the 26th\r\n September, 1843. She had a child of mine in her care. I was there from\r\n three to four months, in which time I saw Mr. Tawell there twice. On\r\n the 30th of September he came, and in ten minutes after, Mrs. Hart\r\n sent me out for a bottle of stout, which I got and gave to her. She\r\n took it into the room where he was. Shortly after she came out and\r\n sent me for a sheet of paper, leaving Mr. Tawell in the room with\r\n the stout. When I came back she said to me ‘I am so ill, I shall be\r\n obliged to tell my master to go; I am so sick, my head is so bad.’\r\n She was very sick, and I helped her upstairs to bed. After she got\r\n upstairs she was sick again. She was in very good health when Tawell\r\n came. She said she only drank one glass of porter and felt sick\r\n directly afterwards. I went down again and saw eighteen sovereigns on\r\n the table, which I put into a drawer. There was some porter in the\r\n glasses and in the bottle. That in the glasses I threw away, and drank\r\n that in the bottle, and it did not make me ill. Mrs. Hart complained\r\n of being very giddy, but did not say anything about her throat.”\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Cooper_, the Analytical Chemist and Lecturer on Medical\r\nJurisprudence, was then called and examined by _Serjeant Byles_.\r\n\r\n “On the 3rd of January,” said the witness, “Messrs. Champneys,\r\n Norblad, and Pickering called on me with a carpet bag. The bag\r\n contained a bottle (ordinary one, such as olives are usually sold\r\n in) full or nearly so with the contents of the stomach; a portion\r\n of porter in an ordinary beer-bottle, on which was a paper label\r\n signifying that it contained Guinness’s beer; a glass tumbler, about\r\n half full of what appeared to be a mixture of beer and water; a part\r\n of a plum bun, and a phial containing a few drops (perhaps about half\r\n a drachm) of a nearly colourless fluid; a small piece of pink paper,\r\n such as is generally used by apothecaries for tying over the corks of\r\n medicine phials, and had apparently been used for such purpose; and\r\n the stomach and part of the intestines. The bottle which contained the\r\n contents of the stomach was tied over with a piece of bladder, and,\r\n I think, corked as well, but of the latter I am not certain; it was\r\n opened and smelt strongly of food in the progress of digestion, it\r\n had also the smell of beer. On the application of litmus paper to the\r\n surface of the contents it became red instantly, and so very red that\r\n I was disposed to consider that Mr. Norblad and the other gentlemen\r\n were right in their conjecture as to its containing oxalic acid. A\r\n portion was now taken out of this bottle and put into a porcelain\r\n evaporating basin, to which some distilled water was added, and\r\n stirred well together with a glass rod; the basin with its contents\r\n was then placed on the heated sand bath and kept stirring until it\r\n boiled, and even after it had boiled for some minutes. During the\r\n whole of this operation I was standing over it, and the vapour that\r\n escaped I smelt the whole time, but did not recognise the slightest\r\n odour of prussic acid; the odour was the same as that of the contents\r\n of the bottle, but it was more powerful. The contents of the basin\r\n were then put into a paper filter placed in a glass funnel, and that\r\n which passed through the filter was collected in a glass vessel placed\r\n for its reception. While this operation was going on I directed my\r\n attention to the contents of the beer bottle and the tumbler. I found\r\n them both to have an acid reaction on litmus paper, the contents of\r\n the beer bottle very decidedly so; but on the application of the usual\r\n tests employed for the detection of oxalic acid, not a trace of it\r\n could be found.\r\n\r\n “By this time a small quantity of clear liquid from the contents\r\n of the basin had passed the filter; this was removed from the\r\n glass vessel employed to receive it into a test glass, and on the\r\n application of the tests for the detection of oxalic acid not the\r\n smallest trace was indicated. I then felt quite certain that oxalic\r\n acid had not been the cause of death.\r\n\r\n “I was then shown the stomach by Messrs. Champneys and Norblad, and on\r\n examining its interior surface it did not appear to have been acted\r\n on by any corrosive substance: nevertheless I thought it advisable to\r\n search for sulphuric acid, and accordingly applied to a small portion\r\n of the liquid, filtered from that which had been boiled, the test for\r\n that substance, but none could be detected. In like manner I did also\r\n apply the tests for the detection of baryta, opium, arsenic, the\r\n salts of mercury, and other metallic poisons, and could find none of\r\n them. I then came to the conclusion that, if the person had died from\r\n the effect of poison, it could be no other than prussic acid.\r\n\r\n “A portion of the contents of the stomach was then taken from\r\n the bottle and put into a tubulated retort, to which was added a\r\n very small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid; the retort with its\r\n contents was placed on the sand bath, a receiver applied and a\r\n portion distilled off. When about two drachms of clear liquid had\r\n distilled over, it was removed from the receiver into a test glass,\r\n about a grain of green sulphate of iron was added, and when this\r\n was dissolved, a small quantity of solution of potassa. These were\r\n allowed to remain a short time together and stirred with a glass rod.\r\n Subsequently muriatic acid was added in sufficient quantity _when\r\n instantly Prussian blue appeared_, which could not have resulted\r\n unless cyanogen or hydrocyanic acid had been present. But it could not\r\n be recognised by the smell. Although I had no doubt in my own mind,\r\n from the gentle heat that had been employed in the above detailed\r\n process of distillation, that the prussic acid could not have resulted\r\n from any decomposition of the animal matters present in the contents\r\n of the stomach, yet I thought it prudent to conduct the process of\r\n distillation in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of such\r\n occurrence.\r\n\r\n “Another and much larger portion of the contents of the stomach was\r\n put into another retort, to which a little dilute sulphuric acid\r\n was added as before, and the retort with its contents placed in a\r\n water bath, to which some common salt was added. The salt-water bath\r\n was heated until it boiled; a receiver was put on to the retort, an\r\n adapter intervening so as to remove the receiver to a greater distance\r\n from the furnace, and the receiver was kept as cool as possible by\r\n folds of blotting paper kept constantly wet applied to its external\r\n surface. In this manner was the distillation slowly conducted, until\r\n about an ounce of clear liquid had distilled over.”\r\n\r\n On the removal of this liquid from the receiver it had the same smell\r\n as that contained in the bottle had before distillation, and neither\r\n myself, Mr. Norblad, Mr. Champneys, nor my son could detect the smell\r\n of prussic acid in the slightest degree. In fact the odour of beer and\r\n digesting food was so powerful as to cover or disguise the smell of\r\n the prussic acid in this weak state, but on applying the same tests as\r\n before Prussian blue was found in considerable quantity.\r\n\r\n “The few drops of liquid which were in the phial before mentioned\r\n were now examined: they had no action on litmus paper, they smelt of\r\n camphor and acetate of ammonia. The test for prussic acid was applied,\r\n but it did not show the smallest quantity. The phial was then washed\r\n out, and the distilled liquid, with the precipitated Prussian blue\r\n obtained by the two above-detailed processes was put into it. It was\r\n corked up and taken by Messrs. Norblad and Champneys to keep in their\r\n possession. I also added the same test to distilled water containing\r\n a few drops of prussic acid, for the sake of comparison and to try\r\n the test. This was also taken by Messrs. Norblad and Champneys, as\r\n was also some distilled water with the same tests applied, to which\r\n no prussic acid had been added, and which was colourless. As far as I\r\n can recollect this completed the first day’s proceedings, it being now\r\n nearly dark.\r\n\r\n “On the evening of the following day (Saturday) Mr. Pickering came\r\n to me to request I would on the Monday following examine, by the\r\n coroner’s desire, the contents of the glass tumbler, the beer bottle,\r\n and the remainder of the beer, to determine if prussic acid existed\r\n in any of them. On Sunday the 6th, being engaged at Derby on the\r\n Monday, Messrs. Norblad and Champneys came, bringing with them the\r\n whole of the things they took away with them on the Friday. The beer,\r\n the contents of the tumbler, and the remains of the plum bun we each\r\n subjected separately to distillation in the salt-water bath, and to\r\n the liquor obtained by distillation the same tests for detecting\r\n prussic acid were added, but not a trace could be found.\r\n\r\n “I may here observe that, on the intervening Saturday, I continued the\r\n distillation of the larger portion before spoken of for the purpose of\r\n obtaining more of the distilled liquid, and in fact to continue the\r\n distillation until the whole of the prussic acid had been separated.\r\n A part of the distilled liquor had its Prussian blue precipitated,\r\n which was given to Messrs. Norblad and Champneys on the Sunday, and to\r\n another part I added nitrate of silver for the purpose of separating\r\n the hydrocyanic acid, or rather the cyanogen it contained. I kept\r\n it safe from decomposition or change during my absence, and for the\r\n purpose of further experiments on my return, and at my leisure.\r\n\r\n “Accordingly, shortly after my return, I put the cyanide of silver\r\n obtained by the above process, together with some very dilute muriatic\r\n acid, into a small retort, to which a receiver was attached. The\r\n retort was placed over a lamp in order to be heated, and the receiver\r\n was surrounded by cold water. The distillation proceeded until about a\r\n drachm and a half had distilled over. _This liquor possessed the odour\r\n of prussic acid_, distinctly recognised by myself, and also by two of\r\n my sons.\r\n\r\n “It occurred to me that as Messrs. Norblad, Champneys, and myself had\r\n distinctly seen among the contents of the stomach some undigested\r\n apples, that the seeds or pips of the apple might give rise to the\r\n formation of prussic acid by distillation. I therefore determined on\r\n making an experiment to see if any and what quantity of prussic acid\r\n they were capable of producing. Accordingly the seeds from fifteen\r\n apples were bruised and put into a retort with some distilled water,\r\n and about an ounce of liquor was distilled off. On the application\r\n of the tests before spoken of, Prussian blue, in exceeding small\r\n quantity, was produced. On testing the last product of distillation,\r\n no Prussian blue was found. I have the whole of the Prussian blue thus\r\n produced.\r\n\r\n “About ten days ago I was applied to and requested to make more\r\n experiments for the purpose (if possible) of discovering the whole\r\n amount of prussic acid originally contained in the contents of the\r\n stomach, or at least of that portion brought to me. I stated that I\r\n had not the means in my possession of doing so, and that Mr. Norblad\r\n or Mr. Champneys possessed almost everything relating to the matter;\r\n but I thought it possible, if I had the remainder of the contents of\r\n the stomach, and that if it were contained in the same bottle in which\r\n it was originally brought, I might be able to do so—having a distinct\r\n recollection of about the height at which the matter stood in the\r\n neck of the bottle. Mr. Champneys, on Saturday, the 8th of February,\r\n delivered, with other matters, into my charge, the remainder of the\r\n contents of the stomach which had not before been subjected to any\r\n operation or experiment, and which, when I gave it him back, after my\r\n former experiments, I requested him to keep in a cool dark place for\r\n further investigation, should it be deemed requisite. The bottle was\r\n tightly corked and securely tied over with a piece of bladder. Before\r\n uncorking it, I made a mark with a file outside the bottle coincident\r\n with the surface of the contents in the interior. I then emptied the\r\n contents into a glass alembic, washed the bottle out with a little\r\n distilled water, and added this to the matter in the alembic. The head\r\n of the alembic was then put on, a condensing apparatus attached, the\r\n alembic placed as before on a salt-water bath, the bath brought to\r\n the boiling point, and distillation conducted until the whole of the\r\n prussic acid was expelled. A solution of nitrate of silver was put\r\n into the recipient for the purpose of seizing hold of the hydrocyanic\r\n acid the moment it reached that vessel. By this process I succeeded\r\n in obtaining 1·455 grains of dry cyanide of silver, very slightly\r\n contaminated with chloride of silver. The latter did not amount to\r\n a quantity which could be collected and weighed. But if I allow\r\n 0·025 grains, and call the quantity of cyanide of silver produced in\r\n reality 1·43 on the quantity operated on in this instance, it must be\r\n very near the truth. But as the quantity operated on in this instance\r\n formed only 51 parts out of the 180 of the whole volume of the\r\n contents of the bottle as it was first brought to me, the following\r\n proportion will show how much was contained in the whole. For if 51\r\n parts give 1·43 grains of cyanide of silver, 180 parts will give\r\n 5·047 grains of cyanide of silver. This quantity of cyanide of silver\r\n is equivalent to 1·002 grains of real hydrocyanic or prussic acid,\r\n which is equal to 50 grains of the prussic acid of the strength of\r\n the London Pharmacopeia. The determination of the relative quantity\r\n operated on, and the original volume of the contents of the stomach,\r\n was ascertained by measuring, with water, the bottle filled, as near\r\n as possible to remember, to that part in the neck where the contents\r\n originally stood, which was 180½ drachms, and to the mark made by the\r\n file 51½ drachms.\r\n\r\n “I may also remark that the contents of the stomach, after\r\n distillation, was still strongly acid, occasioned most probably by the\r\n acid in the beer, and also by the acid which is invariably produced\r\n during the process of digestion.”[13]\r\n\r\nDuring his _examination, Mr. Cooper_ produced the bottles\r\ncontaining the Prussian blue produced from the stomach and from the\r\napple-pips—the former dark blue in colour, the latter hardly more\r\nthan tinged with it. When placed side by side on the front of the\r\nwitness-box the marked contrast caused much excitement in Court.\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of this witness by _Mr. Kelly_ was so\r\nimportant, that though very lengthy it is necessary to give it in\r\nconsiderable detail.\r\n\r\n “Until this case,” said the witness, “I had never examined the\r\n contents of a human stomach where a person had been killed by prussic\r\n acid, or a human stomach containing prussic acid. Respecting the\r\n effect of prussic acid on the stomach and tissues of the body, my\r\n knowledge is only theoretical. Prussic acid, which I have smelt from\r\n its most concentrated to its weakest state, has a peculiar smell; it\r\n affects different persons differently. When I smell it, it affects\r\n spasmodically the back of the throat. But it loses its smell in\r\n combinations. I am not aware what quantity of prussic acid destroys\r\n life. I have no practical knowledge on the subject. The case I am most\r\n familiar with is that of the seven epileptics.\r\n\r\n “I began my investigation with the view of seeing if oxalic acid was\r\n present. I recognised the odour of beer more strongly in the contents\r\n of the stomach than anything else. I did not trace the smell of\r\n prussic acid in them, nor feel any spasmodic affection in the throat\r\n in smelling them. I did not come to the conclusion, after trying for\r\n those acids and mercurial poisons, which I did not discover, that\r\n there was prussic acid in the stomach, but I remarked to those present\r\n at that time, ‘Well, if this person has taken poison, it must be\r\n prussic acid.’\r\n\r\n “I have no idea how much Prussian blue I obtained from the first\r\n experiment, as it was made in a hurry. (_The bottle of dark blue\r\n liquid was here shown again._) I thought the obtaining evidence of its\r\n presence sufficient. I got more Prussian blue in the second experiment\r\n than in the first, and more in the third experiment than the second. I\r\n have not calculated the total amount of Prussian blue in the bottle.”\r\n\r\n _As to the contents of the stomach_: “There was undigested flesh and a\r\n pulpy mass of which I could make nothing, and some portion of apple,\r\n but no pips either partially digested or undigested with the apple.\r\n I am not prepared to say that the pips of this apple contained more\r\n prussic acid than others. There is a great difference between bitter\r\n and sweet apples—_the bitter contain a great deal of prussic acid,\r\n the sweet, I believe, none_.”[14]\r\n\r\n _As to prussic acid being in many substances_: “Strictly speaking, I\r\n don’t think it exists in any substance, not even in bitter almonds.\r\n I mean in a free state; it is so extremely volatile that it cannot\r\n possibly exist unless in combination with some other substance. It is\r\n my opinion that prussic acid is a ‘product,’ and not an ‘educt’—that\r\n is to say, in consequence of its great volatility it cannot exist\r\n unless in combination with some other substance; you liberate it by\r\n combination and change. The elements of it exist in a great many\r\n substances. These elements, on taking new arrangements, may produce\r\n prussic acid. Therefore I feel that it is always a ‘product,’ and that\r\n it does not exist in any substance in a free state, because if it did\r\n it would be continually evaporating from that substance.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Are not the substances which are already known to\r\n contain the elements of prussic acid, and from which it can be\r\n obtained, very numerous?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“They are very numerous certainly, because all those\r\n compounds which contain carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, may,\r\n in my opinion, by new changes be made to produce prussic acid. All\r\n animal substances of any kind contain those elements, in which are\r\n contained the elements of prussic acid. I agree, as far as I know,\r\n with Christison, that the distilled seeds of bitter almonds, and\r\n pomaceous seeds, yield prussic acid by distillation.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is it not found, from time to time, by accident or\r\n experiment, to exist in organic and other matters?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I believe it is. I was the first person to discover it\r\n in fulminating silver, and perhaps also in apple-pips, from recent\r\n experiments. I am not aware of it ever having been produced by mere\r\n organic changes in the stomach. If the apple-pips on which I operated\r\n had been macerated, I cannot say that I should have obtained more\r\n Prussian blue. I know it is the habit to macerate bitter almonds, but\r\n I also know that without maceration they have sometimes yielded more\r\n prussic acid than with maceration.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“I will ask you one question more, ‘Do you agree with Dr.\r\n Taylor that the odour of prussic acid, which is said to be peculiar,\r\n may be found when all tests fail?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“_I do not believe it._ As far as my experience goes, it\r\n would lead me to the contrary conclusion.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“But if I understand you rightly, you do not smell\r\n prussic acid, but feel its effects in another way?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Sometimes it has produced a spasmodic constriction about\r\n the throat, without my smelling it. At other times I have distinctly\r\n smelt it. It depends very much, I think, on the state of the nasal\r\n organ at the time.”\r\n\r\n _To Serjeant Byles._—“The same peculiar action at the back of the\r\n throat is, I think, felt by others on putting prussic acid to the\r\n nose. I communicated the nature of my evidence to the solicitor of the\r\n prisoner about a month ago.”\r\n\r\n _Baron Parke._—“Have you or have you not a doubt upon your mind from\r\n the result of your experiments as to the existence of prussic acid in\r\n the stomach?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“None whatever! I have no doubt that prussic acid may\r\n exist without being smelt.”\r\n\r\n _Baron Parke._—“If there was an absence of smell, would you suppose\r\n that the prussic acid was present in the shape of a salt, and that,\r\n therefore, you did not smell it?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Absence of smell may arise from dilution, or from its\r\n being covered by the smell of other substances.”\r\n\r\n _Baron Parke._—“Do you, in this particular case, ascribe the absence\r\n of smell to the circumstance of the prussic acid being in the form of\r\n a salt?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“_No, because it could not exist in the stomach as a\r\n cyanide of potassium, which is a salt, or as a cyanide of soda, when\r\n another and more powerful acid was present; as, for instance, muriatic\r\n acid, which in this case was found in considerable quantity, it being\r\n an acid generated by the process of digestion._”\r\n\r\n _Baron Parke._—“Do you not believe that there was also acetic acid\r\n present. Is not that a strong acid?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I have no doubt there was also acetic acid present, and\r\n it would have a greater affinity for soda or potash than prussic acid.\r\n I think prussic acid cannot be formed by putrefaction in the stomach.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Joseph Cooper_, a son of the last witness, and his assistant for\r\nfour years, deposed to having smelt the ordinary prussic acid at the\r\ntime in the process, mentioned by his father.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Norblad_, surgeon and apothecary at Slough for 10 years, said:\r\n\r\n “On January 2 I went to Mrs. Hart’s house and saw her body; have heard\r\n the evidence of Mr. Champneys, and should say that death was caused by\r\n prussic or oxalic acid; do not know of any other poisons that would\r\n produce death so rapidly; was present at Mr. Cooper’s experiments;\r\n have heard and perfectly agree with his evidence; oxalic acid must\r\n have been detected if present; I am quite of opinion that prussic acid\r\n was present in the stomach, and have no doubt about it; have heard\r\n the evidence of the witness Howard, the symptoms she describes (of\r\n supposed former attempt) are precisely those of prussic acid. That\r\n acid acts uniformly upon all animal subjects, and destroys life in\r\n the same way in all cases. Have tried experiments on dogs, and have\r\n seen cats and dogs poisoned by that acid. On the 18th February I made\r\n an experiment on two dogs. Five hours after feeding them I gave one\r\n of them half an ounce and the other one drachm of Scheele’s acid,\r\n administered it at 7 p.m., and exactly in ten seconds after receiving\r\n the smaller dose the dog fell as if dead, and the other in half the\r\n time; _I opened their bodies eighteen hours after and could not\r\n discover any odour_; I smelt the mouth of the dog and could not detect\r\n it then, nor at any other time; I opened the stomach of the dog, which\r\n smelt intensely of sour beer, the acid having been administered in\r\n beer. I attributed the absence of smell to the admixture of Guinness’s\r\n stout; I should have expected on opening Mrs. Hart’s body to have\r\n discovered the cause of death.”\r\n\r\n _By the Court._—“I examined the brain; it was perfectly healthy;\r\n death did not arise from apoplexy.”\r\n\r\n _By Serjeant Byles._—“Less than a grain of pure prussic acid would be\r\n sufficient to produce death.”\r\n\r\n_Cross-examined_ by _Mr. Kelly_:—\r\n\r\n “I have never attended any one who had taken prussic acid except in\r\n the form of medicine. The average dose of Scheele’s is five minims,\r\n and a minim is about a grain. Never heard of prussic acid being\r\n administered externally for varicose veins, and should think it\r\n useless (_prescription handed to him_). That is a proper prescription\r\n for varicose veins. I agree with Dr. Thompson, of London, that prussic\r\n acid may be applied successfully to diseases of the skin and cancerous\r\n affections to alleviate pain. I consider my sense of smell very acute.\r\n _I mixed twelve grains of prussic acid with a pint of porter, but\r\n could not smell it. Some porter dropped on the table and I did then\r\n smell it._ I know that prussic acid when combined with the blood of\r\n an animal volatilises very rapidly when exposed to the air. There is\r\n a case in which prussic acid appears to have allayed irritation of\r\n the stomach; it is a useful medicine sometimes in small doses. I have\r\n seen dogs vomit after it. Disease of the heart would produce death\r\n from mental emotion or rupture of the coronaries of the heart. Forcing\r\n water down the throat of a person in a syncope might cause sudden\r\n death. There was no congestion or gorging of the lungs. I saw but did\r\n not examine specially the coronary arteries.”\r\n\r\n _Kelly._—“If sudden death had occurred from a disease of the coronary\r\n arteries, what would be the appearance of the lungs?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“The lungs have nothing to do with the coronary arteries;\r\n ossification of them is supposed to cause sudden death. The blood in\r\n the lungs would not be prevented from returning the heart so as to\r\n gorge the lungs. I did not see any symptoms of the coronary arteries\r\n being ossified.”\r\n\r\n “I examined the lungs carefully. The lungs have been found gorged in\r\n some persons who have died of prussic acid. I don’t think that what\r\n has been called congestion was always clearly so. In all cases of\r\n paralysis of the heart, the blood has not been returned to the heart,\r\n and remaining in it gorges the lungs. Death by prussic acid paralyses\r\n the heart. In death from prussic acid, death is often denoted by an\r\n involuntary scream. I cannot say that I have heard of a succession\r\n of screams in any case of the kind. When I first saw the body, my\r\n impression was that death had been caused by oxalic acid, and that\r\n impression continued until the tests were applied. Blackness of the\r\n stomach is a symptom. There was a dark spot on the surface of the\r\n stomach. I have not seen a case of poisoning by oxalic acid.”\r\n\r\n_Re-examined by Mr. Prendergast._\r\n\r\n “There was nothing in the stifled screams described by Mrs. Ashley\r\n yesterday at all inconsistent with poisoning by prussic acid; on the\r\n contrary, the catching of the breath is the last symptom. Less than\r\n one grain of prussic acid will kill a healthy person.”\r\n\r\n _By the Court._—“I saw nothing on the brain to indicate death by\r\n apoplexy. If a sudden emotion had caused death I don’t think I could\r\n have told that by the brain.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pickering, who had been in practice as a surgeon for nine years,\r\nand was present when Mr. Champneys made the first incision through the\r\ninteguments, said he then smelt the odour of prussic acid,[15] and\r\nconfirmed the accounts of the previous witnesses of the experiments in\r\nMr. Cooper’s laboratory. On _cross-examination_ he admitted that before\r\nthey examined the body they were led to suppose that the death had\r\nbeen caused by poison, and that he had never seen a case of death from\r\npoisoning either by oxalic or prussic acid.\r\n\r\nPrevious visits of Tawell to Mrs. Hart, were proved by _Kesiah\r\nHarding_, a washerwoman at Slough, in December, 1844, and particularly\r\non the Monday week before her death, when he told the deceased that he\r\nwished her to be alone when he next came, and that he would come on the\r\nTuesday or Saturday week.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF PRUSSIC ACID BY TAWELL.\r\n\r\nThis was proved by _Henry Thomas_, shopman to a Mr. Hughes, a chemist\r\nin Bishopsgate Street, who said,\r\n\r\n “On the 1st of January, between twelve and two the prisoner came to\r\n the shop dressed in a great coat and usual quaker garb and asked for\r\n two drachms of Scheele’s Prussic Acid, bringing with him a ½oz.\r\n bottle with a regular label of Scheele’s Acid on it. As I could\r\n not get the stopper out, I gave it him in one of our own bottles.\r\n When about to put on a label, I believe the prisoner said “You need\r\n not,” but I would not swear it. He said he wanted it for an external\r\n application to varicose veins, paid 4_d._ for it, which was entered in\r\n the book now produced. Next day he came again between ten and two and\r\n asked for the same quantity, and, as he had broken our bottle, took it\r\n in the one he had originally brought. I had seen him frequently before\r\n and might have sold him prussic acid, but am not certain. He told me,\r\n three months before, that he had been a chemist and apothecary abroad.\r\n I do not remember his being in a hurry to catch the train and my being\r\n not able to get the stopper out. It is our practice to do it. We\r\n usually cover our bottles with leather. Attended at Aylesbury on the\r\n 13th of January, and recognised the prisoner the next morning in gaol.”\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of this witness, who was evidently favourable\r\nto the prisoner and in communication with his solicitor, was directed\r\nto three points—the suitability of prussic acid to the disease in the\r\nlegs from which the prisoner suffered; the effect of porter on the\r\nodour of prussic acid when mixed with it; and the amount that can be\r\nproduced from apple-pips.\r\n\r\n “The prisoner,” said the witness, “told me he was suffering from\r\n varicose veins. I judged that he was, from the medicine I sold him.\r\n He rubbed his leg. The prescription now shown me would be a good\r\n external application for the ulceration produced by varicose veins.”\r\n\r\n _Baron Parke._—“What is that?”\r\n\r\n _Kelly._—“Scheele’s Acid.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“That prescription is in the handwriting of Dr. Addison.\r\n I do not believe that Scheele’s Prussic Acid could be mixed with a\r\n drink and taken by a person and not smelt after death. _I do not think\r\n porter would disguise it._ I put about twenty drops of Scheele’s\r\n Prussic Acid down the throat of a parrot with a glass syringe. Three\r\n women were present, and the smell was so strong and suffocating,\r\n that it compelled them to leave the room. The bird was afterwards\r\n stuffed. _I mixed thirty drops of this acid with eleven ounces of\r\n porter, and found the odour slightly perceptible. I did not perceive\r\n the difference when the froth was on and when there was none._ It is\r\n the property of prussic acid to give out a smell when volatilising.\r\n _Apple-pips contain prussic acid. I have assisted at the extracting it\r\n from fifteen small apples. The process was a soft-water bath, diluted\r\n sulphuric acid, and sulphate of iron._ TWO GRAINS AND A QUARTER OF\r\n CYANIDE OF SILVER WERE PRODUCED. _I did this under the direction of\r\n Dr. Lievesley, a lecturer at the London Hospital. In this process two\r\n sweet almonds were used._”[16]\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_ by _Serjeant Byles_ the witness admitted that\r\nhe made this experiment on the 9th of March at the request of the\r\nPrisoner’s solicitor, and that he had never made this experiment\r\nbefore; that he had been with Mr. Hughes only about a year and half,\r\nand was paid £80 a year, and that Dr. Lievesley provided the London\r\nPharmacopœia acid, and the porter. On being shown a leather or paper\r\ncovering of a small bottle that had been found in the ashes of the\r\ngrate in Mrs. Hart’s house, the witness declared that it could not be\r\nthe covering of the bottle that he had put on, as it was too small for\r\nleather.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF MRS. HART.\r\n\r\n_Sarah Bateman_ said that she knew Mrs. Hart six years ago, when\r\nemployed to nurse the Prisoner’s first wife, who soon after died. The\r\nwitness at that time observed that Mrs. Hart—then known as Hadler—was\r\nwith child, and the following statement was subsequently made by her\r\nwhen at tea with Tawell and the witness.\r\n\r\n “I am in the family way, and will vindicate my master in it. He is\r\n going to be married to Sarah Catforth (the present wife), ‘and if\r\n it was to get abroad it would make a great difference to him.’ She\r\n seemed much excited, and Tawell begged her not to excite herself. ‘He\r\n was about to be admitted into the Society of Friends,’ he said, ‘and\r\n should not like these things to get abroad.’ She said, ‘He could marry\r\n Miss Catforth, and no one, not even her mother, should know what had\r\n become of her.’”\r\n\r\n_Mary Ann Moss_, of Crawford Street, Bryanston Square, with whom\r\nMrs. Hart came to lodge in 1841, when she was confined of a girl,\r\nremembered Tawell frequently visiting her, as Mrs. Hart said, “to\r\nbring her money from her husband.” From there she removed to a small\r\nhouse on Paddington Green for the sake of privacy, where Tawell paid\r\nregular visits, and eventually to Salt Hill, at Tawell’s desire. She\r\nrepresented to this witness that her husband was Tawell’s son, that\r\nTawell disapproved of the marriage, and that the girl and a boy of whom\r\nshe had been subsequently delivered were his. Mrs. Hart’s mother, Mrs.\r\nHadler, also spoke to her having not heard of her for several years.\r\n\r\nWith the proof by a clerk of Barnet’s Bank that Tawell had drawn a\r\ncheque for £14 on the 1st of January, and the identification of certain\r\nletters being in his handwriting, the case for the prosecution was\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the defence opened by Mr. Fitzroy Kelly, in his long\r\nand eloquent address to the jury has already been indicated by his\r\ncross-examination of the medical witnesses, and was so fully commented\r\non by the learned judge in his charge to the jury that it is needless\r\nto reprint it. On its conclusion residents at Berkhampstead who had\r\nknown him for several years, testified to the good character which he\r\nhad borne for kindness, charity, and benevolence, and a Mr. Richards,\r\nof Dover, and a Captain Dillon, who had both known him abroad—the\r\nlatter for nearly thirty years—gave similar evidence of his kind,\r\ncharitable, and hospitable disposition. On the conclusion of this\r\nevidence Baron Parke adjourned the Court to the next morning, when he\r\ngave the following exhaustive charge to the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGE’S CHARGE.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual introductory caution to the _Jury_ to be strictly\r\nimpartial, _Baron Parke_ said:—\r\n\r\n “He would next tell them what the case was, and how it was to be\r\n proved. It was to be proved by circumstantial evidence—the only\r\n sort of evidence that could be obtained in most cases of a similar\r\n nature. The most atrocious crimes were committed in secret, but\r\n Providence had so ordered it that some traces were frequently left\r\n which were sufficient to lead to the discovery of the perpetrators.\r\n The law, therefore, wisely provided that direct proof of crime was not\r\n absolutely necessary; but on the other hand it was equally necessary\r\n that by circumstantial evidence the case should be so fully made out\r\n as to leave no rational doubt of its committal. He should, therefore,\r\n advise them to lay down the rule, that they should first consider what\r\n had been proved to their satisfaction, and then whether all those\r\n facts were consistent with the guilt of the prisoner. If they thought\r\n that they were consistent with his guilt—and there was nothing\r\n inconsistent with it except the prisoner’s previous character—then\r\n they should consider whether they were inconsistent with his\r\n innocence, and they should remember that the existence of the crime\r\n was not inconsistent with the other parts of the case. Whilst on this\r\n part of the case, he should observe that the counsel for the prisoner\r\n had admitted all those facts, but had asserted that the law required\r\n not only that those facts should be proved, but that it should be\r\n shown directly that the deceased had died from poison, and that a\r\n sufficient quantity of poison to cause death had been found in her\r\n stomach. _That was not true of the law._ It was not necessary to give\r\n direct and positive evidence in every step of the case. There was no\r\n difference between direct and circumstantial evidence, if the evidence\r\n was sufficient to satisfy their minds that death had ensued from\r\n poison. It was not necessary to prove what quantity of that poison\r\n was necessary to produce death by the testimony of the person who had\r\n actually seen death produced by it; nor was it necessary to prove that\r\n such a quantity as would destroy life was actually found in the body.\r\n If they were satisfied that the prisoner administered poison to the\r\n deceased, and that she died of it, it was not necessary to prove what\r\n quantity had been administered to her. The only positive fact which\r\n the law required to be proved was the finding of the body, where such\r\n was possible. The body of the deceased having been found, it was to be\r\n considered whether the prisoner administered poison to her—whether it\r\n had been administered to her by the prisoner or by herself. The only\r\n allegation that she had done so was that of the prisoner himself, and\r\n if the jury thought the extraordinary story told by him was worthy\r\n of credit, it would agree with the latter mode of accounting for her\r\n death. But if they did not believe it, they had no other conclusion\r\n left than that he had committed the crime imputed to him.”\r\n\r\nThe learned judge then proceeded to comment on the evidence of Mrs.\r\nAshley, and others, who deposed to the perfect health and good\r\nspirits of the deceased up to a few minutes of the discovery of her\r\nlifeless body, and to the medical evidence of the perfect state of her\r\ninternal bodily organs, leaving no doubt that she had not died from\r\nnatural causes. He then went to the evidence of Messrs. Champneys and\r\nPickering, the surgeons, who, on opening the body of the deceased on\r\nthe day following her death smelt the odour of the prussic acid.[17]\r\n“There, then,” he said, “was evidence at once of the presence of\r\nprussic acid in the stomach on the day following a sudden death\r\naccompanied by appearances, such as would be symptomatic of sudden\r\ndeath from that powerful poison. Mr. Cooper, the chemist, analysed\r\nthe contents of the stomach subsequently and obtained a quantity of\r\npure Prussian blue from it, and before he proceeded further with\r\nthe evidence on this point, he would observe, that the jury should\r\nnever lose sight of the conduct of the prisoner during the whole of\r\nthe proceedings. He then proceeded to comment on the evidence of the\r\npresence of prussic acid in the stomach immediately after death, and\r\nthe allegation of the Prisoner’s counsel, that it was producible from\r\napples, and that it might have been produced from natural causes in\r\nthe stomach, which contained a quantity of apple pulp. He pointed out\r\nthat from all the medical evidence, it was proved that, that acid\r\nwas contained not in the apple, but in the pip, and that pips were\r\nnot found in the pulp in the deceased’s stomach. It was also proved\r\nthat prussic acid had been obtained from the pips themselves only by\r\na process of distillation, and was not produced by the mere natural\r\nprocess of digestion.[18] No one would die from eating apple pips,\r\nalthough a person might be killed by the prussic acid obtained from\r\nthem by a chemist. Besides, the action of the acid was sudden and\r\nimmediate, and the deceased had died in the manner she would have done\r\nafter suddenly swallowing some.”\r\n\r\nWith respect to the evidence regarding the odour of the acid being\r\nperceptible under this or that circumstance, said the Judge:—\r\n\r\n “All that could be inferred was, that though the perception of it was\r\n a positive proof of its presence, the non-perception was no proof\r\n of its not being present. As to the deceased having died from water\r\n having been poured down her throat, it was quite idle to attribute it\r\n to that. At that moment she was not living: death had already done its\r\n work. With regard to the quantity of prussic acid requisite to kill a\r\n human being, it had been proved that less than a grain would kill in\r\n some cases, as appeared by the melancholy cases so frequently referred\r\n to of the seven epileptic patients in Paris; and Mr. Cooper had proved\r\n that more than a grain existed in the stomach of the deceased. It was\r\n said that the experiments were not satisfactorily conducted—that was\r\n a question for the jury.\r\n\r\n “In considering the conduct of the prisoner, the jury must couple it\r\n with all the other evidence, in order to judge how far it bore out or\r\n contradicted the inferences that might be derived from it. It appeared\r\n that on the day in question the prisoner had gone to the Paddington\r\n station of the Great Western Railway and taken his place for Slough.\r\n He had left his great coat at the Jerusalem coffee-house, and told the\r\n waiter that he was going to dine at the West End of town. That was\r\n untrue, and he must have made that false statement for some object or\r\n other. He went down to Slough at five o’clock, and between six and\r\n seven Mrs. Ashley went round to the deceased’s house, in consequence\r\n of the noise she heard of stifled screaming. She met the prisoner in\r\n the garden in a state of agitation—so great that he could not undo\r\n the latch of the gate. She opened it for him. As to the observation\r\n she made about fearing that her neighbour was ill, she could not say\r\n that the prisoner heard it, and therefore it went for nothing. Let\r\n that pass. However, after she got in at the door of the deceased’s\r\n house, she turned round and saw the prisoner looking at her, and such\r\n was the effect upon her that she felt alarmed, and closed and fastened\r\n the door. At seven o’clock the prisoner was seen by a postboy, and he\r\n was then making towards the station. At ten minutes after seven he\r\n was at the station. He was next seen getting into the Eton omnibus,\r\n and asking to be set down at Herschel House. What his intention was\r\n in going to Herschel House does not appear. He was traced back again\r\n to the station, and an alarm having been given, a signal was made by\r\n the electric telegraph, and he was seen to alight from the railway\r\n carriage at Paddington, and was then traced home. When he was taken up\r\n next morning, and told what he was taken for, his answer was, that he\r\n knew no one at Slough. It had been suggested by his counsel that this\r\n was strictly true, as the deceased did not live exactly at Slough, but\r\n a little distance from it. It had also been suggested that he wished\r\n to prevent his wife hearing of his improper connection. It would be\r\n for the jury to say what degree of weight should be given to these\r\n explanations.\r\n\r\n “He had told several falsehoods when informed of the nature of\r\n the charge. On the Friday, about one o’clock, the prisoner had an\r\n interview with his legal adviser, and after that, but not until after\r\n that, did he make any attempt at explanation or give any account\r\n of what had taken place; and the account which he then gave was\r\n the extraordinary statement of her self-destruction. Here, then,\r\n the prisoner represented himself as present when the poison was\r\n administered, and as it was found in her stomach, it was for the jury\r\n to say whether the question did not amount to the simple one, of\r\n whether she had destroyed herself or the prisoner had administered\r\n it. If he thought she had been threatening to poison herself, he\r\n should at least have stayed to see what would be the effect upon her.\r\n The jury would next observe, keeping the prisoner’s story in mind,\r\n that no such vial as that described by him was found in the house.\r\n It had been proved by Mr. Thomas, who had sold him the poison in the\r\n morning, that the prisoner had prussic acid in his possession that\r\n day. He (the judge) did not give much weight to the observation that\r\n he would not have gone back the next day to the same shop for more if\r\n he were conscious of guilt, because in cases of murder, and especially\r\n of murder by poison, it was found that great precautions were not\r\n used. The perpetrators did not at all expect to be found out. As to\r\n the medicinal use alleged to have been made by the prisoner of the\r\n deadly poison, he might have had varicose veins; but at all events it\r\n had been shown that he had poison in his possession—he had the means\r\n of doing this act on the day it was committed.”\r\n\r\nComing then to the question of motive the Judge gave a brief history\r\nof the connection between the prisoner and the deceased, and,\r\nafter detailing its commencement, commented on it as showing her\r\nextraordinary affection and devotion to the prisoner.\r\n\r\n“With striking self-devotion,” said Baron Parke, “she had said, that,\r\nin order not to prevent the union of the prisoner with the lady to whom\r\nhe was about to be married, she would go out of the world, and be dead\r\nto the world, even to her own mother, from that day forth; and the\r\njury had heard from that very mother that from that time she had never\r\nheard of her unfortunate daughter until after her death. She kept her\r\npromise. She did go out of the world, and went from place to place till\r\nshe went to reside at Slough. It appeared that there she received from\r\nthe prisoner an allowance of £13 a quarter, and on the day in question\r\nit was seen that he was to have taken her her quarterly allowance. When\r\ntaken into custody, the sum of £12 10_s._, besides silver, was found in\r\nhis pocket; and it was proved that he had drawn a cheque for £14 that\r\nmorning. From that fact it might be inferred that he had gone down with\r\na sort of mixed feeling, either of paying her the money or, if he had\r\nthe opportunity of accomplishing his purpose, of poisoning her. But as\r\nto motive for destroying her, it had been suggested that no man would\r\ncommit such a dreadful crime for the sake of getting rid of expense.\r\nThat, he should say, was not a matter to be easily judged of.”\r\n\r\nHis Lordship then touched upon all the evidence regarding his alleged\r\npecuniary circumstances, and read the letter from his wife, in which\r\nallusion was made to his anxiety to have the papers from Sydney. “As to\r\nthe feeling appeal made upon that affectionate letter by his counsel,\r\nit only proved that the prisoner had been very kind to and enjoyed\r\nthe affection of his wife, which was not at all incompatible with the\r\ncommission of the crime with which he stood charged towards another\r\nwoman.”\r\n\r\nAs to the alleged previous attempt to poison the deceased in September\r\nlast, the Judge considered that there was no sufficient proof that he\r\nthen administered prussic acid to her. It was, however, remarkable that\r\nafter drinking porter with the prisoner on the 30th September, she\r\nshould have been so ill, and that after drinking porter with him on\r\nthe 1st of January she should have been taken ill and died. The strong\r\nfacts against the prisoner, in his opinion, “were his presence at the\r\nwoman’s house at the time she died; his declarations before and after\r\nhis arrest, and the fact that prussic acid was found in her stomach.”\r\n\r\nThe Judge then read over the whole of the material evidence, and, with\r\nthe usual caution, left the case in the hands of the jury. On Mr.\r\nGunning reminding him of the evidence to the prisoner’s character which\r\nhad been produced, Baron Parke said—“Such evidence was admissible in\r\ncases of this kind, because it went to show the general impression\r\nof the habits and feelings of a person. The prisoner was reputed to\r\nbe a kind-hearted, benevolent man. It was admitted that he had been\r\ntransported for some offence, the nature of which they had not been\r\ntold, but it was said that it was not one to affect his character for\r\nkindness of disposition.” The Judge then read over the evidence to\r\ncharacter, and left it to the jury to decide in reference to its value\r\nto the prisoner in his present position.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the Judge’s charge, which lasted from eight in the\r\nmorning until half-past eleven, the Jury retired, and in about half\r\nan hour returned a verdict of Guilty. In a few impressive sentences,\r\nin which he spoke of the hypocrisy that had characterised the\r\nprisoner’s life in the assumption of the garb of a virtuous, peaceful,\r\nbenevolent, and religious body of persons, the Judge passed on him the\r\ndread sentence of the law, which he suffered on the 28th of March.\r\nPreviously to his execution Tawell handed a written confession to the\r\njail chaplain, that he committed the murder for fear that his wife\r\nshould discover his connection with the deceased, and that the previous\r\nattempt was not made with prussic acid. He never imagined that Sarah\r\nHart had spoken of him to her neighbours, to whom he believed that he\r\nwas personally unknown, and so more likely to escape detection.\r\n\r\nAt the Easter Quarter Sessions of the County, held subsequently to the\r\nexecution of Tawell, an ineffectual attempt was made by a section of\r\nthe magistrates to compel the jail chaplain to deliver to the visiting\r\njustices this written confession, which the chaplain refused to hand\r\nover, on the ground of its having been received under the seal of\r\nconfession, and on the promise that it should not be published. All\r\nthat was known of it rested on the statement of the governor of the\r\nprison, and the general admission of the chaplain that it was a full\r\nconfession of the prisoner’s guilt.\r\n\r\nA difficult legal question arose, after Tawell’s death, with reference\r\nto his Australian land, which the Crown re-granted to his widow and\r\nfamily, after its forfeiture by his conviction; whether this re-grant\r\nshould prevail over the claims of a previous purchaser, a retired\r\nauctioneer, who had houses on it, who alleged that he had purchased it\r\nfor a _bonâ fide_ consideration, under a sufficient power of attorney,\r\nexecuted before Tawell’s conviction. “The affixing the seal of the\r\ncolony to this grant by Sir W. Denison, created a serious difference\r\nbetween that governor and his chief minister, Mr. Cowper. The seal was\r\naffixed pursuant to the instructions of the Secretary of the Colonies,\r\nwho only acted in the matter in accordance with the opinion of the\r\nAttorney and Solicitor-General of England. A part of the sworn duty of\r\na colonial governor is to obey the instructions of the Secretary of\r\nState for the Colonies.”[19] The governor, therefore, sent his private\r\nsecretary for the great seal of the colony and himself executed the new\r\ndeed. On this being done the owners of the property found the ground\r\ncut from under their feet, and it never came before the law courts, but\r\nit is believed that some compromise was effected with the family of\r\nTawell, and so the matter ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF GEORGE BALL FOR POISONING HIS MOTHER WITH PRUSSIC ACID.\r\n\r\n _July, 1860_, HOME CIRCUIT, LEWES, _before_ COLERIDGE, CHIEF JUSTICE\r\n _of Common Pleas_. BARROW, _for the Prosecution_. SERJEANT BALLANTINE\r\n _for the Defence_.\r\n\r\nThis case, really of misadventure, is reported, briefly, as showing\r\nthe carelessness with which dangerous medicines may, no doubt most\r\nunintentionally, be administered even by professional men, the\r\nculpable ignorance in some of those chemists who deal in such deadly\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nThe accused, a medical man, but not in regular practice, had for\r\nsome time attended his mother, a very ailing old lady, and been in\r\nthe habit of giving her small doses of prussic acid, as a remedy for\r\nviolent attacks of vomiting to which she was subject. On the 11th\r\nof July in consequence, he purchased of a Mr. Moswell, a chemist in\r\nLewes, a drachm of Scheele’s prussic acid, equal to 60 “minims,” and\r\ngave her a dose of 4 “minims.” The result was favourable, and the old\r\nlady went for a walk. On her return, however, she again complained,\r\nand the accused administered another dose of prussic acid, evidently\r\nfrom its effects, a deadly quantity, as she hardly got to her bedroom\r\nbefore she became insensible, and died almost instantaneously. The\r\naccused believed he had given her only seven drops, the proper quantity\r\nto be given. That he gave her seven drops was not doubted, but that\r\nthe size of drops differ under circumstances as much as the strength\r\nof Scheele’s preparation of the acid, will be seen from the following\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Scrate_, a surgeon at Lewes (who was sent for by the accused,\r\nfound the lady dead and the accused apparently in a very distressed\r\nstate of mind), said:—\r\n\r\n “I asked what was the matter; and the accused said he had given her\r\n seven drops of prussic acid, and witness replied he must have given\r\n her more.”\r\n\r\n _Chief Justice._—“Would seven drops be sufficient to cause death?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Not according to my experience; it was the proper\r\n quantity to be given. The smallest quantity of prussic acid on record\r\n having caused death was of nine-tenths of a grain.”\r\n\r\n _Chief Justice._—“How many ‘minims’ would a ‘drop’ contain?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“That would depend upon how the drops were obtained from\r\n the bottle. If the cork was partly in, the drop would be larger than\r\n if it was carefully poured from the open neck of the bottle. Some\r\n medical men made use of one method and some of the other, but it was\r\n his practice not to rely on ‘drops,’ but to measure ‘minims.’”\r\n\r\n _To Mr. Barrow._—“With such a deadly poison as prussic acid I should\r\n say that it was not prudent for any medical man to rely on ‘drops,’\r\n but to measure ‘minims.’ The proper doses, as marked on all bottles\r\n of Scheele’s strength, to be administered were _one_, _two_, or the\r\n largest _three_ ‘minims.’ Scheele’s acid was not uniform in strength:\r\n sometimes it contained _four_, sometimes _five_, and sometimes as much\r\n as _six_ per cent.”\r\n\r\n _Chief Justice._—“Would not that amount to almost the difference\r\n between life and death?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It would make a very great difference certainly. Taylor\r\n and other eminent medical men have recommended that Scheele’s prussic\r\n acid should not be used, on account of the very great variation\r\n of strength. I myself always use that of the Pharmacopœia. But\r\n notwithstanding what has been written upon the subject by many eminent\r\n men, Scheele’s acid is generally used in the profession.”\r\n\r\n _Chief Justice._—“Supposing the acid to be of the highest strength\r\n you have mentioned, do you consider seven drops would have been\r\n sufficient to cause death?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I don’t believe they would.”\r\n\r\n _To Mr. Barrow._—“Six per cent. is an exceptional strength, but I\r\n should think that it would take seventeen minims of that strength to\r\n cause death.”\r\n\r\n _Chief Justice._—“What do you say is the difference between a ‘drop’\r\n and a ‘minim’?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“That would depend on the sort of ‘drop.’ The prisoner\r\n afterwards gave me a bottle which contained prussic acid. He told me\r\n he had given his mother _four_ minims, and 2·5 minims remained. I did\r\n not test the strength of what remained, but had no doubt the deceased\r\n died from the effects of prussic acid.”\r\n\r\n _To Serjeant Ballantine._—“There was a broken cork in the bottle when\r\n the accused gave it to me. In his opinion ‘seventeen minims’ was the\r\n smallest dose that would destroy life. It was very easy to destroy\r\n life when dropping the liquid from a bottle. When accused told him he\r\n had given seven drops, he understood that he had given three and a\r\n half minims. He had never heard of any instance in which the strength\r\n of Scheele’s acid had exceeded six per cent.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. C. H. Moswell_ (chemist in Lewes).—“On the 11th of July accused\r\n came to his shop and asked for some prussic acid. Gave him a drachm,\r\n which would contain sixty minims. Did not measure it, but gave what he\r\n considered a quarter of the bottle.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Serjeant Ballantine._—“As you say you really did\r\n not measure it, can you tell us how much prussic acid you really did\r\n give?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I cannot say to a drop. I am sure he had fifty drops.\r\n I consider a ‘drop’ and a ‘minim’ synonymous. I gave him about the\r\n quantity, but when prussic acid is dispensed by a medical man, he is,\r\n of course, careful as to the quantity he uses.”\r\n\r\n _Chief Justice._—“We have been told that a ‘drop’ contains two\r\n ‘minims,’ and this witness says he looks upon them as synonymous.”\r\n\r\n _Serjeant Ballantine._—“If you were told to give a patient so many\r\n ‘minims,’ should you give him so many ‘drops’?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n _Serjeant Ballantine._—“Can you tell us the strength of the prussic\r\n acid you sold?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I don’t know what the strength was—I should suppose\r\n about _four_ per cent.”\r\n\r\nCase for the prosecution closed.\r\n\r\nThe _Chief Justice_ called the attention of the Jury to the evidence\r\nand observed, that the fact of the cork being broken in the bottle and\r\ndefective was certainly an important matter for their consideration, as\r\nit admitted the possibility that the prussic acid might have escaped\r\nfrom the bottle accidentally, and then there was an absence of evidence\r\nthat an excessive dose had been administered by the accused.\r\n\r\nThe _Jury_ almost immediately returned a verdict of “Not Guilty.”\r\n\r\nIf the estimate of the witness Scrate is taken for the difference\r\nbetween a drop and a minim, and the second witness, Moswell, is correct\r\nin saying that he gave the accused at least 50 drops, equal to 25\r\nminims, as only 2·5 minims were left in the bottle, equal to 4¼ drops;\r\nin the two doses the accused must have administered more than 45 drops,\r\nequal to 22½ minims. If the cork was not broken in the bottle when the\r\nfirst dose was administered, the probability is that the dose then\r\ngiven did not exceed seven drops of the size that would make them equal\r\nto 3½ minims, thus leaving 19 minims for the second dose. It is to be\r\nregretted that the strength of the prussic acid was not tested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE ON TAWELL’S CASE.\r\n\r\nIn a case of the poisoning at Egglesham, near Glasgow, by prussic acid,\r\nof a young woman, of the name of Agnes Montgomery, by Peter Walker, a\r\ntailor, the symptoms were thus described by one of the witnesses, as\r\nwell as the effect of prussic acid on herself:—\r\n\r\n “After we learnt that the moaning came from Aggie’s room, we came up,\r\n got Clarkson’s key, and went in. (As in Tawell’s case, the prisoner\r\n had left the girl’s room only a few minutes before.) Aggie was sitting\r\n on a chair (in which it was probable from other evidence that she had\r\n been placed by her murderer), with her head leaning on the table.\r\n The body was quite still. There was a little froth coming out of the\r\n _wicks_ of her mouth. It was a little coloured with blood; and we\r\n afterwards found she had bit her tongue and her lips. She threw back\r\n at different times, as if in distress. Her right hand was very firmly\r\n closed. I loosed the boot of the left foot, and found it was swelled\r\n and quite stiff. About ten minutes after that was another groan: the\r\n breathing was slow, and with great oppression. She sighed six times\r\n before she died. Her skin was getting quite cold after we got her.\r\n I thought there was a little sweat on her face. We got hot water to\r\n bathe her arms. The eyes were large and staring. She died about three\r\n quarters of an hour after we got her. When we went into her room, I\r\n found a sickening smell. I felt in my nostrils a kind of nipping, and\r\n my throat was dry. I felt it off Aggie the moment I came forward. I\r\n know the smell of almonds, but can’t say it was exactly like that. On\r\n the 5th of November I saw the superintendent of police, and others,\r\n and saw something (it was prussic acid) put into beer. I smelt the\r\n beer; and after some of it was poured on the floor, I recognised it\r\n as the same smell. It affected me in the same way as before in the\r\n nostrils and throat.”—_Evidence of Mrs. M’Donald._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this case, on a _post-mortem_ examination of the exhumed body, the\r\npresence of prussic acid was clearly detected; and it was proved on the\r\ntrial that the prisoner had employed a carrier to get some prussic acid\r\nfor him, and that the bottle containing it had been given to him on the\r\nday of the murder; and the fragments of a glass phial were subsequently\r\ndiscovered, with the key of the girl’s room, at the root of a tree, at\r\nwhich the prisoner had been seen stopping, as he returned from going\r\nfor a doctor. In this case the poison had been most probably given in\r\nbeer, as in Tawell’s, a tumbler in which beer had been being found on\r\nthe girl’s table.\r\n\r\nThe fellow, two months afterwards, tried to poison a Mr. Mason and his\r\nwife, with whom he had gone to lodge in Glasgow, with prussic acid, but\r\nhappily failed in his attempt.\r\n\r\nHe confessed his guilt; and at first gave as his motive his desire to\r\npossess himself of the girl’s money, but subsequently said he could not\r\ntell what possessed him to do it. “Following so closely on the case of\r\nMadeleine Smith, the probability is that her case had had on him the\r\nsame effect as Palmer’s on Dove—exciting a morbid desire to tamper\r\nwith deadly drugs, and that the death of his victim, and the danger of\r\nthe others, was as much due to this feeling as the desire for plunder.”\r\nHe was discovered to have been transported for robbery, and to have\r\nbeen guilty of other crimes. He now confessed that he had murdered a\r\nlad, by pushing him into a quarry hole. He was executed at Paisley,\r\nJan. 14, 1858.—_Annual Register for 1858._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL NOTES.\r\n\r\nNOTE I.—HYDROCYANIC OR PRUSSIC ACID.\r\n\r\n Nature of—Strength of different preparations of, English and\r\n foreign—Where found—Tests, preliminary: (1) Odour—(2) Silver—(3)\r\n Prussian blue—(4) Sulphur—(5) Guaiacum—(6) Uranium—(7) Picric\r\n acid—(8) Cupric sulphate—(9) Cobalt chloride—(10) Mercuric\r\n oxide—(11) Peroxide of hydrogen—(12) Mercurous nitrate.

This change is\r\nsupposed to be retarded by a trace of mineral acid, hence a little\r\nhydrochloric or sulphuric acid is frequently added to the commercial\r\nsolution with this object. But the acid may even be _stronger_ than\r\nsupposed, as the methods of preparation are somewhat various, and the\r\none adopted may have been carelessly carried out. Scheele’s acid is\r\nsaid to be the most popular among medical men; samples of it obtained\r\nfrom different large firms and examined by the author showed very\r\nirregular strengths, the lowest being 2, and the highest 8 per cent.\r\nThe latter was purchased at the shop of a chemist who said he had\r\nmade it himself, and could guarantee it was of full strength. He had\r\nevidently made allowance for deterioration. Woodman and Tidy found 16\r\nsamples sold in one neighbourhood as B.P. acid to contain 0·6 to 3·2\r\nper cent. of HCN; others have found 0·25 per cent. not infrequent.\r\nIt follows that if, in a poison case, a bottle has been found of a\r\nhydrocyanic preparation of a definite name, or even with a certain\r\nstrength or dose marked on it, it will not be safe to trust to such\r\nfigures without actually determining the amount. In Ball’s trial\r\n(Lewes, 1860), the judge asked whether this variation in strength would\r\nnot make the difference between a medicinal and a poisonous dose?\r\nIt would not, as the maximum medicinal dose, 4 grains, of even the\r\nabnormally strong (8 per cent.) Scheele’s acid mentioned above, would\r\nonly contain 0·32 grain of anhydrous HCN, and it requires at least\r\nhalf a grain to cause death, while about 1 grain is the usual fatal\r\nquantity. And a medical man would not even give the maximum medicinal\r\ndose as a beginning, and without precaution.\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDUM HYDROCYANICUM DILUTUM, PHARMACOPŒIA BRITANNICA.\r\n\r\nWe shall use the abbreviation “B. P. 2 per cent.” for this acid, which\r\nhas the characteristic odour, a sp. gr. of ·997, and a taste “at first\r\nbland and sweet, ultimately pungent and acrid” (Thomson), “hot and\r\nbitter” (Taylor), “cooling, with pungent bitter aftertaste” (Watts).\r\nIf pure, it only slightly and transiently reddens litmus; if other\r\nacids have been added to keep it, it may have a stronger reddening\r\neffect. Also, if pure, it leaves no residue on platinum, and gives no\r\nprecipitate with barium chloride, but with silver nitrate it gives an\r\nimmediate white curdy precipitate of silver cyanide, not blackening\r\nin daylight as the chloride does, soluble in ammonia, insoluble in\r\ndilute, but soluble in hot concentrated nitric acid. It dissolves\r\nmercuric oxide, giving a mercuric cyanide which may be obtained in\r\nwhite crystals on evaporation. The vapour is said to be more deadly\r\nthan the fluid acid. The weaker the acid, the more permanent it is.\r\nGlycerine increases its stability (J. Williams); this might be useful\r\nif suspected substances had to be kept a long time.\r\n\r\n_Occurrence._—Hydrocyanic acid itself has never been found as a\r\nnatural constituent of the body, although a compound of cyanogen occurs\r\nin the saliva (_see_ Sulphocyanides). Hydrocyanic acid is not formed\r\nduring putrefaction, nor by heating organic substances with chemical\r\nreagents at temperatures up to 212° F., as in testing for poisons. The\r\nonly way in which it may be generated from animal matter is by heating\r\nwith alkalies _to a red heat_;[20] this cannot, of course, happen in\r\nthe ordinary process of testing for prussic acid, though it must be\r\nremembered that cyanide might thus be formed in an _ash_ (by burning),\r\nwithout having been present in the original substance.\r\n\r\nIt is rather frequent, however, in the vegetable kingdom, and\r\nconsequently in a poisoning case the defence often sets up the theory\r\nthat it has been ingested in the food (Tawell’s Trial, &c.). It is\r\nnecessary, therefore, to examine in what kind of food, and to what\r\namount, it may be taken.\r\n\r\nIts principal source is the seeds, leaves, and flowers, and sometimes\r\nthe bark, of most of the species of the sub-orders Amygdaleæ and Pomeæ\r\nof the natural order Rosaceæ. It does not occur in them ready-formed.\r\nThere is a substance called _Amygdalin_, a white bitterish crystalline\r\nbody, which may be extracted by alcohol from these plants. Amygdalin\r\nwhen dissolved by itself in water does not produce HCN, and is probably\r\nharmless, but there exists by its side in the plant a species of\r\nferment called _Emulsin_ or Synaptase, which has the power, when\r\nmacerated in water with amygdalin, of breaking up the latter into\r\nglucose (so-called grape-sugar), benzoyl hydride (oil of bitter\r\nalmonds), and hydrocyanic acid. In the plant the amygdalin apparently\r\nexists in cells apart from the emulsin, but by crushing in water, or\r\nmasticating in the mouth, the change is very rapidly effected. By\r\nlong soaking the same result may happen, as in cherry brandy; here\r\nthe diluted spirit dissolves the amygdalin, and the emulsin then may\r\nact. But if, in the stomach, the apple-pips or cherry-stones should be\r\nfound _whole_, it is almost impossible that the amygdalin should be\r\ndecomposed, protected as it is by its horny or stony envelope. Stones\r\nand pips, in fact, pass through the body intact, and are found in the\r\nfæces.\r\n\r\nYet as amygdalin and its decomposition may be much mentioned by the\r\ndefence, the following account may be useful.\r\n\r\n100 parts of amygdalin yield 6 parts HCN.\r\n\r\nIt has been found in the species of Rosaceæ given below, generally in\r\nfruit, flowers, leaves, sometimes bark, rarely root.\r\n\r\n_Pyrus_ malus (apple pips), domesticus (pear).\r\n\r\n_Prunus_ spinosa (sloe), avium (bird cherry), padus (wild service),\r\nVirginiana or serotina (wild black cherry), capricida, insititia\r\n(bullace), domestica (plum, damson, &c.).\r\n\r\n_Amygdalus_ communis (almond), Persica (peach), lævis (nectarine).\r\n\r\n_Armeniaca_ vulgaris (apricot).\r\n\r\n_Cerasus_ communis (cherry), acida, laurocerasus (cherry-laurel),\r\nLusitanica (Portugal laurel).\r\n\r\n_Cydonia_ vulgaris (quince).\r\n\r\n_Sorbus_ aucuparia (mountain ash), torminalis, hybrida.\r\n\r\n_Cratægus_ oxyacantha (hawthorn, young branches).\r\n\r\n_Spiræa_ aruncus, sorbifolia, japonica (not in herbaceous species).\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid, ready formed, has been found in the roots of the\r\nbitter and sweet cassava (Jatropha manihot).\r\n\r\nIf the poisonous dose of the B.

The pips of bitter apples are bigger, more\r\nnumerous, and weigh about three times as much as those of sweet apples.\r\n\r\nAmong substances containing much more HCN, and actually poisonous on\r\nthat account, are:—\r\n\r\n                                       HCN.\r\n  Crude bitter almond oil       8  to  15 per cent.\r\n  Bitter almond water           ¼  to   1    ”\r\n  Cherry laurel oil             2  to   3    ”\r\n     ”      ”   water[21]       ¼  to   ¾    ”\r\n  Cluster cherry oil            9  to  10    ”\r\n\r\n(Allen, Comm. Org. Anal.) It is obvious that of fruits an impossibly\r\nlarge quantity must be eaten to produce any considerable amount of HCN.\r\nIn Tawell’s trial, Mr. Cooper, the analyst, deposed that the seeds from\r\n15 apples gave him an exceedingly small quantity of Prussian blue.\r\nWhereas, Henry Thomas, a druggist’s assistant, stated that “15 small\r\napples gave 2¼ grains of silver cyanide” [equal to 0·46, or nearly ½\r\na grain, of anhydrous HCN, corresponding to 25 minims of B. P. acid,\r\nnearly a poisonous dose!] “This was done under the direction of a\r\nlecturer at the London Hospital.” A fair sample of the erroneous and\r\nbewildering evidence that is frequently offered in courts of justice.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper also stated “there is a great difference between bitter and\r\nsweet apples; the bitter contain a great deal of prussic acid, the\r\nsweet, I believe, none at all!” This statement is misleading; no apples\r\n_contain_ prussic acid, but all that I have met with will _yield_ it\r\nby maceration, as all contain amygdalin. The highest class of eating\r\napples, such as Newtown pippins, Ribstones, and Blenheims, contain only\r\na minute trace. These have very few pips, 3 to 5 to each apple, while\r\nthe bitter varieties, such as “winesours,” have 9 to 13 pips.\r\n\r\nIn the arts, cyanides are used in photography, dyeing, cleaning\r\nlace and metals, electro-plating, removing silver stains, &c. Their\r\nsolutions may cause accidental poisoning, either by the fumes or by\r\nabsorption through the skin, especially if the latter is abraded.\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid is also formed (1) in the preparation of nitrous ether\r\n(sweet spirit of nitre), (2) by distilling albumen, fibrin, casein, or\r\ngelatin, with sulphuric acid and bichromate of potash, or manganese\r\nperoxide, (3) by the dry distillation of albuminous bodies. It is\r\nhardly necessary to say that these formations could not occur in the\r\nordinary methods of testing.\r\n\r\nTESTS: PRELIMINARY.—It cannot be too strongly insisted that all\r\noperations for the detection of HCN should be carried out as soon after\r\ndeath as possible, on account of the loss from volatility, or from\r\nsecondary changes. (See Sulphocyanides.)\r\n\r\nAllen asserts (Commercial Organic Analysis, 1879), that detection in\r\nthe body is rarely possible more than twenty-four hours after death;\r\nbut Taylor (Med. Juris., 1873, p. 368) has found it in the stomach\r\ntwelve days after, saying, however, that “after the stomach had been\r\nexposed a few days longer, all had disappeared.” In a dog’s stomach he\r\nfound it, after twenty-four hours’ exposure, _and washing with water_.\r\nIn a human stomach, success was achieved seven days after death, where\r\nno odour was perceptible; in another case, after twenty-two days in\r\nthe stomach, and after two months in the spleen. It may be found in\r\nthe stomach, and not in the tissues; but in most cases it is easily\r\ndetected, soon after death, in the blood, organs, &c. The vapour of\r\nHCN will traverse paper, wet or dry bladder, &c., in a few minutes\r\n(Taylor), and few stoppers are close enough to retain it. Hence care\r\nshould be taken to shut up the suspected matters at once in glass\r\nbottles _accurately stoppered_; bad stoppers are worse than corks.\r\n\r\nThe stomach should be first examined entire, to ascertain _odour_,\r\n&c., _noticing whether alkaline or acid_, then cut in pieces, under\r\ndistilled water sufficient to cover it, the whole measured, and\r\none-half (acidulated with tartaric acid, if alkaline), placed in a\r\ncapacious retort, and distilled in a bath of water saturated with salt\r\nto raise the boiling point. The condenser should be well supplied with\r\ncold water, the receiver attached airtight, with a mercury valve (a\r\nnarrow glass U-tube, containing mercury), to prevent undue pressure. A\r\nlittle distilled water, about ½ oz., should be placed in the receiver.\r\nThe distillation should be continued till one-third to one-half of the\r\noriginal liquid has passed over. The tests may then be applied to the\r\ndistillate.\r\n\r\nAllen recommends us to distil _with water alone_ about one-half. If\r\nthere is no result on testing the distillate, continue with addition of\r\ntartaric acid. Finally, add a considerable excess of moderately dilute\r\nsulphuric _and_ hydrochloric acid, and carry the distillation nearly\r\nto dryness. In the last stage sulpho-, ferro-and ferricyanides and\r\nmercuric cyanide are decomposed, and give HCN. The original should be\r\ntested for ferrocyanide, &c. This seems a process calculated to give\r\nthe clearest idea of the form in which the HCN is present, but is open\r\nto the objection that it is protracted, and may hence cause loss.\r\n\r\nSokoloff. (Chem. Centr., 1876, 603) advises a much more heroic\r\ntreatment. “Strongly acidify with sulphuric acid, and distil over\r\na water bath for _two or three days_, replenishing the water as\r\nevaporated. The longer the distillation, the more accurate the result.”\r\nHe adds, that the muscles contain the greater part of the HCN. He\r\nquotes figures in support of his results, but I have not found such\r\nprolongation necessary; and we must remember that HCN is decomposed by\r\nheating with moderately strong mineral acids.\r\n\r\nThe following modification, proposed by the author, may be\r\nadvantageous, as diminishing the risk of loss, and also effecting\r\nconcentration:—Prepare _exactly_ equivalent solutions of silver\r\nnitrate, and hydrochloric acid: the silver solution may contain 17\r\ngrammes of silver nitrate, the hydrochloric solution 3·65 grammes\r\nof hydric chloride, per litre. Place in the receiver 100 cubic\r\ncentimetres of the silver solution (= 1·70 gramme silver nitrate)\r\nbefore distillation. This is allowing large excess, to provide for\r\nexceptional quantities of HCN. If any quantity of HCN be present, the\r\nliquid in the receiver will become milky; if it does not, there cannot\r\nbe more than a minute trace. Transfer the distillate and washings to\r\na retort, provided with a thistle-funnel, and boil down to one-third\r\nof its bulk; then add, through the funnel, 100 cubic centimetres of\r\nthe hydric chloride solution, which will precipitate all the silver\r\nas chloride, and liberate the HCN. Distill with the same precautions\r\nas before: the first 25 cubic centimetres will contain probably all\r\nthe HCN. If doubted, a further quantity may be collected and tested.\r\nThe 25 cubic centimetres of distillate may now be subjected to the\r\nfollowing tests, taking care that each portion is _measured_ before\r\nbeing examined, in order that the idea of the quantity present may be\r\ndefinite. For instance, in the Prussian blue, and sulphocyanide tests,\r\nthe resulting colour may be imitated by standard solutions: in the\r\nsilver test, a standard silver solution should also be used, and thus a\r\ntriply-confirmed knowledge of the quantity present may be attained; and\r\nlittle bottles, containing the results, should be preserved, to show in\r\nthe courts of justice.\r\n\r\nI. ODOUR.—All tests involving odour are affected seriously by the\r\nremarkable differences between different people as to their sense of\r\nsmell. We hear much of “colour-blindness;” but the analogous olfactory\r\ndefect has almost escaped remark. Yet “smell-blindness,” as I have\r\nformerly christened it, or “anozism,” if a Greek word be required,\r\nis exceedingly common, and chemists and medical men are frequently\r\nafflicted with it. I have known an artist, who could not smell strong\r\nammonia, yet delighted in the odour of new paint, which he compared\r\nto roses. Many laboratory students can neither smell acetic acid,\r\narseniuretted hydrogen, nor cyanogen. An assistant was so fond of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, that he was once found insensible beside the\r\napparatus, having narcotized himself with the gas (he recovered);\r\nand many more such eccentricities. In the case of prussic acid these\r\ndiversities are enormous. Some are so sensitive, that the least trace\r\nin a room becomes rapidly unbearable, causing headache and nausea;\r\nothers are like photographers, and can work in a heavily-cyanogened\r\natmosphere. Such idiosyncrasies become of great importance in evidence;\r\nfor example:—\r\n\r\nIn Tawell’s trial, Mr. Champneys, surgeon, testified as follows: “Have\r\nno experience in detecting odour of prussic acid in a human subject.\r\nShould think it may be taken without detection. Should expect it in the\r\nmouth and breath, but there may be exceptions. There was no odour in\r\nher [the deceased’s] breath; but, on opening the body, I was positive\r\nI smelt prussic acid. The other two surgeons could not smell it.”\r\nAfterwards, when the contents of the stomach were transferred to a jar,\r\nneither the three surgeons, nor Mr. Cooper, the analyst, could perceive\r\nthe least odour of prussic acid, even when the contents were boiled.\r\nNor was it smelt in the blood. Mr. Cooper subsequently stated: “I have\r\nno doubt that prussic acid may exist without being smelt: absence of\r\nsmell may arise from dilution, or from its being covered by the smell\r\nof other substances. When I smell it, it affects spasmodically the back\r\nof the throat. _Sometimes it has produced a spasmodic constriction\r\nabout the throat without my smelling it._” Here was a well-marked case\r\nof intermittent smell-blindness.\r\n\r\nThere were also several questions as to whether prussic acid might\r\nhave existed in the form of an inodorous salt. Mr. Champneys further\r\nstated that he put ½ drachm of prussic acid into a tumbler filled\r\nwith Guinness’s porter, and the smell was _scarcely perceptible_. Mr.\r\nNorblad, surgeon, deposed that he mixed 12 grains of prussic acid with\r\na pint of porter, but could not then smell it. “Some of the porter\r\ndropped on the table, and I did then smell it.” In the same trial,\r\nHenry Thomas, druggist’s assistant, mixed 30 drops of B.P. prussic\r\nacid with 11 oz. of porter, and found the odour of the acid _slightly\r\nperceptible_; yet, when he was pouring Scheele’s acid from a bottle,\r\nthree women had to leave the room to avoid suffocation!\r\n\r\nIn a case of suicide by cyanide of potassium (Chem. News, 1861, p.\r\n261), the smell of prussic acid was not perceived by the surgeon,\r\neither immediately after death or at the post-mortem examination,\r\nnor by the analyst until the contents had been distilled with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nTo help in elucidating this matter I have made some experiments as to\r\nthe detection of the odour of prussic acid. An acid of 2 per cent.\r\nstrength (B.P.) was used.\r\n\r\n1. From a bottle of Guinness’s stout, freshly opened, 3 samples of\r\n1 fluid oz. each were measured. To the first 1 drop of the acid was\r\nadded, to the second 2 drops, the third being left untouched. This was\r\ndone out of my sight in another room. They were then privately marked\r\nby an assistant, and brought in; when myself and two others, one of\r\nthem entirely inexperienced, independently and at once classified them\r\nwithout hesitation correctly as to the relative _amounts_ of prussic\r\nacid. The odour was so distinct as to produce, when inhaled, a feeling\r\nof oppression, and to _quite overpower the odour of the beer_.\r\n\r\n  1 drop in 1 fl. oz. = 0·23 per cent. of the dilute (B.P.) acid.\r\n          ”           =  ·0046 per cent. of real anhydrous HCN.\r\n\r\nAbout 1/30 of a poisonous dose. Hence if a poisonous dose were put into\r\na pint and a half of stout, the odour would be distinct.\r\n\r\n2. One drop of the dilute (2 per cent.) acid was added to 6 oz.\r\nstout: there resulted a slight but distinct odour of prussic acid.\r\nHence a poisonous dose in _nine pints_ would be smelt. Covered by a\r\nwatch-glass, with a drop of yellow ammonium sulphide on it, it was\r\nwarmed; the drop, on evaporation, gave a distinct red sulphocyanide\r\nreaction with ferric chloride. Exposed to the air for twenty-four\r\nhours, all the above samples had lost their odour, and failed to give\r\nthe sulphocyanide reaction.\r\n\r\n3. Two samples of urine, measuring ½ pint each, were treated\r\nrespectively with 1 and 2 drops of B.P. acid (strength in this case\r\n1·18 per cent. HCN), and a third ½ pint left untouched, the same\r\nprecautions being used as with the above beers. Three independent\r\nwitnesses again classified them without difficulty as to relative\r\namounts of the poison. This is 2 drops of an exceptionally weak acid to\r\nthe pint.\r\n\r\n4. The contents of a human stomach, very fetid from decomposition, were\r\ndivided into two portions of about 2 oz. each: one was left untouched;\r\nto the other 1 grain of mercuric cyanide was added, and then about\r\n5 drops of hydrochloric acid, and a little zinc dust. The whole was\r\nwell stirred, and shut up close. Next day the odour of HCN was very\r\nprominent in the one to which the cyanide had been added, in spite of\r\nthe strong original smell of both.\r\n\r\n5. I cannot agree with Taylor that either peppermint or tobacco mask\r\nthe odour appreciably.\r\n\r\nThe odour of _nitrobenzol_, being similar to that of bitter almonds,\r\nmight lead to a suspicion of prussic acid without due caution (Woodman\r\nand Tidy).\r\n\r\nIn putrefying, organic matters often develope ammonium sulphide,\r\nbecoming alkaline. The ammonium sulphide would combine with the HCN\r\nto form sulphocyanide of ammonium, _which is inodorous_, but, by\r\ndistillation with acids, gives HCN. Sulphocyanide, however, could not\r\nbe produced _unless the original matters were alkaline_. In Tawell’s,\r\nand most other trials, the stomach contents were _acid_, as they always\r\nare naturally from the gastric juice.\r\n\r\nTaylor (Med. Jurisprudence, 1873, vol. i., p. 364) mentions a case\r\nwhere the blood had a strong odour of prussic acid, and the mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach, _even after it had been washed three times\r\nwith water_, also exhaled a strong odour. In another case (Med. Gaz.,\r\nvol. xxxvi., p. 104), where 20 grains of Scheele’s acid had been taken\r\nwith ultimate recovery, the vomited matters had _no odour_, “showing\r\nthat, if not concealed by other odours, the whole of the acid must\r\nhave been absorbed.” Many other instances might be quoted where nothing\r\nwas smelt, and yet the tests revealed prussic acid.\r\n\r\nAs to the question about the _salts_ of prussic acid, it may be\r\ngenerally said that all poisonous cyanides would smell in the stomach,\r\nexcept, perhaps, mercuric cyanide. _See_ “Properties of the Salts,”\r\np. 73. Possibly the formation of mercuric cyanide may have accounted\r\nfor the absence of odour in some of the above cases, as I do not find\r\nthat mercury was tested for, though its compounds are common medicines.\r\nOtherwise it is hardly possible that hydrocyanic poisoning should\r\nhave been effected, and the acid be still there, without its very\r\ncharacteristic odour being perceptible to an observer with an acute\r\nolfactory sense. I have entered at some length into the question of\r\nodour, as much importance has been attached to it in the trials, and I\r\nstill consider it as one of the most delicate and positive of tests.\r\n\r\nII. SILVER TEST.—When silver nitrate is added to a solution containing\r\nHCN or a cyanide acidulated with nitric acid, a white precipitate\r\nfalls of silver cyanide, soluble in ammonia, insoluble in dilute, but\r\nsoluble in hot concentrated nitric acid, and not blackened by light.\r\nThis reaction is rendered quantitative according to Liebig’s volumetric\r\nmethod. The original solution is made slightly alkaline by potash, and\r\na standard solution containing 1·7 grammes of silver nitrate per litre\r\n(1 cub. centimetre = ·0017 grm. AgNO_{3}) is added until a permanent\r\nwhite turbidity is produced, seen best over a sheet of black paper\r\nor a black book. Then each cub. centimetre used is equivalent to a\r\n_double_ quantity or ·00054 grammes of HCN. Formic acid, or chlorides,\r\ndo not interfere; in fact, it is advantageous to have a little chloride\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe silver cyanide may be also estimated _gravimetrically_ by adding\r\nexcess of silver nitrate, collecting the precipitate on a weighed\r\nfilter, washing, drying, and weighing. Silver cyanide corresponds\r\nto two-tenths of its weight of HCN (134 gives 27). If chlorides be\r\npresent, the mixed precipitate of silver cyanide and chloride is\r\nweighed, treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, and weighed again.\r\nThe HCN is thus displaced, and passes into the filtrate; the silver\r\nprecipitate, now all as chloride, is weighed again: then the increase\r\nof weight multiplied by 27 and divided by 9·5 (the difference between\r\nthe equivalent weights of silver chloride and cyanide) is equal to\r\nthe _weight_ of HCN present. But the volumetric process is quite as\r\naccurate, and more expeditious.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning cases advantage is taken of the opacity of silver cyanide\r\nthus: A drop of moderately dilute silver nitrate is placed on a\r\nwatch-glass over the substance, which may be gently warmed, taking\r\ncare that the steam condensed does not cause the drop to fall. If\r\nHCN be present, the drop will become opaque-white from formation of\r\nsilver cyanide. 1/100 grain of HCN, equal to ¼ grain of B.P. acid, will\r\ngive this reaction (Taylor). If there is only a small amount, and the\r\naction is gradual, the drop on drying in the air may exhibit crystals\r\nof silver cyanide, recognizable under the microscope as minute prisms\r\nobliquely truncated. Of course the silver nitrate itself may give\r\ncrystals, but they will be very soluble in water.\r\n\r\nCyanide of silver is decomposed by (1) hydrochloric acid, giving\r\nsilver chloride; (2) dilute sulphuric acid and zinc, giving silver;\r\n(3) sulphuretted hydrogen, giving silver sulphide; in each case HCN is\r\nliberated and may be distilled off: then the other tests may be applied.\r\n\r\nIf sulphuretted hydrogen be present, it will give a _black_ with silver\r\nnitrate. The liquid should in this case be previously shaken with just\r\nenough carbonate of lead to remove the sulphuretted hydrogen. The\r\nlatter, however, does not interfere with the Prussian blue or sulphur\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficient in quantity, the cyanide of silver, thoroughly dried\r\nin a water-bath, may be transferred to a small bulb-tube and heated,\r\nthe end being closed with the finger. It breaks up into cyanogen gas,\r\nsilver, and paracyanide of silver, a peculiar glow and effervescence\r\noccurring as it decomposes. The cyanogen will have the characteristic\r\nbitter almond odour, and, on removing the finger, will burn with a\r\nflame violet on the margin and rosy in the centre.\r\n\r\nIII. PRUSSIAN BLUE (Scheele).—Add to the solution or distillate\r\ncaustic potash in excess, then a drop or two of fresh ferrous sulphate\r\n(protosulphate of iron), and a little ferric chloride (perchloride\r\nof iron—the tinct. ferri perchlor. of the Pharmacopœia will do),\r\nwarm gently for a few minutes, add dilute hydrochloric acid in slight\r\nexcess: if much HCN be present, a deep blue precipitate (Prussian blue)\r\nwill remain; if only a trace, the liquid will be greenish, and on\r\nstanding till the next day a blue deposit will form.[22] This is the\r\nonly _blue_ iron precipitate which is insoluble in dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid.[23]\r\n\r\n_Remarks._—Sulphuretted hydrogen does not interfere with this test,\r\nas the black ferrous sulphide dissolves in hydrochloric acid. The\r\namount of iron salts added should have some relation to the amount\r\nof HCN present, an idea of which will have been attained by the\r\nsilver test. Moderate excess of potash must be present all the time\r\ntill the hydrochloric acid is added. A large amount of iron salt is\r\nobjectionable, as the yellow colour interferes with the final green\r\ntint with traces of HCN. The test may be made quantitative by imitating\r\nthe tint with a weak standard solution of potassium ferrocyanide\r\ntreated with a drop of hydrochloric acid and a drop of ferric chloride,\r\non the same principle as “_Nesslerizing_” (see Wanklyn’s Water\r\nAnalysis). Finally the precipitate of Prussian blue should be preserved\r\nto exhibit at the trial, as this is the most positive, though not the\r\nmost delicate, test.\r\n\r\nIV. SULPHUR TEST (Liebig).—The liquid to be examined is placed in a\r\nsomewhat shallow glass dish or beaker, covered almost airtight with\r\na watch-glass, moistened on the under surface with a drop or two of\r\n_yellow_ ammonium sulphide. [The ordinary sulphide is commonly yellow\r\nenough for the purpose, or, if not, can be made so by warming with a\r\nlittle flowers of sulphur.] After warming gently for a short time (the\r\nperiods recommended by different authorities vary from half a minute to\r\nten minutes), great care being taken that the steam does not condense\r\nand cause the solution on the watch-glass to drop back into the liquid,\r\nthe cover is removed, dried on a water bath to drive off any excess\r\nof ammonium sulphide, treated with a drop or two of water, and a drop\r\nof not too acid ferric chloride free from nitric acid and diluted\r\ntill nearly free from colour. If HCN be present, it will have formed\r\nsulphocyanide with the ammonium sulphide, and will therefore generate\r\na blood-red colour with the ferric chloride. If a colour be produced,\r\ncontinue the addition of ferric chloride till no further deepening\r\noccurs. The reaction is made quantitative by comparing the tint with\r\nthat produced by a known quantity of sulphocyanide and ferric solution\r\n(Herapath). But there are difficulties in making it exact.\r\n\r\nThis is the most delicate test for HCN, detecting 1/7930th of a\r\ngrain of HCN in a very dilute liquid, whereas Prussian blue does not\r\ndiscover less than 1/780th of a grain (Taylor, Ann. Ch. Pharm. lxv.,\r\n263). Salts of acetic, formic, and meconic acids give red colours with\r\nferric chloride, but (1) meconic acid is not volatile; (2) the red\r\nfrom acetic and formic acids is at once removed by a slight excess of\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, sulphocyanide is not; (3) sulphocyanide-red\r\nis destroyed by solution of mercuric chloride, the others are not.\r\n\r\nThe above tests are sufficient, but the following additional ones have\r\nbeen at different times proposed.\r\n\r\nV. GUAIACUM TEST.—Paper dipped in fresh tincture of guaiacum,\r\ncontaining about 3 per cent. of the resin, then dried, then moistened\r\nwith dilute cupric sulphate solution (2 per cent.), becomes blue in HCN\r\nvapour. But the same effect is produced _without HCN_ by almost all\r\noxydants, such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, ferric chloride, nitric\r\nand nitrous acids, chromic acid, peroxide of hydrogen, ozone (Mohr’s\r\nToxicologie), also by ammonia, hypochlorous acid, soluble chromates,\r\n&c. (Blyth).\r\n\r\nVI. URANIUM TEST.—A grain or two of pure ferrous salt (ammonio-ferrous\r\nsulphate will do), and the same quantity of uranium nitrate, are\r\ndissolved in half an ounce of water. Two or three drops of this are\r\nplaced on a white plate, and a drop of the suspected liquid added.\r\nA purple precipitate, or a greyish purple colour in weak solutions,\r\nindicates HCN. Cobalt nitrate may be used instead of the uranium salt,\r\nand is nearly as delicate. (Carey Lea, American J. of Science [3] ix.,\r\n121.)\r\n\r\nVII. A hot solution of potassium cyanide mixed with _picric acid_ gives\r\na deep blood-red —“picrocyanic” acid). Free HCN does not give this\r\nreaction, and therefore must first be neutralized by an alkali. Said to\r\nbe more delicate than the iron tests. (C. D. Braun, Zeitschr. f. anal.\r\nCh. iii., 464.)\r\n\r\nVIII. Slightly alkalize the distillate with potash, add a few drops\r\nof _cupric sulphate_, and afterwards just enough hydrochloric acid\r\nto dissolve the excess of cupric hydrate: white cuprous cyanide will\r\nremain undissolved. “This test will detect 1/20000 of HCN in solution.”\r\n(Lassaigne, Ann. de Chimie, xxvii., 200.) But a similar effect is\r\nproduced by hydriodic acid, and potassium iodide might have been\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nIX. Mix the HCN with excess of alkali, add cobalt chloride and tartaric\r\nacid: on exposure to air a deep brown-red colour will be produced. (C.\r\nD. Braun, loc. cit.).\r\n\r\nX. If to a solution of HCN, potash be added in excess, and then a\r\nlittle very finely pulverised, or precipitated, mercuric oxide, the\r\nlatter will dissolve. Mercuric oxide is soluble in alkaline fluids only\r\nin presence of HCN. (Fresenius, Qual. Anal.).\r\n\r\nXI. “With peroxide of hydrogen, natural blood gives effervescence\r\nfrom escape of oxygen, but no discoloration. Blood containing HCN\r\ngives a brown colour, the spectroscopic bands disappearing, and no\r\neffervescence.” (Schönbein.) Hæmatocrystallin, the colouring matter\r\nof the blood corpuscles, combines, in fact, with HCN, giving a dark\r\ncoloured compound which appears to be crystallizable and definite in\r\ncomposition (Hoppe Seyler), does not act as a carrier of oxygen like\r\nthe natural hæmatocrystallin, and possesses a distinct spectrum (see\r\nThudichum, Chem. Physiology). The blue masses in the blood described by\r\nRalph (Journ. Microsc. Science, Oct. 24, 1866) have not been found by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nXII. Mercurous nitrate gives at once with HCN solutions, a black\r\ndeposit of metallic mercury, and a solution of mercuric cyanide. With\r\ncalomel, a similar reaction takes place according to Allen, but I have\r\nfound that the solution is not deodorized even by large excess of\r\ncalomel, the odour becoming stronger and more pungent than the original\r\nHCN. On evaporating, mercuric chloride is left. Probably some cyanogen\r\nchloride is formed. The odour is so much intensified that it might be\r\nof use as a test. In view of the possible administration of calomel,\r\nthe reaction is interesting.\r\n\r\nOf course it will not be necessary to employ all these methods. The\r\nodour, and the silver, Prussian blue, and “sulphur” tests will be\r\nsufficient. I would suggest a form of apparatus by which all the latter\r\ncould be obtained from the original substance without distillation in a\r\nretort.\r\n\r\nA shallow beaker or glass jar is closed by an india-rubber stopper,\r\nthrough two holes in which are passed glass rods ending in glass spoon\r\nbowls bent at right angles, so as to be horizontal when mounted. The\r\nbowls should be one inch in diameter, and will have to be specially\r\nmade. In the first bowl a few drops of silver nitrate are placed, in\r\nthe second a little potash. The apparatus is put in a warm place\r\nfor six or eight hours, then the two rods are removed, a third rod\r\nsubstituted, its bowl containing a drop or two of yellow ammonium\r\nsulphide, the other hole plugged, and the apparatus put back in the\r\nwarm place for two or three hours more. The first bowl will have the\r\nsilver cyanide, the second should be treated with ferric and ferrous\r\nsalt and hydrochloric acid for Prussian blue (_vide_), the third\r\nevaporated and ferric chloride added for the sulphocyanide test. This\r\narrangement prevents loss of HCN by volatilization, and also, with a\r\nlittle care, avoids any danger of the reagent dropping back into the\r\nsolution. The three rods cannot safely be placed in together, as the\r\nsulphide vapour would blacken the silver.\r\n\r\nFor the modifications in testing necessitated by the presence of\r\nmercury, &c., see under the different _Salts_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTS.\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid combines with bases to form the _cyanides_, which may\r\nbe thus grouped:—\r\n\r\nA. CYANIDES OF THE ALKALIES (potassium, sodium, ammonium), and of the\r\nALKALINE EARTHS (barium, strontium, calcium, magnesium). These are all\r\nsoluble in water, are alkaline to test paper, and are decomposed by\r\nall acids, even carbonic, hence they _exhale an odour of HCN_, and are\r\nnearly as poisonous as prussic acid itself. If they are present, the\r\nstomach contents must be alkaline. The only member of this group likely\r\nto be met with is\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM CYANIDE, KCN. Broken opaque white lumps, or small crystals,\r\ndeliquescent, smelling strongly of HCN, soapy to the feel, often\r\ncontaining much carbonate, and therefore effervescing with acids,\r\neasily fused by heat to a clear liquid, very soluble in water, less\r\nin alcohol. Used for removing silver stains in the form of “cyanogen\r\nsoap,” but very dangerous, as a cut or scratch may cause absorption,\r\nand even the unbroken skin, according to Allen, may absorb enough\r\nto cause symptoms. Its aqueous solution decomposes spontaneously\r\ninto formiate of potassium, ammonia, and a brown substance. Its taste\r\nis bitter and acrid, causing constriction and a burning heat in the\r\nthroat. It is very strongly alkaline. Distilled with dilute acids it\r\ngives off all its HCN. It easily responds to the other tests. In a\r\ncase of poisoning investigated by Dr. Bernays, a piece of potassium\r\ncyanide was found in the deceased’s mouth, which was much inflamed by\r\nits acridity. The alkali being strong, and the acid weak, cyanide of\r\npotassium has most of the effects of an alkaline irritant.\r\n\r\nThe _potassium_ may be found by incinerating a portion of the substance\r\nand testing for it in the ash. Taylor (Med. Jurisprudence) improperly\r\nsays that the _salt itself_ (cyanide of potassium) may be recovered\r\nfrom the organs by incinerating them in close vessels and treating the\r\nash with water. I have already mentioned that cyanide would be formed\r\nin this way from the organic matters themselves, even if not originally\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nB. MERCURIC CYANIDE, Hg(CN)_{2}. Of all metals mercury has most\r\naffinity for HCN, mercuric oxide decomposing other cyanides, even\r\nPrussian blue, and dissolving readily, as we have seen, in free HCN,\r\nor in alkaline cyanides. Hence if a compound of mercury have been\r\ngiven medicinally, the prussic acid will be found in the stomach\r\nas mercuric cyanide, which is easily soluble in water, neutral to\r\ntest paper, _quite inodorous_, and extremely poisonous. It is not\r\nofficially recognised in any Pharmacopœia, except the French; has\r\nbeen occasionally used in medicine instead of mercuric chloride,\r\nwhich it resembles in action, but has the advantage of not being\r\nincompatible with alkalies and organic matters (Royle’s Mat. Med.,\r\n6th ed.). It crystallizes in anhydrous four-sided obliquely-truncated\r\nwhite opaque prisms, with a disagreeable metallic taste, is permanent\r\nin the air, easily soluble in water, less in alcohol. It fails to\r\nrespond to the silver nitrate (partially) or Prussian blue tests,\r\nand gives the sulphur test with difficulty. It is decomposed by\r\ndistillation with hydrochloric acid, but only ⅔rds of the HCN pass over\r\ninto the distillate, unless ammonium chloride be added (Roscoe and\r\nSchorlemmer’s Chemistry). Whenever HCN is looked for, it is safer to\r\nexamine also for mercury, and, if found, to add a little hydrochloric\r\nacid and sulphuretted hydrogen to the original liquid, thereby\r\nprecipitating mercuric sulphide (black) and liberating the HCN, which\r\nmay be distilled off. If, however, excess of sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nhas been inadvertently added, it would blacken silver nitrate, and\r\nhence the silver test would not be available, unless the solution was\r\npreviously shaken with lead carbonate to remove the sulphide. But it\r\nwould not affect the Prussian blue or sulphur tests, as sulphide of\r\niron is soluble in hydrochloric acid. Mercuric cyanide also gives off\r\nall its HCN when distilled with iron filings or zinc dust, sulphuric\r\nacid, and water. This seems a better method.\r\n\r\nMercuric cyanide is said to be an irritant poison, and to be similar\r\nin its action to corrosive sublimate. Combination with mercury seems\r\nto mask the physiological action of HCN, just as it does its chemical\r\naction. The medicinal dose is 1/16th grain gradually increased to ½\r\ngrain, in pills or solution (Royle). 10 grains have proved fatal. By\r\nheat, when dry, it is broken up like silver cyanide into mercury and\r\ncyanogen.\r\n\r\nC. CYANIDES OF THE HEAVY METALS, as zinc, lead, copper, &c. _Silver\r\ncyanide_ has already been described. These are insoluble in water,\r\ninodorous, and probably, while intact, not poisonous. But they are\r\ndecomposed by mineral acids, and, as the gastric juice is acid, they\r\nwould more or less readily yield free HCN, with its usual odour and\r\neffects. The influence of the metal has also to be considered.\r\n\r\nD. DOUBLE CYANIDES, derived from iron, cobalt, manganese, chromium,\r\nplatinum, &c., are inodorous. Those of the alkalies and alkaline earths\r\nare alone soluble. The only common ones are ferro-and ferricyanide of\r\npotassium, the so-called yellow and red prussiates of potash. They are\r\nsaid to be merely purgative, not poisonous, but, from the comparative\r\nfacility with which they yield HCN by acids, they cannot be considered\r\nsafe. Soluble ferrocyanides give, with pure ferrous sulphate, a white\r\nprecipitate turning blue in air; with ferric chloride a precipitate of\r\nPrussian blue; with cupric sulphate a maroon precipitate. Ferricyanide\r\nsolutions give with ferrous salts a deep blue precipitate; with ferric\r\nsalts a dark-brown coloration. These reactions would be applied to a\r\nfiltered portion of the stomach contents. _Prussian blue_ is ferric\r\nferrocyanide mainly, but varies in composition: it is supposed to be\r\ninert.\r\n\r\nAlmen states (Chem. Centr. 1872, 439) that potassium ferrocyanide in\r\nsolution decomposes at ordinary temperatures, especially if a little\r\nfree acid be present, HCN being formed. Prussian blue only decomposes\r\nwhen warmed to 40° or 50° C. (therefore not in the body, C. G. S.),\r\n“hence the presence of HCN, if accompanied by ferrocyanide, is not a\r\nproof of poisoning.” But ferrocyanide is not in any Pharmacopœia, and\r\nis not administered medicinally. Yet, to answer a possible question, a\r\nknown fraction of the original substance might be extracted with water,\r\nand tested as above. The same observations apply to ferricyanide.\r\n\r\nWhen ferro-or ferricyanides are distilled with moderately strong\r\nsulphuric acid, a _portion_ of the contained HCN passes over; in\r\nfact, this is the common process for preparing prussic acid. The iron\r\nremains behind in the retort, in combination with potassium and the\r\nrest of the cyanogen. If ferric hydrate —“ferri peroxidum humidum”),\r\nor ferrous sulphate and potash, have been administered as antidotes to\r\nHCN, Prussian blue might be formed in the stomach. It would then show\r\na blue colour, either by itself or on addition of an acid, and blue\r\nparticles under the microscope, if in sufficient quantity. In this case\r\nthe HCN left in the stomach would have been rendered innocuous, and the\r\nprussic acid which had actually caused the death would be found free in\r\nthe blood, &c. The stomach contents might then show no HCN, either by\r\nodour or distillation, as Prussian blue is inodorous, and not easily\r\ndecomposed by dilute acids. With alkalies it turns brown, giving ferric\r\nhydrate and an alkaline ferrocyanide.\r\n\r\nLudwig and Maushner (Chem. Centr. 1881, 43), in a case of poisoning,\r\ndiscovered a quantity of potassium ferrocyanide in the body. This was\r\nremoved by slightly acidulating and carefully precipitating by ferric\r\nchloride. The filtrate, distilled with tartaric acid, yielded much HCN.\r\nThe sample of cyanide of potassium, which had probably caused death,\r\nwas afterwards found to contain a large proportion of ferrocyanide.\r\n\r\nE. SULPHONCYANIDES (Thiocyanates). Those of the alkalies and alkaline\r\nearths are soluble and colourless; ferric sulphocyanide is soluble,\r\nand intense blood-red (sulphur test); other sulphocyanides are mostly\r\ninsoluble. They are all inodorous, poisonous in moderate quantities,\r\nand are not officinal in any Pharmacopœia. Distilled with acids they\r\nbreak up, HCN being found in the distillate. It has been mentioned\r\nalready that ammonium sulphide, produced by putrefaction, may combine\r\nwith any HCN present to form ammonium sulphocyanide; therefore, if the\r\nmatters to be examined are alkaline, and putrefaction has commenced,\r\nAllen (Commerc. Org. Anal., 1879, art. HCN) recommends us to digest\r\nwith alcohol, filter, evaporate to dryness on a water bath, redissolve\r\nin a little water, filter again, and test the filtrate with ferric\r\nchloride after just acidulating with hydrochloric acid: the well-known\r\nblood-red colour will result (_see_ “Sulphur Test”). But the ordinary\r\ndistillation with tartaric or sulphuric acid would in this case also\r\ndetect the HCN, though the _whole_ might not pass into the distillate.\r\n\r\n_Sulphocyanide of mercury_ is the toy called “Pharaoh’s Serpent.” A\r\ncase of poisoning by it is recorded.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that traces of sulphocyanide are naturally\r\npresent in the saliva. If this salt be found, the question will occur,\r\nhow much could be accounted for by the saliva? Carpenter (Princ.\r\nof Human Physiol.) quotes Harley to the effect that the average\r\ndaily secretion from the salivary glands is 1 or 2 pounds: other\r\nobservers have stated that it varies greatly. The secretion itself\r\nis said to contain, in 1000 parts, one part (Frehrichs), or 0·6 part\r\n(Jacubowitsch), or even 0·3 part (Oehl), of potassium sulphocyanide;\r\nthat is, 4·2 to 7 grains per pound, equivalent to from 1 to 2 grains\r\nof HCN, or 2 to 4 grains if 2 pounds of saliva were secreted.\r\nThis would be a serious matter but for the fact that, whether from\r\ndecomposition by the gastric juice or otherwise, or from its passing\r\nout of the stomach as it passes in, it is certain that no such quantity\r\nis ever found naturally in the stomach, not more than a minute trace\r\nbeing ever given by the processes, unless hydrocyanic acid, in one of\r\nits forms, has actually been administered.\r\n\r\n_Cyanide of cadmium_, and some of its double salts, are sparingly\r\nsoluble. _Double cyanide of silver and potassium_ is soluble and\r\ncrystallizable. It is the salt used in electro-plating, and,\r\nas commonly met with, smells strongly of potassium cyanide.\r\n_Zinc-potassium cyanide_ has been used medicinally: it occurs in\r\nbeautiful crystals, inodorous when dry, but having a faint odour of HCN\r\nin solution.\r\n\r\nThe other cyanides are rare, and their physiological action is\r\nunrecorded. _Cyanic acid_ and cyanates are said not to be poisonous.\r\n\r\n_Oil of Bitter Almonds._—The crude oil contains, as we have seen, 8 to\r\n15 per cent, of HCN. Dissolved in spirit it forms “essence of almonds,”\r\nand is exceedingly poisonous, having caused thirty-one deaths in four\r\nyears (Taylor). Two drachms of the oil has killed a man in seventeen\r\nminutes (_Lancet_, 1868, p. 447), two ounces caused death immediately.\r\nThe odour of almonds is always distinct in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe oil can be freed from HCN, but then does not keep so well, and is\r\nmuch more costly. Its sp. gr. is 1·049; it boils at 356° F. The crude\r\noil is yellow: with concentrated sulphuric acid it gives a crimson-red\r\ncolour, and on diluting a yellow emulsion. We may estimate the amount\r\nof HCN in it by shaking with water, separating, adding dilute potash\r\nto the aqueous liquid, and testing it with standard silver solution\r\nas described under “Silver Test.” The other tests may also be used\r\nto prove the _presence_ of HCN; the guaiacum and copper paper being\r\nspecially convenient.\r\n\r\nA case of poisoning by bitter almonds is reported in the “South\r\nAustralian Register” for August 6th, 1879. A female child (whose\r\nage is not stated) ate a dozen of them, freshly taken from the tree,\r\nand died in three hours. The symptoms described are pain, coma, and\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n_Antidotes_ to HCN are generally useless since the death is so\r\nsudden. A moderately dilute solution of an alkali, such as potash,\r\nlime or washing soda, along with a little ferrous sulphate, would\r\nrender harmless so much of the poison as was still in the stomach\r\nunabsorbed. As already mentioned, this would cause a little difficulty\r\nin the chemical analysis. _Ammonia_ acts as an antidote by opposing\r\nthe _depressant_ action of HCN. _Chlorine water_ has been used: this\r\nconverts the HCN into ammonium chloride, carbon monoxide and dioxide,\r\nand a little cyanogen chloride.\r\n\r\n_Medicinal uses._—Its primary action is on the cerebrospinal nerves.\r\nIt is employed externally, largely diluted, to allay neuralgia and\r\nitching of the skin, and to relieve earache (not more than two drops of\r\nB. P. acid at a time)[24]: it must not come in contact with abrasions,\r\nor it might be absorbed and produce poisoning symptoms. Internally, it\r\nallays dyspepsia and the irritant effects of capsicum, &c. (Royle).\r\nSafe dose internally two to six minims of the B. P. 2 per cent. acid,\r\nsuspended if there is any constriction of the throat (Farquharson’s\r\nTherapeutics).\r\n\r\n_Fatal dose._—Smallest recorded (Med. Gaz. 35, p. 896); twenty grains\r\nof Scheele’s acid, fatal in twenty minutes, equal to fifty grains of\r\nB. P. 2 per cent. acid, equal to one grain of anhydrous prussic acid.\r\nLargest dose with recovery (_Lancet_, 1854, January 14), _one drachm_\r\n(sixty grains) of Scheele’s acid, but in this case energetic remedies\r\nwere at once applied. Average fatal dose of 2 per cent. acid, thirty\r\nminims (Royle’s Mat. Med., Dr. Harley, 6th ed.).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—These vary with the dose, &c. A large quantity kills in\r\ntwo to five minutes, though insensibility may ensue in a few seconds.\r\nBut patients may survive for twenty minutes, or even for an hour; and\r\nmay continue in imminent danger for several hours, and yet recover\r\n(Guy and Ferrier, Forens. Med., 1881). Many cases have occurred of\r\nvoluntary acts, such as concealing or throwing away the bottle,\r\nhaving been performed after fatal doses had been swallowed (_Ibid_,\r\np. 600). In animals, according to Mr. Nunneley, there is usually a\r\npeculiar plaintive cry, but not in man, though there may be a call for\r\nassistance. Convulsions, and involuntary evacuation of fæces or urine,\r\nmay or may not occur. Large doses kill by cardiac syncope; smaller ones\r\nby paralysis of the respiratory centre, or, if gradual, by impeded\r\noxidation of the blood (Farquharson’s Therapeutics). Other symptoms\r\nare, dilatation of pupils, muscular prostration, deep convulsive\r\nbreathing at long intervals, quick feeble irregular pulse, spasmodic\r\nclosure of the jaws and clenching of the hands (Taylor). Breathing\r\nsometimes stertorous (Christison, Ed. Month. Journal, February, 1850,\r\np. 97. Reg. _v._ Burroughs, Cent. Crim. Court, February, 1857).\r\nVomiting occasional, or foaming at the mouth.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem appearances._—Not characteristic (Farquharson; Guy and\r\nFerrier). Putrefaction not accelerated (Taylor). The veins contain dark\r\nfluid blood: the right side of the heart is gorged (Harley). There may\r\nor may not be congestion and reddening of stomach and intestines, or of\r\nthe brain. On the whole, the appearances are those of asphyxia.[25] The\r\nodour should be sought for in all parts, and _as soon as possible_ the\r\norgans should be shut up in stoppered jars, or well-corked and sealed\r\nbottles, and sent at once for analysis.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and post-mortem appearances of poisoning by _Cyanide of\r\nPotassium_ are the same as those of prussic acid, except that:—\r\n\r\n1. Convulsions are more common.\r\n\r\n2. Owing to the irritant action of the alkali, the stomach is reddened.\r\n\r\n3. The contents are alkaline.\r\n\r\nThe fatal dose is less than five grains, but Taylor mentions a case of\r\nrecovery after nearly one ounce of the commercial cyanide, which may,\r\nhowever, have contained much carbonate.\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid is not, in the strict sense, a _cumulative_ poison;\r\n“but doses that exceed the proper medicinal limit may happen to prove\r\nfatal though similar previous ones have appeared to be harmless,\r\nin consequence of a change in the body itself.” (Guy and Ferrier’s\r\nForensic Medicine, 1881, p. 606.)\r\n\r\nIn the trial of George Ball for poisoning his mother with prussic\r\nacid, at Lewes, July, 1860 (previously reported), the question arose\r\nas to the difference between _minims_ and _drops_. A minim of water\r\nis supposed to weigh a grain: if the fluid is heavier than water, it\r\nweighs more than a grain; if lighter, it weighs less. But a _drop_ is\r\nquite an indefinite quantity: it is affected, not only by the specific\r\ngravity, but by the cohesion of the fluid, by the shape and size of the\r\nvessel, the manner of pouring, and the temperature. I have made some\r\nexperiments which show the irregularity. (See also Woodman and Tidy’s\r\nForensic Medicine, p. 456.)\r\n\r\n  ┌────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬────────┬────────┐\r\n  │                                    │           │        │Measured│\r\n  │                                    │           │ No. of │  in    │\r\n  │         Capacity of Bottle.        │  Liquid.  │ Drops. │Minims. │\r\n  ├────────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼────────┼────────┤\r\n  │(Stoppered) 6 fluid oz.             │   Water   │  117   │  180   │\r\n  │              Do.

Org. Anal.) asserts that its detection is rarely possible after\r\nmore than twenty-four hours. This is astonishing, as Casper separated\r\nmore than 18 milligrammes from a body eight days after death; Sokoloff\r\ndetected it in hounds sixty days after; Dragendorff after four weeks in\r\na dog, after eight or ten days in man. Reichardt (Arch. Pharm. 3, 19,\r\n204) found it in a body two months after death—in the organs, but not\r\nin the urine. In the Tawell trial, also, the interval was considerable.\r\n\r\nCasper states in his Handbook (vol. iii., illustrative cases of HCN)\r\nthat Schauenstein (one of the Prussian official chemists), twenty-six\r\nhours after death, found no HCN in the stomach, but a considerable\r\namount of _formic acid_, the result of its metamorphosis. We know that\r\nstrong HCN, exposed to light, decomposes into formate of ammonium,\r\nwhich, by distillation with a dilute acid, would give formic acid in\r\nthe distillate. That such a change should occur so rapidly in a dilute\r\nsolution, and in the darkness of the body, is improbable. It would be\r\nwell, however, that formic acid should be looked for in the distillate\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\nCarefully neutralize a _measured portion_ with pure soda or potash;\r\nevaporate on the water-bath to dryness. The alkaline formate will be\r\nleft in white crystals if present, together with the cyanide, which\r\nwill not crystallize, but remain as a deliquescent mass. Dissolve in a\r\nlittle water, and divide into three equal portions.\r\n\r\n(1.) To the first add silver nitrate in slight excess. Cyanide of\r\nsilver will precipitate, formate will remain in solution, if not too\r\nconcentrated. Filter, if possible. On boiling, if any blackening\r\nhappens from reduction of the silver, formic acid is _probably_\r\npresent. _Acetic_ acid does not reduce silver nitrate.\r\n\r\n(2.) To the second add dilute _neutral_ ferric chloride (a solution of\r\niron-alum answers admirably). A red-brown colour, removed by a drop of\r\nhydrochloric acid, indicates either acetic or formic acid.\r\n\r\n(3.) Evaporate the third portion to dryness, and ignite gently in a\r\nclosed crucible. Formate and acetate will be turned into carbonate,\r\nwhile cyanide will remain unchanged if air be excluded. If then\r\neffervescence take place on treating the residue with a little\r\nhydrochloric acid, it is a confirmation of the presence of formic or\r\nacetic acid. The first test will have revealed which it is.\r\n\r\nMany animal substances, when distilled with strong acids, _do_ give\r\nacetic and formic acids, but they do not act thus with _dilute_ acids.\r\nYet a stomach will usually yield a little acetic acid from the food\r\nhaving turned sour.\r\n\r\nIf formic acid be present, it will probably have proceeded from the\r\ndecomposition of HCN. Then the reduced silver obtained in the first\r\ntest should be weighed, and calculated into formic acid, and also into\r\nhydrocyanic acid (108 parts of silver = 46 parts formic acid, or 27\r\nparts HCN). The result may be stated thus:—\r\n\r\n“Hydrocyanic acid actually found,—-- grains. Formic acid found,—--\r\ngrains. If this had proceeded from the decomposition of hydrocyanic\r\nacid, it would correspond to an additional amount of—-- grains of\r\nhydrocyanic acid.”\r\n\r\nIt is needless to observe that the mere finding of formic acid would\r\nbe no proof of the administration of HCN, unless strong corroborative\r\nevidence were at hand.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we must always try, and we may often hope, to find HCN if\r\ngiven, either free, as cyanide, or as sulphocyanide, even after months\r\nhave elapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTRIALS FOR POISONING BY STRYCHNIA. PALMER, DOVE, AND BARLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE cases are reported in this chapter. (1) That of William Palmer,\r\nfor the poisoning of John Parsons Cook, at Rugeley, in Staffordshire,\r\nwhich, in consequence of the prejudice existing against him in that\r\ncounty, was transferred by Act of Parliament to the Central Criminal\r\nCourt in the City of London,[26] and taken before Lord Chief Justice\r\nCampbell, on the 14th, and eleven following days, of May, 1856. (2)\r\nThat of William Dove, for the murder of his wife, Harriet, at Leeds,\r\ntried at York, July 16th, 1856, before Baron Bramwell. (3) That of\r\nSilas Barlow, for the murder of his mistress, Eliza Soper, at Vauxhall,\r\ntried at the Central Criminal Court, November, 1876, before Mr. Justice\r\nDenman.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ of these trials is remarkable for the conflict of the\r\nmedico-scientific evidence, the most eminent men among our physicians\r\nand analysts being called on either side, and the most contradictory\r\ntestimony as to the possibility of detecting strychnia being given by\r\nthem. The _second_ trial shows the dangerous effect of hasty newspaper\r\nreports in such cases—the murder of his wife by Dove having been\r\nclearly suggested by the popular report to which some of the journals\r\nof the day gave circulation, that Dr. Taylor, the eminent analyst, had\r\nstated, in connection with Palmer’s case, that strychnia could not be\r\ndetected by analysis. This case is also interesting from the nature\r\nof the insanity which was set up by the defence. The _last_ trial,\r\nthat of Silas Barlow, exposes the danger of the sale of the “Vermin\r\nKillers,” so popular with all householders, most, if not all, of which\r\ncontain a large proportion of strychnia, and thus offer a ready means\r\nfor murder or suicide, especially as the purchase of them would not be\r\nattributed to an evil intention. It is but a poor consolation to know\r\nthat, when the mischief has been done, the punishment of the actor can\r\nbe secured by the skill of the analyst.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUGELEY POISONINGS.\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF WILLIAM PALMER, _May 14, and following days_, 1856.[27]\r\n\r\n _Before_ LORD CHIEF JUSTICE CAMPBELL, BARON ALDERSON, _and_ MR.\r\n JUSTICE CRESSWELL, _at the_ CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT.\r\n\r\n _For the Prosecution_: The Attorney-General (Sir A. Cockburn), Mr.\r\n Edwin James, Q.C., Mr. Bodkin, Mr. Welsby, and Mr. Huddlestone.\r\n\r\n _For the Defence_: Mr. Serjeant Shee, Mr. Grove, Q.C., Mr. Gray, and\r\n Mr. Kenealy.\r\n\r\n_William Palmer_, surgeon, of Rugeley, Staffordshire, aged 31, was\r\nindicted for the wilful murder of John Parsons Cook.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\n_Connection between Cook and Palmer._\r\n\r\n_Mr. Cook_, having been originally brought up as a solicitor, on coming\r\ninto a fortune of from £12,000 to £13,000, abandoned his profession,\r\nand took to the turf, where he became acquainted with the prisoner,\r\nwho had for some years kept racehorses. Originally in good local\r\npractice, Palmer had of late transferred the majority of his patients\r\nto a Mr. Thirlby, who had previously been his assistant, retaining only\r\ntwo or three more immediately connected with him or his family. His\r\nfather, originally a working sawyer, had, by his industry, gradually\r\nrisen to be a timber merchant in a large way of business, and, on his\r\nsudden death in 1837, left a fortune of £70,000. As he died intestate,\r\nthe eldest son executed a deed by which each of the children took\r\n£7,000, and the remainder was left to the widow. Of these children,\r\nseven in number, the prisoner was the fourth. As a child he was known\r\nfor his amiability and kindness, but also for his shy and underhand\r\nmanner, and his partiality for trying experiments of a cruel nature on\r\nanimals. “He was just and generous,” said one of his early friends,\r\n“when he grew up, and he never forgot an old face.”[28] Originally\r\napprenticed to a firm of druggists in Liverpool, he had to leave\r\nthem in consequence of a scandal in money matters; was then put with\r\nMr. Tylecote, a surgeon, near Rugeley; walked the London hospitals,\r\nliving the gay life of so many of that class of students; passed his\r\nexaminations; married the illegitimate daughter of an Indian officer,\r\nwho left her a small property; and set up in Rugeley as a surgeon.\r\nOf his five children only the first, a son, was living at the time of\r\nhis trial, the others all dying suddenly of convulsions within a few\r\nweeks after their birth. He was an indulgent husband, a kind father, a\r\nregular attendant at church, and apparently a religious man.\r\n\r\nOn his marriage, Palmer commenced to live in a handsome style, keeping\r\nhis carriage, and soon after began training and breeding racehorses,\r\nand occupying himself on the turf. As his wife’s fortune was only for\r\nher life, in 1854 he insured her life for £13,000, the premiums on\r\nwhich exceeded the income he derived from her, further insurances of\r\na greater amount being declined by other offices. Within nine months\r\nafter this, his wife was dead, and the insurance money received,\r\nrelieving Palmer from difficulties that were already pressing on\r\nhim. Again, within three months after his wife’s death, Palmer was\r\nendeavouring to effect insurances on the life of his brother Walter,\r\na confirmed drunkard, to the enormous extent of £80,000. Only one of\r\nthese policies, that in the Prince of Wales’ office, was accepted, the\r\nother offices being put on their guard by the hint that “his wife had\r\ndied after the first payment of the premium had been made.” Pressed\r\nby his pecuniary difficulties, he then tried to effect an insurance\r\nfor £10,000 on the life of one George Bate, a decayed farmer, whom he\r\nemployed as a kind of farm bailiff, and represented as a gentleman and\r\nan esquire, with a famous cellar of wine, but the insurance offices\r\nwere now thoroughly awake; a detective was sent to interview the\r\nesquire, whom he found hoeing turnips, and the scheme fell through.[29]\r\n\r\nSince 1854, Palmer had been in the hands of the bill discounters,\r\nand especially of a money-lending attorney in Mayfair of the name of\r\nPratt, with whom he from time to time discounted what purported to be\r\nthe acceptances of his mother, some of which were renewed on partial\r\npayment, others cleared off by the money received from the insurance of\r\nhis wife’s life.\r\n\r\n “This,” said the Attorney-General, “brings us to the close of 1854.\r\n In the course of that year he effected another insurance in his\r\n brother’s name, but Palmer was the real party, and corresponded with\r\n Mr. Pratt on the subject of effecting it, and the policy for £13,000\r\n was assigned to Palmer. On the strength of that policy, which remained\r\n in the hands of Pratt, who paid the first premium out of a bill he\r\n discounted for Palmer at 60 per cent., they proceeded to discount\r\n further bills, this policy being kept as a collateral security. The\r\n bills, in the whole, discounted in the course of that year, amounted\r\n to £12,500—two in June, which were held over from month to month to\r\n keep them alive—two of £2000 each in March, 1855, with the proceeds\r\n of which Palmer bought two racehorses, Nettle and Chicken. These bills\r\n were renewed from time to time, and eventually came due in January,\r\n 1856. Another bill for £2000 was discounted in April, 1855, renewed\r\n like the others, and became due on the 25th of October. On the 9th of\r\n July another bill for £2000 was discounted, renewed, and became due on\r\n the 12th of January. On the 27th of September another bill for £1000\r\n was discounted to pay for the renewal of the bills due and then coming\r\n due. So that when the Shrewsbury races took place in November, 1855,\r\n bills were due or rapidly maturing to the extent of £11,500, every\r\n one of which bore the forged acceptance of the prisoner’s mother. You\r\n will therefore understand the pressure which naturally and necessarily\r\n arose upon him; the pressure of the liabilities for £11,500 which\r\n he had not a shilling in the world to meet, and the still greater\r\n pressure which arose from the consciousness that the moment he could\r\n go on no longer, his mother would be resorted to for payment. The fact\r\n of his having committed these forgeries would be known, and would\r\n bring on him the penalty of the law for that crime so committed. The\r\n insurance company having refused to pay the policy effected on his\r\n brother’s life, no assistance could be derived from that source.”\r\n\r\nAlready, in May, 1855, Cook, with whom he had become intimately\r\nacquainted in racing transactions, had lent him his acceptance for\r\n£200 to meet a small claim, and had had to pay it on Palmer’s default.\r\nIn August of that year, Palmer again asked the money-lending attorney\r\nof Mayfair to discount a bill of Cook’s for £500, representing that\r\nCook required the money. It was, however, declined without further\r\nsecurity, and then Cook assigned two of his racehorses—Polestar, the\r\nsubsequent winner at Shrewsbury, and Sirius—as a collateral security,\r\nand obtained only £375 in money, and a wine warrant for £65, the rest\r\nbeing swallowed up in discount and expenses. This money and warrant\r\nCook never got, Palmer asking Pratt to send it to the post-office at\r\nDoncaster, whence he obtained it; and as it was made “to order,” and\r\nbore a receipt stamp, Palmer, it was alleged, forged the name “John\r\nParsons Cook,” and took the cheque and the warrant, and appropriated\r\nthe proceeds. That bill would be due on the day of Cook’s death. In the\r\nsame month it was that he attempted to effect the insurance on Bate’s\r\nlife and failed; and though Cook had, at Palmer’s request, attested\r\nthis proposal, which referred to Palmer as the usual medical attendant,\r\nbeyond that he had nothing to do with this attempt.\r\n\r\nSuch was the desperate position of the prisoner at this time. It,\r\nhowever, rapidly grew worse. On the 6th of November a writ for £2000\r\nagainst Palmer, and another for the same sum against his mother, were\r\nissued, but held over by Pratt in order that Palmer might make some\r\narrangement. This he did to the amount of £800, and in consequence,\r\nafter allowing for an exorbitant discount, £600 was taken off the bill,\r\nleaving £1400 to be met. The Prince of Wales office had refused to pay\r\non Walter Palmer’s life, and Mr. Pratt would not wait any longer. On\r\nthe 13th of November, Pratt wrote him that all the bills, £11,500 in\r\namount, must be met—a letter which Palmer must have received the next\r\nday—the day after that on which Cook’s horse, Polestar, won at the\r\nShrewsbury races. After the race, Cook had between £700 and £800 in\r\nhis pocket from bets paid on the course, and from the stakes and his\r\nother bets would be entitled on the week after to receive more than\r\na thousand pounds at Tattersal’s. Before that day Cook was dead, his\r\npocket-book empty, and his betting-book not to be found.\r\n\r\nCook, though slightly disposed to pulmonary complaints, was a hale\r\nand hearty young man, at the time of his fatal illness suffering only\r\nfrom debility.[30] It was only natural that his victory should excite\r\nhim, and that with some friends he should celebrate it with two or\r\nthree bottles of champagne at the “Raven Hotel” on his return from the\r\ncourse. He was, however, generally abstemious. He went to bed with\r\nnothing the matter with him, got up the next day and went on the course\r\nas usual. That night his illness began.\r\n\r\nLate on the evening of the 14th of November, a betting agent of Cook’s,\r\nof the name of _Fisher_, who was staying at the “Raven,” was invited by\r\nCook to come into the room where he, Palmer, and one Myatt were, and\r\ntake some brandy and water.\r\n\r\n “They were drinking grog,” says _Fisher_; “the deceased had some\r\n brandy and water before him. He asked me to sit down, and I did so.\r\n Cook asked the prisoner to have some more brandy and water, and he\r\n said he would not until Cook had drunk his. Cook then took up his\r\n glass, and drank almost all the liquor that was in it, and, within a\r\n minute, he exclaimed, ‘There is something in it; it burns my throat\r\n dreadfully.’ Upon his saying this, Palmer took up the glass, and\r\n sipped what remained in it, and said, ‘There is nothing in it.’ There\r\n was a very small quantity in the glass when the prisoner took it up.\r\n At this time a person of the name of _Reid_ came in, and the prisoner\r\n handed the glass to him, and asked if he thought there was anything in\r\n it, and handed it to me also, and we said there was nothing we could\r\n recognize, as the glass was empty. I said, however, that there was a\r\n strong scent upon it, but I could not detect anything but brandy. Cook\r\n went out of the room, and when he returned he called me out. I went\r\n with him into my sitting-room. He appeared very ill, and he told me he\r\n had been very sick and asked me to take his money. He said he thought\r\n Palmer had been dosing him. He gave me £700. He did not say what I\r\n was to do with the money. He was very sick again after he had given\r\n me the money, and asked me to go into his bedroom with him. I did\r\n so. Another person named _Jones_ went with us; the deceased vomited\r\n violently in his bedroom in our presence. He was so ill I recommended\r\n him to send for Dr. Gibson, who attended and gave him some medicine.\r\n He was certainly not drunk; there was nothing about him approaching to\r\n drunkenness. He appeared very ill the next morning, but a good deal\r\n better than the previous night, and I returned him his money.”[31]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gibson_, who saw Cook during this attack, confirmed Fisher’s and\r\nReed’s account, stating that his tongue was perfectly clean, his pulse\r\ngood, but his stomach appeared distended, that he only administered\r\nsimple remedies. Cook told him he thought he had been poisoned. He\r\nseemed a little excited, but not drunk. A _Mrs. Brooks_, who also\r\nattends races, added the following evidence on this incident:—\r\n\r\n “I went to the ‘Raven’ to see Palmer about half-past ten at night\r\n on Wednesday the 15th. I went upstairs, and asked a servant to tell\r\n Palmer that I wished to speak to him. She said he was there. At the\r\n top of the stairs are two passages, one facing, the other to the left.\r\n I turned to the left. I saw Palmer standing by a small table in the\r\n passage. He had a tumbler-glass in his hand in which there appeared to\r\n be a small quantity of water. I did not see him put anything into it.\r\n There was a light between me and him, and he held it up to the light.\r\n He said to me, ‘I will be with you presently.’ He saw me the moment I\r\n got to the top of the stairs. He stood at the table a minute or two\r\n longer with the glass in his hand, holding it up to the light and\r\n shaking it. The door of a sitting-room was partially open, and he went\r\n into it, taking the glass with him. In two or three minutes he came\r\n out again with the glass. What was in it was still of the colour of\r\n water. He then went into his own sitting-room, and the door was shut.”\r\n\r\nSome brandy and water, which Palmer afterwards brought to Mrs. Brooks,\r\nproved harmless to her; but she admitted that on the previous day\r\na great number of the racing men at Shrewsbury were affected with\r\nsickness and purging, and that there was a talk in the town of the\r\nwater being poisoned.[32] With the return of Cook from Shrewsbury to\r\nRugeley with Palmer, on the day after this suspicious attack, the\r\nsummary of the case ends, it being necessary to detail the subsequent\r\nevents in the words of the leading witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the 15th of November, Cook returned from Shrewsbury\r\nwith Palmer to the “Talbot Arms,” at Rugeley, an inn situated\r\nimmediately opposite Palmer’s own house. He said he had been ill at\r\nShrewsbury, went to bed early, dined with Palmer the next day, and\r\nreturned to the inn at night, apparently none the worse, and quite\r\nsober.\r\n\r\n “On the following morning,” said _Mills_, the chambermaid, “Palmer\r\n came to see him, and asked me for a cup of coffee for him, which I\r\n procured, and I think I gave it to the deceased, and left the room.\r\n I did not see him drink the coffee; but when I went into the room\r\n shortly afterwards, I found it had been vomited in the utensil. I\r\n did not observe a jug of toast-and-water in the bedroom; but a jug\r\n that did not belong to the bedroom was sent down at night, for me to\r\n make some fresh toast-and-water in it. The prisoner was in deceased’s\r\n bedroom four or five times on this day, and I heard him tell Cook\r\n that he would send him over some soup. I afterwards saw some broth\r\n in the kitchen, which I knew had not been made in the Talbot Arms;\r\n and the waitress took this broth to the deceased’s bedroom. I saw the\r\n prisoner after this, and he asked me if Mr. Cook had had his broth;\r\n and the waitress said she had taken it to him, but he refused to take\r\n it, and said that it would not stay on his stomach. The prisoner then\r\n told me to fetch the broth, as Mr. Cook must have it, and I did so,\r\n and left it in deceased’s bedroom, and shortly afterwards I saw that\r\n it had been vomited. The same evening some barley water was made for\r\n the deceased, and also some arrowroot, but I cannot say whether they\r\n remained on his stomach or not. Mr. Bamford, the doctor, was called\r\n in after this. On the Sunday after the deceased came to the Talbot\r\n Arms, I saw him in his bedroom about eight o’clock in the morning,\r\n and he said he had slept well since twelve o’clock, and he felt\r\n pretty comfortable. A large breakfast cup of broth was brought from\r\n the prisoner’s house between twelve and one o’clock on the Sunday,\r\n and I took it up to the deceased’s bedroom. I tasted the broth, and\r\n very soon afterwards I was sick. I drunk about two tablespoonfuls. I\r\n vomited violently all the afternoon, and was obliged to go to bed. I\r\n was quite well up to the time of my drinking the broth. I saw the\r\n deceased on Sunday evening, and he seemed in good spirits, and not to\r\n be any worse. I saw the deceased on the Monday morning between seven\r\n and eight o’clock, when I took him a cup of coffee for his breakfast.\r\n He did not vomit the coffee. Palmer had seen him before this, but he\r\n did not come again until ten o’clock at night. The deceased got up\r\n about one o’clock, and he shaved and dressed himself, and appeared a\r\n great deal better, but said that he was exceedingly weak. Ashmall,\r\n the jockey, came to see him on the Monday, and also Mr. Saunders, the\r\n trainer. Soon after one o’clock, the deceased took some arrowroot, and\r\n it remained on his stomach. The deceased went to bed at four o’clock,\r\n and between nine and ten the prisoner went into his room, and I left\r\n him there. Some pills were sent by Dr. Bamford for the deceased, about\r\n eight o’clock, and I took them into his room, and placed them on the\r\n dressing-table, and they were there when the prisoner went into the\r\n room. I went to bed between ten and eleven, and I was called up about\r\n twelve. I then heard violent screams from the deceased’s bedroom, and\r\n upon entering it _I saw the deceased sitting up in bed, and he desired\r\n me to fetch the prisoner directly. I told him he had been sent for,\r\n and I then walked to the bedside and found one of the pillows was\r\n upon the floor. I picked it up and asked Mr. Cook if he would lay his\r\n head down. At this time he was beating the bedclothes apparently in\r\n great agony, and he told me he could not lie down, and he should be\r\n suffocated if he did; and he then, in a loud tone, asked me again to\r\n send for Mr. Palmer. There was a sort of jumping or jerking about his\r\n head and neck and body all this time, and his breathing was very much\r\n affected. He screamed three or four times while I was in the room, and\r\n twice he called out, ‘Murder.’ He asked me to rub one of his hands,\r\n and I found it quite stiff. It was the left hand. The fingers were\r\n all stretched out and there was no motion in them, and they twitched\r\n while I was rubbing the hand._ Palmer came into the room while this\r\n was going on, and the deceased recognized him, and said, ‘Oh, Palmer,’\r\n or ‘Oh, doctor, I shall die.’ The prisoner replied, ‘Oh, my lad,\r\n you won’t;’ and after remaining a minute or two in the room he told\r\n me to stay there, and went out. He returned in a very few minutes,\r\n and he then produced some pills, and he gave the deceased a draught\r\n in a wine-glass, after he had given him the pills. Cook said that\r\n the pills stuck in his throat, and the prisoner told me to give him\r\n some toast-and-water, and I did so in a teaspoon. _His head and body\r\n continued jerking, and he seized the spoon fast between his teeth and\r\n seemed to bite it very hard._ The deceased shortly after swallowed\r\n the toast-and-water and the pills, and the prisoner then handed him\r\n the draught. It had a thick heavy appearance. The deceased snapped\r\n at the glass in the same way he did at the spoon, and he appeared\r\n unable to control himself. _As soon as he had swallowed the draught,\r\n he vomited it immediately, and it appeared to me to smell like opium._\r\n The prisoner then made the remark that he hoped the pills had stayed,\r\n and he searched the utensil in which the deceased had vomited with a\r\n quill, and said that he could not find them; and he told me to take\r\n the utensil away and empty it carefully, and I did so, but could not\r\n see any trace of the pills. After this the deceased seemed a little\r\n more easy. _The attack lasted altogether about half an hour, and\r\n during the whole of the time he was quite conscious._ When he was\r\n composed he asked the prisoner to feel how his heart beat; and Palmer\r\n went to his bedside, and put his hand either to his heart, or the\r\n side of his face, and he said it was all right. I left the deceased\r\n about three o’clock in the morning, and at this time the prisoner\r\n was sitting in the easy chair, and I believe he was asleep. About\r\n six o’clock the same morning I saw the deceased again, and he told\r\n me that Mr. Palmer had left him about a quarter past five o’clock.\r\n _I asked him how he was, and he replied that he was no worse; and he\r\n then asked me if I had ever seen any one in such agony as he was the\r\n night before, and I told him I never had. He then said he was sure I\r\n should never like to see anyone in such agony again, and I inquired\r\n what he thought was the cause. He replied that it was through some\r\n pills that Palmer had given him about half-past ten. The deceased was\r\n quite composed and quiet at this time, and there was no jerking or\r\n convulsion about him, but his eyes looked very wild._ About twelve\r\n o’clock the deceased desired me to send the Boots over to Mr. Palmer\r\n to know whether he might have a cup of coffee. A message was brought\r\n back that he might, and Mr. Palmer would be over immediately. When I\r\n took up the coffee the prisoner was in the room, and I gave him the\r\n coffee, and he tasted it to see that it was not too strong. Mr. Jones\r\n came to the inn about three o’clock, and I saw him in the deceased’s\r\n room, and the prisoner after this told me that Cook had vomited the\r\n coffee. _I saw Cook several times after this, and he appeared in very\r\n good spirits, and talked about getting up the next morning, and wished\r\n the barber to be sent for to shave him._ I did not see the deceased\r\n later than half-past ten o’clock on the Tuesday night, and the\r\n prisoner was then in his bedroom, and I gave him some toast-and-water\r\n for the deceased, and the prisoner said he did not want anything more.\r\n I sat up in the kitchen on purpose to see how Mr. Cook went on, and I\r\n heard the bell of his room ring violently about ten minutes before\r\n twelve, and went up immediately. _I found the deceased sitting up, and\r\n Mr. Jones had his arm round his shoulders, apparently supporting him._\r\n The deceased when he saw me, told me to fetch Palmer directly. I went\r\n over to his house, and rang the surgery bell, and the prisoner came to\r\n the window almost in an instant, and opened a small casement, and I\r\n told him to come over to Mr. Cook, as he was in much the same state as\r\n he was the night before. He made some reply, and I returned at once to\r\n the ‘Talbot Arms,’ and in a minute or two the prisoner came into Mr.\r\n Cook’s room. The first thing he said was that he did not think he had\r\n ever dressed so quickly before in his life. At this time Mr. Jones was\r\n supporting the deceased. I went out into the landing about a minute\r\n or two, and the prisoner came out, and I observed to him that Mr.\r\n Cook appeared in the same state as the night before, and he replied,\r\n ‘Not so ill by a fiftieth part.’ He then went to his own house, and\r\n returned in a very short time to the deceased’s bedroom. _I then heard\r\n the deceased ask to be turned on his right side_, and I then shortly\r\n after heard that he was dead.”\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination of Elizabeth Mills_ was mainly directed to three\r\npoints—(1.) The fact of Mr. Cook complaining of sore throat, but not\r\nof difficulty in swallowing, in May, 1855, when the witness said all\r\nthat he did was to use a gargle sent by Dr. Bamford. (2.) Her omission\r\nto tell the coroner that the broth had made her sick; that Cook had\r\nsaid he became ill on taking the pills sent by Palmer; that he beat\r\nthe bedclothes, called “Murder!” and “twitched” when she rubbed his\r\nhands. These omissions the witness accounted for by the fact that the\r\ncoroner did not ask her to detail all the symptoms she saw, but merely\r\nrequired her to answer such questions as he put. On her depositions\r\nbeing read, the Attorney-General proposed to call evidence to prove the\r\nnegligence and misconduct of the coroner, but the court ruled that it\r\nwas inadmissible.[33] (3.) That the witness had had several interviews\r\nwith Cook’s stepfather, Stevens, his attorney, and the chief constable,\r\nbefore giving evidence—the defence imputing that they had instructed\r\nher in the symptoms. She denied, however, any such conduct on their\r\npart. She had heard of Dove’s case, but not read it, and Mr. Stevens\r\nhad never given her any money. An attempt to injure her moral character\r\nin reference to a man of the name of Dutton entirely failed, and her\r\nevidence remained substantially uncontradicted.\r\n\r\n_Lavinia Barnes_, the waitress at the “Talbot Arms,” remembered Cook\r\ncoming there on Monday, the 12th, on his way to the races, and not\r\ncomplaining of illness, and she saw him when he returned on Thursday,\r\nthe 15th, and after he came from dining at Palmer’s, on the Friday\r\nevening, when he spoke to her, and was sober.\r\n\r\n “On the Saturday,” continued this witness, “I saw him twice. Some\r\n broth was sent over and taken up to him by me. He could not take it;\r\n he was too sick. I carried it down, and put it in the kitchen. I\r\n afterwards saw Palmer, and told him Cook was too sick to take it; he\r\n said he must have it. Elizabeth Mills afterwards took it up again.\r\n Mills was taken ill with violent vomiting on the Sunday between twelve\r\n and one o’clock. She went to bed, and did not come downstairs till\r\n four or five o’clock. I saw some broth that day in the kitchen; it was\r\n in a sick cup, with two handles, not belonging to the house. I did\r\n not see it brought; it was taken back to Palmer’s. On Monday morning\r\n (19th) I saw Palmer, and he told Mills he was going to London. I saw\r\n Cook during that day. Saunders came to see him, and took him up some\r\n brandy-and-water. I slept that night in the next room to Cook’s.\r\n Palmer came between eight and nine in the evening, but I did not\r\n see if he went up to Cook’s room. (_According to Mills, Palmer had\r\n seen Cook in the morning, and saw him again at ten at night._) About\r\n twelve o’clock I was in the kitchen, when Cook’s bell rang violently.\r\n I went upstairs. Cook was very ill, and asked me to send for Palmer.\r\n _He screamed out ‘’Murder!’ He exclaimed that he was in violent\r\n pain—that he was suffocating. His eyes were wild-looking, standing\r\n a great way out of his head. He was beating his bed with his arms.\r\n He cried out, ‘Christ, have mercy on my soul!’ I never saw a person\r\n in such a state._ Having called up Mills, I left to send ‘Boots’ for\r\n Palmer, who came, and I again went into Cook’s room. _Cook was then\r\n more composed. He said, ‘Oh, doctor, I shall die!’ Palmer replied,\r\n ‘Don’t be alarmed, my lad._’ I saw Cook drink a dark mixture out of a\r\n glass, but do not know who gave it him. I both heard and saw him snap\r\n at the glass. He brought up the draught. I left him between twelve\r\n and one, when he was more composed. On Tuesday he seemed a little\r\n better. At night, a little before twelve, the bell rang again. I was\r\n in the kitchen. Mills went upstairs, and I followed her, and _heard\r\n Cook screaming_, but did not go into the room. I stood outside the\r\n door, and saw Palmer come. He had been fetched. I said, as he passed\r\n me, ‘Mr. Cook is ill again.’ He said, ‘Oh, is he?’ and went into the\r\n room. He was dressed in his usual manner, and wore a black coat and\r\n a cap.[34] She also heard him make the observation to Mills before\r\n reported. She went to the room, but came out before Cook died.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of his severe illness, the following deposition of _Dr.\r\nBamford_ (an aged local practitioner) before the coroner was read:—\r\n\r\n “I attended the late Mr. Cook, at the request of William Palmer, and\r\n first saw him about three o’clock on Saturday, the 17th of November,\r\n _when he was suffering from violent vomiting, the stomach being in\r\n that irritable state, that it would not contain a teaspoonful of milk.\r\n There was perfect moisture of the skin, and he was quite sensible._ I\r\n prescribed medicine for him; and Mr. Palmer went up to my house and\r\n waited until I had made it up, and then took it away. I prescribed a\r\n saline draught, to be taken in an effervescing state. Between seven\r\n and eight in the evening Mr. Palmer again requested me to visit Mr.\r\n Cook. _The sickness still continued, everything he took being ejected\r\n from his stomach._ I gave him two small pills as an opiate. Palmer\r\n took the pills from my house. I did not accompany, nor do I know\r\n what became of the pills. On the following morning (Sunday) Palmer\r\n again called, and asked me to accompany him. _Mr. Cook’s sickness\r\n still continued._ I remained about ten minutes. _Everything he took\r\n that morning was ejected from his stomach. Everything he threw up\r\n was as clear as water, except some coffee that he had taken._ Palmer\r\n had administered some pills before I saw Mr. Cook on Saturday, which\r\n had purged him several times. Between six and seven in the evening\r\n I again visited the deceased, accompanied by Palmer. _The sickness\r\n still continued._ I went on Monday morning between eight and nine,\r\n and changed his medicine. I sent him a draught, which relieved his\r\n sickness, and gave him ease. I did not see him again until Tuesday\r\n night, when Palmer called for me. _I examined Mr. Cook, in the\r\n presence of Mr. Jones and Mr. Palmer, and I observed a change in\r\n him. He was irritable and troubled in his mind. His pulse was firm,\r\n but tremulous, and between 80° and 90°. He threw himself down on the\r\n bed, and turned his face away. He said he would have no more pills,\r\n nor take any medicine._ After they had left the room, Palmer asked\r\n me to make two more pills, similar to those on the previous night,\r\n which I did, and he then asked me to write the directions on a slip\r\n of paper, and I gave the pills to Palmer. The effervescing mixture\r\n contained 20 grains of carbonate of potash, 2 drachms of compound\r\n tincture of cardamine, and 2 drachms of simple syrup, together with\r\n 15 grains of tartaric acid for each powder. _I never gave Mr. Cook a\r\n grain of antimony._ I did not see the preparations after they were\r\n taken away. _His skin was moist, and there was not the least fever\r\n about him._ I considered death to have been the result of congestion\r\n of the brain, when the _post-mortem_ examination was made, and I\r\n do not see any reason to alter that opinion. Palmer said he was of\r\n the same opinion with respect to the death of the deceased. I never\r\n knew apoplexy produce rigidity of the limbs. Drowsiness is a prelude\r\n to apoplexy. _I attribute the sickness on the first two days to a\r\n disordered stomach._” When called in the sixth day of the trial,\r\n after his recovery, the witness said—speaking of the last visit to\r\n Mr. Cook—“Having seen Cook, I left the room with Jones and Palmer:\r\n the latter said he rather wished Cook to have his pills again (I had\r\n prepared the same pills on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday), and he would\r\n walk up with me for them. He did so, and stood by me in the surgery\r\n while I prepared them. I had strychnia in a cupboard in my private\r\n room. I put the pills in a box, and addressed it ‘Night pills, John\r\n Parsons Cook, Esq.’ I wrote that direction all four nights. On the\r\n Tuesday night Palmer requested me to put on a direction. After that I\r\n did not see Cook alive. It was, as near as could be, twenty minutes\r\n past twelve, at midnight, when I saw Cook dead. I understood he was\r\n alive when they came for me, and I could not have been more than five\r\n or ten minutes in going up. My house is about two hundred yards from\r\n Palmer. _I found the body stretched out, resting on the heels and\r\n the back of the head, as straight as possible, and stiff. The arms\r\n were extended down each side of the body, and the hands clenched._ I\r\n certified it was apoplexy.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. William Henry Jones_, a surgeon at Lutterworth, and intimate\r\nfriend of Cook’s for the last five years, was written to by Palmer on\r\nthe Monday, the 19th, stating that “Cook was taken ill at Shrewsbury,\r\nand obliged to call in a medical man;” that “_since then he had been\r\nconfined to his bed with a very serious bilious attack, combined with\r\ndiarrhœa_,” and that Palmer “thought it advisable that his friend\r\nshould come and see him.” Illness prevented this before about half-past\r\nthree in the afternoon of Tuesday, the day before Cook died.\r\n\r\n “On my arrival at Rugeley,” said the witness, “I went up to Cook’s\r\n room. He said he was very comfortable, but had been very ill at\r\n Shrewsbury. He did not detail the symptoms, but said he had had to\r\n call in a doctor. Palmer came in. I examined Cook in his presence.\r\n _He had a natural pulse. I looked at his tongue; it was clean. I\r\n said it was hardly the tongue of a bilious, diarrhœa attack. Palmer\r\n replied, ‘You should have seen it before.’_ I did not then prescribe\r\n for Cook. In the course of the afternoon I visited him several times.\r\n _He changed for the better. His spirits and pulse both improved. I\r\n gave him, at his request, some toast and water, and he vomited. There\r\n was no diarrhœa._ The toast and water was in the room. Mr. Bamford\r\n came in the evening, about 7 o’clock, and expressed his opinion that\r\n Cook was going on very satisfactorily. We were talking about what he\r\n was to have, and Cook objected to the pills of the previous night.\r\n Palmer was there all the time. Cook said the pills made him ill. I do\r\n not remember to whom he addressed this observation. We three (Palmer,\r\n Bamford, and myself) went out upon the landing. Palmer proposed that\r\n Mr. Bamford should make up some morphine pills as before, at the\r\n same time requesting me not to mention to Cook what they contained,\r\n as he objected to the morphine so much. Mr. Bamford agreed to this,\r\n and he went away. I went back to Cook’s room, and Palmer went with\r\n me. During the evening I was several times in Cook’s room. He seemed\r\n very comfortable all the evening. _There was no more vomiting nor any\r\n diarrhœa, but there was a natural motion in the bowels. I observed no\r\n bilious symptoms about Cook._”\r\n\r\n By _Lord Campbell_.—“_Did he appear to have recently suffered from a\r\n bilious attack?_”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Examination resumed._—“Palmer and I went to his house about eight\r\n o’clock. I remained there about half-an-hour, and then returned to\r\n Cook. I next saw Palmer in Cook’s room at nearly eleven o’clock. He\r\n had brought with him a box of pills. He opened the paper on which\r\n the direction was written in my presence. That paper was round the\r\n box. He called my attention to the paper, saying, ‘What an excellent\r\n handwriting for an old man!’ I did not read the direction, but looked\r\n at the writing, which was very good. Palmer proposed to Cook that he\r\n should take the pills. Cook protested very much against it, because\r\n they had made him so ill on the previous night. Palmer repeated the\r\n request several times, and at last Cook complied with it, and took the\r\n pills. _The moment he took them he vomited into the utensil._ Palmer\r\n and myself (at Palmer’s request) searched in it for the pills, to see\r\n whether they were returned. We found nothing but toast-and-water. I do\r\n not know when Cook had drunk the toast-and-water, but it was standing\r\n by the bedside all the evening. _The vomiting could not have been\r\n caused by the contents of the pills, nor by the act of swallowing.\r\n After vomiting Cook laid down and appeared quiet. Before Palmer came\r\n Cook had got up and sat in a chair. His spirits were very good; he\r\n was laughing and joking, talking of what he should do with himself\r\n during the winter._ After he had taken the pills I went downstairs\r\n to my supper, and returned to his room at nearly twelve o’clock. His\r\n room was double-bedded, and it had been arranged that I should sleep\r\n in it that night. I talked to Cook for a few minutes, and then went\r\n to bed. When I last talked to him he was rather sleepy, but quite as\r\n well as he had been during the evening. There was nothing about him\r\n to excite any apprehensions. I had been in bed about ten minutes, and\r\n had not got to sleep, when he suddenly started up in bed, and called\r\n out, ‘Doctor, get up, I am going to be ill! Ring the bell and send\r\n for Palmer.’ I rang the bell. The chambermaid came, and Cook called\r\n out to her, ‘Fetch Mr. Palmer.’ He asked me to give him something.\r\n I declined, and said, ‘Palmer will be here directly.’ Cook was then\r\n sitting up in bed. _The room was rather dark, and I did not observe\r\n anything particular in his countenance. He asked me to rub the back of\r\n his neck. I did so. I supported him with my arm. There was a stiffness\r\n about the muscles of his neck._ Palmer soon came in; two or three\r\n minutes at the utmost after the chambermaid went for him. He said,\r\n ‘I never dressed so quickly in my life.’ I did not observe how he\r\n was dressed. _He gave Cook two pills, which he told me were ammonia\r\n pills. Cook swallowed them. Directly he did so he uttered loud\r\n screams, threw himself back in the bed, and was dreadfully convulsed.\r\n That could not have been the result of the pills last taken. He said,\r\n ‘Raise me up; I shall be suffocated.’ That was at the commencement of\r\n the convulsions, which lasted five or ten minutes. The convulsions\r\n affected every muscle of the body, and were accompanied by stiffening\r\n of the limbs. I endeavoured to raise Cook with the assistance of\r\n Palmer, but found it quite impossible, owing to the rigidity of the\r\n limbs. When Cook found we could not raise him up, he asked to be\r\n turned over. He was then quite sensible. I turned him on his side._ I\r\n listened to the action of the heart. I found it gradually weakened,\r\n and asked Palmer to fetch some spirits of ammonia, to be used as a\r\n stimulant. He went to his house and fetched a bottle. He was away a\r\n very short time. When he returned the pulsations of the heart were\r\n gradually ceasing, and life was almost extinct. He died very quietly a\r\n short time afterwards.\r\n\r\n “_From the time he called to me to the time of his death there elapsed\r\n about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. He died of tetanus_, which\r\n is a spasmodic affection of the muscles of the whole body. It causes\r\n death by stopping the action of the heart. The sense of suffocation is\r\n caused by the contraction of the respiratory muscles. The room was so\r\n dark that I could not observe the outward appearance of Cook’s body\r\n after death. _When he threw himself back in bed he clenched his teeth,\r\n and they remained clenched after his death. When I was rubbing his\r\n neck, his head and neck were unnaturally bent back by the spasmodic\r\n action of the muscles. After his death his body was so twisted or\r\n bowed that if I had placed it upon the back it would have rested on\r\n the head and feet._”\r\n\r\n By _Lord Campbell_.—“_When did you first observe the bowing and\r\n twisting?_”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“_When Cook threw himself back on the bed. The jaw was\r\n affected by the spasmodic action._”\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of this witness was directed to the previous\r\nhealth of the deceased, and to his fears that he was still suffering\r\nfrom a former attack of venereal disease, which Mr. Jones decidedly\r\nnegatived; to his having been in pecuniary difficulties from his racing\r\nventures, which the witness said he was steadily redeeming; to Cook’s\r\nobjection to take morphia; to the question whether, when before the\r\ncoroner, the witness had used the word “tetanus,” which it was evident\r\nfrom the original depositions had been scratched out by the clerk,\r\nprobably from ignorance of its meaning, and to whether he agreed with\r\nDr. Bamford that Cook had died in an apoplectic fit, or rather, as\r\nthe witness at the time thought, of one of an epileptic character. In\r\n_re-examination_, he said that “_he was satisfied that Cook’s death\r\ndid not arise from epilepsy, as in that disease consciousness is lost,\r\nbut there is no rigidity or convulsive spasm of the muscles, and the\r\nsymptoms quite different. He was equally certain that it did not arise\r\nfrom apoplexy._” _Dr. Savage_, of Gloucester Place, London, who had\r\nattended Cook for four years, also negatived the suggestion that he was\r\nsuffering from syphilitic symptoms, or that he had any venereal taint\r\nabout him. He was timid, no doubt, about his throat, and had had two\r\nsmall ulcers on his tongue due to two bad teeth, but by the end of May\r\nthey had gradually disappeared, and were quite well.\r\n\r\nThe woman who laid out the body noticed that “_though it was quite\r\nwarm, the hands and arms were cold; the body lying on the back,\r\nstraight down the bed,[35] the arms crossed upon the chest, and the\r\nhead ‘lying a little turned on one side.’” She had never seen so stiff\r\na corpse before. “We,” she continued, “had difficulty in straightening\r\nthe arms. We could not keep them straight down to the body. I passed\r\na piece of tape under the back, and tied it round the wrists, to\r\nfasten the arms down. The right foot turned on one side outwards. We\r\nwere obliged to tie both feet together. The eyes were open. We were\r\na considerable time before we could close them, because the eyelids\r\nwere so stiff. The hands were closed, and were very stiff. I have\r\nnever known them so stiff as in this case._” _Mr. Stevens_, Cook’s\r\nstepfather, who saw the body three days after death, also noted that\r\nthe right hand was clenched, and, as he looked across the body, that\r\nthe left was clenched in the same way.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between _Mr. Stevens_ and Palmer at their interview at\r\nRugeley on the Friday after Cook’s death, and the reasons why he\r\neventually insisted on a _post-mortem_ examination and a chemical\r\nanalysis of the corpse, belong rather to the section relating to the\r\nconduct of the prisoner. It will be sufficient here to note that on\r\nthe 26th of November the _post-mortem_ examination was held with\r\nthe following results by Dr. Harland, of Stafford, assisted by Mr.\r\nDevonshire, of the London University, and Mr. Newton, of Rugeley, in\r\nthe presence of Dr. Bamford, Palmer, and several other persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_POST-MORTEM_ EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n_Dr. John Thomas Harland_, physician, of Stafford, arrived at Rugeley\r\nat ten in the morning of the 26th, called at Dr. Bamford’s on his\r\nway to the hotel where the examination was to be conducted, and on\r\nhis road met Palmer, whom he had previously known. “I am glad,” said\r\nPalmer, “that you are come to make a _post-mortem_ examination. Someone\r\nmight have been sent whom I did not know.” “What is the case?” replied\r\nHarland; “I hear there is a suspicion of poisoning.” “Oh no,” said\r\nPalmer; “_he had an epileptic fit on Monday and Tuesday last, and\r\nyou will find old disease in the heart and head_.” Such was not the\r\nresult of the _post-mortem_. They “found the body much stiffer than\r\nbodies usually are five or six days after death—the muscles strongly\r\ncontracted and thrown out, and the hands stiff and firmly closed.”\r\nAccording to a report which Dr. Harland sent to Mr. Stevens, and which\r\nat the suggestion of the judge was read in full, the various internal\r\norgans were perfectly healthy and natural, as described in detail in\r\nthe following examination, subsequent to reading the report:—\r\n\r\n “The abdominal viscera were in a perfectly healthy state. They were\r\n taken out of the body. We examined the liver. It was healthy. The\r\n lungs were healthy, but contained a good deal of blood; not more than\r\n would be accounted for by gravitation after death. We examined the\r\n head. The brain was quite healthy. There was no extravasation of\r\n blood, and no serum. There was nothing which, in my judgment, could\r\n cause pressure. The heart was contracted, and contained no blood.\r\n That was the result, not of disease, but of spasmodic action. At the\r\n larger end of the stomach there were numerous small yellowish-white\r\n spots, about the size of mustard seeds. They would not at all account\r\n for death. I doubt whether they would have any effect upon the health.\r\n I think they were mucous follicles. The kidneys were full of blood\r\n which had gravitated there. They had no appearance of disease. The\r\n blood was in a fluid state. That was not usual. It is found so in some\r\n cases of sudden death, which are of rare occurrence. The lower part of\r\n the spinal cord was not very closely examined. We examined the upper\r\n part of that cord. It presented a perfectly natural appearance. On\r\n a subsequent day, I think the 25th of January, it was thought right\r\n to exhume the body, that the spinal cord might be more carefully\r\n examined. I was present at that examination. The lower part of the\r\n spinal cord was then minutely examined. A report was made of that\r\n examination.”\r\n\r\n This report was put in, and was read by the witness. It described\r\n minutely the appearance and condition of the spinal cord and its\r\n envelopes, and concluded with this statement:—“There is nothing in\r\n the condition of the spinal cord or its envelopes to account for\r\n death; nothing but the most normal and healthy state, allowance being\r\n made for the lapse of time since the death of the deceased.”\r\n\r\n _Examination resumed._—“I am still of opinion that there was nothing\r\n in the appearance of the spine to account for the death of the\r\n deceased, and nothing of an unusual kind which might not be referred\r\n to changes after death. When the stomach and intestines were removed\r\n from the body on the occasion of the first examination they were\r\n separately emptied into a jar, and were afterwards placed in it.\r\n Mr. Devonshire and Mr. Newton removed them from the body. They were\r\n the only two who operated. At the time the prisoner was standing\r\n on the right of Mr. Newton. While Mr. Devonshire was opening the\r\n stomach a push was given by Palmer, which sent Mr. Newton against Mr.\r\n Devonshire, and shook some of the contents of the stomach into the\r\n body. I thought a joke was passing among them, and said, ‘Don’t do\r\n that.’”\r\n\r\n By _Lord Campbell_.—“Might not Palmer have been impelled by some one\r\n outside him?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“There was no one who could have impelled him.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What did you observe Palmer do?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I saw Mr. Newton and Mr. Devonshire pushed together, and\r\n Palmer was over them. He was smiling at the time.”\r\n\r\n _Examination continued._—“After this interruption the opening of\r\n the stomach was pursued. The stomach contained about three ounces\r\n of a brownish fluid. There was nothing particular in that. Palmer\r\n was looking on, and said, ‘They won’t hang us yet.’ He said that to\r\n Mr. Bamford in a loud whisper. That remark was made upon his own\r\n observation of the stomach. The stomach after being emptied, was\r\n put into the jar. The intestines were then examined, but nothing\r\n particular was found in them. They were contracted and very small.\r\n The viscera, with their contents, as taken from the body, were placed\r\n in the jar, which was then covered over with two bladders, which were\r\n tied and sealed. I tied and sealed them. After I had done so I placed\r\n the jar upon the table by the body. Palmer was then moving about the\r\n room. In a few minutes I missed the jar from where I had placed it.\r\n During that time my attention had been withdrawn by the examination.\r\n On missing the jar I called out, ‘Where’s the jar?’ and Palmer from\r\n the other end of the room, said, ‘It is here; I thought it would be\r\n more convenient for you to take away.’ There was a door at the end of\r\n the room where he was. He was within a yard or two of that door, and\r\n about twenty-four feet from the table on which the body was lying.”\r\n (Before making this last statement the witness referred to a plan of\r\n the room which was put in by the Attorney-General.) “The other door\r\n near which Palmer was standing was not the one by which he entered\r\n the room. I called to Palmer, ‘Will you bring it here?’ I went from\r\n the table and met Palmer half-way coming with the jar. _Since I last\r\n saw it it had been cut through both bladders. The cut was hardly an\r\n inch long, done with a sharp instrument._ I examined the jar. The\r\n edges were quite clean; no part of the contents could have passed\r\n through it. Finding this cut, I said, ‘Here is a cut! who has done\r\n it?’ Palmer, Devonshire, and Newton, all said they had not done it,\r\n and nothing more was said. When I was about to remove the jar from the\r\n room, the prisoner asked me what I was going to do with it. I said I\r\n should take it to Mr. Frere’s (a neighbouring surgeon). He said, ‘I\r\n would rather you would take it to Stafford than take it there.’ I made\r\n no answer that I remember. On finding the slit, I cut the strings,\r\n and altered the bladder, so that the slits were not over the top. I\r\n took it to Mr. Frere’s, and left it in his hall, tied and sealed.\r\n Afterwards when I went for my carriage, whilst waiting in the yard,\r\n the prisoner came and asked me what would be done with it, and I\r\n said, ‘Sent either to Birmingham or London for examination.’ When I\r\n recovered the jar, I tied each corner separately and resealed it with\r\n my own seal. During the first _post-mortem_ examination, there were\r\n several Rugeley persons present, but, I believe, no one on behalf of\r\n the prisoner. At the second examination there was some one on behalf\r\n of Palmer (_Mr. Pemberton_ and _Mr. Bolton_).”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, after stating that Palmer’s words, “they\r\nwon’t hang us yet,” were addressed to Bamford in a loud whisper, and\r\nafterwards repeated to several persons, and that his original notes in\r\npencil were destroyed, a more formal report being written by him on\r\ngetting home, _Dr. Harland_ said—\r\n\r\n “At the base of the tongue of the deceased I observed some enlarged\r\n mucous follicles; they were not pustules containing matter, but\r\n enlarged mucous follicles of long standing. There were a good\r\n many of them, but I do not suppose that they would occasion much\r\n inconvenience. They might cause some degree of pain, but it would\r\n be slight. I do not believe they were enlarged glands. I should not\r\n say that the deceased’s lungs were diseased, although they were not\r\n in their normal state. The lungs were full of blood and the heart\r\n empty. I had no lens at the _post-mortem_ examination, but I made\r\n an examination which was satisfactory without one. The brain was\r\n carefully taken out; the membranes and external parts were first\r\n examined, and thin slices about a quarter of an inch in thickness\r\n were taken off and subjected to separate examination. I think that by\r\n that means we should have discovered disease if any had existed; and\r\n if there had been any indication of disease I should have examined it\r\n more carefully. _I examined the spinal cord as far down as possible,\r\n and if there had been any appearance of disease, I should have opened\r\n the canal. There was no appearance of disease, however. We opened\r\n down to the first vertebra. If we had found a softening of the spinal\r\n cord, I do not think that it would have been sufficient to have caused\r\n Mr. Cook’s death; certainly not. A softening of the spinal cord would\r\n not produce tetanus; it might produce paralysis. I do not think, as a\r\n medical man investigating the cause of death, that it was necessary\r\n carefully to examine the spinal cord. I do not know who suggested that\r\n there should be an examination of the spinal cord two months after\r\n death. There were some appearances of decomposition when we examined\r\n the spinal cord, but I do not think that there was sufficient to\r\n interfere with our examination._[36] I examined the body to ascertain\r\n if there was any trace of venereal disease. I did find certain\r\n indications of that description, and the marks of an old excoriation,\r\n which was cicatrized over.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by the Attorney-General._—“There were no indications\r\n of wounds or sores such as could by possibility produce tetanus.\r\n There was no disease of the lungs to account for death. The heart\r\n was healthy, and its emptiness I attribute to spasmodic action. The\r\n heart being empty, of course death ensued. The convulsive spasmodic\r\n action of the muscles of the body, which was deposed to yesterday by\r\n Mr. Jones, would, in my judgment occasion the emptiness of the heart.\r\n There was nothing whatever in the brain to indicate the presence of\r\n any disease of any sort; but if there had been, I never heard or read\r\n of any disease of the brain ever producing tetanus. _There was no\r\n relaxation of the spinal cord which would account for the symptoms\r\n accompanying Mr. Cook’s death as they have been described. In fact,\r\n there was no relaxation of the spinal cord at all, and there is no\r\n disease of the spinal cord with which I am acquainted which would\r\n produce tetanus._”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Monckton_, a physician at Rugeley, made a separate examination\r\nof the spinal marrow of the deceased on the 28th of January, when he\r\nsaid that the body was in such a condition as to enable him to do\r\nso satisfactorily, and when had there been any disease of a normal\r\ncharacter on the spine he should have had no difficulty in discovering\r\nit. All that he found were certain granules, the origin of which it\r\nwas difficult to account for, though frequently found in persons of\r\nan advanced age, but which he never knew to occasion sudden death. He\r\nagreed entirely with the evidence of Dr. Harland.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF MEDICAL EXPERTS.\r\n\r\nWe come next to a remarkable body of evidence given by men of such\r\neminence in their profession as Mr. Curling, Dr. Todd, Sir Benjamin\r\nBrodie, and others of nearly equal mark, negativing the idea that had\r\nbeen suggested in the previous cross-examinations that the death was\r\ndue to one of the two forms of true _tetanus_, and affirming that the\r\nsymptoms which had been detailed were those of the action of strychnia.\r\nNot only were these opinions closely questioned in cross-examination,\r\nbut as many medical men, several of them of not less eminence\r\nthan these witnesses, were subsequently called for the defence to\r\ncontradict them; and thus the most extraordinary conflict of scientific\r\nevidence raised that had hitherto been witnessed in a criminal court.\r\nSubsequently, as we shall see, a similar dispute between the medical\r\ngiants of the day was roused in the case of Dr. Smethurst, but with, in\r\nthe end, a very different result. In reading the following statements\r\nfor the prosecution, it will help to make them more clear, if it is\r\nborne in mind that _tetanus_ is of two kinds—(1), _Idiopathic_, or\r\nself-generated, and the other (2), _Traumatic_, the result of a wound\r\nor a sore; that the former may arise from exposure to cold or damp,\r\nor even from the irritation of worms in the alimentary canal, but\r\nin temperate climates is by no means a frequent disease; whilst the\r\nlatter, from the various accidents to which human beings are liable, is\r\nof more frequent occurrence. Another point to be remembered is, that it\r\nis a moot point in medical practice whether a syphilitic sore, unless\r\nof course of a most aggravated character, will produce _tetanus_, and\r\nthat the difference between the symptoms and progress of _true tetanus_\r\nand of that due to poison is, in the opinion of these experts, very\r\nmarked. _Dr. James Blizard Curling_, surgeon to the London Hospital,\r\nwas first called, and after describing the two kinds of _tetanus_\r\nand their causes, and speaking of the very numerous cases of the\r\n“traumatic” kind which he had seen, he thus detailed the symptoms:—\r\n\r\n “The disease first manifests itself about the jaws and neck. Rigidity\r\n of the muscles of the abdomen afterwards sets in. A dragging pain\r\n at the pit of the stomach is almost a constant attendant. In many\r\n instances the muscles of the back are extensively affected. These\r\n symptoms, though continuous, are liable to aggravations into\r\n paroxysms. As the disease goes on these paroxysms become more frequent\r\n and more severe. When they occur the body is drawn backwards; in some\r\n instances, though less frequent, it is bent forward. A difficulty\r\n in swallowing is a very common symptom, and also a difficulty of\r\n breathing during the paroxysms. The disease may, if fatal, end in\r\n two ways. The patient may die somewhat suddenly, from suffocation,\r\n owing to the closure of the opening of the windpipe; or he may be\r\n worn out by the severe and painful spasms, the muscles may relax,\r\n and the patient gradually sink. The disease is generally fatal. _The\r\n locking of the jaw is an almost constant symptom attending ‘traumatic\r\n tetanus;’ I may say a constant symptom. It is not always marked,\r\n but generally so. It is an early symptom._ Another symptom is a\r\n peculiar expression of countenance. I believe this is not peculiar\r\n to ‘_traumatic tetanus_,’ but my observation is from such cases.\r\n There is a contraction of the eyelids, a raising of the angles of the\r\n mouth, and contraction of the brow. In ‘_traumatic tetanus_’ the lower\r\n extremities are sometimes affected, and sometimes, but rarely, the\r\n upper ones. When the muscles of the extremities are affected, the time\r\n at which that occurs varies. If there is no wound in the arms or legs,\r\n the extremities are generally not affected until late in the progress\r\n of the disease. _I never knew of tetanus being produced by a sore\r\n throat or a chancre. In my opinion a syphilitic sore would not produce\r\n tetanus. I know of no instance in which one has led to tetanus. I\r\n think it a very unlikely cause._ The time within which ‘_traumatic\r\n tetanus_’ causes death varies from twenty-four hours to two or three\r\n days or longer. The shortest time to my knowledge was eight to ten\r\n hours. _When once commenced, the disease is continuous._”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Did you ever hear of a case in which a man was attacked\r\n one day, had twenty-four hours’ respite, and was then attacked the\r\n next day?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Never. Such a case could not occur.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You have heard Mr. Jones’s account of the death of\r\n the deceased. _Were the symptoms there consistent with any forms of\r\n traumatic tetanus?_”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“_No._”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“_What distinguishes it from such causes?_”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“_The sudden onset of the disease._ In all cases that\r\n have come under my observation the disease was preceded by the\r\n milder symptoms of _tetanus_, gradually proceeding to the complete\r\n development.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“_Were the symptoms described by Mills those of tetanus?_”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“_No. Not of tetanus of disease._”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Assuming tetanus to be synonymous with convulsive or\r\n spasmodic action of the muscles, was there, in that sense, _tetanus_\r\n on Monday night?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No doubt there was spasmodic action of the muscles, but\r\n not _idiopathic_ or _traumatic tetanus_, because the sudden onset of\r\n the spasms, and their rapid subsidence, are consistent with neither of\r\n the two forms of _tetanus_.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is there not _hysteric tetanus_?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes: it is rather _hysteria_ combined with spasms, but\r\n it is sometimes called _hysteric tetanus_. I have known no instance\r\n of its proving fatal, or of it occurring to a man. Some poisons will\r\n produce _tetanus_. Nux vomica, acting through its poisons, strychnia\r\n and brucia, poisons of a cognate character, produce that effect. I\r\n never saw human or animal life destroyed by strychnia.”\r\n\r\nIn his _cross-examination_, Mr. Curling admitted that irritation of\r\nthe spinal cord, or of the nerves proceeding to it, might produce\r\n_tetanus_, and the correctness of Dr. Watson’s statements in his\r\nLectures, that, in four cases out of five, the disease begins with\r\nlockjaw, and that all the symptoms of tetanic convulsions may arise\r\nfrom very trivial blows; but he denied that there was any well\r\nauthenticated instance of “_traumatic tetanus_” occurring within a\r\nquarter of an hour after the reception of the injury, or that it was\r\nvery likely that the irritation of a syphilitic sore by wet, cold,\r\ndrink, mercury, or mental excitement, might lead to _tetanic_ symptoms.\r\n\r\n “The irritation,” said Mr. Curling, “which is likely to produce\r\n _tetanus_ is the sore being exposed to friction, to which syphilitic\r\n sores in the throat are not exposed. I should class _tetanus_ arising\r\n from the irritation of a sore as _traumatic_. Cases very rarely occur\r\n which it is difficult to class as either _traumatic_ or _idiopathic_.\r\n I should class _tetanus_ arising from irritation of the intestines as\r\n _idiopathic_. The character of the spasms of epilepsy are not tetanic.”\r\n\r\n _Serjeant Shee._—“Not of the spasms; but are not the contractions of\r\n epilepsy sometimes continuous, so that the body may be twisted into\r\n various forms, and remain rigidly in them?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Not continuously.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“For five or ten minutes together?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I think not.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Does it not frequently happen that general convulsions,\r\n no cause or trace of which in the form of disease or lesion is to be\r\n found in the body after death, occur in the most violent and spastic\r\n way so as to exhibit appearances of tetanic convulsions?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No instance of the kind has come under my observation.”[38]\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you agree with this opinion of Dr. Copland, expressed\r\n in his _Dictionary of Practical Medicine_, under the head of ‘General\r\n Convulsions,’ ‘The abnormal contraction of the muscles is in some\r\n cases of the most violent and spastic nature, and frequently of some\r\n continuance, the relaxations being of brief duration or scarcely\r\n observable, and in others nearly or altogether approaching to\r\n tetanic?’”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I would rather speak from my own observation. I have not\r\n observed anything of the kind.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Does it not happen that a patient dies of convulsions,\r\n spasmodic in the sense of their being tumultuous and alternating, and\r\n chronic in the sense of exhibiting continuous rigidity, yet after\r\n death no disease is found?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It does not often happen to adults.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Does it sometimes?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I do not know, nor have I read of such a case. I have no\r\n hesitation in saying that people may die from _tetanus_ and other\r\n diseases without the appearance of morbid symptoms after death.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Are not convulsions, not, strictly speaking, tetanic,\r\n constantly preceded by retching, distention of the stomach, flatulence\r\n of the stomach and bowels, and other dyspeptic symptoms?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Such cases do not come under my observation as a hospital\r\n surgeon. I think it is very probable that general convulsions are\r\n accompanied by yelling. I don’t know that they frequently terminate\r\n fatally, and that the proximate cause of death is spasm of the\r\n respiratory muscles, inducing asphyxia.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by the Attorney-General._—“These convulsions are easily\r\n distinguished from tetanus, because in them there is an entire loss of\r\n consciousness.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is it one of the characteristic features of _tetanus_\r\n that the consciousness is not affected?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Todd_, for twenty-one years physician to King’s College Hospital,\r\nwell known for his lectures on _Tetanus_ and the diseases of the\r\nNervous System, and who had seen only two cases of what appeared to him\r\nto be _idiopathic tetanus_, so rare are they in this country, gave the\r\nfollowing evidence:[39]—\r\n\r\n “In my opinion the term _tetanus_ ought not to be applied to disease\r\n produced by poisons, but I should call the symptoms tetanic in order\r\n to distinguish the character of the convulsions. I have observed cases\r\n of _traumatic tetanus_. Except that in all such cases there is some\r\n lesion the symptoms are precisely the same as those of _idiopathic\r\n tetanus_. The disease begins with stiffness about the jaw. The\r\n symptoms gradually develope themselves and extend to the muscles of\r\n the trunk.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“When the disease has begun is there any intermission?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“There are remissions, but they are not complete; only\r\n diminutions of the severity of the symptoms, not a total subsidence.\r\n The patient does not express himself as completely well, quite\r\n comfortable. I speak from my own experience.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What is the usual period that elapses between the\r\n commencement and the termination of the disease?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“The cases may be divided into two classes. Acute cases\r\n will terminate in three or four days, chronic cases will go on as\r\n long as from nineteen to twenty-two or twenty-three days, and perhaps\r\n longer. I do not think that I have known a case in which death\r\n occurred within four days. Cases are reported in which it occurred in\r\n a shorter period. In _tetanus_ the extremities are affected, but not\r\n so much as the trunk. Their affection is a late symptom. _The locking\r\n of the jaw is an early one._ Sometimes the convulsions of epilepsy\r\n assume somewhat of a tetanic character, but they are essentially\r\n distinct from tetanus. _In epilepsy the patient always loses\r\n consciousness._ Apoplexy never produces tetanic convulsions. Perhaps\r\n I may be allowed to say that when there is an effusion of blood upon\r\n the brain, and a particular portion of the brain is involved, the\r\n muscles may be thrown into short tetanic convulsions. In such a case\r\n the consciousness would be destroyed. Having heard described the\r\n symptoms attending the death of the deceased, and the _post-mortem_\r\n examination, _I am of opinion that in this case there was neither\r\n apoplexy nor epilepsy_.”\r\n\r\nThe deposition of Dr. Bamford, before reported, was here read, his\r\ninability to attend from illness having been proved.\r\n\r\nThe _examination_ of Dr. Todd by the _Attorney-General_ was then\r\nproceeded with as follows:—\r\n\r\n “Having heard the deposition of Dr. Bamford read, _I do not believe\r\n that the deceased died from apoplexy or from epilepsy. I never knew\r\n tetanus arise either from syphilitic sores or from sore throat._ There\r\n are poisons which will produce tetanic convulsions. The principal\r\n of these poisons are nux vomica and those which contain as their\r\n active ingredients strychnia and brucia. I have never seen human\r\n life destroyed by strychnia, but I have seen animals destroyed by it\r\n frequently. The poison is usually given in a largish dose in those\r\n cases, so as to put an end to the sufferings and destroy life as soon\r\n as possible. I should not like to give a human subject a quarter of a\r\n grain. I think that it is not unlikely that half a grain might destroy\r\n life; and I believe that a grain certainly would. I think that half\r\n a grain would kill a cat. The symptoms which would ensue upon the\r\n administration of strychnine when given in solution—and I believe\r\n that poisons of that nature act more rapidly in a state of solution\r\n than in any other form—would develope themselves in ten minutes\r\n after it was taken, if the dose was a large one; if not so large,\r\n they might be half an hour or an hour before they appeared. _Those\r\n symptoms would be tetanic convulsions of the muscles—more especially\r\n those of the spine and neck; the head and back would be bent back,\r\n and the trunk would be bowed in a marked manner; the extremities also\r\n would be stiffened and jerked out. The stiffness, once set in, would\r\n never entirely disappear; but fresh paroxysms would set in, and the\r\n jerking would reappear, and death would probably ensue in a quarter of\r\n an hour or so. The difference between tetanus produced by strychnia\r\n and other tetanus is very marked. In the former case the duration\r\n of the symptoms is very short, and instead of being continuous in\r\n their development, they will subside if the dose has not been strong\r\n enough to produce death, and will be renewed in fresh paroxysms:\r\n whereas in other descriptions of tetanus the symptoms commence in\r\n a mild form, and become stronger and more violent as the disease\r\n progresses._ The difficulty experienced in breathing is common alike\r\n to _tetanus_ properly so called, and to tetanic convulsions occasioned\r\n by strychnia, arising from the pressure on the respiratory muscles.\r\n I think it is remarkable that the deceased was able to swallow, and\r\n that there was no fixing of the jaw, which would have been the case\r\n with _tetanus_ proper, resulting either from a wound or from disease.\r\n _From all the evidence that I have heard, I think that the symptoms\r\n which presented themselves in the case of Mr. Cook arose from tetanus\r\n produced by strychnia._”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Grove, Q.C._—“There are cases sloping\r\n into each other, as it were, of every grade and degree, from mild\r\n convulsions to tetanic spasms. I have published some lectures upon\r\n diseases of the brain, and I adhere to the opinion there expressed,\r\n that the state of a person suffering from _tetanus_ is identical with\r\n that which strychnia is capable of producing. _In a pathological\r\n point of view, an examination of the spinal cord shortly after death,\r\n in investigating supposed deaths from strychnia, is important. The\r\n signs of decomposition, however, could be easily distinguished from\r\n the evidence of disease which existed previously to death, but\r\n it would be difficult to distinguish in such a case whether mere\r\n softening resulted from decomposition or from pre-existing disease._\r\n There is nothing in the _post-mortem_ examination that leads me to\r\n think that the deceased died from _tetanus_ proper. _I think that\r\n granules upon the spinal cord, such as I have heard described, would\r\n not be likely to cause tetanus._ In animals to which strychnia has\r\n been administered I cannot say that I have observed what you call\r\n an intolerance of touch, but by touching them spasms are apt to be\r\n excited. That sensibility to touch continues as long as the operation\r\n of the poison continues. I have examined the interior of animals\r\n that have been killed by strychnia, but I have not observed in such\r\n cases that the right side of the heart was usually full of blood.\r\n It is some years since I made such an examination, but I am able,\r\n nevertheless, to speak positively as to the state of the heart. _It is\r\n usually empty on both sides._ I do not agree with Dr. Taylor, or other\r\n authorities, that, in cases of _tetanus_, animals died asphyxiated.\r\n If they did, we should invariably have the right side of the heart\r\n full of blood, which is not the case. I think the term asphyxiated is\r\n sometimes very loosely used. I know, from my reading, _that morphia\r\n sometimes produces convulsions, but believe they would be of an\r\n epileptic character. I think that the symptoms of morphia would be\r\n longer deferred in making their appearance than from strychnia_, but\r\n cannot speak positively on the point. Morphia, like strychnia, is a\r\n vegetable poison. I have not observed in animals the jaw fixed after\r\n the administration of strychnia.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by the Attorney-General._—“Whatever may be the true\r\n theory as to the emptiness of the heart after strychnia, I should say\r\n that the heart is more ordinarily empty than filled after _tetanus_,\r\n and more contracted after strychnia, than in ordinary _tetanus_. I do\r\n not believe that a medical practitioner would have any difficulty in\r\n distinguishing between ordinary convulsions and tetanic convulsions.\r\n I have heard the evidence of the gentlemen who made the _post-mortem_\r\n examination, and I apprehend that there was nothing to prevent the\r\n discovery of disease in the spinal cord had any existed previously to\r\n death.”\r\n\r\n_Sir Benjamin Brodie’s_ evidence, which follows, was given “with great\r\nclearness, slowly, audibly, and distinctly,” and produced a marked\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n _Sir Benjamin Brodie, examined by Mr. James, Q.C._—“I have been for\r\n many years senior surgeon to St. George’s Hospital, and have had\r\n considerable experience as a surgeon. In the course of my practice\r\n I have had under my care many cases of death from _tetanus_. Death\r\n from _idiopathic tetanus_ is, according to my experience, very\r\n rare in this country. The ordinary _tetanus_ in this country is\r\n _traumatic tetanus_. I have heard the symptoms which accompanied\r\n the death of Mr. Cook, and I am of opinion that so far as there\r\n was a general contraction of the muscles they resembled those of\r\n _traumatic tetanus_; but, as to the course those symptoms took,\r\n they were entirely different. I have attended to the detailed\r\n description of the attack suffered by Mr. Cook on the Monday night,\r\n its ceasing on Tuesday, and its renewal on the Tuesday night. The\r\n symptoms of _traumatic tetanus_ always begin, so far as I have seen,\r\n very gradually, the stiffness of the lower jaw being, I believe,\r\n invariably, the symptom first complained of—at least, so it has been\r\n in my experience. The contraction of the muscles of the back is always\r\n a later symptom—generally much later. The muscles of the extremities\r\n are affected in a much less degree than those of the neck and trunk,\r\n except in some cases where the injury has been in a limb, and an early\r\n symptom has been spasmodic contraction of the muscles of that limb. I\r\n do not myself recollect a case of ordinary _tetanus_ in which occurred\r\n that contraction in the muscles of the hand which I understand\r\n was stated to have taken place in this instance. Again, ordinary\r\n _tetanus_ rarely runs its course in less than two or three days, and\r\n often is protracted to a much longer period. I knew one case only in\r\n which the disease was said to have terminated in so short a time as\r\n twelve hours; but probably in that case the early symptoms had been\r\n overlooked. Again, I never knew the symptoms of ordinary _tetanus_\r\n to last for a few minutes, then subside, and then come on again\r\n after twenty-four hours. I think that these are the principal points\r\n of difference which I perceived between the symptoms of ordinary\r\n _tetanus_ and those which I have heard described in this case. I have\r\n not witnessed tetanic convulsions from strychnia on animal life. I\r\n do not believe that death in the case of Mr. Cook arose from what we\r\n ordinarily call _tetanus—either idiopathic or traumatic. I never knew\r\n tetanus result from sore throat or from a chancre, or from any other\r\n form of syphilitic disease. The symptoms were not the result either of\r\n apoplexy or of epilepsy. Perhaps I had better say at once that I never\r\n saw a case in which the symptoms that I have heard described here\r\n rose from any disease._ (Sensation.) _When I say that, of course I\r\n refer not to particular symptoms, but to the general course which the\r\n symptoms took._”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“I believe I remember one case\r\n in the physician’s ward of St. George’s Hospital, which was shown to\r\n me as a case of _idiopathic tetanus_, but I doubted whether it was\r\n _tetanus_ at all. It was a slight case, and I do not remember the\r\n particulars.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Considering how rare cases of _tetanus_ are, do you\r\n think that the description given by a chambermaid and a provincial\r\n medical man, who had never seen but one case, is sufficient to enable\r\n you to form an opinion as to the nature of the case?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I must say I thought that the description was very clearly\r\n given.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Supposing that they differed in their description, which\r\n would you rely upon—the medical man or the chambermaid?”\r\n\r\n _Lord Campbell._—“That is hardly a proper question.”\r\n\r\n _Baron Alderson._—“It may be a very proper observation for you to\r\n make.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examination continued._—“I never knew syphilitic poison\r\n produce tetanic convulsions, except in cases where there was disease\r\n of the bones of the head.”\r\n\r\nTwo other surgeons, _Dr. Daniell_, late surgeon to the British\r\nHospital, and _Mr. Samuel Solly_, of St. Thomas’s Hospital, confirmed\r\nin every respect the views of the previous medical witnesses, that\r\nthe circumstances attending Cook’s death were clearly distinguishable\r\nfrom those attendant on ordinary _tetanus_. They relied on the fact\r\nthat ordinary _tetanus_ was always progressive, and that it is never\r\nintermittent to the extent witnessed in Cook’s case, and seldom endured\r\nless than from thirty to forty hours. Mr. Solly alluded to the peculiar\r\ngrin—“the _risus Sardonicus_, as the first symptom of _true tetanus_,\r\nwhich is not common to all convulsions, and which having once seen,”\r\nhe said, “you cannot forget.” He distinguished between _tetanus_ with\r\nconvulsions and death from epileptic convulsions by the fact that “the\r\nfirst seldom leaves any trace behind it, whilst the latter does leave\r\nits trace in the shape of a slight effusion of blood on the brain,\r\nand a congestion of the vessels.” The syphilitic theory was finally\r\noverthrown by the testimony of _Mr. Henry Lee_, surgeon to the Lock\r\nHospital, which is exclusively devoted to syphilitic cases. Though he\r\nsaw there nearly 3000 cases a year, he had never known one resulting in\r\n_tetanus_, or read of a case of primary or secondary symptoms having\r\nthat result.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these experts, on the sixth day important evidence was\r\ngiven by _Dr. Jackson_, who had had twenty-five years’ experience of\r\n_tetanus_ in India, on the difference of the symptoms observed in\r\nthe _idiopathic_ and _traumatic_ kinds; the former being much more\r\nfrequent in India than in other climates, affording him in his practice\r\nas many as forty cases.\r\n\r\n “It is as equally fatal,” said Dr. Jackson, “according to my\r\n experience, as _traumatic_. It is frequently found, in India, in\r\n children, both natives and Europeans, and generally takes place\r\n the third day after birth. It will also be occasioned by cold in\r\n that climate. In infants there is a more marked symptom of lockjaw\r\n in _idiopathic tetanus_. In adults there is no difference in the\r\n symptoms from _traumatic_. I have always seen the _idiopathic_ form\r\n preceded by premonitory symptoms, such as a peculiar expression of the\r\n countenance, stiffness of the muscles of the throat and of the jaw.\r\n The usual period from the attack to death in infants is forty-eight\r\n hours; in adults, when arising from cold, it is of longer duration,\r\n and may continue for many days, going through the same grades as the\r\n _traumatic_ forms.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“The patient always appears\r\n to be very uncomfortable shortly before an attack of _idiopathic\r\n tetanus_. His appetite would not be affected, but he would chiefly\r\n complain of the muscles of the neck. He might entertain a desire\r\n for food, and take it as usual within twelve hours of the attack.\r\n I never heard a patient complain of want of appetite. Within the\r\n twelve hours I should say that the patient’s attention would be more\r\n directed to the stiffness of his mouth and neck. I have known cases of\r\n _idiopathic tetanus_, where the first paroxysm was in bed. Difficulty\r\n of swallowing is another premonitory symptom.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by the Attorney-General._—“In the case of a child not\r\n more than six hours would elapse between the premonitory symptoms and\r\n the tetanic convulsions; in an adult the period would not be greater\r\n than twenty-four hours. The duration of the disease generally varies\r\n from three to ten days, but death has occurred as early as two days.\r\n The _traumatic_ and _idiopathic_ cases are alike in these respects.\r\n Both forms of the disorder are much more common in India than they\r\n are in this country. The symptoms are not more severe. _In all my\r\n experience I never saw a case in which the disease ran its course in\r\n twenty minutes._”\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE EXAMPLES OF DEATH BY STRYCHNIA.\r\n\r\nFour cases of undoubted poisoning by strychnia were brought forward\r\nby the prosecution, in each of which the symptoms had been observed\r\nby medical men, as well as by the attendants on the several patients.\r\nIn the _first_ case, that of Agnes Sennett, or French, a patient in\r\nthe Glasgow Infirmary, in September, 1845, for a sore skin, from\r\nthoughtlessness apparently, she took one of two strychnia pills\r\nprepared for a paralytic patient, and then went and sat by the ward\r\nfire. “In three quarters of an hour,” said _Kelly_, another patient,\r\n“she was taken ill and fell back on the floor. I went for the nurse; we\r\ntook her to bed, and sent for the doctor; we were obliged to cut her\r\nclothes off first because she never moved. She was like a poker. She\r\nnever spoke till she died.” Each pill, according to the prescription,\r\ncontained a quarter of a grain of strychnia. When the medical clerk of\r\nthe hospital saw her in bed, the symptoms were—\r\n\r\n “_A strong retraction of the mouth; the face much suffused and red;\r\n the pupils of the eyes dilated; the head bent back; the spine curved,\r\n and the muscles rigid and hard as a board; the arms stretched out; the\r\n hands clinched; and there were severe paroxysms occurring in about a\r\n quarter of an hour. She died in about an hour and a quarter._ When I\r\n was called the paroxysms did not last so long; but they increased in\r\n severity.” “_The retraction of the mouth was continuous, but worse\r\n at times._ I do not think I observed it after death. _The hands were\r\n not clinched after death; they were semi-bent._ The symptoms appeared\r\n about thirty minutes after taking the pills. I tried to make her vomit\r\n with a feather. She only vomited partially after I had given her an\r\n emetic. _There was spasmodic action and grinding of the teeth. She\r\n could open her mouth and swallow. There was no lockjaw or ordinary\r\n tetanus._”[40]\r\n\r\n_Dr. Watson_, the surgeon to the infirmary, who was called in within\r\na quarter of an hour of the patient being taken ill, said, “_She was\r\nin violent convulsions, and her arms stretched out and rigid; they\r\nwere kept quiet by rigidity. She did not breathe, the muscles being\r\nkept still by tetanic rigidity._ That paroxysm subsided, and fresh\r\nones came on after a short interval. She died in about half an hour.\r\nShe was perfectly conscious. Her body was opened. _The heart was found\r\ndistended and stiff. The cavities of it were empty._ The spinal cord\r\nwas healthy.”\r\n\r\nThe _second_ case, also of accidental poisoning, by the error of a\r\nlocal chemist, who substituted strychnia for salicine (willow bark), of\r\nwhich there ought to have been nine grains in the bottle of medicine,\r\nwas that of a Mrs. Sergeantson Smyth, residing near Romsey. On the 30th\r\nof October, 1848, she took half a wine-glass of the mixture, equal to\r\na third of the whole, containing three grains of strychnia. The effect\r\nwas of course immediate. The symptoms were identical with Cook’s.\r\n\r\n “I left the room,” said _Hickson_, the lady’s maid, “when I had given\r\n it her. Five or ten minutes afterwards I was alarmed by the ringing of\r\n her bell. I went into her room and found her out of bed leaning upon a\r\n chair in her night-dress. I thought she had fainted. She appeared to\r\n suffer from what I thought were spasms. I ran and sent the coachman\r\n for Dr. Taylor, and returned to her. Some of the other servants were\r\n there assisting her. _She was lying on the floor. She screamed loudly,\r\n and her teeth were clinched. She asked to have her arms and legs held\r\n straight. I took hold of them; they were very much drawn up. She still\r\n screamed and was in great agony. She requested that water should be\r\n thrown over her, and I threw some. I put a bottle of hot water to her\r\n feet, but it did not relax them. Shortly before she died she said she\r\n felt easier. The last words she uttered were, ‘Turn me over.’ She died\r\n very quietly. She was quite conscious, and knew me during the whole\r\n time. About an hour and a quarter after I gave her the medicine she\r\n died._”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Grove, Q.C._—“She could not sit up from the\r\n time I went to her till she died. It was when she was in a paroxysm\r\n that I tried to straighten her limbs. The effect of the cold water was\r\n to throw her into a paroxysm. It was a continually recurring attack,\r\n lasting about an hour and a quarter. Her teeth were clinched the whole\r\n time.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined._—“She was stiff all the time till within a few minutes\r\n of her death. She was conscious all the time.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Francis Taylor_, of Romsey, found her dead on his arrival. “Her\r\nbody was on the floor by the bed; _the hands very much bent; the feet\r\ncontracted and turned inwards; the soles of the feet hollowed up and\r\nthe toes contracted, apparently from recent spasmodic action; the inner\r\nedge of each foot was turned; there was a remarkable rigidity about\r\nthe limbs; the body was warm, and the eyelids almost adherent to the\r\neyeballs._” Three days afterwards the witness made a _post-mortem_\r\nexamination, with the following results:—\r\n\r\n “The contraction of the feet continued, but it had gone off somewhat\r\n from the rest of the body. I found no disease in the body. _The heart\r\n was contracted, and perfectly empty_, as were all the large arteries\r\n leading from it. I analysed the medicine she had taken with another\r\n medical man. It contained a large quantity of strychnia. It had\r\n originally contained nine grains; she had taken a third—three grains.\r\n I made a very casual examination of the stomach and bowels, as we had\r\n plenty of proof that poison had been taken, without the use of tests.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“In cases of death from\r\n ordinary causes the body is much distorted. It does not generally\r\n remain in the same position. If the body is not laid out immediately,\r\n probably it is stiffened by the _rigor mortis_. The ankles were tied\r\n by a bandage to keep them together. I commenced to open the body by\r\n the thorax and abdomen. The head also was opened.”\r\n\r\nThe _third_ case was that of a Mr. Clutterbuck, a gentleman suffering\r\nfrom paralysis, on whom, with _Dr. Chambers_, _Mr. E. D. Moore_, who\r\ndetailed the case, had attended some fifteen years before.\r\n\r\n “We had been giving him,” said the witness, “small doses of strychnia,\r\n when he went to Brighton. On his return he told us he had taken larger\r\n doses of it, and we in consequence gave him a stronger dose. I made\r\n up three draughts of a quarter of a grain each. He took one in my\r\n presence. I remained with him a little time, and he said he felt quite\r\n comfortable. About three quarters of an hour afterwards I was summoned\r\n to him. _I found him stiffened in every limb, and the head drawn back.\r\n He was desirous we should move him, and turn him and rub him._ We\r\n tried to give him ammonia in a spoon, _and he snapped at it_. He was\r\n suffering, I should say, more than three hours. Sedatives were given\r\n to him. He survived the attack. _He was conscious all the time._”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“The spasms ceased in about\r\n three hours, but the rigidity of the muscles remained till the next\r\n day. His hands were at first drawn back, and he was much easier when\r\n we got them round clinched together. His paralysis was better after\r\n the attack.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by the Attorney-General._—“Strychnia stimulates the\r\n nerves which act upon the voluntary muscles, and therefore acts\r\n beneficially in cases of paralysis.”\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_ case of poisoning by strychnia, though at this time given\r\nanonymously, as it had not as yet been brought to a public trial, was\r\nthat of Mrs. Dove, of Leeds, more fully related in the next report. In\r\nthis case, _Mrs. Witham_, who had been in attendance on the deceased,\r\ndescribed how, after taking the medicine given to her, “_She complained\r\nfirst of her back; her head was thrown back; her body stretched out;\r\nthat she twitched, her eyes were drawn aside, staring, and that when\r\nthe witness put her hands on the patient’s limbs they did not relax._”\r\nIn this case the illness commenced on the 25th of February; attacks\r\ncame on the 27th, 28th, and 29th (the last a very slight one), and then\r\nagain, about a quarter past eight, on the 1st of March, and the person\r\ndied about twenty minutes to eleven on that night. “She principally\r\ncomplained of prickings in the legs, twitchings in the muscles and in\r\nthe hands, which she said she could compare to nothing else than a\r\ngalvanic shock. Between the attacks, she was composed. _She wished her\r\nhusband to rub her legs and arms._ She was dead when the doctor came.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, the witness said that the sufferer “_could not\r\nbear to have her legs touched when the spasms were strong upon her. Her\r\nlimbs were rigidly extended when she asked to be rubbed between the\r\nintervals of the spasms. Touching her then brought on the spasms. Her\r\nbody was stiff immediately after death_,” but how long it continued so\r\nthe witness could not say, as she did not stay long. _She was sensible\r\nfrom half an hour to an hour_, from a quarter past eight till after\r\nnine, and the witness _supposed she was insensible the remainder of the\r\ntime; she did not speak_. On the Saturday before she died the symptoms\r\nwere the same as on the other days—not more violent.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Morley_, the surgeon who had attended this case, and whose opinion\r\nas to the symptoms being identical with those in the present inquiry,\r\nwas directly opposed by _Mr. Nunneley_, of Leeds, who had then assisted\r\nhim in the _post-mortem_ examination, not only detailed the symptoms he\r\nthen saw, but also the method and results of his subsequent examination\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n “I had attended,” said Mr. Morley, “on the lady to whom the last\r\n witness has alluded for about two months before her death. On the\r\n Monday before she died she was in her bed, apparently comfortable,\r\n when I observed (as I stood by her side) _several slight convulsive\r\n twitchings of her arms_. I supposed they arose from hysteria, and\r\n ordered medicine in consequence. _The same symptoms appeared on the\r\n following Wednesday and Thursday._ I saw her on Saturday, the day she\r\n died. She was apparently better and quite composed in the middle of\r\n the day. She complained of an attack she had had at night. She spoke\r\n of pain and spasms in her back and neck, and of shocks. I and another\r\n medical man were sent for hastily on Saturday night. We were met by\r\n an announcement that the lady was dead. On the Monday I accompanied\r\n another medical gentleman (Nunneley) to the _post-mortem_ examination.\r\n We found no disease in any part of the body which would account for\r\n death. There was no emaciation, wound, or sore. _There was a peculiar\r\n expression of anxiety in the countenance. The hands were bent and\r\n the fingers curved. The feet were strongly arched._ We carefully\r\n examined the stomach and its contents for poison. We applied several\r\n tests—nitric acid, followed by protochloride of tin,[41] sulphuric\r\n acid, followed by bichromate of potash in a liquid and also in a solid\r\n state. They are the best tests to detect strychnia. In each case we\r\n found appearances characteristic of strychnia. We administered the\r\n strychnia taken from the stomach to animals by inoculation—to two\r\n mice, two rabbits, and a guinea-pig, having first separated it by\r\n chemical analysis. We observed in each of the animals more or less\r\n of the effects produced by strychnia, namely—_general uneasiness,\r\n difficult breathing, convulsions of a tetanic kind, muscular rigidity,\r\n arching backwards of the head and neck, violent stretching out of the\r\n legs._ These symptoms appeared in some of the animals in four or five\r\n minutes, in others in less than an hour. The guinea-pig suffered but\r\n slightly at first, and was left, and was dead next day. The symptoms\r\n were strongly marked in the rabbits. After death there was an interval\r\n of flaccidity, after which rigidity commenced, more than if it had\r\n been occasioned by the _rigor mortis_. I afterwards made numerous\r\n experiments on animals with exactly similar results, the poison being\r\n administered in a fluid form.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Grove._—“I did not see the patient during a\r\n severe attack. I have observed in animals that spasms are brought on\r\n by touch. That is a very marked symptom. The spasm is like a galvanic\r\n shock. The patient was not at all insensible during the time I saw\r\n her, and she was able to swallow, but I did not see her during a\r\n severe attack. After death we found the lungs very much congested.\r\n There was a small quantity of bloody serum found in the pericardium.\r\n The muscles of the whole body were dark and soft. There was a decided\r\n quantity of effusion in the brain. There was also a quantity of serum\r\n tinged with blood in the membranes of the spinal cord. The membranes\r\n of the spinal marrow were congested to a considerable extent. We\r\n opened the head first, and there was a good deal of blood flowing\r\n out. _Part of the blood may have flowed from the heart. That might\r\n partially empty the heart, and would make it uncertain whether the\r\n heart was full or empty at the time of death. I have often examined\r\n the hearts of animals poisoned by strychnia. The right side of the\r\n heart is generally full._ In some cases I think that the symptoms\r\n did not appear for an hour after the administration of the poison. I\r\n have made the experiments in conjunction with Mr. Nunneley. We have\r\n made experiments upon frogs, but they are different in many respects\r\n from warm-blooded animals. I have in almost all cases found the\r\n strychnia where it was known to have been administered. In one case\r\n it was doubtful. We were sure the strychnia had been administered\r\n in that case, but we doubted whether it had reached the stomach.\r\n There were appearances which might lead one to infer the presence of\r\n strychnia, but they were not satisfactory. I have detected strychnia\r\n in the stomach nearly two months after death, when decomposition has\r\n proceeded to a considerable extent.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by the Attorney-General._—“From half a grain to a grain\r\n has been administered to cats, rabbits, and dogs. From one to two\r\n grains is quite sufficient to kill a dog.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“How does the strychnia act? Is it taken up by the\r\n absorbents, and carried into the system?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I think it acts upon the nerves, but a part may be taken\r\n into the blood and act through the blood. We generally examined\r\n the stomach of the animals when the poison had been administered\r\n internally. Sometimes we examined the skin. The poison found in the\r\n stomach would be in excess of that absorbed into the system.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Are you then of opinion that, a portion of the poison\r\n being taken into the system and a portion being left in the stomach,\r\n the portion taken into the system would produce tetanic symptoms and\r\n death?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee_ objected to a question which suggested a theory.\r\n\r\n _The Attorney-General._—“What would be the operation of that portion\r\n of the poison which is taken into the system?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It would destroy life.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Baron Alderson._—“And yet leave an excess in the stomach?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“That is my opinion.”\r\n\r\n _The Attorney-General._—“Would the excess remaining in the stomach\r\n produce no effect?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I am not sure that strychnia could lie in the stomach\r\n without acting prejudicially.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Suppose that a minimum quantity is administered, which,\r\n being absorbed into the system, destroys life, should you expect to\r\n find any in the stomach?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I should expect sometimes to fail in discovering it.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“If death resulted from a series of minimum doses spread\r\n over several days, would the appearance of the body be different from\r\n that of one whose death had been caused by one dose?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I should connect the appearance of the body with the final\r\n struggle of the last day.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Would you expect a different set of phenomena in cases\r\n where death had taken place after a brief struggle, and in cases where\r\n the struggle had been protracted?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Certainly. At the _post-mortem_ examination of which I\r\n have spoken we found fluid blood in the veins.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“Is it your theory that in the action of\r\n poisoning the poison becomes absorbed and ceases to exist as poison?”\r\n\r\n Answer.—“I have thought much upon that question, and have not formed\r\n a decided opinion, but I am inclined to think that it is so. A part\r\n may be absorbed and a part remain in the stomach unchanged.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“What chymical reason can you give for your\r\n opinion that strychnia, after having effected the operation of\r\n poisoning, ceases to be strychnia in the blood?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“My opinion rests upon the general principle that, in\r\n acting upon living bodies, organic substances—such as food and\r\n medicine—are generally changed in their composition.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“What are the component parts of strychnia?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Baron Alderson._—“You will find that in any cyclopædia, brother\r\n Shee.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“Have you any reason to believe that strychnia\r\n can be decomposed by any sort of putrefying or fermenting process?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I doubt whether it can.”[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day, the late _Doctor Alfred Swaine Taylor_, the\r\nwell-known Analytical Chemist and Author of “Medical Jurisprudence”\r\n(the text-book of the legal profession in all criminal investigations),\r\n_Doctor Owen Rees_, now one of the physicians extraordinary to her\r\nMajesty, and the late _Professor Brande_, of the Royal Institution,\r\nwere called as witnesses. By the two first, the analytical examination\r\nof the various parts of Mr. Cook’s body had been conducted, and they\r\nhad made a joint report of the results. By the last, that report had\r\nbeen carefully examined, and he had also heard all the evidence as to\r\nsymptoms previously given in the case. No inconsiderable portion of the\r\n_cross-examination_ of Dr. Taylor was occupied by questions connected\r\nwith the publication, in the _Illustrated Times_, by Mr. Augustus\r\nMayhew, of what professed to be statements as to the details of their\r\nanalysis by Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees, in which, if correctly reported,\r\nthe former had committed himself somewhat prematurely to opinions\r\non the case, and had used expressions towards the prisoner which,\r\nto say the least, were not discreet. Dr. Taylor, however, stoutly\r\nmaintained that he had not used many of the expressions objected to;\r\nthat the opportunity of interviewing him, after the American fashion,\r\nhad been unfairly obtained, and the pretended report published not\r\nonly without, but contrary to, his expressed wish. Except, however,\r\nas throwing a shade of partisanship over his conduct, and so far\r\nlessening the value of his evidence, the whole episode was useless to\r\nthe defence—perhaps, to a certain extent, injurious. Dr. Taylor had\r\nbeen hasty and injudicious, and undoubtedly taken at an advantage by\r\nthe energetic reporter, who certainly obtained his interview with him\r\nby pretences not strictly true.[43] With these remarks, due to Dr.\r\nTaylor’s reputation and abilities, we proceed to give his evidence.\r\n\r\n _Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor, examined by the Attorney-General._—“I\r\n am a fellow of the College of Physicians, lecturer on medical\r\n jurisprudence at Guy’s Hospital, and the author of the well-known\r\n treatise on poisons and on medical jurisprudence. I have made the\r\n poison called strychnia the subject of my attention. It is the\r\n produce of the nux vomica, which also contains brucia, a poison\r\n of an analogous character. Brucia is variously estimated at from\r\n one-sixth to one-twelfth the strength of strychnia. Most varieties of\r\n impure strychnia that are sold contain more or less brucia. Unless,\r\n therefore, you are certain as to the purity of the article, you may be\r\n misled as to its strength. I have performed a variety of experiments\r\n with strychnia on animal life. I have never witnessed its action on\r\n a human subject. I have tried its effects upon animal life—upon\r\n rabbits—in ten or twelve instances. The symptoms are, on the whole,\r\n very uniform. The quantity I have given has varied from half a grain\r\n to two grains. Half a grain is sufficient to destroy a rabbit. I have\r\n given it both in a solid and liquid state. When given in a fluid state\r\n it produces its effects in a very few minutes; when in a solid state,\r\n as a sort of pill or bolus, in about six to eleven minutes. The time\r\n varies according to the strength of the dose, and also to the strength\r\n of the animal.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“In what way does it operate, in your opinion?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is first absorbed into the blood, then circulated\r\n through the body, and especially acts on the spinal cord, from which\r\n proceed the nerves acting on the voluntary muscles.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Supposing the poison has been absorbed, what time would\r\n you give for the circulating process?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“The circulation of the blood through the whole system is\r\n considered to take place about once in four minutes. The circulation\r\n in animals is quicker. The absorption of the poison by rabbits is\r\n therefore quicker. The time would also depend on the state of the\r\n stomach,—whether it contained much food or not, whether the poison\r\n came into immediate contact with the inner surface of the stomach.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“In your opinion, does the poison act immediately on the\r\n nervous system, or must it first be absorbed?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It must first be absorbed.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“The symptoms, you say, are uniform. Will you describe\r\n them?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“The animal for about five or six minutes does not appear\r\n to suffer, but moves about gently; when the poison begins to act it\r\n suddenly falls on its side; there is a trembling, a quivering motion\r\n of the whole of the muscles of the body, arising from the poison\r\n producing violent and involuntary contraction. There is then a sudden\r\n paroxysm or fit, the fore legs and the hind legs are stretched out,\r\n the head and the tail are drawn back in the form of a bow, the jaws\r\n are spasmodically closed, the eyes are prominent; after a short time\r\n there is a slight remission of the symptoms, and the animal appears\r\n to lie quiet, but the slightest noise or touch reproduces another\r\n convulsive paroxysm; sometimes there is a scream, or a sort of shriek,\r\n as if the animal suffered from pain; the heart beats violently\r\n during the fit, and after a succession of these fits the animal dies\r\n quietly. Sometimes, however, the animal dies during a spasm, and I\r\n only know that death has occurred from holding my hand over the heart.\r\n The appearances after death differ. In some instances the rigidity\r\n continues. In one case the muscles were so strongly contracted for a\r\n week afterwards, that it was possible to hold the body by its hind\r\n legs stretched out horizontally. In an animal killed the other day\r\n the body was flaccid at the time of death, but became rigid about\r\n five minutes afterwards. I have opened the bodies of animals thus\r\n destroyed.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Could you detect any injury in the stomach?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No. I have found in some cases congestion of the membranes\r\n of the spinal cord to a greater extent than would be accounted for\r\n by the gravitation of the blood. In other cases I have found no\r\n departure from the ordinary state of the spinal cord and the brain.\r\n I ascribe congestion to the succession of fits before death. In a\r\n majority of instances, three out of five, I found no change in the\r\n abnormal condition of the spine. In all cases the heart has been\r\n congested, especially the right side. I saw a case of ordinary tetanus\r\n in the human subject years ago, but I have not had much experience of\r\n such cases. I saw one case last Thursday week at St. Bartholomew’s\r\n Hospital. The patient recovered.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You have heard the description given by the witnesses of\r\n the symptoms and appearances which accompanied Cook’s attacks?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I have.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Were those symptoms and appearances the same as those\r\n you have observed in the animals to which you administered strychnia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“They were. Death has taken place in the animals more\r\n rapidly when the poison has been administered in a fluid than in a\r\n solid form. They have died at various periods after the administration\r\n of the poison. The experiments I have performed lately have been\r\n entirely in reference to solid strychnia. In the first case the\r\n symptoms began in seven minutes, and the animal died (including those\r\n seven) in thirteen minutes. In the second case the symptoms appeared\r\n in nine minutes, and the animal died in seventeen. In the third case\r\n the symptoms appeared in ten minutes, and the animal died in eighteen.\r\n In the fourth case the symptoms appeared in five minutes, and death\r\n took place in twenty-two. In the fifth case the symptoms appeared in\r\n twelve minutes, and death occurred in twenty-three. If the poison were\r\n taken by the human subject in pills it would take a longer time to\r\n act, because the structure of the pill must be broken up in order to\r\n bring the poison in contact with the mucous membrane of the stomach. I\r\n have administered it to rabbits in pills.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Would poison given in pills take a longer period to\r\n operate on a human subject than on a rabbit?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I do not think we can draw any inference from a comparison\r\n of the rapidity of death in a human subject and in a rabbit. The\r\n circulation and absorption are different in the two cases. There is\r\n also a difference between one human subject and another. The strength\r\n of the dose, too, would make a difference, as a large dose would\r\n produce a more rapid effect than a small one. I have experimented\r\n upon the intestines of animals, in order to reproduce the strychnia.\r\n The process consists in putting the stomach and its contents in\r\n alcohol, with a small quantity of acid which dissolves the strychnia,\r\n and produces sulphate of strychnia in the stomach. The liquid is\r\n then filtered, gently evaporated, and an alkali added—carbonate of\r\n potash, which combines with the sulphuric acid, and precipitates the\r\n strychnia. Tests are applied to the strychnia, or supposed strychnia,\r\n when extracted. Strychnia has a peculiar strongly bitter taste. It is\r\n not soluble in water, but it is in acids and in alcohol. The colour\r\n tests are applied to the dry residue after evaporation. Change of\r\n colour is produced by a mixture of sulphuric acid and bichromate of\r\n potash. It produces a blue colour, changing to violet and purple,\r\n and passing to red; but colouring tests are very fallacious, with\r\n this exception,—when we have strychnia separated in its crystallised\r\n state we can recognise the crystals by their form and their chemical\r\n properties, and, above all, by the tetanic symptoms and death when\r\n administered through a wound in the skin of animals.”[44]\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Are there other vegetable substances from which, if\r\n these colouring tests were applied, similar colours could be obtained?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“There are a variety of mixtures which produce similar\r\n colours;[45] one of them also has a bitter taste like strychnine.[46]\r\n Vegetable poisons are more difficult of detection than mineral: the\r\n tests are far more fallacious. I have endeavoured to discover the\r\n presence of strychnine in animals I have poisoned in four cases,\r\n assisted by Dr. Rees. I have applied the process I first described.\r\n I have applied the tests of colouring and taste. In one case I\r\n discovered some by the colour test. In a second case there was a\r\n bitter taste, but no other indication of strychnine. In the other two\r\n cases there were no indications at all. In the case where it had been\r\n discovered by the colour test, two grains had been administered; and\r\n in the second case, where there was a bitter taste, one grain. In one\r\n of the cases where we failed to detect it, one grain, and, in the\r\n other, half a grain had been given. I account for the absence of any\r\n indication, _because it is absorbed in the blood, and is no longer\r\n in the stomach. It is in a great part changed in the blood._ When\r\n administered in large doses there is a retention of some in excess of\r\n what is required for the destruction of life.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Supposing a minimum dose, which will destroy life, has\r\n been given, could you find any?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No. It is taken up by absorption, and is no longer\r\n discoverable in the stomach. The smallest quantity by which I have\r\n destroyed an animal is half a grain. _There is no process with which I\r\n am acquainted by which it can be discovered in the tissue._[47] As far\r\n as I know, a small quantity cannot be discovered.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Suppose half a grain to be absorbed into the blood, what\r\n proportion does it bear to the total quantity of blood circulated in\r\n the system?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Assuming the system to contain the lowest quantity of\r\n blood—25lb.—it would be one-fiftieth of a grain to a pound of blood.\r\n A physician once died from a dose of half a grain in twenty minutes.\r\n _I believe it undergoes some partial change in the blood which\r\n increases the difficulty of discovering it. I never heard of its being\r\n separated from the tissues in a crystallised state._ The crystals are\r\n peculiar in form, but there are other organic crystallised substances\r\n like them, so that a chemist will not rely on form only. After the\r\n _post-mortem_ examination, a portion of the stomach was delivered to\r\n me by Mr. Boycott, covered with bladder, tied and sealed. The jar\r\n contained the stomach and the intestines. I have experimented upon\r\n them with a view to discover if any poison was present. I sought for\r\n prussic acid, morphia, strychnia, veratria, tobacco poison, hemlock,\r\n arsenic, antimony, mercury, and other mineral poisons, but only\r\n found small traces of antimony. _The parts on which I had to operate\r\n were in the most unfavourable condition that could possibly be. The\r\n stomach had been cut completely from end to end; all the contents were\r\n gone, and the fine mucous surface, on which any poison, if present,\r\n would have been found, was lying in contact with the outside of the\r\n intestines—all thrown together. The inside of the stomach was lying\r\n in a mass of intestinal fœcal matter._ That was, I presume, the fault\r\n or misfortune of the person who dissected, but it seemed to have been\r\n shaken about in every possible way in its journey to London.[48] By\r\n my request the spleen, two kidneys, and a small bottle of blood, were\r\n sent up to me. We had no idea where the blood came from. _Each part of\r\n the liver, one kidney, and the spleen, all yielded antimony._ It was\r\n reproduced, or brought out by boiling the animal matter in a mixture\r\n of hydrochloric acid and water. Copper, in the shape of foil and gauze\r\n in a sort of web of fine copper, was introduced, and the antimony was\r\n found deposited on the copper. _The quantity of antimony was less in\r\n proportion in the spleen than in the other parts. I detected some\r\n antimony in the blood._ We applied the tests of Professor Brande, Dr.\r\n Rees, and others. _It is impossible to say how recently it had been\r\n administered, but I should say shortly before death, that is, within\r\n some days._ The longest period at which antimony can be found in the\r\n blood after death, within my knowledge, is eight days; the earliest\r\n period, within my knowledge, eighteen hours. A boy died within\r\n eighteen hours after taking it, and it was found in his liver. It is\r\n usually given in the form of tartar emetic; it acts as an irritant,\r\n and produces vomiting. If given in repeated doses, a portion would\r\n find its way into the blood and the system, beyond what was ejected.\r\n If it continued to be given after it had produced certain symptoms, it\r\n would destroy life. It may, however, be given with impunity.”\r\n\r\nReferring to the symptoms previously proved in Cook’s case, the witness\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n “Vomitings produced by antimony would cause those symptoms. If given\r\n in small quantities, sufficient to cause vomiting, it would not affect\r\n the colour of the liquid with which it was mixed, whether brandy,\r\n wine, broth, or water. _It is impossible to form an exact judgment\r\n when the antimony was administered, but it must have been two or\r\n three weeks at the outside before death. There was no evidence that\r\n it was administered within some hours before death._ It might leave\r\n a sensation in the throat—a choking sensation—if a large quantity\r\n was given at once. _I found no trace of mercury during the analysis.\r\n If a few grains had been taken recently before death, I should\r\n have expected to find some trace. If a man had taken mercury for a\r\n syphilitic affection within two or three weeks, I should have expected\r\n to find it._ It is very slow in passing out of the body. As small a\r\n quantity as three or four grains might leave some trace. I recollect a\r\n case in which three grains of calomel were given three or four hours\r\n before death, and traces of mercury were found. Half a grain three or\r\n four days before death, if given in divided doses more favourable for\r\n absorption, would, I should expect, leave a trace. One grain would\r\n certainly do so.” The witness agreed with the opinion of the other\r\n witnesses as to the causes of the deaths of Mrs. Smyth, Agnes French,\r\n and the other lady (Mrs. Dove), and of the attack of Clutterbuck,\r\n and that the symptoms in Mr. Cook’s case appeared to be of a similar\r\n character. As a professor of medical science, he did not know any\r\n cause in the range of human disease, except strychnia, to which the\r\n symptoms in Cook’s case could be referred.\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of _Dr. Taylor_ was necessarily very diffuse\r\nand lengthy; with the exception, however, of the part in which it was\r\nsought to raise a prejudice against the witness as a partisan, to\r\nwhich I have previously referred, it was so important that, like the\r\n_examination_ in chief, it must, in justice to all parties, be reported\r\nat length.\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“I mean by the word ‘trace’ a\r\n very small quantity, which can hardly be estimated by weight. I do\r\n not apply it in the sense of an imponderable quantity. In chemical\r\n language it is frequently used in that sense. An infinitesimal\r\n quantity would be called ‘a trace.’ _The quantity of antimony that\r\n we discovered in all parts of the body would make up about half a\r\n grain. We did not ascertain that there was that quantity, but I will\r\n undertake to say that we extracted as much as half a grain. That\r\n quantity would not be sufficient to cause death._ Only arsenic or\r\n antimony could have been deposited, under the circumstances, on the\r\n copper, and no sublimate of arsenic was obtained.” [The witness, in\r\n reply to a further question, detailed the elaborate test which he had\r\n applied to the deposit, in order to ascertain that it consisted of\r\n antimony.]\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Would a mistake in any one of the processes you have\r\n described, or a defect in any of the materials you have used, defeat\r\n the object of the test?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It would, but all the materials I used were pure. Such an\r\n accident could not have happened without my having some intimation of\r\n it in the course of the process. I should think antimony would operate\r\n more quickly upon animals than upon men. I am acquainted with the\r\n works of Orfila. He stood in the highest rank of analytical chemists.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Did not Orfila find antimony in a dog four months after\r\n injection?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes; but the animal had taken about forty-five grains.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee_ called the attention of the witness to a passage\r\n in Orfila’s work in reference to that case, to the effect that the\r\n antimony was found accumulating in the bones, the liver contained a\r\n great deal, and the tissues a very little.\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes; when antimony has been long in the body it passes\r\n into the bones; but I think you will find that these are not Orfila’s\r\n experiments. Orfila is quoting the experiments of another person.”[49]\r\n\r\n _Question._—“But is not that the case with nearly all the experiments\r\n referred to in your own book?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; I cannot say that.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee_ again referred to a case in Orfila in which\r\n forty-five grains were given to a dog, and three and a half months\r\n after death a quantity was found in the fat, and some in the liver,\r\n bones, and tissues.\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“That shows that antimony gets into the bones and flesh,\r\n but I never knew a case in which forty-five grains had been given to a\r\n human being in ten days, and I have given no opinion upon such a case.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“A pretty good dose is required to poison a person, I\r\n suppose?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“That depends on the mode in which it is given. A dog has\r\n been poisoned with six grains. The dog died in the case you mentioned.\r\n When antimony is administered as it was in that case the liver becomes\r\n fatty and gristled. Cook’s liver presented no appearance of the sort.\r\n _I should infer that the antimony we found in Cook’s body was given\r\n much more recently than in the experiments you have described. We\r\n cannot say positively how long it takes to get out of the body, but\r\n I have known three grains cleared out in twenty-four hours._ I was\r\n first applied to in this case on Thursday, the 27th of November, by\r\n Mr. Stevens, who was introduced to me by Mr. Warrington, professor of\r\n chemistry. Either then or subsequently he mentioned Mr. Gardner. I had\r\n not known Mr. Gardner before. I had never before been concerned in\r\n cases of this kind at Rugeley.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee_ read the letter written by Dr. Taylor to Mr.\r\n Gardner:\r\n\r\n  “CHEMICAL LABORATORY, GUY’S HOSPITAL,\r\n  “_Dec. 4, 1855_.\r\n\r\n  “_Re_ J. P. Cook, Esq., _deceased_.\r\n\r\n “DEAR SIR,—Dr. Rees and I have completed the analysis to-day. We have\r\n sketched a report, which will be ready to-morrow or next day.\r\n\r\n “As I am going to Durham Assizes on the part of the Crown, in the case\r\n of _Reg._ v. _Wooler_, the report will be in the hands of Dr. Rees,\r\n No. 26, Albemarle-street. It will be most desirable that Mr. Stevens\r\n should call on Dr. Rees, read the report with him, and put such\r\n questions as may occur.\r\n\r\n “In reply to your letter received here this morning I beg to say that\r\n we wish a statement of all the medicines prescribed for deceased\r\n (until his death) to be drawn up and sent to Dr. Rees.\r\n\r\n “We do not find strychnine, prussic acid, or any trace of opium. From\r\n the contents having been drained away it is now impossible to say\r\n whether any strychnine had or had not been given just before death,\r\n but it is quite possible for tartar emetic to destroy life if given in\r\n repeated doses; and, so far as we can at present form an opinion, in\r\n the absence of any natural cause of death, the deceased may have died\r\n from the effects of antimony in this or some other form.\r\n\r\n  “We are, dear Sir, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n  “ALFRED S. TAYLOR.\r\n  “G. OWEN REES.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Was that your opinion at the time?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“It was. We could infer nothing else.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Have you not said that the quantity of antimony you found\r\nwas not sufficient to account for death?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“Certainly. If a man takes antimony he first vomits, and\r\nthen a part of the antimony goes out of the body; some may escape from\r\nthe bowels. A great deal passes at once into the blood by absorption,\r\nand is carried out by the urine.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Can you say upon your oath that from the traces in Cook’s\r\nbody you were justified in stating your opinion that death was caused\r\nby antimony?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“Yes; perfectly and distinctly. _That which is found in a\r\ndead body is not the slightest criterion as to what the man took when\r\nalive._”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“When you gave your opinion that Cook died from the\r\neffects of antimony, had you any reason to think that an undue quantity\r\nhad been administered?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“I could not tell. People may die from large or small\r\nquantities; the quantity found in the body was no criterion as to how\r\nmuch he had taken.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“May not the injudicious use of a quack medicine\r\ncontaining antimony, the injudicious use of James’s powders, account\r\nfor the antimony you found in the body?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“Yes; the injudicious use of any antimonial medicine would\r\naccount for it.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Or even their judicious use?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“It might.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“With that knowledge, upon being consulted with regard\r\nto Cook, you gave it as your opinion that he died from the poison of\r\nantimony?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“You pervert my meaning entirely. I said that antimony in\r\nthe form of tartar emetic might occasion vomiting and other symptoms of\r\nirritation, and that in large doses it would cause death, preceded by\r\nconvulsions.” [The witness was proceeding to read his report upon the\r\ncase, but was stopped by the Court.] “I was told that the deceased was\r\nin good health seven or eight days before his death, and that he had\r\nbeen taken very sick and ill, and had died in convulsions. No further\r\nparticulars being given us, we were left to suppose that he had not\r\ndied a natural death. There was no natural cause to account for death;\r\nand finding antimony existing throughout the body, we thought it might\r\nhave been caused by antimony. An analysis cannot be made effectually\r\nwithout information.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“You think it necessary before you can rely upon an\r\nanalysis to have received a long statement of the symptoms before\r\ndeath?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“A short statement will do.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“You allow your judgment to be influenced by the statement\r\nof a person who knows nothing of his own knowledge?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“I do not allow my judgment to be influenced in any way; I\r\njudge by the result.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Do you mean to say that what Mr. Stevens told you did not\r\nassist you in arriving at the conclusion you state in writing?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“I stated it as a possible case—not as a certainty. If we\r\nhad found a large quantity of tartar emetic in the stomach we should\r\nhave come to the conclusion that the man died from it. As we found\r\nonly a small quantity, we said he might have died from it. I attended\r\nthe coroner’s inquest, first, I think, on December 14. Some of the\r\nevidence was read over to me. I think that Dr. Harland was the first\r\nwitness I heard examined. I heard Mr. Bamford, and also Lavinia Barnes.\r\nI cannot say as to Newton. I heard Jones. I had experimented some\r\nyears ago on five of the rabbits I have mentioned. That is the only\r\nknowledge of my own that I had of the effect of strychnia upon animal\r\nlife when I wrote my book. I have a great objection to the sacrifice of\r\nlife. No toxicologist will sacrifice the lives of one hundred rabbits\r\nto establish facts which he knows to be already well established. I\r\nexperimented on the last rabbits since the inquest.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Do you not think it rather rash to judge of the effects\r\nof strychnia on man by so small an experiment?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“You must add to the experiment the study of poisons and\r\ncases.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Do you not think that a rabbit is a very unfair animal to\r\nselect?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Would not a dog be better?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“They are very dangerous to handle.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Do you mean to give that answer?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“Dogs and cats bear a greater analogy to man because they\r\nvomit, while rabbits do not; but rabbits are much more manageable.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Do you admit that as to the action of the respiratory\r\norgans they would be better than rabbits?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“I do not.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“As to the effect of poison would they not?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“I think a rabbit quite as good as any animal. The poison is\r\nretained, and its operation is shown. At the inquest I saw Mr. Gardner\r\n(the solicitor of Mr. Stevens). I suggested questions to the coroner.\r\nSome of them he put to the witnesses, and others they answered upon my\r\nsuggesting them. Ten days before the inquest Mr. Gardner informed me\r\nin his letter that strychnia, Battley’s solution, and prussic acid,\r\nhad been purchased on Tuesday; that was why I used the expressions to\r\nwhich you have referred. We did not allow that information to have any\r\ninfluence on our report.” [The witness’s deposition before the coroner\r\nwas then read.] “Having given my evidence, I returned to town, and soon\r\nafterwards heard that the prisoner had been committed on a charge of\r\nwilful murder.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“And that his life depended in a great degree on you?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“No. I simply gave an opinion as to the poison, not as to\r\nthe prisoner’s case. I knew I should probably be examined as a witness\r\non the trial.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Do you think it your duty to abstain from all public\r\ndiscussion of the question which might influence the public mind.”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Did you write a letter to the _Lancet_?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“Yes, to contradict several mis-statements of my evidence\r\nthat had been made.”\r\n\r\n_Letter to_ Lancet _of Feb. 2, 1856, read, in which Dr. Taylor\r\nsaid_:—“During the quarter of a century which I have now specially\r\ndevoted to toxicological inquiries, I have never met with any cases\r\nlike these suspected cases of poisoning at Rugeley. The mode in which\r\nthey will affect the person accused is of minor importance compared\r\nwith their probable influence on society. I have no hesitation\r\nin saying that the future security of life in this country will\r\nmainly depend on the judge, the jury, and the counsel who may have\r\nto dispose of the charges of murder which have arisen out of these\r\ninvestigations.”[50]\r\n\r\n_Cross-examination continued._—“That is my opinion now. It had been\r\nstated that if strychnia caused death it could always be found, which\r\nI deny. It had also been circulated in every newspaper that a person\r\ncould not be killed by tartar emetic, which I deny, and which might\r\nhave led to the destruction of hundreds of lives. I entertained\r\nno prejudice against the prisoner. What I meant was that if these\r\nstatements which I had seen in medical and other periodicals were to\r\nhave their way there was not a life in the country which was safe.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Do you adhere to your opinion that ‘the mode in which\r\nthey will affect the person accused,’ that is, lead him to the\r\nscaffold, ‘is of minor importance, compared with their probable\r\ninfluence on society’?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“I have never suggested that they should lead him to the\r\nscaffold. I hope that, if innocent, he will be acquitted.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“What do you mean by the mode in which they will affect\r\nthe person accused being of minor importance?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“The lives of sixteen millions of people are, in my opinion,\r\nof greater importance than that of one man.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“That is your opinion?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“Yes. As you appear to put that as an objection to my\r\nevidence, allow me to state that in two dead bodies I find antimony.\r\nIn one case death occurred suddenly, and in the other the body was\r\nsaturated with antimony, which I never found before in the examination\r\nof three hundred bodies. I say these were circumstances which demanded\r\nexplanation.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“You adhere to the opinion that, as a medical man and a\r\nmember of an honourable profession, you were right in publishing this\r\nletter before the trial of the person accused?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“I think I had a right to state that opinion in answer to\r\nthe comments which had been made upon my evidence.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Had any comments been made by the prisoner?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n_Question._—“Or by any of his family?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—“Mr. Smith, the solicitor for the defence, circulated in\r\nevery paper statements of ‘Dr. Taylor’s inaccuracy.’ I had no wish or\r\nmotive to charge the prisoner with this crime. My duty concerns the\r\nlives of all.”\r\n\r\nI omit here the numerous questions about Mr. Mayhew’s visit, and\r\ntake up the _cross-examination_ with the witness’s opinion of Cook’s\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n “Cook’s symptoms were quite in accordance with an ordinary case of\r\n poisoning by strychnia.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Can you tell me any case in which a patient after being\r\n seized with tetanic symptoms sat up in bed and talked?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It was after he sat up that Cook was seized with these\r\n symptoms.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Can you refer to a case in which a patient who had taken\r\n strychnia beat the bed with his or her arms?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is exactly what I should expect to arise from a sense\r\n of suffocation.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you know in your reading of any case in which the\r\n symptoms of poisoning by strychnia commenced with beating of the bed\r\n clothes?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“There have been only about fifteen cases, and in none of\r\n those was the patient seized in bed. Beating of the bed clothes is a\r\n symptom which may be exhibited by a person suffering from a sense of\r\n suffocation, whether caused by strychnia or other causes. A case has\r\n been communicated to me by a friend, in which the patient shook as\r\n though with an ague.” [Answer objected to, but allowed as witness had\r\n been questioned as to the results of his reading.] “I have known of no\r\n case of poisoning by strychnia in which the patient screamed before\r\n he was seized. That is common in ordinary convulsions. In cases of\r\n poisoning by strychnia the patient screams when the spasms set in; the\r\n pain is very severe. I cannot refer to a case in which the patient\r\n has spoken freely after the paroxysms had commenced.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Can you refer me to any case in an authentic publication\r\n in which the access of the strychnia paroxysm has been delayed so long\r\n after the injection of the poison as in the case of Cook on Tuesday\r\n night?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes; longer. In my book on Medical Jurisprudence, p. 185,\r\n 5th Edition, it is stated that in a case communicated to the _Lancet_,\r\n Aug. 31, 1850, by Mr. Bennett, a grain and a half of strychnia taken\r\n by mistake destroyed the life of a healthy female in an hour and a\r\n half. None of the symptoms appeared for an hour. There is a case in\r\n which the period which elapsed was two hours and a half. A grain and\r\n a half is a full, but not a very considerable, dose. In my book on\r\n Poisons there is no case in which the paroxysm commenced more than an\r\n hour and a half after the injection of the poison. That book is eight\r\n years old, and since 1848 cases have occurred. There is a mention of\r\n one in which three hours elapsed before the paroxysms occurred.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Serjeant Shee_ then referred to the case, and called attention to\r\nthe fact that the only statement as to time was that in three hours the\r\npatient lost his speech, and was seized with violent convulsions.[51]\r\n\r\n _Cross-examination continued._—“I know of no other fatal case in\r\n which the interval was so long. In that case there was disease of\r\n the brain. Referring to the _Lancet_, I find that in the case to\r\n which I referred, as communicated by Dr. Bennett, the strychnia was\r\n dissolved in cinnamon water. Being dissolved, one would have expected\r\n it to have a more speedy action. The time in which a patient would\r\n recover would depend entirely upon the dose of strychnia which had\r\n been taken. I do not remember any case in which a patient recovered\r\n in three or four hours, but such cases must have occurred. There is\r\n one mentioned in my book on Medical Jurisprudence. The patient had\r\n taken nux vomica, but its powers depend upon strychnia. In that case\r\n the violence of the paroxysms gradually subsided, and the next day,\r\n although feeble and exhausted, the patient was able to walk home.\r\n The time of the recovery is a point which is not usually stated by\r\n medical men. I cannot mention any case in which there was a repetition\r\n of the paroxysms after so long an interval as that from Monday to\r\n Tuesday night, which occurred in Cook’s case. I do not think that the\r\n attack on Tuesday night was the result of anything which had been\r\n administered to him on the Monday night. In the cases of four out of\r\n five rabbits the rigidity was continued at the time of death and after\r\n death. In the other the animal was flaccid at the time of death.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Are you acquainted with this opinion of Dr. Christison,\r\n that in these cases rigidity does not come on at the time of death,\r\n but comes on shortly afterwards?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Dr. Christison speaks from his experience, and I from\r\n mine.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Did you hear that Dr. Bamford said that when he arrived\r\n he found the body of Cook quite straight in bed?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Can that have been a case of ophisthotonos?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It may have been.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Are not the colour tests of strychnia so uncertain and\r\n fallacious that they cannot be depended upon?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, unless you first get the strychnia in a visible and\r\n tangible form.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is it not impossible to get it so from the stomach?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is not impossible; it depends upon the quantity which\r\n remains there.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You do not agree that the fiftieth part of a grain might\r\n be discovered?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I think not.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Nor even half a grain?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“That might be. It would depend upon the quantity of food\r\n in the stomach with which it was mixed.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by the Attorney-General._—“In cases of death from\r\n strychnia the heart is sometimes found empty after death. That is\r\n the case of human subjects. There are three such cases on record. I\r\n think that emptiness results from spasmodic affection of the heart.\r\n I know of no reason why that should rather occur in the case of man\r\n than in that of a small animal like a rabbit. The heart is generally\r\n more filled when the paroxysms are frequent. When the paroxysm is\r\n short and violent, and causes death in a few moments, I should expect\r\n to find the heart empty. The rigidity after death always affects\r\n the same muscles; those of the limbs and back. In the case of the\r\n rabbit, in which the rigidity was relaxed at the time of death, it\r\n returned while the body was warm. In ordinary death it only occurs\r\n when the body is cold, or nearly so. I never knew a case of tetanus\r\n in which the rigidity lasted two months after death; but such a fact\r\n would give me the impression that there were very violent spasms. It\r\n would indicate great violence of the spasms from which the person\r\n died. The time which elapses between the taking of strychnia and the\r\n commencement of the paroxysms depends on the constitution and strength\r\n of the individual. A feeling of suffocation is one of the earliest\r\n symptoms of poisoning by strychnia, and that would lead the patient\r\n to beat the bedclothes. I have no doubt that the substances I used\r\n for the purpose of analysis were pure. I had tested them. The fact\r\n that three distinct processes each gave the same result was strong\r\n confirmation of each. I have no doubt that what we found was antimony.\r\n The quantity found does not enable me to say how much was taken. It\r\n might be the residue of either large or small doses. Sickness would\r\n throw off some portion of the antimony which had been administered. We\r\n did not analyse the bones and tissues. I suggested questions to the\r\n coroner because he did not put such as enabled me to form an opinion.\r\n I think that arose rather from want of knowledge than intention. There\r\n was an omission to take down the answers. At the time I wrote to Mr.\r\n Gardiner I had not learnt the symptoms which attended the attack and\r\n death of Cook. I had only the information that he was well seven days\r\n before he died, and had died in convulsions. I had not information to\r\n lead me to suppose that strychnia had been the cause of death, except\r\n that Palmer had purchased strychnia. Failing to find opium, prussic\r\n acid, or strychnia, I referred to antimony as the only substance found\r\n in the body. Before writing to the _Lancet_, I had been made the\r\n subject of a great many attacks. What I had said as to the possibility\r\n or impossibility of discovering strychnia after death had been\r\n misrepresented. In various newspapers it had been represented that I\r\n had said strychnia could never be detected—that it was destroyed by\r\n putrefaction. What I had said was, that when absorbed in the blood\r\n it could not be separated as strychnia. I wrote the letter in my own\r\n vindication.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Rees_ and _Professor Brande_ briefly but decidedly confirmed the\r\nstatements, and coincided with the opinions expressed by Dr. Taylor,\r\nthe latter witness speaking as to an experiment made by him to test the\r\naccuracy of the previous one, with reference to the supposed presence\r\nof antimony, which enabled him to state positively that that poison was\r\nisolated by it. _Professor Christison_, of the University of Edinburgh,\r\nauthor of the well-known treatise on poisons, was then called, and gave\r\nthe following evidence:—\r\n\r\n _Professor Christison_ said:—“I am a fellow of the Royal College\r\n of Physicians and Professor of Materia Medica to the University of\r\n Edinburgh; I am also the author of a work on the subject of poisons,\r\n and I have directed a good deal of attention to strychnia. In my\r\n opinion it acts by absorption into the blood, and through that upon\r\n the nervous system. I have seen its effects upon a human subject,\r\n but not a fatal case. I have seen it tried upon pigs, rabbits,\r\n cats, and one wild boar. (A laugh.) I first directed my attention\r\n to this poison in 1820, in Paris. It had been discovered two years\r\n before in Paris. In most of my experiments upon animals I gave very\r\n small doses—a sixth of a grain; but I once administered a grain. I\r\n cannot say how small a dose would cause the death of an animal by\r\n administration into the stomach. I generally applied it by injection\r\n through an incision in the cavity of the chest. A sixth part of a\r\n grain so administered killed a dog in two minutes. I once administered\r\n to a rabbit, through the stomach, a dose of a grain. I saw Dr. Taylor\r\n administer three-quarters of a grain to a rabbit, and it was all\r\n swallowed except a very small quantity. The symptoms are nearly the\r\n same in rabbits, cats, and dogs. The first is a slight tremor and\r\n unwillingness to move; then frequently the animal jerks its head\r\n back slightly; soon after that all the symptoms of tetanus come on\r\n which have been so often described by the previous witnesses. When\r\n the poison is administered by the stomach death generally takes place\r\n between a period of five minutes and five and twenty minutes after\r\n the symptoms first make their appearance. I have frequently opened\r\n the bodies of animals thus killed, and have never been able to trace\r\n any effect of the poison upon the stomach or intestines, or upon the\r\n spinal cord or brain, that I could attribute satisfactorily to the\r\n poison. The heart of the animal generally contained blood in all the\r\n cases in which I have been concerned. In the case of the wild boar the\r\n poison was injected into the chest. A third of a grain was all that\r\n was used, and in ten minutes the symptoms began to show themselves.\r\n If strychnia was administered in the form of a pill it might be\r\n mixed with other ingredients that would protract the period of its\r\n operation. This would be the case if it were mixed with resinous\r\n materials, or any materials that were difficult of digestion, and\r\n such materials would be within the knowledge of any medical men, and\r\n they are frequently used for the purpose of making ordinary pills.\r\n Absorption in such a case would not commence until the pill was\r\n broken down by the process of digestion. In the present state of our\r\n knowledge of the subject I do not think it is possible to fix the\r\n precise time when the operation of the poison commences on a human\r\n subject. In the case of an animal we take care that it is fasting,\r\n and we mix the poison with ingredients that are readily soluble, and\r\n in every circumstance favourable for the development of the poison.\r\n I have seen many cases of tetanus arising from wounds and other\r\n causes. The general symptoms of the disorder very nearly resemble each\r\n other, and in all the natural forms of tetanus the symptoms begin\r\n and advance much more slowly, and they prove fatal much more slowly,\r\n and there is no intermission in certain forms of natural tetanus. In\r\n tetanus from strychnia there are short intermissions. I have heard\r\n the evidence of what took place at the ‘Talbot Arms’ on the Monday\r\n and Tuesday, and the result of my experience induces me to come to\r\n the conclusion that the symptoms exhibited by the deceased were only\r\n attributable to strychnia, or the four poisons containing it: namely,\r\n nux vomica, St. Ignatius’s bean, snakewood, and a draught poison\r\n called “exhetwick.”[52] There is no natural disease of any description\r\n that I am acquainted with to which I could refer these symptoms. In\r\n cases of tetanus consciousness remains to the very last moment. When\r\n death takes place in a human subject by spasm it tends to empty the\r\n heart of blood. When death is the consequence of the administration of\r\n strychnia, if the quantity is small, I should not expect to find any\r\n trace in the body after death. If there was an excess of quantity more\r\n than was required to cause the death by absorption, I should expect to\r\n find that excess in the stomach. The colour tests for the detection of\r\n the presence of strychnia are uncertain. Vegetable poisons are more\r\n difficult of detection than mineral ones, and there is one poison with\r\n which I am acquainted for which no known test has been discovered.\r\n The stomach of the deceased was sent in a very unsatisfactory state\r\n for examination, and there must have been a considerable quantity\r\n of strychnia in the stomach to have enabled any one to detect its\r\n presence under such circumstances.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Grove._—“The experiments I refer to were made\r\n many years ago. In one instance I tried one of the colour tests in\r\n the case of a man who was poisoned by strychnia, but I failed to\r\n discover the presence of the poison in the stomach. I tried the test\r\n for the development of the violet colour by means of sulphuric acid\r\n and oxide of lead. From my own observation I should say that animals\r\n destroyed by strychnia die of asphyxia, but in my work, which has been\r\n referred to, it will be seen that I have left the question open.”\r\n\r\nSome further questions were put to the witness by the learned counsel\r\nfor the prisoner in reference to opinions expressed by him in his work,\r\nand he explained that this work was written twelve years ago, and that\r\nthe experience he had since obtained had modified some of the opinions\r\nhe then entertained.\r\n\r\n _Cross-examination continued._—“I have not noticed that in cases\r\n where a patient is suffering from strychnia the slightest touch\r\n appears to bring on the paroxysm. It is very remarkable in the case\r\n of animals, unless you touch them very gently indeed. Strychnia has a\r\n most intensely bitter taste. It is said on the authority of a French\r\n chemist that a grain will give a taste to more than a gallon of water.\r\n If resinous substances were used in the formation of a pill it does\r\n not follow that they would necessarily be found in the stomach; they\r\n might be passed off.”\r\n\r\n _By the Attorney-General._—“One of the cases quoted in the work that\r\n has been referred to was that of a gamekeeper, who was found dead;\r\n his head was thrown back, his hands were clenched, and his limbs were\r\n rigid. A paper containing strychnia was found in his pocket, and upon\r\n a _post-mortem_ examination, there were indications which, under the\r\n circumstances, satisfied me of the existence of strychnia. There was a\r\n substance in the body of an intensely bitter taste, which was tested\r\n by the colour test, and it succeeded in one instance, but failed in\r\n another. It appears that colour tests are not to be relied upon in\r\n the case of strychnia in an impure condition: in the first place, you\r\n may not find indication of strychnia: and, secondly, they are subject\r\n to fallacy even if the strychnia is pure from other substances not\r\n containing strychnia presenting similar appearances.”\r\n\r\nWith the _examination_ of this witness, the medical and scientific\r\nevidence for the prosecution was closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICO-SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nThe conflict in the testimony given by scientific experts in this\r\ncase, will be more clearly shown if, instead of deferring it to its\r\noriginal position, after the speech for the defence, the evidence of\r\nthe eminent medical men and analysts is at once contrasted with that\r\nof those called for the prosecution. The two points mainly in contest\r\nwere, (1.) Were the symptoms in Cook’s case such as could only be\r\nproduced by _strychnia_, or could they have arisen from other diseases,\r\nand especially from one of the forms of ordinary _tetanus_? (2.) If\r\nstrychnia had been given, could it not have been discovered by chemical\r\nanalysis?[53] Under the _first_ head came the consideration of Cook’s\r\nmode of life and general state of health, and his excitement at the\r\nvictory of his horse at such a critical period of his fortunes, as\r\npredisposing causes to one or other of the various diseases to which\r\nthe witnesses for the defence were prepared to attribute the symptoms\r\nand the result. Under the _second_, the success that uniformly attended\r\nsuch analysts as Mr. Herapath in detecting, even twenty times less than\r\nthe fiftieth part of a grain of strychnia, and the inference that as\r\nit was not discovered by such eminent analysts as Dr. Taylor and Dr.\r\nRees, that none had been given. If this inference was fair, it would\r\nfollow that, however mysterious the causes of the death of Cook might\r\nhave been, and the symptoms of his attacks difficult of being referred\r\nto any known form of disease, yet it was not proved that he died of\r\nstrychnia, and that therefore Palmer was entitled to an acquittal.\r\n“According to the witnesses for the Crown,” said Serjeant Shee, “the\r\npoison of strychnia is of that nature, that when it has done its fatal\r\nwork, and become absorbed into the system, it ceases to be the thing\r\nit was when it was taken into the system; it becomes decomposed, its\r\nelements separated from each other, and, therefore, no longer capable\r\nof responding to the tests which, according to Taylor, would certainly\r\ndetect the presence of undecomposed strychnia. They account for the\r\nfact that it is not detected, and for their still believing that it\r\ndestroyed Mr. Cook, by this hypothesis. Now it is only an hypothesis:\r\nthere is no foundation for it in experiment: it is not supported by the\r\nevidence of any eminent toxicologists but themselves; it was the theory\r\nof Dr. Taylor, which he propounds in his book—but he propounds it as\r\na theory of his own; he does not vouch, as I remember, any eminent\r\ntoxicologist in support of it.”\r\n\r\nAgainst this theory, among other eminent men, the defence called _Mr.\r\nNunneley_, of Leeds, who had assisted Mr. Morley (previously called for\r\nthe prosecution) in the case of Mrs. Dove, _Dr. Letheby_, the medical\r\nofficer of health of the city of London, and _Mr. William Herapath_.\r\nOf these three experts it will be advisable to give the evidence at\r\nsome length, contenting oneself with summarising that of the other\r\nscientific witnesses who agreed with them in rejecting, as a scientific\r\nheresy, the hypothesis of Dr. Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of _Mr. Nunneley_ covered both points—the character of\r\nCook’s symptoms and the discovery of strychnia. “He had been, he said,\r\nin large practice for more than twenty-five years, and had seen four\r\ncases of _idiopathic tetanus_, all of which did not commence with\r\nlockjaw; in one of them lockjaw not becoming so marked as to prevent\r\nthe person from swallowing once during the disease.”\r\n\r\n “I assume,” said the witness, “that Cook was a man of very delicate\r\n constitution; that for a long time he had felt himself ailing, for\r\n which indisposition he had been under medical treatment; that he had\r\n suffered from syphilis; that he had disease of the lungs, and an old\r\n standing disease of the throat; that he led an irregular life; that\r\n he was subject to mental depression and excitement, and that after\r\n death appearances were found in his body to show this to have been\r\n the case. There was an unusual appearance in the stomach. The throat\r\n was in an unnatural condition. The back of the tongue showed similar\r\n indications. The air vessels of the lungs were dilated. In the lining\r\n of the aorta there was an unnatural deposit, and there was an unusual\r\n appearance in the membranes of the spinal marrow. One of the witnesses\r\n also said there was a loss of substance from the penis. That scar on\r\n it could only have resulted from an ulcer. A chancre is an ulcer, but\r\n an ulcer is not necessarily a chancre. The symptoms at the root of the\r\n tongue and throat I should ascribe to syphilitic inflammation of the\r\n throat. _Supposing these symptoms to be correct_” (_which they were\r\n not_), “I should infer that Cook’s health had not for a long time been\r\n good, and that his constitution was delicate. His father and mother\r\n died young. _Supposing that to have been his state of health_, it\r\n would make him liable to nervous irritation. That might be excited by\r\n moral causes. Any excitement or depression might produce that effect.\r\n A person of _such_ health and constitution would be more susceptible\r\n of the injurious influence of wet and cold than one of a stronger\r\n one. Upon _such a constitution_ convulsive disease is more likely to\r\n supervene. I understand he had three attacks on succeeding nights,\r\n occurring about the same hour. As a medical man I should infer from\r\n this that they were of a convulsive character—_in the absence of\r\n other causes to account for_ them. Convulsive attacks are as various\r\n as possible in their forms and degrees of violence: it is not possible\r\n to give a definite name to every convulsive symptom. There are some\r\n forms of convulsion in which the patient retains consciousness. Those\r\n are forms of hysteria, sometimes found in the male sex. It is also\r\n stated that there are forms of epilepsy in which the patient retains\r\n consciousness.”\r\n\r\n _To Lord Campbell._—“_I cannot mention a case in which consciousness\r\n has been retained during the fit. No such case has come under my\r\n notice._”\r\n\r\n _Examination continued._—“I know from reading that, though rarely,\r\n it does sometimes occur. The degree of consciousness in epilepsy\r\n varies very much. In some attacks it is wholly lost for a long time.\r\n Convulsive attacks are sometimes accompanied by violent spasms and\r\n rigidity of the limbs—they sometimes assume tetanic complexion.\r\n I agree with Dr. Copland that convulsions arise from almost any\r\n cause. Affections of the spinal cord, or eating indigestible food,\r\n will produce them. I know of no case in which they resulted from\r\n retching and vomiting. I agree with Dr. Copland that they sometimes\r\n end immediately in death. The immediate proximate cause of death is\r\n frequently asphyxia. Death from spasm of the heart is often described\r\n as death by asphyxia. I have seen convulsions recurring—in various\r\n cases. The time at which a patient recovers his ease after a violent\r\n attack of convulsions varies very much. It may be a few minutes, it\r\n may be hours. From an interval between one convulsion and another I\r\n should infer that the convulsions arose from slight irritation in the\r\n brain or the spinal cord. When death takes place in such paroxysms\r\n there is sometimes no trace of organic disease to be found by a\r\n _post-mortem_ examination. _Granules between the_ DURA MATER _and\r\n the_ ARACHNOID _are not common at any age. I should not draw any\r\n particular inference from their appearance. They might or might not\r\n lead to a conjecture as to their cause and effect. I do not form any\r\n opinion upon these points._ They might produce an effect upon the\r\n spinal cord. There are three preparations in museums where granules\r\n are exhibited in the spinal cord, in which the patients are said to\r\n have died from tetanus. Those are at St. Thomas’s Hospital.[54] To\r\n ascertain the nature and effect of such granules the spinal cord ought\r\n to be examined immediately after death. Not the most remote opinion\r\n could be formed upon an examination made two months after death, more\r\n especially if the brain had been previously opened. Independently of\r\n the appearance of granules, it would not after that period be possible\r\n to form a satisfactory opinion upon the general condition of the\r\n spinal cord. If there were a large tumour, or some similar change,\r\n it might be exhibited; but neither softening nor induration of the\r\n structure could be perceived. The nervous structure changes within two\r\n days of death. To ascertain minutely its condition it is necessary\r\n to use a lens or microscope. That is required in an examination made\r\n immediately after death. I have attended cases of _traumatic tetanus_.\r\n That disease commonly begins with an attack upon the jaw. One of the\r\n cases of _idiopathic tetanus_ that I have seen was my own child. In\r\n three of those cases the disease began with lockjaw. The fourth case\r\n commenced in the body, the facility of swallowing remaining. I have\r\n within the last twelve months made _post-mortem_ examinations of two\r\n persons who had died from strychnia. I did not see the patients before\r\n death. In both cases I ascertained by chemical analysis that death\r\n had been caused by strychnia. In both I found the strychnia. In one\r\n case—that of a lady aged twenty-eight years—I made my examination\r\n forty-two hours after death, and in the other thirty hours. In the\r\n former case the body had not been opened before I commenced my\r\n examination.” [The witness read a report of this examination, in\r\n which it was stated that the eyelids were partially open, the globes\r\n flaccid, and the pupils dilated. The muscles of the trunk were not in\r\n the least rigid; indeed, they were so soft that the body might be bent\r\n in any direction. The muscles at the hip and shoulder joints were not\r\n quite so flaccid, but they allowed these joints to be easily moved;\r\n while those of the head and neck, forearms, &c., were rigid. The\r\n fingers were curved, and the feet somewhat arched. All the muscles,\r\n when cut into, were found soft and dark in colour. The membranes\r\n of the liver were exceedingly vascular. The membrane of the spinal\r\n cord was much congested. There was bloody serum in the pericardium;\r\n the lungs were distended, and some of the air cells were ruptured.\r\n The lining membrane of the trachea and bronchial tubes was covered\r\n with a layer of dark bloody mucus of a dark chocolate colour. The\r\n thoracic vessels and membranes were much congested, and the blood was\r\n everywhere dark and fluid.] After reading this report the witness\r\n continued:—“In the second case I made my examination thirty hours\r\n after death. I first saw the body about twelve hours after death. It\r\n was a woman somewhere near twenty years of age.” [The witness also\r\n read the report of the examination in this case. The appearances\r\n of the body were substantially similar to those presented in the\r\n previous case.] “In two other cases I have seen a patient suffering\r\n from over doses of strychnia. Neither of those cases was fatal. In\r\n one case I had prescribed the twelfth of a grain, and the patient\r\n took one-sixth. That was for a man of middle age. Strychnia had been\r\n given in solution. In a few minutes the symptoms appeared. They were\r\n a want of power to control the muscles, manifested by twitchings,\r\n rigidity, and cramp, more violent in the legs than in any other part\r\n of the body. The spasms were not very violent. They continued six\r\n hours before they entirely disappeared. During that time they were\r\n intermittent at various intervals. As the attack passed off the\r\n length of the intervals increased. At first their length was but a\r\n few seconds. The spasms were not combated by medical treatment.\r\n The other case was a very similar one. The quantity taken was the\r\n same—double what I had prescribed. I have experimented upon upwards\r\n of sixty animals with strychnia. Those animals were dogs, cats, rats,\r\n mice, guinea pigs, frogs, and toads. The symptoms of the attack in\r\n all animals present great resemblances. Some animals are, however,\r\n much more susceptible of its influence than others are. The period\r\n elapsing between the injection of the poison and the commencement of\r\n the symptoms has been from two minutes to thirty,—more generally five\r\n or six. I administered the poison occasionally in solution, but more\r\n generally in its solid state. It was sometimes placed dry upon the\r\n back of the tongue, and some fluid poured down the throat; sometimes\r\n it was enclosed between two portions of meat; sometimes mixed up with\r\n butter or suet, and sometimes rolled up in a small piece of gut. To\r\n frogs and toads it was administered by putting them into a solution of\r\n strychnia. I have also applied it direct to the spinal cord, and in\r\n other cases to the brain. The first symptom has been a desire to be\r\n quite still; then hurried breathing; then slavering at the mouth (when\r\n the poison had been given through that organ); then twitching of the\r\n ears, trembling of the muscles, inability to walk, convulsions of all\r\n the muscles of the body, the jaws being generally firmly closed; the\r\n convulsions attended by a total want of power in the muscles, which on\r\n the least touch were thrown into violent spasms with a galvanic-like\r\n shock. Spasms also come on if the animal voluntarily attempts to move;\r\n that is usually the case, but occasionally the animal is able to move\r\n without inducing a recurrence of the spasms. These spasms recur at\r\n various periods, but do not always increase in violence. The animals\r\n die after periods varying from three hours to three hours and a half.\r\n In the cases where the animals live longest, the paroxysms occur at\r\n the longest intervals. In all cases in the interval before death\r\n the rigidity ceases (I know no exception to this) and the muscles\r\n become quite soft, powerless, and flaccid. The limbs may be put in\r\n any position whatever. There is but little difference from ordinary\r\n cases of convulsive death in the time at which the _rigor mortis_\r\n comes on. I have destroyed animals with other poisons, and there is\r\n very little difference between the rigidity in their cases and that in\r\n the cases of death from strychnia. In the two women I have mentioned\r\n the _rigor mortis_ was much less than is usual in cases of death\r\n from natural disease. I have known fatal cases of poisoning animals\r\n by strychnia in which there has between the first and the second\r\n paroxysm been an interval of about half-an-hour, but that is not\r\n common. I have examined the bodies of upwards of forty animals killed\r\n by strychnia. I have invariably found the heart full on the right\r\n side; very generally the left ventricle firmly contracted, and the\r\n blood usually dark, and often fluid. There is no particular appearance\r\n about the spine. I have experimented with other poisons upon upwards\r\n of 3000 animals, and have written upon this subject. It very often\r\n happens that in the case of animals dying suddenly from poisoning the\r\n blood is fluid after death. That also happens in cases of sudden death\r\n from other causes. I have attended to the evidence as to the symptoms\r\n exhibited by Cook on the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights. The\r\n symptoms on Sunday night I assume to have been from great excitement.\r\n Cook described himself as having been very ill, and in such a state\r\n that he considered himself mad for a few minutes. He stated that\r\n the cause of this was a noise in the street. These symptoms in the\r\n three nights I have mentioned, do not resemble those which I have\r\n seen follow the administration of strychnia. Cook had more power of\r\n voluntary motion than I have observed in animals under the influence\r\n of this poison. He sat up in bed, and moved his hands about freely,\r\n swallowed, talked, and asked to be rubbed and moved, none of which,\r\n if poisoned by strychnia, could he have done. The sudden accession\r\n of the convulsions is another reason for believing that they were\r\n not produced by strychnia. Other reasons for believing that the\r\n convulsions were not produced by strychnia are their sudden accession\r\n without the usual premonitory symptoms, the length of time which had\r\n elapsed between their commencement and the taking of the pills which\r\n are supposed to have contained poison, and the screaming and vomiting.\r\n I never knew an animal which had been poisoned with strychnia to vomit\r\n or scream voluntarily. I apprehend that where there is so much spasm\r\n of the heart there must be inability to vomit. In the cases related\r\n in which attempts were made to produce vomiting they did not succeed.\r\n There is such a case in the 10th volume of the _Journal de Pharmacie_,\r\n in which an emetic was given without success. The symptoms exhibited\r\n after death by animals poisoned by strychnia differ materially from\r\n those presented by the body of Cook. In his case the heart is stated\r\n to have been empty and uncontracted.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Campbell._—“I do not remember that. I think it was said that it\r\n was contracted.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Baron Alderson._-”According to my note, Dr. Harland said that the\r\n heart was contracted, and contained no blood.”\r\n\r\n _Examination continued._—“The lungs were not congested, nor was the\r\n brain. In the case of animals which have recovered the paroxysms have\r\n subsided gradually. I never knew a severe paroxysm followed by a\r\n long interval of repose. I have experimented upon the discovery of\r\n strychnia in the bodies of animals in various stages of decomposition,\r\n from a few hours after death up to the forty-third day, in which\r\n latter case the body was quite putrid. It has never happened to me\r\n to fail to discover the poison. I have experimented in about fifteen\r\n cases.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Supposing a person to have died under the influence\r\n of strychnia poison in the first paroxysm, and his stomach to have\r\n been taken out and put into a jar on the sixth day after death, must\r\n strychnia have, by a proper analysis, been found in the body?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes. If the strychnia be pure, such as is almost\r\n invariably found among medical men and druggists, the test is nitric\r\n acid, which gives a red colour, which in a great measure disappears on\r\n the addition of protochloride of tin.[55] If the strychnia be pure, it\r\n does not undergo any change on the addition of sulphuric acid, but on\r\n the addition of a mixture of bichromate of potash, with several other\r\n substances it produces a beautiful purple, which changes to varying\r\n shades until it gets to be a dirty red. There are several other tests.\r\n In this case the stomach was not, in my opinion, in an unfavourable\r\n condition for examination. The circumstances attending its position in\r\n the jar and its removal to London would give a little more trouble,\r\n but would not otherwise affect the result. If the deceased had died\r\n from strychnia poison it ought to have been found in the liver,\r\n spleen, and kidneys. I have seen this poison found in similar portions\r\n of animals which had been killed by it. I have also seen it found in\r\n the blood; that was by Mr. Herapath, of Bristol.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Could the analyses be defeated or confused by the\r\n existence in the stomach of any other substance which would produce\r\n the same colours?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No. Supposing that pyroxanthine and salicine were in\r\n the parts examined, their existence would not defeat the analysis.\r\n Pyroxanthine is very unlikely to be found in the stomach. It is one\r\n of the rarest and most difficult to be obtained. The distinction\r\n between pyroxanthine and strychnia is quite evident. Pyroxanthine\r\n changes to a deep purple on the addition of sulphuric acid alone, and\r\n the bichromate of potash spoils the colour. In strychnia no change is\r\n produced by sulphuric acid. It requires the addition of the bichromate\r\n to produce the colour.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Supposing the death to have been caused by a dose of\r\n strychnia, not more than sufficient to destroy the animal, would it\r\n be so diffused by the process of absorption that you would not be able\r\n by these tests to detect it in any portion of the system?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; I believe it would not. That question had occupied my\r\n attention before I was called upon to give evidence in this trial. My\r\n reason for stating that strychnia when it has done its work continues\r\n as strychnia in the system is, that those who say some change takes\r\n place, argue, that as food undergoes a change, so does poison; it\r\n becomes decomposed. But the change in food takes place in digestion;\r\n consequently its traces are not found in the blood. Substances\r\n like strychnia are absorbed without digestion, and may be obtained\r\n unchanged from the blood. They may be administered in various ways.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“In your judgment, will any amount of putrefaction\r\n prevent the discovery of strychnia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“To say that it is absolutely indestructible would be\r\n absurd, but within ordinary limits, no. I have found it at the end\r\n of forty days. The emptier the stomach, the quicker the action of\r\n strychnia.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_ by the _Attorney-General_, the witness, who,\r\nto judge from the expressions that passed between them, assumed an\r\nantagonistic position to the prosecution, after admitting that perhaps\r\nhalf of his sixty experiments had been made in conjunction with Mr.\r\nMorley, and spread over thirty years; that some had been made after the\r\nLeeds case, and some in reference to the present, and that he had been\r\nin consultation with the prisoner’s attorney since the case at Leeds,\r\nto whom he had transmitted its details, he thus continued:—\r\n\r\n “The general dose in these experiments was from half a grain to\r\n two grains; half a grain is sufficient to destroy life in larger\r\n animals. I have seen both a dog and a cat die of this dose, but not\r\n always. Some animals as a species are more susceptible than those of\r\n a different species, and among animals of the same species some are\r\n more susceptible than others. The symptoms in the experiments I have\r\n mentioned did not occur after so long a period as an hour. We have had\r\n to repeat the dose in some instances when half a grain was given. In\r\n the case of a cat, symptoms of spasm were produced, but the cat did\r\n not die; she had not swallowed the whole dose. I think I have known\r\n animals of the cat species killed with half a grain.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you any doubt of it?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes. I think it would be the minimum dose in an old\r\n strong cat. If given in a fluid state I think a smaller dose\r\n would suffice. Hurried breathing is one of the first symptoms,\r\n afterwards there are twitchings and trembling of the muscles and then\r\n convulsions.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is there any diversity in the intervals and order of the\r\n symptoms in animals of the same species?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“They certainly do not occur after the same intervals\r\n of time, but I should say they generally occur in the order I have\r\n described. There is some difference in the periods at which the\r\n convulsions take place. Some will die after less convulsions than\r\n others, but generally after four or five. In one or two instances an\r\n animal has died after one convulsion. In those instances a dose has\r\n been given equal in amount to another which has not produced the same\r\n effect. The order in which the muscles are convulsed varies to some\r\n extent. The muscles of the limbs are generally affected first. The\r\n convulsions generally occur simultaneously.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you know of any case of strychnia in which rigidity\r\n after death was greater than the usual _rigor mortis_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I think not. I don’t think there is any peculiar rigidity\r\n produced by strychnia.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you never found undue rigidity in a human subject\r\n after death by strychnia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Considerably less.”\r\n\r\n _Question._-”In the anonymous case (the Leeds), were not the hands\r\n curved and the feet arched by muscular contraction?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Not more than is usual in cases of death from ordinary\r\n causes. The limbs were rigid, but not more than usual.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“In the face of the medical profession I ask you whether\r\n you signed a report stating that ‘the hands were curved and the feet\r\n decidedly arched by muscular contraction,’ and whether you meant by\r\n those words that there was no more than the ordinary rigidity of\r\n death?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Certainly; I stated so at the time.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Where? In the report?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; in conversation. Allow me to explain that a\r\n distinction was drawn between the muscles of the different parts of\r\n the body. I heard Mr. Morley’s evidence with regard to experiments on\r\n animals, and his statement that ‘after death there was an interval of\r\n flaccidity, after which rigidity commenced more than if it had been\r\n occasioned by the usual _rigor mortis_.’”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You don’t agree with that statement?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I do not. I generally found the right side of the heart\r\n full.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Does the fact of the heart in Cook’s case having been\r\n found empty lead you to the conclusion that death was not caused by\r\n strychnia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Among other things, it does. I heard the evidence of Dr.\r\n Watson as to the case of Agnes Sennett, in which the heart was found\r\n distended and empty: also of Dr. Taylor, as to the _post-mortem_ of\r\n Mrs. Smyth. No doubt he stated that the heart in that case was also\r\n empty.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“And do those facts exercise no influence on your\r\n judgment?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“They would not unless I knew how the _post-mortem_\r\n examination had been made. If it was commenced at the head, the blood\r\n being fluid, the large drains would be opened, and the blood, from\r\n natural causes, would drain away.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you know how the _post-mortem_ examination was made\r\n in this case?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No. Excuse me, I do. The chest and the abdomen, not the\r\n head, were first opened.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“The heart, then, was not emptied in the first instance?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Then what occasioned the contraction of the heart?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“When the heart is emptied it is usually contracted.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“But how do you account for its contraction and\r\n emptiness?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I cannot account for it.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Campbell._—“ Would the heart contract if there was blood in it?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Campbell._—“When you find the heart contracted, you know, then,\r\n that it was contracted at the moment of death?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is necessary to draw a distinction between the two\r\n cavities. It is very common to find the left ventricle contracted and\r\n hard, while the right is uncontracted.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Campbell._—“That is death by asphyxia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Precisely.”[56]\r\n\r\n _By the Attorney-General._—“In Cook’s case the lungs were described\r\n as not congested. Entosthema is of two kinds; one of them consists\r\n of dilation of the cells, the other of a rupture of the cells. When\r\n animals die from strychnine, entosthema occurs. I do not know the\r\n character of the entosthema in Cook’s case. It did not occur to me to\r\n have the question put to the witnesses who described the _post-mortem_\r\n examination.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“To what constitutional symptoms about Cook do you\r\n ascribe the convulsions from which he died?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Not to any.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Was not the fact of his having syphilis an important\r\n ingredient in your judgment upon his case?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It was. I judge that he died from convulsions, by the\r\n combination of symptoms.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What evidence have you to suppose that he was liable to\r\n excitement and depression of spirits?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“The fact that after winning the race he could not speak\r\n for three minutes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Anything else?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Mr. Jones stated that he was subject to mental depression.\r\n Excitement will produce a state of brain which will be followed, at\r\n some distance, by convulsions. I think Dr. Bamford made a mistake when\r\n he said the brain was perfectly healthy.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you mean to set up that opinion against that of Dr.\r\n Devonshire and Dr. Harland, who were present at the _post-mortem_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“My opinion is founded in part on the evidence taken at the\r\n inquest, in part on the depositions. With the brain and the system in\r\n the condition in which Cook’s were, I believe it is quite possible\r\n for convulsions to come on and destroy a person. I do not believe\r\n that he died from apoplexy. He was under the influence of morphia. I\r\n don’t ascribe his death to morphia, except that it might assist in\r\n producing a convulsive attack. I should think morphia was not very\r\n good treatment, considering the state of excitement he was in.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you mean to say, on your oath, that you think he was\r\n in a state of excitement at Rugeley?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I wish to give my evidence honestly. Morphia, when given\r\n in an injured state of the brain, often disagrees with the patient.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“But what evidence have you as to the injured state of\r\n the brain?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Sickness often indicates it. I can’t say whether the\r\n attack of Sunday night was an attack of convulsions. I think that\r\n the Sunday attack was one of a similar character, but not so intense,\r\n as the attack of Tuesday, in which he died. I don’t think he had\r\n convulsions on the Sunday, but he was in that condition which often\r\n precedes convulsions. I think he was mistaken when he stated that\r\n he was awoke by a noise. I believe he was delirious. That is one of\r\n the symptoms on which I found my opinion. Any intestinal irritation\r\n will produce convulsions in a tetanic form. I have known instances in\r\n children. I have not seen an instance in an animal. Medical writers\r\n state that such cases do occur. I know no name for convulsions of that\r\n kind.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you ever known a case of convulsions of that kind,\r\n terminating in death, in which the patient remained conscious to the\r\n last?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I have not. Where epilepsy terminates in death\r\n consciousness is gone. I have known four cases of _traumatic_, and\r\n five or six of _idiopathic tetanus_.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You heard Mr. Jones make this statement of the symptoms\r\n of Cook after the commencement of the paroxysms:—‘After he swallowed\r\n the pills he uttered loud screams, threw himself back in the bed,\r\n and was dreadfully convulsed. He said, “Raise me up! I shall be\r\n suffocated.” The convulsions affected every muscle of the body, and\r\n were accompanied by stiffening of the limbs. I endeavoured to raise\r\n Cook with the assistance of Palmer, but found it quite impossible\r\n owing to the rigidity of the limbs. When Cook found we could not raise\r\n him up, he asked me to turn him over. He was then quite sensible. I\r\n turned him on to his side. I listened to the action of his heart.\r\n I found that it gradually weakened, and asked Palmer to fetch some\r\n spirits of ammonia, to be used as a stimulant. When he returned, the\r\n pulsations of the heart were gradually ceasing, and life was almost\r\n extinct. Cook died very quietly a very short time afterwards. When he\r\n threw himself back in bed he clinched his hands, and they remained\r\n clinched after death. When I was rubbing his neck, his head and neck\r\n were unnaturally bent back by the spasmodic action of the muscles.\r\n After death his body was so twisted or bowed that if I had placed it\r\n upon the back it would have rested upon the head and feet!’ Now, I ask\r\n you to distinguish in any one particular between those symptoms and\r\n the symptoms of tetanic convulsions.”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“_It is not tetanus at all; not idiopathic tetanus._”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“I quite agree with you that it was not _idiopathic\r\n tetanus_. But point out any distinction that you can see between these\r\n symptoms and real _tetanus_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I do not know that there is any distinction, except that\r\n in a case of _tetanus_ I never saw rigidity continue till death and\r\n afterwards.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Can you tell me of any case of death from convulsions in\r\n which the patient was conscious to the last?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I do not know any. Convulsions occurring after poison has\r\n been taken are properly called tetanic.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Sir B. Brodie tells us that while paroxysms of tetanic\r\n convulsion last there is no difference between those that arise from\r\n strychnia and those from _tetanus_ properly so called, but only in the\r\n course the symptoms take. What do you say is the difference?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“The hands are less violently contracted; the effect of\r\n the spasm is less in ordinary _tetanus_; the convulsion, too, never\r\n entirely passes away. I have stated that _tetanus_ is a disease of\r\n days, strychnia of hours and minutes; that convulsive twitchings are\r\n in _strychnia_ the first symptoms, the last in _tetanus_; that in\r\n _tetanus_ the hands, feet, and legs are usually the last affected,\r\n while in _strychnia_ they are the first. I gave that opinion after the\r\n symptoms in the case of the lady at Leeds which were described by the\r\n witness Witham, and I still adhere to it. I never said that Cook’s was\r\n a case of _idiopathic tetanus_ in any sense of the word. It differed\r\n from the course of _tetanus_ from strychnine in the particulars I have\r\n already mentioned.”\r\n\r\n _The Attorney-General._—“Repeat them.”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“There was a sudden accession of the convulsions.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Sudden—after what?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“After the rousing by Jones. There was also the power of\r\n talking.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Don’t you know that Mrs. Smyth talked and retained her\r\n consciousness to the end: that her last words were, ‘Turn me over’?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“She did say something of that kind. No doubt those were\r\n the words she used. I believe that in poison _tetanus_ the symptoms\r\n are first observed in the legs and feet. In the animals upon which I\r\n have experimented twitchings in the ears and difficulty of breathing\r\n have been premonitory symptoms.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“When Cook felt a stiffness and difficulty of breathing,\r\n and said that he should be suffocated on the first night, what were\r\n they but premonitory symptoms?” (_question evaded_).\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Well, he asked to be rubbed; but as far as my experience\r\n goes with regard to animals—--.”\r\n\r\n _The Attorney-General._—“They can’t ask to have their ears rubbed, of\r\n course.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“The witness was about to explain the effect of\r\n being rubbed upon animals.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“In no single instance could the animals bear to be\r\n touched.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Did not Mrs. Smyth ask to have her arms and legs rubbed?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“In the Leeds case the lady asked to be rubbed before the\r\n convulsions came on, but afterwards she could not bear it, and begged\r\n not to be touched.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Can you point out any one point, after the premonitory\r\n symptoms, in which the symptoms in this case differ from those of\r\n strychnia _tetanus_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“There is the power of swallowing, which is taken away by\r\n inability to move the jaw.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“But have you not stated that lockjaw is the last symptom\r\n in strychnia _tetanus_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I have. I don’t deny that it may be. I am speaking of\r\n the general rule. In the Leeds case it came on very early, more\r\n than two hours before death, the paroxysms having continued for two\r\n and a half hours. In that case we believed the dose was four times\r\n repeated. Poison might probably be extracted by chemical process from\r\n the tissues, but I never tried it except in the case of one animal. I\r\n am not sure whether poison was in that case given through the mouth.\r\n We killed four animals in reference to the Leeds case, and in every\r\n instance we found strychnia in the contents of the stomach. In one\r\n case we administered it by two processes—one failed, and the other\r\n succeeded.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined._—“In making reports on cases such as that referred to\r\n (Leeds) we state ordinary appearances as well as extraordinary—facts\r\n without anything more.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. William Herapath, examined by Mr. Grove, Q. C._—“I am a\r\n professor of chemistry and toxicology at the Bristol Medical\r\n School—have studied chemistry for more than forty years—toxicology\r\n for thirty. Have experimented on strychnia; have seen no case of\r\n a human subject during life, but have examined a human body after\r\n death. In one case I examined the contents of the stomach, and found\r\n strychnia three days after death. I obtained evidence of strychnia\r\n by the colour tests in that case. I have experimented on animals for\r\n strychnia in eight or nine cases, and analysed the bodies in two cases\r\n where I destroyed the animals myself—both cats. I gave the first one\r\n grain of strychnia in a solid form. The animal took the poison at\r\n night, and I found it dead in the morning. It was dreadfully contorted\r\n and rigid, the limbs extended, the head turned round—not to the\r\n back, to the side—the eyes protruding and staring, the iris expanded\r\n so as to be almost invisible. I found strychnia in the urine which\r\n had been ejected, and also in the stomach, by the test I mentioned.\r\n I administered the same quantity of strychnia in a solid form to\r\n another cat. It remained very quiet for fifteen or twenty minutes, but\r\n seemed a little restless in the eyes and its breathing. In thirty-five\r\n minutes it had a terrible spasm, the extremities and the head being\r\n drawn together and the feet extended. I watched it for three hours.\r\n The first spasm lasted a minute or two. The saliva dropped from its\r\n mouth, and it forcibly ejected its urine. It had a second spasm a few\r\n minutes afterwards. It soon recovered and remained still, with the\r\n exception of a trembling all over. It continued in that state three\r\n hours. During two hours and a half it was in a very peculiar state. It\r\n appeared to be electrified all through; blowing upon it or touching\r\n the basket in which it was placed produced a kind of electric jump\r\n like a galvanic shock. I left it in three hours, thinking it would\r\n recover, but in the morning I found it dead, in the same indurated\r\n and contorted condition as the former animal. I examined the body\r\n thirty-six hours after death and found strychnia in the urine, in the\r\n stomach and in the upper intestine, in the liver, and in the blood of\r\n the heart. I have discovered strychnia in all other cases by the same\r\n tests, but I took extraordinary means to get rid of organic matter.\r\n _In all cases in which strychnia has been given I have been able to\r\n find it, but not only strychnia, but the nux vomica from which it\r\n is taken._ I have found nux vomica in a fox and other animals. The\r\n detection of nux vomica is more complicated than that of strychnia. In\r\n one case the animal had been buried two months. _I have experimented\r\n with strychnia mixed purposely with organic putrefying matter. I have\r\n found it in all cases, whatever was the state of decomposition of the\r\n matter._”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“_Are you of opinion that where strychnia has been taken\r\n in a sufficient dose to poison it can and ought to be discovered?_”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“_Yes; unless the body has been completely decomposed—that\r\n is, unless decomposition had reduced it to a dry powder. I am\r\n of opinion, from the accounts given by Dr. Taylor and the other\r\n witnesses, that if it had existed in the body of Cook it ought to have\r\n been discovered. I am aware of no cause of error in the analysis, if\r\n the organic matter had been properly got rid of._ The experiments I\r\n made were in Bristol. I have made experiments in London, and found\r\n strychnia in the stomach, liver, and blood of an animal.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by the Attorney-General._—“I don’t profess to be a\r\n toxicologist. I have principally experimented on the stomach till\r\n lately. I tried my chemical process on the 8th of this month with\r\n a view to the present case. The experiment here was on a dog. I\r\n experimented on the tissues of a cat at Bristol, and a dog in London.\r\n I found strychnia in the blood, the heart, and the urine of the cat,\r\n besides the stomach. One grain was given to the dog. It was a large\r\n dog. I have seen a cat killed with a quarter of a grain.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“_Have you not said, that you had no doubt strychnia had\r\n been taken, but that Dr. Taylor had not gone the right way to find\r\n it?_”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; certainly not.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you not said it to the present Mayor of Bristol?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I have said, if it was there Dr. Taylor ought to have\r\n found it.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you not said several times in his presence that you\r\n had no doubt strychnia had been given, but that Dr. Taylor had not\r\n found it?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I had a strong opinion from the reports in the newspapers;\r\n it is very likely I might. I don’t deny it.”\r\n\r\n _To Lord Campbell._—“From the statements I saw in the newspapers: I\r\n was not engaged in the case, and I conceived I had a right to express\r\n an opinion, the same as others. I dare say I have frequently said so\r\n in conversation. Hundreds of persons spoke to me, knowing I had made\r\n toxicology a study, and it is possible I may have said something like\r\n what you ask me about.”[57]\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by Mr. Grove._—“What is the smallest quantity of\r\n strychnia that your process is capable of detecting?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“_I am perfectly sure I could detect the 50,000th part of\r\n a grain if it was unmixed with organic matter. If I put ten grains in\r\n a gallon, or 70,000 grains of water, I could discover its presence\r\n in the tenth part of a grain of that water._ It is more difficult to\r\n detect when mixed with organic matter. If a person had taken a grain,\r\n a very small quantity would be found in the heart, but no doubt it\r\n could be found. I made four experiments with a large dog to which I\r\n had given the one-eighth part of a grain. _I have discovered it by\r\n change of colour in the thirty-second part of the liver of a dog._”\r\n\r\nIn reply to a request by Mr. Grove, Lord Campbell intimated that in the\r\nopinion of the Court experiments could not now be shown. This defect of\r\nevidence has been cured by the Vivisection Act, before referred to.\r\n\r\n _Dr. Henry Letheby, examined by Mr. Kenealy._—“I am a bachelor of\r\n medicine, professor of chemistry and toxicology in the London Hospital\r\n of Medicine, and Medical Officer of Health to the City of London. I\r\n have been engaged for a considerable time in the study of poisons and\r\n their action on the living animal economy. I have also been frequently\r\n engaged on behalf of the Crown in prosecutions in cases of this\r\n nature during the last fourteen years. I have been present during\r\n the examination of the medical witnesses, and have attended to the\r\n evidence as to the symptoms which have been described as attending\r\n the death of Cook. I have witnessed many cases of animals poisoned\r\n by strychnia, and many cases of poisoning by nux vomica in the human\r\n body, one of which was fatal. The symptoms described in this case do\r\n not accord with the symptoms I have witnessed in the case of those\r\n animals. They differ in this respect:—In the first place I never\r\n witnessed the long interval between the administration of the poison\r\n and the commencement of the symptoms which is said to have elapsed in\r\n this case. The longest interval I have known has been three-quarters\r\n of an hour, and then the poison was administered under most\r\n disadvantageous circumstances. It was given on a very full stomach\r\n and in a form uneasy of solution. I have seen the symptoms begin in\r\n five minutes. The average time in which they begin is a quarter of an\r\n hour. In all cases I have seen the system has been in that irritable\r\n state that the very lightest excitement, such as an effort to move,\r\n a touch, a noise, a breath of air, would send the patient off in\r\n convulsions. It is not at all probable that a person, after taking\r\n strychnia, could pull a bell violently. Any movement would excite\r\n the nervous system, and bring on spasms. It is not likely that a\r\n person in that state could bear to have his neck rubbed. When a case\r\n of strychnia does not end fatally, the first paroxysm is succeeded\r\n by others, gradually shaded off, the paroxysms becoming less violent\r\n every time, and I agree with Dr. Christison that they would subside\r\n in twelve or sixteen hours. I have no hesitation in saying that\r\n strychnia is, of all poisons, either mineral or vegetable, the most\r\n easy of detection. I have detected it in the stomach of animals in\r\n numerous instances, also in the blood and in the tissues. The longest\r\n period after death in which I have detected it is about a month. The\r\n animal was then in a state of decomposition. I have detected very\r\n minute portions of strychnia. When it is pure, the 20,000th part\r\n of a grain can be detected. I can detect the tenth part of a grain\r\n most easily in a pint of any liquid, whether pure or putrid. I gave\r\n one animal half a grain, and I have the strychnia here now within a\r\n very small trifle. I never failed to detect strychnia where it had\r\n been administered. I have made _post-mortem_ examinations on various\r\n animals killed by it. I have always found the right side of the heart\r\n full. The reason is that the death takes place from the fixing of the\r\n muscles of the chest by spasms, so that the blood is unable to pass\r\n through the lungs, and the heart cannot relieve itself from the blood\r\n flowing to it, and therefore becomes gorged. The lungs are congested\r\n and filled with blood. I have administered strychnia in a liquid and a\r\n solid form; I agree with Dr. Taylor that it may kill in six or eleven\r\n minutes when taken in a solid state in the form of a pill or bolus. I\r\n also agree with him that the first symptom is that the animal falls\r\n on its side, the jaws are spasmodically closed, and the slightest\r\n touch produces another paroxysm. But I do not agree with him that the\r\n colour tests are fallacious. I do not agree that it is changed when it\r\n is absorbed into the blood, but I agree with its absorption. I think\r\n it is not changed when the body is decomposed. The shaking about of\r\n the contents of the stomach with the intestines in a jar, would not\r\n prevent the discovery of strychnia, if it had been administered. Even\r\n if the contents of the stomach were lost, the mucous membrane would,\r\n in the ordinary course of things, exhibit traces of strychnia. I have\r\n studied the poison of antimony. If a quantity had been introduced into\r\n brandy-and-water, and swallowed at a gulp, the effect would not be to\r\n burn the throat. Antimony does not possess any such quality as that of\r\n immediate burning. I have turned my attention to the subject of poison\r\n for seventeen or eighteen years.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by the Attorney-General._—“I am not a member of the\r\n College of Physicians or of Surgeons. I do not now practise. I have\r\n been in general practice for two or three years. _I gave evidence in\r\n the last case of this sort, tried in this court in 1850_” (the case\r\n of Ann Merritt). “_I gave evidence of the presence of arsenic. The\r\n woman was convicted. I stated that it had been administered within\r\n four hours of death. I was the cause of her being respited, and the\r\n sentence was not carried into effect, in consequence of a letter I\r\n wrote to the Home Office. Other scientific gentlemen interfered, and\r\n challenged the soundness of my conclusions before I wrote that letter.\r\n I have not since been employed by the Crown. There has not been a case\r\n that I know of. I have been employed in prosecutions._”\r\n\r\n _By Mr. Justice Cresswell._—“I was present at the trial. I perfectly\r\n remember it.” (See the report of this case, _post_.)\r\n\r\n _Cross-examination continued._—“I detected the poison. I said in my\r\n letter that I could not speak as to possibilities, but merely as to\r\n probabilities. I have experimented on animals for a great number of\r\n years. On five recently. I have never given more than a grain, and it\r\n has always been in a solid form—in pills or bread. In the case where\r\n poison was administered under disadvantageous circumstances it was\r\n kneaded up into a hard mass of bread.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Baron Alderson._—“Did the animal bolt it or bite it?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I opened the mouth and put it into the throat. About half\r\n an hour elapsed before the symptoms appeared in one case in which\r\n half a grain had been given. In another case death took place within\r\n thirteen minutes. I have noticed twitching of the ears, difficulty\r\n of breathing, and other premonitory symptoms. There are little\r\n variations in the order in which the symptoms occur. I have known\r\n frequent instances in which an animal has died in the first paroxysm.\r\n I heard the evidence of Mrs. Smyth’s death, and I was surprised at her\r\n having got out of bed when the servant answered the bell. It is not\r\n consistent with the cases I have seen. That fact does not shake my\r\n opinion. I have no doubt that Mrs. Smyth died from strychnia. Cook’s\r\n sitting up in bed and asking Jones to ring the bell is inconsistent\r\n with what I have observed in strychnia cases.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“If a man’s breath is hurried, is it not natural for him\r\n to sit up?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is. I have seen cases of recovery of human subjects\r\n after taking strychnia. There is a great uniformity in its effects;\r\n that is, in their main features, but there is a small variation as to\r\n the time in which they are produced.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What do you attribute Cook’s death to?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is irreconcileable with everything with which I am\r\n acquainted.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is it reconcileable with any known disease you have ever\r\n seen or heard of?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”[58]\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“We are learning new facts every\r\n day, and I do not at present conceive it to be impossible that some\r\n peculiarity of the spinal cord, unrecognisable at the examination\r\n after death, may have produced symptoms like those which have been\r\n described. I, of course, include strychnia in my answer, but it is\r\n irreconcileable with everything I have seen or heard of. It is as\r\n irreconcileable with everything else; it is irreconcileable with\r\n every disease that I am acquainted with, natural or artificial.\r\n Touching an animal during the premonitory symptoms will bring on a\r\n paroxysm. Vomiting is inconsistent with strychnia. The Romsey case\r\n was an exceptional one, from the quantity of the dose. The ringing of\r\n the bell would have produced a paroxysm. I am still of opinion that\r\n the evidence I gave on the trial in 1851 is correct. I am not aware\r\n that there is any ground for an imputation upon me in respect of\r\n that evidence. I have no reason to think Government was dissatisfied\r\n with me. _I have been since employed in prosecutions, where I very\r\n much think the Crown was the prosecutor. After that case Dr. Pereira\r\n came to my laboratory, and asked me, as an act of mercy, to write a\r\n letter to him to show to the Home Office, admitting the possibility\r\n of the poison which I found in the stomach having been administered\r\n longer than four hours before death. I wrote the letter, drawing a\r\n distinction between what was possible and probable, and the woman was\r\n transported for life._”\r\n\r\nIn addition to these analytical chemists, Professor Rogers, of the St.\r\nGeorge’s Medical School, London, described an experiment he had lately\r\nmade on a dog to which he had given two grains of strychnia. He had\r\nnot taken out its stomach and its contents, together with some of the\r\nblood, until three days after death, and had put off the analysis of\r\nthe latter for _ten_ days, when it had become putrid, and that of the\r\nstomach and its contents for a month or five weeks, yet found in both\r\nportions strychnia in large quantities. This witness maintained that\r\nunless the contents of the stomach in Cook’s case had been lost, their\r\nbeing shaken would only make the process of detection more difficult,\r\nbut admitted that if strychnia had been in his stomach it would be\r\nfound smeared over its mucous membrane, which, it may be remembered,\r\nwas not sent to Dr. Taylor.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Francis Wrightson_, a pupil of Liebig, of Giessen, a teacher of\r\nchemistry at a school in Birmingham, described two similar experiments\r\non animals, with the same results as Professor Rogers. He expressed his\r\ndecided opinion that strychnia could be detected in a mixture of bile,\r\nbilious matter, and putrifying blood and in the tissues in extremely\r\nminute quantities indeed, and that five or six days after death he\r\nshould expect to find it, if it had been given—unless the dose had\r\nbeen entirely absorbed. The clearness and decision with which this\r\nwitness gave his evidence elicited the well-deserved commendation of\r\nLord Campbell. On _cross-examination_ by the _Attorney-General_, he was\r\nasked—\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Supposing that the whole dose was absorbed into the\r\n system, where would you expect to find it?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“In the blood.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Does it pass from the blood into the solids of the body?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It does, or I should rather say it is left in the solids\r\n of the body. In its progress towards its final destination, the\r\n destruction of life, it passes from the blood, or is left by the blood\r\n in the solid tissues of the body.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“If it be present in the stomach, you find it in the\r\n stomach; if it be present in the blood, you find it there; if left by\r\n the blood in the tissues, you find it there?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Precisely so.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Suppose the whole had been absorbed.”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Then I would not undertake to find it.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Suppose the whole had been eliminated from the blood,\r\n and had passed into the urine, should you expect to find it in the\r\n blood?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Suppose the minimum dose which will destroy life had\r\n been taken, and absorbed into the circulation, then deposited in the\r\n tissues, and then a part eliminated by the action of the kidneys;\r\n where would you search for it?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“In the blood, in the tissues, and in the ejections; and I\r\n would undertake to discover it in each of them.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Partridge_, the professor of Anatomy at King’s College, gave the\r\nfollowing evidence, attributing the death of Cook to the granules found\r\non his spine at the _post-mortem_ examination:—\r\n\r\n “These granules,” said the witness, “would be likely to cause\r\n inflammation, and no doubt that inflammation would have been\r\n discovered if the spinal cord or its membranes had been examined\r\n shortly after death. It would not be likely to be discovered if the\r\n spinal cord was not examined until nine weeks after death. I have\r\n not seen cases in which this inflammation has produced tetanic form\r\n of convulsions, but such cases are on record. It sometimes does, and\r\n sometimes does not produce convulsions and death.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Can you form any judgment as to the cause of death in\r\n Cook’s case?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I cannot. No conclusion or inference can be drawn from the\r\n degree or kind of the contractions of the body after death.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Campbell._—“Can you not say from the symptoms you heard whether\r\n death was produced by _tetanus_, without saying what was the cause of\r\n _tetanus_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Hypothetically I should infer that he died of the form of\r\n _tetanus_ which convulses the muscles. Great varieties of rigidity\r\n arise after death from natural causes. The half-bent hands and fingers\r\n are not uncommon after natural death. The arching of the feet in this\r\n case seemed to me rather greater than usual.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by the Attorney-General._—“Granules are sometimes,\r\n but not commonly, found about the spine of a healthy subject,—not\r\n on the cord itself; they may exist consistently with health. No\r\n satisfactory cases of the inflammation I have described have come\r\n under my notice without producing convulsions. It is a very rare\r\n disease. I cannot state from the recorded cases the course of the\r\n symptoms of that disease. It varies in duration, sometimes lasting\r\n only for days, sometimes much longer. If the patient lives it is\r\n accompanied with paralysis. It produces no effect on the brain which\r\n is recognisable after death. It would not affect the brain prior to\r\n death. I do not know whether it is attended with loss of sensibility\r\n before death. The size of the granules which will produce it varies.\r\n This disease is not a matter of months, unless it terminates in palsy.\r\n I never heard of a case in which the patient died after a single\r\n convulsion. Between the intervals of the convulsions I don’t believe\r\n a man could have twenty-four hours’ repose. Pain and spasms would\r\n accompany the convulsions. I cannot form a judgment as to whether the\r\n general health would be affected in the intervals between them.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You have heard it stated that from the midnight of\r\n Monday till Tuesday Cook had complete repose. Now, I ask you, in the\r\n face of the medical profession, whether you think the symptoms which\r\n have been described proceeded from that disease?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I should think not.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Did you ever know the hands completely clinched after\r\n death except in case of tetanus?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you ever known it even in _idiopathic_ or\r\n _traumatic tetanus_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I have never seen _idiopathic tetanus_. I have seen the\r\n hands completely clinched in _traumatic tetanus_. A great deal of\r\n force is often required to separate them.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you ever known the feet so distorted as to assume\r\n the form of a club foot?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You heard Mr. Jones state that if he had turned the body\r\n upon the back it would have rested on the head and the heels. Have you\r\n any doubt that that is an indication of death from tetanus?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; it is a form of tetanic spasm. I am only acquainted\r\n with _tetanus_ resulting from strychnia by reading. Some of the\r\n symptoms in Cook’s case are consistent, some are inconsistent with\r\n strychnia _tetanus_. The first inconsistent symptom is the intervals\r\n that occurred between the taking of the supposed poison and the\r\n attacks.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Are not symptoms of bending of the body, difficulty of\r\n respiration, convulsions in the throat, legs, and arms, perfectly\r\n consistent with what you know of the symptoms of death from strychnia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Perfectly consistent. I have known cases of _traumatic\r\n tetanus_. The symptoms in those cases had been occasionally remitted,\r\n never wholly terminated. I never knew _traumatic tetanus_ run its\r\n course to death in less than three or four days. I never knew a\r\n complete case of the operation of strychnia upon a human subject.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Bearing in mind the distinction between _traumatic_ and\r\n _idiopathic tetanus_, did you ever know of such a death as that of\r\n Cook according to the symptoms you have heard described?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined by Mr. Grove._—“Besides the symptom which I have\r\n mentioned as being inconsistent with the theory of death by strychnia,\r\n there are others—namely, sickness, beating the bed clothes, want\r\n of sensitiveness to external impressions, and sudden cessation of\r\n the convulsions and apparent complete recovery. There was apparently\r\n an absence of the usual muscular agitation. Symptoms of convulsive\r\n character arising from an injury to the spine vary considerably in\r\n their degrees of violence, in their periods of intermission, and in\r\n the muscles which are attacked. Intermission of the disease occurs,\r\n but is not frequent in _traumatic tetanus_. I don’t remember that\r\n death has ever taken place in fifteen hours; it may take place in\r\n forty-eight hours during convulsions. Granules about the spine are\r\n more unusual in young people than in old. I don’t know of any case\r\n in which the spine can preserve its integrity, so as to be properly\r\n examined, for a period of nine weeks. I should not feel justified in\r\n inferring that there was no disease from not finding any at the end\r\n of that time. The period of decomposition varies from a few hours to\r\n a few days. It is not in the least probable that it could be delayed\r\n for nine weeks.”\r\n\r\n _By the Attorney-General._—“Supposing the stomach were acted on by\r\n other causes, I do not think sickness would be inconsistent with\r\n _tetanus_.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to the existence of these granules, _Mr. Oliver\r\nPemberton_, anatomical lecturer at Queen’s College, Birmingham, who was\r\npresent with Professor Bolton when Cook’s body was exhumed, in January,\r\nfor the special purpose of arriving at a more satisfactory decision\r\non this point than had been effected at the first _post-mortem_\r\nexamination, was called for the defence. He gave it as his opinion, in\r\nwhich Professor Bolton agreed, that the spinal cord was not then in a\r\ncondition to enable him to judge as to what was its state immediately\r\nafter death; the upper part, where it separated from the brain, being\r\ngreen from decomposition, and the other part, though better preserved,\r\nnot soft enough for that purpose. This point was, therefore, left in a\r\nfar from satisfactory position.\r\n\r\nA _Dr. G. Robinson_, of the Newcastle-on-Tyne Dispensary, also\r\nsupported the spinal granules theory, and considered that from his\r\nhabits of life Cook was predisposed to epilepsy. He admitted, however,\r\non _cross-examination_, that “he had never seen symptoms of epilepsy\r\nproceed to anything like the extent as in Cook’s case; never saw a\r\nbody so stiff in epilepsy as to rest on its head and heels; nor such\r\nsymptoms, except in tetanus, and that the extreme form of epilepsy was\r\nalways accompanied by unconsciousness.” “The granules,” he thought,\r\n“were likely to have irritated the spinal cord, and yet no indications\r\nremain after death; they might have produced Cook’s death.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“But do you think so?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Putting aside the assumption of strychnia, I should say\r\n so.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“_Are not all the symptoms reported by Mr. Jones\r\n indicative of death by strychnia?_”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“_They certainly are._”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“Then it comes to this, that if there were no\r\n other cause of death suggested, you should say it arose from epilepsy?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes. Epilepsy is a well-known disease which includes many\r\n others, and the convulsions of that disease sometimes assume tetanic\r\n appearances.”\r\n\r\nThe last important medical witness called for the defence, _Dr.\r\nBenjamin Ward Richardson_, physician, of London, took the prosecution\r\nsomewhat by surprise by attributing Cook’s death to _Angina\r\npectoris_, a cause not as yet hinted at. As the counsel for the\r\nCrown were not prepared with information requisite for an effective\r\n_cross-examination_ on this point, at the close of the prisoner’s case\r\nthe Attorney-General asked leave to recall this witness, as he was then\r\nprepared with the books required for that purpose. The Court, however,\r\nrefused the application, and the evidence therefore must be accepted\r\nwith caution.\r\n\r\n _Dr. Richardson_ said:—“I am a physician, practising in London. I\r\n have never seen a case of _tetanus_, properly so called, but I have\r\n seen many cases of death by convulsions. In many instances they have\r\n presented tetanic appearances without being strictly tetanus. I have\r\n seen the muscles fixed, especially those of the upper part of the\r\n body. I have observed the arms stiffened out, and the hands closely\r\n and firmly clinched until death. I have also observed a sense of\r\n suffocation in the patient. In some forms of convulsions I have seen\r\n contortions both of the legs and the feet, and the patient generally\r\n expresses a wish to sit up. I have known persons die of a disease\r\n called angina pectoris. The symptoms of that disease, I consider,\r\n resemble closely those of Mr. Cook. Angina pectoris comes under the\r\n denomination of spasmodic diseases. In some cases the disease is\r\n detectable upon _post-mortem_ examination; in others it is not. I\r\n attended one case. A girl ten years old was under my care in 1850. I\r\n supposed she had suffered from scarlet fever. She recovered so far\r\n that my visits ceased. I left her amused and merry in the morning; at\r\n half-past ten in the evening I was called in to see her, and I found\r\n her dying. She was supported upright at her own request, her face\r\n was pale, the muscles of the face rigid, the arms rigid, the fingers\r\n clinched, the respiratory muscles completely fixed and rigid, and\r\n with all this there was combined intense agony and restlessness, such\r\n as I have never witnessed. There was perfect consciousness. The child\r\n knew me, described her agony, and eagerly took some brandy and water\r\n from a spoon. I left for the purpose of obtaining some chloroform from\r\n my own house, which was thirty yards distant. When I returned her head\r\n was drawn back, and I could detect no respiration; the eyes were then\r\n fixed open, and the body just resembled a statue; she was dead. On\r\n the following day I made a _post-mortem_ examination. The brain was\r\n slightly congested; the upper part of the spinal cord seemed healthy;\r\n the lungs were collapsed; the heart was in such a state of firm spasm\r\n and solidity, and so emptied of blood, that I remarked that it might\r\n have been rinsed out. I could not discover any appearance of disease\r\n that would account for the death, except a slight effusion of serum in\r\n one pleural cavity. I never could ascertain any cause for the death.\r\n The child went to bed well and merry, and immediately afterwards\r\n jumped up, screamed, and exclaimed, ‘I am going to die.’”\r\n\r\n _By the Attorney-General._—“I consider that the symptoms I have\r\n described were those of angina pectoris. It is the opinion of Dr.\r\n Jenner that this disease is occasioned by the ossification of some of\r\n the small vessels of the heart. I did not find that to be the case\r\n in this instance. There have been many cases where no cause whatever\r\n was discovered. It is called angina pectoris, from its causing such\r\n extreme anguish to the chest. I do not think the symptoms I have\r\n described were such as would result from taking strychnia. There is\r\n this difference,—that rubbing the hands gives ease to the patient in\r\n cases of angina pectoris. I must say there would be great difficulty\r\n in detecting the difference in cases of angina pectoris and strychnia.\r\n As regards symptoms I know of no difference between the two. I am\r\n bound to say that if I had known so much of these subjects as I do\r\n now, in the case I have referred to I should have gone on to analysis\r\n to endeavour to detect strychnia. In the second case I discovered\r\n organic disease of the heart, which was quite sufficient to account\r\n for the symptoms. The disease of angina pectoris comes on quite\r\n suddenly, and does not give any notice of its approach. I did not send\r\n any note of this case to any medical publication. It is not at all an\r\n uncommon occurrence to find the hands firmly clinched after death in\r\n cases of natural disease.”\r\n\r\n _By Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“There are cases of angina pectoris in which\r\n the patient has recovered and appeared perfectly well for a period of\r\n twenty-four hours, and then the attack has returned. I am of opinion\r\n that the fact of the recurrence of the second fit in Cook’s case is\r\n more the symptom of angina pectoris than of strychnia poison.”[59]\r\n\r\n _Dr. Wrightson_ was recalled, and in answer to a question put by Mr.\r\n Serjeant Shee he said it was his opinion that when the strychnia\r\n poison was absorbed in the system it was diffused throughout the\r\n entire system.\r\n\r\n _By the Attorney-General._—“The longer time that elapsed before the\r\n death would render the absorption more complete. If a minimum dose to\r\n destroy life were given, and a long interval elapsed to the death,\r\n the more complete would be the absorption and the less the chance of\r\n finding it in the stomach.”\r\n\r\n _By Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“I should expect still to find it in the\r\n spleen and liver and blood.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCASES OF _TETANUS_ BROUGHT FORWARD FOR THE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the cases of undoubted poisoning by strychnia proved on\r\nthe part of the prosecution, four cases of _tetanus_ were brought\r\nforward on behalf of the prisoner, with the object of showing that\r\nthe symptoms then exhibited were identical with those in Cook’s case,\r\nand, therefore, raising the presumption that he might have died from\r\nordinary tetanic convulsions, and not from those produced by strychnia.\r\n\r\nThe first of these cases was described by _Mr. Robert Edward Gay_,\r\na member of the College of Surgeons, who had attended a patient of\r\nthe name of _Forster_ for _tetanus_ in October, 1855. Apparently,\r\nat first the patient was suffering only from sore throat and its\r\nusual attendant pains in the neck and upper portion of the spine,\r\nfor which he was duly treated. On the fourth day of his illness the\r\nmuscular pains extended to the face, and particularly to the lower\r\njaw, and by evening lockjaw had come on, with pains of the muscles of\r\nthe bowels, legs, and arms. “He became very convulsed throughout the\r\nentire muscular system, had frequent involuntary contractions of the\r\narms, hands, and legs; his difficulty of swallowing increased, and\r\nnot a particle of food, solid or liquid, could be introduced into the\r\nmouth, the attempt to do so bringing on violent convulsions; so strong\r\nwere they, that I could compare him to nothing but a piece of warped\r\nboard.” The head was thrown back, the abdomen thrust forward, the\r\nlegs frequently drawn up and contracted; the attempt to feed him with\r\na spoon, the opening a window, or placing the fingers on the pulse,\r\nbrought on violent convulsions. While the patient was suffering in\r\nthis manner, he complained of great hunger, repeatedly exclaimed that\r\nhe was hungry, and could not eat. He was kept alive _to the fourteenth\r\nday_ entirely by injections of a milky and farinaceous character. He\r\nwas insensible on the 12th, and continued so till he died. There was\r\nno sore or hurt about his body, and Mr. Gay attributed his death to\r\nan inflammatory sore throat, from cold and exposure to the weather,\r\nassuming a tetanic form, from the patient being a very nervous,\r\nexcited, and anxious person. Mr. Gay, whilst satisfied that this was\r\na case of _idiopathic tetanus_, admitted that he never met with such\r\nanother case; that it was altogether progressive from the first onset;\r\nthat although for a short time there was a remission of symptoms, they\r\ninvariably recurred, and that the locking of the jaw was the very first\r\nsymptom that made its appearance.\r\n\r\nIn another case, at the Royal Free Hospital, in 1843, on the 28th of\r\nJuly, a boy was brought in with the middle toe of his left foot smashed\r\nby a stone, which Mr. John Gay amputated. The accident had happened\r\na week before, and the wound became very unhealthy. When the surgeon\r\nfirst saw him, his mouth was almost closed, and continued so until the\r\n1st of August, but a small quantity of medicine could be introduced.\r\n\r\n “During the first three days,” said _Mr. J. Gay_, “his paroxysms\r\n were of unusual severity; he complained of a stiff neck, and during\r\n the first night started up and was convulsed. On the following night\r\n he was again convulsed. At times the abdominal muscles, as well as\r\n those of the legs and back, were rigid, and the muscles of the face\r\n in a state of great contraction. He was in the same state the next\r\n day, but at two o’clock there was much less rigidity of the muscles,\r\n especially those of the abdomen and back. On the following morning\r\n the rigidity had gone, he opened his mouth and could talk; he was\r\n thoroughly relieved. He had no return of spasms till half-past five on\r\n the following day. He then asked the nurse to change his linen, and\r\n as she lifted him up in bed to do so, violent convulsions of the arms\r\n and face came on, and he died in a few minutes. About thirty hours\r\n elapsed between the preceding convulsion and the one which ended his\r\n life. Before the paroxysm came on the rigidity had been completely\r\n relaxed. Tartar emetic (containing antimony), which I gave on the\r\n second and third day, did not produce vomiting; the rigidity of the\r\n muscles of the chest would go far to prevent it. The wound might\r\n have rubbed against the bed when he was raised, but I don’t think it\r\n possible. Some peculiar irritation of the nerves would give rise to\r\n the affection of the spinal cord. There may be various causes for this\r\n irritation of the spinal cord, which ends in _tetanus_, but it would\r\n be very difficult merely from seeing symptoms of _tetanus_, and in the\r\n absence of knowledge of how it had been occasioned, to ascribe it to\r\n any particular cause. No doubt the death took place in consequence of\r\n something produced by the injury of the toe.”\r\n\r\nThe seriousness of the wound in this case, in comparison with any\r\nsigns of wounds found on Cook’s body, and the severity of the shock\r\noccasioned by such a painful accident, renders this example almost\r\nvalueless.\r\n\r\nIn a third case, at the London Hospital, on the 22nd of March of 1856,\r\na patient, aged thirty-seven, was brought in about half-past seven\r\nin the evening. When in the receiving room, he had one paroxysm, and\r\nanother soon after when in the ward. After the first, his pulse was\r\nfeeble and rapid, his jaws closed and fixed, an expression of anxiety\r\non his countenance, and his features sunken; he was unable to swallow,\r\nand the muscles of the abdomen and the back were somewhat tense. After\r\nthe second paroxysm, his body became arched for about a minute. He was\r\nquieter for a few minutes, had a third attack, and died. He had some\r\nold neglected sores of a chronic character, particularly at the right\r\nelbow, a peculiarly sensitive spot, and Mr. Ross, the house-surgeon,\r\nwho attended the case, admitted that the disease had been coming on\r\nsince the morning, that he had felt symptoms of lockjaw at breakfast,\r\nand had had successive attacks all the afternoon before coming to the\r\nhospital. Here again the case had been progressive until death, and\r\ncommenced with lockjaw, the admitted signs of ordinary tetanus as\r\ndistinguished from that due to poison.\r\n\r\nThe last case proved was that of _Catherine Wilson_, of Garnkirk, near\r\nGlasgow, who “was attacked with a fit,” as she deposed, “in October\r\nlast year at night, felt heavy all the day from the morning, but had\r\nno pain till night. My first pain,” she said, “was in the stomach,\r\nand then I had cramp in the arm, and became quite insensible.” By\r\nthe administration of chloroform the spasms were relieved, and she\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n_Dr. William Macdonald_, of Edinburgh, who saw the case about an hour\r\nafter the attack, admitted that lockjaw came on in about an hour or two\r\nafter he was called in.\r\n\r\nThis witness was also put forward as a medical expert in cases of\r\nstrychnia, and attributed Cook’s death to “epileptic convulsions\r\nwith tetanic complications,” and was subjected to the following\r\n_cross-examination_ by the _Attorney-General_:—\r\n\r\n “I believe,” said _Dr. Macdonald_, “that all convulsive diseases,\r\n including the epileptic forms and the various tetanic complications,\r\n arise from the decomposition of the blood acting upon the nerves. Any\r\n mental excitement might have caused Cook’s death. Cook was excited at\r\n Shrewsbury, and whenever there is excitement there is a consequent\r\n depression. I think Cook was afterwards depressed. When a man is lying\r\n in bed and vomiting he must be depressed.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“This gentleman was much overjoyed at his horse\r\n winning, and you think he vomited in consequence?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It might predispose him to vomit.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“I am not speaking of ‘mights.’ Do you think that\r\n the excitement of three minutes on the course on Tuesday accounts for\r\n the vomiting on Wednesday night.?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I do not. I find no symptoms of excitement or depression\r\n reported between that time and his death. The white spots found in the\r\n stomach of the deceased might, by producing an inflammatory condition\r\n of the stomach, have brought on the convulsions that caused death.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“But the gentlemen who made the _post-mortem_\r\n examination say that the stomach was not inflamed.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“There were white spots, which cannot exist without\r\n inflammation. There must have been inflammation.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“But these gentlemen say there was not.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I do not believe them. Sexual excitement might cause\r\n epileptic convulsions with tetanic complications. The chancre\r\n and syphilitic sores were evidence that Cook had undergone such\r\n excitement. That might have occurred before he was at Shrewsbury.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“Might sexual excitement produce epilepsy a\r\n fortnight after it occurred?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“There is an instance on record in which epilepsy\r\n supervened upon the very act of intercourse.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“Have you any instance in which epilepsy came on\r\n a fortnight afterwards?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It is within the range of possibility.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“Do you mean as a serious man of science to say\r\n so?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“The results might.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“What results were there in this case?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“The chancre and the syphilitic sores.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“Did you ever hear of a chancre causing epilepsy?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“Did you ever dream of such a thing.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I never heard of it.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“Did you ever hear of any other form of\r\n syphilitic disease producing epilepsy?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No; but _tetanus_.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“But you say that this was epilepsy. We are not\r\n talking of _tetanus_.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“You forget the tetanic complication.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“If I understand it right then, the sexual\r\n excitement produces epilepsy, and the chancre superadds tetanic\r\n complications.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I say the results of sexual excitement produce epilepsy.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“What would be the effect of morphia given a day\r\n or two previously; would it not retard the action of the poison?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No. I have seen opium bring on convulsions very nearly\r\n similar.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“What quantity?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“A grain and a half. From my experience, I think if\r\n morphia had been given a day or two before, it would have accelerated\r\n the action of the strychnia. If this were a case of poisoning by\r\n strychnia, I should suppose that as both opium and strychnia produce\r\n congestion of the brain, they would act together and have a more\r\n speedy effect. If congestion of the brain was coming on when morphia\r\n was given to Cook on the Sunday and Monday nights it might have\r\n increased rather than allayed it.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“But the gentlemen who examined the body say\r\n there was no congestion after death.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“But Dr. Bamford says there was.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“You stick to Dr. Bamford.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes; because he was a man of experience and could judge\r\n much better than younger men, and was not so likely to be mistaken.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“But Dr. Bamford says that Cook died of apoplexy.\r\n Do you think it was apoplexy?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No; it was not.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“What then do you think of Dr. Bamford, who\r\n certified that it was?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“That was a matter of opinion, but the existence of\r\n congestion on the brain he saw.”\r\n\r\n _Attorney-General._—“The other medical men said there was none.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Campbell._—“That is rather a matter of reasoning than of\r\n evidence.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus reported the medico-scientific evidence _pro_ and _con_, we\r\npass on to the moral evidence—the purchase of poison by the prisoner,\r\nand his acts during Cook’s illness and subsequent to his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF POISON BY PALMER.\r\n\r\nThe proof that Palmer purchased strychnia on two separate occasions\r\nimmediately before the convulsive attacks of which Cook died rested on\r\nthe evidence of two druggists’ assistants at Rugeley. One of these,\r\n_Charles Newton_, assistant to _Mr. Salt_, swore that about nine\r\no’clock on the Monday evening, the 19th of November, Palmer came to his\r\nmaster’s shop, asked for three grains of strychnia, which he gave him,\r\nwithout charge, as he knew him as a medical practitioner of the town.\r\nNext morning, between eleven and twelve, _Roberts_, the assistant of\r\n_Hawkins_, another druggist in Rugeley, was asked by Palmer for two\r\ndrachms of prussic acid, for which he brought a bottle with him. Whilst\r\n_Roberts_ was preparing this, _Newton_, the former witness, came into\r\nthe shop, and Palmer, putting his hand on _Newton’s_ shoulder, said\r\nhe wished to speak with him, and together they stepped out into the\r\nstreet, when Palmer asked some questions about Mr. Edwin Salt going to\r\na farm about fourteen miles from Rugeley. Whilst they were talking, a\r\n_Mr. Brassington_ joined them, and began to speak to _Newton_ about\r\nsome accounts for Mr. Salt, on which Palmer went back into Hawkins’s\r\nshop and asked for six grains of strychnia and two drachms of Batley’s\r\nsolution of opium.\r\n\r\n “Whilst I was preparing them,” said _Roberts_, “Palmer stood at the\r\n shop door with his back to me, looking into the street. I was about\r\n five minutes preparing them. He stood at the door till they were\r\n ready, when I delivered them to him—the prussic acid in the bottle he\r\n had brought, the strychnia in a paper, and the opium in a bottle. He\r\n paid, and took them away. No one else was in the shop.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Palmer had left, Newton came in, and spoke to Roberts\r\nabout Palmer’s visit, and no doubt was struck with the information\r\nhe received. At that time he did not mention to his master Palmer’s\r\npurchase of the strychnia because, he said, Palmer and Salt were not\r\nfriends, and he was afraid that the latter might blame him for having\r\ngiven Palmer the strychnia. “I first mentioned it,” said _Newton_,\r\n“to Boycott, the clerk to Mr. Gardner, the solicitor, at the Rugeley\r\nstation, when I and a number of witnesses were assembled for the\r\npurpose of going to London. He took me to Mr. Gardner’s. I told him\r\nwhat I had to say, and he took me to the solicitor of the Treasury.”\r\nCounsel for the defence tried to elicit from him that he had given as\r\nhis reason for not mentioning it before that he was afraid of being\r\nprosecuted for perjury. “No,” he replied; “I did not give that as a\r\nreason, but I stated to a gentleman that a young man at Wolverhampton\r\nhad been threatened by George Palmer because he had said at the inquest\r\non Walter Palmer that he had sold the prisoner prussic acid, and he had\r\nnot entered it in the book, and could not prove it. I stated at the\r\nsame time that George Palmer said he could be transported for it. The\r\ninquest on Walter Palmer did not take place until five or six weeks\r\nafter that on Cook.”\r\n\r\nNot only, however, did Newton[60] not mention this purchase of\r\nstrychnia when before the coroner, but he did not state that on the\r\n25th of November he was sent for about seven in the evening to Palmer’s\r\nhouse, where he found the prisoner in his kitchen, sitting by the fire\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n “He asked me,” he now said, “how I was, and to have some brandy\r\n and water. No one else was there. He asked me what was the dose\r\n of strychnia to kill a dog. I told him a grain. He asked me what\r\n would be the appearance after death. I told him that there would be\r\n no inflammation, and that I did not think it could be found. Upon\r\n that he snapped his finger and thumb in a quiet way and exclaimed,\r\n as if communing with himself, ‘That’s all right.’ He made some\r\n other commonplace remark, which I do not recollect. I was with him\r\n altogether about five minutes.”\r\n\r\nThough he appears to have related the story of the dog at an earlier\r\ndate, it was not until the Tuesday before the trial that he said a word\r\nto anyone about the purchase of the strychnia.\r\n\r\nTo contradict the evidence of Newton, the inspector of police at the\r\nEuston station was called to prove that the last train for Rugeley\r\nleft at 2P.M., and that if Palmer went by the five o’clock express\r\nhe would not get to Stafford until 8.45, and would then have nine\r\nmiles to travel to reach Rugeley. It was, however, remarked by the\r\nAttorney-General that Newton’s words were “about nine o’clock,” and\r\n“that everyone knows how easy it is to make a mistake of half an hour\r\nor three quarters of an hour, or even an hour, if your attention is\r\nnot called to the circumstances within a week or a fortnight, or\r\nthree weeks afterwards.” Not content with this evidence, counsel for\r\nthe defence called one Jeremiah Smith, an attorney, of Rugeley, and\r\nintimate friend of the prisoner’s mother, who swore that on the night\r\nin question he saw Palmer get out of a car coming in the direction\r\nfrom Stafford at ten minutes past ten, and went with him to Cook’s\r\nroom. The exhibition made by this fellow in the box was disgusting. For\r\nsome time he declared that he had never had anything to do with the\r\napplications for the enormous insurances on Walter Palmer’s life; would\r\nnot acknowledge his signature to them as a witness, and only after a\r\nmost vigorous _cross-examination_ admitted that he witnessed them on\r\nthe application of the prisoner. He it was who made the application to\r\nthe Midland Insurance Company for the policy of £10,000 on the life of\r\nBate, the person whom Palmer represented as a gentleman of property\r\nwith a fine cellar of wine, but whom the insurance agent found hoeing\r\nturnips in a field of Palmer’s, and with six months’ rent in arrear for\r\nthe room in the farm-house which he occupied. The credit of Newton was\r\nset up by the desperate attempt of Mr. Jeremiah Smith.[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nACTS OF THE PRISONER DURING COOK’S ILLNESS AND AFTER HIS DEATH.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 15th of November, Cook returned from Shrewsbury with\r\nPalmer to the “Talbot,” at Rugeley, complaining of being poorly. It\r\nwill be remembered that he had been sick at Shrewsbury after partaking\r\nof the brandy and water in Palmer’s company. Next day he dined with\r\nPalmer, and came back to the inn between nine and ten at night, as the\r\nwitness Barnes said, sober. Early the next morning (Saturday) Palmer\r\nwas in his bedroom, and sent for a cup of coffee for him. Mills, who\r\nbrought it up, did not see him drink it; but when soon after she went\r\ninto his room she found he had vomited it in the chamber. Palmer was\r\nin and out frequently, and promised to send Cook some soup; for this\r\nhe sent _Ann Rowley_, a charwoman to the “Albion Inn,” who brought it\r\nto Palmer in his kitchen, left it there about five minutes with him,\r\nwhilst she went about her other work, and then, by Palmer’s orders,\r\ntook it to the “Talbot,” with a message that Jerry Smith, a mutual\r\nfriend who had dined with them on the Friday, had sent it.[62] Cook,\r\nseeming unwilling to take this, Palmer said he must have it. It was\r\ntaken up again; Cook drank it, and shortly after vomited. Again, on the\r\nSunday, Palmer sent a jobbing gardener in his employ with a covered\r\ncup of broth to the “Talbot,” of which Mills, who took it up to Cook’s\r\nroom, tasted about two tablespoonsful, and was so sick that she had to\r\ngo to bed. Whether Cook drank this or not was not distinctly proved,\r\nbut the cup was afterwards seen empty in the kitchen of the hotel. What\r\nfollowed as to the pills sent by Dr. Bamford, and the others produced\r\nby Palmer, is already fully given in Mills’s evidence. Immediately\r\nafter Cook’s death, Palmer was found by Barnes searching the pockets of\r\nCook’s coat and under his pillow, and the bank-notes which Cook had had\r\nonly a few days before, his betting-book, which had been seen on his\r\ndressing-table, and the letters that had been on his chimney-piece, had\r\ndisappeared.[63] Previously to this time Palmer had been very short of\r\nmoney, being pressed for small debts, but immediately afterwards was\r\nin funds, paying small bills, and depositing £50 in a local bank. On\r\nTuesday evening (20th), when Cook was in such a serious state, Palmer\r\nsent for Cheshire, the Rugeley postmaster, and asked him to fill up\r\nthe body of a cheque on Weatherby for £350 in Palmer’s favour, which\r\nhe said that he would take over to Cook to sign. That cheque was\r\nsent to Weatherby’s that night, and returned by them to Palmer, as\r\nWeatherby, not having yet received the stakes Cook had won, was not in\r\nfunds to meet it. That cheque was called for by the prosecution, but\r\nnot produced by the prisoner. Again, on the Thursday or Friday after,\r\nbetween six and seven in the evening, Palmer sent for Cheshire. “When\r\nI arrived,” said the witness, “I found him in the kitchen, and he\r\nimmediately went out, and shortly after returned with a quarto sheet of\r\npaper in his hand. He gave me a pen, and asked me to sign something. I\r\nasked what it was, and he replied, ‘You know that Cook and I have had\r\ndealings together, and this is a document he gave me some days ago,\r\nand I want you to witness it.’ I said, ‘What is it about?’ He said,\r\n‘Some business that I have joined in with him, and which is all for his\r\nbenefit, and this is the document stating so.’” Cheshire refused, and\r\nPalmer, saying perhaps they would not dispute Cook’s signature, took it\r\naway. This document was also called for, and not produced.[64]\r\n\r\nOn Friday, 23rd, _Mr. Stevens_, who had married the widow of Cook’s\r\nfather some years before, and was executor to his grandfather’s will,\r\narrived in Rugeley, saw Palmer, and asked him about his stepson’s\r\naffairs. “There are £4000 of his bills out,” said Palmer, “and I am\r\nsorry to say my name is to them, but I have got a paper drawn up and\r\nsigned by him to show that I never had any money from them.” Mr.\r\nStevens expressed great surprise, and said, “I fear there will not\r\nbe 4000 shillings to pay you.” Then, after discussing his stepson’s\r\naffairs, Mr. Stevens said, “Well, whether he has left anything or not,\r\npoor fellow, he must be buried,” on which Palmer immediately said,\r\n“Oh, I will bury him myself, if that is all.” Mr. Stevens at once\r\nrefused, and expressed his intention of removing the body to London\r\nfor interment, so as not to inconvenience the inn people. “Oh,” said\r\nPalmer, “that is of no consequence, but the body ought to be fastened\r\nup; as long as the body is fastened up, it is of no consequence.”\r\nWhilst Mr. Stevens was talking with the persons in the room, Palmer\r\nwent out, and on his return, when asked by Stevens to recommend an\r\nundertaker, said, “I have been and done this. I have ordered a shell\r\nand a strong oak coffin.” Mr. Stevens expressed his surprise, and\r\ninsisted on giving instructions himself to the undertaker.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, after dinner, on Mr. Jones reporting to Stevens,\r\nwho had asked him to go up to Cook’s room for that purpose, that he\r\ncould not find any betting-book or papers, Palmer said, “Oh, it’s no\r\nmanner of use if you do find it.” “No use,” replied Stevens, “I am the\r\nbest judge of that.” Again said Palmer, “It’s of no manner of use.”\r\n“I am told it is,” was the reply; “my son won a great deal of money\r\nat Shrewsbury, and I ought to know something about it.” “It is of no\r\nuse, I assure you,” replied Palmer; “when a man dies, his bets are done\r\nwith; and besides, Cook received the greater part of the money on the\r\ncourse.” “Very well,” replied Stevens, “the book ought to be found, and\r\nmust be found,” when Palmer said, in a quieter tone, “It will be found,\r\nno doubt.” The room was then locked by Mr. Stevens’s order, but the\r\nbook was never found.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens returned to London to see his solicitor, and on his way\r\nback met Palmer (who had been to London to pay Pratt £100, and caution\r\nhim against giving any information about Cook’s affairs), and told\r\nhim his intention of having a _post-mortem_ examination. Apparently\r\nagreeing with that, Palmer offered to introduce him to a local\r\nsolicitor to conduct it, which was declined; but, added Mr. Stevens, “I\r\nsaid, ‘Mr. Palmer, if I should call in a solicitor to give me advice,\r\nI suppose you will have no objection to answer any question he may put\r\nto you.’ I altered my tone purposely; I looked him steadily in the\r\nface, but although the moon was shining, I could not see his features\r\ndistinctly. He said, with a spasmodic convulsion of the throat, which\r\nwas perfectly apparent, ‘Oh no, certainly not.’” Later in the evening\r\nPalmer came to Mr. Stevens and renewed his conversation about the\r\nbills, hoping that affairs would be settled pleasantly, and was told by\r\nthe stepfather that “they could be only settled in Chancery.” Palmer,\r\nat that time, denied that he had attended Cook in a medical capacity.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of November, _Ishmael Fisher_, who was Cook’s usual racing\r\nagent, received a letter from Cook requesting him to pay Pratt £200,\r\nwhich he would repay him on the following Monday, when the Shrewsbury\r\nbets would be settled at Tattersall’s. Much to his surprise, he was not\r\nemployed as usual, and in consequence lost the money he had advanced,\r\nfor on the 19th _Mr. George Herring_, another betting man, got a letter\r\nfrom Palmer to call on him at the latter’s lodgings, in London, at\r\nhalf-past two that day. He did so.\r\n\r\n “I found Palmer there,” said _Herring_. “He asked me what I would\r\n take. I declined to take anything. I then asked him how Mr. Cook was.\r\n He said, ‘He’s all right; his physician gave him a dose of calomel,\r\n and advised him not to come out, it being a damp day.’ I don’t know\r\n which term he used, ‘damp’ or ‘wet.’ He then went on to say, in the\r\n same sentence, ‘What I want to see you about is settling his account.’\r\n While he was speaking he took out half a sheet of note paper from his\r\n pocket, and it was open when he had finished the sentence. He held it\r\n up and said, ‘This is it.’ I rose to take it. He said, ‘You had better\r\n take its contents down; this will be a check against you.’ At the same\r\n time he pointed to some paper lying on the table. I wrote on that\r\n paper from his dictation. I have here the paper which I so wrote. [The\r\n witness read the document in question, which contained instructions\r\n as to certain payments he should make out of moneys to be received by\r\n him at Tattersall’s on account of the Shrewsbury races.] Palmer then\r\n said that I had better write out a cheque for Pratt and Padwick—for\r\n the former £450, and for the latter £350, and send them at once. I\r\n told him I had only one form of cheque in my pocket. He said I could\r\n easily fill up a draught on half a sheet of paper. I refused to comply\r\n with his request, as I had not as yet received the money. He replied\r\n that it would be all right, for that Cook would not deceive me. He\r\n wished me particularly to pay Mr. Pratt the £450. His words, as nearly\r\n as I can remember them, were, ‘You must pay Pratt, as it is for a bill\r\n of sale on the mare.’ I don’t know whether he said ‘a bill of sale,’\r\n or ‘a joint bill of sale.’ He told me he was going to see both Pratt\r\n and Padwick, to tell them that I would send on the money. Previous to\r\n his saying this, I told him that if he would give me the address of\r\n Pratt and Padwick I would call on them, after I had got the money from\r\n Tattersall’s, and give it to them. He then asked me what was between\r\n us. There were only a few pounds between us, and after we had had\r\n some conversation on the point, he took out of his pocket a £50 Bank\r\n of England note. He required £29 out of the note, and I was not able\r\n to give it; but he said that if I gave him a cheque it would answer\r\n as well. I gave him a cheque for £20 and nine sovereigns. When I was\r\n going away I do not remember that he said anything about my paying the\r\n money to Pratt and Padwick. He said on parting, ‘When you have settled\r\n this account write down word to either me or Cook.’ I turned round\r\n and said, ‘I shall certainly write to Mr. Cook.’ I said so because I\r\n thought I was settling Mr. Cook’s account. He said, ‘It don’t much\r\n matter which you write to.’ I said, ‘If I address Mr. Cook, Rugeley,\r\n Stafford, it will be correct, will it not?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ After\r\n leaving Beaufort Buildings I went to Tattersall’s. I then received all\r\n the money I expected, except £110 from Mr. Morris, who paid me £90\r\n instead of £200. I sent from Tattersall’s a cheque for £450 to Mr.\r\n Pratt. I posted a letter to Cook from Tattersall’s, and directed it\r\n to Rugeley. On Tuesday the 20th, next day, I received a telegraphic\r\n message. I have not got it here. I gave it to Captain Hatton at the\r\n coroner’s inquest at Rugeley. In consequence of receiving that message\r\n I wrote again to Cook that day. I addressed my letter as before, but\r\n I believe the letter was not posted till the Wednesday. I have three\r\n bills of exchange with me. I know Palmer’s handwriting, but never saw\r\n him write. I cannot prove his writing; but I knew Cook’s writing, and\r\n I believe the drawing of two and the accepting of the three bills to\r\n be in his writing. I got them from Fisher and gave him cash for them.”\r\n [The witness Boycott was recalled, and identified the signatures on\r\n the bills as those of Palmer and Cook.]\r\n\r\n _Examination continued._—“The bills are each for £200. One of them\r\n was payable in a month, and when it fell due on October 18, Cook paid\r\n the £100 on account. He paid me the remaining £100 at Shrewsbury, but\r\n I cannot tell with certainty on what day. I did not pay the £350 to\r\n Padwick. I hold another bill for £500.” [Thomas Strawbridge, manager\r\n of the bank at Rugeley, identified the drawing and endorsing as in the\r\n handwriting of Palmer. The acceptance, purporting to be in the writing\r\n of Mrs. Sarah Palmer, he did not believe to have been written by her.]\r\n\r\n _Examination continued._—“I am sure that the endorsement on the £500\r\n bill is in Cook’s writing. I got the bill from Mr. Fisher. I paid\r\n £200 on account of it to Palmer, and £275 to Mr. Fisher. The balance\r\n was discount. It was not paid at maturity. I have taken proceedings\r\n against Palmer to recover the amount.”\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November, the _post-mortem_ examination was held, at\r\nwhich Palmer was present, and the incidents of the pushing of the jar\r\ncontaining the contents of the stomach and the cutting of its coverings\r\noccurred; and if the evidence of _Myatt_, the postboy, is to be taken\r\nas true, Palmer tried to bribe him to upset the fly in which Mr.\r\nStevens and his solicitor’s clerk were to take the jar to the Stafford\r\nstation, _en route_ to London,\r\n\r\n _James Myatt, examined by Mr. James._—“In November last I was\r\n postboy at the ‘Talbot Arms,’ Rugeley. I know Palmer, the prisoner,\r\n and I remember Monday, the 26th of November last. I was ordered on\r\n that night, a little after five o’clock, to take Mr. Stevens to the\r\n Stafford station in a fly. Before I started I went home to get my tea,\r\n and on returning from my tea to the ‘Talbot Arms’ I met the prisoner.\r\n He asked me if I was going to drive Mr. Stevens to Stafford. I told\r\n him I was.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What did he say to you then?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“He asked me if I would upset them.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Them? Had anything been said about a jar?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“He said he supposed I was going to take the jar.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What did you say then?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I said I believed I was.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What did he say after that?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“He said—‘Do you think you could upset them?’”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What answer did you make?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I told him ‘No.’”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Did he say anything more?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“He said—‘If you could, there’s a £10 note for you.’”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What did you say to that?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I told him I could not. I then said, ‘I must go, the\r\n horses are in the fly ready for us to start.’ I do not recollect\r\n that he said anything more about the jar. I said, that if I didn’t\r\n go somebody else would go. He told me not to be in a hurry, for if\r\n anybody else went he would pay me. I saw him again next morning, when\r\n I was going to breakfast. He asked me then who went with the fly. I\r\n told him Mr. Stevens, and, I believed, one of Mr. Gardner’s clerks.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee._—“Were not the words that\r\n Palmer used—‘I wouldn’t mind giving £10 to break Stevens’s neck?’”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I don’t recollect the words ‘break his neck.’”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Well, ‘upset him.’ Did he say, ‘I wouldn’t mind giving\r\n £10 to upset him?’”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes; I believe those were the words. I do not know that\r\n Palmer appeared to have been drinking. I don’t recollect that he had.\r\n I can’t say that he used any epithet, applied to Stevens—he said it\r\n was a humbugging concern altogether, or something of that. I don’t\r\n recollect that he said Stevens was a troublesome fellow, and very\r\n inquisitive. I don’t remember anything more than I have said. I do not\r\n know whether there was more than one jar.”\r\n\r\nWhilst the analysis of the contents of the jar was being conducted\r\nin London, the coroner opened an inquest at Rugeley. Palmer, now\r\nfully aware of his danger, determined to use his influence over the\r\npostmaster to get the earliest information of the results of the\r\nanalysis, and to make a friend of Ward, the coroner. With the latter\r\nobject, he sent a hamper of fish and game to the coroner from London on\r\nthe 1st of December, writing the direction himself, but not otherwise\r\nletting Ward know from whom they came, which he professed to wish to be\r\nkept secret. To Cheshire, the postmaster, with whom he had long been\r\non very friendly terms, receiving from him his mother’s and Cook’s\r\nletters, on the 2nd of December he hinted the importance of his knowing\r\nanything that might pass through the post between Dr. Taylor and the\r\nlocal solicitor. In consequence, on the Wednesday following, he is told\r\nby Cheshire the substance of the letter, already quoted, written by\r\nthe analyst to Mr. Gardner on the previous day. On this Palmer, on the\r\n8th, writes to a poulterer at Stafford to have some game ready for his\r\nmessenger, and sends Bate over for it, to take it, with the following\r\nnote, to the coroner:—\r\n\r\n “MY DEAR SIR,—I am sorry to tell you that I am still confined to my\r\n bed. I don’t think it was mentioned at the inquest yesterday that Cook\r\n was taken ill on Sunday and Monday night, in the same way as he was\r\n on the Tuesday, when he died. The chambermaid at the ‘Crown’ Hotel\r\n (Masters’s) can prove this. I also believe that a man by the name of\r\n Fisher is coming down to prove he received some money at Shrewsbury.\r\n Now, here he could only pay Smith £10 out of £41 he owed him. Had you\r\n not better call Smith to prove this? And, again, whatever Professor\r\n Taylor may say to-morrow, he wrote from London last Tuesday night\r\n to Gardner to say, ‘We (and Dr. Rees) have this day finished our\r\n analysis, and find no traces of either strychnia, prussic acid, or\r\n opium.’ What can beat this from a man like Taylor, if he says what\r\n he has already said, and Dr. Harlands’s evidence? Mind you, I know\r\n and saw it in black and white what Taylor said to Gardner; but this\r\n is strictly private and confidential, but it is true. As regards his\r\n betting-book, I know nothing of it, and it is of no good to anyone. I\r\n hope the verdict to-morrow will be that he died of natural causes, and\r\n thus end it.\r\n\r\n  “Ever yours,       “W. P.”\r\n\r\nBate goes to the poulterer, re-directs, and sends the game by a lad,\r\nand then finds his way to the inn, where the coroner is smoking, calls\r\nhim out of the billiard-room, and privately gives him the letter.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of December the adjourned inquest is to be held, and Dr.\r\nTaylor’s evidence taken. On the previous day, therefore, Bate is again\r\nsummoned by Palmer, and sent to borrow a £5 note of Thirlby, and on\r\nhis return, Palmer being still ill in bed, is told by him to look in a\r\ndrawer for another, but can only find one for £50. At this juncture the\r\nsheriff’s officer arrives to arrest him on one of the overdue bills,\r\nBate is sent out of the room, and on his return commissioned to take\r\na note to the coroner, and to be sure that no one sees him deliver\r\nit. This he succeeds in doing between the “station” and the “Junction\r\nHotel,” where he slips it slily into Ward’s hand. Not liking all this\r\nsecrecy, Bate had hesitated at accepting the mission, and asked that\r\nsome one else should be sent, when Palmer replied, “Why, George, as to\r\nthis poor fellow Cook, he was the best pal I ever had in my life; and\r\nwhy should I have poisoned him?” and then added, “I am as innocent as\r\nyou, George.” The inquest proceeded, and in addition to the evidence\r\nof the symptoms attendant on Cook’s death, Dr. Taylor gave his, and\r\nRoberts proved the purchase of strychnia only a day before Cook’s\r\ndeath. Palmer was summoned, but professed to be too ill to come, and\r\non the next day a verdict of wilful murder against him was returned,\r\nand a warrant issued for his transfer to Stafford jail. After a few\r\ndays’ detention in his own house, Palmer was conveyed to jail, in\r\nsuch a state of despondency that he appears to have determined to\r\nstarve himself to death, and would probably have done so, but for the\r\nthreat of compulsory measures by the Governor. Soon afterwards all his\r\nproperty was seized under a bill of sale and sold, his racehorses alone\r\nrealising four thousand guineas.[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Serjeant Shee’s address to the jury in the defence of the\r\nprisoner, which occupied, without wearying, the attention of the\r\nCourt during eight hours on the seventh day, only a brief analysis\r\ncan be given. The main points on which he insisted were—_First_, the\r\nerroneous nature of the medico-scientific evidence in referring the\r\nsymptoms exhibited in Cook’s case to _tetanus_ from _strychnia_, on\r\nwhich he was prepared to contradict it by witnesses of equal character\r\nand credit in the profession. _Secondly_, the probability, amounting as\r\nnear as possible to a certainty, that if the death had been occasioned\r\nby strychnia, the presence of that poison should have been detected\r\nby the analysts. _Thirdly_, the similarity of the symptoms in the\r\ncase to those of cases of _traumatic_ or _idiopathic tetanus_ of late\r\noccurrence, to be described by the doctors who had attended them. As\r\nthe mass of evidence by which he sought to support these propositions\r\nhas been already reported, it is needless to recur to it. We may\r\ntherefore pass on to the moral evidence, only pausing to extract the\r\nnoble passage descriptive of the mechanism of the human frame, with\r\nwhich he introduced the former subject, and his picture of Cook’s state\r\nof mind from before his victory at Shrewsbury until his death.\r\n\r\n “‘A little learning is a dangerous thing.’\r\n\r\n “It appears to me there never was a case in which the adage was so\r\n applicable as it is in this. Of all the works of God, the one best\r\n calculated to fill us with wonder and admiration, and convince us of\r\n our dependence on our Maker, and the utter nothingness of ourselves,\r\n is the mortal coil in which we live, and breathe, and think, and\r\n have our being. Every minute of our lives, functions are performed\r\n at our will, the unerring accuracy of which nothing but omniscience\r\n and omnipotence could have secured. We feel and see exactly what\r\n takes place, and yet the moment we attempt to explain what takes\r\n place, the instant we endeavour to get a reason for what we know, and\r\n see, and do, the mystery of creation—‘God created man in his own\r\n image, in the image of God created he them’—arrests our course, and\r\n we are flung back on conjecture and doubt. We know in a sense—we\r\n suppose—that the soft medullary substance which is within the cavity\r\n of the head is the seat of thought, of sensation, and of will. We\r\n know that that soft medullary substance is continued down the middle\r\n of the back, protected by a bony duct or canal, within which it lies\r\n embedded, and we know that from the sides of that bony duct and\r\n from this medullary substance proceed an infinite variety of nerves\r\n (the conduits of sensation from all parts of the body to the soul)\r\n and of muscles connected and dependent on them, the instruments of\r\n voluntary motion. This we know; and we know that by that process all\r\n the ordinary actions of ourselves, at our will, are effected with the\r\n most wonderful precision. Sometimes, however, these nerves and muscles\r\n depart from their normal character, and instead of being the mere\r\n instruments of the soul, become irregular, convulsive, tumultuary,\r\n vindicating to themselves a sort of independent vitality, totally\r\n regardless of the authority to which they are ordinarily subject. When\r\n thrown into this state of excitement, their effects are known by the\r\n general name of convulsions. It is remarkable, unlike most other fine\r\n names, they are not of modern adaptation. The ancients had them to\r\n express the very same thing. The spasmodic and tetanic affections were\r\n known then, and as much about them hundreds and thousands of years ago\r\n as is known now. Tetanic convulsions have been divided in later times\r\n into two specific branches of tetanus—idiopathic and traumatic.”\r\n\r\nIn opening the portion of his case that Cook’s death was attributable\r\nto causes other than strychnia, Serjeant Shee adroitly concealed the\r\nnames of the diseases to which his witnesses were prepared to attribute\r\nit. Until, therefore, his cloud of witnesses had been passed through,\r\nthe prosecution did not know, except from the _cross-examination_ of\r\ntheir own medico-scientific witnesses, to what technical points they\r\nhad to shape their reply.\r\n\r\nIn support of his contention that Cook’s death could be fairly\r\nattributed to ordinary convulsions, the learned Serjeant gave the\r\nfollowing graphic sketch of the state of his mind at the period of\r\nShrewsbury races, and from then to his death:—\r\n\r\n “He went there in the imminent peril of returning from them a ruined\r\n man. His stepfather assured Palmer that there would not be 4000\r\n shillings for those who had claims on his estate. From the necessity\r\n he was under of raising money at an enormous discount we may easily\r\n infer that he was in desperate difficulties, and that unless some\r\n sudden success on the turf should retrieve his fortunes, they were\r\n hopeless. His health was shattered, his mind distracted; he had long\r\n been cherishing hopes that Polestar would win, and so put him in\r\n possession of something like a thousand guineas. The mare, it was\r\n true, was hardly his own, for she had been mortgaged; and if she\r\n should lose, she would become the property of another person. Picture\r\n to yourselves what must have been the condition, mental and bodily,\r\n of that young man when he rose from his bed on the morning of the\r\n races. It is scarcely possible, as he went down to breakfast, that\r\n this thought must not have crossed his mind, ‘My fate is trembling\r\n in the balance; this is the crisis of my destiny. Unless my horse\r\n shall win, to-night I am a beggar.’ With these feelings he repairs to\r\n the course. Another race is run before Polestar is brought out. His\r\n impatience is extreme. He looks on in a state of agonising excitement.\r\n Will the minutes never fly? At last arrives the decisive moment; the\r\n time has come for his race. The flag is dropped; the horses start;\r\n his mare wins easily, and he, her master, has won a thousand guineas!\r\n For three minutes he is not able to speak, so intense is his emotion.\r\n Slowly he recovers his utterance, and then how rapturous is his joy!\r\n He is saved, he is saved! Another chance to retrieve his position—one\r\n chance more to recover his character! As yet, at all events, he will\r\n not be a disgrace to his family and his friends. Conceive him to be,\r\n with all his faults, an honourable young man, and you may easily\r\n imagine what his ecstasy must have been. He loves the memory of his\r\n dead mother—he still reverences the name of his father—he is jealous\r\n of his sister’s honour, and it may be that he cherishes silently in\r\n his heart the thought of some other being dearer still than all to\r\n whom the story of his ruin would bring bitter anguish. But he is not\r\n ruined; he will meet his engagements like an honourable man. There is\r\n now no danger of his being an outcast, an adventurer, a black-leg.\r\n He will live to redeem his position, and to give joy to those who\r\n love him. With such thoughts in his heart, he returns to his inn in a\r\n state of indescribable elation, and with a revulsion from despair that\r\n must have convulsed—though not in the sense of illness—every fibre\r\n of his frame. His first idea is to entertain his friends, and he does\r\n so. The evidence does not prove that he drank to excess, but he gave a\r\n champagne dinner; and we all know that is a luxurious entertainment,\r\n at which there is no stint and not much self-respect. That evening he\r\n did not spend in the society of Palmer; indeed, it is not clear in\r\n whose company he spent it. But we find him on the evening of Wednesday\r\n at the ‘Unicorn’ with Saunders, his trainer, and a lady. On Thursday\r\n he walks upon the course, and Herring remonstrates with him for doing\r\n so, as the day is damp and misty, and the ground wet. That night he\r\n is seized with illness, and he continues ailing until his death at\r\n Rugeley. Arrived at Rugeley, it is but natural to suppose that a\r\n reaction of feeling may have set in. Then the dark side of the picture\r\n may have presented itself to his imagination. The chilling thought\r\n may have come upon him that his winnings were already forestalled\r\n and would scarcely suffice to save him from destruction. It is\r\n when suffering from a weakened body, and an irritated and excited\r\n mind, that he is attacked by a sickness which clings to his system,\r\n leaves him without any rest, incapacitates him from taking food,\r\n distracts his nerves, and places him in imminent danger of falling\r\n a victim to any sudden attack of convulsions to which he may have a\r\n predisposition. He relished no society so much as that of Palmer,\r\n whose residence was immediately opposite the ‘Talbot Arms’ Inn, where\r\n he was lying on his sick bed. For two days he had been taking opiate\r\n pills prescribed by Dr. Bamford. On Sunday night, at twelve o’clock,\r\n he started as from a dream in a state of the utmost excitement and\r\n alarm. He admitted afterwards that for two minutes he was mad, but he\r\n could not ascribe it to anything unless to his having been awakened\r\n by a squabble in the street. But do no such things happen to people\r\n of sound constitutions and regular habits? Do no such people awaken\r\n in agony and delirium because there is a noise under their windows?\r\n No; these are the afflictions of the dissipated and anxious, whose\r\n bodies are shattered and whose minds are distracted. Next day,\r\n Monday, he was pretty well, but not so well as to mount his horse or\r\n to take a walk in the fields. He could converse with his trainer and\r\n jockey, but he could take no substantial food, and drank not a drop\r\n of brandy-and-water. You will bear in mind that Palmer was not with\r\n him that day. In the middle of the night he was seized with an attack\r\n similar in character to that of the night preceding, but manifestly\r\n much milder, for he retained his consciousness throughout it, and was\r\n not mad for a moment. The evidence of Elizabeth Mills is conclusive\r\n on the point. At three o’clock on the following day (Tuesday) Mr.\r\n Jones, the surgeon of Lutterworth, arrived, and spent a considerable\r\n time—probably from three to seven o’clock—in his company. They had\r\n abundant opportunity for conversing confidentially, and they were\r\n likely to have done so, for they were very intimate, and Jones appears\r\n to have been on more familiar terms with Cook than was any other\r\n person, not even excepting Mr. Stevens. Nothing occurred in the entire\r\n and unbounded confidence which must have existed between Mr. Cook and\r\n Mr. Jones, to raise any suspicions in the mind of Mr. Jones; and at\r\n the consultation, which took place between seven and eight o’clock on\r\n Tuesday evening between Jones, Palmer, and Bamford, as to what the\r\n medicine for that evening should be, the fit of the Monday night was\r\n not mentioned. That is a remarkable fact. The Crown may say that it\r\n is remarkable, inasmuch as Palmer knew it, and said not a word about\r\n it; but I think that it shows that the fit was so little serious in\r\n the opinion of Cook that he did not think it worth mentioning to his\r\n intimate friend.”\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the “moral evidence,” counsel _first_ attacked the\r\nmotive imputed by the prosecution, and sought to show from the\r\ncorrespondence, as well as from the conduct of the parties, that at\r\nthe moment when Palmer was charged with killing Cook, he was his best\r\nand indeed the only friend whom he could look to to assist him in his\r\nsevere financial troubles.\r\n\r\n “Was it,” he said, “to his interest that in the second week in\r\n November Cook should be killed, say by a railway accident? For some\r\n time they had been mixed up together in racing transactions, had made\r\n heavy losses during the late sporting season, and Cook at least—and\r\n most probably Palmer, as associated with him—was looking forward to\r\n the success of Polestar to save them from ruin. At that time Pratt,\r\n the bill discounter, was pressing for an extra £200 to stave off legal\r\n proceedings on the £2000 bill, to which his mother’s name had been\r\n forged. To whom does Palmer apply? To Cook, who at once writes to his\r\n betting agent Fisher to advance and pay that to Pratt on the Saturday\r\n before the Monday’s settlement at Tattersall’s of the Shrewsbury\r\n winnings. Fisher having done this, was it not probable that Cook\r\n arranged with Palmer, that in order to get the use of this £200 for\r\n a few days, Herring, and not Fisher, should be authorised to collect\r\n the winnings and secure a sufficient payment to Pratt to stave off\r\n the action?” [Cook’s letter of the 19th of November was accordingly\r\n cited as a proof of his anxiety to assist Palmer.] “Again, there was\r\n in Herring’s hands a bill of Palmer’s for £500, bearing his mother’s\r\n forged acceptance. Was it likely that with this danger staring him\r\n in the face, Palmer would kill the only man from whom he could look\r\n for money? The transaction as to the bill for £500, secured on Cook’s\r\n racehorses, discounted by Pratt, for which, as Pratt wrote him at\r\n once, Palmer would have to provide, was another reason for not killing\r\n his only friend.”\r\n\r\nIn September Palmer had negotiated this bill with Pratt professedly for\r\nCook’s benefit, and had received from Pratt a crossed cheque to Cook’s\r\norder for £385, and a wine warrant for £65, and at the same time, on\r\nhis own account, £315 in cash, and the imputation by the Crown was that\r\nhe forged Cook’s endorsement and took the money. The improbability of\r\nhis doing this, as Cook was certain, had he done so, to have complained\r\nof it during the months that elapsed between the giving of the bill of\r\nsale on his horses and his death, was urged by Mr. Shee, who ventured\r\nto offer as an explanation the suggestion that as Cook wanted cash\r\non that day, Palmer gave him his £315, and with his consent endorsed\r\nCook’s name on the cheque and paid that to his own account. Again he\r\ndealt with the circumstance of Cook’s cheque for £350, the body of\r\nwhich was drawn by Cheshire, and, as Palmer said, taken by him on the\r\n20th November to Cook for him to sign in his sick room. That cheque, it\r\nwill be remembered, was not produced, but\r\n\r\n “Weatherby, on whom it was drawn,” said Serjeant Shee, “was under the\r\n impression that the signature was Cook’s.[66] As it was not certain\r\n that Frail would have sent up to Weatherby the stakes against which\r\n it was drawn by the Monday, was it likely that, had Palmer meditated\r\n Cook’s death at the time, he would have risked its being returned—as\r\n it was—and passing into the hands of Cook’s executors, who would be\r\n certain to enquire into the matter, on Cook’s sudden death? From the\r\n enquiries that had been instituted as to his brother’s life policy,\r\n he knew himself to be an object of suspicion, and, if any foul play\r\n happened to Cook, all hope of recovering that would be gone. ‘Their\r\n refusal,’ wrote Pratt to him, ‘altered the whole state of affairs, and\r\n Palmer must be prepared to pay his mother’s acceptances for £4,000\r\n due at the end of the month.’ There was the pinch; the office would\r\n not pay; the £4,000 was becoming due; the holder of the bills saw\r\n that he was without security, and, if anything occurred to increase\r\n the suspicions of the insurance office, which was very reluctant to\r\n pay, the £13,000 was lost for ever, lost beyond hope. Gentlemen, that\r\n £13,000 is sure to be paid, unless this man is convicted of murder;\r\n and that has a great deal to do with the clamour and alarm which\r\n have been excited. So sure as that man is saved, and saved I believe\r\n he will be, that £13,000 is paid. There is no defence, no pretence\r\n for a defence—the letters of the office make that plain. They took\r\n an enormous premium; knowing that the man was only 30, they took a\r\n premium for a man of 50—at least, the letters show that the premium\r\n was enormous—and I say that, as sure as this man is saved, that\r\n £13,000 is good for him, and will pay his creditors. Do not these\r\n facts show that in this October suspicions were hanging in menacing\r\n meteors about Palmer’s head, which would come down with irresistible\r\n momentum and crush him upon suspicion of a sudden death by murder? Do\r\n you believe that a man who wrote what the effects of strychnia were\r\n in his manual would risk such a scene as a death-bed by it, in the\r\n presence of the dearest and best friend of Cook—a man whom he could\r\n not influence; a medical man, who liked him and loved him well enough\r\n when he knew he was ill to sleep in the same room with him, that he\r\n might be able to attend to him in case he wanted assistance during the\r\n night? Is that common sense? Are you going to endorse such a theory as\r\n that upon the suggestion of Dr. Taylor about the effects of strychnia\r\n produced upon his five rabbits? Impossible! perfectly impossible! as\r\n I submit to you. So sure as anything happened by foul play to Cook,\r\n he had no more chance of getting the £13,000 than the £180,000 from\r\n the Prince of Wales Insurance Office—none whatever. That was the\r\n only means he had at that time of extricating himself from these\r\n encumbrances.”\r\n\r\nAgain, he tried to depreciate the evidence of Mills as to the symptoms\r\nof Cook’s attacks, on the ground—not, indeed, that she had been\r\ntampered with by the prosecution—because then, he said, he was certain\r\nthat she would not have been called—but “that she had been instructed\r\nin the various symptoms by the repeated private examinations to which\r\nshe had been subjected,” dwelling on the omission from her evidence\r\nbefore the coroner that she had been so violently sick after tasting\r\nthe broth, and on the other discrepancies in, and omissions from, her\r\ndescription of the symptoms when there, and when in court.\r\n\r\n “Upon all occasions,” said the learned counsel, “I am most\r\n reluctant to attack a witness who is examined on his or her oath,\r\n and particularly if he be in a humble position of life. I am very\r\n reluctant to impute perjury to such a person; and I think that a man\r\n who has been as long in the profession as I have been must be put a\r\n little to his wits’ end when he rushes upon the assumption that a\r\n person whose statements have, after a considerable lapse of time,\r\n materially varied, is, therefore, necessarily, deliberately perjured.\r\n The truth is, we know perfectly well, that if a considerable interval\r\n of time occurs between the first story and the second, and if the\r\n intelligent and respectable persons who are anxious to investigate the\r\n truth, but who have still a strong moral conviction—upon imperfect\r\n information—of the guilt of the accused person, will talk to\r\n witnesses and say, ‘Was there anything of this kind?’ or, ‘Anything\r\n of that kind?’ the witnesses at last catch hold of the phrase or term\r\n which has so often been used to them, and having in that way adopted\r\n it, they fancy they may tell it in court.”\r\n\r\nHe also attacked the conduct of Mr. Stevens, the stepfather, for, as\r\nhe said, “goading and irritating Palmer into incautious expressions,\r\nby insinuating that he had stolen a trumpery betting-book that could\r\nnot be of use to anyone;” and attributed Palmer’s anxiety to nominate\r\na local solicitor to manage affairs to the nature of the pecuniary\r\ntransactions, so much relying on honour, making them far more easy of\r\nadjustment by a friendly than by a hostile agent. As for Myatt, the\r\npostboy’s, story of the bribe for upsetting the fly, he attributed\r\nthat to a personal feeling against the “meddlesome old gentleman,”\r\nas he called Stevens, and not to any idea of destroying the probable\r\nproofs of his delinquency. His marked attention to Cook during his\r\nillness he attributed to the interest he necessarily felt in his life,\r\nand the sending of broth and other things from his own house to the\r\nwish to save expense at a time when neither of them were too well off.\r\n“Would he,” said Serjeant Shee, “dream of sending poisoned broth to an\r\ninn, where it was sure to be tasted by the cook?”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the scientific witnesses which he would call to rebut\r\nthose of the prosecution’s, he would prove that Cook, previously to\r\nthe Shrewsbury meeting, was suffering severely from a syphilitic\r\nstate of throat, and applying to Palmer for remedies for it—that\r\nPalmer could not have been in Rugeley at the time at which Newton\r\nswore that he sold the strychnia to him, and that the incident at\r\nthe “Raven,” at Shrewsbury, of the brandy-and-water was a fiction.\r\nTo what this evidence of previous illness amounted, and how the two\r\nwitnesses who were to negative Newton and disprove the scene at the\r\n“Raven” fared when put in the box, will be seen in the report of\r\ntheir examination.[67] Great stress was of course laid on Palmer’s\r\nnot only calling in Dr. Bamford, but sending for Mr. Jones, Cook’s\r\nfirmest friend, to witness what proved his last day of life, and on\r\nthe improbability of Palmer tampering with the medicines under such\r\nprofessional supervision.\r\n\r\n “Is it conceivable that if Palmer meant to slay Cook with poison in\r\n the dead of night, he would previously have insured the presence\r\n in his victim’s chamber of a medical witness, who would know from\r\n his frightful symptoms that the man was not dying a natural death?\r\n He brings a medical man into his room, and makes him lie within a\r\n few inches of the sick man’s bed, that he may be startled with his\r\n terriffic shrieks, and gaze on those agonizing convulsions which\r\n indicate the fatal potency of the poison. Can you believe it? He might\r\n have dispatched him by means that defy detection, for Cook was taking\r\n morphia medicinally, and a grain or two more would have silently\r\n thrown him into an eternal sleep;[68] but instead of this he sends to\r\n Lutterworth for Jones. You have been told that this was done to cover\r\n appearances. Done to cover appearances! No, no, no! You cannot believe\r\n it. It is not in human nature. It cannot be true. _You cannot find him\r\n guilty. You dare not find him guilty on the supposition of its truth.\r\n The country will not stand by you if you believe it to be true. You\r\n will be impeached before the whole world if you say that it is true. I\r\n believe in my conscience it is false, because, consistently with the\r\n laws that govern human nature, it cannot be true._”\r\n\r\n“The incident of his being found searching the clothes and under the\r\npillow,” said counsel, “ought not to be looked upon as suspicious, as\r\nMills, who came into the room at the time, thought no suspicion of\r\nit, and there was nothing but the evidence of a kind and considerate\r\ncharacter in his having ordered the shell and the coffin; nor was\r\nit possible to torture into a presumption of guilt the few words\r\nof irritation which may have fallen from him in the course of a\r\nconversation in which Mr. Stevens treated him with scorn, not to say\r\nwith insolence.” And then, alluding to the entry as to the effects of\r\nstrychnia in one of his medical books, the learned Serjeant turned\r\nit most adroitly to his own purpose, as the basis of a peroration so\r\ntelling in its language and perfect in its construction that it must be\r\npreserved intact.\r\n\r\n “The Crown had, no doubt, originally intended to rely upon the\r\n prisoner’s medical books as affording damning proof of his guilt; but\r\n I will refer to those volumes for evidences that will speak eloquently\r\n in his favour. In youth and early manhood there is no such protection\r\n for a man as the society of an innocent and virtuous woman to whom\r\n he is sincerely attached. If you find a young man devoted to such a\r\n woman, loving her dearly, and marrying her for the love he bears her,\r\n you may depend upon it that he is a man of humane and gentle nature,\r\n little prone to deeds of violence. To such a woman was Palmer attached\r\n in his youth, and I will bring you proof positive to show that the\r\n volumes cited against him were the books he used when a student, and\r\n that the manuscript passages are in the handwriting of his wife. His\r\n was a marriage of the heart. He loved that young and virtuous woman\r\n with a pure and generous affection; he loved her as he now loves\r\n her first-born, who awaits with trembling anxiety the verdict that\r\n will restore him to the arms of his father, or drive that father to\r\n an ignominious death upon the scaffold.” [The prisoner here covered\r\n his face with his hands and shed tears.] “Here in this book I have\r\n conclusive evidence of the kind of man that Palmer was seven years\r\n ago. I find in its pages the copy of a letter addressed by him while\r\n still a student to the woman whom he afterwards made his wife. It is\r\n as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n “‘MY DEAREST ANNIE,—I snatch a moment from my studies to your dear,\r\n dear little self. I need scarcely say that the principal inducement I\r\n have to work is the desire of getting my studies finished, so as to be\r\n able to press your dear little form in my arms. With best, best love,\r\n believe me, dearest Annie,\r\n\r\n  ‘Your own WILLIAM.’\r\n\r\n\r\n “Now this is not the sort of letter that is generally read in courts\r\n of justice. It was no part of my instructions to read that letter, but\r\n the book was put in to prove that this man is a wicked, heartless,\r\n savage desperado; and I show you what he was seven years ago—that he\r\n was a man who loved a young woman for her own sake—loved her with a\r\n pure and virtuous affection—such an affection as would, in almost all\r\n natures, be a certain antidote against guilt. Such is the man whom it\r\n has been my duty to defend upon this occasion, and upon the evidence\r\n that is before you I cannot believe him to be guilty. Don’t suppose,\r\n gentlemen, that he is unsupported in this dreadful trial by his family\r\n and his friends. An aged mother, who may have disapproved of some\r\n part of his conduct, awaits with trembling anxiety your verdict; a\r\n dear sister can scarcely support herself under the suspense which now\r\n presses upon her; a brave and gallant brother stands by him to defend\r\n him, and spares neither time nor trouble to save him from an awful\r\n doom. I call upon you, gentlemen, to raise your minds to a capacity to\r\n estimate the high duty which you have to perform. You have to stem the\r\n torrent of prejudice; you have to vindicate the honour and character\r\n of your country; you have, with firmness and courage, to do your\r\n duty, and to find a verdict for the Crown if you believe that guilt\r\n is proved; but, if you have a doubt upon that point, depend upon it\r\n that the time will come when the innocence of that man will be made\r\n apparent, and when you will deeply regret any want of due and calm\r\n consideration of the case which it has been my duty to lay before you.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPLY.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the tenth day was occupied with the reply\r\nof the Attorney-General, dealing in the _first_ part with the\r\nmedico-scientific evidence brought forward for the defence, and\r\ncontrasting it with that on the part of the prosecution, and in the\r\n_latter_ part pressing home with all his force of criticism and power\r\nof language the suspicious acts of the prisoner before and after the\r\ndeath of Cook. Between _idiopathic_ and _traumatic tetanus_ he drew\r\nthe distinction, “supported,” as he said, “by the evidence of men who\r\nhad seen, not here and there a stray case, but numerous instances of\r\nthat disease, that the former was a disease of days, and even weeks,\r\nand not of hours or minutes.” He pointed out that such were really the\r\nsymptoms in the cases adduced for the defence, and ridiculed the notion\r\nthat the old ulcers of the spring of the year, with which Dr. Savage\r\nhad dealt successfully, could be assigned as the causes of this form of\r\ndisease in Cook’s case, and then criticised _seriatim_ the other forms\r\nof convulsive disease to which the witnesses for the defence attributed\r\nit. After referring to the statements of Dr. Savage and Mr. Stevens as\r\nto the state of Cook’s health prior to his departure for Shrewsbury\r\nraces, he thus dealt with the evidences of his state of health offered\r\nby the prisoner’s witnesses:—\r\n\r\n “It is said that at some former time he had exhibited his throat to\r\n some of the witnesses that were called, and had applied to Palmer for\r\n mercurial wash to apply to it, or to some of the ulcers. The precise\r\n period is not fixed, but it is perfectly clear that, though at one\r\n time he had adopted that course, under the recommendation of Dr.\r\n Savage he had got rid of it, and there is not the slightest pretence\r\n for saying that this man was suffering under a syphilitic affection\r\n of any kind; that fact was negatived distinctly and unequivocally by\r\n a man of the highest authority, a medical gentleman of eminence,\r\n under whose treatment the man got so rapidly well. It is a pretence,\r\n gentlemen, which has not the shadow of a foundation, and which I\r\n should be shrinking from my duty if I did not denounce as altogether\r\n unworthy of your consideration. There was nothing about the man,\r\n according to the statement of those who were competent to give you an\r\n opinion, which would warrant, for a single moment, the supposition\r\n that there was anything in any part of his body which could justify\r\n the notion of _traumatic tetanus_. Even if there were, the character\r\n which his symptoms assumed when the _tetanus_ set in, is utterly\r\n incompatible, according to the evidence of all the witnesses, with a\r\n case of _traumatic tetanus_.”\r\n\r\nThen, after pointing out how the two cases of this disease put forward\r\nby the defence were cases of days and hours, and, not like Cook’s,\r\nof minutes, he proceeded to deal with the suggestion of _idiopathic\r\ntetanus_.\r\n\r\n “_Idiopathic tetanus?_ Proceeding from what? They say that Mr. Cook\r\n was a man of a delicate constitution, subject to excitement; that\r\n he had something the matter with his chest; that, in addition, he\r\n had this diseased condition of his throat, and, putting all these\r\n things together, they say, that if he took cold, he might get\r\n ‘_idiopathic tetanus_.’ We are launched into a sea of speculation and\r\n impossibilities. Mr. Nunneley, who came forward for the purpose of\r\n inducing you to believe this, goes through a bead-roll of the supposed\r\n infirmities of Mr. Cook; talks about his exciteability, about his\r\n delicacy of chest, about the affection of his throat, goes through\r\n these various heads, and says that these things may have predisposed\r\n him to ‘_idiopathic tetanus_,’ if he took cold. What evidence is\r\n there that he ever did take cold? Not the slightest in the world.\r\n From beginning to end he was never treated for cold by anybody, and\r\n never complained of it to anyone. _I cannot help saying that to me it\r\n seems a scandal upon a learned, distinguished, and liberal profession,\r\n that men should put forward such speculations as these, perverting\r\n facts, and drawing from them sophistical and unwarrantable conclusions\r\n with the view of deceiving a jury. I have the greatest respect for\r\n science, no man can have more; but I cannot repress my indignation\r\n and abhorrence when I see it thus perverted and prostituted to the\r\n purposes of a particular cause in a court of justice._ Do not talk\r\n to me about excitement, as Mr. Nunneley did the other day, being the\r\n cause of _idiopathic tetanus_. You remember the sort of excitement\r\n he spoke of, they are unworthy of your notice, and they were topics\r\n discreditable to be put forward by a witness as worthy of the\r\n attention of sensible men constituting such a tribunal as you are.”\r\n\r\nAgain, on Mr. Nunneley’s suggestion that it might be a case of\r\ngeneral convulsions accompanied by tetanic symptoms, said the\r\nAttorney-General.—\r\n\r\n “Well, but pause a moment, Mr. Nunneley; have you ever seen one single\r\n case in which death arising from general convulsions, accompanied by\r\n tetanic symptoms, has not ended in the unconsciousness of the patient\r\n before death? ‘No, I never knew such a case—not one. But in some book\r\n or other I am told that there is such a case reported;’ and he cites\r\n one, not for that purpose, I think, but with reference, to general\r\n convulsions being sometimes accompanied by tetanic symptoms and ending\r\n in death, from a very eminent author of the present day, Dr. Copland.\r\n Dr. Copland is living and Dr. Copland might have been called—was not\r\n called, notwithstanding the challenge which I threw out. Why? Because\r\n it is infinitely better in such a case to call together from the east\r\n and west practitioners of more or less obscurity, instead of bringing\r\n to bear upon the subject the light of science which is treasured in\r\n the breasts of the eminent practitioners with which this city abounds.”\r\n\r\nAgain, on Mr. Partridge’s evidence of the probable effect of the\r\ngranules on the spinal marrow,\r\n\r\n “I called his attention,” he said, “to what had evidently not been\r\n done before, namely, the symptoms of Mr. Cook’s case, and asked him\r\n in simple, straightforward terms whether, looking at these, he would\r\n pledge his opinion, in the face of the medical world and the Court,\r\n that this was a case of arachnitis, and he candidly admitted that he\r\n would not assert it.”\r\n\r\nAgainst Dr. Macdonald’s epileptic convulsions with tetanic\r\ncomplications, he cited the following from that gentleman’s\r\ncross-examination:—\r\n\r\n “Did you ever know a case of epilepsy, with or without tetanic\r\n complications, in which consciousness was not destroyed before the\r\n patient died? He said ‘No, I cannot say I ever did, but I have read in\r\n some book that such a case occurred.’ Is there anything to make you\r\n think this was epilepsy? ‘Well, it may have been epilepsy, because I\r\n do not know what else to ascribe it to, but I must admit that epilepsy\r\n is characterised generally by unconsciousness.’ Well, then, what\r\n difference would tetanic complications make? That he is unable to\r\n explain.”\r\n\r\nWith the final suggestion of _Angina pectoris_, he could not deal so\r\nminutely as with the four preceding ones.\r\n\r\n “The gentleman,” he said, “who was called at the last moment would\r\n not have escaped quite so easily if I had had the books to which he\r\n referred under my hand, and been able to expose, as I would have done,\r\n the ignorance or presumption of the assertion he dared to make. _I say\r\n ignorance or presumption; or, what is worse, an intention to deceive.\r\n I assert it in the face of the whole medical profession, and I am\r\n satisfied I shall have a verdict in my favour._”\r\n\r\nHe then concluded this part of his speech by calling attention to the\r\nfact, that three of the witnesses for the prisoner, Mr. Partridge,\r\nDr. Robinson, and even Dr. Letheby, strongly as he was biased for the\r\ndefence, agreed with Sir B. Brodie and the other medical witnesses\r\nfor the Crown, that, “in the whole of their experience, learning, and\r\ninformation, they knew of no known disease to which the symptoms of Mr.\r\nCook could possibly be referred—a fact the importance of which it was\r\nimpossible to exaggerate.”\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that all were agreed, that from the time that the final\r\nparoxysm set in, the symptoms were similar to those of _strychnia\r\ntetanus_, he dealt with the point which the defence had raised—which\r\nhe admitted deserved their most attentive consideration—that there\r\nwere points of difference, which had led some of the witnesses to the\r\nconclusion that they could not have resulted from that cause.\r\n\r\n “Let us see,” he said, “what they are. In the first place, they showed\r\n that the period which elapsed between the supposed administration of\r\n the poison, and the first symptoms, was longer than they have ever\r\n observed in animals upon which they have experimented. The first\r\n observation which arises is this: that there is a known difference\r\n between animal and human life, in the power with which certain\r\n specific things act upon their organization. It may well be that\r\n poison administered to a rabbit will produce its effect in a given\r\n time. It by no means follows that it will produce the same effect in\r\n the same time on an animal of a different description. Still less does\r\n it follow that it will exercise its baneful influence in the same time\r\n on a human subject. The whole of the evidence on both sides leads\r\n to establish this fact, that not only in individuals of different\r\n species, but in individuals of the same species, the same poison and\r\n the same influence will produce effects different in degree, different\r\n in duration, different in power. But again, it is perfectly notorious\r\n that the rapidity with which the poison begins to work depends mainly\r\n upon the mode of its administration. If it is administered in a fluid\r\n state it acts with great rapidity. If it is given in a solid state its\r\n effects come on more slowly. If it is given in an indurated substance\r\n it will act with still greater tardiness. Then what was the period at\r\n which this poison began to act after its administration, assuming it\r\n to have been poison? It seems, from Mr. Jones’s statement, that Palmer\r\n came to administer the pills somewhere about 11 o’clock, but they were\r\n not administered on his first arrival, for the patient, as if with an\r\n intuitive sense of the death that awaited him, strongly resisted the\r\n attempts to make him take them; and no doubt these remonstrances, and\r\n the endeavours to overcome them, occupied some period of time. The\r\n pills were at last given. Assuming—which I only do for the sake of\r\n argument—that the pills contained strychnia, how soon did they begin\r\n to operate? Mr. Jones says he went down to his supper, and came back\r\n again about 12 o’clock. Upon his return to the room, after a word\r\n or two of conversation with Cook, he proceeded to undress and go to\r\n bed, and had not been in bed ten minutes before a warning came that\r\n another of the paroxysms was about to take place. The maidservant\r\n puts it still earlier, and it appears that as early as ten minutes\r\n before twelve the first alarm was given, which would make the interval\r\n little more than three-quarters of an hour. When these witnesses tell\r\n us that it would take an hour and a half, or two hours, we see here\r\n another of those exaggerated determinations to see the facts only in\r\n the way that will be most favourable to the prisoner. I find in some\r\n of the experiments that have been made that the duration of time,\r\n before the poison begins to work, has been little, if anything, less\r\n than an hour. In the case of a girl at Glasgow it was stated that it\r\n was three-quarters of an hour before the pills began to work. There\r\n may have been some reason for the pills not taking effect within\r\n a certain period after their administration. It would be easy to\r\n mix them up with substances difficult of solution, or which might\r\n retard their action. I cannot bring myself to believe that if in all\r\n other respects you are perfectly satisfied that the symptoms, the\r\n consequences, the effects, were analogous, and similar in all respects\r\n to those produced by strychnia, you will conclude that in this case\r\n strychnia was not administered, and found your conclusion on the\r\n simple fact that a quarter of an hour more than usual may have elapsed\r\n before the pills operated. But they say the premonitory symptoms were\r\n wanting. They assert that in the case of animals the animal at first\r\n manifests some uneasiness, shrinks, and draws itself into itself, as\r\n it were, and avoids moving; that certain involuntary twitchings about\r\n the head come on, and that there were no such premonitory symptoms\r\n in Cook’s case. I utterly deny the proposition. I say there were\r\n premonitory symptoms of the most marked character. He is lying in\r\n his bed; he suddenly starts up in an agony of alarm. What made him\r\n do that? Was there nothing premonitory there—nothing that warned\r\n him the paroxysm was coming on? He jumps up, says, ‘Go and fetch\r\n Palmer—fetch me help! I am going to be ill as I was last night!’ What\r\n was that but a knowledge that the symptoms of the previous night were\r\n returning, and a warning of what he might expect unless some relief\r\n were obtained? He sits up and prays to have his neck rubbed. What was\r\n the feeling about his neck but a premonitory symptom, which was to\r\n precede the paroxysms that were to supervene? He begs to have his neck\r\n rubbed, and that gives him some comfort. But here they say this could\r\n not have been tetanus from strychnia, because animals cannot bear to\r\n be touched, for a touch brings on a paroxysm—not only a touch, but\r\n a breath of air, a sound, a word, a movement of any one near will\r\n bring on a return of the paroxysm. Now, in three cases of death from\r\n strychnia we have shown that the patient has endured rubbing of the\r\n limbs, and received satisfaction from that rubbing. In Mrs. Smyth’s\r\n case, when her legs were distorted, she prayed and entreated that she\r\n might have them straightened. The lady at Leeds, in the case which Dr.\r\n Nunneley himself attended, implored her husband between the spasms to\r\n rub her legs and arms in order to overcome the rigidity. That case\r\n was within his own knowledge, and yet in spite of it, although he\r\n detected strychnia in the body of the unhappy woman, he dares to say\r\n that Cook’s having tolerated the rubbing between the paroxysms is\r\n a proof that he had not taken strychnia. Then there is the case of\r\n Clutterbuck. He had taken an overdose of strychnia, and suffered from\r\n the reappearance of tetanus, and his only comfort was to have his legs\r\n rubbed. Therefore, I say that the continued endeavour to persuade a\r\n jury that the fact of Cook’s having had his neck rubbed proves that\r\n this is not tetanus by strychnia, shows nothing but the dishonesty and\r\n insincerity of the witnesses who have so dared to pervert the facts.\r\n But they go further, and contend that Cook was able to swallow. So he\r\n was before the paroxysms came on. But nobody has ever pretended that\r\n he could swallow afterwards. He swallowed the pills, and what is very\r\n curious, and illustrates part of the theory, is this, that it was the\r\n act of swallowing the pills, a sort of movement in raising his head,\r\n which brought on the paroxysm of which he died.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus called attention to the fact, that against the three cases\r\nof undoubted poisoning by strychnia (those of Mrs. Smyth, Mrs. Dove,\r\nand Mr. Clutterbuck), the sufferers in which begged to be rubbed, all\r\nthat could be set up was, that animals when thus poisoned could not\r\nbear to be touched, the Attorney-General dealt with the fact of the\r\nrigidity of Cook’s body after death, on which Mr. Nunneley relied as\r\na proof that it could not be a case of strychnia poisoning. He cited\r\nthe evidence of Mr. Herapath, the very next analyst called by the\r\ndefence, that in two of his experiments on animals “the bodies had been\r\nindurated and contorted,” as well that of Dr. Taylor that one of the\r\nanimals in his experiments was so rigid after death that it could be\r\nheld out in an horizontal position in the air as though it were on its\r\nfour legs on a plane surface. “What,” he said, “are you to think of\r\nthe honesty of this sort of evidence? “Again, on the question of the\r\nfulness or emptiness of the heart, he thus accounted for the variation\r\nof the symptoms:—\r\n\r\n “It is obvious to any one who reflects for a single moment that the\r\n question whether the heart shall be found compressed, or the lungs\r\n congested must depend upon the immediate cause of death, and we know\r\n that in cases of tetanus death may result from more than one cause.\r\n All the muscles of the body are subject to the exciting action of\r\n this powerful poison, but no one can tell in what order those muscles\r\n will be affected, or where the poisonous influence will put forth\r\n the fulness of its power. If it acts on the respiratory muscles,\r\n and arrests the play of the lungs, and with it the breathing of the\r\n atmospheric air, the result will be that the heart will be left full.\r\n But if some spasm seizes on the heart, contracting it and expelling\r\n from it the blood that it contains, and so produces death, the result\r\n will be that the heart will be found empty. So that you never have\r\n perfect certainty as to how these symptoms will manifest themselves\r\n after death; but that is again put forward as if the fact of the heart\r\n being empty is a conclusive fact of the death not having taken place\r\n from strychnia. Yet those men who come here as witnesses under the\r\n sanction of scientific authority, must have heard both these cases\r\n spoken to by medical gentlemen who had examined those two unfortunate\r\n patients after death, and who told us that in both cases they found\r\n the heart empty. That gets rid of that matter. As death takes place\r\n from one or other of these causes, so will be the appearance of the\r\n heart, the brain, and the body after death. There is nothing in\r\n this for a single moment to negative the conclusion which you would\r\n otherwise arrive at from the other symptoms.”\r\n\r\nFor the difficulty which he admitted arose from the non-discovery\r\nof strychnia by the analyst, he assigned another reason besides\r\nthat of the condition of the stomach and other parts from the\r\nnegligence imputed to those who had conducted the _post mortem_\r\nexamination—namely, the probable smallness of the fatal dose. In\r\nall the cases of experiments on animals in which the poison had been\r\ndetected, the doses had been one or even two grains, yet half a grain\r\nwould prove fatal; and where so little as that had been given in\r\nexperiments, Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees had failed to detect it. On the\r\npartisanship of Mr. Herapath, sitting by the side of the prisoner’s\r\ncounsel, prompting questions, and on his assertion that he believed\r\nthat Cook had been killed by strychnia and that Taylor could and ought\r\nto have detected it, his remarks were those rather of a French Public\r\nProsecutor than an Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n “I do not say that alters the fact; but I do say that it induces one\r\n to look at the credit of those witnesses with a very great amount\r\n of suspicion. I reverence a man who, from a sense of justice and a\r\n love of truth—from those high considerations which form the noblest\r\n character of man—comes forward in favour of a man against whom the\r\n world may turn in a torrent of prejudice and aversion, and who stands\r\n and states what he believes to be the truth. But I abhor the traffic\r\n in testimony to which, I regret to say, men of science sometimes\r\n permit themselves to condescend.”\r\n\r\nWhether Newton was believed or not—and he showed how his statement was\r\nconfirmed by Roberts’s account of Palmer’s conduct at the time of the\r\nsecond purchase of poison, he urged that of the latter fact there could\r\nbe no doubt, and asked what was done with that strychnia. That Palmer\r\nobtained this strychnia was not controverted, and what he did with it\r\nwas not attempted to be satisfactorily accounted for.\r\n\r\n “Purchased for whom? for what? If for a patient why is he not\r\n produced? If for any other purpose, let us at least have it explained.\r\n Has there been a shadow of an explanation? Alas, I grieve to say, none\r\n at all. Something was said, in the outset of the case, about dogs that\r\n had been troublesome in the paddocks, but that was in September. If\r\n there was any recurrence of this, why are not the grooms here to prove\r\n this? Some one must have assisted Palmer to destroy these dogs. Where\r\n are those persons? Why are they not called? Not only are they not\r\n called, they are not even named. My learned friend does not venture to\r\n breathe even a suggestion.”[69]\r\n\r\nAs for the witness called to disprove the incident of the brandy\r\nand water at Shrewsbury, his solitary evidence, that of one of the\r\nprisoner’s associates, he urged, would not stand for a moment against\r\nthose of the witnesses who had spoken for the prosecution. As for the\r\nattempt to prove that Palmer could not have been in Rugeley at the time\r\nwhen Newton swore that he purchased the strychnia, Mr. Jeremiah Smith’s\r\nantecedents, the disgraceful part he had played in the insurance\r\ntransactions, let alone his exhibition in the witness-box, he added,\r\ndeprived his evidence of credit.\r\n\r\nAgain, antimony was undoubtedly discovered in the body, and yet no one\r\nis known to have given it to Cook, unless Palmer did so in the broth,\r\nthe toast and water, and the coffee that he pressed him to take, and\r\nprovided for him. On the question of motive so anxiously laboured by\r\nthe defence, it was enough simply to repeat, the amounts of the debts\r\npressing on Palmer, and to bear in mind how drowning men will catch at\r\na straw. Cook’s bets, which Palmer had collected, staved off immediate\r\npressure; and had not Mr. Stevens, whose conduct as Cook’s relative the\r\nAttorney-General earnestly defended, insisted on the _post-mortem_, and\r\nthus brought about the inquest and this inquiry, it was possible that\r\nthe insurance office might have paid the policy on Walter’s life, and\r\nthe forged bills been thus redeemed in time to save exposure. Cook also\r\nwas valueless to help Palmer to keep these bills alive; even Pratt, the\r\n60 per cent. money-lender, would not discount his acceptance for £500\r\nwithout the security of a bill of sale on his horses.\r\n\r\nBetter acquainted with turf doings than his opponent, the\r\nAttorney-General smiled at the idea, that because a man was another’s\r\nconfederate on the turf therefore he made himself responsible for his\r\ndebts, or that Cook, with all his friendship for Palmer, would beggar\r\nhimself for his sake.\r\n\r\n “Joint engagement they had but one, the £500 bill secured on Sirius\r\n and Polestar, and it was to meet this, and free his horses, that Cook\r\n gave £300 out of his receipts at Shrewsbury to Palmer to send up to\r\n Pratt, and wrote to Fisher to advance the other £200. No £300 was\r\n sent up, and the £200, with the bets collected by Herring, went not\r\n to free this bill, but to stop Pratt’s action on the forged bill of\r\n £2000 of Palmer’s. It was no doubt true that after a man’s death, his\r\n bets were irrecoverable and his betting-book useless. It was, however,\r\n useful to enable Palmer to give a list of bets to Herring to collect,\r\n the proceeds of which were turned to his own use, and the previous\r\n collection of which Palmer withheld from Stevens. In the same way\r\n would have gone the cheque for £350 for the stakes—whether a forgery\r\n or not—but for the accident of their not having paid over in time.\r\n Had Cook lived, the closely approaching claim on his £500 acceptance,\r\n which he believed to have been settled, would have revealed the whole\r\n transaction.” [Again, the Attorney-General pressed for the production\r\n of the £350 cheque filled up by Cheshire.] “Why should Cheshire be\r\n asked to fill it up? Just about this time Palmer was to meet Dr.\r\n Bamford and Jones in consultation—why not ask Mr. Jones, the trusted\r\n friend of Cook, tell him the same story as he did Cheshire, and not\r\n send for the latter? From the day that this cheque was drawn till he\r\n was arrested on the bill, Palmer had undisturbed possession of his own\r\n papers—from the day of his arrest till his trial the papers had been\r\n in safe custody. Why, then, is it not produced? Can you help drawing\r\n the inference that the transaction will not bear the light? Look,\r\n again, at the claim of £3000 or £4000 of bills on Cook’s estate, the\r\n document Cheshire refused to witness, which is also not produced—the\r\n letter to Pratt that he must have Polestar, and the instructions not\r\n to give any information on Cook’s affairs. Can you doubt that they\r\n were all part of one fraudulent and flagitious design, for the full\r\n completion of which the death of Cook was a necessary thing?”\r\n\r\nPalmer’s conduct at the _post-mortem_, the tampering with the cover of\r\nthe jar—by whom?—his anxiety to upset Mr. Stevens when in charge of\r\nit, because, it had been urged, of “his prying meddlesome curiosity;”\r\nhis presents and letters to the coroner; his prompting Cheshire to\r\ntamper with the letter from Dr. Taylor; his anxiety to know, and to let\r\nthe coroner know, that strychnia had not been found; his suggestion to\r\ncall Smith (what a witness Jeremiah would have made!); his assertions\r\nof previous epileptic fits, and his hope “that the verdict to-morrow\r\nwould be that he died of natural causes, and thus end it,” were all\r\ndwelt upon: “little things, if taken individually, but taken as a\r\nwhole,” said the Attorney-General, “as I submit to you, leading\r\nirresistibly to the conclusion of the guilt of this man.”\r\n\r\nIn concluding this masterly speech, though in some parts too like\r\nfighting for a verdict, the Attorney-General criticised the assertion\r\nby Serjeant Shee of his belief of the prisoner’s innocence:—\r\n\r\n “You have, indeed, had introduced into this case one other element,\r\n which I own, I think, had better have been omitted. You have had from\r\n my learned friend the unusual, I think I may say the unprecedented,\r\n assurance of his conviction of the innocence of his client. I can\r\n only say upon that point that I think it would have been better if\r\n my learned friend had abstained from giving such an assurance. What\r\n would he think of me if, imitating his example, I should at this\r\n moment declare to you, on my honour, as he did, what is the intimate\r\n conviction which has followed from my own conscientious consideration\r\n of this case? My learned friend also, in his address, of which all\r\n admired the power and ability, adopting a course which is sometimes\r\n resorted to by advocates, but which, in my mind, involves more or\r\n less a species of insult to the good sense or good feeling of the\r\n jury—endeavoured to intimidate you, by an appeal to your consciences,\r\n from discharging firmly and honestly the great and solemn duty which\r\n you are called upon to perform. My learned friend told you that, if\r\n your verdict in this case should be ‘guilty,’ the innocence of the\r\n prisoner would one day be made manifest, and that you would never\r\n cease to regret the verdict which you had given. If my learned friend\r\n were sincere in that—and I know that he was, for there is no man\r\n in whom the spirit of truth and honour is more keenly alive—if he\r\n said what he believed, I can only answer that it shows how, when a\r\n man enters upon the consideration of a case with a strong bias on\r\n his mind, he is liable to err. I think then that my learned friend\r\n had better have abstained from making any assurance which involved\r\n his conviction of the prisoner’s innocence. I think, further—in\r\n justice and consideration to you—that he should have abstained from\r\n representing to you that the voice of the country would not sanction\r\n the verdict which you might give. I say nothing of the inconsistency\r\n which is involved in such a statement, coming from one who but a\r\n short hour before had complained in eloquent terms of the universal\r\n torrent of passion and of prejudice by which he said that his client\r\n would be borne down; but in answer to my learned friend I say this\r\n to you:—Pay no regard to the voice of the country, whether it be\r\n for condemnation or for acquittal; pay no regard to anything but to\r\n the internal voice of your own consciences, and to that sense of\r\n duty which you owe to God and man upon this occasion, seeking no\r\n reward except the comforting assurance that when you look back to the\r\n proceedings of this day you will feel that you have discharged to the\r\n utmost of your ability and to the best of your power the duty which\r\n it was yours to perform. If on a review of this whole case, comparing\r\n the evidence on one side and on the other, and weighing it in the even\r\n scales of justice, you can come to the conclusion of innocence, or can\r\n even entertain that fair and reasonable amount of doubt of which the\r\n accused is entitled to the benefit, in God’s name acquit him; but if,\r\n on the other hand, all the facts and all the evidence lead your minds,\r\n with satisfaction to yourselves, to the conclusion of his guilt,\r\n then—but then only—I ask for a verdict of ‘guilty’ at your hands.\r\n For the protection of the good, for the repression of the wicked, I\r\n ask for that verdict by which alone—as it seems to me—the safety\r\n of society can be secured, and the demands, the imperious demands of\r\n public justice, can be satisfied.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGE’S CHARGE.\r\n\r\nAs the learned Judge’s charge occupied the whole of the eleventh and\r\nuntil half-past four on the twelfth day, and was necessarily protracted\r\nby his reading in detail nearly all the voluminous evidence to the\r\njury, it would be impossible to give it in full. I shall, therefore,\r\nlimit this report to such of his observations, as have not already been\r\ngiven in the notes to the evidence of the various witnesses to whom\r\nthey applied.\r\n\r\nContrasting the practice in foreign countries of raising the\r\nprobability of guilt, from the fact of the previous commission by a\r\nprisoner of other crimes against other persons, and even of a totally\r\ndifferent character to that with which he then stands charged, Lord\r\nCampbell warned the jury that they must deal with him now as if he\r\nwere an entirely innocent man, and confine their attention solely\r\nto the evidence bearing on the crime itself. He warned them also\r\nthat the expression of his counsel’s opinion, that the prisoner was\r\ninnocent, meant no more than the plea of “Not Guilty,” and that the\r\nmost inconvenient consequences would follow from regarding it in any\r\nother light. Neither was it necessary, as a point of law, that the\r\npoison by which it was charged that the murder was effected, should\r\nbe found in the body, or seen to be administered. They must look to\r\nthe medical evidence to see whether the death was from that poison, or\r\nfrom natural causes, and to the moral evidence, whether that showed\r\nthat the prisoner not only had the opportunity, but that he actually\r\navailed himself of that opportunity, and administered the poison. He\r\nthen proceeded to read over the evidence, commencing with that showing\r\nthe indebtedness of Palmer to Pratt, in which Cook had no liability,\r\nand then taking up the joint liability of Palmer and Cook to the same\r\nperson in connection with the loan secured on Cook’s horses. With\r\nreference to the former transactions he called attention to Palmer’s\r\nletter to Pratt, “not to let Cook’s friends know what money Cook had\r\never had from him,” remarking, “that it was written at a time when the\r\nstepfather was making inquiries of a nature certainly very disagreeable\r\nto Palmer.” On the latter correspondence he called attention to the\r\ncheque for £375, sent by Pratt for Cook, on which Palmer wrote the\r\nendorsement, and admitted “that it was very properly argued for the\r\ndefence, that it was possible that Cook had authorised some one else\r\nto write it;” but coupled with it the circumstance that on the 13th of\r\nNovember Palmer was in a state of embarrassment, and that on the 20th\r\nhe could pay Armshaw two £50 notes, and that on the 22nd he could pay a\r\nfurther £50.\r\n\r\nAfter next reading the evidence of Wright, the attorney of Birmingham,\r\nto show how heavily Palmer was indebted to his brother, besides to\r\nPratt, and alluding to the bill of sale of all his property, he laid\r\ngreat stress on the non-production of the cheque on Weatherby for £350,\r\nthe production of which would have settled the question whether or not\r\nit was forged with the intention of appropriating it to his own use.\r\nMr. Serjeant Shee here interposing with the remark that Weatherby\r\nthought the signature genuine, Lord Campbell replied:—\r\n\r\n “Mr. Weatherby said the body of the cheque was not in Cook’s\r\n handwriting, and he had paid no attention to the signature. You,\r\n gentlemen, must consider the evidence with regard to this part of the\r\n case. The cheque is not produced, though it was sent back by Weatherby\r\n to Palmer. It is not produced” [here the judge read the evidence of\r\n the search for papers at Palmer’s]. “It might have been expected that\r\n the cheque so returned to Palmer, who professed to set store upon it,\r\n and to have given value for it, would have been found, but it is not\r\n forthcoming. It is for you to draw whatever inference may suggest\r\n itself to you from this circumstance.”\r\n\r\nThe judge then alluded to the fact of Palmer remaining in the\r\nneighbourhood after suspicion had been excited against him, as of\r\nimportance, and worthy of being taken into consideration, though, as he\r\nadded, “he might have done so, perhaps, thinking that from the care he\r\nhad taken nothing would be discovered against him,” and that neither\r\nthe bills nor the document by which Cook was said to have admitted\r\nhis liability on them were produced, and closed this portion of the\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nOn the incident of the brandy-and-water at Shrewsbury, the learned\r\njudge remarked, “What a mysterious circumstance it was, that Cook,\r\nafter he had stated his suspicions, still retained his confidence in\r\nPalmer—was still constantly in his company—during the few remaining\r\ndays of his life, still sent for him whenever in distress; and, in\r\nfact, seemed to a great extent to be under his influence.” In a\r\nsubsequent part of his charge, when dealing with the evidence for the\r\ndefence, he contrasted the evidence of Myatt in contradiction to that\r\nof Brooks and Fisher, and left the jury to draw their own conclusion\r\nwhich they would believe. Cook’s letter to Fisher to pay Pratt the £200\r\nwas also here read and commented on, and the jury left to infer why he\r\ndid not go to London as he proposed, and why he put the collection of\r\nhis bets in Herring’s hands instead of Fisher’s—“if he did so.”\r\n\r\nComing now to the illness at Rugeley, he said, “he was bound to declare\r\nthat not one fact had been adduced to prove that Mills had been bribed,\r\nor that Mr. Stevens had read over the newspaper to her, to influence\r\nher evidence in a particular direction: it was a gratuitous assertion,\r\nunsupported by evidence, and distinctly denied.” Whether the difference\r\nof Palmer’s dress when he ran over, as described by Mills or Barnes,\r\nwas of sufficient importance, was a question for the jury, and also\r\nwhether Mills’s deposition before the coroner, and her evidence in\r\nCourt (the deposition was read) was not substantially the same. On the\r\nletter from Palmer calling in Jones, cited by the defence as a proof of\r\ninnocence, he said:—\r\n\r\n “It is important, however, to consider at what period of Cook’s\r\n illness Jones was sent for, and in what condition he was when Jones\r\n arrived. Palmer’s assertion in the letter was, that Cook had been\r\n suffering from diarrhœa, and of this statement we have not the\r\n slightest confirmation in the evidence. When Jones, looking at Cook’s\r\n tongue, observed it was not the tongue of a bilious attack, Palmer’s\r\n reply was, ‘You should have seen it before.’ What reason could Palmer\r\n have for using these words, when there is not the slightest evidence\r\n of Cook having suffered from such an illness?” Then, having had\r\n Jones’s deposition before the coroner read, he added, “It is for you\r\n to say whether in your opinion this deposition at all varies from his\r\n evidence given here: I confess that I see no variation, and no reason\r\n to suppose that his evidence is not the evidence of sincerity and\r\n truth.”\r\n\r\nAfter observing that the evidence of Dr. Savage showed that previous to\r\nhis departure for Shrewsbury Cook was in better health than he had been\r\nfor a long time, the learned judge read the evidence of Newton, and his\r\ndeposition before the coroner. Remarking on his omitting to mention the\r\nfirst purchase of strychnia until the Tuesday morning, when coming to\r\nLondon, he said:—\r\n\r\n “You will observe that though there has been an omission, there is\r\n no contradiction. You are then to consider what is the probability\r\n of his inventing this wicked lie—a most important lie, if lie it\r\n be. He had no ill will towards the prisoner at the bar, he had never\r\n quarrelled with him, and had nothing to get by injuring him. I cannot\r\n see any motive for his inventing a lie to take away the life of the\r\n prisoner. No inducement was held out to him by the Crown. He says\r\n himself that no inducement was held out to him, and that at last he\r\n disclosed this circumstance from a sense of duty. If you believe his\r\n evidence, it is very strong against the prisoner.” And then, reading\r\n the evidence of Roberts and remarking that he was not cross-examined\r\n or in any way contradicted, he added—“If you couple that with the\r\n statement of Newton—believing that statement—you have evidence of\r\n strychnia having been procured by the prisoner on the Monday night\r\n before the symptoms of strychnia were exhibited by Cook; and by the\r\n evidence of Roberts, undenied and unquestioned, that on Tuesday six\r\n grains of strychnia were supplied to him. Supposing you should come\r\n to the conclusion that the symptoms of Cook were consistent with\r\n strychnia, then a case is made out for the Crown. The learned counsel\r\n did not favour us with the theory he had formed in his own mind\r\n with respect to that strychnia. There is no evidence—there is no\r\n suggestion—how it was applied; what became of it.[70] That must not\r\n influence your verdict, unless you come to the conclusion that Cook’s\r\n symptoms were consistent with death by strychnia. _But if you come to\r\n that conclusion, I should shrink from my duty—I should be unworthy\r\n to sit here—if I did not call your attention to the inference, that\r\n if he purchased that strychnia, he purchased it for the purpose of\r\n administering it to Cook._”\r\n\r\nThen, after vindicating the conduct of Mr. Stevens in relation to the\r\nloss of the betting-book, Lord Campbell alluded to the pushing of the\r\njar, at the _post-mortem_, as probably an accident, and its removal\r\nas “nothing more than the pushing, were it not coupled with evidence\r\nafterwards given, which might lead to the inference that there was a\r\nplan to destroy it and prevent the analysis of its contents.” He saw no\r\nreason to doubt the evidence of the postboy, and did not believe that\r\nStevens had given Palmer such provocation as to induce him to offer\r\nMyatt a bribe to upset him. “That is not indeed a decisive proof of\r\nguilt, but it is for you to say whether the prisoner did not enter on\r\nthat contrivance to prevent an opportunity of examining the jar, which\r\nmight contain evidence against him.”\r\n\r\nCheshire’s evidence as to filling up the cheque, and being asked\r\nto witness Cook’s signature, as if he was present, to the document\r\nprofessing to admit his liability on Palmer’s bills; his subsequent\r\ndealing with Dr. Taylor’s letter to Mr. Gardner; Palmer’s letter to\r\nthe coroner stating the result of the analysis; his presents to the\r\ncoroner; and his instructions to Bate not to let anyone see him deliver\r\nhis letter to Mr. Ward, together with the instructions to Herring\r\nabout Cook’s bets, were then carefully reviewed before entering on the\r\nmedico-scientific evidence offered on the part of the prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of this class of witnesses has been so fully reported,\r\nthat it is needless to repeat the Judge’s passing comments on their\r\ndescriptions of the symptoms of tetanus as consistent with those\r\nin Cook’s case, and with those exhibited in the cases of undoubted\r\npoisoning by strychnia, detailed by the medical men who had attended\r\nthe several patients. With reference to the results of the analysis by\r\nDrs. Taylor and Rees, and of the effect of their evidence, the learned\r\nJudge made the following comment on their experiments on animals:—\r\n\r\n “There is here a most important question for your consideration. Great\r\n reliance is placed by the prisoner’s counsel, and very naturally\r\n so, upon the fact that no trace of strychnia was detected in the\r\n stomach of Cook by Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees, who alone analysed it and\r\n experimented upon it. But, on the other hand, you must bear in mind\r\n that we have their own evidence to show that there may be and have\r\n been cases of death by strychnia in which the united skill of these\r\n two individuals has failed to detect the presence of the strychnia\r\n after death. Both Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees have stated upon their oaths\r\n that in two cases where they knew death to have been occasioned by\r\n strychnia—the poison having, in fact, been administered with their\r\n own hands—they failed to discover the slightest trace of the poison\r\n in the dead bodies of the animals on which they had experimented. It\r\n is possible that other chemists might have succeeded in detecting\r\n strychnia in those animals and strychnia also in the jar containing\r\n the stomach and intestines of Cook; but, however this may be, it is\r\n beyond all question that Dr. Taylor and Dr. Rees failed to discover\r\n the faintest indications of strychnia in the bodies of two animals\r\n which they had themselves poisoned with that deadly drug. Whatever\r\n may be the nature of the different theories propounded for the\r\n explanation of this fact, the fact itself is deposed to on oath; and,\r\n if we believe the witnesses, does not admit of doubt.” With regard\r\n to the letter from Dr. Taylor to Mr. Gardner, stating that neither\r\n strychnia, prussic acid, nor opium had been found in the body, his\r\n lordship said, “this letter was written before Cook’s symptoms had\r\n been communicated to them; but they had been informed that prussic\r\n acid, strychnia, and opium had been bought by Palmer on the Tuesday.\r\n They searched for all these poisons, and found none. The only poison\r\n they found was antimony, and they did not, therefore, in the absence\r\n of symptoms, attribute death to strychnia, as they could not at that\r\n time; but they say it might have been produced by antimony, as they\r\n say that the quantity found in the body was no test of the quantity\r\n taken into the system.”—“For the discovery of strychnia Dr. Taylor\r\n experimented upon the bodies of animals which he had himself killed by\r\n this poison, but in them no strychnia could be found. I do not know\r\n what interest Dr. Taylor could be supposed to have to give evidence\r\n against the prisoner. He was regularly employed by the Crown, and knew\r\n nothing of Palmer until he was called upon by Mr. Stevens, and the\r\n jar was given to him. He could have no enmity against the prisoner\r\n and no interest whatever to misrepresent facts.” [On being reminded\r\n that Dr. Taylor’s experiments on the two rabbits were not made until\r\n after the inquest,] “that,” said Lord Campbell, “makes no difference.\r\n If that experiment was made this morning the fact would be the same.\r\n Against Dr. Rees there is not even the imputation of having written\r\n an indiscreet letter to a newspaper. Yet Dr. Rees concurs with Dr.\r\n Taylor, that these rabbits were killed by strychnia; that they did\r\n whatever was in their power, according to their skill and knowledge,\r\n to discover strychnia, as they did with the contents of the jar, and\r\n that no strychnia could be discovered. As to antimony, he corroborates\r\n the testimony of Dr. Taylor. Antimony is a component of tartar emetic;\r\n tartar emetic produces vomiting, and you will judge from the vomiting\r\n at Shrewsbury and Rugeley whether antimony may have been administered\r\n to Cook at those places. Antimony may not have produced death, but the\r\n question of its administration is a part of the case which you must\r\n most seriously consider.”\r\n\r\nHaving then read the evidence of Professor Brande, Dr. Christison,\r\nand Dr. John Jackson, Lord Campbell, at eight o’clock, reserved the\r\nevidence for the defence to the next day.\r\n\r\nOn resuming his charge the next morning, Lord Campbell commenced by a\r\nbrief summary of his previous remarks.\r\n\r\n “The evidence for the prosecution certainly did present a serious case\r\n against the prisoner. It appeared that in November last he was most\r\n seriously embarrassed, and that he had to make payments for which he\r\n was entirely unprepared. There were actions against himself and his\r\n mother, and he had no credit left in any quarter. Cook by the races at\r\n Shrewsbury became master of £1000, and the inference had been drawn\r\n that Palmer formed a design of appropriating it to his own purposes,\r\n in order to relieve himself from his embarrassments. Again, it was\r\n proved that the prisoner drew a cheque in the name of Cook which was a\r\n forgery, for the purpose of appropriating to himself Cook’s property.\r\n What would have been the effect of the survival of Cook under those\r\n circumstances it would be for the jury to consider. No doubt, if Cook\r\n had lived, that cheque would have been brought forward, and would\r\n have led to an exposure of all Palmer’s delinquencies. With respect\r\n to the joint liability of Cook and Palmer, it was said that it was\r\n disadvantageous to Palmer that Cook should die; but there seemed to\r\n be some doubt whether it was not the intention of Palmer to possess\r\n himself of the whole of Cook’s property, and in that case he had a\r\n direct interest in his death. Then as to the medical evidence which\r\n had been adduced for the prosecution. The jury had heard the evidence\r\n of able and honourable men, who said that the deceased did not die a\r\n natural death, and that the symptoms were consistent with death by\r\n strychnia, and not consistent with death by ordinary _tetanus_. There\r\n was no point of law which required that the strychnia should be found\r\n in the body of the deceased, and it would therefore be for the jury\r\n on this point to consider whether the evidence of the prosecution was\r\n sufficient, or whether they could rely upon the answer which had been\r\n put in by the defence. There was direct evidence that the prisoner\r\n procured the poison of strychnia on Monday and Tuesday. What he did\r\n with it was not for him in that place to affirm. It was impossible for\r\n the jury not to pay attention to the conduct of the prisoner before\r\n and after the death of Cook, and they would not fail to consider,\r\n as part of those circumstances, his very remarkable proceedings in\r\n reference to the betting-book, which had never been discovered.”\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to consider the evidence tendered by medical and\r\nscientific experts for the defence.\r\n\r\n “Then as to the evidence which had been put in for the defence, the\r\n jury had had before them gentlemen of great ability and high honour,\r\n who had given in detail the results of their experience. With that\r\n evidence he would now proceed to deal.” [The learned judge read in\r\n extenso the voluminous evidence of Mr. Nunneley, the surgeon, of\r\n Leeds.] “The jury had heard the manner in which Mr. Nunneley had given\r\n his evidence, and they must form their own opinion of it. Certainly he\r\n seemed to display an interest in the case not altogether consistent\r\n with the character of a witness. He differed very much from several\r\n witnesses who were examined for the prosecution, and particularly\r\n in reference to rigidity being produced by strychnia after death.\r\n These and similar questions were for the jury. The next witness who\r\n was examined was Mr. Herapath, of Bristol, a very eminent analytical\r\n chemist, who had paid great attention to the subject of poisons.\r\n That gentleman said that where there had been death by strychnia it\r\n ought to be discovered. But it appeared, on cross-examination, that\r\n he had expressed an opinion, on another occasion, that Cook died from\r\n strychnia, but that Dr. Taylor had not taken the proper means to find\r\n it. After adverting to the evidence of Mr. Rogers, his lordship read\r\n that of Dr. Letheby, of the London Hospital, the medical officer of\r\n the City of London, of whom he said that he seemed to prove that cases\r\n of this sort were very variable, and that he admitted that the Romsey\r\n case was an exception. Now, while these exceptional cases existed,\r\n it could hardly be said that the principles laid down by Dr. Letheby\r\n were sufficient to rebut the evidence in chief. His lordship next\r\n referred to Mr. Gay’s case of the omnibus conductor. This, he said,\r\n was a case of idiopathic tetanus. The jury would say, on comparing\r\n it with the symptoms in Cook’s case, whether his was also a case of\r\n idiopathic tetanus. The great weight of evidence seemed to show that\r\n Cook’s was not a case of idiopathic any more than it was a case of\r\n traumatic tetanus. Mr. Gay’s case differed altogether from that of\r\n Cook, and as far as he could see there was no analogy between them.\r\n Passing next to the evidence of Mr. Ross, and to his case of a man,\r\n who died from ulcers, his lordship remarked that he did not see why\r\n this case was brought before the Court unless to prove that Cook’s was\r\n of the same sort. This was a case, whether of idiopathic or traumatic\r\n tetanus, in which it was sought to prove that death was caused by\r\n bruises on the body. But there were no bruises of any sort about\r\n Cook, and therefore the analogy failed. In reference to the important\r\n evidence of Dr. Wrightson, who said he had detected strychnia in\r\n putrifying blood and decomposed matter, and that strychnia did not\r\n under such circumstances decompose, he must say that this witness was\r\n a scientific and honourable man, and had spoken throughout with proper\r\n caution. According to Dr. Wrightson, the discovery of the poison\r\n should have been proved, but at the same time his evidence did not\r\n overthrow the case for the prosecution; and it would be for the jury\r\n to say whether, in the event of poison actually being in the body, the\r\n tests employed to detect it were sufficient. Referring to the evidence\r\n of Mr. Partridge, his lordship said that the witness had stated that\r\n the symptoms in Cook’s case did not correspond with what he should\r\n have expected to have found from strychnia, but he spoke from his own\r\n experience, and he admitted that the symptoms were very variable; and\r\n he did not seem, therefore, to speak with any degree of certainty upon\r\n the subject. Mr. Gay’s case of a boy who suffered from tetanus from\r\n an injury to his toe was, his lordship thought, not at all analogous\r\n to that of Cook; nor was that of the young woman who had an attack of\r\n tetanus without any apparent cause, and recovered, as deposed to by\r\n Dr. McDonald. The last witness had given his opinion that Cook died\r\n from epileptic convulsions, accompanied with tetanic complications,\r\n and this he thought might have been produced by mental or sensual\r\n excitement. The jury would see to what length this witness went, and\r\n it would be for the jury to say what weight they attached to his\r\n evidence. Having adverted to several cases adduced by the defence, and\r\n which his lordship considered bore no analogy to Cook’s, he read the\r\n evidence of Dr. Robinson, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who ascribed the death\r\n to epilepsy. He then passed on to Dr. Richardson, who narrated the\r\n particulars of a remarkable case of angina pectoris, to the symptoms\r\n of which disease he said Cook’s bore a remarkable resemblance. The\r\n witness, his lordship said, seemed a most respectable man, and he said\r\n that the symptoms in this case were consistent with those arising from\r\n strychnia, and that if he had known as much of strychnia at that time\r\n as he did now, he should have searched for it in that case. It would\r\n be for the jury to consider whether Cook’s symptoms were consistent\r\n with strychnia, and if so, that ought to lead them as to the opinion\r\n they should form on the case. His lordship having adverted to the\r\n evidence of Catharine Watson, the girl who was attacked with tetanus\r\n in Scotland, and to other witnesses who were recalled, said this was\r\n all the medical evidence that had been adduced by the counsel for\r\n the defence of the prisoner. But then, gentlemen, said Lord Campbell,\r\n comes that most important question, whether the symptoms of the\r\n deceased were consistent with death by poisoning with strychnia. You\r\n will say whether your opinion upon that subject is altered by the\r\n evidence given on the part of the prisoner. Several of the witnesses\r\n called by the prisoner seem to admit (although, of course, you will\r\n form your own judgment upon it) that those symptoms were consistent\r\n with strychnia, although, in the absence of evidence to show that\r\n strychnia was administered, they could not come to such a conclusion.”\r\n\r\nLord Campbell’s subsequent remarks on the witnesses who were called to\r\ncontradict those for the prosecution as to the state of Cook’s health,\r\nthe incident of the brandy and water at Shrewsbury, and the possibility\r\nof Palmer arriving in Rugeley from London at the time spoken to by\r\nNewton, have already been given in previous notes. In conclusion, he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n “The conduct of the prisoner in requesting to have the body fastened\r\n up, with respect to the betting book, and the tampering with the\r\n coroner, remained unanswered, as did also the bribe offered to the\r\n postboy. No explanation was offered as to the strychnia purchased\r\n by the prisoner on the Tuesday morning, the proof of which stands\r\n uncontradicted; no evidence has been given of any purpose to which it\r\n was to be applied, and no explanation of what became of that poison.\r\n The case was now before the jury. They must not act upon suspicion,\r\n or even strong suspicion, and they must only pronounce a verdict of\r\n guilty if their minds were made up. If, however, they could come to\r\n the conclusion that he was guilty, they would return such a verdict\r\n unfettered and undeterred by any intimidation.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee_ objected to the question put to the jury by the\r\n judge. He submitted that the question, whether the symptoms of Cook’s\r\n death were consistent with death by strychnia was a wrong one, unless\r\n coupled with the words “and inconsistent with death from natural\r\n causes,” and that the question should then be “whether the medical\r\n evidence established beyond all reasonable doubt that the death of\r\n Cook was attributable to strychnia.”\r\n\r\n _Baron Alderson._—“That is the question that has been put.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Serjeant Shee_ submitted that the question whether the symptoms\r\n were consistent with strychnia ought not to have been put.\r\n\r\n _Lord Campbell._—“ I have told the jury that, unless they think the\r\n symptoms described agree with the supposition that the deceased died\r\n from strychnia, they must acquit the prisoner.”\r\n\r\n _Baron Alderson._—“That has been stated in the speech.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further remarks from Mr. Serjeant Shee, Lord Campbell\r\ntold the jury that not only must they be satisfied that the symptoms\r\ndescribed agreed with the supposition that the deceased died from\r\nstrychnia, but that it was administered by the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe jury retired at 2.20, and at 3.45 returned a verdict of guilty, and\r\nLord Campbell passed sentence of death, to be carried out at Stafford\r\njail.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner heard the sentence perfectly unmoved. At one time he drew\r\nhimself up, as if about to make some remark, but did not attempt to\r\nspeak. He stood quite calm, and when his Lordship had concluded, turned\r\nround and walked from the dock with the same coolness as he had shown\r\nduring the whole of his protracted trial.\r\n\r\nContrasting the procedure in this memorable trial with what it might\r\nand no doubt would have been in a criminal court in France, Mr.\r\nJustice Stephen makes the following remarks:—“Not less remarkable\r\nthan the careful way in which all topics of prejudice were avoided\r\nwas the extreme fulness and completeness of the evidence as to facts\r\nreally relevant to the case. Nothing was omitted which the jury could\r\nproperly want to know, nor anything which the prisoner could possibly\r\nwish to say. No case could set in a clearer light the characteristic\r\nfeatures of English Criminal Law—namely, its essentially litigious\r\ncharacter, and the way in which it deals with scientific evidence. A\r\nstudy of the case will show, first, that evidence could not be more\r\ncondensed, more complete, more clearly directed to the point at issue;\r\nsecondly, that the subjection of all the witnesses, and especially\r\nthe scientific witnesses, to the most rigorous cross-examination is\r\nabsolutely essential to the trustworthiness of their evidence. The\r\nclearness and skill with which the various witnesses, especially\r\nthose for the defence, were cross-examined, and forced to admit that\r\nthey could not really distinguish the symptoms of Cook from those of\r\npoisoning by strychnia, was such an illustration of the efficiency of\r\ncross-examination as is rarely indeed afforded.”\r\n\r\n“The defence was by far the least impressive part of the trial, but\r\nthat was mainly because there was nothing to say. It was impossible to\r\nsuggest any innocent explanation of Palmer’s conduct. It was proved\r\nto demonstration that he was in dire need of money in order to avoid\r\na prosecution for forgery; that he robbed his friend of all he had\r\nby a series of devices which he must instantly have discovered if he\r\nhad lived; that he provided himself with the means of committing the\r\nmurder just before Cook’s death; and that he could neither produce the\r\npoison he had bought, nor suggest any innocent reason for buying it.\r\nThere must have been some mystery in the case which has never been\r\ndiscovered. Palmer, at and before his death, was repeatedly pressed to\r\nsay whether he was guilty or not, and told that everyone would believe\r\nhim guilty if he did not emphatically deny it. He could only say Cook\r\nwas not poisoned by strychnia, and I have reason to know that he was\r\nanxious that Mr. Herapath should examine the body for strychnia, though\r\naware that he could detect the 1-50,000th part of a grain. He may have\r\ndiscovered some way of administering it which would render detection\r\nimpossible, but it is difficult to doubt that he used it; for if not,\r\nwhy buy it?”[71]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEEDS POISONING CASE.\r\n\r\n _Before_ BARON BRAMWELL, NORTHERN CIRCUIT, YORK, _July 16, 17, and 18,\r\n 1856_.\r\n\r\n _For the Prosecution_: Mr. Overend, Q.C., Mr. G. Hardy, and Mr. L. H.\r\n Bayly.\r\n\r\n _For the Defence_: Mr. Bliss, Q.C., Mr. Serjeant Wilkins, and Mr.\r\n Middleton.[72]\r\n\r\n_William Dove_, aged 30, was indicted for the murder of his wife, on\r\nthe 1st of March, 1856, at Leeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY LIFE OF THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner, the son of a respectable leather manufacturer at Leeds,\r\nhad been, from his childhood to his seventh year, more than usually\r\nfractious, mischievous, ill-natured, and irrational in his tricks:\r\nputting lighted candles more than once in a basket and locking them\r\nin a cupboard: pouring some kind of spirits on his bedroom curtains\r\nand setting them on fire: chasing his sisters with a red-hot poker and\r\nthreatening to burn them: hanging a cat by its tail out of window:\r\ncutting himself with knives and writing his name with his blood: an\r\nirregular and inapt scholar, especially in his religion.[73] The usher\r\nat his first school, where he was from the age of ten to thirteen\r\nyears, regarded him “as a boy of very low intellect, great inability\r\nof mind, great want of moral power, evil and vicious propensities.\r\nOnce, when he had got a pistol, he told his schoolfellows he was\r\ngoing to shoot his father—a dull boy, and a had boy. I then thought\r\nhim insane, but did not feel myself in a position to object to his\r\nbeing flogged.”[74] Mr. Highley, the master of this school, spoke\r\nstrongly of Dove’s bad conduct, which he attributed to his reasoning\r\npowers being very limited. “He appeared,” said the witness, “to have\r\nno idea of any consequences; to be deprived of reason. I am satisfied\r\nhe was labouring under an aberration of intellect.”[75] Having been\r\nexpelled from his school, his father took the opinion of a Mr. Lord,\r\na schoolmaster, as to what was best to be done with the boy. “I could\r\nmake no impression on his heart or his head,” said Mr. Lord. “He\r\ncould not appreciate what I said. He listened, but I could make no\r\nimpression—get no rational answers. When I heard of his engagement I\r\ntold his future wife’s brother-in-law that inquiry ought to be made\r\nabout Dove on account of his unaccountable irrational conduct.” By Mr.\r\nLord’s advice, he was sent to learn farming, for more than five years,\r\nwith a Mr. Frankish. Here again his mischievous and cruel propensities\r\nwere exhibited—putting vitriol on the tails of some cows, burning\r\nhalf-grown kittens with it, putting it into the horse-trough, and\r\nsetting fire to the gorse. He was as unapt a scholar at farming as at\r\nreligion and grammar. Again, when he went to another farmer for a year,\r\nhe was the same dull unpractical pupil. He was now sent to America for\r\na short visit, returning with travellers’ stories of his adventures of\r\nunusual wildness and incredibility. Still, however, he was deemed by\r\nhis father capable of being trusted with a farm, where his mischievous\r\nand extravagant conduct astonished his servants, and made them regard\r\nhim as “not of a sound mind.”[76] At this time, 1852, he married,\r\nquarrelling or playing with his wife like a child, and changed his\r\nfarm more than once, without apparent reason. Other witnesses spoke to\r\nthe incoherence of his conversation: of his lying on the ground and\r\ncrying without a cause; complaining of noises in his house; trying\r\nto reap his own corn in a green state; exhibiting conjuring tricks,\r\nand talking of having put a spell on the steward of the proprietor\r\nof one of his farms. Eventually, in consequence of his intemperate\r\nhabits, he had to give up farming and remove into the outskirts of\r\nLeeds, where he lived on an annuity of £90 a year, left to him by his\r\nfather, who died in 1854. With nothing to do, he became an habitual\r\ndrunkard, aggravating his eccentricities, stimulating his mischievous\r\npropensities, and stupefying himself as to the consequences of his\r\nactions to himself.[77] With such propensities, it may be conceived\r\nthat his wife led a wretched life; that quarrels were frequent; that at\r\none time he threatened her with a pistol; and that eventually, after a\r\nvery few years, they occupied separate beds, and rarely met, except at\r\nmeals. Unfortunately for both of them, an arrangement for a separation\r\nwas broken off by the interposition of injudicious friends, and until\r\nthe beginning of 1856 they endured their miserable life together.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the enquiries into the death of Cook at\r\nRugeley were filling the newspapers, and the evidence on the inquest\r\nbecame matter of popular discussion. Among Dove’s friends was one\r\nHarrison, known as the Witchman of Leeds, who, according to his own\r\naccount, was “a dentist, a water caster, a caster of nativities, and a\r\nbeliever in the stars.” On hearing this man read, in a public-house,\r\nthe results of the analytical examination of Cook’s body by Dr. Taylor,\r\nas related at the inquest, and that gentleman’s statement of the\r\ndifficulty, if not impossibility, of discovering strychnia by chemical\r\nanalysis, Dove appears to have been forcibly struck by the revelation.\r\nHe asked Harrison either to make or get him some strychnia, and, when\r\nhe refused, said he could get it elsewhere. Probably at that time the\r\nidea of poisoning his wife was first entertained by him. Unfortunately\r\nhe had no difficulty in obtaining the necessary poison, as he was\r\nintimately acquainted with Mr. Morley, the surgeon of Leeds, who had\r\nattended the Dove family for many years, and was a constant visitor\r\nto his surgery. Subsequently, therefore, to his acquiring knowledge\r\nof what had happened in Palmer’s case, he had repeated conversations\r\nwith one of Mr. Morley’s pupils about strychnia; and on the 10th of\r\nFebruary, on the plea that his house was infested by rats, and that he\r\nwas worried by his neighbour’s cats, he obtained from him ten grains of\r\nthis deadly poison. This he placed about the house in a careless way,\r\nand destroyed a cat, the body of which he buried in the midden. Again\r\non the 17th he got four or five grains more of strychnia, promising the\r\npupil who gave it to him the skin of a grey cat which he professed to\r\nbe about to poison with it. At this time, the pupil was of opinion that\r\nDove noted whereabouts on the shelf the bottle of strychnia was placed.\r\nA few days after he was seen by Mr. Morley’s coachman in the surgery\r\nalone, with the gas turned up, which, as the coachman came near, he\r\nturned down, and in an apparent flurry, meeting him at the door, gave\r\nas his excuse that he had come to light his pipe.[78] The suggestion\r\nof the prosecution was that at this time, knowing where the bottle of\r\nstrychnia was kept, he took the opportunity of helping himself to\r\nsome more of the poison. During all this time it was evident, from his\r\nconversations on strychnia and the impossibility of its detection, that\r\nhe had studied Palmer’s case.\r\n\r\nPreviously to Sunday, the 24th of February, Mrs. Dove had not been\r\nwell, but on that day appeared quite recovered. On the Monday, however,\r\nwhen she went upstairs with her servant to make the beds, she was\r\nsuddenly taken ill, staggered, became paralysed, twitched and jumped,\r\nand when put on the bed, on the slightest touch either of her body or\r\nthe bedclothes, had renewed convulsions. Dove, who was downstairs,\r\nwas sent for, and went for the doctor, to whom he said that his wife\r\nhad been ill all night, and asked if his wife died would there be a\r\ncoroner’s inquest?[79] After two or three hours the convulsions passed\r\naway, and the patient remained free from pain. Dove’s attention to his\r\nwife was suspiciously marked. He gave her medicine with his own hands;\r\ncalled in a neighbour to attend to her, and seemed greatly distressed\r\nat her condition. Three days after, a second attack of the same nature\r\noccurred, and again he told the doctor he was sure his wife would die.\r\nShe was seen to cry bitterly, and heard to say that she was sure the\r\nmedicine, of the bitter taste of which she complained, was killing her.\r\nNext evening a third attack came on, with the same symptoms. And on the\r\n28th Dove predicted that she would have another attack about ten that\r\nevening; at that hour he gave her the medicine, and in half an hour\r\nafterwards another and more severe attack came on, so severe that she\r\nsaid, “Oh dear, I thought it was all over.” In all these attacks after\r\na time the spasms and convulsions passed away, and she was apparently\r\nonly suffering from exhaustion after them, and otherwise quite well.\r\nOn Saturday Dove, who had gone out, returned much in liquor, and at 8\r\nP.M. gave her her medicine. “It is very disagreeable,” she said, “hot\r\nand bitter.” He washed out the glass and wiped it as usual, saying, “I\r\nalways wash it out; medicine is always such nasty stuff.” Within half\r\nan hour of taking this dose an attack more than usually violent came\r\non, and after a series of spasms and convulsions the poor creature died\r\nabout twenty minutes to eleven that night.\r\n\r\nStruck with the resemblance of the symptoms of Mrs. Dove’s attacks to\r\nthose due to poisoning by strychnia, and hearing from his pupil of the\r\npurchase of that drug by the prisoner, Mr. Morley, who had attended\r\nher, decided on having a _post-mortem_ examination. This Dove, who\r\nhad on her first attack asked Morley’s pupil whether Mr. Morley would\r\nhave a _post-mortem_ examination if his wife died, tried to prevent,\r\non the plea of his having promised his wife that it should not be\r\nallowed, and his horror at the desecration of her body. Mr. Morley,\r\nhowever, obtained the consent of Dove’s mother, and persevered. On\r\nthe examination of the body by himself and Mr. Nunneley, the surgeon,\r\nand the subsequent chemical analysis of its different parts, every\r\ntest proved the presence of strychnia in large quantities. During the\r\nexamination of the body, blood to the extent of a crown piece fell on\r\nthe floor of the room, and a week after the spaniel of a woman who was\r\ncleaning the room was supposed to have licked it, and as she left on\r\nthe completion of her work, was attacked with violent spasms, fell on\r\nits back, and died at once. On the examination of its body strychnia\r\nwas also detected. The prisoner, who after his wife’s funeral had\r\nwandered about, asking Harrison and other persons whether it was safe\r\nto go back, and talking about the possibility of the wife having taken\r\nthe strychnia by accident, as he had carelessly placed it in his\r\nrazor case, and put it about in the house, was subsequently arrested\r\nand put upon his trial. It is needless to give in detail the evidence\r\nof the persons by whom the above facts were proved, which were hardly\r\ntraversed by counsel for the defence. The testimony with reference to\r\nthe symptoms and the results of the _post-mortem_ examination cannot,\r\nhowever, with safety be abridged, seeing the importance attached to\r\nthis case in Palmer’s trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\n_Ann Fisher_, who took her daughter’s place in the house in consequence\r\nof the latter’s illness, said—\r\n\r\n “On Saturday and Sunday Mrs. Dove appeared pretty well, and on the\r\n latter day went to church. On Monday, February 25, after breakfast,\r\n she complained of her legs, and said she felt curious, and fell in\r\n the bedroom whilst helping witness to make the beds. Witness caught\r\n her in her arms, and called up Dove, who went for Mrs. Witham (next\r\n door neighbour), and witness put Mrs. Dove to bed. _She started, and\r\n twitched, and jumped, and, even if witness touched the bedclothes,\r\n or walked across the room, complained that it made her worse._ Mr.\r\n Scarth (Morley’s assistant) came and gave some medicine, and she felt\r\n better. The jerkings continued from two to two and a half hours. She\r\n lay on her right side, and her breathing was rather difficult: she was\r\n quite sensible the whole time. She seemed better in the afternoon, and\r\n pretty well the next morning. On Wednesday, the 27th, _she had another\r\n attack, beating, jumping, and starting; complained about her legs and\r\n back being very bad: said there was a stiffness in them; they seemed\r\n paralysed, and she could not move them about_. _She lay on her side,\r\n and her breathing was_ very bad when she had these attacks on her. She\r\n was better after the medicines on the two occasions on which I gave\r\n them to her myself. I cannot recollect Thursday, but on Friday night,\r\n about 10 P.M., I was called up into the bedroom. Dove was dressed,\r\n standing by the bedside holding her hand. _Her back was quite arched,\r\n and she was making a great noise in her inside. She said, ‘Oh dear, I\r\n thought it had been my last.’ Her breathing was very difficult. She\r\n complained about her jaws being stiff._ I stayed with her till about 2\r\n A.M., and she was better, and I went to bed. Next morning she said she\r\n was very poorly, and could not take any coffee. She had had no rest\r\n all night. She took some coffee afterwards, and had a little rest. In\r\n the afternoon Mrs. Witham was with her. She appeared much better then,\r\n washed herself _and rubbed her legs, which seemed to ease her_. She\r\n became worse at 8.30 P.M. The bell was rung: Mrs. Wood and Mrs. Witham\r\n were with her. Dove was out—had gone out about a quarter to half an\r\n hour. _She then moaned and screamed; her body was quite arched and her\r\n feet projected right from her body, and she was in that state till\r\n twenty minutes to eleven, when she died._ Before she died she grasped\r\n the hands of Mrs. Wood and Mrs. Witham, who were holding hers, so hard\r\n that it hurt them. Dove came back at about ten: she was then in great\r\n agony. As soon as he saw me, he told me he was going to Mr. Morley’s\r\n for medicine, and that if Mrs. Wood wanted to go home, I was to go up\r\n and take her place. When he returned with the doctors, she was dead.”\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Witham_,[80] the next door neighbour who attended the deceased\r\nalmost daily, confirmed Mrs. Fisher’s account of the earlier symptoms,\r\nand gave the following details of the night of her death:—\r\n\r\n “On Saturday, March the 1st, I saw her again about 2.30 P.M. She\r\n seemed better, and I remained with her till about six. At 3.30 P.M. I\r\n gave her her medicine. Mr. Morley came at four, when she seemed well.\r\n I got the food he ordered for her, and she seemed better than I had\r\n seen her before. Dove was there, and when I told him I had given her\r\n the medicine, he said she ought not to have it until about five. I was\r\n sent for again later to sit with her until Mrs. Fisher came, as Dove\r\n was going for medicine. _He was rubbing her legs_, and asked her to\r\n kiss him, which she did. Shortly after, he gave her her medicine. He\r\n went to the washstand, and came back with a glass in one hand, with\r\n the medicine and water in the other. He was at the washstand time\r\n enough to pour out the medicine. Mrs. Wood was present. After she had\r\n taken it, Mrs. Dove complained that it was very hot, and asked for a\r\n lozenge. _Dove took the glass to the washstand, and said he always\r\n washed it out after giving the medicine._ He then left, as he said, to\r\n get more medicine. In about a quarter of an hour _she complained of\r\n her back: her head was thrown back. I took hold of her hand, and she\r\n grasped it so tightly I could not get it away. Her eyes looked fixed.\r\n I put my hand to them: they did not move. Her features were very much\r\n distorted, and her teeth clinched. We both took hold of her hands,\r\n which she grasped so tightly that I could not bear it. Mrs. Wood was\r\n going to rub her back. She said, ‘Oh, don’t; lift me up,’ and I and\r\n Mrs. Wood tried to do so. Her back was arched, her body quite stiff,\r\n her legs stretched out. I did not notice her feet. We lifted her up,\r\n and put a pillow under her back. She rested on her shoulders, and the\r\n bottom part of her back, until the pillow was placed under her. The\r\n symptoms grew more violent, but she could speak. Her breathing was\r\n loud and difficult. She shrieked several times—a sort of scream. In\r\n about half an hour she could speak no longer. We could not be positive\r\n if she was sensible, and at twenty minutes to eleven she died._ Dove\r\n came in after she had ceased to speak, threw off his coat, and was\r\n going to rub her legs, when I said she could not bear it. Mrs. Wood\r\n said something to him, and he left the house immediately. When the\r\n doctors came she had been dead some minutes.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_ the witness said—\r\n\r\n “That when she gave her the medicine about three o’clock, deceased\r\n complained that it was bitter, as witness found it was on tasting it:\r\n (it contained aloes). That when the attack came on she appeared to\r\n lose her senses very soon, her eyes being fixed, and not speaking:\r\n this was in about an hour. She spoke until half an hour after her\r\n attack, but not until forty minutes. She was in better health and\r\n spirits on the Saturday than she had been all the week. _She was\r\n rubbed after each fit, and it seemed to relieve her. The jumpings\r\n and twitchings went on, on the Saturday, and she was then some hours\r\n still, and then they began again._”\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Wood_ added the following particulars of the last attack:—\r\n\r\n “I went at twenty minutes to eight on the Saturday evening and found\r\n her sitting up; her husband and Mrs. Witham were with her. About\r\n eight she asked her husband for her medicine; he went out of the\r\n room to get it, and returned in about a minute with it, and gave it\r\n to her. She said it was very bitter, very hot, and very nasty, and\r\n that she thought she would get better if the attack did not return. I\r\n recommended her to try and put it off. _In about a quarter of an hour\r\n after taking the medicine she began to be ill. I asked Mrs. Witham to\r\n go round and take her hand, saying, ‘this Gird is coming on.’ She was\r\n propped up with pillows. In a short time she said, ‘Off the bed’ and\r\n repeated it three times. I thought at that time she wished to get off\r\n the bed. Mrs. Witham said, ‘Oh no, we cannot.’ I do not think she was\r\n sensible after she said ‘Off the bed’ the first time._ She died at\r\n twenty minutes to eleven. Dove went for the doctors; when he returned\r\n she was dead.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Scarth_, Morley’s pupil, who attended on the 25th of February, at\r\nthe request of the prisoner, in Mr. Morley’s absence, said—\r\n\r\n “I found Mrs. Dove in bed _with very minute twitchings of the muscles\r\n of the face and arms, and her teeth closed—hands clinched—head\r\n thrown slightly back, and the shoulders likewise, and her feet\r\n stretched straight out with the legs_. Again I saw her at seven on\r\n the Thursday night, _the symptoms were the same, but her principal\r\n complaint was of pain in the shoulders and back_. _Her shoulders\r\n were thrown back._ The attack passed off whilst I was there in about\r\n five minutes. I gave her the draught prescribed by Mr. Morley, and\r\n the convulsions ceased and did not return, and I ordered her the\r\n repetition of the draught.”\r\n\r\nThis witness had the cat dug out of the midden, in which the prisoner\r\nsaid he had buried it, and was present when Mr. Morley and Mr. Nunneley\r\nexperimented on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL AND ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_Mr. George Morley_, a surgeon at Leeds, who had always attended the\r\nDove family, was called in to the deceased in December, 1855, when he\r\nfound her suffering from disordered digestion and nervous excitement.\r\nShe improved, and he subsequently only saw her at long intervals till\r\nthe 25th of February; on that day, he said—\r\n\r\n “I found her in bed, and only observed _twitchings of the arms twice_.\r\n She told me she had had an attack in the morning with pains in the\r\n back and limbs, and had been often before so, and that she suffered\r\n from an excitable temperament. I thought it an hysterical attack, as\r\n she was at the age for them. Saw her every day during the week, and on\r\n the Wednesday and Thursday again _saw slight jerking of the arms_. On\r\n the Friday and Saturday she was decidedly better, and I did not alter\r\n my opinion of her case until the Saturday night, as I had often seen\r\n such symptoms arise from hysteria. I made the medicines antispasmodic\r\n and sedative: they would check the symptoms, and for a time seemed to\r\n do so. On Wednesday I proposed seeing another doctor, when Dove said\r\n she would not recover, and I warned him not to say so in her hearing,\r\n and that he had better call in a physician. Next day I received a note\r\n from him declining the proposed consultation, as his wife had perfect\r\n confidence in me. On Saturday I received a message that she was worse,\r\n and that I was to bring Dr. Hobson with me. Dove came afterwards to my\r\n house, and said he thought she would not recover, and that he should\r\n object to a _post mortem_ examination. I said I thought there would be\r\n no need of one, and that she would recover. He said his wife objected\r\n to it strongly. He seemed excited, as with drink, but quite rational.\r\n We were too late to see Mrs. Dove alive. From what Mr. Scarth told me\r\n I took measures for a _post mortem_ examination.\r\n\r\n “I now attribute the symptoms I have heard described to the poison of\r\n strychnia—from the symptoms and what I found in the body—finding in\r\n the body no organic disease to account for death. _The symptoms do not\r\n correspond with those of any other disease, but do with those produced\r\n by strychnia._ In hysteria the symptoms are more irregular; they do\r\n not assume a tetanic character; there is more disturbance of the mind;\r\n and such attacks are never fatal. Tetanic affections are stiffening\r\n of the limbs, rigidity, and stretching out of the limbs, arching\r\n back of the trunk, stiffening of the neck and jaw. The symptoms of\r\n hysteria might be some of those symptoms. No one but might be found\r\n in hysteria, but not all together. The symptoms are separately and\r\n conjointly in accordance with poisoning by strychnia. On Monday, March\r\n 3rd, _forty-two_ hours after death, by authority of the prisoner’s\r\n mother, I made a _post mortem_ examination in conjunction with Mr.\r\n Nunneley, and drew up the following joint report.”\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to give in detail the first portion of this report,\r\nin which, from a most careful examination of all parts of the body, it\r\nwas evident that the death could not be attributed to any known organic\r\ndisease. With the exception of a slight appearance of congestion in\r\nthe intestines, every part of the body was in a healthy state, and the\r\nstomach contained only usual food. The report then continued:—\r\n\r\n “No appearance of irritation from any mineral or other irritant\r\n poison, nor any odour of any poison recognizable by smell. Hence we\r\n searched for strychnia. We divided the stomach and its contents into\r\n three parts:—(1.) The brown pulpy mass in the stomach; (2.) The\r\n mucous and all other matters that could be removed from the stomach;\r\n (3.) The stomach itself. By the usual tests we obtained strychnia from\r\n each of these. The spirituous extracts were also unusually bitter. In\r\n the contents of the intestines we found only faint traces. We obtained\r\n the body of the cat, that had been poisoned some time before, and\r\n proved that it is possible to discover strychnia in a dead body some\r\n time after death. The result was decidedly the same evidence as we had\r\n from the human body.”\r\n\r\nThe report then gave the details of the processes by which the\r\nstrychnia had been detected. (1.) Taste; (2.) Nitric acid, producing a\r\nred colour (_the test for brucia_); (3.) Acetic acid and solution of\r\nchloride of gold, producing a yellowish-white precipitate (_of doubtful\r\nvalue_); (4.) Concentrated sulphuric acid and solution of bichromate of\r\npotash, both in powder and in solution, producing the purple colour;\r\n(5.) The application of the same tests to strychnia itself with the\r\nsame results, by each of them separately, and repeated with such\r\nvariations as could detect any error that might have crept in, and\r\nthe conclusion to which the analysts came that the stomach contained\r\nstrychnia enough to cause death.\r\n\r\nThe report then described the effects of administering portions of\r\nthe spirituous extracts proved to have contained strychnia to several\r\nanimals, five in number. In the cases of four of these, two rabbits,\r\none mouse, and a guinea-pig, the liquid was given by inoculation\r\nthrough small openings either in the cellular tissues beneath the\r\nskin, or into one of the mucous cavities of the body; and in the case\r\nof one of the mice, by the mouth. In three cases death followed at\r\nthe respective intervals of two, twelve, and fifty minutes after the\r\nintroduction of the poison; and in one case—that of a rabbit—although\r\nfor a time it remained nearly dead, it afterwards revived, and\r\neventually recovered. In the case of the pig, the effects were much\r\nmore slight; the spasms were not so violent as to throw it down and\r\nentirely disable it, but on the following day it was found dead, with\r\nthe muscles rigid, and the hind legs extended, as if from poison.\r\n“_The symptoms preceding death, in all the cases, were, disturbed\r\nrespiration, general distress, convulsive twitchings and jerkings,\r\ntetanic spasms, a peculiar out-stretching of the legs, and general\r\nrigidity, exactly those commonly produced by strychnia._” The same\r\neffects, for the sake of comparison, were produced in a parallel series\r\nof experiments on animals with ordinary strychnia, which, as a series,\r\nwere not more severe, or more rapidly fatal. “These experiments,” said\r\nthe analysts, “which add the test of physiological effect to that of\r\nthe chemical reagent, directly confirm our analysis, and taking them\r\nin connection with the analyses and with the symptoms observed during\r\nlife, and with the appearances noted after death, they afford, in our\r\nopinion, the most complete proof that the death of Mrs. Dove was from\r\nthe poisonous effects of strychnia, and from no other cause.”\r\n\r\nThe witness then spoke from his own personal knowledge of cases of\r\npoisoning by strychnia, and continued:—\r\n\r\n “I cannot refer the death to any other cause, nor the symptoms\r\n during life, as described by the witnesses Witham, Fisher, and Wood.\r\n _There is no other substance that will produce such symptoms and\r\n appearances._ I tried similar experiments on a little dog, with the\r\n same results. _Strychnia is not a cumulative poison. The effect of of\r\n it passes off entirely by a gradual subsidence of the spasms. In part\r\n the strychnia is absorbed in the blood, in part it passes off by the\r\n secretions, part remains in the stomach, its carbon, hydrogen, and\r\n other constituents broken up. If not decomposed, it would act on other\r\n animals._ The series of symptoms produced by strychnia were complete.\r\n I have no doubt that each of the several attacks were produced by\r\n strychnia. Several of the medicines I sent to Mrs. Dove were bitter,\r\n containing aloes and gentian, and hot, containing ammonia and\r\n ether. _The effects of strychnia would follow from in a few seconds\r\n to an hour and a half, depending on the constitution of the person,\r\n and state of the stomach, and how the strychnia was administered._\r\n Assuming that Mrs. Dove took no food or tea, I should refer the time\r\n at which she took the strychnia to the time at which she took the\r\n medicine. That would be the natural time for the attack; she would be\r\n attacked in a quarter to half an hour after taking it. The strychnia\r\n I had in my surgery was a soft white powder, fine, but not so fine as\r\n salt. There is a form of pure crystallised strychnia more like salt.\r\n I should judge that she had taken two to three grains to produce the\r\n results of Saturday night. You might take two or three grains between\r\n your finger and thumb: a quarter of a grain would kill a dog. I have\r\n examined one of the bottles of medicine which I sent to Mrs. Dove; it\r\n is the same as I sent.”\r\n\r\nThe witness also related the following conversations with the\r\nprisoner:—\r\n\r\n “During the _post-mortem_ examination, I had a conversation with\r\n the prisoner at his mother’s. He asked me what we had found in the\r\n analysis—had we found poison? I said the analysis was not complete,\r\n and could not give any answer till it was. I said we had not found\r\n any natural causes of death. He asked me, ‘If poison was found, what\r\n would the jury say? ‘ I replied, that ‘They could only say it was\r\n taken by accident, or intentionally, or given to her by some one.’ He\r\n wished me to let him know before the inquest if we had found poison.\r\n I had inquired about his getting poison, and asked him how often.\r\n He replied, ‘Only once, and that he had it to kill mice, as well as\r\n cats; had placed it in his razor-case, and told his wife that it was\r\n the poison Palmer used; that it was a deadly poison, and she must not\r\n touch it.’ I never told him there should be no examination.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_ by Mr. Bliss, after speaking to his having\r\nattended the Dove family for many years, but seen but little of the\r\nprisoner before he came to Leeds, the witness said—\r\n\r\n “When the conversation about strychnia took place, the prisoner\r\n asked me if I suspected him, and said, ‘Should I have done it openly\r\n if I had intended to do it? Should I have come to your surgery for\r\n it or have talked openly about it to other people? Could I have\r\n been so cruel?’ That was the first time that I named strychnia to\r\n any relative. I examined the little dog and have no doubt it died\r\n of strychnia. They brought me a piece of carpet and the board on\r\n which was blood, but I discovered no strychnia. I could not; the\r\n quantity was too small. I think the stains in the carpet and on the\r\n board could not have contained strychnia enough to have poisoned the\r\n dog. I discovered very little blood in the intestines. Strychnia is\r\n exceedingly bitter. One part in 40,000 would be bitter, less would be\r\n perceptibly bitter. There was a considerable quantity of fæces in the\r\n intestines, and three or four ounces of digested food. Mrs. Dove’s\r\n medicines were alkaline. I saw Mrs. Dove every day from Monday to\r\n Saturday, and she told me her ailments. I found nothing in the body\r\n to account for death but the strychnia taken on Saturday. Strychnia\r\n is not soluble in alkali. The symptoms I have heard to-day, prior\r\n to those on Saturday, are additional to what I saw. Hysteria would\r\n have left no symptoms. There was nothing inconsistent with strychnia\r\n having been administered before in the appearances of the body. The\r\n engorged state of the lungs and the condition of the brain favoured\r\n that view. _I say this guardedly._ She might with this condition of\r\n body have been better on Saturday, as congestion would pass away\r\n quickly. I found no symptoms on Saturday of the brain or lungs being\r\n engorged. She was better in health, in spirits, and in appetite. Mrs.\r\n Witham’s and Mrs. Fisher’s statements have changed my opinion. The\r\n symptoms they describe are all to be found separately in hysteria. Mr.\r\n Scarth’s account also influenced me, which I did not hear until after\r\n her death. It was my opinion at the time that she was affected with\r\n hysteria. _In a paroxysm from strychnia it is possible that a patient\r\n might wish to be rubbed, but it is not what I should ‘à priori,’ look\r\n for. Touch sometimes renews the spasms, but it depends upon the stage.\r\n The desire not to be touched is a symptom of strychnia._ After hearing\r\n of her symptoms I prescribed a liniment to be rubbed. _It consisted\r\n with the dose of strychnia said to have been administered that she\r\n should be better on Saturday._ The effect of hysteria would be to\r\n gorge the vessels of the brain and lungs. _Not shrinking from touch\r\n was consistent with strychnia, but a desire not to be touched was an\r\n indication of it._”\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_, the witness said—\r\n\r\n “_There are several cases in which persons labouring under strychnia\r\n had desired to be rubbed._ Parts of the body might fall on the floor\r\n as well as the blood.\r\n\r\n “_By a Juror._—If strychnia were put in the medicine it would not\r\n alter the colour of it, it might have left a powdery deposit. I never\r\n knew a case of hysteria cause death with such external appearances as\r\n in Mrs. Dove’s case.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Thomas Nunneley_, professor of surgery in the Leeds College of\r\nMedicine, who was examined in Palmer’s case on behalf of that prisoner,\r\nand then maintained that if Cook had been poisoned by strychnia it\r\nwould have been found in his body by the chemical and other tests as\r\nlate as the sixth day after his death, confirmed the statements in the\r\njoint report, and the opinion of Mr. Morley, that Mrs. Dove had died\r\nfrom the effects of strychnia. His experiments on strychnia in the\r\ncases of animals had been carried on for over thirty years, and he was\r\nof opinion that, “though he should not have anticipated the improvement\r\nspoken of on the Saturday, yet that it was not inconsistent with her\r\nhaving taken strychnia on the Friday.” On _cross-examination_ by Mr.\r\nBliss, he gave the following evidence:—\r\n\r\n “I found nothing on dissection that could not be referred to the\r\n strychnia taken on the Saturday night—the intensity of that attack\r\n might have produced the appearances in the brain and lungs. Hysteria\r\n will simulate the appearances of other diseases, and among them of\r\n tetanus. I did not examine the fæces and tissues of the body, but\r\n I should expect to find strychnia in the tissues if taken six days\r\n before. My attention was not called to its having been taken before\r\n Saturday, but even if it had I think I should have found it. This case\r\n and the one in London (Palmer’s) have advanced our knowledge in the\r\n discovery of this poison far beyond what it was before. _It accords\r\n with my experience that a person suffering from strychnia would not\r\n bear to be rubbed._”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined._—“I attribute the symptoms exhibited before Saturday\r\n to strychnia. They are not so in accordance with any disease as with\r\n strychnia.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Christison_, the eminent writer on poisons, also agreed with Mr.\r\nMorley and Mr. Nunneley as to the cause of the symptoms. He admitted\r\nthat “it was just possible to attribute them to hysteria, but had never\r\nseen such a combination of symptoms in an hysteric case. He thought it\r\nwas unusual for a person to be insensible before death in a case of\r\nstrychnia, but he had seen it lately in the case of an animal killed by\r\nthat poison—the symptoms were exactly those which would be produced by\r\nan overdose of strychnia in the prior attacks.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Hobson_, who had seen the deceased with Mr. Morley a few minutes\r\nafter her death, “saw nothing either in her countenance or position\r\nthat he thought particular, and admitted that all the symptoms\r\ndescribed before those of Saturday might be accounted for in an\r\naggravated form of hysteria, but would not expect a person who suffered\r\nunder such a form of hysteria to be conscious, nor did he attribute\r\nthese symptoms to that disease.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Teal_, who had been in practice in Leeds for thirty-four years,\r\nagreed “in the symptoms being entirely in accord with strychnia, and\r\nthough he had seen hysteria simulate strychnism, he had never seen it\r\nentirely resemble the entire group of symptoms represented in this\r\ncase; had he heard only of the symptoms before Saturday, he should\r\nhave considered them in strict accordance with the effects of that\r\npoison; and even if he had heard of hysteric symptoms before, he\r\nshould have suspected strychnia, but would not deny the possibility of\r\ntheir being consistent with hysteria.” In reply to a juryman, he added\r\nthe following evidence on the probable reason for the state of the\r\nprisoner’s mind:—\r\n\r\n “Excessive drinking without producing _delirium tremens_ might cause\r\n the conduct of the prisoner, described by Harrison,[81] as to spirits\r\n and noises. He might have any delusions when under the influence of\r\n drink, but when sober such a man might be sound in mind and without\r\n delusions, and when partially drunk might have delusions without\r\n suffering under _delirium tremens_.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Richard Hey_, who had been in practice in York for\r\ntwenty-seven years, and concurred with the other medical men, on\r\n_cross-examination_, said—\r\n\r\n “I have had experience in hysteria, and have seen cases in which many\r\n of the symptoms would be the same as those described. The freedom from\r\n affection of the brain would lead me to suspect it to be strychnia.\r\n I think the violent twitchings and spasms, and the extreme pain they\r\n produced, would make a very marked distinction from the effects of\r\n hysteria. I have never seen instances of screaming out from pain in\r\n hysteria. I have heard of screaming out. They complain of pain, but\r\n not violent pain. _The spasm consequent on strychnia would, I imagine,\r\n induce a patient to be rubbed as in ordinary spasms and cramp, but\r\n I never saw spasms so intense as in those spoken of in strychnia.\r\n One of the most marked symptoms in strychnia, in aggravated cases,\r\n is not being able to bear to be touched, but it is not so in slight\r\n attacks._” _Re-examined._—“I never knew touching or walking across\r\n a room not bearable in hysteria, or pain in the jaws, or all these\r\n things combined in hysteria.”\r\n\r\nThe last witness called by the prosecution, _Mr. William Hey_, who\r\nhad been in practice in Leeds for thirty-seven years, was equally of\r\nopinion that the symptoms were inconsistent with any known disease, but\r\nconsistent with the effects of strychnia, and with nothing else. “Had\r\nhe heard only the evidence of the symptoms down to Friday night, her\r\nhysterical temperament, and her recovery on the Saturday, he should not\r\nhave attributed them to hysteria, but he should have thought it a most\r\nextraordinary case.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER’S ACTIONS AND STATEMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the acts and statements of the prisoner reported in\r\nthe “Early Life of the Prisoner” and the evidence already given,\r\n_Miss Fisher_ deposed to his very violent threats against his wife,\r\nespecially when in liquor; his telling her on one occasion “to mind\r\nher own business, or he would do her job for her”; his threatening her\r\nwith a knife and striking her, and telling her “he would give her a\r\npill”; and to his wife saying, in his presence, “If I should die, it\r\nis my wish, Elizabeth, that you should tell my friends to have my body\r\nexamined”; to his writing a letter to the witchman Harrison, asking him\r\n“to torment his wife when at Manchester, as she was not a right woman”;\r\nand telling the witness that Harrison had told him that his wife’s\r\ndays would end in February. He also told another witness (_Elizabeth\r\nThornhill_, a charwoman) that Harrison had told him that his wife would\r\nnot live long, and that he would marry the lady next door (Mrs. Witham).\r\n\r\nWhilst the inquest was proceeding he asked Mrs. Witham how it was\r\ngoing on, and when she said to him, “It is a very suspicious thing\r\nthat you gave her the medicine at eight o’clock and that she became\r\nill a quarter of an hour after,” he replied, “If they ask me if I gave\r\nthe medicine, I shall say I did not; and if they ask if she took it\r\nherself, I shall say I do not know.”\r\n\r\nTo _Margaret Gray_, another witness, he stated on the Friday that\r\nhis wife was ill of spasms, and he did not think she would live over\r\nSaturday night.\r\n\r\nTo _Mary Hicks_ he more than once stated that he was sure his wife\r\nwould die, and that Mr. Morley would want a _post mortem_ examination,\r\nas he did in his father’s case, but that he would object to it, as\r\nhe had promised his wife to do; that he should probably soon marry\r\nagain; and when Mrs. Hicks told him to go back, as his wife might have\r\nanother attack, he said she would not until half-past ten or eleven,\r\nand made no reply when again asked if the attacks were periodical. On\r\nthe Sunday morning after his wife’s death, he told this witness that\r\nthere was to be an inquest, and when she asked why, said, “Oh, we live\r\nin a bad neighbourhood, and have not lived happily together. It is all\r\nnonsense.” To the Rev. H. T. Sturgeon, the clergyman of Burley, whom he\r\nasked to visit his wife, and to whom he professed to be very anxious\r\nabout her spiritual welfare, he assigned as his reason for not calling\r\nin further advice (as recommended by Mr. Morley) his fear of offending\r\nthat gentleman. To a man of the name of _Rose_, a baker, whose name\r\neven he did not know, and whom he met by accident in a dram shop on\r\nthe Thursday before his wife’s death, he said that he thought his wife\r\nwould die, and told him “not to come to him till he saw her death in\r\nthe paper, and then, if he lighted on a woman that would suit him, to\r\nbring her down to his house, as he could not do without one if his wife\r\ndied.”\r\n\r\nTo _Harrison_, the watchman, on the Thursday after his wife’s death,\r\nwhen giving him a card for her funeral, he said there was an inquest\r\non her. When Harrison asked why, the prisoner said, “Can they detect\r\na grain or a grain and a half of strychnia?” “Why,” replied Harrison,\r\n“have you given her any?” “No,” replied Dove; “but I got some of\r\nMorley’s man to kill cats, and some might have been spilt and she have\r\ngot it.” Again Harrison saw him the next day, when he said, “Mr. Morley\r\nhas told me they have found poison in my wife. Could they take me if I\r\ngo back?” “I should,” replied Harrison. “If you are innocent, go back;\r\nwhat occasion have you to be frightened? They will not take you if you\r\nare innocent,” and Dove then went away.\r\n\r\nTo his wife’s mother, _Mrs. Jenkins_, who came to his house after her\r\ndaughter’s death, he said at breakfast on the Friday, the day of the\r\nadjourned inquest, “Do you know that a sprinkle of oil of almonds\r\nwill kill a person? Arsenic you can detect in a body after 20 years.\r\nBelladonna you cannot; one is a mineral, the other a vegetable. There\r\nis a poison like this”—taking up a piece of salt—“in a man you can\r\ndetect it, in a woman you cannot.” He told her also that he could not\r\nthink but that he should marry again. When he talked about the poisons\r\nanother person, a _Mrs. Risdon_, was present.\r\n\r\nTo _Mr. Scarth_, a pupil of Mr. Morley’s, who, in consequence of the\r\nlatter’s engagement, was the first to see her on the 25th of February,\r\nhe put the question whether Mr. Morley would require a _post mortem_\r\nexamination if his wife died. Scarth replied that Mr. Morley generally\r\ndid on all his patients who died suddenly, when the prisoner said, “I\r\nwill not consent.” “Probably,” said Scarth, “as you did when your\r\nfather died.” “His wife,” replied Dove, “would not consent.”\r\n\r\nOn the close of the case for the prosecution, Mr. Bliss called on the\r\ncounsel to put into the box the remainder of the witnesses whose names\r\nwere on the back of the bill, and Mr. Hardy, in the absence of his\r\nleader, declining to take this responsibility, Baron Bramwell, on the\r\nauthority of the case of _R._ v. _Woodhead_, ruled that the prosecutor\r\nneed not do so, but was bound to have the witnesses in Court so that\r\nthey might, if required, be called by the defence.[82]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nThough the defence of the prisoner was mainly rested on the question\r\nof his sanity, Mr. Bliss urged on the jury that the circumstantial\r\nevidence against him was inconclusive, turning the openness of the\r\nprisoner’s acts and conversations, and his attention to his wife during\r\nher attacks, to the best advantage. On the question of his sanity, in\r\naddition to the mischievous and cruel acts that had been elicited in\r\ncross-examination, he cited as further proof his belief in witchcraft\r\nand his frequent consultations with the witchman Harrison, and his\r\nrequest to that person to torment his wife, professedly to force her\r\nto return to his bed. The witchman, said counsel, not contemplating\r\nthe murderous result, encouraged him, and held out such promises of\r\nfuture happiness that the desire ripened into practice, and the wife\r\nwas murdered. Even after detection was inevitable, the confidence of\r\nthe dupe remained unimpaired, and he firmly believed that the witchman\r\ncould rescue him from his doom. As a proof of this insane belief the\r\nfollowing letter written in his own blood, which had been found in his\r\npocket when in jail, was read:—\r\n\r\n “Dear Devil,—If you will get me clear at the assizes, and let me\r\n have the enjoyment of life, wealth, tobacco, more food and better, and\r\n my wishes granted till I am sixty, come to me to-night. I remain, your\r\n faithful subject,\r\n\r\n  “WILLIAM DOVE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nIn support of the plea of insanity, in addition to the witnesses\r\nalready referred to in the introduction to this case, three medical\r\nwitnesses of tried experience in lunacy, _Dr. Caleb Williams_ (for 30\r\nyears the medical attendant at the York Asylum), _Dr. Pyeman Smith_ (of\r\nthe Leeds Lunatic Asylum), and _Mr. John Kitchen_ (of The Retreat, at\r\nYork), were called for the defence, whose evidence, it is only fair,\r\nshould be given in some detail.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Williams_, who had been in Court during the whole trial, and had\r\nalso examined the prisoner with _Mr. Kitchen_ a few days before the\r\ntrial, was decidedly of opinion, from the evidence he had heard, that\r\nthe prisoner was of unsound mind, and that his violent emotions and his\r\nbelief in supernatural agency were indications of it.\r\n\r\n “Taking into account,” said the witness, “that he had written and\r\n said similar things before about selling his soul to the devil, I\r\n think that his letter to the devil was not simulated. It appears to\r\n be written with blood. I had conversation with him about that letter\r\n when I saw him, and he told me it was written under satanic influence.\r\n The result of that conversation was that, in my opinion, it was not\r\n simulated. I have no doubt that his illusion, that he had sold himself\r\n to the devil, was a real one. I believe his incantations spoken of\r\n were connected with his belief in supernatural agency; and I think\r\n his saying that he had put a spell on the steward arose from the same\r\n belief.[83] The letter to his schoolmaster, in which he declared his\r\n sanity, is very like what is done by insane persons—they declare they\r\n are sane. His talking to various persons about strychnia showed the\r\n weakness of his mind. The effect of drink on a lunatic are to make\r\n him violent and dangerous. Persons liable to insanity would exhibit\r\n a tendency and inclination to drink. _I think from what I have heard\r\n he has not the power of controlling his emotions and passions. None\r\n of them at all times.[84] There would be periods when he would have\r\n control over some._ The circumstance of his shooting the cat showed an\r\n uncontrollable impulse to injure or take life; and seeing it was not\r\n expended in injuring the man, he shot the cat. The effect of confining\r\n a person for several weeks on strictly sober diet, who has before been\r\n subject to get drunk, would be to reduce him to a calm condition.\r\n The Castle diet is sober (Dove’s prison). _From all I have heard\r\n and seen, I consider his powers of mind, during the fatal week were\r\n probably influenced by his notions regarding supernatural agency, and\r\n that consequently he was the subject of a delusion. During that week,\r\n labouring under such delusions, he might retain his power of adapting\r\n means to an end, and of judging of the consequences. He could not\r\n under those delusions have the power of resisting any impulse._”\r\n\r\n_On cross-examination_ by Mr. Overend, after repudiating the notion\r\nthat his evidence was tinged by religious objections to capital\r\npunishment, the witness said:—\r\n\r\n “I should not call administering poison five or six times an\r\n _impulse_, but a _propensity_—an uncontrollable _propensity_ to\r\n destroy life, and give pain. For the time it would be a permanent\r\n condition of the mind, and might select the special object, and\r\n constantly seek opportunities of carrying out the _propensity_.\r\n _I think a person with such a propensity would not know that he\r\n was doing wrong. I think he might fear the consequences, and know\r\n that punishment would follow. He would know, probably, that he was\r\n breaking the law. I say that, because he would have a very incorrect\r\n appreciation of right and wrong. He would not know at the time that he\r\n would be hanged. I found that opinion on the occupation of the mind\r\n by the insane propensity. It is uncertain whether he would know it\r\n before he did it. He might after he had done it._ He might do a murder\r\n secretly, because he could not otherwise do it. A _propensity_ of that\r\n kind generally acts without a motive. One of the peculiarities is that\r\n a person seeks no escape: in certain cases acknowledges his crime.\r\n The _propensity may come on suddenly: an impulse comes on suddenly—a\r\n propensity more frequently comes on slowly, and starts from a\r\n considerable time_. If a man gives way to his passions, and commits\r\n a rape, I call that a _vice_, and not a _propensity_. Supposing a\r\n cruel man, who wishes to get rid of his wife, quarrels with her, in\r\n the abstract that is a _vice_. Supposing a man to have taken every\r\n precaution against discovery, and pains to procure poison for his\r\n wife, and to prepare for her death, I should think that a _vice_, and\r\n not a _delusion_. Supposing a man of cruel disposition had formed a\r\n dislike to his wife, and wanted to get rid of her, and had nursed that\r\n dislike into a _propensity_ to kill. I should call that _an insane\r\n propensity_. I don’t say that every man who dislikes his wife, and\r\n wishes to get rid of her, is insane. When he acquires the propensity\r\n to kill, and cannot control it, he is insane.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“If a person lived with his wife, hated her, and\r\n determined to, and did kill her, what is the difference between\r\n that determination which is _vice_, and that _propensity_ which is\r\n _insanity_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“The prisoner’s history would be required to determine\r\n whether it was _vice_ or _insanity_.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Supposing a man was determined to kill his wife,\r\n and he nurses the thought for six months, till the desire becomes\r\n uncontrollable, when does the desire become insanity?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“When by nourishing such an idea, the mind becomes\r\n diseased, and he cannot control his acts—that applies to other\r\n things.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“If a man dwells on the possession of a woman till he\r\n cannot control his desire, would that be _vice_ or _insanity_?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It might be insanity, and might apply to rape.[85]\r\n In insanity there is a tendency to thieve. Theft is one of the\r\n indications of moral insanity; and a man may desire to possess\r\n another man’s goods, till he cannot control his acts. He is then\r\n insane. If a man permits himself to indulge a passion till he becomes\r\n uncontrollable, that is _moral insanity_, and he is not responsible.\r\n Consulting a sorcerer, and all superstitious beliefs, are indications\r\n of a weak mind. Belief in clairvoyance and dreams is not necessarily\r\n an indication of insanity. A belief in spiritual rappings, I should\r\n infer, was an indication of a weak mind. Talking to persons about\r\n strychnia, and his wife’s death, I think indicated a feeble state of\r\n mind.”\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_, _Dr. Williams_ said—\r\n\r\n “Imitativeness is one of the characteristics of insanity, and\r\n hearing strychnia and Palmer’s trial very much talked about would be\r\n very likely, in a weak mind, to produce imitation. You must know\r\n a man’s history before you can say whether his acts proceed from\r\n vice or insanity. Madness very frequently developes itself in great\r\n cunning and foresightedness when reasoning on false premises. I have\r\n frequently known insane persons to attempt to escape from the asylum,\r\n and to have shown great cleverness in their preparations for it\r\n extending over several days.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Suppose you had heard the case of a man put to you who\r\n wished to get rid of his wife, and had from his childhood displayed\r\n cruelty of disposition—had threatened to shoot his father; said he\r\n heard supernatural noises, sometimes treated his wife kindly, and\r\n sometimes cried like no other man, would you have any doubt that he\r\n was insane?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No! and not fit to be at large. I should have no\r\n difficulty, as a medical man, in certifying that he was a lunatic.\r\n Lunatics have often displayed great ingenuity in committing theft and\r\n concealing it. The passion of lust frequently becomes a disease of\r\n the mind. When the prisoner gave his cows linseed to take one night,\r\n to fatten them for market the next morning, that I should deem an\r\n indication of an unsound mind.”\r\n\r\n_In reply to questions by the Judge_, the witness said:—\r\n\r\n _”It would require a longer period than a month to establish disease\r\n and an uncontrollable propensity to commit a crime. If a man committed\r\n a crime, having thought of it for a month, I should not say he was\r\n of unsound mind. The difference would depend on length of time.\r\n Some men’s minds, previously weak, would take a shorter time, and\r\n very exciting causes would shorten the time; but there must be an\r\n appreciable period, and an interval for the mind to pass into a morbid\r\n condition from the continual contemplation of one object._ The period\r\n is necessarily very uncertain, from the variable effect of emotions\r\n and circumstances on the mind.”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“Suppose, at the time when he shot the cat, a policeman\r\n had come in, would he have shot it?”[86]\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No. The presence of the policeman would probably have\r\n controlled him; he would probably have expended the impulse on some\r\n person or something else. Unless the person is exceedingly violent,\r\n the presence of a policeman would have some influence to control him.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“_Whenever a man commits a crime, is it because he is\r\n uncontrolled by existing circumstances?_”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“_It is._”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“_Then what is the difference between such a man and the\r\n case you put?_”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“_In the case I put the impulse is uncontrollable, because\r\n his mind would be so occupied with his purpose._”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“Is it true of everybody, whether sane or insane, that\r\n when intent on an act they forget the consequences?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“An insane man would be more likely to forget consequences.\r\n Sane and insane persons would talk about occurrences. How and what\r\n they talked about would depend on their judgment.”\r\n\r\nThe witness wished to say with regard to the question as to shooting\r\nthe cat, that he thought the impulse of destruction was so strong\r\nat the time, that he could not control it, and must have shot\r\nsomething.[87]\r\n\r\n_Dr. Pyeman Smith_, the proprietor of a private lunatic asylum at\r\nLeeds for the past 15 years, though, from what he had heard and seen,\r\nhe was prepared to declare that Dove was of unsound mind during the\r\nfatal week, and had been so for the last 20 years, admitted, on\r\n_cross-examination_, that he did know right from wrong during that\r\nperiod. He, however, _on re-examination_, qualified this admission.\r\n\r\n “A decided lunatic,” said the witness, “very often knows right from\r\n wrong, and yet may be regardless of any consequences from his acts.\r\n _He may be utterly unable to refrain from doing an act, though he knew\r\n it was wrong. I cannot say the prisoner was utterly unable to refrain\r\n from wrong during the fatal week. Circumstances might enable him to\r\n refrain—other circumstances._”\r\n\r\n _To the Judge._—“Not a greater degree of punishment. I have already\r\n said he was entirely regardless of circumstances.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bliss_ objected to this line of examination by the judge.\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“I am entitled to, and in my opinion bound to, and I\r\n will put the questions.”\r\n\r\n_Witness_ then continued—\r\n\r\n “_Not possessing the poison would be a circumstance which would have\r\n prevented him._ I believe, during the week, it was from unsoundness of\r\n mind that he was regardless of consequences.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. John Kitchen_, superintendent of The Retreat at York, where the\r\npatients averaged a hundred, also agreed with the previous medical\r\nwitnesses, that Dove was of unsound mind during the fatal week. He,\r\nhowever, admitted that “_during that period he knew right from wrong,\r\nhad some knowledge of the difference—some knowledge that he was\r\ncommitting murder—and that if found out he would be punished_.” This\r\nadmission he sought to explain away, _on re-examination_, protesting\r\nthat what he meant was “that Dove knew he was killing his wife, but did\r\nnot know he was doing a wrong act—that he would know in proportion as\r\nhe knew the difference between right and wrong.”\r\n\r\n _Question by a juryman._—“Do you adopt the theory of Dr. Smith as to\r\n irresistible propensity in mania?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“In general terms I do.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you adopt it in this case?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I do not. I account for the murder, if he committed it,\r\n on different principles. We have a man of deficient mental powers;\r\n besides that he is insane; he is liable to do any absurd, cruel, or\r\n vicious or irrational action that presented itself to his mind, as\r\n his life shows. Supposing him to be insane, I should apply the term\r\n _vicious_ or _malignant_ to him. We have heard, in evidence, that\r\n he was brought up by pious parents, put to the best schools, and\r\n was unable to receive the smallest amount of education. We see him\r\n carried away to do the most foolish things. Where he loves, he loves\r\n with a foolish intensity; and where he hates, he hates with a foolish\r\n malignity: and if a woman puts herself into the power of such a man as\r\n his wife, what has happened is just what might have been expected.”\r\n\r\n _To Mr. Overend._—“_I think he knew right from wrong—that it was\r\n wrong to steal or murder._ If he murdered, I should expect him to\r\n deny it in that form of insanity. In one form of insanity, impulsive\r\n madness, they own their crime. This case was only partly impulsive,\r\n and I should not expect him to divulge it. If he thought of this crime\r\n before he committed it, he would know it was wrong. He probably would\r\n learn it was wrong in his childhood. It is impossible to say when he\r\n committed the act he knew it was wrong. I don’t know when he would\r\n know it was wrong. I can give no opinion about it.”\r\n\r\n_On re-examination_, he said:—\r\n\r\n “There are dangerous wards in some asylums, but I should not expect to\r\n find the greatest number of impulsive cases in that ward. Sometimes\r\n impulsive lunatics are dangerous. The keepers have an influence over\r\n them—a mental influence. They formerly worked on their fears, and\r\n thus kept patients under control. There is a madness which consists in\r\n a _propensity_ to kill. If a stranger was left with such a one in a\r\n room alone, I should expect him to exercise his _propensity_ and kill\r\n him; and yet, probably, that patient would yield his keeper obedience.\r\n Probably the fear of some chastisement would induce fear of his\r\n keeper.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGE’S CHARGE.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of Baron Bramwell’s charge was necessarily\r\noccupied by reading over and commenting on the evidence produced\r\nby the prosecution—that the death of the wife had been due to the\r\nadministration of strychnia, and that the prisoner had opportunities\r\nof administering it. The evidence on these points has been already\r\nso fully reported that it is needless to give this portion of his\r\nexhaustive summing-up. His remarks on the rule of law on the plea of\r\ninsanity, and on the nature of the insanity suggested by the medical\r\nwitnesses, are too valuable to be omitted.\r\n\r\n “The rules of law,” said the learned Baron, “are that it must be\r\n clearly proved that, at the time of committing the act, the party\r\n accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of\r\n the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was\r\n doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing wrong.\r\n If the accused was conscious of the act he did, he is punishable;\r\n and what you have to consider is, had he sufficient degree of sanity\r\n to know he was doing wrong? With respect to delusions the law is the\r\n same. According to the law, as I lay it down to you on the highest\r\n authority, to exempt a man from the penal consequence of his act, the\r\n act being contrary to the law, you must be of opinion that at the\r\n time he did the act he was not conscious that it was one he ought not\r\n to do; for if he was conscious that it was contrary to law, he is\r\n punishable. You must be satisfied that he had not a sufficient degree\r\n of reason to know that he was doing an act that was wrong—of course\r\n that means an act prohibited by law: because a man might imagine that\r\n the thing was a right thing to do, and it might not be contrary to\r\n law. He might think it right to take from the rich and give to the\r\n poor. But if he did it, not knowing it was wrong, he must not know\r\n that the thing which he did was what the law would punish him for. It\r\n is not necessary for me to justify the law, or for you to approve it.\r\n We have only to administer it. Don’t, however, suppose for a moment\r\n that I doubt the reasonableness of it.\r\n\r\n “Let me put a case to you. A man labours under a delusion. He thinks\r\n I have done him wrong—have traduced his character. He waylays and\r\n murders me. Why should he be acquitted? Suppose he was wronged, that\r\n would not justify his taking away my life. Suppose, again, a person\r\n imagined some part of his person to be made of glass, or had swallowed\r\n something, or got something wrong in his inside. Imagine that man\r\n deliberately waylaying a person, knowing that he possessed property,\r\n to take it from him, and afterwards to conceal what he had done, and\r\n to act in every other respect as a rational man. Why should he be held\r\n irresponsible for this because he was irrational in other respects?\r\n\r\n “Why should punishment be administered at all? It was not inflicted\r\n on a man who had committed a crime because he had inflicted that upon\r\n others, but in order to hold out an example to deter other people.\r\n If you punish an insane man, you hold out no example, because you are\r\n punishing a man who thinks he is doing right. But take the case of a\r\n man who is labouring under a delusion—under an evil propensity. If\r\n you punish him when he does wrong, or any other person with a similar\r\n propensity to commit that offence, and he knows, that when he indulged\r\n in it, or that when somebody else did, he was punished for it, that\r\n will deter him from repeating or from doing that act. Take the case\r\n of a man who has a strong propensity to thieve—a strong desire on\r\n him to do it; his intellect not very strong, and he knows that he is\r\n punished if he does such an act: do not you think, if he is punished,\r\n it will deter him from doing it again? There cannot be a doubt that it\r\n is so; and if you were to announce to all the world, that a man who\r\n has a strong propensity to an evil, that a person in his condition,\r\n shall not be punished, you take away from such persons the only thing\r\n that would deter them from committing the evil. Take a man of a weak\r\n mind and strong animal propensities, and it will not deter him from\r\n committing such an act.”\r\n\r\nAgain, after going carefully through the evidence in the case, and\r\npointing out the application of the different classes of proofs, the\r\nlearned Baron said that “he thought none of the instances of strange\r\nconduct adduced when the prisoner was a boy evidence of insanity more\r\nthan might be found in the conduct of a perverse, ill-conducted boy;”\r\nand contrasted the opinions of the witnesses as to his being almost an\r\nidiot with the letters written by him, which exhibited no traces of\r\nmental incapacity.[88] In commenting on the opinions of the medical men\r\nof experience in insanity, he adopted the judgment of Dr. Lushington\r\nin the Dyce Sombre case, “that the facts to which they depose, and not\r\ntheir opinions alone, were of weight;” and added “that he sincerely\r\nbelieved that the jury were as capable of judging as these mad\r\ndoctors.”\r\n\r\n “Two of them,” continued the learned judge, “were of opinion that\r\n the contemplation of a crime constituted insanity, if it were only\r\n contemplated enough. Then it was said that a man who had a propensity\r\n to vice, to cruelty, to crime, was insane. Take the case of a man\r\n found guilty at these assizes of a crime. It is found that he has\r\n twice been convicted before and in prison half a dozen times, and\r\n that he has a general propensity to commit crime. In such a case,\r\n why should not Dr. Williams come forward and say, “You are wrong.\r\n He is insane; you ought not to punish him.” If they believed these\r\n experts you would take away protection from the community, because\r\n they would have a check less to prevent the commission of crime. It\r\n would be affectation in him to say that he did not set a value on this\r\n scientific evidence. But he would rather take his own independent\r\n opinion, than that of others, on the facts. But it was not for him to\r\n do more than comment, and for the jury to judge of its value—of the\r\n conduct of the prisoner, of his letters, and of the arguments before\r\n them.”\r\n\r\nAfter a brief consideration the jury returned a verdict of “guilty, but\r\nrecommended him to mercy on the ground of his defective intellect.”\r\nSentence of death was passed on him, and he was executed at York.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER’S CONFESSIONS.\r\n\r\nA day or two before his execution Dove dictated two long and\r\nextraordinary statements of his connection with the “Witchman,” and\r\nthe part played in the tragedy by this dangerous man, which contrast\r\nstrongly with the evidence given by Harrison himself, and probably\r\ndisclose facts which that person was glad to conceal at the time of his\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these statements he details his earlier interviews with\r\nthe “Witchman” on the subjects of recovering lost cattle, removing\r\nstrange noises from his house, and the bewitching of his live stock,\r\nin which Harrison appears to have played off on him the common tricks\r\nof his trade. His confidence in this fellow was unfortunately largely\r\nincreased by his prophecying that Dove’s father would die before a\r\ncertain Christmas Day—he died on Christmas Eve—and led him to\r\nconsult the “Witchman” about his wife when he first conceived his\r\nviolent hatred towards her.\r\n\r\n “About August, 1855,” he says, “I had some unpleasantness with my\r\n wife, and went over to Harrison at Leeds, told him of it, and he\r\n promised to make it all right. He told me I must let him know by\r\n letter how things went on. In two days after this I wrote him that my\r\n wife was no better, and that he must do something to make peace. I\r\n sent this by Fisher, a porter at the railway station, to post. Mrs.\r\n Dove knew I had written, but not what about. She therefore sent the\r\n servant to Fisher, got back the letter, took out what I had written,\r\n and put in a blank sheet.[89] I did not know this at the time, but,\r\n hearing some whispering, wrote another letter, and posted it myself\r\n about two o’clock. At three I went myself to Harrison, who told me\r\n he had received a blank sheet, and asked why, and I told him. I then\r\n informed him of the unpleasantness and unhappiness with my wife, and\r\n he said ‘You will never have happiness till she is out of the way.’\r\n I said ‘How do you know that.’ He said ‘Come upstairs and I’ll tell\r\n you, for I’ve got your nativity marked out.’ [Upstairs he showed him\r\n a paper with the signs of the Zodiac, and hieroglyphical forms and\r\n numbers, which he describes at length.] Harrison then read out of a\r\n book my destiny. Between twenty-seven and thirty-two all would go\r\n against me. I should have nothing but misfortunes; that at thirty-two\r\n the sun and moon would come into conjunction, and then everything\r\n would be in my favour; that at thirty-two I should lose my wife, marry\r\n again, and have a child, and an addition to my fortune; and that for\r\n my sake he did not care how soon it was here, for until then I should\r\n never be a happy man; that after ‘thirty-two’ everything would go well\r\n for a few years. He made other remarks as to different periods of my\r\n life.”\r\n\r\nThen follow the usual enquiries about the kind of person that was to be\r\nhis second wife.\r\n\r\n “I saw Harrison again in November about my wife’s temper. He said\r\n never mind, ‘she will die before the end of February or March, I am\r\n not certain which.’ When he told me my wife would die soon I said\r\n ‘You have told me before she would die at thirty-two.’ He replied\r\n ‘Before thirty-two, but I did not say how much before.’ In a few days\r\n afterwards (after December 21) I went to the ‘New Cross Inn,’ and\r\n Harrison came in with a newspaper and read about Palmer’s case. I then\r\n asked him whether strychnia could be detected, and he said ‘No, nor\r\n any other vegetable poison.’ I then said ‘What other vegetable poisons\r\n are there that cannot be detected? and he said ‘Digitalis, belladonna,\r\n particularly if crystallised; he could not remember more then.’ I then\r\n asked him to get or make me some strychnia, as we were much annoyed in\r\n our new house with cats, but he refused. I told him I would get some\r\n elsewhere.\r\n\r\n “I went to him again in January last about my wife. I told him about\r\n my wife’s temper and her being poorly then, and he again said, ‘She\r\n won’t live long; she will never get better. As I told you before, she\r\n will die in February.’\r\n\r\n “I had no further communication with Harrison until the 6th of March,\r\n when I sent for him to the ‘New Cross Inn,’ and told him my wife had\r\n died, and that an inquest was to be held. He asked, ‘Why?’ I said,\r\n ‘My wife died very suddenly, and Mr. Morley cannot account for it,\r\n and it is known that I had strychnia in the house. Mr. Morley thinks\r\n some may have been spilt, and my wife got at it accidentally.’ I then\r\n said, ‘You told me strychnia could not be detected, but I have seen\r\n in the _Materia Medica_ that it can;[90] what is your opinion now?\r\n Can a grain to a grain and a half be detected, for there is a great\r\n difference on the subject? Professor Taylor says it cannot be detected\r\n twenty-four hours after death in the human body.’ Harrison said,\r\n ‘What, have you poisoned your wife?’ I replied, ‘No, I should be very\r\n sorry to.’ Nothing more passed then.\r\n\r\n “On Friday, the 7th, whilst the inquest was going on, I went to the\r\n back door of Harrison’s house, about 3 P.M., and said to him ‘that\r\n several witnesses had been called, and I was suspected of poisoning my\r\n wife,’ and added, ‘How will the case go?’ He said, ‘It will be a very\r\n difficult case, but I can get you out.’ I said, ‘You only say you can;\r\n but tell me, will you?’ and he replied, ‘Set yourself altogether at\r\n rest; I will.’”\r\n\r\nIn the _second_ statement he gives details of his administration of the\r\nstrychnia, declaring that even when he got the second portion of that\r\npoison from Mr. Morley’s pupil he had no intention of poisoning his\r\nwife, but only intended it for the cats. His first attempt was with the\r\njelly his sister Jane had sent, of which, it may be remembered, the\r\nwife, on the score of its bitterness, took only a spoonful. He then\r\ngoes on:—\r\n\r\n “On the Saturday, after Fisher left,[91] I took the paper containing\r\n the strychnia out of my razor-case and put it in my waistcoat-pocket,\r\n and then went to my mother’s house. In the afternoon I had previously\r\n called at Mr. Morley’s for my wife’s medicine. It was an effervescing\r\n draught, in two bottles. At my mother’s that evening I took the cork\r\n out of one of the bottles and touched the wet end of it with the\r\n strychnia. On that Saturday evening my wife took some of the draught\r\n in Mrs. Witham’s presence. Mrs. Witham tasted it, and said it tasted\r\n bitter. The draught was not shaken that night before taken. My wife\r\n did not suffer from the effects at all. On my way from my mother’s\r\n that night I threw away the remainder of the strychnia. I cannot tell\r\n you the feelings of my mind when I put the strychnia into the jelly\r\n and the mixture. I did not think at the moment as to its effects and\r\n consequences. On the Sunday following, which was the 24th of February,\r\n I went to the surgery; and there being no person there at the time,\r\n I took perhaps ten grains of strychnia and folded them in paper, and\r\n when I got home placed it in the stable. On the Monday morning I\r\n gave my wife her medicine—the effervescent mixture—about half-past\r\n nine, and at ten she had the attack mentioned by Mrs. Fisher and\r\n Mrs. Witham. At the time she took it she complained very much of the\r\n bitterness, and said she would tell Mr. Morley about it. There were\r\n three or four doses left in the bottle after that draught was taken,\r\n and I broke the bottle in my wife’s presence, fearing Mr. Morley might\r\n taste it. The mixture was changed on the Monday; the mixture then\r\n given was very bitter. On Tuesday night or Wednesday morning I applied\r\n the wet end of the cork of the medicine-bottle to the strychnia, as\r\n before. I think there might be from half to a grain of strychnia on\r\n the cork when I put it into the bottle. I shook the mixture up. There\r\n were only two or three doses in the bottle. I don’t remember my wife\r\n having an attack on the Wednesday. She took her medicine that day.\r\n On Thursday I got another bottle of medicine from Mr. Morley, and I\r\n again applied the wet end of the cork to the strychnia as before.\r\n About the same quantity adhered. The last dose of that medicine was\r\n taken on Friday night about ten, and my wife was taken seriously ill\r\n in half an hour, but she had no arching of the back, as far as I can\r\n remember. Mrs. Fisher is mistaken in that point, but her statement\r\n in other respects is true, I believe. On that Friday night I got\r\n another bottle of medicine from Mr. Morley’s, directed to be taken\r\n four times a day. I did not put any strychnia into that bottle, or\r\n upon its cork. Mrs. Witham gave a dose out of that bottle in the\r\n afternoon of Saturday.[92] The strychnia was in the stable, where I\r\n had first placed it, and there was none in the razor-case on that\r\n day, nor during any part of that week. I was drinking at Sadlefee’s\r\n public-house on that Saturday, and was more or less affected with\r\n drink all that afternoon and evening. About three in the afternoon\r\n I went to the stable and took a grain and a half of strychnia out\r\n of the stable and put it in another paper, which I placed in my\r\n waistcoat-pocket. I put that strychnia into the wine-glass which\r\n contained a little water—I believe the water left in the glass by\r\n Mrs. Witham after giving my wife the third dose in the afternoon, but\r\n I have no recollection as to the time I put the strychnia into the\r\n glass. I gave the mixture in the evening, as stated by Mrs. Witham\r\n and Mrs. Wood in their evidence. I poured the mixture into the glass\r\n which contained the water and strychnia. I did not put the strychnia\r\n into the wine-glass in the presence of Mrs. Witham and Mrs. Wood. I\r\n know that I put it in before, but cannot tell how long before giving\r\n the medicine. I did not, when I gave the medicine on the occasions\r\n mentioned, think of the consequences; but when I saw my wife suffering\r\n on the Saturday night, it flashed across my mind that I had given\r\n her medicine, and that she would die from the effects. I was muddled\r\n before this, and did not know what I was doing. When the thoughts of\r\n her death crossed my mind, I regretted what I had done, and believe\r\n that if Mr. Morley had come in at that moment I should have told him\r\n what I had given her, so that he might have used means to restore her.\r\n I cannot disguise the anguish I felt when I returned from Mr. Morley’s\r\n and found her dead. Palmer’s case first called my attention to\r\n strychnia, but I never should have thought of using that or any other\r\n poison for the purpose of taking my wife’s life but for Harrison, who\r\n was always telling me that I should never have any happiness till my\r\n wife was out of the way.”[93]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF SILAS BARLOW FOR THE WILFUL MURDER OF ELIZA SOPER.\r\n\r\n _Before_ THE HONORABLE MR. JUSTICE DENMAN, _at the_ CENTRAL CRIMINAL\r\n COURT, _November 27, 1876_.\r\n\r\n _For the Prosecution_: Mr. Poland and Mr. Beasley.\r\n\r\n _For the Defence_: Mr. Fulton and Mr. Grubbe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\nTHE prisoner, an engine driver on the South-Western Railway, about a\r\nyear before the trial, on being left a widower, had formed a connection\r\nwith the deceased, who, with their infant, came to lodge at the house\r\nof a Mrs. Wilson, in Leopold Street, Vauxhall, in August, 1876, under\r\nthe name of Smith, where she was occasionally visited by the prisoner,\r\nwho passed as her husband. Apparently they lived together on kindly\r\nterms, and were in fairly comfortable circumstances. On the 3rd of\r\nSeptember the prisoner visited her about half-past eight in the\r\nevening, and stayed an hour. Up to that day the deceased had been in\r\ngood health. As soon, however, as the prisoner had left, she came down\r\nfrom her room, knocked at the landlady’s door, and complained to her\r\nthat she was very sick from the sarsaparilla which he had given her.\r\n“Her lips were white, she was very nervous, and appeared hardly able\r\nto stand,” said Mrs. Wilson. “I had never seen her so before. She went\r\nupstairs, and when I went to bed I went to her. She was retching very\r\nmuch, and sitting in a chair. I then went away. Next morning I saw\r\nher; she came downstairs and said she was very bad—worse. She could\r\nnot stand, and had to lean against the wall. During the day she became\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner came again on the Sunday following, the 10th, at the same\r\ntime as before.\r\n\r\n “The deceased,” said Mrs. Wilson, “was at the street door, talking\r\n to me, with her baby, and in perfect health. They went up into their\r\n room, and in about an hour the prisoner knocked at my room door and\r\n said his wife had had two fits. I ran upstairs and found her lying\r\n across the bed; the prisoner was in the room. She was in a kind of\r\n fit or convulsion. I sent the prisoner for some brandy and water. She\r\n became a little conscious, and taking me by the hand said ‘_Don’t\r\n touch me_.’ She had been unconscious, _but the moment she was touched\r\n she went into convulsions_. _Her feet and hands were clenched, and\r\n she was drawn quite backwards, her back forming an entire arch._ She\r\n was _not conscious_ then. The prisoner was holding her all the time.\r\n About half past ten I sent him for Dr. Miller, who came at once, and\r\n applied mustard plasters, remaining with her about five minutes,\r\n and the prisoner going back with him for medicine. She was slightly\r\n conscious when Dr. Miller came, and more so afterwards. Her feet were\r\n quite _white(?)[94] the toes being drawn backwards to the soles of\r\n the feet_. I did what the doctor told me, but it did not do her any\r\n good. I tried to give her the medicine, but she could not take it,\r\n _and went off in a swoon_. She had licked the spoon. She then had\r\n dreadful convulsions, one in particular, when it took the prisoner\r\n and me to hold her. Her neck was drawn backwards and quite arched.\r\n After that she became quite conscious, and said it was the nasty\r\n sarsaparilla that made her ill. The prisoner said ‘Oh no. I have taken\r\n more of it than you.’ He also said ‘I have given her two pills and\r\n taken two myself.’ She complained of a dreadful pain in her heart,\r\n _and continued unconscious, coming to herself a little at times, but\r\n very slightly_. The convulsions were dreadful, and she died about two\r\n o’clock on the eleventh. She seemed to drop instantly after a dreadful\r\n convulsion. I gave her two doses of the medicine the doctor sent. I\r\n had not seen any sarsaparilla in the room.”\r\n\r\n_On cross-examination_ by Mr. Fulton, after stating that she had never\r\nheard any quarrels between the prisoner and the deceased, she gave the\r\nfollowing further particulars as to the symptoms:—\r\n\r\n “In the evening, when I was called in, her eyes were partly closed\r\n during the convulsions; her breathing very hot (hard?) and at most\r\n suspended; her teeth entirely clenched and also her hands during the\r\n convulsions. She wanted to be sick shortly before her death; her lips\r\n were pale, and remained so until her death. The prisoner tried to move\r\n her, when she became sick, and she went into convulsions. He helped to\r\n hold her, and said he could not imagine what was the matter with her;\r\n seemed distressed, and sat on the bed holding her. To all appearance\r\n he was kind to her but not affectionate. _She was more unconscious\r\n than conscious during the whole time._ About twelve o’clock she\r\n _appeared quite conscious_. She had to move herself so that she\r\n could be sick, and caught hold of the bed head, and then went again\r\n into convulsions. _Virtually she was unconscious the whole time._\r\n Dr. Miller came a second time, and she told him she had had some\r\n fearful fits, but I cannot recollect whether I said anything about the\r\n ‘arching.’ There was none when he saw her, but _her feet were curved_,\r\n and I told him about the ‘shakings,’ I mean the ‘convulsions.’ I\r\n first heard from the coroners officer that she had died of strychnia.\r\n I had previously told him the symptoms attending her death, but\r\n don’t remember telling him of the ‘arching.’ He said there was every\r\n appearance of her having died from strychnia.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_James Miller_, medical assistant at the Vauxhall dispensary, before\r\nthat with Mr. Scott, a general practitioner, and previously an\r\ninsurance agent, gave the following account of the case:—\r\n\r\n “About twenty minutes to eleven on the 10th of September I was called\r\n by the prisoner to his wife, who he said had had two fainting fits.\r\n I found her lying on the bed, dressed, and quite conscious. She lay\r\n very quietly. She said she had severe pain in the legs, and that\r\n she had fainted twice. I asked her if she had complained during the\r\n week. She said only of pains in the head. I found the calves of her\r\n legs very rigid, her feet turned slightly inwards, the toes of each\r\n foot inclined towards the other as she lay, cramp in the lower limbs,\r\n her arms quiet. She beat her breast at times. Her hands were partly\r\n closed, her heart very excited, and her breathing slightly laboured.\r\n Her heart continued excited all the time I was there, about five\r\n minutes. I asked her what she had taken. She said a cup of tea in\r\n the morning and a herring at tea. She said she had pain in her head\r\n all the last week. _I believed she was suffering from epilepsy._\r\n On leaving, the prisoner returned with me; I made up a bottle of\r\n medicine, antispasmodic, which he took away with him. I never saw her\r\n again alive.”\r\n\r\n_On cross-examination_ he said—\r\n\r\n “He did not notice any such ‘arching’ as the witness Wilson spoke\r\n of, nor did she mention it to him as one of the symptoms. Nor should\r\n he call what he saw of the feet ‘arching.’ He had only seen one case\r\n of epilepsy before—that was twelve months ago—and the symptoms in\r\n it were very similar to what he saw in the deceased. He saw the body\r\n immediately after death; there was no ‘arching’ of it then. If there\r\n had been he should have seen it. She was lying, with her clothes on,\r\n on the bed. If there had been any marked rigidity of the body he\r\n should have observed it; that was a quarter of an hour after death.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined_ by Mr. Poland.—“She had her clothes on when he saw her,\r\n and part of her body might have been covered with the bedclothes. In\r\n the case of epilepsy he referred to, the person died in six hours. _He\r\n prescribed no pills, only the mixture._”\r\n\r\nProof was then given of the finding in the prisoner’s room of six\r\nbottles of medicine, a box with two pills,[95] and a packet of powder\r\nin dirty paper, and of their delivery to Dr. Lees, and subsequently to\r\nDr. Bernays for analysis. It was not, however, until suspicions were\r\naroused by other circumstances (the finding of the body of the infant\r\nin the river) that a _post-mortem_ examination was held by Dr. Lees,\r\nand the contents of the stomach and other interior parts of the body\r\nanalysed by him, and subsequently handed to Dr. Bernays for the same\r\npurpose. In one of the bottles Dr. Bernays found a distinct sediment\r\nof Prussian blue, pointing clearly to the use of some vermin killer.\r\nSubsequently two kinds of these dangerous preparations were submitted\r\nto and analysed by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nDr. Lees, M.D., of the Brixton Road, on the 18th of September made a\r\n_post-mortem_ examination of the body in conjunction with a Dr. Lewis.\r\nThey found _no morbid appearances to indicate the cause of death_—the\r\nlimbs were somewhat rigid, the body fairly nourished, and the stomach\r\nshowed no sign of irritant poison.\r\n\r\n “It contained,” said the witness, “six ounces of a thin reddish\r\n fluid. I put the stomach and contents into a jar, and the viscera\r\n into another. I received the bottles from the constable and the paper\r\n of powder, and saw some pills at the inquest. Among the bottles\r\n was one of the larger ones, which appeared to have contained a few\r\n ounces of good sarsaparilla—it was empty and rinsed out. One bottle\r\n contained about two grains of dried powder, adhering to the bottle.\r\n I added to the bottle a few drachms of water, two drachms of spirits\r\n of wine, thirty drops of hydrochloric acid, and two grains of dried\r\n powder. My purpose up to that time was to test for strychnia, but it\r\n was frustrated. What I had done was not sufficient to enable me to\r\n form an opinion. I had previously analysed a portion of a two-ounce\r\n phial, containing half a drachm or thirty drops of a reddish brown\r\n fluid—half a spoonful. I first tested five drops, and obtained clear\r\n evidence of strychnia. I was enabled to separate from the rest a\r\n substance that yielded strychnia. I used three separate tests; the\r\n second time with ten drops, and obtained needle-shaped crystals.\r\n I showed the colour to Dr. Bernays. I did not test the bottle for\r\n any other purpose. I left the rest (five drops) in the bottle and\r\n corked it up. Half a grain of strychnia is a fatal dose. I have\r\n been in practice fourteen years, and am of opinion that if Mrs.\r\n Wilson’s description of the symptoms is correct, they were consistent\r\n with death from strychnia. They only resemble the disease known as\r\n _idiopathic tetanus_. If Mrs. Wilson’s description is correct, the\r\n symptoms were not consistent with anything I know except death by\r\n strychnia—it came on so rapidly. If strychnia were administered in\r\n solution, the symptoms would come on in a very few minutes. _Strychnia\r\n occasionally produces irritation of the stomach._ The symptoms of\r\n poisoning by it are the rapid occurrence of twitchings in the limbs\r\n and rigidity of the muscles of the limbs, _usually commencing in the\r\n lower extremities_; the sense of weight on the chest, the extension of\r\n the spasms to the muscles of the trunk, the arching back of the head,\r\n the intervals of consciousness, the absence of any great difficulty\r\n in swallowing, and death in six hours. Mr. Miller’s evidence is\r\n consistent with death from strychnia.”\r\n\r\n_The cross-examination_ was, as in Mrs. Wilson’s case, directed to the\r\neliciting admissions in favour of the opinion, at first adopted by Mr.\r\nMiller, that the death was due to epilepsy.\r\n\r\n “Leaving out the ‘arching’” (opisthotonos), said the witness, “I\r\n should hesitate to say she died of strychnia; it is a leading symptom,\r\n and also that the intellect was clear at intervals. _Vomiting is not\r\n usual in epilepsy._ It was _eight days_ after death that I examined\r\n the body. There was then _no rigidity beyond what I might expect in\r\n death_. The lungs were congested, the heart flabby and decomposed,\r\n spongy from putrefaction, and containing a little coagulated blood.\r\n Taking the appearances of the whole _post-mortem_ examination, _there\r\n were no marked ones to account for death_.”\r\n\r\nDr. A. J. Bernays, professor of chemistry at St. Thomas’s Hospital,\r\nto whom the bottles and powder found in the room, the jars with the\r\nstomach, intestines, and viscera, and a bottle supposed to contain\r\nvomit,[96] had been handed on the 28th of October, reported the\r\nresults of his analysis of their contents.[97]\r\n\r\n “In the organs (the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, intestines, spleen,\r\n and blood) he found no poison of any kind. The stomach was inflamed,\r\n and there was a _trace of strychnia_, but of no other poison. In one\r\n bottle of medicine, opium, myrrh, but no strychnia, were found, and\r\n in another only peppermint and asafœtida. The powder was innocuous,\r\n consisting of old mustard and fenugreek. In one nearly empty bottle\r\n was found a distinct sediment of Prussian blue, one of the usual\r\n ingredients in ‘vermin powder.’ He was satisfied that what Dr. Lees\r\n showed him on a watch glass was strychnia; on testing, it was found\r\n to contain the 1000th part of a grain. On the 31st of October the\r\n inspector brought two packets labelled _Battle’s Vermin Killer_.\r\n _Poison. Lincoln_—a light blue powder, a threepenny and a sixpenny\r\n packet. The first consisted of fifteen grains, containing wheat flour,\r\n Prussian blue, and crystallised strychnia. The second packet, of the\r\n same composition as the first, weighed thirty grains. The amount\r\n of strychnia was—in the threepenny packet 10·69 per cent., in the\r\n sixpenny packet 10·06 per cent., corresponding to 1·6 grains in the\r\n smaller packet. On the 9th November a threepenny and sixpenny packet\r\n of _Butler’s Gloucestershire Vermin and Insect Killer for killing rats\r\n and mice, &c._, was received, marked poison. The weight of the two\r\n was fifty-six grains. It was a grey powder, containing flour, soot,\r\n and barium carbonate, but no strychnia; but another packet of the\r\n same contained flour, soot, strychnia, but no barium carbonate. These\r\n ‘vermin killers,’ if used at all, should never be made or sold except\r\n by the legitimate pharmaceutists of the country, and under proper\r\n precautions.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Justice Denman._—“A very proper suggestion for the consideration\r\n of the legislature.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Thomas Stephenson, M.D._, lecturer in chemistry at Guy’s Hospital,\r\nagreed with Dr. Lees and Dr. Bernays, and had no doubt of the\r\ncorrectness of their experiments.\r\n\r\nIt was also proved by the prisoner’s brother-in-law that the prisoner\r\nwas in the habit of taking sarsaparilla, and that whilst the prisoner\r\nlodged with him, the witness had been using _Battle’s Vermin Killer_,\r\nas he was troubled with mice in his room. This he had bought at a shop\r\nin the Vauxhall Road, but he did not recollect having any of it left,\r\nor of the prisoner using it in his room. The prisoner had left Mrs.\r\nWilson a few hours after the woman’s death, saying he was going to\r\ntelegraph down the line and would be absent till the evening. He did\r\nnot return until about nine on the morning of the 11th, when he said\r\nhis cousin would take the child, which Mrs. Wilson dressed and gave to\r\nhim, and never saw it again until the 15th, when it was lying dead in a\r\npublic-house at Battersea, having been found drowned in the river. He\r\nalso promised Mrs. Wilson that he would attend the woman’s funeral, but\r\ndid not, and told her on one occasion that he always had strychnia by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_For the defence_ Mr. Fulton urged that the evidence of the “arching”\r\nof the body was very vague, and rested only on the word of Mrs. Wilson,\r\nwho had not mentioned this important symptom either to the doctor or\r\nthe coroner’s constable, and that without that symptom the death might\r\nbe accounted for by epilepsy, and the first opinion of Dr. Miller\r\njustified. He endeavoured to minimise the evidence of the analysts, and\r\nargued that the conduct of the prisoner in his attendance on his wife\r\nwas a strong proof of his innocence. “Motive,” he said, “there appeared\r\nto be none, as from his wages the prisoner was quite able to bear the\r\nexpense of the mother and child.”\r\n\r\nThe jury, however, returned a verdict of “guilty,” and the prisoner was\r\nexecuted on the 2nd of December, admitting the justice of his sentence,\r\nand that he was a party to the death of the child, but saying others\r\nwere in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSTRYCHNIA AND BRUCIA.\r\n\r\n Contained in St. Ignatius’s bean—False Angostura bark—_Nux\r\n Vomica_, &c.—Properties of strychnia—Facility of detection.\r\n _Tests_: (1) Microscope—(2) Taste—(3) Color test; ditto\r\n in other alkaloids, in bile, and in resinous and saccharine\r\n matters—(4) Physiological test (Marshall Hall)—(5) Bichromate\r\n of potash—(6) Picric acid—(7) Sulphuric acid and sodium\r\n nitrite—(8) Mercuric chloride.

The plants yet proved\r\nto contain these two alkaloids are:—_Strychnos nux-vomica_ (bark and\r\nseeds), _Strychnos Ignatia_ (Faba amara, or St. Ignatius’s bean),\r\n_Strychnos Tieute_ (the Upas tree of Java), _Strychnos toxifera_ (main\r\nsource of woorara or curare, the arrow poison of the South American\r\nIndians), and _Strychnos Ligustrina_ and _Colubrina_ —“snakewood”), a\r\ntree of Asia. _S. potatorum_ —“clearing nut”) and _S. pseudokina_ are\r\nnot poisonous.\r\n\r\nIn commerce, “Nux vomica,” “Faba amara, or St. Ignatius’s bean,” “false\r\nAngostura bark” (the bark of Strychnos nux-vomica), and an extract\r\ncalled “curare,” are met with. The last is made by mixing the juice\r\nof the bark of Strychnos toxifera and another species with pepper\r\nand acrid plants; as its effects depend upon “_curarine_,” another\r\nalkaloid, and not upon strychnia, it will not enter much into our\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“_Faba Amara_,” St. Ignatius’s bean, contains 1·2 per cent. Strychnia\r\nand some Brucia.\r\n\r\n“_False Angostura Bark_” contains Strychnia and Brucia, gives a light\r\nyellow powder, intensely bitter, and turned red by nitric acid.\r\n\r\n_Nux Vomica_, a flattened circular seed, from half to one inch\r\ndiameter, generally concavo-convex, with a slight central prominence.\r\nColour greyish-brown; silky from radiating hairs. Substance tough\r\nand horny; powder light brown, with an odour like liquorice, and an\r\nintense and persistent bitter taste. Nitric acid gives with the powder\r\nand with the extract an orange-red colour, owing to the presence of\r\n_brucia_. The aqueous infusion gives a precipitate with tannin, and an\r\nolive-green tint with neutral ferric chloride.\r\n\r\nSTRYCHNIA, C_{21}H_{22}N_{2}O_{2}, occurs in commerce in opaque\r\nwhite rhombic prisms (the “right square octahedra” of the British\r\nPharmacopœia are not met with), inodorous, having a sp. gr. of 1·36.\r\nOne part of strychnia dissolves in 7000 parts of cold, in 2500 parts of\r\nboiling, water; in 1250 parts of ether; in 1000 of carbon disulphide;\r\nin 200 of _absolute_ alcohol; in 120 parts of cold, and 10 parts of\r\nhot, rectified spirit; in 181 parts of amylic alcohol; in 164 of\r\nbenzene; and 7 of chloroform. Creasote and essential and fixed oils\r\nalso dissolve strychnia (Blyth).\r\n\r\nIt sublimes in needle shaped crystals, or sometimes, if too quickly\r\nheated, in drops, at 169° C.; melts at 221° C., finally darkening and\r\ncarbonizing.\r\n\r\nIts bitter taste is its most prominent physical characteristic. I have\r\nverified the statement that one grain of strychnia in a gallon (70,000\r\ngrains) of water is distinctly perceptible. One grain in 30,000 is\r\nmarkedly bitter.\r\n\r\nIts salts are crystallizable, and also bitter, lævo-rotatory in\r\nsolution, mostly colourless, neutral to test-paper, generally\r\nsoluble with facility in water, hence more rapidly poisonous than\r\nthe free alkaloid. _Strychnia sulphates_ occur in large four-sided\r\nprisms, octahedrons, or needles, according to the amount of water of\r\ncrystallization. _Strychnia nitrate_ crystallizes in silky needles,\r\neasily soluble in water. The _sulphate_ is officinal in the French,\r\nthe _nitrate_ in the German, Austrian, Swiss, Norwegian, and Dutch\r\nPharmacopœias. The acetate and hydrochloride are met with in commerce,\r\nbut are not officinal. _Strychnia_ itself, the free alkaloid, is\r\nprescribed in the British Pharmacopœia. _Liquor strychniæ_ is a\r\nsolution of the hydrochloride.\r\n\r\n_Separation._—Strychnia is probably the easiest of the alkaloids to\r\ndetect, on account of its stability and the delicacy of its reactions.\r\nOne half-millionth of a grain in the pure state is discoverable by the\r\ncolour tests (Pharm. Journ., July, 1856). Putrefaction does not change\r\nit, for Richter detected it in tissues after _eleven years_ (Sammlung\r\nKlin. Vorträge, 69, 562), and other observers in decomposed or buried\r\nbodies after five to eight weeks. And yet there are few analysts who\r\nhave not on some occasion failed to find it (see p. 147.) A very\r\nsmall quantity, about a grain, may destroy life. Even of this, only\r\na portion is absorbed; the rest is eliminated by vomiting (when it\r\noccurs), and by the urine and fæces; the absorbed portion is diffused\r\nwith great rapidity through a large mass of blood and tissue; the\r\nresult is that we are looking for _one part_ of the poison in about a\r\n_million times_ its weight of impurities—almost worse than the needle\r\nin the haystack. Matters are still more difficult if the theory be true\r\nthat an alkaloid, in killing, itself suffers change (see pp. 128 and\r\n133)—an idea that Dr. Letheby and Mr. Nunneley strongly repudiated\r\nin the Palmer defence, though the latter witness had to admit that\r\nhe himself had once failed to detect strychnia in an animal to which\r\nhe had administered it. Dragendorff records several negative results\r\nwithout apparent cause. Taylor (Med. Jur., 1873, Vol. I., 414) mentions\r\ncases of non-discovery by Dr. Reese of Philadelphia, Mr. Horsley of\r\nCheltenham, by himself in the organs of an animal hypodermically\r\npoisoned; and also a case in which _five grains_ had been taken, and\r\nonly a little over a grain was found. Sonnenschein (Casper’s Handbook)\r\nin one case found a quantity in the stomach, but none in the tissues;\r\nyet it had caused death. All these facts greatly support the theory\r\nthat the alkaloid is itself changed in causing death.\r\n\r\nHowever this be, if the stomach has failed to yield strychnia, the\r\nwhole of the rest of the organs, the blood, and the muscles—in fact,\r\nas much of the body as can be managed—should be extracted with hot\r\nredistilled methylated spirit acidified with a little acetic acid. It\r\nis easy to fit up an arrangement with a stoneware pan, a wooden cover,\r\nand a coil of tin pipe, through which steam can be passed, and thus\r\nthe alcohol can be kept warm for two or three hours without much loss.\r\nStrain the whole through a cloth, distil off most of the alcohol,\r\nevaporate on a water bath at about 70° C., and treat the extract as\r\ndescribed in the general process for alkaloids. To facilitate the\r\npurification, the alcoholic solution may be precipitated by acetate\r\nof lead (_avoiding much excess_), filtered, the lead removed from\r\nthe filtrate by adding sufficient sulphate of potash in solution and\r\nallowing it to settle, and the clear liquid evaporated as before. Much\r\nsyrupy matter, which occasions trouble, is thus removed.\r\n\r\nThe ether-chloroform solution (p. 5), by spontaneous evaporation,\r\nleaves the strychnia in “rosettes, veined leaves, stellate dotted\r\nneedles, circles with broken radii, and branched and reticulated forms”\r\n(Guy and Ferrier, Forens. Med., 1881, 568). If not yet pure enough to\r\ncrystallize, advantage may be taken of the fact that while most of the\r\nimpurities are charred by warm concentrated sulphuric acid, strychnia\r\nis very little affected. A few drops of this acid are therefore added\r\nto the residue, then it is warmed for ten or fifteen minutes on the\r\nwater-bath, finally diluted to about ten cubic centimetres, filtered,\r\nthe filter washed with water, and the filtrate treated again with\r\nammonia and ether-chloroform. The residue left by the latter, on\r\nspontaneous evaporation, will now be pure enough for the following\r\n\r\nTESTS.—1. The microscopic appearances are so various as to be\r\nsomewhat indefinite; Guy’s description has been already given. If _no_\r\ncrystals are found, strychnia and most other alkaloids are unlikely to\r\nbe present. But if crystals _are_ obtained, they frequently, on further\r\nexamination, prove to be some inorganic salt or an ammonium compound,\r\nleading to wrong conclusions, if the microscope be trusted too much.\r\n\r\n2. Dissolve in water with a trace of acid, and divide on several\r\nwatch-glasses, as described in the introduction. If one portion be\r\ncautiously _tasted_, and there be no bitterness, strychnia is very\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\n3. Proceed at once to the _colour test_. Transfer a portion of the\r\nresidue, dissolved in a drop of acetic acid, to a white porcelain dish\r\nor plate; dry gently on the water-bath; moisten it with about two drops\r\nof pure concentrated sulphuric acid; _strychnia gives no coloration_;\r\nwith the point of a knife place a minute quantity of finely-powdered\r\nperoxide of manganese (the precipitated hydrate is often recommended,\r\nbut the natural peroxide answers better, being more gradual in its\r\naction) on the side of the dish; slant the dish so as to allow the\r\nliquid to come in contact with the powder. At the moment of contact\r\na _deep rich blue_ colour is produced if 1/20000th of a grain of\r\nstrychnia be present. The blue colour rapidly changes into _purple_,\r\n_crimson_, _rich red-brown_, then fades into _bright orange-red_, which\r\nlast tint remains for some hours. By cautiously stirring with a glass\r\nrod, the succession of colours can be brought out again at another\r\nspot. One or two other qualified observers should always be summoned\r\nto witness the experiment, for two reasons; _first_, that they may\r\ntestify at the trial, if necessary, to the certainty of the conclusion;\r\n_secondly_, because the sense of colour is differently developed in\r\ndifferent people, and, if the hues are faint, one is apt to imagine\r\nwhat one expects to find. But if two or three, without prompting, see\r\nthe same appearances, the chance of error is removed.\r\n\r\nApplied in this way, the succession of colours is _absolutely peculiar\r\nto strychnia_. But, as objections have been made that these can be\r\nproduced from other substances, they may as well be discussed and\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Curarine_ (from Strychnos toxifera) has a bitter taste, is\r\nalmost insoluble in ether and chloroform; hence it is not usually\r\nextracted by the above alkaloidal process, but remains behind in the\r\naqueous liquid. With sulphuric acid and peroxide of manganese it gives\r\nthe same colours as strychnia, but the changes are slower. _With\r\nsulphuric acid alone_, it yields a pale violet colour, changing to\r\ndirty red, and finally to rose. Its physiological effects are opposite\r\nto those of strychnia—so much so that it has been proposed as an\r\nantidote.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Pyroxanthine_ (a rare substance, obtained in very small quantity\r\nfrom wood spirit), _salicine_ (from the willow), and _piperine_ (from\r\npepper), give _with sulphuric acid alone_ a deep-red colour, destroyed\r\nor spoilt by peroxide of manganese. (Nunneley, in Palmer’s trial.)\r\n\r\n(_c_) If sugar and bile should be present together, sulphuric acid will\r\ndevelope a purple colour very like the strychnia test. Bile would also\r\ngive bitterness. But it must be remembered that bile, without sugar,\r\nwill not give the colour, that sugar will not be extracted by the\r\nether-chloroform, and that the colour will appear immediately on the\r\naddition of the acid alone, whereas strychnia remains then uncoloured.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Many resinous and saccharine matters are coloured by sulphuric\r\nacid, but can be got rid of by warming with the acid as described above.\r\n\r\nSo that none of these can be mistaken for strychnia. This important\r\ntest depends upon the action of nascent oxygen; hence any substance\r\nwhich yields oxygen will give the colours more or less satisfactorily.\r\nBichromate of potash, potassium ferricyanide, peroxide of lead,\r\nperoxide of cerium (Sonnenschein), have been employed, but most of\r\nthem give colours of their own, and none are so good as peroxide of\r\nmanganese. It is only necessary that the manganese should be finely\r\npounded and not too much added. The action is slower and more lasting\r\nthan with bichromate.\r\n\r\nLetheby’s galvanic test is interesting, and has the advantage of not\r\nintroducing any extraneous substance into the matter under examination,\r\nso that another alkaloid can be tested for afterwards. I have found\r\nit better to place the drop of supposed strychnia solution, acidified\r\nwith a drop of dilute sulphuric acid (10 per cent. strength) on a\r\nwhite plate, to place on its opposite sides two small pieces of\r\nplatinum foil pressed closely against the plate, touching the drop,\r\nand approaching within a quarter of an inch of one another, and to\r\ntouch them simultaneously with the terminals of a battery of _two_\r\nGrove’s or other cells. In the region of the positive terminal the same\r\ncolours manifest themselves as with peroxide of manganese. If no colour\r\nis shown at once, the battery should be removed, as further galvanic\r\naction may decompose any other alkaloid that may be present. The test\r\nis not so delicate as sulphuric acid and peroxide of manganese.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the presence of much _morphia_ will interfere with the\r\nabove test. But morphia, again, is not extracted completely by the\r\nether-chloroform; and I have not found it to hinder the reaction if\r\nperformed carefully.\r\n\r\nBrucia in ordinary quantities, quinine, cinchonine, veratrine, and\r\nsantonine do not interfere. In strychnia poisoning, morphia should\r\nalways be sought for, as it is used as an antidote. If found, its\r\ninterference may be obviated thus. Dissolve the supposed strychnia\r\nin water with a little acetic acid, add an equal volume of _ether_,\r\nand then ammonia in slight excess, and shake well. The strychnia will\r\ndissolve in the ether, the morphia will remain in the aqueous liquid.\r\nOn evaporating the ether, the strychnia will be isolated.\r\n\r\n4. Dr. Marshall Hall’s _physiological test_ is very delicate. With\r\nsome small animal—preferably a frog—proceed as mentioned in the\r\nintroduction (p. 6). Tetanic spasms are caused. But other poisons,\r\nptomaines, and even the mechanical injury, may produce irritation\r\nand perhaps convulsions, so that the test is dangerous, except as\r\nconfirmatory or negative.\r\n\r\n5. _Bichromate of potash_ solution gives with strychnia, at once or\r\non standing, a yellow precipitate, appearing under the microscope\r\nas rectangular plates and prisms. (See Guy and Ferrier’s Forensic\r\nMedicine, p. 567.)\r\n\r\n6. A sublimate of strychnia touched with a drop of dilute _picric\r\nacid_ solution, strength 1 in 250, gives microscopic arborescent\r\ncrystallizations of peculiar _curved_ forms. (_Ibid._)\r\n\r\n7. Treated with concentrated sulphuric acid and then with a crystal\r\nof sodium nitrite, strychnia gives a dirty yellow colour, changed by\r\nan alcoholic solution of potash to a fine orange-red, by an aqueous\r\nsolution to brownish green, and finally to dirty red-brown. (Arnold,\r\nArch. d. Pharm. 3, 20, 561.)\r\n\r\n8. Mercuric chloride produces a white precipitate, as also does\r\npotassium sulphocyanide. All the general reagents for alkaloids\r\nprecipitate strychnia. If, however, the reaction with sulphuric\r\nacid and manganese have come out properly, all the other tests are\r\nsuperfluous; if it has _not_ been obtained, none of the other tests\r\nwill be of use.\r\n\r\n_Preparations._\r\n\r\n  ┌—─—─—─────—──┬—─—─────—─—─—─┬—─—─—───────—─—─—─┬—─—─—──────—─—─—──┐\r\n  │             │              │    Approximate   │    Approximate   │\r\n  │    Name.    │ Composition. │     Amount of    │     Amount of    │\r\n  │             │              │     Strychnia.   │      Brucia.     │\r\n  ├—─—─—─—──────┼—─—───────—─—─┼—─—─—─—─—───────—─v—─—──────—─—─—─—──┤\r\n  │             │              │                  │                  │\r\n  │            {│ Aqueous     }│                  │                  │\r\n  │  Liquor    {│ solution    }│    4 grs. in     │       None.      │\r\n  │ Strychniæ, {│ of strychnia}│    1 fl. oz.     │                  │\r\n  │    B.P.    {│hydrochloride}│                  │                  │\r\n  │             │              │                  │                  │\r\n  │   Tinct.   {│Nut extracted}│   0·15 per cent. │   0·15 per cent. │\r\n  │ Nucis Vom. {│ with spirit }│                  │                  │\r\n  │             │              │                  │                  │\r\n  │ Extractum  {│ Spirituous  }│                  │                  │\r\n  │ Nuc.

Tardieu found in a packet\r\nof 19 grains, 1½ grain of strychnia, or 7·7 per cent., the rest being\r\n_Potato_ starch and Prussian blue. Woodman and Tidy (For. Med. p. 329)\r\nfound 23 per cent. strychnia, with sugar, flour, and Prussian blue.\r\nBernays found 10·7 per cent. of strychnia, with flour and Prussian\r\nblue. (Barlow’s case.)\r\n\r\n2. _Butler’s_ contains flour, soot, and about 5 per cent. strychnia.\r\nSometimes it contains Prussian blue, and sometimes carbonate of barium\r\nin place of strychnia.\r\n\r\n3. _Gibson’s_ contains half a grain of strychnia in each powder.\r\n\r\n4. _Miller’s Rat Powder_ contains oatmeal, and about 6 per cent. of nux\r\nvomica (equal to 0·023 strychnia and 0·067 brucia). (Blyth, Man. of\r\nPrac. Chem. p. 317.)\r\n\r\n5. _Marsden’s Vermin and Insect Killer_: one packet contains ¾ grain\r\nstrychnia. (Lancet, April 19, 1856.)\r\n\r\n6. _Barber’s_ “_Magic Vermin Killer Powders_” weigh 28 grains and\r\ncontain 10 per cent. of strychnia. “Hunter’s Infallible” also contains\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn _Keating’s Insect Powder_ I have found no strychnia nor arsenic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUCIA.\r\n\r\nC_{23} H_{26} N_{2} O_{4}, 4 H_{2} O, is probably derived from\r\nstrychnia by the substitution of two molecules of methoxyl (CH_{3} O)\r\nfor two atoms of hydrogen (Shenstone, Chem. Soc. Journal, Feb., 1883),\r\nhence might be named _dimethoxystrychnia_. But efforts to change it\r\ninto strychnia have, as yet, been unsuccessful. All plants containing\r\nstrychnia contain also brucia. In _false Angostura bark_ the latter\r\nmuch predominates. It occurs in needles or 4-sided monoclinic prisms\r\n(rarely in tables), colourless, intensely bitter, lævo-rotatory to a\r\nless extent than strychnia, but more soluble in water, alcohol, &c.,\r\nhence remaining in the mother liquors in the preparation of strychnia.\r\nInsoluble in pure ether. It melts at 151° C. (Blyth), and produces a\r\nscanty amorphous sublimate near its temperature of decomposition. The\r\nsalts are neutral, easily soluble in water, and crystallize in needles\r\n(the acetate with difficulty). Its physiological action is the same as\r\nstrychnia, but six or seven times weaker.\r\n\r\nWith the general reagents for alkaloids brucia gives precipitates. With\r\n_concent. nitric acid_ it gives a deep-red colour, changing to orange,\r\nand finally to yellow. A trace of stannous chloride (protochloride of\r\ntin) turns the red solution purple: excess bleaches it.[98] This test\r\nis very delicate. In former times commercial strychnia always contained\r\nbrucia, hence the coloration by nitric acid was even looked upon as\r\na test for strychnia (see p. 125, and p. 156). But, as the strychnia\r\nnow sold is generally pure, it gives no colour with nitric acid in the\r\ncold. Therefore, if both strychnia and brucia are found in a product\r\nextracted from the animal tissues, it follows that _Nux Vomica_, or one\r\nof the plants, or their preparations, has been used, and not the pure\r\nalkaloid. The microscope in this case will generally detect some of the\r\nvegetal tissue or hairs in the stomach.\r\n\r\nConcent. sulphuric acid, followed by bichromate of potash, gives with\r\nbrucia a red-brown colour passing to green and yellow (Guy).\r\n\r\nWhenever strychnia is found, brucia should also be looked for.\r\n\r\nIGASURIA, a supposed third alkaloid of the Strychnos tribe, has been\r\nshown by Shenstone to be a mixture of strychnia and brucia (Chem. Soc.\r\nJournal, Sept. 1881, p. 457).\r\n\r\n_Strychnic or Igasuric Acid_, obtained by Pelletier and Caventun from\r\nNux Vomica and from St. Ignatius’ Bean, is probably identical with\r\nmalic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOSES.\r\n\r\n_Medicinal dose_ of strychnia 1/30 to 1/12 grain. _Fatal dose_:\r\nsmallest recorded ½ grain (Dr. Warner, “Poisoning by Strychnia,” p.\r\n138), ¼ grain (Guy; also case of Agnes Sennett, p. 121, _ante_), but\r\na child of two or three years was killed by 1/16 grain (Christison):\r\naverage for adults, ½ to 2 grains (Taylor).\r\n\r\n_Recovery_ has taken place after 3 grains (Taylor), 4 grains (Lancet,\r\n1863, i. 54), 3 to 7 grains (Husemann), 7 grains (Med. Gaz., xli.,\r\n305), “20 grains or more” (? Guy and Ferrier’s Forens. Med., 1881,\r\np. 574), 40 grains (Med. Times and Gaz., 1865, p. 267). If these\r\nstatements are correct, they must be accounted for either by vomiting,\r\nearly and vigorous treatment, or impurity of the alkaloid.\r\n\r\nPoisonous symptoms have sometimes occurred in adults, and frequently in\r\nchildren, from medicinal doses.\r\n\r\n_Fatal close of nux vomica_: of the powder, 30 grains is the smallest\r\n(= ⅓ grain strychnia), (Hoffmann, Med. Rat. System, 2, 175), of the\r\nalcoholic extract, 3 grains (Christison on Poisons, p. 642).\r\n\r\n_Brucia_ is not used in medicine. _Fatal dose_ rather uncertain,\r\nprobably three to ten grains.\r\n\r\nFATAL PERIOD FOR STRYCHNIA:—Shortest, five minutes (Dr. Gray on\r\nStrychnia, 1872, p. 55); longest, six hours after three grains (Taylor,\r\nGuy’s Hosp. Reports, Oct., 1857, p. 483); average, two hours. _For\r\nnux vomica_:—Shortest, fifteen minutes; longest, three hours or more\r\n(Guy); average, two hours (Taylor), one hour (Guy).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms commence_ at various intervals after taking, according to\r\ndose, form, and constitution. The beginning may be (1) almost immediate\r\n(Mad. Merghelynk, 1870, Taylor’s Med. Juris., p. 408), (2) in five\r\nminutes (case of Dr. Warner, also Dr. Gray on Strychnia, 1872, p. 55),\r\n(3) in fifteen minutes (trial of Dove, p. 242), (4) about an hour\r\n(Palmer’s trial, p. 102), (5) forty minutes (Lond. Med. Repository,\r\nxix., 448), up to two and a half hours (Wormley, Microchemistry of\r\nPoisons, p. 538). Hence no conclusion can safely be drawn from this\r\nfeature (see Dr. Letheby’s evidence in the Palmer trial, p. 166).\r\nProbably Dr. Todd’s statement in the same trial is the most correct\r\naverage:—“Symptoms in ten minutes, if in solution and a large dose;\r\notherwise in a half to one hour.”\r\n\r\nThe different action of powder and solution is shown in the following\r\nexperiments on two full-grown rats:—\r\n\r\n1. Half a grain of _powdered_ strychnia—First convulsion in twenty\r\nminutes, death in two and a half hours.\r\n\r\n2. Same quantity _dissolved_ in sufficient acid—Effect almost\r\nimmediate; death in half an hour. In the stomach, liver, and brain,\r\nstrychnia was separately detected.\r\n\r\nPills, especially if hard, would be very slow in action. The most\r\nintense effect is produced by hypodermic injection.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS IN MAN:—Bitter taste in the mouth, feeling of suffocation,\r\njerkings and twitchings of head and limbs, then tetanic convulsions\r\nof nearly all the muscles. Body stretched out stiff, finally arched\r\nback so as to rest on the head and the heels (opisthotonos), spasmodic\r\nand difficult breathing, usually a peculiar grin (risus sardonicus).\r\n_After a time the jaw becomes tightly fixed_ (trismus or lockjaw), the\r\nfingers are clenched, the feet arched inwards (incurvated), the eyes\r\nprominent and staring. The spasm lasts from a half to two minutes, then\r\nthere is an interval of comparative rest. The pupils are generally\r\n_dilated_ during the fit, _contracted_ in the interval. A touch, a\r\nchange of position, or a sudden noise, will usually cause a renewal\r\nof the spasm. In severe cases the convulsions recur at diminishing\r\nintervals, increasing in violence till death occurs from exhaustion or\r\nsuffocation. Vomiting is very rare. Taylor says “the jaw is not always\r\nfixed during a paroxysm: the patient can frequently speak and swallow”\r\n(Med. Juris., 1873, p. 404). Woodman and Tidy (Forens. Med., 1877, p.\r\n330) say that this symptom is invariably present. Guy and Ferrier are\r\ncautious, and state that the effort to drink often causes rigid spasms\r\nof the jaw, but that the “jaw is not always fixed, even in the fit”\r\n(Guy and Ferrier’s Forens. Med., 1881, p. 573). On the whole, fixing of\r\nthe jaw is usual but not invariable. In the Palmer and Dove trials the\r\npatients spoke or shrieked during the paroxysms.\r\n\r\nAs to impatience of touch, Mr. Morley’s dictum in the Dove trial\r\nexpresses the truth: “_Not_ shrinking from touch is _consistent_ with\r\nstrychnia, but a desire not to be touched is an _indication_ of it.\r\nSeveral cases of strychnia had desired to be rubbed.” See also the\r\ncases of Mrs. Smyth and Mr. Clutterbuck, pp. 122 and 123.\r\n\r\nConsciousness, in the immense majority of cases, is preserved to the\r\nlast. If, as in Mrs. Dove, insensibility occurs, it is due to the\r\nexhaustion. In this trial Dr. Christison said “it is unusual to be\r\ninsensible before death from strychnia.” Farquharson (Therapeutics, p.\r\n264) states that “the cerebral functions remain unimpaired almost up to\r\nthe close.” This is agreed to by all authorities.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of strychnia poisoning have been explained away by the\r\ndefence as “hysteria,” “idiopathic tetanus,” “epileptic convulsions\r\nwith tetanic complications” (Dr. Macdonald in Palmer’s trial), “angina\r\npectoris” (Dr. Richardson), “apoplexy” (Dr. Bamford’s certificate).\r\nGritty granules on the spinal cord, sexual or other excitement, cold\r\nand damp, drink, &c., were in that trial assigned as causes. As to\r\n“gritty granules,” the expression is not clear; such granules as\r\noccurred in Cook have been found in many _post-mortems_, where they\r\ncertainly did not cause the death. Sexual excitement was out of the\r\nquestion in this case. Drink does not cause tetanus. The cold and damp\r\nwere hardly sufficient reasons, as no symptoms of chill were noticed.\r\nApoplexy is distinct, as in this the _brain_ would show the disease.\r\n\r\n_Hysteria_, _epilepsy_, and _idiopathic tetanus_ (tetanus which is\r\n“constitutional,” or not occasioned by external injury) produce\r\nin some cases insensibility; strychnia, as a rule, does not. They\r\nare also _continuous_ in symptoms. _Traumatic tetanus_ is caused\r\nby a wound or injury, rarely by ulcers or syphilitic sores (see p.\r\n113). If there be none of these it cannot, of course, be traumatic\r\ntetanus. _Hysteria_ is exceedingly variable, and simulates many other\r\ndiseases: it is generally the result of excitement. But it does not\r\nproduce opisthotonos. _Epilepsy_ has never such symptoms as strychnia\r\noccasions: it rarely supervenes without some history of hereditary\r\ntendency, and it is always attended by unconsciousness (p. 151).\r\n_Idiopathic tetanus_ may occur from a cold (see a case of Dr. Todd’s,\r\nLond. Med. Gaz., Nov., 1850), or from no assignable cause. It is very\r\nclose to strychnia in symptoms, but the latter is much more rapid: the\r\nshortest recorded fatal period for natural tetanus being twelve hours\r\n—“even here the early symptoms had been probably overlooked”—Sir B.\r\nBrodie), the usual about eight days. In both kinds of tetanus the jaw\r\nis usually the _first_, in strychnia the _last_ part to be affected.\r\n_Angina pectoris_ Dr. Richardson himself disposed of, as in the case\r\nhe mentions he says that had he known more at the time he would have\r\nsuspected strychnia (see Palmer’s trial, p. 176). The symptoms of this\r\ndisease, as given in the leading works, differ much from strychnia\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.—Neither characteristic nor uniform (Guy\r\nand Ferrier). As a rule, the body is relaxed at death, and stiffens\r\nafterwards (Taylor), but occasionally the reverse is the case (_Reg._\r\nv. _Vyse_, Central Criminal Court, 1862).[99] Sometimes the rigidity,\r\nas in Cook’s case, remains for months. Clinching of the hands, arching\r\nof the feet, are nearly always present, but they may likewise be\r\nnoticed in cases of natural death (Casper, quoted by Taylor, Med.\r\nJur., p. 406; also Prof. Partridge’s evidence in the Palmer trial, p.\r\n172—“half-bent hands and fingers, not uncommon after natural death”).\r\n_Brain, spinal cord, and lungs almost invariably congested._ Blood dark\r\nand fluid. In some cases the heart is full of blood, especially on\r\nthe right side, but occasionally it is empty and contracted. Stomach\r\ngenerally healthy, rarely congested. Casper found a dark violet colour\r\nof the muscles of the throat and gullet; this was the only peculiarity\r\nhe noticed, and even this has not occurred in other cases. On the\r\nwhole, the diagnosis must depend mainly on the symptoms during life,\r\nthough the congestion mentioned above is a valuable corroborative from\r\nthe post-mortem. Involuntary evacuation of urine and fæces generally\r\noccurs, but is usual in all painful deaths.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT AND ANTIDOTES.—The question will often arise in a trial\r\nwhether the best means were taken of saving the patient. In Tawell’s\r\ntrial it was actually suggested that the water poured down the throat\r\nmay have caused the death by choking! If emetics are used, they are\r\nall more or less poisons. If the stomach-pump be employed, it will\r\ncause irritation and exhaustion. Nevertheless, where a violent poison\r\nhas been given, the only hope is in strong remedies—to empty the\r\nstomach by emetics or the pump, to give tannin or animal charcoal, and\r\nto generally sustain nature during the operations. As the inquiry is,\r\n“What caused death?” the defence will frequently endeavour to fasten\r\nthe responsibility on the remedial measures. _These would not of\r\nthemselves be fatal_, unless disease or poison had previously brought\r\nthe patient to a nearly dying state; whether it be disease or poison\r\nwill be otherwise determined.\r\n\r\nThe direct antidote to strychnia is _chloroform_. In animals I have\r\nnoticed a large percentage of recoveries. Woodman and Tidy (Forens.\r\nMed., p. 332) give the majority of recoveries to this agent.[100]\r\nI believe that most cases could be saved if, on the approach of\r\nthe convulsions, they could be put _vigorously under the action of\r\nchloroform_. Chloral hydrate, nicotine, opium, &c., have been also\r\ntried with scanty success. Tannin precipitates strychnia, as well as\r\nmost other alkaloids; hence may be useful as an adjunct. When the jaw\r\nis fixed, liquids can only be given through a tube; even teeth have\r\nbeen taken out to effect this. Enemata may also be used. Artificial\r\nrespiration should be cautiously tried. Curara and Calabar Bean are\r\ndangerous and not effective.\r\n\r\nDeath or recovery is always rapid; if a person lives over five or six\r\nhours, the case is hopeful (Woodman and Tidy).\r\n\r\nOne or two considerations remain. Dr. Taylor’s evidence in the\r\nPalmer trial, though in most points it has been corroborated by\r\nsubsequent authorities, contained the following statements that require\r\nrectifying:—\r\n\r\n(1.) “_The colour tests are fallacious_” (pp. 144 and 147). They are\r\nquite decisive if properly performed, and the precautions remembered.\r\n\r\n(2.) “_I know of no process which can detect strychnia in the tissues_”\r\n(p. 133). This has been repeatedly done by the same method as is used\r\nfor the stomach. Dr. Taylor himself admits it in his later works (see\r\nMed. Juris., 1873, p. 415). No operator now neglects the tissues.\r\nThey should always be forwarded for analysis at the same time as the\r\nstomach, but in separate jars.\r\n\r\nIf indications be obtained, the question will occur—“Could they be\r\ndue to Selmi’s ptomaine, resembling strychnia?” If we consider that in\r\nan immense multitude of cases of suspicion, where there is no clue,\r\nstrychnia is tested for but _not found_, it is evident that this\r\nnatural imitation of the alkaloid must be decidedly rare. So that the\r\noverwhelming probability, if the colour test has been obtained, is that\r\nstrychnia itself is present.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Palmer afterwards is said to have more or less admitted\r\nthat he poisoned Cook, “_but not with strychnia_.” Though the word\r\nof such a man is of little value, there are others who have been of\r\nthis opinion. Mr. Justice Grove is reported to have expressed some\r\nhesitation afterwards on this point. Mr. Nunneley, who, although he\r\nshowed too much partizanship in the trial, yet may be said to have\r\ncertainly had great experience with animals, asserted that the symptoms\r\ndid not quite coincide with strychnia. Others followed in this train.\r\nThe assertion is certainly wrong, but Dr. Guy (Forens. Med. 1881, p.\r\n525) has made a suggestion that may be noticed. After quoting Dr.\r\nShearman’s case of a patient who had taken one and a-half grain of\r\n_morphia_ acetate, and who was seized with “twitching of the limbs and\r\nface, difficulty in swallowing, spasms of the arms, legs, and abdomen,\r\npartial opisthotonos, and great activity of the reflex function”\r\n(Med. Times and Gazette, March 7, 1857); another case from orfila,\r\nwhen _twenty-two_ grains of morphia hydrochloride had caused lockjaw,\r\ntension of the abdomen, and occasional convulsions; and Castaing’s\r\ncase, when twenty-six grains of morphia acetate, and twelve grains\r\nof tartar emetic, had been purchased, and the victim had “vomiting,\r\npurging, convulsions, lockjaw, rigid spasms of the neck and abdomen,\r\ninability to swallow, loss of sensibility in the legs, contracted\r\npupils, and stertorous breathing,” Dr. Guy goes on to say that as Cook\r\nhad probably three grains of morphia acetate within seventy-two hours,\r\nand had previously been reduced by tartar emetic, his death may have\r\nbeen due to _morphia_ and not to strychnia. But setting aside the\r\nsecond and third cases where the dose was so large, Cook’s symptoms\r\ndid not on the whole agree with those of Dr. Shearman’s patient. The\r\ndose in the time was not larger, but the effects on Cook were immensely\r\nmore severe. If these be examples of morphia in its worst and most\r\nanomalous aspect, it certainly cannot dispute with strychnia for the\r\nresponsibility of Cook’s death.[101] See also Dr. Todd’s remark, p. 117.\r\n\r\nThe three preparations of “gritty granules” on the spinal cord in the\r\nmuseum of St. Thomas’s Hospital, “in which the patients are said to\r\nhave died from tetanus” (Mr. Nunneley’s evidence, p. 152, also Dr.\r\nMacdonald’s evidence, p. 180), are in section N, numbers 113, 114, and\r\n115. They are described in the catalogue as—\r\n\r\n “113. Several small patches of earthy matter on the arachnoid of the\r\n medulla spinalis.”\r\n\r\n “114. A spinal cord. There are numerous large plates of bone on the\r\n arachnoid of the lumbar portion, and of the cauda equina.”\r\n\r\n “115. A similar preparation. The plates of bone extend as high as the\r\n upper dorsal vertebræ.”\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Stewart, professor of comparative anatomy and curator of\r\nthe museum at St. Thomas’s, tells me that these are calcareous, but\r\nnot true bone, that they are not uncommon in post-mortems where they\r\nhave had nothing to do with death, and that if the above had died from\r\ntetanus it would probably have been recorded in the catalogue. As there\r\nis no mention of the cause of death, it is certain that it had no\r\nreference to the so-called “granules.”\r\n\r\nThe assertion of Mr. Morley (Dove’s Case, p. 245), that strychnia is\r\ndecomposed into its elements, is obviously incorrect, probably an error\r\nof the reporter.\r\n\r\nSee also an interesting case lately reported (J. de Pharm. et de\r\nChimie, November 1882), where strychnia was found, and also arsenic, in\r\nthe stomach, liver, and brain.\r\n\r\nDr. John Harley tells me that he finds _hemlock juice_ the best\r\nantidote to the convulsions of all kinds of _tetanus_. He has had many\r\nsuccessful cases. Messrs. Mavor, veterinary surgeons, find this remedy\r\nmost efficacious with horses, in which animal _tetanus_ is very common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTRIALS FOR POISONING BY ARSENIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTWITHSTANDING the difficulties thrown in the way of the purchase of\r\narsenic by the “Sale of Arsenic Regulation Act” of 1852, the cases of\r\npoisoning by the use of this drug have been so numerous, that it has\r\nbeen difficult to select examples without greatly extending the bulk\r\nof this volume. I have, therefore, limited the full reports in this\r\nchapter to two, namely:—(1). The case of Miss Madeline Smith for\r\nthe imputed murder of her lover, Pierre Emile L’Angelier in Glasgow,\r\ntried before the “Lords of the Justiciary,” the chief criminal court\r\nof Scotland, in Edinburgh, on the 30th of June, 1857, a case full\r\nof interest and doubt, the mystery of which will probably never be\r\ndisclosed; and (2) that of Ann Merritt for the murder of her husband,\r\ntried at the Old Bailey, March 8th, 1850, on the verdict in which\r\narose a notable difference of opinion between leading medical and\r\nother experts, and the chief medical witness, as to the possibility\r\nof fixing, with any definiteness, the time at which the arsenic\r\nfound in the body had been administered; resulting in the eventual\r\ncommutation of the capital sentence by Sir George Grey, the Home\r\nSecretary. This was the case referred to by the Attorney-General in\r\nhis cross-examination of Dr. Letheby in Palmer’s trial. For the trial\r\nof Madeline Smith I have relied on the Report reprinted with additions\r\nand corrections from “The Scotsman,” by far the most accurate that I\r\nhave read. To my copy is an Appendix of the _whole_ of the letters,\r\nincluding those suppressed in Court, published in New York at the\r\nAstor Press. Happily it is not necessary to dwell on their disgusting\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF MADELINE SMITH.\r\n\r\n _Before the_ LORD JUSTICE CLERK (_the_ HON. JOHN HOPE), LORD IVORY,\r\n _and_ LORD HANDYSIDE, _at_ EDINBURGH, _30th June and following days,\r\n 1857_.\r\n\r\n _For the Prosecution_: The Lord Advocate (Jas. Moncrieffe), The\r\n Solicitor-General (E. F. Maitland), and Mr. Donald Mackenzie.\r\n\r\n _For the Defence_: The Dean of Faculty, Mr. John Inglis (now Lord\r\n Justice General), Mr. G. Young (now Lord Young), and Mr. H. Moncrieff.\r\n\r\nBy the indictment the Prisoner was charged with administering or\r\ncausing to be administered to Emile L’Angelier,[102] arsenic or some\r\nother poison, in coffee, cocoa, or some other food or drink, on the\r\n19th or 20th of February, and on the 22nd or 23rd of February last,\r\nwith intent to murder, and on the 22nd or 23rd of March, whereby he\r\ndied on the day last named, and was thus murdered by the Prisoner. To\r\nwhich the Prisoner pleaded “Not Guilty.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\n_Pierre Emile L’Angelier_, a Frenchman by birth, had been employed in\r\nScotland since the year 1843, when he was with a firm of nurserymen at\r\nDundee. How long he stayed with them was not proved, but according to\r\nhis own statement he was one of the National Guard in the Revolution\r\nin Paris in 1848. He was always a poor man, and in 1851, when again\r\nin Scotland, was in such straits that he was living at a tavern in\r\nEdinburgh on the charity of its proprietor. When there he was at times\r\nin very low spirits, crying at night, and speaking of committing\r\nsuicide, getting out of bed and walking about the room weeping, and\r\non one occasion on the point apparently of throwing himself out of\r\nthe window of his room had he not been prevented by his companion.\r\nSome love affairs—one with an English lady, another with a lady in\r\nFife—were the causes he assigned for his melancholy and depression.\r\nIn a letter, probably of this date, he wrote, “I never was so unhappy\r\nin my life. I wish I had the courage to blow my brains out.” In 1852\r\nhe was in the employ of another nurseryman at Dundee, still harping on\r\nhis disappointment in love, complaining bitterly of the last lady’s\r\nintended marriage with another—gloomy, moody, dull, and threatening to\r\nstab himself. Vain of his person, he was always talking of his success\r\nwith ladies, and of what he should do if he was again jilted. On one\r\noccasion, when speaking of the use of arsenic for improving the coats\r\nof horses, and asked if he was not afraid of poisoning them, he said,\r\n“Oh, no: so far from doing that, he had taken it himself, without any\r\nbad effects.” From this employment he went to that of Messrs. Huggins\r\nand Co., of Glasgow, where he was looked upon as a steady, industrious\r\nclerk, “a well-behaved, well-principled, religious man.” Whilst with\r\nthis firm he pressed a young friend to introduce him to Miss Smith; and\r\nthus sprang up the attachment which led to the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n_Miss Madeline Smith_, to whom L’Angelier was introduced towards the\r\nend of 1854, was the daughter of an architect of position in Glasgow,\r\nand had lately returned from an English boarding-school. She was\r\nattractive in person, and just of the age to fall violently in love\r\nwith such a plausible, goodlooking man as L’Angelier. As her parents\r\nnaturally had little liking for a merchant’s clerk as their daughter’s\r\nhusband, the love affair that arose at once after the introduction\r\nwas carried on clandestinely by a voluminous correspondence, in which\r\nmore than 200 letters passed from her to the deceased in the brief\r\nperiod of their attachment, and such stolen interviews in or out of her\r\nfather’s house as could be arranged with the connivance of one of his\r\nservants. According to the theory of the prosecution, L’Angelier was an\r\naccomplished and deliberate seducer, who at last gained his purpose on\r\nthe 6th of May, from which date Miss Smith’s letters to her lover speak\r\nplainly of matters of which even married persons would be reticent,\r\nand are couched in language suitable only to married persons. She was\r\nclearly in L’Angelier’s power, who wished to marry her, and made\r\nmore than one arrangement for an elopement. Towards the end of 1856,\r\nhowever, her affection for him began to cool, and with reason. She had\r\naccepted the attentions of a Mr. Minnoch, with the full consent of her\r\nparents, and shortly after actually fixed the day for her marriage with\r\nhim. The danger of her situation pressed upon her. L’Angelier, when he\r\nknew of this, was not the man to sit tamely under such a slight, or to\r\nlet another person marry one of whom he knew so much to her discredit.\r\nShe wrote him to return her letters, begged and prayed him to do so,\r\nand let the engagement drop, to which she never could get the sanction\r\nof her parents. He refused. He had heard a rumour of the Minnoch\r\nengagement, and he threatened to send the letters to her father. Still\r\nit was not revenge that he wanted; he wanted his wife. Her letters at\r\nthis time give the most painful proofs of the state of mind into which\r\nshe had fallen. “On her bended knees,” she wrote, begging “him not to\r\nexpose her, for her mother’s sake,” and “the dread of her father’s\r\nanger.” “As you hope for mercy at the judgment day, do not inform on\r\nme; do not make me a public shame. There is no one I love. My love was\r\nall given to you. My heart is empty, cold. I am unloved. I am despised.\r\nI told you I had ceased to love. It is true.” Such was her letter,\r\npresumably of the 11th of February, 1857. At this time she was engaged\r\nto Minnoch, and the day of the marriage, if not actually fixed, had\r\nbeen talked about. She begged for an interview. In the postscript to\r\nthis sad letter, she added: “I will take you within the door; the area\r\ngate will be open. I shall see you from my window, twelve o’clock. I\r\nwill wait till one o’clock.” The exact date of this letter could not\r\nbe proved, as it had been delivered and not posted. It was dated only\r\nTuesday evening, twelve o’clock; and however ingenious was the argument\r\nof the Lord Advocate, it failed to satisfy the court that it produced\r\nan interview on the 11th which led to another on the 19th—the day on\r\nwhich, according to the Crown, she first administered the poison to her\r\nlover, from which arose the first of his illnesses, as described by\r\nMrs. Jenkins, his landlady.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the trial, the following explanation of the connection\r\nwith L’Angelier had been given by the prisoner, in her examination\r\nbefore the Sheriff Substitute of Lanarkshire on the 31st of March,\r\n“when,” he said, “she answered his questions without hesitation, and\r\nwith great appearance of frankness and candour.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\n “I am a native of Glasgow, 21 years of age, and reside with my father\r\n at No. 7, Blythswood Square, Glasgow. For about two years I have been\r\n acquainted with P. Emile L’Angelier, who was in the employment of\r\n Huggins & Co., in Bothwell Street, and resided at 10, Franklin Place.\r\n He recently paid his addresses to me, and I have met him on a variety\r\n of occasions. I heard of his death on the afternoon of the 23rd of\r\n March from my mother. _I had not seen him for about three weeks before\r\n his death_, and the last time I saw him was on a night about half-past\r\n ten o’clock. On that occasion he tapped at my window, which is on the\r\n ground floor and fronts Main Street. I talked to him from the window,\r\n which is stanchioned outside, and I did not go out to him, nor did he\r\n come into me. This occasion, which, as already said, was the last,\r\n _was about three weeks before his death, and was the last time I saw\r\n him_. He was in the habit of writing notes to me, and I was in the\r\n habit of replying to them. The last note I wrote _was on the Friday\r\n before his death, the 20th of March_. (Identifies note and envelope.)\r\n _In consequence of that note I expected him to visit me on Saturday\r\n the 21st, at my bedroom window, in the same way as before, but he did\r\n not come and sent no notice. There was no tapping at my window on the\r\n Saturday night, nor on the Sunday following._ I went to bed on the\r\n Saturday night about eleven, and remained in bed until the usual time\r\n of getting up next morning, being eight or nine o’clock. In the course\r\n of my meetings with him, he and I had arranged to get married, and at\r\n one time we had proposed September last as the time and subsequently\r\n the present month of March. It was proposed we should reside in\r\n furnished lodgings, but we had not made any definite arrangement as\r\n to time or otherwise. He was very unwell, and had gone to the Bridge\r\n of Allan for his health, and he complained of sickness; but I have\r\n no idea what was the cause of it. _I remember giving him some cocoa\r\n from my window one night, some time ago, but I cannot specify the time\r\n particularly. He took the cup in his hand and barely tasted it, and\r\n I gave him no bread with it._ I was taking some cocoa myself at the\r\n time, and had prepared it myself. (Identifies note No. 2, which she\r\n wrote and sent to post.) _As I had attributed his illness to want of\r\n food, I proposed, as stated in the note, to give him a loaf of bread,\r\n but I said that merely in a joke, and in point of fact I never gave\r\n him any bread._\r\n\r\n I have bought arsenic on various occasions. The last I bought was a\r\n sixpenny-worth, in Currie’s, the apothecary’s shop in Sauchiehall\r\n Street. Prior to that I had bought other two quantities of arsenic for\r\n which I paid sixpence each—one of these in Currie’s, and the other\r\n in Murdoch’s, the apothecary’s shop in Sauchiehall Street. I used it\r\n all as a cosmetic, and applied it to my face, neck, and arms, diluted\r\n with water. The arsenic I got at Currie’s on Wednesday, 18th March,\r\n and used it all on one occasion, having put it all in the basin where\r\n I was to wash myself. I had been advised to this use of arsenic by\r\n a young lady of the name of Giubilei, the daughter of an actress,\r\n whom I had met at school at Clapton near London.[103] I had also seen\r\n it recommended in the newspapers. I did not wish any of my father’s\r\n family to know that I was using arsenic, and therefore never mentioned\r\n it to anyone, and I do not suppose that they or any of the servants\r\n noticed it in the basin. When I bought the arsenic at Murdoch’s, I\r\n am not sure whether I was asked or not what it was for; but I think\r\n I said for a gardener, to kill rats or destroy vermin about flowers,\r\n and I only said this because I did not wish them to know that I was\r\n going to use it as a cosmetic. I do not remember whether I was asked\r\n as to the use I was going to make of the arsenic on the other two\r\n occasions. I likely made the same statement about it as I had done\r\n at Murdoch’s; and on all three occasions, as required in the shops,\r\n I signed my name to a book in which the sales are entered. On the\r\n first occasion I was accompanied by Mary, a daughter of Dr. Buchanan,\r\n of Dumbarton. For several years past Mr. Minnoch, of the firm of W.\r\n Houldsworth & Co., has been coming a good deal about my father’s\r\n house; and about a month ago he made a proposal of marriage to me,\r\n and I gave him my hand in token of acceptance, but no time for the\r\n marriage has been fixed;[104] and my object in writing the note, No.\r\n 1, before mentioned, was to have a meeting with Mr. L’Angelier to tell\r\n him I was engaged to Mr. Minnoch.[105] (Identifies two notes and an\r\n envelope bearing the Glasgow post-mark of 23rd January, as written and\r\n sent by her to L’Angelier.) On the occasion that I gave L’Angelier the\r\n cocoa, I think that I used it must have been known to the servants and\r\n members of my father’s family, as the package containing the cocoa\r\n was lying on the mantelpiece in my room, but no one of the family\r\n used it, as they did not like it. The water that I used I got hot\r\n from the servants. On the night of the 18th, when I used the arsenic\r\n last, I was going to a dinner party at Mr. Minnoch’s house. I never\r\n administered, or caused to be administered, to Mr. L’Angelier arsenic\r\n or anything injurious. And this I declare to be truth.”\r\n\r\nWith this brief introduction, let us proceed to the details of his\r\nvarious illnesses, due, as the prosecution inferred, to arsenical\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jenkins, at whose house L’Angelier came to lodge in the July of\r\n1856, and continued there till his death, spoke of her lodger as of\r\ncivil habits, but wont to stay out at night, for which purpose he\r\nhad the use of a latch-key. His health was usually good; but about\r\nthe middle of February, 1857, he had a severe attack of illness, and\r\nanother on the 23rd, of which she gave the following account:—\r\n\r\n “One night he wished a pass key, as he thought he would be late out.\r\n I went to bed and did not hear him come in. I knocked at his door\r\n about eight the next morning and got no answer. I knocked again, and\r\n he said, ‘Come in, if you please.’ I went in. He said, ‘I have been\r\n very unwell; look what I have vomited.’ I said I thought it was bile.\r\n It was a greenish substance. There was a great deal of it. It was\r\n thick stuff, like gruel. I said, ‘Why did you not call me?’ He said\r\n that while on the road coming home, he was seized with a violent pain\r\n in his bowels and stomach, and when he was taking off his clothes,\r\n thought he should have died on the carpet, and no human eye would have\r\n seen him. ‘I was not able,’ he said, ‘to ring the bell.’ He asked me\r\n to make a little tea, and said he would not go out. I emptied what he\r\n had vomited, and advised him to go to a doctor, and he said he would.\r\n He took a little breakfast and then went to sleep for an hour, when\r\n I went back to him, and he said he was better, and would go out. Mr.\r\n Thuau, who lodges in my house, saw him. He went out between ten and\r\n eleven—his place of business is two streets off. He returned about\r\n three in the afternoon, said he had been to a doctor and brought a\r\n bottle of medicine with him. He took the medicine and complained about\r\n feeling very thirsty.\r\n\r\n “His illness made a great change in his appearance. He looked yellow\r\n and dull, and before that his complexion was fresh. He became dark\r\n under the eyes, and the red of his cheeks seemed to be more broken.\r\n He complained of being very cold after he came in. He lay down on the\r\n sofa, and I laid a railway-rug over him. I did nothing for his feet.\r\n He never was the same after his illness. When asked how he felt, he\r\n was accustomed to say, ‘I never feel well.’ On a Monday morning, about\r\n four o’clock, he called me. He was vomiting. It was the same kind of\r\n stuff as before in colour and otherwise. There was not quite so much\r\n of it. He complained on this occasion likewise of pain in the bowels\r\n and stomach, and of thirst and cold. I did not know he was out the\r\n night before. He did not say anything about it. I put more blankets on\r\n him, jars of hot water to his feet, and made him some tea. I gave him\r\n also a great many drinks—toast and water, lemon and water, and such\r\n like—because he was thirsty. I called again about six in the morning.\r\n He did not rise until the forenoon. Dr. Thomson came to attend,\r\n fetched by Thuau, and left a prescription for powders, of which he\r\n took one or two. He said they were not doing him the good he expected;\r\n ‘the doctor always said he was getting better, but he did not feel\r\n well;’ ‘he did not feel getting better.’ He was eight days away from\r\n business at that time. Some time after he went to Edinburgh, and\r\n returned to Glasgow on the 17th of March, and stayed till the 19th,\r\n when he went away, as he said, to the Bridge of Allan.\r\n\r\n “He went away about 10 A.M., and said he would not be home before\r\n Wednesday night or Thursday morning next week. A letter came for him\r\n on the 19th like those that used to come, and I gave it to Thuau.\r\n I don’t remember any coming on Friday, but one more, like a lady’s\r\n writing, on Saturday, which I also gave to Thuau. (Identifies envelope\r\n as like that of letter received on Saturday, but not another which was\r\n shown her.) L’Angelier was much disappointed at not getting a letter\r\n before he left, and said, ‘If I get a letter, perhaps I shall be home\r\n to-night.’\r\n\r\n “I next saw L’Angelier on Sunday night, about eight. He said the\r\n letter sent had brought him home. I told him it had come on Saturday\r\n afternoon. He did not say where he had come from. I understood he\r\n had been at the Bridge of Allan. He looked much better, and said he\r\n was so. He went out about 9 P.M., and asked for a latch-key, as he\r\n might be late. I was to call him early. It was about half-past two\r\n next morning when I next saw him; he did not use the latch-key, but\r\n rang the bell violently. When I opened the door, he was standing with\r\n his arms on his stomach. He said, ‘I am very bad. I am going to have\r\n another vomiting of that bile.’ The first time I saw the vomitings, I\r\n said it was bile. He said he was never troubled with bile. He said he\r\n never thought he should have got home, he was so bad on the road. He\r\n did not say how he had been bad. The first thing he took was a little\r\n water. I filled up the tumbler, and he tried to vomit. He wished a\r\n little tea. I went into the room (with it?), and before he was half\r\n undressed he was vomiting severely. It was the same kind of matter as\r\n I had seen before. There was a light. The vomiting was attended with\r\n great pain. I asked him whether he had taken anything to disagree\r\n with his stomach. He said he had taken nothing since he was at the\r\n Bridge of Allan. He was chill and cold, and wished a jar of hot water\r\n to his feet, and another to his stomach. I got these for him, and\r\n two blankets and mats. He got a little easier. About four o’clock\r\n he was worse, and on my proposing to go for a doctor said he was a\r\n little better, and I need not. About five he was worse again, and\r\n his bowels became bad. He had been vomiting only up to this time. I\r\n went for Dr. Steven, who could not come so early, but told me to give\r\n him twenty-five drops of laudanum, and put a mustard blister on his\r\n stomach, and if he did not get better he would come. At L’Angelier’s\r\n request, I went again, and the doctor came, who immediately ordered\r\n him mustard. I said to him, ‘Look at what he has vomited.’ He said,\r\n ‘Take it away, it is making him faint.’ I got the mustard, and the\r\n doctor put it on, and I think gave him a little morphia. I said to\r\n L’Angelier, ‘This is the worst attack you have had.’ The doctor stayed\r\n about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. I took him into the\r\n dining-room, and asked him what was wrong; he asked me if he was a\r\n person that tippled. I said, ‘No,’ and that this was the second time\r\n this had occurred, and asked what was the reason. The doctor said this\r\n was matter for explanation. The first time I went back, L’Angelier\r\n asked what the doctor had said. I said he thought he would get over\r\n it, and L’Angelier replied, ‘I am far worse than he thinks.’ About\r\n nine, when I drew the curtains, he looked very ill, and I asked if\r\n there was no one he wished sent for. He asked to see Miss Perry, of\r\n Bamfield Street. I sent for her. He said he thought that if he could\r\n get five minutes’ sleep he should be better. These were the last words\r\n I heard him use. I went back into the room in about five minutes; he\r\n was then quite quiet, and I thought he was asleep. The doctor then\r\n returned, and I told him so. He went into the room, felt his pulse,\r\n lifted his head, and said he was dead.”\r\n\r\nNothing of importance with reference to the symptoms of his attacks\r\nwas elicited in cross-examination. His first illness, according to the\r\nwitness, was a great deal worse than the second. It was in January that\r\nhe first complained of ill health. He then first complained of his\r\ntongue; then a boil came out on his neck, and shortly after another.\r\nShe did not think that he ate what suited him, and especially too\r\nmany vegetables, to which he said he was accustomed in France. On the\r\nmorning of his death he complained about his mouth being sore. The\r\ndoctor gave him some water, and he said it was choking him, or that\r\nit was going into his chest. When in bed that morning he always had\r\nhis arms out on the bed clothes. She did not remember his hands being\r\nclenched. His right hand was clenched when he died. The remainder of\r\nthe cross-examination related to the dress he usually wore, and the\r\nsearch by the officers for his papers.[106]\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Thomson_, a physician in Glasgow, who had known L’Angelier for two\r\nyears, gave the following evidence as to his health up to about the\r\n10th of March:—\r\n\r\n “He consulted me professionally, the first time, fully a year ago,\r\n when he had a bowel complaint, of which he got better. Next time was\r\n on the 3rd February this year for a cold and cough, and boil on his\r\n neck, for which I prescribed. The next week after I saw him, when\r\n another boil had appeared. _On the 23rd of February_ he came to me.\r\n He was very feverish, and his tongue was furred, and had a patchy\r\n appearance, from the fur being off in various places. He complained of\r\n nausea, and had been vomiting. He was prostrate, his pulse was quick,\r\n and he had general symptoms of fever. I prescribed for him (taking his\r\n complaint to be bilious derangement) an aperient draught. He had been\r\n ill, I think, for a day or two, but he had been taken worse the night\r\n before he called on me—during the night of the 22nd and the morning\r\n of the 23rd. He was confined to the house for two or three days. I\r\n visited him on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of February, and on the 1st of\r\n March met him. The aperient draught I prescribed contained magnesia\r\n and soda. On the 24th I prescribed powders containing rhubarb, soda,\r\n chalk of camomile, and ipecacuanha. On the 24th he was much in the\r\n same state. He had vomited the draught I had given him on the 23rd,\r\n and I observed that his skin was considerably jaundiced; and from the\r\n whole symptoms I called the disease a bilious fever. On the 25th he\r\n was rather better, and had risen from his bed to the sofa, but was not\r\n dressed. On the 26th he felt considerably better and cooler, and I did\r\n not think it necessary to repeat my visits till I happened to be in\r\n the neighbourhood. _It did not occur to me that these symptoms arose\r\n from the action of any irritant poison. If I had known that he had\r\n taken an irritant poison, these were the symptoms I should expect to\r\n follow._ I don’t think I asked him when he was seriously taken ill. I\r\n had not seen him for some little time before, and certainly he looked\r\n very dejected and ill; _his colour was rather darker and jaundiced,\r\n and round the eye the colour was rather darker than usual_. I saw him\r\n again eight or ten days after the 1st of March. He called on me, but I\r\n have no note of the day; he was much the same as on the 1st of March.\r\n He said he was thinking of going into the country, but did not say\r\n where. I did not prescribe for him then. On the 26th of February, I\r\n think I told him to give up smoking. I thought it was injurious to his\r\n stomach. I never saw him again in life.”\r\n\r\n “On the morning of the 23rd of March, Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Thuau\r\n called on me, mentioned his death, and wished me to go and see his\r\n body, and see if I could give an opinion as to the cause of his death.\r\n They did not know that I had not seen him alive in his last illness. I\r\n went to the house. The body was laid out on a stretcher on the table.\r\n _The skin had a slightly jaundiced hue._ I said it was impossible to\r\n give a decided opinion, and requested Dr. Steven to be sent for, who\r\n had been in attendance. I examined the body with my hands externally,\r\n and over the region of the liver the sound was dull; and over the\r\n region of the heart the sound was natural. I saw what he had vomited,\r\n and made inquiry as to the symptoms before death. Dr. Steven, when he\r\n arrived, corroborated the statements of the landlady, as far as he was\r\n concerned. No resolution as to a _post-mortem_ examination was come\r\n to that day, but in the afternoon I stated to Mr. Huggins and another\r\n gentleman, who called on me, that the symptoms were such as might have\r\n been produced by an irritant poison, and that it was such a case that,\r\n had it occurred in England, a coroner’s inquest would be held.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, the witness said—\r\n\r\n “_At the time I attended L’Angelier, in February, there were no\r\n symptoms that I could definitely say were not due to a bilious attack,\r\n they were all the symptoms of such an attack. There was no appearance\r\n of jaundice. I have heard of that as a symptom of irritant poison._\r\n It is in Dr. Taylor’s work on poisons. _The jaundice I saw was quite\r\n consistent that he was labouring under a bilious attack, and could\r\n easily be accounted for that way._”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Steven_, physician of Glasgow, who was called in by Mrs. Jenkins\r\non the 23rd of March, at the commencement of the fatal attack, carried\r\non the case to the death of the deceased:—\r\n\r\n “I was applied to,” said the Witness, “early in the morning of the\r\n 23rd of March last, by Mrs. Jenkins, to see her lodger, who she told\r\n me was suffering from a severe bilious attack. Being unwell myself I\r\n was unwilling to go, but advised her to give him hot water and drops\r\n of laudanum. She came to me again about seven. I went, thinking,\r\n as he was a Frenchman, he might not be understood. I found him in\r\n bed, very much depressed. His features were pinched, and his hands.\r\n He complained of coldness and pain over the region of the stomach.\r\n By pinched, I mean shrunk and cold, or inclined to become cold. He\r\n complained of general chilliness and his face and hands were cold\r\n to the touch. He was physically and mentally depressed. I spoke to\r\n him and observed nothing peculiar in his voice. I did not expect a\r\n strong voice, and it was not particularly weak. That was when I first\r\n entered the room. But his voice became weaker. He complained that his\r\n breathing was painful, but it did not seem hurried. I dissuaded him\r\n from speaking, had extra clothes put on his bed, gave him a little\r\n morphia (mustard?) to make him vomit, but he seemed to have vomited\r\n all he could. He had a weak pulse. I felt the action of the heart\r\n corresponding to it. That imported that the circulation was weaker at\r\n the extremities. The feet were not cold. Hot bottles were put to them,\r\n and also above his body for his hands. He was not urgently complaining\r\n of thirst. He seemed afraid of drinking large quantities for fear of\r\n making himself vomit. He asked particularly for cold water, and was\r\n unwilling to take whisky, which the landlady talked of giving him. He\r\n said he had been vomiting and purging. I saw a utensil filled with the\r\n matter vomited and purged. I ordered it to be removed and a clean one\r\n put in its place, that I might see what he had vomited. I did not see\r\n it. I believe it was kept for some time, but I said it might be thrown\r\n away: that was after his death. He said, ‘_This is third attack_ I\r\n have had: the landlady says it is bile, but I never was subject to\r\n bile.’ He seemed to get worse while I was there. He several times\r\n said, ‘My poor mother,’ and how dull he felt at being so ill away\r\n from friends. I applied a mustard poultice to his stomach. I stayed I\r\n suppose half-an-hour. I called again about a quarter past eleven. The\r\n landlady met me and said he had been quite as bad as in the morning. I\r\n went into the room and found him dead. He was lying on his right side,\r\n with his back towards the light, his knees drawn a little up, one\r\n arm outside the bedclothes and the other in. They were not much—not\r\n unnaturally drawn up. He seemed in a comfortable position, as if\r\n sleeping. About mid-day I was sent for again; Dr. Thomson was there\r\n when I went in. I asked him if there was anything in his previous\r\n illness, with the symptoms I mentioned, which would account for the\r\n cause of death, but we were entirely at a loss to account for it. I\r\n declined giving a certificate unless I made an examination, and Dr.\r\n Thomson and I made one the next day. We subsequently made a second\r\n examination after the body was exhumed.”\r\n\r\nThe witness then described how the stomach and its contents were\r\ncarefully preserved and sent to Professor Penny for analysis (see\r\nAppendix A., p. 355).\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Penny_, the Professor of Chemistry in the Andersonian University,\r\nGlasgow, then read the following report of his analysis of the parts of\r\nthe body handed to him by Dr. Thomson, made at the request of one of\r\nthe procurators fiscal of the country.\r\n\r\n (1.) _Contents of Stomach._\r\n\r\n “The liquid measured 8½ ounces. On being allowed to repose, it\r\n deposited a white powder, which was found on examination to possess\r\n the external characters and all the chemical properties peculiar\r\n to arsenious acid, that is, the common white arsenic of the shops.\r\n It consisted of hard, gritty, transparent, colourless crystalline\r\n particles; it was soluble in boiling water, and readily dissolved in a\r\n solution of caustic potash. It was unchanged by sulphide of ammonium,\r\n and volatised when heated on platina foil. Heated in a tube it gave a\r\n sparkling white sublimate, which, under the microscope, was found to\r\n consist of octahedral crystals. Its aqueous solution afforded, with\r\n ammonio-nitrate of silver, ammonio-sulphate of copper, sulphuretted\r\n hydrogen, and bichromate of potash, the highly characteristic results\r\n produced by arsenious acid. On heating a small portion of it in a\r\n small tube with black flux, a brilliant ring of metallic arsenic was\r\n obtained, with all its distinctive properties. Heated with dilute\r\n hydrochloric acid and a slip of copper foil, a steel-gray coating was\r\n deposited on the copper; and this coating, by further examination, was\r\n proved to be metallic arsenic.\r\n\r\n “Another portion of the powder, on being heated with nitric acid,\r\n yielded a substance having the peculiar characters of arsenic acid.\r\n A small portion of the powder was also subjected to what is commonly\r\n known as ‘Marsh’s Proof,’ and metallic arsenic was thus obtained, with\r\n all its peculiar physical and chemical properties. These results show,\r\n unequivocally, that the said white powder was arsenious acid—that\r\n is the preparation of arsenic which is usually sold in commerce, and\r\n administered, or taken as a poison, under the name of arsenic or oxide\r\n of arsenic.\r\n\r\n “I then examined _the fluid contents of the stomach_. After the usual\r\n preparatory operations, it was subjected to the following processes:—\r\n\r\n “(1.) To a portion of the fluid Reinsch’s process was applied, and an\r\n abundant steel-like coating was obtained on copper foil. On heating\r\n the coated copper in a glass tube, the peculiar odour of arsenic\r\n was distinctly perceptible, and a white crystalline sublimate was\r\n produced, possessing the properties peculiar to arsenious acid.\r\n\r\n “(2.) Another portion was distilled, and the distillate subjected to\r\n Marsh’s process. The gas produced by this process had an arsenical\r\n odour, burned with a bluish-white flame, and gave with nitrate\r\n of silver the characteristic reaction of arseniuretted hydrogen.\r\n On holding above the flame a slip of bibulous paper moistened\r\n with a solution of ammonio-nitrate of silver, a yellow colour was\r\n communicated to the paper. A white porcelain capsule depressed upon\r\n the flame was quickly covered with brilliant stains, which on being\r\n tested with the appropriate reagents, were found to be metallic\r\n arsenic. By a modification of Marsh’s apparatus, the gas was conducted\r\n through a heated tube, when a lustrous mirror-like deposit of arsenic\r\n in the metallic state was collected; and this deposit was afterwards\r\n converted into arsenious acid.\r\n\r\n “(3.) Through another portion of the fluid a stream of sulphuretted\r\n hydrogen was transmitted, when a bright yellow precipitate separated,\r\n having the chemical properties of trisulphide of arsenic. It dissolved\r\n readily in ammonia; it remained unchanged in hydrochloric acid; and it\r\n gave, on being heated with black flux, a brilliant ring of metallic\r\n arsenic.\r\n\r\n “(4.) A fourth portion, being properly acidified with hydrochloric\r\n acid was distilled, and the distillate subjected to ‘Fleitmann’s’\r\n process. For this purpose it was boiled with zinc and a strong\r\n solution of caustic potash. Arseniuretted hydrogen was disengaged and\r\n was recognised by its odour, and its characteristic action on nitrate\r\n of silver.”\r\n\r\n\r\n (2.) _Stomach._\r\n\r\n “I examined, in the next place, the stomach itself. It was cut\r\n into small pieces, and boiled for some time in water containing\r\n hydrochloric acid, and the solution, after being filtered, was\r\n subjected to the same processes as those applied to the contents of\r\n the stomach. The results in every case were precisely similar, and\r\n the presence of a considerable quantity of arsenic was unequivocally\r\n detected.”\r\n\r\n\r\n (3.) _Quantity of Arsenic._\r\n\r\n “I made, in the last place, a careful determination of the quantity\r\n of arsenic contained in the stomach and its contents. A stream of\r\n sulphuretted hydrogen gas was transmitted through a known quantity\r\n of the prepared fluid from the said matters, until the whole of the\r\n arsenic was precipitated in the form of trisulphide of arsenic. This\r\n sulphide, after being carefully purified, was collected, dried, and\r\n weighed, and the weight corresponded to a quantity of arsenious acid\r\n (common white arsenic) in the entire stomach and its contents equal\r\n to 82 grains and seven-tenths of a grain, or nearly one-fifth of\r\n an ounce. The accuracy of this result was confirmed by converting\r\n the sulphide of arsenic into arseniate of ammonia and magnesia, and\r\n weighing the product. _The quantity here stated is exclusive of the\r\n white powder first examined._ The purity of the various materials\r\n and reagents employed in this investigation was most scrupulously\r\n ascertained.”\r\n\r\n\r\n _Conclusions._\r\n\r\n “Having considered the results of this investigation, I am clearly\r\n of opinion that they are conclusive in showing (1), That the matters\r\n subjected to examination and analysis contained arsenic, and (2), That\r\n the quantity of arsenic found was considerably more than sufficient to\r\n destroy life.\r\n\r\n “All this is true, on soul and conscience.\r\n\r\n  “FREDERICK PENNY,\r\n  “_Professor of Chemistry_.”\r\n\r\n _April 6, 1857._\r\n\r\n _Examination resumed._—“It is not easy to give a precise answer to\r\n the question ‘How much arsenic would destroy life?’ Cases are on\r\n record in which life was destroyed by two and four grains; four or\r\n six grains are generally sufficient to destroy life, and the amount\r\n I determined as existing in the stomach was 82 grains. On the 31st\r\n of March I attended the exhumation of M. L’Angelier’s body. I saw\r\n the coffin opened, and the portions of the body removed, which were\r\n carefully preserved, in jars of which I never lost sight, and I\r\n analysed the contents, and prepared the following\r\n\r\n\r\n _Report._\r\n\r\n “On Tuesday, 31st March last, I was present at a _post-mortem_\r\n examination of the body of P. E. L’Angelier, made by Drs. Corbet,\r\n Thomson, and Steven, in a vault in the Ramshorn Church, Glasgow.\r\n\r\n “At my request, portions of the following organs were removed from the\r\n body, and properly preserved for chemical analysis and examination:\r\n (1.) Small intestine and contents; (2.) Large intestine; (3.) Liver;\r\n (4.) Heart; (5.) Lung; (6.) Brain. These articles were taken direct\r\n to the Laboratory of the Andersonian Institution, and were there\r\n delivered to me by the parties named. I have since made a careful\r\n analysis and chemical examination of all the said matters, with the\r\n following results:—\r\n\r\n\r\n (1.) _Small Intestine and Contents._\r\n\r\n “The portion of the small intestine contained a turbid and\r\n reddish-coloured fluid, measuring four ounces. On standing for\r\n several hours in a glass vessel, this liquid deposited numerous and\r\n well-defined octahedral crystals, which, being subjected to the usual\r\n chemical processes for the detection of arsenic, were found to be\r\n arsenious acid. Arsenic was also detected in the small intestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n (2.) _Large Intestine._\r\n\r\n “This organ yielded arsenic, but in less proportion than in the small\r\n intestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n (3.) _Liver, Brain, and Heart._\r\n\r\n “Arsenic was separated from the liver, brain, and heart, but in much\r\n less proportion than from the small and large intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\n (4.) _Lung._\r\n\r\n “The lung gave only a slight indication of the presence of arsenic.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Conclusions._\r\n\r\n “(1.) That the body of the deceased contained arsenic.\r\n\r\n “(2.) That the arsenic must have been taken by or administered to him\r\n while living.”\r\n\r\nThe witness then spoke of the examinations he had made into the arsenic\r\nsold by the two chemists, _Murdoch_ and _Currie_, at whose shops\r\nthe prisoner had stated she had purchased it, for the purposes of a\r\ncosmetic. In that sold at _Murdoch’s_, 91·1 per cent. was pure white\r\narsenic, and in that from _Currie’s_, 94·4 per cent., and the remainder\r\ninorganic matter; in _Murdoch’s_ carbonaceous, in _Currie’s_ indigo\r\nand carbonaceous matter. The quantity of indigo in this arsenic was\r\nextremely small, and capable of being removed by peculiar and dexterous\r\nmanipulation, so that the arsenic would appear white to the unassisted\r\neye. If of this an amount sufficient to cause death had been given, and\r\nprior to death great vomiting had taken place, the witness would not\r\nexpect to find any portion of the indigo: the quantity was so small,\r\nthat it would not colour wine of any sort. In the case of _Murdoch’s_\r\narsenic, however, as it was mixed with carbonaceous particles, if that\r\nhad been given and settled down from the contents of the stomach as\r\nin this case, he should have expected to find such particles—not,\r\nhowever, if it had been given a month before. Of the twelve bottles\r\nand two packages of medicines, and the cake of chocolate found at\r\nL’Angelier’s lodging, and submitted to him for analysis, none, except\r\na weak solution of aconite were poisonous, and that was so weak, that\r\nhad the whole two ounces in the phial been swallowed, it would not have\r\ndestroyed life. Of the use of prussic acid or arsenic as a cosmetic he\r\nhad never heard, and believed that both would be dangerous, and the\r\nlatter might produce constitutional symptoms of poisoning. He had heard\r\nof its use as a depilatory, but then mixed with other matters, as lime,\r\nand it was not arsenious acid, but usually the yellow sulphide, that\r\nwas used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination by the Dean of Faculty_, the witness said:—\r\n\r\n “In the entire stomach and its contents there was arsenic equal to 82,\r\n 7-10th grains, exclusive of the white powder first examined, which,\r\n after being dried, weighed 5, 2-10th grains, and was arsenious acid.\r\n I did not determine the quantity of arsenic in the liver, heart, or\r\n brain, and can give no notion of the quantity that might be in those\r\n organs. In the small intestine it must have been considerable, because\r\n when its contents were allowed to repose arsenious acid crystallised\r\n out of that liquid and deposited abundantly on the sides of the\r\n vessel,—which indicated that the liquid had as much arsenic as it\r\n could hold in solution at that temperature. I can’t give any idea of\r\n the quantity in the small intestine. It was decidedly appreciable.\r\n It would be a mere matter of guess, and I should not like to guess\r\n in so serious a matter. If the deceased, when attacked by symptoms\r\n of arsenical poisoning, vomited often, and in large quantities, it\r\n would depend on the mode of administration whether a quantity would\r\n be carried off. If given in solid food, and in a solid state, a large\r\n portion of the arsenic would be ejected from the stomach if all\r\n the food were vomited; but if the arsenic were stirred up with the\r\n liquid, and thereby thrown into a state of mechanical suspension, I\r\n should not expect that so considerable a portion would be ejected by\r\n vomiting. By solid food I mean bread and the like. In the case of\r\n the arsenic being taken in a fluid, I could not say what proportion\r\n might be ejected. I should not be surprised to find that as much had\r\n been ejected as retained. Judging from what I found in the body,\r\n the dose must have been of a very unusual size. There are cases on\r\n record in which large quantities of arsenic have been found in the\r\n stomach and intestines—larger than in the present. I think there\r\n is a case where two drachms—120 grains—were found. In the cases I\r\n refer to the arsenic was taken voluntarily, with the intention to\r\n commit suicide. It would be very difficult to give a large dose in a\r\n liquid. By a large dose you exclude many vehicles in which arsenic\r\n might be administered. Nothing which I found indicated the time when\r\n the arsenic must have been taken. The ordinary period between the\r\n administration of the poison and the symptoms being manifested is\r\n eight to ten hours in the cases on record: that is the extreme time.\r\n There are some cases in which they show themselves in half an hour.\r\n We have cases in which death resulted in a few hours, and cases in\r\n which death has been delayed two days. As to the arsenic bought at\r\n _Currie’s_ shop, the greater part of the colouring matter might be\r\n removed. If you were to throw water on the arsenic, and agitate the\r\n two together, and after the arsenic has subsided you throw off the\r\n liquor, a portion of the colouring matter is thrown off, and if you\r\n keep the vessel shaken in a particular way you may coax the greater\r\n part of the colouring matter away. _Murdoch’s_ arsenic was coloured\r\n with carbonaceous matter—it had the colour of coal soot. I cannot\r\n tell from examination whether the arsenic found was given in one dose\r\n or in several. It would be very dangerous to use arsenic externally\r\n in any way. There are cases in which it has been rubbed on the whole\r\n skin, and the symptoms of poisoning produced—vomiting, pain, but\r\n not death. My impression is, from general reading, that it produces\r\n eruption on the sound skin.[107] If cold water were used, I should not\r\n like to wash in it. I cannot give any other answer.”\r\n\r\n _To the Lord Justice Clerk._—“There are cases in which inflammation\r\n of the intestines has been produced by the external application of\r\n arsenic.”\r\n\r\n _To the Dean._—“Arsenic is an irritant poison; it is absorbed into\r\n the blood, I presume, with great rapidity, and through the blood it\r\n reaches all the organs in which we find it.”\r\n\r\n _To the Lord Advocate._—“In administering large doses of arsenic\r\n many vehicles are excluded. Cocoa or chocolate is a vehicle in which\r\n a large dose might be given. There is a great difference between\r\n giving rise to suspicion and actual detection. I have found by actual\r\n experiment, that when 30 to 40 grains of arsenic are put into a cup\r\n of warm chocolate, a large portion of the arsenic settles down in\r\n the bottom of the cup, and I think a person drinking such poisonous\r\n chocolate would suspect something when the gritty particles came into\r\n his mouth; but when the same and even a larger quantity were boiled\r\n with the chocolate, instead of being stirred or mixed, none of it\r\n settles down.[108] I could not separate the soot from _Murdoch’s_\r\n arsenic, but a very large quantity of it might be separated. Supposing\r\n a person subjected to repeated doses of arsenic, I have no evidence on\r\n which to form an opinion whether the last dose would be more rapidly\r\n fatal.”\r\n\r\n _To the Dean._—“In the case of chocolate being boiled with arsenic in\r\n it, a larger portion dissolves and does not subside. That is what I\r\n find by actual experiment. Coffee or tea could not be made the vehicle\r\n of so large a dose of arsenic.”\r\n\r\n _To the Lord Justice Clerk._—“The period in which the arsenic\r\n produces its effect varies in different individuals, and according to\r\n the mode of administration. Pain in the stomach is one of the first\r\n symptoms, and vomiting usually accompanies the pain, but it may be\r\n very severe before the vomiting actually begins. Ten, fifteen, or\r\n twenty grains might be given in coffee.”\r\n\r\n_Professor Penny_, subsequently (on the fourth day), gave the following\r\naccount of experiments made by him with arsenic purchased from\r\n_Murdoch’s_ and _Currie’s_ shops:—\r\n\r\n “Some of the arsenic I purchased from _Murdoch’s_, which was mixed\r\n with soot, I gave to a dog, and I had no difficulty in detecting the\r\n soot in the stomach of that dog after death. I administered arsenic,\r\n coloured by myself with indigo, to another dog, and had no difficulty\r\n in detecting the indigo in that case by chemical tests. To another\r\n dog I administered arsenic purchased at _Currie’s_, which it will\r\n be remembered was mixed with indigo. After death I detected black\r\n particles in the stomach of that dog, but I could not undertake to\r\n identify the arsenic found with the arsenic given: I mean I found\r\n carbonaceous particles, but that I could not undertake to say that\r\n these particles were of themselves sufficient to identify any of the\r\n particular poison administered. But as I administered it myself, it\r\n must have been the same—at least, I know of no other source. I could\r\n detect no arsenic in the brains of the dogs. I found solid arsenic in\r\n the stomach, as well as in the texture of the stomach.”\r\n\r\n _By the Court._—“Is it the fact that there is less arsenic found in\r\n the brains of animals than of human beings?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I am not aware. In the one case I detected blue colouring\r\n matter of indigo, in the other carbonaceous particles.”[109]\r\n\r\n _By the Dean._—“Did you make yourself acquainted with the nature of\r\n the colouring matter of _Currie’s_ arsenic before administering it to\r\n the dog?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I did.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Did the black particles you found correspond to the\r\n constituents of the colouring matter?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“They have a close resemblance to them, both in physical\r\n appearance and in chemical properties.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Were they not in physical appearance and chemical\r\n properties, identical?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“They were.”\r\n\r\n_Professor Christison_, to whom, on the 11th of May, Dr. Penny had\r\ndelivered similar portions of the body to those on which he had\r\nexperimented, together with portions of the deposits from the stomach\r\nand intestines, made a chemical analysis of the white powder, and the\r\nfluids obtained from the stomach, and the small intestine, and of a\r\nportion of the liver. As from these he obtained unequivocal proofs of\r\nthe presence of arsenic, he did not, at that time, proceed further.\r\nSubsequently, however, on the 28th of May, he analysed a portion of the\r\ngreat intestine, and was satisfied of the presence of arsenic; and in a\r\nportion of the brain he found “traces of arsenic, but not satisfactory\r\nevidence, which might be owing to the small quantity of material he had\r\nto analyse.”\r\n\r\n “The fluid from the stomach,” he said, “appeared to indicate a\r\n considerable quantity in the system—more than sufficient to destroy\r\n life. The symptoms of arsenic poisoning are variable. Sometimes\r\n they pass off quickly, sometimes continue for weeks or months. When\r\n they continue, they are indigestion, loss of strength, emaciation,\r\n sometimes diarrhœa, lassitude of the limbs. If there appeared erosions\r\n with elevated edges in the intestines, I should have been led to\r\n suspect the existence of some affection of the intestines previous\r\n to the final attack. The appearances exhibited by the _post-mortem_\r\n examination were such as the witness would expect from arsenic.”\r\n\r\n _By the Lord Advocate._—“If you had been consulted in a case of\r\n this kind,—that on the 18th or 19th of February a person having\r\n gone out in good health returns, is attacked during the night with\r\n great pain in the bowels, severe vomiting of a green viscous fluid,\r\n accompanied by intense thirst and purging, and after the lapse of two\r\n or three days and partial recovery the patient is again seized with\r\n the same symptoms, though in a somewhat modified form, and that after\r\n the second attack he had continued affected with great lassitude,\r\n change of colour, low pulse, and that after going from home for ten\r\n or fourteen days, had again returned and been attacked the same night\r\n with those symptoms in an aggravated form, and had died within eight\r\n or ten hours of his return, and that on a _post-mortem_ examination\r\n the results were found of which you are aware in this case:—I wish\r\n you to give me your opinion, as a man of science and skill, what\r\n conclusion you would draw as to the cause of the previous illness and\r\n death?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I could have no doubt that the cause of death was\r\n poisoning by arsenic, and such being the case, I should have\r\n entertained a strong suspicion in regard to his previous illness,\r\n because his death would have prevented me from taking the means of\r\n satisfying my mind on the subject by a careful examination of all the\r\n circumstances.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Advocate._—“Are the symptoms consistent with what you would\r\n expect if continuous poisoning was taking place?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“They are those which have occurred in parallel cases of\r\n the administration of doses singly insufficient to cause death.”\r\n\r\nOf the samples of _Murdoch’s_ and _Currie’s_ arsenic, which Dr.\r\nPenny had delivered to him, “The former,” he said, “contained the\r\ndue proportion of soot; the latter was not coloured with the indigo\r\nprescribed by the Act—was not of a bluish, but greyish black colour,\r\nimperfectly mixed, and easily removeable by washing with cold water,\r\nwhich cannot easily be done with good indigo. The proportion was a\r\nthirty-sixth, and not a thirty-second, as the Act directs.”[110]\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of this witness was first directed to the\r\nprobability of the colouring matter in the arsenic being detected in\r\nthe portions of the body analysed.\r\n\r\n “My attention,” said Professor Christison, “was not directed to\r\n colouring matter in arsenic. I got only one article in which it might\r\n have been found—the small intestine. The others had been subjected\r\n to a previous analysis. I was not asked to attend to the colouring\r\n matter. I did not see it, and did not search for it. Supposing soot\r\n or indigo to have been given with the arsenic, I think it might have\r\n been found in the intestines by careful examination. I can’t say it\r\n would have been found: many circumstances go to the possibility of\r\n its being found. Many component parts of soot are insoluble: it might\r\n have been removed by frequent vomiting. It is very difficult to remove\r\n soot from arsenic entirely. Indigo would have been found more easily\r\n from the peculiarity of its colour, and the chemical ingredients are\r\n so precise. _Currie’s_ arsenic is not coloured with true indigo; it\r\n is waste indigo, or what has been used by the dyer. I don’t know how\r\n it is prepared. I did not analyse the colouring matter of _Currie’s_\r\n arsenic. I ascertained it was not the indigo directed by the Act to be\r\n used, and I ascertained the quantity. I separated the colouring matter\r\n from the arsenic, and subjected it to the action of sulphuric acid.\r\n Charcoal (more properly—_carbon_) is one of the constituents of good\r\n indigo, and necessarily of waste. The chief constituent of soot is\r\n charcoal also.”\r\n\r\nThe remainder of his _cross-examination_ was directed to the amount of\r\narsenic found in the stomach, and the symptoms of, and the period at\r\nwhich the effects are exhibited.\r\n\r\n “I was informed by Dr. Penny that he had found more than eighty\r\n grains in the stomach. There was also the white powder in addition.\r\n If there was great vomiting and purging, the quantity of arsenic\r\n administered must have been much greater than that found in the\r\n stomach and intestines. Much would depend whether means were taken\r\n to promote vomiting. If hot and cold water were freely given, that\r\n would facilitate the discharge of the poison. It is impossible to say\r\n the proportion ejected. I think it would be reasonable to suppose\r\n that as much would be vomited as remained: it might, without any\r\n extravagant supposition, be taken at four or five times as much.”\r\n _Symptoms._—“There was nothing in the symptoms mentioned in the\r\n last illness in this case inconsistent with death being produced by\r\n a single dose of arsenic. The ordinary symptoms of this kind are\r\n not unlike those of malignant cholera. _I think all the symptoms in\r\n this case might have occurred from malignant cholera. If there was a\r\n sense of choking and soreness of the throat, I think these are more\r\n symptoms of arsenic._ I don’t think they have occurred in cholera. I\r\n think the ulcers in the abdomen might indicate the previous existence\r\n of inflammation in the duodenum, called duodenitis. It might be a\r\n disease that would present the outward symptoms of bowel complaint\r\n or cholera.” _Appearance of effects of arsenic._—“The ordinary time\r\n that elapses between the administration of arsenic and death is from\r\n eighteen hours to two days and a half. The exceptions to this are\r\n numerous. Some of them are very anomalous as to the shortness of the\r\n intervals. The shortest are two and two-and-a-half hours: these have\r\n been ascertained; but it is not always possible to ascertain when it\r\n has been administered. I had a case lately in which it was five hours.\r\n There are also cases in which it was seven and even ten hours. It\r\n does not appear that the size of the dose affects this; it does not\r\n depend upon the amount taken, within certain bounds, of course; but\r\n I speak of the case as arsenic is usually administered. There are a\r\n good many cases of large doses. I think the dose in this case must\r\n have been double, probably more than double, the quantity found in the\r\n stomach. A dose of 220 grains may be considered a large dose. I can’t\r\n say if, in cases of as large a dose as this, they are intentionally\r\n administered: in great proportion of cases of suicide, the dose is\r\n generally found to be large—easily accounted for by the desire to\r\n make certain of death.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“In a case of murder no such large quantity would be\r\n used? It is in cases of suicide that double-shotted pistols are used\r\n and large doses given.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“But murder, even by injuries, and also by poison, is very\r\n often detected by the size of the dose. In all cases of poisoning\r\n by arsenic there is always more used than is necessary. I cannot\r\n recollect how much has been used, but I know very well that what\r\n is found in the stomach in undoubted cases of poisoning by others\r\n has been considerably larger than what is necessary to cause death:\r\n because the very fact of poison being found in the stomach at all, as\r\n in the case of arsenic, shows that more has been administered than is\r\n necessary, as it is not what is found in the stomach causes death, but\r\n what disappears from the stomach.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“But do you know any case in which so great a dose as the\r\n present was administered?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I cannot recollect at the present moment. In cases\r\n of charges of murder by arsenic it is scarcely possible to get any\r\n information as to the actual quantity used.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“You have information here in this charge of murder.”\r\n\r\n _The Witness._—“You have information as to what was in the stomach.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“And you are enabled to draw an inference.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Of course: my inference is drawn by a sort of\r\n probability, but that is not an inference on which I am entitled to\r\n found any positive statement.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Well, let me put this question. Did you ever know any\r\n person murdered by arsenic having 88 grains of it found in his stomach\r\n and intestines?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I don’t recollect at the present moment.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Or anything approaching to it?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I don’t recollect, but I would not rely on my\r\n recollection as to a negative answer.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“You are not, at all events, able to give an example the\r\n other way.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Not at present. As far as my own observation goes, I can\r\n say that I never met with 80 grains in the stomach of a person who had\r\n been poisoned by arsenic. I can’t say what is the largest quantity I\r\n have found.”[111]\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“If a person designs to poison another the use of a large\r\n quantity of arsenic, greatly exceeding what is necessary, is to be\r\n avoided?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It is a great error. In some articles of food it is\r\n easy to administer a large quantity of arsenic, and in others it is\r\n difficult to do so. It is very rare for persons to take meals after\r\n arsenic has been administered; but there is a case of a girl who took\r\n arsenic at eleven A.M., and at two P.M. made a pretty good dinner. It\r\n was a French case, and the words as translated are, that she made a\r\n very good dinner, though it was observed she was uneasy previously.\r\n The author who notices that case notices it as a very extraordinary\r\n one. She died in thirteen or fourteen hours after the administration.\r\n It was a rapid case.”\r\n\r\n _By the Lord Advocate._—“The amount of matter vomited is sometimes\r\n very little; and sometimes very large doses have been thrown off by\r\n vomiting. There is one case in which half an ounce was taken and\r\n no vomiting ensued. I think chocolate and cocoa would be a vehicle\r\n in which a considerable dose might be given. Active exercise would\r\n hasten the effect of arsenic; a long walk would do so. Exercise\r\n accelerates the effects of all poisons except narcotic. That a man\r\n should take poison at the Bridge of Allan, come to Coatbridge, walk\r\n eight miles to Glasgow, and reach that in good health and spirits, I\r\n should think very unlikely. Cases of protraction for five hours have\r\n occurred in persons who had gone to sleep after taking it. From half\r\n an hour to an hour is the usual time between administration and the\r\n symptoms manifesting themselves. The administration of previous doses\r\n predisposes the system to the effects of poison, and makes its action\r\n more rapid and violent. If the individual had recovered entirely, this\r\n would not be so much the case; but if he still laboured under the\r\n derangement of the stomach, I should look for violent effects.”\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day Professor Christison was recalled, and gave the\r\nfollowing evidence as to the use of arsenic as a cosmetic, its taste,\r\nand its supposed presence naturally in the bodies of human beings.\r\n\r\n _By the Lord Advocate._—“With regard to the use of arsenic as a\r\n cosmetic, do you think it possible to use it, by putting it in a basin\r\n of water and washing the face with it?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It would be very unsafe indeed. I should expect it to\r\n produce inflammation, probably, of the eyes and nostrils, and perhaps\r\n of the mouth. It might get into the mouth, and it would be very\r\n difficult to keep it out of the eyes and nostrils; and if it once got\r\n in, as it is a rather insoluble solid, it would be difficult to wash\r\n it out. A preparation made from common arsenic is sometimes used as a\r\n depilatory. The old name is ‘Arasma Cacoran,’ because it is used by\r\n the Turks. It is essentially a sulphuret of arsenic and a sulphuret of\r\n lime. It is only used for removing hairs from the skin, and not for\r\n the complexion.”\r\n\r\n _By the Dean._—“The common arsenic of the shops, you say, is an\r\n insoluble solid.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It is said in general terms to be so. _It is sparingly\r\n soluble in cold water._ It is not absolutely insoluble, however, in\r\n cold water. _About the 500th part might be dissolved in cold water by\r\n violent agitation, and if the arsenic were to be boiled in the first\r\n instance, about a 32nd part would remain in cold water. Cold water is\r\n the worst of all things to hold arsenic in suspension. Only the fine\r\n parts of the powder would be held in suspension. The coarse arsenic\r\n sold in the shops would fall to the bottom._”[112]\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Suppose water were used to wash the face and hands\r\n without drawing up the arsenic from the bottom, you would not expect\r\n any serious consequences to result?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I can only say, that I should not like to do it myself. I\r\n do not know absolutely what would follow; but, on account of the risk,\r\n any person who would do so would do a very imprudent thing.”\r\n\r\n _By the Lord Advocate._—“Arsenic, though strictly heavier than water,\r\n would remain in suspension?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“The finer parts of the powder would, but not long. I\r\n never made any experiment, but should say it would be for a very short\r\n time. I should say, speaking on mere hazard, in the course of three\r\n or four minutes there would be scarcely any of the arsenic remaining\r\n in suspension, and there would only remain what had dissolved. I am\r\n speaking, as I said, without having experimented.”\r\n\r\n _By the Court._—“_Has arsenic any taste?_”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Your lordship is aware that there is a great deal of\r\n dispute about that. After the strong affirmative of its having no\r\n taste which I published, a greater authority than I—_Professor Orfila\r\n of Paris—still adhered to the description that it had a taste._\r\n All I can say about that is, that experiments were made by myself\r\n and two other medical gentlemen, as far as it was possible to make\r\n them with so dangerous a substance, and we found the taste to be\r\n very slight indeed; _if anything it was rather sweetish, but all but\r\n imperceptible_.”\r\n\r\n _To the Court._—“Then there can be no doubt that large quantities of\r\n arsenic have been swallowed repeatedly by persons without observing?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“The experiments were made by myself and two other medical\r\n gentlemen, and so far as we went we all agreed as to the result.\r\n Professor Orfila maintained that it had a taste, though he referred\r\n to my experiments. But I think I may add, that it has struck me as\r\n very strange, that neither Orfila nor any others who have doubted\r\n these observations of mine on the matter, said that they had made any\r\n experiments themselves. Orfila does not say so. He merely expresses\r\n his belief, notwithstanding what I have stated.”\r\n\r\n _By the Court._—“If taken in coffee or cream, then, the arsenic,\r\n having, if any, a sweetish taste, would not be perceptible?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Not at all. I could put that in a clearer point of view\r\n by a preliminary observation, namely, that several persons who have\r\n taken arsenic largely without knowing at the time what they were\r\n taking observed no taste; some observed a sweetish taste, and others\r\n what they called an acrid taste. With regard to acrimony, however,\r\n there were two fallacies. One was that they confounded the acrimony\r\n with the roughness of taste in the mouth, and secondly with the\r\n burning effects slowly developed by the poison afterwards.”\r\n\r\n _By the Dean._—“In these cases you have spoken of, in what medium was\r\n the arsenic given?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Sometimes in simple vehicles, such as coffee and water,\r\n and sometimes in thicker substances, such as soup. I think there\r\n are some instances where some roughness was observed in the case of\r\n porridge, but I cannot speak exactly as to the vehicles. I do not\r\n think the vehicle had much effect on the different tastes. I cannot\r\n state the quantity administered.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Are these cases in which you were personally concerned?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Strange to say, I have only been personally concerned\r\n in two cases of poisoning by arsenic. I have of course been often\r\n in cases like the present. It only came twice under my personal\r\n observation. It is the opinion of Orfila that the taste of arsenic is\r\n an acrid and not a corrosive taste.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Exciting salivation, is it not?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes, that is a pretty correct translation of the French\r\n word. The word acrid is a professional word, but Orfila uses the word\r\n _âpre_, which rather means rough.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Yes, in his 1st vol., p. 377, he uses the word, but at\r\n p. 357 you will find he says the taste is _âcre et corrosive_.”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I was not aware of that. ‘Notwithstanding the experiments\r\n of Dr. Christison,’ I think he says, ‘the taste of arsenic is acrid.’\r\n He did not say he made the experiments himself, or give his authority.\r\n Orfila is a high name in the medical world; none higher of modern date\r\n in the department of medico-legal chemistry.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Will you tell me the nature of the experiments you made\r\n with the two other medical gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“We tasted the arsenic both in a solid and a liquid state,\r\n and allowed both kinds to pass as far back along the tongue as it\r\n was possible to do with safety, so as to spit it out afterwards. We\r\n allowed it to remain on the tongue about two minutes, and washed the\r\n mouth carefully.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Can you give me any idea how much arsenic there was in\r\n your mouth on that occasion?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“About two grains. One of the gentlemen, the late Dr.\r\n Duncan, kept two grains in his mouth a long time. We allowed it to\r\n remain on the tongue generally two minutes, a time quite sufficient to\r\n ascertain the taste.”\r\n\r\n _By the Lord Advocate._—“Is it a common thing in cases of this sort\r\n to ascertain the quantity of arsenic?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No. In the great majority of criminal cases it is not\r\n ascertained within presumption.”\r\n\r\n _By the Lord Justice Clerk._—“Are you aware that a great chemist\r\n maintained that there was arsenic naturally in the bodies of all human\r\n beings?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I have heard that; but he afterwards surrendered his\r\n opinion.”\r\n\r\n _By the Dean._—“There has been a great shifting of opinion among\r\n medical men as to the probable effect of arsenic, has there not?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Not during the last 35 years. Prior to that our\r\n information as to the effects of arsenic was very vague.”\r\n\r\n _By the Dean._—“Was it not generally thought at one time that there\r\n was naturally arsenic in the human stomach?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It may be so, but it is quite new to me.”\r\n\r\n_Robert Telfer Corbett_, physician in Glasgow, and senior surgeon in\r\nthe infirmary, who had assisted at the _post-mortem_ examination\r\nand joined in the report, was called on the fourth day, and gave the\r\nfollowing evidence.\r\n\r\n “So far as he could judge without analysis the deceased had died from\r\n the effect of poison. The morbid appearances presented were of two\r\n kinds—one showing the result of recent action, the other of action\r\n at a period antecedent to it. The last of these appearances consisted\r\n of several ulcers, each about the 1/16th of an inch in diameter, with\r\n elevated edge, on the upper part of the duodenum. They might have been\r\n characteristic of the effect of irritant poison at the distance of a\r\n month, but it is impossible to fix any date. I think they were such\r\n as irritant poison, administered a month before, would have produced.\r\n They were of longer standing than immediately antecedent to death. In\r\n the duodenum and intestines the body had in colour and otherwise the\r\n appearances characteristic of arsenical poisoning. Inflammation and\r\n ulceration are the effect of inflammation; jaundice, I mean the yellow\r\n tinge of the skin, is an occasional, but not a necessary symptom of\r\n death by arsenic, but not a common one. Extreme thirst is one of\r\n the symptoms, and shows itself very early. It is not characteristic\r\n of British cholera in its earlier stages. The exact time a dose of\r\n arsenic takes to exhibit its symptoms is from a half to one hour—that\r\n is the average time. Longer periods have been known but are very\r\n unusual. They depend more on the mode in which the poison is given,\r\n and the state of the stomach, than on the quantity administered. If a\r\n person had been the subject of repeated doses, the irritability of the\r\n stomach would make it more likely to operate quickly. I have read of\r\n cases of murder where large quantities of arsenic have been found in\r\n the stomach. I can refer to cases in which details were not given, but\r\n the quantity was said to be large.”\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of this witness was mainly directed to his\r\nassertion that the yellowness of the skin seen in jaundice, and, as\r\nhe added, of the conjunctiva of the eye also, was a known symptom in\r\narsenical poison, but he admitted that the statement in Dr. Taylor’s\r\nbook was his only authority: he only “knew it to be a secondary symptom\r\nfrom arsenical poisoning in his routine.” He admitted also that the\r\nulcers on the duodenum might arise from some enteric fever, and that\r\nany cause of inflammation might produce them.\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination by the Lord Advocate_, he repeated that from his\r\nreading and study he knew jaundice to be an occasional symptom of\r\narsenical poisoning. To a question whether “in a person during life\r\nwho immediately after taking food had been seized with severe pain and\r\nintense thirst, he should think, because he had a yellow colour, that\r\nmight not be the effect of arsenical poisoning?” he replied “that might\r\nor might not be,” and “that the appearance of jaundice would not sway\r\nhim materially one way or the other.” This witness, though he had made\r\nmany _post-mortem_ examinations, had only once before done so in a case\r\nof arsenical poisoning. With this witness the medical evidence for the\r\nprosecution was closed.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient, as in Palmer’s case, to give in this place the\r\nevidence of the medical witnesses, called, at a subsequent period, for\r\nthe defence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nTwo physicians were called for the prisoner, with the object of proving\r\n(1), that arsenic could be used without danger as a cosmetic; (2), that\r\nthe symptoms in L’Angelier’s last illness were consistent with the\r\nsuggestion that he died of some form of cholera.\r\n\r\n_Dr. James A. Lawrie_, a physician of Glasgow, many years in practice,\r\nwho was first called, said—\r\n\r\n “He had taken a quarter or half-an-ounce of arsenic, bought at\r\n _Currie’s_, and washed his hands freely with it, and on the previous\r\n Saturday had tried the same experiment with a half-an-ounce on his\r\n face, but washed his face afterwards with cold water. The effect\r\n was the same as using a ball of soap with sand—it softened the\r\n skin. He filled the basin with the usual quantity of water, and\r\n mixed the arsenic with it. It was a practice he should have no fear\r\n of repeating, and would not hesitate in using, if he had a case\r\n that required it, such as vermin on the skin. In consequence of the\r\n insolubility of arsenic, he did not think that increasing the quantity\r\n of arsenic would make any difference in the effect.”\r\n\r\nOn the second point this witness said:—\r\n\r\n “I treated one case of poisoning by arsenic. Some years ago during the\r\n prevalence of cholera, I was asked to see a gentleman about seven or\r\n eight in the evening, and the account was that he had been ill since\r\n three or four in the morning. I found him labouring under premonitory\r\n symptoms of cholera, and I prescribed for him. I returned about ten,\r\n and found the symptoms very much aggravated, and the vomiting and\r\n purging still continued. His voice was not affected, and the vomiting\r\n was not the same as in cholera. It was a reddish yellowish matter,\r\n and I requested it to be set aside. I thought it was not a case of\r\n cholera, and asked him what he had taken. He said only his ordinary\r\n food, wine, &c., but nothing else. The symptoms went on still further,\r\n and I called a consultation of other medical men. He still said he had\r\n taken nothing. I was satisfied from the aggravation of the symptoms\r\n that something else was the matter, and at last he died about three in\r\n the morning. I next day learnt that he had purchased half-an-ounce of\r\n arsenic the day of his death. I had the vomit and contents of stomach\r\n analysed, and discovered arsenic in great quantities. Extreme thirst,\r\n as far as I know, is an early symptom in poisoning by arsenic—but not\r\n equally so in cholera, it belongs to a later stage in cholera.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Douglas Maclagan_, of Edinburgh, who had had some experience in\r\narsenical poisonings, and devoted much of his time to chemistry, had\r\nthe same opinion as Dr. Lawrie of the innocuousness of arsenic as a\r\ncosmetic (mainly from its insolubility).\r\n\r\n “Unless there was some ulceration or abrasion of the skin, or it was\r\n kept long in contact with it. In warm water it would dissolve to a\r\n greater extent than in cold—in which some such proportion as only one\r\n 400th part would dissolve, and if you required to dissolve any great\r\n quantity it must, according to Dr. Taylor, be boiled violently for\r\n half-an-hour, and then it retains about 1-40th of its weight after the\r\n water cools.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Will the presence of organic matter in a fluid interfere\r\n with its solvent power upon arsenic?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“As a rule, it generally will. There does not appear to\r\n be any difference between tea, coffee, or water when poured upon\r\n arsenic. They dissolve but a very small quantity, I do not know how\r\n you can determine whether cocoa or chocolate is a sufficient solvent\r\n or not. You cannot filter them so as to determine the quantity.\r\n There is a great deal of organic matter in the ordinary chocolate\r\n or cocoa, it ought to be entirely organic matter, except so far as\r\n it is water.” (The Witness then gave an account of a case of a girl\r\n whom he attended, who took arsenic by accident, mistaking it for an\r\n effervescing powder.) “We all know the ordinary symptoms of arsenical\r\n poisoning. Most of them are very similar to, almost identical with,\r\n the symptoms of cholera. In the case of slight quantities of arsenic,\r\n it would appear that the symptoms very closely resemble those of what\r\n are called bilious or British cholera. In fatal cases they are more\r\n like malignant or Asiatic cholera.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Can you diagnose a case of arsenical poisoning by the\r\n symptoms?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I believe you may. In the first place the vomiting\r\n would be bloody, from the violent irritation and the pouring out of\r\n a bloody mucus into the stomach—after that has been emptied of all\r\n its contents. I suppose there would be more affections of some of\r\n the mucous membranes, an unaccountable occurrence of an extensive\r\n inflammatory redness about the eyes, and the occurrence of nervous\r\n symptoms, such, for instance, as paralysis of the limbs. But these are\r\n not necessary symptoms. A person may be suffering from the effects of\r\n arsenic without these being produced if the quantity is small.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“You never saw jaundice as a symptom of arsenical\r\n poisoning?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I am not entitled to speak on my own experience, as I\r\n never saw it. There is a single line in Taylor’s book, which says,\r\n that it has been observed, and which refers to the remarks of Dr.\r\n Marshall on Turner’s case.” (Extract read.)\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Is that a description of jaundice?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It is a description of at least one symptom of jaundice,\r\n yellowness of the skin; but it is rather strange that it does not\r\n mention the most common of all signs of jaundice, yellowness of the\r\n eyes. One looks to the eye first in a case of jaundice, because you\r\n see it best there.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Do you think that a sensation of choking and a feeling\r\n of irritation of the throat are symptoms of arsenical poisoning?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n _The Dean._—“Would that occur in a case of British cholera?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I have seen persons who are affected with choleraic\r\n symptoms complaining of being sore about the throat, but it is\r\n generally the soreness arising from what they first vomit, and after\r\n that it is the muscular soreness.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by the Lord Advocate._—“What is it that causes the\r\n yellow outline of the eyes and skin?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“The absorption of the choleraic matter into the blood.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Advocate._—“I presume there is nothing in a case of arsenical\r\n poisoning that produces that?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“It is certainly very remarkable that we have so many\r\n cases of arsenical poisoning where the jaundice shows itself: we have\r\n eruption of those same parts of the duodenum according with arsenical\r\n poisoning. I am not so certain that jaundice is a symptom of arsenical\r\n poisoning.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“But if you saw the appearance of the eye\r\n was much darker than usual, would that lead you to think there might\r\n be jaundice?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Oh, certainly.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“I knew a case of apparent jaundice arising\r\n from a cake of yellow soap.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Advocate._—“Suppose you were told that in a case the body\r\n after death had a yellow appearance, and it was found to be the effect\r\n of arsenical poisoning, would you not be surprised at that?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No, not at the yellowish aspect of the skin, but I would\r\n not expect that there would be marked jaundice.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Advocate._—“And if you found any symptom of that kind,\r\n where repeated doses of poison had been taken during the period from\r\n the time when the patient took ill, what would you say?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“If such a case did occur, I should say that there would\r\n be some connection between the cause of death and the occurrence of\r\n the jaundice.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Advocate._—“In regard to the vomiting, is there not a great\r\n difference in different kinds of arsenical poisoning?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Generally the vomiting is severe.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Advocate._—“You state that the presence of organic matter\r\n detracts from the power of holding arsenic in solution: would you say\r\n the same as to holding it in suspension?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Advocate._—“Is great thirst a symptom of arsenic?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Generally it is, and generally an early and persistent\r\n symptom.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Advocate._—“Is it so in cholera?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I should say that I have seen thirst very early in\r\n cholera. I think it is usually so. I do not know any injurious effect\r\n that would result if the face were washed with water containing\r\n arsenic, if you kept your mouth and eyes shut, but I do not recommend\r\n it.”\r\n\r\n _To the Dean._—“I cannot say how much arsenic would be held in\r\n suspension by an ordinary cupful of chocolate and cocoa. It must\r\n depend upon the kind of chocolate. Cocoa in this country is generally\r\n thin, but chocolate in France is generally as thick as porridge. It is\r\n not so in this country.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF POISON.\r\n\r\nOn the _first_ charge, that of administering poison on the 19th or\r\n20th of February, it was urged on the jury that there was no reliable\r\nevidence that the lovers had met on either of these days, that\r\nMadeline Smith had at that time poison in her possession, or that the\r\nillness which L’Angelier was supposed to have had at that time showed\r\narsenical symptoms. On the 17th of February L’Angelier told Miss Perry,\r\nthe confidante of their loves, that he expected to meet Madeline on\r\nthe 19th, and, from some other circumstances—what they were is not\r\nstated—when on the 2nd of March he told her how ill he had been,\r\nfalling on the floor of his room, she said that “she knew that he\r\nreferred to the 19th of February.” Mrs. Jenkins, however, could not fix\r\nthe date of this attack: it might have been eight or ten days before\r\nthe second illness (February 23), and, like his illness in January, she\r\nbelieved it to be due to bile, the symptoms being something the same\r\nas her own but more violent, on both occasions accompanied by a good\r\ndeal of purging and vomiting. From Dr. Thomson’s evidence, however, it\r\nappears that his first illness in that year, which Dr. Thomson places\r\non the 3rd of February, was due to a cold, with cough and boils, for\r\nwhich he prescribed. The only attempt that Miss Smith made to purchase\r\npoison before that date was that of sending the page boy to Dr.\r\nYeaman’s to buy some prussic acid, which the doctor refused to sell\r\nto her. The Lord Advocate admitted that he could not prove that she\r\nhad arsenic in her possession before that illness. “It would not do,”\r\nsaid the Lord Justice Clerk in his charge, “to infer, from her having\r\narsenic afterwards, that she had it also on the first occasion.”[113]\r\n\r\nOn the second charge, that of administering poison on the 22nd or\r\n23rd of February, the following evidence was offered. On the 21st of\r\nFebruary Miss Smith openly purchased an ounce and a half of arsenic\r\nof the chemist Murdoch, ostensibly for the purpose—a false one, as\r\nthe evidence proved—of killing rats at her father’s country house.\r\nIt was mixed with soot, of which she some days afterwards spoke to\r\nthe chemist, saying she thought arsenic was white. If, therefore, the\r\nlovers met on the 22nd, or 23rd, she had poison in her possession.\r\nWhether L’Angelier went out on the night of the 22nd, his landlady\r\ncould not say:[114] she did not hear him come in, but, when she went\r\ninto his room early the next morning, she found him suffering from his\r\nsecond attack of illness for which Dr. Thomson attended him, and from\r\nwhich he recovered in about eight days. That the symptoms were those of\r\narsenical poisoning was hardly to be doubted, and though Dr. Thomson\r\nat the time attributed them to billious derangement, he said, that,\r\n“had he known that L’Angelier had taken an irritant poison, those were\r\nthe symptoms he should expect to follow.” The evidence that the lovers\r\nhad met on the night of the 22nd, or morning of the 23rd, rested on a\r\nletter, which not only did not bear any date or day of the week, but\r\nthe post-mark on which was so obliterated that the post-office official\r\ncould not fix any date, though he thought he could see the “M” of\r\nMarch on the stamp, which counsel on both sides agreed in considering\r\nan error. In that letter Miss Smith wrote: “I am so sorry to hear you\r\nare ill. I hope to God you will soon be better—-- you did look bad on\r\nSunday night and Monday morning. I think you got sick with walking home\r\nso late, and the long want of food; so, next time we meet, I shall make\r\nyou eat a loaf of bread before you go.” This letter the Lord Advocate\r\nassumed to be written on Wednesday, the 25th of February, and to refer\r\nto the meeting on the night of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. To\r\nMiss Perry, on the 9th of March, L’Angelier spoke of having had a cup\r\nof coffee and chocolate from Miss Smith, which Miss Perry understood to\r\nrefer to two occasions, and added, “I can’t think why I was so unwell\r\nafter getting that coffee and chocolate from her.” “It ought not to\r\nbe forgotten,” said the Lord Justice Clerk, “that the contents of the\r\nstomach on these two illnesses had not been examined, and therefore\r\nit was merely an inference that they were caused by arsenic—an\r\ninference drawn from the fact that on the 22nd of March he died from\r\nthat poison.” With reference to the purchase of arsenic, the learned\r\nJudge added: “He attached little importance to the statements of the\r\ndruggists as to what was said by the prisoner about rats; without\r\nstating some such objects she would not have got it at all; and it\r\nwas not to be supposed, if she had wanted it as a cosmetic, that she\r\nwould tell the druggist. Did she see the deceased on the Sunday night,\r\nbefore the arsenic was administered? Mrs. Jenkins did not see him go\r\nout of the house that night, and he asked the jury to consider whether\r\nthere was, on the whole, apart from the correspondence, evidence that\r\nthey had met together that night? If there was no proof that the\r\nadministration took place on the 22nd of February, then there was\r\ngreat force in the observation that the foundation of the case for the\r\nprosecution had been shaken.”\r\n\r\nOn the third charge—that of poisoning on the 22nd or 23rd of March,\r\nthe following facts were proved. On his return to work, after his\r\nsecond illness, L’Angelier was so altered in health, his complexion\r\nwan, with a dark, hectic spot on each cheek, that leave of absence was\r\ngiven to him, for the first time since he had been in this employ.\r\nMiss Smith had advised him to take rest and change, and L’Angelier\r\nhad apparently told her that he should go to the Bridge of Allan. On\r\nthe third of March, however, Miss Smith writes that her family are\r\ngoing to the same place, and the next day suggests that he should go\r\nto the South of England. On the 5th of March he writes her a painfully\r\nearnest letter on the reports about her intended marriage with Mr.\r\nMinnoch, concluding: “Mind, I insist on having an explicit answer to\r\nthe question you evaded in my last.” Next day the prisoner purchases\r\nanother sixpenny-worth of arsenic, not again of Murdoch, but of Currie,\r\nand this time the excuse is that the house in Blythswood Square is so\r\noverrun with rats, that it is to be shut up and the servants sent away\r\ntill the vermin is eradicated. This again was pure invention on her\r\npart. The family went to the Bridge of Allan, whence on Tuesday, the\r\n10th of March, the prisoner wrote to L’Angelier that they would be home\r\nagain in Glasgow on the next Monday or Tuesday, when she would write to\r\narrange an interview, adding, “I long to see you, to kiss and embrace\r\nyou, my only sweet love.” Before this the Minnoch marriage had been\r\narranged, and the day talked about, if not definitively fixed. Again\r\non the 13th she wrote him: “I think we shall be home on Tuesday, so\r\nI shall let you know, my own beloved sweet pet, when we shall have a\r\ndear, sweet interview; when I may be pressed to your heart, and kissed\r\nby you, my own sweet love. A fond, tender embrace; a kiss, sweet love!\r\nI hope you will enjoy your visit here.” It had been previously arranged\r\nbetween them that L’Angelier should not come to the Bridge of Allan\r\nuntil her family had left.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit of the Smiths to the Bridge of Allan, L’Angelier was\r\ntaking his leave of absence. On the 6th of March he left for Edinburgh,\r\nand returned to Glasgow on the 17th, and, finding no letter for him,\r\nstayed at home all the next day waiting for it. On the 19th he left\r\nfor the Bridge of Allan, where he was to stay for a week, his friend\r\nThuau undertaking to forward his letters. On the 19th, after he had\r\nleft, a letter came, and Thuau forwarded it that night, and it reached\r\nStirling at nine the next morning. That letter was not to be found. In\r\nhis tourist’s bag, however, the envelope of it was discovered, and,\r\nfrom a letter which he wrote to Miss Perry on the 20th, in which he\r\nsaid, “I should have come to see some one last night, but the letter\r\nwas too late,” it may be fairly assumed that it contained the wished\r\nfor appointment for the Thursday night. On the 18th the prisoner bought\r\nher third packet of arsenic at Currie’s. Several dead rats, she said,\r\nhad been found, and it was feared some large ones still remained. This\r\ntime she had a female companion with her, and, as she had to Murdoch\r\nexpressed her surprise at the arsenic she had previously purchased\r\nnot being white, she again used the same expression at Currie’s. This\r\narsenic was coloured with indigo. On the 21st the last of the long\r\nseries of letters reached L’Angelier’s lodgings, and was forwarded\r\nat once by Thuau. “Why, my beloved, did you not come to me?” she\r\nwrote. “Oh, my beloved, are you ill? Come to me. Sweet one, I waited\r\nand waited for you, but you came not. I shall wait again to-morrow\r\nnight—same hour and arrangement.” That letter, which was found in\r\nhis pocket, was received by him after nine on Sunday morning. He left\r\nthe Bridge of Allan shortly after evening service began, and was\r\nat his lodgings by eight o’clock that evening. To accomplish this\r\nL’Angelier had walked to Stirling, taken the train from there to\r\nCoatbridge, where a Mr. Ross found him, and, after some refreshment\r\nat the station, walked with him to Glasgow, apparently quite well,\r\nand walking briskly.[115] When he arrived at his lodgings he appeared\r\ngreatly improved in health since he left on the previous Thursday, was\r\nin high spirits, and said that the letter had brought him back. He left\r\nhis lodgings about nine o’clock, is seen soon after sauntering in the\r\ndirection of Blythswood Square, but not near the Smiths’ house, as it\r\nwas the hour there for family prayers. To wile away the time he calls\r\non a Mr. M’Alister, who is not at home, and from that time till he came\r\nback to his lodgings, after midnight, all trace of him is lost. At two\r\no’clock the next morning the door-bell rang violently; his landlady\r\nwent down, and found L’Angelier at the door, standing with his arms\r\nacross his stomach. He was suffering from his fatal illness, already\r\ntoo bad to be able to use his pass key. How that attack progressed, and\r\nwhat its symptoms were, and what was the result of the _post-mortem_\r\nand analytical examinations, has already been reported.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said the learned Judge, “the proof stops. And, supposing you\r\nare quite satisfied that the letter brought him to Glasgow,[116] are\r\nyou in a condition to say, with satisfaction to your own consciences,\r\nthat, as an inevitable and just result of that, you can find it proved\r\nthat they met that night?[117] That is the point in the case. That you\r\nmay have the strongest moral suspicion that they met—that you may\r\nbelieve that he was able, after all their clandestine correspondence,\r\nto obtain the means of an interview, especially as she complained of\r\nhis not coming on the Thursday, said she would wait again to-morrow\r\nnight, same hour and place, and talked of wishing to clasp him to her\r\nbosom—that you may suppose it likely that, although he failed to keep\r\nhis appointment on Saturday, she would be waiting on Sunday, which was\r\nby no means an uncommon evening for their appointment—_all that may\r\nbe very true, and probably you will think so; but remember you are\r\ntrying this case upon evidence that must be satisfactory, complete, and\r\ndistinct._\r\n\r\n“A jury may safely infer certain facts from the correspondence. They\r\nmay even safely infer that meetings took place, when they find these\r\nmeetings either mutually appointed or arranged for by the parties. But\r\nit is for you to say here whether it has been proved that L’Angelier\r\nwas in the house that night. If you can hold that that link in the\r\nchain is supplied by just and satisfactory inference—remember, I say\r\njust and satisfactory—and it is for you to say whether the inference\r\nis just and satisfactory in order to complete the proof. If you really\r\nfeel that in your own minds, you may have the strongest suspicion that\r\nhe saw her; for really no one need hesitate to say that, as a matter\r\nof moral opinion, the whole probabilities of the case are in favour\r\nof it. But if that is all the amount that you can derive from it, the\r\nlink still remains awanting—the catastrophe and the alleged cause of\r\nit are not found together. And therefore you must be satisfied that\r\nyou can here stand and rely upon the firm foundation, I say, of a just\r\nand sound, and perhaps I may add, inevitable inference. That a jury\r\nis entitled often to draw such an inference there is no doubt; and\r\nit is just because you belong to that class of men to whom the Lord\r\nAdvocate referred, namely, men of common sense, capable of exercising\r\nyour judgment upon a matter which is laid before you to consider, it is\r\non that very account that you are to put to yourselves the question,\r\n‘Is this a satisfactory and a just inference?’ If you find it so, I\r\ncannot tell you that you are not at liberty to act upon it, because\r\nmost of those matters occurring in life must depend upon circumstantial\r\nevidence, and upon the inference a jury may feel bound to draw. But\r\nit is an inference of a very serious character—it is an inference\r\nupon which the death of this party by the hand of the prisoner must\r\ndepend.”[118]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCT AND STATEMENTS OF THE PRISONER AFTER L’ANGELIER’S DEATH.\r\n\r\nIn her declaration Miss Smith stated that she heard of L’Angelier’s\r\ndeath on the afternoon of Monday, the 23rd. On the Wednesday evening\r\nshe was out at a party, and at eight o’clock the next morning she\r\nhad left the house. In consequence Mr. Minnoch, and a brother of the\r\nprisoner, thinking apparently that she had gone to her father’s country\r\nhouse, took the rail to Greenock, and the steamer thence to Row, on\r\nboard which they found her a little after two in the afternoon. She\r\nsaid she was going to Rowaleyn, and they went on with her, and from\r\nthence brought her to Glasgow in a carriage. “When we met her on the\r\nsteamboat,” said Mr. Minnoch, “I asked her why she had left her house\r\nand her friends in such distress at her absence. She made no reply. I\r\nrequested her not to do so among so many people. I renewed my inquiry\r\nafterwards at Rowaleyn. She said she felt distressed that her parents\r\nshould be so much annoyed at what she had done.” The suggestion on the\r\npart of the prosecution was, that from conscious guilt she was fleeing\r\nfrom justice—on the part of the prisoner, that she was fleeing from\r\nthe shame of an exposure of her love passages with L’Angelier. “But,”\r\nsaid the learned judge, “my opinion is, that having made a statement\r\nalready about getting arsenic for the gardener to kill rats, and\r\nknowing that if it had been discovered that he got no arsenic for such\r\na purpose, unpleasant consequences might follow, she wished to see\r\nhim, in order to make an arrangement by which that statement might be\r\nborne out. The steamer in which she went only sailed from Helensburgh\r\nto Gairloch and back, and therefore escape by it was nearly impossible;\r\nand, in point of fact, he did not believe she had any intention of\r\nattempting it.”\r\n\r\nPreviously, however, to this unexplained flight from home, she had been\r\nvisited by the French consul, a mutual friend of the lovers, to whose\r\nsearching questions in the presence of her mother she gave most decided\r\nanswers. As this witness’s evidence was greatly relied on by counsel\r\nfor the prisoner, it is reported in full.\r\n\r\n_M. Auguste Vauvert de Meau_, the French Consul at Glasgow, who\r\nhad known L’Angelier for three years, was acquainted with the\r\nprisoner’s family, and aware from L’Angelier’s own statements of the\r\ncorrespondence between the lovers, gave the following evidence:—\r\n\r\n “I remember L’Angelier coming to my office a few weeks before his\r\n death and speaking about Miss Smith. I said she was to be married to\r\n some gentleman, and when I mentioned the public rumour, he said it\r\n was not true, but, if it was, he had documents in his possession that\r\n would be sufficient to forbid the banns. I did not see her after that\r\n time. I thought that, having been received by Mr. Smith in his house,\r\n I was not at liberty to speak to him; but after L’Angelier’s death\r\n I thought it was my duty to mention the fact of the correspondence\r\n having been carried on between them, in order that he might take steps\r\n to exonerate his daughter in case of anything coming out. In the\r\n evening of the death of L’Angelier, I called on Mr. Smith and told him\r\n that L’Angelier had in his possession a great number of letters from\r\n his daughter, and that it was high time to let him know this, that\r\n they might not fall into the hands of strangers, numbers of people\r\n might go to his lodgings and read them. I went to Mr. Huggins’s office\r\n (L’Angelier’s employer). He was not in, but I saw two gentlemen, and\r\n told them what I had been told to ask (to get back the letters); but\r\n they said that they could not give them up without Mr. Huggins’s\r\n consent, and I then asked them to keep the letters sealed up till they\r\n were disposed of. I think this was on the Tuesday after L’Angelier’s\r\n death. Shortly after I saw Mr. Smith. In consequence of rumours I went\r\n to his house and saw Miss Smith in the presence of her mother. I\r\n apprised her of the death of L’Angelier. She asked me if it was of my\r\n own will that I came to tell her; I told her it was not so, but at the\r\n special request of her father. _I asked her if she had seen L’Angelier\r\n on the Sunday night; she told me that she did not see him._ I asked\r\n her to put me in a position to contradict the statements which were\r\n being made as to her relation with L’Angelier, and asked her again if\r\n she did not see him on Sunday evening or Sunday night, and she told\r\n me she did not. I observed to her that L’Angelier had come from the\r\n Bridge of Allan to Glasgow on a special appointment with her, by a\r\n letter written to him. _She told me she was not aware that he was at\r\n the Bridge of Allan before he came to Glasgow, and that she did not\r\n give him an appointment for Sunday evening, as she wrote him on Friday\r\n evening giving him an appointment for Saturday: she had expected him\r\n on the Saturday, but he did not come, and she had not seen him on\r\n Sunday._ I put the question to her five or six times in different\r\n ways. I told her that my conviction was that she must have seen him on\r\n Sunday, that he had come on purpose to Glasgow on a special invitation\r\n by her to see her; and I did not think it likely, admitting that he\r\n had committed suicide, that he had done so without knowing why she had\r\n asked him to come to Glasgow.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“Did you know of this letter yourself?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I heard there was such a letter. I said to her that the\r\n best advice that a friend could give to her under the circumstances\r\n was to tell the truth about it, because the case was a very grave one,\r\n and would lead to an inquiry on the part of the authorities, and that\r\n if she did not say the truth in these circumstances, perhaps it would\r\n be ascertained by a servant, or a policeman, or somebody passing the\r\n house who had seen L’Angelier, that he had been in the house, and this\r\n would cause a strong suspicion as to the motive that had led her to\r\n conceal the truth. _Miss Smith then got up from her chair and said, ‘I\r\n swear to you, Mr. Meau, that I have not seen L’Angelier not on that\r\n Sunday only, but not for three weeks or six weeks,’ I am not sure\r\n which._”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“And the mother was present?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes. I repeated this question five or six times, but her\r\n answer was always the same. I asked her with regard to the letter\r\n inviting L’Angelier to come and see her, how it was that, being\r\n engaged to another gentleman, she could have carried on a clandestine\r\n correspondence with a former sweetheart? she said it was to get back\r\n her letters.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Advocate._—“Did you ask her whether she was in the habit of\r\n meeting L’Angelier?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes. I asked her if it was true that L’Angelier was in\r\n the habit of having appointments with her in her house; and _she\r\n told me that he had never entered that house, meaning the Blythswood\r\n Square house, as I understood_.[119] I asked her how, then, she had\r\n her appointments to meet him? She told me that he used to come to a\r\n street at the corner of the house (main street), that he had a signal\r\n by knocking with his stick, and that she used to talk to him.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Advocate._—“Did she speak about her former correspondence\r\n with him at all?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I asked her if it was true she had signed letters in his\r\n name, and she said she had done so.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“Do you mean that she added his name to\r\n hers?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I meant whether she signed her letters with L’Angelier’s\r\n name, and she said ‘Yes.’ I did not ask her why.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined by Mr. Young._—“I went to live at Helensburgh in\r\n 1845. M. L’Angelier visited me, and once he came on a Saturday to my\r\n lodgings there, and on Sunday we went on the Luss Road. I went up to\r\n my room, and L’Angelier not coming in for his dinner, I called for him\r\n out of temper. I then found that he was ill, and was vomiting down\r\n the staircase. He once complained to me of being bilious. This was a\r\n year ago. He complained of once having the cholera. Last year he came\r\n to my office and told me he had had a violent attack of cholera, but\r\n I don’t know whether that was a year or two years ago. I think it was\r\n a journey he was to have made that led him to speak of having had the\r\n cholera. I don’t recollect whether he was unwell at that time. I know\r\n that when he came to my house he always had a bottle of laudanum in\r\n his bag, but I don’t know if he used it. I once heard him speak of\r\n arsenic; it must have been in the winter of 1854. It was on a Sunday.\r\n I don’t recollect how the conversation arose, but it lasted half an\r\n hour. Its purport was how much arsenic a person could take without its\r\n injuring him. He maintained that it was possible to do it, by taking\r\n small quantities. I don’t know what led to the conversation, and\r\n should be afraid to make any statement as to the purpose for which it\r\n was to be taken. L’Angelier stated to me he had once been jilted by\r\n an English lady, a rich person, and that on account of the deception\r\n he was almost mad for a fortnight, and ran about, getting food from a\r\n farmer in the country. He was easily excited: when he had any cause of\r\n grief he was affected very much.”\r\n\r\n _By the Lord Justice Clerk._—“After my marriage I had little\r\n intercourse with L’Angelier. I thought that he might be led to take\r\n some harsh steps with Miss Smith, and as I had some young ladies in my\r\n house, I did not think it was proper to have the same intercourse with\r\n him as when I was a bachelor.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Advocate._—“What do you mean by ‘harsh steps?’”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I was afraid of an elopement. By ‘harsh’ I mean ‘rash.’\r\n This was after L’Angelier had given me his full confidence as to what\r\n he would do if her father did not consent to the marriage.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“ Did you understand that Miss Smith had\r\n engaged herself to him?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I understood so from what he said.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“When you used the expression ‘you thought\r\n it right to go to Mr. Smith about the letters, in order that he might\r\n take steps to vindicate his daughter’s honour, or prevent it from\r\n being disparaged,’ did you relate to him her engagement and apparent\r\n breach of it? Had you in view that the letters might contain an\r\n engagement which she was breaking, or that she had made a clandestine\r\n engagement?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I thought that these letters were love letters, and that\r\n it would be much better that they should be in Mr. Smith’s hands than\r\n in those of strangers.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Advocate._—“ What were L’Angelier’s usual character and\r\n habits?”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“Was he a steady fellow?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“My opinion of L’Angelier’s character at the moment of\r\n his death was, that he was a most regular young man in his conduct,\r\n religious, and in fact most exemplary in all his conduct. The only\r\n objection which I heard made to him was that he was vain and a\r\n boaster—boasting of grand persons that he knew. For example, when\r\n he spoke of Miss Smith, he would say, I shall forbid Madeline to do\r\n such a thing, or such another thing—to dance with such a one or such\r\n another.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Cleric._—“Did he boast of any success with females?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Never.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“Did he seem jealous of Miss Smith paying\r\n attention to others?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No; of others paying attention to her.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“It was not on account of any levity in his\r\n character that you discouraged him visiting you after your marriage?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No. I thought his society might be fit for a bachelor,\r\n but not for a married man.”\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“Do you understand the word ‘levity’?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes; lightness, irregularity. There had been a long\r\n cessation of intercourse between us before his death. The photograph\r\n (_shown him_) is a good likeness; he was between 28 and 30 years of\r\n age. I think I got accidentally acquainted with him in a house in\r\n Glasgow.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the case for the prosecution the Lord Advocate proposed\r\nto put in certain entries in a pocket book of L’Angelier’s to support\r\nthe first and second counts of the indictment, which, after argument,\r\nwas refused by the Court. (See Appendix C., p. 359.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with practice of the Scotch Courts the counsel for the\r\nprisoner had the last word; and good use did the Dean of Faculty\r\nmake of his privilege. The Lord Advocate’s policy had been to depict\r\nthe character of the prisoner in the vilest colours—as the seducer,\r\nrather than the seduced, or, at any rate, for a long period the willing\r\naccomplice in all his acts. The Dean dealt not less hardly with the\r\ncharacter of L’Angelier.\r\n\r\n “We find him,” he said, “according to the confession of all those who\r\n observed him narrowly, vain, conceited, pretentious, with a great\r\n opinion of his own personal attractions, and a very silly expectation\r\n of admiration from the other sex. That he was successful to a certain\r\n extent in conciliating such admiration may be the fact; but, at\r\n all events, his own prevailing ideas seem to have been that he was\r\n calculated to be very successful in paying attention to ladies, and\r\n that he was likely to push his fortune by such means. Accordingly,\r\n once and again we find him engaged in attempts to get married to women\r\n of some station at least in society. We heard of one disappointment\r\n which he met with in England, and another we heard a great deal of\r\n connected with a lady in Fife; and the manner in which he bore his\r\n disappointments on those two occasions is perhaps the best indication\r\n and light we have to the true character of the man. He was not a\r\n person of strong health, and it is extremely probable that this, among\r\n other things, had a depressing effect on his spirits, rendering him\r\n changeable and uncertain—now uplifted, as one of the witnesses said,\r\n and now most deeply depressed—of a mercurial temperament, as another\r\n described it, very variable and never to be depended upon. Such was\r\n the individual with whom the prisoner unfortunately became acquainted.\r\n The progress of their acquaintance is soon told. My learned friend\r\n the Lord Advocate said the correspondence must have been improper,\r\n because it was clandestine: yet the letters of the young lady at\r\n that first period breathe nothing but gentleness and propriety. The\r\n correspondence in the commencement shows that if L’Angelier had in his\r\n mind originally to corrupt and seduce the prisoner, he entered upon\r\n the attempt with considerable ingenuity and skill; for the very first\r\n letter of the series which we have contains a passage in which she\r\n says, ‘I am trying to break myself of all my bad habits: it is you I\r\n have to thank for this, which I do sincerely from my heart.’ He had\r\n been suggesting to her improvement in conduct or something else. He\r\n had thus been insinuating himself into her company. She had yielded,\r\n no doubt, too easily to the pleasures of this new acquaintance, but\r\n pleasures apparently of a most innocent kind at this period. Yet it\r\n seems to have occurred to her mind at a very early period that it was\r\n impossible to maintain this correspondence with propriety or her own\r\n welfare; for so early as April 1855 she wrote him—‘I think you will\r\n agree with me in what I intend proposing, that for the present this\r\n correspondence had better stop. I know your good feeling will not take\r\n this wrong. It was meant quite the reverse. By continuing it, harm\r\n may arise, by discontinuing, nothing can be said.’ And from then to\r\n September it did cease.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the correspondence was renewed, discovered, and\r\nstopped by her father until April, 1856, when it is re-opened by a\r\nletter, of the 30th of that month, from Helensburgh, in which she\r\nwrites:—“P(papa) has not been in town a night for some time; but the\r\nfirst night he is off I shall see you. We shall spend an hour of bliss.\r\nThere shall be no risk: only C. H. (Haggart) shall know.” This letter\r\nwas followed by that of the 3rd of May, inviting him on Tuesday, the\r\n6th, to come to the garden gate, and adding, “Beloved of my soul, a\r\nfond embrace, a dear kiss till we meet! We shall have more than one,\r\nlove, dearest.” Signed, “From thy ever devoted and loving wife, thine\r\nfor ever, MINI.”\r\n\r\n “Alas,” said the Dean, “the next scene is the most painful of all.\r\n In the spring of 1856, the corrupting influence of the seducer was\r\n successful, and the prisoner fell. This is recorded in a letter\r\n bearing the post-mark of the 7th of May, which you have heard read.\r\n And how corrupting that influence must have been, how vile the acts\r\n that he resorted to for accomplishing his nefarious purpose, can never\r\n be proved so well as by looking at the altered tone and language of\r\n the unhappy prisoner’s letters. She had lost not her virtue merely,\r\n but, as the Lord Advocate said, her sense of decency. Think you\r\n that without temptation, without evil teachings, a poor girl falls\r\n into such depths of degradation? No. Influence from without—most\r\n corrupting influence—can alone account for such a fact. And yet\r\n through the midst of this frightful correspondence, there breathes\r\n a spirit of devoted affection towards the man that had destroyed\r\n her—that strikes me as most remarkable.”\r\n\r\nThen, after alluding to the precautions with which she sought to\r\nsurround her interviews with L’Angelier at the Blythswood Square\r\nhouse; to the evident proofs that an elopement was projected, and to\r\nthe strong probability that no interview took place without Haggart’s\r\nconnivance, and that, therefore, the interviews at this time must be\r\nlimited to the two spoken of by that witness, he urged that up to the\r\nmonth of February, 1857, he was entitled to say, “without a shadow of\r\nevidence to the contrary, that they were not in the habit of coming\r\ninto personal contact.”\r\n\r\n “We now,” continued the Dean, “come to a very important stage of\r\n the case. On the 28th of February Mr. Minnoch proposes, and if I\r\n understand the theory of my learned friend’s case aright, from that\r\n day the whole character of the girl’s mind and her feelings changed,\r\n and she set herself to prepare for the perpetration of what he has\r\n called one of the most foul, cool, deliberate murders that ever\r\n was committed. I will not say that such a thing is impossible, but\r\n I will venture to say it is very highly improbable. He will be a\r\n bold man to fathom the depths of human depravity, but this at least\r\n experience teaches us, that perfection even in depravity, is not\r\n rapidly attained, and it is not by such short and easy stages as the\r\n prosecutor has been able to trace in the career of Madeline Smith,\r\n that a gentle loving girl passes all at once into the savage grandeur\r\n of a Medea, or the appalling wickedness of a Borgia. Such a thing is\r\n not possible. There is a certain progress in guilt, and it is quite\r\n out of all human experience that, from the tone of the letters,\r\n there should be a sudden transition—I will not say from affection\r\n for a particular object—but to the strange desire for removing,\r\n by any means, the obstruction to her wishes and purposes that the\r\n prosecutor imputes to the prisoner. Think, in your own minds, how\r\n foul and unnatural a murder it is—the murder of one who, within a\r\n very short space, was the object of her love—an unworthy object—an\r\n unholy object; but yet while it lasted—and its endurance was not\r\n very brief—it was a deep, unselfish, absorbing, devoted passion.\r\n And the object of that passion she now conceived the purpose of\r\n murdering. Such is the theory that you are desired to believe. Now\r\n before you will believe it, will you not ask for demonstration? Will\r\n you be content with conjecture? Will you be content with suspicion,\r\n however pregnant, or will you be so unreasonable as to put it to me\r\n in this form, that the man having died of poison, the theory of the\r\n prosecution is the most probable? Oh, gentlemen, is that the manner in\r\n which a jury should treat such a case? Is that the kind of proof on\r\n which they should convict on a capital offence?”\r\n\r\nThe Dean, then, took up _seriatim_ the three charges, examining the\r\nevidence on each in detail, making on each the criticisms, already\r\nreported in the previous summary of the evidence, showing how the first\r\ncharge had failed even in the opinion of the prosecutor: how doubtful,\r\nto say the least, it was that the interview on which the second charge\r\nwas based had taken place, and the weakness of many of the proofs on\r\nwhich the charge of murder was rested. Passing, then, to the suggestion\r\nof suicide, he continued—\r\n\r\n “I might stop here, for nothing could be more fallacious than the\r\n suggestion of the Lord Advocate, that it was necessary to explain\r\n how this man came by his death. His lordship will tell you that a\r\n defendant has no further duty than to repel the charge and stand on\r\n the defensive, and maintain that the case for the prosecution is not\r\n proved. No man probably can tell at the present moment—I believe no\r\n man on earth can tell—how L’Angelier met his death. Nor am I under\r\n the slightest obligation even to suggest to you a possible manner in\r\n which that death may have been compassed without the intervention of\r\n the prisoner. Yet it is but fair, when we are dealing with so many\r\n matters of conjecture and suspicion, that we should, for a moment,\r\n consider whether that supposition on which the charge is founded is\r\n preferable in itself, in respect to its higher probabilities, to other\r\n suppositions which may be fairly made. The character of this man,\r\n his origin, his early history, the nature of his conversation, the\r\n numerous occasions on which he spoke of suicide, naturally suggest\r\n that as one mode by which he may have departed this life. Understand\r\n me, I am not undertaking to prove that he died by his own hand—but\r\n I think there is more to be said for suicide than for the prisoner’s\r\n guilt. But I entreat you to remember that that is no necessary part of\r\n my defence. But of course I should be using you very ill—should be\r\n doing less than my duty to the prisoner—if I had not brought before\r\n you the whole of that evidence which suggests the extreme probability\r\n of that man dying by his own hand at one time or other. From the very\r\n first time at which we see him, even as a lad, in the year 1843,\r\n he talks in a manner to impress people with the notion that he had\r\n no moral principle to guide him. He speaks over and over again of\r\n suicide at Edinburgh, Dundee, and elsewhere—ay, the prisoners letters\r\n shew that he had made the same threat to her[120]—that he would put\r\n himself out of existence. And is it half as violent a supposition\r\n as the supposition of this foul murder, that upon this evening—the\r\n 22nd of March—a fit of that kind of madness which he himself\r\n described, came over him, when he met with disappointment—finding,\r\n it may be, that he could not procure access to an interview which he\r\n desired—assuming that he came to Glasgow for that purpose—assuming\r\n even that he mistook the evening of the meeting, and expected to see\r\n her on the Sunday—can anything be more probable than that, in the\r\n excited state in which he then was, he should have committed the rash\r\n act which put an end to his existence.”[121]\r\n\r\nAgain, in answer to the motive imputed by the prosecution; re-reading\r\nthe letter of the 10th of February, in which on her bended knees Miss\r\nSmith besought him, “as he hoped for mercy at the judgment, not to\r\ninform on her—not to expose her;” asked him “to pardon her if he\r\ncould; to pray for her as the most wretched, guilty, miserable creature\r\non the earth;” told him “she could stand anything but her father’s hot\r\ntemper;” when she wrote, “Emile, you will not cause my death. If he is\r\nto get your letters, I cannot see him any more; and my poor mother, I\r\nwill never kiss her. It would be a shame to them all. Emile, will you\r\nnot spare me? Hate me, despise me, but do not expose me.” The Dean\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n “Is that the language of deceit? Is that the mind of a murderess, or\r\n can any one affect that frame of mind? Can you for one moment listen\r\n to the suggestion that that letter covers a piece of deceit? No, no.\r\n The finest actress could not have written that to him, unless she\r\n had felt it; and is that the condition in which a woman goes about\r\n to compass the death of him whom she has loved? Is that the frame\r\n of mind?—shame for past sins, burning shame, dread of exposure,\r\n grief at the injury she had done her parents? Is that the frame of\r\n mind that would lead a woman—not to advance another step on the\r\n road to destruction, but to plunge at once into the depths of human\r\n wickedness? The thing is preposterous, and yet it is because of her\r\n despair, as my learned friend called it, exhibited in that and similar\r\n letters, that he says she had a motive to destroy this man. What does\r\n that mean? It may mean, in a certain improper sense of the term,\r\n that it would have been of advantage to her that he should cease to\r\n live. That is not a motive in any proper sense of the term. If some\r\n advantage resulting from the death of another be a motive to the\r\n commission of murder, a man’s eldest son must always have a motive\r\n to murder him that he may succeed to his estate; and I suppose the\r\n youngest officer in any regiment of Her Majesty’s army has a motive to\r\n murder all the officers in his regiment—the younger he is, and the\r\n further he has to ascend the scale, the more murders he has a motive\r\n to commit. Away with such nonsense! A motive to commit a crime must be\r\n something a great deal more than the mere fact that the result of that\r\n crime might be advantageous to the person committing it. You must see\r\n the motive in action—you must see it influencing the conduct—before\r\n you can deal with it as a motive; for this, and this only, is it a\r\n motive in the proper sense of the term—that is to say, it is moving\r\n to the perpetration of the deed. But let me ask you what possible\r\n motive there could be, even in the most improper and illegitimate\r\n sense of the term—I mean what possible advantage could she expect\r\n from L’Angelier’s death so long as the letters remained? Without the\r\n return of her letters she gained nothing. Her object, her greatest\r\n desire, that for which she was yearning with her whole soul, was to\r\n prevent the exposure of her shame. But the death of L’Angelier, with\r\n those letters in his possession, instead of insuring that object,\r\n would have been perfectly certain to lead to the immediate exposure of\r\n everything that passed between them. Shall I be told that she did not\r\n foresee that? I think my learned friend had been giving the prisoner\r\n credit for too much talent in the course of his observations on her\r\n conduct. But I should conceive her to be infinitely stupid if she\r\n could not foresee that the death of L’Angelier, with those documents\r\n in his possession, was the true and best means of frustrating the\r\n then great object of her life. Shall I be told that the motive\r\n might be revenge? Listen to the letter, Tell me if it is possible\r\n that in the same breast with these sentiments, there should link\r\n one feeling of revenge! No; the condition of mind in which the poor\r\n girl was throughout the months of February and March, is entirely\r\n inconsistent with any of the hypotheses that have been made on the\r\n other side—utterly incredible and wholly irreconcileable with the\r\n perpetration of such a crime as is here laid to her charge.”[122]\r\n\r\nPassing on, then, to the incident of her sudden flight from her home,\r\nwhen she heard of L’Angelier’s death, the Dean repudiated the notion\r\nthat she was absconding from justice. She had left Glasgow early in the\r\nmorning, and at half-past three in the afternoon was found on board\r\na steamer going from Greenock to Helensburgh. Any one going by rail\r\ncould easily have overtaken her.\r\n\r\n “If her flight means anything,” he said, “it means flying from\r\n what she could not bear—the wrath of her father, and the averted\r\n countenance of her mother. But she came back again without the\r\n slightest hesitation, and upon the Monday morning there occurred\r\n a scene as remarkable in the history of criminal jurisprudence as\r\n anything I ever heard of, by which that broken spirit was altogether\r\n changed. The moment she was met by a charge of being implicated in\r\n causing the death of L’Angelier, she at once assumed the courage of a\r\n heroine. She was bowed down, and she had fled, while the true charge\r\n of her unchastity and shame was all that was brought against her;\r\n but she stood erect and proudly conscious of her innocence when she\r\n was met with this astounding charge of murder. You heard the account\r\n that M. de Meau gave of that interview with her in her father’s\r\n house on the Monday. That was a most striking statement, and given\r\n with a truthfulness obviously that could not be surpassed. What was\r\n the import of that conversation? He advised her, as a friend, if\r\n L’Angelier was with her on that Sunday night, for God’s sake not to\r\n deny it. And why? Because, he said, it is certain to be proved. A\r\n servant, a policeman, a casual passenger, is certain to know the fact,\r\n and if you falsely deny it, what a fact that will be against you. What\r\n was the answer? In answer to five or six suggestions of M. de Meau,\r\n she said at length that she would swear that she had not seen him for\r\n three weeks. If she did not see him on the Sunday that was true.”\r\n\r\nOn the purchases of arsenic, the Dean called the attention of the\r\njury to the improbability of her having purchased it at the time when\r\nshe was urging L’Angelier not to go to the Bridge of Allan whilst she\r\nwas there with her family, and to her throwing it away on the 17th of\r\nMarch, and then buying more on the 18th;—“throwing it away, it was\r\nsaid, when just coming within reach of her victim, and then buying\r\nmore, with circumstances of openness and publicity inconsistent with\r\nthe hypothesis of any legitimate object? Why expose herself to the\r\nnecessity of a repeated purchase, when she had got enough to poison\r\ntwenty or a hundred men.”\r\n\r\n “But,” continued the Dean, “the possession of this arsenic is said\r\n to be unaccounted for, as far as the prisoner is concerned. It might\r\n be so; it may be so; and yet that would not make out the case for\r\n the prosecution. She says she used it as a cosmetic. This might be\r\n startling at first sight to many of us here, but after the evidence\r\n you have heard it will not amaze you. At school her story, which has\r\n so far been borne out by evidence, shows that she read of the Styrian\r\n peasants using it for strengthening their wind, improving their\r\n complexions. No doubt they used it internally, and not externally as\r\n she did, but in the imperfect state of her knowledge that was a fact\r\n of no significance. L’Angelier, too, was well aware of the same fact.\r\n He stated to more than one witness—and if he stated falsely, it is\r\n only one of a multitude of lies proved against him—that he used\r\n it himself. It is not surprising if L’Angelier knew of this custom\r\n that he should have communicated it to the prisoner, and that she\r\n should have used it externally, for an internal use is apparently a\r\n greater danger, which may have suggested to her to try it externally,\r\n and there is no reason to suppose, that if used as she used it, it\r\n would produce any injurious effects. No doubt we have medical men\r\n coming here and shaking their heads and looking wise, and saying\r\n that such a use of arsenic would be a dangerous procedure. That is\r\n not the question. The question is whether the prisoner could use it\r\n without injurious effects, and that she could do so is proved by\r\n the experiments of Dr. Laurie and Dr. Maclagan. The publication in\r\n _Chambers’s_, _Blackwood’s Magazine_, and _Johnston’s_ “_Chemistry of\r\n Common Life_,” of information on the uses of arsenic, had reached not\r\n the prisoner alone, but a multitude of other ladies, and had incited\r\n them to the same kind of experiments. The two druggists—_Robertson_\r\n and _Guthrie_—spoke to the fact of ladies having come to their\r\n shops seeking arsenic for such purposes on the suggestion of these\r\n publications. It cannot, therefore, be surprising to you to learn that\r\n when the prisoner bought this arsenic, she intended to use it, and did\r\n actually, afterwards, use it for this purpose.”[123]\r\n\r\nThen, citing the behaviour of Eliza Fenning, in the well-known\r\ndisputed, and even now disputed case, as a parallel instance of\r\nsuch behaviour as the prisoner showed when taxed with the charge of\r\nmurder:[124] repudiating the doctrine that juries have nothing to\r\ndo with the consequences of their verdict, and that all questions\r\nof evidence must be weighed in the same scale, whether the crime be\r\ncapital, or a mere case of pocket picking, and appealing to the jury\r\nnot to raise their rash and imprudent hands to tear away the veil\r\nProvidence has been pleased to place over this mystery, the Dean closed\r\nhis most effective speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGE’S CHARGE.\r\n\r\nThe most material comments of the Lord Justice Clerk have been already\r\nso fully quoted as notes to the several portions of the evidence, or\r\nto the points made by the counsel for the defence, that it will now\r\nsuffice to give his concluding summary of the case.\r\n\r\n “The first charge is that she administered arsenic on the 19th or 20th\r\n of February. Probably you may come to the conclusion, on the evidence\r\n of Miss Perry and others, that he did see her on that occasion; but\r\n she was not proved to have had arsenic or any other poison in her\r\n possession; and what I attach very great importance to is, that there\r\n is no medical testimony, by analysis of the matter vomited, that that\r\n illness did proceed from the administration of arsenic. If the doctor\r\n had examined the vomit and proved that there was arsenic there, I am\r\n afraid the case would have been very strong against her as having\r\n given him coffee or something before his illness on that occasion.\r\n But it is not proved that that illness arose from the administration\r\n of poison. Arsenic she had not, and there is no proof of her having\r\n possessed anything deleterious. Therefore I have no hesitation in\r\n telling you that charge has failed.\r\n\r\n “The second charge stands in a somewhat different position in regard\r\n to the evidence, although in one respect it is similar to the first,\r\n for it is not proved that the illness arose from the administration\r\n of arsenic or any other poisonous substance. But then the way in\r\n which you can connect the prisoner with a meeting on that occasion is\r\n much stronger. Still if you should think you can acquit her of the\r\n first charge, and that there is too much doubt to prove the second\r\n proven, then you will observe how much this weakens the case that has\r\n been raised by the prosecution on the motives for revenge, on the\r\n change in the tone of the letters, and the desire to allure him again\r\n to her embraces and fascinations, which could not be accounted for\r\n except on the supposition of some such murderous design. In that view\r\n undoubtedly the foundation of the case is very much shaken, and will\r\n not lead you to suppose that the purpose of murder was cherished on\r\n the 22nd.\r\n\r\n “Then as to the charge for murder, the question for you to consider\r\n is a simple one. No matter how the prisoner is surrounded with grave\r\n suspicions, and with many circumstances that seem to militate against\r\n the notion of innocence upon any theory that has been propounded,\r\n still are you prepared to say that the interview of the 22nd March\r\n has been proved against her? She had arsenic before the illness of\r\n 22nd February, and I think you will consider the excuse of using\r\n arsenic as a cosmetic of the same stamp as those which she stated to\r\n the druggists. She bought arsenic again on the 6th of March, and it\r\n certainly is a very odd thing that she should buy more arsenic when\r\n she came back on the 18th. Because unless you are to take the account\r\n to be sure, that she used it as a cosmetic, she has it before the\r\n 22nd, and that is a dreadful fact if you are quite satisfied that she\r\n did not get it and use it for the purpose of washing her hands and\r\n face. It may create the greatest reluctance in your mind to take any\r\n other view of the matter than that she was guilty of administering it\r\n somehow, though the place where may not be made out, or the precise\r\n time of the interview. But on the other hand you must keep in view,\r\n that arsenic could only be administered by her if an interview took\r\n place with L’Angelier, and that interview, though it may be the result\r\n of an inference that may satisfy you morally that it did take place,\r\n still rests upon an inference alone, and that inference is to be the\r\n ground, and must be the ground, on which a verdict of guilty is to\r\n rest. You will see, therefore, the necessity of great caution and\r\n jealousy in dealing with any inference which you may draw from this.\r\n Probably none of you may think for a moment that he did go out that\r\n night, and that without seeing her, and without knowing what she\r\n wanted to see him about, if they met, he may have swallowed 200 grains\r\n of arsenic on the street, and may have carried it about. On the other\r\n hand, if he did not commit suicide, keep in view that that will not\r\n of itself establish that the prisoner administered the arsenic. The\r\n matter may have remained most mysterious—wholly unexplained. You may\r\n not be able to account for it on any other supposition, but still that\r\n supposition or inference may not be a ground on which you can safely\r\n and satisfactorily rest your verdict against the prisoner.\r\n\r\n “Now then I leave you to consider the case with reference to the\r\n views that are raised by this correspondence. I do not think you will\r\n consider it so unlikely as was supposed that this girl, after writing\r\n such letters, may have been capable of cherishing such a purpose.\r\n But still, though you may take such a view of her character, it is\r\n but a supposition that she cherished this murderous purpose—the\r\n last conclusion that you ought to come to merely on supposition\r\n and inference and observation on this wavering correspondence of a\r\n girl in the circumstances in which she was placed. It receives more\r\n importance, no doubt, when you find the purchase of arsenic just\r\n before she expected, or just at the time that she expected L’Angelier.\r\n But still these are but suppositions. Now the great and invaluable\r\n use of a jury after they direct their attention seriously to the case\r\n with the attention you have done, is to separate firmly—firmly and\r\n clearly in your own minds—suspicions from evidence. I don’t say that\r\n inferences may not be completely drawn, but I have already warned\r\n you about inferences in the ordinary matters of civil life, and in\r\n such a case as this.[125] If you cannot say, ‘We satisfactorily find\r\n here evidence of the meeting, and that the poison must have been\r\n administered by her at that meeting,’ whatever may be your suspicion,\r\n however perplexing may be the probability against her, and however\r\n you may have to struggle to get rid of it, you perform your best\r\n and bounden duty as a jury to separate suspicion from truth, and to\r\n proceed upon nothing that you do not feel established in evidence\r\n against her.”\r\n\r\nAfter retiring for half an hour, the jury by a majority in each charge\r\nfound the prisoner _Not Guilty_ on the first, and a verdict of _Not\r\nProven_ on the second and third charges, in which findings the Lord\r\nJustice Clerk expressed his entire concurrence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A., _p._ 307.\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF DR. HUGH THOMSON, M.D.\r\n\r\n “At the request of Messrs. W. B. Huggins & Co., of this city, we, the\r\n undersigned, made a _post-mortem_ examination of the body of the late\r\n M. L’Angelier, when the appearances were as follows:—The body, viewed\r\n externally, presented nothing remarkable, except a tawny hue on the\r\n surface. The incision made on opening the belly and chest revealed a\r\n considerable deposit of subcutaneous fat. The heart appeared large\r\n for the individual, but not so large as, in our opinion, to amount to\r\n disease. Its surface presented, externally, some opaque patches, such\r\n as are frequently seen on the organ without giving rise to symptoms.\r\n Its right cavities were filled with dark fluid blood. The lungs, the\r\n liver, and the spleen appeared quite healthy. The gall-bladder was\r\n moderately full of bile, and contained no calculi. The stomach and the\r\n intestines, externally, presented nothing abnormal. Being tied at both\r\n ends, it was removed from the body. Its contents, consisting of about\r\n half a pint of dark fluid resembling coffee, were poured into a clean\r\n bottle, and the organ itself was laid open along its great curvature.\r\n The mucous membrane, except for a slight extent of the lesser\r\n curvature, was then seen to be deeply injected with blood, presenting\r\n an appearance of dark red mottling, and its substance was remarked to\r\n be salt (soft?), and easily torn by scratching with the finger-nail.\r\n The other organs of the abdomen were not examined. The appearance\r\n of the mucous membrane, taken in connection with the history as\r\n related to us by witnesses, being such as, in our opinion, justified\r\n a suspicion of death having resulted from poison, we considered it\r\n proper to preserve the stomach and its contents in a sealed bottle for\r\n further investigation by chemical analysis, should such be determined\r\n on. We, however, do not imply that, in our opinion, death may not\r\n have resulted from natural causes, as, for example, severe internal\r\n congestion, the effect of exposure to cold after much bodily fatigue,\r\n which we understand the deceased to have undergone. Having no legal\r\n authority for making this _post-mortem_ examination, we restrict it to\r\n the organs where we thought likely to find something to account for\r\n the death.\r\n\r\n “_28th March, 1857_, on soul and conscience,\r\n\r\n  “HUGH THOMSON,\r\n  “JAMES STEVEN.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_SECOND_ POST-MORTEM OF THE EXHUMED BODY,\r\n\r\n_April 3, 1857._\r\n\r\n “By virtue of a warrant from the sheriff of Lanarkshire, we, the\r\n undersigned, proceeded to the _post-mortem_ examination of the body\r\n of M. L’Angelier within the vault of the Ramshorn church on the 31st\r\n of March ultimo, in the presence of two friends of the deceased. The\r\n body being removed from the coffin, two of our number, Drs. Thomson\r\n and Steven, who examined the body on the 24th ultimo, remarked that\r\n the features had lost their former pinched appearance, and that\r\n the general surface of the skin, instead of the tawny or dingy hue\r\n observed by them on that occasion, had become rather florid. We two\r\n likewise remarked that, with the exception of the upper surface of\r\n the liver, which had assumed a purplish colour, all the internal\r\n parts were little changed in appearance; and we all agreed that the\r\n evidences of putrefaction were much less marked than they usually are\r\n at such a date—the ninth day after death, and the fifth after burial.\r\n The duodenum, along with the upper part of the small intestine, after\r\n both ends of the gut had been secured by ligatures, was removed and\r\n placed in a clean jar. A portion of the large intestine, consisting\r\n of part of the descending colon and the sigmoid flexure, along with\r\n a portion of the rectum, after using the like precaution of placing\r\n ligatures at both ends of the bowel, was removed and placed in the\r\n same jar with the duodenum, and a portion of the small intestine. A\r\n portion of the liver, about a one-sixth part of that organ, was cut\r\n off and placed in a clean jar. We then proceeded to open the head\r\n in the usual manner, and observed nothing calling for remark beyond\r\n a greater degree of vascularity of the membranes of the brain than\r\n ordinary. A portion of the brain was removed and placed in a fourth\r\n clean jar. We then adjourned to Dr. Penny’s rooms, taking with us\r\n the vessels containing the parts of the viscera above mentioned. The\r\n duodenum and portion of small intestine were found together to measure\r\n thirty-six inches in length. Their contents poured into a clean glass\r\n measure were found to amount to four fluid ounces, and consisted of\r\n a turbid, sanguinolent fluid, having suspended in it much flocculent\r\n matter, which settled towards the bottom, whilst a few mucus-like\r\n masses floated on the surface. The mucous membrane of this part of\r\n the bowels was then examined. The colour was decidedly redder than\r\n natural, and this redness was more marked over several patches,\r\n portions of which, when carefully examined, were found to be eroded.\r\n Several small whitish and somewhat gritty particles were removed\r\n from its surface, and being placed on a clean piece of glass, were\r\n delivered to Dr. Penny. A few small ulcers, about the one-sixteenth of\r\n an inch in diameter, and having elevated edges, were observed on it,\r\n at the upper part of the duodenum. On account of the failing light,\r\n it was determined to adjourn till a quarter past eleven next day—all\r\n the jars, &c., being left in the custody of Dr. Penny. Having again\r\n met at the appointed time, we proceeded to complete our examination.\r\n The portion of the largest intestine, along with the portion of the\r\n rectum, measuring twenty-six inches in length, being laid open, was\r\n found empty. Its mucous membrane, coated with an abundant, pale,\r\n slimy mucus, presented nothing abnormal, except on the part lining\r\n the rectum, on which were observed two vascular patches, about the\r\n size of a shilling. On decanting the contents of the glass measure,\r\n we observed a number of crystals adhering to its interior, and at the\r\n bottom a notable quantity of whitish sedimentary matter. Having now\r\n completed our examination of the various parts, we finally handed them\r\n all to Dr. Penny.\r\n\r\n “The above we attest on soul and conscience,\r\n\r\n  “H. THOMSON.\r\n  “J.

But, on account of some informality, this indictment fell to\r\n the ground, and the trial was necessarily delayed. Meanwhile, during\r\n the delay, the general evidence was thought defective, and the trial\r\n was dropped. There could be no doubt, however, that murder had been\r\n committed. The arsenic was administered in whisky-punch with sugar,\r\n the arsenic being kept in suspension by constant stirring. The person\r\n survived at least five, possibly seven, hours, and frequently vomited\r\n a yellowish or greenish liquid. Nevertheless, I found a little spirit\r\n in the contents of the stomach; and I collected thirty grains of\r\n arsenic in substance from the stomach and its contents.\r\n\r\n “Drs. Mackinlay and Wylie, of Paisley, who examined the dead body, and\r\n also discovered arsenic in the stomach, had scraped off a quantity of\r\n the powder of this substance from the inside upon a watch-glass. I was\r\n not made aware at the time how much had been thus obtained; but Dr.\r\n Mackinlay now informs me that the quantity was sixty grains. Here,\r\n then, is a case exactly like that of L’Angelier. Ninety grains of\r\n arsenic, and this in substance, were found within the stomach alone.\r\n If to this be added, as in Dr. Penny’s analysis in L’Angelier’s case,\r\n the probable arsenic dissolved and suspended in the contents of the\r\n stomach, and that imbibed by the textures of the stomach itself, it is\r\n impossible to estimate the total quantity in the stomach at less than\r\n 100 grains. But there was also arsenic in the intestines; and, indeed,\r\n it had actually caused purging.\r\n\r\n “How large a quantity, then, must have been given in that instance!\r\n How strangely easy is it for a determined designing murderer to\r\n administer secretly those large quantities of a substance, whose\r\n weight should render it difficult to be mixed, and whose roughness\r\n should betray its presence when abundant! How difficult for the\r\n stomach to discharge it by vomiting. I draw no conclusion as to the\r\n question of Madeline Smith’s innocence or guilt. In common with the\r\n public at large, I am well satisfied that she escaped condemnation.\r\n But, as I have been supplied, through the kindness of Dr. Mackinlay,\r\n with the means of completing a fact, closely touching a ground of\r\n defence, which, at the time it was brought forward, I regarded as\r\n hypothetical and baseless, and which may be made much of again, were\r\n it allowed to stand, as it has hitherto done, I have thought it my\r\n duty to make the true state of the question known.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C., _p._ 342.\r\n\r\n\r\nL’ANGELIER’S DIARY.\r\n\r\n At the close of the fifth day, after putting in the bulk of the\r\n letters, the Lord Advocate proposed to read entries in L’Angelier’s\r\n pocket-book from the 16th of February to the 14th of March, 1857, in\r\n support of the first and second charges. They were undoubtedly in his\r\n own handwriting, and statements of what he did on those days. It was\r\n objected that the book was not regularly kept, that the corroborative\r\n evidence was not sufficient, and that two of the entries were\r\n contradicted by witnesses who had been examined. The Court took time\r\n to consider, and on the next morning delivered the following judgments.\r\n\r\n _The Lord Justice Clerk._—“The admission of hearsay evidence was an\r\n established rule in the law of Scotland, but under those restrictions\r\n and conditions, which went in many circumstances to its entire\r\n rejection. What was now proposed to be admitted was this—certain\r\n memoranda or jottings made by the deceased, in which certain things\r\n were said to be contained, which went directly to the vital part of\r\n this charge. The Dean of Faculty felt so strongly that he did not\r\n scruple to state what the purport of one of these was, in order to\r\n show the immense materiality of the point. It was certainly most\r\n important for the Court to take care that the rules of evidence were\r\n not relaxed merely because it appeared that the matter tendered was\r\n of the highest importance to the case. Before evidence could be\r\n received and allowed to go to a jury, it must be shown that such\r\n evidence was legally competent to be tendered against the prisoner.\r\n That was the rule also in civil cases. It was of vital importance in\r\n considering whether this evidence was admissible, to ascertain in\r\n what circumstances, and, if possible, from what motive, and at what\r\n periods these entries were made. Now it was a most remarkable fact\r\n that there was no entry regarding the prisoner, or the circumstances\r\n connected with her, before the 14th of February; and at that very time\r\n the purpose on her part of breaking off the engagement with him and\r\n of demanding her letters back had been communicated to the deceased;\r\n and his purpose and resolution not to give up the letters and to keep\r\n her to her engagement were avowed and made known, as it appeared\r\n from evidence prior to that date. Then he had a purpose in writing\r\n these memoranda—a purpose obviously to strengthen his hold over the\r\n prisoner, not only by refusing to give up the letters at that time\r\n and afterwards, but probably with the view to hold out that he had a\r\n diary as to their interviews and communications, so as to endeavour to\r\n effect his object of preventing the marriage, and of terrifying her\r\n into giving up her engagement with Mr. Minnoch. He (the Lord Justice\r\n Clerk) made this observation not merely with regard to the weight and\r\n credibility of these entries, but with regard to their admissibility;\r\n because in the case of hearsay evidence one could ascertain from the\r\n witnesses the time the statement was made, all the circumstances and\r\n all the apparent motives which could be collected as to the statement\r\n being made by the deceased. But when we could not know with certainty\r\n the motive with which the man made the entry, or, perhaps, as in this\r\n case, could perceive reasons why he made the entry as against her,\r\n intending to prejudice her in one way, not of course with reference to\r\n such a trial as this, but with reference to her engagement, he thought\r\n it could not be said that this came before the Court as a statement\r\n recorded by him as to indifferent matters, or as to matters in which\r\n he might have not had a strong purpose in making the statement.\r\n Further, it might be a record of a past act. He felt the force of what\r\n the Lord Advocate had said, that supposing in this book there had been\r\n an entry that this man purchased arsenic, would not that have been\r\n available in favour of the prisoner. An illustration of this point had\r\n been suggested to him by a person whose authority and experience were\r\n of the very highest. Take an action of divorce against the wife where\r\n the paramour was dead; would an entry in any diary of his that he had\r\n enjoyed the embraces of this woman on such a night in the absence\r\n of her husband be proof against the wife? He thought not. What was\r\n proposed in this case was to tender in evidence a thing altogether\r\n unprecedented, according to the research of the Bar and the Bench, of\r\n which no trace or indication occurred in any book whatever, viz., that\r\n a memorandum made by the deceased should be proof of the fact against\r\n the panel in a charge of murder. He was unable to admit such evidence;\r\n it might relax the sacred rules of evidence to an extent that the mind\r\n could hardly contemplate. One could not tell how many documents might\r\n exist and be found in the repositories of deceased persons; a man\r\n might have threatened another, he might have hatred against him, and\r\n be determined to revenge himself, and what entries might he not make\r\n in a diary for this purpose? He had a faint recollection of a case\r\n in 1808—the trial of a man Patch for murdering Page, or of Page for\r\n murdering Patch—in which some letter of the murdered man, prior to\r\n his death, was used; but he had been unable to find the case, and he\r\n had no notion if it was of the character he had alluded to. However,\r\n in the meantime, as the point was perfectly new, and as it would be\r\n a departure from what he considered to be an important principle in\r\n the administration of justice, he thought this evidence could not be\r\n received.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Handyside._—“The special point is, whether the entries of\r\n certain dates—two in number—are to be read and made evidence for\r\n the prosecution, as regards the first and second charges in the\r\n indictment. The whole of these entries have been written with a lead\r\n pencil. I notice this to make the observation that ink and penmanship\r\n afford to a certain degree a means of ascertaining whether entries\r\n are made _de die in diem_, thus having the character of entries\r\n made daily; or, on the contrary, of several entries having the\r\n appearance, by change of ink or of pen, of being made at one time,\r\n and so after recollection. Where all the entries are in pencil, there\r\n can be no security as to the time when the entries are, in point\r\n of fact, inserted, and that they are not _ex post facto_; or that\r\n the original entries have been expunged, and others substituted in\r\n their place—whether this be a correction of memory, or with purpose\r\n and design of another character. The party making such entries in\r\n pencil has entire power over what he has done or chooses to do.”\r\n Then alluding to the fact that no authority for such evidence could\r\n be found, which entitled the objector to the evidence to throw on\r\n the tenderer the burden of showing that it ought to be received,\r\n the learned judge continued—“I think the question one of great\r\n difficulty—at least I have found it so. Had the writer of the\r\n memorandum been living, they could not have been made evidence—of\r\n themselves they were nothing. They might have been used in the\r\n witness-box to refresh the memory, but the evidence would still be\r\n parole. What would be regarded would be the oath of the witness to the\r\n facts, time and person; and if distinct and explicit, though resting\r\n on memory alone, the law of evidence would be satisfied, irrespective\r\n of any aid by memorandums and letters, though made at the same time.\r\n It is the oath of the witness to the verity of his oral statement in\r\n the box which the law requires and regards. But if the writer has\r\n died, is this circumstance to make such memorandums thenceforward\r\n admissible as evidence by their own weight? Are they, the handwriting\r\n being proved, to be treated as written evidence? That would be a bold\r\n proposition. Death cannot change the character originally impressed\r\n on the memorandums, and convert them from inadmissible to admissible\r\n writings. They are private memorandums, seen by no eye but the writers\r\n as such, subject to no check upon the accuracy of their statements,\r\n whether arising from innocent mistakes or from prejudice or passing\r\n feeling. I do not say that they are to be supposed false and\r\n dishonest, for the idea is repugnant, from the consideration that it\r\n would be idle to falsify and invent when memorandums are intended to\r\n be kept secret by the writer. But it is quite conceivable that vanity\r\n might lead to statements being made wholly imaginary, with a view of\r\n the subsequent exhibition of the book, and were its admissibility\r\n as evidence set up by death, it might become a fearful instrument\r\n of calumny and accusation. I speak just now of private memorandums,\r\n diaries, and journals, taken in the abstract. As to other writings of\r\n a deceased person, such as letters, I do not say these may not become\r\n admissible as evidence by reason of death, though during life they\r\n could not be used. They thus become analogous to words spoken—to\r\n representations made and conversations held—by a deceased person, the\r\n proper object of hearsay evidence. It was contended that the principle\r\n on which hearsay evidence is admitted would extend to anything written\r\n by a deceased person. It is assumed to be a declaration in writing\r\n of what if spoken would have been admissible on the testimony of\r\n the person hearing it. And on the first view it would seem that the\r\n written mode is superior to the oral, from the greater certainty that\r\n no mistake is committed as to the words used. But this would be a\r\n fallacious ground to rest on, for words written would require to be\r\n taken without explanation or modification; whereas words spoken to\r\n another are subject to the further inquiry by the party addressed as\r\n to the meaning of the speaker in order to a better and more thorough\r\n understanding of the subject of communication, the object of making\r\n it, and the grounds on which the speaker’s statements rest. And all\r\n these things may be fought out in the examination of the witness who\r\n comes into court to give this hearsay evidence. The value of hearsay\r\n evidence, and the weight to be given to it, come thus to depend much\r\n on the account which the witness gives of the circumstances under\r\n which the communication was made to him, as to the seriousness of\r\n the statement and what followed upon it in the way of inquiry and\r\n reply. Now a mere writing in the way of a memorandum or entry in a\r\n book in the sole custody of the writer till his death can be subject\r\n to no such tests. Its very nature shows that it is not intended for\r\n communication. It may be an idle, purposeless piece of writing, or\r\n it may be a record of unfounded suspicions and malicious charges,\r\n treasured up by hostile and malignant feelings in a moody, spiteful\r\n mind. These views impress me strongly with the danger of admitting a\r\n private journal or diary as evidence to support a criminal charge. I\r\n think the question now before us must be decided as a general point.\r\n As such I take it up. If I were to confine myself to the special and\r\n peculiar circumstances of this case, I should see much perhaps to\r\n vindicate the court in the reception of the evidence tendered. There\r\n is to be found in the letters which have already been made evidence\r\n much to give corroboration or verification to some at least of the\r\n entries in the pocket-book. But I feel compelled to close my mind\r\n against such considerations, and to look above all to a general and,\r\n therefore, safe rule by which to be guided. I have come, therefore, to\r\n be of the opinion that the production tendered as evidence in the case\r\n in support, as I take it, of the first and second charge, ought to be\r\n rejected.”\r\n\r\n _Lord Ivory_ said the opinions just delivered had relieved his mind\r\n of a burden of responsibility under which he laboured, and which he\r\n was ill able to bear. He had given the most anxious, serious, and\r\n repeated consideration to this matter. He had found little or nothing\r\n in the way of authority, and no dicta so precisely bearing on the\r\n case as to be of any avail. But judging in the abstract, applying the\r\n rules as applied to other cases, endeavouring to find a principle by\r\n comparison of the different classes and categories in which evidence\r\n had been distributed and in which it had been received, he felt\r\n himself totally unable to come to a conclusion that the evidence of\r\n this document should be excluded from the jury. As his opinion could\r\n not in the least degree influence the judgment, he should be sorry\r\n to add anything that would even seem to be intended to detract from\r\n the authority of the judgment now given; least of all should he be\r\n disposed to follow such a course in a capital case, where the judgment\r\n was in favour of the prisoner. He would content himself, therefore,\r\n with simply expressing his opinion. It appeared to him that this\r\n document should have been admitted _valeat quantum_, and that the jury\r\n should have considered its weight, and credibility, and value.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF ANN MERRITT.\r\n\r\n_Before_ THE LORD CHIEF BARON POLLOCK _and_ MR. JUSTICE CRESSWELL, _at\r\nthe_ CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, _March 8, 1850_.\r\n\r\n_For the Prosecution_: Mr. Bodkin _and_ Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n_For the Defence_: Mr. Clarkson, _by the intervention of the Sheriffs\r\nof London and Middlesex_.\r\n\r\n_Ann Merritt_ was indicted for the murder of her husband, James, by\r\npoison, at Clapton, on the 25th of January.\r\n\r\nMerritt, who was a turncock in the employ of the East London\r\nWaterworks, had been at work in his usual health, with the exception\r\nof a slight cold, on Wednesday, the 23rd of January. When, however, a\r\nfellow-workman called upon him about nine the next morning, he was told\r\nby the prisoner that her husband was sick in the yard, and in a minute\r\nor two afterwards Merritt came in and told his comrade that he had been\r\ndrinking some broth and a cup of hot tea upon it, and expected that\r\nit had turned his stomach. They started off to work, and on the way\r\nMerritt complained of being very thirsty, and went into a public-house\r\nand had some rum-and-water before they separated for their respective\r\njobs. He seems, however, to have soon returned home unwell, as between\r\nten and eleven a neighbour (Mrs. Gillett), who lived next door, who\r\nhad been previously called in by eight o’clock in the morning, saw\r\nthe deceased in his house very ill, and the prisoner emptying some\r\nthick gruel into a basin from a saucepan, and pouring water on it. The\r\ngruel had been made from oatmeal fetched from a corn-chandler’s by the\r\nwitness’s son, at the prisoner’s request, who had given as a reason\r\nfor making it that her husband had returned so very thirsty. This\r\ngruel the deceased was seen eating at a quarter past eleven, and very\r\nsoon after vomiting. However, at one o’clock, Merritt went out again\r\nto work with his comrade, but soon after felt so sick and ill that he\r\nasked his friend to do his work for him, and returned home. When his\r\nfriend returned to Merritt’s house with his tools, between five and six\r\nin the evening, the prisoner told him to go upstairs and see “Jem,” as\r\nhe was very ill, and wanted to see him. This witness went up to the\r\ndeceased’s bedroom, followed by the prisoner, and found Merritt in bed\r\ncomplaining of being very sick, feeling cramp in his limbs; at which\r\nthe deceased said, “he did not wonder, as what with the weather and the\r\nwork they had to do, it was enough to kill a horse.” No more was seen\r\nof the parties until half-past nine at night, when Mrs. Gillett was\r\nagain called in by the prisoner, and found the husband in bed retching\r\nviolently, and complaining of a burning pain in his chest and stomach.\r\nBetween ten and eleven Mr. Toulmin, the doctor, was called in, and at\r\nhalf-past twelve the husband died.[126]\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL AND ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Toulmin_, a general practitioner at Clapton, was first examined.\r\nHe was called in between ten and eleven on the Thursday night, and\r\nfound the deceased in bed sick, complaining greatly of pain in his\r\nstomach and cramps in his legs, his pulse very weak, and his skin below\r\nthe natural temperature; he prescribed for him, and left. Subsequently\r\nhe made a _post-mortem_ examination of the body on the 28th, by the\r\ncoroner’s order, with the assistance of Mr. Welch, a neighbouring\r\nsurgeon, to which the prisoner at first objected. When the stomach\r\nwas opened, it contained a _thickish matter slightly pink_, which was\r\npoured into a stoppered bottle and sent with the stomach to Dr. Letheby\r\nfor analysis. On its coats there were red spots, such as are observed\r\nin persons who have died of irritant poison.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Henry Letheby_, professor of chemistry at the London Hospital,\r\nto whom the stomach and its contents had been forwarded, gave the\r\nfollowing evidence, which, in consequence of the dispute which\r\nsubsequently arose on his statement as to the time at which the fatal\r\ndose was taken, is given in full:—\r\n\r\n “I first experimented,” said the witness, “on the contents of the\r\n bottle (the fluid found in the stomach), and detected 8½ grains of\r\n white arsenic. By one course of experiments I reproduced the arsenic\r\n in a metallic form—it is in this tube (produced). The earthen jar\r\n contained part of a human stomach. I noticed a peculiar appearance\r\n in it, which I have noticed in cases of poisoning by arsenic—_there\r\n was a small portion of whitish powder adhering to the lining of the\r\n stomach_, too small a quantity to enable me to ascertain what it\r\n consisted of. I then examined the intestines that were in the jar;\r\n I subjected them to a chemical analysis, and the result was the\r\n detection of a very small quantity of arsenic. There was also in the\r\n jar a part of a human liver. I subjected about a quarter of a pound\r\n of it to experiment, and obtained a quantity of metallic arsenic\r\n (produced); _it was too minute a quantity to weigh_. That in the\r\n stomach was the only quantity I weighed; that would be sufficient\r\n to cause death. I had the opportunity of witnessing a case where 2½\r\n grains killed; the general quantity would be 8 grains; I look upon\r\n that as an average dose. It would generally be fatal. Vomiting is\r\n almost invariably the consequence of arsenic introduced into the\r\n stomach. A person attacked by that would be likely to throw up a\r\n portion of the arsenic. Looking at the quantity I found, and the\r\n parts in which I found it, _in my judgment the arsenic I found had\r\n been taken not more than two or three hours before death_, but that\r\n is a matter of opinion; a dose might have been given before. It would\r\n depend upon many circumstances how soon it would find its way into the\r\n liver.”\r\n\r\n _Cross-examined._—_Question._—“About two grains of arsenic you say\r\n would cause death; do you mean taken together?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, or less; 2½ grains have done so. I know nothing\r\n of this transaction but from the examination. I found a very small\r\n portion in the liver, perhaps one tenth of a grain in a quarter of a\r\n pound. A liver weighs about 5 pounds, and supposing the arsenic to be\r\n equally diffused, there would be twenty times that quantity—equal to\r\n 2 grains. _My observation with reference to the time it had been taken\r\n was in reference both to the stomach and the liver._”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Are the data at all safe?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes; I will tell you why. I found in the stomach 8½ grains\r\n of arsenic, and there was not much in the intestines. _I conclude,\r\n therefore, that there had not been time for it to have passed into\r\n the intestines, which would have been the case if it had been taken\r\n long before death. But there was only a trace in the intestines, so\r\n I conclude that it was taken a very short time before death._ That\r\n furnishes datum to me to form a judgment on the subject of hours.\r\n Food remains five hours before it passes into the intestines. I am\r\n able to say that the contents of the stomach pass into the intestines\r\n in four, eight, or ten hours, from experiments I have performed on\r\n living subjects. _I have not the least doubt._ I saw the intestines;\r\n they were in the jar. They did not appear to have been influenced by\r\n arsenic; they were slightly red, and there were traces of arsenic.\r\n I have reduced something that was in the intestines into a metallic\r\n state. I experimented on it, and found it was arsenic. It was\r\n destroyed in the experiment to which I was obliged to submit it to\r\n prove it was arsenic. It was not likely that I should find it in\r\n the liver without some being in the intestines. The time would not\r\n depend on the constitution of the person. Digestion depends upon\r\n the constitution, but I am speaking of the average. Digestion is\r\n more or less rapid according to the constitution of the person who\r\n has received the subject matter. I have heard of cases in which\r\n matters which would not digest have remained three or four days, but\r\n those were solid matters. _I think liquids pass into the stomach_\r\n (_intestines_?) _under all circumstances in five hours as_ (_after_?)\r\n _they are imbibed._ There is a valve which prevents solid matters from\r\n passing into the stomach till they are digested. _The arsenic was\r\n in a liquid state, all except a little white powder on the side of\r\n the stomach._ I am obliged to have recourse to an average to form an\r\n opinion as to how long it would take. We have no means of dealing with\r\n an independent case except by an average.”\r\n\r\n _By Mr. Bodkin, Q.C._—_Question._—“What did the contents of the\r\n stomach look like?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Thick gruel. They were filtered, and I examined the\r\n filtered portion, _and my opinion is that the arsenic had been taken\r\n two or three hours_.”[127]\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF POISON BY THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\nThis was proved by the son of a chemist of the name of Brown, of whom\r\nthe prisoner purchased two pennyworths of arsenic on the 19th of\r\nJanuary, which, at her request, he enclosed in two separate papers,\r\neach marked “poison,” as she said that one of them was for her sister\r\nwho lived some distance off. The papers had something of the appearance\r\nof those of effervescing powders.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCT AND STATEMENTS OF THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Gillett_ gave some remarkable evidence as to the statements and\r\nconduct of the prisoner during the night of her husband’s fatal illness\r\nand after his death.\r\n\r\n “When the prisoner called me in a little after nine in the evening,\r\n I found her husband in bed retching violently, and I gave him water\r\n half-a-dozen times, and then went for Dr. Toulmin. At five o’clock\r\n that day the prisoner said she was going for the doctor, to tell\r\n him to send her husband something for the bile, but that he did not\r\n want her to do so. A second time during the evening she told me she\r\n wanted to do this, and that he would not let her, and that she had\r\n applied to a neighbouring doctor, but that he had refused to come,\r\n and only sent some pills. After her husband died she said, ‘How true\r\n were Dr. Toulmin’s words,’ that, ‘when her husband once took to his\r\n bed, he would go off like the snuff of a candle.’” [Dr. Toulmin had\r\n no recollection of ever having made such a statement.] “Next day the\r\n secretary of the Benefit Society to which her husband belonged called\r\n and had some conversation with her. Before that she had spoken to me\r\n about the Benefit Society, and said if her husband died she should\r\n have the full benefit of it. On the day of the _post-mortem_ she asked\r\n me if I had asked Dr. Toulmin what was the cause of death, and I said,\r\n from what I heard, it was poison; when she said, ‘Do you think I am\r\n guilty?’ I replied, ‘I do not doubt you.’ Then she walked about in an\r\n agitated manner and appeared distressed. On the day of the inquest\r\n she said to me, ‘You know, Mrs. Gillett, that Annie (her little girl)\r\n ate the rest of the gruel.’ I said ‘Don’t say so; I did not see any\r\n of you eat it.’ She said, ‘If I did not _Ashby_ did, and he ought to\r\n be the first witness’ (_Ashby_ said he did not see the deceased or\r\n anyone eat it). On the day of the adjourned inquest she asked me if\r\n poison had been found, and when I said ‘Yes’ she said ‘I am innocent;\r\n he was a good husband, and it is not likely I should do such a thing.\r\n Dear creature; if that is the case he has done it with his own hands.’\r\n I replied ‘It is not likely, as he purchased a new pair of boots the\r\n morning before his death.’ Whilst we were talking _Andrews_, the\r\n summoning officer, came in, and she said to him ‘Mrs. Gillett knows\r\n that I ate the rest of the gruel,’ and I replied ‘I know nothing about\r\n it, or who ate it.’[128] On the 31st of January in her house she said\r\n to me ‘Do you think if I had any hand in his death I should not have\r\n let him live to to-day and then have received the full benefit from\r\n the society.’”[129]\r\n\r\n _On cross-examination_ the witness protested that she had repeated\r\n these conversations before, and was almost certain she had done so\r\n before the coroner and the magistrate. When she said ‘I did not doubt\r\n her,’ she meant that she had not the slightest suspicion of her\r\n guilt. The witness had introduced the subject of the burial club.\r\n The prisoner was kind and affectionate to her husband, and attentive\r\n during his illness, and much distressed. The witness had heard the\r\n deceased complain of the difficulties into which his wife had plunged\r\n him, and on the Monday before he was taken ill they had quarrelled.\r\n\r\nOther statements of a most unfavourable character were improperly\r\nextracted from her by _Coward_, the inspector of police. As the Lord\r\nChief Baron said, with well-deserved reproof, he had evidently prepared\r\na proceeding, and framed certain questions, which would enable him to\r\nobserve the demeanour of the prisoner when she was confronted with\r\na witness ready in attendance, in order to give his own view of her\r\nconduct afterwards to the jury.\r\n\r\n “I,” said this witness, “saw the prisoner on the 2nd of February in\r\n her house, and told her I had come to ask a few questions, which she\r\n might answer or not as she pleased, but that it would be my duty to\r\n repeat her answers to the magistrate; that I should like to have some\r\n women present to hear, and accordingly sent for two of her neighbours,\r\n and when they had come I asked her ‘Did she know of any arsenic being\r\n in the house?’ ‘No.’ ‘Did her husband use it in his business?’ ‘No.’\r\n ‘Had she purchased any lately?’ ‘No.’ _Brown_ was then brought in, and\r\n she turned pale and agitated. I told her _Brown_ had told me she had,\r\n and she said ‘That was true, and she would tell me what for.’ On the\r\n way to the police court she said ‘she purchased it for herself, but\r\n thought better of it afterwards.’ I asked her what had become of it\r\n afterwards, and she said ‘she had emptied it into one paper.’ She then\r\n changed the conversation, and said that her husband was very fond of\r\n soda and acid powders, and that a woman had told her that he had said\r\n he was very troubled in his mind, and did not know whether he should\r\n not jump into the river or Clapton pond.”\r\n\r\n _On cross-examination_ he excused the presence of the women, on the\r\n ground that he wanted to see if _Brown_ could identify the prisoner;\r\n that she wanted to say more but that he stopt her, and told her to\r\n tell the magistrate.\r\n\r\nOf this last statement of the inspector, the Lord Chief Baron added in\r\nhis charge—\r\n\r\n “That it appeared to him to be a piece of hypocrisy, which accorded\r\n with all the rest of his conduct. He wished it to go forth to the\r\n public, and that the police themselves should understand, that\r\n such proceedings savoured of an excess of zeal which was perfectly\r\n unjustifiable, and which ought not to be looked on in any other light\r\n than discreditable.”\r\n\r\nTo _Clarke_, a police constable, she said, whilst in custody, that “she\r\nsupposed she should be hung—they had told so many lies about it—she\r\nbought the arsenic for her husband.” To the female searcher at the\r\npolice-station she said that she did not know on what charge she was\r\nbrought there; and then, when told it, added, “I know he was poisoned,\r\nbut not by whom.” And when told that _Mrs. Gillett_ was the principal\r\nwitness against her, declared that she was forsworn. On the second\r\nexamination at the police-court, she told the gaoler that “she wished\r\nthe magistrate to know something about the case. All she had said was\r\ntrue, except as to not buying the poison. She had placed it in the same\r\ncupboard with her husband’s powders after taking off the papers marked\r\n‘poison.’ If he had taken it, it must have been by mistake, and she\r\nthrew the remainder of the poison and all his powders into the fire.\r\nShe intended to have taken it herself if he went on as he had done.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER’S STATEMENT.\r\n\r\n “I have nothing to say except that I never intended my husband to take\r\n the poison. When I bought it I intended to take it myself, if he had\r\n come home as he had done several times before. I could not live with\r\n him had he gone on so. I thought no more of it till the Sunday, when I\r\n thought he might have taken it instead of the soda, and then I burnt\r\n it. What I said about hanging was this—‘If I am to be hanged this\r\n moment I am innocent of anything to my husband.’ I have nothing more\r\n to say.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Clarkson_, for the defence, after alluding to the difficulties\r\nunder which he laboured in consequence of the prisoner not having\r\nmade any preparations for her defence, and the brief having only been\r\nhanded to him as the case was opened, attacked the evidence of Coward\r\nin language which the Lord Chief Baron entirely adopted, and asked the\r\njury to dismiss it from their consideration. He also characterised the\r\ndeclarations of the prisoner as told by witnesses clearly unfavourable\r\nto her. “With regard to the testimony of Dr. Letheby, if they relied\r\non it, it would be necessary,” he said, “to come to the conclusion\r\nthat the prisoner had continued administering poison to the deceased\r\nduring the whole of the day—as it was proved that he was ill as early\r\nas eight in the morning. But he asked the jury if her conduct would\r\njustify such a conclusion. Her story might be true, and if the deceased\r\ntook the poison through her culpable negligence in putting it in the\r\ncupboard with his soda powders, the offence would not be murder, but\r\nmanslaughter.”\r\n\r\nThe strong remarks of the Lord Chief Baron on the conduct and evidence\r\nof Coward have already been given, and as the remainder of his charge\r\nconsisted only of an analysis of the evidence, and its application\r\nto the different points of the case, it is needless to report it.\r\nAs was characteristic of this kind judge, every point that could be\r\nmade in favour of the prisoner was brought clearly out in his able\r\ncharge. After a brief deliberation, a verdict of guilty, coupled with\r\na recommendation to mercy on account of her previously good character,\r\nwas returned, and sentence of death was pronounced by the learned judge.\r\n\r\nA medical man of large experience, who was present during the trial,\r\nwas so astonished at the statement of Dr. Letheby as to the time when\r\nthe arsenic had been administered, that he communicated with the\r\nsheriffs, who brought the case before Sir George Grey, by whom it was\r\nreferred to Sir Benjamin Brodie, Dr. Billing, Dr. Leeson, and other\r\nmedical men of repute. These, it was understood, agreed that the time\r\nof administration could not be fixed. On this, at the urgent request\r\nof Dr. Pereira, Dr. Letheby wrote to the Home Secretary that it was\r\nhis duty to admit that it was within the range of possibility—nay,\r\neven probable—that the arsenic might have been taken, as the\r\nwoman asserted, early in the morning of her husband’s death, and\r\nin consequence the capital sentence was commuted for one of penal\r\nservitude for life. This case was used by Mr. Bright in his speech in\r\nthe House of Commons in favour of the abolition of capital punishments,\r\nas a strong example of their danger.\r\n\r\nHow much more satisfactory would it have been could a court of appeal\r\nhave reheard such a case instead of its being left to the Home\r\nSecretary’s judgment of evidence known only to himself.[130]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nARSENIC.\r\n\r\n The element (arsenicum)—The oxide (white\r\n arsenic)—Arsenicum—Arsenicum trioxide.

In\r\nour report, the element will be called _arsenicum_, the oxide simply\r\n“arsenic” or “white arsenic.”\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENICUM,\r\n\r\nSymbol As, is an element of steely metallic lustre, tarnishing to dull\r\ndark grey, met with in crystalline (rhombohedral) fragments, so brittle\r\nthat they can be easily reduced to a dark grey powder, insoluble\r\nin water, but slowly absorbing oxygen and dissolving, insoluble in\r\npure hydrochloric and in vegetal acids, and in alcohol, soluble (by\r\noxidation) in strong sulphuric and in nitric acid, in chlorine, in\r\nsolution of bleaching powder. Tasteless, and inodorous until heated,\r\nwhen it sublimes, without melting, at 110° C. (Guy), and gives a\r\nstrong _odour of garlic_. Sp. gr. 5·8. The characters of the metal are\r\nutilized in Marsh’s and other tests, hereafter described. Heated in\r\nair, it oxidizes to white fumes of As_{2}O_{3}. It is employed chiefly\r\nto harden lead in making _shot_, in the proportion of 0·3 per cent. The\r\nuse of these in cleaning bottles, &c., may contribute a trace of As:\r\nthe presence of a larger amount of _lead_ would in this case indicate\r\nthe source. Common Britannia metal, used for teapots, spoons, &c.,\r\noften contains As. It occurs also in many minerals.\r\n\r\nWhen oxidized it is poisonous, but _pure arsenicum_ passes through\r\nthe body of animals unaltered (Wagner’s Chem. Technology, trans, by\r\nCrookes, 1872, p. 86). The vapour is very poisonous.\r\n\r\nArsenicum has two oxides, the trioxide and the pentoxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENICUM TRIOXIDE.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms._—Arsenious oxide, arsenious acid, arsenious anhydride;\r\npopularly, “arsenic,” “flour of arsenic,” or “white arsenic:” in mining\r\ndistricts it is sometimes called “mercury:” Latin, acidum arseniosum.\r\n\r\n_Chemical formula_ As_{2}O_{3}, or two atoms (150 parts by weight) of\r\narsenicum, to three atoms (48 parts by weight) of oxygen.\r\n\r\n_Forms._—(1.) _Crystalline_. By sublimation and slow condensation on\r\nmoderately heated surfaces, also by deposition from solution, we obtain\r\nregular _octahedra_, often so modified as to appear like equilateral\r\ntriangular or hexagonal plates, or even elongated into triangular\r\nprisms, but never in the form of regular _tetrahedra_ such as tartar\r\nemetic yields. For figures, see Guy and Ferrier’s Forens. Med., 1881,\r\npp. 440 and 670. The crystals are transparent and highly refracting.\r\nSp. gr. 3·69. Volatilizes without melting, except under increased\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n(2.) _Amorphous_ or _vitreous_. Suddenly cooled, As_{2}O_{3} condenses\r\nas clear transparent drops, finally cohering into a glassy mass, sp.\r\ngr. 3·74. When kept, this becomes opaque, perhaps owing to a change\r\ninto the crystalline variety, constituting the “porcellanous” form\r\nfound in commerce. If the lumps be broken, layers of still transparent\r\nAs_{2}O_{3} will be seen.\r\n\r\nThe _solubility_ depends on the variety, temperature, length of time\r\nit is digested, fineness of powder, &c. So that exact figures cannot\r\nbe given, as hardly two authorities agree. It is certain, however,\r\nthat the amorphous form is less soluble than the crystalline.[131]\r\nThe accepted statement is that given by Taylor (Med. Juris. 1, 250):\r\nthat digested with cold water, from 1/500 to 1/1000 dissolves, equal\r\nfrom one half to one grain per fluid ounce; if boiled for an hour and\r\nallowed to cool, an average of twelve grains per fluid ounce remains\r\nin solution; if boiled for a shorter time, less is dissolved. See also\r\nWoodman and Tidy’s Forens. Med., 1877, pp. 133, 134. Organic matter\r\nis said to decrease its solubility; I have not found that it does so\r\nto any notable extent. Dr. Blondlot (Med. Times and Gazette, Feb. 11,\r\n1860) states that fats, such as bacon, diminish the solubility; this\r\nmust be by coating the particles and preventing contact with water.\r\nPowdered white arsenic in all cases refuses for a long time to become\r\nmoistened by water, floating on the top, and collecting in little lumps\r\nas if greasy: the appearance is so peculiar as to have led sometimes\r\nto its detection. Commercial powdered white arsenic is generally the\r\nopaque form pulverized, but it may be crystalline.\r\n\r\nAs_{2}O_{3} is very soluble in potash and soda and their carbonates,\r\nforming _arsenites_. It is less soluble in ammonia. In hydrochloric\r\nacid it dissolves easily, forming _chloride of arsenic_. It is less\r\nsoluble (1 in 2,000) in alcohol than in water. One part dissolves in\r\n200,000 of chloroform. It is insoluble in pure ether. It is heavy to\r\nfeel, _tasteless_, very faintly acid to test paper, and so feeble\r\nin affinity that its soluble salts are strongly alkaline, and are\r\ndecomposed by all acids with separation of As_{2}O_{3}. The powder and\r\nits vapour are inodorous, but when heated with charcoal or organic\r\nmatter it is reduced to arsenicum, with its odour of garlic.\r\n\r\n_Uses and Occurrence._—1. As a preservative against insects and fungi,\r\nfor steeping seed-wheat. Many accidents have resulted. Birds poisoned\r\nby it and afterwards eaten by man have occasioned severe symptoms. From\r\n1830 to 1840 in France 235 accusations of arsenic poisoning occurred,\r\nof which 110 were against agricultural persons, proving that the use of\r\nthe drug in farming gives dangerous facilities for crime. Sulphate of\r\ncopper, or, better, a mixture of sulphate of soda and lime, are more\r\neffectual as preservatives, and the latter mixture is not poisonous.\r\n(Lancet, 1849, Jan. 20.)\r\n\r\n2. For preserving skins and furs (arsenical soap). This use has also\r\ncaused serious results in the operators. Stuffed birds, &c., kept\r\nin living rooms may prejudicially affect the inmates by giving off\r\narsenical dust.\r\n\r\n3. As an antiseptic it is injected in solution through the vessels of\r\nsubjects for dissection. Of course in this case the body would show\r\nsigns of the anatomical examination it had undergone. In the trial\r\nof Professor Webster for the murder of Dr. Parkman, at Boston, U.S.,\r\nMarch, 1850, the _absence_ of arsenic and other preservative substances\r\nin the corpse proved that it had not been a subject for dissection.\r\n\r\n4. In glass making and the production of opaque white enamels. Here\r\nmost of the vapour passes up the chimney and is diffused.\r\n\r\n5. Some of the patent preparations for preventing “fur” in boilers have\r\ncontained alkaline arsenites.\r\n\r\n6. Formerly wicks of candles were steeped in arsenic solution to\r\nprevent a long “snuff” forming. Moreover, it was incorporated with the\r\ncandle itself to improve its appearance. The result was a constant\r\ndiffusion of arsenic vapour in the room. Tapers were also coloured with\r\nemerald green (copper aceto-arsenite), which likewise gave rise to\r\narsenical fumes. These objectionable practices have been fortunately\r\ngiven up, owing to the strong representations of scientific men.\r\n\r\n7. Wood is sometimes preserved by a solution of arsenic, and then\r\ntarred. This use would be practically free from danger, except to the\r\noperatives.\r\n\r\n8. An alkaline arsenite is used for washing sheep to destroy vermin.\r\nThe workmen sometimes suffer. (Lancet, 1857, p. 281.) Streams have\r\nbeen poisoned, the solution has been drunk in mistake (Ibid, 1856, p.\r\n447), and lastly, the sheep themselves have been killed (Taylor’s Med.\r\nJuris., i. 272). Carbolic acid would probably answer better.\r\n\r\n9. Cupric arsenite (Scheele’s green) and aceto-arsenite (Schweinfurth\r\nor emerald green) are used as pigments. In one case, where a baker’s\r\nshelves had been painted with this colour, emerald green was found\r\nadhering to the bottoms of the loaves (Med. Times and Gaz., 1854,\r\np. 326). Blancmange (_R._ v. _Franklin & Randall_, Northampton,\r\n1848[132]), ornaments on cakes (Lancet, 1849, Feb. 17th), sweets,\r\ndresses, and artificial flowers (Husemann, Jahresbericht, 1872, p.\r\n480), lamp-shades, insides of pasteboard cigar-holders, toys,[133]\r\nwrappings for chocolate, &c., wafers, water and oil colours, and wall\r\npapers have all been coloured with emerald green. Whenever such things\r\nhave been swallowed, _the green colour is seen in the vomit_. Boxes of\r\npaints should never be given to young children. Cakes of emerald green\r\nand of other poisonous colours have often been sucked or eaten with\r\nfatal result; they are the more tempting as they are generally made\r\nup with honey or glycerine. Bright green wall papers have gone out of\r\nfashion, still many of the dull colours have emerald green in their\r\ncomposition. Such papers certainly give off arsenical dust, even if\r\nthey do not evolve arseniuretted hydrogen or other arsenical gas, and\r\nthe symptoms they produce have been well authenticated. In a new house\r\nthe papers should always be tested. Messrs. Woollams, of Marylebone\r\nLane, were, I believe, the first to disuse arsenical pigments in\r\npaper-hangings.\r\n\r\nThese arsenites of copper give, with a little ammonia, a blue solution\r\n(due to the copper), in which a crystal of silver nitrate becomes\r\ncovered with a yellow coating of silver arsenite. The As can also be\r\neasily found by the other tests.\r\n\r\nDr. Raseden of Mersberg finds that arsenical papers cause rheumatic\r\npains, neuralgia, cough, lassitude, and emaciation (Lancet, 1849,\r\nApril 7th). They also cause skin eruptions. These effects disappear\r\nwhen the patients are removed. In Germany the use of these pigments\r\nis prohibited; it should be so in England. Unfortunately no other\r\npermanent green colour is so bright in tint.\r\n\r\nThe copper arsenites are insoluble in water, but soluble in acids,\r\nhence are dissolved by the gastric juice, and then absorbed.\r\n\r\n10. In medicine, arsenic is used for skin diseases, ague, and as a\r\ntonic; externally for cancer and lupus. _Liquor arsenicalis_ B.P.,\r\nFowler’s solution, or “ague drops,” is composed of arsenic 80 grains,\r\npotass, carbonate 80 grains, water 1 pint, flavoured with lavender. It\r\nis a solution of potassium arsenite. _Liquor arsenici hydrochloricus_\r\nis arsenic dissolved in hydrochloric acid, giving arsenic trichloride,\r\nof the same strength as liquor arsenicalis. Among unofficial\r\npreparations are “_Donovan’s Solution of Arsenic_,” containing\r\nmercuric and arsenious iodides; strength 0·69 grain _arsenicum_ per\r\nfluid ounce: “_Davidson’s Cancer Remedy_” equal parts of arsenic and\r\nhemlock (Dr. Paris): “_Cancer Paste_,” containing 8 per cent. of\r\narsenic, with cinnabar and dragon’s blood: “_Hydrophobia Pill_,” 1/16\r\nto 1/12 grain arsenic, with 1 grain pepper, an absurd remedy much\r\nused in the East Indies. (Blyth’s Pract. Chem., 1879, p. 376.) The\r\npharmacopœial preparations of arsenic acid will be described under\r\n_arsenic pentoxide_.\r\n\r\n11. It is given by grooms to horses, to render their coats sleek, and\r\nimprove their wind, under the name of “condition balls or powders”\r\n(strength 2½ to 5 per cent. of arsenic), also for worms, and as a tonic.\r\n\r\n12. For destroying the nerves of decayed teeth, about 1/25 grain\r\nis placed in the cavity. In the Lancet a case is recorded in which\r\ninflammation and caries of the jaw followed this practice, which is a\r\nvery dangerous one.\r\n\r\n13. In the manufacture of some aniline dyes, and in the reduction of\r\nindigo, arsenic is often used. Dyed stockings, &c., have caused skin\r\nirritation, supposed to be due to arsenic, but more probably owing to\r\nthe dye itself.\r\n\r\n14. Firework preparations commonly contain some compound of As, and\r\ntherefore give poisonous vapours. “Bengal light” consists of 24 of\r\npotass. nitrate, 7 of sulphur, and 2 of realgar (arsenic disulphide).\r\nSee also Blyth, Prac. Chem., p. 379.\r\n\r\n15. _Rat Poisons_:—No. 1. Arsenic 6 per cent., made into a paste,\r\nwith equal parts of flour and suet, variously coloured and scented.\r\nNo. 2. Equal parts of arsenic and carbonate of barium (itself\r\npoisonous), coloured with rose pink, and scented with oils of anise and\r\nrhodium.[134]\r\n\r\n_Fly Poisons._—“Fly powder,” a grey mixture of As and As_{2} O_{3}.\r\n“Fly water,” a solution of arsenious acid, or arsenite of soda or\r\npotash, of varying strength, sweetened with sugar, treacle, or honey.\r\n(Med. Times and Gazette, Sept. 13th, 1851.) Some also contain orpiment\r\n(arsenic trisulphide).\r\n\r\n16. For cleansing metals, arsenite of soda has been used on account\r\nof its strong alkalinity. It is an absurd preparation to use for this\r\npurpose, as washing soda or potash would act better. In December,\r\n1857, 340 children were poisoned by water from a boiler that had been\r\n“cleaned” by this compound (Taylor on Poisons, 2nd ed., p. 378). In\r\n1863, a man died from drinking beer out of a pot which had been thus\r\ncleansed (Taylor, Med. Juris., 1, 273).\r\n\r\n17. The well-known “arsenic eating” of Styria has been ridiculed as\r\nimpossible, but has yet been authenticated on further examination. A\r\nStyrian wood-cutter was seen by a medical man to eat a piece of arsenic\r\nweighing 4½ grains, and next day another 5½ grains, yet remaining in\r\nhis usual health. It is also eaten by the natives of Ceylon (Med. Times\r\nand Gaz. 1862, p. 454, and 1866, p. 375). Workmen in arsenic factories\r\noften become habituated to its influence. See a paper by Roscoe, Mem.\r\nof Lit. and Phil. Soc. of Manchester, 1860. I myself can testify to\r\nthis fact. A student in the College of Science, Dublin, was accustomed\r\nto take out of the arsenic bottle little lumps about 3 or 4 grains each\r\nand eat them, without apparent ill effect.\r\n\r\n18. As a cosmetic, applied externally, it would probably be useless.\r\nUnless the skin were abraded, or it remained very long in contact,\r\nno absorption, and hence no poisonous effect, would result, but any\r\nscratch or wound would be dangerous. (See Christison’s Evidence, case\r\nof Madeline Smith, p. 320.) And if in protracted contact with the skin,\r\nit will cause symptoms. (Memoirs of Lond. Med. Soc., ii., 397, Amer. J.\r\nof Med. Science, July, 1851.)\r\n\r\n19. A solution of chloride of arsenic has been employed for “bronzing”\r\nmetals. The fumes would be highly pernicious.\r\n\r\n20. Ritter, of Rouen, states that glucose or starch-sugar frequently\r\ncontains arsenic, derived from the sulphuric acid employed in its\r\nmanufacture being made from arsenical pyrites. He finds that by this\r\nmeans the arsenic is introduced into _beer_ brewed with glucose, into\r\nconfectionery, syrups, liqueurs, &c. (Reimann’s Färber Zeitung, No. 3,\r\n1878.)\r\n\r\n21. It is said that certain paper collars and cuffs which are\r\nextensively made in America have proved poisonous from containing a\r\nconsiderable proportion of arsenic. (Les Mondes, Nov. 11th, 1880.)[135]\r\n\r\n22. _Speculum Metal_, for telescope mirrors, is an alloy of copper,\r\ntin, and 3 per cent. of arsenic.\r\n\r\n23. In America, a paper soaked in a solution of arsenic and other drugs\r\nis burnt, and the smoke inhaled for asthma and bronchitis. (Year Book\r\nof Pharm., 1873, p. 345.)\r\n\r\n24. Traces occur in mineral waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHIDES OF ARSENIC.\r\n\r\n_Orpiment_, As_{2} S_{3}, Auripigmentum, or King’s Yellow, trisulphide\r\nof arsenic, obtained by precipitating a solution of arsenic with\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, is a yellow inodorous powder, insoluble in water\r\nand in hydrochloric acid, but slowly oxidizing in air to arsenious\r\nacid, and therefore poisonous. It is found native. By heat it melts\r\nto a reddish liquid: if air be excluded, it volatilizes at about 700°\r\nC., and condenses unchanged: if air be present, it is oxidized to\r\nsulphur dioxide and arsenic trioxide, which condenses in the crystals\r\nbefore-mentioned. It is soluble in alkalies and their carbonates,\r\nand reprecipitated by hydrochloric acid. Commercial “King’s Yellow,”\r\nformerly used as a pigment, but now replaced by Chromate of lead, is\r\na very poisonous mixture of As_{2} O_{3} and As_{2} S_{3}. It is\r\nsometimes employed in printing indigo. A mixture of orpiment, water and\r\nlime is used in the East as “Rasma” (see page 320) for a depilatory.\r\nIn a corpse, by putrefaction, the arsenic is frequently converted into\r\nsulphide.\r\n\r\n_Realgar_, the disulphide, As_{2} S_{2}, is red, exists as a mineral,\r\nand is also made artificially for fireworks. It contains _about_ 75 per\r\ncent. of arsenic, but varies. Formerly it was used as a pigment, and in\r\ntanning to remove hair.\r\n\r\nThese sulphides have rarely been used for criminal purposes. _Orpiment_\r\nwas employed by Mary Ann Burdock, 1833.[136] Being insoluble, they\r\nwould only be absorbed after oxidation into As_{2} O_{3}. Ossikovszky\r\n(J. Pract. Chem. 2, xxii., 323) finds that this change happens\r\nrapidly in contact with organic bodies. But the opposite change, by\r\nputrefaction and development of sulphuretted hydrogen, of As_{2} O_{3}\r\ninto As_{2} S_{3}, is far more likely and frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENIC ACID\r\n\r\nis obtained by oxidizing As_{2} O_{3} by nitric acid. It is a white\r\ndeliquescent solid, inodorous, _very soluble in water_ to a syrupy\r\nsolution, which is corrosive, strongly acid and metallic in taste. By\r\nheat it first gives the pentoxide, As_{2} O_{5}, then it breaks up into\r\nAs_{2} O_{3} and oxygen, finally completely volatilizing. It is said\r\nto be less poisonous than As_{2} O_{3}. (Wöhler and Frehrichs, Ann.\r\nChem. Pharm., lxv., 335.)\r\n\r\nThe _arsenates_ are very like the phosphates. Like them they give\r\nwith acid molybdate solution a yellow, with magnesium sulphate a\r\nwhite crystalline, precipitate. But with sulphuretted hydrogen, after\r\nacidifying, they give _slowly_ a yellow precipitate of sulphide\r\nof arsenic and sulphur; and with silver nitrate a _liver brown_\r\nprecipitate of silver arsenate.[137] Sulphurous acid reduces arsenic\r\nacid to arsenious.\r\n\r\n_Sodium arsenate_ is in the British Pharmacopœia, and is employed in\r\ncalico printing. A brominated solution of potassium arsenate (strength\r\n= 1 per cent. As_{2} O_{3}) is used in Russia for epilepsy. “Pearson’s\r\nsolution” is 1 grain sodium arsenate to 1 oz. water. “Macquir’s neutral\r\narsenical salt” is a binarsenate of soda. “Papier Moure” consists of\r\npaper soaked in solution of potassium arsenate (Tidy).\r\n\r\nFischer (Ber. deutsch. Chem. Gesellschaft, xiii., p. 1778) proposes\r\n_ferrous chloride_ as better than sulphurous acid for reducing arsenic\r\nacid to arsenious (see process for separation, post).\r\n\r\n_Arsenic Trichloride_, As Cl_{3}, is a volatile, colourless liquid,\r\nvery pungent, and fuming in air. It has been discarded from medical\r\nuse on account of its dangerous properties. A case of poisoning by it\r\nis mentioned in Taylor (Med. Juris. 1, p. 278). It is obtained in the\r\nprocess for separation from the organs. Arsenic Triiodide, a dull red\r\ncrystalline solid, is used in ointments.\r\n\r\n_Arseniuretted hydrogen_, As H_{3}, is a colourless gas of a garlic\r\nodour, almost insoluble in water. It burns with a livid bluish-grey\r\nflame, forming water and a white cloud of As_{2} O_{3}. By heating to\r\nredness it is decomposed into hydrogen and a deposit of arsenicum (the\r\n“mirror”). It is formed whenever hydrogen is evolved in contact with\r\narsenic compounds, hence has caused accidents in making hydrogen from\r\nimpure zinc. It is probably the most deadly compound of As, and proved\r\nfatal to its investigator, Gehlen, and in several other cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTION AND TESTS.\r\n\r\nIf arsenic has been given in the solid form, the greater part will\r\nremain insoluble, and will be found either in lumps or powder in the\r\nstomach, or as a white powder adhering to its lining. Any substance so\r\nfound should be washed with water and tested for arsenic. It is absurd\r\nto say, as Dr. Letheby did in Ann Merritt’s case (_ante_, p. 366), that\r\nthe quantity was too small for examination: if a white powder can be\r\n_seen_, it can be _tested_. In the contents, or in any fluid food, the\r\nheaviness of powdered arsenic will cause it to readily separate as a\r\nsediment. Soot or indigo, the legal admixtures, should also be sought.\r\n\r\nArsenic is not naturally present in the body (Sonnenschein,\r\nGerichtlich. Chemie, p. 122; and others). As it occurs in soils, in\r\ncases of disinterment a portion of the earth surrounding the coffin\r\nshould be tested.[138]\r\n\r\nWhen absorbed, it may pass into every part of the body, but more\r\nespecially into the liver and spleen. De Poncy and Livon have\r\nsupposed that it was capable of replacing phosphorus in the actual\r\nbrain substance (Comptes Rendus, 23, June 9th, 1879), and that it is\r\nmainly localized in the _brain_. Another author finds it concentrated\r\nin the _bones_. Prof. E. Ludwig of Vienna, in the case of a woman\r\nwho suffered from making artificial flowers coloured with magenta\r\ncontaining arsenic, found arsenic in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and\r\nstomach, but not in the bones or urine (Lond. Med. Record, Dec. 15th,\r\n1877, p. 509). He found also that in human beings as well as dogs\r\npoisoned with arsenic, in both acute and chronic cases, the liver\r\ncontained the largest amount, the kidneys sometimes a considerable\r\nquantity, and the bones, brain and urine, only small traces (Jahresb.\r\nfür Thierchemie, 1879, 85). These results have been discussed by\r\nJohnson and Chittenden (American Chem. Journal, 2, 332), who, in a\r\nwoman poisoned by arsenic, found, _a year and a half after burial_,\r\nover 5 grains of As_{2} O_{3}, almost evenly distributed. The\r\nconclusion to be drawn is, that, of the absorbed arsenic, the main\r\npart will be in the liver, and the rest in varying proportions in\r\nother tissues, so that as much as possible of the whole body should be\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nAs the large quantity of organic matter is in the way of the tests, it\r\nhas been proposed to get rid of this by different processes. That of\r\nFresenius and V. Babo consists in oxidizing the substances by strong\r\nhydrochloric acid and chlorate of potash. There is a great objection\r\nto this, as loss is liable to occur from volatilization of arsenic\r\ntrichloride, unless it is done in a retort, which is practically\r\nimpossible on account of the bulk and frothing, and the danger of\r\nexplosion from the oxides of chlorine formed.\r\n\r\nThe following modification of an old process has been found by the\r\nauthor to be satisfactory. It may be used also for antimony and\r\nmercury. Weigh the whole, cut up finely, and grind the matters to\r\na pulp with water, reserving a weighed portion of about one third;\r\nrender strongly alkaline with potash or soda previously tested\r\nfor arsenic. Pass in a current of chlorine, _stopping before the\r\nalkalinity is destroyed_. Boil the solution down to a low bulk, _not\r\nto dryness_, till a portion taken out and treated with acetic acid\r\ngives no chlorinous odour, showing that the hypochlorite has been\r\ncompletely decomposed. Arsenic trichloride does not escape from\r\nalkaline solutions, so there is no loss. Add sufficient _pure_ aqueous\r\nsulphurous acid, to reduce the arsenic acid to arsenious. Now transfer\r\nto a large retort provided with a tube-funnel and condenser, the\r\nend dipping into water in a well-cooled tubulated receiver, itself\r\nconnected by a tube with a flask containing dilute potash solution.\r\nThrough the tube-funnel pour in pure concent. sulphuric acid in volume\r\nabout equal to the liquid, adding it gradually, as there is much heat\r\nand effervescence. Mix well by shaking, and distil slowly from a sand\r\nbath. In distilling a moderately strong solution of mixed arsenious\r\nand antimonious chlorides in concent. hydrochloric acid, I have found\r\nthat the arsenic all comes over in the first third of the distillate,\r\nand that after two-thirds have passed over, the antimony also begins\r\nto distil. Hence, in the above process the distillation should not\r\nbe carried beyond half the volume of the liquid in the retort, when\r\nall the arsenic, _in whatever form it originally existed_, will be\r\nfound as chloride in the receiver, except a little which may have\r\nescaped into the potash. Test a portion of the potash solution by\r\nMarsh’s or Reinsch’s process as hereafter described: if any arsenic\r\nbe present, add the remainder to the liquid in the receiver, taking\r\ncare that excess of free acid is left. Pass into the distillate washed\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen in excess (or add a solution of the gas in\r\nwater), warm, cover, and allow to stand. (The excess of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen may afterwards be removed by warming and passing in carbonic\r\nacid gas.) If any arsenic be present, a yellow precipitate of arsenious\r\nsulphide, As_{2}S_{3}, will appear; if the precipitate be pale, it will\r\nconsist mainly of sulphur, formed by the action of the sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen on the sulphurous acid which is present. Some organic matters\r\nare also generally present. Collect the precipitate on a filter, wash\r\nwith sulphuretted hydrogen water, dissolve in a dilute solution of\r\nammonium carbonate, and again precipitate with hydrochloric acid. The\r\nprecipitated arsenious sulphide is now nearly pure: it may be collected\r\non a small filter, washed rapidly, again dissolved in ammonia, the\r\nsolution received in a porcelain dish, evaporated to a low bulk,\r\ntransferred to a weighed porcelain boat, and heated cautiously in\r\na current of carbon dioxide to a temperature not above 400° C.,\r\nsufficient, in fact, just to melt the arsenious sulphide. [Sulphur\r\nboils at 446° C., As_{2}S_{3} at 700° C.] Any remaining sulphur is thus\r\nremoved, and the arsenious sulphide may then be weighed. The weight\r\nmultiplied by 0·805 gives the amount of arsenic trioxide.\r\n\r\nA less preferable way is to collect the arsenious sulphide on a weighed\r\nfilter, to dry, and dissolve out any sulphur by carbon disulphide. Yet\r\nanother method is to oxidize by nitric acid, evaporate, precipitate\r\nthe arsenic acid by a mixture of ammonic chloride, magnesic sulphate,\r\nand strong ammonia —“magnesia mixture”) as ammonio-magnesic arsenate,\r\nand weigh, either as that salt, or, after ignition, as pyroarsenate\r\nof magnesia. The former, dried at 100° C., contains 39·57, the latter\r\n48·29 per cent. of As. Lastly, if the sulphide, oxidized by nitric\r\nacid, be alkalized with ammonia, and warmed to 70° or 80° C. with a\r\nsolution of ammonium molybdate in nitric acid, as used for the ordinary\r\ndetermination of phosphates (see Fresenius, Qual. Anal., p. 54), a\r\nyellow precipitate of _arsenomolybdate of ammonia_ appears, which can\r\nbe weighed: it contains 3·3 per cent. of As (Bull. Soc. Chem., Jan.\r\n7th, 1877).\r\n\r\nBut where such importance may hang on quantities, the use of weighed\r\nfilters for such small amounts is simply courting error. When the\r\nAs_{2}S_{3} has been weighed in the porcelain boat, calculate it\r\ninto As_{2}O_{3}, or into As (it contains 61 per per cent. of As),\r\nthen cover it with a mixture of pure potassic cyanide and sodium\r\ncarbonate, place it in a piece of combustion tubing drawn out at the\r\nend into a long thin point, pass washed dry carbon dioxide over it,\r\nand heat cautiously till all the water is expelled. Finally raise the\r\ntemperature to full redness, and pass a _slow_ continuous current\r\nof the gas, keeping the narrow part of the tube cool with moistened\r\nblotting paper. The sulphide will be reduced to As, which will deposit\r\nin a metallic coating on the narrow portion. Seal this part, and\r\npreserve it as evidence.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the residue in the retort may be tested for other\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nThe presence of arsenic ascertained, and the quantity known, it would\r\nseem as if nothing more was necessary. Still, it is useful to confirm\r\nresults by the other tests. The reserved portion may now be divided and\r\nused as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSH’S TEST.\r\n\r\nIf hydrogen be evolved in presence of arsenical compounds, it combines\r\nwith the element to form “arseniuretted hydrogen,” or _arsine_,\r\nAsH_{3}, a colourless gas of alliaceous odour, extremely poisonous,\r\ngiving, when passed into silver nitrate solution, a precipitate of\r\nsilver and a solution of As_{2}O_{3}; decomposed at a red heat into\r\nAs and hydrogen, and burning with a livid flame into As_{2}O_{3} and\r\nwater. The flame yields, when a cold surface, such as a porcelain\r\ncrucible-lid or dish, is depressed into it, a steel-grey lustrous stain\r\nor ring of metallic arsenic.\r\n\r\nTo evolve the hydrogen, Marsh originally used zinc and sulphuric acid.\r\nAs it is so difficult to obtain zinc pure, magnesium has been proposed.\r\nBut the evolution is then too rapid. Moreover, the reputed “pure”\r\nacids of commerce are scarcely ever free from a trace of arsenic. This\r\ndifficulty affects equally the galvanic method. Hence it is better to\r\nemploy _sodium amalgam_ (Edmund Davy, Chem. News, xxxiii., 58, and\r\nditto, 94). One part of sodium, scraped free from oxide, is melted\r\nunder solid paraffin, and gradually added to ten parts of mercury\r\n(previously purified by nitric acid) with constant stirring, the\r\nparaffin poured off, and the amalgam cleaned by washing with pure dry\r\nbenzine. The result is a solid crystalline alloy.\r\n\r\nA few fragments of this alloy are placed with water in a flask provided\r\nwith a thistle funnel, and with a delivery tube dipping into a 4 per\r\ncent. solution of silver nitrate. The horizontal part of the delivery\r\ntube is heated to just below redness by a lamp, meanwhile being\r\nsupported to prevent its bending. If, after about an hour, no As ring\r\nappears in the tube, and if the silver nitrate, after precipitation\r\nof the silver by hydrochloric acid and filtration, gives no arsenious\r\nsulphide on addition of sulphuretted hydrogen, the amalgam is pure.\r\nNow add to the flask the suspected liquid, put in more amalgam, and\r\ncontinue the heating of the tube and passing of the hydrogen till\r\nno further evolution of As occurs. The portion of tube containing\r\nthe deposit of As may be cut off, weighed, the As dissolved off\r\nby aqua regia, and the tube washed, dried, and weighed again. The\r\nsilver nitrate solution contains the remainder of the As dissolved\r\nas As_{2}O_{3}: after removal of the silver by hydrochloric acid and\r\nfiltration, the arsenious acid solution may be divided, a portion\r\ntitrated by iodine (see Blyth’s Pract. Chem., p. 392), and the rest\r\ntested qualitatively by sulphuretted hydrogen, ammonio-silver nitrate,\r\nand ammonio-cupric sulphate (see these tests, _post_).\r\n\r\nIf the original liquid be rendered strongly alkaline before adding\r\nthe amalgam, no antimony will pass off with the arsenic. But from\r\n_acid_ liquids, arsenic and antimony pass off together. They both give\r\nmetallic rings in the tube, and stains on a cold surface. The chief\r\ndistinctions between them are as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. _Arsenic._—More volatile, hence deposited further from the flame;\r\nbounded by a “hair brown” fringe of suboxide; heated in a current of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gives _yellow_ As_{2}S_{3}, unchanged by passing\r\ndry hydrochloric acid gas: heated in air, it gives easily a sublimate\r\nof As_{2}O_{3} in glistening octahedral crystals. It is soluble at once\r\nin chloride of lime solution.\r\n\r\n2. _Antimony._—Less volatile, hence forming close to the flame; no\r\nbrown fringe; heated in a current of sulphuretted hydrogen, gives\r\n_orange or black_ Sb_{2}S_{3}, volatilized by passing dry hydrochloric\r\nacid; heated in air, it gives a white oxide, volatile with great\r\ndifficulty, and not generally crystalline. It is insoluble in chloride\r\nof lime solution.\r\n\r\nBy the above process, Edmund Davy has detected one-millionth of a grain\r\nof As; 1/1000 grain gives a very decided effect in a few minutes. It\r\nis applicable not only to As_{2}O_{3}, but to all other arsenical\r\ncompounds in powder, whether soluble or insoluble. Organic matter\r\ninterferes very little.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that hydrogen alone may give a slight reduction and\r\nprecipitate in solutions of silver nitrate.\r\n\r\nTo prepare pure sulphuric acid and pure zinc, see Selmi, Chem. Soc.\r\nJournal, May, 1881, p. 311.\r\n\r\n\r\nREINSCH’S TEST.\r\n\r\nIf a fragment of pure copper be boiled with _pure_ hydrochloric acid\r\nfor ten minutes, no discolouration occurs. If now a solution containing\r\narsenic be added, the copper turns black or grey, from formation of an\r\nalloy of copper and arsenicum. On drying the copper, and heating it\r\nin a small glass tube closed at one end, the arsenicum is oxidized,\r\nwith production of crystals of As_{2} O_{3}. Organic matter does not\r\ninterfere. _Antimony_, sulphides, and some metals produce a similar\r\ngrey deposit, but do not yield a _crystalline_ sublimate. _Mercury_\r\nalso precipitates on the copper, but the sublimate consists of metallic\r\nglobules.\r\n\r\nAny compound of arsenicum, mixed with dried potassium cyanide and\r\ncarbonate of soda, introduced into a piece of hard glass tubing drawn\r\nto a point, and heated in a slow stream of dry carbon dioxide, gives\r\na deposit, in the narrow portion, of the whole of its arsenic in the\r\nmetallic form (Fresenius).\r\n\r\nAs_{2} O_{3} heated in a tube with dry potassium or sodium acetate\r\ngives _cacodyl-oxide_ (Bunsen) of an exceedingly offensive alliaceous\r\nodour.\r\n\r\nIn solution, arsenious acid gives:—\r\n\r\n1. _With ammonio-silver nitrate_ (prepared by adding silver nitrate to\r\ndilute ammonia till a precipitate just forms) a _yellow_ precipitate of\r\nsilver arsenite, soluble in ammonia and in nitric acid.\r\n\r\n2. _With ammonio-cupric sulphate_ (prepared by similarly treating\r\ncupric sulphate), a _bright green_ precipitate of cupric arsenite.\r\n\r\n3. With _sulphuretted hydrogen_ a yellow colour (the intensity of this\r\nhas been proposed as a method of estimating small quantities of arsenic\r\nby comparison _à la_ Nessler), but no precipitate till hydrochloric or\r\nother acid be added, when _yellow arsenious sulphide_ falls. This is a\r\nmost delicate test, as arsenious sulphide is only soluble to the extent\r\nof one part in one million of water (Fresenius, Quant. Anal. p. 137),\r\nand not much more soluble in acids. The precipitate may be weighed, or\r\ntreated as already mentioned (pp. 386-7). Tin and cadmium solutions\r\nalso give yellow sulphides, but they are insoluble in ammonia, and do\r\nnot yield the other tests.\r\n\r\n4. Stannous chloride (protochloride of tin) gives a brown deposit of\r\nmetallic arsenic. With acids containing traces of arsenic it gives a\r\nbrown colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOSES.\r\n\r\n1. _Medicinal_ (British Pharmacopœia).—Acidum arseniosum (As_{2}\r\nO_{3}), 1/60 to 1/12 grain in solution. Liquor arsenicalis (solution of\r\npotassium arsenite), 2 to 8 minims. Liquor arsenicalis hydrochloricus\r\n(solution of chloride of arsenic), 2 to 8 minims. Sodæ arsenias (sodium\r\narsenate), 1/16 to ⅛ grain. Liquor sodæ arseniatis (solution of the\r\npreceding), 5 to 10 minims. Ferri arsenias (ferric arsenate), 1/16 to ½\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\n2. _Poisonous._—Smallest recorded: _one grain_, (Lancet, Dec. 16th,\r\n1837), _two grains_, (Provincial Journal, 1848, p. 347); average\r\nsmallest, 2½ grains. Recoveries have been described after enormous\r\ndoses, up to 1½ ounce, taken solid and therefore not dissolved,\r\nrejected by vomiting or purging, or prevented from irritant action by\r\nabundance of food (see a case in the Lancet, Jan. 13th, 1849, when 1oz.\r\nwas taken with recovery).[139]\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasy may cause smaller doses to be dangerous; on the other\r\nhand, habit may cause tolerance of the poison, as already mentioned\r\nwith regard to arsenic eaters. Nitre is said to increase the poisonous\r\naction (Med. Times, 1844, p. 216). Antimony by its prostrating action\r\nwould have the same effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms usually commence in ½ to 1 hour after administration\r\n(Taylor), but vary with dose, form, &c. They have also been _immediate_\r\n(case of Lofthouse, York, 1835); in ten minutes (Guy and Ferrier); in ¼\r\nhour (Taylor); in 5, 7, 8, and 10 hours (Med. Gaz. xlvii. 722); in 23\r\nhours (Med. Times, Oct. 21, 1848); in _four days_ (Woodman and Tidy,\r\nForens. Med. p. 134).\r\n\r\nAs to the character of the symptoms, _irritation of the stomach and\r\nintestines_ is the main feature. Burning pain, vomiting and purging,\r\ncramps and occasionally tetanus (Orfila, i., 449) occur. Rarely there\r\nis insensibility and no pain. Great thirst, constriction of the throat,\r\nheadache, and finally exhaustion are common. Sometimes epilepsy\r\nor paralysis has been caused. The truth is, that every variety of\r\nconstitutional disturbance may be caused by the violent irritation of\r\nthe alimentary canal, except that the intellect is rarely affected.\r\nIn many cases the effects closely resemble those of acute diarrhœa or\r\nEnglish Cholera. One anomalous case is on record when death occurred in\r\nfour hours after sound sleep, and _no inflammation_ of the stomach was\r\nfound (Lancet, xii., 194). For a detailed list of cases, see Guy and\r\nFerrier’s Forens. Med. p. 457.\r\n\r\n_Fatal period._—Shortest, twenty minutes (Taylor); average, about\r\ntwenty-four hours. Death in three to eight hours is common. But the end\r\nhas been sometimes far more protracted, even to _two years_ (_Ibid._,\r\nMed. Jur. i., 256).\r\n\r\nThe _vomit_ is usually yellowish (L’Angelier) from bile: occasionally\r\nit is tinged with blood; rarely white. If the arsenic has been mixed\r\nwith soot or indigo, these will affect its colour.\r\n\r\n_Post Mortem Appearances._—The lining membrane of the stomach and\r\nintestines is almost always inflamed and reddened, rarely darker from\r\ncongestion. White patches, covered with mucus, should be examined\r\nfor solid arsenic. Perforation, ulceration, and gangrene are rare.\r\nIn bodies long buried, the arsenic is often converted into sulphide\r\nby putrefaction, and then appears as a yellow coating. Occasionally\r\ninflammatory appearances are found in the mouth, throat and other\r\norgans. Congestion of the brain is uncommon.\r\n\r\nAmong the effects of _chronic_ poisoning by arsenic may be noted\r\ninflammation of the eyelids (conjunctivitis), skin eruptions,\r\nirritability of the stomach, jaundice, and local paralysis (for cases\r\nsee Taylor’s Med. Jur., i. 252).\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT AND ANTIDOTES.\r\n\r\nVomiting should be encouraged by emetics or tickling the throat; the\r\nstomach pump being used if judicious. To obviate the irritation,\r\ndemulcents such as arrowroot, mucilage, &c., are useful. Albumen\r\n(white of egg) has proved serviceable (Lancet, Jan. 13th, 1849). To\r\nrender the arsenic insoluble, magnesia or chalk may be given. But the\r\nbest chemical antidote is hydrated ferric oxide, freshly prepared\r\nby precipitating ferric chloride or tinct. ferri sesquichlor. with\r\ncarbonate of soda (washing soda), or by similarly precipitating ferrous\r\nsulphate (copperas), and then shaking the mixture with air till it\r\nturns red, or by the following formula:—\r\n\r\n  Tinct. ferr. perchlor.     1 oz.\r\n  Sod. bicarb.               1 oz.\r\n  Tepid water, a teacupful.\r\n\r\n(Hoglan, Year Book of Pharm. 1881, p. 211).\r\n\r\nM. Lucas of Beauvais has stated, that in nine cases of arsenical\r\npoisoning, calcined magnesia arrested the symptoms and eventually\r\nremoved the effects (J. Chim. Medi. 1850).\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nArsenic has been given in pessaries by the vagina, in ointment for skin\r\ndiseases and by “cancer doctors,” also inhaled as vapour for asthma,\r\nin each case with dangerous result.\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of this poison in common articles of use gives\r\nan opportunity to the defence which has led to analyses of multitudes\r\nof articles—wall-papers, clothing, cooking vessels, &c. It may be\r\npositively affirmed that if white arsenic _in the solid state_ be found\r\nin the stomach, it could not have come from any of these sources. The\r\ntrace that could be derived from wall-papers would be infinitesimal.\r\nThe tests for arsenic are almost inconveniently delicate, so that\r\nthe slightest impurity of the reagents will make it appear to be\r\npresent. Reichardt (Archiv. der Pharm., xiv. 1-23), states that 1/1000\r\nmilligramme of As_{2}O_{3} evolved as arseniuretted hydrogen will\r\nprecipitate silver nitrate, and that by this means he has found it in\r\nthe urine of patients suffering from arsenical wall-papers. The effect\r\nof such papers is certainly pernicious, though it may be mentioned that\r\nin Silesia mortar is made with arsenical sand, and people living in\r\nhouses thus built do not suffer (Lancet, 1849, April 7th). On the whole\r\nit may be concluded that in a trial, _traces_ of arsenic will not be\r\nsufficient, a tangible quantity found and _weighed_ will be the only\r\nsufficient evidence of poisoning by the mouth.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the value of a knowledge of chemistry to a medical man in\r\nsuch cases the following may be quoted. A child of ten was supposed to\r\nhave eaten a quantity of meal mixed with arsenic for rats. An emetic of\r\nsulphate of zinc was given: the first vomit gave with ammon. sulphate\r\nof copper a bright green, with ammon. nitrate of silver, a yellow\r\nprecipitate, thus establishing that the poison was arsenic. Emetics and\r\ndiluents were continued, then albumen was given. Some hydrated ferric\r\noxide was hurriedly made from common green vitriol (ferrous sulphate)\r\nand ammonia: the washed precipitate was administered in successive\r\nteaspoonfuls. Recovery on the third day. In the vomit 10 grains of\r\nwhite arsenic were found. (Lancet, 1849, p. 311.)\r\n\r\nThe following is a curious form of attempted poisoning. A person lately\r\npresented this prescription in Paris: “Decoct. barley, 8 oz.; hydroch.\r\nacid, 1 drachm; _arsenious acid, 10 grains_.” The signature of a\r\nphysician was appended, but, on suspicion being aroused, was found to\r\nbe a forgery.\r\n\r\nIn Ann Merritt’s case, Dr. Letheby stated that arsenic had been taken\r\nnot more than two or three hours (afterwards he said four) before\r\ndeath, because he found undigested gruel in the stomach, containing\r\narsenic _in solution_, and because the intestines contained very little\r\narsenic. This conclusion was considered by weighty authorities to be\r\nrash, and probably wrong, because:—\r\n\r\n1. He found 2 grains (a poisonous dose) in the liver. This could hardly\r\nhave got there within so short a time.\r\n\r\n2. In a stomach irritated by arsenic or disease, food may remain\r\nundigested for seven, eight, or more hours.\r\n\r\n8. A previous dose of arsenic, adherent to the coats of the stomach,\r\nmight be dissolved by an influx of warm gruel.\r\n\r\n4. The portion in the intestines might have been evacuated by purging.\r\n\r\n5. The “pinkish liquid” described by the surgeon who performed\r\nthe _post-mortem_, pointed to admixture with blood, therefore to\r\ninflammation of some standing, and certainly did not tally with Dr.\r\nLetheby’s description of “gruel.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to the alleged administration of arsenic in cocoa in\r\nMadeline Smith’s case, the following details will be illustrative.\r\n\r\n100 grains of white arsenic were found to be a small teaspoonful,\r\nnot heaped. This quantity was mixed with two teaspoonfuls of Epps’s\r\ncocoa. The colour was rendered lighter, but still looked natural. On\r\nmaking up with boiling water and milk, as directed, a cup of cocoa\r\nwas obtained, in which neither appearance, taste, nor smell, betrayed\r\nanything unusual. On standing the milk rapidly curdled, and the arsenic\r\ndeposited, but this would not be seen in an opaque cup. With arrowroot\r\nor gruel a similar result was obtained.[140]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that arsenic trioxide volatilizes with the vapour of\r\nwater. I have not found this to be the case to any appreciable extent,\r\nbut it does volatilize slowly at 100° C., and still more at 120°. About\r\n½ gramme of As_{2} O_{3} lost, after six hours on the water-bath, 3 per\r\ncent. of its weight; after six hours at 120° C. it lost six per cent.\r\nWhen chlorides are present, as in the body, it is still more liable\r\nto volatilization as arsenic trichloride. Hence matters containing\r\nit cannot be boiled down or dried without danger of loss, unless\r\npreviously rendered alkaline.\r\n\r\nR. Otto has stated that ordinary sulphuretted hydrogen may contain\r\narsenic from the sulphate of iron used. He proposes to prepare the\r\ngas by the action of pure hydrochloric acid on pure calcium sulphide\r\nobtained by roasting gypsum with charcoal (Ber. Chem. Ges. xii. 250). I\r\nhave tested water into which sulphuretted hydrogen has been repeatedly\r\npassed, and have found no arsenic: if really present in the gas, the As\r\nH_{3} is not absorbed in the liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPOISONING BY ANTIMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE cases under this head are very numerous, and, therefore, difficult\r\nof selection. I have given, as the leading cases, full reports, (1),\r\nof that of Dr. Pritchard, of Glasgow, tried in the High Court of\r\nJusticiary, in July, 1865, for the poisoning of his wife by repeated\r\nsmall doses of antimony, and his mother-in-law by antimony and aconite;\r\n(2), of that of Dr. Smethurst (the Richmond poisoning case), tried for\r\nthe poisoning of his mistress by small doses of antimony and arsenic,\r\nat the Central Criminal Court, August 15th, 1859[141]; (3), I have\r\nadded a report of the Liverpool poisoning case—that of Thomas Waislow,\r\nfor the poisoning of Ann James, by antimony, tried at Liverpool, August\r\n20th, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF DR. PRITCHARD.[142]\r\n\r\n _Before_ THE LORD JUSTICE CLERK (RIGHT HON. JOHN INGLIS), LORD\r\n ARDMILLAN, _and_ LORD JERVISWOODE, _at the_ HIGH COURT OF JUSTICIARY,\r\n EDINBURGH, _July, 1865_.\r\n\r\n _For the Prosecution_: The Solicitor-General (_now_ Lord Young), Mr.\r\n Gifford, _and_ Mr. Chrichton.\r\n\r\n _For the Defence_: Mr. Rutherford Clark, Mr. Watson, _and_ Mr. Brand.\r\n\r\nBy the _first_ count of the indictment the prisoner was charged with\r\nthe murder of his mother-in-law, Mrs. Taylor, by administering to her,\r\nbetween the 10th and 25th of February, 1865, in Battley’s sedative\r\nsolution, tapioca, porter, or some other medicine or food, to the\r\nprosecutor, unknown, tartarised antimony, aconite, and opium, or one\r\nor more of them. In the _second_ count he was charged with the murder\r\nof his wife by administering the like poisons, or one or more of them,\r\nbetween the 22nd day of December, 1864, and the 25th of March, 1865,\r\nin egg flip, cheese, porter, beer, or wine, or some other articles of\r\nfood, to the prosecutor, unknown. To the relevancy of the indictment\r\nseveral objections were taken, but overruled, and the prisoner pleaded\r\n“Not Guilty.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\n_Edward William Pritchard_, a native of England, and member of the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons since 1846, before he came to Glasgow, had\r\nbeen a traveller in the Polar and Pacific Seas, and in the countries\r\nbordering the Mediterranean, and first set up in practice at Filey, in\r\nYorkshire, where he married the daughter of a Glasgow silk merchant,\r\nby whom he had a family. In consequence of this connection, about 1859\r\nhe removed to Glasgow, where, from his writings on several diseases,\r\nhe became favourably known as a person of superior attainments, and\r\ngradually obtained a fair practice. Whilst thus apparently in the\r\nenjoyment of popularity and success, he, in 1863, became the subject\r\nof much adverse report, from the suspicious circumstances attending a\r\nfire in his house, by which a maid servant was killed—the Insurance\r\nCompany refusing to pay his claim, and the doctor not taking legal\r\nsteps to enforce its recovery. The ugly rumours about this affair,\r\nhowever, gradually subsided, and his social and professional position\r\nwas retained, until the sudden death of his mother-in-law, whilst\r\nstaying in his house to nurse his sick wife, was quickly followed by\r\nthat of the wife herself. As the mother-in-law was 70 years of age,\r\nthe statement that she had died of apoplexy was at first accepted.\r\nWhen, however, the death of the wife so quickly followed, suspicion\r\nwas excited, inquiries were instituted by the police, and on the 21st\r\nof March, 1865, Dr. Pritchard was arrested on the charge of poisoning\r\nher. A _post-mortem_ examination of her remains had proved that her\r\ndeath had not been due to natural causes, and a subsequent examination\r\nof the body of his mother-in-law, exhumed for the purpose, led to the\r\nsame result in her case. Chemical analyzations of the interior portions\r\nof both bodies disclosed in that of the wife the presence of antimony\r\nin sufficient quantities to account for her death; and in that of the\r\nmother-in-law to reduce the powers of her constitution so far as to\r\nincrease and facilitate the effects of a narcotic poison.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nThe details of the progress of the lingering illness of Mrs. Pritchard\r\nuntil her death, and of the sudden seizure of Mrs. Taylor with what\r\nproved to be a fatal attack apparently of apoplexy, were given in great\r\nminuteness by several non-professional witnesses, servants in the house\r\nat the time, pupils of Dr. Pritchard’s, and a girl whom Dr. Pritchard\r\nhad seduced and promised to marry when his wife died.\r\n\r\nUp to October, 1864, Mrs. Pritchard, never apparently a very strong\r\nwoman, had been in her usual state of health. Towards the end of\r\nthat month, however, she began to look pale and lose her strength\r\nfrom frequent vomitings, and had to keep her bed, as she believed,\r\nfrom a severe cold, for four or five days. About this time, on her\r\ntemporary recovery, she went on a visit to her parents in Edinburgh,\r\nand there gradually recovered, returning home about Christmas in her\r\nformer state of health. After a week or so the vomiting returned, and\r\non the 1st of February, 1865, she had a severe attack of cramp. Some\r\nfew days after, as the prisoner said, Dr. Cowan, a relative, saw her,\r\nand prescribed small doses of champagne as a stimulant. However, the\r\nvomiting returned, and about midnight on the 8th she was seized with\r\nsuch a violent attack of cramp that, at her request, Dr. Gairdner was\r\ncalled in, who at once stopped all stimulants. Dr. Pritchard told\r\nevery one that his wife was suffering from gastric fever. Dr. Gairdner,\r\nhowever, could not find any feverish symptoms, and based his advice on\r\ntheir absence, confessing himself “puzzled with the case.” On the 10th\r\nMrs. Taylor, her mother, came from Edinburgh to nurse her daughter. She\r\nwas a hale, hearty woman, though 70 years of age, but at times affected\r\nwith severe headaches, as a remedy for which she had been accustomed\r\nfor some years to have recourse to Battley’s sedative solution. On the\r\n13th, at her suggestion, some tapioca was bought, brought into the\r\nhouse, and left for some time on the lobby table. Of this, afterwards,\r\na cupful was made, and fetched by Mary McLeod, the younger servant, and\r\nby her carried up to her mistress’s bedroom. Whether Mrs. Pritchard\r\npartook of this or not was not known, but Mrs. Taylor ate a portion of\r\nit, and the cook tasted it before it left the kitchen. Both Mrs. Taylor\r\nand the cook were violently sick after taking the tapioca, the old lady\r\nsaying that she feared she was suffering from the same complaint as\r\nher daughter. The tapioca had not been tampered with when purchased,\r\nbut when the remainder of it was analysed it was found to be charged\r\nwith nearly five grains of tartarised antimony. On the 16th the old\r\ncook left, and Mary Patterson came. She found her mistress suffering\r\nfrom continual vomits, and gradually getting weaker—as Mrs. Taylor\r\nsaid, “one day better, and two days worse.” For the next twelve days\r\nthis state continued, and then a dreadful scene occurred. Mrs. Taylor,\r\nwho, whilst at Dr. Pritchard’s, had sent for a bottle of Battley’s\r\nsolution, was violently sick in the evening of the 24th of February,\r\nand about nine on that night rang the bell violently, and was found by\r\nthe servant vainly endeavouring to vomit and asking for hot water to\r\nassist her. By the prisoner’s orders this was twice brought, and when\r\non the second occasion Mary Patterson entered the room Mrs. Taylor was\r\nsitting in her chair with her head down, apparently insensible, and\r\nwith her eyes closed. She was lifted into bed, and died in about three\r\nhours. Whilst dressing her corpse a bottle, about two-thirds full of\r\nBattley’s solution, was found in her pocket, and identified as that\r\nwhich she had last purchased. That this also was pure and free from\r\npoison when sold was clearly proved. When, however, it was analysed,\r\nit was found to be charged with antimony and aconite. Dr. Pritchard\r\ndeclared that she had died of apoplexy following on paralysis; but\r\nDr. Paterson, who had been called in at the last moment, distinctly\r\ndeclared that there were no such symptoms. An attempt was made by the\r\nprisoner to get Dr. Paterson to give the usual certificate of the cause\r\nof death, and on his indignant refusal, the prisoner himself filled\r\nup the form with the words, “Paralysis for twelve hours, followed by\r\napoplexy,” and the first victim was buried.[143]\r\n\r\nMrs. Pritchard still lingered. She had been sick on the day before\r\nher mother’s death, but not for two or three days afterwards. Then,\r\nhowever, the attacks returned, coming on, as before, within an hour\r\nor two after her meals, which were uniformly sent to her by her\r\nhusband—generally by the hands of McLeod. It was during the last three\r\nweeks of her miserable existence, that on one occasion he sent to her\r\nfrom the supper table a small bit of cheese, which McLeod tasted at\r\nMrs. Pritchard’s request, when it gave her a burning sensation in the\r\nthroat, and made her thirsty. At another time he sent her a jug of\r\ncamomile tea, after taking a wine-glass of which, from time to time, as\r\nordered, she uniformly vomited. At another time, he had some egg-flip\r\nprepared for her in the kitchen, and brought down the pieces of sugar\r\nfor it, taking them, as the witness believed, into his consulting\r\nroom, where he kept his drugs and poisons, before he put them into the\r\nglass. Patterson, who tasted it, was struck with the taste, and Mrs.\r\nPritchard, who drank it, was sick very soon after, and in the following\r\nnight. In the week in which Mrs. Pritchard died she drank some port\r\nwine which Dr. Pritchard had sent up, and again was sick. On the 17th\r\nof March, the day before she died, Patterson, who had gone up to her\r\nbedroom to speak about some linen, found Dr. Pritchard handing his wife\r\na glass of porter, which she drank. At that time Mrs. Pritchard was in\r\nher senses. About five o’clock the bell rang violently. McLeod called\r\nPatterson to come up at once. She did so, and found her mistress raving\r\nabout her mother, and calling on them to leave her and assist Mrs.\r\nTaylor; her hands severely cramped—speaking wildly about her children.\r\nAfter her hands had been rubbed, Mrs. Pritchard seemed to get more\r\ncalm, and Mary Patterson left, having handed the patient’s supper to\r\nher husband. Until about half-past one the next morning Patterson heard\r\nnothing. Then she was called up by McLeod to get a mustard poultice,\r\nwhich the latter took up to the bedroom, and in a few minutes after the\r\nbell again rang violently. She hurried up, and found the prisoner in\r\nbed by his wife’s side. Her mistress was dead. The long agony of months\r\nwas at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF THE MEDICAL ATTENDANTS.\r\n\r\n_Dr. James Moffat Cowan_, her second cousin, in consequence of a\r\nletter from the prisoner, saw Mrs. Pritchard on the 7th and 8th of\r\nFebruary. She was then in the drawing-room, and complained of great\r\nirritability of the stomach, combined with an inability to keep down\r\nher food, and vomiting for some time back. He visited her rather as\r\nan old friend than as a professional man, recommended her to go to\r\nbed, and advised small quantities of champagne with ice to be taken\r\nat intervals, and as she expressed a desire for food, recommended her\r\nhusband to try injections of beef tea. She was seized with vomiting\r\nduring the evening, but when he saw her before he left on the following\r\nday, seemed better, and he never saw her again alive. He spoke to the\r\napparent happiness in which she lived with her husband, and to the fact\r\nthat, after her death Dr. Pritchard, to enable the servants to take a\r\nlast look at their mistress, had the coffin opened. Mrs. Taylor, with\r\nwhom he was intimately acquainted, Dr. Cowan described as a person of\r\nvery temperate habits.\r\n\r\n_Dr. William Tennent Gairdner_, who was sent for during the night\r\nbetween the 8th and 9th of February, immediately after Dr. Cowan left,\r\nwas told by the prisoner that for some time his wife had suffered from\r\nsickness and spasms, and that Dr. Cowan had recommended stimulants, and\r\nthat she had had champagne and chloroform.\r\n\r\n “I found her,” said the witness, “in bed, lying on her back, with\r\n a considerably flushed face, and in a state of pretty considerable\r\n excitement. She told me of Dr. Cowan’s previous visit and of her\r\n wish that I should be sent for, and we had a good deal of general\r\n conversation about her symptoms. I found her to a certain extent\r\n exhausted, but by no means extremely so. She had a pretty good pulse.\r\n There was nothing in her symptoms to indicate immediate danger, and\r\n the most remarkable thing about her symptoms was the violent state of\r\n mental excitement she was in and the spasms of the hands. She held her\r\n hands outside the bedclothes above her head, and I saw that the wrists\r\n were turned in, and the thumbs somewhat inverted towards the wrists—a\r\n very peculiar state of the hand. I thought she was intoxicated from\r\n the combination of champagne and chloroform. When I turned to the fire\r\n to warm my hands before feeling her, she called me very unfeeling, and\r\n begged me not to leave her, using expressions for which I thought she\r\n was not responsible, from her temporary intoxication. I then examined\r\n her belly, and asked particularly if there was any chance of her being\r\n pregnant,—that being a frequent cause of vomitings,—and found there\r\n was none; and, after various inquiries, feeling her pulse and her\r\n skin, spoke strongly against the use of stimulants, which I ordered\r\n to be at once discontinued until I saw her again. Next day when I saw\r\n her, she assured me that she felt better and had had no return of\r\n the vomiting, but had still the remains of the spasms in her hands.\r\n I repeated my injunctions of no stimulants or medicine, and that her\r\n only food should be a plain boiled egg and bread and milk—that is,\r\n nothing that could produce sickness or sit heavy on her stomach. I\r\n told her that if her stomach had fair play it would digest the simple\r\n food I indicated. _I was very much puzzled as to what was the matter\r\n with her, and, had I been attending her as a general practitioner,\r\n should probably have seen her once or twice a day; but there was a\r\n doctor in the house, and my habit is to act as a consulting physician,\r\n and not as a general practitioner._ I had to leave town for a distant\r\n engagement, but before I left I wrote to Dr. Pritchard to inquire how\r\n his wife was, and received the reply that she was better. I wrote also\r\n to her brother, Mr. Michael Taylor, _as I was very much puzzled with\r\n the case_, and asked to be backed up by him in forbidding the use of\r\n stimulants. On my return Dr. Pritchard called, and left word that his\r\n wife was better, and that I need not call again. I do not think that\r\n there was any fever at all.”\r\n\r\nIn his _cross-examination_ Mr. Clark, in consequence of Dr. Pritchard\r\nhaving said to the witness that it was a case of catalepsy, elicited\r\nthat Dr. Pritchard was somewhat careless in his nomenclature of\r\ndisease—“that he spoke occasionally a little at random, and was not a\r\nmodel of wisdom, accuracy, and caution, in applying names to things;”\r\nand that, in writing to her brother—who had been a fellow-student with\r\nhim—“he had not indicated to him that there had been any foul play,\r\nbut nothing more than improper treatment.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. James Paterson_, who gave his evidence with an apparently strong\r\nfeeling against the prisoner, a man of very large experience, living\r\nwithin two hundred yards of Dr. Pritchard’s house, had been called in a\r\nlittle before eleven on the night of the 24th of February, to see the\r\nmother-in-law.\r\n\r\n “Dr. Pritchard,” said the witness, “met me in his hall, and conducted\r\n me to the bedroom, telling me that his mother-in-law, whilst in\r\n the act of writing a letter, had fallen off her chair on to the\r\n floor, and been conveyed upstairs about half an hour before I came.\r\n She and his wife, said the prisoner, had partaken of some bitter\r\n beer for supper, and soon after both became sick and vomited, and\r\n complained of its being more bitter than usual. From the quantity\r\n remaining in the bottle they could not have taken more than a third\r\n of a pint each.[144] I asked in regard to the previous state of his\r\n mother-in-law’s health, and particularly as to her social habits,\r\n when he led me distinctly to understand that she drank spirits\r\n occasionally. He also stated that his wife had been very poorly for\r\n some time with gastric fever, and that, some days previously, he had\r\n telegraphed for her mother to come and nurse her. On entering the\r\n bedroom I observed Mrs. Taylor lying on the edge of the bed nearest\r\n to me on her right side, with all her clothes on. She had all the\r\n appearance of a sudden seizure. Mrs. Pritchard, in her night-dress\r\n and nothing on her head, and her hair very much dishevelled, was in\r\n the same bed, but underneath the clothes, sitting up immediately\r\n beyond her mother. Mrs. Taylor was then alive, and she gave me the\r\n impression of a healthy-looking old lady, and previously in very\r\n good health—rather beyond the usual size, well-formed; a very\r\n superior-looking person, not having the slightest appearance of being\r\n addicted to the use of spirituous or intoxicating liquors. Her face\r\n was rather pale, but the expression was calm and placid. The eyelids\r\n partially closed, the lips rather pale and livid; the breathing slow\r\n and laborious; the skin cool, and covered with a clammy perspiration;\r\n the pulse almost imperceptible, and she seemed to me perfectly\r\n unconscious. On my opening up the eyelids, I found both pupils very\r\n much contracted. From these symptoms, and judging from her general\r\n appearance, my conviction was that she was under the influence of\r\n opium or of some other powerful narcotic, and I at once pronounced my\r\n opinion that she was dying.\r\n\r\n “I and Dr. Pritchard retired a little from the bedside, and went\r\n to the fireplace, and I then stated distinctly that she was dying.\r\n Pritchard said she had frequently had attacks of a similar kind\r\n before, but never one so severe. I said, nothing that we could do\r\n would have the slightest effect, but that, as a last resource, we\r\n might try mustard poultices to the soles of the feet, the calves of\r\n the legs, and the inside of the thighs, and as quickly as possible\r\n administer a strong turpentine enema. Pritchard at once proceeded to\r\n prepare the enema, and said he had a little before given her one,\r\n in which he had administered a glass of brandy. The old lady lay\r\n apparently comatose, or unconscious; but on being roused a little,\r\n and the head and shoulders slightly elevated, there was a degree of\r\n consciousness came on, and the pulse became perceptible at the wrist.\r\n She had not manifested consciousness before. I directed Pritchard’s\r\n attention to the pulse, and he then clapped the old lady on the\r\n shoulder and said, ‘You are getting better, darling.’ I looked at him\r\n and shook my head ominously, as much as to say, ‘Never in this world.’\r\n A slight fit of retching now came on, and she put up a small quantity\r\n of a frothy kind of mucus, immediately after which the ‘coma,’ or\r\n insensibility, returned—the breathing became more oppressed, more\r\n laboured, and the alvine evacuations were passed involuntarily, I\r\n then concluded that the case was hopeless, but Pritchard administered\r\n his enema. I then left the room, and went downstairs with Pritchard to\r\n his consulting room, and there repeated my opinion that she was in a\r\n state of narcotism. Pritchard then said that the old lady was in the\r\n habit of regularly using Battley’s Sedative Solution, and that she\r\n had a few days before purchased not less than a half-pound bottle of\r\n that medicine, and that he had no doubt, or it was very likely, that\r\n she might have taken a good swig of it. I know that medicine, but\r\n seldom use it. My impression was that she was not what is called an\r\n opium-eater, or one that used opium to any great extent. She presented\r\n no appearance of that.”\r\n\r\nAt this visit Dr. Paterson’s attention was forcibly attracted to the\r\nappearances presented by Mrs. Pritchard.\r\n\r\n “She seemed,” said the witness, “exceedingly weak and exhausted.\r\n Her features were sharp or thin, with a high hectic flush on her\r\n cheeks, and her voice was very weak and peculiar—in fact, very much\r\n resembling a person verging into the collapsed stage of cholera. The\r\n expression of her countenance conveyed to me the idea of a kind of\r\n silly or semi-imbecile person at the time. At first I was inclined\r\n to attribute her appearance to the recent severe attack of gastric\r\n fever, which I was told by the prisoner she had had, and her symptoms\r\n aggravated, of course, by the great consternation and grief not\r\n unnaturally caused by the sudden and alarming condition of her mother.\r\n At the same time I must say that I could not banish from my mind the\r\n idea, or rather conviction, that her symptoms betokened that she was\r\n under the depressing influence of antimony—that conviction came upon\r\n me while in her presence, and I could not get quit of it. I did not\r\n put a single question to her.”\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven Dr. Paterson went home, and about one the next\r\nmorning he was sent for again, but refused to go, as he was certain he\r\ncould do nothing, but sent word that he would do so if Dr. Pritchard\r\nthought he could be of any use. No answer came, and it was not until\r\nthe Saturday morning that he heard of Mrs. Taylor’s death, when her\r\nhusband called on him to ask him to certify the cause of death, and\r\nthe duration of her disease. This he refused, telling Mr. Taylor that\r\nthat document was not given to friends of the deceased, but only to\r\nthe Registrar. Soon after Dr. Paterson received from the Registrar\r\nthe usual form to fill up, which he returned at once in blank as it\r\ncame, with this note:—“Dear Sir,—I am surprised that I am called on\r\nto certify the cause of death in this case. I only saw the person for\r\na few minutes a very short period before her death. She seemed to be\r\nunder some narcotic; but Dr. Pritchard, who was present from the first\r\nmoment of the illness until death occurred, and which happened in his\r\nown house, may certify the cause. The death was certainly sudden,\r\nunexpected, and to me mysterious.” The words “the cause of death” he\r\nrendered emphatic by underlining them. That was the only communication\r\nwhich he made to anyone, beyond speaking about it in his own family.\r\nThe certificate was eventually given by Dr. Pritchard, assigning as the\r\ncause of death “paralysis for twelve hours as the primary cause, and\r\nthe secondary, apoplexy,” the duration of which had been one hour.[145]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March he met Pritchard accidentally, who asked him to\r\ncome and see his wife, which he did the next day.[146]\r\n\r\n “She was in bed, still very weak and prostrate, and in a weak voice\r\n expressed her satisfaction and her gratitude at my calling. Then,\r\n in a very earnest manner, she asked me if I really thought that her\r\n mother was dying when I saw her. I said most decidedly I did, and\r\n had told Pritchard so. She then clasped her hands, looked up, and\r\n feebly exclaimed, ‘Good God, is it possible!’ and burst into a flood\r\n of tears. I put some questions then as to her mother’s previous state\r\n of health, especially if she was habitually addicted to the use of\r\n Battley’s solution. She told me that her mother’s health, generally\r\n speaking, was good, but that she suffered occasionally from what she\r\n called neuralgic headaches, and for relief of these attacks she did\r\n take a little Battley’s solution; but she added that she could not be\r\n said to be in the habitual use of that medicine.\r\n\r\n “I then questioned her about herself. She told me that for a\r\n considerable time past she had suffered very much from sickness,\r\n retching, and vomiting, with severe pains in the stomach and\r\n throughout the bowels, accompanied with purgings, great heat and\r\n uneasiness about the throat and mouth, and a constant urgent thirst.\r\n I examined her tongue; it was very foul, and of a lightish brown\r\n colour. Her features were still very sharp and deeply flushed. Her\r\n pulse was weak, contracted, and very rapid. Her skin was moist, but\r\n defective in animal heat, and altogether she presented the appearance\r\n of great general prostration. Her eyes were watery, but clear and\r\n intelligent. I prescribed for her small quantities of brandy and\r\n champagne to recruit her strength, and small pieces of ice to relieve\r\n the thirst and irritability of her stomach. If she tired of these, she\r\n should have recourse to granulated citrate of magnesia as a cooling\r\n effervescent drink, and have a mustard poultice applied on the pit\r\n of the stomach—these were verbal directions. I also recommended, at\r\n short intervals, small quantities of easily digested nutritious food,\r\n such as beef tea, calves’ foot jelly, chicken soup, arrowroot, and so\r\n on. I then wrote a prescription for 12 grains of camomile, 24 of blue\r\n or gray powder, 12 of powdered ipecacuanha, and 6 grains of aromatic\r\n powder, to be carefully mixed and divided into six parts, one to be\r\n taken daily, to relieve the biliary disturbance and soothe the mucous\r\n lining of the alimentary canal. I gave her the prescription, and told\r\n her to show it to Pritchard when he came home.”\r\n\r\nFrom then until the day before her death the witness did not see\r\nMrs. Pritchard. On the 5th of March Dr. Pritchard had called on him,\r\nand reported that his wife was better for his advice, but still very\r\nweakly, and her stomach irritable, and had been strongly advised by Dr.\r\nPaterson to continue the treatment he had recommended.\r\n\r\n “On Friday evening,” continued the witness, “Dr. Pritchard called\r\n upon me personally and requested me to come and see his wife. I did\r\n so. She was in bed in a sitting posture, supported by pillows, and I\r\n was very much struck with her terribly altered appearance. She seemed\r\n quite conscious. I went up to her bedside and she caught my hand, and\r\n I could see a half-smile of recognition on her countenance. She very\r\n soon began to mutter something about her having been vomiting. Dr.\r\n Pritchard was standing beside me, and he volunteered to say that she\r\n had not been vomiting—that she was raving. She complained of great\r\n thirst, and Pritchard poured some water out of a _carafe_ into a\r\n tumbler and gave it her, and she drank it. I observed her countenance\r\n very much changed from what it had been when I saw her last. Her\r\n cheeks were hollow, sharp, pinched-looking, and still very much\r\n flushed. There was a peculiarly wild expression: the eyes were of a\r\n fiery red and sunk-looking. Her pulse was very weak and exceedingly\r\n rapid. Her tongue was a darkish brown colour, very foul; and she\r\n immediately began to grasp with her hand as if to catch some imaginary\r\n object on the bedclothes. She muttered something about the clock,\r\n but there was none in the room. I expressed my surprise at the great\r\n change and alarming appearances, and asked Pritchard how long she had\r\n been confined to bed since I saw her. He said only since morning, that\r\n yesterday and yesterday afternoon she was in the drawing room amusing\r\n herself with the children. I again expressed my surprise at her\r\n alarming condition. He said she had not slept for four or five nights,\r\n and I replied that we must endeavour to procure some refreshing sleep.\r\n We went downstairs, and I then prescribed 30 drops of solution of\r\n morphia, 30 drops of ipecacuanha wine, 10 drops of chlorodyne, and an\r\n ounce of cinnamon water, to be taken every four hours if the first\r\n dose did not give relief. Pritchard wrote the prescription at my\r\n dictation. I said it was unnecessary; it was simple, and he might mix\r\n it himself. I was anxious to save time, and give relief as soon as\r\n possible. He said he kept no medicines but chloroform and Battley’s\r\n solution; he did not keep a small stock for any emergency, which I\r\n thought strange.[147] I then left the house, and at one o’clock the\r\n next morning a message came that Mrs. Pritchard was dying, and in less\r\n than three minutes after another that she was dead. I never entered\r\n Dr. Pritchard’s house except on the occasions I have mentioned. I\r\n never told him that I thought his wife had taken too much wine, and I\r\n never recommended Dublin stout for her.”[148]\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of Dr. Paterson was confined to two points,\r\nthe grounds on which he held that Mrs. Taylor had not the appearance\r\nof having been in the habit of using opium, and his conduct in not\r\ndisclosing to some member of her family the impression he had formed\r\nthat Mrs. Pritchard was being slowly poisoned by antimony. “When a\r\nperson is in the habit of taking opium to a great extent,” he said,\r\n“you generally find that they are not very good in colour. They are\r\ngenerally thin in features and hollow about the eyes—in fact, not of\r\na healthy appearance. Mrs. Taylor being stout and healthy-looking, my\r\nimpression was that she was not an habitual consumer of opium, though\r\nshe might take it occasionally as medicine.” On the second point he\r\nstood on professional etiquette as a consulting physician, and not the\r\nregular medical attendant, insisting that he had no right to revisit\r\nhis patient unless sent for, and saying that he believed he should\r\nnever have been called in the second time had he not accidentally met\r\nDr. Pritchard in the street.\r\n\r\n “His first impression arose simply from seeing Mrs. Pritchard at the\r\n time of her mother’s fatal seizure, when he formed his diagnosis from\r\n the symptoms that were present, just as he was in the habit of forming\r\n his opinion of any patient he saw for the first time—judging from\r\n symptomatology, the science of the signs of disease. It was not his\r\n duty to interfere in the family without being invited, as there was\r\n another doctor in the house, and he did the best he could by apprising\r\n the registrar when refusing to sign the certificate of Mrs. Taylor’s\r\n death. Had he been called in consultation with another medical man,\r\n he should have felt it his duty to state his medical opinion; and\r\n had there been a _post-mortem_ examination of Mrs. Taylor’s body at\r\n the time, he believed that in all probability the drugging of Mrs.\r\n Pritchard with antimony would have gone no further, at least at that\r\n time.”\r\n\r\nWhen called in the second time on the 2nd of March, he said:—\r\n\r\n “I believed her to be suffering under poisoning by antimony,”\r\n\r\nand I prescribed accordingly. I saw her alone, but I did not give\r\nher any indication of what I thought her ailment. I did not mention\r\nantimony or poison in the slightest. I did not give her any idea\r\nthat she was labouring under any but a natural disease, because the\r\ntreatment which I prescribed for her, provided she got nothing else,\r\nwas in my mind quite sufficient to have very soon brought her round,\r\ntaking it for granted that my advice was carefully walked up to. I\r\ndid not mention to Dr. Pritchard that his wife was being poisoned by\r\nantimony. It would not have been a very safe matter to have done so.\r\nI did not go back the next day to see if my advice had been acted on.\r\nI did not consider that she was my patient at all. I had no right or\r\ntitle to go back and see her. In any case where a consultation is held,\r\nthe consulting physician has no right to go back to see the patient; it\r\nwould be a breach of the etiquette of the profession.”[149]\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_ Dr. Paterson stoutly adhered to his opinion that\r\nhis being called in to see Mrs. Pritchard was purely accidental, and\r\nthat it would not have been very natural to have communicated his\r\nsuspicions to the husband.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE AND POSSESSION OF MEDICINES AND POISONS BY THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner, when it was suggested by Dr. Paterson that he should mix\r\nin his own consulting-room the prescription, on the 17th of March, told\r\nthe doctor that he did not, like other medical men, keep in his house\r\na small stock of medicines for any emergency. It was, however, proved\r\nthat in the presses in his room were at least five-and-thirty bottles\r\nof medicinal preparations, and several papers and bottles of poisons;\r\nand that he had been a constant purchaser of poisons, and especially of\r\nFleming’s tincture of aconite and tartarised antimony, from September,\r\n1864, to as late as the 16th of March, 1865.[150] According to the\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution, the quantities of antimony and tincture\r\nof aconite bought by him were largely in excess of the amounts sold to\r\nother medical men, though not so according to the experience of two\r\ndruggists called by the prisoner. Anyhow, as will be seen by the list\r\nin the note, the purchases were larger than could have been required\r\nin any ordinary practice. Besides the phials and papers subsequently\r\nproved to contain poison, in one of the presses was a bottle labelled\r\nBattley’s solution, which was found to contain an appreciable quantity\r\nof antimony, to the extent of 1·5 of a grain per fluid ounce, and the\r\nremainder of the tapioca to be charged with 4·62 grains of antimony to\r\nthe pound. A phial containing 3·5 grains of tartarised antimony, and\r\nthree others containing tincture of conium, and six other phials with\r\nsmall portions of tincture of aconite, conium, and digitalis, were\r\nfound in the prisoner’s cupboard. In the chloroform, no metallic poison\r\nwas discovered; but in a small wooden box with a screw cover were 15·5\r\ngrains of tartarised antimony and arsenious acid (the common poison\r\nof arsenic), in nearly equal proportions; 35 grains of tartarised\r\nantimony in a pasteboard box, and about ten drops of aqueous solution\r\nof corrosive sublimate were found in a quart wine-bottle.[151]\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL AND CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF THE BODIES OF MRS. TAYLOR AND MRS.\r\nPRITCHARD.\r\n\r\nMRS. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th and 30th of March the exhumed body of Mrs. Taylor was\r\nmedically and chemically examined by _Dr. Maclagan_, the professor of\r\nmedical jurisprudence in the university of Edinburgh, and _Dr. Henry\r\nDuncan Littlejohn_, surgeon of the Edinburgh police. In accordance\r\nwith the admirable practice of the Scotch courts these experts gave\r\nin formal certificates “on soul and conscience,” which were read in\r\ncourt before any personal examination was allowed. The medical report,\r\nafter detailing the healthy condition in which the different portions\r\nof the body were found, concluded by stating that the examiners “had\r\nnot been able to discover in the body any morbid appearances capable of\r\naccounting for death, and that they were of opinion that the cause of\r\ndeath could not be determined without chemical analysis, and that for\r\nthat purpose they had secured the alimentary canal and its contents,\r\nthe heart and some of the blood, the liver, the kidneys, the bladder\r\nand uterus, and a portion of the brain,” which had been entrusted to\r\nDr. Maclagan, of whose report the substance is now given:—\r\n\r\n “_Contents of stomach_, amounting to five ounces, having been first\r\n tested for vegetable poisons, and then for meconic acid, without\r\n success, ‘the residues of the above process were tested for mineral\r\n poisons; and a preliminary trial, by Reinsch’s method, having revealed\r\n the presence of antimony, I subjected the whole to a process by which\r\n I was enabled to determine the amount of this metal (process then\r\n described). Assuming, for reasons afterwards to be given, that the\r\n antimony existed in the form of tartar emetic, the amount of this\r\n represented by the sulphuret which I obtained from the stomach was a\r\n little more than a quarter of a grain (0·279).\r\n\r\n “_Contents of intestines._—The whole contents were evaporated at a\r\n gentle heat on the water-bath, and a dry residue obtained, weighing\r\n 430 grains. Ten grains of this, by Reinsch’s process, yielded a\r\n characteristic deposit of antimony. To determine in what form this\r\n antimony existed, other ten grains were treated with distilled water,\r\n the solution filtered, and the fluid subjected to Reinsch’s process.\r\n A characteristic antimonial deposit was obtained, thus proving that\r\n this metal was present in a soluble form. There are only two soluble\r\n forms of antimony met with in commerce. One of these, the chloride,\r\n is a dark-coloured, acid, corrosive fluid, totally unsuited for\r\n internal administration. The other is what is known scientifically as\r\n ‘tartarised antimony,’ and popularly as ‘tartar emetic,’ a colourless\r\n substance possessed of comparatively little taste, and in daily use\r\n as a medicinal agent. I have no doubt it was in this form that the\r\n antimony had been taken, which I found in the alimentary canal of\r\n Mrs. Taylor. I endeavoured to determine the amount of antimony in\r\n the contents of the intestines, but the deposit was too small to\r\n enable me with confidence to make it the subject of a quantitative\r\n determination. No arsenic was found.\r\n\r\n “_The Blood._—From one ounce a characteristic antimonial deposit was\r\n obtained.\r\n\r\n “_The Liver._—By operating on 1000 grains of this, I obtained a\r\n quantity of sulphuret, indicating that the whole liver contained one\r\n grain and one-tenth (1·151) of tartar emetic. I also examined the\r\n other solid organs and tissues removed from Mrs. Taylor’s body, in\r\n each case following Reinsch’s method, and in each case obtaining on\r\n copper a characteristic antimonial deposit. I thus found that there\r\n was more or less of antimony present in the muscular substance of the\r\n heart, the spleen, the kidney, the coats of the stomach, and of the\r\n rectum, the uterus, and the brain.\r\n\r\n “_Lastly._ As Mrs. Taylor’s body had been exhumed, I thought it my\r\n duty to examine some of the earth in which it had been interred,\r\n though this was superfluous, from the fact of the soil being dry, and\r\n the coffin entire: it was not found to contain a trace of soluble\r\n antimony, and was therefore incapable of impregnating with this metal\r\n any body buried in it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. PRITCHARD.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of March a similar examination was made of the body of Mrs.\r\nPritchard three days after death by the same medical men, who reported\r\n“that it presented no appearances of recent morbid action beyond a\r\ncertain irritation of the alimentary canal, and nothing at all capable\r\nof accounting for death.” They had therefore secured for chemical\r\nanalysis those parts of the body which they deemed likely to disclose\r\nthe cause of death. As a portion of this analysis had been conducted\r\nduring the temporary absence of Dr. Maclagan in London by Dr. Gamgee\r\nand Dr. Littlejohn, previously to the report being read they were\r\ncalled to prove that Dr. Maclagan’s report of what they had done in his\r\nabsence was correct. The following was the substance of the report of\r\nthe chemical analysis:—\r\n\r\n “(1.) _Contents of stomach_ amounted to little more than ½ an ounce,\r\n and free from all odour of any poisonous drug. Not a trace of any\r\n vegetable poison or of antimony was found.\r\n\r\n “(2.) _Urine._—The presence of antimony having already been\r\n ascertained in a portion of this secretion, the remainder (7 ounces)\r\n was employed to determine the quantity. The process followed was\r\n that by which antimony is obtained in the form of the sulphuret,\r\n after destroying the organic matter by means of hydrochloric acid\r\n and potash. The quantity was readily weighed, and found to be rather\r\n more than one-tenth of a grain (0·1078). This corresponds to nearly\r\n one-fourth of a grain (0·121) of tartar emetic.\r\n\r\n “(3.) _The Bile._—A little more than ½ an ounce of this fluid was\r\n obtained from the gall-bladder. By Reinsch’s process 50 minims\r\n readily gave an antimonial deposit. The remainder (4 drachms) used to\r\n determine the amount, yielded sulphuret of antimony corresponding to\r\n more than one-tenth of a grain (0·121) of tartar emetic.\r\n\r\n “(4.) _The Blood._—1 ounce, by Reinsch’s process, readily gave\r\n evidence of the presence of antimony.\r\n\r\n “(5.) _The Liver._—The weight was 36 ounces, a portion of which,\r\n weighing less than 4 ounces (1460 grains), by Reinsch’s process, gave\r\n sufficient antimony to coat rather more than four square inches of\r\n copper foil. (This experiment was satisfactorily tested by another\r\n process described in the report.) As to quantity, 1,000 grains gave of\r\n sulphuret of antimony 0·1234 grains, corresponding to a quarter of a\r\n grain of tartar emetic, making the whole amount contained in the liver\r\n almost exactly 4 grains (3·93 grains).\r\n\r\n “I next examined the remainder of the solid organs removed from the\r\n body of Mrs. Pritchard, and found more or less antimony in the whole\r\n of them.\r\n\r\n “I also examined certain articles of clothing and bed-linen handed to\r\n me by the officer, and in the stains on four of them—the chemise, two\r\n sheets, and a toilet-cover, on which was a stain as of wine—I found\r\n antimony. From these experiments I have been led to the following\r\n conclusions:—\r\n\r\n “(1.) Mrs. Pritchard had taken a large quantity of antimony in the\r\n form of tartar emetic.\r\n\r\n “(2.) Having regard to the absence in her body of any morbid\r\n appearances sufficient to account for death, and to the presence in it\r\n of a substance known as capable of destroying life, her death must be\r\n ascribed to the action of antimony.\r\n\r\n “(3.) That it is most unlikely that this poison was taken in a single\r\n large dose. Had this been the case, I should have expected to have\r\n found some more decided evidence of irritant action in the mouth, the\r\n throat, or the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n “(4.) That from the extent to which the whole organs and fluids of the\r\n body were impregnated with it, it must have been taken in repeated\r\n doses, the aggregate of which must have amounted to a large quantity.\r\n\r\n “(5.) That from the large amount found in the liver, from its ready\r\n detection in the blood, and from its being found passing so copiously\r\n out of the body by the bile and the urine, it is probable that some of\r\n the poison had been taken at no greater interval than a period of a\r\n few days previous to death.\r\n\r\n “(6.) That I am inclined to believe that it had not been administered,\r\n at all events in any great quantity, within a few hours of her death.\r\n Had this been the case, I should have expected to have found at least\r\n some traces of it in the contents of the stomach, and more in those\r\n of the intestines; whereas none was found in the former, and the\r\n amount found in the latter seems to be amply accounted for by the bile\r\n impregnated with the poison discharged into them from the liver.\r\n\r\n “(7.) That the period over which the administration had extended\r\n cannot be determined by mere chemical investigation, but must be\r\n deduced from the history of the case, with which I am unacquainted.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Maclagan_ then stated what portions of the bodies he had handed to\r\nProfessor Penny for further analysis, and described the result of his\r\nexamination of the solid residue obtained from Mrs. Pritchard’s body by\r\nthe process adopted by Dr. Gamgee and Dr. Littlejohn.\r\n\r\n “I determined the presence of mercury, and found a considerable\r\n quantity of antimony remaining in it. I got a clear fluid by operating\r\n on that residue with chlorate of potash and hydrochloric acid; and\r\n then passing sulphuretted hydrogen, I got a precipitate of a dirty\r\n orange colour, which was collected, washed and boiled in strong\r\n hydrochloric acid. The yellow colour disappeared, and the precipitate\r\n became black. The hydrochloric solution was then mixed with water\r\n and tartaric acid, and it gave an orange precipitate which, when\r\n collected and weighed, amounted to 0.082, equal on the whole to 1.265\r\n of sulphuret of antimony—rather more than a grain and a quarter—in\r\n the whole of the solid residue. This was in addition to what had been\r\n found in the intestines after the precipitate had been obtained by\r\n Dr. Gamgee and Dr. Littlejohn. A grain and a quarter of sulphuret\r\n of antimony is equal to two and a half of tartar emetic; the amount\r\n of tartar emetic in the whole of the intestines would be about five\r\n grains and three-quarters (5.712).”\r\n\r\n_In cross-examination, Dr. Maclagan_ deposed to the discovery of\r\nabout the three hundredth part of a grain of mercury in the 50 grains\r\nof sulphuret; that in some cases he was not content with the mere\r\npresence of the deposit on the foil, but boiled the copper foil in\r\npotash—namely, with the contents of the intestines and with the\r\nliver—but otherwise was content with the coloured deposit.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Frederick Penny_ then gave in his reports on the portions of the\r\nbodies of Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Pritchard, given to him by Dr. Maclagan.\r\nThe following is the substance of the report in Mrs. Pritchard’s case:—\r\n\r\n “_Dried Contents of Intestines._—By the first process employed an\r\n abundant black precipitate was obtained, which by proper treatment\r\n was separated into sulphide of antimony and sulphide of mercury.\r\n The sulphide of antimony, which was obtained of a fine orange-red\r\n colour, was washed, dried, and weighed. Its weight corresponded to\r\n a quantity of metallic arsenic equal to 2.1 grains in one thousand\r\n parts of the dried contents of the stomach. The same sulphide was\r\n found to be readily soluble in sulphide of ammonium, and also in\r\n hydrochloric acid; and the acid solution, when poured into water, gave\r\n a white precipitate, and when boiled with copper ribbon deposited\r\n a violet-coloured coating on the surface of the copper. The coated\r\n copper, on being heated in a glass tube, gave no distinct crystalline\r\n sublimate. All these results are eminently characteristic of sulphide\r\n of antimony when thus treated.\r\n\r\n “The sulphide of mercury gave metallic mercury corresponding to 3\r\n grains in 1,000 grains of the dried contents of the intestines.\r\n The report then states how these tests were confirmed by further\r\n experiments on the solution by Reinsch’s test supplemented by that of\r\n Marsh.\r\n\r\n “_Stomach_, by the same methods, yielded antimony in appreciable\r\n proportions, equal to 0.5 of a grain in 1,000 parts, but no mercury;\r\n that it was afterwards treated for morphia and aconite, but not a\r\n trace of these substances was obtained.\r\n\r\n “_Liver_ found to contain antimony equal to one-tenth of a grain in\r\n 1,000 parts, but no mercury.\r\n\r\n “_Spleen_ yielded antimony in about the same proportion as the liver,\r\n and also contained mercury in well-marked quantity.\r\n\r\n “_Kidney_ about the same proportion as the liver, and a minute trace\r\n of mercury.\r\n\r\n “_Heart_ yielded antimony in a proportion rather larger than that\r\n found in the liver, and less mercury than in the spleen.\r\n\r\n “_Brain_ yielded antimony in less quantity than the liver, and no\r\n mercury.\r\n\r\n “_Blood_ yielded a small quantity of antimony, and a faint trace of\r\n mercury.\r\n\r\n “_Rectum_, antimony in less quantity than the liver, and no\r\n indications of mercury.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mrs. Taylor, _Dr. Penny_ reported:—\r\n\r\n “That all the articles submitted to him (liver, stomach, heart,\r\n kidney, rectum, blood, and dried contents of intestines), and\r\n subjected to analysis, contained antimony; (2), that the contents of\r\n the intestines contained the largest proportion of antimony (0.583\r\n parts in 1,000 parts); next, the liver and stomach (0.047 of a grain\r\n in 1,000 grains in each); then the blood, and, in less quantity,\r\n the heart, kidney, and rectum; (3), that part of the antimony in\r\n the contents of the intestines was in a form soluble in water; (4),\r\n that the kidney was the only article in which mercury was detected;\r\n (5), that neither the stomach, nor the contents of the intestines,\r\n contained aconite or morphia in quantity sufficient to be detected by\r\n known chemical processes; (6), that the articles subjected to analysis\r\n contained no other metallic poison than antimony and mercury as\r\n reported above.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Penny_ also handed in his reports of the examination of the\r\ncontents of the cupboards in Dr. Pritchard’s consulting room, the\r\nsubstance of which has already been given. In the first of these\r\nreports, that of the 17th of May, Dr. Penny had stated that he was at\r\npresent engaged in testing the bottle of Battley’s solution (in which\r\nhe had discovered antimony) for other substances, the result of which\r\ninquiry he now detailed:—\r\n\r\n “I looked for mercury and other metals. I searched for aconite, and\r\n also for conium. I found aconite. This is tested chiefly by the taste\r\n of the abstract obtained by evaporation, and by its physiological\r\n action upon small animals. A portion of the fluid was evaporated\r\n to dryness, and the extract thus obtained was very carefully\r\n tasted, or its effects upon the tongue and on the lips ascertained\r\n by applying them to it. The effects were a tingling and benumbing\r\n sensation—characteristic of aconite. To another portion of the\r\n extract, dissolved in water, ammonia was added, and a precipitate\r\n was separated and examined in the same way, after being dissolved\r\n in diluted hydrochloric acid. The benumbing and tingling sensation\r\n produced by that precipitate was very slight. But the ammoniacal\r\n liquid, after the separation of the precipitate, was treated with\r\n hydrochloric acid, and evaporated, and the sensation produced by this\r\n residue was very strong.\r\n\r\n “With a view to ascertain the character of aconite when mixed with\r\n Battley’s solution, I mixed known quantities of tincture of aconite\r\n with Battley’s solution, treating the mixtures in the same way. I took\r\n Fleming’s tincture and the results were precisely similar; but when\r\n the proportion of aconite was equal to 5 per cent., the sensation was\r\n by no means strong; but when it was in the proportion of 10 per cent.,\r\n it gave a sensation, though the same, much stronger than that of the\r\n liquid in the bottle. I draw the conclusion, therefore, that in this\r\n solution the proportion was between 5 and 10 per cent. I purchased\r\n genuine Battley’s solution at several establishments in Glasgow,\r\n including that of ‘Murdoch Brothers,’ and was satisfied that none of\r\n them contained either antimony or aconite.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Penny_ then detailed his experiments with pure and impure\r\nBattley’s solution on rabbits. Genuine Battley, when injected under\r\nthe skin, did not kill; 40 grain drops from the bottle found in Mrs.\r\nTaylor’s dress did.\r\n\r\n “I made in all about ten experiments with the genuine Battley’s mixed\r\n with Fleming’s aconite. I will tell you the result of two experiments.\r\n In one set I injected a mixture of Battley into three young rabbits,\r\n and in a third into full grown rabbits. In the first set with young\r\n rabbits I injected 10 grains of genuine Battley’s solution. In the\r\n second experiment with a young rabbit I injected 10 grains of this\r\n Battley’s (that found in the prisoner’s cupboard); in the third, I\r\n injected a mixture of 9 grains of genuine Battley, and 1 grain of\r\n Fleming’s tincture of aconite. In the cases of the old rabbits I\r\n proceeded in a similar way, only increasing the dose to 40 grains.\r\n The symptoms manifested by the rabbits, old and young, subjected to\r\n the action of genuine Battley, were simple in character and few in\r\n number, and were not materially altered by the variation of the dose.\r\n The animal soon assumed a prone position, resting on the belly and\r\n chest, and the head invariably resting on the ground. The forelegs\r\n were either sprawling or gathered under the body, the hind legs always\r\n extended sideways; the eyes remained open, and the pupils were natural\r\n and not contracted; the breathing was invariably gentle; no cries\r\n were uttered, and no convulsions or spasms of the body were apparent.\r\n There was a complete condition of inanity, and, with the exception\r\n of the open state of the eyes, the animal seemed to be in a state of\r\n profound sleep. There was no indication of spasmodic movement, and,\r\n when aroused and urged to motion, the movements were always performed\r\n in a crawling, tortoise-like manner. In this state the animal remained\r\n for several hours, and then gradually recovered.\r\n\r\n “The effects produced by the mixture of genuine Battley with aconite\r\n presented a striking contrast to those resulting from pure Battley.\r\n Very soon after the injection the animal became restless and uneasy,\r\n and then began to crouch, resting on its flank, with the hind legs\r\n extending laterally, and the head erect. It next assumed a sitting\r\n posture, in an attitude of watchful expectancy, and commenced to\r\n twitch its lips and move its jaws as if chewing. Suddenly it staggers,\r\n rolls over, and quickly regains its feet. Saliva begins to flow\r\n from the mouth, and soon after piteous and peculiar choking cries\r\n are emitted. Its head is retracted, and the breathing is painfully\r\n laborious. Convulsions now set in, followed by intervals in which the\r\n limbs are quite relaxed, and the animal lies helpless on its side.\r\n Frantic leaps are now frequently taken, accompanied by movements of\r\n a paralytic character. A state of utter prostration also occurs,\r\n variable in duration, and then a strong convulsion comes on, during\r\n which, or immediately after which, the animal expires, the limbs\r\n becoming instantly relaxed.\r\n\r\n “_The symptoms exhibited by the rabbits subjected to the Battley from\r\n the prisoner’s cupboard responded in every important respect with the\r\n effects produced by this mixture, and it was impossible to detect any\r\n essential difference in them._”\r\n\r\nThe Battley’s solution used by Dr. Penny was not purchased from\r\n“Murdoch Brothers,” but he had purchased and analysed some from that\r\nhouse, and it was exactly similar to that which he had used. He had\r\nalso been present when the same experiments as his were tried on\r\nrabbits by Dr. Maclagan, in the presence of Drs. Christison, Gamgee,\r\nand Littlejohn, with the same result as in his experiments. Dr. Penny\r\nwas then examined on Dr. Maclagan’s report of his _post-mortem_\r\nexamination of Mrs. Pritchard’s body, and on the symptoms exhibited by\r\nher from the time she was taken ill in 1865 down to her death. Replying\r\npurely as a chemist, and not as a medical man, he declared them to\r\ncorrespond with the action of tartar emetic or tartarised antimony. He\r\nfurther accounted for the presence of the small portions of mercury by\r\nthe administration of Dr. Paterson’s powders, _Hydrargyrum cum creta_,\r\nshortly before death. In Mrs. Taylor’s case he considered the vomitings\r\nto be the result of the antimony, which had been traced by the\r\nanalyses, and repeated the conclusions, already given, to his reports\r\non both bodies.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Maclagan_, who was recalled, declared that the whole of the\r\nsymptoms in Mrs. Pritchard’s case, from Christmas, 1864, until her\r\ndeath—the sickness and vomiting, muscular depression, irritation\r\nof the bowels, and cramp in the stomach—were symptoms of poisoning\r\nby antimony, and could not, as a medical man, suggest any natural\r\ndisease to which they were due, that he could assign as the cause of\r\ndeath. He had never seen antimony when rubbed into the skin (referring\r\nto the prisoner’s statement that he had done so for a swollen gland\r\nin his wife’s neck) produce any constitutional effect. The fact of\r\nMrs. Pritchard some years ago having taken antimony internally for\r\ninflammation of the eyelids would not account for the symptoms; and\r\nhe agreed with Dr. Penny that the traces of mercury were due to the\r\npowders prescribed by Dr. Paterson. “There was nothing in the case,” he\r\nadded, “to indicate to a medical man of ordinary intelligence that she\r\nwas suffering from gastric fever, or any other fever”; and he adhered\r\nto the conclusions already given in his report, that she had been\r\npoisoned by minute doses of antimony in the form of tartar emetic given\r\nat intervals over a long period of time.\r\n\r\nDr. Maclagan attributed Mrs. Taylor’s death to something more than\r\nantimony—some powerful, depressing poison.\r\n\r\n “The symptoms,” he said, “might be produced by aconite—being found\r\n with her head fallen on her neck, and hardly observed to breathe, her\r\n pulse almost if not absolutely imperceptible, and the dozing, torpid\r\n state in which she lay, were such as would result from aconite. Though\r\n he might know in a case that aconite had been taken, he might not\r\n be able to find it by chemical analysis: these organic poisons—all\r\n the alkaloids—are very often not found, though known to have been\r\n taken. The administration of opium might diminish the effect of\r\n antimony in causing vomiting and purging, but its depressing effect\r\n on the muscular system would still remain; and if opium, aconite,\r\n and antimony were being administered at the same time, he should\r\n anticipate symptoms such as appeared in Mrs. Taylor’s case. Taking the\r\n symptoms and the results of the _post-mortem_ examination together,\r\n the idea of apoplexy was satisfactorily excluded from his judgment;\r\n and assuming the correctness of Dr. Paterson’s description of the\r\n symptoms he saw, he should not have concluded that it was apoplexy,\r\n nor did he think any other medical man would have. He was satisfied\r\n with the presence of aconite in the Battley’s solution, without the\r\n experiments on the rabbits, which only confirmed it.”\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of this witness was directed to the question\r\nwhether the symptoms in Mrs. Taylor’s case did not indicate poisoning\r\nby opium, probably arising from an overdose of Battley’s solution.\r\n\r\n “I saw,” said the witness, “no precise indications of poisoning by\r\n opium, though I cannot say that she had not taken some. I think\r\n aconite was the leading feature in the final part of the case. The\r\n symptoms described by Dr. Paterson did not, in my mind, indicate\r\n poisoning by opium or laudanum at all. They were not inconsistent with\r\n her having taken opium, but they were not consistent with her having\r\n been poisoned by it, and with the ordinary symptoms. The symptoms\r\n of aconite predominated. If she had taken opium alone I should have\r\n expected to find the pulse full and slow, and probably the breathing\r\n laborious and stertorous. Though these were absent, I could not say\r\n that she had not taken opium, particularly if she had been accustomed\r\n to its use.” _When reminded from the judge’s notes that Dr. Paterson\r\n had described the breathing as “laborious,” he said_, “It does not\r\n make much, indeed not any, modification of my view, because the\r\n condition of the pulse showed the action of aconite on the heart.\r\n Laborious breathing is an indication of many things besides opium.”\r\n _When reminded that Dr. Paterson spoke of her being in a state of\r\n “coma_,” he admitted that that generally indicated opium and not\r\n aconite, but added that here “it was more oppression than true coma,”\r\n and assumed that Dr. Paterson did not use the word scientifically, but\r\n as many persons did to describe insensibility. “_But,” said Mr. Clark,\r\n “you pointed to the absence of ‘coma’ as indicative of poisoning by\r\n aconite._” “I spoke of her,” replied Dr. Maclagan, “being in a torpid\r\n condition, which I think was connected with the weakened state of the\r\n circulation and not from fulness of the brain. Opium, like aconite,\r\n is a vegetable poison, and is absorbed into the system: a person may\r\n be poisoned by it without any trace remaining in the stomach or the\r\n system capable of being detected by chemical analysis. All mineral\r\n poisons are more easily detected, but I am not prepared to give into\r\n the statement broadly that a person cannot be poisoned by antimony\r\n without it being capable of detection, though I cannot recollect such\r\n a case. The quantity here found in both cases was considerable. The\r\n expectation is that the chemical analysis will detect it, but there\r\n may be exceptions. The fact that Mrs. Taylor’s eyes were contracted is\r\n an indication of poisoning by opium, but it also occurs in aconite,\r\n though the cases vary a good deal in that respect, from people, as\r\n I think, having observed the symptoms at different stages; and the\r\n probability is that contraction had been produced at first, and then\r\n relaxation at the time all the muscular parts became relaxed—namely,\r\n at the time of death. Aconite is applied externally in neuralgia.”[152]\r\n\r\n_Dr. Littlejohn_, who was next called, concurred in the opinion that\r\nthere was nothing to indicate gastric fever in Mrs. Pritchard’s case,\r\nand that her death was due to the continuous administration of small\r\ndoses of antimony from the commencement of her illness to the day of\r\nher death, and that the result of the chemical analysis was such as\r\nhe should, on that supposition, have expected. On the cause of Mrs.\r\nTaylor’s death he was not so certain.\r\n\r\n “It seemed to me,” said the witness, “that she might have died from a\r\n dose of antimony administered shortly before death, or else from some\r\n sedative narcotic poison. I have no difficulty in saying that she died\r\n of poison, but only as to the particular poison which killed her. I\r\n am inclined to believe that the symptoms in her case were mixed to\r\n some extent, like the symptoms of narcotic poison, and to some extent\r\n like the symptoms of antimony. There was nothing to show that she died\r\n of apoplexy, and the _post-mortem_ examination did not indicate any\r\n such. In the failure of circulation and great depression and spasms,\r\n and the state of insensibility, I recognise the action of antimony;\r\n in the later stages of antimonial poisoning we have generally great\r\n insensibility. The hot taste in the mouth and burning sensation in\r\n the throat after taking the bit of cheese suggest a large dose of\r\n antimony, and also suggest a strong dose of narcotic poison—they\r\n suggest many things besides cheese. That it caused violent sickness\r\n in the case of one of the servants for some hours is quite consistent\r\n with antimonial poisoning. In large quantities it would produce a\r\n burning sensation in the throat. I have tried it in large quantities,\r\n and the secondary sensation is always in the throat, and it did\r\n produce a burning sensation. That the egg flip gave the same effect\r\n in the case of the servant points to the use of antimony or some\r\n substance resembling it. Various other emetics might produce these\r\n effects. Egg flip is a convenient medium for administering antimony,\r\n as it readily dissolves in it, and sufficient antimony could be dusted\r\n on loaf sugar to produce sickness. Sugar is very porous, and antimony,\r\n being a white powder, could be dusted over it, and a large quantity\r\n absorbed in it—sufficient, not to kill, but to keep up the illness.”\r\n\r\nIn cross-examination, the witness adhered to his opinion as to the\r\nsuitableness of egg flip when the hot water had been poured on it, as\r\na medium for antimony, and to the possibility of a sufficient quantity\r\nto produce sickness being conveyed into the cup on two pieces of loaf\r\nsugar. Though he had not made any special experiments to support this\r\nopinion, he considered himself, from his special acquaintance with\r\ntartar emetic, entitled to answer in the way he had done. He did not\r\nconsider opium as a sedative but as a narcotic, and, in his opinion,\r\naconite was a sedative narcotic. There was nothing impossible for Mrs.\r\nTaylor to take opium, and for that to contribute to the symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Paterson_, who was re-called, was quite confirmed in his previous\r\nopinion of the cause of Mrs. Pritchard’s death from the evidence he\r\nhad heard. Mrs. Taylor’s death, he thought, had been caused by opium,\r\nbut there might have been some other narcotic combined to him unknown,\r\nand he thought that aconite and opium combined would contribute to\r\nthe effect and hurry the termination; but he never in his practice\r\nhad seen any person poisoned by such a combination. He had not the\r\nslightest suspicion of antimony, and the narcotic effect was such when\r\nhe saw Mrs. Taylor that he did not believe that he could recognise the\r\neffect of antimony. The narcotic effect would overpower the other, and\r\nlaudanum would interfere with the usual effect of antimony. What he\r\ncalled stertorous breathing was rather oppressed breathing—snoring\r\nand stertorous breathing were the same thing. “By coma,” he added, “I\r\nmeant insensibility—it means that, especially insensibility under\r\nopium; and my impression was that it was opium alone, or some of its\r\npreparations: it might be morphia.” Now that he had heard of the\r\ndiscovery of antimony in the body, he believed the death to be due to a\r\ncombination of antimony and opium, a smaller dose of the latter being\r\nlikely to have a greater effect, in consequence of the condition of the\r\nbody produced by the former. If the opium contained upwards of five per\r\ncent. of aconite, the effect, he considered, would be much more rapid\r\nand more likely to be fatal.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the medical testimony witnesses were called to\r\nprove that at two banks in Glasgow, where Dr. Pritchard had accounts,\r\nthese were overdrawn on the 20th of March—that he borrowed to the\r\nextent of £255 on his life policy, the last advance being as late\r\nas the 13th of May—that his mother-in-law had advanced him £500\r\ntowards the purchase of his house, and that under her will he would\r\nbe entitled, in the event of the previous death of his wife, to the\r\ninterest on two-thirds of her property for the benefit of his children\r\nuntil they attained twenty-one years, and then “for his own use as he\r\nmight consider proper.” Letters of Mrs. Taylor and Dr. Pritchard were\r\nidentified, in one of the latter being an entry under February 7th,\r\n“Dr. J. M. C. here; on February 8th Dr. J. M. C. left”—namely, Dr.\r\nCowan.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER’S STATEMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Scotch practice, two declarations were made by\r\nDr. Pritchard before the sheriff, one on the 22nd of March, and the\r\nother on the 21st of April. The _first declaration_ was as follows:—\r\n\r\n “I have always attended my wife in all her ailments of every kind\r\n during the whole period of our married lives, now fifteen years, and\r\n some of these illnesses were very severe; but I never saw her so ill\r\n as she was on the occasion which terminated fatally. As far as my\r\n judgment goes, her last illness was gastric fever, which commenced\r\n about the beginning of the present year. I gave my wife no medicines\r\n during her illness excepting wine, champagne, and brandy, to support\r\n her strength; and I gave her no medicines at all. I trusted to nature\r\n to right itself, with the assistance of these restoratives. During the\r\n last six weeks her power of sleeping entirely went away. In order to\r\n procure sleep I gave her, at the commencement of her sleeplessness,\r\n a small quantity of chloroform, but it entirely disagreed with her,\r\n and I discontinued it. I then called in Dr. Gairdner, professor of\r\n medicine in the university, and he visited and saw her several times;\r\n and he continued to attend her till her old medical friend, Dr. James\r\n M. Cowan, returned, and he came from Edinburgh to see her.[153] I then\r\n wrote to her mother to come and nurse her, and she arrived about the\r\n 11th of February last; and her arrival had a beneficial effect upon\r\n Mrs. Pritchard for some time, but still the sleeplessness continued;\r\n and shortly after her mother’s death, which happened on the 25th of\r\n February, she relapsed and became much worse, and very apprehensive\r\n about herself, and she suggested to me the adoption of a medicine\r\n with which her mother was very familiar—Battley’s solution of\r\n opium—but I declined to give her any without first consulting Dr. J.\r\n Paterson, who lived close by. I saw him, and consulted him, but he\r\n did not see Mrs. Pritchard on that occasion, and he did not approve\r\n of using the solution of opium. He prescribed granulated citrate of\r\n magnesia, calomel, mercury, and chalk, and I acted on his advice\r\n and administered the medicine, and it seemed to have a beneficial\r\n effect.[154] Some time after, finding her sleeplessness still\r\n continued, I, at her own suggestion, applied a solution of atropine\r\n to the external parts of the eye, and it had a little effect for some\r\n time, but the effects soon ceased. After her mother’s death, she\r\n became rapidly worse; indeed, I ascribed her decease to the agitation\r\n consequent on her mother’s death. At the time of the last event she\r\n was strongly impressed with the idea that she would herself die at\r\n the same time as her mother; in fact, she did die on a subsequent day\r\n at exactly the same hour. On the night preceding her death she was\r\n apprehensive that, unless she got sleep, she should not get through\r\n the night. I went for Dr. Paterson, who came immediately and sat\r\n for a considerable time by the bedside, and afterwards dictated a\r\n prescription, which was made up at the Glasgow Apothecary Company’s\r\n shop at Elmbank-street. It will be found in my desk at home. It was\r\n for two draughts to be given four hours after the first if it did\r\n not succeed. She got the first draught as prescribed by Dr. Paterson\r\n about ten o’clock, but she said after drinking it that it was not\r\n half strong enough, and asked if she might have some of her mother’s\r\n medicine. I refused to give it her, and said I dare not do it. I gave\r\n her a glass of port wine, and sat carefully watching for a short time.\r\n I then went down stairs and had supper, and, after being absent for\r\n some time, returned to see if she had got to sleep. I found her awake,\r\n and she wished me to give her something to make her sleep. I refused,\r\n and she then asked me to come to bed, as I must be tired with the\r\n weary nights of watching. It was then about twelve o’clock. I tried\r\n to persuade her that I should sit up to watch her till past the time\r\n when her mother had died; but to please her I got into bed, and almost\r\n immediately I fell asleep from the state of exhaustion I was in; was\r\n awoke by her pulling at my beard, and found my wife struggling to get\r\n into bed. She appeared to have got out of bed. She said, ‘Edward, I\r\n am faint.’ I assisted her into bed, and asked her how long I had been\r\n asleep, but she answered, ‘Don’t speak; look! do you see my mother?’\r\n I said ‘No, it is only a vision; only imagination,’ and asked if she\r\n felt pain. She said she felt cold, and I need try no more skill; that\r\n I had failed this time, and that she was going to her mother. I got\r\n alarmed and rang the bell violently, and the youngest servant came. I\r\n desired her to make a mustard plaster as quickly as she could, and on\r\n that my wife turned round and said, ‘Edward, I’m in my senses; mustard\r\n plasters will do no good,’ and almost immediately she fell back in my\r\n arms and died. The servant came with the mustard plaster, and found\r\n her in that position. I did not give her any other medicine at that\r\n time except a little brandy applied to her lips.[155] During the whole\r\n course of her illness I never gave her any antimony, nor any medicine\r\n in which there was any preparation of antimony. Antimony is a poison,\r\n but it is used occasionally to subdue inflammations, and I applied it\r\n to her neck, in October last, when she was plagued with a swelling\r\n gland in the neck. I rubbed it in externally on that occasion,\r\n and I have never given her any antimony since. On that occasion I\r\n recommended change of air, and I gave her a little bottle of antimony\r\n with her for the same purpose of rubbing in behind the ear. She went\r\n to Edinburgh at that time, and she returned to Glasgow very much\r\n better, and I have never seen the bottle of antimony since she got\r\n it away with her. There was a considerable quantity of antimony in\r\n my repositories at the time of my wife’s last illness, as I used it\r\n extensively in my practice, and it was kept in a cupboard of which I\r\n had the key, but which was not always locked. I did not see any of\r\n it brought out, or lying about, during her illness. The cupboard\r\n where the antimony was is in the consulting-room on the ground flat,\r\n and she was so weak on the day of her death—Saturday—and on the\r\n Friday preceding, that I do not think she had strength to have gone\r\n to the cupboard herself. My wife took the antimony internally on one\r\n occasion when she had a tendency to inflammation of the eyelids. This\r\n was years ago, and I never knew her to use it internally, except on\r\n this occasion. I never administered antimony to her internally on any\r\n occasion, nor any other substance calculated to injure or destroy\r\n life.”\r\n\r\nIn the _second declaration_, made on the 21st day of April, 1865,\r\nhe confirmed the correctness of the former one when read to him,\r\ndenied the charges as laid in the indictment, and elected to make the\r\nfollowing voluntary statement with reference to Mrs. Taylor’s death:—\r\n\r\n “I never administered poison to her. I did, and I do believe, that\r\n she died from paralysis and apoplexy. I have no further statements to\r\n make, and by the advice of my agent will make none, with the exception\r\n that I am entirely innocent of the charge preferred against me.”\r\n\r\nBeing asked by the Procurator Fiscal whether he ever administered or\r\ncaused to be administered to the said Jane Cowan or Taylor tartarised\r\nantimony, declares:—\r\n\r\n “My agent recommended me to say nothing, and I decline to answer the\r\n question, and, as I act under my agent’s advice, it is unnecessary to\r\n put any further questions.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nWith this evidence the prosecution was closed late on the third day,\r\nand on the next the defence was opened by calling witnesses on the\r\nPrisoner’s behalf.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Michael Taylor_, Mrs. Pritchard’s brother, had seen her on the\r\n28th of February, a few days after his mother’s death, when she\r\nobjected to Dr. Gairdner again visiting her, and to following her\r\nbrother’s advice to have a nurse, as she did not like strangers about\r\nher. He also identified as her writing two letters from Edinburgh to\r\nher husband at the time of her visit to her parents in November, in\r\nwhich she spoke of the slowness of her recovery and her inability to go\r\nout, except two or three times.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Simpson_, a partner in Duncan & Co., Chemists, in Edinburgh,\r\nremembered Dr. Pritchard, some four years ago, purchasing Battley’s\r\nsolution at their shop, and that shortly afterwards other purchases of\r\nthis compound were frequently made in his name by one Thomson, whom\r\nhe recognised, down to the beginning of 1865. _Fairgrieve_, another\r\nchemist in Edinburgh, spoke to repeated purchases of this compound by\r\nor for Mrs. Taylor for several years before her death, once in a 5-oz.\r\nbottle, but generally in bottles of 2 oz.[156]\r\n\r\nTwo other witnesses proved that they consulted Dr. Pritchard for\r\naffections of the ear, and that to the first he gave a bottle labelled\r\n“poison—2 drops in each ear every night,” and to the other a tonic\r\nof glycerine and strychnia; the object being to account for the\r\nnumerous poisons found in the cupboard in his consulting room.[157]\r\n_Dr. McHattie_ proved that there were not the necessary drugs in\r\nthe cupboard to enable the Prisoner to make up Dr. Paterson’s\r\nprescription,[158] and afterwards his eldest son certified that his\r\nfather and mother lived happily together, and his daughter, who lived\r\nchiefly with her grandparents, that they were fond of each other. The\r\nevidence for the defence then was closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLICITOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH.\r\n\r\nIn addressing the jury on the evidence, the counsel for the prosecution\r\ndrew their especial attention to (1) the fact—not contested and not\r\ncontestable—that though none of the medicines prescribed by the\r\nmedical attendants on both of the ladies had contained any preparation\r\nof antimony, antimony was found in their bodies—in that of Mrs.\r\nPritchard in such proportions as could only be accounted for by a long\r\ncontinuous administration of that drug—in Mrs. Taylor’s sufficient\r\nto so reduce her system as to increase the operation of any narcotic\r\npoison; (2) that the notion of this having been taken by accident was\r\nexcluded even by the prisoner’s own statement, and that the idea of\r\nsuicide was entirely at variance with the characters of the sufferers,\r\nand in the case of the wife with the fact that suicides do not choose\r\n“a long, lingering, and painful death;” (3) that the prisoner had\r\nin his possession the means of administering poison as well as the\r\nopportunities; (4) that in the three cases in which symptoms of\r\nantimonial poisoning were felt by those who tasted the cheese, the egg\r\nflip, and the tapioca, the prisoner had the opportunities of dealing\r\nwith these articles of food before they were sent to his wife; (5)\r\nthat in the remnant of one of them—the tapioca—antimony to a large\r\nextent was found; (6) that in a bottle of Battley’s solution found in\r\nthe pocket of Mrs. Taylor after her death aconite in deadly proportions\r\nwas detected; and (7) that there was a pecuniary motive, paltry as it\r\nmight be represented to be, to induce the prisoner to commit both these\r\nmurders.[159] Who, then, he said, put the antimony into the food? who\r\nput that and the aconite into the Battley’s solution?\r\n\r\n “Who, then,” continued the _Solicitor-General_, “was the murderer?\r\n For there was a murder—a deliberate, cold-blooded, cruel\r\n murder—committed in that house. Who was it? We know the inmates.\r\n There were the two students of medicine. I suppose you may lay them\r\n aside as having nothing to do with it. Suspicion does not attach\r\n to them, neither had they the opportunity. The servants change in\r\n the course of the enacting of this dreadful tragedy—all but one.\r\n Catherine Lattimer was there until the 13th of February. The poisoning\r\n went on after she left—the deaths both occurred after she left. She\r\n was not the poisoner, nor was there a breath of suspicion about her.\r\n Mary Patterson comes on the 16th of February. The poisoning, indeed,\r\n goes on after she comes; but it had commenced long before—weeks\r\n before. We, therefore, lay her aside. There was Mary McLeod, a girl\r\n under seventeen, the only remaining grown person in the house during\r\n the whole course of the administration to which I need refer. I need\r\n not take any notice of the children, who were the only other inmates\r\n of the house. See, then, to what we have come. There was a murderer in\r\n the house—a murderer practising the dreadful art of slow poisoning\r\n from the end of December till past the middle of March. The only two\r\n grown persons, except the boarders, who were in the house during\r\n that time—the only two who had access to the patients—were the\r\n prisoner at the bar and Mary McLeod. This is narrowing the case to a\r\n very short question. I have excluded every other idea from the case,\r\n by fair, legitimate, convincing argument, upon evidence that is not\r\n open to dispute. I have excluded the notion of natural death. I have\r\n established the fact of death by poison. I have excluded the idea of\r\n death by accident, by suicide, by the administration medicinally. You\r\n are shut up, therefore, to murderous administration.... I find that\r\n the only two who had access to these miserable victims, and had any\r\n opportunity to perpetrate the murders with which they are charged,\r\n were the prisoner and this one girl. Now, pray, consider, with\r\n respect to the wife, upon the question whether or no the prisoner is\r\n not the man clearly proved by irresistible evidence to be so, what\r\n was the nature of the murder? _It was a murder in which you almost\r\n detect a doctor’s finger._ It is gradual poisoning—poisoning so as\r\n not to kill but to weaken; leaving off for a day, and then resuming\r\n again—one day better, two days worse. During the whole time the\r\n patient exhibited the symptoms of vomiting and purging, the result of\r\n the action of antimony. You have that going on for a long time under\r\n the very eye of a medical man, the husband of the victim, who was in\r\n close attendance upon her. Do you think anybody else—do you think a\r\n girl of seventeen could have done that deed? She knew nothing about\r\n antimony.[160] If she did not do it, the prisoner must have done it.\r\n And what is his case? His case respecting his own wife, who was thus\r\n demonstrably being poisoned by inches under his very eye during this\r\n long period—what is his case? “I thought it was gastric fever,” he\r\n says. Gastric fever! Nobody could have thought it was gastric fever.\r\n Nothing like gastric fever in it. Nothing like anything except what\r\n it was—slow, cruel poisoning, which brought, in the course of two or\r\n three months, this poor woman to the grave, with such an amount of\r\n poison in her body.”\r\n\r\nReferring, then, to the false statements made by the prisoner in\r\nthe case of Mrs. Taylor—that she had tumbled off her chair in his\r\nconsulting room in a fit, and been carried up to bed, when it was\r\nproved that she had walked up to her bedroom from his consulting\r\nroom—had during the evening called to one of the servants to go\r\nout and get sausages for supper—had had no tumble or fit, and that\r\nthe doctor himself knew nothing about her attack till the bell rang\r\nviolently three times—that hot water had been taken up by the servant\r\nto make her vomit—the strange statement to Dr. Paterson before the\r\nbottle of “Battley” was found in Mrs. Taylor’s pocket, that she had\r\npurchased half-a-pound of it a few days before—the false certificate\r\nof her death, “paralysis for twelve hours and apoplexy for one hour,”\r\nwhen there was no paralysis except the paralytic affection caused by\r\nthe aconite, and that was not before she went upstairs at nine o’clock\r\nin the evening, only four hours before her death: then referring to the\r\ntapioca purchased entirely for Mrs. Taylor’s use, into which antimony\r\nwas put by some one; the Solicitor-General said:—\r\n\r\n “Keep in view that the method of poisoning alleged against the\r\n prisoner here is not the giving a dose that would kill, but the\r\n introducing it into the food in such quantities that the taking\r\n would not kill, but produce sickness merely—the intention being to\r\n produce and continue the sickness for months, the fatal termination\r\n then supervening. A poisoner in this way practises the dreadful art\r\n successfully, and could not be very apprehensive of even himself or\r\n any one else taking the food accidentally, as it would only make\r\n them sick. He knows that to produce death it will be necessary\r\n to continue it for a long time. Into this tapioca antimony is\r\n introduced—sufficient to produce sickness in anybody taking it,\r\n but not death. But Mrs. Pritchard does not get this tapioca. It is\r\n taken by Mrs. Taylor, and she is seized immediately by symptoms\r\n of poisoning by antimony. She is sick in the same way—I think she\r\n expressed it—as her daughter was; because the effects were the same.\r\n That tapioca was not put away, as it might be required again; and if\r\n Mrs. Pritchard had wanted tapioca again, she would have got that, and\r\n the poisoning would have been carried on by its means. If anybody else\r\n got it, it would be a misfortune, but not much more. And who could\r\n have introduced it but the master of the house, who was an adept in\r\n such a mode of poisoning.—I do not know how many, if more than one,\r\n partook of poisoned food; but some food had been poisoned. I take\r\n that for granted, and that it had been taken by one of the boarders,\r\n Connell, I think. But that is not presented as part of the case. He\r\n was one day more or less sick. The prisoner does not seem to have been\r\n alarmed about it—he does not seem to have been alarmed even when he\r\n himself was sick upon some occasion in February. He knew very well\r\n there was no occasion for alarm, for sickness was the end of it; that\r\n it would require a long sickness in order to produce anything like a\r\n fatal result.”\r\n\r\nBriefly, then, reviewing the points he had made, the Solicitor-General\r\nconcluded his exhaustive address.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Rutherford Clark_, in the opening of his speech, urged on the jury\r\nthat the enormity of the double crime required it “to be proved by\r\nevidence strong, clear, overwhelming, that brought home to their minds\r\nand consciences, without the slightest suspicion on the testimony, the\r\nguilt of the prisoner,” and that “the motives assigned for it were\r\nnot such as could ever have, in the slightest degree, actuated any\r\nhuman being to the commission of such hideous offences.” Whilst he\r\ncould not deny that he had the opportunity of committing the crime, he\r\ncontended “that it went a very short way—indeed no way at all—in even\r\nsuggesting or indicating his guilt.”\r\n\r\n “If,” he said, “you find a case where crime is committed, and where\r\n the person charged with committing it has made an opportunity\r\n for himself—has been zealous in obtaining opportunities—then\r\n opportunity is of the greatest possible importance and the strongest\r\n possible evidence; but to say that he has opportunity in this case\r\n is nothing more than to say it was likely, as indeed it was true,\r\n that the husband who was attending the sick bed of his wife, should\r\n carry to her some of her meals, and send up others with her meals.\r\n But that he should do so is, I am sure, nothing unnatural—nothing to\r\n suggest guilt. It would have been frightfully suggestive of guilt,\r\n if, instead of sending up these meals, and taking them up himself, he\r\n had always chosen some other agent to carry them up and to administer\r\n the food she was taking. If that had been the case, I should have\r\n been inclined to say that the Crown would have had a case much more\r\n strong to indicate guilt, than they have when, as it is stated here,\r\n that he was administering to the comfort of his wife while upon her\r\n death-bed.”[161]\r\n\r\nOn the point that the prisoner was in possession of the means of\r\npoisoning, “he was,” he said, “by profession a doctor, and had, no\r\ndoubt, as most doctors have, considerable quantities of drugs in his\r\npossession. Whether he had more than most medical men kept in their\r\nhouses was a matter of opinion, but it was absurd to suppose that he\r\naccumulated these large quantities of most powerful and destructive\r\npoisons—a minute dose of many of which would have been fatal—for the\r\npurpose of murder.”[162]\r\n\r\n “But,” continued _Mr. Clark_, “it is not unimportant, in considering\r\n this question, and it is very important especially in considering\r\n the argument of the Solicitor-General, that these poisons were kept,\r\n not in any locked press, but, on the contrary, within the reach of\r\n the household. It is a remark I have made, that there was not one of\r\n the poisoned articles of food which ever reached the lips of Mrs.\r\n Taylor or Mrs. Pritchard without passing through other hands than the\r\n prisoner’s, and it is odd enough that, in regard to each of them, the\r\n person who administered it and who carried away the food left, is\r\n this girl, Mary McLeod. It will not do for the Solicitor-General to\r\n say, ‘I have established that one of two persons must have committed\r\n these crimes,’ and that you can trace the particular finger of the\r\n medical man in connection with them. Probability will never support\r\n a conviction. It will not do for him to say, as regards the death of\r\n Mrs. Pritchard, that it was the act either of the prisoner or Mary\r\n McLeod, and that it was not likely that a girl of under seventeen\r\n would have the skill to do it. Do you not think that he shrinks from\r\n the onus of proof when he accepts this convenient mode of getting rid\r\n of the difficulty, as he must prove that it is one of those two who\r\n did it. He must prove by evidence that it was not Mary McLeod or some\r\n one else in the house, and it was only by showing that it was not\r\n Mary McLeod, that he can bring this charge home, to the prisoner.”\r\n [Mr. Clark then noticed that the question was put to Lattimer whether\r\n she put anything into the tapioca, but that that question was not put\r\n to Mary McLeod.] “It is a singular omission in the case of the Crown,\r\n which necessarily depends upon being able to select between those\r\n two persons, whom the Solicitor-General stated were the only two who\r\n could have committed the murder, that they did not venture to put the\r\n question to exclude upon her evidence the fact that she might have\r\n been guilty. And this is all the more strong that I shall trace every\r\n article of poisoned food immediately through her hands.”[163]\r\n\r\nSubsequently he reviewed the evidence as to each of the three poisoned\r\narticles of food.\r\n\r\n “Let us see,” he said, “about this tapioca:—it was suggested,\r\n apparently through Mrs. Taylor, that Mrs. Pritchard would like\r\n some. Accordingly some tapioca is brought by a little boy, and it\r\n is brought in, and received by Mary McLeod. She says she placed it\r\n for some short time on the lobby table. Catherine Lattimer says Mary\r\n McLeod took it down to her, but Mary says Mrs. Taylor did. Now the\r\n suggestion of the Crown is that the prisoner put antimony in this\r\n tapioca, so nicely adjusted to the quantity bought as to produce\r\n sickness leading to death, but not so as to produce death itself. It\r\n would certainly have been of some importance to have shown that he had\r\n any opportunity of administering or putting any poison into it, but\r\n it is not proved—there is not a shadow of evidence that he had any\r\n opportunity, or to show that he was in the house at the time. He was\r\n a man accustomed to exercise an active profession, and, of course,\r\n would naturally be out at that period of the day; but at all events it\r\n is not shown that he was aware that his wife desired tapioca, or that\r\n his mother-in-law had ordered it. It is not even shown that there was\r\n the least possibility of his introducing antimony into that bag. It is\r\n prepared and carried up by Mary McLeod to her mistress, who declines\r\n to take it, and it is taken by Mrs. Taylor, who was taken ill after\r\n partaking of it.”\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the poisoned bit of cheese:—\r\n\r\n “It is spoken to by Mary McLeod. She tells you she had taken up the\r\n tray for supper, and that on it was the cheese and other things which\r\n were placed on the table at which Dr. Taylor and the other inmates\r\n of the house are sitting; that she came out, and that, on returning\r\n again, Dr. Pritchard handed to her a piece of cheese to take to her\r\n mistress. She did not see him cut off the piece of cheese, but he\r\n handed it to her sitting at the table; and it is perfectly obvious it\r\n must have been cut off the cheese eaten by the family at supper. If\r\n he placed antimony upon it, it must have been in the presence of the\r\n persons at supper—a piece of yellow cheese which must have indicated\r\n the powder of tartarised antimony, if placed upon it.[164]—It was\r\n not asked if it were possible to put this tartarised antimony upon\r\n the cheese while sitting at supper. I leave you to judge if it were\r\n possible. It was taken up oddly enough—I cannot help noticing the\r\n coincidence—by Mary McLeod. She says she ate part of it, and that it\r\n did her no harm; but the residue was taken down into the kitchen and\r\n eaten by Patterson, and she suffered from vomiting.”\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the poisoned egg-flip:—\r\n\r\n “The doctor comes and tells his servant to prepare some, a thing not\r\n unnatural to be taken by a person with a delicate stomach, and for a\r\n medical man to order. But it is said this was a plot for Dr. Pritchard\r\n to get in his drugs in this way. He supposes that he went through the\r\n dining-room and got the sugar, and then into the consulting-room, and\r\n then into the pantry, and dropped the pieces of sugar, on which he had\r\n put antimony, into the egg. Does he give any proof of this? Does he\r\n suggest anything more than suspicion? The Crown seems to have doubted\r\n whether he could on the sugar have put in so much antimony as to have\r\n produced the effects which the servant girl says she suffered. Dr.\r\n Littlejohn thought it possible, but he had never tried the experiment.\r\n A possibility at the best—a large possibility—that he could have put\r\n in the drug. Was the egg-flip capable of producing the effects which\r\n are said to have been caused by it? ‘Barely possible,’ according to\r\n Dr. Littlejohn. What is its history: does it pass through his hands?\r\n No. It was left by Patterson in the pantry, and Mary McLeod came down\r\n for it to the kitchen. She was told it was in the pantry, and she\r\n goes up to bring it down again. There, again, you have Mary McLeod\r\n intervening in the matter, notwithstanding the dilemma on which the\r\n Solicitor-General placed his case: she it is who carries it up to\r\n the bedroom, and she it is who administers it to the patient who is\r\n suffering there. There is another remarkable thing in this case. The\r\n amount of antimony introduced must have been a very powerful dose,\r\n because, taking only a teaspoonful of the egg-flip as Patterson\r\n did, she lay vomiting and suffering all night. Mrs. Pritchard took\r\n a wine-glassful, and vomited for about half an hour afterwards.\r\n Surely if a strong woman took only a teaspoonful, and a weak woman a\r\n wine-glassful, she would have been destroyed by the poison that had so\r\n powerful an effect on the former.”[165]\r\n\r\nAgain, with reference to the bottle of Battley’s solution found in Mrs.\r\nTaylor’s dress after her death, into which it was suggested that the\r\nprisoner had put the aconite and antimony discovered in it, said Mr.\r\nClark:—\r\n\r\n “He knew, no doubt, that she was taking it, but it is not in the\r\n least degree proved that he knew where it was, in what bottle it was,\r\n or where Mrs. Taylor kept the bottle. Mary McLeod did know, for she\r\n bought it for Mrs. Taylor. But what is the ground of suggestion that\r\n aconite had been put into that bottle before Mrs. Taylor had it? All\r\n that you have is that Drs. Maclagan and Littlejohn say there was,\r\n and that they were contradicted by the person who actually observed\r\n its effects. And what became of this bottle? It was found on her\r\n person after her death. Is it possible to suppose that he had the\r\n means of getting at the bottle before her death to introduce the\r\n poison? How could he? It was carried about her person, and there\r\n is not the slightest suggestion that he ever had access to it; and\r\n yet you are asked to act upon that suggestion, because it is said,\r\n ‘You may probably trace the administration of a medical hand.’ No:\r\n probabilities are not in this case. It is proof, and proof alone, that\r\n we can go on. What was the history of the bottle? It was found in her\r\n clothes, no doubt, when the body was being dressed by Patterson and\r\n Nabb, and even they did not know the very great quantity, perhaps,\r\n that this old lady had taken. But still more, supposing that she\r\n should take no aconite, she had taken sufficient of the mixture to\r\n account for her death. Assuming that the highest mark on the bottle,\r\n as taken by Dr. Paterson, is a correct one, it would come to be not\r\n less than 2¾ ounces that had been taken. It was shown that the bottle\r\n was put by for some time; but if it was taken away after the murder,\r\n that is of very little consequence. If he had put antimony in it,\r\n would it not have been very easy for him to have thrown the bottle\r\n aside? But instead of that, we have him expressing his surprise to\r\n these two women that she had taken such a great quantity. He takes\r\n away the bottle, and brings it back again, and there it remains until\r\n examined by Dr. Penny, who then finds that it contains some aconite\r\n and antimony. But where is the shadow of a proof that he put it there?\r\n The bottle was lying open—was not locked up in any way: it remained\r\n in the house from the death of Mrs. Taylor till after the prisoner\r\n was apprehended, more than a month afterwards. Any person in the\r\n house might have access to it, and yet all that can be suggested to\r\n prove that the prisoner put in this antimony and aconite before her\r\n death was contained in the observation of my learned friend, that you\r\n could trace, or that you could _probably_ trace here, the finger of a\r\n medical man.”[166]\r\n\r\nThe false statement in the certificate of death, Mr. Clark attributed\r\nto a desire of sparing the feelings of the husband. He did not justify\r\nthe morality of the act, but, looking at the circumstances, asked the\r\njury “if there was any degree of guilty knowledge when he asked Dr.\r\nPaterson to inform his father-in-law of the cause of death, and he was\r\nonly forced to take that step by his refusal.” With Dr. Paterson’s\r\nmanner in the witness-box he naturally dealt in the most severe\r\nlanguage of reproof and censure.\r\n\r\n “I do not believe,” he said, in concluding his remarks on this\r\n witness, “he saw any symptoms of poisoning, or he would have acted\r\n as any other medical man would have acted—unselfishly, nobly, and\r\n generously in this matter. And when you see that this is inconsistent\r\n with the whole conduct of the profession to which he belongs, I ask\r\n you to disbelieve many of the statements he makes. You cannot rely\r\n on these statements, given with a bias, for he tells you what is\r\n incredible, or only credible at the loss of his own honour, which I\r\n am sure he will strive studiously to guard. He has become a partisan\r\n in this matter altogether, and forgot what is due to his position and\r\n his profession. All that can be said of Dr. Paterson is this,—that he\r\n speaks about the prisoner, of his mother-in-law, and speaks further\r\n about what he said of her falling; yet even after all, this is merely\r\n an account of a circumstance given by him some months, or, if you\r\n like, a month after the case occurred. And because the prisoner made\r\n some statements not exactly consistent with the truth as now disclosed\r\n on the evidence, are you to believe, on Dr. Paterson’s statement, and\r\n upon his statement only, that these statements were made so as to show\r\n guilty knowledge. I can quite understand that after there is proof of\r\n administration you may support that proof by evidence of falsehoods\r\n which the prisoner may tell, if you have reliable evidence to prove\r\n that they were stated. But when you have no evidence of administration\r\n of poison, then the evidence is all the other way; then I think you\r\n cannot eke out the probabilities of the case by appealing to these\r\n probabilities, or to the falsehoods depending on evidence like that\r\n here, as showing conclusively, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this\r\n prisoner was the person who committed that foul crime upon the person\r\n of his mother-in-law.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus commented on the evidence given for the prosecution on\r\nall the leading points of the case, in masterly, if not convincing\r\narguments, in conclusion the prisoner’s counsel dwelt on the admitted\r\nterms of affection in which he lived with his wife and children—on the\r\nimpossibility of believing in his commission of such a cold-blooded\r\nmurder, on the evidence adduced. “The whole evidence of the Crown,” he\r\nsaid, “hangs upon probability, and can never justify you in believing,\r\nin the first place, that he was capable of committing the crime; and,\r\nin the second, it is hardly conceivable that anything so unnatural\r\nshould be committed by such a man.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGE’S CHARGE.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day, the Lord Justice Clerk summed up the evidence in this\r\nprotracted trial with great minuteness, in the course of his charge\r\nreading to the jury nearly the whole of the evidence, and meeting the\r\nvarious objections to its relevancy offered by the prisoner’s counsel.\r\nThere were three points, he said, for their consideration. (1.) Did the\r\ntwo ladies, or either of them, die from poison? (2.) If aye, was that\r\npoison administered for the purpose of destroying life? (3.) Was it the\r\nprisoner who administered it?\r\n\r\nOn the first point, after calling their attention in detail to the\r\nmedical and analytical evidence in the case of Mrs. Pritchard, that\r\nshe died from slow antimonial poisoning, he said, did not appear to\r\nhave been contested by the prisoner’s counsel, and, upon the evidence,\r\nhe did not think it admitted of a doubt. As the evidence showed that\r\nit was not from a large dose of antimony taken lately before death\r\nthat she had died, the idea of accident or mistake was excluded. That\r\nit might have arisen from unskilful treatment by the prisoner was\r\nnegatived by his assertion that he had never administered antimony to\r\nher, except once externally in October last, which could have nothing\r\nto do with the state in which the intestines were found in March. The\r\nidea of suicide by slow poisoning, even if there had been any hint of a\r\nsuicidal tendency on Mrs. Pritchard’s part, was equally inadmissible:\r\nshe must, if killed by antimony, have had it administered to her for\r\nthat purpose. In Mrs. Taylor’s case, into the details of which he\r\nfully entered, one was almost forced to the conclusion that her death\r\nwas brought about by the combined action of aconite, antimony, and\r\nopium. As to the idea of accident in her case it was inconsistent with\r\nthe fact that the Battley’s solution was pure when bought. “Was it\r\nthen,” he added, “by accident that these two subtle poisons, aconite\r\nand antimony, found their way into her medicine-bottle: if not by\r\naccident, did she put them there herself, or had she any knowledge of\r\nsuch things as to enable her, if she were willing, so to poison herself\r\nby using her own medicine? There was no appearance of that, and the\r\ncharacter and conduct of the old lady, her natural condition both of\r\nbody and mind as you heard it described by the witnesses, is such as\r\nnot to suggest the idea of suicide in her case as a possibility at all.\r\nConsider, then, with reference to both deaths, whether you can arrive\r\nat the conclusion, or whether you can resist the conclusion, that the\r\npoison by the means of which they were deprived of life was wilfully\r\ngiven to them for the very purpose of destroying life.”\r\n\r\nPassing then to the third question, “Was the poison of which these\r\nladies died administered to them by the prisoner?” the Lord Justice\r\nClerk went with great minuteness through the painful details of\r\nMrs. Pritchard’s long and lingering illness, the symptoms which it\r\nexhibited, the prisoner’s misrepresentation of it as gastric fever,\r\nwhen the medical men proved that there was no fever in the case, but\r\nclear signs of antimonial poisoning, and the various acts of the\r\nprisoner during it which were put forward as showing that he had,\r\nand that he used, the opportunities his position offered, for the\r\npurpose of administering the poison. The interest of this portion of\r\nthe charge, as well as of that relating to the symptoms and death of\r\nMrs. Taylor, and the prisoner’s conduct in relation to it, depends so\r\nentirely on the judge’s method of marshalling the evidence, already\r\nreported, that it could not be satisfactorily given except verbatim.\r\nMany of the remarks of the learned judge, on these points of the\r\nevidence, have already been reported in the notes. It will therefore be\r\nsufficient to give, here, his remarks on the question of motive, and on\r\nthe suggestion of the prisoner’s counsel with regard to Mary McLeod.\r\n\r\n “In regard to the matter of motive, I would suggest to you that the\r\n motive that his pecuniary difficulties would be relieved by the death\r\n of Mrs. Taylor, does not seem to have been made out satisfactorily.\r\n You will consider the evidence, but I confess I do not think it worth\r\n while to set it before you again. Then, the question comes to be, was\r\n there a motive? What is there in the shape of a motive that may be\r\n supposed to account for the perpetration of two such horrid crimes?\r\n That is the way it was stated, and ably stated, by the prisoner’s\r\n counsel. But there are some considerations applicable to that part\r\n of the case which I am bound to suggest to you. The absence of\r\n motive, in the ordinary sense of the word, is not a very uncommon\r\n thing in the experiences of a criminal court. In truth, the existence\r\n of any adequate motive for the perpetration of a great crime is a\r\n thing impossible. Still there may be what is called an intelligent\r\n motive—the existence of some foul passion, or some immediate and\r\n strong excitement, which, in a moment of half frenzy, drives a man to\r\n the commission of murder. These are all very evident and intelligible\r\n incentives to crime. But when we find that, in the opinion of the\r\n prisoner’s counsel, there is no motive, it means no more than this,\r\n that the motive has not been discovered. There must have been a motive\r\n or incentive, and yet we may never discover what it was. You are never\r\n in a condition to say that there was no motive, but only that the\r\n motive was not discovered; and the motives of human action, we know\r\n from history and experience, are often inscrutable. Another motive or\r\n incentive has been suggested—the illicit relation between himself and\r\n Mary McLeod. This is a very important part of the case undoubtedly,\r\n and one to which you are bound to give due attention. The prosecution\r\n suggests that the existence of that intercourse was the reason or the\r\n desire that led him to get rid of his wife. If that was the incentive,\r\n I do not think there will be much difficulty in explaining the\r\n incentive to the commission of the other murder; because her presence\r\n in the course of the chronic poisoning of his wife would have been a\r\n great obstruction and interference with his plans.[167] But it is for\r\n you to say whether it is a sufficient motive. It is a fair question\r\n for your consideration, and I should desire you to turn your minds to\r\n it very seriously; keeping only in mind this view, that even supposing\r\n you find it impossible to assign an intelligible motive for the\r\n commission of one or both of these murders, the absence of evidence of\r\n motive is not sufficient reason for acquitting the prisoner, if you\r\n are satisfied from the other evidence in the case that he was guilty.\r\n Motive, after all, can but create a presumption one way or another.\r\n It is not evidence of the fact of murder, that a man has an obvious\r\n motive to commit it; and just as little can the absence of proof of\r\n the existence of a motive be a reason for finding the prisoner not\r\n guilty, if the evidence of the fact of the murder be satisfactory\r\n against him.”\r\n\r\nAgain, after having shown how no imputation could rest on the servants\r\nLattimer and Patterson, the learned judge thus dealt with the\r\nimputation thrown out by the prisoner’s counsel against Mary McLeod:—\r\n\r\n “He has said that there was another girl there who stands in a very\r\n different position, and that it appears, singularly enough, that\r\n whenever an article of food was to be carried to Mrs. Pritchard, Mary\r\n McLeod’s is the hand that bears it. In short, if I understand aright\r\n his theory, it is Mary McLeod who caused these murders, and he invites\r\n you to choose between her and the prisoner, and to pronounce upon\r\n a balance of probabilities which of the two it was. This is a very\r\n painful position for you to be placed in. If it be necessary that you\r\n should decide absolutely between the two it must be done. _At the\r\n same time the prisoner’s counsel did not seem sufficiently to advert,\r\n in considering the point, to the possibility that both might have\r\n been implicated, and, if that was so, I suppose we should have little\r\n doubt which was the master and which was the servant; and, although\r\n the one might be the active hand that administered the poison, if two\r\n were concerned, you would have very little doubt who was the actor,\r\n and who set on the other. And, in fact, if you should arrive at this\r\n conclusion, every article that the prisoner’s counsel alluded to for\r\n the purpose of throwing the guilt on Mary McLeod would be an article\r\n of evidence to implicate the prisoner at the bar._ But I do not desire\r\n you to take this theory. On the contrary, I think it quite right that\r\n you should consider on the balance of probabilities, as has been very\r\n well said, which of the two is the perpetrator of this crime; and in\r\n considering this, it is necessary for you to advert to this—that\r\n the poison was administered in doses—in doses any one of which was\r\n insufficient to kill, but which was quite sufficient, in the agony it\r\n produced, and by the gradual reduction of the strength of the patient,\r\n at length to lead to a fatal termination. Is it conceivable that a\r\n girl of fifteen or sixteen years of age, in the position of a servant\r\n maid, could of herself have conceived and executed such a design,\r\n within this house, under the eye and subject to the vigilance of the\r\n husband of her victim, himself a medical man? That is very hard to\r\n believe. On the other hand, if you can suppose that the prisoner was\r\n the person who conceived and executed this wicked design, it is not\r\n so difficult to believe that Mary McLeod may have been the perfectly\r\n unconscious instrument of carrying out his purpose—suspecting\r\n nothing, knowing nothing of what was being done, and seeing nothing\r\n but great kindness on the part of the prisoner to her mistress, and\r\n seeing them dying, not rapidly as in the case of Mrs. Pritchard, and\r\n though rapidly in that of Mrs. Taylor, still in a way the prisoner\r\n accounted for as a medical man. You may understand easily enough that\r\n a girl in the position of Mary McLeod might be made the unconscious\r\n means of carrying out these designs, and perfectly innocent on\r\n her part. But there is no difficulty in this question. If you are\r\n satisfied that murder was committed, somebody did it. Some of them are\r\n plainly innocent, and therefore the probability of guilt is reduced to\r\n two. Of these two, one or both of them are guilty of this deed.”\r\n\r\nThen with a remark on the suggestion of the prisoner’s counsel, that\r\nMrs. Taylor died of an overdose of opium in the Battley’s solution, the\r\nlearned judge left the case to the jury, who, after about an hour’s\r\ndeliberation, found the prisoner “Guilty,” and he was sentenced to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAfter his conviction, in the hopes of exciting commiseration, Pritchard\r\ndrew up a confession implicating Mary McLeod, but the transparent\r\nfalsehood failing to gain for it any credence, he was induced to\r\nput forward a second, and, subsequently, a third and apparently\r\nfull confession of his guilt. In this last he made the following\r\nstatements: “I am guilty of the death of my mother-in-law, Mrs. Taylor,\r\nand of my wife. I can assign no motive for the conduct which actuated\r\nme, beyond a species of ‘terrible madness,’ and the use of ‘ardent\r\nspirits.’ I hereby freely and fully state that the confession made on\r\nthe 11th of this month (implicating McLeod) was not true, and I confess\r\nthat I alone, and not M. McLeod, poisoned my wife in the way brought\r\nout in the evidence at the trial. Mrs. Taylor’s death was caused\r\naccording to the wording of the indictment and the main facts brought\r\nout at my trial. I hereby fully acknowledge and now plead wholly and\r\nsolely _guilty thereto_, and may God have mercy on my soul.” He was\r\nexecuted on the 27th of July, at Glasgow, in the sight, it was reported\r\nat the time, of nearly one hundred thousand persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RICHMOND POISONING CASE.[168]\r\n\r\n _Before_ THE LORD CHIEF BARON POLLOCK, _at the_ CENTRAL CRIMINAL\r\n COURT, _July 7 and 8, and August 15 to 19, 1859_.\r\n\r\n _For the Prosecution_: Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Mr. Bodkin, Mr. Clerk,\r\n _and_ Mr. Mereweather.\r\n\r\n _For the Defence_: Mr. Serjeant Parry _and_ Mr. Giffard.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST TRIAL—_July 7 and 8._\r\n\r\nThomas Smethurst, æt. 48, surgeon, was indicted for the wilful murder\r\nof Isabella Bankes. The prisoner was a person of small stature and\r\ninsignificant appearance, with reddish-brown moustaches, probably\r\nolder than he stated, and, though appearing careworn, maintained great\r\nself-possession throughout the proceedings, and especially during the\r\nsecond trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\nSerjeant Ballantine, in stating the case to the jury, said it was\r\nalleged that the prisoner took away the life of a fellow creature by\r\npoison, and likewise contrived to throw around the means employed to\r\ndestroy life some more than ordinary difficulties in the way of the\r\ndetection of the crime; that in order to effect this purpose he had\r\navailed himself of the knowledge he possessed, and made use of a slow\r\nirritant poison, which he had administered with his own hands, until,\r\nby the accumulation of poison and irritation, she died.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was represented to be a member of the medical profession:\r\nhe had considerable knowledge of medicine, and was known as Dr.\r\nSmethurst. He was a married man, and had a wife considerably older\r\nthan himself now living. At the time when he should first refer to Dr.\r\nSmethurst, he was living with his wife in a respectable lodging-house\r\nin Bayswater. While they were living there, in the autumn of 1858, Miss\r\nIsabella Bankes also came there to reside. She was a lady of delicate\r\nconstitution,[169] and possessed of property under her own control of\r\nbetween £1,700 and £1,800, and a life interest in £5,000, which, at\r\nher death, went to other members of her family. The result was that\r\nan intimacy sprung up between the parties. In November of that year,\r\nthe landlady, considering that there was too great intimacy between\r\nMiss Bankes and the doctor, spoke to her, and, in consequence, she\r\nleft the house. On the 9th of December, Miss Bankes and the prisoner\r\nwent through the form of marriage at Battersea Church, and, two days\r\nafter, commenced to reside at Richmond. From a letter to his wife\r\nfound on him when in custody, it was evident that the doctor did not\r\nintend this to be a permanent marriage. Until the 28th of January,\r\n1859, nothing was heard of them; then Miss Bankes’s sister Louisa\r\nreceived a letter from her, but not dated from the place where they\r\nwere living. On the 15th of February, the sister received another\r\nletter from her. At that time they were living in Old Palace Gardens,\r\nRichmond. Miss Bankes was then in good health, but, about the 28th\r\nof March, her illness commenced. On the 3rd of April, Dr. Smethurst\r\ndetermined to have medical advice. The landlady advised Dr. Julius, as\r\nhe and his partner, Dr. Bird, were the most eminent practitioners in\r\nRichmond. They were accordingly called in. The former treated her for\r\ndiarrhœa, in the usual way, the complaint from which he understood she\r\nwas suffering, taking his account of her symptoms from Dr. Smethurst.\r\nDr. Julius all through consulted with the prisoner, who took a most\r\nactive part in the matter, and sometimes pressed upon him the use of\r\nvarious medicines. He, however, was only on two occasions allowed to\r\nbe alone with his patient. On the 15th of April, on the landlady at\r\nOld Palace Gardens asking a few shillings more rent, they removed to\r\nAlma Villas—Miss Bankes so weak that she had to be taken in a cab and\r\ncarried upstairs. Dr. Julius, when he found that his remedies had a\r\ncontrary effect to what was intended, asked Dr. Bird to see her, but\r\ndid not mention his own suspicions, though they were very strong. On\r\nthe 18th of April Dr. Bird saw her, prescribed for her, but with the\r\nsame result as his partner. At this time she was sinking, and becoming\r\ncontinually weaker. On that day the prisoner wrote a letter to her\r\nsister Louisa marked “private and confidential.” It stated that her\r\nsister was very ill, and wished to see her: she was to ask for Dr.\r\nand Mrs. Smethurst, and not to breathe a word of the contents of the\r\nnote to anyone. The sister was not at this time aware of the marriage,\r\nand had her own views of her sister’s conduct. She went, however, and\r\nfound her sister in a very feeble state. The deceased said to her, “Oh,\r\ndon’t say anything about it; it will be all right when I get well,\r\nwon’t it dear?” turning to Dr. Smethurst, who said, “Yes, it will be\r\nall right soon.” Dr. Smethurst showed every kindness and attention to\r\nthe deceased during her illness, and to the time of her death she\r\ntreated him with love and affection. Miss Louisa, however, was never\r\nallowed to be for a moment alone with her sister. Whilst she was\r\nthere the prisoner gave the patient a saline draught, and she vomited\r\nimmediately, and complained of its bad taste. Miss Louisa offered to\r\nmake some tapioca, but the prisoner objected on the ground that there\r\nwas not any milk. She then offered to make some arrowroot, but again\r\nhe objected on the ground that the landlady might not like it. That\r\nevening the sister left, and next day wrote to the deceased, to which\r\nletter she received the following reply from the prisoner:—“After\r\nyour departure, dear Bella had a very bad evening and night of it,\r\npurely from the excitement of seeing you, and the fatigue consequent\r\nthereon. Vomiting and purging set in at a fearful rate, which of course\r\nprostrated her greatly. The doctor at once forbade any visitors for\r\nthe present, or he would not be responsible for the effects attendant\r\nthereon.” The prisoner had no doubt made such representations to Dr.\r\nBird as induced him to say that she had better not receive visitors\r\nfor the present. On subsequent days the sister received other letters\r\nfrom the prisoner postponing her intended visits from time to time;\r\ndescribing her sister’s condition, and mentioning that he had insisted\r\non having a consultation with “Dr. Todd, the first physician of the\r\nday, and the two regular attendants who were the first doctors in the\r\nplace.” One of these letters was dated April 30, but made no mention\r\nof his having on that day instructed an attorney in Richmond to draw\r\nup a will upon what he said was a draft by a barrister in London,\r\nbut was really entirely in his own handwriting. On the following day\r\n(Sunday) he called on the attorney, and, representing that the case\r\nwas urgent, induced him to come to the lodging, where the will was\r\nformally executed. By this will the whole of her property was left to\r\nthe prisoner.[170] The consultation with Dr. Todd took place, and he\r\nagreed with other medical attendants that the patient was suffering\r\nfrom unfair treatment. The prisoner, however, on the 29th, wrote to the\r\nsister that Dr. Todd not only acquiesced in what was being done, but\r\nrecommended a perseverance of the treatment, with some slight additions\r\nof his own. This was not the fact, but the prisoner was not made aware\r\nof the suspicions entertained by the medical attendants. They, however,\r\ncaused the evacuations of the deceased to be tested, and the result was\r\nso confirmatory of their views, that they communicated with the police,\r\nand the prisoner was arrested. A number of bottles containing drugs and\r\nmedicines were taken possession of, and on his person was found the\r\nfollowing letter to his wife, sealed and stamped for post:—\r\n\r\n  _Monday, May 2, 1859._\r\n\r\n “MY DEAR MARY,—I have not been able to leave for town as I expected,\r\n in consequence of my medical aid being required in a case of illness.\r\n I shall, however, see you as soon as possible. Should anything\r\n unforeseen prevent my leaving for town before the 11th, I will send\r\n you a cheque for Smith’s money and extras. I will send £5. I am quite\r\n well, and hope you are the same, and that I shall find you so when\r\n I see you—which, I trust, will not be long first. Present my kind\r\n regards to the Smiths and old friends in the house. I heard from\r\n James the other day, who said he had called on you, but that you had\r\n gone out for a walk. With best love, believe me,\r\n\r\n  “Yours affectionately,\r\n  “THOMAS SMETHURST.”\r\n\r\nThe case not being, in the opinion of the Richmond magistrates, strong\r\nenough to justify his committal, the prisoner was discharged. On the\r\nfollowing day, the 3rd of May, Miss Bankes died, a coroner’s inquest\r\nwas held, and the result was the re-arrest of the prisoner, and his\r\nsubsequent committal for wilful murder, for which he was put on his\r\ntrial on the 7th of July.[171]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF MEDICAL ATTENDANTS.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Julius_ said:—\r\n\r\n “He was called in on the 3rd of April to the deceased, who was\r\n represented to be suffering from vomiting and diarrhœa. The prisoner\r\n said he believed that her liver was overloaded with bile. The witness\r\n prescribed accordingly, but without any abatement of the symptoms.\r\n There was no appearance of bile in the evacuations after the third or\r\n fourth day that he saw her, yet the symptoms of diarrhœa and vomiting\r\n continued, with a burning sensation in the bowels and soreness of\r\n the mouth. She complained of a parching throat and a burning thirst.\r\n He could not account for any of these appearances from any natural\r\n disease, and began to entertain an opinion that something of an\r\n irritant character was being administered, and in consequence desired\r\n that his partner, Dr. Bird, should see her. Did not communicate his\r\n suspicions to Dr. Bird, who, taking the prisoner’s account of the\r\n symptoms, and knowing the witness’s prescriptions, adopted his mode\r\n of treatment, but with the same want of success. The medicines were\r\n varied, but the symptoms continued the same. On this the witness\r\n communicated his fears to Dr. Bird, and he on further observation\r\n agreed that the patient was suffering from some irritant, of the\r\n administration of which they knew nothing. During this period the\r\n prisoner always saw the medical attendants, and was always present in\r\n the room when they were with the patient, and recommended or dissuaded\r\n the use of various medicines. He displayed a considerable knowledge\r\n of medicine. On the 28th of April the patient was very ill, and she\r\n repeatedly said to Dr. Bird in the prisoner’s presence that she should\r\n like some one else to be called in. On the same day the prisoner (who\r\n had always expressed a desire that the best medical advice should be\r\n obtained) suggested that Dr. Todd should be called in. On Dr. Todd’s\r\n arrival, witness gave him an outline of the case and treatment, but\r\n did not say anything of the suspicions that had arisen in his mind.\r\n Subsequent to Dr. Todd’s attendance witness procured some of the\r\n evacuations, and in consequence of the examination of them, thought\r\n it his duty to communicate with the magistrates, and the prisoner\r\n was arrested, but released on his own recognizances. Witness was\r\n unable to ascribe the symptoms to any natural cause, but if small\r\n doses of some irritant poison were administered from time to time,\r\n it would have accounted for all the appearances that had exhibited\r\n themselves. Antimony and arsenic would be the character of poisons\r\n likely to produce such results. _There was neither antimony nor\r\n arsenic in any of the medicines he prescribed for her._ The prisoner\r\n told him that she was not in the family way. Dr. Todd had prescribed\r\n a pill containing a quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper and a\r\n quarter of a grain of opium, to which the prisoner objected, as the\r\n copper often produced symptoms of poisoning. On the Saturday the\r\n prisoner said this medicine had produced intense burning in the mouth\r\n and throat, constant vomiting, and fifteen bloody motions—that the\r\n burning was from the “mouth to the anus.” In my judgment it could\r\n not have produced these effects. The evacuation which I obtained was\r\n previous to her taking any of these pills, as they did not arrive\r\n until afterwards. When in prison Dr. Smethurst wrote to me three\r\n letters for the particulars of the medicines that had been given,\r\n which I answered. In the first he also wished to know what solutions\r\n of arsenic were kept in our surgery, _and in the third letter ashed\r\n for the date of the prescription for antimony, which had never been\r\n prescribed_. He also told me that she had been ill just a week—that\r\n previously she had been in very good health, able to take long walks,\r\n in fact out a good deal.”\r\n\r\nOn his _cross-examination, Dr. Julius_\r\n\r\n “Admitted that Smethurst’s communications to him of the symptoms\r\n were made in the clearest and plainest manner, and tallied with his\r\n own observations—that twice he believed he saw the patient without\r\n the prisoner being present; that previous to the 15th of April the\r\n prisoner had suggested to the witness that Drs. Hills or Hassell\r\n should be called in, and a different treatment—one of a very\r\n sedative character, which the witness considered as too powerful,\r\n and, therefore, gave in a more diluted form; that witness had not,\r\n whilst in attendance on Miss Bankes, the slightest suspicion of her\r\n pregnancy, but that, if he had known of it, he should not have made\r\n any difference in his treatment, and now that he did know of it, it\r\n made no difference in his opinion as to the cause of her death. Whilst\r\n admitting that the delivery of a woman who had a first child at the\r\n age of forty-three would be very critical, he stated decidedly, as\r\n the result of his experience, that the period of pregnancy would be\r\n far less critical than in a younger woman. Vomiting was well-known to\r\n be an early—the earliest—sign of pregnancy, but diarrhœa was not;\r\n and though he had heard of a case in which it was accompanied with\r\n diarrhœa, he had not heard of one in which the diarrhœa would not\r\n yield to any ordinary treatment, and the life of the mother was only\r\n saved by the destruction of the fœtus.”[172]\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination Dr. Julius_ stated that “vomiting in early\r\npregnancy had nothing to do with the burning sensation in the mouth\r\nand throat; _that the sickness of Miss Bankes was decidedly not of\r\nthe same character as that of pregnancy, nor was the diarrhœa such as\r\npregnant women sometimes suffer from_.” Dr. Bird, and not the witness,\r\nprescribed bismuth, acetate of lead, and nitrate of silver.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Bird_, who from service in the Crimea in 1855 had had great\r\nexperience and opportunity of studying bowel complaints, confirmed the\r\nevidence of his partner.\r\n\r\n “None of the symptoms were in his opinion reconcileable with any\r\n known disease, but were such as could be accounted for from the\r\n administration of small doses of antimony or arsenic. The prisoner,\r\n he said, told him, on one occasion, that the deceased had seen her\r\n sister, and that it had very much excited her, and in consequence\r\n witness told him that it would be better if she did not come again.\r\n On the 30th he told the prisoner that he wished to take away a\r\n portion of one of her evacuations, that it might be examined under\r\n the microscope to see if any purulent matter was in it, that we might\r\n judge if there was any ulceration of the bowels—that the prisoner\r\n poured out a portion into a tumbler, which he tied over with an old\r\n newspaper, and that the witness took it to his surgery, marked it\r\n No. 2, sealed it with his own seal, and preserved it intact until\r\n delivered to Dr. Taylor with the bottle No. 1 which Dr. Julius had\r\n obtained. A third portion of an evacuation was shown to him by the\r\n prisoner, which he put into a white jam-pot, and marked No. 3. He was\r\n downstairs at the moment Miss Bankes died, but saw her every minute or\r\n two before that. He gave an ample quantity of every ingredient used\r\n in his prescriptions so as to afford a sufficient opportunity for\r\n analyzation.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, he described the various remedies he\r\nprescribed, none of which would account for the symptoms, and stated\r\nthat he formed his opinion that it was a case of slow poisoning by an\r\nirritant, not only from what Dr. Julius and the prisoner told him, but\r\nfrom the vomitings, the motions, and the lady’s own account of her\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caudle_, the assistant of Messrs. Julius and Bird, described the\r\nmedicines he compounded, and _Dr. Buzzard_ detailed the transmission of\r\nthe bottles of evacuations to Dr. Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_POST-MORTEM_ EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Barwell_, Assistant-Surgeon of the Charing Cross Hospital, who,\r\nwith Mr. Palmer, of Mortlake, made a _post-mortem_ examination of the\r\nbody on the 4th of May, said:—\r\n\r\n “I found the back part of the body externally of a dark purple, being\r\n full of blood from the position in which the body lay: I gathered from\r\n that that the blood was more fluid, I should say, than usual. The arms\r\n were perfectly flexible; legs very rigid; feet bent downwards and\r\n turned in, and the muscles at their bottoms very rigid, indicating\r\n cramp or spasm in the lower extremities; the abdomen drawn in and the\r\n muscles tense and hard; the tongue rough, and the _papillæ_ more\r\n elevated than usual. There were no signs of what I could call aphthœ;\r\n the face was much emaciated and of a dull earthy colour; lower lip\r\n drawn in under the upper teeth; front of the body generally of this\r\n dull earthy colour; brain perfectly healthy; nothing wrong about the\r\n lungs—they were healthy. I saw that the liver was firm, full-sized,\r\n rather large, but did not then cut into it. I examined the uterus, and\r\n found the common signs of pregnancy and a fœtus of somewhere between\r\n the fifth and seventh week; the heart and great vessels connected with\r\n it were perfectly healthy. _I examined the liver subsequently; it was\r\n slightly fatty, rather fatty; the remainder hard. The liver when it\r\n becomes fatty is usually soft, but in this instance it was hard, and\r\n it was coloured in the usual manner—speckled._ Gullet healthy, no\r\n signs of inflammation on it. The outside of the stomach, the smaller\r\n end, that nearer the intestine, was red; the larger end, that where\r\n the gullet enters, was of a dark colour; in the centre it was pale. On\r\n examining the inside of the stomach, the narrow part or small end was\r\n also red; at the larger end was a black patch of effused blood; near\r\n the small end the mucous membrane was congested, that is the other end\r\n from the black spot and near where the red was. The contents of the\r\n stomach were a brown mucus mixed with blood and some bile, I should\r\n say. There were no ulcers in the stomach, nor appearance of acute\r\n inflammation. On the outside of the intestine I noticed on the 4th of\r\n May (the first examination) that its commencement was very red, the\r\n small intestines generally were inflated and minutely injected with\r\n blood, and in certain spots they were roughened by lymph, the result\r\n of inflammation, and glued together at certain turns where this lymph\r\n or glutinous inflammation was effused; they were coherent together\r\n from that cause; that did not apply to the entire length of the\r\n intestines, only to a few parts, and chiefly quite the lower parts.\r\n Those are the external symptoms. Internally, the first part of the\r\n intestine (the _duodenum_) was inflamed for about three inches from\r\n its commencement, but the mucous membrane was quite firm, and there\r\n was no ulceration. From that point the rest of the mucous membrane\r\n was only slightly injected, not inflamed. In the next intestine, the\r\n _jejunum_, the mucous membrane was still firm; in places the vessels\r\n were injected with its own blood, but this only in spots. In the\r\n _ilium_, or lower intestine, there was much the same appearance at the\r\n commencement as in the last, _except that approaching the lower part\r\n the injections increased very much, and at last, about 3 feet from\r\n its end, the mucous membrane was greatly altered; there was a deposit\r\n of lymph therein, and a thickening of the membrane; an ill-organized\r\n granular lymph; the membrane at the same time was roughened, and the\r\n glands, which are in the intestine there, were less visible than\r\n usual_. This deposit of lymph did not begin in the glands, but went\r\n over the whole surface of the intestine, and concealed the glands\r\n instead of rendering them more prominent—instead of being deposited\r\n in the glands, was rather around them at first. _This brings me to\r\n the_ cæcum. _On its mucous membrane were many very large spots.\r\n The appearances within the_ cæcum _indicated very serious disease\r\n indeed—inflammation, sloughing, ulceration, and suppuration._ Those\r\n appearances diminished as I went lower down the intestines. _When I\r\n reached the termination, the_ colon, _there was still ulceration,\r\n but in a minor degree. In the_ rectum _there were three ulcerations.\r\n I should also say that in the_ cæcum _were black spots of effused\r\n blood, which were also found along the rest and in the_ rectum. I\r\n have heard the evidence given of the symptoms exhibited during life,\r\n and the treatment adopted. Taking those into consideration, and the\r\n _post-mortem_ appearances, they are not reconcileable with any natural\r\n disease with which I am acquainted.”\r\n\r\n _By the Court._—“What is the conclusion you have formed?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“_That the symptoms and appearances together have resulted\r\n from some irritant, administered frequently during life._”\r\n\r\nIn his _cross-examination_, the earlier portion of which was occupied\r\nwith questions to test the accuracy of the notes of his report, the\r\nwitness explained that the hardness of the liver, which he observed,\r\nwas not a stage of _Cirrhosis_, as he had at first written in his\r\nmemoranda, “but a normal hardness, nothing extraordinary;” that the use\r\nof the term “hard” did not imply that the liver was diseased, but that\r\nthe term “fatty” does.\r\n\r\n _Sergeant Ballantine._—“I think I understood you to convey that there\r\n were no signs of disease about the liver, except this fattiness?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No signs at all except that. That is not a disease of a\r\n nature to affect the _cæcum_ and the intestines in any way.”\r\n\r\n _By the Court._—“Is it in any way connected with diarrhœa and\r\n vomiting?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Samuel Wilks_, who had subsequently examined the intestines with\r\n_Mr. Barwell_, confirmed his statements as to their condition and that\r\nof the liver, and “should think Miss Bankes’ death was most probably to\r\nbe attributed to an irritant.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, he allowed that “severe dysentery produces\r\ngreat inflammation of the intestines, particularly of the larger; that\r\ninflammation, if continued, results in ulceration and destruction of\r\nthe tissues; that the _cæcum_ and _rectum_ would be affected in that\r\nway by dysentery, and that dark spots of effused blood are also a\r\nconsequence of severe dysentery.” His admission, however, rested on his\r\nreading, and not from his experience of cases of acute dysentery, as he\r\nhad seen only “two cases, which they were obliged to call by that name,\r\nnot being able to arrive at any other conclusion as to the cause of\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EXPERTS FOR THE PROSECUTION.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Todd_, Physician to King’s College Hospital, was then called.\r\n\r\n “Dr. Julius,” he said, “told him the nature of the case before he\r\n saw the deceased, but not his suspicions. When he saw her he noticed\r\n a peculiar expression of countenance—an expression of terror, as\r\n though she were under the influence of some one, and that was not\r\n in accordance with the appearance of a patient suffering under\r\n an ordinary disease. The abdomen was very hard—an indication of\r\n extensive inflammation in the stomach—and he was at once under the\r\n impression that she was suffering from some irritant poison. By\r\n witness’s desire an evacuation was obtained, and he directed Dr.\r\n Julius to make up the sulphate of copper and opium pills to allay\r\n irritation. He had never known any bad effect produced by these\r\n medicines, and did not think it could produce a burning sensation\r\n in the throat and stomach. If the disease had been diarrhœa, the\r\n medicines administered by Dr. Julius were the proper ones.”\r\n\r\n _Sergeant Ballantine._—“From all you have heard of this case, what in\r\n your opinion was the cause of this lady’s death?”\r\n\r\n _Dr. Todd._—“_I believe that her death was caused by the\r\n administration of some irritant poison, such as arsenic, antimony, or\r\n corrosive sublimate. The only natural disease that would account for\r\n the symptoms is what would be called acute dysentery._”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination, Dr. Todd_ said:—\r\n\r\n “I have never known any case or cases of early pregnancy of a woman of\r\n about forty to forty-five years of age in which there has been violent\r\n vomiting, violent diarrhœa, and severe dysentery, which no ordinary\r\n medicines would stop, and in which the life of the mother has only\r\n been saved by the abortion of the fœtus. No such cases have come under\r\n my cognizance. I think it possible that excessive vomiting and great\r\n diarrhœa may be caused by the early stage of pregnancy, and symptoms\r\n somewhat allied to those under which this lady died; _but I think it\r\n quite impossible that pregnancy alone, in an early stage, or in any\r\n stage, could, produce extensive ulceration of the bowels_. _I think,\r\n where it is a doubtful case, it is conclusive evidence against the\r\n theory that the symptoms were caused by early pregnancy that you found\r\n such extensive ulceration as existed in this case._”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Buzzard_, who had been a staff-surgeon in the Crimea, _Dr.\r\nCopland_, and _Dr. Bowerbank_, who had had great experience of acute\r\ndysentery in tropical climates, gave it as their opinion that the\r\nsymptoms were not reconcileable with that disease, but were those\r\nof the presence of irritant poison. _Dr. Babington_, Physician to\r\nQueen Charlotte’s Lying-in Hospital, who had attended more than 2,000\r\nwomen in their confinement, did not consider that the death was in\r\nany way attributable to the fact of her being in an incipient state\r\nof pregnancy. On _cross-examination_, whilst admitting that cases\r\nof violent vomiting and diarrhœa in early pregnancy are recorded,\r\nsaid that he did not remember any one of so severe a character as to\r\nendanger life; that he did not think that the lady’s advanced stage of\r\nlife had anything to do with it; that it was a complication generally\r\nat a later period of pregnancy; and that a first pregnancy between\r\n40 and 45 years of age was not more critical in the early stage. On\r\n_re-examination_, with reference to six cases of dysentery, in 1841, in\r\nwhich he had made _post-mortem_ examinations, he said:—\r\n\r\n “There was not the same amount of sloughing of the _cæcum_ as in this\r\n case, nor destruction of the mucous membrane. The glands were in a\r\n different condition. In the dysentery cases, the glands were quite\r\n destroyed, and in three of the cases there was perforation of the\r\n intestine. The symptoms in all six were different to those in this\r\n case; there was no burning sensation of the throat.”\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor._—“On the 1st of May,” said the witness,\r\n“Mr. Buzzard called on me, and brought me two bottles, which he said\r\ncontained matters he wished me to examine. I took about two drachms\r\nfrom one of these bottles (No. 2), and having first examined the\r\ntest and the vessel to be employed, and ascertained that they were\r\npure, I then made the test, and discovered a metallic deposit on the\r\ncopper wire, which, in my opinion, indicated the presence of arsenic\r\nor antimony; but I could not speak to the exact metal. I did not\r\nproceed further at that time, as I desired to have the authority of\r\na magistrate. Bottle No. 2 was then resealed in my presence by Mr.\r\nBuzzard, and taken away by him with bottle No. 1. After he left, as I\r\nwas told that it was necessary to do something to save the life of a\r\nliving person, though it was Sunday, I proceeded with my experiment by\r\nboiling copper gauze in the remainder of the liquid in the tube, and\r\non examining it with a microscope, saw appearances closely resembling\r\nmetallic arsenic; and I then heated a portion of the gauze covered\r\nwith metal in a tube, and obtained crystals of arsenic (wire gauze\r\nwith the crystals on it produced). If you take the tube out, under the\r\nmicroscope the crystals are perfectly clear; in this little sediment,\r\nif you put it against a dark cloth, you will see a little ring of\r\ncrystals—it is quite plain in the sun light. I subsequently applied\r\nthe test of nitrate of silver and nitric acid to crystals obtained\r\nin the same way, and the result convinced me that they were composed\r\nof arsenic. Next day Dr. Buzzard brought back the bottles with the\r\nmagistrate’s order. I then proceeded with the examination of both\r\nbottles, and the result perfectly satisfied me that I was correct in\r\ndiscovering arsenic in bottle 2. My calculation was that there must\r\nhave been at least a quarter of a grain mixed with the four ounces of\r\nmatter in bottle 2.[173] There was no trace of mercury, bismuth, or\r\nantimony, but I did discover the presence of copper by a subsequent\r\ntest; but only such a trace of it as might be accounted for from the\r\ncopper pill taken on the 29th. I examined the evacuation, and came to\r\nthe conclusion that it was such as would pass from a person who had\r\ntaken arsenic, and I immediately advised that the antidote for arsenic,\r\nhydrate of magnesia, should be administered. I subsequently examined\r\nthe other bottle, and found that it did not contain any poison or any\r\nmetallic matter whatever.\r\n\r\n“On the 5th and 7th of May Inspector McIntyre brought me a portion\r\nof the viscera of a human being, which I subsequently submitted to\r\nchemical examination. The officer also gave me a number of bottles, and\r\nseveral pill boxes which I numbered, and subsequently some more. There\r\nwere altogether twenty-eight; and on the 14th of May others which I\r\nalso numbered. In none of the twenty-eight, omitting Nos. 5 and 21, did\r\nI discover anything at all necessary you should be acquainted with. I\r\nexamined them for arsenic. I then examined the bottles containing the\r\nviscera:—first, the _uterus_, which I did not analyse, but agree with\r\nMr. Barwell as to its impregnation; then the _œsophagus_, or gullet,\r\nin which there were indications of some cause of irritation, but no\r\narsenic or antimony; _then the_ stomach, _containing yellowish fluid\r\nwith blood, and found antimony in two distinct places in the small\r\nintestines; the middle portion of the small intestines contained the\r\nlargest quantity, the other part was above and below; some was found\r\nabove and below that and some in the_ cæcum; _altogether the amount\r\nfound in the stomach was very small. In one kidney and in the blood\r\nof the heart there were traces of antimony, and in the blood in the\r\njar_. I was assisted by Dr. Odling, and we came to the conclusion that\r\nthe quantity did not exceed from a quarter to half a grain. I found\r\nthe appearance of the stomach and _cæcum_ such as Mr. Barwell has\r\ndescribed. I then examined the medicines prescribed by Dr. Julius, and\r\nfound them to contain the ingredients of which they were represented\r\nto be composed. I then examined bottle No. 5, and found it to contain\r\n355 grains of chlorate of potash, and free from anything else. That\r\nbottle has been accidentally broken in half. I then examined another\r\nbottle, No. 21, which appeared to contain a clear watery liquid of a\r\nsaline taste, and I tested a portion of the contents by Reintsch’s\r\ntest, and upon first trying the copper it was entirely consumed.[174]\r\nI made a further examination which led me to conclude that there\r\nwas arsenic in the solution, but it turned out that I was mistaken,\r\nand that it did not contain either arsenic or antimony, and that the\r\narsenical appearances originally produced came from the copper gauze.\r\nBy the destruction of the gauze the arsenic in it was set free, and\r\nthis destroyed the effect of the experiment. _The quantity of arsenic\r\nthat I discovered, I should say, was less than half a grain._ In the\r\nexperiment I made with this bottle, the arsenic was deposited by\r\nmyself. Dr. Odling also came to the same conclusion—that the bottle\r\ncontained arsenic, and we both stated that fact in our examination\r\nbefore the magistrates and the coroner, but we were, of course,\r\nmistaken. We believed, no doubt, at the time, that the arsenic we\r\nfound was in the bottle which contained chlorate of potash—a cooling\r\nmixture. I have used the same description of gauze for many years, and\r\nhave never before found arsenic in it. I shall certainly continue to\r\nuse it, but shall take care not to do so with chlorate of potass.”\r\n\r\n_Serjeant Parry_ here called for the deposition of Dr. Taylor made\r\nbefore the magistrates, a portion of which was read. It stated that he\r\nhad discovered arsenic in bottle No. 21, in which there was chlorate\r\nof potass; that the latter was a harmless saline mixture acting upon\r\nthe kidneys, and that if poison had been given in it, its effect would\r\nprobably be to carry off the noxious ingredient from the body very\r\nquickly, but that by repetition constantly of such a proceeding chronic\r\ninflammation would be created which would yield to no treatment, and\r\nwould end in the death of the patient from exhaustion.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Taylor_ then continued:—\r\n\r\n “At the time I gave this evidence I firmly believed that arsenic was\r\n contained in the mixture and that it had not come from my test, but\r\n had been placed there by some one. When before the coroner I expressed\r\n my opinion that the death was referable to antimony and arsenic.\r\n _The finding of the arsenic in the bottle did not have any effect\r\n upon the opinion I subsequently formed with reference to the case._\r\n The moment I discovered the mistake I had made I informed Serjeant\r\n Ballantine. No arsenic was found in the body of deceased. I did not\r\n form my theory to account for the absence of arsenic from the tissues\r\n of the body, that it had been carried off by the chlorate of potass.\r\n It did not enter into my consideration beyond this, that it acts\r\n generally as a diuretic. After Dr. Odling and myself had given our\r\n evidence relative to finding the arsenic in the bottle of chlorate of\r\n potass, we thought it was possible there might be some mistake, and\r\n we made other experiments to satisfy ourselves. We made seventy-seven\r\n experiments with the same kind of gauze, and in seventy-six no arsenic\r\n was discovered: and the only instance in which it was found was in\r\n the evacuation in bottle 2.” The witness also said that he could\r\n not, after hearing the symptoms and the treatment of the deceased,\r\n attribute the death to any other cause than the administration of some\r\n irritant poison.\r\n\r\nThis witness was also cross-examined at considerable length as to the\r\nsymptoms of slow poisoning by arsenic and by antimony, in which he\r\nagreed with the previous witnesses, adding to their evidence the fact\r\nof its operation in causing enlargement of the liver, and the deposit\r\nof fat in it. Hence the use of sulphide of antimony to fatten the geese\r\nused in Strasburg, in the manufacture of Perigord Pies. On the subject\r\nof dysentery he could not speak, having ceased to practise as a medical\r\nman, and confined his attention to analyses.\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination, Dr. Taylor_ said that “the half grain of copper,\r\ngiven in the pill during life, would not by any action of any acid\r\nin the stomach account for the quantity of arsenic found in the\r\nevacuation; that he had examined and found no arsenic in the copper\r\npills; and that though arsenic was found in the sulphate of copper\r\ntaken from the surgery, there was not a quantity to be seen; there was\r\nno arsenic in the bismuth, and no antimony in the medicines. Arsenic is\r\nsometimes found in bismuth.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Odling_, Professor of Practical Chemistry at Guy’s Hospital, who\r\nhad assisted Dr. Taylor in his experiments, 2ì”confirmed Dr. Taylor’s\r\naccount in every respect, and expressed himself satisfied that there\r\nwas antimony in the body of the deceased. He agreed also in attributing\r\nthe death to the administration of some irritant poison, and did not\r\nknow any natural disease that would account for the symptoms spoken\r\nof.”\r\n\r\n_William Thomas Brande_, formerly Professor of Chemistry to the Royal\r\nInstitution, and for fifty years engaged in the practice of chemistry,\r\n“had examined a portion of the liquid (the chlorate of potass), and\r\ncome to the conclusion that it did not contain arsenic. Reinsch’s test\r\nfor arsenic was reliable where chlorate of potass was not present.”\r\n“Our first object,” said the witness, on cross-examination, “was to get\r\nrid of the chlorate of potass, or to decompose it so as to render it\r\ninert, which we did; and we then examined the liquid in question, and\r\nfound no arsenic in it.”\r\n\r\n _To the Court._—“I was not aware that Reinsch’s test would be\r\n inapplicable to such a compound, and if I had applied it, and the\r\n result appeared as it did to Drs. Taylor and Odling, I should have\r\n come to the same conclusion, that there was arsenic in the substance.\r\n _The matter that has appeared since is to a certain extent new to the\r\n chemical world. We have always been aware of the presence of very\r\n minute quantities of arsenic in copper, but we have never considered\r\n it as interfering in any way until this particular case._”[175]\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL AND ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient, as in the previous trials, to report at this\r\nperiod the medical and analytical evidence offered on the part of the\r\nprisoner, subsequent to the address of Serjeant Parry. This was devoted\r\nto the following points: (1), the absence of some of the well-known\r\nsymptoms in slow poisoning by arsenic or antimony, or by both; (2), the\r\nsimilarity of the symptoms in this case to those exhibited in cases of\r\nacute dysentery; (3), the occurrence of severe diarrhœa, with vomiting\r\nin the _early_ stages of pregnancy; (4), that the non-discovery of\r\neither arsenic or antimony in the tissues of the body could not be due\r\nto its being given in, or with chlorate of potass; (5), the probability\r\nthat both the arsenic and the antimony found in the evacuations and\r\nintestines might be due to the presence of arsenic in the bismuth, and\r\nof antimony in the grey powders administered as medicines. In support\r\nof these opinions four doctors and analysts, all belonging to what\r\nwas known as the Grosvenor School of Medicine, were examined, two of\r\nwhom (Dr. Richardson and Mr. Rodgers) had given evidence for Palmer at\r\nhis trial, Dr. Richardson then suggesting that Cook’s symptoms were\r\nreconcileable with an attack of _Angina pectoris_, and Mr. Rodgers\r\nsupporting the view that if strychnia had been given to Cook, it must\r\nhave been discovered in his body by chemical analysis.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Richardson_, after generally asserting that the symptoms in Miss\r\nBankes’ case were not in the main reconcileable with either slow\r\narsenical or antimonial poisoning, or both, enumerated the following as\r\nabsent if it was a case of slow antimonial and arsenical poisoning:—\r\n\r\n “1st, the inflammation of the conjunctival membrane of the eye; 2nd,\r\n soreness of the inner surface of the nostril; 3rd, a skin disease\r\n peculiar to arsenical poisoning; 4th, excoriation, amounting to\r\n absolute destruction, possibly, of the surface at the orifice of the\r\n mucous tracts, the mouth, the anus, the lips, and the vagina—and,\r\n lastly, and, in his opinion, the most important, the absence of\r\n the peculiar nervous symptoms which he should expect to find\r\n which characterise arsenical poisoning—frequent convulsions of a\r\n violent kind, in many cases; or in others, where the symptoms may\r\n be prolonged, tremor of the whole limbs, a suppressed convulsion in\r\n fact. _Although he should not expect to find all these symptoms in a\r\n case of arsenical poisoning, he believed it to be quite impossible\r\n that a case of arsenical poisoning could exist from which they would\r\n all be absent._—The results of the _post-mortem_” he said, “were\r\n inconsistent with arsenical poisoning, because the inflammation that\r\n would establish it was most demonstrated in the part ordinarily\r\n most free in such poisoning—that, had it been a case of arsenical\r\n poisoning, arsenic must have been found in the tissues, and, had it\r\n been given in chlorate of potass, the whole of it would not have been\r\n eliminated. He based this opinion on an experiment he had lately made\r\n on a large dog, to which in sixteen days he had given 18 grains of\r\n arsenic and 365 of chlorate of potass, in small doses, two or three\r\n times a day, and then killed and examined and chemically analysed in\r\n conjunction with Dr. Thudichum and Dr. Webb, two of the witnesses for\r\n the defence. In this animal he found arsenic in the liver, lungs, and\r\n heart, a trace in the spleen and in the kidneys, but the greater part\r\n in the liver. He could venture to say that he found half a grain.”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“_Give me leave to say, that the value of this\r\n experiment is nothing if you give a dog arsenic day by day for sixteen\r\n days, and then it is killed, and some arsenic is found left in it; is\r\n that all it proves?_”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“_No; it was done to prove whether the chlorate would\r\n eliminate the arsenic as fast as it was given._”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“_All that the experiment proves is, that chlorate\r\n of potass does not eliminate the whole of the arsenic, because it\r\n eliminated all but half a grain._”\r\n\r\nThe witness then went on to show, by experiments on two other dogs,\r\nthat the administration of chlorate made no difference either as\r\nregards symptoms, pathology, or the chemical result. Speaking again of\r\nthe sweating as one of the symptoms in antimonial poisoning absent in\r\nMiss Bankes’ case, _he admitted that he had seen it only in one case,\r\nand that, where it had been given in excess, for a long time, and in\r\nlarge doses medicinally, and that in two other cases of acute poisoning\r\nby antimony there was no particular eruption, because, as he said, the\r\nattack was not long enough_. Such was all the experience he had had in\r\ncases of slow poisoning. As to the effects of antimony on the liver,\r\nhe could only speak from some experiments on animals in 1856-7, and\r\nthat, in reality, he had no experience at all in slow poisoning, except\r\nfrom experiments on animals. Of dysentery, too, he knew very little;\r\nhad seen two or three cases, _but had never met with it in the early\r\nstage of pregnancy; he had met with one between the third and fourth\r\nmonth, but not between the fifth and seventh week_. He had analysed the\r\nbismuth usually administered in medicine, and had found nearly half\r\na grain of arsenic in an ounce, and, in a case in which 90 grains of\r\nthat drug had been given at the rate of 5 grains three times a day—for\r\ndyspepsia—with Drs. Thudichum and Webb he found about the fiftieth of\r\na grain of arsenic in the urine.\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of this witness was mainly occupied by\r\nquestions about his evidence on Palmer’s trial, and in trying to\r\nelicit from him that these canine experiments had been made for the\r\npurposes of the present case. The latter he denied, but admitted that\r\nhe had made them after reading the examinations before the magistrate\r\nand the coroner, and that though he did not communicate them to the\r\nprisoner, he talked about them so frequently to his colleagues at\r\nthe Grosvenor School, that he was not surprised at being interviewed\r\nby the prisoner’s solicitor and asked to give evidence for his\r\nclient. As to his evidence on Palmer’s trial, he maintained that\r\nhe did not endorse the theory that Cook died of _Angina pectoris_;\r\nthat he did not negative the idea of strychnia, but at last admitted\r\nthat he could not deny that he went there to support the theory of\r\n_Angina pectoris_.[176] In the cases of the dogs his analysis was\r\nnot quantitative: he was content with the fact that the arsenic was\r\npresent. He negatived the idea that the ¼ of a grain of copper in the\r\npill would produce a burning sensation from the mouth to the anus, _but\r\nadmitted that any irritant given for a long time would unquestionably\r\nproduce that effect_. The form of dysentery to which a lady with such\r\na liver as Miss Bankes’ would be subject, would be subacute, not that\r\narising from poison, but which is prolonged over a very considerable\r\ntime: not chronic, but something between chronic and acute, but too\r\nsevere to be strictly chronic; that would not harden the coats of the\r\nstomach; would produce a great deal of mischief in the bowels; would\r\nnot thicken them, but probably lead to a deposit of false membrane:\r\nit would not harden them, but a false membrane would; if there was\r\ngreat congestion, the wall would be thicker. He had not acted as an\r\naccoucheur since 1854, but was of opinion that sickness accompanied by\r\ndysenteric diarrhœa, in the early stage of pregnancy, might have been\r\nthe cause of all the appearances exhibited in this case. Diarrhœa was\r\nsometimes an incident of and caused by pregnancy; the opposite effect,\r\nconstipation, was not more usual.\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_, the witness qualified his admission as to the\r\neffect of the copper pill to this extent, that, “in a patient suffering\r\nfrom violent irritation, arising either from a natural or mechanical\r\ncause, sulphate of copper would have a tendency to increase that\r\nirritation; and he justified his reliance on the experiments on animals\r\non their forming the great bulk of scientific knowledge in Europe on\r\nthe subject of poisons and their operation on the human frame, and\r\nby the fact that the materials for forming a judgment of the effects\r\nof slow antimonial poisoning on the human subject were very bare,”\r\nand concluded by saying, that, “after his cross-examination, and his\r\nattention having been called to all the points deemed important, he\r\nstill adhered to his opinion that the deceased lady might have died\r\nfrom natural causes.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. J. E. D. Rodgers_, Professor of Chemistry in Knowle College, but\r\nfor seventeen years at the Grosvenor School, agreed with Dr. Richardson\r\nthat chlorate of potass would have no effect in eliminating arsenic or\r\nantimony from the human system; that the absence of arsenic or antimony\r\nfrom the tissues, and especially from the liver, would cause him to\r\ndoubt whether the allegation of poisoning was correct, and that he did\r\nnot think it possible to find it in the blood and not in the liver,\r\n“as the blood in the heart must be regarded as a sample of the whole\r\n28 lbs. circulating in the system, and, if you find the poison in one\r\nsmall portion, you must find it wherever the blood flows.” He confirmed\r\nthe amount of arsenic said to be in bismuth, and had found antimony\r\nin grey powder: should expect to find, in a case of slow poisoning,\r\nthe symptoms spoken to by Dr. Richardson, and, if he did not find any\r\narsenic in a body from which an evacuation containing one-sixth of a\r\ngrain came, it would lead him to doubt whether the experiment had been\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n_Dr. J. L. W. Thudichum_, Lecturer on Chemistry at the Grosvenor\r\nSchool, and a pupil of Liebig’s, attributed the death to what he\r\ncalled _diphtheritic dysentery_, of which he had seen two cases,\r\nand, on opening the body in one case, found the false membrane from\r\nwhich the disease takes its name. The only medical work in which he\r\nhad seen this form of dysentery described was _Rokitansky’s Morbid\r\nAnatomy_.[177] It was not, however, at all necessary to find the false\r\nmembrane, as it might be broken up and discharged, and hearing that\r\nshreddy matters were found in the evacuations, would confirm his view.\r\nHe quite concurred with the previous witnesses as to the symptoms\r\nthey would expect to find in a case of slow arsenical or antimonial\r\npoisoning. He had analysed grey powder and bismuth. In the former he\r\nfound caustic and carbonate of lime, mercury partly oxidised, silica,\r\nwith phosphate of iron, arsenic and antimony—more arsenic than\r\nantimony; in the bismuth he found both arsenic and antimony—more than\r\na trace—enough to answer the test two or three times—an appreciable\r\nquantity. “I dare say,” he said, “there was half a grain in 20 grains.\r\nIt is almost necessary, from the mode of its preparation, that it\r\nshould contain arsenic.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, the witness admitted that he had not made any\r\nquantitative analysis, because they were so laborious; had used in his\r\nexperiment about one-sixteenth of 2 ounces of the grey powder, which\r\nhe dissolved; neither the grey powder nor the bismuth had anything to\r\ndo with the death of Miss Bankes, but the fact of bismuth containing\r\narsenic might account for the traces in the evacuation, and if antimony\r\nwas taken in a medicine it might account for the analysis, but this\r\nwould depend upon the quantity in the medicine.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Cornelius Webb_, Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology\r\nat the Grosvenor School, and Physician to the Great Northern Hospital,\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n “From all he had heard deposed to in court he was of opinion that the\r\n deceased died from natural causes that might be accounted for—that\r\n the fact of her being in an early state of pregnancy ought most\r\n decidedly to be taken into consideration; _though he did not know\r\n of a case, he was of opinion, founded on practical experience and\r\n general knowledge, that severe vomiting and severe diarrhœa which\r\n would not yield to ordinary treatment may arise from an early state\r\n of pregnancy—that Miss Bankes died from dysentery, made worse by the\r\n condition of early pregnancy, and that a burning sensation in the\r\n mouth is consequent upon dysentery, and the diarrhœa and vomiting\r\n of pregnancy. All the symptoms in her case might arise from the\r\n vomiting and diarrhœa of pregnancy_. The ulceration in the stomach,\r\n obliteration and partial destruction of the mucous membrane, the\r\n effusion of blood under it, and the dark patchy spots and ulcers and\r\n injection generally of the membrane might, as Dr. Wilkes said, arise\r\n from dysentery. If the deceased at one time had an affection of the\r\n womb, for which she used nitrate of silver (a pint bottle of this\r\n was found in her room), it would indicate ulceration of the neck\r\n of the womb; and if there had been such a condition of the womb an\r\n appreciable time before pregnancy, it might add to the irritation of\r\n pregnancy. Unless he found other symptoms, the vomiting, diarrhœa,\r\n sensation of the throat and the intestinal canal, accompanied by\r\n ulcerous appearances in parts of the body, would not, in his judgment,\r\n necessarily lead to the conclusion that she must be the subject of\r\n irritant poisoning—unless he found other symptoms, it would not enter\r\n his head. In a case of antimonial poisoning he should expect to find a\r\n clamminess and cold perspiration of the skin. In arsenical poisoning\r\n he should expect to find arsenic in the kidneys and the spleen, as\r\n well as the liver; should expect to find it in the liver first—it\r\n is the great criterion. And from the absence of these symptoms and\r\n appearances in this case, he was fortified in his opinion that she\r\n died from natural causes.”\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of this witness was mainly directed to his\r\nassertion that, “in such a case as this, had he been called in at its\r\nearly stage, notwithstanding he was told that she was not pregnant, and\r\nthat her courses were in order, he should have examined the patient for\r\npregnancy, especially if he found that the remedies were useless in\r\nstopping the vomiting and diarrhœa.”\r\n\r\n “Dysentery,” he said, “was a most common disease, and in such a state\r\n as Miss Bankes was, the quarter-of-a-grain copper pill might increase\r\n the irritation. Diphtheritic dysentery was a form of idiopathic\r\n dysentery, that is, occurring without any particular poison—the\r\n Eastern form; there is a dysentery that arises from natural poison,\r\n just the same as fever. If I had been acquainted with all the symptoms\r\n I have heard described in court, I should not have dreamt of poison.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. G. F. Girdwood_, who had delivered upwards of 3,000 women,\r\nstrongly supported the view of the death being due to the effects of\r\ndysentery, combined with pregnancy. “Idiopathic dysentery would be\r\nits proper name—a special disease originating in itself, one single\r\nmalady, one single suffering. He had had several cases of dysentery\r\nat early stages of pregnancy, one of them very severe, in fact,\r\ncontemporaneous with it—he should say symptomatic of pregnancy: this\r\nwould be much aggravated by a bilious temperament, and any affection of\r\nthe liver.”\r\n\r\n On _cross-examination_ the witness explained that “in this country\r\n idiopathic dysentery assumed a less severe form than in warm\r\n climates—was what is called subacute or chronic, and that the state\r\n of the cæcum indicated a case of _subacute, not of severe dysentery,\r\n of prolonged dysentery_, and that it did not necessarily follow that\r\n such a case should commence with febrile symptoms.” On re-examination\r\n he stated, that “in early pregnancy the dysenteric motions have become\r\n bloody, the sign of dysentery which may come on immediately or not;\r\n in a day or two in acute dysentery, the result of neglected diarrhœa.\r\n _Subacute dysentery_ is frequently the result of neglected diarrhœa,\r\n or chronic dysentery—you have acute, subacute, and chronic.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. James Edmunds_, Surgeon to the Royal Maternity Charity, cited\r\na case in his own practice of a woman of about forty years of age,\r\nwho had been married ten or twelve years, and who in her pregnancy\r\nsuffered from vomiting, purging, and severe pain in her abdomen,\r\nand who, from the _post-mortem_ examination which he made, he was\r\nconvinced died of dysentery, complicated by vomiting and irritability\r\nof the stomach attributable to pregnancy, and purging attributable to\r\ndysentery. “Purging,” he said, “was often a symptom at an early stage\r\nof pregnancy, and often of impending labour.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, however, he admitted that when he first\r\nattended this woman, _when the symptoms first began, she had been\r\npregnant five or six months_.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Tyler Smith_, the last medical witness called for the defence, in\r\npractice for fifteen years as an accoucheur, said that\r\n\r\n “He was acquainted with cases in which excessive vomiting in pregnancy\r\n had caused death—where it went on after pregnancy had commenced,\r\n sometimes during the whole period, but these were exceptional cases.\r\n It would require considerable skill to determine accurately the age\r\n of a fœtus, as you may have a case in which it may die and remain _in\r\n utero_ without development, though no decomposition takes place. He\r\n had known one case in which there was a great amount of vomiting and\r\n some amount of purging, in which the friends of the lady could not\r\n be brought to believe that her husband was not poisoning her. These\r\n symptoms might become so violent as to be mistaken for a case of\r\n poisoning; the expression on the face in such cases was that of death\r\n by starvation.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, he admitted that though he had seen cases of\r\ndeath in pregnancy from vomiting conjoined with purging, he believed\r\nthe vomiting to be the great cause of death, and that ordinarily, if\r\ndysentery is excessive, abortion is produced. On _re-examination_, he\r\nsaid “that in the case of a woman of from forty to forty-five years\r\nof age, doses of irritant poison were more likely to procure abortion\r\nthan idiopathic disease.” To a question by a juryman, he said, “any\r\nirritating medicine would tend to keep up dysentery.”\r\n\r\nWith the evidence of a dentist (Pedley) who had attended the prisoner\r\nabout the middle of February last, and recommended the use of chlorate\r\nof potass for foulness of breath, the evidence for the defence was\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGE’S CHARGE.\r\n\r\n_The Lord Chief Baron_, in his address to the jury, which occupied\r\neight hours and a half, and of which, therefore, only the leading\r\npoints can be given, said:—\r\n\r\n “As to the marriage of the prisoner and the deceased—though in\r\n itself a breach of the law and a felony—the jury ought not to allow\r\n it to have any weight, excepting so far as it operated, with the\r\n other facts in the case, upon the question whether the prisoner was\r\n guilty or innocent of the more serious crime laid to his charge.\r\n It appeared to him that it was a most important subject for their\r\n consideration—the position of the deceased at the time the fatal\r\n event occurred, and also what she believed to be her position with\r\n the prisoner. In the letter she wrote to her sister she stated she\r\n was happy, and she also told her sister when she first saw her during\r\n her illness, that when she got well all would be right. What did she\r\n mean by that expression, and what would have become of the prisoner\r\n if she had got well, he having a wife living? In the will that had\r\n been made by the deceased, she appeared to have been studiously called\r\n ‘spinster,’ and she signed her name, ‘Isabella Bankes,’ and how she\r\n could have done this, knowing that she had gone through the ceremony\r\n of marriage with the prisoner, and might, therefore, naturally have\r\n supposed herself entitled to the name of ‘Smethurst,’ was certainly\r\n a very mysterious and extraordinary circumstance.[178] He could not\r\n help observing on the circumstances under which the will was made. The\r\n prisoner had certainly told Mr. Senior a falsehood, and he did not\r\n appear to scruple to degrade most seriously the unhappy lady for the\r\n purpose of having the will prepared in the form he required. If he\r\n had told the attorney the truth, he would never have drawn the will\r\n in the form in which it appeared. Again, at the very period when this\r\n unhappy woman was lying in agony on her death-bed, and according to\r\n the prisoner’s statement unable to bear the excitement of seeing her\r\n sister, he took into her room on the Sunday an entire stranger, and\r\n there a will prepared by himself was read to her, and executed by her\r\n under the circumstances of degradation to which he had alluded. Thus\r\n this poor dying woman, from whom all her relations had been excluded,\r\n had a stranger thrust into her presence, and was allowed to pass into\r\n the other world without one word of religious consolation, as if she\r\n had been a beggar and an unbeliever in a heathen land. Again, as to\r\n the pecuniary motive, on the supposed inadequacy of which counsel\r\n had commented because she would have been entitled to receive the\r\n interest of the £5000 (£150) only during her lifetime, it should not\r\n be forgotten that by her will he would be at once in the possession of\r\n a sum equal to twelve years’ purchase of that dividend.”\r\n\r\n “The illness of the deceased appeared to have commenced very soon\r\n after the parties arrived at Richmond; the prisoner appeared to have\r\n described it as a bilious attack; he undoubtedly appeared desirous\r\n to have additional medical aid, and Dr. Julius was in consequence\r\n called in. In both the lodgings he appeared to have performed all the\r\n offices that were necessary in connection with the patient, although\r\n it was perfectly clear that he had ample means for providing the\r\n necessary attendance. The jury would consider what bearing this had\r\n on the case. Did he refuse to have a nurse because he did not wish to\r\n have a witness in that bedroom? He not only refused to have a nurse,\r\n but he wrote to the deceased’s sister to prevent her from visiting\r\n her sister. He said that he could not afford a nurse, yet at this\r\n very time the deceased had an income of at least £220 a year. It also\r\n appeared that no portion of any of the food given to the deceased\r\n was allowed to remain; it was always thrown away, so that no person\r\n ever had an opportunity of tasting it. This was one of the facts of\r\n the case, from which the jury would draw their own inference. It was\r\n a fact in favour of the prisoner that neither arsenic nor antimony\r\n was found at his lodgings or on his person. He had, however, ample\r\n opportunity between his discharge on the Monday and his re-arrest\r\n on the following day, of getting rid of any poison, and if the jury\r\n thought that the deceased really died of poison, the fact that none\r\n was found in the prisoner’s possession would not have much weight.\r\n\r\n “After the first interview, the prisoner had taken every means in his\r\n power to prevent the deceased from seeing her sister, on the ground\r\n that the doctor forbade it[179]—which was not true. Why was not the\r\n sister informed on the 30th, when she was allowed to see the deceased\r\n again, that she had made a will, and what could be the object of the\r\n prisoner in wishing that the young woman who was to witness the will\r\n should be told it was a ‘Chancery paper’ and not a will? The fact of\r\n the sister having been sent away on the day before the death, was\r\n probably more in connection with the will, and from fear lest the\r\n deceased should, at the last moment, revoke it in favour of a beloved\r\n sister, than with the actual death—but it was a fact in the case. It\r\n was also a fact in the case, that after the prisoner ceased to attend\r\n on the deceased she ceased to vomit, and that the prisoner said that\r\n as the parties about the deceased had interfered, he should take no\r\n further responsibility, nor pay for anything, though at that time\r\n he had money of the deceased’s at his bankers.[180] It was another\r\n fact to be considered that the draft of the will was entirely in the\r\n prisoner’s handwriting, and that there was no evidence that it was\r\n drawn by a barrister as he represented.”\r\n\r\nOn the medical testimony, the _Chief Baron_ said:—\r\n\r\n “The medical witnesses called for the defence thought the symptoms of\r\n this case inconsistent with slow poisoning, and that had arsenic or\r\n antimony been the cause of death, some portions of those substances\r\n would have been found in the body.[181] These statements were,\r\n however, the opinions of scientific men, the result of reading\r\n and study, and the jury would have to consider how far it weighed\r\n against the evidence of those scientific witnesses who had seen the\r\n patient when living, and had observed personally all the symptoms\r\n that manifested themselves. The medical men first called in found\r\n themselves baffled by the disease; the medicines not only did not\r\n alleviate the symptoms, but did not produce even their natural\r\n effects. They, therefore, came to the conclusion that something was\r\n being administered which counteracted their medicines. Dr. Todd, one\r\n of the most eminent physicians of the day, was called in, and came to\r\n the same conclusion. These gentlemen, and other competent witnesses,\r\n who had not seen the patient while living, were equally of opinion\r\n that the symptoms were not ascribable to any natural causes; but were\r\n those which would arise from the administration of an irritant poison.\r\n The counsel for the prisoner had laid much stress upon the mistake\r\n made by Dr. Taylor in one of his tests, and asked them to dismiss Dr.\r\n Taylor’s evidence from their consideration. He did not agree with\r\n this. The failure of Dr. Taylor’s analysis in one instance arose\r\n from a new and hitherto unknown fact in science, and did not in any\r\n way invalidate his testimony.[182] It appeared to him that no answer\r\n had been given to the main point urged by the prosecution—that no\r\n medicine whatever had the slightest effect upon the malady under which\r\n the deceased was suffering. _He did not agree with the prisoner’s\r\n counsel, that the real question for the jury was to consider which set\r\n of medical witnesses were entitled to credit. The medical evidence was\r\n important, but the jury must, in addition, look at all the other facts\r\n of the case, and particularly to the conduct of the prisoner and the\r\n motives for his crime._ They must, after all, be guided by those rules\r\n of common sense that would operate on the minds of reasonable men\r\n with regard to the more important actions of their lives; _and even\r\n supposing that there were no medical testimony at all in the case,\r\n they would still have, as it appeared to him, a very grave question to\r\n decide with reference to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner_.”\r\n\r\nThe jury, after deliberating for twenty minutes, returned a verdict\r\nof “Guilty.” When the prisoner, who appeared thunder-struck at the\r\nverdict, was called upon to say why sentence of death should not be\r\npassed on him, he speedily recovered his self-possession, and addressed\r\nthe Court in a powerful, though rambling speech, in which he attempted\r\nto explain away some portions of his conduct, strongly asserted his\r\ninnocence, and denounced Dr. Julius, against whom he appeared to\r\nentertain a bitter animosity. Again, when the usual sentence had been\r\npassed upon him, which he heard without emotion, he denounced Dr.\r\nJulius as his murderer, and declared that “he was innocent before God.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the verdict given than its correctness was questioned\r\nalike by the legal and the medical profession, each discussing it\r\nwithin its own domain, the doctors confining themselves too exclusively\r\nto the conflict of medical testimony, the lawyers confining their\r\ndisputes too exclusively to the collateral facts of the case. Such,\r\nhowever, was the discussion between the two professions, that the Home\r\nSecretary (Sir G. Cornewall Lewis) deemed it advisable to reprieve the\r\nculprit until the case had undergone deliberate revision.\r\n\r\nBy the account given by Mr. Justice Stephen, based on the notes and\r\npapers of the late Lord Chief Baron, it would appear that, in addition\r\nto the numerous letters (some very foolish on both sides) sent to him,\r\nand transmitted by him to the Home Secretary, two communications,\r\ndescribed as “somewhat hastily prepared,” were forwarded from _Dr.\r\nBaly_ and _Dr. Jenner_. These urged that “sufficient weight had not\r\nbeen given to the fact of the pregnancy and the ambiguous character of\r\nthe symptoms,” and, some of the letters added, “their inconsistency\r\nand incompatibility with poison.” As the reasons on which these\r\n“somewhat hastily prepared communications” were based are not divulged,\r\nit is impossible to judge of their value. The learned Judge, on the\r\ncontrary, called the Home Secretary’s attention to the statement in\r\nthe memorial to the Prince Consort (already quoted, note, p. 474), to\r\ncertain entries in Smethurst’s diary, not proved at the trial, and\r\nnot now given, showing that he had wilfully misstated the symptoms of\r\nthe patient, and to a statement in a letter of _Mr. Herapath_ in the\r\n_Times_ that the quantity of arsenic extracted from the chlorate of\r\npotass was larger than could have been released from the copper gauze.\r\n(See Chapter IX. p. 509.) On receiving this report the Home Secretary\r\nreferred the whole of the documents, together with the copy of the\r\nevidence, to Sir B. Brodie. His reply, which, it is reported, dealt\r\nnot only with the medical, but the moral evidence of Smethurst’s\r\nguilt,[183] concluded in these words: “Taking into consideration all\r\nthat I have stated, I own that the impression on my mind is that there\r\nis not absolute and complete evidence of Smethurst’s guilt.” Thus on\r\nevidence not subjected to the searching cross-examination which it\r\ncould have received if produced at the trial, and the opinion of a most\r\neminent surgeon (not an analyst) merely on reading the papers submitted\r\nto him, the prisoner was pardoned. “The responsibility,” says Judge\r\nStephen, “was thus shifted from those on whom it properly rested on\r\nto a man, who, however skilful and learned as a surgeon, was neither\r\njuryman nor judge.”[184]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIVERPOOL POISONING CASE.\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF THOMAS WINSLOW FOR THE WILFUL MURDER OF ANN JAMES.\r\n\r\n _Before_ BARON MARTIN, NORTHERN CIRCUIT, LIVERPOOL, _August 20, 1860_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n _For the Prosecution_: The Attorney-General for the County Palatine\r\n (Mr. Bliss, Q.C.), Mr. Aspinall, _and_ Mr. Temple.\r\n\r\n _For the Defence_: Mr. Digby Seymour, Q.C. for the County Palatine,\r\n Mr. Fenwick, _and_ Mr. Little.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner, who had been an ironworker, was charged with the murder\r\nof Ann James, by aggravating the disease of the _cæcum_, under which\r\nshe was suffering, through the administration of minute doses of\r\nantimony. Mrs. James came to Liverpool from Devonshire, in 1854,\r\nwhither she was soon followed by her sister Eliza, her sister’s husband\r\na Mr. Townsend, an invalid, three nephews, and a niece, who was married\r\nto a japanner of the name of Cafferata. Commencing business as a\r\ngrocer, she had subsequently kept an eating-house, which was eventually\r\nturned into a night refreshment and registered lodging-house, of which\r\nthe prisoner, one of her lodgers, had taken the active management.\r\nBetween him and the Townsends it was evident that no good feeling\r\nexisted. They were jealous of his influence over their aunt, and\r\nsuspicious of the intimate relations that existed between them. One of\r\nthe nephews, Martin, who had caused her much trouble and expense from\r\nfrequently enlisting in and having to be bought out of the army, acted\r\nas baker to the shop, but, with that exception, the Townsends had no\r\nshare in the business. Previous to the last illness of their aunt, her\r\nsister, lately left a widow, and the other two nephews, died suddenly,\r\nas it was found afterwards, under very suspicious circumstances. No\r\ninvestigation, however, was made in their cases, until after the aunt’s\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nMrs. James had prospered in her business: according to her own account,\r\nthe prisoner had made it. Her stock-in-trade and the goodwill were\r\nworth between £200 and £300: she had four gas shares, valued at £200,\r\nand £130 in the savings bank, at the time of her death. An authority\r\nfor the withdrawal of the money from the savings bank, the holograph of\r\nthe prisoner, was found in a drawer, and during her last illness the\r\nprisoner had gone to the gas company to try and get the shares entered\r\nin his own name, and been told that it could not be done without a\r\nproper transfer, or by will. On this he got the solicitor of the\r\ngas company to see Mrs. James and draw her will. This the solicitor\r\ndid, no one but himself and his clerk being present, and by it the\r\nbusiness and stock-in-trade were left to the prisoner, and the rest\r\nof the property divided equally between Mrs. Cafferata and her child,\r\nand the nephew Martin, the prisoner being appointed sole executor. On\r\nthe 5th of February, Mrs. James was so ill that the prisoner called\r\nin Dr. Cameron, Physician to the Liverpool Southern Hospital, who\r\nfound her in bed, suffering from bowel complaint, and a tumour in the\r\nabdomen, which he believed to be cancer, and very weak and prostrate.\r\nHe prescribed for her, and desired to be sent for again if she became\r\nworse. On the 26th of that month the prisoner wrote to Mrs. Cafferata\r\nat Manchester to come at once if she wished to see her aunt alive.\r\nShe came and stayed with her for a fortnight, sleeping in the same\r\nbed, in the back parlour, of which the prisoner had the key at night.\r\nDuring Mrs. James’s illness her food was prepared by her servants, and\r\nbrought to her room generally at night by the prisoner, who was very\r\nattentive, and showed great interest in her condition. On the 29th of\r\nMarch, Dr. Cameron was sent for again, and found her symptoms similar\r\nto those he had seen on his first visit. Again, on the 8th of May he\r\nsaw her, when she was suffering under a violent attack of purging and\r\nvomiting, but, as regarded these effects, was convalescent by the 19th.\r\nOn the 25th, however, he found her again very ill, and for the first\r\ntime, from the symptoms, suspected that some foreign ingredient, some\r\nirritating substance, such as antimony, had been given to her. Mrs.\r\nCafferata had again been sent for to attend on her aunt. Dr. Cameron\r\nprescribed tannin as an antidote, and on the 6th of June Mrs. James\r\nwas again convalescent. Two days after, however, the same bad symptoms\r\nreappeared, and she became exceedingly prostrate. Some of her urine and\r\nexcretions were obtained and handed to Dr. Edwards for analysis, and\r\nits results communicated to Dr. Cameron, who, in consequence, went to\r\nher house on the 10th of June with the police, took possession of all\r\nthe medicine bottles and some cups that were in her room, and had Mrs.\r\nJames taken to the Southern Hospital. More specimens of the excretions\r\nwere obtained, and instructions given that for the future they should\r\nbe, from time to time, preserved. On the evening of the 9th of June, if\r\nMrs. Cafferata was to be believed, a most suspicious incident occurred.\r\n“On that evening,” she said, “I made my aunt a cup of sago from a\r\nparcel on the kitchen shelf, which she took, and at three o’clock the\r\nnext morning took up to her a cup of tea and an egg, and, as she did\r\nnot eat them, I placed them on a chair by the bedside, went into bed to\r\nher, and slept till nine o’clock, having locked the door, and placed\r\nthe key under it. When I awoke I found my aunt awake, and appearing to\r\nwant to go to sleep. I then saw two cups had been brought into the room\r\nin the night” (the prisoner admitted that he brought one) “and the cup\r\ngone from the bedside.”[185] In one of these cups was a little sago, in\r\nwhich antimony was detected by chemical analysis. For some days after\r\nher removal to the Hospital Mrs. James continued very ill, but ceased\r\nto have attacks of vomiting and purging after the first or second day.\r\nAfterwards, however, she improved in health until the 22nd of June,\r\nwhen dangerous symptoms occurred, and she died in two days.[186]\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL AND ANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Cameron_, who attended the _post-mortem_ examination of the body\r\nof the deceased, gave the following description of the appearances\r\npresented.\r\n\r\n “The body was greatly emaciated. The membrane of the gullet presented\r\n a yellow appearance. At the entrance of the stomach there were two\r\n patches of false membrane, but I could form no opinion how they were\r\n caused. The stomach was distended, and contained sixteen ounces of\r\n fluid. There were two small ulcers communicating with the cancerous\r\n tumour, which might have been caused by the administration of antimony\r\n or by disease. The bowels had been perforated and their contents\r\n discharged into the cavity of the abdomen, which was the immediate\r\n cause of death. My opinion is, that antimony was administered within a\r\n very short time of her admission into the hospital—sometime between\r\n the 9th and 10th of June. I do not think antimony was given to her\r\n after her admission into the hospital. The vomiting was not of the\r\n kind ulcers would produce, but of a kind which might be produced by an\r\n irritating substance such as antimony.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_ by _Mr. Digby Seymour_, he said:—\r\n\r\n “Hot food in a case like that of Mrs. James might produce vomiting,\r\n and always occasioned more or less pain with ulceration of the\r\n stomach. There was no redness of the small intestines. Vomiting was\r\n one of the principal symptoms of ulceration of the stomach, as by\r\n tending to starve and weaken the patient it produced emaciation and\r\n prostration. Purging was not a usual symptom of an ulcerated stomach,\r\n but occurred with cancer in the bowels. Witness agreed with Dr.\r\n Richards as to there being no case in which slow antimonial poisoning\r\n was accompanied with dysenteric evacuations. The alternation of\r\n constipation and purging was one of the known symptoms of antimonial\r\n poisoning. The intermitting condition of the patient was one of the\r\n reasons which led him to the conclusion that she was the subject of\r\n poison. Witness agreed with the opinion that in malignant diseases of\r\n the stomach the symptoms remitted in a remarkable way so as to excite\r\n a hope that recovery would take place; but the truce was not very\r\n long; frightful disorganization was at length produced and inevitable\r\n death at last. Softening of the brain had been noticed in some cases\r\n of antimonial poisoning, but it was not a frequent or even an ordinary\r\n indication. Antimonial poisoning sometimes produced enlargement of\r\n the liver, but it did not in this case. Aphthous ulcerations in the\r\n glands of the small intestines are also symptoms of the presence of\r\n antimony—_there were none in this case_. Eminent writers on _Materia\r\n Medica_ and pathology assert that some persons can tolerate the\r\n presence of poison in their bodies without it having any effect upon\r\n them. It is also an accepted truth among eminent scientific writers,\r\n that there are conditions and circumstances of the human frame in\r\n which antimony may not possess poisonous results.”\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_, the _witness_ said:—\r\n\r\n “This toleration of poison is common in certain cases of inflammation,\r\n but it is my opinion that, in this case, the opposite to toleration\r\n has been established. Aphthous ulcerations are not often observed\r\n in cases of poisoning by antimony. The absence of these symptoms,\r\n combined with the state of the liver and brain, in no way affect my\r\n opinion as to the poisoning in this case. There were peculiar symptoms\r\n in the vomiting of Mrs. James which induce me to believe that it was\r\n not caused by the ulcer. Antimony would aggravate the ulcerous disease\r\n and enfeeble the bodily powers, as well as affect the appetite. One of\r\n the effects of slow poisoning by repeated doses is that the stomach is\r\n prevented from receiving fresh nourishment.”\r\n\r\n _To the Judge._—“I have never attended a human patient poisoned by\r\n antimony. Persons suffering from sickness after food are relieved\r\n by vomiting; but in the case of Mrs. James there was considerable\r\n retching after the food was thrown off the stomach.”\r\n\r\n_John Baker Edwards_, Analytical Chemist, said:—\r\n\r\n “He analysed a bottle of urine which he received from Dr. Cameron\r\n on the 6th of June, and informed him that he found in it slight\r\n traces of antimony. On Saturday, June 9, he received two bottles\r\n from Dr. Cameron, one of which contained fæces, analysed it and\r\n found slight traces of antimony. The other bottle was marked\r\n ‘vomit.’ Analysed that, and found in it two considerable deposits\r\n of antimony. Subsequently confirmed this analysis by other chemical\r\n tests. He sublimed it by the application of heat, and obtained a\r\n white sublimate, which, when examined under the microscope, had the\r\n appearance of oxide of antimony. Afterwards dissolved this in tartaric\r\n acid, passed sulphuretted hydrogen gas through it, and obtained an\r\n orange precipitate—sulphuret of antimony. He could not scientifically\r\n distinguish whether it was ‘free’ or ‘eliminated’ antimony.[187] On\r\n Wednesday, the 13th of June, he received three bottles labelled ‘Mrs.\r\n James, Tuesday,’ one of which was labelled ‘vomit.’ It had scarcely a\r\n trace of antimony. The other two bottles contained fæces and urine,\r\n in each of which was a trace of antimony. On the same day he also\r\n received two cups, one of them containing about a tablespoonful of\r\n sago. This he analysed and found in it two considerable deposits\r\n of antimony on copper, which he sublimed and recognised under the\r\n microscope as oxide of antimony. On Thursday the 14th he received\r\n three bottles, one of them of vomit, containing no antimony; the\r\n other two containing fæces and urine, in which was no antimony. On\r\n the 15th he again received a bottle of vomit and also one of fæces,\r\n and in the former he found two antimonial deposits, which under the\r\n microscope he recognised as oxide of antimony, and in the latter a\r\n trace of antimony. On the following day he found traces of antimony in\r\n two bottles of urine. The day after he received two bottles, one of\r\n urine, and found a trace of antimony in each. He also examined some\r\n uncooked sago which contained no antimony. Subsequently (after Mrs.\r\n James had been removed to the hospital) he received bottles labelled\r\n ‘Mrs. James.’ The vomit contained no antimony, but there were still\r\n distinct traces of it in the fæces and urine. He subsequently received\r\n four jars containing brain, lungs, heart, spleen, kidneys, intestines,\r\n stomach, and blood, labelled ‘Mrs. James,’ and four bottles containing\r\n fluids. He analysed portions of these separately. From one half of the\r\n stomach he obtained five deposits of antimony. He also obtained five\r\n deposits of antimony from the intestines, four deposits of it from one\r\n of the kidneys, and three deposits of it from one half of the liver.\r\n He found no trace in the brain. In four ounces of blood he found a\r\n distinct deposit of antimony, and also from the fluid of the stomach.\r\n He also analysed six bottles of medicine and two of urine, and found\r\n no antimony. On the 26th of July he took a portion of the spleen and\r\n lungs of Mrs. James to London, and examined them there in conjunction\r\n with Dr. Miller and Dr. Taylor, and also the deposits of the viscera.\r\n He examined and tested them and found by the most approved tests\r\n applied that they contained antimony.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, the _witness_ admitted:—\r\n\r\n “That the first satisfactory result which he obtained was on the\r\n 9th of June—that he had no doubt that the trace he found on the\r\n 7th was antimony, but it was not a satisfactory result—that he had\r\n examined the body of a dog which died from antimony, and which had\r\n been exhumed, and had not found a trace, and, that if the animal had\r\n vomited after taking it he should not have expected to find any.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. A. S. Taylor_ said:—\r\n\r\n “That he received some jars at Guy’s Hospital from Inspector Horne,\r\n containing portions of the stomach, cæcum, liver, one kidney, and\r\n the heart, and afterwards from Dr. Edwards a portion of the spleen\r\n and lungs. He divided them and gave a part to Mr. Miller. Dr.\r\n Edwards showed him some sublimate on glass, and deposits on copper.\r\n He examined them. The deposits on copper were metallic antimony, and\r\n those on the glass were oxide of antimony. He was of opinion that\r\n antimony had entered the body during life. Assuming the deceased to\r\n have been labouring under the disease of the cæcum, and to have had\r\n two ulcers in her stomach, the administration to her of antimony, by\r\n depressing the bodily powers, would tend to accelerate death. Antimony\r\n had a powerful depressing influence and lowered the pulse in strength,\r\n produced great exhaustion of the system, and in a serious disease\r\n affecting the body was likely to aggravate its effects. A person might\r\n be able to bear a dose of antimony in health, who in a serious disease\r\n would be destroyed by it. His opinion, in this case, was that antimony\r\n had been administered at intervals in small doses. Antimony could be\r\n found in the tissues three weeks after it was taken. It might during\r\n that time be found, day by day and at intervals, in the secretions.\r\n The tests which he had applied were the most approved known in\r\n science.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, the _witness_ said:—\r\n\r\n “The disease which has been described as affecting the deceased must\r\n have terminated fatally. The death had been caused by inflammation\r\n arising from the passage of the contents of the diseased bowel\r\n into the cavity of the abdomen. It was very difficult to draw the\r\n line where a patient had rallied from the effects of poison, and\r\n where she sank under disease. The medical man in attendance on the\r\n deceased person would be the best judge of the influence of poison in\r\n accelerating death. Small doses frequently repeated would have the\r\n effect of irritating the mucous membrane of the bowels. In two most\r\n marked cases of poisoning with which he bad been connected there had\r\n been no change in the condition of the liver. _All the indications in\r\n Mrs. James’s case were referable to natural causes._ If antimony were\r\n found in the fæces, he should conclude that the purging was occasioned\r\n by antimony. In vomiting caused by ulcers in the stomach, it was\r\n confined to the relief of the stomach from its contents, and then\r\n ceased. Antimony produced prostration of the nervous power.”\r\n\r\n_Dr. Miller_, Professor of Chemistry at King’s College, confirmed the\r\nopinion of Dr. Taylor so far as it related to the chemical analysis,\r\nbut gave no medical opinion.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Clarence Pemberton_, House Surgeon at the Southern Hospital in\r\nLiverpool, deposed that he attended Mrs. James and paid attention\r\nto her symptoms. He made the _post-mortem_ examination. “Taking\r\nthe symptoms observed during lifetime, and the appearances shown\r\nby the _post-mortem_ examination, and assuming the judgment of Dr.\r\nEdwards to be correct, the cause of death, in his judgment, was the\r\ndiseased ‘cæcum,’ but the administration of antimony would undoubtedly\r\naccelerate her death.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, he admitted that, _judging from what he saw in\r\nthe hospital, all the symptoms might be attributed to natural causes_,\r\nand, in answer to the Judge, said that _on the post-mortem examination\r\nhe could find no traces or symptoms which he exclusively attributed to\r\nthe administration of antimony_.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Francis Ayrton_ said he saw the viscera and the other portions\r\nof the deceased sent for analysation. He observed some redness at the\r\ncommencement of the small intestines, and some spots on the large ones,\r\nand he formed his opinion from these spots that an irritant had passed\r\nthrough the bowels. Antimony was an irritant, and would produce such\r\nappearances. He had heard the evidence given, and his opinion was that\r\nthe deceased’s death was accelerated by antimony. He also admitted,\r\non cross-examination, that _what he observed in the viscera might be\r\nattributable to other causes than antimonial poison_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER’S STATEMENTS.\r\n\r\nAccording to the evidence of Mrs. Cafferata, and the inspector of\r\npolice, the prisoner openly accused the Cafferatas of having poisoned\r\ntheir aunt. He objected to their interference, and ordered them to\r\nleave the house, calling Cafferata a second Palmer, because he carried\r\nwhite powders about in his pocket, and saying, when the wife showed\r\nhim the soda powders in question, “You are not likely to show me the\r\nright stuff.” When Mrs. Cafferata wanted to go to the hospital to see\r\nher aunt, he threatened to put her under arrest. That the prisoner\r\nhad a great deal of drink when he spoke in this way was admitted by\r\nthe witness, but when he made the same accusation of the Cafferatas\r\nto the inspector such apparently was not his condition. On the other\r\nhand, a Mrs. Higgins, on cross-examination, spoke to a threat of Mrs.\r\nCafferata’s that “she would hang the orange dog (the prisoner), and\r\nthat after her evidence they would want no more.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF POISON BY THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\nThe proof of the purchase of antimony by the prisoner was most\r\nunsatisfactory. A woman (Ann Foley) who used to work for Mrs. James,\r\nremembered that during the previous summer, on one occasion, when Mrs.\r\nJames was sitting behind the counter and the prisoner was present, she\r\nsaid to him, “Here is Mrs. Foley; she will go for it;” that they then\r\ngave her twopence and told her to go and get antimony for the dog, and\r\nthat when she went to a chemist of the name of Miller for it he would\r\nnot let her have it, but told her to tell them to bring the dog over to\r\nhim. This chemist’s assistant (E. P. Rees) remembered a woman coming\r\nfor antimony some nine or ten months before, a second person coming\r\nalso for it on the same day, and a third about four months after for\r\nthe same drug, to poison a dog with. The third person, he believed,\r\nbut could not swear, was the prisoner. Another witness (Eliza Brennan)\r\ntold a strange story about the prisoner. She had been in Mrs. James’s\r\nservice, some two years ago, and spoke to him about leaving and going\r\nto Dublin in the first week of her service. On this the prisoner, she\r\nsaid, advised her to stay, but added that, “if she would go, if she\r\nwould buy him half-a-crown’s worth of antimony in Dublin, and send it\r\nto him by the boat, he would give her £5.” Lastly, a newspaper boy\r\n(Thomas Maguire), who slept at Mrs. James’s house, swore that\r\n\r\n “The prisoner once sent him for a pennyworth of something for the dog,\r\n he did not know its name, but what he got was a white powder, which\r\n when given to the animal in water purged it violently—that within\r\n half an hour the prisoner sent him again for the same, and now told\r\n him its name was antimony. He got it, said the witness, from a young\r\n man, name Coopland, at Miller’s the chemist. He declared it was taken\r\n from a bottle six or seven from the window, and professed to point out\r\n the bottle to the Inspector of police. He knew that the letters ANT.\r\n on it stood for antimony. He had also several times since January last\r\n seen the prisoner when making bread and butter for the mistress take\r\n from his pocket a white powder in a paper and throw some of it on the\r\n bread before he buttered it; when he asked him once what it was, the\r\n prisoner had said it was salt. When the witness said ‘there was salt\r\n enough in the house without that,’ the prisoner made no reply.”\r\n\r\nTo Inspector Home the prisoner admitted that “he knew the use of\r\nantimony, and had given it to cattle, but had not had any in his\r\npossession for many years.”\r\n\r\nIn his charge to the jury, _Baron Martin_ told them that, if they\r\nbelieved that the prisoner administered the antimony with the intention\r\nof killing, and that her death from a natural disease was thus\r\naccelerated, that was murder—citing the dictum of Lord Hale “that if\r\na man be sick of some disease which might possibly end his life, and\r\nanother gave him a wound, which would hasten his death, this was murder\r\nby the party giving the wound”—they were to guard against prejudice\r\nbecause of the nature of the crime, and not to convict unless the\r\nevidence affirmatively satisfied their minds of his guilt.\r\n\r\nThe jury almost immediately returned a verdict of “Not Guilty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nANTIMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n Properties of the metal—Alloys—Compounds—Chlorides, sulphides,\r\n oxides, hydride. Tartar emetic—solubility, composition, uses\r\n and occurrence—commercial, veterinary, medicinal. Doses\r\n and preparations—fatal dose, fatal period. Physiological\r\n effects—Antidotes—Separations and tests—(1) Reinsch’s—Presence of\r\n antimony; purity of the copper employed, how to be secured; different\r\n stains resulting from presence of arsenic, antimony, mercury, bismuth,\r\n tin, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, sulphur compounds—(2) Dr.\r\n Maclagan’s test in Pritchard’s trial—(3) Marsh’s test—Remarks\r\n on Pritchard’s trial—On Smethurst’s trial—Dr. Taylor and Mr.\r\n Herapath—Arsenic in bismuth—Antimony in grey powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIMONY.\r\n\r\nTHE metal antimony (symbol Sb, from its classical name _Stibium_)\r\nis heavier than arsenic (sp. gr. 6·8), less easily tarnished, more\r\ndifficult to pulverize, and not nearly so volatile. It forms somewhat\r\nbrittle masses, with a fern-like crystalline appearance on the surface.\r\nWhen broken the interior shows radiating (rhombohedral) crystals of a\r\nbluish-white, strongly metallic lustre (arsenicum is greyish, bismuth\r\nis pinkish, white), yielding a grey or black powder. Melting point,\r\n425° C. Heated with the blowpipe on charcoal it gives white fumes of\r\noxide, _without odour_ (arsenic gives a garlic odour). The metal is\r\ninsoluble in water and dilute acids, but soluble in _aqua regia_ to\r\nform antimonious chloride; also soluble in sulphide of potassium or\r\nsodium. Hot concent. sulphuric acid converts it into sulphate. Nitric\r\nacid turns it into a white powder consisting chiefly of _metantimonic\r\nacid_, HSbO_{3}, of which a small quantity dissolves.[188] The\r\npowdered metal burns in chlorine, forming Sb Cl_{3}, or Sb Cl_{5}.\r\nMetallic antimony is obtained as a “mirror” in Marsh’s test: the\r\ndistinctions between it and arsenic have been already given (p. 389).\r\n\r\nThe following is the percentage of metallic antimony in different\r\nalloys. English type metal, 20 to 25; German ditto, 15; Britannia\r\nmetal, 10 to 16; pewter, 7; Argentine, 14½; Ashbury metal, 19½; white\r\nor anti-friction metal for engine-bearings, 10; Babbit’s metal, for\r\nsimilar purposes, 13; alloy for ships’ nails, 17 (Ure’s Dictionary, I.,\r\n169; Roscoe and Schorlemmer’s Chemistry, 1880, ii., 2, p. 307). There\r\nis also antimony in brass, metallic mirrors, bell-metal, &c. (Blyth).\r\n_Antimony black_, used for giving a steel-like lustre to plaster casts,\r\nis finely divided Sb, precipitated from the chloride by zinc.\r\n\r\nMetallic antimony is not poisonous unless partially oxidized.\r\nCommercial samples usually contain a little arsenic, which enters into\r\nthe salts.\r\n\r\n_Antimonious chloride_, Sb Cl_{3}, when pure, forms colourless\r\nglistening deliquescent crystals. A solution in hydrochloric acid\r\nconstitutes the commercial “butter of antimony” used for giving a dark\r\nbronzing to brass. It is a thick, powerfully acid liquid, coloured\r\nbrown by the presence of iron, fuming in air, very corrosive, and\r\nof an irritating odour, distilling over at about 200° C. (_pure_ Sb\r\nCl_{3} boils at 223° C.), decomposed by water into a white magma of\r\n_oxychloride_, Sb O Cl, “powder of Algaroth” (tartar emetic is not\r\ndecomposed by water). It is a violent corrosive poison, blackening and\r\ndestroying the surfaces like oil of vitriol. For cases, _see_ Woodman\r\nand Tidy, p. 130.\r\n\r\n_Antimonic chloride_, Sb Cl_{5}, is rarely met with. It resembles Sb\r\nCl_{3}, but is liquid.\r\n\r\n_Antimonious sulphide_, Sb_{2} S_{3}, is found native as “stibnite,”\r\n“speiss-glas,” “grey antimony,” or “antimony glance,” sp. gr. 4·63, in\r\nlead-grey striated prisms, fibrous or massive, of a strong metallic\r\nlustre, fusing readily to a dark-brown glass —“vitrum antimonii”),\r\ngiving before the blowpipe white fumes, and an odour of sulphur\r\ndioxide —“brimstone”). It is the principal ore, the source of all the\r\npreparations, and is itself used in fireworks. When powdered it is\r\nblack, and in this state was used by the Roman ladies under the name of\r\n“stibium,” by the Orientals as “Kohl,” for darkening the eyelids. It\r\nis soluble in hot hydrochloric acid to form SbCl_{3}. The precipitated\r\nsulphide is orange, and will be noticed under the tests. Sb_{2} S_{3}\r\nwould not be poisonous until oxidized.\r\n\r\n_Antimonious oxide_, Sb_{2} O_{3}, obtained by burning Sb in air, is a\r\nwhite powder, turned yellow on heating, soluble in hydrochloric acid to\r\nform Sb Cl_{3}, and in cream of tartar (acid potass. tartrate) to form\r\n_tartar emetic_. Unlike As_{2} O_{3}, it does not easily volatilize in\r\ncrystals. It is occasionally found native.\r\n\r\n_Antimonic oxide_, Sb_{2} O_{5}, is a pale yellow powder. There is also\r\nan intermediate oxide, Sb_{2} O_{4}.\r\n\r\n_Antimonious and antimonic acids_ are hydrates of the above oxides.\r\nThey exist in several modifications, and form metallic salts, one of\r\nwhich, sodium pyrantimonate, Na_{2} H_{2} Sb_{2} O_{7}, 6 H_{2} O, is\r\nthe only known insoluble salt of sodium, and hence available as a test.\r\n\r\n_Antimonious hydride_, Stibine, or “antimoniuretted hydrogen,” Sb\r\nH_{3}, has never been obtained pure. In admixture with hydrogen,\r\nas given by Marsh’s test, it is a colourless gas, almost or quite\r\n_inodorous_ (distinction from As H_{3} which smells like garlic),\r\ndecomposed by heat into hydrogen and a “mirror” of Sb. Its poisonous\r\nproperties have been doubted, but it is probably more dangerous than\r\nAs H_{3}, on account of the absence of the warning odour. It burns\r\nwith a bluish-green flame, giving white clouds of Sb_{2} O_{3}, and a\r\nspot of Sb, duller and greyer than As, when a cold porcelain surface\r\nis depressed into the flame. Passed into silver nitrate solution, the\r\nSb is precipitated along with metallic silver as _silver antimonide_,\r\nAg_{3} Sb, whereas arsenic under the same circumstances would remain in\r\nsolution as As_{2} O_{3}.\r\n\r\n\r\nTARTAR EMETIC.\r\n\r\n_Potassio-antimonyl tartrate_, _tartrate of antimony and potash_,\r\n“_antimonium tartarizatum_,” “_tartarized antimony_,” “_stibiated\r\ntartar_,” symbol K (Sb O) C_{4} H_{4} O_{6}, ½ H_{2} O, occurs in\r\ncolourless rhombic octahedral crystals, transparent at first, but\r\nbecoming opaque by efflorescence, or as a white powder, inodorous, and\r\nwith a strong metallic taste. The aqueous solution is faintly acid to\r\ntest-paper, and becomes mouldy on keeping. When evaporated on a glass\r\nslide, it leaves a crystalline residue of _tetrahedra_, cubes and\r\nbranching forms. (_See_ figure in Guy and Ferrier’s For. Med., p. 469.)\r\nHeated on platinum, tartar emetic blackens and swells up with an odour\r\nof burnt sugar (due to the tartaric acid), gives a bluish-green tint\r\nto the flame, and quickly fuses and makes a hole in the platinum, from\r\nthe formation of a fusible alloy. Heated in a closed tube, it gives\r\ncharcoal, potass. carbonate, and metallic antimony, which does not\r\nsublime at a moderate temperature, is inodorous, and may be separated\r\nin metallic globules by washing (differences from arsenic; _see_ p.\r\n389). Sulph. hydrogen of course gives the orange-red sulphide.\r\n\r\n_Solubility._—Tartar emetic is almost insoluble in alcohol, and still\r\nless soluble in ether, chloroform, &c. Spirits and water, such as\r\nare mixed for drinking, dissolve nearly as much as cold water, and\r\nmore if warm. The solubility in cold water is given very variously in\r\nthe text-books, from 1 part in 21·8 —“20 grains per fluid ounce,”\r\nBritish Pharmacopœia), 1 in 20 (Garrod and Blyth), 1 in 15 (Brande’s\r\nand Gmelin’s Chemistry), to 1 in 14 (Graham and Taylor). To clear up\r\nthis difficulty I prepared for Dr. Bernays in 1879 a very pure sample\r\nof the salt: he found that 100 cubic centimetres of water at 58° F.\r\ndissolved 6·67 grammes, equal to _one part in fifteen_. The solubility\r\nrises rapidly with the temperature, till it reaches _one part in two_\r\nat the boiling point. The discrepancies are accounted for by the facts\r\nthat, (1), the textbooks do not mention the temperature; (2), the salt\r\nreadily effloresces in air, losing water and becoming less soluble;\r\n(3), impurities are often present.\r\n\r\n_Composition._—Commercial tartar emetic is generally very pure. It\r\nsometimes contains a trace of sand and dirt, occasionally an excess of\r\ncream of tartar (potass. hydrogen tartrate) from careless preparation,\r\nbut I have never found arsenic. The theoretical percentage of Sb is\r\n36·53: in good commercial samples Bernays found 36·03 to 36·32 per\r\ncent.; in an over-dried specimen, 37·4 per cent. One sample contained\r\n23 per cent. of cream of tartar and only 28·13 of Sb; another, 10 per\r\ncent. tartar and 32·7 of Sb.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES AND OCCURRENCE.\r\n\r\nThe alloys and pyrotechnic uses have been already mentioned. The impure\r\nfused sulphide (vitrum antimonii) is employed to give a yellow tint to\r\nglass and porcelain. The oxides are used in glazing earthenware, and\r\nin glass and china painting. The following are antimonial pigments:\r\n“Antimony cinnabar,” and “crocus,” or “saffron of antimony,” are\r\noxysulphides: “Naples,” “Cassell,” and “antimony yellows,” are chiefly\r\nantimoniates of lead. Small quantities of antimony occur in iron ores,\r\nferruginous waters, the coal formation, and in river sand (Roscoe).\r\n\r\nIn _veterinary practice_, large doses of antimonials are given to\r\nanimals, as much as 90 grains of tartar emetic being often administered\r\nto a horse in his gruel three times a day. Other preparations are used\r\n(_see_ Blyth’s Pract. Chem. 1879, p. 404). They are supposed to cause\r\nfattening.\r\n\r\n_Medicinally_ it is employed in typhus, _delirium tremens_, small\r\ndoses in croup and the broncho-pneumonia of children, as a general\r\nexpectorant in asthma and bronchitis, in whooping-cough, by some\r\nrecommended also in scaly skin affections. In acute inflammations\r\nand pneumonia, it has lost favour, as too depressing (Farquharson’s\r\nTherapeutics). In times before chloroform, tartar emetic was even used\r\nto lower the muscular tension previous to reducing dislocations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOSES AND PREPARATIONS.\r\n\r\n_Pulvis antimonialis_, 3 to 10 grains. This is the Pharmacopœial\r\nequivalent of “James’s Powder,” a secret remedy once highly popular. It\r\ncontains one part of Sb_{2} O_{3} to two of phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n_Vinum antimoniale_, antimonial wine, is a solution of 10 grains of\r\ntartar emetic to each ounce of sherry: dose, 5 minims to 1 fluid drachm.\r\n\r\n_Antimonii oxidum_, Sb_{2} O_{3}, is often very impure. It may\r\ncontain, (1), higher oxides of Sb, when it is not completely soluble\r\non boiling with water and cream of tartar; (2), carbonate of lime,\r\nwhen it effervesces with acids and contains less Sb; (3), traces of\r\narsenic, when it gives a garlic odour before the blowpipe on charcoal.\r\nPercentage of Sb, 83·56: dose, 1 to 4 grains.\r\n\r\n_Antimonium sulphuratum_, or _oxysulphuretum_, is precipitated Sb_{2}\r\nS_{3} with a small amount of Sb_{2} O_{3}. It contains about 62 to\r\n65 per cent. Sb (pure Sb_{2} S_{3} has 70·2 per cent.). Dose, 1 to 5\r\ngrains, but rarely prescribed, except in “compound calomel pill,” _pil.\r\nhydrarg. subchlorid. co._, which contains 20 per cent. of Sb_{2} S_{3}.\r\n\r\n_Antimonii chloridi liquor_, a solution of Sb Cl_{3} in hydrochloric\r\nacid, is sometimes used as a caustic, never internally.\r\n\r\n_Antimonium tartaratum_, tartar emetic: dose, as a diaphoretic, 1/16\r\nto ⅙ grain; as a depressant, ⅙ to 1 grain; as an emetic, 1 to 2 grains\r\n(to 3 grains, Farquharson). It should never be used as an emetic in\r\nsuspected poisoning, as its presence would confuse the investigation.\r\n\r\n_Unguentum antimonii tartarati_, antimonial ointment, contains 20 per\r\ncent. of tartar emetic.\r\n\r\nThe following proprietary pills contain tartar emetic in the annexed\r\nproportion per pill weighing about 3 grains:—_Dr. J. Johnson’s_, 0·04\r\ngrain; _Mitchell’s_, 0·05 grain: _Dixon’s_, 0·06 grain (Blyth).\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the liqueur _absinthe_ owes its deleterious\r\neffects to antimony. I have tested several specimens, but never found\r\nantimony, though traces of lead or copper were occasionally present.\r\n\r\n_Fatal dose._—About this, nothing can be exactly stated. The smallest\r\nwas, in a child, ¾ grain; in an adult, 2 grains; but in this instance\r\nthere were circumstances which favoured the fatal operation (Taylor,\r\nMed. Jur. i., 310).\r\n\r\nIf vomiting and purging happen, the poison is for the most part\r\nexpelled: except for the effects of exhaustion, there may then be\r\nhardly a limit to the amount which may pass in and pass out. Taylor\r\nrecords recoveries from 120 grains, 200 grains, and even _half an\r\nounce_ of tartar emetic. In pneumonia it has been given in repeated\r\ndoses of 2 grains without ill effects. It must be remembered that, in\r\nthe hands of the poisoner, its perverted use is, not to kill, but to so\r\nweaken the vital powers that a small and not suspicious dose of some\r\nother poison may complete the death.\r\n\r\n_Fatal period._—Shortest, seven hours in an adult female (Wormley);\r\neight hours in a boy after 10 grains tartar emetic (Lancet, 1846, p.\r\n460). Usually much longer: four days after 40 grains (Orfila, i., 480);\r\nup to one year from after effects (Guy and Ferrier).\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant metallic taste, the heat in the throat, and burning in\r\nthe stomach, have been described in the previously reported trials,\r\nand in other cases. Afterwards there is nausea, severe vomiting,\r\nprofuse watery purging, often convulsions which are sometimes tetanic\r\nin character; the skin is generally cold and clammy with perspiration;\r\nthere is collapse from exhaustion, and occasionally delirium and\r\ninsensibility. Death may happen either during the convulsions, or\r\nduring the collapse. The heat and constriction in the throat is not\r\ninvariably present.\r\n\r\nAfter death there is generally found inflammation of the stomach and\r\nintestines, especially the cæcum: the brain is sometimes congested,\r\nthe throat rarely affected. The stomach-contents are usually tinged\r\nwith blood, as with most irritant poisons.\r\n\r\nIn smaller doses it acts at first as a sedative on the brain; the\r\naction of the heart becomes slower, weaker, and finally irregular,\r\nthe pulse is soft, the breathing slower; there is an increased\r\nbronchial secretion, and general muscular relaxation. As an emetic\r\nit is sluggish and depressing, and is often followed by diarrhœa. It\r\npowerfully promotes perspiration, and is therefore used in influenza,\r\n&c. Poisonous doses may cause paralysis, prostration, degeneration of\r\nthe liver and other organs (_see_ Taylor’s remark about the geese at\r\nStrasburg, p. 464), inflammation and even ulceration of the intestines\r\n(Farquharson and others).\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIDOTES.\r\n\r\nSometimes vomiting does not occur: in this case it should be promoted\r\nby tickling the throat, and by draughts of warm water. _Tannin_\r\nprecipitates compounds of antimonious oxide (Sb_{2} O_{3}), but not\r\nthose of antimonic oxide (Sb_{2} O_{5}): as the former are the ones\r\nalmost invariably used, astringent preparations, such as strong\r\ntea, coffee, decoction of oak bark, galls, tincture of catechu or\r\nkino, should be given. Tannin, or tannic acid, is commonly kept by\r\nphotographers. Failing this, sodium carbonate (washing soda), in not\r\ntoo strong solution, may do good. Opium to allay the irritation, and\r\nbrandy to overcome the depression, should then be tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION AND TESTS.\r\n\r\nDuring life, antimony may be found in the urine and fæces: after death,\r\nif its administration has been long continued, it will be found in all\r\nparts of the body, but especially in the _liver and spleen_. If the\r\ndoses have been discontinued some time before death, none may be left\r\nin the stomach and intestines.\r\n\r\nThe enquiry divides itself into three parts: 1st, the _presence_ of\r\nantimony; 2nd, the preparation used; 3rd, the quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PRESENCE OF ANTIMONY.\r\n\r\nMarsh’s and Reinsch’s tests have been mentioned under arsenic. It,\r\nhowever, will be necessary to add a few observations on their special\r\nuse for Sb.\r\n\r\nA fractional part, say one-fourth, of the suspected matter, after\r\nmincing or pounding, is digested with hot distilled water containing\r\n5 per cent. of _pure_ hydrochloric, and a little tartaric, acids,\r\nwell shaken or stirred in a covered or closed vessel, and after some\r\nhours filtered. To a portion of the filtrate is added a little more\r\nhydrochloric and a little sulphuric acid (to reduce the higher oxides\r\nof As and Sb), and the whole is boiled for ten minutes. A portion of\r\nthe filtrate is now subjected to\r\n\r\n_Reinsch’s Test._—First it is absolutely necessary to have _pure\r\ncopper_; so pure, in fact, that a quantity, _larger than would be used\r\nin testing_, will not, _if totally dissolved up_, yield any As or Sb to\r\nanother piece of copper boiled in the solution.\r\n\r\nDr. Taylor’s mistake in the case of Smethurst, more fully treated of\r\nhereafter, was a very natural one. The trace of arsenic in his copper\r\nwould not have affected the conclusion in ordinary cases: but it would\r\nbe better not to test at all than to use materials which are not\r\n_proved beforehand_ to be free from the poison we are seeking. Pure\r\n“electrotype” copper can now be purchased; or it can be made pure by\r\neither of the following methods.\r\n\r\n(_a_) “Pure” commercial sulphate of copper is boiled with a slight\r\nexcess of chlorine water, then treated with dilute ammonia till a\r\nslight permanent precipitate forms: after standing twelve hours it is\r\nfiltered (the precipitate containing iron and arsenic), acidulated with\r\n_pure_ sulphuric acid, and subjected to the current from two Daniell\r\ncells, the terminals being two plates of hard wax well coated with\r\npurified graphite: the coating must communicate with the copperwire\r\nfrom the battery, and the wire must not dip into the solution. The\r\ndistance between the terminals should be so regulated that the copper\r\nmay be deposited _slowly_ and in a tough layer on the negative pole:\r\nthe thin plate so obtained may afterwards be easily detached, hammered\r\nor rolled, and cut into suitable pieces: it is absolutely free from\r\narsenic.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Pure crystallized chloride of copper is mixed with pure carbonate\r\nof soda in excess, the mixture dried with constant stirring, heated to\r\nnear redness, powdered, mixed with an equal volume of lamp-black, and\r\nintroduced into a “plumbago” crucible lined with a paste of purified\r\ngraphite and oil. The crucible is covered, and gradually heated in\r\na Fletcher’s or Griffin’s gas furnace (not with coal or coke), and\r\nfinally kept at a very high temperature till the copper is reduced.\r\nThe fumes contain chlorides of copper, sodium, &c., and are poisonous.\r\nThe copper, after separation from the slag, may be cast, hammered, or\r\nrolled, and is free from As or Sb.\r\n\r\nI suggest these processes more for manufacturers than for chemists, but\r\nexpense and trouble should really be subordinate considerations where\r\nlife is concerned.\r\n\r\nNow for the application. Two flasks containing pure diluted (25 per\r\ncent.) hydrochloric acid are placed on a sandbath, and nearly closed\r\nby small glass funnels. About a square inch of pure copper, cleaned by\r\nsand-paper, is placed in each: to one is added the suspected liquid,\r\nto the other an equal bulk of 5 per cent. hydrochloric acid. Both are\r\nboiled, with occasional inspection. If the following are present, the\r\ncopper will be darkened:—\r\n\r\n_Arsenic._—Stain _steel-grey_: dried and heated in closed tube it\r\ngives _easily_ a sublimate of octahedral crystals of As_{2} O_{3}.\r\n(_See_ Arsenic, _ante_.)\r\n\r\n_Antimony._—Stain black, or in small quantity, _violet_: in the closed\r\ntube it gives with difficulty an _amorphous_ white sublimate of Sb_{2}\r\nO_{3}, soluble in H Cl, and then precipitated _orange_ by H_{2} S.\r\n\r\n_Mercury._—Stain silvery: in closed tube gives a sublimate of\r\n_metallic globules_, made more visible by rubbing them together with a\r\nsplinter of wood.\r\n\r\n_Bismuth_, _tin_, _silver_, _gold_, _platinum_, _palladium_, &c., give\r\nblack, grey or silvery deposits, but no _sublimate_ in the tube. _Gold_\r\ngives a stain which is _yellow_ on burnishing, and yields no sublimate.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur compounds_ in the organic matter may give a dull stain, which\r\nmay even yield a kind of sublimate in the tube, but this sublimate will\r\nnot conform to the tests for As or Sb.\r\n\r\nIf there is much As or Sb, the deposit sometimes peels off if boiled\r\ntoo long.\r\n\r\nThe process used by Prof. Maclagan in the Pritchard trial is also a\r\ngood means of verification. Boil the stained foil in a solution of\r\ncaustic potash, exposing it occasionally to the air (or boil with\r\na weak, slightly alkaline solution of potass, permanganate, and\r\nfilter—Odling). The Sb will be oxidized and dissolved. Add HCl and\r\npass H_{2} S: an orange precipitate of Sb_{2} S_{3} will prove the\r\npresence of antimony.\r\n\r\nIf Sb has been found, remove the first piece of copper, and boil with\r\nanother piece, and so on till the Sb is all removed. The coated slips,\r\nthe sublimate, the Sb_{2} S_{3}, and the copper in the second flask\r\nwhich has still remained bright, should be sealed up to be shown in\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nThe previous treatment with sulphurous acid prevents any interference\r\nby oxidizing agents such as chlorate of potash, nitrates, iodine, &c.\r\n\r\n_Marsh’s Test_ is more delicate, but more liable to error, than\r\nReinsch’s.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of applying Marsh’s test to antimony may be used.\r\n\r\nA. By Edmund Davy’s process with sodium amalgam (_see_ Arsenic, p.\r\n388), only As H_{3} passes off, the Sb remaining behind. Hence, when\r\nthe arsenic has finished coming over, if the remaining solution be\r\nacidulated with _pure_ sulphuric acid,[189] _pure_ zinc put in, and\r\none or two drops of _pure_ platinic chloride added to facilitate the\r\nevolution of hydrogen, the antimony will then come over as Sb H_{3}.\r\n\r\nB. Or the original substance may be placed in the flask, treated at\r\nonce with the zinc and dilute acid, and the As H_{3} and Sb H_{3}\r\npassed together into silver nitrate solution, and separated by\r\nfiltration as directed under arsenic. _See_ p. 389, also as to the\r\ndistinctions between the stains of Sb and As. To these add, that\r\nmetallic spots of both As and Sb are soluble in yellow ammonium\r\nsulphide: the solutions on evaporation to dryness on the water-bath\r\ngive:\r\n\r\n(_a_). With _arsenic_ a _yellow_ stain, soluble in ammonia, insoluble\r\nin hydrochloric acid;\r\n\r\n(_b_). With _antimony_ an _orange_ stain, insoluble in ammonia, soluble\r\nin hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Metallic antimony_ can be precipitated as a black powder from its\r\nsolutions by acidulating with hydrochloric acid and treating with\r\na slip of pure tin, which does not precipitate arsenic. Zinc or\r\nelectrolysis also precipitate Sb, along with copper and many other\r\nmetals. Hence this method is not available in mixtures.\r\n\r\n_Sulphuretted hydrogen_ gives with antimonial solutions slightly\r\nacidulated an orange-red precipitate of sulphide, insoluble in ammonia\r\nor ammonium carbonate, soluble in ammonium sulphide, soluble in hot\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid by conversion into antimonious chloride, and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen: the former then gives a white precipitate with\r\nwater, the latter gives the characteristic odour and blackens lead\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe reactions with sodium hydrate and sodium carbonate, are not so\r\nclear or decisive. Potass. ferrocyanide gives no precipitate. Tannin\r\nand tincture of galls give a yellowish white precipitate. Before the\r\nblowpipe with sodium carbonate on charcoal, solid Sb compounds give a\r\ngrey brittle globule of the metal and a white incrustation. But there\r\nis rarely sufficient for such a test to be of use in toxicological\r\nwork, there is also a risk of loss, and other metals give a similar\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n _N.B._—_Among other substances, sulphide of antimony is frequently\r\n added to caoutchouc in the process of vulcanising india-rubber: in all\r\n toxicological experiments involving tests for antimony (and arsenic),\r\n great danger of a mistake is thus attendant on the use of ordinary\r\n vulcanised india-rubber tubing. Black unvulcanised tubing should alone\r\n be employed._\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PREPARATION USED.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble compounds would act very slowly as poisons and would\r\nrequire very large doses, hence would be found in the solid form in the\r\nstomach, and could be identified by appearance, by the microscope, and\r\nby the tests, after washing and settling down.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain whether antimony was _in solution_, the liquid contents of\r\nthe stomach, after dilution with water if necessary, should be allowed\r\nto settle, the nearly clear top layer decanted and filtered, and the\r\nfiltrate examined. The soluble compounds are:—\r\n\r\n1. _Tartar emetic._ Solution _slightly acid_, taste metallic. On\r\nevaporation on a glass slide _tetrahedral crystals_ are obtained. If\r\nthe solution is moderately strong, it gives a white precipitate with a\r\nlittle hydrochloric acid, soluble in excess: with water it gives _no\r\nprecipitate_. Stomach generally inflamed but not corroded.\r\n\r\n2. _Antimonious chloride_, Sb Cl_{3}. Solution _strongly acid_,\r\neffervescing and giving a white precipitate with sodium carbonate.\r\nTaste corrosive and powerfully metallic. On evaporation, no tetrahedra.\r\nNo precipitate with hydrochloric acid: with water a white precipitate,\r\nre-dissolved by tartaric acid.[190] By analysis a large quantity of\r\n_chlorine_ will be found. The stomach is corroded and often blackened\r\nor charred.\r\n\r\n3. _Antimonates_, _antimonites_, _sulphantimonites_, and _-ates_\r\n(such as “Schlippe’s salt”), are rare and improbable. Antimonates\r\nare _alkaline_, give a white precipitate with acids, and a white\r\ncrystalline one with sodium salts. Schlippe’s salt is strongly\r\nalkaline, and gives with hydrochloric acid an orange-red precipitate of\r\nsulphide.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. QUANTITY.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the amount of Sb is absolutely necessary. Marsh’s test is\r\nnot available, since a large part of the antimony is thrown down on the\r\nzinc and remains in the generating flask. It has been proposed to wash\r\nthis off and weigh it, but other metals and impurities are present,\r\nso that this is not practicable. Reinsch’s test has been applied\r\nquantitatively by weighing the copper before and after the test: the\r\ndifference of weight was supposed to be the As or Sb. But the copper\r\nmay dissolve or oxidise, sulphur and other things deposit on it; so\r\nthat this method is not correct.\r\n\r\nIf antimony only is present, acidulate with hydrochloric acid, pass\r\nsulph. hydrogen in excess, warm, filter, wash the orange hydrated\r\nantimonious sulphide into a porcelain capsule, remove most of the\r\nwater, dry on the water bath, finally at 200°C. and weigh. 100 grains\r\nof Sb_{2} S_{3} correspond to 85·88 of Sb_{2} O_{3}, to 196·47 of\r\ntartar emetic, to 71·76 of Sb, to 134·41 of Sb Cl_{3}.\r\n\r\nBut in the stomach any other metal may be present, hence a process of\r\nseparation must be used. It is not generally necessary to destroy the\r\norganic matter: if this be desired, Fresenius and v. Babo’s process,\r\nof heating with H Cl and potass. chlorate (previously proved pure) may\r\nbe used without much danger of loss, as Sb Cl_{3} is not so volatile\r\nas As Cl_{3}. Otherwise the solution made by pure hydrochloric and\r\na little tartaric acids is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen. The\r\nprecipitated sulphide may be of uncertain, though suspicious colour.\r\nAfter collection on a filter and washing, it should be extracted with\r\ndilute ammon. carbonate solution (10 per cent.): _arsenic_ only will\r\ndissolve and will be reprecipitated as sulphide on adding an acid. The\r\nremainder on the filter must be treated with freshly prepared ammon.\r\nsulphide: _antimony_ and _tin_ will dissolve. If any black residue\r\nremains on the filter, it will consist of _mercury_, _lead_, _bismuth_,\r\nor _copper_: it should be treated with hot 25 per cent. nitric acid,\r\nwhen all will dissolve except _mercuric sulphide_. We shall then have\r\nthree portions:—\r\n\r\n1st. The _mercuric sulphide_. Wash, dry, and weigh. Then heat in\r\na sealed tube with dry sodium carbonate, collect the sublimate of\r\nmetallic mercury, weigh it, and preserve in a sealed tube.\r\n\r\n2nd. The nitric acid solution containing _lead_, _bismuth_, and\r\n_copper_. Evaporate nearly to dryness, dilute, add dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, and a little alcohol, after standing collect and weigh the\r\nprecipitated sulphate of _lead_. Precipitate the _bismuth_ by ammon.\r\ncarbonate in excess, and the _copper_ from the filtrate by zinc or by\r\nsulph. hydrogen. (_See_ Fresenius’ Quant. Anal. p. 411).\r\n\r\n3rd. The ammon. sulphide solution of the _antimony_ and _tin_.\r\nEvaporate to dryness, dissolve in hot strong hydrochloric acid, dilute,\r\ndivide into two equal portions: in _one_ throw down both metals by a\r\nrod of _zinc_: in the other throw down only Sb by a slip of _tin_. Wash\r\noff both precipitates, dry and weigh. The first is antimony and tin\r\ntogether, the second is antimony alone (Gay Lussac). The difference is\r\nthe tin.\r\n\r\nUsually only _some_ of these metals will be present. _Tin_ has derived\r\nmore importance lately since Hehner has proved its almost constant\r\npresence in canned provisions.\r\n\r\nAs to the delicacy of the precipitation of antimony by zinc or\r\ngalvanism, Mohr (Toxicologie, 1876) states that a solution containing\r\n·00005 gramme of Sb in one cub. centimetre gives a distinct reaction in\r\nfifteen minutes. Such a solution gives with H_{2}S only a colouration,\r\nand after a long time a faint precipitate. 1/30000 part gives with zinc\r\na clear reaction in one half-hour: with H_{2} S, only a colour, no\r\nprecipitate, in twelve hours. 1/40000, doubtful: 1/50000, imperceptible\r\nwith zinc: of course, nothing with H_{2} S. The reaction is only\r\ndecisive if other metals are excluded.\r\n\r\nFrom the solution of Sb Cl_{3}, or tartar emetic in H Cl, _gallic acid_\r\nthrows down Sb, and not As or tin. The precipitate after washing and\r\ndrying contains 40·85 per cent. of Sb. (Chem. News, XXIV. 207, 251.)\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the decisive characters of antimony are:—\r\n\r\n1. An orange red precip. by H_{2} S in slightly acid solutions.\r\n\r\n2. The insolubility of this precip. in ammon. carbonate.\r\n\r\n3. Its solubility in ammonium sulphide.\r\n\r\n4. Its solubility in hot H Cl, with evolution of H_{2} S, and formation\r\nof a solution of Sb Cl_{3}, which is precipitated by water and cleared\r\nup again by tartaric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nDR. PRITCHARD’S CASE.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the supposed administration of tartar emetic on a\r\npiece of cheese, in Dr. Pritchard’s trial (_see_ Mr. Clark’s review\r\nof McCleod’s evidence, p. 438), the following considerations are of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n1. An exceedingly small (weighed) quantity of dry powdered tartar\r\nemetic was sprinkled on the surface of a little piece of cheese:\r\nalthough the amount of tartar emetic used was far less than that\r\nrequired to induce vomiting, &c., the powder was found to be plainly\r\nvisible, and the appearance of the cheese so treated would certainly\r\nhave excited suspicion in the mind of any ordinarily observant\r\nperson. Hence it is impossible that enough tartar emetic to produce\r\nthe recorded effects should have been sprinkled externally on the\r\nvery small amounts of cheese described —“not larger than a bean”—M.\r\nMcCleod: “size of a good large pea”—M. Patterson).[191]\r\n\r\n2. With reference to the Lord Justice Clerk’s observation, p. 439,\r\n_note_, tartar emetic is _not_ easily dissolved, a cold saturated\r\naqueous solution containing only 5 per cent. of the salt (according to\r\nthe B. P., 20 grains dissolve without residue in 1 ounce of water). A\r\npiece of cheese, the size of a bean, would weigh about ⅛ ounce. I have\r\nfound by experiment that 1 ounce cheese took up by soaking not more\r\nthan ¼ ounce water, which, from the above, could contain in solution\r\n5 grains of tartar emetic. Hence a piece of cheese, the size of a bean,\r\n= ¼ × ⅛ = 1/32 ounce water = ⅝ grain of tartar emetic. This amount\r\ncould not cause the symptoms described.\r\n\r\n3. If put on in powder the poisonous salt could only be concealed\r\nby being rubbed over with butter or oil: if soaked in a solution of\r\ntartar emetic, the cheese, in order to avert suspicion, must be wiped\r\nor dried—operations practically impossible at the table with so many\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nTwo possibilities remain: (_a_) Cheese is often eaten with salt. Dr.\r\nPritchard may have had a little salt-cellar by his side, professedly\r\nfor his own use, containing tartar emetic, either alone or mixed with\r\nsalt. He may have placed a spoonful of this on the plate with the\r\ncheese: the latter may have been either dipped into the salt or got\r\ninto it accidentally. No question was asked at the trial about such\r\na likely fact, which would account for one person suffering, and not\r\nanother, according as they got the salt or not. The strong taste of\r\nsalt would avert suspicion from that of tartar emetic. (_b_) McCleod\r\nsaid that it was “new cheese—they had it in the house—it was soft—it\r\ntasted hot like pepper.” It is possible, but not easy, by warming and\r\npounding in a mortar, to mix cheese with a considerable amount of a\r\npowder: it would then look _soft_ and rather unnatural, but might, as\r\n“new cheese,” escape suspicion. This theory is less probable than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n_Tapioca._—Mr. Clark’s remark, p. 438, “Now the suggestion of the\r\nCrown is that the prisoner put antimony in this tapioca, so nicely\r\nadjusted as to produce sickness leading to death, but not so as to\r\nproduce death itself,” is inconclusive, as it requires a considerable\r\namount to produce _death_. A large quantity of tartar emetic could be\r\nmixed with tapioca without suspicion, and would not betray itself by\r\nany peculiar appearance on cooking. The same remark applies to the\r\nsago in Winslow’s case.\r\n\r\n_Egg-flip._—“The amount of antimony introduced on the sugar into the\r\negg-flip must have been a very powerful dose, because Patterson took\r\nonly a teaspoonful and lay vomiting and suffering all night.” The total\r\namount was a tumblerful (= 10 fluid ounces). Mrs. Pritchard took a\r\nwine-glassful (= 2 fluid ounces); was sick very soon and all night.\r\nMary Patterson took a teaspoonful, was sick immediately, and vomited\r\nfrequently throughout the night. Her dose must have been at least 1\r\ngrain. This would make 60 grains in the whole. Such a quantity of\r\ntartar emetic would be about a teaspoonful, and obviously could not\r\nbe introduced on two lumps of loaf sugar, as the following experiment\r\nshows:—Two rather large pieces of loaf sugar weighing together 204\r\ngrains were gently shaken with powdered tartar emetic, and the loose\r\npart shaken off. The lumps now looked rather powdery, but nothing very\r\nnoticeable. The amount of tartar emetic they had taken up was nearly\r\n3 grains (2·96), not nearly a teaspoonful, though amply sufficient to\r\ncause vomiting. It is not the _porosity_, but the roughness of surface,\r\nthat enables a powder to adhere to the sugar. The tartar emetic might\r\nhave been slipped into the egg-flip, out of the hand, at the same time\r\nthat the sugar was added, the mixture being afterwards stirred up.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. SMETHURST’S CASE.\r\n\r\nDR. TAYLOR AND MR. HERAPATH.\r\n\r\nIn his evidence before the committing magistrates, on the 20th of May,\r\nDr. Taylor said:—\r\n\r\n“I found no arsenic or antimony in any of the bottles delivered to me\r\nby Inspector McIntyre on the 5th and 7th of May, except one, and the\r\nhomœopathic medicine: that one was bottle 21.[192] When I received this\r\nbottle it was about half full of thin, watery-looking mixture, and\r\nI tested it. It had a cooling, pleasant saline taste, not repugnant,\r\nno smell. I detected nothing wrong with the taste. I evaporated some\r\nin a glass, and examined it by the microscope, and then found it was\r\nnot tartar emetic, as I thought. I then applied the tests for arsenic,\r\nand every test I tried was destroyed, and failed to show the existence\r\nof arsenic, owing, as I supposed, to there being in it, and my tests\r\nconvinced me that there was, something very peculiar about it that I\r\nhad not met before. I tried Reinsch’s process, but I found that it\r\ndissolved the copper-gauze as soon as I put it into the liquid. I then\r\ndetermined to extract this noxious agent, and continued to put in\r\ncopper-gauze until it no longer possessed the power to dissolve it.\r\nI then put in a piece of copper, which at once received the arsenic.\r\nI was able to decide by these tests that the mixture was chlorate of\r\npotash. I found there was of chlorate of potash 7 grains to the ounce,\r\nor 1 and 6/10ths per cent., and there was a grain of arsenic to every\r\nounce. I found that the taste of the liquid in this bottle was such\r\nthat no one would be likely to suspect that it contained arsenic,\r\nmore particularly as the quantity of arsenic was so small that the\r\nliquid could be mixed with any kind of food and swallowed without the\r\nperson being aware of it.[193] In the bottles brought to me by Dr.\r\nBerry[194] I found arsenic—_that was white arsenic_. I could not give\r\nan opinion on that in the evacuation (No. 2), as that was mixed with\r\nblood and mucus. In No. 1 there was biliary matter without any metallic\r\nsubstance.”\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the conviction of Smethurst, Mr. Herapath wrote the\r\nletter to the _Times_, on the 27th of August, before referred to in the\r\nLord Chief Baron’s communication to the Home Secretary, in which, after\r\na wordy and personal attack on Dr. Taylor, with special reference to\r\nhis having used for twenty years untested copper, he said:—\r\n\r\n“But was the arsenic said to have been found in bottle 21 really in\r\nthe copper used to prove its presence? Could the copper wire-gauze\r\ndissolved by 7 grains of chlorate of potash and its associated\r\nhydrochloric acid deposit one grain of arsenic? In the face of all\r\nEngland, I say it could not. The 100th part of a grain of arsenic in\r\nthat quantity of copper would render it so brittle that it could not\r\nbe drawn into wire at all, much less into fine wire fit for gauze. The\r\nfact is the whole set of operations were a bungle. Reinsch’s process\r\nis inapplicable where nitrates or chlorates are present. Taylor must\r\nhave known this: it was well known then that chlorates, nitrates,\r\narsenates, and other oxidizing agents, interfered with Reinsch’s\r\nprocess. When Taylor found the copper dissolved—he knew that one of\r\nthese oxidizing agents was present—he ought then to have either used\r\nMarsh’s test instead of Reinsch’s, or should have prepared the solution\r\nby sulphurous acid first. The method he did use was as dangerous as\r\ncould be.”\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Herapath communicated this opinion to the friends of\r\nSmethurst before the trial, as he ought to have done, does not appear.\r\nAt any rate he was not called for the defence, and his opinion was\r\napparently only made public after the conviction. It stands, therefore,\r\nlike all the other communications laid before the Home Secretary,\r\nuntested by cross-examination. How far was he correct?\r\n\r\nTaylor does not state how much of the liquid in bottle 21 he took\r\nfor analysis. Assuming that he took 1 ounce, 7 grains of chlorate\r\nwould dissolve, _at the most_, 22 grains of copper. If this yielded\r\n1 grain of arsenic, the copper must have contained 4½ per cent. of\r\nthat poison—an impossible quantity. Less than ½ per cent. of arsenic\r\nrenders copper brittle. So far Herapath was right.[195]\r\n\r\n(2.) If Taylor was right that what he got was _white arsenic,\r\nthat could not have come from the copper, which can only contain\r\narsenicum—metallic arsenic_. Therefore if Taylor’s analysis was not\r\naltogether wrong, _in bottle 21 there really was arsenic, and the\r\nprisoner was proved to have had the materials for poisoning in his\r\npossession_.\r\n\r\nTaylor’s procedure in dissolving up piece after piece of copper, which\r\nhad not been previously proved, by the same process, not to contain\r\narsenic, was highly blameable, and his assertion that he had previously\r\ntried his tests and found them pure, was not strictly true. Altogether,\r\nhis tests both for arsenic and antimony were not reliable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\nThe “bismuth” frequently referred to in the report of Smethurst’s\r\ntrial is the Bismuthi Subnitras, B. P., also known by the various\r\nnames of “Bismuthum Album,” “White Bismuth,” “Trisnitrate of Bismuth,”\r\n“Subnitrate of Bismuth,” “Magistery of Bismuth,” “Pearl White,” &c.\r\nThis compound is a basic nitrate of bismuth, Bi N 0_{4}, H_{2} 0: it is\r\ninsoluble in water, and is a heavy, white, minutely-crystalline powder,\r\nmuch used in medicine, and also as a cosmetic. The name “bismuth” is\r\nmisleading as applied to this drug, which is _not_ bismuth, but a\r\n_salt_ of that metal.\r\n\r\nOrdinary subnitrate of bismuth frequently contains various\r\nadulterations and impurities. The most usual adulterants are carbonate\r\nof lead, carbonate of lime and phosphate of lime (Royle’s Materia\r\nMedica, 1876): among the impurities which have been found are ammonia\r\n(Piper, Pharm. Journ., Ap. 21, 1877), arsenic, lead, iron, chlorine,\r\nand sodium salts. Some specimens of bismuth subnitrate analysed by\r\nHerapath contained 1 grain of arsenic in 1000: others contained as\r\nmuch as 1 grain in 433. Taylor, also, found arsenic in three samples\r\nout of five examined by him. Riche (J. Pharm. et Chim., 5, 384)\r\nstates that the majority of commercial samples of bismuth subnitrate\r\ncontain lead and arsenic, the former to the extent of ·03-·04 per\r\ncent. (as sulphate), and the latter (as arsenious acid) to ·002-·01\r\nper cent., while Chas. Ekin (Pharm Journ., 3, III., 381) remarks that\r\nthis preparation of bismuth is often very impure, containing much\r\nsubchloride, copper, and occasionally lead. On the other hand, three\r\nspecimens of subnitrate of bismuth, analysed by Bernays, contained no\r\narsenic, lead, or carbonic acid, while the percentage of bismuth oxide\r\npresent closely approximated to the theoretical amount. Moreover, in\r\nthe Practitioner, Mar. 1871, p. 191, the results of the examination of\r\nsix samples of bismuth subnitrate are given, the only impurities found\r\nbeing traces of chlorine and sulphuric acid: there was no arsenic.\r\n_Hence it is evident that subnitrate of bismuth does not always contain\r\narsenic: and the quantity of this impurity, when present, is so minute\r\nas (having regard to the small doses in which the drug is usually\r\nprescribed in medicine) to be insufficient to produce the graver\r\nsymptoms of arsenical poisoning._[196]\r\n\r\nThe presence of arsenic in bismuth subnitrate may easily be detected by\r\nMarsh’s test.\r\n\r\nSubnitrate of bismuth nearly always contains arsenic and other\r\nimpurities, when it has been prepared from commercial bismuth. The\r\nBritish Pharmacopœia, therefore; very properly directs that _purified_\r\nbismuth (Bismuthum Purificatum, B. P.) should be used in the\r\npreparation of this drug: the B. P. method of purifying the metal is\r\nas follows. 10 ounces of bismuth and 1 ounce of nitrate of potash are\r\nfused together in a crucible, heated and stirred, until the salt has\r\nsolidified into a slag over the metal: the salt is now removed, another\r\nounce of nitrate of potash is added, and the remainder of the process\r\nis repeated. The fused bismuth is now poured into a mould, and allowed\r\nto cool.\r\n\r\nHerapath states that the arsenic is not all removed by this process,\r\nand he proposes to boil the nitrate in solution of a caustic alkali,\r\nwhich removes the arsenic and converts the bismuth into oxide, from\r\nwhich the salts can be prepared (Royle).\r\n\r\nFrom the purified metal subnitrate of bismuth can be prepared by the\r\nfollowing process, which is that given in the British Pharmacopœia.\r\n2 ounces of purified bismuth are gradually added to a mixture of 4\r\nfluid ounces nitric acid with three ounces distilled water: when\r\neffervescence has ceased, heat is applied for a few minutes, and\r\nthe solution is decanted from any insoluble residue. The liquid is\r\nconcentrated by evaporation to 2 fluid ounces, and poured into half a\r\ngallon of distilled water. The precipitate formed (Bi N 0_{4}, H_{2}\r\n0) is well washed by decantation, filtered, and finally dried at a\r\ntemperature not exceeding 150° F.\r\n\r\nIn the event of the bismuth used not having been thoroughly purified,\r\nand being therefore still likely to contain a trace of arsenic, a\r\nmodification of the above process, recommended by R. Schneider (Journ.\r\nPrakt. Chem., 1879, 418), may be employed. It consists in _heating_\r\nthe acid before the bismuth is added, and continuing the heating until\r\nthe metal is dissolved. If arsenic be present, the solution will\r\ncontain in suspension a white precipitate of _bismuth arsenate_, which\r\nis nearly insoluble in nitric acid, and can be removed by filtration\r\nthrough asbestos, before the solution is diluted. Cold nitric acid\r\nwould convert any arsenic present into _bismuth arsenite_, which is\r\nreadily soluble in nitric acid, and could not, therefore, be separated\r\nby filtration.\r\n\r\n“_Grey powder_” is Hydrargyrum cum Creta, B. P., and consists of one\r\npart of metallic mercury in a very finely divided state, mixed with\r\ntwo parts of chalk. It is made by rubbing mercury and prepared chalk\r\ntogether until metallic globules are no longer visible. The mercury\r\nin this preparation always becomes in course of time more or less\r\noxidised, the amount of oxide formed varying according to the length of\r\ntime the mixture has been kept, and the extent of its exposure to the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIron, silica, and phosphoric acid, might be present in very small\r\nquantities as impurities, in many samples of grey powder: caustic\r\nlime could not possibly occur, unless the specimen had been subjected\r\nto a red heat, which would drive off the mercury and so spoil the\r\npreparation. Antimony and arsenic would rarely be met with as\r\nimpurities in grey powder, and if present, would only be in very minute\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n POISONING BY ACONITIA OR ACONITINE. THE WIMBLEDON POISONING CASE—DR.\r\n LAMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER this head of poisons, there is only one trial to report in\r\nfull, that of Dr. Lamson for the murder of his brother-in-law, Percy\r\nMalcolm John, at Wimbledon, on Saturday, the 3rd of December, 1881,\r\nfor which he was tried before Mr. Justice Hawkins, at the Central\r\nCriminal Court, on the 8th of March, 1882, and the five following days.\r\nThe especial difficulties in the way of detecting this preparation of\r\naconite, invested the case with more than usual interest to both the\r\nmedical and legal profession. The subsequent attempt by the convict’s\r\nfriends to induce the Home Secretary to delay his execution, in order\r\nthat his mental condition might be inquired into, backed as it was by\r\nthe American Government, kept alive the public interest to an unusual\r\nextent, and bid fair to revive another such controversy as that which\r\nfollowed, but with a different result, on the conviction of Smethurst.\r\nBy the kindness of Mr. W. A. Mills, Dr. Lamson’s solicitor, I have had\r\nthe advantage of reading the whole of the very numerous affidavits\r\ntendered in support of this application, of which I have given a\r\nsummary at the close of the trial.[197]\r\n\r\nThough the trial now reported is the only one in which aconitia was\r\nemployed, other forms of aconite have been used in previous cases. In\r\nthat of Dr. Pritchard it was administered in the form of tincture of\r\naconite, and as far back as 1841, in the case of _Reg._ v. _McConkey_,\r\nit was administered as powdered aconite root. In this case the reputed\r\npoisoner was tried at the Lent Assizes, Monaghan, and the medico-legal\r\ninvestigation was conducted by the late Dr. Geoghegan, of Dublin. As\r\nin Pritchard’s and Lamson’s cases, the medical evidence was beset with\r\ndifficulties, for no trace of the poison could be discovered in the\r\nbody, and it was only by a close analysis of symptoms and appearances\r\nthat the charge was brought home to the prisoner. The deceased had\r\neaten at his dinner some greens dressed for him by the prisoner: he\r\ncomplained of their having a sharp taste, and this was perceived also\r\nby another person present who tasted them. It was ascertained that\r\nthe deceased, soon after the meal, had vomited a greenish matter,\r\nand suffered from purging, restlessness, incoherence, lockjaw, and\r\nclenching of the hands. He died in about three hours after having eaten\r\nthe greens, but was not seen by a medical man while living. The chief\r\nappearance met with was in the stomach, where the mucous membrane was\r\nof a light reddish-brown colour. Traces of vegetable matter were found\r\nin the intestines, but no poison could be detected, either botanically\r\nor chemically. The symptoms suffered by a friend of the deceased,\r\nwho had accidentally tasted the greens, were very characteristic of\r\npoisoning by aconite. In _two_ minutes he felt a burning heat in the\r\nmouth, throat, gullet, and stomach; then a sensation of swelling in\r\nthe face, with a general feeling of numbness and creeping of the\r\nskin. Restlessness, dimness of sight, and stupor almost amounting to\r\ninsensibility, followed; and in about an hour after the meal he was\r\nfound speechless—frothing at the nose and mouth, the hands and jaws\r\nclenched, appearing occasionally as if dead, and then again reviving.\r\nVomiting, purging, tenderness at the pit of the stomach, cramps,\r\ntingling of the flesh, and a burning taste in the mouth, followed. This\r\nman did not entirely recover until after the lapse of five weeks. The\r\nprisoner was convicted, and confessed before his execution that the\r\npowdered root of Monkshood (aconite) had been mixed with pepper and\r\nsprinkled over the greens.[198]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIMBLEDON POISONING CASE.\r\n\r\n _Before_ THE HON. MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS, _at the_ CENTRAL CRIMINAL\r\n COURT, _March 9, and five following days, 1882_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n _For the Prosecution_: The Solicitor-General (Sir F. Herschel), Mr.\r\n Poland, _and_ Mr. A. L. Smith.\r\n\r\n _For the Defence_: Mr. Montagu Williams, Mr. C. Matthews, Mr. E.\r\n Gladstone, _and_ Mr. W. S. Robson.\r\n\r\n_George Henry Lamson_, surgeon, aged 29, was indicted for the murder of\r\nhis brother-in-law, Percy Malcolm John, at Blenheim House, Wimbledon,\r\non December 3rd, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CASE.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1881, among the pupils at the school of Mr. Bedbrook,\r\nof Blenheim House, Wimbledon, was Percy Malcolm John, the youngest of\r\nthe five children of a Manchester merchant, a lad of about nineteen\r\nyears of age, a sad sufferer from paralysis of the lower limbs produced\r\nby curvature of the spine, but otherwise in a fair state of health.\r\nSince the death of their mother in 1869, the children had been orphan\r\nwards in Chancery, and previously to 1881, one brother and one sister\r\nhad died, under age, another sister had married a Mr. Chapman, and the\r\nthird the prisoner, a medical practitioner at Bournemouth, who was now\r\nindicted for the murder of his brother-in-law. By the wills of their\r\nparents, the children, as they came of age or married, were entitled\r\nto the family property in equal shares, those of such as died under\r\nage passing to the survivors. Hence, at the time of his death, Percy\r\nJohn had property in expectance to the amount of £3,000, which, in the\r\nevent of his death as a minor, would be equally divided between his\r\ntwo married sisters, and by the settlement made by Mrs. Lamson on her\r\nmarriage, her share would come into the hands of the prisoner.[199]\r\nThough such a sad sufferer from paralysis as to be unable to move\r\nabout readily except in a wheel-chair, and only able to drag himself\r\nbackwards up a few stairs,[200] there were no symptoms of serious\r\nbodily illness in the lad: his temper was good, and his intelligence\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nIn his brother-in-law’s health Lamson appeared to take great interest,\r\nvisiting him at the school, having him to stay at his own house, and\r\nsending to his master from America some medicines which he stated had\r\nbeen found useful in that country in similar cases. On the 1st of\r\nDecember, the prisoner wrote to the boy that he would come to see him\r\nthe next evening, before he left for Paris—a promise which he failed\r\nto keep.[201] On the 3rd, however, about seven in the evening, he came,\r\nbringing with him some sweets, a cake, and a box containing gelatine\r\ncapsules, which he told the master he had brought for him from America,\r\nas convenient for enabling him to administer nauseous medicines to his\r\npupils. At this interview with his brother-in-law, he persuaded Mr.\r\nBedbrook, who was present, to take one of these capsules to try how\r\neasily they were swallowed. Whilst doing so, the master noticed that\r\nthe prisoner was filling another with some powdered sugar, which he\r\nhad asked for, on the plea of destroying the alcohol in some wine of\r\nwhich he was partaking. When he had put in the sugar, the prisoner,\r\nturning to the lad, shook up the capsule, saying, “It has to be shaken\r\nin order that the medicine may go to the bottom. You are good at\r\ntaking medicine; take this.” The boy swallowed the capsule, and within\r\na few minutes after, the prisoner, saying that he wanted to catch the\r\ntidal-train for Paris, left the school-house. In about twenty minutes\r\nafterwards Percy complained of heartburn, gradually became worse, was\r\ncarried up to bed, and vomited largely in the closet.[202] “He felt,”\r\nhe said, “as he had done in the previous August when the prisoner gave\r\nhim a pill in the Isle of Wight.” He was in great pain, violently\r\nrestless, and with difficulty kept down by those who were holding him.\r\nAfter more simple remedies had failed to relieve him, the doctors\r\nwho had been called in injected morphia under the skin, which had a\r\ntemporary effect. This was subsequently repeated, but with no apparent\r\nresult, and shortly afterwards he died, within four hours of swallowing\r\nthe capsule. The _post-mortem_ examination revealed no signs of such\r\na natural form of disease as would account for his sudden death—the\r\nonly sign of disease being the long-standing curvature of the spine,\r\ndistressing, but at that time innocuous. A chemical analysis of the\r\nstomach and other parts of the body was had, and, so far as the present\r\nstate of scientific knowledge could decide, it was the firm opinion of\r\nthe experienced analysts Drs. Stevenson and Dupré, that death was due\r\nto an irritant vegetable poison, and that that poison was aconitia,\r\na most highly poisonous vegetable alkaloid, containing the active\r\nprinciple of aconite, the product of the root of monkshood.\r\n\r\nSuspicion naturally fell on the prisoner, and was greatly increased\r\nwhen it was discovered that a few days before his last visit to the\r\nboy he had purchased aconitia in London, and that previously to the\r\nillness of the deceased in the Isle of Wight, the prisoner had also\r\npurchased of a druggist at Shanklin some of this deadly poison. In the\r\nmeantime the prisoner had gone to Paris, whence on the 8th of December\r\nhe unexpectedly returned, presented himself to the police at Scotland\r\nYard, in consequence, as he said, of the reports he had seen in the\r\npapers, and, apparently to his surprise, was taken into custody.\r\n\r\nOther incidents in the prisoner’s career and conduct gradually came\r\nto light. Whilst in practice as a surgeon at Bournemouth he had been\r\nin great pecuniary difficulties, though he had received his share of\r\nthe property of that one of the children who had died a minor; an\r\nexecution had been put into his house, and at the time of the murder he\r\nwas admittedly in straitened circumstances. Again, in the boy’s boxes\r\nat school, in addition to some genuine quinine powders purchased of a\r\nchemist in the Isle of Wight, and proved to be free from poison, which\r\nhad been sent to the boy by the prisoner, were three heavily charged\r\nwith aconitia, and two pills containing this deadly drug. Again, he had\r\nwritten to the boy on the 1st of December that he would call on him on\r\nhis way to Paris the next day. He went to Wimbledon, however, on the\r\nevening of the 2nd, with his friend, a Mr. Tulloch, whom he left at the\r\nstation, whilst he professed to have gone to the school, and to whom he\r\nsaid that “he had seen his brother-in-law, who was much worse, and that\r\nhe did not expect he would live long, and that he would not go on to\r\nParis that night, as Mr. Bedbrook, who was a director of a continental\r\nline, had told him that there was a bad boat on.” All this was untrue.\r\nHe had never been to the school, and Mr. Bedbrook had nothing to do\r\nwith any continental line. He had invented the whole story.\r\n\r\nIn the trial that followed, the interest centred on the impossibility\r\nof detecting vegetable poisons by any chemical tests, and on the\r\nnecessity, as in Dr. Pritchard’s case, with aconite, of relying on\r\nthe test of tasting the extract from the various parts of the body.\r\nOn this test, supported by the effects observed on injecting drops of\r\nthe extract under the skins of mice, which successively died of the\r\noperation, and exhibited the same symptoms before death as resulted\r\nfrom similar injections of pure aconitia, depended the proof that\r\nthe death resulted from this poison. I proceed therefore to give the\r\nmedical and analytical evidence in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF MEDICAL ATTENDANTS.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Berry_, of Wimbledon, the regular medical attendant at the school,\r\nwho had known the deceased for a year and a half, and only had occasion\r\nto attend him twice during that time, once for vaccination, and another\r\ntime for an eruption on the skin, his state of health being otherwise\r\ngood, gave the following account of the symptoms:—\r\n\r\n “On Saturday, Dec. 3, I arrived at the school about five minutes to\r\n nine p.m., and was taken by Mr. Bedbrook to Percy John’s room.[203] He\r\n was in bed, and partly undressed, and in great pain in the stomach. He\r\n also complained of the skin of his face being drawn, and that there\r\n was a sense of constriction in the throat, in consequence of which he\r\n was unable to swallow. He was retching and vomiting; the vomit was a\r\n small quantity of dark-coloured fluid. I asked him shortly after the\r\n cause of his illness (Mr. Bedbrook had previously made a communication\r\n to me), and said to Percy, ‘Did your brother-in-law ever give you\r\n quinine pills before?’ He said, ‘Yes, at Shanklin.’ I said, ‘Did it\r\n make you like this before?’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘but not so bad.’ There\r\n is nothing in ordinary quinine pills to produce such symptoms. I\r\n did not form an opinion at that time to what the symptoms were due.\r\n During an interval of the vomiting I had some white of egg beaten\r\n up in water given to him, which he was able to swallow, and had hot\r\n linseed poultices placed on his stomach. He was very restless on the\r\n bed—violently so, throwing himself backwards and forwards and from\r\n side to side. Several people held him to prevent him from injuring\r\n himself. He did not improve at all under this treatment. Hearing that\r\n Dr. Little, a medical man of Wimbledon, was in the house, I had him\r\n sent for, and in about twenty or twenty-five minutes after I had been\r\n in the room he came. I consulted him, and we determined to inject\r\n some morphia. I left the house to get the morphia and an instrument,\r\n being away five to ten minutes. When I returned the deceased was\r\n not better, and I injected a quarter of a grain of morphia under\r\n the skin, over the region of the stomach. This was done about ten\r\n o’clock. The symptoms abated somewhat about half-past ten, but not\r\n very much. They were still all present, but in a modified degree, and\r\n then they returned again a little before eleven as severely as before\r\n the injection of the morphia. A little before eleven the deceased\r\n asked to have the morphia injected again. He complained then of pain\r\n in his body, but not in any particular part. I then about eleven\r\n injected one-sixth of a grain of morphia in the same place as before,\r\n but it had no apparent effect. In about ten minutes he became a little\r\n unconscious and wandering. That was the first time I noticed it. His\r\n breathing became slower and sighing, and the heart’s action weaker and\r\n weaker, and he died about twenty minutes after eleven.”\r\n\r\nIn his account of the symptoms and the progress of the case until the\r\ndeceased’s death, Dr. Berry was fully confirmed by Dr. Little, who\r\nadded that at that time they were of opinion that the death was due to\r\nan irritant poison. _Dr. Berry_ then gave the results of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE _POST-MORTEM_ EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n “After his death Dr. Little and I collected some of the vomit which\r\n had been caught in a basin in the bedroom. (He had previously vomited\r\n in the closet.) I also collected some from the floor of the bedroom\r\n and the closet, and the whole was put into a cup together, and thence\r\n into a clean bottle, which was sealed with my own seal, and given to\r\n Mr. Bond on the day of the _post-mortem_ examination.\r\n\r\n “On Tuesday, Dec. 6th, Mr. Bond, Dr. Little, and myself, made a\r\n _post-mortem_ examination. I made some notes at the time which I have\r\n here. With the exception of the paralysis of the lower limbs, he was\r\n a particularly well-developed, muscular lad. The brain was slightly\r\n congested superficially, as well as the substance of the brain itself.\r\n By superficially, I mean the membranes. There was no fluid in the\r\n ventricles of the brain, nor under the membranes. The pupils of the\r\n eyes were dilated; the lips pale and the tongue bleached; in the\r\n right lung were some old adhesions at the apex, between the lung and\r\n the chest wall, the result of inflammation at some previous time.\r\n Both lungs were healthy, but considerably congested in the lower\r\n part. The heart was healthy muscularly, the valves also healthy; _it\r\n was almost entirely empty and flaccid_. There was a small quantity\r\n of fluid in the _pericardium_. The liver was normal in size, but\r\n intensely congested. The kidneys were also normal in size, but much\r\n congested, and the spleen was also congested but normal in size.\r\n The stomach had the mucous membrane congested throughout. Under the\r\n surface, near the large end of the stomach, were six or eight small\r\n yellowish-grey patches, slightly raised, about the size of a small\r\n bean. Towards the smaller end of the stomach were two or three similar\r\n smaller spots. I believe that they were the result of inflammation,\r\n caused recently before death. The stomach contained three or four\r\n ounces of dark fluid, which was carefully preserved, and of which\r\n Mr. Bond took charge. I examined the _duodenum_, the first part of\r\n which was greatly congested, and there were patches of congestion on\r\n other parts of the small intestines. Portions of the intestines were\r\n taken care of by Mr. Bond, who also took possession of the stomach\r\n itself and portions of the liver, with the gall bladder, both of the\r\n kidneys and the spleen. The bladder contained three or four ounces of\r\n urine, which was drawn off and taken possession of by Mr. Bond. There\r\n were no traces of inflammation in the _peritoneum_. The membranes of\r\n the spinal cord were greatly congested. Except the appearance of the\r\n lungs and the curvature of the spine, these were all the appearances\r\n I noted in the _post-mortem_ examination. There was nothing in the\r\n _post-mortem_ examination to account for death from natural causes.\r\n I should say that he died from the effect of some irritant poison,\r\n the administration of which would, I believe, account for all the\r\n appearances. Aconitia is a vegetable alkaloid poison, and the\r\n appearances would be consistent with a fatal dose of that poison, but\r\n I have no special knowledge on the subject.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, the witness repeated, in several forms, that\r\nhe had no special knowledge of aconitia, but some of aconite as used\r\ninternally for cancer, erysipelas, and other complaints, and was unable\r\nto say whether a grain of aconitia blended into 20 pills would be good\r\nfor curvature of the spine, and that the remedies he applied were for\r\nthe violent irritation of the stomach from which up to the time of his\r\ndeath he believed the deceased was suffering.\r\n\r\n “At the _post-mortem_ I examined the spinal cord and the spinal\r\n curvature. The cord was healthy, but congested. The existence of\r\n paralysis is consistent with a healthy spinal cord, but not with\r\n healthy bone and healthy intervertebral cartilages. I did not examine\r\n the condition of the arteries in the neighbourhood of the curvature.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Are you not aware that there are many cases on\r\n record of death having resulted from the effects of pressure on the\r\n arteries in the regions of these curvatures?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No; but I am not prepared to say that there are not such\r\n cases.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Will you undertake to say that death did not result\r\n from such a cause as that?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I cannot undertake to say. I did not examine to see the\r\n effect of the spinal curvature on the position of the lungs.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Nor what its effect was on the heart?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Do you not know that the lungs are very much\r\n displaced in some cases of spinal curvature?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes, they are.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Is not the heart very much displaced?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“You say this irritation of the stomach was\r\n consistent with poisoning with vegetable alkaloids, and yet you have\r\n never seen a case of such poisoning?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“I have not; I did not take means to ascertain whether the\r\n appearances were _post-mortem_. I know—only from Taylor’s ‘Medical\r\n Jurisprudence’—that vegetable alkaloids have produced these symptoms.”\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_, the witness said that “he could not think that the\r\ndeath was caused by anything he saw in the curvature of the spine; that\r\nif death had been caused by pressure on the arteries, he should not\r\nhave expected to find the symptoms of irritation in the stomach which\r\nexisted after death; that displacement of the lungs and heart had not\r\nbeen, in this case, produced by the curvature of the spine, and, if\r\nthere had been much displacement of either, he could not have failed\r\nto observe it.” Dr. Little was equally inexperienced with Dr. Berry in\r\ncases of poisoning, but agreed with him that the curvature of the spine\r\nin the lumbar region had not displaced either the lungs, the stomach,\r\nor the heart, and that the patches on the surface of the stomach were\r\nof recent date—“might have existed for days, but not for weeks, but\r\nnot without the patient suffering.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bond_, the Lecturer on Forensic Medicine at the Westminster\r\nHospital, detailed the various portions of the body which he put aside\r\nfor chemical analysis and delivered to Dr. Dupré; the receipt of two\r\npills given to him by Dr. Berry, one of which was taken out of one of\r\nthe capsule boxes after the boy’s death, and the other brought to Dr.\r\nBerry whilst he was in attendance on the deceased, and two packets\r\nof sweets, and part of a cake. He further confirmed the evidence of\r\nDr. Berry as to the results of the _post-mortem_ examination, with\r\nthe exception, that Dr. Berry had omitted to state that “the whole\r\nof the lungs were somewhat congested, and the anterior part of them\r\nexceedingly so, and that the body was not decomposed.” In his opinion\r\nthere was nothing to account for death from natural causes, and\r\nhe attributed it to poisoning by some vegetable alkaloid, such as\r\naconitia, a fatal dose of which could be given in one of the capsules.\r\nThe appearances on the _post-mortem_ examination were, he considered,\r\nsuch as he should expect to find in death by aconitia. He agreed also\r\nwith the other medical men that the grey patches on the stomach were\r\nrecent, due to intense irritation, and would cause the deceased great\r\npain, and induce vomiting. On the question of the probable effect\r\nof the curvature of the spine, he gave the following most material\r\nevidence:—\r\n\r\n “The principal curvature was in the lower part of the body; in the\r\n upper part of the spine there was slight anti-posterior or forward\r\n curvature, but it was not enough to affect the position of the heart\r\n or lungs relatively to each other. The cavities of the chest appeared\r\n to me to be deeper from before backward than usual. The heart was in\r\n its right position, except perhaps that it was higher up in the body\r\n than is normal. In the lower region there was a good deal of lateral\r\n curvature. I examined the spinal cord down to the end of the dorsal\r\n vertebræ, and I found the membranes very much congested, but otherwise\r\n it was quite healthy, to all appearance. I did not examine it with a\r\n microscope. In the lower lumbar region I did not open the canal, for\r\n it was very twisted, and I had difficulty in getting it open. No\r\n disease there could have caused sudden death. The curvature appeared\r\n to be of long standing; the bones were very hard, and there was no\r\n active disease there. I think it impossible that death could have been\r\n caused by pressure produced by the curvature on one of the arteries.”\r\n\r\nThe _cross-examination_ of Mr. Bond by Mr. Williams was directed,\r\n_first_, to whether the time at which after taking the dose the\r\nsymptoms might be expected to show, depended on its amount. Of this the\r\nwitness had no knowledge, but considered that that would be determined\r\nby the fulness or emptiness of the stomach; and _secondly_, whether he\r\nwould expect to find in the stomach the amount of poison that would\r\ncause death. On this last point the following questions and answers\r\nmust be reported:—\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Would you, supposing death had been occasioned by\r\n aconitia, expect to find the amount of poison that had caused death,\r\n or would it have disappeared?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“I believe it would be possible to use so small a dose\r\n that it could not be found in the stomach.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Supposing death caused by aconitia, would you expect\r\n to find the actual amount that caused death?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“That would depend on the amount. My opinion is that if\r\n death was caused by an ordinary amount, traces would be found.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Of the amount that caused death?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“Not of all.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“And you say aconitia enough to cause death might\r\n leave no trace in the stomach?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“Not of aconitia in the stomach.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Do you agree with this: ‘that the poison found on\r\n analysis would be over and above that used up in causing death?’”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“No; I should not agree to that, unless it means that so\r\n small a quantity had been absorbed, causing death, leaving a larger\r\n amount which did not cause death. What I mean is, that the poison\r\n which may have caused death has been removed from the stomach to other\r\n organs, and it is quite possible that a larger amount may be left\r\n behind in the stomach than the portion which has been removed, and\r\n caused death.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Do you mean that it would be decomposed in causing\r\n death?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“I do not know whether it would or not. I think not. I\r\n will not give a decided answer one way or the other. I have no idea.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“‘Guy and Ferrier on Forensic Medicine’ is one of the\r\n first authorities, is it not?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“Yes, I think so.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Do you agree with this, in regard to aconitia, ‘that\r\n the commencement of the symptoms may be in a few minutes or in one or\r\n two hours’?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“I do not know anything about poisoning by the alkaloid\r\n aconitia, so I cannot say one way or other.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“I understood you to say, that the ventricles of the\r\n heart were both empty?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“The ventricles and auricles were both empty.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Can you produce any case on record where such a\r\n symptom as that has appeared in poisoning by aconitia?”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Bond._—“No, I cannot produce any case on record of poisoning by\r\n aconitia.”\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_, the witness declined to speak more positively on\r\nthis point, on the ground that he was a surgeon, and therefore had not\r\nhad experience in the pathology of such cases. His only experience in\r\npoisoning by alkaloids had been in a case of strychnia. In reply to\r\nthe Judge, he admitted “that other vegetable poisons, even a strong\r\nsolution of oil of mustard, would produce the same congestion of the\r\nstomach, and the same yellow marks as had been found; that a vegetable\r\nalkaloid would pass within a minute from the stomach into the blood,\r\nand that it would be more likely to be found in the liver, kidneys, and\r\nurine, than in the heart; he did not know whether strychnia had been\r\nfound in the heart when not discoverable in the blood and the urine.”\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Thomas Stevenson_, Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence and Chemistry\r\nat Guy’s Hospital, and Examiner in Forensic Medicine at the London\r\nUniversity, after enumerating the various matters handed to him and\r\nDr. Dupré by Mr. Bond for analysis,[204] and stating that the methods\r\nof it were arranged with his colleague, the manual operations carried\r\nout by both of them, and the results of those performed by Dr. Dupré\r\nexamined by himself, gave the following evidence, which must be\r\nreported in full.\r\n\r\n “The bottle marked ‘A’ contained portions of the liver, spleen, and\r\n kidney. To that was applied Stas’s process. I obtained an alkaloidal\r\n extract which contained a trace of morphia, and which, placed on the\r\n tongue, gave a faint sensation like that produced by aconitia. I\r\n reserved that for experiments. To the bottle ‘2,’ which contained\r\n part of the bowels, large and small, I applied the same process. I\r\n obtained an extract which I have done nothing further with—that\r\n is to say, I have not tested the extract. No. 3 contained a fluid,\r\n the contents of the stomach, 3½ ozs. This was treated in a somewhat\r\n similar way. The fluid contained a raisin and a piece of fruit like\r\n the top of a carrot or an apple. From that fluid I obtained, by Stas’s\r\n process, an alkaloidal extract, which was distinctive, and produced\r\n a very faint sensation, like that of aconitia. When placed on the\r\n tongue, burning of the lips was produced, though the extract did not\r\n touch the lips. Burning, tingling—a kind of numbness peculiar but\r\n difficult to define; a salivation creating a desire to expectorate,\r\n a sensation at the back of the throat of swelling up, and this was\r\n followed by a peculiar seared sensation of the tongue, as if a hot\r\n iron had been drawn over it, or some strong caustic placed on it. I\r\n reserved that alkaloidal extract also for physiological experiments.\r\n No. 4 D contained a human stomach, and 7 ozs. of spirits added to\r\n preserve the stomach. I observed that the stomach was reddened, I\r\n think from congestion, in the region of the greater curvature, and\r\n posteriorly. At one part there was a little pit as if a blister or\r\n inflammatory effusion of lymph had broken. From the stomach and liquid\r\n in the bottle I made an extract by Stas’s process, and obtained an\r\n alkaloidal extract. That I reserved; but I tasted it, and it had no\r\n particular taste that I could recognize. Next was No. 5 E, containing\r\n the urine, 6 ozs. I opened it in Dr. Dupré’s presence. He found that\r\n 4 ozs. of urine had had 2 ozs. of spirit added to preserve it. I made\r\n an extract from a portion of that liquid—three-fourths. I obtained an\r\n alkaloidal extract which contained a trace of morphia. By a further\r\n process I obtained more morphia, but the first alkaloid I referred to\r\n was more than could be accounted for by the morphia I obtained. Some\r\n of this extract was placed upon my tongue. It produced the effects of\r\n aconitia, which I have already described, in a marked degree, and a\r\n peculiar burning sensation extending downwards towards the stomach.”\r\n\r\n _By the Judge._—“I have 50 or 80 alkaloids in my possession, and I\r\n have tasted most of them.”\r\n\r\n _The Solicitor-General._—“How long did the effects last?”\r\n\r\n _Witness._—“About four hours—not all the effects, but the burning on\r\n the tongue did. I made an experiment on about one-third of the urine.\r\n I injected it beneath the skin of a mouse. The animal was obviously\r\n affected in two minutes. From that time it exhibited symptoms of\r\n poisoning, and died in 30 minutes. I made some experiments on mice\r\n from Morson’s aconitia, which I procured for the purpose. I injected\r\n some of that, after dissolving it, under the skins of several mice.\r\n It operated on the mice in a manner which was undistinguishable from\r\n the effect of the urine. The effects of the two I might say were\r\n ridiculously alike. Tartaric acid was previously used on a mouse in\r\n the same quantities and was found inoperative. I retained portions\r\n of the extract made from the liver, spleen, and kidneys, from the\r\n stomach, and from the contents of the stomach. All contained an\r\n alkaloid; two giving a slight taste of aconitia, and the third no\r\n taste. I then mixed together the alkaloidal extracts, Nos. 1, 3, and\r\n 4, and I injected it under the skin of a mouse, in the same manner,\r\n and it produced effects on the mouse, in nine minutes from that time,\r\n of severe symptoms of poisoning, and the animal died in 22 minutes.\r\n These symptoms were precisely similar to those produced by Morson’s\r\n aconitia. No. 6, the vomit, contained nearly ten ounces, or half a\r\n pint, of thick, pasty fluid stuff, with which also were spirits of\r\n wine. Dr. Dupré pointed out marks showing that to 5oz. of vomit 5oz.\r\n of spirit had been added. There was a good deal of solid matter in\r\n the vomit, which must have been of a solid character. I examined the\r\n solid portion and found it consisted of pieces of fat, a very small\r\n portion of the muscular fibre of some animal, pieces of onion, a\r\n little starch, probably that of wheat, a slice of candied peel like\r\n that put on the top of cake, a piece of apple pulp, raisins, and some\r\n pineapple, with just the odour of pineapple drops. I subsequently\r\n examined with the microscope the vomit again, the solid portions, to\r\n see if I could find anything corresponding to the root of aconite or\r\n the root of horseradish. I found neither. I made an extract from the\r\n vomit, and obtained an alkaloidal extract. The extract had no trace of\r\n morphia or of quinine. I applied it to the tongue with a very powerful\r\n result, such as that of aconitia. The severe forms of attack lasted\r\n for 6½ hours; it lasted for that time, though the effects did not then\r\n cease. I took 1-24th part for experiment on a mouse. I injected it\r\n into the back of a mouse. It was severely affected in 2½ minutes, the\r\n symptoms continuing till the time of its death, 15½ minutes after.\r\n Those symptoms were parallel with those of aconitia. In my judgment\r\n the vomit submitted to me contained a considerable quantity of\r\n aconitia.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Can you fix what quantity?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Approximately it was not less than one-seventh, and not\r\n more than one-fourth of a grain.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What would be a fatal dose of aconitia to a human being?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“There is only one fatal case I know of, and in that\r\n death was caused by about one-sixteenth of a grain. What is known to\r\n have caused death was not less than one-twenty-first of a grain, and\r\n not more than one-thirteenth. Each of the boxes produced contained\r\n capsules. There were only two pills in them. They were gelatine-coated\r\n pills, like those in the bottle. I examined those pills, or rather I\r\n saw Dr. Dupré do so. They were simply five-grain quinine pills.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“The packet of sweetmeats, No. 8. Did they contain any\r\n traces of poison?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“No. 9, the cake?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“That contained no traces of poison of any kind.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“No. 10, the capsules, did you examine them?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“They are simply gelatine capsules.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You have told us there were some pills loose?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes; there were four, and they were similar to those I\r\n have just referred to, quinine, gelatine-coated pills. There was some\r\n sugar in a paper. Some of the powders were in larger papers than\r\n others; six were in large. They contained 1½ grains of disulphate\r\n of quinine. There were 14 smaller papers containing powders. They\r\n were tied together in a bundle numbering from 7 to 20. They varied\r\n considerably in weight, the lowest weighed 6-10ths of a grain, the\r\n highest 1⅛ grains. Three of the powders differed in appearance. The\r\n average weight of those which were quinine were 9-10ths of a grain. I\r\n examined those powders, and I found they consisted, eleven of them,\r\n 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, and 20, of disulphate of quinine\r\n simply, the ordinary quinine powders, but varying considerably in\r\n weight, from 3-10ths of a grain up to 1¼ grains. Of the other three,\r\n my attention was drawn to No. 16 by Dr. Dupré; it was a different\r\n colour, as also were Nos. 17 and 19. No. 16 was an obvious mixture;\r\n there were two substances clearly to a chemist, who would have noticed\r\n the mixture at once. It was a very pale fawn, the mixture; the other\r\n was a pure white. No. 16 weighed 1-8/10 grs. or 1·79 grs. No. 17\r\n weighed ·88 of a grain; No. 19 weighed 1·26, or about 1¼ grs. In the\r\n No. 16, which appeared to be a mixture, it looked as if the quinine\r\n had been damaged. I tasted it, and in about three minutes a startling\r\n sensation came on. The sensation was severe for three hours, and then\r\n gradually went away after dinner.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Did you make a special examination of the pills?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What amount of aconitia was in the pills?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Decimal 83. In the quinine pills there was ·96. I tested\r\n the action of this quinine on a mouse. In three and a half minutes\r\n after I had administered it the effect was the same as before. In\r\n No. 17 there was aconitia, and in 19 there was aconitia; I cannot\r\n tell you how much. In 17 and 19 I noticed the difference in colouring\r\n between the ordinary quinine powders. The proportion of aconitia was\r\n considerably less in 16 as compared with 19.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is it usual to wrap pills in tinfoil?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Or to put them in boxes of this description?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Oh, no.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Were these two pills examined by yourself and Dr. Dupré?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes; one weighed 3 grs. and another 2¾. There was nothing\r\n particular in the appearance. There was a little bitterness at first\r\n with the 2¾ grain pill. I cut out a small piece with a penknife.\r\n We all took a little piece, I only took the 22nd part of a grain.\r\n Part of it was used for the microscope. It caused intense burning.\r\n The bitterness of quinine was followed by intense burning, and the\r\n same symptoms I have already described, but of a more severe kind. I\r\n injected some of that into the back of a mouse. It exhibited symptoms\r\n of poisoning, was very ill in two minutes, and it died in 4½ minutes.\r\n I came to the conclusion that there was ·45 of a grain of aconitia\r\n in that pill, or nearly half a grain. No. 12 was the sherry. I found\r\n no trace of poison in that, nor in the wafers. I have said the urine\r\n contained aconitia, showing that the poison had been absorbed into\r\n the blood, had passed through the tissues of the body, and had become\r\n excreted. I have said I found in the extracts traces of morphia. I\r\n have heard of the injection of morphia by Dr. Little and Dr. Berry\r\n during the last hour of the boy’s illness. The traces I found were\r\n such as I should have expected to find from that, both in the urine\r\n and probably in the liver too.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Could a fatal dose of aconitia be administered in such a\r\n capsule as this?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Oh, yes. Many times a fatal dose. I have put into one a\r\n grain of aconitia, and into another a half-grain.”\r\n\r\n [Capsules produced by Witness, and shown to Judge and Jury, to show\r\n how little space in the capsule was occupied even by the grain of\r\n aconitia.]\r\n\r\n Witness continued.—“The symptoms lasted after tasting the pill 7½\r\n hours, notwithstanding having taken a meal.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Supposing aconitia taken in a capsule of this\r\n description, would it prevent a taste on the tongue?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“I believe there is no test of aconitia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No specific or characteristic chemical test.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What are the tests?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“We can tell chemically that it is an alkaloid. Then\r\n there is the physiological test, the effect on the tongue and the\r\n neighbouring parts, and its general effect on the system if taken in\r\n any quantity. Then the other physiological test is that it will kill,\r\n after a definite course of symptoms, as shown in my experiments with\r\n the mice.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you any doubt that you did find aconitia in the\r\n portions of the body you examined and in the vomit?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Not the least. I have heard the description of the\r\n deceased boy. He had symptoms such as would arise from poisoning by\r\n aconite. His symptoms approached more nearly to those caused by that\r\n than any other poison. Judging from the symptoms discovered at the\r\n _post-mortem_ examination, I should say that he died from poisoning by\r\n aconitia.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is aconitia a medicine commonly used for spinal diseases\r\n in this country?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“I do not know if you are aware of its use here by\r\n medical men?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; the British Pharmacopœia orders it for external use,\r\n but makes no mention of any dose for internal use. It was formerly\r\n tried a quarter of a century ago, or thirty years ago, but it was\r\n given up because it was too dangerous.”\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_ by _Mr. Williams_, after he had stated that he\r\nhad never seen an acknowledged death from aconitia, but founded his\r\nopinion not only from tasting, testing, and the experiments on mice,\r\nbut from his reading, and that he knew that it was used in France\r\nand Germany, but not that it was sold at the French chemist’s in the\r\nHaymarket as a patent medicine, the examination proceeded as follows:—\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you know Guibert’s French book on chemistry?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes; I know the book. I have it in my possession.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Would you look at that book—is that it?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes; that is the book.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you there find a formula for pills with aconitia in\r\n them?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“And drops?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“For internal use?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No. The drops are for dropping in the ear; the pills are\r\n for internal use.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Also for ointment?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“And in the British Pharmacopœia you will find ‘Unguentum\r\n Aconitiæ,’ 8 grains of aconitia to 1 ounce of lard?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is Sidney Ringer an acknowledged authority on\r\n therapeutics?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you know his books?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you agree with this:—‘Aconite is used externally in\r\n the form of liniment or ointment to relieve pain?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“The ‘Unguentum Aconitiæ’ alludes to aconitia, does it\r\n not?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, the ointment does.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is that applied in neuralgic cases?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, it is used in neuralgia and rheumatism.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you agree with the statement, ‘That a piece of\r\n ointment the size of a bean or nut should be applied with friction,\r\n which enhances its efficacy?’”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, to the skin.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“A piece the size of a bean would contain half a grain of\r\n aconitia, would it not?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you agree that the application in such a case will\r\n cut short pain?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“And prevent sickness?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I do not know about that. Sickness is not a usual symptom\r\n in neuralgia and rheumatism.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Do you agree with this, that ‘Aconite diminishes\r\n sensibility, and it has been used internally in various painful\r\n diseases?’”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, aconite.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you heard of the use of aconitia in typhoid fever?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; I have heard of its use in fevers generally, but not\r\n in typhoid.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“In the _Journal of Medicine_, No. 27, March, 1882, by\r\n Dr. Phipson—--“[205]\r\n\r\n The _Solicitor-General_ objected that that was something written\r\n within a few days.\r\n\r\n _Mr. M. Williams._—“Then I will put this question generally. Have you\r\n heard of its use internally in severe cases of fever?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, I have heard of its use in fever, but not in typhoid.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you heard of its use in pleuro-pneumonia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, in very minute doses; it is recommended in a journal\r\n of medicine which is edited by a man who is not a medical man.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Your collaborateur, Dr. Dupré, is not a medical man, is\r\n he?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“With regard to the symptoms—the dilated pupils—are\r\n they not invariably dilated three days after death?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“After a natural death. The surface of the tongue being\r\n rough is no sure sign of aconitia poisoning. Congestion of the brain\r\n has been observed in aconite poisoning, but is no sure sign.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Has bloody fluid in the bag of the heart been met with\r\n in aconitia poisoning?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Would you expect to find the ventricles and auricles\r\n empty?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It has been observed in poisoning by preparations of\r\n aconitia; but in the only case of aconitia poisoning I know of\r\n the state of the heart is not mentioned. You will find it in the\r\n _Philadelphia Journal of Medicine_ of November last.”[206]\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is congested liver a sign of aconitia poisoning?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“The congestion of the internal viscera is an important\r\n sign of poisoning by aconitia. The congestion could be caused by\r\n various means. The kidneys being congested was consistent with\r\n aconite poisoning, but not dependent on it. The same could be said\r\n of congestion of the spleen. I am prepared to admit that cases may\r\n have occurred in which congestion has been caused without poison. The\r\n patches in the stomach may have existed days before death, but not\r\n without causing pain. I commenced the analysis of the contents of the\r\n stomach on the 10th of December. I commenced the analysis of the vomit\r\n the same day. I commenced to examine the urine the same day.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You say the bottle C, No. 3, contained matter from which\r\n you extracted an alkaloidal extract. Would you expect to find an\r\n alkaloid from morphia in the contents of the stomach?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; but I should expect to find it in the urine, and I\r\n found in that more alkaloid than was consistent with morphia. That\r\n requires the most delicate test. By a further extraction I got a\r\n little more morphia.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“The precise process I ask you for in testing the\r\n alkaloidal extract.”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I took half the contents of the stomach. I mixed it with\r\n such a quantity of rectified spirit as, with the spirit previously\r\n added by Dr. Dupré, made the proportion of spirit two volumes of\r\n spirit to one volume of matter. The liquid I took was acid in\r\n reaction. The liquid stood over from Sunday to Monday. It was then\r\n filtered. The insoluble part was well washed with rectified spirit.\r\n The clear liquid was then evaporated at a temperature below that\r\n of the human body, till it was almost solid. The portion I had not\r\n dissolved in spirit was then treated with an additional quantity of\r\n spirit, to which a little quantity of tartaric acid was added. The\r\n mixture was then warmed to 140 deg. Fahr. It was then cooled. The\r\n insoluble part was well washed with spirit, and the clear liquid\r\n evaporated at a temperature below that of the human body. A fairly\r\n solid residue was obtained. I now obtained two alcoholic extracts,\r\n each of which was treated in a precisely similar manner, but\r\n separately, by digesting them with warm absolute alcohol, or rather\r\n tepid, till the alcohol would take up and dissolve nothing more. The\r\n solutions in absolute alcohol were filtered and evaporated nearly\r\n to dryness. They were then treated with a little water. They were\r\n found to be acid in reaction, and the two solutions—that is to say,\r\n that from the plain spirit, and the other from the tartaric acid\r\n spirit—were mixed. Care was taken that they remained just faintly\r\n acid, and the solution was then agitated with washed ether. The ether\r\n was allowed to separate; it was drawn off, and replaced by fresh\r\n ether. This operation was carried out five times. The ether was set\r\n apart, and allowed to evaporate at a temperature below boiling point;\r\n that was reserved as not containing any alkaloid. The residue was oily\r\n and partially dissoluble with water; it was of a brownish colour. It\r\n was not weighed, but was a very appreciable quantity.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Were these tests conducted for aconitia only?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Oh, no; I tested for other poisons. The aqueous liquid\r\n which separated from the ether was made alkaline by carbonate of\r\n soda, and it was then agitated with a mixture of washed ether and\r\n washed chloroform. The ether-chloroform solution was then allowed to\r\n separate, drawn off, replaced by washed ether, the ether again drawn\r\n off, and again replaced by ether, which was again drawn off. These\r\n chloroform-ether mixtures were mixed and evaporated, and finally dried\r\n in vacuo over oil of vitriol. Before it was placed in the vacuum, I\r\n examined it to see if there were any volatile alkaloids, which would\r\n be distinguished by their peculiar odour. There were none. I then\r\n weighed it, after drying, and found its weight ·108 of a grain, or\r\n rather more than 1-10th of a grain. It was slightly crystalline in\r\n appearance. I tasted it, putting a little on my tongue. That was one\r\n of my taste tests.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“That was afterwards dissolved, and part of it was\r\n applied to the mouse?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Yes, but I had previously tested it for an alkaloid. I\r\n went through the same operation with the vomit and the urine, with\r\n only minor differences of details here and there as occasion required.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“You say that the effect on the tongue was characteristic\r\n of aconitia. Was it characteristic of nothing else?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Nothing else that I know of.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Not of veratria?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; I have tried that on the tongue, and its effect is\r\n different. I do not recollect that delphinia is like aconitia. Morphia\r\n has no marked bitterness. I know that the taste is very different from\r\n other substances. Pepperine has an immediate burning effect.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is not phosphoric acid a test for aconitia?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“No; it is given as a test, except by those who have\r\n studied it recently. I have made experiments with pure aconitia with\r\n no results. The book produced is written by an authority. Fluckijer,\r\n in his work on the subject, gives the reaction of aconitia, but it\r\n is German aconitia he refers to; it is very different to English\r\n aconitia. I see no reference to English aconitia in Fluckijer.”\r\n\r\n The book was handed back to counsel, and Mr. Montagu Williams said the\r\n date was 1879.\r\n\r\n _Witness, cross-examined further._—“The solution injected into the\r\n mouse was measured on each occasion. About three minims of liquid\r\n altogether was injected. With the exception of the urine and one of\r\n the vomits, the injections were unmixed. He believed, of course, that\r\n too much reliance must not be placed on experiments on animals.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is it not a recognised fact that alkaloids are found in\r\n the human body after death, irrespective of poisons?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is a question still _sub judice_. It has been asserted\r\n that such is the case where the stomach or other viscera has been much\r\n decomposed.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“What are called cadaveric alkaloids, utterly\r\n irrespective of the administration of poison?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“It is so asserted.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Is not Stas’s test a mode of extracting cadaveric\r\n alkaloids?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Cadaveric as well as natural alkaloids.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Would these cadaveric alkaloids produce the same effects\r\n as the natural alkaloids?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“They have been described as producing the same effects;\r\n but I have seen no description of one producing the effects of\r\n aconitia. There is a test distinguishing these cadaveric alkaloids\r\n from all natural alkaloids, except morphia and veratria, and certainly\r\n from aconitia. That test was applied to these extracts when no morphia\r\n was present,—the reduction of the ferricyanide to the ferro-cyanide\r\n of potassium. There is an authority for the method of obtaining and\r\n distinguishing these cadaveric alkaloids. I was one of the first to\r\n point out that alkaloidal extracts from the stomachs of the dead\r\n would kill frogs if injected under the skin. I have read most of the\r\n foreign writers on this subject. I have not read Peschi, and cannot\r\n say whether they produce pricking of the tongue. I do not remember any\r\n of them describing sensations produced on the tongue from cadaveric\r\n alkaloids, similar to those from aconitia. Many things would produce\r\n prickings on the tongue.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Have you found the ordinary residue of the stomach from\r\n the dead poison the lower animals?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“I have never known it to do so. I will not say it is not\r\n so.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“How long after the administration of aconitia would you\r\n expect the symptoms to appear?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“From a few minutes to an hour and a half.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“Would the time of action depend upon the dose?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“The probabilities are that a large dose would soonest\r\n produce effect. The smallest dose that has produced death has been\r\n between 1-21 gr. and 1-13 gr., or about 1-16 gr.”\r\n\r\nOn _re-examination_ by the _Solicitor-General_, the _Witness_ explained\r\nthat it was when corpses were putrefying that the cadaveric alkaloids\r\nwere produced. He had procured alkaloidal extracts from the urine,\r\nviscera and stomach, and ascertained the effects of them upon mice:\r\nhad made twenty-two experiments this year: there were two cases of\r\nheart disease, and four of the liver, kidneys, spleen, vomit, and six\r\nfrom the urine. He had also, in six instances, taken from the urine\r\nof living persons, and in three from that of healthy dead persons.\r\nThose extracts had no effect on his tongue. He had had many years’\r\nexperience, and certainly never tasted anything like aconitia, and he\r\nhad tried these alkaloidal extracts on the same number of mice without\r\nthe animals suffering except from the puncture. One of these mice,\r\nhe added, he had killed with the _three-thousandths_ of a grain, and\r\n_two-thousandths_ of a grain was always fatal to a mouse. To a question\r\nby the judge, he said “it would make a great difference in the time\r\nwhen the severe symptoms appeared, whether the poison was swallowed\r\ndirectly and whether it came into direct contact with the tongue.” Dr.\r\nDupré confirmed in every detail the statements of his colleague. “In\r\nhis case the effects of tasting the alkaloid from the urine continued\r\nover four hours, and that from the vomit over six hours, though he took\r\nlunch and dinner during that time. In the vomit he did not find any\r\ntrace of quinine which he should have expected had aconitia been given\r\nin conjunction with quinine.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PREVIOUS ACTS OF THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\nSoon after his marriage in 1879, the prisoner set up in practice at\r\nBournemouth, whence in April, 1880, he went for a six months’ trip to\r\nAmerica. Early in 1881, he was in great pecuniary difficulties, and\r\nhad to part with his furniture to pay an execution out of his house,\r\nand again went to America on the 30th of August. Three days before he\r\nsailed, whilst staying with his mother at Ventnor, he visited Percy\r\nJohn at Shanklin, where the boy was staying with the Chapmans, and\r\npromised to return on the Monday, the 29th, before he left England. It\r\nwas supposed that he did so, and it was then, according to the boy’s\r\nstatement before reported, that he gave him a pill, after which he was\r\ntaken ill in much the same way as at Blenheim House in the December\r\nfollowing.[207] From America he returned on the 17th of October, and\r\nafter a visit to Ventnor, where he got a cheque, which was subsequently\r\ndishonoured, cashed by a tradesman (Price Owen), he was in London on\r\nthe 1st of December, staying at the Nelson Hotel, Portland-road. His\r\nactions are now taken up by the following witness, to whom, and to\r\nwhose brother, the prisoner had from time to time advanced money, in\r\nthe case of the brother pawning his surgical instruments and watch, on\r\nthe 24th of November, in order to lend him five pounds.[208]\r\n\r\n_John Law Tulloch_, a student of medicine living in Alma Square, St.\r\nJohn’s Wood, said:—\r\n\r\n “I have known the prisoner for some time. I did not see him till\r\n December of last year from the previous April. I saw him on the 1st\r\n of last December, a Thursday night, at my house. He said he was\r\n staying at Nelson’s Hotel, and was going to Paris the next night.\r\n He had dinner at my house. I went with him to Nelson’s Hotel, and\r\n assisted in packing his luggage. I went with him from the hotel to\r\n Waterloo Station. We had with us a leather case, a handbag, and\r\n a rug. He said he thought he would go first of all to see his\r\n brother-in-law at Wimbledon. We went to Wimbledon together at about\r\n six in the evening.[209] He said he was going up to the school, at\r\n Mr. Bedbrook’s. I waited for him in the public-house opposite. He\r\n came back to me in about twenty minutes. He said that he had seen his\r\n brother-in-law, who was very much worse. He added that he did not\r\n expect him to live long. He said he had seen Mr. Bedbrook, who was a\r\n director of one of the Continental lines, and that gentleman had told\r\n him that it was as well that he should not go that night, as there was\r\n a bad boat on the service. We returned to town, and went together to\r\n the Comedy Theatre in Panton-street. After that we went to Stone’s, a\r\n public-house opposite the theatre, and while we were there he wrote\r\n the cheque produced, on the Wilts and Dorset Bank, dated December 2,\r\n 1881, for 12_l._ 10_s._, payable to J. L. Tulloch. He asked me to\r\n try and obtain the cash for it. We went first to the Adelphi Hotel\r\n in Adam-street, but could not get it cashed there. We then drove to\r\n the Eyre Arms, St. John’s-wood, which is close to where I reside. Mr.\r\n Perrot, the landlord, cashed the cheque, and I gave the money to the\r\n prisoner. I then parted from him, and arranged to meet him on the\r\n following day at the Adelphi Hotel. I saw him there about three or\r\n four in the afternoon. I was to meet him at half-past one, to see him\r\n off by a train at 2.50, but I do not know from what station. He said\r\n that he was too late for the mid-day train, and could not go until\r\n night. I went with him to the Horseshoe to have some refreshment.\r\n When there we found that one of the bags received from the Eyre Arms\r\n contained coppers. We returned to the house and obtained a 5_l._ note\r\n in exchange. He left me there about six. I did not hear of him again\r\n till he was in custody. The cheque was dishonoured. On the 13th of\r\n December he wrote saying the amount would be in my hands very soon,\r\n and he was surprised at my attitude towards, or, rather against\r\n him.”[210]\r\n\r\nOn _cross-examination_, the _witness_ said:—\r\n\r\n “I have said to-day the prisoner said on December 2, ‘the boy is very\r\n much worse, and I don’t think he will last long.’ I do not think he\r\n said anything about his having passed his examination that day. I was\r\n quite sober. I do not owe him money.”\r\n\r\nAt five minutes to seven, on the evening of the 3rd of December,\r\nhe was at Blenheim House telling Mr. Bedbrook he wished to see his\r\nbrother-in-law. The boy was brought into the dining-room, some wine\r\ngot for the prisoner, and some powdered white sugar to cure, as he\r\nsaid, the alcohol in it. He then had with him a leather bag from which\r\nhe took some Dundee cakes and sweets, of which the boy and the master\r\npartook.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bedbrook_ deposed:—\r\n\r\n “About a quarter past 7 the prisoner said to me, ‘Oh, by the way,\r\n when I was in America, I thought of you and your boys, and I thought\r\n what excellent things these capsules would be for the boys to take\r\n nauseous medicine in.’ He produced two boxes of capsules from his bag,\r\n and said, ‘I should like you to try one to see how easily they can be\r\n swallowed.’ I examined them, and put one in my mouth.”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“Was the box wrapped in paper, or was it handed to you\r\n open?”\r\n\r\n _The Witness._—“It was handed to me open.”\r\n\r\n The remainder of the capsules were here produced.\r\n\r\n _Mr. Montagu Williams._—“I do not think they are all of one size.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Poland._—“These are the original capsules.”\r\n\r\n _Witness_ continuing, said—“I swallowed an empty capsule, and it was\r\n very easy to swallow.”\r\n\r\n _The Witness_ continuing, said—“The prisoner took the lids off\r\n both of the boxes. While I was examining a capsule the prisoner was\r\n filling another with sugar, with a little spade spoon. He then, having\r\n apparently filled it with sugar, said, ‘If you shake it the medicine\r\n will come down to one end.’ He then handed the capsule to the boy\r\n Percy John, who was sitting on his right, about a yard from him. In\r\n doing so he said, ‘Here, Percy; you are a swell pill taker; take this,\r\n and show Mr. Bedbrook how easy it is to swallow.’ Percy John then put\r\n the capsule in his mouth as far back as he could, and at one gulp it\r\n was gone. I remarked to him, ‘That is soon gone, my boy.’ The prisoner\r\n then said, ‘I must be going now,’ and I then looked at the time-table\r\n to see the next train for London. It was then 7.20 or thereabouts,\r\n and I told him the next train left at 7.21, and advised him to go at\r\n once or he would miss his train. Previous to this I had asked him to\r\n remain a little longer, until the 7.50 train. He said, ‘I cannot, as\r\n I have to catch a train at eight o’clock at London Bridge, _en route_\r\n to the Continent.’ He said he was going to Florence, _viâ_ Paris.\r\n Passing through the drawing-room I remarked to him that I thought the\r\n curvature of the spine of the deceased was getting worse. He observed\r\n on that occasion that he did not think the boy would last long. I did\r\n not make any reply to that. He then left the house at about 21 or 22\r\n minutes past seven o’clock. He left behind the two boxes of capsules.\r\n I placed them on the dining-room waggon.”\r\n\r\n _Question._—“From the time Percy John had swallowed the capsule how\r\n many minutes elapsed before the prisoner said, ‘I must be going now’?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“He said it within five minutes. After the prisoner left\r\n the house I returned to the dining-room, where Percy John was. When I\r\n got back deceased said, ‘I feel as if I had an attack of heartburn.’\r\n I think after that I returned to my guests. He was reading the\r\n newspapers.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Montagu Williams_ objected to the statements of the deceased being\r\nput in evidence.\r\n\r\n_The Judge_ said that evidence as to symptoms could be received when\r\nmade by the deceased.\r\n\r\n _Examination continued._—“I returned to him in five minutes. He said,\r\n ‘I feel as I felt when my brother-in-law had given me a quinine pill\r\n at Shanklin.’ He said he would like to go to bed. I gave orders that\r\n he should go to bed. Mr. Bell carried him upstairs.”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“At what time was this?”\r\n\r\n _Answer._—“Between eight and nine.”\r\n\r\nThe fatal attack now came on as previously described. In the box with\r\nthe capsules were some little pills, and in the boy’s own box in his\r\nbedroom a small box of quinine powders, and another with two pills\r\nwrapped in tinfoil.[211] In the previous year, when the prisoner was\r\nin America, Mr. Bedbrook had received from him a box of pills, with a\r\nletter, saying that “he had met some one in America suffering from the\r\nsame complaint as the boy, who had derived great benefit from taking\r\nmedicine similar to that now sent, and requesting Mr. Bedbrook to see\r\nthe boy take the medicine.” “I afterwards,” said the witness, “gave\r\nthe boy one of the pills, and next morning he complained of being very\r\nunwell. At that time the box was in his bedroom, and Percy John said,\r\n‘I will take no more of them.’ I thereupon took the pills downstairs,\r\nand until the box produced was found, was under the impression that I\r\nhad thrown it away.”[212]\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF ACONITIA BY THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Charles Albert Smith_, a chemist at Ventnor, proved that on\r\nthe 28th of August, 1881, the prisoner purchased of him 3 grains\r\nof sulphate of atropine, and 2 grains of aconitia, and that he had\r\nlabelled the latter “Aconitine, poison.” As he had previously made\r\nup prescriptions for the prisoner, and knew him as a medical man, he\r\nsold the poison to him without hesitation. Aconitia, he believed, was\r\ncommonly used for neuralgia and cancer, to relieve the palpitations in\r\nheart disease, and as a diuretic in dropsy.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of November, 1881, the prisoner asked for 2 grains of\r\naconitia at Messrs. Allen & Hanbury’s, of Plough-court, Lombard-street;\r\nand as the assistant, on reference to the Medical Directory, found the\r\nprisoner’s name as a medical man practising at Bournemouth, he sold\r\nthem to him without further precaution than labelling it “Poison.”\r\nOn the evidence of this witness, Mr. Dodd, a difficulty arose, from\r\nhis having at first entertained the impression that it was “atropia”\r\nwhich he had sold. The price of this drug to a medical man would have\r\nbeen only threepence a grain, whilst that of aconitia would be 1_s._\r\n3_d._[213] In the petty-cash book of the day, among entries of sales\r\nmarked “C”—the sign that they were sold to a medical man—was one of\r\n2_s._ 6_d._, but none of 3_d._; and Mr. Dodd, after consulting with the\r\nother assistant who was present at the sale, became convinced that it\r\nwas “aconitia,” and not “atropia,” which he had sold to the prisoner.\r\n“There is also,” he said, “a difference in colour, atropia being white,\r\nand aconitia yellowish-white.”\r\n\r\nA previous attempt to purchase aconitia was proved by Mr.\r\nStilling,[214] an assistant of Messrs. Bell & Co., Oxford-street,\r\non the 20th of November. Twice before that day the prisoner had had\r\nprescriptions made up there, which he wrote in the shop, and marked as\r\nfor his own use. These contained morphia and atropia, but at the bottom\r\nof the second of these prescriptions he had written, “Digitaline, pure,\r\n5 grains.”\r\n\r\n _By the Judge._—“He told me he practised at Bournemouth.”\r\n\r\n _By Mr. Poland._—“He led us to infer that he was accustomed to\r\n prescribe this digitaline for internal use. It is the active principle\r\n of foxglove, and is a poison. While he was in the shop I looked at\r\n our stock of digitaline, and found it more coloured than I expected.\r\n I told him that, and said I would provide him some fresh from the\r\n manufacturer in a few days. I did that because he had laid stress on\r\n its being pure. He did not say when he would call again, but in a\r\n few days. Dr. Lamson himself then struck out the lower part of the\r\n prescription as to the digitaline. All the rest was made up—morphia\r\n and the sulphate of atropia. He waited in the shop while it was made\r\n up, and paid 2_s._ 9_d._ for it. In a few days he called again; it was\r\n after the 20th of November. He then asked for one grain of aconitia\r\n for internal use. I knew it was poison, and I recommended him to\r\n procure it where he was better known. Nothing more was said, and he\r\n left the shop. I believe he wrote an order for one grain of aconitia\r\n in the shop, and I believe he tore it up himself. Except seeing him on\r\n the 11th and the 16th I knew nothing of him before.”\r\n\r\n _By Mr. Williams._—“He told me on the 11th that he was staying at\r\n Nelson’s Hotel, in Portland Street. I cannot swear that there was a\r\n written order for the aconitia. I believed that when I went from the\r\n shop for my fellow-assistant, Dr. Lamson wrote the order; and then\r\n when we returned he tore it up. I have not said anything about that\r\n order before to-day, because I was not asked. Only the atropia and\r\n morphia were bought on both occasions.”\r\n\r\n _Re-examined._—“When he asked me for the aconitia, knowing it was a\r\n potent poison, I went to consult a fellow-assistant, and then he wrote\r\n the order, as I believe.”\r\n\r\nIt may be noted here that the larger quinine powders in the box which\r\nwere found to be pure were proved to have been purchased of Mr.\r\nLittlefield, a chemist at Ventnor, on the 13th of October, 1880; that\r\nhe knew nothing of the smaller ones, which were proved by Dr. Stevenson\r\nto contain aconitia, and that he never kept that drug in his shop. In\r\nthis he was confirmed by his assistant, Mr. Bright, who identified his\r\nown handwriting on the box in which they had been sold. The smaller\r\nquinine powders were not traced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURRENDER OF THE PRISONER.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of December, the prisoner called at Scotland Yard and saw\r\nInspector Butcher, who gave the following account of the interview:—\r\n\r\n “When the prisoner came there and saw me, he said, ‘Mr. Butcher?’\r\n and I replied, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘My name is Lamson. I am Dr. Lamson,\r\n whose name has been mentioned in connection with the death at\r\n Wimbledon.’ I asked him to be seated, and he continued, ‘I have\r\n called to see what is to be done about it. I considered it best to\r\n do so. I read the account in the public papers in Paris, and came\r\n over this morning. I have only just now arrived in London. I am very\r\n unwell, and much upset about this matter, and not in a fit state at\r\n all to have undertaken this journey.’ I then communicated with Chief\r\n Superintendent Williamson, who said to the prisoner, ‘You will have\r\n to remain a time.’ I remained with him. His wife was present. He\r\n conversed on various subjects for some time, and then he said, ‘Where\r\n is the delay? I thought I would come here and leave my address. I am\r\n going into the country to Chichester, so that you will know where to\r\n find me, and I will attend the inquest. I have travelled from Paris\r\n _viâ_ Havre and Southampton. I went over _viâ_ Dover and Calais.’\r\n After this I again saw Chief Superintendent Williamson, who called the\r\n prisoner into another room. I said, ‘Dr. Lamson, this case has been\r\n fully considered, and it has been decided to charge you with causing\r\n the death of Percy John. I therefore take you into custody, and\r\n charge you with causing the death of Percy Malcolm John, at Blenheim\r\n House, Wimbledon, on the 3rd of December instant.’ He said, ‘Very\r\n well; do you think bail will be accepted? I hope the matter will be\r\n kept as quiet as possible, for the sake of my relations.’ I told him\r\n he would now be taken to Wandsworth police-court, and the question\r\n of bail would rest with the magistrate. I conveyed him in a cab to\r\n the Wandsworth police-station. On the way he said, ‘You will have my\r\n father here in a day or two. I hope it will be stated that I came to\r\n Scotland Yard voluntarily. I came from Paris on purpose.’ I said,\r\n ‘Certainly.’”\r\n\r\nOn searching the box which he had left at Euston Station among various\r\narticles, chiefly of plate, a medical memorandum book was found, from\r\nwhich the Solicitor-General read an extract on the “effects of acrid\r\nvegetable poisons,” and then closed the case for the prosecution.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Montagu Williams_, having previously had the letter read from the\r\nHome Office, refusing to allow an independent analysis of the contents\r\nof the body on the part of the prisoner, then commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nOf the speech for the defence, which lasted the greater part of two\r\ndays, and dealt with the case with extreme minuteness, it will be\r\nsufficient to give a summary, especially as its leading points were\r\nremarked upon so fully in the charge of the learned Judge.\r\n\r\nOn the question whether the death of the boy was from poison, _Mr.\r\nMontagu Williams_, necessarily laid great stress on the admitted\r\ninability of the scientific witnesses to rely on any other test than\r\nthat of taste. “Scientifically,” he said, “it was a leap in the dark,\r\nand they had to traverse a region of science up to the present moment\r\nunexplored. Who knows about aconite? and echo answers who? What was\r\nit? The root of monkshood. Aconite was one form, and aconitia was the\r\nactive principle of that form: and up to the present moment, with the\r\nexception of one reported case, there was not a single authority on the\r\nsubject.” Pursuing this subject, he said:—\r\n\r\n “The first medical witness called was Dr. Berry, who on the night of\r\n December 3rd was visiting at Blenheim House, where he saw the poor\r\n boy until his death, and observed all the symptoms under which the\r\n unfortunate lad suffered. What were they? The lad told him that he\r\n was suffering from heartburn, and where was the symptom of heartburn\r\n in the administration of aconite in the evidence of the experts that\r\n had been brought before them? What medical gentleman had said that\r\n heartburn was a sign of aconitia poisoning? The poor lad was found\r\n vomiting, and Dr. Berry and another medical man, Dr. Little, treated\r\n him for irritation of the stomach. Neither of them treated him for,\r\n or thought of, poisoning. The boy was taken from the bath-room, where\r\n he was found, to the bed from which he never rose, and from first to\r\n last all the symptoms were those of irritation of the stomach. From\r\n nine o’clock to past eleven no attempt was made to use the stomach\r\n pump; and if the medical gentlemen thought poison had been taken, they\r\n never used anything to relieve him, or what might have saved him. If\r\n poison was in the minds of these medical men, why did they not treat\r\n him for such? It was clear, therefore, there was no thought of poison;\r\n and Dr. Berry admitted in evidence that it never occurred to him that\r\n it was so until the _post-mortem_ examination. He said he then thought\r\n the death was from alkaloid poisoning. It was the duty of him (Mr.\r\n Williams) to cross-examine him on vegetable alkaloids. What was his\r\n knowledge? His knowledge was a blank, and he admitted he knew nothing\r\n of vegetable alkaloids. Therefore, the first expert witness called for\r\n the prosecution—who had, moreover, the benefit of seeing the symptoms\r\n in life—broke down altogether. It was his case that the theories of\r\n the prosecution were of the most speculative character. Dr. Little\r\n differed somewhat, and said, ‘We came to the conclusion that the boy\r\n was dying from a vegetable poison an hour before his death,’ while Dr.\r\n Berry said it was not until the _post-mortem_ examination that they\r\n thought anything of the sort. Dr. Little says he read about vegetable\r\n alkaloids in his student days. Both those gentlemen, who give the\r\n opinion that death resulted from vegetable alkaloids, knew nothing\r\n whatever about the subject. Then they had Mr. Bond, a gentleman of\r\n great scientific attainments, well known in these courts, who gave\r\n the results of the _post-mortem_ examination, and he (the learned\r\n counsel) thought it would not be straining the imagination too much\r\n to say that that gentleman gave the first idea of poisoning in the\r\n matter. Mr. Bond said he came to the conclusion that death resulted\r\n from a vegetable alkaloid, and again the same line of questions and\r\n answers followed. Mr. Bond admitted he had never known a case of\r\n such poisoning. And so the jury were asked to form a verdict on the\r\n evidence of two persons who had seen the symptoms of the deceased in\r\n life, and were entirely ignorant of the signs of vegetable alkaloid\r\n poisoning, and of Mr. Bond, who was not present, and who admitted he\r\n was also ignorant upon the subject. They were asked to give a verdict\r\n on which an existence hung, and to say they had no doubt whatever that\r\n aconitia was in the body. He could only say up to that time there\r\n was not one single piece of evidence that the boy died by aconitia\r\n poisoning.”\r\n\r\nPassing thence to the evidence of Doctors Stevenson and Dupré, whose\r\ntests, the former said, “rested on his taste, on the effects of the\r\nsolutions on the mice and his reading,” he called the attention of\r\nthe jury to Dr. Stevenson’s admission that the results of most of\r\nthese tests were consistent with other causes, though consistent\r\nwith aconitia, and ridiculed the effects on the mice as confirmatory\r\ntests, quoting the remarks of Lord Coleridge that tests upon animals\r\nwere always found to be most unreliable, and of Professor Tidy, “that\r\nalthough useful at arriving at results, they sometimes failed, and\r\nwere not reliable.” “If they used their common sense they must see\r\nthat that must be so. So delicate was the constitution of a mouse that\r\none of those experimented on had died because the injecting needle had\r\nbeen stuck in a quarter of an inch too far. Mice would sometimes die\r\nfrom fright, and also from the injection of water, and yet because\r\nthese mice spoken of died in five minutes they were asked to say\r\nthat they died of aconitia poisoning.” As to the test of taste, Dr.\r\nStevenson had admitted “that it was like some other alkaloids, and not\r\nlike others.” The question of the production of cadaveric alkaloids\r\nwas still _sub judice_. He was prevented, by the refusal of the Home\r\nOffice, to allow experts on the prisoner’s behalf to be present at the\r\nanalytical examination, from calling scientific witnesses to rebut—“an\r\nact that was trifling with life—a beautiful bit of red-tapeism; and,\r\nif it was contrary to all practice, the sooner it was done away with\r\nthe better.”\r\n\r\nOn the second point, whether if aconitia was given, it was given by the\r\nprisoner, _Mr. Montagu Williams_, after alluding to the way in which\r\nhis admitted poverty had been pressed against the prisoner, called the\r\nattention of the jury to the facilities the prisoner would have had of\r\npoisoning his brother-in-law during the boy’s visit at his house in\r\nthe summer, or his projected visit at Christmas; to the fact that the\r\nsupposed attempt was made in the full light of gas, and in the presence\r\nof both the master and the victim; that there was no proof that he had\r\nbrought a capsule ready charged with poison, and that he must have\r\nmanipulated one before their eyes, and that it was not by his request\r\nthat powdered white sugar was brought. “What was there to prevent lump\r\nsugar being brought?” As to the pills found with the capsules,\r\n\r\n “Where did they come from? No pills were given to the boy by the\r\n prisoner, for Mr. Bedbrook was present the whole time and no mention\r\n was made of pills. Where was the boy all the afternoon? In the room\r\n downstairs, and able to move about, though this was studiously\r\n concealed by everyone from Blenheim House. In this room was the box\r\n in which two pills were afterwards found, one of which was charged\r\n with aconitia. Were there other pills in that box? It was known that\r\n Percy John kept medicine unknown to everyone in the establishment,\r\n although it was against the rules of the school; it being the duty\r\n of the master to administer all medicine. The poor fellow was called\r\n ‘the swell pill taker,’ and what was more likely than that, with the\r\n fascination of the new capsules before him, he should have taken a\r\n pill for the heartburn from which he was suffering. Did he do so? It\r\n was suggested that these pills were some sent by the prisoner, but\r\n Mr. Bedbrook had exploded that idea. He swore that he thought he had\r\n destroyed those referred to, but at any rate he had never given them\r\n back to the prisoner. Now did these four or five pills, found on the\r\n table, come from the box? Was there any evidence to show that the boy\r\n did not carry pills in his pocket, and took one in consequence of the\r\n heartburn? What did the prosecution mean? Did they mean to say that\r\n there was a pill hidden in the capsule? If the boy had thought of\r\n such a thing, would he not have asked Mr. Bedbrook or Banbury whether\r\n they felt in a similar state? The boy was in the possession of all\r\n his faculties when questioned, but he did not say one word about the\r\n capsules.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Montagu Williams_ then alluded to the admission of Mr. Whalley\r\nthat poisons were occasionally left in the house after the chemical\r\nlectures, and to the probability that so large a dose of aconitia\r\nas was assumed to have been given would have acted sooner, as Dr.\r\nStevenson admitted that 1/21 of a grain might kill, and 1/13 would\r\ncertainly have a fatal effect. As for the medical note-book found in\r\nthe prisoner’s possession, he reminded the jury of Lord Campbell’s\r\nopinion in Palmer’s case that nothing was more natural for a\r\nprofessional man, and added, “It had no more bearing on the case than\r\nif ‘Russell on Crimes’ had been found in his own possession, on a\r\ncharge of murder.”\r\n\r\nOn the proof of the purchase of aconitia at Allen’s, he begged them to\r\nnote, that on the 5th of December the police commenced their enquiries,\r\non the 6th the assistants at Allen’s communicated with them, saying\r\nthat the prisoner had purchased atropia, and that it was not until\r\nafter that that they changed their opinion and were convinced that\r\nit was aconitia. It was true that no entry of 3_d._ was found in the\r\ncash book, but there was one of 8_d._, and one of the chemists had\r\ndeposed that the wholesale price of atropia, to a medical man, was\r\n4_d._ a grain. But even if it was aconitia that the prisoner then\r\npurchased, it was only natural for him so to do, as he was suffering\r\nfrom rheumatism, of which it was a cure. Again, though they knew where\r\nthe larger quinine powders, which were not poisoned, came from, it had\r\nnot been proved whence the smaller came, which it was the duty of the\r\nprosecution to have done. “Oddly enough, they were tied up with a piece\r\nof string, a most unusual thing coming from a chemist’s shop. They had\r\ntraced twelve quinine powders, but they had failed to trace the pills\r\nsent from America which Mr. Bedbrook swore were not given back to the\r\ndeceased. He, Mr. Williams, could not say where the smaller powders\r\ncame from, nor where the pills came from. The burden was not on him to\r\ndo so, but on the prosecution.”\r\n\r\nTurning then to the evidence of the visit to the boy at Shanklin,\r\n_Mr. Williams_ said he would deal with that important episode most\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n “Albert Smith,” he said, “proved that on the 28th of August he sold to\r\n prisoner three grains of atropia and one grain of aconitia, charging\r\n 4_d._ per grain for the first and 1_s._ 6_d._ per grain for the last\r\n named. The suggestion on the part of the prosecution was that in the\r\n month of August the assassin was at work and an attempt was made on\r\n the life of the lad. In his judgment he would make that melt into the\r\n thinnest of thin air. The 28th of August was a Sunday, and on the\r\n previous day Mr. and Mrs. Chapman and the boy arrived. At that time\r\n there were four persons of the name of Lamson residing at the Isle of\r\n Wight—namely, the prisoner’s father and mother, and himself and his\r\n wife. On the 27th of August they met the boy at the station, and went\r\n to Mrs. Jolliffe’s lodgings, and here again there appeared a kindness\r\n and solicitude for the deceased. The 28th was Sunday, and it was said\r\n that he bought aconitia on that day, and that he was present on the\r\n 29th, and in order to prove it it was said that a parcel was left at\r\n the station in the name of Lamson, when there were four persons on the\r\n island named Lamson. It was further said that the deceased suffered\r\n from illness after taking something given to him by the prisoner, and\r\n from that they assumed it was aconitia bought at the shop of Mr. Smith\r\n that he had taken. The proof was all the other way, as the symptoms\r\n upon which the prosecution relied all through the case were not those\r\n which could be assigned to aconitia, while he recovered within a few\r\n hours. Beyond that, it was shown that he suffered from indigestion,\r\n especially by the fact that although he dined at one o’clock on the\r\n day of his death, undigested food was found in the vomit at nine\r\n o’clock at night. The prisoner purchased the atropia and aconitia on\r\n the 28th of August, he was to leave for America on the 30th. This\r\n mixture was the very thing he would have taken, and the very time he\r\n would have bought it for the purpose of going on the voyage. The dates\r\n exactly suited.”\r\n\r\nCounsel’s explanation of the story told by the prisoner to the witness\r\nTulloch was ingenious.\r\n\r\n “The prisoner did not deny that he went down to Wimbledon on December\r\n 2 with Tulloch, but if he contemplated assassination then would\r\n he have been likely to have taken Tulloch with him? That was an\r\n observation worthy of some note. He would try and imagine a state\r\n of things to have existed, which was not impossible but more than\r\n probable. It was admitted that upon the 2nd of December the boy had\r\n been passing an examination. It was also admitted the first thing the\r\n prisoner was greeted with on the 3rd was, ‘I am glad you did not come\r\n yesterday.’ When he went down on the 2nd what was more likely than\r\n that he met some one, perhaps one of the boys, for it was a holiday,\r\n who told him it was an examination day, and he therefore postponed his\r\n visit until the next day? All the importance of this visit depended\r\n on the evidence of a man who had altered his evidence as originally\r\n given, and who, it was suggested, was on that night the worse for\r\n liquor.”\r\n\r\nWith the remarks that the flight of the prisoner to Paris, where he\r\ncould have been arrested, and his return to England and surrender to\r\nthe police, were not the acts of a guilty man; that, to obtain the\r\npecuniary gain from the boy’s death, the prisoner must have applied to\r\nthe Court of Chancery, and if there had been suspicion of foul play\r\nwould find, instead of receiving £1,500, the hangman’s halter round his\r\nneck, and a fervid appeal on behalf of the wife who had stood by him in\r\nCourt, and his young child, _Mr. Montagu Williams_ concluded his minute\r\nand able survey of the case against his client.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPLY.\r\n\r\nThe _Solicitor-General_, in his comparatively brief reply, directed\r\nthe attention of the jury to the following points. He admitted that,\r\nin this case, they had to traverse a branch of science but little\r\nknown, that little was known of aconitia, and everything speculation.\r\nHe urged, however, that “that argument, whilst fair, might be pressed\r\ntoo far, as then a man desirous of taking life had only to use some\r\npoison but little known, and then to ask that he should not be rendered\r\nliable for the results of his crime. They found, no doubt, from time\r\nto time, fresh materials used for the commission of crime. If a man\r\nfrom his knowledge used a poison little known and little used, still\r\nscience, with unerring precision, and working as fast as him, could\r\nbring the crime to light.” The idea of death from natural causes had\r\napparently been abandoned by the prisoner’s counsel, so that it was\r\nimpossible to doubt that it was due to poison, and what that poison\r\nwas must rest on the evidence of the scientific witnesses, “the first\r\nin their profession, of the highest skill, not called in to prop up\r\nany theory, but to frame an independent opinion. The presence of a\r\nthird party would not have been likely to assist the analysis, while on\r\nthe other hand it might have led to difficulty, and even mistake.” He\r\ndisputed the correctness of the quotation from Dr. Tidy. What he really\r\ndid say, was, “Experiments on animals may furnish us with much useful\r\ninformation in cases of suspected poisoning, but their value must not\r\nbe over-estimated.” In this case they were only used to strengthen\r\nthe evidence from taste. “The two tests must be used together. It\r\nwas their combined force that drove home to the mind the conviction\r\nthat Dr. Stevenson was right when he said that what he found in the\r\nbody was aconitia, and nothing but aconitia.” “As to the cadaveric\r\nalkaloids, they had in evidence that they were only produced along with\r\nputrefaction, and that their results on animals were totally different\r\nfrom those of the extracts from the boy’s body. Would they not say that\r\nDr. Stevenson’s experiments had been conducted in every way to exclude\r\nerror, and must they not, looking at the whole of the scientific\r\nevidence, accept his judgment?”\r\n\r\nAs to the possibility of the boy himself obtaining this poison, it\r\nwas fenced round with such safeguards that not even a medical man,\r\nunless personally known, could obtain it without a record being kept.\r\nHis story about the visit to Wimbledon was pure invention, and the\r\nexplanation of it by counsel ingenious, and no more. Falsehood seemed\r\nto have been uttered by him at every turn. The taking Mr. Tulloch with\r\nhim was a mere blind: his return and surrender intended to divert\r\nsuspicion. Had he remained in France he must have been arrested, and,\r\nif he had no money, he was compelled to return to England.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGE’S CHARGE.\r\n\r\nIn his charge to the jury, after pointing out that the two points to\r\nwhich they had to direct their attention were whether the boy died\r\nfrom poison or a natural disease, and if by poison, whether it was\r\nadministered to him by the prisoner, Sir Henry Hawkins alluded to the\r\nalleged motive—the prospect of an accession of fortune at the time\r\nwhen the prisoner was in great pecuniary difficulties—and the fact\r\nthat until the day of his death the deceased, though a cripple, was\r\nfree from any mortal disease. Then, after referring to the details of\r\nthe prisoner’s visit to the boy on the 3rd of December, the judge made\r\nthe following remarks on the results of the chemical analysis, and the\r\ncomments of Mr. Williams on them:—\r\n\r\n “The presence of morphia was, he said, accounted for, as it had been\r\n injected beneath the skin for the purpose of allaying the pain. With\r\n regard to the dark fluid in the stomach, it contained, according\r\n to the evidence of Dr. Stevenson, traces of food, an apple, and a\r\n raisin, and from it an alkaloidal extract was obtained; on applying\r\n which to the tongue a slight taste of aconitia was produced. The\r\n sensation extended to the lip, although the extract did not touch\r\n it. The sensation was a burning, tingling, numbing one difficult to\r\n define. Salivation and a desire to expectorate were produced—there\r\n was a sensation at the back of the throat, a swelling up: this was\r\n followed by a peculiar seared sensation of the tongue, as though a\r\n hot iron had been passed over it or strong caustic. Experiments were\r\n made with extracts from the liver, spleen, and kidneys, from the\r\n dark fluid, and from the stomach itself, and within nine minutes mice\r\n showed symptoms of poisoning, and died in about twenty-two minutes\r\n afterwards. The same sensation, in fact, was produced on the mice as\r\n had been produced on his own tongue previously. In the urine there\r\n was a taste of aconitia, which brought on a sickening and a burning\r\n sensation. Mr. Montagu Williams had said that the experiments upon\r\n mice were hardly a test as to what the effect of the extract would be\r\n upon human beings. Granted; but they were about the only tests that\r\n could properly be made, and they proved the presence of aconitia.\r\n The drug, Dr. Stevenson said, produced a sensation to the tongue and\r\n throat which was unmistakable, and its property of killing was proved\r\n by its test upon the mice. Could they believe Dr. Stevenson mistaken\r\n about that, it was asked—were there not other vegetable alkaloids?\r\n There were; and Dr. Stevenson said they all had peculiar tastes\r\n which differed from that of aconitia. He further said that, having\r\n made himself acquainted with between 50 and 80 vegetable alkaloids,\r\n aconitia differed in taste from any of them. The learned Judge\r\n proceeded to read the evidence given by Dr. Stevenson as to the action\r\n of the extract and of prepared aconitia on the mice. Dr. Stevenson had\r\n minutely examined the vomit to endeavour to trace some of the fibre of\r\n monkshood from which aconite was extracted, and which, as was known,\r\n had sometimes been mistaken for horse radish, but not a particle could\r\n he find. But he obtained all the symptoms of aconitia upon his tongue,\r\n and death resulted in 15½ minutes when a small quantity was injected\r\n into the back of a mouse. He gave it as his opinion that 1-13th of a\r\n grain was sufficient to kill, and that he found enough aconitia in\r\n the stomach to cause the death of two persons. Dr. Stevenson had been\r\n submitted to a severe cross-examination, and it would be for the jury\r\n to say whether they believed that he had really found aconitia. Mr.\r\n Williams had said they were embarking in a new region in aconitia\r\n poisoning. It might be they were not very learned in it, though they\r\n would doubtless advance as fresh experiments were made and fresh tests\r\n applied. At present it was true there was no chemical test. That was\r\n admitted. Mr. Williams, in the course of his cross-examination, had\r\n spoken of phosphoric acid, but Dr. Stevenson said that only applied\r\n to foreign aconitia, and not to Morson’s English preparation. They\r\n had before them the explanation of Dr. Stevenson. It stood for what\r\n it was worth, and it was for them to say if he was correct, after the\r\n experiments he had made, in saying that he had found aconitia. Dr.\r\n Stevenson had explained the only tests, physiological and otherwise,\r\n to trace aconitia, and had formed his opinion that death arose from\r\n that substance. With reference to cadaveric alkaloids, Dr. Stevenson\r\n did not admit that poisonous cadaveric alkaloids were to be found in\r\n the human body. He did not dispute there were cadaveric alkaloids, but\r\n he disputed their being poisonous. He did not say they were not so;\r\n it was still an open question. The result of the 22 experiments he\r\n had made by tasting cadaveric alkaloids never gave him any taste like\r\n aconitia, and in only one case did death ensue to a mouse experimented\r\n upon, which was where the little animal’s spine was injured by the\r\n needle used for the injection. Another circumstance spoken to by Dr.\r\n Dupré was that no trace of quinine was found in the vomit, but that\r\n might be due to the fact that a portion of the vomit was thrown away.\r\n Upon the testimony as to the cause of death the prosecution said that\r\n there was no possibility of accounting for death by natural causes,\r\n and it was for the jury to say whether the death was from aconitia.”\r\n\r\nThen going through the evidence of the prisoner’s pecuniary\r\nembarrassments, he alluded to the sending of the pills from America as\r\nshowing that if he had entertained the design of poisoning the boy, he\r\nhad done so long before the fatal act.\r\n\r\n “Mischief, it was held, had been concocted long before the lad died.\r\n Prisoner went to America in the early part of 1881, and returned about\r\n the 2nd July, and whilst there, as Mr. Bedbrook had said, he sent over\r\n a box of pills, saying that he had found them to be useful in the\r\n complaint under which the boy suffered. The boy had one pill given\r\n to him, and Mr. Bedbrook believed that as he did not like it he took\r\n the box and threw the remainder away. In the month of August aconitia\r\n was, it was said, administered to the boy whilst at Shanklin, and that\r\n it came from powders contained in a box. These circumstances did not\r\n lead to death, but they indicated, as was contended, the desire of\r\n the prisoner to do mischief to the unfortunate boy. It was a question\r\n certainly whether the pills given were the same as those which the\r\n prisoner sent over from America, and which Mr. Bedbrook believed\r\n he had thrown away. In the bedroom at Wimbledon was found a box of\r\n quinine powders—six large and fourteen small ones. Eleven of the\r\n small ones were of pure quinine, but three of them were more or less\r\n mixed with aconitia. Dr. Stevenson said that one of the powders—No.\r\n 16—contained 1 and eight-tenths of a grain, and that the proportion\r\n of quinine to aconitia in it was as 83 to 96. Dr. Stevenson tested it,\r\n and the sensation upon his tongue lasted three hours. One-fiftieth\r\n part of a grain was tried on a mouse, and it was dead in six minutes\r\n and a half afterwards. They would judge how fatal a quantity was in\r\n the powder if they bore in mind what they had been told as to the\r\n fatality of 1-13th part of a grain. In Nos. 17 and 19 there was some\r\n trace of aconitia, but in neither of them anything like the quantity\r\n in No. 16. The box in which those powders were found had been in\r\n common use, and one of the boys had actually taken one of them.\r\n Anybody, of course, might have taken one of the eleven pure powders,\r\n and the lad himself—with the exception of once, at Shanklin—had\r\n never shown any symptoms that might be considered anything like\r\n aconitia poisoning. No doubt three of the powders did contain aconitia\r\n in considerable quantities, and they had to consider how did the\r\n aconitia come into them? Among other things found in the boy’s box\r\n were two pills in a tin pill-box. A tin pill-box, it was suggested,\r\n was sent over from America. Mr. Williams said that Mr. Bedbrook stated\r\n he had destroyed them, but the fact remained that the box with the two\r\n pills—one of which was poisoned—were found in the play-box. It was\r\n true there was no evidence that the box was the same, but Mr. Bedbrook\r\n said it resembled that which he received from America, but which he\r\n said he thought he had destroyed.”\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Pardon me, my Lord, but Mr. Bedbrook, I think, never\r\n said he destroyed the box; he said he had destroyed the pills.”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“ I think he said he threw them away.” His Lordship\r\n referred to his notes, and said that Mr. Bedbrook in his evidence\r\n stated that he took the box downstairs, and was under the impression\r\n he threw it away. When he saw the box, however, it appeared to him\r\n exactly like that which came from America, and the pills were also\r\n exactly like them.\r\n\r\n _Mr. Williams._—“Mr. Bedbrook said he never gave the pills back to\r\n the deceased boy.”\r\n\r\n _The Judge._—“That is so. He said he was under the impression he had\r\n thrown them away. It was said that the boy could not get aconitia\r\n himself, but though he could not do so the prisoner could. Next they\r\n heard what had occurred at Shanklin in October, 1881. The prisoner\r\n was going to America, and sailed on the 30th August. On the 27th of\r\n that month Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, with the boy, went to Shanklin, and\r\n found on the platform to meet them the prisoner and his wife. They\r\n had some conversation, and prisoner promised to call on Monday, 29th,\r\n to say ‘Good-bye.’ On the night of Sunday, the 28th, they had it\r\n on the testimony of Mr. Smith, a chemist, that the prisoner called\r\n on him and bought, amongst other things, three grains of atropia\r\n and one grain of aconitia. It was endeavoured to be shown on the\r\n part of the prosecution that he had called pursuant to his promise\r\n on the 29th, and in evidence of that it was sought to produce the\r\n cloak-room book of the railway station. On the 29th, however, the boy\r\n was unquestionably unwell. It was clear that on the 27th the prisoner\r\n saw him, and said he would call again on the Monday, but there was\r\n no direct evidence that he did, although he bought aconitia on the\r\n 28th, which Mr. Williams said might have been bought with an innocent\r\n motive, as the prisoner at the time was suffering from neuralgia.”\r\n\r\nReviewing then the prisoner’s conduct in London, and the story invented\r\nby him about his pretended visit to the boy on the 2nd of December,\r\n“which,” he said, “did not amount to much, but must be taken, with the\r\nother circumstances of the case, to show that the prisoner’s word was\r\nnot to be relied on,” the learned judge then referred to the incidents\r\nof the fatal night. As to the two boxes of capsules, he continued:—\r\n\r\n “The prosecution suggested that these two boxes of capsules were\r\n brought by the prisoner, but they did not suggest there was poison\r\n in any of them. They were clearly innocent capsules, as two of them\r\n did no harm either to Mr. Bedbrook or to the lad Banbury, each of\r\n whom swallowed one. What the prosecution suggested, however, was that\r\n whilst Mr. Bedbrook was examining the capsule he had taken from the\r\n box, the prisoner took another, in which there was aconitia, from\r\n another box, and that over that aconitia he put in the sugar, and then\r\n administered it to the boy. That was the suggestion made. They asked\r\n for those facts to be put together—the boy was in as good health as\r\n he ordinarily was, in as good spirits as usual, having neither eaten\r\n nor partaken of anything in which there was a suggestion of poison\r\n during the day, and yet within half-an-hour, or less, of seeing the\r\n prisoner and swallowing the capsule he was taken ill. The cake, the\r\n sweets, and the capsule were all three given him by the prisoner, and\r\n within a short time he showed the first symptoms described, viz.,\r\n heartburn, which was followed rapidly by painful sensations, and the\r\n contraction of the throat, retching, vomiting, agony, and raving to\r\n the time of death. On these facts the prosecution asked them to come\r\n to the conclusion that he not only died by aconitia, but by aconitia\r\n administered to him by the prisoner, it being clear that no other\r\n person administered anything to him during the prisoner’s visit. The\r\n prosecution contended farther that they had shown the prisoner to be\r\n possessed of aconitia, upon the evidence of two purchases of aconitia\r\n by him, one from the chemist at Ventnor on the 28th August, and the\r\n other about the 20th November at Allen and Hanbury’s, in Plough Court.\r\n\r\nThen again placing before the jury the two questions he had referred to\r\nin the opening of his charge, and warning them not to allow sympathy\r\neither for the poor boy or the prisoner to bias their decision, Sir\r\nHenry Hawkins left the case in their hands.\r\n\r\nIn less than three-quarters of an hour the jury returned a verdict of\r\n“Guilty.” When called upon as usual to say why judgment should not be\r\npassed upon him, the prisoner, standing with arms folded, in a loud\r\nvoice, “protested his innocence before God,” and with very few words,\r\nthe learned judge pronounced sentence of death.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF LAMSON’S STATE OF MIND.\r\n\r\nWithin a short time after the conviction of the prisoner, Mr. Lowell,\r\nthe American Minister, by the instruction of President Arthur,\r\nrequested the Home Secretary to suspend the execution, on the faith\r\nof a statement from the United States Attorney-General that evidence\r\nbearing on the state of mind of the prisoner, was preparing in America,\r\nand would be shortly forwarded to England. To this novel application\r\nSir William Harcourt acceded, in courtesy to the applicant. The\r\npromised affidavits arrived, and were considered by the Home Secretary\r\nas insufficient. Again a further application for delay was made, on\r\nthe promise of further evidence, and acceded to for the term of a\r\nfortnight, with clear notice to Lamson that if the promised affidavits\r\nwere not more satisfactory than the preceding ones, the sentence\r\nwould be carried out. Such they proved in the opinion of Sir William\r\nHarcourt, and Lamson was at length executed on the 28th of April.\r\n\r\nThe proffered evidence not only covered the whole of Lamson’s life from\r\nthe days of his medical pupilage at Paris till his trial, but sought\r\nto establish “a marked hereditary tendency to insanity,” from the fact\r\nthat his grandmother had been in the New York Bloomingdale Asylum from\r\nthe age of seventy-six till her death four years after, and had been\r\npreviously suffering from “senile dementia,” the apparent cause of\r\nwhich was entered in the Hospital Register as “predisposing;”—that\r\nher brother, a sea captain, at the age of eighty, was in the same\r\nasylum, having been suffering for two years from “dementia,” also\r\nentered as “predisposing;” and that her daughter, a Mrs. McGregor, at\r\nthe age of thirty-one, was a patient until her death about three years\r\nafter—her mania “puerperal,” and also entered as “predisposing.”[215]\r\nNo evidence, however, was offered of the mental condition of any less\r\nremote ancestors.\r\n\r\nAs a _Medical Student_ in Paris in 1869-70, Lamson is described as\r\nsuffering from cerebral anæmia with a tendency to melancholia, given\r\nto imaginary complaints about the surgical theatre, apt to take\r\noffence, with a passion for chemical experiments of a morbid character,\r\ngenerally genial in manner, and taciturn of speech. When employed in\r\nthe American Ambulance during the siege of Paris in 1870-71, “his\r\nbehaviour was so wild, erratic, and bad, that his associate aids were\r\nnot prepared to say whether it was that of an idiot or the result\r\nof special wickedness—his mind so disordered that he could not be\r\nentrusted to administer medicines, as to the effects of which he seemed\r\nto be utterly destitute of judgment and common sense—just as likely to\r\ngive a large and dangerous dose as a smaller and safe one, no matter\r\nhow particularly instructed, and seemed to be utterly reckless of\r\nresults.”[216]\r\n\r\nFrom this date to the year 1877, no evidence was offered of his conduct\r\nor state of mind. In that year he acted as a surgeon for the Red Cross\r\nSociety at Bucharest, in the Servian War. Whilst there “he exhibited a\r\nmania for the administration of aconitia in almost every case, using\r\nit in season and out of season, and in such quantities as to alarm the\r\nmedical staff and render his recall to England necessary. Here, too, he\r\nappears to have commenced on himself the extravagant use of hypodermic\r\ninjections of morphia, to which he subsequently became so notoriously\r\naddicted, on the plea that he was in constant pain and misery,” and to\r\nhave been constantly under the influence of some anæsthetic. He was\r\nalso habitually incoherent and inconsistent in his way of talking,\r\nboasting of adventures in the American Civil War, when he could have\r\nbeen only twelve years of age. His father, who was with him, seemed to\r\nkeep a constant watch over his son, and frequently expressed his wish\r\nthat some other surgeon should be associated with him.[217]\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Lamson purchased a medical practice at Bournemouth, and during\r\nthe two years that he remained there, according to the testimony of\r\nfriends and servants, behaved in a most erratic and strange manner.\r\nWhilst there his habit of injecting morphia under his skin increased\r\nin a most extraordinary degree, one witness saying that “he was hardly\r\never in his company for more than an hour that he did not use the\r\nhypodermic syringe.” When visiting patients he seemed not to know\r\nwhy he had come, or what he ought to do, behaving so strangely that\r\nhis services were eventually dispensed with. His habit of telling\r\nextravagant stories grew rapidly upon him. His eyes had a fitful and\r\nnervous look as if afraid of phantoms. He seemed to be perpetually\r\ntrying to look sane, and the witness (Warren, an artist) who spoke\r\nto these symptoms said “he had frequently seen him walking along\r\nquickly, his head hanging down, when he would stop suddenly, turn\r\nback, and branch off in some other direction, crossing backwards and\r\nforwards over the road without rhyme or reason.” Mr. Radcliffe Hall, of\r\nWelbeck-street, to whom Lamson had made in writing a perfectly baseless\r\nstatement about Mrs. Hall’s antecedents, and afterwards could remember\r\nnothing about it, had seen him inject morphia twenty times a day.\r\nHis servants thought him mad, and humoured him accordingly, and the\r\npatients who attended at the dispensary which with another medical man\r\nhe managed, with only one or two exceptions, refused to be attended by\r\nhim.[218]\r\n\r\nFrom April to May, 1881, Lamson was staying at Rouse’s Point, New York,\r\nwith the Rev. Irving McElroy, the rector of Christ Church, during which\r\nperiod his habit of injecting morphia was continued, and, according\r\nto the testimony of the rector and his wife, Dr. Winston, the Medical\r\nDirector of the New York Mutual Life Assurance Company, Dr. Murray,\r\nPhysician of Rouse’s Point, Dr. Hall, and others who knew him, it was\r\nseriously affecting his brain. On one occasion he was found in the\r\npublic street with no coat on, and his left arm bared. He had a syringe\r\nin one hand, and with the thumb of the other was pressing down the\r\nplace where the injection had been made.[219] At his friend’s house\r\nhe passed the greater part of the day on the lounge, either dozing or\r\nattempting to read. He was then using a mixture apparently of morphia\r\nand atropine, but told them he preferred aconitine, but could not\r\nprocure it in that section of the county. To one of the witnesses he\r\nadmitted that his whole existence depended on the constant use of\r\nmorphia. The marks of these repeated injections were detected by Dr.\r\nWilliamson of Edinburgh whom Lamson consulted in New York in October,\r\n1881, who marked the serious change that had taken place in his\r\nhealth, and urged his discontinuance of this baneful practice. Dr. Hall\r\nconsidered Lamson “not a perfectly sane man,” Dr. Winston considered\r\nthat he “had become a helpless victim of the habit (of injecting\r\nmorphia) which had seriously impaired his mental powers and destroyed\r\nhis moral responsibility,” and in Dr. Murray’s opinion “he was utterly\r\nirresponsible for his acts.” It is admitted, however, that at intervals\r\nhis conversation was perfectly clear and lucid, and to none of the\r\nmedical men appears to have been put the legal test question, “did he\r\nknow the difference between right and wrong, at the time wherein he\r\ncommitted the crime?”[220]\r\n\r\nLastly, we are offered testimony as to the condition of Lamson’s\r\nmind for a few days immediately preceding the fatal occurrence, and\r\nthat of his father and wife as to his strange conduct for some time\r\nprevious. All, however, that this evidence amounts to is, that he was\r\nso strange and extravagant in his manner and conduct, that he was\r\nspoken of by friends and acquaintance as a lunatic, that “for a year\r\npast his wife’s fears and anxieties had been greatly and increasingly\r\naroused for the soundness of his mind—that his brain, predisposed to\r\nweakness, or constitutionally liable to disturbance, was unsettled\r\nby ill-health and trouble, and its disease aggravated by the use of\r\nmorphia.” His father spoke to the wild and fanciful delusions in which\r\nhis son indulged—the whole being myths, and believed “that for at\r\nleast eighteen months he had been in an unsound state of mind, steadily\r\nincreasing in its character and blinding him to the natural and\r\ninevitable effects of his acts; and that the balance of his mind had\r\nbeen quite destroyed.” His solicitor deposed that “he could obtain no\r\nassistance from him in the preparation of his defence—that he appeared\r\nto have no memory and to be incapable of appreciating the bearing of\r\nany of the facts of his case, or the gravity of his position; that he\r\nlaboured under extravagant hallucination, whilst his statements were\r\neither incoherent, inconsistent, or manifestly the creations of a\r\ndisordered brain.”\r\n\r\nThree medical men of experience speak to the effects almost certain\r\nto be produced by such an habitually excessive use of morphia or\r\nopium, as that of which Dr. Lamson was the victim. Dr. Coghill, of\r\nthe Ventnor Consumptive Hospital, and for eight years municipal\r\nmedical officer and consulting physician to a general hospital in\r\nChina, where he had unusual facilities for becoming familiar with\r\nthe effects of opium smoking and eating, has no hesitation in saying\r\nthat “anyone in the habit of using opium to such an extent would be\r\nincapable of self-control, and have his moral senses and powers of\r\njudgment deteriorated to a degree rendering him incapable of resisting\r\nmorbid influences.” Dr. H. H. Kane, of Fort Washington, New York,\r\nwho had written on the effects of “these drugs that enslave,” and on\r\nthe “Hypodermic Injection of Morphia,” and was then in charge of a\r\nhospital devoted to the treatment of opium smokers and eaters and the\r\nlike habits, admits that “as regards the question of insanity from the\r\nhabitual use of opium or its alkaloids, more especially morphia, but\r\nlittle definite is known. Insane Asylum reports,” he adds, “record\r\nevery year from six to eight cases of insanity attributed to the\r\nprolonged use of opiates; and physicians in general practice recognise\r\nit as a rare, though well-established, form of insanity. A person\r\nwith an hereditary tendency to insanity, or with a mind weakened from\r\nany combination of circumstances, or from bodily disease, using this\r\ndrug in large amount for a considerable time, could hardly escape some\r\nunsettling of his mental and moral powers. Actual mania, melancholia,\r\nand dementia are probably rare, but have undoubtedly occurred from\r\nthis cause. Of all the forms of the opium habit that by hypodermic\r\ninjection, as a rule, works the most harm in the shortest time.”\r\n\r\nDr. R. M. Miller, of Norwood, who saw Lamson professionally in\r\nJuly, 1881, when his friends were alarmed at his condition, is of\r\nopinion “that morphia and atropia, taken in such quantities, would\r\ngradually ruin the powers of the nervous system and also the powers of\r\nself-control.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the substance of the testimony of the cloud of witnesses\r\nproffered in support of the appeal for a scientific investigation\r\ninto the mental state of Lamson at the time when he committed the act\r\nfor which he was arraigned. To what does it amount? Even if it goes\r\nbeyond proof that he was occasionally nervous, disconnected in his\r\nideas, aimlessly untruthful, and with a hobby for the administration\r\nof aconitia as a panacea for all diseases, and a loss of vital nerve\r\nand energy, there is no evidence to suggest that these eccentricities\r\nwere dangerous or ever assumed the form of homicidal mania. “If,”\r\nsaid a contemporary writer, “Lamson could appreciate the pecuniary\r\nbenefit he would derive from Percy John’s death—and why else should\r\nhe have selected his victim?—he could realise the wickedness of\r\nhis act. A symptom of dangerous madness is that it acts without\r\napparent motive—the immediate circumstances of the murder pointed to\r\nthe exercise of a crafty deliberation, which, though not in itself\r\ninconsistent with homicidal mania, was not as aimless as homicidal\r\nmania.” Is it not a parallel case to that of Dove, a weak and erratic\r\nmind, in that case further weakened and unhinged by drink, in this case\r\nby the vicious use of morphia? Are not the words of Baron Bramwell\r\nin Dove’s case strictly applicable to this? “The rules of law,” said\r\nthat judge, “are that it must be clearly proved that, at the time of\r\ncommitting the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect\r\nof reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and\r\nquality of the act he was doing; and if he did know it, that he did not\r\nknow he was doing wrong.” Until the law is altered it is impossible\r\nto doubt that the Home Secretary was right, “that he could find in\r\nthe affidavits and statutory declarations no sufficient grounds for\r\nadvising an interference with the sentence of the law.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nACONITE: ACONITIA OR ACONITINE.\r\n\r\n Plants: Aconitum napellus—A. ferox. Alkaloids:\r\n Aconitia—Pseudaconitia—other bases—Decompositions—Proportions\r\n in the plants. Commercial aconitia—German aconitia—English\r\n aconitia. Separation—Tests, chemical and physiological.\r\n History—Preparations, official and non-official. Physiological\r\n effects—Causes of death—Post mortem appearances—Treatment and\r\n antidotes—Remarks—Phosphoric acid test—Case referred to by Dr.\r\n Stevenson.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE name aconite is applied to a great number of plants belonging\r\nto the natural order Ranunculaceæ. Two species only need be noticed\r\nhere, _Aconitum napellus_ and _A. ferox_. The former is the well-known\r\n“monkshood,” “wolfsbane,” or “blue rocket,” a very beautiful but\r\nexceedingly poisonous plant, commonly cultivated in English gardens.\r\nThis very variable and widely diffused species is found in the\r\nmountainous districts of the temperate regions of the northern\r\nhemisphere: it occurs in the Alps up to an altitude of more than 6,000\r\nfeet, in the Pyrenees, and in the mountain ranges of Germany and\r\nAustria. It is also met with in Sweden, Denmark, Siberia, and in the\r\nmountainous districts on the Pacific coast of North America.\r\n\r\n_Aconitum ferox_, Nepaul aconite —“Bikh”), is a native of the\r\nsubalpine Himalayas, occurring, together with A. napellus and several\r\nother poisonous species, at an elevation of 10,000 to 14,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe most recent researches of Dr. C. R. Alder Wright and others have\r\nshown that Aconitum napellus chiefly owes its poisonous properties to\r\nthe base _aconitia_, or _aconitine_ (also called _aconitina_), C_{33}\r\nH_{43} NO_{12}, a highly active crystallizable alkaloid furnishing\r\nreadily crystallizable salts. This base constitutes about one-half of\r\nthe total quantity of alkaloids present in the root, and is considered\r\nto be in combination with _aconitic acid_, H_{3} C_{6} H_{3} O_{6}.\r\nThere is also present, but in much smaller quantity (about 10 per\r\ncent. of the total bases present—Wright), another physiologically\r\nactive crystallizable alkaloid, _pseudaconitia_, C_{36} H_{49} NO_{12},\r\nsimilar in many respects to aconitia (especially in its effects\r\nupon the animal system), but not so readily yielding crystallizable\r\nsalts. The roots of A. napellus contain, in addition to aconitia and\r\npseudaconitia, a considerable quantity of a third base, comparatively\r\ninert, apparently amorphous, yielding non-crystallizable salts, and\r\ncontaining a higher percentage of carbon than either aconitia or\r\npseudaconitia.\r\n\r\nAconitum ferox contains as its active principle _pseudaconitia_, or\r\n_nepaline_, associated with a comparatively small quantity of aconitia:\r\nthere is present in addition a non-crystallizable alkaloid containing\r\nmore carbon than either of the other bases, but apparently not\r\nidentical with the analogous body from A. napellus.\r\n\r\nThe plants have been stated to contain, besides the bases already\r\nnamed, various other alkaloids, such as “napel-line,” “acolyctine,”\r\n“lycoctonine,” &c., but there is no doubt that these substances are\r\nmerely products of the decomposition of aconitia and pseudaconitia,\r\nformed during the process of extraction. Aconitia and pseudaconitia\r\nare very easily decomposed; thus, when heated with water in a sealed\r\ntube, the former is converted into benzoic acid and a fresh alkaloid,\r\n_aconine_, C_{26} H_{39} NO_{11}, the reaction being represented by the\r\nfollowing equation:—\r\n\r\n  C_{33} H_{43} NO_{12}+H_{2}O=C_{7} H_{6} O_{2}+C_{26} H_{39} NO_{11}.\r\n  Aconitia.              Water.     Benzoic acid.          Aconine.\r\n\r\nPseudaconitia, so treated, yields dimethyl-protocatechuic (or\r\n“veratric”) acid and a new base, _pseudaconine_, C_{27} H_{41} NO_{9},\r\nthe equation being:—\r\n\r\n  C_{36} H_{49} NO_{12}+H_{2} O=C_{9} H_{10}O_{4} + C_{27}H_{41} NO_{9}.\r\n  Pseudaconitia.        Water.  Dimethyl-protocatechuic    Pseudaconine.\r\n                                         acid.\r\n\r\nAconine is doubtless identical with Hübschmann’s “napel-line,”\r\ndiscovered by him in commercial aconitia, and afterwards proved to\r\nbe the same as the “acolyctine” which he had previously obtained.\r\nPseudaconine is apparently the base “lycoctonine” of the same chemist.\r\n\r\nCommercial aconitia is a mixture of aconitia and pseudaconitia with\r\nvariable quantities of their decomposition-products, aconine and\r\npseudaconine, and of the amorphous unnamed alkaloids above referred\r\nto (Wright and others; Year-Book of Pharmacy, 1877, _et seq._).\r\nIn commercial aconitia prepared from Aconitum napellus (_German\r\naconitia_), _aconitia_ predominates: _English aconitia_ is chiefly if\r\nnot entirely prepared from A. ferox, and in it _pseudaconitia_ is the\r\nprevailing active base.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the plants (A. napellus and A. ferox) are poisonous,\r\nthe active principles being contained in the seeds, roots, leaves\r\nand flowering tops. The roots are chiefly used for the extraction of\r\nthe alkaloids, of which the proportions yielded are very variable\r\nand depend on the time when the roots are collected. An ounce of the\r\nfresh root of A. napellus contains, according to Woodman and Tidy,\r\nfrom ¼ to ¾ of a grain of aconitia, while a pound of the dried root\r\nfurnishes from 12 to 36 grains, or 0·1 to 0·2 per cent. “The average\r\nproduce of the root, _collected after flowering_ and fresh, is 8·58\r\ngrains of aconitia in the pound; of the same dried, 35·72 grains. But\r\nif collected before flowering, the yield is only 3·5 grains per pound\r\nin the fresh, and 12·13 in the dried root (Herapath). These results are\r\nthe average of several experiments.... The root of A. ferox contains\r\nabout three times as much alkaloid as that of the English plant”\r\n(Royle’s Mat. Med.). According to Wright and Rennie (Year-Book of\r\nPharm., 1880, 458), the percentage of total bases yielded by the root\r\nof A. napellus, calculated on the dry substance, amounted to ·07 per\r\ncent., equivalent to about ·05 per cent, of total alkaloids in the dry\r\nherb. Two-fifths of the total alkaloid consisted of pure crystallized\r\naconitia.\r\n\r\nCommercial aconitia or aconitine is generally met with as a white\r\namorphous powder, but is occasionally crystalline. It dissolves in\r\n150 parts of cold and 50 parts of hot water, and is also soluble in\r\nalcohol, benzole, and chloroform: it is inodorous, possesses an acrid\r\ntaste (W. and T., For. Med., p. 392), and is strongly alkaline to\r\ntest-paper. It generally fuses below 100° C. (60° C., W. and T.), and\r\ngives an amorphous sublimate above 150° C. (_pure_ aconitia fuses\r\nat 183°-184° C.: _pure_ pseudaconitia melts at 104°-105° C.): when\r\nstrongly heated with free access of air, it burns with a yellow, smoky\r\nflame, leaving no residue. Crystallized samples of commercial aconitia\r\nare the purest. Amorphous aconitia, and particularly that prepared in\r\nGermany, is very impure, being admixed with considerable quantities\r\nof comparatively inert bases. The use of such a preparation should be\r\navoided, as being liable to give rise to a false idea as to the proper\r\ndose of the pure alkaloid (Royle’s Mat. Med., 1876, p. 773). Morson’s\r\n“English aconitine” (_pseudaconitia_) is much more powerful than the\r\nFrench and German products, which are mostly prepared from A. napellus,\r\nand consist mainly of aconitia.[221]\r\n\r\nAconitia and pseudaconitia differ from one another in their\r\nmolecular weights and melting-points; they also furnish different\r\ndecomposition-products: aconitia readily furnishes well-crystallized\r\nsalts, while the salts of pseudaconitia are usually obtained amorphous;\r\nand finally, crystallized aconitia is anhydrous, while pseudaconitia\r\ncrystallizes with one atom of water.\r\n\r\nThe two bases are similar as regards their physiological action\r\n(pseudaconitia is perhaps somewhat more powerfully active than\r\naconitia), and general behaviour with reagents.\r\n\r\nThe characters and physiological action of commercial aconitia\r\n_vary greatly_, as might be expected from the ununiformity of its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION AND TESTS.\r\n\r\nFor the extraction and separation of aconitia from anima matters, the\r\nmodification of Stas’s general method, described on page 5 (Chap. I.),\r\nmay be employed. The alkaloids of aconite being, as has been already\r\nshown, very liable to decomposition, great care must be taken, during\r\nthe extraction with alcohol and subsequent evaporation of the extracts,\r\nthat the temperature does not rise above 50° C.: the use of mineral\r\nacids should also be avoided.\r\n\r\n_Tests._—1. The residue of aconitia or pseudaconitia, obtained on\r\nspontaneous evaporation of the anhydrous chloroform solution, will\r\ngenerally be found to be more or less crystalline, when examined under\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\n2. The Taste Test.—A minute portion of the residue, either alone or\r\ndissolved in a small quantity of water acidulated with acetic acid,\r\nshould be rubbed with the finger on the lips and gums, or cautiously\r\napplied to the tip of the tongue. If aconitia or pseudaconitia be\r\npresent, a peculiar tingling and numbness will be quickly experienced\r\nin and around the parts to which the alkaloidal extract has been\r\napplied: salivation, with a desire to expectorate, and a sense of\r\nswelling at the back of the throat, are also frequently noticed. The\r\neffects, or some of them, usually last from three to six hours, or even\r\nlonger. _This action is peculiar to aconite; the test, therefore, is of\r\nthe utmost value, and one which must never be omitted._\r\n\r\n3. The Physiological Test.—Inject a small quantity of the alkaloidal\r\nextract, dissolved in a little water acidulated with acetic acid,\r\ninto the back of a mouse or other small animal. In the event of\r\naconitia being present, characteristic symptoms of aconite poisoning\r\nare manifested in a few minutes, and the death of the animal rapidly\r\nensues. Among the chief symptoms observed by Dr. Fleming, in some\r\nexperiments upon animals, made in 1844, were “weakness of the limbs,\r\nstaggering, a gradually increasing paralysis of the voluntary\r\nmuscles, loss or diminution of sight, slowness of pulse, difficulty of\r\nbreathing, occasional convulsive movements, in two cases opisthotonos,\r\ncontracted pupils, but often dilating two or three minutes before\r\ndeath, and death by asphyxia.” (Woodman and Tidy’s For. Med., p. 394).\r\nThis test is also a very important one.\r\n\r\n4. Chemical Tests.—Solutions of salts of aconitia and pseudaconitia\r\nare precipitated by most of the general reagents for alkaloids, such\r\nas Mayer’s reagent, tannic acid, potassium tri-iodide, phosphomolybdic\r\nacid, &c. Platinic chloride, picric or carbazotic acid, and auric\r\nchloride, however, do _not_ give precipitates, except in _concentrated_\r\nsolutions. Among the special tests for aconitia and pseudaconitia\r\nwhich have been described, the following may be mentioned. (A)\r\nWith _sulphuric acid_, no change takes place in the cold, but on\r\nwarming, a pale yellow, deepening into brown, and finally changing\r\ninto violet-red, is observed. This reaction varies very greatly with\r\ndifferent samples of aconitia, and little or no reliance can be placed\r\nupon it as a toxicological test. (B) With _sulphuric acid_ and a drop\r\nof _saturated solution of sugar_, a fine rose-red colour, passing into\r\ndingy brown, has been obtained. Experience, however, has not shown\r\nthis test to be of any especial value. (C) If cautiously heated for\r\nten or fifteen minutes on the water-bath with a few drops of _syrupy\r\nphosphoric acid_, aconitia is said to yield a violet or blue colour.\r\nThis reaction is uncertain and therefore useless: it may be obtained\r\nwith impure samples, while pure aconitia and pseudaconitia fail to give\r\nit. Mr. T. B. Groves (Year-Book of Pharmacy, 1873) says:—“The colour\r\nreactions of these alkaloids may be dismissed in a word. There are\r\n‘none.’ As for the phosphoric acid reaction producing a blue colour,\r\nI have never succeeded in obtaining it. It is probably due to some\r\naccidental impurity, and I believe Dr. Flückiger has arrived at the\r\nsame conclusion.”\r\n\r\nHence, as there are no reliable, characteristic, and distinctive\r\nchemical tests for aconitia, its presence or absence must be judged\r\nchiefly from the results of the tests of taste and physiological\r\naction on small animals. _A substance, previously proved to be an\r\nalkaloid by its yielding precipitates with most of the general reagents\r\nfor alkaloids, and which, when applied to the tongue and injected under\r\nthe skin of a small animal, produces the effects already described, is\r\nabsolutely certain to be aconitia._\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY, PREPARATIONS, AND DOSES.\r\n\r\n_History._—The _Ἀκόνιτον_ of the Greeks and Aconitum of the Romans\r\nare believed to refer to the genus Aconitum, if not actually to\r\nA. napellus. The ancients were well acquainted with the poisonous\r\nproperties of aconite, which has been widely used as an arrow-poison.\r\nIt was employed by the ancient Chinese, and is still in requisition\r\namong the less civilised hill tribes of India.[222] Something similar\r\nwas in use among the aborigines of ancient Gaul. In a Welsh MS. of\r\nthe 13th century, aconite was pointed out as one of the plants which\r\nevery physician was to grow. The root and the herb are met with in the\r\nGerman pharmaceutical tariff of the 17th century. Störck, of Vienna,\r\nintroduced aconite into regular practice about the year 1762 (Flückiger\r\nand Hanbury; “Pharmacographia,” 1879).\r\n\r\n_Preparations and Medicinal Doses,_—Aconite leaves (Aconiti Folia) and\r\nroot (Aconiti Radix) are officinal in the British Pharmacopœia, and the\r\nplants from which they are obtained (A. napellus) are cultivated in\r\nBritain (Squire’s Companion to the B. P., 1868). The chief preparations\r\nare as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. _Aconitia_, B. P.—Aconitine. Not for internal use, according to the\r\nPharmacopœia. It is, however, occasionally prescribed in very minute\r\ndoses (1/400 to 1/50 of a grain by the mouth: not more than 1/200 of a\r\ngrain, subcutaneously injected; Royle’s Materia Medica). Dr. J. Harley\r\nhas given 1/200 of a grain, once a day, in fevers.\r\n\r\n2. _Unguentum Aconitiæ_, _B. P._—Ointment of aconitia. Prepared with\r\nlard. Strength, 8 grains of aconitia to the ounce (= 1·66 per cent.).\r\nFor external application in painful nervous affections, neuralgia, &c.\r\n\r\n3. _Linimentum Aconiti_, _B. P._—Useful for external application in\r\nneuralgia or lumbago. May contain about 2 per cent. of aconitia (Blyth).\r\n\r\n4. _Extractum Aconiti_, _B. P._—Prepared from the leaves and flowering\r\ntops. Dose, 1 to 2 grains.\r\n\r\n5. _Tinctura Aconiti_, _B. P._—Dose, 5 to 10 minims, twice or\r\nthrice a day (Squire); 5 to 15 minims, and only to be gradually if\r\nat all increased (Royle); never to exceed 5 minims (Farquharson’s\r\nTherapeutics).[223]\r\n\r\n6. _Fleming’s Tincture of Aconite_ is not officinal; it is nearly four\r\ntimes stronger than the B. P. tincture, and must on no account be given\r\nin the above doses (Royle).\r\n\r\n7. _Liston’s Strong Tincture._—Not officinal.\r\n\r\n8. _Aconiti Succus._—The expressed juice. Not officinal. Dose, 15 to\r\n20 minims (Squire’s Comp. to the B. P.).\r\n\r\n9. _Extractum Aconiti Rad._—Not officinal. Prepared with alcohol.\r\nDose, half a grain.\r\n\r\n_Fatal Dose of Aconitia._—Smallest: in one case 1/50 of a grain\r\nnearly proved fatal (Pereira). The tenth and even twentieth of a\r\ngrain are believed to have caused death (Headland; Herapath). The\r\naverage quantity for an adult is probably between 1/16 and 1/20 of a\r\ngrain. One drachm of the root, four grains of the alcoholic extract,\r\nand one drachm of the tincture have proved fatal.[224] Numerous\r\nwell-authenticated cases are on record of aconite root being scraped\r\nand eaten at table, in mistake for horseradish, with very serious and\r\neven fatal results.[225] (See Guy and Ferrier’s For. Med., p. 617.)\r\n\r\n_Fatal Period._—The shortest time in which death has been known to\r\noccur is 1¼ hour: the longest, 20 hours: average, less than 4 hours\r\n(Guy and Ferrier). A case is mentioned in Woodman and Tidy’s Forensic\r\nMedicine, however, in which death occurred in 20 _minutes_. “The\r\nsymptoms usually make their appearance in from a few minutes to one or\r\ntwo hours; whilst death usually takes place within three or four hours”\r\n(W. and T., p. 393).\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nAconite produces, locally applied, a tingling sensation, followed by\r\nnumbness, and the earliest symptom of poisoning by aconite, when any\r\none of its preparations has been taken by the mouth, is tingling,\r\nfollowed by numbness and anæsthesia of the lips and throat, afterwards\r\nbecoming general. Vomiting occurs frequently, but not universally:\r\npurging is not nearly so frequent (W. and T.). The intellectual\r\nfaculties are usually unaffected, but in some cases there is stupor.\r\nAconite paralyses both the reflex and motor activity of the spinal\r\ncord, hence there is an almost total loss of muscular power. The\r\nrespiratory centre is eventually paralysed, so that death may result\r\nfrom suffocation (Farquharson). The heart’s action becomes feeble and\r\nirregular; its rapidity is first diminished, then increased. The face\r\nis pale, and the body bathed in a clammy sweat: the pupils “are at\r\nfirst contracted, and afterwards dilated shortly before death.” The\r\nrespiration becomes slower, then irregular, and death generally results\r\nfrom its cessation (_asphyxia_).\r\n\r\nIn cases of poisoning by aconite, death may be caused by (1)\r\n_asphyxia_, (2) _shock_, or (3) _syncope_.\r\n\r\nThe following symptoms were noted in the case of a cat, to which\r\none-tenth of a grain of Morson’s English aconitia (= pseudaconitia,\r\nor nepaline) was administered:—stertorous and difficult breathing,\r\nstaggering motions, convulsions (always contracting, never stretching\r\nlike strychnia), vomiting, foaming at the mouth, moans and spasmodic\r\ncries, violent struggles for breath; the body fell over on one\r\nside, the limbs were stretched forward and worked spasmodically,\r\nbut never stiffened. Attacks intermittent, with peaceful intervals.\r\nInvoluntary defecation; retching (the stomach had already emptied\r\nitself), prolonged low moans, gasps for breath, abdominal rumblings,\r\ninsensibility for two hours with occasional twitching, moans and cries.\r\nEyes wide open, _pupils not contracted_. Finally, after 2½ hours, a few\r\nslight struggles, a convulsive gasp, and death. Stiffening very slow.\r\nTongue protruded beyond the teeth.\r\n\r\nTwelve hours after death, the rigidity was very strong. A post-mortem\r\nexamination was then made, with the following results. Pupils dilated.\r\nIntestines and other organs normal, not congested: lungs collapsed and\r\ncongested: heart very much venously congested. Blood not more fluid\r\nthan usual. Larynx filled with frothy mucus. Brain congested.\r\n\r\nOn analysis of the stomach and other organs an alkaloidal extract was\r\nobtained, which, when submitted to the taste test, produced all the\r\neffects characteristic of aconitia. It is worthy of remark that the\r\ncolour-tests completely failed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment and antidotes._—“Emetics, stimulants internal and external”\r\n(Squire’s Comp. B. P.). No chemical antidote is known: animal charcoal\r\nhas been recommended, but its efficacy is doubtful. A mustard emetic\r\nshould be applied, followed by the stomach-pump. “In the latter\r\nstages, depletion from a jugular vein to relieve the distension of the\r\nright heart, accompanied by the most persevering efforts to promote the\r\nexpansion of the chest.” Gentle magneto-electric currents down the back\r\nof the neck and around the margin of the ribs, to excite contractions\r\nof the diaphragm, accompanied by rhythmical abductions of the upper\r\nextremities, should be employed. If there is yet a capability of\r\nswallowing, brandy and ammonia should be given (Royle’s Mat. Med.).\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nPure aconitia is perhaps the most deadly poison with which we are\r\nat present acquainted, and all the preparations of aconite are\r\nexcessively poisonous. Unless employed with extreme caution they are\r\nvery dangerous, and should on no account be used, even for external\r\napplication, except with the advice of, or by a medical man.[226]\r\n\r\nThe urgent necessity for an alteration in the law at present relating\r\nto the sale of poisons, and for the introduction of a clause placing\r\nsome restrictions on the sale of patent medicines containing poisons,\r\nis strikingly shown by the fact that such preparations as “Neuraline”\r\nare now sold without any restriction whatever. Indeed, as the law at\r\npresent stands, the most virulent poisons, if contained in, or sold\r\nas patent medicines, can be obtained by any ordinary person with less\r\ndifficulty than the same poisons can be purchased, under their own\r\nproper names, by a medical man. Neuraline, a patent medicine containing\r\na preparation of aconite, was brought rather prominently forward,\r\nin 1872, in connection with the death of the Hon. G. C. Vernon, the\r\nquestion arising as to whether the too frequent use of neuraline by the\r\ndeceased, for pains in his head, had been the cause of death.[227]\r\n\r\nThe phosphoric acid test for aconitia, referred to by Mr. Montagu\r\nWilliams during the trial of Dr. Lamson, is described in Professor\r\nFlückiger’s work (“Pharmaceutische Chemie”; Berlin, 1879); but it is\r\nat the same time mentioned that crystallized aconitia gives only an\r\nextremely faint reaction, and crystallized nitrate of aconitia none at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt has been already pointed out (p. 573) that this test is one which\r\ncannot be relied on, and that the violet colour is believed to be due\r\nto impurities present rather than to aconitia itself.\r\n\r\nThe internal administration of aconitia in very small doses is\r\nrecommended, in cases of dysentery and typhoid fever, by a writer in\r\nthe _Journal of Medicine and Dosimetric Therapeutics, according to\r\nthe method of Dr. Ad. Burggraeve_, a publication edited by Dr. T. L.\r\nPhipson. Dr. Burggraeve’s method (or “dosimetry,” as it is called) is\r\nin several respects similar to homœopathy, and the journal in question\r\ncannot be regarded as a generally accepted authority.\r\n\r\nIn his speech for the defence, Mr. Montagu Williams referred to\r\nthe supposed existence of cadaveric alkaloids or ptomaines, and to\r\nthe absence of special chemical tests for aconitia. With reference\r\nto the ptomaines, see Chap. 1, p. 12. The objection, that there is\r\nno characteristic chemical test for aconitia, is to a great extent\r\ndeprived of its force when one remembers that aconitia can be proved to\r\nbe an alkaloid by its deportment with the general alkaloidal re-agents;\r\nthat the taste test alone will distinguish it from all other alkaloids;\r\nand that it exerts a powerful and distinctive action on small animals,\r\nand ultimately destroys them.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the remark of Lord Coleridge’s, quoted by\r\nMr. Montagu Williams, is nothing more than an expression of personal\r\nopinion, by an eminent _lawyer_ on a _purely scientific_ subject;\r\nvaluable, no doubt, but not necessarily infallible.\r\n\r\nThe statement of Messrs. Allen & Hanbury’s assistant, that aconitia is\r\nyellowish-white (p. 544), does not hold good of all samples: the colour\r\nof the alkaloids varies with their degree of purity, and pure aconitia\r\nis not less white than pure atropia.\r\n\r\nFull details of the case of poisoning by aconitia, referred to by Dr.\r\nStevenson (p. 534), are to be found in _Schmidt’s Jahrbücher der In-und\r\nAusländischen gesammten Medicin_, edited by Dr. Adolf Winter, vol. 189,\r\np. 122: the case was originally communicated by T. Haakma Tresling to\r\na Dutch journal (_Weekbl. van het Nederl. Tijdschr. voor Geneesk_, 16,\r\n1880). The following is a short account of this case.\r\n\r\nA patient, for whom medicine containing aconitia nitrate (to be taken\r\nin small and repeated doses) had been prescribed by a physician,\r\nDr. M., experienced soon after the first and second doses a burning\r\nsensation in the throat, followed by vomiting and, later on, by\r\ndifficulty of respiration: the skin was icy cold to the touch,\r\nalthough internally there was a sensation of burning throughout\r\nthe body. With the object of proving that these effects were not\r\nattributable to the medicine, Dr. M., at four p.m. on March 16th,\r\n1880, took a dose of the mixture, containing rather more than 1/16\r\ngrain of aconitia nitrate. The first symptoms of poisoning appeared\r\nin about an hour and a half; and, about four hours after he had\r\ntaken the poison, Dr. M. was found to be pallid, with a cold skin,\r\ncontracted pupils, small and irregular but not accelerated pulse,\r\nswollen tongue, headache, shivering fits, and a sensation of burning\r\nin the mouth: there was also pain extending from the throat to the\r\nlower part of the stomach. Suddenly the power of vision became extinct,\r\nsimultaneously with a great dilation of the pupils: sight shortly\r\nafterwards returned, the pupils at the same time again contracting.\r\nVomiting was induced by tickling the throat; the ejected matter was\r\nthick, red-coloured, and contained the remains of food previously\r\nconsumed: vomiting subsequently recurred spontaneously. The first\r\nconvulsions occurred eight hours and forty minutes after the dose had\r\nbeen taken; respiration became more difficult, and Dr. M. complained\r\nof humming in the ears, and deafness, first in one ear and then in\r\nthe other. Ether was now subcutaneously injected: dilation of pupils,\r\nwith loss of vision, again followed, being succeeded by vomiting, and\r\nviolent and long-continued convulsions. In eight hours and fifty-three\r\nminutes extraordinarily violent vomiting set in, and was followed by a\r\nsuccession of violent convulsions. Dr. M. could not again be restored\r\nto consciousness, the pupils were dilated and remained unaffected by\r\nthe light, and respiration was slow and laborious. Notwithstanding the\r\nemployment of electricity, breathing became slower, the beating of the\r\nheart ceased to be audible, and death occurred in nine hours from the\r\ntime at which the poison was taken.\r\n\r\nOn a _post-mortem_ examination being made, it was found that the\r\nsurface-tissues of the body were very pale and contained little\r\nblood, while the internal organs were much congested. The intestinal\r\ncongestion increased towards the stomach, and diminished towards the\r\nlarge intestine. The colon, rectum, and bladder were very pale and\r\nbloodless. The latter contained about 70 grammes (= 2¼ fl. oz.) of\r\nurine. The liver and spleen were enlarged, the kidneys small; all much\r\ncongested. Defecation had not taken place, though some urine had been\r\npassed. The lungs did not fill the cavity of the chest; they contained\r\nfresh infiltrations and some small cavities: adhesion, congestion, and,\r\nin the lower portions, numerous emphysematous patches. Much fat was\r\ndeposited on the right side of the heart, which contained thin blood.\r\nBrain congested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ACONITE,\r\n    varieties (napellus, ferox), 568\r\n    alkaloids, aconitine or aconitia, 569\r\n      pseudaconitia, 569\r\n      aconine and pseudaconine, 570\r\n    extraction and tests—\r\n        taste, 572\r\n        physiological, 572\r\n        chemical, 573\r\n    extraction and texts—\r\n        taste, 572\r\n        physiological, 572\r\n        chemical, 573\r\n    history and preparations, 574\r\n    doses, fatal, 575\r\n    fatal period, 576\r\n    cause of death, 577\r\n    post-mortem appearances, 577, 581\r\n    treatment and antidotes, 577\r\n    remarks.

The reagent is added till no further\r\n  precipitate is produced, which is known by filtering a small\r\n  portion at intervals and testing with the potassio-mercuric\r\n  iodide to see if finished. The strength of the solution must\r\n  be, as nearly as possible, 1 part of the alkaloid in 200, so\r\n  that an _approximate_ idea must first be obtained by weighing\r\n  or otherwise. As the quantity is in poison cases generally\r\n  too small to weigh, the approximate idea must be gathered by\r\n  comparing the intensity of the tests with those furnished by\r\n  known amounts of the alkaloid. Each cubic centimetre of Mayer’s\r\n  solution precipitates ·02 gramme of morphia, ·0268 of aconitia,\r\n  and ·0167 of strychnia. For further details see Blyth’s\r\n  Practical Chemistry, 1879, p. 289.\r\n\r\n  [5] Rennard (Chem. Centr. 1876, 456) asserts that acetic ether\r\n  is preferable to amylic alcohol, as the latter dissolves more\r\n  colouring matter.\r\n\r\n  [6] To recover the alkaloid, dissolve the precipitate in\r\n  sufficient sulphurous acid solution, and evaporate: the\r\n  sulphate is left (Wagner).\r\n\r\n  [7] If the picrate precipitate be dissolved in dilute potash,\r\n  and the solution shaken with ether-chloroform, the latter, on\r\n  evaporation, leaves the alkaloid again in a free state.\r\n\r\n  [8] At the inquest this witness said that she rinsed out one of\r\n  the glasses on the table to give the deceased the water.\r\n\r\n  [9] Evidence of Katherine White, barmaid; W. Marton, gardener;\r\n  J. Kendal, waiter at the Jerusalem Coffee-house; H. Crapp,\r\n  clerk G. W. Railway, Slough; G. Lewis, postboy at Salthill;\r\n  R. Roberts, innkeeper, Slough; C.

Holman, constable, of\r\n  Farnham-Royal.\r\n\r\n  [10] At the inquest, this witness, speaking of the results of\r\n  the chemical analysis, said:—“It may not have been prussic\r\n  acid, but in conjunction with some salt nearly allied to it. I\r\n  do not think it was administered by itself but in some liquid.\r\n  The salts of prussic acid have not the same pungent peculiar\r\n  odour as prussic acid itself. They would produce death, but he\r\n  could not say how quickly.” Mr. Norblad, on the same occasion,\r\n  suggested that one of the salts into the composition of which\r\n  prussic acid enters, might have been given; “that cyanide of\r\n  potassium, the salt to which he referred, would cause death\r\n  in from two seconds to a quarter of an hour, according to the\r\n  amount given.” At the time of the inquest it was not known\r\n  that the prisoner had bought of Thomas, Scheele’s solution of\r\n  prussic acid.

Platt, the clerk of\r\n  assize of the old Norfolk circuit, been able to correct the\r\n  cotemporary reports in the _Times_ and the _Bucks Herald_by the\r\n  original report of his experiments made by Mr. Cooper to the\r\n  prosecution. Mr. Cooper was unable to be at the inquest, and\r\n  the results of such of these experiments as Messrs. Champneys\r\n  and Norblad had witnessed were then alone given in evidence,\r\n  excluding those where the odour of prussic acid was smelt by\r\n  Mr. Cooper and his sons, and where the quantity in the portion\r\n  of the contents of the stomach submitted to analysation was\r\n  determined.\r\n\r\n  [14] See the table of Mr. Stewart’s experiments on bitter and\r\n  sweet apples, and other fruits, p. 59.\r\n\r\n  [15] The reporter is wrong here; see cross-examination of Mr.\r\n  Champneys, p. 24, in which he says that neither Mr. Norblad nor\r\n  Mr. Pickering smelt the odour on the first opening of the body.\r\n\r\n  [16] Sweet almonds would not affect the production of prussic\r\n  acid from the apple-pips, except as tending to produce emulsine.\r\n\r\n  [17] See note at p. 38 as to Pickering’s evidence on this point.\r\n\r\n  [18] See p. 58.\r\n\r\n  [19] Judge Therry’s Reminiscences of 30 Years’ Residence in N.\r\n  S.

I have altered the conclusion\r\n  of the Judge’s remarks from information supplied to me by a\r\n  relative well acquainted with Sydney in those days.\r\n\r\n  [20] Animal matter contains the elements carbon, hydrogen,\r\n  nitrogen, and oxygen: the carbon and nitrogen unite with the\r\n  alkaline metal to form a cyanide, or a ferrocyanide if iron\r\n  also be present.\r\n\r\n  [21] Case of Sir T. Boughton, 1781.\r\n\r\n  [22] The potash and ferrous salt form potassium sulphate and\r\n  ferrous hydroxide, the latter combines with cyanogen and more\r\n  potash to form potassium ferro-cyanide, the ferric chloride\r\n  with the potash produces ferric hydroxide and potassium\r\n  chloride; when the hydrochloric acid is added, it dissolves up\r\n  the excess of ferrous and ferric hydroxides, forming ferrous\r\n  and ferric chlorides, and the ferric chloride unites with the\r\n  potassium ferrocyanide to form ferric ferrocyanide or Prussian\r\n  blue.\r\n\r\n  [23] Professor Carey Lea (American Journal of Science, 3,\r\n  ix., 121) prefers to mix a weak solution of ammonio-ferrous\r\n  sulphate with a little ammonio-ferric citrate, to acidify with\r\n  hydrochloric acid, then to place two or three drops of this\r\n  on a white plate, and to add a few drops of the suspected\r\n  solution. A blue cloudiness indicates HCN. This method, he\r\n  says, is capable of detecting 1/5000 of a grain of HCN. But I\r\n  do not think it more delicate than the old method if properly\r\n  performed, and it does not so easily admit of comparative\r\n  experiment as to quantity.\r\n\r\n  [24] Professor Toynbee met his death by incautious use in this\r\n  way.\r\n\r\n  [25] Death from suffocation.\r\n\r\n  [26] 19 Vict. c. 16.\r\n\r\n  [27] The authorities for the following report are (1) Report of\r\n  Trial of William Palmer.

I have also availed myself of Mr. Justice\r\n  Stephens’ summary of the trial and his comments on the\r\n  evidence, in the appendix to the third volume of his History of\r\n  the Criminal Law of England.\r\n\r\n  [28] “From his childhood upward,” says his brother, “no man was\r\n  gentler of heart—his charity was inexhaustible; his kindliness\r\n  to all who were in distress well known. To him the wanderer\r\n  resorted in his afflictions; by him the poor and houseless\r\n  were fed and comforted. I write in the face of the public,\r\n  with my character as a gentleman and a clergyman at stake, and\r\n  I avow only facts that cannot be denied. His liberality was a\r\n  proverb; his frank sincerity, his courage, his faithful loyalty\r\n  to his friends, his temperance, his performance of the duties\r\n  of religion, his social relations in the character of father,\r\n  husband, and son, won for him the love and confidence of all\r\n  who approached him; and though it is true that in one fatal\r\n  instance he violated the laws of his country, and subjected\r\n  himself to a severe penalty for an infringement of its\r\n  commercial code, yet, this excepted, his was in all respects\r\n  the very opposite of that cool, calculating, cowardly, crafty\r\n  temper, which is essential to the poisoner, and we know cannot\r\n  co-exist with those qualities which my brother possessed from\r\n  his earliest years down even to the day when your lordship sent\r\n  him to his death.” Letter to Lord Campbell, pp. 4, 5.\r\n\r\n  [29] The excuse put forward for this was his wish to raise\r\n  money for Bate. The prisoner’s brother complains, in his letter\r\n  to Lord Campbell, pp. 29, 30, and with justice, that though the\r\n  evidence of the negotiation for this insurance was afterwards\r\n  excluded as irrelevant, the statement was allowed to be made\r\n  by the Attorney-General without a comment, which Lord Campbell\r\n  must have known would prejudice the case against the prisoner.\r\n  This exclusion of the evidence of a statement which has been\r\n  allowed to pass unchallenged is nearly as useless as the formal\r\n  warning not to pay any attention to some evidence that has\r\n  been wrongly admitted—the prejudice has been raised, and the\r\n  mischief already done. But for the result of this trial, he\r\n  would have been tried for the murder of his wife, whose body\r\n  had been exhumed and analysed.\r\n\r\n  [30] As the probability of Cook’s state of health predisposing\r\n  him to epileptic attacks was made part of the prisoner’s case,\r\n  the evidence of his regular medical attendant is subjoined:—\r\n\r\n  _Dr. Henry Savage_, physician, of 7, Gloucester-place,\r\n  _examined by the Attorney-General_.—I knew John Parsons Cook.\r\n  He had been in the habit of consulting me professionally during\r\n  the last four years. He was a man not of robust constitution;\r\n  but his general health was good. He came to me in May,\r\n  1855, but I saw him about November of the year before, and\r\n  early in the spring of 1855. In the spring of 1855 the old\r\n  affair—indigestion—was one cause of his visiting me, and he had\r\n  some spots upon his body, about which he was uneasy. He had\r\n  also two shallow ulcers on his tongue, which corresponded with\r\n  two bad teeth. He said that he had been under a mild mercurial\r\n  course, and he imagined that those spots were very syphilitic.\r\n  I thought they were not, and I recommended the discontinuance\r\n  of mercury. I gave him quinine as a tonic, and an aperient\r\n  composed of cream of tartar, magnesia, and sulphur. I never\r\n  at any time gave him antimony. Under the treatment which I\r\n  prescribed the sores gradually disappeared, and they were quite\r\n  well by the end of May. I saw him, however, frequently in June,\r\n  as he still felt some little anxiety about the accuracy of my\r\n  opinion. If any little spot made its appearance he came to me,\r\n  and I also was anxious on the subject, as my opinion differed\r\n  from that of another medical man in London. Every time he came\r\n  to me I examined him carefully. There were no indications\r\n  of a syphilitic character about the sores, and there was no\r\n  ulceration of the throat, but one of the tonsils was slightly\r\n  enlarged and tender. I saw him last alive, and carefully\r\n  examined him, either on the 3rd or 5th of November. There was\r\n  in my judgment no venereal taint about him at the time.\r\n\r\n  _Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shee._—I do not think that\r\n  the deceased was fond of taking mercury before I advised him\r\n  against it; but he was timid on the subject of his throat, and\r\n  was apt to take the advice of anyone. No; I don’t think that he\r\n  would take quack medicines. I don’t think he was so foolish as\r\n  that.\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Stevens_, his stepfather, who saw him at the Euston\r\n  Station on the 5th of November, when starting for Rugeley,\r\n  said, “he looked better than he had seen him for a long time.\r\n  ‘You don’t look,’ he said to him, ‘like an invalid’; and Cook,\r\n  striking his chest, said he was quite well, and should be all\r\n  right if he was happy.” In point of appearance he was not a\r\n  robust man; his complexion was pale, and he had sore throat in\r\n  the previous winter for some months.\r\n\r\n  For the defence, _Foster_, a farmer, said he considered him of\r\n  a weak constitution, because he had bilious headaches, the last\r\n  a year and a half back, but admitted that he hunted three days\r\n  a week.\r\n\r\n  _John Sargeant_, a betting man, who met him at the races which\r\n  he attended, said:—I had an opportunity of seeing the state\r\n  of his throat before he died. I was with him at the Liverpool\r\n  meeting the week previous to the Shrewsbury races; we slept\r\n  in adjoining rooms. One morning he called me into his room\r\n  and drew my attention to his throat, which was much inflamed.\r\n  There were ulcers upon it, and the tongue was so swollen, that\r\n  I said I was surprised at the state of his mouth. He said he\r\n  had been in that state for weeks and months, “And now,” he\r\n  said, “I don’t take notice of it.” He had shown me his throat\r\n  before this at almost every meeting we attended. He took\r\n  some gingerbread and cayenne on the platform at Liverpool,\r\n  and told me afterwards it nearly killed him. (It came out\r\n  afterwards that the cayenne nut was a trick nut.) The witness\r\n  had also known Palmer supply Cook with blackwash before his\r\n  death. He had never seen Cook’s throat dressed by anybody, and\r\n  was surprised to see him eat and drink so well. He saw the\r\n  blackwash applied (externally) at the Warwick Spring Meeting in\r\n  1855. With reference to another point, this witness spoke to\r\n  Cook being unable to pay him more than £10 out of £25 at the\r\n  Liverpool meeting, and promising the balance at Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n  [31] On the part of the prisoner, a saddler at Rugeley, of\r\n  the name of _Myalt_, whom Fisher spoke of as being in the\r\n  room with Cook and Palmer, was called to give an entirely\r\n  different account of this suspicious incident. “I saw Cook,”\r\n  said this witness, “in Palmer’s company on Wednesday, about\r\n  twelve o’clock. I had not dined with Palmer, but at my house\r\n  at Rugeley, and got back to Shrewsbury between eight and nine,\r\n  and went to Palmer’s room to see if he was in. The first person\r\n  I saw was Cook at the room door, who said, ‘What brought you\r\n  here?’ I told him, ‘to see how they were getting on.’ Palmer,\r\n  I found, had gone out, and I went into the town, and was away\r\n  about an hour. “When I returned Palmer was not there, so I\r\n  waited in his room till he returned, about a couple of hours.\r\n  He came in with Cook, who was the worse for liquor—not very\r\n  drunk—rather. They asked me to take some brandy and water; it\r\n  was produced directly afterwards—the brandy in a decanter,\r\n  the water might be on the table. I did not leave the room at\r\n  all, from the time Cook and Palmer came in till they all went\r\n  to bed. I did not see anything put into the brandy and water;\r\n  nothing could be without my seeing it. Palmer and I left\r\n  together, and slept that night in the same room. Cook said\r\n  something about its being bad. He drank part of it off, and\r\n  then gave it to some one to taste. He proposed to have some\r\n  more, but Palmer said he would not unless Cook drank his out.\r\n  Nothing more happened that night. Next morning Palmer asked me\r\n  to call Cook. I went into his room, and he told me how ill he\r\n  had been in the night, and obliged to send for a doctor. He\r\n  asked me what had been put into the brandy and water, and I\r\n  told him I did not know of anything. He asked me to send for\r\n  the doctor—Palmer. I did so. The witness did not remember Mrs.\r\n  Brooks coming, or Palmer being called out of the room. He swore\r\n  that Cook did not say ‘it burns my throat.’ Did not remember\r\n  Fisher saying that it was no good his tasting it, as there\r\n  was nothing in the glass. He told Mr. Gardner and Mr. Stevens\r\n  before the inquest what he now said, but they had not subpœnaed\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  [32] “Lord Campbell did not even read this portion of the\r\n  witness’s evidence to the jury. Whatever its value might\r\n  be, and it had some in the prisoner’s favour, they were not\r\n  reminded of it, and can hardly be expected to have remembered\r\n  it after a twelve days’ trial.” Letter to Lord Campbell, p. 24.\r\n\r\n  [33] Some questions on this point were put to Mr. Gardner, the\r\n  solicitor for the prosecution, but were stopped as too general.\r\n\r\n  [34] Mills, in her cross-examination, said that Palmer “had on\r\n  a plaid dressing-gown, but could not say whether he had on a\r\n  cap or not.”\r\n\r\n  [35] Lord Campbell had omitted from his notes this\r\n  contradiction of the statement of Mills and others that\r\n  the body was arched, and when Mr. Serjeant Shee called his\r\n  attention to it, made no comment on it to the jury.—_Evidence\r\n  of Mary Keeling._\r\n\r\n  [36] But see the evidence of Mr. Partridge, Mr. Rogers, and\r\n  Mr. Pemberton as to the state of the exhumed corpse, and the\r\n  probable effect of the granules.—_Evidence of scientific\r\n  witnesses for the defence_, _post_, pp. 170-4.\r\n\r\n  [37] A _Mr. Devonshire_, a late assistant of Dr. Monckton’s,\r\n  who was present at the _post-mortem_, was also called to\r\n  confirm the previous witnesses. He also proved the extraction\r\n  of the liver, kidneys, spleen, and some blood, and their safe\r\n  delivery through a clerk (Boycott) to the attorneys at Rugeley\r\n  to Dr. Taylor for analysis.\r\n\r\n  [38] Mr. Curling agreed with Dr. Watson, _Principles and\r\n  Practice of Physic_, in the cases of “the sticking of a fish\r\n  bone in the fauces, the stroke of a whip-lash under the eye\r\n  leaving the skin unbroken, the cutting of a corn, the biting of\r\n  the finger by a sparrow, the blow of a stick on the neck, the\r\n  insertion of a seton, the extraction of a tooth, the injection\r\n  of a hydrocele, and the operation of cupping,” but not with\r\n  “the percussion of the air caused by a musket-shot.” He also\r\n  explained that the supposed case of tetanus produced at once\r\n  where a negro servant cut his thumb with a dish, rested on the\r\n  authority of an old cyclopædia, and that his judgment was more\r\n  mature and his experience greater than when, twenty-two years\r\n  of age, he wrote the treatise in which he had quoted this case.\r\n  (It was only in Rees’ Cyclopædia.)\r\n\r\n  [39] _Dr. Todd_, in reply to Lord Campbell, defined idiopathic\r\n  tetanus to be “that form of the disease which is produced\r\n  without any external wound, apparently from internal\r\n  causes—from a constitutional cause.”\r\n\r\n  [40] Evidence of _Dr. Robert Corbett_, physician, of Glasgow,\r\n  at the time medical clerk at the Glasgow Infirmary; _Dr.\r\n  Watson_, surgeon to the infirmary; _Dr. J. Patterson_, of the\r\n  infirmary laboratory; and _Mary Kelly_, patient.\r\n\r\n  [41] This is a test for brucia and not for strychnia.

Chemical\r\n  introduction, _ante_, p. 12, and Chapter V., p. 278.\r\n\r\n  [43] “Mr. Mayhew called on me with another gentleman with\r\n  an introduction from Professor Faraday. I received him as I\r\n  would Professor Faraday, and entered into conversation with\r\n  him about these cases. He represented, as I understood, that\r\n  he was connected with some insurance company, and wished for\r\n  information about a number of cases of poisoning that had\r\n  occurred during many years. After we had conversed about an\r\n  hour, he asked if there was any objection to the publication\r\n  of the details. Still believing him to be connected with an\r\n  insurance office, I replied that, so far as the correction of\r\n  error was concerned, I had no objection to anything appearing.\r\n  On that evening he went away without telling me he was\r\n  connected with the _Illustrated Times_, or any other paper. It\r\n  was not until Thursday that I knew that. It was the greatest\r\n  deception that ever was practised on a scientific man.”—_Dr.\r\n  Taylor’s evidence._ In his charge, Lord Campbell said, “I must\r\n  say I think it would have been better if Dr. Taylor, trusting\r\n  to the credit he had before acquired, had taken no notice of\r\n  what had been said; but it is for you to say, whether, he\r\n  having been misrepresented, and having written this letter to\r\n  the _Lancet_ to set himself right, materially detracted from\r\n  the credit which would otherwise be given to his evidence.” It\r\n  was these statements in the _Illustrated Times_, copied into\r\n  other papers, that led Dove to resort to strychnia to poison\r\n  his wife.—_See his case, post._\r\n\r\n  [44] On the value of experiments on animals, see Chemical\r\n  Introduction, _ante_, p. 6.\r\n\r\n  [45] “A mixture of sugar and bile, or a substance called\r\n  pyroxanthine—the product of a distillation of wood—will produce\r\n  the purple and red tint.”—_Taylor’s evidence._ But see Chapter\r\n  V.\r\n\r\n  [46] _Curarine._ See Chapter V.\r\n\r\n  [47] On this point see Chapter V.\r\n\r\n  [48] This suggestion of negligence on the part of the operator,\r\n  Mr. Devonshire, and the comments on it by the Attorney-General,\r\n  having subjected him to several attacks both in the Central\r\n  Criminal Court and in the _papers_, he gave the following\r\n  explanation in a letter to the _Morning News_, dated May 29:—\r\n\r\n  “It was agreed in consultation at Mr. Freer’s, at Rugeley,\r\n  that the stomach and intestines should be opened, and, with\r\n  their contents, enclosed in a jar. It was further agreed that\r\n  the spinal cord should not be opened if its upper portion and\r\n  the brain should prove to be in a healthy condition. At the\r\n  examination I was assisted by Mr. Newton, a young gentleman\r\n  who had, unfortunately, never witnessed a _post-mortem_. He\r\n  punctured the stomach, and about a teaspoonful of its contents\r\n  was lost. Afterwards, when Dr. Harland and I were examining\r\n  the lining membrane, Mr. Newton suddenly turned the stomach\r\n  inside out; an additional half teaspoonful was thus lost, the\r\n  remainder falling into the jar. This accounts for Dr. Taylor\r\n  finding the mucous membrane in contact with the intestines.\r\n  With the exception of this casual puncture I maintain the\r\n  _post-mortem_ was skilfully performed.”—_Letter to Lord\r\n  Campbell._ Appendix, p. xxiv.\r\n\r\n  [49] The extract from Orfila is: “In a dog who for four entire\r\n  months had taken no emetic, having taken three grammes in ten\r\n  days (that is, about forty-five grains), but had not taken any\r\n  for four months, the metal was found accumulated in the bones;\r\n  the liver also contained a great deal, and the other tissues\r\n  but little.”\r\n\r\n  [50] The letter referred mainly to the case of the prisoner’s\r\n  wife. Mr. Serjeant Shee wished only the concluding paragraph to\r\n  he read, but the Attorney-General insisted on the whole. It was\r\n  dated only Jan., published in the _Lancet_ of February 2, was\r\n  headed “_Audi alteram partem_,” and was as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “SIR,—I have great pleasure in replying to the inquiries\r\n  in your leading article of January 19. (1) I stated that I\r\n  had never known antimonial powder, when given in medicinal\r\n  doses (_i.e._, from five to eight grains a dose) to produce\r\n  vomiting or purging. I am aware that experience differs on\r\n  this point—that some have found the substance inert, and\r\n  others very active. From some recent experiments on antimonial\r\n  preparations, I think it not unlikely that the powder sometimes\r\n  contains arseniate of lime. Dr. Pereira mentions that in\r\n  the case of a dose of half a teaspoonful it on one occasion\r\n  produced violent vomiting, purging, and sweating; while in\r\n  still larger doses (120 grains to a dose), prescribed by Dr.\r\n  Elliotson, it occasioned in some instances only nausea. I\r\n  have never met with any case in which serious symptoms could\r\n  be referred to its operation; and in the case of Ann Palmer\r\n  (the wife) this medical preparation would not account for the\r\n  antimony found in her body. (2) My statement as to the cause\r\n  of death was that the deceased died from the effects of tartar\r\n  emetic, and from no other cause; that is the opinion which Dr.\r\n  Rees and myself formed from the result of our examination, and\r\n  from the description under which the deceased laboured during\r\n  the eight days before her death. It is an opinion now equally\r\n  shared by the two medical attendants of the deceased. We are\r\n  quite prepared to maintain this at the trial.” The letter then\r\n  went on to describe the state of Ann Palmer’s body, though not\r\n  exhumed until eighteen months after death, and contrasted it\r\n  with that of the brother, and concluded with the passage given\r\n  in the text. Its effect could not be but prejudicial to the\r\n  prisoner.\r\n\r\n  [51] In this case, stated by Dr. Christison, the patient had\r\n  been affected with some complaint for four weeks, and began to\r\n  take strychnia; in three hours there was stupor and loss of\r\n  speech, and at length violent tetanic convulsions, and death in\r\n  three hours and three-quarters.\r\n\r\n  [52] Probably a mistake of the reporter, as I cannot find any\r\n  clue to the meaning of this word.—C. G. S.\r\n\r\n  [53] An instance of the indestructibility of strychnia was\r\n  communicated by Mr. F. Crace Calvert, F.C.S., to the London\r\n  journals subsequently to the trial. In 1849 several hounds\r\n  of a pack in Cheshire were poisoned and one brought to his\r\n  laboratory, from which, by the usual process, strychnia\r\n  was obtained. “As the master of the hounds attached great\r\n  importance to the case, he requested me,” writes Mr. Calvert,\r\n  “to obtain a sufficient amount of poison from the stomachs of\r\n  some other of the dead dogs, that I might not only be convinced\r\n  of the presence of the poison, but might also bring some of\r\n  the extracted strychnia into court. To enable me to do so,\r\n  several dogs were disinterred and brought to my laboratory,\r\n  and the space of time from the date of death to that when I\r\n  submitted them to analysis was at least three weeks, and I\r\n  still perfectly succeeded in extracting strychnia from their\r\n  stomachs and exhibiting it in the state of crystallised\r\n  hydrochlorate.”—_Appendix to Letter to Lord Campbell_, p.\r\n  xxix. Another correspondent to the _Times_ called attention to\r\n  the practice in Mexico of killing a worn-out mule with _nux\r\n  vomica_, leaving its carcase to be eaten by the wolves, which\r\n  are thus killed, and that the Turkey buzzards who feed on the\r\n  dead wolves also die of the poison.—_Ib._ p. xxv.\r\n\r\n  [54] See Chapter V.\r\n\r\n  [55] An error. See Chapter V.\r\n\r\n  [56] The table of cases of poisoning by strychnia, with their\r\n  symptoms and results of the _post-mortem_, given by Mr. Woodman\r\n  and Dr. Tidy, shows that the state of the heart varies. In\r\n  six cases it was contracted and empty, in some others the\r\n  right side only was empty, and in one both sides were filled\r\n  with blood.—_Handy Book of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology._\r\n  London. 1877.\r\n\r\n  [57] In a letter to the _Times_ of June 4, Mr. Herapath says:\r\n  “I learnt on my return here (Bristol) that Mr. Yates had\r\n  visited Bristol with an anonymous letter in his hand (since\r\n  acknowledged to have been written by the magistrates’ clerk,\r\n  Keynsham), and questioned several gentlemen whom I am in the\r\n  habit of meeting, as to whether they heard me say ‘that I had\r\n  no doubt strychnia was in Cook’s body, but that Dr. Taylor\r\n  could not find it,’ and ‘that a word from me would hang the\r\n  man.’ They all said they had heard me speak of the case, but\r\n  not in such terms. The mayor said that ‘he could not say\r\n  the exact terms, but the impression on his mind was, that I\r\n  thought strychnia was there, but that Dr. Taylor could not find\r\n  it.’”—_Letter to Lord Campbell_, Appendix, p. xxxi.\r\n\r\n  [58] “The controversy,” as to the non-discovery of strychnia\r\n  by Dr. Taylor, says Mr. Justice Stephen, “was foreign to the\r\n  merits of the case, inasmuch as the evidence given for the\r\n  prisoner tended to prove, not that there was no strychnia in\r\n  Cook’s body, but that Dr. Taylor ought to have found it if it\r\n  was there. In other words it was relevant, not so much to the\r\n  guilt or innocence of the prisoner, as to whether Mr. Herapath\r\n  and Dr. Nunneley were better analytical chemists than Dr.\r\n  Taylor. The evidence could not be even considered relevant to\r\n  the shaking of Dr. Taylor’s credit, for no part of the case\r\n  rested on his evidence except the discovery of the antimony,\r\n  as to which he was corroborated by Mr. Brande, and not\r\n  contradicted by the prisoner’s witnesses.” (One does not see\r\n  how this could have been accomplished, as they were not present\r\n  at the analysis.) “His opinion as to the nature of Cook’s\r\n  symptoms was shared by many other medical witnesses of the\r\n  highest eminence, whose credit was altogether unimpeached. The\r\n  prisoner’s counsel was placed in a curious difficulty by this\r\n  state of the question. They had to attack, and did attack Dr.\r\n  Taylor’s credit vigorously, for the purpose of rebutting his\r\n  conclusion that Cook might have been poisoned by strychnia: yet\r\n  they had to maintain his credit as a skilful analyst. For if\r\n  they destroyed it, the fact that he did not discover strychnia\r\n  went for nothing. This dilemma was fatal. To admit his skill\r\n  was to admit their client’s guilt; to deny it, was to destroy\r\n  the value of nearly all their own evidence. The only possible\r\n  way was to admit his skill and deny his good faith; but this\r\n  too was useless for the reason just assigned.”—_History of\r\n  Criminal Law in England._ Vol. III., 418.\r\n\r\n  [59] Roberts, Theory and Practice of Medicine, 1877, Vol. II.,\r\n  23, gives the following symptoms of angina pectoris:—“Abrupt\r\n  suddenness—intense præcordial pain—oppression and constriction\r\n  of the chest—suffocation, no cyanosis—tenderness of chest\r\n  rare—face pale, sweat—expression of intense anxiety—pulse\r\n  mostly feeble, flickering occasionally—vomiting and eructation.\r\n  Conscious at first, but, if prolonged, may be syncope.\r\n  Spasmodic movements, and even general convulsions may be\r\n  observed. Usually several brief paroxysms with intermissions.\r\n  Tendency to rave under slight exciting causes.” Dr. Bristow,\r\n  Theory and Practice of Medicine, agrees with this, and adds,\r\n  “After death various lesions—most important _the calcification\r\n  of the coronary vessels_—fatty and other degenerations of\r\n  the muscular tissue of the heart. In other cases the heart\r\n  perfectly healthy.”\r\n\r\n  [60] In the _Appendix_, p. xxi., to the _letter to Lord\r\n  Campbell_, is a letter from a Mr. Lacy, a hatter of Nottingham,\r\n  dated June 2, to the _Morning News_, giving a very unfavourable\r\n  account of the earlier years of this witness. He appears to\r\n  have got out of the way after the trial, and to have evaded the\r\n  search made for him by the prisoner’s friends.\r\n\r\n  [61] In _cross-examination_, after admitting that he attested\r\n  the proposal to the _Prince of Wales_ office for £13,000 on\r\n  Walter Palmer’s life, and saying that he did not recollect\r\n  attesting another proposal on the same life to the _Universal_,\r\n  the proposal to that office was put into his hand, and he was\r\n  asked if the “Jeremiah Smith” attesting it was his signature.\r\n  “It is very like my signature,” he said, “but I have a doubt\r\n  of it.” (After a pause) “I believe it is not my handwriting; I\r\n  swear it is not. I think it a very good imitation. I did not\r\n  receive the document from Pratt; I might from W. Palmer. I\r\n  don’t recollect.” (After some hesitation) “No doubt he did give\r\n  it to me. I got it before it was signed.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“Do you now say it is not your signature?”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—“I do.” (He then admitted getting appointed agent to\r\n  the Midland County office in order to get a policy for £10,000\r\n  on Bate’s life.)\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“I will refresh your memory with regard to\r\n  these proposals. Look at that, and tell me whether it is your\r\n  handwriting?”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“Now, refreshing your memory with that\r\n  document, were you applied to in December, 1854, to attest a\r\n  proposal of Walter Palmer to the _Solicitors’ and General_\r\n  office for £13,000?”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—“That is my signature, certainly.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General_ repeats the question.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—“I don’t recollect.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“What, with your signature staring you in\r\n  the face?”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—“I might have been a witness to it. I am speaking\r\n  from memory.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“Have you any doubt, after looking at that\r\n  document?”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—“I have no doubt.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“At last we have got at it from you. Now\r\n  look to that document, and see if another month afterwards—in\r\n  January, 1855—you were asked to attest another proposal for\r\n  £13,000 to the _Prince of Wales_ office?”\r\n\r\n  _Witness_ (hesitating).—“That is my signature. (A pause.)\r\n  Perhaps if I saw the paper I could answer.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“There is the paper.”\r\n\r\n  _Witness_ (after a pause).—“I might have signed it in blank. I\r\n  have some doubt whether I did not sign some of these in blank.\r\n  The body of the papers is in the handwriting of William Palmer.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“Upon your oath, don’t you believe that\r\n  William Palmer applied to you to attest the proposal on his\r\n  brother’s life for £13,000?”\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—“He did apply to me.”\r\n\r\n  _Attorney-General._—“Was it not to attest the proposal for\r\n  £13,000 on his brother’s life?” _Witness._—“One of them was for\r\n  £13,000. I don’t think I was present when Walter Palmer signed\r\n  the assignment. I believe Jeremiah Smith’s (another witness of\r\n  that name) handwriting is very like mine.”\r\n\r\n  After much fencing with the question, the witness saying he\r\n  might or he might not have attested Walter Palmer’s signature\r\n  to a deed of assignment, the _Attorney-General_ put a cheque\r\n  for £5 into the witness’s hand, and asked him if it was William\r\n  Palmer’s signature to it.\r\n\r\n  _Answer._—“It is.”\r\n\r\n  _Question._—“Did you take that piece of paper to the bank and\r\n  get £5 for it, and that for attesting the signature of Walter\r\n  Palmer to the deed of assignment?”\r\n\r\n  _Answer._—“I may have got the £5 at the bank; but upon my\r\n  honour I do not know what for. (Laughter.) Cook, with reference\r\n  to the £200 bill, gave Palmer £10 for the accommodation, and he\r\n  took the money to Shrewsbury races. I cannot say who saw me on\r\n  the Monday night when I went up to Cook’s room at the ‘Talbot\r\n  Arms.’ I did not notice. I believe that either the chambermaid,\r\n  the waitress, or the cook saw me go into the hotel. I don’t\r\n  know who drove the fly to Stafford.”\r\n\r\n  This witness was also severely cross-examined as to his\r\n  relations with Mrs. Palmer, replying with the same caution as\r\n  to their impropriety, and could not get further than “that\r\n  there ought not to be any truth” in the imputation.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Justice Stephen, who was present at the trial, gives the\r\n  following graphic sketch of the demeanour of this witness:—“No\r\n  abbreviation can give the effect of this cross-examination. The\r\n  witness’s efforts to gain time, and his distress as the various\r\n  answers were extorted from him by degrees, may be faintly\r\n  traced in the report. His face was covered with sweat, and the\r\n  papers put into his hands shook and rattled.”—_Hist. Criminal\r\n  Law of England._ Vol. III., p. 399, note. “And yet, after\r\n  all,” as the learned judge adds, “he was right as to the time\r\n  according to the inspector at Euston. If Smith spoke the truth,\r\n  Newton could not have seen Palmer at all that night, and Mills,\r\n  if at all, must have seen him in Smith’s company. Mills never\r\n  mentioned Smith” (and was never asked by the defence if he came\r\n  with Palmer), “and Smith would not swear that she or anyone\r\n  else had seen him at the ‘Talbot’ that night.”\r\n\r\n  [62] Smith (not Jeremiah, subsequently examined, pp. 185-6),\r\n  when called for the defence, said that he sent the soup to Cook\r\n  by Rowley, but not to Palmer’s on the way.\r\n\r\n  [63] Palmer’s brother, in the letter to Lord Campbell, states\r\n  that Sanders, the trainer, if called (who had been examined\r\n  before the coroner), could have proved that Cook excused his\r\n  not giving him more than £10 when he came to see him, on the\r\n  plea “_that he had given all his money to Palmer to take with\r\n  him to London to settle his affairs_,” and that he was in\r\n  court at the trial, and when not called by the prosecution,\r\n  was sent out of the way to prevent his being called for the\r\n  defence.—_Letter to Lord Campbell_, pp. 18, 19.\r\n\r\n  He was called on his subpœna at the close of the evidence\r\n  for the defence (tenth day), and when he did not answer, the\r\n  Attorney-General said, “I should be deeply grieved if it could\r\n  be possibly thought that the absence of any witness could in\r\n  any way prejudice the prisoner’s case, and if my learned friend\r\n  makes any application on that ground it shall not be resisted\r\n  by me.” _No application was made._\r\n\r\n  [64] It was an acknowledgment that certain bills, of which the\r\n  dates and amounts were set out, were all for Cook’s benefit,\r\n  and signed either J.P. or I.P. Cook. Cheshire was under\r\n  Palmer’s influence, and a few days after opened Dr. Taylor’s\r\n  letter to Mr. Gardner with the account of the results of the\r\n  analytical examination, and disclosed them to Palmer, for which\r\n  he was prosecuted and punished.\r\n\r\n  [65] Whilst Palmer was in Stafford jail, inquests were held on\r\n  the bodies of his wife and his brother Walter. In the first\r\n  case there was no manner of doubt that she had been gradually\r\n  dosed to death by antimony. In that of the brother, the\r\n  analysis failed to detect any poison, a fact probably accounted\r\n  for by the length of time that had elapsed since the death and\r\n  the action of the lead coffin, if prussic acid was the poison\r\n  used. In both cases, however, verdicts of wilful murder against\r\n  Palmer were returned. On the 21st of January Palmer was brought\r\n  up from jail as a witness in an action on one of the £2000\r\n  bills purported to be signed by his mother, the signature of\r\n  which was denied by her; clerks in banks and others who knew\r\n  her handwriting well also agreeing that it was a forgery. At\r\n  last Palmer was produced in custody. He entered in a perfectly\r\n  cool and collected manner, nodded familiarly to his friends in\r\n  the crowded court, and gave the following evidence in a low,\r\n  yet firm and distinct voice, without a sign of trepidation:—\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Edwin James_ (putting the disputed bill into his\r\n  hand).—“Is the signature of William Palmer, as drawer of this\r\n  bill, in your handwriting?”\r\n\r\n  _Palmer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n  _Mr. James._—“And did you apply to Mr. Padwick to advance you\r\n  money on it?”\r\n\r\n  _Palmer._—“I did.”\r\n\r\n  _Mr. James._—“Who wrote Sarah Palmer’s acceptance on it?”\r\n\r\n  _Palmer._—“Anne Palmer.”\r\n\r\n  _Question._—“Who is she?”\r\n\r\n  _Palmer._—“She is dead.”\r\n\r\n  _Question_.—“Do you mean your wife?”\r\n\r\n  _Palmer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n  _Question._—“Did you see her write it?”\r\n\r\n  _Palmer._—“Yes.”\r\n\r\n  The action was, of course, at once abandoned, and no further\r\n  proceedings taken on the other bills bearing the mother’s name.\r\n\r\n  [66] See Lord Campbell’s correction of this.—_Judge’s charge,\r\n  post._\r\n\r\n  [67] _Ante_, pp. 185 and 186, note.\r\n\r\n  [68] See the suggestion of Dr. Guy, that the death was probably\r\n  due to morphia, and the remarks thereon in Chapter V., _post_.\r\n\r\n  [69] On this point, which was also put very strongly by Lord\r\n  Campbell in his charge, the prisoner’s brother, in his letter\r\n  to that judge, accuses the prosecution of cunningly keeping\r\n  back a witness of the name of Cockayne, who had been examined\r\n  before the coroner and whose deposition was before the Court,\r\n  who would have explained the use for which the strychnia was\r\n  bought. “Had he been, as he ought to have been called, he\r\n  would have proved that he kept a gun loaded in the stable, by\r\n  order of my brother, to shoot the dogs that worried his brood\r\n  mares, and that he also threatened to poison them, and that\r\n  the strychnia was purchased for that object, and that he had\r\n  missed dogs since then, which had been in the habit of prowling\r\n  about the pastures and hunting the mares.” He also accounts\r\n  for the non-production of poisoned dogs, by the “medical fact\r\n  that they go away to die in secret, concealed and quiet places,\r\n  where they die undiscovered, and would be mortally attacked in\r\n  so short a time that they could not get to their own home.” He\r\n  further accuses them of sending this witness, and Sanders the\r\n  trainer, who would have proved that Cook told him he had given\r\n  Palmer all his money, out of the way, so that the prisoner’s\r\n  solicitor could not call them for the defence.—_Letter to Lord\r\n  Campbell_, pp. 17, 19. But see _ante_, p. 188, note.\r\n\r\n  [70] See _ante_, p. 216, note, on the evidence of a witness,\r\n  Cockayne, who was called before the coroner.\r\n\r\n  [71] The prisoner’s brother, on the contrary, says that he\r\n  distinctly, in a most solemn interview, declared his “perfect\r\n  guiltlessness of blood.” The same writer unfortunately lessens\r\n  the value of his other statements by a coarse attack on Lord\r\n  Campbell as a worthy successor of Jeffries, and imputes to him\r\n  and Baron Alderson a deliberate intention to force the jury\r\n  to a conviction. As I had not the advantage of being present\r\n  at the trial, I can only say nothing of this appears in any\r\n  of the reports of the trial which I have collated, and whilst\r\n  on the contrary we now have the evidence of an experienced\r\n  criminal lawyer, who saw and heard all. Still, however, remains\r\n  the great difficulty that strychnia, as every analytical\r\n  chemist will testify, ought to have been found, if it had been\r\n  given, though the failure to discover it does not conclusively\r\n  negative the probability of it having been administered. Dr.\r\n  Guy has suggested that morphia might have been the cause,\r\n  introduced into the pills, a point of which would seem to be\r\n  made in Serjeant Shee’s speech, and which would account for\r\n  Palmer’s statement that Cook was not killed by strychnia, and\r\n  with his wish for a further examination of the body by Mr.\r\n  Herapath.—_Hist. of Crim. Law of England._ Vol. III., pp.\r\n  423-4. See on this point Chapter V.\r\n\r\n  [72] For the report of this trial I have relied on the\r\n  apparently verbatim report in the _Times_ (probably from the\r\n  pen of the late Mr. Campbell Forster), collated with that\r\n  in the Annual Register of 1856, and with the Summary by Mr.\r\n  Justice Stephen based on the notes of the presiding judge.\r\n\r\n  [73] Mrs. Mary Wood. Mr. Overend objected to this witness being\r\n  asked as to her opinion of Dove’s state of mind, on the ground\r\n  that she was not a skilled witness. The objection was allowed\r\n  by Mr. Baron Bramwell, but on the suggestion of the judge, not\r\n  persevered in by the prosecution.\r\n\r\n  [74] Charles Harrison.\r\n\r\n  [75] These strong expressions were not supported by any\r\n  specific proof worth reporting. Mr. H. admitted he used to flog\r\n  him, but added, “I flogged him till I was satisfied there was\r\n  a want of reason, but not after.” He admitted that he flogged\r\n  him slightly (perhaps a stroke or two) the day before he\r\n  left.—_Stephens’ Summary_. Vol. III., p. 430.\r\n\r\n  [76] He used to point loaded fire-arms at his servants, and\r\n  threaten to shoot unoffending persons: tell strange stories of\r\n  being followed by robbers: wander about his fields without an\r\n  object.\r\n\r\n  [77] Evidence of his nurse, Mrs. Wood, Mr. Highley, Mr. C.\r\n  Harrison, Mr. Lord, and the servants at Whitwell Farm (James\r\n  Shaw, Mary Peek, Robert and William Tomlinson, Emma Spence,\r\n  and Emma and Fanny Wilson) called for the defence, and\r\n  cross-examination of Elizabeth Fisher, who had been his servant\r\n  at Normanton and Leeds, Mrs. Thornhill, charwoman, generally\r\n  employed at the house at Leeds, and Mary Hicks.\r\n\r\n  [78] In his second confession he fixes the date of this as\r\n  Sunday, February 24, and that he took then about ten grains.\r\n\r\n  [79] On the Monday he wrote the following letter to his\r\n  mother:—“My dear Mother,—I am sorry to tell you that my wife\r\n  is very ill indeed. She came down as I thought this morning\r\n  much better, took a nice breakfast for her, and then she\r\n  commenced to play (the piano). After that she told Mrs. Fisher\r\n  (who is with us) that she would help her to make the beds,\r\n  but instead of that she was seized in her limbs and could not\r\n  stand, neither could she take anything. I went to Mr. Morley,\r\n  and I am sure I did not expect to see her alive when I came\r\n  back; but thank God she was alive, and that was all; she was\r\n  entirely prostrated. Mother has been to see her. If you would\r\n  like to see her you had better come by London for three and\r\n  sixpence. Harriet would like to see her, but she thinks of the\r\n  expense. My dear wife’s love to you and all at home, and accept\r\n  the same from your affectionate son, WILLIAM DOVE. P.S.—I hope\r\n  Mary will not make fun of this small bit of paper; it would\r\n  be over-heavy if I had not torn it off.” [This was one of\r\n  the letters referred to by Baron Bramwell as disproof of his\r\n  imputed idiotcy.]\r\n\r\n  [80] This witness and Mr. Morley, the surgeon, were called in\r\n  Palmer’s trial to state the symptoms observed in the course of\r\n  Mrs. Dove’s illness and death, without mentioning her name,\r\n  and Mr. Morley also related the results of the analytical\r\n  examination of her body in conjunction with Mr. Nunneley, who\r\n  was called on behalf of Palmer, and maintained that if it had\r\n  been given, strychnia must have been found by analysis six days\r\n  after death (pp. 124-8).\r\n\r\n  [81] “He told me,” said Harrison, “that he was afflicted\r\n  by devils, but that I had more power over them, and could\r\n  send them to frighten his wife from her bed to sleep with\r\n  him—believed they were in his house, and attributed thunder\r\n  and lightning to them. I attributed this to _delirium\r\n  tremens_. Told me he had sold his soul to the devil. I did\r\n  not encourage him to think I could rule devils; it was his\r\n  own fancy. I told him I would cast his nativity, but when I\r\n  saw the state of his mind I did not finish it.”—_Harrison’s\r\n  evidence—cross-examination._ But see Dove’s account of Harrison\r\n  in his confession, _post_.\r\n\r\n  [82] In this case Baron Alderson also decided that if the\r\n  witnesses were called by the defence, the person calling them\r\n  made them his own witnesses, 2 C. & K. p. 520. Baron Parke,\r\n  Justice Cresswell, and Lord Campbell agreed with this. See _R._\r\n  v. _Cassidy_, F. &. F. p. 79.\r\n\r\n  [83] To the schoolmaster at Abeford—conjuring tricks!\r\n\r\n  [84] Should not this be “at _some_ times.”\r\n\r\n  [85] “That would be _moral_ insanity.”—_Judge’s Notes—Stephen._\r\n\r\n  [86] I cannot find in the reports to what particular act this\r\n  question refers.\r\n\r\n  [87] “The suggestion of Dr. Williams,” says Judge Stephen,\r\n  “that Dove had allowed his mind to dwell on his wife’s death\r\n  till at last he became the victim of an uncontrollable\r\n  propensity to kill her, if correct, would not prove that his\r\n  act was not voluntary. It is setting and keeping the mind in\r\n  motion towards an object plainly conceived that constitutes the\r\n  mental part of an act. Every act becomes irrevocable before it\r\n  is consummated. If a man, for example, strikes another, he may\r\n  repent while his arm is falling; but there is a point at which\r\n  he can no more deprive his arm of the impetus with which he has\r\n  animated it, than he can divert from its course a bullet which\r\n  has been fired from a rifle. Suppose he deals with his mind in\r\n  this manner at an earlier stage of the proceeding, and so fills\r\n  himself with a passionate, intense longing for the forbidden\r\n  object or result, that he becomes, as it were, a mere machine\r\n  in his own hands. Is not the case precisely similar, and does\r\n  not the action continue to be voluntary and wilful, although\r\n  the act of volition which made it irrevocable preceded its\r\n  completion by a longer interval than usual?\r\n\r\n  “It must, however, be remembered, that the proof that\r\n  Dove’s propensity was uncontrollable was very defective. An\r\n  uncontrollable propensity, which accidental difficulties or the\r\n  fear of detection constantly control and divert for a time, is\r\n  an inconceivable state of mind. Is there the smallest reason\r\n  to suppose that, if Mrs. Dove had met with a fatal accident,\r\n  and had been lying in bed dying before her husband gave her\r\n  any poison, his uncontrollable propensity to kill her would\r\n  have induced him to give her poison nevertheless? If not, the\r\n  propensity was like any other wicked feeling. It was certainly\r\n  uncontrolled, and it may probably have been strong, but that is\r\n  different to uncontrollable.”—_History of the Criminal Law of\r\n  England_, by Mr. Justice Stephen. Vol. III., p. 435-6.\r\n\r\n  [88] Baron Bramwell especially called attention to the letter\r\n  of the prisoner to his mother of the 25th of February,\r\n  describing his wife’s first attack (see _ante_, note p. 237),\r\n  and that to the Witchman, Harrison, asking him, in replying\r\n  about his nativity, to “write in milk, or lemon, or anything\r\n  else that would not show till put to the fire.”\r\n\r\n  [89] This was proved at the trial by the Fishers.\r\n\r\n  [90] Mr. Morley’s pupil had shown it to him; proved at the\r\n  trial.\r\n\r\n  [91] That would be February the 23rd, when Fisher’s mother come\r\n  to Dove’s to take her daughter’s place, and the first attack\r\n  was when Mrs. Dove fell whilst helping to make the beds on\r\n  the following Monday. Throughout his statement Dove is very\r\n  confused as to dates. The tasting by Mrs. Witham was several\r\n  days after this.\r\n\r\n  [92] Mrs. Witham states (see her evidence) that she gave her\r\n  medicine at 3.30 P.M., and she seemed better for it.\r\n\r\n  [93] In his comments on this extraordinary case, Mr. Justice\r\n  Stephen—after noting Dove’s predisposition to madness in his\r\n  infancy; the fact that the symptoms of the disease exhibited\r\n  themselves at frequent intervals, yet never reached such a\r\n  pitch as to induce his friends to treat him as a madman; the\r\n  prurience with which he dwelt on the prospect of his wife’s\r\n  death; the forming of the design of putting her to death, and\r\n  the deliberate contrivance and precaution with which he carried\r\n  it out—says:—“In this state of things can he be said to have\r\n  known, in the wider sense of the words, that his act was wrong?\r\n  He obviously knew that it was wrong in the sense that people\r\n  generally consider it so; but was he capable of thinking,\r\n  like an ordinary man, of the reasons why murder is wrong, and\r\n  of applying these reasons to his conduct? There was evidence\r\n  both ways. His irrationality, however, was occasional, and he\r\n  appears to have acted rationally enough as a rule, and to have\r\n  transacted all the common affairs of life. Did, then, this act\r\n  belong to the rational or irrational part of his conduct? Every\r\n  circumstance connected with it referred it to the former. It\r\n  was a continued series of deliberate and repeated attempts,\r\n  fully completed at last.”—_History of the Criminal Law._ Vol.\r\n  III., pp. 435-6.\r\n\r\n  [94] This is probably an error of the reporter—rigid(?)\r\n\r\n  [95] The pills were produced at the inquest, and seen there by\r\n  Dr. Lees, but not submitted for analysis, either to him or Dr.\r\n  Bernays.\r\n\r\n  [96] In this the presence of strychnia was very distinct.\r\n\r\n  [97] The important evidence of this witness is given very\r\n  briefly on the report of the trial. From the notes of the\r\n  analyses made at the time in the laboratory I have been enabled\r\n  to give it in greater detail.\r\n\r\n  [98] Morphia gives with nitric acid a deep orange unchanged by\r\n  stannous chloride.\r\n\r\n  [99] See also case of Agnes Sennett, p. 121.\r\n\r\n  [100] A striking case of cure by chloroform is given in the\r\n  _London Med. Gazette_ for 1850, p. 187, quoted from the _Boston\r\n  Med. Journal_, July, 1850.\r\n\r\n  [101] Palmer administered to Cook so few pills, that unless\r\n  these consisted of solid morphia, which is impossible, they\r\n  could not much affect the above conclusion.\r\n\r\n  [102] The words “causing to be administered” were struck out on\r\n  the objection of Mr. Young that “they were not covered by the\r\n  major part of the indictment, and not material in any way.”\r\n\r\n  [103] This was distinctly denied by Miss Giubilei, who had been\r\n  a pupil teacher at the school.\r\n\r\n  [104] Mr. Minnoch, on the contrary, said, “She accepted me on\r\n  the 28th of January, and then she and I arranged it on the 12th\r\n  of March. From the 28th of January to the end of March there\r\n  was nothing to suggest to my mind a doubt as to the engagement\r\n  continuing. I had no idea she was engaged to any other. _When\r\n  the marriage was fixed in March it was to take place on the\r\n  18th of June._”\r\n\r\n  [105] “But surely,” said the Lord Justice Clerk, “had such been\r\n  the case, she would never have wished to be ‘clasped to the\r\n  heart,’ as she expresses it in her letter, of a man whom she\r\n  had to inform that she was engaged to another, and that all\r\n  relations must be broken off between them.”\r\n\r\n  [106] On this latter matter and the identification of the\r\n  envelopes for the respective letters much time was occupied.\r\n  In his charge the Lord Justice Clark said, that “though the\r\n  procedure adopted had been loose and slovenly, it did not\r\n  appear that the panel had suffered any prejudice from the\r\n  want of any of them. As to each letter being in its proper\r\n  envelope, in the first part of the correspondence, it did not\r\n  much signify whether such were the case; because there was no\r\n  doubt that those passionate letters written by the prisoner,\r\n  declaring such strong love for L’Angelier, and some of them\r\n  expressed in very licentious terms, were written by her at some\r\n  time or other.”\r\n\r\n  [107] “Arsenious oil applied to scalp to cure vermin caused\r\n  death on 10th day.”—Taylor, I., 254. “A solution to cure\r\n  itch caused death in two years.” _Cours de Med._, Leq.,\r\n  p. 121. “Arsenious acid and gum to the head, caused death\r\n  in 36 hours.”—_American Journal of Med. Science_, July,\r\n  1851. “When used as a face powder it caused poisoning\r\n  symptoms.”—Christison, p. 329. “Arsenical soap applied to\r\n  scrotum and axillæ produced violent pains in stomach, vomiting,\r\n  purging, but patient recovered in fourteen days.”—_Med. Times\r\n  and Gazette_, December 10, 1853. And see other similar cases in\r\n  list in “Woodman and Tidy.”\r\n\r\n  [108] See Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n  [109] Referring to the evidence of Dr. Penny, the Dean, in his\r\n  speech for the defence, said: “Here comes again another point\r\n  on which the evidence for the Crown is very defective, to say\r\n  the least of it. They knew very well when they were examining\r\n  the contents of this poor man’s stomach, and his intestines\r\n  generally, what was the arsenic that the prisoner had bought.\r\n  They knew from her own candid statement that she bought it\r\n  partly at _Murdoch’s_ and partly at _Currie’s_. If that arsenic\r\n  had been swallowed by the deceased, the colouring-matter could\r\n  have been detected in the stomach—there was one means of\r\n  connecting the prisoner with this poison which was found in\r\n  L’Angelier’s stomach, and a very obvious means. It may be very\r\n  well for Professor Penny and Dr. Christison to say now that\r\n  their attention was not directed to this matter. Whose fault\r\n  was this?—the whole thing was in the hand of the authorities.\r\n  They kept it to themselves—they dealt with it exclusively—and\r\n  they present this lame and impotent conclusion.”\r\n\r\n  [110] 14 Vict. c. 13, sec. 3: “Before the sale, the arsenic\r\n  shall be mixed with soot or indigo in the proportion of one\r\n  ounce of soot or half an ounce of indigo, at least, to one\r\n  pound of arsenic, except in cases where, according to the\r\n  representation of the purchaser, such mixture would render it\r\n  unfit for his purpose, when it may be sold in quantities of not\r\n  less than ten pounds.”\r\n\r\n  [111] In the _Edinburgh Monthly Journal_ of Dec., 1857,\r\n  Professor Christison gives the details of a case—not of\r\n  suicide—in which 90 to 100 grains were found, and the party\r\n  lived seven hours. In the case of _R._ v. _Dodds_, Lincoln\r\n  Assizes, December, 1860, 150 grains were found; in that of\r\n  _R._ v. _Hewitt_, or _Holt_, Chester Winter Assizes, 1863,\r\n  154 grains were found eleven weeks after death. Professor\r\n  Christison’s letter will be found in Appendix B., p. 358.\r\n\r\n  [112] In _Woodman and Tidy_ the following Table, showing the\r\n  solubility of arsenic, is given:—\r\n\r\n  ┌────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐\r\n  │                                │Transparent│  Opaque   │Crystalline│\r\n  │                                │   Form.   │   Form.   │    Acid.  │\r\n  ├────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┤\r\n  │(1) 1,000 grains of distilled   │           │           │           │\r\n  │    cold water, after standing  │  1·74 gr. │  1·16 gr. │  2·0 gr.  │\r\n  │    24 hours─dissolved          │           │           │           │\r\n  │                                │           │           │           │\r\n  │(2) 1,000 grains of boiling     │           │           │           │\r\n  │    water, poured on the acid,  │ 10·12 gr. │  5·4 gr.  │ 15·0 gr.  │\r\n  │    and allowedto stand─24      │           │           │           │\r\n  │     hours─dissolved            │           │           │           │\r\n  │                                │           │           │           │\r\n  │(3) 1,000 grains of water,      │           │           │           │\r\n  │    boiled for one hour, the    │           │           │           │\r\n  │    quantity being kept uniform │           │           │           │\r\n  │    by the addition of boiling  │  64·5 gr. │ 76·5 gr.  │ 87·0 gr.  │\r\n  │    water from time to time,    │           │           │           │\r\n  │    and filtered                │           │           │           │\r\n  │    immediately─dissolved       │           │           │           │\r\n  └────────────────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n  [113] As proof that L’Angelier’s first illness could not have\r\n  been on the night of the 19th and morning of the 20th, the\r\n  Dean referred to the fact that “on the 21st he ordered of his\r\n  butcher the largest piece of beef to be found in his pass-book\r\n  (7lbs.), and had fresh herrings in such a quantity as to alarm\r\n  his landlady, and a still more alarming quantity and variety\r\n  of vegetables.” “There’s a dinner for a sick person!” He also\r\n  said, “I give my learned friend the option of being impaled\r\n  on one of the horns of the dilemma—I care not which. He was\r\n  ill from arsenical poisoning on the morning of the 20th, or he\r\n  was not. If he was, he received arsenic from other hands than\r\n  the prisoner’s. If he was not, the foundation of the case was\r\n  shaken.”\r\n\r\n  [114] “What is the evidence of Mrs. Jenkins on this point?\r\n  She says he was in his usual condition on the 21st, when he\r\n  made that celebrated dinner, and she thought he was making\r\n  himself ill, and on that 21st he told her he should not leave\r\n  the house all the following day—the Sunday. He had, therefore,\r\n  I maintain, no appointment to keep, else he would never have\r\n  made that statement. On the 22nd Mrs. Jenkins says she had no\r\n  recollection of his going out. When he did go out at night, and\r\n  came in late, what was his habit? Mrs. Jenkins says he never\r\n  got into the house on those occasions except in one of two\r\n  ways—either he asked her for a check key, and got one, or Thuau\r\n  opened the door for him. He did not ask for a key that night,\r\n  and Thuau says he certainly did not let him in.”—_Speech of the\r\n  Dean of Faculty for the defence._\r\n\r\n  [115] To the evidence for these statements, the Dean of Faculty\r\n  objected that, though the guard of the train from Stirling\r\n  was shown the photograph of L’Angelier, and identified him\r\n  by it, the photo. was not shown to Ross—that Ross only spoke\r\n  of him as a foreigner—that no one at the place where he had\r\n  refreshments at Coatbridge was called to identify him—that the\r\n  “foreigner” told Ross he had walked from Alloa (eight miles),\r\n  and not from the Bridge of Allan, and that on the Friday or\r\n  Saturday previous he had walked into Stirling to try and get\r\n  a cheque cashed, and yet no attempt was made to show that he\r\n  did so. The witnesses for the defence, on the contrary (Adams,\r\n  Kirk, Dickson, druggists), were clear (Adams) that at half-past\r\n  five on Sunday, the 22nd, a gentleman came to his shop for\r\n  25 drops of laudanum; Dickson, of Batherton, two miles from\r\n  Coatbridge, that one whom he recognised as extremely like the\r\n  photo. of L’Angelier came for a similar dose at 6.30 on a\r\n  Sunday at the end of March, suffering from a bowel complaint;\r\n  and Miss Kirk, of the Gallowgate, Glasgow, who remembered a\r\n  gentleman, “as like as anything I ever saw” to the photo. of\r\n  L’Angelier, came about 8 P.M. on a Sunday night at the end of\r\n  March for a medicine, and got a white powder. [But it must\r\n  be remarked that, weak as this evidence was, it was weakened\r\n  by the admission of Adams that his customer did not complain\r\n  of illness—by that of Dickson that it might have been in\r\n  April, and by the inability of Miss Kirk to fix any date for\r\n  the occurrence, or to state what the powder was, though she\r\n  identified the purse from which the party took the money for\r\n  the payment of it.]\r\n\r\n  [116] On the question whether this letter brought L’Angelier\r\n  to Glasgow, the Dean referred to an expression in one of his\r\n  letters to Thuau, that he did not know what “Mr. Mitchell\r\n  could want with him,” and inferred that it might be to hear\r\n  about this person that he hurried up to Glasgow and called on\r\n  M’Alister, who probably might have given some information on\r\n  this point had he been called. [If so, why was he not called\r\n  for the defence?]\r\n\r\n  [117] “I have already shown,” said the Dean, “how constantly\r\n  she repeated to him her warning that on no account he was\r\n  to make the slightest noise of any kind. Therefore, without\r\n  previous arrangement, it does not appear to me possible\r\n  for these parties to have met on the occasion on which the\r\n  prosecutor says they did. If I am right in reading that\r\n  letter, she expected him on Saturday evening, and she waited\r\n  and waited, as she had upon Thursday, but he did not come. On\r\n  the Sunday evening she did not expect him. Why should she?\r\n  When he did not come on Thursday evening, when he did not\r\n  come on Saturday evening, why should she expect him on the\r\n  following evening? Well, then, that is the state in which her\r\n  expectations were on that occasion, and her conduct precisely\r\n  squares with it. She is at home in the family. They are all at\r\n  prayers at nine o’clock. The servants come up to attend prayers\r\n  with the family. Mackenzie, the suitor of Haggart, remains\r\n  below while the family are at prayers. The servants afterwards\r\n  go down stairs to bed, as usual—one after the other. The family\r\n  then retire to rest, and the prisoner, with her youngest\r\n  sister, goes to her bedroom about half-past ten or eleven. They\r\n  both get into bed about the same time; and, so far as human\r\n  knowledge can go, that house is undisturbed and unapproached\r\n  till the prisoner is lying in the morning side by side with\r\n  her sister, as she had fallen asleep. The watchman was on his\r\n  beat—he knew L’Angelier well—and he saw nothing.”\r\n\r\n  [118] Regarding this third charge in the light of\r\n  probabilities, the Dean said:—“If you believe the evidence\r\n  of the Crown, he suspected the prisoner of having tried to\r\n  poison him. But my learned friend says his suspicions were\r\n  then lulled—she had become more kind to him before he left\r\n  town. I thought my learned friend said he was brooding over\r\n  it when in Edinburgh, and spoke of it in a serious tone to\r\n  the Towerses. That was on the 16th of March, after which date\r\n  he had nothing to change his mind in the shape of kindness\r\n  from the prisoner, and therefore if he did once entertain the\r\n  suspicion, however unfounded, there was nothing to remove it\r\n  from his mind anterior to the 22nd of March. A man, whose\r\n  suspicions are excited against a particular person, is not\r\n  very likely to take poison at that person’s hand; and yet,\r\n  what are we asked to believe that he took from her hand that\r\n  night? That he took from her hand a poisoned cup, in which\r\n  there lurked such a quantity of arsenic as was sufficient\r\n  to leave in his stomach after death 82 grains; such a dose\r\n  indicating the administration of at least double—aye, I think\r\n  Dr. Christison said the administration of at least half an\r\n  ounce (240 grains)—and that he took it that evening from the\r\n  hand of the prisoner, with all his previous suspicions that she\r\n  was practising on him. It is a dose which, as far as experience\r\n  goes, was never successfully administered by a murderer. There\r\n  is not a case on record in which it has ever been shown that\r\n  a person administering poison to another ever succeeded in\r\n  persuading him to swallow such a quantity.” [But note as to\r\n  confidence after suspicion, that of Cook in Palmer, after the\r\n  suspicious illness at Shrewsbury.—See Palmer’s Case, _ante_;\r\n  and as to quantity administered by murderers, note _ante_, p.\r\n  319, and Appendix B., p. 358.]\r\n\r\n  [119] _Christina Haggart_, if she was to be believed, appears\r\n  to contradict this assertion. On _re-examination_ she said that\r\n  between a month and two before her apprehension Miss Smith\r\n  asked her to leave the back gate into the lane open after ten\r\n  at night, and stay in the kitchen a little, as she was to see\r\n  her friend. When she did so she saw no one in the lane, but as\r\n  she went into the kitchen, which was in front of the house, she\r\n  met Miss Smith going towards the back door. She heard footsteps\r\n  coming through the gate—that she stayed in the kitchen till\r\n  she heard Miss Smith go to her own room. She stayed about half\r\n  an hour. “_Charlotte Maclean_, the cook, stayed in the kitchen\r\n  with me at my request.” In this she was confirmed by Maclean,\r\n  but she could not say she heard Miss Smith in the passage,\r\n  though she heard her afterwards go to her bedroom. Miss Smith’s\r\n  statement to Dr. Meau is true, if the meeting took place only\r\n  at the back gate. The Lord Justice Clerk, however, spoke of\r\n  this evidence as proving that L’Angelier was in the house in\r\n  Blythswood Square.\r\n\r\n  [120] In a letter with post-mark September 18, 1855, she\r\n  alludes to some such threat, “Beloved, you are young, you\r\n  ought to desire life.” In another with post-mark October 19,\r\n  1855, she writes, “‘Before long,’ you say, ‘I shall rid you\r\n  and all the world of my presence.’ God forbid that you should\r\n  do this.” “This,” said the Judge, “was a common enough mode of\r\n  influencing females; and if such was his design, he seemed to\r\n  have succeeded.”\r\n\r\n  [121] As to the evidence for the defence, that L’Angelier had\r\n  on one occasion threatened to throw himself out of the window\r\n  at the “Rainbow” Tavern, his lordship observed, “As the witness\r\n  was in bed at the time the deceased had ample opportunity to\r\n  have thrown himself over, if he had been so inclined, before\r\n  the witness could interfere; and the jury would consider\r\n  whether, when going about the room in that excited state, he\r\n  had only thrown open the window to get air. As to the other\r\n  stories that he would drown himself, if jilted, they did not\r\n  amount to much, as on one occasion he had been jilted, and\r\n  had not drowned himself. You will consider whether all this\r\n  is merely the vapouring of a loose, talkative man, fond of\r\n  awakening an interest in the minds of others about himself, or\r\n  whether it affords any indication that he was likely to commit\r\n  suicide. As to the evidence about giving arsenic to horses in\r\n  France, which would be useless unless given constantly, he did\r\n  not see its importance. If he was in the habit of taking it in\r\n  small quantities, he knew its qualities, and therefore this\r\n  did not aid the notion that he took an immense quantity on the\r\n  22nd to destroy himself. No doubt the prisoner was not bound to\r\n  prove that he poisoned himself, but it was a hazardous thing to\r\n  set up a defence that L’Angelier went out that night carrying\r\n  such a quantity of arsenic in his pocket, and that he swallowed\r\n  it, how, when, and where, no human being could conceive.”\r\n\r\n  [122] “It is very difficult,” said the learned Judge, “to\r\n  say what the exasperated feelings of a female placed in such\r\n  a situation as this woman was might not lead her to do. And\r\n  here it is that the correspondence becomes of the utmost\r\n  importance, as shewing what feelings she cherished about\r\n  that time, what state and disposition of mind she was in,\r\n  and whether there was any trace of moral sense or propriety\r\n  to be found in her letters, or whether they did not exhibit\r\n  such a degree of ill-regulated, disordered, distempered, and\r\n  licentious feelings, as shew that the writer was quite capable\r\n  of compassing any end by which she could avoid exposure and\r\n  disgrace, and of cherishing any feeling of revenge which such\r\n  treatment might excite in her mind, driven nearly to madness\r\n  by the thought of what might follow the revelation of this\r\n  correspondence. We have heard a good deal said by the Dean\r\n  of Faculty as to the character of this person: we have no\r\n  evidence on the subject, except what these letters exhibit,\r\n  and no witness to character is brought; and certainly these\r\n  letters exhibit as extraordinary a frame of mind and of passion\r\n  as perhaps ever appeared in a court of justice. Can you be\r\n  surprised, that after such letters as those of the 29th April\r\n  and 3rd May (inviting him in very plain terms to meet her for\r\n  that purpose at the garden gate of the country house), that\r\n  on the 6th May, three days afterwards, he got possession of\r\n  her person? On the 7th she again writes, and in that letter\r\n  is there the slightest appearance of grief, of repentance,\r\n  of remorse? It is the letter of a girl rejoicing in what had\r\n  passed, and alluding to it particularly in terms which I will\r\n  not read, for perhaps they were never previously committed to\r\n  paper, as having passed between man and woman. There could be\r\n  no doubt of the state of degraded and unholy feeling into which\r\n  she had sunk, probably not the less so if it was produced by\r\n  his undermining and corruption.”\r\n\r\n  [123] If this was the use for which the prisoner bought the\r\n  arsenic, it is at least curious that she did not buy it until\r\n  the 21st of February, 1857, when she was endeavouring to get\r\n  her letters back from L’Angelier. The article in _Blackwood_\r\n  was in December, 1853. _Johnston’s_ Book was published in 1855,\r\n  and of the papers in _Chambers_, the first was in December,\r\n  1851, the second in June, 1853, and the third in July, 1856.\r\n\r\n  [124] Without wishing to fight over again the case of _Eliza\r\n  Fenning_, I would refer any one at all curious on this point\r\n  to a letter to the _Times_, quoted in the “Annual Register”\r\n  for July 29, 1855, from the Rev. J. H. Gurney, the nephew of\r\n  the well-known shorthand writer, in which it is stated, on\r\n  the authority of an extract from his uncle’s note-book, that\r\n  _Eliza Fenning_ did confess the crime to the Rev. James Upton,\r\n  a Baptist minister, whose chapel she attended, though she\r\n  subsequently maintained her innocence to other visitors.\r\n\r\n  [125] The learned Judge had previously said, “If this had been\r\n  an appointment about business, and it had been shown that a\r\n  person came to town for the purpose of seeing another, and he\r\n  went out for that purpose, having no other object in coming\r\n  to Glasgow, they would probably scout the notion of a person\r\n  saying, ‘I never saw or heard of him that day that he came;’\r\n  but the inference they were asked to draw was this, that they\r\n  met on that night, when the fact of their meeting is the\r\n  foundation of the charge of murder. Therefore the jury must\r\n  feel that the grounds of drawing an inference in the ordinary\r\n  matters of civil business, or the actual appointment of mutual\r\n  friends is one thing, and the inference from the fact that he\r\n  came to Glasgow, that they did meet, and that, therefore, the\r\n  poison was administered to him by her at that time, is another,\r\n  and a most enormous jump in the category of inferences.”\r\n\r\n  [126] Evidence of _Samuel Peckeridge_, his fellow-workman;\r\n  _Thomas Denman_, who had seen him near the reservoir on\r\n  Stamford Hill, on the 24th, vomiting, and going to the\r\n  public-house for brandy; _James Ashby_, another turncock of the\r\n  East London Company’s; _Mrs. Gillett_, and _Mr. Toulmin_, of\r\n  Clapton.\r\n\r\n  [127] On Dr. Letheby’s evidence, see remarks in Chapter VII.,\r\n  p. 395.\r\n\r\n  [128] _A. Andrews_ also proved that she had only objected to\r\n  the _post-mortem_ because she knew the deceased objected to\r\n  it; that she said “Thank God, I am innocent. Poor dear soul, I\r\n  loved him too well to injure him;” and had told him that Annie\r\n  had eaten the rest of the gruel, and that Mrs. Gillett knew it.\r\n\r\n  [129] _James Urry_, the secretary of the benefit society,\r\n  proved that the deceased had been insured in it nearly two\r\n  years—these would not have been completed until February 2nd,\r\n  and that, in consequence, she would be entitled to only £7 10s.\r\n  instead of £10. When he saw the prisoner she seemed absorbed in\r\n  grief.\r\n\r\n  [130] See on this the remarks in Chapter VII. p. 395.\r\n\r\n  [131] Tidy (Handbook of Modern Chem., 1878, p. 397) states that\r\n  1,000 parts of boiling water, digested for twenty-four hours\r\n  with the powder, dissolve—of the opaque form, 5·4 parts; of the\r\n  transparent, 10; of the crystalline, 15.\r\n\r\n  [132] In this case, which was tried before the late Lord\r\n  Denman, at the Summer Assizes, 1848, very many of the guests\r\n  at a dinner given to celebrate the election of an Independent\r\n  minister were seriously affected, and the death of the chairman\r\n  (an invalid) hastened, by eating of a blancmange made in the\r\n  form of a cucumber, surrounded with leaves—all of the natural\r\n  green colour. In colouring this sweet, emerald green, in which,\r\n  on analysis, 47½ per cent. of arsenite of copper was found,\r\n  had been used to such an extent that the colour was in some\r\n  parts half an inch in depth. The pastrycook (Franklin) had\r\n  been previously warned, by the chemist who sold it to him, of\r\n  its poisonous qualities, and for a time had discontinued its\r\n  use for eatables; and the defence was, that in this case his\r\n  apprentice (Randall) had used it under the impression that the\r\n  sweet was only for ornament. They were both found guilty of\r\n  manslaughter, and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment with\r\n  hard labour.\r\n\r\n  [133] According to the _Apotheker Zeitung_, No. 14, April\r\n  3, 1879, out of 118 samples of children’s toys officially\r\n  examined in 1878, 53, or nearly one-half, were found adorned\r\n  with poisonous colours. In the cases of 46 the vendors were\r\n  punished. As to dresses, see Chem. News, v. 114.\r\n\r\n  [134] In the case of _Maria Gage_, tried at the Summer Assizes,\r\n  at Ipswich, on the 2nd of August, 1851, for the murder of her\r\n  husband, it was proved that she had got a neighbour to purchase\r\n  for her a pennyworth of stuff for rats and mice, which was\r\n  found to consist of linseed with arsenic enough to kill half a\r\n  dozen men.\r\n\r\n  [135] “Considerable sensation has been excited by the report\r\n  that arsenic had been detected in the paper collars, &c.,\r\n  manufactured by a Leipzig firm. On a careful examination,\r\n  conducted by six of the most eminent chemists, the accusation\r\n  was proved to be utterly unfounded.”—_Chemiker Zeitung_, No.\r\n  45, 1879.\r\n\r\n  [136] In this case, which was tried in April, 1835, before\r\n  Sir Charles Wetherell, as Recorder of Bristol, a widow lady\r\n  of the name of Mary Smith, who had lodged with the prisoner,\r\n  was poisoned by her, in October, 1833, for the sake of the\r\n  money and other property she had with her. The accused was\r\n  proved to have purchased yellow arsenic about six days before\r\n  Mrs. Smith’s death, and to have been seen putting some yellow\r\n  powder out of a paper from her pocket into a basin of gruel,\r\n  after taking which Mrs. Smith was seized with dreadful\r\n  convulsions, and died. In consequence of suspicions created\r\n  by the prisoner’s subsequent conduct and false statements, a\r\n  _post-mortem_ was held of the body, exhumed fourteen months\r\n  after death. The report of this examination was very striking.\r\n  “A thick, yellow coating, like paint, lay on the mucous\r\n  membrane of the stomach, particularly over the pyloric third,\r\n  but it extended more or less with some small interjections of\r\n  unstained membrane to within two or three inches of the great\r\n  cul-de-sac.” The accused was convicted and executed.\r\n\r\n  [137] Phosphates give _nothing_ with sulphuretted hydrogen, and\r\n  a _yellow_ with silver nitrate.\r\n\r\n  [138] “A curious toxicological case is reported from Hamburg.\r\n  The body of a man who died in 1867 was taken for examination.\r\n  It was thought necessary to determine arsenic, not merely in\r\n  the corpse in question, but in the soil of the churchyard at\r\n  different distances from the coffin, and also in the body\r\n  of another man who had been subsequently buried in the same\r\n  grave. This latter body was perfectly free from arsenic,\r\n  which, however, was found in the first corpse in ample fatal\r\n  quantity (3·6 grains), whilst in the lid of the coffin and in\r\n  the adjacent ground very minute quantities were traced. Hence\r\n  the conclusion was fairly drawn that the man in question had\r\n  been poisoned with arsenic, and that a portion of the poison\r\n  had been gradually transferred from his body to the wood of\r\n  the coffin and the adjacent soil.”—_Chemiker Zeitung_, No. 7,\r\n  February 13th, 1879.\r\n\r\n  [139] See also a case in the _Gaz. Médicale_, 1850.\r\n\r\n  [140] When we bear in mind how small a space even 200 grains\r\n  of arsenic would occupy—not more than that of an ordinary\r\n  seidlitz powder—the suggestion of L’Angelier carrying this\r\n  means of suicide about him, when keeping the supposed\r\n  appointment on the Sunday night, is by no means improbable.\r\n  And when his evident tendency to attempt self-destruction,\r\n  when irritated or depresssed, is remembered, it is within the\r\n  range of probability, that, if either the meeting took place\r\n  and ended with a quarrel, or he failed to obtain a meeting,\r\n  in the excited state of mind which either circumstance would\r\n  have created, he in desperation swallowed the drug very shortly\r\n  before he returned to his lodgings, only to die. This is a\r\n  far more probable suggestion than that set up by the defence,\r\n  that he had been dosing himself with arsenic on the road from\r\n  Stirling to Glasgow. The difficulty is that purchases of\r\n  arsenic by L’Angelier could not be proved. But, looking to the\r\n  careless way in which it was exposed in the shops of some of\r\n  the firms with which he had relations (evidence of _Fleming_\r\n  and _Townsend_), he might have got it from thence, without its\r\n  being known, or he might have purchased it in Edinburgh on\r\n  his visit there, where he could not be easily recognised. He\r\n  certainly had an unwholesome hankering after this drug.—G. L. B.\r\n\r\n  [141] To the medical profession, for whose use, as well as for\r\n  that of their legal brethren, this volume is intended, any but\r\n  a detailed report of the medical evidence in this disputed case\r\n  would be useless.\r\n\r\n  [142] For the report of this trial I have relied on that\r\n  published in Edinburgh by William Kay, 1865.\r\n\r\n  [143] Evidence of _James Struthers_. Registrar of Deaths for\r\n  the Blythswood district of Glasgow.\r\n\r\n  [144] According to _Mary Patterson_, Mrs. Taylor was in the\r\n  kitchen about 7 P.M., as well as usual, only appearing a little\r\n  peevish in consequence of her night-watching. _Mary McLeod_\r\n  met her going up stairs from the consulting-room about nine\r\n  o’clock, and in a short time her bell rang, and she found her\r\n  in her daughter’s bedroom asking for hot water to make her\r\n  vomit, when she desired her to go for the doctor.\r\n\r\n  [145] See evidence, _ante_, p. 414 (note), of _McLeod_ and\r\n  _Paterson_, as to her health and actions during the evening\r\n  before her seizure.\r\n\r\n  [146] It was with reference to this visit that _Paterson_\r\n  afterwards expressed his opinion, that, but for the accident of\r\n  meeting Pritchard, he would not have been asked to visit his\r\n  wife. This was severely commented on by Mr. R. Clark as showing\r\n  the ill-feeling towards the prisoner which was imputed to the\r\n  witness.\r\n\r\n  [147] It was proved that he kept large quantities of antimony,\r\n  poisons, and other drugs in his consulting-room, though no\r\n  chlorodyne.—_Evidence of McCall, Dr. Penny, McHattie, Foulger,\r\n  and Kerr._\r\n\r\n  [148] In a letter to his father-in-law on the 3rd of March,\r\n  Pritchard wrote: “I am very much fatigued with being up\r\n  with dear Mary Jane, who was very much worse yesterday, and\r\n  passed a wretched night. Wednesday has been a periodic day\r\n  with her during this illness, and she always dreads it. Her\r\n  prostration is extreme, and her appetite quite failed. _Dr.\r\n  Paterson has recommended Dublin stout and some very simple\r\n  medicine._”—_Evidence of Mr. Taylor._ Second day.\r\n\r\n  [149] On Dr. Paterson’s evident feeling against the prisoner,\r\n  the Lord Justice Clerk made the following remarks: “It is\r\n  said that he exhibited a strong feeling against the prisoner;\r\n  no human being could feel otherwise if he had formed the\r\n  impression that Mrs. Pritchard was being poisoned in the hands\r\n  of her husband, her medical attendant. It is said that he\r\n  exhibited this feeling in a marked unpleasant manner in the\r\n  box. That is a matter of manner, and, if the feeling existed,\r\n  I do not know that he could have made his evidence really\r\n  more valuable if he had concealed the existence of it. It may\r\n  be an unpleasant thing to see what is called an _animus_ in\r\n  a witness exhibited in the witness-box. If he has a feeling\r\n  strong upon him, and that on good ground, he may come into\r\n  the box and entirely suppress all appearance of it, because\r\n  he has more command of his feeling, or a better manner of\r\n  concealing it. The fact remains, that if he takes up the\r\n  position I have described, he cannot, as a man of ordinary\r\n  feeling, feel otherwise than unfavourably prepossessed against\r\n  the prisoner.” Again, on his concealment of his suspicions,\r\n  the Judge said: “Now, he thought it consistent with his\r\n  professional duty—and I must also add with his duty as a\r\n  citizen of this country—to keep this opinion to himself. In\r\n  that I cannot say he did right. I should be very sorry to lead\r\n  you to think so. I care not for professional etiquette, or\r\n  professional rule. There is a rule of life and a consideration\r\n  far higher than these—the duty that every citizen of this\r\n  country, that every right-minded man owes to his neighbour—to\r\n  prevent the destruction of human life in this world, and in\r\n  that duty I cannot but say that Dr. Paterson has failed. Now\r\n  you will consider what effect that is to have, or whether it\r\n  is to have any effect on your minds. It is a very painful\r\n  subject—a subject which I would fain avoid, but the exigencies\r\n  of this case drive me to its consideration—and I am bound to\r\n  say that, because a man is so mistaken in regard to his duty to\r\n  his fellow-citizens, and his fellow-creatures, it by no means\r\n  follows that he is undeserving of credit as a witness. You may\r\n  con sider his evidence always in the light of that failing; if\r\n  you can see reason to modify anything that he says, because of\r\n  the existence of that failing, it is your bounden duty to do\r\n  that.”—_Charge of the Lord Justice Clerk._ Fifth day.\r\n\r\n  [150] From Western Branch of Glasgow Apothecaries’ Company,\r\n  September 19, 1864, 10 grains strychnia; November 4, ½ oz.\r\n  tincture conii (Hemlock); November 16, 1 oz. laudanum, 1 oz.\r\n  tartar emetic; November 24, 1 oz. tincture aconite; December 8,\r\n  1 oz. tincture (Fleming’s) aconite; December 9, 1 oz. tincture\r\n  conii. 1865: February 4, 1 oz. tincture conii; February 7, 1\r\n  oz. tartarised antimony, 1 oz. tincture of aconite; February\r\n  9, 1 oz. tincture of aconite; February 11, 1 oz. tincture\r\n  of digitalis; February 18, 2 oz. tincture conii (all sold\r\n  by the manager, _J. Campbell_); November 24, 1 oz. tincture\r\n  of aconite; December 9, 1 oz. tincture conii; February 4,\r\n  1865, 1 oz. tincture conii (sold by the assistant). Fleming’s\r\n  tincture of aconite is six times stronger than the ordinary\r\n  tincture.—_Evidence of J. Campbell._ From _John Currie_,\r\n  chemist in Glasgow:—1865: February 18, 2 oz. solution of\r\n  morphia and 1 oz. of Fleming’s tincture of aconite; March 8,\r\n  solution of atropine, 1 drachm, with 2 grains of atropia to a\r\n  drachm; March 13, ½ oz. of Fleming’s tincture of aconite; March\r\n  14, solution of atropine, 1 drachm, with 2 grains to a drachm;\r\n  March 16, solution of atropine, 1 drachm, with 5 grains to a\r\n  drachm.—_Evidence of John Currie._ Chloroform from July 13 to\r\n  December 9, 1864, 132 oz.—_J. Campbell._ This witness said that\r\n  2 oz. of tartarised antimony and about 1 to 2 ozs. of Fleming’s\r\n  tincture would cover the whole of their sales for a year, and\r\n  that the chloroform was also in excess of usual sale to one\r\n  person. For the defence it was proved that as much as 80 oz. of\r\n  Fleming’s tincture was sold by them within a year.—_Evidence\r\n  of John Simpson_, of Duncan, Flockhart & Co., of North Bridge,\r\n  Glasgow. And from 2 to 3 oz. of tartar emetic, besides larger\r\n  quantities to veterinary surgeons.—_Thomas Fairgreive_,\r\n  chemist, of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  [151] Evidence of _Alexander McCall_, superintendent of Glasgow\r\n  Police, and _John Murray_, an officer of the Sheriff—third day;\r\n  and reports of analyses by _Professor Frederick Penny_, same\r\n  day. Another specimen of tapioca, bought direct from Barton and\r\n  Henderson, had no antimony in it—Same witness.\r\n\r\n  [152] In reply to the Judge, the witness said that to take 7\r\n  grains of Fleming’s tincture Mrs. Taylor must have taken 100\r\n  drops of the poisoned Battley in a single dose, equal to a\r\n  teaspoonful; that 100 drops would not be an unusual amount to a\r\n  person accustomed to the use of it in moderation, and that many\r\n  opium eaters would not thank you for 100 drops. Aconite might\r\n  be given in divided doses, and not prove fatal, though the same\r\n  quantity was taken, the distressing effect of one dose going\r\n  off before the other was taken.\r\n\r\n  [153] _Dr. Gairdner_ stated that the only time he saw Mrs.\r\n  Pritchard was on the night of the 8th of February, and that\r\n  at that interview Pritchard told him Dr. Cowan had prescribed\r\n  stimulants, which he ordered to be discontinued, and no\r\n  medicine till he saw her again. Dr. Cowan said that he did\r\n  not see her until the 11th of February, “to the best of his\r\n  recollection, stopped all night, saw her again next day, and\r\n  left in the evening for Edinburgh.”\r\n\r\n  [154] _Dr. Paterson_ stated that he was called on the 24th of\r\n  February to see Mrs. Taylor, and then noticed the state in\r\n  which Mrs. Pritchard was, but not being asked did not prescribe\r\n  for her. He was called in to Mrs. Pritchard first on the 2nd\r\n  of March, when he prescribed powders containing camomile, blue\r\n  or gray powder, ipecacuanha, and aromatic powder, and he never\r\n  saw her again until five hours before her death. There is not\r\n  a word in his evidence of his having been previously consulted\r\n  about the use of Battley’s solution. The only interviews with\r\n  the prisoner, other than in the sick-room, were on the 1st of\r\n  March, when he met him in the street and he asked him to see\r\n  his wife, and on the 5th of March, when Pritchard called on\r\n  him, reported that the remedies had had a good effect, and Dr.\r\n  Paterson recommended their continuance.\r\n\r\n  [155] _Mary McLeod_ stated that she was in the bedroom from\r\n  the time Dr. Paterson left till Mrs. Pritchard died; that\r\n  she lay on the sofa, and that Pritchard told her to get the\r\n  mustard-plaster, and that it was applied to Mrs. Pritchard’s\r\n  stomach, and as it did not seem to do her good, she was sent\r\n  down again for another, and that when she and Mary Patterson\r\n  returned with it, Mrs. Pritchard was dead.\r\n\r\n  [156] From an account sent in to Mr. Taylor after his wife’s\r\n  death, the last purchases appeared to be:—18th January, 1865,\r\n  2 oz.; 29th January, 2 oz.; and 4th February, 2 oz. _James\r\n  Thomson_ stated that the last time he took the bottle to be\r\n  filled was on the night before Mrs. Taylor left for Glasgow,\r\n  and that for a year or so before her death he took the bottle\r\n  to be filled at first only once in every two or three months,\r\n  but latterly every two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n  [157] Evidence of _J. Foulger_ and _George Kerr_.\r\n\r\n  [158] This had previously been admitted by Dr. Penny.\r\n\r\n  [159] See remarks of the Lord Justice Clerk on the motive,\r\n  _post_, p. 445.\r\n\r\n  [160] See the argument of the Dean of Faculty imputing the\r\n  murder to McLeod, and the Judge’s charge on that point, _post_,\r\n  437-440.\r\n\r\n  [161] “Mr. Clark very properly said,” remarked the Judge\r\n  in this charge, “‘it is not his fault that he had abundant\r\n  opportunities. The relation existing between him and these\r\n  ladies is not his fault, and it was the existence of this\r\n  relation that gave him these opportunities.’ Quite true,\r\n  gentlemen—a very just observation; but remember, on the other\r\n  hand, that as the opportunities did in point of fact exist, he\r\n  cannot argue the case as if they did not.”\r\n\r\n  [162] “His possession of poisonous drugs,” said the Judge in\r\n  his charge, “to such an extent is not a suspicious circumstance\r\n  in the case of a medical man. They are in some degree\r\n  necessary; but the peculiar position of the matter in this\r\n  case—the nature of the drugs found in his consulting-room—is\r\n  certainly not to be lightly passed over, and still more the\r\n  nature of the purchases that he had been making from two\r\n  different apothecaries during the period to which our inquiries\r\n  particularly refer. In his consulting-room were found some\r\n  parcels of tartaric acid—not a very large quantity; some\r\n  phials, containing the remains of tincture of aconite and white\r\n  powder to the extent of three or four grains, containing a\r\n  somewhat strange and unexplained mixture of tartarised antimony\r\n  or tartar emetic and aconite. These things were found in his\r\n  consulting-room; but what had he been purchasing during the\r\n  period to which our inquiry refers? On the 16th of November\r\n  he purchased an ounce of tartar emetic, and upon the 7th\r\n  of February another ounce of the same poison—very unusual\r\n  quantities, as the apothecaries state. He also purchased\r\n  no less than 5½ ounces of tincture of aconite. That, the\r\n  apothecaries state, is a very unusual quantity for a medical\r\n  man to purchase: but I think it was a mistake in some respects\r\n  to push this statement to the extent to which the prosecutor\r\n  pressed it, because some of the other witnesses of the same\r\n  description said that for external application tincture of\r\n  aconite is sometimes used in considerable quantities, and if it\r\n  were used for that purpose we might account for such a large\r\n  quantity being used by the prisoner. But I do not think anybody\r\n  said, that two ounces of tartar emetic within a month or two\r\n  was a usual quantity for one medical man to use who was not in\r\n  the practice of mixing it at home, which the prisoner, in his\r\n  conversation with Dr. Paterson, says he was not. Besides, there\r\n  were other very strange purchases, which have no immediate\r\n  connection with this case—all of them strong poisons. He was,\r\n  therefore, undoubtedly possessed of a very large quantity of\r\n  different kinds of poisonous substances; but what is most\r\n  important is, that he was in possession of that very poison\r\n  to which the death of Mrs. Pritchard is undoubtedly to be\r\n  traced, and to which, in combination with others, the death of\r\n  Mrs. Taylor is to be traced—that is antimony. So that whether\r\n  we adopt to the full extent the suggestion of the Crown, it\r\n  appears beyond a doubt that some one had been practising a\r\n  system of poisoning, and that in the possession of the prisoner\r\n  were the agents necessary for carrying it on.”\r\n\r\n  [163] See, _post_, p. 446, the Judge’s remarks on this attempt\r\n  to throw the crime on McLeod.\r\n\r\n  [164] “It is said,” remarked the Lord Justice Clerk, “that\r\n  it would be very difficult that cheese could be poisoned by\r\n  antimony—very difficult to make a powder like tartar emetic\r\n  adhere to a piece of cheese in sufficient quantity to have any\r\n  effect, and that, if it did, it must have been visible to the\r\n  naked eye, because the cheese was yellow and the tartar emetic\r\n  was white. But we know from the evidence before us that tartar\r\n  emetic is easily dissolved, and the poisoned cheese could\r\n  easily have been poisoned by dipping it into a solution, quite\r\n  as easily as by dipping it into a powder.” _See Chapter IX._\r\n\r\n  [165] On this argument of the prisoner’s counsel the Lord\r\n  Justice Clerk said:—“It is difficult to offer an answer to\r\n  that. It is impossible to say what is the precise point to\r\n  which a poison of this kind will kill—what is the precise\r\n  amount that will at once destroy life as compared with\r\n  that which will only inflict suffering and torture. But\r\n  that Patterson did suffer these severe vomitings and pains\r\n  immediately after having tasted the egg-flip I suppose you\r\n  will not disbelieve, looking to the general character of the\r\n  evidence which she gave here as a witness.”\r\n\r\n  [166] With reference to the finding of the bottle of Battley’s\r\n  solution the Lord Justice Clerk made the following remarks:—“To\r\n  that scene I beg now to call your attention as given by Mary\r\n  Patterson. ‘When the bottle was found,’ she says, ‘he expressed\r\n  great surprise that she should have taken so much of its\r\n  contents in so short a time.’ Now he was quite aware, as you\r\n  will see by the evidence, that the old lady was in the habit\r\n  of taking a great quantity, and you will consider whether the\r\n  surprise was real or feigned. That is but a very small point,\r\n  however, in reference to this matter. His expression in regard\r\n  to it, seemed to me much more strong. He expressed surprise\r\n  at her having sent ‘a girl like that for it’—namely, McLeod.\r\n  I cannot see that there is anything so startling in that. Did\r\n  he mean to suggest that in sending such a messenger there\r\n  might be some mistake as to the contents of the bottle? Why,\r\n  what was it, ‘to send a girl like that?’ What was the harm of\r\n  sending a girl—an intelligent servant girl? What was wanted was\r\n  Battley’s solution, because it was what Mrs. Taylor wanted—was\r\n  accustomed to take. But still he thought that it was a very\r\n  serious matter—and further, that it was one of those things\r\n  that it would not do to have spoken of as having occurred in\r\n  his house—a man of his profession.”\r\n\r\n  [167] Had she survived the wife, would she not have been a most\r\n  important witness to aid in the conviction of the prisoner?\r\n\r\n  [168] For the report of this trial I have used that in the\r\n  Sessions Papers, Central Criminal Court, 1859, collated with\r\n  that given by Mr. Justice Stephen in his “History of the\r\n  Criminal Law of England,” vol. iii., p. 438, and that in the\r\n  Annual Register of 1859.\r\n\r\n  [169] According to her sister she had for some time suffered\r\n  from an affection of the uterus requiring the use of an\r\n  injection.\r\n\r\n  [170] The prisoner called on the solicitor on the Saturday\r\n  and asked him to come up the next day to draw the will, to\r\n  which he consented on the prisoner’s representation of the\r\n  state of the lady—but wished a medical man to be present. The\r\n  prisoner, however, assured him it was quite unnecessary, as\r\n  she was suffering only from diarrhœa, and was quite in her\r\n  right mind. “I went,” said the witness, “to the prisoner’s\r\n  lodging, and he informed me that they were not married, which\r\n  was another reason why he did not wish a medical man to be\r\n  present. I then went up to the bedroom of the deceased, and\r\n  the prisoner said to her, ‘My dear, this is the gentleman who\r\n  has come to make your will.’ She bowed, and handed me the\r\n  paper which I had seen on Saturday. I looked at it, and asked\r\n  her if that was what she wished, and read it to her, and she\r\n  said it was quite correct, except that she wished to leave a\r\n  brooch to a friend. I then drew up the will in accordance with\r\n  her instructions, in a lower room. The prisoner was with me,\r\n  and, when the will had been drawn up, said the daughter of the\r\n  landlady could be one of the witnesses, and he supposed I could\r\n  say it was some Chancery paper. I told him that would not do.\r\n  She must know it was a will, and he replied, ‘Oh, very well.’\r\n  Shortly afterwards the deceased executed the will, and I and\r\n  Miss Wheatley attested it, and I handed the document to the\r\n  prisoner, who paid me my fee. She appeared perfectly competent\r\n  to make a will.”—_Evidence of Mr. Senior._ The will was proved\r\n  by Smethurst, notwithstanding opposition, after his punishment\r\n  for bigamy.\r\n\r\n  [171] From the sudden and serious illness of one of the jurors,\r\n  however, the examination of the witnesses had to be suspended,\r\n  and the trial adjourned to the first day of the next Session.\r\n  Eventually he was put on his trial, before another jury, on\r\n  the 15th of August. As the statement of Serjeant Ballantine\r\n  was fully confirmed by the witnesses, the landladies of the\r\n  respective lodgings, and the sister, it will be necessary only\r\n  to report the medical evidence.\r\n\r\n  [172] It was apparently with reference to this case that the\r\n  name of a _Dr. Barker_, of _Bedford_, was repeatedly mentioned,\r\n  but he was not called to confirm or explain the supposed\r\n  instance of dysentery in early pregnancy.\r\n\r\n  [173] It must be borne in mind that there was no error in this\r\n  experiment, and that it was never suggested that the arsenic\r\n  in this case came from the copper, as it was not destroyed, as\r\n  when the bottle of chlorate of potash was afterwards tested\r\n  with copper gauze, which was destroyed by it, and the arsenic\r\n  in the gauze liberated. Serjeant Parry, of course, said that\r\n  the experiments in both cases were the same. So they were so\r\n  far as copper was used, but the presence of the chlorate of\r\n  potash in the other case made all the difference.—_See_ Chapter\r\n  IX.\r\n\r\n  [174] Had this discovery of arsenic not been erroneous, the\r\n  gap in the evidence, as to the possession of the poison by the\r\n  prisoner in a form most likely to be administered, would have\r\n  been filled up. It in no way, however, militated against the\r\n  discovery of arsenic in bottle 2. See _post_, Chap. IX., how\r\n  far Mr. Herapath was correct in asserting that more arsenic was\r\n  found than could have been released from the copper. In his\r\n  statement before the committing magistrates, on the 20th of\r\n  May, Serjeant Ballantine stated that bottle 21 had originally\r\n  been sent by Dr. Julius with a quinine mixture.\r\n\r\n  [175] On farther _cross-examination, Professor Brande_ said\r\n  that the copper he used in Reinsch’s test was generally rolled\r\n  down from a halfpenny, which he considered pure enough for the\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n  [176] But see his evidence, Palmer’s trial, p. 175, _ante_.\r\n\r\n  [177] _Handbuch der Pathologischen Anatomie_, by Baron Carl von\r\n  Rokitansky, Vienna, 1842-46, of which a translation by various\r\n  English medical men of eminence was published by the _Sydenham\r\n  Society_ in 4 vols. 8vo. 1849-54. It is still considered a\r\n  valuable book of reference.\r\n\r\n  [178] Subsequent to the verdict, in a memorial to the Prince\r\n  Consort, it was stated that “a lady friend of the deceased\r\n  was a witness,” to Miss Bankes’ knowledge, of the fact that\r\n  he was married already, and that she wished the ceremony to\r\n  be gone through. This lady, the memorial stated, was to have\r\n  been called, but Mr. Parry deemed it unnecessary. Upon this,\r\n  the Lord Chief Baron, in his report to the Home Secretary,\r\n  observed—“I do not believe Mr. Serjeant Parry gave any such\r\n  advice; but if it be true that any such evidence was ready,\r\n  why is not the lady friend named, and why is not her statement\r\n  or declaration now offered and laid before you? Such evidence\r\n  would, in my opinion, much alter the complexion of the\r\n  case.”—_Judge Stephen’s Hist. of Crim, Law_, iii., 461. [What\r\n  need was there of this evidence, when it had been proved that\r\n  for weeks together Miss Bankes had been lodging and associating\r\n  in the same house with Smethurst and his wife?]\r\n\r\n  [179] Not quite correct; on the prisoners representations of\r\n  the effect of the sister’s prior visit, Dr. Bird had advised\r\n  that she should not see her—at any rate at present.—_See his\r\n  evidence, ante_, p. 450.\r\n\r\n  [180] When _Dr. Julius_ was recalled, and stated that at the\r\n  first examination before the magistrates the prisoner urged\r\n  that it was necessary for him to go back to his wife; that\r\n  her death might be occasioned by his absence; and that it was\r\n  imperative that he should go; Serjeant Parry asked the witness\r\n  “whether the magistrates at that time did not direct or require\r\n  him not to interfere further with the patient?” To this he\r\n  replied—“I do not think it was addressed to him, but it was\r\n  addressed generally—it was in his presence. It might have been\r\n  a general direction, but he might have heard it.”\r\n\r\n  [181] “And not only in the evacuations, where small portions of\r\n  both were found?” They also laid great stress on the absence of\r\n  certain symptoms generally present in slow poisoning by arsenic\r\n  or antimony, or both.\r\n\r\n  [182] Or he might have added, the results of his experiments on\r\n  the evacuations, the correctness of which were proved by the\r\n  subsequent 76 tests by Reinsch’s method.\r\n\r\n  [183] “There were,” says Judge Stephen, “_fourteen_ reasons in\r\n  all assigned by Sir B. Brodie, _six_ in favour of the prisoner,\r\n  and _eight_ against him, of which only _two_ of the first and\r\n  _four_ of the second proceeded on medical or chemical grounds.\r\n  Until these are published it is impossible to judge fairly of\r\n  Brodie’s opinion.”\r\n\r\n  [184] _Stephen’s Hist. Crim. Law of Eng._, iii., 465.\r\n\r\n  [185] _Margaret Higgins_, a servant of Mrs. James, told a very\r\n  different story when put into the box for _cross-examination_, her\r\n  evidence not being taken for the prosecution. “On the morning of\r\n  the 10th I went into Mrs. James’s bedroom, about half-past eight,\r\n  and found two or three spoonsful of _warm_sago in a tea-cup by the\r\n  bedside, and two cups on the table. I took the cup from the chair by\r\n  the bedside down stairs, and ate the sago, which did me no harm.”[As\r\n  the prisoner said he took it in about 5 a.m., the sago, being in an\r\n  open cup, could not have been _warm_ at 8·30. It was also clear, from\r\n  other parts of her evidence, that she was in favour of the prisoner,\r\n  and anxious to throw the crime on the Cafferatas.\r\n\r\n  [186] Evidence of _Mrs. Cafferata_, _Dr. Cameron_, _Mr.\r\n  Clarence Pemberton_ (surgeon), _Mr. Tennyson Lloyd_\r\n  (solicitor), Inspector _Horne_, and detective _Kehoe_, who\r\n  proved the seizure of the medicine bottles, &c., and their safe\r\n  delivery to _Dr. Edwards_.\r\n\r\n  [187] “Free antimony” is what has not been taken up into the\r\n  system. “Eliminated,” which has been taken up into the system.\r\n\r\n  [188] For these acids I have used the systematic nomenclature\r\n  corresponding to the phosphates, as in Bernay’s “Notes for\r\n  Students,” in preference to Fremy’s original titles.\r\n\r\n  [189] Sulphuric acid may be freed from arsenic or antimony by\r\n  treating it with a few small fragments of charcoal and a little\r\n  rock salt, and boiling till the hydrochloric and sulphurous\r\n  acids have been expelled.\r\n\r\n  [190] Solutions of bismuth give with water white precipitates,\r\n  which are _not re-dissolved_ by tartaric acid.\r\n\r\n  [191] But it must be borne in mind that it was late in the\r\n  evening when the cheese was taken up to the bedroom, where the\r\n  light was not likely to have been strong; probably, on the\r\n  contrary, was carefully shaded, so as not to annoy the invalid.\r\n\r\n  [192] This bottle, according to Serjeant Ballantine’s\r\n  statement, had been sent by Dr. Julius to the deceased\r\n  containing a quinine mixture.\r\n\r\n  [193] Arsenic is tasteless. See evidence of _Professor\r\n  Christison_, in Madeline Smith’s case, _ante_, p. 322.\r\n\r\n  [194] This must be an error of the reporter, and must mean\r\n  McIntyre, who, with Dr. Bird, took possession of the bottles in\r\n  the bedroom. Dr. Bird delivered only bottles 1, 2, 3.\r\n\r\n  [195] In his evidence at the trial _Dr. Taylor_ said that he\r\n  found less than half a grain of arsenic, equal to 2¼ per cent.\r\n  in the copper dissolved—an impossibility.\r\n\r\n  [196] “An attempt,” says Mr. Justice Stephen, “was made to\r\n  account for the presence of antimony and arsenic alleged to be\r\n  discovered by Dr. Taylor, by the suggestion that it might have\r\n  been contained in the medicines administered to Miss Bankes\r\n  during her life. Arsenic is generally found in bismuth, and\r\n  for three or four days doses of bismuth, containing five or\r\n  six grains, were administered to Miss Bankes. Dr. Richardson\r\n  put the proportion of arsenic in bismuth at half a grain to\r\n  an ounce, and as an ounce contains 480 grains, each dose\r\n  would have contained about 1/140 of a grain of arsenic. If,\r\n  therefore, Miss Bankes took twelve doses of bismuth, she would\r\n  have taken between one-eleventh and one-twelfth of a grain\r\n  of arsenic in four days. This seems (for it is not perfectly\r\n  clear), from Dr. Bird’s evidence, to have been more than a week\r\n  before the day on which he obtained the evacuation analysed by\r\n  Dr. Taylor, and in 4 oz. of which he said he found nearly a\r\n  quarter of a grain.”—_History of Criminal Law of England_, Vol.\r\n  III., 459.\r\n\r\n  [197] The authorities relied on for this report are—(1) The\r\n  Central Criminal Court Sessions Paper, 5th session of 1882;\r\n  (2) the report in the _Standard_, in which the evidence is\r\n  in many points given more fully and clearly, including the\r\n  charge of the learned judge, in which he has kindly made some\r\n  corrections; (3) the Summary of Affidavits in support of the\r\n  petition to the Home Secretary, and the affidavits themselves,\r\n  70 in number, relating to his conduct and state of mind from\r\n  his youth to his conviction.\r\n\r\n  [198] _Dublin Medical Journal_, vol. xix., p. 403.\r\n\r\n  [199] On the death of Herbert John, in 1879, the prisoner had\r\n  received £479 India Stock and £269 Consols as his wife’s share\r\n  of that child’s property.—_Evidence of Mr. Chapman, and of Mr.\r\n  Ormond, the trustee._\r\n\r\n  [200] At Blenheim House he had two wheel-chairs—one on the\r\n  basement floor, and one on the bedroom floor. From the evidence\r\n  of _Mrs. Jolliffe_, at whose house the Chapmans lodged at\r\n  Shanklin, in August, 1880, he was then able to get himself up\r\n  and down stairs, but with great difficulty—crawling up on his\r\n  hands and knees. The spinal-curvature was gradually increasing.\r\n\r\n  [201] It will be seen later that he went through the form\r\n  of going to Wimbledon that evening with Mr. Tulloch, and\r\n  pretending to him that he had been to the school.—_See evidence\r\n  of John Law Tulloch, post._\r\n\r\n  [202] It is incorrectly stated, in the Summary of Affidavits,\r\n  that symptoms of poisoning did not begin till about\r\n  three-quarters of an hour after Lamson had left (p. 5).\r\n\r\n  [203] According to _Banbury_, a pupil, the boy had gone over\r\n  some examination papers with him after tea, and was in good\r\n  health and spirits. _Ball_, another pupil, gave the same\r\n  account of the boy’s health.\r\n\r\n  [204] The following is a list of the various articles delivered\r\n  to Dr. Stevenson for analysis:—“I received a number of bottles\r\n  and things from Mr. Bond. There was a bottle, duly secured\r\n  and sealed, and labelled ‘liver, spleen, and kidneys.’ That\r\n  was labelled with the letter A. I received a bottle labelled\r\n  ‘B,’ containing parts of small intestines, cæcum and colon,\r\n  and other parts of the intestines handed to Dr. Bond on\r\n  December 7. A third bottle was received, containing part of the\r\n  stomach. The fourth was a bottle secured, sealed, and labelled\r\n  ‘stomach,’ handed to Dr. Dupré by Mr. Bond on December 7th,\r\n  ‘D.’ The fifth was a bottle, sealed and secured as before,\r\n  ‘urine,’ handed to Dr. Dupré by Mr. Bond on December 7, ‘E.’\r\n  The sixth was a bottle, sealed and labelled ‘vomit;’ and on\r\n  another label, handed to Dr. Bond by Dr. Berry, December\r\n  6, ‘F.’ With this was a broken bottle, unlabelled, and a\r\n  gutta-percha wrapper, with two seals upon it, as Mr. Griffin\r\n  said. The next, ‘7,’ was a pill-box. It was secured and sealed,\r\n  and marked on the tape which secured it ‘C.B.’ That is the\r\n  pill-box (identified), and it is sealed in the same manner as\r\n  the wrapper of the broken bottle. ‘8’ was a newspaper parcel\r\n  sealed; ‘9’ was a brown paper parcel sealed; ‘10’ was a paper\r\n  parcel sealed. That was the whole of what I received from Mr.\r\n  Bond. ‘11’ I received from Inspector Butcher. That was opened\r\n  in the presence of Mr. Bond. It contained a box—(this is the\r\n  box)—with capsules in it. These capsules in the bottle were\r\n  some of the 107 capsules. There was a paper with some sugar in\r\n  it; some loose sugar, sweetmeat sugar. It contained a box of\r\n  quinine powders—(box identified)—labelled ‘quinine powders’\r\n  in writing, and had the name ‘J. W. Littlefield, Ventnor,’ in\r\n  print. There were four pills loose, one large comfit from a\r\n  Dundee cake, and one of the capsules contained what appeared to\r\n  be a pill, but which was really a similar comfit.”\r\n\r\n  “I don’t think you said what was in the newspaper parcel?”\r\n\r\n  “Eight packets.”\r\n\r\n  “What did the next parcel contain?”\r\n\r\n  “Nine packets. Packet 11 I received from Inspector Butcher on\r\n  December 12, marked ‘1 W. D.’ Inside that there were two little\r\n  tinfoil packages. Twelve was received from Butcher on December\r\n  14. It was a parcel labelled ‘The remainder of the sugar from\r\n  Dr. Bedbrook’s.’ Sherry from the decanter used by Lamson was\r\n  handed to me by Butcher on the 14th.”\r\n\r\n  “Did you later on receive this box and wafers?”\r\n\r\n  “Yes. It is marked 14.”\r\n\r\n  [205] See _post_, Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n  [206] See _post_, Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n  [207] The only evidence offered of his being at Shanklin on the\r\n  29th was an entry, in the “luggage and cloak office” book of\r\n  the Shanklin railway station, of a ticket having been issued\r\n  for luggage on the 29th August, in the name of “Lamson,” which\r\n  Mr. Poland proposed the porter (John Durrant) should use to\r\n  refresh his memory. As the witness could not identify the\r\n  prisoner as the party; without saying that it was strictly\r\n  inadmissible, Mr. Justice Hawkins considered it would have\r\n  little effect, and it was not pressed. Neither _Mr. Chapman_\r\n  nor _Mrs. Jolliffe_ saw him there on that day.\r\n\r\n  [208] Evidence of _William Tulloch_, and the pawnbroker,\r\n  _Robinson_, of Mortimer Street, Regent Street.\r\n\r\n  [209] There is some error in the report, as it was on the 1st\r\n  December that the prisoner wrote to the deceased that it was\r\n  too late to come that day; and Mr. Montagu Williams admitted,\r\n  in his speech, that the prisoner visited Wimbledon, and said\r\n  he went to the school on the 2nd. It must have been on the 2nd\r\n  that the witness went with him, the first time, to Wimbledon.\r\n  In his affidavit in support of the plea of insanity J. L.\r\n  Tulloch says, that “he saw Dr. Lamson at his brother’s (W.\r\n  Tulloch) for a few minutes on the 1st, and next day proceeded\r\n  with him to Wimbledon.”\r\n\r\n  [210] He had previously, on the 15th November, tried to change\r\n  a cheque for £15 at the American Exchange, in the Strand, where\r\n  a parcel had been sent for him.—_Evidence of Sidney Harbord,\r\n  the cashier._\r\n\r\n  [211] In the _cross-examination_ of _Mrs. Bowles_, the\r\n  school-matron, Mr. Williams endeavoured to get from her an\r\n  admission that the chemicals kept in the house for the purposes\r\n  of the scientific lectures were unsecurely kept, and within\r\n  the reach of the boy. _Mr. Bedbrook_, however, proved that\r\n  the button of the cupboard in which they were kept was 6 feet\r\n  6 inches from the floor It was also proved by the chemical\r\n  lecturer that the chemicals were only those acids commonly used\r\n  in the production of gases—acetate of lead, hydrochloric and\r\n  sulphuric acids.—_Evidence of Eastick and Whalley._\r\n\r\n  [212] In the boy’s box, on the ground floor, five pills mixed\r\n  with capsules were found. Twenty white powders, which were\r\n  numbered 1 to 20, were got from a box in the dining-room,\r\n  marked “J. Littlefield,” six of which—1 to. 6—were large.\r\n  The tin box with the two pills was handed to the police\r\n  inspector by Mr. Bedbrook, and a decanter of sherry from the\r\n  sitting-room, and the remainder of the sugar from the matron.\r\n  The evidence of _Inspector Fuller_, and other policemen, proved\r\n  that after being transferred from various hands, these things\r\n  were handed to the analyst, the Judge remarking on the want of\r\n  care in transmitting such important pieces of evidence, most\r\n  unnecessarily, through so many hands.\r\n\r\n  [213] The assistant at _Messrs. Bell & Co.’s_ stated the price\r\n  of atropia to a medical man as 4_d._ per grain—hence the\r\n  remark of Mr. Montagu Williams on the entry of “8_d._” “C.” in\r\n  the cash book of that day. The assistants at Messrs. Allen’s\r\n  altered their minds, on consultation together, within three\r\n  hours after they had told the police that it was atropia they\r\n  had sold to the prisoner.\r\n\r\n  [214] The fact of this poison having been sold by Allen &\r\n  Hanbury’s assistant to the prisoner, on the faith of finding\r\n  his name in the _Medical Directory_, was severely commented\r\n  on by the Judge. No doubt by 31 Vict. cap. 121, sec. 17,\r\n  Schedule A. Amendment Act, 32 & 33 Vict. cap. 117, sec. 3, it\r\n  is not required, in the case of a medical man, that the name\r\n  of the purchaser, the name and quantity of poison sold, and\r\n  the purpose for which it is to be used, should be entered, and\r\n  the signature of the purchaser is not required. The following\r\n  questions and answers call for publication:—\r\n\r\n  _The Judge._—“Suppose I applied and gave a name out of the\r\n  Medical Directory, and asked for two grains of aconitia, would\r\n  you sell it me?”\r\n\r\n  _Answer._—“If I were satisfied at the time you were a medical\r\n  man I should let you have it.”\r\n\r\n  _The Judge._—“Then anybody of respectable appearance and well\r\n  dressed might apply? and is there anything by which you can\r\n  satisfy yourself that the applicant is not an impostor and\r\n  telling you that which is not true?”\r\n\r\n  _Answer._—“The only thing would be the style of writing—whether\r\n  it was in the style characteristic of medical men.”\r\n\r\n  _The Judge._—“That hardly seems satisfactory.”\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Poland._—“The Act does not require registration in the\r\n  case of sale to a medical man.”\r\n\r\n  _The Judge._—“It strikes me that anyone could go, if he had\r\n  sufficient knowledge to write in the technical style of medical\r\n  men, and get poison without difficulty; and though the matter\r\n  is not before us in this case, it may be that the law requires\r\n  amendment in this particular.”\r\n\r\n  The jury also appended to their verdict a presentment urging\r\n  greater restrictions on the sale of poisons, with which the\r\n  Judge thoroughly agreed, and undertook to forward it to the\r\n  Home Secretary. During the present Session of Parliament\r\n  the Government have announced that a “New Poisons Act” is\r\n  preparing, and that it will deal with patent medicines. It is\r\n  imperatively required.\r\n\r\n  [215] Entries in the Register of the New York Bloomingdale\r\n  Asylum.\r\n\r\n  [216] Affidavit of Dr. G. H. Boyland, of Baltimore, U.S.,\r\n  a fellow student, and Dr. John Swinborne, of Albany, N.Y.,\r\n  Surgeon-in-Chief of the American Ambulance.\r\n\r\n  [217] Affidavits of Dr. Charles H. Von Klein, of Hamilton,\r\n  County Butler, U.S., Surgeon in the Russian army, and Dr. F.\r\n  P. Carey, of Auburn, N.Y., fellow surgeons with Lamson at\r\n  Bucharest.\r\n\r\n  [218] Statutory declarations of about thirty persons—friends,\r\n  servants, and such as occasionally came in contact with him\r\n  during his residence at Bournemouth.\r\n\r\n  [219] Ernest Juch, of 1, New Broad Street, journalist, and\r\n  formerly a medical practitioner, who met Lamson in New York,\r\n  August, 1881, and saw him daily for two months.\r\n\r\n  [220] Mrs. McElroy, when, with Lamson’s consent, taking\r\n  charge of his medicines, found among other things an unmarked\r\n  box of “sugar pills,” which Lamson said were either morphia\r\n  or quinine, he did not know which. On this evidence the\r\n  following remark is made on the accused’s behalf:—“After he\r\n  (Lamson) left, and when John was taken ill, several pills were\r\n  discovered on the table, which were not noticed while Lamson\r\n  was there. It is believed that as John was suffering from\r\n  indigestion (he had dined at one, and portions of his dinner\r\n  were vomited undigested at nine) he determined to take a pill,\r\n  and try with it one of the capsules just given him. John’s\r\n  symptoms of poisoning did not begin till about three-quarters\r\n  of an hour (_really twenty-five minutes_, see p. 520) after\r\n  Lamson left, and he lived for about four hours after, whereas\r\n  if he had taken the poison in the capsule, while Lamson was\r\n  there, it is almost certain that the symptoms would have set in\r\n  much earlier, especially considering the enormous quantity of\r\n  poison said to have been taken. He then, unhappily, selected\r\n  one containing aconitia. From the foregoing evidence of the\r\n  way in which Lamson used and prescribed aconitia, taken with\r\n  what Mrs. McElroy says of his ignorance as to what his own\r\n  medicaments contained, it might well be that he ignorantly or\r\n  insanely mixed these pills, and sent them to Percy John without\r\n  any murderous intent.”\r\n\r\n  [221] A sample of “English aconitine,” recently obtained\r\n  from Morson’s, was amorphous, slightly coloured, and gave\r\n  a red-brown colour, with all acids, even acetic; yet its\r\n  physiological action was perfect.\r\n\r\n  [222] In “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan” (Isabella L. Bird, 1880),\r\n  it is stated that the Ainos, an interesting race inhabiting a\r\n  part of that country, poison their arrow-heads with a paste\r\n  prepared from the root of a species of aconite, Aconitum\r\n  Japonicum.\r\n\r\n  [223] A servant girl was recently poisoned in New York by\r\n  repeatedly rubbing tincture of aconite on the gums to relieve\r\n  pain. She died in three days. (British Medical Journal, Aug.\r\n  26, 1882.)\r\n\r\n  [224] Woodman and Tidy, p. 393, wrongly give this as “one ounce\r\n  of the tincture.”\r\n\r\n  [225] The case of Reg. _v._ McConkey, already referred to\r\n  (_ante_, p. 515), furnishes us with an instance of aconite root\r\n  being administered with criminal intent, and with fatal result.\r\n\r\n  In Aug., 1882, four boys and a girl suffered severely from\r\n  chewing dried aconite root, which they had found in the street.\r\n  The symptoms, tingling and numbness, abdominal pain, nausea,\r\n  vomiting, giddiness, muscular weakness, pains in the legs,\r\n  and coldness of the feet, set in very rapidly, the greatest\r\n  delay being a quarter of an hour. There was no dyspnœa, and\r\n  the pupils in all were _widely dilated_. The treatment adopted\r\n  was the administration of emetics (sulphate of zinc and vin.\r\n  ipecac.), coffee and brandy, and castor oil. Recovery in two to\r\n  seven days. Quantity taken, “a very small piece.” (Brit. Med.\r\n  Journal, 1882, p. 1039.)\r\n\r\n  [226] An illustration of the dangerous character of these\r\n  preparations, and of the serious results which may ensue from\r\n  the mistake of a person ignorant of medicine, is afforded\r\n  by the following case, reported in the _Medical Times and\r\n  Gazette_, of January 22, 1853. An inquest was held on January\r\n  15th, 1853, to inquire into the death of Emma Forty, an\r\n  inmate of the Roman Catholic Convent of the Good Shepherd at\r\n  Arnosvale, near Bristol. The deceased suffered from tapeworm,\r\n  for which the medical attendant of the convent had prescribed\r\n  a decoction of pomegranate bark and quinine. According to the\r\n  general custom at the convent, the medicine was prepared by\r\n  Miss Ryder, the sister-attendant, who unfortunately took a\r\n  wrong bottle from the dispensary, and gave, instead of the\r\n  decoction, _a drachm of Fleming’s Tincture of Aconite_. This\r\n  mixture was given to the deceased on the Monday preceding the\r\n  inquest (Jan. 10th); and death occurred in about five hours\r\n  after the draught had been swallowed. After some remarks by\r\n  the Coroner as to the imminent danger of unskilled persons\r\n  being allowed to dispense drugs, the jury returned a verdict\r\n  that death was occasioned by the administration of aconite\r\n  by Miss Ryder, and expressed the opinion that much blame was\r\n  attributable to the authorities of the convent for allowing\r\n  persons, without the necessary knowledge, to dispense\r\n  medicines: they hoped that in future such a practice would be\r\n  discontinued.\r\n\r\n  [227] A report of the inquest is to be found in the\r\n  Pharmaceutical Journal, 1872, p. 618. The deceased was the\r\n  Hon. Gowran Charles Vernon, Recorder of Lincoln, and second\r\n  son of Lord Lyvedon. According to the evidence of a brother of\r\n  Mr. Vernon, the latter had for some time past complained of\r\n  pains in his head, and had been in the habit of using neuraline\r\n  with the object of relieving these pains. On returning to his\r\n  residence, after a walk with his wife, the deceased was seized\r\n  with a fit, and shortly afterwards died. The doctors considered\r\n  that he was suffering from neuralgia and epileptic fits.\r\n  Mr. G. Harley, M.D., M.R.C.S., stated that he had analysed\r\n  neuraline, and found it to be an extract of aconite, mixed\r\n  with rose-water; it also contained chloroform. The Coroner\r\n  (Dr. Lankester) said there was no doubt that the deceased had\r\n  expired from natural causes, and that he had been seized with a\r\n  fit of convulsions, from the effects of which he died.",
