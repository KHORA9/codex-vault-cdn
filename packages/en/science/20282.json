Y.,\r\n\r\n  _August, 1922._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\nThe ever increasing uses of steel in all industries and the necessity\r\nof securing the best results with the material used, make a knowledge\r\nof the proper working of steel more important than ever before.\r\nFor it is not alone the quality of the steel itself or the alloys\r\nused in its composition, but the proper working or treatment of\r\nthe steel which determines whether or not the best possible use\r\nhas been made of it.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the authors have drawn, not only from their\r\nown experience but from the best sources available, information\r\nas to the most approved methods of working the various kinds of\r\nsteel now in commercial use. These include low carbon, high carbon\r\nand alloy steels of various kinds, and from a variety of industries.\r\nThe automotive field has done much to develop not only new alloys but\r\nefficient methods of working them and has been drawn on liberally\r\nso as to show the best practice. The practice in government arsenals\r\non steels used in fire arms is also given.\r\n\r\nWhile not intended as a treatise on steel making or metallurgy in\r\nany sense, it has seemed best to include a little information as\r\nto the making of different steels and to give considerable general\r\ninformation which it is believed will be helpful to those who desire\r\nto become familiar with the most modern methods of working steel.\r\n\r\nIt is with the hope that this volume, which has endeavored to give\r\ndue credit to all sources of information, may prove of value to\r\nits readers and through them to the industry at large.\r\n\r\n_July_, 1921.\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n    I.

It is not always clear as to just what makes the difference\r\nbetween iron and steel. We know that high-carbon steel makes a\r\nbetter cutting tool than low-carbon steel. And yet carbon alone\r\ndoes not make all the difference because we know that cast iron\r\nhas more carbon than tool steel and yet it does not make a good\r\ncutting tool.\r\n\r\nPig iron or cast iron has from 3 to 5 per cent carbon, while good\r\ntool steel rarely has more than 1-1/4 per cent of carbon, yet one\r\nis soft and has a coarse grain, while the other has a fine grain\r\nand can be hardened by heating and dipping in water. Most of the\r\ncarbon in cast iron is in a form like graphite, which is almost pure\r\ncarbon, and is therefore called graphitic carbon. The resemblance\r\ncan be seen by noting how cast-iron borings blacken the hands just\r\nas does graphite, while steel turnings do not have the same effect.\r\nThe difference is due to the fact that the carbon in steel is not\r\nin a graphitic form as well as because it is present in smaller\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nIn making steel in the old way the cast iron was melted and the\r\ncarbon and other impurities burned out of it, the melted iron being\r\nstirred or \"puddled,\" meanwhile. The resulting puddled iron, also\r\nknown as wrought iron, is very low in carbon; it is tough, and on\r\nbeing broken appears to be made up of a bundle of long fibers.\r\nThen the iron was heated to redness for several days in material\r\ncontaining carbon (charcoal) until it absorbed the desired amount,\r\nwhich made it steel, just as case-hardening iron or steel adds\r\ncarbon to the outer surface of the metal. The carbon absorbed by\r\nthe iron does not take on a graphitic form, however, as in the\r\ncase of cast iron, but enters into a chemical compound with the\r\niron, a hard brittle substance called \"cementite\" by metallurgists.\r\nIn fact, the difference between the hard, brittle cementite and\r\nthe soft, greasy graphite, accounts for many of the differences\r\nbetween steel and gray cast iron. Wrought iron, which has very\r\nlittle carbon of any sort in it, is fairly soft and tough. The\r\nproperties of wrought iron are the properties of pure iron. As\r\nmore and more carbon is introduced into the iron, it combines with\r\nthe iron and distributes itself throughout the metal in extremely\r\nsmall crystals of cementite, and this brittle, hard substance lends\r\nmore and more hardness and strength to the steel, at the expense\r\nof the original toughness of the iron. As more and more carbon is\r\ncontained in the alloy--for steel is a true alloy--it begins to\r\nappear as graphite, and its properties counteract the remaining\r\nbrittle cementite. Eventually, in gray cast iron, we have properties\r\nwhich would be expected of wrought iron, whose tough metallic texture\r\nwas shot through with flakes of slippery, weak graphite.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the methods of making steel tools in use 100 years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe iron bars, after heating in charcoal, were broken and the carbon\r\ncontent judged by the fracture. Those which had been in the hottest\r\npart of the furnace would have the deepest \"case\" and highest carbon.\r\nSo when the steel was graded, and separated into different piles,\r\na few bars of like kind were broken into short lengths, melted\r\nin fire-clay crucibles at an intense white heat, cast carefully\r\ninto iron molds, and the resulting ingot forged into bars under\r\na crude trip hammer. This melting practice is still in use for\r\ncrucible steel, and will be described further on page 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORKING OF STEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nANNEALING, HEAT TREATING AND HARDENING\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nCARBON AND ALLOY STEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nSTEEL MAKING\r\n\r\nThere are four processes now used for the manufacture of steel.\r\nThese are: The Bessemer, Open Hearth, Crucible and Electric Furnace\r\nMethods.\r\n\r\nBESSEMER PROCESS\r\n\r\nThe bessemer process consists of charging molten pig iron into\r\na huge, brick-lined pot called the bessemer converter, and then\r\nin blowing a current of air through holes in the bottom of the\r\nvessel into the liquid metal.\r\n\r\nThe air blast burns the white hot metal, and the temperature increases.\r\nThe action is exactly similar to what happens in a fire box under\r\nforced draft. And in both cases some parts of the material burn\r\neasier and more quickly than others. Thus it is that some of the\r\nimpurities in the pig iron--including the carbon--burn first, and\r\nif the blast is shut off when they are gone but little of the iron\r\nis destroyed. Unfortunately sulphur, one of the most dangerous\r\nimpurities, is not expelled in the process.\r\n\r\nA bessemer converter is shown in Fig. 1, while Fig. 2 shows the\r\ndetails of its construction. This shows how the air blast is forced\r\nin from one side, through the trunnion, and up through the metal.\r\nWhere the steel is finished the converter is tilted, or swung on\r\nits trunnions, the blast turned off, and the steel poured out of\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nOPEN HEARTH PROCESS\r\n\r\nThe open hearth furnace consists of a big brick room with a low\r\narched roof. It is charged with pig iron and scrap through doors\r\nin the side walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--A typical Bessemer converter.]\r\n\r\nThrough openings at one end of the furnace come hot air and gas,\r\nwhich burn in the furnace, producing sufficient heat to melt the\r\ncharge and refine it of its impurities. Lime and other nonmetallic\r\nsubstances are put in the furnace. These melt, forming a \"slag\"\r\nwhich floats on the metal and aids materially in the refining\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nIn the bessemer process air is forced _through_ the metal. In the\r\nopen-hearth furnace the metal is protected from the flaming gases\r\nby a slag covering. Therefore it is reasonable to suppose that\r\nthe final product will not contain so much gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Action of Bessemer converter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Regenerative open hearth furnace.]\r\n\r\nA diagram of a modern regenerative furnace is shown in Fig. 3.\r\nAir and gas enter the hearth through chambers loosely packed with\r\nhot fire brick, burn, and exit to the chimney through another pair\r\nof chambers, giving to them some of the heat which would otherwise\r\nwaste. The direction is reversed about every twenty minutes by\r\nchanging the position of the dampers.\r\n\r\nCRUCIBLE STEEL\r\n\r\nCrucible steel is still made by melting material in a clay or graphite\r\ncrucible. Each crucible contains about 40 lb. of best puddled iron,\r\n40 lb. of clean \"mill scrap\"--ends trimmed from tool steel bars--and\r\nsufficient rich alloys and charcoal to make the mixture conform to\r\nthe desired chemical analysis. The crucible is covered, lowered\r\ninto a melting hole (Fig. 4) and entirely surrounded by burning\r\ncoke. In about four hours the metal is converted into a quiet white\r\nhot liquid. Several crucibles are then pulled out of the hole, and\r\ntheir contents carefully poured into a metal mold, forming an ingot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Typical crucible furnace.]\r\n\r\nIf modern high-speed steel is being made, the ingots are taken\r\nout of the molds while still red hot and placed in a furnace which\r\nkeeps them at this temperature for some hours, an operation known\r\nas annealing. After slow cooling any surface defects are ground\r\nout. Ingots are then reheated to forging temperature, hammered\r\ndown into \"billets\" of about one-quarter size, and 10 to 20 per\r\ncent of the length cut from the top. After reheating the billets\r\nare hammered or rolled into bars of desired size. Finished bars are\r\npacked with a little charcoal into large pipes, the ends sealed,\r\nand annealed for two or three days. After careful inspection and\r\ntesting the steel is ready for market.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC PROCESS\r\n\r\nThe fourth method of manufacturing steel is by the electric furnace.\r\nThese furnaces are of various sizes and designs; their size may be\r\nsufficient for only 100 lb. of metal--on the other hand electric\r\nfurnaces for making armor-plate steel will hold 40 tons of steel.\r\nDesigns vary widely according to the electrical principles used.\r\nA popular furnace is the 6-ton Heroult furnace illustrated in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nIt is seen to be a squat kettle, made of heavy sheet steel, with\r\na dished bottom and mounted so it can be tilted forward slightly\r\nand completely drained. This kettle is lined with special fire\r\nbrick which will withstand most intense heat and resist the cutting\r\naction of hot metal and slag. For a roof, a low dome of fire brick\r\nis provided. The shell and lining is pierced in front for a pouring\r\nspout, and on either side by doors, through which the raw material\r\nis charged.\r\n\r\nTwo or three carbon \"electrodes\"--18-in. cylinders of specially\r\nprepared coke or graphite--extend through holes in the roof. Electrical\r\nconnections are made to the upper ends, and a very high current\r\nsent through them. This causes tremendous arcs to form between\r\nthe lower ends of the electrodes and the metal below, and these\r\nelectric arcs are the only source of heat in this style of furnace.\r\n\r\nElectric furnaces can be used to do the same work as is done in\r\ncrucible furnaces--that is to say, merely melt a charge of carefully\r\nselected pure raw materials. On the other hand it can be used to\r\nproduce very high-grade steel from cheap and impure metal, when\r\nit acts more like an open-hearth furnace. It can push the refining\r\neven further than the latter furnace does, for two reasons: first\r\nthe bath is not swept continuously by a flaming mass of gases;\r\nsecond, the temperature can be run up higher, enabling the operator\r\nto make up slags which are difficult to melt but very useful to\r\nremove small traces of impurities from the metal.\r\n\r\nElectric furnaces are widely used, not only in the iron industry,\r\nbut in brass, copper and aluminum works. It is a useful melter of\r\ncold metal for making castings. It can be used to convert iron\r\ninto steel or vice versa. Its most useful sphere, however, is as a\r\nrefiner of metal, wherein it takes either cold steel or molten steel\r\nfrom open hearth or bessemer furnaces, and gives it the finishing\r\ntouches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--\"Slagging off\" an electric furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Pouring the ingots.]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the furnace reactions that take place the\r\nfollowing schedule is given, showing the various stages in the\r\nmaking of a heat of electric steel. The steel to be made was a\r\nhigh-carbon chrome steel used for balls for ball bearings:\r\n\r\n6-TON HEROULT FURNACE\r\n\r\n11:50 A.M.--Material charged:\r\n  Boiler plate   5,980 lb.\r\n  Stampings      5,991 lb.\r\n               -----------\r\n                11,971 lb.\r\n  Limestone        700 lb.\r\n12:29 P.M.--Completed charging (current switched on).\r\n 3:20 P.M.--Charge melted down.\r\n  Preliminary analysis under black slag.\r\n    Analysis:\r\n      Carbon      Silicon     Sulphur     Phosphorus  Manganese\r\n       0.06        0.014       0.032        0.009       0.08\r\n           Note the practical elimination of phosphorus.\r\n 3:40 P.M.--The oxidizing (black) slag is now poured and skimmed off as\r\n   clean as possible to prevent rephosphorizing and to permit of adding\r\n   carburizing materials. For this purpose carbon is added in the form\r\n   of powdered coke, ground electrodes or other forms of pure carbon.\r\n\r\nThe deoxidizing slag is now formed by additions of lime, coke and\r\nfluorspar (and for some analyses ferrosilicon). The slag changes\r\nfrom black to white as the metallic oxides are reduced by these\r\ndeoxidizing additions and the reduced metals return to the bath.\r\nA good finishing slag is creamy white, porous and viscous. After\r\nthe slag becomes white, some time is necessary for the absorption\r\nof the sulphur in the bath by the slag.\r\n\r\nThe white slag disintegrates to a powder when exposed to the atmosphere\r\nand has a pronounced odor of acetylene when wet.\r\n\r\nFurther additions of recarburizing material are added as needed to\r\nmeet the analysis. The further reactions are shown by the following:\r\n\r\n3:40 P.M.--Recarburizing material added:\r\n  130 lb. ground electrodes.\r\n   25 lb. ferromanganese.\r\n    Analysis:\r\n      Carbon   Silicon  Sulphur  Phosphorus  Manganese\r\n       0.76     0.011    0.030     0.008       0.26\r\n\r\nTo form white slag there was added:\r\n\r\n  225 lb. lime.\r\n   75 lb. powdered coke.\r\n   55 lb. fluorspar.\r\n4:50 P.M.--\r\n  Analysis:\r\n      Carbon   Silicon  Sulphur  Phosphorus  Manganese\r\n       0.75     0.014    0.012     0.008       0.28\r\n           Note reduction of the sulphur content.\r\n\r\nDuring the white-slag period the following alloying additions were\r\nmade:\r\n\r\n  500 lb. pig iron.\r\n   80 lb. ferrosilicon.\r\n    9 lb. ferromanganese.\r\n  146 lb. 6 per cent carbon ferrochrome.\r\n\r\nThe furnace was rotated forward to an inclined position and the\r\ncharge poured into the ladle, from which in turn it was poured\r\ninto molds.\r\n\r\n5:40 P.M.--Heat poured.\r\n  Analysis:\r\n      Carbon   Silicon  Sulphur  Phosphorus  Manganese  Chromium\r\n       0.97     0.25     0.014     0.013       0.33       0.70\r\n\r\nIngot weight poured  94.0 per cent\r\nScull                 2.7 per cent\r\nLoss                  3.3 per cent\r\n\r\nTotal current consumption for the heat, 4,700 kW.-hr. or 710 kw.-hr.\r\nper ton.\r\n\r\nElectric steel, in fact, all fine steel, should be cast in big-end-up\r\nmolds with refractory hot tops to prevent any possibility of pipage\r\nin the body of the ingot. In the further processing of the ingot,\r\nwhether in the rolling mill or forge, special precautions should\r\nbe taken in the heating, in the reduction of the metal and in the\r\ncooling.\r\n\r\nNo attempt is made to compare the relative merits of open hearth\r\nand electric steel; results in service, day in and day out, have,\r\nhowever, thoroughly established the desirability of electric steel.\r\nTen years of experience indicate that electric steel is equal to\r\ncrucible steel and superior to open hearth.\r\n\r\nThe rare purity of the heat derived from the electric are, combined\r\nwith definite control of the slag in a neutral atmosphere, explains\r\nin part the superiority of electric steel. Commenting on this recently\r\nDr. H. M. Howe stated that \"in the open hearth process you have such\r\natmosphere and slag conditions as you can get, and in the electric\r\nyou have such atmosphere and slag conditions as you desire.\"\r\n\r\nAnother type of electric furnace is shown in Figs. 7 and 8. This\r\nis the Ludlum furnace, the illustrations showing a 10-ton size.\r\nFigure 7 shows it in normal, or melting position, while in Fig.\r\n8 it is tilted for pouring. In melting, the electrodes first rest\r\non the charge of material in the furnace. After the current is\r\nturned on they eat their way through, nearly to the bottom. By\r\nthis time there is a pool of molten metal beneath the electrode\r\nand the charge is melted from the bottom up so that the roof is\r\nnot exposed to the high temperature radiating from the open arc.\r\nThe electrodes in this furnace are of graphite, 9 in. in diameter\r\nand the current consumed is about 500 kw.-hr. per ton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Ludlum electric furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. S.--The furnace tilted for pouring.]\r\n\r\nOne of the things which sometimes confuse regarding the contents\r\nof steel is the fact that the percentage of carbon and the other\r\nalloys are usually designated in different ways. Carbon is usually\r\ndesignated by \"points\" and the other alloys by percentages. The\r\npoint is one ten-thousandth while 1 per cent is one one-hundredth\r\nof the whole. In other words, \"one hundred point carbon\" is steel\r\ncontaining 1 per cent carbon. Twenty point carbon, such as is used\r\nfor carbonizing purposes is 0.20 per cent. Tool steel varies from\r\none hundred to one hundred and fifty points carbon, or from 1.00\r\nto 1.50 per cent.\r\n\r\nNickel, chromium, etc., are always given in per cent, as a 3.5\r\nper cent nickel, which means exactly what it says--3-1/2 parts in\r\n100. Bearing this difference in mind all confusion will be avoided.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATIONS OF STEEL\r\n\r\nAmong makers and sellers, carbon tool-steels are classed by \"grade\"\r\nand \"temper.\" The word grade is qualified by many adjectives of\r\nmore or less cryptic meaning, but in general they aim to denote\r\nthe process and care with which the steel is made.\r\n\r\n_Temper_ of a steel refers to the carbon content. This should preferably\r\nbe noted by \"points,\" as just explained; but unfortunately, a 53-point\r\nsteel (containing 0.53 per cent carbon) may locally be called something\r\nlike \"No. 3 temper.\"\r\n\r\nA widely used method of classifying steels was originated by the\r\nSociety of Automotive Engineers. Each specification is represented\r\nby a number of 4 digits, the first figure indicating the class, the\r\nsecond figure the approximate percentage of predominant alloying\r\nelement, and the last two the average carbon content in points.\r\nPlain carbon steels are class 1, nickel steels are class 2,\r\nnickel-chromium steels are class 3, chromium steels are class 5,\r\nchromium-vanadium steels are class 6, and silico-manganese steels\r\nare class 9. Thus by this system, steel 2340 would be a 3 per cent\r\nnickel steel with 0.40 per cent carbon; or steel 1025 would be a\r\n0.25 plain carbon steel.\r\n\r\nSteel makers have no uniform classification for the various kinds\r\nof steel or steels used for different purposes.

If it was difficult\r\na hundred years ago to give a good definition of the term when the\r\nmetal was made by only one or two processes, it is doubly difficult\r\nnow, since the introduction of so many new operations and furnaces.\r\n\r\nWe are in better shape to know what steel is than our forefathers.\r\nThey went through certain operations and they got a soft malleable,\r\nweldable metal which would not harden; this they called iron. Certain\r\nother operations gave them something which looked very much like\r\niron, but which would harden after quenching from a red heat. This\r\nwas steel. Not knowing the essential difference between the two,\r\nthey must distinguish by the process of manufacture. To-day we\r\ncan make either variety by several methods, and can convert either\r\ninto the other at will, back and forth as often as we wish; so\r\nwe are able to distinguish between the two more logically.\r\n\r\nWe know that iron is a chemical element--the chemists write it\r\nFe for short, after the Latin word \"ferrum,\" meaning iron--it is\r\none of those substances which cannot be separated into anything\r\nelse but itself. It can be made to join with other elements; for\r\ninstance, it joins with the oxygen in the air and forms scale or\r\nrust, substances known to the chemist as iron oxide. But the same\r\nmetal iron can be recovered from that rust by abstracting the oxygen;\r\nhaving recovered the iron nothing else can be extracted but iron;\r\n_iron is elemental_.\r\n\r\nWe can get relatively pure iron from various minerals and artificial\r\nsubstances, and when we get it we always have a magnetic metal,\r\nalmost infusible, ductile, fairly strong, tough, something which\r\ncan be hardened slightly by hammering but which cannot be hardened\r\nby quenching. It has certain chemical properties, which need not be\r\ndescribed, which allow a skilled chemist to distinguish it without\r\ndifficulty and unerringly from the other known elements--nearly\r\n100 of them.\r\n\r\nCarbon is another chemical element, written C for short, which is\r\nwidely distributed through nature. Carbon also readily combines\r\nwith oxygen and other chemical elements, so that it is rarely found\r\npure; its most familiar form is soot, although the rarer graphite and\r\nmost rare diamond are also forms of quite pure carbon. It can also\r\nbe readily separated from its multitude of compounds (vegetation,\r\ncoal, limestone, petroleum) by the chemist.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of knowledge of scientific chemistry, it was quickly\r\nfound that the essential difference between iron and steel was that\r\nthe latter was _iron plus carbon_. Consequently it is an alloy,\r\nand the definition which modern metallurgists accept is this:\r\n\r\n\"Steel is an iron-carbon alloy containing less than about 2 per\r\ncent carbon.\"\r\n\r\nOf course there are other elements contained in commercial steel,\r\nand these elements are especially important in modern \"alloy steels,\"\r\nbut carbon is the element which changes a soft metal into one which\r\nmay be hardened, and strengthened by quenching. In fact, carbon,\r\nof itself, without heat treatment, strengthens iron at the expense\r\nof ductility (as noted by the percentage elongation an 8-in. bar\r\nwill stretch before breaking). This is shown by the following table:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                  |           |            |Elastic |Ultimate|Percentage.\r\n  Class by use.   | Class by  |  Per cent  | limit  |strength|elongation\r\n                  | hardness. |  carbon.   |lb. per |lb. per |in 8 inches.\r\n                  |           |            |sq. in. |sq. in. |\r\n------------------|-----------|------------|--------|--------|------------\r\nBoiler rivet steel|Dead soft  |0.08 to 0.15| 25,000 | 50,000 |     30\r\nStruc. rivet steel|Soft       |0.15 to 0.22| 30,000 | 55,000 |     30\r\nBoiler plate steel|Soft       |0.08 to 0.10| 30,000 | 60,000 |     25\r\nStructural steel  |Medium     |0.18 to 0.30| 35,000 | 65,000 |     25\r\nMachinery steel   |Hard       |0.35 to 0.60| 40,000 | 75,000 |     20\r\nRail steel        |Hard       |0.35 to 0.55| 40,000 | 75,000 |     15\r\nSpring steel      |High carbon|1.00 to 1.50| 60,000 |125,000 |     10\r\nTool steel        |High carbon|0.90 to 1.50| 80,000 |150,000 |      5\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nJust why a soft material like carbon (graphite), when added to\r\nanother soft material like iron, should make the iron harder, has\r\nbeen quite a mystery, and one which has caused a tremendous amount\r\nof study. The mutual interactions of these two elements in various\r\nproportions and at various temperatures will be discussed at greater\r\nlength later, especially in Chap. VIII, p. 105. But we may anticipate\r\nby saying that some of the iron unites with all the carbon to form a\r\nnew substance, very hard, a carbide which has been called \"cementite.\"\r\nThe compound always contains iron and carbon in the proportions\r\nof three atoms of iron to one atom of carbon; chemists note this\r\nfact in shorthand by the symbol Fe3C (a definite chemical compound\r\nof three atoms of iron to one of carbon). Many of the properties\r\nof steel, as they vary with carbon content, can be linked up with\r\nthe increasing amount of this hard carbide cementite, distributed\r\nin very fine particles through the softer iron.\r\n\r\nSULPHUR is another element (symbol S) which is always found in\r\nsteel in small quantities. Some sulphur is contained in the ore\r\nfrom which the iron is smelted; more sulphur is introduced by the\r\ncoke and fuel used. Sulphur is very difficult to get rid of in\r\nsteel making; in fact the resulting metal usually contains a little\r\nmore than the raw materials used. Only the electric furnace is\r\nable to produce the necessary heat and slags required to eliminate\r\nsulphur, and as a matter of fact the sulphur does not go until\r\nseveral other impurities have been eliminated. Consequently, an\r\nelectric steel with extremely low sulphur (0.02 per cent) is by\r\nthat same token a well-made metal.\r\n\r\nSulphur is of most trouble to rolling and forging operations when\r\nconducted at a red heat. It makes steel tender and brittle at that\r\ntemperature--a condition known to the workmen as \"red-short.\" It\r\nseems to have little or no effect upon the physical properties\r\nof cold steel--at least as revealed by the ordinary testing\r\nmachines--consequently many specifications do not set any limit\r\non sulphur, resting on the idea that if sulphur is low enough not\r\nto cause trouble to the manufacturer during rolling, it will not\r\ncause the user any trouble.\r\n\r\nTool steel and other fine steels should be very low in sulphur,\r\npreferably not higher than 0.03 per cent. Higher sulphur steels\r\n(0.06 per cent, and even up to 0.10 per cent) have given very good\r\nservice for machine parts, but in general a high sulphur steel\r\nis a suspicious steel. Screw stock is purposely made with up to\r\n0.12 per cent sulphur and a like amount of phosphorus so it will\r\ncut freely.\r\n\r\nManganese counteracts the detrimental effect of sulphur when present\r\nin the steel to an amount at least five times the sulphur content.\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORUS is an element (symbol P) which enters the metal from\r\nthe ore. It remains in the steel when made by the so-called acid\r\nprocess, but it can be easily eliminated down to 0.06 per cent\r\nin the basic process. In fact the discovery of the basic process\r\nwas necessary before the huge iron deposits of Belgium and the\r\nFranco-German border could be used. These ores contain several\r\nper cent phosphorus, and made a very brittle steel (\"cold short\")\r\nuntil basic furnaces were used. Basic furnaces allow the formation\r\nof a slag high in lime, which takes practically all the phosphorus\r\nout of the metal. Not only is the resulting metal usable, but the\r\nslag makes a very excellent fertilizer, and is in good demand.\r\n\r\nSILICON is a very widespread element (symbol Si), being an essential\r\nconstituent of nearly all the rocks of the earth. It is similar to\r\ncarbon in many of its chemical properties; for instance it burns\r\nvery readily in oxygen, and consequently native silicon is unknown--it\r\nis always found in combination with one or more other elements.\r\nWhen it bums, each atom of silicon unites with two atoms of oxygen\r\nto form a compound known to chemists as silica (SiO2), and to the\r\nsmall boy as \"sand\" and \"agate.\"\r\n\r\nIron ore (an oxide of iron) contains more or less sand and dirt\r\nmixed in it when it is mined, and not only the iron oxide but also\r\nsome of the silicon oxide is robbed of its oxygen by the smelting\r\nprocess. Pig iron--the product of the blast furnace--therefore\r\ncontains from 1 to 3 per cent of silicon, and some silicon remains\r\nin the metal after it has been purified and converted into steel.\r\n\r\nHowever, silicon, as noted above, burns very readily in oxygen,\r\nand this property is of good use in steel making. At the end of\r\nthe steel-making process the metal contains more or less oxygen,\r\nwhich must be removed. This is sometimes done (especially in the\r\nso-called acid process) by adding a small amount of silicon to\r\nthe hot metal just before it leaves the furnace, and stirring it\r\nin. It thereupon abstracts oxygen from the metal wherever it finds\r\nit, changing to silica (SiO2) which rises and floats on the surface\r\nof the cleaned metal. Most of the silicon remaining in the metal\r\nis an excess over that which is required to remove the dangerous\r\noxygen, and the final analysis of many steels show enough silicon\r\n(from 0.20 to 0.40) to make sure that this step in the manufacture\r\nhas been properly done.\r\n\r\nMANGANESE is a metal much like iron. Its chemical symbol is Mn. It\r\nis somewhat more active than iron in many chemical changes--notably\r\nit has what is apparently a stronger attraction for oxygen and\r\nsulphur than has iron. Therefore the metal is used (especially in\r\nthe so-called basic process) to free the molten steel of oxygen,\r\nacting in a manner similar to silicon, as explained above. The\r\ncompound of manganese and oxygen is readily eliminated from the\r\nmetal. Sufficient excess of elemental manganese should remain so\r\nthat the purchaser may be sure that the iron has been properly\r\n\"deoxidized,\" and to render harmless the traces of sulphur present.\r\nNo damage is done by the presence of a little manganese in steel,\r\nquite the reverse. Consequently it is common to find steels containing\r\nfrom 0.3 to 1.5 per cent.\r\n\r\nALLOYING ELEMENTS.--Commercial steels of even the simplest types\r\nare therefore primarily alloys of iron and carbon. Impurities and\r\ntheir \"remedies\" are always present: sulphur, phosphorus, silicon\r\nand manganese--to say nothing of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon oxide\r\ngases, about which we know very little. It has been found that other\r\nmetals, if added to well-made steel, produce definite improvements\r\nin certain directions, and these \"alloy steels\" have found much\r\nuse in the last ten years. Alloy steels, in addition to the\r\nabove-mentioned elements, may commonly contain one or more of the\r\nfollowing, in varying amounts: Nickel (Ni), Chromium (Cr), Vanadium\r\n(Va), Tungsten (W), Molybdenum (Mo). These steels will be discussed\r\nat more length in Chapters III and IV.\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES OF STEEL\r\n\r\nSteels are known by certain tests. Early tests were more or less\r\ncrude, and depended upon the ability of the workman to judge the\r\n\"grain\" exhibited by a freshly broken piece of steel. The cold-bend\r\ntest was also very useful--a small bar was bent flat upon itself,\r\nand the stretched fibers examined for any sign of break. Harder\r\nstiff steels were supported at the ends and the amount of central\r\nload they would support before fracture, or the amount of permanent\r\nset they would acquire at a given load noted. Files were also used\r\nto test the hardness of very hard steel.\r\n\r\nThese tests are still used to a considerable extent, especially in\r\nworks where the progress of an operation can be kept under close\r\nwatch in this way, the product being periodically examined by more\r\nprecise methods. The chief furnace-man, or \"melter,\" in a steel\r\nplant, judges the course of the refining process by casting small\r\ntest ingots from time to time, breaking them and examining the\r\nfracture. Cutlery manufacturers use the bend test to judge the\r\ntemper of blades. File testing of case-hardened parts is very common.\r\n\r\nHowever there is need of standardized methods which depend less\r\nupon the individual skill of the operator, and which will yield\r\nresults comparable to others made by different men at different\r\nplaces and on different steels. Hence has grown up the art of testing\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nTENSILE PROPERTIES\r\n\r\nStrength of a metal is usually expressed in the number of pounds\r\na 1-in. bar will support just before breaking, a term called the\r\n\"ultimate strength.\" It has been found that the shape of the test\r\nbar and its method of loading has some effect upon the results,\r\nso it is now usual to turn a rod 5-1/2 in. long down to 0.505 in.\r\nin diameter for a central length of 2-3/8 in., ending the turn\r\nwith 1/2-in. fillets. The area of the bar equals 0.2 sq. in., so\r\nthe load it bears at rupture multiplied by 5 will represent the\r\n\"ultimate strength\" in pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nSuch a test bar is stretched apart in a machine like that shown\r\nin Fig. 9. The upper end of the bar is held in wedged jaws by the\r\ntop cross-head, and the lower end grasped by the movable head.\r\nThe latter is moved up and down by three long screws, driven at\r\nthe same speed, which pass through threads cut in the corners of\r\nthe cross-head. When the test piece is fixed in position the motor\r\nwhich drives the machine is given a few turns, which by proper\r\ngearing pulls the cross-head down with a certain pull. This pull\r\nis transmitted to the upper cross-head by the test bar, and can\r\nbe weighed on the scale arm, acting through a system of links and\r\nlevers.\r\n\r\nThus the load may be increased as rapidly as desirable, always\r\nkept balanced by the weighing mechanism, and the load at fracture\r\nmay be read directly from the scale beam.\r\n\r\nThis same test piece may give other information. If light punch\r\nmarks are made, 2 in. apart, before the test is begun, the broken\r\nends may be clamped together, and the distance between punch marks\r\nmeasured. If it now measures 3 in. the stretch has been 1 in. in 2,\r\nor 50 per cent. This figure is known as the elongation at fracture,\r\nor briefly, the \"elongation,\" and is generally taken to be a measure\r\nof ductility.\r\n\r\nWhen steel shows any elongation, it also contracts in area at the\r\nsame time. Often this contraction is sharply localized at the fracture;\r\nthe piece is said to \"neck.\" A figure for contraction in area is\r\nalso of much interest as an indication of toughness; the diameter\r\nat fracture is measured, a corresponding area taken out from a\r\ntable of circles, subtracted from the original area (0.200 sq.\r\nin.) and the difference divided by 0.2 to get the percentage\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Olsen testing machine.]\r\n\r\nQuite often it is desired to discover the elastic limit of the\r\nsteel, in fact this is of more use to the designer than the ultimate\r\nstrength. The elastic limit is usually very close to the load where\r\nthe metal takes on a permanent set. That is to say, if a delicate\r\ncaliper (\"extensometer,\" so called) be fixed to the side of the\r\ntest specimen, it would show the piece to be somewhat longer under\r\nload than when free. Furthermore, if the load had not yet reached the\r\nyield point, and were released at any time, the piece would return\r\nto its original length. However, if the load had been excessive, and\r\nthen relieved, the extensometer would no longer read exactly 2.0\r\nin., but something more.\r\n\r\nSoft steels \"give\" very quickly at the yield point. In fact, if\r\nthe testing machine is running slowly, it takes some time for the\r\nlower head to catch up with the stretching steel. Consequently at\r\nthe yield point, the top head is suddenly but only temporarily\r\nrelieved of load, and the scale beam drops. In commercial practice,\r\nthe yield point is therefore determined by the \"drop of the beam.\"\r\nFor more precise work the calipers are read at intervals of 500 or\r\n1,000 lb. load, and a curve plotted from these results, a curve\r\nwhich runs straight up to the elastic limit, but there bends off.\r\n\r\nA tensile test therefore gives four properties of great usefulness:\r\nThe yield point, the ultimate strength, the elongation and the\r\ncontraction. Compression tests are seldom made, since the action\r\nof metal in compression and in tension is closely allied, and the\r\ndesigner is usually satisfied with the latter.\r\n\r\nIMPACT TESTS\r\n\r\nImpact tests are of considerable importance as an indication of\r\nhow a metal will perform under shock. Some engineers think that\r\nthe tensile test, which is one made under slow loading, should\r\ntherefore be supplemented by another showing what will happen if\r\nthe load is applied almost instantaneously. This test, however, has\r\nnot been standardized, and depends to a considerable extent upon\r\nthe type of machine, but more especially the size of the specimen\r\nand the way it is \"nicked.\" The machine is generally a swinging\r\nheavy pendulum. It falls a certain height, strikes the sample at\r\nthe lowest point, and swings on past. The difference between the\r\ndownward and upward swing is a measure of the energy it took to\r\nbreak the test piece.\r\n\r\nFATIGUE TESTS\r\n\r\nIt has been known for fifty years that a beam or rod would fail\r\nat a relatively low stress if only repeated often enough. It has\r\nbeen found, however, that each material possesses a limiting stress,\r\nor endurance limit, within which it is safe, no matter how often\r\nthe loading occurs. That limiting stress for all steels so far\r\ninvestigated causes fracture below 10 million reversals. In other\r\nwords, a steel which will not break before 10,000,000 reversals\r\ncan confidently be expected to endure 100,000,000, and doubtless\r\ninto the billions.\r\n\r\nAbout the only way to test one piece such a large number of times\r\nis to fashion it into a beam, load it, and then turn the beam in\r\nits supports. Thus the stress in the outer fibers of the bar varies\r\nfrom a maximum stretch through zero to a maximum compression, and\r\nback again. A simple machine of this sort is shown in Fig. 10,\r\nwhere _B_ and _E_ are bearings, _A_ the test piece, turned slightly\r\ndown in the center, _C_ and _D_ ball bearings supporting a load\r\n_W_. _K_ is a pulley for driving the machine and _N_ is a counter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Sketch of rotating beam machine for measuring\r\nendurance of metal.]\r\n\r\nHARDNESS TESTING\r\n\r\nThe word \"hardness\" is used to express various properties of metals,\r\nand is measured in as many different ways.\r\n\r\n\"Scratch hardness\" is used by the geologist, who has constructed\r\n\"Moh's scale\" as follows:\r\n\r\n  Talc      has a hardness of  1\r\n  Rock Salt has a hardness of  2\r\n  Calcite   has a hardness of  3\r\n  Fluorite  has a hardness of  4\r\n  Apatite   has a hardness of  5\r\n  Feldspar  has a hardness of  6\r\n  Quartz    has a hardness of  7\r\n  Topaz     has a hardness of  8\r\n  Corundum  has a hardness of  9\r\n  Diamond   has a hardness of 10\r\n\r\nA mineral will scratch all those above it in the series, and will\r\nbe scratched by those below. A weighted diamond cone drawn slowly\r\nover a surface will leave a path the width of which (measured by\r\na microscope) varies inversely as the scratch hardness.\r\n\r\n\"Cutting hardness\" is measured by a standardized drilling machine,\r\nand has a limited application in machine-shop practice.\r\n\r\n\"Rebounding hardness\" is commonly measured by the Shore scleroscope,\r\nillustrated in Fig. 11. A small steel hammer, 1/4 in. in diameter,\r\n3/4 in. in length, and weighing about 1/12 oz. is dropped a distance\r\nof 10 in. upon the test piece. The height of rebound in arbitrary\r\nunits represents the hardness numeral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Shore scleroscope.]\r\n\r\nShould the hammer have a hard flat surface and drop on steel so hard\r\nthat no impression were made, it would rebound about 90 per cent\r\nof the fall. The point, however, consists of a slightly spherical,\r\nblunt diamond nose 0.02 in. in diameter, which will indent the steel\r\nto a certain extent. The work required to make the indentation\r\nis taken from the energy of the falling body; the rebound will\r\nabsorb the balance, and the hammer will now rise from the same\r\nsteel a distance equal to about 75 per cent of the fall. A permanent\r\nimpression is left upon the test piece because the impact will\r\ndevelop a force of several hundred thousand pounds per square inch\r\nunder the tiny diamond-pointed hammer head, stressing the test\r\npiece at this point of contact much beyond its ultimate strength.\r\nThe rebound is thus dependent upon the indentation hardness, for\r\nthe reason that the less the indentation, the more energy will\r\nreappear in the rebound; also, the less the indentation, the harder\r\nthe material. Consequently, the harder the material, the more the\r\nrebound.\r\n\r\n\"Indentation hardness\" is a measure of a material's resistance\r\nto penetration and deformation. The standard testing machine is\r\nthe Brinell, Fig. 12. A hardened steel ball, 10 mm. in diameter,\r\nis forced into the test piece with a pressure of 3,000 kg. (3-1/3\r\ntons). The resulting indentation is then measured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Hydraulic testing machine. (Brinell\r\nprinciple.)]\r\n\r\nWhile under load, the steel ball in a Brinell machine naturally\r\nflattens somewhat. The indentation left behind in the test piece is\r\na duplicate of the surface which made it, and is usually regarded\r\nas being the segment of a sphere of somewhat larger radius than\r\nthe ball. The radius of curvature of this spherical indentation\r\nwill vary slightly with the load and the depth of indentation.\r\nThe Brinell hardness numeral is the quotient found by dividing the\r\ntest pressure in kilograms by the spherical area of the indentation.\r\nThe denominator, as before, will vary according to the size of the\r\nsphere, the hardness of the sphere and the load. These items have\r\nbeen standardized, and the following table has been constructed\r\nso that if the diameter of the identation produced by a load of\r\n3,000 kg. be measured the hardness numeral is found directly.\r\n\r\n                      TABLE FOR BRINELL BALL TEST\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDiameter of Ball | Hardness Number | Diameter of Ball | Hardness Number\r\nImpression, mm.  |  for a Load of  | Impression, mm.  |  for a Load of\r\n                 |    3,000 kg.    |                  |    3,000 kg.\r\n-----------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------\r\n      2.0        |       946       |       4.5        |       179\r\n      2.1        |       857       |       4.6        |       170\r\n      2.2        |       782       |       4 7        |       163\r\n      2.3        |       713       |       4.8        |       156\r\n      2.4        |       652       |       4.9        |       149\r\n      2.5        |       600       |       5.0        |       143\r\n                 |                 |                  |\r\n      2.6        |       555       |       5.1        |       137\r\n      2.7        |       512       |       5.2        |       131\r\n      2.8        |       477       |       5.3        |       126\r\n      2.9        |       444       |       5.4        |       121\r\n      3.0        |       418       |       5.5        |       116\r\n                 |                 |                  |\r\n      3.1        |       387       |       5.6        |       112\r\n      3.2        |       364       |       5.7        |       107\r\n      3.3        |       340       |       5.8        |       103\r\n      3.4        |       321       |       5.9        |        99\r\n      3.5        |       302       |       6.0        |        95\r\n                 |                 |                  |\r\n      3.6        |       286       |       6.1        |        92\r\n      3.7        |       269       |       6.2        |        89\r\n      3.8        |       255       |       6.3        |        86\r\n      3.9        |       241       |       6.4        |        83\r\n      4.0        |       228       |       6.5        |        80\r\n                 |                 |                  |\r\n      4.1        |       217       |       6.6        |        77\r\n      4.2        |       207       |       6.7        |        74\r\n      4.3        |       196       |       6.8        |        71.5\r\n      4.4        |       187       |       6.9        |        69\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nALLOYS AND THEIR EFFECT UPON STEEL\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that alloy steels are coming into a great deal\r\nof prominence, it would be well for the users of these steels to\r\nfully appreciate the effects of the alloys upon the various grades\r\nof steel. We have endeavored to summarize the effect of these alloys\r\nso that the users can appreciate their effect, without having to\r\nstudy a metallurgical treatise and then, perhaps, not get the crux\r\nof the matter.\r\n\r\nNICKEL\r\n\r\nNickel may be considered as the toughest among the non-rare alloys\r\nnow used in steel manufacture. Originally nickel was added to give\r\nincreased strength and toughness over that obtained with the ordinary\r\nrolled structural steel and little attempt was made to utilize its\r\ngreat possibilities so far as heat treatment was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties experienced have been a tendency towards laminated\r\nstructure during manufacture and great liability to seam, both\r\narising from improper melting practice. When extra care is exercised\r\nin the manufacture, particularly in the melting and rolling, many\r\nof these difficulties can be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe electric steel furnace, of modern construction, is a very important\r\nstep forward in the melting of nickel steel; neither the crucible\r\nprocess nor basic or acid open-hearth furnaces give such good results.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be exercised in reheating the billet for rolling\r\nso that the steel is correctly soaked. The rolling must not be\r\nforced; too big reduction per pass should not be indulged in, as\r\nthis sets up a tendency towards seams.\r\n\r\nNickel steel has remarkably good mechanical qualities when suitably\r\nheat-treated, and it is preeminently adapted for case-hardening. It\r\nis not difficult to machine low-nickel steel, consequently it is\r\nin great favor where easy machining properties are of importance.\r\n\r\nNickel influences the strength and ductility of steel by being\r\ndissolved directly in the iron or ferrite; in this respect differing\r\nfrom chromium, tungsten and vanadium. The addition of each 1 per\r\ncent nickel up to 5 per cent will cause an approximate increase of\r\nfrom 4,000 to 6,000 lb. per square inch in the tensile strength and\r\nelastic limit over the corresponding steel and without any decrease\r\nin ductility. The static strength of nickel steel is affected to\r\nsome degree by the percentage of carbon; for instance, steel with\r\n0.25 per cent carbon and 3.5 per cent nickel has a tensile strength,\r\nin its normal state, equal to a straight carbon steel of 0.5 per\r\ncent with a proportionately greater elastic limit and retaining\r\nall the advantages of the ductility of the lower carbon.\r\n\r\nTo bring out the full qualities of nickel it must be heat-treated,\r\notherwise there is no object in using nickel as an alloy with carbon\r\nsteel as the additional cost is not justified by increased strength.\r\n\r\nNickel has a peculiar effect upon the critical ranges of steel,\r\nthe critical range being lowered by the percentage of nickel; in\r\nthis respect it is similar to manganese.\r\n\r\nNickel can be alloyed with steel in various percentages, each percentage\r\nhaving a very definite effect on the microstructure. For instance, a\r\nsteel with 0.2 per cent carbon and 2 per cent nickel has a pearlitic\r\nstructure but the grain is much finer than if the straight carbon\r\nwere used. With the same carbon content and say 5 per cent nickel,\r\nthe structure would still be pearlitic, but much finer and denser,\r\ntherefore capable of withstanding shock, and having greater dynamic\r\nstrength. With about 0.2 per cent carbon and 8 per cent nickel, the\r\nsteel is nearing the stage between pearlite and martensite, and\r\nthe structure is extremely fine, the ferrite and pearlite having\r\na very pronounced tendency to mimic a purely martensite structure.\r\nSteel with 0.2 per cent carbon and 15 per cent nickel is entirely\r\nmartensite. Higher percentages of nickel change the martensitic\r\nstructure to austenite, the steel then being non-magnetic. The\r\nhigher percentages, that is 30 to 35 per cent nickel, are used\r\nfor valve seats, valve heads, and valve stems, as the alloy is a\r\npoor conductor of heat and is particularly free from any tendency\r\ntowards corrosion or pitting from the action of waste gases of\r\nthe internal-combustion engine.\r\n\r\nNickel steels having 3-1/2 per cent nickel and 0.15 to 0.20 per\r\ncent carbon are excellent for case-hardening purposes, giving hard\r\nsurfaces and tough interiors.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the full effect of nickel as an alloy, it is essential\r\nthat the correct percentage of carbon be used. High nickel and\r\nlow carbon will not be more efficient than lower nickel and higher\r\ncarbon, but the cost will be much greater. Generally speaking,\r\nheat-treated nickel alloy steels are about two to three times stronger\r\nthan the same steel annealed. This point is very important as many\r\ninstances have been found where nickel steel is incorrectly used,\r\nbeing employed when in the annealed or normal state.\r\n\r\nCHROMIUM\r\n\r\nChromium when alloyed with steel, has the characteristic function\r\nof opposing the disintegration and reconstruction of cementite.\r\nThis is demonstrated by the changes in the critical ranges of this\r\nalloy steel taking place slowly; in other words, it has a tendency\r\nto raise the _Ac_ range (decalescent points) and lower the _Ar_\r\nrange (recalescent points). Chromium steels are therefore capable\r\nof great hardness, due to the rapid cooling being able to retard\r\nthe decomposition of the austenite.\r\n\r\nThe great hardness of chromium steels is also due to the formation\r\nof double carbides of chromium and iron. This condition is not\r\nremoved when the steel is slightly tempered or drawn. This additional\r\nhardness is also obtained without causing undue brittleness such as\r\nwould be obtained by any increase of carbon. The degree of hardness\r\nof the lower-chrome steels is dependent upon the carbon content,\r\nas chromium alone will not harden iron.\r\n\r\nThe toughness so noticeable in this steel is the result of the\r\nfineness of structure; in this instance, the action is similar\r\nto that of nickel, and the tensile strength and elastic limit is\r\ntherefore increased without any loss of ductility. We then have\r\nthe desirable condition of tough hardness, making chrome steels\r\nextremely valuable for all purposes requiring great resistance\r\nto wear, and in higher-chrome contents resistance to corrosion.\r\nAll chromium-alloy steels offer great resistance to corrosion and\r\nerosion. In view of this, it is surprising that chromium steels\r\nare not more largely used for structural steel work and for all\r\npurposes where the steel has to withstand the corroding action\r\nof air and liquids. Bridges, ships, steel building, etc., would\r\noffer greater resistance to deterioration through rust if the\r\nchromium-alloy steels were employed.\r\n\r\nProlonged heating and high temperatures have a very bad effect upon\r\nchromium steels. In this respect they differ from nickel steels,\r\nwhich are not so affected by prolonged heating, but chromium steels\r\nwill stand higher temperatures than nickel steels when the period\r\nis short.\r\n\r\nChromium steels, due to their admirable property of increased hardness,\r\nwithout the loss of ductility, make very excellent chisels and\r\nimpact tools of all types, although for die blocks they do not give\r\nsuch good results as can be obtained from other alloy combinations.\r\n\r\nFor ball bearing steels, where intense hardness with great toughness\r\nand ready recovery from temporary deflection is required, chromium\r\nas an alloy offers the best solution.\r\n\r\nTwo per cent chromium steels; due to their very hard tough surface,\r\nare largely used for armor-piercing projectiles, cold rolls, crushers,\r\ndrawing dies, etc.\r\n\r\nThe normal structure of chromium steels, with a very low carbon\r\ncontent is roughly pearlitic up to 7 per cent, and martensitic\r\nfrom 8 to 20 per cent; therefore, the greatest application is in\r\nthe pearlitic zone or the lower percentages.\r\n\r\nNICKEL-CHROMIUM\r\n\r\nA combination of the characteristics of nickel and the characteristics\r\nof chromium, as described, should obviously give a very excellent\r\nsteel as the nickel particularly affects the ferrite of the steel\r\nand the chromium the carbon. From this combination, we are able to\r\nget a very strong ferrite matrix and a very hard tough cementite.\r\nThe strength of a strictly pearlitic steel over a pure iron is due\r\nto the pearlitic being a layer arrangement of cementite running\r\nparallel to that of a pure iron layer in each individual grain. The\r\nferrite _i.e._, the iron is increased in strength by the resistance\r\noffered by the cementite which is the simple iron-carbon combination\r\nknown to metallurgists as Fe3C. The cementite, although adding\r\nto the tensile strength, is very brittle and the strength of the\r\npearlite is the combination of the ferrite and cementite. In the\r\nevent of the cementite being strengthened, as in the case of strictly\r\nchromium steels, an increased tensile strength is readily obtained\r\nwithout loss of ductility and if the ferrite is strengthened then\r\nthe tensile strength and ductility of the metal is still further\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nNickel-chromium alloy represents one of the best combinations available\r\nat the present time. The nickel intensifies the physical characteristics\r\nof the chromium and the chromium has a similar effect on the nickel.\r\n\r\nFor case-hardening, nickel-chromium steels seem to give very excellent\r\nresults. The carbon is very rapidly taken up in this combination,\r\nand for that reason is rather preferable to the straight nickel steel.\r\n\r\nWith the mutually intensifying action of chromium and nickel there\r\nis a most suitable ratio for these two alloys, and it has been found\r\nthat roughly 2-1/2 parts of nickel to about 1 part of chromium\r\ngives the best results. Therefore, we have the standard types of\r\n3.5 per cent nickel with 1.5 per cent chromium to 1.5 per cent\r\nnickel with 0.6 per cent chromium and the various intermediate\r\ntypes. This ratio, however, does not give the whole story of\r\nnickel-chromium combinations, and many surprising results have\r\nbeen obtained with these alloys when other percentage combinations\r\nhave been employed.\r\n\r\nVANADIUM\r\n\r\nVanadium has a very marked effect upon alloy steels rich in chromium,\r\ncarbon, or manganese. Vanadium itself, when combined with steel very\r\nlow in carbon, is not so noticeably beneficial as in the same carbon\r\nsteel higher in manganese, but if a small quantity of chromium\r\nis added, then the vanadium has a very marked effect in increasing\r\nthe impact strength of the alloy. It would seem that vanadium has\r\nthe effect of intensifying the action of chromium and manganese, or\r\nthat vanadium is intensified by the action of chromium or manganese.\r\n\r\nVanadium has the peculiar property of readily entering into solution\r\nwith ferrite. If vanadium contained is considerable it also combines\r\nwith the carbon, forming carbides. The ductility of carbon-vanadium\r\nsteels is therefore increased, likewise the ductility of chrome-vanadium\r\nsteels.\r\n\r\nThe full effect of vanadium is not felt unless the temperatures to\r\nwhich the steel is heated for hardening are raised considerably.\r\nIt is therefore necessary that a certain amount of \"soaking\" takes\r\nplace, so as to get the necessary equalization. This is true of all\r\nalloys which contain complex carbides, i.e., compounds of carbon,\r\niron and one or more elements.\r\n\r\nChrome-vanadium steels also are highly favored for case hardening.\r\nWhen used under alternating stresses it appears to have superior\r\nendurance. It would appear that the intensification of the properties\r\ndue to chromium and manganese in the alloy steel accounts for this\r\npeculiar phenomenon.\r\n\r\nVanadium is also a very excellent scavenger for either removing\r\nthe harmful gases, or causing them to enter into solution with the\r\nmetal in such a way as to largely obviate their harmful effects.\r\nChrome-vanadium steels have been claimed, by many steel manufacturers\r\nand users, to be preferable to nickel-chrome steels. While not\r\nwishing to pass judgment on this, it should be borne in mind that\r\nthe chrome-vanadium steel, which is tested, is generally compared\r\nwith a very low nickel-chromium alloy steel (the price factor entering\r\ninto the situation), but equally good results can be obtained by\r\nnickel-chromium steels of suitable analysis.\r\n\r\nWhere price is the leading factor, there are many cases where a\r\nstronger steel can be obtained from the chrome and vanadium than\r\nthe nickel-chrome. It will be safe to say that each of these two\r\nsystems of alloys have their own particular fields and chrome-vanadium\r\nsteel should not be regarded as the sole solution for all problems,\r\nneither should nickel-chromium.\r\n\r\nMANGANESE\r\n\r\nManganese adds considerably to the tensile strength of steel, but\r\nthis is dependent on the carbon content. High carbon materially adds\r\nto the brittleness, whereas low-carbon, pearlitic-manganese steels\r\nare very tough and ductile and are not at all brittle, providing the\r\nheat-treating is correct. Manganese steel is very susceptible to\r\nhigh temperatures and prolonged heating.\r\n\r\nIn low-carbon pearlitic steels, manganese is more effective in\r\nincreasing ultimate strength than is nickel; that is to say, a\r\n0.45 carbon steel with 1.25 per cent manganese is as strong as a\r\n0.45 carbon steel with 1.5 per cent nickel. The former steel is\r\nmuch used for rifle barrels, and in the heat-treated condition will\r\ngive 80,000 to 90,000 lb. per square inch elastic limit, 115,000 to\r\n125,000 lb. per square inch tensile strength, 23 per cent elongation,\r\nand 55 per cent reduction in area.\r\n\r\nManganese when added to steel has the effect of lowering the critical\r\nrange; 1 per cent manganese will lower the upper critical point\r\n60°F. The action of manganese is very similar to that of nickel\r\nin this respect, only twice as powerful. As an instance, 1 per\r\ncent nickel would have the effect of lowering the upper critical\r\nrange from 25 to 30°F.\r\n\r\nLow-carbon pearlitic-manganese steel, heat-treated, will give dynamic\r\nstrength which cannot be equaled by low-priced and necessarily\r\nlow-content nickel steels. In many instances, it is preferable to use\r\nhigh-grade manganese steel, rather than low-content nickel steel.\r\n\r\nHigh-manganese steels or austenite manganese steels are used for a\r\nvariety of purposes where great resistance to abrasion is required,\r\nthe percentage of manganese being from 11 to 14 per cent, and carbon\r\n1 to 1.5 per cent. This steel is practically valueless unless\r\nheat-treated; that is, heated to about yellow red and quenched\r\nin ice water. The structure is then austenite and the air-cooled\r\nstructure of this steel is martensite. Therefore this steel has to\r\nbe heated and very rapidly cooled to obtain the ductile austenite\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nManganese between 2 and 7 per cent is a very brittle material when\r\nthe carbon is about 1 per cent or higher and is, therefore, quite\r\nvalueless. Below 2 per cent manganese steel low in carbon is very\r\nductile and tough steel.\r\n\r\nThe high-content manganese steels are known as the \"Hadfield manganese\r\nsteels,\" having been developed by Sir Robert Hadfield. Small additions\r\nof chrome up to 1 per cent increase the elastic limit of low-carbon\r\npearlitic-manganese steels without affecting the steel in its resistance\r\nto shock, but materially decrease the percentage of elongation.\r\n\r\nVanadium added to low-carbon pearlitic manganese steel has a very\r\nmarked effect, increasing greatly the dynamic strength and changing\r\nslightly the susceptibility of this steel to heat treatments, giving\r\na greater margin for the hardening temperature. Manganese steel\r\nwith added vanadium is most efficient when heat-treated.\r\n\r\nTUNGSTEN\r\n\r\nTungsten, as an alloy in steel, has been known and used for a long\r\ntime. The celebrated and ancient damascus steel being a form of\r\ntungsten-alloy steel. Tungsten and its effects, however, did not\r\nbecome generally realized until Robert Mushet experimented and\r\ndeveloped his famous mushet steel and the many improvement made\r\nsince that date go to prove how little Mushet himself understood\r\nthe peculiar effects of tungsten as an alloy.\r\n\r\nTungsten acts on steel in a similar manner to carbon, that is,\r\nit increases its hardness, but is much less effective than carbon\r\nin this respect. If the percentage of tungsten and manganese is\r\nhigh, the steel will be hard after cooling in the air. This is\r\nimpossible in a carbon steel. It was this combination that Mushet\r\nused in his well-known \"air-hardening\" steel.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of tungsten is in high-speed tool steel, but\r\nhere a high percentage of manganese is distinctly detrimental,\r\nmaking the steel liable to fire crack, very brittle and weak in\r\nthe body, less easily forged and annealed. Manganese should be\r\nkept low and a high percentage of chromium used instead.\r\n\r\nTools of tungsten-chromium steels, when hardened, retain their\r\nhardness, even when heated to a dark cherry red by the friction of\r\nthe cutting or the heat arising from the chips. This characteristic\r\nled to the term \"red-hardness,\" and it is this property that has\r\nmade possible the use of very high cutting speeds in tools made\r\nof the tungsten-chromium alloy, that is, \"high-speed\" steel.\r\n\r\nTungsten steels containing up to 6 per cent do not have the property\r\nof red hardness any more than does carbon tool steel, providing\r\nthe manganese or chromium is low.\r\n\r\nWhen chromium is alloyed with tungsten, a very definite red-hardness\r\nis noticed with a great increase of cutting efficiency. The maximum\r\nred-hardness seems to be had with steels containing 18 per cent\r\ntungsten, 5.5 per cent chromium and 0.70 per cent carbon.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the actual function of tungsten, although\r\na vast amount of experimental work has been done. It is possible\r\nthat when the effect of tungsten with iron-carbon alloys is better\r\nknown, a greater improvement can be expected from these steels.\r\nTungsten has been tried and is still used by some steel manufacturers\r\nfor making punches, chisels, and other impact tools. It has also\r\nbeen used for springs, and has given very good results, although\r\nother less expensive alloys give equally good results, and are\r\nin some instances, better.\r\n\r\nTungsten is largely used in permanent magnets. In this, its action\r\nis not well understood. In fact, the reason why steel becomes a\r\npermanent magnet is not at all understood. Theories have been evolved,\r\nbut all are open to serious questioning. The principal effect of\r\ntungsten, as conceded by leading authorities, is that it distinctly\r\nretards separation of the iron-carbon solution, removing the lowest\r\nrecalescent point down to atmospheric temperature.\r\n\r\nA peculiar property of tungsten steels is that if a heating temperature\r\nof 1,750°F. is not exceeded, the cooling curves indicate but one\r\ncritical point at about 1,350°F. But when the heating temperature\r\nis raised above 1,850°F., this critical point is nearly if not\r\nquite suppressed, while a lower critical point appears and grows\r\nenormously in intensity at a temperature between 660 and 750°F.\r\n\r\nThe change in the critical ranges, which is produced by heating\r\ntungsten steels to over 1,850°F., is the real cause of the red-hard\r\nproperties of these alloys. Its real nature is not understood,\r\nand there is no direct evidence to show what actually happens at\r\nthese high temperatures.\r\n\r\nIt may readily be understood that an alloy containing four essential\r\nelements, namely: iron, carbon, tungsten and chromium, is one whose\r\nstudy presents problems of extreme complexity. It is possible that\r\ncomplex carbides may be formed, as in chromium steels, and that\r\ncompounds between iron and tungsten exist. Behavior of these\r\ncombinations on heating and cooling must be better known before\r\nwe are able to explain many peculiarities of tungsten steels.\r\n\r\nMOLYBDENUM\r\n\r\nMolybdenum steels have been made commercially for twenty-five years,\r\nbut they have not been widely exploited until since the war. Very\r\nlarge resources of molybdenum have been developed in America, and\r\nthe mining companies who are equipped to produce the metal are\r\nvery active in advertising the advantages of molybdenum steels.\r\n\r\nIt was early found that 1 part molybdenum was the equivalent of from\r\n2 to 2-1/2 parts of tungsten in tool steels, and magnet steels. It\r\nfell into disrepute as an alloy for high-speed tool steel, however,\r\nbecause it was found that the molybdenum was driven out of the\r\nsurface of the tool during forging and heat treating.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years it has been found that the presence of\r\nless than 1 per cent of molybdenum greatly enhances certain properties\r\nof heat-treated carbon and alloy steels used for automobiles and\r\nhigh-grade machinery.\r\n\r\nIn general, molybdenum when added to an alloy steel, increases the\r\nfigure for reduction of area, which is considered a good measure\r\nof \"toughness.\" Molybdenum steels are also relatively insensible\r\nto variations in heat treatment; that is to say, a\r\nchromium-nickel-molybdenum steel after quenching in oil from 1,450°F.\r\nmay be drawn at any temperature between 900 and 1,100°F. with\r\nsubstantially the same result (static tensile properties and hardness).\r\n\r\nSILICON\r\n\r\nSilicon prevents, to a large extent, defects such as gas bubbles\r\nor blow holes forming while steel is solidifying. In fact, steel\r\nafter it has been melted and before it has been refined, is \"wild\"\r\nand \"gassy.\" That is to say, if it would be cast into molds it\r\nwould froth up, and boil all over the floor. A judicious amount\r\nof silicon added to the metal just before pouring, prevents this\r\naction--in the words of the steel maker, silicon \"kills\" the steel.\r\nIf about 1.75 per cent metallic silicon remains in a 0.65 carbon\r\nsteel, it makes excellent springs.\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORUS\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is one of the impurities in steel, and it has been the\r\nobject of steel makers for years to eliminate it. On cheap grades\r\nof steel, not subject to any abnormal strain or stress, 0.1 per\r\ncent phosphorus is not objectionable. High phosphorus makes steel\r\n\"cold short,\" i.e., brittle when cold or moderately warm.\r\n\r\nSULPHUR\r\n\r\nSulphur is another impurity and high sulphur is even a greater\r\ndetriment to steel than phosphorus. High sulphur up to 0.09 per\r\ncent helps machining properties, but has a tendency to make the\r\nsteel \"hot short,\" i.e., subject to opening up cracks and seams\r\nat forging or rolling heats. Sulphur should never exceed 0.06 per\r\ncent nor phosphorus 0.08 per cent.\r\n\r\nSteel used for tool purposes should have as low phosphorus and sulphur\r\ncontents as possible, not over 0.02 per cent.\r\n\r\nWe can sum up the various factors something as follows for ready\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nThe ingredient        Its effect\r\n\r\n  Iron            The basis of steel\r\n  Carbon          The determinative\r\n  Sulphur         A strength sapper\r\n  Phosphorus      The weak link\r\n  Oxygen          A strength destroyer\r\n  Manganese       For strength\r\n  Nickel          For strength and toughness\r\n  Tungsten        Hardener and heat resister\r\n  Chromium        For resisting shocks\r\n  Vanadium        Purifier and fatigue resister\r\n  Silicon         Impurity and hardener\r\n  Titanium        Removes nitrogen and oxygen\r\n  Molybdenum      Hardener and heat resister\r\n  Aluminum        Kills or deoxidizes steel\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES OF ALLOY STEELS\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the percentages of carbon, manganese,\r\nnickel, chromium and vanadium in typical steel alloys for engineering\r\npurposes. It also gives the elastic limit, tensile strength, elongation\r\nand reduction of area of the various alloys, all being given the same\r\nheat treatment with a drawing temperature of 1,100°F. (600°C.). The\r\nspecimens were one inch rounds machined after heat treatment.\r\n\r\nTungsten is not shown in the table because it is seldom used in\r\nengineering construction steels and then usually in combination\r\nwith chromium. Tungsten is used principally for the magnets of\r\nmagnetos, to some extent in the manufacture of hacksaws, and for\r\nspecial tool steels.\r\n\r\nTABLE I.--PROPERTIES OF ALLOY STEELS\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     \\Manganese,/    \\Chromium,/       |Elastic|Tensile  |Elongation|Reduction\r\nCarbon,\\ per  /Nickel,\\ per  /Vanadium,|limit, |Strength,|in 2 in., | of area,\r\n  per  | cent | per   | cent |per cent |lb. per|lb. per  |per cent  | per cent\r\n  cent |      | cent  |      |         |sq. in.|sq. in.  |          |\r\n-------|------|-------|------|---------|-------|---------|----------|---------\r\n  0.27 | 0.55 |       |      |         | 49,000|  80,000 |    30    |    65\r\n  0.27 | 0.47 |       |      |  0.26   | 66,000|  98,000 |    25    |    52\r\n  0.36 | 0.42 |       |      |         | 58,000|  90,000 |    27    |    60\r\n  0.34 | 0.87 |       |      |  0.13   | 82,500| 103,000 |    22    |    57\r\n  0.45 | 0.50 |       |      |         | 65,000|  96,000 |    22    |    52\r\n  0.43 | 0.60 |       |      |  0.32   | 96,000| 122,000 |    21    |    52\r\n  0.47 | 0.90 |       |      |  0.15   |102,000| 127,500 |    23    |    58\r\n  0.30 | 0.60 | 3.40  |      |         | 75,000| 105,000 |    25    |    67\r\n  0.33 | 0.63 | 3.60  |      |  0.25   |118,000| 142,000 |    17    |    57\r\n  0.30 | 0.49 | 3.60  | 1.70 |         |119,000| 149,500 |    21    |    60\r\n  0.25 | 0.47 | 3.47  | 1.60 |  0.15   |139,000| 170,000 |    18    |    53\r\n  0.25 | 0.50 | 2.00  | 1.00 |         |102,000| 124,000 |    25    |    70\r\n  0.38 | 0.30 | 2.08  | 1.16 |         |120,000| 134,000 |    20    |    57\r\n  0.42 | 0.22 | 2.14  | 1.27 |  0.26   |145,000| 161,500 |    16    |    53\r\n  0.36 | 0.61 | 1.46  | 0.64 |         |117,600| 132,500 |    16    |    58\r\n  0.36 | 0.50 | 1.30  | 0.75 |  0.16   |140,000| 157,500 |    17    |    54\r\n  0.30 | 0.50 |       | 0.80 |         | 90,000| 105,000 |    20    |    50\r\n  0.23 | 0.58 |       | 0.82 |  0.17   |106,000| 124,000 |    21    |    66\r\n  0.26 | 0.48 |       | 0.92 |  0.20   |112,000| 137,000 |    20    |    61\r\n  0.35 | 0.64 |       | 1.03 |  0.22   |132,500| 149,500 |    16    |    54\r\n  0.50 | 0.92 |       | 1.02 |  0.20   |170,000| 186,000 |    15    |    45\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNON-SHRINKING, OIL-HARDENING STEELS\r\n\r\nCertain steels have a very low rate of expansion and contraction\r\nin hardening and are very desirable for test plugs, gages, punches\r\nand dies, for milling cutters, taps, reamers, hard steel bushings\r\nand similar work.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that for forging these steels it be heated slowly\r\nand uniformly to a bright red, but not in a direct flame or blast.\r\nHarden at a dull red heat, about 1,300°F. A clean coal or coke\r\nfire, or a good muffle-gas furnace will give best results. Fish\r\noil is good for quenching although in some cases warm water will\r\ngive excellent results. The steel should be kept moving in the bath\r\nuntil perfectly cold. Heated and cooled in this way the steel is\r\nvery tough, takes a good cutting edge and has very little expansion\r\nor contraction which makes it desirable for long taps where the\r\naccuracy of lead is important.\r\n\r\nThe composition of these steels is as follows:\r\n\r\n               Per cent\r\n  Manganese  1.40 to 1.60\r\n  Carbon     0.80 to 0.90\r\n  Vanadium   0.20 to 0.25\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Effect of copper in steel.]\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF COPPER IN MEDIUM-CARBON STEEL\r\n\r\nThis shows the result of tests by C. R. Hayward and A. B. Johnston\r\non two types of steel: one containing 0.30 per cent carbon, 0.012\r\nper cent phosphorus, and 0.860 per cent copper, and the other 0.365\r\nper cent carbon, 0.053 per cent phosphorus, and 0.030 per cent\r\ncopper. The accompanying chart in Fig. 13 shows that high-copper\r\nsteel has decided superiority in tensile strength, yield point and\r\nultimate strength, while the ductility is practically the same.\r\nHardness tests by both methods show high-copper steel to be harder\r\nthan low-copper, and the Charpy shock tests show high-copper steel\r\nalso superior to low-copper. The tests confirm those made by Stead,\r\nshowing that the behavior of copper steel resembles that of nickel\r\nsteel. The high-copper steels show finer grain than the low-copper.\r\nThe quenched and drawn specimens of high-copper steel were found\r\nto be slightly more martensitic.\r\n\r\nHIGH-CHROMIUM OR RUST-PROOF STEEL\r\n\r\nHigh-chromium, or what is called stainless steel containing from\r\n11 to 14 per cent chromium, was originally developed for cutlery\r\npurposes, but has in the past few years been used to a considerable\r\nextent for exhaust valves in airplane engines because of its resistance\r\nto scaling at high temperatures.\r\n\r\n                                Percentage\r\n  Carbon                       0.20 to 0.40\r\n  Manganese, not to exceed         0.50\r\n  Phosphorus, not to exceed        0.035\r\n  Sulphur, not to exceed           0.035\r\n  Chromium                    11.50 to 14.00\r\n  Silicon, not to exceed           0.30\r\n\r\nThe steel should be heated slowly and forged at a temperature above\r\n1,750°F. preferably between 1,800 and 2,200°F. If forged at temperatures\r\nbetween 1,650 and 1,750°F. there is considerable danger of rupturing\r\nthe steel because of its hardness at red heat. Owing to the\r\nair-hardening property of the steel, the drop-forgings should be\r\ntrimmed while hot. Thin forgings should be reheated to redness\r\nbefore trimming, as otherwise they are liable to crack.\r\n\r\nThe forgings will be hard if they are allowed to cool in air. This\r\nhardness varies over a range of from 250 to 500 Brinell, depending\r\non the original forging temperature.\r\n\r\nANNEALING can be done by heating to temperatures ranging from 1,290\r\nto 1,380°F. and cooling in air or quenching in water or oil. After\r\nthis treatment the forgings will have a hardness of about 200 Brinell\r\nand a tensile strength of 100,000 to 112,000 lb. per square inch.\r\nIf softer forgings are desired they can be heated to a temperature\r\nof from 1,560 to 1,650°F. and cooled very slowly. Although softer\r\nthe forgings will not machine as smoothly as when annealed at the\r\nlower temperature.\r\n\r\nHARDENING.--The forgings can be hardened by cooling in still air\r\nor quenching in oil or water from a temperature between 1,650 and\r\n1,750°F.\r\n\r\nThe physical properties do not vary greatly when the carbon is\r\nwithin the range of composition given, or when the steel is hardened\r\nand tempered in air, oil, or water.\r\n\r\nWhen used for valves the following specification of physical properties\r\nhave been used:\r\n\r\n  Yield point, pounds per square inch       70,000\r\n  Tensile strength, pounds per square inch  90,000\r\n  Elongation in 2 in., per cent                 18\r\n  Reduction of area, per cent                   50\r\n\r\nThe usual heat treatment is to quench in oil from 1,650°F. and\r\ntemper or draw at 1,100 to 1,200°F. One valve manufacturer stated\r\nthat valves of this steel are hardened by heating the previously\r\nannealed valves to 1,650°F. and cooling in still air. This treatment\r\ngives a scleroscope hardness of about 50.\r\n\r\nIn addition to use in valves this steel should prove very satisfactory\r\nfor shafting for water-pumps and other automobile parts subject to\r\nobjectionable corrosion.\r\n\r\n      TABLE 2.--COMPARISON OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES FOR HIGH-CHROMIUM\r\n                STEELS OF DIFFERENT CARBON CONTENT --------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                         | C   0.20 | C   0.27 | C   0.50\r\n                                         | Mn  0.45 | Mn  0.50 |\r\n                                         | Cr 12.56 | Cr 12.24 | Cr 14.84\r\n-----------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------\r\nQuenched in oil from degrees Fahrenheit  |   1,600  |   1,600  |   1,650\r\nTempered at degrees Fahrenheit           |   1,160  |   1,080  |   1,100\r\nYield point, pounds per square inch      |  78,300  |  75,000  |  91,616\r\nTensile strength, pounds per square inch | 104,600  | 104,250  | 123,648\r\nElongation in 2 in., per cent            |   25.0   |   23.5   |   14.5\r\nReduction of area, per cent              |   52.5   |   51.4   |   33.5\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.--COMPARISON OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES BETWEEN AIR, OIL AND\r\n          WATER-HARDENED STEEL HAVING CHEMICAL ANALYSIS IN\r\n          PERCENTAGE OF\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Carbon       0.24\r\n  Manganese    0.30\r\n  Phosphorus   0.035\r\n  Sulphur      0.035\r\n  Chromium    12.85\r\n  Silicon      0.20\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         | Hardened |           | Elastic | Tensile |          |\r\nHardening|  from,   | Tempered  | limit,  |strength,|Elongation|Reduction\r\nmedium   | degrees  |at, degrees| per lb. |lb.

Rough cut\r\nsurfaces will rust. Surfaces finished with a fine cut are less\r\nliable to rust. Ground and polished surfaces are practically immune\r\nto rust.\r\n\r\nWhen chromium content is increased to 16 to 18 per cent and silicon\r\nis added, from 2 to 4 per cent, this steel becomes rust proof in\r\nits raw state, as soon as the outside surface is removed. It does\r\nnot need to be heat-treated in any way. These compositions are\r\nboth patented.\r\n\r\nS. A. E.

The original specifications called\r\nfor chrome-nickel but the losses due to the difficulty of handling\r\ncaused the Lincoln Motor Company to suggest the substitution of\r\nchrome-vanadium steel, and this was accepted by the Signal Corps. The\r\nrods were accordingly made from chromium-vanadium steel, containing\r\ncarbon, 0.30 to 0.40 per cent; manganese, 0.50 to 0.80 per cent;\r\nphosphorus, not over 0.04 per cent; sulphur, not over 0.04 per\r\ncent; chromium, 0.80 to 1.10 per cent; vanadium, not less than 0.15\r\nper cent. This steel is ordinarily known in the trade as 0.35 carbon\r\nsteel, S. A. E., specification 6,135, which provides a first-rate\r\nquality steel for structural parts that are to be heat-treated.\r\nThe fatigue resisting or endurance qualities of this material are\r\nexcellent. It has a tensile strength of 150,000 lb. minimum per\r\nsquare inch; elastic limit, 115,000 lb. minimum per square inch;\r\nelongation, 5 per cent minimum in 2 in.; and minimum reduction\r\nin area, 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe original production system as outlined for the manufacturers\r\nhad called for a heat treatment in the rough-forged state for the\r\nconnecting rods, and then semi-machining the rod forgings before\r\ngiving them the final treatment. The Lincoln Motor Company insisted\r\nfrom the first that the proper method would be a complete heat\r\ntreatment of the forging in the rough state, and machining the\r\nrod after the heat treatment. After a number of trial lots, the\r\nSignal Corps acceded to the request and production was immediately\r\nincreased and quality benefited by the change. This method was\r\nlater included in a revised specification issued to all producers.\r\n\r\nThe original system was one that required a great deal of labor\r\nper unit output. The Lincoln organization developed a method of\r\nhandling connecting rods whereby five workmen accomplished the\r\nsame result that would have required about 30 or 32 by the original\r\nmethod. Even after revising the specification so as to allow complete\r\nheat treatments in the rough-forged state, the ordinary methods\r\nemployed in heat-treating would have required 12 to 15 men. With\r\nthe fixtures employed, five men could handle 1,300 connecting rods,\r\nhalf of which are plain and half, forked, in a working period of\r\nlittle over 7 hr.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Rack for holding rods.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Sliding rods into tank.]\r\n\r\nThe increase in production was gained by devising fixtures which\r\nenabled fewer men to handle a greater quantity of parts with less\r\neffort and in less time.\r\n\r\nIn heat-treating the forgings were laid on a rack or loop _A_,\r\nFig. 14, made of 1-1/4-in. double extra-heavy pipe, bent up with\r\nparallel sides about 9 in. apart, one end being bent straight across\r\nand the other end being bent upward so as to afford an easy grasp\r\nfor the hook. Fifteen rods were laid on each loop, there being\r\nfour loops of rods charged into a furnace with a hearth area of 36\r\nby 66 in. The rods were charged at a temperature of approximately\r\n900°F. They were heated for refining over a period of 3 hr. to\r\n1,625°F., soaked 15 min, at this degree of heat and quenched in\r\nsoluble quenching oil.\r\n\r\nIn pulling the heat to quench the rods, the furnace door was raised\r\nand the operator pulls one of the loops _A_, Fig. 15 forward to\r\nthe shelf of the furnace, supporting the straight end of the loop\r\nby means of the porter bar _B_. They swung the loop of rods around\r\nfrom the furnace shelf and set the straight end of the loop on\r\nthe edge of the quenching tank, then raise the curved end _C_,\r\nby means of their hook _D_ so that all the rods on the loop slide\r\ninto the oil bath.\r\n\r\nBefore the rods cooled entirely, the baskets in the quenching tank\r\nwere raised and the oil allowed to partly drain off the forgings,\r\nand they were stacked on curved-end loops or racks and charged into\r\nthe furnace for the second or hardening heat. The temperature of\r\nthe furnace was raised in 1-1/2 hr. to 1,550°F., the rods soaked\r\nfor 15 min. at this degree of heat and quenched in the same manner\r\nas above.\r\n\r\nThey were again drained while yet warm, placed on loops and charged\r\ninto the furnace for the third or tempering heat. The temperature of\r\nthe furnace was brought to 1,100°F. in 1 hr., and the rods soaked at\r\nthis degree of heat for 1 hr. They were then removed from the furnace\r\nthe same as for quenching, but were dumped onto steel platforms\r\ninstead of into the quenching oil, and allowed to cool on these\r\nsteel platforms down to the room temperature.\r\n\r\nPICKLING THE FORGINGS\r\n\r\nThe forgings were then pickled in a hot solution of either niter\r\ncake or sulphuric acid and water at a temperature of 170°F., and\r\nusing a solution of about 25 per cent. The solution was maintained\r\nat a constant point by taking hydrometer readings two or three\r\ntimes a day, maintaining a reading of about 1.175. Sixty forked or\r\none hundred single rods were placed in wooden racks and immersed\r\nin a lead-lined vat 30 by 30 by 5 ft. long. The rack was lowered\r\nor lifted by means of an air hoist and the rods were allowed to\r\nstay in solution from 1/2 to 1 hr., depending on the amount of\r\nscale. The rods were then swung and lowered in the rack into running\r\nhot water until all trace of the acid was removed.\r\n\r\nThe rod was finally subjected to Brinell test. This shows whether\r\nor not the rod has been heat-treated to the proper hardness. If\r\nthe rods did not read between 241 and 277, they were re-treated\r\nuntil the proper hardness is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION OF LIBERTY ENGINE MATERIALS TO THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Paper presented at the summer meeting of the S. A.\r\nE. at Ottawa Beach in June, 1919.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the Liberty engine program was an engineering achievement\r\nin which the science of metallurgy played an important part. The\r\nreasons for the use of certain materials and certain treatments\r\nfor each part are given with recommendations for their application\r\nto the problems of automotive industry.\r\n\r\nThe most important items to be taken into consideration in the\r\nselection of material for parts of this type are uniformity and\r\nmachineability. It has been demonstrated many times that the ordinary\r\ngrades of bessemer screw stock are unsatisfactory for aviation\r\npurposes, due to the presence of excessive amounts of unevenly\r\ndistributed phosphorus and sulphide segregations. For this reason,\r\nmaterial finished by the basic open hearth process was selected,\r\nin accordance with the following specifications: Carbon, 0.150 to\r\n0.250 per cent; manganese, 0.500 to 0.800 per cent; phosphorus,\r\n0.045 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.060 to 0.090 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis material in the cold-drawn condition will show: Elastic limit,\r\n50,000 lb. per square inch, elongation in 2 in., 10 per cent, reduction\r\nof area, 35 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis material gave as uniform physical properties as S. A. E. No.\r\n1020 steel and at the same time was sufficiently free cutting to\r\nproduce a smooth thread and enable the screw-machine manufacturers\r\nto produce, to the same thread limits, approximately 75 per cent\r\nas many parts as from bessemer screw stock.\r\n\r\nThere are but seven carbon-steel carbonized parts on the Liberty\r\nengine. The most important are the camshaft, the camshaft rocker\r\nlever roller and the tappet. The material used for parts of this\r\ntype was S. A. E. No. 1,020 steel, which is of the following chemical\r\nanalysis: Carbon 0.150 to 0.250 per cent; manganese, 0.300 to 0.600\r\nper cent; phosphorus, 0.045 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.050 maximum\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe heat treatment consisted in carbonizing at a temperature of\r\nfrom 1,650 to 1,700°F. for a sufficient length of time to secure\r\nthe proper depth of case, cool slowly or quench; then reheat to a\r\ntemperature of 1,380 to 1,430°F. to refine the grain of the case,\r\nand quench in water. The only thing that should limit the rate of\r\ncooling from the carbonizing heat is distortion. Camshaft rocker\r\nlever rollers and tappets, as well as gear pins, were quenched\r\ndirectly from the carbonizing heat in water and then case-refined\r\nand rehardened by quenching in water from a temperature of from\r\n1,380 to 1,430°F.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of direct quenching from the carbonizing heat is\r\ndoubtless one of economy, and in many cases will save the cost\r\nof a reheating. Specifications for case hardening, issued by the\r\nSociety of Automotive Engineers, have lately been revised; whereas\r\nthey formerly called for a slow cooling, they now permit a quenching\r\nfrom the pot. Doubtless this is a step in advance. Warpage caused\r\nby quenching can be reduced to a minimum by thoroughly annealing\r\nthe stock before any machine work is done on it.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage obtained from rapid cooling from the carbonizing\r\nheat is the retaining of the majority of the excess cementite in\r\nsolution which produces a less brittle case and by so doing reduces\r\nthe liability of grinding checks and chipping of the case in actual\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the camshaft, it is not possible to quench directly\r\nfrom the carbonizing heat because of distortion and therefore excessive\r\nbreakage during straightening operations. All Liberty camshafts\r\nwere cooled slowly from carbonizing heat and hardened by a single\r\nreheating to a temperature of from 1,380 to 1,430°F. and quenching\r\nin water.\r\n\r\nConsiderable trouble has always been experienced in obtaining uniform\r\nhardness on finished camshafts. This is caused by insufficient\r\nwater circulation in the quenching tank, which allows the formation\r\nof steam pockets to take place, or by decarbonization of the case\r\nduring heating by the use of an overoxidizing flame. Another cause,\r\nwhich is very often overlooked, is due to the case being ground off\r\none side of cam more than the other and is caused by the roughing\r\nmaster cam being slightly different from the finishing master cam.\r\nGreat care should be taken to see that this condition does not occur,\r\nespecially when the depth of case is between 1/32 and 3/64 in.\r\n\r\nCARBON-STEEL FORGINGS\r\n\r\nLow-stressed, carbon-steel forgings include such parts as carbureter\r\ncontrol levers, etc. The important criterion for parts of this type\r\nis ease of fabrication and freedom from over-heated and burned\r\nforgings. The material used for such parts was S. A. E. No. 1,030\r\nsteel, which is of the following chemical composition: Carbon, 0.250\r\nto 0.350 per cent; manganese, 0.500 to 0.800 per cent; phosphorus,\r\n0.045 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.050 maximum per cent.\r\n\r\nTo obtain good machineability, all forgings produced from this\r\nsteel were heated to a temperature of from 1,575 to 1,625°F. to\r\nrefine the grain of the steel thoroughly and quenched in water\r\nand then tempered to obtain proper machineability by heating to a\r\ntemperature of from 1,000 to 1,100°F. and cooled slowly or quenched.\r\n\r\nForgings subjected to this heat treatment are free from hard spots\r\nand will show a Brinell hardness of 177 to 217, which is proper for\r\nall ordinary machining operations. Great care should be taken not\r\nto use steel for parts of this type containing less than 0.25 per\r\ncent carbon, because the lower the carbon the greater the liability\r\nof hard spots, and the more difficult it becomes to eliminate them.\r\nThe only satisfactory method so far in commercial use for the\r\nelimination of hard spots is to give forgings a very severe quench\r\nfrom a high temperature followed by a proper tempering heat to\r\nsecure good machine ability as outlined above.\r\n\r\nThe important carbon-steel forgings consisted of the cylinders,\r\nthe propeller-hubs, the propeller-hub flange, etc. The material\r\nused for parts of this type was S. A. E. No. 1,045 steel, which\r\nis of the following chemical composition: Carbon, 0.400 to 0.500\r\nper cent; manganese, 0.500 to 0.800 per cent; phosphorus, 0.045\r\nmaximum per cent; sulphur, 0.050 maximum per cent.\r\n\r\nAll forgings made from this material must show, after heat treatment,\r\nthe following minimum physical properties: Elastic limit, 70,000;\r\nlb. per square inch, elongation in 2 in., 18 per cent, reduction\r\nof area, 45; per cent, Brinell hardness, 217 to 255.\r\n\r\nTo obtain these physical properties, the forgings were quenched in\r\nwater from a temperature of 1,500 to 1,550°F., followed by tempering\r\nto meet proper Brinell requirements by heating to a temperature\r\nof 1,150 to 1,200°F. and cooled slowly or quenched. No trouble\r\nof any kind was ever experienced with parts of this type.\r\n\r\nThe principal carbon-steel pressed parts used on the Liberty engine\r\nwere the water jackets and the exhaust manifolds. The material\r\nused for parts of this type was S. A. E. No. 1,010 steel, which\r\nis of the following chemical composition: Carbon, 0.05 to 0.15 per\r\ncent; manganese, 0.30 to 0.60 per cent; phosphorus, 0.045 maximum\r\nper cent; sulphur, 0.045 maximum per cent.\r\n\r\nNo trouble was experienced in the production of any parts from\r\nthis material with the exception of the water jacket. Due to the\r\nparticular design of the Liberty cylinder assembly, many failures\r\noccurred in the early days, due to the top of the jacket cracking\r\nwith a brittle fracture. It was found that these failures were\r\ncaused primarily from the use of jackets which showed small scratches\r\nor die marks at this joint and secondarily by improper annealing of\r\nthe jackets themselves between the different forming operations.\r\nBy a careful inspection for die marks and by giving the jackets\r\n1,400°F. annealing before the last forming operation, it was possible\r\nto completely eliminate the trouble encountered.\r\n\r\nHIGHLY STRESSED PARTS\r\n\r\nThe highly stressed parts on the Liberty engine consisted of the\r\nconnecting-rod bolt, the main-bearing bolt, the propeller-hub key,\r\netc. The material used for parts of this type was selected at the\r\noption of the manufacturer from standard S. A. E. steels, the\r\ncomposition of which are given in Table 11.\r\n\r\nTABLE 11.--COMPOSITION OF S. A. E. STEELS Nos. 2,330, 3,135 AND 6,130\r\n\r\n  Steel No              2,330   3,135   6,130\r\n  Carbon, minimum       0.250   0.300   0.250\r\n  Carbon, maximum       0.350   0.400   0.450\r\n  Manganese, minimum    0.500   0.500   0.500\r\n  Manganese, maximum    0.800   0.800   0.800\r\n  Phosphorus, maximum   0.045   0.040   0.040\r\n  Sulphur, maximum      0.045   0.045   0.045\r\n  Nickel, minimum       3.250   1.000\r\n  Nickel, maximum       3.750   1.500\r\n  Chromium, minimum             0.450   0.800\r\n  Chromium, maximum             0.750   1.100\r\n  Vanadium, minimum                     0.150\r\n\r\nAll highly stressed parts on the Liberty engine must show, after\r\nheat treatment, the following minimum physical properties: Elastic\r\nlimit, 100,000 lb. per square inch; elongation in 2 in., 16 per\r\ncent; reduction of area, 45 per cent; scleroscope hardness, 40\r\nto 50.\r\n\r\nThe heat treatment employed to obtain these physical properties\r\nconsisted in quenching from a temperature of 1,525 to 1,575°F., in\r\noil, followed by tempering at a temperature of from 925 to 975°F.\r\n\r\nDue to the extremely fine limits used on all threaded parts for\r\nthe Liberty engine, a large percentage of rejection was due to\r\nwarpage and scaling of parts. To eliminate this objection, many\r\nof the Liberty engine builders adopted the use of heat-treated\r\nand cold-drawn alloy steel for their highly stressed parts. On\r\nall sizes up to and including 3/8 in. in diameter, the physical\r\nproperties were secured by merely normalizing the hot-rolled bars\r\nby heating to a temperature of from 1,525 to 1,575°F., and cooling\r\nin air, followed by the usual cold-drawing reductions. For parts\r\nrequiring stock over 3/8 in. in diameter, the physical properties\r\ndesired were obtained by quenching and tempering the hot-rolled bars\r\nbefore cold-drawing. It is the opinion that the use of heat-treated\r\nand cold-drawn bars is very good practice, provided proper inspection\r\nis made to guarantee the uniformity of heat treatment and, therefore,\r\nthe uniformity of the physical properties of the finished parts.\r\n\r\nThe question has been asked many times by different manufacturers, as\r\nto which alloy steel offers the best machineability when heat-treated\r\nto a given Brinell hardness. The general consensus of opinion among\r\nthe screw-machine manufacturers is that S. A. E. No. 6,130 steel\r\ngives the best machineability and that S. A. E. No. 2,330 steel\r\nwould receive second choice of the three specified.\r\n\r\nIn the finishing of highly stressed parts for aviation engines,\r\nextreme care must be taken to see that all tool marks are eliminated,\r\nunless they are parallel to the axis of strain, and that proper\r\nradii are maintained at all changes of section. This is of the\r\nutmost importance to give proper fatigue resistance to the part\r\nin question.\r\n\r\nGEARS\r\n\r\nThe material used for all gears on the Liberty engine was selected\r\nat the option of the manufacturer from the following standard S.\r\nA. E. steels, the composition of which are given in Table 12,\r\n\r\nTABLE 12.--COMPOSITION OF STEELS NOS. X-3,340 AND 6,140\r\n\r\n  Steel No              X-3,340   6,140\r\n  Carbon, minimum        0.350    0.350\r\n  Carbon, maximum        0.450    0.450\r\n  Manganese, minimum     0.450    0.500\r\n  Manganese, maximum     0.750    0.800\r\n  Phosphorus, maximum    0.040    0.040\r\n  Sulphur, maximum       0.045    0.045\r\n  Nickel, minimum        2.750\r\n  Nickel, maximum        3.250\r\n  Chromium, minimum      0.700    0.800\r\n  Chromium, maximum      0.950    1.100\r\n  Vanadium, minimum               0.150\r\n\r\nAll gears were heat-treated to a scleroscope hardness of from 55\r\nto 55. The heat treatment used to secure this hardness consisted\r\nin quenching the forgings from a temperature of 1,550 to 1,600°F.\r\nin oil and annealing for good machineability at a temperature of\r\nfrom 1,300 to 1,350°F. Forgings treated in this manner showed a\r\nBrinell hardness of from 177 to 217.\r\n\r\nRATE OF COOLING\r\n\r\nAt the option of the manufacturer, the above treatment of gear\r\nforgings could be substituted by normalizing the forgings at a\r\ntemperature of from 1,550 to 1,600°F. The most important criterion\r\nfor proper normalizing, consisted in allowing the forgings to cool\r\nthrough the critical temperature of the steel, at a rate not to exceed\r\n50°F. per hour. For the two standard steels used, this consisted in\r\ncooling from the normalizing temperature down to a temperature\r\nof 1,100°F., at the rate indicated. Forgings normalized in this\r\nmanner will show a Brinell hardness of from 177 to 217. The question\r\nhas been repeatedly asked as to which treatment will produce the\r\nhigher quality finished part. In answer to this I will state that\r\non simple forgings of comparatively small section, the normalizing\r\ntreatment will produce a finished part which is of equal quality to\r\nthat of the quenched and annealed forgings. However, in the case of\r\ncomplex forgings, or those of large section, more uniform physical\r\nproperties of the finished part will be obtained by quenching and\r\nannealing the forgings in the place of normalizing.\r\n\r\nThe heat treatment of the finished gears consisted of quenching\r\nin oil from a temperature of from 1,420 to 1,440°F. for the No.\r\nX-3,340 steel, or from a temperature of from 1,500 to 1,540°F.\r\nfor No. 6,140 steel, followed by tempering in saltpeter or in an\r\nelectric furnace at a temperature of from 650 to 700°F.\r\n\r\nThe question has been asked by many engineers, why is the comparatively\r\nlow scleroscope hardness specified for gears? The reason for this is\r\nthat at best the life of an aviation engine is short, as compared with\r\nthat of an automobile, truck or tractor, and that shock resistance\r\nis of vital importance. A sclerescope hardness of from 55 to 65\r\nwill give sufficient resistance to wear to prevent replacements\r\nduring the life of an aviation engine, while at the same time this\r\nhardness produces approximately 50 per cent greater shock-resisting\r\nproperties to the gear. In the case of the automobile, truck or\r\ntractor, resistance to wear is the main criterion and for that\r\nreason the higher hardness is specified.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be taken in the design of an aviation engine\r\ngear to eliminate sharp corners at the bottom of teeth as well\r\nas in keyways. Any change of section in any stressed part of an\r\naviation engine must have a radius of at least 1/32 in. to give\r\nproper shock and fatigue resistance. This fact has been demonstrated\r\nmany times during the Liberty engine program.\r\n\r\nCONNECTING RODS\r\n\r\nThe material used for all connecting rods on the Liberty engine\r\nwas selected at the option of the manufacturer from one of two\r\nstandard S. A. E. steels, the composition of which are given in\r\nTable 13.\r\n\r\nTABLE 13.--COMPOSITION OF STEELS NOS. X-3,335 AND 6,135\r\n\r\n  Steel No.             X-3,335  6,135\r\n  Carbon, minimum        0.300   0.300\r\n  Carbon, maximum        0.400   0.400\r\n  Manganese, minimum     0.450   0.500\r\n  Manganese, maximum     0.750   0.800\r\n  Phosphorus, maximum    0.040   0.040\r\n  Sulphur, maximum       0.045   0.045\r\n  Nickel, minimum        2.750\r\n  Nickel, maximum        3.250\r\n  Chromium, minimum      0.700   0.800\r\n  Chromium, maximum      0.950   1.100\r\n  Vanadium minimum               0.150\r\n\r\nAll connecting rods were heat-treated to show the following minimum\r\nphysical properties; Elastic limit, 105,000 lb. per square inch:\r\nelongation in 2 in., 17.5; per cent, reduction of area 50.0; per\r\ncent., Brinell hardness, 241 to 277.\r\n\r\nThe heat treatment used to secure these physical properties consisted\r\nin normalizing the forgings at a temperature of from 1,550 to 1,600°F.,\r\nfollowed by cooling in the furnace or in air. The forgings were then\r\nquenched in oil from a temperature of from 1,420 to 1,440°F. for the\r\nNo. X-3,335 steel, or from a temperature of from 1,500 to 1,525°F.\r\nfor No. 6,135 steel, followed by tempering at a temperature of from\r\n1,075 to 1,150°F. At the option of the manufacturer, the normalizing\r\ntreatment could be substituted by quenching the forgings from a\r\ntemperature of from 1,550 to 1,600°F., in oil, and annealing for\r\nthe best machineability at a temperature of from 1,300 to 1,350°F.\r\nThe double quench, however, did not prove satisfactory on No. X-3,335\r\nsteel, due to the fact that it was necessary to remove forgings\r\nfrom the quenching bath while still at a temperature of from 300\r\nto 500°F. to eliminate any possibility of cracking. In view of the\r\nfact that this practice is difficult to carry out in the average\r\nheat-treating plant, considerable trouble was experienced.\r\n\r\nThe most important criterion in the production of aviation engine\r\nconnecting rods is the elimination of burned or severely overheated\r\nforgings. Due to the particular design of the forked rod, considerable\r\ntrouble was experienced in this respect because of the necessity\r\nof reheating the forgings before they are completely forged. As\r\na means of elimination of burned forgings, test lugs were forged\r\non the channel section as well as on the top end of fork. After\r\nthe finish heat treatment, these test lugs were nicked and broken\r\nand the fracture of the steel carefully examined. This precaution\r\nmade it possible to eliminate burned forgings as the test lugs were\r\nplaced on sections which would be most likely to become burned.\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference of opinion among engineers as to what\r\nphysical properties an aviation engine connecting rod should have.\r\nMany of the most prominent engineers contend that a connecting rod\r\nshould be as stiff as possible. To produce rods in this manner in\r\nany quantity, it is necessary for the final heat treatment to be made\r\non the semi-machined rod. This practice would make it necessary for a\r\nlarger percentage of the semi-machined rods to be cold-straightened\r\nafter the finish heat treatment. The cold-straightening operation\r\non a part having important functions to perform as a connecting\r\nrod is extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that a connecting rod functions as a strut,\r\nit is considered that this part should be only stiff enough to\r\nprevent any whipping action during the running of the engine. The\r\ngreater the fatigue-resisting property that one can put into the\r\nrod after this stiffness is reached, the longer the life of the\r\nrod will be. This is the reason for the Brinell limits mentioned\r\nbeing specified.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the connecting rod, emphasis must be laid on the\r\nimportance of proper radii at all changes of section. The connecting\r\nrods for the first few Liberty engines were machined with sharp\r\ncorners at the point where the connecting-rod bolt-head fits on\r\nassembly. On the first long endurance test of a Liberty engine\r\nequipped with rods of this type, failure resulted from fatigue\r\nstarting at this point. It is interesting to note that every rod on\r\nthe engine which did not completely fail at this point had started\r\nto crack. The adoption of a 1/32-in. radius at this point completely\r\neliminated fatigue failures on Liberty rods.\r\n\r\nCRANKSHAFT\r\n\r\nThe crankshaft was the most highly stressed part of the entire\r\nLiberty engine, and, therefore, every metallurgical precaution\r\nwas taken to guarantee the quality of this part. The material used\r\nfor the greater portion of the Liberty crankshafts produced was\r\nnickel-chromium steel of the following chemical composition: Carbon,\r\n0.350 to 0.450 per cent; manganese, 0.300 to 0.600 per cent; phosphorus,\r\n0.040 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.045 maximum per cent; nickel,\r\n1.750 to 2.250 per cent; chromium, 0.700 to 0.900 per cent.\r\n\r\nEach crankshaft was heat-treated to show the following minimum\r\nphysical properties: Elastic limit, 116,000 lb. per square inch;\r\nelongation in 2 in., 16 per cent, reduction of area, 50 per cent,\r\nIzod impact, 34 ft.-lb.; Brinell hardness, 266 to 321.\r\n\r\nFor every increase of 4,000 lb. per square inch in the elastic\r\nlimit above 116,000 lb. per square inch, the minimum Izod impact\r\nrequired was reduced 1 ft.-lb.\r\n\r\nThe heat treatment used to produce these physical properties consisted\r\nin normalizing the forgings at a temperature of from 1,550 to 1,600°F.,\r\nfollowed by quenching in water at a temperature of from 1,475 to\r\n1,525°F. and tempering at a temperature of from 1,000 to 1,100°F.\r\nIt is absolutely necessary that the crankshafts be removed from the\r\nquenching tank before being allowed to cool below a temperature of\r\n500°F., and immediately placed in the tempering furnace to eliminate\r\nthe possibility of quenching cracks.\r\n\r\nA prolongation of not less than the diameter of the forging bearing\r\nwas forged on one end of each crankshaft. This was removed from\r\nthe shaft after the finish heat treatment, and physical tests were\r\nmade on test specimens which were cut from it at a point half way\r\nbetween the center and the surface. One tensile test and one impact\r\ntest were made on each crankshaft, and the results obtained were\r\nrecorded against the serial number of the shaft in question. This\r\nserial number was carried through all machining operations and\r\nstamped on the cheek of the finished shaft. In addition to the\r\nabove tensile and impact tests, at least two Brinell hardness\r\ndeterminations were made on each shaft.\r\n\r\nAll straightening operations on the Liberty crankshaft which were\r\nperformed below a temperature of 500°F. were followed by retempering\r\nat a temperature of approximately 200°F. below the original tempering\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the importance of proper radii at all changes\r\nof section is given in the case of the Liberty crankshaft. The presence\r\nof tool marks or under cuts must be completely eliminated from an\r\naviation engine crankshaft to secure proper service. During the\r\nduration of the Liberty program, four crankshafts failed from fatigue,\r\nfailures starting from sharp corners at bottom of propeller-hub\r\nkeyway. Two of the shafts that failed showed torsional spirals\r\nrunning more than completely around the shaft. As soon as this\r\ndifficulty was removed no further trouble was experienced.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important difficulties encountered in connection\r\nwith the production of Liberty crankshafts was hair-line seams. The\r\nquestion of hair-line seams has been discussed to greater length\r\nby engineers and metallurgists during the war than any other single\r\nquestion. Hair-line seams are caused by small non-metallic inclusions\r\nin the steel. There is every reason to believe that these inclusions\r\nare in the greater majority of cases manganese sulphide. There is\r\na great difference of opinion as to the exact effect of hair-line\r\nseams on the service of an aviation engine crankshaft. It is the\r\nopinion of many that hair-line seams do not in any way affect the\r\nendurance of a crankshaft in service, provided they are parallel to\r\nthe grain of the steel and do not occur on a fillet. Of the 20,000\r\nLiberty engines produced, fully 50 per cent of the crankshafts\r\nused contain hair-line seams but not at the locations mentioned.\r\nThere has never been a failure of a Liberty crankshaft which could\r\nin any way be traced to hair-line seams.\r\n\r\nIt was found that hair-line seams occur generally on high\r\nnickel-chromium steels. One of the main reasons why the comparatively\r\nmild analysis nickel-chromium steel was used was due to the very\r\nfew hair-line seams present in it. It was also determined that\r\nthe hair lines will in general be found near the surface of the\r\nforgings. For that reason, as much finish as possible was allowed\r\nfor machining. A number of tests have been made on forging bars\r\nto determine the depths at which hair-line seams are found, and\r\nmany cases came up in which hair-line seams were found 3/8 in.\r\nfrom the surface of the bar. This means that in case a crankshaft\r\ndoes not show hair-line seams on the ground surface this is no\r\nindication that it is free from such a defect.\r\n\r\nOne important peculiarity of nickel-chromium steel was brought\r\nout from the results obtained on impact tests. This peculiarity\r\nis known as \"blue brittleness.\" Just what the effect of this is\r\non the service of a finished part depends entirely upon the design\r\nof the particular part in question. There have been no failures of\r\nany nickel-chromium steel parts in the automotive industry which\r\ncould in any way be traced to this phenomena.\r\n\r\nWhether or not nickel-chromium-steel forgings will show \"blue\r\nbrittleness\" depends entirely upon the temperature at which they\r\nare tempered and their rate of cooling from this temperature. The\r\ndanger range for tempering nickel-chromium steels is between a\r\ntemperature of from 400 to 1,100°F. From the data so far gathered\r\non this phenomena, it is necessary that the nickel-chromium steel\r\nto show \"blue brittleness\" be made by the acid process. There has\r\nnever come to my attention a single instance in which basic open\r\nhearth steel has shown this phenomena. Just why the acid open hearth\r\nsteel should be sensitive to \"blue brittleness\" is not known.\r\n\r\nAll that is necessary to eliminate the presence of \"blue brittleness\"\r\nis to quench all nickel-chromium-steel forgings in water from their\r\ntempering temperature. The last 20,000 Liberty crankshafts that\r\nwere made were quenched in this manner.\r\n\r\nPISTON PIN\r\n\r\nThe piston pin on an aviation engine must possess maximum resistance\r\nto wear and to fatigue. For this reason, the piston pin is considered,\r\nfrom a metallurgical standpoint, the most important part on the\r\nengine to produce in quantities and still possess the above\r\ncharacteristics. The material used for the Liberty engine piston\r\npin was S. A. E. No. 2315 steel, which is of the following chemical\r\ncomposition: Carbon, 0.100 to 0.200 per cent; manganese, 0.500\r\nto 0.800 per cent; phosphorus, 0.040 maximum per cent; sulphur,\r\n0.045 maximum per cent; nickel, 3.250 to 3.750 per cent.\r\n\r\nEach finished piston pin, after heat treatment, must show a minimum\r\nscleroscope hardness of the case of 70, a scleroscope hardness of\r\nthe core of from 35 to 55 and a minimum crushing strength when\r\nsupported as a beam and the load applied at the center of 35,000\r\nlb. The heat treatment used to obtain the above physical properties\r\nconsisted in carburizing at a temperature not to exceed 1,675°F.,\r\nfor a sufficient length of time to secure a case of from 0.02 to\r\n0.04 in. deep. The pins are then allowed to cool slowly from the\r\ncarbonizing heat, after which the hole is finish-machined and the\r\npin cut to length. The finish heat treatment of the piston pin\r\nconsisted in quenching in oil from a temperature of from 1,525 to\r\n1,575°F. to refine the grain of core properly and then quenching in\r\noil at a temperature of from 1,340 to 1,380°F. to refine and harden\r\nthe grain of the case properly, as well as to secure proper hardness\r\nof core. After this quenching, all piston pins are tempered in oil\r\nat a temperature of from 375 to 400°F. A 100 per cent inspection\r\nfor scleroscope hardness of the case and the core was made, and\r\nno failures were ever recorded when the above material and heat\r\ntreatment was used.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION TO THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe information given on the various parts of the Liberty engine\r\napplies with equal force to the corresponding parts in the construction\r\nof an automobile, truck or tractor. We recommend as first choice for\r\ncarbon-steel screw-machine parts material produced by the basic\r\nopen hearth process and having the following chemical composition;\r\nCarbon, 0.150 to 0.250 per cent; manganese, 0.500 to 0.800 per\r\ncent; phosphorus, 0.045 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.075 to 0.150\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThis material is very uniform and is nearly as free cutting as\r\nbessemer screw stock. It is sufficiently uniform to be used for\r\nunimportant carburized parts, as well as for non-heat-treated\r\nscrew-machine parts. A number of the large automobile manufacturers\r\nare now specifying this material in preference to the regular bessemer\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\nAs second choice for carbon-steel screw-machine parts we recommend\r\nordinary bessemer screw stock, purchased in accordance with S. A.\r\nE. specification No. 1114. The advantage of using No. 1114 steel\r\nlies in the fact that the majority of warehouses carry standard\r\nsizes of this material in stock at all times. The disadvantage\r\nof using this material is due to its lack of uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe important criterion for transmission gears is resistance to\r\nwear. To secure proper resistance to wear a Brinell hardness of\r\nfrom 512 to 560 must be obtained. The material selected to obtain\r\nthis hardness should be one which can be made most nearly uniform,\r\nwill undergo forging operations the easiest, will be the hardest\r\nto overheat or burn, will machine best and will respond to a good\r\ncommercial range of heat treatment.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the element chromium, when in the form\r\nof chromium carbide in alloy steel, offers the greatest resistance to\r\nwear of any combination yet developed. It is also a well-known fact that\r\nthe element nickel in steel gives excellent shock-resisting properties\r\nas well as resistance to wear but not nearly as great a resistance\r\nto wear as chromium. It has been standard practice for a number of\r\nyears for many manufacturers to use a high nickel-chromium steel\r\nfor transmission gears. A typical nickel-chromium gear specification\r\nis as follows: Carbon, 0.470 to 0.520 per cent; manganese, 0.500\r\nto 0.800 per cent; phosphorus, 0.040 maximum per cent; sulphur,\r\n0.045 maximum per cent; chromium, 0.700 to 0.950 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that a gear made from material of such an\r\nanalysis will give excellent service. However, it is possible to\r\nobtain the same quality of service and at the same time appreciably\r\nreduce the cost of the finished part. The gear steel specified is\r\nof the air-hardening type. It is extremely sensitive to secondary\r\npipe, as well as seams, and is extremely difficult to forge and\r\nvery easy to overheat. The heat-treatment range is very wide, but\r\nthe danger from quenching cracks is very great. In regard to the\r\nmachineability, this material is the hardest to machine of any\r\nalloy steel known.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF TRANSMISSION-GEAR STEEL\r\n\r\nIf the nickel content of this steel is eliminated, and the percentage\r\nof chromium raised slightly, an ideal transmission-gear material is\r\nobtained. This would, therefore, be of the following composition:\r\nCarbon, 0.470 to 0.520 per cent; manganese, 0.500 to 0.800 per\r\ncent; phosphorus, 0.040 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.045 maximum\r\nper cent; chromium, 0.800 to 1.100 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe important criterion in connection with the use of this material\r\nis that the steel be properly deoxidized, either through the use\r\nof ferrovanadium or its equivalent. Approximately 2,500 sets of\r\ntransmission gears are being made daily from material of this analysis\r\nand are giving entirely satisfactory results in service. The heat\r\ntreatment of the above material for transmission gears is as follows:\r\n\"Normalize forgings at a temperature of from 1,5.50 to 1,600°F.\r\nCool from this temperature to a temperature of 1,100°F. at the\r\nrate of 50° per hour. Cool from 1,100°F., either in air or quench\r\nin water.\"\r\n\r\nForgings so treated will show a Brinell hardness of from 177 to\r\n217, which is the proper range for the best machineability. The\r\nheat treatment of the finished gears consists of quenching in oil\r\nfrom a temperature of 1,500 to 1,540°F., followed by tempering\r\nin oil at a temperature of from 375 to 425°F. Gears so treated\r\nwill show a Brinell hardness of from 512 to 560, or a scleroscope\r\nhardness of from 72 to 80. One tractor builder has placed in service\r\n20,000 sets of gears of this type of material and has never had to\r\nreplace a gear. Taking into consideration the fact that a tractor\r\ntransmission is subjected to the worst possible service conditions,\r\nand that it is under high stress 90 per cent of the time, it seems\r\ninconceivable that any appreciable transmission trouble would be\r\nexperienced when material of this type is used on an automobile,\r\nwhere the full load is applied not over 1 per cent of the time,\r\nor on trucks where the full load is applied not over 50 per cent\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\nThe gear hardness specified is necessary to reduce to a minimum\r\nthe pitting or surface fatigue of the teeth. If gears having a\r\nBrinell hardness of over 560 are used, danger is encountered, due\r\nto low shock-resisting properties. If the Brinell hardness is under\r\n512, trouble is experienced due to wear and surface fatigue of\r\nthe teeth.\r\n\r\nFor ring gears and pinions material of the following chemical\r\ncomposition is recommended: Carbon, 0.100 to 0.200 per cent; manganese,\r\n0.350 to 0.650 per cent; phosphorus, 0.040 maximum per cent; sulphur,\r\n0.045 maximum per cent; chromium, 0.550 to 0.750 per cent; nickel,\r\n0.400 to 0.600 per cent.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to see that this material is properly deoxidized\r\neither by the use of ferrovanadium or its equivalent. The advantage\r\nof using a material of the above type lies in the fact that it will\r\nproduce a satisfactory finished part with a very simple treatment.\r\nThe heat treatment of ring gears and pinions is as follows: \"Carburize\r\nat a temperature of from 1,650 to 1,700°F. for a sufficient length\r\nof time to secure a depth of case of from 1/32 to 3/64 in., and\r\nquench directly from carburizing heat in oil. Reheat to a temperature\r\nof from 1,430 to 1,460°F. and quench in oil. Temper in oil at a\r\ntemperature of from 375 to 425°F. The final quenching operation\r\non a ring gear should be made on a fixture similar to the Gleason\r\npress to reduce distortion to a minimum.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the largest producers of ring gears and pinions in the automotive\r\nindustry has been using this material and treatment for the last 2\r\nyears, and is of the opinion that he is now producing the highest\r\nquality product ever turned out by that plant.\r\n\r\nOn some designs of automobiles a large amount of trouble is experienced\r\nwith the driving pinion. If the material and heat treatment specified\r\nwill not give satisfaction, rather than to change the design it is\r\npossible to use the following analysis material, which will raise\r\nthe cost of the finished part but will give excellent service:\r\nCarbon, 0.100 to 0.200 per cent; manganese, 0.350 to 0.650 per\r\ncent; phosphorus, 0.040 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.045 maximum\r\nper cent; nickel, 4.750 to 5.250 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe heat treatment of pinions produced from this material consists\r\nin carburizing at a temperature of from 1,600 to 1,650°F. for a\r\nsufficient length of time to secure a depth of case from 1/32 to\r\n3/64 in. The pinions are then quenched in oil from a temperature\r\nof 1,500 to 1,525°F. to refine the grain of the core and quenched\r\nin oil from a temperature of from 1,340 to 1,360°F. To refine and\r\nharden the case. The use of this material however, is recommended\r\nonly in an emergency, as high-nickel steel is very susceptible\r\nto seams, secondary pipe and laminations.\r\n\r\nThe main criterion on rear-axle and pinion shafts, steering knuckles\r\nand arms and parts of this general type is resistance to fatigue and\r\ntorsion. The material recommended for parts of this character is\r\neither S. A. E. No. 6135 or No. 3135 steel, which have the chemical\r\ncomposition given in Tables 9 and 7.\r\n\r\nHEAT TREATMENT OF AXLES\r\n\r\nParts of this general type should be heat-treated to show the following\r\nminimum physical properties: Elastic limit, 115,000 lb. per square\r\ninch; elongation in 2 in., 16 per cent; reduction of area, 50 per\r\ncent; Brinell hardness, 277 to 321.\r\n\r\nThe heat treatment used to secure these physical properties consists\r\nin quenching from a temperature of from 1,520 to 1,540°F. in water\r\nand tempering at a temperature of from 975 to 1,025°F. Where the\r\naxle shaft is a forging, and in the case of steering knuckles and\r\narms, this heat treatment should be preceded by normalizing the\r\nforgings at a temperature of from 1,550 to 1,600°F. It will be\r\nnoted that these physical properties correspond to those worked\r\nout for an ideal aviation engine crankshaft. If parts of this type\r\nare designed with proper sections, so that this range of physical\r\nproperties can be used, the part in question will give maximum\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important developments during the Liberty engine\r\nprogram was the fact that it is not necessary to use a high-analysis\r\nalloy steel to secure a finished part which will give proper service.\r\nThis fact should save the automotive industry millions of dollars\r\non future production.\r\n\r\nIf the proper authority be given the metallurgical engineer to\r\ngovern the handling of the steel from the time it is purchased\r\nuntil it is assembled into finished product, mild-analysis steels\r\ncan be used and the quality of the finished product guaranteed.\r\nIt was only through the careful adherence to these fundamental\r\nprinciples that it was possible to produce 20,000 Liberty engines,\r\nwhich are considered to be the most highly stressed mechanism ever\r\nproduced, without the failure of a single engine from defective\r\nmaterial or heat treatment.\r\n\r\nMAKING STEEL BALLS\r\n\r\nSteel balls are made from rods or coils according to size, stock\r\nless than 9/16-in. comes in coils. Stock 5/8-in. and larger comes\r\nin rods. Ball stock is designated in thousandths so that 5/8-in.\r\nrods are known as 0.625-in. stock.\r\n\r\nSteel for making balls of average size is made up of:\r\n\r\n  Carbon                         0.95 to 1.05 per cent\r\n  Silicon                        0.20 to 0.35 per cent\r\n  Manganese                      0.30 to 0.45 per cent\r\n  Chromium                       0.35 to 0.45 per cent\r\n  Sulphur and phosphorus not to exceed  0.025 per cent\r\n\r\nFor the larger sizes a typical analysis is:\r\n\r\n  Carbon        1.02  per cent\r\n  Silicon       0.21  per cent\r\n  Manganese     0.40  per cent\r\n  Chromium      0.65  per cent\r\n  Sulphur       0.026 per cent\r\n  Phosphorus    0.014 per cent\r\n\r\nBalls 5/8 in. and below are formed cold on upsetting or heading\r\nmachines, the stock use is as follows:\r\n\r\n TABLE 14.--SIZES OF STOCK FOR FORMING BALLS ON HEADER\r\n -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Diameter of | Diameter of | Diameter of | Diameter of\r\n  ball, inch  | stock inch  | ball, inch  | stock, inch\r\n -------------|-------------|-------------|-------------\r\n      1/8     |    0.100    |     5/16    |    0.235\r\n      5/32    |    0.120    |     3/8     |    0.275\r\n      3/16    |    0.145    |     7/16    |    0.320\r\n      7/32    |    0.170    |     1/2     |    0.365\r\n      1/4     |    0.190    |     9/16    |    0.395\r\n      9/32    |    0.220    |     5/8     |    0.440\r\n -------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor larger balls the blanks are hot-forged from straight bars.\r\nThey are usually forged in multiples of four under a spring hammer\r\nand then separated by a suitable punching or shearing die in a\r\npress adjoining the hammer. The dimensions are:\r\n\r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Diameter of ball, | Diameter of die, | Diameter of stock,\r\n        inch        |       inch       |       inch\r\n -------------------|------------------|--------------------\r\n         3/4        |      0.775       |       0.625\r\n         7/8        |      0.905       |       0.729\r\n          1         |      1.035       |       0.823\r\n -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBefore hardening, the balls are annealed to relieve the stresses\r\nof forging and grinding, this being done by passing them through a\r\nrevolving retort made of nichrome or other heat-resisting substance.\r\nThe annealing temperature is 1,300°F.\r\n\r\nThe hardening temperature is from 1,425 to 1,475°F. according to\r\nsize and composition of steel. Small balls, 5/16 and under, are\r\nquenched in oil, the larger sizes in water. In some special cases\r\nbrine is used. Quenching small balls in water is too great a shock\r\nas the small volume is cooled clear through almost instantly. The\r\nlarger balls have metal enough to cool more slowly.\r\n\r\nBalls which are cooled in either water or brine are boiled in water\r\nfor 2 hr. to relieve internal stresses, after which the balls are\r\nfinished by dry-grinding and oil-grinding.\r\n\r\nThe ball makers have an interesting method of testing stock for\r\nseams which do not show in the rod or wire. The Hoover Steel Ball\r\nCompany cut off pieces of rod or wire 7/16 in. long and subject\r\nthem to an end pressure of from 20,000 to 50,000 lb. A pressure\r\nof 20,000 lb. compresses the piece to 3/16 in. and the 50,000 lb.\r\npressure to 3/32 in. This opens any seam which may exist but a\r\nsolid bar shows no seam.\r\n\r\nAnother method which has proved very successful is to pass the\r\nbar or rod to be tested through a solenoid electro-magnet. With\r\nsuitable instruments it is claimed that this is an almost infallible\r\ntest as the instruments show at once when a seam or flaw is present\r\nin the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FORGING OF STEEL\r\n\r\nSo much depends upon the forging of steel that this operation must\r\nbe carefully supervised. This is especially true because of the\r\ntendency to place unskilled and ignorant men as furnace-tenders\r\nand hammer men. The main points to be supervised are the slow and\r\ncareful heating to the proper temperature; forging must be continued\r\nat a proper rate to the correct temperature. The bar of stock from\r\nwhich a forging was made may have had a fairly good structure, but\r\nif the details of the working are not carefully watched, a seamy,\r\nsplit article of no value may easily result.\r\n\r\nHEATING.--Although it is possible to work steels cold, to an extent\r\ndepending upon their ductility, and although such operations are\r\ncommonly performed, \"forging\" usually means working _heated_ steel.\r\n_Heating_ is therefore a vital part of the process.\r\n\r\nHeating should be done slowly in a soaking heat. A soft \"lazy\"\r\nflame with excess carbon is necessary to avoid burning the corners\r\nof the bar or billet, and heavily scaling the surface. If the\r\ntemperature is not raised slowly, the outer part of the metal may\r\nbe at welding heat while the inner part is several hundred degrees\r\ncolder and comparatively hard and brittle.\r\n\r\nThe above refers to muffle furnaces. If the heating is done in\r\na small blacksmith's forge, the fire should be kept clean, and\r\nremade at intervals of about two hours. Ashes and cinders should\r\nbe cleaned from the center down to the tuyere and oily waste and\r\nwood used to start a new fire. As this kindles a layer of coke\r\nfrom the old fire is put on top, and another layer of green coal\r\n(screened and dampened blacksmiths' coal) as a cover. When the\r\ngreen coal on top has been coked the fire is ready for use. As\r\nthe fuel burns out in the center, the coke forming around the edge\r\nis pushed inward, and its place taken by more green coal. Thus the\r\nfire is made up of three parts; the center where coke is burning\r\nand the iron heating; a zone where coke is forming, and the outside\r\nbank of green coal.\r\n\r\nSTEEL WORKED IN AUSTENITIC STATE.--As a general rule steel should\r\nbe worked when it is in the austenitic state. (See page 108.) It\r\nis then soft and ductile.\r\n\r\nAs the steel is heated above the critical temperature the size of\r\nthe austenite crystals tends to grow rapidly. When forging starts,\r\nhowever, these grains are broken up. The growth is continually\r\ndestroyed by the hammering, which should consequently be continued\r\ndown to the upper critical temperature when the austenite crystals\r\nbreak up into ferrite and cementite. The size of the final grains\r\nwill be much smaller and hence a more uniform structure will result\r\nif the \"mother\" austenite was also fine grained. A final steel\r\nwill be composed of pearlite; ferrite and pearlite; or cementite\r\nand pearlite, according to the carbon content.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate object is to secure a fine, uniform grain throughout\r\nthe piece and this can be secured by uniform heating and by thoroughly\r\nrolling it or working it at a temperature just down to its critical\r\npoint. If this is correctly done the fracture will be fine and\r\nsilky. Steel which has been overheated slightly and the forging\r\nstopped at too high a temperature will show a \"granular\" fracture.\r\nA badly overheated or \"burned\" steel will have iridescent colors\r\non a fresh fracture, it will be brittle both hot and cold, and\r\nabsolutely ruined.\r\n\r\nSTEEL CAN BE WORKED COLD.--As noted above, steel can be worked cold,\r\nas in the case of cold-rolled steel. Heat treatment of cold-worked\r\nsteel is a very delicate operation. Cold working hardens and strengthens\r\nsteel. It also introduces internal stresses. Heat-treatments are\r\ndesigned to eliminate the stresses without losing the hardness\r\nand strength. This is done by tempering at a low heat. Avoid the\r\n\"blue\" range (350 to 750°C.). Tempering for a considerable time just\r\nunder the critical is liable to cause great brittleness. Annealing\r\n(reheating through the critical) destroys the effect of cold work.\r\n\r\nFORGING\r\n\r\nHIGH-SPEED STEEL.--Heat very slowly and carefully to from 1,800\r\nto 2,000°F. and forge thoroughly and uniformly. If the forging\r\noperation is prolonged do not continue forging the tool when the\r\nsteel begins to stiffen under the hammer. Do not forge below 1,700°F.\r\n(a dark lemon or orange color). Reheat frequently rather than prolong\r\nthe hammering at the low heats.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the forging allow the tool to cool as slowly as\r\npossible in lime or dry ashes; avoid placing the tool on the damp\r\nground or in a draught of air. Use a good clean fire for heating.\r\nDo not allow the tool to soak at the forging heat. Do not heat any\r\nmore of the tool than is necessary in order to forge it to the\r\ndesired shape.\r\n\r\nCARBON TOOL STEEL.--Heat to a bright red, about 1,500 to 1,550°F.\r\nDo not hammer steel when it cools down to a dark cherry red, or\r\njust below its hardening point, as this creates surface cracks.\r\n\r\nOIL-HARDENING STEEL.--Heat slowly and uniformly to 1,450°F. and\r\nforge thoroughly. Do not under any circumstances attempt to harden\r\nat the forging heat. After cooling from forging reheat to about\r\n1,450°F. and cool slowly so as to remove forging strains.\r\n\r\nCHROME-NICKEL STEEL.--Forging heat of chrome-nickel steel depends\r\nvery largely on the percentage of each element contained in the\r\nsteel. Steel containing from 1/2 to 1 per cent chromium and from\r\n1-1/2 to 3-1/2 per cent nickel, with a carbon content equal to\r\nthe chromium, should be heated very slowly and uniformly to\r\napproximately 1,600° F., or salmon color. After forging, reheat\r\nthe steel to about 1,450° and cool slowly so as to remove forging\r\nstrains. Do not attempt to harden the steel before such annealing.\r\n\r\nA great deal of steel is constantly being spoiled by carelessness\r\nin the forging operation. The billets may be perfectly sound, but\r\neven if the steel is heated to a good forging heat, and is hammered\r\ntoo lightly, a poor forging results. A proper blow will cause the\r\nedges and ends to bulge slightly outwards--the inner-most parts\r\nof the steel seem to flow faster than the surface. Light blows\r\nwill work the surface out faster; the edges and ends will curve\r\ninwards. This condition in extreme cases leaves a seam in the axis\r\nof the forging.\r\n\r\nSteel which is heated quickly and forging begun before uniform\r\nheat has penetrated to its center will open up seams because the\r\ncooler central portion is not able to flow with the hot metal\r\nsurrounding it. Uniform heating is absolutely necessary for the\r\nbest results.\r\n\r\nFigure 16 shows a sound forging. The bars in Fig. 17 were burst\r\nby improper forging, while the die, Fig. 18, burst from a piped\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nFigure 19 shows a piece forged with a hammer too light for the size\r\nof the work. This gives an appearance similar to case-hardening,\r\nthe refining effect of the blows reaching but a short distance\r\nfrom the surface.\r\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to accurately rate the capacity of steam\r\nhammers with respect to the size of work they should handle, on\r\naccount of the greatly varying conditions, a few notes from the\r\nexperience of the Bement works of the Niles-Bement-Pond Company\r\nwill be of service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--A sound forging.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Burst from improper forging.]\r\n\r\nFor making an occasional forging of a given size, a smaller hammer\r\nmay be used than if we are manufacturing this same piece in large\r\nquantities. If we have a 6-in. piece to forge, such as a pinion or\r\na short shaft, a hammer of about 1,100-lb. capacity would answer\r\nvery nicely. But should the general work be as large as this, it\r\nwould be very much better to use a 1,500-lb. hammer. If, on the\r\nother hand, we wish to forge 6-in. axles economically, it would\r\nbe necessary to use a 7,000- or 8,000-lb. hammer. The following\r\ntable will be found convenient for reference for the proper size\r\nof hammer to be used on different classes of general blacksmith\r\nwork, although it will be understood that it is necessary to modify\r\nthese to suit conditions, as has already been indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Burst from a piped center.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Result of using too light a hammer.]\r\n\r\n  Diameter of stock    Size of hammer\r\n  3-1/2 in.             250 to   350 lb.\r\n  4     in.             350 to   600 lb.\r\n  4-1/2 in.             600 to   800 lb.\r\n  5     in.             800 to 1,000 lb.\r\n  6     in.           1,100 to 1,500 lb.\r\n\r\nSteam hammers are always rated by the weight of the ram, and the\r\nattached parts, which include the piston and rod, nothing being\r\nadded on account of the steam pressure behind the piston. This makes\r\nit a little difficult to compare them with plain drop or tilting\r\nhammers, which are also rated in the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Good and bad ingots.]\r\n\r\nSteam hammers are usually operated at pressures varying from 75\r\nto 100 lb. of steam per square inch, and may also be operated by\r\ncompressed air at about the same pressures. It is cheaper, however,\r\nin the case of compressed air to use pressures from 60 to 80 lb.\r\ninstead of going higher.\r\n\r\nForgings must, however, be made from sound billets if satisfactory\r\nresults are to be secured. Figure 20 shows three cross-sections\r\nof which _A_ is sound, _B_ is badly piped and _C_ is worthless.\r\n\r\nPLANT FOR FORGING RIFLE BARRELS\r\n\r\nThe forging of rifle barrels in large quantities and heat-treating\r\nthem to meet the specifications demanded by some of the foreign\r\ngovernments led Wheelock, Lovejoy & Company to establish a complete\r\nplant for this purpose in connection with their warehouse in Cambridge,\r\nMass. This plant, designed and constructed by their chief engineer,\r\nK. A. Juthe, had many interesting features. Many features of this\r\nplant can be modified for other classes of work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 21.--Cutting up barrels.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Upsetting the ends.]\r\n\r\nThe stock, which came in bars of mill length, was cut off so as to\r\nmake a barrel with the proper allowances for trimming (Fig. 21).\r\nThey then pass to the forging or upsetting press in the adjoining\r\nroom. This press, which is shown in more detail in Fig. 22, handled\r\nthe barrels from all the heating furnaces shown. The men changed\r\nwork at frequent intervals, to avoid excessive fatigue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Continuous heating furnace.]\r\n\r\nThen the barrels were reheated in the continuous furnace, shown\r\nin Fig. 23, and straightened before being tested.\r\n\r\nThe barrels were next tested for straightness. After the heat-treating,\r\nthe ends are ground, a spot ground on the enlarged end and each\r\nbarrel tested on a Brinell machine. The pressure used is 3,000 kg.,\r\nor 6,614 lb., on a 10-millimeter ball, which is standard. Hardness\r\nof 240 was desired.\r\n\r\nThe heat-treating of the rifle blanks covered four separate operations:\r\n(1) Heating and soaking the steel above the critical temperature\r\nand quenching in oil to harden the steel through to the center;\r\n(2) reheating for drawing of temper for the purpose of meeting the\r\nphysical specifications; (3) reheating to meet the machine ability\r\ntest for production purposes; and (4) reheating to straighten the\r\nblanks while hot.\r\n\r\nA short explanation of the necessity for the many heats may be\r\ninteresting. For the first heat, the blanks were slowly brought\r\nto the required heat, which is about 150°F. above the critical\r\ntemperature. They are then soaked at a high heat for about 1 hr.\r\nbefore quenching. The purpose of this treatment is to eliminate\r\nany rolling or heat stresses that might be in the bars from mill\r\noperations; also to insure a thorough even heat through a cross-section\r\nof the steel. This heat also causes blanks with seams or slight\r\nflaws to open up in quenching, making detection of defective blanks\r\nvery easy.\r\n\r\nThe quenching oil was kept at a constant temperature of 100°F.,\r\nto avoid subjecting the steel to shocks, thereby causing surface\r\ncracks. The drawing of temper was the most critical operation and\r\nwas kept within a 10° fluctuation. The degree of heat necessary\r\ndepends entirely on the analysis of the steel, there being a certain\r\nvariation in the different heats of steel as received from the mill.\r\n\r\nMACHINEABILITY\r\n\r\nReheating for machine ability was done at 100° less than the drawing\r\ntemperature, but the time of soaking is more than double. After\r\nboth drawing and reheating, the blanks were buried in lime where\r\nthey remain, out of contact with the air, until their temperature\r\nhad dropped to that of the workroom.\r\n\r\nFor straightening, the barrels were heated to from 900 to 1,000°F.\r\nin an automatic furnace 25 ft. long, this operation taking about 2\r\nhr. The purpose of hot straightening was to prevent any stresses\r\nbeing put into the blanks, so that after rough-turning, drilling\r\nor rifling operations they would not have a tendency to spring\r\nback to shape as left by the quenching bath.\r\n\r\nA method that produces an even better machining rifle blank, which\r\npractically stays straight through the different machining operations,\r\nwas to rough-turn the blanks, then subject them to a heat of practically\r\n1,0000 for 4 hr. Production throughout the different operations is\r\nmaterially increased, with practically no straightening required\r\nafter drilling, reaming, finish-turning or rifling operations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. FIG. 25.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 24 and 25.--Roof system of cooling quenching oil.]\r\n\r\nThis method was tested out by one of the largest manufacturers and\r\nproved to be the best way to eliminate a very expensive finished\r\ngun-barrel straightening process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Details of the cooler.]\r\n\r\nThe heat-treating required a large amount of cooling oil, and the\r\nproblem of keeping this at the proper temperature required considerable\r\nstudy. The result was the cooling plant on the roof, as shown in\r\nFigs. 24, 25 and 26. The first two illustrations show the plant as\r\nit appeared complete. Figure 26 shows how the oil was handled in\r\nwhat is sometimes called the ebulator system. The oil was pumped\r\nup from the cooling tanks through the pipe _A_ to the tank _B_.\r\nFrom here it ran down onto the breakers or separators _C_, which\r\nbreak the oil up into fine particles that are caught by the fans\r\n_D_. The spray is blown up into the cooling tower _E_, which contains\r\nbanks of cooling pipes, as can be seen, as well as baffies _F_. The\r\nspray collects on the cool pipes and forms drops, which fall on\r\nthe curved plates _G_ and run back to the oil-storage tank below\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe water for this cooling was pumped from 10 artesian wells at the\r\nrate of 60 gal. per minute and cooled 90 gal. of oil per minute,\r\nlowering the temperature from 130 or 140 to 100°F. The water as\r\nit came from the wells averaged around 52°F. The motor was of a\r\n7-1/2-hp. variable-speed type with a range of from 700 to 1,200\r\nr.p.m., which could be varied to suit the amount of oil to be cooled.\r\nThe plant handled 300 gal. of oil per minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nANNEALING\r\n\r\nThere is no mystery or secret about the proper annealing of different\r\nsteels, but in order to secure the best results it is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the operator to know the kind of steel which is to\r\nbe annealed. The annealing of steel is primarily done for one of\r\nthree specific purposes: To soften for machining purposes; to change\r\nthe physical properties, largely to increase ductility; or to release\r\nstrains caused by rolling or forging.\r\n\r\nProper annealing means the heating of the steel slowly and uniformly\r\nto the right temperature, the holding of the temperature for a given\r\nperiod and the gradual cooling to normal temperature. The proper\r\ntemperature depends on the kind of steel, and the suggestions of the\r\nmaker of the special steel being used should be carefully followed.\r\nFor carbon steel the temperatures recommended for annealing vary\r\nfrom 1,450 to 1,600°F. This temperature need not be long continued.\r\nThe steel should be cooled in hot sand, lime or ashes. If heated in\r\nthe open forge the steel should be buried in the cooling material\r\nas quickly as possible, not allowing it to remain in the open air\r\nany longer than absolutely necessary. Best results, however, are\r\nsecured when the fire does not come in direct contact with the\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nGood results are obtained by packing the steel in iron boxes or\r\ntubes, much as for case-hardening or carbonizing, using the same\r\nmaterials. Pieces do not require to be entirely surrounded by carbon\r\nfor annealing, however. Do not remove from boxes until cold.\r\n\r\nSteel to be annealed may be classified into four different groups,\r\neach of which must be treated according to the elements contained in\r\nits particular analysis. Different methods are therefore necessary\r\nto bring about the desired result. The classifications are as follows:\r\nHigh-speed steel, alloy steel, tool or crucible steel, and high-carbon\r\nmachinery steel.\r\n\r\nANNEALING OF HIGH-SPEED STEEL\r\n\r\nFor annealing high-speed steel, some makers recommend using ground\r\nmica, charcoal, lime, fine dry ashes or lake sand as a packing\r\nin the annealing boxes. Mixtures of one part charcoal, one part\r\nlime and three parts of sand are also suggested, or two parts of\r\nashes may be substituted for the one part of lime.\r\n\r\nTo bring about the softest structure or machine ability of high-speed\r\nsteel, it should be packed in charcoal in boxes or pipes, carefully\r\nsealed at all points, so that no gases will escape or air be admitted.\r\nIt should be heated slowly to not less than 1,450°F. and the steel\r\nmust not be removed from its packing until it is cool. Slow heating\r\nmeans that the high heat must have penetrated to the very core of\r\nthe steel.\r\n\r\nWhen the steel is heated clear through it has been in the furnace\r\nlong enough. If the steel can remain in the furnace and cool down\r\nwith it, there will be no danger of air blasts or sudden or uneven\r\ncooling. If not, remove the box and cover quickly with dry ashes,\r\nsand or lime until it becomes cold.\r\n\r\nToo high a heat or maintaining the heat for too long a period,\r\nproduces a harsh, coarse grain and greatly increases the liability\r\nto crack in hardening. It also reduces the strength and toughness\r\nof the steel.\r\n\r\nSteel which is to be used for making tools with teeth, such as\r\ntaps, reamers and milling cutters, should not be annealed too much.\r\nWhen the steel is too soft it is more apt to tear in cutting and\r\nmakes it more difficult to cut a smooth thread or other surface.\r\nModerate annealing is found best for tools of this kind.\r\n\r\nTOOL OR CRUCIBLE STEEL\r\n\r\nCrucible steel can be annealed either in muffled furnace or by\r\nbeing packed. Packing is by far the most satisfactory method as it\r\nprevents scaling, local hard spots, uneven annealing, or violent\r\nchanges in shape. It should be brought up slowly to just above\r\nits calescent or hardening temperature. The operator must know\r\nbefore setting his heats the temperature at which the different\r\ncarbon content steels are hardened. The higher the carbon contents\r\nthe lower is the hardening heat, but this should in no case be\r\nless than 1,450°F.\r\n\r\nANNEALING ALLOY STEEL\r\n\r\nThe term alloy steel, from the steel maker's point of view, refers\r\nlargely to nickel and chromium steel or a combination of both. These\r\nsteels are manufactured very largely by the open-hearth process,\r\nalthough chromium steels are also a crucible product. It is next\r\nto impossible to give proper directions for the proper annealing\r\nof alloy steel unless the composition is known to the operator.\r\n\r\nNickel steels may be annealed at lower temperatures than carbon\r\nsteels, depending upon their alloy content. For instance, if a\r\npearlitic carbon steel may be annealed at 1,450°C., the same analysis\r\ncontaining 2-1/2 per cent nickel may be annealed at 1,360°C. and\r\na 5 per cent nickel steel at 1,270°.\r\n\r\nIn order that high chromium steels may be readily machined, they\r\nmust be heated at or slightly above the critical for a very long\r\ntime, and cooled through the critical at an extremely slow rate.\r\nFor a steel containing 0.9 to 1.1 per cent carbon, under 0.50 per\r\ncent manganese, and about 1.0 per cent chromium, Bullens recommends\r\nthe following anneal:\r\n\r\n  1. Heat to 1,700 or 1,750°F.\r\n  2. Air cool to about 800°F.\r\n  3. Soak at 1,425 to 1,450°F.\r\n  4. Cool slowly in furnace.\r\n\r\nHIGH-CARBON MACHINERY STEEL\r\n\r\nThe carbon content of this steel is above 30 points and is hardly\r\never above 60 points or 0.60 per cent. Annealing such steel is\r\ngenerally in quantity production and does not require the care that\r\nthe other steels need because it is very largely a much cheaper\r\nproduct and a great deal of material is generally removed from\r\nthe outside surface.\r\n\r\nThe purpose for which this steel is annealed is a deciding factor\r\nas to what heat to give it. If it is for machineability only, the\r\nsteel requires to be brought up slowly to just below the critical and\r\nthen slowly cooled in the furnace or ash pit. It must be thoroughly\r\ncovered so that there will be no access of cool air. If the annealing\r\nis to increase ductility to the maximum extent it should be slowly\r\nheated to slightly over the upper critical temperature and kept at\r\nthis heat for a length of time necessary for a thorough penetration\r\nto the core, after which it can be cooled to about 1,200°F., then\r\nreheated to about 1,360°F., when it can be removed and put in an\r\nash pit or covered with lime. If the annealing is just to relieve\r\nstrains, slow heating is not necessary, but the steel must be brought\r\nup to a temperature not much less than a forging or rolling heat\r\nand gradually cooled. Covering in this case is only necessary in\r\nsteel of a carbon content of more than 40 points.\r\n\r\nANNEALING IN BONE\r\n\r\nSteel and cast iron may both be annealed in granulated bone. Pack the\r\nwork the same as for case-hardening except that it is not necessary\r\nto keep the pieces away from each other. Pack with bone that has\r\nbeen used until it is nearly white. Heat as hot as necessary for\r\nthe steel and let the furnace cool down. If the boxes are removed\r\nfrom furnace while still warm, cover boxes and all in warm ashes\r\nor sand, air slaked lime or old, burned bone to retain heat as\r\nlong as possible. Do not remove work from boxes until cold.\r\n\r\nANNEALING OF RIFLE COMPONENTS AT SPRINGFIELD ARMORY\r\n\r\nIn general, all forgings of the components of the arms manufactured\r\nat the Armory and all forgings for other ordnance establishments\r\nare packed in charcoal, lime or suitable material and annealed\r\nbefore being transferred from the forge shop.\r\n\r\nExcept in special cases, all annealing will be done in annealing\r\npots of appropriate size. One fire end of a thermo-couple is inserted\r\nin the center of the annealing pot nearest the middle of the furnace\r\nand another in the furnace outside of but near the annealing pots.\r\n\r\nThe temperatures used in annealing carbon steel components of the\r\nvarious classes used at the Armory vary from 800°C. To 880°C. or\r\n1,475 to 1,615°F.\r\n\r\nThe fuel is shut off from the annealing furnace gradually as the\r\ntemperature of the pot approaches the prescribed annealing temperature\r\nso as to prevent heating beyond that temperature.\r\n\r\nThe forgings of the rifle barrel and the pistol barrel are exceptions\r\nto the above general rule. These forgings will be packed in lime\r\nand allowed to cool slowly from the residual heat after forging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCASE-HARDENING OR SURFACE-CARBURIZING\r\n\r\nCarburizing, commonly called case-hardening, is the art of producing\r\na high-carbon surface, or case, upon a low carbon steel article.\r\nWrenches, locomotive link motions, gun mechanisms, balls and ball\r\nraces, automobile gears and many other devices are thereby given\r\na high-carbon _case_ capable of assuming extreme hardness, while\r\nthe interior body of metal, the _core_, remains soft and tough.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method is to heat the piece to be hardened to a bright\r\nred, dip it in cyanide of potassium (or cover it by sprinkling\r\nthe cyanide over it), keep it hot until the melted cyanide covers\r\nit thoroughly, and quench in water. Carbon and nitrogen enter the\r\nouter skin of the steel and harden this skin but leave the center\r\nsoft. The hard surface or \"case\" varies in thickness according to\r\nthe size of the piece, the materials used and the length of time\r\nwhich the piece remains at the carburizing temperature. Cyanide\r\ncase-hardening is used only where a light or thin skin is sufficient.\r\nIt gives a thickness of about 0.002 in.\r\n\r\nIn some cases of cyanide carburizing, the piece is heated in cyanide\r\nto the desired temperature and then quenched. For a thicker case\r\nthe steel is packed in carbon materials of various kinds such as\r\nburnt leather scraps, charcoal, granulated bone or some of the\r\nmany carbonizing compounds.\r\n\r\nMachined or forged steel parts are packed with case-hardening material\r\nin metal boxes and subjected to a red heat. Under such conditions,\r\ncarbon is absorbed by the steel surfaces, and a carburized case is\r\nproduced capable of responding to ordinary hardening and tempering\r\noperations, the core meanwhile retaining its original softness and\r\ntoughness.\r\n\r\nSuch case-hardened parts are stronger, cheaper, and more serviceable\r\nthan similar parts made of tool steel. The tough core resists breakage\r\nby shock. The hardened case resists wear from friction. The low cost\r\nof material, the ease of manufacture, and the lessened breakage\r\nin quenching all serve to promote cheap production.\r\n\r\nFor successful carburizing, the following points should be carefully\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\nThe utmost care should be used in the selection of pots for carburizing;\r\nthey should be as free as possible from both scaling and warping.\r\nThese two requirements eliminate the cast iron pot, although many\r\nare used, thus leaving us to select from malleable castings, wrought\r\niron, cast steel, and special alloys, such as nichrome or silchrome.\r\nIf first cost is not important, it will prove cheaper in the end\r\nto use pots of some special alloy.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: FIGS. 27 to 30.--Case-hardening or carburizing boxes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--A lid that is easily luted.]\r\n\r\nThe pots should be standardized to suit the product. Pots should be\r\nmade as small as possible in width, and space gained by increasing\r\nthe height; for it takes about 1-1/2 hr. to heat the average small\r\npot of 4 in. in width, between 3 and 4 hr. to heat to the center\r\nof an 8-in. box, and 5 to 6 hr. to heat to the center of a 12-in.\r\nbox; and the longer the time required to heat to the center, the\r\nmore uneven the carburizing.\r\n\r\nThe work is packed in the box surrounded by materials which will\r\ngive up carbon when heated. It must be packed so that each piece\r\nis separate from the others and does not touch the box, with a\r\nsufficient amount of carburizing material surrounding each. Figures\r\n27 to 31 show the kind of boxes used and the way the work should be\r\npacked. Figure 31 shows a later type of box in which the edges can\r\nbe easily luted. Figure 30 shows test wires broken periodically to\r\ndetermine the depth of case. Figure 28 shows the minimum clearance\r\nwhich should be used in packing and Fig. 29 the way in which the\r\nouter pieces receive the heat first and likewise take up the carbon\r\nbefore those in the center. This is why a slow, soaking heat is\r\nnecessary in handling large quantities of work, so as to allow\r\nthe heat and carbon to soak in equally.\r\n\r\nWhile it has been claimed that iron below its critical temperature\r\nwill absorb some carbon, Giolitti has shown that this absorption\r\nis very slow. In order to produce quick and intense carburization\r\nthe iron should preferably be above its upper critical temperature\r\nor 1,600°F.,--therefore the carbon absorbed immediately goes into\r\naustenite, or solid solution. It is also certain that the higher\r\nthe temperature the quicker will carbon be absorbed, and the deeper\r\nit will penetrate into the steel, that is, the deeper the \"case.\"\r\nAt Sheffield, England, where wrought iron is packed in charcoal and\r\nheated for days to convert it into \"blister steel,\" the temperatures\r\nare from 1,750 to 1,830°F. Charcoal by itself carburizes slowly,\r\nconsequently commercial compounds also contain certain \"energizers\"\r\nwhich give rapid penetration at lower temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing in carburizing is the human element. Most\r\ncareful vigilance should be kept when packing and unpacking, and the\r\noperator should be instructed in the necessity for clean compound\r\nfree from scale, moisture, fire clay, sand, floor sweepings, etc.\r\nFrom just such causes, many a good carburizer has been unjustly\r\ncondemned. It is essential with most carburizers to use about 25 to\r\n50 per cent of used material, in order to prevent undue shrinking\r\nduring heating; therefore the necessity of properly screening used\r\nmaterial and carefully inspecting it for foreign substances before\r\nit is used again. It is right here that the greatest carelessness\r\nis generally encountered.\r\n\r\nDon't pack the work to be carburized too closely; leave at least\r\n1 in. from the bottom, 3/4 in. from the sides, and 1 in. from the\r\ntop of pots, and for a 6-hr. run, have the pieces at least 1/2\r\nin. apart. This gives the heat a chance to thoroughly permeate\r\nthe pot, and the carburizing material a chance to shrink without\r\nallowing carburized pieces to touch and cause soft spots.\r\n\r\nGood case-hardening pots and annealing tubes can be made from the\r\ndesired size of wrought iron pipe. The ends are capped or welded,\r\nand a slot is cut in the side of the pot, equal to one quarter of\r\nits circumference, and about 7/8 of its length. Another piece of\r\nthe same diameter pipe cut lengthwise into thirds forms a cover\r\nfor this pot. We then have a cheap, substantial pot, non-warping,\r\nwith a minimum tendency to scale, but the pot is difficult to seal\r\ntightly. This idea is especially adaptable when long, narrow pots\r\nare desired.\r\n\r\nWhen pots are packed and the carburizer thoroughly tamped down,\r\nthe covers of the pot are put on and sealed with fire clay which\r\nhas a little salt mixed into it. The more perfect the seal the\r\nmore we can get out of the carburizer. The rates of penetration\r\ndepend on temperature and the presence of proper gas in the required\r\nvolume. Any pressure we can cause will, of course, have a tendency\r\nto increase the rate of penetration.\r\n\r\nIf you have a wide furnace, do not load it full at one time. Put\r\none-half your load in first, in the center of the furnace, and\r\nheat until pots show a low red, about 1,325 to 1,350°F. Then fill\r\nthe furnace by putting the cold pots on the outside or, the section\r\nnearest the source of heat. This will give the work in the slowest\r\nportion of the furnace a chance to come to heat at the same time\r\nas the pots that are nearest the sources of heat.\r\n\r\nTo obtain an even heating of the pots and lessen their tendency\r\nto warp and scale, and to cause the contents of the furnace to\r\nheat up evenly, we should use a reducing fire and fill the heating\r\nchamber with flame. This can be accomplished by partially closing\r\nthe waste gas vents and reducing slightly the amount of air used\r\nby the burners. A short flame will then be noticed issuing from\r\nthe partially closed vents. Thus, while maintaining the temperature\r\nof the heating chamber, we will have a lower temperature in the\r\ncombustion chamber, which will naturally increase its longevity.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is advisable to cool the work in the pots. This saves\r\ncompound, and causes a more gradual diffusion of the carbon between\r\nthe case and the core, and is very desirable condition, inasmuch\r\nas abrupt cases are inclined to chip out.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory steel to carburize contains between 0.10\r\nand 0.20 per cent carbon, less than 0.35 per cent manganese, less\r\nthan 0.04 per cent phosphorus and sulphur, and low silicon. But\r\nsteel of this composition does not seem to satisfy our progressive\r\nengineers, and many alloy steels are now on the market, these,\r\nalthough more or less difficult to machine, give when carburized\r\nthe various qualities demanded, such as a very hard case, very tough\r\ncore, or very hard case and tough core. However, the additional\r\nelements also have a great effect both on the rate of penetration\r\nduring the carburizing operation, and on the final treatment,\r\nconsequently such alloy steels require very careful supervision\r\nduring the entire heat treating operations.\r\n\r\nRATE OF ABSORPTION\r\n\r\nAccording to Guillet, the absorption of carbon is favored by those\r\nspecial elements which exist as double carbides in steel. For example,\r\nmanganese exists as manganese carbide in combination with the iron\r\ncarbide. The elements that favor the absorption of carbon are:\r\nmanganese, tungsten, chromium and molybdenum those opposing it,\r\nnickel, silicon, and aluminum. Guillet has worked out the effect\r\nof the different elements on the rate of penetration in comparison\r\nwith steel that absorbed carbon at a given temperature, at an average\r\nrate of 0.035 in. per hour.\r\n\r\nHis tables show that the following elements require an increased\r\ntime of exposure to the carburizing material in order to obtain\r\nthe same depth of penetration as with simple steel:\r\n\r\n   When steel contains    Increased time of exposure\r\n  2.0 per cent nickel            28 per cent\r\n  7.0 per cent nickel            30 per cent\r\n  1.0 per cent titanium          12 per cent\r\n  2.0 per cent titanium          28 per cent\r\n  0.5 per cent silicon           50 per cent\r\n  1.0 per cent silicon           80 per cent\r\n  2.0 per cent silicon          122 per cent\r\n  5.0 per cent silicon         No penetration\r\n  1.0 per cent aluminum         122 per cent\r\n  2.0 per cent aluminum         350 per cent\r\n\r\nThe following elements seem to assist the rate of penetration of\r\ncarbon, and the carburizing time may therefore be reduced as follows:\r\n\r\n   When steel contains      Decreased time of exposure\r\n  0.5 per cent manganese           18 per cent\r\n  1.0 per cent manganese           25 per cent\r\n  1.0 per cent chromium            10 per cent\r\n  2.0 per cent chromium            18 per cent\r\n  0.5 per cent tungsten             0\r\n  1.0 per cent tungsten             0\r\n  2.0 per cent tungsten            25 per cent\r\n  1.0 per cent molybdenum           0\r\n  2.0 per cent molybdenum          18 per cent\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which carburization is accomplished is a very\r\nimportant factor. Hence the necessity for a reliable pyrometer,\r\nlocated so as to give the temperature just below the tops of the\r\npots. It must be remembered, however, that the pyrometer gives\r\nthe temperature of only one spot, and is therefore only an aid to\r\nthe operator, who must use his eyes for successful results.\r\n\r\nThe carbon content of the case generally is governed by the temperature\r\nof the carburization. It generally proves advisable to have the\r\ncase contain between 0.90 per cent and 1.10 carbon; more carbon\r\nthan this gives rise to excess free cementite or carbide of iron,\r\nwhich is detrimental, causing the case to be brittle and apt to chip.\r\n\r\nT. G. Selleck gives a very useful table of temperatures and the\r\nrelative carbon contents of the case of steels carburized between\r\n4 and 6 hrs. using a good charcoal carburizer. This data is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   TABLE 15.--CARBON CONTENT OBTAINED AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES\r\n\r\n  At 1,500°F., the surface carbon content will be 0.90 per cent\r\n  At 1,600°F., the surface carbon content will be 1.00 per cent\r\n  At 1,650°F., the surface carbon content will be 1.10 per cent\r\n  At 1,700°F., the surface carbon content will be 1.25 per cent\r\n  At 1,750°F., the surface carbon content will be 1.40 per cent\r\n  At 1,800°F., the surface carbon content will be 1.75 per cent\r\n\r\nTo this very valuable table, it seems best to add the following\r\ndata, which we have used for a number of years. We do not know\r\nthe name of its author, but it has proved very valuable, and seems\r\nto complete the above information. The table is self-explanatory,\r\ngiving depth of penetration of the carbon of the case at different\r\ntemperatures for different lengths of time:\r\n\r\n ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n                            |         Temperature\r\n        Penetration         |-----------------------------\r\n                            |  1,550  |  1,650  |  1,800\r\n ---------------------------|---------|---------|---------\r\n  Penetration after 1/2 hr. |  0.008  |  0.012  |  0.030\r\n  Penetration after 1 hr.   |  0.018  |  0.026  |  0.045\r\n  Penetration after 2 hr.   |  0.035  |  0.048  |  0.060\r\n  Penetration after 3 hr.   |  0.045  |  0.055  |  0.075\r\n  Penetration after 4 hr.   |  0.052  |  0.061  |  0.092\r\n  Penetration after 6 hr.   |  0.056  |  0.075  |  0.110\r\n  Penetration after 8 hr.   |  0.062  |  0.083  |  0.130\r\n ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom the tables given, we may calculate with a fair degree of certainty\r\nthe amount of carbon in the case, and its penetration. These figures\r\nvary widely with different carburizers, and as pointed out immediately\r\nabove, with different alloy steels.\r\n\r\nCARBURIZING MATERIAL\r\n\r\nThe simplest carburizing substance is charcoal. It is also the\r\nslowest, but is often used mixed with something that will evolve\r\nlarge volumes of carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon gas on being heated.\r\nA great variety of materials is used, a few of them being charcoal\r\n(both wood and bone), charred leather, crushed bone, horn, mixtures\r\nof charcoal and barium carbonate, coke and heavy oils, coke treated\r\nwith alkaline carbonates, peat, charcoal mixed with common salt,\r\nsaltpeter, resin, flour, potassium bichromate, vegetable fibre,\r\nlimestone, various seed husks, etc. In general, it is well to avoid\r\ncomplex mixtures.\r\n\r\nH. L. Heathcote, on analyzing seventeen different carburizers, found\r\nthat they contained the following ingredients:\r\n\r\n                          Per cent\r\n  Moisture             2.68 to 26.17\r\n  Oil                  0.17 to 20.76\r\n  Carbon (organic)     6.70 to 54.19\r\n  Calcium phosphate    0.32 to 74.75\r\n  Calcium carbonate    1.20 to 11.57\r\n  Barium carbonate      nil to 42.00\r\n  Zinc oxide            nil to 14.50\r\n  Silica                nil to  8.14\r\n  Sulphates (SO3)     trace to  3.45\r\n  Sodium chloride       nil to  7.88\r\n  Sodium carbonate      nil to 40.00\r\n  Sulphides (S)         nil to  2.80\r\n\r\nCarburizing mixtures, though bought by weight, are used by volume,\r\nand the weight per cubic foot is a big factor in making a selection.\r\nA good mixture should be porous, so that the evolved gases, which\r\nshould be generated at the proper temperature, may move freely\r\naround the steel objects being carburized; should be a good conductor\r\nof heat; should possess minimum shrinkage when used; and should\r\nbe capable of being tamped down.\r\n\r\nMany \"secret mixtures\" are sold, falsely claimed to be able to\r\nconvert inferior metal into crucible tool steel grade. They are\r\ngenerally nothing more than mixtures of carbonaceous and cyanogen\r\ncompounds possessing the well-known carburizing properties of those\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nQUENCHING\r\n\r\nIt is considered good practice to quench alloy steels from the pot,\r\nespecially if the case is of any appreciable depth. The texture\r\nof carbon steel will be weakened by the prolonged high heat of\r\ncarburizing, so that if we need a tough core, we must reheat it\r\nabove its critical range, which is about 1,600°F. for soft steel,\r\nbut lower for manganese and nickel steels. Quenching is done in\r\neither water, oil, or air, depending upon the results desired.\r\nThe steel is then very carefully reheated to refine the case, the\r\ntemperature varying from 1,350 to 1,450°F., depending on whether\r\nthe material is an alloy or a simple steel, and quenched in either\r\nwater or oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Case-hardening depths.]\r\n\r\nThere are many possibilities yet to be developed with the carburizing\r\nof alloy steels, which can produce a very tough, tenacious austenitic\r\ncase which becomes hard on cooling in air, and still retains a\r\nsoft, pearlitic core. An austenitic case is not necessarily file\r\nhard, but has a very great resistance to abrasive wear.\r\n\r\nThe more carbon a steel has to begin with the more slowly will it\r\nabsorb carbon and the lower the temperature required. Low-carbon\r\nsteel of from 15 to 20 points is generally used and the carbon\r\nbrought up to 80 or 85 points. Tool steels may be carbonized as\r\nhigh as 250 points.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the carburizing materials given, a mixture of 40\r\nper cent of barium carbonate and 60 per cent charcoal gives much\r\nfaster penetration than charcoal, bone or leather. The penetration\r\nof this mixture on ordinary low-carbon steel is shown in Fig. 32,\r\nover a range of from 2 to 12 hr.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF DIFFERENT CARBURIZING MATERIAL\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: FIGS. 33 to 37.]\r\n\r\nEach of these different packing materials has a different effect\r\nupon the work in which it is heated. Charcoal by itself will give\r\na rather light case. Mixed with raw bone it will carburize more\r\nrapidly, and still more so if mixed with burnt bone. Raw bone and\r\nburnt bone, as may be inferred, are both quicker carbonizers than\r\ncharcoal, but raw bone must never be used where the breakage of\r\nhardened edges is to be avoided, as it contains phosphorus and\r\ntends to make the piece brittle. Charred leather mixed with charcoal\r\nis a still faster material, and horns and hoofs exceed even this\r\nin speed; but these two compounds are restricted by their cost\r\nto use with high-grade articles, usually of tool or high-carbon\r\nsteel, that are to be hardened locally--that is, \"pack-hardened.\"\r\nCyanide of potassium or prussiate of potash are also included in\r\nthe list of carbonizing materials; but outside of carburizing by\r\ndipping into melted baths of this material, their use is largely\r\nconfined to local hardening of small surfaces, such as holes in\r\ndies and the like.\r\n\r\nDr. Federico Giolitti has proven that when carbonizing with charcoal,\r\nor charcoal plus barium carbonate, the active agent which introduces\r\ncarbon into the steel is a gas, carbon monoxide (CO), derived by\r\ncombustion of the charcoal in the air trapped in the box, or by\r\ndecomposition of the carbonate. This gas diffuses in and out of\r\nthe hot steel, transporting carbon from the charcoal to the outer\r\nportions of the metal:\r\n\r\nIf energizers like tar, peat, and vegetable fiber are used, they\r\nproduce hydrocarbon gases on being heated--gases principally composed\r\nof hydrogen and carbon. These gases are unstable in the presence of\r\nhot iron: it seems to decompose them and sooty carbon is deposited\r\non the surface of the metal. This diffuses into the metal a little,\r\nbut it acts principally by being a ready source of carbon, highly\r\nactive and waiting to be carried into the metal by the carbon\r\nmonoxide--which as before, is the principal transfer agent.\r\n\r\nAnimal refuse when used to speed up the action of clean charcoal\r\nacts somewhat in the same manner, but in addition the gases given\r\noff by the hot substance contain nitrogen compounds. Nitrogen and\r\ncyanides (compounds of carbon and nitrogen) have long been known\r\nto give a very hard thin case very rapidly. It has been discovered\r\nonly recently that this is due to the steel absorbing nitrogen\r\nas well as carbon, and that nitrogen hardens steel and makes it\r\nbrittle just like carbon does. In fact it is very difficult to\r\ndistinguish between these two hardening agents when examining a\r\ncarburized steel under the microscope.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of hardening by carburizing is the fact that\r\nyou can arrange to leave part of the work soft and thus retain\r\nthe toughness and strength of the original material. Figures 33\r\nto 37 show ways of doing this. The inside of the cup in Fig. 34\r\nis locally hardened, as illustrated in Fig. 34, \"spent\" or used\r\nbone being packed around the surfaces that are to be left soft,\r\nwhile cyanide of potassium is put around those which are desired\r\nhard. The threads of the nut in Fig. 35 are kept soft by carburizing\r\nthe nut while upon a stud. The profile gage, Fig. 36, is made of\r\nhigh-carbon steel and is hardened on the inside by packing with\r\ncharred leather, but kept soft on the outside by surrounding it\r\nwith fireclay. The rivet stud shown in Fig. 37 is carburized while\r\nof its full diameter and then turned down to the size of the rivet\r\nend, thus cutting away the carburized surface.\r\n\r\nAfter packing the work carefully in the boxes the lids are sealed\r\nor luted with fireclay to keep out any gases from the fire. The\r\nsize of box should be proportioned to the work. The box should\r\nnot be too large especially for light work that is run on a short\r\nheat. If it can be just large enough to allow the proper amount\r\nof material around it, the work is apt to be more satisfactory\r\nin every way.\r\n\r\nPieces of this kind are of course not quenched and hardened in\r\nthe carburizing heat, but are left in the box to cool, just as in\r\nbox annealing, being reheated and quenched as a second operation.\r\nIn fact, this is a good scheme to use for the majority of carburizing\r\nwork of small and moderate size. Material is on the market with which\r\none side of the steel can be treated; or copper-plating one side\r\nof it will answer the same purpose and prevent that side becoming\r\ncarburized.\r\n\r\nQUENCHING THE WORK\r\n\r\nIn some operations case-hardened work is quenched from the box by\r\ndumping the whole contents into the quenching tank. It is common\r\npractice to leave a sieve or wire basket to catch the work, allowing\r\nthe carburizing material to fall to the bottom of the tank where it\r\ncan be recovered later and used again as a part of a new mixture.\r\nFor best results, however, the steel is allowed to cool down slowly\r\nin the box after which it is removed and hardened by heating and\r\nquenching the same as carbon steel of the same grade. It has absorbed\r\nsufficient carbon so that, in the outer portions at least, it is\r\na high-carbon steel.\r\n\r\nTHE QUENCHING TANK\r\n\r\nThe quenching tank is an important feature of apparatus in\r\ncase-hardening--possibly more so than in ordinary tempering. One\r\nreason for this is because of the large quantities of pieces usually\r\ndumped into the tank at a time. One cannot take time to separate\r\nthe articles themselves from the case-hardening mixture, and the\r\nwhole content of the box is droped into the bath in short order,\r\nas exposure to air of the heated work is fatal to results. Unless\r\nit is split up, it is likely to go to the bottom as a solid mass,\r\nin which case very few of the pieces are properly hardened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Combination cooling tank for case-hardening.]\r\n\r\nA combination cooling tank is shown in Fig. 38. Water inlet and\r\noutlet pipes are shown and also a drain plug that enables the tank\r\nto be emptied when it is desired to clean out the spent carburizing\r\nmaterial from the bottom. A wire-bottomed tray, framed with angle\r\niron, is arranged to slide into this tank from the top and rests\r\nupon angle irons screwed to the tank sides. Its function is to\r\ncatch the pieces and prevent them from settling to the tank bottom,\r\nand it also makes it easy to remove a batch of work. A bottomless\r\nbox of sheet steel is shown at _C_. This fits into the wire-bottomed\r\ntray and has a number of rods or wires running across it, their\r\npurpose being to break up the mass of material as it comes from\r\nthe carbonizing box.\r\n\r\nBelow the wire-bottomed tray is a perforated cross-pipe that is\r\nconnected with a compressed-air line. This is used when case-hardening\r\nfor colors. The shop that has no air compressor may rig up a\r\nsatisfactory equivalent in the shape of a low-pressure hand-operated\r\nair pump and a receiver tank, for it is not necessary to use\r\nhigh-pressure air for this purpose. When colors are desired on\r\ncase-hardened work, the treatment in quenching is exactly the same\r\nas that previously described except that air is pumped through\r\nthis pipe and keeps the water agitated. The addition of a slight\r\namount of powdered cyanide of potassium to the packing material\r\nused for carburizing will produce stronger colors, and where this is\r\nthe sole object, it is best to maintain the box at a dull-red heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Why heat treatment of case-hardened work\r\nis necessary.]\r\n\r\nThe old way of case-hardening was to dump the contents of the box\r\nat the end of the carburizing heat. Later study in the structure\r\nof steel thus treated has caused a change in this procedure, the\r\nuse of automobiles and alloy steels probably hastening this result.\r\nThe diagrams reproduced in Fig. 39 show why the heat treatment of\r\ncase-hardened work is necessary. Starting at _A_ with a close-grained\r\nand tough stock, such as ordinary machinery steel containing from 15\r\nto 20 points of carbon, if such work is quenched on a carbonizing\r\nheat the result will be as shown at _B_. This gives a core that is\r\ncoarse-grained and brittle and an outer case that is fine-grained\r\nand hard, but is likely to flake off, owing to the great difference\r\nin structure between it and the core. Reheating this work beyond\r\nthe critical temperature of the core refines this core, closes\r\nthe grain and makes it tough, but leaves the case very brittle;\r\nin fact, more so than it was before.\r\n\r\nREFINING THE GRAIN\r\n\r\nThis is remedied by reheating the piece to a temperature slightly\r\nabove the critical temperature of the case, this temperature\r\ncorresponding ordinarily to that of steel having a carbon content\r\nof 85 points, When this is again quenched, the temperature, which\r\nhas not been high enough to disturb the refined core, will have\r\nclosed the grain of the case and toughened it. So, instead of but\r\none heat and one quenching for this class of work, we have three\r\nof each, although it is quite possible and often profitable to\r\nomit the quenching after carburizing and allow the piece or pieces\r\nand the case-carburizing box to cool together, as in annealing.\r\nSometimes another heat treatment is added to the foregoing, for\r\nthe purpose of letting down the hardness of the case and giving\r\nit additional toughness by heating to a temperature between 300°\r\nand 500°. Usually this is done in an oil bath. After this the piece\r\nis allowed to cool.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to harden the surface of tool steel extremely hard\r\nand yet leave its inner core soft and tough for strength, by a\r\nprocess similar to case-hardening and known as \"pack-hardening.\"\r\nIt consists in using tool steel of carbon contents ranging from\r\n60 to 80 points, packing this in a box with charred leather mixed\r\nwith wood charcoal and heating at a low-red heat for 2 or 3 hr.,\r\nthus raising the carbon content of the exterior of the piece. The\r\narticle when quenched in an oil bath will have an extremely hard\r\nexterior and tough core. It is a good scheme for tools that must\r\nbe hard and yet strong enough to stand abuse. Raw bone is never\r\nused as a packing for this class of work, as it makes the cutting\r\nedges brittle.\r\n\r\nCASE-HARDENING TREATMENTS FOR VARIOUS STEELS\r\n\r\nPlain water, salt water and linseed oil are the three most common\r\nquenching materials for case-hardening. Water is used for ordinary\r\nwork, salt water for work which must be extremely hard on the surface,\r\nand oil for work in which toughness is the main consideration. The\r\nhigher the carbon of the case, the less sudden need the quenching\r\naction take hold of the piece; in fact, experience in case-hardening\r\nwork gives a great many combinations of quenching baths of these\r\nthree materials, depending on their temperatures. Thin work, highly\r\ncarbonized, which would fly to pieces under the slightest blow if\r\nquenched in water or brine, is made strong and tough by properly\r\nquenching in slightly heated oil. It is impossible to give any\r\nrules for the temperature of this work, so much depending on the\r\nsize and design of the piece; but it is not a difficult matter to\r\ntry three or four pieces by different methods and determine what\r\nis needed for best results.\r\n\r\nThe alloy steels are all susceptible of case-hardening treatment;\r\nin fact, this is one of the most important heat treatments for such\r\nsteels in the automobile industry. Nickel steel carburizes more\r\nslowly than common steel, the nickel seeming to have the effect\r\nof slowing down the rate of penetration. There is no cloud without\r\nits silver lining, however, and to offset this retardation, a single\r\ntreatment is often sufficient for nickel steel; for the core is not\r\ncoarsened as much as low-carbon machinery steel and thus ordinary\r\nwork may be quenched on the carburizing heat. Steel containing\r\nfrom 3 to 3.5 per cent of nickel is carburized between 1,650 and\r\n1,750°F. Nickel steel containing less than 25 points of carbon,\r\nwith this same percentage of nickel, may be slightly hardened by\r\ncooling in air instead of quenching.\r\n\r\nChrome-nickel steel may be case-hardened similarly to the method just\r\ndescribed for nickel steel, but double treatment gives better results\r\nand is used for high-grade work. The carburizing temperature is the\r\nsame, between 1,650 and 1,750°F., the second treatment consisting\r\nof reheating to 1,400° and then quenching in boiling salt water,\r\nwhich gives a hard surface and at the same time prevents distortion\r\nof the piece. The core of chrome-nickel case-hardened steel, like\r\nthat of nickel steel, is not coarsened excessively by the first\r\nheat treatment, and therefore a single heating and quenching will\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\nCARBURIZING BY GAS\r\n\r\nThe process of carburizing by gas, briefly mentioned on page 88,\r\nconsists of having a slowly revolving, properly heated, cylindrical\r\nretort into which illuminating gas (a mixture of various hydrocarbons)\r\nis continuously injected under pressure. The spent gases are vented\r\nto insure the greatest speed in carbonizing. The work is constantly\r\nand uniformly exposed to a clean carbonizing atmosphere instead\r\nof partially spent carbonaceous solids which may give off very\r\ncomplex compounds of phosphorus, sulphur, carbon and nitrogen.\r\n\r\nOriginally this process was thought to require a gas generator but\r\nit has been discovered that city gas works all right. The gas consists\r\nof vapors derived from petroleum or bituminous coal. Sometimes the\r\ngas supply is diluted by air, to reduce the speed of carburization\r\nand increase the depth.\r\n\r\nPREVENTING CARBURIZING BY COPPER-PLATING\r\n\r\nCopper-plating has been found effective and must have a thickness\r\nof 0.0005 in. Less than this does not give a continuous coating.\r\nThe plating bath used has a temperature of 170°F. A voltage of\r\n4.1 is to be maintained across the terminals. Regions which are\r\nto be hardened can be kept free from copper by coating them with\r\nparaffin before they enter the plating tank. The operation is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOperation\r\n   No.             Contents of bath                   Purpose\r\n    1      Gasoline                           To remove grease\r\n    2      Sawdust                            To dry\r\n    3      Warm potassium hydroxide solution  To remove grease and dirt\r\n    4      Warm water                         To wash\r\n    5      Warm sulphuric acid solution       To acid clean\r\n    6      Warm water                         To wash\r\n    7      Cold water                         Additional wash\r\n    8      Cold potassium cyanide solution    Cleanser\r\n    9      Cold water                         To wash\r\n   10      Electric cleaner, warm sodium      Cleanser to give good\r\n             hydroxide case-iron anode          plating surface\r\n   11      Copper plating bath of copper      Plating bath\r\n             sulphate and potassium cyanide\r\n             solution warm\r\n\r\nThere are also other methods of preventing case-hardening, one\r\nbeing to paint the surface with a special compound prepared for\r\nthis purpose. In some cases a coating of plastic asbestos is used\r\nwhile in others thin sheet asbestos is wired around the part to\r\nbe kept soft.\r\n\r\nPREPARING PARTS FOR LOCAL CASE-HARDENING\r\n\r\nAt the works of the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company, Dayton,\r\nOhio, they have a large quantity of small shafts, Fig. 40, that\r\nare to be case-hardened at _A_ while the ends _B_ and _C_ are to\r\nbe left soft. Formerly, the part _A_ was brush-coated with melted\r\nparaffin but, as there were many shafts, this was tedious and great\r\ncare was necessary to avoid getting paraffin where it was not wanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Shaft to be coated with paraffin.]\r\n\r\nTo insure uniform coating the device shown in Fig. 41 was made.\r\nMelted paraffin is poured in the well _A_ and kept liquid by setting\r\nthe device on a hot plate, the paraffin being kept high enough\r\nto touch the bottoms of the rollers. The shaft to be coated is\r\nlaid between the rollers with one end against the gage _B_, when\r\na turn or two of the crank _C_ will cause it to be evenly coated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Device for coating the shaft.]\r\n\r\nTHE PENETRATION OF CARBON\r\n\r\nCarburized mild steel is used to a great extent in the manufacture\r\nof automobile and other parts which are likely to be subjected to\r\nrough usage. The strength and ability to withstand hard knocks\r\ndepend to a very considerable degree on the thoroughness with which\r\nthe carburizing process is conducted.\r\n\r\nMany automobile manufacturers have at one time or another passed\r\nthrough a period of unfortunate breakages, or have found that for\r\na certain period the parts turned out of their hardening shops\r\nwere not sufficiently hard to enable the rubbing surfaces to stand\r\nup against the pressure to which they were subjected.\r\n\r\nSo many factors govern the success of hardening that often this\r\nsuccession of bad work has been actually overcome without those\r\ninterested realizing what was the weak point in their system of\r\ntreatment. As the question is one that can create a bad reputation\r\nfor the product of any firm it is well to study the influential\r\nfactors minutely.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF CARBON\r\n\r\nThe matter to which these notes are primarily directed is the\r\nintroduction of carbon into the case of the article to be hardened.\r\nIn the first place the chances of success are increased by selecting\r\nas few brands of steel as practicable to cover the requirements of\r\neach component of the mechanism. The hardener is then able to become\r\naccustomed to the characteristics of that particular material, and\r\nafter determining the most suitable treatment for it no further\r\nexperimenting beyond the usual check-test pieces is necessary.\r\n\r\nAlthough a certain make of material may vary in composition from\r\ntime to time the products of a manufacturer of good steel can be\r\ngenerally relied upon, and it is better to deal directly with him\r\nthan with others.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the case-hardening steels can be chosen from the\r\nfollowing: (1) Case-hardening mild steel of 0.20 per cent carbon;\r\n(2) case-hardening 3-1/2 per cent nickel steel; (3) case-hardening\r\nnickel-chromium steel; (4) case-hardening chromium vanadium. After\r\nhaving chosen a suitable steel it is best to have the sample analyzed\r\nby reliable chemists and also to have test pieces machined and pulled.\r\n\r\nTo prepare samples for analysis place a sheet of paper on the table\r\nof a drilling machine, and with a 3/8-in. diameter drill, machine\r\na few holes about 3/8 in. deep in various parts of the sample bar,\r\ncollecting about 3 oz. of fine drillings free from dust. This can be\r\nplaced in a bottle and dispatched to the laboratory with instructions\r\nto search for carbon, silicon, manganese, sulphur, phosphorus and\r\nalloys. The results of the different tests should be carefully\r\ntabulated, and as there would most probably be some variation an\r\naverage should be made as a fair basis of each element present,\r\nand the following tables may be used with confidence when deciding\r\nif the material is reliable enough to be used.\r\n\r\nTABLE 16.--CASE-HARDENING MILD STEEL OF 0.20 PER CENT CARBON\r\n\r\n  Carbon          0.15 to 0.25 per cent\r\n  Silicon        Not over 0.20 per cent\r\n  Manganese       0.30 to 0.60 per cent\r\n  Sulphur        Not over 0.04 per cent\r\n  Phosphorus     Not over 0.04 per cent\r\n\r\nA tension test should register at least 60,000 lb. per square inch.\r\n\r\nTABLE 17.--CASE-HARDENING 3-1/2 PER CENT NICKEL STEEL\r\n\r\n  Carbon          0.12 to 0.20 per cent\r\n  Manganese               0.65 per cent\r\n  Sulphur       Not over 0.045 per cent\r\n  Phosphorus     Not over 0.04 per cent\r\n  Nickel          3.25 to 3.75 per cent\r\n\r\nTABLE 18.--CASE-HARDENING NICKEL CHROMIUM STEEL\r\n\r\n  Carbon          0.15 to 0.25 per cent\r\n  Manganese       0.50 to 0.80 per cent\r\n  Sulphur       Not over 0.045 per cent\r\n  Phosphorus     Not over 0.04 per cent\r\n  Nickel              1 to 1.5 per cent\r\n  Chromium        0.45 to 0.75 per cent\r\n\r\nTABLE 19.--CASE-HARDENING CHROMIUM VANADIUM STEEL\r\n\r\n  Carbon         Not over 0.25 per cent\r\n  Manganese       0.50 to 0.85 per cent\r\n  Sulphur        Not over 0.04 per cent\r\n  Phosphorus     Not over 0.04 per cent\r\n  Chromium        0.80 to 1.10 per cent\r\n  Vanadium  Not less than 0.15 per cent\r\n\r\nHaving determined what is required we now proceed to inquire into\r\nthe question of carburizing, which is of vital importance.\r\n\r\nUSING ILLUMINATING GAS\r\n\r\nThe choice of a carburizing furnace depends greatly on the facilities\r\navailable in the locality where the shop is situated and the nature\r\nand quantity of the work to be done. The furnaces can be heated with\r\nproducer gas in most cases, but when space is of value illuminating\r\ngas from a separate source of supply has some compensations. When\r\nthe latter is used it is well to install a governor if the pressure\r\nis likely to fluctuate, particularly where the shop is at a high\r\naltitude or at a long distance from the gas supply.\r\n\r\nMany furnaces are coal-fired, and although greater care is required\r\nin maintaining a uniform temperature good results have been obtained.\r\nThe use of electricity as a means of reaching the requisite temperature\r\nis receiving some attention, and no doubt it would make the control\r\nof temperature comparatively simple. However, the cost when applied\r\nto large quantities of work will, for the present at least, prevent\r\nthis method from becoming popular. It is believed that the results\r\nobtainable \\with the electric furnace would surpass any others; but\r\nthe apparatus is expensive, and unless handled with intelligence\r\nwould not last long.\r\n\r\nThe most elementary medium of carburization is pure carbon, but\r\nthe rate of carburization induced by this material is very low,\r\nand other components are necessary to accelerate the process. Many\r\nmixtures have been marketed, each possessing its individual merits,\r\nand as the prices vary considerably it is difficult to decide which\r\nis the most advantageous.\r\n\r\nAbsorption from actual contact with solid carbon is decidedly slow,\r\nand it is necessary to employ a compound from which gases are liberated,\r\nand the steel will absorb the carbon from the gases much more readily.\r\n\r\nBoth bone and leather charcoal give off more carburizing gases\r\nthan wood charcoal, and although the high sulphur content of the\r\nleather is objectionable as being injurious to the steel, as also\r\nis the high phosphorus content of the bone charcoal, they are both\r\npreferable to the wood charcoal.\r\n\r\nBy mixing bone charcoal with barium carbonate in the proportions\r\nof 60 per cent of the former to 40 per cent of the latter a very\r\nreliable compound is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe temperature to which this compound is subjected causes the\r\nliberation of carbon monoxide when in contact with hot charcoal.\r\n\r\nMany more elaborate explanations may be given of the actions and\r\nreactions taking place, but the above is a satisfactory guide to\r\nindicate that it is not the actual compound which causes carburization,\r\nbut the gases released from the compound.\r\n\r\nUntil the temperature of the muffle reaches about 1,300°F. carburization\r\ndoes not take place to any useful extent, and consequently it is\r\nadvisable to avoid the use of any compound from which the carburizing\r\ngases are liberated much before that temperature is reached. In\r\nthe case of steel containing nickel slightly higher temperatures\r\nmay be used and are really necessary if the same rate of carbon\r\npenetration is to be obtained, as the presence of nickel resists\r\nthe penetration.\r\n\r\nAt higher temperatures the rate of penetration is higher, but not\r\nexactly in proportion to the temperature, and the rate is also\r\ninfluenced by the nature of the material and the efficiency of the\r\ncompound employed.\r\n\r\nThe so-called saturation point of mild steel is reached when the\r\ncase contains 0.90 per cent of carbon, but this amount is frequently\r\nexceeded. Should it be required to ascertain the amount of carbon\r\nin a sample at varying depths below the skin this can be done by\r\nturning off a small amount after carburizing and analyzing the\r\nturnings. This can be repeated several times, and it will probably\r\nbe found that the proportion of carbon decreases as the test piece\r\nis reduced in diameter unless decarburization has taken place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Chart showing penetration of carbon.]\r\n\r\nThe chart, Fig. 42, is also a good guide.\r\n\r\nIn order to use the chart it is necessary to harden the sample\r\nwe desire to test as we would harden a piece of tool steel, and\r\nthen test by scleroscope. By locating on the chart the point on\r\nthe horizontal axis which represents the hardness of the sample\r\nthe curve enables one to determine the approximate amount of carbon\r\npresent in the case.\r\n\r\nShould the hardness lack uniformity the soft places can be identified\r\nby etching. To accomplish this the sample should be polished after\r\nquenching and then washed with a weak solution of nitric acid in\r\nalcohol, whereupon the harder points will show up darker than the\r\nsofter areas.\r\n\r\nThe selection of suitable boxes for carburizing is worthy of a\r\nlittle consideration, and there can be no doubt that in certain\r\ncases results are spoiled and considerable expense caused by using\r\nunsuitable containers.\r\n\r\nAs far as initial expense goes cast-iron boxes are probably the\r\nmost expedient, but although they will withstand the necessary\r\ntemperatures they are liable to split and crack, and when they\r\nget out of shape there is much difficulty in straightening them.\r\n\r\nThe most suitable material in most cases is steel boiler plate 3/8\r\nor 1/2 in. thick, which can be made with welded joints and will\r\nlast well.\r\n\r\nThe sizes of the boxes employed depend to a great extent on the\r\nnature of the work being done, but care should be exercised to\r\navoid putting too much in one box, as smaller ones permit the heat\r\nto penetrate more quickly, and one test piece is sufficient to\r\ngive a good indication of what has taken place. If it should be\r\nnecessary to use larger boxes it is advisable to put in three or four\r\ntest pieces in different positions to ascertain if the penetration\r\nof carbon has been satisfactory in all parts of the box, as it\r\nis quite possible that the temperature of the muffle is not the\r\nsame at all points, and a record shown by one test piece would\r\nnot then be applicable to all the parts contained in the box. It\r\nhas been found that the rate of carbon penetration increases with\r\nthe gas pressure around the articles being carburized, and it is\r\ntherefore necessary to be careful in sealing up the boxes after\r\npacking. When the articles are placed within and each entirely\r\nsurrounded by compound so that the compound reaches to within 1\r\nin. of the top of the box a layer of clay should be run around the\r\ninside of the box on top of the compound. The lid, which should\r\nbe a good fit in the box, is then to be pressed on top of this,\r\nand another layer of clay run just below the rim of the box on\r\ntop of the cover.\r\n\r\nA SATISFACTORY LUTING MIXTURE\r\n\r\nA mixture of fireclay and sand will be found very satisfactory\r\nfor closing up the boxes, and by observing the appearance of the\r\nwork when taken out we can gage the suitability of the methods\r\nemployed, for unless the boxes are carefully sealed the work is\r\ngenerally covered with dark scales, while if properly done the\r\narticles will be of a light gray.\r\n\r\nBy observing the above recommendations reliable results can be obtained,\r\nand we can expect uniform results after quenching.\r\n\r\nGAS CONSUMPTION FOR CARBURIZING\r\n\r\nAlthough the advantages offered by the gas-fired furnace for carburizing\r\nhave been generally recognized in the past from points of view as\r\nclose temperature regulation, decreased attendance, and greater\r\nconvenience, very little information has been published regarding\r\nthe consumption of gas for this process. It has therefore been a\r\nmatter of great difficulty to obtain authentic information upon\r\nthis point, either from makers or users of such furnaces.\r\n\r\nIn view of this, the details of actual consumption of gas on a\r\nregular customer's order job will be of interest. The \"Revergen\"\r\nfurnace, manufactured by the Davis Furnace Company, Luton, Bedford,\r\nEngland, was used on this job, and is provided with regenerators\r\nand fired with illuminating gas at ordinary pressure, the air being\r\nintroduced to the furnace at a slight pressure of 3 to 4 in. water\r\ngage. The material was charged into a cold furnace, raised to 1,652°F.,\r\nand maintained at that temperature for 8 hr. to give the necessary\r\ndepth of case. The work consisted of automobile gears packed in\r\nsix boxes, the total weight being 713 lb. The required temperature\r\nof 1,652°F. was obtained in 70 min. from lighting up, and a summary\r\nof the data is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                                           Cubic Foot      Total\r\n                                           Per Pound     Number of\r\n                                            of Load      Cubic Foot\r\n  Gas to raise furnace and charge from\r\n    cold to 1,652°F., 70 min.                1.29           925\r\n  Gas to maintain 1,652°F. for 1st hour      0.38           275\r\n  Gas to maintain 1,652°F. for 2nd hour      0.42           300\r\n  Gas to maintain 1,652°F. for 3rd hour      0.38           275\r\n  Gas to maintain 1,652°F. for 4th hour      0.42           300\r\n  Gas to maintain 1,652°F. for 5th hour      0.49           350\r\n  Gas to maintain 1,652°F. for 6th hour      0.49           350\r\n  Gas to maintain 1,652°F. for 7th hour      0.45           325\r\n  Gas to maintain 1,652°F. for 8th hour      0.45           325\r\n\r\nThe overall gas consumption for this run of 9 hr. 10 min. was only\r\n4.8 cu. ft. per pound of load.\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF CARBURIZING COMPOUNDS\r\n\r\nOf all the opportunities for practicing economy in the heat-treatment\r\ndepartment, there is none that offers greater possibilities for\r\nprofitable returns than the systematic cleaning, blending and reworking\r\nof artificial carburizers, or compounds.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether or not it is practical to take up the work\r\ndepends upon the nature of the output. If the sole product of the\r\nhardening department consists of a 1.10 carbon case or harder,\r\nrequiring a strong highly energized material of deep penetrative\r\npower such as that used in the carburizing of ball races, hub-bearings\r\nand the like, it would be best to dispose of the used material to\r\nsome concern whose product requires a case with from 0.70 to 0.90\r\ncarbon, but where there is a large variety of work the compound\r\nmay be so handled that there will be practically no waste.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished with one of the most widely known artificial\r\ncarburizers by giving all the compound in the plant three distinct\r\nclassifications: \"New,\" being direct from the maker; \"half and\r\nhalf,\" being one part of new and one part first run; and \"2 to 1,\"\r\nwhich consists of two parts of old and one part new.\r\n\r\nSEPARATING THE WORK FROM THE COMPOUND\r\n\r\nDuring the pulling of the heat, the pots are dumped upon a cast-iron\r\nscreen which forms a table or apron for the furnace. Directly beneath\r\nthis table is located one of the steel conveyor carts, shown in Fig.\r\n43, which is provided with two wheels at the rear and a dolly clevis\r\nat the front, which allows it to be hauled away from beneath the\r\nfurnace apron while filled with red-hot compound. A steel cover is\r\nprovided for each box, and the material is allowed to cool without\r\nlosing much of the evolved gases which are still being thrown off\r\nby the compound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--The cooling carts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Machine for blending the mixture.]\r\n\r\nAs this compound comes from the carburizing pots it contains bits\r\nof fireclay which represent a part of the luting used for sealing,\r\nand there may be small parts of work or bits of fused material\r\nin it as well. After cooling, the compound is very dusty and\r\ndisagreeable to handle, and, before it can be used again, must be\r\nsifted, cleaned and blended.\r\n\r\nSome time ago the writer was confronted with this proposition for\r\none of the largest consumers of carburizing compound in the world,\r\nand the problem was handled in the following manner: The cooled\r\ncompound was dumped from the cooling cars and sprinkled with a\r\nlow-grade oil which served the dual purposes of settling the dust\r\nand adding a certain percentage of valuable hydrocarbon to the\r\ncompound. In Fig. 44 is shown the machine that was designed to do\r\nthe cleaning and blending.\r\n\r\nBLENDING THE COMPOUND\r\n\r\nEssentially, this consists of the sturdy, power-driven separator\r\nand fanning mill which separates the foreign matter from the compound\r\nand elevates it into a large settling basin which is formed by\r\nthe top of the steel housing that incloses the apparatus. After\r\nreaching the settling basin, the compound falls by gravity into\r\na power-driven rotary mixing tub which is directly beneath the\r\nsettling basin. Here the blending is done by mixing the proper\r\namount of various grades of material together. After blending the\r\ncompound, it is ready to be stored in labeled containers and delivered\r\nto the packing room.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that by this simple system there is the least possible\r\nloss of energy from the compound. The saving commences the moment\r\nthe cooling cart is covered and preserves the valuable dust which is\r\nsaved by the oiling and the settling basin of the blending machine.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there is the added convenience of the packers who have\r\na thoroughly cleaned, dustless, and standardized product to work\r\nwith. Of course, this also tends to insure uniformity in the\r\ncase-hardening operation.\r\n\r\nWith this outfit, one man cleans and blends as much compound in\r\none hour as he formerly did in ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nHEAT TREATMENT OF STEEL\r\n\r\nHeat treatment consists in heating and cooling metal at definite\r\nrates in order to change its physical condition. Many objects may\r\nbe attained by correct heat treatment, but nothing much can be\r\nexpected unless the man who directs the operations knows what is\r\nthe essential difference in a piece of steel at room temperature\r\nand at a red heat, other than the obvious fact that it is hot. The\r\nscience of metallography has been developed in the past 25 years,\r\nand aided by precise methods of measuring temperature, has done\r\nmuch to systematize the information which we possess on metallic\r\nalloys, and steel in particular.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL POINTS\r\n\r\nOne of the most important means of investigating the properties of\r\npure metals and their alloys is by an examination of their heating\r\nand cooling curves. Such curves are constructed by taking a small\r\npiece and observing and recording the temperature of the mass at\r\nuniform intervals of time during a _uniform_ heating or cooling.\r\nThese observations, when plotted in the form of a curve will show\r\nwhether the temperature of the mass rises or falls uniformly.\r\n\r\nThe heat which a body absorbs serves either to raise the temperature\r\nof the mass or change its physical condition. That portion of the\r\nheat which results in an increase in temperature of the body is\r\ncalled \"sensible heat,\" inasmuch as such a gain in heat is apparent\r\nto the physical senses of the observer. If heat were supplied to the\r\nbody at a uniform rate, the temperature would rise continuously,\r\nand if the temperature were plotted against time, a smooth rising\r\ncurve would result. Or, if sensible heat were abstracted from the\r\nbody at a uniform rate, a time-temperature curve would again be a\r\nsmooth falling curve. Such a curve is called a \"cooling curve.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, we find that when a body is melting, vaporizing, or otherwise\r\nsuffering an abrupt change in physical properties, a quantity of\r\nheat is absorbed which disappears without changing the temperature\r\nof the body. This heat absorbed during a change of state is called\r\n\"latent heat,\" because it is transformed into the work necessary to\r\nchange the configuration and disposition of the molecules in the\r\nbody; but it is again liberated in equal amount when the reverse\r\nchange takes place.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it would seem that should the cooling\r\ncurve be continuous and smooth, following closely a regular course,\r\nall the heat abstracted during cooling is furnished at the expense\r\nof a fall in temperature of the body; that is to say, it disappears\r\nas \"sensible heat.\" These curves, however, frequently show horizontal\r\nportions or \"arrests\" which denote that at that temperature all\r\nof the heat constantly radiating is being supplied by internal\r\nchanges in the alloy itself; that is, it is being supplied by the\r\nevolution of a certain amount of \"latent heat.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the large amount of heat liberated when a metal\r\nsolidifies, there are other changes indicated by the thermal analysis\r\nof many alloys which occur _after_ the body has become entirely\r\nsolidified. These so-called transformation points or ranges may\r\nbe caused by chemical reactions taking place within the solid,\r\nsubstances being precipitated from a \"solid solution,\" or a sudden\r\nchange in some physical property of the components, such as in\r\nmagnetism, hardness, or specific gravity.\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to comprehend that such changes can occur in\r\na body after it has become entirely solidified, owing to the usual\r\nconception that the particles are then rigidly fixed. However, this\r\nrigidity is only comparative. The molecules in the solid state\r\nhave not the large mobility they possess as a liquid, but even so,\r\nthey are still moving in circumscribed orbits, and have the power,\r\nunder proper conditions, to rearrange their position or internal\r\nconfiguration. In general, such rearrangement is accompanied by a\r\nsudden change in some physical property and in the total energy\r\nof the molecule, which is evidenced by a spontaneous evolution or\r\nabsorption of latent heat.\r\n\r\nCooling curves of the purest iron show at least two well-defined\r\ndiscontinuities at temperatures more than 1,000°F., below its\r\nfreezing-point. It seems that the soft, magnetic metal so familiar\r\nas wrought iron, and called \"alpha iron\" or \"ferrite\" by the\r\nmetallurgist, becomes unstable at about 1,400°F. and changes into\r\nthe so-called \"beta\" modification, becoming suddenly harder, and\r\nlosing its magnetism. This state in turn persists no higher than\r\n1,706°C., when a softer, non-magnetic \"gamma\" iron is the stable\r\nmodification up to the actual melting-point of the metal. These\r\nvarious changes occur in electrolytic iron, and therefore cannot be\r\nattributed to any chemical reaction or solution; they are entirely\r\ndue to the existence of \"allotropic modifications\" of the iron in\r\nits solid state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Inverse Rate Cooling Curve of 0.38 C Steel.]\r\n\r\nSteels, or iron containing a certain amount of carbon, develop\r\nsomewhat different cooling curves from those produced by pure iron.\r\nFigure 45 shows, for instance, some data observed on a cooling\r\npiece of 0.38 per cent carbon steel, and the curve constructed\r\ntherefrom. It will be noted that the time was noted when the needle\r\non the pyrometer passed each dial marking. If the metal were not\r\nchanging in its physical condition, the time between each reading\r\nwould be nearly constant; in fact for a time it required about 50\r\nsec. to cool each unit. When the dial read about 32.5 (corresponding\r\nin this instrument to a temperature of 775°C. or 1,427°F.) the\r\ncooling rate shortened materially, 55 sec. then 65, then 100, then\r\n100; showing that some change inside the metal was furnishing some\r\nof the steadily radiating heat. This temperature is the so-called\r\n\"upper critical\" for this steel. Further down, the \"lower critical\"\r\nis shown by a large heat evolution at 695°C. or 1,283°F.\r\n\r\nJust the reverse effects take place upon heating, except that the\r\ntemperatures shown are somewhat higher--there seems to be a lag\r\nin the reactions taking place in the steel. This is an important\r\npoint to remember, because if it was desired to anneal a piece of\r\n0.38 carbon steel, it is necessary to heat it up to and beyond\r\n1,476° F. (1,427°F. _plus_ this lag, which may be as much as 50°).\r\n\r\nIt may be said immediately that above the upper critical the carbon\r\nexists in the iron as a \"solid solution,\" called \"austenite\" by\r\nmetallographers. That is to say, it is uniformly distributed as atoms\r\nthroughout the iron; the atoms of carbon are not present in any fixed\r\ncombination, in fact any amount of carbon from zero to 1.7 per cent\r\ncan enter into solid solution above the upper critical. However,\r\nupon cooling this steel, the carbon again enters into combination\r\nwith a definite proportion of iron (the carbide \"cementite,\" Fe3C),\r\nand accumulates into small crystals which can be seen under a good\r\nmicroscope. Formation of all the cementite has been completed by\r\nthe time the temperature has fallen to the lower critical, and\r\nbelow that temperature the steel exists as a complex substance\r\nof pure iron and the iron carbide.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the critical points or critical range\r\nof a plain steel varies with its carbon content. The following\r\ntable gives some average figures:\r\n\r\n  Carbon Content.  Upper Critical.  Lower Critical.\r\n        0.00           1,706°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        0.20           1,600°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        0.40           1,480°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        0.60           1,400°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        0.80           1,350°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        0.90           1,330°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        1.00           1,470°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        1.20           1,650°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        1.40           1,830°F.         1,330°F.\r\n        1.60           2,000°F.         1,330°F.\r\n\r\nIt is immediately noted that the critical range narrows with increasing\r\ncarbon content until all the heat seems to be liberated at one\r\ntemperature in a steel of 0.90 per cent carbon. Beyond that composition\r\nthe critical range widens rapidly. Note also that the lower critical\r\nis constant in plain carbon steels containing no alloying elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Microphotograph of steel used in S. K.\r\nF. bearings, polished and etched with nitric acid and magnified\r\n1,000 times. Made by H. O. Walp.]\r\n\r\nThis steel of 0.90 carbon content is an important one. It is called\r\n\"eutectoid\" steel. Under the microscope a properly polished and\r\netched sample shows the structure to consist of thin sheets of\r\ntwo different substances (Fig. 46). One of these is pure iron,\r\nand the other is pure cementite. This structure of thin sheets\r\nhas received the name \"pearlite,\" because of its pearly appearance\r\nunder sunlight. Pearlite is a constituent found in all annealed\r\ncarbon steels. Pure iron, having no carbon, naturally would show no\r\npearlite when examined under a microscope; only abutting granules\r\nof iron are delicately traced. The metallographist calls this pure\r\niron \"ferrite.\" As soon as a little carbon enters the alloy and a\r\nsoft steel is formed, small angular areas of pearlite appear at the\r\nboundaries of the ferrite crystals (Fig. 47). With increasing carbon\r\nin the steel the volume of iron crystals becomes less and less, and\r\nthe relative amount of pearlite increases, until arriving at 0.90\r\nper cent carbon, the large ferrite crystals have been suppressed and\r\nthe structure is all pearlite. Higher carbon steels show films of\r\ncementite outlining grains of pearlite (Fig. 48).\r\n\r\nThis represents the structure of annealed, slowly cooled steels.\r\nIt is possible to change the relative sizes of the ferrite and\r\ncementite crystals by heat treatment. Large grains are associated\r\nwith brittleness. Consequently one must avoid heat treatments which\r\nproduce coarse grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Structure of low carbon steel, polished,\r\netched and viewed under 100 magnifications.

The dark grains are pearlite,\r\nseparated by white films of iron carbide (cementite). Photograph\r\nby H. S. Rawdon.]\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that the previous crystalline structure\r\nof a steel is entirely obliterated when it passes just through the\r\ncritical range. At that moment, in fact, the ferrite, cementite or\r\npearlite which previously existed has lost its identity by everything\r\ngoing into the solid solution called austenite. If sufficient time\r\nis given, the chemical elements comprising a good steel distribute\r\nthemselves uniformly through the mass. If the steel be then cooled,\r\nthe austenite breaks up into new crystals of ferrite, cementite\r\nand pearlite; and in general if the temperature has not gone far\r\nabove the critical, and cooling is not excessively slow, a very\r\nfine texture will result. This is called \"refining\" the grain;\r\nor in shop parlance \"closing\" the grain. However, if the heating\r\nhas gone above the critical very far, the austenite crystals start\r\nto grow; a very short time at an extreme temperature will cause\r\na large grain growth. Subsequent cooling gives a coarse texture,\r\nor an arrangement of ferrite, cementite and pearlite grains which\r\nis greatly coarsened, reflecting the condition of the austenite\r\ncrystals from which they were born.\r\n\r\nIt maybe noted in passing that the coarse crystals of cast metal\r\ncannot generally be refined by heat treatment unless some forging\r\nor rolling has been done in the meantime. Heat treatment alone does\r\nnot seem to be able to break up the crystals of an ingot structure.\r\n\r\nHARDENING\r\n\r\nSteel is hardened by quenching from above the upper critical. Apparently\r\nthe quick cooling prevents the normal change back to definite and\r\nsizeable crystals of ferrite and cementite. Hardness is associated\r\nwith this suppressed change. If the change is allowed to continue\r\nby a moderate reheating, like a tempering, the hardness decreases.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of steel could be cooled instantly, doubtless austenite\r\ncould be preserved and examined. In the ordinary practice of hardening\r\nsteels, the quenching is not so drastic, and the transformation of\r\naustenite back to ferrite and cementite is more or less completely\r\neffected, giving rise to certain transitory forms which are known\r\nas \"martensite,\" \"troostite,\" \"sorbite,\" and finally, pearlite.\r\n\r\nAustenite has been defined as a solid solution of cementite (Fe3C)\r\nin gamma iron. It is stable at various temperatures dependent upon\r\nits carbon content, which may be any amount up to the saturated\r\nsolution containing 1.7 per cent. Austenite is not nearly as hard\r\nas martensite, owing to its content of the soft gamma iron. Fig.\r\n49 shows austenite to possess the typical appearance of any pure,\r\ncrystallized substance.\r\n\r\nIn the most quickly quenched high carbon steels, austenite commonly\r\nforms the ground mass which is interspersed with martensite, a large\r\nfield of which is illustrated in Fig. 50. Martensite is usually\r\nconsidered to be a solid solution of cementite in beta iron. It\r\nrepresents an unstable condition in which the metal is caught during\r\nrapid cooling. It is very hard, and is the chief constituent of\r\nhardened high-carbon steels, and of medium-carbon nickel-steel\r\nand manganese-steel.\r\n\r\nTroostite is of doubtful composition, but possibly is an unstable\r\nmixture of untransformed martensite with sorbite. It contains more\r\nor less untransformed material, as it is too hard to be composed\r\nentirely of the soft alpha modification, and it can also be tempered\r\nmore or less without changing in appearance. Its normal appearance as\r\nrounded grains is given in Fig. 51; larger patches show practically\r\nno relief in their structure, and a photograph merely shows a dark,\r\nstructureless area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Coarse-grained martensite, polished and\r\netched with nitric acid and magnified 50 times. Made by Prof. Chas.\r\nY. Clayton.]\r\n\r\nSorbite is believed to be an early stage in the formation of pearlite,\r\nwhen the iron and iron carbide originally constituting the solid\r\nsolution (austenite) have had an opportunity to separate from each\r\nother, and the iron has entirely passed into the alpha modification,\r\nbut the particles are yet too small to be distinguishable under\r\nthe microscope. It also, possibly, contains some incompletely\r\ntransformed matter. Sorbite is softer and tougher than troostite,\r\nand is habitually associated with pearlite. Its components are\r\ntending to coagulate into pearlite, and will do so in a fairly\r\nshort time at temperatures near the lower critical, which heat will\r\nfurnish the necessary molecular freedom. The normal appearance,\r\nhowever, is the cloudy mass shown in Fig. 52.\r\n\r\nPearlite is a definite conglomerate of ferrite and cementite containing\r\nabout six parts of the former to one of the latter. When pure, it\r\nhas a carbon content of about 0.95 per cent. It represents the\r\ncomplete transformation of the eutectoid austenite accomplished by\r\nslow-cooling of an iron-carbon alloy through the transformation\r\nrange. (See Fig. 46.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Quenched high-carbon steel, polished,\r\netched and viewed at 100 magnifications. This structure is called\r\nmartensite and is desired when maximum hardness is essential. Photograph\r\nby H. S. Rawdon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Martensite (light needles) passing into\r\ntroosite (dark patches). 130 X. From a piece of eutectoid steel\r\nelectrically welded.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Sorbite (dark patches) passing into pearlite\r\n(wavy striations). Light Areas are Patches of Ferrite. 220 X. From\r\na piece of hypo-eutectoid steel electrically welded.]\r\n\r\nThese observations are competent to explain annealing and toughening\r\npractice. A quickly quenched carbon steel is mostly martensitic\r\nwhich, as noted, is a solid solution of beta iron and cementite,\r\nhard and brittle. Moderate reheating or annealing changes this\r\nstructure largely into troostite, which is a partly transformed\r\nmartensite, possessing much of the hardness of martensite, but with\r\na largely increased toughness and shock resistance. This toughness is\r\nthe chief characteristic of the next material in the transformation\r\nseries, sorbite, which is merely martensite wholly transformed into\r\na mixture of ultramicroscopic crystals of ferrite (alpha iron)\r\nand cementite (Fe3C).\r\n\r\n\"Tempering\" or \"drawing\" should be restricted to mean moderate\r\nreheating, up to about 350° C., forming troostitic steel. \"Toughening\"\r\nrepresents the practice of reheating hardened carbon steels from\r\n350° C. up to just below the lower critical, and forms sorbitic\r\nsteel; while \"annealing\" refers to a heating for grain size at\r\nor above the transformation ranges, followed by a slow cooling.\r\nAny of these operations not only allows the transformations from\r\naustenite to pearlite to proceed, but also relieves internal stresses\r\nin the steel.\r\n\r\nNormalizing is a heating like annealing, followed by a moderately\r\nrapid quench.\r\n\r\nJUDGING THE HEAT OF STEEL\r\n\r\nWhile the use of a pyrometer is of course the only way to have\r\naccurate knowledge as to the heat being used in either forging or\r\nhardening steels, a color chart will be of considerable assistance\r\nif carefully studied. These have been prepared by several of the\r\nsteel companies as a guide, but it must be remembered that the colors\r\nand temperatures given are only approximate, and can be nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Finding hardening heats with a magnet.]\r\n\r\n_The Magnet Test_.--The critical point can also be determined by\r\nan ordinary horse-shoe magnet. Touch the steel with a magnet during\r\nthe heating and when it reaches the temperature at which steel fails\r\nto attract the magnet, or in other words, loses its magnetism,\r\nthe critical point has been reached.\r\n\r\nFigures 53 and 54 show how these are used in practice.\r\n\r\nThe first (Fig. 53) shows the use of a permanent horse-shoe magnet\r\nand the second (Fig. 54) an electro-magnet consisting of an iron\r\nrod with a coil or spool magnet at the outer end. In either case\r\nthe magnet should not be allowed to become heated but should be\r\napplied quickly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Using electro-magnet to determine heat.]\r\n\r\nThe work is heated up slowly in the furnace and the magnet applied\r\nfrom time to time. The steel being heated will attract the magnet\r\nuntil the heat reaches the critical point. The magnet is applied\r\nfrequently and when the magnet is no longer attracted, the piece\r\nis at the lowest temperature at which it can be hardened properly.\r\nQuenching slightly above this point will give a tool of satisfactory\r\nhardness. The method applies only to carbon steels and will not\r\nwork for modern high-speed steels.\r\n\r\nHEAT TREATMENT OF GEAR BLANKS\r\n\r\nThis section is based on a paper read before the American Gear\r\nManufacturers' Association at White Sulphur Springs, W. Va., Apr.\r\n18, 1918.\r\n\r\nGreat advancement has been made in the heat treating and hardening of\r\ngears. In this advancement the chemical and metallurgical laboratory\r\nhave played no small part. During this time, however, the condition\r\nof the blanks as they come to the machine shop to be machined has\r\nnot received its share of attention.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct types of gears, both types having their\r\nchampions, namely, carburized and heat-treated. The difference\r\nbetween the two in the matter of steel composition is entirely in\r\nthe carbon content, the carbon never running higher than 25-point\r\nin the carburizing type, while in the heat-treated gears the carbon\r\nis seldom lower than 35-point. The difference in the final gear\r\nis the hardness. The carburized gear is file hard on the surface,\r\nwith a soft, tough and ductile core to withstand shock, while the\r\nheat-treated gear has a surface that can be touched by a file with\r\na core of the same hardness as the outer surface.\r\n\r\nANNEALING WORK.--With the exception of several of the higher types\r\nof alloy steels, where the percentages of special elements run quite\r\nhigh, which causes a slight air-hardening action, the carburizing\r\nsteels are soft enough for machining when air cooled from any\r\ntemperature, including the finishing temperature at the hammer.\r\nThis condition has led many drop-forge and manufacturing concerns\r\nto consider annealing as an unnecessary operation and expense.\r\nIn many cases the drop forging has only been heated to a low\r\ntemperature, often just until the piece showed color, to relieve\r\nthe so-called hammer strains. While this has been only a compromise\r\nit has been better than no reheating at all, although it has not\r\nproperly refined the grain, which is necessary for good machining\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAnnealing is heating to a temperature slightly above the highest\r\ncritical point and cooling slowly either in the air or in the furnace.\r\nAnnealing is done to accomplish two purposes: (1) to relieve mechanical\r\nstrains and (2) to soften and produce a maximum refinement of grain.\r\n\r\nPROCESS OF CARBURIZING.--Carburizing imparts a shell of high-carbon\r\ncontent to a low-carbon steel. This produces what might be termed\r\na \"dual\" steel, allowing for an outer shell which when hardened\r\nwould withstand wear, and a soft ductile core to produce ductility\r\nand withstand shock. The operation is carried out by packing the\r\nwork to be carburized in boxes with a material rich in carbon and\r\nmaintaining the box so charged at a temperature in excess of the\r\nhighest critical point for a length of time to produce the desired\r\ndepth of carburized zone. Generally maintaining the temperature\r\nat 1,650 to 1,700° F. for 7 hr. will produce a carburized zone\r\n1/32 in. deep.\r\n\r\nHeating to a temperature slightly above the highest critical point\r\nand cooling suddenly in some quenching medium, such as water or oil\r\nhardens the steel. This treatment produces a maximum refinement\r\nwith the maximum strength.\r\n\r\nDrawing to a temperature below the highest critical point (the\r\ntemperature being governed by the results required) relieves the\r\nhardening strains set up by quenching, as well as the reducing\r\nof the hardness and brittleness of hardened steel.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF PROPER ANNEALING.--Proper annealing of low-carbon steels\r\ncauses a complete solution or combination to take place between\r\nthe ferrite and pearlite, producing a homogeneous mass of small\r\ngrains of each, the grains of the pearlite being surrounded by\r\ngrains of ferrite. A steel of this refinement will machine to good\r\nadvantage, due to the fact that the cutting tool will at all times\r\nbe in contact with metal of uniform composition.\r\n\r\nWhile the alternate bands of ferrite and pearlite are microscopically\r\nsized, it has been found that with a Gleason or Fellows gear-cutting\r\nmachine that rough cutting can be traced to poorly annealed steels,\r\nhaving either a pronounced banded structure or a coarse granular\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE FOR ANNEALING.--Theoretically, annealing should be\r\naccomplished at a temperature at just slightly above the critical\r\npoint. However, in practice the temperature is raised to a higher\r\npoint in order to allow for the solution of the carbon and iron to\r\nbe produced more rapidly, as the time required to produce complete\r\nsolution is reduced as the temperature increases past the critical\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nFor annealing the simpler types of low-carbon steels the following\r\ntemperatures have been found to produce uniform machining conditions\r\non account of producing uniform fine-grain pearlite structure:\r\n\r\n0.15 to 0.25 per cent carbon, straight carbon steel.--Heat to 1,650°F.\r\nHold at this temperature until the work is uniformly heated; pull\r\nfrom the furnace and cool in air.\r\n\r\n0.15 to 0.25 per cent carbon, 1-1/2 per cent nickel, 1/2 per cent\r\nchromium steel.--Heat to 1,600°F. Hold at this temperature until\r\nthe work is uniformly heated; pull from the furnace and cool in air.\r\n\r\n0.15 to 0.25 per cent carbon, 3-1/2 per cent nickel steel.--Heat\r\nto 1,575°F. Hold at this temperature until the work is uniformly\r\nheated; pull from the furnace and cool in air.\r\n\r\nCARE IN ANNEALING.--Not only will benefits in machining be found\r\nby careful annealing of forgings but the subsequent troubles in\r\nthe hardening plant will be greatly reduced. The advantages in\r\nthe hardening start with the carburizing operation, as a steel of\r\nuniform and fine grain size will carburize more uniformly, producing\r\na more even hardness and less chances for soft spots. The holes in\r\nthe gears will also \"close in more uniformly,\" not causing some\r\ngears to require excessive grinding and others with just enough\r\nstock. Also all strains will have been removed from the forging,\r\neliminating to a great extent distortion and the noisy gears which\r\nare the result.\r\n\r\nWith the steels used, for the heat-treated gears, always of a higher\r\ncarbon content, treatment after forging is necessary for machining, as\r\nit would be impossible to get the required production from untreated\r\nforgings, especially in the alloy steels. The treatment is more\r\ndelicate, due to the higher percentage of carbon and the natural\r\nincrease in cementite together with complex carbides which are\r\npresent in some of the higher types of alloys.\r\n\r\nWhere poor machining conditions in heat-treated steels are present\r\nthey are generally due to incomplete solution of cementite rather\r\nthan bands of free ferrite, as in the case of case-hardening steels.\r\nThis segregation of carbon, as it is sometimes referred to, causes\r\nhard spots which, in the forming of the tooth, cause the cutter\r\nto ride over the hard metal, producing high spots on the face of\r\nthe tooth, which are as detrimental to satisfactory gear cutting\r\nas the drops or low spots produced on the face of the teeth when\r\nthe pearlite is coarse-grained or in a banded condition.\r\n\r\nIn the simpler carburized steels it is not necessary to test the\r\nforgings for hardness after annealing, but with the high percentages\r\nof alloys in the carburizing steels and the heat-treated steels\r\na hardness test is essential.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the best results in machining, the microstructure of the\r\nmetal should be determined and a hardness range set that covers\r\nthe variations in structure that produce good machining results.\r\nBy careful control of the heat-treating operation and with the aid\r\nof the Brinell hardness tester and the microscope it is possible\r\nto continually give forgings that will machine uniformly and be\r\nsoft enough to give desired production. The following gives a few\r\nof the hardness numerals on steel used in gear manufacture that\r\nproduce good machining qualities:\r\n\r\n0.20 per cent carbon, 3 per cent nickel, 1-1/4; per cent\r\nchromium--Brinell 156 to 170.\r\n\r\n0.50 per cent carbon, 3 per cent nickel, 1 per cent chromium--Brinell\r\n179 to 187.\r\n\r\n0.50 per cent carbon chrome-vanadium--Brinell 170 to 179.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF SIZE\r\n\r\nThe size of the piece influences the physical properties obtained in\r\nsteel by heat treatment. This has been worked out by E. J. Janitzky,\r\nmetallurgical engineer of the Illinois Steel Company, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Effect of size on heating.]\r\n\r\n\"With an increase in the mass of steel there is a corresponding\r\ndecrease in both the minimum surface hardness and depth hardness,\r\nwhen quenched from the same temperature, under identical conditions\r\nof the quenching medium. In other words, the physical properties\r\nobtained are a function of the surface of the metal quenched for\r\na given mass of steel. Keeping this primary assumption in mind, it\r\nis possible to predict what physical properties may be developed in\r\nheat treating by calculating the surface per unit mass for different\r\nshapes and sizes. It may be pointed out that the figures and chart\r\nthat follow are not results of actual tests, but are derived by\r\ncalculation. They indicate the mathematical relation, which, based\r\non the fact that the physical properties of steel are determined\r\nnot alone by the rate which heat is lost per unit of surface, but\r\nby the rate which heat is lost per unit of weight in relation to\r\nthe surface exposed for that unit. The unit of weight has for the\r\ndifferent shaped bodies and their sizes a certain surface which\r\ndetermines their physical properties.\r\n\r\n\"For example, the surface corresponding to 1 lb. of steel has been\r\ncomputed for spheres, rounds and flats. For the sphere with a unit\r\nweight of 1 lb. the portion is a cone with the apex at the center\r\nof the sphere and the base the curved surface of the sphere (surface\r\nexposed to quenching). For rounds, a unit weight of 1 lb. may be\r\ntaken as a disk or cylinder, the base and top surfaces naturally do\r\nnot enter into calculation. For a flat, a prismatic or cylindrical\r\nvolume may be taken to represent the unit weight. The surfaces\r\nthat are considered in this instance are the top and base of the\r\nsection, as these surfaces are the ones exposed to cooling.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of the calculations are as follows:\r\n\r\nTABLE 20.--SPHERE\r\n\r\n  Diameter      Surface per\r\n  of sphere    pound of steel\r\n     _X_            _Y_\r\n    8 in.       2.648 sq. in.\r\n    6 in.       3.531 sq. in.\r\n    4 in.       5.294 sq. in.\r\n    3 in.       7.062 sq. in.\r\n    2 in.      10.61  sq. in.\r\n_XY_ = 21.185.\r\n\r\nTABLE 21.--ROUND\r\n\r\n  Diameter      Surface per\r\n  of round     pound of steel\r\n    _X_             _Y_\r\n  8.0  in.      1.765 sq. in.\r\n  6.0  in.      2.354 sq. in.\r\n  5.0  in.      2.829 sq. in.\r\n  4.0  in.      3.531 sq. in.\r\n  3.0  in.      4.708 sq. in.\r\n  2.0  in.      7.062 sq. in.\r\n  1.0  in.     14.125 sq. in.\r\n  0.5  in.     28.25  sq. in.\r\n  0.25 in.     56.5   sq. in.\r\n_XY_ = 14.124.\r\n\r\nTABLE 22.--FLAT\r\n\r\n  Thickness     Surface per\r\n   of flat     pound of steel\r\n     _X_            _Y_\r\n  8.0  in.     0.8828 sq. in.\r\n  6.0  in.     1.177  sq. in.\r\n  5.0  in.     1.412  sq. in.\r\n  4.0  in.     1.765  sq. in.\r\n  3.0  in.     2.345  sq. in.\r\n  2.0  in.     3.531  sq. in.\r\n  1.0  in.     7.062  sq. in.\r\n  0.5  in.    14.124  sq. in.\r\n  0.25 in.    28.248 sq. in.\r\n_XY_ = 7.062.\r\n\r\nHaving once determined the physical qualities of a certain specimen,\r\nand found its position on the curve we have the means to predict the\r\ndecrease of physical qualities on larger specimens which receive\r\nthe same heat treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen the surfaces of the unit weight as outlined in the foregoing\r\ntables are plotted as ordinates and the corresponding diameters as\r\nabscissæ, the resulting curve is a hyperbola and follows the law\r\n_XY = C_. In making these calculations the radii or one-half of\r\nthe thickness need only to be taken into consideration as the heat\r\nis conducted from the center of the body to the surface, following\r\nthe shortest path.\r\n\r\nThe equations for the different shapes are as follows:\r\n\r\n  For flats   _XY_ =  7.062\r\n  For rounds  _XY_ = 14.124\r\n  For spheres _XY_ = 21.185\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the constants increase in a ratio of 1, 2,\r\nand 3, and the three bodies in question will increase in hardness\r\non being quenched in the same ratio, it being understood that the\r\ndiameter of the sphere and round and thickness of the flat are\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nRelative to shape, it is interesting to note that rounds, squares,\r\noctagons and other three axial bodies, with two of their axes equal,\r\nhave the same surface for the unit weight.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n      Size     Length    Surface      Weight    Surface for 1 lb.\r\n  2 in. Sq.    12 in.  96.0 sq. in.  13.60 lb.  7.06 sq. in.\r\n  2 in. Round  12 in.  75.4 sq. in.  10.68 lb.  7.06 sq. in.\r\n\r\nAlthough this discussion is at present based upon mathematical\r\nanalysis, it is hoped that it will open up a new field of investigation\r\nin which but little work has been done, and may assist in settling\r\nthe as yet unsolved question of the effect of size and shape in\r\nthe heat treatment of steel.\r\n\r\nHEAT-TREATING EQUIPMENT AND METHODS FOR MASS PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe heat-treating department of the Brown-Lipe-Chapin Company,\r\nSyracuse, N. Y., runs day and night, and besides handling all the\r\nhardening of tools, parts of jigs, fixtures, special machines and\r\nappliances, carburizes and heat-treats every month between 150,000\r\nand 200,000 gears, pinions, crosses and other components entering\r\ninto the construction of differentials for automobiles.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the steel really begins in the mill, where the\r\nsteel is made to conform to a specific formula. On the arrival\r\nof the rough forgings at the Brown-Lipe-Chapin factory, the first\r\nof a long series of inspections begins.\r\n\r\nANNEALING METHOD.--Forgings which are too hard to machine are put\r\nin pots with a little charcoal to cause a reducing atmosphere and\r\nto prevent scale. The covers are then luted on and the pots placed\r\nin the furnace. Carbon steel from 15 to 25 points is annealed at\r\n1,600°F. Nickel steel of the same carbon and containing in addition\r\n3-1/2 per cent nickel is annealed at 1,450°F. When the pots are\r\nheated through, they are rolled to the yard and allowed to cool.\r\nThis method of annealing gives the best hardness for quick machining.\r\n\r\nThe requirements in the machine operations are very rigid and, in\r\nspite of great care and probably the finest equipment of special\r\nmachines in the world, a small percentage of the product fails\r\nto pass inspection during or at the completion of the machine\r\noperations. These pieces, however, are not a loss, for they play\r\nan important part in the hardening process, indicating as they do\r\nthe exact depth of penetration of the carburizing material and\r\nthe condition of both case and core.\r\n\r\nHEAT-TREATING DEPARTMENT.--The heat-treating department occupies an\r\nL-shaped building. The design is very practical, with the furnace\r\nand the floor on the same level so that there is no lifting of\r\nheavy pots. Fuel oil is used in all the furnaces and gives highly\r\nsatisfactory results. The consumption of fuel oil is about 2 gal.\r\nper hour per furnace.\r\n\r\nThe work is packed in the pots in a room at the entrance to the\r\nheat-treatment building. Before packing, each gear is stamped with\r\na number which is a key to the records of the analysis and complete\r\nheat treatment of that particular gear. Should a question at any time\r\narise regarding the treatment of a certain gear, all the necessary\r\ninformation is available if the number on the gear is legible. For\r\ninstance, date of treatment, furnace, carburizing material, position\r\nof the pot in the furnace, position of gear in pot, temperature of\r\nfurnace and duration of treatment are all tabulated and filed for\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nAfter marking, all holes and parts which are to remain uncarburized\r\nare plugged or luted with a mixture of kaolin and Mellville gravel\r\nclay, and the gear is packed in the carburizing material. Bohnite,\r\na commercial carburizing compound is used exclusively at this plant.\r\nThis does excellent work and is economical. Broadly speaking, the\r\neconomy of a carburizing compound depends on its lightness. The\r\nspace not occupied by work must be filled with compound; therefore)\r\nother things being equal, a compound weighing 25 lb. would be worth\r\nmore than twice as much as one weighing 60 lb. per cubic foot. It\r\nhas been claimed that certain compounds can be used over and over\r\nagain, but this is only true in a limited way, if good work is\r\nrequired. There is, of course, some carbon in the compound after\r\nthe first use, but for first-class work, new compound must be used\r\neach time.\r\n\r\nTHE PACKING DEPARTMENT.--In Fig. 56 is shown the packing pots where\r\nthe work is packed. These are of malleable cast iron, with an internal\r\nvertical flange around the hole _A_. This fits in a bell on the\r\nend of the cast-iron pipe _B_, which is luted in position with\r\nfireclay before the packing begins. At _C_ is shown a pot ready\r\nfor packing. The crown gears average 10 to 12 in. in diameter and\r\nweigh about 11 lb. each. When placed in the pots, they surround\r\nthe central tube, which allows the heat to circulate. Each pot\r\ncontains five gears. Two complete scrap gears are in each furnace\r\n(_i.e._, gears which fail to pass machining inspection), and at\r\nthe top of front pot are two or more short segments of scrap gear,\r\nused as test pieces to gage depth of case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Packing department and special pots.]\r\n\r\nAfter filling to the top with compound, the lid _D_ is luted on.\r\nTen pots are then placed in a furnace. It will be noted that the\r\npots to the right are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, indicating the position\r\nthey are to occupy in the furnace.\r\n\r\nThe cast-iron ball shown at _E_ is small enough to drop through\r\nthe pipe _B_, but will not pass through the hole _A_ in the bottom\r\nof the pot. It is used as a valve to plug the bottom of the pot\r\nto prevent the carburizing compound from dropping through when\r\nremoving the carburized gears to the quenching bath.\r\n\r\nWithout detracting from the high quality of the work, the metallurgist\r\nin this plant has succeeded in cutting out one entire operation\r\nand reducing the time in the hardening room by about 24 hr.\r\n\r\nFormerly, the work was carburized at about 1,700°F. for 9 hr. The\r\npots were then run out into the yard and allowed to cool slowly.\r\nWhen cool, the work was taken out of the pots, reheated and quenched\r\nat 1,600°F. to refine the core. It was again reheated to 1,425°F.\r\nand quenched to refine the case. Finally, it was drawn to the proper\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nSHORT METHOD OF TREATMENT.--In the new method, the packed pots are\r\nrun into the case-hardening furnaces, which are heated to 1,600°F.\r\nOn the insertion of the cold pots, the temperature naturally falls.\r\nThe amount of this fall is dependent upon a number of variables,\r\nbut it averages nearly 500°F. as shown in the pyrometer chart,\r\nFig. 61. The work and furnace must be brought to 1,600°F. Within\r\n2-1/2 hr.; otherwise, a longer time will be necessary to obtain\r\nthe desired depth of case. On this work, the depth of case required\r\nis designated in thousandths, and on crown gears, the depth in\r\n0.028 in. Having brought the work to a temperature of 1,600°F.\r\nthe depth of case mentioned can be obtained in about 5-1/2 hr. by\r\nmaintaining this temperature.\r\n\r\nAs stated before, at the top of each pot are several test pieces\r\nconsisting of a whole scrap gear and several sections. After the\r\npots have been heated at 1,600°F. for about 5-1/4 hr., they are\r\nremoved, and a scrap-section test-piece is quenched direct from\r\nthe pot in mineral oil at _not more than_ 100°F. The end of a tooth\r\nof this is then ground and etched to ascertain the depth of case.\r\nAs these test pieces are of exactly the same cross-section as the\r\ngears themselves, the carburizing action is similar. When the depth\r\nof case has been found from the etched test pieces to be satisfactory,\r\nthe pots are removed. The iron ball then is dropped into the tube\r\nto seal the hole in the bottom of the pot; the cover and the tube\r\nare removed, and the gears quenched direct from the pot in mineral\r\noil, which is kept at a temperature not higher than 100°F.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT.--The heating at 1,600°F. gives the first heat treatment\r\nwhich refines the core, which under the former high heat (1,700°F.)\r\nwas rendered coarsely crystalline. All the gears, including the\r\nscrap gears, are quenched direct from the pot in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe gears then go to the reheating furnaces, situated in front of\r\na battery of Gleason quenching machines. These furnaces accommodate\r\nfrom 12 to 16 crown gears. The carbon-steel gears are heated in a\r\nreducing atmosphere to about 1,425°F. (depending on the carbon\r\ncontent) placed in the dies in the Gleason quenching machine, and\r\nquenched between dies in mineral oil at less than 100°F. The test\r\ngear receives exactly the same treatment as the others and is then\r\nbroken, giving a record of the condition of both case and core.\r\n\r\nAFFINITY OF NICKEL STEEL FOR CARBON.--The carbon- and nickel-steel\r\ngears are carburized separately owing to the difference in time\r\nnecessary for their carburization. Practically all printed information\r\non the subject is to the effect that nickel steel takes longer to\r\ncarburize than plain carbon steel. This is directly opposed to\r\nthe conditions found at this plant. For the same depth of case,\r\nother conditions being equal, a nickel-steel gear would require\r\nfrom 20 to 30 min. less than a low carbon-steel gear.\r\n\r\nFrom the quenching machines, the gears go to the sand-blasting\r\nmachines, situated in the wing of the heat-treating building, where\r\nthey are cleaned. From here they are taken to the testing department.\r\nThe tests are simple and at the same time most thorough.\r\n\r\nTESTING AND INSPECTION OF HEAT TREATMENT.--The hard parts of the\r\ngear must be so hard that a new mill file does not bite in the\r\nleast. Having passed this file test at several points, the gears go\r\nto the center-punch test. The inspector is equipped with a wooden\r\ntrough secured to the top of the bench to support the gear, a number\r\nof center punches (made of 3/4-in. hex-steel having points sharpened\r\nto an angle of 120 deg.) and a hammer weighing about 4 oz. With\r\nthese simple tools, supplemented by his skill, the inspector can\r\n_feel_ the depth and quality of the case and the condition of the\r\ncore. The gears are each tested in this way at several points on\r\nthe teeth and elsewhere, the scrap gear being also subjected to\r\nthe test. Finally, the scrap gear is securely clamped in the\r\nstraightening press shown in Fig. 57. With a 3-1/2-lb. hammer and\r\na suitable hollow-ended drift manipulated by one of Sandow's\r\nunderstudies, teeth are broken out of the scrap gear at various\r\npoints. These give a record confirming the center-punch tests,\r\nwhich, if the angle of the center punch is kept at 120 deg. and\r\nthe weight of the hammer and blow are uniform, is very accurate.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the center-punch test the ends of the teeth are peened\r\nlightly with a hammer. If they are too hard, small particles fly\r\noff. Such gears are drawn in oil at a temperature of from 300 to\r\n350°F., depending on their hardness. Some builders prefer to have\r\nthe extreme outer ends of the teeth drawn somewhat lower than the\r\nrest. This drawing is done on gas-heated red-hot plates, as shown\r\nat _A_ in Fig. 58.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Press for holding test gears for breaking.]\r\n\r\nNickel steel, in addition to all the tests given to carbon steel,\r\nis subjected to a Brinell test. For each steel, the temperature\r\nand the period of treatment are specific. For some unknown reason,\r\napparently like material with like treatment will, in isolated\r\ncases, not produce like results. It then remains for the treatment\r\nto be repeated or modified, but the results obtained during inspection\r\nform a valuable aid to the metallurgist in determining further\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE RECORDING AND REGULATION.--Each furnace is equipped\r\nwith pyrometers, but the reading and recording of all temperatures\r\nare in the hands of one man, who occupies a room with an opening\r\ninto the end of the hardening department. The opening is about 15\r\nft. above the floor level. On each side of it, easily legible from\r\nall of the furnaces, is a board with the numbers of the various\r\nfurnaces, as shown in Figs. 59 and 60. Opposite each furnace number\r\nis a series of hooks whereon are hung metal numbers representing the\r\npyrometer readings of the temperature in that particular furnace.\r\nWithin the room, as shown in Fig. 60, the indicating instrument\r\nis to the right, and to the left is a switchboard to connect it\r\nwith the thermo-couples in the various furnaces. The boards shown\r\nto the right and the left swing into the room, which enables the\r\nattendant easily to change the numbers to conform to the pyrometer\r\nreadings. Readings of the temperatures of the carburizing furnaces\r\nare taken and tabulated every ten minutes. These, numbered 1 to\r\n10, are shown on the board to the right in Fig. 59. The card shown\r\nin Fig. 61 gives such a record. These records are filed away for\r\npossible future reference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Gas heated drawing plate for tooth ends.]\r\n\r\nThe temperatures of the reheating furnaces, numbered from 1 to\r\n26 and shown on the board to the left in Fig. 59, are taken every\r\n5 min.\r\n\r\nEach furnace has a large metal sign on which is marked the temperature\r\nat which the furnace regulator is required to keep his heat. As\r\nsoon as any variation from this is posted on the board outside\r\nthe pyrometer room, the attendant sees it and adjusts the burners\r\nto compensate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Pyrometer recording room.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Inside of Pyrometer switch room.]\r\n\r\nDIES FOR GLEASON TEMPERING MACHINES.--In Fig. 62 is shown a set\r\nof dies for the Gleason tempering machine. These accurately made\r\ndies fit and hold the gear true during quenching, thus preventing\r\ndistortion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Carburizing furnace record.]\r\n\r\nReferring to Fig. 62, the die _A_ has a surface _B_ which fits the\r\nface of the teeth of the gear _C_. This surface is perforated by\r\na large number of holes which permit the quenching oil to circulate\r\nfreely. The die _A_ is set in the upper end of the plunger _A_\r\nof the tempering machine, shown in Fig. 63, a few inches above\r\nthe surface of the quenching oil in the tank _N_. Inside the die\r\n_A_ are the centering jaws _D_, Fig. 62, which are an easy fit\r\nfor the bore of the gear _C_. The inner surface of the centering\r\njaws is in the shape of a female cone. The upper die is shown at\r\n_E_. In the center (separate from it, but a snug sliding fit in\r\nit) is the expander _G_, which, during quenching, enters the taper\r\nin the centering jaws _D_, expanding them against the bore of the\r\ngear _C_. The faces _F_ of the upper die _E_ fit two angles at the\r\nback of the gear and are grooved for the passage of the quenching\r\noil. The upper die _E_ is secured to the die carrier _B_, shown in\r\nFig. 9, and inside the die is the expander _G_, which is backed\r\nup by compression springs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Dies for Gleason gear-hardening machine.]\r\n\r\nHARDENING OPERATION.--Hardening a gear is accomplished as follows:\r\nThe gear is taken from the furnace by the furnaceman and placed in\r\nthe lower die, surrounding the centering jaws, as shown at _H_ in\r\nFig. 62 and _C_ in Fig. 63. Air is then turned into the cylinder\r\n_D_, and the piston rod _E_, the die carrier _B_, the top die _F_\r\nand the expander _G_ descend. The pilot _H_ enters a hole in the\r\ncenter of the lower die, and the expander _G_ enters the centering\r\njaws _I_, causing them to expand and center the gear _C_ in the\r\nlower die. On further advance of the piston rod _E_, the expander\r\n_G_ is forced upward against the pressure of the springs _J_ and\r\nthe upper die _F_ comes in contact with the upper surface of the\r\ngear. Further downward movement of the dies, which now clamp the\r\nwork securely, overcomes the resistance of the pressure weight\r\n_K_ (which normally keeps up the plunger _A_), and the gear is\r\nsubmerged in the oil. The quenching oil is circulated through a\r\ncooling system outside the building and enters the tempering machine\r\nthrough the inlet pipe _L_. When the machine is in the position\r\nshown, the oil passes out through the ports _M_ in the lower plunger\r\nto the outer reservoir _N_, passing to the cooling system by way of\r\nthe overflow _O_. When the lower plunger _A_ is forced downward,\r\nthe ports _M_ are automatically closed and the cool quenching oil\r\nfrom the inlet pipe _L_, having no other means of escape, passes\r\nthrough the holes in the lower die and the grooves in the upper,\r\ncirculating in contact with the surfaces of the gear and passes to\r\nthe overflow. When the air pressure is released, the counterweights\r\nreturn the parts to the positions shown in Fig. 63, and the operator\r\nremoves the gear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Gleason tempering machine.]\r\n\r\nThe gear comes out uniformly hard all over and of the same degree of\r\nhardness as when tempered in an open tank. The output of the machine\r\ndepends on the amount of metal to be cooled, but will average from\r\n8 to 16 per hour. Each machine is served by one man, two furnaces\r\nbeing required to heat the work. A slight excess of oil is used\r\nin the firing of the furnaces to give a reducing atmosphere and\r\nto avoid scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Hardening and shrinking sleeves.]\r\n\r\nCARBURIZING LOW-CARBON SLEEVES.--Low-carbon sleeves are carburized\r\nand pushed on malleable-iron differential-case hubs. Formerly,\r\nthese sleeves were given two treatments after carburization in\r\norder to refine the case and the core, and then sent to the grinding\r\ndepartment, where they were ground to a push fit for the hubs. After\r\nthis they were pushed on the hubs. By the method now employed,\r\nthe first treatment refines the core, and on the second treatment,\r\nthe sleeves are pushed on the hub and at the same time hardened.\r\nThis method cuts out the internal grinding time, pressing on hubs,\r\nand haulage from one department to another. Also, less work is\r\nlost through splitting of the sleeves.\r\n\r\nThe machine for pushing the sleeves on is shown in Fig. 64. At\r\n_A_ is the stem on which the hot sleeve _B_ is to be pushed. The\r\ncarburized sleeves are heated in an automatic furnace, which takes\r\nthem cold at the back and feeds them through to the front, by which\r\ntime they are at the correct temperature. The loose mandrel _C_\r\nis provided with a spigot on the lower end, which fits the hole\r\nin the differential-case hub. The upper end is tapered as shown\r\nand acts as a pilot for the ram _D_. The action of pushing on and\r\nquenching is similar to the action of the Gleason tempering machine,\r\nwith the exception that water instead of oil is used as a quenching\r\nmedium. The speed of operation depends on a number of variables,\r\nbut from 350 to 500 can be heated and pressed on in 11 hr.\r\n\r\nCYANIDE BATH FOR TOOL STEELS.--All high-carbon tool steels are\r\nheated in a cyanide bath. With this bath, the heat can be controlled\r\nwithin 3 deg. The steel is evenly heated without exposure to the\r\nair, resulting in work which is not warped and on which there is no\r\nscale. The cyanide bath is, of course, not available for high-speed\r\nsteel because of the very high temperatures necessary.\r\n\r\nDROP FORGING DIES\r\n\r\nThe kind of steel used in the die of course influences the heat\r\ntreatment it is to receive, but this also depends on the kind of\r\nwork the die is to perform. If the die is for a forging which is\r\nmachined all over and does not have to be especially close to size,\r\nwhere a variation of 1/16 in. is not considered excessive, a low\r\ngrade steel will be perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn cases of fine work, however, where the variation cannot be over\r\n0.005 to 0.01 in. we must use a fine steel and prevent its going\r\nout of shape in the heating and quenching. A high quality crucible\r\nsteel is suggested with about the following analysis: Carbon 0.75\r\nper cent, manganese 0.25 per cent, silicon 0.15 per cent, sulphur\r\n0.015 per cent, and phosphorus 0.015 per cent. Such a steel will\r\nhave a decalescent point in the neighborhood of 1,355°F. and for\r\nthe size used, probably in a die of approximately 8 in., it will\r\nharden around 1,450°F.\r\n\r\nTo secure best results care must be taken at every step. The block\r\nshould be heated slowly to about 1,400°F., the furnace closed tight\r\nand allowed to cool slowly in the furnace itself. It should not\r\nsoak at the high temperature.\r\n\r\nAfter machining, and before it is put in the furnace for hardening,\r\nit should be slowly preheated to 800 or 900°F. This can be done in\r\nseveral ways, some putting the die block in front of the open door\r\nof a hardening furnace and keeping the furnace at about 1,000°F.\r\nThe main thing is to heat the die block very slowly and evenly.\r\n\r\nThe hardening heat should be very slow, 7 hr. being none too long\r\nfor such a block, bringing the die up gradually to the quenching\r\ntemperature of 1,450°. This should be held for 1/2 hr. or even a\r\nlittle more, when the die can be taken out and quenched. There\r\nshould be no guess work about the heating, a good pyrometer being\r\nthe only safe way of knowing the correct temperature.\r\n\r\nThe quenching tank should be of good size and have a spray or stream\r\nof water coming up near the surface. Dip the die block about 3 in.\r\ndeep and let the stream of water get at the face so as to play\r\non the forms. By leaving the rest of the die out of the water,\r\nmoving the die up and down a trifle to prevent a crack at the line\r\nof immersion, the back of the block is left tough while the face\r\nis very hard. To overcome the tendency to warp the face it is a\r\ngood plan to pour a little water on the back of the die as this\r\ntends to even up the cooling. The depth to which the die is dipped\r\ncan be easily regulated by placing bars across the tank at the\r\nproper depth.\r\n\r\nAfter the scleroscope shows the die to be properly hardened, which\r\nmeans from 98 to 101, the temper should be drawn as soon as convenient.\r\nA lead pot in which the back of the die can be suspended so as\r\nto heat the back side, makes a good method. Or the die block can\r\nbe placed back to the open door of a furnace. On a die of this\r\nsize it may take several hours to draw it to the desired temper.\r\nThis can be tested while warm by the scleroscope method, bearing\r\nin mind that the reading will not be the same as when cold. If\r\nthe test shows from 76 to 78 while warm, the hardness when cold\r\nwill be about 83, which is about right for this work.\r\n\r\nS. A. E. HEAT TREATMENTS\r\n\r\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers have adopted certain heat treatments\r\nto suit different steels and varying conditions.

This\r\nwas prepared by Thos. Firth & Sons, Ltd., Sheffield, England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Chart of changes due to heating and cooling.]\r\n\r\nThe center piece Fig. 65 represents a block of steel weighing about\r\n25 lb. The central hole accommodated a thermo-couple which was attached\r\nto an autographic recorder. The curve is a copy of the temperature\r\nrecord during heating and cooling. Into the holes in the side of\r\nthe block small pegs of overheated mild steel were inserted. One\r\npeg was withdrawn and quenched at each of the temperatures indicated\r\nby the numbered arrows, and after suitable preparation these pegs\r\nwere photographed in order to show the changes in structure taking\r\nplace during heating and cooling operations. The illustrations here\r\nreproduced are selected from those photographs with the object\r\nof presenting pictorially the changes involved in the refining of\r\noverheated steel or steel castings. Figures 66 to 79 with their\r\ncaptions show much that is of value to steel users.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--The structure of overheated mild steel\r\nfrom which all the pegs were made (magnified 25 diameters).

The bicycle era was the real beginning of\r\ntool making from a manufacturing standpoint, when interchangeable\r\ntools for rapid production were called for and toolmakers were in\r\ngreat demand. Even then, jigs, and fixtures were of the toolmaker's\r\nown design, who practically built every part of it from start to\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nThe old way, however, had to be changed. Instead of the toolmaker\r\nstarting his work from cutting off the stock in the old hack saw,\r\na place for cutting off stock was provided. If, for instance, a\r\nforming tool was wanted, the toolmaker was given the master tool\r\nto make while an apprentice roughed out the cutter. The toolmaker,\r\nhowever, reserved the hardening process for himself. That was one\r\nof the particular operations that the old toolmaker refused to\r\ngive up. It seemed preposterous to think for a minute that any\r\none else could possibly do that particular job without spoiling\r\nthe tools, or at least warp it out of shape (most of us did not\r\ngrind holes in cutters 15 to 20 years ago); or a hundred or more\r\nthings might happen unless the toolmaker did his own hardening\r\nand tempering.\r\n\r\nThat so many remarkably good tools were made at that time is still\r\na wonder to many, when we consider that the large shop had from 30\r\nto 40 different men, all using their own secret compounds, heating\r\nto suit eyesight, no matter if the day was bright or dark, and then\r\ntempering to color. But the day of the old toolmaker has changed.\r\nNow a tool is designed by a tool designer, O.K.'d, and then a print\r\ngoes to the foreman of the tool department, who specifies the size\r\nand gets the steel from the cutting-off department. After finishing\r\nthe machine work it goes to the hardening room, and this is the\r\nproblem we shall now take up in detail.\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN HARDENING ROOM.--A hardening room of today means a very\r\ndifferent place from the dirty, dark smithshop in the corner with\r\nthe open coal forge. There, when we wanted to be somewhat particular,\r\nwe sometimes shoveled the coal cinders to one side and piled a great\r\npile of charcoal on the forge. We now have a complete equipment;\r\na gas- or oil-heating furnace, good running water, several sizes\r\nof lead pots, and an oil tank large enough to hold a barrel of\r\noil. By running water, we mean a large tank with overflow pipes\r\ngiving a constant supply. The ordinary hardening room equipment\r\nshould consist of:\r\n\r\n  Gas or oil muffle furnace for hardening.\r\n  Gas or oil forge furnace.\r\n  A good size gas or oil furnace for annealing and case-hardening.\r\n  A gas or oil furnace to hold lead pots.\r\n  Oil tempering tank, gas- or oil-heated.\r\n  Pressure blower.\r\n  Large oil tank to hold at least a barrel of oil.\r\n  Big water tank with screen trays connected with large pipe from bottom\r\n    with overflow.\r\n  Straightening press.\r\n  The furnace should be connected with pyrometers and tempering tank with\r\n    a thermometer.\r\n\r\nBeside all this you need a good man. It does not make much difference\r\nhow completely the hardening department is fitted up, if you expect\r\ngood work, a small percentage of loss and to be able to tackle anything\r\nthat comes along, you must have a good man, one who understands\r\nthe difference between low- and high-carbon steel, who knows when\r\nparticular care must be exercised on particular work. In other\r\nwords, a man who knows how his work should be done, and has the\r\nintelligence to follow directions on treatments of steel on which\r\nhe has had no experience.\r\n\r\nJewelers' tools, especially for silversmith's work, probably have\r\nto stand the greatest punishment of any all-steel tools and to\r\nmake a spoon die so hard that it will not sink under a blow from\r\nan 1,800-lb. hammer with a 4-ft. drop, and still not crack, demands\r\ncareful treatment.\r\n\r\nTo harden such dies, first cover the impression on the die with\r\npaste made from bone dust or lampblack and oil. Place face down\r\nin an iron box partly filled with crushed charcoal, leaving back\r\nof die uncovered so that the heat can be seen at all times. Heat\r\nslowly in furnace to a good cherry red. The heat depends on the\r\nquality and the analysis of steel and the recommended actions of\r\nthe steel maker should be carefully followed. When withdrawn from\r\nthe fire the die should be quenched as shown in Fig. 80 with the\r\nface of die down and the back a short distance out of the water.\r\nWhen the back is black, immerse all over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Quenching a die, face down.]\r\n\r\nIf such a tank is not at hand, it would pay to rig one up at once,\r\nalthough a barrel of brine may be used, or the back of the die\r\nmay be first immersed to a depth of about 1/2 in. When the piece\r\nis immersed, hold die on an angle as in Fig. 81.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Hold die at angle to quench.]\r\n\r\nThis is for the purpose of expelling all steam bubbles as they\r\nform in contact with hot steel. We are aware of the fact that a\r\ngreat many toolmakers in jewelry shops still cling to the overhead\r\nbath, as in Fig. 82, but more broken pieces and more dies with\r\nsoft spots are due to this method than to all the others combined,\r\nas the water strikes one spot in force, contracting the surface\r\nso much faster than the rest of the die that the results are the\r\nsame as if an uneven heating had been given the steel.\r\n\r\nTAKE TIME FOR HARDENING.--Uneven heating and poor quenching has\r\ncaused loss of many very valuable dies, and it certainly seems\r\nthat when a firm spends from $75 to $450 in cutting a die that\r\na few hours could be spared for proper hardening. But the usual\r\nfeeling is that a tool must be hurried as soon as the hardener\r\ngets it, and if a burst die is the result from either uneven or\r\noverheated steel and quenching same without judgment, the steel\r\ngets the blame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--An obsolete method.]\r\n\r\nGive the steel a chance to heat properly, mix a little common sense\r\nwith \"your 30 years experience on the other fellows steel.\" Remember\r\nthat high-carbon steel hardens at a lower heat than low-carbon\r\nsteel, and quench when at the right heat in the two above ways,\r\nand 99 per cent of the trouble will vanish.\r\n\r\nWhen a die flies to pieces in quenching, don't rush to the\r\nsuperintendent with a \"poor-steel\" story, but find out first why it\r\nbroke so that the salesman who sold it will not be able to harden\r\npiece after piece from the same bar satisfactorily. If you find\r\na \"cold short,\" commonly called \"a pipe,\" you can lay the blame\r\non the steelmaker. If it is a case of overheating and quenching\r\nwhen too hot, you will find a coarse grain with many bright spots\r\nlike crystals to the hardening depth. If uneven heating is the\r\ncause, you will find a wider margin of hardening depth on one side\r\nthan on the other, or find the coarse grain from over-heating on\r\none side while on the other you will find a close grain, which\r\nmay be just right. If you find any other faults than a \"pipe,\"\r\nor are not able to harden deep enough, then take the blame like\r\na man and send for information. The different steel salesmen are\r\ngood fellows and most of them know a thing or two about their own\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFor much work a cooling bath at from 50 to 75°F. is very good both\r\nfor small hobs, dies, cutter plates or plungers. Some work will\r\nharden best in a barrel of brine, but in running cold water, splendid\r\nresults will be obtained. Cutter plates should always be dipped\r\ncorner first and if any have stripper holes, they should first\r\nbe plugged with asbestos or fire clay cement.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that the best hardening temperature for\r\ncarbon steel is the lowest temperature at which it will harden\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nCARBON IN TOOL STEEL\r\n\r\nCarbon tool steel, or \"tool steel\" as it is commonly called, usually\r\ncontains from 80 to 125 points (or from 0.80 to 1.25 per cent)\r\nof carbon, and none of the alloys which go to make up the high\r\nspeed steels. This was formerly known also as crucible or \"cast\"\r\nsteel, or crucible cast steel, from the way in which it was made.\r\nThis was before the days of steel castings. The advent of these\r\ncaused so much confusion that the term was soon dropped. When we\r\nsay \"tool steel,\" we nearly always refer to carbon-tool steel,\r\nhigh-speed steel being usually designated by that name.\r\n\r\nFor many purposes carbon-steel cutters are still found best, although\r\nwhere a large amount of material is to be removed at a rapid rate,\r\nit has given way to high-speed steels.\r\n\r\nCARBON STEELS FOR DIFFERENT TOOLS\r\n\r\nAll users of tool steels should carefully study the different qualities\r\nof the steels they handle. Different uses requires different kinds of\r\nsteel for best results, and for the purpose of designating different\r\nsteels some makers have adopted the two terms \"temper,\" and \"quality,\"\r\nto distinguish between them.\r\n\r\nIn this case temper refers to the amount of carbon which is combined\r\nwith the iron to make the metal into a steel. The quality means\r\nthe absence of phosphorous, sulphur and other impurities, these\r\ndepending on the ores and the methods of treatment.\r\n\r\nSteel makers have various ways of designating carbon steels for\r\ndifferent purposes. Some of these systems involve the use of numbers,\r\nthat of the Latrobe Steel Company being given herewith. It will\r\nbe noted that the numbers are based on 20 points of carbon per\r\nunit. The names given the different tempers are also of interest.\r\nOther makers use different numbers.\r\n\r\nThe temper list follows:\r\n\r\n    LATROBE TEMPER LIST OF CARBON TOOL STEELS\r\n  No. 3     temper 0.60 to 0.69 per cent carbon\r\n  No. 3-1/2 temper 0.70 to 0.79 per cent carbon\r\n  No. 4     temper 0.80 to 0.89 per cent carbon\r\n  No. 4-1/2 temper 0.90 to 0.99 pet cent carbon\r\n  No. 5     temper 1.00 to 1.09 per cent carbon\r\n  No. 5-1/2 temper 1.10 to 1.19 per cent carbon\r\n  No. 6     temper 1.20 to 1.29 per cent carbon\r\n  No. 6-1/2 temper 1.30 to 1.39 per cent carbon\r\n  No. 7     temper 1.40 to 1.49 per cent carbon\r\n\r\nUSES OF THE VARIOUS TEMPERS OF CARBON TOOL STEEL\r\n\r\nDIE TEMPER.--No. 3: All kinds of dies for deep stamping, pressing\r\nand drop forgings.

Not weldable.\r\n\r\nSTEEL FOR CHISELS AND PUNCHES\r\n\r\nThe highest grades of carbon or tempering steels are to be recommended\r\nfor tools which have to withstand shocks, such as for cold chisels\r\nor punches. These steels are, however, particularly useful where\r\nit is necessary to cut tempered or heat-treated steel which is\r\nmore than ordinarily hard, for cutting chilled iron, etc. They are\r\nuseful for boring, for rifle-barrel drilling, for fine finishing\r\ncuts, for drawing dies for brass and copper, for blanking dies for\r\nhard materials, for formed cutters on automatic screw machines\r\nand for roll-turning tools.\r\n\r\nSteel of this kind, being very dense in structure, should be given\r\nmore time in heating for forging and for hardening, than carbon\r\nsteels of a lower grade. For forging it should be heated slowly\r\nand uniformly to a bright red and only light blows used as the\r\nheat dies out. Do not hammer at all at a black heat. Reheat slowly\r\nto a dark red for hardening and quench in warm water. Grind on a\r\nwet grindstone.\r\n\r\nWhere tools have to withstand shocks and vibration, as in pneumatic\r\nhammer work, in severe punching duty, hot or cold upsetting or\r\nsimilar work, tool steels containing vanadium or chrome-vanadium\r\ngive excellent results. These are made particularly for work of\r\nthis kind.\r\n\r\nCHISELS-SHAPES AND HEAT TREATMENT[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Abstract of paper by HENRY FOWLER, chief mechanical\r\nengineer of the Midland Ry., England, before the Institution of\r\nMechanical Engineers.]\r\n\r\nIn the chief mechanical engineer's department of the Midland Ry.,\r\nafter considerable experimenting, it was decided to order chisel\r\nsteel to the following specifications: carbon, 0.75 to 0.85 per\r\ncent, the other constituents being normal. This gives a complete\r\nanalysis as follows: carbon, 0.75 to 0.85; manganese, 0.30; silicon,\r\n0.10; sulphur, 0.025; phosphorus, 0.025.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of a chisel which had given excellent service was as\r\nfollows: carbon, 0.75; manganese, 0.38; silicon, 0.16; sulphur,\r\n0.028; phosphorus, 0.026. The heat treatment is unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Forms of chisels standardized for the\r\nlocomotive shops of the Midland Ry., England.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that chisel steel was standardized, the form of\r\nthe chisels themselves was revised, and a standard chart of these\r\nas used in the locomotive shops was drawn up. Figure 83 shows the\r\nmost important forms, which are made to stock orders in the smithy\r\nand forwarded to the heat-treatment room where the hardening and\r\ntempering is carried out on batches of fifty. A standard system\r\nof treatment is employed, which to a very large extent does away\r\nwith the personal element. Since the chemical composition is more\r\nor less constant, the chief variant is the section which causes\r\nthe temperatures to be varied slightly. The chisels are carefully\r\nheated in a gas-fired furnace to a temperature of from 730 to 740°C.\r\n(1,340 to 1,364°F.) according to section. In practice, the first\r\nchisel, is heated to 730°C.; and the second to 735°C. (1,355°F.);\r\nand a 1 in. half round chisel to 740°C., because of their varying\r\nincreasing thickness of section at the points. Upon attaining this\r\nsteady temperature, the chisels are quenched to a depth of 3/8\r\nto 1/2 in. from the point in water, and then the whole chisel is\r\nimmersed and cooled off in a tank containing linseed oil.\r\n\r\nThe oil-tank is cooled by being immersed in a cold-water tank through\r\nwhich water is constantly circulated. After this treatment, the\r\nchisels have a dead hard point and a tough or sorbitic shaft. They\r\nare then tempered or the point \"let down.\" This is done by immersing\r\nthem in another oil-bath which has been raised to about 215°C.\r\n(419°F). The first result is, of course, to drop the temperature\r\nof the oil, which is gradually raised to its initial point. On\r\napproaching this temperature the chisels are taken out about every\r\n2°C. rise and tested with a file, and at a point between 215 and\r\n220°C. (428°F.), when it is found that the desired temper has been\r\nreached, the chisels are removed, cleaned in sawdust, and allowed\r\nto cool in an iron tray.\r\n\r\nNo comparative tests of these chisels with those bought and treated\r\nby the old rule-of-thumb methods have been made, as no exact method of\r\ncarrying out such tests mechanically, other than trying the hardness\r\nby the Brinell or scleroscope method, are known; any ordinary test\r\ndepends so largely upon the dexterity of the operator. The universal\r\nopinion of foremen and those using the chisels as to the advantages\r\nof the ones receiving the standard treatment described is that\r\na substantial improvement has been made. The chisels were not\r\n\"normalized.\" Tests of chisels normalized at about 900°C. (1,652°F.)\r\nshowed that they possessed no advantage.\r\n\r\nTools or pieces which have holes or deep depressions should be\r\nfilled before heating unless it is necessary to have the holes\r\nhard on the inside. In that case the filling would keep the water\r\naway from the surface and no hardening would take place. Where\r\nfilling is to be done, various materials are used by different\r\nhardeners. Fireclay and common putty seem to be favored by many.\r\n\r\nEvery mechanic who has had anything to do with the hardening of\r\ntools knows how necessary it is to take a cut from the surface of\r\nthe bar that is to be hardened. The reason is that in the process\r\nof making the steel its outer surface has become decarbonized.\r\nThis change makes it low-carbon steel, which will of course not\r\nharden. It is necessary to remove from 1/16 to 1/4 in. of diameter\r\non bars ranging from 1/2 to 4 in.\r\n\r\nThis same decarbonization occurs if the steel is placed in the\r\nforge in such a way that unburned oxygen from the blast can get at\r\nit. The carbon is oxidized, or burned out, converting the outside\r\nof the steel into low-carbon steel. The way to avoid this is to use\r\na deep fire. Lack of this precaution is the cause of much spoiled\r\nwork, not only because of decarbonization of the outer surface\r\nof the metal, but because the cold blast striking the hot steel\r\nacts like boiling hot water poured into an ice-cold glass tumbler.\r\nThe contraction sets up stresses that result in cracks when the\r\npiece is quenched.\r\n\r\nPREVENTING DECARBONIZATION OF TOOL STEEL\r\n\r\nIt is especially important to prevent decarbonization in such tools\r\nas taps and form cutters, which must keep their shape after hardening\r\nand which cannot be ground away on the profile. For this reason\r\nit is well to put taps, reamers and the like into pieces of pipe\r\nin heating them. The pipe need be closed on one end only, as the\r\nair will not circulate readily unless there is an opening at both\r\nends.\r\n\r\nEven if used in connection with a blacksmith's forge the lead bath\r\nhas an advantage for heating tools of complicated shapes, since\r\nit is easier to heat them uniformly and they are submerged and\r\naway from the air. The lead must be stirred frequently or the heat\r\nis not uniform in all parts of the lead bath. Covering the lead\r\nwith powdered charcoal will largely prevent oxidization and waste\r\nof lead.\r\n\r\nSuch a bath is good for temperatures between 620 and 1,150°F. At\r\nhigher temperatures there is much waste of lead.\r\n\r\nANNEALING TO RELIEVE INTERNAL STRESSES\r\n\r\nWork quenched from a high temperature and not afterward tempered\r\nwill, if complex in shape, contain many internal stresses which may\r\nlater cause it to break. They may be eased off by slight heating\r\nwithout materially lessening the hardness of the piece. One way\r\nto do this is to hold the piece over a fire and test it with a\r\nmoistened finger. Another way is to dip the piece in boiling water\r\nafter it has first been quenched in a cold bath. Such steps are\r\nnot necessary with articles which will afterward be tempered and\r\nin which the strains are thus reduced.\r\n\r\nIn annealing steels the operation is similar to hardening, as far\r\nas heating is concerned. The critical temperatures are the proper\r\nones for annealing as well as hardening. From this point on there\r\nis a difference, for annealing consists in cooling as slowly as\r\npossible. The slower the cooling the softer will be the steel.\r\n\r\nAnnealing may be done in the open air, in furnaces, in hot ashes\r\nor lime, in powdered charcoal, in burnt bone, in charred leather\r\nand in water. Open-air annealing will do as a crude measure in\r\ncases where it is desired to take the internal stresses out of\r\na piece. Care must be taken in using this method that the piece\r\nis not exposed to drafts or placed on some cold substance that\r\nwill chill it. Furnace annealing is much better and consists in\r\nheating the piece in a furnace to the critical temperature and\r\nthen allowing the work and the furnace to cool together.\r\n\r\nWhen lime or ashes are used as materials to keep air away from\r\nthe steel and retain the heat, they should be first heated to make\r\nsure that they are dry. Powdered charcoal is used for high-grade\r\nannealing, the piece being packed in this substance in an iron box\r\nand both the work and the box raised to the critical temperature\r\nand then allowed to cool slowly. Machinery steel may be annealed in\r\nspent ground-bone that has been used in casehardening; _but tool\r\nsteel must never be annealed in this way_, as it will be injured\r\nby the phosphorus contained in the bone. Charred leather is the\r\nbest annealing material for high-carbon steel, because it prevents\r\ndecarbonizing taking place.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE ANNEALING\r\n\r\nWater annealing consists in heating the piece, allowing it to cool\r\nin air until it loses its red heat and becomes black and then\r\nimmediately quenching it in water. This plan works well for very\r\nlow-carbon steel; but for high-carbon steel what is known as the\r\n\"double annealing treatment\" must be given, provided results are\r\nwanted quickly. The process consists in heating the steel quickly to\r\n200° or more above the upper critical, cooling in air down through\r\nthe recalescence point, then reheating it to just above the critical\r\npoint and again cooling slowly through the recalescence, then quenching\r\nin oil. This process retains in the steel a fine-grained structure\r\ncombined with softness.\r\n\r\nQUENCHING TOOL STEEL\r\n\r\nTo secure proper hardness, the cooling of quenching of steel is\r\nas important as its heating. Quenching baths vary in nature, there\r\nbeing a large number of ways to cool a piece of steel in contrast\r\nto the comparatively few ways of heating it.\r\n\r\nPlain water, brine and oil are the three most common quenching\r\nmaterials. Of these three the brine will give the most hardness,\r\nand plain water and oil come next. The colder that any of these\r\nbaths is when the piece is put into it the harder will be the steel;\r\nbut this does not mean that it is a good plan to dip the heated\r\nsteel into a tank of ice water, for the shock would be so great\r\nthat the bar would probably fly to pieces. In fact, the quenching\r\nbath must be sometimes heated a bit to take off the edge of the\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nBrine solutions will work uniformly, or give the same degree of\r\nhardness, until they reach a temperature of 150°F. above which\r\ntheir grip relaxes and the metals quenched in them become softer.\r\nPlain water holds its grip up to a temperature of approximately\r\n100°F.; but oil baths, which are used to secure a slower rate of\r\ncooling, may be used up to 500° or more. A compromise is sometimes\r\neffected by using a bath consisting of an inch or two of oil floating\r\non the surface of water. As the hot steel passes through the oil,\r\nthe shock is not as severe as if it were to be thrust directly\r\ninto the water; and in addition, oil adheres to the tool and keeps\r\nthe water from direct contact with the metal.\r\n\r\nThe old idea that mercury will harden steel more than any other\r\nquenching material has been exploded. A bath consisting of melted\r\ncyanide of potassium is useful for heating fine engraved dies and\r\nother articles that are required to come out free from scale. One\r\nmust always be careful to provide a hood or exhaust system to get\r\nrid of the deadly fumes coming from the cyanide pot.\r\n\r\nThe one main thing to remember in hardening tool steel is to quench\r\non a rising heat. This does not mean a rapid heating as a slow\r\nincrease in temperature is much better in every way.\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF TEMPERING.--Steel that has been hardened is generally\r\nharder and more brittle than is necessary, and in order to bring\r\nit to the condition that meets our requirements a treatment called\r\ntempering is used. This increases the toughness of the steel, _i.e._,\r\ndecrease the brittleness at the expense of a slight decrease in\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\nThere are several theories to explain this reaction, but generally\r\nit is only necessary to remember that in hardening we quench steel\r\nfrom the austenite phase, and, due to this rapid cooling, the normal\r\nchange from austenite to the eutectoid composition does not have\r\ntime to take place, and as a consequence the steel exists in a\r\npartially transformed, unstable and very hard condition at atmospheric\r\ntemperatures. But owing to the internal rigidity which exists in\r\ncold metal the steel is unable to change into its more stable phase\r\nuntil atoms can rearrange themselves by the application of heat.\r\nThe higher the heat, the greater the transformation into the softer\r\nphases. As the transformation takes place, a certain amount of heat\r\nof reaction, which under slow cooling would have been released in\r\nthe critical range, is now released and helps to cause a further\r\nslight reaction.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of steel is heated to a certain temperature and held\r\nthere, the tempering color, instead of remaining unchanged at this\r\ntemperature, will advance in the tempering-color scale as it would\r\nwith increasing temperature. This means that the tempering colors\r\ndo not absolutely correspond to the temperatures of steels, but the\r\nvariations are so slight that we can use them in actual practice.\r\n(See Table 23, page 158.)\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURES TO USE.--As soon as the temperature of the steel reaches\r\n100°C. (212°F.) the transformation begins, increasing in intensity\r\nas the temperature is raised, until finally when the lower critical\r\nrange is reached, the steel has been all changed into the ordinary\r\nconstituents of unhardened steels.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of polished steel is heated in an ordinary furnace, a\r\nthin film of oxides will form on its surface. The colors of this\r\nfilm change with temperature, and so, in tempering, they are generally\r\nused as an indication of the temperature of the steel. The steel\r\nshould have at least one polished face so that this film of oxides\r\nmay be seen.\r\n\r\nAn alternative method to the determination of temper by color is\r\nto temper by heating in an oil or salt bath. Oil baths can be used\r\nup to temperatures of 500°F.; above this, fused-salt baths are\r\nrequired. The article to be tempered is put into the bath, brought\r\nup to and held at the required temperature for a certain length\r\nof time, and then cooled, either rapidly or slowly. This takes\r\nlonger than the color method, but with low temperatures the results\r\nare more satisfactory, because the temperature of the bath can\r\nbe controlled with a pyrometer. The tempering temperatures given\r\nin the following table are taken from a handbook issued by the\r\nMidvale Steel Company.\r\n\r\nTABLE 23.--TEMPERING TEMPERATURES FOR STEELS\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature  |            |  Temperature  |\r\n   for 1 hr.   |            |   for 8 min.  |\r\n---------------|   Color    |---------------|             Uses\r\nDeg.

For\r\nthe finest work the longer time is preferable, while for ordinary\r\nrough work 8 min. is sufficient, after the steel has reached the\r\nspecified temperature.\r\n\r\nThe rate of cooling after tempering seems to be immaterial, and\r\nthe piece can be cooled at any rate, providing that in large pieces\r\nit is sufficiently slow to prevent strains.\r\n\r\nKNOWING WHAT TAKES PLACE.--How are we to know if we have given a\r\npiece of steel the very best possible treatment?\r\n\r\nThe best method is by microscopic examination of polished and etched\r\nsections, but this requires a certain expense for laboratory equipment\r\nand upkeep, which may prevent an ordinary commercial plant from\r\nattempting such a refinement. It is highly recommended that any\r\nfirm that has any large amount of heat treatment to do, install\r\nsuch an equipment, which can be purchased for from $250 to $500.\r\nIts intelligent use will save its cost in a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe other method is by examination of fractures of small test bars.\r\nSteel heated to its correct temperatures will show the finest possible\r\ngrain, whereas underheated steel has not had its grain structure\r\nrefined sufficiently, and so will not be at its best. On the other\r\nhand, overheated steel will have a coarser structure, depending\r\non the extent of overheating.\r\n\r\nTo determine the proper quenching temperature of any particular\r\ngrade of steel it is only necessary to heat pieces to various\r\ntemperatures not more than 20°C. (36°F.) apart, quench in water,\r\nbreak them, and examine the fractures. The temperature producing\r\nthe finest grain should be used for annealing and hardening.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to determine tempering temperatures, several pieces\r\nshould be hardened, then tempered to various degrees, and cooled\r\nin air. Samples, say six, reheated to temperatures varying by 100°\r\nfrom 300 to 800°C. will show a considerable range of properties,\r\nand the drawing temperature of the piece giving the desired results\r\ncan be used.\r\n\r\nFor drawing tempers up to 500°F. oil baths of fresh cotton seed\r\noil can be safely and satisfactorily used. For higher temperature\r\na bath of some kind of fused salt is recommended.\r\n\r\nHINTS FOR TOOL STEEL USERS\r\n\r\nDo not hesitate to ask for information from the maker as to the\r\nbest steel to use for a given purpose, mentioning in as much detail\r\nas possible the use for which it is intended.\r\n\r\nDo not heat the steel to a higher degree than that fixed in the\r\ndescription of each class. Never heat the steel to more than a\r\ncherry red without forging it or giving it a definite heat treatment.\r\nHeating steel at even moderate temperature is liable to coarsen the\r\ngrain which can only be restored by forging or by heat treating.\r\n\r\nLet the forging begin as soon as the steel is hot enough and never\r\nlet tool steel soak in the fire. Continue the hammering vigorously\r\nand constantly, using lighter blows as it cools off, and stopping\r\nwhen the heat becomes a very dull red or a faint brown.\r\n\r\nShould welding be necessary care should be taken not to overheat\r\nin order to make an easy weld. Keep it below the sparkling point\r\nas this indicates that the steel is burnt.\r\n\r\nBegin to forge as soon as the welds are put together, taking care\r\nto use gentle strokes at first increasing them as the higher heat\r\nfalls, but not overdoing the hammering when the steel cools. The\r\nhammering should be extended beyond the welding point and should\r\ncontinue until the dull red or brown heat is reached.\r\n\r\nPREVENTING CRACKS IN HARDENING\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith in the small shop, where equipment is usually very\r\nlimited, often consisting of a forge, a small open hard-coal furnace,\r\na barrel of water and a can of oil must have skill and experience.\r\nWith this equipment the smith is expected to, and usually can,\r\nproduce good results if proper care is taken.\r\n\r\nIn hardening carbon tool steel in water, too much cannot be said in\r\nfavor of slow, careful heating, nor against overheating if cracks\r\nare to be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is not wise to take the work from the hardening bath and leave\r\nit exposed to the air if there is any heat left in it, because\r\nit is more liable to crack than if left in the bath until cold.\r\nIn heating, plenty of time is taken for the work to heat evenly\r\nclear through, thus avoiding strains caused by quick and improper\r\nheating, In quenching in water, contraction is much more rapid\r\nthan was the expansion while heating, and strains begin the moment\r\nthe work touches the water. If the piece has any considerable size\r\nand is taken from the bath before it is cold and allowed to come to\r\nthe air, expansion starts again from the inside so rapidly that the\r\nchilled hardened surface cracks before the strains can be relieved.\r\n\r\nMany are most successful with the hardening bath about blood warm.\r\nWhen the work that is being hardened is nearly cold, it is taken\r\nfrom the water and instantly put into a can of oil, where it is\r\nallowed to finish cooling. The heat in the body of the tool will\r\ncome to the surface more slowly, thus relieving the strain and\r\novercoming much of the danger of cracking.\r\n\r\nSome contend that the temper should be drawn as soon as possible\r\nafter hardening: but that if this cannot be done for some hours, the\r\nwork should be left in the oil until the tempering can be done. It\r\nis claimed that forming dies and punch-press dies that are difficult\r\nto harden will seldom crack if treated in this way.\r\n\r\nSmall tools or pieces that are very troublesome because of peculiar\r\nshape should be made of steel which has been thoroughly annealed.\r\nIt is often well to mill or turn off the outer skin of the bar,\r\nto remove metal which has been cold-worked. Then heat slowly just\r\nthrough the critical range and cool in the furnace, in order to\r\nproduce a very fine grain. Tools machined from such stock, and\r\nhardened with the utmost care, will have the best chance to survive\r\nwithout warping, growth or cracking.\r\n\r\nSHRINKING AND ENLARGING WORK\r\n\r\nSteel can be shrunk or enlarged by proper heating and cooling.\r\nPins for forced fits can be enlarged several thousandths of an\r\ninch by rapid heating to a dull red and quenching in water. The\r\ntheory is that the metal is expanded in heating and that the sudden\r\ncooling sets the outer portion before the core can contract. In\r\ndipping the piece is not held under water till cold but is dipped,\r\nheld a moment and removed. Then dipped again and again until cold.\r\n\r\nRings and drawing dies are also shrunk in a similar way. The rings\r\nare slowly heated to a cherry red, slipped on a rod and rolled\r\nin a shallow pan of water which cools only the outer edge. This\r\nholds the outside while the inner heated portion is forced inward,\r\nreducing the hole. This operation can be repeated a number of times\r\nwith considerable success.\r\n\r\nTEMPERING ROUND DIES\r\n\r\nA number of circular dies of carbon tool steel for use in tool\r\nholders of turret lathes were required. No proper tempering oven\r\nwas available, so the following method was adopted and proved quite\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAfter the dies had been hardened dead hard in water, they were\r\ncleaned up bright. A pair of ordinary smiths' tongs was made with\r\njaws of heavy material and to fit nicely all around the outside of\r\nthe die, leaving a 3/32-in. space when the jaws were closed around\r\nthe die. The dies being all ready, the tongs were heated red hot, and\r\nthe dies were picked up and held by the tongs. This tempered them\r\nfrom the outside in, left the teeth the temper required and the\r\noutside slightly softer. The dies held up the work successfully\r\nand were better than when tempered in the same bath.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF TEMPERING ON WATER-QUENCHED GAGES\r\n\r\nThe following information has been supplied by Automatic and Electric\r\nFurnaces, Ltd., 6, Queenstreet, London, S. W.:\r\n\r\nTwo gages of 3/4 in. diameter, 12 threads per inch, were heated\r\nin a Wild-Barfield furnace, using the pyroscopic detector, and\r\nwere quenched in cold water. They were subsequently tempered in a\r\nsalt bath at various increasing temperatures, the effective diameter\r\nof each thread and the scleroscope hardness being measured at each\r\nstage. The figures are in 10,000ths of an inch, and indicate the\r\nchange + or - with reference to the original effective diameter\r\nof the gages. The results for the two gages have been averaged.\r\n\r\nTABLE 24.--CHANGES DUE TO QUENCHING\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n            |  After  |Tempering temperature, degrees Centigrade\r\n   Thread   |quenching|-----------------------------------------\r\n            |         |  220 |  260 |  300 |  340 |  380 |  420\r\n------------|---------|------|------|------|------|------|------\r\n      1     |   +25   |  +19 |  +17 |  +15 |  +13 |  +11 |  +11\r\n      2     |   +18   |  +12 |  +11 |  + 9 |  + 6 |  + 5 |  + 5\r\n      3     |   +12   |  + 6 |  + 5 |  + 3 |    0 |    0 |    0\r\n      4     |   +10   |  + 4 |  + 4 |  + 2 |  ... |    0 |  - 1\r\n      5     |   + 9   |  + 4 |  + 4 |  + 2 |    0 |    0 |    0\r\n      6     |   + 9   |  + 4 |  + 3 |  + 2 |    0 |    0 |    0\r\n      7     |   +10   |  + 5 |  + 5 |  + 3 |  + 2 |  + 1 |  + 2\r\n      8     |   + 8   |  + 4 |  + 3 |  + 2 |    0 |    0 |  + 1\r\n      9     |   + 9   |  + 4 |  + 3 |  + 2 |  + 1 |  + 1 |  + 1\r\n     10     |   + 9   |  + 5 |  + 5 |  + 3 |  + 2 |  + 2 |  + 2\r\n     11     |   + 7   |  + 4 |  + 4 |  + 2 |  + 1 |  + 1 |  + 1\r\n     12     |   + 9   |  + 5 |  + 5 |  + 5 |  + 4 |  + 4 |  + 3\r\n            |         |      |      |      |      |      |\r\nScleroscope |   80    |  70  |  70  |  62  |  56  |  53  |  52\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHad these gages been formed with a plain cylindrical end projecting\r\nin front of the screw, the first two threads would have been prevented\r\nfrom increasing more than the rest. The gages would then have been\r\nfairly easily corrected by lapping after tempering at 220°C. Practically\r\nno lapping would be required if they were tempered at 340°C. There\r\nseems to be no advantage in going to a higher temperature than\r\nthis. The same degree of hardness could have been obtained with\r\nconsiderably less distortion by quenching directly in fused salt. It\r\nis interesting to note that when the swelling after water quenching\r\ndoes not exceed 0.0012 in., practically the whole of it may be\r\nrecovered by tempering at a sufficiently high temperature, but when\r\nthe swelling exceeds this amount the steel assumes a permanently\r\nstrained condition, and at the most only 0.0014 in. can be recovered\r\nby tempering.\r\n\r\nTEMPERING COLORS ON CARBON STEELS\r\n\r\nOpinions differ as to the temperature which is indicated by the\r\nvarious colors, or oxides, which appear on steel in tempering.\r\n\r\nThe figures shown are from five different sources and while the\r\nvariations are not great, it is safer to take the average temperature\r\nshown in the last column.\r\n\r\nTABLE 25.--COLORS, TEMPERATURES, DEGREES FAHRENHEIT\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n                  | _A_ | _B_ | _C_ | _D_ | _E_ | Average\r\n------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------\r\n Faint yellow     | 430 | 430 | 430 | 430 | 430 |   430\r\n Light straw      | 475 | 460 | 450 | ... | 450 |   458\r\n Dark straw       | 500 | 500 | 470 | 450 | 470 |   478\r\n Purple (reddish) | 525 | 530 | 520 | 530 | 510 |   523\r\n Purple (bluish)  | ... | 555 | 550 | 550 | 550 |   551\r\n Blue             | 575 | 585 | 560 | 580 | 560 |   572\r\n Gray blue        | ... | 600 | ... | 600 | 610 |   603\r\n Greenish blue    | ... | 625 | ... | ... | 630 |   627\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTABLE 26.--ANOTHER COLOR TABLE\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Degrees   |\r\n Fahrenheit | High temperatures judged by color\r\n------------|---------------------------------------------\r\n     430    | Very pale yellow \\\r\n     460    | Straw-yellow     |\r\n     480    | Dark yellow      |\r\n     500    | Brown-yellow     > Visible in full daylight\r\n     520    | Brown-purple     |\r\n     540    | Full purple      |\r\n     560    | Full blue        |\r\n     600    | Very dark blue   /\r\n     752    | Red heat, visible in the dark\r\n     885    | Red heat, visible in the twilight\r\n     975    | Red heat, visible in the daylight\r\n   1,292    | Dark red\r\n   1,652    | Cherry-red\r\n   1,832    | Bright cherry-red\r\n   2,012    | Orange-red\r\n   2,192    | Orange-yellow\r\n   2,372    | Yellow-white\r\n   2,552    | White welding heat\r\n   2,732    | Brilliant white\r\n   2,912    | Dazzling white (bluish-white)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese differences might easily be due to the difference in the light\r\nat the time the colors were observed.

The manufacture of tool steel is still an art\r\nwhich, by the aid of science, has lost much of its secrecy; yet\r\ntool steel is today made by practical men skilled as melters,\r\nhammer-men, and rollers, each knowing his art. These practical\r\nmen willingly accept guidance from the chemist and metallurgists.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of conditions existing today in the manufacture of\r\nhigh-speed steel is essential to steel treaters. It is well for\r\nthe manufacturer to have steel treaters understand some of his\r\ntroubles and difficulties, so that they will better comprehend the\r\nnecessity of certain trade customs and practices, and, realizing\r\nthe manufacturer's desire to cooperate with them, will reciprocate.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer of high-speed steel knows and appreciates the\r\ntroubles and difficulties that may sometimes arise in the heat-treating\r\nof his product. His aim is to make a uniform steel that will best\r\nmeet the requirements of the average machine shop on general work,\r\nand at the same time allow the widest variation in heat treatment\r\nto give desired results.\r\n\r\nHigh speed steel is one of the most complex alloys known. A\r\nrepresentative steel contains approximately 24 per cent of alloying\r\nmetals, namely, tungsten, chromium, vanadium, silicon, manganese,\r\nand in addition there is often found cobalt, molybdenum, uranium,\r\nnickel, tin, copper and arsenic.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe selection of a standard analysis by the manufacturer is the\r\nresult of a series of compromises between various properties imparted\r\nto the steel by the addition of different elements and there is a\r\nwide range of chemical analyses of various brands. The steel, to\r\nbe within the range of generally accepted analysis, should contain\r\nover 16 per cent and under 20 per cent tungsten; if of lower tungsten\r\ncontent it should carry proportionately more chromium and vanadium.\r\n\r\nThe combined action of tungsten and chromium in steel gives to it the\r\nremarkable property of maintaining its cutting edge at relatively high\r\ntemperature. This property is commonly spoken of as \"red-hardness.\"\r\nThe percentages of tungsten and chromium present should bear a\r\ndefinite relationship to each other. Chromium imparts to steel\r\na hardening property similar to that given by carbon, although\r\nto a less degree. The hardness imparted to steel by chromium is\r\naccompanied by brittleness. The chromium content should be between\r\n3.5 and 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nVanadium was first introduced in high-speed steel as a \"scavenger,\"\r\nthereby producing a more homogeneous product, of greater density\r\nand physical strength. It soon became evident that vanadium used\r\nin larger quantities than necessary as a scavenger imparted to\r\nthe steel a much greater cutting efficiency. Recently, no less an\r\nauthority than Prof. J. O. Arnold, of the University of Sheffield,\r\nEngland, stated that \"high-speed steels containing vanadium have\r\na mean efficiency of 108.9, as against a mean efficiency of 61.9\r\nobtained from those without vanadium content.\" A wide range of\r\nvanadium content in steel, from 0.5 to 1.5 per cent, is permissible.\r\n\r\nAn ideal analysis for high-speed steel containing 18 per cent tungsten\r\nis a chromium content of approximately 3.85 per cent; vanadium, 0.85\r\nto 1.10 per cent, and carbon, between 0.62 and 0.77 per cent.\r\n\r\nDETRIMENTAL ELEMENTS.--Sulphur and phosphorus are two elements known\r\nto be detrimental to all steels. Sulphur causes \"red-shortness\"\r\nand phosphorus causes \"cold-shortness.\" The detrimental effects\r\nof these two elements counteract each other to some extent but\r\nthe content should be not over 0.02 sulphur and 0.025 phosphorus.\r\nThe serious detrimental effect of small quantities of sulphur and\r\nphosphorus is due to their not being uniformly distributed, owing\r\nto their tendency to segregate.\r\n\r\nThe manganese and silicon contents are relatively unimportant in\r\nthe percentages usually found in high-speed steel.\r\n\r\nThe detrimental effects of tin, copper and arsenic are not generally\r\nrealized by the trade. Small quantities of these impurities are\r\nexceedingly harmful. These elements are very seldom determined\r\nin customers' chemical laboratories and it is somewhat difficult\r\nfor public chemists to analyze for them.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the manufacturer, attention should be called to the\r\nvariations in chemical analyses among the best of laboratories.\r\nGenerally speaking, a steel works' laboratory will obtain results\r\nmore nearly true and accurate than is possible with a customer's\r\nlaboratory, or by a public chemist. This can reasonably be expected,\r\nfor the steel works' chemist is a specialist, analyzing the same\r\nmaterial for the same elements day in and day out.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the chemical laboratory to a tool-steel plant\r\ncannot be over-estimated. Every heat of steel is analyzed for each\r\nelement, and check analyses obtained; also, every substance used\r\nin the mix is analyzed for all impurities. The importance of using\r\npure base materials is known to all manufacturers despite chemical\r\nevidence that certain detrimental elements are removed in the process\r\nof manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of high-speed steel represents the highest art\r\nin the making of steel by tool-steel practice. Some may say, on\r\naccount of our increased knowledge of chemistry and metallurgy,\r\nthat the making of such steel has ceased to be an art, but has\r\nbecome a science. It is, in fact an art; aided by science. The\r\nhuman element in its manufacture is a decided factor, as will be\r\nbrought in the following remarks:\r\n\r\nThe heat treatment of steel in its broad aspect may be said to\r\ncommence with the melting furnace and end with the hardening and\r\ntempering of the finished product. High-speed steel is melted by\r\ntwo general types of furnace, known as crucible and electric. Steel\r\ntreaters, however, are more vitally interested in the changes that\r\ntake place in the steel during the various processes of manufacture\r\nrather than a detailed description of those processes, which are\r\nmore or less familiar to all.\r\n\r\nIn order that good high-speed steel may be furnished in finished\r\nbars, it must be of correct chemical analysis, properly melted and\r\ncast into solid ingots, free from blow-holes and surface defects.\r\nSudden changes of temperature are to be guarded against at every\r\nstage of its manufacture and subsequent treatment. The ingots are\r\nrelatively weak, and the tendency to crack due to cooling strains\r\nis great. For this reason the hot ingots are not allowed to cool\r\nquickly, but are placed in furnaces which are of about the same\r\ntemperature and are allowed to cool gradually before being placed\r\nin stock. Good steel can be made only from good ingots.\r\n\r\nSteel treaters should be more vitally interested in the important\r\nchanges which take place in high-speed steel during the hammering\r\noperations than that of any other working the steel receives in\r\nthe course of its manufacture.\r\n\r\nQUALITY AND STRUCTURE\r\n\r\nThe quality of high-speed steel is dependent to a very great extent\r\nupon its structure. The making of the structure begins under the\r\nhammer, and the beneficial effects produced in this stage persist\r\nthrough the subsequent operations, provided they are properly carried\r\nout. The massive carbides and tungstides present in the ingot are\r\nbroken down and uniformly distributed throughout the billet.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this the reduction in area must be sufficient and the\r\nhammer blows should be heavy, so as to carry the compression into\r\nthe center of the billet; otherwise, undesirable characteristics\r\nsuch as coarse structure and carbide envelopes will exist and cause\r\nthe steel treater much trouble. Surface defects invisible in the\r\ningot may be opened up under the hammering operation, in which\r\nevent they are chipped from the hot billet.\r\n\r\nIngots are first hammered into billets. These billets are carefully\r\ninspected and all surface defects ground or chipped. The hammered\r\nbillets are again slowly heated and receive a second hammering,\r\nknown as \"cogging.\" The billet resulting therefrom is known as\r\na \"cogged\" billet and is of the proper size for the rolling mill\r\nor for the finishing hammer.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not considered good mill practice, some manufacturers\r\nwho have a large rolling mill perform the very important cogging\r\noperation in the rolling mill instead of under the hammer. Cogging\r\nin a rolling mill does not break up and distribute the carbides and\r\ntungstides as efficiently as cogging under the hammer; another objection\r\nto cogging in the rolling mill is that there is no opportunity to\r\nchip surface defects developed as they can be under the trained eye\r\nof a hammer-man, thereby eliminating such defects in the finished\r\nbillet.\r\n\r\nThe rolling of high-speed steel is an art known to very few. The\r\nvarious factors governing the proper rolling are so numerous that\r\nit is necessary for each individual rolling mill to work out a\r\npractice that gives the best results upon the particular analysis\r\nof steel it makes. Important elements entering into the rolling\r\nare the heating and finishing temperatures, draft, and speed of\r\nthe mill. In all of these the element of time must be considered.\r\n\r\nHigh-speed steel should be delivered from the rolling mill to the\r\nannealing department free from scale, for scale promotes the formation\r\nof a decarbonized surface. In preparation of bars for annealing,\r\nthey are packed in tubes with a mixture of charcoal, lime, and\r\nother material. The tubes are sealed and placed in the annealing\r\nfurnace and the temperature is gradually raised to about 1,650°F.,\r\nand held there for a sufficient length of time, depending upon the\r\nsize of the bars. After very slow cooling the bars are removed\r\nfrom the tubes. They should then show a Brinnell number of between\r\n235 and 275.\r\n\r\nThe inspection department ranks with the chemical and metallurgical\r\ndepartments in safeguarding the quality of the product. It inspects\r\nall finished material from the standpoint of surface defects, hardness,\r\nsize and fracture. It rejects such steel as is judged not to meet\r\nthe manufacturer's standard. The inspection and metallurgical\r\ndepartments work hand in hand, and if any department is not functioning\r\nproperly it will soon become evident to the inspectors, enabling\r\nthe management to remedy the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe successful manufacture of high-speed steel can only be obtained\r\nby those companies who have become specialists. The art and skill\r\nnecessary in the successful working of such steel can be attained\r\nonly by a man of natural ability in his chosen trade, and trained\r\nunder the supervision of experts. To become an expert operator\r\nin any department of its manufacture, it is necessary that the\r\noperator work almost exclusively in the production of such steel.\r\n\r\nAs to the heat treatment, it is customary for the manufacturer\r\nto recommend to the user a procedure that will give to his steel\r\na high degree of cutting efficiency. The recommendations of the\r\nmanufacturer should be conservative, embracing fairly wide limits,\r\nas the tendency of the user is to adhere very closely to the\r\nmanufacturer's recommendations. Unless one of the manufacturer's\r\nexpert service men has made a detailed study of the customer's\r\nproblem, the manufacturer is not justified in laying down set rules,\r\nfor if the customer does a little experimenting he can probably\r\nmodify the practice so as to produce results that are particularly\r\nwell adapted to his line of work.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of heat-treating is to produce a tool that will cut so\r\nas to give maximum productive efficiency. This cutting efficiency\r\ndepends upon the thermal stability of the complex hardenites existing\r\nin the hardened and tempered steel. The writer finds it extremely\r\ndifficult to convey the meaning of the word \"hardenite\" to those that\r\ndo not have a clear conception of the term. The complex hardenites\r\nin high-speed steel may be described as that form of solid solution\r\nwhich gives to it its cutting efficiency. The complex hardenites are\r\nproduced by heating the steel to a very high temperature, near the\r\nmelting point, which throws into solution carbides and tungstides,\r\nprovided they have been properly broken up in the hammering process\r\nand uniformly distributed throughout the steel. By quenching the\r\nsteel at correct temperature this solid solution is retained at\r\natmospheric temperature.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention to make any definite recommendations as to\r\nheat-treating of high-speed steel by the users. It is recognized\r\nthat such steel can be heat-treated to give satisfactory results\r\nby different methods. It is, however, believed that the American\r\npractice of hardening and tempering is becoming more uniform. This\r\nis due largely to the exchange of opinions in meetings and elsewhere.\r\nThe trend of American practice for hardening is toward the following:\r\n\r\n_First_, slowly and carefully preheat the tool to a temperature\r\nof approximately 1,500°F., taking care to prevent the formation\r\nof excessive scale.\r\n\r\n_Second_, transfer to a furnace, the temperature of which is\r\napproximately 2,250 to 2,400°F., and allow to remain in the furnace\r\nuntil the tool is heated uniformly to the above temperature.\r\n\r\n_Third_, cool rapidly _in oil_, dry air blast, or lead bath.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, draw back to a temperature to meet the physical requirements\r\nof the tool, and allow to cool in air.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long ago that the desirability of drawing hardened\r\nhigh-speed steel to a temperature of 1,100° was pointed out, and it\r\nis indeed encouraging to learn that comparatively few treaters have\r\nfailed to make use of this fact. Many treaters at first contended\r\nthat the steel would be soft after drawing to this temperature and\r\nit is only recently, since numerous actual tests have demonstrated\r\nits value, that the old prejudice has been eliminated.\r\n\r\nHigh-speed steel should be delivered only in the annealed condition\r\nbecause annealing relieves the internal strains inevitable in the\r\nmanufacture and puts it in vastly improved physical condition. The\r\nmanufacturer's inspection after annealing also discloses defects\r\nnot visible in the unannealed state.\r\n\r\nThe only true test for a brand of high-speed steel is the service that\r\nit gives by continued performance month in and month out under actual\r\nshop conditions. The average buyer is not justified in conducting a\r\ntest, but can well continue to purchase his requirements from a\r\nreputable manufacturer of a brand that is nationally known. The\r\nmanufacturer is always willing to cooperate with the trade in the\r\nconducting of a test and is much interested in the information\r\nreceived from a well conducted test. A test, to be valuable, should be\r\nconducted in a manner as nearly approaching actual working conditions\r\nin the plant in which the test is made as is practical. In conducting\r\na test a few reputable brands should be allowed to enter. All tools\r\nentered should be of exactly the same size and shape. There is much\r\ndifference of opinion as to the best practical method of conducting\r\na test, and the decision as to how the test should be conducted\r\nshould be left to the customer, who should cooperate with the\r\nmanufacturers in devising a test which would give the best basis\r\nfor conclusions as to how the particular brands would perform under\r\nactual shop conditions.\r\n\r\nThe value of the file test depends upon the quality of the file and\r\nthe intelligence and experience of the person using it. The file\r\ntest is not reliable, but in the hands of an experienced operator,\r\ngives some valuable information. Almost every steel treater knows\r\nof numerous instances where a lathe tool which could be touched\r\nwith a file has shown wonderful results as to cutting efficiency.\r\n\r\nModern tool-steel practice has changed from that of the past, not\r\nby the use of labor-saving machinery, but by the use of scientific\r\ndevices which aid and guide the skilled craftsman in producing a\r\nsteel of higher quality and greater uniformity. It is upon the\r\nintelligence, experience, and skill of the individual that quality\r\nof tool steel depends.\r\n\r\nHARDENING HIGH-SPEED STEELS\r\n\r\nWe will now take up the matter of hardening high-speed steels. The\r\nmost ordinary tools used are for lathes and planers. The forging\r\nshould be done at carbon-steel heat. Rough-grind while still hot\r\nand preheat to about carbon-steel hardening heat, then heat quickly\r\nin high-speed furnace to white heat, and quench in oil. If a very\r\nhard substance is to be cut, the point of tool may be quenched in\r\nkerosene or water and when nearly black, finish cooling in oil.\r\nTempering must be done to suit the material to be cut. For cutting\r\ncast iron, brass castings, or hard steel, tempering should be done\r\nmerely to take strains out of steel.\r\n\r\nOn ordinary machinery steel or nickel steel the temper can be drawn\r\nto a dark blue or up to 900°F. If the tool is of a special form\r\nor character, the risk of melting or scaling the point cannot be\r\ntaken. In these cases the tool should be packed, but if there is\r\nno packing equipment, a tool can be heated to as high heat as is\r\nsafe without risk to cutting edges, and cyanide or prussiate of\r\npotash can be sprinkled over the face and then quenched in oil.\r\n\r\nSome very adverse criticism may be heard on this point, but experience\r\nhas proved that such tools will stand up very nicely and be perfectly\r\nfree from scales or pipes. Where packing cannot be done, milling\r\ncutters, and tools to be hardened all over, can be placed in muffled\r\nfurnace, brought to 2,220° and quenched in oil. All such tools,\r\nhowever, must be preheated slowly to 1,400 to 1,500° then placed in\r\na high-speed furnace and brought up quickly. Do not soak high-speed\r\nsteel at high heats. Quench in oil.\r\n\r\nWe must bear in mind that the heating furnace is likely to expand\r\ntools, therefore provision must be made to leave extra stock to\r\ntake care of such expansion. Tools with shanks such as counter\r\nbores, taps, reamers, drills, etc., should be heated no further\r\nthan they are wanted hard, and quench in oil. If a forge is not\r\nat hand and heating must be done, use a muffle furnace and cover\r\nsmall shanks with a paste from fire clay or ground asbestos. Hollow\r\nmills, spring threading dies, and large cutting tools with small\r\nshanks should have the holes thoroughly packed or covered with\r\nasbestos cement as far as they are wanted soft.\r\n\r\nCUTTING-OFF STEEL FROM BAR\r\n\r\nTo cut a piece from an annealed bar, cut off with a hack saw, milling\r\ncutter or circular saw. Cut clear through the bar; do not nick or\r\nbreak. To cut a piece from an unannealed bar, cut right off with\r\nan abrasive saw; do not nick or break. If of large cross-section,\r\ncut off hot with a chisel by first slowly and uniformly heating\r\nthe bar, at the point to be cut, to a good lemon heat, 1,800 to\r\n1,850°F. and cut right off while hot; do not nick or break. Allow\r\nthe tool length and bar to cool before reheating for forging.\r\n\r\nLATHE AND PLANER TOOLS\r\n\r\nFORGING.--Gently warm the steel to remove any chill, is particularly\r\ndesirable in the winter, then heat slowly and carefully to a scaling\r\nheat, that is a lemon heat (1,800 to 2,000°F.), and forge uniformly.\r\nReheat the tool for further forging directly the steel begins to\r\nstiffen under the hammer. Under no circumstances forge the steel\r\nwhen the temperature falls below a dark lemon to an orange color\r\nabout 1,700°F. Reheat as often as is necessary to finish forging\r\nthe tool to shape. Allow the tool to cool after forging by burying\r\nthe tool in dry ashes or lime. Do not place on the damp ground\r\nor in a draught of air.\r\n\r\nThe heating for forging should be done preferably in a pipe or\r\nmuffle furnace but if this is not convenient use a good clean fire\r\nwith plenty of fuel between the blast pipe and the tool. Never\r\nallow the tool to soak after the desired forging heat has been\r\nreached. Do not heat the tool further back than is necessary to\r\nshape the tool, but give the tool sufficient heat. See that the\r\nback of the tool is flatly dressed to provide proper support under\r\nthe nose of the tool.\r\n\r\nHARDENING HIGH-SPEED STEEL.--Slowly reheat the cutting edge of\r\nthe tool to a cherry red, 1,400°F., then force the blast so as\r\nto raise the temperature quickly to a full white heat, 2,200 to\r\n2,250°F., that is, until the tool starts to sweat at the cutting\r\nface. Cool the point of the tool in a dry air blast or preferably\r\nin oil, further cool in oil keeping the tool moving until the tool\r\nhas become black hot.\r\n\r\nTo remove hardening strains reheat the tool to from 500 to 1,100°F.\r\nCool in oil or atmosphere. This second heat treatment adds to the\r\ntoughness of the tool and therefore to its life.\r\n\r\nGRINDING TOOLS.--Grind tools to remove all scale. Use a quick-cutting,\r\ndry, abrasive wheel. If using a wet wheel, be sure to use plenty\r\nof water. Do not under any circumstances force the tool against\r\nthe wheel so as to draw the color, as this is likely to set up\r\nchecks on the surface of the tool to its detriment.\r\n\r\nFOR MILLING CUTTERS AND FORMED TOOLS\r\n\r\nFORGING.--Forge as before.--ANNEALING.--Place the steel in a pipe,\r\nbox or muffle. Arrange the steel so as to allow at least 1 in.\r\nof packing, consisting of dry powder ashes, powdered charcoal,\r\nmica, etc., between the pieces and the walls of the box or pipe.\r\nIf using a pipe close the ends. Heat slowly and uniformly to a\r\ncherry red, 1,375 to 1,450°F. according to size. Hold the steel at\r\nthis temperature until the heat has thoroughly saturated through\r\nthe metal, then allow the muffle box and tools to cool very slowly\r\nin a dying furnace or remove the muffle with its charge and bury\r\nin hot ashes or lime. The slower the cooling the softer the steel.\r\n\r\nThe heating requires from 2 to 10 hr. depending upon the size of\r\nthe piece.\r\n\r\nHARDENING AND TEMPERING.--It is preferable to use two furnaces\r\nwhen hardening milling cutters and special shape tools. One furnace\r\nshould be maintained at a uniform temperature from 1,375 to 1,450°F.\r\nwhile the other should be maintained at about 2,250°F. Keep the\r\ntool to be hardened in the low temperature furnace until the tool\r\nhas attained the full heat of this furnace. A short time should be\r\nallowed so as to be assured that the center of the tool is as hot\r\nas the outside. Then quickly remove the tool from this preheating\r\nfurnace to the full heat furnace. Keep the tool in this furnace only\r\nas long as is necessary for the tool to attain the full temperature\r\nof this furnace. Then quickly remove and quench in oil or in a\r\ndry air blast. Remove before the tool is entirely cold and draw\r\nthe temper in an oil bath by raising the temperature of the oil\r\nto from 500 to 750°F. and allow this tool to remain, at this\r\ntemperature, in the bath for at least 30 min., insuring uniformity\r\nof temper; then cool in the bath, atmosphere or oil.\r\n\r\nIf higher drawing temperatures are desired than those possible\r\nwith oil, a salt bath can be used. A very excellent bath is made\r\nby mixing two parts by weight of crude potassium nitrate and three\r\nparts crude sodium nitrate. These will melt at about 450°F. and\r\ncan be used up to 1,000°F. Before heating the steel in the salt\r\nbath, slowly preheat, preferably in oil. Reheating the hardened\r\nhigh-speed steel to 1,000°F. will materially increase the life\r\nof lathe tools, but milling and form cutters, taps, dies, etc.,\r\nshould not be reheated higher than 500 to 650°F., unless extreme\r\nhardness is required, when 1,100 to 1,000°F., will give the hardest\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKING HIGH-SPEED STEEL\r\n\r\nOwing to the wide variations in the composition of high-speed steels\r\nby various makers, it is always advisable to follow the directions\r\nof each when using his brand of steel. In the absence of specific\r\ndirections the following general suggestions from several makers\r\nwill be found helpful.\r\n\r\nThe Ludlum Steel Company recommend the following:\r\n\r\nCUTTING-OFF.--To cut a piece from an annealed bar, cut off with\r\na hack saw, milling cutter or circular saw. Cut clear through the\r\nbar; do not nick or break. To cut a piece from an unannealed bar,\r\ncut right off with an abrasive saw; do not nick or break. If of\r\nlarge cross-section, cut off hot with a chisel by first slowly\r\nand uniformly heating the bar, at the point to be cut, to a good\r\nlemon heat, 1,800°-1,850°F. and cut right off while hot; do not nick\r\nor break. Allow the tool length and bar to cool before reheating\r\nfor forging.\r\n\r\nLATHE AND PLANER TOOLS\r\n\r\nTO FORGE.--Gently warm the steel to remove any chill is particularly\r\ndesirable in the winter. Then heat slowly and carefully to a scaling\r\nheat, that is a lemon heat (1,800°-2,000°F.), and forge uniformly.\r\nReheat the tool for further forging directly the steel begins to\r\nstiffen under the hammer. Under no circumstances forge the steel\r\nwhen the temperature falls below a dark lemon to an orange color:\r\nabout 1,700°F. Reheat as often as is necessary to finish forging\r\nthe tool to shape. Allow the tool to cool after forging by burying\r\nthe tool in dry ashes or lime. Do not place on the damp ground\r\nor in a draught of air.\r\n\r\nThe heating for forging should be done preferably in a pipe or\r\nmuffle furnace, but if this is not convenient use a good clean\r\nfire with plenty of fuel between the blast pipe and the tool. Never\r\nallow the tool to soak after the desired forging heat has been\r\nreached. Do not heat the tool further back than is necessary to\r\nshape the tool, but give the tool sufficient heat. See that the\r\nback of the tool is flatly dressed to provide proper support under\r\nthe nose of the tool.\r\n\r\nHARDENING.--Slowly reheat the cutting edge of the tool to a cherry\r\nred, 1,400°F., then force the blast so as to raise the temperature\r\nquickly to a full white heat, 2,200°-2,250°F., that is, until the\r\ntool starts to sweat at the cutting face. Cool the point of the\r\ntool in a dry air blast or preferably in oil; further cool in oil,\r\nkeeping the tool moving until the tool has become black hot.\r\n\r\nTo remove hardening strains reheat the tool to from 500° to 1,100°F.\r\nCool in oil or atmosphere. This second heat treatment adds to the\r\ntoughness of the tool and therefore to its life.\r\n\r\nGRINDING.--Grind tools to remove all scale. Use a quick cutting,\r\ndry, abrasive wheel. If using a wet wheel, be sure to use plenty\r\nof water. Do not under any circumstances force the tool against\r\nthe wheel so as to draw the color, as this is likely to set up\r\nchecks on the surface of the tool to its detriment.\r\n\r\nThe Firth-Sterling Steel Company say:\r\n\r\nINSTEAD OF PRINTING ANY RULES ON THE HARDENING AND TEMPERING OF\r\nFIRTH-STERLING STEELS WE WISH TO SAY TO OUR CUSTOMERS: TRUST THE\r\nSTEEL TO THE SKILL AND THE JUDGEMENT OF YOUR TOOLSMITH AND TOOL\r\nTEMPERER.\r\n\r\nThe steel workers of today know by personal experience and by\r\ninheritance all the standard rules and theories on forging, hardening\r\nand tempering of all fine tool steels. They know the importance of\r\nslow, uniform heating, and the danger of overheating some steels,\r\nand underheating others.\r\n\r\nThe tempering of tools and dies is a science taught by heat, muscle\r\nand brains.\r\n\r\nThe tool temperer is the man to hold responsible for results. The\r\ntempering of tools has been his life work. He may find suggestions\r\non the following pages interesting, but we are always ready to\r\ntrust the treatment of our steels to the experienced man at the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nHEAT TREATMENT OF LATHE, PLANER AND SIMILAR TOOLS\r\n\r\nFIRE.--For these tools a good fire is one made of hard foundry\r\ncoke, broken in small pieces, in an ordinary blacksmith forge with\r\na few bricks laid over the top to form a hollow fire. The bricks\r\nshould be thoroughly heated before tools are heated. Hard coal\r\nmay be used very successfully in place of hard coke and will give\r\na higher heat. It is very easy to give Blue Chip the proper heat\r\nif care is used in making up the fire.\r\n\r\nFORGING.--Heat slowly and uniformly to a good forging heat. Do\r\nnot hammer the steel after it cools below a bright red. Avoid as\r\nmuch as possible heating the body of the tool, so as to retain\r\nthe natural toughness in the neck of the tool.\r\n\r\nHARDENING.--Heat the point of the tool to an extreme white heat\r\n(about 2,200°F.) until the flux runs. This heat should be the highest\r\npossible short of melting the point. Care should be taken to confine\r\nthe heat as near to the point as possible so as to leave the annealing\r\nand consequent toughness in the neck of the tool and where the tool\r\nis held in the tool post.\r\n\r\nCOOL in an air blast, the open air or in oil, depending upon the\r\ntools or the work they are to do.\r\n\r\nFor roughing tools temper need not be drawn except for work where\r\nthe edge tends to crumble on account of being too hard.\r\n\r\nFor finishing tools draw the temper to suit the purpose for which\r\nthey are to be used.\r\n\r\nGRIND thoroughly on dry wheel (or wet wheel if care is used to prevent\r\nchecking).\r\n\r\nHEAT TREATMENT OF MILLING CUTTERS, DRILLS, REAMERS, ETC.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE.--Gas and electric furnaces designed for high heats are\r\nnow made for treating high-speed steels. We recommend them for\r\ntreating all kinds of Blue Chip tools and particularly the above\r\nclass. After tools reach a yellow heat in the forge fire they must\r\nnot be allowed to touch the fuel or come in contact with the blast\r\nor surrounding air.\r\n\r\nHEATING.--Tools of this kind should be heated to a mellow white\r\nheat, or as hot as possible without injuring the cutting edges\r\n(2,000 to 2,200°F.). For most work the higher the heat the better\r\nthe tool. Where furnaces are used, we recommend preheating the\r\ntools to a red heat in one furnace before putting them in a white\r\nhot furnace.\r\n\r\nCOOLING.--We recommend quenching all of the above tools in oil\r\nwhen taken from the fire. We have found fish oil, cottonseed oil,\r\nHoughton's No. 2 soluble oil and linseed oil satisfactory. The\r\nhigh heat is the important thing in hardening Blue Chip tools.\r\nIf a white hot tool is allowed to cool in the open air it will be\r\nhard, but the air scales the tool.\r\n\r\nDRAWING THE TEMPER.--Tools of this class should be drawn considerably\r\nmore than water-hardening steel for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHEAT TREATMENT OF PUNCHES AND DIES, SHEARS, TAPS, ETC.\r\n\r\nHEATING.--The degree to which tools of the above classes should\r\nbe heated depends upon the shape, size and use for which they are\r\nintended. Generally, they should not be heated to quite as high a\r\nheat as lathe tools or milling cutters. They should have a high\r\nheat, but not enough to make the flux run on the steel (by pyrometer\r\n1,900 to 2,100°F.).\r\n\r\nCOOLING.--Depending on the tools, some should be dipped in oil\r\nall over, some only part way, and others allowed to cool down in\r\nthe air naturally, or under air blast. In cooling, the toughness\r\nis retained by allowing some parts to cool slowly and quenching\r\nparts that should be hard.\r\n\r\nDRAWING THE TEMPER.--As in cooling, some parts of these tools will\r\nrequire more drawing than others, but, on the whole, they must\r\nbe drawn more than water hardening tools for the same purpose or\r\nto about 500°F. all over, so that a good file will just \"touch\"\r\nthe cutting or working parts.\r\n\r\nBARIUM CHLORIDE PROCESS.--This is a process developed for treating\r\ncertain classes of tools, such as taps, forming tools, etc. It is\r\nbeing successfully used in many large plants. Briefly the treatment\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\nIn this treatment the tools are first preheated to a red heat,\r\nbut small tools may be immersed without preheating. The barium\r\nchloride bath is kept at a temperature of from 2,000 to 2,100°F.,\r\nand tools are held in it long enough to reach the same temperature.\r\nThey are then dipped in oil. The barium chloride which adheres\r\nto the tools is brushed off, leaving the tools as dean as before\r\nheating.\r\n\r\nA CHROMIUM-COBALT STEEL\r\n\r\nThe Latrobe Steel Company make a high-speed steel without tungsten,\r\nits red-hardness properties depending on chromium and cobalt instead\r\nof tungsten. It is known as P. R. K-33 steel. It does not require\r\nthe high temperature of the tungsten steels, hardening at 1,830 to\r\n1,850°F. instead of 2,200° or even higher, as with the tungsten.\r\n\r\nThis steel is forged at 1,900 to 2,000°F. and must not be worked\r\nat a lower temperature than 1,600°F. It requires soaking in the\r\nfire more than the tungsten steels. It can be normalized by heating\r\nslowly and thoroughly to 1,475°F., holding this for from 10 to 20\r\nmin. according to the size of the piece and cooling in the open\r\nair, protected from drafts.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of this steel is that it becomes non-magnetic at or\r\nabove 1,960°F. and the magnetic quality is not restored by cooling.\r\nNormalizing as above, however, restores the magnetic qualities. This\r\nenables the user to detect any tools which have been overheated,\r\nwith a horseshoe magnet.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes advantageous to dip tools, before heating for hardening,\r\nin ordinary fuel or quenching oil. The oil leaves a thin film of\r\ncarbon which tends to prevent decarbonization, giving a very hard\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nFor other makes of high-speed steel used in lathe and planer tools\r\nthe makers recommend that the tools be cut from the bar with a\r\nhack saw or else heated and cut with a chisel. The heating should\r\nbe very slow until the steel reaches a red after which it can be\r\nheated more rapidly and should only be forged at a high heat. It\r\ncan be forged at very high heats but care should be taken not to\r\nforge at a low heat. The heating should be uniform and penetrate\r\nclear to the center of the bar before forging is begun. Reheat\r\nas often as necessary to forge at the proper heat.\r\n\r\nAfter forging cool in lime before attempting to harden. Do not\r\nattempt to harden with the forging heat as was sometimes done with\r\nthe carbon tools.\r\n\r\nFor hardening forged tools, heat slowly up to a bright red and\r\nthen rapidly until the point of the tool is almost at a melting\r\nheat. Cool in a blast of cold, dry air. For large sizes of steel,\r\ncool in linseed oil or in fish oil as is most convenient. If the\r\ntools are to be used for finishing cuts heat to a bright yellow\r\nand quench in oil. Grind for use on a sand wheel or grindstone\r\nin preference to an emery or an artificial abrasive wheel.\r\n\r\nFor hardening milling and similar cutters, preheat to a bright\r\nred, place the cutter on a round bar of suitable size, and revolve\r\nit quickly over a very hot fire. Heat as high as possible without\r\nmelting the points of the teeth and cool in a cold blast of dry\r\nair or in fish oil.\r\n\r\nLight fragile cutters, twist drills, taps and formed cutters may\r\nbe heated almost white and then dipped in fish oil for hardening.\r\nWhere possible it is better to give an even higher heat and cool\r\nin the blast of cold, dry air as previously recommended.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR HANDLING HIGH-SPEED STEELS\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions for handling high-speed steels are given\r\nby a maker whose steel is probably typical of a number of different\r\nmakes, so that they will be found useful in other cases as well.\r\nThese include hints as to forging as well as hardening, together\r\nwith a list of \"dont's\" which are often very useful. This applies\r\nto forging, hardening of lathe, slotting, planing and all similar\r\ntools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--All-steel, 5/8 in. square, 1/2 X 1 in.,\r\nand larger is usually mild finished, and can be cut in a hack saw.\r\nIf cut off hot, be sure to heat the butt end slowly and thoroughly\r\nin a clean fire. Rapid and insufficient heating invariably cracks\r\nthe steel. If you want to stamp the end with the name of the steel,\r\nit is necessary that this is done at a good high orange color heat,\r\nas it is otherwise apt to split the steel. (Take your time, do\r\nnot hurry.)]\r\n\r\nHARDENING HIGH-SPEED STEEL\r\n\r\nIn forging use coke for fuel in the forge. Heat steel slowly and\r\nthoroughly to a lemon heat. Do not forge at a lower heat. Do not\r\nlet the steel cool below a bright cherry red while forging. After\r\nthe tool is dressed, reheat to forging heat to remove the forging\r\nstrain, and lay on the floor until cold. Then have the tool rough\r\nground on a dry emery wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Be sure to have a full yellow heat at the\r\ndotted line. Remember this is a boring mill tool and will stand\r\nout in the tool-post, and if you do not have a high thorough lemon\r\nheat, your tool will snap off at the dotted line. (Ninety-five\r\nper cent of all tools which break, have been forged at too low a\r\nheat or at a heat not thorough to the center.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Keep your high lemon forging heat up.\r\nIf you forge under a steam hammer, take light blows. Do not jam\r\nyour tool into shape. Put frequently back into the fire. Never\r\nlet the high lemon color go down and beyond the dotted line.]\r\n\r\nFor built-up and bent tools special care should be taken that the\r\nforging heat does not go below a bright cherry. For tools 3/4 by\r\n1-1/2 or larger where there is a big strain in forging, such as\r\nbending at angles of about 45 deg. and building the tools up, they\r\nshould be heated to at least 1,700°F. Slowly and without much blast.\r\nFor a 3/4 by 1-1/2 tool it should take about 10 min. with the correct\r\nblast in a coke fire. Larger tools in proportion. They can then be\r\nbent readily, but no attempt should be made to forge the steel\r\nfurther without reheating to maintain the bright cherry red. This\r\nis essential, as otherwise the tools crack in hardening or while\r\nin use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Be sure that the tool is absolutely straight\r\nat the bottom, so as to lie flat in the tool-post.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--This is the finished forged tool, and\r\nlet this grow cold by itself, the slower the better. It is well to\r\ncool the tool slowly in hot ashes, to remove all forging strain.\r\nYou can now grind the tool dry on a sharp emery wheel. The more\r\nyou now finish the tool in grinding, the less there is to come\r\noff after hardening.]\r\n\r\nIn hardening place the tool in a coke fire (hollow fire if possible)\r\nwith a slow blast and heat gradually up to a white welding heat\r\non the nose of the tool. Then dip the white hot part only into\r\nthin oil or hold in a strong cold air blast. When hardening in\r\noil do not hold the tool in one place but keep it moving so that\r\nit cools as quickly as possible. It is not necessary to draw the\r\ntemper after hardening these tools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--This tool is ground, ready for hardening.\r\nNever harden from the forging heat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Heat the nose of the tool only up to dotted\r\nline, very slowly and thoroughly to an absolutely white welding\r\nheat, so that it shows a trifle fused around the edges, and be\r\nvery sure that this fusing has gone thoroughly through the nose,\r\notherwise the fusing effect will be taken off after the second\r\ngrinding. Note the difference of the nose between this and Fig. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Shows unnecessary roasting and drossing.\r\nSuch hardening requires a great amount of grinding and is not good.\r\nAfter hardening grind carefully on a wet emery wheel, and be sure\r\nthat the wheel is sharp with a plentiful supply of water. Do not\r\nforce the grinding, otherwise the cold water striking the steel\r\nheated up by friction, will crack the nose. Be sure that the grinding\r\nwheel is sharp.]\r\n\r\nIn grinding all tools should be ground as lightly as possible on\r\na soft wet sandstone or on a wet emery wheel, and care should be\r\ntaken not to create any surface cracks, which are invariably the\r\nresult of grinding too forcibly. The foregoing illustrations, Figs.\r\n84 to 91, with their captions, will be found helpful.\r\n\r\nSpecial points of caution to be observed when hardening high-speed\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nDON'T use a green coal fire; use coke, or build a hollow fire.\r\n\r\nDON'T have the bed of the fire free from coal.\r\n\r\nDON'T hurry the heating for forging. The heating has to be done\r\nvery slowly and the forging heat has to be kept very high (a full\r\nlemon color) heat and the tool has to be continually brought back\r\ninto the fire to keep the high heat up. When customers complain\r\nabout seams and cracks, in 9 cases out of 10, this has been caused\r\nby too low a forging heat, and when the blacksmith complains about\r\ntools cracking, it is necessary to read this paragraph to him.\r\n\r\nDON'T try to jam the tool into shape under a steam hammer with one\r\nor two blows; take easy blows and keep the heat high.\r\n\r\nDON'T have the tool curved at the bottom; it must lie perfectly\r\nflat in the tool post.\r\n\r\nDON'T harden from your forging heat; let the tool grow cold or\r\nfairly cold. After forging you can rough grind the tool dry, but\r\nnot too forcibly.\r\n\r\nDON'T, for hardening, get more than the nose white hot.\r\n\r\nDON'T get the white heat on the surface only.\r\n\r\nDON'T hurry your heating for hardening; let the heat soak thoroughly\r\nthrough the nose of the tool.\r\n\r\nDON'T melt the nose of the tool.\r\n\r\nDON'T, as a rule, dip the nose into water; this should be done\r\nonly for extremely hard material. It is dangerous to put the nose\r\ninto water for fear of cracking and when you do put the nose into\r\nwater put just 1/2 in. only of the extreme white hot part into the\r\nwater and don't keep it too long in the water; just a few seconds,\r\nand then harden in oil. We do not recommend water hardening.\r\n\r\nDON'T grind too forcibly.\r\n\r\nDON'T grind dry after hardening.\r\n\r\nDON'T discolor the steel in grinding.\r\n\r\nDON'T give too much clearance on tools for cutting cast iron.\r\n\r\nDON'T start on cast iron with a razor edge on the tool. Take an\r\noil stone and wipe three or four times over the razor edge.\r\n\r\nDON'T use tool holder steel from bars without hardening the nose\r\nof each individual tool bit.\r\n\r\nAIR-HARDENING STEELS.--These steels are recommended for boring,\r\nturning and planing where the cost of high-speed seems excessive.\r\nThey are also recommended for hard wood knives, for roughing and\r\nfinishing bronze and brass, and for hot bolt forging dies. This\r\nsteel cannot be cut or punched cold but can be shaped and ground\r\non abrasive wheels of various kinds.\r\n\r\nIt should be heated slowly and evenly for forging and kept as evenly\r\nheated at a bright red as possible. It should not be forged after\r\nit cools to a dark red.\r\n\r\nAfter the tool is made, heat it again to a bright red and lay it\r\ndown to cool in a dry place or it can be cooled in a cold, dry\r\nair blast. Water must be kept away from it while it is hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFURNACES\r\n\r\nThere are so many standard furnaces now on the market that it is\r\nnot necessary to go into details of their design and construction\r\nand only a few will be illustrated. Oil, gas and coal or coke are\r\nmost common but there is a steady growth of the use of electric\r\nfurnaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Standard lead pot furnace.]\r\n\r\nTYPICAL OIL-FIRED FURNACES.--Several types of standard oil-fired\r\nfurnaces are shown herewith. Figure 92 is a lead pot furnace, Fig.\r\n93 is a vertical furnace with a center column. This column reduces\r\nthe cubical contents to be heated and also supports the cover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Furnace with center column.]\r\n\r\nA small tool furnace is shown in Fig. 94, which gives the construction\r\nand heat circulation. A larger furnace for high-speed steel is\r\ngiven in Fig. 95. The steel is supported above the heat, the lower\r\nflame passing beneath the support.\r\n\r\nFor hardening broaches and long reamers and taps, the furnace shown\r\nin Fig. 96 is used. Twelve jets are used, these coming in radially\r\nto produce a whirling motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Furnace for cutting tools.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--High-speed steel furnace.]\r\n\r\nOil and gas furnaces may be divided into three types: the open\r\nheating chamber in which combustion takes place in the chamber\r\nand directly over the stock; the semimuffle heating chamber in\r\nwhich combustion takes place beneath the floor of the chamber from\r\nwhich the hot gases pass into the chamber through suitable openings;\r\nand the muffle heating chamber in which the heat entirely surrounds\r\nthe chamber but does not enter it. The open furnace is used for\r\nforging, tool dressing and welding. The muffle furnace is used for\r\nhardening dies, taps, cutters and similar tools of either carbon\r\nor high-speed steel. The muffle furnace is for spring hardening,\r\nenameling, assaying and work where the gases of combustion may\r\nhave an injurious effect on the material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Furnace for hardening broaches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Forging and welding furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--Semi-muffle furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Muffle furnace.]\r\n\r\nFurnaces of these types of oil-burning furnaces are shown in Figs.\r\n97, 98, and 99; these being made by the Gilbert & Barker Manufacturing\r\nCompany. The first has an air curtain formed by jets from the large\r\npipe just below the opening, to protect the operator from heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Gas fired furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Car door type of annealing furnace.]\r\n\r\nOil furnaces are also made for both high- and low-pressure air,\r\neach having its advocates. The same people also make gas-fired\r\nfurnaces.\r\n\r\nSeveral types of furnaces for various purposes are illustrated\r\nin Fig. 100 and 101. The first is a gas-fired hardening furnace\r\nof the surface-combustion type.\r\n\r\nA large gas-fired annealing furnace of the Maxon system is shown\r\nin Fig. 101. This is large enough for a flat car to be run into\r\nas can be seen. It shows the arrangement of the burners, the track\r\nfor the car and the way in which it fits into the furnace. These\r\nare from the designs of the Industrial Furnace Corporation.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding upon the use of gas or oil, all sides of the problem\r\nshould be considered. Gas is perhaps the nearest ideal but is as a\r\nrule more expensive. The tables compiled by the Gilbert & Barker\r\nManufacturing Company and shown herewith, may help in deciding\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nTABLE 27.--SHOWING COMPARISON OF OIL FUEL WITH VARIOUS GASEOUS FUELS\r\n                                     Heat units\r\n                                    per thousand\r\n                                     cubic feet\r\n  Natural gas                         1,000,000\r\n  Air gas (gas machine) 20 cp           815,500\r\n  Public illuminating gas, average      650,000\r\n  Water gas (from bituminous coal)      377,000\r\n  Water and producer gas, mixed         175,000\r\n  Producer gas                          150,000\r\n\r\nSince a gallon of fuel oil (7 lb.) contains 133,000 heat units, the\r\nfollowing comparisons may evidently be made. At 5 cts. a gallon,\r\nthe equivalent heat units in oil would equal:\r\n\r\n                                     Per thousand\r\n                                      cubic feet\r\n  Natural gas                         at $0.375\r\n  Air gas, 20 cp                      at  0.307\r\n  Public illuminating gas, average    at  0.244\r\n  Water gas (from bituminous coal)    at  0.142\r\n  Water and producer gas, mixed       at  0.065\r\n  Producer gas                        at  0.057\r\n\r\nComparing oil and coal is not always simple as it depends on the\r\nwork to be done and the construction of the furnaces. The variation\r\nrises from 75 to 200 gal. of oil to a ton of coal. For forging\r\nand similar work it is probably safe to consider 100 gal. of oil\r\nas equivalent to a ton of coal.\r\n\r\nThen there is the saving of labor in handling both coal and ashes,\r\nthe waiting for fires to come up, the banking of fires and the dirt\r\nand nuisance generally. The continuous operation possible with\r\noil adds to the output.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing oil and gas it is generally considered that 4-1/2\r\ngal. of fuel oil will give heat equivalent to 1,000 cu. ft. of\r\ncoal gas.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of oil and air used varies with the system installed.\r\nThe low-pressure system maintains a pressure of about 8 oz. on the\r\noil and draws in free air for combustion. Others use a pressure\r\nof several pounds, while gas burners use an average of perhaps\r\n1-1/2 lb. of air to give best results.\r\n\r\nThe weights and volumes of solid fuels are: Anthracite coal, 55 to\r\n65 lb. per cubic foot or 34 to 41 cubic feet per ton; bituminous\r\ncoal, 50 to 55 lb. per cubic foot or 41 to 45 cubic feet per ton;\r\ncoke, 28 lb. per cubic foot or 80 cubic feet per ton--the ton being\r\ncalculated as 2,240 lb. in each case.\r\n\r\nA novel carburizing furnace that is being used by a number of people,\r\nis built after the plan of a fireless cooker. The walls of the\r\nfurnace are extra heavy, and the ports and flues are so arranged\r\nthat when the load in the furnace and the furnace is thoroughly\r\nheated, the burners are shut off and all openings are tightly sealed.\r\nThe carburization then goes on for several hours before the furnace\r\nis cooled below the effective carburizing range, securing an ideal\r\ndiffusion of carbon between the case and the core of the steel\r\nbeing carburized. This is particularly adaptable where simple steel\r\nis used.\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE SCREENS FOR FURNACES\r\n\r\nWorkmen needlessly exposed to the flames, heat and glare from furnaces\r\nwhere high temperatures are maintained suffer in health as well as\r\nin bodily discomfort. This shows several types of shields designed\r\nfor the maximum protection of the furnace worker.\r\n\r\nBad conditions are not necessary; in almost every case means of relief\r\ncan be found by one earnestly seeking them. The larger forge shops\r\nhave adopted flame shields for the majority of their furnaces. Years\r\nago the industrial furnaces (particularly of the oil-burning variety)\r\nwere without shields, but the later models are all shield-equipped.\r\nThese shields are adapted to all of the more modern, heat-treating\r\nfurnaces, as well as to those furnaces in use for working forges;\r\nand attention should be paid to their use on the former type since\r\nthe heat-treating furnaces are constantly becoming more numerous\r\nas manufacturers find need of them in the many phases of munitions\r\nmaking or similar work.\r\n\r\nThe heat that the worker about these furnaces must face may be\r\ndivided in general into two classes: there is first that heat due\r\nto the flame and hot gases that the blast in the furnaces forces\r\nout onto a man's body and face. In the majority of furnaces this\r\nis by far the most discomforting, and care must be taken to fend\r\nit and turn it behind a suitable shield. The second class is the\r\nradiant heat, discharged as light from the glowing interior of\r\nthe furnace. This is the lesser of the two evils so far as general\r\nforging furnaces are concerned, but it becomes the predominating\r\nfeature in furnaces of large door area such as in the usual\r\ncase-hardening furnaces. Here the amount of heat discharged is\r\noften almost unbearable even for a moment. This heat can be taken\r\ncare of by interposing suitable, opaque shields that will temporarily\r\nabsorb it without being destroyed by it, or becoming incandescent.\r\nShould such shields be so constructed as to close off all of the\r\nheat, it might be impossible to work around the furnace for the\r\nremoval of its contents, but they can be made movable, and in such\r\na manner as to shield the major portion of the worker's body.\r\n\r\nFirst taking up the question of flame shields, the illustration,\r\nFig. 102, is a typical installation that shows the main features\r\nfor application to a forging machine or drop-hammer, oil-burning\r\nfurnace, or for an arched-over, coal furnace where the flame blows\r\nout the front. This shield consists of a frame covered with sheet\r\nmetal and held by brackets about 6 in. in front of the furnace.\r\nIt will be noted that slotted holes make this frame adjustable\r\nfor height, and it should be lowered as far as possible when in\r\nuse, so that the work may just pass under it and into the furnace\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\nImmediately below the furnace openings, and close to the furnace\r\nframe will be noted a blast pipe carrying air from the forge-shop\r\nfan. This has a row of small holes drilled in its upper side for\r\nthe entire length, and these direct a curtain of cold air vertically\r\nacross the furnace openings, forcing all of the flame, or a greater\r\nportion of it, to rise behind the shield. Since the shield extends\r\nabove the furnace top there is no escape for this flame until it has\r\npassed high enough to be of no further discomfort to the workman.\r\n\r\nIn this case fan-blast air is used for cooling, and this is cheaper\r\nand more satisfactory because a great volume may be used. However,\r\nwhere high-pressure air is used for atomizing the oil at the burner,\r\nand nothing else is available, this may be employed--though naturally\r\na comparatively small pipe will be needed, in which minute holes\r\nare drilled, else the volume of air used will be too great for\r\nthe compressor economically to supply. Steam may also be employed\r\nfor like service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 102 to 108.--Protective devices for furnace\r\nfronts.]\r\n\r\nThe latest shields of this type are all made double, as illustrated,\r\nwith an inner sheet of metal an inch or two inside of the front.\r\nIn the illustration, _A_, Fig. 102, this inner sheet is smaller,\r\nbut some are now built the same size as the front and bolted to\r\nit with pipe spacers between. The advantage of the double sheet\r\nis that the inner one bears the brunt of the flame, and, if needs\r\nbe, burns up before the outer; while, if due to a heavy fire it\r\nshould be heated red at any point, the outer sheet will still be\r\nmuch cooler and act as an additional shield to the furnace man.\r\n\r\nHEAVY FORGING PRACTICE.--In heavy forging practice where the metal\r\nis being worked at a welding heat, the amount of flame that will\r\nissue from an open-front furnace is so great that a plain, sheet-steel\r\nfront will neither afford sufficient protection nor stand up in\r\nservice. For such a place a water-cooled front is often used. The\r\ngeneral type of this front is illustrated in Fig. 103, and appears to\r\nhave found considerable favor, for numbers of its kind are scattered\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\nIn this case the shield is placed at a slight angle from the vertical,\r\nand along the top edge is a water pipe with a row of small holes\r\nthrough which sprays of water are thrown against it. This water runs\r\ndown in a thin sheet over the shield, cooling it, and is collected\r\nin a trough connected with a run-off pipe at the bottom. The lower\r\nblast-pipe arrangement is similar to the one first described.\r\n\r\nThere are several serious objections to this form of shield that\r\nshould lead to its replacement by a better type; the first is that\r\nwith a very hot fire, portions in the center may become so rapidly\r\nheated that the steam generated will part the sheet of water and\r\ncause it to flow from that point in an inverted V, and that section\r\nwill then quickly become red hot. Another feature is that after\r\nthe water and fire are shut down for the night the heat of the\r\nfurnace can be great enough to cause serious warping of the surface\r\nof the shield so that the water will no longer cover it in a thin,\r\nuniform sheet.\r\n\r\nAfter rigging up a big furnace with a shield of this type several\r\nyears ago, its most serious object was found in the increase of\r\nthe water bill of the plant. This was already of large proportions,\r\nbut it had suddenly jumped to the extent of several hundred dollars.\r\nInvestigation soon disclosed the fact that this water shield was one\r\nof the main causes of the added cost of water. A little estimating\r\nof the amount of water that can flow through a 1/2-in. pipe under\r\n30-lb. pressure, in the course of a day, will show that this amount\r\nat 10 cts. per 1,000 gal., can count up rather rapidly.\r\n\r\nFigure 103 is a section through a portion of the furnace front and\r\nshield showing all of the principal parts. This shield consists\r\nessentially of a very thin tank, about 2-1/2 in. between walls,\r\nand filled with water. Like other shields it is fitted with an\r\nadjustment, that it may be raised and lowered as the work demands.\r\nThe tank having an open top, the water as it absorbs heat from\r\nthe flame will simply boil away in steam; and only a small amount\r\nwill have to be added to make up for that which has evaporated. The\r\nwater-feed pipe shown at _F_ ends a short distance above the top\r\nof the tank so that just how much water is running in may readily\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nAn overflow pipe is provided at _O_ which aids in maintaining the\r\nwater at the proper height, as a sufficient quantity can always be\r\npermitted to run in, to avoid any possibility of the shield ever\r\nboiling dry; at the same time the small excess can run off without\r\ndanger of an overflow. The shield illustrated in Fig. 104 has been\r\nin constant use for over two years, giving greater satisfaction\r\nthan any other of which the writer has known. It might also be\r\nnoted that this shield was made with riveted joints, the shop not\r\nhaving a gas-welding outfit. To flange over the edges and then\r\nweld them with an acetylene torch would be a far more economical\r\nprocedure, and would also insure a tight and permanent joint.\r\n\r\nThe water-cooled front shown in Fig. 105 is an absurd effort to\r\naccomplish the design of a furnace that will provide cool working\r\nconditions. This front was on a bolt-heating furnace using hard\r\ncoal for fuel; and it may be seen that it takes the place of all\r\nof the brickwork that should be on that side. Had this been nothing\r\nmore than a very narrow water-cooled frame, with brickwork below\r\nand supporting bricks above, put in like the tuyeres in a foundry\r\ncupola, the case would have been somewhat different, for then it\r\nwould have absorbed a smaller proportion of the heat.\r\n\r\nA blacksmith who knows how a piece of cold iron laid in a small\r\nwelding furnace momentarily lowers the temperature, will appreciate\r\nthe enormous amount of extra heat that must be maintained in the\r\ncentral portion of this furnace to make up for the constant chilling\r\neffect of the cold wall. Moreover, since there would have been\r\nserious trouble had steam generated in this front, a steady stream\r\nof water had to be run through it constantly to insure against\r\nan approach to the boiling point. This is illustrated because of\r\nits absurdity, and as a warning of something to avoid.\r\n\r\nWater-cooled, tuyere openings, as mentioned above, which support\r\nbrick side-walls of the furnace, have proved successful for coal\r\nfurnaces used for forging machine and drop-hammer heating, since\r\nthey permit a great amount of work to be handled through their\r\nopenings without wearing away as would a brick arch. Great care\r\nshould be exercised properly to design them so that a minimum amount\r\nof the cold tuyere will be in contact with the interior of the\r\nfurnace, and all interior portions possible should be covered by\r\nthe bricks. However, a discussion of these points will hardly come\r\nin the flame-shield class, although they can be made to do a great\r\ndeal toward relieving the excessive heat to be borne by the furnace\r\nworker.\r\n\r\nFLANGE SHIELDS FOR FURNACES.--Such portable flame shields as the\r\none illustrated in Fig. 106 may prove serviceable before furnaces\r\nrequired for plate work, where the doors are often only opened\r\nfor a moment at a time. This shield can be placed far enough in\r\nfront of the furnace, that it will be possible to work under it\r\nor around it, in removing bulky work from the furnace, and yet\r\nit will afford the furnace tender some relief from the excessive\r\nglare that will come out the wide-opened door. To have this shield\r\nof light weight so that it may be readily pushed aside when not\r\nwanted, the frame may be made up of pipe and fittings, and a piece\r\nof thin sheet steel fastened in the panel by rings about the frame.\r\n\r\nAbout the most disagreeable task in a heat-treating shop is the\r\nremoval of the pots from the case-hardening furnaces; these must\r\nbe handled at a bright red heat in order that their contents may be\r\ndumped into the quenching tank with a minimum-time contact with the\r\nair, and before they have cooled sufficiently to require reheating.\r\nFacing the heat before the large open doors of the majority of\r\nthese furnaces, in a man-killing task even when the weather is\r\nmoderately cool. The boxes soon become more or less distorted,\r\nand then even the best of lifting devices will not remove a hot\r\npot without several minutes labor in front of the doors.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 107 is shown a method of arranging a shield on one type of\r\ncharging and removing truck. This shield cannot afford more than\r\na partial protection to the body of the furnace tender, because\r\nhe must be able to see around it, and in some cases even push it\r\npartly through the door of the furnace, but even small as it is it\r\nmay still afford some welcome protection. The great advantage in\r\nthis case of having the shield on the truck instead of stationary\r\nin front of the furnace, is that it still affords protection as\r\nlong as the hot pot is being handled through the shop on its way\r\nto the quenching tank.\r\n\r\nIt might be interesting to many engaged in the heat-treating or\r\ncase hardening of steel parts, to make a special note of the design\r\nof the truck that is illustrated in connection with the shield;\r\nthe general form is shown although the actual details for the\r\nconstruction of such a truck are lacking; these being simple, may be\r\nreadily worked out by anyone wishing to build one. This is considered\r\nto be one of the quickest and easiest operated devices for the\r\nremoval of this class of work from the furnace. To be sure it may\r\nonly be used where the floor of the furnace has been built level\r\nwith the floor of the room, but many of the modern furnaces of\r\nthis class are so designed.\r\n\r\nThe pack-hardening pots are cast with legs, from two to three inches\r\nhigh, to permit the circulation of the hot gases, and so heat more\r\nquickly. Between these legs and under the body of the pot, the two\r\nforward prongs of the truck are pushed, tilting the outer handle\r\nto make these prongs as low as possible. The handle is then lowered\r\nand, as it has a good leverage, the pot is easily raised from the\r\nfloor, and the truck and its load rolled out.\r\n\r\nHEATING OF MANGANESE STEEL.--Another form of heat-treating furnace\r\nis that which is used for the heating of manganese and other alloy\r\nsteels, which after having been brought to the proper heat are drawn\r\nfrom the furnace into an immediate quenching tank. With manganese\r\nsteel in particular, the parts are so fragile and easily damaged\r\nwhile hot that it is frequent practice to have a sloping platform\r\nimmediately in front of the furnace door down which the castings\r\nmay slide into a tank below the floor level. Such a furnace with\r\na quenching tank in front of its door is shown in Fig. 108.\r\n\r\nThese tanks are covered with plates while charging the furnace\r\nand the cold castings are placed in a moderately cool furnace.\r\nSince some of these steels must not be charged into a furnace where\r\nthe heat is extreme but should be brought up to their final heat\r\ngradually, there is little discomfort during the charging process.\r\nWhen quenching, however, from a temperature of 1,800° to 1,900°,\r\nit is extremely unpleasant in front of the doors. The swinging\r\nshield is here adapted to give protection for this work. As will\r\nbe noted it is hung a sufficient distance in front of the doors,\r\nthat it may not interfere with the castings as they come from the\r\nfurnace, and slide down into the tank.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the work, and avoid the necessity of working with\r\nthe bars outside the edges of the shield, the slot-like hole is\r\ncut in the center of the shield, and through this the bars or rakes\r\nfor dragging out the castings are easily inserted and manipulated.\r\nThe advantage of such a swinging shield is that it may be readily\r\nmoved from side to side, or forward and back as occasion requires.\r\n\r\nFURNACE DATA\r\n\r\nIn order to give definite information concerning furnaces, fuels\r\netc., the following data is quoted from a paper by Seth A. Moulton\r\nand W. H. Lyman before the Steel Heat Treaters Society in September,\r\n1920.\r\n\r\nThis considers a factory producing 30,000 lb. of automobile gears\r\nper 24 hr. The transmission gears will be of high-carbon steel and\r\nthe differential of low-carbon steel, carburized. The heat-treating\r\nequipment required is:\r\n\r\n  1. Annealing furnaces      1,400 to 1,600°F.\r\n  2. Carburizing furnaces    1,700 to 1,800°F.\r\n  3. Hardening furnaces      1,450 to 1,550°F.\r\n  4. Drawing furnaces          350 to   950°F.\r\n\r\nAll of the forging blanks are annealed before machining, about\r\nthree-quarters of the machined gears and parts are carburized,\r\nall the carburized gears are given a double treatment for core and\r\ncase, all gears and parts are hardened and all parts are drawn.\r\n\r\nThe possible sources of heat supply and their values are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. Oil                 140,000 B.t.u. per gallon\r\n  2. Natural gas           1,100 B.t.u. per cubic foot\r\n  3. City gas                650 B.t.u. per cubic foot\r\n  4. Water gas               300 B.t.u. per cubic foot\r\n  5. Producer gas            170 B.t.u. per cubic foot\r\n  6. Coal                 12,000 B.t.u. per pound\r\n  7. Electric current      3,412 B.t.u. per kilowatt-hour\r\n\r\nFor the heat treatment specified only comparatively low temperatures\r\nare required. No difficulty will be experienced in attaining the\r\ndesired maximum temperature of 1,800°F. with any of the heating\r\nmedium above enumerated; but it should be noted that the producer\r\ngas with a B.t.u. content of 170 per cubic foot and the electric\r\ncurrent would require _specially_ designed furnaces to obtain higher\r\ntemperatures than 1800°F.\r\n\r\nTABLE 28.--COMPARATTVE OPERATING COSTS\r\n\r\nAssuming\r\n  Cost of oil- and gas-fired furnaces\r\n    installed as                           $100.00 per square foot of hearth\r\n  Cost of coal-fired furnace installed as   150.00 per square foot of hearth\r\n  Cost of electric furnace 100 kw.\r\n    capacity installed as                    90.00 per kilowatt\r\n  Cost of electric furnace 150 kw.\r\n    capacity installed as                    70.00 per kilowatt\r\n\r\nOutput 3,000 lb. charge, 8 hr. heat carburizing, 2 hr. heating\r\nonly.

necessary for one engaged\r\nin the heat treatment of steel. It is only by careful measurement\r\nand control of the heating of steel that the full benefit of a\r\nheat-treating operation is secured.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of the thermo-couple, methods of temperature\r\nmeasurement were very crude. The blacksmith depended on his eyes\r\nto tell him when the proper temperature was reached, and of course\r\nthe \"color\" appeared different on light or dark days. \"Cherry\"\r\nto one man was \"orange\" to another, and it was therefore almost\r\nimpossible to formulate any treatment which could be applied by\r\nseveral men to secure the same results.\r\n\r\nOne of the early methods of measuring temperatures was the \"iron\r\nball\" method. In this method, an iron ball, to which a wire was\r\nattached, was placed in the furnace and when it had reached the\r\ntemperature of the furnace, it was quickly removed by means of\r\nthe wire, and suspended in a can containing a known quantity of\r\nwater; the volume of water being such that the heat would not cause\r\nit to boil. The rise in temperature of the water was measured by a\r\nthermometer, and, knowing the heat capacity of the iron ball and\r\nthat of the water, the temperature of the ball, and therefore the\r\nfurnace, could be calculated. Usually a set of tables was prepared\r\nto simplify the calculations. The iron ball, however, scaled, and\r\nchanged in weight with repeated use, making the determinations\r\nless and less accurate. A copper ball was often used to decrease\r\nthis change, but even that was subject to error. This method is\r\nstill sometimes used, but for uniform results, a platinum ball,\r\nwhich will not scale or change in weight, is necessary, and the\r\ncost of this ball, together with the slowness of the method, have\r\nrendered the practice obsolete, especially in view of modern\r\ndevelopments in accurate pyrometry.\r\n\r\nPYROMETERS\r\n\r\nArmor plate makers sometimes use the copper ball or Siemens' water\r\npyrometer because they can place a number of the balls or weights on\r\nthe plate in locations where it is difficult to use other pyrometers.\r\nOne of these pyrometers is shown in section in Fig. 109.\r\n\r\nSIEMENS' WATER PYROMETER.--It consists of a cylindrical copper vessel\r\nprovided with a handle and containing a second smaller copper vessel\r\nwith double walls. An air space _a_ separates the two vessels, and\r\na layer of felt the two walls of the inner one, in order to retard\r\nthe exchange of temperature with the surroundings. The capacity\r\nof the inner vessel is a little more than one pint. A mercury\r\nthermometer _b_ is fixed close to the wall of the inner vessel,\r\nits lower part being protected by a perforated brass tube, whilst\r\nthe upper projects above the vessel and is divided as usual on the\r\nstem into degrees, Fahrenheit or Centigrade, as desired. At the\r\nside of the thermometer there is a small brass scale _c_, which\r\nslides up and down, and on which the high temperatures are marked\r\nin the same degrees as those in which the mercury thermometer is\r\ndivided; on a level with the zero division of the brass scale a\r\nsmall pointer is fixed, which traverses the scale of the thermometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Siemens' copper-ball pyrometer.]\r\n\r\nShort cylinders _d_, of either copper, iron or platinum, are supplied\r\nwith the pyrometer, which are so adjusted that their heat capacity at\r\nordinary temperature is equal to one-fiftieth of that of the copper\r\nvessel filled with one pint of water. As, however, the specific heat\r\nof metals increases with the temperature, allowance is made on the\r\nbrass sliding scales, which are divided according to the metal used\r\nfor the pyrometer cylinder _d_. It will therefore be understood that\r\na different sliding scale is required for the particular kind of\r\nmetal of which a cylinder is composed. In order to obtain accurate\r\nmeasurements, each sliding scale must be used only in conjunction\r\nwith its own thermometer, and in case the latter breaks a new scale\r\nmust be made and graduated for the new thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe water pyrometer is used as follows:\r\n\r\nExactly one pint (0.568 liter) of clean water, perfectly distilled\r\nor rain water, is poured into the copper vessel, and the pyrometer\r\nis left for a few minutes to allow the thermometer to attain the\r\ntemperature of the water.\r\n\r\nThe brass scale _c_ is then set with its pointer opposite the\r\ntemperature of the water as shown by the thermometer. Meanwhile\r\none of the metal cylinders has been exposed to the high temperature\r\nwhich is to be measured, and after allowing sufficient time for\r\nit to acquire that temperature, it is rapidly removed and dropped\r\ninto the pyrometer vessel without splashing any of the water out.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the water will rise until, after a little while,\r\nthe mercury of the thermometer has become stationary. When this\r\nis observed the degrees of the thermometer are read off, as well\r\nas those on the brass scale _c_ opposite the top of the mercury.\r\nThe sum of these two values together gives the temperature of the\r\nflue, furnace or other heated space in which the metal cylinder\r\nhad been placed. With cylinders of copper and iron, temperatures up\r\nto 1,800°F. (1,000°C.) can be measured, but with platinum cylinders\r\nthe limit is 2,700°F. (1,500°C.).\r\n\r\nFor ordinary furnace work either copper or wrought-iron cylinders\r\nmay be used. Iron cylinders possess a higher melting point and have\r\nless tendency to scale than those of copper, but the latter are\r\nmuch less affected by the corrosive action of the furnace gases;\r\nplatinum is, of course, not subject to any of these disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe weight to which the different metal cylinders are adjusted is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Copper          137.0 grams\r\n  Wrought-iron    112.0 grams\r\n  Platinum        402.6 grams\r\n\r\nIn course of time the cylinders lose weight by scaling; but tables\r\nare provided giving multipliers for the diminished weights, by\r\nwhich the reading on the brass scale should be multiplied.\r\n\r\nTHE THERMO-COUPLE\r\n\r\nWith the application of the thermo-couple, the measurement of\r\ntemperatures, between, say, 700 and 2,500°F., was made more simple\r\nand precise. The theory of the thermo-couple is simple; it is that\r\nif two bars, rods, or wires of different metals are joined together\r\nat their ends, when heated so that one junction is hotter than the\r\nother, an electromotive force is set up through the metals, which\r\nwill increase with the increase of the _difference_ of temperature\r\nbetween the two junctions. This electromotive force, or voltage, may\r\nbe measured, and, from a chart previously prepared, the temperature\r\ndetermined. In most pyrometers, of course, the temperatures are\r\ninscribed directly on the voltmeter, but the fact remains that\r\nit is the voltage of a small electric current, and not heat, that\r\nis actually measured.\r\n\r\nThere are two common types of thermo-couples, the first making use\r\nof common, inexpensive metals, such as iron wire and nichrome wire.\r\nThis is the so-called \"base metal\" couple. The other is composed of\r\nexpensive metals such as platinum wire, and a wire of an alloy of\r\nplatinum with 10 per cent of rhodium or iridium. This is called\r\nthe \"rare metal\" couple, and because its component metals are less\r\naffected by heat, it lasts longer, and varies less than the base\r\nmetal couple.\r\n\r\nThe cold junction of a thermo-couple may be connected by means\r\nof copper wires to the voltmeter, although in some installations\r\nof base metal couples, the wires forming the couple are themselves\r\nextended to the voltmeter, making copper connections unnecessary.\r\nFrom the foregoing, it may be seen that accurately to measure the\r\ntemperature of the hot end of a thermo-couple, we _must know the\r\ntemperature of the cold end_, as it is the _difference_ in the\r\ntemperatures that determines the voltmeter readings. This is absolutely\r\nessential for precision, and its importance cannot be over-emphasized.\r\n\r\nWhen pyrometers are used in daily operation, they should be checked\r\nor calibrated two or three times a month, or even every week. Where\r\nthere are many in use, it is good practice to have a master pyrometer\r\nof a rare metal couple, which is used only for checking up the\r\nothers. The master pyrometer, after calibrating against the melting\r\npoints of various substances, will have a calibration chart which\r\nshould be used in the checking operation.\r\n\r\nIt is customary now to send a rare metal couple to the Bureau of\r\nStandards at Washington, where it is very carefully calibrated\r\nfor a nominal charge, and returned with the voltmeter readings\r\nof a series of temperatures covering practically the whole range\r\nof the couple. This couple is then used only for checking those\r\nin daily use.\r\n\r\nPyrometer couples are more or less expensive, and should be cared\r\nfar when in use. The wires of the couple should be insulated from\r\neach other by fireclay leads or tubes, and it is well to encase them\r\nin a fireclay, porcelain, or quartz tube to keep out the furnace\r\ngases, which in time destroy the hot junction. This tube of fireclay,\r\nor porcelain, etc., should be protected against breakage by an\r\niron or nichrome tube, plugged or welded at the hot end. These\r\nsimple precautions will prolong the life of a couple and maintain\r\nits precision longer.\r\n\r\nSometimes erroneous temperatures are recorded because the \"cold\r\nend\" of the couple is too near the furnace and gets hot. This always\r\ncauses a temperature reading lower than the actual, and should be\r\nguarded against. It is well to keep the cold end cool with water,\r\na wet cloth, or by placing it where coal air will circulate around\r\nit. Best of all, is to have the cold junction in a box, together\r\nwith a thermometer, so that its temperature may definitely be known.\r\nIf this temperature should rise 20°F. on a hot day, a correction of\r\n20°F. should be added to the pyrometer reading, and so on. In the\r\nmost up-to-date installations, this cold junction compensation is\r\ntaken care of automatically, a fact which indicates its importance.\r\n\r\nOptical pyrometers are often used where it is impracticable to\r\nuse the thermo-couple, either because the temperature is so high\r\nthat it would destroy the couple, or the heat to be measured is\r\ninaccessible to the couple of ordinary length. The temperatures of\r\nslag or metal in furnaces or running through tap-holes or troughs\r\nare often measured with optical pyrometers.\r\n\r\nIn one type of optical pyrometer, the observer focuses it on the\r\nmetal or slag and moves an adjustable dial or gage so as to get\r\nan exact comparison between the color of the heat measured with\r\nthe calor of a lamp or screen in the pyrometer itself. This, of\r\ncourse, requires practice, and judgment, and brings in the personal\r\nequation. With care, however, very reliable temperature measurements\r\nmay be made. The temperatures of rails, as they leave the finishing\r\npass of a rolling mill, are measured in this way.\r\n\r\nAnother type of optical pyrometer is focused on the body, the\r\ntemperature of which is to be measured. The rays converge in the\r\ntelescope on metal cells, heating them, and thereby generating a\r\nsmall electric current, the voltage of which is read an a calibrated\r\nvoltmeter similar to that used with the thermo-couple. The best\r\nprecision is obtained when an optical pyrometer is used each time\r\nunder similar conditions of light and the same observer.\r\n\r\nWhere it is impracticable to use either thermo-couples or optical\r\npyrometers, \"sentinels\" may be used. There are small cones or cylinders\r\nmade of salts or other substances of known melting points and covering\r\na wide range of temperatures.\r\n\r\nIf six of these \"sentinels,\" melting respectively at 1,300°, 1,350°,\r\n1,400°, 1,450°, 1,500°, and 1,550°F., were placed in a row in a\r\nfurnace, together with a piece of steel to be treated, and the\r\nwhole heated up uniformly, the sentinels would melt one by one and\r\nthe observer, by watching them through an opening in the furnace,\r\ncould tell when his furnace is at say 1,500° or between 1,500° and\r\n1,550°, and regulate the heat accordingly.\r\n\r\nA very accurate type of pyrometer, but one not so commonly used as\r\nthose previously described, is the resistance pyrometer. In this\r\ntype, the temperature is determined by measuring the resistance to an\r\nelectric current of a wire which is at the heat to be measured. This\r\nwire is usually of platinum, wound around a quartz tube, the whole\r\nbeing placed in the furnace. When the wire is at the temperature of\r\nthe furnace, it is connected by wires with a Wheatstone Bridge, a\r\ndelicate device for measuring electrical resistance, and an electric\r\ncurrent is passed through the wire. This current is balanced by\r\nswitching in resistances in the Wheatstone Bridge, until a delicate\r\nelectrical device shows that no current is flowing. The resistance\r\nof the platinum wire at the heat to be measured is thus determined\r\non the \"Bridge,\" and the temperature read off on a calibration\r\nchart, which shows the resistance at various temperatures.\r\n\r\nThese are the common methods used to-day for measuring temperatures,\r\nbut whatever method is used, the observer should bear in mind that\r\nthe greatest precision is obtained, and hence the highest efficiency,\r\nby keeping the apparatus in good working order, making sure that\r\nconditions are the same each time, and calibrating or checking\r\nagainst a standard at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nTHE PYROMETER AND ITS USE\r\n\r\nIn the heat treatment of steel, it has become absolutely necessary\r\nthat a measuring instrument be used which will give the operator an\r\nexact reading of heat in furnace. There are a number of instruments\r\nand devices manufactured for this purpose but any instrument that\r\nwill not give a direct reading without any guess work should have\r\nno place in the heat-treating department.\r\n\r\nA pyrometer installation is very simple and any of the leading\r\nmakers will furnish diagrams for the correct wiring and give detailed\r\ninformation as to the proper care of, and how best to use their\r\nparticular instrument. There are certain general principles, however,\r\nthat must be observed by the operators and it cannot be too strongly\r\nimpressed upon them that the human factor involved is always the\r\ndeciding factor in the heat treatment of steel.\r\n\r\nA pyrometer is merely an aid in the performance of doing good work,\r\nand when carefully observed will help in giving a uniformity of\r\nproduct and act as a check on careless operators. The operator\r\nmust bear in mind that although the reading on the pyrometer scale\r\ngives a measure of the temperature where the junction of the two\r\nmetals is located, it will not give the temperature at the center\r\nof work in the furnace, unless by previous tests, the heat for\r\npenetrating a certain bulk of material has been decided on, and\r\nthe time necessary for such penetration is known.\r\n\r\nEach analysis of plain carbon or alloy steel is a problem in itself.\r\nIts critical temperatures will be located at slightly different\r\nheats than for a steel which has a different proportion of alloying\r\nelements. Furthermore, it takes time for metal to acquire the heat\r\nof the furnace. Even the outer surface lags behind the temperature\r\nof the furnace somewhat, and the center of the piece of steel lags\r\nstill further. It is apparent, therefore, that temperature, although\r\nimportant, does not tell the whole story in heat treatment. _Time_\r\nis also a factor.\r\n\r\nTime at temperature is also of great importance because it takes\r\ntime, after the temperature has been reached, for the various internal\r\nchanges to take place. Hence the necessity for \"soaking,\" when\r\nannealing or normalizing. Therefore, a clock is as necessary to\r\nthe proper pyrometer equipment as the pyrometer itself.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of general work where a wide range of steels or\r\na variable treatment is called for, it becomes necessary to have\r\nthe pyrometer calibrated constantly, and when no master instrument\r\nis kept for this purpose the following method can be used to give\r\nthe desired results:\r\n\r\nCALIBRATION OF PYROMETER WITH COMMON SALT\r\n\r\nAn easy and convenient method for standardization and one which\r\ndoes not necessitate the use of an expensive laboratory equipment\r\nis that based upon determining the melting point of common table\r\nsalt (sodium chloride). While theoretically salt that is chemically\r\npure should be used (and this is neither expensive nor difficult\r\nto procure), commercial accuracy may be obtained by using common\r\ntable salt such as is sold by every grocer. The salt is melted in\r\na clean crucible of fireclay, iron or nickel, either in a furnace\r\nor over a forge-fire, and then further heated until a temperature\r\nof about 1,600 to 1,650°F. is attained. It is essential that this\r\ncrucible be clean because a slight admixture of a foreign substance\r\nmight noticeably change the melting point.\r\n\r\nThe thermo-couple to be calibrated is then removed from its protecting\r\ntube and its hot end is immersed in the salt bath. When this end\r\nhas reached the temperature of the bath, the crucible is removed\r\nfrom the source of heat and allowed to cool, and cooling readings\r\nare then taken every 10 sec. on the milli-voltmeter or pyrometer. A\r\ncurve is then plotted by using time and temperature as coördinates,\r\nand the temperature of the freezing point of salt, as indicated\r\nby this particular thermocouple, is noted, _i.e._, at the point\r\nwhere the temperature of the bath remains temporarily constant\r\nwhile the salt is freezing. The length of time during which the\r\ntemperature is stationary depends on the size of the bath and the\r\nrate of cooling, and is not a factor in the calibration. The melting\r\npoint of salt is 1,472°F., and the needed correction for the instrument\r\nunder observation can be readily applied.\r\n\r\nIt should not be understood from the above, however, that the salt-bath\r\ncalibration cannot be made without plotting a curve; in actual\r\npractice at least a hundred tests are made without plotting any curve\r\nto one in which it is done. The observer, if awake, may reasonably\r\nbe expected to have sufficient appreciation of the lapse of time\r\ndefinitely to observe the temperature at which the falling pointer\r\nof the instrument halts. The gradual dropping of the pointer before\r\nfreezing, unless there is a large mass of salt, takes place rapidly\r\nenough for one to be sure that the temperature is constantly falling,\r\nand the long period of rest during freezing is quite definite.\r\nThe procedure of detecting the solidification point of the salt\r\nby the hesitation of the pointer without plotting any curve is\r\nsuggested because of its simplicity.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE CALIBRATION OF PYROMETERS.--For the complete calibration\r\nof a thermo-couple of unknown electromotive force, the new couple\r\nmay be checked against a standard instrument, placing the two bare\r\ncouples side by side in a suitable tube and taking frequent readings\r\nover the range of temperatures desired.\r\n\r\nIf only one instrument, such as a millivoltmeter, is available,\r\nand there is no standard couple at hand, the new couple may be\r\ncalibrated over a wide range of temperatures by the use of the following\r\nstandards:\r\n\r\n  Water, boiling point                        212°F.\r\n  Tin, under charcoal, freezing point         450°F.\r\n  Lead, under charcoal, freezing point        621°F.\r\n  Zinc, under charcoal, freezing point        786°F.\r\n  Sulphur, boiling point                      832°F.\r\n  Aluminum, under charcoal, freezing point  1,216°F.\r\n  Sodium chloride (salt), freezing point    1,474°F.\r\n  Potassium sulphate, freezing point        1,958°F.\r\n\r\nA good practice is to make one pyrometer a standard; calibrate it\r\nfrequently by the melting-point-of-salt method, and each morning\r\ncheck up every pyrometer in the works with the standard, making the\r\nnecessary corrections to be used for the day's work. By pursuing\r\nthis course systematically, the improved quality of the product\r\nwill much more than compensate for the extra work.\r\n\r\nThe purity of the substance affects its freezing or melting point.\r\nThe melting point of common salt is given in one widely used handbook\r\nat 1,421°F., although chemically pure sodium chloride melts at\r\n1,474°F. as shown above. A sufficient quantity for an extended\r\nperiod should be secured. Test the melting point with a pyrometer\r\nof known accuracy. Knowing this temperature it will be easy to\r\ncalibrate other pyrometers.\r\n\r\nPLACING OF PYROMETERS.--When installing a pyrometer, care should be\r\ntaken that it reaches directly to the point desired to be measured,\r\nthat the cold junction is kept cold, and that the wires leading to\r\nthe recording instrument are kept in good shape. The length of\r\nthese lead wires have an effect; the longer they are, the lower\r\nthe apparent temperature.\r\n\r\nWhen pyrometers placed in a number of furnaces are connected up\r\nin series, and a multiple switch is used for control, it becomes\r\napparent that pyrometers could not be interchanged between furnaces\r\nnear and far from the instrument without affecting the uniformity\r\nof product from each furnace.\r\n\r\nCalibration can best be done without disturbing the working pyrometer,\r\nby inserting the master instrument into each furnace separately, place\r\nit alongside the hot junction of the working pyrometer, and compare\r\nthe reading given on the indicator connected with the multiple\r\nswitch.\r\n\r\nProtection tubes should be replaced when cracked, as it is important\r\nthat no foreign substance is allowed to freeze in the tube, so\r\nthat the enclosed junction becomes a part of a solid mass joined\r\nin electrical contact with the outside protecting tube. Wires over\r\nthe furnaces must be carefully inspected from time to time, as no\r\ntrue reading can be had on an instrument, if insulation is burned\r\noff and short circuits result.\r\n\r\nIf the standard calibrating instrument used contains a dry battery,\r\nit should be examined from time to time to be sure it is in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nTHE LEEDS AND NORTHRUP POTENTIOMETER SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe potentiometer pyrometer system is both flexible and substantial\r\nin that it is not affected by the jar and vibration of the factory\r\nor the forge shop. Large or small couples, long or short leads\r\ncan be used without adjustment. The recording instrument may be\r\nplaced where it is most convenient, without regard to the distance\r\nfrom the furnace.\r\n\r\nITS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE.--The potentiometer is the electrical\r\nequivalent of the chemical balance, or balance arm scales. Measurements\r\nare made with balance scales by varying known weights until they\r\nequal the unknown weight. When the two are equal the scales stand\r\nat zero, that is, in the position which they occupy when there is\r\nno weight on either pan; the scales are then said to be balanced.\r\nMeasurements are made with the potentiometer by varying a known\r\nelectromotive force until it equals the unknown; when the two are\r\nequal the index of the potentiometer, the galvanometer needle,\r\nstands motionless as it is alternately connected and disconnected.\r\nThe variable known weights are units separate from the scales, but\r\nthe potentiometer provides its own variable known electromotive\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThe potentiometer provides, first, a means of securing a known\r\nvariable electromotive force and, second, suitable electrical\r\nconnections for bringing that electromotive force to a point where\r\nit may be balanced against the unknown electromotive force of the\r\ncouple. The two are connected with opposite polarity, or so that\r\nthe two e.m.f.s oppose one another. So long as one is stronger\r\nthan the other a current will flow through the couple; when the\r\ntwo are equal no current will flow.\r\n\r\nFigure 107 shows the wiring of the potentiometer in its simplest\r\nform. The thermo-couple is at _H_, with its polarity as shown by\r\nthe symbols + and -. It is connected with the main circuit of the\r\npotentiometer at the fixed point _D_ and the point _G_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--Simple potentiometer.]\r\n\r\nA current from the dry cell _Ba_ is constantly flowing through the\r\nmain, or so-called potentiometer circuit, _ABCDGEF_. The section\r\n_DGE_ of this circuit is a slide wire, uniform in resistance throughout\r\nits length. The scale is fixed on this slide wire. The current\r\nfrom the cell _Ba_ as it flows through _DGE_, undergoes a fall\r\nin potential, setting up a difference in voltage, that is, an\r\nelectromotive force, between _D_ and _E_. There will also be\r\nelectromotive force between _D_ and all other points on the slide\r\nwire. The polarity of this is in opposition to the polarity of the\r\nthermo-couple which connects into the potentiometer at _D_ and\r\nat _G_. By moving _G_ along the slide wire a point is found where\r\nthe voltage between _D_ and _G_ in the slide wire is just equal to\r\nthe voltage between _D_ and _G_ generated by the thermo-couple. A\r\ngalvanometer in the thermo-couple circuit indicates when the balance\r\npoint is reached, since at this point the galvanometer needle will\r\nstand motionless when its circuit is opened and closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--Standard cell potentiometer.]\r\n\r\nThe voltage in the slide wire will vary with the current flowing\r\nthrough it from the cell _Ba_ and a means of standardizing this is\r\nprovided. _SC_, Fig. 111, is a cadmium cell whose voltage is constant.\r\nIt is connected at two points _C_ and _D_ to the potentiometer\r\ncircuit whenever the potentiometer current is to be standardized.\r\nAt this time the galvanometer is thrown in series with _SC_. The\r\nvariable rheostat _R_ is then adjusted until the current flowing\r\nis such that as it flows through the standard resistance _CD_,\r\nthe fall in potential between _C_ and _D_ is just equal to the\r\nvoltage of the standard cell _SC_. At this time the galvanometer\r\nwill indicate a balance in the same way as when it was used with\r\na thermo-couple. By this operation the current in the slide wire\r\n_DGE_ has been standardized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Hand adjusted cold-end compensator.]\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE WIRING SCHEME OF THE COLD-END COMPENSATOR.--The\r\nnet voltage generated by a thermo-couple depends upon the temperature\r\nof the hot end and the temperature of the cold end. Therefore, any\r\nmethod adopted for reading temperature by means of thermo-couples\r\nmust in some way provide a means of correcting for the temperature of\r\nthe cold end. The potentiometer may have either of two very simple\r\ndevices for this purpose. In one form the operator is required\r\nto set a small index to a point on a scale corresponding to the\r\nknown cold junction temperature. In the other form an even more\r\nsimple automatic compensator is employed. The principle of each is\r\ndescribed in the succeeding paragraphs, in which the assumption is\r\nmade that the reader already understands the potentiometer principle\r\nas described above.\r\n\r\nAs previously explained the voltage of the thermo-couple is measured\r\nby balancing it against the voltage drop _DG_ in the potentiometer.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Fig. 111, the magnitude of the balancing voltage is\r\ncontrolled by the position of _G_. Make _D_ movable as shown in Fig.\r\n112 and the magnitude of the voltage _DG_ may be varied either from\r\nthe point _D_ or the point _G_. This gives a means of compensating\r\nfor cold end changes by setting the slider _D_. As the cold end\r\ntemperature rises the net voltage generated by the couple decreases,\r\nassuming the hot end temperature to be constant. To balance this\r\ndecreased voltage the slider _D_ is moved along its scale to a new\r\npoint nearer _G_. In other words, the slider _D_ is moved along\r\nits scale until it corresponds to the known temperature of the cold\r\nend and then the potentiometer is balanced by moving the slider\r\n_G_. The readings of _G_ will then be direct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Another type of compensator.]\r\n\r\nThe same results will be obtained if a slide wire upon which _D_\r\nbears is in parallel with the slide wire of _G_, as shown in Fig.\r\n113.\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC COMPENSATOR.--It should be noted that the effect of moving\r\nthe contact _D_, Fig. 113, is to vary the ratio of the resistances\r\non the two sides of the point _D_ in the secondary slide wire. In\r\nthe recording pyrometers, an automatic compensator is employed.\r\nThis automatic compensator varies the ratio on the two sides of\r\nthe point _D_ in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThe point _D_, Fig. 114, is mechanically fixed; on one side of\r\n_D_ is the constant resistance coil _M_, on the other the nickel\r\ncoil _N_. _N_ is placed at or near the cold end of the thermo-couple\r\n(or couples). Nickel has a high temperature coefficient and the\r\nelectrical proportions of _M_ and _N_ are such that the resistance\r\nchange of _N_, as it varies with the temperature of the cold end,\r\nhas the same effect upon the balancing voltage between _D_ and\r\n_G_ that the movement of the point _D_, Fig. 114, has in the\r\nhand-operated compensator.\r\n\r\nInstruments embodying these principles are shown in Figs. 115 to\r\n117. The captions making their uses clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--Automatic cold-end compensator.]\r\n\r\nPLACING THE THERMO-COUPLES\r\n\r\nThe following illustrations from the Taylor Instrument Company\r\nshow different applications of the thermo-couples to furnaces of\r\nvarious kinds. Figure 118 shows an oil-fired furnace with a simple\r\nvertical installation. Figure 119 shows a method of imbedding the\r\nthermo-couple in the floor of a furnace so as to require no space\r\nin the heating chamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Potentiometer ready for use.]\r\n\r\nVarious methods of applying a pyrometer to common heat-treatment\r\nfurnaces are shown in Figs. 120 to 122.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Eight-point recording pyrometer-Carpenter\r\nSteel Co.]\r\n\r\nLEEDS AND NORTHRUP OPTICAL PYROMETER\r\n\r\nThe principles of this very popular method of measuring temperature\r\nare sketched in Fig. 123.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Multiple-point thermocouple\r\nrecorder--Bethlehem Steel Co.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Tycos pyrometer in oil-fired furnace.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument is light and portable, and can be sighted as easily\r\nas an opera glass. The telescope, which is held in the hand, weighs\r\nonly 25 oz.; and the case containing the battery, rheostat and\r\nmilliammeter, which is slung from the shoulder, only 10 lb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Thermocouple in floor of furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Pyrometer in gas furnace.]\r\n\r\nA large surface to sight at is not required. So long as the image\r\nformed by the objective is broader than the lamp filament, the\r\ntemperature can be measured accurately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Tycos multiple indicating pyrometer and\r\nrecorder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--Pyrometer in galvanizing tank.]\r\n\r\nDistance does not matter, as the brightness of the image formed\r\nby the lens is practically constant, regardless of the distance\r\nof the instrument from the hot object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Leeds & Northrup optical pyrometer.]\r\n\r\nThe manipulation is simple and rapid, consisting merely in the turning\r\nof a knurled knob. The setting is made with great precision, due to\r\nthe rapid change in light intensity with change in temperature and\r\nto the sensitiveness of the eye to differences of light intensity.\r\nIn the region of temperatures used for hardening steel, for example,\r\ndifferent observers using the instrument will agree within 3°C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--Too low.\r\n\r\nFIG. 125.--Too high.\r\n\r\nFIG. 126.--Correct.]\r\n\r\nOnly brightness, not color, of light is matched, as light of only\r\none color reaches the eye. Color blindness, therefore, is no hindrance\r\nto the use of this method. The use of the instrument is shown in\r\nFig. 127.\r\n\r\nOPTICAL SYSTEM AND ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT OF THE LEEDS & NORTHRUP OPTICAL\r\nPYROMETER.--For extremely high temperature, the optical pyrometer is\r\nlargely used. This is a comparative method. By means of the rheostat\r\nthe current through the lamp is adjusted until the brightness of\r\nthe filament is just equal to the brightness of the image produced\r\nby the lens _L_, Fig. 123, whereupon the filament blends with or\r\nbecomes indistinguishable in the background formed by the image\r\nof the hot object. This adjustment can be made with great accuracy\r\nand certainty, as the effect of radiation upon the eye varies some\r\ntwenty times faster than does the temperature at 1,600°F., and some\r\nfourteen times faster at 3,400°F. When a balance has been obtained,\r\nthe observer notes the reading of the milliammeter. The temperature\r\ncorresponding to the current is then read from a calibration curve\r\nsupplied with the instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--Using the optical pyrometer.]\r\n\r\nAs the intensity of the light emitted at the higher temperatures\r\nbecomes dazzling, it is found desirable to introduce a piece of red\r\nglass in the eye piece at _R_. This also eliminates any question\r\nof matching colors, or of the observer's ability to distinguish\r\ncolors. It is further of value in dealing with bodies which do\r\nnot radiate light of the same composition as that emitted by a\r\nblack body, since nevertheless the intensity of radiation of any\r\none color from such bodies increases progressively in a definite\r\nmanner as the temperature rises. The intensity of this one color\r\ncan therefore be used as a measure of temperature for the body\r\nin question. Figures 124 to 126 show the way it is read.\r\n\r\nCORRECTION FOR COLD-JUNCTION ERRORS\r\n\r\nThe voltage generated by a thermo-couple of an electric pyrometer is\r\ndependent on the difference in temperature between its hot junction,\r\ninside the furnace, and the cold junction, or opposite end of the\r\nthermo-couple to which the copper wires are connected. If the\r\ntemperature or this cold junction rises and falls, the indications\r\nof the instrument will vary, although the hot junction in the furnace\r\nmay be at a constant temperature.\r\n\r\nA cold-junction temperature of 75°F., or 25°C., is usually adopted\r\nin commercial pyrometers, and the pointer on the pyrometer should\r\nstand at this point on the scale when the hot junction is not heated.\r\nIf the cold-junction temperature rises about 75°F., where base metal\r\nthermo-couples are used, the pyrometer will read approximately 1°\r\nlow for every 1° rise in temperature above 75°F. For example, if the\r\ninstrument is adjusted for a cold-junction temperature of 75°, and\r\nthe actual cold-junction temperature is 90°F., the pyrometer will\r\nread 15° low. If, however, the cold-junction temperature falls below\r\n75°F., the pyrometer will read high instead of low, approximately\r\n1° for every 1° drop in temperature below 75°F.\r\n\r\nWith platinum thermo-couples, the error is approximately 1/2° for\r\n1° change in temperature.\r\n\r\nCORRECTION BY ZERO ADJUSTMENT.--Many pyrometers are supplied with\r\na zero adjuster, by means of which the pointer can be set to any\r\nactual cold-junction temperature. If the cold junction of the\r\nthermo-couple is in a temperature of 100°F., the pointer can be\r\nset to this point on the scale, and the readings of the instrument\r\nwill be correct.\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATING LEADS.--By the use of compensating leads, formed of\r\nthe same material as the thermo-couple, the cold junction can be\r\nremoved from the head of the thermo-couple to a point 10, 20 or 50\r\nft. distant from the furnace, where the temperature is reasonably\r\nconstant. Where greater accuracy is desired, a common method is\r\nto drive a 2-in. pipe, with a pointed closed end, some 10 to 20\r\nft. into the ground, as shown in Fig. 128. The compensating leads\r\nare joined to the copper leads, and the junction forced down to\r\nthe bottom of the pipe. The cold junction is now in the ground,\r\nbeneath the building, at a depth at which the temperature is very\r\nconstant, about 70°F., throughout the year. This method will usually\r\ncontrol the cold-junction temperature within 5°F.\r\n\r\nWhere the greatest accuracy is desired a compensating box will\r\novercome cold-junction errors entirely. It consists of a case enclosing\r\na lamp and thermostat, which can be adjusted to maintain any desired\r\ntemperature, from 50 to 150°F. The compensating leads enter the box\r\nand copper leads run from the compensating box to the instrument,\r\nso that the cold junction is within the box. Figure 129 shows a\r\nBrown compensating box.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Correcting cold-junction error.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to maintain the cold junction at 100°: the thermostat\r\nis set at this point, and the lamp, being wired to the 110- or\r\n220-volt lighting circuit, will light and heat the box until 100°\r\nis reached, when the thermostat will open the circuit and the light\r\nis extinguished. The box will now cool down to 98°, when the circuit\r\nis again closed, the lamp lights, the box heats up, and the operation\r\nis repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Compensating box.]\r\n\r\nBROWN AUTOMATIC SIGNALING PYROMETER\r\n\r\nIn large heat-treating plants it has been customary to maintain\r\nan operator at a central pyrometer, and by colored electric lights\r\nat the furnaces, signal whether the temperatures are correct or\r\nnot. It is common practice to locate three lights above each\r\nfurnace-red, white and green. The red light burns when the temperature\r\nis too low, the white light when the temperature is within certain\r\nlimits--for example, 20°F. of the correct temperature--and the\r\ngreen light when the temperature is too high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--Brown automatic signaling pyrometer.]\r\n\r\nInstruments to operate the lights automatically have been devised and\r\none made by Brown is shown in Fig. 130. The same form of instrument is\r\nused for this purpose to automatically control furnace temperatures,\r\nand the pointer is depressed at intervals of every 10 sec. on contacts\r\ncorresponding to the red, white and green lights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--Automatic temperature control.]\r\n\r\nAN AUTOMATIC TEMPERATURE CONTROL PYROMETER\r\n\r\nAutomatic temperature control instruments are similar to the Brown\r\nindicating high resistance pyrometer with the exception that the\r\npointer is depressed at intervals of every 10 sec. upon contact-making\r\ndevices. No current passes through the pointer which simply depresses\r\nthe upper contact device tipped with platinum, which in turn comes\r\nin contact with the lower contact device, platinum-tipped, and the\r\ncircuit is completed through these two contacts. The current is very\r\nsmall, about 1/10 amp., as it is only necessary to operate the relay\r\nwhich in turn operates the switch or valve. A small motor is used to\r\ndepress the pointer at regular intervals. The contact-making device\r\nis adjustable throughout the scale range of the instrument, and an\r\nindex pointer indicates the point on the instrument at which the\r\ntemperature is being controlled. The space between the two contacts\r\non the high and low side, separated by insulating material, is\r\nequivalent to 1 per cent of the scale range. A control of temperature\r\nis therefore possible within 1 per cent of the total scale range.\r\nFigure 131 shows this attached to a small furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--Portable thermocouple testing molten brass.]\r\n\r\nPYROMETERS FOR MOLTEN METAL\r\n\r\nPyrometers for molten metal are connected to portable thermocouples\r\nas in Fig. 132. Usually the pyrometer is portable, as shown in\r\nthis case, which is a Brown. Other methods of mounting for this\r\nkind of work arc shown in Figs. 133 and 134. The bent mountings\r\nare designed for molten metal, such as brass or copper and are\r\nsupplied with either clay, graphite or carborundum tubes. Fifteen\r\nfeet of connecting wire is usually supplied.\r\n\r\nThe angle mountings, Fig. 134, are recommended for baths such as\r\nlead or cyanide. The horizontal arm is usually about 14 in. long,\r\nand the whole mounting is easily taken apart making replacements\r\nvery easy. Details of the thermo-couple shown in Fig. 132 are given\r\nin Fig. 135. This is a straight rod with a protector for the hand\r\nof the operator. The lag in such couples is less than one minute.\r\nThese are Englehard mountings.\r\n\r\nPROTECTORS FOR THERMO-COUPLES\r\n\r\nThermo-couples must be protected from the danger of mechanical\r\ninjury. For this purpose tubes of various refractory materials\r\nare made to act as protectors. These in turn are usually protected\r\nby outside metal tubes. Pure wrought iron is largely used for this\r\npurpose as it scales and oxidizes very slowly. These tubes are\r\nusually made from 2 to 4 in. shorter than the inner tubes. In lead\r\nbaths the iron tubes often have one end welded closed and are used\r\nin connection with an angle form of mounting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--Bent handle thermocouple with protector.]\r\n\r\nWhere it is necessary for protecting tubes to project a considerable\r\ndistance into the furnace a tube made of nichrome is frequently used.\r\nThis is a comparatively new alloy which stands high temperatures\r\nwithout bending. It is more costly than iron but also much more\r\ndurable.\r\n\r\nWhen used in portable work and for high temperatures, pure nickel\r\ntubes are sometimes used. There is also a special metal tube made\r\nfor use in cyanide. This metal withstands the intense penetrating\r\ncharacteristics of cyanide. It lasts from six to ten months as\r\nagainst a few days for the iron tube.\r\n\r\nThe inner tubes of refractory materials, also vary according to\r\nthe purposes for which they are to be used. They are as follows:\r\n\r\nMARQUARDT MASS TUBES for temperatures up to 3,000°F., but they will\r\nnot stand sudden changes in temperature, such as in contact with\r\nintermittent flames, without an extra outer covering of chamotte,\r\nfireclay or carborundum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--Other styles of bent mounting.]\r\n\r\nFUSED SILICA TUBES for continuous temperatures up to 1,800°F. and\r\nintermittently up to 2,400°F. The expansion at various temperatures\r\nis very small, which makes them of value for portable work. They\r\nalso resist most acids.\r\n\r\nCHAMOTTE TUBES are useful up to 2,800°F. and are mechanically strong.\r\nThey have a small expansion and resist temperature changes well,\r\nwhich makes them good as outside protectors for more fragile tubes.\r\nThey cannot be used in molten metals, or baths of any kind nor\r\nin gases of an alkaline nature. They are used mainly to protect\r\na Marquardt mass or silica tube.\r\n\r\nCARBORUNDUM TUBES are also used as outside protection to other\r\ntubes. They stand sudden changes of temperature well and resist\r\nall gases except chlorine, above 1,750°F. Especially useful in\r\nprotecting other tubes against molten aluminum, brass, copper and\r\nsimilar metals.\r\n\r\nCLAY TUBES are sometimes used in large annealing furnaces where they\r\nare cemented into place, forming a sort of well for the insertion of\r\nthe thermo-couple. They are also used with portable thermo-couples\r\nfor obtaining the temperatures of molten iron and steel in ladles.\r\nUsed in this way they are naturally short-lived, but seem the best\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--Straight thermocouple and guard.]\r\n\r\nCORUNDITE TUBES are used as an outer protection for both the Marquardt\r\nmass and the silica tubes for kilns and for glass furnaces. Graphite\r\ntubes are also used in some cases for outer protections.\r\n\r\nCALORIZED TUBES are wrought-iron pipe treated with aluminum vapor\r\nwhich often doubles or even triples the life of the tube at high\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThese tubes come in different sizes and lengths depending on the\r\nuses for which they are intended. Heavy protecting outer tubes\r\nmay be only 1 in. in inside diameter and as much as 3 in. outside\r\ndiameter, while the inner tubes, such as the Marquardt mass and\r\nsilica tubes are usually about 3/4 in. outside and 3/8 in. inside\r\ndiameter. The length varies from 12 to 48 in. in most cases.\r\n\r\nSpecial terminal heads are provided, with brass binding posts for\r\nelectrical connections, and with provisions for water cooling when\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTABLE 32.--Temperature Conversion Tables.\r\n\r\nTABLE 33.--Comparison Between Degrees Centigrade and Degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nTABLE 34.--Weight of Round, Octagon and Square Carbon Tool Steel\r\nper Foot.\r\n\r\nTABLE 35.--Weight of Round Carbon Tool Steel 12 In. in Diameter\r\nand Larger, per Foot.\r\n\r\nTABLE 36.--Decimal Equivalents of a foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE CONVERSION TABLES\r\n\r\nBy ALBERT SAUVEUR\r\n\r\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    -459.4 to 0   |             0 to 100         |       100 to 1000\r\n -----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------\r\n   C.
