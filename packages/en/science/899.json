Marion\r\n\r\n1870\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n“Let posterity know, and knowing be astonished, that on the fifteenth\r\nday of September, 1784, Vincent Lunardi of Lucca, in Tuscany, the first\r\naerial traveller in Britain, mounting from the Artillery Ground in\r\nLondon, and traversing the regions of the air for two hours and fifteen\r\nminutes, on this spot revisited the earth. In this rude monument for\r\nages be recorded this wondrous enterprise successfully achieved by\r\nthe powers of chemistry and the fortitude of man, this improvement in\r\nscience which the great Author of all Knowledge, patronising by his\r\nProvidence the inventions of mankind, hath graciously permitted, to\r\ntheir benefit and his own eternal glory.”\r\n\r\nThe stone upon which the above inscription was carved, stands, or stood\r\nrecently, near Collier’s End, in the parish of Standon, Hertfordshire;\r\nand it will possibly afford the English reader a more accurate idea of\r\nthe feelings with which the world hailed the discovery of the balloon\r\nthan any incident or illustration drawn from the annals of a foreign\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe work which we now introduce to our readers does not exaggerate the\r\ncase when it declares that no discovery of modern times has aroused so\r\nlarge an amount of enthusiasm, has excited so many hopes, has appeared\r\nto the human race to open up so many vistas of enterprise and research,\r\nas that for which we are mainly indebted to the Brothers Montgolfier.\r\nThe discovery or the invention of the balloon, however, was one of those\r\nefforts of genius and enterprise which have no infancy. It had reached\r\nits full growth when it burst upon the world, and the ninety years which\r\nhave since elapsed have witnessed no development of the original idea.\r\nThe balloon of to-day--the balloon in which Coxwell and Glaisher have\r\nmade their perilous trips into the remote regions of the air--is in\r\nalmost every respect the same as the balloon with which “the physician\r\nCharles,” following in the footsteps of the Montgolfiers, astonished\r\nParis in 1783. There are few more tantalising stories in the annals of\r\ninvention than this. So much had been accomplished when Roziers made his\r\nfirst aerial voyage above the astonished capital of France that all the\r\nrest seemed easy. The new highway appeared to have been thrown open\r\nto the world, and the dullest imagination saw the air thronged with\r\ncolossal chariots, bearing travellers in perfect safety, and with more\r\nthan the speed of the eagle, from city to city, from country to\r\ncountry, reckless of all the obstacles--the seas, and rivers, and\r\nmountains--which Nature might have placed in the path of the wayfarer.\r\nBut from that moment to the present the prospect which was thus opened\r\nup has remained a vision and nothing more. There are--as those who\r\nvisited the Crystal Palace two years ago have reason to know--not a few\r\nmen who still believe in the practicability of journeying by air. But,\r\nwith hardly an exception, those few have abandoned all idea of utilising\r\nthe balloon for this purpose. The graceful “machine” which astonished\r\nthe world at its birth remains to this day as beautiful, and as useless\r\nfor the purposes of travel, as in the first hour of its history. The day\r\nmay come when some one more fortunate than the Montgolfiers may earn the\r\nDuke of Sutherland’s offered reward by a successful flight from the Mall\r\nto the top of Stafford House; but when this comes to pass the balloon\r\nwill have no share in the honour of the achievement. Not the less,\r\nhowever, is the story of this wonderful invention worthy of being\r\nrecorded. It deserves a place in the history of human enterprise--if\r\nfor nothing else--because of the daring courage which it has in so\r\nmany cases brought to light. From the days of Roziers down to those of\r\nCoxwell, our aeronauts have fearlessly tempted dangers not less terrible\r\nthan those which face the soldier as he enters the imminent deadly\r\nbreach; and, as one of the chapters in this volume mournfully proves,\r\nnot a few of their number have paid the penalty of their rash courage\r\nwith their lives. All the more is it to be regretted that so little\r\npractical good has resulted from their labours and their sacrifices; and\r\nthat so many of those who have perished in balloon voyages have done\r\nso whilst serving to better end than the amusement of a holiday crowd.\r\nThere is, however, another aspect which makes at least the earlier\r\nhistory of the balloon well worth preserving. This is the influence\r\nwhich the invention had upon the generation which witnessed it. As\r\nthese pages show, the people of Europe seem to have been absolutely\r\nintoxicated by the success of the Montgolfiers’ discovery. There is\r\nsomething bitterly suggestive in our knowledge of this fact. Whilst\r\npensions and honours and popular applause were being showered upon\r\nthe inventors of the balloon, Watt was labouring unnoticed at his\r\nimprovements of the steam-engine--a very prosaic affair compared with\r\nthe gilded globe which Montgolfier had caused to rise from earth amidst\r\nthe acclamations of a hundred thousand spectators, but one which had\r\nbefore it a somewhat different history to that of the more startling\r\ninvention. England, when it remembers the story of the steam-engine,\r\nhas little need to grudge France the honour of discovering the balloon.\r\nAfter all, however, Great Britain had its share in that discovery. The\r\nearly observations of Francis Bacon and Bishop Wilkins paved the way for\r\nthe later achievement, whilst it was our own Cavendish who discovered\r\nthat hydrogen gas was lighter than air; and Dr. Black of Edinburgh, who\r\nfirst employed that gas to raise a globe in which it was contained from\r\nthe earth. The Scotch professor, we are told, thought that the discovery\r\nwhich he made when he sent his little tissue-paper balloon from his\r\nlecture-table to the ceiling of his classroom, was of no use except as\r\naffording the means of making an interesting experiment. Possibly our\r\nreaders, after they have perused this volume, may think that Dr Black\r\nwas not after all so far wrong as people once imagined. Be this as it\r\nmay, however, in these pages is the history of the balloon, and of\r\nthe most memorable balloon voyages, and we comprehend the story to our\r\nreaders not the less cordially that it comes from the land where the\r\nballoon had its birth.\r\n\r\nLondon, January, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALLOONS AND AIR JOURNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I. THE CONQUEST OF THE SKIES.--1783.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. Introduction.\r\n\r\nThe title of our introduction to aeronautics may appear ambitious to\r\nastronomers, and to those who know that the infinite space we call the\r\nheavens is for ever inaccessible to travellers from the earth; but\r\nit was not so considered by those who witnessed the ardent enthusiasm\r\nevoked at the ascension of the first balloon. No discovery, in the\r\nwhole range of history, has elicited an equal degree of applause and\r\nadmiration--never has the genius of man won a triumph which at first\r\nblush seemed more glorious. The mathematical and physical sciences\r\nhad in aeronautics achieved apparently their greatest honours, and\r\ninaugurated a new era in the progress of knowledge. After having\r\nsubjected the earth to their power; after having made the waves of the\r\nsea stoop in submission under the keels of their ships; after having\r\ncaught the lightning of heaven and made it subservient to the ordinary\r\npurposes of life, the genius of man undertook to conquer the regions of\r\nthe air. Imagination, intoxicated with past successes, could descry no\r\nlimit to human power; the gates of the infinite seemed to be swinging\r\nback before man’s advancing step, and the last was believed to be the\r\ngreatest of his achievements.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the frenzy of the enthusiasm which the first\r\naeronautic triumphs called forth, it is necessary to recall the\r\nappearance of Montgolfier at Versailles, on the 19th of September, 1783,\r\nbefore Louis XVI, or of the earliest aeronauts at the Tuileries. Paris\r\nhailed the first of these men with the greatest acclaim, “and then, as\r\nnow,” says a French writer, “the voice of Paris gave the cue to France,\r\nand France to the world!” Nobles and artisans, scientific men and\r\nbadauds, great and small, were moved with one universal impulse. In the\r\nstreets the praises of the balloon were sung; in the libraries models\r\nof it abounded; and in the salons the one universal topic was the great\r\n“machine.” In anticipation, the poet delighted himself with bird’s-eye\r\nviews of the scenery of strange countries; the prisoner mused on what\r\nmight be a new way of escape; the physicist visited the laboratory in\r\nwhich the lightning and the meteors were manufactured; the geometrician\r\nbeheld the plans of cities and the outlines of kingdoms; the general\r\ndiscovered the position of the enemy or rained shells on the besieged\r\ntown; the police beheld a new mode in which to carry on the secret\r\nservice; Hope heralded a new conquest from the domain of nature, and the\r\nhistorian registered a new chapter in the annals of human knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Scientific discoveries in general,” says Arago, “even those from\r\nwhich men expect the most advantage, like those of the compass and the\r\nsteam-engine, were greeted at first with contempt, or at the best with\r\nindifference. Political events, and the fortunes of armies monopolised\r\nalmost entirely the attention of the people. But to this rule there\r\nare two exceptions--the discoveries of America and of aerostatics, the\r\nadvents of Columbus and of Montgolfier.” It is not here our duty\r\nto inquire how it happened that the discoveries made by these two\r\npersonages are classed together. Air-travelling may be as unproductive\r\nof actual good to society as filling the belly with the “east wind” is\r\nto the body, while every one knows something of the extent to which the\r\ndiscovery of Columbus has influenced the character, the civilisation,\r\nthe destinies, in short, of the human race. We are speaking at present\r\nof the known and well-attested fact, that the discovery of America\r\nand the discovery of the method of traversing space by means of\r\nballoons--however they may differ in respect of results to man--rank\r\nequally in this, that of all other discoveries these two have attracted\r\nthe greatest amount of attention, and given, in their respective eras,\r\nthe greatest impulse to popular feeling. Let the reader recall the marks\r\nof enthusiasm which the discovery of the islands on the east coast of\r\nAmerica excited in Andalusia, in Catalonia, in Aragon and Castile--let\r\nhim read the narrative of the honours paid by town and village, not only\r\nto the hero of the enterprise, but even to his commonest sailors, and\r\nthen let him search the records of the epoch for the degree of sensation\r\nproduced by the discovery of aeronautics in France, which stands in the\r\nsame relationship to this event as that in which Spain stands to the\r\nother. The processions of Seville and Barcelona are the exact prototypes\r\nof the fetes of Lyons and Paris. In France, in 1783, as in Spain two\r\ncenturies previously, the popular imagination was so greatly excited by\r\nthe deeds performed, that it began to believe in possibilities of\r\nthe most unlikely description. In Spain, the conquestadores and their\r\nfollowers believed that in a few days after they had landed on American\r\nsoil, they would have gathered as much gold and precious stones, as were\r\nthen possessed by the richest European Sovereigns. In France, each one\r\nfollowing his own notions, made out for himself special benefits to flow\r\nfrom the discovery of balloons. Every discovery then appeared to be only\r\nthe precursor of other and greater discoveries, and nothing after that\r\ntime seemed to be impossible to him who attempted the conquest of the\r\natmosphere. This idea clothed itself in every form. The young embraced\r\nit with enthusiasm, the old made it the subject of endless regrets. When\r\none of the first aeronautic ascents was made, the old Marechal Villeroi,\r\nan octogenarian and an invalid, was conducted to one of the windows of\r\nthe Tuileries, almost by force, for he did not believe in balloons. The\r\nballoon, meanwhile, detached itself from its moorings; the physician\r\nCharles, seated in the car, gaily saluted the public, and was then\r\nmajestically launched into space in his air-boat; and at once the old\r\nMarechal, beholding this, passed suddenly from unbelief to perfect faith\r\nin aerostatics and in the capacity of the human mind, fell on his knees,\r\nand, with his eyes bathed in tears, moaned out pitifully the words,\r\n“Yes, it is fixed! It is certain! They will find out the secret of\r\navoiding death; but it will be after I am gone!”\r\n\r\nIf we recall the impressions which the first air-journeys made, we shall\r\nfind that, among people of enthusiastic temperament, it was believed\r\nthat it was not merely the blue sky above us, not merely the terrestrial\r\natmosphere, but the vast spaces through which the worlds move, that\r\nwere to become the domain of man--the sea of the balloon. The moon,\r\nthe mysterious dwelling-place of men unknown, would no longer be an\r\ninaccessible place. Space no longer contained regions which man could\r\nnot cross! Indeed, certain expeditions attempted the crossing of the\r\nheavens, and brought back news of the moon. The planets that revolve\r\nround the sun, the far-flying comets, the most distant stars--these\r\nformed the field which from that time was to lie open to the\r\ninvestigations of man.\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm one can well enough understand. There is in the simple\r\nfact of an aerial ascent something so bold and so astonishing, that the\r\nhuman spirit cannot fail to be profoundly stirred by it. And if this is\r\nthe feeling of men at the present day, when, after having been witnesses\r\nof ascents for the last eighty years, they see men confiding themselves\r\nin a swinging car into the immensities of space, what must have been the\r\nastonishment of those who, for the first time since the commencement\r\nof the world, beheld one of their fellow-creatures rolling in space,\r\nwithout any other assurance of safety than what his still dim perception\r\nof the laws of nature gave him?\r\n\r\nWhy should we be obliged here to state that the great discovery that\r\nstirred the spirits of men from the one end of Europe to the other,\r\nand gave rise to hopes of such vast discoveries, should have failed\r\nin realising the expectations which seemed so clearly justified by the\r\nfirst experiments? It is now eighty-six years since the first aerial\r\njourney astonished the world, and yet, in 1870, we are but little\r\nmore advanced in the science than we were in 1783. Our age is the most\r\nrenowned for its discoveries of any that the world has seen. Man is\r\nborne over the surface of the earth by steam; he is as familiar as the\r\nfish with the liquid element; he transmits his words instantaneously\r\nfrom London to New York; he draws pictures without pencil or brush, and\r\nhas made the sun his slave. The air alone remains to him unsubdued. The\r\nproper management of balloons has not yet been discovered. More\r\nthan that, it appears that balloons are unmanageable, and it is to\r\nair-vessels, constructed more nearly upon the model of birds, that we\r\nmust go to find out the secret of aerial navigation. At present, as in\r\nformer times, we are at the mercy of balloons--globes lighter than the\r\nair, and therefore the sport and the prey of tempests and currents.\r\nAnd aeronauts, instead of showing themselves now as the benefactors of\r\nmankind, exhibit themselves mainly to gratify a frivolous curiosity, or\r\nto crown with eclat a public fete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. Attempts in Ancient Times to Fly in the Air.\r\n\r\nBefore contemplating the sudden conquest of the aerial kingdom, as\r\naccomplished and proclaimed at the end of the last century, it is at\r\nonce curious and instructive to cast a glance backward, and to examine,\r\nby the glimmering of ancient traditions, the attempts which have been\r\nmade or imagined by man to enfranchise himself from the attraction of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n“The greater number of the arts and sciences can be traced along a\r\nchronological ladder of great length: some, indeed, lose themselves in\r\nthe night of time.” The accomplishment of raising oneself in the air,\r\nhowever, had no actual professors in antiquity, and the discovery\r\nof Montgolfier seems to have come into the world, so to speak,\r\nspontaneously. By this it is to be understood that, unlike Copernicus\r\nand Columbus, Montgolfier could not read in history of any similar\r\ndiscovery, containing the germ of his own feat. At least, we have no\r\nproof that the ancient nations practiced the art of aerial navigation\r\nto any extent whatever. The attempts which we are about to cite do not\r\nstrictly belong to the history of aerostatics.\r\n\r\nClassic mythology tells us of Daedalus, who, escaping with his son\r\nIcarus from the anger of Minos, in the Isle of Crete, saved himself from\r\nthe immediate evil by the aid of wings, which he made for himself and\r\nhis son, and by means of which they were enabled to fly in the air. The\r\nwings, it appears, were soldered with wax, and Icarus, flying too high,\r\nwas struck by a ray of the sun, which melted the wax. The youth fell\r\ninto the sea, which from him derived its name of Icarian. It is possible\r\nthat this fable only symbolisms the introduction of sails in navigation.\r\n\r\nComing down through ancient history, we note a certain Archytas, of\r\nTarentum, who, in the fourth century B. C., is said to have launched\r\ninto the air the first “flying stag,” and who, according to the Greek\r\nwriters, “made a pigeon of wood, which flew, but which could not\r\nraise itself again after having fallen.” Its flight, it is said, “was\r\naccomplished by means of a mechanical contrivance, by the vibrations of\r\nwhich it was sustained in the air.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 66 A.D., in the time of Nero, Simon, the magician--who\r\ncalled himself “the mechanician”--made certain experiments at Rome of\r\nflying at a certain height. In the eyes of the early Christians this\r\npower was attributed to the devil, and St. Peter, the namesake of this\r\nflying man, is said to have prayed fervently while Simon was amusing\r\nhimself in space. It was possibly in answer to his prayers that the\r\nmagician failed in his flight, fell upon the Forum, and broke his neck\r\non the spot.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the tower of the hippodrome at Constantinople, a\r\ncertain Saracen met the same fate as Simon, in the reign of the Emperor\r\nComnenus. His experiments were conducted on the principle of the\r\ninclined plane. He descended in an oblique course, using the resistance\r\nof the air as a support. His robe, very long and very large, and of\r\nwhich the flaps were extended on an osier frame, preserved him from\r\nsuddenly falling.\r\n\r\nThe inclined plane probably suggested to Milton the flight of the angel\r\nUriel, in “Paradise Lost,” who descended in the morning from heaven to\r\nearth upon a ray of the sun, and ascended in the evening from earth to\r\nheaven by the same means. But we cannot quote here the fancies of\r\npure imagination, and we will not speak of Medeus the magician, of the\r\nenchantress Armida, of the witches of the Brocken, of the hippogriff\r\nof Zephyrus with the rosy wings, or of the diabolical inventions of the\r\nmiddle ages, for many of which the stake was the only reward.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon, in the thirteenth century, inaugurated a more scientific\r\nera. In his “Treaty of the Admirable Power of Art and Nature,” he puts\r\nforth the idea that it is possible “to make flying-machines in which the\r\nman, being seated or suspended in the middle, might turn some winch or\r\ncrank, which would put in motion a suit of wings made to strike the\r\nair like those of a bird.” In the same treatise he sketches a\r\nflying-machine, to which that of Blanchard, who lived in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, bears a certain resemblance. The monk, Roger Bacon, was worthy\r\nof entering the temple of fame before his great namesake the Lord\r\nChancellor, who in the seventeenth century inaugurated the era of\r\nexperimental science.\r\n\r\nJean Baptiste Dante, a mathematician of Perugia, who lived in the latter\r\npart of the fifteenth century, constructed artificial wings, by means of\r\nwhich, when applied to thin bodies, men might raise themselves off\r\nthe ground into the air. It is recorded that on many occasions he\r\nexperimented with his wings on the Lake Thrasymenus. These experiments,\r\nhowever, had a sad end. At a fete, given for the celebration of the\r\nmarriage of Bartholomew d’Alvani, Dante, who must not be confounded with\r\nthe poet, whose flights were of quite another kind--offered to exhibit\r\nthe wonder of his wings to the people of Perugia. He managed to raise\r\nhimself to a great height, and flew above the square; but the iron\r\nwith which he moved one of his wings having been bent, he fell upon the\r\nchurch of the Virgin, and broke his thigh.\r\n\r\nA similar accident befell a learned English Benedictine Oliver of\r\nMalmesbury. This ecclesiastic was considered gifted with the power of\r\nforetelling events; but, like other similarly circumstanced, he does\r\nnot seem to have beer able to divine the fate which awaited himself.\r\nHe constructed wings after the model of those which according to Ovid,\r\nDaedalus made use of. These he attached to his arms and his feet, and,\r\nthus furnished, he threw himself from the height of a tower. But the\r\nwings bore him up for little more than a distance of 120 paces. He fell\r\nat the foot of the tower, broke his legs, and from that moment led a\r\nlanguishing life. He consoled himself, however, in his misfortune\r\nby saying that his attempt must certainly have succeeded had he only\r\nprovided himself with a tail.\r\n\r\nBefore going further, let us take notice that the seventeenth century\r\nis, par excellence, the century distinguished for narratives of\r\nimaginary travels. It was then that astronomy opened up its world of\r\nmarvels. The knowledge of observers was vastly increased, and from that\r\ntime it became possible to distinguish the surface of the moon and of\r\nother celestial bodies. Thus a new world, as it were, was revealed for\r\nhuman thought and speculation. We learned that our globe was not, as we\r\nhad supposed, the centre of the universe. It was assigned its place far\r\nfrom that centre, and was known to be no more than a mere atom, lost\r\namid an incalculable number of other globes. The revelations of the\r\ntelescope proved that those who formerly were considered wise actually\r\nknew nothing. Quickly following these discoveries, extraordinary\r\nnarratives of excursions through space began to be given to the world.\r\n\r\nThose scientific romances were simply wild exaggerations, based upon the\r\nthinnest foundation of scientific facts. In order, however, to describe\r\na journey among the stars, it was necessary to invent some mode of\r\nlocomotion in these distant regions. In former times Lucian had been\r\ncontent with a ship which ascended to the rising moon upon a waterspout;\r\nbut it was now necessary to improve upon this very primitive mode, as\r\npeople began to know something more of the forces of nature. One of the\r\nfirst of these travellers in imagination to the moon in modern times was\r\nGodwin (1638), and his plan was more ingenious than that of Lucian. He\r\ntrained a great number of the wild swans of St. Helena to fly constantly\r\nupward toward a white object, and, having succeeded in thus training\r\nthem, one fine night he threw himself off the Peak of Teneriffe, poised\r\nupon a piece of board, which was borne upward to the white moon by a\r\ngreat team of the gigantic swans. At the end of twelve days he arrived,\r\naccording to his story, at his destination. A little later another\r\nwriter of this peculiar kind of fiction, Wilkins, an Englishman,\r\nprofessed to have made the same ascent, borne up by an eagle. Alexandre\r\nDumas, who recently wrote a short romance upon the same subject, only\r\nmade a translation of an English work by that author. Wilkins’ work is\r\nentitled, “The Discovery of a New World.” One chapter of the book bears\r\nthe title, “That ‘tis possible for some of our posterity to find out a\r\nconveyance to this other world; and, if there be inhabitants there, to\r\nhave commerce with them.” It is thus that the right reverend philosopher\r\nreasons:--\r\n\r\n“If it be here inquired what means there may be conjectured for our\r\nascending beyond the sphere of the earth’s mathematical vigour, I\r\nanswer.--1. ‘Tis not possible that a man may be able to fly by the\r\napplication of wings to his own body, as angels are pictured, as\r\nMercury and Daedalus are feigned, and as hath been attempted by divers,\r\nparticularly by a Turk in Constantinople, a Busbequius relates. 2. If\r\nthere be such a great duck in Madagascar as Marcus Polus, the Venetian,\r\nmentions, the feathers of whose wings are twelve feet long, which can\r\nscoop up a horse and his rider, or an elephant, as our kites do a mouse;\r\nwhy, then, ‘Tis but teaching one of these to carry a man, and he may\r\nride up thither, as Ganymede does upon an eagle. 3. Or if neither of\r\nthese ways will serve yet I do seriously, and upon good grounds, affirm\r\nit is possible to make a flying chariot, in which a man may sit and\r\ngive such a motion to it as shall convey him through the air. And this,\r\nperhaps, might be made large enough to carry divers men at the same\r\ntime, together with food for their viaticum, and commodities for\r\ntraffic. It is not the bigness of anything in this kind that can hinder\r\nits motion if the motive faculty be answerable “hereunto. We see that;\r\ngreat ship swims as well as a small cork, and an eagle flies in the air\r\nas well as a little gnat. This engine may be contrived from the same\r\nprinciples by which Archytas made a wooden dove, and Regiomontanus\r\na wooden eagle. I conceive it were no difficult matter (if a man had\r\nleisure) to show more particularly the means of composing it. The\r\nperfecting of such an invention would be of such excellent use that it\r\nwere enough, not only to make a man famous but the age wherein he lives.\r\nFor, besides the strange discoveries that it might occasion in this\r\nother world, it would be also of inconceivable advantage for travelling,\r\nabove any other conveyance that is now in use. So that, notwithstanding\r\nall these seeming impossibilities, it is likely enough that there may be\r\na means invented of journeying to the moon; and how happy shall they be\r\nthat are first successful in this attempt!”\r\n\r\nAfterwards comes Cyrano of Bergerac, who promulgates five different\r\nmeans of flying in the air. First, by means of phials filled with dew,\r\nwhich would attract and cause to mount up. Secondly, by a great bird\r\nmade of wood, the wings of which should be kept in motion. Thirdly, by\r\nrockets, which, going off successively, would drive up the balloon by\r\nthe force of projection. Fourthly, by an octahedron of glass, heated by\r\nthe sun, and of which the lower part should be allowed to penetrate the\r\ndense cold air, which, pressing up against the rarefied hot air, would\r\nraise the balloon. Fifthly, by a car of iron and a ball of magnetised\r\niron, which the aeronaut would keep throwing up in the air, and which\r\nwould attract and draw up the balloon. The wiseacre who invented these\r\nmodes of flying in the air seems, some would say, to have been more in\r\nwant of very strict confinement on the earth than of the freedom of the\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nIn 1670 Francis Lana constructed the flying-machine shown on the next\r\npage. The specific lightness of heated air and of hydrogen gas not\r\nhaving yet been discovered, his only idea for making his globes rise was\r\nto take all the air out of them. But even supposing that the globes were\r\nthus rendered light enough to rise, they must inevitably have collapsed\r\nunder the atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nAs for the idea of making use of a sail to direct the balloon, as one\r\ndirects a vessel, that also was a delusion; for the whole machine,\r\nglobes and sails, being freely thrown into the air, would infallibly\r\nfollow the direction of the wind, whatever that might be. When a ship\r\nlies in the sea, and its sails are inflated with the wind, we must\r\nremember that there are two forces in operation--the active force of\r\nthe wind and the passive force of the resistance of the water; and in\r\nworking these forces the one against the other, the sailor can turn\r\nwithin a point of any direction he pleases. But when we are subjected\r\nwholly to a single force, and have no point of support by the use of\r\nwhich to turn that force to our own purposes, as is the case with the\r\naeronaut, we are entirely at the mercy of that force, and must obey it.\r\n\r\nAfter the flying-machine of Lana there was constructed by Galien (who,\r\nlike the former, was an ecclesiastic) an air-boat, less chimerical in\r\nits form, looked at in view of the conditions of aerial navigation,\r\nbut much more singular. Galien describes his air-boat, in 1755, in his\r\nlittle work entitled, “The Art of Sailing in the Air.” His project was\r\na most extraordinary one, and its boldness is only equalled by the\r\nseriousness of the narrative. According to him, the atmosphere is\r\ndivided into two horizontal layers, the upper of which is much lighter\r\nthan the lower. “But,” says Galien, “a ship keeps its place in the water\r\nbecause it is full of air, and air is much lighter than water. Suppose,\r\nthen, that there was the same difference of weight between the upper and\r\nthe lower layer of air as there is between the lower stratum and water;\r\nand suppose, also, a boat which rested upon the lower layer of air, with\r\nits bulk in the lighter upper layer--like a ship which has its keel in\r\nthe water but its bulk in the air--the same thing would happen with the\r\nair-ship as with the water-ship--it would float in the denser layer of\r\nair.”\r\n\r\nGalien adds that in the region of hail there was in the air a separation\r\ninto two layers, the weights of which respectively are as 1 to 2.\r\n“Then,” says he, “in placing an air-boat in the region of hail, with its\r\nsides rising eighty-three fathoms into the upper region, which is much\r\nmore light, one could sail perfectly.”\r\n\r\nBut how to get this enormous air-boat up to the region of hail? This is\r\na minor detail, respecting which Galien is not clear.\r\n\r\nFrom the labours of Lana and Galien, with their impossible flying\r\nmachines, the inventor of the balloon could derive no benefit whatever;\r\nnor is his fame to be in the least diminished because many had laboured\r\nin the same field before him. Nor can the story of the ovoador,\r\nor flying man, a legend very confused, and of which there are many\r\nversions, have given to Montgolfier any valuable hints. It appears that\r\na certain Laurent de Guzman, a monk of Rio Janeiro, performed at Lisbon\r\nbefore the king, John V., raising himself in a balloon to a considerable\r\nheight. Other versions of the story give a different date, and assign\r\nthe pretended ascent to 1709. The above engraving, extracted from the\r\n“Bibliotheque de la Rue de Richelieu,” is an exact copy of Guzman’s\r\nsupposed balloon.\r\n\r\nIn 1678 a mechanician of Salle, in Maine, named Besnier invented a\r\nflying-machine. The machine consisted of four great wings, or paddles,\r\nmounted at the extremities of levers, which rested on the shoulders of\r\nthe man who guided it, and who could move them alternately by means of\r\nhis hands and feet. The following description of the machine is given in\r\nthe Journal de Paris by an eye-witness:\r\n\r\n“The ‘wings’ are oblong frames, covered with taffeta, and attached to\r\nthe ends of two rods, adjusted on the shoulders The wings work up and\r\ndown. Those in front are worked by the hands; those behind by the feet,\r\nwhich are connected with the ends of the rods by strings. The movements\r\nwere such that when the right hand made the right wing descend in front,\r\nthe left foot made the left wing descend behind; and in like manner\r\nthe left hand in front and the right foot behind acted together\r\nsimultaneously. This diagonal action appeared very well contrived; it\r\nwas the action of most quadrupeds as well as of man when walking; but\r\nthe contrivance, like others of the same kind, failed in not being\r\nfitted with gearing to enable the air traveller to proceed in any other\r\ndirection than that in which the wind blew him. The inventor first flew\r\ndown from a stool, then from a table, afterwards from a window, and\r\nfinally from a garret, from which he passed above the houses in the\r\nneighbourhood, and then, moderating the working of his machine, he\r\ndescended slowly to the earth.”\r\n\r\nTradition records that under Louis XIV. a certain rope-dancer, named\r\nAlard, announced that on a certain day he would perform the feat of\r\nflying in the air. We have no description of his wings. It is recorded,\r\nhowever, that he set out on his adventurous flight; but he had not\r\ncalculated all the necessities of the case, and, falling to the ground,\r\nhe was dangerously hurt.\r\n\r\nLeonardo da Vinci might have known the art of flying in the air, and\r\nmight even have practiced it. A statement to this effect, at least, is\r\nfound in several historians. We have, however, no direct proof of the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe Deforges, of Etampes, announced in the journals in 1772 that\r\nhe would perform the great feat. On the appointed day multitudes of the\r\ncurious flocked to Etampes. The abbe’s machine was a sort of gondola,\r\nseven feet long and about two feet deep. Gondola conductor, and baggage\r\nweighed in all 213 pounds. The pious man believed that he had provided\r\nagainst everything. Neither tempest nor rain should mar his flight,\r\nand there was no chance of his being upset; whilst the machine, he had\r\ndecided, was to go at the rate of thirty leagues an hour.\r\n\r\nThe great day came, and the abbe, entering his air-boat amidst the\r\napplause of the spectators, began to work the wings with which it was\r\nprovided with great rapidity. “But,” says one who witnessed the feat,\r\n“the more he worked, the more his machine cleaved to the earth, as if it\r\nwere part and parcel of it.”\r\n\r\nRetif de la Bretonne, in his work upon this subject, gives the\r\naccompanying picture of a flying man, furnished with very artistically\r\ndesigned wings, fitting exactly to the shoulders, and carrying a basket\r\nof provisions, suspended from his waist; and the frontispiece of the\r\n“Philosophic sans Pretention” is a view of a flying-machine. In the\r\nmidst of a frame of light wood sits the operator, steadying himself with\r\none hand, and with the other fuming a cremaillere, which appears to\r\ngive a very quick rotatory movement to two glass globes revolving upon\r\na vertical axis. The friction of the globes is supposed to develop\r\nelectricity to which his power of ascending is ascribed.\r\n\r\nTo wings, however, aerial adventurers mostly adhered. The Marquis de\r\nRacqueville flew from a window of his hotel, on the banks of the\r\nSeine, and fell into a boat full of washerwomen on the river. All\r\nthese unfortunate attempts were lampooned, burlesqued on the stage, and\r\npursued with the mockery of the public.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, therefore, the efforts of man to conquer the air had\r\nmiscarried. They were conducted on a wrong principle, the machinery\r\nemployed being heavier than the air itself But, even before the time\r\nof Montgolfier, the principles of aerostation began to be recognised,\r\nthough nothing was actually done in the way of acting upon them. Thus,\r\nin 1767, Professor Black, of Edinburgh, announced in his class that a\r\nvessel, filled with hydrogen, would rise naturally in the air; but\r\nhe never made the experiment, regarding the fact as capable of being\r\nemployed only for amusement. Finally, Cavallo, in 1782, communicated\r\nto the Royal Society of London the experiments he had made, and which\r\nconsisted in filling soap-bubbles with hydrogen. The bubbles rose in the\r\natmosphere, the gas which filled them being lighter than air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The Theory of Balloons.\r\n\r\nA certain proposition in physics, known as the “Principle of\r\nArchimedes,” runs to the following effect:--“Every body plunged into a\r\nliquid loses a portion of its weight equal to the weight of the fluid\r\nwhich it displaces.” Everybody has verified this principle, and knows\r\nthat objects are much lighter in water than out of it; a body plunged\r\ninto water being acted upon by two forces--its own weight, which tends\r\nto sink it, and resistance from below, which tends to bear it up. But\r\nthis principle applies to gas as well as to liquids--to air as well as\r\nto water. When we weigh a body in the air, we do not find its absolute\r\nweight, but that weight minus the weight of the air which the body\r\ndisplaces. In order to know the exact weight of an object, it would be\r\nnecessary to weigh it in a vacuum.\r\n\r\nIf an object thrown into the air is heavier than the air which it\r\ndisplaces, it descends, and falls upon the earth; if it is of equal\r\nweight, it floats without rising or falling; if it is lighter, it\r\nrises until it comes to a stratum of air of less weight or density than\r\nitself. We all know, of course, that the higher you rise from the earth\r\nthe density of the air diminishes. The stratum of air that lies upon the\r\nsurface of the earth is the heaviest, because it supports the pressure\r\nof all the other strata that lie above. Thus the lightest strata are the\r\nhighest.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the construction of balloons is, therefore, in perfect\r\nharmony with physical laws. Balloons are simply globes, made of a light,\r\nair-tight material, filled with hot air or hydrogen gas which rise in\r\nthe air because (they are lighter than the air they displace).\r\n\r\nThe application of this principle appeared so simple, that at the time\r\nwhen the news of the invention of the balloon was spread abroad the\r\nastronomer Lalande wrote--“At this news we all cry, ‘This must be! Why\r\ndid we not think of it before?’” It had been thought of before, as we\r\nhave seen in the last chapter, but it is often long after an idea is\r\nconceived that it is practically realised.\r\n\r\nThe first balloon, Montgolfier’s, was simply filled with hot air; and it\r\nwas because Montgolfier exclusively made use of hot air that balloons\r\nso filled were named Montgolfiers. Of course we see at a glance that\r\nhot air is lighter than cold air, because it has become expanded and\r\noccupies more space--that is to say, a volume of hot air contains\r\nactually less air than a volume of the same size of air that has not\r\nbeen heated. The difference between the weight of the hot air and the\r\ncold which it displaced was greater than the weight of tire covering of\r\nthe balloon. Therefore the balloon mounted.\r\n\r\nAnd, seeing that air diminishes in density the higher we ascend, the\r\nballoon can rise only to that stratum of air of the same density as the\r\nair it contains. As the warm air cools it gently descends. Again, as the\r\natmosphere is always moving in currents more or less strong, the balloon\r\nfollows the direction of the current of the stratum of air in which it\r\nfinds itself.\r\n\r\nThus we see how simply the ascent of Montgolfiers, and their motions,\r\nare explained. It is the same with gas-balloons. A balloon, filled with\r\nhydrogen gas, displaces an equal volume of atmospheric air; but as the\r\ngas is much lighter than the air, it is pushed up by a force equal to\r\nthe difference of the density of air and hydrogen gas. The balloon then\r\nrises in the atmosphere to where it reaches layers of air of a density\r\nexactly equal to its own, and when it gets there it remains poised in\r\nits place. In order that it may descend, it is necessary to let out a\r\nportion of the hydrogen gas, and admit an equal quantity of atmospheric\r\nair; and the balloon does not come to the ground till all, or nearly\r\nall, the gas has been expelled and common air taken in. Balloons\r\ninflated with hydrogen gas are almost the only ones in use at the\r\npresent day. Scarcely ever is a Montgolfier sent up. There are\r\naeronauts, however, who prefer a journey in a Montgolfier to one in a\r\ngas-balloon. The air voyager in this description of balloon had formerly\r\nmany difficulties to contend with. The quantity of combustible material\r\nwhich he was bound to carry with him; the very little difference that\r\nthere is between the density of heated and of cold air; the necessity\r\nof feeding the fire, and watching it without a moment’s cessation, as it\r\nhangs in the rechaud over the middle of the car, rendered this sort of\r\nair travelling subject to many dangers and difficulties. Recently, M.\r\nEugene Godard has obviated a portion of this difficulty by fitting a\r\nchimney, like that which is found of such incalculable service in the\r\ncase of the Davy lamp. It is principally on account of this improvement\r\nthat the Montgolfiere has risen so highly in popular esteem.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is not pure hydrogen that is made use of in the inflation\r\nof balloons. Aeronauts content themselves with the gas which we burn in\r\nour streets and houses, and thus it suffices, in inflating the balloon,\r\nto obtain from the nearest gas-works the quantity of gas necessary, and\r\nto lead it, by means of a pipe or tube, from the gasometer to the mouth\r\nor neck of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe balloon is made of long strips of silk, sewn together, and rendered\r\nair-tight by means of a coating of caoutchouc. A valve is fitted to the\r\ntop, and by means of it the aeronaut can descend to the earth at will,\r\nby allowing some quantity of the gas to escape. The car in which he\r\nsits is suspended to the balloon by a network, which covers the whole\r\nstructure. Sacks of sand are carried in this car as ballast, so\r\nthat, when descending, if the aeronaut sees that he is likely to be\r\nprecipitated into the sea or into a lake, he throws over the sand, and\r\nhis air-carriage, being thus lightened, mounts again and travels away to\r\na more desirable resting-place. The idea of the valve, as well as that\r\nof the sand ballast, is due to the physician Charles. They enable the\r\naeronaut to ascend or descend with facility. When he wishes to mount,\r\nhe throws over his ballast; when he wants to come down, he lets the gas\r\nescape by the valve at the roof of the balloon. This valve is worked by\r\nmeans of a spring, having a long rope attached to it, which hangs down\r\nthrough the neck to the car, where the aeronaut sits.\r\n\r\nThe operation of inflating a balloon with pure hydrogen is represented\r\nin the engraving on the next page.\r\n\r\nShavings of iron and zinc, water, and sulphuric acid, occupy a number of\r\ncasks, which communicate, by means of tubes, with a central cask, which\r\nis open at the bottom, and is plunged in a copper full of water. The gas\r\nis produced by the action of the water and the sulphuric acid upon the\r\nzinc and the iron this is hydrogen mixed with sulphuric acid. In passing\r\nthrough the central copper, or vat, full of water, the gas throws off\r\nall impurities, and comes, unalloyed with any other matter, into the\r\nballoon by a long tube, leading from the central vats. In order to\r\nfacilitate the entrance of the gas into the balloon two long poles\r\nare erected. These are furnished with pulleys, through which a rope,\r\nattached also to a ring at the top of the balloon, passes. By means\r\nof this contrivance the balloon can be at once lightly raised from the\r\nground, and the gas tubes easily joined to it. When it is half full it\r\nis no longer necessary to suspend the balloon; on the contrary, it has\r\nto be secured, lest it should fly off. A number of men hold it back by\r\nropes; but as the force of ascension is every moment increasing, the\r\nwork of restraining the balloon is most difficult and exciting. At\r\nlength, all preparations being complete, the car is suspended, the\r\naeronaut takes his seat, the words “Let go all!” are shouted, and away\r\ngoes the silken globe into space.\r\n\r\nThe balloon is never entirely filled, for the atmospheric pressure\r\ndiminishing as it ascends, allows the hydrogen gas to dilate, in virtue\r\nof its expansive force, and, unless there is space for this expansion,\r\nthe balloon is sure to explode in the air.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary balloon, with a lifting power sufficient to carry up three\r\npersons, with necessary ballast and materiel, is about fifty feet high,\r\nthirty-five feet in diameter’ and 2,250 cubic feet in capacity. Of such\r\na balloon, the accessories--the skin, the network, the car--would weigh\r\nabout 335 lbs.\r\n\r\nTo find out the height at which he has arrived, the aeronaut consults\r\nhis barometer. We know that it is the pressure of the air upon the cup\r\nof the barometer that raises the mercury in the tube. The heavier the\r\nair is, the higher is the barometer. At the level of the sea the column\r\nof mercury stands at 32 inches; at 3,250 feet--the air being at this\r\nelevation lighter--the mercury stands at 28 inches; at 6,500 feet above\r\nsea level it stands at 25 inches; at 10,000 feet it falls to 22 inches;\r\nat 20,000 feet to 15 inches. These, however, are merely the theoretic\r\nresults, and are subject to some slight variation, according to\r\nlocality, &c.\r\n\r\nSometimes the aeronaut makes his descent by means of the parachute,\r\na separate and distinct contrivance. If, from any cause, it appears\r\nimpracticable to effect a descent from the balloon itself, the parachute\r\nmay be of the greatest service to the voyager at the present day it is\r\nchiefly used to astonish the public, by showing them the spectacle of\r\na man who, from a great elevation in the air, precipitates himself into\r\nspace, not to escape dangers which threaten him in his balloon, but\r\nsimply to exhibit his courage and skill. Nevertheless, parachutes are\r\noften of great actual use, and aeronauts frequently attach them to their\r\nballoons as a precautionary measure before setting out on an aerial\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\nThe shape of a parachute, shown on the previous page, very much\r\nresembles that of the well-known all serviceable umbrella. The strips of\r\nsilk of which it is formed are sewn together, and are bound at the top\r\naround a circular piece of wood. A number of cords, stretching away from\r\nthis piece of wood, support the car in which the aeronaut is carried. At\r\nthe summit is contrived an opening, which permits the air compressed\r\nby the rapidity of the descent to escape without causing damage to the\r\nparachute from the stress to which it is subjected.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of the descent is arrested by the large surface which the\r\nparachute presents to the air. When the aeronaut wishes to descend by\r\nthe parachute, all that is required is, after he has slipped down from\r\nthe car of the balloon to that of the parachute, to loosen the rope\r\nwhich binds the latter to the former, which is done by means of a\r\npulley. In an instant the aeronaut is launched into space with a\r\nrapidity in comparison with which the wild flights of the balloon are\r\nbut gentle oscillations. But in a few moments, the air rushing into\r\nthe folds of the parachute, forces them open like an umbrella, and\r\nimmediately, owing to the wide surface which this contrivance presents\r\nto the atmosphere, the violence of the descent is arrested, and the\r\naeronaut falls gently to the ground, without receiving too rude a shock.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of the parachute were first tried upon animals. Thus,\r\nBlanchard allowed his dog to fall in one from a height of 6,500 feet.\r\nA gust of wind caught the falling parachute, and swept it away up above\r\nthe clouds. Afterwards, the aeronaut in his balloon fell in with the dog\r\nin the parachute, both of them high up in the cloudy reaches of the\r\nsky, and the poor animal manifested by his barking his joy at seeing his\r\nmaster. A new current separated the aerial voyagers, but the parachute,\r\nwith its canine passenger, reached the ground safely a short time after\r\nBlanchard had landed from his balloon.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that, in the case of a descending parachute, if\r\nthe rapidity of the descent is doubled the resistance of the air is\r\nquadrupled; if the rapidity is triple the resistance is increased\r\nninefold; or, to speak in language of science, the resistance of the air\r\nis increased by the square of the swiftness of the body in motion. This\r\nresistance increases in proportion as the parachute spreads, and thus\r\nthe uniformity of its fall is established a minute after it has been\r\ndisengaged from the balloon. We can, therefore, check the descent of a\r\nbody by giving it a surface capable of distension by the action of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nGarnerin, in the year 1802, conceived the bold design of letting himself\r\nfall from a height of 1,200 feet, and he accomplished the exploit before\r\nthe Parisians. When he had reached the height he had fixed beforehand,\r\nhe cut the rope which connected the parachute with the balloon. At first\r\nthe fall was terribly rapid; but as soon as the parachute spread out\r\nthe rapidity was considerably diminished. The machine made, however,\r\nenormous oscillations. The air, gathering end compressed under it, would\r\nsometimes escape by one side sometimes by the other, thus shaking and\r\nwhirling the parachute about with a violence which, however great, had\r\nhappily no unfortunate effect.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the parachute is more remote than is generally supposed,\r\nas there was a figure of one which appeared among a collection of\r\nmachines at Venice, in 1617.\r\n\r\nAnother species of parachute, less perfect, to be sure; than that of\r\nGarnerin, but still a practical machine, was described 189 years before\r\nthe great aeronaut’s feat at Paris. We read in the narrative of the\r\nambassador of Louis XIV at Siam, at the end of the seventeenth century,\r\nthe following passage--“A mountebank at the court of the King of Siam\r\nclimbed to the top of a high bamboo-tree, and threw himself into the air\r\nwithout any other support than two parasols. Thus equipped, he abandoned\r\nhimself to the winds, which carried him, as by chance, sometimes to\r\nthe earth, sometimes on trees or houses, and sometimes into the river,\r\nwithout any harm happening to him.”\r\n\r\nIs not this the idea of our parachutes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. First Public Trial of the Balloon.\r\n\r\n(Montgolfier’s Balloon Annonay, 5th of June of 1783.)\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to rank the brothers Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier\r\nas equally distinguished in the field of science. The reason for thus\r\nassociating these two names seems to have been the fraternal friendship\r\nwhich subsisted in an extraordinary degree in the Montgolfier family,\r\nrather than any equality of claim which they had to the notice of\r\nposterity. After special investigation, we find that Joseph Montgolfier\r\nwas very superior to his brother, and that it is to him principally, if\r\nnot exclusively, that we owe the invention of aerostation. Nevertheless,\r\nwe shall not insist upon this fact; and seeing that a sacred amity\r\nalways cemented a perfect union in the Montgolfier family, we will\r\nregard that union as unbroken in any sense, and will not insinuate that\r\nthe brother of Montgolfier was undeserving of the honoured rank which in\r\nhis lifetime he held.\r\n\r\nIn 1783, the sons of Pierre Montgolfier, a rich papermaker at Annonay\r\ndepartment of Ardeche, were already in the prime of life, and it is\r\nrelated of them that their principal occupation was experimenting in the\r\nphysical sciences. Joseph Montgolfier, after being convinced by a number\r\nof minor experiments made in 1782 and 1783, that a heat of 180 degrees\r\nrarefied the air and made it occupy a space of TWICE the extent it\r\noccupied before being heated--or, in other words, that this degree of\r\nheat diminished the weight of air by one half--began to speculate on\r\nwhat might be the shape and the material of a structure which being\r\nfilled with air thus heated, would be able to raise itself from the\r\nearth in spite of the weight of its own covering.\r\n\r\nHis first balloon was a small parallelopiped in very thin taffeta,\r\ncontaining less than seventy-eight cubic inches of air. He made it rise\r\nto the roof of his apartment in November, 1782--at Avignon, where he\r\nthen happened to be. Having returned some little time after to Annonay,\r\nJoseph and his brother performed the same experiment, together in the\r\nopen air with perfect success. Certain, then, of the new principle, they\r\nmade a balloon of considerable size, containing upwards of sixty-five\r\nfeet of heated air.\r\n\r\nThis machine likewise rose, tore away the cords by which it was at first\r\nheld down, and mounting in the air to the height of from two to three\r\nhundred feet, fell upon the neighbouring hills after a considerable\r\nflight. The brothers Montgolfier then made a very large and strong\r\nballoon, with which they wished to bring their discovery before the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe appointed day was the 5th of June, 1783 and the nobility of the\r\nvicinity were invited to be present at the experiment. Faujas de\r\nSaint Fond, author of “La Description des Experiences de la Machine\r\nAerostatique,” published the same year, gives the following account of\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n“What,” says Saint Fond, “was the general astonishment when the\r\ninventors of the machine announced that immediately it should be full\r\nof gas, which they had the means of producing at will by the most simple\r\nprocess, it would raise itself to the clouds. It must be granted that,\r\nin spite of the confidence in the ingenuity and experience of the\r\nMontgolfiers, this feat seemed so incredible to those who came to\r\nwitness it, that the persons who knew most about it--who were, at the\r\nsame time, the most favourably predisposed in its favour--doubted of its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n“At last the brothers Montgolfier commenced their work. They first\r\nof all began to make the smoke necessary for their experiment. The\r\nmachine--which at first seemed only a covering of cloth, lined with\r\npaper, a sort of sack thirty-five feet high--became inflated, and grew\r\nlarge even under the eyes of the spectator, took consistence, assumed a\r\nbeautiful form, stretched itself on all sides, and struggled to escape.\r\nMeanwhile, strong arms were holding it down until the signal was given,\r\nwhen it loosened itself, and with a rush rose to the height of 1,000\r\nfathoms in less than ten minutes.” It then described a horizontal line\r\nof 7,200 feet, and as it had lost a considerable amount of gas, it began\r\nto descend quietly. It reached the ground in safety; and this first\r\nattempt, crowned with such decisive success, secured for ever to\r\nthe brothers Montgolfier the glory of one of the most astonishing\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n“When we reflect for a moment upon the numberless difficulties which\r\nsuch a bold attempt entailed, upon the bitter criticism to which it\r\nwould have exposed its projectors had it failed through any accident,\r\nand upon the sums that must have been spent in carrying it out, we\r\ncannot withhold the highest admiration for the men who conceived the\r\nidea and carried it out to such a successful issue.”\r\n\r\nEtienne Montgolfier has left us a description of this first balloon.\r\n“The aerostatic machine,” he says, “was constructed of cloth lined with\r\npaper, fastened together on a network of strings fixed to the cloth.\r\nIt was spherical; its circumference was 110 feet, and a wooden frame\r\nsixteen feet square held it fixed at the bottom. Its contents were about\r\n22,000 cubic feet, and it accordingly displaced a volume of air weighing\r\n1,980 1bs. The weight of the gas was nearly half the weight of the air,\r\nfor it weighed 990 lbs., and the machine itself, with the frame, weighed\r\n500: it was, therefore, impelled upwards with the force of 490 lbs. Two\r\nmen sufficed to raise it and to fill it with gas, but it took eight\r\nto hold it down till the signal was given. The different pieces of\r\nthe covering were fastened together with buttons and button-holes.\r\nIt remained ten minutes in the air, but the loss of gas by the\r\nbutton-holes, and by other imperfections, did not permit it to continue\r\nlonger. The wind at the moment of the ascent was from the north. The\r\nmachine came down so lightly that no part of it was broken.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. Second Experiment.\r\n\r\n(Charles’s Balloon, Paris, Champ de Mars, 27th of August, 1783.)\r\n\r\nThe indescribable enthusiasm caused by the ascent of the first balloon\r\nat Annonay, spread in all directions, and excited the wondering\r\ncuriosity of the savants of the capital. An official report had been\r\nprepared, and sent to the Academy of Sciences in Paris, and the result\r\nwas that the Academy named a commission of inquiry. But fame, more rapid\r\nthan scientific commissions, and more enthusiastic than academies,\r\nhad, at a single flight, passed from Annonay to Paris, and kindled the\r\nanxious ardour of the lovers of science in that city. The great desire\r\nwas to rival Montgolfier, although neither the report nor the\r\nletters from Annonay had made mention of the kind of gas used by that\r\nexperimenter to inflate his balloon. By one of the frequent coincidences\r\nin the history of the sciences, hydrogen gas had been discovered six\r\nyears previously by the great English physician Cavendish, and it had\r\nhardly even been tested in the laboratories of the chemists when it all\r\nat once became famous. A young man well versed in physics, Professor\r\nCharles, assisted by two practical men, the brothers Robert, threw\r\nhimself ardently into the investigation of the modes of inflating\r\nballoons with this gas, which was then called INFLAMMABLE AIR. Guessing\r\nthat it was much lighter than that which Montgolfier had been obliged to\r\nmake use of in his third-rate provincial town, Charles leagued himself\r\nwith his two assistants to constrict a balloon of taffeta, twelve feet\r\nin diameter, covered with india-rubber, and to inflate it with hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe thing thus arranged, a subscription was opened. The projected\r\nexperiment having been talked of all over Paris, every one was struck\r\nwith the idea, and subscriptions poured in. Even the most illustrious\r\nnames are to be found in the list, which may be called the first\r\nnational subscription in France. Nothing had been written of the\r\nforthcoming event in any public paper, yet all Paris seemed to flock to\r\ncontribute to the curious experiment.\r\n\r\nThe inflation with hydrogen was effected in a very curious manner. As\r\nmuch as 1,125 lbs. of iron and 560 lbs. of sulphuric acid were found\r\nnecessary to inflate a balloon which had scarcely a lifting power of\r\n22 lbs., and the process of filling took no less than four hours. At\r\nlength, however, at the end of the fourth hour, the balloon, composed of\r\nstrips of silk, coated with varnish, floated, two-thirds full, from the\r\nworkshop of the brothers Robert.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 26th of August, the day before the ascent was\r\nto be made, the balloon was visited at daybreak, and found to be in\r\na promising state. At two o’clock on the following morning its\r\nconstructors began to make preparations to transport it to the Champ\r\nde Mars, from which place it was to be let loose. Skilled workmen were\r\nemployed in its removal, and every precaution was taken that the gas\r\nwith which it was charged should not be allowed to escape. In the\r\nmeantime the excitement of the people about this wonderful structure\r\nwas rising to the highest pitch. The wagon on which it was placed\r\nfor removal was surrounded on all sides by eager multitudes, and the\r\nnight-patrols, both of horse and foot, which were set to guard the\r\navenues leading to where it lay, were quite unable to stem the tide of\r\nhuman beings that poured along to get a glimpse of it.\r\n\r\nThe conveyance of the balloon to the Champ de Mars was a most singular\r\nspectacle. A vanguard, with lighted torches, preceded it; it was\r\nsurrounded by special attendants, and was followed by detachments of\r\nnight-patrols on foot and mounted. The size and shape of this structure,\r\nwhich was escorted with such pomp and precaution--the silence that\r\nprevailed--the unearthly hour, all helped to give an air of mystery\r\nto the proceedings. At last, having passed through the principal\r\nthoroughfares, it arrived at the Champ de Mars, where it was placed in\r\nan enclosure prepared for its reception.\r\n\r\nWhen the dawn came, and the balloon had been fixed in its place by\r\ncords, attached around its middle and fixed to iron rings planted in the\r\nearth, the final process of inflation began.\r\n\r\nThe Champ de Mars was guarded by troops, and the avenues were also\r\nguarded on all sides. As the day wore on an immense crowd covered the\r\nopen space, and every advantageous spot in the neighborhood was crowded\r\nwith people. At five o’clock the report of a cannon announced to the\r\nmultitudes, and to scientific men who were posted on elevations to make\r\nobservations of the great event, that the grand moment had come. The\r\ncords were withdrawn, and, to the vast delight and wonder of the crowd\r\nassembled, the balloon shot up with such rapidity that in two minutes it\r\nhad ascended 488 fathoms. At this height it was lost in a cloud for an\r\ninstant, and, reappearing, rose to a great height, and was again lost\r\nin higher clouds. The ascent was a splendid success. The rain that fell\r\ndamped neither the balloon nor the ardor of the spectators.\r\n\r\nThis balloon was 12 feet in diameter, 38 feet in circumference, and had\r\na capacity of 943 cubic feet. The weight of the materials of which it\r\nwas constructed was 25 lbs., and the force of ascension was that of 35\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the balloon was caused by the expansion and consequent\r\nexplosion of the hydrogen gas. This event took place some distance out\r\nin the country, close to a number of peasants, whose terror at the\r\nsight and the sound of this strange monster from the skies was beyond\r\ndescription. The people assembled, and two monks having told them that\r\nthe burst balloon was the hide of a monstrous animal, they immediately\r\nbegan to assail it vigorously with stones, flails, and pitchforks. The\r\ncure of the parish was obliged to walk up to the balloon to reassure his\r\nterrified flock. They finally attached the burst envelope to a horse’s\r\ntail, and dragged it far across the fields.\r\n\r\nMany drawings and engravings of the period represent the peasants armed\r\nwith pitchforks, flails, and scythes, assailing it, a dog snapping at\r\nit, a garde-champetre firing at it, a fat priest preaching at it, and a\r\ntroop of young people throwing stones at the unfortunate machine.\r\n\r\nThe news of this fiasco came to Paris, but too late. When search was\r\nmade for the covering, scarcely a fragment could be found.\r\n\r\nA somewhat humorous result of all this was the issue of a communication\r\nfrom government to the people, entitled, “Warning to the People on\r\nkidnapping Air-balloons.” This document, duly signed and approved of,\r\ndescribes the ascents at Annonay and at Paris, explains the nature and\r\nthe causes of the phenomena, and warns the people not to be alarmed when\r\nthey see something like a “black moon” in the sky, nor to give way to\r\nfear, as the seeming monster is nothing more than a bag of silk filled\r\nwith gas.\r\n\r\nThis first ascent in Paris was an important event. Every one, from the\r\nsmallest to the greatest, was deeply interested in it, while to the man\r\nof science it was one of the most exciting of incidents. For the purpose\r\nof observing the altitude to which the balloon rose, and the course it\r\ntook, Le Gentil was on the observatory, Prevost was on one of the towers\r\nof Notre Dame, Jeaurat was on La Place Louis XV., and d’Agelet was on\r\nthe Champ de Mars. It was only Lalande that frowned as he witnessed\r\nthe success of the experiment. He had predicted the year before that\r\nair-navigation was impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Third Experiment.\r\n\r\n(Montgolfier’s Balloon, Paris, Faubourg St. Antoine.)\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the triumph of aerostation was sudden and complete. The\r\nyoung Montgolfier had arrived in Paris prior to the experiment of the\r\n27th of August, and was present as a simple spectator on that occasion.\r\nimmediately afterwards he set to work upon a balloon, which was to\r\nbe made use of when the Academy should investigate the phenomenon at\r\nVersailles in presence of the king, Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time (September, 1783) that those small balloons, made\r\nof gold-beaters’ skin, which are used as children’s toys to the present\r\nday, were first made. The whole of Paris amused itself with them,\r\nrepeating in little the phenomenon of the great ascent. The sky of the\r\ncapital found itself all at once traversed by a multitude of small rosy\r\nclouds, formed by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nFaujas de Saint Fond says that at first an attempt was made to construct\r\nballoons of fine, light paper; but this material being permeable, and\r\nthe gas being inflammable, balloons thus made did not succeed. It\r\nwas necessary to seek a material less porous, and, if possible, still\r\nlighter.\r\n\r\nThe Journal de Paris, of the 11th of September, 1783, informed the\r\npublic that the Baron de Beaumanoir, “who cultivated the sciences and\r\nthe fine arts with as much success as zeal,” would send up a balloon\r\neighteen inches in diameter. At noon of the same day he made this\r\nexperiment in presence of a numerous assembly in the garden in front of\r\nthe Hotel de Surgeres.. The little balloon mounted freely, but was held\r\nin, like a kite, by means of a silk thread. In the course of the same\r\nafternoon, the baron took down the balloon and filled it anew with\r\nhydrogen, and then let it off. The spectators had the pleasure of seeing\r\nit rise to a great height, and pass away in the direction of Neuilly,\r\nand it is said to have been found at a distance of several leagues, by\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nHowever trifling this experiment may appear at first sight, it added\r\na new fact to the science of aerostation. The material employed by\r\nthe baron was lighter and better than paper. It was what is called\r\ngold-beaters’ skin. This skin is simply the interior lining of the\r\nlarge bowel of the ox. It is carefully prepared, is relieved of the fat,\r\nstringy and uneven parts, is dried, and is afterwards softened. Little\r\nballoons of this material came to be the fashion, and they are still\r\nfrequently seen.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Montgolfier was busy constructing, at the request\r\nof the Academy of Sciences, a balloon seventy feet high and forty\r\nin diameter, with which it was proposed to repeat the experiment of\r\nAnnonay. He took up his quarters in the magnificent gardens of his\r\nfriend Reveillon, proprietor of the royal manufactory of stained paper\r\nin the Faubourg St. Antoine. The new balloon was of a very singular\r\nshape: the upper part represented a prism, twenty-four feet high the top\r\nwas a pyramid of the same height; the lower part was a truncated cone,\r\ntwenty feet in depth. It was made of packing-cloth, lined with good\r\npaper, both inside and out.\r\n\r\nThe gossipping and prolix Faujas de Saint Fond thus describes this\r\nmachine:--“It was painted blue, represented a sort of tent, and was\r\nrichly ornamented with gold Its height was seventy feet; its weight\r\n1,000 lbs.; the air which it displaced was 4,500 lbs. in volume, and the\r\nvapor with which it was filled was half the weight of ordinary air. The\r\napproach of the equinox having brought rain, all the conditions under\r\nwhich this balloon was constructed and exhibited were unfavourable. The\r\nstructure was so large that it was impossible to get it together\r\nand stitch it, except in the open air--in the garden, in fact, where\r\nMontgolfier commenced its construction. It was a great labour to turn\r\nand fold this heavy covering, while the liability of the thick paper\r\nto crack was an additional difficulty. Not less than twenty men were\r\nrequired to move it, and they were obliged to use all their skill, and\r\nevery precaution, not to destroy it. No balloon had ever given so much\r\ntrouble. On the 11th of September the weather improved, and the balloon\r\nwas entirely completed and prepared for the first experiment. In the\r\nevening the attempt was made. It was with admiration that the beholders\r\nsaw the beautiful machine filling itself in the short space of nine\r\nminutes, swelling out on all sides and showing the full symmetry of its\r\nartistic form. It was firmly held in hand, or it would have risen to a\r\ngreat height. On the following day the actual ascent was to take place,\r\nand the commissioners of the Academy of Sciences were invited to be\r\npresent. In the morning thick clouds covered the horizon, and a tempest\r\nwas expected; but as there was an ardent desire that the ascent should\r\ntake place without delay, and as all the gearing was in order, it was\r\nresolved to proceed.\r\n\r\n“Fifty pounds of dry straw were fired in parcels under the balloon, and\r\nupon the fire were thrown at intervals several pounds of wool. This fuel\r\nproduced in ten minutes such a volume of smoke that the huge balloon was\r\nspeedily filled. It rose, with a weight of 500 lbs. holding it down, to\r\nsome height above the ground, and had the ropes by which it was attached\r\nto the ground been cut, it would have mounted to a great height.\r\nMeantime the storm broke, rain descended, and the wind blew with great\r\nforce. The most likely means of saving the balloon was to let it fly\r\nbut as it was to ascend again on another occasion, at Versailles, the\r\ngreatest efforts were made to bring it down, and these, together with\r\nthe damage caused by the storm, eventually rent it into numberless\r\nfragments and tatters. It withstood the storm for twenty-four hours;\r\nthen, however, the paper came peeling off, and this beautiful structure\r\nwas a wreck.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. Fourth Experiment.\r\n\r\n(Versailles, 19th September, 1783, in presence of Louis of XVI.)\r\n\r\nOf course another balloon was wanted for the fete at Versailles. The\r\nking had demanded an ascent for the 19th, a week after the disaster at\r\nthe Faubourg St. Antoine. Already the possibility of a man going up with\r\nthe balloon was discussed, and people indulged in visions of splendid\r\naerial trips; but the king would not hear of the proposal. Balloons were\r\nnovelties, not offering sufficient security, and he was unwilling that\r\nany of his subjects should risk their lives in attempting the unknown.\r\nHe consented, however, to a proposal that animals might be sent up in\r\nthe first instance, by way of experiment, suspended in an osier cage\r\nattached to the neck of the balloon.\r\n\r\nMontgolfier at once began a new balloon. A few days only were at his\r\ndisposal; but, assisted by friends, he worked with such ardour\r\nand success that he was able, on the date appointed, to produce\r\na magnificent spherical balloon, much stronger than the former,\r\nconstructed of good strong cotton cloth, and painted in distemper.\r\n\r\nIt is proper here to remark that the first balloons were much more\r\nelegant in appearance than those afterwards made. The coloured prints\r\nand engravings of the period enable us to form an opinion of the\r\nsplendour of their ornamentation and the beauty of their design.\r\nSometimes the figures painted upon them represented scenes from\r\nthe heathen mythology, and sometimes historical scenes; while rich\r\nembroideries, royal insignia, and gaily-coloured draperies added much\r\nto the general effect. The Versailles balloon was painted blue, with\r\nornaments of gold, and it presented the form of a richly decorated tent.\r\nIt was fifty-seven feet in height, and sixty-seven in diameter.\r\n\r\nIt was first tried at Paris, and succeeded perfectly. On the morning of\r\nthe 19th it was carried to Versailles, where due preparation had been\r\nmade for its reception In the great court of the castle a sort of\r\ntheatre had been temporarily erected with a scaffolding, covered\r\nthroughout with tapestry In the middle was an opening more than fifteen\r\nfeet in diameter, in which was spread a banquet for those who had\r\nconstructed the balloon. A numerous guard formed a double cordon around\r\nthe structure. A raised platform was used for the fire by means of which\r\nthe balloon was to be inflated; a covered funnel or chimney of strong\r\ncloth, painted, was suspended over the fire-place, and received the hot\r\nsmoke as it arose. Through this funnel the heated air ascended straight\r\nup into the balloon.\r\n\r\nAt six in the morning, the road from Paris to Versailles was covered\r\nwith carriages. Crowds came from all parts, and at noon the avenues,\r\nthe square of the castle, the windows, and even the roofs of the houses,\r\nwere crowded with spectators. The noblest, the most illustrious, and\r\nmost learned men in France were present, and the splendour of the scene\r\nwas complete when their majesties and the royal family entered within\r\nthe enclosure, and went forward to inspect the balloon, and to make\r\nthemselves familiar with the preparations for the ascent.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the fire was lit, the funnel extended over it, and the\r\nsmoke rose inside, while the balloon, unfolding, gradually swelled to\r\nits full size, and then, drawing after it the cage, in which a sheep\r\nand some pigeons were enclosed, rose majestically into the air. Without\r\ninterreruption, it ascended to a vast height, where, inclining toward\r\nthe north, it seemed to remain stationary for a few seconds, showing\r\nall the beauty of its form, and then, as though possessed of life, it\r\ndescended gently upon the wood of Vaucresson, 10,200 feet from the point\r\nof its departure. Its highest elevation, as estimated by the astronomers\r\nLe Gentil and M. Jeaurat, Jeaurat, was about 1,700 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. Men and Balloons.\r\n\r\nIt is not natural that the human mind should stop upon the way to the\r\nsolution of a problem, especially when it seems to be on the point of\r\narriving at a satisfactory conclusion to its labours. The osier cage\r\nof Versailles very soon transformed itself into a car, bearing human\r\npassengers, and the age of the “Thousand and One Nights” was expected\r\nto come back again. It was resolved to continue experiments, with the\r\ndirect object of finding out whether it was impossible or desperately\r\ndangerous for man to travel in balloons. Montgolfier returned from\r\nVersailles, and constructed a new machine in the gardens of the Faubourg\r\nSt. Antoine. It was completed on the 10th of October Its form was oval,\r\nits height 70 feet, its diameter 46 feet and its capacity 60,000 cubic\r\nfeet. The upper part, embroidered with fleurs-de-lis, was further\r\nornamented with the twelve signs of the zodiac, worked in gold. The\r\nmiddle part bore the monogram of the king, alternating with figures of\r\nthe sun, while the lower part was garnished with masks, garlands, and\r\nspread eagles. A circular gallery made of osiers and festooned with\r\ndraperies and other ornaments, was attached by a set of cords to the\r\nbottom of the structure. The gallery was three feet wide, and was\r\nprotected by a parapet over three feet in height. It did not in any way\r\ninterfere with the opening at the neck of the balloon, under which\r\nwas suspended a grating of iron wire upon which the occupants of the\r\ngallery, who were to be provided with dried straw and wool, could in\r\na few minutes kindle a fire and create fresh smoke, when that in the\r\nballoon began to be exhausted. The machine weighed, in all, 1,600 lbs.\r\nThe public had previously been warned, in the Journal de Paris de Paris,\r\nthat the approaching experiments were to be of a strictly scientific\r\ncharacter; and as they would be only interesting to savants, they would\r\nnot afford amusement for the merely curious. This announcement was\r\nnecessary, to abate in some degree the excitement of the people until\r\nsome satisfactory results should be obtained; it was also necessary for\r\nthose engaged in the work, whose firmness of nerve might have suffered\r\nfrom the enthusiastic cries of excited spectators. On Wednesday, the\r\n15th of October, Pilatre des Roziers, who had on other occasions given\r\nproofs of his intelligence and courage in performing dangerous feats,\r\nand who had already signalised himself in connection with balloons,\r\noffered to go up in the new machine. His offer was accepted; the balloon\r\nwas inflated; stout ropes, more than eighty feet long, were attached\r\nto it, and it rose from the ground to the height to which this tackle\r\nallowed it. At this elevation it remained four minutes twenty-five\r\nseconds; and it is not surprising to hear that Roziers suffered no\r\ninconvenience from the ascent. What was really the interesting thing in\r\nthis experiment was, that it showed how a balloon would fall when the\r\nhot air became exhausted, this being the point which caused the greatest\r\namount of disquietude among men of science. In this instance the balloon\r\nfell gently; its form distended at the same time, and, after touching\r\nthe ground, it rose again a foot or two, when its human passenger had\r\njumped out.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 17th of October, this experiment was repeated, and the\r\nexcitement of the public on this occasion was unbounded. “All the world”\r\n came to see. Roziers was again lifted up in the balloon, to the height\r\nof eighty feet; but so strong was the wind, and the strain on the ropes\r\nwas so great, that the balloon was somewhat unsteady, and the exhibition\r\nwas not on the whole such a splendid success as that of the preceding\r\nWednesday.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, Montgolfier chose a fine day for the following\r\nascents:--“First Ascent: On the 19th of October, 1783, at half-past\r\nfour, in presence of two thousand spectators, ‘the machine’ was filled\r\nwith gas in five minutes, and Roziers, being placed in the gallery with\r\na counterbalancing weight of 110 lbs. in the other side of the gallery,\r\nwas carried up to the height of 200 feet. The machine remained six\r\nminutes at this elevation without any fire in the grating. Second\r\nAscent: The machine carried Roziers and the counterbalancing\r\nweight--fire being in the grating--to the height of 700 feet. At this\r\nheight it remained stationary eight and a half minutes As it was drawn\r\nback, a wind from the east bore it against a tuft of very tall trees in\r\na neighbouring garden, where it got entangled, without, however, losing\r\nits equilibrium. The gas was renewed by Roziers, and the balloon\r\nagain rising, extricated itself from among the branches, and soared\r\nmajestically into the air, followed by the acclamations of the public.\r\nThis second ascent was very instructive, for it had been often asserted\r\nthat if ever a balloon fell upon a forest it would be destroyed, and\r\nwould place those who travelled in it in the greatest peril. This\r\nexperiment proved that the balloon does not FALL it DESCENDS; that it\r\ndoes not overturn; that it does not destroy itself on trees; that it\r\nneither causes death, nor even damage, to its passengers; that, on the\r\ncontrary, the latter, by making new gas, give it the power of detaching\r\nitself from the trees; and that it can resume its course after such an\r\nevent. The intrepid Roziers gave in this ascent a further proof of the\r\nfacility he had in descending and ascending at will. When the machine\r\nhad risen to the height of 200 feet it began to descend lightly, and\r\njust before it came to the earth the aeronaut very cleverly and quickly\r\nthrew on more fuel and produced more smoke, at which the balloon, to\r\nthe astonishment of every one, suddenly soared away again to its\r\nformer elevation. Third Ascent: The balloon rose again with Roziers,\r\naccompanied this time by another aeronaut, Gerond de Villette; and as\r\nthe cords had been lengthened, the adventurers were carried up to the\r\nheight of 324 feet. At this elevation the balloon rested in perfect\r\nequilibrium for nine minutes. It was the first time that human beings\r\nhad ever been carried to an equal elevation, and the spectators were\r\nastonished to find that they could remain there without danger and\r\nwithout alarm. The balloon had a superb effect at this elevation; it\r\nlooked down upon the whole town, and was seen from all the suburbs. Its\r\nsize seemed hardly diminished in the least, though the men themselves\r\nwere barely visible. By the aid of glasses, Roziers could be seen calmly\r\nand industriously making new gas. When the balloon descended the two men\r\ndeclared that they had not experienced the slightest inconvenience from\r\nthe elevation. They received the universal applause which their zeal and\r\ncourage so well deserved. The Marquis d’Arlandes, a major of infantry,\r\nafterwards went up with Roziers, and this latter experiment was as\r\nsuccessful as the former.”\r\n\r\nSome days after these experiments the conductors of the Journal de Paris\r\nwho described them, received a letter from Montgolfier, and also one\r\nfrom Gerond de Villette. The latter only is of interest here. Gerond\r\nde Villette says: “I found myself in the space of a quarter of a minute\r\nraised 400 feet above the surface of the earth. Here we remained six\r\nminutes. My first employment was to watch with admiration my intelligent\r\ncompanion. His intelligence, his courage and agility in attending to the\r\nfire, enchanted me. Turning round, I could behold the Boulevards, from\r\nthe gate of St. Antoine to that of St. Martin, all covered with people,\r\nwho seemed to me a flat band of flowers of various colours. Glancing at\r\nthe distance, I beheld the summit of Montmartre, which seemed to me much\r\nbelow our level. I could easily distinguish Neuilly, St. Cloud, Sevres,\r\nIssy, Ivry, Charenton, and Choisy. At once I was convinced that this\r\nmachine, though a somewhat expensive one, might be very useful in war\r\nto enable one to discover the position of the enemy, his manoeuvres,\r\nand his marches; and to announce these by signals to one’s own army. 1\r\nbelieve that at sea it is equally possible to make use of this machine.\r\nThese prove the usefulness of the balloon, which time will perfect\r\nfor us. All that I regret is that I did not provide myself with a\r\ntelescope.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. The First Aerial Voyage--Roziers and Arlandes.\r\n\r\n     These experiments had only one aim--the application of\r\n     Montgolfier’s discovery to aerial navigation.  The knowledge\r\n     gained in the Faubourg St. Antoine having led to the most\r\n     favourable conclusions, it was resolved that a first aerial\r\n     voyage should be attempted.\r\n\r\n“If,” says Linguet, “there existed an autograph journal, written by\r\nColumbus, descriptive of his first great voyage with what jealous care\r\nit would be preserved, with what confidence it would be quoted! We\r\nshould delight to follow the candid account which he gave of his\r\nthoughts, his hopes, his fears; of the complaints of his followers, of\r\nhis attempts to calm them, and, finally, of his joy in the moment\r\nwhich, ratifying his word and justifying his boldness, declared him the\r\ndiscoverer of a new world All these details have been transmitted to us,\r\nbut by stranger hands; and, however interesting they may be, one cannot\r\nhelp feeling that this circumstance makes them lose part of their\r\nvalue.”\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the first aerial voyage, written by one of the two\r\nfirst aeronauts, exists, and we are in a position to place it before our\r\nreaders. Such an enterprise certainly demanded great courage in him who\r\nwas the first to dare to confide himself to the unknown currents of the\r\natmosphere It threatened him with dangers, perhaps with death by a fill,\r\nby fire, by cold, or by straying into the mysterious cloud-land. Two men\r\nopposed the first attempt. Montgolfier temporised, the king forbade it,\r\nor rather only gave his permission on the condition that two condemned\r\ncriminals should be placed in the balloon! “What!” cried Roziers, in\r\nindignation at the king’s proposal, “allow two vile criminals to have\r\nthe first glory of rising into the sky! No, no; that will never do!”\r\n Roziers conjured, supplicated, agitated in a hundred ways for permission\r\nto try the first voyage. He moved the town and the court; he addressed\r\nhimself to those who were most in favour at Versailles; he pleaded with\r\nthe Duchess de Polignac, who was all-powerful with the king. She\r\nwarmly supported his cause before Louis. Roziers dispatched the Marquis\r\nd’Arlandes, who had been up with him, to the king. Arlandes asserted\r\nthat there was no danger, and, as proof of his conviction, he offered\r\nhimself to accompany Roziers. Solicited on all sides, Louis at last\r\nyielded.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of La Muette, near Paris, were fixed upon as the spot from\r\nwhich this aerial expedition should start. The Dauphin and his suite\r\nwere present on the occasion. It was on the 21st of October, 1783, at\r\none o’clock p.m., that Roziers and Irelands took their leave of the\r\nearth for the first time. The following is Arlandes’ narrative of the\r\nexpedition, given in the form of a letter, addressed by the marquis to\r\nFaujas de Saint Fond:--“You wish, my dear Faujas, and I consent most\r\nwillingly to your desires, that, owing to the number of questions\r\ncontinually addressed to me, and for other reasons, I should gratify\r\npublic curiosity and fix public opinion upon the subject of our aerial\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n“I wish to describe as well as I can the first journey which men have\r\nattempted through an element which, prior to the discovery of MM.\r\nMontgolfier, seemed so little fitted to support them.\r\n\r\n“We went up on the 21st of October, 1783, at near two o’clock, M.\r\nRoziers on the west side of the balloon, I on the east. The wind was\r\nnearly north-west. The machine, say the public, rose with majesty; but\r\nreally the position of the balloon altered so that M. Roziers was in the\r\nadvance of our position, I in the rear.\r\n\r\n“I was surprised at the silence and the absence of movement which\r\nour departure caused among the spectators, and believed them to be\r\nastonished and perhaps awed at the strange spectacle; they might well\r\nhave reassured themselves I was still gazing, when M. Roziers cried to\r\nme--\r\n\r\n“‘You are doing nothing, and the balloon is scarcely rising a fathom.’\r\n\r\n“‘Pardon me,’ I answered, as I placed a bundle of straw upon the fire\r\nand slightly stirred it. Then I turned quickly, but already we had\r\npassed out of sight of La Muette. Astonished, I cast a glance towards\r\nthe river. I perceived the confluence of the Oise. And naming the\r\nprincipal bends of the river by the places nearest them, I cried,\r\n‘Passy, St. Germain, St. Denis, Sevres!’\r\n\r\n“‘If you look at the river in that fashion you will be likely to bathe\r\nin it soon,’ cried Roziers. ‘Some fire, my dear friend, some fire!’\r\n\r\n“We travelled on; but instead of crossing the river, as our direction\r\nseemed to indicate, we bore towards the Invalides, then returned upon\r\nthe principal bed of the river, and travelled to above the barrier of La\r\nConference, thus dodging about the river, but not crossing it.\r\n\r\n“‘That river is very difficult to cross,’ I remarked to my companion.\r\n\r\n“‘So it seems,’ he answered; ‘but you are doing nothing I suppose it is\r\nbecause you are braver than I, and don’t fear a tumble.’\r\n\r\n“I stirred the fire, I seized a truss of straw with my fork; I raised\r\nit and threw it in the midst of the flames. An instant afterwards I felt\r\nmyself lifted as it were into the heavens.\r\n\r\n“‘For once we move,’ said I.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, we move,’ answered my companion.\r\n\r\n“At the same instant I heard from the top of the balloon a sound which\r\nmade me believe that it had burst. I watched, yet I saw nothing.\r\nMy companion had gone into the interior, no doubt to make some\r\nobservations. As my eyes were fixed on the top of the machine I\r\nexperienced a shock, and it was the only one I had yet felt. The\r\ndirection of the movement was from above downwards I then said--\r\n\r\n“‘What are you doing? Are you having a dance to yourself?’\r\n\r\n“‘I’m not moving.’\r\n\r\n“‘So much the better. It is only a new current which I hope will carry\r\nus from the river,’ I answered.\r\n\r\n“I turned to see where we were, and found we were between the Ecole\r\nMilitaire and the Invalides.\r\n\r\n“‘We are getting on.’ said Roziers.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, we are travelling.’\r\n\r\n“‘Let us work, let us work,’ said he.\r\n\r\n“I now heard another report in the machine, which I believed was\r\nproduced by the cracking of a cord. This new intimation made me\r\ncarefully examine the inside of our habitation. I saw that the part that\r\nwas turned towards the south was full of holes, of which some were of a\r\nconsiderable size.\r\n\r\n“‘It must descend,’ I then cried.\r\n\r\n“‘Why?’\r\n\r\n“‘Look!’ I said. At the same time I took my sponge and quietly\r\nextinguished the little fire that was burning some of the holes within\r\nmy reach; but at the same moment I perceived that the bottom of the\r\ncloth was coming away from the circle which surrounded it.\r\n\r\n“‘We must descend,’ I repeated to my companion.\r\n\r\n“He looked below.\r\n\r\n“‘We are upon Paris,’ he said.\r\n\r\n“‘It does not matter,’ I answered ‘Only look! Is there no danger? Are\r\nyou holding on well?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n“I examined from my side, and saw that we had nothing to fear. I then\r\ntried with my sponge the ropes which were within my reach. All of them\r\nheld firm. Only two of the cords had broken.\r\n\r\n“I then said, ‘We can cross Paris.’\r\n\r\n“During this operation we were rapidly getting down to the roofs. We\r\nmade more fire, and rose again with the greatest ease. I looked down,\r\nand it seemed to me we were going towards the towers of St. Sulpice;\r\nbut, on rising, a new current made us quit this direction and bear more\r\nto the south. I looked to the left, and beheld a wood, which I believed\r\nto be that of Luxembourg. We were traversing the boulevard, and I cried\r\nall at once--\r\n\r\n“‘Get to ground!’\r\n\r\n“But the intrepid Roziers, who never lost his head, and who judged more\r\nsurely than I, prevented me from attempting to descend. I then threw a\r\nbundle of straw on the fire. We rose again, and another current bore us\r\nto were now close to the ground, between two mills. As soon to the\r\nleft. We as we came near the earth I raised myself over the gallery,\r\nand leaning there with my two hands, I felt the balloon pressing softly\r\nagainst my head. I pushed it back, and leaped down to the ground.\r\nLooking round and expecting to see the balloon still distended, I was\r\nastonished to find it quite empty and flattened. On looking for Roziers\r\nI saw him in his shirt-sleeves creeping out from under the mass of\r\ncanvas that had fallen over him. Before attempting to descend he had\r\nput off his coat and placed it in the basket. After a deal of trouble we\r\nwere at last all right.\r\n\r\n“As Roziers was without a coat I besought him to go to the nearest\r\nhouse. On his way thither he encountered the Duke of Chartres, who\r\nhad followed us, as we saw, very closely, for I had had the honour of\r\nconversing with him the moment before we set out.”\r\n\r\nThe following report of this first aerial voyage was drawn up by\r\nscientific observers, among other signatures to it being that of\r\nBenjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\n“Today 21st of October, 1783, at the Chateau de la Muette, an experiment\r\nwas made with the aerostatic machine of M. Montgolfier. The sky was\r\nclouded in many parts, clear in others--the wind north-west. At mid-day\r\na signal was given, which announced that the balloon was being filled.\r\nSoon after, in spite of the wind, it was inflated in all its parts, and\r\nthe ascent was made. The Marquis d’Arlandes and M. Pilatre des Roziers\r\nwere in the gallery. The first intention was to raise the machine and\r\npull it back with ropes, to test it, to find out the exact weight which\r\nit could carry, and to see if everything was properly arranged before\r\nthe actual ascent was attempted. But the machine, driven by the wind,\r\nfar from rising vertically, was directed upon one of the walks of\r\na garden, and the cords which held it shook with so much force that\r\nseveral rents were made in the balloon. The machine, being brought back\r\nto its place, was repaired in less than two hours. Being again inflated,\r\nit rose once more, bearing the same persons, and when it had risen\r\nto the height of 250 feet, the intrepid voyagers, bowing their heads,\r\nsaluted the spectators. One could not resist a feeling of mingled fear\r\nand admiration. Soon the aeronauts were lost to view, but the balloon\r\nitself, displaying its very beautiful shape, mounted to the height of\r\n3,000 feet, and still remained visible. The voyagers, satisfied with\r\ntheir experience, and not wishing to make a longer course, agreed to\r\ndescend, but, perceiving that the wind was driving them upon the houses\r\nof the Rue de Sevres, preserved their self-possession, renewed the hot\r\nair, rose anew and continued their course till they had passed Paris.\r\n\r\n“They then descended tranquilly in the country, beyond the new\r\nboulevard, without having experienced the slightest inconvenience,\r\nhaving still the greater part of their fuel untouched. They could, had\r\nthey desired, have cleared a distance three times as great as that which\r\nthey traversed. Their flight was nearly 30,000 feet, and the time it\r\noccupied was from twenty to twenty-five minutes. This machine was 70\r\nfeet high, 46 feet in diameter, and had a capacity of 60,000 cubic\r\nfeet.”\r\n\r\nIt is reported that Franklin, more illustrious in his humility than the\r\nmost brilliant among the lords of the court, when consulted respecting\r\nthe possible use of balloons, answered simply, “C’est l’enfant qui vient\r\nde naitre?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. The Second Arial Voyage.\r\n\r\n(1st December 1783.--Charles and Robert at the Tuileries.)\r\n\r\nThe first ascent of Roziers and Arlandes was a feat of hardihood almost\r\nunique. The men’s courage was, so to speak, their only guarantee. Thanks\r\nto the balloon, however, they accomplished one of the most extraordinary\r\nenterprises ever achieved by our race.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the experiment of the Champ de Mars (27th of August),\r\nProfessor Charles--who had already acquired celebrity at the Louvre, by\r\nhis scientific collection and by his rank as an official instructor--and\r\nthe Brothers Robert, mechanicians, were engaged in the construction of\r\na balloon, to be inflated with hydrogen gas, and destined to carry a car\r\nand one or two passengers. For this ascent Charles may be said to have\r\ncreated all at once the art of aerostation as now practiced, for he\r\nbrought it at one bound to such perfection that since his day scarcely\r\nany advance has been made upon his arrangements. His simple yet complete\r\ninvention was that of the valve which gives escape to the hydrogen gas,\r\nand thus renders the descent of the balloon gentle and gradual; the car\r\nthat carries the travellers; the ballast of sand, by which the ascent is\r\nregulated and the fall is moderated; the coating of caoutchouc, by means\r\nof which the material of the balloon is rendered airtight and prevents\r\nloss of gas; and, finally, the use of the barometer, which marks at\r\nevery instant, by the elevation or the depression of the mercury, the\r\nposition in which the aeronaut finds himself in the atmosphere. Charles\r\ncreated all the contrivances, or, in other words, all the ingenious\r\nprecautions which make up the art of aerostation.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November, the balloon, fitted with its network, and\r\nhaving the car attached to it, was sent away from the hall of the\r\nTuileries, where it had been exhibited. The ascent was fixed for the 1st\r\nof December, 1783, a memorable day for the Parisians.\r\n\r\nAt noon upon that day, the subscribers, who had paid four louis for\r\ntheir seats, took their places within the enclosure outside the circle,\r\nin which stood the casks employed for making the gas. The humbler\r\nsubscribers, at three francs a-head, occupied the rest of the garden.\r\nThe number of spectators, as we read underneath the numerous coloured\r\nprints which represent this spectacle, was 600,000; but though, without\r\ndoubt, the gardens of the Tuileries are very large, it is probable this\r\nfigure is a considerable overstatement, for this number would have been\r\nthree-fourths of the whole population of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe roofs and windows of the houses were crowded, whilst the Pont Royal\r\nand the square of Louis XV. were covered by an immense multitude. About\r\nmid-day a rumour was spread to the effect that the king forbade the\r\nascent. Charles ran to the Chief Minister of State, and plainly told him\r\nthat his life was the king’s, but his honour was his own: his word was\r\npledged to the country and he would ascend. Taking this high ground,\r\nthe bold professor gained an unwilling permission to carry out his\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nA little afterwards the sound of cannon was heard. This was the signal\r\nwhich announced the last arrangements and thus dissipated all doubt as\r\nto the rising of the balloon, There had during the day been considerable\r\ndisturbance among the crowd, between the partisans of Charles and\r\nMontgolfier; each party extolled its hero, and did everything possible\r\nto detract from the merits of the rival inventor. But whatever\r\nill-feeling might have existed was swept away by Professor Charles with\r\na compliment. When he was ready to ascend, he walked up to Montgolfier,\r\nand, with the true instinct of French politeness, presented him with a\r\nlittle balloon, saying at the same time--\r\n\r\n“It is for you, monsieur, to show us the way to the skies.”\r\n\r\nThe exquisite taste and delicacy of this incident touched the bystanders\r\nas with an electric shock, and the place at once rang out with the most\r\ngenuine and hearty applause The little balloon thrown up by Montgolfier\r\nsped away to the north-east, its beautiful emerald colour showing to\r\nfine effect in the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom this point let us follow the narrative of Professor Charles\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“The balloon,” he says, “which escaped from the hands of M. Montgolfier,\r\nrose into the air, and seemed to carry with it the testimony of\r\nfriendship and regard between that gentleman and myself, while\r\nacclamations followed it. Meanwhile, we hastily prepared for departure.\r\nThe stormy weather did not permit us to have at our command all the\r\narrangements which we had contemplated the previous evening; to do so\r\nwould have detained us too long upon the earth. After the balloon and\r\nthe car were in equilibrium, we threw over 19 lbs. of ballast, and we\r\nrose in the midst of silence, arising from the emotion and surprise felt\r\non all sides.\r\n\r\n“Nothing will ever equal that moment of joyous excitement which filled\r\nmy whole being when I felt myself flying away from the earth. It was not\r\nmere pleasure; it was perfect bliss. Escaped from the frightful torments\r\nof persecution and of calumny, I felt that I was answering all in rising\r\nabove all.\r\n\r\n“To this sentiment succeeded one more lively still--the admiration of\r\nthe majestic spectacle that spread itself out before us. On whatever\r\nside we looked, all was glorious; a cloudless sky above, a most\r\ndelicious view around. ‘Oh, my friend,’ said I to M. Robert, ‘how great\r\nis our good fortune! I care not what may be the condition of the earth;\r\nit is the sky that is for me now. What serenity! what a ravishing scene!\r\nWould that I could bring here the last of our detractors, and say to the\r\nwretch, Behold what you would have lost had you arrested the progress of\r\nscience.’\r\n\r\n“Whilst we were rising with a progressively increasing speed, we\r\nwaved our bannerets in token of our cheerfulness, and in order to give\r\nconfidence to those below who took an interest in our fate. M.\r\nRobert made an inventory of our stores; our friends had stocked our\r\ncommissariat as for a long voyage--champagne and other wines, garments\r\nof fur and other articles of clothing.\r\n\r\n“‘Good,’ I said; ‘throw that out of the window.’ He took a blanket and\r\nlaunched it into the air, through which it floated down slowly, and fell\r\nupon the dome of l’Assomption.\r\n\r\n“When the barometer had fallen 26 inches, we ceased to ascend. We were\r\nup at an elevation of 1,800 feet. This was the height to which I had\r\npromised myself to ascend; and, in fact, from this moment to the time\r\nwhen we disappeared from the eyes of our friends, we always kept a\r\nhorizontal course, the barometer registering 26 inches to 26 inches 8\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n“We required to throw over ballast in proportion as the almost\r\ninsensible escape of the hydrogen gas caused us to descend, in order to\r\nremain as nearly as possible at the same elevation. If circumstances had\r\npermitted us to measure the amount of ballast we threw over, our course\r\nwould have been almost absolutely horizontal.\r\n\r\n“After remaining for a few moments stationary, our car I changed its\r\ncourse, and we were carried on at the will of the wind. Soon we passed\r\nthe Seine, between St. Ouen and Asnieres. We traversed the river a\r\nsecond time, leaving Argenteuil upon the left. We passed Sannois,\r\nFranconville, Eau-Bonne, St. Leu-Taverny, Villiers, and finally, Nesles.\r\nThis was about twenty-seven miles from Paris, and we had I reached this\r\ndistance in two hours, although there was so little wind that the air\r\nscarcely stirred.\r\n\r\n“During the whole course of this delightful voyage, not the slightest\r\napprehension for our fate or that of our machine entered my head for a\r\nmoment. The globe did not suffer any alteration beyond the successive\r\nchanges of dilatation and compression, which enabled us to mount and\r\ndescend at will. The thermometer was, during more than an hour, between\r\nten and twelve degrees above zero; this being to some extent accounted\r\nfor by the fact that the interior of the car was warmed by the rays of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n“At the end of fifty-six minutes, we heard the report of the cannon\r\nwhich informed us that we had, at that moment, disappeared from view at\r\nParis. We rejoiced that we had escaped, as we were no longer obliged\r\nto observe a horizontal course, and to regulate the balloon for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n“We gave ourselves up to the contemplation of the views which the\r\nimmense stretch of country beneath us presented. From that time, though\r\nwe had no opportunity of conversing with the inhabitants, we saw\r\nthem running after us from all parts; we heard their cries, their\r\nexclamations of solicitude, and knew their alarm and admiration.\r\n\r\n“We cried, ‘Vive le Roi!’ and the people responded. We heard, very\r\ndistinctly--‘My good friends, have you no fear? Are you not sick? How\r\nbeautiful it is! Heaven preserve you! Adieu, my friends.’\r\n\r\n“I was touched to tears by this tender and true interest which our\r\nappearance had called forth.\r\n\r\n“We continued to wave our flags without cessation, and we perceived\r\nthat these signals greatly increased the cheerfulness and calmed the\r\nsolicitude of the people below. Often we descended sufficiently low to\r\nhear what they shouted to us. They asked us where we came from, and at\r\nwhat hour we had started.\r\n\r\n“We threw over successively frock-coats, muffs, and habits. Sailing on\r\nabove the Ile d’Adam, after having admired the splendid view, we made\r\nsignals with our flags, and demanded news of the Prince of Conti. One\r\ncried up to us, in a very powerful voice, that he was at Paris, and\r\nthat he was ill. We regretted missing such an opportunity of paying our\r\nrespects, for we could have descended into the prince’s gardens, if we\r\nhad wished, but we preferred to pursue our course, and we re-ascended.\r\nFinally, we arrived at the plain of Nesles.\r\n\r\n“We saw from the distance groups of peasants, who ran on before us\r\nacross the fields. ‘Let us go,’ I said, and we descended towards a vast\r\nmeadow.\r\n\r\n“Some shrubs and trees stood round its border. Our car advanced\r\nmajestically in a long inclined plane. On arriving near the trees, I\r\nfeared that their branches might damage the car, so I threw over two\r\npounds of ballast, and we rose again. We ran along more than 120 feet,\r\nat a distance of one or two feet from the ground, and had the appearance\r\nof travelling in a sledge. The peasants ran after us without being able\r\nto catch us, like children pursuing a butterfly in the fields.\r\n\r\n“Finally, we stopped, and were instantly surrounded. Nothing could equal\r\nthe simple and tender regard of the country people, their admiration,\r\nand their lively emotion.\r\n\r\n“I called at once for the cures and the magistrates. They came round\r\nme on all sides: there was quite a fete on the spot. I prepared a short\r\nreport, which the cures and the syndics signed. Then arrived a company\r\nof horsemen at a gallop. These were the Duke of Chartres, the Duke of\r\nFitzjames, and M. Farrer. By a very singular chance, we had come down\r\nclose by the hunting-lodge of the latter. He leaped from his horse and\r\nthrew himself into my arms, crying, ‘Monsieur Charles, I was first!’\r\n\r\n“Charles adds that they were covered with the caresses of the prince,\r\nwho embraced both of them. He briefly narrated to the Duke of Chartres\r\nsome incidents of the voyage.\r\n\r\n“‘But this is not all, monseigneur. I am going away again,’ added\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\n“‘What! Going away!’ exclaimed the duke.\r\n\r\n“‘Monseigneur, you will see. When do you wish me to come back again?’ I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“‘In half an hour.’\r\n\r\n“‘Very well: be it so. In half an hour I shall be with you again.’\r\n\r\n“M. Robert descended from the car, and I was alone in the balloon.\r\n\r\n“I said to the duke, ‘Monseigneur, I go.’ I said to the peasants who\r\nheld down the balloon, ‘My friends, go away, all of you, from the car\r\nat the moment I give the signal.’ I then rose like a bird, and in\r\nten minutes I was more than 3,000 feet above the ground. I no longer\r\nperceived terrestrial objects; I only saw the great masses of nature.\r\n\r\n“In going away, Charles had taken his precautions against the possible\r\nexplosion of the balloon, and made himself ready to make certain\r\nobservations. In order to observe the barometer and the thermometer,\r\nplaced at different extremities of the car, without endangering the\r\nequilibrium, he sat down in the middle, a watch and paper in his left\r\nhand, a pen and the cord of the safety-valve in his right.\r\n\r\n“I waited for what should happen,” continues he. “The balloon, which\r\nwas quite flabby and soft when I ascended, was now taut, and fully\r\ndistended. Soon the hydrogen gas began to escape in considerable\r\nquantities by the neck of the balloon, and then, from time to time, I\r\npulled open the valve to give it two issues at once; and I continued\r\nthus to mount upwards, all the time losing the inflammable air, which,\r\nrushing past me from the neck of the balloon, felt like a warm cloud.\r\n\r\n“I passed in ten minutes from the temperature of spring to that of\r\nwinter; the cold was keen and dry, but not insupportable. I examined all\r\nmy sensations calmly; _I_ COULD HEAR MYSELF LIVE, so to speak, and I am\r\ncertain that at first I experienced nothing disagreeable in this sudden\r\npassage from one temperature to another.\r\n\r\n“When the barometer ceased to move I noted very exactly eighteen inches\r\nten lines. This observation is perfectly accurate The mercury did not\r\nsuffer any sensible movement.\r\n\r\n“At the end of some minutes the cold caught my fingers; I could hardly\r\nhold the pen, but I no longer had need to do so. I was stationary, or\r\nrather moved only in a horizontal direction.\r\n\r\n“I raised myself in the middle of the car, and abandoned myself to the\r\nspectacle before me. At my departure from the meadow the sun had sunk to\r\nthe people of the valleys; soon he shone for me alone, and came again to\r\npour his rays upon the balloon and the car. I was the only creature in\r\nthe horizon in sunshine--all the rest of nature was in shade. Ere long,\r\nhowever, the sun disappeared, and thus I had the pleasure of seeing him\r\nset twice in the same day. I contemplated for some moments the mists and\r\nvapours that rose from the valley and the rivers The clouds seemed to\r\ncome forth from the earth, and to accumulate the one upon the other.\r\nTheir colour was a monotonous grey--a natural effect, for there was no\r\nlight save that of the moon.\r\n\r\n“I observed that I had tacked round twice, and I felt currents which\r\ncalled me to my senses. I found with surprise the effect of the wind,\r\nand saw the cloth of my flag: extended horizontally.\r\n\r\n“In the midst of the inexpressible pleasure of this state of ecstatic\r\ncontemplation, I was recalled to myself by a most extraordinary pain\r\nwhich I felt in the interior of the ears and in the maxillary glands.\r\nThis I attributed to the dilation of the air contained in the cellular\r\ntissue of the organ as much as to the cold outside. I was in my vest,\r\nwith my head uncovered. I immediately covered my head with a bonnet of\r\nwool which was at my feet, but the pain only disappeared with my descent\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\n“It was now seven or eight minutes since I had arrived at this\r\nelevation, and I now commenced to descend. I remembered the promise I\r\nhad made to the Duke of Chartres, to return in half an hour. I quickened\r\nmy descent by opening the valve from time to time. Soon the balloon,\r\nempty now to one half, presented the appearance of a hemisphere.\r\n\r\n“Arrived at twenty-three fathoms from the earth, I suddenly threw over\r\ntwo or three pounds of ballast, which arrested my descent, and which I\r\nhad carefully kept for this purpose. I then slowly descended upon the\r\nground, which I had, so to speak, chosen.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the narrative of the second aerial voyage. After such a\r\nmemorable ascent one is astonished to learn that Professor Charles never\r\nrepeated his experiment. It has been said that, in descending from\r\nhis car, he had vowed that he would never again expose himself to such\r\nperils, so strong had been the alarm he felt when the peasants ceasing\r\nto hold him down he shot up into the sky with the rapidity of an arrow.\r\nBut after him a thousand others have followed the daring example he set.\r\nWith this ascent the memorable year 1783 closed, and the seed which had\r\nbeen sown soon began to be productive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The History of Aerostation from the Year 1783.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Open Route--Travels and Travellers--Great Increase in\r\n     the Number of Air Voyages--Lyons, Ascent of “Le Flesselles--\r\n     Milan, Ascent of Adriani--Flight of a Balloon from London--\r\n     Lost Balloons in the Chief Towns of Europe\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1783, in which aerostation had its birth, and in which\r\nit was carried to a degree of perfection, beside which the progress\r\nof aeronauts in our days seems small, a new route was opened up for\r\ntravellers. The science of Montgolfier, the practical art of Professor\r\nCharles, and the courage of Roziers, subdued the scepticism of those who\r\nhad not yet given in their adhesion to the possible value of the great\r\ndiscovery, and throughout the whole of France a feverish degree of\r\nenthusiasm in the art manifested itself Aerial excursions now became\r\nquite fashionable. Let it be understood that we do not here refer to\r\nascents in fixed balloons, that is, in balloons which were attached to\r\nthe earth by means of ropes more or less long.\r\n\r\nM. Biot narrates that, in his young days, when aeronautic ascents were\r\nless known than they are in these times, there was in the plain of\r\nGrenelle, at the mill of Javelle, an establishment where balloons were\r\nconstantly maintained for the accommodation of amateurs of both sexes\r\nwho wished to make ascents in what were called “ballons captifs,” or\r\nballoons anchored, so to speak, to the earth by means of long ropes They\r\nwere for a considerable time the rage of fashionable society, and it is\r\nnot recorded that any accidents resulted from the practice. Of course\r\nit may be easily understood with these safe balloons the adventurous\r\naeronauts never ascended to any great height. The reader will find this\r\nsubject treated under the chapter of military aerostation.\r\n\r\nWe are at present specially engaged with the narrative of the first\r\nattempts in aerostation--the first experiments in the new discovery.\r\nWe have followed with interest the exciting details of the first\r\nadventurous ascents, in which the genius of man first essayed the\r\nunexplored paths of the heavens. Yet a continued record of aerial\r\nvoyages would not be of the same interest. The results of subsequent\r\nexpeditions, and the impressions of subsequent aeronauts are the same\r\nas those already described, or differ from them only in minor points. No\r\nimportant advance is recorded in the art. We shall therefore endeavour\r\nnot to confine ourselves to the narrative of a dry and monotonous\r\nchronology, but to select from the number of ascents that have taken\r\nplace within the last eighty years, only those whose special character\r\nrenders them worthy of more detailed and severe investigation.\r\n\r\nIn order to give an idea of the rapid multiplication of aeronautic\r\nexperiments, it will suffice to state that the only aeronauts of\r\n1783 are Roziers, the Marquis d’Arlandes, Professor Charles, his\r\ncollaborateur the younger Robert, and a carpenter, named Wilcox, who\r\nmade ascents at Philadelphia and London.\r\n\r\nA number of balloons were remarkable for the beauty and elegance which\r\nwe have already spoken of. Among the most beautiful we may mention the\r\n“Flesselles” balloon and Bagnolet’s balloon.\r\n\r\nOf the ascents which immediately succeeded those that have been treated\r\nin the first part of our volume, and which are the most memorable in\r\nthe early annals of aerostation, that of the 17th of January, 1784, is\r\nremarkable. It took place at Lyons. Seven persons went into the car on\r\nthis occasion--Joseph Montgolfier, Roziers, the Comte de Laurencin, the\r\nComte de Dampierre, the Prince Charles de Ligne, the Comte de Laporte\r\nd’Anglifort, and Fontaine, who threw himself into the car when it had\r\nalready begun to move.\r\n\r\nA most minute account of this experiment is given in a letter of Mathon\r\nde la Cour, director of the Academy of Sciences at Lyons:--“After the\r\nexperiments of the Champ de Mars and Versailles had become known,”\r\n he says, “the citizens of this town proposed to repeat them and a\r\nsubscription was opened for this purpose. On the arrival of the elder\r\nMontgolfier, about the end of September, M. de Flesselles, our director,\r\nalways zealous in promoting whatever might be for the welfare of the\r\nprovince and the advancement of science and art, persuaded him to\r\norganise the subscription. The aim of the experiment proposed by\r\nMontgolfier was not the ascent of any human being in the balloon. The\r\nprospectus only announced that a balloon of a much larger size than any\r\nthat had been made would ascend--that it would rise to several thousand\r\nfeet, and that, including the animals that it was proposed it should\r\ncarry, it would weigh 8,000 lbs. The subscription was fixed at L12, and\r\nthe number of subscribers was 360.”\r\n\r\nIt was on these conditions that Montgolfier commenced his balloon of 126\r\nfeet high and 100 feet in diameter, made of a double envelope of cotton\r\ncloth, with a lining of paper between. A strength and consistency was\r\ngiven to the structure by means of ribbons and cords.\r\n\r\nThe work was nearly finished when Roziers went up in his fire-balloon\r\nfrom La Muette. Immediately the Comte de Laurencin pressed Montgolfier\r\nto allow him to go up in the new machine. Montgolfier was only too glad\r\nof the opportunity--refused up to this time by the king--of going up\r\nhimself. From thirty to forty people made application to go with the\r\naeronauts; and on the 26th of December, 1678, Roziers, the Comte de\r\nDampierre, and the Comte de Laporte, arrived in Lyons with the same\r\nintention. Prince Charles also arrived; and as his father had taken one\r\nhundred subscriptions, his claim to go up could not be refused.\r\n\r\nBut while the public papers were full of ascents at Avignon, Marseilles,\r\nand Paris, it is impossible to describe the vexation of Roziers, when\r\nhe discovered that Montgolfier’s new balloon was not intended to carry\r\npassengers, and had not been, from the first, constructed with that\r\nview. He suggested a number of alterations, which Montgolfier adopted at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January, 1784, all the pieces of which the balloon was\r\ncomposed were carried out to the field called Les Brotteaux, outside the\r\ntown, from which the ascent was to be made. This event was announced to\r\ntake place on the 10th and at five o’clock on the morning of that day;\r\nbut unexpected delays occurred, and in the necessary operations the\r\ncovering was torn in many places.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th the balloon was inflated in seventeen minutes, and the\r\ngallery was attached in an hour--the fire from which the heated air was\r\nobtained requiring to be fed at the rate of 5 lbs. of alder-wood per\r\nminute; but the preparations had occupied so much time, that it was\r\nfound, when everything was complete, that the afternoon was too far\r\nadvanced for the ascent to be made. This machine was destined to suffer\r\nfrom endless misfortunes. It took fire while being inflated, and,\r\nseveral days afterwards, it was damaged by snow and rain. Put nothing\r\ndiscouraged Roziers and his companions. Places had been arranged in the\r\ngallery for six persons. After the balloon was at last inflated,\r\nPrince Charles and the Comes de Laurencin, Dampierre, and Laporte threw\r\nthemselves into the gallery. They were all armed, and were determined\r\nnot to quit their places to whoever might come. Roziers, who wished at\r\nthe last to enjoy a high ascent, proposed to reduce the number to three,\r\nand to draw lots for the purpose. But the gentlemen would not descend.\r\nThe debate became animated. The four voyagers cried to cut the ropes.\r\nThe director of the Academy, to whom application was made in this\r\nemergency, admiring the resolution and the courage of the four\r\ngentlemen, wished to satisfy them in their desire. Accordingly the ropes\r\nwere cut; but at that moment M. Montgolfier and Roziers threw themselves\r\ninto the gallery. At the same time a certain M. Fontaine, who had\r\nhad much to do in the construction of the machine, threw himself in,\r\nalthough it had not previously been arranged that he should be of the\r\nparty. His boldness in jumping in was pardoned, on the ground of his\r\nservices and his zeal.\r\n\r\nIn going away the machine turned to the south-west, and bent a little.\r\nA rope which dragged along the ground seemed to retard its ascent; but\r\nsome intelligent person having cut this with a hatchet, it began to\r\nright itself and ascend. At a certain height it turned to the north\r\neast. The wind was feeble, and the progress was slow, but the imposing\r\neffect was indescribable. The immense machine rose into the air as by\r\nsome effect of magic. Nearly 100,000 spectators were present, and they\r\nwere greatly excited at the view. They clapped their hands and stretched\r\ntheir arms towards the sky; women fainted away, or (for some reasons\r\nbest known to themselves) found relief for their excitement in tears;\r\nwhile the men, uttering cries of joy, waved their handkerchiefs, and\r\nthrew their hats into the air.\r\n\r\nThe form of the machine was that of a globe, rising from a reversed and\r\ntruncated cone, to which the gallery was attached. The upper part was\r\nwhite, the lower part grey; and the cone was composed of strips of stuff\r\nof different colours. On the sides of the balloon were two paintings,\r\none of which represented History, the other Fame. The flag bore the arms\r\nof the director of the Academy, and above it were inscribed the words\r\n“Le Flesselles.”\r\n\r\nThe voyagers observed that they did not consume a fourth of the quantity\r\nof combustibles after they had risen into the air, which they consumed\r\nwhen attached to the earth. They were in the gayest humour, and they\r\ncalculated that the fuel they had would keep them floating till late\r\nin the evening. Unfortunately, however, after throwing more wood on the\r\nfire, in order to get up to a greater altitude, it was discovered that\r\na rent had been made in the covering, caused by the fire by which the\r\nballoon had been damaged two or three days previously. The rent was four\r\nfeet in length; and as the heated air escaped very rapidly by it, the\r\nballoon fell, after having sailed above the earth for barely fifteen\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe descent only occupied two or three minutes, and yet the shock was\r\nsupportable. It was observed that as soon as the machine had touched the\r\nearth all the cloth became unfolded in a few seconds, which seemed to\r\nconfirm the opinion of Montgolfier, who believed that electricity had\r\nmuch to do in the ascent of balloons. The voyagers were got out of the\r\nballoon without accident, and were greeted with the most enthusiastic\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the ascent, the opera of “Iphigenia in Aulis” was given,\r\nand the theatre was thronged by a vast assemblage, attracted thither\r\nin the hope of seeing the illustrious experimentalists. The curtain had\r\nrisen when M. and Madame de Flesselles entered their box, accompanied\r\nby Montgolfier and Roziers. At sight of them the enthusiasm of the house\r\nrose to fever pitch. The other voyagers also entered, and were greeted\r\nwith the same demonstrations. Cries arose from the pit to begin the\r\nopera again, in honour of the visitors. The curtain then fell, and when\r\nit again rose, after a few moments, the actor who filled the role of\r\nAgamemnon advanced with crowns, which he handed to Madame de Flesselles,\r\nwho distributed them to the aeronauts. Roziers placed the crown that had\r\nbeen given to him upon Montgolfier’s head.\r\n\r\nWhen the actress who played the part of Clytemnestra, sung the passage\r\nbeginning--\r\n\r\n“I love to see these flattering honours paid.”\r\n\r\nThe audience at once applied her song to the circumstances, and\r\nre-demanded it, which request the actress complied with, addressing\r\nherself to the box in which the distinguished visitors sat. The\r\ndemonstrations of admiration were continued after the opera was over;\r\nand during the whole of the night the gentlemen of the balloon ascent\r\nwere serenaded.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards, Roziers having appeared at a ball, received further\r\nproofs of admiration and honours; and when, on the 22nd of January, he\r\ndeparted for Dijon on his return to Paris, he was accompanied as in a\r\ntriumph by a numerous cavalcade of the most distinguished young men of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, at Paris, much discontent with the ascent of\r\n“Le Flesselles;” and the Journal de Paris de Paris, which notices so\r\nenthusiastically the other ascents of that epoch, speaks slightingly of\r\nthat at Lyons.\r\n\r\nThe next great ascent took place at Milan, on the 25th of February,\r\n1784, under the direction of the Chevalier Paul Andriani, who had a\r\nballoon constructed by the Brothers Gerli, at his own expense. We read\r\nthat this balloon was 66 feet in diameter, and that the envelope was\r\ncomposed of cloth, lined in the interior with fine paper.\r\n\r\nThe balloon was not in all respects constructed like that which rose at\r\nLyons. The grating which supported the fire that kept up the supply of\r\nhot air was placed at the mouth of the opening. It was made of copper,\r\nwas six feet in diameter, and was secured by a number of transverse\r\nbeams of wood. M. Andriani thought it best to place his fire--contrary\r\nto general usage--a little way above the mouth of the opening, and he\r\nfound out that the activity of the fire was in proportion with that of\r\nthe air which entered and fed it.\r\n\r\nIn place of making use of a gallery like that employed by Montgolfier,\r\nas much to manage the fire as to carry the traveller and the fuel, he\r\nsubstituted a wide basket, suspended by cords to the edge of the opening\r\nof the balloon, at such a distance that fuel could be thrown on with the\r\nhand without being inconvenienced by the heat.\r\n\r\nEverything being in readiness, the machine was carried to Moncuco, the\r\nsplendid domain of Andriani, where the first experiments were made; for\r\nthis gentlemen knew that as the populace are impatient, they are also\r\noften un-reasonable, and jump to the hastiest and most inconsiderate\r\nconclusion when, in witnessing scientific experiments, any of the\r\narrangements happen to be imperfect, and the results in any respect\r\nprove unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAndriani did not deceive himself, for, sure enough, his first attempt\r\ndid not come up to expectation. The reasons for this failure were the\r\ntoo great quantity of air which the fire drew in, and the unsuitable\r\ncharacter of the fuel used.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of February, 1784, a second attempt was made. The fire was\r\nlighted under the machine, at first with dry birch-wood and afterwards\r\nwith a bituminous composition, ingeniously concocted by one of the\r\nBrothers Gerli. In less than four minutes the balloon was completely\r\ninflated, and the men employed to hold it down with ropes perceived that\r\nit was on the point of rising. The aeronauts then gave the order to\r\nlet go. Scarcely was the balloon let off, when it gently rose a short\r\ndistance, and then flew in a horizontal direction towards a palace in\r\nthe neighbourhood. In order that the structure should not be destroyed\r\non the walls and the roof of the palace, the voyagers heaped on the\r\nfuel, and the spectators, who had gathered together from the surrounding\r\nvillages, then saw this strange vessel of the air rising with rapidity\r\nto a surprising height. Such a phenomenon was so astonishing, that those\r\nwho beheld it could hardly believe their own eyes; and when the balloon\r\ndisappeared from view, the delight they had manifested was dashed with\r\nfear for the fate of the bold aeronauts. The latter, seeing that the\r\nballoon was driving through the air towards a range of rocky hills in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and perceiving, on the other hand, that their stock\r\nof combustibles was nearly exhausted, judged it prudent to descend. They\r\ndiminished their fire, and came gradually down, warning the multitude\r\nbelow of their intention by means of a speaking-trumpet.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the descent the balloon alighted upon a large tree, to\r\nthe great peril of the travellers; but as soon as the fire was increased\r\nit again mounted and got clear from the branches while the people below,\r\ngrasping the cords that were hung out to them, guided the machine to the\r\nspot which the voyagers indicated. To descend to terra firma was then\r\na comparatively easy matter, and it was safely accomplished. The fire,\r\nwhich in the case of the French balloons had dried, calcined, and almost\r\nconsumed the upper part of the balloon, had no evil effect upon that of\r\nAndriani, which came down looking as fresh as if it had never been used.\r\n\r\nThe new idea had now passed the frontiers of France, in which it was\r\noriginally conceived, and among the other nations, as at first in\r\nFrance, the power of the inflated balloon came to be tested everywhere\r\nby the construction of small toy globes.\r\n\r\nIt was just about five months after the first experiment at\r\nAnnonay--viz., on the 25th of November, 1783--that the first balloon\r\nascended in London. We are informed, in the History of Aerostation by\r\nTiberius Cavallo, that an Italian, Count Zambeccari, who was staying in\r\nthe English capital, made a balloon of silk, covered with a varnish of\r\noil. Its diameter was ten feet, and its weight eleven pounds. It was\r\ngilded for the double purpose of enhancing its appearance and preventing\r\nthe escape of air. After having been exposed to public inspection for\r\nseveral days, it was filled three parts full of hydrogen gas, a tin\r\nbottle was suspended from it, containing an address to whoever might\r\nfind it when it should fall, and it was let off from the Artillery\r\nGround, in presence of a vast assembly.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of December, 1783, a little balloon, made of gold-beaters’\r\nskin, was let off publicly at Turin. This was an experiment similar to\r\nthat which had been tried at Paris in September. The balloon was seen\r\nto penetrate the clouds, then to mount still higher, and finally to\r\ndisappear entirely in five minutes fifty-four seconds from the time when\r\nit was set free.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, after the experiments made long before with electric\r\npaper kites, to employ the balloon in the investigation of the electric\r\nconditions of the atmosphere. The first to use it for this purpose was\r\nthe Abbe Berthelon de Montpellier. He sent up a number of balloons, to\r\nwhich he had attached pieces of metal, long and narrow, and terminating\r\nin a cylinder of glass, or other substance suitable for the purpose\r\nof isolation, and he obtained sufficient electricity by these means\r\nto demonstrate the phenomena of attraction and repulsion, as well as\r\nelectric sparks.\r\n\r\nCavallo mentions an accident which took place in England about this\r\ntime, and which served as a warning to all who had to do with balloons\r\nfilled with hydrogen gas. A balloon thus inflated had been sent up\r\nat Hopton, near Matlock, and was found by two men near Cheadle, in\r\nStaffordshire. These ingenious persons carried it within doors, and\r\nhaving wished to fully inflate it--half the gas having by this time\r\nescaped--they applied a pair of bellows to its mouth. By this means they\r\nonly forced out the volume of the hydrogen gas that was left; and this\r\ngas, coming in contact with a candle that had been placed too near,\r\nexploded. The report was louder than that of a cannon, and so powerful\r\nwas the shock that the men were thrown down, the glass blown out of the\r\nwindows, and the house otherwise damaged. The men suffered severely,\r\ntheir hair, beards, and eyebrows being completely burnt away, and their\r\nfaces severely scorched.\r\n\r\nAt Grenoble, in Dauphine, De Baron let off a balloon on the 13th of\r\nJanuary, 1784. It rose, and at first took a northern direction;\r\nbut, having encountered a current of air, it was carried away in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction, and after flying a distance of three-quarters\r\nof a mile, it fell, having traversed this distance in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nA society, under the presidency of the Abbe de Mably, having constructed\r\na balloon thirty-seven feet high and twenty feet in diameter, sent it\r\noff from the court of the Castle of Pisancon, near Romano, on the same\r\nday, the 13th of February. At first it was carried to the south by\r\na strong north wind, but after it had risen to 1,000 feet above the\r\nsurface, its course was changed towards the north. It was calculated\r\nthat, in less than five minutes, this balloon rose to the height of\r\n6,000 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of the same month the Count d’Albon threw off from his\r\ngardens at Franconville a balloon inflated with gas, and made of silk,\r\nrendered air-tight by a solution of gum-arabic. It was oblong, and\r\nmeasured twenty-five feet in height, and seventeen feet in diameter.\r\nTo this balloon a cage, containing two guinea-pigs and a rabbit,\r\nwas suspended. The cords were cut, and the inflated globe rose to an\r\nenormous height with the greatest rapidity. Five days afterwards it was\r\nfound at the distance of eighteen miles, and it is remarkable that, in\r\nspite of the cold of the season, and particularly of the elevated region\r\nthrough which the balloon had been passing, the animals were not only\r\nliving, but in good condition.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of February, 1784, the Marquis de Bullion sent up a paper\r\nballoon, of about fifteen feet in diameter. A flat sponge, about a foot\r\nsquare, placed in a tin dish and drenched with a pint of spirits of\r\nwine, was the only apparatus made use of to create a supply of heated\r\nair. It rose at Paris, and three hours afterwards it was found near\r\nBasville, about thirty miles from the capital.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of the same month Cellard de Chastelais sent up a paper\r\nballoon. Heated air was supplied on this occasion by a paper roll,\r\nenclosing a sponge, and soaked in oil, spirits of wine, and grease.\r\nA cage, which contained a cat, was attached to this air globe. In\r\nthirty-five minutes it had mounted so high that it looked but like the\r\nsmallest star, and in two hours it had flown a distance of forty-six\r\nmiles from the place where it was thrown off. The cat was dead, but it\r\nwas not discovered from what cause.\r\n\r\nThe first balloon that traversed the English channel was sent off at\r\nSandwich, in Kent, on the 22nd of February, 1784. It was five feet in\r\ndiameter, and was inflated with hydrogen gas. It rose rapidly, and was\r\ncarried toward France by a north-west wind. Two hours and a half after\r\nit had been let off it was found in a field about nine miles from Lille.\r\nThe balloon carried a letter, instructing the finder of the balloon to\r\ncommunicate with William Boys, Esq., Sandwich, and to state where and at\r\nwhat time it was found. This request was complied with.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February a similar balloon, five feet in diameter, was\r\nsent up from Queen’s College, Oxford. It was spherical, and was made of\r\nPersian silk, coated with varnish. It was the first balloon sent up from\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nDe Saussure makes mention, in a letter dated from Geneva, the 26th\r\nof March, 1784, of certain experiments made in that town with the\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere by means of fixed balloons--i.e., balloons\r\nattached to the earth by ropes, which gave forth sparks and positive\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nMention is also made of a certain M. Argand, of Geneva, who had the\r\nhonour of making balloon experiments at Windsor in the presence of King\r\nGeorge III., Queen Charlotte, and the royal family. About this time\r\n(1784) balloons became “the fashion,” and frequent instances occur of\r\ntheir being raised by day and night, by means of spirit-lamps, to the\r\ngreat delight of multitudes of spectators.\r\n\r\nA letter from Watt to Dr. Lind, of Windsor, dated from Birmingham, 25th\r\nDecember, 1784, narrates an experiment made the summer preceding with\r\na balloon inflated with hydrogen. The balloon was made of fine paper\r\ncovered with a varnish of oil and filled two-thirds with hydrogen gas,\r\nand one-third common air. To the neck of the balloon was attached a sort\r\nof squib two feet long, the fuse of which was ignited when the balloon\r\nwas inflated. The night was calm and dark, and a great multitude was\r\nassembled to witness the ascent, which was accomplished with a success\r\nthat gave delight to all; for, at the end of six minutes the fuse\r\ncommunicated with the squib, and the explosion was like the sound of\r\nthunder. The men who saw it from a distance, but were not present at\r\nits ascent, took it for a meteor. “Our intention,” says Watt, “was, if\r\npossible, to discover whether the reverberating sound of thunder was\r\ndue to echoes or to successive explosions. The sound occasioned by the\r\ndetonation of the hydrogen gas of the balloon in this experiment, does\r\nnot enable us to form a definite judgment; all that we can do is to\r\nrefer to those who were near the balloon, and-who affirm that the sound\r\nwas like that of thunder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. Experiments and Studies--Blanchard at Paris--Guyton de\r\nMorveau at Dijon.\r\n\r\nThe most popular name in aerostation during the Revolution and the\r\nConsulate in France is, without doubt, that of Blanchard. We have\r\nalready referred to him in the chapter which treats of experiments made\r\nprior to the discovery of Montgolfier, and we now have to speak of his\r\nfamous ascent from the Champ de Mars, on the 2nd of March 1784, and of\r\nthe ascents which followed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that he constructed a sort of flying boat, a machine\r\nfurnished with oars and rigging, with which he managed to sustain\r\nhimself some moments in the air at the height of eighty feet. This\r\ncurious machine was exhibited in 1782 in the gardens of the great\r\nhotel of the Rue Taranne. But a little time afterwards Montgolfier’s\r\ndiscoveries quite altered the conditions under which the aerostatic art\r\nwas to be pursued. It had no sooner become known than it became public\r\nproperty. The idea was too simple in its grandeur, and was of too easy\r\na kind not to call up a host of imitators. Of these Blanchard was one\r\nof the first; but this mechanician was anxious to incorporate his own\r\ninvention with that of Montgolfier, and he arranged that on the 2nd\r\nof March, 1784, he should make an ascent in what he still called his\r\n“flying vessel,” which he furnished with four wings.\r\n\r\nBlanchard and his companion, Pesch, a Benedictine priest, were prevented\r\nfrom going up in the balloon, as represented in our illustration, which\r\nwas drawn before the event it was intended to commemorate. A certain\r\nDupont de Chambon persisted in accompanying the voyagers. Pushed back by\r\nthem, he drew his sword, leaped into the car or boat, wounded Blanchard,\r\ncut the rigging, and broke the oars or wings. The aeronaut was\r\nconsequently compelled to have his machine partly re-fitted in great\r\nhaste, and in the course of a few hours he made the ascent alone in the\r\nusual way. Blanchard should have known the uselessness of oars, though\r\nhe did not abandon their employment in subsequent ascents. The Brothers\r\nMontgolfier had dreamed of the employment of oars as a means of\r\nguidance, but had ultimately rejected the idea. Joseph wrote to his\r\nbrother Etienne, about the end of the year 1783:\r\n\r\n“For my sake, my good friend, reflect; calculate well before you employ\r\noars. Oars must either be great or small; if great, they will be heavy;\r\nif small, it will be necessary to move them with great rapidity. I\r\nknow no sufficient means of guidance, except in the knowledge of the\r\ndifferent currents of air, of which it is necessary to make a study; and\r\nthese are generally regulated by the elevation.” The two brothers often\r\nrecurred to this idea.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of the first ascent of Blanchard from the Champ de Mars on\r\nthe 2nd of March, 1784, in the presence of a vast multitude, show us the\r\noars and the mechanism of his flying-machine fitted to a balloon. The\r\ndesign which we here give seems to us deserving of being considered only\r\nas one of the caricatures of the time, especially when we look at\r\nthe personage dressed in the fool’s head-gear, who sits behind and\r\naccompanies the triumphant ascent of the aeronaut with music.\r\n\r\nIt was not with this apparatus that Blanchard effected his ascent, for\r\nwe have seen that the gearing of his vessel was broken by the infuriated\r\nDupont de Chambon. Yet the aeronaut pretends to have been, to some\r\nextent, assisted by his mechanical contrivances. The following is his\r\nnarrative:--\r\n\r\n“I rose to a certain height over Plassy, and perceiving Villette,\r\nwhich I did not despair of reaching in spite of the misfortune that had\r\nhappened to me, I attached a rope of my rigging to my leg, not being\r\nable to make use of my left hand, which I had wrapped in my handkerchief\r\non account of the sword-wound it had received. I fixed up a piece of\r\ncloth, and thus made a sort of sail with which I hugged the wind. But\r\nthe rays of the sun had so heated and rarefied the inflammable air\r\nthat soon I forgot my rigging in thinking of the terrible danger that\r\nthreatened me.”\r\n\r\nGoing on to narrate the dangers that beset him, Blanchard describes a\r\nnumber of most extraordinary experiences, which would be better worthy\r\nof a place here if they were more like the truth. His curious narrative\r\nis thus brought to a close:--\r\n\r\n“Escaped from these impetuous and contrary winds, during which I had\r\nfelt a great degree of cold, I mounted perpendicularly. The cold became\r\nexcessive. Being hungry I ate a morsel of cake. I wished to drink, but\r\nin searching the car nothing was to be seen but the debris of bottles\r\nand glasses, which my assailant had left behind him when we were about\r\nto depart. Afterwards all was so calm that nothing could be seen or\r\nheard. The silence became appalling, and to add to my alarm I began to\r\nlose consciousness. I now wished to take snuff, but found I had left my\r\nbox behind me. I changed my seat many times; I went from prow to stern,\r\nbut the drowsiness only ceased to assail me when I was struck by two\r\nfurious winds, which compressed my balloon to such an extent that its\r\nsize became sensibly diminished to the eye. I was not sorry when I began\r\nto descend rapidly upon the river, which at first seemed to me a white\r\nthread, afterwards a ribbon, and then a piece of cloth. As I followed\r\nthe course of the river, the fear that I should have to descend into\r\nit, made me agitate the oars very rapidly. I believe that it is to these\r\nmovements that I owe my being able to cross the river transversely, and\r\nget above dry land. When I saw myself upon the plain of Billancourt, I\r\nrecognised the bridge of Sevres, and the road to Versailles. I was then\r\nabout as high as the towers above the plain, and I could hear the words\r\nand the cries of joy of the people who were following me below. At\r\nlength I came to a plain about 200 feet in extent. The people then\r\nassisted me and brought my vessel to anchor. Immediately I was\r\nsurrounded by gentlemen and foot passengers who had run together from\r\nall parts.”\r\n\r\nThis voyage lasted one hour and a quarter. The most important incident\r\nof it was that the balloon was very nearly burst by the expansion of the\r\nhydrogen gas. No balloon, as we have already seen, should be entirely\r\ninflated at the beginning of a journey. Blanchard had a narrow escape\r\nfrom being the victim of his ignorance of physics, and it is a wonder\r\nhe was not left to the mercy of fate in a burst balloon, at several\r\nthousand feet above the earth.\r\n\r\nBiot, the savant, who had watched the experiment, declared that\r\nBlanchard did not stir himself, and that the variations of his course\r\nare alone to be attributed to the currents of air that he encountered.\r\nAs he had inscribed upon his flags, his balloons, and his entrance\r\ntickets, from which he realised a considerable sum, the ambitious\r\nlegend, Sic itur ad astra, the following epigram was produced respecting\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n     From the Field of Mars he took his flight:\r\n     In a field close by he tumbled;\r\n     But our money having taken\r\n     He smiled though sadly shaken,\r\n     As Sic itur ad astra he mumbled.\r\n\r\nWhat is most important to examine in each of the great aerial voyages\r\nthat have been made, is the special character which distinguishes them\r\nfrom average experiments. All our great voyages are rendered special\r\nand particular by the ideas of the men who undertook them, and the aims\r\nwhich they severally meant to achieve by them. The early ascents of\r\nMontgolfier had for their aim the establishment of the fact that any\r\nbody lighter than the volume of air which it displaces will rise in the\r\natmosphere; those of Roziers were undertaken to prove that man can apply\r\nthis principle for the purpose of making actual aerial voyages; those\r\nof Robertson, Gay-Lussac, &c., were undertaken for the purpose of\r\nascertaining certain meteorological phenomena; those of Conte Coutelle\r\napplied aerostation to military uses. A considerable number were made\r\nwith the view of organising a system of aerial navigation analogous\r\nto that of the sea-steerage in a certain direction by means of oars or\r\nsails--in a word, to investigate the possibility of sailing through\r\nthe air to any point fixed upon. It was with this object that the\r\nexperiments at Dijon took place, and these were the most serious\r\nattempts down to our times that have been made to steer balloons.\r\n\r\nAt the middle of the globe of the balloon were placed four oars, two\r\nsails, and a helm and these were under the management of the voyagers,\r\nwho sat in the car and worked them by means of ropes. The car was also\r\nfurnished with oars. The report of Guyton de Morveau to the Academy at\r\nDijon informs us that these different paraphernalia were not altogether\r\nuseless. The following extracts are from this report:--\r\n\r\n“The very strong wind which arose immediately before our departure, had\r\ndriven us down to tee ground many times, making us fear for the safety\r\nof our oars, &c., when we resolved to throw over as much ballast as\r\nwould enable us to rise against the wind. The ballast, including from 70\r\nto 80 lbs. of provisions, was thrown over, and then we rose so rapidly\r\nthat all the objects around were instantly passed and were very soon\r\nlost to view. The swelling form of our balloon told us that the gas\r\ninside had expanded under the heat of the sun and the lessening density\r\nof the surrounding air. We opened the two valves, but even this outlet\r\nwas insufficient, and we had to cut a hole about seven or eight inches\r\nlong in the lower part of the balloon, through which the gas might\r\nescape. At five minutes past five we passed above a village which we did\r\nnot know, and here we let fall a bag filled with bran, and carrying with\r\nit a flag and a written message to the effect that we were all well, and\r\nthat the barometer was recording 20 inches 9 lines, and the thermometer\r\none degree and a half below zero.”\r\n\r\nVery keen cold attacked the ears, but this was the only inconvenience\r\nexperienced, until the voyagers were lost in a sea of clouds that shut\r\nthem out from the view of the earth. The sun at length began to descend,\r\nand they then perceived, by a slackening in the lower part of the\r\nballoon, that it was time for them to think of returning to the earth.\r\nJudging from the compass that they were not far from the town of\r\nAuxonne, they resolved to use all their endeavours to reach that place.\r\nThe sailing appliances had been considerably damaged by the rough\r\nweather at starting. The rigging being disarranged, one of the oars had\r\ngot broken, another had become entangled in the rigging, so that there\r\nremained only two of the four oars, and these, being on the same side,\r\nwere absolutely useless during the greatest part of the voyage. The\r\nadventurers, however, assert that they made them work from eight to\r\nnine minutes with the greatest ease, making use of them to tack to the\r\nsouth-east.\r\n\r\n“We hoped then to be able to descend near where we judged Auxonne to\r\nbe,” the writer continues, “but we lost much gas by the opening in\r\nthe balloon, and descended more rapidly than we expected or wished. We\r\nlooked to our small stock of ballast with anxiety, but there was no need\r\nof it, and we came very softly down upon a slope.”\r\n\r\nWhen the aeronauts arrived at Magny-les-Auxonne, the inhabitants gazed\r\nupon them in terror, and two men and three women fell down on their\r\nknees before them.\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from the report of the experiment of the 12th of\r\nJune, the principal object of which was the attempt to discover the\r\nmeans of steering in a certain direction:--\r\n\r\n“M. de Verley and myself mounted in the balloon,” says Guyton\r\nde Morveau, “at seven o’clock. We rose rapidly and in an almost\r\nperpendicular direction. The fall of the mercury in the barometer\r\nwas scarcely perceptible when the dilation of the hydrogen gas in the\r\nballoon had become considerable. The globe swelled out, and a light\r\nvapour around the mouth announced to us that the gas was commencing\r\nto escape by the safety-valve. We assisted its escape by pulling the\r\nvalve-string.\r\n\r\n“Having reduced the dilation sufficiently for our purposes, we resolved\r\nto attempt the working of the balloon before the whole town and to turn\r\nit from the east to the north. We saw with pleasure that our machinery\r\nanswered By the working of the helm, the prow of our air-boat was\r\nturned in the direction we desired. The oars, working only on one side,\r\nsupported the helm, and altogether we got on as we wished. We described\r\na curve, crossing the road from Dijon to Langres. The mercury had\r\ndescended to 24 inches 8 lines, which announced that we were gradually\r\nrising. We attempted for some time to follow the route to I Langres, but\r\nthe wind drove us off our course in spite of all our efforts. At nine\r\no’clock our barometer informed us that we had ascended to the height of\r\n6,000 feet. M. de Verley took advantage of this elevation to put some\r\ntouch wood to a burning-glass 18 lines in diameter, and the touch wood\r\nlighted immediately.”\r\n\r\nThe aeronauts decided to direct their course for Dijon. After re-setting\r\nthe helm with this intention, they worked their oars, and proceeded in\r\nthat direction more than 1,000 feet. But heat and fatigue obliged them\r\nto suspend their endeavours, and the current drove them upon Mirebeau,\r\nwhere, throwing out the last of their ballast and regulating their\r\ndescent, they came softly down upon a corn-field.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers were cordially welcomed by the ecclesiastics and the\r\nmagistrates of the place, and after a time they, with their balloon,\r\nwere carried back on men’s shoulders to Dijon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\n     Experiment in Montgolfiers--Roziers and Proust--The Duke of\r\n     Chartres--The Comte d’Artois--Voyage of the Abbe Carnus to\r\n     Rodez.\r\n\r\nThe longest course travelled by Montgolfiere balloons, and the highest\r\nelevation reached by them, were achieved by Roziers and Proust with the\r\nMontgolfiere la Marie Antoinette, at Versailles, on the 23rd of June,\r\n1784. Roziers himself has left us a picturesque narrative of this\r\nexcursion from Versailles to Compiegne. He says:--\r\n\r\n“The Montgolfiere rose at first very gently in a diagonal line,\r\npresenting an imposing spectacle. Like a vessel which has just been\r\nprecipitated from the stocks, this astonishing machine hung balanced\r\nin the air for some time, and seemed to have got beyond human control.\r\nThese irregular movements intimidated a portion of the spectators, who,\r\nfearing that, should there be a fall, their lives would be in danger,\r\nscattered away with great speed from under us. After having fed my fire,\r\nI saluted the people, who answered me in the most cordial manner. I\r\nhad time to remark some faces, in which there was a mixed expression\r\nof apprehension and joy. In continuing our upward progress, I perceived\r\nthat an upper current of air made the Montgolfiere bend, but on\r\nincreasing the heat, we rose above the current. The size of objects on\r\nthe earth now began perceptibly to diminish, which gave us an idea of\r\nthe distance at which we were from them. It was then that we became\r\nvisible to Paris and its suburbs, and so great was our elevation that\r\nmany in the capital thought we were directly over their heads.\r\n\r\n“When we had arrived among the clouds, the earth disappeared from our\r\nview. Now a thick mist would envelop us, then a clear space showed us\r\nwhere we were, and again we rose through a mass of snow, portions of\r\nwhich stuck to our gallery. Curious to know how high we could ascend, we\r\nresolved to increase our fire and raise the heat to the highest degree,\r\nby raising our grating, and holding up our fagots suspended on the ends\r\nof our forks.\r\n\r\n“Having gained these snowy elevations, and not being able to mount\r\nhigher, we wandered about for some time in regions which we felt were\r\nnow visited by man for the first time. Isolated and separated entirely\r\nfrom nature, we perceived beneath us only enormous masses of snow,\r\nwhich, reflecting the sunshine, filled the firmament with a glorious\r\nlight. We remained eight minutes at this elevation, 11,732 feet above\r\nthe earth. This situation, however agreeable it might have been to the\r\npainter or the poet, promised little to the man of science in the way\r\nof acquiring knowledge; and so we determined, eighteen minutes after our\r\ndeparture, to return through the clouds to the earth. We had hardly left\r\nthis snowy abyss, when the most pleasant scene succeeded the most\r\ndreary one. The broad plains appeared before our view in all their\r\nmagnificence. No snow, no clouds were now to be seen, except around the\r\nhorizon, where a few clouds seemed to rest on the earth. We passed in a\r\nminute from winter to spring. We saw the immeasurable earth covered\r\nwith towns and villages, which at that distance appeared only so many\r\nisolated mansions surrounded with gardens. The rivers which wound about\r\nin all directions seemed no more than rills for the adornment of these\r\nmansions; the largest forests looked mere clumps or groves, and the\r\nmeadows and broad fields seemed no more than garden plots. These\r\nmarvellous tableaux, which no painter could render, reminded us of the\r\nfairy metamorphoses; only with this difference, that we were beholding\r\nupon a mighty scale what imagination could only picture in little. It is\r\nin such a situation that the soul rises to the loftiest height, that the\r\nthoughts are exalted and succeed each other with the greatest rapidity.\r\nTravelling at this elevation, our fire did not demand continual\r\nattention, and we could easily walk about the gallery. We were as much\r\nat peace upon our lofty balcony as we should have been upon the terrace\r\nof a mansion, enjoying all the pictures which unrolled themselves before\r\nus continually, without experiencing any of the giddiness which has\r\ndisturbed so many persons. Having broken my fork in my exertions to\r\nraise the balloon, I went to obtain another one. On my way to get it, I\r\nencountered my companion, M. Proust. We ought never to have been on\r\nthe same side of the balloon, for a capsize and the escape of all our\r\nhydrogen gas might have been the result. As it was, so well was the\r\nmachine ballasted, that the only effect of our being on the one side\r\nmade the balloon incline a little in that direction. The winds, although\r\nvery considerable, caused us no uneasiness, and we only knew the\r\nswiftness of our progress through the air by the rapidity with which the\r\nvillages seemed to fly away from under our feet; so that it seemed, from\r\nthe tranquillity with which we moved, that we were borne along by the\r\ndiurnal movement of the globe. Often we wished to descend, in order\r\nto learn what the people were crying to us the simplicity of our\r\narrangements enabled us to rise, to descend, to move in horizontal or\r\noblique lines, as we pleased and as often as we considered necessary,\r\nwithout altogether landing.”\r\n\r\nWhen they came to Luzarche, the delighted aeronauts resolved to land.\r\nAlready the people were testifying their pleasure at seeing them. Men\r\ncame running together from all directions, while all the animals rushed\r\naway with equal precipitation, no doubt taking the balloon for some\r\nwild beast. Finding that their course would lead them straight against\r\ncertain houses, the aeronauts again increased their fire, and, slightly\r\nrising, escaped the buildings that had been in their way. Shortly\r\nafterwards they safely landed forty miles from the spot from which they\r\nhad started.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the man of science or the mechanician that devoted\r\nhimself to the task of taking possession of the new empire, but the\r\nnobles gave their hands to the aeronauts, and humbly asked the favour of\r\nan ascent. The king had addressed letters to the Brothers Montgolfier,\r\nand the marvellous invention had become an affair of state. The princes\r\nof the blood and the nobles of the court considered it an honour to\r\ncount among the number of their friends a celebrated aeronaut.\r\n\r\nThe Count d’Artois, afterwards Charles X., and the Duke de Chartres,\r\nfather of Louis Philippe, made experiments in aerial navigation. The\r\nchemists Alban and Vallet made a magnificent balloon for the Count, who\r\nwent up many times in it, with several persons of all ranks.\r\n\r\nAlready at St. Cloud, the Duke of Chartres, afterwards Philippe Egalite,\r\nhad, on the 15th of July, 1784, made, with the Brothers Robert, an\r\nascent which put their courage to terrible tests. The hydrogen gas\r\nballoon was oblong, sixty feet high and forty feet in diameter, and\r\nit had been constructed upon a plan supplied by Meunier. In order to\r\nobviate the use of the valve, he had placed inside the balloon a smaller\r\nglobe, filled with ordinary air. This was done on the supposition that,\r\nwhen the balloon rose high, the hydrogen being rarefied would compress\r\nthe little globe within, and press out of it a quantity of ordinary air\r\nequal to the amount of its dilation.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock, the Brothers Robert--Collin and Hullin--and the Duke\r\nof Chartres, ascended in presence of an immense multitude. The nearest\r\nranks kneeled down to allow those behind to have a view of the departure\r\nof the balloon, which disappeared among the clouds amid the acclamations\r\nof the prostrate multitude. The machine, obedient to the stormy and\r\ncontrary winds which it met, turned several times completely round. The\r\nhelm, which had been fitted to the machine, and the two oars, gave such\r\na purchase to the winds that the voyagers, already surrounded by the\r\nclouds, cut them away. But the oscillations continued, and the little\r\nglobe inside not being suspended with cords, fell down in such an\r\nunfortunate manner as to close up the opening of the large balloon, by\r\nmeans of which provision had been made for the egress of the gas now\r\ndilated by the heat of the sun, which poured down its rays, a sudden\r\ngust having cleared the space of the clouds. It was feared that the case\r\nof the balloon would crack, and the whole thing collapse, in spite of\r\nthe efforts of the aeronauts to push back the smaller balloon from the\r\nopening. Then the Duke of Chartres seized one of the flags they carried,\r\nand with the lance-head pierced the balloon in two places. A rent of\r\nabout nine feet was the consequence, and the balloon began to descend\r\nwith amazing rapidity. They would have fallen into a lake had they not\r\nthrown over 60 lbs. of ballast, which caused them to rise a little, and\r\npass over to the shore, where they got safely to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe expedition lasted only a few minutes. The Duke of Chartres was\r\nrallied by his enemies, who accused him of cowardice; and Monjoie, his\r\nhistorian, making allusion to the combat of Ouessant, says that he had\r\ngiven proofs of his cowardice in the three elements--earth, air, and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nM. Gray, professor at the seminary of Rodez, presented us some years ago\r\nwith the following letter from the Abbe Carnus, upon the aerial voyage\r\nwhich he undertook, August 6th, 1784:--\r\n\r\n“The progress of the Montgolfiere was so sudden that one might almost\r\nhave believed that it arose all inflated and furnished out of some chasm\r\nin the earth The air was calm, the sky without clouds, the sun\r\nvery strong. Our fuel and instruments were put into the gallery, my\r\ncompanion, M. Louchet, was at his post, and I took mine. At twenty\r\nminutes past eight the cords were loosened, we waved a farewell to the\r\nspectators, and while two cannon-shots announced our departure, we were\r\nalready high above the loftiest buildings.\r\n\r\n“To the general acclamations of the crowd succeeded a profound silence.\r\nThe spectators, half in fear, half in admiration, stood motionless, with\r\neyes fixed, and gazing eagerly at the superb machine, which rose almost\r\nvertically with rapidity and also with grandeur. Some women, and even\r\nsome men, fainted away; others raised their hands to heaven; others shed\r\ntears; all grew pale at the sight of our bright fire.\r\n\r\n“‘We have quitted the earth,’ said I to my companion.\r\n\r\n“‘I compliment you on the fact,’ he answered; ‘keep up the fire!’\r\n\r\n“A truss of hay, steeped in spirits of wine accelerated the swiftness of\r\nour ascent. I cast my glance upon the town, which seemed to flee rapidly\r\nfrom under our feet. Terrestrial objects had already lost their shape\r\nand size. The burning heat which I felt at first now gave place to a\r\ntemperature of the most agreeable kind, and the air which we breathed\r\nseemed to contain healthful elements unknown to dwellers on the lower\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n“‘How well I am!’ I said to Louchet; ‘how are you?’\r\n\r\n“‘As well as can be. Would that I could dispatch a message to the\r\nearth!’\r\n\r\n“Immediately I threw over a roll of paper on which I had written the\r\nwords, ‘All well on board the City of Rodez.’\r\n\r\n“At thirty-two minutes past eight our elevation was at least 6,000 feet\r\nabove sea level. A flame from our fire, rising from eighteen to twenty\r\nfeet, sent us up another 1,000 feet. It was then that our machine was\r\nseen by every spectator within a circuit of nine miles, and it appeared\r\nto be right over the heads of all of them.\r\n\r\n“‘Send us up out of sight,’ said my adventurous confrere.\r\n\r\n“I had to moderate his ardour--a larger fire would have burnt our\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\n“From our moving observatory the most splendid view developed itself.\r\nThe boundaries of the horizon were vastly extended. The capital of the\r\nRouergue appeared to be no more than a group of stones, one of which\r\nseemed to rise to the height of two or three feet. This was no other\r\nthan the superb tower of the cathedral. Fertile slopes, agreeable\r\nvalleys, lofty precipices, waste lands, ancient castles perched upon\r\nfrowning rocks, these form the endlessly varied spectacle which the\r\nRouergue and the neighbouring provinces present to the view of those who\r\ntraverse the surface of the earth. But how different is the scene to the\r\naerial voyager! We could perceive only a vast country, perfectly round,\r\nand seemingly a little elevated in the middle, irregularly marked with\r\nverdure, but without inhabitants, without towns, valleys, rivers, or\r\nmountains. Living beings no longer existed for us; the forests were\r\nchanged into what looked like grassy plains; the ranges of the\r\nCantal and the Cevennes had disappeared; we looked in vain for the\r\nMediterranean, and the Pyrenees seemed only a long series of piles\r\nof snow, connected at their bases. Our own balloon, which from Rodez\r\nappeared about the size of a marble, was the only object that for us\r\nretained its natural dimensions. What wonderful sensations then arose\r\nwithin us! I had often reflected upon the works of nature; their\r\nmagnificence had always filled me with admiration. In this soul-stirring\r\nmoment how beautiful did nature seem--how grand! With what majesty did\r\nit strike my imagination. Never did man appear to me before such an\r\nexcellent being His latest triumph over the elements recalled to my mind\r\nhis other conquests of nature. My companion was animated with the same\r\nsentiments, and more than once we cried out, ‘Vive Montgolfier! Vive\r\nRoziers! Vivent ceux qui ont du courage et de la constance!’\r\n\r\n“In the meantime our fuel was getting near the end. In eighteen minutes\r\nwe had run a distance of 12,000 feet. ‘Make your observations while I\r\nattend to the fire,’ said my companion to me. I examined the barometer,\r\nthe thermometer, and the compass, and having sealed up a small bottle of\r\nthe air at this elevation, I asked my companion to reduce the fire. We\r\ndescended 1,800 feet, and at this height I filled another bottle with\r\nair.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards we felt the refreshing breath of a slight breeze, which\r\ncarried us gently toward the south-east. In six minutes we had run\r\n18,000 feet. Then, having only sufficient fuel to enable us to choose\r\nthe place of our descent, we considered whether we should not bring our\r\naerial voyage to a termination. We had neither lake nor forest to fear,\r\nand we were secure against danger from fire, as we could detach the\r\ngrating at some distance from the earth. At fifty-eight minutes past\r\neight all our fuel was exhausted, except two bundles of straw, of\r\nfour pounds each, which we reserved for our descent. The balloon came\r\ngradually down, and terrestrial objects began again to resume their\r\nproper forms and dimensions. The animals fled at the sight of our\r\nballoon, which seemed likely to crush them in its fall. Horsemen were\r\nobliged to dismount and lead their frightened horses. Terrified by such\r\nan unwonted sight, the labourers in the fields abandoned their work. We\r\nwere not more than 600 feet from the earth. We threw on the two bundles\r\nof straw, but still gradually descended. The grating was then detached,\r\nand I had no difficulty in leaping to the ground. But now a most\r\nsurprising and unlooked-for event happened. M. Louchet had not been able\r\nto descend at the same moment as myself, and the balloon, now free from\r\nmy weight, immediately re-ascended with the speed of a bird, bearing\r\naway my companion. I followed him with my eyes, and it was to my\r\nagreeable surprise that I heard him crying to me, ‘All is well; fear\r\nnot!’ though it was not without a species of jealousy that I saw him\r\nmounting up to the height of 1,400 or 1,500 feet. The balloon, after\r\nhaving run a distance of 3,600 feet in a horizontal direction, began\r\ngently to descend at four minutes past nine, at the village of Inieres,\r\nafter having travelled 42,000 feet from the point of departure. When it\r\nhad touched the ground it bumped up again two or three feet. M. Louchet\r\njumped out, and seized one of the ropes, but had much difficulty in\r\nholding the balloon in hand. He cried to the frightened peasants to come\r\nand help him. But they seemed to regard him as a dangerous magician,\r\nor as a monster, and they feared to touch the ropes lest they might be\r\nswallowed up by the balloon. Soon afterwards I came to the rescue. The\r\nballoon was in as thorough repair as when we began our journey. We then\r\npressed out the hot air, folded up the envelope, placed it upon a small\r\ncart drawn by two oxen, and drove off with it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\n     Serio-Comic Aspect of the Subject--The Public Duped--The\r\n     Abbes Miolan and Janninet at the Luxembourg--Caricatures--\r\n     The “Minerva” of Robertson, and its Voyage Round the World.\r\n\r\nThe discovery like that of balloons could not be made public in France\r\nwithout being travestied, and without offering some comic side for\r\nthe amusement of the wits of the day. Under some old coloured prints,\r\ndesigned with the intention of satirising such unfortunate aeronauts\r\nas had collected their money from the spectators, but had failed in\r\ninflating their balloons, is written, “The Infallible Means of Raising\r\nBalloons”--the infallible means consisting of ropes and pulleys.\r\n\r\nWhile caricature was thus turning its irony upon the efforts of\r\nbelievers in the new idea, serious pamphlets were being written and\r\npublished with the same object. One of these declares that the discovery\r\nis IMMORAL, I. Because since God has not given wings to man, it is\r\nimpious to try to improve his works, and to encroach upon his rights as\r\na Creator; 2. Because honour and virtue would be in continual danger,\r\nif balloons were permitted to descend, at all hours of the night, into\r\ngardens and close to windows; 3. Because, if the highway of the air were\r\nto remain open to all and sundry, the frontiers of nations would vanish,\r\nand property national and personal would be invaded, &c. We do not wish\r\nto gather together here the stones which critics threw against the new\r\ndiscovery, unaware all the time that these stones were falling upon\r\ntheir own heads.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to state that after the first ascents the public were\r\noften duped by pretending aeronauts, whose single aim was to sell their\r\ntickets, and who disappeared when the time came for ascending. The\r\nresult of these frauds was that sometimes honest men were made to suffer\r\nas rogues. Even in our own day, when an ascent, seriously intended,\r\nfails to succeed, owing to some unforeseen circumstances, the public\r\nfrequently manifests a decided ill-will to the aeronaut, who is\r\nperfectly honest, and only unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe famous ascent of the Abbes Miolan and Janninet, at the Luxembourg,\r\nmay be cited as among the failures which suffered most from the satire\r\nof the time. Their immense balloon, constructed at great expense at the\r\nobservatory, was expected to rise beyond the clouds, and a multitude,\r\neach of whom had paid dearly for his ticket, had assembled at the\r\nLuxembourg. The morning had been occupied in removing the balloon from\r\nthe observatory to the place of ascent, and at midday the inflation of\r\nit began. The rays of a burning July sun--and one knows what that is in\r\nthe Luxembourg in Paris--streamed down on the heads of the thousands of\r\nspectators. From six in the morning till four in the evening they had\r\nwaited to see the unheard-of wonder; the ascent, however, was to be so\r\nimposing, that nothing could be lost by waiting for it.\r\n\r\nBut at five in the afternoon the heavy machine was still\r\nmotionless--inert upon the ground. We need not attempt to describe the\r\nscene which took place as the impatience of the multitude increased.\r\nSneers of derision made themselves heard on all sides. A universal\r\nmurmur, rapidly developing into a clamour, arose amongst the multitude;\r\nthen, wild with disappointment, the frenzied populace threw themselves\r\nupon the barricade, broke it, attacked the gallery of the balloon, the\r\ninstruments, the apparatus, trampling them under foot, and smashing them\r\nin bits. They then rushed upon the balloon and fired it. There was then\r\na general melee. Far from fleeing the fire, every one struggled to seize\r\nand carry off a bit of the balloon, to preserve as a relic. The two\r\nabbes escaped as they best could, under protection of a number of\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAfter this there fell a perfect shower of lampoons and caricatures. The\r\nAbbe Miolan was represented as a cat with a band round its neck, while\r\nJanninet appeared as a donkey; and in a coloured print the cat and\r\nthe ass are shown arriving in triumph upon their famous balloon at the\r\nAcademy of Montmartre, and are received at the hill of Moulins-a-Vent\r\nby a solemn assembly of turkey-cocks and geese in different attitudes.\r\nNumerous songs and epigrams, of which the unfortunate abbes were the\r\nsubjects, also appeared at this time. The letters which composed the\r\nwords “l’Abbe Miolan” were found to form the anagram, Ballon abime--“the\r\nballoon swallowed up.”\r\n\r\nThe most extravagant balloon project was that of Robertson, who\r\npublished a scheme for making a tour of the world. He called it “La\r\nMinerva, an aerial vessel destined for discoveries, and proposed to\r\nall the Academies of Europe, by Robertson, physicist” (Vienna, 1804;\r\nreprinted at Paris, 1820), Robertson dedicated his project to Volta, and\r\nin his dedication he does not scruple to say: “In our age, my friendship\r\nseeks only one gratification, that we should both live a sufficiently\r\nlong time together to enable you to calculate and utilise the results\r\nof this great machine, while I take the practical direction of it.” The\r\nfollowing is this aeronaut’s prospectus:--\r\n\r\n“There is no limit to the sciences and the arts, which cultivation does\r\nnot overstep. We have everything to hope and to expect from time,\r\nfrom chance, and from the genius of man. The difference which there\r\nis between the canoe of the savage and the man-of-war of 124 guns is\r\nperhaps as great as that of balloons as they now are and as they will\r\nbe in the course of a century. If you ask of an aeronaut why he cannot\r\ncommand the motions of his balloon, he will ask of you in his turn why\r\nthe inventor of the canoe did not immediately afterwards construct a\r\nman-of-war. It must be recollected that there have not yet elapsed forty\r\nyears since the discovery of the balloon, and that to perfect it would\r\nbe a work of difficulty, as much from the increased knowledge which such\r\na work would demand, as from the pecuniary sacrifices and the personal\r\ndevotion which it would involve.\r\n\r\n“Thus this invention, after having at first electrified all savants\r\nfrom the one end of the world to the other, has suffered the fate of all\r\ndiscoveries--it was all at once arrested. Did not astronomy wait long\r\nfor Newton, and chemistry for Lavoisier, to raise them to something like\r\nthe splendour they now enjoy? Was not the magnet a long time a toy\r\nin the hands of the Chinese, without giving birth to the idea of the\r\ncompass? The electric fluid was known in the time of Thales, but\r\nhow many ages did we wait for the discovery of galvanism? Yet these\r\nsciences, which may be studied in silent retreats, were more likely to\r\nyield fruit to the discoverer than aerostatics, which demand courage\r\nand skill, and of which the experiments, which are always public, are\r\nattended with great cost.”\r\n\r\nRobertson’s proposed machine was to be 150 feet in diameter, and would\r\nbe capable of carrying 150,000 lbs. Every precaution was to be taken in\r\norder to make the great structure perfect. It was to accommodate sixty\r\npersons to be chosen by the academics, who should stay in it for several\r\nmonths should rise to all possible elevations, pass through all\r\nclimates in all seasons, make scientific observations, &c. This balloon,\r\npenetrating deserts inaccessible by other means of travel, and visiting\r\nplaces which travellers have never penetrated, would be of immense use\r\nin the science of geography: and when under the line, if the heat near\r\nthe earth should be inconvenient, the aeronauts would, of course, easily\r\nrise to elevations where the temperature is equal and agreeable. When\r\ntheir observations, their needs, or their pleasures demanded it, they\r\ncould descend to within a short distance of the earth, say ninety feet,\r\nand fix themselves in their position by means of an anchor. It might,\r\nperhaps, be possible, by taking the advantage of favourable winds, to\r\nmake the tour of the world. “Experience will perhaps demonstrate that\r\naerial navigation presents less inconvenience and less dangers than the\r\nnavigation of the seas.”\r\n\r\nThe immensity of the seas seemed to be the only source of insurmountable\r\ndifficulties; “but,” says Robertson, “over what a vast space might\r\nnot one travel in six months with a balloon fully furnished with the\r\nnecessaries of life, and all the appliances necessary for safety?\r\nBesides, if, through the natural imperfection attaching to all the works\r\nof man, or either through accident or age, the balloon, borne above the\r\nsea, became incapable of sustaining the travellers, it is provided with\r\na boat, which can withstand the waters and guarantee the return of the\r\nvoyagers.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the ideas promulgated regarding the “Minerva.” The following\r\nis the serious description given of the machine. The numbers correspond\r\nwith those on the illustration.\r\n\r\n“The cock (3) is the symbol of watchfulness; it is also the highest\r\npoint of the balloon. An observer, getting up through the interior to\r\nthe point at which the watchful fowl is placed, will be able to command\r\nthe best view to be had in the ‘Minerva.’ The wings at the side (1 and\r\n2) are to be regarded as ornamental. The balloon will be 150 feet in\r\ndiameter, made expressly at Lyons of unbleached silk, coated within and\r\nwithout with indict-rubber. This globe sustains a ship, which contains\r\nor has attached to it all the things necessary for the convenience, the\r\nobservations, and even the pleasures of the voyagers.\r\n\r\n“(a) A small boat, in which the passengers might take refuge in case\r\nof necessity, in the event of the larger vessel falling on the sea in a\r\ndisabled state.\r\n\r\n“(b) A large store for keeping the water, wine, and all the provisions\r\nof the expedition.\r\n\r\n“(cc) Ladders of silk, to enable the passengers to go to all parts of\r\nthe balloon.\r\n\r\n“(e) Closets.\r\n\r\n“(h) Pilot’s room.\r\n\r\n“(1) An observatory, containing the compasses and other scientific\r\ninstruments for taking the latitude.\r\n\r\n“(g) A room fitted up for recreations, walking, and gymnastics.\r\n\r\n“(m) The kitchen, far removed from the balloon. It is the only place\r\nwhere a fire shall be permitted.\r\n\r\n“(p) Medicine room.\r\n\r\n“(v) A theatre, music room, &c.\r\n\r\n“--The study.\r\n\r\n“(x) The tents of the air-marines, &c. &c.”\r\n\r\nThis balloon is certainly the most marvellous that has ever been\r\nimagined--quite a town, with its forts, ramparts, cannon, boulevards,\r\nand galleries. One can understand the many squibs and satires which so\r\nUtopian a notion provoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. First Aerial Voyage in England--Blanchard Crosses the Sea in\r\na Balloon.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their known powers of industry and perseverance, the English\r\ndid not throw themselves with any great ardour into the exploration\r\nof the atmosphere. From one cause or another it is the French and the\r\nItalians that have chiefly distinguished themselves in this art. The\r\nEnglish historian of aerostation gives some details of the first aerial\r\nvoyage made in this country by the Italian, Vincent Lunardy.\r\n\r\nThe balloon was made of silk covered with a varnish of oil, and painted\r\nin alternate stripes--blue and red. It was three feet in diameter. Cords\r\nfixed upon it hung down and were attached to a hoop at the bottom, from\r\nwhich a gallery was suspended. This balloon had no safety-valve--its\r\nneck was the only opening by which the hydrogen gas was introduced, and\r\nby which it was allowed to escape.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1784, it was carried to the Artillery Ground and filled\r\nwith gas. After being two-thirds filled, the gallery was attached with\r\nits two oars or wings, and Lunardy, accompanied by Biggin and Madame\r\nSage, took his place; but it was found that the balloon had not\r\nsufficient lifting power to carry up the whole three, and Lunardy went\r\nup alone, with the exception of the pigeon, the cat, and the dog, that\r\nwere with him.\r\n\r\nThe balloon rose to the height of about twenty feet, then followed a\r\nhorizontal line, and descended. But the gallery had no sooner touched\r\nthe earth than Lunardy threw over the sand that served as ballast, and\r\nmounted triumphantly, amid the applause of a considerable multitude of\r\nspectators. After a time he descended upon a common, where he left the\r\ncat nearly dead with cold, ascended, and continued his voyage. He says,\r\nin the narrative which he has left, that he descended by means of the\r\none oar which was left to him, the other having fallen over; but, as he\r\nstates that, in order to rise again, he threw over the remainder of his\r\nballast, it is natural to believe that the descent of the balloon was\r\ncaused by the loss of gas, because, if he descended by the use of the\r\noar, he must have re-ascended when he stopped using it. He landed in the\r\nparish of Standon, where he was assisted by the peasants.\r\n\r\nHe assures us again that he came down the second time by means of the\r\noar. He says:--“I took my oar to descend, and in from fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes I arrived at the earth after much fatigue, my strength being\r\nnearly exhausted. My chief desire was to escape a shock on reaching\r\nthe earth, and fortune favoured me.” The fear of a concussion seems to\r\nindicate that he descended more because of the weight of the balloon\r\nthan by the action of the oar.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the only scientific instrument he had was a thermometer\r\nwhich fell to 29 degrees. The drops of water which had attached\r\nthemselves to the balloon were frozen.\r\n\r\nThe second aerial journey in England was undertaken by Blanchard and\r\nSheldon. The latter, a professor of anatomy in the Royal Academy, is\r\nthe first Englishman who ever went up in a balloon. This ascent was made\r\nfrom Chelsea on the 16th October, 1784.\r\n\r\nThe same balloon which Blanchard had used in France served him on this\r\noccasion, with the difference that the hoop which went round the\r\nmiddle of it, and the parasol above the car, were dispensed with. At the\r\nextremity of his car he had fitted a sort of ventilator, which he was\r\nable to move about by means of a winch. This ventilator, together with\r\nthe wings and the helm, were to serve especially the purpose of steering\r\nat will, which he had often said was quite practicable as soon as a\r\ncertain elevation had been reached.\r\n\r\nThe two aeronauts ascended, having with them a number of scientific and\r\nmusical instruments, some refreshments, ballast, &c. Twice the ascent\r\nfailed, and eventually Sheldon got out, and Blanchard went up again\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nBlanchard says that, on this second ascent, he was carried first\r\nnorth-east, then east-south-east of Sunbury in Middlesex. He rose so\r\nhigh that he had great difficulty in breathing, the pigeon he had with\r\nhim escaped, but could hardly maintain itself in the rarefied air of\r\nsuch an elevated region, and finding no place to rest, came back\r\nand perched on the side of the car. After a time, the cold becoming\r\nexcessive, Blanchard descended until he could distinguish men on the\r\nearth, and hear their shouting. After many vicissitudes he landed upon\r\na plain in Hampshire, about seventy-five miles from the point of\r\ndeparture. It was observed that, so long as he could be clearly seen, he\r\nexecuted none of the feats with his wings, ventilator, &c., which he had\r\npromised to exhibit.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm about aerial voyages was now at its climax; the most\r\nwonderful deeds were spoken of as commonplace, and the word “impossible”\r\n was erased from the language. Emboldened by his success, Blanchard one\r\nday announced in the newspapers that he would cross from England to\r\nFrance in a balloon--a marvellous journey, the success of which depended\r\naltogether upon the course of the wind, to the mercy of which the bold\r\naeronaut committed himself.\r\n\r\nA certain Dr. Jeffries offered to accompany Blanchard. On the 7th of\r\nJanuary the sky was calm, in consequence of a strong frost during\r\nthe preceding night, the wind which was very light, being from the\r\nnorth-north-west. The arranged meets were made above the cliffs of\r\nDover. When the balloon rose, there were only three sacks of sand of 10\r\nlbs. each in it. They had not been long above ground when the barometer\r\nsank from 29.7 to 27.3. Dr. Jeffries, in a letter addressed to the\r\npresident of the Royal Society, describes with enthusiasm the spectacle\r\nspread out before him: the broad country lying behind Dover, sown with\r\nnumerous towns and villages, formed a charming view; while the rocks on\r\nthe other side, against which the waves dashed, offered a prospect that\r\nwas rather trying.\r\n\r\nThey had already passed one-third of the distance across the Channel\r\nwhen the balloon descended for the second time, and they threw over\r\nthe last of their ballast; and that not sufficing, they threw over some\r\nbooks, and found themselves rising again. After having got more than\r\nhalf way, they found to their dismay, from the rising of the barometer,\r\nthat they were again descending, and the remainder of their books were\r\nthrown over. At twenty-five minutes past two o’clock they had passed\r\nthree-quarters of their journey, and they perceived ahead the inviting\r\ncoasts of France. But, in consequence either of the loss or the\r\ncondensation of the inflammable gas, they found themselves once more\r\ndescending. They then threw over their provisions, the wings of the car,\r\nand other objects. “We were obliged,” says Jeffries, “to throw out the\r\nonly bottle we had, which fell on the water with a loud sound, and sent\r\nup spray like smoke.”\r\n\r\nThey were now near the water themselves, and certain death seemed to\r\nstare them in the face. It is said that at this critical moment Jeffries\r\noffered to throw himself into the sea, in order to save the life of his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“We are lost, both of us,” said he; “and if you believe that it will\r\nsave you to be lightened of my weight, I am willing to sacrifice my\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nThis story has certainly the appearance of romance, and belief in it is\r\nnot positively demanded.\r\n\r\nOne desperate resource only remained--they could detach the car and hang\r\non themselves to the ropes of the balloon. They were preparing to carry\r\nout this idea, when they imagined they felt themselves beginning to\r\nascend again. It was indeed so. The balloon mounted once more; they were\r\nonly four miles from the coast of France, and their progress through the\r\nair was rapid. All fear was now banished. Their exciting situation, and\r\nthe idea that they were the first who had ever traversed the Channel in\r\nsuch a manner, rendered them careless about the want of certain articles\r\nof dress which they had discarded. At three o’clock they passed over the\r\nshore half-way between Cape Blanc and Calais. Then the balloon, rising\r\nrapidly, described a great arc, and they found themselves at a greater\r\nelevation than at any part of their course. The wind increased in\r\nstrength, and changed a little in its direction. Having descended to the\r\ntops of the trees of the forest of Guines, Dr. Jeffries seized a branch,\r\nand by this means arrested their advance. The valve was then opened, the\r\ngas rushed out, and the aeronauts safely reached the ground after the\r\nsuccessful accomplishment of this daring and memorable enterprise.\r\n\r\nA number of horsemen, who had watched the recent course of the balloon,\r\nnow rode up, and gave the adventurers the most cordial reception. On the\r\nfollowing day a splendid fete was celebrated in their honour at Calais.\r\nBlanchard was presented with the freedom of the city in a box of gold,\r\nand the municipal body purchased the balloon, with the intention of\r\nplacing it in one of the churches as a memorial of this experiment, it\r\nbeing also resolved to erect a marble monument on the spot where the\r\nfamous aeronauts landed.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards Blanchard was summoned before the king, who\r\nconferred upon him an annual pension of 1,200 livres. The queen, who\r\nwas at play at the gambling table, placed a sum for him upon a card, and\r\npresented him with the purse which she won.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Zambeccari’s Perilous Trip Across the Adriatic Sea.\r\n\r\nThere is not in the whole annals of aerostation a more moving\r\ncatastrophe than that of the unfortunate Comte Zambeccari, who, during\r\nan aerial journey on October the 7th, 1804, was cast away on the waves\r\nof the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nThe history of Zambeccari is dramatic throughout. After having been\r\ntaken by the Turks and thrown into the Bay of Constantinople, from which\r\nhe with difficulty escaped, he devoted himself to the study and practice\r\nof aerial navigation. He fancied he could make use of a lamp supplied\r\nwith spirits of wine, the flame of which he could direct at will, in the\r\nhope of thus being able to steer the balloon in whatever direction he\r\nchose. One day his balloon damaged itself against a tree at Boulogne,\r\nand the spirits of wine set his clothes on fire. The flames with which\r\nthe aeronaut was covered only served to increase the ascending power of\r\nthe balloon, and the frightened spectators, among whom were Zambeccari’s\r\nyoung wife and children, saw him carried up into the clouds out of\r\nsight. He succeeded, however, in extinguishing the fire which surrounded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, he organised a series of experiments at Milan, for which he\r\nreceived, in advance, the sum of 8,000 crowns; but the experiments\r\nfailed, in consequence of the inclemency of the weather, the treachery\r\nof his assistants, and the malice of his rivals.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 7th of October, after a fall of rain which lasted\r\nforty-eight hours, and which had delayed the announced ascent, he\r\nresolved, whatever might happen, to carry it out, though all the chances\r\nwere against him. Eight young men whom he had instructed, and who had\r\npromised him their assistance in filling the balloon, failed him at the\r\ncritical moment. Still, however, he continued his labours, with the\r\nhelp of two companions, Andreoli and Grassetti. Wearied with his\r\nlong-continued efforts, dis-appointed and hungry, he took his place in\r\nthe car.\r\n\r\nThe two companions whom we have named went with him. They rose gently at\r\nfirst, and hovered over the town of Bologna. Zambeccari says, “The lamp,\r\nwhich was intended to increase our ascending force, became useless. We\r\ncould not observe the state of the barometer by the feeble light of a\r\nlantern. The insupportable cold that prevailed in the high region to\r\nwhich we had ascended, the weariness and hunger arising from my having\r\nneglected to take nourishment for twenty-four hours, the vexation\r\nthat embittered my spirit--all these combined produced in me a total\r\nprostration, and I fell upon the floor of the gallery in a profound\r\nsleep that was like death. ‘The same misfortune overtook my companion\r\nGrassetti. Andreoli was the only one who remained awake and able for\r\nduty--no doubt because he had taken plenty of food and a large quantity\r\nof rum. Still he suffered from the cold, which was excessive, and his\r\nendeavours to wake me were for a long time vain. Finally, however, he\r\nsucceeded in getting me to my feet, but my ideas were confused, and I\r\ndemanded of him, like one newly awaking from a dream, ‘What is the news?\r\nWhere are we? What time is it? How is the wind?’\r\n\r\n“It was two o’clock. The compass had been broken, and was useless; the\r\nwax light in the lantern would not burn in such a rarefied atmosphere.\r\nWe descended gently across a thick layer of whitish clouds, and when\r\nwe had got below them, Andreoli heard a sound, muffled and almost\r\ninaudible, which he immediately recognised as the breaking of waves in\r\nthe distance. Instantly he announced to me this new and fearful danger.\r\nI listened, and had not long to wait before I was convinced that he was\r\nspeaking the truth. It was necessary to have light to examine the state\r\nof the barometer, and thus ascertain what was our elevation above the\r\nsea level, and to take our measures in consequence. Andreoli broke five\r\nphosphoric matches, without getting a spark of fire. Nevertheless, we\r\nsucceeded, after very great difficulty, by the help of the flint\r\nand steel, in lighting the lantern. It was now three o’clock in the\r\nmorning--we had started at midnight. The sound of the waves, tossing\r\nwith wild uproar, became louder and louder, and I suddenly saw the\r\nsurface of the sea violently agitated just below us. I immediately\r\nseized a large sack of sand, but had not time to throw it over before we\r\nwere all in the water, gallery and all. In the first moment of fright,\r\nwe threw into the sea everything that would lighten the balloon--our\r\nballast, all our instruments, a portion of our clothing, our money, and\r\nthe oars. As, in spite of all this, the balloon did not rise, we threw\r\nover our lamp also. After having torn and cut away everything that did\r\nnot appear to us to be of indispensable necessity, the balloon, thus\r\nvery much lightened, rose all at once, but with such rapidity and to\r\nsuch a prodigious elevation, that we had difficulty in hearing each\r\nother, even when shouting at the top of our voices. I was ill, and\r\nvomited severely. Grassetti was bleeding at the nose; we were both\r\nbreathing short and hard, and felt oppression on the chest. As we were\r\nthrown upon our backs at the moment when the balloon took such a sudden\r\nstart out of the water and bore us with such swiftness to those high\r\nregions, the cold seized us suddenly, and we found ourselves covered all\r\nat once with a coating of ice. I could not account for the reason why\r\nthe moon, which was in its last quarter, appeared on a parallel line\r\nwith us, and looked red as blood.\r\n\r\n“After having traversed these regions for half an hour, at an\r\nimmeasurable elevation, the balloon slowly began to descend, and at\r\nlast we fell again into the sea, at about four in the morning I cannot\r\ndetermine at what distance we were from land when we fell the second\r\ntime. The night was very dark, the sea rolling heavily, and we were in\r\nno condition to make observations. But it must have been in the middle\r\nof the Adriatic that we fell. Although we descended gently, the gallery\r\nwas sunk, and we were often entirely covered with water. The balloon\r\nbeing now more than half empty, in consequence of the vicissitudes\r\nthrough, which we had passed, gave a purchase to the wind, which pressed\r\nagainst it as against a sail, so that by means of it we were dragged\r\nand beaten about at the mercy of the storm and the waves. At daybreak\r\nwe looked out and found ourselves opposite Pesaro, four miles from the\r\nshore. We were comforting ourselves with the prospect of a safe landing,\r\nwhen a wind from the land drove us with violence away over the open sea.\r\nIt was now full day, but all we could see were the sea, the sky, and the\r\ndeath that threatened us. Certainly some boats happened to come within\r\nsight; but no sooner did they see the balloon floating and striping upon\r\nthe water than they made all sail to get away from it. No hope was then\r\nleft to us but the very small one of making the coasts of Dalmatia,\r\nwhich were opposite, but at a great distance from us. Without the\r\nslightest doubt we should have been drowned if heaven had not mercifully\r\ndirected towards us a navigator who, better informed than those we had\r\nseen before, recognised our machine to be a balloon and quickly sent his\r\nlong-boat to our rescue. The sailors threw us a stout cable, which we\r\nattached to the gallery, and by means of which they rescued us when\r\nfainting with exposure. The balloon thus lightened, immediately rose\r\ninto the air, in spite of all the efforts of the sailors who wished to\r\ncapture it. The long boat received a severe shock from its escape,\r\nas the rope was still attached to it, and the sailors hastened to cut\r\nthemselves free. At once the balloon mounted with incredible rapidity,\r\nand was lost in the clouds, where it disappeared for ever from our view.\r\nIt was eight in the morning when we got on board. Grassetti was so ill\r\nthat he hardly showed any signs of life. His hands were sadly mutilated.\r\nCold, hunger, and the dreadful anxiety had completely prostrated me. The\r\nbrave captain of the vessel did everything in his power to restore us.\r\nHe conducted us safely to Ferrara, whence we were carried to Pola, where\r\nwe were received with the greatest kindness, and where I was compelled\r\nto have my fingers amputated.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. Garnerin--Parachutes--Aerostation at Public Fetes.\r\n\r\n“On the 22nd October, 1797,” says the astronomer Lalande, “at\r\ntwenty-eight minutes past five, Citizen Garnerin rose in a balloon from\r\nthe park of Monceau. Silence reigned in the assembly, anxiety and fear\r\nbeing painted on the visages of all. When he had ascended upwards of\r\n2,000 feet, he cut the cord that connected his parachute and car\r\nwith the balloon. The latter exploded, and Garnerin descended in his\r\nparachute very rapidly. He made a dreadful lurch in the air, that forced\r\na sudden cry of fear from the whole multitude, and made a number of\r\nwomen faint. Meanwhile Citizen Garnerin descended into the plain of\r\nMonceau; he mounted his horse upon the spot, and rode back to the park,\r\nattended by an immense multitude, who gave vent to their admiration for\r\nthe skill and talent of the young aeronaut. Garnerin was the first to\r\nundertake this most daring and dangerous venture. He had conceived the\r\nidea of this feat while lying a prisoner of state in Buda, Hungary.”\r\n Lalande adds that he went and announced his success at the Institute\r\nNational, which was assembled at the time, and which listened to him\r\nwith the greatest interest.\r\n\r\nRobertson conducted an experiment of descending by means of a parachute\r\nat Vienna, in 1804, in which he received all the glory, without\r\npartaking of any of the danger. He made the public preparations for an\r\nascent in the balloon, his pupil, Michaud, however, took his place in\r\nthe car, and made the ascent.\r\n\r\nRobertson says that on this occasion he yielded to the entreaties of a\r\nyoung man who was his pupil, and had begged to be allowed to make his\r\ndebut before such a great multitude. In this case a slight improvement\r\nwas made in the parachute. The car was surrounded by a cloth of silk,\r\nwhich, when the aeronaut cut himself away from the balloon, spread\r\nitself out in such a way as to form a second parachute.\r\n\r\nRobertson made all the preparations, and Michaud had no more to do than\r\nplace himself in the car. Loud applause arose on all sides. Michaud\r\nhad ascended 900 feet above the earth when the signal for his cutting\r\nhimself clear of the balloon was given, by the firing of a cannon. He\r\nat once cut the two strings, and the balloon soared away into the upper\r\nregions, whilst he was left for one terrible moment to fate. The fall\r\nwas at first rapid, but the two parachutes soon opened themselves\r\nsimultaneously, and presented a majestic appearance. In a few seconds\r\nthe aeronaut had traversed the space that intervened between him and\r\nthe assembly, and found himself safely landed on the ground, at a short\r\ndistance from the place whence he had set out, while the whole air\r\nwas rent with shouts of applause. This experiment was deemed a most\r\nextraordinary one. Compliments were showered upon Robertson from all\r\nsides, and the court presented him with rich presents.\r\n\r\nBalloons have always formed a prominent feature at the fetes of\r\nParis, for the celebration of the chief events of the Revolution, the\r\nConsulate, and the Empire--the first of these epochs being that in which\r\nthese aerial vessels were held in highest esteem.\r\n\r\nJacques Garnerin had played a brilliant role as aeronaut under the\r\nDirectory, the Consulate, and the Empire; and it was he who after the\r\ncoronation of the Emperor Napoleon I., was charged with the raising of a\r\nmonster balloon, which was arranged to ascend, with the accompaniment of\r\nfireworks, on the evening of the 16th of December, 1804.\r\n\r\nAn uncommon incident connected with this event serves to show us the\r\nspirit of fatalism with which the character of Napoleon I. was infected.\r\n“The Man of Destiny” believed in the destiny of man; he had faith in\r\nhis star alone; and from the height of his greatness the new ruler,\r\nconsecrated emperor and king by the Pope, beheld a presage of misfortune\r\nin a chance circumstance, insignificant to all but himself, in the\r\nexperiment of which we are about to recount the history.\r\n\r\nThe fete given by the city of Paris to their majesties embraced the\r\nwhole town, from the Champs Elysees to the Barriere du Trone, on the\r\nsquare of the Hotel de Ville. Upon the river throughout its length\r\nbetween the Isle of St. Louis and the bridge of Notre Dame, an immense\r\ndisplay of fireworks was to take place. The scene to be represented was\r\nthe passage of Mont St. Bernard. Garnerin was stationed with his balloon\r\nin front of the gate of the church of Notre Dame. At eleven o’clock in\r\nthe evening, at the moment when the first discharge of fireworks made\r\nthe air luminous with a hundred thousand stars, Garnerin threw off his\r\nimmense balloon. The chief feature of it was the device of a crown,\r\ndesigned in coloured lanterns arranged round the globe. It rose\r\nsplendidly, and with the most perfect success.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the inhabitants of Rome were astounded to\r\nbehold advancing toward them from the horizon a luminous globe, which\r\nthreatened to descend upon their city. The excitement was intense.\r\nThe balloon passed the cupola of St. Peter’s and the Vatican; then\r\ndescending, it touched the ground, but rose again, and finally it sank\r\ninto the wafers of Lake Bracciano.\r\n\r\nIt was drawn from the water, and the following inscription, emblazoned\r\nin letters of gold upon its vast circumference, was printed, published,\r\nand read throughout the whole of Italy--“Paris, 25eme Primaire, an\r\nXIII., couronnement de l’empereur Napoleon, 1er par S.S. Pie VII.”\r\n\r\nIn touching the earth, the balloon happened to strike against the tomb\r\nof the Emperor Nero, and, owing to the concussion, a portion of the\r\ncrown was left upon this ancient monument. The Italian journals, which\r\nwere not so strictly under the supervision of the government as were the\r\njournals of France, gave the full particulars of these minor events; and\r\ncertain of them, connecting the names of Nero and Napoleon, indulged in\r\nmalicious remarks at the expense of the French emperor. These facts\r\ncame to the ear of the great general, who manifested much indignation,\r\ndismissed the innocent Garnerin from his post, and appointed Madame\r\nBlanchard to the supervision of all the balloon ascents which took place\r\nat the public fetes.\r\n\r\nThe balloon was preserved in the vaults of the Vatican in Rome,\r\naccompanied with an inscription narrating its travels and wonderful\r\ndescent--minus the circumstance of the tomb. It was removed, as might be\r\nsupposed, in 1814. From this time the ascents of balloons took place\r\nfor the most part only on the occasions of coronations and other great\r\npublic fetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. Green’s Great Journey Across Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that at the origin of navigation, man, before he had\r\ninvented oars and sails, made use of trunks of trees upon which he\r\ntrusted himself, leaving the rest to the winds and the currents of\r\nthe water, whether these were known or unknown. There is some analogy\r\nbetween such rude rafts, the first discovered means of navigation on\r\nwater, and balloons, the first discovered means of navigation in air.\r\nBut unquestionably the advantage is with the latter. No means have yet\r\nbeen found of directly steering balloons, but by allowing the gas to\r\nescape the aeronaut can descend at will, and by lightening his car of\r\npart of the ballast he carries he can ascend as readily. It must also be\r\nremembered that the currents of air vary in their directions, according\r\nto their elevation, and were the aeronaut perfectly acquainted with\r\naerial currents, he might, by raising or lowering himself, find a wind\r\nblowing in the direction in which he wished to proceed, and the last\r\nproblem of aerostation would be solved. That any such knowledge can ever\r\nbe acquired it is impossible to say; but this much may with safety be\r\nadvanced, that distant journeys may frequently be taken with balloons\r\nfor useful purposes.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable excursions of this kind was that\r\nsuperintended by Green, in 1836, from London to Germany. This journey,\r\n1,200 miles in length, is the longest that has been yet accomplished.\r\nGreen set out from London on the 7th of November, 1836, accompanied by\r\ntwo friends--Monk-Mason, the historian of the journey, and a gentleman\r\nnamed Molland. Not knowing to what quarter of the globe he might be\r\nblown, Green provided himself with passports to all the states of\r\nEurope, and with a quantity of provisions sufficient to last him for\r\nsome time, should he be driven by the wind over the sea. Shortly after\r\nmid-day the balloon rose with great grandeur, and, urged by a light\r\nbreeze, floated to the south-east, over the plains of Kent. At four\r\no’clock the voyagers sighted the sea.\r\n\r\n“It was forty-eight minutes past four,” says Monk-Mason, “that we first\r\nsaw the line of waves breaking on the shores beneath us. It would\r\nhave been impossible to have remained unmoved by the grandeur of the\r\nspectacle that spread out before us. Behind us were the coasts of\r\nEngland, with their white cliffs half lost in the coming darkness.\r\nBeneath us on both sides the ocean spread out far end wide to where the\r\ndarkness closed in the scene. Opposite us a barrier of thick clouds\r\nlike a wall, surmounted all along its line with projections like so many\r\ntowers, bastions, and battlements, rose up from the sea as if to stop\r\nour advance. A few minutes afterwards we were in the midst of this\r\ncloudy barrier, surrounded with darkness, which the vapours of the night\r\nincreased. We heard no sound. The noise of the waves breaking on the\r\nshores of England had ceased, and our position had for some time cut us\r\noff from all the sounds of earth.”\r\n\r\nIn an hour the Straits of Dover were cleared, the lights of Calais shone\r\nout toward the voyagers, and the sound of the town drums rose up toward\r\nthem. “Darkness was now complete,” continues the writer, “and it was\r\nonly by the lights, sometimes isolated, sometimes seen in masses, and\r\nshowing themselves far down on the earth beneath us, that we could form\r\na guess of the countries we traversed, or of the towns and villages\r\nwhich appeared before us every moment. The whole surface of the earth\r\nfor many leagues round showed nothing but scattered lights, and the\r\nface of the earth seemed to rival the vault of heaven with starry fires.\r\nEvery moment in the earlier part of the night before men had betaken\r\nthemselves to repose, clusters of lights appeared indicating large\r\ncentres of population.\r\n\r\n“Those on the horizon gave us the notion of a distant conflagration. In\r\nproportion as we approached them, these masses of lights appeared to\r\nincrease, and to cover a greater space, until, when right over them,\r\nthey seemed to divide themselves into different parts, to stretch out in\r\nlong streets, and to shine in starry quadrangles round the squares, so\r\nthat we could see the exact plan of each city, given as on a small map.\r\nIt would be difficult to give an idea of what sort of effect such a\r\nscene in such circumstances produces. To find oneself transported in\r\nthe darkness of night, in the midst of vast solitudes of air, unknown,\r\nunperceived, in secret and in silence, exploring territories, traversing\r\nkingdoms, watching towns which come into view, and pass out of it\r\nbefore one can examine them in detail--these circumstances are enough\r\nin themselves to render sublime a science which, independent of these\r\nadjuncts, would be so interesting. If you add to this the uncertainty\r\nwhich, increasing as we went on into the night, began to assail us\r\nrespecting our voyage, our ignorance of where we were, and what were the\r\nobjects we were attempting to discover, you may form some idea of our\r\nsingular position.”\r\n\r\nAbout midnight, the travellers found themselves above Liege. Situated\r\nin the midst of a thickly-peopled country, full of foundries, smelting\r\nworks, and forges, this town was quite a blaze of light. The gas-lamps\r\nwith which this town is so well lighted, clearly marked out for our\r\ntravellers the main streets, the squares, and the public buildings. But\r\nafter midnight, at which time the lamps in continental towns are mostly\r\nput out, the whole of the under world disappeared from the view of the\r\naeronauts.\r\n\r\n“After the turn of the night,” says Mason, “the moon did not show\r\nitself, and the heavens, always more sombre when regarded from great\r\naltitudes, seemed to us to intensify the natural darkness. On the\r\nother hand, by a singular contrast, the stars shone out with unusual\r\nbrilliancy, and seemed like living sparks sown upon the ebony vault that\r\nsurrounded us. In fact, nothing could exceed the intensity of the night\r\nwhich prevailed during this part of our voyage. A black profound abyss\r\nsurrounded us on all sides, and, as we attempted to penetrate into the\r\nmysterious deeps, it was with difficulty we could beat back the idea and\r\nthe apprehension that we were making a passage through an immense mass\r\nof black marble, in which we were enclosed, and which, solid to within a\r\nfew inches of us, appeared to open up at our approach.”\r\n\r\nUntil three o’clock the voyagers were in this state. The height of the\r\nballoon, as calculated by the barometer, was 2,000 feet. They had not\r\nthen anything to fear from a disastrous encounter, when all at once a\r\nsudden explosion was heard, the silk of the balloon quivered, the car\r\nreceived a violent shock, and seemed to be shot suddenly into the gloomy\r\nabyss. A second explosion and a third succeeded, accompanied each time\r\nby this fearful shock to the car. The travellers soon found out that,\r\nowing to the great altitude, the gas had expanded, and the rope which\r\nsurrounded it, saturated with water, and frozen with the intense cold,\r\nhad yielded to the pressure, in jerks which caused the report and the\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n“From time to time,” continues Mason, “vast masses of clouds covered the\r\nlower regions of the atmosphere, and spread a thick, whitish veil over\r\nthe earth, intercepting our view, and leaving us for some time uncertain\r\nif this was not a continuation of the same plains covered with snow\r\nwhich we had already noticed. From these masses of vapour, there seemed\r\nmore than once during the night to come a sound as of a great fall of\r\nwater, or the contending waves of the sea; and it required all the force\r\nof our reason, joined to our knowledge--such as it was--of the direction\r\nof our route, to repress the idea that we were approaching the sea, and\r\nthat, driven by the wind, we had, been carried along the coasts of\r\nthe North Sea or the Baltic. As the day advanced these apprehensions\r\ndisappeared. In place of the unbroken surface of the sea, we gradually\r\nmade out the varied features of a cultivated country, in the midst of\r\nwhich flowed a majestic river, which lost itself, at both extremities,\r\nin the mist that still lay on the horizon.”\r\n\r\nThis river was the Rhine, and as the neighbourhood seemed suitable for\r\na descent, and as the travellers did not wish to be carried too far into\r\nthe heart of Europe, they allowed a portion of the gas to escape, came\r\ngradually down, and dropped their anchor.\r\n\r\nIt was then half-past seven in the morning. It was only then that\r\nthe inhabitants, who had hitherto held themselves aloof, watching the\r\nmovements of the strangers from under the brushwood, began to assemble\r\nfrom all sides. A few words in German spoken from the balloon dissipated\r\ntheir fears, and, recovering from their mistrust, they hastened\r\nimmediately to lend assistance to the aeronauts The latter were now\r\ninformed that the place they had selected for their descent was in the\r\nDuchy of Nassau. The town of Wiberg, where Blanchard had descended,\r\nafter his ascent at Frankfort in 1785 was, by a singular chance, only\r\ntwo leagues distant. The three aeronauts received a most flattering\r\nreception, and, in memory of the event, they placed the flag which they\r\nhad borne in their car during their adventurous excursion in the ducal\r\npalace, side by side with that of Blanchard.\r\n\r\n“Thus,” says Mason, “terminated an expedition which, whether we regard\r\nthe extent of the journey, the length of time occupied in it, or\r\nthe results which were the objects of the experiment, may justly be\r\nconsidered as one of the most interesting and most important ever\r\nundertaken. The best answer which one could give to those who would be\r\ndisposed to criticise the employment of the peculiar means which we\r\nmade use of, or to doubt their efficiency, would be to state that, after\r\nhaving traversed without hindrance, without either danger or difficulty,\r\nso large a portion of the European continent, we arrived at our\r\ndestination still in possession of as much force as, had we wished it,\r\nmight have carried us round the whole world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. The “Geant” Balloon.\r\n\r\nNot a few of our readers will remember the ascent of Nadar’s colossal\r\nballoon from Paris, on Sunday, the 18th of October, 1863. This balloon\r\nwas remarkable as having attached to it a regular two-story house for a\r\ncar. Its ascent was witnessed by nearly half a million of persons. The\r\nballoon, after passing over the eastern part of France, Belgium, and\r\nHolland, suffered a disastrous descent in Hanover the day after it\r\nstarted on its perilous journey. It was a fool-hardy enterprise to\r\nconstruct such a gigantic and unmanageable balloon, presenting such an\r\nimmense surface to the atmosphere, and being so susceptible to adverse\r\naerial currents as to become the helpless prey of the elements; and it\r\nwas still more fool-hardy to place the lives of its passengers at the\r\nmercy of such terrible and ungovernable forces. A large section of the\r\npublic laboured under the delusion that Nadar’s balloon was one capable\r\nof being steered. In reality, however, the ‘Geant’ was unquestionably\r\nthe most rebellious and unruly specimen of its class that has been made\r\nsince the days of Montgolfier. The object in view when this formidable\r\nmonster was designed and constructed was to create the means to collect\r\nsufficient funds to form a “Free Association for Aerial Navigation\r\nby means of MACHINES HEAVIER THAN AIR,” and for the construction of\r\nmachines on this principle. The receipts from the exhibition of the\r\n“Geant” were intended to form the first capital of the association. The\r\nhopes, however, of the promoters have not been realised in this respect;\r\nfor while the expenses of the construction of the balloon have amounted,\r\ndirectly and indirectly, to the sum of L8,300, its two ascents in Paris\r\nand its exhibition in London produced only L3,300.\r\n\r\nSpace forbids us to enter at length on the various stages of the idea of\r\naerial navigation by means of an apparatus heavier than the atmosphere.\r\nThe idea is not, however, by any means so absurd as it appears at first\r\nsight. Those who, like Arago, declare that the word “impossible”\r\n does not exist, except in the higher mathematics, and those who look\r\nhopefully to the future instead of resting content with the past, will\r\njoin in applauding the spirit which dictated the manifesto of aerial\r\nlocomotion to the founder of the association which we are about to\r\ndescribe. M. Babinet, speaking on this subject before the French\r\nPolytechnic Association, said: “It is absurd to talk of guiding\r\nballoons. How will you set about it? How is it possible that a\r\nballoon--say, for instance, like the Flesselles, whose diameter measures\r\n120 feet--can resist and manoeuvre against opposing winds or currents\r\nof air? It would require a power equal to 400 horses for the sails of a\r\nship to struggle on equal terms with the wind. Suppose an impossibility,\r\nnamely, that a balloon could carry with it a force equal to 400\r\nhorse-power; this result would be of little use, for under the immense\r\nweight the fragile covering of the balloon would instantly collapse. If\r\nall the horses of a regiment were harnessed to the car of a balloon by\r\nmeans of a long rope, the result would be that the balloon would fly\r\ninto shivers, being too fragile to withstand these two opposing forces.\r\nMan must seek to raise himself in the air by another mode of operation\r\naltogether, if he wish to guide himself at the same time. Some time\r\nago I bought a play thing, very much in vogue at that time, called a\r\nStropheor. This toy was composed of a small rotating screw propeller,\r\nwhich revolved on its own support when the piece of string wound round\r\nit was pulled sharply. The screw was rather heavy, weighing nearly a\r\nquarter of a pound, and the wings were of tin, very broad and thick.\r\nThis machine, however, was rather too eccentric for parlour use, for its\r\nflight was so violent that it was continually breaking the pier glass,\r\nif there was one in the room; and, failing this, it next attacked the\r\nwindows. The ascending force of this machine is so great that I have\r\nseen one of them fly over Antwerp Cathedral, which is one of the highest\r\nedifices in the world. The air from underneath the machine is exhausted\r\nby the action of the screw, which, passing under the wings, causes a\r\nvacuum, while the air above it replenishes and fills this void, and\r\nunder the influence of these two causes the apparatus mounts from the\r\nearth. But the problem is not solved by means of this plaything, whose\r\nmotive power is exterior to it. Messrs. Nadar, Ponton, D’Amecourt, and\r\nDe la Landelle teach us better than this, although the wings of their\r\ndifferent models are entirely unworthy of men who desire to demonstrate\r\na truth to short-lived mortals. We have only arrived as yet at the\r\ninfancy of the process, but we have made a good beginning, for, having\r\nonce proved that a machine capable of raising itself in the air, wholly\r\nunaided from without, can be made, we have overcome with this apparently\r\nsmall result the whole difficulty. The principle of propulsion by means\r\nof a screw is by no means a novelty. It was first utilised in windmills,\r\nwhose sails are nothing more nor less than an immense screw which is\r\nturned by the action of the wind on its surface. In the case of turbine\r\nwater-wheels, where perhaps 970 cubic feet of water are utilised by\r\nmeans of a mechanism not larger than a hat, we see another illustration\r\nof it, with this difference, that water takes the place of wind as the\r\nmotive power.\r\n\r\n“The aerial screw is beset with great difficulties, but if we can\r\nsucceed through its agency in raising even the smallest weight, we may\r\nbe confident of being able to raise a heavier one, for a large machine\r\nis always more powerful in proportion to its size than a small one.\r\n\r\n“Mlle. Garnerin once made a bet that she would guide herself in her\r\ndescent from a considerable altitude towards a fixed spot on the earth\r\nat some distance, with no other help than the parachute; and she was\r\nreally able to guide herself to within a few feet of the specified spot,\r\nby simply altering the inclination of the parachute.\r\n\r\n“From observations in mountainous districts, where large birds of prey\r\nmay be seen to the best advantage hovering with outstretched wings, I\r\nhave come to the conclusion that they first of all attain the requisite\r\nheight and then, extending their wings in the form of a parachute,\r\nlet themselves glide gradually towards the desired spot. Marshal Niel\r\nconfirms this opinion by his experience in the mountains of Algeria.\r\nIt is, therefore, clear from these examples that we should possess the\r\npower of transporting ourselves from place to place if we could only\r\ndiscover a means of raising a weight perpendicularly in the air, which\r\nwould then act as a capital of power, only requiring to be expended at\r\nwill.”\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing remarks we may gather an idea of the importance which\r\nmay be attached to aerial locomotion notwithstanding the successive\r\nfailures of all those who have hitherto taken up the subject. We come\r\nnow to the description of the memorable ascent of the ‘Geant.’\r\n\r\nWe learn from the very interesting account of the ‘Geant,’ published at\r\nthe time, all the mishaps and adventures it outlived from the time of\r\nthe first stitch in its covering to its final inflation with gas. We\r\nmust, however, be content to take up the narrative at the point at which\r\nthe ‘Geant,’ with thirteen passengers on board, had, in obedience to\r\nthe order to “let go,” been released from the bonds which held it to\r\nthe earth. The narrative is, as our readers will perceive, written in\r\nsomewhat exaggerated language:--\r\n\r\n“The ‘Geant’ gave an almost imperceptible shake on finding itself\r\nfree, and then commenced to rise. The ascent was slow and gradual at\r\nfirst--the monster seemed to be feeling its way. An immense shout rose\r\nwith it from the assembled multitude. We ascended grandly, whilst the\r\ndeafening clamour of two hundred thousand voices seemed to increase.\r\nWe leant over the edge of the car, and gazed at the thousands of faces\r\nwhich were turned towards us from every point of the vast plain, in\r\nevery conceivable angle of which we were the common apex. We still\r\nascended. The summits of the double row of trees which surround the\r\nChamp de Mars were already under us. We reached the level of the cupola\r\nof the Military School. The tremendous uproar still reached us. We\r\nglided over Paris in an easterly direction, at the height of about six\r\nhundred feet. Every one took up the best possible position on the six\r\nlight cane stools, and on the two long bunks at either end of the car,\r\nand contemplated the marvellous panorama spread out under us, of which\r\nwe never grew weary.\r\n\r\n“There is never any dizziness in a balloon, as is often erroneously\r\nsupposed, for in it you are the only point in space without any\r\npossibility of comparison with another, and therefore the means of\r\nbecoming giddy are not at hand.”\r\n\r\nA very experienced aeronaut, who numbers his ascents by hundreds, has\r\nassured me that he never knew of a single case of dizziness.\r\n\r\n“The earth seems to unfold itself to our view like an immense and\r\nvariegated map, the predominant colour of which is green in all its\r\nshades and tints. The irregular division of the country into fields made\r\nit resemble a patchwork counterpane. The size of the houses, churches,\r\nfortresses, was so considerably diminished as to make them resemble\r\nnothing so much as those playthings manufactured at Carlsruhe. This was\r\nthe effect produced by a microscopic train, which whistled very faintly\r\nto attract our attention, and which seemed to creep along at a snail’s\r\npace, though doubtless going at the rate of thirty miles an hour, and\r\nwas enveloped in a minute cloud of smoke. What a lasting impression this\r\nmicroscopic neatness makes on us! What is that white puff I see down\r\nthere? the smoke of a cigar? No: it is a cloud of mist. It must be a\r\nperfect plain that we are looking at, for we cannot distinguish between\r\nthe different altitudes of a bramble-bush and an oak a hundred years\r\nold!\r\n\r\n“It is one of the delights of an aeronaut to gaze on the familiar scenes\r\nof earth from the immense height of the car of a balloon! What earthly\r\npleasure can compare with this! Free, calm, silent, roving through this\r\nimmense and hospitable space, where no human form can harm me, I despise\r\nevery evil power; I can feel the pleasure of existence for the first\r\ntime, for I am in full possession, as on no other occasion, of perfect\r\nhealth of mind and body. The aeronauts of the ‘Geant’ will scarcely\r\ncondescend to pity those miserable mortals whom they can only faintly\r\nrecognise by their gigantic works, which appear to them not more\r\ndignified than ant-hills!\r\n\r\n“The sun had already set behind the purple horizon in our rear. The\r\natmosphere was still quite clear round the ‘Geant,’ although there was\r\na thick haze underneath, through which we could occasionally see lights\r\nglimmering from the earth. We had attained a sufficient altitude to be\r\nonly just able to hear noises from villages that we left beneath us, and\r\nwere beginning to enjoy the delicious calm and repose peculiar to aerial\r\nascents.\r\n\r\n“There is, however, a talk about dinner, or rather supper, and night is\r\nnow fast approaching. Every one eats with the best possible appetite.\r\nHams, fowls and dessert only appear to disappear with an equal\r\npromptitude, and we quench our thirst with bordeaux and champagne. I\r\nremind our companions of the pigeons we brought with us, and which are\r\nhanging in a cage outside the railing. I knew there was no danger of\r\ntheir flying away, so fearlessly opened the cage. The three or four\r\nbirds I had put in the car seemed struck with terror. They flew\r\nawkwardly towards the centre of our party, tumbling among the plates and\r\ndishes and under our feet. It was not a case of hunger with them, and I\r\nought to have remembered that their feeding time was long since past. I\r\nreplaced them in their cage.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, the sun has left us for some time. Our longing gaze followed\r\nit behind the dark clouds in the horizon, whose edges it tipped with a\r\nglorious purple. Its last rays shone on us, and then came a bluish-grey\r\ntwilight. Suddenly we are enveloped in a dense fog. We look around,\r\nabove us. Everything has disappeared in the mist. The balloon itself is\r\nno longer visible. We can see nothing except the ropes which suspend\r\nus, and these are only visible for a few feet above our heads, when they\r\nlose themselves in the fog. We are alone with our wickerwork house in an\r\nunfathomable vault.\r\n\r\n“We still ascend, however, through the compact and terrible fog, which\r\nis so solid-looking as to seem capable of being carved into forms with\r\na knife. As we were without a moon, and had no light at all, in fact,\r\nwe were unable to distinguish nicely the different shades of colour in\r\nthese thick clouds. Now and then, when the clouds seemed to be\r\nlighter, they had a bluish tinge; but the thicker ones were dirty and\r\nmuddy-looking. Dante must have seen some like these.\r\n\r\n“Water trickled down our faces, hands, and clothes, and the ropes and\r\nsides of our car.\r\n\r\n“The water did not fall in rain-drops or in flakes, as it sometimes\r\ndoes in the tropics; but we were as completely saturated by this heavy,\r\npenetrating mist as if we had been under a waterfall. We still continued\r\nto traverse these rainy regions. The thick fog which the balloon\r\ndislodged in forcing a passage closed immediately after it. At one\r\nmoment I thought I felt something press against my cheek, which could\r\nonly be compared to the points of a thousand needles, or to floating\r\nparticles of ice. We were all of us too much absorbed with our situation\r\nto think of the hour or of the height to which we had attained. Suddenly\r\nthe Prince of Wittgenstein, who was standing at my left hand, cried out\r\nunder his breath--\r\n\r\n“‘Look at the balloon, sir! look at the balloon!’\r\n\r\n“I raised my eyes, in company with several others, and shall never\r\nforget the magnificent sight which awaited them. I saw the balloon,\r\nfor which I had been searching in vain a few minutes before. It had\r\nundergone a transformation. It looked now as if coated with silver,\r\nand floating in a pale phosphorescent glimmer. All the ropes and cords\r\nseemed to be of new, bright, and liquid silver, like mercury, caused\r\nby the mist which had rested on them becoming suddenly congealed. Two\r\nluminous arcs intervened between us, in a sea of mother-of-pearl and\r\nopal, the lower one being the colour of red ochre and the upper one\r\norange. Both of them, blinding in their brilliancy, seemed about to\r\nembrace one another.\r\n\r\n“‘How far are they off?’ thought I to myself. ‘Can I touch them with\r\nmy hand, or are they separated from me by an immense space?’ We are not\r\ncapable of forming ideas of perspective, floating as we are in the midst\r\nof such a glimmering splendour.\r\n\r\n“Above and around us are nothing but thick fogs and enormous black\r\nclouds, whose ragged edges and backs are relieved by a pale silver\r\ncoating. They undulate ceaselessly to and fro, and either usurp\r\nquietly the place of others, or disappear only to be superseded by more\r\nformidable ones. But the last ray of reflected light has died out, and\r\nwe plunge into this chaos of dreadful forms. Monsters seem to wish to\r\napproach us, and to envelop us in their dark embraces. One of them, on\r\nmy right hand, looks like a deformed human arm in a menacing attitude,\r\nwrithing its jagged top like a blind serpent feeling its way. The vague\r\nmonster has disappeared; but the momentary splendour being followed\r\nby the original gloom, we plunge once more into a darkness that can be\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\n“The water which had collected on the balloon during its ascent now\r\nbegan to take effect, and caused it to descend with such rapidity into\r\nthe dark abyss that the ballast, which was immediately thrown overboard,\r\nwas overtaken in its descent and fell on our heads again.\r\n\r\n“I hear exclamations and voices near me. My companions are evidently\r\nagitated, and with good reason, too; for the lights which we could see a\r\nlong way below us approach with terrible rapidity. We reached the earth\r\nrather quicker than we left it.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly we feel a dreadful shock, followed by ominous crackings. The\r\ncar has grounded. The ‘Geant’ has made its descent. But in what part of\r\nthe habitable globe, and under what zone? At Meaux!”\r\n\r\nTo employ an expression of M. Nadar’s it seems that these gentlemen\r\nnever before experienced such a “knock-down blow.”\r\n\r\nAfter all these preparations, all this trouble, all the energy employed\r\nin the undertaking--sufficient, indeed, wherewith to attempt to cross\r\nthe Atlantic--to “descend at Meaux!”\r\n\r\nThe ‘Geant,’ however, had its revenge. Its second ascent gave it this\r\nrevenge. We shall be as brief as possible in relating this voyage; but\r\nthe details are all so very interesting that we regret extremely our\r\nbeing unable to give more than extracts from the narrative.\r\n\r\nOur travellers committed themselves again to the mercy of the air.\r\nThe Emperor, following the example of a former King of France, took\r\nconsiderable interest in the construction of this aerial monster, and\r\nwished the aeronaut “Bon voyage” at starting. The passengers endeavoured\r\nto pass the night as comfortably as possible, having first instituted a\r\nfour hours’ watch, as on board ship.\r\n\r\nThe aerial vessel glided rapidly through the air. “We repeatedly,” said\r\nNadar, “passed over some manufacturing centre, whose lights were not yet\r\nextinguished. I either hailed them with my speaking-trumpet or rang our\r\ntwo bells. Sometimes we received a reply from below, in the shape of a\r\nshout, for, although we still had no moon, the night was occasionally\r\nclear enough for people to distinguish us; and sometimes we heard a peal\r\nof laughter from out of the atmosphere in which we were travelling. It\r\nwas another party of aeronauts in a smaller balloon, who left at the\r\nsame time as we did, and who would persist in keeping the ‘Geant’\r\ncompany. We are passing over a small town; we hear the usual shouting\r\nand the report of a gun. Our first thoughts are--Was it loaded with shot\r\nor ball? The inhuman brute who fired will say, ‘Certainly not;’ but as\r\nballoons have often been damaged in this way, we may be confident there\r\nwas more than powder in this one. It would be satisfactory, at any rate,\r\nif the name of the person could be ascertained who favoured us with this\r\nwelcome. But it is rather late to make inquiries on this subject. It was\r\nbetween a quarter and half-past nine o’clock when this occurred. ‘The\r\nsea!’ cried Jules; ‘look at the revolving lights of the lighthouses.\r\nThere: one has just disappeared: it will flash out again in a\r\nmoment!’ But what is this? Before us, as far as our eyes can reach,\r\nwe distinguish faint lights, which in this case are neither lamps nor\r\ntorches. As we continue to draw nearer we get a better view of these\r\nnumerous, violent, and smoking furnaces. Loud and ringing sounds strike\r\non our ear at the same time. Am I right in my conjectures? Is this not\r\nthat splendid country I love more than ever now? It must be Erquelines!\r\nAnd the dignified Custom-house official, had it been possible, would\r\nhave added thereto ‘Belgium!’\r\n\r\n“We still continue to pass over fires, forges, tall chimneys, and coal\r\nmines at frequent intervals. Not long after we distinguish a large town\r\non our right hand, which, by its size and brilliant lighting by gas,\r\nwe recognise as Brussels. There could be no mistake, for close by, more\r\nmodest in size and appearance, we see Catholic Malines. We have left it\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\n“Onward! Onward! Behind us the fires fade gradually away, and disappear\r\none after another. Before us nothing at present visible. We seemed to\r\ndrift on for about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards more. We\r\ncannot distinguish a single point in front of us on which to fix our\r\ngaze. But we still continue our course in silence.\r\n\r\n“This mournful darkness, this endless shroud, in which we can discover\r\nneither rent nor spangle, still continues. Where are we? Over what\r\nstrange country, possessing neither cities, towns, nor villages, are\r\nwe hovering in the tomb-like silence of this interminable darkness? We\r\nseem, indeed, to have been carried by a puff of wind towards the west.\r\n\r\n“But something seems to approach us. What are those pale rays of light\r\nwhich we can faintly see a long, long way before us--rays pale and soft,\r\nquite unlike those flaming fires we have left behind us? Surely these\r\ndo not denote the presence of human activity! As we continue to advance,\r\nthese pale flakes of light--resembling nothing so much in appearance as\r\nmolten lead--which at first were scanty and isolated, gradually expand,\r\nand leave only narrow strips of darkness to divide them into fantastic\r\nshapes. By their help we discovered we were passing over the immense\r\nmarshes of Holland, which extended to and lost themselves in the hazy\r\nhorizon. On our right hand we hear a deep moan, still distant, but\r\nrapidly approaching every moment. It is undoubtedly the rushing of the\r\nwind. A fresh breeze for five minutes would bring us to the sea.\r\n\r\n“We experienced another shock not less formidable than the first. The\r\n‘Geant’ is trembling from its effects. The cable of our first anchor\r\nhas just broken like a piece of thread. We could not hope for a better\r\nresult. The violence of the wind which is carrying us along seems to be\r\nredoubled. A bump: another and another--then shock after shock.\r\n\r\n“‘The second dead men!’\r\n\r\n“Our swift pace was shock after shock.\r\n\r\n“‘The anchor is lost,’ cries Jules; ‘we are all dead men!\r\n\r\n“This truth is too palpable to all of us to require expressing in so\r\nmany words, for we are just commencing that furious, tearing course\r\ncalled ‘trailing.’\r\n\r\n“Our swift pace was considerably accelerated by the lower part of\r\nthe balloon, which--limp, empty, and forming nearly a third of the\r\nwhole--had been set free at the first shock, and flapped against the\r\ndistended part, acting as a sail. The shocks continued to multiply so\r\nfast that it was impossible to count them. The car continued to rebound\r\nfrom these shocks to the height of five, ten, sometimes thirty, forty,\r\nand even fifty feet, for all the world like an India-rubber ball from\r\nthe hands of an indefatigable player. Unfortunately, all our human\r\nfreight, terror stricken and without advice, had crowded into one side\r\nof the car; and as this happened to be the side on which we invariably\r\nbumped, we experienced all the worst effects of the joltings.\r\n\r\n“What a dizzy whirl! What a succession of breathless shocks! What a\r\nstrain on both muscles and nerves! By the least negligence or slip,\r\nor by the loss of presence of mind for one moment, we should have been\r\nthrown out and dashed to atoms.\r\n\r\n“Every collision tries our muscles and strains our wrists or our\r\nshoulders; and every rebound dashes us one against the other,\r\nconstituting each individual a tormentor and victim at the same time.\r\nOur flight is so rapid that we can only distinguish an occasional\r\nglimpse of anything. Far, far in the distance we distinguish an isolated\r\ntree. We approach it like lightning, and we break it as though it were a\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\n“Two terrified horses, with manes and tails erect, endeavour to fly from\r\nus. But we consume distances; we leave them behind immediately. We skip\r\nover a flock of affrighted sheep in one of our bounds. But now comes the\r\nreal danger.\r\n\r\n“At this moment, when we were perfectly benumbed with fear, and had lost\r\nall power of articulation, we saw a locomotive, drawing two carriages,\r\nrunning along an embankment at right angles to our course. A few more\r\nrevolutions of the wheels, and it will be all over with us, for we seem\r\nto be fated to meet with geometrical precision at one spot!\r\n\r\n“What will happen?\r\n\r\n“Travelling at our present hurricane pace, we shall undoubtedly lift\r\nup and overturn the machine and what it is drawing. But shall we not be\r\ncrushed ourselves? A few paces still intervene between us and our foe,\r\nand we give vent to a shout of terror.\r\n\r\n“It is heard, and the locomotive answers it by a whistle, then slackens\r\nits pace, and after seeming to hesitate an instant backs quickly and\r\nonly just in time to give us a free passage, whilst the driver, waving\r\nhis cap, salutes us with--\r\n\r\n“‘Look out for the wires!’\r\n\r\n“The caution was well timed, for we had not noticed the four telegraph\r\nwires which we rapidly approached. We energetically ducked our heads on\r\nseeing them, but fortunately we escaped any more damage than having two\r\nor three of our ropes cut. These we continued to drag after us like the\r\ntail of a ragged comet, having the telegraph-wires and the posts which\r\nlately supported them attached to us.”\r\n\r\nAfter having been dragged thus for some time at the mercy of a hurricane\r\nwhich they ought to have been able to avoid, these aerial navigators at\r\nlast got entangled in the outskirts of a wood near Rethem, in Hanover.\r\nA few broken arms and legs paid for their temerity in meddling with this\r\nmonster, and one and all of the passengers have reason to be thankful\r\nthat it will be unnecessary for us to proclaim their virtues and their\r\nfate in our next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. The Necrology of Aeronautic\r\n\r\nWe will conclude this second part by giving a brief notice of some\r\nof those who, in the early days of aerostation, fell martyrs to their\r\ndevotion to the new cause, and sometimes victims to their own want of\r\nforesight and their inexperience.\r\n\r\nFirst among these is Pilatre des Roziers, with whose courage and\r\ningenuity our readers are already familiar. After the passage of\r\nBlanchard from England over to France this hero, who was the first to\r\ntrust himself to the wide space of the sky, resolved to undertake the\r\nreturn voyage from France to England--a more difficult feat, owing to\r\nthe generally adverse character of the winds and currents. In vain did\r\nRoziers’ friends attempt to make him understand the perils to which this\r\nenterprise must expose him; his only reply was that he had discovered\r\na new balloon which united in itself all the necessary conditions of\r\nsecurity, and would permit the voyager to remain an unusually long time\r\nin the air. He asked and obtained from government the sum of 40,000\r\nlivres, in order to construct his machine. It then became clear what\r\nsort of balloon he had contrived. He united in one machine the two modes\r\npreviously made use of in aerostation. Underneath a balloon filled with\r\nhydrogen gas, he suspended a Montgolfiere, or a balloon filled with\r\nhot air from a fire. It is difficult to understand what was his precise\r\nobject in making this combination, for his ideas seem to have been\r\nconfused upon the subject. It is probable that, by the addition of a\r\nMontgolfiere, he wished to free himself from the necessity of having to\r\nthrow over ballast when he wished to ascend and to let off this gas when\r\nhe wished to descend. The fire of the Montgolfiere might, he probably\r\nsupposed, be so regulated as to enable him to rise or fall at will.\r\n\r\nThis mixed system has been justly blamed. It was simply “putting fire\r\nbeside powder,” said Professor Charles to Roziers; but the latter would\r\nnot listen, and depended for everything on his own intrepidity and\r\nscientific skill of which he had already given so many proofs. There\r\nwere, perhaps, other reasons for his unyielding obstinacy. The court\r\nthat had furnished him with the funds for the construction of the\r\nballoon pressed him, and he himself was most ambitious to equal the\r\nachievement of Blanchard, who was the first to cross the Channel, on the\r\n7th of January, 1785.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that at this time the prevailing fear in France was, that\r\nGreat Britain should bear off all the honours and profits of aerostation\r\nbefore any of these had been won by France. It was thus that with an\r\nuntried machine, and under conditions the most unfavourable for his\r\nenterprise, Roziers prepared to risk his life in this undertaking, which\r\nwas equally dangerous and useless.\r\n\r\nThe double balloon was alternately inflated and emptied. While under\r\ncover it was assailed by the rats that gnawed holes in it, and when\r\nbrought out of its place it was exposed to the tempests, so that the\r\nlonger the experiment was delayed, the worse chance there was of\r\ngetting through it successfully. At length Roziers went to Boulogne, and\r\nannounced the day of his departure; but, as if by a special Providence,\r\nhis attempt was delayed by unfavourable weather. For many weeks in\r\nsuccession the little trial balloons thrown up to show the course of the\r\nwind were driven back upon the shores of France. During all these trials\r\nthe impatient Roziers continued to chafe and torment himself.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 13th and 14th of June, 1785, the Aero-Montgolfiere\r\nremained inflated, waiting a favourable moment for departure. On the\r\n15th at four in the morning, a little pilot balloon that had been\r\nthrown up fell back on the spot from which it had been thrown free, thus\r\nshowing that there was no wind. Seven hours later Roziers, accompanied\r\nby his brother Romain, one of the constructors of the balloon, appeared\r\nin the gallery. A nobleman present threw a purse of 200 louis into the\r\ncar, and was preparing to follow it and join in the adventure. Roziers\r\nforbade him to enter, gently but firmly.\r\n\r\n“The experiment is too unsafe,” he said, “for me to expose to danger the\r\nlife of another.”\r\n\r\n“Finally,” says a narrative of the time, “the Aero-Montgolfiere rose in\r\nan imposing manner. The sound of cannon signalised the departure, the\r\nvoyagers saluted the crowd, who responded with loud shouts. The balloon\r\nadvanced until it began to traverse the sea, and every one with eyes\r\nfixed upon the fragile machine, regarded it with fear. It had traversed\r\nupwards of a league of its journey, and had reached the height of 700\r\nfeet above sea level, when a wind from the west drove it back toward the\r\nshore, after having been twenty-seven minutes in the air.\r\n\r\n“At this moment the crowd beneath perceived that the voyagers were\r\nshowing signs of alarm. They seemed suddenly to lower the grating of the\r\nMontgolfiere. But it was too late. A violet flame appeared at the top\r\nof the balloon, then spread over the whole globe, and enveloped the\r\nMontgolfiere and the voyagers. “The unfortunate men were suddenly\r\nprecipitated from the clouds to the earth, in front of the Tour de Croy,\r\nupwards of a league from Boulogne, and 300 feet from the sea beach.\r\n\r\n“The dead body of Roziers was found burnt in the gallery, many of the\r\nbones being broken. His brother was still breathing, but he was not able\r\nto speak, and in a few minutes he expired.”\r\n\r\nDe Maisonfort, who, against his own will, was left on the earth, was\r\nwitness of this sad event. He has given the following explanation of\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n“Some minutes after their departure the voyagers were assailed by\r\ncontrary winds, which drove them back again upon the land. It is\r\nprobable that then, in order to descend and seek a more favourable\r\ncurrent of air, which would take them out again to sea, Roziers opened\r\nthe valve of the gas balloon; but the cord attached to this valve\r\nwas very long, it worked with difficulty, and the friction which it\r\noccasioned tore the valve. The stuff of the balloon, which had suffered\r\nmuch from many preliminary attempts, and from other causes, was torn to\r\nthe extent of several yards, and the valve fell down inside the balloon,\r\nwhich at once emptied itself.”\r\n\r\nAccording to this narrative, there was no conflagration of the gas in\r\nthe middle of the atmosphere, nor is it stated precisely whether the\r\ngrating of the Montgolfiere was lighted.\r\n\r\nMaisonfort ran to the spot when the travellers fell, found them covered\r\nwith the cloth of the balloon, and occupying the same positions which\r\nthey had taken up on departing.\r\n\r\nBy a sad chance, that seems like irony, they were thrown down only a few\r\npaces from the monument which marks the spot where Blanchard descended.\r\nAt the present day Frenchmen going to England via Calais do not fail to\r\nvisit at the forest of Guines the monument consecrated to the expedition\r\nof Blanchard. A few paces from this monument the cicerone will point out\r\nwith his finger the spot where his rivals expired.\r\n\r\n“Such was the end of the first of aeronauts, and the most courageous of\r\nmen,” says a contemporaneous historian. “He died a martyr to honour and\r\nto zeal. His kindness, amiability, and modesty endeared him to all who\r\nknew him. She who was dearest to him--a young English lady, who boarded\r\nat a convent at Boulogne, and whom he had first met only a few days\r\nprior to his last ascent--could not support the news of his death.\r\nHorrible convulsions seized her and she expired, it is said, eight days\r\nafter the dreadful catastrophe. Roziers died at the age of twenty-eight\r\nand a half years.”\r\n\r\nOlivari perished at Orleans on the 25th of November, 1802. He had\r\nascended in a Montgolfiere made of paper, strengthened only by some\r\nbands of cloth. His car, made of osiers, and loaded with combustible\r\nmatter, was suspended below the grating; and when at a great elevation\r\nit became the prey of the flames. The aeronaut, thus deprived of his\r\nsupport, fell, at the distance of a league from the spot from which he\r\nhad risen.\r\n\r\nMosment made his last ascent at Lille on the 7th of April, 1806. His\r\nballoon was made of silk, and was filled with hydrogen gas. Ten minutes\r\nafter his departure he threw into the air a parachute with which he had\r\nprovided himself. It is supposed that the oscillations consequent on the\r\nthrowing off of the parachute were the cause of they aeronaut’s fall.\r\nSome pretend that Mosment had foretold his death, and that it was caused\r\nby a willful carelessness. However this may be, the balloon continued\r\nits flight alone, and the body of the aeronaut was found partly buried\r\nin the sand of the fosse which surrounds the town.\r\n\r\nBittorff made a great many successful ascents. He never used any machine\r\nbut the Montgolfiere. At Manheim, on the 17th of July, the day of his\r\ndeath his balloon, which was of paper, sixteen metres in diameter, and\r\ntwenty in height, took fire in the air, and the aeronaut was thrown down\r\nupon the town. His fall was mortal.\r\n\r\nHarris, an old officer of the English navy, together with another\r\nEnglish aeronaut, named Graham, had made a great many ascents. He\r\nconceived the idea of constructing a balloon upon an original plan; but\r\nhis alterations do not seem to have been improvements. In May, 1824, he\r\nattempted an ascent from London, which had much apparent success, but\r\nwhich terminated fatally. When at a great elevation, it seems, the\r\naeronaut, wishing to descend, opened the valve. It had not been well\r\nconstructed, and after being opened it would not close again. The\r\nconsequent loss of gas brought the balloon down with great force. Harris\r\nlost his life with the fall; but the young lady who had accompanied him\r\nreceived only a trifling wound.\r\n\r\nSadler, a celebrated English aeronaut, who, in one of his many\r\nexperiments, had crossed the Irish Channel between Dublin and Holyhead,\r\nlost his life miserably near Bolton, on the 28th of September, 1824.\r\nDeprived of his ballast, in consequence of his long sojourn in the air,\r\nand forced at last to descend, at a late hour, upon a number of high\r\nbuildings, the wind drove him violently against a chimney. The force of\r\nthe shock threw him out of his car, and he fell to the earth and died.\r\nHis prudence and knowledge were unquestionable, and his death is to be\r\nascribed alone to accident. It was an aerial shipwreck.\r\n\r\nCocking had gone up twice in Mr. Green’s balloon as a simple amateur.\r\nHe took it into his head to go up a third time. He wished to attempt a\r\ndescent in a parachute of his own construction, which he believed was\r\nvastly superior to the ordinary one. He altered the form altogether,\r\nthough that form had been proved to be satisfactory. In place of a\r\nconcave surface, supporting itself on a volume of air, Cocking used\r\nan inverted cone, of an elaborate construction, which, instead of\r\nsupporting him in the air, only accelerated his fall. Unhappily, Green\r\nparticipated in this experiment. The two made an ascent from Vauxhall,\r\non the 27th of September, 1836, Green having suspended Cocking’s\r\nwretched contrivance from the car of his balloon. Cocking held on by a\r\nrope, and at the height of from 1,000 to 1,200 feet the amateur,\r\nwith his patent parachute, were thrown off from the balloon. A moment\r\nafterwards Green was soaring away safely in his machine, but Cocking was\r\nlaunched into eternity.\r\n\r\n“The descent was so rapid,” says one who witnessed it, “that the mean\r\nrate of the fall was not less than twenty yards a second. In less than a\r\nminute and a half the unfortunate aeronaut was thrown to the earth, and\r\nkilled by the fall.”\r\n\r\nMadame Blanchard, thinking to improve upon Garnerin, who had decorated\r\nthe balloon which ascended in celebration of the coronation of Napoleon\r\nI. with coloured lights, fixed fireworks instead to hers. A wire rope\r\nten yards long was suspended to her car; at the bottom of this wire\r\nrope was suspended a broad disc of wood, around which the fireworks were\r\nranged. These consisted of Bengal and coloured lights. On the 6th\r\nof July, 1819, there was a great fete at Tivoli, and a multitude had\r\nassembled around the balloon of Madame Blanchard. Cannon gave the signal\r\nof departure, and soon the fireworks began to show themselves. The\r\nballoon rose splendidly, to the sound of music and the shoutings of the\r\npeople. A rain of gold and thousands of stars fell from the car as\r\nit ascended. A moment of calm succeeded, and then to the eyes of the\r\nspectators, still fixed on the balloon, an unexpected light appeared.\r\nThis light did not come from under the balloon, where the crown of\r\nfireworks was already extinguished, but shone in the car itself. It\r\nwas evident that the lady aeronaut, although now so high above the\r\nspectators, was busy about something. The light increased, then\r\ndisappeared suddenly; then appeared again, and showed itself finally at\r\nthe summit of the balloon, in the form of an immense jet of gas. The\r\ngas with which the balloon was inflated had taken fire, and the terrible\r\nglare which the light threw around was perceived from the boulevards,\r\nand all the Quartier Montmartre.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment--a frightful one for those who perceived what had\r\ntaken place--that a general sentiment of satisfaction and admiration\r\namong the spectators found vent in cries of “Brava! Vive Madame\r\nBlanchard!” &c. The people thought the lady was giving them an\r\nunexpected treat. Meantime, by the light of the flame, the balloon was\r\nseen gradually to descend. It disappeared when it reached the houses,\r\nlike a passing meteor, or a train of fire which a blast of wind suddenly\r\nextinguishes. A number of workmen and other persons, who had perceived\r\nthat some accident had taken place, ran in the direction in which the\r\nballoon appeared to descend. They arrived at a house in the Rue de\r\nProvence. On the roof of this house the balloon had fallen, and the\r\nunfortunate Madame Blanchard, thrown out of the car by the shock, was\r\nkilled by her fall to the earth.\r\n\r\nThis news spread rapidly from Tivoli, where it occasioned a stupefying\r\nsurprise. It was the first time that a fall of the kind had taken place\r\nfrom the sky at Paris. Fireworks were from this time discontinued, the\r\nfete came to an end, and a subscription was rapidly organised, producing\r\nsome thousands of francs, which shortly afterwards were employed in\r\nerecting a monument to the lady, which is now to be seen in the cemetery\r\nof Pere-la-Chaise.\r\n\r\nMadame Blanchard had wished to surpass the ordinary spectacle of an\r\naerial ascent; she had really prepared a SURPRISE for the spectators.\r\nShe had prepared and she took with her a small parachute of about\r\ntwo yards in diameter. After the extinction of the crown or star of\r\nfireworks, she intended to throw this little parachute loose; and as it\r\nwas terminated by another supply of fireworks, it was supposed that the\r\neffect would be as beautiful as surprising.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy lady was small in stature, and very light, and unfortunately\r\nmade use of a very small balloon. That of the 6th of July, 1819, was\r\nonly seven metres in diameter; and to make it ascend with the weight\r\nit carried it had to be filled to the neck with inflammable air. In\r\nquitting the earth some of this gas escaped, and rising above the\r\nballoon, formed a train like one of powder, which would certainly flash\r\ninto a blaze the moment it came in contact with the fire. But on this\r\nday it was she who with her own hand fired this train. At the moment\r\nwhen, detaching the little parachute from her car, she took the light\r\nfor the fireworks in her other hand, she crossed this train with the\r\nlight and set it on fire. Then the brave woman, throwing away the\r\nparachute and the match, strove to close the mouth of the balloon, and\r\nto stifle the fire. These efforts being unavailing, Madame Blanchard was\r\ndistinctly seen to sit down in her car and await her fate.\r\n\r\nThe burning of the hydrogen lasted several minutes, during which time\r\nthe balloon gradually descended. Had it not been that it struck on the\r\nroof of the house Madame Blanchard would have been saved. At the moment\r\nof the shock she was heard to cry out, “A moi.” These were her last\r\nwords. The car, going along the roof of the house, was caught by an\r\niron bar and overturned, and the lady was thrown head foremost upon the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the ground she immediately expired. Her head and\r\nshoulders were slightly burnt, otherwise she exhibited no marks of the\r\nfire which had destroyed the balloon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. Scientific Experiments--Applications of Ballooning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. Experiments of Robertson, Lhoest, Saccarof, &c.\r\n\r\nRobertson is regarded by many as a sort of mountebank; yet such men as\r\nArago have put themselves to the trouble of examining the aerostatic\r\nfeats of this aeronaut, and of examining the results of his\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n“The savant Robertson,” says Arago, “performed at Hamburg on the 18th\r\nof July, 1803, with his countryman, Lhoest, the first aeronautic voyage\r\nfrom which science has been able to draw useful deductions. The two\r\naeronauts remained suspended in the air during five hours, and came\r\ndown near Hanover, twenty-five leagues from the spot from which they set\r\noff.”\r\n\r\nThe first time that Robertson appears in the annals of aerostation is in\r\n1802, on the occasion of the sale of the balloon used at the battle\r\nof Fleurus, of which mention will be made in the chapter on military\r\naerostation. But three years previously he had been instructed to make\r\na balloon of an original form, which should ascend in honour of the\r\nTurkish ambassador at the garden of Tivoli. The fete was completely\r\nsuccessful. Turks, Chinese, Persians, and Bedouins will always be\r\nwelcome, as on this occasion, at Paris, appearing as they do only at\r\nrare intervals, and for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe fete took place on the 2nd of July. Robertson presented himself at\r\nthe house of Esseid-Ali, to obtain his autograph. The Turkish ambassador\r\nwillingly granted the request, and wrote his name in letters, each of\r\nwhich was two inches in height, on a sheet of paper. He then offered the\r\naeronaut coffee and comfits, and promised to be present to witness the\r\nballoon ascent. His name was painted in large characters on a balloon\r\nfifteen feet in diameter, and on the form of which was the figure of a\r\ncrescent. The experiment delighted the ambassador, and was well received\r\nby the public.\r\n\r\nJacques Garnerin, when he came to make his debut as an aeronaut, made an\r\nattempt with the parachute, the following August, at the garden of the\r\nHotel de Biron. The ambassador was asked to honour the fete, but he\r\ndeclined, saying that he had “made up his mind that man was not intended\r\nfor flying--Mahomet had not so willed it.”\r\n\r\nOf one of Robertson’s more interesting ascents he himself has left us\r\nthe following sketch:--\r\n\r\n“I rose in the balloon at nine a.m., accompanied by my fellow-student\r\nand countryman, M. Lhoest. We had 140 lbs. of ballast. The barometer\r\nmarked twenty-eight inches; the thermometer sixteen degrees Reaumur. In\r\nspite of some slight wind from the north-west, the balloon mounted so\r\nperpendicularly that in all the streets each of the spectators believed\r\nwe were mounting straight up above his head. In order to quicken our\r\nascent I discharged a parachute made of silk, and weighted in a way to\r\nprevent oscillations. The parachute descended at the rate of two feet\r\nper second, and its descent was uniform. From the moment when the\r\nbarometer began to sink we became very careful of our ballast, as we\r\nwished to test from experience the different temperatures through which\r\nwe were about to pass.\r\n\r\n“At 10.15, the barometer was at nineteen inches, and the thermometer\r\nat three above zero. We now felt all the inconvenience of an extremely\r\nrarefied atmosphere coming upon us, and we commenced to arrange some\r\nexperiments in atmospheric electricity. Our first attempts did not\r\nsucceed. We threw over part of our ballast, and mounted up till the\r\ncold and the rarefaction of the air became very troublesome. During\r\nour experiments we experienced an illness throughout our whole system.\r\nBuzzing in the cars commenced, and went on increasing. The pain we felt\r\nwas like that which one feels when he plunges his head in water. Our\r\nchests seemed to be dilated, and failed in elasticity. My pulse was\r\nquickened, M. Lhoest’s became slower; he had, like me, swelled lips and\r\nbleeding eyes; the veins seemed to come out more strongly on the hands.\r\nThe blood ran to the head, and occasioned a feeling as if our hats were\r\ntoo tight. The thermometer continued to descend, and, as we ascended,\r\nour illness increased, and we could with difficulty keep awake. Fearing\r\nthat my travelling companion might go to sleep, I attached a cord to my\r\nthigh and to his, and we held the extremities of the cord in our hands.\r\nThus trammelled, we had to commence the experiments which I had proposed\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n“At this elevation, the glass, the brimstone, and the Spanish wax were\r\nnot electrified in a manner to show any signs under friction--at least,\r\nI obtained no electricity from the conductors or the electrometer.\r\n\r\n“I had in my car a voltaic pile, consisting of sixty couples--silver\r\nand zinc. It worked very well on the occasion of our departure from the\r\nearth, and gave, without the condenser, one degree to the electrometer.\r\nAt our great elevation, the pile gave only five-sixths of a degree to\r\nthe same electrometer. The galvanic flame seemed more active at this\r\nelevation than on the earth.\r\n\r\n“I took two birds with me on coming into the balloon--one of these was\r\nnow dead, the other appeared stupefied. After having placed it upon the\r\nbrink of the gondola, I tried to frighten it to make it take to flight.\r\nIt moved its wings, but did not leave the spot; then I left it to\r\nitself, and it fell perpendicularly and with great rapidity. Birds are\r\ncertainly not able to maintain themselves at such elevations.\r\n\r\n“It is notable that the atmosphere, which was of a perfect purity near\r\nthe earth, was grey and misty above our heads, and the beautiful blue\r\nsky seen from the surface did not exist for us, although the weather was\r\ncalm and serene, and the day the most beautiful that could be. The sun\r\ndid not seem dazzling to us, and its heat was diminished owing to our\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n“At half-past eleven, the balloon was no longer visible from Hamburg.\r\nThe heavens were so pure beneath us that everything was distinctly seen\r\nby us, though very much diminished by distance. At 11.40, the town of\r\nHamburg seemed only a red point in our eyes; the Elbe looked like\r\na straight ribbon. I wished to make use of an opera-glass, but what\r\nsurprised me was that when I lifted it up it was so cold that I had to\r\nwrap my handkerchief around it to enable me to hold it.\r\n\r\n“Not being able to support our position any longer, we descended, after\r\nhaving used up much gas and ballast. Our descent caused that degree\r\nof terror among the inhabitants which the size of our balloon was\r\ncalculated to inspire in a country where such machines had never before\r\nbeen seen. We descended above a poor village called Radenburg, a place\r\namid the heaths of Hanover. Our appearance caused great alarm, and even\r\nthe beasts of the field fled from us.\r\n\r\n“While our balloon rapidly approached the earth, we waved our hats and\r\nflags, and shouted to the inhabitants, but our voices only increased\r\ntheir terror. The villagers rushed away with cries of terror, leaving\r\ntheir herds, whose bellowings increased the general alarm. When the\r\nballoon touched the ground, every man had shut himself up in his own\r\nhouse. Having appealed in vain, and fearing that the villagers might do\r\nus some injury, we resolved to re-ascend.\r\n\r\n“In making this second ascent, we threw over all our ballast; but in\r\nthis we were imprudent, for after sailing about at a great height, and\r\nhaving lost much gas, I perceived that our descent would be very\r\nrapid, and to provide against accident, I gathered together all the\r\ninstruments, the bread, the ropes, and even such money as we had with\r\nus, and placed them in three sacks, to which I attached a rope of a\r\nhundred feet in length. This precaution saved us a shock. The weight,\r\namounting to thirty pounds, reached the ground before us, and the\r\nballoon, thus lightened, came softly to the ground between Wichtenbech\r\nand Hanover, after having run twenty-five leagues in five and a half\r\nhours.”\r\n\r\nAfter this ascent Robertson became acquainted with some savants of\r\nHamburg, and amongst others with Professor Pfaff, who was interested\r\nin aerial travelling as a means of settling certain meteorological\r\nproblems. Some days after Robertson’s ascent, the professor wrote to\r\nhim--\r\n\r\n“You speak of a certain height at which the hydrogen gas will find\r\nitself in equilibrium in the air of the atmosphere. I believe that this\r\nheight is the extremity of the atmosphere itself; for as the gas has an\r\nelasticity much greater than that of the air, it will go on dilating as\r\nit mounts into the higher regions of the atmosphere, and its specific\r\nweight will diminish as the weight of atmospheric air diminishes; and it\r\nwill not cease to mount until it rises above the atmosphere itself, if\r\ntwo conditions be completely fulfilled--1, the condition that the gas\r\nmay be allowed to dilate without leaving the balloon as it rises; 2,\r\nthe condition that the gas shall not be allowed to mix at all with the\r\natmospheric air.”\r\n\r\nAnother ascent was arranged for the 14th of August, in which Robertson\r\nwas to be accompanied by the professor, but the latter, yielding to the\r\nentreaties of his family, did not go. “I went up with my friend Lhoest,”\r\n says Robertson, “at forty-two minutes past twelve midday. In a minute or\r\ntwo we rose up between two masses of cloud, which seemed to open up and\r\noffer us a passage. The upper surfaces of these clouds are not uniformly\r\nlevel, like the under sides seen from the earth, but they are of a\r\nconical or pyramidal shape. These imposing masses seem to precipitate\r\nthemselves upon the earth, as if to engulf it, but this optical illusion\r\nwas due to the apparent immobility of the balloon, which at the moment\r\nwas rising at the rate of about twenty feet per second.\r\n\r\n“The fear of losing the view of the Baltic, which we perceived between\r\nthe clouds at intervals, obliged us to renounce the project of rising as\r\nhigh as on the last occasion. The barometer was at fifteen inches, and\r\nthe thermometer one degree below zero, when I let off two pigeons.\r\n\r\n“One descended in a diagonal direction, its wings half open but not\r\nmoving, with a swiftness which seemed that of a fall. The other flew\r\nfor an instant, and then placed itself upon the car, and did not wish to\r\nquit us. Acting on the hint of Dr. Reimarus, I tried the same experiment\r\nwith butterflies, but the air was too much rarefied for them; they\r\nattempted in vain to raise themselves by their wings, but they did not\r\nforsake the car.\r\n\r\n“The wind continuing to carry me towards the sea, I resolved to bring\r\nmy observations to an end. I effected my descent in a meadow, near the\r\nvillage of Rehorst, in Holstein, after having run sixteen leagues from\r\nFrance in sixty-five minutes.”\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the year 1804, Laplace, at the Institute,\r\nproposed to take advantage of the means offered by aerostation to verify\r\nat great heights certain scientific points--as, for example, those which\r\nconcern magnetism. This proposition was made at a favourable time, and\r\nwas, so far, carried out in the best possible way. The aeronauts who\r\nwere appointed to carry out the expedition were Biot and Gay-Lussac, the\r\nmost enthusiastic aeronauts of the period.\r\n\r\nThe following is their report:--\r\n\r\n“We observed the animals we had with us at all the different heights,\r\nand they did not appear to suffer in any manner. For ourselves, we\r\nperceived no effect any more then a quickening of the pulse. At 10,000\r\nfeet above the ground we set a little green-finch at liberty. He flew\r\nout at once, but immediately returning, settled upon our cordage;\r\nafterwards, setting out again, he flew to the earth, describing a very\r\ntortuous line in his passage. We followed him with our eyes till he was\r\nlost in the clouds. A pigeon, which we set free at the same elevation,\r\npresented a very curious spectacle. Placed at liberty on the edge of the\r\ncar, he remained at rest for a number of instants, as if measuring the\r\nlength of his flight; then he launched himself into space, flying about\r\nirregularly, as if to try his wings. Afterwards he began his descent\r\nregularly, sweeping round and round in great circles, ever reaching\r\nlower, until he also was lost in the clouds.”\r\n\r\nAs to the voyagers themselves, this is how they speak of their situation\r\nat the height of 3,000 yards:--\r\n\r\n“About this elevation we observed our animals. They did not appear\r\nto suffer from the rarity of the air, yet the barometer was at twenty\r\ninches eight lines.. We were much surprised that we did not suffer from\r\nthe cold; on the contrary, the sun warmed us much. We had thrown aside\r\nthe gloves which had been put on board, and which were of no use to us.\r\nOur pulses were very quick; that of M. Gay-Lussac, which is 62 in the\r\nminute on ordinary occasions, now gave 80; and mine, which is ordinarily\r\n89, gave 111. This acceleration was felt by both of us in nearly the\r\nsame proportion. Nevertheless, our respiration was in no way interfered\r\nwith, we experienced no illness, and our situation seemed to us\r\nextremely agreeable.”\r\n\r\nThe following is their report to the Galvanic Society--\r\n\r\n“We have known for a long time that no animal can with safety pass into\r\nan atmosphere much more dense or much more rare than that to which it\r\nhas been accustomed. In the first case it suffers from the outer air,\r\nwhich presses upon it severely; in the second case there are liquids or\r\nfluids in the animal’s body which, being less pressed against than\r\nthey should be, become dilated, and press against their coverings or\r\nchannels. In both cases the symptoms are nearly the same--pain, general\r\nillness, buzzing in the ears, and even haemorrhage. The experience of\r\nthe diving-bell has long made us familiar with what aeronauts suffer.\r\nOur colleague (Robertson), and his companion, have experienced these\r\neffects in great intensity. They had swelled lips, their eyes bled,\r\ntheir veins were dilated, and, what is very remarkable, they both\r\npreserved a brown or red tinge which astonished those that had seen them\r\nbefore they made the ascent. This distension of the blood-vessels would\r\nnecessarily produce an inconvenience and a difficulty in the muscular\r\naction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. Ascent of M. Gay-Lussac Alone--Excursions of MM. Barral and\r\nBixio.\r\n\r\nRespecting this ascent, Arago states that M. Gay-Lussac has reduced to\r\ntheir proper value the narratives of the physical pains which aeronauts\r\nsay they suffer in lofty aerial ascents.\r\n\r\nM. Gay-Lussac says:--“Having arrived at the most elevated point of\r\nmy ascent, 21,000 feet above sea level, my respiration was rendered\r\nsensibly difficult, but I was far from experiencing any illness of a\r\nkind to make me descend. My pulse and my breathing were very quick;\r\nbreathing very frequently in an extremely dry atmosphere, I should not\r\nhave been surprised if my throat had been so dry as to make it painful\r\nto swallow bread.”\r\n\r\nAfter having finished his observations, which referred chiefly to the\r\nmagnetic needle, with all the tranquillity of a doctor in his study,\r\nGay-Lussac descended to the earth between Rouen and Dieppe, eighty\r\nleagues from Paris.\r\n\r\nAfter the names of Robertson, Gay-Lussac, and Biot, science has\r\nregistered those of Barral and Bixio, two men whose aeronautic\r\nachievements have enriched meteorology with more important discoveries,\r\nperhaps, than any we have yet mentioned.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen had conceived the project of rising by means of a\r\nballoon to a great height, in order to study, with the assistance of the\r\nvery best instruments in use in their day, a multitude of phenomena then\r\nimperfectly known. The subjects to which they were specially to direct\r\ntheir attention, were the law of the decrease of temperature in progress\r\nupwards, the discovery of whether the chemical composition of the\r\natmosphere is the same throughout all its parts, the comparison of the\r\nstrength of the solar rays in the higher regions of the atmosphere\r\nand on the surface of the earth, the ascertaining whether the light\r\nreflected and transmitted by the clouds is or is not polarised, &c.\r\n\r\nAll the preparations having been made in the garden of the Observatory\r\nat Paris, the ascent took place on the 29th of June, 1850, at 10.27\r\na.m., the balloon being filled with hydrogen gas. The first ascent was a\r\nsignal failure. It was found that the weather being bad, the envelope\r\nof the balloon was torn in several places, and had to be mended in all\r\nhaste. Immediately preceding the moment of ascent, a torrent of rain\r\nfell. But the voyagers were determined to ascend. They placed themselves\r\nin the car, and, when thrown off from the fastenings, they rose through\r\nthe air with the speed of an arrow. The height to which the balloon\r\nreached made it suddenly dilate, and the network, which was much too\r\nsmall, was stretched to the utmost. The balloon was forced down upon\r\nthem by the dilation, and one of them, in the endeavour to work the\r\nvalve, made a rent in the lower part of the globe, from which the gas\r\nescaping almost over the heads of the travellers, nearly choked them.\r\nThe escape of the gas had the usual result--the balloon descended\r\nrapidly, and fell in a vineyard near Lugny, where they were found by\r\nthe peasants holding on to the trees by their legs and arms, and thus\r\nattempting to stop the horizontal advance of the car. They had risen to\r\nthe height of over 17,000 feet, and they had descended from this height\r\nin from four to five minutes.\r\n\r\nFor all practical purposes, the ascent was a failure, and the aeronauts\r\nimmediately commenced preparations for a new voyage, which took place a\r\nmonth afterwards. They rose to very great altitudes, but experienced no\r\nillness from the rarefied air. M. Bixio did not feel the sharp pains in\r\nthe ears from which he had suffered on the former occasion. They passed\r\nthrough a mass of cloud 15,000 feet in thickness, and they had not yet\r\npassed quite through it, when at the height of over 21,000 feet from the\r\nground, they began to descend, their descent being caused by a rent in\r\nthe envelope of the balloon, from which the gas escaped. They might, in\r\nthrowing out the last of their ballast, have, perhaps, prolonged for a\r\nlittle their sojourn in space, but the circumstances in which they were\r\nplaced did not permit them to make many more scientific observations\r\nthan those they had made, and thus they were obliged to submit to their\r\nfate. When they had reached their greatest height, there seemed to open\r\nup in the midst of the vaporous mass a brilliant space, from which they\r\ncould see the blue of heaven. The polariscope, directed towards this\r\nregion, showed an internal polarisation, but, when pointed to the side\r\nwhere the mist still prevailed, there was no polarisation.\r\n\r\nAn optical phenomenon of a remarkable kind was witnessed when the\r\nvoyagers had attained their highest point. They saw the sun through the\r\nupper mists, looking quite white, as if shorn of its strength; and, at\r\nthe same time, below the horizontal plane, below their horizon, and at\r\nan angular distance from the plane equal to that of the sun above it,\r\nthey saw a second sun, which resembled the reflection of the actual sun\r\nin a sheet of water. It is natural to suppose that the second sun was\r\nformed by the reflection of the sun’s rays upon the horizontal faces of\r\nthe ice crystals floating in this high cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. Ascents of the Mssrs. Welsh, Glaisher and Coxwell.\r\n\r\nThe most recent balloon ascents in England deserving attention have been\r\nundertaken for scientific objects, and in this country, more than in\r\nany other, it may be said that the conquest of the air has been made to\r\nserve a practical end.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1852, the Committee of the Kew Observatory resolved to\r\nundertake a number of balloon voyages. This resolution was approved\r\nof by the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and the\r\nnecessary instruments for making a number of meteorological observations\r\nwere prepared. The balloon employed was that of Mr. Green, who was\r\naccompanied in his ascents by Mr. Welsh. The greatest height to which\r\nMr. Welsh rose was on the fourth ascent which took place on the 10th of\r\nNovember, 1852. The balloon rose 22,930 feet, and the lowest temperature\r\nobserved was 26 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nIt is to Mr. Glaisher and Mr. Coxwell, however, that the highest\r\nhonours of scientific aerostation belong. The ascents made by these\r\ngentlemen--Mr. Glaisher being the scientific observer, and Mr. Coxwell\r\nthe practical aeronaut--have become matters of history. Not only did\r\nthey, in the course of a large number of ascents undertaken under the\r\nauspices of the British Association, succeed in gathering much valuable\r\nmeteorological information, but they reached a greater height than that\r\never gained on any previous or subsequent occasion, and penetrated into\r\nthat distant region of the skies in which it has been satisfactorily\r\nproved that no life can be long maintained. It was on the 5th of\r\nSeptember, 1862, that Mr. Glaisher and Mr. Coxwell made the famous\r\nascent in which they reached the greatest height ever attained by an\r\naeronaut, and were so nearly sacrificed to their unselfish daring. Mr.\r\nGlaisher has given an admirable account of this ascent, which took place\r\nfrom Wolverhampton. He says:--“Our ascent had been delayed, owing to the\r\nunfavourable state of the weather. It commenced at three minutes past\r\none p.m., the temperature of the air being 59 degrees, and the dew-point\r\n48 degrees. At the height of one mile the temperature was 41 degrees\r\nand the dew-point 38 degrees. Shortly after wards clouds were entered\r\nof about 1,100 feet in thickness. Upon emerging from them at seventeen\r\nminutes past one, I tried to take a view of their surface with the\r\ncamera, but the balloon was ascending too rapidly and spiraling too\r\nquickly to allow me to do so. The height of two miles was reached at\r\ntwenty-one minutes past one. The temperature of the air had fallen to\r\n32 degrees and the dew-point to 26 degrees. The third mile was passed\r\nat twenty-eight minutes past one, with an air temperature of 18 degrees,\r\nand a dew-point of 13 degrees. The fourth mile was passed at thirty-nine\r\nminutes past one, with an air temperature of 8 degrees, and a dew-point\r\nof minus 6 degrees and the fifth mile about ten minutes later, with an\r\nair temperature minus 5 degrees, and a dew-point minus 36 degrees.\r\n\r\n“Up to this time I had experienced no particular inconvenience. When at\r\nthe height of 26,000 feet I could not see the fine column of the mercury\r\nin the tube; then the fine divisions on the scale of the instrument\r\nbecame invisible. At that time I asked Mr. Coxwell to help me to read\r\nthe instruments, as I experienced a difficulty in seeing them. In\r\nconsequence of the rotary motion of the balloon, which had continued\r\nwithout ceasing since the earth was left, the valve line had become\r\ntwisted, and he had to leave the car, and to mount into the ring above\r\nto adjust it. At that time I had no suspicion of other than temporary\r\ninconvenience in seeing. Shortly afterwards I laid my arm upon the\r\ntable, possessed of its full vigour; but directly after, being\r\ndesirous of using it, I found it powerless. It must have lost its power\r\nmomentarily. I then tried to move the other arm, but found it powerless\r\nalso. I next tried to shake myself, and succeeded in shaking my body. I\r\nseemed to have no legs. I could only shake my body. I then looked at the\r\nbarometer, and whilst I was doing so my head fell on my left shoulder. I\r\nstruggled, and shook my body again, but could not move my arms. I got\r\nmy head upright, but for an instant only, when it fell on my right\r\nshoulder; and then I fell backwards, my back resting against the side of\r\nthe car, and my head on its edge. In that position my eyes were directed\r\ntowards Mr. Coxwell in the ring. When I shook my body I seemed to have\r\nfull power over the muscles of the back, and considerable power over\r\nthose of the neck, but none over my limbs. As in the case of the arms,\r\nall muscular power was lost in an instant from my back and neck. I dimly\r\nsaw Mr. Coxwell in the ring, and endeavoured to speak, but could not\r\ndo so; when in an instant intense black darkness came over me, and the\r\noptic nerve lost power suddenly. I was still conscious, with as active a\r\nbrain as whilst writing this. I thought I had been seized with asphyxia,\r\nand that I should experience no more, as death would come unless we\r\nspeedily descended. Other thoughts were actively entering my mind when I\r\nsuddenly became unconscious, as though going to sleep. I could not\r\ntell anything about the sense of hearing: the perfect stillness of the\r\nregions six miles from the earth--and at that time we were between six\r\nand seven miles high--is such that no sound reaches the ear. My last\r\nobservation was made at 29,000 feet, about fifty-four minutes past\r\none. I suppose two or three minutes elapsed between my eyes becoming\r\ninsensible to seeing the fine divisions and fifty-four minutes past one,\r\nand that other two or three minutes elapsed before I became unconscious;\r\ntherefore I think that took place about fifty-six or fifty-seven\r\nminutes past one. Whilst powerless I heard the words ‘temperature,’ and\r\n‘observation,’ and I knew Mr. Coxwell was in the car, speaking to me,\r\nand endeavouring to rouse me; and therefore consciousness and hearing\r\nhad returned. I then heard him speak more emphatically, but I could not\r\nspeak or move. Then I heard him say, ‘Do try; now do!’ Then I saw the\r\ninstruments dimly, next Mr. Coxwell, and very shortly I saw clearly. I\r\nrose in my seat and looked round, as though waking from sleep, and said\r\nto Mr. Coxwell, ‘I have been insensible.’ He said, ‘Yes; and I too, very\r\nnearly.’ I then drew up my legs, which had been extended out before\r\nme, and took a pencil in my hand to note my observations. Mr. Coxwell\r\ninformed me that he had lost the use of his hands, which were black, and\r\nI poured brandy over them. I resumed my observations at seven minutes\r\npast two. I suppose three or four minutes were occupied from the time of\r\nmy hearing the words ‘temperature’ and ‘observation,’ until I began to\r\nobserve. If so, then returning consciousness came at four minutes past\r\ntwo, and that gives about seven minutes of total insensibility. Mr.\r\nCoxwell told me that in coming from the ring he thought for a moment\r\nthat I had laid back to rest myself; that he spoke to me without\r\neliciting a reply; that he then noticed that my legs projected, and my\r\narms hung down by my side. That my countenance was serene and placid,\r\nwithout earnestness or anxiety, he had noticed before going into the\r\nring. It then struck him that I was insensible. He wished then to\r\napproach me, but could not, and he felt insensibility coming over\r\nhimself. He became anxious to open the valve, but, in consequence of\r\nhaving lost the use of his hands, he could not; and ultimately he did\r\nso by seizing the cord with his teeth and dipping his head two or three\r\ntimes. No inconvenience followed our insensibility. When we dropped it\r\nwas in a country where no accommodation of any kind could be obtained,\r\nso that we had to walk between seven and eight miles. At the time of\r\nceasing our observations the ascent was at the rate of 1,000 feet per\r\nminute, and on resuming observations the descent was at the rate of\r\n2,000 feet per minute. These two positions must be connected, having\r\nrelation to the interval of time which elapsed between them; and they\r\ncan scarcely be connected at a point less than 36,000 or 37,000 feet\r\nhigh. Again, a very delicate minimum thermometer was found to read\r\nminus 12 degrees, and that reading would indicate an elevation exceeding\r\n36,000 feet. There cannot be any doubt that the balloon attained the\r\ngreat height of seven miles--the greatest ever reached. In this ascent\r\nsix pigeons were taken up. One was thrown out at three miles. It\r\nextended its wings, and dropped like a piece of paper. A second at four\r\nmiles, and it flew with vigour. A third between four and five miles, and\r\nit fell downwards. A fourth was thrown out at four miles in descending,\r\nand it alighted on the top of the balloon. Two were brought to the\r\nground. One was dead, and the other was ill, but recovered so as to fly\r\naway in a quarter of an hour.”\r\n\r\nThe results gathered by Mr. Glaisher from his numerous ascents are very\r\ninteresting. He found that in no instance did the temperature of the air\r\ndecrease uniformly with the increase of height. In fact, the decrease\r\nin the first mile is double that in the second, and nearly four times as\r\ngreat as the change of temperature in the fifth mile. The distribution\r\nof aqueous vapour in the air is no less remarkable. The temperature\r\nof the dew-point on leaving the earth decreases less rapidly than\r\nthe temperature of the air; so that the difference between the two\r\ntemperatures becomes less and less, till the vapour or cloud plane is\r\nreached, when they are usually together, and always most nearly approach\r\neach other, and that point is usually at about the height of one mile.\r\nOn leaving the upper surface of cloud, the dew point decreases more\r\nrapidly than the air, and at extremely high situations the difference\r\nbetween the two temperatures is wonderfully great, indicating an\r\nextraordinary degree of dryness, and an almost entire absence of water.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the presence of cirrus clouds far above this\r\ndry region, apparently as much above as when viewed from the earth, is\r\nvery remarkable, and leads to the conclusion that they are not composed\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nIn the propagation of sound, M. Glaisher made many curious experiments.\r\nIn one ascent (July 17th) he found, when at a distance of 11,800 feet\r\nabove the earth, that a band was heard; at a height of 22,000 feet, a\r\nclap of thunder was heard; and at a height of 10,070 feet, the report of\r\na gun was heard. On one occasion, he heard the dull hum of London at\r\na height of 9,000 feet above the city, and on another occasion, the\r\nshouting of many thousands of persons could not be heard at the height\r\nof 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. Balloons Made Useful in Warfare.\r\n\r\n     Wars of the French Republic--Company of “Ballooneers”--\r\n     Battle of Fleurus--The Balloons of Egypt--Napoleon--Modern\r\n     Services War in Italy--War in America--Conclusion.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude our work with a glance at aerostation as applied to\r\nwarfare. Scarcely had the first ascents astonished the world, than the\r\nmore adventurous spirits began to use the new discovery for a thousand\r\npurposes directly useful to man. The first point of view in which\r\naerostation was regarded, was in that of its practical utility If one\r\nrefers to the pre-occupations of the time--to the great events then\r\noccurring in the history of France, one will easily understand that the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety soon thought of employing balloons in the\r\nobservation of the forces and the movements of hostile troops. In\r\n1794, the idea was practically carried out, and the French armies were\r\nprovided with two companies of aeronauts. The command of one of these\r\ncompanies was given to Captain Coutelle, a young physicist of great\r\ntalent, who rendered memorable services at the battle of Fleurus. The\r\nballoons were not thrown free, but were retained attached by means\r\nof long cords. In this way they took up, so to speak, aerial posts of\r\nobservation. Placed in his car, the captain transmitted his instructions\r\nto his men below by means of coloured flags. Coutelle has left us a\r\nlively narrative of certain incidents connected with one of the grand\r\ndays of the old Republic. He had been commissioned by the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety to go to Maubeuge, where Jourdan’s army was encamped,\r\nand to offer him the use of his balloon. The representative to whom the\r\nyoung doctor presented his commission, knew nothing about balloons,\r\nand not being able to understand the order of the Committee of Public\r\nSafety, it suddenly dawned upon him that Coutelle, with his trumpery\r\nforgery about balloons, was nothing else than a spy, and he was about to\r\nhave him shot. The genuineness of the order from the Committee, however,\r\nwas proved, and Coutelle’s case was listened to.\r\n\r\n“The army was at Beaumont,” says Coutelle, “and the enemy, placed at a\r\ndistance of only three miles, could attack at any moment. The general\r\ntold me this fact, and engaged me to return and communicate it to the\r\nCommittee. This I did. The Commission then felt the necessity of making\r\nan experiment with a balloon that could raise two persons, and the\r\nminister placed at my service the garden and the little mansion of\r\nMeudon. Many of the members of the Commission came to witness the first\r\nascent of a balloon held in hand, like a kite, by means of two cords.\r\nThe Commissioners ordered me to place myself in the car, and instructed\r\nme as to a number of signals which I must repeat, and observations which\r\nI must make. I raised myself to the full length of the cord, a height\r\nof 1,500 feet, and at this height, with the help of a glass, I could\r\ndistinctly see the seven bends of the river Seine. On returning to the\r\nearth, I received the compliments of the Commission.\r\n\r\n“Arrived at Maubeuge, my first care was to find a suitable spot to erect\r\nmy furnace, and to make every preparation for the arrival of my balloon\r\nfrom Meudon. Each day my observations contained something new either in\r\nthe works which the Austrians had thrown up during the night, or in the\r\narrangement of their forces. On the fifth day a piece of cannon had been\r\nbrought to bear upon the balloon, and shots were fired at me as soon as\r\nI appeared above the ramparts. None of the shots took effect, and on the\r\nfollowing day the piece was no longer in position. Experience enforced\r\nupon me the necessity of forming some provision against these unexpected\r\nattacks. I employed the night in fixing cords all round the middle of my\r\nballoon. Each of the aerostiers had charge of one of the ropes, and\r\nby means of them I could easily move about, and thus get myself out\r\nof range of any gun that had been trained to bear against me. I was\r\nafterwards ordered to make a reconnaissance at Mayence, and I posted\r\nmyself between our lines and the enemy at half range of cannon. When the\r\nwind, which was tempestuous at first, became calmer, I was able to count\r\nthe number of cannon on the ramparts, as well as the troops that marched\r\nthrough the streets and in the squares.\r\n\r\n“Generally the soldiers of the enemy, all who saw the observer watching\r\nthem and taking notes, came to the idea that they could do nothing\r\nwithout being seen. Our soldiers were of the same opinion, and\r\nconsequently they regarded us with great admiration and trust. On the\r\nheavy marches they brought us prepared food and wine, which my men were\r\nhardly able to get for themselves, so closely did they require to attend\r\nto the ropes. We were encamped upon the banks of the Rhine at Manheim\r\nwhen our general sent me to the opposite bank to parley. As soon as the\r\nAustrian officers were made aware that I commanded the balloon, I was\r\noverwhelmed with questions and compliments.\r\n\r\n“What causes an impression which, till one is accustomed to it, is very\r\nalarming, is the noise which the balloon makes when it is struck by\r\nsuccessive gales of wind. When the wind has passed, the balloon, which\r\nhas been pressed into a concave form by the wind, suddenly resumes its\r\nglobular form with a loud noise heard at a great distance. The silk of\r\nthe balloon would often burst in a case of this kind, were it not for\r\nthe restraining power of the network.”\r\n\r\nAfter the days of Coutelle we do not read that balloons were made much\r\nuse of in warfare. The only ascent in the Egypt campaign was that of\r\na tricolor balloon thrown up to commemorate a fete. That Napoleon knew\r\nfull well the value of the scientific discoveries of his time is clear\r\nfrom the following conversation with a learned Mohammedan, which took\r\nplace in the great pyramid of Cheops:--\r\n\r\nMussamed. “Noble successor of Alexander, honour to shine invincible\r\narms, and to the unexpected lightning with which your warriors are\r\nfurnished.”\r\n\r\nBonaparte. “Do you believe that that lightning is the work of the\r\nchildren of men? Allah has placed it in our hands by means of the genius\r\nof war.”\r\n\r\nMussamed. “We recognised by your arms that it is Allah that has sent\r\nyou--the Delta and all the neighbouring countries are full of thy\r\nmiracles. But would you be a conqueror if Allah did not permit you?”\r\n\r\nBonaparte. “A celestial body will point by my orders to the dwelling of\r\nthe clouds, and lightning will descend towards the earth, along a rod of\r\nmetal from which I can call it forth.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon did not favour the use of balloons in war. Perhaps it was\r\nbecause he himself had such a splendid genius for war that he depended\r\nalone upon himself, and scorned assistance. Perhaps it was because if\r\nballoons were discovered to be of real utility, his enemies might make\r\nuse of them as well as himself, and France retain no special advantage\r\nin them. But however this may be, on his return from Egypt he sold\r\nthe balloon of Fleurus to Robertson. The company of ballooneers was\r\ndissolved, and the balloons themselves disappeared in smoke.\r\n\r\nDuring the war in America, the role which the balloon played was a more\r\nimportant one. The Government of the United States conferred the title\r\nof aeronautic engineer upon Mr. Allan, of Rhode Island, who originated\r\nthe idea of communicating by a telegraphic wire from the balloon to\r\nthe camp. The first telegraphic message which was transmitted from\r\nthe aerial regions is that of Professor Love, at Washington, to the\r\nPresident of the United States. The following is this despatch:--\r\n\r\n“WASHINGTON, Balloon the ‘Enterprise.’\r\n\r\n“SIR,--The point of observation commands an extent of nearly fifty miles\r\nin diameter. The city, with its girdle of encampments, presents a superb\r\nscene. I have great pleasure in sending you this despatch--the first\r\nthat has been telegraphed from an aerial station--and to know that I\r\nshould be so much encouraged, from having given the first proof that the\r\naeronautic science can render great assistance in these countries.”\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, 1861, one of the most hardy aeronauts (La\r\nMountain) furnished important information to General M’Clellan. The\r\nballoon of La Mountain, which arose from the northern camp upon the\r\nPotomac, passed above Washington. La Mountain then cut the cord that\r\nconnected his balloon with the earth, and rising rapidly to the height\r\nof a mile and a half, he found himself directly above his enemies’\r\nlines. There he was able to observe perfectly their position and their\r\nmovements. He then threw over ballast, and ascended to the height of\r\nthree miles. At this height he encountered a current which carried him\r\nin the direction of Maryland, where he descended in safety. General\r\nM’Clellan was so much satisfied with the observations taken in the\r\nballoon, that, at his request, the order was given to the War Department\r\nto construct four new balloons.\r\n\r\nIf this volume of “The Library of Wonders” had not had for its single\r\nobject “balloons and their history,” we would have devoted a chapter\r\nto the numerous attempts made to steer balloons. We shall only say here\r\nthat aerial navigation should be divided into two kinds with balloons,\r\nand without balloons. In the first case, it is limited to the study of\r\naerial currents, and to the art of rising to those currents which suit\r\nthe direction of the voyage undertaken. The balloon is not the master\r\nof the atmosphere; on the contrary, it is its powerless slave. In the\r\nsecond case, the discovery of Montgolfier is useless; and the question\r\nis, to find out a new machine capable of flying in the air, and at\r\nthe same time heavier than the air. Birds are, without doubt, the best\r\nmodels to study. But with what force shall we replace LIFE? The air-boat\r\nof M. Pline seems to us one of the best ideas; but the working of it\r\npresents many difficulties. Let us find a motive power at once light\r\nand powerful (aluminium and electricity, for example), and we will have\r\ndefinitively conquered the empire of the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s Wonderful Balloon Ascents, by Fulgence Marion\r\n\r\n***",
