Horne, Ph.D.\r\n\r\nProfessor of English, College of the City of New York; Author of “The\r\nTechnique of the Novel,” etc.\r\n\r\n[colophon omitted]\r\n\r\nF. Tyler Daniels Company, Inc.\r\n\r\nNew York :::: London\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1911 By Vincent Parke And Company\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO VOLUME NINE\r\n\r\n_Among so many effective and artistic tales, it is difficult to give a\r\npreference to one over all the rest. Yet, certainly, even amid Verne’s\r\nremarkable works, his “Off on a Comet” must be given high rank. Perhaps\r\nthis story will be remembered when even “Round the World in Eighty Days”\r\n and “Michael Strogoff” have been obliterated by centuries of time. At\r\nleast, of the many books since written upon the same theme as Verne’s,\r\nno one has yet succeeded in equaling or even approaching it.\r\n\r\nIn one way “Off on a Comet” shows a marked contrast to Verne’s earlier\r\nbooks. Not only does it invade a region more remote than even the\r\n“Trip to the Moon,” but the author here abandons his usual scrupulously\r\nscientific attitude. In order that he may escort us through the depths\r\nof immeasurable space, show us what astronomy really knows of conditions\r\nthere and upon the other planets, Verne asks us to accept a situation\r\nfrankly impossible. The earth and a comet are brought twice into\r\ncollision without mankind in general, or even our astronomers, becoming\r\nconscious of the fact. Moreover several people from widely scattered\r\nplaces are carried off by the comet and returned uninjured. Yet further,\r\nthe comet snatches for the convenience of its travelers, both air and\r\nwater. Little, useful tracts of earth are picked up and, as it were,\r\nturned over and clapped down right side up again upon the comet’s\r\nsurface. Even ships pass uninjured through this remarkable somersault.\r\nThese events all belong frankly to the realm of fairyland.\r\n\r\nIf the situation were reproduced in actuality, if ever a comet should\r\ncome into collision with the earth, we can conceive two scientifically\r\npossible results. If the comet were of such attenuation, such almost\r\ninfinitesimal mass as some of these celestial wanderers seem to be, we\r\ncan imagine our earth self-protective and possibly unharmed. If, on the\r\nother hand, the comet had even a hundredth part of the size and solidity\r\nand weight which Verne confers upon his monster so as to give his\r\ntravelers a home--in that case the collision would be unspeakably\r\ndisastrous--especially to the unlucky individuals who occupied the exact\r\npoint of contact.\r\n\r\nBut once granted the initial and the closing extravagance, the departure\r\nand return of his characters, the alpha and omega of his tale, how\r\nclosely the author clings to facts between! How closely he follows, and\r\nimparts to his readers, the scientific probabilities of the universe\r\nbeyond our earth, the actual knowledge so hard won by our astronomers!\r\nOther authors who, since Verne, have told of trips through the planetary\r\nand stellar universe have given free rein to fancy, to dreams of what\r\nmight be found. Verne has endeavored to impart only what is known to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nIn the same year with “Off on a Comet,” 1877, was published also\r\nthe tale variously named and translated as “The Black Indies,” “The\r\nUnderground City,” and “The Child of the Cavern.” This story, like\r\n“Round the World in Eighty Days” was first issued in “feuilleton” by the\r\nnoted Paris newspaper “Le Temps.” Its success did not equal that of its\r\npredecessor in this style. Some critics indeed have pointed to this work\r\nas marking the beginning of a decline in the author’s power of awaking\r\ninterest. Many of his best works were, however, still to follow. And, as\r\nregards imagination and the elements of mystery and awe, surely in the\r\n“Underground City” with its cavern world, its secret, undiscoverable,\r\nunrelenting foe, the “Harfang,” bird of evil omen, and the “fire\r\nmaidens” of the ruined castle, surely with all these “imagination” is\r\nanything but lacking.\r\n\r\nFrom the realistic side, the work is painstaking and exact as all the\r\nauthor’s works. The sketches of mines and miners, their courage and\r\ntheir dangers, their lives and their hopes, are carefully studied. So\r\nalso is the emotional aspect of the deeps under ground, the blackness,\r\nthe endless wandering passages, the silence, and the awe._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFF ON A COMET OR HECTOR SERVADAC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. A CHALLENGE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nothing, sir, can induce me to surrender my claim.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, count, but in such a matter your views cannot modify mine.”\r\n\r\n“But allow me to point out that my seniority unquestionably gives me a\r\nprior right.”\r\n\r\n“Mere seniority, I assert, in an affair of this kind, cannot possibly\r\nentitle you to any prior claim whatever.”\r\n\r\n“Then, captain, no alternative is left but for me to compel you to yield\r\nat the sword’s point.”\r\n\r\n“As you please, count; but neither sword nor pistol can force me to\r\nforego my pretensions. Here is my card.”\r\n\r\n“And mine.”\r\n\r\nThis rapid altercation was thus brought to an end by the formal\r\ninterchange of the names of the disputants. On one of the cards was\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n          _Captain Hector Servadac,\r\n                    Staff Officer, Mostaganem._\r\n\r\nOn the other was the title:\r\n\r\n               _Count Wassili Timascheff,\r\n                    On board the Schooner “Dobryna.”_\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to arrange that seconds should be appointed, who\r\nwould meet in Mostaganem at two o’clock that day; and the captain and\r\nthe count were on the point of parting from each other, with a salute of\r\npunctilious courtesy, when Timascheff, as if struck by a sudden thought,\r\nsaid abruptly: “Perhaps it would be better, captain, not to allow the\r\nreal cause of this to transpire?”\r\n\r\n“Far better,” replied Servadac; “it is undesirable in every way for any\r\nnames to be mentioned.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, however,” continued the count, “it will be necessary to\r\nassign an ostensible pretext of some kind. Shall we allege a musical\r\ndispute? a contention in which I feel bound to defend Wagner, while you\r\nare the zealous champion of Rossini?”\r\n\r\n“I am quite content,” answered Servadac, with a smile; and with another\r\nlow bow they parted.\r\n\r\nThe scene, as here depicted, took place upon the extremity of a little\r\ncape on the Algerian coast, between Mostaganem and Tenes, about two\r\nmiles from the mouth of the Shelif. The headland rose more than sixty\r\nfeet above the sea-level, and the azure waters of the Mediterranean, as\r\nthey softly kissed the strand, were tinged with the reddish hue of the\r\nferriferous rocks that formed its base. It was the 31st of December. The\r\nnoontide sun, which usually illuminated the various projections of the\r\ncoast with a dazzling brightness, was hidden by a dense mass of cloud,\r\nand the fog, which for some unaccountable cause, had hung for the\r\nlast two months over nearly every region in the world, causing serious\r\ninterruption to traffic between continent and continent, spread its\r\ndreary veil across land and sea.\r\n\r\nAfter taking leave of the staff-officer, Count Wassili Timascheff wended\r\nhis way down to a small creek, and took his seat in the stern of a light\r\nfour-oar that had been awaiting his return; this was immediately pushed\r\noff from shore, and was soon alongside a pleasure-yacht, that was lying\r\nto, not many cable lengths away.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from Servadac, an orderly, who had been standing at a\r\nrespectful distance, led forward a magnificent Arabian horse; the\r\ncaptain vaulted into the saddle, and followed by his attendant, well\r\nmounted as himself, started off towards Mostaganem. It was half-past\r\ntwelve when the two riders crossed the bridge that had been recently\r\nerected over the Shelif, and a quarter of an hour later their steeds,\r\nflecked with foam, dashed through the Mascara Gate, which was one of\r\nfive entrances opened in the embattled wall that encircled the town.\r\n\r\nAt that date, Mostaganem contained about fifteen thousand inhabitants,\r\nthree thousand of whom were French. Besides being one of the principal\r\ndistrict towns of the province of Oran, it was also a military station.\r\nMostaganem rejoiced in a well-sheltered harbor, which enabled her to\r\nutilize all the rich products of the Mina and the Lower Shelif. It was\r\nthe existence of so good a harbor amidst the exposed cliffs of this\r\ncoast that had induced the owner of the _Dobryna_ to winter in these\r\nparts, and for two months the Russian standard had been seen floating\r\nfrom her yard, whilst on her mast-head was hoisted the pennant of\r\nthe French Yacht Club, with the distinctive letters M. C. W. T., the\r\ninitials of Count Timascheff.\r\n\r\nHaving entered the town, Captain Servadac made his way towards Matmore,\r\nthe military quarter, and was not long in finding two friends on whom\r\nhe might rely--a major of the 2nd Fusileers, and a captain of the\r\n8th Artillery. The two officers listened gravely enough to Servadac’s\r\nrequest that they would act as his seconds in an affair of honor, but\r\ncould not resist a smile on hearing that the dispute between him and the\r\ncount had originated in a musical discussion. Surely, they suggested,\r\nthe matter might be easily arranged; a few slight concessions on either\r\nside, and all might be amicably adjusted. But no representations on\r\ntheir part were of any avail. Hector Servadac was inflexible.\r\n\r\n“No concession is possible,” he replied, resolutely. “Rossini has been\r\ndeeply injured, and I cannot suffer the injury to be unavenged. Wagner\r\nis a fool. I shall keep my word. I am quite firm.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so, then,” replied one of the officers; “and after all, you know,\r\na sword-cut need not be a very serious affair.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” rejoined Servadac; “and especially in my case, when I\r\nhave not the slightest intention of being wounded at all.”\r\n\r\nIncredulous as they naturally were as to the assigned cause of the\r\nquarrel, Servadac’s friends had no alternative but to accept his\r\nexplanation, and without farther parley they started for the staff\r\noffice, where, at two o’clock precisely, they were to meet the seconds\r\nof Count Timascheff. Two hours later they had returned. All the\r\npreliminaries had been arranged; the count, who like many Russians\r\nabroad was an aide-de-camp of the Czar, had of course proposed swords\r\nas the most appropriate weapons, and the duel was to take place on the\r\nfollowing morning, the first of January, at nine o’clock, upon the cliff\r\nat a spot about a mile and a half from the mouth of the Shelif. With\r\nthe assurance that they would not fail to keep their appointment with\r\nmilitary punctuality, the two officers cordially wrung their friend’s\r\nhand and retired to the Zulma Cafe for a game at piquet. Captain\r\nServadac at once retraced his steps and left the town.\r\n\r\nFor the last fortnight Servadac had not been occupying his proper\r\nlodgings in the military quarters; having been appointed to make a local\r\nlevy, he had been living in a gourbi, or native hut, on the Mostaganem\r\ncoast, between four and five miles from the Shelif. His orderly was his\r\nsole companion, and by any other man than the captain the enforced exile\r\nwould have been esteemed little short of a severe penance.\r\n\r\nOn his way to the gourbi, his mental occupation was a very laborious\r\neffort to put together what he was pleased to call a rondo, upon a model\r\nof versification all but obsolete. This rondo, it is unnecessary to\r\nconceal, was to be an ode addressed to a young widow by whom he had been\r\ncaptivated, and whom he was anxious to marry, and the tenor of his muse\r\nwas intended to prove that when once a man has found an object in\r\nall respects worthy of his affections, he should love her “in all\r\nsimplicity.” Whether the aphorism were universally true was not very\r\nmaterial to the gallant captain, whose sole ambition at present was to\r\nconstruct a roundelay of which this should be the prevailing sentiment.\r\nHe indulged the fancy that he might succeed in producing a composition\r\nwhich would have a fine effect here in Algeria, where poetry in that\r\nform was all but unknown.\r\n\r\n“I know well enough,” he said repeatedly to himself, “what I want to\r\nsay. I want to tell her that I love her sincerely, and wish to marry\r\nher; but, confound it! the words won’t rhyme. Plague on it! Does nothing\r\nrhyme with ‘simplicity’? Ah! I have it now:\r\n\r\n          ‘Lovers should, whoe’er they be,\r\n           Love in all simplicity.’\r\n\r\nBut what next? how am I to go on? I say, Ben Zoof,” he called aloud to\r\nhis orderly, who was trotting silently close in his rear, “did you ever\r\ncompose any poetry?”\r\n\r\n“No, captain,” answered the man promptly: “I have never made any verses,\r\nbut I have seen them made fast enough at a booth during the fete of\r\nMontmartre.”\r\n\r\n“Can you remember them?”\r\n\r\n“Remember them! to be sure I can. This is the way they began:\r\n\r\n     ‘Come in! come in! you’ll not repent\r\n     The entrance money you have spent;\r\n     The wondrous mirror in this place\r\n     Reveals your future sweetheart’s face.’”\r\n\r\n“Bosh!” cried Servadac in disgust; “your verses are detestable trash.”\r\n\r\n“As good as any others, captain, squeaked through a reed pipe.”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue, man,” said Servadac peremptorily; “I have made\r\nanother couplet.\r\n\r\n          ‘Lovers should, whoe’er they be,\r\n           Love in all simplicity;\r\n           Lover, loving honestly,\r\n           Offer I myself to thee.’”\r\n\r\nBeyond this, however, the captain’s poetical genius was impotent to\r\ncarry him; his farther efforts were unavailing, and when at six o’clock\r\nhe reached the gourbi, the four lines still remained the limit of his\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND HIS ORDERLY\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I write, there might be seen in the registers of\r\nthe Minister of War the following entry:\r\n\r\nSERVADAC (_Hector_), born at St. Trelody in the district of Lesparre,\r\ndepartment of the Gironde, July 19th, 18--.\r\n\r\n_Property:_ 1200 francs in rentes.\r\n\r\n_Length of service:_ Fourteen years, three months, and five days.\r\n\r\n_Service:_ Two years at school at St. Cyr; two years at L’Ecole\r\nd’Application; two years in the 8th Regiment of the Line; two years in\r\nthe 3rd Light Cavalry; seven years in Algeria.\r\n\r\n_Campaigns:_ Soudan and Japan.\r\n\r\n_Rank:_ Captain on the staff at Mostaganem.\r\n\r\n_Decorations:_ Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, March 13th, 18--.\r\n\r\nHector Servadac was thirty years of age, an orphan without lineage and\r\nalmost without means. Thirsting for glory rather than for gold, slightly\r\nscatter-brained, but warm-hearted, generous, and brave, he was eminently\r\nformed to be the protege of the god of battles.\r\n\r\nFor the first year and a half of his existence he had been the\r\nfoster-child of the sturdy wife of a vine-dresser of Medoc--a lineal\r\ndescendant of the heroes of ancient prowess; in a word, he was one of\r\nthose individuals whom nature seems to have predestined for remarkable\r\nthings, and around whose cradle have hovered the fairy godmothers of\r\nadventure and good luck.\r\n\r\nIn appearance Hector Servadac was quite the type of an officer; he was\r\nrather more than five feet six inches high, slim and graceful, with dark\r\ncurling hair and mustaches, well-formed hands and feet, and a clear blue\r\neye. He seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he\r\npossessed. It must be owned, and no one was more ready to confess it\r\nthan himself, that his literary attainments were by no means of a high\r\norder. “We don’t spin tops” is a favorite saying amongst artillery\r\nofficers, indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous\r\npursuits; but it must be confessed that Servadac, being naturally idle,\r\nwas very much given to “spinning tops.” His good abilities, however,\r\nand his ready intelligence had carried him successfully through the\r\ncurriculum of his early career. He was a good draughtsman, an excellent\r\nrider--having thoroughly mastered the successor to the famous “Uncle\r\nTom” at the riding-school of St. Cyr--and in the records of his military\r\nservice his name had several times been included in the order of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe following episode may suffice, in a certain degree, to illustrate\r\nhis character. Once, in action, he was leading a detachment of infantry\r\nthrough an intrenchment. They came to a place where the side-work of the\r\ntrench had been so riddled by shell that a portion of it had actually\r\nfallen in, leaving an aperture quite unsheltered from the grape-shot\r\nthat was pouring in thick and fast. The men hesitated. In an instant\r\nServadac mounted the side-work, laid himself down in the gap, and thus\r\nfilling up the breach by his own body, shouted, “March on!”\r\n\r\nAnd through a storm of shot, not one of which touched the prostrate\r\nofficer, the troop passed in safety.\r\n\r\nSince leaving the military college, Servadac, with the exception of\r\nhis two campaigns in the Soudan and Japan, had been always stationed in\r\nAlgeria. He had now a staff appointment at Mostaganem, and had lately\r\nbeen entrusted with some topographical work on the coast between Tenes\r\nand the Shelif. It was a matter of little consequence to him that the\r\ngourbi, in which of necessity he was quartered, was uncomfortable and\r\nill-contrived; he loved the open air, and the independence of his life\r\nsuited him well. Sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore,\r\nand sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff;\r\naltogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end. His\r\noccupation, moreover, was not so engrossing but that he could find\r\nleisure for taking a short railway journey once or twice a week; so\r\nthat he was ever and again putting in an appearance at the general’s\r\nreceptions at Oran, and at the fetes given by the governor at Algiers.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of these occasions that he had first met Madame de L----,\r\nthe lady to whom he was desirous of dedicating the rondo, the first four\r\nlines of which had just seen the light. She was a colonel’s widow,\r\nyoung and handsome, very reserved, not to say haughty in her manner, and\r\neither indifferent or impervious to the admiration which she inspired.\r\nCaptain Servadac had not yet ventured to declare his attachment; of\r\nrivals he was well aware he had not a few, and amongst these not the\r\nleast formidable was the Russian Count Timascheff. And although the\r\nyoung widow was all unconscious of the share she had in the matter, it\r\nwas she, and she alone, who was the cause of the challenge just given\r\nand accepted by her two ardent admirers.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in the gourbi, Hector Servadac’s sole companion\r\nwas his orderly, Ben Zoof. Ben Zoof was devoted, body and soul, to his\r\nsuperior officer. His own personal ambition was so entirely absorbed in\r\nhis master’s welfare, that it is certain no offer of promotion--even had\r\nit been that of aide-de-camp to the Governor-General of Algiers--would\r\nhave induced him to quit that master’s service. His name might seem\r\nto imply that he was a native of Algeria; but such was by no means the\r\ncase. His true name was Laurent; he was a native of Montmartre in Paris,\r\nand how or why he had obtained his patronymic was one of those anomalies\r\nwhich the most sagacious of etymologists would find it hard to explain.\r\n\r\nBorn on the hill of Montmartre, between the Solferino tower and the\r\nmill of La Galette, Ben Zoof had ever possessed the most unreserved\r\nadmiration for his birthplace; and to his eyes the heights and district\r\nof Montmartre represented an epitome of all the wonders of the world.\r\nIn all his travels, and these had been not a few, he had never\r\nbeheld scenery which could compete with that of his native home.\r\nNo cathedral--not even Burgos itself--could vie with the church at\r\nMontmartre. Its race-course could well hold its own against that at\r\nPentelique; its reservoir would throw the Mediterranean into the shade;\r\nits forests had flourished long before the invasion of the Celts; and\r\nits very mill produced no ordinary flour, but provided material\r\nfor cakes of world-wide renown. To crown all, Montmartre boasted a\r\nmountain--a veritable mountain; envious tongues indeed might pronounce\r\nit little more than a hill; but Ben Zoof would have allowed himself\r\nto be hewn in pieces rather than admit that it was anything less than\r\nfifteen thousand feet in height.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof’s most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with\r\nhim and end his days in his much-loved home, and so incessantly were\r\nServadac’s ears besieged with descriptions of the unparalleled beauties\r\nand advantages of this eighteenth arrondissement of Paris, that he\r\ncould scarcely hear the name of Montmartre without a conscious thrill\r\nof aversion. Ben Zoof, however, did not despair of ultimately converting\r\nthe captain, and meanwhile had resolved never to leave him. When a\r\nprivate in the 8th Cavalry, he had been on the point of quitting\r\nthe army at twenty-eight years of age, but unexpectedly he had been\r\nappointed orderly to Captain Servadac. Side by side they fought in two\r\ncampaigns. Servadac had saved Ben Zoof’s life in Japan; Ben Zoof had\r\nrendered his master a like service in the Soudan. The bond of union thus\r\neffected could never be severed; and although Ben Zoof’s achievements\r\nhad fairly earned him the right of retirement, he firmly declined all\r\nhonors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer. Two\r\nstout arms, an iron constitution, a powerful frame, and an indomitable\r\ncourage were all loyally devoted to his master’s service, and fairly\r\nentitled him to his _soi-disant_ designation of “The Rampart of\r\nMontmartre.” Unlike his master, he made no pretension to any gift\r\nof poetic power, but his inexhaustible memory made him a living\r\nencyclopaedia; and for his stock of anecdotes and trooper’s tales he was\r\nmatchless.\r\n\r\nThoroughly appreciating his servant’s good qualities, Captain Servadac\r\nendured with imperturbable good humor those idiosyncrasies, which in\r\na less faithful follower would have been intolerable, and from time\r\nto time he would drop a word of sympathy that served to deepen his\r\nsubordinate’s devotion.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when Ben Zoof had mounted his hobby-horse, and\r\nwas indulging in high-flown praises about his beloved eighteenth\r\narrondissement, the captain had remarked gravely, “Do you know, Ben\r\nZoof, that Montmartre only requires a matter of some thirteen thousand\r\nfeet to make it as high as Mont Blanc?”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof’s eyes glistened with delight; and from that moment Hector\r\nServadac and Montmartre held equal places in his affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. INTERRUPTED EFFUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nComposed of mud and loose stones, and covered with a thatch of turf and\r\nstraw, known to the natives by the name of “driss,” the gourbi, though a\r\ngrade better than the tents of the nomad Arabs, was yet far inferior\r\nto any habitation built of brick or stone. It adjoined an old stone\r\nhostelry, previously occupied by a detachment of engineers, and which\r\nnow afforded shelter for Ben Zoof and the two horses. It still\r\ncontained a considerable number of tools, such as mattocks, shovels, and\r\npick-axes.\r\n\r\nUncomfortable as was their temporary abode, Servadac and his attendant\r\nmade no complaints; neither of them was dainty in the matter either of\r\nboard or lodging. After dinner, leaving his orderly to stow away the\r\nremains of the repast in what he was pleased to term the “cupboard of\r\nhis stomach.” Captain Servadac turned out into the open air to smoke his\r\npipe upon the edge of the cliff. The shades of night were drawing on.\r\nAn hour previously, veiled in heavy clouds, the sun had sunk below the\r\nhorizon that bounded the plain beyond the Shelif.\r\n\r\nThe sky presented a most singular appearance. Towards the north,\r\nalthough the darkness rendered it impossible to see beyond a quarter\r\nof a mile, the upper strata of the atmosphere were suffused with a\r\nrosy glare. No well-defined fringe of light, nor arch of luminous rays,\r\nbetokened a display of aurora borealis, even had such a phenomenon been\r\npossible in these latitudes; and the most experienced meteorologist\r\nwould have been puzzled to explain the cause of this striking\r\nillumination on this 31st of December, the last evening of the passing\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Servadac was no meteorologist, and it is to be doubted\r\nwhether, since leaving school, he had ever opened his “Course of\r\nCosmography.” Besides, he had other thoughts to occupy his mind. The\r\nprospects of the morrow offered serious matter for consideration. The\r\ncaptain was actuated by no personal animosity against the count; though\r\nrivals, the two men regarded each other with sincere respect; they had\r\nsimply reached a crisis in which one of them was _de trop;_ which of\r\nthem, fate must decide.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock, Captain Servadac re-entered the gourbi, the single\r\napartment of which contained his bed, a small writing-table, and some\r\ntrunks that served instead of cupboards. The orderly performed his\r\nculinary operations in the adjoining building, which he also used as a\r\nbed-room, and where, extended on what he called his “good oak mattress,”\r\n he would sleep soundly as a dormouse for twelve hours at a stretch. Ben\r\nZoof had not yet received his orders to retire, and ensconcing himself\r\nin a corner of the gourbi, he endeavored to doze--a task which the\r\nunusual agitation of his master rendered somewhat difficult. Captain\r\nServadac was evidently in no hurry to betake himself to rest, but\r\nseating himself at his table, with a pair of compasses and a sheet of\r\ntracing-paper, he began to draw, with red and blue crayons, a variety\r\nof colored lines, which could hardly be supposed to have much connection\r\nwith a topographical survey. In truth, his character of staff-officer\r\nwas now entirely absorbed in that of Gascon poet. Whether he imagined\r\nthat the compasses would bestow upon his verses the measure of a\r\nmathematical accuracy, or whether he fancied that the parti-colored\r\nlines would lend variety to his rhythm, it is impossible to determine;\r\nbe that as it may, he was devoting all his energies to the compilation\r\nof his rondo, and supremely difficult he found the task.\r\n\r\n“Hang it!” he ejaculated, “whatever induced me to choose this meter? It\r\nis as hard to find rhymes as to rally fugitive in a battle. But, by all\r\nthe powers! it shan’t be said that a French officer cannot cope with a\r\npiece of poetry. One battalion has fought--now for the rest!”\r\n\r\nPerseverance had its reward. Presently two lines, one red, the other\r\nblue, appeared upon the paper, and the captain murmured:\r\n\r\n          “Words, mere words, cannot avail,\r\n           Telling true heart’s tender tale.”\r\n\r\n“What on earth ails my master?” muttered Ben Zoof; “for the last hour he\r\nhas been as fidgety as a bird returning after its winter migration.”\r\n\r\nServadac suddenly started from his seat, and as he paced the room with\r\nall the frenzy of poetic inspiration, read out:\r\n\r\n          “Empty words cannot convey\r\n           All a lover’s heart would say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, to be sure, he is at his everlasting verses again!” said Ben Zoof\r\nto himself, as he roused himself in his corner. “Impossible to sleep in\r\nsuch a noise;” and he gave vent to a loud groan.\r\n\r\n“How now, Ben Zoof?” said the captain sharply. “What ails you?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, sir, only the nightmare.”\r\n\r\n“Curse the fellow, he has quite interrupted me!” ejaculated the captain.\r\n“Ben Zoof!” he called aloud.\r\n\r\n“Here, sir!” was the prompt reply; and in an instant the orderly\r\nwas upon his feet, standing in a military attitude, one hand to his\r\nforehead, the other closely pressed to his trouser-seam.\r\n\r\n“Stay where you are! don’t move an inch!” shouted Servadac; “I have\r\njust thought of the end of my rondo.” And in a voice of inspiration,\r\naccompanying his words with dramatic gestures, Servadac began to\r\ndeclaim:\r\n\r\n     “Listen, lady, to my vows--\r\n     O, consent to be my spouse;\r\n     Constant ever I will be,\r\n     Constant....”\r\n\r\nNo closing lines were uttered. All at once, with unutterable violence,\r\nthe captain and his orderly were dashed, face downwards, to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. A CONVULSION OF NATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence came it that at that very moment the horizon underwent so strange\r\nand sudden a modification, that the eye of the most practiced mariner\r\ncould not distinguish between sea and sky?\r\n\r\nWhence came it that the billows raged and rose to a height hitherto\r\nunregistered in the records of science?\r\n\r\nWhence came it that the elements united in one deafening crash; that the\r\nearth groaned as though the whole framework of the globe were ruptured;\r\nthat the waters roared from their innermost depths; that the air\r\nshrieked with all the fury of a cyclone?\r\n\r\nWhence came it that a radiance, intenser than the effulgence of the\r\nNorthern Lights, overspread the firmament, and momentarily dimmed the\r\nsplendor of the brightest stars?\r\n\r\nWhence came it that the Mediterranean, one instant emptied of its\r\nwaters, was the next flooded with a foaming surge?\r\n\r\nWhence came it that in the space of a few seconds the moon’s disc\r\nreached a magnitude as though it were but a tenth part of its ordinary\r\ndistance from the earth?\r\n\r\nWhence came it that a new blazing spheroid, hitherto unknown to\r\nastronomy, now appeared suddenly in the firmament, though it were but to\r\nlose itself immediately behind masses of accumulated cloud?\r\n\r\nWhat phenomenon was this that had produced a cataclysm so tremendous in\r\neffect upon earth, sky, and sea?\r\n\r\nWas it possible that a single human being could have survived the\r\nconvulsion? and if so, could he explain its mystery?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. A MYSTERIOUS SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nViolent as the commotion had been, that portion of the Algerian coast\r\nwhich is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean, and on the west by\r\nthe right bank of the Shelif, appeared to have suffered little change.\r\nIt is true that indentations were perceptible in the fertile plain,\r\nand the surface of the sea was ruffled with an agitation that was quite\r\nunusual; but the rugged outline of the cliff was the same as heretofore,\r\nand the aspect of the entire scene appeared unaltered. The stone\r\nhostelry, with the exception of some deep clefts in its walls, had\r\nsustained little injury; but the gourbi, like a house of cards destroyed\r\nby an infant’s breath, had completely subsided, and its two inmates lay\r\nmotionless, buried under the sunken thatch.\r\n\r\nIt was two hours after the catastrophe that Captain Servadac regained\r\nconsciousness; he had some trouble to collect his thoughts, and the\r\nfirst sounds that escaped his lips were the concluding words of the\r\nrondo which had been so ruthlessly interrupted;\r\n\r\n          “Constant ever I will be,\r\n           Constant....”\r\n\r\nHis next thought was to wonder what had happened; and in order to find\r\nan answer, he pushed aside the broken thatch, so that his head appeared\r\nabove the _debris_. “The gourbi leveled to the ground!” he exclaimed,\r\n“surely a waterspout has passed along the coast.”\r\n\r\nHe felt all over his body to perceive what injuries he had sustained,\r\nbut not a sprain nor a scratch could he discover. “Where are you, Ben\r\nZoof?” he shouted.\r\n\r\n“Here, sir!” and with military promptitude a second head protruded from\r\nthe rubbish.\r\n\r\n“Have you any notion what has happened, Ben Zoof?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve a notion, captain, that it’s all up with us.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Ben Zoof; it is nothing but a waterspout!”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” was the philosophical reply, immediately followed by\r\nthe query, “Any bones broken, sir?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” said the captain.\r\n\r\nBoth men were soon on their feet, and began to make a vigorous clearance\r\nof the ruins, beneath which they found that their arms, cooking\r\nutensils, and other property, had sustained little injury.\r\n\r\n“By-the-by, what o’clock is it?” asked the captain.\r\n\r\n“It must be eight o’clock, at least,” said Ben Zoof, looking at the sun,\r\nwhich was a considerable height above the horizon. “It is almost time\r\nfor us to start.”\r\n\r\n“To start! what for?”\r\n\r\n“To keep your appointment with Count Timascheff.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove! I had forgotten all about it!” exclaimed Servadac. Then\r\nlooking at his watch, he cried, “What are you thinking of, Ben Zoof? It\r\nis scarcely two o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Two in the morning, or two in the afternoon?” asked Ben Zoof, again\r\nregarding the sun.\r\n\r\nServadac raised his watch to his ear. “It is going,” said he; “but, by\r\nall the wines of Medoc, I am puzzled. Don’t you see the sun is in the\r\nwest? It must be near setting.”\r\n\r\n“Setting, captain! Why, it is rising finely, like a conscript at the\r\nsound of the reveille. It is considerably higher since we have been\r\ntalking.”\r\n\r\nIncredible as it might appear, the fact was undeniable that the sun was\r\nrising over the Shelif from that quarter of the horizon behind which\r\nit usually sank for the latter portion of its daily round. They were\r\nutterly bewildered. Some mysterious phenomenon must not only have\r\naltered the position of the sun in the sidereal system, but must even\r\nhave brought about an important modification of the earth’s rotation on\r\nher axis.\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac consoled himself with the prospect of reading an\r\nexplanation of the mystery in next week’s newspapers, and turned his\r\nattention to what was to him of more immediate importance. “Come, let\r\nus be off,” said he to his orderly; “though heaven and earth be\r\ntopsy-turvy, I must be at my post this morning.”\r\n\r\n“To do Count Timascheff the honor of running him through the body,”\r\n added Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\nIf Servadac and his orderly had been less preoccupied, they would have\r\nnoticed that a variety of other physical changes besides the apparent\r\nalteration in the movement of the sun had been evolved during the\r\natmospheric disturbances of that New Year’s night. As they descended\r\nthe steep footpath leading from the cliff towards the Shelif, they were\r\nunconscious that their respiration became forced and rapid, like that of\r\na mountaineer when he has reached an altitude where the air has become\r\nless charged with oxygen. They were also unconscious that their voices\r\nwere thin and feeble; either they must themselves have become rather\r\ndeaf, or it was evident that the air had become less capable of\r\ntransmitting sound.\r\n\r\nThe weather, which on the previous evening had been very foggy, had\r\nentirely changed. The sky had assumed a singular tint, and was soon\r\ncovered with lowering clouds that completely hid the sun. There were,\r\nindeed, all the signs of a coming storm, but the vapor, on account of\r\nthe insufficient condensation, failed to fall.\r\n\r\nThe sea appeared quite deserted, a most unusual circumstance along this\r\ncoast, and not a sail nor a trail of smoke broke the gray monotony\r\nof water and sky. The limits of the horizon, too, had become much\r\ncircumscribed. On land, as well as on sea, the remote distance had\r\ncompletely disappeared, and it seemed as though the globe had assumed a\r\nmore decided convexity.\r\n\r\nAt the pace at which they were walking, it was very evident that the\r\ncaptain and his attendant would not take long to accomplish the three\r\nmiles that lay between the gourbi and the place of rendezvous. They\r\ndid not exchange a word, but each was conscious of an unusual buoyancy,\r\nwhich appeared to lift up their bodies and give as it were, wings to\r\ntheir feet. If Ben Zoof had expressed his sensations in words, he would\r\nhave said that he felt “up to anything,” and he had even forgotten to\r\ntaste so much as a crust of bread, a lapse of memory of which the worthy\r\nsoldier was rarely guilty.\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts were crossing his mind, a harsh bark was heard to the\r\nleft of the footpath, and a jackal was seen emerging from a large grove\r\nof lentisks. Regarding the two wayfarers with manifest uneasiness, the\r\nbeast took up its position at the foot of a rock, more than thirty feet\r\nin height. It belonged to an African species distinguished by a\r\nblack spotted skin, and a black line down the front of the legs. At\r\nnight-time, when they scour the country in herds, the creatures are\r\nsomewhat formidable, but singly they are no more dangerous than a dog.\r\nThough by no means afraid of them, Ben Zoof had a particular aversion\r\nto jackals, perhaps because they had no place among the fauna of his\r\nbeloved Montmartre. He accordingly began to make threatening gestures,\r\nwhen, to the unmitigated astonishment of himself and the captain, the\r\nanimal darted forward, and in one single bound gained the summit of the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!” cried Ben Zoof, “that leap must have been thirty feet at\r\nleast.”\r\n\r\n“True enough,” replied the captain; “I never saw such a jump.”\r\n\r\nMeantime the jackal had seated itself upon its haunches, and was staring\r\nat the two men with an air of impudent defiance. This was too much for\r\nBen Zoof’s forbearance, and stooping down he caught up a huge stone,\r\nwhen to his surprise, he found that it was no heavier than a piece of\r\npetrified sponge. “Confound the brute!” he exclaimed, “I might as well\r\nthrow a piece of bread at him. What accounts for its being as light as\r\nthis?”\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, however, he hurled the stone into the air. It missed\r\nits aim; but the jackal, deeming it on the whole prudent to decamp,\r\ndisappeared across the trees and hedges with a series of bounds, which\r\ncould only be likened to those that might be made by an india-rubber\r\nkangaroo. Ben Zoof was sure that his own powers of propelling must equal\r\nthose of a howitzer, for his stone, after a lengthened flight through\r\nthe air, fell to the ground full five hundred paces the other side of\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\nThe orderly was now some yards ahead of his master, and had reached\r\na ditch full of water, and about ten feet wide. With the intention of\r\nclearing it, he made a spring, when a loud cry burst from Servadac. “Ben\r\nZoof, you idiot! What are you about? You will break your back!”\r\n\r\nAnd well might he be alarmed, for Ben Zoof had sprung to a height of\r\nforty feet into the air. Fearful of the consequences that would attend\r\nthe descent of his servant to _terra firma_, Servadac bounded forwards,\r\nto be on the other side of the ditch in time to break his fall. But the\r\nmuscular effort that he made carried him in his turn to an altitude of\r\nthirty feet; in his ascent he passed Ben Zoof, who had already commenced\r\nhis downward course; and then, obedient to the laws of gravitation, he\r\ndescended with increasing rapidity, and alighted upon the earth without\r\nexperiencing a shock greater than if he had merely made a bound of four\r\nor five feet high.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof burst into a roar of laughter. “Bravo!” he said, “we should\r\nmake a good pair of clowns.”\r\n\r\nBut the captain was inclined to take a more serious view of the matter.\r\nFor a few seconds he stood lost in thought, then said solemnly, “Ben\r\nZoof, I must be dreaming. Pinch me hard; I must be either asleep or\r\nmad.”\r\n\r\n“It is very certain that something has happened to us,” said Ben Zoof.\r\n“I have occasionally dreamed that I was a swallow flying over the\r\nMontmartre, but I never experienced anything of this kind before; it\r\nmust be peculiar to the coast of Algeria.”\r\n\r\nServadac was stupefied; he felt instinctively that he was not dreaming,\r\nand yet was powerless to solve the mystery. He was not, however, the man\r\nto puzzle himself for long over any insoluble problem. “Come what may,”\r\n he presently exclaimed, “we will make up our minds for the future to be\r\nsurprised at nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Right, captain,” replied Ben Zoof; “and, first of all, let us settle\r\nour little score with Count Timascheff.”\r\n\r\nBeyond the ditch lay a small piece of meadow land, about an acre in\r\nextent. A soft and delicious herbage carpeted the soil, whilst trees\r\nformed a charming framework to the whole. No spot could have been chosen\r\nmore suitable for the meeting between the two adversaries.\r\n\r\nServadac cast a hasty glance round. No one was in sight. “We are the\r\nfirst on the field,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Not so sure of that, sir,” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Servadac, looking at his watch, which he had\r\nset as nearly as possible by the sun before leaving the gourbi; “it is\r\nnot nine o’clock yet.”\r\n\r\n“Look up there, sir. I am much mistaken if that is not the sun;” and as\r\nBen Zoof spoke, he pointed directly overhead to where a faint white disc\r\nwas dimly visible through the haze of clouds.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed Servadac. “How can the sun be in the zenith, in\r\nthe month of January, in lat. 39 degrees N.?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t say, sir. I only know the sun is there; and at the rate he has\r\nbeen traveling, I would lay my cap to a dish of couscous that in less\r\nthan three hours he will have set.”\r\n\r\nHector Servadac, mute and motionless, stood with folded arms. Presently\r\nhe roused himself, and began to look about again. “What means all this?”\r\n he murmured. “Laws of gravity disturbed! Points of the compass reversed!\r\nThe length of day reduced one half! Surely this will indefinitely\r\npostpone my meeting with the count. Something has happened; Ben Zoof and\r\nI cannot both be mad!”\r\n\r\nThe orderly, meantime, surveyed his master with the greatest equanimity;\r\nno phenomenon, however extraordinary, would have drawn from him a\r\nsingle exclamation of surprise. “Do you see anyone, Ben Zoof?” asked the\r\ncaptain, at last.\r\n\r\n“No one, sir; the count has evidently been and gone.” “But supposing\r\nthat to be the case,” persisted the captain, “my seconds would have\r\nwaited, and not seeing me, would have come on towards the gourbi. I can\r\nonly conclude that they have been unable to get here; and as for Count\r\nTimascheff--”\r\n\r\nWithout finishing his sentence. Captain Servadac, thinking it just\r\nprobable that the count, as on the previous evening, might come by\r\nwater, walked to the ridge of rock that overhung the shore, in order\r\nto ascertain if the _Dobryna_ were anywhere in sight. But the sea was\r\ndeserted, and for the first time the captain noticed that, although\r\nthe wind was calm, the waters were unusually agitated, and seethed and\r\nfoamed as though they were boiling. It was very certain that the yacht\r\nwould have found a difficulty in holding her own in such a swell.\r\nAnother thing that now struck Servadac was the extraordinary contraction\r\nof the horizon. Under ordinary circumstances, his elevated position\r\nwould have allowed him a radius of vision at least five and twenty miles\r\nin length; but the terrestrial sphere seemed, in the course of the last\r\nfew hours, to have become considerably reduced in volume, and he could\r\nnow see for a distance of only six miles in every direction.\r\n\r\nMeantime, with the agility of a monkey, Ben Zoof had clambered to the\r\ntop of a eucalyptus, and from his lofty perch was surveying the\r\ncountry to the south, as well as towards both Tenes and Mostaganem. On\r\ndescending, be informed the captain that the plain was deserted.\r\n\r\n“We will make our way to the river, and get over into Mostaganem,” said\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\nThe Shelif was not more than a mile and a half from the meadow, but\r\nno time was to be lost if the two men were to reach the town before\r\nnightfall. Though still hidden by heavy clouds, the sun was evidently\r\ndeclining fast; and what was equally inexplicable, it was not following\r\nthe oblique curve that in these latitudes and at this time of year might\r\nbe expected, but was sinking perpendicularly on to the horizon.\r\n\r\nAs he went along, Captain Servadac pondered deeply. Perchance some\r\nunheard-of phenomenon had modified the rotary motion of the globe; or\r\nperhaps the Algerian coast had been transported beyond the equator\r\ninto the southern hemisphere. Yet the earth, with the exception of the\r\nalteration in its convexity, in this part of Africa at least, seemed to\r\nhave undergone no change of any very great importance. As far as the eye\r\ncould reach, the shore was, as it had ever been, a succession of\r\ncliffs, beach, and arid rocks, tinged with a red ferruginous hue. To\r\nthe south--if south, in this inverted order of things, it might still\r\nbe called--the face of the country also appeared unaltered, and some\r\nleagues away, the peaks of the Merdeyah mountains still retained their\r\naccustomed outline.\r\n\r\nPresently a rift in the clouds gave passage to an oblique ray of light\r\nthat clearly proved that the sun was setting in the east.\r\n\r\n“Well, I am curious to know what they think of all this at Mostaganem,”\r\n said the captain. “I wonder, too, what the Minister of War will say when\r\nhe receives a telegram informing him that his African colony has become,\r\nnot morally, but physically disorganized; that the cardinal points\r\nare at variance with ordinary rules, and that the sun in the month of\r\nJanuary is shining down vertically upon our heads.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof, whose ideas of discipline were extremely rigid, at once\r\nsuggested that the colony should be put under the surveillance of the\r\npolice, that the cardinal points should be placed under restraint, and\r\nthat the sun should be shot for breach of discipline.\r\n\r\nMeantime, they were both advancing with the utmost speed. The\r\ndecompression of the atmosphere made the specific gravity of their\r\nbodies extraordinarily light, and they ran like hares and leaped like\r\nchamois. Leaving the devious windings of the footpath, they went as\r\na crow would fly across the country. Hedges, trees, and streams were\r\ncleared at a bound, and under these conditions Ben Zoof felt that he\r\ncould have overstepped Montmartre at a single stride. The earth seemed\r\nas elastic as the springboard of an acrobat; they scarcely touched it\r\nwith their feet, and their only fear was lest the height to which they\r\nwere propelled would consume the time which they were saving by their\r\nshort cut across the fields.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before their wild career brought them to the right bank\r\nof the Shelif. Here they were compelled to stop, for not only had the\r\nbridge completely disappeared, but the river itself no longer existed.\r\nOf the left bank there was not the slightest trace, and the right bank,\r\nwhich on the previous evening had bounded the yellow stream, as it\r\nmurmured peacefully along the fertile plain, had now become the shore of\r\na tumultuous ocean, its azure waters extending westwards far as the eye\r\ncould reach, and annihilating the tract of country which had hitherto\r\nformed the district of Mostaganem. The shore coincided exactly with what\r\nhad been the right bank of the Shelif, and in a slightly curved line\r\nran north and south, whilst the adjacent groves and meadows all retained\r\ntheir previous positions. But the river-bank had become the shore of an\r\nunknown sea.\r\n\r\nEager to throw some light upon the mystery, Servadac hurriedly made his\r\nway through the oleander bushes that overhung the shore, took up some\r\nwater in the hollow of his hand, and carried it to his lips. “Salt\r\nas brine!” he exclaimed, as soon as he had tasted it. “The sea has\r\nundoubtedly swallowed up all the western part of Algeria.”\r\n\r\n“It will not last long, sir,” said Ben Zoof. “It is, probably, only a\r\nsevere flood.”\r\n\r\nThe captain shook his head. “Worse than that, I fear, Ben Zoof,” he\r\nreplied with emotion. “It is a catastrophe that may have very\r\nserious consequences. What can have become of all my friends and\r\nfellow-officers?”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof was silent. Rarely had he seen his master so much agitated;\r\nand though himself inclined to receive these phenomena with philosophic\r\nindifference, his notions of military duty caused his countenance to\r\nreflect the captain’s expression of amazement.\r\n\r\nBut there was little time for Servadac to examine the changes which a\r\nfew hours had wrought. The sun had already reached the eastern horizon,\r\nand just as though it were crossing the ecliptic under the tropics,\r\nit sank like a cannon ball into the sea. Without any warning, day gave\r\nplace to night, and earth, sea, and sky were immediately wrapped in\r\nprofound obscurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE CAPTAIN MAKES AN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\n\r\nHector Servadac was not the man to remain long unnerved by any untoward\r\nevent. It was part of his character to discover the why and the\r\nwherefore of everything that came under his observation, and he would\r\nhave faced a cannon ball the more unflinchingly from understanding the\r\ndynamic force by which it was propelled. Such being his temperament, it\r\nmay well be imagined that he was anxious not to remain long in ignorance\r\nof the cause of the phenomena which had been so startling in their\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n“We must inquire into this to-morrow,” he exclaimed, as darkness fell\r\nsuddenly upon him. Then, after a pause, he added: “That is to say, if\r\nthere is to be a to-morrow; for if I were to be put to the torture, I\r\ncould not tell what has become of the sun.”\r\n\r\n“May I ask, sir, what we are to do now?” put in Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“Stay where we are for the present; and when daylight appears--if it\r\never does appear--we will explore the coast to the west and south, and\r\nreturn to the gourbi. If we can find out nothing else, we must at least\r\ndiscover where we are.”\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, sir, may we go to sleep?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, if you like, and if you can.”\r\n\r\nNothing loath to avail himself of his master’s permission, Ben Zoof\r\ncrouched down in an angle of the shore, threw his arms over his eyes,\r\nand very soon slept the sleep of the ignorant, which is often sounder\r\nthan the sleep of the just. Overwhelmed by the questions that crowded\r\nupon his brain, Captain Servadac could only wander up and down the\r\nshore. Again and again he asked himself what the catastrophe could\r\nportend. Had the towns of Algiers, Oran, and Mostaganem escaped the\r\ninundation? Could he bring himself to believe that all the inhabitants,\r\nhis friends, and comrades had perished; or was it not more probable\r\nthat the Mediterranean had merely invaded the region of the mouth of\r\nthe Shelif? But this supposition did not in the least explain the other\r\nphysical disturbances. Another hypothesis that presented itself to his\r\nmind was that the African coast might have been suddenly transported to\r\nthe equatorial zone. But although this might get over the difficulty\r\nof the altered altitude of the sun and the absence of twilight, yet\r\nit would neither account for the sun setting in the east, nor for the\r\nlength of the day being reduced to six hours.\r\n\r\n“We must wait till to-morrow,” he repeated; adding, for he had become\r\ndistrustful of the future, “that is to say, if to-morrow ever comes.”\r\n\r\nAlthough not very learned in astronomy, Servadac was acquainted with\r\nthe position of the principal constellations. It was therefore a\r\nconsiderable disappointment to him that, in consequence of the heavy\r\nclouds, not a star was visible in the firmament. To have ascertained\r\nthat the pole-star had become displaced would have been an undeniable\r\nproof that the earth was revolving on a new axis; but not a rift\r\nappeared in the lowering clouds, which seemed to threaten torrents of\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the moon was new on that very day; naturally,\r\ntherefore, it would have set at the same time as the sun. What, then,\r\nwas the captain’s bewilderment when, after he had been walking for about\r\nan hour and a half, he noticed on the western horizon a strong glare\r\nthat penetrated even the masses of the clouds.\r\n\r\n“The moon in the west!” he cried aloud; but suddenly bethinking himself,\r\nhe added: “But no, that cannot be the moon; unless she had shifted very\r\nmuch nearer the earth, she could never give a light as intense as this.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the screen of vapor was illuminated to such a degree that\r\nthe whole country was as it were bathed in twilight. “What can this be?”\r\n soliloquized the captain. “It cannot be the sun, for the sun set in the\r\neast only an hour and a half ago. Would that those clouds would disclose\r\nwhat enormous luminary lies behind them! What a fool I was not to have\r\nlearnt more astronomy! Perhaps, after all, I am racking my brain over\r\nsomething that is quite in the ordinary course of nature.”\r\n\r\nBut, reason as he might, the mysteries of the heavens still remained\r\nimpenetrable. For about an hour some luminous body, its disc evidently\r\nof gigantic dimensions, shed its rays upon the upper strata of the\r\nclouds; then, marvelous to relate, instead of obeying the ordinary laws\r\nof celestial mechanism, and descending upon the opposite horizon, it\r\nseemed to retreat farther off, grew dimmer, and vanished.\r\n\r\nThe darkness that returned to the face of the earth was not more\r\nprofound than the gloom which fell upon the captain’s soul. Everything\r\nwas incomprehensible. The simplest mechanical rules seemed falsified;\r\nthe planets had defied the laws of gravitation; the motions of the\r\ncelestial spheres were erroneous as those of a watch with a defective\r\nmainspring, and there was reason to fear that the sun would never again\r\nshed his radiance upon the earth.\r\n\r\nBut these last fears were groundless. In three hours’ time, without any\r\nintervening twilight, the morning sun made its appearance in the west,\r\nand day once more had dawned. On consulting his watch, Servadac\r\nfound that night had lasted precisely six hours. Ben Zoof, who was\r\nunaccustomed to so brief a period of repose, was still slumbering\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\n“Come, wake up!” said Servadac, shaking him by the shoulder; “it is time\r\nto start.”\r\n\r\n“Time to start?” exclaimed Ben Zoof, rubbing his eyes. “I feel as if I\r\nhad only just gone to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“You have slept all night, at any rate,” replied the captain; “it has\r\nonly been for six hours, but you must make it enough.”\r\n\r\n“Enough it shall be, sir,” was the submissive rejoinder.\r\n\r\n“And now,” continued Servadac, “we will take the shortest way back to\r\nthe gourbi, and see what our horses think about it all.”\r\n\r\n“They will think that they ought to be groomed,” said the orderly.\r\n\r\n“Very good; you may groom them and saddle them as quickly as you like.\r\nI want to know what has become of the rest of Algeria: if we cannot get\r\nround by the south to Mostaganem, we must go eastwards to Tenes.” And\r\nforthwith they started. Beginning to feel hungry, they had no hesitation\r\nin gathering figs, dates, and oranges from the plantations that formed a\r\ncontinuous rich and luxuriant orchard along their path. The district was\r\nquite deserted, and they had no reason to fear any legal penalty.\r\n\r\nIn an hour and a half they reached the gourbi. Everything was just as\r\nthey had left it, and it was evident that no one had visited the place\r\nduring their absence. All was desolate as the shore they had quitted.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the expedition were brief and simple. Ben Zoof\r\nsaddled the horses and filled his pouch with biscuits and game; water,\r\nhe felt certain, could be obtained in abundance from the numerous\r\naffluents of the Shelif, which, although they had now become tributaries\r\nof the Mediterranean, still meandered through the plain. Captain\r\nServadac mounted his horse Zephyr, and Ben Zoof simultaneously got\r\nastride his mare Galette, named after the mill of Montmartre. They\r\ngalloped off in the direction of the Shelif, and were not long in\r\ndiscovering that the diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nhad precisely the same effect upon their horses as it had had upon\r\nthemselves. Their muscular strength seemed five times as great as\r\nhitherto; their hoofs scarcely touched the ground, and they seemed\r\ntransformed from ordinary quadrupeds into veritable hippogriffs.\r\nHappily, Servadac and his orderly were fearless riders; they made no\r\nattempt to curb their steeds, but even urged them to still greater\r\nexertions. Twenty minutes sufficed to carry them over the four or five\r\nmiles that intervened between the gourbi and the mouth of the Shelif;\r\nthen, slackening their speed, they proceeded at a more leisurely pace to\r\nthe southeast, along what had once been the right bank of the river, but\r\nwhich, although it still retained its former characteristics, was now\r\nthe boundary of a sea, which extending farther than the limits of the\r\nhorizon, must have swallowed up at least a large portion of the province\r\nof Oran. Captain Servadac knew the country well; he had at one time been\r\nengaged upon a trigonometrical survey of the district, and consequently\r\nhad an accurate knowledge of its topography. His idea now was to draw up\r\na report of his investigations: to whom that report should be delivered\r\nwas a problem he had yet to solve.\r\n\r\nDuring the four hours of daylight that still remained, the travelers\r\nrode about twenty-one miles from the river mouth. To their vast\r\nsurprise, they did not meet a single human being. At nightfall they\r\nagain encamped in a slight bend of the shore, at a point which on the\r\nprevious evening had faced the mouth of the Mina, one of the left-hand\r\naffluents of the Shelif, but now absorbed into the newly revealed\r\nocean. Ben Zoof made the sleeping accommodation as comfortable as the\r\ncircumstances would allow; the horses were clogged and turned out to\r\nfeed upon the rich pasture that clothed the shore, and the night passed\r\nwithout special incident.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the following morning, the 2nd of January, or what,\r\naccording to the ordinary calendar, would have been the night of the\r\n1st, the captain and his orderly remounted their horses, and during the\r\nsix-hours’ day accomplished a distance of forty-two miles. The right\r\nbank of the river still continued to be the margin of the land, and only\r\nin one spot had its integrity been impaired. This was about twelve miles\r\nfrom the Mina, and on the site of the annex or suburb of Surkelmittoo.\r\nHere a large portion of the bank had been swept away, and the hamlet,\r\nwith its eight hundred inhabitants, had no doubt been swallowed up by\r\nthe encroaching waters. It seemed, therefore, more than probable that a\r\nsimilar fate had overtaken the larger towns beyond the Shelif.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the explorers encamped, as previously, in a nook of the\r\nshore which here abruptly terminated their new domain, not far from\r\nwhere they might have expected to find the important village of\r\nMemounturroy; but of this, too, there was now no trace. “I had quite\r\nreckoned upon a supper and a bed at Orleansville to-night,” said\r\nServadac, as, full of despondency, he surveyed the waste of water.\r\n\r\n“Quite impossible,” replied Ben Zoof, “except you had gone by a boat.\r\nBut cheer up, sir, cheer up; we will soon devise some means for getting\r\nacross to Mostaganem.”\r\n\r\n“If, as I hope,” rejoined the captain, “we are on a peninsula, we are\r\nmore likely to get to Tenes; there we shall hear the news.”\r\n\r\n“Far more likely to carry the news ourselves,” answered Ben Zoof, as he\r\nthrew himself down for his night’s rest.\r\n\r\nSix hours later, only waiting for sunrise, Captain Servadac set himself\r\nin movement again to renew his investigations. At this spot the shore,\r\nthat hitherto had been running in a southeasterly direction, turned\r\nabruptly to the north, being no longer formed by the natural bank of the\r\nShelif, but consisting of an absolutely new coast-line. No land was in\r\nsight. Nothing could be seen of Orleansville, which ought to have been\r\nabout six miles to the southwest; and Ben Zoof, who had mounted the\r\nhighest point of view attainable, could distinguish sea, and nothing but\r\nsea, to the farthest horizon.\r\n\r\nQuitting their encampment and riding on, the bewildered explorers kept\r\nclose to the new shore. This, since it had ceased to be formed by the\r\noriginal river bank, had considerably altered its aspect. Frequent\r\nlandslips occurred, and in many places deep chasms rifted the ground;\r\ngreat gaps furrowed the fields, and trees, half uprooted, overhung the\r\nwater, remarkable by the fantastic distortions of their gnarled trunks,\r\nlooking as though they had been chopped by a hatchet.\r\n\r\nThe sinuosities of the coast line, alternately gully and headland,\r\nhad the effect of making a devious progress for the travelers, and at\r\nsunset, although they had accomplished more than twenty miles, they had\r\nonly just arrived at the foot of the Merdeyah Mountains, which, before\r\nthe cataclysm, had formed the extremity of the chain of the Little\r\nAtlas. The ridge, however, had been violently ruptured, and now rose\r\nperpendicularly from the water.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Servadac and Ben Zoof traversed one of the\r\nmountain gorges; and next, in order to make a more thorough acquaintance\r\nwith the limits and condition of the section of Algerian territory of\r\nwhich they seemed to be left as the sole occupants, they dismounted, and\r\nproceeded on foot to the summit of one of the highest peaks. From this\r\nelevation they ascertained that from the base of the Merdeyah to the\r\nMediterranean, a distance of about eighteen miles, a new coast line had\r\ncome into existence; no land was visible in any direction; no isthmus\r\nexisted to form a connecting link with the territory of Tenes, which had\r\nentirely disappeared. The result was that Captain Servadac was driven\r\nto the irresistible conclusion that the tract of land which he had been\r\nsurveying was not, as he had at first imagined, a peninsula; it was\r\nactually an island.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, this island was quadrilateral, but the sides were so\r\nirregular that it was much more nearly a triangle, the comparison of the\r\nsides exhibiting these proportions: The section of the right bank of the\r\nShelif, seventy-two miles; the southern boundary from the Shelif to the\r\nchain of the Little Atlas, twenty-one miles; from the Little Atlas to\r\nthe Mediterranean, eighteen miles; and sixty miles of the shore of the\r\nMediterranean itself, making in all an entire circumference of about 171\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n“What does it all mean?” exclaimed the captain, every hour growing more\r\nand more bewildered.\r\n\r\n“The will of Providence, and we must submit,” replied Ben Zoof, calm and\r\nundisturbed. With this reflection, the two men silently descended the\r\nmountain and remounted their horses. Before evening they had reached\r\nthe Mediterranean. On their road they failed to discern a vestige of the\r\nlittle town of Montenotte; like Tenes, of which not so much as a ruined\r\ncottage was visible on the horizon, it seemed to be annihilated.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 6th of January, the two men made a forced\r\nmarch along the coast of the Mediterranean, which they found less\r\naltered than the captain had at first supposed; but four villages had\r\nentirely disappeared, and the headlands, unable to resist the shock of\r\nthe convulsion, had been detached from the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe circuit of the island had been now completed, and the explorers,\r\nafter a period of sixty hours, found themselves once more beside the\r\nruins of their gourbi. Five days, or what, according to the established\r\norder of things, would have been two days and a half, had been occupied\r\nin tracing the boundaries of their new domain; and they had ascertained\r\nbeyond a doubt that they were the sole human inhabitants left upon the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, here you are, Governor General of Algeria!” exclaimed Ben\r\nZoof, as they reached the gourbi.\r\n\r\n“With not a soul to govern,” gloomily rejoined the captain.\r\n\r\n“How so? Do you not reckon me?”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! Ben Zoof, what are you?”\r\n\r\n“What am I? Why, I am the population.”\r\n\r\nThe captain deigned no reply, but, muttering some expressions of regret\r\nfor the fruitless trouble he had taken about his rondo, betook himself\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. BEN ZOOF WATCHES IN VAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the governor general and his population were asleep.\r\nThe gourbi being in ruins, they were obliged to put up with the best\r\naccommodation they could find in the adjacent erection. It must be owned\r\nthat the captain’s slumbers were by no means sound; he was agitated by\r\nthe consciousness that he had hitherto been unable to account for his\r\nstrange experiences by any reasonable theory. Though far from being\r\nadvanced in the knowledge of natural philosophy, he had been instructed,\r\nto a certain degree, in its elementary principles; and, by an effort\r\nof memory, he managed to recall some general laws which he had almost\r\nforgotten. He could understand that an altered inclination of the\r\nearth’s axis with regard to the ecliptic would introduce a change of\r\nposition in the cardinal points, and bring about a displacement of\r\nthe sea; but the hypothesis entirely failed to account, either for the\r\nshortening of the days, or for the diminution in the pressure of the\r\natmosphere. He felt that his judgment was utterly baffled; his only\r\nremaining hope was that the chain of marvels was not yet complete, and\r\nthat something farther might throw some light upon the mystery.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof’s first care on the following morning was to provide a\r\ngood breakfast. To use his own phrase, he was as hungry as the\r\nwhole population of three million Algerians, of whom he was the\r\nrepresentative, and he must have enough to eat. The catastrophe which\r\nhad overwhelmed the country had left a dozen eggs uninjured, and upon\r\nthese, with a good dish of his famous couscous, he hoped that he and his\r\nmaster might have a sufficiently substantial meal. The stove was ready\r\nfor use, the copper skillet was as bright as hands could make it, and\r\nthe beads of condensed steam upon the surface of a large stone al-caraza\r\ngave evidence that it was supplied with water. Ben Zoof at once lighted\r\na fire, singing all the time, according to his wont, a snatch of an old\r\nmilitary refrain.\r\n\r\nEver on the lookout for fresh phenomena, Captain Servadac watched the\r\npreparations with a curious eye. It struck him that perhaps the air,\r\nin its strangely modified condition, would fail to supply sufficient\r\noxygen, and that the stove, in consequence, might not fulfill its\r\nfunction. But no; the fire was lighted just as usual, and fanned into\r\nvigor by Ben Zoof applying his mouth in lieu of bellows, and a bright\r\nflame started up from the midst of the twigs and coal. The skillet was\r\nduly set upon the stove, and Ben Zoof was prepared to wait awhile for\r\nthe water to boil. Taking up the eggs, he was surprised to notice that\r\nthey hardly weighed more than they would if they had been mere shells;\r\nbut he was still more surprised when he saw that before the water had\r\nbeen two minutes over the fire it was at full boil.\r\n\r\n“By jingo!” he exclaimed, “a precious hot fire!”\r\n\r\nServadac reflected. “It cannot be that the fire is hotter,” he said,\r\n“the peculiarity must be in the water.” And taking down a centigrade\r\nthermometer, which hung upon the wall, he plunged it into the skillet.\r\nInstead of 100 degrees, the instrument registered only 66 degrees.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice, Ben Zoof,” he said; “leave your eggs in the saucepan a\r\ngood quarter of an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Boil them hard! That will never do,” objected the orderly.\r\n\r\n“You will not find them hard, my good fellow. Trust me, we shall be able\r\nto dip our sippets into the yolks easily enough.”\r\n\r\nThe captain was quite right in his conjecture, that this new phenomenon\r\nwas caused by a diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere. Water\r\nboiling at a temperature of 66 degrees was itself an evidence that the\r\ncolumn of air above the earth’s surface had become reduced by one-third\r\nof its altitude. The identical phenomenon would have occurred at\r\nthe summit of a mountain 35,000 feet high; and had Servadac been in\r\npossession of a barometer, he would have immediately discovered the fact\r\nthat only now for the first time, as the result of experiment, revealed\r\nitself to him--a fact, moreover, which accounted for the compression of\r\nthe blood-vessels which both he and Ben Zoof had experienced, as well\r\nas for the attenuation of their voices and their accelerated breathing.\r\n“And yet,” he argued with himself, “if our encampment has been projected\r\nto so great an elevation, how is it that the sea remains at its proper\r\nlevel?”\r\n\r\nOnce again Hector Servadac, though capable of tracing consequences, felt\r\nhimself totally at a loss to comprehend their cause; hence his agitation\r\nand bewilderment!\r\n\r\nAfter their prolonged immersion in the boiling water, the eggs were\r\nfound to be only just sufficiently cooked; the couscous was very much in\r\nthe same condition; and Ben Zoof came to the conclusion that in future\r\nhe must be careful to commence his culinary operations an hour earlier.\r\nHe was rejoiced at last to help his master, who, in spite of his\r\nperplexed preoccupation, seemed to have a very fair appetite for\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n“Well, captain?” said Ben Zoof presently, such being his ordinary way of\r\nopening conversation.\r\n\r\n“Well, Ben Zoof?” was the captain’s invariable response to his servant’s\r\nformula.\r\n\r\n“What are we to do now, sir?”\r\n\r\n“We can only for the present wait patiently where we are. We are\r\nencamped upon an island, and therefore we can only be rescued by sea.”\r\n\r\n“But do you suppose that any of our friends are still alive?” asked Ben\r\nZoof.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think we must indulge the hope that this catastrophe has not\r\nextended far. We must trust that it has limited its mischief to some\r\nsmall portion of the Algerian coast, and that our friends are all alive\r\nand well. No doubt the governor general will be anxious to investigate\r\nthe full extent of the damage, and will send a vessel from Algiers to\r\nexplore. It is not likely that we shall be forgotten. What, then, you\r\nhave to do, Ben Zoof, is to keep a sharp lookout, and to be ready, in\r\ncase a vessel should appear, to make signals at once.”\r\n\r\n“But if no vessel should appear!” sighed the orderly.\r\n\r\n“Then we must build a boat, and go in search of those who do not come in\r\nsearch of us.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. But what sort of a sailor are you?”\r\n\r\n“Everyone can be a sailor when he must,” said Servadac calmly.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof said no more. For several succeeding days he scanned the\r\nhorizon unintermittently with his telescope. His watching was in vain.\r\nNo ship appeared upon the desert sea. “By the name of a Kabyle!” he\r\nbroke out impatiently, “his Excellency is grossly negligent!”\r\n\r\nAlthough the days and nights had become reduced from twenty-four hours\r\nto twelve, Captain Servadac would not accept the new condition of\r\nthings, but resolved to adhere to the computations of the old calendar.\r\nNotwithstanding, therefore, that the sun had risen and set twelve times\r\nsince the commencement of the new year, he persisted in calling the\r\nfollowing day the 6th of January. His watch enabled him to keep an\r\naccurate account of the passing hours.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his life, Ben Zoof had read a few books. After\r\npondering one day, he said: “It seems to me, captain, that you have\r\nturned into Robinson Crusoe, and that I am your man Friday. I hope I\r\nhave not become a negro.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the captain. “Your complexion isn’t the fairest in the\r\nworld, but you are not black yet.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I had much sooner be a white Friday than a black one,” rejoined\r\nBen Zoof.\r\n\r\nStill no ship appeared; and Captain Servadac, after the example of all\r\nprevious Crusoes, began to consider it advisable to investigate the\r\nresources of his domain. The new territory of which he had become the\r\nmonarch he named Gourbi Island. It had a superficial area of about\r\nnine hundred square miles. Bullocks, cows, goats, and sheep existed in\r\nconsiderable numbers; and as there seemed already to be an abundance\r\nof game, it was hardly likely that a future supply would fail them. The\r\ncondition of the cereals was such as to promise a fine ingathering of\r\nwheat, maize, and rice; so that for the governor and his population,\r\nwith their two horses, not only was there ample provision, but even if\r\nother human inhabitants besides themselves should yet be discovered,\r\nthere was not the remotest prospect of any of them perishing by\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nFrom the 6th to the 13th of January the rain came down in torrents; and,\r\nwhat was quite an unusual occurrence at this season of the year, several\r\nheavy storms broke over the island. In spite, however, of the continual\r\ndownfall, the heavens still remained veiled in cloud. Servadac,\r\nmoreover, did not fail to observe that for the season the temperature\r\nwas unusually high; and, as a matter still more surprising, that it kept\r\nsteadily increasing, as though the earth were gradually and continuously\r\napproximating to the sun. In proportion to the rise of temperature, the\r\nlight also assumed greater intensity; and if it had not been for\r\nthe screen of vapor interposed between the sky and the island, the\r\nirradiation which would have illumined all terrestrial objects would\r\nhave been vivid beyond all precedent.\r\n\r\nBut neither sun, moon, nor star ever appeared; and Servadac’s irritation\r\nand annoyance at being unable to identify any one point of the firmament\r\nmay be more readily imagined than described. On one occasion Ben Zoof\r\nendeavored to mitigate his master’s impatience by exhorting him to\r\nassume the resignation, even if he did not feel the indifference, which\r\nhe himself experienced; but his advice was received with so angry a\r\nrebuff that he retired in all haste, abashed, to résumé his watchman’s\r\nduty, which he performed with exemplary perseverance. Day and night,\r\nwith the shortest possible intervals of rest, despite wind, rain, and\r\nstorm, he mounted guard upon the cliff--but all in vain. Not a speck\r\nappeared upon the desolate horizon. To say the truth, no vessel could\r\nhave stood against the weather. The hurricane raged with tremendous\r\nfury, and the waves rose to a height that seemed to defy calculation.\r\nNever, even in the second era of creation, when, under the influence of\r\ninternal heat, the waters rose in vapor to descend in deluge back upon\r\nthe world, could meteorological phenomena have been developed with more\r\nimpressive intensity.\r\n\r\nBut by the night of the 13th the tempest appeared to have spent its\r\nfury; the wind dropped; the rain ceased as if by a spell; and Servadac,\r\nwho for the last six days had confined himself to the shelter of his\r\nroof, hastened to join Ben Zoof at his post upon the cliff. Now, he\r\nthought, there might be a chance of solving his perplexity; perhaps now\r\nthe huge disc, of which he had had an imperfect glimpse on the night of\r\nthe 31st of December, might again reveal itself; at any rate, he hoped\r\nfor an opportunity of observing the constellations in a clear firmament\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe night was magnificent. Not a cloud dimmed the luster of the stars,\r\nwhich spangled the heavens in surpassing brilliancy, and several nebulae\r\nwhich hitherto no astronomer had been able to discern without the aid of\r\na telescope were clearly visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nBy a natural impulse, Servadac’s first thought was to observe the\r\nposition of the pole-star. It was in sight, but so near to the horizon\r\nas to suggest the utter impossibility of its being any longer the\r\ncentral pivot of the sidereal system; it occupied a position through\r\nwhich it was out of the question that the axis of the earth indefinitely\r\nprolonged could ever pass. In his impression he was more thoroughly\r\nconfirmed when, an hour later, he noticed that the star had approached\r\nstill nearer the horizon, as though it had belonged to one of the\r\nzodiacal constellations.\r\n\r\nThe pole-star being manifestly thus displaced, it remained to be\r\ndiscovered whether any other of the celestial bodies had become a\r\nfixed center around which the constellations made their apparent daily\r\nrevolutions. To the solution of this problem Servadac applied himself\r\nwith the most thoughtful diligence. After patient observation, he\r\nsatisfied himself that the required conditions were answered by a\r\ncertain star that was stationary not far from the horizon. This\r\nwas Vega, in the constellation Lyra, a star which, according to the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, will take the place of our pole-star 12,000\r\nyears hence. The most daring imagination could not suppose that a period\r\nof 12,000 years had been crowded into the space of a fortnight; and\r\ntherefore the captain came, as to an easier conclusion, to the opinion\r\nthat the earth’s axis had been suddenly and immensely shifted; and\r\nfrom the fact that the axis, if produced, would pass through a point\r\nso little removed above the horizon, he deduced the inference that the\r\nMediterranean must have been transported to the equator.\r\n\r\nLost in bewildering maze of thought, he gazed long and intently upon the\r\nheavens. His eyes wandered from where the tail of the Great Bear, now a\r\nzodiacal constellation, was scarcely visible above the waters, to where\r\nthe stars of the southern hemisphere were just breaking on his view. A\r\ncry from Ben Zoof recalled him to himself.\r\n\r\n“The moon!” shouted the orderly, as though overjoyed at once again\r\nbeholding what the poet has called:\r\n\r\n     “The kind companion of terrestrial night;”\r\n\r\nand he pointed to a disc that was rising at a spot precisely opposite\r\nthe place where they would have expected to see the sun. “The moon!”\r\n again he cried.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Servadac could not altogether enter into his servant’s\r\nenthusiasm. If this were actually the moon, her distance from the\r\nearth must have been increased by some millions of miles. He was rather\r\ndisposed to suspect that it was not the earth’s satellite at all,\r\nbut some planet with its apparent magnitude greatly enlarged by its\r\napproximation to the earth. Taking up the powerful field-glass which\r\nhe was accustomed to use in his surveying operations, he proceeded to\r\ninvestigate more carefully the luminous orb. But he failed to trace\r\nany of the lineaments, supposed to resemble a human face, that mark the\r\nlunar surface; he failed to decipher any indications of hill and plain;\r\nnor could he make out the aureole of light which emanates from what\r\nastronomers have designated Mount Tycho. “It is not the moon,” he said\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n“Not the moon?” cried Ben Zoof. “Why not?”\r\n\r\n“It is not the moon,” again affirmed the captain.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” repeated Ben Zoof, unwilling to renounce his first\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n“Because there is a small satellite in attendance.” And the captain drew\r\nhis servant’s attention to a bright speck, apparently about the size of\r\none of Jupiter’s satellites seen through a moderate telescope, that was\r\nclearly visible just within the focus of his glass.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a fresh mystery. The orbit of this planet was assuredly\r\ninterior to the orbit of the earth, because it accompanied the sun\r\nin its apparent motion; yet it was neither Mercury nor Venus, because\r\nneither one nor the other of these has any satellite at all.\r\n\r\nThe captain stamped and stamped again with mingled vexation, agitation,\r\nand bewilderment. “Confound it!” he cried, “if this is neither Venus nor\r\nMercury, it must be the moon; but if it is the moon, whence, in the name\r\nof all the gods, has she picked up another moon for herself?”\r\n\r\nThe captain was in dire perplexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. VENUS IN PERILOUS PROXIMITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light of the returning sun soon extinguished the glory of the stars,\r\nand rendered it necessary for the captain to postpone his observations.\r\nHe had sought in vain for further trace of the huge disc that had so\r\nexcited his wonder on the 1st, and it seemed most probable that, in its\r\nirregular orbit, it had been carried beyond the range of vision.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still superb. The wind, after veering to the west, had\r\nsunk to a perfect calm. Pursuing its inverted course, the sun rose and\r\nset with undeviating regularity; and the days and nights were still\r\ndivided into periods of precisely six hours each--a sure proof that the\r\nsun remained close to the new equator which manifestly passed through\r\nGourbi Island.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the temperature was steadily increasing. The captain kept his\r\nthermometer close at hand where he could repeatedly consult it, and on\r\nthe 15th he found that it registered 50 degrees centigrade in the shade.\r\n\r\nNo attempt had been made to rebuild the gourbi, but the captain and\r\nBen Zoof managed to make up quarters sufficiently comfortable in the\r\nprincipal apartment of the adjoining structure, where the stone walls,\r\nthat at first afforded a refuge from the torrents of rain, now formed an\r\nequally acceptable shelter from the burning sun. The heat was becoming\r\ninsufferable, surpassing the heat of Senegal and other equatorial\r\nregions; not a cloud ever tempered the intensity of the solar rays;\r\nand unless some modification ensued, it seemed inevitable that all\r\nvegetation should become scorched and burnt off from the face of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of the profuse perspirations from which he suffered,\r\nBen Zoof, constant to his principles, expressed no surprise at the\r\nunwonted heat. No remonstrances from his master could induce him to\r\nabandon his watch from the cliff. To withstand the vertical beams of\r\nthat noontide sun would seem to require a skin of brass and a brain\r\nof adamant; but yet, hour after hour, he would remain conscientiously\r\nscanning the surface of the Mediterranean, which, calm and deserted, lay\r\noutstretched before him. On one occasion, Servadac, in reference to his\r\norderly’s indomitable perseverance, happened to remark that he thought\r\nhe must have been born in the heart of equatorial Africa; to which Ben\r\nZoof replied, with the utmost dignity, that he was born at Montmartre,\r\nwhich was all the same. The worthy fellow was unwilling to own that,\r\neven in the matter of heat, the tropics could in any way surpass his own\r\nmuch-loved home.\r\n\r\nThis unprecedented temperature very soon began to take effect upon the\r\nproducts of the soil. The sap rose rapidly in the trees, so that in the\r\ncourse of a few days buds, leaves, flowers, and fruit had come to full\r\nmaturity. It was the same with the cereals; wheat and maize sprouted and\r\nripened as if by magic, and for a while a rank and luxuriant pasturage\r\nclothed the meadows. Summer and autumn seemed blended into one. If\r\nCaptain Servadac had been more deeply versed in astronomy, he would\r\nperhaps have been able to bring to bear his knowledge that if the axis\r\nof the earth, as everything seemed to indicate, now formed a right angle\r\nwith the plane of the ecliptic, her various seasons, like those of the\r\nplanet Jupiter, would become limited to certain zones, in which they\r\nwould remain invariable. But even if he had understood the _rationale_\r\nof the change, the convulsion that had brought it about would have been\r\nas much a mystery as ever.\r\n\r\nThe precocity of vegetation caused some embarrassment. The time for\r\nthe corn and fruit harvest had fallen simultaneously with that of the\r\nhaymaking; and as the extreme heat precluded any prolonged exertions,\r\nit was evident “the population” of the island would find it difficult to\r\nprovide the necessary amount of labor. Not that the prospect gave\r\nthem much concern: the provisions of the gourbi were still far from\r\nexhausted, and now that the roughness of the weather had so happily\r\nsubsided, they had every encouragement to hope that a ship of some\r\nsort would soon appear. Not only was that part of the Mediterranean\r\nsystematically frequented by the government steamers that watched the\r\ncoast, but vessels of all nations were constantly cruising off the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of all their sanguine speculations, no ship appeared.\r\nBen Zoof admitted the necessity of extemporizing a kind of parasol for\r\nhimself, otherwise he must literally have been roasted to death upon the\r\nexposed summit of the cliff.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Servadac was doing his utmost--it must be acknowledged, with\r\nindifferent success--to recall the lessons of his school-days. He would\r\nplunge into the wildest speculations in his endeavors to unravel\r\nthe difficulties of the new situation, and struggled into a kind of\r\nconviction that if there had been a change of manner in the earth’s\r\nrotation on her axis, there would be a corresponding change in her\r\nrevolution round the sun, which would involve the consequence of the\r\nlength of the year being either diminished or increased.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the increased and increasing heat, there was another\r\nvery conclusive demonstration that the earth had thus suddenly\r\napproximated towards the sun. The diameter of the solar disc was now\r\nexactly twice what it ordinarily looks to the naked eye; in fact, it was\r\nprecisely such as it would appear to an observer on the surface of the\r\nplanet Venus. The most obvious inference would therefore be that the\r\nearth’s distance from the sun had been diminished from 91,000,000 to\r\n66,000,000 miles. If the just equilibrium of the earth had thus been\r\ndestroyed, and should this diminution of distance still continue, would\r\nthere not be reason to fear that the terrestrial world would be carried\r\nonwards to actual contact with the sun, which must result in its total\r\nannihilation?\r\n\r\nThe continuance of the splendid weather afforded Servadac every facility\r\nfor observing the heavens. Night after night, constellations in\r\ntheir beauty lay stretched before his eyes--an alphabet which, to his\r\nmortification, not to say his rage, he was unable to decipher. In the\r\napparent dimensions of the fixed stars, in their distance, in their\r\nrelative position with regard to each other, he could observe no change.\r\nAlthough it is established that our sun is approaching the constellation\r\nof Hercules at the rate of more than 126,000,000 miles a year, and\r\nalthough Arcturus is traveling through space at the rate of fifty-four\r\nmiles a second--three times faster than the earth goes round the\r\nsun,--yet such is the remoteness of those stars that no appreciable\r\nchange is evident to the senses. The fixed stars taught him nothing.\r\n\r\nFar otherwise was it with the planets. The orbits of Venus and Mercury\r\nare within the orbit of the earth, Venus rotating at an average distance\r\nof 66,130,000 miles from the sun, and Mercury at that of 35,393,000.\r\nAfter pondering long, and as profoundly as he could, upon these figures,\r\nCaptain Servadac came to the conclusion that, as the earth was now\r\nreceiving about double the amount of light and heat that it had been\r\nreceiving before the catastrophe, it was receiving about the same as the\r\nplanet Venus; he was driven, therefore, to the estimate of the measure\r\nin which the earth must have approximated to the sun, a deduction in\r\nwhich he was confirmed when the opportunity came for him to observe\r\nVenus herself in the splendid proportions that she now assumed.\r\n\r\nThat magnificent planet which--as Phosphorus or Lucifer, Hesperus or\r\nVesper, the evening star, the morning star, or the shepherd’s star--has\r\nnever failed to attract the rapturous admiration of the most indifferent\r\nobservers, here revealed herself with unprecedented glory, exhibiting\r\nall the phases of a lustrous moon in miniature. Various indentations in\r\nthe outline of its crescent showed that the solar beams were refracted\r\ninto regions of its surface where the sun had already set, and proved,\r\nbeyond a doubt, that the planet had an atmosphere of her own; and\r\ncertain luminous points projecting from the crescent as plainly marked\r\nthe existence of mountains. As the result of Servadac’s computations, he\r\nformed the opinion that Venus could hardly be at a greater distance than\r\n6,000,000 miles from the earth.\r\n\r\n“And a very safe distance, too,” said Ben Zoof, when his master told him\r\nthe conclusion at which he had arrived.\r\n\r\n“All very well for two armies, but for a couple of planets not quite so\r\nsafe, perhaps, as you may imagine. It is my impression that it is more\r\nthan likely we may run foul of Venus,” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“Plenty of air and water there, sir?” inquired the orderly.\r\n\r\n“Yes; as far as I can tell, plenty,” replied Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Then why shouldn’t we go and visit Venus?”\r\n\r\nServadac did his best to explain that as the two planets were of\r\nabout equal volume, and were traveling with great velocity in opposite\r\ndirections, any collision between them must be attended with the most\r\ndisastrous consequences to one or both of them. But Ben Zoof failed to\r\nsee that, even at the worst, the catastrophe could be much more serious\r\nthan the collision of two railway trains.\r\n\r\nThe captain became exasperated. “You idiot!” he angrily exclaimed;\r\n“cannot you understand that the planets are traveling a thousand times\r\nfaster than the fastest express, and that if they meet, either one\r\nor the other must be destroyed? What would become of your darling\r\nMontmartre then?”\r\n\r\nThe captain had touched a tender chord. For a moment Ben Zoof stood with\r\nclenched teeth and contracted muscles; then, in a voice of real concern,\r\nhe inquired whether anything could be done to avert the calamity.\r\n\r\n“Nothing whatever; so you may go about your own business,” was the\r\ncaptain’s brusque rejoinder.\r\n\r\nAll discomfited and bewildered, Ben Zoof retired without a word.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing days the distance between the two planets continued\r\nto decrease, and it became more and more obvious that the earth, on her\r\nnew orbit, was about to cross the orbit of Venus. Throughout this time\r\nthe earth had been making a perceptible approach towards Mercury, and\r\nthat planet--which is rarely visible to the naked eye, and then only\r\nat what are termed the periods of its greatest eastern and western\r\nelongations--now appeared in all its splendor. It amply justified the\r\nepithet of “sparkling” which the ancients were accustomed to confer\r\nupon it, and could scarcely fail to awaken a new interest. The periodic\r\nrecurrence of its phases; its reflection of the sun’s rays, shedding\r\nupon it a light and a heat seven times greater than that received by the\r\nearth; its glacial and its torrid zones, which, on account of the great\r\ninclination of the axis, are scarcely separable; its equatorial bands;\r\nits mountains eleven miles high;--were all subjects of observation\r\nworthy of the most studious regard.\r\n\r\nBut no danger was to be apprehended from Mercury; with Venus only did\r\ncollision appear imminent. By the 18th of January the distance between\r\nthat planet and the earth had become reduced to between two and three\r\nmillions of miles, and the intensity of its light cast heavy shadows\r\nfrom all terrestrial objects. It might be observed to turn upon its own\r\naxis in twenty-three hours twenty-one minutes--an evidence, from the\r\nunaltered duration of its days, that the planet had not shared in the\r\ndisturbance. On its disc the clouds formed from its atmospheric vapor\r\nwere plainly perceptible, as also were the seven spots, which, according\r\nto Bianchini, are a chain of seas. It was now visible in broad daylight.\r\nBuonaparte, when under the Directory, once had his attention called to\r\nVenus at noon, and immediately hailed it joyfully, recognizing it as\r\nhis own peculiar star in the ascendant. Captain Servadac, it may well be\r\nimagined, did not experience the same gratifying emotion.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, the distance between the two bodies had again sensibly\r\ndiminished. The captain had ceased to be surprised that no vessel\r\nhad been sent to rescue himself and his companion from their strange\r\nimprisonment; the governor general and the minister of war were\r\ndoubtless far differently occupied, and their interests far otherwise\r\nengrossed. What sensational articles, he thought, must now be teeming to\r\nthe newspapers! What crowds must be flocking to the churches! The end\r\nof the world approaching! the great climax close at hand! Two days more,\r\nand the earth, shivered into a myriad atoms, would be lost in boundless\r\nspace!\r\n\r\nThese dire forebodings, however, were not destined to be realized.\r\nGradually the distance between the two planets began to increase; the\r\nplanes of their orbits did not coincide, and accordingly the dreaded\r\ncatastrophe did not ensue. By the 25th, Venus was sufficiently remote to\r\npreclude any further fear of collision. Ben Zoof gave a sigh of relief\r\nwhen the captain communicated the glad intelligence.\r\n\r\nTheir proximity to Venus had been close enough to demonstrate that\r\nbeyond a doubt that planet has no moon or satellite such as Cassini,\r\nShort, Montaigne of Limoges, Montbarron, and some other astronomers have\r\nimagined to exist. “Had there been such a satellite,” said Servadac,\r\n“we might have captured it in passing. But what can be the meaning,” he\r\nadded seriously, “of all this displacement of the heavenly bodies?”\r\n\r\n“What is that great building at Paris, captain, with a top like a cap?”\r\n asked Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean the Observatory?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the Observatory. Are there not people living in the Observatory\r\nwho could explain all this?”\r\n\r\n“Very likely; but what of that?”\r\n\r\n“Let us be philosophers, and wait patiently until we can hear their\r\nexplanation.”\r\n\r\nServadac smiled. “Do you know what it is to be a philosopher, Ben Zoof?”\r\n he asked.\r\n\r\n“I am a soldier, sir,” was the servant’s prompt rejoinder, “and I have\r\nlearnt to know that ‘what can’t be cured must be endured.’”\r\n\r\nThe captain made no reply, but for a time, at least, he desisted from\r\npuzzling himself over matters which he felt he was utterly incompetent\r\nto explain. But an event soon afterwards occurred which awakened his\r\nkeenest interest.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock on the morning of the 27th, Ben Zoof walked\r\ndeliberately into his master’s apartment, and, in reply to a question as\r\nto what he wanted, announced with the utmost composure that a ship was\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\n“A ship!” exclaimed Servadac, starting to his feet. “A ship! Ben Zoof,\r\nyou donkey! you speak as unconcernedly as though you were telling me\r\nthat my dinner was ready.”\r\n\r\n“Are we not philosophers, captain?” said the orderly.\r\n\r\nBut the captain was out of hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. INQUIRIES UNSATISFIED\r\n\r\n\r\nFast as his legs could carry him, Servadac had made his way to the top\r\nof the cliff. It was quite true that a vessel was in sight, hardly more\r\nthan six miles from the shore; but owing to the increase in the earth’s\r\nconvexity, and the consequent limitation of the range of vision, the\r\nrigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water. This was\r\nenough, however, to indicate that the ship was a schooner--an impression\r\nthat was confirmed when, two hours later, she came entirely in sight.\r\n\r\n“The _Dobryna_!” exclaimed Servadac, keeping his eye unmoved at his\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n“Impossible, sir!” rejoined Ben Zoof; “there are no signs of smoke.”\r\n\r\n“The _Dobryna_!” repeated the captain, positively. “She is under sail;\r\nbut she is Count Timascheff’s yacht.”\r\n\r\nHe was right. If the count were on board, a strange fatality was\r\nbringing him to the presence of his rival. But no longer now could\r\nServadac regard him in the light of an adversary; circumstances had\r\nchanged, and all animosity was absorbed in the eagerness with which\r\nhe hailed the prospect of obtaining some information about the recent\r\nstartling and inexplicable events. During the twenty-seven days that she\r\nhad been absent, the _Dobryna_, he conjectured, would have explored the\r\nMediterranean, would very probably have visited Spain, France, or Italy,\r\nand accordingly would convey to Gourbi Island some intelligence from\r\none or other of those countries. He reckoned, therefore, not only upon\r\nascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe, but upon learning\r\nits cause. Count Timascheff was, no doubt, magnanimously coming to the\r\nrescue of himself and his orderly.\r\n\r\nThe wind being adverse, the _Dobryna_ did not make very rapid progress;\r\nbut as the weather, in spite of a few clouds, remained calm, and the\r\nsea was quite smooth, she was enabled to hold a steady course. It seemed\r\nunaccountable that she should not use her engine, as whoever was on\r\nboard, would be naturally impatient to reconnoiter the new island, which\r\nmust just have come within their view. The probability that suggested\r\nitself was that the schooner’s fuel was exhausted.\r\n\r\nServadac took it for granted that the _Dobryna_ was endeavoring to\r\nput in. It occurred to him, however, that the count, on discovering an\r\nisland where he had expected to find the mainland of Africa, would not\r\nunlikely be at a loss for a place of anchorage. The yacht was evidently\r\nmaking her way in the direction of the former mouth of the Shelif,\r\nand the captain was struck with the idea that he would do well to\r\ninvestigate whether there was any suitable mooring towards which he\r\nmight signal her. Zephyr and Galette were soon saddled, and in twenty\r\nminutes had carried their riders to the western extremity of the island,\r\nwhere they both dismounted and began to explore the coast.\r\n\r\nThey were not long in ascertaining that on the farther side of the\r\npoint there was a small well-sheltered creek of sufficient depth to\r\naccommodate a vessel of moderate tonnage. A narrow channel formed a\r\npassage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea,\r\nand which, even in the roughest weather, would ensure the calmness of\r\nits waters.\r\n\r\nWhilst examining the rocky shore, the captain observed, to his great\r\nsurprise, long and well-defined rows of seaweed, which undoubtedly\r\nbetokened that there had been a very considerable ebb and flow of the\r\nwaters--a thing unknown in the Mediterranean, where there is scarcely\r\nany perceptible tide. What, however, seemed most remarkable, was the\r\nmanifest evidence that ever since the highest flood (which was caused,\r\nin all probability, by the proximity of the body of which the huge\r\ndisc had been so conspicuous on the night of the 31st of December) the\r\nphenomenon had been gradually lessening, and in fact was now reduced to\r\nthe normal limits which had characterized it before the convulsion.\r\n\r\nWithout doing more than note the circumstance, Servadac turned his\r\nentire attention to the _Dobryna_, which, now little more than a mile\r\nfrom shore, could not fail to see and understand his signals. Slightly\r\nchanging her course, she first struck her mainsail, and, in order to\r\nfacilitate the movements of her helmsman, soon carried nothing but her\r\ntwo topsails, brigantine and jib. After rounding the peak, she steered\r\ndirect for the channel to which Servadac by his gestures was pointing\r\nher, and was not long in entering the creek. As soon as the anchor,\r\nimbedded in the sandy bottom, had made good its hold, a boat was\r\nlowered. In a few minutes more Count Timascheff had landed on the\r\nisland. Captain Servadac hastened towards him.\r\n\r\n“First of all, count,” he exclaimed impetuously, “before we speak one\r\nother word, tell me what has happened.”\r\n\r\nThe count, whose imperturbable composure presented a singular contrast\r\nto the French officer’s enthusiastic vivacity, made a stiff bow, and\r\nin his Russian accent replied: “First of all, permit me to express my\r\nsurprise at seeing you here. I left you on a continent, and here I have\r\nthe honor of finding you on an island.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you, count, I have never left the place.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite aware of it. Captain Servadac, and I now beg to offer you my\r\nsincere apologies for failing to keep my appointment with you.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, now,” interposed the captain; “we will talk of that\r\nby-and-by. First, tell me what has happened.”\r\n\r\n“The very question I was about to put to you, Captain Servadac.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say you know nothing of the cause, and can tell me\r\nnothing of the extent, of the catastrophe which has transformed this\r\npart of Africa into an island?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing more than you know yourself.”\r\n\r\n“But surely, Count Timascheff, you can inform me whether upon the\r\nnorthern shore of the Mediterranean--”\r\n\r\n“Are you certain that this is the Mediterranean?” asked the count\r\nsignificantly, and added, “I have discovered no sign of land.”\r\n\r\nThe captain stared in silent bewilderment. For some moments he seemed\r\nperfectly stupefied; then, recovering himself, he began to overwhelm the\r\ncount with a torrent of questions. Had he noticed, ever since the 1st\r\nof January, that the sun had risen in the west? Had he noticed that the\r\ndays had been only six hours long, and that the weight of the atmosphere\r\nwas so much diminished? Had he observed that the moon had quite\r\ndisappeared, and that the earth had been in imminent hazard of running\r\nfoul of the planet Venus? Was he aware, in short, that the entire\r\nmotions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification?\r\nTo all these inquiries, the count responded in the affirmative. He\r\nwas acquainted with everything that had transpired; but, to Servadac’s\r\nincreasing astonishment, he could throw no light upon the cause of any\r\nof the phenomena.\r\n\r\n“On the night of the 31st of December,” he said, “I was proceeding by\r\nsea to our appointed place of meeting, when my yacht was suddenly caught\r\non the crest of an enormous wave, and carried to a height which it\r\nis beyond my power to estimate. Some mysterious force seemed to have\r\nbrought about a convulsion of the elements. Our engine was damaged, nay\r\ndisabled, and we drifted entirely at the mercy of the terrible hurricane\r\nthat raged during the succeeding days. That the _Dobryna_ escaped at all\r\nis little less than a miracle, and I can only attribute her safety\r\nto the fact that she occupied the center of the vast cyclone, and\r\nconsequently did not experience much change of position.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and added: “Your island is the first land we have seen.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us put out to sea at once and ascertain the extent of the\r\ndisaster,” cried the captain, eagerly. “You will take me on board,\r\ncount, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“My yacht is at your service, sir, even should you require to make a\r\ntour round the world.”\r\n\r\n“A tour round the Mediterranean will suffice for the present, I think,”\r\n said the captain, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe count shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I am not sure,” said he, “but what the tour of the Mediterranean will\r\nprove to be the tour of the world.”\r\n\r\nServadac made no reply, but for a time remained silent and absorbed in\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAfter the silence was broken, they consulted as to what course was\r\nbest to pursue; and the plan they proposed was, in the first place, to\r\ndiscover how much of the African coast still remained, and to carry on\r\nthe tidings of their own experiences to Algiers; or, in the event of the\r\nsouthern shore having actually disappeared, they would make their way\r\nnorthwards and put themselves in communication with the population on\r\nthe river banks of Europe.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, it was indispensable that the engine of the _Dobryna_\r\nshould be repaired: to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds\r\nand rough seas be both tedious and difficult. The stock of coal on\r\nboard was adequate for two months’ consumption; but as it would at\r\nthe expiration of that time be exhausted, it was obviously the part\r\nof prudence to employ it in reaching a port where fuel could be\r\nreplenished.\r\n\r\nThe damage sustained by the engine proved to be not very serious; and\r\nin three days after her arrival the _Dobryna_ was again ready to put to\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nServadac employed the interval in making the count acquainted with\r\nall he knew about his small domain. They made an entire circuit of\r\nthe island, and both agreed that it must be beyond the limits of that\r\ncircumscribed territory that they must seek an explanation of what had\r\nso strangely transpired.\r\n\r\nIt was on the last day of January that the repairs of the schooner were\r\ncompleted. A slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which\r\nhad prevailed for the last few weeks, was the only apparent change in\r\nthe general order of things; but whether this was to be attributed to\r\nany alteration in the earth’s orbit was a question which would still\r\nrequire several days to decide. The weather remained fine, and although\r\na few clouds had accumulated, and might have caused a trifling fall\r\nof the barometer, they were not sufficiently threatening to delay the\r\ndeparture of the _Dobryna_.\r\n\r\nDoubts now arose, and some discussion followed, whether or not it was\r\ndesirable for Ben Zoof to accompany his master. There were various\r\nreasons why he should be left behind, not the least important being that\r\nthe schooner had no accommodation for horses, and the orderly would have\r\nfound it hard to part with Zephyr, and much more with his own favorite\r\nGalette; besides, it was advisable that there should be some one left to\r\nreceive any strangers that might possibly arrive, as well as to keep an\r\neye upon the herds of cattle which, in the dubious prospect before them,\r\nmight prove to be the sole resource of the survivors of the catastrophe.\r\nAltogether, taking into consideration that the brave fellow would incur\r\nno personal risk by remaining upon the island, the captain was induced\r\nwith much reluctance to forego the attendance of his servant, hoping\r\nvery shortly to return and to restore him to his country, when he had\r\nascertained the reason of the mysteries in which they were enveloped.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, then, Ben Zoof was “invested with governor’s powers,” and\r\ntook an affecting leave of his master, begging him, if chance should\r\ncarry him near Montmartre, to ascertain whether the beloved “mountain”\r\n had been left unmoved.\r\n\r\nFarewells over, the _Dobryna_ was carefully steered through the creek,\r\nand was soon upon the open sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. A SEARCH FOR ALGERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Dobryna_, a strong craft of 200 tons burden, had been built in the\r\nfamous shipbuilding yards in the Isle of Wight. Her sea going qualities\r\nwere excellent, and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of\r\nthe globe. Count Timascheff was himself no sailor, but had the\r\ngreatest confidence in leaving the command of his yacht in the hands of\r\nLieutenant Procope, a man of about thirty years of age, and an excellent\r\nseaman. Born on the count’s estates, the son of a serf who had been\r\nemancipated long before the famous edict of the Emperor Alexander,\r\nProcope was sincerely attached, by a tie of gratitude as well as of duty\r\nand affection, to his patron’s service. After an apprenticeship on a\r\nmerchant ship he had entered the imperial navy, and had already reached\r\nthe rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of\r\nhis own private yacht, in which he was accustomed to spend by far the\r\ngreater part of his time, throughout the winter generally cruising in\r\nthe Mediterranean, whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters.\r\n\r\nThe ship could not have been in better hands. The lieutenant was well\r\ninformed in many matters outside the pale of his profession, and his\r\nattainments were alike creditable to himself and to the liberal friend\r\nwho had given him his education. He had an excellent crew, consisting\r\nof Tiglew the engineer, four sailors named Niegoch, Tolstoy, Etkef, and\r\nPanofka, and Mochel the cook. These men, without exception, were all\r\nsons of the count’s tenants, and so tenaciously, even out at sea, did\r\nthey cling to their old traditions, that it mattered little to them what\r\nphysical disorganization ensued, so long as they felt they were sharing\r\nthe experiences of their lord and master. The late astounding events,\r\nhowever, had rendered Procope manifestly uneasy, and not the less\r\nso from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nSteam up and canvas spread, the schooner started eastwards. With a\r\nfavorable wind she would certainly have made eleven knots an hour\r\nhad not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress. Although only a\r\nmoderate breeze was blowing, the sea was rough, a circumstance to\r\nbe accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth’s\r\nattraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant, that by the mere\r\neffect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite\r\nunprecedented. M. Arago has fixed twenty-five or twenty-six feet as\r\nthe maximum elevation ever attained by the highest waves, and his\r\nastonishment would have been very great to see them rising fifty or\r\neven sixty feet. Nor did these waves in the usual way partially unfurl\r\nthemselves and rebound against the sides of the vessel; they might\r\nrather be described as long undulations carrying the schooner (its\r\nweight diminished from the same cause as that of the water) alternately\r\nto such heights and depths, that if Captain Servadac had been subject to\r\nseasickness he must have found himself in sorry plight. As the pitching,\r\nhowever, was the result of a long uniform swell, the yacht did not labor\r\nmuch harder than she would against the ordinary short strong waves of\r\nthe Mediterranean; the main inconvenience that was experienced was the\r\ndiminution in her proper rate of speed.\r\n\r\nFor a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by\r\nthe coast of Algeria; but no land appeared to the south. The changed\r\npositions of the planets rendered them of no avail for purposes of\r\nnautical observation, nor could Lieutenant Procope calculate his\r\nlatitude and longitude by the altitude of the sun, as his reckonings\r\nwould be useless when applied to charts that had been constructed for\r\nthe old order of things; but nevertheless, by means of the log, which\r\ngave him the rate of progress, and by the compass which indicated the\r\ndirection in which they were sailing, he was able to form an estimate\r\nof his position that was sufficiently free from error for his immediate\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nHappily the recent phenomena had no effect upon the compass; the\r\nmagnetic needle, which in these regions had pointed about 22 degrees\r\nfrom the north pole, had never deviated in the least--a proof that,\r\nalthough east and west had apparently changed places, north and south\r\ncontinued to retain their normal position as cardinal points. The log\r\nand the compass, therefore, were able to be called upon to do the work\r\nof the sextant, which had become utterly useless.\r\n\r\nOn the first morning of the cruise Lieutenant Procope, who, like most\r\nRussians, spoke French fluently, was explaining these peculiarities\r\nto Captain Servadac; the count was present, and the conversation\r\nperpetually recurred, as naturally it would, to the phenomena which\r\nremained so inexplicable to them all.\r\n\r\n“It is very evident,” said the lieutenant, “that ever since the 1st of\r\nJanuary the earth has been moving in a new orbit, and from some unknown\r\ncause has drawn nearer to the sun.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt about that,” said Servadac; “and I suppose that, having\r\ncrossed the orbit of Venus, we have a good chance of running into the\r\norbit of Mercury.”\r\n\r\n“And finish up by a collision with the sun!” added the count.\r\n\r\n“There is no fear of that, sir. The earth has undoubtedly entered upon\r\na new orbit, but she is not incurring any probable risk of being\r\nprecipitated onto the sun.”\r\n\r\n“Can you satisfy us of that?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n“I can, sir. I can give you a proof which I think you will own is\r\nconclusive. If, as you suppose, the earth is being drawn on so as to\r\nbe precipitated against the sun, the great center of attraction of our\r\nsystem, it could only be because the centrifugal and centripetal forces\r\nthat cause the planets to rotate in their several orbits had been\r\nentirely suspended: in that case, indeed, the earth would rush onwards\r\ntowards the sun, and in sixty-four days and a half the catastrophe you\r\ndread would inevitably happen.”\r\n\r\n“And what demonstration do you offer,” asked Servadac eagerly, “that it\r\nwill not happen?”\r\n\r\n“Simply this, captain: that since the earth entered her new orbit\r\nhalf the sixty-four days has already elapsed, and yet it is only just\r\nrecently that she has crossed the orbit of Venus, hardly one-third of\r\nthe distance to be traversed to reach the sun.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant paused to allow time for reflection, and added:\r\n“Moreover, I have every reason to believe that we are not so near the\r\nsun as we have been. The temperature has been gradually diminishing;\r\nthe heat upon Gourbi Island is not greater now than we might ordinarily\r\nexpect to find in Algeria. At the same time, we have the problem still\r\nunsolved that the Mediterranean has evidently been transported to the\r\nequatorial zone.”\r\n\r\nBoth the count and the captain expressed themselves reassured by his\r\nrepresentations, and observed that they must now do all in their power\r\nto discover what had become of the vast continent of Africa, of which,\r\nthey were hitherto failing so completely to find a vestige.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours after leaving the island, the _Dobryna_ had passed\r\nover the sites where Tenes, Cherchil, Koleah, and Sidi-Feruch once had\r\nbeen, but of these towns not one appeared within range of the telescope.\r\nOcean reigned supreme. Lieutenant Procope was absolutely certain that\r\nhe had not mistaken his direction; the compass showed that the wind\r\nhad never shifted from the west, and this, with the rate of speed as\r\nestimated by the log, combined to assure him that at this date, the 2d\r\nof February, the schooner was in lat. 36 degrees 49 min N. and long. 3\r\ndegrees 25 min E., the very spot which ought to have been occupied by\r\nthe Algerian capital. But Algiers, like all the other coast-towns, had\r\napparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac, with clenched teeth and knitted brow, stood sternly,\r\nalmost fiercely, regarding the boundless waste of water. His pulse beat\r\nfast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the\r\nlast few years in that vanished city. All the images of his past life\r\nfloated upon his memory; his thoughts sped away to his native France,\r\nonly to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal\r\nany traces of the Algerian metropolis.\r\n\r\n“Is it not impossible,” he murmured aloud, “that any city should\r\ndisappear so completely? Would not the loftiest eminences of the city\r\nat least be visible? Surely some portion of the Casbah must still rise\r\nabove the waves? The imperial fort, too, was built upon an elevation\r\nof 750 feet; it is incredible that it should be so totally submerged.\r\nUnless some vestiges of these are found, I shall begin to suspect that\r\nthe whole of Africa has been swallowed in some vast abyss.”\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance was most remarkable. Not a material object of any\r\nkind was to be noticed floating on the surface of the water; not one\r\nbranch of a tree had been seen drifting by, nor one spar belonging to\r\none of the numerous vessels that a month previously had been moored\r\nin the magnificent bay which stretched twelve miles across from Cape\r\nMatafuz to Point Pexade. Perhaps the depths might disclose what the\r\nsurface failed to reveal, and Count Timascheff, anxious that Servadac\r\nshould have every facility afforded him for solving his doubts, called\r\nfor the sounding-line. Forthwith, the lead was greased and lowered.\r\nTo the surprise of all, and especially of Lieutenant Procope, the\r\nline indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five\r\nfathoms; and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for\r\nmore than two hours over a considerable area, the differences of level\r\nwere insignificant, not corresponding in any degree to what would be\r\nexpected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats\r\nof an amphitheater. Astounding as it seemed, what alternative was left\r\nbut to suppose that the Algerian capital had been completely leveled by\r\nthe flood?\r\n\r\nThe sea-bottom was composed of neither rock, mud, sand, nor shells;\r\nthe sounding-lead brought up nothing but a kind of metallic dust, which\r\nglittered with a strange iridescence, and the nature of which it was\r\nimpossible to determine, as it was totally unlike what had ever been\r\nknown to be raised from the bed of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n“You must see, lieutenant, I should think, that we are not so near the\r\ncoast of Algeria as you imagined.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant shook his head. After pondering awhile, he said: “If\r\nwe were farther away I should expect to find a depth of two or three\r\nhundred fathoms instead of five fathoms. Five fathoms! I confess I am\r\npuzzled.”\r\n\r\nFor the next thirty-six hours, until the 4th of February, the sea was\r\nexamined and explored with the most unflagging perseverance. Its depth\r\nremained invariable, still four, or at most five, fathoms; and although\r\nits bottom was assiduously dredged, it was only to prove it barren of\r\nmarine production of any type.\r\n\r\nThe yacht made its way to lat. 36 degrees, and by reference to the\r\ncharts it was tolerably certain that she was cruising over the site of\r\nthe Sahel, the ridge that had separated the rich plain of the Mitidja\r\nfrom the sea, and of which the highest peak, Mount Boujereah, had\r\nreached an altitude of 1,200 feet; but even this peak, which might have\r\nbeen expected to emerge like an islet above the surface of the sea,\r\nwas nowhere to be traced. Nothing was to be done but to put about, and\r\nreturn in disappointment towards the north.\r\n\r\nThus the _Dobryna_ regained the waters of the Mediterranean without\r\ndiscovering a trace of the missing province of Algeria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. AN ISLAND TOMB\r\n\r\n\r\nNo longer, then, could there be any doubt as to the annihilation of\r\na considerable portion of the colony. Not merely had there been a\r\nsubmersion of the land, but the impression was more and more confirmed\r\nthat the very bowels of the earth must have yawned and closed again upon\r\na large territory. Of the rocky substratum of the province it became\r\nmore evident than ever that not a trace remained, and a new soil\r\nof unknown formation had certainly taken the place of the old sandy\r\nsea-bottom. As it altogether transcended the powers of those on board to\r\nelucidate the origin of this catastrophe, it was felt to be incumbent on\r\nthem at least to ascertain its extent.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and somewhat wavering discussion, it was at length decided\r\nthat the schooner should take advantage of the favorable wind and\r\nweather, and proceed at first towards the east, thus following the\r\noutline of what had formerly represented the coast of Africa, until that\r\ncoast had been lost in boundless sea.\r\n\r\nNot a vestige of it all remained; from Cape Matafuz to Tunis it had all\r\ngone, as though it had never been. The maritime town of Dellis, built\r\nlike Algiers, amphitheater-wise, had totally disappeared; the highest\r\npoints were quite invisible; not a trace on the horizon was left of the\r\nJurjura chain, the topmost point of which was known to have an altitude\r\nof more than 7,000 feet.\r\n\r\nUnsparing of her fuel, the _Dobryna_ made her way at full steam towards\r\nCape Blanc. Neither Cape Negro nor Cape Serrat was to be seen. The town\r\nof Bizerta, once charming in its oriental beauty, had vanished utterly;\r\nits marabouts, or temple-tombs, shaded by magnificent palms that fringed\r\nthe gulf, which by reason of its narrow mouth had the semblance of a\r\nlake, all had disappeared, giving place to a vast waste of sea, the\r\ntransparent waves of which, as still demonstrated by the sounding-line,\r\nhad ever the same uniform and arid bottom.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day the schooner rounded the point where, five\r\nweeks previously, Cape Blanc had been so conspicuous an object, and she\r\nwas now stemming the waters of what once had been the Bay of Tunis. But\r\nbay there was none, and the town from which it had derived its name,\r\nwith the Arsenal, the Goletta, and the two peaks of Bou-Kournein, had\r\nall vanished from the view. Cape Bon, too, the most northern promontory\r\nof Africa and the point of the continent nearest to the island of\r\nSicily, had been included in the general devastation.\r\n\r\nBefore the occurrence of the recent prodigy, the bottom of the\r\nMediterranean just at this point had formed a sudden ridge across the\r\nStraits of Libya. The sides of the ridge had shelved to so great an\r\nextent that, while the depth of water on the summit had been little more\r\nthan eleven fathoms, that on either hand of the elevation was little\r\nshort of a hundred fathoms. A formation such as this plainly indicated\r\nthat at some remote epoch Cape Bon had been connected with Cape Furina,\r\nthe extremity of Sicily, in the same manner as Ceuta has doubtless been\r\nconnected with Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope was too well acquainted with the Mediterranean to\r\nbe unaware of this peculiarity, and would not lose the opportunity of\r\nascertaining whether the submarine ridge still existed, or whether the\r\nsea-bottom between Sicily and Africa had undergone any modification.\r\n\r\nBoth Timascheff and Servadac were much interested in watching the\r\noperations. At a sign from the lieutenant, a sailor who was stationed at\r\nthe foot of the fore-shrouds dropped the sounding-lead into the water,\r\nand in reply to Procope’s inquiries, reported--“Five fathoms and a flat\r\nbottom.”\r\n\r\nThe next aim was to determine the amount of depression on either side of\r\nthe ridge, and for this purpose the _Dobryna_ was shifted for a distance\r\nof half a mile both to the right and left, and the soundings taken\r\nat each station. “Five fathoms and a flat bottom,” was the unvaried\r\nannouncement after each operation. Not only, therefore, was it evident\r\nthat the submerged chain between Cape Bon and Cape Furina no longer\r\nexisted, but it was equally clear that the convulsion had caused a\r\ngeneral leveling of the sea-bottom, and that the soil, degenerated, as\r\nit has been said, into a metallic dust of unrecognized composition,\r\nbore no trace of the sponges, sea-anemones, star-fish, sea-nettles,\r\nhydrophytes, and shells with which the submarine rocks of the\r\nMediterranean had hitherto been prodigally clothed.\r\n\r\nThe _Dobryna_ now put about and resumed her explorations in a southerly\r\ndirection. It remained, however, as remarkable as ever how completely\r\nthroughout the voyage the sea continued to be deserted; all expectations\r\nof hailing a vessel bearing news from Europe were entirely falsified, so\r\nthat more and more each member of the crew began to be conscious of his\r\nisolation, and to believe that the schooner, like a second Noah’s ark,\r\ncarried the sole survivors of a calamity that had overwhelmed the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of February the _Dobryna_ passed over the site of the city\r\nof Dido, the ancient Byrsa--a Carthage, however, which was now more\r\ncompletely destroyed than ever Punic Carthage had been destroyed by\r\nScipio Africanus or Roman Carthage by Hassan the Saracen.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as the sun was sinking below the eastern horizon,\r\nCaptain Servadac was lounging moodily against the taffrail. From the\r\nheaven above, where stars kept peeping fitfully from behind the moving\r\nclouds, his eye wandered mechanically to the waters below, where the\r\nlong waves were rising and falling with the evening breeze.\r\n\r\nAll at once, his attention was arrested by a luminous speck straight\r\nahead on the southern horizon. At first, imagining that he was the\r\nvictim of some spectral illusion, he observed it with silent attention;\r\nbut when, after some minutes, he became convinced that what he saw was\r\nactually a distant light, he appealed to one of the sailors, by whom\r\nhis impression was fully corroborated. The intelligence was immediately\r\nimparted to Count Timascheff and the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“Is it land, do you suppose?” inquired Servadac, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“I should be more inclined to think it is a light on board some ship,”\r\n replied the count.\r\n\r\n“Whatever it is, in another hour we shall know all about it,” said\r\nServadac.\r\n\r\n“No, captain,” interposed Lieutenant Procope; “we shall know nothing\r\nuntil to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“What! not bear down upon it at once?” asked the count in surprise.\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I should much rather lay to and wait till daylight. If we are\r\nreally near land, I should be afraid to approach it in the dark.”\r\n\r\nThe count expressed his approval of the lieutenant’s caution, and\r\nthereupon all sail was shortened so as to keep the _Dobryna_ from making\r\nany considerable progress all through the hours of night. Few as those\r\nhours were, they seemed to those on board as if their end would never\r\ncome. Fearful lest the faint glimmer should at any moment cease to be\r\nvisible, Hector Servadac did not quit his post upon the deck; but the\r\nlight continued unchanged. It shone with about the same degree of luster\r\nas a star of the second magnitude, and from the fact of its remaining\r\nstationary, Procope became more and more convinced that it was on land\r\nand did not belong to a passing vessel.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise every telescope was pointed with keenest interest towards the\r\ncenter of attraction. The light, of course, had ceased to be visible,\r\nbut in the direction where it had been seen, and at a distance of about\r\nten miles, there was the distinct outline of a solitary island of very\r\nsmall extent; rather, as the count observed, it had the appearance of\r\nbeing the projecting summit of a mountain all but submerged. Whatever it\r\nwas, it was agreed that its true character must be ascertained, not\r\nonly to gratify their own curiosity, but for the benefit of all future\r\nnavigators. The schooner accordingly was steered directly towards it,\r\nand in less than an hour had cast anchor within a few cables’ lengths of\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nThe little island proved to be nothing more than an arid rock rising\r\nabruptly about forty feet above the water. It had no outlying reefs, a\r\ncircumstance that seemed to suggest the probability that in the recent\r\nconvulsion it had sunk gradually, until it had reached its present\r\nposition of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nWithout removing his eye from his telescope, Servadac exclaimed: “There\r\nis a habitation on the place; I can see an erection of some kind quite\r\ndistinctly. Who can tell whether we shall not come across a human\r\nbeing?”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope looked doubtful. The island had all the appearance of\r\nbeing deserted, nor did a cannon-shot fired from the schooner have\r\nthe effect of bringing any resident to the shore. Nevertheless, it was\r\nundeniable that there was a stone building situated on the top of\r\nthe rock, and that this building had much the character of an Arabian\r\nmosque.\r\n\r\nThe boat was lowered and manned by the four sailors; Servadac,\r\nTimascheff and Procope were quickly rowed ashore, and lost no time\r\nin commencing their ascent of the steep acclivity. Upon reaching the\r\nsummit, they found their progress arrested by a kind of wall, or rampart\r\nof singular construction, its materials consisting mainly of vases,\r\nfragments of columns, carved bas-reliefs, statues, and portions of\r\nbroken stelae, all piled promiscuously together without any pretense\r\nto artistic arrangement. They made their way into the enclosure, and\r\nfinding an open door, they passed through and soon came to a second\r\ndoor, also open, which admitted them to the interior of the mosque,\r\nconsisting of a single chamber, the walls of which were ornamented in\r\nthe Arabian style by sculptures of indifferent execution. In the center\r\nwas a tomb of the very simplest kind, and above the tomb was suspended a\r\nlarge silver lamp with a capacious reservoir of oil, in which floated a\r\nlong lighted wick, the flame of which was evidently the light that had\r\nattracted Servadac’s attention on the previous night.\r\n\r\n“Must there not have been a custodian of the shrine?” they mutually\r\nasked; but if such there had ever been, he must, they concluded, either\r\nhave fled or have perished on that eventful night. Not a soul was there\r\nin charge, and the sole living occupants were a flock of wild cormorants\r\nwhich, startled at the entrance of the intruders, rose on wing, and took\r\na rapid flight towards the south.\r\n\r\nAn old French prayer-book was lying on the corner of the tomb; the\r\nvolume was open, and the page exposed to view was that which contained\r\nthe office for the celebration of the 25th of August. A sudden\r\nrevelation dashed across Servadac’s mind. The solemn isolation of the\r\nisland tomb, the open breviary, the ritual of the ancient anniversary,\r\nall combined to apprise him of the sanctity of the spot upon which he\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n“The tomb of St. Louis!” he exclaimed, and his companions involuntarily\r\nfollowed his example, and made a reverential obeisance to the venerated\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nIt was, in truth, the very spot on which tradition asserts that the\r\ncanonized monarch came to die, a spot to which for six centuries and\r\nmore his countrymen had paid the homage of a pious regard. The lamp\r\nthat had been kindled at the memorial shrine of a saint was now in all\r\nprobability the only beacon that threw a light across the waters of the\r\nMediterranean, and even this ere long must itself expire.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to explore. The three together quitted the\r\nmosque, and descended the rock to the shore, whence their boat\r\nre-conveyed them to the schooner, which was soon again on her southward\r\nvoyage; and it was not long before the tomb of St. Louis, the only spot\r\nthat had survived the mysterious shock, was lost to view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. AT THE MERCY OF THE WINDS\r\n\r\nAs the affrighted cormorants had winged their flight towards the south,\r\nthere sprang up a sanguine hope on board the schooner that land might be\r\ndiscovered in that direction. Thither, accordingly, it was determined to\r\nproceed, and in a few hours after quitting the island of the tomb,\r\nthe _Dobryna_ was traversing the shallow waters that now covered the\r\npeninsula of Dakhul, which had separated the Bay of Tunis from the Gulf\r\nof Hammamet. For two days she continued an undeviating course, and\r\nafter a futile search for the coast of Tunis, reached the latitude of 34\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nHere, on the 11th of February, there suddenly arose the cry of “Land!”\r\n and in the extreme horizon, right ahead, where land had never been\r\nbefore, it was true enough that a shore was distinctly to be seen. What\r\ncould it be? It could not be the coast of Tripoli; for not only would\r\nthat low-lying shore be quite invisible at such a distance, but it was\r\ncertain, moreover, that it lay two degrees at least still further\r\nsouth. It was soon observed that this newly discovered land was of\r\nvery irregular elevation, that it extended due east and west across\r\nthe horizon, thus dividing the gulf into two separate sections and\r\ncompletely concealing the island of Jerba, which must lie behind. Its\r\nposition was duly traced on the _Dobryna_‘s chart.\r\n\r\n“How strange,” exclaimed Hector Servadac, “that after sailing all this\r\ntime over sea where we expected to find land, we have at last come upon\r\nland where we thought to find sea!”\r\n\r\n“Strange, indeed,” replied Lieutenant Procope; “and what appears to me\r\nalmost as remarkable is that we have never once caught sight either of\r\none of the Maltese tartans or one of the Levantine xebecs that traffic\r\nso regularly on the Mediterranean.”\r\n\r\n“Eastwards or westwards,” asked the count--“which shall be our course?\r\nAll farther progress to the south is checked.”\r\n\r\n“Westwards, by all means,” replied Servadac quickly. “I am longing to\r\nknow whether anything of Algeria is left beyond the Shelif; besides,\r\nas we pass Gourbi Island we might take Ben Zoof on board, and then\r\nmake away for Gibraltar, where we should be sure to learn something, at\r\nleast, of European news.”\r\n\r\nWith his usual air of stately courtesy, Count Timascheff begged the\r\ncaptain to consider the yacht at his own disposal, and desired him to\r\ngive the lieutenant instructions accordingly.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope, however, hesitated, and after revolving matters\r\nfor a few moments in his mind, pointed out that as the wind was blowing\r\ndirectly from the west, and seemed likely to increase, if they went to\r\nthe west in the teeth of the weather, the schooner would be reduced to\r\nthe use of her engine only, and would have much difficulty in making any\r\nheadway; on the other hand, by taking an eastward course, not only would\r\nthey have the advantage of the wind, but, under steam and canvas, might\r\nhope in a few days to be off the coast of Egypt, and from Alexandria or\r\nsome other port they would have the same opportunity of getting tidings\r\nfrom Europe as they would at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nIntensely anxious as he was to revisit the province of Oran, and\r\neager, too, to satisfy himself of the welfare of his faithful Ben\r\nZoof, Servadac could not but own the reasonableness of the lieutenant’s\r\nobjections, and yielded to the proposal that the eastward course should\r\nbe adopted. The wind gave signs only too threatening of the breeze\r\nrising to a gale; but, fortunately, the waves did not culminate in\r\nbreakers, but rather in a long swell which ran in the same direction as\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fortnight the high temperature had been gradually\r\ndiminishing, until it now reached an average of 20 degrees Cent. (or 68\r\ndegrees Fahr.), and sometimes descended as low as 15 degrees. That this\r\ndiminution was to be attributed to the change in the earth’s orbit was a\r\nquestion that admitted of little doubt. After approaching so near to the\r\nsun as to cross the orbit of Venus, the earth must now have receded\r\nso far from the sun that its normal distance of ninety-one millions of\r\nmiles was greatly increased, and the probability was great that it was\r\napproximating to the orbit of Mars, that planet which in its physical\r\nconstitution most nearly resembles our own. Nor was this supposition\r\nsuggested merely by the lowering of the temperature; it was strongly\r\ncorroborated by the reduction of the apparent diameter of the sun’s disc\r\nto the precise dimensions which it would assume to an observer actually\r\nstationed on the surface of Mars. The necessary inference that seemed to\r\nfollow from these phenomena was that the earth had been projected into a\r\nnew orbit, which had the form of a very elongated ellipse.\r\n\r\nVery slight, however, in comparison was the regard which these\r\nastronomical wonders attracted on board the _Dobryna_. All interest\r\nthere was too much absorbed in terrestrial matters, and in ascertaining\r\nwhat changes had taken place in the configuration of the earth itself,\r\nto permit much attention to be paid to its erratic movements through\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe schooner kept bravely on her way, but well out to sea, at a distance\r\nof two miles from land. There was good need of this precaution, for so\r\nprecipitous was the shore that a vessel driven upon it must inevitably\r\nhave gone to pieces; it did not offer a single harbor of refuge, but,\r\nsmooth and perpendicular as the walls of a fortress, it rose to a height\r\nof two hundred, and occasionally of three hundred feet. The waves dashed\r\nviolently against its base. Upon the general substratum rested a massive\r\nconglomerate, the crystallizations of which rose like a forest of\r\ngigantic pyramids and obelisks.\r\n\r\nBut what struck the explorers more than anything was the appearance of\r\nsingular newness that pervaded the whole of the region. It all seemed\r\nso recent in its formation that the atmosphere had had no opportunity of\r\nproducing its wonted effect in softening the hardness of its lines, in\r\nrounding the sharpness of its angles, or in modifying the color of\r\nits surface; its outline was clearly marked against the sky, and its\r\nsubstance, smooth and polished as though fresh from a founder’s mold,\r\nglittered with the metallic brilliancy that is characteristic of\r\npyrites. It seemed impossible to come to any other conclusion but\r\nthat the land before them, continent or island, had been upheaved by\r\nsubterranean forces above the surface of the sea, and that it was mainly\r\ncomposed of the same metallic element as had characterized the dust so\r\nfrequently uplifted from the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe extreme nakedness of the entire tract was likewise very\r\nextraordinary. Elsewhere, in various quarters of the globe, there may\r\nbe sterile rocks, but there are none so adamant as to be altogether\r\nunfurrowed by the filaments engendered in the moist residuum of the\r\ncondensed vapor; elsewhere there may be barren steeps, but none so rigid\r\nas not to afford some hold to vegetation, however low and elementary\r\nmay be its type; but here all was bare, and blank, and desolate--not a\r\nsymptom of vitality was visible.\r\n\r\nSuch being the condition of the adjacent land, it could hardly be a\r\nmatter of surprise that all the sea-birds, the albatross, the gull, the\r\nsea-mew, sought continual refuge on the schooner; day and night they\r\nperched fearlessly upon the yards, the report of a gun failing to\r\ndislodge them, and when food of any sort was thrown upon the deck,\r\nthey would dart down and fight with eager voracity for the prize. Their\r\nextreme avidity was recognized as a proof that any land where they could\r\nobtain a sustenance must be far remote.\r\n\r\nOnwards thus for several days the _Dobryna_ followed the contour of the\r\ninhospitable coast, of which the features would occasionally change,\r\nsometimes for two or three miles assuming the form of a simple arris,\r\nsharply defined as though cut by a chisel, when suddenly the prismatic\r\nlamellae soaring in rugged confusion would again recur; but all along\r\nthere was the same absence of beach or tract of sand to mark its base,\r\nneither were there any of those shoals of rock that are ordinarily found\r\nin shallow water. At rare intervals there were some narrow fissures,\r\nbut not a creek available for a ship to enter to replenish its supply of\r\nwater; and the wide roadsteads were unprotected and exposed to well-nigh\r\nevery point of the compass.\r\n\r\nBut after sailing two hundred and forty miles, the progress of the\r\n_Dobryna_ was suddenly arrested. Lieutenant Procope, who had sedulously\r\ninserted the outline of the newly revealed shore upon the maps,\r\nannounced that it had ceased to run east and west, and had taken a turn\r\ndue north, thus forming a barrier to their continuing their previous\r\ndirection. It was, of course, impossible to conjecture how far this\r\nbarrier extended; it coincided pretty nearly with the fourteenth\r\nmeridian of east longitude; and if it reached, as probably it did,\r\nbeyond Sicily to Italy, it was certain that the vast basin of the\r\nMediterranean, which had washed the shores alike of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica, must have been reduced to about half its original area.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to proceed upon the same plan as heretofore, following\r\nthe boundary of the land at a safe distance. Accordingly, the head of\r\nthe _Dobryna_ was pointed north, making straight, as it was presumed,\r\nfor the south of Europe. A hundred miles, or somewhat over, in that\r\ndirection, and it was to be anticipated she would come in sight of\r\nMalta, if only that ancient island, the heritage in succession of\r\nPhoenicians, Carthaginians, Sicilians, Romans, Vandals, Greeks,\r\nArabians, and the knights of Rhodes, should still be undestroyed.\r\n\r\nBut Malta, too, was gone; and when, upon the 14th, the sounding-line was\r\ndropped upon its site, it was only with the same result so oftentimes\r\nobtained before.\r\n\r\n“The devastation is not limited to Africa,” observed the count.\r\n\r\n“Assuredly not,” assented the lieutenant; adding, “and I confess I am\r\nalmost in despair whether we shall ever ascertain its limits. To what\r\nquarter of Europe, if Europe still exists, do you propose that I should\r\nnow direct your course?”\r\n\r\n“To Sicily, Italy, France!” ejaculated Servadac, eagerly,--“anywhere\r\nwhere we can learn the truth of what has befallen us.”\r\n\r\n“How if we are the sole survivors?” said the count, gravely.\r\n\r\nHector Servadac was silent; his own secret presentiment so thoroughly\r\ncoincided with the doubts expressed by the count, that he refrained from\r\nsaying another word.\r\n\r\nThe coast, without deviation, still tended towards the north. No\r\nalternative, therefore, remained than to take a westerly course and to\r\nattempt to reach the northern shores of the Mediterranean. On the 16th\r\nthe _Dobryna_ essayed to start upon her altered way, but it seemed as if\r\nthe elements had conspired to obstruct her progress. A furious tempest\r\narose; the wind beat dead in the direction of the coast, and the danger\r\nincurred by a vessel of a tonnage so light was necessarily very great.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope was extremely uneasy. He took in all sail, struck\r\nhis topmasts, and resolved to rely entirely on his engine. But the peril\r\nseemed only to increase. Enormous waves caught the schooner and carried\r\nher up to their crests, whence again she was plunged deep into the\r\nabysses that they left. The screw failed to keep its hold upon the\r\nwater, but continually revolved with useless speed in the vacant air;\r\nand thus, although the steam was forced on to the extremest limit\r\nconsistent with safety, the vessel held her way with the utmost\r\ndifficulty, and recoiled before the hurricane.\r\n\r\nStill, not a single resort for refuge did the inaccessible shore\r\npresent. Again and again the lieutenant asked himself what would become\r\nof him and his comrades, even if they should survive the peril of\r\nshipwreck, and gain a footing upon the cliff. What resources could\r\nthey expect to find upon that scene of desolation? What hope could they\r\nentertain that any portion of the old continent still existed beyond\r\nthat dreary barrier?\r\n\r\nIt was a trying time, but throughout it all the crew behaved with\r\nthe greatest courage and composure; confident in the skill of their\r\ncommander, and in the stability of their ship, they performed their\r\nduties with steadiness and unquestioning obedience.\r\n\r\nBut neither skill, nor courage, nor obedience could avail; all was in\r\nvain. Despite the strain put upon her engine, the schooner, bare of\r\ncanvas (for not even the smallest stay-sail could have withstood the\r\nviolence of the storm), was drifting with terrific speed towards the\r\nmenacing precipices, which were only a. few short miles to leeward.\r\nFully alive to the hopelessness of their situation, the crew were all on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\n“All over with us, sir!” said Procope to the count. “I have done\r\neverything that man could do; but our case is desperate. Nothing short\r\nof a miracle can save us now. Within an hour we must go to pieces upon\r\nyonder rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Let us, then, commend ourselves to the providence of Him to Whom\r\nnothing is impossible,” replied the count, in a calm, clear voice\r\nthat could be distinctly heard by all; and as he spoke, he reverently\r\nuncovered, an example in which he was followed by all the rest.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the vessel seeming thus inevitable, Lieutenant\r\nProcope took the best measures he could to insure a few days’ supply\r\nof food for any who might escape ashore. He ordered several cases of\r\nprovisions and kegs of water to be brought on deck, and saw that they\r\nwere securely lashed to some empty barrels, to make them float after the\r\nship had gone down.\r\n\r\nLess and less grew the distance from the shore, but no creek, no inlet,\r\ncould be discerned in the towering wall of cliff, which seemed about to\r\ntopple over and involve them in annihilation. Except a change of wind\r\nor, as Procope observed, a supernatural rifting of the rock, nothing\r\ncould bring deliverance now. But the wind did not veer, and in a few\r\nminutes more the schooner was hardly three cables’ distance from the\r\nfatal land. All were aware that their last moment had arrived. Servadac\r\nand the count grasped each other’s hands for a long farewell; and,\r\ntossed by the tremendous waves, the schooner was on the very point of\r\nbeing hurled upon the cliff, when a ringing shout was heard. “Quick,\r\nboys, quick! Hoist the jib, and right the tiller!”\r\n\r\nSudden and startling as the unexpected orders were, they were executed\r\nas if by magic.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant, who had shouted from the bow, rushed astern and took\r\nthe helm, and before anyone had time to speculate upon the object of his\r\nmaneuvers, he shouted again, “Look out! sharp! watch the sheets!”\r\n\r\nAn involuntary cry broke forth from all on board. But it was no cry\r\nof terror. Right ahead was a narrow opening in the solid rock; it was\r\nhardly forty feet wide. Whether it was a passage or no, it mattered\r\nlittle; it was at least a refuge; and, driven by wind and wave, the\r\n_Dobryna_, under the dexterous guidance of the lieutenant, dashed in\r\nbetween its perpendicular walls.\r\n\r\nHad she not immured herself in a perpetual prison?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. A ROYAL SALUTE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Then I take your bishop, major,” said Colonel Murphy, as he made a move\r\nthat he had taken since the previous evening to consider.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid you would,” replied Major Oliphant, looking intently at\r\nthe chess-board.\r\n\r\nSuch was the way in which a long silence was broken on the morning of\r\nthe 17th of February by the old calendar.\r\n\r\nAnother day elapsed before another move was made. It was a protracted\r\ngame; it had, in fact, already lasted some months--the players being\r\nso deliberate, and so fearful of taking a step without the most mature\r\nconsideration, that even now they were only making the twentieth move.\r\n\r\nBoth of them, moreover, were rigid disciples of the renowned Philidor,\r\nwho pronounces that to play the pawns well is “the soul of chess”; and,\r\naccordingly, not one pawn had been sacrificed without a most vigorous\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThe men who were thus beguiling their leisure were two officers in the\r\nBritish army--Colonel Heneage Finch Murphy and Major Sir John Temple\r\nOliphant. Remarkably similar in personal appearance, they were hardly\r\nless so in personal character. Both of them were about forty years of\r\nage; both of them were tall and fair, with bushy whiskers and mustaches;\r\nboth of them were phlegmatic in temperament, and both much addicted to\r\nthe wearing of their uniforms. They were proud of their nationality,\r\nand exhibited a manifest dislike, verging upon contempt, of everything\r\nforeign. Probably they would have felt no surprise if they had been\r\ntold that Anglo-Saxons were fashioned out of some specific clay, the\r\nproperties of which surpassed the investigation of chemical analysis.\r\nWithout any intentional disparagement they might, in a certain way,\r\nbe compared to two scarecrows which, though perfectly harmless in\r\nthemselves, inspire some measure of respect, and are excellently adapted\r\nto protect the territory intrusted to their guardianship.\r\n\r\nEnglish-like, the two officers had made themselves thoroughly at home in\r\nthe station abroad in which it had been their lot to be quartered. The\r\nfaculty of colonization seems to be indigenous to the native character;\r\nonce let an Englishman plant his national standard on the surface of the\r\nmoon, and it would not be long before a colony was established round it.\r\n\r\nThe officers had a servant, named Kirke, and a company of ten soldiers\r\nof the line. This party of thirteen men were apparently the sole\r\nsurvivors of an overwhelming catastrophe, which on the 1st of January\r\nhad transformed an enormous rock, garrisoned with well-nigh two thousand\r\ntroops, into an insignificant island far out to sea. But although the\r\ntransformation had been so marvelous, it cannot be said that either\r\nColonel Murphy or Major Oliphant had made much demonstration of\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“This is all very peculiar, Sir John,” observed the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Yes, colonel; very peculiar,” replied the major.\r\n\r\n“England will be sure to send for us,” said one officer.\r\n\r\n“No doubt she will,” answered the other.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they came to the mutual resolution that they would “stick\r\nto their post.”\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, it would have been a difficult matter for the gallant\r\nofficers to do otherwise; they had but one small boat; therefore, it was\r\nwell that they made a virtue of necessity, and resigned themselves to\r\npatient expectation of the British ship which, in due time, would bring\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThey had no fear of starvation. Their island was mined with\r\nsubterranean stores, more than ample for thirteen men--nay, for thirteen\r\nEnglishmen--for the next five years at least. Preserved meat, ale,\r\nbrandy--all were in abundance; consequently, as the men expressed it,\r\nthey were in this respect “all right.”\r\n\r\nOf course, the physical changes that had taken place had attracted the\r\nnotice both of officers and men. But the reversed position of east and\r\nwest, the diminution of the force of gravity, the altered rotation of\r\nthe earth, and her projection upon a new orbit, were all things that\r\ngave them little concern and no uneasiness; and when the colonel and the\r\nmajor had replaced the pieces on the board which had been disturbed\r\nby the convulsion, any surprise they might have felt at the chess-men\r\nlosing some portion of their weight was quite forgotten in the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing them retain their equilibrium.\r\n\r\nOne phenomenon, however, did not fail to make its due impression upon\r\nthe men; this was the diminution in the length of day and night. Three\r\ndays after the catastrophe, Corporal Pim, on behalf of himself and his\r\ncomrades, solicited a formal interview with the officers. The request\r\nhaving been granted, Pim, with the nine soldiers, all punctiliously\r\nwearing the regimental tunic of scarlet and trousers of invisible green,\r\npresented themselves at the door of the colonel’s room, where he and\r\nhis brother-officer were continuing their game. Raising his hand\r\nrespectfully to his cap, which he wore poised jauntily over his right\r\near, and scarcely held on by the strap below his under lip, the corporal\r\nwaited permission to speak.\r\n\r\nAfter a lingering survey of the chess-board, the colonel slowly lifted\r\nhis eyes, and said with official dignity, “Well, men, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“First of all, sir,” replied the corporal, “we want to speak to you\r\nabout our pay, and then we wish to have a word with the major about our\r\nrations.”\r\n\r\n“Say on, then,” said Colonel Murphy. “What is it about your pay?”\r\n\r\n“Just this, sir; as the days are only half as long as they were, we\r\nshould like to know whether our pay is to be diminished in proportion.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel was taken somewhat aback, and did not reply immediately,\r\nthough by some significant nods towards the major, he indicated that he\r\nthought the question very reasonable. After a few moments’ reflection,\r\nhe replied, “It must, I think, be allowed that your pay was calculated\r\nfrom sunrise to sunrise; there was no specification of what the interval\r\nshould be. Your pay will continue as before. England can afford it.”\r\n\r\nA buzz of approval burst involuntarily from all the men, but military\r\ndiscipline and the respect due to their officers kept them in check from\r\nany boisterous demonstration of their satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“And now, corporal, what is your business with me?” asked Major\r\nOliphant.\r\n\r\n“We want to know whether, as the days are only six hours long, we are to\r\nhave but two meals instead of four?”\r\n\r\nThe officers looked at each other, and by their glances agreed that the\r\ncorporal was a man of sound common sense.\r\n\r\n“Eccentricities of nature,” said the major, “cannot interfere with\r\nmilitary regulations. It is true that there will be but an interval of\r\nan hour and a half between them, but the rule stands good--four meals\r\na day. England is too rich to grudge her soldiers any of her soldiers’\r\ndue. Yes; four meals a day.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” shouted the soldiers, unable this time to keep their delight\r\nwithin the bounds of military decorum; and, turning to the right-about,\r\nthey marched away, leaving the officers to renew the all-absorbing game.\r\n\r\nHowever confident everyone upon the island might profess to be that\r\nsuccor would be sent them from their native land--for Britain never\r\nabandons any of her sons--it could not be disguised that that succor\r\nwas somewhat tardy in making its appearance. Many and various were the\r\nconjectures to account for the delay. Perhaps England was engrossed\r\nwith domestic matters, or perhaps she was absorbed in diplomatic\r\ndifficulties; or perchance, more likely than all, Northern Europe had\r\nreceived no tidings of the convulsion that had shattered the south. The\r\nwhole party throve remarkably well upon the liberal provisions of the\r\ncommissariat department, and if the officers failed to show the same\r\ntendency to _embonpoint_ which was fast becoming characteristic of the\r\nmen, it was only because they deemed it due to their rank to curtail any\r\nindulgences which might compromise the fit of their uniform.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, time passed indifferently well. An Englishman rarely\r\nsuffers from _ennui_, and then only in his own country, when required to\r\nconform to what he calls “the humbug of society”; and the two officers,\r\nwith their similar tastes, ideas, and dispositions, got on together\r\nadmirably. It is not to be questioned that they were deeply affected by\r\na sense of regret for their lost comrades, and astounded beyond measure\r\nat finding themselves the sole survivors of a garrison of 1,895 men,\r\nbut with true British pluck and self-control, they had done nothing\r\nmore than draw up a report that 1,882 names were missing from the\r\nmuster-roll.\r\n\r\nThe island itself, the sole surviving fragment of an enormous pile of\r\nrock that had reared itself some 1,600 feet above the sea, was not,\r\nstrictly speaking, the only land that was visible; for about twelve\r\nmiles to the south there was another island, apparently the very\r\ncounterpart of what was now occupied by the Englishmen. It was\r\nonly natural that this should awaken some interest even in the most\r\nimperturbable minds, and there was no doubt that the two officers,\r\nduring one of the rare intervals when they were not absorbed in their\r\ngame, had decided that it would be desirable at least to ascertain\r\nwhether the island was deserted, or whether it might not be occupied by\r\nsome others, like themselves, survivors from the general catastrophe.\r\nCertain it is that one morning, when the weather was bright and calm,\r\nthey had embarked alone in the little boat, and been absent for seven or\r\neight hours. Not even to Corporal Pim did they communicate the object\r\nof their excursion, nor say one syllable as to its result, and it could\r\nonly be inferred from their manner that they were quite satisfied with\r\nwhat they had seen; and very shortly afterwards Major Oliphant was\r\nobserved to draw up a lengthy document, which was no sooner finished\r\nthan it was formally signed and sealed with the seal of the 33rd\r\nRegiment. It was directed:\r\n\r\n _To the First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\n  London,_\r\n\r\nand kept in readiness for transmission by the first ship that should\r\nhail in sight. But time elapsed, and here was the 18th of February\r\nwithout an opportunity having been afforded for any communication with\r\nthe British Government.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast that morning, the colonel observed to the major that he was\r\nunder the most decided impression that the 18th of February was a royal\r\nanniversary; and he went on to say that, although he had received no\r\ndefinite instructions on the subject, he did not think that the peculiar\r\ncircumstances under which they found themselves should prevent them from\r\ngiving the day its due military honors.\r\n\r\nThe major quite concurred; and it was mutually agreed that the occasion\r\nmust be honored by a bumper of port, and by a royal salute. Corporal Pim\r\nmust be sent for. The corporal soon made his appearance, smacking his\r\nlips, having, by a ready intuition, found a pretext for a double morning\r\nration of spirits.\r\n\r\n“The 18th of February, you know, Pim,” said the colonel; “we must have a\r\nsalute of twenty-one guns.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” replied Pim, a man of few words.\r\n\r\n“And take care that your fellows don’t get their arms and legs blown\r\noff,” added the officer.\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” said the corporal; and he made his salute and\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nOf all the bombs, howitzers, and various species of artillery with which\r\nthe fortress had been crowded, one solitary piece remained. This was a\r\ncumbrous muzzle-loader of 9-inch caliber, and, in default of the smaller\r\nordnance generally employed for the purpose, had to be brought into\r\nrequisition for the royal salute.\r\n\r\nA sufficient number of charges having been provided, the corporal\r\nbrought his men to the reduct, whence the gun’s mouth projected over\r\na sloping embrasure. The two officers, in cocked hats and full staff\r\nuniform, attended to take charge of the proceedings. The gun was\r\nmaneuvered in strict accordance with the rules of “The Artilleryman’s\r\nManual,” and the firing commenced.\r\n\r\nNot unmindful of the warning he had received, the corporal was most\r\ncareful between each discharge to see that every vestige of fire was\r\nextinguished, so as to prevent an untimely explosion while the men were\r\nreloading; and accidents, such as so frequently mar public rejoicings,\r\nwere all happily avoided.\r\n\r\nMuch to the chagrin of both Colonel Murphy and Major Oliphant, the\r\neffect of the salute fell altogether short of their anticipations. The\r\nweight of the atmosphere was so reduced that there was comparatively\r\nlittle resistance to the explosive force of the gases, liberated at the\r\ncannon’s mouth, and there was consequently none of the reverberation,\r\nlike rolling thunder, that ordinarily follows the discharge of heavy\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nTwenty times had the gun been fired, and it was on the point of being\r\nloaded for the last time, when the colonel laid his hand upon the arm of\r\nthe man who had the ramrod. “Stop!” he said; “we will have a ball this\r\ntime. Let us put the range of the piece to the test.”\r\n\r\n“A good idea!” replied the major. “Corporal, you hear the orders.”\r\n\r\nIn quick time an artillery-wagon was on the spot, and the men lifted\r\nout a full-sized shot, weighing 200 lbs., which, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, the cannon would carry about four miles. It was proposed,\r\nby means of telescopes, to note the place where the ball first touched\r\nthe water, and thus to obtain an approximation sufficiently accurate as\r\nto the true range.\r\n\r\nHaving been duly charged with powder and ball, the gun was raised to an\r\nangle of something under 45 degrees, so as to allow proper development\r\nto the curve that the projectile would make, and, at a signal from the\r\nmajor, the light was applied to the priming.\r\n\r\n“Heavens!” “By all that’s good!” exclaimed both officers in one breath,\r\nas, standing open-mouthed, they hardly knew whether they were to believe\r\nthe evidence of their own senses. “Is it possible?”\r\n\r\nThe diminution of the force of attraction at the earth’s surface was so\r\nconsiderable that the ball had sped beyond the horizon.\r\n\r\n“Incredible!” ejaculated the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Incredible!” echoed the major.\r\n\r\n“Six miles at least!” observed the one.\r\n\r\n“Ay, more than that!” replied the other.\r\n\r\nAwhile, they gazed at the sea and at each other in mute amazement. But\r\nin the midst of their perplexity, what sound was that which startled\r\nthem? Was it mere fancy? Was it the reverberation of the cannon still\r\nbooming in their ears? Or was it not truly the report of another and\r\na distant gun in answer to their own? Attentively and eagerly they\r\nlistened. Twice, thrice did the sound repeat itself. It was quite\r\ndistinct. There could be no mistake.\r\n\r\n“I told you so,” cried the colonel, triumphantly. “I knew our country\r\nwould not forsake us; it is an English ship, no doubt.”\r\n\r\nIn half an hour two masts were visible above the horizon. “See! Was\r\nI not right? Our country was sure to send to our relief. Here is the\r\nship.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the major; “she responded to our gun.”\r\n\r\n“It is to be hoped,” muttered the corporal, “that our ball has done her\r\nno damage.”\r\n\r\nBefore long the hull was full in sight. A long trail of smoke betokened\r\nher to be a steamer; and very soon, by the aid of the glass, it could be\r\nascertained that she was a schooner-yacht, and making straight for the\r\nisland. A flag at her mast-head fluttered in the breeze, and towards\r\nthis the two officers, with the keenest attention, respectively adjusted\r\ntheir focus.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously the two telescopes were lowered. The colonel and the\r\nmajor stared at each other in blank astonishment. “Russian!” they\r\ngasped.\r\n\r\nAnd true it was that the flag that floated at the head of yonder mast\r\nwas the blue cross of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. SENSITIVE NATIONALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the schooner had approached the island, the Englishmen were able\r\nto make out the name “_Dobryna_” painted on the aft-board. A sinuous\r\nirregularity of the coast had formed a kind of cove, which, though\r\nhardly spacious enough for a few fishing-smacks, would afford the yacht\r\na temporary anchorage, so long as the wind did not blow violently from\r\neither west or south. Into this cove the _Dobryna_ was duly signaled,\r\nand as soon as she was safely moored, she lowered her four-oar, and\r\nCount Timascheff and Captain Servadac made their way at once to land.\r\n\r\nColonel Heneage Finch Murphy and Major Sir John Temple Oliphant stood,\r\ngrave and prim, formally awaiting the arrival of their visitors. Captain\r\nServadac, with the uncontrolled vivacity natural to a Frenchman, was the\r\nfirst to speak.\r\n\r\n“A joyful sight, gentlemen!” he exclaimed. “It will give us unbounded\r\npleasure to shake hands again with some of our fellow-creatures. You, no\r\ndoubt, have escaped the same disaster as ourselves.”\r\n\r\nBut the English officers, neither by word nor gesture, made the\r\nslightest acknowledgment of this familiar greeting.\r\n\r\n“What news can you give us of France, England, or Russia?” continued\r\nServadac, perfectly unconscious of the stolid rigidity with which his\r\nadvances were received. “We are anxious to hear anything you can tell\r\nus. Have you had communications with Europe? Have you--”\r\n\r\n“To whom have we the honor of speaking?” at last interposed Colonel\r\nMurphy, in the coldest and most measured tone, and drawing himself up to\r\nhis full height.\r\n\r\n“Ah! how stupid! I forgot,” said Servadac, with the slightest possible\r\nshrug of the shoulders; “we have not been introduced.”\r\n\r\nThen, with a wave of his hand towards his companion, who meanwhile had\r\nexhibited a reserve hardly less than that of the British officers, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Allow me to introduce you to Count Wassili Timascheff.”\r\n\r\n“Major Sir John Temple Oliphant,” replied the colonel.\r\n\r\nThe Russian and the Englishman mutually exchanged the stiffest of bows.\r\n\r\n“I have the pleasure of introducing Captain Servadac,” said the count in\r\nhis turn.\r\n\r\n“And this is Colonel Heneage Finch Murphy,” was the major’s grave\r\nrejoinder.\r\n\r\nMore bows were interchanged and the ceremony brought to its due\r\nconclusion. It need hardly be said that the conversation had been\r\ncarried on in French, a language which is generally known both by\r\nRussians and Englishmen--a circumstance that is probably in some measure\r\nto be accounted for by the refusal of Frenchmen to learn either Russian\r\nor English.\r\n\r\nThe formal preliminaries of etiquette being thus complete, there was no\r\nlonger any obstacle to a freer intercourse. The colonel, signing to\r\nhis guests to follow, led the way to the apartment occupied jointly by\r\nhimself and the major, which, although only a kind of casemate hollowed\r\nin the rock, nevertheless wore a general air of comfort. Major\r\nOliphant accompanied them, and all four having taken their seats, the\r\nconversation was commenced.\r\n\r\nIrritated and disgusted at all the cold formalities, Hector Servadac\r\nresolved to leave all the talking to the count; and he, quite aware that\r\nthe Englishmen would adhere to the fiction that they could be supposed\r\nto know nothing that had transpired previous to the introduction felt\r\nhimself obliged to recapitulate matters from the very beginning.\r\n\r\n“You must be aware, gentlemen,” began the count, “that a most singular\r\ncatastrophe occurred on the 1st of January last. Its cause, its limits\r\nwe have utterly failed to discover, but from the appearance of the\r\nisland on which we find you here, you have evidently experienced its\r\ndevastating consequences.”\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen, in silence, bowed assent.\r\n\r\n“Captain Servadac, who accompanies me,” continued the count, “has been\r\nmost severely tried by the disaster. Engaged as he was in an important\r\nmission as a staff-officer in Algeria--”\r\n\r\n“A French colony, I believe,” interposed Major Oliphant, half shutting\r\nhis eyes with an expression of supreme indifference.\r\n\r\nServadac was on the point of making some cutting retort, but Count\r\nTimascheff, without allowing the interruption to be noticed, calmly\r\ncontinued his narrative:\r\n\r\n“It was near the mouth of the Shelif that a portion of Africa, on that\r\neventful night, was transformed into an island which alone survived; the\r\nrest of the vast continent disappeared as completely as if it had never\r\nbeen.”\r\n\r\nThe announcement seemed by no means startling to the phlegmatic colonel.\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” was all he said.\r\n\r\n“And where were you?” asked Major Oliphant.\r\n\r\n“I was out at sea, cruising in my yacht; hard by; and I look upon it as\r\na miracle, and nothing less, that I and my crew escaped with our lives.”\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you on your luck,” replied the major.\r\n\r\nThe count resumed: “It was about a month after the great disruption\r\nthat I was sailing--my engine having sustained some damage in the\r\nshock--along the Algerian coast, and had the pleasure of meeting with\r\nmy previous acquaintance, Captain Servadac, who was resident upon the\r\nisland with his orderly, Ben Zoof.”\r\n\r\n“Ben who?” inquired the major.\r\n\r\n“Zoof! Ben Zoof!” ejaculated Servadac, who could scarcely shout loud\r\nenough to relieve his pent-up feelings.\r\n\r\nIgnoring this ebullition of the captain’s spleen, the count went on to\r\nsay: “Captain Servadac was naturally most anxious to get what news he\r\ncould. Accordingly, he left his servant on the island in charge of his\r\nhorses, and came on board the _Dobryna_ with me. We were quite at a loss\r\nto know where we should steer, but decided to direct our course to\r\nwhat previously had been the east, in order that we might, if possible,\r\ndiscover the colony of Algeria; but of Algeria not a trace remained.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel curled his lip, insinuating only too plainly that to him it\r\nwas by no means surprising that a French colony should be wanting in the\r\nelement of stability. Servadac observed the supercilious look, and half\r\nrose to his feet, but, smothering his resentment, took his seat again\r\nwithout speaking.\r\n\r\n“The devastation, gentlemen,” said the count, who persistently refused\r\nto recognize the Frenchman’s irritation, “everywhere was terrible and\r\ncomplete. Not only was Algeria lost, but there was no trace of Tunis,\r\nexcept one solitary rock, which was crowned by an ancient tomb of one of\r\nthe kings of France--”\r\n\r\n“Louis the Ninth, I presume,” observed the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Saint Louis,” blurted out Servadac, savagely.\r\n\r\nColonel Murphy slightly smiled.\r\n\r\nProof against all interruption, Count Timascheff, as if he had not heard\r\nit, went on without pausing. He related how the schooner had pushed her\r\nway onwards to the south, and had reached the Gulf of Cabes; and how\r\nshe had ascertained for certain that the Sahara Sea had no longer an\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe smile of disdain again crossed the colonel’s face; he could not\r\nconceal his opinion that such a destiny for the work of a Frenchman\r\ncould be no matter of surprise.\r\n\r\n“Our next discovery,” continued the count, “was that a new coast\r\nhad been upheaved right along in front of the coast of Tripoli, the\r\ngeological formation of which was altogether strange, and which extended\r\nto the north as far as the proper place of Malta.”\r\n\r\n“And Malta,” cried Servadac, unable to control himself any longer;\r\n“Malta--town, forts, soldiers, governor, and all--has vanished just like\r\nAlgeria.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment a cloud rested upon the colonel’s brow, only to give place\r\nto an expression of decided incredulity.\r\n\r\n“The statement seems highly incredible,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Incredible?” repeated Servadac. “Why is it that you doubt my word?”\r\n\r\nThe captain’s rising wrath did not prevent the colonel from replying\r\ncoolly, “Because Malta belongs to England.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help that,” answered Servadac, sharply; “it has gone just as\r\nutterly as if it had belonged to China.”\r\n\r\nColonel Murphy turned deliberately away from Servadac, and appealed to\r\nthe count: “Do you not think you may have made some error, count, in\r\nreckoning the bearings of your yacht?”\r\n\r\n“No, colonel, I am quite certain of my reckonings; and not only can\r\nI testify that Malta has disappeared, but I can affirm that a large\r\nsection of the Mediterranean has been closed in by a new continent.\r\nAfter the most anxious investigation, we could discover only one narrow\r\nopening in all the coast, and it is by following that little channel\r\nthat we have made our way hither. England, I fear, has suffered\r\ngrievously by the late catastrophe. Not only has Malta been entirely\r\nlost, but of the Ionian Islands that were under England’s protection,\r\nthere seems to be but little left.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, you may depend upon it,” said Servadac, breaking in upon the\r\nconversation petulantly, “your grand resident lord high commissioner has\r\nnot much to congratulate himself about in the condition of Corfu.”\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen were mystified.\r\n\r\n“Corfu, did you say?” asked Major Oliphant.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Corfu; I said Corfu,” replied Servadac, with a sort of malicious\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThe officers were speechless with astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe silence of bewilderment was broken at length by Count Timascheff\r\nmaking inquiry whether nothing had been heard from England, either by\r\ntelegraph or by any passing ship.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the colonel; “not a ship has passed; and the cable is\r\nbroken.”\r\n\r\n“But do not the Italian telegraphs assist you?” continued the count.\r\n\r\n“Italian! I do not comprehend you. You must mean the Spanish, surely.”\r\n\r\n“How?” demanded Timascheff.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” cried the impatient Servadac. “What matters whether it be\r\nSpanish or Italian? Tell us, have you had no communication at all from\r\nEurope?--no news of any sort from London?”\r\n\r\n“Hitherto, none whatever,” replied the colonel; adding with a stately\r\nemphasis, “but we shall be sure to have tidings from England before\r\nlong.”\r\n\r\n“Whether England is still in existence or not, I suppose,” said\r\nServadac, in a tone of irony.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen started simultaneously to their feet.\r\n\r\n“England in existence?” the colonel cried. “England! Ten times more\r\nprobable that France--”\r\n\r\n“France!” shouted Servadac in a passion. “France is not an island that\r\ncan be submerged; France is an integral portion of a solid continent.\r\nFrance, at least, is safe.”\r\n\r\nA scene appeared inevitable, and Count Timascheff’s efforts to\r\nconciliate the excited parties were of small avail.\r\n\r\n“You are at home here,” said Servadac, with as much calmness as he\r\ncould command; “it will be advisable, I think, for this discussion to\r\nbe carried on in the open air.” And hurriedly he left the room. Followed\r\nimmediately by the others, he led the way to a level piece of ground,\r\nwhich he considered he might fairly claim as neutral territory.\r\n\r\n“Now, gentlemen,” he began haughtily, “permit me to represent that,\r\nin spite of any loss France may have sustained in the fate of Algeria,\r\nFrance is ready to answer any provocation that affects her honor. Here I\r\nam the representative of my country, and here, on neutral ground--”\r\n\r\n“Neutral ground?” objected Colonel Murphy; “I beg your pardon. This,\r\nCaptain Servadac, is English territory. Do you not see the English\r\nflag?” and, as he spoke, he pointed with national pride to the British\r\nstandard floating over the top of the island.\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” cried Servadac, with a contemptuous sneer; “that flag, you\r\nknow, has been hoisted but a few short weeks.”\r\n\r\n“That flag has floated where it is for ages,” asserted the colonel.\r\n\r\n“An imposture!” shouted Servadac, as he stamped with rage.\r\n\r\nRecovering his composure in a degree, he continued: “Can you suppose\r\nthat I am not aware that this island on which we find you is what\r\nremains of the Ionian representative republic, over which you English\r\nexercise the right of protection, but have no claim of government?”\r\n\r\nThe colonel and the major looked at each other in amazement.\r\n\r\nAlthough Count Timascheff secretly sympathized with Servadac, he had\r\ncarefully refrained from taking part in the dispute; but he was on\r\nthe point of interfering, when the colonel, in a greatly subdued tone,\r\nbegged to be allowed to speak.\r\n\r\n“I begin to apprehend,” he said, “that you must be la-boring under some\r\nstrange mistake. There is no room for questioning that the territory\r\nhere is England’s--England’s by right of conquest; ceded to England\r\nby the Treaty of Utrecht. Three times, indeed--in 1727, 1779, and\r\n1792--France and Spain have disputed our title, but always to no\r\npurpose. You are, I assure you, at the present moment, as much on\r\nEnglish soil as if you were in London, in the middle of Trafalgar\r\nSquare.”\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of the captain and the count to look surprised. “Are\r\nwe not, then, in Corfu?” they asked.\r\n\r\n“You are at Gibraltar,” replied the colonel.\r\n\r\nGibraltar! The word fell like a thunderclap upon their ears. Gibraltar!\r\nthe western extremity of the Mediterranean! Why, had they not been\r\nsailing persistently to the east? Could they be wrong in imagining that\r\nthey had reached the Ionian Islands? What new mystery was this?\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff was about to proceed with a more rigorous\r\ninvestigation, when the attention of all was arrested by a loud outcry.\r\nTurning round, they saw that the crew of the _Dobryna_ was in hot\r\ndispute with the English soldiers. A general altercation had arisen\r\nfrom a disagreement between the sailor Panofka and Corporal Pim. It had\r\ntranspired that the cannon-ball fired in experiment from the island\r\nhad not only damaged one of the spars of the schooner, but had broken\r\nPanofka’s pipe, and, moreover, had just grazed his nose, which, for a\r\nRussian’s, was unusually long. The discussion over this mishap led to\r\nmutual recriminations, till the sailors had almost come to blows with\r\nthe garrison.\r\n\r\nServadac was just in the mood to take Panofka’s part, which drew from\r\nMajor Oliphant the remark that England could not be held responsible for\r\nany accidental injury done by her cannon, and if the Russian’s long nose\r\ncame in the way of the ball, the Russian must submit to the mischance.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Count Timascheff, and having poured out a torrent\r\nof angry invective against the English officers, he ordered his crew to\r\nembark immediately.\r\n\r\n“We shall meet again,” said Servadac, as they pushed off from shore.\r\n\r\n“Whenever you please,” was the cool reply.\r\n\r\nThe geographical mystery haunted the minds of both the count and the\r\ncaptain, and they felt they could never rest till they had ascertained\r\nwhat had become of their respective countries. They were glad to be on\r\nboard again, that they might résumé their voyage of investigation,\r\nand in two hours were out of sight of the sole remaining fragment of\r\nGibraltar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. AN ENIGMA FROM THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope had been left on board in charge of the _Dobryna_,\r\nand on resuming the voyage it was a task of some difficulty to make him\r\nunderstand the fact that had just come to light. Some hours were spent\r\nin discussion and in attempting to penetrate the mysteries of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThere were certain things of which they were perfectly certain. They\r\ncould be under no misapprehension as to the distance they had positively\r\nsailed from Gourbi Island towards the east before their further progress\r\nwas arrested by the unknown shore; as nearly as possible that was\r\nfifteen degrees; the length of the narrow strait by which they had made\r\ntheir way across that land to regain the open sea was about three miles\r\nand a half; thence onward to the island, which they had been assured,\r\non evidence that they could not disbelieve, to be upon the site of\r\nGibraltar, was four degrees; while from Gibraltar to Gourbi Island was\r\nseven degrees or but little more. What was it altogether? Was it not\r\nless than thirty degrees? In that latitude, the degree of longitude\r\nrepresents eight and forty miles. What, then, did it all amount to?\r\nIndubitably, to less than 1,400 miles. So brief a voyage would bring the\r\n_Dobryna_ once again to her starting-point, or, in other words, would\r\nenable her to complete the circumnavigation of the globe. How changed\r\nthe condition of things! Previously, to sail from Malta to Gibraltar by\r\nan eastward course would have involved the passage of the Suez Canal,\r\nthe Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific, the Atlantic; but what had\r\nhappened now? Why, Gibraltar had been reached as if it had been just at\r\nCorfu, and some three hundred and thirty degrees of the earth’s circuit\r\nhad vanished utterly.\r\n\r\nAfter allowing for a certain margin of miscalculation, the main fact\r\nremained undeniable; and the necessary inference that Lieutenant Procope\r\ndrew from the round of the earth being completed in 1,400 miles, was\r\nthat the earth’s diameter had been reduced by about fifteen sixteenths\r\nof its length.\r\n\r\n“If that be so,” observed the count, “it accounts for some of the\r\nstrange phenomena we witness. If our world has become so insignificant a\r\nspheroid, not only has its gravity diminished, but its rotary speed has\r\nbeen accelerated; and this affords an adequate explanation of our days\r\nand nights being thus curtailed. But how about the new orbit in which we\r\nare moving?”\r\n\r\nHe paused and pondered, and then looked at Procope as though awaiting\r\nfrom him some further elucidation of the difficulty. The lieutenant\r\nhesitated. When, in a few moments, he began to speak, Servadac smiled\r\nintelligently, anticipating the answer he was about to hear.\r\n\r\n“My conjecture is,” said Procope, “that a fragment of considerable\r\nmagnitude has been detached from the earth; that it has carried with\r\nit an envelope of the earth’s atmosphere, and that it is now traveling\r\nthrough the solar system in an orbit that does not correspond at all\r\nwith the proper orbit of the earth.”\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis was plausible; but what a multitude of bewildering\r\nspeculations it entailed! If, in truth, a certain mass had been broken\r\noff from the terrestrial sphere, whither would it wend its way? What\r\nwould be the measure of the eccentricity of its path? What would be its\r\nperiod round the sun? Might it not, like a comet, be carried away into\r\nthe vast infinity of space? or, on the other hand, might it not be\r\nattracted to the great central source of light and heat, and be absorbed\r\nin it? Did its orbit correspond with the orbit of the ecliptic? and was\r\nthere no chance of its ever uniting again with the globe, from which it\r\nhad been torn off by so sudden and violent a disruption?\r\n\r\nA thoughtful silence fell upon them all, which Servadac was the first\r\nto break. “Lieutenant,” he said, “your explanation is ingenious, and\r\naccounts for many appearances; but it seems to me that in one point it\r\nfails.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” replied Procope. “To my mind the theory meets all objections.”\r\n\r\n“I think not,” Servadac answered. “In one point, at least, it appears to\r\nme to break down completely.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“Stop a moment,” said the captain. “Let us see that we understand each\r\nother right. Unless I mistake you, your hypothesis is that a fragment of\r\nthe earth, comprising the Mediterranean and its shores from Gibraltar\r\nto Malta, has been developed into a new asteroid, which is started on an\r\nindependent orbit in the solar regions. Is not that your meaning?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely so,” the lieutenant acquiesced.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” continued Servadac, “it seems to me to be at fault in this\r\nrespect: it fails, and fails completely, to account for the geological\r\ncharacter of the land that we have found now encompassing this sea. Why,\r\nif the new land is a fragment of the old--why does it not retain its old\r\nformation? What has become of the granite and the calcareous deposits?\r\nHow is it that these should all be changed into a mineral concrete with\r\nwhich we have no acquaintance?”\r\n\r\nNo doubt, it was a serious objection; for, however likely it might be\r\nthat a mass of the earth on being detached would be eccentric in its\r\nmovements, there was no probable reason to be alleged why the material\r\nof its substance should undergo so complete a change. There was nothing\r\nto account for the fertile shores, rich in vegetation, being transformed\r\ninto rocks arid and barren beyond precedent.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant felt the difficulty, and owned himself unprepared to give\r\nat once an adequate solution; nevertheless, he declined to renounce his\r\ntheory. He asserted that the arguments in favor of it carried conviction\r\nto his mind, and that he entertained no doubt but that, in the course of\r\ntime, all apparently antagonistic circumstances would be explained so as\r\nto become consistent with the view he took. He was careful, however,\r\nto make it understood that with respect to the original cause of\r\nthe disruption he had no theory to offer; and although he knew what\r\nexpansion might be the result of subterranean forces, he did not venture\r\nto say that he considered it sufficient to produce so tremendous an\r\neffect. The origin of the catastrophe was a problem still to be solved.\r\n\r\n“Ah! well,” said Servadac, “I don’t know that it matters much where our\r\nnew little planet comes from, or what it is made of, if only it carries\r\nFrance along with it.”\r\n\r\n“And Russia,” added the count.\r\n\r\n“And Russia, of course,” said Servadac, with a polite bow.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, not much room for this sanguine expectation, for if\r\na new asteroid had thus been brought into existence, it must be a sphere\r\nof extremely limited dimensions, and there could be little chance that\r\nit embraced more than the merest fraction of either France or Russia. As\r\nto England, the total cessation of all telegraphic communication between\r\nher shores and Gibraltar was a virtual proof that England was beyond its\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the true measurement of the new little world? At Gourbi\r\nIsland the days and nights were of equal length, and this seemed to\r\nindicate that it was situated on the equator; hence the distance by\r\nwhich the two poles stood apart would be half what had been reckoned\r\nwould be the distance completed by the _Dobryna_ in her circuit. That\r\ndistance had been already estimated to be something under 1,400 miles,\r\nso that the Arctic Pole of their recently fashioned world must be about\r\n350 miles to the north, and the Antarctic about 350 miles to the south\r\nof the island. Compare these calculations with the map, and it is at\r\nonce apparent that the northernmost limit barely touched the coast of\r\nProvence, while the southernmost reached to about lat. 20 degrees\r\nN., and fell in the heart of the desert. The practical test of these\r\nconclusions would be made by future investigation, but meanwhile\r\nthe fact appeared very much to strengthen the presumption that, if\r\nLieutenant Procope had not arrived at the whole truth, he had made a\r\nconsiderable advance towards it.\r\n\r\nThe weather, ever since the storm that had driven the _Dobryna_ into the\r\ncreek, had been magnificent. The wind continued favorable, and now under\r\nboth steam and canvas, she made a rapid progress towards the north,\r\na direction in which she was free to go in consequence of the total\r\ndisappearance of the Spanish coast, from Gibraltar right away to\r\nAlicante. Malaga, Almeria, Cape Gata, Carthagena. Cape Palos--all were\r\ngone. The sea was rolling over the southern extent of the peninsula, so\r\nthat the yacht advanced to the latitude of Seville before it sighted any\r\nland at all, and then, not shores such as the shores of Andalusia, but\r\na bluff and precipitous cliff, in its geological features resembling\r\nexactly the stern and barren rock that she had coasted beyond the site\r\nof Malta. Here the sea made a decided indentation on the coast; it ran\r\nup in an acute-angled triangle till its apex coincided with the very\r\nspot upon which Madrid had stood. But as hitherto the sea had encroached\r\nupon the land, the land in its turn now encroached upon the sea; for a\r\nfrowning headland stood out far into the basin of the Mediterranean,\r\nand formed a promontory stretching out beyond the proper places of\r\nthe Balearic Isles. Curiosity was all alive. There was the intensest\r\ninterest awakened to determine whether no vestige could be traced of\r\nMajorca, Minorca, or any of the group, and it was during a deviation\r\nfrom the direct course for the purpose of a more thorough scrutiny, that\r\none of the sailors raised a thrill of general excitement by shouting, “A\r\nbottle in the sea!”\r\n\r\nHere, then, at length was a communication from the outer world. Surely\r\nnow they would find a document which would throw some light upon all the\r\nmysteries that had happened? Had not the day now dawned that should set\r\ntheir speculations all at rest?\r\n\r\nIt was the morning of the 21st of February. The count, the captain,\r\nthe lieutenant, everybody hurried to the forecastle; the schooner was\r\ndexterously put about, and all was eager impatience until the supposed\r\nbottle was hauled on deck.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, a bottle; it proved to be a round leather\r\ntelescope-case, about a foot long, and the first thing to do before\r\ninvestigating its contents was to make a careful examination of its\r\nexterior. The lid was fastened on by wax, and so securely that it would\r\ntake a long immersion before any water could penetrate; there was no\r\nmaker’s name to be deciphered; but impressed very plainly with a seal on\r\nthe wax were the two initials “P. R.”\r\n\r\nWhen the scrutiny of the outside was finished, the wax was removed and\r\nthe cover opened, and the lieutenant drew out a slip of ruled paper,\r\nevidently torn from a common note-book. The paper had an inscription\r\nwritten in four lines, which were remarkable for the profusion of notes\r\nof admiration and interrogation with which they were interspersed:\r\n\r\n     “Gallia???\r\n     _Ab sole_, au 15 fev. 59,000,000 l.!\r\n     Chemin parcouru de janv. a fev. 82,000,000 l.!!\r\n     _Va bene! All right!!_ Parfait!!!”\r\n\r\nThere was a general sigh of disappointment. They turned the paper over\r\nand over, and handed it from one to another. “What does it all mean?”\r\n exclaimed the count.\r\n\r\n“Something mysterious here!” said Servadac. “But yet,” he continued,\r\nafter a pause, “one thing is tolerably certain: on the 15th, six days\r\nago, someone was alive to write it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I presume there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the date,”\r\n assented the count.\r\n\r\nTo this strange conglomeration of French, English, Italian, and Latin,\r\nthere was no signature attached; nor was there anything to give a\r\nclue as to the locality in which it had been committed to the waves.\r\nA telescope-case would probably be the property of some one on board\r\na ship; and the figures obviously referred to the astronomical wonders\r\nthat had been experienced.\r\n\r\nTo these general observations Captain Servadac objected that he thought\r\nit unlikely that any one on board a ship would use a telescope-case for\r\nthis purpose, but would be sure to use a bottle as being more secure;\r\nand, accordingly, he should rather be inclined to believe that the\r\nmessage had been set afloat by some _savant_ left alone, perchance, upon\r\nsome isolated coast.\r\n\r\n“But, however interesting it might be,” observed the count, “to know\r\nthe author of the lines, to us it is of far greater moment to ascertain\r\ntheir meaning.”\r\n\r\nAnd taking up the paper again, he said, “Perhaps we might analyze it\r\nword by word, and from its detached parts gather some clue to its sense\r\nas a whole.”\r\n\r\n“What can be the meaning of all that cluster of interrogations after\r\nGallia?” asked Servadac.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope, who had hitherto not spoken, now broke his silence\r\nby saying, “I beg, gentlemen, to submit my opinion that this document\r\ngoes very far to confirm my hypothesis that a fragment of the earth has\r\nbeen precipitated into space.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac hesitated, and then replied, “Even if it does, I do not\r\nsee how it accounts in the least for the geological character of the new\r\nasteroid.”\r\n\r\n“But will you allow me for one minute to take my supposition for\r\ngranted?” said Procope. “If a new little planet has been formed, as I\r\nimagine, by disintegration from the old, I should conjecture that Gallia\r\nis the name assigned to it by the writer of this paper. The very notes\r\nof interrogation are significant that he was in doubt what he should\r\nwrite.”\r\n\r\n“You would presume that he was a Frenchman?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n“I should think so,” replied the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“Not much doubt about that,” said Servadac; “it is all in French,\r\nexcept a few scattered words of English, Latin, and Italian, inserted to\r\nattract attention. He could not tell into whose hands the message would\r\nfall first.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Count Timascheff, “we seem to have found a name for\r\nthe new world we occupy.”\r\n\r\n“But what I was going especially to observe,” continued the lieutenant,\r\n“is that the distance, 59,000,000 leagues, represents precisely the\r\ndistance we ourselves were from the sun on the 15th. It was on that day\r\nwe crossed the orbit of Mars.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, true,” assented the others.\r\n\r\n“And the next line,” said the lieutenant, after reading it aloud,\r\n“apparently registers the distance traversed by Gallia, the new little\r\nplanet, in her own orbit. Her speed, of course, we know by Kepler’s\r\nlaws, would vary according to her distance from the sun, and if she\r\nwere--as I conjecture from the temperature at that date--on the 15th of\r\nJanuary at her perihelion, she would be traveling twice as fast as the\r\nearth, which moves at the rate of between 50,000 and 60,000 miles an\r\nhour.”\r\n\r\n“You think, then,” said Servadac, with a smile, “you have determined\r\nthe perihelion of our orbit; but how about the aphelion? Can you form a\r\njudgment as to what distance we are likely to be carried?”\r\n\r\n“You are asking too much,” remonstrated the count.\r\n\r\n“I confess,” said the lieutenant, “that just at present I am not able to\r\nclear away the uncertainty of the future; but I feel confident that by\r\ncareful observation at various points we shall arrive at conclusions\r\nwhich not only will determine our path, but perhaps may clear up the\r\nmystery about our geological structure.”\r\n\r\n“Allow me to ask,” said Count Timascheff, “whether such a new asteroid\r\nwould not be subject to ordinary mechanical laws, and whether, once\r\nstarted, it would not have an orbit that must be immutable?”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly it would, so long as it was undisturbed by the attraction\r\nof some considerable body; but we must recollect that, compared to the\r\ngreat planets, Gallia must be almost infinitesimally small, and so might\r\nbe attracted by a force that is irresistible.”\r\n\r\n“Altogether, then,” said Servadac, “we seem to have settled it to our\r\nentire satisfaction that we must be the population of a young little\r\nworld called Gallia. Perhaps some day we may have the honor of being\r\nregistered among the minor planets.”\r\n\r\n“No chance of that,” quickly rejoined Lieutenant Procope. “Those minor\r\nplanets all are known to rotate in a narrow zone between the orbits of\r\nMars and Jupiter; in their perihelia they cannot approximate the sun as\r\nwe have done; we shall not be classed with them.”\r\n\r\n“Our lack of instruments,” said the count, “is much to be deplored; it\r\nbaffles our investigations in every way.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, never mind! Keep up your courage, count!” said Servadac, cheerily.\r\n\r\nAnd Lieutenant Procope renewed his assurances that he entertained good\r\nhopes that every perplexity would soon be solved.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” remarked the count, “that we cannot attribute much\r\nimportance to the last line: _‘Va bene! All right!!_ Parfait!!!’”\r\n\r\nThe captain answered, “At least, it shows that whoever wrote it had no\r\nmurmuring or complaint to make, but was quite content with the new order\r\nof things.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. THE RESIDUUM OF A CONTINENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost unconsciously, the voyagers in the _Dobryna_ fell into the habit\r\nof using Gallia as the name of the new world in which they became aware\r\nthey must be making an extraordinary excursion through the realms\r\nof space. Nothing, however, was allowed to divert them from their\r\nostensible object of making a survey of the coast of the Mediterranean,\r\nand accordingly they persevered in following that singular boundary\r\nwhich had revealed itself to their extreme astonishment.\r\n\r\nHaving rounded the great promontory that had barred her farther progress\r\nto the north, the schooner skirted its upper edge. A few more leagues\r\nand they ought to be abreast of the shores of France. Yes, of France.\r\n\r\nBut who shall describe the feelings of Hector Servadac when, instead of\r\nthe charming outline of his native land, he beheld nothing but a solid\r\nboundary of savage rock? Who shall paint the look of consternation with\r\nwhich he gazed upon the stony rampart--rising perpendicularly for a\r\nthousand feet--that had replaced the shores of the smiling south? Who\r\nshall reveal the burning anxiety with which he throbbed to see beyond\r\nthat cruel wall?\r\n\r\nBut there seemed no hope. Onwards and onwards the yacht made her way,\r\nand still no sign of France. It might have been supposed that Servadac’s\r\nprevious experiences would have prepared him for the discovery that the\r\ncatastrophe which had overwhelmed other sites had brought destruction\r\nto his own country as well. But he had failed to realize how it might\r\nextend to France; and when now he was obliged with his own eyes to\r\nwitness the waves of ocean rolling over what once had been the lovely\r\nshores of Provence, he was well-nigh frantic with desperation.\r\n\r\n“Am I to believe that Gourbi Island, that little shred of Algeria,\r\nconstitutes all that is left of our glorious France? No, no; it cannot\r\nbe. Not yet have we reached the pole of our new world. There is--there\r\nmust be--something more behind that frowning rock. Oh, that for a moment\r\nwe could scale its towering height and look beyond! By Heaven, I adjure\r\nyou, let us disembark, and mount the summit and explore! France lies\r\nbeyond.”\r\n\r\nDisembarkation, however, was an utter impossibility. There was no\r\nsemblance of a creek in which the _Dobryna_ could find an anchorage.\r\nThere was no outlying ridge on which a footing could be gained. The\r\nprecipice was perpendicular as a wall, its topmost height crowned with\r\nthe same conglomerate of crystallized lamellae that had all along been\r\nso pronounced a feature.\r\n\r\nWith her steam at high pressure, the yacht made rapid progress towards\r\nthe east. The weather remained perfectly fine, the temperature\r\nbecame gradually cooler, so that there was little prospect of vapors\r\naccumulating in the atmosphere; and nothing more than a few cirri,\r\nalmost transparent, veiled here and there the clear azure of the sky.\r\nThroughout the day the pale rays of the sun, apparently lessened in its\r\nmagnitude, cast only faint and somewhat uncertain shadows; but at night\r\nthe stars shone with surpassing brilliancy. Of the planets, some, it was\r\nobserved, seemed to be fading away in remote distance. This was the case\r\nwith Mars, Venus, and that unknown orb which was moving in the orbit of\r\nthe minor planets; but Jupiter, on the other hand, had assumed splendid\r\nproportions; Saturn was superb in its luster, and Uranus, which hitherto\r\nhad been imperceptible without a telescope was pointed out by\r\nLieutenant Procope, plainly visible to the naked eye. The inference was\r\nirresistible that Gallia was receding from the sun, and traveling far\r\naway across the planetary regions.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, after following the sinuous course of what\r\nbefore the date of the convulsion had been the coast line of the\r\ndepartment of Var, and after a fruitless search for Hyeres, the\r\npeninsula of St. Tropez, the Lerius Islands, and the gulfs of Cannes and\r\nJouar, the _Dobryna_ arrived upon the site of the Cape of Antibes.\r\n\r\nHere, quite unexpectedly, the explorers made the discovery that the\r\nmassive wall of cliff had been rent from the top to the bottom by a\r\nnarrow rift, like the dry bed of a mountain torrent, and at the base of\r\nthe opening, level with the sea, was a little strand upon which there\r\nwas just space enough for their boat to be hauled up.\r\n\r\n“Joy! joy!” shouted Servadac, half beside himself with ecstasy; “we can\r\nland at last!”\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff and the lieutenant were scarcely less impatient than\r\nthe captain, and little needed his urgent and repeated solicitations:\r\n“Come on! Quick! Come on! no time to lose!”\r\n\r\nIt was half-past seven in the morning, when they set their foot upon\r\nthis untried land. The bit of strand was only a few square yards in\r\narea, quite a narrow strip. Upon it might have been recognized\r\nsome fragments of that agglutination of yellow limestone which is\r\ncharacteristic of the coast of Provence. But the whole party was far\r\ntoo eager to wait and examine these remnants of the ancient shore; they\r\nhurried on to scale the heights.\r\n\r\nThe narrow ravine was not only perfectly dry, but manifestly had never\r\nbeen the bed of any mountain torrent. The rocks that rested at the\r\nbottom--just as those which formed its sides--were of the same lamellous\r\nformation as the entire coast, and had not hitherto been subject to the\r\ndisaggregation which the lapse of time never fails to work. A skilled\r\ngeologist would probably have been able to assign them their proper\r\nscientific classification, but neither Servadac, Timascheff, nor\r\nthe lieutenant could pretend to any acquaintance with their specific\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAlthough, however, the bottom of the chasm had never as yet been the\r\nchannel of a stream, indications were not wanting that at some future\r\ntime it would be the natural outlet of accumulated waters; for already,\r\nin many places, thin layers of snow were glittering upon the surface of\r\nthe fractured rocks, and the higher the elevation that was gained, the\r\nmore these layers were found to increase in area and in depth.\r\n\r\n“Here is a trace of fresh water, the first that Gallia has exhibited,”\r\n said the count to his companions, as they toiled up the precipitous\r\npath.\r\n\r\n“And probably,” replied the lieutenant, “as we ascend we shall find not\r\nonly snow but ice. We must suppose this Gallia of ours to be a sphere,\r\nand if it is so, we must now be very close to her Arctic regions; it is\r\ntrue that her axis is not so much inclined as to prolong day and night\r\nas at the poles of the earth, but the rays of the sun must reach us here\r\nonly very obliquely, and the cold, in all likelihood, will be intense.”\r\n\r\n“So cold, do you think,” asked Servadac, “that animal life must be\r\nextinct?”\r\n\r\n“I do not say that, captain,” answered the lieutenant; “for, however\r\nfar our little world may be removed from the sun, I do not see why its\r\ntemperature should fall below what prevails in those outlying regions\r\nbeyond our system where sky and air are not.” “And what temperature may\r\nthat be?” inquired the captain with a shudder.\r\n\r\n“Fourier estimates that even in those vast unfathomable tracts, the\r\ntemperature never descends lower than 60 degrees,” said Procope.\r\n\r\n“Sixty! Sixty degrees below zero!” cried the count. “Why, there’s not a\r\nRussian could endure it!”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, count. It is placed on record that the English\r\n_have_ survived it, or something quite approximate, upon their Arctic\r\nexpeditions. When Captain Parry was on Melville Island, he knew the\r\nthermometer to fall to 56 degrees,” said Procope.\r\n\r\nAs the explorers advanced, they seemed glad to pause from time to time,\r\nthat they might recover their breath; for the air, becoming more and\r\nmore rarefied, made respiration somewhat difficult and the ascent\r\nfatiguing. Before they had reached an altitude of 600 feet they noticed\r\na sensible diminution of the temperature; but neither cold nor fatigue\r\ndeterred them, and they were resolved to persevere. Fortunately, the\r\ndeep striae or furrows in the surface of the rocks that made the bottom\r\nof the ravine in some degree facilitated their progress, but it was not\r\nuntil they had been toiling up for two hours more that they succeeded in\r\nreaching the summit of the cliff.\r\n\r\nEagerly and anxiously did they look around. To the south there was\r\nnothing but the sea they had traversed; to the north, nothing but one\r\ndrear, inhospitable stretch.\r\n\r\nServadac could not suppress a cry of dismay. Where was his beloved\r\nFrance? Had he gained this arduous height only to behold the rocks\r\ncarpeted with ice and snow, and reaching interminably to the far-off\r\nhorizon? His heart sank within him.\r\n\r\nThe whole region appeared to consist of nothing but the same strange,\r\nuniform mineral conglomerate, crystallized into regular hexagonal\r\nprisms. But whatever was its geological character, it was only too\r\nevident that it had entirely replaced the former soil, so that not a\r\nvestige of the old continent of Europe could be discerned. The\r\nlovely scenery of Provence, with the grace of its rich and undulating\r\nlandscape; its gardens of citrons and oranges rising tier upon tier\r\nfrom the deep red soil--all, all had vanished. Of the vegetable kingdom,\r\nthere was not a single representative; the most meager of Arctic plants,\r\nthe most insignificant of lichens, could obtain no hold upon that stony\r\nwaste. Nor did the animal world assert the feeblest sway. The mineral\r\nkingdom reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac’s deep dejection was in strange contrast to his general\r\nhilarity. Silent and tearful, he stood upon an ice-bound rock, straining\r\nhis eyes across the boundless vista of the mysterious territory. “It\r\ncannot be!” he exclaimed. “We must somehow have mistaken our bearings.\r\nTrue, we have encountered this barrier; but France is there beyond! Yes,\r\nFrance is _there!_ Come, count, come! By all that’s pitiful, I entreat\r\nyou, come and explore the farthest verge of the ice-bound track!”\r\n\r\nHe pushed onwards along the rugged surface of the rock, but had not\r\nproceeded far before he came to a sudden pause. His foot had come in\r\ncontact with something hard beneath the snow, and, stooping down, he\r\npicked up a little block of stony substance, which the first glance\r\nrevealed to be of a geological character altogether alien to the\r\nuniversal rocks around. It proved to be a fragment of dis-colored\r\nmarble, on which several letters were inscribed, of which the only part\r\nat all decipherable was the syllable “Vil.”\r\n\r\n“Vil--Villa!” he cried out, in his excitement dropping the marble, which\r\nwas broken into atoms by the fall.\r\n\r\nWhat else could this fragment be but the sole surviving remnant of some\r\nsumptuous mansion that once had stood on this unrivaled site? Was it not\r\nthe residue of some edifice that had crowned the luxuriant headland of\r\nAntibes, overlooking Nice, and commanding the gorgeous panorama that\r\nembraced the Maritime Alps and reached beyond Monaco and Mentone to the\r\nItalian height of Bordighera? And did it not give in its sad and too\r\nconvincing testimony that Antibes itself had been involved in the great\r\ndestruction? Servadac gazed upon the shattered marble, pensive and\r\ndisheartened.\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff laid his hand kindly on the captain’s shoulder, and\r\nsaid, “My friend, do you not remember the motto of the old Hope family?”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head mournfully.\r\n\r\n“_Orbe fracto, spes illoesa_,” continued the count--“Though the world be\r\nshattered, hope is unimpaired.”\r\n\r\nServadac smiled faintly, and replied that he felt rather compelled to\r\ntake up the despairing cry of Dante, “All hope abandon, ye who enter\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, not so,” answered the count; “for the present at least, let our\r\nmaxim be _Nil desperandum!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. A SECOND ENIGMA\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon re-embarking, the bewildered explorers began to discuss the\r\nquestion whether it would not now be desirable to make their way back\r\nto Gourbi Island, which was apparently the only spot in their new world\r\nfrom which they could hope to derive their future sustenance. Captain\r\nServadac tried to console himself with the reflection that Gourbi Island\r\nwas, after all, a fragment of a French colony, and as such almost like\r\na bit of his dear France; and the plan of returning thither was on the\r\npoint of being adopted, when Lieutenant Procope remarked that they ought\r\nto remember that they had not hitherto made an entire circuit of the new\r\nshores of the sea on which they were sailing.\r\n\r\n“We have,” he said, “neither investigated the northern shore from the\r\nsite of Cape Antibes to the strait that brought us to Gibraltar, nor\r\nhave we followed the southern shore that stretches from the strait to\r\nthe Gulf of Cabes. It is the old coast, and not the new, that we have\r\nbeen tracing; as yet, we cannot say positively that there is no outlet\r\nto the south; as yet, we cannot assert that no oasis of the African\r\ndesert has escaped the catastrophe. Perhaps, even here in the north,\r\nwe may find that Italy and Sicily and the larger islands of the\r\nMediterranean may still maintain their existence.”\r\n\r\n“I entirely concur with you,” said Count Timascheff. “I quite think we\r\nought to make our survey of the confines of this new basin as complete\r\nas possible before we withdraw.”\r\n\r\nServadac, although he acknowledged the justness of these observations,\r\ncould not help pleading that the explorations might be deferred until\r\nafter a visit had been paid to Gourbi Island.\r\n\r\n“Depend upon it, captain, you are mistaken,” replied the lieutenant;\r\n“the right thing to do is to use the _Dobryna_ while she is available.”\r\n\r\n“Available! What do you mean?” asked the count, somewhat taken by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” said Procope, “that the farther this Gallia of ours recedes\r\nfrom the sun, the lower the temperature will fall. It is likely enough,\r\nI think, that before long the sea will be frozen over, and navigation\r\nwill be impossible. Already you have learned something of the\r\ndifficulties of traversing a field of ice, and I am sure, therefore, you\r\nwill acquiesce in my wish to continue our explorations while the water\r\nis still open.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt you are right, lieutenant,” said the count. “We will continue\r\nour search while we can for some remaining fragment of Europe. Who\r\nshall tell whether we may not meet with some more survivors from the\r\ncatastrophe, to whom it might be in our power to afford assistance,\r\nbefore we go into our winter quarters?”\r\n\r\nGenerous and altogether unselfish as this sentiment really was, it was\r\nobviously to the general interest that they should become acquainted,\r\nand if possible establish friendly relations, with any human inhabitant\r\nwho might be sharing their own strange destiny in being rolled away upon\r\na new planet into the infinitude of space. All difference of race, all\r\ndistinction of nationality, must be merged into the one thought that,\r\nfew as they were, they were the sole surviving representatives of a\r\nworld which it seemed exceedingly improbable that they would ever see\r\nagain; and common sense dictated that they were bound to direct all\r\ntheir energies to insure that their asteroid should at least have a\r\nunited and sympathizing population.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 25th of February that the yacht left the little creek in\r\nwhich she had taken refuge, and setting off at full steam eastwards,\r\nshe continued her way along the northern shore. A brisk breeze tended to\r\nincrease the keenness of the temperature, the thermometer being, on\r\nan average, about two degrees below zero. Salt water freezes only at a\r\nlower temperature than fresh; the course of the _Dobryna_ was therefore\r\nunimpeded by ice, but it could not be concealed that there was the\r\ngreatest necessity to maintain the utmost possible speed.\r\n\r\nThe nights continued lovely; the chilled condition of the atmosphere\r\nprevented the formation of clouds; the constellations gleamed forth\r\nwith unsullied luster; and, much as Lieutenant Procope, from nautical\r\nconsiderations, might regret the absence of the moon, he could not do\r\notherwise than own that the magnificent nights of Gallia were such as\r\nmust awaken the enthusiasm of an astronomer. And, as if to compensate\r\nfor the loss of the moonlight, the heavens were illuminated by a\r\nsuperb shower of falling stars, far exceeding, both in number and in\r\nbrilliancy, the phenomena which are commonly distinguished as the August\r\nand November meteors; in fact, Gallia was passing through that meteoric\r\nring which is known to lie exterior to the earth’s orbit, but almost\r\nconcentric with it. The rocky coast, its metallic surface reflecting the\r\nglow of the dazzling luminaries, appeared literally stippled with light,\r\nwhilst the sea, as though spattered with burning hailstones, shone with\r\na phosphorescence that was perfectly splendid. So great, however, was\r\nthe speed at which Gallia was receding from the sun, that this meteoric\r\nstorm lasted scarcely more than four and twenty hours.\r\n\r\nNext day the direct progress of the _Dobryna_ was arrested by a long\r\nprojection of land, which obliged her to turn southwards, until she\r\nreached what formerly would have been the southern extremity of Corsica.\r\nOf this, however, there was now no trace; the Strait of Bonifacio had\r\nbeen replaced by a vast expanse of water, which had at first all the\r\nappearance of being utterly desert; but on the following morning the\r\nexplorers unexpectedly sighted a little island, which, unless it should\r\nprove, as was only too likely, to be of recent origin they concluded,\r\nfrom its situation, must be a portion of the northernmost territory of\r\nSardinia.\r\n\r\nThe _Dobryna_ approached the land as nearly as was prudent, the boat was\r\nlowered, and in a few minutes the count and Servadac had landed upon\r\nthe islet, which was a mere plot of meadow land, not much more than\r\ntwo acres in extent, dotted here and there with a few myrtle-bushes and\r\nlentisks, interspersed with some ancient olives. Having ascertained, as\r\nthey imagined, that the spot was devoid of living creature, they were on\r\nthe point of returning to their boat, when their attention was arrested\r\nby a faint bleating, and immediately afterwards a solitary she-goat came\r\nbounding towards the shore. The creature had dark, almost black hair,\r\nand small curved horns, and was a specimen of that domestic breed which,\r\nwith considerable justice, has gained for itself the title of “the poor\r\nman’s cow.” So far from being alarmed at the presence of strangers, the\r\ngoat ran nimbly towards them, and then, by its movements and plaintive\r\ncries, seemed to be enticing them to follow it.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Servadac; “let us see where it will lead us; it is more\r\nthan probable it is not alone.”\r\n\r\nThe count agreed; and the animal, as if comprehending what was said,\r\ntrotted on gently for about a hundred paces, and stopped in front of a\r\nkind of cave or burrow that was half concealed by a grove of lentisks.\r\nHere a little girl, seven or eight years of age, with rich brown hair\r\nand lustrous dark eyes, beautiful as one of Murillo’s angels, was\r\npeeping shyly through the branches. Apparently discovering nothing\r\nin the aspect of the strangers to excite her apprehensions, the child\r\nsuddenly gained confidence, darted forwards with outstretched hands, and\r\nin a voice, soft and melodious as the language which she spoke, said in\r\nItalian:\r\n\r\n“I like you; you will not hurt me, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Hurt you, my child?” answered Servadac. “No, indeed; we will be your\r\nfriends; we will take care of you.”\r\n\r\nAnd after a few moments’ scrutiny of the pretty maiden, he added:\r\n\r\n“Tell us your name, little one.”\r\n\r\n“Nina!” was the child’s reply.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Nina, can you tell us where we are?”\r\n\r\n“At Madalena, I think,” said the little girl; “at least, I know I was\r\nthere when that dreadful shock came and altered everything.”\r\n\r\nThe count knew that Madalena was close to Caprera, to the north of\r\nSardinia, which had entirely disappeared in the disaster. By dint of a\r\nseries of questions, he gained from the child a very intelligent account\r\nof her experiences. She told him that she had no parents, and had been\r\nemployed in taking care of a flock of goats belonging to one of the\r\nlandowners, when one day, all of a sudden, everything around her, except\r\nthis little piece of land, had been swallowed up, and that she and\r\nMarzy, her pet goat, had been left quite alone. She went on to say that\r\nat first she had been very frightened; but when she found that the earth\r\ndid not shake any more, she had thanked the great God, and had soon made\r\nherself very happy living with Marzy. She had enough food, she said, and\r\nhad been waiting for a boat to fetch her, and now a boat had come and\r\nshe was quite ready to go away; only they must let her goat go with her:\r\nthey would both like so much to get back to the old farm.\r\n\r\n“Here, at least, is one nice little inhabitant of Gallia,” said Captain\r\nServadac, as he caressed the child and conducted her to the boat.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, both Nina and Marzy were safely quartered on board\r\nthe yacht. It is needless to say that they received the heartiest of\r\nwelcomes. The Russian sailors, ever superstitious, seemed almost to\r\nregard the coming of the child as the appearance of an angel; and,\r\nincredible as it may seem, more than one of them wondered whether she\r\nhad wings, and amongst themselves they commonly referred to her as “the\r\nlittle Madonna.”\r\n\r\nSoon out of sight of Madalena, the _Dobryna_ for some hours held a\r\nsoutheasterly course along the shore, which here was fifty leagues in\r\nadvance of the former coast-line of Italy, demonstrating that a new\r\ncontinent must have been formed, substituted as it were for the old\r\npeninsula, of which not a vestige could be identified. At a latitude\r\ncorresponding with the latitude of Rome, the sea took the form of a deep\r\ngulf, extending back far beyond the site of the Eternal City; the\r\ncoast making a wide sweep round to the former position of Calabria, and\r\njutting far beyond the outline of “the boot,” which Italy resembles.\r\nBut the beacon of Messina was not to be discerned; no trace, indeed,\r\nsurvived of any portion of Sicily; the very peak of Etna, 11,000 feet as\r\nit had reared itself above the level of the sea, had vanished utterly.\r\n\r\nAnother sixty leagues to the south, and the _Dobryna_ sighted the\r\nentrance of the strait which had afforded her so providential a refuge\r\nfrom the tempest, and had conducted her to the fragmentary relic of\r\nGibraltar. Hence to the Gulf of Cabes had been already explored, and as\r\nit was universally allowed that it was unnecessary to renew the search\r\nin that direction, the lieutenant started off in a transverse course,\r\ntowards a point hitherto uninvestigated. That point was reached on the\r\n3rd of March, and thence the coast was continuously followed, as it led\r\nthrough what had been Tunis, across the province of Constantine, away\r\nto the oasis of Ziban; where, taking a sharp turn, it first reached a\r\nlatitude of 32 degrees, and then returned again, thus forming a sort\r\nof irregular gulf, enclosed by the same unvarying border of mineral\r\nconcrete. This colossal boundary then stretched away for nearly 150\r\nleagues over the Sahara desert, and, extending to the south of Gourbi\r\nIsland, occupied what, if Morocco had still existed, would have been its\r\nnatural frontier.\r\n\r\nAdapting her course to these deviations of the coastline, the _Dobryna_\r\nwas steering northwards, and had barely reached the limit of the bay,\r\nwhen the attention of all on board was arrested by the phenomenon of a\r\nvolcano, at least 3,000 feet high, its crater crowned with smoke, which\r\noccasionally was streaked by tongues of flame.\r\n\r\n“A burning mountain!” they exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Gallia, then, has some internal heat,” said Servadac.\r\n\r\n“And why not, captain?” rejoined the lieutenant. “If our asteroid has\r\ncarried with it a portion of the old earth’s atmosphere, why should it\r\nnot likewise retain something of its central fire?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well!” said the captain, shrugging his shoulders, “I dare say\r\nthere is caloric enough in our little world to supply the wants of its\r\npopulation.”\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff interrupted the silence that followed this conversation\r\nby saying, “And now, gentlemen, as our course has brought us on our\r\nway once more towards Gibraltar, what do you say to our renewing our\r\nacquaintance with the Englishmen? They will be interested in the result\r\nof our voyage.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Servadac, “I have no desire that way. They know\r\nwhere to find Gourbi Island; they can betake themselves thither just\r\nwhen they please. They have plenty of provisions. If the water freezes,\r\n120 leagues is no very great distance. The reception they gave us was\r\nnot so cordial that we need put ourselves out of the way to repeat our\r\nvisit.”\r\n\r\n“What you say is too true,” replied the count. “I hope we shall show\r\nthem better manners when they condescend to visit us.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Servadac, “we must remember that we are all one people now;\r\nno longer Russian, French, or English. Nationality is extinct.”\r\n\r\n“I am sadly afraid, however,” continued the count, “that an Englishman\r\nwill be an Englishman ever.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the captain, “that is always their failing.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus all further thought of making their way again to the little\r\ngarrison of Gibraltar was abandoned.\r\n\r\nBut even if their spirit of courtesy had disposed them to renew their\r\nacquaintance with the British officers, there were two circumstances\r\nthat just then would have rendered such a proposal very unadvisable. In\r\nthe first place, Lieutenant Procope was convinced that it could not be\r\nmuch longer now before the sea would be entirely frozen; and, besides\r\nthis, the consumption of their coal, through the speed they had\r\nmaintained, had been so great that there was only too much reason\r\nto fear that fuel would fail them. Anyhow, the strictest economy was\r\nnecessary, and it was accordingly resolved that the voyage should not be\r\nmuch prolonged. Beyond the volcanic peak, moreover, the waters seemed to\r\nexpand into a boundless ocean, and it might be a thing full of risk to\r\nbe frozen up while the yacht was so inadequately provisioned. Taking\r\nall these things into account, it was agreed that further investigations\r\nshould be deferred to a more favorable season, and that, without delay,\r\nthe _Dobryna_ should return to Gourbi Island.\r\n\r\nThis decision was especially welcome to Hector Servadac, who, throughout\r\nthe whole of the last five weeks, had been agitated by much anxious\r\nthought on account of the faithful servant he had left behind.\r\n\r\nThe transit from the volcano to the island was not long, and was marked\r\nby only one noticeable incident. This was the finding of a second\r\nmysterious document, in character precisely similar to what they had\r\nfound before. The writer of it was evidently engaged upon a calculation,\r\nprobably continued from day to day, as to the motions of the planet\r\nGallia upon its orbit, and committing the results of his reckonings to\r\nthe waves as the channel of communication.\r\n\r\nInstead of being enclosed in a telescope-case, it was this time secured\r\nin a preserved-meat tin, hermetically sealed, and stamped with the same\r\ninitials on the wax that fastened it. The greatest care was used in\r\nopening it, and it was found to contain the following message:\r\n\r\n\r\n“Gallia Ab sole, au 1 mars, dist. 78,000,000 l.! Chemin parcouru de fev.\r\na mars: 59,000,000 1.! _Va bene! All right! Nil desperandum!_\r\n\r\n“Enchante!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Another enigma!” exclaimed Servadac; “and still no intelligible\r\nsignature, and no address. No clearing up of the mystery!”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt, in my own mind,” said the count, “that it is one of a\r\nseries. It seems to me probable that they are being sent broadcast upon\r\nthe sea.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder where the hare-brained _savant_ that writes them can be\r\nliving?” observed Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Very likely he may have met with the fate of AEsop’s abstracted\r\nastronomer, who found himself at the bottom of a well.”\r\n\r\n“Ay; but where _is_ that well?” demanded the captain.\r\n\r\nThis was a question which the count was incapable of settling; and they\r\ncould only speculate afresh as to whether the author of the riddles was\r\ndwelling upon some solitary island, or, like themselves, was navigating\r\nthe waters of the new Mediterranean. But they could detect nothing to\r\nguide them to a definite decision.\r\n\r\nAfter thoughtfully regarding the document for some time. Lieutenant\r\nProcope proceeded to observe that he believed the paper might be\r\nconsidered as genuine, and accordingly, taking its statements as\r\nreliable, he deduced two important conclusions: first, that whereas,\r\nin the month of January, the distance traveled by the planet\r\n(hypothetically called Gallia) had been recorded as 82,000,000 leagues,\r\nthe distance traveled in February was only 59,000,000 leagues--a\r\ndifference of 23,000,000 leagues in one month; secondly, that the\r\ndistance of the planet from the sun, which on the 15th of February had\r\nbeen 59,000,000 leagues, was on the 1st of March 78,000,000 leagues--an\r\nincrease of 19,000,000 leagues in a fortnight. Thus, in proportion as\r\nGallia receded from the sun, so did the rate of speed diminish by which\r\nshe traveled along her orbit; facts to be observed in perfect conformity\r\nwith the known laws of celestial mechanism.\r\n\r\n“And your inference?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n“My inference,” replied the lieutenant, “is a confirmation of my surmise\r\nthat we are following an orbit decidedly elliptical, although we have\r\nnot yet the material to determine its eccentricity.”\r\n\r\n“As the writer adheres to the appellation of Gallia, do you not think,”\r\n asked the count, “that we might call these new waters the Gallian Sea?”\r\n\r\n“There can be no reason to the contrary, count,” replied the lieutenant;\r\n“and as such I will insert it upon my new chart.”\r\n\r\n“Our friend,” said Servadac, “seems to be more and more gratified\r\nwith the condition of things; not only has he adopted our motto, ‘_Nil\r\ndesperandum!_’ but see how enthusiastically he has wound up with his\r\n‘_Enchante!_’”\r\n\r\nThe conversation dropped.\r\n\r\nA few hours later the man on watch announced that Gourbi Island was in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. AN UNEXPECTED POPULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Dobryna_ was now back again at the island. Her cruise had lasted\r\nfrom the 31st of January to the 5th of March, a period of thirty-five\r\ndays (for it was leap year), corresponding to seventy days as\r\naccomplished by the new little world.\r\n\r\nMany a time during his absence Hector Servadac had wondered how his\r\npresent vicissitudes would end, and he had felt some misgivings as\r\nto whether he should ever again set foot upon the island, and see\r\nhis faithful orderly, so that it was not without emotion that he had\r\napproached the coast of the sole remaining fragment of Algerian soil.\r\nBut his apprehensions were groundless; Gourbi Island was just as he had\r\nleft it, with nothing unusual in its aspect, except that a very peculiar\r\ncloud was hovering over it, at an altitude of little more than a hundred\r\nfeet. As the yacht approached the shore, this cloud appeared to rise and\r\nfall as if acted upon by some invisible agency, and the captain, after\r\nwatching it carefully, perceived that it was not an accumulation of\r\nvapors at all, but a dense mass of birds packed as closely together as\r\na swarm of herrings, and uttering deafening and discordant cries,\r\namidst which from time to time the noise of the report of a gun could be\r\nplainly distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe _Dobryna_ signalized her arrival by firing her cannon, and dropped\r\nanchor in the little port of the Shelif. Almost within a minute Ben Zoof\r\nwas seen running, gun in hand, towards the shore; he cleared the last\r\nridge of rocks at a single bound, and then suddenly halted. For a\r\nfew seconds he stood motionless, his eyes fixed, as if obeying the\r\ninstructions of a drill sergeant, on a point some fifteen yards distant,\r\nhis whole attitude indicating submission and respect; but the sight\r\nof the captain, who was landing, was too much for his equanimity, and\r\ndarting forward, he seized his master’s hand and covered it with kisses.\r\nInstead, however, of uttering any expressions of welcome or rejoicing\r\nat the captain’s return, Ben Zoof broke out into the most vehement\r\nejaculations.\r\n\r\n“Thieves, captain! beastly thieves! Bedouins! pirates! devils!”\r\n\r\n“Why, Ben Zoof, what’s the matter?” said Servadac soothingly.\r\n\r\n“They are thieves! downright, desperate thieves! those infernal birds!\r\nThat’s what’s the matter. It is a good thing you have come. Here have\r\nI for a whole month been spending my powder and shot upon them, and the\r\nmore I kill them, the worse they get; and yet, if I were to leave them\r\nalone, we should not have a grain of corn upon the island.”\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident that the orderly had only too much cause for alarm.\r\nThe crops had ripened rapidly during the excessive heat of January, when\r\nthe orbit of Gallia was being traversed at its perihelion, and were now\r\nexposed to the depredations of many thousands of birds; and although\r\na goodly number of stacks attested the industry of Ben Zoof during\r\nthe time of the _Dobryna_‘s voyage, it was only too apparent that the\r\nportion of the harvest that remained ungathered was liable to the most\r\nimminent risk of being utterly devoured. It was, perhaps, only natural\r\nthat this clustered mass of birds, as representing the whole of the\r\nfeathered tribe upon the surface of Gallia, should resort to Gourbi\r\nIsland, of which the meadows seemed to be the only spot from which they\r\ncould get sustenance at all; but as this sustenance would be obtained\r\nat the expense, and probably to the serious detriment, of the human\r\npopulation, it was absolutely necessary that every possible resistance\r\nshould be made to the devastation that was threatened.\r\n\r\nOnce satisfied that Servadac and his friends would cooperate with him in\r\nthe raid upon “the thieves,” Ben Zoof became calm and content, and began\r\nto make various inquiries. “And what has become,” he said, “of all our\r\nold comrades in Africa?”\r\n\r\n“As far as I can tell you,” answered the captain, “they are all in\r\nAfrica still; only Africa isn’t by any means where we expected to find\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“And France? Montmartre?” continued Ben Zoof eagerly. Here was the cry\r\nof the poor fellow’s heart.\r\n\r\nAs briefly as he could, Servadac endeavored to explain the true\r\ncondition of things; he tried to communicate the fact that Paris,\r\nFrance, Europe, nay, the whole world was more than eighty millions of\r\nleagues away from Gourbi Island; as gently and cautiously as he could\r\nhe expressed his fear that they might never see Europe, France, Paris,\r\nMontmartre again.\r\n\r\n“No, no, sir!” protested Ben Zoof emphatically; “that is all nonsense.\r\nIt is altogether out of the question to suppose that we are not to see\r\nMontmartre again.” And the orderly shook his head resolutely, with the\r\nair of a man determined, in spite of argument, to adhere to his own\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n“Very good, my brave fellow,” replied Servadac, “hope on, hope while you\r\nmay. The message has come to us over the sea, ‘Never despair’; but one\r\nthing, nevertheless, is certain; we must forthwith commence arrangements\r\nfor making this island our permanent home.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac now led the way to the gourbi, which, by his servant’s\r\nexertions, had been entirely rebuilt; and here he did the honors of his\r\nmodest establishment to his two guests, the count and the lieutenant,\r\nand gave a welcome, too, to little Nina, who had accompanied them on\r\nshore, and between whom and Ben Zoof the most friendly relations had\r\nalready been established.\r\n\r\nThe adjacent building continued in good preservation, and Captain\r\nServadac’s satisfaction was very great in finding the two horses, Zephyr\r\nand Galette, comfortably housed there and in good condition.\r\n\r\nAfter the enjoyment of some refreshment, the party proceeded to a\r\ngeneral consultation as to what steps must be taken for their future\r\nwelfare. The most pressing matter that came before them was the\r\nconsideration of the means to be adopted to enable the inhabitants of\r\nGallia to survive the terrible cold, which, in their ignorance of the\r\ntrue eccentricity of their orbit, might, for aught they knew, last for\r\nan almost indefinite period. Fuel was far from abundant; of coal there\r\nwas none; trees and shrubs were few in number, and to cut them down in\r\nprospect of the cold seemed a very questionable policy; but there was\r\nno doubt some expedient must be devised to prevent disaster, and that\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nThe victualing of the little colony offered no immediate difficulty.\r\nWater was abundant, and the cisterns could hardly fail to be replenished\r\nby the numerous streams that meandered along the plains; moreover, the\r\nGallian Sea would ere long be frozen over, and the melted ice (water\r\nin its congealed state being divested of every particle of salt) would\r\nafford a supply of drink that could not be exhausted. The crops that\r\nwere now ready for the harvest, and the flocks and herds scattered over\r\nthe island, would form an ample reserve. There was little doubt that\r\nthroughout the winter the soil would remain unproductive, and no fresh\r\nfodder for domestic animals could then be obtained; it would therefore\r\nbe necessary, if the exact duration of Gallia’s year should ever be\r\ncalculated, to proportion the number of animals to be reserved to the\r\nreal length of the winter.\r\n\r\nThe next thing requisite was to arrive at a true estimate of the\r\nnumber of the population. Without including the thirteen Englishmen at\r\nGibraltar, about whom he was not particularly disposed to give himself\r\nmuch concern at present, Servadac put down the names of the eight\r\nRussians, the two Frenchman, and the little Italian girl, eleven in all,\r\nas the entire list of the inhabitants of Gourbi Island.\r\n\r\n“Oh, pardon me,” interposed Ben Zoof, “you are mistaking the state of\r\nthe case altogether. You will be surprised to learn that the total of\r\npeople on the island is double that. It is twenty-two.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-two!” exclaimed the captain; “twenty-two people on this island?\r\nWhat do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“The opportunity has not occurred,” answered Ben Zoof, “for me to tell\r\nyou before, but I have had company.”\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself, Ben Zoof,” said Servadac. “What company have you\r\nhad?”\r\n\r\n“You could not suppose,” replied the orderly, “that my own unassisted\r\nhands could have accomplished all that harvest work that you see has\r\nbeen done.”\r\n\r\n“I confess,” said Lieutenant Procope, “we do not seem to have noticed\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Ben Zoof, “if you will be good enough to come with me\r\nfor about a mile, I shall be able to show you my companions. But we must\r\ntake our guns.”\r\n\r\n“Why take our guns?” asked Servadac. “I hope we are not going to fight.”\r\n\r\n“No, not with men,” said Ben Zoof; “but it does not answer to throw a\r\nchance away for giving battle to those thieves of birds.”\r\n\r\nLeaving little Nina and her goat in the gourbi, Servadac, Count\r\nTimascheff, and the lieutenant, greatly mystified, took up their guns\r\nand followed the orderly. All along their way they made unsparing\r\nslaughter of the birds that hovered over and around them. Nearly every\r\nspecies of the feathered tribe seemed to have its representative in that\r\nliving cloud. There were wild ducks in thousands; snipe, larks, rooks,\r\nand swallows; a countless variety of sea-birds--widgeons, gulls, and\r\nseamews; beside a quantity of game--quails, partridges, and woodcocks.\r\nThe sportsmen did their best; every shot told; and the depredators fell\r\nby dozens on either hand.\r\n\r\nInstead of following the northern shore of the island, Ben Zoof cut\r\nobliquely across the plain. Making their progress with the unwonted\r\nrapidity which was attributable to their specific lightness, Servadac\r\nand his companions soon found themselves near a grove of sycamores and\r\neucalyptus massed in picturesque confusion at the base of a little hill.\r\nHere they halted.\r\n\r\n“Ah! the vagabonds! the rascals! the thieves!” suddenly exclaimed Ben\r\nZoof, stamping his foot with rage.\r\n\r\n“How now? Are your friends the birds at their pranks again?” asked the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t mean the birds: I mean those lazy beggars that are shirking\r\ntheir work. Look here; look there!” And as Ben Zoof spoke, he pointed\r\nto some scythes, and sickles, and other implements of husbandry that had\r\nbeen left upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“What is it you mean?” asked Servadac, getting somewhat impatient.\r\n\r\n“Hush, hush! listen!” was all Ben Zoof’s reply; and he raised his finger\r\nas if in warning.\r\n\r\nListening attentively, Servadac and his associates could distinctly\r\nrecognize a human voice, accompanied by the notes of a guitar and by the\r\nmeasured click of castanets.\r\n\r\n“Spaniards!” said Servadac.\r\n\r\n“No mistake about that, sir,” replied Ben Zoof; “a Spaniard would rattle\r\nhis castanets at the cannon’s mouth.”\r\n\r\n“But what is the meaning of it all?” asked the captain, more puzzled\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n“Hark!” said Ben Zoof; “it is the old man’s turn.”\r\n\r\nAnd then a voice, at once gruff and harsh, was heard vociferating, “My\r\nmoney! my money! when will you pay me my money? Pay me what you owe me,\r\nyou miserable majos.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the song continued:\r\n\r\n               _“Tu sandunga y cigarro,\r\n               Y una cana de Jerez,\r\n               Mi jamelgo y un trabuco,\r\n               Que mas gloria puede haver?”_\r\n\r\nServadac’s knowledge of Gascon enabled him partially to comprehend the\r\nrollicking tenor of the Spanish patriotic air, but his attention was\r\nagain arrested by the voice of the old man growling savagely, “Pay me\r\nyou shall; yes, by the God of Abraham, you shall pay me.”\r\n\r\n“A Jew!” exclaimed Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Ay, sir, a German Jew,” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\nThe party was on the point of entering the thicket, when a singular\r\nspectacle made them pause. A group of Spaniards had just begun dancing\r\ntheir national fandango, and the extraordinary lightness which had\r\nbecome the physical property of every object in the new planet made\r\nthe dancers bound to a height of thirty feet or more into the air,\r\nconsiderably above the tops of the trees. What followed was irresistibly\r\ncomic. Four sturdy majos had dragged along with them an old man\r\nincapable of resistance, and compelled him, _nolens volens_, to join\r\nin the dance; and as they all kept appearing and disappearing above the\r\nbank of foliage, their grotesque attitudes, combined with the pitiable\r\ncountenance of their helpless victim, could not do otherwise than recall\r\nmost forcibly the story of Sancho Panza tossed in a blanket by the merry\r\ndrapers of Segovia.\r\n\r\nServadac, the count, Procope, and Ben Zoof now proceeded to make their\r\nway through the thicket until they came to a little glade, where two men\r\nwere stretched idly on the grass, one of them playing the guitar, and\r\nthe other a pair of castanets; both were exploding with laughter, as\r\nthey urged the performers to greater and yet greater exertions in\r\nthe dance. At the sight of strangers they paused in their music, and\r\nsimultaneously the dancers, with their victim, alighted gently on the\r\nsward.\r\n\r\nBreathless and half exhausted as was the Jew, he rushed with an effort\r\ntowards Servadac, and exclaimed in French, marked by a strong Teutonic\r\naccent, “Oh, my lord governor, help me, help! These rascals defraud me\r\nof my rights; they rob me; but, in the name of the God of Israel, I ask\r\nyou to see justice done!”\r\n\r\nThe captain glanced inquiringly towards Ben Zoof, and the orderly, by a\r\nsignificant nod, made his master understand that he was to play the part\r\nthat was implied by the title. He took the cue, and promptly ordered\r\nthe Jew to hold his tongue at once. The man bowed his head in servile\r\nsubmission, and folded his hands upon his breast.\r\n\r\nServadac surveyed him leisurely. He was a man of about fifty, but from\r\nhis appearance might well have been taken for at least ten years older.\r\nSmall and skinny, with eyes bright and cunning, a hooked nose, a short\r\nyellow beard, unkempt hair, huge feet, and long bony hands, he presented\r\nall the typical characteristics of the German Jew, the heartless, wily\r\nusurer, the hardened miser and skinflint. As iron is attracted by the\r\nmagnet, so was this Shylock attracted by the sight of gold, nor would he\r\nhave hesitated to draw the life-blood of his creditors, if by such means\r\nhe could secure his claims.\r\n\r\nHis name was Isaac Hakkabut, and he was a native of Cologne. Nearly the\r\nwhole of his time, however, he informed Captain Servadac, had been spent\r\nupon the sea, his real business being that of a merchant trading at all\r\nthe ports of the Mediterranean. A tartan, a small vessel of two hundred\r\ntons burden, conveyed his entire stock of merchandise, and, to say the\r\ntruth, was a sort of floating emporium, conveying nearly every possible\r\narticle of commerce, from a lucifer match to the radiant fabrics of\r\nFrankfort and Epinal. Without wife or children, and having no settled\r\nhome, Isaac Hakkabut lived almost entirely on board the _Hansa_, as he\r\nhad named his tartan; and engaging a mate, with a crew of three men, as\r\nbeing adequate to work so light a craft, he cruised along the coasts of\r\nAlgeria, Tunis, Egypt, Turkey, and Greece, visiting, moreover, most of\r\nthe harbors of the Levant. Careful to be always well supplied with the\r\nproducts in most general demand--coffee, sugar, rice, tobacco, cotton\r\nstuffs, and gunpowder--and being at all times ready to barter, and\r\nprepared to deal in secondhand wares, he had contrived to amass\r\nconsiderable wealth.\r\n\r\nOn the eventful night of the 1st of January the _Hansa_ had been at\r\nCeuta, the point on the coast of Morocco exactly opposite Gibraltar. The\r\nmate and three sailors had all gone on shore, and, in common with\r\nmany of their fellow-creatures, had entirely disappeared; but the\r\nmost projecting rock of Ceuta had been undisturbed by the general\r\ncatastrophe, and half a score of Spaniards, who had happened to be\r\nupon it, had escaped with their lives. They were all Andalusian majos,\r\nagricultural laborers, and naturally as careless and apathetic as men of\r\ntheir class usually are, but they could not help being very considerably\r\nembarrassed when they discovered that they were left in solitude upon\r\na detached and isolated rock. They took what mutual counsel they could,\r\nbut became only more and more perplexed. One of them was named Negrete,\r\nand he, as having traveled somewhat more than the rest, was tacitly\r\nrecognized as a sort of leader; but although he was by far the most\r\nenlightened of them all, he was quite incapable of forming the least\r\nconception of the nature of what had occurred. The one thing upon which\r\nthey could not fail to be conscious was that they had no prospect of\r\nobtaining provisions, and consequently their first business was to\r\ndevise a scheme for getting away from their present abode. The _Hansa_\r\nwas lying off shore. The Spaniards would not have had the slightest\r\nhesitation in summarily taking possession of her, but their utter\r\nignorance of seamanship made them reluctantly come to the conclusion\r\nthat the more prudent policy was to make terms with the owner.\r\n\r\nAnd now came a singular part of the story. Negrete and his companions\r\nhad meanwhile received a visit from two English officers from Gibraltar.\r\nWhat passed between them the Jew did not know; he only knew that,\r\nimmediately after the conclusion of the interview, Negrete came to him\r\nand ordered him to set sail at once for the nearest point of Morocco.\r\nThe Jew, afraid to disobey, but with his eye ever upon the main chance,\r\nstipulated that at the end of their voyage the Spaniards should pay for\r\ntheir passage--terms to which, as they would to any other, they did not\r\ndemur, knowing that they had not the slightest intention of giving him a\r\nsingle real.\r\n\r\nThe _Hansa_ had weighed anchor on the 3rd of February. The wind blew\r\nfrom the west, and consequently the working of the tartan was easy\r\nenough. The unpracticed sailors had only to hoist their sails and,\r\nthough they were quite unconscious of the fact, the breeze carried them\r\nto the only spot upon the little world they occupied which could afford\r\nthem a refuge.\r\n\r\nThus it fell out that one morning Ben Zoof, from his lookout on Gourbi\r\nIsland, saw a ship, not the _Dobryna_, appear upon the horizon, and\r\nmake quietly down towards what had formerly been the right bank of the\r\nShelif.\r\n\r\nSuch was Ben Zoof’s version of what had occurred, as he had gathered it\r\nfrom the new-comers. He wound up his recital by remarking that the cargo\r\nof the _Hansa_ would be of immense service to them; he expected, indeed,\r\nthat Isaac Hakkabut would be difficult to manage, but considered there\r\ncould be no harm in appropriating the goods for the common welfare,\r\nsince there could be no opportunity now for selling them.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof added, “And as to the difficulties between the Jew and his\r\npassengers, I told him that the governor general was absent on a tour of\r\ninspection, and that he would see everything equitably settled.”\r\n\r\nSmiling at his orderly’s tactics, Servadac turned to Hakkabut, and told\r\nhim that he would take care that his claims should be duly investigated\r\nand all proper demands should be paid. The man appeared satisfied, and,\r\nfor the time at least, desisted from his complaints and importunities.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jew had retired, Count Timascheff asked, “But how in the world\r\ncan you ever make those fellows pay anything?”\r\n\r\n“They have lots of money,” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“Not likely,” replied the count; “when did you ever know Spaniards like\r\nthem to have lots of money?”\r\n\r\n“But I have seen it myself,” said Ben Zoof; “and it is English money.”\r\n\r\n“English money!” echoed Servadac; and his mind again reverted to the\r\nexcursion made by the colonel and the major from Gibraltar, about which\r\nthey had been so reticent. “We must inquire more about this,” he said.\r\n\r\nThen, addressing Count Timascheff, he added, “Altogether, I think the\r\ncountries of Europe are fairly represented by the population of Gallia.”\r\n\r\n“True, captain,” answered the count; “we have only a fragment of a\r\nworld, but it contains natives of France, Russia, Italy, Spain, and\r\nEngland. Even Germany may be said to have a representative in the person\r\nof this miserable Jew.”\r\n\r\n“And even in him,” said Servadac, “perhaps we shall not find so\r\nindifferent a representative as we at present imagine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. GALLIA’S GOVERNOR GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards who had arrived on board the _Hansa_ consisted of nine men\r\nand a lad of twelve years of age, named Pablo. They all received Captain\r\nServadac, whom Ben Zoof introduced as the governor general, with due\r\nrespect, and returned quickly to their separate tasks. The captain and\r\nhis friends, followed at some distance by the eager Jew, soon left the\r\nglade and directed their steps towards the coast where the _Hansa_ was\r\nmoored.\r\n\r\nAs they went they discussed their situation. As far as they had\r\nascertained, except Gourbi Island, the sole surviving fragments of the\r\nOld World were four small islands: the bit of Gibraltar occupied by the\r\nEnglishmen; Ceuta, which had just been left by the Spaniards; Madalena,\r\nwhere they had picked up the little Italian girl; and the site of\r\nthe tomb of Saint Louis on the coast of Tunis. Around these there was\r\nstretched out the full extent of the Gallian Sea, which apparently\r\ncomprised about one-half of the Mediterranean, the whole being\r\nencompassed by a barrier like a framework of precipitous cliffs, of an\r\norigin and a substance alike unknown.\r\n\r\nOf all these spots only two were known to be inhabited: Gibraltar, where\r\nthe thirteen Englishmen were amply provisioned for some years to come,\r\nand their own Gourbi Island. Here there was a population of twenty-two,\r\nwho would all have to subsist upon the natural products of the soil.\r\nIt was indeed not to be forgotten that, perchance, upon some remote and\r\nundiscovered isle there might be the solitary writer of the mysterious\r\npapers which they had found, and if so, that would raise the census of\r\ntheir new asteroid to an aggregate of thirty-six.\r\n\r\nEven upon the supposition that at some future date the whole population\r\nshould be compelled to unite and find a residence upon Gourbi Island,\r\nthere did not appear any reason to question but that eight hundred\r\nacres of rich soil, under good management, would yield them all an ample\r\nsustenance. The only critical matter was how long the cold season would\r\nlast; every hope depended upon the land again becoming productive; at\r\npresent, it seemed impossible to determine, even if Gallia’s orbit\r\nwere really elliptic, when she would reach her aphelion, and it was\r\nconsequently necessary that the Gallians for the time being should\r\nreckon on nothing beyond their actual and present resources.\r\n\r\nThese resources were, first, the provisions of the _Dobryna_, consisting\r\nof preserved meat, sugar, wine, brandy, and other stores sufficient for\r\nabout two months; secondly, the valuable cargo of the _Hansa_, which,\r\nsooner or later, the owner, whether he would or not, must be compelled\r\nto surrender for the common benefit; and lastly, the produce of the\r\nisland, animal and vegetable, which with proper economy might be made to\r\nlast for a considerable period.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the conversation, Count Timascheff took an opportunity\r\nof saying that, as Captain Servadac had already been presented to the\r\nSpaniards as governor of the island, he thought it advisable that he\r\nshould really assume that position.\r\n\r\n“Every body of men,” he observed, “must have a head, and you, as a\r\nFrenchman, should, I think, take the command of this fragment of a\r\nFrench colony. My men, I can answer for it, are quite prepared to\r\nrecognize you as their superior officer.”\r\n\r\n“Most unhesitatingly,” replied Servadac, “I accept the post with all its\r\nresponsibilities. We understand each other so well that I feel sure we\r\nshall try and work together for the common good; and even if it be our\r\nfate never again to behold our fellow creatures, I have no misgivings\r\nbut that we shall be able to cope with whatever difficulties may be\r\nbefore us.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he held out his hand. The count took it, at the same time\r\nmaking a slight bow. It was the first time since their meeting that the\r\ntwo men had shaken hands; on the other hand, not a single word about\r\ntheir former rivalry had ever escaped their lips; perhaps that was all\r\nforgotten now.\r\n\r\nThe silence of a few moments was broken by Servadac saying, “Do you not\r\nthink we ought to explain our situation to the Spaniards?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, your Excellency,” burst in Ben Zoof, emphatically; “the fellows\r\nare chicken-hearted enough already; only tell them what has happened,\r\nand in sheer despondency they will not do another stroke of work.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” said Lieutenant Procope, who took very much the same view\r\nas the orderly, “they are so miserably ignorant they would be sure to\r\nmisunderstand you.”\r\n\r\n“Understand or misunderstand,” replied Servadac, “I do not think it\r\nmatters. They would not care. They are all fatalists. Only give them\r\na guitar and their castanets, and they will soon forget all care and\r\nanxiety. For my own part, I must adhere to my belief that it will\r\nbe advisable to tell them everything. Have you any opinion to offer,\r\ncount?”\r\n\r\n“My own opinion, captain, coincides entirely with yours. I have followed\r\nthe plan of explaining all I could to my men on board the _Dobryna_, and\r\nno inconvenience has arisen.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, so let it be,” said the captain; adding, “It is not likely\r\nthat these Spaniards are so ignorant as not to have noticed the change\r\nin the length of the days; neither can they be unaware of the physical\r\nchanges that have transpired. They shall certainly be told that we are\r\nbeing carried away into unknown regions of space, and that this island\r\nis nearly all that remains of the Old World.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha!” laughed Ben Zoof, aloud; “it will be fine sport to watch the\r\nold Jew’s face, when he is made to comprehend that he is flying away\r\nmillions and millions of leagues from all his debtors.”\r\n\r\nIsaac Hakkabut was about fifty yards behind, and was consequently unable\r\nto overhear the conversation. He went shambling along, half whimpering\r\nand not unfrequently invoking the God of Israel; but every now and then\r\na cunning light gleamed from his eyes, and his lips became compressed\r\nwith a grim significance.\r\n\r\nNone of the recent phenomena had escaped his notice, and more than once\r\nhe had attempted to entice Ben Zoof into conversation upon the subject;\r\nbut the orderly made no secret of his antipathy to him, and generally\r\nreplied to his advances either by satire or by banter. He told him that\r\nhe had everything to gain under the new system of nights and days, for,\r\ninstead of living the Jew’s ordinary life of a century, he would\r\nreach to the age of two centuries; and he congratulated him upon the\r\ncircumstance of things having become so light, because it would prevent\r\nhim feeling the burden of his years. At another time he would declare\r\nthat, to an old usurer like him, it could not matter in the least what\r\nhad become of the moon, as he could not possibly have advanced any\r\nmoney upon her. And when Isaac, undaunted by his jeers, persevered in\r\nbesetting him with questions, he tried to silence him by saying, “Only\r\nwait till the governor general comes; he is a shrewd fellow, and will\r\ntell you all about it.”\r\n\r\n“But will he protect my property?” poor Isaac would ask tremulously.\r\n\r\n“To be sure he will! He would confiscate it all rather than that you\r\nshould be robbed of it.”\r\n\r\nWith this Job’s comfort the Jew had been obliged to content himself as\r\nbest he could, and to await the promised arrival of the governor.\r\n\r\nWhen Servadac and his companions reached the shore, they found that the\r\n_Hansa_ had anchored in an exposed bay, protected but barely by a few\r\nprojecting rocks, and in such a position that a gale rising from the\r\nwest would inevitably drive her on to the land, where she must be dashed\r\nin pieces. It would be the height of folly to leave her in her present\r\nmoorings; without loss of time she must be brought round to the mouth of\r\nthe Shelif, in immediate proximity to the Russian yacht.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness that his tartan was the subject of discussion made\r\nthe Jew give way to such vehement ejaculations of anxiety, that Servadac\r\nturned round and peremptorily ordered him to desist from his clamor.\r\nLeaving the old man under the surveillance of the count and Ben Zoof,\r\nthe captain and the lieutenant stepped into a small boat and were soon\r\nalongside the floating emporium.\r\n\r\nA very short inspection sufficed to make them aware that both the tartan\r\nand her cargo were in a perfect state of preservation. In the hold were\r\nsugar-loaves by hundreds, chests of tea, bags of coffee, hogsheads of\r\ntobacco, pipes of wine, casks of brandy, barrels of dried herrings,\r\nbales of cotton, clothing of every kind, shoes of all sizes, caps of\r\nvarious shape, tools, household utensils, china and earthenware, reams\r\nof paper, bottles of ink, boxes of lucifer matches, blocks of salt, bags\r\nof pepper and spices, a stock of huge Dutch cheeses, and a collection of\r\nalmanacs and miscellaneous literature. At a rough guess the value could\r\nnot be much under pounds 5,000 sterling. A new cargo had been taken in\r\nonly a few days before the catastrophe, and it had been Isaac Hakkabut’s\r\nintention to cruise from Ceuta to Tripoli, calling wherever he had\r\nreason to believe there was likely to be a market for any of his\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\n“A fine haul, lieutenant,” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” said the lieutenant; “but what if the owner refuses to\r\npart with it?”\r\n\r\n“No fear; no fear,” replied the captain. “As soon as ever the old rascal\r\nfinds that there are no more Arabs or Algerians for him to fleece, he\r\nwill be ready enough to transact a little business with us. We will pay\r\nhim by bills of acceptance on some of his old friends in the Old World.”\r\n\r\n“But why should he want any payment?” inquired the lieutenant. “Under\r\nthe circumstances, he must know that you have a right to make a\r\nrequisition of his goods.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” quickly rejoined Servadac; “we will not do that. Just because\r\nthe fellow is a German we shall not be justified in treating him in\r\nGerman fashion. We will transact our business in a business way. Only\r\nlet him once realize that he is on a new globe, with no prospect of\r\ngetting back to the old one, and he will be ready enough to come to\r\nterms with us.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right,” replied the lieutenant; “I hope you are. But\r\nanyhow, it will not do to leave the tartan here; not only would she be\r\nin danger in the event of a storm, but it is very questionable whether\r\nshe could resist the pressure of the ice, if the water were to freeze.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true, Procope; and accordingly I give you the commission to see\r\nthat your crew bring her round to the Shelif as soon as may be.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow morning it shall be done,” answered the lieutenant, promptly.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to the shore, it was arranged that the whole of the\r\nlittle colony should forthwith assemble at the gourbi. The Spaniards\r\nwere summoned and Isaac, although he could only with reluctance take his\r\nwistful gaze from his tartan, obeyed the governor’s orders to follow.\r\n\r\nAn hour later and the entire population of twenty-two had met in the\r\nchamber adjoining the gourbi. Young Pablo made his first acquaintance\r\nwith little Nina, and the child seemed highly delighted to find a\r\ncompanion so nearly of her own age. Leaving the children to entertain\r\neach other, Captain Servadac began his address.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon further explanation, he said that he counted upon\r\nthe cordial co-operation of them all for the common welfare.\r\n\r\nNegrete interrupted him by declaring that no promises or pledges could\r\nbe given until he and his countrymen knew how soon they could be sent\r\nback to Spain.\r\n\r\n“To Spain, do you say?” asked Servadac.\r\n\r\n“To Spain!” echoed Isaac Hakkabut, with a hideous yell. “Do they expect\r\nto go back to Spain till they have paid their debts? Your Excellency,\r\nthey owe me twenty reals apiece for their passage here; they owe me two\r\nhundred reals. Are they to be allowed...?”\r\n\r\n“Silence, Mordecai, you fool!” shouted Ben Zoof, who was accustomed\r\nto call the Jew by any Hebrew name that came uppermost to his memory.\r\n“Silence!”\r\n\r\nServadac was disposed to appease the old man’s anxiety by promising\r\nto see that justice was ultimately done; but, in a fever of frantic\r\nexcitement, he went on to implore that he might have the loan of a few\r\nsailors to carry his ship to Algiers.\r\n\r\n“I will pay you honestly; I will pay you _well_,” he cried; but his\r\ningrained propensity for making a good bargain prompted him to add,\r\n“provided you do not overcharge me.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof was about again to interpose some angry exclamation; but\r\nServadac checked him, and continued in Spanish: “Listen to me, my\r\nfriends. Something very strange has happened. A most wonderful event has\r\ncut us off from Spain, from France, from Italy, from every country\r\nof Europe. In fact, we have left the Old World entirely. Of the whole\r\nearth, nothing remains except this island on which you are now taking\r\nrefuge. The old globe is far, far away. Our present abode is but an\r\ninsignificant fragment that is left. I dare not tell you that there is\r\nany chance of your ever again seeing your country or your homes.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. The Spaniards evidently had no conception of his meaning.\r\n\r\nNegrete begged him to tell them all again. He repeated all that he had\r\nsaid, and by introducing some illustrations from familiar things,\r\nhe succeeded to a certain extent in conveying some faint idea of the\r\nconvulsion that had happened. The event was precisely what he had\r\nforetold. The communication was received by all alike with the most\r\nsupreme indifference.\r\n\r\nHakkabut did not say a word. He had listened with manifest attention,\r\nhis lips twitching now and then as if suppressing a smile. Servadac\r\nturned to him, and asked whether he was still disposed to put out to sea\r\nand make for Algiers.\r\n\r\nThe Jew gave a broad grin, which, however, he was careful to conceal\r\nfrom the Spaniards. “Your Excellency jests,” he said in French; and\r\nturning to Count Timascheff, he added in Russian: “The governor has made\r\nup a wonderful tale.”\r\n\r\nThe count turned his back in disgust, while the Jew sidled up to little\r\nNina and muttered in Italian. “A lot of lies, pretty one; a lot of\r\nlies!”\r\n\r\n“Confound the knave!” exclaimed Ben Zoof; “he gabbles every tongue under\r\nthe sun!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Servadac; “but whether he speaks French, Russian, Spanish,\r\nGerman, or Italian, he is neither more nor less than a Jew.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. A LIGHT ON THE HORIZON\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, without giving himself any further concern about\r\nthe Jew’s incredulity, the captain gave orders for the _Hansa_ to be\r\nshifted round to the harbor of the Shelif. Hakkabut raised no objection,\r\nnot only because he was aware that the move insured the immediate safety\r\nof his tartan, but because he was secretly entertaining the hope that\r\nhe might entice away two or three of the _Dobryna’s_ crew and make his\r\nescape to Algiers or some other port.\r\n\r\nOperations now commenced for preparing proper winter quarters. Spaniards\r\nand Russians alike joined heartily in the work, the diminution of\r\natmospheric pressure and of the force of attraction contributing such\r\nan increase to their muscular force as materially facilitated all their\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\nThe first business was to accommodate the building adjacent to the\r\ngourbi to the wants of the little colony. Here for the present the\r\nSpaniards were lodged, the Russians retaining their berths upon the\r\nyacht, while the Jew was permitted to pass his nights upon the _Hansa_.\r\nThis arrangement, however, could be only temporary. The time could not\r\nbe far distant when ships’ sides and ordinary walls would fail to\r\ngive an adequate protection from the severity of the cold that must\r\nbe expected; the stock of fuel was too limited to keep up a permanent\r\nsupply of heat in their present quarters, and consequently they must\r\nbe driven to seek some other refuge, the internal temperature of which\r\nwould at least be bearable.\r\n\r\nThe plan that seemed to commend itself most to their consideration was,\r\nthat they should dig out for themselves some subterraneous pits similar\r\nto “silos,” such as are used as receptacles for grain. They presumed\r\nthat when the surface of Gallia should be covered by a thick layer of\r\nice, which is a bad conductor of heat, a sufficient amount of warmth\r\nfor animal vitality might still be retained in excavations of this kind.\r\nAfter a long consultation they failed to devise any better expedient,\r\nand were forced to resign themselves to this species of troglodyte\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn one respect they congratulated themselves that they should be better\r\noff than many of the whalers in the polar seas, for as it is impossible\r\nto get below the surface of a frozen ocean, these adventurers have to\r\nseek refuge in huts of wood and snow erected on their ships, which at\r\nbest can give but slight protection from extreme cold; but here, with a\r\nsolid subsoil, the Gallians might hope to dig down a hundred feet or so\r\nand secure for themselves a shelter that would enable them to brave the\r\nhardest severity of climate.\r\n\r\nThe order, then, was at once given. The work was commenced. A stock of\r\nshovels, mattocks, and pick-axes was brought from the gourbi, and with\r\nBen Zoof as overseer, both Spanish majos and Russian sailors set to work\r\nwith a will.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before a discovery, more unexpected than\r\nagreeable, suddenly arrested their labors. The spot chosen for the\r\nexcavation was a little to the right of the gourbi, on a slight\r\nelevation of the soil. For the first day everything went on prosperously\r\nenough; but at a depth of eight feet below the surface, the navvies came\r\nin contact with a hard surface, upon which all their tools failed to\r\nmake the slightest impression. Servadac and the count were at once\r\napprised of the fact, and had little difficulty in recognizing the\r\nsubstance that had revealed itself as the very same which composed the\r\nshores as well as the subsoil of the Gallian sea. It evidently formed\r\nthe universal substructure of the new asteroid. Means for hollowing it\r\nfailed them utterly. Harder and more resisting than granite, it could\r\nnot be blasted by ordinary powder; dynamite alone could suffice to rend\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was very great. Unless some means of protection were\r\nspeedily devised, death seemed to be staring them in the face. Were the\r\nfigures in the mysterious documents correct? If so, Gallia must now be\r\na hundred millions of leagues from the sun, nearly three times the\r\ndistance of the earth at the remotest section of her orbit. The\r\nintensity of the solar light and heat, too, was very seriously\r\ndiminishing, although Gourbi Island (being on the equator of an orb\r\nwhich had its axes always perpendicular to the plane in which it\r\nrevolved) enjoyed a position that gave it a permanent summer. But no\r\nadvantage of this kind could compensate for the remoteness of the sun.\r\nThe temperature fell steadily; already, to the discomfiture of the\r\nlittle Italian girl, nurtured in sunshine, ice was beginning to form in\r\nthe crevices of the rocks, and manifestly the time was impending when\r\nthe sea itself would freeze.\r\n\r\nSome shelter must be found before the temperature should fall to 60\r\ndegrees below zero. Otherwise death was inevitable. Hitherto, for the\r\nlast few days, the thermometer had been registering an average of about\r\n6 degrees below zero, and it had become matter of experience that the\r\nstove, although replenished with all the wood that was available, was\r\naltogether inadequate to effect any sensible mitigation of the severity\r\nof the cold. Nor could any amount of fuel be enough. It was certain\r\nthat ere long the very mercury and spirit in the thermometers would be\r\ncongealed. Some other resort must assuredly be soon found, or they must\r\nperish. That was clear.\r\n\r\nThe idea of betaking themselves to the _Dobryna_ and _Hansa_ could not\r\nfor a moment be seriously entertained; not only did the structure of the\r\nvessels make them utterly insufficient to give substantial shelter,\r\nbut they were totally unfitted to be trusted as to their stability when\r\nexposed to the enormous pressure of the accumulated ice.\r\n\r\nNeither Servadac, nor the count, nor Lieutenant Procope were men to\r\nbe easily disheartened, but it could not be concealed that they felt\r\nthemselves in circumstances by which they were equally harassed and\r\nperplexed. The sole expedient that their united counsel could suggest\r\nwas to obtain a refuge below ground, and _that_ was denied them by the\r\nstrange and impenetrable substratum of the soil; yet hour by hour the\r\nsun’s disc was lessening in its dimensions, and although at midday some\r\nfaint radiance and glow were to be distinguished, during the night the\r\npainfulness of the cold was becoming almost intolerable.\r\n\r\nMounted upon Zephyr and Galette, the captain and the count scoured the\r\nisland in search of some available retreat. Scarcely a yard of ground\r\nwas left unexplored, the horses clearing every obstacle as if they were,\r\nlike Pegasus, furnished with wings. But all in vain. Soundings were made\r\nagain and again, but invariably with the same result; the rock, hard as\r\nadamant, never failed to reveal itself within a few feet of the surface\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\nThe excavation of any silo being thus manifestly hopeless, there seemed\r\nnothing to be done except to try and render the buildings alongside the\r\ngourbi impervious to frost. To contribute to the supply of fuel, orders\r\nwere given to collect every scrap of wood, dry or green, that the island\r\nproduced; and this involved the necessity of felling the numerous\r\ntrees that were scattered over the plain. But toil as they might at the\r\naccumulation of firewood, Captain Servadac and his companions could not\r\nresist the conviction that the consumption of a very short period would\r\nexhaust the total stock. And what would happen then?\r\n\r\nStudious if possible to conceal his real misgivings, and anxious that\r\nthe rest of the party should be affected as little as might be by his\r\nown uneasiness, Servadac would wander alone about the island, racking\r\nhis brain for an idea that would point the way out of the serious\r\ndifficulty. But still all in vain.\r\n\r\nOne day he suddenly came upon Ben Zoof, and asked him whether he had no\r\nplan to propose. The orderly shook his head, but after a few moments’\r\npondering, said: “Ah! master, if only we were at Montmartre, we would\r\nget shelter in the charming stone-quarries.”\r\n\r\n“Idiot!” replied the captain, angrily, “if we were at Montmartre, you\r\ndon’t suppose that we should need to live in stone-quarries?”\r\n\r\nBut the means of preservation which human ingenuity had failed to secure\r\nwere at hand from the felicitous provision of Nature herself. It was on\r\nthe 10th of March that the captain and Lieutenant Procope started off\r\nonce more to investigate the northwest corner of the island; on their\r\nway their conversation naturally was engrossed by the subject of\r\nthe dire necessities which only too manifestly were awaiting them. A\r\ndiscussion more than usually animated arose between them, for the two\r\nmen were not altogether of the same mind as to the measures that ought\r\nto be adopted in order to open the fairest chance of avoiding a fatal\r\nclimax to their exposure; the captain persisted that an entirely\r\nnew abode must be sought, while the lieutenant was equally bent upon\r\ndevising a method of some sort by which their present quarters might\r\nbe rendered sufficiently warm. All at once, in the very heat of his\r\nargument, Procope paused; he passed his hand across his eyes, as if to\r\ndispel a mist, and stood, with a fixed gaze centered on a point towards\r\nthe south. “What is that?” he said, with a kind of hesitation. “No, I am\r\nnot mistaken,” he added; “it is a light on the horizon.”\r\n\r\n“A light!” exclaimed Servadac; “show me where.”\r\n\r\n“Look there!” answered the lieutenant, and he kept pointing steadily in\r\nits direction, until Servadac also distinctly saw the bright speck in\r\nthe distance.\r\n\r\nIt increased in clearness in the gathering shades of evening. “Can it be\r\na ship?” asked the captain.\r\n\r\n“If so, it must be in flames; otherwise we should not be able to see it\r\nso far off,” replied Procope.\r\n\r\n“It does not move,” said Servadac; “and unless I am greatly deceived, I\r\ncan hear a kind of reverberation in the air.”\r\n\r\nFor some seconds the two men stood straining eyes and ears in rapt\r\nattention. Suddenly an idea struck Servadac’s mind. “The volcano!” he\r\ncried; “may it not be the volcano that we saw, whilst we were on board\r\nthe _Dobryna?_”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant agreed that it was very probable.\r\n\r\n“Heaven be praised!” ejaculated the captain, and he went on in the tones\r\nof a keen excitement: “Nature has provided us with our winter quarters;\r\nthe stream of burning lava that is flowing there is the gift of a\r\nbounteous Providence; it will provide us all the warmth we need. No time\r\nto lose! To-morrow, my dear Procope, to-morrow we will explore it all;\r\nno doubt the life, the heat we want is reserved for us in the heart and\r\nbowels of our own Gallia!”\r\n\r\nWhilst the captain was indulging in his expressions of enthusiasm,\r\nProcope was endeavoring to collect his thoughts. Distinctly he\r\nremembered the long promontory which had barred the _Dobryna’s_ progress\r\nwhile coasting the southern confines of the sea, and which had obliged\r\nher to ascend northwards as far as the former latitude of Oran; he\r\nremembered also that at the extremity of the promontory there was a\r\nrocky headland crowned with smoke; and now he was convinced that he was\r\nright in identifying the position, and in believing that the smoke had\r\ngiven place to an eruption of flame.\r\n\r\nWhen Servadac gave him a chance of speaking, he said, “The more I\r\nconsider it, captain, the more I am satisfied that your conjecture is\r\ncorrect. Beyond a doubt, what we see is the volcano, and to-morrow we\r\nwill not fail to visit it.”\r\n\r\nOn returning to the gourbi, they communicated their discovery to Count\r\nTimascheff only, deeming any further publication of it to be premature.\r\nThe count at once placed his yacht at their disposal, and expressed his\r\nintention of accompanying them.\r\n\r\n“The yacht, I think,” said Procope, “had better remain where she is;\r\nthe weather is beautifully calm, and the steam-launch will answer our\r\npurpose better; at any rate, it will convey us much closer to shore than\r\nthe schooner.”\r\n\r\nThe count replied that the lieutenant was by all means to use his own\r\ndiscretion, and they all retired for the night.\r\n\r\nLike many other modern pleasure-yachts, the _Dobryna_, in addition to\r\nher four-oar, was fitted with a fast-going little steam-launch, its\r\nscrew being propelled, on the Oriolle system, by means of a boiler,\r\nsmall but very effective. Early next morning, this handy little craft\r\nwas sufficiently freighted with coal (of which there was still about ten\r\ntons on board the _Dobryna_), and manned by nobody except the captain,\r\nthe count, and the lieutenant, left the harbor of the Shelif, much to\r\nthe bewilderment of Ben Zoof, who had not yet been admitted into the\r\nsecret. The orderly, however, consoled himself with the reflection\r\nthat he had been temporarily invested with the full powers of governor\r\ngeneral, an office of which he was not a little proud.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen miles between the island and the headland were made in\r\nsomething less than three hours. The volcanic eruption was manifestly\r\nvery considerable, the entire summit of the promontory being enveloped\r\nin flames. To produce so large a combustion either the oxygen of\r\nGallia’s atmosphere had been brought into contact with the explosive\r\ngases contained beneath her soil, or perhaps, still more probable, the\r\nvolcano, like those in the moon, was fed by an internal supply of oxygen\r\nof her own.\r\n\r\nIt took more than half an hour to settle on a suitable landing-place.\r\nAt length, a small semi-circular creek was discovered among the rocks,\r\nwhich appeared advantageous, because, if circumstances should so\r\nrequire, it would form a safe anchorage for both the _Dobryna_ and the\r\n_Hansa_.\r\n\r\nThe launch securely moored, the passengers landed on the side of the\r\npromontory opposite to that on which a torrent of burning lava was\r\ndescending to the sea. With much satisfaction they experienced, as they\r\napproached the mountain, a sensible difference in the temperature, and\r\ntheir spirits could not do otherwise than rise at the prospect of having\r\ntheir hopes confirmed, that a deliverance from the threatened calamity\r\nhad so opportunely been found. On they went, up the steep acclivity,\r\nscrambling over its rugged projections, scaling the irregularities of\r\nits gigantic strata, bounding from point to point with the agility of\r\nchamois, but never alighting on anything except on the accumulation of\r\nthe same hexagonal prisms with which they had now become so familiar.\r\n\r\nTheir exertions were happily rewarded. Behind a huge pyramidal rock they\r\nfound a hole in the mountain-side, like the mouth of a great tunnel.\r\nClimbing up to this orifice, which was more than sixty feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, they ascertained that it opened into a long dark\r\ngallery. They entered and groped their way cautiously along the sides.\r\nA continuous rumbling, that increased as they advanced, made them aware\r\nthat they must be approaching the central funnel of the volcano; their\r\nonly fear was lest some insuperable wall of rock should suddenly bar\r\ntheir further progress.\r\n\r\nServadac was some distance ahead.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” he cried cheerily, his voice ringing through the darkness,\r\n“come on! Our fire is lighted! no stint of fuel! Nature provides that!\r\nLet us make haste and warm ourselves!”\r\n\r\nInspired by his confidence, the count and the lieutenant advanced\r\nbravely along the unseen and winding path. The temperature was now at\r\nleast fifteen degrees above zero, and the walls of the gallery were\r\nbeginning to feel quite warm to the touch, an indication, not to be\r\noverlooked, that the substance of which the rock was composed was\r\nmetallic in its nature, and capable of conducting heat.\r\n\r\n“Follow me!” shouted Servadac again; “we shall soon find a regular\r\nstove!”\r\n\r\nOnwards they made their way, until at last a sharp turn brought them\r\ninto a sudden flood of light. The tunnel had opened into a vast cavern,\r\nand the gloom was exchanged for an illumination that was perfectly\r\ndazzling. Although the temperature was high, it was not in any way\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nOne glance was sufficient to satisfy the explorers that the grateful\r\nlight and heat of this huge excavation were to be attributed to a\r\ntorrent of lava that was rolling downwards to the sea, completely\r\nsubtending the aperture of the cave. Not inaptly might the scene be\r\ncompared to the celebrated Grotto of the Winds at the rear of the\r\ncentral fall of Niagara, only with the exception that here, instead of\r\na curtain of rushing water, it was a curtain of roaring flame that hung\r\nbefore the cavern’s mouth.\r\n\r\n“Heaven be praised!” cried Servadac, with glad emotion; “here is all\r\nthat we hoped for, and more besides!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. WINTER QUARTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe habitation that had now revealed itself, well lighted and thoroughly\r\nwarm, was indeed marvelous. Not only would it afford ample accommodation\r\nfor Hector Servadac and “his subjects,” as Ben Zoof delighted to\r\ncall them, but it would provide shelter for the two horses, and for a\r\nconsiderable number of domestic animals.\r\n\r\nThis enormous cavern was neither more or less than the common junction\r\nof nearly twenty tunnels (similar to that which had been traversed by\r\nthe explorers), forming ramifications in the solid rock, and the pores,\r\nas it were, by which the internal heat exuded from the heart of the\r\nmountain. Here, as long as the volcano retained its activity, every\r\nliving creature on the new asteroid might brave the most rigorous of\r\nclimates; and as Count Timascheff justly remarked, since it was the only\r\nburning mountain they had sighted, it was most probably the sole outlet\r\nfor Gallia’s subterranean fires, and consequently the eruption might\r\ncontinue unchanged for ages to come.\r\n\r\nBut not a day, not an hour, was to be lost now. The steam-launch\r\nreturned to Gourbi Island, and preparations were forthwith taken in hand\r\nfor conveying man and beast, corn and fodder, across to the volcanic\r\nheadland. Loud and hearty were the acclamations of the little colony,\r\nespecially of the Spaniards, and great was the relief of Nina, when\r\nServadac announced to them the discovery of their future domicile; and\r\nwith requickened energies they labored hard at packing, anxious to reach\r\ntheir genial winter quarters without delay.\r\n\r\nFor three successive days the _Dobryna_, laden to her very gunwale, made\r\na transit to and fro. Ben Zoof was left upon the island to superintend\r\nthe stowage of the freight, whilst Servadac found abundant occupation in\r\noverlooking its disposal within the recesses of the mountain. First\r\nof all, the large store of corn and fodder, the produce of the recent\r\nharvest, was landed and deposited in one of the vaults; then, on the\r\n15th, about fifty head of live cattle--bullocks, cows, sheep, and\r\npigs--were conveyed to their rocky stalls. These were saved for the sake\r\nof preserving the several breeds, the bulk of the island cattle being\r\nslaughtered, as the extreme severity of the climate insured all meat\r\nremaining fresh for almost an indefinite period. The winter which they\r\nwere expecting would probably be of unprecedented length; it was quite\r\nlikely that it would exceed the six months’ duration by which many\r\narctic explorers have been tried; but the population of Gallia had\r\nno anxiety in the matter of provisions--their stock was far more than\r\nadequate; while as for drink, as long as they were satisfied with pure\r\nwater, a frozen sea would afford them an inexhaustible reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe need for haste in forwarding their preparations became more and more\r\nmanifest; the sea threatened to be un-navigable very soon, as ice was\r\nalready forming which the noonday sun was unable to melt. And if haste\r\nwere necessary, so also were care, ingenuity, and forethought. It\r\nwas indispensable that the space at their command should be properly\r\nutilized, and yet that the several portions of the store should all be\r\nreadily accessible.\r\n\r\nOn further investigation an unexpected number of galleries was\r\ndiscovered, so that, in fact, the interior of the mountain was like a\r\nvast bee-hive perforated with innumerable cells; and in compliment to\r\nthe little Italian it was unanimously voted by the colony that their new\r\nhome should be called “Nina’s Hive.”\r\n\r\nThe first care of Captain Servadac was to ascertain how he could make\r\nthe best possible use of the heat which nature had provided for them\r\nso opportunely and with so lavish a hand. By opening fresh vents in the\r\nsolid rock (which by the action of the heat was here capable of fissure)\r\nthe stream of burning lava was diverted into several new channels, where\r\nit could be available for daily use; and thus Mochel, the _Dobryna’s_\r\ncook, was furnished with an admirable kitchen, provided with a permanent\r\nstove, where he was duly installed with all his culinary apparatus.\r\n\r\n“What a saving of expense it would be,” exclaimed Ben Zoof, “if every\r\nhousehold could be furnished with its own private volcano!”\r\n\r\nThe large cavern at the general junction of the galleries was fitted up\r\nas a drawing-room, and arranged with all the best furniture both of the\r\ngourbi and of the cabin of the _Dobryna_. Hither was also brought the\r\nschooner’s library, containing a good variety of French and Russian\r\nbooks; lamps were suspended over the different tables; and the walls of\r\nthe apartment were tapestried with the sails and adorned with the flags\r\nbelonging to the yacht. The curtain of fire extending over the opening\r\nof the cavern provided it, as already stated, with light and heat.\r\n\r\nThe torrent of lava fell into a small rock-bound basin that had no\r\napparent communication with the sea, and was evidently the aperture of\r\na deep abyss, of which the waters, heated by the descent of the eruptive\r\nmatter, would no doubt retain their liquid condition long after the\r\nGallian Sea had become a sheet of ice.\r\n\r\nA small excavation to the left of the common hall was allotted for\r\nthe special use of Servadac and the count; another on the right was\r\nappropriated to the lieutenant and Ben Zoof; whilst a third recess,\r\nimmediately at the back, made a convenient little chamber for Nina. The\r\nSpaniards and the Russian sailors took up their sleeping-quarters in the\r\nadjacent galleries, and found the temperature quite comfortable.\r\n\r\nSuch were the internal arrangements of Nina’s Hive, the refuge where\r\nthe little colony were full of hope that they would be able to brave\r\nthe rigors of the stern winter-time that lay before them--a winter-time\r\nduring which Gallia might possibly be projected even to the orbit of\r\nJupiter, where the temperature would not exceed one twenty-fifth of the\r\nnormal winter temperature of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe only discontented spirit was Isaac Hakkabut. Throughout all the\r\npreparations which roused even the Spaniards to activity, the Jew,\r\nstill incredulous and deaf to every representation of the true state of\r\nthings, insisted upon remaining in the creek at Gourbi Island; nothing\r\ncould induce him to leave his tartan, where, like a miser, he would keep\r\nguard over his precious cargo, ever grumbling and growling, but with his\r\nweather-eye open in the hope of catching sight of some passing sail. It\r\nmust be owned that the whole party were far from sorry to be relieved\r\nof his presence; his uncomely figure and repulsive countenance was\r\na perpetual bugbear. He had given out in plain terms that he did not\r\nintend to part with any of his property, except for current money, and\r\nServadac, equally resolute, had strictly forbidden any purchases to be\r\nmade, hoping to wear out the rascal’s obstinacy.\r\n\r\nHakkabut persistently refused to credit the real situation; he could\r\nnot absolutely deny that some portions of the terrestrial globe had\r\nundergone a certain degree of modification, but nothing could bring him\r\nto believe that he was not, sooner or later, to résumé his old line of\r\nbusiness in the Mediterranean. With his wonted distrust of all with whom\r\nhe came in contact, he regarded every argument that was urged upon him\r\nonly as evidence of a plot that had been devised to deprive him of his\r\ngoods. Repudiating, as he did utterly, the hypothesis that a fragment\r\nhad become detached from the earth, he scanned the horizon for hours\r\ntogether with an old telescope, the case of which had been patched up\r\ntill it looked like a rusty stove-pipe, hoping to descry the passing\r\ntrader with which he might effect some bartering upon advantageous\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nAt first he professed to regard the proposed removal into\r\nwinter-quarters as an attempt to impose upon his credulity; but the\r\nfrequent voyages made by the _Dobryna_ to the south, and the repeated\r\nconsignments of corn and cattle, soon served to make him aware that\r\nCaptain Servadac and his companions were really contemplating a\r\ndeparture from Gourbi Island.\r\n\r\nThe movement set him thinking. What, he began to ask himself--what\r\nif all that was told him was true? What if this sea was no longer\r\nthe Mediterranean? What if he should never again behold his German\r\nfatherland? What if his marts for business were gone for ever? A vague\r\nidea of ruin began to take possession of his mind: he must yield\r\nto necessity; he must do the best he could. As the result of his\r\ncogitations, he occasionally left his tartan and made a visit to the\r\nshore. At length he endeavored to mingle with the busy group, who were\r\nhurrying on their preparations; but his advances were only met by jeers\r\nand scorn, and, ridiculed by all the rest, he was fain to turn his\r\nattention to Ben Zoof, to whom he offered a few pinches of tobacco.\r\n\r\n“No, old Zebulon,” said Ben Zoof, steadily refusing the gift, “it is\r\nagainst orders to take anything from you. Keep your cargo to yourself;\r\neat and drink it all if you can; we are not to touch it.”\r\n\r\nFinding the subordinates incorruptible, Isaac determined to go to the\r\nfountain-head. He addressed himself to Servadac, and begged him to tell\r\nhim the whole truth, piteously adding that surely it was unworthy of a\r\nFrench officer to deceive a poor old man like himself.\r\n\r\n“Tell you the truth, man!” cried Servadac. “Confound it, I have told\r\nyou the truth twenty times. Once for all, I tell you now, you have left\r\nyourself barely time enough to make your escape to yonder mountain.”\r\n\r\n“God and Mahomet have mercy on me!” muttered the Jew, whose creed\r\nfrequently assumed a very ambiguous character.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you what,” continued the captain--“you shall have a few men\r\nto work the _Hansa_ across, if you like.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to go to Algiers,” whimpered Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“How often am I to tell you that Algiers is no longer in existence? Only\r\nsay yes or no--are you coming with us into winter-quarters?”\r\n\r\n“God of Israel! what is to become of all my property?”\r\n\r\n“But, mind you,” continued the captain, not heeding the interruption,\r\n“if you do not choose voluntarily to come with us, I shall have the\r\n_Hansa_, by my orders, removed to a place of safety. I am not going\r\nto let your cursed obstinacy incur the risk of losing your cargo\r\naltogether.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful Heaven! I shall be ruined!” moaned Isaac, in despair.\r\n\r\n“You are going the right way to ruin yourself, and it would serve you\r\nright to leave you to your own devices. But be off! I have no more to\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\nAnd, turning contemptuously on his heel, Servadac left the old man\r\nvociferating bitterly, and with uplifted hands protesting vehemently\r\nagainst the rapacity of the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nBy the 20th all preliminary arrangements were complete, and everything\r\nready for a final departure from the island. The thermometer stood on\r\nan average at 8 degrees below zero, and the water in the cistern was\r\ncompletely frozen. It was determined, therefore, for the colony to\r\nembark on the following day, and take up their residence in Nina’s Hive.\r\n\r\nA final consultation was held about the _Hansa_. Lieutenant Procope\r\npronounced his decided conviction that it would be impossible for the\r\ntartan to resist the pressure of the ice in the harbor of the Shelif,\r\nand that there would be far more safety in the proximity of the\r\nvolcano. It was agreed on all hands that the vessel must be shifted; and\r\naccordingly orders were given, four Russian sailors were sent on board,\r\nand only a few minutes elapsed after the _Dobryna_ had weighed anchor,\r\nbefore the great lateen sail of the tartan was unfurled, and the\r\n“shop-ship,” as Ben Zoof delighted to call it, was also on her way to\r\nthe southward.\r\n\r\nLong and loud were the lamentations of the Jew. He kept exclaiming that\r\nhe had given no orders, that he was being moved against his will, that\r\nhe had asked for no assistance, and needed none; but it required no very\r\nkeen discrimination to observe that all along there was a lurking gleam\r\nof satisfaction in his little gray eyes, and when, a few hours later, he\r\nfound himself securely anchored, and his property in a place of safety,\r\nhe quite chuckled with glee.\r\n\r\n“God of Israel!” he said in an undertone, “they have made no charge; the\r\nidiots have piloted me here for nothing.”\r\n\r\nFor nothing! His whole nature exulted in the consciousness that he was\r\nenjoying a service that had been rendered gratuitously.\r\n\r\nDestitute of human inhabitants, Gourbi Island was now left to the\r\ntenancy of such birds and beasts as had escaped the recent promiscuous\r\nslaughter. Birds, indeed, that had migrated in search of warmer shores,\r\nhad returned, proving that this fragment of the French colony was the\r\nonly shred of land that could yield them any sustenance; but their life\r\nmust necessarily be short. It was utterly impossible that they could\r\nsurvive the cold that would soon ensue.\r\n\r\nThe colony took possession of their new abode with but few formalities.\r\nEveryone, however, approved of all the internal arrangements of Nina’s\r\nHive, and were profuse in their expressions of satisfaction at finding\r\nthemselves located in such comfortable quarters. The only malcontent\r\nwas Hakkabut; he had no share in the general enthusiasm, refused even\r\nto enter or inspect any of the galleries, and insisted on remaining on\r\nboard his tartan.\r\n\r\n“He is afraid,” said Ben Zoof, “that he will have to pay for his\r\nlodgings. But wait a bit; we shall see how he stands the cold out there;\r\nthe frost, no doubt, will drive the old fox out of his hole.”\r\n\r\nTowards evening the pots were set boiling, and a bountiful supper, to\r\nwhich all were invited, was spread in the central hall. The stores of\r\nthe _Dobryna_ contained some excellent wine, some of which was broached\r\nto do honor to the occasion. The health of the governor general was\r\ndrunk, as well as the toast “Success to his council,” to which Ben Zoof\r\nwas called upon to return thanks. The entertainment passed off merrily.\r\nThe Spaniards were in the best of spirits; one of them played the\r\nguitar, another the castanets, and the rest joined in a ringing chorus.\r\nBen Zoof contributed the famous Zouave refrain, well known throughout\r\nthe French army, but rarely performed in finer style than by this\r\n_virtuoso:_\r\n\r\n     _“Misti goth dar dar tire lyre!\r\n     Flic! floc! flac! lirette, lira!\r\n               Far la rira,\r\n               Tour tala rire,\r\n               Tour la Ribaud,\r\n                 Ricandeau,\r\n     Sans repos, repit, repit, repos, ris pot, ripette!\r\n        Si vous attrapez mon refrain,\r\n              Fameux vous etes.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concert was succeeded by a ball, unquestionably the first that had\r\never taken place in Gallia. The Russian sailors exhibited some of their\r\nnational dances, which gained considerable applause, even although they\r\nfollowed upon the marvelous fandangos of the Spaniards. Ben Zoof, in\r\nhis turn, danced a _pas seul_ (often performed in the Elysee Montmartre)\r\nwith an elegance and vigor that earned many compliments from Negrete.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o’clock before the festivities came to an end, and by that\r\ntime the company, heated by the high temperature of the hall, and by\r\ntheir own exertions, felt the want of a little fresh air. Accordingly\r\nthe greater portion of the party, escorted by Ben Zoof, made their way\r\ninto one of the adjacent galleries that led to the shore. Servadac,\r\nwith the count and lieutenant, did not follow immediately; but shortly\r\nafterwards they proceeded to join them, when on their way they were\r\nstartled by loud cries from those in advance.\r\n\r\nTheir first impression was that they were cries of distress, and they\r\nwere greatly relieved to find that they were shouts of delight, which\r\nthe dryness and purity of the atmosphere caused to re-echo like a volley\r\nof musketry.\r\n\r\nReaching the mouth of the gallery, they found the entire group pointing\r\nwith eager interest to the sky.\r\n\r\n“Well, Ben Zoof,” asked the captain, “what’s the matter now?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your Excellency,” ejaculated the orderly, “look there! look there!\r\nThe moon! the moon’s come back!”\r\n\r\nAnd, sure enough, what was apparently the moon was rising above the\r\nmists of evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. A FROZEN OCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon! She had disappeared for weeks; was she now returning? Had\r\nshe been faithless to the earth? and had she now approached to be a\r\nsatellite of the new-born world?\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” said Lieutenant Procope; “the earth is millions and\r\nmillions of leagues away, and it is not probable that the moon has\r\nceased to revolve about her.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” remonstrated Servadac. “It would not be more strange than the\r\nother phenomena which we have lately witnessed. Why should not the moon\r\nhave fallen within the limits of Gallia’s attraction, and become her\r\nsatellite?”\r\n\r\n“Upon that supposition,” put in the count, “I should think that it would\r\nbe altogether unlikely that three months would elapse without our seeing\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Quite incredible!” continued Procope. “And there is another thing which\r\ntotally disproves the captain’s hypothesis; the magnitude of Gallia\r\nis far too insignificant for her power of attraction to carry off the\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\n“But,” persisted Servadac, “why should not the same convulsion that tore\r\nus away from the earth have torn away the moon as well? After wandering\r\nabout as she would for a while in the solar regions, I do not see why\r\nshe should not have attached herself to us.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant repeated his conviction that it was not likely.\r\n\r\n“But why not?” again asked Servadac impetuously.\r\n\r\n“Because, I tell you, the mass of Gallia is so inferior to that of the\r\nmoon, that Gallia would become the moon’s satellite; the moon could not\r\npossibly become hers.”\r\n\r\n“Assuming, however,” continued Servadac, “such to be the case--”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid,” said the lieutenant, interrupting him, “that I cannot\r\nassume anything of the sort even for a moment.”\r\n\r\nServadac smiled good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n“I confess you seem to have the best of the argument, and if Gallia had\r\nbecome a satellite of the moon, it would not have taken three months to\r\ncatch sight of her. I suppose you are right.”\r\n\r\nWhile this discussion had been going on, the satellite, or whatever it\r\nmight be, had been rising steadily above the horizon, and had reached a\r\nposition favorable for observation. Telescopes were brought, and it was\r\nvery soon ascertained, beyond a question, that the new luminary was not\r\nthe well-known Phoebe of terrestrial nights; it had no feature in common\r\nwith the moon. Although it was apparently much nearer to Gallia than the\r\nmoon to the earth, its superficies was hardly one-tenth as large, and\r\nso feebly did it reflect the light of the remote sun, that it scarcely\r\nemitted radiance enough to extinguish the dim luster of stars of the\r\neighth magnitude. Like the sun, it had risen in the west, and was now\r\nat its full. To mistake its identity with the moon was absolutely\r\nimpossible; not even Servadac could discover a trace of the seas,\r\nchasms, craters, and mountains which have been so minutely delineated\r\nin lunar charts, and it could not be denied that any transient hope\r\nthat had been excited as to their once again being about to enjoy the\r\npeaceful smiles of “the queen of night” must all be resigned.\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff finally suggested, though somewhat doubtfully, the\r\nquestion of the probability that Gallia, in her course across the zone\r\nof the minor planets, had carried off one of them; but whether it\r\nwas one of the 169 asteroids already included in the astronomical\r\ncatalogues, or one previously unknown, he did not presume to determine.\r\nThe idea to a certain extent was plausible, inasmuch as it has been\r\nascertained that several of the telescopic planets are of such small\r\ndimensions that a good walker might make a circuit of them in four and\r\ntwenty hours; consequently Gallia, being of superior volume, might be\r\nsupposed capable of exercising a power of attraction upon any of these\r\nminiature microcosms.\r\n\r\nThe first night in Nina’s Hive passed without special incident; and\r\nnext morning a regular scheme of life was definitely laid down. “My lord\r\ngovernor,” as Ben Zoof until he was peremptorily forbidden delighted to\r\ncall Servadac, had a wholesome dread of idleness and its consequences,\r\nand insisted upon each member of the party undertaking some special\r\nduty to fulfill. There was plenty to do. The domestic animals required\r\na great deal of attention; a supply of food had to be secured and\r\npreserved; fishing had to be carried on while the condition of the sea\r\nwould allow it; and in several places the galleries had to be further\r\nexcavated to render them more available for use. Occupation, then, need\r\nnever be wanting, and the daily round of labor could go on in orderly\r\nroutine.\r\n\r\nA perfect concord ruled the little colony. The Russians and Spaniards\r\namalgamated well, and both did their best to pick up various scraps\r\nof French, which was considered the official language of the place.\r\nServadac himself undertook the tuition of Pablo and Nina, Ben Zoof being\r\ntheir companion in play-hours, when he entertained them with enchanting\r\nstories in the best Parisian French, about “a lovely city at the foot of\r\na mountain,” where he always promised one day to take them.\r\n\r\nThe end of March came, but the cold was not intense to such a degree\r\nas to confine any of the party to the interior of their resort; several\r\nexcursions were made along the shore, and for a radius of three or\r\nfour miles the adjacent district was carefully explored. Investigation,\r\nhowever, always ended in the same result; turn their course in whatever\r\ndirection they would, they found that the country retained everywhere\r\nits desert character, rocky, barren, and without a trace of vegetation.\r\nHere and there a slight layer of snow, or a thin coating of ice arising\r\nfrom atmospheric condensation indicated the existence of superficial\r\nmoisture, but it would require a period indefinitely long, exceeding\r\nhuman reckoning, before that moisture could collect into a stream and\r\nroll downwards over the stony strata to the sea. It seemed at present\r\nout of their power to determine whether the land upon which they were\r\nso happily settled was an island or a continent, and till the cold was\r\nabated they feared to undertake any lengthened expedition to ascertain\r\nthe actual extent of the strange concrete of metallic crystallization.\r\n\r\nBy ascending one day to the summit of the volcano, Captain Servadac\r\nand the count succeeded in getting a general idea of the aspect of the\r\ncountry. The mountain itself was an enormous block rising symmetrically\r\nto a height of nearly 3,000 feet above the level of the sea, in the\r\nform of a truncated cone, of which the topmost section was crowned by a\r\nwreath of smoke issuing continuously from the mouth of a narrow crater.\r\n\r\nUnder the old condition of terrestrial things, the ascent of this steep\r\nacclivity would have been attended with much fatigue, but as the effect\r\nof the altered condition of the law of gravity, the travelers performed\r\nperpetual prodigies in the way of agility, and in little over an hour\r\nreached the edge of the crater, without more sense of exertion than if\r\nthey had traversed a couple of miles on level ground. Gallia had its\r\ndrawbacks, but it had some compensating advantages.\r\n\r\nTelescopes in hand, the explorers from the summit scanned the\r\nsurrounding view. Their anticipations had already realized what they\r\nsaw. Just as they expected, on the north, east, and west lay the Gallian\r\nSea, smooth and motionless as a sheet of glass, the cold having, as it\r\nwere, congealed the atmosphere so that there was not a breath of wind.\r\nTowards the south there seemed no limit to the land, and the volcano\r\nformed the apex of a triangle, of which the base was beyond the reach of\r\nvision. Viewed even from this height, whence distance would do much\r\nto soften the general asperity, the surface nevertheless seemed to\r\nbe bristling with its myriads of hexagonal lamellae, and to present\r\ndifficulties which, to an ordinary pedestrian, would be insurmountable.\r\n\r\n“Oh for some wings, or else a balloon!” cried Servadac, as he gazed\r\naround him; and then, looking down to the rock upon which they were\r\nstanding, he added, “We seem to have been transplanted to a soil strange\r\nenough in its chemical character to bewilder the _savants_ at a museum.”\r\n\r\n“And do you observe, captain,” asked the count, “how the convexity\r\nof our little world curtails our view? See, how circumscribed is the\r\nhorizon!”\r\n\r\nServadac replied that he had noticed the same circumstance from the top\r\nof the cliffs of Gourbi Island.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the count; “it becomes more and more obvious that ours is a\r\nvery tiny world, and that Gourbi Island is the sole productive spot upon\r\nits surface. We have had a short summer, and who knows whether we\r\nare not entering upon a winter that may last for years, perhaps for\r\ncenturies?”\r\n\r\n“But we must not mind, count,” said Servadac, smiling. “We have agreed,\r\nyou know, that, come what may, we are to be philosophers.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, true, my friend,” rejoined the count; “we must be philosophers\r\nand something more; we must be grateful to the good Protector who has\r\nhitherto befriended us, and we must trust His mercy to the end.”\r\n\r\nFor a few moments they both stood in silence, and contemplated land and\r\nsea; then, having given a last glance over the dreary panorama, they\r\nprepared to wend their way down the mountain. Before, however, they\r\ncommenced their descent, they resolved to make a closer examination of\r\nthe crater. They were particularly struck by what seemed to them almost\r\nthe mysterious calmness with which the eruption was effected. There was\r\nnone of the wild disorder and deafening tumult that usually accompany\r\nthe discharge of volcanic matter, but the heated lava, rising with a\r\nuniform gentleness, quietly overran the limits of the crater, like the\r\nflow of water from the bosom of a peaceful lake. Instead of a boiler\r\nexposed to the action of an angry fire, the crater rather resembled a\r\nbrimming basin, of which the contents were noiselessly escaping. Nor\r\nwere there any igneous stones or red-hot cinders mingled with the smoke\r\nthat crowned the summit; a circumstance that quite accorded with the\r\nabsence of the pumice-stones, obsidians, and other minerals of volcanic\r\norigin with which the base of a burning mountain is generally strewn.\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac was of opinion that this peculiarity augured favorably\r\nfor the continuance of the eruption. Extreme violence in physical, as\r\nwell as in moral nature, is never of long duration. The most terrible\r\nstorms, like the most violent fits of passion, are not lasting; but here\r\nthe calm flow of the liquid fire appeared to be supplied from a source\r\nthat was inexhaustible, in the same way as the waters of Niagara,\r\ngliding on steadily to their final plunge, would defy all effort to\r\narrest their course.\r\n\r\nBefore the evening of this day closed in, a most important change was\r\neffected in the condition of the Gallian Sea by the intervention of\r\nhuman agency. Notwithstanding the increasing cold, the sea, unruffled\r\nas it was by a breath of wind, still retained its liquid state. It is an\r\nestablished fact that water, under this condition of absolute stillness,\r\nwill remain uncongealed at a temperature several degrees below zero,\r\nwhilst experiment, at the same time, shows that a very slight shock will\r\noften be sufficient to convert it into solid ice. It had occurred to\r\nServadac that if some communication could be opened with Gourbi Island,\r\nthere would be a fine scope for hunting expeditions. Having this\r\nultimate object in view, he assembled his little colony upon a\r\nprojecting rock at the extremity of the promontory, and having called\r\nNina and Pablo out to him in front, he said: “Now, Nina, do you think\r\nyou could throw something into the sea?”\r\n\r\n“I think I could,” replied the child, “but I am sure that Pablo would\r\nthrow it a great deal further than I can.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, you shall try first.”\r\n\r\nPutting a fragment of ice into Nina’s hand, he addressed himself to\r\nPablo:\r\n\r\n“Look out, Pablo; you shall see what a nice little fairy Nina is! Throw,\r\nNina, throw, as hard as you can.”\r\n\r\nNina balanced the piece of ice two or three times in her hand, and threw\r\nit forward with all her strength.\r\n\r\nA sudden thrill seemed to vibrate across the motionless waters to the\r\ndistant horizon, and the Gallian Sea had become a solid sheet of ice!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. A CARRIER-PIGEON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, three hours after sunset, on the 23d of March, the Gallian moon\r\nrose upon the western horizon, it was observed that she had entered upon\r\nher last quarter. She had taken only four days to pass from syzygy to\r\nquadrature, and it was consequently evident that she would be visible\r\nfor little more than a week at a time, and that her lunation would be\r\naccomplished within sixteen days. The lunar months, like the solar\r\ndays, had been diminished by one-half. Three days later the moon was in\r\nconjunction with the sun, and was consequently lost to view; Ben Zoof,\r\nas the first observer of the satellite, was extremely interested in its\r\nmovements, and wondered whether it would ever reappear.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, under an atmosphere perfectly clear and dry, the\r\nthermometer fell to 12 degrees F. below zero. Of the present distance of\r\nGallia from the sun, and the number of leagues she had traversed since\r\nthe receipt of the last mysterious document, there were no means of\r\njudging; the extent of diminution in the apparent disc of the sun did\r\nnot afford sufficient basis even for an approximate calculation; and\r\nCaptain Servadac was perpetually regretting that they could receive no\r\nfurther tidings from the anonymous correspondent, whom he persisted in\r\nregarding as a fellow-countryman.\r\n\r\nThe solidity of the ice was perfect; the utter stillness of the air at\r\nthe time when the final congelation of the waters had taken place had\r\nresulted in the formation of a surface that for smoothness would rival\r\na skating-rink; without a crack or flaw it extended far beyond the range\r\nof vision.\r\n\r\nThe contrast to the ordinary aspect of polar seas was very remarkable.\r\nThere, the ice-fields are an agglomeration of hummocks and icebergs,\r\nmassed in wild confusion, often towering higher than the masts of the\r\nlargest whalers, and from the instability of their foundations liable\r\nto an instantaneous loss of equilibrium; a breath of wind, a slight\r\nmodification of the temperature, not unfrequently serving to bring about\r\na series of changes outrivaling the most elaborate transformation scenes\r\nof a pantomime. Here, on the contrary, the vast white plain was level as\r\nthe desert of Sahara or the Russian steppes; the waters of the Gallian\r\nSea were imprisoned beneath the solid sheet, which became continually\r\nstouter in the increasing cold.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to the uneven crystallizations of their own frozen seas, the\r\nRussians could not be otherwise than delighted with the polished\r\nsurface that afforded them such excellent opportunity for enjoying\r\ntheir favorite pastime of skating. A supply of skates, found hidden\r\naway amongst the _Dobryna’s_ stores, was speedily brought into use. The\r\nRussians undertook the instruction of the Spaniards, and at the end of\r\na few days, during which the temperature was only endurable through the\r\nabsence of wind, there was not a Gallian who could not skate tolerably\r\nwell, while many of them could describe figures involving the most\r\ncomplicated curves. Nina and Pablo earned loud applause by their rapid\r\nproficiency; Captain Servadac, an adept in athletics, almost outvied his\r\ninstructor, the count; and Ben Zoof, who had upon some rare occasions\r\nskated upon the Lake of Montmartre (in his eyes, of course, a sea),\r\nperformed prodigies in the art.\r\n\r\nThis exercise was not only healthful in itself, but it was acknowledged\r\nthat, in case of necessity, it might become a very useful means of\r\nlocomotion. As Captain Servadac remarked, it was almost a substitute for\r\nrailways, and as if to illustrate this proposition, Lieutenant Procope,\r\nperhaps the greatest expert in the party, accomplished the twenty miles\r\nto Gourbi Island and back in considerably less than four hours.\r\n\r\nThe temperature, meanwhile, continued to decrease, and the average\r\nreading of the thermometer was about 16 degrees F. below zero; the light\r\nalso diminished in proportion, and all objects appeared to be enveloped\r\nin a half-defined shadow, as though the sun were undergoing a perpetual\r\neclipse. It was not surprising that the effect of this continuously\r\noverhanging gloom should be to induce a frequent depression of spirits\r\namongst the majority of the little population, exiles as they were from\r\ntheir mother earth, and not unlikely, as it seemed, to be swept far away\r\ninto the regions of another planetary sphere. Probably Count Timascheff,\r\nCaptain Servadac, and Lieutenant Procope were the only members of the\r\ncommunity who could bring any scientific judgment to bear upon the\r\nuncertainty that was before them, but a general sense of the strangeness\r\nof their situation could not fail at times to weigh heavily upon\r\nthe minds of all. Under these circumstances it was very necessary to\r\ncounteract the tendency to despond by continual diversion; and the\r\nrecreation of skating thus opportunely provided, seemed just the thing\r\nto arouse the flagging spirits, and to restore a wholesome excitement.\r\n\r\nWith dogged obstinacy, Isaac Hakkabut refused to take any share either\r\nin the labors or the amusements of the colony. In spite of the cold,\r\nhe had not been seen since the day of his arrival from Gourbi Island.\r\nCaptain Servadac had strictly forbidden any communication with him; and\r\nthe smoke that rose from the cabin chimney of the _Hansa_ was the sole\r\nindication of the proprietor being still on board. There was nothing to\r\nprevent him, if he chose, from partaking gratuitously of the volcanic\r\nlight and heat which were being enjoyed by all besides; but rather\r\nthan abandon his close and personal oversight of his precious cargo, he\r\npreferred to sacrifice his own slender stock of fuel.\r\n\r\nBoth the schooner and the tartan had been carefully moored in the way\r\nthat seemed to promise best for withstanding the rigor of the winter.\r\nAfter seeing the vessels made secure in the frozen creek. Lieutenant\r\nProcope, following the example of many Arctic explorers, had the\r\nprecaution to have the ice beveled away from the keels, so that there\r\nshould be no risk of the ships’ sides being crushed by the increasing\r\npressure; he hoped that they would follow any rise in the level of the\r\nice-field, and when the thaw should come, that they would easily regain\r\ntheir proper water-line.\r\n\r\nOn his last visit to Gourbi Island, the lieutenant had ascertained that\r\nnorth, east, and west, far as the eye could reach, the Gallian Sea had\r\nbecome one uniform sheet of ice. One spot alone refused to freeze; this\r\nwas the pool immediately below the central cavern, the receptacle for\r\nthe stream of burning lava. It was entirely enclosed by rocks, and if\r\never a few icicles were formed there by the action of the cold, they\r\nwere very soon melted by the fiery shower. Hissing and spluttering as\r\nthe hot lava came in contact with it, the water was in a continual\r\nstate of ebullition, and the fish that abounded in its depths defied\r\nthe angler’s craft; they were, as Ben Zoof remarked, “too much boiled to\r\nbite.”\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of April the weather changed. The sky became overcast,\r\nbut there was no rise in the temperature. Unlike the polar winters of\r\nthe earth, which ordinarily are affected by atmospheric influence, and\r\nliable to slight intermissions of their severity at various shiftings\r\nof the wind, Gallia’s winter was caused by her immense distance from the\r\nsource of all light and heat, and the cold was consequently destined\r\nto go on steadily increasing until it reached the limit ascertained by\r\nFourier to be the normal temperature of the realms of space.\r\n\r\nWith the over-clouding of the heavens there arose a violent tempest;\r\nbut although the wind raged with an almost inconceivable fury, it\r\nwas unaccompanied by either snow or rain. Its effect upon the burning\r\ncurtain that covered the aperture of the central hall was very\r\nremarkable. So far from there being any likelihood of the fire being\r\nextinguished by the vehemence of the current of air, the hurricane\r\nseemed rather to act as a ventilator, which fanned the flame into\r\ngreater activity, and the utmost care was necessary to avoid being burnt\r\nby the fragments of lava that were drifted into the interior of the\r\ngrotto. More than once the curtain itself was rifted entirely asunder,\r\nbut only to close up again immediately after allowing a momentary\r\ndraught of cold air to penetrate the hall in a way that was refreshing\r\nand rather advantageous than otherwise.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of April, after an absence of about four days, the new\r\nsatellite, to Ben Zoof’s great satisfaction, made its reappearance in\r\na crescent form, a circumstance that seemed to justify the anticipation\r\nthat henceforward it would continue to make a periodic revolution every\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nThe crust of ice and snow was far too stout for the beaks of the\r\nstrongest birds to penetrate, and accordingly large swarms had left the\r\nisland, and, following the human population, had taken refuge on the\r\nvolcanic promontory; not that there the barren shore had anything in the\r\nway of nourishment to offer them, but their instinct impelled them to\r\nhaunt now the very habitations which formerly they would have shunned.\r\nScraps of food were thrown to them from the galleries; these were\r\nspeedily devoured, but were altogether inadequate in quantity to meet\r\nthe demand. At length, emboldened by hunger, several hundred birds\r\nventured through the tunnel, and took up their quarters actually in\r\nNina’s Hive. Congregating in the large hall, the half-famished creatures\r\ndid not hesitate to snatch bread, meat, or food of any description from\r\nthe hands of the residents as they sat at table, and soon became such an\r\nintolerable nuisance that it formed one of the daily diversions to hunt\r\nthem down; but although they were vigorously attacked by stones and\r\nsticks, and even occasionally by shot, it was with some difficulty that\r\ntheir number could be sensibly reduced.\r\n\r\nBy a systematic course of warfare the bulk of the birds were all\r\nexpelled, with the exception of about a hundred, which began to build in\r\nthe crevices of the rocks. These were left in quiet possession of their\r\nquarters, as not only was it deemed advisable to perpetuate the various\r\nbreeds, but it was found that these birds acted as a kind of police,\r\nnever failing either to chase away or to kill any others of their\r\nspecies who infringed upon what they appeared to regard as their own\r\nspecial privilege in intruding within the limits of their domain.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th loud cries were suddenly heard issuing from the mouth of the\r\nprincipal gallery.\r\n\r\n“Help, help! I shall be killed!”\r\n\r\nPablo in a moment recognized the voice as Nina’s. Outrunning even Ben\r\nZoof he hurried to the assistance of his little playmate, and discovered\r\nthat she was being attacked by half a dozen great sea-gulls, and only\r\nafter receiving some severe blows from their beaks could he succeed by\r\nmeans of a stout cudgel in driving them away.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Nina, what is this?” he asked as soon as the tumult had\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\nThe child pointed to a bird which she was caressing tenderly in her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n“A pigeon!” exclaimed Ben Zoof, who had reached the scene of commotion,\r\nadding:\r\n\r\n“A carrier-pigeon! And by all the saints of Montmartre, there is a\r\nlittle bag attached to its neck!”\r\n\r\nHe took the bird, and rushing into the hall placed it in Servadac’s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Another message, no doubt,” cried the captain, “from our unknown\r\nfriend. Let us hope that this time he has given us his name and\r\naddress.”\r\n\r\nAll crowded round, eager to hear the news. In the struggle with the\r\ngulls the bag had been partially torn open, but still contained the\r\nfollowing dispatch:\r\n\r\n“Gallia!\r\n\r\nChemin parcouru du 1er Mars au 1er Avril: 39,000,000 l.!\r\n\r\nDistance du soleil: 110,000,000 l.!\r\n\r\nCapte Nerina en passant.\r\n\r\nVivres vont manquer et...”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the document had been so damaged by the beaks of the gulls\r\nthat it was illegible. Servadac was wild with vexation. He felt more and\r\nmore convinced that the writer was a Frenchman, and that the last\r\nline indicated that he was in distress from scarcity of food. The\r\nvery thought of a fellow-countryman in peril of starvation drove him\r\nwell-nigh to distraction, and it was in vain that search was made\r\neverywhere near the scene of conflict in hopes of finding the missing\r\nscrap that might bear a signature or address.\r\n\r\nSuddenly little Nina, who had again taken possession of the pigeon, and\r\nwas hugging it to her breast, said:\r\n\r\n“Look here, Ben Zoof!”\r\n\r\nAnd as she spoke she pointed to the left wing of the bird. The wing bore\r\nthe faint impress of a postage-stamp, and the one word: “FORMENTERA.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. A SLEDGE-RIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nFormentera was at once recognized by Servadac and the count as the\r\nname of one of the smallest of the Balearic Islands. It was more than\r\nprobable that the unknown writer had thence sent out the mysterious\r\ndocuments, and from the message just come to hand by the carrier-pigeon,\r\nit appeared all but certain that at the beginning of April, a fortnight\r\nback, he had still been there. In one important particular the present\r\ncommunication differed from those that had preceded it: it was written\r\nentirely in French, and exhibited none of the ecstatic exclamations in\r\nother languages that had been remarkable in the two former papers. The\r\nconcluding line, with its intimation of failing provisions, amounted\r\nalmost to an appeal for help. Captain Servadac briefly drew attention\r\nto these points, and concluded by saying, “My friends, we must, without\r\ndelay, hasten to the assistance of this unfortunate man.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said the count, “I am quite ready to accompany you; it is\r\nnot unlikely that he is not alone in his distress.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope expressed much surprise. “We must have passed close\r\nto Formentera,” he said, “when we explored the site of the Balearic\r\nIsles; this fragment must be very small; it must be smaller than the\r\nremaining splinter of Gibraltar or Ceuta; otherwise, surely it would\r\nnever have escaped our observation.”\r\n\r\n“However small it may be,” replied Servadac, “we must find it. How far\r\noff do you suppose it is?”\r\n\r\n“It must be a hundred and twenty leagues away,” said the lieutenant,\r\nthoughtfully; “and I do not quite understand how you would propose to\r\nget there.”\r\n\r\n“Why, on skates of course; no difficulty in that, I should imagine,”\r\n answered Servadac, and he appealed to the count for confirmation of his\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe count assented, but Procope looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n“Your enterprise is generous,” he said, “and I should be most unwilling\r\nto throw any unnecessary obstacle in the way of its execution; but,\r\npardon me, if I submit to you a few considerations which to my mind\r\nare very important. First of all, the thermometer is already down to\r\n22 degrees below zero, and the keen wind from the south is making the\r\ntemperature absolutely unendurable; in the second place, supposing you\r\ntravel at the rate of twenty leagues a day, you would be exposed for\r\nat least six consecutive days; and thirdly, your expedition will be of\r\nsmall avail unless you convey provisions not only for yourselves, but\r\nfor those whom you hope to relieve.”\r\n\r\n“We can carry our own provisions on our backs in knapsacks,” interposed\r\nServadac, quickly, unwilling to recognize any difficulty in the way.\r\n\r\n“Granted that you can,” answered the lieutenant, quietly; “but where, on\r\nthis level ice-field, will you find shelter in your periods of rest?\r\nYou must perish with cold; you will not have the chance of digging out\r\nice-huts like the Esquimaux.”\r\n\r\n“As to rest,” said Servadac, “we shall take none; we shall keep on our\r\nway continuously; by traveling day and night without intermission, we\r\nshall not be more than three days in reaching Formentera.”\r\n\r\n“Believe me,” persisted the lieutenant, calmly, “your enthusiasm is\r\ncarrying you too far; the feat you propose is impossible; but even\r\nconceding the possibility of your success in reaching your destination,\r\nwhat service do you imagine that you, half-starved and half-frozen\r\nyourself, could render to those who are already perishing by want and\r\nexposure? you would only bring them away to die.”\r\n\r\nThe obvious and dispassionate reasoning of the lieutenant could not fail\r\nto impress the minds of those who listened to him; the impracticability\r\nof the journey became more and more apparent; unprotected on that drear\r\nexpanse, any traveler must assuredly succumb to the snow-drifts that\r\nwere continually being whirled across it. But Hector Servadac, animated\r\nby the generous desire of rescuing a suffering fellow-creature, could\r\nscarcely be brought within the bounds of common sense. Against his\r\nbetter judgment he was still bent upon the expedition, and Ben Zoof\r\ndeclared himself ready to accompany his master in the event of Count\r\nTimascheff hesitating to encounter the peril which the undertaking\r\ninvolved. But the count entirely repudiated all idea of shrinking from\r\nwhat, quite as much as the captain, he regarded as a sacred duty, and\r\nturning to Lieutenant Procope, told him that unless some better plan\r\ncould be devised, he was prepared to start off at once and make the\r\nattempt to skate across to Formentera. The lieutenant, who was lost in\r\nthought, made no immediate reply.\r\n\r\n“I wish we had a sledge,” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“I dare say that a sledge of some sort could be contrived,” said the\r\ncount; “but then we should have no dogs or reindeers to draw it.”\r\n\r\n“Why not rough-shoe the two horses?”\r\n\r\n“They would never be able to endure the cold,” objected the count.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Servadac, “let us get our sledge and put them to the\r\ntest. Something must be done!”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Lieutenant Procope, breaking his thoughtful silence,\r\n“that I can tell you of a sledge already provided for your hand, and I\r\ncan suggest a motive power surer and swifter than horses.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” was the eager inquiry.\r\n\r\n“I mean the _Dobryna_‘s yawl,” answered the lieutenant; “and I have no\r\ndoubt that the wind would carry her rapidly along the ice.”\r\n\r\nThe idea seemed admirable. Lieutenant Procope was well aware to what\r\nmarvelous perfection the Americans had brought their sail-sledges, and\r\nhad heard how in the vast prairies of the United States they had been\r\nknown to outvie the speed of an express train, occasionally attaining\r\na rate of more than a hundred miles an hour. The wind was still blowing\r\nhard from the south, and assuming that the yawl could be propelled\r\nwith a velocity of about fifteen or at least twelve leagues an hour, he\r\nreckoned that it was quite possible to reach Formentera within twelve\r\nhours, that is to say, in a single day between the intervals of sunrise\r\nand sunrise.\r\n\r\nThe yawl was about twelve feet long, and capable of holding five or six\r\npeople. The addition of a couple of iron runners would be all that was\r\nrequisite to convert it into an excellent sledge, which, if a sail\r\nwere hoisted, might be deemed certain to make a rapid progress over the\r\nsmooth surface of the ice. For the protection of the passengers it was\r\nproposed to erect a kind of wooden roof lined with strong cloth; beneath\r\nthis could be packed a supply of provisions, some warm furs, some\r\ncordials, and a portable stove to be heated by spirits of wine.\r\n\r\nFor the outward journey the wind was as favorable as could be desired;\r\nbut it was to be apprehended that, unless the direction of the wind\r\nshould change, the return would be a matter of some difficulty; a system\r\nof tacking might be carried out to a certain degree, but it was not\r\nlikely that the yawl would answer her helm in any way corresponding to\r\nwhat would occur in the open sea. Captain Servadac, however, would not\r\nlisten to any representation of probable difficulties; the future, he\r\nsaid, must provide for itself.\r\n\r\nThe engineer and several of the sailors set vigorously to work, and\r\nbefore the close of the day the yawl was furnished with a pair of stout\r\niron runners, curved upwards in front, and fitted with a metal scull\r\ndesigned to assist in maintaining the directness of her course; the roof\r\nwas put on, and beneath it were stored the provisions, the wraps, and\r\nthe cooking utensils.\r\n\r\nA strong desire was expressed by Lieutenant Procope that he should be\r\nallowed to accompany Captain Servadac instead of Count Timascheff. It\r\nwas unadvisable for all three of them to go, as, in case of there being\r\nseveral persons to be rescued, the space at their command would be\r\nquite inadequate. The lieutenant urged that he was the most experienced\r\nseaman, and as such was best qualified to take command of the sledge\r\nand the management of the sails; and as it was not to be expected that\r\nServadac would resign his intention of going in person to relieve his\r\nfellow-countryman, Procope submitted his own wishes to the count. The\r\ncount was himself very anxious to have his share in the philanthropic\r\nenterprise, and demurred considerably to the proposal; he yielded,\r\nhowever, after a time, to Servadac’s representations that in the event\r\nof the expedition proving disastrous, the little colony would need his\r\nservices alike as governor and protector, and overcoming his reluctance\r\nto be left out of the perilous adventure, was prevailed upon to remain\r\nbehind for the general good of the community at Nina’s Hive.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the following morning, the 16th of April, Captain Servadac\r\nand the lieutenant took their places in the yawl. The thermometer was\r\nmore than 20 degrees below zero, and it was with deep emotion that their\r\ncompanions beheld them thus embarking upon the vast white plain. Ben\r\nZoof’s heart was too full for words; Count Timascheff could not forbear\r\npressing his two brave friends to his bosom; the Spaniards and the\r\nRussian sailors crowded round for a farewell shake of the hand, and\r\nlittle Nina, her great eyes flooded with tears, held up her face for a\r\nparting kiss. The sad scene was not permitted to be long. The sail was\r\nquickly hoisted, and the sledge, just as if it had expanded a huge white\r\nwing, was in a little while carried far away beyond the horizon.\r\n\r\nLight and unimpeded, the yawl scudded on with incredible speed. Two\r\nsails, a brigantine and a jib, were arranged to catch the wind to the\r\ngreatest advantage, and the travelers estimated that their progress\r\nwould be little under the rate of twelve leagues an hour. The motion of\r\ntheir novel vehicle was singularly gentle, the oscillation being less\r\nthan that of an ordinary railway-carriage, while the diminished force of\r\ngravity contributed to the swiftness. Except that the clouds of ice-dust\r\nraised by the metal runners were an evidence that they had not actually\r\nleft the level surface of the ice, the captain and lieutenant might\r\nagain and again have imagined that they were being conveyed through the\r\nair in a balloon.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope, with his head all muffled up for fear of frost-bite,\r\ntook an occasional peep through an aperture that had been intentionally\r\nleft in the roof, and by the help of a compass, maintained a proper and\r\nstraight course for Formentera. Nothing could be more dejected than the\r\naspect of that frozen sea; not a single living creature relieved the\r\nsolitude; both the travelers, Procope from a scientific point of view,\r\nServadac from an aesthetic, were alike impressed by the solemnity of the\r\nscene, and where the lengthened shadow of the sail cast upon the ice by\r\nthe oblique rays of the setting sun had disappeared, and day had\r\ngiven place to night, the two men, drawn together as by an involuntary\r\nimpulse, mutually held each other’s hands in silence.\r\n\r\nThere had been a new moon on the previous evening; but, in the absence\r\nof moonlight, the constellations shone with remarkable brilliancy.\r\nThe new pole-star close upon the horizon was resplendent, and even had\r\nLieutenant Procope been destitute of a compass, he would have had no\r\ndifficulty in holding his course by the guidance of that alone. However\r\ngreat was the distance that separated Gallia from the sun, it was after\r\nall manifestly insignificant in comparison with the remoteness of the\r\nnearest of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nObserving that Servadac was completely absorbed in his own thoughts,\r\nLieutenant Procope had leisure to contemplate some of the present\r\nperplexing problems, and to ponder over the true astronomical position.\r\nThe last of the three mysterious documents had represented that Gallia,\r\nin conformity with Kepler’s second law, had traveled along her orbit\r\nduring the month of March twenty millions of leagues less than she had\r\ndone in the previous month; yet, in the same time, her distance from the\r\nsun had nevertheless been increased by thirty-two millions of leagues.\r\nShe was now, therefore, in the center of the zone of telescopic planets\r\nthat revolve between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and had captured\r\nfor herself a satellite which, according to the document, was Nerina,\r\none of the asteroids most recently identified. If thus, then, it was\r\nwithin the power of the unknown writer to estimate with such apparent\r\ncertainty Gallia’s exact position, was it not likely that his\r\nmathematical calculations would enable him to arrive at some definite\r\nconclusion as to the date at which she would begin again to approach the\r\nsun? Nay, was it not to be expected that he had already estimated, with\r\nsufficient approximation to truth, what was to be the true length of the\r\nGallian year?\r\n\r\nSo intently had they each separately been following their own train of\r\nthought, that daylight reappeared almost before the travelers were aware\r\nof it. On consulting their instruments, they found that they must have\r\ntraveled close upon a hundred leagues since they started, and they\r\nresolved to slacken their speed. The sails were accordingly taken in\r\na little, and in spite of the intensity of the cold, the explorers\r\nventured out of their shelter, in order that they might reconnoiter\r\nthe plain, which was apparently as boundless as ever. It was completely\r\ndesert; not so much as a single point of rock relieved the bare\r\nuniformity of its surface.\r\n\r\n“Are we not considerably to the west of Formentera?” asked Servadac,\r\nafter examining the chart.\r\n\r\n“Most likely,” replied Procope. “I have taken the same course as I\r\nshould have done at sea, and I have kept some distance to windward of\r\nthe island; we can bear straight down upon it whenever we like.”\r\n\r\n“Bear down then, now; and as quickly as you can.”\r\n\r\nThe yawl was at once put with her head to the northeast and Captain\r\nServadac, in defiance of the icy blast, remained standing at the bow,\r\nhis gaze fixed on the horizon.\r\n\r\nAll at once his eye brightened.\r\n\r\n“Look! look!” he exclaimed, pointing to a faint outline that broke the\r\nmonotony of the circle that divided the plain from the sky.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the lieutenant had seized his telescope.\r\n\r\n“I see what you mean,” said he; “it is a pylone that has been used for\r\nsome geodesic survey.”\r\n\r\nThe next moment the sail was filled, and the yawl was bearing down upon\r\nthe object with inconceivable swiftness, both Captain Servadac and the\r\nlieutenant too excited to utter a word. Mile after mile the distance\r\nrapidly grew less, and as they drew nearer the pylone they could\r\nsee that it was erected on a low mass of rocks that was the sole\r\ninterruption to the dull level of the field of ice. No wreath of\r\nsmoke rose above the little island; it was manifestly impossible, they\r\nconceived, that any human being could there have survived the cold; the\r\nsad presentiment forced itself upon their minds that it was a mere cairn\r\nto which they had been hurrying.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, and they were so near the rock that the lieutenant\r\ntook in his sail, convinced that the impetus already attained would\r\nbe sufficient to carry him to the land. Servadac’s heart bounded as he\r\ncaught sight of a fragment of blue canvas fluttering in the wind from\r\nthe top of the pylone: it was all that now remained of the French\r\nnational standard. At the foot of the pylone stood a miserable shed, its\r\nshutters tightly closed. No other habitation was to be seen; the entire\r\nisland was less than a quarter of a mile in circumference; and the\r\nconclusion was irresistible that it was the sole surviving remnant of\r\nFormentera, once a member of the Balearic Archipelago.\r\n\r\nTo leap on shore, to clamber over the slippery stones, and to reach the\r\ncabin was but the work of a few moments. The worm-eaten door was bolted\r\non the inside. Servadac began to knock with all his might. No answer.\r\nNeither shouting nor knocking could draw forth a reply.\r\n\r\n“Let us force it open, Procope!” he said.\r\n\r\nThe two men put their shoulders to the door, which soon yielded to their\r\nvigorous efforts, and they found themselves inside the shed, and in\r\nalmost total darkness. By opening a shutter they admitted what daylight\r\nthey could. At first sight the wretched place seemed to be deserted; the\r\nlittle grate contained the ashes of a fire long since extinguished; all\r\nlooked black and desolate. Another instant’s investigation, however,\r\nrevealed a bed in the extreme corner, and extended on the bed a human\r\nform.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” sighed Servadac; “dead of cold and hunger!”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope bent down and anxiously contemplated the body.\r\n\r\n“No; he is alive!” he said, and drawing a small flask from his pocket he\r\npoured a few drops of brandy between the lips of the senseless man.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint sigh, followed by a feeble voice, which uttered the\r\none word, “Gallia?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes! Gallia!” echoed Servadac, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“My comet, my comet!” said the voice, so low as to be almost inaudible,\r\nand the unfortunate man relapsed again into unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n“Where have I seen this man?” thought Servadac to himself; “his face is\r\nstrangely familiar to me.”\r\n\r\nBut it was no time for deliberation. Not a moment was to be lost in\r\ngetting the unconscious astronomer away from his desolate quarters.\r\nHe was soon conveyed to the yawl; his books, his scanty wardrobe, his\r\npapers, his instruments, and the blackboard which had served for\r\nhis calculations, were quickly collected; the wind, by a fortuitous\r\nProvidence, had shifted into a favorable quarter; they set their sail\r\nwith all speed, and ere long were on their journey back from Formentera.\r\n\r\nThirty-six hours later, the brave travelers were greeted by the\r\nacclamations of their fellow-colonists, who had been most anxiously\r\nawaiting their reappearance, and the still senseless _savant_, who had\r\nneither opened his eyes nor spoken a word throughout the journey, was\r\nsafely deposited in the warmth and security of the great hall of Nina’s\r\nHive.\r\n\r\nEND OF FIRST BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE ASTRONOMER\r\n\r\nBy the return of the expedition, conveying its contribution from\r\nFormentera, the known population of Gallia was raised to a total of\r\nthirty-six.\r\n\r\nOn learning the details of his friends’ discoveries, Count Timascheff\r\ndid not hesitate in believing that the exhausted individual who was\r\nlying before him was the author alike of the two unsigned documents\r\npicked up at sea, and of the third statement so recently brought to hand\r\nby the carrier-pigeon. Manifestly, he had arrived at some knowledge of\r\nGallia’s movements: he had estimated her distance from the sun; he had\r\ncalculated the diminution of her tangential speed; but there was nothing\r\nto show that he had arrived at the conclusions which were of the most\r\nparamount interest to them all. Had he ascertained the true character of\r\nher orbit? had he established any data from which it would be possible\r\nto reckon what time must elapse before she would again approach the\r\nearth?\r\n\r\nThe only intelligible words which the astronomer had uttered had been,\r\n“My comet!”\r\n\r\nTo what could the exclamation refer? Was it to be conjectured that a\r\nfragment of the earth had been chipped off by the collision of a comet?\r\nand if so, was it implied that the name of the comet itself was Gallia,\r\nand were they mistaken in supposing that such was the name given by the\r\n_savant_ to the little world that had been so suddenly launched\r\ninto space? Again and again they discussed these questions; but no\r\nsatisfactory answer could be found. The only man who was able to throw\r\nany light upon the subject was lying amongst them in an unconscious and\r\nhalf-dying condition.\r\n\r\nApart from motives of humanity, motives of self-interest made it a\r\nmatter of the deepest concern to restore animation to that senseless\r\nform. Ben Zoof, after making the encouraging remark that _savants_ have\r\nas many lives as a cat, proceeded, with Negrete’s assistance, to give\r\nthe body such a vigorous rubbing as would have threatened serious\r\ninjury to any ordinary mortal, whilst they administered cordials and\r\nrestoratives from the _Dobryna’s_ medical stores powerful enough, one\r\nmight think, to rouse the very dead.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the captain was racking his brain in his exertions to recall\r\nwhat were the circumstances of his previous acquaintance with the\r\nFrenchman upon whose features he was gazing; he only grew more and more\r\nconvinced that he had once been familiar with them. Perhaps it was not\r\naltogether surprising that he had almost forgotten him; he had never\r\nseen him since the days of his youth, that time of life which, with a\r\ncertain show of justice, has been termed the age of ingratitude; for,\r\nin point of fact, the astronomer was none other than Professor Palmyrin\r\nRosette, Servadac’s old science-master at the Lycee Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nAfter completing his year of elementary studies, Hector Servadac had\r\nentered the school at Saint Cyr, and from that time he and his former\r\ntutor had never met, so that naturally they would well-nigh pass from\r\neach other’s recollection. One thing, however, on the other hand, might\r\nconduce to a mutual and permanent impression on their memories; during\r\nthe year at the Lycee, young Servadac, never of a very studious turn\r\nof mind, had contrived, as the ringleader of a set of like caliber as\r\nhimself, to lead the poor professor a life of perpetual torment. On the\r\ndiscovery of each delinquency he would fume and rage in a manner that\r\nwas a source of unbounded delight to his audience.\r\n\r\nTwo years after Servadac left the Lycee, Professor Rosette had thrown\r\nup all educational employment in order that he might devote himself\r\nentirely to the study of astronomy. He endeavored to obtain a post\r\nat the Observatory, but his ungenial character was so well known in\r\nscientific circles that he failed in his application; however, having\r\nsome small private means, he determined on his own account to carry on\r\nhis researches without any official salary. He had really considerable\r\ngenius for the science that he had adopted; besides discovering three of\r\nthe latest of the telescopic planets, he had worked out the elements of\r\nthe three hundred and twenty-fifth comet in the catalogue; but his chief\r\ndelight was to criticize the publications of other astronomers, and\r\nhe was never better pleased than when he detected a flaw in their\r\nreckonings.\r\n\r\nWhen Ben Zoof and Negrete had extricated their patient from the envelope\r\nof furs in which he had been wrapped by Servadac and the lieutenant,\r\nthey found themselves face to face with a shrivelled little man, about\r\nfive feet two inches high, with a round bald head, smooth and shiny as\r\nan ostrich’s egg, no beard unless the unshorn growth of a week could\r\nbe so described, and a long hooked nose that supported a huge pair of\r\nspectacles such as with many near-sighted people seems to have become\r\na part of their individuality. His nervous system was remarkably\r\ndeveloped, and his body might not inaptly be compared to one of the\r\nRhumkorff’s bobbins of which the thread, several hundred yards in\r\nlength, is permeated throughout by electric fluid. But whatever he was,\r\nhis life, if possible, must be preserved. When he had been partially\r\ndivested of his clothing, his heart was found to be still beating,\r\nthough very feebly. Asserting that while there was life there was hope,\r\nBen Zoof recommenced his friction with more vigor than ever.\r\n\r\nWhen the rubbing had been continued without a moment’s intermission for\r\nthe best part of half an hour, the astronomer heaved a faint sigh, which\r\nere long was followed by another and another. He half opened his eyes,\r\nclosed them again, then opened them completely, but without exhibiting\r\nany consciousness whatever of his situation. A few words seemed to\r\nescape his lips, but they were quite unintelligible. Presently he raised\r\nhis right hand to his forehead as though instinctively feeling for\r\nsomething that was missing; then, all of a sudden, his features became\r\ncontracted, his face flushed with apparent irritation, and he exclaimed\r\nfretfully, “My spectacles!--where are my spectacles?”\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate his operations, Ben Zoof had removed the\r\nspectacles in spite of the tenacity with which they seemed to adhere\r\nto the temples of his patient; but he now rapidly brought them back\r\nand readjusted them as best he could to what seemed to be their natural\r\nposition on the aquiline nose. The professor heaved a long sigh of\r\nrelief, and once more closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nBefore long the astronomer roused himself a little more, and glanced\r\ninquiringly about him, but soon relapsed into his comatose condition.\r\nWhen next he opened his eyes, Captain Servadac happened to be bending\r\ndown closely over him, examining his features with curious scrutiny.\r\nThe old man darted an angry look at him through the spectacles, and said\r\nsharply, “Servadac, five hundred lines to-morrow!”\r\n\r\nIt was an echo of days of old. The words were few, but they were enough\r\nto recall the identity which Servadac was trying to make out.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” he exclaimed. “Here is my old tutor, Mr. Rosette, in\r\nvery flesh and blood.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t say much for the flesh,” muttered Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\nThe old man had again fallen back into a torpid slumber. Ben Zoof\r\ncontinued, “His sleep is getting more composed. Let him alone; he will\r\ncome round yet. Haven’t I heard of men more dried up than he is, being\r\nbrought all the way from Egypt in cases covered with pictures?”\r\n\r\n“You idiot!--those were mummies; they had been dead for ages.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof did not answer a word. He went on preparing a warm bed, into\r\nwhich he managed to remove his patient, who soon fell into a calm and\r\nnatural sleep.\r\n\r\nToo impatient to await the awakening of the astronomer and to hear what\r\nrepresentations he had to make, Servadac, the count, and the lieutenant,\r\nconstituting themselves what might be designated “the Academy of\r\nSciences” of the colony, spent the whole of the remainder of the day in\r\nstarting and discussing the wildest conjectures about their situation.\r\nThe hypothesis, to which they had now accustomed themselves for so\r\nlong, that a new asteroid had been formed by a fracture of the earth’s\r\nsurface, seemed to fall to the ground when they found that Professor\r\nPalmyrin Rosette had associated the name of Gallia, not with their\r\npresent home, but with what he called “my comet”; and that theory being\r\nabandoned, they were driven to make the most improbable speculations to\r\nreplace it.\r\n\r\nAlluding to Rosette, Servadac took care to inform his companions\r\nthat, although the professor was always eccentric, and at times very\r\nirascible, yet he was really exceedingly good-hearted; his bark was\r\nworse than his bite; and if suffered to take their course without\r\nobservation, his outbreaks of ill-temper seldom lasted long.\r\n\r\n“We will certainly do our best to get on with him,” said the count. “He\r\nis no doubt the author of the papers, and we must hope that he will be\r\nable to give us some valuable information.”\r\n\r\n“Beyond a question the documents have originated with him,” assented\r\nthe lieutenant. “Gallia was the word written at the top of every one of\r\nthem, and Gallia was the first word uttered by him in our hearing.”\r\n\r\nThe astronomer slept on. Meanwhile, the three together had no\r\nhesitation in examining his papers, and scrutinizing the figures on his\r\nextemporized blackboard. The handwriting corresponded with that of the\r\npapers already received; the blackboard was covered with algebraical\r\nsymbols traced in chalk, which they were careful not to obliterate;\r\nand the papers, which consisted for the most part of detached scraps,\r\npresented a perfect wilderness of geometrical figures, conic sections of\r\nevery variety being repeated in countless profusion.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope pointed out that these curves evidently had reference\r\nto the orbits of comets, which are variously parabolic, hyperbolic, or\r\nelliptic. If either of the first two, the comet, after once appearing\r\nwithin the range of terrestrial vision, would vanish forever in the\r\noutlying regions of space; if the last, it would be sure, sooner or\r\nlater, after some periodic interval, to return.\r\n\r\nFrom the _prima facie_ appearance of his papers, then, it seemed\r\nprobable that the astronomer, during his sojourn at Formentera, had been\r\ndevoting himself to the study of cometary orbits; and as calculations of\r\nthis kind are ordinarily based upon the assumption that the orbit is a\r\nparabola, it was not unlikely that he had been endeavoring to trace the\r\npath of some particular comet.\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether these calculations were made before or after the 1st\r\nof January; it makes all the difference,” said Lieutenant Procope.\r\n\r\n“We must bide our time and hear,” replied the count.\r\n\r\nServadac paced restlessly up and down. “I would give a month of my\r\nlife,” he cried, impetuously, “for every hour that the old fellow goes\r\nsleeping on.”\r\n\r\n“You might be making a bad bargain,” said Procope, smiling. “Perhaps\r\nafter all the comet has had nothing to do with the convulsion that we\r\nhave experienced.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed the captain; “I know better than that, and so do\r\nyou. Is it not as clear as daylight that the earth and this comet have\r\nbeen in collision, and the result has been that our little world has\r\nbeen split off and sent flying far into space?”\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff and the lieutenant looked at each other in silence. “I\r\ndo not deny your theory,” said Procope after a while. “If it be correct,\r\nI suppose we must conclude that the enormous disc we observed on the\r\nnight of the catastrophe was the comet itself; and the velocity with\r\nwhich it was traveling must have been so great that it was hardly\r\narrested at all by the attraction of the earth.”\r\n\r\n“Plausible enough,” answered Count Timascheff; “and it is to this comet\r\nthat our scientific friend here has given the name of Gallia.”\r\n\r\nIt still remained a puzzle to them all why the astronomer should\r\napparently be interested in the comet so much more than in the new\r\nlittle world in which their strange lot was cast.\r\n\r\n“Can you explain this?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n“There is no accounting for the freaks of philosophers, you know,” said\r\nServadac; “and have I not told you that this philosopher in particular\r\nis one of the most eccentric beings in creation?”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” added the lieutenant, “it is exceedingly likely that his\r\nobservations had been going on for some considerable period before the\r\nconvulsion happened.”\r\n\r\nThus, the general conclusion arrived at by the Gallian Academy of\r\nScience was this: That on the night of the 31st of December, a comet,\r\ncrossing the ecliptic, had come into collision with the earth, and that\r\nthe violence of the shock had separated a huge fragment from the\r\nglobe, which fragment from that date had been traversing the remote\r\ninter-planetary regions. Palmyrin Rosette would doubtless confirm their\r\nsolution of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. A REVELATION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the general population of the colony the arrival of the stranger was\r\na matter of small interest. The Spaniards were naturally too indolent\r\nto be affected in any way by an incident that concerned themselves so\r\nremotely; while the Russians felt themselves simply reliant on their\r\nmaster, and as long as they were with him were careless as to where or\r\nhow they spent their days. Everything went on with them in an accustomed\r\nroutine; and they lay down night after night, and awoke to their\r\navocations morning after morning, just as if nothing extraordinary had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nAll night long Ben Zoof would not leave the professor’s bedside. He had\r\nconstituted himself sick nurse, and considered his reputation at stake\r\nif he failed to set his patient on his feet again. He watched every\r\nmovement, listened to every breath, and never failed to administer\r\nthe strongest cordials upon the slightest pretext. Even in his sleep\r\nRosette’s irritable nature revealed itself. Ever and again, sometimes\r\nin a tone of uneasiness, and sometimes with the expression of positive\r\nanger, the name of Gallia escaped his lips, as though he were dreaming\r\nthat his claim to the discovery of the comet was being contested or\r\ndenied; but although his attendant was on the alert to gather all he\r\ncould, he was able to catch nothing in the incoherent sentences that\r\nserved to throw any real light upon the problem that they were all eager\r\nto solve.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun reappeared on the western horizon the professor was still\r\nsound asleep; and Ben Zoof, who was especially anxious that the repose\r\nwhich promised to be so beneficial should not be disturbed, felt\r\nconsiderable annoyance at hearing a loud knocking, evidently of some\r\nblunt heavy instrument against a door that had been placed at the\r\nentrance of the gallery, more for the purpose of retaining internal\r\nwarmth than for guarding against intrusion from without.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” said Ben Zoof. “I must put a stop to this;” and he made\r\nhis way towards the door.\r\n\r\n“Who’s there?” he cried, in no very amiable tone.\r\n\r\n“I.” replied the quavering voice.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Isaac Hakkabut. Let me in; do, please, let me in.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is you, old Ashtaroth, is it? What do you want? Can’t you get\r\nanybody to buy your stuffs?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody will pay me a proper price.”\r\n\r\n“Well, old Shimei, you won’t find a customer here. You had better be\r\noff.”\r\n\r\n“No; but do, please--do, please, let me in,” supplicated the Jew. “I\r\nwant to speak to his Excellency, the governor.”\r\n\r\n“The governor is in bed, and asleep.”\r\n\r\n“I can wait until he awakes.”\r\n\r\n“Then wait where you are.”\r\n\r\nAnd with this inhospitable rejoinder the orderly was about to return to\r\nhis place at the side of his patient, when Servadac, who had been roused\r\nby the sound of voices, called out, “What’s the matter, Ben Zoof?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing, sir; only that hound of a Hakkabut says he wants to speak\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\n“Let him in, then.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Let him in, I say,” repeated the captain, peremptorily.\r\n\r\nHowever reluctantly, Ben Zoof obeyed. The door was unfastened, and Isaac\r\nHakkabut, enveloped in an old overcoat, shuffled into the gallery. In a\r\nfew moments Servadac approached, and the Jew began to overwhelm him with\r\nthe most obsequious epithets. Without vouchsafing any reply, the captain\r\nbeckoned to the old man to follow him, and leading the way to the\r\ncentral hall, stopped, and turning so as to look him steadily in the\r\nface, said, “Now is your opportunity. Tell me what you want.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my lord, my lord,” whined Isaac, “you must have some news to tell\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“News? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“From my little tartan yonder, I saw the yawl go out from the rock here\r\non a journey, and I saw it come back, and it brought a stranger; and I\r\nthought--I thought--I thought--”\r\n\r\n“Well, you thought--what did you think?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that perhaps the stranger had come from the northern shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and that I might ask him--”\r\n\r\nHe paused again, and gave a glance at the captain.\r\n\r\n“Ask him what? Speak out, man?”\r\n\r\n“Ask him if he brings any tidings of Europe,” Hakkabut blurted out at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nServadac shrugged his shoulders in contempt and turned away. Here was\r\na man who had been resident three months in Gallia, a living witness\r\nof all the abnormal phenomena that had occurred, and yet refusing to\r\nbelieve that his hope of making good bargains with European traders was\r\nat an end. Surely nothing, thought the captain, will convince the old\r\nrascal now; and he moved off in disgust. The orderly, however, who\r\nhad listened with much amusement, was by no means disinclined for the\r\nconversation to be continued. “Are you satisfied, old Ezekiel?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it so? Am I not right? Didn’t a stranger arrive here last night?”\r\n inquired the Jew.\r\n\r\n“Yes, quite true.”\r\n\r\n“Where from?”\r\n\r\n“From the Balearic Isles.”\r\n\r\n“The Balearic Isles?” echoed Isaac.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Fine quarters for trade! Hardly twenty leagues from Spain! He must have\r\nbrought news from Europe!”\r\n\r\n“Well, old Manasseh, what if he has?”\r\n\r\n“I should like to see him.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t be.”\r\n\r\nThe Jew sidled close up to Ben Zoof, and laying his hand on his arm,\r\nsaid in a low and insinuating tone, “I am poor, you know; but I would\r\ngive you a few reals if you would let me talk to this stranger.”\r\n\r\nBut as if he thought he was making too liberal an offer, he added, “Only\r\nit must be at once.”\r\n\r\n“He is too tired; he is worn out; he is fast asleep,” answered Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“But I would pay you to wake him.”\r\n\r\nThe captain had overheard the tenor of the conversation, and interposed\r\nsternly, “Hakkabut! if you make the least attempt to disturb our\r\nvisitor, I shall have you turned outside that door immediately.”\r\n\r\n“No offense, my lord, I hope,” stammered out the Jew. “I only meant--”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” shouted Servadac. The old man hung his head, abashed.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you what,” said Servadac after a brief interval; “I will\r\ngive you leave to hear what this stranger has to tell as soon as he is\r\nable to tell us anything; at present we have not heard a word from his\r\nlips.”\r\n\r\nThe Jew looked perplexed.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Servadac; “when we hear his story, you shall hear it too.”\r\n\r\n“And I hope it will be to your liking, old Ezekiel!” added Ben Zoof in a\r\nvoice of irony.\r\n\r\nThey had none of them long to wait, for within a few minutes Rosette’s\r\npeevish voice was heard calling, “Joseph! Joseph!”\r\n\r\nThe professor did not open his eyes, and appeared to be slumbering on,\r\nbut very shortly afterwards called out again, “Joseph! Confound the\r\nfellow! where is he?” It was evident that he was half dreaming about\r\na former servant now far away on the ancient globe. “Where’s my\r\nblackboard, Joseph?”\r\n\r\n“Quite safe, sir,” answered Ben Zoof, quickly.\r\n\r\nRosette unclosed his eyes and fixed them full upon the orderly’s face.\r\n“Are you Joseph?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“At your service, sir,” replied Ben Zoof with imperturbable gravity.\r\n\r\n“Then get me my coffee, and be quick about it.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof left to go into the kitchen, and Servadac approached the\r\nprofessor in order to assist him in rising to a sitting posture.\r\n\r\n“Do you recognize your quondam pupil, professor?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, yes; you are Servadac,” replied Rosette. “It is twelve years\r\nor more since I saw you; I hope you have improved.”\r\n\r\n“Quite a reformed character, sir, I assure you,” said Servadac, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s as it should be; that’s right,” said the astronomer with\r\nfussy importance. “But let me have my coffee,” he added impatiently; “I\r\ncannot collect my thoughts without my coffee.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, Ben Zoof appeared with a great cup, hot and strong. After\r\ndraining it with much apparent relish, the professor got out of bed,\r\nwalked into the common hall, round which he glanced with a pre-occupied\r\nair, and proceeded to seat himself in an armchair, the most comfortable\r\nwhich the cabin of the _Dobryna_ had supplied. Then, in a voice full\r\nof satisfaction, and that involuntarily recalled the exclamations of\r\ndelight that had wound up the two first of the mysterious documents that\r\nhad been received, he burst out, “Well, gentlemen, what do you think of\r\nGallia?”\r\n\r\nThere was no time for anyone to make a reply before Isaac Hakkabut had\r\ndarted forward.\r\n\r\n“By the God--”\r\n\r\n“Who is that?” asked the startled professor; and he frowned, and made a\r\ngesture of repugnance.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the efforts that were made to silence him, the Jew\r\ncontinued, “By the God of Abraham, I beseech you, give me some tidings\r\nof Europe!”\r\n\r\n“Europe?” shouted the professor, springing from his seat as if he were\r\nelectrified; “what does the man want with Europe?”\r\n\r\n“I want to get there!” screeched the Jew; and in spite of every exertion\r\nto get him away, he clung most tenaciously to the professor’s chair, and\r\nagain and again implored for news of Europe.\r\n\r\nRosette made no immediate reply. After a moment or two’s reflection, he\r\nturned to Servadac and asked him whether it was not the middle of April.\r\n\r\n“It is the twentieth,” answered the captain.\r\n\r\n“Then to-day,” said the astronomer, speaking with the greatest\r\ndeliberation--“to-day we are just three millions of leagues away from\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\nThe Jew was utterly crestfallen.\r\n\r\n“You seem here,” continued the professor, “to be very ignorant of the\r\nstate of things.”\r\n\r\n“How far we are ignorant,” rejoined Servadac, “I cannot tell. But I will\r\ntell you all that we do know, and all that we have surmised.” And\r\nas briefly as he could, he related all that had happened since\r\nthe memorable night of the thirty-first of December; how they had\r\nexperienced the shock; how the _Dobryna_ had made her voyage; how they\r\nhad discovered nothing except the fragments of the old continent at\r\nTunis, Sardinia, Gibraltar, and now at Formentera; how at intervals\r\nthe three anonymous documents had been received; and, finally, how\r\nthe settlement at Gourbi Island had been abandoned for their present\r\nquarters at Nina’s Hive.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer had hardly patience to hear him to the end. “And what do\r\nyou say is your surmise as to your present position?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Our supposition,” the captain replied, “is this. We imagine that we\r\nare on a considerable fragment of the terrestrial globe that has been\r\ndetached by collision with a planet to which you appear to have given\r\nthe name of Gallia.”\r\n\r\n“Better than that!” cried Rosette, starting to his feet with excitement.\r\n\r\n“How? Why? What do you mean?” cried the voices of the listeners.\r\n\r\n“You are correct to a certain degree,” continued the professor. “It is\r\nquite true that at 47’ 35.6” after two o’clock on the morning of the\r\nfirst of January there was a collision; my comet grazed the earth; and\r\nthe bits of the earth which you have named were carried clean away.”\r\n\r\nThey were all fairly bewildered.\r\n\r\n“Where, then,” cried Servadac eagerly, “where are we?”\r\n\r\n“You are on my comet, on Gallia itself!”\r\n\r\nAnd the professor gazed around him with a perfect air of triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE PROFESSOR’S EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, my comet!” repeated the professor, and from time to time he\r\nknitted his brows, and looked around him with a defiant air, as though\r\nhe could not get rid of the impression that someone was laying an\r\nunwarranted claim to its proprietorship, or that the individuals before\r\nhim were intruders upon his own proper domain.\r\n\r\nBut for a considerable while, Servadac, the count, and the lieutenant\r\nremained silent and sunk in thought. Here then, at last, was the\r\nunriddling of the enigma they had been so long endeavoring to solve;\r\nboth the hypotheses they had formed in succession had now to give way\r\nbefore the announcement of the real truth. The first supposition, that\r\nthe rotatory axis of the earth had been subject to some accidental\r\nmodification, and the conjecture that replaced it, namely, that a\r\ncertain portion of the terrestrial sphere had been splintered off and\r\ncarried into space, had both now to yield to the representation that\r\nthe earth had been grazed by an unknown comet, which had caught up some\r\nscattered fragments from its surface, and was bearing them far away into\r\nsidereal regions. Unfolded lay the past and the present before them; but\r\nthis only served to awaken a keener interest about the future. Could the\r\nprofessor throw any light upon that? they longed to inquire, but did not\r\nyet venture to ask him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Rosette assumed a pompous professional air, and appeared to\r\nbe waiting for the entire party to be ceremoniously introduced to him.\r\nNothing unwilling to humor the vanity of the eccentric little man,\r\nServadac proceeded to go through the expected formalities.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to present to you my excellent friend, the Count Timascheff,”\r\n he said.\r\n\r\n“You are very welcome,” said Rosette, bowing to the count with a smile\r\nof condescension.\r\n\r\n“Although I am not precisely a voluntary resident on your comet, Mr.\r\nProfessor, I beg to acknowledge your courteous reception,” gravely\r\nresponded Timascheff.\r\n\r\nServadac could not quite conceal his amusement at the count’s irony, but\r\ncontinued, “This is Lieutenant Procope, the officer in command of the\r\n_Dobryna_.”\r\n\r\nThe professor bowed again in frigid dignity.\r\n\r\n“His yacht has conveyed us right round Gallia,” added the captain.\r\n\r\n“Round Gallia?” eagerly exclaimed the professor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, entirely round it,” answered Servadac, and without allowing time\r\nfor reply, proceeded, “And this is my orderly, Ben Zoof.”\r\n\r\n“Aide-de-camp to his Excellency the Governor of Gallia,” interposed Ben\r\nZoof himself, anxious to maintain his master’s honor as well as his own.\r\n\r\nRosette scarcely bent his head.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the population of the Hive were all presented in succession:\r\nthe Russian sailors, the Spaniards, young Pablo, and little Nina, on\r\nwhom the professor, evidently no lover of children, glared fiercely\r\nthrough his formidable spectacles. Isaac Hakkabut, after his\r\nintroduction, begged to be allowed to ask one question.\r\n\r\n“How soon may we hope to get back?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Get back!” rejoined Rosette, sharply; “who talks of getting back? We\r\nhave hardly started yet.”\r\n\r\nSeeing that the professor was inclined to get angry, Captain Servadac\r\nadroitly gave a new turn to the conversation by asking him whether\r\nhe would gratify them by relating his own recent experiences. The\r\nastronomer seemed pleased with the proposal, and at once commenced a\r\nverbose and somewhat circumlocutory address, of which the following\r\nsummary presents the main features.\r\n\r\nThe French Government, being desirous of verifying the measurement\r\nalready made of the arc of the meridian of Paris, appointed a scientific\r\ncommission for that purpose. From that commission the name of Palmyrin\r\nRosette was omitted, apparently for no other reason than his personal\r\nunpopularity. Furious at the slight, the professor resolved to set to\r\nwork independently on his own account, and declaring that there were\r\ninaccuracies in the previous geodesic operations, he determined to\r\nre-examine the results of the last triangulation which had united\r\nFormentera to the Spanish coast by a triangle, one of the sides of which\r\nmeasured over a hundred miles, the very operation which had already been\r\nso successfully accomplished by Arago and Biot.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, leaving Paris for the Balearic Isles, he placed his\r\nobservatory on the highest point of Formentera, and accompanied as he\r\nwas only by his servant, Joseph, led the life of a recluse. He secured\r\nthe services of a former assistant, and dispatched him to a high peak on\r\nthe coast of Spain, where he had to superintend a reverberator, which,\r\nwith the aid of a glass, could be seen from Formentera. A few books and\r\ninstruments, and two months’ victuals, was all the baggage he took with\r\nhim, except an excellent astronomical telescope, which was, indeed,\r\nalmost part and parcel of himself, and with which he assiduously scanned\r\nthe heavens, in the sanguine anticipation of making some discovery which\r\nwould immortalize his name.\r\n\r\nThe task he had undertaken demanded the utmost patience. Night after\r\nnight, in order to fix the apex of his triangle, he had to linger on the\r\nwatch for the assistant’s signal-light, but he did not forget that\r\nhis predecessors, Arago and Biot, had had to wait sixty-one days for a\r\nsimilar purpose. What retarded the work was the dense fog which, it has\r\nbeen already mentioned, at that time enveloped not only that part of\r\nEurope, but almost the entire world.\r\n\r\nNever failing to turn to the best advantage the few intervals when the\r\nmist lifted a little, the astronomer would at the same time cast an\r\ninquiring glance at the firmament, as he was greatly interested in the\r\nrevision of the chart of the heavens, in the region contiguous to the\r\nconstellation Gemini.\r\n\r\nTo the naked eye this constellation consists of only six stars, but\r\nthrough a telescope ten inches in diameter, as many as six thousand\r\nare visible. Rosette, however, did not possess a reflector of this\r\nmagnitude, and was obliged to content himself with the good but\r\ncomparatively small instrument he had.\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions, whilst carefully gauging the recesses of\r\nGemini, he espied a bright speck which was unregistered in the chart,\r\nand which at first he took for a small star that had escaped being\r\nentered in the catalogue. But the observation of a few separate nights\r\nsoon made it manifest that the star was rapidly changing its position\r\nwith regard to the adjacent stars, and the astronomer’s heart began to\r\nleap at the thought that the renown of the discovery of a new planet\r\nwould be associated with his name.\r\n\r\nRedoubling his attention, he soon satisfied himself that what he saw was\r\nnot a planet; the rapidity of its displacement rather forced him to\r\nthe conjecture that it must be a comet, and this opinion was soon\r\nstrengthened by the appearance of a coma, and subsequently confirmed, as\r\nthe body approached the sun, by the development of a tail.\r\n\r\nA comet! The discovery was fatal to all further progress in the\r\ntriangulation. However conscientiously the assistant on the Spanish\r\ncoast might look to the kindling of the beacon, Rosette had no glances\r\nto spare for that direction; he had no eyes except for the one object of\r\nhis notice, no thoughts apart from that one quarter of the firmament.\r\n\r\nA comet! No time must be lost in calculating its elements.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to calculate the elements of a comet, it is always deemed\r\nthe safest mode of procedure to assume the orbit to be a parabola.\r\nOrdinarily, comets are conspicuous at their perihelia, as being their\r\nshortest distances from the sun, which is the focus of their orbit,\r\nand inasmuch as a parabola is but an ellipse with its axis indefinitely\r\nproduced, for some short portion of its pathway the orbit may be\r\nindifferently considered either one or the other; but in this particular\r\ncase the professor was right in adopting the supposition of its being\r\nparabolic.\r\n\r\nJust as in a circle, it is necessary to know three points to determine\r\nthe circumference; so in ascertaining the elements of a comet, three\r\ndifferent positions must be observed before what astronomers call its\r\n“ephemeris” can be established.\r\n\r\nBut Professor Rosette did not content himself with three positions;\r\ntaking advantage of every rift in the fog he made ten, twenty, thirty\r\nobservations both in right ascension and in declination, and succeeded\r\nin working out with the most minute accuracy the five elements of the\r\ncomet which was evidently advancing with astounding rapidity towards the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThese elements were:\r\n\r\n1. The inclination of the plane of the cometary orbit to the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic, an angle which is generally considerable, but in this case\r\nthe planes were proved to coincide.\r\n\r\n2. The position of the ascending node, or the point where the comet\r\ncrossed the terrestrial orbit.\r\n\r\nThese two elements being obtained, the position in space of the comet’s\r\norbit was determined.\r\n\r\n3. The direction of the axis major of the orbit, which was found by\r\ncalculating the longitude of the comet’s perihelion.\r\n\r\n4. The perihelion distance from the sun, which settled the precise form\r\nof the parabola.\r\n\r\n5. The motion of the comet, as being retrograde, or, unlike the planets,\r\nfrom east to west.\r\n\r\nRosette thus found himself able to calculate the date at which the comet\r\nwould reach its perihelion, and, overjoyed at his discovery, without\r\nthinking of calling it Palmyra or Rosette, after his own name, he\r\nresolved that it should be known as Gallia.\r\n\r\nHis next business was to draw up a formal report. Not only did he at\r\nonce recognize that a collision with the earth was possible, but he soon\r\nforesaw that it was inevitable, and that it must happen on the night of\r\nthe 31st of December; moreover, as the bodies were moving in opposite\r\ndirections, the shock could hardly fail to be violent.\r\n\r\nTo say that he was elated at the prospect was far below the truth; his\r\ndelight amounted almost to delirium. Anyone else would have hurried from\r\nthe solitude of Formentera in sheer fright; but, without communicating\r\na word of his startling discovery, he remained resolutely at his post.\r\nFrom occasional newspapers which he had received, he had learnt that\r\nfogs, dense as ever, continued to envelop both hemispheres, so that\r\nhe was assured that the existence of the comet was utterly unknown\r\nelsewhere; and the ignorance of the world as to the peril that\r\nthreatened it averted the panic that would have followed the publication\r\nof the facts, and left the philosopher of Formentera in sole possession\r\nof the great secret. He clung to his post with the greater persistency,\r\nbecause his calculations had led him to the conclusion that the comet\r\nwould strike the earth somewhere to the south of Algeria, and as it had\r\na solid nucleus, he felt sure that, as he expressed it, the effect would\r\nbe “unique,” and he was anxious to be in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe shock came, and with it the results already recorded. Palmyrin\r\nRosette was suddenly separated from his servant Joseph, and when, after\r\na long period of unconsciousness, he came to himself, he found that\r\nhe was the solitary occupant of the only fragment that survived of the\r\nBalearic Archipelago.\r\n\r\nSuch was the substance of the narrative which the professor gave\r\nwith sundry repetitions and digressions; while he was giving it, he\r\nfrequently paused and frowned as if irritated in a way that seemed by\r\nno means justified by the patient and good-humored demeanor of his\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n“But now, gentlemen,” added the professor, “I must tell you something\r\nmore. Important changes have resulted from the collision; the cardinal\r\npoints have been displaced; gravity has been diminished: not that I ever\r\nsupposed for a minute, as you did, that I was still upon the earth. No!\r\nthe earth, attended by her moon, continued to rotate along her proper\r\norbit. But we, gentlemen, have nothing to complain of; our destiny might\r\nhave been far worse; we might all have been crushed to death, or the\r\ncomet might have remained in adhesion to the earth; and in neither of\r\nthese cases should we have had the satisfaction of making this marvelous\r\nexcursion through untraversed solar regions. No, gentlemen, I repeat it,\r\nwe have nothing to regret.”\r\n\r\nAnd as the professor spoke, he seemed to kindle with the emotion of such\r\nsupreme contentment that no one had the heart to gainsay his assertion.\r\nBen Zoof alone ventured an unlucky remark to the effect that if the\r\ncomet had happened to strike against Montmartre, instead of a bit of\r\nAfrica, it would have met with some resistance.\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” said Rosette, disdainfully. “A mole-hill like Montmartre would\r\nhave been ground to powder in a moment.”\r\n\r\n“Mole-hill!” exclaimed Ben Zoof, stung to the quick. “I can tell you it\r\nwould have caught up your bit of a comet and worn it like a feather in a\r\ncap.”\r\n\r\nThe professor looked angry, and Servadac having imposed silence upon\r\nhis orderly, explained the worthy soldier’s sensitiveness on all that\r\nconcerned Montmartre. Always obedient to his master, Ben Zoof held his\r\ntongue; but he felt that he could never forgive the slight that had been\r\ncast upon his beloved home.\r\n\r\nIt was now all-important to learn whether the astronomer had been able\r\nto continue his observations, and whether he had learned sufficient of\r\nGallia’s path through space to make him competent to determine, at least\r\napproximately, the period of its revolution round the sun. With as much\r\ntact and caution as he could, Lieutenant Procope endeavored to intimate\r\nthe general desire for some information on this point.\r\n\r\n“Before the shock, sir,” answered the professor, “I had conclusively\r\ndemonstrated the path of the comet; but, in consequence of the\r\nmodifications which that shock has entailed upon my comet’s orbit, I\r\nhave been compelled entirely to recommence my calculations.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant looked disappointed.\r\n\r\n“Although the orbit of the earth was unaltered,” continued the\r\nprofessor, “the result of the collision was the projection of the comet\r\ninto a new orbit altogether.”\r\n\r\n“And may I ask,” said Procope, deferentially, “whether you have got the\r\nelements of the fresh orbit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then perhaps you know--”\r\n\r\n“I know this, sir, that at 47 minutes 35.6 seconds after two o’clock on\r\nthe morning of the 1st of January last, Gallia, in passing its ascending\r\nnode, came in contact with the earth; that on the 10th of January it\r\ncrossed the orbit of Venus; that it reached its perihelion on the 15th;\r\nthat it re-crossed the orbit of Venus; that on the 1st of February\r\nit passed its descending node; on the 13th crossed the orbit of Mars;\r\nentered the zone of the telescopic planets on the 10th of March, and,\r\nattracting Nerina, carried it off as a satellite.”\r\n\r\nServadac interposed:\r\n\r\n“We are already acquainted with well-nigh all these extraordinary facts;\r\nmany of them, moreover, we have learned from documents which we have\r\npicked up, and which, although unsigned, we cannot entertain a doubt\r\nhave originated with you.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Rosette drew himself up proudly and said: “Of course, they\r\noriginated with me. I sent them off by hundreds. From whom else could\r\nthey come?”\r\n\r\n“From no one but yourself, certainly,” rejoined the count, with grave\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\nHitherto the conversation had thrown no light upon the future movements\r\nof Gallia, and Rosette was disposed apparently to evade, or at least to\r\npostpone, the subject. When, therefore, Lieutenant Procope was about to\r\npress his inquiries in a more categorical form, Servadac, thinking\r\nit advisable not prematurely to press the little _savant_ too far,\r\ninterrupted him by asking the professor how he accounted for the earth\r\nhaving suffered so little from such a formidable concussion.\r\n\r\n“I account for it in this way,” answered Rosette: “the earth was\r\ntraveling at the rate of 28,000 leagues an hour, and Gallia at the rate\r\nof 57,000 leagues an hour, therefore the result was the same as though\r\na train rushing along at a speed of about 86,000 leagues an hour had\r\nsuddenly encountered some obstacle. The nucleus of the comet, being\r\nexcessively hard, has done exactly what a ball would do fired with that\r\nvelocity close to a pane of glass. It has crossed the earth without\r\ncracking it.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible you may be right,” said Servadac, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Right! of course I am right!” replied the snappish professor. Soon,\r\nhowever, recovering his equanimity, he continued: “It is fortunate\r\nthat the earth was only touched obliquely; if the comet had impinged\r\nperpendicularly, it must have plowed its way deep below the surface, and\r\nthe disasters it might have caused are beyond reckoning. Perhaps,”\r\n he added, with a smile, “even Montmartre might not have survived the\r\ncalamity.”\r\n\r\n“Sir!” shouted Ben Zoof, quite unable to bear the unprovoked attack.\r\n\r\n“Quiet, Ben Zoof!” said Servadac sternly.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the sake of peace, Isaac Hakkabut, who at length was\r\nbeginning to realize something of the true condition of things, came\r\nforward at this moment, and in a voice trembling with eagerness,\r\nimplored the professor to tell him when they would all be back again\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\n“Are you in a great hurry?” asked the professor coolly.\r\n\r\nThe Jew was about to speak again, when Captain Servadac interposed:\r\n“Allow me to say that, in somewhat more scientific terms, I was about to\r\nask you the same question. Did I not understand you to say that, as the\r\nconsequence of the collision, the character of the comet’s orbit has\r\nbeen changed?”\r\n\r\n“You did, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Did you imply that the orbit has ceased to be a parabola?”\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“Is it then an hyperbola? and are we to be carried on far and away into\r\nremote distance, and never, never to return?”\r\n\r\n“I did not say an hyperbola.”\r\n\r\n“And is it not?”\r\n\r\n“It is not.”\r\n\r\n“Then it must be an ellipse?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And does its plane coincide with the plane of the earth?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then it must be a periodic comet?”\r\n\r\n“It is.”\r\n\r\nServadac involuntarily raised a ringing shout of joy that echoed again\r\nalong the gallery.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued the professor, “Gallia is a periodic comet, and\r\nallowing for the perturbations to which it is liable from the attraction\r\nof Mars and Jupiter and Saturn, it will return to the earth again in two\r\nyears precisely.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that in two years after the first shock, Gallia will meet the\r\nearth at the same point as they met before?” said Lieutenant Procope.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid so,” said Rosette.\r\n\r\n“Why afraid?”\r\n\r\n“Because we are doing exceedingly well as we are.” The professor stamped\r\nhis foot upon the ground, by way of emphasis, and added, “If I had my\r\nwill, Gallia should never return to the earth again!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. A REVISED CALENDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAll previous hypotheses, then, were now forgotten in the presence of the\r\none great fact that Gallia was a comet and gravitating through remote\r\nsolar regions. Captain Servadac became aware that the huge disc that\r\nhad been looming through the clouds after the shock was the form of the\r\nretreating earth, to the proximity of which the one high tide they had\r\nexperienced was also to be attributed.\r\n\r\nAs to the fulfillment of the professor’s prediction of an ultimate\r\nreturn to the terrestrial sphere, that was a point on which it must\r\nbe owned that the captain, after the first flush of his excitement was\r\nover, was not without many misgivings.\r\n\r\nThe next day or two were spent in providing for the accommodation of the\r\nnew comer. Fortunately his desires were very moderate; he seemed to live\r\namong the stars, and as long as he was well provided with coffee, he\r\ncared little for luxuries, and paid little or no regard to the ingenuity\r\nwith which all the internal arrangements of Nina’s Hive had been\r\ndevised. Anxious to show all proper respect to his former tutor,\r\nServadac proposed to leave the most comfortable apartment of the place\r\nat his disposal; but the professor resolutely declined to occupy it,\r\nsaying that what he required was a small chamber, no matter how small,\r\nprovided that it was elevated and secluded, which he could use as\r\nan observatory and where he might prosecute his studies without\r\ndisturbance. A general search was instituted, and before long they were\r\nlucky enough to find, about a hundred feet above the central grotto, a\r\nsmall recess or reduct hollowed, as it were, in the mountain side, which\r\nwould exactly answer their purpose. It contained room enough for a bed,\r\na table, an arm-chair, a chest of drawers, and, what was of still more\r\nconsequence, for the indispensable telescope. One small stream of\r\nlava, an off-shoot of the great torrent, sufficed to warm the apartment\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nIn these retired quarters the astronomer took up his abode. It was on\r\nall hands acknowledged to be advisable to let him go on entirely in his\r\nown way. His meals were taken to him at stated intervals; he slept but\r\nlittle; carried on his calculations by day, his observations by night,\r\nand very rarely made his appearance amongst the rest of the little\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe cold now became very intense, the thermometer registering 30 degrees\r\nF. below zero. The mercury, however, never exhibited any of those\r\nfluctuations that are ever and again to be observed in variable\r\nclimates, but continued slowly and steadily to fall, and in all\r\nprobability would continue to do so until it reached the normal\r\ntemperature of the regions of outlying space.\r\n\r\nThis steady sinking of the mercury was accompanied by a complete\r\nstillness of the atmosphere; the very air seemed to be congealed; no\r\nparticle of it stirred; from zenith to horizon there was never a cloud;\r\nneither were there any of the damp mists or dry fogs which so often\r\nextend over the polar regions of the earth; the sky was always clear;\r\nthe sun shone by day and the stars by night without causing any\r\nperceptible difference in the temperature.\r\n\r\nThese peculiar conditions rendered the cold endurable even in the open\r\nair. The cause of so many of the diseases that prove fatal to Arctic\r\nexplorers resides in the cutting winds, unwholesome fogs, or terrible\r\nsnow drifts, which, by drying up, relaxing, or otherwise affecting the\r\nlungs, make them incapable of fulfilling their proper functions. But\r\nduring periods of calm weather, when the air has been absolutely still,\r\nmany polar navigators, well-clothed and properly fed, have been known\r\nto withstand a temperature when the thermometer has fallen to 60 degrees\r\nbelow zero. It was the experience of Parry upon Melville Island, of\r\nKane beyond latitude 81 degrees north, and of Hall and the crew of the\r\n_Polaris_, that, however intense the cold, in the absence of the wind\r\nthey could always brave its rigor.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, then, the extreme lowness of the temperature, the\r\nlittle population found that they were able to move about in the open\r\nair with perfect immunity. The governor general made it his special care\r\nto see that his people were all well fed and warmly clad. Food was\r\nboth wholesome and abundant, and besides the furs brought from the\r\n_Dobryna’s_ stores, fresh skins could very easily be procured and\r\nmade up into wearing apparel. A daily course of out-door exercise was\r\nenforced upon everyone; not even Pablo and Nina were exempted from the\r\ngeneral rule; the two children, muffled up in furs, looking like little\r\nEsquimeaux, skated along together, Pablo ever at his companion’s\r\nside, ready to give her a helping hand whenever she was weary with her\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nAfter his interview with the newly arrived astronomer, Isaac Hakkabut\r\nslunk back again to his tartan. A change had come over his ideas; he\r\ncould no longer resist the conviction that he was indeed millions and\r\nmillions of miles away from the earth, where he had carried on so varied\r\nand remunerative a traffic. It might be imagined that this realization\r\nof his true position would have led him to a better mind, and that,\r\nin some degree at least, he would have been induced to regard the few\r\nfellow-creatures with whom his lot had been so strangely cast, otherwise\r\nthan as mere instruments to be turned to his own personal and pecuniary\r\nadvantage; but no--the desire of gain was too thoroughly ingrained into\r\nhis hard nature ever to be eradicated, and secure in his knowledge that\r\nhe was under the protection of a French officer, who, except under the\r\nmost urgent necessity, would not permit him to be molested in retaining\r\nhis property, he determined to wait for some emergency to arise which\r\nshould enable him to use his present situation for his own profit.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the Jew took it into account that although the chances\r\nof returning to the earth might be remote, yet from what he had heard\r\nfrom the professor he could not believe that they were improbable; on\r\nthe other, he knew that a considerable sum of money, in English and\r\nRussian coinage, was in the possession of various members of the little\r\ncolony, and this, although valueless now, would be worth as much as ever\r\nif the proper condition of things should be restored; accordingly, he\r\nset his heart on getting all the monetary wealth of Gallia into his\r\npossession, and to do this he must sell his goods. But he would not\r\nsell them yet; there might come a time when for many articles the supply\r\nwould not be equal to the demand; that would be the time for him;\r\nby waiting he reckoned he should be able to transact some lucrative\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nSuch in his solitude were old Isaac’s cogitations, whilst the universal\r\npopulation of Nina’s Hive were congratulating themselves upon being rid\r\nof his odious presence.\r\n\r\nAs already stated in the message brought by the carrier pigeon, the\r\ndistance traveled by Gallia in April was 39,000,000 leagues, and at the\r\nend of the month she was 110,000,000 leagues from the sun. A diagram\r\nrepresenting the elliptical orbit of the planet, accompanied by\r\nan ephemeris made out in minute detail, had been drawn out by the\r\nprofessor. The curve was divided into twenty-four sections of unequal\r\nlength, representing respectively the distance described in the\r\ntwenty-four months of the Gallian year, the twelve former divisions,\r\naccording to Kepler’s law, gradually diminishing in length as they\r\napproached the point denoting the aphelion and increasing as they neared\r\nthe perihelion.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 12th of May that Rosette exhibited this result of his\r\nlabors to Servadac, the count, and the lieutenant, who visited his\r\napartment and naturally examined the drawing with the keenest interest.\r\nGallia’s path, extending beyond the orbit of Jupiter, lay clearly\r\ndefined before their eyes, the progress along the orbit and the solar\r\ndistances being inserted for each month separately. Nothing could look\r\nplainer, and if the professor’s calculations were correct (a point upon\r\nwhich they dared not, if they would, express the semblance of a doubt),\r\nGallia would accomplish her revolution in precisely two years, and would\r\nmeet the earth, which would in the same period of time have completed\r\ntwo annual revolutions, in the very same spot as before. What would be\r\nthe consequences of a second collision they scarcely ventured to think.\r\n\r\nWithout lifting his eye from the diagram, which he was still carefully\r\nscrutinizing, Servadac said, “I see that during the month of May, Gallia\r\nwill only travel 30,400,000 leagues, and that this will leave her about\r\n140,000,000 leagues distant from the sun.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” replied the professor.\r\n\r\n“Then we have already passed the zone of the telescopic planets, have we\r\nnot?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n“Can you not use your eyes?” said the professor, testily. “If you will\r\nlook you will see the zone marked clearly enough upon the map.”\r\n\r\nWithout noticing the interruption, Servadac continued his own remarks,\r\n“The comet then, I see, is to reach its aphelion on the 15th of January,\r\nexactly a twelvemonth after passing its perihelion.”\r\n\r\n“A twelvemonth! Not a Gallian twelvemonth?” exclaimed Rosette.\r\n\r\nServadac looked bewildered. Lieutenant Procope could not suppress a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“What are you laughing at?” demanded the professor, turning round upon\r\nhim angrily.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, sir; only it amuses me to see how you want to revise the\r\nterrestrial calendar.”\r\n\r\n“I want to be logical, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“By all manner of means, my dear professor, let us be logical.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, listen to me,” resumed the professor, stiffly. “I presume\r\nyou are taking it for granted that the Gallian year--by which I mean\r\nthe time in which Gallia makes one revolution round the sun--is equal in\r\nlength to two terrestrial years.”\r\n\r\nThey signified their assent.\r\n\r\n“And that year, like every other year, ought to be divided into twelve\r\nmonths.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly, if you wish it,” said the captain, acquiescing.\r\n\r\n“If I wish it!” exclaimed Rosette. “Nothing of the sort! Of course a\r\nyear must have twelve months!”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“And how many days will make a month?” asked the professor.\r\n\r\n“I suppose sixty or sixty-two, as the case may be. The days now are only\r\nhalf as long as they used to be,” answered the captain.\r\n\r\n“Servadac, don’t be thoughtless!” cried Rosette, with all the petulant\r\nimpatience of the old pedagogue. “If the days are only half as long\r\nas they were, sixty of them cannot make up a twelfth part of Gallia’s\r\nyear--cannot be a month.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose not,” replied the confused captain.\r\n\r\n“Do you not see, then,” continued the astronomer, “that if a Gallian\r\nmonth is twice as long as a terrestrial month, and a Gallian day is only\r\nhalf as long as a terrestrial day, there must be a hundred and twenty\r\ndays in every month?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt you are right, professor,” said Count Timascheff; “but do you\r\nnot think that the use of a new calendar such as this would practically\r\nbe very troublesome?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all! not at all! I do not intend to use any other,” was the\r\nprofessor’s bluff reply.\r\n\r\nAfter pondering for a few moments, the captain spoke again. “According,\r\nthen, to this new calendar, it isn’t the middle of May at all; it must\r\nnow be some time in March.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the professor, “to-day is the 26th of March. It is the\r\n266th day of the Gallian year. It corresponds with the 133d day of the\r\nterrestrial year. You are quite correct, it is the 26th of March.”\r\n\r\n“Strange!” muttered Servadac.\r\n\r\n“And a month, a terrestrial month, thirty old days, sixty new days\r\nhence, it will be the 86th of March.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” roared the captain; “this is logic with a vengeance!”\r\n\r\nThe old professor had an undefined consciousness that his former pupil\r\nwas laughing at him; and as it was growing late, he made an excuse\r\nthat he had no more leisure. The visitors accordingly quitted the\r\nobservatory.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that the revised calendar was left to the professor’s\r\nsole use, and the colony was fairly puzzled whenever he referred to such\r\nunheard-of dates as the 47th of April or the 118th of May.\r\n\r\nAccording to the old calendar, June had now arrived; [illustration\r\nomitted] [page intentionally blank] and by the professor’s tables Gallia\r\nduring the month would have advanced 27,500,000 leagues farther along\r\nits orbit, and would have attained a distance of 155,000,000 leagues\r\nfrom the sun. The thermometer continued to fall; the atmosphere remained\r\nclear as heretofore. The population performed their daily avocations\r\nwith systematic routine; and almost the only thing that broke the\r\nmonotony of existence was an occasional visit from the blustering,\r\nnervous, little professor, when some sudden fancy induced him to throw\r\naside his astronomical studies for a time, and pay a visit to the common\r\nhall. His arrival there was generally hailed as the precursor of a\r\nlittle season of excitement. Somehow or other the conversation would\r\neventually work its way round to the topic of a future collision between\r\nthe comet and the earth; and in the same degree as this was a matter\r\nof sanguine anticipation to Captain Servadac and his friends, it was a\r\nmatter of aversion to the astronomical enthusiast, who had no desire to\r\nquit his present quarters in a sphere which, being of his own discovery,\r\nhe could hardly have cared for more if it had been of his own creation.\r\nThe interview would often terminate in a scene of considerable\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of June (old calendar) the professor burst like a\r\ncannon-ball into the central hall, where they were all assembled, and\r\nwithout a word of salutation or of preface, accosted the lieutenant in\r\nthe way in which in earlier days he had been accustomed to speak to an\r\nidle school-boy, “Now, lieutenant! no evasions! no shufflings! Tell me,\r\nhave you or have you not circumnavigated Gallia?”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant drew himself up stiffly. “Evasions! shufflings! I am not\r\naccustomed, sir--” he began in a tone evidencing no little resentment;\r\nbut catching a hint from the count he subdued his voice, and simply\r\nsaid, “We have.”\r\n\r\n“And may I ask,” continued the professor, quite unaware of his previous\r\ndiscourtesy, “whether, when you made your voyage, you took any account\r\nof distances?”\r\n\r\n“As approximately as I could,” replied the lieutenant; “I did what I\r\ncould by log and compass. I was unable to take the altitude of sun or\r\nstar.”\r\n\r\n“At what result did you arrive? What is the measurement of our equator?”\r\n\r\n“I estimate the total circumference of the equator to be about 1,400\r\nmiles.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the professor, more than half speaking to himself, “a\r\ncircumference of 1,400 miles would give a diameter of about 450 miles.\r\nThat would be approximately about one-sixteenth of the diameter of the\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\nRaising his voice, he continued, “Gentlemen, in order to complete my\r\naccount of my comet Gallia, I require to know its area, its mass, its\r\nvolume, its density, its specific gravity.”\r\n\r\n“Since we know the diameter,” remarked the lieutenant, “there can be no\r\ndifficulty in finding its surface and its volume.”\r\n\r\n“And did I say there was any difficulty?” asked the professor, fiercely.\r\n“I have been able to reckon that ever since I was born.”\r\n\r\n“Cock-a-doodle-doo!” cried Ben Zoof, delighted at any opportunity of\r\npaying off his old grudge.\r\n\r\nThe professor looked at him, but did not vouchsafe a word. Addressing\r\nthe captain, he said, “Now, Servadac, take your paper and a pen, and\r\nfind me the surface of Gallia.”\r\n\r\nWith more submission than when he was a school-boy, the captain sat down\r\nand endeavored to recall the proper formula.\r\n\r\n“The surface of a sphere? Multiply circumference by diameter.”\r\n\r\n“Right!” cried Rosette; “but it ought to be done by this time.”\r\n\r\n“Circumference, 1,400; diameter, 450; area of surface, 630,000,” read\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Rosette, “630,000 square miles; just 292 times less than\r\nthat of the earth.”\r\n\r\n“Pretty little comet! nice little comet!” muttered Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer bit his lip, snorted, and cast at him a withering look,\r\nbut did not take any further notice.\r\n\r\n“Now, Captain Servadac,” said the professor, “take your pen again, and\r\nfind me the volume of Gallia.”\r\n\r\nThe captain hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Quick, quick!” cried the professor, impatiently; “surely you have not\r\nforgotten how to find the volume of a sphere!”\r\n\r\n“A moment’s breathing time, please.”\r\n\r\n“Breathing time, indeed! A mathematician should not want breathing\r\ntime! Come, multiply the surface by the third of the radius. Don’t you\r\nrecollect?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac applied himself to his task while the by-standers\r\nwaited, with some difficulty suppressing their inclination to laugh.\r\nThere was a short silence, at the end of which Servadac announced that\r\nthe volume of the comet was 47,880,000 cubic miles.\r\n\r\n“Just about 5,000 times less than the earth,” observed the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“Nice little comet! pretty little comet!” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\nThe professor scowled at him, and was manifestly annoyed at having the\r\ninsignificant dimensions of his comet pointed out in so disparaging\r\na manner. Lieutenant Procope further remarked that from the earth\r\nhe supposed it to be about as conspicuous as a star of the seventh\r\nmagnitude, and would require a good telescope to see it.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the orderly, aloud; “charming little comet! so pretty;\r\nand so modest!”\r\n\r\n“You rascal!” roared the professor, and clenched his hand in passion, as\r\nif about to strike him. Ben Zoof laughed the more, and was on the point\r\nof repeating his satirical comments, when a stern order from the captain\r\nmade him hold his tongue. The truth was that the professor was just as\r\nsensitive about his comet as the orderly was about Montmartre, and if\r\nthe contention between the two had been allowed to go on unchecked, it\r\nis impossible to say what serious quarrel might not have arisen.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Rosette’s equanimity had been restored, he said, “Thus,\r\nthen, gentlemen, the diameter, the surface, the volume of my comet are\r\nsettled; but there is more to be done. I shall not be satisfied until,\r\nby actual measurement, I have determined its mass, its density, and the\r\nforce of gravity at its surface.”\r\n\r\n“A laborious problem,” remarked Count Timascheff.\r\n\r\n“Laborious or not, it has to be accomplished. I am resolved to find out\r\nwhat my comet weighs.”\r\n\r\n“Would it not be of some assistance, if we knew of what substance it is\r\ncomposed?” asked the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“That is of no moment at all,” replied the professor; “the problem is\r\nindependent of it.”\r\n\r\n“Then we await your orders,” was the captain’s reply.\r\n\r\n“You must understand, however,” said Rosette, “that there are various\r\npreliminary calculations to be made; you will have to wait till they are\r\nfinished.”\r\n\r\n“As long as you please,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“No hurry at all,” observed the captain, who was not in the least\r\nimpatient to continue his mathematical exercises.\r\n\r\n“Then, gentlemen,” said the astronomer, “with your leave we will for\r\nthis purpose make an appointment a few weeks hence. What do you say to\r\nthe 62d of April?”\r\n\r\nWithout noticing the general smile which the novel date provoked, the\r\nastronomer left the hall, and retired to his observatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. WANTED: A STEELYARD\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the still diminishing influence of the sun’s attraction, but\r\nwithout let or hindrance, Gallia continued its interplanetary course,\r\naccompanied by Nerina, its captured satellite, which performed its\r\nfortnightly revolutions with unvarying regularity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the question beyond all others important was ever recurring\r\nto the minds of Servadac and his two companions: were the astronomer’s\r\ncalculations correct, and was there a sound foundation for his\r\nprediction that the comet would again touch the earth? But whatever\r\nmight be their doubts or anxieties, they were fain to keep all their\r\nmisgivings to themselves; the professor was of a temper far too\r\ncross-grained for them to venture to ask him to revise or re-examine the\r\nresults of his observations.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the community by no means shared in their uneasiness.\r\nNegrete and his fellow-countrymen yielded to their destiny with\r\nphilosophical indifference. Happier and better provided for than they\r\nhad ever been in their lives, it did not give them a passing thought,\r\nfar less cause any serious concern, whether they were still circling\r\nround the sun, or whether they were being carried right away within the\r\nlimits of another system. Utterly careless of the future, the majos,\r\nlight-hearted as ever, carolled out their favorite songs, just as if\r\nthey had never quitted the shores of their native land.\r\n\r\nHappiest of all were Pablo and Nina. Racing through the galleries of the\r\nHive, clambering over the rocks upon the shore, one day skating far\r\naway across the frozen ocean, the next fishing in the lake that was kept\r\nliquid by the heat of the lava-torrent, the two children led a life of\r\nperpetual enjoyment. Nor was their recreation allowed to interfere with\r\ntheir studies. Captain Servadac, who in common with the count really\r\nliked them both, conceived that the responsibilities of a parent in\r\nsome degree had devolved upon him, and took great care in superintending\r\ntheir daily lessons, which he succeeded in making hardly less pleasant\r\nthan their sports.\r\n\r\nIndulged and loved by all, it was little wonder that young Pablo had no\r\nlonging for the scorching plains of Andalusia, or that little Nina\r\nhad lost all wish to return with her pet goat to the barren rocks of\r\nSardinia. They had now a home in which they had nothing to desire.\r\n\r\n“Have you no father nor mother?” asked Pablo, one day.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“No more have I,” said the boy, “I used to run along by the side of the\r\ndiligences when I was in Spain.”\r\n\r\n“I used to look after goats at Madalena,” said Nina; “but it is much\r\nnicer here--I am so happy here. I have you for a brother, and everybody\r\nis so kind. I am afraid they will spoil us, Pablo,” she added, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, Nina; you are too good to be spoiled, and when I am with you,\r\nyou make me good too,” said Pablo, gravely.\r\n\r\nJuly had now arrived. During the month Gallia’s advance along its orbit\r\nwould be reduced to 22,000,000 leagues, the distance from the sun at the\r\nend being 172,000,000 leagues, about four and a half times as great as\r\nthe average distance of the earth from the sun. It was traveling now\r\nat about the same speed as the earth, which traverses the ecliptic at a\r\nrate of 21,000,000 leagues a month, or 28,800 leagues an hour.\r\n\r\nIn due time the 62d April, according to the revised Gallian calendar,\r\ndawned; and in punctual fulfillment of the professor’s appointment, a\r\nnote was delivered to Servadac to say that he was ready, and hoped that\r\nday to commence operations for calculating the mass and density of his\r\ncomet, as well as the force of gravity at its surface.\r\n\r\nA point of far greater interest to Captain Servadac and his friends\r\nwould have been to ascertain the nature of the substance of which the\r\ncomet was composed, but they felt pledged to render the professor\r\nany aid they could in the researches upon which he had set his heart.\r\nWithout delay, therefore, they assembled in the central hall, where they\r\nwere soon joined by Rosette, who seemed to be in fairly good temper.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he began, “I propose to-day to endeavor to complete our\r\nobservations of the elements of my comet. Three matters of investigation\r\nare before us. First, the measure of gravity at its surface; this\r\nattractive force we know, by the increase of our own muscular force,\r\nmust of course be considerably less than that at the surface of the\r\nearth. Secondly, its mass, that is, the quality of its matter. And\r\nthirdly, its density or quantity of matter in a unit of its volume. We\r\nwill proceed, gentlemen, if you please, to weigh Gallia.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof, who had just entered the hall, caught the professor’s last\r\nsentence, and without saying a word, went out again and was absent for\r\nsome minutes. When he returned, he said, “If you want to weigh this\r\ncomet of yours, I suppose you want a pair of scales; but I have been\r\nto look, and I cannot find a pair anywhere. And what’s more,” he added\r\nmischievously, “you won’t get them anywhere.”\r\n\r\nA frown came over the professor’s countenance. Servadac saw it, and gave\r\nhis orderly a sign that he should desist entirely from his bantering.\r\n\r\n“I require, gentlemen,” resumed Rosette, “first of all to know by how\r\nmuch the weight of a kilogramme here differs from its weight upon the\r\nearth; the attraction, as we have said, being less, the weight will\r\nproportionately be less also.”\r\n\r\n“Then an ordinary pair of scales, being under the influence of\r\nattraction, I suppose, would not answer your purpose,” submitted the\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\n“And the very kilogramme weight you used would have become lighter,” put\r\nin the count, deferentially.\r\n\r\n“Pray, gentlemen, do not interrupt me,” said the professor,\r\nauthoritatively, as if _ex cathedra_. “I need no instruction on these\r\npoints.”\r\n\r\nProcope and Timascheff demurely bowed their heads.\r\n\r\nThe professor resumed. “Upon a steelyard, or spring-balance, dependent\r\nupon mere tension or flexibility, the attraction will have no influence.\r\nIf I suspend a weight equivalent to the weight of a kilogramme, the\r\nindex will register the proper weight on the surface of Gallia. Thus\r\nI shall arrive at the difference I want: the difference between the\r\nearth’s attraction and the comet’s. Will you, therefore, have\r\nthe goodness to provide me at once with a steelyard and a tested\r\nkilogramme?”\r\n\r\nThe audience looked at one another, and then at Ben Zoof, who was\r\nthoroughly acquainted with all their resources. “We have neither one nor\r\nthe other,” said the orderly.\r\n\r\nThe professor stamped with vexation.\r\n\r\n“I believe old Hakkabut has a steelyard on board his tartan,” said Ben\r\nZoof, presently.\r\n\r\n“Then why didn’t you say so before, you idiot?” roared the excitable\r\nlittle man.\r\n\r\nAnxious to pacify him, Servadac assured him that every exertion should\r\nbe made to procure the instrument, and directed Ben Zoof to go to the\r\nJew and borrow it.\r\n\r\n“No, stop a moment,” he said, as Ben Zoof was moving away on his,\r\nerrand; “perhaps I had better go with you myself; the old Jew may make a\r\ndifficulty about lending us any of his property.”\r\n\r\n“Why should we not all go?” asked the count; “we should see what kind of\r\na life the misanthrope leads on board the _Hansa_.”\r\n\r\nThe proposal met with general approbation. Before they started,\r\nProfessor Rosette requested that one of the men might be ordered to cut\r\nhim a cubic decimeter out of the solid substance of Gallia. “My engineer\r\nis the man for that,” said the count; “he will do it well for you if you\r\nwill give him the precise measurement.”\r\n\r\n“What! you don’t mean,” exclaimed the professor, again going off into a\r\npassion, “that you haven’t a proper measure of length?”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof was sent off to ransack the stores for the article in question,\r\nbut no measure was forthcoming. “Most likely we shall find one on the\r\ntartan,” said the orderly.\r\n\r\n“Then let us lose no time in trying,” answered the professor, as he\r\nhustled with hasty strides into the gallery.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party followed, and were soon in the open air upon the\r\nrocks that overhung the shore. They descended to the level of the frozen\r\nwater and made their way towards the little creek where the _Dobryna_\r\nand the _Hansa_ lay firmly imprisoned in their icy bonds.\r\n\r\nThe temperature was low beyond previous experience; but well muffled up\r\nin fur, they all endured it without much actual suffering. Their breath\r\nissued in vapor, which was at once congealed into little crystals upon\r\ntheir whiskers, beards, eyebrows, and eyelashes, until their faces,\r\ncovered with countless snow-white prickles, were truly ludicrous. The\r\nlittle professor, most comical of all, resembled nothing so much as the\r\ncub of an Arctic bear.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o’clock in the morning. The sun was rapidly approaching the\r\nzenith; but its disc, from the extreme remoteness, was proportionately\r\ndwarfed; its beams being all but destitute of their proper warmth and\r\nradiance. The volcano to its very summit and the surrounding rocks were\r\nstill covered with the unsullied mantle of snow that had fallen while\r\nthe atmosphere was still to some extent charged with vapor; but on the\r\nnorth side the snow had given place to the cascade of fiery lava, which,\r\nmaking its way down the sloping rocks as far as the vaulted opening of\r\nthe central cavern, fell thence perpendicularly into the sea. Above\r\nthe cavern, 130 feet up the mountain, was a dark hole, above which\r\nthe stream of lava made a bifurcation in its course. From this hole\r\nprojected the case of an astronomer’s telescope; it was the opening of\r\nPalmyrin Rosette’s observatory.\r\n\r\nSea and land seemed blended into one dreary whiteness, to which the pale\r\nblue sky offered scarcely any contrast. The shore was indented with the\r\nmarks of many footsteps left by the colonists either on their way to\r\ncollect ice for drinking purposes, or as the result of their skating\r\nexpeditions; the edges of the skates had cut out a labyrinth of curves\r\ncomplicated as the figures traced by aquatic insects upon the surface of\r\na pool.\r\n\r\nAcross the quarter of a mile of level ground that lay between the\r\nmountain and the creek, a series of footprints, frozen hard into the\r\nsnow, marked the course taken by Isaac Hakkabut on his last return from\r\nNina’s Hive.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the creek, Lieutenant Procope drew his companions’\r\nattention to the elevation of the _Dobryna’s_ and _Hansa’s_ waterline,\r\nboth vessels being now some fifteen feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n“What a strange phenomenon!” exclaimed the captain.\r\n\r\n“It makes me very uneasy,” rejoined the lieutenant; “in shallow places\r\nlike this, as the crust of ice thickens, it forces everything upwards\r\nwith irresistible force.”\r\n\r\n“But surely this process of congelation must have a limit!” said the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“But who can say what that limit will be? Remember that we have not yet\r\nreached our maximum of cold,” replied Procope.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I hope not!” exclaimed the professor; “where would be the use\r\nof our traveling 200,000,000 leagues from the sun, if we are only to\r\nexperience the same temperature as we should find at the poles of the\r\nearth?”\r\n\r\n“Fortunately for us, however, professor,” said the lieutenant, with a\r\nsmile, “the temperature of the remotest space never descends beyond 70\r\ndegrees below zero.”\r\n\r\n“And as long as there is no wind,” added Servadac, “we may pass\r\ncomfortably through the winter, without a single attack of catarrh.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope proceeded to impart to the count his anxiety\r\nabout the situation of his yacht. He pointed out that by the constant\r\nsuperposition of new deposits of ice, the vessel would be elevated to\r\na great height, and consequently in the event of a thaw, it must\r\nbe exposed to a calamity similar to those which in polar seas cause\r\ndestruction to so many whalers.\r\n\r\nThere was no time now for concerting measures offhand to prevent the\r\ndisaster, for the other members of the party had already reached the\r\nspot where the _Hansa_ lay bound in her icy trammels. A flight of steps,\r\nrecently hewn by Hakkabut himself, gave access for the present to the\r\ngangway, but it was evident that some different contrivance would\r\nhave to be resorted to when the tartan should be elevated perhaps to a\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nA thin curl of blue smoke issued from the copper funnel that projected\r\nabove the mass of snow which had accumulated upon the deck of the\r\n_Hansa_. The owner was sparing of his fuel, and it was only the\r\nnon-conducting layer of ice enveloping the tartan that rendered the\r\ninternal temperature endurable.\r\n\r\n“Hi! old Nebuchadnezzar, where are you?” shouted Ben Zoof, at the full\r\nstrength of his lungs.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice, the cabin door opened, and the Jew’s head and\r\nshoulders protruded onto the deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. MONEY AT A PREMIUM\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who’s there? I have nothing here for anyone. Go away!” Such was the\r\ninhospitable greeting with which Isaac Hakkabut received his visitors.\r\n\r\n“Hakkabut! do you take us for thieves?” asked Servadac, in tones of\r\nstern displeasure.\r\n\r\n“Oh, your Excellency, my lord, I did not know that it was you,” whined\r\nthe Jew, but without emerging any farther from his cabin.\r\n\r\n“Now, old Hakkabut, come out of your shell! Come and show the governor\r\nproper respect, when he gives you the honor of his company,” cried Ben\r\nZoof, who by this time had clambered onto the deck.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable hesitation, but still keeping his hold upon the\r\ncabin-door, the Jew made up his mind to step outside. “What do you\r\nwant?” he inquired, timorously.\r\n\r\n“I want a word with you,” said Servadac, “but I do not want to stand\r\ntalking out here in the cold.”\r\n\r\nFollowed by the rest of the party, he proceeded to mount the steps. The\r\nJew trembled from head to foot. “But I cannot let you into my cabin. I\r\nam a poor man; I have nothing to give you,” he moaned piteously.\r\n\r\n“Here he is!” laughed Ben Zoof, contemptuously; “he is beginning his\r\nchapter of lamentations over again. But standing out here will never do.\r\nOut of the way, old Hakkabut, I say! out of the way!” and, without more\r\nado, he thrust the astonished Jew on one side and opened the door of the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nServadac, however, declined to enter until he had taken the pains to\r\nexplain to the owner of the tartan that he had no intention of laying\r\nviolent hands upon his property, and that if the time should ever come\r\nthat his cargo was in requisition for the common use, he should receive\r\na proper price for his goods, the same as he would in Europe.\r\n\r\n“Europe, indeed!” muttered the Jew maliciously between his teeth.\r\n“European prices will not do for me. I must have Gallian prices--and of\r\nmy own fixing, too!”\r\n\r\nSo large a portion of the vessel had been appropriated to the cargo that\r\nthe space reserved for the cabin was of most meager dimensions. In one\r\ncorner of the compartment stood a small iron stove, in which smoldered a\r\nbare handful of coals; in another was a trestle-board which served as a\r\nbed; two or three stools and a rickety deal table, together with a few\r\ncooking utensils, completed a stock of furniture which was worthy of its\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nOn entering the cabin, Ben Zoof’s first proceeding was to throw on the\r\nfire a liberal supply of coals, utterly regardless of the groans of poor\r\nIsaac, who would almost as soon have parted with his own bones as submit\r\nto such reckless expenditure of his fuel. The perishing temperature\r\nof the cabin, however, was sufficient justification for the orderly’s\r\nconduct, and by a little skillful manipulation he soon succeeded in\r\ngetting up a tolerable fire.\r\n\r\nThe visitors having taken what seats they could, Hakkabut closed the\r\ndoor, and, like a prisoner awaiting his sentence, stood with folded\r\nhands, expecting the captain to speak.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Servadac; “we have come to ask a favor.”\r\n\r\nImagining that at least half his property was to be confiscated, the\r\nJew began to break out into his usual formula about being a poor man and\r\nhaving nothing to spare; but Servadac, without heeding his complainings,\r\nwent on: “We are not going to ruin you, you know.”\r\n\r\nHakkabut looked keenly into the captain’s face.\r\n\r\n“We have only come to know whether you can lend us a steelyard.”\r\n\r\nSo far from showing any symptom of relief, the old miser exclaimed,\r\nwith a stare of astonishment, as if he had been asked for some thousand\r\nfrancs: “A steelyard?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” echoed the professor, impatiently; “a steelyard.”\r\n\r\n“Have you not one?” asked Servadac.\r\n\r\n“To be sure he has!” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\nOld Isaac stammered and stuttered, but at last confessed that perhaps\r\nthere might be one amongst the stores.\r\n\r\n“Then, surely, you will not object to lend it to us?” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“Only for one day,” added the professor.\r\n\r\nThe Jew stammered again, and began to object. “It is a very delicate\r\ninstrument, your Excellency. The cold, you know, the cold may do injury\r\nto the spring; and perhaps you are going to use it to weigh something\r\nvery heavy.”\r\n\r\n“Why, old Ephraim, do you suppose we are going to weigh a mountain with\r\nit?” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“Better than that!” cried out the professor, triumphantly; “we are going\r\nto weigh Gallia with it; my comet.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful Heaven!” shrieked Isaac, feigning consternation at the bare\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nServadac knew well enough that the Jew was holding out only for a good\r\nbargain, and assured him that the steelyard was required for no other\r\npurpose than to weigh a kilogramme, which (considering how much lighter\r\neverything had become) could not possibly put the slightest strain upon\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nThe Jew still spluttered, and moaned, and hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Servadac, “if you do not like to lend us your\r\nsteelyard, do you object to sell it to us?”\r\n\r\nIsaac fairly shrieked aloud. “God of Israel!” he ejaculated, “sell my\r\nsteelyard? Would you deprive me of one of the most indispensable of\r\nmy means of livelihood? How should I weigh my merchandise without my\r\nsteelyard--my solitary steelyard, so delicate and so correct?”\r\n\r\nThe orderly wondered how his master could refrain from strangling the\r\nold miser upon the spot; but Servadac, rather amused than otherwise,\r\ndetermined to try another form of persuasion. “Come, Hakkabut, I see\r\nthat you are not disposed either to lend or to sell your steelyard. What\r\ndo you say to letting us hire it?”\r\n\r\nThe Jew’s eyes twinkled with a satisfaction that he was unable to\r\nconceal. “But what security would you give? The instrument is very\r\nvaluable;” and he looked more cunning than ever.\r\n\r\n“What is it worth? If it is worth twenty francs, I will leave a deposit\r\nof a hundred. Will that satisfy you?”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head doubtfully. “It is very little; indeed, it is too\r\nlittle, your Excellency. Consider, it is the only steelyard in all this\r\nnew world of ours; it is worth more, much more. If I take your deposit\r\nit must be in gold--all gold. But how much do you agree to give me for\r\nthe hire--the hire, one day?”\r\n\r\n“You shall have twenty francs,” said Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is dirt cheap; but never mind, for one day, you shall have it.\r\nDeposit in gold money a hundred francs, and twenty francs for the hire.”\r\n The old man folded his hands in meek resignation.\r\n\r\n“The fellow knows how to make a good bargain,” said Servadac, as Isaac,\r\nafter casting a distrustful look around, went out of the cabin.\r\n\r\n“Detestable old wretch!” replied the count, full of disgust.\r\n\r\nHardly a minute elapsed before the Jew was back again, carrying his\r\nprecious steelyard with ostentatious care. It was of an ordinary kind.\r\nA spring balance, fitted with a hook, held the article to be weighed;\r\na pointer, revolving on a disc, indicated the weight of the article.\r\nProfessor Rosette was manifestly right in asserting that such a machine\r\nwould register results quite independently of any change in the force\r\nof attraction. On the earth it would have registered a kilogramme as a\r\nkilogramme; here it recorded a different value altogether, as the result\r\nof the altered force of gravity.\r\n\r\nGold coinage to the worth of one hundred and twenty francs was handed\r\nover to the Jew, who clutched at the money with unmistakable eagerness.\r\nThe steelyard was committed to the keeping of Ben Zoof, and the visitors\r\nprepared to quit the _Hansa_.\r\n\r\nAll at once it occurred to the professor that the steelyard would be\r\nabsolutely useless to him, unless he had the means for ascertaining the\r\nprecise measurement of the unit of the soil of Gallia which he proposed\r\nto weigh. “Something more you must lend me,” he said, addressing the\r\nJew. “I must have a measure, and I must have a kilogramme.”\r\n\r\n“I have neither of them,” answered Isaac. “I have neither. I am sorry; I\r\nam very sorry.” And this time the old Jew spoke the truth. He would have\r\nbeen really glad to do another stroke or two of business upon terms as\r\nadvantageous as the transaction he had just concluded.\r\n\r\nPalmyrin Rosette scratched his head in perplexity, glaring round upon\r\nhis companions as if they were personally responsible for his annoyance.\r\nHe muttered something about finding a way out of his difficulty, and\r\nhastily mounted the cabin-ladder. The rest followed, but they had hardly\r\nreached the deck when the chink of money was heard in the room below.\r\nHakkabut was locking away the gold in one of the drawers.\r\n\r\nBack again, down the ladder, scrambled the little professor, and before\r\nthe Jew was aware of his presence he had seized him by the tail of his\r\nslouchy overcoat. “Some of your money! I must have money!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Money!” gasped Hakkabut; “I have no money.” He was pale with fright,\r\nand hardly knew what he was saying.\r\n\r\n“Falsehood!” roared Rosette. “Do you think I cannot see?” And peering\r\ndown into the drawer which the Jew was vainly trying to close, he cried,\r\n“Heaps of money! French money! Five-franc pieces! the very thing I want!\r\nI must have them!”\r\n\r\nThe captain and his friends, who had returned to the cabin looked on\r\nwith mingled amusement and bewilderment.\r\n\r\n“They are mine!” shrieked Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“I will have them!” shouted the professor.\r\n\r\n“You shall kill me first!” bellowed the Jew.\r\n\r\n“No, but I must!” persisted the professor again.\r\n\r\nIt was manifestly time for Servadac to interfere. “My dear professor,”\r\n he said, smiling, “allow me to settle this little matter for you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! your Excellency,” moaned the agitated Jew, “protect me! I am but a\r\npoor man--”\r\n\r\n“None of that, Hakkabut. Hold your tongue.” And, turning to Rosette,\r\nthe captain said, “If, sir, I understand right, you require some silver\r\nfive-franc pieces for your operation?”\r\n\r\n“Forty,” said Rosette, surlily.\r\n\r\n“Two hundred francs!” whined Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“Silence!” cried the captain.\r\n\r\n“I must have more than that,” the professor continued. “I want ten\r\ntwo-franc pieces, and twenty half-francs.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see,” said Servadac, “how much is that in all? Two hundred and\r\nthirty francs, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“I dare say it is,” answered the professor.\r\n\r\n“Count, may I ask you,” continued Servadac, “to be security to the Jew\r\nfor this loan to the professor?”\r\n\r\n“Loan!” cried the Jew, “do you mean only a loan?”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” again shouted the captain.\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff, expressing his regret that his purse contained only\r\npaper money, begged to place it at Captain Servadac’s disposal.\r\n\r\n“No paper, no paper!” exclaimed Isaac. “Paper has no currency in\r\nGallia.”\r\n\r\n“About as much as silver,” coolly retorted the count.\r\n\r\n“I am a poor man,” began the Jew.\r\n\r\n“Now, Hakkabut, stop these miserable lamentations of yours, once for\r\nall. Hand us over two hundred and thirty francs in silver money, or we\r\nwill proceed to help ourselves.”\r\n\r\nIsaac began to yell with all his might: “Thieves! thieves!”\r\n\r\nIn a moment Ben Zoof’s hand was clasped tightly over his mouth. “Stop\r\nthat howling, Belshazzar!”\r\n\r\n“Let him alone, Ben Zoof. He will soon come to his senses,” said\r\nServadac, quietly.\r\n\r\nWhen the old Jew had again recovered himself, the captain addressed him.\r\n“Now, tell us, what interest do you expect?”\r\n\r\nNothing could overcome the Jew’s anxiety to make another good bargain.\r\nHe began: “Money is scarce, very scarce, you know--”\r\n\r\n“No more of this!” shouted Servadac. “What interest, I say, what\r\ninterest do you ask?”\r\n\r\nFaltering and undecided still, the Jew went on. “Very scarce, you know.\r\nTen francs a day, I think, would not be unreasonable, considering--”\r\n\r\nThe count had no patience to allow him to finish what he was about\r\nto say. He flung down notes to the value of several rubles. With a\r\ngreediness that could not be concealed, Hakkabut grasped them all.\r\nPaper, indeed, they were; but the cunning Israelite knew that they would\r\nin any case be security far beyond the value of his cash. He was making\r\nsome eighteen hundred per cent. interest, and accordingly chuckled\r\nwithin himself at his unexpected stroke of business.\r\n\r\nThe professor pocketed his French coins with a satisfaction far more\r\ndemonstrative. “Gentlemen,” he said, “with these franc pieces I obtain\r\nthe means of determining accurately both a meter and a kilogramme.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. GALLIA WEIGHED\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, the visitors to the _Hansa_ had reassembled\r\nin the common hall of Nina’s Hive.\r\n\r\n“Now, gentlemen, we can proceed,” said the professor. “May I request\r\nthat this table may be cleared?”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof removed the various articles that were lying on the table, and\r\nthe coins which had just been borrowed from the Jew were placed upon it\r\nin three piles, according to their value.\r\n\r\nThe professor commenced. “Since none of you gentlemen, at the time\r\nof the shock, took the precaution to save either a meter measure or\r\na kilogramme weight from the earth, and since both these articles are\r\nnecessary for the calculation on which we are engaged, I have been\r\nobliged to devise means of my own to replace them.”\r\n\r\nThis exordium delivered, he paused and seemed to watch its effect\r\nupon his audience, who, however, were too well acquainted with the\r\nprofessor’s temper to make any attempt to exonerate themselves from the\r\nrebuke of carelessness, and submitted silently to the implied reproach.\r\n\r\n“I have taken pains,” he continued, “to satisfy myself that these\r\ncoins are in proper condition for my purpose. I find them unworn and\r\nunchipped; indeed, they are almost new. They have been hoarded instead\r\nof circulated; accordingly, they are fit to be utilized for my purpose\r\nof obtaining the precise length of a terrestrial meter.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof looked on in perplexity, regarding the lecturer with much the\r\nsame curiosity as he would have watched the performances of a traveling\r\nmountebank at a fair in Montmartre; but Servadac and his two friends had\r\nalready divined the professor’s meaning. They knew that French coinage\r\nis all decimal, the franc being the standard of which the other coins,\r\nwhether gold, silver, or copper, are multiples or measures; they knew,\r\ntoo, that the caliber or diameter of each piece of money is rigorously\r\ndetermined by law, and that the diameters of the silver coins\r\nrepresenting five francs, two francs, and fifty centimes measure\r\nthirty-seven, twenty-seven, and eighteen millimeters respectively; and\r\nthey accordingly guessed that Professor Rosette had conceived the plan\r\nof placing such a number of these coins in juxtaposition that the\r\nlength of their united diameters should measure exactly the thousand\r\nmillimeters that make up the terrestrial meter.\r\n\r\nThe measurement thus obtained was by means of a pair of compasses\r\ndivided accurately into ten equal portions, or decimeters, each of\r\ncourse 3.93 inches long. A lath was then cut of this exact length and\r\ngiven to the engineer of the _Dobryna_, who was directed to cut out of\r\nthe solid rock the cubic decimeter required by the professor.\r\n\r\nThe next business was to obtain the precise weight of a kilogramme. This\r\nwas by no means a difficult matter. Not only the diameters, but also the\r\nweights, of the French coins are rigidly determined by law, and as the\r\nsilver five-franc pieces always weigh exactly twenty-five grammes,\r\nthe united weight of forty of these coins is known to amount to one\r\nkilogramme.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Ben Zoof; “to be able to do all this I see you must be rich\r\nas well as learned.”\r\n\r\nWith a good-natured laugh at the orderly’s remark, the meeting adjourned\r\nfor a few hours. By the appointed time the engineer had finished his\r\ntask, and with all due care had prepared a cubic decimeter of the\r\nmaterial of the comet.\r\n\r\n“Now, gentlemen,” said Professor Rosette, “we are in a position to\r\ncomplete our calculation; we can now arrive at Gallia’s attraction,\r\ndensity, and mass.”\r\n\r\nEveryone gave him his complete attention.\r\n\r\n“Before I proceed,” he resumed, “I must recall to your minds Newton’s\r\ngeneral law, ‘that the attraction of two bodies is directly proportional\r\nto the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square\r\nof their distances.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Servadac; “we remember that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” continued the professor, “keep it in mind for a\r\nfew minutes now. Look here! In this bag are forty five-franc\r\npieces--altogether they weigh exactly a kilogramme; by which I mean that\r\nif we were on the earth, and I were to hang the bag on the hook of the\r\nsteelyard, the indicator on the dial would register one kilogramme. This\r\nis clear enough, I suppose?”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the professor designedly kept his eyes fixed upon Ben Zoof.\r\nHe was avowedly following the example of Arago, who was accustomed\r\nalways in lecturing to watch the countenance of the least intelligent\r\nof his audience, and when he felt that he had made his meaning clear to\r\nhim, he concluded that he must have succeeded with all the rest. In\r\nthis case, however, it was technical ignorance, rather than any lack\r\nof intelligence, that justified the selection of the orderly for this\r\nspecial attention.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with his scrutiny of Ben Zoof’s face, the professor went on.\r\n“And now, gentlemen, we have to see what these coins weigh here upon\r\nGallia.”\r\n\r\nHe suspended the money bag to the hook; the needle oscillated, and\r\nstopped. “Read it off!” he said.\r\n\r\nThe weight registered was one hundred and thirty-three grammes.\r\n\r\n“There, gentlemen, one hundred and thirty-three grammes! Less than\r\none-seventh of a kilogramme! You see, consequently, that the force of\r\ngravity here on Gallia is not one-seventh of what it is upon the earth!”\r\n\r\n“Interesting!” cried Servadac, “most interesting! But let us go on and\r\ncompute the mass.”\r\n\r\n“No, captain, the density first,” said Rosette.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said the lieutenant; “for, as we already know the volume,\r\nwe can determine the mass as soon as we have ascertained the density.”\r\n\r\nThe professor took up the cube of rock. “You know what this is,” he went\r\non to say. “You know, gentlemen, that this block is a cube hewn from\r\nthe substance of which everywhere, all throughout your voyage of\r\ncircumnavigation, you found Gallia to be composed--a substance to which\r\nyour geological attainments did not suffice to assign a name.”\r\n\r\n“Our curiosity will be gratified,” said Servadac, “if you will enlighten\r\nour ignorance.”\r\n\r\nBut Rosette did not take the slightest notice of the interruption.\r\n\r\n“A substance it is which no doubt constitutes the sole material of\r\nthe comet, extending from its surface to its innermost depths. The\r\nprobability is that it would be so; your experience confirms that\r\nprobability: you have found no trace of any other substance. Of this\r\nrock here is a solid decimeter; let us get at its weight, and we shall\r\nhave the key which will unlock the problem of the whole weight of\r\nGallia. We have demonstrated that the force of attraction here is only\r\none-seventh of what it is upon the earth, and shall consequently have to\r\nmultiply the apparent weight of our cube by seven, in order to ascertain\r\nits proper weight. Do you understand me, goggle-eyes?”\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to Ben Zoof, who was staring hard at him. “No!” said\r\nBen Zoof.\r\n\r\n“I thought not; it is of no use waiting for your puzzle-brains to make\r\nit out. I must talk to those who can understand.”\r\n\r\nThe professor took the cube, and, on attaching it to the hook of the\r\nsteelyard, found that its apparent weight was one kilogramme and four\r\nhundred and thirty grammes.\r\n\r\n“Here it is, gentlemen; one kilogramme, four hundred and thirty grammes.\r\nMultiply that by seven; the product is, as nearly as possible, ten\r\nkilogrammes. What, therefore, is our conclusion? Why, that the density\r\nof Gallia is just about double the density of the earth, which we know\r\nis only five kilogrammes to a cubic decimeter. Had it not been for\r\nthis greater density, the attraction of Gallia would only have been\r\none-fifteenth instead of one-seventh of the terrestrial attraction.”\r\n\r\nThe professor could not refrain from exhibiting his gratification that,\r\nhowever inferior in volume, in density, at least, his comet had the\r\nadvantage over the earth.\r\n\r\nNothing further now remained than to apply the investigations thus\r\nfinished to the determining of the mass or weight. This was a matter of\r\nlittle labor.\r\n\r\n“Let me see,” said the captain; “what is the force of gravity upon the\r\nvarious planets?”\r\n\r\n“You can’t mean, Servadac, that you have forgotten that? But you always\r\nwere a disappointing pupil.”\r\n\r\nThe captain could not help himself: he was forced to confess that his\r\nmemory had failed him.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said the professor, “I must remind you. Taking the\r\nattraction on the earth as 1, that on Mercury is 1.15, on Venus it\r\nis 0.92, on Mars 0.5, and on Jupiter 2.45; on the moon the attraction is 0.16,\r\nwhilst on the surface of the sun a terrestrial kilogramme would weigh 28\r\nkilogrammes.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore, if a man upon the surface of the sun were to fall down, he\r\nwould have considerable difficulty in getting up again. A cannon ball,\r\ntoo, would only fly a few yards,” said Lieutenant Procope.\r\n\r\n“A jolly battle-field for cowards!” exclaimed Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“Not so jolly, Ben Zoof, as you fancy,” said his master; “the cowards\r\nwould be too heavy to run away.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof ventured the remark that, as the smallness of Gallia secured to\r\nits inhabitants such an increase of strength and agility, he was almost\r\nsorry that it had not been a little smaller still.\r\n\r\n“Though it could not anyhow have been very much smaller,” he added,\r\nlooking slyly at the professor.\r\n\r\n“Idiot!” exclaimed Rosette. “Your head is too light already; a puff of\r\nwind would blow it away.”\r\n\r\n“I must take care of my head, then, and hold it on,” replied the\r\nirrepressible orderly.\r\n\r\nUnable to get the last word, the professor was about to retire, when\r\nServadac detained him.\r\n\r\n“Permit me to ask you one more question,” he said. “Can you tell me what\r\nis the nature of the soil of Gallia?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can answer that. And in this matter I do not think your\r\nimpertinent orderly will venture to put Montmartre into the comparison.\r\nThis soil is of a substance not unknown upon the earth.” And speaking\r\nvery slowly, the professor said: “It contains 70 per cent. of tellurium,\r\nand 30 per cent. of gold.”\r\n\r\nServadac uttered an exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n“And the sum of the specific gravities of these two substances is 10,\r\nprecisely the number that represents Gallia’s density.”\r\n\r\n“A comet of gold!” ejaculated the captain.\r\n\r\n“Yes; a realization of what the illustrious Maupertuis has already\r\ndeemed probable,” replied the astronomer.\r\n\r\n“If Gallia, then, should ever become attached to the earth, might it not\r\nbring about an important revolution in all monetary affairs?” inquired\r\nthe count.\r\n\r\n“No doubt about it!” said Rosette, with manifest satisfaction. “It would\r\nsupply the world with about 246,000 trillions of francs.”\r\n\r\n“It would make gold about as cheap as dirt, I suppose,” said Servadac.\r\n\r\nThe last observation, however, was entirely lost upon the professor, who\r\nhad left the hall with an air almost majestic, and was already on his\r\nway to the observatory.\r\n\r\n“And what, I wonder, is the use of all these big figures?” said Ben Zoof\r\nto his master, when next day they were alone together.\r\n\r\n“That’s just the charm of them, my good fellow,” was the captain’s cool\r\nreply, “that they are of no use whatever.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. JUPITER SOMEWHAT CLOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept as to the time the comet would take to revolve round the sun,\r\nit must be confessed that all the professor’s calculations had\r\ncomparatively little interest for anyone but himself, and he was\r\nconsequently left very much to pursue his studies in solitude.\r\n\r\nThe following day was the 1st of August, or, according to Rosette,\r\nthe 63rd of April. In the course of this month Gallia would travel\r\n16,500,000 leagues, attaining at the end a distance of 197,000,000\r\nleagues from the sun. This would leave 81,000,000 leagues more to be\r\ntraversed before reaching the aphelion of the 15th of January, after\r\nwhich it would begin once more to approach the sun.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile, a marvelous world, never before so close within the range\r\nof human vision, was revealing itself. No wonder that Palmyrin Rosette\r\ncared so little to quit his observatory; for throughout those calm,\r\nclear Gallian nights, when the book of the firmament lay open before\r\nhim, he could revel in a spectacle which no previous astronomer had ever\r\nbeen permitted to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe glorious orb that was becoming so conspicuous an object was none\r\nother than the planet Jupiter, the largest of all the bodies existing\r\nwithin the influence of solar attraction. During the seven months that\r\nhad elapsed since its collision with the earth, the comet had been\r\ncontinuously approaching the planet, until the distance between them was\r\nscarcely more than 61,000,000 leagues, and this would go on diminishing\r\nuntil the 15th of October.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, was it perfectly certain that no danger\r\ncould accrue? Was not Gallia, when its pathway led it into such close\r\nproximity to this enormous planet, running a risk of being attracted\r\nwithin its influence? Might not that influence be altogether disastrous?\r\nThe professor, it is true, in his estimate of the duration of his\r\ncomet’s revolution, had represented that he had made all proper\r\nallowances for any perturbations that would be caused either by\r\nJupiter, by Saturn, or by Mars; but what if there were any errors in\r\nhis calculations? what if there should be any elements of disturbance on\r\nwhich he had not reckoned?\r\n\r\nSpeculations of this kind became more and more frequent, and Lieutenant\r\nProcope pointed out that the danger incurred might be of a fourfold\r\ncharacter: first, that the comet, being irresistibly attracted, might\r\nbe drawn on to the very surface of the planet, and there annihilated;\r\nsecondly, that as the result of being brought under that attraction, it\r\nmight be transformed into a satellite, or even a sub-satellite, of that\r\nmighty world; thirdly, that it might be diverted into a new orbit, which\r\nwould never be coincident with the ecliptic; or, lastly, its course\r\nmight be so retarded that it would only reach the ecliptic too late to\r\npermit any junction with the earth. The occurrence of any one of these\r\ncontingencies would be fatal to their hopes of reunion with the globe,\r\nfrom which they had been so strangely severed.\r\n\r\nTo Rosette, who, without family ties which he had never found leisure or\r\ninclination to contract, had no shadow of desire to return to the earth,\r\nit would be only the first of these probabilities that could give him\r\nany concern. Total annihilation might not accord with his views, but he\r\nwould be quite content for Gallia to miss its mark with regard to\r\nthe earth, indifferent whether it revolved as a new satellite around\r\nJupiter, or whether it wended its course through the untraversed regions\r\nof the milky way. The rest of the community, however, by no means\r\nsympathized with the professor’s sentiments, and the following month was\r\na period of considerable doubt and anxiety.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of September the distance between Gallia and Jupiter was\r\nprecisely the same as the mean distance between the earth and the sun;\r\non the 16th, the distance was further reduced to 26,000,000 leagues. The\r\nplanet began to assume enormous dimensions, and it almost seemed as if\r\nthe comet had already been deflected from its elliptical orbit, and was\r\nrushing on in a straight line towards the overwhelming luminary.\r\n\r\nThe more they contemplated the character of this gigantic planet, the\r\nmore they became impressed with the likelihood of a serious perturbation\r\nin their own course. The diameter of Jupiter is 85,390 miles, nearly\r\neleven times as great as that of the earth; his volume is 1,387 times,\r\nand his mass 300 times greater; and although the mean density is only\r\nabout a quarter of that of the earth, and only a third of that of water\r\n(whence it has been supposed that the superficies of Jupiter is liquid),\r\nyet his other proportions were large enough to warrant the apprehension\r\nthat important disturbances might result from his proximity.\r\n\r\n“I forget my astronomy, lieutenant,” said Servadac. “Tell me all you can\r\nabout this formidable neighbor.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant having refreshed his memory by reference to Flammarion’s\r\n_Recits de l’Infini_, of which he had a Russian translation, and some\r\nother books, proceeded to recapitulate that Jupiter accomplishes his\r\nrevolution round the sun in 4,332 days 14 hours and 2 minutes; that he\r\ntravels at the rate of 467 miles a minute along an orbit measuring 2,976\r\nmillions of miles; and that his rotation on his axis occupies only 9\r\nhours and 55 minutes.\r\n\r\n“His days, then, are shorter than ours?” interrupted the captain.\r\n\r\n“Considerably,” answered the lieutenant, who went on to describe how the\r\ndisplacement of a point at the equator of Jupiter was twenty-seven times\r\nas rapid as on the earth, causing the polar compression to be about\r\n2,378 miles; how the axis, being nearly perpendicular, caused the\r\ndays and nights to be nearly of the same length, and the seasons to be\r\ninvariable; and how the amount of light and heat received by the planet\r\nis only a twenty-fifth part of that received by the earth, the average\r\ndistance from the sun being 475,693,000 miles.\r\n\r\n“And how about these satellites? Sometimes, I suppose, Jupiter has the\r\nbenefit of four moons all shining at once?” asked Servadac.\r\n\r\nOf the satellites, Lieutenant Procope went on to say that one is rather\r\nsmaller than our own moon; that another moves round its primary at an\r\ninterval about equal to the moon’s distance from ourselves; but that\r\nthey all revolve in considerably less time: the first takes only l day\r\n18 hours 27 minutes; the second takes 3 days 13 hours 14 minutes; the\r\nthird, 7 days 3 hours 42 minutes; whilst the largest of all takes but 16\r\ndays 16 hours 32 minutes. The most remote revolves round the planet at a\r\ndistance of 1,192,820 miles.\r\n\r\n“They have been enlisted into the service of science,” said Procope. “It\r\nis by their movements that the velocity of light has been calculated;\r\nand they have been made available for the determination of terrestrial\r\nlongitudes.”\r\n\r\n“It must be a wonderful sight,” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Procope. “I often think Jupiter is like a prodigious\r\nclock with four hands.”\r\n\r\n“I only hope that we are not destined to make a fifth hand,” answered\r\nServadac.\r\n\r\nSuch was the style of the conversation that was day by day reiterated\r\nduring the whole month of suspense. Whatever topic might be started, it\r\nseemed soon to settle down upon the huge orb that was looming upon them\r\nwith such threatening aspect.\r\n\r\n“The more remote that these planets are from the sun,” said Procope,\r\n“the more venerable and advanced in formation are they found to be.\r\nNeptune, situated 2,746,271,000 miles from the sun, issued from the\r\nsolar nebulosity, thousands of millions of centuries back. Uranus,\r\nrevolving 1,753,851,000 miles from the center of the planetary system,\r\nis of an age amounting to many hundred millions of centuries. Jupiter,\r\nthe colossal planet, gravitating at a distance of 475,693,000 miles,\r\nmay be reckoned as 70,000,000 centuries old. Mars has existed for\r\n1,000,000,000 years at a distance of 139,212,000 miles. The earth,\r\n91,430,000 miles from the sun, quitted his burning bosom 100,000,000\r\nyears ago. Venus, revolving now 66,131,000 miles away, may be assigned\r\nthe age of 50,000,000 years at least; and Mercury, nearest of all, and\r\nyoungest of all, has been revolving at a distance of 35,393,000 miles\r\nfor the space of 10,000,000 years--the same time as the moon has been\r\nevolved from the earth.”\r\n\r\nServadac listened attentively. He was at a loss what to say; and the\r\nonly reply he made to the recital of this novel theory was to the effect\r\nthat, if it were true, he would prefer being captured by Mercury than\r\nby Jupiter, for Mercury, being so much the younger, would probably prove\r\nthe less imperative and self-willed master.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 1st of September that the comet had crossed the orbit of\r\nJupiter, and on the 1st of October the two bodies were calculated to\r\nbe at their minimum separation. No direct shock, however, could be\r\napprehended; the demonstration was sufficiently complete that the orbit\r\nof Gallia did not coincide with that of the planet, the orbit of Jupiter\r\nbeing inclined at an angle of 1 degrees 19 mins to the orbit of the\r\nearth, with which that of Gallia was, no doubt, coincident.\r\n\r\nAs the month of September verged towards its close, Jupiter began\r\nto wear an aspect that must have excited the admiration of the most\r\nignorant or the most indifferent observer. Its salient points were\r\nillumined with novel and radiant tints, and the solar rays, reflected\r\nfrom its disc, glowed with a mingled softness and intensity upon Gallia,\r\nso that Nerina had to pale her beauty.\r\n\r\nWho could wonder that Rosette, enthusiast as he was, should be\r\nirremovable from his observatory? Who could expect otherwise than that,\r\nwith the prospect before him of viewing the giant among planets, ten\r\ntimes nearer than any mortal eye had ever done, he should have begrudged\r\nevery moment that distracted his attention?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as Jupiter grew large, the sun grew small.\r\n\r\nFrom its increased remoteness the diameter of the sun’s disc was\r\ndiminished to 5 degrees 46 mins.\r\n\r\nAnd what an increased interest began to be associated with the\r\nsatellites! They were visible to the naked eye! Was it not a new record\r\nin the annals of science?\r\n\r\nAlthough it is acknowledged that they are not ordinarily visible on\r\nearth without the aid of a somewhat powerful telescope, it has been\r\nasserted that a favored few, endued with extraordinary powers of vision,\r\nhave been able to identify them with an unassisted eye; but here,\r\nat least, in Nina’s Hive were many rivals, for everyone could so far\r\ndistinguish them one from the other as to describe them by their colors.\r\nThe first was of a dull white shade; the second was blue; the third was\r\nwhite and brilliant; the fourth was orange, at times approaching to\r\na red. It was further observed that Jupiter itself was almost void of\r\nscintillation.\r\n\r\nRosette, in his absorbing interest for the glowing glories of the\r\nplanet, seemed to be beguiled into comparative forgetfulness of the\r\ncharms of his comet; but no astronomical enthusiasm of the professor\r\ncould quite allay the general apprehension that some serious collision\r\nmight be impending.\r\n\r\nTime passed on. There was nothing to justify apprehension. The question\r\nwas continually being asked, “What does the professor really think?”\r\n\r\n“Our friend the professor,” said Servadac, “is not likely to tell us\r\nvery much; but we may feel pretty certain of one thing: he wouldn’t keep\r\nus long in the dark, if he thought we were not going back to the earth\r\nagain. The greatest satisfaction he could have would be to inform us\r\nthat we had parted from the earth for ever.”\r\n\r\n“I trust from my very soul,” said the count, “that his prognostications\r\nare correct.”\r\n\r\n“The more I see of him, and the more I listen to him,” replied Servadac,\r\n“the more I become convinced that his calculations are based on a solid\r\nfoundation, and will prove correct to the minutest particular.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof here interrupted the conversation. “I have something on my\r\nmind,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Something on your mind? Out with it!” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“That telescope!” said the orderly; “it strikes me that that telescope\r\nwhich the old professor keeps pointed up at yonder big sun is bringing\r\nit down straight upon us.”\r\n\r\nThe captain laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n“Laugh, captain, if you like; but I feel disposed to break the old\r\ntelescope into atoms.”\r\n\r\n“Ben Zoof,” said Servadac, his laughter exchanged for a look of stern\r\ndispleasure, “touch that telescope, and you shall swing for it!”\r\n\r\nThe orderly looked astonished.\r\n\r\n“I am governor here,” said Servadac.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof knew what his master meant, and to him his master’s wish was\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe interval between the comet and Jupiter was, by the 1st of October,\r\nreduced to 43,000,000 miles. The belts all parallel to Jupiter’s equator\r\nwere very distinct in their markings. Those immediately north and\r\nsouth of the equator were of a dusky hue; those toward the poles were\r\nalternately dark and light; the intervening spaces of the planet’s\r\nsuperficies, between edge and edge, being intensely bright. The belts\r\nthemselves were occasionally broken by spots, which the records of\r\nastronomy describe as varying both in form and in extent.\r\n\r\nThe physiology of belts and spots alike was beyond the astronomer’s\r\npower to ascertain; and even if he should be destined once again to take\r\nhis place in an astronomical congress on the earth, he would be just as\r\nincapable as ever of determining whether or no they owed their existence\r\nto the external accumulation of vapor, or to some internal agency. It\r\nwould not be Professor Rosette’s lot to enlighten his brother _savants_\r\nto any great degree as to the mysteries that are associated with this,\r\nwhich must ever rank as one of the most magnificent amongst the heavenly\r\norbs.\r\n\r\nAs the comet approached the critical point of its career it cannot be\r\ndenied that there was an unacknowledged consciousness of alarm. Mutually\r\nreserved, though ever courteous, the count and the captain were secretly\r\ndrawn together by the prospect of a common danger; and as their return\r\nto the earth appeared to them to become more and more dubious, they\r\nabandoned their views of narrow isolation, and tried to embrace the\r\nwider philosophy that acknowledges the credibility of a habitable\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nBut no philosophy could be proof against the common instincts of their\r\nhumanity; their hearts, their hopes, were set upon their natural home;\r\nno speculation, no science, no experience, could induce them to give up\r\ntheir fond and sanguine anticipation that once again they were to come\r\nin contact with the earth.\r\n\r\n“Only let us escape Jupiter,” said Lieutenant Procope, repeatedly, “and\r\nwe are free from anxiety.”\r\n\r\n“But would not Saturn lie ahead?” asked Servadac and the count in one\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n“No!” said Procope; “the orbit of Saturn is remote, and does not come\r\nathwart our path. Jupiter is our sole hindrance. Of Jupiter we must say,\r\nas William Tell said, ‘Once through the ominous pass and all is well.’”\r\n\r\nThe 15th of October came, the date of the nearest approximation of the\r\ncomet to the planet. They were only 31,000,000 miles apart. What would\r\nnow transpire? Would Gallia be diverted from its proper way? or would it\r\nhold the course that the astronomer had predicted?\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the captain ventured to take the count and the\r\nlieutenant up to the observatory. The professor was in the worst of\r\ntempers.\r\n\r\nThat was enough. It was enough, without a word, to indicate the course\r\nwhich events had taken. The comet was pursuing an unaltered way.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer, correct in his prognostications, ought to have been the\r\nmost proud and contented of philosophers; his pride and contentment\r\nwere both overshadowed by the certainty that the career of his comet was\r\ndestined to be so transient, and that it must inevitably once again come\r\ninto collision with the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX MARKET PRICES IN GALLIA\r\n\r\n\r\n“All right!” said Servadac, convinced by the professor’s ill humor that\r\nthe danger was past; “no doubt we are in for a two years’ excursion, but\r\nfifteen months more will take us back to the earth!”\r\n\r\n“And we shall see Montmartre again!” exclaimed Ben Zoof, in excited\r\ntones that betrayed his delight in the anticipation.\r\n\r\nTo use a nautical expression, they had safely “rounded the point,” and\r\nthey had to be congratulated on their successful navigation; for if,\r\nunder the influence of Jupiter’s attraction, the comet had been retarded\r\nfor a single hour, in that hour the earth would have already traveled\r\n2,300,000 miles from the point where contact would ensue, and many\r\ncenturies would elapse before such a coincidence would possibly again\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of November Gallia and Jupiter were 40,000,000 miles apart.\r\nIt was little more than ten weeks to the 15th of January, when the\r\ncomet would begin to re-approach the sun. Though light and heat were now\r\nreduced to a twenty-fifth part of their terrestrial intensity, so that\r\na perpetual twilight seemed to have settled over Gallia, yet the\r\npopulation felt cheered even by the little that was left, and buoyed\r\nup by the hope that they should ultimately regain their proper position\r\nwith regard to the great luminary, of which the temperature has been\r\nestimated as not less than 5,000,000 degrees.\r\n\r\nOf the anxiety endured during the last two months Isaac Hakkabut had\r\nknown nothing. Since the day he had done his lucky stroke of business he\r\nhad never left the tartan; and after Ben Zoof, on the following day, had\r\nreturned the steelyard and the borrowed cash, receiving back the paper\r\nroubles deposited, all communication between the Jew and Nina’s Hive had\r\nceased. In the course of the few minutes’ conversation which Ben Zoof\r\nhad held with him, he had mentioned that he knew that the whole soil of\r\nGallia was made of gold; but the old man, guessing that the orderly was\r\nonly laughing at him as usual, paid no attention to the remark, and only\r\nmeditated upon the means he could devise to get every bit of the money\r\nin the new world into his own possession. No one grieved over the\r\nlife of solitude which Hakkabut persisted in leading. Ben Zoof giggled\r\nheartily, as he repeatedly observed “it was astonishing how they\r\nreconciled themselves to his absence.”\r\n\r\nThe time came, however, when various circumstances prompted him to think\r\nhe must renew his intercourse with the inhabitants of the Hive. Some of\r\nhis goods were beginning to spoil, and he felt the necessity of turning\r\nthem into money, if he would not be a loser; he hoped, moreover, that\r\nthe scarcity of his commodities would secure very high prices.\r\n\r\nIt happened, just about this same time, that Ben Zoof had been calling\r\nhis master’s attention to the fact that some of their most necessary\r\nprovisions would soon be running short, and that their stock of coffee,\r\nsugar, and tobacco would want replenishing. Servadac’s mind, of course,\r\nturned to the cargo on board the _Hansa_, and he resolved, according to\r\nhis promise, to apply to the Jew and become a purchaser. Mutual interest\r\nand necessity thus conspired to draw Hakkabut and the captain together.\r\n\r\nOften and often had Isaac gloated in his solitude over the prospect of\r\nfirst selling a portion of his merchandise for all the gold and silver\r\nin the colony. His recent usurious transaction had whetted his appetite.\r\nHe would next part with some more of his cargo for all the paper money\r\nthey could give him; but still he should have goods left, and they would\r\nwant these. Yes, they should have these, too, for promissory notes.\r\nNotes would hold good when they got back again to the earth; bills from\r\nhis Excellency the governor would be good bills; anyhow there would\r\nbe the sheriff. By the God of Israel! he would get good prices, and he\r\nwould get fine interest!\r\n\r\nAlthough he did not know it, he was proposing to follow the practice of\r\nthe Gauls of old, who advanced money on bills for payment in a future\r\nlife. Hakkabut’s “future life,” however, was not many months in advance\r\nof the present.\r\n\r\nStill Hakkabut hesitated to make the first advance, and it was\r\naccordingly with much satisfaction that he hailed Captain Servadac’s\r\nappearance on board the _Hansa_.\r\n\r\n“Hakkabut,” said the captain, plunging without further preface into\r\nbusiness, “we want some coffee, some tobacco, and other things. I have\r\ncome to-day to order them, to settle the price, and to-morrow Ben Zoof\r\nshall fetch the goods away.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful, heavens!” the Jew began to whine; but Servadac cut him short.\r\n\r\n“None of that miserable howling! Business! I am come to buy your goods.\r\nI shall pay for them.”\r\n\r\n“Ah yes, your Excellency,” whispered the Jew, his voice trembling like\r\na street beggar. “Don’t impose on me. I am poor; I am nearly ruined\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“Cease your wretched whining!” cried Servadac. “I have told you once, I\r\nshall pay for all I buy.”\r\n\r\n“Ready money?” asked Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ready money. What makes you ask?” said the captain, curious to\r\nhear what the Jew would say.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see--you see, your Excellency,” stammered out the Jew, “to\r\ngive credit to one wouldn’t do, unless I gave credit to another. You are\r\nsolvent--I mean honorable, and his lordship the count is honorable; but\r\nmaybe--maybe--”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Servadac, waiting, but inclined to kick the old rascal out\r\nof his sight.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t like to give credit,” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“I have not asked you for credit. I have told you, you shall have ready\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, your Excellency. But how will you pay me?”\r\n\r\n“Pay you? Why, we shall pay you in gold and silver and copper, while our\r\nmoney lasts, and when that is gone we shall pay you in bank notes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no paper, no paper!” groaned out the Jew, relapsing into his\r\naccustomed whine.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, man!” cried Servadac.\r\n\r\n“No paper!” reiterated Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“Why not? Surely you can trust the banks of England, France, and\r\nRussia.”\r\n\r\n“Ah no! I must have gold. Nothing so safe as gold.”\r\n\r\n“Well then,” said the captain, not wanting to lose his temper, “you\r\nshall have it your own way; we have plenty of gold for the present.\r\nWe will leave the bank notes for by and by.” The Jew’s countenance\r\nbrightened, and Servadac, repeating that he should come again the next\r\nday, was about to quit the vessel.\r\n\r\n“One moment, your Excellency,” said Hakkabut, sidling up with a\r\nhypocritical smile; “I suppose I am to fix my own prices.”\r\n\r\n“You will, of course, charge ordinary prices--proper market prices;\r\nEuropean prices, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful heavens!” shrieked the old man, “you rob me of my rights; you\r\ndefraud me of my privilege. The monopoly of the market belongs to me. It\r\nis the custom; it is my right; it is my privilege to fix my own prices.”\r\n\r\nServadac made him understand that he had no intention of swerving from\r\nhis decision.\r\n\r\n“Merciful heavens!” again howled the Jew, “it is sheer ruin. The time of\r\nmonopoly is the time for profit; it is the time for speculation.”\r\n\r\n“The very thing, Hakkabut, that I am anxious to prevent. Just stop now,\r\nand think a minute. You seem to forget _my_ rights; you are forgetting\r\nthat, if I please, I can confiscate all your cargo for the common\r\nuse. You ought to think yourself lucky in getting any price at all. Be\r\ncontented with European prices; you will get no more. I am not going\r\nto waste my breath on you. I will come again to-morrow;” and, without\r\nallowing Hakkabut time to renew his lamentations, Servadac went away.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the day the Jew was muttering bitter curses against\r\nthe thieves of Gentiles in general, and the governor of Gallia in\r\nparticular, who were robbing him of his just profits, by binding him\r\ndown to a maximum price for his goods, just as if it were a time of\r\nrevolution in the state. But he would be even with them yet; he would\r\nhave it all out of them: he would make European prices pay, after all.\r\nHe had a plan--he knew how; and he chuckled to himself, and grinned\r\nmaliciously.\r\n\r\nTrue to his word, the captain next morning arrived at the tartan. He\r\nwas accompanied by Ben Zoof and two Russian sailors. “Good-morning, old\r\nEleazar; we have come to do our little bit of friendly business with\r\nyou, you know,” was Ben Zoof’s greeting.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to-day?” asked the Jew.\r\n\r\n“To-day we want coffee, and we want sugar, and we want tobacco. We must\r\nhave ten kilogrammes of each. Take care they are all good; all first\r\nrate. I am commissariat officer, and I am responsible.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you were the governor’s aide-de-camp,” said Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“So I am, on state occasions; but to-day, I tell you. I am\r\nsuperintendent of the commissariat department. Now, look sharp!”\r\n\r\nHakkabut hereupon descended into the hold of the tartan, and soon\r\nreturned, carrying ten packets of tobacco, each weighing one kilogramme,\r\nand securely fastened by strips of paper, labeled with the French\r\ngovernment stamp.\r\n\r\n“Ten kilogrammes of tobacco at twelve francs a kilogramme: a hundred and\r\ntwenty francs,” said the Jew.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof was on the point of laying down the money, when Servadac\r\nstopped him.\r\n\r\n“Let us just see whether the weight is correct.”\r\n\r\nHakkabut pointed out that the weight was duly registered on every\r\npacket, and that the packets had never been unfastened. The captain,\r\nhowever, had his own special object in view, and would not be diverted.\r\nThe Jew fetched his steelyard, and a packet of the tobacco was suspended\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n“Merciful heavens!” screamed Isaac.\r\n\r\nThe index registered only 133 grammes!\r\n\r\n“You see, Hakkabut, I was right. I was perfectly justified in having\r\nyour goods put to the test,” said Servadac, quite seriously.\r\n\r\n“But--but, your Excellency--” stammered out the bewildered man.\r\n\r\n“You will, of course, make up the deficiency,” the captain continued,\r\nnot noticing the interruption.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my lord, let me say--” began Isaac again.\r\n\r\n“Come, come, old Caiaphas, do you hear? You are to make up the\r\ndeficiency,” exclaimed Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, yes; but--”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Israelite tried hard to speak, but his agitation\r\nprevented him. He understood well enough the cause of the phenomenon,\r\nbut he was overpowered by the conviction that the “cursed Gentiles”\r\n wanted to cheat him. He deeply regretted that he had not a pair of\r\ncommon scales on board.\r\n\r\n“Come, I say, old Jedediah, you are a long while making up what’s\r\nshort,” said Ben Zoof, while the Jew was still stammering on.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he recovered his power of articulation, Isaac began to pour\r\nout a medley of lamentations and petitions for mercy. The captain was\r\ninexorable. “Very sorry, you know, Hakkabut. It is not my fault that the\r\npacket is short weight; but I cannot pay for a kilogramme except I have\r\na kilogramme.”\r\n\r\nHakkabut pleaded for some consideration.\r\n\r\n“A bargain is a bargain,” said Servadac. “You must complete your\r\ncontract.”\r\n\r\nAnd, moaning and groaning, the miserable man was driven to make up the\r\nfull weight as registered by his own steelyard. He had to repeat the\r\nprocess with the sugar and coffee: for every kilogramme he had to weigh\r\nseven. Ben Zoof and the Russians jeered him most unmercifully.\r\n\r\n“I say, old Mordecai, wouldn’t you rather give your goods away, than\r\nsell them at this rate? I would.”\r\n\r\n“I say, old Pilate, a monopoly isn’t always a good thing, is it?”\r\n\r\n“I say, old Sepharvaim, what a flourishing trade you’re driving!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile seventy kilogrammes of each of the articles required were\r\nweighed, and the Jew for each seventy had to take the price of ten.\r\n\r\nAll along Captain Servadac had been acting only in jest. Aware that\r\nold Isaac was an utter hypocrite, he had no compunction in turning a\r\nbusiness transaction with him into an occasion for a bit of fun. But\r\nthe joke at an end, he took care that the Jew was properly paid all his\r\nlegitimate due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. FAR INTO SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nA month passed away. Gallia continued its course, bearing its little\r\npopulation onwards, so far removed from the ordinary influence of human\r\npassions that it might almost be said that its sole ostensible vice was\r\nrepresented by the greed and avarice of the miserable Jew.\r\n\r\nAfter all, they were but making a voyage--a strange, yet a transient,\r\nexcursion through solar regions hitherto untraversed; but if the\r\nprofessor’s calculations were correct--and why should they be\r\ndoubted?--their little vessel was destined, after a two years’ absence,\r\nonce more to return “to port.” The landing, indeed, might be a matter\r\nof difficulty; but with the good prospect before them of once again\r\nstanding on terrestrial shores, they had nothing to do at present\r\nexcept to make themselves as comfortable as they could in their present\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThus confident in their anticipations, neither the captain, the count,\r\nnor the lieutenant felt under any serious obligation to make any\r\nextensive provisions for the future; they saw no necessity for expending\r\nthe strength of the people, during the short summer that would intervene\r\nupon the long severity of winter, in the cultivation or the preservation\r\nof their agricultural resources. Nevertheless, they often found\r\nthemselves talking over the measures they would have been driven to\r\nadopt, if they had found themselves permanently attached to their\r\npresent home.\r\n\r\nEven after the turning-point in their career, they knew that at least\r\nnine months would have to elapse before the sea would be open to\r\nnavigation; but at the very first arrival of summer they would be bound\r\nto arrange for the _Dobryna_ and the _Hansa_ to retransport themselves\r\nand all their animals to the shores of Gourbi Island, where they would\r\nhave to commence their agricultural labors to secure the crops that must\r\nform their winter store. During four months or thereabouts, they would\r\nlead the lives of farmers and of sportsmen; but no sooner would their\r\nhaymaking and their corn harvest have been accomplished, than they\r\nwould be compelled again, like a swarm of bees, to retire to their\r\nsemi-troglodyte existence in the cells of Nina’s Hive.\r\n\r\nNow and then the captain and his friends found themselves speculating\r\nwhether, in the event of their having to spend another winter upon\r\nGallia, some means could not be devised by which the dreariness of a\r\nsecond residence in the recesses of the volcano might be escaped. Would\r\nnot another exploring expedition possibly result in the discovery of\r\na vein of coal or other combustible matter, which could be turned to\r\naccount in warming some erection which they might hope to put up?\r\nA prolonged existence in their underground quarters was felt to be\r\nmonotonous and depressing, and although it might be all very well for a\r\nman like Professor Rosette, absorbed in astronomical studies, it was ill\r\nsuited to the temperaments of any of themselves for any longer period\r\nthan was absolutely indispensable.\r\n\r\nOne contingency there was, almost too terrible to be taken into account.\r\nWas it not to be expected that the time might come when the internal\r\nfires of Gallia would lose their activity, and the stream of lava would\r\nconsequently cease to flow? Why should Gallia be exempt from the destiny\r\nthat seemed to await every other heavenly body? Why should it not roll\r\nonwards, like the moon, a dark cold mass in space?\r\n\r\nIn the event of such a cessation of the volcanic eruption, whilst the\r\ncomet was still at so great a distance from the sun, they would indeed\r\nbe at a loss to find a substitute for what alone had served to render\r\nlife endurable at a temperature of 60 degrees below zero. Happily,\r\nhowever, there was at present no symptom of the subsidence of the lava’s\r\nstream; the volcano continued its regular and unchanging discharge, and\r\nServadac, ever sanguine, declared that it was useless to give themselves\r\nany anxiety upon the matter.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of December, Gallia was 276,000,000 leagues from the sun,\r\nand, as it was approximately to the extremity of its axis major, would\r\ntravel only some 11,000,000 or 12,000,000 leagues during the month.\r\nAnother world was now becoming a conspicuous object in the heavens, and\r\nPalmyrin Rosette, after rejoicing in an approach nearer to Jupiter than\r\nany other mortal man had ever attained, was now to be privileged to\r\nenjoy a similar opportunity of contemplating the planet Saturn. Not\r\nthat the circumstances were altogether so favorable. Scarcely 31,000,000\r\nmiles had separated Gallia from Jupiter; the minimum distance of Saturn\r\nwould not be less than 415,000,000 miles; but even this distance,\r\nalthough too great to affect the comet’s progress more than had been\r\nduly reckoned on, was considerably shorter than what had ever separated\r\nSaturn from the earth.\r\n\r\nTo get any information about the planet from Rosette appeared quite\r\nimpossible. Although equally by night and by day he never seemed to quit\r\nhis telescope, he did not evince the slightest inclination to impart the\r\nresult of his observations. It was only from the few astronomical works\r\nthat happened to be included in the _Dobryna’s_ library that any details\r\ncould be gathered, but these were sufficient to give a large amount of\r\ninteresting information.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof, when he was made aware that the earth would be invisible to\r\nthe naked eye from the surface of Saturn, declared that he then, for his\r\npart, did not care to learn any more about such a planet; to him it\r\nwas indispensable that the earth should remain in sight, and it was his\r\ngreat consolation that hitherto his native sphere had never vanished\r\nfrom his gaze.\r\n\r\nAt this date Saturn was revolving at a distance of 420,000,000 miles\r\nfrom Gallia, and consequently 874,440,000 miles from the sun, receiving\r\nonly a hundredth part of the light and heat which that luminary bestows\r\nupon the earth. On consulting their books of reference, the colonists\r\nfound that Saturn completes his revolution round the sun in a period of\r\n29 years and 167 days, traveling at the rate of more than 21,000 miles\r\nan hour along an orbit measuring 5,490 millions of miles in length. His\r\ncircumference is about 220,000 miles; his superficies, 144,000 millions\r\nof square miles; his volume, 143,846 millions of cubic miles. Saturn\r\nis 735 times larger than the earth, consequently he is smaller than\r\nJupiter; in mass he is only 90 times greater than the earth, which gives\r\nhim a density less than that of water. He revolves on his axis in 10\r\nhours 29 minutes, causing his own year to consist of 86,630 days; and\r\nhis seasons, on account of the great inclination of his axis to the\r\nplane of his orbit, are each of the length of seven terrestrial years.\r\n\r\nAlthough the light received from the sun is comparatively feeble, the\r\nnights upon Saturn must be splendid. Eight satellites--Mimas, Enceladus,\r\nTethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, and Japetus--accompany the planet;\r\nMimas, the nearest to its primary, rotating on its axis in 22 1/2 hours,\r\nand revolving at a distance of only 120,800 miles, whilst Japetus,\r\nthe most remote, occupies 79 days in its rotation, and revolves at a\r\ndistance of 2,314,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAnother most important contribution to the magnificence of the nights\r\nupon Saturn is the triple ring with which, as a brilliant setting, the\r\nplanet is encompassed. To an observer at the equator, this ring, which\r\nhas been estimated by Sir William Herschel as scarcely 100 miles in\r\nthickness, must have the appearance of a narrow band of light passing\r\nthrough the zenith 12,000 miles above his head. As the observer,\r\nhowever, increases his latitude either north or south, the band will\r\ngradually widen out into three detached and concentric rings, of which\r\nthe innermost, dark though transparent, is 9,625 miles in breadth; the\r\nintermediate one, which is brighter than the planet itself, being 17,605\r\nmiles broad; and the outer, of a dusky hue, being 8,660 miles broad.\r\n\r\nSuch, they read, is the general outline of this strange appendage, which\r\nrevolves in its own plane in 10 hours 32 minutes. Of what matter it\r\nis composed, and how it resists disintegration, is still an unsettled\r\nquestion; but it might almost seem that the Designer of the universe, in\r\npermitting its existence, had been willing to impart to His intelligent\r\ncreatures the manner in which celestial bodies are evolved, and that\r\nthis remarkable ring-system is a remnant of the nebula from which Saturn\r\nwas himself developed, and which, from some unknown cause, has become\r\nsolidified. If at any time it should disperse, it would either fall\r\ninto fragments upon the surface of Saturn, or the fragments, mutually\r\ncoalescing, would form additional satellites to circle round the planet\r\nin its path.\r\n\r\nTo any observer stationed on the planet, between the extremes of lat.\r\n45 degrees on either side of the equator, these wonderful rings would\r\npresent various strange phenomena. Sometimes they would appear as an\r\nilluminated arch, with the shadow of Saturn passing over it like the\r\nhour-hand over a dial; at other times they would be like a semi-aureole\r\nof light. Very often, too, for periods of several years, daily eclipses\r\nof the sun must occur through the interposition of this triple ring.\r\n\r\nTruly, with the constant rising and setting of the satellites, some with\r\nbright discs at their full, others like silver crescents, in quadrature,\r\nas well as by the encircling rings, the aspect of the heavens from the\r\nsurface of Saturn must be as impressive as it is gorgeous.\r\n\r\nUnable, indeed, the Gallians were to realize all the marvels of this\r\nstrange world. After all, they were practically a thousand times further\r\noff than the great astronomers have been able to approach by means of\r\ntheir giant telescopes. But they did not complain; their little comet,\r\nthey knew, was far safer where it was; far better out of the reach of an\r\nattraction which, by affecting their path, might have annihilated their\r\nbest hopes.\r\n\r\nThe distances of several of the brightest of the fixed stars have\r\nbeen estimated. Amongst others, Vega in the constellation Lyra is 100\r\nmillions of millions of miles away; Sirius in Canis Major, 123 millions\r\nof millions; the Pole-star, 282 millions of millions; and Capella, 340\r\nmillions of millions of miles, a figure represented by no less than\r\nfifteen digits.\r\n\r\nThe hard numerical statement of these enormous figures, however,\r\nfails altogether in any adequate way to convey a due impression of the\r\nmagnitude of these distances. Astronomers, in their ingenuity, have\r\nendeavored to use some other basis, and have found “the velocity\r\nof light” to be convenient for their purpose. They have made their\r\nrepresentations something in this way:\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” they say, “an observer endowed with an infinite length of\r\nvision: suppose him stationed on the surface of Capella; looking thence\r\ntowards the earth, he would be a spectator of events that had happened\r\nseventy years previously; transport him to a star ten times distant, and\r\nhe will be reviewing the terrestrial sphere of 720 years back; carry him\r\naway further still, to a star so remote that it requires something less\r\nthan nineteen centuries for light to reach it, and he would be a witness\r\nof the birth and death of Christ; convey him further again, and he\r\nshall be looking upon the dread desolation of the Deluge; take him away\r\nfurther yet (for space is infinite), and he shall be a spectator of the\r\nCreation of the spheres. History is thus stereotyped in space; nothing\r\nonce accomplished can ever be effaced.”\r\n\r\nWho can altogether be astonished that Palmyrin Rosette, with his burning\r\nthirst for astronomical research, should have been conscious of a\r\nlonging for yet wider travel through the sidereal universe? With his\r\ncomet now under the influence of one star, now of another, what various\r\nsystems might he not have explored! what undreamed-of marvels might not\r\nhave revealed themselves before his gaze! The stars, fixed and immovable\r\nin name, are all of them in motion, and Gallia might have followed them\r\nin their un-tracked way.\r\n\r\nBut Gallia had a narrow destiny. She was not to be allowed to wander\r\naway into the range of attraction of another center; nor to mingle with\r\nthe star clusters, some of which have been entirely, others partially\r\nresolved; nor was she to lose herself amongst the 5,000 nebulae which\r\nhave resisted hitherto the grasp of the most powerful reflectors. No;\r\nGallia was neither to pass beyond the limits of the solar system, nor\r\nto travel out of sight of the terrestrial sphere. Her orbit was\r\ncircumscribed to little over 1,500 millions of miles; and, in comparison\r\nwith the infinite space beyond, this was a mere nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. A FETE DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe temperature continued to decrease; the mercurial thermometer, which\r\nfreezes at 42 degrees below zero, was no longer of service, and the\r\nspirit thermometer of the _Dobryna_ had been brought into use. This now\r\nregistered 53 degrees below freezing-point.\r\n\r\nIn the creek, where the two vessels had been moored for the winter, the\r\nelevation of the ice, in anticipation of which Lieutenant Procope had\r\ntaken the precautionary measure of beveling, was going on slowly but\r\nirresistibly, and the tartan was upheaved fifty feet above the level of\r\nthe Gallian Sea, while the schooner, as being lighter, had been raised\r\nto a still greater altitude.\r\n\r\nSo irresistible was this gradual process of elevation, so utterly\r\ndefying all human power to arrest, that the lieutenant began to feel\r\nvery anxious as to the safety of his yacht. With the exception of the\r\nengine and the masts, everything had been cleared out and conveyed to\r\nshore, but in the event of a thaw it appeared that nothing short of a\r\nmiracle could prevent the hull from being dashed to pieces, and then all\r\nmeans of leaving the promontory would be gone. The _Hansa_, of course,\r\nwould share a similar fate; in fact, it had already heeled over to such\r\nan extent as to render it quite dangerous for its obstinate owner, who,\r\nat the peril of his life, resolved that he would stay where he could\r\nwatch over his all-precious cargo, though continually invoking curses on\r\nthe ill-fate of which he deemed himself the victim.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a stronger will than Isaac Hakkabut’s. Although no\r\none of all the community cared at all for the safety of the Jew, they\r\ncared very much for the security of his cargo, and when Servadac found\r\nthat nothing would induce the old man to abandon his present quarters\r\nvoluntarily, he very soon adopted measures of coercion that were far\r\nmore effectual than any representations of personal danger.\r\n\r\n“Stop where you like, Hakkabut,” said the captain to him; “but\r\nunderstand that I consider it my duty to make sure that your cargo is\r\ntaken care of. I am going to have it carried across to land, at once.”\r\n\r\nNeither groans, nor tears, nor protestations on the part of the Jew,\r\nwere of the slightest avail. Forthwith, on the 20th of December, the\r\nremoval of the goods commenced.\r\n\r\nBoth Spaniards and Russians were all occupied for several days in the\r\nwork of unloading the tartan. Well muffled up as they were in furs, they\r\nwere able to endure the cold with impunity, making it their special care\r\nto avoid actual contact with any article made of metal, which, in the\r\nlow state of the temperature, would inevitably have taken all the skin\r\noff their hands, as much as if it had been red-hot. The task, however,\r\nwas brought to an end without accident of any kind; and when the stores\r\nof the _Hansa_ were safely deposited in the galleries of the Hive,\r\nLieutenant Procope avowed that he really felt that his mind had been\r\nunburdened from a great anxiety.\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac gave old Isaac full permission to take up his residence\r\namongst the rest of the community, promised him the entire control over\r\nhis own property, and altogether showed him so much consideration that,\r\nbut for his unbounded respect for his master, Ben Zoof would have\r\nliked to reprimand him for his courtesy to a man whom he so cordially\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hakkabut clamored most vehemently about his goods being carried\r\noff “against his will,” in his heart he was more than satisfied to see\r\nhis property transferred to a place of safety, and delighted, moreover,\r\nto know that the transport had been effected without a farthing of\r\nexpense to himself. As soon, then, as he found the tartan empty, he was\r\nonly too glad to accept the offer that had been made him, and very soon\r\nmade his way over to the quarters in the gallery where his merchandise\r\nhad been stored. Here he lived day and night. He supplied himself with\r\nwhat little food he required from his own stock of provisions, a small\r\nspirit-lamp sufficing to perform all the operations of his meager\r\ncookery. Consequently all intercourse between himself and the rest of\r\nthe inhabitants was entirely confined to business transactions, when\r\noccasion required that some purchase should be made from his stock\r\nof commodities. Meanwhile, all the silver and gold of the colony was\r\ngradually finding its way to a double-locked drawer, of which the Jew\r\nmost carefully guarded the key.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of January was drawing near, the anniversary of the shock\r\nwhich had resulted in the severance of thirty-six human beings from the\r\nsociety of their fellow-men. Hitherto, not one of them was missing. The\r\nunvarying calmness of the climate, notwithstanding the cold, had tended\r\nto maintain them in good health, and there seemed no reason to doubt\r\nthat, when Gallia returned to the earth, the total of its little\r\npopulation would still be complete.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of January, it is true, was not properly “New Year’s Day” in\r\nGallia, but Captain Servadac, nevertheless, was very anxious to have it\r\nobserved as a holiday.\r\n\r\n“I do not think,” he said to Count Timascheff and Lieutenant Procope,\r\n“that we ought to allow our people to lose their interest in the world\r\nto which we are all hoping to return; and how can we cement the bond\r\nthat ought to unite us, better than by celebrating, in common with our\r\nfellow-creatures upon earth, a day that awakens afresh the kindliest\r\nsentiments of all? Besides,” he added, smiling, “I expect that Gallia,\r\nalthough invisible just at present to the naked eye, is being closely\r\nwatched by the telescopes of our terrestrial friends, and I have no\r\ndoubt that the newspapers and scientific journals of both hemispheres\r\nare full of accounts detailing the movements of the new comet.”\r\n\r\n“True,” asserted the count. “I can quite imagine that we are occasioning\r\nno small excitement in all the chief observatories.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, more than that,” said the lieutenant; “our Gallia is certain to\r\nbe far more than a mere object of scientific interest or curiosity. Why\r\nshould we doubt that the elements of a comet which has once come into\r\ncollision with the earth have by this time been accurately calculated?\r\nWhat our friend the professor has done here, has been done likewise on\r\nthe earth, where, beyond a question, all manner of expedients are being\r\ndiscussed as to the best way of mitigating the violence of a concussion\r\nthat must occur.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant’s conjectures were so reasonable that they commanded\r\nassent. Gallia could scarcely be otherwise than an object of terror to\r\nthe inhabitants of the earth, who could by no means be certain that a\r\nsecond collision would be comparatively so harmless as the first. Even\r\nto the Gallians themselves, much as they looked forward to the event,\r\nthe prospect was not unmixed with alarm, and they would rejoice in the\r\ninvention of any device by which it was likely the impetus of the shock\r\nmight be deadened.\r\n\r\nChristmas arrived, and was marked by appropriate religious observance\r\nby everyone in the community, with the exception of the Jew, who made\r\na point of secluding himself more obstinately than ever in the gloomy\r\nrecesses of his retreat.\r\n\r\nTo Ben Zoof the last week of the year was full of bustle. The\r\narrangements for the New Year _fete_ were entrusted to him, and he was\r\nanxious, in spite of the resources of Gallia being so limited, to make\r\nthe program for the great day as attractive as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of debate that night whether the professor should be\r\ninvited to join the party; it was scarcely likely that he would care\r\nto come, but, on the whole, it was felt to be advisable to ask him. At\r\nfirst Captain Servadac thought of going in person with the invitation;\r\nbut, remembering Rosette’s dislike to visitors, he altered his mind, and\r\nsent young Pablo up to the observatory with a formal note, requesting\r\nthe pleasure of Professor Rosette’s company at the New Year’s _fete_.\r\n\r\nPablo was soon back, bringing no answer except that the professor had\r\ntold him that “to-day was the 125th of June, and that to-morrow would be\r\nthe 1st of July.”\r\n\r\nConsequently, Servadac and the count took it for granted that Palmyrin\r\nRosette declined their invitation.\r\n\r\nAn hour after sunrise on New Year’s Day, Frenchmen, Russians, Spaniards,\r\nand little Nina, as the representative of Italy, sat down to a feast\r\nsuch as never before had been seen in Gallia. Ben Zoof and the Russian\r\ncook had quite surpassed themselves. The wines, part of the _Dobryna’s_\r\nstores, were of excellent quality. Those of the vintages of France and\r\nSpain were drunk in toasting their respective countries, and even Russia\r\nwas honored in a similar way by means of a few bottles of kummel. The\r\ncompany was more than contented--it was as jovial as Ben Zoof could\r\ndesire; and the ringing cheers that followed the great toast of the\r\nday--“A happy return to our Mother Earth,” must fairly have startled the\r\nprofessor in the silence of his observatory.\r\n\r\nThe _dejeuner_ over, there still remained three hours of daylight. The\r\nsun was approaching the zenith, but so dim and enfeebled were his rays\r\nthat they were very unlike what had produced the wines of Bordeaux and\r\nBurgundy which they had just been enjoying, and it was necessary for\r\nall, before starting upon an excursion that would last over nightfall,\r\nto envelop themselves in the thickest of clothing.\r\n\r\nFull of spirits, the party left the Hive, and chattering and singing as\r\nthey went, made their way down to the frozen shore, where they fastened\r\non their skates. Once upon the ice, everyone followed his own fancy,\r\nand some singly, some in groups, scattered themselves in all directions.\r\nCaptain Servadac, the count, and the lieutenant were generally seen\r\ntogether. Negrete and the Spaniards, now masters of their novel\r\nexercise, wandered fleetly and gracefully hither and thither,\r\noccasionally being out of sight completely. The Russian sailors,\r\nfollowing a northern custom, skated in file, maintaining their rank by\r\nmeans of a long pole passed under their right arms, and in this way they\r\ndescribed a trackway of singular regularity. The two children, blithe\r\nas birds, flitted about, now singly, now arm-in-arm, now joining the\r\ncaptain’s party, now making a short peregrination by themselves, but\r\nalways full of life and spirit. As for Ben Zoof, he was here, there,\r\nand everywhere, his imperturbable good temper ensuring him a smile of\r\nwelcome whenever he appeared.\r\n\r\nThus coursing rapidly over the icy plain, the whole party had soon\r\nexceeded the line that made the horizon from the shore. First, the rocks\r\nof the coast were lost to view; then the white crests of the cliffs were\r\nno longer to be seen; and at last, the summit of the volcano, with its\r\ncorona of vapor, was entirely out of sight. Occasionally the skaters\r\nwere obliged to stop to recover their breath, but, fearful of\r\nfrost-bite, they almost instantly resumed their exercise, and proceeded\r\nnearly as far as Gourbi Island before they thought about retracing their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nBut night was coming on, and the sun was already sinking in the east\r\nwith the rapidity to which the residents on Gallia were by this time\r\nwell accustomed. The sunset upon this contracted horizon was very\r\nremarkable. There was not a cloud nor a vapor to catch the tints of the\r\ndeclining beams; the surface of the ice did not, as a liquid sea would,\r\nreflect the last green ray of light; but the radiant orb, enlarged by\r\nthe effect of refraction, its circumference sharply defined against the\r\nsky, sank abruptly, as though a trap had been opened in the ice for its\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nBefore the daylight ended. Captain Servadac had cautioned the party to\r\ncollect themselves betimes into one group. “Unless you are sure of your\r\nwhereabouts before dark,” he said, “you will not find it after. We have\r\ncome out like a party of skirmishers; let us go back in full force.”\r\n\r\nThe night would be dark; their moon was in conjunction, and would not be\r\nseen; the stars would only give something of that “pale radiance” which\r\nthe poet Corneille has described.\r\n\r\nImmediately after sunset the torches were lighted, and the long series\r\nof flames, fanned by the rapid motion of their bearers, had much the\r\nappearance of an enormous fiery banner. An hour later, and the volcano\r\nappeared like a dim shadow on the horizon, the light from the crater\r\nshedding a lurid glare upon the surrounding gloom. In time the glow of\r\nthe burning lava, reflected in the icy mirror, fell upon the troop of\r\nskaters, and cast their lengthened shadows grotesquely on the surface of\r\nthe frozen sea.\r\n\r\nLater still, half an hour or more afterwards, the torches were all but\r\ndying out. The shore was close at hand. All at once, Ben Zoof uttered\r\na startled cry, and pointed with bewildered excitement towards the\r\nmountain. Involuntarily, one and all, they plowed their heels into the\r\nice and came to a halt. Exclamations of surprise and horror burst from\r\nevery lip. The volcano was extinguished! The stream of burning lava had\r\nsuddenly ceased to flow!\r\n\r\nSpeechless with amazement, they stood still for some moments. There was\r\nnot one of them that did not realize, more or less, how critical was\r\ntheir position. The sole source of the heat that had enabled them to\r\nbrave the rigor of the cold had failed them! death, in the cruellest of\r\nall shapes, seemed staring them in the face--death from cold! Meanwhile,\r\nthe last torch had flickered out.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark.\r\n\r\n“Forward!” cried Servadac, firmly.\r\n\r\nAt the word of command they advanced to the shore; clambered with\r\nno little difficulty up the slippery rocks; gained the mouth of the\r\ngallery; groped their way into the common hall.\r\n\r\nHow dreary! how chill it seemed!\r\n\r\nThe fiery cataract no longer spread its glowing covering over the mouth\r\nof the grotto. Lieutenant Procope leaned through the aperture. The pool,\r\nhitherto kept fluid by its proximity to the lava, was already encrusted\r\nwith a layer of ice.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of the New Year’s Day so happily begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. THE BOWELS OF THE COMET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole night was spent in speculating, with gloomy forebodings, upon\r\nthe chances of the future. The temperature of the hall, now entirely\r\nexposed to the outer air, was rapidly falling, and would quickly become\r\nunendurable. Far too intense was the cold to allow anyone to remain at\r\nthe opening, and the moisture on the walls soon resolved itself into\r\nicicles. But the mountain was like the body of a dying man, that retains\r\nawhile a certain amount of heat at the heart after the extremities have\r\nbecome cold and dead. In the more interior galleries there was still a\r\ncertain degree of warmth, and hither Servadac and his companions were\r\nglad enough to retreat.\r\n\r\nHere they found the professor, who, startled by the sudden cold, had\r\nbeen fain to make a precipitate retreat from his observatory. Now would\r\nhave been the opportunity to demand of the enthusiast whether he would\r\nlike to prolong his residence indefinitely upon his little comet. It is\r\nvery likely that he would have declared himself ready to put up with any\r\namount of discomfort to be able to gratify his love of investigation;\r\nbut all were far too disheartened and distressed to care to banter him\r\nupon the subject on which he was so sensitive.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Servadac thus addressed his people. “My friends, except\r\nfrom cold, we have nothing to fear. Our provisions are ample--more than\r\nenough for the remaining period of our sojourn in this lone world of\r\nours; our preserved meat is already cooked; we shall be able to\r\ndispense with all fuel for cooking purposes. All that we require is\r\nwarmth--warmth for ourselves; let us secure that, and all may be well.\r\nNow, I do not entertain a doubt but that the warmth we require is\r\nresident in the bowels of this mountain on which we are living; to\r\nthe depth of those bowels we must penetrate; there we shall obtain the\r\nwarmth which is indispensable to our very existence.”\r\n\r\nHis tone, quite as much as his words, restored confidence to many of his\r\npeople, who were already yielding to a feeling of despair. The count and\r\nthe lieutenant fervently, but silently, grasped his hand.\r\n\r\n“Nina,” said the captain, “you will not be afraid to go down to the\r\nlower depths of the mountain, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Not if Pablo goes,” replied the child.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, of course, Pablo will go. You are not afraid to go, are you,\r\nPablo?” he said, addressing the boy.\r\n\r\n“Anywhere with you, your Excellency,” was the boy’s prompt reply.\r\n\r\nAnd certain it was that no time must be lost in penetrating below\r\nthe heart of the volcano; already the most protected of the many\r\nramifications of Nina’s Hive were being pervaded by a cold that was\r\ninsufferable. It was an acknowledged impossibility to get access to the\r\ncrater by the exterior declivities of the mountain-side; they were far\r\ntoo steep and too slippery to afford a foothold. It must of necessity be\r\nentered from the interior.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope accordingly undertook the task of exploring all the\r\ngalleries, and was soon able to report that he had discovered one which\r\nhe had every reason to believe abutted upon the central funnel. His\r\nreason for coming to this conclusion was that the caloric emitted by the\r\nrising vapors of the hot lava seemed to be oozing, as it were, out of\r\nthe tellurium, which had been demonstrated already to be a conductor\r\nof heat. Only succeed in piercing through this rock for seven or eight\r\nyards, and the lieutenant did not doubt that his way would be opened\r\ninto the old lava-course, by following which he hoped descent would be\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nUnder the lieutenant’s direction the Russian sailors were immediately\r\nset to work. Their former experience had convinced them that spades and\r\npick-axes were of no avail, and their sole resource was to proceed\r\nby blasting with gunpowder. However skillfully the operation might be\r\ncarried on, it must necessarily occupy several days, and during that\r\ntime the sufferings from cold must be very severe.\r\n\r\n“If we fail in our object, and cannot get to the depths of the mountain,\r\nour little colony is doomed,” said Count Timascheff.\r\n\r\n“That speech is not like yourself,” answered Servadac, smiling. “What\r\nhas become of the faith which has hitherto carried you so bravely\r\nthrough all our difficulties?”\r\n\r\nThe count shook his head, as if in despair, and said, sadly, “The Hand\r\nthat has hitherto been outstretched to help seems now to be withdrawn.”\r\n\r\n“But only to test our powers of endurance,” rejoined the captain,\r\nearnestly. “Courage, my friend, courage! Something tells me that this\r\ncessation of the eruption is only partial; the internal fire is not all\r\nextinct. All is not over yet. It is too soon to give up; never despair!”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope quite concurred with the captain. Many causes, he\r\nknew, besides the interruption of the influence of the oxygen upon the\r\nmineral substances in Gallia’s interior, might account for the stoppage\r\nof the lava-flow in this one particular spot, and he considered it more\r\nthan probable that a fresh outlet had been opened in some other part of\r\nthe surface, and that the eruptive matter had been diverted into the new\r\nchannel. But at present his business was to prosecute his labors so\r\nthat a retreat might be immediately effected from their now untenable\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nRestless and agitated, Professor Rosette, if he took any interest in\r\nthese discussions, certainly took no share in them. He had brought his\r\ntelescope down from the observatory into the common hall, and there at\r\nfrequent intervals, by night and by day, he would endeavor to continue\r\nhis observations; but the intense cold perpetually compelled him to\r\ndesist, or he would literally have been frozen to death. No sooner,\r\nhowever, did he find himself obliged to retreat from his study of the\r\nheavens, than he would begin overwhelming everybody about him with\r\nbitter complaints, pouring out his regrets that he had ever quitted his\r\nquarters at Formentera.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January, by persevering industry, the process of boring\r\nwas completed, and the lieutenant could hear that fragments of the\r\nblasted rock, as the sailors cleared them away with their spades, were\r\nrolling into the funnel of the crater. He noticed, too, that they did\r\nnot fall perpendicularly, but seemed to slide along, from which he\r\ninferred that the sides of the crater were sloping; he had therefore\r\nreason to hope that a descent would be found practicable.\r\n\r\nLarger and larger grew the orifice; at length it would admit a man’s\r\nbody, and Ben Zoof, carrying a torch, pushed himself through it,\r\nfollowed by the lieutenant and Servadac. Procope’s conjecture proved\r\ncorrect. On entering the crater, they found that the sides slanted at\r\nthe angle of about 4 degrees; moreover, the eruption had evidently been\r\nof recent origin, dating probably only from the shock which had invested\r\nGallia with a proportion of the atmosphere of the earth, and beneath\r\nthe coating of ashes with which they were covered, there were various\r\nirregularities in the rock, not yet worn away by the action of the lava,\r\nand these afforded a tolerably safe footing.\r\n\r\n“Rather a bad staircase!” said Ben Zoof, as they began to make their way\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour, proceeding in a southerly direction, they had\r\ndescended nearly five hundred feet. From time to time they came\r\nupon large excavations that at first sight had all the appearance of\r\ngalleries, but by waving his torch, Ben Zoof could always see their\r\nextreme limits, and it was evident that the lower strata of the mountain\r\ndid not present the same system of ramification that rendered the Hive\r\nabove so commodious a residence.\r\n\r\nIt was not a time to be fastidious; they must be satisfied with such\r\naccommodation as they could get, provided it was warm. Captain Servadac\r\nwas only too glad to find that his hopes about the temperature were to\r\na certain extent realized. The lower they went, the greater was the\r\ndiminution in the cold, a diminution that was far more rapid than that\r\nwhich is experienced in making the descent of terrestrial mines. In\r\nthis case it was a volcano, not a colliery, that was the object of\r\nexploration, and thankful enough they were to find that it had not\r\nbecome extinct. Although the lava, from some unknown cause, had\r\nceased to rise in the crater, yet plainly it existed somewhere in an\r\nincandescent state, and was still transmitting considerable heat to\r\ninferior strata.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Procope had brought in his hand a mercurial thermometer,\r\nand Servadac carried an aneroid barometer, by means of which he could\r\nestimate the depth of their descent below the level of the Gallian Sea.\r\nWhen they were six hundred feet below the orifice the mercury registered\r\na temperature of 6 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\n“Six degrees!” said Servadac; “that will not suit us. At this low\r\ntemperature we could not survive the winter. We must try deeper down. I\r\nonly hope the ventilation will hold out.”\r\n\r\nThere was, however, nothing to fear on the score of ventilation.\r\nThe great current of air that rushed into the aperture penetrated\r\neverywhere, and made respiration perfectly easy.\r\n\r\nThe descent was continued for about another three hundred feet, which\r\nbrought the explorers to a total depth of nine hundred feet from their\r\nold quarters. Here the thermometer registered 12 degrees above zero--a\r\ntemperature which, if only it were permanent, was all they wanted. There\r\nwas no advantage in proceeding any further along the lava-course; they\r\ncould already hear the dull rumblings that indicated that they were at\r\nno great distance from the central focus.\r\n\r\n“Quite near enough for me!” exclaimed Ben Zoof. “Those who are chilly\r\nare welcome to go as much lower as they like. For my part, I shall be\r\nquite warm enough here.”\r\n\r\nAfter throwing the gleams of torch-light in all directions, the\r\nexplorers seated themselves on a jutting rock, and began to debate\r\nwhether it was practicable for the colony to make an abode in these\r\nlower depths of the mountain. The prospect, it must be owned, was not\r\ninviting. The crater, it is true, widened out into a cavern sufficiently\r\nlarge, but here its accommodation ended. Above and below were a few\r\nledges in the rock that would serve as receptacles for provisions; but,\r\nwith the exception of a small recess that must be reserved for Nina,\r\nit was clear that henceforth they must all renounce the idea of\r\nhaving separate apartments. The single cave must be their dining-room,\r\ndrawing-room, and dormitory, all in one. From living the life of rabbits\r\nin a warren, they were reduced to the existence of moles, with the\r\ndifference that they could not, like them, forget their troubles in a\r\nlong winter’s sleep.\r\n\r\nThe cavern, however, was quite capable of being lighted by means of\r\nlamps and lanterns. Among the stores were several barrels of oil and\r\na considerable quantity of spirits of wine, which might be burned when\r\nrequired for cooking purposes. Moreover, it would be unnecessary for\r\nthem to confine themselves entirely to the seclusion of their gloomy\r\nresidence; well wrapped up, there would be nothing to prevent them\r\nmaking occasional excursions both to the Hive and to the sea-shore. A\r\nsupply of fresh water would be constantly required; ice for this purpose\r\nmust be perpetually carried in from the coast, and it would be necessary\r\nto arrange that everyone in turn should perform this office, as it would\r\nbe no sinecure to clamber up the sides of the crater for 900 feet, and\r\ndescend the same distance with a heavy burden.\r\n\r\nBut the emergency was great, and it was accordingly soon decided that\r\nthe little colony should forthwith take up its quarters in the cave.\r\nAfter all, they said, they should hardly be much worse off than\r\nthousands who annually winter in Arctic regions. On board the\r\nwhaling-vessels, and in the establishments of the Hudson’s Bay Company,\r\nsuch luxuries as separate cabins or sleeping-chambers are never thought\r\nof; one large apartment, well heated and ventilated, with as few corners\r\nas possible, is considered far more healthy; and on board ship the\r\nentire hold, and in forts a single floor, is appropriated to this\r\npurpose. The recollection of this fact served to reconcile them, in a\r\ngreat degree, to the change to which they felt it requisite to submit.\r\n\r\nHaving remounted the ascent, they made the result of their exploration\r\nknown to the mass of the community, who received the tidings with a\r\nsense of relief, and cordially accepted the scheme of the migration.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to clear the cavern of its accumulation of ashes,\r\nand then the labor of removal commenced in earnest. Never was a task\r\nundertaken with greater zest. The fear of being to a certainty frozen\r\nto death if they remained where they were, was a stimulus that\r\nmade everyone put forth all his energies. Beds, furniture, cooking\r\nutensils--first the stores of the _Dobryna_, then the cargo of the\r\ntartan--all were carried down with the greatest alacrity, and the\r\ndiminished weight combined with the downhill route to make the labor\r\nproceed with incredible briskness.\r\n\r\nAlthough Professor Rosette yielded to the pressure of circumstances,\r\nand allowed himself to be conducted to the lower regions, nothing would\r\ninduce him to allow his telescope to be carried underground; and as it\r\nwas undeniable that it would certainly be of no service deep down in the\r\nbowels of the mountain, it was allowed to remain undisturbed upon its\r\ntripod in the great hall of Nina’s Hive.\r\n\r\nAs for Isaac Hakkabut, his outcry was beyond description lamentable.\r\nNever, in the whole universe, had a merchant met with such reverses;\r\nnever had such a pitiable series of losses befallen an unfortunate man.\r\nRegardless of the ridicule which his abject wretchedness excited, he\r\nhowled on still, and kept up an unending wail; but meanwhile he kept\r\na keen eye upon every article of his property, and amidst universal\r\nlaughter insisted on having every item registered in an inventory as it\r\nwas transferred to its appointed place of safety. Servadac considerately\r\nallowed the whole of the cargo to be deposited in a hollow apart by\r\nitself, over which the Jew was permitted to keep a watch as vigilant as\r\nhe pleased.\r\n\r\nBy the 10th the removal was accomplished. Rescued, at all events, from\r\nthe exposure to a perilous temperature of 60 degrees below zero, the\r\ncommunity was installed in its new home. The large cave was lighted by\r\nthe _Dobryna’s_ lamps, while several lanterns, suspended at intervals\r\nalong the acclivity that led to their deserted quarters above, gave\r\na weird picturesqueness to the scene, that might vie with any of the\r\ngraphic descriptions of the “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments.”\r\n\r\n“How do you like this, Nina?” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“_Va bene!_” replied the child. “We are only living in the cellars\r\ninstead of upon the ground floor.”\r\n\r\n“We will try and make ourselves comfortable,” said the orderly.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, we will be happy here,” rejoined the child; “it is nice and\r\nwarm.”\r\n\r\nAlthough they were as careful as they could to conceal their misgivings\r\nfrom the rest, Servadac and his two friends could not regard their\r\npresent situation without distrust. When alone, they would frequently\r\nask each other what would become of them all, if the volcanic heat\r\nshould really be subsiding, or if some unexpected perturbation should\r\nretard the course of the comet, and compel them to an indefinitely\r\nprolonged residence in their grim abode. It was scarcely likely that the\r\ncomet could supply the fuel of which ere long they would be in urgent\r\nneed. Who could expect to find coal in the bowels of Gallia,--coal,\r\nwhich is the residuum of ancient forests mineralized by the lapse of\r\nages? Would not the lava-cinders exhumed from the extinct volcano be\r\ntheir last poor resource?\r\n\r\n“Keep up your spirits, my friends,” said Servadac; “we have plenty of\r\ntime before us at present. Let us hope that as fresh difficulties arise,\r\nfresh ways of escape will open. Never despair!”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the count; “it is an old saying that ‘Necessity is the\r\nmother of invention.’ Besides, I should think it very unlikely that the\r\ninternal heat will fail us now before the summer.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant declared that he entertained the same hope. As the reason\r\nof his opinion he alleged that the combustion of the eruptive matter\r\nwas most probably of quite recent origin, because the comet before\r\nits collision with the earth had possessed no atmosphere, and that\r\nconsequently no oxygen could have penetrated to its interior.\r\n\r\n“Most likely you are right,” replied the count; “and so far from\r\ndreading a failure of the internal heat, I am not quite sure that we may\r\nnot be exposed to a more terrible calamity still?”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Servadac.\r\n\r\n“The calamity of the eruption breaking out suddenly again, and taking us\r\nby surprise.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens!” cried the captain, “we will not think of that.”\r\n\r\n“The outbreak may happen again,” said the lieutenant, calmly; “but\r\nit will be our fault, our own lack of vigilance, if we are taken by\r\nsurprise.” And so the conversation dropped.\r\n\r\nThe 15th of January dawned; and the comet was 220,000,000 leagues from\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nGallia had reached its aphelion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. DREARY MONTHS\r\n\r\n\r\nHenceforth, then, with a velocity ever increasing, Gallia would\r\nre-approach the sun.\r\n\r\nExcept the thirteen Englishmen who had been left at Gibraltar, every\r\nliving creature had taken refuge in the dark abyss of the volcano’s\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\nAnd with those Englishmen, how had it fared?\r\n\r\n“Far better than with ourselves,” was the sentiment that would have\r\nbeen universally accepted in Nina’s Hive. And there was every reason\r\nto conjecture that so it was. The party at Gibraltar, they all agreed,\r\nwould not, like themselves, have been compelled to have recourse to\r\na stream of lava for their supply of heat; they, no doubt, had had\r\nabundance of fuel as well as food; and in their solid casemate, with its\r\nsubstantial walls, they would find ample shelter from the rigor of the\r\ncold. The time would have been passed at least in comfort, and perhaps\r\nin contentment; and Colonel Murphy and Major Oliphant would have had\r\nleisure more than sufficient for solving the most abstruse problems of\r\nthe chess-board. All of them, too, would be happy in the confidence that\r\nwhen the time should come, England would have full meed of praise to\r\naward to the gallant soldiers who had adhered so well and so manfully to\r\ntheir post.\r\n\r\nIt did, indeed, more than once occur to the minds both of Servadac\r\nand his friends that, if their condition should become one of extreme\r\nemergency, they might, as a last resource, betake themselves to\r\nGibraltar, and there seek a refuge; but their former reception had\r\nnot been of the kindest, and they were little disposed to renew an\r\nacquaintanceship that was marked by so little cordiality. Not in the\r\nleast that they would expect to meet with any inhospitable rebuff. Far\r\nfrom that; they knew well enough that Englishmen, whatever their faults,\r\nwould be the last to abandon their fellow-creatures in the hour of\r\ndistress. Nevertheless, except the necessity became far more urgent than\r\nit had hitherto proved, they resolved to endeavor to remain in their\r\npresent quarters. Up till this time no casualties had diminished\r\ntheir original number, but to undertake so long a journey across that\r\nunsheltered expanse of ice could scarcely fail to result in the loss of\r\nsome of their party.\r\n\r\nHowever great was the desire to find a retreat for every living thing\r\nin the deep hollow of the crater, it was found necessary to slaughter\r\nalmost all the domestic animals before the removal of the community from\r\nNina’s Hive. To have stabled them all in the cavern below would have\r\nbeen quite impossible, whilst to have left them in the upper galleries\r\nwould only have been to abandon them to a cruel death; and since meat\r\ncould be preserved for an indefinite time in the original store-places,\r\nnow colder than ever, the expedient of killing the animals seemed to\r\nrecommend itself as equally prudent and humane.\r\n\r\nNaturally the captain and Ben Zoof were most anxious that their favorite\r\nhorses should be saved, and accordingly, by dint of the greatest care,\r\nall difficulties in the way were overcome, and Zephyr and Galette were\r\nconducted down the crater, where they were installed in a large hole and\r\nprovided with forage, which was still abundant.\r\n\r\nBirds, subsisting only on scraps thrown out to them did not cease to\r\nfollow the population in its migration, and so numerous did they become\r\nthat multitudes of them had repeatedly to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe general re-arrangement of the new residence was no easy business,\r\nand occupied so much time that the end of January arrived before they\r\ncould be said to be fairly settled. And then began a life of dreary\r\nmonotony. Then seemed to creep over everyone a kind of moral torpor\r\nas well as physical lassitude, which Servadac, the count, and the\r\nlieutenant did their best not only to combat in themselves, but\r\nto counteract in the general community. They provided a variety of\r\nintellectual pursuits; they instituted debates in which everybody was\r\nencouraged to take part; they read aloud, and explained extracts from\r\nthe elementary manuals of science, or from the books of adventurous\r\ntravel which their library supplied; and Russians and Spaniards, day\r\nafter day, might be seen gathered round the large table, giving their\r\nbest attention to instruction which should send them back to Mother\r\nEarth less ignorant than they had left her.\r\n\r\nSelfish and morose, Hakkabut could never be induced to be present\r\nat these social gatherings. He was far too much occupied in his own\r\nappropriated corner, either in conning his accounts, or in counting his\r\nmoney. Altogether, with what he had before, he now possessed the round\r\nsum of 150,000 francs, half of which was in sterling gold; but nothing\r\ncould give him any satisfaction while he knew that the days were\r\npassing, and that he was denied the opportunity of putting out his\r\ncapital in advantageous investments, or securing a proper interest.\r\n\r\nNeither did Palmyrin Rosette find leisure to take any share in the\r\nmutual intercourse. His occupation was far too absorbing for him to\r\nsuffer it to be interrupted, and to him, living as he did perpetually in\r\na world of figures, the winter days seemed neither long nor wearisome.\r\nHaving ascertained every possible particular about his comet, he was now\r\ndevoting himself with equal ardor to the analysis of all the properties\r\nof the satellite Nerina, to which he appeared to assert the same claim\r\nof proprietorship.\r\n\r\nIn order to investigate Nerina it was indispensable that he should make\r\nseveral actual observations at various points of the orbit; and for this\r\npurpose he repeatedly made his way up to the grotto above, where, in\r\nspite of the extreme severity of the cold, he would persevere in the use\r\nof his telescope till he was all but paralyzed. But what he felt more\r\nthan anything was the want of some retired apartment, where he could\r\npursue his studies without hindrance or intrusion.\r\n\r\nIt was about the beginning of February, when the professor brought his\r\ncomplaint to Captain Servadac, and begged him to assign him a chamber,\r\nno matter how small, in which he should be free to carry on his task in\r\nsilence and without molestation. So readily did Servadac promise to do\r\neverything in his power to provide him with the accommodation for which\r\nhe asked, that the professor was put into such a manifest good temper\r\nthat the captain ventured to speak upon the matter that was ever\r\nuppermost in his mind.\r\n\r\n“I do not mean,” he began timidly, “to cast the least imputation of\r\ninaccuracy upon any of your calculations, but would you allow me, my\r\ndear professor, to suggest that you should revise your estimate of the\r\nduration of Gallia’s period of revolution. It is so important, you know,\r\nso all important; the difference of one half minute, you know, would so\r\ncertainly mar the expectation of reunion with the earth--”\r\n\r\nAnd seeing a cloud gathering on Rosette’s face, he added:\r\n\r\n“I am sure Lieutenant Procope would be only too happy to render you any\r\nassistance in the revision.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the professor, bridling up, “I want no assistant; my\r\ncalculations want no revision. I never make an error. I have made my\r\nreckoning as far as Gallia is concerned. I am now making a like estimate\r\nof the elements of Nerina.”\r\n\r\nConscious how impolitic it would be to press this matter further, the\r\ncaptain casually remarked that he should have supposed that all the\r\nelements of Nerina had been calculated long since by astronomers on the\r\nearth. It was about as unlucky a speech as he could possibly have made.\r\nThe professor glared at him fiercely.\r\n\r\n“Astounding, sir!” he exclaimed. “Yes! Nerina was a planet then;\r\neverything that appertained to the planet was determined; but Nerina is\r\na moon now. And do you not think, sir, that we have a right to know as\r\nmuch about our moon as those _terrestrials_”--and he curled his lip as\r\nhe spoke with a contemptuous emphasis--“know of theirs?”\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon,” said the corrected captain.\r\n\r\n“Well then, never mind,” replied the professor, quickly appeased; “only\r\nwill you have the goodness to get me a proper place for study?”\r\n\r\n“I will, as I promised, do all I can,” answered Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said the professor. “No immediate hurry; an hour hence will\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this condescension on the part of the man of science,\r\nsome hours had to elapse before any place of retreat could be discovered\r\nlikely to suit his requirements; but at length a little nook was found\r\nin the side of the cavern just large enough to hold an armchair and\r\na table, and in this the astronomer was soon ensconced to his entire\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nBuried thus, nearly 900 feet below ground, the Gallians ought to have\r\nhad unbounded mental energy to furnish an adequate reaction to the\r\ndepressing monotony of their existence; but many days would often elapse\r\nwithout any one of them ascending to the surface of the soil, and had\r\nit not been for the necessity of obtaining fresh water, it seemed almost\r\nprobable that there would never have been an effort made to leave the\r\ncavern at all.\r\n\r\nA few excursions, it is true, were made in the downward direction. The\r\nthree leaders, with Ben Zoof, made their way to the lower depths of the\r\ncrater, not with the design of making any further examination as to\r\nthe nature of the rock--for although it might be true enough that it\r\ncontained thirty per cent. of gold, it was as valueless to them as\r\ngranite--but with the intention of ascertaining whether the subterranean\r\nfire still retained its activity. Satisfied upon this point, they came\r\nto the conclusion that the eruption which had so suddenly ceased in one\r\nspot had certainly broken out in another.\r\n\r\nFebruary, March, April, May, passed wearily by; but day succeeded to day\r\nwith such gloomy sameness that it was little wonder that no notice was\r\ntaken of the lapse of time. The people seemed rather to vegetate than\r\nto live, and their want of vigor became at times almost alarming. The\r\nreadings around the long table ceased to be attractive, and the debates,\r\nsustained by few, became utterly wanting in animation. The Spaniards\r\ncould hardly be roused to quit their beds, and seemed to have scarcely\r\nenergy enough to eat. The Russians, constitutionally of more enduring\r\ntemperament, did not give way to the same extent, but the long and drear\r\nconfinement was beginning to tell upon them all. Servadac, the count,\r\nand the lieutenant all knew well enough that it was the want of air and\r\nexercise that was the cause of much of this mental depression; but\r\nwhat could they do? The most serious remonstrances on their part were\r\nentirely in vain. In fact, they themselves occasionally fell a prey\r\nto the same lassitude both of body and mind. Long fits of drowsiness,\r\ncombined with an utter aversion to food, would come over them. It almost\r\nseemed as if their entire nature had become degenerate, and that, like\r\ntortoises, they could sleep and fast till the return of summer.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, little Nina bore her hardships more bravely than any\r\nof them. Flitting about, coaxing one to eat, another to drink, rousing\r\nPablo as often as he seemed yielding to the common languor, the child\r\nbecame the life of the party. Her merry prattle enlivened the gloom of\r\nthe grim cavern like the sweet notes of a bird; her gay Italian songs\r\nbroke the monotony of the depressing silence; and almost unconscious as\r\nthe half-dormant population of Gallia were of her influence, they still\r\nwould have missed her bright presence sorely. The months still glided\r\non; how, it seemed impossible for the inhabitants of the living tomb to\r\nsay. There was a dead level of dullness.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of June the general torpor appeared slightly to relax\r\nits hold upon its victims. This partial revival was probably due to the\r\nsomewhat increased influence of the sun, still far, far away. During\r\nthe first half of the Gallian year, Lieutenant Procope had taken careful\r\nnote of Rosette’s monthly announcements of the comet’s progress, and he\r\nwas able now, without reference to the professor, to calculate the rate\r\nof advance on its way back towards the sun. He found that Gallia had\r\nre-crossed the orbit of Jupiter, but was still at the enormous distance\r\nof 197,000,000 leagues from the sun, and he reckoned that in about four\r\nmonths it would have entered the zone of the telescopic planets.\r\n\r\nGradually, but uninterruptedly, life and spirits continued to revive,\r\nand by the end of the month Servadac and his little colony had regained\r\nmost of their ordinary physical and mental energies. Ben Zoof, in\r\nparticular, roused himself with redoubled vigor, like a giant refreshed\r\nfrom his slumbers. The visits, consequently, to the long-neglected\r\ngalleries of Nina’s Hive became more and more frequent.\r\n\r\nOne day an excursion was made to the shore. It was still bitterly cold,\r\nbut the atmosphere had lost nothing of its former stillness, and not a\r\ncloud was visible from horizon to zenith. The old footmarks were all as\r\ndistinct as on the day in which they had been imprinted, and the only\r\nportion of the shore where any change was apparent was in the little\r\ncreek. Here the elevation of the ice had gone on increasing, until the\r\nschooner and the tartan had been uplifted to a height of 150 feet, not\r\nonly rendering them quite inaccessible, but exposing them to all but\r\ncertain destruction in the event of a thaw.\r\n\r\nIsaac Hakkabut, immovable from the personal oversight of his property\r\nin the cavern, had not accompanied the party, and consequently was in\r\nblissful ignorance of the fate that threatened his vessel. “A good thing\r\nthe old fellow wasn’t there to see,” observed Ben Zoof; “he would have\r\nscreamed like a peacock. What a misfortune it is,” he added, speaking to\r\nhimself, “to have a peacock’s voice, without its plumage!”\r\n\r\nDuring the months of July and August, Gallia advanced 164,000,000\r\nleagues along her orbit. At night the cold was still intense, but in\r\nthe daytime the sun, here full upon the equator, caused an appreciable\r\ndifference of 20 degrees in the temperature. Like birds, the population\r\nspent whole days exposed to its grateful warmth, rarely returning till\r\nnightfall to the shade of their gloomy home.\r\n\r\nThis spring-time, if such it may be called, had a most enlivening\r\ninfluence upon all. Hope and courage revived as day by day the sun’s\r\ndisc expanded in the heavens, and every evening the earth assumed a\r\ngreater magnitude amongst the fixed stars. It was distant yet, but the\r\ngoal was cheeringly in view.\r\n\r\n“I can’t believe that yonder little speck of light contains my mountain\r\nof Montmartre,” said Ben Zoof, one night, after he had been gazing long\r\nand steadily at the far-off world.\r\n\r\n“You will, I hope, some day find out that it does,” answered his master.\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said the orderly, without moving his eye from the distant\r\nsphere. After meditating a while, he spoke again. “I suppose Professor\r\nRosette couldn’t make his comet go straight back, could he?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” cried Servadac.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof understood the correction.\r\n\r\n“No,” continued the captain; “it is not for man to disturb the order of\r\nthe universe. That belongs to a Higher Power than ours!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. THE PROFESSOR PERPLEXED\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother month passed away, and it was now September, but it was still\r\nimpossible to leave the warmth of the subterranean retreat for the\r\nmore airy and commodious quarters of the Hive, where “the bees” would\r\ncertainly have been frozen to death in their cells. It was altogether\r\nquite as much a matter of congratulation as of regret that the volcano\r\nshowed no symptoms of resuming its activity; for although a return of\r\nthe eruption might have rendered their former resort again habitable,\r\nany sudden outbreak would have been disastrous to them where they were,\r\nthe crater being the sole outlet by which the burning lava could escape.\r\n\r\n“A wretched time we have had for the last seven months,” said the\r\norderly one day to his master; “but what a comfort little Nina has been\r\nto us all!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” replied Servadac; “she is a charming little creature. I\r\nhardly know how we should have got on without her.”\r\n\r\n“What is to become of her when we arrive back at the earth?”\r\n\r\n“Not much fear, Ben Zoof, but that she will be well taken care of.\r\nPerhaps you and I had better adopt her.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, yes,” assented the orderly. “You can be her father, and I can be\r\nher mother.”\r\n\r\nServadac laughed. “Then you and I shall be man and wife.”\r\n\r\n“We have been as good as that for a long time,” observed Ben Zoof,\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of October, the temperature had so far moderated that\r\nit could scarcely be said to be intolerable. The comet’s distance was\r\nscarcely three times as great from the sun as the earth from the sun, so\r\nthat the thermometer rarely sunk beyond 35 degrees below zero. The whole\r\nparty began to make almost daily visits to the Hive, and frequently\r\nproceeded to the shore, where they resumed their skating exercise,\r\nrejoicing in their recovered freedom like prisoners liberated from a\r\ndungeon. Whilst the rest were enjoying their recreation, Servadac and\r\nthe count would hold long conversations with Lieutenant Procope about\r\ntheir present position and future prospects, discussing all manner of\r\nspeculations as to the results of the anticipated collision with\r\nthe earth, and wondering whether any measures could be devised for\r\nmitigating the violence of a shock which might be terrible in its\r\nconsequences, even if it did not entail a total annihilation of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere was no visitor to the Hive more regular than Rosette. He\r\nhad already directed his telescope to be moved back to his former\r\nobservatory, where, as much as the cold would permit him, he persisted\r\nin making his all-absorbing studies of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe result of these studies no one ventured to inquire; but it became\r\ngenerally noticed that something was very seriously disturbing\r\nthe professor’s equanimity. Not only would he be seen toiling more\r\nfrequently up the arduous way that lay between his nook below and his\r\ntelescope above, but he would be heard muttering in an angry tone that\r\nindicated considerable agitation.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he was hurrying down to his study, he met Ben Zoof, who,\r\nsecretly entertaining a feeling of delight at the professor’s manifest\r\ndiscomfiture, made some casual remark about things not being very\r\nstraight. The way in which his advance was received the good orderly\r\nnever divulged, but henceforward he maintained the firm conviction that\r\nthere was something very much amiss up in the sky.\r\n\r\nTo Servadac and his friends this continual disquietude and ill-humor on\r\nthe part of the professor occasioned no little anxiety. From what, they\r\nasked, could his dissatisfaction arise? They could only conjecture that\r\nhe had discovered some flaw in his reckonings; and if this were so,\r\nmight there not be reason to apprehend that their anticipations of\r\ncoming into contact with the earth, at the settled time, might all be\r\nfalsified?\r\n\r\nDay followed day, and still there was no cessation of the professor’s\r\ndiscomposure. He was the most miserable of mortals. If really his\r\ncalculations and his observations were at variance, this, in a man of\r\nhis irritable temperament, would account for his perpetual perturbation.\r\nBut he entered into no explanation; he only climbed up to his telescope,\r\nlooking haggard and distressed, and when compelled by the frost to\r\nretire, he would make his way back to his study more furious than ever.\r\nAt times he was heard giving vent to his vexation. “Confound it! what\r\ndoes it mean? what is she doing? All behind! Is Newton a fool? Is the\r\nlaw of universal gravitation the law of universal nonsense?” And the\r\nlittle man would seize his head in both his hands, and tear away at the\r\nscanty locks which he could ill afford to lose.\r\n\r\nEnough was overheard to confirm the suspicion that there was some\r\nirreconcilable discrepancy between the results of his computation and\r\nwhat he had actually observed; and yet, if he had been called upon to\r\nsay, he would have sooner insisted that there was derangement in\r\nthe laws of celestial mechanism, than have owned there was the least\r\nprobability of error in any of his own calculations. Assuredly, if the\r\npoor professor had had any flesh to lose he would have withered away to\r\na shadow.\r\n\r\nBut this state of things was before long to come to an end. On the 12th,\r\nBen Zoof, who was hanging about outside the great hall of the cavern,\r\nheard the professor inside utter a loud cry. Hurrying in to ascertain\r\nthe cause, he found Rosette in a state of perfect frenzy, in which\r\necstasy and rage seemed to be struggling for the predominance.\r\n\r\n“Eureka! Eureka!” yelled the excited astronomer.\r\n\r\n“What, in the name of peace, do you mean?” bawled Ben Zoof, in\r\nopen-mouthed amazement.\r\n\r\n“Eureka!” again shrieked the little man.\r\n\r\n“How? What? Where?” roared the bewildered orderly.\r\n\r\n“Eureka! I say,” repeated Rosette; “and if you don’t understand me, you\r\nmay go to the devil!”\r\n\r\nWithout availing himself of this polite invitation, Ben Zoof betook\r\nhimself to his master. “Something has happened to the professor,”\r\n he said; “he is rushing about like a madman, screeching and yelling\r\n‘Eureka!’”\r\n\r\n“Eureka?” exclaimed Servadac. “That means he has made a discovery;” and,\r\nfull of anxiety, he hurried off to meet the professor.\r\n\r\nBut, however great was his desire to ascertain what this discovery\r\nimplied, his curiosity was not yet destined to be gratified. The\r\nprofessor kept muttering in incoherent phrases: “Rascal! he shall pay\r\nfor it yet. I will be even with him! Cheat! Thrown me out!” But he did\r\nnot vouchsafe any reply to Servadac’s inquiries, and withdrew to his\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nFrom that day Rosette, for some reason at present incomprehensible,\r\nquite altered his behavior to Isaac Hakkabut, a man for whom he had\r\nalways hitherto evinced the greatest repugnance and contempt. All at\r\nonce he began to show a remarkable interest in the Jew and his affairs,\r\npaying several visits to the dark little storehouse, making inquiries as\r\nto the state of business and expressing some solicitude about the state\r\nof the exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe wily Jew was taken somewhat by surprise, but came to an immediate\r\nconclusion that the professor was contemplating borrowing some money; he\r\nwas consequently very cautious in all his replies.\r\n\r\nIt was not Hakkabut’s habit ever to advance a loan except at an\r\nextravagant rate of interest, or without demanding far more than an\r\nadequate security. Count Timascheff, a Russian nobleman, was evidently\r\nrich; to him perhaps, for a proper consideration, a loan might be made:\r\nCaptain Servadac was a Gascon, and Gascons are proverbially poor; it\r\nwould never do to lend any money to him; but here was a professor,\r\na mere man of science, with circumscribed means; did _he_ expect to\r\nborrow? Certainly Isaac would as soon think of flying, as of lending\r\nmoney to him. Such were the thoughts that made him receive all Rosette’s\r\napproaches with a careful reservation.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before Hakkabut was to be called upon to apply\r\nhis money to a purpose for which he had not reckoned. In his eagerness\r\nto effect sales, he had parted with all the alimentary articles in his\r\ncargo without having the precautionary prudence to reserve enough for\r\nhis own consumption. Amongst other things that failed him was his stock\r\nof coffee, and as coffee was a beverage without which he deemed it\r\nimpossible to exist, he found himself in considerable perplexity.\r\n\r\nHe pondered the matter over for a long time, and ultimately persuaded\r\nhimself that, after all, the stores were the common property of all,\r\nand that he had as much right to a share as anyone else. Accordingly, he\r\nmade his way to Ben Zoof, and, in the most amiable tone he could assume,\r\nbegged as a favor that he would let him have a pound of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe orderly shook his head dubiously.\r\n\r\n“A pound of coffee, old Nathan? I can’t say.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? You have some?” said Isaac.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes! plenty--a hundred kilogrammes.”\r\n\r\n“Then let me have one pound. I shall be grateful.”\r\n\r\n“Hang your gratitude!”\r\n\r\n“Only one pound! You would not refuse anybody else.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just the very point, old Samuel; if you were anybody else,\r\nI should know very well what to do. I must refer the matter to his\r\nExcellency.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, his Excellency will do me justice.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you will find his justice rather too much for you.” And with\r\nthis consoling remark, the orderly went to seek his master.\r\n\r\nRosette meanwhile had been listening to the conversation, and secretly\r\nrejoicing that an opportunity for which he had been watching had\r\narrived. “What’s the matter, Master Isaac? Have you parted with all your\r\ncoffee?” he asked, in a sympathizing voice, when Ben Zoof was gone.\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes, indeed,” groaned Hakkabut, “and now I require some for my own\r\nuse. In my little black hole I cannot live without my coffee.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you cannot,” agreed the professor.\r\n\r\n“And don’t you think the governor ought to let me have it?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I must have coffee,” said the Jew again.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” the professor assented. “Coffee is nutritious; it warms the\r\nblood. How much do you want?”\r\n\r\n“A pound. A pound will last me for a long time.”\r\n\r\n“And who will weigh it for you?” asked Rosette, scarcely able to conceal\r\nthe eagerness that prompted the question.\r\n\r\n“Why, they will weigh it with my steelyard, of course. There is no other\r\nbalance here.” And as the Jew spoke, the professor fancied he could\r\ndetect the faintest of sighs.\r\n\r\n“Good, Master Isaac; all the better for you! You will get your seven\r\npounds instead of one!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; well, seven, or thereabouts--thereabouts,” stammered the Jew with\r\nconsiderable hesitation.\r\n\r\nRosette scanned his countenance narrowly, and was about to probe him\r\nwith further questions, when Ben Zoof returned. “And what does his\r\nExcellency say?” inquired Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“Why, Nehemiah, he says he shan’t give you any.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful heavens!” began the Jew.\r\n\r\n“He says he doesn’t mind selling you a little.”\r\n\r\n“But, by the holy city, why does he make me pay for what anybody else\r\ncould have for nothing?”\r\n\r\n“As I told you before, you are not anybody else; so, come along. You\r\ncan afford to buy what you want. We should like to see the color of your\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful heavens!” the old man whined once more.\r\n\r\n“Now, none of that! Yes or no? If you are going to buy, say so at once;\r\nif not, I shall shut up shop.”\r\n\r\nHakkabut knew well enough that the orderly was not a man to be trifled\r\nwith, and said, in a tremulous voice, “Yes, I will buy.”\r\n\r\nThe professor, who had been looking on with much interest, betrayed\r\nmanifest symptoms of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“How much do you want? What will you charge for it?” asked Isaac,\r\nmournfully, putting his hand into his pocket and chinking his money.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we will deal gently with you. We will not make any profit. You\r\nshall have it for the same price that we paid for it. Ten francs a\r\npound, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe Jew hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Come now, what is the use of your hesitating? Your gold will have no\r\nvalue when you go back to the world.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Hakkabut, startled.\r\n\r\n“You will find out some day,” answered Ben Zoof, significantly.\r\n\r\nHakkabut drew out a small piece of gold from his pocket, took it close\r\nunder the lamp, rolled it over in his hand, and pressed it to his\r\nlips. “Shall you weigh me the coffee with my steelyard?” he asked, in a\r\nquavering voice that confirmed the professor’s suspicions.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing else to weigh it with; you know that well enough, old\r\nShechem,” said Ben Zoof. The steelyard was then produced; a tray was\r\nsuspended to the hook, and upon this coffee was thrown until the needle\r\nregistered the weight of one pound. Of course, it took seven pounds of\r\ncoffee to do this.\r\n\r\n“There you are! There’s your coffee, man!” Ben Zoof said.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?” inquired Hakkabut, peering down close to the dial. “Are\r\nyou quite sure that the needle touches the point?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; look and see.”\r\n\r\n“Give it a little push, please.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because--because--”\r\n\r\n“Well, because of what?” cried the orderly, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Because I think, perhaps--I am not quite sure--perhaps the steelyard is\r\nnot quite correct.”\r\n\r\nThe words were not uttered before the professor, fierce as a tiger, had\r\nrushed at the Jew, had seized him by the throat, and was shaking him\r\ntill he was black in the face.\r\n\r\n“Help! help!” screamed Hakkabut. “I shall be strangled.”\r\n\r\n“Rascal! consummate rascal! thief! villain!” the professor reiterated,\r\nand continued to shake the Jew furiously.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof looked on and laughed, making no attempt to interfere; he had\r\nno sympathy with either of the two.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the scuffling, however, drew the attention of Servadac,\r\nwho, followed by his companions, hastened to the scene. The combatants\r\nwere soon parted. “What is the meaning of all this?” demanded the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the professor had recovered his breath, exhausted by his\r\nexertions, he said, “The old reprobate, the rascal has cheated us! His\r\nsteelyard is wrong! He is a thief!”\r\n\r\nCaptain Servadac looked sternly at Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“How is this, Hakkabut? Is this a fact?”\r\n\r\n“No, no--yes--no, your Excellency, only--”\r\n\r\n“He is a cheat, a thief!” roared the excited astronomer. “His weights\r\ndeceive!”\r\n\r\n“Stop, stop!” interposed Servadac; “let us hear. Tell me, Hakkabut--”\r\n\r\n“The steelyard lies! It cheats! it lies!” roared the irrepressible\r\nRosette.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Hakkabut, I say,” repeated Servadac.\r\n\r\nThe Jew only kept on stammering, “Yes--no--I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nBut heedless of any interruption, the professor continued, “False\r\nweights! That confounded steelyard! It gave a false result! The mass was\r\nwrong! The observations contradicted the calculations; they were wrong!\r\nShe was out of place! Yes, out of place entirely.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Servadac and Procope in a breath, “out of place?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, completely,” said the professor.\r\n\r\n“Gallia out of place?” repeated Servadac, agitated with alarm.\r\n\r\n“I did not say Gallia,” replied Rosette, stamping his foot impetuously;\r\n“I said Nerina.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Nerina,” answered Servadac. “But what of Gallia?” he inquired,\r\nstill nervously.\r\n\r\n“Gallia, of course, is on her way to the earth. I told you so. But that\r\nJew is a rascal!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. A JOURNEY AND A DISAPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was as the professor had said. From the day that Isaac Hakkabut had\r\nentered upon his mercantile career, his dealings had all been carried\r\non by a system of false weight. That deceitful steelyard had been the\r\nmainspring of his fortune. But when it had become his lot to be the\r\npurchaser instead of the vendor, his spirit had groaned within him at\r\nbeing compelled to reap the fruits of his own dishonesty. No one who had\r\nstudied his character could be much surprised at the confession that was\r\nextorted from him, that for every supposed kilogramme that he had ever\r\nsold the true weight was only 750 grammes, or just five and twenty per\r\ncent. less than it ought to have been.\r\n\r\nThe professor, however, had ascertained all that he wanted to know. By\r\nestimating his comet at a third as much again as its proper weight,\r\nhe had found that his calculations were always at variance with the\r\nobserved situation of the satellite, which was immediately influenced by\r\nthe mass of its primary.\r\n\r\nBut now, besides enjoying the satisfaction of having punished old\r\nHakkabut, Rosette was able to recommence his calculations with reference\r\nto the elements of Nerina upon a correct basis, a task to which he\r\ndevoted himself with redoubled energy.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily imagined that Isaac Hakkabut, thus caught in his own\r\ntrap, was jeered most unmercifully by those whom he had attempted to\r\nmake his dupes. Ben Zoof, in particular, was never wearied of telling\r\nhim how on his return to the world he would be prosecuted for using\r\nfalse weights, and would certainly become acquainted with the inside\r\nof a prison. Thus badgered, he secluded himself more than ever in his\r\ndismal hole, never venturing, except when absolutely obliged, to face\r\nthe other members of the community.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of October the comet re-entered the zone of the telescopic\r\nplanets, one of which had been captured as a satellite, and the origin\r\nof the whole of which is most probably correctly attributed to the\r\ndisintegration of some large planet that formerly revolved between the\r\norbits of Mars and Jupiter. By the beginning of the following month half\r\nof this zone had been traversed, and only two months remained before\r\nthe collision with the earth was to be expected. The temperature was now\r\nrarely below 12 degrees below zero, but that was far too cold to permit\r\nthe slightest symptoms of a thaw. The surface of the sea remained as\r\nfrozen as ever, and the two vessels, high up on their icy pedestals,\r\nremained unaltered in their critical position.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the question began to be mooted whether it\r\nwould not be right to reopen some communication with the Englishmen at\r\nGibraltar. Not that any doubt was entertained as to their having been\r\nable successfully to cope with the rigors of the winter; but Captain\r\nServadac, in a way that did honor to his generosity, represented that,\r\nhowever uncourteous might have been their former behavior, it was at\r\nleast due to them that they should be informed of the true condition of\r\nthings, which they had had no opportunity of learning; and, moreover,\r\nthat they should be invited to co-operate with the population of Nina’s\r\nHive, in the event of any measures being suggested by which the shock of\r\nthe approaching collision could be mitigated.\r\n\r\nThe count and the lieutenant both heartily concurred in Servadac’s\r\nsentiments of humanity and prudence, and all agreed that if the\r\nintercourse were to be opened at all, no time could be so suitable as\r\nthe present, while the surface of the sea presented a smooth and solid\r\nfooting. After a thaw should set in, neither the yacht nor the tartan\r\ncould be reckoned on for service, and it would be inexpedient to make\r\nuse of the steam launch, for which only a few tons of coal had been\r\nreserved, just sufficient to convey them to Gourbi Island when the\r\noccasion should arise; whilst as to the yawl, which, transformed into a\r\nsledge, had performed so successful a trip to Formentera, the absence of\r\nwind would make that quite unavailable. It was true that with the return\r\nof summer temperature, there would be certain to be a derangement in the\r\natmosphere of Gallia, which would result in wind, but for the present\r\nthe air was altogether too still for the yawl to have any prospects of\r\nmaking its way to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe only question remaining was as to the possibility of going on foot.\r\nThe distance was somewhere about 240 miles. Captain Servadac declared\r\nhimself quite equal to the undertaking. To skate sixty or seventy miles\r\na day would be nothing, he said, to a practical skater like himself. The\r\nwhole journey there and back might be performed in eight days. Provided\r\nwith a compass, a sufficient supply of cold meat, and a spirit lamp, by\r\nwhich he might boil his coffee, he was perfectly sure he should, without\r\nthe least difficulty, accomplish an enterprise that chimed in so exactly\r\nwith his adventurous spirit.\r\n\r\nEqually urgent were both the count and the lieutenant to be allowed\r\nto accompany him; nay, they even offered to go instead; but Servadac,\r\nexpressing himself as most grateful for their consideration, declined\r\ntheir offer, and avowed his resolution of taking no other companion than\r\nhis own orderly.\r\n\r\nHighly delighted at his master’s decision, Ben Zoof expressed his\r\nsatisfaction at the prospect of “stretching his legs a bit,” declaring\r\nthat nothing could induce him to permit the captain to go alone. There\r\nwas no delay. The departure was fixed for the following morning, the 2nd\r\nof November.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not to be questioned that a genuine desire of doing\r\nan act of kindness to his fellow-creatures was a leading motive of\r\nServadac’s proposed visit to Gibraltar, it must be owned that another\r\nidea, confided to nobody, least of all to Count Timascheff, had been\r\nconceived in the brain of the worthy Gascon. Ben Zoof had an inkling\r\nthat his master was “up to some other little game,” when, just before\r\nstarting, he asked him privately whether there was a French tricolor\r\namong the stores. “I believe so,” said the orderly.\r\n\r\n“Then don’t say a word to anyone, but fasten it up tight in your\r\nknapsack.”\r\n\r\nBen Zoof found the flag, and folded it up as he was directed. Before\r\nproceeding to explain this somewhat enigmatical conduct of Servadac,\r\nit is necessary to refer to a certain physiological fact, coincident\r\nbut unconnected with celestial phenomena, originating entirely in the\r\nfrailty of human nature. The nearer that Gallia approached the earth,\r\nthe more a sort of reserve began to spring up between the captain and\r\nCount Timascheff. Though they could not be said to be conscious of\r\nit, the remembrance of their former rivalry, so completely buried in\r\noblivion for the last year and ten months, was insensibly recovering\r\nits hold upon their minds, and the question was all but coming to\r\nthe surface as to what would happen if, on their return to earth, the\r\nhandsome Madame de L---- should still be free. From companions in peril,\r\nwould they not again be avowed rivals? Conceal it as they would, a\r\ncoolness was undeniably stealing over an intimacy which, though it could\r\nnever be called affectionate, had been uniformly friendly and courteous.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it was not surprising that Hector Servadac\r\nshould not have confided to the count a project which, wild as it was,\r\ncould scarcely have failed to widen the unacknowledged breach that was\r\nopening in their friendship.\r\n\r\nThe project was the annexation of Ceuta to the French dominion. The\r\nEnglishmen, rightly enough, had continued to occupy the fragment of\r\nGibraltar, and their claim was indisputable. But the island of Ceuta,\r\nwhich before the shock had commanded the opposite side of the strait,\r\nand had been occupied by Spaniards, had since been abandoned, and was\r\ntherefore free to the first occupant who should lay claim to it. To\r\nplant the tricolor upon it, in the name of France, was now the cherished\r\nwish of Servadac’s heart.\r\n\r\n“Who knows,” he said to himself, “whether Ceuta, on its return to earth,\r\nmay not occupy a grand and commanding situation? What a proud thing it\r\nwould be to have secured its possession to France!”\r\n\r\nNext morning, as soon as they had taken their brief farewell of their\r\nfriends, and were fairly out of sight of the shore, Servadac imparted\r\nhis design to Ben Zoof, who entered into the project with the greatest\r\nzest, and expressed himself delighted, not only at the prospect of\r\nadding to the dominions of his beloved country, but of stealing a march\r\nupon England.\r\n\r\nBoth travelers were warmly clad, the orderly’s knapsack containing all\r\nthe necessary provisions. The journey was accomplished without special\r\nincident; halts were made at regular intervals, for the purpose of\r\ntaking food and rest. The temperature by night as well as by day was\r\nquite endurable, and on the fourth afternoon after starting, thanks to\r\nthe straight course which their compass enabled them to maintain, the\r\nadventurers found themselves within a few miles of Ceuta.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Ben Zoof caught sight of the rock on the western horizon, he\r\nwas all excitement. Just as if he were in a regiment going into action,\r\nhe talked wildly about “columns” and “squares” and “charges.” The\r\ncaptain, although less demonstrative, was hardly less eager to reach the\r\nrock. They both pushed forward with all possible speed till they were\r\nwithin a mile and a half of the shore, when Ben Zoof, who had a very\r\nkeen vision, stopped suddenly, and said that he was sure he could see\r\nsomething moving on the top of the island.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, let us hasten on,” said Servadac. A few minutes carried\r\nthem over another mile, when Ben Zoof stopped again.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Ben Zoof?” asked the captain.\r\n\r\n“It looks to me like a man on a rock, waving his arms in the air,” said\r\nthe orderly.\r\n\r\n“Plague on it!” muttered Servadac; “I hope we are not too late.” Again\r\nthey went on; but soon Ben Zoof stopped for the third time.\r\n\r\n“It is a semaphore, sir; I see it quite distinctly.” And he was not\r\nmistaken; it had been a telegraph in motion that had caught his eye.\r\n\r\n“Plague on it!” repeated the captain.\r\n\r\n“Too late, sir, do you think?” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ben Zoof; if that’s a telegraph--and there is no doubt of\r\nit--somebody has been before us and erected it; and, moreover, if it is\r\nmoving, there must be somebody working it now.”\r\n\r\nHe was keenly disappointed. Looking towards the north, he could\r\ndistinguish Gibraltar faintly visible in the extreme distance, and upon\r\nthe summit of the rock both Ben Zoof and himself fancied they could make\r\nout another semaphore, giving signals, no doubt, in response to the one\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is only too clear; they have already occupied it, and\r\nestablished their communications,” said Servadac.\r\n\r\n“And what are we to do, then?” asked Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“We must pocket our chagrin, and put as good a face on the matter as we\r\ncan,” replied the captain.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps there are only four or five Englishmen to protect the\r\nplace,” said Ben Zoof, as if meditating an assault.\r\n\r\n“No, no, Ben Zoof,” answered Servadac; “we must do nothing rash. We\r\nhave had our warning, and, unless our representations can induce them to\r\nyield their position, we must resign our hope.”\r\n\r\nThus discomfited, they had reached the foot of the rock, when all at\r\nonce, like a “Jack-in-the-box,” a sentinel started up before them with\r\nthe challenge:\r\n\r\n“Who goes there?”\r\n\r\n“Friends. Vive la France!” cried the captain.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for England!” replied the soldier.\r\n\r\nBy this time four other men had made their appearance from the upper\r\npart of the rock.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” asked one of them, whom Servadac remembered to have\r\nseen before at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n“Can I speak to your commanding officer?” Servadac inquired.\r\n\r\n“Which?” said the man. “The officer in command of Ceuta?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if there is one.”\r\n\r\n“I will acquaint him with your arrival,” answered the Englishman, and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the commanding officer, attired in full uniform, was\r\nseen descending to the shore. It was Major Oliphant himself.\r\n\r\nServadac could no longer entertain a doubt that the Englishmen had\r\nforestalled him in the occupation of Ceuta. Provisions and fuel had\r\nevidently been conveyed thither in the boat from Gibraltar before the\r\nsea had frozen, and a solid casemate, hollowed in the rock, had afforded\r\nMajor Oliphant and his contingent ample protection from the rigor of\r\nthe winter. The ascending smoke that rose above the rock was sufficient\r\nevidence that good fires were still kept up; the soldiers appeared to\r\nhave thriven well on what, no doubt, had been a generous diet, and the\r\nmajor himself, although he would scarcely have been willing to allow it,\r\nwas slightly stouter than before.\r\n\r\nBeing only about twelve miles distant from Gibraltar, the little\r\ngarrison at Ceuta had felt itself by no means isolated in its position;\r\nbut by frequent excursions across the frozen strait, and by the constant\r\nuse of the telegraph, had kept up their communication with their\r\nfellow-countrymen on the other island. Colonel Murphy and the major had\r\nnot even been forced to forego the pleasures of the chessboard. The game\r\nthat had been interrupted by Captain Servadac’s former visit was not yet\r\nconcluded; but, like the two American clubs that played their celebrated\r\ngame in 1846 between Washington and Baltimore, the two gallant officers\r\nmade use of the semaphore to communicate their well-digested moves.\r\n\r\nThe major stood waiting for his visitor to speak.\r\n\r\n“Major Oliphant, I believe?” said Servadac, with a courteous bow.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, Major Oliphant, officer in command of the garrison at Ceuta,”\r\n was the Englishman’s reply. “And to whom,” he added, “may I have the\r\nhonor of speaking?”\r\n\r\n“To Captain Servadac, the governor general of Gallia.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said the major, with a supercilious look.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to express my surprise,” resumed the captain, “at seeing you\r\ninstalled as commanding officer upon what I have always understood to be\r\nSpanish soil. May I demand your claim to your position?”\r\n\r\n“My claim is that of first occupant.”\r\n\r\n“But do you not think that the party of Spaniards now resident with me\r\nmay at some future time assert a prior right to the proprietorship?”\r\n\r\n“I think not, Captain Servadac.”\r\n\r\n“But why not?” persisted the captain.\r\n\r\n“Because these very Spaniards have, by formal contract, made over Ceuta,\r\nin its integrity, to the British government.”\r\n\r\nServadac uttered an exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n“And as the price of that important cession,” continued Major Oliphant,\r\n“they have received a fair equivalent in British gold.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Ben Zoof, “that accounts for that fellow Negrete and his\r\npeople having such a lot of money.”\r\n\r\nServadac was silent. It had become clear to his mind what had been the\r\nobject of that secret visit to Ceuta which he had heard of as being made\r\nby the two English officers. The arguments that he had intended to use\r\nhad completely fallen through; all that he had now to do was carefully\r\nto prevent any suspicion of his disappointed project.\r\n\r\n“May I be allowed to ask, Captain Servadac, to what I am indebted for\r\nthe honor of this visit?” asked Major Oliphant presently.\r\n\r\n“I have come, Major Oliphant, in the hope of doing you and your\r\ncompanions a service,” replied Servadac, rousing himself from his\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!” replied the major, as though he felt himself quite\r\nindependent of all services from exterior sources.\r\n\r\n“I thought, major, that it was not unlikely you were in ignorance of\r\nthe fact that both Ceuta and Gibraltar have been traversing the solar\r\nregions on the surface of a comet.”\r\n\r\nThe major smiled incredulously; but Servadac, nothing daunted, went on\r\nto detail the results of the collision between the comet and the earth,\r\nadding that, as there was the almost immediate prospect of another\r\nconcussion, it had occurred to him that it might be advisable for the\r\nwhole population of Gallia to unite in taking precautionary measures for\r\nthe common welfare.\r\n\r\n“In fact, Major Oliphant,” he said in conclusion, “I am here to inquire\r\nwhether you and your friends would be disposed to join us in our present\r\nquarters.”\r\n\r\n“I am obliged to you, Captain Servadac,” answered the major stiffly;\r\n“but we have not the slightest intention of abandoning our post. We have\r\nreceived no government orders to that effect; indeed, we have received\r\nno orders at all. Our own dispatch to the First Lord of the Admiralty\r\nstill awaits the mail.”\r\n\r\n“But allow me to repeat,” insisted Servadac, “that we are no longer on\r\nthe earth, although we expect to come in contact with it again in about\r\neight weeks.”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt,” the major answered, “that England will make every\r\neffort to reclaim us.”\r\n\r\nServadac felt perplexed. It was quite evident that Major Oliphant had\r\nnot been convinced of the truth of one syllable of what he had been\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n“Then I am to understand that you are determined to retain your two\r\ngarrisons here and at Gibraltar?” asked Servadac, with one last effort\r\nat persuasion.\r\n\r\n“Certainly; these two posts command the entrance of the Mediterranean.”\r\n\r\n“But supposing there is no longer any Mediterranean?” retorted the\r\ncaptain, growing impatient.\r\n\r\n“Oh, England will always take care of that,” was Major Oliphant’s cool\r\nreply. “But excuse me,” he added presently; “I see that Colonel\r\nMurphy has just telegraphed his next move. Allow me to wish you\r\ngood-afternoon.”\r\n\r\nAnd without further parley, followed by his soldiers, he retired into\r\nthe casemate, leaving Captain Servadac gnawing his mustache with mingled\r\nrage and mortification.\r\n\r\n“A fine piece of business we have made of this!” said Ben Zoof, when he\r\nfound himself alone with his master.\r\n\r\n“We will make our way back at once,” replied Captain Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the sooner the better, with our tails between our legs,” rejoined\r\nthe orderly, who this time felt no inclination to start off to the march\r\nof the Algerian zephyrs. And so the French tricolor returned as it had\r\nset out--in Ben Zoof’s knapsack.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth evening after starting, the travelers again set foot on\r\nthe volcanic promontory just in time to witness a great commotion.\r\n\r\nPalmyrin Rosette was in a furious rage. He had completed all his\r\ncalculations about Nerina, but that perfidious satellite had totally\r\ndisappeared. The astronomer was frantic at the loss of his moon.\r\nCaptured probably by some larger body, it was revolving in its proper\r\nzone of the minor planets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. A BOLD PROPOSITION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his return Servadac communicated to the count the result of his\r\nexpedition, and, though perfectly silent on the subject of his personal\r\nproject, did not conceal the fact that the Spaniards, without the\r\nsmallest right, had sold Ceuta to the English.\r\n\r\nHaving refused to quit their post, the Englishmen had virtually excluded\r\nthemselves from any further consideration; they had had their warning,\r\nand must now take the consequences of their own incredulity.\r\n\r\nAlthough it had proved that not a single creature either at Gourbi\r\nIsland, Gibraltar, Ceuta, Madalena, or Formentera had received any\r\ninjury whatever at the time of the first concussion, there was nothing\r\nin the least to make it certain that a like immunity from harm would\r\nattend the second. The previous escape was doubtless owing to some\r\nslight, though unaccountable, modification in the rate of motion; but\r\nwhether the inhabitants of the earth had fared so fortunately, was a\r\nquestion that had still to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe day following Servadac’s return, he and the count and Lieutenant\r\nProcope met by agreement in the cave, formally to discuss what would be\r\nthe most advisable method of proceeding under their present prospects.\r\nBen Zoof was, as a matter of course, allowed to be present, and\r\nProfessor Rosette had been asked to attend; but he declined on the plea\r\nof taking no interest in the matter. Indeed, the disappearance of his\r\nmoon had utterly disconcerted him, and the probability that he should\r\nsoon lose his comet also, plunged him into an excess of grief which he\r\npreferred to bear in solitude.\r\n\r\nAlthough the barrier of cool reserve was secretly increasing between the\r\ncaptain and the count, they scrupulously concealed any outward token of\r\ntheir inner feelings, and without any personal bias applied their best\r\nenergies to the discussion of the question which was of such mutual,\r\nnay, of such universal interest.\r\n\r\nServadac was the first to speak. “In fifty-one days, if Professor\r\nRosette has made no error in his calculations, there is to be a\r\nrecurrence of collision between this comet and the earth. The inquiry\r\nthat we have now to make is whether we are prepared for the coming\r\nshock. I ask myself, and I ask you, whether it is in our power, by\r\nany means, to avert the evil consequences that are only too likely to\r\nfollow?”\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff, in a voice that seemed to thrill with solemnity, said:\r\n“In such events we are at the disposal of an over-ruling Providence;\r\nhuman precautions cannot sway the Divine will.”\r\n\r\n“But with the most profound reverence for the will of Providence,”\r\n replied the captain, “I beg to submit that it is our duty to devise\r\nwhatever means we can to escape the threatening mischief. Heaven helps\r\nthem that help themselves.”\r\n\r\n“And what means have you to suggest, may I ask?” said the count, with a\r\nfaint accent of satire.\r\n\r\nServadac was forced to acknowledge that nothing tangible had hitherto\r\npresented itself to his mind.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to intrude,” observed Ben Zoof, “but I don’t understand\r\nwhy such learned gentlemen as you cannot make the comet go where you\r\nwant it to go.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, Ben Zoof, about our learning,” said the captain;\r\n“even Professor Rosette, with all his learning, has not a shadow of\r\npower to prevent the comet and the earth from knocking against each\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“Then I cannot see what is the use of all this learning,” the orderly\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“One great use of learning,” said Count Timascheff with a smile, “is to\r\nmake us know our own ignorance.”\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation had been going on, Lieutenant Procope had been\r\nsitting in thoughtful silence. Looking up, he now said, “Incident to\r\nthis expected shock, there may be a variety of dangers. If, gentlemen,\r\nyou will allow me, I will enumerate them; and we shall, perhaps, by\r\ntaking them _seriatim_, be in a better position to judge whether we\r\ncan successfully grapple with them, or in any way mitigate their\r\nconsequences.”\r\n\r\nThere was a general attitude of attention. It was surprising how calmly\r\nthey proceeded to discuss the circumstances that looked so threatening\r\nand ominous.\r\n\r\n“First of all,” resumed the lieutenant, “we will specify the different\r\nways in which the shock may happen.”\r\n\r\n“And the prime fact to be remembered,” interposed Servadac, “is that the\r\ncombined velocity of the two bodies will be about 21,000 miles an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Express speed, and no mistake!” muttered Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“Just so,” assented Procope. “Now, the two bodies may impinge either\r\ndirectly or obliquely. If the impact is sufficiently oblique, Gallia may\r\ndo precisely what she did before: she may graze the earth; she may,\r\nor she may not, carry off a portion of the earth’s atmosphere and\r\nsubstance, and so she may float away again into space; but her orbit\r\nwould undoubtedly be deranged, and if we survive the shock, we\r\nshall have small chance of ever returning to the world of our\r\nfellow-creatures.”\r\n\r\n“Professor Rosette, I suppose,” Ben Zoof remarked, “would pretty soon\r\nfind out all about that.”\r\n\r\n“But we will leave this hypothesis,” said the lieutenant; “our\r\nown experience has sufficiently shown us its advantages and its\r\ndisadvantages. We will proceed to consider the infinitely more serious\r\nalternative of direct impact; of a shock that would hurl the comet\r\nstraight on to the earth, to which it would become attached.”\r\n\r\n“A great wart upon her face!” said Ben Zoof, laughing.\r\n\r\nThe captain held up his finger to his orderly, making him understand\r\nthat he should hold his tongue.\r\n\r\n“It is, I presume, to be taken for granted,” continued Lieutenant\r\nProcope, “that the mass of the earth is comparatively so large that, in\r\nthe event of a direct collision, her own motion would not be sensibly\r\nretarded, and that she would carry the comet along with her, as part of\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\n“Very little question of that, I should think,” said Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” the lieutenant went on, “what part of this comet of ours\r\nwill be the part to come into collision with the earth? It may be the\r\nequator, where we are; it may be at the exactly opposite point, at our\r\nantipodes; or it may be at either pole. In any case, it seems hard to\r\nforesee whence there is to come the faintest chance of deliverance.”\r\n\r\n“Is the case so desperate?” asked Servadac.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you why it seems so. If the side of the comet on which we\r\nare resident impinges on the earth, it stands to reason that we must be\r\ncrushed to atoms by the violence of the concussion.”\r\n\r\n“Regular mincemeat!” said Ben Zoof, whom no admonitions could quite\r\nreduce to silence.\r\n\r\n“And if,” said the lieutenant, after a moment’s pause, and the slightest\r\npossible frown at the interruption--“and if the collision should occur\r\nat our antipodes, the sudden check to the velocity of the comet would be\r\nquite equivalent to a shock _in situ_; and, another thing, we should run\r\nthe risk of being suffocated, for all our comet’s atmosphere would be\r\nassimilated with the terrestrial atmosphere, and we, supposing we were\r\nnot dashed to atoms, should be left as it were upon the summit of an\r\nenormous mountain (for such to all intents and purposes Gallia would\r\nbe), 450 miles above the level of the surface of the globe, without a\r\nparticle of air to breathe.”\r\n\r\n“But would not our chances of escape be considerably better,” asked\r\nCount Timascheff, “in the event of either of the comet’s poles being the\r\npoint of contact?”\r\n\r\n“Taking the combined velocity into account,” answered the lieutenant,\r\n“I confess that I fear the violence of the shock will be too great to\r\npermit our destruction to be averted.”\r\n\r\nA general silence ensued, which was broken by the lieutenant himself.\r\n“Even if none of these contingencies occur in the way we have\r\ncontemplated, I am driven to the suspicion that we shall be burnt\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\n“Burnt alive!” they all exclaimed in a chorus of horror.\r\n\r\n“Yes. If the deductions of modern science be true, the speed of the\r\ncomet, when suddenly checked, will be transmuted into heat, and that\r\nheat will be so intense that the temperature of the comet will be raised\r\nto some millions of degrees.”\r\n\r\nNo one having anything definite to allege in reply to Lieutenant\r\nProcope’s forebodings, they all relapsed into silence. Presently Ben\r\nZoof asked whether it was not possible for the comet to fall into the\r\nmiddle of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nProcope shook his head. “Even so, we should only be adding the fate of\r\ndrowning to the list of our other perils.”\r\n\r\n“Then, as I understand,” said Captain Servadac, “in whatever way or\r\nin whatever place the concussion occurs, we must be either crushed,\r\nsuffocated, roasted, or drowned. Is that your conclusion, lieutenant?”\r\n\r\n“I confess I see no other alternative,” answered Procope, calmly.\r\n\r\n“But isn’t there another thing to be done?” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” his master asked.\r\n\r\n“Why, to get off the comet before the shock comes.”\r\n\r\n“How could you get off Gallia?”\r\n\r\n“That I can’t say,” replied the orderly.\r\n\r\n“I am not sure that that could not be accomplished,” said the\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\nAll eyes in a moment were riveted upon him, as, with his head resting\r\non his hands, he was manifestly cogitating a new idea. “Yes, I think\r\nit could be accomplished,” he repeated. “The project may appear\r\nextravagant, but I do not know why it should be impossible. Ben Zoof has\r\nhit the right nail on the head; we must try and leave Gallia before the\r\nshock.”\r\n\r\n“Leave Gallia! How?” said Count Timascheff.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant did not at once reply. He continued pondering for a time,\r\nand at last said, slowly and distinctly, “By making a balloon!”\r\n\r\nServadac’s heart sank.\r\n\r\n“A balloon!” he exclaimed. “Out of the question! Balloons are exploded\r\nthings. You hardly find them in novels. Balloon, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me,” replied Procope. “Perhaps I can convince you that my\r\nidea is not so chimerical as you imagine.” And, knitting his brow, he\r\nproceeded to establish the feasibility of his plan. “If we can ascertain\r\nthe precise moment when the shock is to happen, and can succeed\r\nin launching ourselves a sufficient time beforehand into Gallia’s\r\natmosphere, I believe it will transpire that this atmosphere will\r\namalgamate with that of the earth, and that a balloon whirled along by\r\nthe combined velocity would glide into the mingled atmosphere and remain\r\nsuspended in mid-air until the shock of the collision is overpast.”\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff reflected for a minute, and said, “I think, lieutenant,\r\nI understand your project. The scheme seems tenable; and I shall be\r\nready to co-operate with you, to the best of my power, in putting it\r\ninto execution.”\r\n\r\n“Only, remember,” continued Procope, “there are many chances to one\r\nagainst our success. One instant’s obstruction and stoppage in our\r\npassage, and our balloon is burnt to ashes. Still, reluctant as I am to\r\nacknowledge it, I confess that I feel our sole hope of safety rests in\r\nour getting free from this comet.”\r\n\r\n“If the chances were ten thousand to one against us,” said Servadac, “I\r\nthink the attempt ought to be made.”\r\n\r\n“But have we hydrogen enough to inflate a balloon?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n“Hot air will be all that we shall require,” the lieutenant answered;\r\n“we are only contemplating about an hour’s journey.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, a fire-balloon! A montgolfier!” cried Servadac. “But what are you\r\ngoing to do for a casing?”\r\n\r\n“I have thought of that. We must cut it out of the sails of the\r\n_Dobryna_; they are both light and strong,” rejoined the lieutenant.\r\nCount Timascheff complimented the lieutenant upon his ingenuity, and Ben\r\nZoof could not resist bringing the meeting to a conclusion by a ringing\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\nTruly daring was the plan of which Lieutenant Procope had thus become\r\nthe originator; but the very existence of them all was at stake, and the\r\ndesign must be executed resolutely. For the success of the enterprise it\r\nwas absolutely necessary to know, almost to a minute, the precise time\r\nat which the collision would occur, and Captain Servadac undertook the\r\ntask, by gentle means or by stern, of extracting the secret from the\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nTo Lieutenant Procope himself was entrusted the superintendence of the\r\nconstruction of the montgolfier, and the work was begun at once. It was\r\nto be large enough to carry the whole of the twenty-three residents in\r\nthe volcano, and, in order to provide the means of floating aloft\r\nlong enough to give time for selecting a proper place for descent, the\r\nlieutenant was anxious to make it carry enough hay or straw to maintain\r\ncombustion for a while, and keep up the necessary supply of heated air.\r\n\r\nThe sails of the _Dobryna_, which had all been carefully stowed away in\r\nthe Hive, were of a texture unusually close, and quite capable of being\r\nmade airtight by means of a varnish, the ingredients of which were\r\nrummaged out of the promiscuous stores of the tartan. The lieutenant\r\nhimself traced out the pattern and cut out the strips, and all hands\r\nwere employed in seaming them together. It was hardly the work for\r\nlittle fingers, but Nina persisted in accomplishing her own share of it.\r\nThe Russians were quite at home at occupation of this sort, and having\r\ninitiated the Spaniards into its mysteries, the task of joining together\r\nthe casing was soon complete. Isaac Hakkabut and the professor were\r\nthe only two members of the community who took no part in this somewhat\r\ntedious proceeding.\r\n\r\nA month passed away, but Servadac found no opportunity of getting at the\r\ninformation he had pledged himself to gain. On the sole occasion when he\r\nhad ventured to broach the subject with the astronomer, he had received\r\nfor answer that as there was no hurry to get back to the earth, there\r\nneed be no concern about any dangers of transit.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as time passed on, the professor seemed to become more and more\r\ninaccessible. A pleasant temperature enabled him to live entirely in his\r\nobservatory, from which intruders were rigidly shut out. But Servadac\r\nbided his time. He grew more and more impressed with the importance of\r\nfinding out the exact moment at which the impact would take place,\r\nbut was content to wait for a promising opportunity to put any fresh\r\nquestions on the subject to the too reticent astronomer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the earth’s disc was daily increasing in magnitude; the comet\r\ntraveled 50,000,000 leagues during the month, at the close of which it\r\nwas not more than 78,000,000 leagues from the sun.\r\n\r\nA thaw had now fairly set in. The breaking up of the frozen ocean was a\r\nmagnificent spectacle, and “the great voice of the sea,” as the whalers\r\ngraphically describe it, was heard in all its solemnity. Little streams\r\nof water began to trickle down the declivities of the mountain and along\r\nthe shelving shore, only to be transformed, as the melting of the snow\r\ncontinued, into torrents or cascades. Light vapors gathered on the\r\nhorizon, and clouds were formed and carried rapidly along by breezes to\r\nwhich the Gallian atmosphere had long been unaccustomed. All these\r\nwere doubtless but the prelude to atmospheric disturbances of a more\r\nstartling character; but as indications of returning spring, they were\r\ngreeted with a welcome which no apprehensions for the future could\r\nprevent being glad and hearty.\r\n\r\nA double disaster was the inevitable consequence of the thaw. Both the\r\nschooner and the tartan were entirely destroyed. The basement of the icy\r\npedestal on which the ships had been upheaved was gradually undermined,\r\nlike the icebergs of the Arctic Ocean, by warm currents of water, and\r\non the night of the 12th the huge block collapsed _en masse_, so that on\r\nthe following morning nothing remained of the _Dobryna_ and the _Hansa_\r\nexcept the fragments scattered on the shore.\r\n\r\nAlthough certainly expected, the catastrophe could not fail to cause a\r\nsense of general depression. Well-nigh one of their last ties to Mother\r\nEarth had been broken; the ships were gone, and they had only a balloon\r\nto replace them!\r\n\r\nTo describe Isaac Hakkabut’s rage at the destruction of the tartan would\r\nbe impossible. His oaths were simply dreadful; his imprecations on the\r\naccursed race were full of wrath. He swore that Servadac and his people\r\nwere responsible for his loss; he vowed that they should be sued and\r\nmade to pay him damages; he asserted that he had been brought from\r\nGourbi Island only to be plundered; in fact, he became so intolerably\r\nabusive, that Servadac threatened to put him into irons unless he\r\nconducted himself properly; whereupon the Jew, finding that the captain\r\nwas in earnest, and would not hesitate to carry the threat into effect,\r\nwas fain to hold his tongue, and slunk back into his dim hole.\r\n\r\nBy the 14th the balloon was finished, and, carefully sewn and well\r\nvarnished as it had been, it was really a very substantial structure. It\r\nwas covered with a network that had been made from the light rigging\r\nof the yacht, and the car, composed of wicker-work that had formed\r\npartitions in the hold of the _Hansa_, was quite commodious enough to\r\nhold the twenty-three passengers it was intended to convey. No thought\r\nhad been bestowed upon comfort or convenience, as the ascent was to\r\nlast for so short a time, merely long enough for making the transit from\r\natmosphere to atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe necessity was becoming more and more urgent to get at the true\r\nhour of the approaching contact, but the professor seemed to grow more\r\nobstinate than ever in his resolution to keep his secret.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th the comet crossed the orbit of Mars, at the safe distance\r\nof 56,000,000 leagues; but during that night the community thought\r\nthat their last hour had taken them unawares. The volcano rocked and\r\ntrembled with the convulsions of internal disturbance, and Servadac and\r\nhis companions, convinced that the mountain was doomed to some sudden\r\ndisruption, rushed into the open air.\r\n\r\nThe first object that caught their attention as they emerged upon the\r\nopen rocks was the unfortunate professor, who was scrambling down\r\nthe mountain-side, piteously displaying a fragment of his shattered\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nIt was no time for condolence.\r\n\r\nA new marvel arrested every eye. A fresh satellite, in the gloom of\r\nnight, was shining conspicuously before them.\r\n\r\nThat satellite was a part of Gallia itself!\r\n\r\nBy the expansive action of the inner heat, Gallia, like Gambart’s comet,\r\nhad been severed in twain; an enormous fragment had been detached and\r\nlaunched into space!\r\n\r\nThe fragment included Ceuta and Gibraltar, with the two English\r\ngarrisons!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. THE VENTURE MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would be the consequences of this sudden and complete disruption,\r\nServadac and his people hardly dared to think.\r\n\r\nThe first change that came under their observation was the rapidity of\r\nthe sun’s appearances and disappearances, forcing them to the conviction\r\nthat although the comet still rotated on its axis from east to west, yet\r\nthe period of its rotation had been diminished by about one-half. Only\r\nsix hours instead of twelve elapsed between sunrise and sunrise; three\r\nhours after rising in the west the sun was sinking again in the east.\r\n\r\n“We are coming to something!” exclaimed Servadac. “We have got a year of\r\nsomething like 2,880 days.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t think it would be an easy matter to find saints enough for\r\nsuch a calendar as that!” said Ben Zoof.\r\n\r\nServadac laughed, and remarked that they should have the professor\r\ntalking about the 238th of June, and the 325th of December.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that the detached portion was not revolving\r\nround the comet, but was gradually retreating into space. Whether it\r\nhad carried with it any portion of atmosphere, whether it possessed\r\nany other condition for supporting life, and whether it was likely ever\r\nagain to approach to the earth, were all questions that there were no\r\nmeans of determining. For themselves the all-important problem was--what\r\neffect would the rending asunder of the comet have upon its rate of\r\nprogress? and as they were already conscious of a further increase of\r\nmuscular power, and a fresh diminution of specific gravity, Servadac and\r\nhis associates could not but wonder whether the alteration in the mass\r\nof the comet would not result in its missing the expected coincidence\r\nwith the earth altogether.\r\n\r\nAlthough he professed himself incompetent to pronounce a decided\r\nopinion, Lieutenant Procope manifestly inclined to the belief that no\r\nalteration would ensue in the rate of Gallia’s velocity; but Rosette, no\r\ndoubt, could answer the question directly, and the time had now\r\narrived in which he must be compelled to divulge the precise moment of\r\ncollision.\r\n\r\nBut the professor was in the worst of tempers. Generally taciturn and\r\nmorose, he was more than usually uncivil whenever any one ventured to\r\nspeak to him. The loss of his telescope had doubtless a great deal to do\r\nwith his ill-humor; but the captain drew the most favorable conclusions\r\nfrom Rosette’s continued irritation. Had the comet been in any way\r\nprojected from its course, so as to be likely to fail in coming into\r\ncontact with the earth, the professor would have been quite unable\r\nto conceal his satisfaction. But they required to know more than the\r\ngeneral truth, and felt that they had no time to lose in getting at the\r\nexact details.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity that was wanted soon came.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, Rosette was overheard in furious altercation with Ben Zoof.\r\nThe orderly had been taunting the astronomer with the mutilation of his\r\nlittle comet. A fine thing, he said, to split in two like a child’s toy.\r\nIt had cracked like a dry nut; and mightn’t one as well live upon an\r\nexploding bomb?--with much more to the same effect. The professor, by\r\nway of retaliation, had commenced sneering at the “prodigious” mountain\r\nof Montmartre, and the dispute was beginning to look serious when\r\nServadac entered.\r\n\r\nThinking he could turn the wrangling to some good account, so as to\r\narrive at the information he was so anxiously seeking, the captain\r\npretended to espouse the views of his orderly; he consequently brought\r\nupon himself the full force of the professor’s wrath.\r\n\r\nRosette’s language became more and more violent, till Servadac, feigning\r\nto be provoked beyond endurance, cried:\r\n\r\n“You forget, sir, that you are addressing the Governor-General of\r\nGallia.”\r\n\r\n“Governor-General! humbug!” roared Rosette. “Gallia is my comet!”\r\n\r\n“I deny it,” said Servadac. “Gallia has lost its chance of getting back\r\nto the earth. Gallia has nothing to do with you. Gallia is mine; and you\r\nmust submit to the government which I please to ordain.”\r\n\r\n“And who told you that Gallia is not going back to the earth?” asked the\r\nprofessor, with a look of withering scorn.\r\n\r\n“Why, isn’t her mass diminished? Isn’t she split in half? Isn’t her\r\nvelocity all altered?” demanded the captain.\r\n\r\n“And pray who told you this?” again said the professor, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n“Everybody. Everybody knows it, of course,” replied Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Everybody is very clever. And you always were a very clever scholar\r\ntoo. We remember that of old, don’t we?”\r\n\r\n“Sir!”\r\n\r\n“You nearly mastered the first elements of science, didn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Sir!”\r\n\r\n“A credit to your class!”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue, sir!” bellowed the captain again, as if his anger was\r\nuncontrollable.\r\n\r\n“Not I,” said the professor.\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue!” repeated Servadac.\r\n\r\n“Just because the mass is altered you think the velocity is altered?”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue!” cried the captain, louder than ever.\r\n\r\n“What has mass to do with the orbit? Of how many comets do you know the\r\nmass, and yet you know their movements? Ignorance!” shouted Rosette.\r\n\r\n“Insolence!” retorted Servadac.\r\n\r\nBen Zoof, really thinking that his master was angry, made a threatening\r\nmovement towards the professor.\r\n\r\n“Touch me if you dare!” screamed Rosette, drawing himself up to the\r\nfullest height his diminutive figure would allow. “You shall answer for\r\nyour conduct before a court of justice!”\r\n\r\n“Where? On Gallia?” asked the captain.\r\n\r\n“No; on the earth.”\r\n\r\n“The earth! Pshaw! You know we shall never get there; our velocity is\r\nchanged.”\r\n\r\n“On the earth,” repeated the professor, with decision.\r\n\r\n“Trash!” cried Ben Zoof. “The earth will be too far off!”\r\n\r\n“Not too far off for us to come across her orbit at 42 minutes and 35.6\r\nseconds past two o’clock on the morning of this coming 1st of January.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my dear professor--many thanks. You have given me all the\r\ninformation I required;” and, with a low bow and a gracious smile, the\r\ncaptain withdrew. The orderly made an equally polite bow, and followed\r\nhis master. The professor, completely nonplussed, was left alone.\r\n\r\nThirteen days, then--twenty-six of the original Gallian days, fifty-two\r\nof the present--was all the time for preparation that now remained.\r\nEvery preliminary arrangement was hurried on with the greatest\r\nearnestness.\r\n\r\nThere was a general eagerness to be quit of Gallia. Indifferent to\r\nthe dangers that must necessarily attend a balloon ascent under such\r\nunparalleled circumstances, and heedless of Lieutenant Procope’s warning\r\nthat the slightest check in their progress would result in instantaneous\r\ncombustion, they all seemed to conclude that it must be the simplest\r\nthing possible to glide from one atmosphere to another, so that they\r\nwere quite sanguine as to the successful issue of their enterprise.\r\nCaptain Servadac made a point of showing himself quite enthusiastic in\r\nhis anticipations, and to Ben Zoof the going up in a balloon was the\r\nsupreme height of his ambition. The count and the lieutenant, of colder\r\nand less demonstrative temperament, alike seemed to realize the possible\r\nperils of the undertaking, but even they were determined to put a bold\r\nface upon every difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe sea had now become navigable, and three voyages were made to Gourbi\r\nIsland in the steam launch, consuming the last of their little reserve\r\nof coal.\r\n\r\nThe first voyage had been made by Servadac with several of the sailors.\r\nThey found the gourbi and the adjacent building quite uninjured by\r\nthe severity of the winter; numbers of little rivulets intersected the\r\npasture-land; new plants were springing up under the influence of the\r\nequatorial sun, and the luxuriant foliage was tenanted by the birds\r\nwhich had flown back from the volcano. Summer had almost abruptly\r\nsucceeded to winter, and the days, though only three hours long, were\r\nintensely hot.\r\n\r\nAnother of the voyages to the island had been to collect the dry grass\r\nand straw which was necessary for inflating the balloon. Had the balloon\r\nbeen less cumbersome it would have been conveyed to the island,\r\nwhence the start would have been effected; but as it was, it was more\r\nconvenient to bring the combustible material to the balloon.\r\n\r\nThe last of the coal having been consumed, the fragments of the\r\nshipwrecked vessels had to be used day by day for fuel. Hakkabut began\r\nmaking a great hubbub when he found that they were burning some of the\r\nspars of the _Hansa_; but he was effectually silenced by Ben Zoof, who\r\ntold him that if he made any more fuss, he should be compelled to pay\r\n50,000 francs for a balloon-ticket, or else he should be left behind.\r\n\r\nBy Christmas Day everything was in readiness for immediate departure.\r\nThe festival was observed with a solemnity still more marked than the\r\nanniversary of the preceding year. Every one looked forward to spending\r\nNew Year’s Day in another sphere altogether, and Ben Zoof had already\r\npromised Pablo and Nina all sorts of New Year’s gifts.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange, but the nearer the critical moment approached, the\r\nless Hector Servadac and Count Timascheff had to say to each other on\r\nthe subject. Their mutual reserve became more apparent; the experiences\r\nof the last two years were fading from their minds like a dream; and the\r\nfair image that had been the cause of their original rivalry was ever\r\nrising, as a vision, between them.\r\n\r\nThe captain’s thoughts began to turn to his unfinished rondo; in\r\nhis leisure moments, rhymes suitable and unsuitable, possible and\r\nimpossible, were perpetually jingling in his imagination. He labored\r\nunder the conviction that he had a work of genius to complete. A poet he\r\nhad left the earth, and a poet he must return.\r\n\r\nCount Timascheff’s desire to return to the world was quite equaled by\r\nLieutenant Procope’s. The Russian sailors’ only thought was to follow\r\ntheir master, wherever he went. The Spaniards, though they would have\r\nbeen unconcerned to know that they were to remain upon Gallia, were\r\nnevertheless looking forward with some degree of pleasure to revisiting\r\nthe plains of Andalusia; and Nina and Pablo were only too delighted\r\nat the prospect of accompanying their kind protectors on any fresh\r\nexcursion whatever.\r\n\r\nThe only malcontent was Palmyrin Rosette. Day and night he persevered\r\nin his astronomical pursuits, declared his intention of never abandoning\r\nhis comet, and swore positively that nothing should induce him to set\r\nfoot in the car of the balloon.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune that had befallen his telescope was a never-ending theme\r\nof complaint; and just now, when Gallia was entering the narrow zone of\r\nshooting-stars, and new discoveries might have been within his reach,\r\nhis loss made him more inconsolable than ever. In sheer desperation, he\r\nendeavored to increase the intensity of his vision by applying to his\r\neyes some belladonna which he found in the _Dobryna’s_ medicine chest;\r\nwith heroic fortitude he endured the tortures of the experiment, and\r\ngazed up into the sky until he was nearly blind. But all in vain; not a\r\nsingle fresh discovery rewarded his sufferings.\r\n\r\nNo one was quite exempt from the feverish excitement which prevailed\r\nduring the last days of December. Lieutenant Procope superintended his\r\nfinal arrangements. The two low masts of the schooner had been erected\r\nfirmly on the shore, and formed supports for the montgolfier, which had\r\nbeen duly covered with the netting, and was ready at any moment to\r\nbe inflated. The car was close at hand. Some inflated skins had been\r\nattached to its sides, so that the balloon might float for a time, in\r\nthe event of its descending in the sea at a short distance from the\r\nshore. If unfortunately, it should come down in mid-ocean, nothing but\r\nthe happy chance of some passing vessel could save them all from the\r\ncertain fate of being drowned.\r\n\r\nThe 31st came. Twenty-four hours hence and the balloon, with its large\r\nliving freight, would be high in the air. The atmosphere was less\r\nbuoyant than that of the earth, but no difficulty in ascending was to be\r\napprehended.\r\n\r\nGallia was now within 96,000,000 miles of the sun, consequently not much\r\nmore than 4,000,000 miles from the earth; and this interval was being\r\ndiminished at the rate of nearly 208,000 miles an hour, the speed of the\r\nearth being about 70,000 miles, that of the comet being little less than\r\n138,000 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to make the start at two o’clock, three-quarters of\r\nan hour, or, to speak correctly 42 minutes 35.6 seconds, before the time\r\npredicted by the professor as the instant of collision. The modified\r\nrotation of the comet caused it to be daylight at the time.\r\n\r\nAn hour previously the balloon was inflated with perfect success,\r\nand the car was securely attached to the network. It only awaited the\r\nstowage of the passengers.\r\n\r\nIsaac Hakkabut was the first to take his place in the car. But scarcely\r\nhad he done so, when Servadac noticed that his waist was encompassed\r\nby an enormous girdle that bulged out to a very extraordinary extent.\r\n“What’s all this, Hakkabut?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It’s only my little bit of money, your Excellency; my modest little\r\nfortune--a mere bagatelle,” said the Jew.\r\n\r\n“And what may your little fortune weigh?” inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n“Only about sixty-six pounds!” said Isaac.\r\n\r\n“Sixty-six pounds!” cried Servadac. “We haven’t reckoned for this.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful heavens!” began the Jew.\r\n\r\n“Sixty-six pounds!” repeated Servadac. “We can hardly carry ourselves;\r\nwe can’t have any dead weight here. Pitch it out, man, pitch it out!”\r\n\r\n“God of Israel!” whined Hakkabut.\r\n\r\n“Out with it, I say!” cried Servadac.\r\n\r\n“What, all my money, which I have saved so long, and toiled for so\r\nhard?”\r\n\r\n“It can’t be helped,” said the captain, unmoved.\r\n\r\n“Oh, your Excellency!” cried the Jew.\r\n\r\n“Now, old Nicodemus, listen to me,” interposed Ben Zoof; “you just get\r\nrid of that pouch of yours, or we will get rid of you. Take your choice.\r\nQuick, or out you go!”\r\n\r\nThe avaricious old man was found to value his life above his money; he\r\nmade a lamentable outcry about it, but he unfastened his girdle at last,\r\nand put it out of the car.\r\n\r\nVery different was the case with Palmyrin Rosette. He avowed over and\r\nover again his intention of never quitting the nucleus of his comet. Why\r\nshould he trust himself to a balloon, that would blaze up like a piece\r\nof paper? Why should he leave the comet? Why should he not go once again\r\nupon its surface into the far-off realms of space?\r\n\r\nHis volubility was brought to a sudden check by Servadac’s bidding two\r\nof the sailors, without more ado, to take him in their arms and put him\r\nquietly down at the bottom of the car.\r\n\r\nTo the great regret of their owners, the two horses and Nina’s pet goat\r\nwere obliged to be left behind. The only creature for which there was\r\nfound a place was the carrier-pigeon that had brought the professor’s\r\nmessage to the Hive. Servadac thought it might probably be of service in\r\ncarrying some communication to the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen every one, except the captain and his orderly, had taken their\r\nplaces, Servadac said, “Get in, Ben Zoof.”\r\n\r\n“After you, sir,” said Ben Zoof, respectfully.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” insisted Servadac; “the captain must be the last to leave the\r\nship!”\r\n\r\nA moment’s hesitation and the orderly clambered over the side of the\r\ncar. Servadac followed. The cords were cut. The balloon rose with\r\nstately calmness into the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. SUSPENSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the balloon had reached an elevation of about 2,500 yards,\r\nLieutenant Procope determined to maintain it at that level. A wire-work\r\nstove, suspended below the casing, and filled with lighted hay, served\r\nto keep the air in the interior at a proper temperature.\r\n\r\nBeneath their feet was extended the basin of the Gallian Sea. An\r\ninconsiderable speck to the north marked the site of Gourbi Island.\r\nCeuta and Gibraltar, which might have been expected in the west, had\r\nutterly disappeared. On the south rose the volcano, the extremity of the\r\npromontory that jutted out from the continent that formed the framework\r\nof the sea; whilst in every direction the strange soil, with its\r\ncommixture of tellurium and gold, gleamed under the sun’s rays with a\r\nperpetual iridescence.\r\n\r\nApparently rising with them in their ascent, the horizon was\r\nwell-defined. The sky above them was perfectly clear; but away in the\r\nnorthwest, in opposition to the sun, floated a new sphere, so small that\r\nit could not be an asteroid, but like a dim meteor. It was the fragment\r\nthat the internal convulsion had rent from the surface of the comet,\r\nand which was now many thousands of leagues away, pursuing the new orbit\r\ninto which it had been projected. During the hours of daylight it\r\nwas far from distinct, but after nightfall it would assume a definite\r\nluster.\r\n\r\nThe object, however, of supreme interest was the great expanse of the\r\nterrestrial disc, which was rapidly drawing down obliquely towards them.\r\nIt totally eclipsed an enormous portion of the firmament above, and\r\napproaching with an ever-increasing velocity, was now within half its\r\naverage distance from the moon. So close was it, that the two poles\r\ncould not be embraced in one focus. Irregular patches of greater or\r\nless brilliancy alternated on its surface, the brighter betokening the\r\ncontinents, the more somber indicating the oceans that absorbed the\r\nsolar rays. Above, there were broad white bands, darkened on the side\r\naverted from the sun, exhibiting a slow but unintermittent movement;\r\nthese were the vapors that pervaded the terrestrial atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut as the aeronauts were being hurried on at a speed of 70 miles\r\na second, this vague aspect of the earth soon developed itself into\r\ndefinite outlines. Mountains and plains were no longer confused, the\r\ndistinction between sea and shore was more plainly identified, and\r\ninstead of being, as it were, depicted on a map, the surface of the\r\nearth appeared as though modelled in relief.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven minutes past two, and Gallia is only 72,000 miles from the\r\nterrestrial sphere; quicker and quicker is the velocity; ten minutes\r\nlater, and they are only 36,000 miles apart!\r\n\r\nThe whole configuration of the earth is clear.\r\n\r\n“Europe! Russia! France!” shout Procope, the count, and Servadac, almost\r\nin a breath.\r\n\r\nAnd they are not mistaken. The eastern hemisphere lies before them\r\nin the full blaze of light, and there is no possibility of error in\r\ndistinguishing continent from continent.\r\n\r\nThe surprise only kindled their emotion to yet keener intensity, and it\r\nwould be hard to describe the excitement with which they gazed at the\r\npanorama that was before them. The crisis of peril was close at hand,\r\nbut imagination overleaped all consideration of danger; and everything\r\nwas absorbed in the one idea that they were again within reach of that\r\ncircle of humanity from which they had supposed themselves severed\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, if they could have paused to study it, that panorama of\r\nthe states of Europe which was outstretched before their eyes, was\r\nconspicuous for the fantastic resemblances with which Nature on the one\r\nhand, and international relations on the other, have associated them.\r\nThere was England, marching like some stately dame towards the east,\r\ntrailing her ample skirts and coroneted with the cluster of her little\r\nislets; Sweden and Norway, with their bristling spine of mountains,\r\nseemed like a splendid lion eager to spring down from the bosom of the\r\nice-bound north; Russia, a gigantic polar bear, stood with its head\r\ntowards Asia, its left paw resting upon Turkey, its right upon Mount\r\nCaucasus; Austria resembled a huge cat curled up and sleeping a watchful\r\nsleep; Spain, with Portugal as a pennant, like an unfurled banner,\r\nfloated from the extremity of the continent; Turkey, like an insolent\r\ncock, appeared to clutch the shores of Asia with the one claw, and the\r\nland of Greece with the other; Italy, as it were a foot and leg encased\r\nin a tight-fitting boot, was juggling deftly with the islands of Sicily,\r\nSardinia, and Corsica; Prussia, a formidable hatchet imbedded in the\r\nheart of Germany, its edge just grazing the frontiers of France; whilst\r\nFrance itself suggested a vigorous torso with Paris at its breast.\r\n\r\nAll at once Ben Zoof breaks the silence: “Montmartre! I see Montmartre!”\r\n And, smile at the absurdity as others might, nothing could induce the\r\nworthy orderly to surrender his belief that he could actually make out\r\nthe features of his beloved home.\r\n\r\nThe only individual whose soul seemed unstirred by the approaching earth\r\nwas Palmyrin Rosette. Leaning over the side of the car, he kept his eyes\r\nfixed upon the abandoned comet, now floating about a mile and a half\r\nbelow him, bright in the general irradiation which was flooding the\r\nsurrounding space.\r\n\r\nChronometer in hand, Lieutenant Procope stood marking the minutes and\r\nseconds as they fled; and the stillness which had once again fallen upon\r\nthem all was only broken by his order to replenish the stove, that the\r\nmontgolfier might retain its necessary level. Servadac and the count\r\ncontinued to gaze upon the earth with an eagerness that almost amounted\r\nto awe. The balloon was slightly in the rear of Gallia, a circumstance\r\nthat augured somewhat favorably, because it might be presumed that if\r\nthe comet preceded the balloon in its contact with the earth, there\r\nwould be a break in the suddenness of transfer from one atmosphere to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe next question of anxiety was, where would the balloon alight? If\r\nupon _terra firma_, would it be in a place where adequate resources for\r\nsafety would be at hand? If upon the ocean, would any passing vessel be\r\nwithin hail to rescue them from their critical position? Truly, as the\r\ncount observed to his comrades, none but a Divine Pilot could steer them\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n“Forty-two minutes past!” said the lieutenant, and his voice seemed to\r\nthrill through the silence of expectation.\r\n\r\nThere were not 20,000 miles between the comet and the earth!\r\n\r\nThe calculated time of impact was 2 hours 47 minutes 35.6 seconds. Five\r\nminutes more and collision must ensue!\r\n\r\nBut was it so? Just at this moment, Lieutenant Procope observed that the\r\ncomet deviated sensibly in an oblique course. Was it possible that after\r\nall collision would not occur?\r\n\r\nThe deviation, however, was not great; it did not justify any\r\nanticipation that Gallia would merely graze the earth, as it had done\r\nbefore; it left it certain that the two bodies would inevitably impinge.\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” said Ben Zoof, “this time we shall stick together.”\r\n\r\nAnother thought occurred. Was it not only too likely that, in the fusion\r\nof the two atmospheres, the balloon itself, in which they were being\r\nconveyed, would be rent into ribbons, and every one of its passengers\r\nhurled into destruction, so that not a Gallian should survive to tell\r\nthe tale of their strange peregrinations?\r\n\r\nMoments were precious; but Hector Servadac resolved that he would adopt\r\na device to secure that at least some record of their excursion in solar\r\ndistances should survive themselves.\r\n\r\nTearing a leaf from his note-book, he wrote down the name of the comet,\r\nthe list of the fragments of the earth it had carried off, the names\r\nof his companions, and the date of the comet’s aphelion; and having\r\nsubscribed it with his signature, turned to Nina and told her he must\r\nhave the carrier-pigeon which was nestling in her bosom.\r\n\r\nThe child’s eyes filled with tears; she did not say a word, but\r\nimprinting a kiss upon its soft plumage, she surrendered it at once, and\r\nthe message was hurriedly fastened to its neck. The bird wheeled round\r\nand round in a few circles that widened in their diameter, and quickly\r\nsunk to an altitude in the comet’s atmosphere much inferior to the\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nSome minutes more were thus consumed and the interval of distance was\r\nreduced to less than 8,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe velocity became inconceivably great, but the increased rate of\r\nmotion was in no way perceptible; there was nothing to disturb the\r\nequilibrium of the car in which they were making their aerial adventure.\r\n\r\n“Forty-six minutes!” announced the lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe glowing expanse of the earth’s disc seemed like a vast funnel,\r\nyawning to receive the comet and its atmosphere, balloon and all, into\r\nits open mouth.\r\n\r\n“Forty-seven!” cried Procope.\r\n\r\nThere was half a minute yet. A thrill ran through every vein. A\r\nvibration quivered through the atmosphere. The montgolfier, elongated\r\nto its utmost stretch, was manifestly being sucked into a vortex. Every\r\npassenger in the quivering car involuntarily clung spasmodically to its\r\nsides, and as the two atmospheres amalgamated, clouds accumulated in\r\nheavy masses, involving all around in dense obscurity, while flashes of\r\nlurid flame threw a weird glimmer on the scene.\r\n\r\nIn a mystery every one found himself upon the earth again. They could\r\nnot explain it, but here they were once more upon terrestrial soil; in\r\na swoon they had left the earth, and in a similar swoon they had come\r\nback!\r\n\r\nOf the balloon not a vestige remained, and contrary to previous\r\ncomputation, the comet had merely grazed the earth, and was traversing\r\nthe regions of space, again far away!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. BACK AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n“In Algeria, captain?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ben Zoof, in Algeria; and not far from Mostaganem.” Such were the\r\nfirst words which, after their return to consciousness, were exchanged\r\nbetween Servadac and his orderly.\r\n\r\nThey had resided so long in the province that they could not for a\r\nmoment be mistaken as to their whereabouts, and although they were\r\nincapable of clearing up the mysteries that shrouded the miracle, yet\r\nthey were convinced at the first glance that they had been returned to\r\nthe earth at the very identical spot where they had quitted it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they were scarcely more than a mile from Mostaganem, and in\r\nthe course of an hour, when they had all recovered from the bewilderment\r\noccasioned by the shock, they started off in a body and made their way\r\nto the town. It was a matter of extreme surprise to find no symptom of\r\nthe least excitement anywhere as they went along. The population was\r\nperfectly calm; every one was pursuing his ordinary avocation; the\r\ncattle were browsing quietly upon the pastures that were moist with the\r\ndew of an ordinary January morning. It was about eight o’clock; the sun\r\nwas rising in the east; nothing could be noticed to indicate that\r\nany abnormal incident had either transpired or been expected by the\r\ninhabitants. As to a collision with a comet, there was not the faintest\r\ntrace of any such phenomenon crossing men’s minds, and awakening, as\r\nit surely would, a panic little short of the certified approach of the\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n“Nobody expects us,” said Servadac; “that is very certain.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” answered Ben Zoof, with a sigh; he was manifestly\r\ndisappointed that his return to Mostaganem was not welcomed with a\r\ntriumphal reception.\r\n\r\nThey reached the Mascara gate. The first persons that Servadac\r\nrecognized were the two friends that he had invited to be his seconds in\r\nthe duel two years ago, the colonel of the 2nd Fusiliers and the captain\r\nof the 8th Artillery. In return to his somewhat hesitating salutation,\r\nthe colonel greeted him heartily, “Ah! Servadac, old fellow! is it you?”\r\n\r\n“I, myself,” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“Where on earth have you been to all this time? In the name of peace,\r\nwhat have you been doing with yourself?”\r\n\r\n“You would never believe me, colonel,” answered Servadac, “if I were to\r\ntell you; so on that point I had better hold my tongue.”\r\n\r\n“Hang your mysteries!” said the colonel; “tell me, where have you been?”\r\n\r\n“No, my friend, excuse me,” replied Servadac; “but shake hands with me\r\nin earnest, that I may be sure I am not dreaming.” Hector Servadac\r\nhad made up his mind, and no amount of persuasion could induce him to\r\ndivulge his incredible experiences.\r\n\r\nAnxious to turn the subject, Servadac took the earliest opportunity of\r\nasking, “And what about Madame de L----?”\r\n\r\n“Madame de L-----!” exclaimed the colonel, taking the words out of his\r\nmouth; “the lady is married long ago; you did not suppose that she was\r\ngoing to wait for you. ‘Out of sight, out of mind,’ you know.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Servadac; and turning to the count he said, “Do you hear\r\nthat? We shall not have to fight our duel after all.”\r\n\r\n“Most happy to be excused,” rejoined the count. The rivals took each\r\nother by the hand, and were united henceforth in the bonds of a sincere\r\nand confiding friendship.\r\n\r\n“An immense relief,” said Servadac to himself, “that I have no occasion\r\nto finish that confounded rondo!”\r\n\r\nIt was agreed between the captain and the count that it would be\r\ndesirable in every way to maintain the most rigid silence upon the\r\nsubject of the inexplicable phenomena which had come within their\r\nexperience. It was to them both a subject of the greatest perplexity to\r\nfind that the shores of the Mediterranean had undergone no change,\r\nbut they coincided in the opinion that it was prudent to keep their\r\nbewilderment entirely to themselves. Nothing induced them to break their\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nThe very next day the small community was broken up.\r\n\r\nThe _Dobryna’s_ crew, with the count and the lieutenant, started for\r\nRussia, and the Spaniards, provided, by the count’s liberality, with a\r\ncompetency that ensured them from want, were despatched to their native\r\nshores. The leave taking was accompanied by genuine tokens of regard and\r\ngoodwill.\r\n\r\nFor Isaac Hakkabut alone there was no feeling of regret. Doubly ruined\r\nby the loss of his tartan, and by the abandonment of his fortune, he\r\ndisappeared entirely from the scene. It is needless to say that no\r\none troubled himself to institute a search after him, and, as Ben Zoof\r\nsententiously remarked, “Perhaps old Jehoram is making money in America\r\nby exhibiting himself as the latest arrival from a comet!”\r\n\r\nBut however great was the reserve which Captain Servadac might make\r\non his part, nothing could induce Professor Rosette to conceal his\r\nexperiences. In spite of the denial which astronomer after astronomer\r\ngave to the appearance of such a comet as Gallia at all, and of its\r\nbeing refused admission to the catalogue, he published a voluminous\r\ntreatise, not only detailing his own adventures, but setting forth, with\r\nthe most elaborate precision, all the elements which settled its period\r\nand its orbit. Discussions arose in scientific circles; an overwhelming\r\nmajority decided against the representations of the professor; an\r\nunimportant minority declared themselves in his favor, and a pamphlet\r\nobtained some degree of notice, ridiculing the whole debate under the\r\ntitle of “The History of an Hypothesis.” In reply to this impertinent\r\ncriticism of his labors, Rosette issued a rejoinder full with the most\r\nvehement expressions of indignation, and reiterating his asseveration\r\nthat a fragment of Gibraltar was still traversing the regions of space,\r\ncarrying thirteen Englishmen upon its surface, and concluding by saying\r\nthat it was the great disappointment of his life that he had not been\r\ntaken with them.\r\n\r\nPablo and little Nina were adopted, the one by Servadac, the other\r\nby the count, and under the supervision of their guardians, were well\r\neducated and cared for. Some years later, Colonel, no longer Captain,\r\nServadac, his hair slightly streaked with grey, had the pleasure of\r\nseeing the handsome young Spaniard united in marriage to the Italian,\r\nnow grown into a charming girl, upon whom the count bestowed an ample\r\ndowry; the young people’s happiness in no way marred by the fact that\r\nthey had not been destined, as once seemed likely, to be the Adam and\r\nEve of a new world.\r\n\r\nThe career of the comet was ever a mystery which neither Servadac nor\r\nhis orderly could eliminate from the regions of doubt. Anyhow, they were\r\nfirmer and more confiding friends than ever.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the environs of Montmartre, where they were secure from\r\neavesdroppers, Ben Zoof incidentally referred to the experiences in\r\nthe depths of Nina’s Hive; but stopped short and said, “However, those\r\nthings never happened, sir, did they?”\r\n\r\nHis master could only reply, “Confound it, Ben Zoof! What is a man to\r\nbelieve?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I have omitted the designation “V. IX.
