The sphere rested on the primeval muck and\r\nslime at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, one mile beneath the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe beam from his 200-watt searchlight, which shot out through one of\r\nhis three windows into the dark blue depths beyond, seemed faint\r\nindeed, yet it served to illuminate anything which crossed it, or on\r\nwhich it fell.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable length of time since his descent to the ocean\r\nfloor, young Abbot had clung to one of the thick windows of his\r\nbathysphere, absorbed by the marine life outside. Slender small fish\r\nwith stereoscopic eyes, darted in and out of the beam of light.\r\nSwimming snails floated by, carrying their own phosphorescent\r\nlanterns. Paper-thin transparent crustaceans swam into view, followed\r\nby a few white shrimps, pale as ghosts. Then a mist of tiny fish swept\r\nacross his field of vision. Abbot cupped his face in his hands, and\r\nstared out.\r\n\r\nThe incongruous thought flashed across his mind that thus he had often\r\nsat by the window of his club in New York, and gazed out at the\r\npassing motor traffic.\r\n\r\nHis searchlight cut a sharp swath through the blue muck. More than\r\nonce he thought he saw large moving fish-like forms far away.\r\n\r\n\"Speed up the generator,\" he called into his phone.\r\n\r\nImmediately the shaft of light brightened. He set about trying to\r\nfocus upon one of those dim elusive shapes which had so intrigued him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the searchlight went out! Intent on repairing the\r\napparatus as rapidly as possible, Abbot snapped the button-switch,\r\nwhich ought to have illuminated the interior of his diving-sphere; but\r\nthe lights did not go on. Then he noticed that the electric fan, on\r\nwhich he depended to keep his air-supply properly mixed, had stopped.\r\n\r\nHe spoke into the telephone transmitter, which hung in front of his\r\nmouth: \"Hi, there, up on the boat! My electric power is cut off. I'm\r\ndown here with my fan stopped and my heat cut off. Hoist me up, and be\r\nquick about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K., sir.\"\r\n\r\nAs the young man waited for the winch to get under way on the boat a\r\nmile above him, he pulled out his electric pocket flashlight and sent\r\nits feeble ray out through his quartz-glass window into the dim\r\nroyal-purple depths beyond, in one last attempt to get a look at those\r\nmysterious fish-shapes which had so intrigued him.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw one of them distinctly.\r\n\r\nEvidently they had swum closer when the glow of his searchlight had\r\nstopped; and so the sudden flash of his pocket-light had taken them by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nFor, as he snapped it on, he caught an instant's glimpse of a grinning\r\nfish-face pressed close against the outside of his thick window-pane,\r\nas though trying to peer in at him. The fish-face somewhat resembled\r\nthe head of a shark, except that the mouth was a bit smaller and not\r\nquite so leeringly brutal, and the forehead was rather high and domed.\r\n\r\nBut what most attracted Abbot's attention, in the brief instant before\r\nthe startled fish whisked away in a swirl of phosphorescent foam, was\r\nthe fact that, from beneath each of the two pectoral fins, there\r\nprotruded what appeared to be a skinny human arm, terminating in three\r\nfingers and a thumb!\r\n\r\nThen the fish was gone. Abbot snapped off his little light.\r\n\r\nThe diving-sphere quivered, as the hoisting-cable tautened. But\r\nsuddenly the sphere settled back to the bottom of the sea with a\r\njarring thud. \"Cable's parted, sir!\" spoke a frantic voice in his\r\near-phones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment George Abbot sat stunned with horror. Then his mind began\r\nto race, like a squirrel in a cage, seeking some way of escape.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he could manage to unscrew the 400-pound trap door at the top\r\nof the sphere, and shoot to the surface, with the bubbling-out of the\r\nconfined air. But his scientifically trained mind made some rapid\r\ncalculations which showed him this was absurd.\r\n\r\nAt the depth of a mile, the pressure is roughly 156 atmospheres, that\r\nis to say, 156 times the air-pressure at the surface of the earth; and\r\nthe moment that his sphere was opened to this pressure, he would be\r\nblown back inwardly away from the man-hole, and the air inside his\r\nsphere would suddenly be compressed to only 1/156 of its former\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nNot only would this pressure be sufficient to squash him into a\r\nmangled pulp, but also the sudden compression of the air inside the\r\nsphere would generate enough heat to fry that mangled pulp to a crisp\r\ncinder almost instantly.\r\n\r\nAs George Abbot came to a full realization of the horror of these\r\nfacts, he recoiled from the trap-door as though it were charged with\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sakes, do something!\" he shrieked in agony into the\r\ntransmitter.\r\n\r\n\"Courage, sir,\" came back the reply. \"We are rigging up a grapple just\r\nas fast as we can. Long before your oxygen gives out, we shall slide\r\nit down to you along the telephone line, which is the only remaining\r\nconnection between us. When it settles about your sphere, and you can\r\nsee its hooks outside your window by the light of your pocket-flash,\r\nlet us know, and we'll trip the grapple and haul you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" replied the young man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was calm now, but it was an enforced and numb kind of calmness.\r\nMechanically he throttled down his oxygen supply, so as to make it\r\nlast longer. Mechanically he took out his notebook and pencil and\r\nstarted to write down, in the dark, his experiences; for he was\r\ndetermined to leave a full account for posterity, even though he\r\nhimself should perish.\r\n\r\nAfter setting down a categorical description of the successive\r\npartings of the electric light cable and the hoist cable, and his\r\nthoughts and feelings in that connection, he described in detail the\r\nshark with hands, which he had seen through the window of his sphere.\r\nHe tried to be very explicit about this, for he realized that his\r\naccount would probably be laid, by everyone, to the disordered\r\nimagination of his last dying moments; being a true scientist, George\r\nAbbot wanted the world to believe him, so that another sphere would be\r\nbuilt and sent down to the ocean depths, to find out more about these\r\npeculiar denizens of the deep.\r\n\r\nOf course, no one would believe him. This thought kept drumming in his\r\nears. No one--except Professor Osborne. Old Osborne would believe!\r\n\r\nGeorge Abbot's mind flashed back to a conversation he had had with the\r\nold professor, just before the oil interests had sent him on this\r\nexploring trip to discover the source of the large quantities of\r\npetroleum which had begun to bubble up from the bottom of a certain\r\nsection of the Pacific very near where Abbot now was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOsborne had said, \"This petroleum suggests a gusher to me. And what\r\ncauses gushers? Human beings, boring for oil, to satisfy human needs.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Professor,\" Abbot had objected, \"there can't be any human beings\r\nat the bottom of the sea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Professor Osborne had countered. \"Life is supposed to have\r\noriginated spontaneously in the slime of the ocean depths; therefore\r\nthat part of the earth has had a head-start on us in the game of\r\nevolution. May not this head-start have been maintained right down to\r\ndate, thus producing at the bottom of the sea a race superior to\r\nanything upon the dry land?\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" Abbot had objected further, \"if so, why haven't they come up to\r\nvisit or conquer us? And why haven't we ever found any trace of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite simple to explain,\" the old professor had replied. \"Any\r\ncreature who can live at the frightful pressures of the ocean depths\r\ncould never survive a journey even halfway to the surface. It would be\r\nlike our trying to live in an almost perfect vacuum. We should\r\nexplode, and so would these denizens of the deep, if they tried to\r\ncome up here. Even one of their dead bodies could not be brought to\r\nthe surface in recognizable form. No contact with them will ever be\r\npossible, nor will they ever constitute a menace to any one--for which\r\nwe may thank the Lord!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Abbot now reviewed this conversation as he crouched in his\r\ndiving-sphere in the purple darkness of the marine depths. Yes, old\r\nOsborne would believe him. The diary must be written for Osborne's\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbbot sent another beam from his pocket light suddenly out into the\r\nwater; and this time he surprised several of the peculiar fish. These,\r\nlike the first, had arms and hands and high intelligent foreheads.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Abbot laughed a harsh laugh. Old Osborne had been wrong\r\nin one thing, namely in saying that the super-race of the deep would\r\nnever be a menace to anyone. They were being a menace to George Abbot,\r\nright now, for it was undoubtedly they who had cut his cables.\r\nProbably they were possessed of much the same scientific curiosity\r\nwith regard to him as he was with regard to them, and so they had\r\ndetermined to secure him as a museum specimen.\r\n\r\nThe idea was a weird one. He laughed again, mirthlessly.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, sir?\" came an anxious voice in his ear-phones.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry that grapple!\" was his reply. \"I have found out what cut my\r\ncables. There are some very intelligent-looking fish down here, and I\r\nthink they want me for--\"\r\n\r\nAn ominous click sounded in his ears. Then silence.\r\n\r\n\"Hello! Hello there!\" he shouted. \"Can you hear me up on the boat?\"\r\n\r\nBut no answer came back. The line remained dead. The strange fish had\r\ncut George Abbot's last contact with the upper world. The\r\ngrapple-hooks could never find him now, for there was now not even a\r\ntelephone cable to guide them down to his sphere.\r\n\r\nThe realization that he was hopelessly lost, and that he had not much\r\nlonger to live, came as a real relief to him, after the last few\r\nmoments of frantic uncertainty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHoping that his sphere would eventually be found, even though too late\r\nto do him any good, he set assiduously to work jotting down all the\r\ndetails which he could remember of those strange denizens of the deep,\r\nthe man-handed sharks, which he was now firmly convinced were the\r\ncause of his present predicament.\r\n\r\nHe stared out through one of his windows into the brilliant blue\r\ndarkness, but did not turn on his flashlight. How near were these\r\nenemies of his, he wondered?\r\n\r\nThe presence of those menacing man-sharks, just outside the\r\nfour-inch-thick steel shell, which withstood a ton of pressure for\r\neach square inch of its surface, began to obsess young Abbot. What\r\nwere they doing out there in the watery-blue midnight? Perhaps, having\r\nsecured his sphere as a scientific specimen, they were already\r\npreparing to cut into it so as to see what was inside. That these\r\nfish could cut through four inches of steel was not so improbable as\r\nit sounded, for had they not already succeeded in severing a rubber\r\ncable an inch and a half thick, containing two heavy copper wires, and\r\nalso two inches of the finest, non-kinking steel rope!\r\n\r\nThe young scientist flashed his pocket torch out through the thick\r\nquartz pane, but his enemies were nowhere in sight. Then he fell to\r\ncalculating his oxygen supply. His normal consumption was about half a\r\nquart per minute, at which rate his two tanks would be good for\r\nthirty-six hours. His chemical racks contained enough soda-lime to\r\nabsorb the excess carbon dioxide, enough calcium chloride to keep down\r\nthe humidity and enough charcoal to sweeten the body odors for much\r\nmore than that period.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, the thought of these facts encouraged him. He had been\r\ndown less than two hours. Perhaps the boat above him could affect his\r\nrescue in the more than thirty-four hours which remained!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut then he realized that he had failed to take into consideration the\r\nnear-freezing temperature of the ocean depths. This temperature he\r\nknew to be in the neighborhood of 39 degrees Fahrenheit--even though\r\nno thermometer hung outside his window, as none could withstand the\r\nfrightful pressures at the bottom of the sea. For it is one of the\r\nremarkable facts of inductive science that man has been able to figure\r\nout _a priori_ that the temperature at all deep points of the ocean,\r\ntropic as well as arctic, must always be stable at approximately 39\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nAbbot was clad only in a light cotton sailor suit, and now that his\r\nsource of heat had been cut off by the severing of his power lines,\r\nhis prison was rapidly becoming unbearably chilly. His thick steel\r\nsphere constituted such a perfect transmitter of heat that he might\r\nalmost as well have been actually swimming in water of 39 degrees\r\ntemperature, so far as comfort was concerned.\r\n\r\nAbbot's emotions ran all the gamut from stupefaction, through dull\r\ncalmness, clear-headed thought, intense but aimless mental activity,\r\nnervousness, frenzy, and insane delirium, back to stupefaction again.\r\n\r\nDuring one of his periods of calmness, he figured out what an almost\r\ntotal impossibility there was of the chance that his ship, one mile\r\nabove him on the surface, could ever find his sphere with grappling\r\nhooks. Yet he prayed for that chance. A single chance in a million\r\nsometimes does happen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral hours had by now elapsed since the parting of the young\r\nscientist's cables. It was bitterly cold inside the sphere. In order\r\nto keep warm, he had to exercise during his calm moments as\r\nsystematically as his cramped quarters would permit. During his\r\nfrantic moments he got plenty of exercise automatically. And of course\r\nall this movement used up more than the normal amount of oxygen, so\r\nthat he was forced to open the valves on his tanks to two or three\r\ntimes their normal flow. His span of further life was thereby cut to\r\nten or twelve hours, if indeed he could keep himself warm for that\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nWhy didn't the people on the boat do something!\r\n\r\nHe was just about to indulge in one of his frantic fits of despair,\r\nwhen he heard or felt--the two senses being strangely commingled in\r\nhis present situation--a clank or thump upon the top of his\r\nbathysphere. Instantly hope flooded him. Could it be that the one\r\nchance in a million had actually happened, and that a grapple from the\r\nboat above had actually found him?\r\n\r\nWith feverish expectation, he pressed the button of his little\r\nelectric pocket flashlight, and sent its feeble beam out through one\r\nof the quartz-glass windows into the blue-black depths beyond.\r\n\r\nNo hooks in front of this window. He tried the others. No hooks there,\r\neither. But he did see plenty of the superhuman fish. Eighteen of\r\nthem, he counted, in sight at one time. And also two huge snake-like\r\ncreatures with crested backs and maned heads, veritable sea-serpents.\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing the young man could do to assist in the grappling\r\nof his sphere by his friends in the boat above, he devoted his time to\r\njotting down a detailed description of these two new beasts and of\r\ntheir behavior.\r\n\r\nOne of the sharks appeared to be leading or driving them up to the\r\nbathysphere; and when they got close enough, Abbot was surprised to\r\nsee that they wore what appeared to be a harness!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe clanking upon the bathysphere continued, and now the young man\r\nlearned its cause. It was not the grapple hooks from his ship, but\r\nchains--chains which the man-armed sharks were wrapping around the\r\nbathysphere.\r\n\r\nTwo more of the harnessed sea-serpents swam into view, and these two\r\nwere hitched to a flat cart: an actual cart with wheels. The chains\r\nwere attached to the harness of the original two beasts; they swam\r\nupward and disappeared from view; and the sphere slowly rose from the\r\nmucky bottom of the sea, to be lowered again squarely on top of the\r\ncart. The cart jerked forward, and a journey over the ocean floor\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nThen the little pocket torch dimmed to a dull red glow, and the scene\r\noutside faded gradually from view. Abbot switched off the now useless\r\nlight and set to work with scientific precision to record all these\r\nunbelievable events.\r\n\r\nIn his interest and excitement, he had forgotten the ever-increasing\r\ncold; but gradually, as he wrote, the frigidity of his surroundings\r\nwas forced on his consciousness. He turned on more oxygen, and\r\nexercised frantically. Meanwhile the cart, carrying his bathysphere,\r\nbumped along over an uneven road.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, he tried his almost exhausted little light, but its\r\ndim red beam was completely absorbed by the blue of the ocean depths,\r\nand he could make out nothing except two bulking indistinct shapes,\r\nwrithing on ahead of him. Finally even this degree of visibility\r\nfailed, and he could see absolutely nothing outside.\r\n\r\nHe was now so chilled and numb that he could no longer write. With a\r\nlast effort, he noted down that fact, and then put the book away in\r\nits rack.\r\n\r\nHe began to feel drowsy. Rousing himself, he turned on more oxygen.\r\nThe effect was exhilaration and a feeling of silly joy. He began to\r\nbabble drunkenly to himself. His head swam. His mind was in a daze.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seemed hours later when he awoke. Ahead of him in the distance\r\nthere was a dim pale-blue light, against which there could be seen, in\r\nsilhouette, the forms of the two serpentine steeds and their fish-like\r\ndrivers. Abbot's hands and feet were completely numb, but his head was\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer to the light, it gradually took form, until it\r\nturned out to be the mouth of a cave. The cart entered it.\r\n\r\nDown a long tunnel they progressed, the light getting brighter and\r\nbrighter as they advanced. The color of the light became a golden\r\ngreen. The rough stone walls of the tunnel could now be seen; and\r\nfinally there appeared, ahead, two semicircular doors, swung back\r\nagainst the sides of the passage.\r\n\r\nBeyond these doors, the tunnel walls were smooth and exactly\r\ncylindrical, and on the ceiling there were many luminous tubes, which\r\nlit up the place as brightly as daylight. The cart came to a stop.\r\n\r\nThe young scientist could now see with surprising distinctness his\r\ncaptors and their serpentine steeds, and even the details of the\r\nchains and the harness. He tried to pick up his diary, so as to jot\r\ndown some points which he had theretofore missed; but his hands were\r\ntoo numb. But at least he could keep on observing; so he glued his\r\neyes to the thick quartz window-pane once more.\r\n\r\nA short distance ahead in the passage there was another pair of doors.\r\nPresently these swung open and the cavalcade moved forward. Five or\r\nsix successive pairs of doors were passed in this manner, and then the\r\nsea-serpents began to thrash about and become almost unmanageable. It\r\nwas evident that some change not to their liking had taken place in\r\ntheir surroundings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last, as one of the portals swung open, young Abbot saw what\r\nappeared to be four deep-sea diving-suits. Could these suits contain\r\nhuman beings? And if so, who? It seemed incredible, for no diving-suit\r\nhad ever been devised in which a man could descend to the depth of one\r\nmile, and live.\r\n\r\nThese four figures, whatever they were, came stolidly forward and took\r\ncharge of the cart. One of the sharks swam up to them and appeared to\r\ntalk to them with its hands. Then the sharks unhitched the two\r\nsea-serpents and led them to the rear, and Abbot saw them no more.\r\n\r\nThe four divers picked up the chains, and slowly towed the cart\r\nforward, their clumsy, ponderous movements contrasting markedly with\r\nthe swift and sure swishings which had characterized the man-sharks\r\nand their snake-like steeds.\r\n\r\nSeveral more pairs of doors were passed, and then there met them four\r\nfigures in less cumbersome diving-suits, like those ordinarily used by\r\nmen just below the surface of the sea. One of the deep-sea divers then\r\npressed his face close to the outside of one of the windows of the\r\nbathysphere, as though to take a look inside; but the four newcomers\r\nwaved him away, and hurriedly picked up the chains. Nevertheless, in\r\nthat brief instant, Abbot had seen within the head-piece of the diver\r\nwhat appeared to be a bearded human face.\r\n\r\nSeveral more pairs of doors were passed. The four deep-sea divers\r\nfloundered along beside the cart, quite evidently having more and more\r\ndifficulty of locomotion as each successive doorway was passed, until\r\nfinally they lay down and were left behind.\r\n\r\nAt last the procession entered a section of tunnel which was square,\r\ninstead of circular, and in which there was a wide shelf along one\r\nside about three feet above the floor. The four divers then dropped\r\nthe chains, and one by one took a look at Abbot through his window.\r\n\r\nAnd he at the same time took a most interested look at them.\r\n\r\nThey had unmistakable human faces!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe must be dreaming! For even if Osborne was right about his supposed\r\nsuper-race at the bottom of the sea, this race could not be human, for\r\nthe pressures here would be entirely too great. No human being could\r\npossibly stand two thousand pounds per square inch!\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied their curiosity, the four divers pulled themselves up\r\nonto the shelf, and sat there in a row with their legs hanging over.\r\n\r\nAbbot glanced upward at the ceiling lights, but these had become\r\nstrangely blurred. There seemed to be an opaque barrier above him, and\r\nthis barrier seemed to be slowly descending. The lights blurred out\r\ncompletely, and were replaced by a diffused illumination over the\r\nentire ripply barrier. And then it dawned on the young man that this\r\ndescending sheet of silver was the surface of the water. He was in a\r\nlock, and the water was being pumped out.\r\n\r\nThe surface settled about the helmets of the divers, and their helmets\r\ndisappeared; then their shoulders and the rest of them. At last it\r\nreached the level of Abbot's window. The divers could again be seen,\r\nand among then on the shelf there stood a half dozen naked bearded\r\nmen, clad only in loin-cloths. They had evidently entered the lock\r\nwhile the water was subsiding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese men unbuckled the helmets of the divers and helped them out, and\r\nthen splashed down into the water and peered in through the windows of\r\nthe bathysphere. Presently some of them left through a door at the end\r\nof the platform, but soon reappeared with staging, which they set up\r\naround the sphere. Then, climbing on top, they got to work on the\r\nman-hole cover.\r\n\r\nAs George Abbot realized their purpose, he became frantic. Although\r\nthese men appeared to be human, just like himself, yet his\r\nscientifically-trained mind told him that they must be of some very\r\nspecial anatomical structure, in order to be able to withstand the\r\nimmense pressures at the bottom of the Pacific. It was all right for\r\nthem to be out there, but it would be fatal to him!\r\n\r\nAnd then the heavy circular door above him began slowly to revolve.\r\n\r\nThis was terrible! In a moment the crushing pressures of the depths\r\nwould come seeping in. Rising unsteadily upon his knees, the young man\r\ntried with his fingers to resist the rotation of the door; but it\r\ncontinued to turn.\r\n\r\nYet no pressure could be felt. The door became completely unscrewed.\r\nIt was pried up, and slid off the top of the bathysphere, to crash\r\nupon the floor outside. Inquisitive bearded faces peered down through\r\nthe hole.\r\n\r\nYoung Abbot slumped to the cold bottom of the sphere and stared back\r\nat them. He was saved; incredibly saved! These were real people, the\r\nair was real air and he must therefore be on the surface of the earth,\r\ninstead of at the bottom of the Pacific as he had imagined! With a\r\nsigh of relief, he fainted....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he came to his senses again, he was lying in a bed in a small\r\nroom. Bending over him was the sweetest feminine face that he had ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed to be about twenty years of age. She was clad in a\r\nclinging robe of some filmy green substance. Her hair was honey-brown,\r\nshort and curly, and her forehead high and intelligent. Her eyes, an\r\nindescribable shade of deep violet, were matchlessly set off by her\r\nivory skin.\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled up at her, and she smiled back. Thus far it had\r\nnot occurred to him to wonder where he was, or why. No recollection of\r\nhis recent strange adventures came to him. To him this was an exotic\r\ndream, from which he did not care to awake.\r\n\r\nShe spoke. Her words were unintelligible, and unlike any language\r\nwhich George Abbot knew or had even heard; and he was an accomplished\r\nlinguist in addition to his other attainments.\r\n\r\nAnd her words were not all that was strange about her speech, for the\r\nvery tones of her voice sounded completely unhuman, although not\r\ndispleasing. Her talk had a metallic ring to it, like the brassy blare\r\nof temple gongs, and yet was so smooth and subdued as to be sweeter\r\nthan any sound that the young scientist had ever heard before.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful dream fairy,\" replied the enraptured young man, \"I haven't\r\nthe slightest idea what you are saying, but keep right on. I like it.\"\r\n\r\nHis own voice sounded crass and crude compared to hers. At his first\r\nwords she gave a start of surprise, but thereafter the sound did not\r\nappear to grate on her ears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen one of the bearded men in loin-cloths entered, and he and the\r\ngirl talked together, quite evidently about their patient. The man's\r\nvoice had the same strange metallic quality to it as that of the girl,\r\nbut was deeper, so that it boomed with the rich notes of a bell.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the man, young Abbot's memory swept back, and he\r\nremembered the adventure of his diving-sphere, and its capture, one\r\nmile down, by the strange shark-fish with human hands and arms. But\r\nhow he had reached the surface of the earth again, he couldn't figure\r\nout. Nor did he particularly care.\r\n\r\nThe strange man withdrew, and the girl sat down beside the bed and\r\nsmiled at Abbot. He smiled back at her.\r\n\r\nPresently another girl entered and called, \"Milli!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl beside the bed started, and looking up asked some question,\r\nto which the other replied.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer brought in some strange warm food in a covered dish and\r\nthen withdrew. The first girl proceeded to feed her patient.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, which tasted unlike anything which the young man had\r\never eaten before, the beautiful nurse again essayed conversation with\r\nhim. She seemed perplexed and a bit frightened that he could not\r\nunderstand her words. Somehow, the young man sensed that this girl had\r\nnever heard any other language than her own, and that she did not even\r\nknow that other languages existed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrengthened by his food, he determined to set about learning her\r\nlanguage as soon as possible. So he pointed at her and asked, \"Milli?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, and spoke some word which he took for \"yes.\"\r\n\r\nThen he pointed to himself and said, \"George.\"\r\n\r\nShe understood, but the word was a difficult one for her to duplicate\r\nin the metallic tongue of her people. She made several attempts, until\r\nhe laughingly spoke her word for \"yes.\"\r\n\r\nThen he pointed to other objects about the room. She gave him the\r\nnames of these, but he could easily see that she felt that, if he did\r\nnot know the names for all these common things, there must be\r\nsomething the matter with him.\r\n\r\nHe wondered how he could make her understand that there were other\r\nlanguages in the world than her own; and then he remembered the sharks\r\nwith their hands and what he had taken to be their sign language.\r\nPerhaps Milli at least knew of the existence of the sign language.\r\nThis would afford a parallel; for if she realized that there were two\r\nlanguages in the world, might there not be three?\r\n\r\nSo Abbot made some meaningless signs with his fingers. Milli quite\r\nevidently was accustomed to this kind of talk, but she was further\r\nperplexed to find that George talked gibberish with his hands as well\r\nas with his mouth.\r\n\r\nShe made some signs with her hands, and then said something orally.\r\nYoung Abbot instantly pointed to her mouth, and held up one finger;\r\nthen to her hands, and held up two; then to his own mouth, and held up\r\nthree, at the same time speaking a sentence of English. Instantly she\r\ncaught on: there were three languages in the world. And thereafter she\r\nno longer regarded him as crazy.\r\n\r\nFor several hours she taught him. Then another meal was brought, after\r\nwhich she left him, and the lights went out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe awakened feeling thoroughly rested and well. The lights were on and\r\nMilli was beside him.\r\n\r\nHe asked for his clothes. They were brought. Milli withdrew and he put\r\nthem on.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, which they ate together, one of the bearded men came\r\nand led him out through a number of winding corridors into a larger\r\nroom, in which there was a closed spherical glass tank, about ten feet\r\nin diameter, containing one of the human sharks. Around the tank stood\r\nfive of the bearded men.\r\n\r\nOne of them proceeded to address Abbot, but of course the young\r\nAmerican could not make out what he was saying. This apparent lack of\r\nintelligence seemed to exasperate the man; and finally he turned\r\ntoward the tank, and engaged in a sign language conference with the\r\nfish; then turned back to Abbot again and spoke to him very sternly.\r\n\r\nBut Abbot shook his head and replied, \"Milli. Bring Milli.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the other men flashed a look of triumph at their leader, and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he added, \"bring Milli.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader scowled at him, and some words were interchanged, but it\r\nended in Milli being sent for. She apparently explained the situation\r\nto the satisfaction of the fish, to the intense glee of the man who\r\nhad sent for her, and to the rather complete discomfiture of the\r\nleader of the five.\r\n\r\nAbbot later learned that the leader's name was Thig, and that the name\r\nof the gleeful man was Dolf.\r\n\r\nThe reception over, Milli led Abbot back to his room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere ensued many days--very pleasant days--of language instruction\r\nfrom Milli. Dolf and Thig and others of the five came frequently, to\r\nnote his progress and to talk with him and ask him questions.\r\n\r\nA sitting room was provided for him, adjoining his sleeping quarters.\r\nMilli occupied quarters nearby.\r\n\r\nWithin a week he had mastered enough of the language of these people,\r\nfor their strange history began to be intelligible to him.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the air here was at merely atmospheric\r\npressure, nevertheless this place was one mile beneath the surface of\r\nthe Pacific. Milli and her people lived in a city hollowed out of a\r\nreef of rocks, reinforced against the terrific weight of the water and\r\nfilled with laboratory-made air. They had never been to the surface of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe fish with the human arms were their creators and their masters.\r\n\r\nProfessor Osborne had been right. The fish of the deep, having a head\r\nstart on the rest of the world, had evolved to a perfectly\r\nunbelievable degree of intelligence. Centuries ago they had built for\r\nthemselves the exact analog of George Abbot's bathysphere, and in it\r\nthey had made much the same sort of exploring trips to the surface\r\nthat he had made down into the deeps. But their spheres had been\r\nconstructed to keep in, rather than to keep out, great pressure.\r\n\r\nTheir scientists had gathered a wealth of data as to conditions on the\r\nsurface, and had even seen and studied human beings. But their\r\ninsatiable scientific curiosity had led them to want to know more\r\nabout the strange country above them and the strange persons who\r\ninhabited it. And so they set about breeding, in their own\r\nlaboratories, creatures which should be as like as possible to those\r\nwhom they had observed on the surface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course, this experiment necessitated their first setting up an\r\nair-filled partial vacuum similar to that which surrounds the earth.\r\nBut they had persisted. They had brought down samples of air from the\r\nsurface of the sea, and had analyzed and duplicated it on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nFinally, through long years, they had so directed--and controlled the\r\ncourse of evolution, in their breederies, as first to be able to\r\nproduce creatures which could live in air at low pressures, and then\r\nto evolve the descendants of those creatures into intelligent human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nSome of the lower types of this evolutionary process, both in the\r\ndirect line of descent of man, and among the collateral offshoots, had\r\nbeen retained for food and other purposes. Abbot, with intense\r\nscientific interest, studied these specimens in the zoo of the\r\nunderwater city where he was staying.\r\n\r\nPlans had been in progress for some time, among the fish-folk and\r\ntheir human subjects, to send an expedition to the surface. And now\r\nthe shark masters had fortunately been able to secure alive an actual\r\nspecimen of the surface folk--namely, George Abbot. The expedition was\r\naccordingly postponed until they could pump out of the young scientist\r\nall the information possible.\r\n\r\nAbbot was naturally overjoyed at the prospect. This would not only get\r\nhim out of here--but think what it would mean to science!\r\n\r\nThe plans of the sharks were entirely peaceful. Furthermore there were\r\nonly about two hundred of their laboratory-bred synthetic human\r\nbeings, and so these could constitute no menace to mankind.\r\nAccordingly he enthusiastically assured them that they could depend\r\nupon the hearty cooperation of the scientists of the outer earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring all his stay so far in this cave city, Abbot had been permitted\r\nto come in contact only with Milli, the members of the Committee of\r\nFive, and an occasional guard or laboratory assistant. Yet, in spite\r\nof the absence of personal contacts with other members of this strange\r\nrace, Abbot was constantly aware of a background of many people and\r\ntense activity, which kept the wheels of industry and domestic economy\r\nturning in this undersea city.\r\n\r\nAlthough the young man readily accustomed himself to the speech and\r\nfood and customs of this strange race, his personal modesty and\r\nneatness revolted at the loin-cloths and beards of the men; and so, by\r\nspecial dispensation, he was permitted to wear his sailor suit and to\r\nshave.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Five, who constituted a sort of ruling body for the\r\ncity, interviewed him at length, cross-examined him most skilfully and\r\ntook copious notes. But there seemed to be a strange lack of common\r\nmeeting ground between their minds and his, so that very often they\r\nwere forced to call on Milli to act as an intermediary. The beautiful\r\nyoung girl seemed able to understand both George Abbot and the leaders\r\nof her own people with equal facility.\r\n\r\nA number of specially constructed submarines had already been built to\r\ncarry the expedition to the surface. Before it came time to use them,\r\nAbbot tried to paint as glowing a picture as possible of life on\r\nearth; but he found it necessary to gloss over a great many things.\r\nHow could he explain and justify war, liquor, crime, poverty, graft,\r\nand the other evils to which constant acquaintance has rendered the\r\nhuman race so calloused?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was unable to deceive the men of the deep. With their\r\nsuper-intelligence, they relentlessly unearthed from him all the\r\nsalient facts. And, as a result of their discoveries, their initial\r\nfriendly feeling for the world of men rapidly developed into supreme\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nBut Abbot on the other hand developed a deep respect for them. Their\r\nchemistry and their electrical and mechanical devices amazed and\r\nastounded him. They even were able to keep sun-time and tell the\r\nseasons, by means of gyroscopes!\r\n\r\nAge was measured much as it is on the surface. This fact was brought\r\nto Abbot's attention by the approach of Milli's twentieth birthday.\r\n\r\nStrange to relate, she seemed to dread the approach of that\r\nanniversary, and finally told Abbot the reason.\r\n\r\n\"It is the custom,\" said she, \"when a girl or a boy reaches twenty, to\r\ngive a very rigorous intelligence test. In fact, such a test is given\r\non every birthday, but the one on the twentieth is the hardest. So\r\nfar, I have just barely passed each test, which fact marks me as of\r\nvery low mentality indeed. And, if I fail _this_ time, they will kill\r\nme, so as to make room for others who have a better right to live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed the young man indignantly. \"Why, you have a\r\nbetter mind than those of many of the leading scientists of the outer\r\nworld!\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" she gloomily replied, \"it is way below standard for\r\ndown here.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the day of the test, he did his best to cheer her up. Dolf also\r\ncame--she seemed to be an especial protege of his--and gave her his\r\nencouragement. He had been coaching her heavily for the examinations\r\nfor some time previous.\r\n\r\nBut later in the day she returned in tears to report to Abbot that she\r\nhad failed, and had only twenty-four hours to live. Before he realized\r\nwhat he was doing, Abbot had seized her in his arms, and was pouring\r\nout to her a love which up to that moment he had not realized\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nFinally her sobbing ceased, and she smiled through her tears.\r\n\r\n\"George, dear,\" said she, \"it is worth dying, to know that you care\r\nfor me like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't let them kill you!\" asserted the young man belligerently.\r\n\"They owe me something for the assistance which I am to give them on\r\ntheir expedition. I shall demand your life as the price of my\r\ncooperation. Besides, you are the only one of all your people who has\r\nbrains enough to understand what I tell them about the outer earth. It\r\nis they who are weak-minded; not you!\"\r\n\r\nBut she sadly shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"It would never do for you to sponsor me,\" said she, \"for it would\r\nalienate my one friend in power, Dolf. He loves me; no, don't scowl,\r\nfor I do not love him. But, for the safety of both of us, we must not\r\nlet him know of our love--yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Yet'?\" exclaimed Abbot, \"when you have less than a day to live?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have given me hope,\" the girl replied, \"and also an idea. Dolf\r\npromised to appeal to the other members of the Five. I have just\r\nthought of a good ground for his appeal; namely, my ability to\r\ntranslate your clumsy description into a form suited to the high\r\nintelligence of our superiors.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Clumsy'?\" exclaimed the young man, a bit nettled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pardon me, dear. I'm so sorry,\" said she contritely. \"I didn't\r\nmean to let it slip. And now I must rush to Dolf and tell him my\r\nidea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let him make love to you, though!\" admonished Abbot gloomily.\r\n\r\nShe kissed him lightly, and fled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA half hour later she was back, all smiles. The idea had gone across\r\nbig. Dolf, as the leader of the projected expedition, had demanded\r\nthat Milli be brought along as liaison officer between them and their\r\nguide; and the other four committeemen had reluctantly acceded. The\r\nexecution was accordingly indefinitely postponed.\r\n\r\nThe young couple spent the evening making happy plans for their life\r\ntogether on the outer earth, for as soon as they should arrive in\r\nAmerica, Dolf would have no further hold over them.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the Committee of Five announced that, for a change, they\r\nwere going to give George Abbot an intelligence test. He had\r\nrepresented himself as being one of the scientists of the outer earth;\r\naccordingly, they could gauge the caliber of his fellow countrymen by\r\ndetermining his I. Q.\r\n\r\nMilli was quite agitated when this program was announced, but the\r\nordeal held no terrors for George Abbot. Had he not taken many such\r\ntests on earth and passed them easily?\r\n\r\nSo he appeared before the Committee of Five with a rather cocky air.\r\nHe had yet to see an intelligence test too tricky for him to eat\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n\"Start him with something easy,\" suggested Dolf. \"Perhaps they don't\r\nhave tests on the outer earth. You know, one gains a certain facility\r\nby practice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Milli didn't, in spite of all the practicing which you gave her,\"\r\nmaliciously remarked Thig.\r\n\r\nDolf glowered at him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"What is the cube root of 378?\" suddenly asked one of the other\r\nmembers of the committee.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a little over seven,\" hazarded Abbot.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" boomed Thig: \"give it to us exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, seven-point-two, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't guess. Give it exact, to four decimal places.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my head?\" asked Abbot incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly!\" replied Thig. \"Even a child could do that. We're giving\r\nyou easy questions to start with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Start him on _square_ root,\" suggested Dolf kindly. \"Remember he\r\nisn't used to these tests like our people are.\"\r\n\r\nSo they tried him with square root, in which he turned out to be\r\nequally dumb.\r\n\r\nAbstract questions of physics and chemistry he did better on; but the\r\nactual quantitative problems, which they expected him to solve in his\r\nhead, stumped him completely.\r\n\r\nThen they asked him about education on earth, and the qualifications\r\nfor becoming a scientist, and who were the leaders in his field, and\r\nwhat degrees they held, and what one had to do to get those degrees,\r\netc. Finally they dismissed him. Dolf then sent for Milli.\r\n\r\nShe was gone about an hour, and returned to Abbot wide-eyed and\r\nincredulous.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, George,\" said she, lowering her voice. \"Dolf tells me that your\r\nintelligence is below that of a five-year-old child! Perhaps that is\r\nwhy you and I get along so well together: we are both morons.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe started to protest, but she silenced him with a gesture and hurried\r\non. \"I am not supposed to tell you this, but I want you to know that\r\nyour examination to-day has resulted in a complete change in their\r\nplans for the expedition to the surface. They have consulted with the\r\nleaders of our masters, and they agree with them.\"\r\n\r\nShe was plainly agitated.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, dear?\" asked Abbot, with ominous foreboding.\r\n\r\nMilli continued: \"Early during your test, when you demonstrated that\r\nyou couldn't do the very simplest mathematical problems in your head,\r\nthey began to doubt your boastings that you are a scientist. But you\r\nwere so ingenuous in your answers about conditions on the surface,\r\nthat finally their faith in your honesty returned. If you are a\r\nscientist among men, as they now believe, then the average run of your\r\npeople must be mere animals. This explains what has puzzled them\r\nbefore; namely, how the people of the earth tolerate poverty and\r\nunemployment and crime, and disease and war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"And so a mere handful of our people, by purely peaceful means, could\r\neasily make themselves the rulers of the earth. Probably this would be\r\nall for the best; but somehow, my feelings tell me that it is not. I\r\nknow only too well what it is to be an inferior among intelligent\r\nbeings; so will not your people be happier, left alone to their\r\nstupidity, just as I would be?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge Abbot was crushed. This frank acceptance by Milli of the\r\nalleged fact that he was a mere moron, was most humiliating. And\r\nswiftly he realized what a real menace to the earth, was this\r\ncontemplated invasion from the deeps.\r\n\r\nAll that was worst in the world above would taint these intellectual\r\ngiants of the undersea. They would rise to supremacy, and then would\r\nbecome rapacious tyrants over those whom they would regard as being no\r\nmore than animals.\r\n\r\nHe had witnessed jealousies among them down below. Might not these\r\njealousies flame into huge wars when translated to the world above?\r\nGiants striving for mastery, using the human cattle as cannon fodder!\r\nHe painted to the girl a word-picture of the horrible vision which he\r\nforesaw.\r\n\r\nThe invasion must be stopped at all costs! He and Milli must pit their\r\npuny wits against these supermen!\r\n\r\nBut what could they do? As they were pondering this problem, a girl\r\nentered their sitting room--the same who had brought Abbot's\r\nbreakfast on his first day in the caves. Milli introduced George to\r\nthe newcomer, whose name was Romehl.\r\n\r\nRomehl appeared so woebegone that the young American ventured to\r\ninquire if she too had been having difficulty with one of her tests.\r\nBut that was not the trouble; hers was rather of the heart.\r\n\r\nAbout the same age as Milli, Romehl had recently passed her twentieth\r\nbirthday test and hence was eligible to marry; so she and a young man\r\nnamed Hakin had requested the fish-masters to give them the requisite\r\npermission. But their overlords for some reason had peremptorily\r\ndenied the request. Romehl and Hakin were desolate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYoung Abbot's sympathies were at once aroused.\r\n\r\n\"Can't something be done?\" he started to ask.\r\n\r\nBut Milli silenced him with a warning glance. \"Of course not!\" she\r\nsaid. \"Who are we to question the judgment of our all-knowing\r\nmasters?\"\r\n\r\nRomehl had really come to Milli just to pour her troubles into a\r\nfriendly ear, rather than because she hoped to get any helpful ideas.\r\nSo she had a good cry, and finally left, somewhat comforted.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Milli then took up again the problem of saving the outer\r\nearth from the threatened invasion. Milli suggested that they go\r\npeaceably with the expedition, and then warn the authorities of\r\nAmerica at the first opportunity after their arrival; but Abbot\r\npointed out that this would merely result in their both being shut up\r\nin some insane asylum, as no one would believe such a crazy story as\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nThe time for lights to be put out arrived without their thinking of\r\nany better idea.\r\n\r\nNext day Milli spent considerable time with Dolf, and on her return\r\nexcitedly informed Abbot that he had evolved a most diabolical plot.\r\nThere were sufficient quantities of explosives in storage to blast a\r\nhole through the wall of the caves, letting in the sea and killing\r\neveryone in the city. Dolf planned to set this off with a time fuse,\r\nupon the departure of the expedition. Thus Thig and the people who\r\nwere left behind--about two-thirds of the total population of the\r\ncity--would be destroyed, and the fish would have no one to send after\r\nDolf and his followers to dictate to them on the upper earth.\r\n\r\nRelieved of the thraldom of the fish, Dolf could make himself Emperor\r\nof the World, and rule over the human cattle, with Milli at his side\r\nas Empress. An alluring program--from Dolf's point of view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I didn't expect such treason even from Dolf!\" exclaimed the young\r\nAmerican. \"We must tell Thig!\"\r\n\r\n\"What good would that do?\" remonstrated the girl. \"If you failed to\r\nconvince Thig, Dolf would make an end of us both. And if you convinced\r\nThig, it would mean the end of Dolf, whose influence is all that keeps\r\nme alive. We must think of something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, as always,\" replied Abbot.\r\n\r\nA growl came from the doorway. It was Dolf, his bearded face black\r\nwith wrath.\r\n\r\n\"So?\" he sputtered. \"Treachery, eh?\"\r\n\r\nHe whistled twice and two guards appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Take them to the prison!\" he raged, indicating Abbot and Milli. \"Our\r\nexpedition will have to do without a guide. I have learned enough of\r\nthe American language to make a good start, and I guess I can pick up\r\nanother guide when we reach the surface.\" Then, bending close to the\r\nfrightened girl, he whispered, \"And another Empress.\"\r\n\r\nThe guards hustled them away and locked them up. As an added\r\nprecaution, a sentinel was posted in front of each cell door.\r\n\r\nAbbot immediately got busy.\r\n\r\n\"Can you get word for me at once to Thig?\" he whispered to the man on\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" replied that individual non-committally.\r\n\r\n\"Then tell him,\" said Abbot, \"that I have proof that Dolf is planning\r\nto destroy this city behind him, and never return from the surface.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentry became immediately agitated.\r\n\r\n\"So you know this?\" he exclaimed. \"How did it leak out? But--through\r\nMilli, of course. And the guard on her cell is not a member of the\r\nexpedition! Curses! I must get word to Dolf, and have that guard\r\nchanged at once.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he darted swiftly away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young prisoner was plunged into gloom. Now he'd gone and done it!\r\nWhy hadn't he first made appropriate inquiries of his guard?\r\n\r\nA new guard appeared in front of the door.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going on the expedition?\" asked Abbot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, worse luck,\" replied the guard.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner forgot his own gloom, in his surprise at the gloominess\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to go?\" he exclaimed incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Romehl?\" asked the guard.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Abbot replied.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's why.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must be Hakin!\" exclaimed Abbot, with sudden understanding.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the other dully.\r\n\r\n\"You are going on the expedition, and Romehl is not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite correct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, look here!\" exclaimed Abbot, and then he launched into the\r\ndescription of a plan, which just that moment had occurred to him, for\r\nhim, Milli, Romehl and Hakin to make their getaway ahead of the\r\nexpedition--in fact, that very night--and to set off the time-fuse\r\nbefore leaving.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that Hakin knew where the explosives were planted, and\r\nwhere the submarines were kept, and even how to operate them. He\r\neagerly accepted the plan; and when next relieved as sentinel, he\r\nhurried away to inform Romehl.\r\n\r\nThree hours later he was back on post. Quickly he explained to his\r\nprisoner all about the workings of the submarines of the expedition.\r\nThe lights-out bell rang, and all the city became dark, except for dim\r\nlights in the passageways. Hakin at once unlocked the door of Abbot's\r\ncell, and together the two young men sneaked down the corridor to the\r\ncell where Milli was confined.\r\n\r\nSilently Hakin and Abbot sprang upon the guard and throttled him; then\r\nreleased Milli. There was no time for more than a few hurried words of\r\nexplanation before the three of them left the prison and made for the\r\nlocks of the subterranean canal, picking up Romehl at a preappointed\r\nspot on the way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe canal locks were unguarded, as well as the storerooms of the\r\nsubmarines. Each of the rooms held two subs, and could open onto the\r\nsecond lock and be separately flooded.\r\n\r\nThe submarines were of steel as thick as Abbot's bathysphere. Their\r\nshape was that of an elongated rain drop, with fins. In the pointed\r\ntip of their tails were motors which could operate at any pressure. At\r\nthe front end were quartz windows. In the top fin was an expanding\r\ndevice which could be filled with buoyant gas, produced by chemicals,\r\nwhen the craft neared the surface. Each submarine also contained a\r\nradio set, so tuned as to be capable of opening and closing the\r\nradio-controlled gates of the locks. Each would carry comfortably two\r\nor three persons.\r\n\r\nHaving picked out two submarines and found them to be in order, Hakin\r\nsneaked back into the corridor to set off the time-fuse, leaving his\r\nthree companions in the dark in the storeroom. Abbot put a protecting\r\narm around Milli, while Romehl snuggled close to her other side.\r\n\r\nTheir hearts were all racing madly with excitement, and this was\r\nintensified when they heard Hakin talking with someone just outside\r\ntheir door.\r\n\r\nThen Hakin returned unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\"Something terrible has happened!\" he breathed. \"The explosives have\r\nbeen discovered and are gone. One of the expedition men has just\r\ninformed me. Someone must have gotten word to Thig--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, _I_ did,\" interrupted Milli. \"I told my guard, just before they\r\ncame and changed him.\"\r\n\r\nAbbot groaned.\r\n\r\nHakin continued hurriedly: \"So Dolf plans to leave at once. He is\r\nalready rounding up his followers. Come on! We must get out ahead of\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\nAn uproar could be heard drawing near in the corridor outside. Abbot\r\nopened the door and peered out; then shut it again and whispered, \"The\r\ntwo factions are fighting already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come on!\" exclaimed Hakin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he turned on the lights, wedged the door tight against its\r\ngaskets and threw the switch which started the water seeping into the\r\nstoreroom; then he led Romehl hurriedly to one of the two submarines,\r\nwhile George and Milli rushed to the other. Heavy blows sounded\r\nagainst the storeroom door.\r\n\r\nThe water rapidly rose about them, and the four friends crawled\r\ninside the two machines and clamped the lids tight. Then they waited\r\nfor sufficient depth, so that they could get under way.\r\n\r\nThe water rose above their bow windows, but suddenly and inexplicably\r\nit began to subside again. A man waded by around the bow of Abbot's\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\"They've crashed in the door, and are pumping out the water again!\"\r\nexclaimed Abbot. \"We're trapped!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet!\" grimly replied the girl at his side. \"Can you work the\r\nradio door controls?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then quick! Open the doors into the lock!\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button. Ahead of them two gates swung inward, followed by\r\na deluge of water.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" spoke the girl. \"Full speed ahead, before the water gets\r\ntoo low.\"\r\n\r\nAbbot did so. Out into the lock they sped, in the face of the surging\r\ncurrent. Then Abbot pushed another button to close the gates behind\r\nthem. But the water continued to fall, and they grounded before they\r\nreached the end of the lock. Quite evidently the rush of the current\r\nhad kept the doors from closing behind them. The city was being\r\nflooded through the broken door of the storeroom.\r\n\r\nBut Abbot opened the next gate, and again they breasted the incoming\r\ntorrent. This time, although the level continued to fall, their craft\r\ndid not quite ground.\r\n\r\n\"They must have got the gates shut behind us at last,\" said he, as he\r\nopened the next set and pressed on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd then he had an idea. Why not omit to close any further gates\r\nbehind him? As a result, the sea pressure would eventually break down\r\nthe inmost barriers, and destroy the city as effectively as Dolf's\r\nbomb would have done. But he said nothing to Milli of this plan: she\r\nmight wish to save her people.\r\n\r\nGate after gate they passed. This was too simple. A few more locks and\r\nthey would be out in open water. The submarine of Hakin and Romehl\r\nswept by--evidently to let George and Milli know their presence--and\r\nthen dropped behind again. But was it their two friends after all? It\r\nmight have been some enemy! They could not be sure.\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty cast a chill of apprehension over them, which was\r\nimmediately heightened by the sudden extinguishing of the overhead\r\nlights of the tunnel. Abbot pressed the radio button for the next set\r\nof locks, but they did not budge.\r\n\r\n\"What can be the matter?\" he asked frantically.\r\n\r\n\"My people must have turned off the electric current,\" Milli replied.\r\n\"The gates won't open without electricity to feed the motors. We're\r\ntrapped again.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment they lay stunned by a realization that their escape was\r\nblocked.\r\n\r\n\"Kiss me good-by, dear,\" breathed Milli. \"This is the end.\"\r\n\r\nAs the young man reached over to take her in his arms, the submarine\r\nwas suddenly lifted up and spun backward, end over end: then tumbled\r\nand bumped along, as though it were a chip on an angry mountain\r\ntorrent.\r\n\r\nStunned and bruised and bleeding, the young American finally lost\r\nconsciousness....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he came to his senses again, his first words were, \"Milli, where\r\nare you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My darling!\" breathed a voice at his side. \"Are you all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied. \"Where are we? What has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"The entire system of locks must have crashed in and flooded the\r\ncity,\" said she.\r\n\r\nInstantly Abbott's mind grasped the explanation of this occurrence:\r\ntheir leaving open so many gates behind them had made it impossible\r\nfor the few remaining gates ahead to withstand the terrific pressures\r\nof the ocean depths, and they had crumpled. But he did not tell Milli\r\nhis part in this.\r\n\r\nShe continued, \"I was pretty badly shaken up myself, but I've got this\r\nboat going again, and we're on our way out of the tunnel. See--I've\r\nfound out how to work our searchlight.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked. A broad beam of light from their bow, illuminated the\r\ntunnel ahead of them.\r\n\r\nPresently another beam appeared, shooting by them from behind.\r\n\r\n\"Hakin and Romehl!\" exclaimed the girl. \"Then they're safe, too!\"\r\n\r\nThe tunnel walls grew rough, then disappeared. They were out in the\r\nopen sea at last, although still one mile beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nBut in front of them was an angry seething school of the man-sharks,\r\nclearly illumined by the two rays of light. Behind the sharks were a\r\nscore or more of serpentine steeds.\r\n\r\nThe sharks saw the two submarines and charged down upon them; but\r\nMilli, with great presence of mind, shut off her searchlight and swung\r\nsharply to the left.\r\n\r\n\"Up! Up!\" urged the young man, so she turned the craft upward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn and on they went, with no interference. Presently they turned the\r\nlight on again, so as to see what progress they were making. But they\r\nwere making absolutely none! They were merely standing on their tail.\r\nThey had reached a height of such relatively low pressure that it took\r\nall the churning of their propeller just merely to counteract the\r\ngreat weight of their submarine.\r\n\r\nAbbot switched on their chemical gas supply, and as their top fin\r\nexpanded into a balloon they again began to rise.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, perplexed the young man: the water about him\r\nseemed jet black rather than blue. They must by now be close to the\r\nsurface of the sea, where at least a twilight blue should be visible.\r\nEven at the one mile depth in his bathysphere, the water had been\r\nbrilliant, yet here, almost at the surface, he could see absolutely\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nHe switched on the searchlight again to make sure that their window\r\nwasn't clouded over; but it wasn't.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a rippling veil of pale silver appeared ahead; then a\r\nblue-black sky and twinkling stars. They had reached the surface, and\r\nit was night.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out the stars to the girl at his side, then swung the nose\r\nof the submarine around and showed her the moon.\r\n\r\nWhere next? George Abbot picked out his position by the stars and\r\nheaded east. East across the Pacific, toward America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut soon he noticed that their little craft was dropping beneath the\r\nsurface. He kept heading up more and more; he threw the lever for more\r\nand more chemical gas; yet still they continued to sink.\r\n\r\n\"Milli!\" he exclaimed, \"we've got to get out of here!\"\r\n\r\nShe clutched him in fear, for to her the pressure of the open sea\r\nmeant death, certain death. But he pushed her firmly away, and\r\nunclamped the lid of the submarine. In another instant he had hauled\r\nher out and was battling his way to the surface, while their little\r\nboat sunk slowly beneath them.\r\n\r\nMilli was an experienced swimmer, for the undersea folk enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of a large indoor pool. As soon as she found that the open\r\nsea did not kill her, she became calm.\r\n\r\nSide by side they floated in the moonlight. The sky began to pink in\r\nthe east. Dawn came, the first dawn that Milli had ever seen.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she called George's attention to two bobbing heads some\r\ndistance away in the path of light the rising sun made on the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Hakin and Romehl!\" he exclaimed. Long since they had given them up\r\nfor dead; but evidently fate had treated them in much the same way as\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAnd a moment later his own salt-stung eyes noticed a long gray shape\r\nto one side.\r\n\r\nAs the day brightened, Abbot suddenly noticed a large bulking shape\r\nnearby.\r\n\r\nIt was his own boat!--the one which had lowered him into the depths in\r\nhis bathysphere so many weeks and weeks ago! Evidently it was still\r\nsticking around, grappling for his long dead body.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, dear,\" said he, and side by side they swam over to it.\r\n\r\nHe helped her up the ship's ladder. The ship's cook sleepily stuck his\r\nhead out of the galley door.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Mike,\" sang out George Abbot merrily to the astonished man.\r\n\"I've brought company for breakfast. And there'll be two more when we\r\ncan lower a boat.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Advertisement]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrood of the Dark Moon\r\n\r\n(_A Sequel to \"Dark Moon\"_)\r\n\r\nBEGINNING A FOUR-PART NOVEL\r\n\r\n_By Charles Willard Diffin_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _He landed one blow on the nearest face._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Once more Chet, Walt and Diane are united in a wild ride to\r\nthe Dark Moon--but this time they go as prisoners of their deadly\r\nenemy Schwartzmann.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n_The Message_\r\n\r\nIn a hospital in Vienna, in a room where sunlight flooded through\r\nultra-violet permeable crystal, the warm rays struck upon smooth walls\r\nthe color of which changed from hot reds to cool yellow or gray or to\r\nsoothing green, as the Directing Surgeon might order. An elusive\r\nblending of tones, now seemed pulsing with life; surely even a\r\nflickering flame of vitality would be blown into warm livingness in\r\nsuch a place.\r\n\r\nEven the chart case in the wall glittered with the same clean,\r\nbrilliant hues from its glass and metal door. The usual revolving\r\npaper disks showed white beyond the glass. They were moving; and the\r\nink lines grew to tell a story of temperature and respiration and of\r\nevery heart-beat.\r\n\r\nOn the identification-plate a name appeared and a date: \"Chet\r\nBullard--23 years. Admitted: August 10, 1973.\" And below that the\r\never-changing present ticked into the past in silent minutes: \"August\r\n15, 1973; World Standard Time: 10:38--10:39--10:40--\"\r\n\r\nFor five days the minutes had trickled into a rivulet of time that\r\nflowed past a bandaged figure in the bed below--a silent figure and\r\nunmoving, as one for whom time has ceased. But the surgeons of the\r\nAllied Hospital at Vienna are clever.\r\n\r\n10:41--10:42--The bandaged figure stirred uneasily on a snow-white\r\nbed....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA nurse was beside him in an instant. Was her patient about to recover\r\nconsciousness? She examined the bandages that covered a ragged wound\r\nin his side, where all seemed satisfactory. To all appearances the man\r\nwho had moved was unconscious still; the nurse could not know of the\r\nthought impressions, blurred at first, then gradually clearing, that\r\nwere flashing through his mind.\r\n\r\nFlashing; yet, to the man who struggled to comprehend them, they\r\npassed laggingly in review: one picture followed another with\r\nexasperating slowness....\r\n\r\nWhere was he? What had happened? He was hardly conscious of his own\r\nidentity....\r\n\r\nThere was a ship ... he held the controls ... they were flying low....\r\nOne hand reached fumblingly beneath the soft coverlet to search for a\r\ntriple star that should be upon his jacket. A triple star: the\r\ninsignia of a Master Pilot of the World!--and with the movement there\r\ncame clearly a realization of himself.\r\n\r\nChet Bullard, Master Pilot; he was Chet Bullard ... and a wall of\r\nwater was sweeping under him from the ocean to wipe out the great\r\nHarkness Terminal buildings.... It was Harkness--Walt Harkness--from\r\nwhom he had snatched the controls.... To fly to the Dark Moon, of\r\ncourse--\r\n\r\nWhat nonsense was that?... No, it was true: the Dark Moon had raised\r\nthe devil with things on Earth.... How slowly the thoughts came! Why\r\ncouldn't he remember?...\r\n\r\nDark Moon!--and they were flying through space.... They had conquered\r\nspace; they were landing on the Dark Moon that was brilliantly alight.\r\nWalt Harkness had set the ship down beautifully--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, crowding upon one another in breath-taking haste, came clear\r\nrecollection of past adventures:\r\n\r\nThey were upon the Dark Moon--and there was the girl, Diane. They must\r\nsave Diane. Harkness had gone for the ship. A savage, half-human shape\r\nwas raising a hairy arm to drive a spear toward Diane, and he, Chet,\r\nwas leaping before her. He felt again the lancet-pain of that\r\nblade....\r\n\r\nAnd now he was dying--yes, he remembered it now--dying in the night on\r\na great, sweeping surface of frozen lava.... It was only a moment\r\nbefore that he had opened his eyes to see Harkness' strained face and\r\nthe agonized look of Diane as the two leaned above him.... But now he\r\nfelt stronger. He must see them again....\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes for another look at his companions--and, instead of\r\nblack, star-pricked night on a distant globe, there was dazzling\r\nsunlight. No desolate lava-flow, this; no thousand fires that flared\r\nand smoked from their fumeroles in the dark. And, instead of Harkness\r\nand the girl, Diane, leaning over him there was a nurse who laid one\r\ncool hand upon his blond head and who spoke soothingly to him of\r\nkeeping quiet. He was to take it easy--he would understand later--and\r\neverything was all right.... And with this assurance Chet Bullard\r\ndrifted again into sleep....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe blurring memories had lost their distortions a week later, as he\r\nsat before a broad window in his room and looked out over the\r\nhousetops of Vienna. Again he was himself, Chet Bullard, with a Master\r\nPilot's rating: and he let his eyes follow understandingly the moving\r\npicture of the world outside. It was good to be part of a world whose\r\nevery movement he understood.\r\n\r\nThose cylinders with stubby wings that crossed and recrossed the sky;\r\ntheir sterns showed a jet of thin vapor where a continuous explosion\r\nof detonite threw them through the air. He knew them all: the pleasure\r\ncraft, the big, red-bellied freighters, the sleek liners, whose\r\nmultiple helicopters spun dazzlingly above as they sank down through\r\nthe shaft of pale-green light that marked a descending area.\r\n\r\nThat one would be the China Mail. Her under-ports were open before the\r\nhold-down clamps had gripped her; the mail would pour out in an\r\navalanche of pouches where smaller mailships waited to distribute the\r\ncargo across the land.\r\n\r\nAnd the big fellow taking off, her hull banded with blue, was one of\r\nSchwartzmann's liners. He wondered what had become of Schwartzmann,\r\nthe man who had tried to rob Harkness of his ship; who had brought the\r\npatrol ships upon them in an effort to prevent their take-off on that\r\nwild trip.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, what had become of Harkness? Chet Bullard was\r\nseriously disturbed at the absence of any word beyond the one message\r\nthat had been waiting for him when he regained consciousness. He drew\r\nthat message from a pocket of his dressing gown and read it again:\r\n\r\n     \"Chet, old fellow, lie low. S has vanished. Means mischief.\r\n     Think best not to see you or reveal your whereabouts until\r\n     our position firmly established. Have concealed ship.\r\n     Remember, S will stop at nothing. Trying to discredit us,\r\n     but the gas I brought will fix all that. Get yourself well.\r\n     We are planning to go back, of course. Walt.\"\r\n\r\nChet returned the folded message to his pocket. He arose and walked\r\nabout the room to test his returning strength: to remain idle was\r\nbecoming increasingly difficult. He wanted to see Walter Harkness,\r\ntalk with him, plan for their return to the wonder-world they had\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstead he dropped again into his chair and touched a knob on the\r\nnewscaster beside him. A voice, hushed to the requirements of these\r\nhospital precincts spoke softly of market quotations in the far\r\ncorners of the earth. He turned the dial irritably and set it on\r\n\"World News--General.\" The name of Harkness came from the instrument\r\nto focus Chet's attention.\r\n\r\n\"Harkness makes broad claims,\" the voice was saying. \"Vienna\r\nphysicists ridicule his pretensions.\r\n\r\n\"Walter Harkness, formerly of New York, proprietor of Harkness\r\nTerminals, whose great buildings near New York were destroyed in the\r\nDark Moon wave, claims to have reached and returned from the Dark\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly two months have passed since the new satellite crashed into\r\nthe gravitational field of Earth, its coming manifested by earth\r\nshocks and a great tidal wave. The globe, as we know, was invisible.\r\nAlthough still unseen, and only a black circle that blocks out distant\r\nstars, it is visible in the telescopes of the astronomers; its\r\ndistance and its orbital motion have been determined.\r\n\r\n\"And now this New Yorker claims to have penetrated space: to have\r\nlanded on the Dark Moon: and to have returned to Earth. Broad claims,\r\nindeed, especially so in view of the fact that Harkness refuses to\r\nsubmit his ship for examination by the Stratosphere Control Board. He\r\nhas filed notice of ownership, thus introducing some novel legal\r\ntechnicalities, but, since space-travel is still a dream of the\r\nfuture, there will be none to dispute his claims.\r\n\r\n\"Of immediate interest is Harkness' claim to have discovered a gas\r\nthat is fatal to the serpents of space. The monsters that appeared\r\nwhen the Dark Moon came and that attacked ships above the Repelling\r\nArea are still there. All flying is confined to the lower levels; fast\r\nworld-routes are disorganized.\r\n\r\n\"Whether or not this gas, of which Harkness has a sample, came from\r\nthe Dark Moon or from some laboratory on Earth is of no particular\r\nimportance. Will it destroy the space-serpents? If it does this, our\r\nhats are off to Mr. Walter Harkness; almost will we be inclined to\r\nbelieve the rest of his story--or to laugh with him over one of the\r\ngreatest hoaxes ever attempted.\"\r\n\r\nChet had been too intent upon the newscast to heed an opening door at\r\nhis back....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"How about it, Chet?\" a voice was asking. \"Would you call it a hoax or\r\nthe real thing?\" And a girl's voice chimed in with exclamations of\r\ndelight at sight of the patient, so evidently recovering.\r\n\r\n\"Diane!\" Chet exulted, \"--and Walt!--you old son-of-a-gun!\" He found\r\nhimself clinging to a girl's soft hand with one of his, while with the\r\nother he reached for that of her companion. But Walt Harkness' arm\r\nwent about his shoulders instead.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to hammer you plenty,\" Harkness was saying, \"and I don't\r\neven dare give you a friendly slam on the back. How's the side where\r\nthey got you with the spear?--and how are you? How soon will you be\r\nready to start back? What about--\"\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer raised her one free hand to stop the flood of\r\nquestions. \"My dear,\" she protested, \"give Chet a chance. He must be\r\ndying for information.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was dying for another reason the last time I saw you,\" Chet\r\nreminded her, \"--up on the Dark Moon. But it seems that you got me\r\nback here in time for repairs. And now what?\" His nurse came into the\r\nroom with extra chairs; Chet waited till she was gone before he\r\nrepeated: \"Now what? When do we go back?\"\r\n\r\nHarkness did not answer at once. Instead he crossed to the newscaster\r\nin its compact, metal case. The voice was still speaking softly; at a\r\ntouch of a switch it ceased, and in the silence came the soft rush of\r\nsound that meant the telautotype had taken up its work. Beneath a\r\nglass a paper moved, and words came upon it from a hurricane of\r\ntype-bars underneath. The instrument was printing the news story as\r\nrapidly as any voice could speak it.\r\n\r\nHarkness read the words for an instant, then let the paper pass on to\r\nwind itself upon a spool. It had still been telling of the gigantic\r\nhoax that this eccentric American had attempted and Harkness repeated\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\n\"A hoax!\" he exclaimed, and his eyes, for a moment, flashed angrily\r\nbeneath the dark hair that one hand had disarranged. \"I would like to\r\ntake that facetious bird out about a thousand miles and let him play\r\naround with the serpents we met. But, why get excited? This is all\r\nSchwartzmann's doing. The tentacles of that man's influence, reach out\r\nlike those of an octopus.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet ranged himself alongside. Tall and slim and blond, he contrasted\r\nstrongly with this other man, particularly in his own quiet\r\nself-control as against Harkness' quick-flaring anger.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy, Walt,\" he advised. \"We'll show them. But I judge that\r\nyou have been razzed a bit. It's a pretty big story for them to\r\nswallow without proof. Why didn't you show them the ship? Or why\r\ndidn't you let Diane and me back up your yarn? And you haven't\r\nanswered my other questions: when do we go back?\"\r\n\r\nHarkness took the queries in turn.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't show the old boat,\" he explained, \"because I'm not ready\r\nfor that yet. I want it kept dark--dark as the Dark Moon. I want to do\r\nmy preliminary work there before Schwartzmann and his experts see our\r\nship. He would duplicate it in a hurry and be on our trail.\r\n\r\n\"And now for our plans. Well, out there in space the Dark Moon is\r\nwaiting. Have you realized, Chet, that we own that world--you and\r\nDiane and I? Small--only half the size of our old moon--but what a\r\nplace! And it's ours!\r\n\r\n\"Back in history--you remember?--an ambitious lad named Alexander\r\nsighed for more worlds to conquer. Well, we're going Alexander one\r\nbetter--we've found the world. We're the first ever to go out into\r\nspace and return again.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go back there, the three of us. We will take no others\r\nalong--not yet. We will explore and make our plans for development;\r\nand we will keep it to ourselves until we are ready to hold it against\r\nany opposition.\r\n\r\n\"And now, how soon can you go? Your injury--how soon will you be well\r\nenough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now,\" Chet told him laconically; \"to-day, if you say the word.\r\nThey've got me welded together so I'll hold, I reckon. But where's the\r\nship? What have you done--\" He broke off abruptly to listen--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo all three came a muffled, booming roar. The windows beside them\r\nshivered with the thud of the distant explosion; they had not ceased\r\ntheir trembling before Harkness had switched on the news broadcast.\r\nAnd it was a minute only until the news-gathering system was on the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"Explosion at the Institute of Physical Science!\" it said. \"This is\r\nVienna broadcasting. An explosion has just occurred. We are giving a\r\npreliminary announcement only. The laboratories of the Scientific\r\nInstitute of this city are destroyed. A number of lives have been\r\nlost. The cause has not been determined. It is reported that the\r\nlaboratories were beginning analytical work, on the so-called Harkness\r\nDark Moon gas--\r\n\r\n\"Confirmation has just been radioed to this station. Dark Moon gas\r\nexploded on contact with air. The American, Harkness, is either a\r\ncriminal or a madman; he will be apprehended at once. This\r\nconfirmation comes from Herr Schwartzmann of Vienna who left the\r\nInstitute only a few minutes before the explosion occurred--\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in the quiet of a hospital room, Walter Harkness, drew a long\r\nbreath and whispered: \"Schwartzmann! His hand is everywhere.... And\r\nthat sample was all I had.... I must leave at once--go back to\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nHe was halfway to the door--he was almost carrying Diane Delacouer\r\nwith him--when Chet's quiet tones brought him up short.\r\n\r\n\"I've never seen you afraid,\" said Chet; and his eyes were regarding\r\nthe other man curiously; \"but you seem to have the wind up, as the old\r\nflyers used to say, when it comes to Schwartzmann.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness looked at the girl he held so tightly, then grinned boyishly\r\nat Chet. \"I've someone else to be afraid for now,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHis smile faded and was replaced by a look of deep concern. \"I haven't\r\ntold you about Schwartzmann,\" he said; \"haven't had time. But he's\r\npoison, Chet. And he's after our ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the ship; where have you hidden it? Tell me--where?\"\r\n\r\nHarkness looked about him before he whispered sharply: \"Our old\r\nshop--up north!\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to feel that some explanation was due Chet. \"In this day it\r\nseems absurd to say such things,\" he added; \"but this Schwartzmann is\r\na throw-back--a conscienceless scoundrel. He would put all three of us\r\nout of the way in a minute if he could get the ship. _He_ knows we\r\nhave been to the Dark Moon--no question about that--and he wants the\r\nwealth he can imagine is there.\r\n\r\n\"We'll all plan to leave; I'll radio you later. We'll go back to the\r\nDark Moon--\" He broke off abruptly as the door opened to admit the\r\nnurse. \"You'll hear from me later,\" he repeated; and hurried Diane\r\nDelacouer from the room.\r\n\r\nBut he returned in a moment to stand again at the door--the nurse was\r\nstill in the room. \"In case you feel like going for a hop,\" he told\r\nChet casually, \"Diane's leaving her ship here for you. You'll find it\r\nup above--private landing stage on the roof.\"\r\n\r\nChet answered promptly, \"Fine; that will go good one of these days.\"\r\nAll this for the benefit of listening ears. Yet even Chet would have\r\nbeen astonished to know that he would be using that ship within an\r\nhour....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was standing at the window, and his mind was filled, not with\r\nthoughts of any complications that had developed for his friend\r\nHarkness, but only of the adventures that lay ahead of them both. The\r\nDark Moon!--they had reached it indeed; but they had barely scratched\r\nthe surface of that world of mystery and adventure. He was wild with\r\neagerness to return--to see again that new world, blazing brightly\r\nbeneath the sun; to see the valley of fires--and he had a score to\r\nsettle with the tribe of ape-men, unless Harkness had finished them\r\noff while he, himself, lay unconscious.... Yes, there seemed little\r\ndoubt of that; Walt would have paid the score for all of them.... He\r\nseemed actually back in that world to which his thoughts went winging\r\nacross the depths of space. The burr of a telephone recalled him.\r\n\r\nIt was the hospital office, he found, when he answered. There was a\r\nmessage--would Mr. Bullard kindly receive it on the telautotype--lever\r\nnumber four, and dial fifteen-point-two--thanks.... And Chet depressed\r\na key and adjusted the instrument that had been printing the newscast.\r\n\r\nThe paper moved on beneath the glass, and the type-bars clicked more\r\nslowly now. From some distant station that might be anywhere on or\r\nabove the earth, there was coming a message.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of that sending current was changed at some central\r\noffice; it was stepped down to suit the instrument beside him. And the\r\ntype was spelling out words that made the watching man breathless and\r\nintent--until he tore off the paper and leaped for the call signal\r\nthat would summon the nurse. Through her he would get his own clothes,\r\nhis uniform, the triple star that showed his rating and his authority\r\nin every air-level of the world.\r\n\r\nThat badge would have got him immediate attention on any landing\r\nfield. Now, on the flat roof, with steady, gray eyes and a voice whose\r\nvery quietness accentuated its imperative commands, Chet had the staff\r\nof the hospital hangars as alert as if their alarm had sounded a\r\ngeneral ambulance call.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStraight into the sky a red beacon made a rigid column of light; a\r\nradio sender was crackling a warning and a demand for \"clear air.\"\r\nFrom the forty level, a patrol ship that had caught the signal came\r\ncorkscrewing down the red shaft to stand by for emergency work....\r\nChet called her commander from the cabin of Diane's ship. A word of\r\nthanks--Chet's number--and a dismissal of the craft. Then the white\r\nlights signaled \"all clear\" and the hold-down levers let go with a\r\nsoft hiss--\r\n\r\nThe feel of the controls was good to his hands; the ship roared into\r\nlife. A beautiful little cruiser, this ship of Diane's; her twin\r\nhelicopters lifted her gracefully into the air. The column of red\r\nlight had changed to blue, the mark of an ascending area; Chet touched\r\na switch. A muffled roar came from the stern and the blast drove him\r\nstraight out for a mile; then he swung and returned. He was nosing up\r\nas he touched the blue--straight up--and he held the vertical climb\r\ntill the altimeter before him registered sixty thousand.\r\n\r\nTraffic is north-bound only on the sixty-level, and Chet set his ship\r\non a course for the frozen wastes of the Arctic; then he gave her the\r\ngun and nodded in tight-lipped satisfaction at the mounting thunder\r\nthat answered from the stern.\r\n\r\nOnly then did he read again the message on a torn fragment of\r\ntelautotype paper. \"Harkness,\" was the signature; and above, a brief\r\nwarning and a call--\"Danger--must leave at once. You get ship and\r\nstand by. I will meet you there.\" And, for the first time, Chet found\r\ntime to wonder at this danger that had set the hard-headed,\r\nhard-hitting Walt Harkness into a flutter of nerves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat danger could there be in this well-guarded world? A patrol-ship\r\npassed below him as he asked himself the question. It was symbolic of\r\na world at peace; a world too busy with its own tremendous development\r\nto find time for wars or makers of war. What trouble could this man\r\nSchwartzmann threaten that a word to the Peace Enforcement Commission\r\nwould not quell? Where could he go to elude the inescapable patrols?\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly Chet saw the answer to that question--saw plainly where\r\nSchwartzmann could go. Those vast reaches of black space! If\r\nSchwartzmann had their ship he could go where they had gone--go out to\r\nthe Dark Moon.... And Harkness had warned Chet to get their ship and\r\nstand by.\r\n\r\nHad Walt learned of some plan of Schwartzmann's? Chet could not answer\r\nthe question, but he moved the control rheostat over to the last\r\nnotch.\r\n\r\nFrom the body of the craft came an unending roar of a generator where\r\nnothing moved; where only the terrific, explosive impact of bursting\r\ndetonite drove out from the stern to throw them forward. \"A good\r\nlittle ship,\" Chet had said of this cruiser of Diane's; and he nodded\r\napproval now of a ground-speed detector whose quivering needle had\r\nleft the 500 mark. It touched 600, crept on, and trembled at 700 miles\r\nan hour with the top speed of the ship.\r\n\r\nThere was a position-finder in the little control room, and Chet's\r\ngaze returned to it often to see the pinpoint of light that crept\r\nslowly across the surface of a globe. It marked their ever-changing\r\nlocation, and it moved unerringly toward a predetermined goal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a place of ice and snow and bleak outcropping of half-covered\r\nrocks where he descended. Lost from the world, a place where even the\r\nhigh levels seldom echoed to the roar of passing ships, it had been a\r\nperfect location for their \"shop.\" Here he and Walt had assembled\r\ntheir mystery ship.\r\n\r\nHe had to search intently over the icy waste to find the exact\r\nlocation; a dim red glow from a hidden sun shone like pale fire\r\nacross distant black hills. But the hills gave him a bearing, and he\r\nlanded at last beside a vaguely outlined structure, half hidden in\r\ndrifting snow.\r\n\r\nThe dual fans dropped him softly upon the snow ground and Chet, as he\r\nwalked toward the great locked doors, was trembling from other causes\r\nthan the cold. Would the ship be there? He was suddenly a-quiver with\r\nexcitement at the thought of what this ship meant--the adventure, the\r\nexploration that lay ahead.\r\n\r\nThe doors swung back. In the warm and lighted room was a cylinder of\r\nsilvery white. Its bow ended in a gaping port where a mighty exhaust\r\ncould roar forth to check the ship's forward speed; there were other\r\nports ranged about the gleaming body. Above the hull a control-room\r\nprojected flatly; its lookouts shone in the brilliance of the nitron\r\nilluminator that flooded the room with light....\r\n\r\nChet Bullard was breathless as he moved on and into the room. His wild\r\nexperiences that had seemed but a weird dream were real again. The\r\nDark Moon was real! And they would be going back to it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe muffled beating of great helicopters was sounding in his ears;\r\noutside, a ship was landing. This would be Harkness coming to join\r\nhim; yet, even as the thought flashed through his mind, it was\r\ncountered by a quick denial. To the experienced hearing of the Master\r\nPilot this sound of many fans meant no little craft. It was a big ship\r\nthat was landing, and it was coming down fast. The blue-striped\r\nmonster looming large in the glow of the midnight sun was not entirely\r\na surprise to Chet's staring eyes.\r\n\r\nBut--blue-striped! The markings of the Schwartzmann line!--He had\r\nhardly sensed the danger when it was upon him.\r\n\r\nA man, heavy and broad of frame, was giving orders. Only once had Chet\r\nseen this Herr Schwartzmann, but there was no mistaking him now. And\r\nhe was sending a squad of rushing figures toward the man who struggled\r\nto close a great door.\r\n\r\nChet crouched to meet the attack. He was outnumbered; he could never\r\nwin out. But the knowledge of his own helplessness was nothing beside\r\nthat other conviction that flooded him with sickening certainty--\r\n\r\nA hoax!--that was what they had called Walt's story; Schwartzmann had\r\nso named it, and now Schwartzmann had been the one to fool them; the\r\nmessage was a fake--a bait to draw him out; and he, Chet, had taken\r\nthe bait. He had led Schwartzmann here; had delivered their ship into\r\nhis hands--\r\n\r\nHe landed one blow on the nearest face; he had one glimpse of a\r\nclubbed weapon swinging above him--and the world went dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_Into Space_\r\n\r\nA pulsing pain that stabbed through his head was Chet's first\r\nconscious impression. Then, as objects came slowly into focus before\r\nhis eyes, he knew that above him a ray of light was striking\r\nslantingly through the thick glass of a control-room lookout.\r\n\r\nOther lookouts were black, the dead black of empty space. Through\r\nthem, sparkling points of fire showed here and there--suns, sending\r\ntheir light across millions of years to strike at last on a speeding\r\nship. But, from the one port that caught the brighter light, came that\r\nstraight ray to illumine the room.\r\n\r\n\"Space,\" thought Chet vaguely. \"That is the sunlight of space!\"\r\n\r\nHe was trying to arrange his thoughts in some sensible sequence. His\r\nhead!--what had happened to his head?... And then he remembered. Again\r\nhe saw a clubbed weapon descending, while the face of Schwartzmann\r\nstared at him through bulbous eyes....\r\n\r\nAnd this control-room where he lay--he knew in an instant where he\r\nwas. It was his own ship that was roaring and trembling beneath\r\nhim--his and Walt Harkness'--it was flying through space! And, with\r\nthe sudden realization of what this meant, he struggled to arise. Only\r\nthen did he see the figure at the controls.\r\n\r\nThe man was leaning above an instrument board; he straightened to\r\nstare from a rear port while he spoke to someone Chet could not see.\r\n\r\n\"There's more of 'em coming!\" he said in a choked voice. \"_Mein Gott!_\r\nNeffer can we get away!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe fumbled with shaking hands at instruments and controls; and now\r\nChet saw his chalk-white face and read plainly the terror that was\r\nwritten there. But the cords that cut into his own wrists and ankles\r\nreminded him that he was bound; he settled back upon the floor. Why\r\nstruggle? If this other pilot was having trouble let him get out of it\r\nby himself--let him kill his own snakes!\r\n\r\nThat the man was having trouble there was no doubt. He looked once\r\nmore behind him as if at something that pursued; then swung the\r\nball-control to throw the ship off her course.\r\n\r\nThe craft answered sluggishly, and Chet Bullard grinned where he lay\r\nhelpless upon the floor; for he knew that his ship should have been\r\nthrown crashingly aside with such a motion as that. The answer was\r\nplain: the flask of super-detonite was exhausted; here was the last\r\nfeeble explosion of the final atoms of the terrible explosive that was\r\nbeing admitted to the generator. And to cut in another flask meant the\r\nopening of a hidden valve.\r\n\r\nChet forgot the pain of his swelling hands to shake with suppressed\r\nmirth. This was going to be good! He forgot it until, through a\r\nlookout, he saw a writhing, circling fire that wrapped itself about\r\nthe ship and jarred them to a halt.\r\n\r\nThe serpents!--those horrors from space that had come with the coming\r\nof the Dark Moon! They had disrupted the high-level traffic of the\r\nworld; had seized great liners; torn their way in; stripped these of\r\nevery living thing, and let the empty shells crash back to earth. Chet\r\nhad forgotten or he had failed to realize the height at which this new\r\npilot was flying. Only speed could save them; the monsters, with their\r\nsnouts that were great suction-cups, could wrench off a metal\r\ndoor--tear out the glass from a port!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe saw the luminous mass crush itself against a forward lookout and\r\nfelt the jar of its body against their ship. Soft and vaporous, these\r\ncloud-like serpents seemed as they drifted through space; yet the\r\nimpact, when they struck, proved that this new matter had mass.\r\n\r\nChet saw the figure at the controls stagger back and cower in fear;\r\nthe man's bullet-shaped head was covered by his upraised arms: there\r\nwas some horror outside those windows that his eyes had no wish to\r\nsee. Beside him the towering figure of Schwartzmann appeared; he had\r\nsprung into Chet's view, and he screamed orders at the fear-stricken\r\npilot.\r\n\r\n\"Fool! Swine!\" Schwartzmann was shouting. \"Do something! You said you\r\ncould fly this ship!\" In desperation he leaped forward and reached for\r\nthe controls himself.\r\n\r\nChet's blurred faculties snapped sharply to attention. That yellow\r\nglow against the port--the jarring of their ship--it meant instant\r\ndestruction once that searching snout found some place where it could\r\nsecure a hold. If the air-pressure within the ship were released; if\r\neven a crack were opened!--\r\n\r\n\"Here, you!\" he shouted to the frantic Schwartzmann who was jerking\r\nfrenziedly at the controls that no longer gave response. \"Cut these\r\nropes!--leave those instruments alone, you fool!\" He was suddenly\r\nvibrant with hate as he realized what this man had done: he had struck\r\nhim, Chet, down as he would have felled an animal for butchery; he had\r\nstolen their ship; and now he was losing it. Chet hardly thought of\r\nhis own desperate plight in his rage at this threat to their ship, and\r\nat Schwartzmann's inability to help himself.\r\n\r\n\"Cut these ropes!\" he repeated. \"Damn it all, turn me loose; I can fly\r\nus out!\" He added his frank opinion of Schwartzmann and all his men.\r\nAnd Schwartzmann, though his dark face flushed angrily red for one\r\ninstant, leaped to Chet's side and slashed at the cords with a knife.\r\n\r\nThe room swam before Chet's dizzy eyes as he came to his feet. He half\r\nfell, half drew himself full length toward the valve that he alone\r\nknew. Then again he was on his feet and he gripped at the ball-control\r\nwith one hand while he opened a master throttle that cut in this new\r\nsupply of explosive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room had been silent with the silence of empty space, save only\r\nfor the scraping of a horrid body across the ship's outer shell. The\r\nsilence was shattered now as if by the thunder of many guns. There\r\nwas no time for easing themselves into gradual flight. Chet thrust\r\nforward on the ball-control, and the blast from their stern threw the\r\nship as if it had been fired from a giant cannon.\r\n\r\nThe self-compensating floor swung back and up; Chet's weight was\r\nalmost unbearable as the ship beneath him leaped out and on, and the\r\nterrific blast that screamed and thundered urged this speeding shell\r\nto greater and still greater speed. And then, with the facility that\r\nthat speed gave, Chet's careful hands moved a tiny metal ball within\r\nits magnetic cage, and the great ship bellowed from many ports as it\r\nfollowed the motion of that ball.\r\n\r\nCould an eye have seen the wild, twisting flight, it must have seemed\r\nas if pilot and ship had gone suddenly mad. The craft corkscrewed and\r\nwhirled; it leaped upward and aside; and, as the glowing mass was\r\nthrown clear of the lookout, Chet's hand moved again to that maximum\r\nforward position, and again the titanic blast from astern drove them\r\non and out.\r\n\r\nThere were other shapes ahead, glowing lines of fire, luminous masses\r\nlike streamers of cloud that looped themselves into contorted forms\r\nand writhed vividly until they straightened into sharp lines of speed\r\nthat bore down upon the fleeing craft and the human food that was\r\nescaping these hungry snouts.\r\n\r\nChet saw them dead ahead; he saw the out-thrust heads, each ending in\r\na great suction-cup, the row of disks that were eyes blazing above,\r\nand the gaping maw below. He altered their course not a hair's breadth\r\nas he bore down upon them, while the monsters swelled prodigiously\r\nbefore his eyes. And the thunderous roar from astern came with never a\r\nbreak, while the ship itself ceased its trembling protest against the\r\nsudden blast and drove smoothly on and into the waiting beasts.\r\n\r\nThere was a hardly perceptible thudding jar. They were free! And the\r\nforward lookouts showed only the brilliant fires of distant suns and\r\none more glorious than the rest that meant a planet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet turned at last to face Schwartzmann and his pilot where they had\r\nclung helplessly to a metal stanchion. Four or five others crept in\r\nfrom the cabin aft; their blanched faces told of the fear that bad\r\ngripped them--fear of the serpents; fear, too, of the terrific plunges\r\ninto which the ship had been thrown. Chet Bullard drew the metal\r\ncontrol-ball back into neutral and permitted himself the luxury of a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"You're a fine bunch of highway-men,\" he told Schwartzmann; \"you'll\r\nsteal a ship you can't fly; then come up here above the R. A. level\r\nand get mixed up with those brutes. What's the idea? Did you think you\r\nwould just hop over to the Dark Moon? Some little plan like that in\r\nyour mind?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the dark, heavy face of Schwartzmann flushed deeply; but it was\r\nhis own men upon whom he turned.\r\n\r\n\"You,\" he told the pilot--\"you were so clever; you would knock this\r\nman senseless! You would insist that you could fly the ship!\"\r\n\r\nThe pilot's eyes still bulged with the fear he had just experienced.\r\n\"But, Herr Schwartzmann, it was you who told me--\"\r\n\r\nA barrage of unintelligible words cut his protest short. Schwartzmann\r\npoured forth imprecations in an unknown tongue, then turned to the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Back!\" he ordered. \"Bah!--such men! The danger it iss over--yess!\r\nThis pilot, he will take us back safely.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned his attention now to the waiting Chet. \"Herr Bullard, iss it\r\nnot--yess?\"\r\n\r\nHe launched into extended apologies--he had wanted a look at this so\r\nmarvelous ship--he had spied upon it; he admitted it. But this\r\nmurderous attack was none of his doing; his men had got out of hand;\r\nand then he had thought it best to take Chet, unconscious as he was,\r\nand return with him where he could have care.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd Chet Bullard kept his eyes steadily upon the protesting man and\r\nsaid nothing, but he was thinking of a number of things. There was\r\nWalt's warning, \"this Schwartzmann means mischief,\" and the faked\r\nmessage that had brought him from the hospital to get the ship from\r\nits hiding place; no, it was too much to believe. But Chet's eyes were\r\nunchanging, and he nodded shortly in agreement as the other concluded.\r\n\r\n\"You will take us back?\" Schwartzmann was asking. \"I will repay you\r\nwell for what inconvenience we have caused. The ship, you will return\r\nit safely to the place where it was?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet, after making and discarding a score of plans, knew there was\r\nnothing else he could do. He swung the little metal ball into a\r\nsharply-banked turn. The straight ray of light from an impossibly\r\nbrilliant sun struck now on a forward lookout; it shone across the\r\nshoulder of a great globe to make a white, shining crescent as of a\r\ngiant moon. It was Earth; and Chet brought the bow-sights to bear on\r\nthat far-off target, while again the thunderous blast was built up to\r\ndrive them back along the trackless path on which they had come. But\r\nhe wondered, as he pressed forward on the control, what the real plan\r\nof this man, Schwartzmann, might be....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLess than half an hour brought them to the Repelling Area, and Chet\r\nfelt the upward surge as he approached it. Here, above this magnetic\r\nfield where gravitation's pull was nullified, had been the air-lanes\r\nfor fast liners. Empty lanes they were now; for the R. A., as the\r\nflying fraternity knew it--the Heaviside Layer of an earlier\r\nday--marked the danger line above which the mysterious serpents lay in\r\nwait. Only the speed of Chet's ship saved them; more than one of the\r\nluminous monsters was in sight as he plunged through the invisible R.\r\nA. and threw on their bow-blast strongly to check their fall.\r\n\r\nThen, as he set a course that would take them to that section of the\r\nArctic waste where the ship had been, he pondered once more upon the\r\nsubject of this Schwartzmann of the shifty eyes and the glib tongue\r\nand of his men who had \"got out of hand\" and had captured this ship.\r\n\r\n\"Why in thunder are we back here?\" Chet asked himself in perplexity.\r\n\"This big boy means to keep the ship; and, whatever his plans may have\r\nbeen before, he will never stop short of the Dark Moon now that he has\r\nseen the old boat perform. Then why didn't he keep on when he was\r\nstarted? Had the serpents frightened him back?\"\r\n\r\nHe was still mentally proposing questions to which there seemed no\r\nanswer when he felt the pressure of a metal tube against his back. The\r\nvoice of Schwartzmann was in his ears.\r\n\r\n\"This is a detonite pistol\"--that voice was no longer unctuous and\r\nself-deprecating--\"one move and I'll plant a charge inside you that\r\nwill smash you to a jelly!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were hands that gripped Chet before he could turn; his arms were\r\nwrenched backward; he was helpless in the grip of Schwartzmann's men.\r\nThe former pilot sprang forward.\r\n\r\n\"Take control, Max!\" Schwartzmann snapped; but he followed it with a\r\nquestion while the pilot was reaching for the ball. \"You can fly it\r\nfor sure, Max?\"\r\n\r\nThe man called Max answered confidently.\r\n\r\n\"_Ja wohl!_\" he said with eager assurance. \"Up top there would have\r\nbeen no trouble yet for that _verdammt, verloren_ valve. That one\r\nexperimental trip is enough--I fly it!\"\r\n\r\nThose who held Chet were binding his wrists. He was thrown to the\r\nfloor while his feet were tied, and, as a last precaution, a gag was\r\nforced into his mouth. Schwartzmann left this work to his men. He paid\r\nno attention to Chet; he was busy at the radio.\r\n\r\nHe placed the sending-levers in strange positions that would effect a\r\nblending of wave lengths which only one receiving instrument could\r\npick up. He spoke cryptic words into the microphone, then dropped into\r\na language that was unfamiliar to Chet. Yet, even then, it was plain\r\nthat he was giving instructions, and he repeated familiar words.\r\n\r\n\"Harkness,\" Chet heard him say, and, \"--Delacouer--_ja!_--Mam'selle\r\nDelacouer!\"\r\n\r\nThen, leaving the radio, he said, \"Put my ship inside the hangar;\" and\r\nthe pilot, Max, grounded their own ship to allow the men to leap out\r\nand float into the big building the big aircraft in which Schwartzmann\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\n\"Now close the doors!\" their leader ordered. \"Leave everything as it\r\nwas!\" And to the pilot he gave added instructions: \"There iss no air\r\ntraffic here. You will to forty thousand ascend, und you will wait\r\nover this spot.\" Contemptuously he kicked aside the legs of the bound\r\nman that he might walk back into the cabin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe take-off was not as smooth as it would have been had Chet's slim\r\nhands been on the controls; this burly one who handled them now was\r\nnot accustomed to such sensitivity. But Chet felt the ship lift and\r\nlurch, then settle down to a swift, spiralling ascent. Now he lay\r\nstill as he tried to ponder the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Now what dirty work are they up to?\" he asked himself. He had seen a\r\nsullen fury on the dark face of Herr Schwartzmann as he spoke the\r\nnames of Walt and Diane into the radio. Chet remembered the look now,\r\nand he struggled vainly with the cords about his wrists. Even a\r\ndetonite pistol with its tiny grain of explosive in the end of each\r\nbullet would not check him--not when Walt and Diane were endangered.\r\nAnd the expression on that heavy, scowling face had told him all too\r\nclearly that some real danger threatened.\r\n\r\nBut the cords held fast on his swollen wrists. His head was still\r\nthrobbing; and even his side, not entirely healed, was adding to the\r\ntorment that beat upon him--beat and beat with his pulsing\r\nblood--until the beating faded out into unconsciousness....\r\n\r\nDimly he knew they were soaring still higher as their radio picked up\r\nthe warning of an approaching patrol ship; vaguely he realized that\r\nthey descended again to a level of observation. Chet knew in some\r\ncorner of his brain that Schwartzmann was watching from an under\r\nlookout with a powerful glass, and he heard his excited command:\r\n\r\n\"Down--go slowly, down!... They are landing.... They have entered the\r\nhangar. Now, down with it, Max! Down! down!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plunging fall of the ship roused Chet from his stupor. He felt the\r\njolt of the clumsy landing despite the snow-cushioned ground; he\r\nheard plainly the exclamations from beyond an open port--the startled\r\noath in Walter Harkness' voice, and the stinging scorn in the words of\r\nDiane Delacouer.\r\n\r\nHerr Schwartzmann had been in the employ of Mademoiselle Delacouer,\r\nbut he was taking orders no longer. There was a sound of scuffling\r\nfeet, and once the thud of a blow.... Then Chet watched with heavy,\r\nhopeless eyes as the familiar faces of Diane and Walt appeared in the\r\ndoorway. Their hands were bound; they, too, were threatened with a\r\nslim-barreled pistol in the hands of the smirking, exultant\r\nSchwartzmann.\r\n\r\nA tall, thin-faced man whom Chet had not seen before followed them\r\ninto the room. The newcomer was motioned forward now, as Schwartzmann\r\ncalled an order to the pilot:\r\n\r\n\"All right; now we go, Max! Herr Doktor Kreiss will give you the\r\nbearings; he knows his way among the stars.\"\r\n\r\nHerr Schwartzmann doubled over in laughing appreciation of his own\r\nsuccess before he straightened up and regarded his captives with cold\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Such a pleasure!\" he mocked: \"such charming passengers to take with\r\nme on my first trip into space; this ship, it iss not so goot. I will\r\nbuild better ships later on; I will let you see them when I shall come\r\nto visit you.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed again at sight of the wondering looks in the eyes of the\r\nthree; stooping, he jerked the gag from Chet's mouth.\r\n\r\n\"You do not understand,\" he exclaimed. \"I should haff explained. You\r\nsee, _meine guten Freunde_, we go--ach!--you have guessed it already!\r\nWe go to the Dark Moon. I am pleased to take you with me on the trip\r\nout; but coming back, I will have so much to bring--there will be no\r\nroom for passengers.\r\n\r\n\"I could have killed you here,\" he said; and his mockery gave place\r\nfor a moment to a savage tone, \"but the patrol ships, they are\r\neverywhere. But I have influence here und there--I arranged that your\r\nflask of gas should be charged with explosive, I discredited you, and\r\nyet I could not so great a risk take as to kill you all.\"\r\n\r\n\"So came inspiration! I called your foolish young friend here from the\r\nhospital. I ordered him to go at once to the ship hidden where I could\r\nnot find, and I signed the name of Herr Harkness.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet caught the silent glances of his friends who could yet smile\r\nhopefully through the other emotions that possessed them. He ground\r\nhis teeth as the smooth voice of Herr Schwartzmann went on:\r\n\r\n\"He led me here; the young fool! Then I sent for you--and this time I\r\nsigned his name--und you came. So simple!\"\r\n\r\n\"Und now we go in my ship to my new world. And,\" he added savagely,\r\n\"if one of you makes the least trouble, he will land on the Dark\r\nMoon-yess!-but he will land hard, from ten thousand feet up!\"\r\n\r\nThe great generator was roaring. To Chet came the familiar lift of the\r\nR. A. effect. They were beyond the R. A.; they were heading out and\r\naway from Earth; and his friends were captives through his own\r\nunconscious treachery, carried out into space in their own ship, with\r\nthe hands of an enemy gripping the controls....\r\n\r\nChet's groan, as he turned his face away from the others who had tried\r\nto smile cheerfully, had nothing to do with the pain of his body. It\r\nwas his mind that was torturing him.\r\n\r\nBut he muttered broken words as he lay there, words that had reference\r\nto one Schwartzmann. \"I'll get him, damn him! I'll get him!\" he was\r\npromising himself.\r\n\r\nAnd Herr Schwartzmann who was clever, would have proved his cleverness\r\nstill more by listening. For a Master Pilot of the World does not get\r\nhis rating on vain boasts. He must know first his flying, his ships\r\nand his air--but he is apt to make good in other ways as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_Out of Control_\r\n\r\nWalter Harkness had built this ship with Chet's help. They had\r\ndesigned it for space-travel. It was the first ship to leave the Earth\r\nunder its own power, reach another heavenly body, and come back for a\r\nsafe landing. But they had not installed any luxuries for the\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nIn the room where the three were confined, there were no\r\nself-compensating chairs such as the high-liners used. But the\r\nacceleration of the speeding ship was constant, and the rear wall\r\nbecame their floor where they sat or paced back and forth. Their bonds\r\nhad been removed, and one of Harkness' hands was gripping Diane's\r\nwhere they sat side by side. Chet was briskly limbering his cramped\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the two who sat silent nearby, and he knew what was in\r\ntheir minds--knew that each was thinking of the other, forgetting\r\ntheir own danger: and it was these two who had saved his life on their\r\nfirst adventure out in space.\r\n\r\nWalt--one man who was never spoiled by his millions; and\r\nDiane--straight and true as they make 'em! Some way, somehow, they\r\nmust be saved--thus ran his thoughts--but it looked bad for them all.\r\nSchwartzmann?--no use kidding themselves about that lad; he was one\r\nbad hombre. The best they could hope for was to be marooned on the\r\nDark Moon--left there to live or to die amid those savage\r\nsurroundings; and the worst that might happen--! But Chet refused to\r\nthink of what alternatives might occur to the ugly, distorted mind of\r\nthe man who had them at his mercy.\r\n\r\nThere was no echo of these thoughts when he spoke; the smile that\r\nflashed across his lean face brought a brief response from the\r\ndespondent countenances of his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Chet observed, and ran his hand through a tangle of blond\r\nhair, \"I have heard that the Schwartzmann lines give service, and I\r\nreckon I heard right. Here we were wanting to go back to the Dark\r\nMoon, and,\"--he paused to point toward a black portlight where\r\noccasional lights flashed past--\"I'll say we're going; going somewhere\r\nat least. All I hope is that that Maxie boy doesn't find the Dark Moon\r\nat about ten thousand per. He may be a great little skipper on a nice,\r\nslow, five-hundred-maximum freighter, but not on this boat. I don't\r\nlike his landings.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer raised her eyes to smile approvingly upon him. \"You're\r\ngood, Chet,\" she said; \"you are a darn good sport. They knock you down\r\nout of control, and you nose right back up for a forty-thousand foot\r\nzoom. And you try to carry us with you. Well, I guess it's time we got\r\nover our gloom. Now what is going to happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Walter Harkness, looking at his watch: \"if that\r\nfool pilot of Schwartzmann's doesn't cut his stern thrust and build up\r\na bow resistance, we'll overshoot our mark and go tearing on a few\r\nhundred thousand miles in space.\"\r\n\r\nDiane was playing up to Chet's lead.\r\n\r\n\"_Bien!_\" she exclaimed. \"A few million, perhaps! Then we may see some\r\nof those Martians we've been speculating about. I hear they are\r\nhandsome, my Walter--much better looking than you. Maybe this is all\r\nfor the best after all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" Harkness protested, \"if you two idiots don't know enough to\r\nworry as you ought, I don't see any reason why I should do all the\r\nheavy worrying for the whole crowd. I guess you've got the right idea\r\nat that: take what comes when it gets here--or when we get there.\"\r\n\r\nSmall wonder, thought Chet, that Herr Schwartzmann stared at them in\r\npuzzled bewilderment when he flung open the door, and took one long\r\nstride into the room. Stocky, heavy-muscled, he stood regarding them,\r\na frown of suspicion drawing his face into ugly lines. Plainly he was\r\ndisturbed by this laughing good-humor where he had expected misery and\r\nhopelessness and tears. He moved the muzzle of a detonite pistol back\r\nand forth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You haff been drinking!\" he stated at last. \"You are intoxicated--all\r\nof you!\" His eyes darted searching glances about the little room that\r\nwas too bare to hide any cause for inebriation.\r\n\r\nIt was Mam'selle Diane who answered him with an emphatic shake of her\r\ndark head; an engaging smile tugged at the corners of her lips. \"_Mais\r\nnon!_ my dear Herr Schwartzmann,\" she assured him: \"it is joy--just\r\nhappiness at again approaching our Moon--and in such good company,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortunes of war, Schwartzmann,\" declared Harkness; \"we know how to\r\naccept them, and we don't hold it against you. We are down now, but\r\nyour turn will come.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's reply was a sputtering of rage in words that neither Chet\r\nnor Harkness could understand. The latter turned to the girl with a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get it, Diane? What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I would not care to translate it literally,\" said Diane\r\nDelacouer, twisting her soft mouth into an expression of distaste;\r\n\"but, speaking generally, he disagrees with you.\"\r\n\r\nHerr Schwartzmann was facing Harkness belligerently. \"You think you\r\nknow something! What is it?\" he demanded. \"You are under my feet: I\r\nkick you as I would _meinen Hund_ and you can do nothing.\" He aimed a\r\nsavage kick into the air to illustrate his meaning, and Harkness' face\r\nflushed suddenly scarlet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever retort was on Harkness' tongue was left unspoken; a sharp\r\nlook from Chet, who brought his fingers swiftly to his lips in a\r\ngesture of silence, checked the reply. The action was almost\r\nunconscious on Chet's part; it was as unpremeditated as the sudden\r\nthought that flashed abruptly into his mind--\r\n\r\nThey were helpless; they were in this brute's power beyond the\r\nslightest doubt. Schwartzmann's words, \"You know something. What is\r\nit?\" had fired a swift train of thought.\r\n\r\nThe idea was nebulous as yet ... but if they could throw a scare into\r\nthis man--make him think there was danger ahead.... Yes, that was it:\r\nmake Schwartzmann think they knew of dangers that he could not avoid.\r\nThey had been there before: make this man afraid to kill them. The\r\ndreadful alternative that Chet had feared to think of might be\r\naverted....\r\n\r\nAll this came in an instantaneous, flashing correlation of his\r\nconscious thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what we mean,\" he told Schwartzmann. He even leaned\r\nforward to shake an impressive finger before the other's startled\r\nface. \"I'll tell you first of all that it doesn't make a damn bit of\r\ndifference who is on top--or it won't in a few hours more. We'll all\r\nbe washed out together.\r\n\r\n\"I've landed once on the Dark Moon; I know what will happen. And do\r\nyou know how fast we are going? Do you know the Moon's speed as it\r\napproaches? Had you thought what you will look like when that fool\r\npilot rams into it head on?\r\n\r\n\"And that isn't all!\" He grinned derisively into Schwartzmann's\r\nflushed face, disregarding the half-raised pistol; it was as if some\r\nsecret thought had filled him with overpowering amusement. His broad\r\ngrin grew into a laugh. \"That isn't all, big boy. What will you do if\r\nyou do land? What will you do when you open the ports and the--?\" He\r\ncut his words short, and the smile, with all other expression, was\r\ncarefully erased from his young face.\r\n\r\n\"No, I reckon I won't spoil the surprise. We got through it all right;\r\nmaybe you will, too--maybe!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd again it was Diane who played up to Chet's lead without a moment's\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Chet,\" she demanded, \"aren't you going to warn him? You would not\r\nallow him and his men to be--\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped in apparent horror of the unsaid words; Chet gave her an\r\napproving glance.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that when we get there, Diane.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly back to Schwartzmann. \"I'll forget what a rotten\r\nwinner you have been; I'll help you out; I'll take the controls if you\r\nlike. Of course, your man, Max, may set us down without damage; then\r\nagain--\"\r\n\r\n\"Take them!\" Schwartzmann ungraciously made an order of his\r\nacceptance. \"Take the controls, Herr Bullard! But if you make a\r\nsingle false move!\" The menacing pistol completed the threat.\r\n\r\nBut \"Herr Bullard\" merely turned to his companion with a level,\r\nunderstanding look. \"Come on,\" he said; \"you can both help in working\r\nout our location.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped before the burly man that Diane might precede them through\r\nthe door. And he felt the hand of Walt Harkness on his arm in a\r\npressure that told what could not be said aloud.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were pallid-faced men in the cabin through which they passed;\r\nmen who stared and stared from the window-ports into the black\r\nimmensity of space. Chet, too, stopped to look; there had been no\r\nport-holes in that inner room where they had been confined.\r\n\r\nHe knew what to expect; he knew how awe-inspiring would be the sight\r\nof strange, luminous bodies--great islands of light--masses of\r\nanimaculae--that glowed suddenly, then melted again into velvet black.\r\nA whirl of violet grew almost golden in sudden motion; Chet knew it\r\nfor an invisible monster of space. Glowingly luminous as it threw\r\nitself upon a subtle mass of shimmering light, it faded like a\r\nflickering flame, and went dark as its motion ceased.\r\n\r\nLife!--life everywhere in this ocean of space! And on every hand was\r\ndeath. \"Not surprising,\" Chet realized, \"that these other Earthmen are\r\nawed and trembling!\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was above them; its light struck squarely down through the\r\nupper ports. This was polarized light--there was nothing outside to\r\nreflect or refract it--and, coming as a straight beam from above, it\r\nmade a brilliant circle upon the floor from which it was diffused\r\nthroughout the room. It was as if the floor itself was the\r\nilluminating agent.\r\n\r\nNo eye could bear to look into the glare from above; nor was there\r\nneed, for the other ports drew the eyes with their black depths of\r\nunplumbed space.\r\n\r\nBlack!--so velvet as to seem almost tangible! Could one have reached\r\nout a hand, that blackness, it seemed, must be a curtain that the hand\r\ncould draw aside, where unflickering points of light pricked through\r\nthe dark to give promise of some radiant glory beyond.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had seen it before, these three, yet Chet caught the eyes of\r\nHarkness and Diane and knew that his own eyes must share something of\r\nthe look he saw in theirs--something of reverent wonder and a strange\r\nhumility before this evidence of transcendent greatness.\r\n\r\nTheir own immediate problem seemed gone. The tyranny of this glowering\r\nhuman and his men--the efforts of the whole world and its struggling\r\nmillions--how absurdly unimportant it all was! How it faded to\r\ninsignificance! And yet....\r\n\r\nChet came from the reverie that held him. There was one man by whom\r\nthis beauty was unseen. Herr Schwartzmann was angrily ordering them\r\non, and, surprisingly, Chet laughed aloud.\r\n\r\nThis problem, he realized, was _his_ problem--his to solve with the\r\nhelp of the other two. And it was _not_ insignificant; he knew with\r\nsome sudden wordless knowledge that there was nothing in all the great\r\nscheme but that it had its importance. This vastness that was beyond\r\nthe power of human mind to grasp ceased to be formidable--he was part\r\nof it. He felt buoyed up; and he led the way confidently toward the\r\ncontrol-room door where Schwartzmann stood.\r\n\r\nThe scientist, whom Schwartzmann had called Herr Doktor Kreiss, was\r\nbeside the pilot. He was leaning forward to search the stars in the\r\nblackness ahead, but the pilot turned often to stare through the rear\r\nlookouts as if drawn in fearful fascination by what was there. Chet\r\ntook the controls at Schwartzmann's order; the pilot saluted with a\r\ntrembling hand and vanished into the cabin at the rear.\r\n\r\n\"Ready for flying orders, Doctor,\" the new pilot told Herr Kreiss.\r\n\"I'll put her where you say--within reason.\"\r\n\r\nBehind him he heard the choked voice of Mademoiselle Diane:\r\n\"_Regardez! Ah, mon Dieu_, the beauty of it! This loveliness--it\r\nhurts!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne hand was pressed to her throat; her face was turned as the pilot's\r\nhad been that she might stare and stare at a quite impossible moon--a\r\ngreat half-disk of light in the velvet dark.\r\n\r\n\"This loveliness--it hurts!\" Chet looked, too, and knew what Diane was\r\nfeeling. There was a catch of emotion in his own throat--a feeling\r\nthat was almost fear.\r\n\r\nA giant half-moon!--and he knew it was the Earth. Golden Earth-light\r\ncame to them in a flooding glory; the blazing sun struck on it from\r\nabove to bring out half the globe in brilliant gold that melted to\r\nsoftest, iridescent, rainbow tints about its edge. Below, hung\r\nmotionless in the night, was another sphere. Like a reflection of\r\nEarth in the depths of some Stygian lake, the old moon shone, too, in\r\na half-circle of light.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that these celestial glories brought a gasp of delight\r\nfrom Diane, or drew into lines of fear the face of that other pilot\r\nwho saw only his own world slipping away. But Chet Bullard, Master\r\nPilot of the World, swung back to scan a star-chart that the scientist\r\nwas holding, then to search out a similar grouping in the black depths\r\ninto which they were plunging, and to bring the cross-hairs of a\r\nrigidly mounted telescope upon that distant target.\r\n\r\n\"How far?\" he asked himself in a half-spoken thought, \"--how far have\r\nwe come?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an instrument that ticked off the seconds in this seemingly\r\ntimeless void. He pressed a small lever beside it, and, beneath a\r\nglass that magnified the readings, there passed the time-tape. Each\r\nhour and minute was there; each movement of the controls was\r\nindicated; each trifling variation in the power of the generator's\r\nblast. Chet made some careful computations and passed the paper to\r\nHarkness, who tilted the time-tape recorder that he might see the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\"Check this, will you, Walt?\" Chet was asking. \"It is based on the\r\ntime of our other trip, acceleration assumed as one thousand miles per\r\nhour per hour out of air--\"\r\n\r\nThe scientist interrupted; he spoke in English that was carefully\r\nprecise.\r\n\r\n\"It should lie directly ahead--the Dark Moon. I have calculated with\r\nexactness.\"\r\n\r\nWalter Harkness had snatched up a pair of binoculars. He swung sharply\r\nfrom lookout to lookout while he searched the heavens.\r\n\r\n\"It's damned lucky for us that you made a slight error,\" Chet was\r\ntelling the other.\r\n\r\n\"Error?\" Kreiss challenged. \"Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you and I are dead right this minute,\" Chet told him. \"We are\r\ncrossing the orbit of the Dark Moon--crossing at twenty thousand miles\r\nper hour relative to Earth, slightly in excess of that figure relative\r\nto the Dark Moon. If it had been here--!\" He had been watching\r\nHarkness anxiously; he bit off his words as the binoculars were thrust\r\ninto his hand.\r\n\r\n\"There she comes,\" Harkness told him quietly; \"it's up to you!\"\r\n\r\nBut Chet did not need the glasses. With his unaided eyes he could see\r\na faint circle of violet light. It lay ahead and slightly above, and\r\nit grew visibly larger as he watched. A ring of nothingness, whose\r\noutline was the faintest shimmering halo; more of the distant stars\r\nwinked out swiftly behind that ghostly circle; it was the Dark\r\nMoon!--and it was rushing upon them!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet swung an instrument upon it. He picked out a jet of violet light\r\nthat could be distinguished, and he followed it with the cross-hairs\r\nwhile he twirled a micrometer screw; then he swiftly copied the\r\nreading that the instrument had inscribed. The invisible disk with its\r\nghostly edge of violet was perceptibly larger as he slammed over the\r\ncontrol-ball to up-end them in air.\r\n\r\nUnder the control-room's nitron illuminator the cheeks of Herr Doktor\r\nKreiss were pale and bloodless as if his heart had ceased to function.\r\nHarkness had moved quietly back to the side of Diane Delacouer and was\r\nholding her two hands firmly in his.\r\n\r\nThe very air seemed charged with the quick tenseness of emotions.\r\nSchwartzmann must have sensed it even before he saw the onrushing\r\ndeath. Then he leaped to a lookout, and, an instant later, sprang at\r\nChet calmly fingering the control.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" he screamed, \"you would kill us all? Turn away from it! Away\r\nfrom it!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw himself in a frenzy upon the pilot. The detonite pistol was\r\nstill in his hand. \"Quick!\" he shouted. \"Turn us!\"\r\n\r\nHarkness moved swiftly, but the scientist, Kreiss, was nearer; it was\r\nhe who smashed the gun-hand down with a quick blow and snatched at the\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann was beside himself with rage. \"You, too?\" he demanded.\r\n\"Giff it me--traitor!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the tall man stood uncompromisingly erect. \"Never,\" he said, \"have\r\nI seen a ship large enough to hold two commanding pilots. I take your\r\norders in all things, Herr Schwartzmann--all but this. If we die--we\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann sputtered: \"We should haff turned away. Even yet we\r\nmight. It will--it will--\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" agreed Kreiss, still in that precise, class-room voice,\r\n\"perhaps it will. But this I know: with an acceleration of one\r\nthousand m.p.h. as this young man with the badge of a Master Pilot\r\nsays, we cannot hope, in the time remaining, to overcome our present\r\nvelocity; we can never check our speed and build up a relatively\r\nopposite motion before that globe would overwhelm us. If he has\r\nfigured correctly, this young man--if he has found the true resultant\r\nof our two motions of approach--and if he has swung us that we may\r\ndrive out on a line perpendicular to the resultant--\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have,\" said Chet quietly. \"If I haven't, in just a few\r\nminutes it won't matter to any of us; it won't matter at all.\" He met\r\nthe gaze of Herr Doktor Kreiss who regarded him curiously.\r\n\r\n\"If we escape,\" the scientist told him, \"you will understand that I am\r\nunder Herr Schwartzmann's command; I will be compelled to shoot you if\r\nhe so orders. But, Herr Bullard, at this moment I would be very proud\r\nto shake your hand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet, as he extended his hand, managed a grin that was meant also\r\nfor the tense, white-faced Harkness and Diane. \"I like to see 'em\r\ndealt that way,\" he said, \"--right off the top of the deck.\"\r\n\r\nBut the smile was erased as he turned back to the lookout. He had to\r\nlean close to see all of the disk, so swiftly was the approaching\r\nglobe bearing down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt came now from the side; it swelled larger and larger before his\r\neyes. Their own ship seemed unmoving; only the unending thunder of the\r\ngenerator told of the frantic efforts to escape. They seemed hung in\r\nspace; their own terrific speed seemed gone--added to and fused with\r\nthe orbital motion of the Dark Moon to bring swiftly closer that\r\nmessenger of death. The circle expanded silently; became menacingly\r\nhuge.\r\n\r\nChet was whispering softly to himself: \"If I'd got hold of her an hour\r\nsooner--thirty minutes--or even ten.... We're doing over twenty\r\nthousand an hour combined speed, and we'll never really hit it....\r\nWe'll never reach the ground.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned this over in his mind, and he nodded gravely in confirmation\r\nof his own conclusions. It seemed somehow of tremendous importance\r\nthat he get this clearly thought out--this experience that was close\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\"Skin friction!\" he added. \"It will burn us up!\"\r\n\r\nHe had a sudden vision of a flaming star blazing a hot trail through\r\nthe atmosphere of this globe; there would be only savage eyes to\r\nfollow it--to see the line of fire curving swiftly across the\r\nheavens.... He, himself, was seeing that blazing meteor so plainly....\r\n\r\nHis eyes found the lookout: the globe was gone. They were\r\nclose--close! Only for the enveloping gas that made of this a dark\r\nmoon, they would be seeing the surface, the outlines of continents.\r\n\r\nChet strained his eyes--to see nothing! It was horrible. It had been\r\nfearful enough to watch that expanding globe.... He was abruptly aware\r\nthat the outer rim of the lookout was red!\r\n\r\nFor Chet Bullard, time ceased to have meaning; what were seconds--or\r\ncenturies--as he stared at that glowing rim? He could not have told.\r\nThe outer shell of their ship--it was radiant--shining red-hot in the\r\nnight. And above the roar of the generator came a nerve-ripping\r\nshriek. A wind like a blast from hell was battering and tearing at\r\ntheir ship.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by!\" He had tried to call; the demoniac shrieking from without\r\nsmothered his voice. One arm was across his eyes in an unconscious\r\nmotion. The air of the little room was stifling. He forced his arm\r\ndown: he would meet death face to face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lookout was ringed with fire; it was white with the terrible white\r\nof burning steel!--it was golden!--then cherry red! It was dying, as\r\nthe fire dies from glowing metal plunged in its tempering bath--or\r\nthrown into the cold reaches of space!\r\n\r\nIn Chet's ears was the roar of a detonite motor. He tried to realize\r\nthat the lookouts were rimmed with black--cold, fireless black! An\r\nincredible black! There were stars there like pinpoints of flame! But\r\nconviction came only when he saw from a lookout in another wall a\r\ncircle of violet that shrank and dwindled as he watched....\r\n\r\nA hand was gripping his shoulder; he heard the voice of Walter\r\nHarkness speaking, while Walt's hand crept over to raise the triple\r\nstar that was pinned to his blouse.\r\n\r\n\"Master Pilot of the World!\" Harkness was saying. \"That doesn't cover\r\nenough territory, old man. It's another rating that you're entitled\r\nto, but I'm damned if I know what it is.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, for once, Chet's ready smile refused to form. He stared dumbly at\r\nhis friend; his eyes passed to the white face of Mademoiselle Diane;\r\nthen back to the controls, where his hand, without conscious volition,\r\nwas reaching to move a metal ball.\r\n\r\n\"Missed it!\" he assured himself. \"Hit the fringe of the air--just the\r\nvery outside. If we'd been twenty thousand feet nearer!...\" He was\r\nmoving the ball; their bow was swinging. He steadied it and set the\r\nship on an approximate course.\r\n\r\n\"A stern chase!\" he said aloud. \"All our momentum to be overcome--but\r\nit's easy sailing now!\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed the ball forward to the limit, and the explosion-motor gave\r\nthunderous response.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_The Return to the Dark Moon_\r\n\r\nNo man faces death in so shocking a form without feeling the effects.\r\nDeath had flicked them with a finger of flame and had passed them by.\r\nChet Bullard found his hands trembling uncontrollably as he fumbled\r\nfor a book and opened it. The tables of figures printed there were\r\nblurred at first to his eyes, but he forced himself to forget the\r\nthreat that was past, for there was another menace to consider now.\r\n\r\nAnd uppermost in his mind, when his thoughts came back into some\r\napproximate order, was condemnation of himself for an opportunity that\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\n\"I could have jumped him,\" he told himself with bitter self-reproach;\r\n\"I could have grabbed the pistol from Kreiss--the man was petrified.\"\r\nAnd then Chet had to admit a fact there was no use of denying: \"I was\r\nas paralyzed as he was,\" he said, and only knew he had spoken aloud\r\nwhen he saw the puzzled look that crossed Harkness' face.\r\n\r\nHarkness and Diane had drawn near. In a far corner of the little room\r\nSchwartzmann had motioned to Kreiss to join him; they were as far away\r\nfrom the others as could be managed. Schwartzmann, Chet judged, needed\r\nsome scientific explanation of these disturbing events; also he\r\nneeded to take the detonite pistol from Kreiss' hand and jam it into\r\nhis own hand. His eyes, at Chet's unconscious exclamation, had come\r\nwith instant suspicion toward the two men.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven hours, Walt,\" the pilot said, and repeated it loudly for\r\nSchwartzmann's benefit; \"--forty-seven hours before we return to this\r\nspot. We are driving out into space; we've crossed the orbit of the\r\nDark Moon, and we're doing twenty thousand miles an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Now we must decelerate. It will take twenty hours to check us to zero\r\nspeed; then twenty-seven more to shoot us back to this same point\r\nin space, allowing, of course, for a second deceleration. The same\r\nfiguring with only slight variation will cover a return to the Dark\r\nMoon. As we sweep out I can allow for the moon-motion, and we'll hit\r\nit at a safe landing speed on the return trip this time.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet was paying little attention to his companion as he spoke. His\r\neyes, instead, were covertly watching the bulky figure of\r\nSchwartzmann. As he finished, their captor shot a volley of questions\r\nat the scientist beside him; he was checking up on the pilot's\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nChet was leaning forward to stare intently from a lookout, his head\r\nwas close to that of Harkness.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Walt,\" he whispered; \"the Moon's out of sight; it's easy to\r\nlose. Maybe I can't find it again, anyway--it's going to take some\r\nnice navigating--but I'll miss it by ten thousand miles if you say so,\r\nand even the Herr Doktor can't check me on it.\"\r\n\r\nChet saw the eyes of Schwartzmann grow intent. He reached\r\nostentatiously for another book of tables, and he seated himself that\r\nhe might figure in comfort.\r\n\r\n\"Just check me on this,\" he told Harkness.\r\n\r\nHe put down meaningless figures, while the man beside him remained\r\nsilent. Over and over he wrote them--would Harkness never reach a\r\ndecision?--over and over, until--\r\n\r\n\"I don't agree with that,\" Harkness told him and reached for the\r\nstylus in Chet's hand. And, while he appeared to make his own swift\r\ncomputations, there were words instead of figures that flowed from his\r\npen.\r\n\r\n\"Only alternative: return to Earth,\" he wrote. \"Then S will hold off;\r\nwait in upper levels. Kreiss will give him new bearings. We'll shoot\r\nout again and do it better next time. Kreiss is nobody's fool. S means\r\nto maroon us on Moon--kill us perhaps. He'll get us there, sure. We\r\nmight as well go now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet had seen a movement across the room. \"Let's start all over\r\nagain,\" he broke in abruptly. He covered the writing with a clean\r\nsheet of paper where he set down more figures. He was well under way\r\nwhen Schwartzmann's quick strides brought him towering above them.\r\nAgain the detonite pistol was in evidence; its small black muzzle\r\nmoved steadily from Harkness to Chet.\r\n\r\n\"For your life--such as is left of it--you may thank Herr Doktor\r\nKreiss,\" he told Chet. \"I thought at first you would have attempted to\r\nkill us.\" His smile, as he regarded them, seemed to Chet to be\r\nentirely evil. \"You were near death twice, my dear Herr Bullard; and\r\nthe danger is not entirely removed.\r\n\r\n\"'Forty-seven hours' you have said; in forty-seven hours you will land\r\nus on the Dark Moon. If you do not,\"--he raised the pistol\r\nsuggestively--\"remember that the pilot, Max, can always take us back\r\nto Earth. You are not indispensable.\"\r\n\r\nChet looked at the dark face and its determined and ominous scowl.\r\n\"You're a cheerful sort of soul, aren't you?\" he demanded. \"Do you\r\nhave any faint idea of what a job this is? Do you know we will shoot\r\nanother two hundred thousand miles straight out before I can check\r\nthis ship? Then we come back; and meanwhile the Dark Moon has gone on\r\nits way. Had you thought that there's a lot of room to get lost in out\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven hours!\" said Schwartzmann. \"I would advise that you do\r\nnot lose your way.\"\r\n\r\nChet shot one quizzical glance at Harkness.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" he said, \"makes it practically unanimous.\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann, with an elaborate show of courtesy, escorted Diane\r\nDelacouer to a cabin where she might rest. At a questioning look\r\nbetween Diane and Harkness, their captor reassured them.\r\n\r\n\"Mam'selle shall be entirely safe,\" he said. \"She may join you here\r\nwhenever she wishes. As for you,\"--he was speaking to Harkness--\"I\r\nwill permit you to stay here. I could tie you up but this iss not\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Harkness must have agreed that it was indeed unnecessary, for\r\neither Kreiss or Max, or some other of Schwartzmann's men, was at his\r\nside continuously from that moment on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet would have liked a chance for a quiet talk and an exchange of\r\nideas. It seemed that somewhere, somehow, he should be able to find an\r\nanswer to their problem. He stared moodily out into the blackness\r\nahead, where a distant star was seemingly their goal. Harkness stood\r\nat his side or paced back and forth in the little room, until he threw\r\nhimself, at last, upon a cot.\r\n\r\nAnd always the great stern-blast roared; muffled by the insulated\r\nwalls, its unceasing thunder came at last to be unheard. To the pilot\r\nthere was neither sound nor motion. His directional sights were\r\nunswervingly upon that distant star ahead. Seemingly they were\r\nsuspended, helpless and inert, in a black void. But for the occasional\r\nglowing masses of strange living substance that flashed past in this\r\nocean of space, he must almost have believed they were motionless--a\r\ndead ship in a dead, black night.\r\n\r\nBut the luminous things flashed and were gone--and their coming,\r\nstrangely, was from astern; they flicked past and vanished up ahead.\r\nAnd, by this, Chet knew that their tremendous momentum was unchecked.\r\nThough he was using the great stern blast to slow the ship, it was\r\ndriving stern-first into outer space. Nor, for twenty hours, was there\r\na change, more than a slackening of the breathless speed with which\r\nthe lights went past.\r\n\r\nTwenty hours--and then Chet knew that they were in all truth hung\r\nmotionless, and he prayed that his figures that told him this were\r\ncorrect.... More timeless minutes, an agony of waiting--and a\r\ndimly-glowing mass that was ahead approached their bow, swung off and\r\nvanished far astern. And, with its going, Chet knew that the return\r\ntrip was begun.\r\n\r\nHe gave Harkness the celestial bearing marks and relinquished the\r\nhelm. \"Full speed ahead as you are,\" he ordered: \"then at\r\nnineteen-forty on W.S. time, we'll cut it and ease on bow repulsion to\r\nthe limit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, despite the strangeness of their surroundings, the ceaseless,\r\nmurmuring roar of the exhaust, the weird world outside, where endless\r\nspace was waiting for man's exploration--despite the deadly menace\r\nthat threatened, Chet dropped his head upon his outflung arms and\r\nslept.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo his sleep-drugged brain it was scarcely a moment until a hand was\r\ndragging at his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven hours!\" the voice of Schwartzmann was saying.\r\n\r\nAnd: \"Some navigating!\" Harkness was exclaiming in flattering\r\namazement. \"Wake up, Chet! Wake up! The Dark Moon's in sight. You've\r\nhit it on the nose, old man: she isn't three points off the sights!\"\r\n\r\nThe bow-blast was roaring full on. Ahead of them Chet's sleepy eyes\r\nfound a circle of violet; and he rubbed his eyes savagely that he\r\nmight take his bearings on Sun and Earth.\r\n\r\nAs it had been before, the Earth was a giant half-moon; like a\r\nmirror-sphere it shot to them across the vast distance the reflected\r\nglory of the sun. But the globe ahead was a ghostly world. Its black\r\ndisk was lost in the utter blackness of space. It was a circle, marked\r\nonly by the absence of star-points and by the halo of violet glow that\r\nedged it about.\r\n\r\nChet cut down the repelling blast. He let the circle enlarge, then\r\nswung the ship end for end in mid-space that the more powerful stern\r\nexhaust might be ready to counteract the gravitational pull of the new\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAgain those impalpable clouds surrounded them. Here was the enveloping\r\ngas that made this a dark moon--the gas, if Harkness' theory was\r\ncorrect, that let the sun's rays pass unaltered; that took the light\r\nthrough freely to illumine this globe, but that barred its return\r\npassage as reflected light.\r\n\r\nBlack--dead black was the void into which they were plunging, until\r\nthe darkness gave way before a gentle glow that enfolded their ship.\r\nThe golden light enveloped them in growing splendor. Through every\r\nlookout it was flooding the cabin with brilliant rays, until, from\r\nbelow them, directly astern of the ship, where the thundering blast\r\nchecked their speed of descent, emerged a world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd, to Chet Bullard, softly fingering the controls of the first ship\r\nof space--to Chet Bullard, whose uncanny skill had brought the tiny\r\nspeck that was their ship safely back from the dark recesses of the\r\nunknown--there came a thrill that transcended any joy of the first\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nHere was water in great seas of unreal hue--and those seas were his!\r\nVast continents, ripe for adventure and heavy with treasure--and they,\r\ntoo, were his! His own world--his and Diane's and Walt's! Who was this\r\nman, Schwartzmann, that dared dream of violating their possessions?\r\n\r\nA slender tube pressed firmly, uncompromisingly, into his back to give\r\nthe answer to his question. \"Almost I wish you had missed it!\" Herr\r\nSchwartzmann was saying. \"But now you will land; you will set us down\r\nin some place that you know. No tricks, Herr Bullard! You are clever,\r\nbut not clever enough for that. We will land, yess, where you know it\r\nis safe.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the lookout, the man stared for a moment with greedy eyes; then\r\nbrought his gaze back to the three. His men, beside Harkness and\r\nDiane, were alert; the scientist, Kreiss, stood close to Chet.\r\n\r\n\"A nice little world,\" Schwartzmann told them. \"Herr Harkness, you\r\nhave filed claims on it; who am I to dispute with the great Herr\r\nHarkness? Without question it iss yours!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed loudly, while his eyes narrowed between creasing wrinkles\r\nof flesh. \"You shall enjoy it,\" he told them; \"--all your life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet, as he caught the gaze of Harkness and Diane, wondered how\r\nlong this enjoyment would last. \"All your life!\" But this was rather\r\nindefinite as a measure of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_A Desperate Act_\r\n\r\nThe ship that Chet Bullard and Harkness had designed had none of the\r\ninstruments for space navigation that the ensuing years were to bring.\r\nChet's accuracy was more the result of that flyer's sixth sense--that\r\nsame uncanny power that had served aviators so well in an earlier day.\r\nBut Chet was glad to see his instruments registering once more as he\r\napproached a new world.\r\n\r\nEven the sonoflector was recording; its invisible rays were darting\r\ndownward to be reflected back again from the surface below. That\r\nabsolute altitude recording was a joy to read; it meant a definite\r\nrelationship with the world.\r\n\r\n\"I'll hold her at fifty thousand,\" he told Harkness. \"Watch for some\r\noutline that you can remember from last time.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an irregular area of continental size; only when they had\r\ncrossed it did Harkness point toward an outflung projection of land.\r\n\"That peninsula,\" he exclaimed; \"we saw that before! Swing south and\r\ninland.... Now down forty, and east of south.... This ought to be the\r\nspot.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Harkness, too, had the flyer's indefinable power of\r\norientation. He guided Chet in the downward flight, and his pointing\r\nfinger aimed at last at a cluster of shadows where a setting sun\r\nbrought mountain ranges into strong relief. Chet held the ship steady,\r\nhung high in the air, while the quick-spreading mantle of night swept\r\nacross the world below. And, at last, when the little world was\r\ndeep-buried in shadow, they saw the red glow of fires from a hidden\r\nvalley in the south.\r\n\r\n\"Fire Valley!\" said Chet. \"Don't say anything about me being a\r\nnavigator. Wait, you've brought us home, sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home!\" He could not overcome this strange excitement of a home-coming\r\nto their own world. Even the man who stood, pistol in hand, behind him\r\nwas, for the moment, forgotten.\r\n\r\nValley of a thousand fires!--scene of his former adventures! Each\r\nfumerole was adding its smoky red to the fiery glow that illumined the\r\nplace. There were ragged mountains hemming it in; Chet's gaze passed\r\non to the valley's end.\r\n\r\nDown there, where the fires ceased, there would be water; he would\r\nland there! And the ship from Earth slipped down in a long slanting\r\nline to cushion against its under exhausts, whose soft thunder echoed\r\nback from a bare expanse of frozen lava. Then its roaring faded. The\r\nsilvery shape sank softly to its rocky bed, as Chet cut the motor that\r\nhad sung its song of power since the moment when Schwartzmann had\r\ncarried him off--taken him from that frozen, forgotten corner of an\r\nincredibly distant Earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Iss there air?\" Schwartzmann demanded. Chet came to himself again\r\nwith a start: he saw the man peering from the lookout to right and to\r\nleft as if he would see all that there was in the last light of day.\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" he was grumbling to himself. \"A strange place! But those\r\nhills--I saw their markings--there will be metals there. I will\r\nexplore; later I return: I will mine them. Many ships I must build to\r\nestablish a line. The first transportation line of space. Me, Jacob\r\nSchwartzmann--I will do it. I will haff more than anyone else on\r\nEarth; I will make them all come to me crawling on their bellies!\"\r\n\r\nChet saw the hard shine of the narrowed eyes. For an instant only, he\r\ndared to consider the chance of leaping upon the big, gloating figure.\r\nOne blow and a quick snatch for the pistol!... Then he knew the folly\r\nof such a plan: Schwartzmann's men were armed; he would be downed in\r\nanother second, his body a shattered, jellied mass.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's thoughts had come back to the matter of air; he\r\nmotioned Chet and Harkness toward the port.\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer had joined them and she thrust herself quickly between\r\nthe two men. And, though Schwartzmann made a movement as if he would\r\nsnatch her back, he thought better of it and motioned for the portal\r\nto be swung. Chet felt him close behind as he followed the others out\r\ninto the gathering dark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe air was heavy with the fragrance of night-blooming trees. They\r\nwere close to the edge of the lava flow. The rock was black in the\r\nlight of a starry sky; it dropped away abruptly to a lower glade. A\r\nstream made silvery sparklings in the night, while beyond it were\r\nwaving shadows of strange trees whose trunks were ghostly white.\r\n\r\nIt was all so familiar.... Chet smiled understandingly as he saw Walt\r\nHarkness' arm go about the trim figure of Diane Delacouer. No mannish\r\nattire could disguise Diane's charms; nor could nerve and cold courage\r\nthat any man might envy detract from her femininity. Her dark, curling\r\nhair was blowing back from her upraised face as the scented breezes\r\nplayed about her; and the soft beauty of that face was enhanced by the\r\nvery starlight that revealed it.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Walt and Diane had learned to love; what wonder that\r\nthe fragrant night brought only remembrance, and forgetfulness of\r\ntheir present plight. But Chet Bullard, while he saw them and smiled\r\nin sympathy, knew suddenly that other eyes were watching, too; he felt\r\nthe bulky figure of Herr Schwartzmann beside him grow tense and rigid.\r\n\r\nBut Schwartzmann's voice, when he spoke, was controlled. \"All right,\"\r\nhe called toward the ship; \"all iss safe.\"\r\n\r\nYet Chet wondered at that sudden tensing, and an uneasy presentiment\r\nfound entrance to his thoughts. He must keep an eye on Schwartzmann,\r\neven more than he had supposed.\r\n\r\nTheir captor had threatened to maroon them on the Dark Moon. Chet did\r\nnot question his intent. Schwartzmann would have nothing to gain by\r\nkilling them now. It would be better to leave them here, for he might\r\nfind them useful later on. But did he plan to leave them all or only\r\ntwo? Behind the steady, expressionless eyes of the Master Pilot,\r\nstrange thoughts were passing....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were orders, at length, to return to the ship. \"It is dark\r\nalready,\" Schwartzmann concluded: \"nothing can be accomplished at\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long are the days and nights?\" he asked Harkness.\r\n\r\n\"Six hours,\" Harkness told him; \"our little world spins fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then for six hours we sleep,\" was the order. And again Herr\r\nSchwartzmann conducted Mademoiselle Delacouer to her cabin, while Chet\r\nBullard watched until he saw the man depart and heard the click of the\r\nlock on the door of Diane's room.\r\n\r\nThen for six hours he listened to the sounds of sleeping men who were\r\nsprawled about him on the floor; for six hours he saw the one man who\r\nsat on guard beside a light that made any thought of attack absurd.\r\nAnd he cursed himself for a fool, as he lay wakeful and vainly\r\nplanning--a poor, futile fool who was unable to cope with this man who\r\nhad bested him.\r\n\r\nNineteen seventy-three!--and here were Harkness and Diane and himself,\r\ncaptured by a man who was mentally and morally a misfit in a modern\r\nworld. A throw-back--that was Schwartzmann: Harkness had said it. He\r\nbelonged back in nineteen fourteen.\r\n\r\nHarkness was beyond the watching guard; from where he lay came sounds\r\nof restless movement. Chet knew that he was not alone in this mood of\r\nhopeless dejection. There was no opportunity for talk; only with the\r\ncoming of day did the two find a chance to exchange a few quick words.\r\n\r\nThe guard roused the others at the first light of sunlight beyond the\r\nports. Harkness sauntered slowly to where Chet was staring from a\r\nlookout. He, too, leaned to see the world outside, and he spoke\r\ncautiously in a half-whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Not a chance, Chet. No use trying to bluff this big crook any more.\r\nHe's here, and he's safe; and he knows it as well as we do. We'll let\r\nhim ditch us--you and Diane and me. Then, when we're on our own, we'll\r\nwatch our chance. He will go crazy with what he finds--may get\r\ncareless--then we'll seize the ship--\" His words ended abruptly. As\r\nSchwartzmann came behind them, he was casually calling Chet's\r\nattention to a fumerole from which a jet of vapor had appeared.\r\nYellowish, it was; and the wind was blowing it.\r\n\r\nChet turned away; he hardly saw Schwartzmann or heard Harkness' words.\r\nHe was thinking of what Walt had said. Yes, it was all they could do;\r\nthere was no chance of a fight with them now. But later!\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer came into the control-room at the instant; her dark\r\neyes were still lovely with sleep, but they brightened to flash an\r\nencouraging smile toward the two men. There were five of\r\nSchwartzmann's men in the ship besides the pilot and the scientist,\r\nKreiss. They all crowded in after Diane.\r\n\r\nThey must have had their orders in advance; Schwartzmann merely\r\nnodded, and they sprang upon Harkness and Chet. The two were caught\r\noff their guard; their arms were twisted behind them before resistance\r\ncould be thought of. Diane gave a cry, started forward, and was\r\nbrushed back by a sweep of Schwartzmann's arm. The man himself stood\r\nstaring at them, unmoving, wordless. Only the flesh about his eyes\r\ngathered into creases to squeeze the eyes to malignant slits. There\r\nwas no mistaking the menace in that look.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I think we do not need you any more,\" he said at last. \"I think, Herr\r\nHarkness, this is the end of our little argument--and, Herr Harkness,\r\nyou lose. Now, I will tell you how it iss that you pay.\r\n\r\n\"You haff thought, perhaps, I would kill you. But you were wrong, as\r\nyou many times have been. You haff not appreciated my kindness; you\r\nhaff not understood that mine iss a heart of gold.\r\n\r\n\"Even I was not sure before we came what it iss best to do. But now I\r\nknow. I saw oceans and many lands on this world. I saw islands in\r\nthose oceans.\r\n\r\n\"You so clever are--such a great thinker iss Herr Harkness--and on one\r\nof those islands you will haff plenty of time to think--yess! You can\r\nthink of your goot friend, Schwartzmann and of his kindness to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going to maroon us on an island?\" asked Walt Harkness\r\nhoarsely. Plainly his plans for seizing the ship were going awry. \"You\r\nare going to put the three of us off in some lost corner of this\r\nworld?\"\r\n\r\nChet Bullard was silent until he saw the figure of Harkness struggling\r\nto throw off his two guards. \"Walt,\" he called loudly, \"take it easy!\r\nFor God's sake, Walt, keep your head!\"\r\n\r\nThis, Chet sensed, was no time for resistance. Let Schwartzmann go\r\nahead with his plans; let him think them complacent and unresisting;\r\nlet Max pilot the ship; then watch for an opening when they could land\r\na blow that would count! He heard Schwartzmann laughing now, laughing\r\nas if he were enjoying something more pleasing than the struggles of\r\nWalt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet was standing by the controls. The metal instrument-table was\r\nbeside him; above it was the control itself, a metal ball that hung\r\nsuspended in air within a cage of curved bars.\r\n\r\nIt was pure magic, this ball-control, where magnetic fields crossed\r\nand recrossed; it was as if the one who held it were a genie who could\r\nthrow the ship itself where he willed. Glass almost enclosed the cage\r\nof bars, and the whole instrument swung with the self-compensating\r\nplatform that adjusted itself to the \"gravitation\" of accelerated\r\nspeed. The pilot, Max, had moved across to the instrument-table, ready\r\nfor the take-off.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's laughter died to a gurgling chuckle. He wiped his eyes\r\nbefore he replied to Harkness' question.\r\n\r\n\"Leave you,\" he said, \"in one place? _Nein!_ One here, the other\r\nthere. A thousand miles apart, it might be. And not all three of you.\r\nThat would be so unkind--\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted himself to call to Kreiss who was opening the port.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he ordered; \"keep it closed. We are not going outside; we are\r\ngoing up.\"\r\n\r\nBut Kreiss had the port open. \"I want a man to get some fresh water,\"\r\nhe said; \"he will only be a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe shoved at a waiting man to hurry him through the doorway. It was\r\nonly a gentle push; Chet wondered as he saw the man stagger and grasp\r\nat his throat. He was coughing--choking horribly for an instant\r\noutside the open port--then fell to the ground, while his legs jerked\r\nawkwardly, spasmodically.\r\n\r\nChet saw Kreiss follow. The scientist would have leaped to the side of\r\nthe stricken man, whose body was so still now on the sunlit rock; but\r\nhe, too, crumpled, then staggered back into the room. He pushed feebly\r\nat the port and swung it shut. His face, as he turned, was drawn into\r\nfearful lines.\r\n\r\n\"Acid!\" He choked out the words between strangled breaths.\r\n\"Acid--sulfuric--fumes!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet turned quickly to the spectro-analyzer; the lines of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen were merged with others, and that meant an atmosphere unfit\r\nfor human lungs! There had been a fumerole where yellowish vapor was\r\nspouting; he remembered it now.\r\n\r\n\"So!\" boomed Schwartzmann, and now his squinting eyes were full on\r\nChet. \"You--you _schwein!_ You said when we opened the ports there\r\nwould be a surprise! Und this iss it! You thought to see us kill\r\nourselves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Open the port!\" he shouted. The men who held Chet released him and\r\nsprang forward to obey. The pilot, Max, took their place. He put one\r\nhand on Chet's shoulder, while his other hand brought up a\r\nthreatening, metal bar.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's heavy face had lost its stolid look; it was alive with\r\nrage. He thrust his head forward to glare at the men, while he stood\r\nfirmly, his feet far apart, two heavy fists on his hips. He whirled\r\nabruptly and caught Diane by one arm. He pulled her roughly to him and\r\nencircled the girl's trim figure with one huge arm.\r\n\r\n\"Put you _all_ on one island?\" he shouted. \"Did you think I would put\r\nyou _all_ out of the ship? You\"--he pointed at Harkness--\"and\r\nyou\"--this time it was Chet--\"go out now. You can die in your damned\r\ngas that you expected would kill me! But, you fools, you\r\nimbeciles--Mam'selle, she stays with me!\" The struggling girl was\r\nhelpless in the great arm that drew her close.\r\n\r\nHarkness' mad rage gave place to a dead stillness. From bloodless lips\r\nin a chalk-white face he spat out one sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Take your filthy hands off her--now--or I'll--\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's one free hand still held the pistol. He raised it with\r\ndeadly deliberation; it came level with Harkness' unflinching eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Schwartzmann. \"You will do--what?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet saw the deadly tableau. He knew with a conviction that gripped\r\nhis heart that here was the end. Walt would die and he would be next.\r\nDiane would be left defenseless.... The flashing thought that followed\r\ncame to him as sharply as the crack of any pistol. It seemed to burst\r\ninside his brain, to lift him with some dynamic power of its own and\r\nproject him into action.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself sideways from under the pilot's hand, out from\r\nbeneath the heavy metal bar--and he whirled, as he leaped, to face the\r\nman. One lean, brown hand clenched to a fist that started a long\r\nswing from somewhere near his knees; it shot upward to crash beneath\r\nthe pilot's out-thrust jaw and lift him from the floor. Max had aimed\r\nthe bar in a downward sweep where Chet's head had been the moment\r\nbefore; and now man and bar went down together. In the same instant\r\nChet threw himself upon the weapon and leaped backward to his feet.\r\n\r\nOne frozen second, while, to Chet, the figures seemed as motionless as\r\nif carved from stone--two men beside the half-opened port--Harkness in\r\nconvulsive writhing between two others--the figure of Diane, strained,\r\ntense and helpless in Schwartzmann's grasp--and Schwartzmann, whose\r\naim had been disturbed, steadying the pistol deliberately upon\r\nHarkness--\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" Chet's voice tore through the confusion. He knew he must grip\r\nSchwartzmann's attention--hold that trigger finger that was tensed to\r\nsend a detonite bullet on its way. \"Wait, damn you! I'll answer your\r\nquestion. I'll tell you what we'll do!\"\r\n\r\nIn that second he had swung the metal bar high; now he brought it\r\ncrashing down in front of him. Schwartzmann flinched, half turned as\r\nif to fire at Chet, and saw the blow was not for him.\r\n\r\nWith a splintering crash, the bar went through an obstruction. There\r\nwas sound of glass that slivered to a million mangled bits--the sharp\r\ntang of metal broken off--a crash and clatter--then silence, save for\r\none bit of glass that fell belatedly to the floor, its tiny jingling\r\ncrash ringing loud in the deathly stillness of the room....\r\n\r\nIt had been the control-room, this place of metal walls and of\r\nshining, polished instruments, and it could be called that no longer.\r\nFor, battered to useless wreckage, there lay on a metal table a cage\r\nthat had once been formed of curving bars. Among the fragments a metal\r\nball that had guided the great ship still rocked idly from its fall,\r\nuntil it, too, was still.\r\n\r\nIt was a room where nothing moved--where no person so much as\r\nbreathed....\r\n\r\nThen came the Master Pilot's voice, and it was speaking with quiet\r\nfinality.\r\n\r\n\"And that,\" he said, \"is your answer. Our ship has made its last\r\nflight.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes held steadily upon the blanched face of Herr Schwartzmann,\r\nwhose limp arms released the body of Diane; the pistol hung weakly at\r\nthe man's side. And the pilot's voice went on, so quiet, so hushed--so\r\ncuriously toneless in that silent room.\r\n\r\n\"What was it that you said?--that Harkness and I would be staying\r\nhere? Well, you were right when you said that, Schwartzmann; but it's\r\na hard sentence, that--imprisonment for life.\"\r\n\r\nChet paused now, to smile deliberately, grimly at the dark face so\r\nbleached and bloodless, before he repeated:\r\n\r\n\"Imprisonment for life!--and you didn't know that you were sentencing\r\nyourself. For you're staying too, Schwartzmann, you contemptible,\r\nthieving dog! You're staying with us--here--on the Dark Moon!\"\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf The Sun Died\r\n\r\n_By R. F. Starzl_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crack! Again Mich'l's fist caught him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tens of millenniums after the Death of the Sun there comes\r\na young man who dares to open the Frozen Gate of Subterranea.]\r\n\r\nBy our system of time we would have called it around 65,000 A. D., but\r\nin this cavern world, miles below the long-forgotten surface of the\r\nearth, it was 49,889. Since the Death of the Sun. That legendary sun\r\nwas but a dim racial memory, but the 24-hour day, based on its\r\nillusory travel across the sky, was still maintained by uranium\r\nclocks, by which the myriads who dwelt in the galleries and maze of\r\nthe under-world warrens regulated their lives.\r\n\r\nIn the office of the nation's central electro-plant sat a young man.\r\nHe was unoccupied at the moment. He was an example of the marvelously\r\nslow process of evolution, for, to all outward appearances he differed\r\nlittle from a Twentieth Century man. Keen intelligence sat on his\r\nfine-cut, kindly young face. In general build he was lighter, more\r\nrefined than a man of the past. Yet even the long, delicately colored\r\nrobe of mineral silk which he wore could not detract from his obvious\r\nvirility and strength.\r\n\r\nHis face flashed in a smile when a girl suddenly appeared in the\r\nmiddle of the room, materializing, so it seemed, out of nowhere. She\r\nresembled him to some extent, except that she was exquisitely\r\nfeminine, dark-haired, with a skin of warm ivory, while he was blond\r\nand ruddy. Her tinkling, silvery voice was troubled as she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Have I your leave to stay, Mich'l Ares?\"\r\n\r\nThe look of adoration he gave her was answer enough, but he answered\r\nwith the conventional formula, \"It is given.\" He rose to his feet,\r\nwalked right through the seemingly solid vision and made an adjustment\r\non a bank of dials. Then he walked through the apparition again and,\r\nstanding beside his chair, looked at her inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't forgotten, Mich'l, this is the day of the Referendum?\"\r\n\r\nMich'l smiled slightly. It would be a day of confusion in Subterranea\r\nif he should forget. As chief of the technies he was in direct charge\r\nof the tabulating machines that would, a few seconds after the vote,\r\ngive the result in the matter of the opening of the Frozen Gate. But\r\nthe girl's concern sobered him instantly. On the decision of the\r\npeople at noon depended the life work of her father, Senator Mane. And\r\nit was now nine o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure they will order the Gate opened,\" he said instantly. \"All\r\nthe technies are agreed that your father is right, that the Great\r\nCold was only another, more severe ice age--not the death of the Sun.\r\nThe technies--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust as the girl had seemingly materialized, a young man now stood\r\nbeside her. In appearance he was a picture of pride, power, arrogance,\r\nand definite danger. His hawk-like, patrician features were smiling.\r\nThis olive-skinned, dark young rival of Mich'l was Lane Mollon, son of\r\nSenator Mollon, ruthless administration leader and bitter opponent of\r\nSenator Mane's Exodus faction.\r\n\r\nLane looked at Mich'l insolently.\r\n\r\n\"Have I your leave to stay, Mich'l Ares?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is given,\" said Mich'l without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not calling on you of my own will, Mich'l,\" the apparition of\r\nyoung Mollon said contemptuously, \"but Nida had the telucid turned on\r\nas I stepped into the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's as well for you that you're not here personally,\" Mich'l replied\r\npromptly. \"The last time we met I believe I was obliged to knock you\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nLane Mollon flushed, with a sidelong glance at Nida. The girl gave\r\nMich'l a frightened look.\r\n\r\nLane interpreted her concern rightly.\r\n\r\n\"Ordinarily it's not safe to try anything like that with me. I could\r\nhave you executed in half an hour. But I don't have to call on the\r\nState to punish you. Nida, you'll admit I'm taking no unfair advantage\r\nof him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do, Lane, but--\"\r\n\r\nLane reached out his hand to the dial, invisible to Mich'l, which\r\noperated the telucid apparatus, and immediately the apparitions\r\nvanished. Mich'l looked at his own telucid, its great unwinking eye\r\nset in the wall. But he did not project his own illusory body to the\r\ngirl's home. He was a technie--one of the pitifully few trained men\r\nand women who kept the intricate automatic machinery working. On them\r\nrested the immense, stupid civilization of the caverns, and there was\r\nwork to do. Mich'l felt that on this morning of her father's greatest\r\ntrial Nida would pay scant attention to Lane.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMich'l was testing some of the controls when Gobet Hanlon came in.\r\nGobet was also a technie, and Mich'l's special friend. Like Mich'l, he\r\nwore the light robe that was universal among the civilians in the\r\nequable climate of the caverns. He walked with the light, springy step\r\nthat was somehow characteristic of the specialized class to which he\r\nbelonged, as distinguished from the languid gait of the pampered, lazy\r\npopulace. Attached to his girdle of flat chain links was a tiny\r\ncomputing machine about as large as the palm of a man's hand. For\r\nGobet did most of the mathematical work.\r\n\r\n\"You'll want me at the tabulating section?\" Gobet stated inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"It may be well,\" Mich'l smiled. \"For the first time in centuries, I\r\nbelieve, the general public is going to vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flos Entine wants to come along.\"\r\n\r\nMich'l's smile changed to a grin. He knew the pretty, willful little\r\nsweetheart of Gobet's. If she wanted to be at the tabulating plant she\r\nwould be there.\r\n\r\n\"In fact,\" Gobet confessed somewhat sheepishly, \"she is in the car.\"\r\n\r\nThe car was waiting in the gallery. It had no visible support, but\r\nhovered a few inches above the floor above one of two parallel\r\naluminum alloy strips that stretched, like the trolley tracks of the\r\nancients, throughout all the galleries. The ancients well knew that\r\naluminum is repelled by magnetism, but the race had lived in the\r\ncaverns for centuries before evolving an alloy that possessed this\r\nrepulsive power to a degree strong enough to support a considerable\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nUnder Mich'l's guidance the car moved forward silently, through\r\ninterminable busy streets with arched roofs, lined on either side with\r\ndoors that led to homes, theaters and food distributing automats.\r\nOccasionally they passed public gardens, purely ornamental, in which a\r\nfew specimens of vegetation were preserved. They passed multitudes of\r\npeople, most of them handsome with a pampered, hot-house prettiness,\r\nbut betraying the peculiar lassitude which had been sapping the\r\nenergies of this once dynamic race for millennia. Yet to-day they\r\nshowed almost eagerness. The name of Leo Mane, prophet of deliverance,\r\nwas on every tongue. And what was the Sun like? Like the great\r\nvita-lights that were prescribed by law and evaded by everyone, except\r\npossibly the technies? Those technies--they seemed to delight in work!\r\nCurious glances fell on the gliding car. Some work in connection with\r\nthe Referendum? What must one do to vote? Oh, the telucid!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArriving at Administration Circle, the car entered a vast excavation\r\nhalf a mile in diameter, possibly a thousand feet high at the dome.\r\nHere were the entrances to some of the principal Government warrens.\r\nHere also centered the streets, like radiating spokes of a wheel, on\r\nwhich many of the officials lived. Here the emanation bulbs were more\r\nfrequent than in the galleries, so that the light was almost glaring.\r\nGuards of soldier-police, the stolid, well-fed, specialized class\r\nproduced by centuries of a static civilization, were everywhere. Not\r\nin the memory of their grandparents had they done any fighting, but in\r\ntheir short, brightly colored tunics, flaring trousers and little\r\nkepis they looked very smart. Their only weapon was a small tube\r\ncapable of projecting a lethal light-ray.\r\n\r\nMich'l led his party to the audience hall. It was only a few hundred\r\nfeet in diameter. At one end was the speaker's rostrum. Senator Mane\r\nwas already there. He was tall, purposeful, but withal tired and\r\nwistful looking. His graying hair was cut at the nape of his neck,\r\nsweeping back from his swelling temples in a manner really suggestive\r\nof a mane. His large, luminous eyes lit up.\r\n\r\n\"Is it nearly time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Senator,\" Mich'l said. \"The nation will soon assemble.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have met Senator Mollon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had the pleasure,\" Mich'l acknowledged with polite irony,\r\n\"since Senator Mollon gives me practically all my orders.\"\r\n\r\nMollon acknowledged the tribute with a quick smile, without rising\r\nfrom his chair. He, too, was different from the average Subterranean\r\nin that he was forceful and aggressive, like Senator Mane. He was\r\nstill youngish looking, of powerful, blocky build. His dark hair was\r\ncarefully parted in the middle and brushed down sleekly. The Twentieth\r\nCentury had known his prototype, the successful, powerful, utterly\r\nunscrupulous politician; and in a different sphere, that type of\r\nextra-Governmental ruler which the ancients called \"gangster.\" It was\r\ncasually discussed in Subterranea that certain of the state\r\nsoldier-police were responsible for the mysterious assassinations that\r\nhad so conveniently removed most of the effective resistance to\r\nMollon's progress in the Senate. The once potent body had not held a\r\nsession in ten years: didn't dare to, a cynical and indifferent public\r\nsaid. And a strange reluctance on the part of qualified men to accept\r\nthe Presidential nomination had left that office unfilled for the past\r\nthree years. Mollon, as party dictator, performed the duties of\r\nPresident provisionally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlos, mischievous as usual, rounded her great blue eyes and gazed at\r\nMollon with an expression of rapt admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Senator,\" she thrilled, \"I think it's wonderful of you to give\r\nSenator Mane an opportunity to debate with you. You are so kind!\"\r\n\r\nMollon failed to detect any mockery, luckily for Flos. He looked at\r\nher with half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The public must be satisfied,\" he rumbled. \"Senator Mane has aroused\r\nin them great hopes. A small matter might be adjusted, but only a\r\nReferendum will satisfy them in this.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Senator, the race is going to ruin. If we could get into the Sun\r\nagain--wouldn't you want that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe there is a 'Sun',\" Mollon replied; then, with the\r\ncandor of one who is perfectly sure of himself, added:\r\n\r\n\"If Mane were right, I still couldn't permit the Frozen Gate to be\r\nopened. I can control the people for their own good, here; it might\r\nnot be possible Outside.\"\r\n\r\nA deep musical note sounded. Suddenly the myriad inhabitants of\r\nSubterranea seemed to be milling around in the room. Actually their\r\nbodies were in their dwelling cells, but their telucid images filled\r\nthe hall. By a simple adjustment of the power circuit, their images,\r\ninstead of being life size, were made only about an inch high,\r\npermitting the accommodation of the entire nation in the hall. Their\r\nmillions of tiny voices, mingling, made a sighing sound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMane rose and stepped forward, raising his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Citizens of Subterranea,\" he began in powerful, resonant tones, and\r\nthen went on to put into his address all the fervor of a lifetime of\r\nendeavor. He told them of those times in the dim past when the human\r\nrace still dwelt on the surface of the earth. Of the Sun that poured\r\nout inexhaustible floods of life and light; of the green things that\r\nwere grown, not only to look at, but for food for all living things\r\nbefore food was made synthetically out of mined chemicals. Of the\r\nworld overrun by a teeming, happy, dynamic civilization.\r\n\r\n\"Then something happened. The Sun seemed to give less light, less\r\nheat. Perhaps we ran into a cloud of cosmic dust that intercepted the\r\nSun's rays. Perhaps the cause was to be found in some change in the\r\nSun's internal structure. But the effects could not be doubted. Ice\r\nbegan to come down from the poles. Ice barriers higher than the\r\nhighest towers covered the world, wiping out all life but the most\r\nenergetic.\r\n\r\n\"Our ancestors, and many other advanced nations, began to burrow\r\ntoward the hot interior of the earth. We to-day have no idea of the\r\nlabor that went into the digging of our underground home. We are\r\nbecoming degenerate. More and more of us, even those who still use the\r\nvita-lights, are becoming pale and flabby. There are hardly enough\r\ntechnies to keep the automatic machinery in order. What will happen\r\nwhen those technies also deteriorate, and lose the will to work? For\r\ndeteriorate they must, just as Senator Mollon and his still active\r\nallies will. Just as I will, if I live long enough. There is a great\r\nforce that we never know here. It is called the cosmic ray. It never\r\npenetrates to our depth. And our vita-lights do not produce it.\"\r\n\r\nHe then spoke of the proposed Exodus, argued, pleaded, painted a rosy\r\npicture of the outer world, of a Sun come back, a world of brightness\r\nand life. At the conclusion of his speech a sigh arose from the\r\nassembled millions--a sigh of hope, of half belief. Had the vote been\r\ntaken then the Frozen Gate would have been opened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Senator Mollon was on the rostrum, holding up a square, well\r\nmanicured hand for attention. In his deep rumbling bass he tore the\r\narguments for the Exodus to shreds. With the whip of fear he drove\r\naway hope.\r\n\r\n\"If our savage ancestors lived on the inhospitable outer shell of the\r\nearth,\" he shouted, \"is that a reason for our taking that retrograde\r\nstep? Read your histories. What happened to our neighboring nation of\r\nAtlantica only a short 15,000 years ago? They did just as this man is\r\nurging--opened their outer gate. It promptly froze open, and liquid\r\nair, the remnant of what in primordial days was an outer atmosphere,\r\npoured down the tunnels. The whole nation died, and we saved ourselves\r\nonly by blasting the connecting passages between them and us with\r\nfulminite.\"\r\n\r\nA wave of fear passed over the tiny massed figures. For centuries the\r\nrace had been rapidly losing all initiative, except for those few\r\nleaders who, through superior stamina and religious devotion to the\r\nartificial sun-rays, had maintained something of their pristine\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nNow they were hysterical with fear of the unknown. Even as Mich'l Ares\r\nadjusted the parabolic antenna of the thought-receptor vote-counting\r\nmachine, he knew what the verdict would be. In a moment the vote was\r\nflashed on a screen on the ceiling: 421 in favor of the Exodus and\r\n2,733,485 against it. There was an eery cheer from the people, and\r\nthey began to dissolve like smoke. Mollon rose, bowed politely and\r\nsmilingly, and walked out to where his magnetic car awaited him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling of deep depression that Mich'l Ares went to work\r\nthe next morning. His despair was shared by the technies under him\r\nwith whom he talked. At the telestereo station he found a bitter young\r\nman broadcasting a prepared commentary on the election ordered by\r\nSenator Mollon. It was congratulatory in nature, designed to confirm\r\npopular opinion that the nation had been saved from a great\r\ncatastrophe and to glorify the principles of Mollon's party.\r\n\r\n\"... And so once more this great nation has demonstrated its ability\r\nto govern itself, to protect itself against dangerous and unsocial\r\nexperiments. The voice of the people is the voice of God. The\r\nGovernment claims for itself no credit for this momentous decision.\r\nEach citizen has done his share toward the continuation of our safety,\r\nour prosperity....\"\r\n\r\nThe young man finished the document, smiled a charming smile, and\r\nturned off the switch. Then he grimaced his disgust and lapsed into a\r\nglum meditation.\r\n\r\n\"What say, Kratz?\" Mich'l asked.\r\n\r\n\"Trouble again on the west sector. Had trouble getting power enough.\r\nGenerators ought to be overhauled.\" He made a helpless gesture.\r\n\r\n\"How about conscripting a little labor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tried it this morning. Most of the people are still in a daze from\r\nchewing too much merclite. Those that're sober are too busy preening\r\nthemselves for voting on the winning side.\"\r\n\r\nKratz informed Mich'l that Mollon had that morning given up all\r\npretense of constitutional government, had preempted the treasury, and\r\nwas consolidating his position as avowed dictator.\r\n\r\n\"He probably wanted to do that a long time,\" Mich'l commented. \"He\r\ndidn't quite dare till that Referendum yesterday gave him the real\r\nmeasure of the public. Well, I've got to be going.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMich'l took one of the small mechanical service tunnels back to his\r\noffice. This latest news had hardly affected him, so keen was his\r\ndisappointment over the defeat of the Exodus. But he wanted to be\r\nalone. He walked through vast halls full of machinery, abandoned and\r\nrusting, through dark corridors that had once roared with industrial\r\nlife. What would happen when the present overloaded machinery should\r\nbreak down; wear out? The remnants of the great technical army could\r\nhardly serve what was left. Each passing year these silent, useless\r\nhulks became more numerous. The specter of famine was stalking amid\r\nthe dusty pipes and empty vats of the chemical plants; the horrors of\r\ndarkness lurked amid the tarnished compression spheres and the long,\r\nhooded monstrosities of the power plants, inadequately served by\r\nharassed and overworked technies.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of his office Mich'l found the telucid counterpart of\r\nMila, sister of Nida Mane. She was younger than Nida, hardly more than\r\nsixteen. Her eyes were wide with terror as she sought Mich'l. Her\r\ncheeks were wet with tears, and her silken brown hair fell in careless\r\ndisarray.\r\n\r\n\"Mich'l!\" she cried, as soon as she saw him. \"Lane Mollon has taken\r\nNida!\"\r\n\r\n\"Taken her!\"\r\n\r\n\"And Father is under arrest. Lane came this morning, crazy with\r\nmerclite gum. He had four or five soldiers with him. When Nida refused\r\nto see him they broke down the door and went to her room. They dragged\r\nher out to Lane's car, and he took her to his warren near the\r\nPresidential quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"She there now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Father followed Lane's car. Guards kept him out of Lane's\r\nwarren, so he went to see Mollon. That devil only laughed at him,\r\noffered to call another Referendum. Father had a small pocket\r\nneedle-ray and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! He killed Mollon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But he managed to burn a hole through his arm. He was rushed off\r\nto one of the cells. And Mollon says he will call a Referendum to\r\ndecide Father's fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be just like that devil's sense of humor to let the people\r\ndecree their only friend's death.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"They'll do it, too!\" Mila exclaimed tragically. \"Oh, how I wish\r\nMother were alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"And each one will feel deep within him that he has done a great,\r\ncommendable and original thing!\" Mich'l added, with keen insight.\r\n\r\nMila sank to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Go to your room,\" Mich'l said, gently stern. \"Mollon and his gang\r\nhave reckoned without the technies.\" A woman's image appeared,\r\nstooping commiseratingly over Mila--a friend of the family. Mich'l\r\nordered her to care for Mila. Then, he took a deep breath. Gone was\r\nhis feeling of helpless sorrow, leaving only an overwhelming,\r\nsteadying, satisfying anger. He flung the telucid switch, barked\r\ncracking orders.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour every technical man of Subterranea was in a large\r\nstoreroom near Mich'l's office. They were mostly young, keen and\r\nalert, their skins red or brown from the actinic lights, their hair\r\nshowing more or less bleaching from the same cause. As Mich'l talked\r\nthey became intent: they listened with a cold, deadly silence that\r\nwould perhaps have made the smug millions of Subterranea quake with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nThis affront put upon the only man in the Government who could speak\r\ntheir language, who could comprehend their ideals: the peril of the\r\ngirl they all knew and loved: these things set their long-repressed\r\nresentment flaring to white heat. They were ready for desperate\r\nthings. A turn of a valve and water would thunder through the maze of\r\ngalleries; a mishap far, far down toward the earth's hot core, and\r\nsteam would rush up--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Mich'l steadied them. After all, Subterranea was their country.\r\nAnarchy was far from the technie ideals. He had a plan.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is to be done until we have Senator Mane and Nida,\" Mich'l\r\ninstructed them. \"Remember that! Do nothing until you hear from me.\r\nEach of you go to your station. Set all adjustments so that they will\r\nnot need attention for some weeks, at least. Those of you who have\r\nfamilies, tell them to be ready to move to another residence. Say\r\nnothing about any trouble--understand?\"\r\n\r\nThere were nods of assent.\r\n\r\n\"You will proceed to your posts and keep busy. When I come it'll be by\r\ntelucid. I will say nothing. I will simply wave my hand. That means\r\nyou are to take your wives, your families, your sweethearts, to\r\nSubstation No. 37X.\"\r\n\r\nThere were audible gasps.\r\n\r\n\"Not 37X!\" exclaimed one of the older men. \"Why, that's twenty miles\r\nup, near the Frozen Gate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" Mich'l smiled with tight lips. \"You men willing?\"\r\n\r\nThere was an instantaneous shout of approval. Curiously enough,\r\nseizure of the Gate by force had not occurred to any of this\r\nlaw-abiding, well-disciplined group. But Mollon's lawless seizure of\r\nthe Government had removed all inhibitions of that sort. Seizure of\r\nthe Gate would bring at one stroke the realization of the dream that\r\nthe technies had tried for generations to win by political means.\r\nSurely, when the Gate was open, and they could see the glorious,\r\nhalf-mythical Sun for themselves, the people would consent to the\r\nExodus!\r\n\r\nFor the technies, even in the bitterness of defeat, were not\r\nanti-social. They hoped and worked for the devitalized races of\r\nSubterranea, for the betterment of their condition, more than for\r\ntheir own. The technies were the fittest; they had demonstrated their\r\nability to survive unchanged under adverse condition. They would be\r\nleast helped by the Exodus. Yet they had worked for it all their\r\nlives, as had their fathers before them, out of unselfish love for\r\nhumanity. There have always been such men. Through the murk of history\r\nwe see their lives as small, steady lights, infrequent and lonely.\r\nWith the opening of the Frozen Gate suddenly a possibility, the\r\ntechnies forgot their exasperation with the stupid mob.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The Gate is guarded,\" said an elderly man dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"A small guard,\" Gobet Hanlon remarked quickly, \"and probably dazed\r\nwith merclite. Nothing to fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay away from the Gate,\" Mich'l instructed. \"Give no cause for\r\nalarm. If an emergency arises while I'm gone, see Gobet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go alone, Mich'l,\" Gobet begged. \"A few of us with ray-needles\r\ncan storm the detention cells. We can clean out Lane's warren.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might, but the Senator and Nida would be gone. The alarm would be\r\ngiven. In a few minutes there'd be a mob.\"\r\n\r\nThe technies were already dispersing eagerly. Mich'l pressed his\r\nfriend's hand, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I'll take my needle-ray, and I know every way to get around there is.\r\nAlone, I'll attract no attention. Till later, Gobet!\" And he was gone.\r\n\r\nMich'l's way was through the smaller, less frequented communication\r\npassages used principally by the technies. Occasionally he did meet\r\ncitizens, still light-headed after their election victory celebration,\r\nand lost, but he paid them no heed. He came to the ventilation center\r\nof that level.\r\n\r\nFor ages no air had entered Subterranea from the outside. All of the\r\nair had to be regularly reconditioned, and so was returned, through a\r\nsystematic network of air ducts, to a vast, central chemical plant. It\r\nwas a latter-day Cave of the Winds, where the north, south, east and\r\nwest winds of that buried empire regularly returned for a brief few\r\nminutes of play amid chemical sprays, condensers, humidifiers,\r\noxydisers, to be again dispatched to their drudgery. This hall was\r\ntruly colossal, filled to the shadowy ceilings, a thousand feet high,\r\nwith gigantic pipes, tanks, wind-turbines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe technie in charge had not yet returned, but Mich'l consulted the\r\ndistribution plan, and soon located the duct that led to Lane Mollon's\r\nwarren. In a few minutes he was running, helped along by a strong\r\ncurrent of fresh air. The map had shown the warren to be about a mile\r\naway. For the benefit of the technies who had to work there, the duct\r\nwas plainly marked; and the lighting, by infrequent emanation bulbs,\r\nwas adequate, though dim.\r\n\r\nMich'l had made no plans for a course of action after arriving at his\r\ndestination. He felt reasonably sure that if he could get into the\r\nwarren he would have a good chance to escape with Nida. In the\r\nconfusion he could hide her nearby, and perhaps effect the release of\r\nthe senator also. He had no doubt about his fate if he were caught.\r\nLane's pose of good sportsmanship having failed to impress Nida, he\r\nhad adopted simple, brutal coercion. Mich'l's fate, if caught\r\ninterfering, would be summary execution.\r\n\r\nMich'l found the grating which he sought. It bore the key number of\r\nLane's establishment. The key which would unlock it was of course in\r\nthe hands of the police; but the bars were badly corroded, and Mich'l\r\nmanaged to bend them enough to permit the passage of his body.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a small chamber, from which ducts led to all parts\r\nof the warren. These ducts were too small to permit passage of his\r\nbody, however; it would be necessary to come into the open. A small\r\nmetal door promised egress. Mich'l climbed out, and faced a surprised\r\ncook in the kitchen, engaged in flavoring synthetic food drinks.\r\nMich'l said explanatorily:\r\n\r\n\"Inspection, air service.\"\r\n\r\nThe cook did not know the regulations about keeping the air tunnels\r\nlocked. Moreover, he, like all other servants of the mighty, worked\r\nunwillingly, being conscripted. He only grunted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMich'l made a pretense of testing the air currents. Presently he\r\nstepped into one of the communicating corridors. The warren was\r\nplanned something like a house of the Surface Age, with luxuriously\r\nfurnished rooms, baths, dining halls, and all the appurtenances of\r\nwealth. Arriving at a rotunda, in the center of which was a glowing\r\nfountain, Mich'l encountered a guard. Boldly he asked him:\r\n\r\n\"Where is Mr. Mollon? I wish to see him.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\"About Nida Mane, sir? I would hardly dare.\"\r\n\r\nMich'l looked at the man sharply, but there was no hint of recognition\r\nin the stupid, phlegmatic face.\r\n\r\n\"What about Nida Mane? It is about her I wish to speak.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a slight stirring of interest in the soldier's face.\r\n\r\n\"He will be glad to see you, sir, if you bring news of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh, yes? Perhaps what I have to tell will be of no interest to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can tell him where she is he will ask no more of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"She made good her escape then?\"\r\n\r\nSlow suspicion was dawning at last.\r\n\r\n\"For one who brings news you ask a lot of questions,\" the guard\r\nremarked heavily, as his hand slipped to the needle-ray weapon at his\r\nside. \"Show your pass!\"\r\n\r\nLike a flash Mich'l was upon him, his hand at the thick throat, the\r\nother grasping the wrist. Although the soldier, like the majority of\r\nthe populace, lacked the intense vitality of the technies, he had\r\nstubborn strength, and he fought effectively in the drilled, automatic\r\nway of his kind. Mich'l was further handicapped by the necessity of\r\nmaintaining silence. One shout, and a dozen needle-rays would no doubt\r\nperforate his body with holes and slash his flesh with smoldering\r\ncuts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrunting and sweating, they fought all around the rose-colored curb of\r\nthe fountain. At last Mich'l succeeded in forcing his adversary over\r\nthe low stone, and they went over together with a resounding splash.\r\nThe straining body of the guard suddenly relaxed, and a spreading red\r\ncloud in the water disclosed that he had struck his head against the\r\nfirst of the terraces that rose in the fountain's mist-shrouded\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nUp one of the corridors a door opened, and an angry voice shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Gurka! Gurka! I'll have you in bracelets! Captain of the guard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" From another of the corridors came a sound of running feet. A\r\ncommand rang out:\r\n\r\n\"On the double!\"\r\n\r\nAn officer, followed by four soldiers, dashed around the corner and\r\nflashed by the fountain. Peering over the curb, Mich'l saw them, some\r\nhundred yards away, come to a halt before an opened door. With a\r\nthrill of exultation Mich'l recognized the tall figure of Lane Mollon,\r\nlooking like a slightly damaged satyr of the better class, for his\r\nhead was bandaged, and he was in bad humor.\r\n\r\n\"Captain!\" he stormed. \"I want you to put that damned louse in\r\nsolitary confinement for a year. Hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" Like a megaphone the long corridor carried the low,\r\nrespectful words to Mich'l's ears.\r\n\r\nLane continued to storm:\r\n\r\n\"And if you put another damned merclite-crazy blunker[1] on guard in\r\nthis place I'll have your commission. Hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Blunker--a blunderer, an oaf. Mechanical recording had\r\npreserved the language in much of its original form, but new words did\r\ncreep in.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA quick decision was necessary, and Mich'l acted without hesitation.\r\nThe guard had rolled over on his back, so that his face was out of the\r\nwater, and he was breathing with quick, painful gasps. Mich'l dragged\r\nhim up under the concealing shelter of the fountain spray, and there\r\nchanged clothes with him. In the meantime the flowing water washed\r\naway the red stain of blood. When the captain returned with his guard,\r\nMich'l was lying realistically in the pool, apparently deep in drugged\r\nsleep, the little kepi tilted rakishly over his face.\r\n\r\nHe was roughly seized and dragged out of the water to the\r\naccompaniment of much cursing. A fist crashed into his face.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the soldiers felt the supine figure under their hands explode\r\ninto energy. Elbows and fists seemed to fly from all directions at\r\nonce. A needle-ray appeared, and before they could draw their own\r\nweapons they were howling with pain as searing welts drew over their\r\nbodies. With one accord they plunged into the pool. Only the officer\r\nremained, and he fell to the mosaic floor, his weapon half raised, the\r\nsmall black hole in his chest giving off a burnt odor.\r\n\r\nMich'l appropriated the officer's brassard of rank, and, menacing the\r\ncowed guards, forced them to herd into a nearby room, carrying the\r\nbody of the officer with them. Mich'l locked the door and looked\r\naround. He saw no one observing him, and could count on carrying a\r\npretty good bluff in his uniform, which was rapidly shedding its\r\nwater. With a firm step Mich'l walked to Lane Mollon's door, threw it\r\nopen, and entered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLane sat up on his couch, his feet striking the floor with an angry\r\nthump. But when he recognized Mich'l he paled slightly.\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\" Mich'l demanded roughly, \"before I burn you down!\"\r\n\r\n\"You said once,\" Lane began sneeringly, \"that you wanted to fight me.\r\nNow, if you'll just put down that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now,\" Mich'l dissented with deadly coldness. \"Where is Nida?\r\nSpeak fast.\"\r\n\r\nLane did so.\r\n\r\n\"She isn't here. The little short[2] crowned me with a chair, and\r\nslipped out. How did I--\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Short--trouble-maker, spitfire. A colloquialism probably\r\ngrowing out of the once frequently used electrical term\r\n\"short-circuit.\"]\r\n\r\n\"When? Hurry up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly an hour ago. She walked down the corridor, showed a\r\nthick-witted guard my own executive pass, and got away. But I got that\r\nguard--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind what you did to the guard--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the image of an officer strange to Mich'l stood in the room\r\nand saluted smartly.\r\n\r\n\"Has Captain Ilgen Mr. Lane Mollon's leave to stay?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nMollon started forward, but before he could disclose his predicament\r\nMich'l had sidled over to him and thrown one arm affectionately over\r\nhis shoulder. In his hand, concealed by the rich folds of Lane's robe,\r\nMich'l held his needle-ray, and it was pressed firmly against Lane's\r\nribs.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mollon will be glad to hear you,\" Mich'l said smoothly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe fancied that the eyes of the officer's image dilated slightly, but\r\nit lost none of its military rigor. But some explanation of his\r\npresence there in his still damp uniform must be given Ilgen, so he\r\ngrowled, in a voice that he tried to make a bit thick, as if he had\r\nchewed too much merclite:\r\n\r\n\"At ease, Captain. At ease! Damn it man, you don't have to be so\r\ndamned military. You're among friends!\" And he towseled Lane's dark\r\nhair affectionately.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ilgen looked his disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said to Lane, \"we recaptured Nida Mane as she tried to board\r\na public car near the Executive Mansion.\"\r\n\r\nThe black lens at the end of Mich'l's needle-ray pressed hard, and\r\nLane said naturally:\r\n\r\n\"You have her in custody?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we have.\" And to Mich'l's dismay, Nida, defiant, her lovely form\r\nhalf revealed by rents in her garments, seemed to materialize beside\r\nthe officer. Her wrathful eyes were fixed on Lane, and then she saw\r\nMich'l.\r\n\r\nThe technie put all his will into the pleading stare which he\r\nreturned, and she understood. She gave no sign of recognition, but\r\nfavored both Lane and Mich'l equally with the chill of her disdain.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, what are your orders?\"\r\n\r\nLane glanced aside at Mich'l, acutely conscious of the lethal pressure\r\nin his ribs.\r\n\r\n\"'Sall right with me, old fellow,\" Mich'l squawked good-humoredly.\r\n\"This your girl that got away from you? Let's both go over and bring\r\nher back.\"\r\n\r\nLane nodded assent. The soldier saluted, and his vision and that of\r\nthe girl disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"And we're going to do just that!\" Mich'l added in an entirely changed\r\nvoice. \"Get up, you. Act right, speak right, do right, and you may\r\nlive to see another day.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the two left the warren in apparent amity, and walked the beautiful\r\nstreet, with its richly formed, brightly colored arches, its seemingly\r\nillimitable vistas, its luxuriant, pampered decorative vegetation, its\r\nblazing lights--until at last they came to Administration Circle, and\r\nentered the ponderous gates behind which lay the very heart of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThey were challenged at once. Although the officer of the guard knew\r\nLane, usage required the showing of the daily pass. Many high officers\r\nof the Government had in years past fallen from grace overnight.\r\n\r\nThis formality complied with, Lane and Mich'l, the latter with his\r\nray-needle ever ready, sat down to wait in the guard room. And Lane,\r\nunder Mich'l's quiet prompting, ordered that Nida and her father be\r\nbrought to him.\r\n\r\n\"We shall bring the girl, yes,\" the astonished officer protested, \"but\r\nnot Senator Mane. He is a prisoner of state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you don't know, Captain,\" Mich'l suggested smoothly, \"that it\r\nis not wise to disregard the orders of the Provisional President's\r\nson?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would cost me my commission, perhaps my life!\" the officer said.\r\n\r\n\"Neither would be worth much if you disobey!\" Mich'l countered, a wire\r\nedge creeping into his voice.\r\n\r\nThe officer looked into Lane's stormy face, then with great reluctance\r\nretreated to carry out the order.\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes he was back, with four guards and his prisoners.\r\nHe explained that Captain Ilgen was detained on official duty.\r\n\r\n\"You may go,\" said Lane, prompted by a jab in the ribs.\r\n\r\n\"A written receipt, please, sir, for the senator.\"\r\n\r\nGlowering, Lane wrote out the desired document. At last they were\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\"Our program,\" Mich'l announced briskly, \"is simple. You will conduct\r\nus to one of the Government cars, and will ride with us to such places\r\nas we may direct, and I shall release you when it pleases me. If you\r\nthen want to fight, I will accommodate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would be willing to fight you, as head of the technies,\" Lane\r\ncountered sullenly, \"but I wouldn't be bothered with a rebel and a\r\ntraitor. You've overstepped yourself this time, my fine bolthead, and\r\nall I ask is a front seat at your execution!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey stepped into the brightly lighted hall, and in that instant\r\nMich'l felt a searing heat on his shoulder. Without a moment's pause\r\nhe hurled Senator Mane and the girl back into the room. At the same\r\nmoment he flung an arm around Lane's neck and pulled him back into the\r\ndoorway, where he could use him as a shield while he cautiously peered\r\nout into the corridor. His shoulder throbbed painfully, but his\r\nmovement had prevented the needle-ray from penetrating deeply in any\r\none place.\r\n\r\nA short distance up the corridor was a wider space, in the center of\r\nwhich stood a large bronze urn filled with exotic plants. Behind this\r\nurn were several soldiers, and Mich'l recognized the sharp-eyed\r\nCaptain Ilgen. So that officer had recognized the true state of\r\naffairs, or had strong suspicions! But in his haste and eagerness he\r\nhad overlooked one important fact. In the guardroom, were riot-rays,\r\nheavy replicas of the ordinary hand weapons. They had not been needed\r\nfor many years, but the technies had always kept them fully charged\r\nand in order.\r\n\r\n\"Nida!\" Mich'l called, not removing his eye from the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" She was standing beside him, and Mich'l thrilled to the\r\nadmiration and positive affection in her intonation.\r\n\r\n\"Notice those short tubes mounted on light wheels over against the\r\nwalls? Those are riot-ray projectors. Wheel me over a couple.\"\r\n\r\nNida did as directed. Mich'l stuck the stubby muzzle of one of the\r\nnearest weapons into the corridor, pulled the lever and swung the ray\r\nin an arc toward the ambushed soldiers. There was a sharp crackling\r\nnoise and the heat chipped myriads of flakes off the stone walls,\r\nleaving a gray path across the rich murals, and the air was filled\r\nwith flying particles. The heat was terrific. It beat back into the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ilgen gave a short, sharp order, and he and his men retreated\r\nbefore the bronze urn began to wilt and drip melted metal. He could\r\nnot be accused of cowardice, for his hand weapons were puny compared\r\nto the riot-rays.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, before he gets in touch with the outer guard!\" Mich'l urged\r\nhis prisoner forward, Senator Mane following. The grave patriarch of\r\nrhetoric made a striking picture as he dragged the second riot-ray\r\nalong. The other one was abandoned, locked with full power on. It was\r\nconverting that corridor into an inferno, and there would be no\r\npursuit through that avenue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMich'l pushed open the metal door suddenly. Two guards on duty were\r\njust coming in, their hand weapons ready. They never knew what struck\r\nthem for there was no time for compunction. But even as their bodies\r\nsank to the paving there was the harsh clangor of alarm bells.\r\nSoldiers dashed from everywhere and came running, their needle-rays\r\nmenacing.\r\n\r\n\"In there!\" Mich'l shouted. He pointed to the doors, at the dead\r\nguards. As they hesitated, he added:\r\n\r\n\"Revolution! They're storming the President's office! Hear the rays?\"\r\n\r\nThrough the doors came a faint humming, an acrid smell of heat, of\r\nstone and metal fumes. A corporal saluted Mich'l, recognized Lane's\r\nhaggard features, and Lane again felt that cogent persuader in his\r\nribs.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Corporal!\" he said bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Is the guard room occupied, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now, you fool!\" Mich'l snapped at him. This resolved the last of\r\nthe corporal's misgivings. Giving an order, he led his men in,\r\ngasping.\r\n\r\n\"Now we'll run!\" Mich'l ordered, giving Lane a shove. \"Coming, Nida?\"\r\nShe was dragging her father along joyously. They crossed the broad\r\npedestrian walk, and in the street found an official car nestling on\r\none of the tracks.\r\n\r\n\"Heave in the riot-ray, will you, old fellow?\" Mich'l requested\r\njovially, and Lane did. Then the listless chauffeur turned a\r\ncontroller, and the big car rose a few inches, lightly as a feather,\r\nand sped away swiftly through the maze of traffic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSometime later they were in a service lift; not one of the great\r\npublic lifts that carried their hundreds at a trip, but one of the\r\nsmall lifts used mostly by the technies, and known to few outside\r\ntheir ranks. Mich'l, standing blissfully close to Nida and her father,\r\nenjoyed his moment of relaxation. Many things had been attended to.\r\nLane had been released at last, in one of the catacomb cemeteries. It\r\nwould take him at least two hours to find his way out. They were\r\ndiscussing the riot-ray, which they had with them.\r\n\r\n\"I hope we won't have to exhaust it in a fight before we get out,\"\r\nSenator Mane said anxiously. \"It would be a splendid weapon if we\r\nencounter a hostile environment Outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Gate is guarded,\" Mich'l said practically, \"but we expect to\r\nsurprise them. No use worrying.\"\r\n\r\nThe lift came to a stop at an air-lock. The great elevator shafts\r\nwere closed by airlocks every 2,000 feet. The reason is obvious. If\r\nthe air of the great, spheroid subterranean nation were allowed to\r\nfreely obey the laws of gravity, it would be oppressively dense in the\r\nlower levels, and excessively rarified in the upper ones. While the\r\nairlocks were operating Mich'l stepped to a telucid and gave the\r\nagreed-on signal.\r\n\r\nIn another half hour they were at 37X. The great, dusty, and\r\nlittle-used storeroom was only poorly lighted; it was dank, and had an\r\nuncomfortable chill. Technies and their families were coming in from\r\nall sides, and it was not long before some five hundred persons, men,\r\nwomen and children, were assembled. Many of them were pale and\r\nfrightened looking, for they were staking everything on an ideal, a\r\ntheory. There would be no coming back. The statute books of\r\nSubterranea decreed only one penalty--death--for even the merest\r\ntampering with the Frozen Gate. It was not like this that they had\r\nvisioned the opening of the Gate. Under properly controlled\r\nconditions, it would have been possible to open the gate for\r\npreliminary explorations. But not now. They were outside the law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNida, standing beside Mich'l, shivered and pulled her over-robe closer\r\naround her. There was sadness in her voice as she said:\r\n\r\n\"These children.... They remind me of the thousands of children we\r\nmust abandon with our people. If I could, I'd steal a few to take with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nMich'l grinned without mirth.\r\n\r\n\"And be damned as a kidnapper of a particularly horrible sort, as long\r\nas Subterranea lasts!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I know. But what will happen to them all when the automatic\r\nmachinery fails?\"\r\n\r\n\"They may learn to run it, if they have to. Or if we succeed in\r\nestablishing ourselves in the outer world we can tunnel back to them\r\naround the Gate in a year or so. Don't worry about them too much.\r\nWe're taking the big risk, not they.\"\r\n\r\nGobet Hanlon, accompanied by Flos Entine and Mila Mane, approached. He\r\nwas loaded down with a huge case of concentrated food.\r\n\r\n\"I've given orders to bring with us all the cold resisting fabrics we\r\ncould carry. Got 'em loaded down, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"All here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every last one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go, then.\" Mich'l stepped to a small door that led into the\r\nmain corridor close to the Gate. This door had not been used by the\r\ntechnies when assembling. Through a tiny hole the guard, four\r\nsoldiers, could be seen about a blanket, tossing sixteen-sided dice.\r\nMich'l opened the door, his needle-ray pointed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't move, or you burn!\" he commanded harshly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe guards, taken completely by surprise, did not move. In a few\r\nmoments they were bound, gagged, and dumped into a corner of 37X.\r\nEager technies were swarming over the complicated mechanism that they\r\nhad dared to touch, before, only for inspection and maintenance. The\r\nFrozen Gate was like a huge stopper in a bottle, made of chromium\r\nsteel. It was thirty feet in diameter, and thirty feet thick from its\r\nwell insulated inside face to that enigmatical Outside that had been a\r\ngrisly mystery to the race for some five hundred centuries.\r\n\r\nThere was a flash of sparks, and the quiet hum of motors. With a\r\nshuddering groan the great plug freed itself from the grip of\r\nmillennia; turned a few inches in its hole. The supporting gimbals\r\ntook the load now, and slowly the great mass moved inward, carried by\r\nan overhead traveling crane whose track was bolted to the rock roof.\r\nThe rate of movement was slow, not much over three or four inches a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nAn excited murmur filled the cavern--almost hysterical joy. But\r\nMich'l, watching that widening margin for the dreaded gush of liquid\r\nair, only trembled with relief. At least the calamity that had visited\r\nrash Atlantica would not be repeated here.\r\n\r\nA young technie, one of the heat distributors, climbed up the heavy\r\nbosses on the gateway's face.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to be the first to see the Sun!\" he shouted joyously. His\r\nchallenging gaze roved over the waiting crowd, and suddenly his face\r\nturned ashen. For at the turn of the corridor, some hundred yards\r\naway, he had seen men. No mistaking those uniforms; they were\r\nsoldiers. And Mich'l, following his gaze, saw a riot-ray being wheeled\r\ninto place. His own riot-ray already commanded the corridor, but he\r\ndared not use it. The soldiers, under the partial protection of the\r\nturn, could incinerate the helpless technies with little danger to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" Mich'l shouted, running into the open.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn officer came to meet him. He then recognized Captain Ilgen, whose\r\nexceptional shrewdness had almost undone him before. Ilgen could not\r\nsee the slow movement of the gate, and Mich'l, himself weaponless,\r\ncounted only on parleying for time.\r\n\r\nThey met midway between the two forces, and the small black lens of\r\nthe captain's weapon pointed steadily at Mich'l's chest.\r\n\r\n\"Mich'l Ares, I arrest you.\" It seemed that the captain's fine gray\r\neyes looked out of the lean face with real sympathy. \"It may be there\r\nwill be executive clemency for these people of yours, but for you--\"\r\n\r\nMich'l, tense and deadly, saw the captain's vigilant attention leave\r\nhis face for a second; saw his eyes widen in consternation. He could\r\nnot know that Ilgen had seen a slender crescent of green light appear\r\nin the Frozen Gate, but he did not lose the opportunity. His fist\r\ncrashed on the captain's jaw, so that the soldierly figure reeled and\r\nthe needle-ray fell to the ground. Mich'l leaped after him, picked him\r\nup, held him. The riot-ray was turned full on him, and a soldier's\r\nhand trembled on the lever. But it did not pull.\r\n\r\n\"You'll kill him!\" Mich'l shouted. And then he ventured to turn his\r\nhead to look at the Gate. He saw the first of the fugitives struggle\r\ninto the narrow crack. The gate seemed to have stuck, and there was\r\nbarely room to pass. Ilgen, half conscious, was trying to rain blows\r\non Mich'l's back, compelling him to stop and pass the officer's hands\r\nthrough the belt of his tunic and to manacle them with a pair of\r\nbracelets which he found in his pocket. As he staggered toward the\r\nGate with his burden, he saw Gobet beside him, the stolen riot-ray\r\nmenacing the soldiers, who would otherwise have rushed in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ilgen struggled upright.\r\n\r\n\"Fire,\" he commanded in stentorian tones.\r\n\r\n\"They'll kill you too, you fool!\" Mich'l exclaimed angrily.\r\n\r\n\"I am a soldier!\" Ilgen answered with contempt. His legs barely\r\nsupported his weight, and he was struggling to free his manacled\r\nhands. He threw himself into the narrow crevice of the Gate, to\r\nobstruct the stream of fugitives. He started to shout again:\r\n\r\n\"Fi--\" Crack! Again Mich'l's fist caught him. He hooked the officer's\r\nelbows over two of the bosses, so that he was supported in plain sight\r\nof his men, and turned to urge haste. The last two stragglers were\r\nhurrying through, and with relief Mich'l turned to follow. But he set\r\nthe closing mechanism in motion before he leaped for the narrow\r\nopening that was becoming still narrower, though very slowly. Now for\r\nthat green crescent of light, and hope!\r\n\r\nHe felt a wave of heat. Glancing back, he saw the irresolute guards\r\nscattered by the enraged charge of a square, blocky man in civilian\r\nrobe--the usually smiling Provisional President, Senator Mollon.\r\nMollon himself was fumbling with the lever of the riot-ray. Ilgen had\r\nevidently reported where he was going before starting in pursuit of\r\nthe technies.\r\n\r\nAgain that withering flash of heat, and Mich'l saw Captain Ilgen,\r\nstill semi-conscious, suddenly turn red-faced. Mollon would burn him\r\nup without compunction, in the hope of catching one of the fugitive\r\ntechnies. And now a figure in uniform leaped forward at Mollon's angry\r\ngesture, and bent purposefully to the sighting tube.\r\n\r\nThe crescent was now so slender that Mich'l had to turn sideways to\r\nsqueeze back into the corridor. And slowly, inexorably, it was growing\r\nsmaller still. With desperate haste the practiced, uniformed man was\r\nadjusting his range.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ilgen struggled when Mich'l seized him.\r\n\r\n\"I arrest--\"\r\n\r\nMich'l thought for a sickening moment that he was caught in the\r\nclosing gate. Then he was free in the cylindrical tunnel into which\r\nthe plug was creeping. Luckily, Ilgen was slight. His body squeezed\r\nthrough with little more difficulty than Mich'l's own. Now the opening\r\nwas too small for any man's body. A red glow illuminated that\r\nnarrowing slit; an acrid wave of heat, and the smell of burnt metal\r\ncame with the strong current of air that blew out of Subterranea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMich'l dragged his captive down the rocky tunnel, the floor of which\r\ndipped gently away from the Gate; for drainage, no doubt. Around a\r\nbend, the source of the greenish light was apparent. The fugitives\r\nwere in an ice cavern. The light seemed to emanate from roof and\r\nwalls. The air was uncompromisingly chill, for the blast of warm air\r\nfrom Subterranea had stopped.\r\n\r\nBut the cold of the air was nothing to the icy chill that settled on\r\nthe heart of Mich'l Ares, and the hearts of Senator Mane, and the\r\nother leaders of this desperate enterprise. So this, this was the\r\nOutside! A cavern of ice--small, hemmed-in! Those ancient folk-legends\r\nof a Sun--\r\n\r\n\"I arrest you, Mich'l Ares!\"\r\n\r\nMich'l laughed shortly. What a single-minded fellow this Captain Ilgen\r\nwas! Still groggy, of course. Didn't know where they were. He left the\r\nsoldier with the red, blistered face.\r\n\r\n\"Mich'l! Mich'l!\" a voice echoed shrilly from the ice walls. It was a\r\nhigh-pitched voice, and an excited one. A boy came flying out of a\r\nnarrow crevice, his short robe flying, his cloth-wrapped legs\r\ntwinkling.\r\n\r\n\"Mich'l!\" he shouted. \"I saw it! I saw the Sun, the beautiful Sun!\"\r\n\r\nLucky it was that in the rush no one was hurt. The small cleft opened\r\ninto a wide tunnel, a low-roofed cave through which milky-white water\r\nflowed. The cave opened upon a vista of blue sky and towering\r\nmountains whose tops were burdened with snow and upon whose sides\r\nglaciers slid down and melted; and the milky-white stream brawled down\r\ninto a green valley, far, far below. On a mountain meadow, not far\r\nfrom the glacier that still buried the Frozen Gate, they rested....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so came a new strain of humanity upon the surface of the earth--a\r\nstrain tempered and refined by the inexorable process of evolution and\r\nenvironment. Already animal life had reappeared, drastically changed\r\nand ruthlessly weeded out by the most severe Ice Age the world had\r\never known, and now Man stood once more on a new threshold of time.\r\n\r\nSomething of this may have passed through the minds of the refugees\r\nluxuriating in the strong sunlight of this mountain meadow, and in\r\nactive and alert brains the foundations of a new civilization were\r\nalready being built.\r\n\r\nThey were preparing to go into the valley below when there was a dull\r\nconcussion. The glacier over the Frozen Gate rose slightly, then\r\ndisappeared completely out of sight, leaving a yawning hole in the\r\nmountainside. Ice and rocks slid down, filling the hole. The refugees\r\ngazed at the scene in fear and wonder.\r\n\r\n\"They have blown up the gate! And the chambers leading to it!\" Senator\r\nMane--now only Leo Mane--said slowly. \"There goes our last chance to\r\nsave them!\" His tones were deeply sad. He could not look upon these\r\npeople as an experiment that Nature had abandoned, although he knew\r\nthat history is thronged with the shadows of vanished races, culled by\r\nthe process of natural selection.\r\n\r\nBut Youth looks only ahead. The majority of the rescued technies were\r\nyoung, and with eagerness and anticipation, they followed Mich'l and\r\nNida Ares down into the valley to build their first homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Midget From the Island\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE NOVELETTE\r\n\r\n_By H. G. Winter_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"For God's sake, Hagendorff, what's come over you?\"_]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Garth Howard, prey to half the animals of the forest,\r\nfights valiantly to regain his lost five feet of size.]\r\n\r\nIn the chill of an early morning, a rowboat drifted aimlessly down the\r\nDetroit River. It seemed to have broken loose from its mooring and\r\nbeen swept away; its outboard motor was silent and it swung in slow\r\ncircles as the currents caught at it. But the boat carried a\r\npassenger. A man's nude body stretched face downward in it.\r\n\r\nIt was a startling figure that lay there. The body was fully matured\r\nand had a splendid development of rounded muscles--and yet it was not\r\nmore than three feet in length. A perfectly formed and proportioned\r\nmanikin! The two officers in the harbor police launch which presently\r\nslid alongside to investigate were giants in comparison.\r\n\r\nThey had not expected to find such weird cargo in a drifting rowboat.\r\nThey stared at the naked, unconscious midget in utter amazement, as if\r\nseeing a thing that could not be real. And when one of them reached\r\ndown to lift the tiny body aboard, his eyes went wider with added\r\nsurprise. His lift was inadequate. The dwarf's weight was that of a\r\nnormal-sized man!\r\n\r\nThis was mystery on mystery. But they got the uncannily heavy figure\r\naboard at last and ascertained that, though the skin showed many\r\nwounds and was blue from long exposure, the heart was still beating.\r\nAnd realizing that the life might flicker out beneath their eyes\r\nunless they took action immediately, they proceeded to work over him.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes, the dwarf gave signs of returning consciousness.\r\nHis lids fluttered and opened, disclosing eyes that filled suddenly\r\nwith terror as they stared into the faces, huge in comparison, that\r\nleaned over his. One of the officers said reassuringly:\r\n\r\n\"You're all right, buddy: you're on a harbor police launch. But who in\r\nthe devil are you? D'you speak English? Where'd you come from?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe midget struggled to speak; struggled desperately to tell something\r\nof great importance. They bent closer. Gasping, high-pitched words\r\ncame to their ears, and the story that those words told held them\r\nspellbound. When the shrill voice ceased and the dwarf sank back into\r\nthe coat they had thrown around him, the two policemen gazed at each\r\nother. One whistled softly, and his companion said soberly:\r\n\r\n\"We'd better phone up and have the local police tend to this right\r\naway, Bill.\"\r\n\r\nThus, two hours later, several miles up the river, another launch\r\ncontaining three officers came to its destination, a solitary,\r\nthickly-wooded island that brooded under a cloak of silence where the\r\nriver leaves broad Lake St. Clair. The launch crept up to a mooring\r\npost a few feet from a small, rough beach, and was tied there.\r\nQuickly, the men waded ashore and tiptoed up a winding trail that was\r\nbarred from the sun by dank foliage. They soon came to a clearing\r\nwhere a large cabin had been built. There, one of them whispered,\r\n\"Guns out!\"\r\n\r\nThen the three men crossed the clearing and cautiously entered the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was silence. Then came a terrified shout, followed\r\nby the bunched thunder of a succession of pistol shots. The\r\nreverberations slowly died away, and some time later the policemen\r\nreappeared and stood outside the door.\r\n\r\nOne of them, dazed, kept repeating over and over, \"I wouldn't have\r\nbelieved it! I wouldn't have believed it!\" and another nodded in\r\nwordless agreement. The third, white-faced, stared for a long time\r\nunseeingly at the cloud-flecked bowl of the sky....\r\n\r\nBut it would be best, perhaps, to tell the story as it happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe incredible events that shaped it began two nights before, when the\r\nlarger of the two rooms in the island cabin was bathed in the bald\r\nglare of a strong floodlight that threw into sharp prominence the\r\nintent features of two men in the room, and the complicated details of\r\nthe strange equipment around them.\r\n\r\nGarth Howard, the younger of the two, was holding a tiny, squawling,\r\nspitting thing, not more than three inches long, which might have\r\nseemed, at a quick glance, to have been a normal enough kitten. Closer\r\ninspection, however, would have revealed that it had a thick, smooth\r\ncoat, a lithe, fully developed body and narrowed, venomous\r\neyes--things which no week-old kitten ever possessed. It was a mature\r\ncat, but in the size of a kitten.\r\n\r\nHoward's level gray eyes were held fascinated by it. When he spoke,\r\nhis words were hushed and almost reverent.\r\n\r\n\"Perfect, Hagendorff!\" he said. \"Not a flaw!\"\r\n\r\n\"The reduction has not improved her temper,\" Hagendorff articulated\r\nprecisely. His deep voice matched the rest of him. Garth Howard's\r\nclean-muscled body stood a good six feet off the floor, yet the other\r\ntopped him by inches. And his face compared well with his bulky body,\r\nfor his head was massive, with overhanging brows and a shaggy mop of\r\nblond hair. Athlete and weight-lifter, the two looked, but in reality\r\nthey were scientist and assistant, working together for a common end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room in which they stood was obviously a laboratory. Bulky gas\r\nengines and a generator squatted at one end; tables held racks of\r\ntools and loops of insulated wiring and jars of various chemicals. One\r\nlong table stretched the whole length of the room, placed flush\r\nagainst the left wall, whose rough planking was broken by a lone\r\nwindow. There were racks of test tubes on this table, and tools,\r\ncarelessly scattered by men intent on their work.\r\n\r\nStill another table was devoted to several cages, containing the usual\r\nmartyrs of experimental science: guinea pigs and rabbits, rats and\r\nwhite mice. Beside these was a large box, screen topped, in which, in\r\nseparate partitions, were a variety of insects: beetles and flies and\r\nspiders and tarantulas.\r\n\r\nBut the thing that dominated the laboratory was the machine on the\r\nlong table against the wall. Its chamber, the most striking feature,\r\nwas a cube of roughly six feet, built of dull material resembling\r\nbakelite. Wires trailed through it from the glittering plate, which\r\nwas the chamber's floor, and a curved spray-shaped projector overhead,\r\nto an intricately constructed apparatus studded with vacuum tubes. A\r\nsmall switchboard stood beside the chamber, and from it thick cables\r\nled to the generator in the rear of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Let us return her to normal,\" Hagendorff rumbled after a moment or\r\ntwo devoted to prodding and examining the diminutive cat. \"Then for\r\nthe final experiment.\"\r\n\r\nOne whole wall of the cubical chamber was a hinged door, with a tier\r\nof several peep-holes. Garth Howard swung the door open, placed the\r\ntiny, struggling cat inside and quickly closed it again. \"Right,\" he\r\nsaid briefly, and pressed his eyes to the bottom peep-hole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA switch was pulled over, and the dynamo's drone pulsed through the\r\nroom. Hagendorff's fingers rested on a large lever that jutted from\r\nthe switchboard. Slowly, he pulled it to one side.\r\n\r\nThe imprisoned cat, small as a rat, had been nervously whipping its\r\ntail from side to side and meowing plaintively; but, as the lever\r\nswung over, there came a change. The vacuum tubes behind the\r\nswitchboard glowed green; a bright white ray poured from the spray in\r\nthe chamber, making the metal plate below a shimmering, almost molten\r\nthing. The animal's legs suddenly braced on it; its narrowed eyes\r\nwidened, glazing weirdly, while the tail became a stiff, bristling\r\nramrod. And, as a balloon swells from a strong breath, the cat's body\r\nincreased in size. It grew not in spurts, but with a smooth, flowing\r\nrhythm: grew as easily as a flower unfolding beneath the sun.\r\n\r\nIn only a few seconds its original size was attained. Howard raised\r\nhis hand; the lever shot back and the white beam faded into\r\nnothingness. A full sized and very angry cat tore around the inside of\r\nthe chamber.\r\n\r\n\"Normal?\" Hagendorff questioned. The other nodded and prepared to open\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! She always was a little undersized; I give her a few inches\r\nmore as a reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not too much,\" warned Garth. \"She's got a nasty temper; we don't\r\nwant a wildcat prowling round here!\"\r\n\r\nThe white beam flashed, the tubes glowed and almost instantly\r\nflickered off again. When the chamber's door was opened, an indignant\r\nand slightly oversized cat bounded through, leaped from the table with\r\na squawled oath of hatred and streaked into the front room of the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGarth turned and faced Hagendorff, a smile on his lips and a gleam in\r\nhis eyes. He ran his fingers through his black hair.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"now it's time for the final experiment. Who shall it\r\nbe?\"\r\n\r\nHagendorff did not answer at once, and the American went on:\r\n\r\n\"I think it'd better be me. There's a slight risk, of course, and I,\r\nas the inventor, could never ask an assistant to do anything I\r\nwouldn't. Is it all right with you?\"\r\n\r\nHagendorff nodded quickly in answer. Garth stood reflecting for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\"Guinea pigs, rabbits and insects have survived reduction to\r\none-twentieth normal size,\" he said slowly. \"It should be safe for the\r\nhuman body to descend just as far. But stop me at about two feet this\r\nfirst time. I'm not taking any chances; I want to be alive and kicking\r\nwhen I announce the success of my experiments to the scientific\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nHis assistant said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, here goes,\" Garth added. \"I'd better take off my clothes if I\r\ndon't want to be buried in them. They're not affected by the process.\r\nMust be because of the lack of organic connection between their fibers\r\nand the human body.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, nude, he jumped onto the laboratory table. He\r\npresented a perfect specimen of well-developed manhood as he stood\r\nbefore the door of the chamber. His smooth skin, under which the\r\nrounded muscles rolled easily, gleamed white beneath the glare of the\r\nfloodlight. His gray eyes glanced at the stolid assistant, who already\r\nhad one hand on the switchboard's lever. Garth saw that the hand was\r\ntrembling slightly, and smiled as he realized Hagendorff was as\r\nexcited as he. He said:\r\n\r\n\"I'll leave the door ajar, so you can more easily watch every phase of\r\nthe reduction. If it's painful--well, I guess I can stand anything a\r\ncat can!\"\r\n\r\nThen, stooping slightly, Garth stepped in and drew the door almost\r\nshut.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe relaxed as much as possible from the tremendous excitement that\r\nfilled him, and nodded at Hagendorff.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready,\" he said. \"Go ahead!\"\r\n\r\nThe ray came to his body as the crash of thunder comes to the ear. His\r\nnerves leaped as it struck and enveloped him. He felt as if he were\r\nentombed in ice, and yet his veins were aflame. Fiery shafts fanged\r\nhim all through and resolved, presently, into a measured, tingling\r\nbeat.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts raced. He knew that those minute particles of matter, the\r\natoms of his body, were being compacted; he sensed that his legs were\r\nrigid, his body stiff, his eyes clamped ahead in a glazed stare. He\r\nwas only half-conscious of the objects outside, but the dim sight of\r\nthem was fantastic and nauseous.\r\n\r\nThere was Hagendorff's face peering in at him--growing! Swelling as\r\nthe cat's body had swollen; and yet receding and rising until Garth,\r\nmomentarily forgetting that he was the one whose size was changing,\r\nthought that the man's titanic body would fill the room. But the room\r\nwas growing, too: the stools were becoming leviathans of wood, the\r\nwalls were like cliffs, the compact switchboard was a large surface\r\nof black, and the chamber in which he stood grew into a high-roofed\r\nvault, its sides shooting up and retreating as if shoved by invisible\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAnd still he sank, and still the terrible light devoured him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a delirious sensation engulfed him; his senses went reeling\r\naway, and he staggered. Then with a wrench he came to. As he regained\r\ncontrol of his mind he knew the lever had been switched off and the\r\nprocess completed.\r\n\r\nHe found that he was gasping. He passed a hand over his sweat-studded\r\nface and looked around.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside was the room of a giant. And in a moment a giant became\r\nvisible. His vast bulk filled the chamber's doorway; his mammoth face\r\npeered in. Garth's eardrums quivered from a deep bass rumble, sounding\r\nlike thunder on a distant horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right, Howard?\"\r\n\r\nA finger half the length of his own arm reached forward and prodded\r\nhim. For a second Garth could do nothing but stare at it. It brought\r\nhome to him starkly the puny size of his body, only two feet in\r\nheight. He felt suddenly afraid. But that was foolish, he thought; and\r\nhe laughed, his voice ludicrously high and shrill.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right,\" he cried. \"But I can hardly understand you. If I were\r\nmuch smaller, I probably couldn't--your voice'd seem so deep. Gangway,\r\nHagendorff, I'm coming out!\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were just below the level of the giant's shoulders. He\r\nstepped from the black chamber and stared amazedly at the room, at the\r\nchairs, the objects in it--at the laboratory table on which he was\r\nstanding, along which he might have sprinted thirty yards. A surge of\r\nexultant animal spirits flowed through him. His dream had become a\r\nreality; the machine had passed its last test! His body was sound and\r\nwhole; he felt perfectly natural; he had not changed, save in size;\r\nand in size he was like Gulliver, confronted with a Brobdingnagian\r\nroom!\r\n\r\nHe hurdled a five-inch-high box of tools, ran down the creaking table\r\nand stood laughing in front of a rack of test tubes half as high as he\r\nwas. Three strides took Hagendorff opposite him; and from above the\r\nthunderous voice rumbled:\r\n\r\n\"What were your sensations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably as close as man'll ever get to the feelings of a spark of\r\nelectricity!\" the midget replied. \"But bearable, though I was freezing\r\nand burning at the same time. My body was rigid, paralyzed--just like\r\nthe animals we used. I couldn't move.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure you couldn't move? You were helpless?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe booming voice throbbed with sudden interest. Garth looked up\r\ncuriously. \"No,\" he repeated. \"I couldn't move. But lift me down,\r\nHagendorff. I want to take a walk on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nA hand wrapped around his body, tensed and strained upwards. The\r\ntwo-foot-high man was not quite pulled off the table. Then Hagendorff\r\ngrunted and relaxed his grasp.\r\n\r\n\"I had forgotten,\" he rumbled. \"Your weight remains the same. You are\r\none-third my size, yet you weigh almost as much as I do. Weight, which\r\nis the sum of the mass of all the atoms in you, is not, naturally,\r\naffected by compacting those atoms.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only by a great effort that he was able to deposit the manikin\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\nFor a while Garth strolled around, savoring to their full the\r\nfantastic sensations his diminished stature gave him, at once amused\r\nand somehow frightened by the overwhelming size of the laboratory. To\r\nhis eyes, the tables were like bridges; Hagendorff's broad figure\r\nloomed monstrously over him, and the guinea pigs and rabbits in their\r\ncages seemed as big as fair-sized dogs. With a grin, he looked up at\r\nthe giant who was his assistant.\r\n\r\n\"Think I'll make the return trip, and give you a chance,\" he said.\r\n\"I've had my share, and the process has been proven. It's weird, being\r\ndown in this new world all alone. I'd hate to think what would happen\r\nif a rat came along!\"\r\n\r\nSilently, Hagendorff stooped and grasped him again. But Garth, when he\r\nstood once more inside the chamber, regarded his huge, rough-moulded\r\nface curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" he said, puzzled, \"your hands are trembling like the devil!\r\nWhat's wrong? You're more nervous than I am!\"\r\n\r\nHagendorff did not answer. He advanced to the switchboard. His\r\nnarrowed, deep-set eyes shot a quick glance at the small, nude man\r\ninside the chamber, and for a second one hand hovered over the lever\r\non the panel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn that tense second a flash of intuition, of deadly fear, came to\r\nGarth Howard, and he leaped wildly forward. But his rear foot did not\r\nleave the floor of the chamber, and his shout of alarm was choked\r\nmidway. Again the fierce ray paralyzed every muscle in him, and he was\r\nlocked motionless where he was.\r\n\r\nHelplessly, his glazed eyes stared at Hagendorff, while every moment\r\nhis rigid little body melted downwards. He was becoming rapidly\r\nsmaller, not larger!\r\n\r\nThrough the agony of the stabbing electrical waves, in vain Garth\r\ntried to wrench his legs free. The few inches that separated him from\r\nthe door were an impassable barrier. Sheer panic clutched him. He was\r\ntrapped. But why? Why had Hagendorff tricked him?\r\n\r\nAs if reading the question, the giant outside came close to the\r\nchamber's door and regarded his captive with eyes that were lit by a\r\npeculiar flame. He grunted, then reached backward and returned the\r\nswitchboard lever almost to the neutral point, reducing the speed of\r\nthe decreasing process.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is better,\" the German gloated, in a deep, satisfied tone.\r\n\"It will be slower, now. Slower--and more interesting to watch!... I\r\nfancy your eyes are reproachful, my friend. Why have I done it, you\r\nwonder? _Ach!_ This machine, it will startle the world of science; it\r\nwill make its inventor famous--not? Yes; and did you think I was going\r\nto stand by and see all the credit go to you? No! To me it shall\r\ngo--me alone! And you--\" He chuckled and rubbed his hands before going\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"You shall be what the newspapers call a martyr to science. You shall\r\nsink to a foot, to six inches--to one inch--even less, I think!\r\nEventually the reduction will kill you, of course; and your body shall\r\nbe proof of how you died--in an experiment--and shall also prove the\r\nmachine's power and my genius!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe laughed thunderously, a blond and malevolent titan. He did not\r\nnotice that, with the lessening of the reduction's speed, a slight\r\ntrace of control over his muscles had returned to the midget inside.\r\nHis tiny body was slowly diminishing, and complete, hopeless paralysis\r\nand death was not far away. But Garth was fighting every second,\r\nfighting desperately with the trace of strength he possessed to slide\r\nto the door, break the contact and get out from under the ray's\r\nremorseless influence. Almost imperceptibly, the effort lacerating\r\nhim with pain, he slid his feet forward. Hagendorff talked on. He\r\nseemed to be blinded by the vision of the fame his treachery would\r\nbring him.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have an experiment, my Professor; and then you will have an\r\ninteresting death! The ray will suck you down; you will crumple and\r\ncrumple till you're not much bigger than my thumbnail! And then I\r\nshall--_ah!_\"\r\n\r\nGarth had torn loose. Calling on every ounce of strength and will, the\r\nmidget, now no more than one foot high, had reached the edge of the\r\nfloor plate and pitched out onto the long laboratory table.\r\n\r\nGiant and dwarf faced each other. For a moment neither spoke or moved.\r\nA breathless tensity hung over the laboratory. The machine droned on,\r\nforgotten. From outside, startlingly near, came the eery hoot of an\r\nowl.\r\n\r\nA tight smile broke through the angry surprise on Hagendorff's face.\r\n\"Well, well!\" he said, with gargantuan, macabre humor. \"We object! It\r\nwas foolish, eh, to reduce the power? Next time, it shall not be so.\r\nWe--_object!_\"\r\n\r\nWith the word, he lunged, and his bulky arms lashed down in a wide,\r\ngrasping sweep.\r\n\r\nBut Garth's taut muscles, retaining all the strength and vigor of\r\ntheir normal size had been awaiting just such a move, and his tiny\r\nbody described the arc of a tremendous leap that neatly vaulted one\r\nhuge arm and started him sprinting swiftly down the table.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end he wheeled, and before the other overcame his surprise at\r\nsuch a nimble retreat, burst out indignantly:\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Hagendorff, what's come over you? Be sensible! You\r\ncan't do this; you can't really mean it! Why--\"\r\n\r\n\"So!\" roared the assistant, and his rush cut short the midget's\r\nshrill, frantic words. But his grasp this time was better judged;\r\nGarth felt the great fingers slip over his body. Remembering his\r\nstrength, he lashed out at one with all his might. Hagendorff grunted\r\nwith pain; but instead of continuing the attack, he suddenly turned\r\nand strode to the door leading into the other room, and closed it with\r\na bang.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot escape,\" he growled, advancing again; \"you merely delay.\"\r\n\r\nPanting, Garth glanced around the room. He was, in truth, trapped.\r\nThere was but the one door; and even if he could reach it, he could\r\nnot get it open, for the handle would be far above him. The room was a\r\nsealed arena. For a little while it would go on--a wild leaping and\r\ndodging on the table, a hopeless evading of mammoth hands ... and\r\nthen, inevitably, would come a crushing grip on his body, followed by\r\nexperimentation and the agony of death in the black chamber.\r\n\r\nFearful, he waited, a perfect, living statuette, twelve inches\r\nhigh....\r\n\r\nA grunt preluded the giant's vicious charge. The American staggered\r\nfrom the brush of a sweeping hand; then, twisting mightily, he dove\r\nunder it, like a mouse slipping under the paw of a cat. In doing so he\r\nfell sprawling; and though he was up in a moment, his arm was held. A\r\nhoarse, exultant rumble came to his ears.\r\n\r\n\"Caught, my friend!\"\r\n\r\nBut Hagendorff spoke too soon. With a great wrench, Garth broke free,\r\nand made a tigerish dash back along the table toward the window. And\r\neven as the clumsy titan jumped to the side and grabbed again at him,\r\nhe hurled his tiny, heavy body against the pane, and went plunging\r\nthrough a shower of glass into the cool dark night outside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe fell five feet, and the wind was jarred out of him as he crashed\r\nthrough the branches of a bush under the window into the sodden earth\r\nbeneath. Unhurt, save for a few lacerations from the glass, he\r\nstaggered to his feet, gasping for his breath, and started to run\r\nacross the clearing towards the fringe of dense forest growth that\r\nringed the cabin.\r\n\r\nThen he heard thunderous footsteps and, a second later, the sound of\r\nthe front door being pulled open. Garth turned in his tracks, and\r\nstumbled back beneath the cabin, thanking heaven that it was raised on\r\nshort stilts. But the ruse did not give him much of a start, and by\r\nthe time he had painfully threaded his way between the piles of timber\r\nleft underneath the cabin, Hagendorff had discovered the trick and was\r\nscouting back.\r\n\r\nThen, with the strength of the hunted, Garth was out from under the\r\nother side and sprinting for the doubtful sanctuary of the forest.\r\n\r\nHis tiny feet, carrying the weight of a normal-sized man, sank ankle\r\nhigh into the muddy ground, several times almost tripping him. Even as\r\nhe got to where a trail through the bush began, and passed from the\r\ncold starlight into spaces black with clustered shadows, he heard a\r\nbellow from behind, and, glancing back, saw a monstrous shape come\r\nleaping on his tracks.\r\n\r\nHe had only seconds in which to find refuge; he could not stick to the\r\ntrail. Thick bush, dank and heavy from recent rains, was on either\r\nside, fugitive streaks of pale light from above painting it eerily.\r\nGarth plunged into the matted growth, dropped to hands and knees and\r\nwormed forward away from the trail. Earth-jarring footbeats sounded\r\nclose. With frantic haste he wrenched though the scratching tendrils\r\nand came to a miniature clearing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe saw the tilted shape of a rotted tree-stump, its roots half washed\r\naway and exposing a narrow crevice between them. Gasping, the nude,\r\nfoot-high figure tumbled down into it, and lay there, trying to hush\r\nhis labored breathing.\r\n\r\nHe was a mere twenty feet from the trail; and though to him the bush\r\nwas a jungle, to his pursuer it was only chest-high. A towering shadow\r\nmoved along the trail. The thud of heavy footbeats came more slowly to\r\nthe listening midget. Hagendorff was searching, puzzled by the vague\r\nshadows, for where Garth had left the path.\r\n\r\nSilence fell.\r\n\r\nGarth's heart was pounding like a trip-hammer. He held himself alert,\r\nready, if need be, to struggle up from the moist crevice and dart on\r\nfurther into the bush. He could not see the giant, but could picture\r\nhis huge, sullen face all too clearly. Still no sound came. Risking\r\nall, he gripped a root and hauled himself up slightly. Then he peered\r\naround the stump.\r\n\r\nHagendorff was standing in the thick of the bush. He was not ten feet\r\naway, striving in the gloom to discern the other's tell-tale tracks.\r\nGarth drew his head back, hardly daring to breathe. Shivering, his\r\nnaked body miserably cold, he waited, pressed down in the soggy earth.\r\nHis betraying tracks were there; the shadows alone befriended him.\r\n\r\nThe silence was drawn so fine that the faint cheep of a night-bird\r\nsounded startlingly loud. But then came thunder that sent the bird\r\nwinging away in fright, and the night and the forest echoed with the\r\nroar of a wrathful, impatient human voice.\r\n\r\n\"You hear me, wherever you are! And hear this: I leave you now, but in\r\nten minutes I have you! You little fool--you think you can get free?\r\nIt is only by minutes you delay me!\"\r\n\r\nSnarling a curse, the treacherous giant turned and crashed through the\r\nbush and took his huge form striding back towards the cabin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGarth was thinking of many things as he scrambled back wearily from\r\nhis refuge to the trail. He was cursing the unwanted publicity which\r\nprying reporters had given his work in Detroit, and which had led him\r\nto lease the lonely island and build a laboratory in the wilderness.\r\nHad it not been for that publicity, he would never have needed an\r\nassistant, and the vision of fame would never have come to delude\r\nHagendorff and turn his thoughts towards murder.\r\n\r\nHis position seemed a horrible delirium from which he must presently\r\nawake. Naked, dwarfed by each ordinary forest weed, unarmed, and\r\ntrembling from the wind-sharpened night, he hardly knew which way to\r\nturn. His body was blotched with blood and mud, and under it the\r\nragged gashes made by glass and bush stung painfully; he was hungry\r\nand stiff and tired and miserable. He remembered Hagendorff's threat\r\nof capturing him in ten minutes, and forced a smile to his face.\r\n\r\n\"Looks kind of bad,\" he muttered, using his voice in an attempt to\r\ndispel some of the lonely grip of the night, \"but we'll keep moving,\r\nanyway! He's coming back soon. Let's see: I'd better make for the\r\nstream. It'll be hard for him to follow my tracks through that. And\r\nthen....\"\r\n\r\nThen--what? The island was small. He realized he could not stand many\r\nhours of exposure. Inevitably--But he turned his mind from the future\r\nand its seeming hopelessness, and concentrated on the immediate need,\r\nwhich was to hide himself. Forcing the pace, he struck off on a\r\nshambling trot down the dim trail, on into the deepening, sinister\r\nshadows towards the island's lone stream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nObstacles that normally he would not have noticed made his path\r\ntortuous. His great weight sank his feet ankle-high in the moist,\r\nuneven ground. Time and time again he stumbled over some imbedded rock\r\nthat, potato-sized, was like a boulder to him. Time and time again he\r\nfell, and when he rose his legs were plastered with soggy earth that\r\ndid not dry; and the damp, fallen leaves and twigs he pitched into\r\nclung to his coating of mud. Each broken limb and branch, dropped from\r\nthe whispering gloom of the trees above, drained the energy from his\r\ntiring muscles. Soon he was conscious of a vague numbness creeping\r\nover him, a deceptive, drowsy warmth into which he longed to sink, but\r\nwhich he drove back by working his arms and legs as vigorously as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nOn he went, with teeth clenched and eyes fixed on the half-seen trail\r\nahead--a fantastic, tiny creature hunted like a wild animal by a giant\r\nof his own kind!\r\n\r\nPresently, through the shroud of darkness traced by ghostly slivers of\r\nstarlight, came the sound of trickling water. The trail rose, dipped\r\ndown; and through that hollow crawled the stream, winding from a\r\nhidden spring to the encompassing river below. Garth was winded when\r\nhe came to it; to his eyes it seemed a small river. His legs were so\r\nnumb they hardly felt the cold bite of the water that lapped around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSome furry water animal leaped away as Garth trudged upstream, alarmed\r\nby the strange midnight visitant and the self-encouraging mutterings\r\nof a shrill human voice....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had waded what seemed to him a weary distance--in reality only a\r\nfew hundred yards--through the winding, icy creek, when suddenly he\r\nhalted and stood stock-still. Listening, he heard the ordinary sounds\r\nof the wind through the fir-spires, and the slow trickle of water;\r\nheard the beating of his own heart. Nothing else. And yet.... He took\r\nanother step.\r\n\r\nThen he swung quickly around and peered back, senses alert. There was\r\nno mistaking the sound that had come again. It was the crunch of heavy\r\nfeet, thudding at even intervals on damp earth. They were\r\nHagendorff's; and he was armed with light!\r\n\r\nA long beam of white speared through the tangle of bush and tree\r\ntrunks far below. It came slanting down from above, prying for the\r\nstory recorded by miniature footprints in the ground. By its distance\r\nfrom him, Garth could tell Hagendorff had come to where his trail led\r\ninto the stream. The ray held steady for minutes. Again it prowled\r\nnervously around, hunting for tell-tale signs, sweeping in widening\r\ncircles. Then, it was punctuated by the crunch of a boot.\r\n\r\nThe giant was following upstream!\r\n\r\nWith the flashlight, he might even be able to trace the prints in the\r\nbed of the creek. Stooping, Garth crept ahead, as silently as he\r\ncould, though the stir of water at his feet seemed terribly loud.\r\nThere were keen ears behind, craned for sounds like that. He knew he\r\nwould have to hide again--quickly--and at that moment he saw a place.\r\n\r\nA cleft in the bank to his right held a small hole, dimly limned by a\r\nwisp of starlight. On hands and feet the midget scrambled cat-like to\r\nit. It slanted down and inwards, only inches wide, so that the earth\r\nwas close to his body when he slid feet-first inside. But it was warm\r\nand dry, for it was shielded by a ledge from rain, and with the warmth\r\nthe hunted manikin's spirits rose somewhat. The ray of light, which he\r\ncould see sweeping back and forth downstream, was still following\r\nslowly, as if Hagendorff were having trouble making out the\r\nwater-covered trail. Garth breathed easier, cuddled down--and then,\r\nfor some unaccountable reason, he felt uneasy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had not noticed it at first, but now his nostrils were filled with\r\na queer, musky odor that electrified his nerves and tensed his\r\nmuscles. He felt the short hairs on his neck rise; felt his lips\r\ntighten and draw back over clenched teeth. Some long-buried instinct\r\nwas warning him of danger--and suddenly he sprang from the hole and\r\nswung around.\r\n\r\nFrom it, a killer came snaking out, its bared fangs thirsty for his\r\nlife blood!\r\n\r\nArching and swaying its lithe-muscled body, it slid forward in its\r\ngraceful, savage way--a weasel, the deadliest pound-for-pound killer\r\nthat prowls the forest. It was as long as the naked human who faced it\r\nwas tall. Unwittingly, he had chosen its hole as a refuge.\r\n\r\nRetreat would have been impossible, but Garth for some reason did not\r\neven think of it. A strange new sensation poured through his tense\r\nbody, a sensation akin to fierce joy. Gone was his tiredness; his\r\nteeth too were bared, matching the wicked fangs before him. Two primal\r\ncreatures they were, tooth to tooth and claw to claw, the man as naked\r\nand intoxicated with the blood lust as the ten pounds of bone and\r\nsinew that now darted suddenly for his throat.\r\n\r\nWith the lightning quickness that had come to him with small size,\r\nGarth stepped aside. And as the weasel's head streaked by he called\r\non man's distinctive weapon, and put every ounce of his weight behind\r\na right arm swing that landed square on a cold black nose and doubled\r\nthe weasel back in midair.\r\n\r\nStunned, it writhed for a second on the slippery bank; and then again\r\nit was up, mad with pain now and swaying slightly as it gathered for a\r\nsecond leap against this creature that fought so strangely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut in the momentary respite Garth had reasoned out his best chance.\r\nHe did not try to fight off the second dart with his fists, but went\r\nboldly in. Ducking through the needle claws with head lowered, his\r\ntiny hands streaked in on the furry throat. He found it, and his\r\nfingers thumbed into the wind-pipe; but not before the weasel smelled\r\nthe blood its claws had drawn and went utterly berserk. For a moment\r\nthere was a wild flurry of furry, tearing legs and a blood-streaked\r\nwhite body between them, trying desperately to evade their slicing\r\nstrokes. They pitched down the bank together, animal and man\r\nstruggling silently to the death; and when they jarred to a stop in\r\nthe water below, Garth's strategy was achieved.\r\n\r\nHe was uppermost; his grip was steel around the throbbing throat, and\r\nthe hundred and eighty pound weight of his body was holding the legs\r\npowerless. Not an inch from his face the weasel's fangs clashed\r\nfrantically together. Garth maintained his clutch, squeezing with\r\nevery bit of his mighty strength. The animal shuddered; then writhed\r\nin the death convulsions; at last lay still.\r\n\r\nPanting, his mind a welter of primate emotions roused by the kill, the\r\nman shook it a last time, jumped to his feet and glared around--to see\r\nthe beam of a flashlight only a dozen yards away. His more deadly foe,\r\nthe human foe, was upon him. Perhaps the sounds of the fight had\r\nreached his ears.\r\n\r\nGarth lost not a moment. Quickly he slung the weasel's body back into\r\nthe hole and jammed himself down after it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHagendorff approached slowly, mumbling and cursing to himself in\r\nsullen ill-humor. Things were not going as he had expected them to.\r\nThe white ray scoured the banks of the stream, searching doggedly.\r\nNearer he came, and with each step the watching midget's rapid\r\nbreathing grew tighter. The towering body was more than shadow now.\r\nAnother ten feet and the flashlight would find the marks of the fight.\r\n\r\nBut the titan's patience gave out. Closer than he had yet been to his\r\nquarry, he paused, and again the thunder of his voice broke the\r\nnight's hush.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! This is foolish! In daylight I find him certainly. I have waited\r\nlong; I can wait a little more. I need sleep. To-morrow, it will be\r\ndifferent!\"\r\n\r\nHe swung away from the stream, and in a few minutes the rip and crash\r\nof his progress through the bush had died. In the silence, Garth\r\nHoward considered his situation.\r\n\r\nHe faced it squarely, as was his custom. He did not brood over the\r\ntreachery of his assistant, or of how unfairly and suddenly it had\r\nplunged him into peril and robbed him of his normal body. He accepted\r\nhis position and searched for possible angles of escape. There were\r\nnot many hours left in which to make a decisive move. The island was\r\nsmall, and, as Hagendorff had said, discovery would be inevitable in\r\ndaytime.\r\n\r\nGarth thought of the machine, and of the giant sleeping. A desperate\r\nplan came to him, and his jaws set decisively. \"I'll do it!\" he\r\nexclaimed aloud.\r\n\r\nThe lever which controlled both increase and decrease could be worked\r\nfrom inside the chamber if he rigged up a system of turning it with a\r\nwire or rope. If he pulled it to the increase only part way, he would,\r\nhe knew, have sufficient power over his muscles to pull it back off,\r\nor slide again from the chamber, as he had done before. Whether or not\r\nhe could do this depended on Hagendorff's being asleep. Possibly he\r\ncould be locked in the living room, if he were there. Or tied. The\r\nincrease, even at half speed, would only take about forty seconds.\r\nOnce back to his size there would be a fight without odds, Garth\r\nthought grimly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a big risk, and there was probably only a small chance of\r\nsucceeding, but it meant getting back to six feet, back to a normal\r\nworld, back to equal terms. That was the magnet which drew him\r\npresently toward the cabin laboratory.\r\n\r\nHe went slowly, to allow Hagendorff plenty of time to fall soundly\r\nasleep. The giant, as he had said, needed sleep--needed it badly--for,\r\nlike Garth Howard, he had done without it for forty-eight hours under\r\nthe excitement of imminent success in their work. Garth considered\r\nthat his move would be totally unexpected, being made right into the\r\nother's territory. There was a chance.\r\n\r\nAnd so, cold and weariness banished by thoughts of the goal ahead, he\r\nprowled back along the trail like any small creature of the forest.\r\n\r\nIt was half an hour later when he came in sight of the cabin. His\r\nheart drummed excitedly as he stood in the shadows surveying it. He\r\nwondered if Hagendorff was still awake; if he was, perhaps, waiting\r\nfor him. Certainly he did not seem to be: the cabin was dark and\r\nsilent, and the only door was tightly closed. Still--it might be\r\nwiser to retreat while still free....\r\n\r\n\"No, by heaven!\" Garth Howard exclaimed in his thoughts. \"I'm going\r\nthrough with it!\" Stooping slightly, he left the shadows and ran\r\nboldly into the starlight.\r\n\r\nHe half expected to hear a scuffle of feet and see the giant come\r\nleaping out at him; but nothing broke the silence. He made his careful\r\nway along the side of the cabin to the place where a trough for waste\r\nliquids led through a small hole at the level of the floor, and with\r\ngreat care wormed through.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he started to cautiously reconnoiter, he was suddenly arrested in\r\nhis tracks. He had caught the sound of deep, rhythmic breathing.\r\nHagendorff was asleep, not in the adjoining living room--but in the\r\nlaboratory!\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Garth did not know what to do. Caution urged him to\r\nretreat; but that would not get him back to his size. On tip-toe, he\r\nexplored around. The boards squeaked beneath his great weight, but the\r\nnearby breathing beyond continued in regular rhythm.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were toned to the darkness of the laboratory; he saw the\r\nchamber of his atom-compacting machine, its outer sides ghostly in the\r\nfaint, reflected starlight, and stared at it with a pang of fierce\r\nlonging. So near, it was--so very near! Holding the stolen size of his\r\nbody; holding all that was vital to him; holding life itself--it\r\nrested there silently, within reach of a few steps and a quick climb\r\nup one of the table legs. So he thought, his brain whirling with\r\nmingled emotions, his tiny body shivering and aching with cold and its\r\nmany hurts. The machine was near--but a barrier blocked the way.\r\n\r\nHagendorff's bulk lay outstretched on a side table, black in the\r\nshadows, and from him came the level breathing of a sound sleeper,\r\nclimaxed now and again by a rumbling snore. He was taking no chances;\r\nhis presence there seemed to destroy any hope of the midget's\r\nregaining normal size. But Garth was desperate, and for a minute or so\r\nhe considered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nForty seconds, the increase would take, at half speed. It might be\r\nthat long before the giant would waken thoroughly and see what was\r\nhappening. He, Garth, might start the process, and, when he saw the\r\nhuge figure stirring and waking from the noise of the dynamo, switch\r\noff the ray and get out. No matter how short a time it took Hagendorff\r\nto throw off the fogginess of his sleep, he would be somewhat\r\nincreased in size, and the odds of combat would not be so great.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible risk. Did he dare take it? He thought of the forest,\r\nof the raw night, of what was threatened in the morning.... Yes!\r\n\r\nSilently, the manikin clasped the nearest table leg, shinnied up and\r\nhauled himself over the top. As he got there his heart leaped. A sharp\r\nthumping had come from behind. He dropped to his knees and glanced\r\nround; but he immediately rose again, reassured. It was only the\r\nrabbits in their cage, disturbed by the strange figure on the table.\r\nHe thanked God that they--and his tarantulas and other insects--could\r\nmake no alarming noises.\r\n\r\nGarth found a long strand of wire. The panel's control lever, swung to\r\nthe left, controlled increase; to the right, decrease. Garth's plan\r\nwas to wind the middle of the wire around it, relay each end around\r\nthe two supporting posts of the switchboard, and thus have both ends\r\nof the wire in his hands when he stood inside the chamber. One end of\r\nthe wire would enable him to pull the lever over for increase, and\r\nthe other to pull it back to neutral when the increase was completed,\r\nor when Hagendorff arose.\r\n\r\nQuickly he started to arrange the wire. Then suddenly his hands\r\ndropped and he stared dismayed at the control panel.\r\n\r\nThe power switch had been removed!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Hagendorff's work, of course. He had guarded every angle.\r\nWithout that switch, the mechanism was lifeless and literally\r\npowerless. It worked on a delicately adjusted and enclosed rheostat;\r\nthere was nothing that could be substituted for it. It would take\r\nhours to improvise one in the heart of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe switch, Garth reflected bitterly, was probably concealed somewhere\r\nabout the giant's body.\r\n\r\nHe considered the possibility of tying him. He knew where there was a\r\ncoil of light, pliable wire on the floor; he might be able to loop it\r\nover the giant's hands and legs while he slept, tie him securely, and\r\nthen go through his pockets for the switch. Another hazard! But there\r\nwas nothing else to do.\r\n\r\nGarth lowered himself over the table's edge and slid quietly down the\r\nleg. He glanced at the sleeping man, then over across the room to\r\nwhere, beneath another table, the wire was--and his nerves jumped at\r\nwhat he saw there.\r\n\r\nFrom the darkness under the table two spots of greenish fire, close to\r\nthe floor, held steadily on him.\r\n\r\nAs he stared, they vanished, to reappear more to the right. With the\r\nmovement, he glimpsed the outline of a lithe, crouching animal, and\r\nknew it to be the cat he and Hagendorff had experimented on earlier\r\nthat night. It was stalking him in the deliberate manner of its kind!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt came edging around, so as to leap on him from the side. He knew\r\nthat he represented fair prey to it; that if he tried to run, it would\r\npounce on him from behind. Wearily he tensed his miniature body,\r\nstanding poised on the balls of his feet and never dropping his eyes\r\nfor a moment. He could not repress a grim smile at the ludicrousness\r\nof being attacked by an ordinary house-cat, even though it was\r\ntiger-sized to him. Though his victory over the weasel, a far deadlier\r\nfighter, made him confident he could dispatch it, there was another\r\naspect to the approaching struggle. It would have to be fought in\r\nsilence. Not four feet away, Hagendorff slept. There lay the\r\noverwhelming danger.\r\n\r\nEven as these things flashed through his brain, the cat steadily\r\ninched nearer on its padded paws. Ghostly starlight framed it now;\r\nGarth could see the eager, quivering muscles, the long tail, flat\r\nbehind, twitching slightly, the rigid, unstirring head and the slowly\r\ncontracting paws. The terrible suspense of its stalking scraped his\r\nnerves. There would be a long pause, then an almost imperceptible\r\nhunching forward, with the tail ever twitching; then the same thing\r\nagain, and over again. It became unbearable. Garth deliberately\r\ninvited the attack.\r\n\r\nHe pretended to turn and run, his back towards it. At once he sensed\r\nits tensing body, its bunching muscles--then knew that it had sprung.\r\n\r\nWhirling, he had a fleeting impression of a supple body in midair, of\r\nbristling claws and bared, needlepoint fangs. But he was ready. The\r\nweasel had taught him his best weapon, the great weight of his body.\r\nHe streaked in beneath the wide-spread paws, shot his hands into the\r\nfur of the throat and threw himself against the shock of the animal's\r\nsuddenly arrested leap.\r\n\r\nThere was no standing his weight. Over the cat went, its back thudding\r\ninto the floor, its claws held powerless by the hundred and eighty\r\npounds of hard flesh that straddled it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fall had made little noise; but, as Garth tightened the grip of\r\nhis fingers and bored inward, a dull, steady thumping began to sound.\r\nIt was the cat's tail, pounding on the floor!\r\n\r\nDesperately he tried to hook a leg over it, but could not reach far\r\nenough. It beat like a tom-tom. From above, there came the sound of a\r\nhuge frame stirring, and the rumble of a sleepy grunt.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, the titan would be thoroughly awake.\r\n\r\nBy the drumming tail alone, Garth realized, his chance of regaining\r\nfull size was sent glimmering. There was nothing but retreat, now, and\r\na hasty one, if he valued life. Another noise came from the waking\r\nHagendorff. He was sitting up, staring around. Garth jumped to his\r\nfeet, threw the cat's twitching body beneath the table, and dodged at\r\nfull speed for the hole whereby he had entered.\r\n\r\nLike a mouse he wriggled through, leaped to the ground, scrambled up\r\nand made for the forest. He ran with all the speed at his command, and\r\nwas almost surprised when he reached the black fringe of the forest in\r\nsafety. In the protecting gloom, he dared to pause and look back.\r\n\r\nHagendorff was not pursuing him. From the sound, he was merely\r\nboarding shut the drain hole, to prevent another entrance in that way;\r\nthen, afterwards, the windows.\r\n\r\nGarth was puzzled. \"I don't understand it,\" he said aloud. \"Why is he\r\nso sure he can get me in the morning? Isn't he afraid I'll leave the\r\nisland? Why I've _got_ to try to get away, now. It would be death to\r\nbe here after the dawn!\"\r\n\r\nHe stood there making his plans. They had a rowboat below, powered\r\nwith an outboard motor. Even in his present size, he might possibly\r\nrun it, if he could get it started. He would strike down-river for\r\nDetroit, and when the gas gave out, the current would carry him on.\r\nSome river boat might pick him up and carry him to friends in the\r\ncity. His grotesquely dwarfed body would prove his story, and they\r\nwould bring him back and end Hagendorff's mad dream of fame, and help\r\nhim to regain his normal size. He could superintend the construction\r\nof another machine if the present one was wrecked.\r\n\r\nWhen he started down the trail to the river, he seemed to be walking\r\nthrough a haze. He felt curiously light-headed, and his body was\r\ncompletely numb. The long exposure was telling on him, and there was\r\nmuch more of it to come. He wondered if he could hold out until he\r\nreached the mainland.\r\n\r\nBut his mind cleared of the daze the cold and near-exhaustion had\r\nbrought it to when at last he came to the beach and realized that\r\nagain Hagendorff had anticipated him. The rowboat was gone! No wonder\r\nthe giant could afford to wait until daylight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGarth floundered down to the beach and ran to where the craft usually\r\nlay. There was only a groove in the rough, pebbly surface, a groove\r\nleft by the boat's keel. He followed it up the bank, and twenty yards\r\nin found the dinghy chained and locked firmly to a large tree.\r\n\r\nThe midget's face grew suddenly very haggard as he stood there,\r\nstaring at what looked like his death sentence. He should have known\r\nHagendorff would secure the boat, he told himself bitterly. It was a\r\ncruel blow, and sheer misery of mind and body gripped him as he turned\r\nand peered through the darkness of wind-whipped water and sky toward a\r\nhorizon that was already lightening. Down-river lay Detroit, a\r\nfriendly, everyday world. It was not far in miles, but it seemed lost\r\nto him forever....\r\n\r\nGarth took his eyes from that prospect with a wry twist to his mouth.\r\nIt chanced that they fell on the painter of the rowboat.\r\n\r\nIt was a stout Manila cord, some twenty feet in length, and tied\r\ntightly to a ring in the bow of the boat. He looked at it dully for a\r\nfull minute before the idea came to him. Then suddenly the lethargy\r\nbred of hopelessness left him. Garth remembered a pocket knife he had\r\nleft in the boat the day before. He climbed over the side and began to\r\nfumble about in the darkness. First he came upon a torn handkerchief\r\nwhich he hastily tied about his loins. Further probing disclosed the\r\nknife wedged under a seat in the boat. When he had finally extricated\r\nit, he threw the knife over the side and climbed out.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes of frantic cutting and hacking he severed the rope,\r\nand, quickly taking up one of the ends, ran with it further along the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nThere was still a way of getting off the island. A cold and risky way,\r\nbut better than waiting miserably for capture. On the bank was a pile\r\nof sawn logs, intended for firewood; and a strong rope was in his\r\nhands. Much indeed could be done now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe making of his raft proved a herculean task, a racking and almost\r\nimpossible one for a man limited by doll-sized hands and a foot-high\r\nbody. First the logs had to be rolled to the water's edge, six of\r\nthem. Each was as thick as he was tall, and this first part of his\r\ntask took him a precious half hour, every minute of which brought\r\nnearer the dawn. Ripples like ordinary waves washed up the struggling\r\nmanikin and left him gasping as he stood braced in the cold water and\r\ntugged one log after another out and wound the rope under and over it.\r\nThe raft had to be built in water; he would never have been able to\r\ndrag the whole thing off the beach.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he wearily tied the rope end to the last log, and stuck\r\nhis knife handy in it, the clouds on the horizon were flushed by the\r\ncoming sun. But his means of escape was completed; and hanging on the\r\nend, he shoved the raft out into the river. Right then he almost lost\r\nhis life. For when his feet left the sloping bottom, his great weight,\r\nout of all proportion to the size of his body, pulled him under, and\r\nit was only by virtue of a desperate clutch on the raft that he\r\nescaped drowning. Thrashing furiously, he struggled up from the water,\r\nand lay, totally blown, on the logs. It was then he first realized\r\nthat his chance of life was no stronger than the rope which held them\r\ntogether. For swimming was out of the question, and one or two logs\r\nwould never support his hundred and eighty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe end which he lay on was well under water, and the waves splashed\r\nup between the bobbing logs. The current he was headed for swept down\r\nfifty yards offshore, which was a sixth of a mile to the little legs\r\nnow thrust out behind and making a rhythmic flutter.\r\n\r\nHe was off the island! Freedom and life were near! Though his teeth\r\nwere chattering, his fingers crushed by the jarring logs, and his body\r\nutterly wretched, he grinned with joy as the stretch between him and\r\nthe gloomy mass of the island slowly widened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen came the sun. The skies faded from gray into a delicate,\r\ncloud-flecked blue; slowly the air warmed, and the surface of the\r\nwater seemed to calm under it. Though the sun was good on his body,\r\nGarth realized night was more friendly to him, for in the growing\r\nlight his craft was all too conspicuous to the giant who would\r\npresently be following his tracks down to the beach. He chided himself\r\nfor not having thought of camouflaging the raft with leafy branches.\r\nDoggedly, he forced it out.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he felt the pull of the current, he ceased his weary\r\nkicking and glanced up into the swiftly advancing dawn. There was a\r\nbird soaring through the keen air up there, gliding in easy circles\r\nwith almost motionless wings. Garth gazed at it somewhat wistfully,\r\nenvying its freedom and power of flight. And then he shut his eyes. He\r\nwas very tired....\r\n\r\nHe must have dozed off for a moment, for he awoke to find himself\r\nslipping off. With a sudden jerk he regained his position--and that\r\nwas what saved his life at that moment. For without warning, while he\r\nwas nodding, plumed death struck from the skies.\r\n\r\nIt dropped like a plummet, as was its manner. It had been circling\r\nabove and judging its swoop, and by rights its curved talons should\r\nhave arched deep into the unguarded back of the naked figure on the\r\nraft. But at the last second the figure moved aside--too late for the\r\nhawk to alter its swoop.\r\n\r\nThe raft rocked under the impact; for a moment Garth Howard, dazed by\r\nthe sudden attack, did not know what had happened. Huge scratching\r\nwings were thrashing about him; his left arm stung from where a claw\r\nhad raked it; and he wrenched around to stare into two wicked slits of\r\neyes behind a fierce, rounded beak that jabbed at him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvidently he represented easy prey to the hawk, for it did not soar\r\naway, but instead came at him again in a flurry of beating wings and\r\nstabbing beak, a vicious, feathered fighter from above. Caught off\r\nguard by the suddenness and savagery of the onslaught, Garth retreated\r\nstumblingly, forgetting his weight and the size of the raft and\r\ndefending himself with his arms as best he could against the rushes of\r\nthe hawk. The raft tilted perilously; water washed around his legs and\r\nhe slipped and went under.\r\n\r\nHe felt his fingers slipping inexorably over the edge of the log he\r\nhad gripped; his legs threshed up a welter of foam, but he kept going\r\ndown. Panic clutched him; his weight would sink him like a stone. But\r\nsuddenly his clutching hand was gripped by steel-like talons, and\r\nthrough the water he caught a glimpse of the hawk straining backwards\r\nwith mighty sweeps of its wings in an effort to lift him bodily into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nHis size had deceived it. It could not hoist him, but did manage to\r\ndrag his head and chest out of the water. That was enough. With an\r\neffort, Garth scrambled onto the raft.\r\n\r\nThe hawk, probably greatly surprised by its failure to soar away with\r\nsuch tiny prey, tore into him again, raking his body painfully. Hardly\r\nknowing what he did, Garth grabbed out as it hovered over him and\r\nsucceeded in wrapping his fingers around one of its legs. Then,\r\nbracing himself as best he could, and ignoring the scratching wings\r\nand piercing beak, he gave the leg a sharp twist and heard the crack\r\nof breaking bone.\r\n\r\nHe was only half-conscious of the hawk's shrill scream of pain, of\r\nits swift retreat into the blue, with the broken leg dangling\r\ngrotesquely. For only a moment he was aware that he had driven it off;\r\nthen the pain of his wounds and his utter exhaustion swept up over\r\nhim, and he flopped down on the raft in a dead faint....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a long time Garth was dimly aware of familiar noises. At first\r\nthey were faint and scarcely perceptible; but, as his senses slowly\r\nbegan to return, disturbing thoughts came to him. He felt that he was\r\non his back, and confined, and when he twisted, to turn over, he found\r\nhe could not. He opened his eyes and blinked.\r\n\r\nHe was back in the laboratory--lying bound, hand and foot, on the long\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe giant Hagendorff appeared over him, and his deep voice rumbled:\r\n\r\n\"Badly scarred and bruised, my little friend! Cats you have fought,\r\nand birds, and each has left its mark. It was useless to run away last\r\nnight--not?\"\r\n\r\nGarth was suddenly too full of a weary resignation to even think of\r\nspeaking. Remonstrance, he knew, would avail him nothing. The long\r\nstruggle for freedom and life was over, and he had lost.\r\n\r\nThe assistant was apparently in good humor. He went on:\r\n\r\n\"Really, it is too bad, after that magnificent fight of yours! A\r\nhawk--was it not? I was following your tracks, and had just reached\r\nthe beach when I see a great fuss on the water. A raft, I see! A bird,\r\nattacking something on it! A little white figure, struggling! Well, it\r\nis that easy. I unlock the boat and go to the raft and find my elusive\r\nfriend there, unconscious. So I bring him back here. He has forgotten:\r\nwe have an experiment to complete.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a fire of exultation in the man's eyes as they glared down\r\nat the midget who lay on the laboratory table, just a few feet away\r\nfrom the chamber of the machine. He reached out and ran a thick finger\r\nover his victim's body.\r\n\r\n\"You do not deserve this,\" he said. \"I should kill you outright--but,\r\ngraciously, I give you death in the machine. Yours will be the first\r\nhuman body to be reduced to an inch; maybe less. This is your\r\nmartyrdom; for this, your name will live, along with mine, for having\r\nperfected the process.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGarth Howard saw that the window was boarded tightly shut. Then\r\nHagendorff caught his eyes as, with a grin, he plunged a hand into a\r\npocket and drew forth the missing panel switch. He dangled it in front\r\nof Garth.\r\n\r\n\"What you would have given for this last night, eh? With your wire to\r\npull the lever so carefully arranged! _Ach_, it was too bad!\" He\r\nshrugged, then picked up a screwdriver and turned to fix the switch on\r\nthe control panel.\r\n\r\nThe moment his back was turned, Garth gazed frantically around. The\r\nfantastic fate he had striven so desperately to stave off was very\r\nclose now. What could he do?\r\n\r\nSome tools lay on the table, just out of his reach, among them a pair\r\nof cutting pliers. He stared at the pliers--an overgrown tool, half as\r\nlong as his own body. The twist of Hagendorff's wrist driving home the\r\nfirst screw brought a cold chill over him. The pliers! It was a\r\nchance!\r\n\r\nHe twisted a little, and keeping his eyes on the giant's back, he\r\ninched toward them. His hands, tied at the wrists behind him, clutched\r\nfor them; found them. The jaws were open, and there were two sharp\r\ncutting edges. He could not hope to manipulate the whole implement\r\nwith his bound hands, but he located one edge, painfully brought the\r\nrope to it and sawed rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe steel sliced his flesh, and he felt the warm stickiness of blood.\r\nBut he disregarded this and kept on. Hagendorff was still working, all\r\nunconscious--but the last screw was going in. And then some strands of\r\nthe rope snapped, and it loosened.\r\n\r\nThe next second, Garth had wrenched his hands free.\r\n\r\nThen, throwing caution to the winds, he sat up, grabbed the great tool\r\nand sliced the rope at his feet.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Hagendorff finished his job and turned around.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met. For a breathless instant nothing happened, save that\r\nthe smile on the titan's face changed to surprise and then fury. Garth\r\nscrambled to his feet. The movement brought a bellow of rage, and the\r\nmanikin saw two enormous hands converging on him in a sweep that bade\r\nfair to crush every bone in his dwarfed body.\r\n\r\nLeaping backwards instinctively, he hurled the pliers at the giant's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThey were well aimed, and he saw them strike the temple, stopping the\r\nman in his tracks. He thundered, more from anger than pain. His heart\r\npounding wildly, Garth ran back to a position behind a rack of test\r\ntubes. It was from there that he saw Hagendorff, cursing crazily, grab\r\nup a machinist's hammer and advance upon him.\r\n\r\nAll sanity had apparently left the giant. His great face was flushed\r\nand distorted, and a growing welt showed where the pliers had clipped\r\nhim. Garth suddenly knew that if he were captured again, death would\r\nnot come in the chamber, but from those powerful hands, or the weapon\r\nthey clutched.\r\n\r\nThe hammer swung back for a crushing blow. But in the instant it hung\r\npoised, Garth lifted a half-filled test tube from the rack before him\r\nand swished its contents forward.\r\n\r\nThe tube held sulphuric acid, and it sprayed over Hagendorff's face.\r\nThe hammer pitched from his hand; he clutched at his eyes and stumbled\r\nback, shrieking in agony.\r\n\r\nGarth at once ran to the edge of the table, swung himself over and\r\nslid down the leg to the floor. The laboratory door was open and he\r\ndashed for it. But, whether or not Hagendorff could see his frantic\r\nretreat, he anticipated it, and with a reeling plunge he got there\r\nfirst. Fumbling, he found the key in the hole and turned it. The room\r\nwas sealed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeginning then, the blind Hagendorff was a man berserk. With a sobbing\r\nroar of pain and fury, he lashed round for the foot-high figure that\r\ndodged and wheeled and zig-zagged to keep from his threshing arms and\r\nhis hands. A table crashed over, and a flood of chemicals mixed and\r\nboiled on the floor; then another, as the giant blundered blindly into\r\nit. The cages of animals split open, and guinea pigs, rabbits and\r\ninsects scuttled from their prisons, fleeing to the corners from the\r\nwild plunges of the raging German.\r\n\r\nGarth went reeling from a glancing blow, and fell against an\r\nover-turned stool under a far table where he could hardly breathe for\r\nthe mixed odors of spilt chemicals. By some sixth sense, Hagendorff\r\nseemed to locate him, for his huge body turned and came directly for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut Garth did not wait. Seizing the stool he whirled it so that it\r\nslid smash into the giant's legs. The man pitched over with a grunt,\r\nstriking the floor so hard that the planks shivered.\r\n\r\nHe did not rise. He lay there, in a wreckage of glass and splintered\r\nwood and stinking chemicals, moaning slightly.\r\n\r\nGarth wasted no time, but gripped a leg of the laboratory table,\r\nshinned to the top and with frantic speed fixed his strand of wire\r\nonto the control lever and round the supporting posts of the\r\ninstrument panel. Then he jumped for the dynamo switch, caught the\r\nhandle and jerked it down.\r\n\r\nThe drone of a generator surged through the room. Then the midget was\r\nstanding in the chamber, both ends of the wire in his hands; and his\r\nheart was thudding madly as he pulled one of them.\r\n\r\nIt held. Over came the lever, halfway. The brilliant stream of the ray\r\npoured down. Dimly the manikin glimpsed the chamber's walls sinking\r\ndown, the wreckage-strewn room outside diminishing to normal size.\r\nFiery pain throbbed through him, but it was lost in the exultation\r\nthat filled his mind as the seconds went by. He grew to two feet, two\r\nand a half--three.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut beyond that he was not to go. The swaying shape of Hagendorff\r\nloomed outside the cube. Aroused by the drone of the generator and\r\nwhat it signified, the giant had floundered up from the floor and now\r\ncame clutching blindly for him.\r\n\r\nGarth knew he would have to leave the chamber at once; so, struggling\r\nfor command of his muscles through the paralysis that numbed them, he\r\ntensed his hold on the other wire and pulled it a little. The control\r\nlever swung back to neutral; the ray faded and Garth jumped out. He\r\nwas only a few feet away from the huge convulsed face as the German\r\nroared:\r\n\r\n\"By God, you'll never get back on _this_ machine!\"\r\n\r\nHis purpose was plain; his groping hand had already found the control\r\nlever. To prevent his ripping it out, Garth plunged head first into\r\nHagendorff's stomach, and they both went down in a flurry of arms and\r\nlegs. Garth, scrambling to get loose, was conscious of the ray pouring\r\ndown again in the chamber above. The lever had not been wrenched out,\r\nbut jerked over, setting the process of increase on.\r\n\r\nThe next few minutes were a chaos. Now that Howard was three feet tall\r\nhe was without some of the advantages of his former smallness and\r\ncompactness, and his utmost efforts failed to free him from the death\r\nclutch of the pain-maddened giant. Over and over they rolled on the\r\nfloor. Garth trying only to break free, and the other relentlessly\r\nholding on and dragging him over to the chamber again.\r\n\r\nIt was a losing fight for the diminutive one, weakened as he was by\r\nhis exposure and the fierce fights he had had. Little by little,\r\nsquirming and resisting with all his remaining strength, he was\r\nbrought near--to see the German, at last, pull half the reducing\r\napparatus with a crash to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe ray in the chamber faded off. The machine was silenced forever, so\r\nthat Garth could never hope to regain his full size in this one....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the realization of this, most of his spirit went, while the\r\nsavage giant, successful in smashing the machinery, now turned and\r\ndevoted himself exclusively to his victim.\r\n\r\n\"Now for you!\" he roared in frightening triumph, clutching the smaller\r\nman's neck with his great hands and bearing him to the floor.\r\n\r\nAgainst those fingers gouged into his wind-pipe like a vise of steel,\r\nGarth could do nothing. Feebly he gagged, and feebly he clawed at the\r\npitiless hands--and futilely.\r\n\r\nIt was the end, he told himself. He had come close, but closeness did\r\nnot count. His eyes bulged, and a shroud of black began to obscure his\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, over the giant's flexed arms, he glimpsed, coming\r\nfrom the chamber on the table, something that chilled the blood in his\r\nveins with horror.\r\n\r\nIt was huge and utterly loathsome. Long, hairy legs folded out, and\r\nfollowing them came a furry, bloated body at least five feet thick.\r\nMany-faceted eyes fixed themselves coldly on the men on the floor. In\r\none hideous leap the monster soared from the table all the way to the\r\nroom's ceiling, seeming almost to float as it came down. For a moment\r\nit teetered on the floor, not five feet from the giant who, blind and\r\nall unconscious of it, was throttling his diminutive victim beneath\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nGarth for a second forgot the grip on his throat in the horror of the\r\nmonster. He knew at once what it was--a tarantula. It had crawled\r\ninside the chamber when its cage was broken, had been there even while\r\nhe had been there, and had been swollen to its present blood-curdling\r\nsize while they were fighting and the ray was on. With the smashing of\r\nthe apparatus, it was free to come out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt gathered for the final spring, its terrible legs tensing\r\nperceptibly--a creature out of a nightmare. Garth Howard tried to\r\nshriek out a warning, but Hagendorff was holding his throat too well.\r\nHe could only struggle weakly and nod toward the horror beyond; but\r\nthe message did not get across to the giant.\r\n\r\nThen the tarantula sprang again.\r\n\r\nFor a moment it seemed to hover on Hagendorff's upturned back. When it\r\nfloated down, its ragged legs cradled over him, and the egg-shaped\r\nbody squatted on his back....\r\n\r\nGarth felt his frayed nerves and senses going. A hairy leg was\r\ntouching him, chilling his flesh. Above him, the giant was thrashing\r\nimpotently, and he found his neck free of the awful grip.\r\n\r\nHe wormed free. He was hardly conscious of reaching up and unlocking\r\nthe door, and closing it tightly again as he stumbled forth. Later, it\r\nseemed that it was in a dream that he ran wildly into the splendid\r\nsunlight outside and down the winding trail. It was only by a\r\ntremendous effort that he kept his senses long enough to shove the\r\nrowboat out from the beach and hop in.\r\n\r\nHe never started the motor. All that he had seen and suffered on the\r\nisland of horror overcame him too soon, and he pitched down in a limp,\r\nunconscious heap....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so it was, that, the next morning, the two harbor policemen found\r\na rowboat with mysterious cargo floating silently down the Detroit\r\nRiver. So it was that some time later a launch with three local\r\nofficers churned up to the solitary island, and that gunshots echoed\r\nin the gloom of a hushed laboratory room, and a man's white-faced body\r\nwas carried from the cabin where he had made his one great treacherous\r\neffort to steal another's fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"JAZZING UP THE UNIVERSE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCenturies of celestial history wheeled across the plaster sky of the\r\nnew Adler planetarium at Chicago, recently, at the dedication of the\r\nastronomical institution, the first of its kind in the Western\r\nHemisphere.\r\n\r\nA modern Joshua, working the levers and switches of a complicated\r\ninstrument, commanded a miniature sun to stand still in the\r\nheavens--and it did. He bettered the feat of the Biblical prophet by\r\nstopping the sun at any given point on its orbit across the skies, and\r\nthen ran it backward, its attendant planets, planetoids and stars\r\nscampering contrary to all rules of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe Joshua in the person of Professor Philip Fox, director of the\r\nplanetarium on a \"made\" island in Lake Michigan described the\r\ninstrument with which he made the heavenly bodies cut capers, as a\r\nprojector, made in Germany at a cost of almost $100,000. As nearly as\r\nit can be described by a layman it looks like three immense diving\r\nhelmets capping the ends of a tube about six feet long. Each \"helmet\"\r\nis studded with lenses and inside are complicated and strange lights\r\nand projectors which throw the images of the celestial bodies on the\r\nwhite plaster dome above that represents the skies. The wheeling\r\nmotion of the universe toward the west is obtained by revolving the\r\n\"helmets\" in eccentric circles on an axis. The whole effect makes a\r\nspectator feel as if the solar system was revolving around him at a\r\ngreatly accentuated speed.\r\n\r\nAs a beginning lesson for the layman who attended the opening,\r\nProfessor Fox set the machine to represent the latitude of Chicago on\r\nMay 10, 1930. Every one turned his eyes to the east, where a\r\nsilhouette of Lake Michigan, with its lighthouses and ore ships, is\r\npainted on the plaster horizon. The dome was lighted to represent a\r\nclear night, and, incidentally, all nights are clear in a planetarium.\r\nThe machine was started and up from the center of the Lake jumped\r\nMars, red against the darkness.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fox, with a flashlight that throws the image of an arrow,\r\npointed out the stars as they appeared over the dome. The coming of\r\nMars forecast the dawn of May 10 and in a few moments the sun emerged\r\nfrom the proper latitudinal position out of the lake and blazed its\r\nway across the heavens and set behind the silhouette of the Standard\r\nOil Building on the west wall of the dome in less than a minute,\r\ndenoting that the day had passed in review. At 3:43 P. M. central\r\nstandard time, the midget moon arose and sailed its course and then\r\nset behind the darkened picture of the Straus Tower.\r\n\r\nThen Professor Fox ran off Sunday, Monday and Tuesday for good\r\nmeasure, each time with Mars heralding the dawn and the sun changing\r\nposition as it does in reality. Fifty centuries of astronomical\r\nhistory can be run off in an hour by the machine. The planets are\r\nvisible during the day in the planetarium as well as night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moon Weed\r\n\r\n_By Harl Vincent_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bart hacked and hacked at the rubbery growth._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unwittingly the traitor of the Earth, Van pits himself\r\nagainst the inexorably tightening web of plant-beasts he has released\r\nfrom the moon.]\r\n\r\nHobart Madison pursed his lips in a whistle of incredulous surprise as\r\nhe regarded the object that lay in the palm of his hand. An ordinary\r\npebble, it seemed to be, but a pebble in which a strange fire\r\nsmouldered and showed itself here and there through the dull surface.\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind repeating what you just said, Van?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You heard me the first time. I say that that's a diamond and that it\r\ncame from the moon.\" Carl Vanderventer glared at his friend in\r\nresentment of his doubting tone.\r\n\r\n\"Mean to tell me you've been there? To the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. I'm not a Jules Verne adventurer. But I'm telling you\r\nthat stone is a diamond of the first water and that it came from the\r\nmoon. Weighs over a hundred carats, too. You can have it appraised\r\nyourself if you think I'm kidding you.\"\r\n\r\nBart Madison laughed. \"Don't get sore, Van,\" he said. \"I'm not\r\ndoubting your word. But Lord, man--the thing's so incredible! It takes\r\na little time to soak in. And you say there are more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. This one's the largest of five I've found so far. And there's\r\nother stuff, too. Wait till you see. Fossils, beetles and things. I\r\ntell you, Bart, the moon was inhabited at one time. I've the evidence\r\nand I want you to be the first to see it.\" The eyes of the young\r\nscientist shone with excitement as he saw that his friend was roused\r\nto intense interest.\r\n\r\n\"So that's what all your experimenting has been aimed at. No wonder it\r\ncost so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you've been a brick for financing me. Never asked a\r\nquestion, either. But Bart, it'll all come back to you now. Know how\r\nmuch that stone's worth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty, I guess. But, forget about the financing and all that.\r\nWhere's this laboratory of yours?\" Madison had pushed his chair back\r\nfrom his desk and was reaching for his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Over in the Ramapo Mountains, not far from Tuxedo. I'll have you\r\nthere in two hours. Sure you can spare the time to go out there now?\"\r\nVanderventer was enthusiastically eager.\r\n\r\n\"Spare the time? You just try and keep me from going!\"\r\n\r\nNeither of them noticed the sinister figure that lurked outside the\r\ndoor which led into the adjoining office. They chattered excitedly as\r\nthey passed into the outer hall and made for the elevator.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVanderventer's laboratory was a small domed structure set in a\r\nclearing atop the mountain and well hidden from the winding road which\r\nwas the only means of approach. Though Bart Madison, who had inherited\r\nhis father's prosperous brokerage business, had financed his friend's\r\nresearch work ever since the two left college, this was his first\r\nvisit to the secluded workshop, and its wealth of equipment was\r\nrevealed to him as a complete surprise. He had always thought of Van's\r\nexperiments as something beyond his ken; something uncanny and\r\nmysterious. Now he was convinced.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent single piece of apparatus in the laboratory was a\r\ntwelve-inch reflecting telescope which reared its latticed framework\r\nto a slit in the dome overhead. Paralleling its axis and secured to\r\nthe same equatorial mounting was a shining tube of copper which\r\nbristled with handwheels and levers and was connected by heavy\r\ninsulated cables to an amazing array of electrical machinery that\r\noccupied an entire side of the single room.\r\n\r\n\"Regular young observatory you've got here, Van,\" Bart commented when\r\nhe had taken all this in in one sweeping glance of appraisal.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, and then some. Not another like it in the world.\" Van was\r\nbusying himself with the controls of his electrical equipment, and a\r\npowerful motor-generator started up with a click and a whirr as he\r\nclosed a starting switch.\r\n\r\nMadison watched in silence as the swift-fingered scientist fussed with\r\nthe complicated adjustments of the apparatus and then turned to the\r\nmassive concrete pedestal on which his telescope was mounted. At his\r\ntouch of a button the instrument swung over on its polar axis to a new\r\nposition. The slit in the dome was opened to the afternoon sky,\r\nrevealing the lunar disc in its daytime faintness.\r\n\r\n\"You can see it just as well in daylight?\" Bart asked as his friend\r\npeered through the eyepiece of the telescope and continued his\r\nadjustments.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, the surface is just as bright as at night. Doesn't seem so to\r\nyour eye, but it's different through the telescope. Here, take a\r\nlook.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBart squinted through the eyepiece and saw a huge crater with a\r\nshadowed spire in its center. Like a shell hole in soft earth it\r\nappeared--a great splash that had congealed immediately it was made.\r\nThe cross-hairs of the eyepiece were centered on a small circular\r\nshadow near its inner rim.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" Van was saying, \"is a prominent crater near the Mare Nubium.\r\nThe spot under the cross-hairs is that from which I have obtained the\r\ndiamonds--and other things. Watch this now, Bart.\"\r\n\r\nThe young broker straightened up and saw that his friend was removing\r\nthe cover from a crystal bowl that was attached to the lower end of\r\nthe copper tube that pointed to the heavens at the same ascension and\r\ndeclination as the telescope. The air of the room vibrated to a\r\nstrange energy when he closed a switch that lighted a dozen vacuum\r\ntubes in the apparatus that lined the wall.\r\n\r\n\"You say you bring the stuff here with a light ray?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, I said with the speed of light. This tube projects a ray of\r\nvibrations--like directional radio, you know--and this ray has a\r\ncomponent that disintegrates the object it strikes and brings it back\r\nto us as dissociated protons and electrons which are reassembled in\r\nthe original form and structure in this crystal bowl. Watch.\"\r\n\r\nA misty brilliance filled the bowl's interior. Intangible shadowy\r\nforms seemed to be taking shape within a swirling maze of ethereal\r\nlight that hummed and crackled with astounding vigor. Then, abruptly,\r\nthe apparatus was silent and the light gone, revealing an odd object\r\nthat had taken form in the bowl.\r\n\r\n\"A starfish!\" Bart gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, and fossilized.\" Van handed it to him and he took it in his\r\nfingers gingerly as if expecting it to burn them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thing was undoubtedly a starfish, and of light, spongy stone. Its\r\ncolor was a pale blue and the ambulacral suckers were clearly\r\ndiscernible on all five rays.\r\n\r\n\"Lord! You're sure this is from the moon?\" Bart turned the starfish\r\nover in his hand and gazed stupidly at his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, you nut. Think I had it up my sleeve? But here, watch\r\nagain, there's something else.\"\r\n\r\nThe crackling, misty light again filled the bowl.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" Bart ventured, \"you bring in something large--big as a\r\nhouse, let's say. What would it do to your machine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't. The ray'll only pick up stuff that'll enter the bowl.\r\nLook--here's the next arrival.\"\r\n\r\nThe mysterious light died down and the scientist picked up the second\r\nobject with trembling fingers. It was a knife of beautiful\r\nworkmanship, fashioned from obsidian and obviously the work of human\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"There! Didn't I tell you?\" Van gloated. \"Guess that shows there were\r\nliving beings on the moon.\"\r\n\r\nHe made minute changes in the adjustment of his marvelous instrument\r\nand Bart watched in dazed astonishment as object after object\r\nmaterialized before their eyes. There were fragments of strange\r\nminerals; more fossils, marine life, mostly; a roughly beaten silver\r\nplate; three diamonds, none of which was as large as what Van had\r\ntaken to New York, but all of considerable value.\r\n\r\n\"This'll be something for the papers, Van!\" Bart Madison was visioning\r\nthe fame that was to come to his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, all but the diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"All but the diamonds is right!\"\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken by a sarcastic voice, chill as an icicle, that\r\ncame from the open door. They wheeled to look into the muzzles of two\r\nautomatic pistols that were trained on them by a stocky individual who\r\nfaced them with a twisted, knowing grin.\r\n\r\n\"Danny Kelly!\" Bart gasped, raising his hands slowly to the level of\r\nhis shoulders. He knew the ex-army captain was a dead shot with the\r\nservice pistol, and a desperate man since his disgrace and forced\r\nresignation. \"What's the big idea?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to ask. Refused me a loan this morning, didn't you?\r\nNow I'm getting it this way.\" Kelly turned savagely on Van, prodding\r\nhis ribs with a pistol. \"Get 'em up, you!\" he snapped.\r\n\r\nVan had been slow in raising his hands, gaping in stupefied amazement\r\nat the intruder. Now he reached for the ceiling without delay.\r\n\r\n\"You'll serve time for this, Danny!\" Bart shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up! I know what I'm doing. And back up, too--where--no, the\r\nother door.\" Kelly was forcing him toward the door of the cellar at\r\nthe point of one pistol as he kept Van covered with the other.\r\n\r\nBart clenched his fist and brought it down in a sudden sweeping blow\r\nthat raked Kelly's cheek and ear with stunning force. But the gunman\r\nrecovered in a flash, dropped the muzzle of his pistol and pulled the\r\ntrigger. Drilled through the thigh, Bart staggered through the open\r\ndoor and fell the length of the stairs into the darkness of the\r\ncellar. Kelly laughed evilly as he slammed the door and turned the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\n\"Hold it, you!\" he snarled as he swung on Van who had dropped his\r\nhands and crouched for a spring. \"If I drill you, it won't be through\r\nthe leg. I'll take those diamonds now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe pocketed one of his pistols, and, keeping the other pressed to the\r\npit of Van's stomach, went through his pockets. Then he added those on\r\nthe tray by the crystal bowl to the collection, and transferred the\r\nentire lot to his own pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you clever engineer,\" he grinned, \"we'll just operate this trick\r\nmachine of yours for a while and collect some more. Hop to it!\" He\r\nwatched narrowly as Van stretched his fingers to the controls. \"No\r\nmonkey business, either,\" he grated; \"you'll not change a single\r\nadjustment. I've been listening to you and I know the clock of the\r\ntelescope is keeping the ray trained on the same spot. You just\r\noperate the ray and nothing else. Get me?\"\r\n\r\nVan did not think it expedient to tell him of the drift caused by\r\ninaccuracies in the clock and perturbations of the moon's motion. He\r\nwas playing for time, trying to plan a course of action.\r\n\r\n\"There may not be any more diamonds,\" he offered as he tripped the\r\nrelease of the ray.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there'll be more. Don't try to kid me.\"\r\n\r\nAn irregular block of quartz materialized in the bowl and Kelly tossed\r\nit to the floor in savage disgust. Then a small diamond, very small;\r\nbut he pocketed it nevertheless. The next object was a strange one--a\r\ndried seed pod about six inches in length and of brilliant red color.\r\nThe ray had shifted to a new position on the lunar surface. Another\r\nand another of the strange legumes followed, one of them bursting open\r\nand scattering its contents, bright red like the enclosing pod to\r\nrattle over the floor like tiny glass beads. Kelly snorted his\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\"Still some sort of vegetation out there,\" Van muttered. The eternal\r\nscientist in the man could not be downed by a mere hold-up.\r\n\r\n\"Can the chatter!\" Kelly snarled as the crystal bowl gave up another\r\nof the useless pods and still another. He gathered up the evidence of\r\nlunar vegetation, a half dozen of the pods, and threw them through the\r\nopen doorway with a savage gesture. \"You trying to put one over on\r\nme?\" he bellowed.\r\n\r\n\"How can I?\" Van retorted mildly. \"I haven't touched a handwheel.\" He\r\nwas wondering vaguely whether this lunar seed would grow in earthly\r\nsoil; what sort of a plant it would produce under the new environment.\r\n\r\nKelly was becoming nervous now. It seemed that little was to be gained\r\nby hanging around this crazy man's laboratory. He had a sizable\r\nfortune in rough stones already. That big one alone, when properly cut\r\ninto smaller stones, would make him independent. Maybe there weren't\r\nany more, anyway. And the longer he stayed the greater chance there\r\nwas of getting caught.\r\n\r\nThe advent of another of the pods decided him. A quick blow with the\r\nbutt of his pistol stretched Van on the floor and Kelly fled the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBart was pounding furiously on the cellar door when Van first took\r\nhazy note of his surroundings. Several uncertain minutes passed before\r\nhe was able to stagger across the room and release his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" Bart demanded, swaying on his feet and blinking in the\r\nsudden light.\r\n\r\n\"Gone. Socked me and beat it with the diamonds.\" Van was mopping the\r\nblood from his eyes with a handkerchief. \"Are you hit bad?\" he\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"No, just a flesh wound. Hurts like the devil, though. How about\r\nyourself?\" Bart limped to his side and sighed with relief when he\r\nexamined his bleeding scalp. \"Not so bad yourself, old man. Where's\r\nyour first aid kit?\"\r\n\r\nVan was still somewhat dazed and merely pointed to the cabinet. \"Fine\r\npair we turned out to be!\" he grumbled after his head had cleared a\r\nbit under Bart's vigorous cleansing of the cut on his temple. \"Here we\r\nstood, meek as a couple of lambs, and let that guy get away with\r\nmurder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but those forty-fives made the difference. Ouch!\" Bart winced\r\nas his friend poured fresh iodine over the wound in his leg. \"Have a\r\nheart, will you?\"\r\n\r\nThey were startled into silence by a hoarse, strangled scream that\r\ncame from outside the laboratory. \"Help! Help!\" someone repeated in a\r\npanicky voice--a voice which at once ended on a gurgled note of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\"It's Kelly!\" Bart whispered. \"He's come back. Something's happened to\r\nhim.\" He started for the open door.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute. It may be a trick to get us outside where he can pop\r\nus off.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't. For God's sake, look!\" Bart had reached the door and\r\nwas pointing at the ground with shaking forefinger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe entire clearing seemed to be alive with wriggling things--long\r\nrubbery tentacles that crawled along the ground, reaching curling ends\r\nhigh in the air and had even started climbing the trees at the edge of\r\nthe clearing. Blood red they were, and partially transparent in the\r\nlight of the setting sun; growing things, attached by their thick ends\r\nto swelling mounds of red that seemed anchored to the ground.\r\nTranslucent stalks rose from the mounds and sprouted huge buds that\r\nburst and blossomed into flaming flowers a foot in diameter, then\r\nwithered and went to seed in a moment of time. But always the weaving\r\ntendrils shot forth with lightning speed, reaching and feeling their\r\nuncanny way along the ground and over tree stumps into the woods. One\r\nof them emerged from a hollow stump with its slender end coiled around\r\nthe tiny body of a chattering gray squirrel.\r\n\r\n\"The moon flowers!\" Van cried.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--moon flowers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dried seed pods. They came over into the bowl, and Kelly threw them\r\nout. Now look at the damned things. They're alive!\"\r\n\r\nKelly's voice came to them once more from behind the barrier of\r\nrapidly growing vegetation. \"Help!\" he screeched. \"I'll give back the\r\ndiamonds--anything! Only get me away from the things!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ought to let 'em get him,\" Van growled.\r\n\r\nBart shivered. \"Too horrible, Van. Got an ax or anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a hatchet around back. Maybe we can--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the young broker had scuttled around the corner of the building\r\nand Van looked after him anxiously. The vile red tendrils were\r\nreaching for the east wall of the laboratory, and he saw that their\r\ninner surfaces were covered with tiny suckers like those on the arms\r\nof a devil-fish. Carnivorous plants, undoubtedly, these awful\r\nhalf-animal, half-vegetable things whose seed had been transported\r\nacross a quarter million miles of space. Man eaters! Deadly, and\r\ngrowing with incredible speed. Even the short-lived flowers were\r\nfearsome, as they opened their scarlet pansy-like faces and stared a\r\nmoment before they folded up and shriveled into the seed cases like\r\nthose that had materialized in the crystal bowl.\r\n\r\nThen he noticed that the pods were opening and spreading more of the\r\nterrible seed. Nothing could stop this weird growth, now. It would\r\ncover the country like a sea of flaming horror, overcoming and\r\ndevouring every living thing. Cold fear clutched at Van as he realized\r\nthe enormity of the calamity that had come to the earth.\r\n\r\nBart was skirting the edge of the clearing with the hatchet in his\r\nhand, and Van tried to call out to him, to warn him. But his voice\r\ncaught in his throat, and instead he ran to his assistance, circling\r\nthe spreading menace to get around behind where Kelly was still\r\nshouting. Damn Kelly anyway! This never would have happened if he\r\nhadn't come on the scene!\r\n\r\nKelly was in the woods, wedged into the crotch of a tree and striking\r\nwildly at the clutching tendrils with his clubbed pistol. They mashed\r\neasily and dripping red, but were not to be deterred from their\r\nghastly purpose. Kelly's time would have indeed been short had not his\r\nerstwhile victims come to the rescue. One of the thickest of the\r\ntwining things encircled his body and had him pinned to the tree. His\r\nbreath was coming in gasps as its tightening coils increased their\r\npressure. His coarse features were livid and his eyes bulged from\r\ntheir sockets.\r\n\r\nBart hacked and hacked at the rubbery growth until he had him free;\r\njerked him from his perch, blubbering and whining like a schoolboy.\r\nHis shirt had been torn from his breast and they saw a great red welt\r\nwhere the blood had been drawn through the pores by those terrible\r\nsuckers.\r\n\r\n\"Look out, Bart!\" Van shouted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother of the creeping things had come through the underbrush and was\r\nwrapping its coils around Bart's ankle. Another and another wriggled\r\nthrough, and soon they were battling for their own freedom. Kelly\r\nstaggered off into the woods and went crashing down the hill, leaving\r\nthem to take care of themselves as best they might.\r\n\r\nThe stench of the viscous liquid that oozed from the injured tendrils\r\nwas nauseous; it had something of a soporific effect; and the two\r\nfriends found themselves fighting the terror in a growing mist of red\r\nthat blinded and confused them. Then, miraculously, they were free and\r\nVan assisted Bart as they ran through the forest. When they reached\r\nthe road, weak and out of breath, they were just in time to see\r\nKelly's roadster vanish around the bend.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, he'd give back the diamonds--the swine!\" Van muttered\r\nvindictively. Then, shrugging his shoulders, \"Well, they won't be much\r\ngood to him, anyway. Wouldn't be any good to us either, as far as that\r\ngoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Aren't they real?\" Bart was raising himself\r\npainfully into the seat of Van's car, his wounded leg suddenly very\r\nmuch in the way.\r\n\r\n\"Sure they're real. But don't you realize what this thing means--this\r\nungodly growth that's started?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--why, no. You mean it'll keep on growing?\"\r\n\r\n\"And how! Those inner stalks drop a new batch of seeds every five\r\nminutes or so. Presto!--a flock of new plants spring up ten feet from\r\nthe first; dozens of them for every pod that drops. You know how\r\ngeometrical progression works out. They'll cover the whole\r\ncountry--the whole world. Lord!\"\r\n\r\n\"Man alive, this is terrible! I hadn't thought of that before. What'll\r\nwe do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that's the question: what can we do?\" Van started his motor and\r\njerked the car to the road. \"First off, we're going to get away from\r\nhere--fast!\"\r\n\r\nBart gripped his arm as he shifted into second gear. \"Look, Van!\" he\r\nbabbled. \"They're out of the woods already. Loose! The red snakes are\r\nloose from their stalks. They're alive, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\nIt was true. Several of the slimy red things were wriggling their way\r\nover the macadam like great earthworms, but moving with the speed of\r\nhurrying pedestrians. Free, and untrammeled by the roots and stems of\r\nthe mother plants, they had set forth on their own in the search for\r\nbeings of flesh and blood to destroy. Millions of their kind would\r\nfollow; billions!\r\n\r\nIn sudden panic Van stepped on the gas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later, with shrieking siren, a motorcycle drew\r\nalongside and forced them to the curb. \"Where's the fire?\" the\r\nsarcastic voice of a stern-visaged officer demanded, when Van had\r\nbrought his car to a screeching stop. Seventy-five, the speedometer\r\nhad read but a moment before.\r\n\r\n\"It's life and death, officer,\" Van started to explain. \"We must get\r\nto the proper officials to warn the--\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, tell it to the judge! Come on now, follow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But officer, there's death on its way from the hills, I tell you.\r\nRed, creeping things that'll be here in a couple of hours--\"\r\n\r\n\"Get away, from that wheel. I'll drive you in meself. You're fulla\r\napplejack.\"\r\n\r\nBart had opened the door on his side and was limping his way around\r\nthe back of the car. This was serious. They had to get away; had to\r\nspread the word in a way that would be believed before it was too\r\nlate. The officer was tugging at Van's arm, astonishment and black\r\nrage showing in his weather-beaten countenance. Speeding, drunk,\r\nresisting an officer--they'd never get out of this mess! A swift\r\nuppercut interrupted the proceedings. Bart's leg was numb and stiff,\r\nbut his good right arm was working smoothly and with all its old time\r\nprecision. His second punch was a haymaker. With his full weight\r\nbehind it, it drove straight to the chin and stretched the officer on\r\nthe concrete. Thoughtfully, Bart removed his pistol from its holster\r\nbefore scrambling in at Van's side.\r\n\r\n\"Boy, now we're in for it!\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"And we might as well make a good job while we're at it.\" Van let in\r\nhis clutch with a jerk, and again they were breaking all traffic\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was dusk when they roared in through the gate at the Rockland\r\nCounty Airport and pulled up at the hangar office. Van rushed in,\r\nshouting for Bill Petersen, and Bart followed. A slender, fair-haired\r\nyouth in rumpled flying togs greeted them.\r\n\r\n\"Bill, my friend, Bart Madison,\" Van blurted without pausing for\r\nbreath. \"Listen, we've got to have a plane right away. Got one with a\r\nradio?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what's all the rush? Where you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Albany. Right away. Make it snappy, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, but what's it all about?\" Young Petersen was leading them to\r\nthe field where a sleek mono-plane was in waiting as if they had\r\nordered it. \"Warm her up, Joe,\" he called to the mechanic.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Bill--I never lied to you, did I?\" Van asked, when they were\r\nseated in the plane's cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Not that I know of. But sometimes I've thought you were lying, until\r\nI saw with my own eyes the things you had told me about. What is it\r\nthis time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Death and destruction. Coming down out of the Ramapos. We've got to\r\nwarn the country. Plants, Bill--squirmy red plants with long feelers\r\nthat can twist around a man and devour him. Half animal, they are, and\r\nthe feelers break loose and crawl by themselves. Multiplying like\r\nnothing you ever saw. Millions of them in an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Petersen stared incredulously as his motor roared into life.\r\nThen he gave his attention to the business of taking off. He jerked\r\nthe thumb of his free hand toward the radio.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVan's expert fingers manipulated the switches and dials of the\r\nportable apparatus, and its vacuum tubes glowed into life. \"2BXX\r\ncalling 2TIM,\" he droned into the microphone.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" Bart asked. The drone of the motor was barely audible in\r\nthe closed cabin and did not interfere.\r\n\r\n\"The _Times_. Trying to get Johnny Forbes. If anyone can get this\r\nthing across, he can. Wait a minute, here they are.\" He closed his\r\neyes as he listened to the murmuring voice in the headphones.\r\n\r\nThen he was talking rapidly, forcefully, and the young flyer gazed\r\nwith owlish solemnity at Bart as they listened to his conversation. It\r\nwas plain that Bill was but half inclined to believe, though impressed\r\nby the earnestness and evident apprehension displayed by his two\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, 2BXX,\" Van was saying. \"Connect me with Johnny Forbes,\r\nplease--in a hurry. Yes.... Hello, Johnny, it's Van--Carl\r\nVanderventer, you know. Yes; got a scoop for you, but first I want you\r\nto get it in the broadcasts. Get me? It's about a man-eating plant\r\nthat's starting to overrun the country. No--listen now, I'm not\r\ndreaming--listen--\"\r\n\r\nThe frantic scientist rambled on and on about the seed from the moon,\r\nthe red death that was creeping down from the mountains, the horror of\r\nthe calamity as he and Bart had visioned it. Then, with a sudden note\r\nof despair, his voice trailed off into nothingness and he turned a\r\ndrawn white face to his two friends.\r\n\r\n\"Laughed at me. Hung up on me,\" he groaned. \"Good God! We've got to do\r\nsomething--quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be in Albany in an hour,\" the pilot suggested. \"What you going to do\r\nthere?\" He believed, now. His expression of horror showed it.\r\n\r\n\"See the governor. But, man, it's an hour wasted! We must stir up the\r\ncountry--get the word to Washington--everywhere. It might be possible\r\nto fight the things some way if we can mobilize State and National\r\nresources quickly enough. Bill, Bart, what can we do?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plane sped on through the night under control of her gyro-pilot as\r\nthe three men racked their brains for a solution of the problem. If a\r\nhard-boiled newspaper man would not believe the story, who could?\r\n\r\n\"I've got it!\" Bart shouted suddenly. \"Can either of you pound a\r\nkey--code, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I can. Then what?\" Petersen returned.\r\n\r\n\"Fake an S. O. S. Don't you see? All broadcasting has to stop, and\r\nevery ship at sea, every air liner in this part of the country'll be\r\nlistening--standing by. Give 'em the story in code. Let 'em think\r\nwe're in a ship from the moon--captured by Lunarians who are here to\r\ndestroy the world with this weed of theirs--anything. Make it as weird\r\nas possible. Most everyone'll think it's a hoax, but there are ten\r\nthousand kids--amateurs--who'll be listening in. Somebody'll believe\r\nit, and, believe me, there'll be some investigating in the\r\nneighborhood of the growth in no time.\"\r\n\r\n\"By George, I believe that'll do it!\" Van exclaimed. \"And the\r\nbroadcasters listen in for an S. O. S. themselves. Got to, you know,\r\nso they know when to start up again. Some smart announcer will tell\r\nthe story--maybe even believe it. The trick will work, sure as\r\nshooting!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pilot glanced at his instruments and saw that the automatic\r\ngyro-apparatus was functioning properly. Then he moved over to the\r\nradio and threw the switch that put the key in circuit instead of the\r\nmicrophone. Rapidly he ticked off the three dots, three dashes, and\r\nagain three dots that spelled the dread danger signal of the air. Over\r\nand over he repeated the signal, and then he listened for results.\r\n\r\n\"It worked!\" he gloated, after a moment. \"They're all signing off--the\r\nbroadcasters. The Navy Yard in Brooklyn gives me the go-ahead.\"\r\n\r\nHe pounded out the absurd message with swift fingers, pausing\r\noccasionally to ask a pertinent question of Van or Bart. At Van's\r\nrequest he added a warning to all residents of New York State west of\r\nthe Hudson River and of northern New Jersey to flee their homes\r\nwithout delay. He even asked that the message be relayed to the\r\ngovernors of the two states, and that Governor Perkins of New York be\r\nadvised that they were on their way to Albany to discuss the\r\nsituation. But he balked at the story of the Lunarians, telling\r\ninstead the equally strange truth regarding the origin of the deadly\r\ngrowth, and adding the names of Van and Bart to lend authenticity to\r\nthe tale.\r\n\r\nThen he signed off and switched the radio receiver to the loud speaker\r\nbefore returning to the pilot's seat.\r\n\r\nBart tuned in on the various broadcasters as they resumed their\r\nprograms, finally settling on WOR, Newark, whose announcer was\r\nreading the strange message to his radio public with appropriate\r\ncomment. A crime and an outrage he called it, an affront to the\r\nindustry and to the public. An insult to the government of the United\r\nStates. But wait! A telephone call had just been received at the\r\nstation from the village of Sloatesburg. A reputable citizen of that\r\ntown had reported the red growth at the edge of the State road--huge\r\nred earthworms wriggling across the concrete. Another call, and\r\nanother! The announcer's voice was rising hysterically.\r\n\r\n\"It _did_ work, Bart,\" Van exulted. \"Now the hell starts popping.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGovernor Perkins met them in person when they arrived at the Municipal\r\nAirport in Albany. A great crowd had gathered in the shadows outside\r\nthe brilliance of the flood lights, and a police escort rushed them to\r\nthe governor's private car.\r\n\r\n\"Here's where you go to the Bastille for socking that cop,\" Van\r\nobserved. His spirits had risen appreciably since that successful S.\r\nO. S. call.\r\n\r\nBut the governor was in a serious mood, as they made their way toward\r\nthe executive mansion through the milling crowds that lined the hilly\r\nstreets of the capital city of New York State. Proofs had not been\r\nlacking of the truth of Bill Petersen's radio warning. Already the\r\nspreading red death had covered a circle some eight miles in diameter,\r\ncovering farm lands and destroying the crops, blocking the roads and\r\ntrapping many on the streets and in their homes in nearby towns. More\r\nthan a hundred had lost their lives, and thousands were fleeing the\r\nthreatened area. The country was in an uproar.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" the governor said, when they had reached the privacy of\r\nhis chambers, \"this is a serious matter, and no time must be lost in\r\ndealing with it. Nevertheless, I want you, Mr. Vanderventer, to tell\r\nyour story of the thing to me and to the radio system of the United\r\nStates Secret Service. The President himself will be listening, as\r\nwill the chief executives of most of the states. Hold nothing back, as\r\nthe fate of our people is at stake.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo Van faced the microphone and related the history of his work in the\r\nlittle laboratory in the Ramapo Mountains. He told of his interest in\r\nthe earth's satellite, and of his first unsuccessful experiments with\r\nultra-telescopes in the endeavor to explore its surface close at hand;\r\nof the failure of a space-ship he had built; of the final discovery of\r\nthe ray, by means of which it was possible to transport solid objects\r\nfrom the one body to the other. He told of the discovery of man-made\r\nrelics and of fossils; he told of the diamonds, and of the attack by\r\nDan Kelly which had resulted in the spreading of the seed of the\r\ndeadly moon weed. He even related the incident of the traffic\r\npoliceman, at which the governor smiled.\r\n\r\n\"That has been reported,\" he said, \"and you need have no fear on that\r\nscore.--The charges will be dropped. I now ask that you give us your\r\nopinion as to the best method of combatting this new enemy. Have you\r\nany ideas?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not, sir,\" Van replied gloomily, \"though I believe it can be\r\ndone only from the air. Possibly bombing, or a gas of some sort--I\r\ndon't know. It will take time, Mr. Governor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and meanwhile the thing is overwhelming us at what rate?\"\r\n\r\n\"As nearly as I can estimate it, the growth is moving with a speed of\r\nfour or five miles an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"By morning you expect it will have traveled forty or fifty miles in\r\nall directions?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\"\r\n\r\nA sharp buzz from the instrument on the governor's desk interrupted\r\nthem. \"The President,\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"That is enough, Governor,\" came the husky tones of President Alford's\r\nvoice. \"I shall communicate with Secretary Makely at once. All\r\navailable army bombing-planes will be rushed to the scene. You, sir,\r\nwill mobilize the militia, as will the governors of the other states.\r\nMeanwhile, this young scientist is to report to the Bureau of\r\nScientific Research in Washington--to-night. Have him bring a supply\r\nof these seeds with him.\"\r\n\r\nThat was all. Governor Perkins offered no comment, but merely rose\r\nfrom his seat to indicate that the discussion was ended. A solemn\r\nsilence reigned in the room.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go!\" exclaimed Bill Petersen suddenly, unawed by the presence\r\nof the governor. \"My ship's waiting, and we can stop off for a couple\r\nof those pods and still make Washington in two hours. Come on!\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Perkins smiled. \"Good luck, boys,\" he said, as they were\r\nushered from the room. \"My car will return you to the airport. And\r\nremember, the country will be watching you now, and expecting much\r\nfrom you. Good-by.\"\r\n\r\nThey were to recall his words in the dark days ahead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore they had reached Newburgh, they saw a dull red glow in the\r\nskies that told them the news broadcast to which they had been\r\nlistening had not exaggerated. The red growth was luminous in\r\ndarkness. Off there to the south-west, it was as if a vast forest fire\r\nwere lighting the heavens. No wonder the panics and rioting were\r\ngetting out of control of the police!\r\n\r\nComing up over Bear Mountain, they caught their first glimpse of the\r\nsea of fire that was the red death by night. Like a vast bed of\r\nglowing embers it covered the countryside, extending eastward to\r\nHaverstraw where it was temporarily halted by the broad Hudson. It was\r\na shimmering, undulating mass of living, luminous things, eating their\r\nhorrible way through all organic matter that stood in their path.\r\nWrithing, squirming, all-absorbing monsters that sent out an advance\r\nguard of independent snake-like tendrils to capture and hold for the\r\nlagging mother-plants whatever of live stock and humanity they were\r\nable to find.\r\n\r\n\"Think they'll get over the river, Van?\" Bart asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure they will. Every fugitive who had a narrow escape after being in\r\ncontact with the things is a potential carrier of the seed. I found\r\nseveral of them sticking to my clothing after we got away. I picked a\r\ncouple off your coat, but didn't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord! What did you do with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Put them in the ash receiver in my car--like a fool. Wouldn't have to\r\ngo down for more if I'd kept them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it can't be helped now. We'll have a job getting some down\r\nthere now, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say so.\" Van lapsed into gloomy silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were over the landing field above Tomkins Cove, and Bill turned\r\non the siren whose raucous shriek operated the mechanism of the\r\nfloodlight switches by sound vibrations. The field sprang into instant\r\nillumination, and they circled it once before swooping to a landing.\r\nThey were but a mile from the advancing terror.\r\n\r\nThe field was deserted, and the three men started off immediately in\r\nthe direction of the oncoming weed.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to make it snappy,\" Van grunted. \"We've got about twelve\r\nminutes to get the pods and get back to the ship. The damn things'll\r\nbe here by that time.\"\r\n\r\nThey scrambled over fences and pushed through thickets. The lighted\r\nwindows of a deserted farmhouse were directly ahead, and they ran\r\nthrough the open gate and across the fields. Ever, the glow of the\r\nweed grew brighter. A terrified horse galloped wildly past them and\r\ncrashed into the fence, whinnying piteously as it went down with a\r\nbroken leg. They could see the red rim of the advancing horror just\r\nbeyond the road.\r\n\r\nOne of the detached tendrils slithered past, each glowing coil\r\ndistinctly visible.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky the things can't see!\" Bart shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Van. \"Have to dodge 'em to get in close enough to one of\r\nthe plants. Keep your eyes peeled now, you fellows, in case one of us\r\ngets caught.\"\r\n\r\nA terrific explosion rocked the ground. They had paid no heed to the\r\nroaring of motors overhead. The bombers were on the job! Shooting\r\nskyward, a column of flame not a hundred yards from them showed where\r\nthe high explosive had landed in the red mass. Then, slimy wriggling\r\nthings rained all about them, fragments of the red weed that still\r\nsquirmed and crawled and clung. Bill Petersen yelled and clutched at\r\nhis neck where one of the things had taken hold.\r\n\r\nAnother warning whistle of a falling bomb. Crash! More of the horror\r\nraining down and splattering as it fell. Whistle--crash! A huge blob\r\nof quivering, luminous jelly fell before them--a portion of one of the\r\nmother-plants. Crash! Crash!\r\n\r\n\"Run!\" Van shouted. \"Run for the plane. We'll never make it now. Damn\r\nthose bombers, anyway!\"\r\n\r\nAll along the advancing front, the bombs were bursting, shattering the\r\nair with their detonations and scattering the glowing red stems and\r\ntendrils in all directions. The din was appalling, and the increasing\r\nbrightness of the crimson glow added to the horror of the situation.\r\nStumbling and cursing, they ran for the plane.\r\n\r\n\"Fools! Fools!\" Bill was shouting. \"Can't they see the field and the\r\nplane? Why in the devil are they dropping them so near?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen Bart was down, clawing at a three-foot length of red tendril that\r\nhad fallen on him and borne him to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Bart! Bart!\" Van turned back and was tearing at the thing with\r\nfingers that were slippery with the sap that oozed from its torn skin.\r\nMonstrous earthworms! Cut them apart and each portion lived on, took\r\non new vigor. And these vile things could sting like a jellyfish!\r\nWhere each sucker touched the skin a burning sore remained.\r\n\r\nBill helped them break away from the thing, and all three fought on\r\ntoward the lights of the landing field. Only a short way off now; it\r\nseemed they would never reach it. The bombers were dropping their\r\nmissiles with unceasing regularity, and the red death only spread the\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\nWhen they scrambled into the cabin of the plane, the red wall of\r\ncreeping horror was almost upon them. Advancing speedily out from the\r\nred-lit darkness, it seemed to halt momentarily, when it emerged into\r\nthe brilliance of the great arc-lights which illuminated the field.\r\nThen, more slowly and with seemingly purposeful deliberation, the\r\nwriggling feelers reached out from the mass and bore down upon them.\r\nBill slammed the door and latched it, then fumbled frantically with\r\nthe starter switch. A most welcome sound was the answering roar of\r\nthe motor.\r\n\r\nThe pilot yanked his ship into the air, taking off with the wind\r\nrather than running the risk of remaining on the ground long enough to\r\ntaxi around and head into it. The plane acted like a frightened bird\r\nas Bill struggled with the controls, darting this way and that, and\r\nonce missing a crash by inches as the tail was lifted by the\r\ntreacherous ground wind. Then they were clear, and slowly gained\r\naltitude in a steep climb.\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" Van exclaimed, mopping his red-splattered forehead with his\r\nhandkerchief. \"That was a narrow squeak, boys. And we haven't got the\r\nseeds yet--unless we can find a few on our clothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who said so?\" Bart gloated. \"Look at this.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened his clenched fist and disclosed one of the pods, unbroken\r\nand gleaming horribly scarlet in the dim light of the cabin. Bill\r\nheaved a sigh of relief as he banked the ship and swung around toward\r\nthe south. He had dreaded another landing near the sea of moon weed.\r\nVan chortled over their good fortune as he examined the mysterious\r\npod. One good thing the bombers had done, anyway! Blew one of the\r\nthings into his friend's hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBart and the young pilot found themselves very much out of the picture\r\nwhen they reported with Van at the Research Building in Washington.\r\nThe Government had no use for them in this emergency: it was the\r\nscientist they wanted, and he was immediately rushed into conference\r\nwith the heads of the Bureau. His two friends were left to shift for\r\nthemselves, and they joined the crowds in the street.\r\n\r\nThe name of Carl Vanderventer was on everyone's tongue. Cursing and\r\nreviling him, they were, for the hare-brained experiment which had\r\nbeen the cause of the terrible disaster. Fools! Bart seethed with rage\r\nand nearly came to blows with a number of vociferous agitators who\r\nwere advocating a necktie-party. Why hadn't the officials published\r\nthe entire story as Van told it over the Secret Service radio? There\r\nwas no mention of Dan Kelly in the broadcast news, nor of the fact\r\nthat the police were searching for him in every city and town in the\r\ncountry. Another instance of the results of secrecy in governmental\r\nactivities!\r\n\r\n\"We'd better find ourselves a room and turn in,\" Bart growled. \"Let's\r\nget out of this mob before I slam somebody.\"\r\n\r\nBill Petersen was only too willing. He was suddenly very tired.\r\n\r\nIn the Willard Hotel they were assigned to an excellent room, and Bart\r\ninsisted on switching on the broadcasts and listening to the news. Far\r\ninto the night he sat by the loud-speaker, or paced the floor as an\r\nexceptionally calamitous happening was reported. But Bill slept\r\nthrough it all.\r\n\r\nThe army bombers had been recalled. Their efforts had worked more harm\r\nthan good. The invincible moon weed now had crossed the Hudson River\r\nat Nyack and Piermont. Tarrytown was overrun, and many of the\r\ninhabitants had lost their lives either in the maws of the insatiable\r\nmonsters or in the panics and rioting that accompanied the evacuation\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNew Jersey was covered as far south as New Brunswick, and west to\r\nPhillipsburg and Belvidere. At Mauch Chunk the contents of twenty oil\r\ntanks had been diverted to the Delaware River, and the floating oil\r\nfilm was proving at least a temporary protection to a considerable\r\nportion of the state of Pennsylvania. In New York State the growth\r\nhad buried hill and valley, town and village, as far as Monticello,\r\nand, along the Hudson, extended as far north as Kingston. At\r\nPoughkeepsie, on the opposite side of the river, frantic householders\r\nhad armed themselves with rifles and shotguns, and were killing off\r\nall refugees who attempted to land from boats at that point. But the\r\nmilitia was on guard at the bridges, assuring safe crossing to the\r\nthousands who fled the red death over these routes. There was no\r\nkeeping the seed of the moon weed from finding its way east.\r\n\r\nAt some points fire had been used with considerable success as a\r\nbarrier, hundreds of acres of forest lands being destroyed in the\r\nendeavor to stem the crimson tide. But, after the ashes were cool,\r\ngermination would recur, and the weed would continue on its triumphant\r\nway. Acid sprays and poison-gas of various kinds had been tried\r\nwithout appreciable effect. The casualty estimates already ran into\r\nthe tens of thousands; rumor had it that nearly one hundred thousand\r\nhad lost their lives in the city of Newark alone. There was no way in\r\nwhich the figures could be checked while everything was in a state of\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nCommunication lines were broken, roads blocked, gas and electric\r\nsupply systems paralyzed and the railroads helpless. Trains could not\r\nbe driven through the glutinous, wriggling mass that piled high on the\r\ntracks. Only the radio and the air lines were operative in the\r\nstricken area, and even these were of little value to the unfortunates\r\nwho, in many cases, were surrounded and cut off from all hope of\r\nsuccor.\r\n\r\nAt four in the morning, with aching heart and reeling brain, Bart\r\nthrew himself on the bed without undressing and fell into the troubled\r\nsleep of exhaustion and despair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day brought no encouragement, though it was reported that the\r\ngrowth developed with less rapidity after sunrise than it had during\r\nthe night. Bart endeavored to get Van on the telephone, but was curtly\r\ninformed by the operator at the Research Building that no incoming\r\ncalls could be transferred to the laboratory where he was working.\r\nKnowing his friend, he pictured him as working feverishly with the\r\nGovernment engineers and giving no thought to sleep or food. He'd kill\r\nhimself, sure! But such a death, even, was preferable to the red one\r\nof the moon weed.\r\n\r\nThe Canadians and Mexicans had been quick to protect their borders and\r\nforbid the landing of any American aircraft or the passage of trains\r\nand automobiles. But the seed had reached Europe, one of the\r\ntwelve-hour night air-liners having carried a thousand refugees who\r\nhad sufficient foresight and the means to engage passage. It was a\r\nworld catastrophe they faced!\r\n\r\nBy mid-afternoon the streets of Washington were almost deserted. It\r\nwas less than twenty-four hours since the first moon seed took root,\r\nand already the crimson growth had progressed nearly a hundred miles\r\nsouthward from the point of origin! Another twenty or thirty hours and\r\nit would reach the capital city--unless Van and those engineers over\r\nin the Research Building discovered something; a miracle.\r\n\r\nBart tried the telephone once more and was overjoyed when the\r\noperator, all apologies now, informed him that Van had been trying to\r\nreach him for several hours.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, old man,\" his friend's voice came over the wire: \"I've been\r\nworried as the devil not knowing where you were. I want you and Bill\r\nto stick around where I can get you at any time. I may need you. Where\r\nare you staying?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Willard. Have you doped out something?\" Bart answered in quick\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe. Can't let anything out yet--not till we've tested it\r\nthoroughly. But I can tell you that a hundred factories are already\r\nworking on machines we've devised. By good luck it only means minor\r\nchanges to an apparatus that is on the market in large quantity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great stuff. The city's nearly emptied itself, you know, and, boy,\r\nhow they've been razzing you over the radio and in the papers--howling\r\nfor your hide, the whole country.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know.\" Van's voice was calm, but Bart sensed in it something of a\r\ncold fury that was new to him in his friend. The young scientist was\r\nbitterly resentful of the attitude of the public.\r\n\r\n\"Can we see you, Van?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nor call me either. Better hang around the hotel and wait for a\r\ncall from me. So long now, Bart. I've got to get busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"So long.\"\r\n\r\nBart gazed solemnly at Bill Petersen, who had been listening\r\nabstractedly to the one-sided conversation. Bill had given up hope and\r\nwas resigned to the inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"Says he may need us, Bill,\" said Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah? Well, we'll be ready for anything he wants us to do. It's no\r\nuse though--anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--no use? You never saw Van licked yet, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I did. By his super-telescopes and the rocket ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is different.\" Bart was a staunch defender of his friend. He\r\nglared at Bill for a moment and then switched on the news broadcast\r\nwhich he knew he detested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe progress of the moon weed continued unabated. In the city of New\r\nYork a million souls were reported as having lost their lives, and\r\nthis in spite of the difficulty experienced by the uncanny moon weed\r\nin obtaining a foothold in Manhattan. It had been thought that the\r\nasphalt and concrete would prove an effective barrier, and so they did\r\nfor a time. But, with the seed active in the parks and along the water\r\nfronts, it was not long before the powerful roots of the greedy plants\r\nworked their way underneath, ripping up pavements and wriggling into\r\ncellars as they progressed. The city was a mass of wreckage and a\r\nmaelstrom of fighting, dying humanity.\r\n\r\nWhole regiments of the National Guard were wiped out as they fought\r\noff the weed with ax and bayonet, in the effort to provide time for\r\nthe refugees to clear from their homes in certain localities. All\r\ntransportation facilities to the south and west were taxed to the\r\nutmost. There was fighting and killing for the possession of\r\nautomobiles and planes and for room in trains and buses. Air-line\r\nterminals and railroad stations were the scenes of dreadful massacres\r\nas the police and military guards fought off the crazed and desperate\r\ncreatures who attacked them en masse. And still the news announcers\r\nprated of the responsibility of one Carl Vanderventer.\r\n\r\nThe telephone bell rang, and Bart answered it in relief. At last they\r\nwere to see some action! But no, it was merely the desk clerk,\r\nnotifying him that all employees were leaving the hotel and that they\r\nwould be left to shift for themselves. Yes, there was plenty of food\r\nin the kitchens; they were welcome to it. And a permanent telephone\r\nconnection would be made to their room. The frightened clerk wished\r\nthem luck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn endless monotone, the voice of the news announcer droned on.\r\nBinghamton and Elmira, Albany and Schenectady, New Haven,\r\nPhiladelphia, Allentown--all had succumbed. The casualty estimates now\r\nran into the millions. The mist, the red mist that rose from the\r\nsteaming weed, was drifting westward and spreading the seed with ever\r\nincreasing rapidity. For now the monstrous growth from out the sky was\r\nadapting itself to its environment; providing the seed with feathery\r\ntufts that permitted the winds to carry them far and wide like the\r\nseed of a dandelion.\r\n\r\n\"Turn off that damn thing!\" Bill shouted. And he jumped to his feet,\r\nhis eyes glinting strangely in the twilight gloom of the room. Bill\r\nwas close to the breaking point.\r\n\r\n\"Guess you're right,\" Bart mumbled. \"Not good for either of us to\r\nlisten to that stuff.\" He switched off the receiver, and they sat in\r\nsilence as darkness fell over the city.\r\n\r\nBill shivered and felt for the button of the electric light which he\r\npressed with a trembling finger. They blinked in the sudden\r\nillumination, but it cheered them somewhat. It was not good to sit in\r\nthe darkness and think. Besides, they knew that the turbine generators\r\nof Potomac Edison were still running. Some brave souls were sticking\r\nto their jobs--for a time, at least.\r\n\r\n\"God!\" Bill suddenly groaned, after an endless time of dead silence.\r\n\"My sister! Lives in Pittsburgh, you know. Wonder if she and the kids\r\ngot away. It won't be long before the damn stuff gets there.\"\r\n\r\nBart thanked his lucky stars that he had no family ties. \"Oh, they've\r\nhad plenty of warning,\" he tried to console Bill. \"Hours, you know;\r\nand the westbound lines are in good shape from there. I wouldn't worry\r\nabout them if I were you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was utter silence once more. Even the customary street noises\r\nwas lacking. Both men jumped nervously when the shrill siren of a\r\npolice motorcycle sounded in the distance. Bart thought grimly of his\r\nfracas with the officer who had tried to arrest Van. How long ago that\r\nseemed, and how inconsequential an incident!\r\n\r\nTheir windows faced north, and by midnight they could make out the red\r\nglow of the moon weed, that awful band of flickering crimson that\r\npainted the horizon the color of blood. The telephone clamored for\r\nattention and Bill stifled a hysterical sob as the terrifying sound\r\nbroke the eery stillness.\r\n\r\nVan was on the way to get them! He had a Government car and they were\r\nto go to Arlington for Bill's plane. Then what? He refused to commit\r\nhimself: they must follow him blindly. Anything was better than this\r\ninactivity, though. Bart shouted with glee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We're going north,\" Van replied shortly, in answer to Bart's question\r\nwhen they entered the official car in front of the hotel, \"after Dan\r\nKelly.\"\r\n\r\n\"After Dan Kelly? Got a line on him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Secret Service reports him in Toronto. The Canucks are after him\r\nnow, but, by God, I'm going to get him myself!\"\r\n\r\nVan was haggard and wan, his eyes gleaming with a fanatical light. The\r\nstrain had done something to him--something Bart didn't like at all.\r\nThis was a different Van from the man who had entered his office two\r\ndays previously. Unshaven and unkempt, he looked and talked like a\r\ndrunken man on the verge of delirium tremens.\r\n\r\n\"What's the idea, Van?\" he asked gently.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to get him. I tell you. The scum! It's his fault the whole\r\nworld's against me. I'll get him, Bart; I'll kill him with my bare\r\nhands!\"\r\n\r\nSo that was it! The combination of gruelling labor in the effort to\r\nsave mankind from the dread moon weed, and bitter censure from the\r\nvery people he was trying to save, had been too much for Van. He had\r\ndeveloped a fixation, unreasoning and murderous; he'd get even with\r\nthe man who had caused the trouble. And nothing could deter him from\r\nhis purpose: Bart could see that. Might as well humor him and help\r\nhim. It made little difference, anyway, with the red doom spreading at\r\nits present rate. They'd all be victims in a few days.\r\n\r\nThey were speeding through the streets of Washington at a break-neck\r\nrate. Van bent over the wheel, and like a demented man glued his\r\nwildly staring eyes to the road.\r\n\r\n\"What about your work?\" Bart asked, after a while. \"Has anything been\r\naccomplished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes and no. They'll be ready to shoot in a few hours. Don't know\r\nwhether it'll be a complete success or not. But I sneaked away anyhow.\r\nThis other thing's more important to me right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the dope? Can you tell us now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. I've got one of the machines in the car and I'll explain when\r\nwe're on our way to Canada.\"\r\n\r\nThis wasn't like Van. Never secretive and always in good humor, he was\r\ntreating his friends like annoying strangers.\r\n\r\n\"You can't land in Canada,\" Bill ventured, as they pulled up at the\r\ngate of the airport.\r\n\r\n\"Like hell I can't! You watch my smoke, and let any bloody Canuck up\r\nthere try and stop me!\"\r\n\r\nHe was lifting a small black case from the luggage carrier of the car\r\nas he replied. Bart silenced the airman with a look.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen they had taken off and were well under way, Van opened his black\r\ncase and set a vacuum-tube apparatus in operation. They were nearing\r\nthe fringe of the glowing sea of red that was the vast blanket of moon\r\nweed. It now extended to within a few miles of Baltimore and stretched\r\nnorthward as far as the eye could see.\r\n\r\n\"It was a cinch,\" Van was explaining. \"When I first saw that the\r\ngrowth slowed up under the arc-lights at Tomkins Cove it gave me the\r\nglimmering of an idea. Then, on the following day, when we learned\r\nthat the weed spread more slowly in sunlight, I was convinced. The\r\nstuff is dormant on the moon, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Bart asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Because there is no atmosphere surrounding the moon, and the sun's\r\nrays are not filtered before they reach its surface as they are here.\r\nThe invisible rays, ultra-violet and such, are present in full\r\nproportion. And the moon weed can not flourish when subjected to light\r\nof the higher frequencies. It died out when the moon lost its\r\natmosphere, and only revived on being brought to earth--probably a\r\nmillion times more prolific in our dense and damp atmosphere and rich\r\nsoil. The thing's a cinch to dope out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah!\" Bart commented drily. Van was now talking and he could have\r\nbitten off his tongue for interrupting him.\r\n\r\nThis machine of Van's was a generator of invisible light in the\r\nultra-indigo range, Van explained. You couldn't see its powerful beam,\r\nbut they had proved in the laboratory that it was certain doom to the\r\nmoon weed. They had grown the stuff from seed in steel cages, and\r\nplayed with it until they were all satisfied. Now would come the final\r\ntest. Ten thousand planes were being equipped with the new generator,\r\nwhich was merely an adaptation of standard directional television\r\ntransmitters, and to-night these would start out to fight the weed. It\r\nwas a cinch!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeneath them the red cauldron seethed and tossed as they sped\r\nnorthward; the crimson blanket of death that was steadily covering the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Drop to a thousand feet, Bill,\" the scientist called, \"and then watch\r\nbelow. But, don't slow down. We've got to get to Toronto!\"\r\n\r\nThe ship nosed down and soon leveled off at the prescribed altitude.\r\nVan's vacuum tubes lighted to full brilliancy, and a black spot\r\nappeared on the glowing surface just beneath them, a black spot that\r\nextended into a streak as the plane continued on its way. They were\r\ncutting a swath of blackness fifty feet wide through the heart of the\r\ngrowth!\r\n\r\n\"See that!\" Van gloated. \"It's killing them by millions! And the best\r\nof it is the effect it leaves behind. The soil is permeated to a depth\r\nof several inches and the stuff will not germinate in the spots where\r\nthe ray has contracted. Oh, it works to perfection!\"\r\n\r\nBill was exuberant; his hopes revived miraculously. He gave his motor\r\nthe gun and got out of it every last revolution that it could turn up.\r\nHe must get Van to Canada! Not such a bad idea, this going after\r\nKelly, at that!\r\n\r\nBart was voluble in his praise, then caught himself short as he\r\nremembered that he had doubted Van but a half hour previously: doubted\r\nhim and despaired. Now Van, lapsing into gloomy silence after his\r\ntriumph, was again thinking of nothing but revenge. The getting of Dan\r\nKelly meant more to him now than the extinction of the moon weed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen they landed at the Toronto Airport they were welcomed with open\r\narms instead of with rifle fire as Bill had anticipated. The news had\r\ngone forth. Already a thousand planes flying over the United States\r\nwere driving back the sea of destruction. The invisible ray was a\r\nsuccess, and the name of Carl Vanderventer was now a thing with which\r\nto conjure, rather than one on which to heap imprecation and insult.\r\nVan grimaced wryly at this last bit of news.\r\n\r\nDanny Kelly? No one at the airport had ever heard of him. Van\r\ntelephoned in to the city; to Police Headquarters. Yes, they had\r\napprehended the fugitive American at the request of Washington, but he\r\nwas a slippery customer. He had escaped. Van raged and fumed.\r\n\r\nOf what use were the congratulations of the night flyers who still\r\nloitered in the hangar; of what consolation the radio reports of the\r\nsuccess of the ultra-indigo ray in the States and in Europe? He had\r\ncome after his man and he'd failed. Defeat was a bitter pill.\r\n\r\nThe news broadcasts from the States were jubilant and became\r\nincreasingly so during the night. The moon weed was being driven back\r\non a wide front and by morning would be entirely surrounded. There\r\nwould be no further loss of life and little more destruction of\r\nproperty. Carl Vanderventer had saved the day! Van grunted his disgust\r\nwhenever an announcer mentioned his name.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight came they prepared to return. Little use there was of\r\nsearching the highways and byways of Canada for the fugitive. He'd\r\nsimply have to wait until the Canadians were able to get a line on Dan\r\nKelly again.--It was maddening! But Bart was glad. The light of reason\r\nwas returning to his friend's eyes in the reaction.\r\n\r\nThen there was a telephone call from the city for Van. Police\r\nHeadquarters wanted him. The fanatical glint returned to his eyes when\r\nhe ran for the hangar to answer the call. Perhaps they had already\r\ncaptured Kelly! And he had an order in his pocket for the man's\r\nreturn to the States. He'd been made a deputy, and with Kelly released\r\nto him anything might happen. Something would happen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the police were reporting the unexplainable reappearance of the\r\nmoon weed just outside the city limits at a point near Cookesville.\r\nWould Mr. Vanderventer be so kind as to fly over there and destroy it\r\nbefore any lives were lost? He would.\r\n\r\nThe growth had covered an acre of ground by the time they reached the\r\nspot designated. But it was the work of only a minute to blast it out\r\nof existence with the ultra-indigo ray. Van surveyed the blackened and\r\nshriveled mass with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Let's land and take a look at it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBart thought he saw a look of exultation flash over his careworn\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nSoon they were wading deep in the blackened remains of the moon weed.\r\nThe stems and tendrils snapped and crumbled into powder as they passed\r\nthrough. The stuff was done for, no question of that.\r\n\r\nBill Petersen yelled and pointed a shaking forefinger at an object\r\nthat lay in the blackened ruin. It was a human skeleton, the bones\r\nbare of flesh and gleaming white in the light of the early morning\r\nsun. Van was on his knees, quick as a flash, feeling around the\r\ngrewsome thing: pawing at the shreds of clothing that remained.\r\n\r\nThen he was on his feet, his face shining with unholy glee. In his\r\nhands were a half dozen small, smooth objects which looked like\r\npebbles. The diamonds!\r\n\r\n\"I thought so!\" he exclaimed. \"It's Kelly. Only way the seed could\r\nhave gotten up here. He had some on his clothes and didn't know it. I\r\ncouldn't get him myself--but anyway I'm satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe staggered and would have fallen, had not Bart caught him in his\r\narms. Poor old Van! Nearly killed him, this thing had, but he'd be\r\nhimself again, after it was all over. No wonder he'd gone out of his\r\nhead with the horror of it, and the blame that had been so cruelly\r\nlaid on him! No wonder he'd become obsessed with this idea of getting\r\nsquare with Dan Kelly! But now he was content: sleeping like a babe in\r\nBart's arms.\r\n\r\nTenderly they carried him to the plane and laid him out on the\r\ncushions in back. They'd let him sleep as long as he could; return him\r\nto Washington where he'd receive his just dues in recognition for his\r\nservices. Then would follow the work of reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation. Van would glory in that.\r\n\r\nBart regarded his sleeping friend thoughtfully as they winged their\r\nswift way toward the American border. The harsh lines that had showed\r\nin his face during the past few hours were smoothed away and in their\r\nplace was an expression of deep contentment. He was at peace with the\r\nworld once more. Good old Van.\r\n\r\nWhat a difference there would be when he awakened to full realization\r\nof the changed order of things! What satisfaction and relief!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Advertisement]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Port of Missing Planes\r\n\r\n_By Captain S. P. Meek_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"That portion of the wall has gone back in time\r\nexactly three seconds,\" he announced._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the underground caverns of the Selom, Dr. Bird once\r\nagain locks wills with the subversive genius, Saranoff.]\r\n\r\nSo that's the \"Port of Missing Planes,\" mused Dick Purdy as he looked\r\ndown over the side of his cockpit. \"It looks wild and desolate all\r\nright, but at that I can't fancy a bus cracking up here and not being\r\nfound pronto. Gosh, Wilder cracked in the wildest part of Arizona and\r\nhe was found in a week.\"\r\n\r\nThe mail plane droned monotonously on through perfect flying weather.\r\nPurdy continued to study the ground. Recently transferred from a\r\nwestern run, he was getting his first glimpse of that section of ill\r\nrepute. Below him stretched a desolate, almost uninhabited stretch of\r\ncountry. By looking back he could see Bellefonte a few miles behind\r\nhim, but Philipsburg, the next spot marked on his map, was not yet\r\nvisible. Twelve hundred feet below him ran a silver line of water\r\nwhich his map told him was Little Moshannon Run. As he watched he\r\nsuddenly realized that the ground was not slipping by under him as\r\nrapidly as it should. He glanced at his air-speed meter.\r\n\r\n\"What the dickens?\" he cried in surprise. For an hour his speed had\r\nremained almost constant at one hundred miles an hour. Without\r\napparent cause it had dropped to forty, less than flying speed. He\r\nrealized that he was falling. A glance at his altimeter confirmed the\r\nimpression. The needle had dropped four hundred feet and was slowly\r\nmoving toward sea-level.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith an exclamation of alarm, Purdy advanced his throttle until the\r\nthree motors of his plane roared at full capacity. For a moment his\r\nair-speed picked up, but the gain was only momentary. As he watched,\r\nthe meter dropped to zero, although the propellers still whirled at\r\ntop speed. His altimeter showed that he was gradually losing\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and looked over the side of his plane. The ground below\r\nhim was stationary as far as forward progress was concerned, but it\r\nwas slowly rising to meet him. He fumbled at the release ring of his\r\nparachute but another glance at the ground made him hesitate. It was\r\nnot more than three hundred feet below him.\r\n\r\n\"I must be dreaming!\" he cried. The ground was no longer stationary.\r\nFor some unexplained reason he was going backward. The motors were\r\nstill roaring at top speed. Purdy dropped back into his seat in the\r\ncockpit. With his ailerons set for maximum lift he coaxed every\r\npossible revolution from his laboring motors. For several minutes he\r\nstrained at the controls before he cast a quick glance over the side.\r\nHis backward speed had accelerated and the ground was less than fifty\r\nfeet below him. It was too close for a parachute jump.\r\n\r\n\"As slow as I'm falling, I won't crack much, anyway,\" he consoled\r\nhimself. He reached for his switch and the roar of the motors died\r\naway in silence. The plane gave a sickening lurch backwards and down\r\nfor an instant. Purdy again leaned over the side. He was no longer\r\ngoing either forward or back but was sinking slowly down. He looked at\r\nthe ground directly under him. A cry of horror came from his lips. He\r\nsat back mopping his brow. Another glance over the side brought an\r\nexpression of terror to his white face and he reached for the heavy\r\nautomatic pistol which hung by the side of the control seat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"He cleared Bellefonte at nine in the morning, Dr. Bird\" said\r\nInspector Dolan of the Post Office Department, \"and headed toward\r\nPhilipsburg. He never arrived. By ten we were alarmed and by eleven we\r\nhad planes out searching for him. They reported nothing. He must have\r\ncome to grief within a rather restricted area, so we sent search\r\nparties out at once. That was two weeks ago yesterday. No trace of\r\neither him or his plane has been found.\"\r\n\r\n\"The flying conditions were good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect. Also, Purdy is above suspicion. He has been flying the mail\r\non the western runs for three years. This is his first accident. He\r\nwas carrying nothing of unusual value.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any local conditions unfavorable to flying?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all. It is much uninhabited country, but there is no reason\r\nwhy it shouldn't be safe country to fly over.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some damnably unfavorable local conditions, Doctor,\r\nalthough I can't tell you what they are,\" broke in Operative Carnes of\r\nthe United States Secret Service. \"Dick Purdy was rather more than an\r\nacquaintance of mine. After he was lost I looked into the record of\r\nthat section a little. It is known among aviators as 'The Port of\r\nMissing Planes.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it get a name like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the number of unexplained and unexplainable accidents that\r\nhappen right there. Dugan of the air mail, was lost there last May.\r\nThey found the mailbags where he had dropped them before he crashed,\r\nbut they never found a trace of him or his plane.\"\r\n\r\n\"They didn't?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a trace. The same thing happened when Mayfield cracked in August.\r\nHe made a jump and broke his neck in landing. He was found all right,\r\nbut his ship wasn't. Trierson of the army, dropped there and _his_\r\nplane was never found. Neither was he. He was seen to go down in a\r\nforced landing. He was flying last in a formation. As soon as he went\r\ndown the other ships turned back and circled over the ground where he\r\nshould have fallen. They saw nothing. Search parties found no trace of\r\neither him or his ship. Those are the best known cases, but I have\r\nheard rumors of several private ships which have gone down in that\r\ndistrict and have never been seen or heard of since.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bird sat forward with a glitter in his piercing black eyes. Carnes\r\ngave a grunt of satisfaction. He knew the meaning of that glitter. The\r\nDoctor's interest had been fully aroused.\r\n\r\n\"Inspector Dolan,\" said Dr. Bird sharply, \"why didn't you tell me\r\nthose things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Doctor, we don't like to talk about mail wrecks any more than\r\nwe have to. Of course, the loss of so many planes in one area is\r\nmerely a coincidence. Probably the wrecked planes were stolen as\r\nsouvenirs. Such things happen, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" said Dr. Bird sharply. He raised one long slender hand\r\nwith beautifully modeled tapering fingers and threw back his unruly\r\nmop of black hair. His square, almost rugged jaw, protruded and the\r\nglitter in his eyes grew in intensity. \"No souvenir hunting vandals\r\ncould cart away whole planes without leaving a trace. In that case,\r\nwhat became of the bodies? No, Inspector, this has gone beyond the\r\nrange of coincidence. There is some mystery here and it needs looking\r\ninto. Fortunately, my work at the Bureau of Standards is in such shape\r\nthat I can safely leave it. I intend to devote my entire time to\r\nclearing this matter up. The ramifications may run deeper than either\r\nyou or I suspect. Please have all of your records dealing with plane\r\ndisappearances or wrecks in that locality sent to my office at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe Post Office inspector stiffened.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Dr. Bird,\" he said formally, \"we are very glad to hear any\r\nsuggestion that you may care to offer. When it comes, however, to a\r\nmatter of surrendering control of a Post Office matter to the\r\nDepartment of Commerce or to the Treasury Department, I doubt the\r\npropriety. Our records are confidential ones and are not open to\r\neveryone who is curious. I will inform the proper authorities of your\r\ndesire to help, but I doubt seriously if they will avail themselves of\r\nyour offer.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bird's black eyes shot fire. \"Idiot!\" he said. \"If you're a\r\nspecimen of the Post Office Department, I'll have the entire case\r\ntaken out of your hands. Do you mean to cooperate with me or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fail to see what interest the Bureau of Standards can have in the\r\naffair.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bureau isn't mixed up in it; Dr. Bird is. If necessary, I will go\r\ndirect to the President. Oh, thunder! What's the use of talking to\r\nyou? Who's your chief?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chief Inspector Watkins is in charge of all investigations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carnes, get him on the telephone. Tell him we are taking charge of\r\nthe investigation. If he balks, have Bolton go over his head. Then get\r\nthe chief of the Air Corps on the wire and arrange for an army plane\r\nto-morrow. There is something more than a mail robbery back of this or\r\nI'm badly fooled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suspect--\"\r\n\r\n\"I suspect nothing and no one, Carnes--yet! I'll get a few instruments\r\ntogether to take with us to-morrow. We'll fly over that section until\r\nsomething happens if it takes us until this time next year.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA three-seated scout plane rose from Langley Field at eight the next\r\nmorning. Captain Garland was at the controls. In the rear cockpit sat\r\nDr. Bird and Carnes. Inside his flying helmet, the doctor wore a pair\r\nof headphones which were connected to a box on the floor before him.\r\nCarnes carried no apparatus but his hand rested carelessly on the grip\r\nof a machine-gun.\r\n\r\nThe plane cleared Bellefonte at nine-thirty and bore east toward\r\nPhilipsburg. Captain Garland kept his eyes on his instrument board and\r\non a map. Less than six hundred feet above the ground, he was\r\nfollowing the air-mail route as exactly as possible. Overhead a mail\r\nplane winged its way east, three thousand feet above them.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes brought them to Philipsburg. Captain Garland shot his\r\nplane upward a few hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\"Turn back, Captain,\" said Dr. Bird into the speaking tube. \"Retrace\r\nyour course a quarter of a mile farther north. At Bellefonte, turn\r\nback and go over the same ground another quarter of a mile north. Keep\r\nflying back and forth, working your way north, until I tell you to\r\nstop.\"\r\n\r\nThe plane swung around and headed back toward Bellefonte.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we can't tell exactly what route he followed,\" said the\r\ndoctor to Carnes, \"but he was new on this run and it is safe to assume\r\nthat he didn't stray far. We'll quarter the whole area before we\r\nstop.\"\r\n\r\nCarnes watched the ground below them carefully. There was nothing\r\nabout it to distinguish it from any other wooded mountainous country\r\nand his interest waned. He glanced aloft. The mail plane had\r\ndisappeared in the distance and the sky was clear of aircraft. He\r\nturned again to the ground. It looked closer than it had before. He\r\nturned and looked at the duplicate altimeter. The plane had lost\r\nnearly a hundred feet elevation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"There's something wrong about this plane, Doctor,\" came Captain\r\nGarland's voice through the speaking tube. \"It doesn't behave like it\r\nshould.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess we've found what we were looking for, Carnes,\" said Dr. Bird\r\ngrimly. \"What seems to be the matter, Captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessed if I know,\" was the answer. \"It feels like a drag of some\r\nsort, like an automobile going through heavy sand. We're slowing down,\r\nthough I am giving her all the gun I've got!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut your motor!\" said the doctor shortly. He bent over the duplicate\r\ninstrument board as the roar of the motor died away. Carnes rose and\r\nlooked over the side.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Doctor!\" he cried in a strained voice. Directly below them\r\nyawned a hole sixty feet in diameter and extending down into the\r\nbowels of the earth. The plane hovered over the hole for a moment and\r\nthen slowly descended into it.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" cried the detective.\r\n\r\n\"It's the secret of the Port of Missing Planes,\" replied Dr. Bird.\r\n\"Throw off your parachute. Keep your gun and light handy but don't\r\nfire unless I do first. The same holds good for you, Captain.\"\r\n\r\nThe plane sunk until it was fifty feet below the level of the ground.\r\nCarnes looked up. Gradually the circle of sky became blurred and hazy\r\nas though the air were heavy with dust. The rasp of Dr. Bird's\r\nflashlight key aroused him and he hastily wound his own. The haze\r\nabove them grew thicker. Suddenly the light died and then came\r\ndarkness, a darkness so thick and absolute that it bore down on them\r\nlike a weight. Dr. Bird's light stabbed a path through it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were in a tunnel or tube reaching into the ground. The sides were\r\nsmooth and polished, as though water worn. The plane sank deeper and\r\ndeeper into the earth. Suddenly Dr. Bird's light went out.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Doctor?\" asked Carnes, \"did your light fail?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" came a strained voice. \"I turned it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Light yours.\"\r\n\r\nCarnes reached into his pocket. Dr. Bird could hear his breath come in\r\npanting sobs as though he were exerting his whole strength.\r\n\r\n\"I can't do it, Doctor,\" he gasped. \"I want to, but some power greater\r\nthan my will prevents me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you affected, Captain?\" asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I--can't--move,\" came in muffled accents from the front cockpit.\r\n\r\n\"Some power beyond my knowledge has us in its grasp,\" said the doctor.\r\n\"All we can do is sit tight and see what happens. We are no longer\r\nfalling at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the forward cockpit came a rustling sound. There was a slight jar\r\nin the ship, and it gave as though a weight had been applied to one\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, Garland?\" asked the doctor sharply.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. Again came the rustling sound. The ship gave a\r\nsudden lurch as though a weight had left the side. Carnes suddenly\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Doctor,\" he said. \"I'm going over the side.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been fighting it but I'm going myself in a minute,\" replied\r\nthe doctor grimly. \"Something is pulling me over. It's the same power\r\nthat keeps me from turning on my light.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's perfectly safe to go over,\" said Carnes suddenly. \"The plane is\r\nresting on a solid base.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the same feeling. Catch hold of my belt and let's go.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey climbed over the side of the plane and dropped to the ground.\r\nTheir descent made absolutely no sound. Dr. Bird stopped and felt the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"Crepe rubber, or something of the sort,\" he murmured. \"At any rate,\r\nit's noise and vibration proof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now what?\" asked Carnes.\r\n\r\n\"This way,\" replied the doctor confidently. \"I'm beginning to get the\r\nhang of understanding this. The way is perfectly level and open before\r\nus. Keep your hand on my shoulder and step right out.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know where we're going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't, but something tells me that the road is level and open. It\r\nis the same thing that brought us over the side. I can't explain it\r\nbut it is some sort of a telepathic control exerted by an\r\nintelligence. Whether the sending mind is reinforced by instruments I\r\ndon't know, but I rather fancy not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Garland?\"\r\n\r\n\"He went off in another direction. I could feel the power that guided\r\nhim although it was not directed at us. Something tells me that he is\r\nsafe for the present.\"\r\n\r\nFor half a mile they made their way through the darkness before they\r\nstopped. This time Carnes could plainly understand the command which\r\ncame to both of them.\r\n\r\n\"There is a table before us,\" said Dr. Bird. \"Lay your flashlight and\r\npistol on it.\"\r\n\r\nCarnes struggled against the order but the power guiding him was\r\nstronger than his will. He strove to turn on his light. When he could\r\nnot, he tried to cock his pistol. With a sigh, he laid his gun and\r\nlight on the table before him. Without words, the two men walked\r\nforward a few feet and sat confidently down on a bench that something\r\ntold them was there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment they sat quietly. A cry, choked in the middle, came from\r\nthe detective's throat. Cold clammy hands touched his face. He strove\r\nagain to cry out, but his voice was paralyzed. The hands went\r\nmethodically over his body, evidently searching for weapons. Mustering\r\nup his will, Carnes made a grab for one of them. His captor apparently\r\nhad no objection to the detective's action for Carnes seized the hand\r\nwithout effort. But he almost dropped it. The hand was as large as a\r\nham. He reached for the other hand but could not locate it. A movement\r\non the part of his captor brought it to him and he made the startling\r\ndiscovery that the palms were directed outward. The hand had only four\r\nfingers, which were armed with long curved claws instead of nails.\r\nCarnes ran his hand up the palm to search for a thumb but found none.\r\nHe found, however, that, while the hands were naked, the wrists were\r\ncovered with short thick fur.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor!\" he cried, \"there's--\"\r\n\r\nAgain came the overpowering will and his speech died away in silence.\r\nHe sat dumb and motionless while his captor moved over to Dr. Bird. A\r\nsecond animal came forward and felt the detective over. He was not\r\nallowed to move this time, nor was he while a third and fourth animal\r\nwent carefully over him. The four drew back some distance.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" whispered Carnes as the influence grew fainter.\r\n\r\n\"Shh!\" was the answer, and as the doctor's demand for silence was\r\nreinforced by another wave of the paralyzing power, Carnes had no\r\nchoice. As he sat there silent, the power which held him again seemed\r\nto grow less. He found that he could move his arms slightly. He edged\r\nforward to get his gun and light. Before he reached them, a beam of\r\nlight split the darkness. Dr. Bird stood, electric torch in hand,\r\nstaring before him.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of a few feet stood a group of half a dozen animals\r\nabout the height of a man as they stood erect on their short hind\r\nlegs. They were covered with heavy brown fur. Their lower limbs were\r\nthin and light, but their shoulders and forelegs were heavy and\r\npowerful. Their forepaws, which had the palms facing outward, were\r\narmed with the long wicked claws he had felt. No visible ears\r\nprotruded from the round skulls. Their heads appeared to rest between\r\ntheir shoulders, so short were their necks. Their muzzles were long\r\nand obtusely pointed. Through grinning jaws could be seen powerful\r\nwhite teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Talpidae!\" cried Dr. Bird. \"Carnes, they are a race of giant\r\nintellectual moles!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that they had no visible eyes, the creatures were\r\nstrongly affected by the light. They dropped on all fours and turned\r\ntheir backs to the scientist and the detective. Two of them scurried\r\naway down a long tunnel which opened from the room in which they\r\nstood. Dr. Bird turned his light up and swept the room. It was\r\nroughly circular, a hundred feet in diameter, with a roof ten feet\r\nhigh. Dozens of tunnels led off in every direction.\r\n\r\n\"Your light, Carnes, quick!\" cried the doctor in a strained voice.\r\nCarnes reached toward the table for his light. Before he could reach\r\nit he was frozen into immobility. From the corner of his eye he could\r\nwatch the doctor. Dr. Bird was struggling to bring the light back on\r\nthe moles which stood before them. Great beads of sweat stood out on\r\nhis forehead. Inch by inch he moved the light closer to his goal, but\r\nCarnes could see that his thumb was stealing up toward the switch\r\nbutton. His breath came in sobs. Suddenly the light went out.\r\n\r\nFor some time the two men sat motionless on the bench unable to speak\r\nor move. One of the moles stepped before them and gave a mental\r\ncommand. The two rose to their feet. For a mile or more they followed\r\ntheir guide, then, at a silent command, they turned to the right for a\r\nfew steps and stopped. In another moment, the numbing influence had\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right, Carnes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, right as can be. Doctor, what were those things? Where are we?\r\nWhat's it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll find out in time, I guess,\" replied the doctor with a chuckle.\r\n\"Carnes, isn't this the darnedest thing we've ever been through?\r\nCaptured half a mile underground by a race of giant talpidae before\r\nwhose mental orders we are as helpless as children. Did you understand\r\nany of their talk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk? I didn't hear any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, mental conversation then. They made no sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. All I understood was the orders I obeyed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I got a great deal of it,\" the doctor said. \"We are evidently in or\r\nnear a sort of central community of these fellows. They spoke;\r\nthought is a better word; they thought of doing away with us but\r\ndecided to wait until they consulted someone with more authority. You\r\nsee, we are not airplane pilots. Captain Garland was taken at once to\r\nthe place where they have other aviators imprisoned.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they want of pilots underground?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't quite get that. There was another thought that I am not\r\nsure that I interpreted correctly. If I did, there is some man of the\r\nupper world down here in a position of considerable authority among\r\nthem. He has some use for pilots, but what use, I don't know. We are\r\nto be held until he is consulted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who could it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only think of one man. Carnes, and I hope I'm wrong. I don't\r\nhave to name him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ivan Saranoff. We haven't heard of him or had any activity from him\r\nfor the last eight months. We know that he had a subterranean borer\r\nwith which he has penetrated deep into the earth. Isn't it possible\r\nthat he has, at some time in his explorations, come into contact with\r\nthese fellows and made friends with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's possible, Doctor, but I hoped we had killed him when we\r\ndestroyed his borer.\"\r\n\r\n\"So did I, but he seems to bear a charmed life. Several times we have\r\nthought him dead, only to have him show up with some new form of\r\ndevil's work. It is too much to hope that we have succeeded in doing\r\naway with him. Did you notice one thing? Those fellows were helpless\r\nwhile I held the light on them. The one which was holding us captive\r\ngot so interested in the discussion about our fate that he momentarily\r\nforgot us. That was when I got my light. Until I turned the light away\r\nfrom them, we were free men.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" answered the secret service man.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that. The next time we get a light on a bunch of them, hold\r\nthem in the beam until we can make terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we ever get hold of a light again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a light they didn't get, probably because I didn't think of it\r\nwhile they were around. It is one of those fountain pen battery\r\naffairs and they probably took it for a pen. I won't turn it on now,\r\npartly to save it and partly not to let them know we have it. Let's\r\nsee what our prison is like.\"\r\n\r\nThey felt their way around the room. It proved to be eight paces by\r\nten in size. Like the tunnels it was floored with crepe rubber or some\r\nsimilar substance which gave out no sound of footsteps, yet was firm\r\nunderfoot. The room was furnished with two beds, a table and two\r\nchairs. There was no sign of a door.\r\n\r\n\"That's that,\" exclaimed the doctor when they had finished their\r\nexploration. \"I'm hungry. I wonder when we eat. Hello, here comes one\r\nof the fellows now.\"\r\n\r\nCarnes made no reply. As the doctor's speech ended, a wave of mental\r\npower enveloped the room. One of the moles entered, moved over to the\r\ntable for an instant and then left the room. An earthly odor of\r\nvegetables pervaded the room.\r\n\r\n\"My question is answered,\" said the doctor. \"We eat now.\"\r\n\r\nHe moved to the table. On it had been placed dishes containing three\r\ndifferent types of roots. Two of them proved to be palatable, but the\r\nthird was woody and bitter. The prisoners made a hearty meal from the\r\ntwo they relished. For an hour they sat waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Here they come again!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"We are going before the\r\nperson I spoke of. Can't you get their thoughts?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I can't, Doctor. I can understand when I get a command, but aside\r\nfrom those times everything is a blank to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mental wave receiver, if that's what it is, must be attuned to a\r\ndifferent frequency than yours, for I can hear them talking to one\r\nanother. I guess I should say that I can feel them thinking to one\r\nanother. At any rate, they want us to follow. Come along, the road\r\nwill be open and level.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe doctor stepped out confidently with Carnes at his heels. For half\r\na mile they went forward. Presently they halted.\r\n\r\n\"We are in a big chamber here, Carnes,\" whispered the doctor, \"and\r\nthere is someone before us. We'll have some light in a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHis prophecy was soon fulfilled. A vague glimmer of light began to\r\nfill the cavern in which they stood. As it grew stronger they could\r\nsee a raised dais before them on which were seated three figures. Two\r\nof them were the giant moles. Each of the moles wore a helmet which\r\ncovered his head completely, with no sign of lenses or other means of\r\nvision. It was the central figure, however, which held the attention\r\nof the prisoners.\r\n\r\nSeated on a chair and regarding, them with an expression of sardonic\r\namusement was a man. Above a high forehead rose a thin scrub of white\r\nhair. Keen brown eyes peered at them from under almost hairless brows.\r\nThe nose was high bridged and aquiline and went well with his\r\nprominent cheekbones. His mouth was a mere gash below his nose, framed\r\nby thin bloodless lips. The lips were curled in a sneer, revealing\r\nyellow teeth. The whole expression of the face was one of revolting\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said the figure slowly, \"fate has been kind to me. My friends,\r\nDr. Bird and Operative Carnes have chosen to pay me a long visit. I\r\nam greatly flattered.\"\r\n\r\nThe thin metallic voice with its noticeable accent struck a familiar\r\nchord.\r\n\r\n\"Saranoff!\" gasped Carnes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Carnes, Saranoff. Professor Ivan Saranoff, of the faculty of\r\nSt. Petersburg once. Now merely Saranoff, the scourge of the\r\nbourgeois.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I hoped we had killed you,\" murmured Carnes.\r\n\r\n\"It was no fault of Dr. Bird's that he failed,\" replied the Russian\r\nwith an excess of malevolence in his voice. \"His method was a correct\r\none. Merely the fortuitous fact that we had just pierced one of the\r\ntunnels of the Selom, and I was away from my borer exploring it, saved\r\nme. You did me a good turn, Doctor, without meaning to. You destroyed\r\nan instrument on which I had relied. In doing so, you unwittingly\r\ndelivered into my hands a power greater than any I had dreamed of--the\r\nSelom.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can a mental cripple like you do with blind allies like them?\"\r\nasked Dr. Bird with a contemptuous laugh. The Russian half rose from\r\nhis seat in rage. For a moment his hand toyed with a switch before\r\nhim. The sardonic sneer came back into his face and he dropped back\r\ninto his seat.\r\n\r\n\"You nearly provoked me to destroy you, Doctor,\" he said, \"but cold\r\ncalculation saved you. Since you will never return to the upper world,\r\nsave when and as I decree, I have no objection to telling you. The\r\nSelom are not blind. Their eyes are under the skin as is the case with\r\nmany of the talpidae, but for all that they can see very well. Their\r\neyes function on a shorter wave than ours, a wave so short that it\r\nreadily penetrates through miles of earth and rock. This cavern is now\r\nflooded with it. Visible light, the light by which we see, is limited\r\nto their eyes, hence the helmets which you see. They can see through\r\nthose helmets as well as you or I can see through air.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you intend to do with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Doctor, there you hit me in a tender spot. I have a sore\r\ntemptation to close this switch on which my hand rests. Were I to do\r\nso, both you and Mr. Carnes would vanish forevermore. I have, however,\r\nconceived a very real affection for you two. Your brains, Doctor,\r\nworking in my behalf instead of against me would render me well-nigh\r\nomnipotent. Mr. Carnes has a certain low cunning which I can also use\r\nto advantage. Both of you will join me.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You might as well close your switch and save your breath, Saranoff,\r\nfor we will do nothing of the sort,\" replied the doctor sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but you will. So will Mr. Carnes. I had no hopes that you would\r\njoin me willingly. In fact, I am pleased that you do not. I could\r\nnever trust you. All the same, you will join my forces as have the\r\nothers whom I have brought into the hands of the Selom. I have ways of\r\naccomplishing my desires. It pleases my fancy, Doctor, to use your\r\nbrains in aiding me in my scientific developments. You will enjoy\r\nworking with the scientists of the Selom. Among them you will find\r\nbrains which excel any to be found on the surface of the earth, since\r\nwe two are below. Already I have learned much from them. You, Mr.\r\nCarnes shall be taught to pilot an airplane. When my cohorts go forth\r\nfrom the realms of the Selom to establish the rule of Russia, you will\r\nbe piloting one of the planes. Your first task will be to learn to\r\nfly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to do anything of the sort!\" said Carnes.\r\n\r\n\"I will not be ready to have your flying lessons started until\r\nto-morrow,\" replied the Russian, \"and you will have until then to\r\nreconsider your rash decision. It will be much easier for you if you\r\nobey my orders. If you still refuse to-morrow, you will pay a visit to\r\nthe laboratory of the Selom. When you return your lessons will be\r\nstarted. You will now be taken to your cell. I have use for Dr. Bird\r\nthis afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't leave Dr. Bird and that's flat!\" exclaimed Carnes. Dr. Bird\r\ninterrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead, Carnesy, old dear,\" he said lightly. \"You might just as\r\nwell toddle along under your own power as to be dragged along. You\r\nhave a day for reflection, in any event. I daresay I'll see you again\r\nbefore they do anything to you.\"\r\n\r\nCarnes glanced keenly at the doctor's face. What he saw evidently\r\nreassured him for he turned without a word and walked away. The light\r\ngrew gradually dimmer until darkness again reigned in the cavern.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Doctor,\" said Saranoff's voice. \"We have work to do.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCarnes sat alone in his cell for hours. The darkness and loneliness\r\nwore on him until he felt that his nerves would crack. Not a sound\r\ncame to him. He threw himself on one of the beds and plugged his ears\r\nwith his finger tips in an attempt to keep the silence out. Then a\r\ncheerful voice sounded in the cell and a friendly hand fell on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Carnesy, old dear,\" said Dr. Bird, \"have you been lonesome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Bird!\" gasped Carnes in tones of relief. \"Are you all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right as can be. I learned a lot this afternoon. For one thing,\r\nyou're going to start flying lessons to-morrow and you're going to do\r\nyour best to become an expert pilot in a short time. It is the only\r\nthing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And fly a plane for Saranoff?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not. The only way to avoid that very thing is to keep your\r\nmentality unimpaired so that I can call on you for help when I need\r\nit. If the Selom operate on you, you will be useless to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Operate? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you. The Selom are a very old and highly civilized people.\r\nFor ages they have possessed scientific knowledge for which the\r\nupper-world scientists are now blindly groping. Among other things,\r\nthey have a perfect knowledge of the workings of the brain. If they\r\noperate they will remove from your brain every speck of memory you\r\nhave of past events, leaving only those things that will be useful to\r\nSaranoff. You will be his complete slave. In that condition you will\r\nbe taught to fly a plane. When the time comes, you will fly one with\r\nno remembrance of anything which happened prior to the operation and\r\nwith no will but his. It will be easier to teach you flying in your\r\nnatural state if you are willing. You will be willing.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you wish it, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I do wish it, most decidedly,\" Dr. Bird went on. \"Obey every order\r\nthey give you. You will find that the Selom are an enlightened and\r\ncivilized race. They are very kindly and would willingly harm no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why have they taken up with Saranoff?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the first man with whom they have come into contact. He has\r\ntold them a horrible tale of conditions on the surface, and they have\r\nswallowed it, hook, line and sinker. They believe that he is going to\r\nestablish a new order of happiness and plenty for all with the aid of\r\nhis gang of cutthroats from Russia. If they had the slightest inkling\r\nof the true state of affairs, they would turn on him in an instant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember that I am a stranger here and he has poisoned their minds\r\nagainst me. Although the mind of an ordinary men is an open book to\r\nthem, they cannot read Saranoff's secret thoughts against his will.\r\nThey can't read mine either, for that matter. I am working in the\r\nlaboratory and I will pick up a great deal. When the time comes, we\r\nwill strike for our liberty and for the safety of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you learn Saranoff's plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He is gathering planes and pilots in the underground caverns of\r\nthe Selom. When he gets enough, he will bring men from Russia to man\r\nthe planes. What could the United States, or the world for that\r\nmatter, do against a fleet of hundreds, possibly thousands, of the\r\nbest planes equipped with deadly weapons unknown to their science?\r\nThat menace confronts us and we must remove it. To give you some idea\r\nof the power of the Selom, this afternoon Saranoff and I with one\r\nassistant opened a cavern in the solid rock three miles long and a\r\nmile wide and over six hundred feet in height.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three men! How on earth did you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two men and one mole. We did it with a ray, the secret of which only\r\nthe Selom and Saranoff know.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You have told me a disintegrating ray is an impossibility,\" objected\r\nCarnes.\r\n\r\n\"It is. This was not a disintegrating ray. Carnes, either I am crazy\r\nor the Selom have solved the secret of time, the fourth dimension. I\r\nhaven't been able to grasp the whole thing yet. What I think we did\r\nwas to remove that rock a distance, perhaps only a millionth of a\r\nsecond, forward or back into time. At any rate it ceased to exist, yet\r\nthey can bring it back unchanged at will. That was the way they\r\ncaptured our plane. They sent out a magnetic ray of such power that it\r\nstopped our plane in midair and brought it to the ground. They\r\nremoved the rock from beneath us and lowered us into the hole. By\r\nreversing the process they restored things to their original\r\ncondition. All of these tunnels and rooms were made in that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still don't understand how they did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't either, but I hope to in time. Now let's go to bed. It's\r\nlate. To-morrow you will start your lessons with Captain Garland as an\r\ninstructor. He won't know you for he was operated on this afternoon.\r\nDo your best to become a pilot. When I get ready, I want you with me\r\nin full possession of all your faculties.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning the two prisoners separated and went to their duties.\r\nIn the cavern which Dr. Bird had described, Captain Garland was\r\nwaiting beside the plane he had flown. He did not know Carnes, but he\r\nstill knew how to fly. Declining to enter into any conversation, he\r\nstarted expounding the theory of flying to the detective. Carnes\r\nremembered Dr. Bird's words and applied himself wholeheartedly. For\r\nfour hours they worked together. At the end of that time the light\r\nfaded in the cavern and Carnes was led by an unseen guide back to his\r\ncell. He threw himself on a bed and awaited Dr. Bird's return.\r\n\r\n\"I have learned a few more things about the Selom,\" said the doctor\r\nwhen he entered the cell several hours later. \"We are in their largest\r\ncommunity. They have cities or warrens scattered all over the world.\r\nEach city has its own ruler, but the whole race are ruled by an\r\noverlord or king who habitually lives here. He is away visiting a\r\ncommunity under northern Africa just now, but he will be back in a few\r\ndays. The Selom are sincere in their desire to help the upper world.\r\nThey feel great pity for mankind in view of the conditions Saranoff\r\nhas described to them. When the king returns. I plan to make a direct\r\nappeal to him. In the meantime, go on with your flying lessons. How\r\ndid you make out to-day?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second day was a repetition of the first, as were the third and\r\nfourth. A week passed before Dr. Bird entered the cell in evident\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Has Hanac brought our evening food yet?\" he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Take this light. As soon as he enters throw the light full on\r\nhim and hold him until I work on him. We've got to make our escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"The king is due back to-morrow. Saranoff is frightened at the good\r\nimpression I have made on the Selom. He is supreme in the monarch's\r\nabsence, so he plans to operate on both of us before he returns. He is\r\nafraid to allow me to see the king with an unimpaired intellect and\r\nmemory. Shh! Here comes Hanac.\" The door to their cell opened\r\nnoiselessly. When the mole who brought their food was well inside,\r\nCarnes turned on the tiny flashlight. The mole dropped on all fours\r\nand tried to turn its back. Dr. Bird sprang forward. For an instant\r\nhis slim muscular fingers worked on the mole's neck and shoulders.\r\nSilently the animal sank in a heap.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Carnes,\" cried the doctor. \"Turn off the light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you kill him, Doctor?\" asked Carnes as he raced down a pitch dark\r\ncorridor at the scientist's heels.\r\n\r\n\"No, I merely paralyzed him temporarily. He'll be all right in a day\r\nor so. Turn here.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes they ran down corridor after corridor. Carnes soon\r\nlost all track of direction, but Dr. Bird never hesitated. Presently\r\nhe slowed down to a walk.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good thing I have a good memory,\" he said. \"I planned that\r\ncourse out from a map, and I had to memorize every turn and distance\r\nof it. We are now behind your flying hall and away from any of the\r\nregular dwellings of the Selom. Straight west about four miles is one\r\nof the time-ray machines with a guard over it. Aside from them, there\r\nisn't a mole between here and Detroit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we going to do, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep out of their way and avoid recapture if we can. If we merely\r\nwanted to escape we would try to get possession of that time-ray\r\nmachine and open a road to the surface. However, I am not content with\r\nthat. I want to stay underground until Astok, their king, returns.\r\nWhen he comes, we will surrender to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they operate without giving us a chance to present our side\r\nof the affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they do, Saranoff wins; but they won't. The more I have seen of\r\nthe Selom, the more impressed I am by their sense of justice. They'll\r\ngive us a hearing, all right, and a fair one.\"\r\n\r\nFor two hours the doctor led the way. At the end of that time he\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\"We've gone as far as we need to,\" he said. \"They'll undoubtedly send\r\nout searching parties, but if we can avoid thinking they won't be able\r\nto find us. The tunnels are a perfect labyrinth. If you care to sleep,\r\ngo to it. We'll be safer sleeping than awake, for we won't be sending\r\nout thoughts so fast.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bird threw himself down on the rubber floor of the tunnel and was\r\nsoon asleep. Carnes tried to follow his example, but sleep would not\r\ncome to him. Frantically he tried to think of nothing. By an effort he\r\nwould sit for a few minutes with his mind a conscious blank, but\r\nthoughts would throng in in spite of him. Time and again he brought\r\nhimself up with a jerk and forced his mind to become a blank. The\r\nhours passed slowly. Carnes grew cramped from long immobility and\r\nrose. A sudden thought intruded itself into his mind. \"I might as well\r\nthrow that light away,\" he murmured to himself. \"It will be no good\r\nnow. The Selom won't hurt us if they do catch us.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached in his pocket for the light. He was about to hurl it from\r\nhim when a moment of sanity came to him. He stared about. The impulse\r\nto hurl the light away came stronger. He strove in vain to turn it on.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor!\" he cried suddenly. \"Wake up! They're after us!\"\r\n\r\nWith a bound, Dr. Bird was on his feet.\r\n\r\n\"The light!\" he cried. \"Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In--my--hand,\" murmured Carnes with stiffening lips.\r\n\r\nDr. Bird seized the light. A beam stabbed the darkness. Less than\r\nfifty feet from them stood two moles. As the light flashed on Carnes\r\nregained control of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Take the light, Carnes,\" snapped the doctor. \"I've got to put these\r\nfellows to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly he advanced toward the motionless Selom. He had almost reached\r\nthem when the light flickered out. He turned and raced at full speed\r\ntoward the detective. Carnes was standing rigid and motionless. Dr.\r\nBird took the light from his hand. Despite the almost overpowering\r\ndrag on his mind, he managed to turn it on. He swung the beam around\r\nin a circle. Besides the two Selom he had seen before, the light\r\nrevealed a pair standing behind him. As the light struck them, the\r\nnumbing influence vanished for an instant from the doctor's mind. He\r\nmoved a step forward and then halted. The moles behind him were\r\nhurling waves of mental power at him. Again the light cleared him for\r\nan instant, but he got a brief glance of other moles hurrying from\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\n\"The jig's up, I guess,\" he muttered. He strove to free himself by the\r\nuse of his light, but the tiny battery had done its duty, and\r\ngradually the light grew dimmer. The influence grew too strong for\r\nhim. With a sigh he shut off the feeble ray and hurled the light from\r\nhim. The moles closed in.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the doctor audibly. \"We'll go peaceably.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the paralyzing power was withdrawn. With Carnes at his\r\nside he retraced the route he had taken from the cell. Before they\r\nreached it they turned off. Dr. Bird realized that they were treading\r\nthe familiar path to the laboratory.\r\n\r\nOutside the laboratory the Selom halted. A wave of mental power\r\nenveloped the prisoners and they remained silent and motionless while\r\ntheir escort withdrew. From the laboratory came three of the Selom\r\nscientists. As the laboratory door opened they could see that it was\r\nbathed in a flood of light, and that the moles wore helmets covering\r\ntheir heads. They moved inside. Clad in a white gown stood Saranoff.\r\n\r\n\"So, my friends, you would run away and leave me, would you?\" gloated\r\nthe Russian. \"And just when I had planned a very beneficial operation\r\nfor you! I will remove permanently from your brains all the delusions\r\nwhich now encumber them, and for your own puny wills I will substitute\r\nmy own.\"\r\n\r\nThe power which had held the prisoners silent disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"You have caught us, Saranoff,\" said Dr. Bird. \"I know the power you\r\nwield and that you are making no idle boast. I appeal, however, to\r\nthese others, my friends. The operation you are planning to perform\r\nis not a routine one. It is one that should have the sanction of the\r\nking before it is done. I appeal from you to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is far away,\" laughed Saranoff. \"When he returns, your plea will\r\nbe presented to him, but it will be too late to do you any good. You\r\nare right, Doctor--I do not plan a mere routine operation. Not only\r\nwill I remove your memory, but I'm going to use the time-ray on you\r\nand banish forever into the unknown a portion of your brains. Without\r\nknowing which adjustment I make of the infinite number possible, no\r\none, not even the king, can ever recall it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Bird turned to the Selom scientists and hurled his thoughts at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"This man intends to commit a horrible crime,\" he thought, \"and one\r\nwhich he has no authority to perform. To you I appeal for justice. Bid\r\nhim wait until Astok returns, and let him be the judge as to whether\r\nit shall be done. Jumor, you know me well. You know that my brain is\r\nthe equal of one of the Selom. Even you cannot read my thoughts\r\nagainst my will. Are you willing to see that brain destroyed? Astok\r\nwill be here soon and nothing will be lost by a short delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"He thinks truly,\" was the answering thought of Jumor. \"It would be\r\nbetter to wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not wait,\" crashed Saranoff's thought into their\r\nconsciousness. \"He killed Hanac when he escaped, and his punishment\r\nshall be as I have decreed. Did not the king give me full power while\r\nhe was away?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true that he ordered us to obey this man in all things dealing\r\nwith upper-world men,\" thought Jumor. \"If it is true that he killed\r\nHanac his punishment is doubtless just.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not kill Hanac,\" returned the doctor. \"He is paralyzed and will\r\nbe all right in a few hours, if he isn't already. I demand that you\r\nwait until Astok returns. When an appeal is made to him, no other may\r\njudge. So says the Selom law.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" replied Jumor. \"We will wait until the king returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will _not_ wait,\" came Saranoff's thought. \"The king delegated to\r\nme his powers during his absence, as far as all the world, save the\r\nSelom, were concerned. Were it one of the Selom appealing to the king,\r\nI would be powerless before the appeal. These are not bound by Selom\r\nlaw and are not entitled to its benefits. We will operate at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will operate alone,\" retorted Jumor. \"I will not assist\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need none of your help,\" thought Saranoff. \"Asmo and Camol, will\r\nyou help me? If you refuse I will report to Astok that you have\r\ndisobeyed and defied his chosen delegate.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better assist him, Jumor,\" thought Asmo. \"Astok did delegate\r\nhis authority. I am not of the nobility and I dare not refuse to\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suit yourself, Asmo,\" replied Jumor. \"I refuse to assist, and will\r\nappeal to Astok against him.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third mole hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"You are higher in rank than we are, Jumor,\" he thought at length,\r\n\"and like Asmo, I dare not resist him. I heard the king give this\r\nupper-earth man his authority while he was away. I will assist.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I will leave the room,\" retorted Jumor.\r\n\r\nHe moved to a door and threw it open. At the threshold he paused and\r\nsent back a final thought.\r\n\r\n\"I will appeal to Astok, our ruler. I will send now a message to him\r\nto hurry home that he may judge between us.\"\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind him. Saranoff chuckled audibly.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Carnes,\" said Dr. Bird sadly. \"This devil can do all he says\r\nhe can, and more. I'm sorry I brought you and Garland into this mess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, it can't be helped, Doctor,\" replied the detective with an\r\nattempt at cheerfulness. \"What is he going to do to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll have to use instruments for what he plans,\" said the doctor.\r\n\"Ordinarily a routine mental operation is performed without the use of\r\nextraneous power. The mind of the operator is electrically connected\r\nto the mind of the victim. By means of thought waves the operator\r\nbanishes from the mind of the subject such portions of his memory and\r\nmentality as he chooses. He may then substitute other things in place\r\nof what he has removed. Any of the Selom could operate on you, but I\r\ndoubt whether Jumor himself could do it successfully on me without aid\r\nfrom power. Here come the instruments.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAsmo and Camol took from a cabinet on the side of the wall what looked\r\nlike a cloth helmet. Attached to it were a dozen wires which they\r\nconnected to a box on a table. The box was made of crystal and inside\r\nit could be seen a number of vacuum tubes and coils of various\r\ndesigns. Other leads ran to a similar helmet which Asmo placed on\r\nSaranoff's head. A heavy cable ran to a switch on the wall.\r\n\r\nAs Camol closed the switch the tubes in the box began to glow with\r\nweird lights. Violet, green and orange streamers of light came from\r\nthem to dance in wild patterns on the laboratory walls. For five\r\nminutes Saranoff made adjustments to dials on the front of the crystal\r\nbox. The colored lights died away and a gentle golden glow came from\r\nthe apparatus. He threw off the helmet.\r\n\r\nCamol left the laboratory and returned with a large coil on the top\r\nof which was mounted a parabolic reflector. A device like a clock on\r\nthe front of the coil was constantly marking the passage of time. The\r\ndial had two indicators which were together. Saranoff chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"You may not have seen this device work, Doctor,\" he said. \"In order\r\nto let you know what you are facing, I will demonstrate.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned the reflector so that it bore on the wall. He adjusted the\r\nmoving dial so that the two indicators were no longer together. As he\r\nclosed a switch, the wall before the reflector vanished. Saranoff\r\nturned off the power.\r\n\r\n\"That portion of the wall has gone back in time exactly three\r\nseconds,\" he announced. \"As far as the present is concerned, it has\r\nceased to exist. It is following us through time three seconds behind\r\nus, but in all eternity it will never catch up unless I aid it. Since\r\nthe exact time is known, it can be restored. If I were to alter this\r\nadjustment ever so little, it could never be recalled. Watch me.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe again closed the switch, this time in a reverse direction. The wall\r\ninstantly filled up as it had been before. He moved the time dial so\r\nthat the two indicators coincided.\r\n\r\n\"After I have sent a portion of your physical brain into the past or\r\nthe future as the fancy strikes me, I will change the adjustment of\r\nthat dial. Since there are an infinite number of adjustments to which\r\nI might have set it, the chances that any one could ever duplicate my\r\nsetting and restore it are the complement of infinity, or zero,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I am now ready to remove your memory. If the impossible should\r\nhappen and your physical brain be restored it would be useless. Asmo,\r\nadjust the helmet. I will operate on my friend, the Doctor, first.\"\r\n\r\nCarnes strove to rush to Dr. Bird's assistance, but he was helpless\r\nbefore the force of Camol's will. Asmo adjusted the helmet to Dr.\r\nBird's head and buckled it firmly in place. With an evil grin,\r\nSaranoff donned the other helmet.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Dr. Bird,\" he said mockingly. \"You will continue to see me,\r\nbut you won't know me, except as your master.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis hand reached for the switch. It had almost closed on it when\r\nSaranoff stopped convulsively. He sat motionless while the laboratory\r\ndoor opened and Jumor entered the room. He was followed by another\r\nmole. The newcomer was fully six inches taller than the others. His\r\nhead was hidden by a helmet, but around his arms he wore strings of\r\nsparkling jewels.\r\n\r\n\"Ivan Saranoff, what means this?\" his powerful thoughts dominated the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"I was merely engaged in rectifying some of the mental errors of this\r\nman of the upper earth,\" explained the Russian eagerly. \"It is merely\r\na routine operation such as you gave me authority to perform.\"\r\n\r\n\"An operation which uses power is not routine,\" replied the king. \"I\r\nam told that this upper-earth man has a brain equal to those of my\r\nmost advanced scientist. I am also told that you planned to do more\r\nthan rectify his mental errors.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been falsely informed. I was merely about to adjust his\r\nmemory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what means this?\" The king pointed to the time-ray machine.\r\n\r\n\"That was brought here in order that it could be used when you\r\nreturned,\" thought the Russian eagerly. \"This upper-earth man killed\r\nHanac when he brought him food.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Hanac entered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Astok,\" objected Hanac's thoughts, \"when these upper-earth men\r\nhad me at their mercy, with a light, they spared me. They paralyzed me\r\nfor a time so that they might escape but they did it in such a manner\r\nthat no harm came to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"So Jumor told me,\" replied the king. \"Release them.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn an instant Carnes was on his feet removing the helmet from Dr.\r\nBird's head. The doctor struggled to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Bird,\" thought the king, \"can you communicate with me easily?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Your Majesty, but may I ask that you alter the vibration period\r\nof my comrade, Mr. Carnes? He cannot understand you with his present\r\nlow period.\"\r\n\r\nThe king stepped to the box with which Saranoff had been working. In\r\nresponse to his commands the helmet which had been on Dr. Bird's head\r\nwas placed on the detective. The king made a few adjustments to the\r\ndials and signalled for the helmet to be removed.\r\n\r\n\"Can you understand me, Mr. Carnes?\" he asked mentally.\r\n\r\nThe question leaped with startling clearness into the detective's\r\nhead. Carefully he framed his answer.\r\n\r\n\"I can understand you,\" said the king. \"I will now sit in judgment on\r\nthe appeal made to me. Dr. Bird tell me your story.\"\r\n\r\nWith eloquent thoughts, Dr. Bird poured forth the history of the upper\r\nworld. He told of the great war and the collapse of the Russian\r\nmonarchy. He traced history to the fall of the moderate party and the\r\nrise of the Bolsheviki. He described the horrible conditions existing\r\nin Russia. At the end he reviewed the long battle he and Carnes had\r\nfought against Saranoff. When he had finished, the king questioned\r\nCarnes.\r\n\r\nThe detective repeated the story in different words and the king\r\nturned to Saranoff. From the Russian's mind came a tissue of distorted\r\nfacts and downright lies. He denied or twisted around everything that\r\nthe detective and the scientist had said. When he had done with his\r\ntale, Astok sat in secret thought for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"The tales you tell me are so far apart that I can give credence to\r\nnone of them,\" he announced at length. \"There is but one solution.\r\nAlthough they are never used, for the Selom have forgotten the meaning\r\nof a falsehood, we have instruments which will drag the truth from the\r\nbrain of a liar. They are powerful and their use may easily be fatal.\r\nIf a man gives forth the contents of his brain willingly, the process\r\nis not painful. If he tries to conceal anything, it is torture. Will\r\nyou willingly submit your brains to the searching of this instrument?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gladly,\" came Dr. Bird's thought and Carnes reechoed it.\r\n\r\n\"And you, Ivan Saranoff?\" demanded the king.\r\n\r\n\"I will not submit,\" thought the Russian sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"You will be examined whether you submit willingly or not,\" replied\r\nAstok. \"I am going to learn the truth though I kill you all to get\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the king's order, Jumor hastened from the laboratory. He returned\r\nin a few minutes with an apparatus similar to the one which Saranoff\r\nhad planned to use on Dr. Bird, but larger, and with more dials on the\r\ncrystal box. At a command from the king, Dr. Bird donned the helmet.\r\n\r\nThe king manipulated switches and dials. Around Dr. Bird's head glowed\r\na halo of crimson light. Twice an expression of momentary pain passed\r\nover his countenance. After half an hour, Astok cut on the power and\r\nnodded to Carnes.\r\n\r\n\"Don't try to hold anything back, Carnesy,\" said Dr. Bird sharply.\r\n\"You couldn't if you tried, and the process is very painful, I can\r\nassure you.\"\r\n\r\nWith the helmet on his head the detective sat for ten minutes while\r\nthe Selom king went through his brain. A dozen times he shrieked in\r\nagony but his moments of suffering were short. The king removed the\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\n\"Your minds agree well,\" he thought. \"Now I will examine the mind of\r\nmy friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe helmet was strapped on Saranoff. Instantly an expression of the\r\nutmost anguish crossed his face. Shriek after shriek of agony came\r\nfrom his writhing lips. Relentlessly the king applied more power. The\r\ncries of the Russian grew heartrending. Suddenly he grew rigid and\r\nslumped forward in his chair. Astok impassively manipulated his\r\ninstrument. After half an hour, he opened the switch and removed the\r\nhelmet. Under the ministrations of Jumor the Russian revived. The king\r\nsat in secret thought for an hour.\r\n\r\n\"I have examined the brains of all of you,\" he announced at length,\r\n\"and I find hopeless contradictions. Each of you believes thoroughly\r\nin his own social order. Both tell me of hopeless misery on the part\r\nof a large portion of his people. Both tell of horrible wars and\r\nsuffering beyond my comprehension. The thoughts of all of you teem\r\nwith modes of bringing death to your fellow beings. Your entire\r\nscience his been perverted to the ends of destruction. Nothing of the\r\nsort can be realized by the Selom where truth, justice and mercy\r\nprevail. Each of you holds that his form of government is better than\r\nthe other, and will cause less suffering and misery than the others'.\r\nNone of you hold out hope of happiness for your fellow beings. I do\r\nnot know which system is less obnoxious. My decision is made. The\r\nSelom will not interfere in the affairs of the upper-earth. You may\r\nfight out your battles without aid and without interference.\r\n\r\n\"I will operate on both Ivan Saranoff and Dr. Bird. I will remove from\r\ntheir minds all knowledge of our science and instruments and leave\r\nthem in the same condition that they were when they entered my realms.\r\nEach of you will then be returned to upper-earth, Ivan Saranoff to\r\nRussia, Dr. Bird and Mr. Carnes to the United States. The pilots, whom\r\nI hold prisoners, will have their mentalities restored and be returned\r\nto their homes. The planes we have captured, I will send off into time\r\nso that they can never be used for the misery of upper-earth men\r\nagain. Jumor, you will carry out these orders.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could remember how that time machine was built and\r\noperated,\" said Dr. Bird reflectively, as he sat in his private\r\nlaboratory in the Bureau of Standards some time later, \"but Jumor did\r\nhis work well. I can't even remember what the thing looked like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Doctor, our trip below wasn't a loss. We removed a very real\r\nmenace to the established order of things and we have got rid of\r\nSaranoff temporarily. It will take him some time to return here from\r\nRussia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks or less,\" said Dr. Bird pessimistically. \"However, we\r\nhave gained one other thing. Did you notice this?\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled what looked like a watch from his pocket. Carnes regarded it\r\nwith a puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n\"No, Doctor, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a very small camera which takes pictures one-half inch by\r\nseven-eighths. I had several opportunities to use it. I wasn't sure\r\nthat it would work on such short waves, but it did. When Saranoff\r\ntries to return to this country, he will find that every immigration\r\ninspector and every member of the border patrol has an excellent\r\nlikeness of him. That may hinder his entrance into the country for a\r\nlittle while.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA CLASSIFICATION OF THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\nA classification of everything in the universe, from the smallest\r\nthing yet measured, the electron, less than a millionth of a millionth\r\nof an inch in extent, to the biggest, a star system of a thousand\r\nmillion trillion miles, was described recently by Prof. Harlow Shapley\r\nof Harvard in a lecture at the commerce center of the College of the\r\nCity of New York.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to a time when man will be able to measure even\r\nsmaller things than the electron and larger than the greatest star\r\nsystem, Prof. Shapley explained that he had left the classification\r\n\"open at both ends.\"\r\n\r\nMan, Prof. Shapley said, occupies a very small place in all this\r\nsystem, although, beside an electron or an atom, he is not so\r\nnegligible, at that.\r\n\r\n\"The survey,\" it was explained, \"aims toward giving perspective. It\r\ngives a sane and modest view of man's place in the scheme.\r\n\r\n\"The significance of the classification lies in the skeleton which is\r\nafforded all science to bring some measure of order out of the world's\r\npresent chaotic knowledge of the systems of various kinds.\r\n\r\n\"All systems find a place in this synthesis--atoms, comets and\r\ngalaxies; man, radiation and the space-time complex. When looked at in\r\nthis objective way, human beings, and all associated terrestrial\r\norganisms, appear only parenthetically in one of the subdivisions of\r\nthe class of colloidal aggregates.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Shapley discussed the concept of the cosmoplasma.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" it was explained, \"is at once the most mysterious and\r\nfundamental part of the universe, and only recently has come under\r\ndirect experimental study. In brief, it is the substratum of materials\r\nthroughout the universe, between planets, stars and the galaxies.\r\n\r\n\"It has no obvious systematic organization. Hence it includes such\r\ndiverse constituents as the high speed shooting stars, interstellar\r\ncalcium gas and radiation itself.\r\n\r\n\"Though no one has even seen an electron, the smallest thing included\r\nin the classification, they have been proved to exist in several ways.\r\nThey give forth flashes of light that can be photographed. They have\r\ncaused the bending of X-rays as they pass through a substance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Readers' Corner\r\n\r\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Likes the \"Corner\"_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     This month's issue, May, has the best collection of letters\r\n     you've ever published. All it lacked was a letter from\r\n     Bernard J. Kenton, that master of epistles and super-science\r\n     stories. One of your Readers would like to have \"The\r\n     Readers' Corner\" omitted. For heaven's sake, don't take it\r\n     out! I recognize it as one of the best features of our mag,\r\n     and whenever I open the covers, turn to it directly after\r\n     having glimpsed the table of contents and the announcement\r\n     of the stories to appear in the forthcoming issue.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Joseph R. Barnes--whose letter I enjoyed immensely,\r\n     incidentally--will be interested in knowing that \"The Mascot\r\n     Deep\" is already in book form and that \"The Disintegration\r\n     Machine\" and \"When the World Screamed,\" all by the same\r\n     author, are under the same covers. He also will be\r\n     interested in learning that Ray Cummings' fine story, \"Sea\r\n     Girl,\" is also between hard covers.\r\n\r\n     The idea of putting out a quarterly is a dandy. The other\r\n     science fiction quarterlies are mere text-books; there are,\r\n     occasionally, of course, a few exceptions. The thought of\r\n     the sort of fantastic action stories Astounding Stories\r\n     publishes, put together in a magazine doubly thick, is a\r\n     pleasing one to contemplate. Reading a story the length of\r\n     \"Brigands of the Moon\" and of such literary merit, complete\r\n     in one issue, is a thrill to be looked forward to. By all\r\n     means put out such a magazine and have stories by Jack\r\n     Williamson, R. F. Starzl and Edmond Hamilton, three of your\r\n     best writers, in the first issue.\r\n\r\n     I'm glad to see that Starzl is coming back with the next\r\n     issue. More from him, please. And Hamilton and Williamson\r\n     should appear more frequently, too.\r\n\r\n     A question, Mr. Cummings: Shades of Polter and Tugh!--why\r\n     must you always have a deformed character in your stories?\r\n     Do they appeal to your dramatic sense?\r\n\r\n     The news that we're going to have a story from Francis Flagg\r\n     brings raptures of delight to my homely face. If it's a\r\n     dimensional story, I'll cheer twice. When it comes to\r\n     writing that kind of a story, Flagg's the king of them all.\r\n     For sheer interest and originality, he's got his\r\n     contemporaries in that field outdistanced with a distance\r\n     that can only be counted by light-years.\r\n\r\n     A pat on the back for Booth Cody and Sears Langwell, two\r\n     staunch supporters.\r\n\r\n     All our magazine needs is a story about time crusaders, or a\r\n     planet of mechanical men.\r\n\r\n     Omitting the authors already mentioned, I considered my\r\n     favorites to be Rousseau, Eshbach, Diffin, Ernst, and Hal K.\r\n     Wells.\r\n\r\n     The best story you ever published? Who am I to answer? Why\r\n     not put it up to the Readers for popular vote?--Jerome\r\n     Siegel, 10522 Kimberley Ave., Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation Wanted_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     This is my first letter to you, but I am a consistent Reader\r\n     of Astounding Stories, and look forward to all of the coming\r\n     issues. I have in mind a question, a friendly one, not one\r\n     that I expect to or hope will seem to be trying to dampen\r\n     any theories. This rocket-ship propulsion: as I understand\r\n     it, there is a void between all planets, etc. If this is the\r\n     case, how then can a rocket-propelled space ship go across\r\n     this void? Since the exhaust of the rockets must rely on\r\n     some material of a sort, or rather some sort of resistance\r\n     to push the ship along, how does it push on nothing? Of\r\n     course, near Earth it has the ground and then the atmosphere\r\n     to push from, but out in the void, why not cut off and save\r\n     fuel, therefore saving an extra heavy load of explosives, if\r\n     rocket-ships were really practical in space flying? Yours\r\n     for a thicker Astounding Stories--H. M. Crowson, Jr.,\r\n     Sumter, S. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Better Than Love Stories_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have started to read the Astounding Stories and enjoy it\r\n     very much, although I do not find very many girls writing in\r\n     to the \"Corner.\" This mag is a thousand times better than\r\n     all those love story magazines, and besides these stories\r\n     are educational.\r\n\r\n     I would rather read Astounding Stories than eat. They are\r\n     not too scientific to be boresome, but they are just good\r\n     enough to be real interesting.\r\n\r\n     I wish you would publish some more stories like \"The Lake of\r\n     Light,\" \"Dark Moon,\" etc. I especially like stories of the\r\n     future and interplanetary novels.\r\n\r\n     Anyone wishing to correspond with me will be welcome, as I\r\n     love to write letters, and especially to anyone interested\r\n     in the same things that I am.--(Miss) Bernice Goldberg, 147\r\n     Crescent Drive, Mason City, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kidding the Editor_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have just finished your January, 1932, issue of Astounding\r\n     Stories. It was superb.\r\n\r\n     Imagine my delight and surprise when I purchased the first\r\n     issue this year! Smooth edges! Good quality of paper! I had\r\n     a few other articles to purchase but I forgot all about\r\n     them when I saw your magazine and rushed home to read it.\r\n\r\n     It had a most admirable cover design by your best artist, H.\r\n     W. Wesso. I turned to the Contents Page. The first story was\r\n     by my favorite author, Ray Cummings, and called \"The Space\r\n     Car to Mars.\" Hot dog! My favorite theme, interplanetary\r\n     travel.\r\n\r\n     All the rest of the Authors were my favorites too! Edmond\r\n     Hamilton, Capt. S. P. Meek, S. P. Wright, A. J. Burks and a\r\n     short story by Jack Williamson.\r\n\r\n     I turned to the next page and lo and behold, what do I see\r\n     but an editorial. Wonders after wonders! It was called \"The\r\n     Possibilities of Space Travel.\" I was by this time beginning\r\n     to think that at last the Editor had achieved a perfect\r\n     magazine, and when I turned to the first story, the one by\r\n     Ray Cummings, I knew it. There was a double-page\r\n     illustration by Wesso in soft and realistic _colors_! Think\r\n     of it! _Colored_ illustrations for each story!\r\n\r\n     Well, I was so excited that I could hardly read, but at last\r\n     I began. Boy, can Ray Cummings write interplanetary stories!\r\n     Y como! (And how!) He wove scientific explanations into the\r\n     story so very skillfully that one learned the scientific\r\n     facts without knowing it. When he thought that the\r\n     explanation of some invention would be boresome, he put a\r\n     little note at the foot of the page. This, I remembered, was\r\n     an admirable feature in his story \"Brigands of the Moon,\"\r\n     which you published two years ago.\r\n\r\n     I then turned to \"The Readers' Corner\" only to discover that\r\n     its name had been changed to \"The Observatory.\" (I expect\r\n     this name was taken from the suggestion of P. Leadbeater in\r\n     the March, 1931, issue.) I discovered also, to my delight,\r\n     that at the end of each letter the Editor made a few\r\n     comments. I finished reading the Readers' letters and on the\r\n     next page I found this leadline: \"Science Questions and\r\n     Answers.\" I read these with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n     I forgot to mention the raise in the price to twenty-five\r\n     cents, but that is immaterial to me now since I have the\r\n     perfect science fiction magazine. You have surely hitched\r\n     your wagon (magazine) to a star now!--Clay Ferguson, Jr.,\r\n     510 Park St. S. W., Roanoke, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sugar Candy_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     It is very seldom that I write to any page like \"The\r\n     Readers' Corner\" but I have gotten rather tired of all those\r\n     knocks. So I am writing to say that I have missed only one\r\n     of your issues since the second, (Feb. 1930) and have found\r\n     only one not to my liking, and I have forgotten what that\r\n     is.\r\n\r\n     I have no comment to make on your Authors. I don't care who\r\n     writes it or what his literary reputation is--as long as\r\n     the story is good; and you wouldn't print it if it weren't.\r\n\r\n     As for exact scientific data--away with it. Some may wish to\r\n     be bored with it, but I prefer action. I like your pictures.\r\n     They are bizarre and give one an idea of what the Author is\r\n     trying to convey. And they intrigue the interest before the\r\n     story is read. I also like the size, because it is not\r\n     awkward, and I like the edges because they make the pages\r\n     easy to turn.--Mrs. Margaret M. Phinney, 1632 W. 3rd,\r\n     Plainfield, N. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Becoming a Habit_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     The May Astounding Stories seems to have nothing but\r\n     complimentary letters in it. Mr. Magnuson probably tore out\r\n     his hair when he saw all those letters. Not that Astounding\r\n     Stories fully deserves all that praise. As one Reader said,\r\n     words are inadequate to describe how wonderful your magazine\r\n     is; however, I do not agree with those who denounce some of\r\n     the Readers for making criticisms and suggestions. No\r\n     magazine can be absolutely perfect, although Astounding\r\n     Stories comes pretty near it. Even if it were perfect, the\r\n     Readers would have to keep on making criticisms and\r\n     suggestions in order to keep it that way. Besides, \"The\r\n     Readers' Corner\" would become pretty dull and lifeless if\r\n     you printed nothing but flattering letters. Most of the\r\n     Readers who make unfavorable criticisms really have the\r\n     welfare of the magazine in mind, else they wouldn't write at\r\n     all. All of them aren't grouches. For example: a certain\r\n     person sent one of the Science Fiction magazines about the\r\n     most vicious and uncomplimentary letter that magazine had\r\n     ever received. Yet in this issue of Astounding Stories he\r\n     jumps on the knockers for daring to say anything against\r\n     Astounding Stories! So you see that all knockers are not\r\n     hopeless!\r\n\r\n     I notice that you have complied with one of my requests, and\r\n     have published an autobiography of Mr. Wentzler, although\r\n     there is no picture. Perhaps, as Mr. Wentzler suggests, that\r\n     is for the best. The readers of Astounding Stories are\r\n     accustomed to pictures of grotesque and weird-looking\r\n     inhabitants of other planets, but a picture of Mr. Wentzler\r\n     may prove to be too much. Or, if you do put it in, you might\r\n     entitle it \"Wesso's Conception of a Martian.\"\r\n\r\n     I hope Mr. Wentzler does not take the above paragraph too\r\n     seriously. Like him, I was hit on the head when I was but a\r\n     babe. In my case, it was a bronze statue that proved to be\r\n     my undoing. Unfortunately, they were never able to\r\n     straighten out the bend in that statue, which was the result\r\n     of its contact with my dome.\r\n\r\n     As for the stories in the May issue, they were all perfect,\r\n     every one of them. Having all the stories perfect in each\r\n     issue is becoming a habit with you. Keep up this habit. For\r\n     first place I nominate \"When the Moon Turned Green.\" I\r\n     considered Mr. Wells' previous story, \"The Gate to Xoran\"\r\n     the best short story you had ever printed, but the later one\r\n     surpasses it. You will not be making a mistake if you give\r\n     us many more stories by this Author. I do not need to say\r\n     anything else about the rest of the stories--they are all\r\n     excellent.\r\n\r\n     Don't you think that it is about time for Astounding Stories\r\n     to become a semi-monthly?--Michael Fogaris, 157 Fourth\r\n     Street, Passaic, N. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Located at Last_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I read every Science Fiction magazine on the market, and can\r\n     truthfully say that yours is the best of them all.\r\n\r\n     Of course, there is always room for improvement, and some of\r\n     the stories published in the May issue were not so hot. Meek\r\n     always gives me a pain in the neck, but Cummings is an ace,\r\n     though the installment in this issue dragged considerably.\r\n     In Diffin you have a master writer; and I was tickled to\r\n     death to see finally in \"our\" mag a story by that peerless\r\n     team, Schachner and Zagat.\r\n\r\n     I was wondering how long it would take you to locate them,\r\n     as you have done with most of the other stars in Science\r\n     Fiction.--Bill Merriam, Ocean Front, Venice, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Stories Aid Considerably\"_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I cannot rightfully say what story was the best in\r\n     Astounding Stories. For the man who balances stories for\r\n     their values is just kidding himself. That is my theory and\r\n     I am ready at all times to stand in back of it.\r\n\r\n     Though I have only been reading Astounding Stories since\r\n     January, I am a thoroughly convinced fan. For the past two\r\n     years I have been puttering with chemistry and physics in a\r\n     laboratory of my own, and the science mentioned in these\r\n     stories aids considerably.\r\n\r\n     I would sincerely appreciate letters from Readers of\r\n     Astounding Stories. I will answer all.--Lawrence Schumaker,\r\n     1020 Sharon St., Jamesville, Wis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Rescue, Somebody!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     You're getting better all the time. The April number was the\r\n     best yet, and the May issue is not far behind it. The cover\r\n     on the May issue was wonderful.\r\n\r\n     \"Dark Moon\" is the best story by Diffin that you have yet\r\n     printed. \"When the Moon Turned Green\" and \"The Death Cloud\"\r\n     are both masterpieces.\r\n\r\n     \"The Exile of Time\" is a fine story, but I cannot understand\r\n     the explanations. How could the murder of Major Atwood be\r\n     mentioned in the records of New York? Why could not one see\r\n     events in which he participated? Of course, Ray Cummings\r\n     perhaps knows more about it than I, but I think a lot of his\r\n     ideas are the bunk.\r\n\r\n     I do not think that your stories should be full of science\r\n     and nothing else, but they should at least observe known\r\n     scientific facts.--J. J. Johnston, Mowbray, Man., Can.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A \"Two-Timer\"_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I was surprised but pleased to receive the answer to the\r\n     question I asked in my letter to you. It is indeed a\r\n     pleasure to read a magazine that takes enough interest in\r\n     its patrons to personally answer a letter written to it.\r\n     Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n     And I am certainly glad that we are to get a sequel to \"Dark\r\n     Moon.\" I wish that I could personally tell Mr. Diffin what I\r\n     think of his writing.\r\n\r\n     I am anxiously awaiting the next issue of \"our mag.\" It\r\n     certainly does seem a long time between issues. When are you\r\n     going to start putting it on the stands twice a month? I\r\n     know that thousands of Readers would bless the day you did\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     Please keep up the good work; and I know you will, for the\r\n     longer I read A. S. the more I enjoy it.\r\n\r\n     The serial, \"The Exile of Time,\" is a story par excellence.\r\n     But I know the forthcoming sequel to \"Dark Moon\" will be a\r\n     super-story.\r\n\r\n     My idea of reading is that if a story is worth reading once\r\n     it is worth reading twice, and I have never seen any story\r\n     in your book that was not worth reading once. Nuff said.\r\n\r\n     I will answer any letters written me. I hope to hear from\r\n     plenty of Readers--C. G. Davis, 531 S. Millard, Chicago,\r\n     Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_And Sequel It Has_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have just finished the May number of Astounding Stories,\r\n     and want to send my contribution to \"The Readers' Corner.\"\r\n\r\n     The novelette, \"Dark Moon,\" by Diffin, is rather an\r\n     outstanding story, in my opinion. It is plausible and\r\n     convincing, and the literary quality is high. I have a\r\n     feeling that this should have a sequel, and wonder if others\r\n     will not agree with me. That Astounding Stories is the best\r\n     of the Science Fiction Magazines is something that scarcely\r\n     lends itself to argument. Without questions, it leads them\r\n     all. Take the present number for instance: Diffin, Meek and\r\n     Cummings, three top-notchers, all in one issue.--A. J.\r\n     Harris, 1525 Bushnell Ave., South Pasadena, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I'm Afraid Not_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have read every one of your Astounding Stories and think\r\n     there is no other magazine on the market like it. Only one\r\n     kick: it doesn't appear often enough. I should like to see\r\n     it every week; every two weeks, anyway. I like every story\r\n     you print, and I think the size of your magazine is perfect.\r\n     I have saved every issue I read, and now have seventeen of\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     \"Phalanxes of Atlans\" and \"Marooned Under the Sea\" were\r\n     especially good. \"The Readers' Corner\" is fine, but I don't\r\n     like so many brickbats thrown. I should like to see more\r\n     bouquets given to you.\r\n\r\n     There is one thing I'd like to see you print. You probably\r\n     have heard of the Fox Movietone picture, \"Just Imagine,\" an\r\n     interplanetary story of 1930. I'd like to see it printed in\r\n     Astounding Stories more than anything else. It would make a\r\n     fine serial. I don't suppose it would be possible for you to\r\n     print it, though, would it?--Ernestine Small, 1151 Brighton\r\n     Ave., Portland, Ore.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Better to Verse_\r\n\r\nDear Editor:\r\n\r\n    Astounding Stories can't be beat;\r\n    Its every issue is a treat.\r\n    The finest authors of the age\r\n    Appear upon Astounding's stage.\r\n    There's Diffin, Cummings, Leinster, Burks;\r\n    An all-star cast that's sure the works.\r\n    Harl Vincent, Wells, and Starzl, too,\r\n    Belong among this famous crew.\r\n    Ed Hamilton and Vic Rousseau\r\n    With Captain Meek complete the show.\r\n    Together they are sure the best;\r\n    That's why Astounding leads the rest!\r\n\r\n                         --Booth Cody, Bronx, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Another \"Two-Timer\"_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have just finished reading the May issue of Astounding\r\n     Stories for the second time. I have been reading Astounding\r\n     Stories for over a year, and so far I can find only one\r\n     thing wrong with it, and that is that it is not thick\r\n     enough. In other words, you do not put enough stories in it.\r\n\r\n     Some people who write in to the \"Corner\" say that the paper\r\n     is rotten. I still have all my magazines, and the paper is\r\n     as good as new. The paper is also good on the eyes, as it\r\n     does not reflect light like a mirror, as some paper does.\r\n     Some people say the pages are uneven and hard to turn. Like\r\n     Mr. H. N. Snager, I become so interested in the stories I do\r\n     not notice such trifles. Anybody who yells about the color\r\n     of the cover, the durability of the paper, is not very\r\n     interested in Astounding Stories.\r\n\r\n     Why don't you either print a full page picture at the\r\n     beginning of each story or else keep the half page picture\r\n     at the beginning and put another picture halfway through the\r\n     story?--Wm. McCalvy, 1244 Beech St., St. Paul, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Buttercup for Paul_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Congratulations! Astounding Stories has scored again! Not\r\n     satisfied with illustrations by the mighty Wesso only, you\r\n     have secured a drawing by the equally mighty Paul! May we\r\n     see many more by him?--Thomas L. Kratzer, 3595 Tullamore\r\n     Rd., Cleveland Heights, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nerves Now Better?_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     In Gould you have a fine illustrator; in Wesso a better one,\r\n     but as I skip the page on which the story, a truly\r\n     remarkable one by R. F. Starzl, \"The Earthman's Burden\" is\r\n     on, my eye is caught by--yes! a drawing by Paul, good old\r\n     reliable Mr. Paul, the king of Science Fiction illustrators.\r\n     Now that you have him on your artist's staff I wouldn't feel\r\n     at all bad seeing a painting of his on the cover.\r\n\r\n     The June issue was a dazzler. \"Manape the Mighty\" held me\r\n     spellbound. The others were all excellent stories. The cover\r\n     painting by Wesso was good, but I have already seen one of\r\n     that sort in a previous issue. Why not give us more\r\n     interplanetary illustrations of space ships and the like as\r\n     in \"Brigands of the Moon\"?\r\n\r\n     Another thing, it is nine-thirty. I must be asleep by\r\n     eleven-thirty in order to start for school early the next\r\n     morning. I allow myself two hours in which to read\r\n     Astounding Stories. I turn to the contents section; I see a\r\n     story there which I wish to read. It is on page 604. I turn\r\n     the pages: 599, 601, 607 come in rapid succession, all but\r\n     the page I look for. This goes on for some time until at\r\n     last the roughened edge of 604 comes into view. By then my\r\n     nerves are on edge and I find it is almost eleven-thirty!\r\n\r\n     But I cannot say that you do not stand up with the foremost\r\n     of all magazines, and the way you are improving now you'll\r\n     soon forge far in front.--Arthur Berkowitz, 763 Beck St.,\r\n     New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Goal!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Permit me to congratulate Mr. Diffin on his latest\r\n     masterpiece, \"Holocaust.\"\r\n\r\n     Every once in a while Mr. Diffin produces a story that bids\r\n     fair to eclipse all its contemporaries. His former story,\r\n     \"The Power and the Glory,\" could also be placed in that\r\n     category. Somehow, that story has become indelibly written\r\n     on my memory. The philosophy expressed in it was\r\n     overwhelming. It would have done justice to a Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n     And now, you can imagine how delighted I am to learn that\r\n     Mr. Diffin has once again graced us with a yarn of the same\r\n     class.\r\n\r\n     Man, if you continue to publish such stories as these\r\n     frequently, you'll have the public terming Astounding\r\n     Stories literature of the highest grade! However, I won't\r\n     entreat Mr. Diffin to write these stories spasmodically, as\r\n     the long wait between tales adds lure to the stories.\r\n\r\n     And now for Mr. Burks. Ah--here is an extraordinary chap!\r\n     Mr. Burks is your most versatile author. Of his several\r\n     stories, each has opened up a new vista in the field of\r\n     Science Fiction, and he is a thoroughbred in each endeavor.\r\n     If you want to be convinced, read the opening chapters of\r\n     \"Manape The Mighty,\" and I will wager any sum you won't lay\r\n     down the story until you've read every word.\r\n\r\n     As a matter of fact, all the stories are good. And the bill\r\n     for next month appears to be exceptionally unusual. It is\r\n     very evident that you are on the road to perfection. Smooth\r\n     cut edges, the acquisition of the greatest of artists, Paul,\r\n     all point to the accelerating progress Astounding Stories is\r\n     achieving.\r\n\r\n     We Readers are frequently asked as to how we would run the\r\n     magazine if we were Editors. Well, here is my conception of\r\n     the ideal magazine:\r\n\r\n     Smooth paper, no advertisements whatsoever, the interior\r\n     illustrations done by an artist with the talent of a Paul\r\n     and a Wesso combined, and made in water colors, too. Then I\r\n     would only have such renowned Authors as Burroughs, MacIsaac\r\n     and a few others. I suppose that's the eternal dream of the\r\n     modern Editor, but who can say that you, Mr. Bates, won't\r\n     evolve Astounding Stories in the same manner. At any rate,\r\n     there's a goal to aim for.--Mortimer Weisinger, 266 Van\r\n     Cortlandt Ave., Bronx, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Guilty_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     You are hereby summoned to appear in Court on attempt of\r\n     murder. Following are the charges: Stopping my heart from\r\n     beating when I saw the smooth edges in Astounding Stories,\r\n     and making my heart miss five beats when I saw \"The\r\n     Earthman's Burden\" illustrated by Paul!\r\n\r\n     I now think Astounding Stories has reached its highest peak.\r\n     Arthur J. Burks' story was a wow. I hope he works on a story\r\n     as he said he would in \"The Readers' Corner\" if he gets\r\n     enough requests.\r\n\r\n     And Charles Willard Diffin! Here's a writer for you. I think\r\n     the first story he ever wrote was published in Astounding\r\n     Stories. Don't lose him. His \"Holocaust\" is his best, with\r\n     the probable exception of \"The Power and the Glory.\" I don't\r\n     think the last mentioned ever got enough praise. I expect to\r\n     see it reprinted some day in The Golden Book Magazine. It's\r\n     distinctly smooth paper style.\r\n\r\n     And of course Sewell Peaslee Wright's \"John Hanson\" stories\r\n     are top-notchers.\r\n\r\n     And Ray Cummings. Must we mention his story? We all know\r\n     what to expect when we read one of his stories. I hope you\r\n     have another serial by him soon.\r\n\r\n     I'm sure you'll be deluged with letters because of the even\r\n     edges and the illustrations by Paul (who should draw at\r\n     least two in every issue), but I hope you'll print my\r\n     letter, because I never had a letter of mine in print, and\r\n     want to get a thrill seeing this published.--Anthony\r\n     Caserta, 4575 Park Ave., New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Very Pretty Problems Here_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     The letters by P. Schuyler, J. N. Mosleh, and Jackson Gee in\r\n     the last number sure do raise some very neat possibilities\r\n     in Science. Anent travel in time, just what would you, Mr.\r\n     Schuyler, expect to see if \"John Doe\" at 40 years (1931)\r\n     went back to 1892 and met \"John Doe\" of that date on Main\r\n     Street of his old home town? I suspect that two bodies\r\n     cannot simultaneously contain the same ego, constant-entity,\r\n     personality, or soul.\r\n\r\n     Which brings me to Mr. Mosleh, to ask: Just how is the\r\n     self-realizant ego, which is conscious that \"I am I\"\r\n     unchangingly for life, in any sense a derivative of the\r\n     unstable, rapidly changing body?\r\n\r\n     Mr. Burks and Mr. Lee elucidate a very pretty little problem\r\n     on the same lines. The cranial transplantation and the\r\n     \"atomic patterns\" are admittedly scientifically and\r\n     reasonably possible. But there is a real point of doubt:\r\n     Would the personality accompany the brain in\r\n     transplantation? True, the brain is the control room; but--?\r\n\r\n     And would the \"atomic patterns,\" perfectly as they could\r\n     duplicate a body, which is unstable by nature, work on the\r\n     essentially stable ego (relatively) with its inherent\r\n     capacity for continuity?\r\n\r\n     If not, would not the synthetic \"Extra Man\" be a human being\r\n     minus personality? Some very pretty problems here. I'd much\r\n     like to see a story along the lines of item 3 in Mr. Burks'\r\n     letter.--L. Partridge, Box 84, Cornish, Me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What Price Smoothness?_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have just finished the June issue of Astounding Stories.\r\n     The cover was excellent, as were all the illustrations,\r\n     except perhaps Manape's arms should have been a little\r\n     larger.\r\n\r\n     I see that the edges of the paper are now smooth, but still\r\n     the leaves stick out beyond one another, so what good does\r\n     that do?\r\n\r\n     \"Manape the Mighty,\" by Arthur J. Burks, was superb,\r\n     gripping. I suppose a lot of Readers will rise violently\r\n     against the love interest, but, I ask you, just where would\r\n     this particular story be without the romance in it? This\r\n     particular story, you understand; not every story.\r\n\r\n     \"Holocaust,\" by Charles Willard Diffin, was next best with\r\n     \"The Man from 2071\" a close second.\r\n\r\n     \"The Earthman's Burden\" was at least entertaining, which\r\n     this installment of \"The Exile of Time\" was not.--Robert\r\n     Baldwin, 359 Hazel Ave., Highland Park, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time Trouble Answers Wanted_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have read your magazine for nearly two years, but this is\r\n     my first letter to the \"Corner.\" The first and second\r\n     installments of Ray Cummings' \"Exile of Time\" prompted me to\r\n     write this. There is a story you can well be proud of. I\r\n     should like to obtain it in book form. Mr. Cummings is a\r\n     wonder. I have read many time stories, but his is at the top\r\n     of my list.\r\n\r\n     If there is any other \"time\" fan in A. S.'s \"Readers'\r\n     Corner\" I should like to have a letter discussion on it with\r\n     him. None of my acquaintances care a whoop about that type\r\n     of story, so I have to thrash out all my problems by myself.\r\n\r\n     There are some questions I would like to ask about \"The\r\n     Exile of Time.\"\r\n\r\n     1--In the event of the appearance of the time-traveling\r\n     cage, the story ran, to use Ray's own words: \"Suddenly\r\n     before me there was a white ghost. A shape. A wraith of\r\n     something which a moment before had not been there. The\r\n     shape was like a mist. Then in a second or two it was\r\n     solid.\"\r\n\r\n     Why should the cage appear as a mist at first? If there is\r\n     any amount of time separating two things, those two things\r\n     are invisible to each other, are they not? Any amount of\r\n     time would include a second, and even a millionth part of a\r\n     second. In that case, the cage should suddenly appear in the\r\n     twinkling of an eye, with no trace of a blur.\r\n\r\n     2--Supposing I were standing at a spot five feet from a\r\n     time-traveling vehicle. The latter would be traveling\r\n     through time at 3 P. M., while I am at 2 P. M.--an hour's\r\n     difference between us. It would be invisible to me then, but\r\n     an hour later when I would be at 3 P. M. and the machine at\r\n     4 P. M., then I would see it as it appeared at 3 P. M.\r\n     Whatever movement it would make in space, I would not see\r\n     until an hour later. Is that right? Then is it not possible\r\n     that each individual is existing in a different time realm?\r\n     And we see them, or I see the other fellow as he appeared\r\n     when my time caught up with his? I had better quit before I\r\n     get hooted off the stage.\r\n\r\n     3--If a man invented a time-traveler and went back to the\r\n     year of the beginning of the World War, knowing all he has\r\n     read in history, could he not take steps to prevent a war\r\n     that has already happened? Or would that power be denied\r\n     him? Somewhere in the story is said that the past cannot be\r\n     changed, and that any effort to do so would be useless. In\r\n     my belief, no matter where or when a man goes into the past,\r\n     if he appears in a year or day that has already gone by, he\r\n     is changing the past. Then there should be no room for\r\n     doubt: time-travelling is impossible. It never will be done\r\n     (An Astounding Stories fan should be kicked for using the\r\n     word \"impossible\"!).\r\n\r\n     Let's have more good thought-provoking time tales. And get\r\n     lots of stories from Cummings--he's a wow. I sure would like\r\n     to spend an evening at a campfire with him.--Allen Spoolman,\r\n     613--4th Avenue, W., Ashland, Wisc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Eh, What?_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Just got my June issue of our good mag, Astounding Stories,\r\n     and I think that it is great. One thing you should do,\r\n     however, is have a more mechanical cover design.\r\n\r\n     In regard to Miss Gertrude Hemkin's letter in the June issue\r\n     of A. S., let me say that I just wonder what she would like\r\n     to expect in our \"The Readers' Corner\" if she does not like\r\n     to hear what others think of our Astounding Stories. Maybe\r\n     she would like to read about checker debates or the like.\r\n     Eh, what?\r\n\r\n     If Rex Wertz of Oregon, who is now located somewhere in Los\r\n     Angeles, will drop me a line, perhaps we can become\r\n     acquainted as he suggested.--Edward Anderson, 123 Hollister\r\n     Ave., Ocean Park, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hope He Does_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have never been interested before in a magazine enough to\r\n     write to their departments, like \"The Readers' Corner,\" and\r\n     I have read plenty of magazines.\r\n\r\n     \"Beyond the Vanishing Point\" stands head and shoulders above\r\n     any story I have ever read. I have only one thing to say\r\n     about your other stories: they are almost as good as the one\r\n     I just mentioned.\r\n\r\n     I have a few words to say about these people who throw\r\n     brickbats at every story they read. I wouldn't be surprised\r\n     if they just read the story so they could find something\r\n     wrong with it. There's one in particular who wrote a few\r\n     lines in the June issue about your taking the word \"science\"\r\n     off the front page, saying there was no science in the\r\n     magazine, anyway. What does the title say? Well that's what\r\n     90% of the Readers want, anyway. I hope that chap reads\r\n     this.\r\n\r\n     Well, I'll sign off. Here is a little toast to the magazine:\r\n     \"Long may it live.\"--Earl Rogers, 409--16th St., Galveston,\r\n     Tex.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Two, Better Than One?_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     The two outstanding stories in the May issue of A. S. were\r\n     \"The Death Cloud,\" by Nat Schachner and Arthur L. Zagat, and\r\n     \"Dark Moon,\" by Charles W. Diffin. Common reasoning tells me\r\n     that the heads of two Science Fiction writers can formulate\r\n     a story better than one. I couldn't help admire Mr.\r\n     Schachner and Mr. Zagat when I read their story because of\r\n     the cleverness shown in it.\r\n\r\n     Please give us a story by them every month.--Ray Y. Tilford,\r\n     Rockport, Ky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_And Here I Am_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     It's about time for me to concede that your or \"our\"\r\n     magazine is the best I have read. Ten issues have come into\r\n     my hands and I am perfectly well satisfied with the line of\r\n     fiction that you publish. I have read about fifty different\r\n     magazines on the market, and I am sure that Astounding\r\n     Stories is the best of them all. I have followed the\r\n     magazine for seven months and that is the best amount of\r\n     reading any magazine can boast for me. In your case, if the\r\n     magazine lasts seventy years, you can be sure that I will\r\n     read it for that period of time (provided I live that long).\r\n\r\n     I notice that several brickbats have come into your hands\r\n     and that you have printed them. Well, that shows\r\n     sportsmanship on your part. I would suggest to those who are\r\n     not satisfied with Astounding Stories to duck their head in\r\n     a pail of water and pull it out after a period of ten\r\n     minutes. Those who criticize the stories because of the lack\r\n     of science have no idea what it takes to write a story.\r\n     Please be willing to concede the Author the right of way. He\r\n     is giving his theories and not yours. However, in some cases\r\n     where the truth is an established fact, I can see where the\r\n     Readers may present a justified argument. But they should\r\n     remember that we are not all perfect and that mistakes are\r\n     made by all. It is not fair to criticize an Author by\r\n     denouncing him.\r\n\r\n     I don't favor reprints at all, but I can stay with the\r\n     majority if they do. It is a foregone conclusion that you\r\n     can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't\r\n     fool all of the people all the time. In this case substitute\r\n     the word \"please\" in the saying for \"fool.\"\r\n\r\n     I am at present reading Charles W. Diffin's novel \"The\r\n     Pirate Planet.\" It is one of the best interplanetary novels\r\n     that I have ever read. Give us some more of Diffin; he has\r\n     the goods. I must say that you have an immensely long list\r\n     of popular authors, and it must cost quite a little amount\r\n     of money to maintain them.\r\n\r\n     Keep the size of the magazine as it is now; it fits\r\n     conveniently into my bookcase, and I believe many of your\r\n     Readers will say the same.\r\n\r\n     Now some of my favorite stories. \"The Ape-Men Of Xlotli\" was\r\n     one of the best stories that I have read in years. Give us\r\n     some more along this line. It offers rest after one has just\r\n     finished reading an interplanetary novel.\r\n\r\n     \"Monsters of Moyen\" was another story that I greatly\r\n     enjoyed. Very few people believe that the world shall ever\r\n     have a conqueror again, and I am one of them; but it is\r\n     interesting to see if there ever will be a conqueror and\r\n     what means he shall employ to get that title.\r\n\r\n     \"Brigands of the Moon\" was the worst story I read in your\r\n     magazine. That must have been Mr. Cummings' off story. But\r\n     he certainly has come back fine through his later stories.\r\n\r\n     \"The Tentacles from Below\" was another great masterpiece.\r\n     Anthony Gilmore's tale was the first that I have read of\r\n     that author, and I will be delighted to see more.\r\n\r\n     Funny how I developed into a Reader of Science Fiction. I\r\n     exhausted all other fields of reading, and having nothing\r\n     else to read I delved into a science magazine and here I\r\n     am.--Michael Racano, 51 Brookwood St., East Orange, N. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turns to It First_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     The June issue of Astounding Stories can't be beat. What an\r\n     issue! As it seems to be the usual thing, I'll start at the\r\n     front and go to the back.\r\n\r\n     The cover: very colorful: another proof of Wesso's talent.\r\n     And speaking of artists, I was very pleasantly surprised at\r\n     the unexpected illustration by Paul. I certainly hope you\r\n     can get him, if not for cover pictures, at least for the\r\n     inside illustrations. (Too bad you are modest about printing\r\n     complimentary letters, for I mean this to be all roses, no\r\n     brickbats.)\r\n\r\n     \"The Man from 2071\"--another good story of \"John Hanson's.\"\r\n     \"Manape the Mighty,\" although somewhat like the Tarzan\r\n     series, is a wonderfully fine story. \"Holocaust\"--good. \"The\r\n     Earthman's Burden,\" as all of Starzl's, was exceptionally\r\n     good. \"The Exile of Time\"--getting better every issue.\r\n\r\n     \"The Readers' Corner\" as usual was one of the most\r\n     interesting parts of the magazine. I always turn to it\r\n     first, for I know I will have an enjoyable time reading\r\n     every letter. And, by the way, the significance of \"Manape\"\r\n     just came to me. Don't know why I didn't see it\r\n     before.--Linus Hogenmiller, 502 N. Washington St.,\r\n     Farmington, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Likes the \"Joke\"_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Although I have read only two issues of Astounding Stories,\r\n     I feel the urge to write a line. The June number was better\r\n     than the May issue. Arthur J. Burks' story, \"Manape the\r\n     Mighty,\" was excellent, though I am not so strong for the\r\n     idea of having Barter escape the apes and carry on his\r\n     experiments as suggested by the Author. It would be against\r\n     common sense to have the apes allow him to make a getaway.\r\n     The prize winner in the May issue was \"Dark Moon.\" There\r\n     might be a sequel to that, and I'd like to see it.\r\n\r\n     I like a little variety in a magazine. The Readers who say\r\n     they do not care for stories scientifically impossible may\r\n     be right; in that case \"The Exile of Time\" is the greatest\r\n     joke ever written--yet I like it immensely. One thing that\r\n     is impossible is the destruction of matter. It can be broken\r\n     up, or condensed as in \"When Caverns Yawned,\" but not\r\n     destroyed completely.\r\n\r\n     Mr. W. H. Flowers evidently has a grudge against the fair\r\n     sex. The love interest is not necessary in short stories,\r\n     it's true; but what kind of a long novel would it be if the\r\n     hero had no incentive, nothing to risk his life for, except\r\n     a possible word of praise from the scientific world?\r\n\r\n     No matter how much a man loves his work it is my opinion\r\n     that he would not die for the purpose of proving his point.\r\n\r\n     Not being able to take a hint, the knockers still appear to\r\n     mar an otherwise perfect day--this time in the person of\r\n     Harry Pancoast. If Astounding Stories ever gets so bad that\r\n     not even one story in it is of interest to me--I'll just\r\n     drop out of the waiting line--and keep my mouth\r\n     closed.--Richard Waite, 8 South Ave., Warsaw, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Never Noticed That_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Just bought my latest copy of Astounding Stories, and what\r\n     an edition! First, the cover (Wesso has all others beat by a\r\n     mile). Then, the stories. Well, take \"Manape the Mighty\": it\r\n     is one of the best Science Fiction stories I have ever read.\r\n     \"The Exile of Time\" was great.\r\n\r\n     Have you ever noticed that almost every critic of Science\r\n     Fiction is either a teacher or a female? Jim Nicholson and I\r\n     certainly know that.--Billy Roche, Sec. Interplanetary Dept.\r\n     of the B. S. B., 101 St. Elmo, San Francisco, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunflowers for All_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Miracles do happen! I was never so thoroughly astounded in\r\n     all my life as when I received the great June issue of \"our\"\r\n     magazine with _straight_ edges! Thank you and all concerned\r\n     for publishing \"our\" magazine sans rough edges. The smooth\r\n     edges ought to cut the reading time of Astounding Stories\r\n     down to an hour and forty-five minutes as we always used to\r\n     waste a lot of time fumbling about with the pages.\r\n\r\n     But if I was astounded at the long awaited straight edges, I\r\n     was still more amazed at the great innovation of an\r\n     illustration by Paul! Let's have more and more of his\r\n     remarkable drawings. Astounding Stories is truly great now\r\n     with its fine Editor, splendid Authors, excellent stories,\r\n     worthy illustrations, essential \"Readers' Corner,\" Paul\r\n     (Ah!) and good binding! Yes! You heard right! I said good\r\n     binding! Of course it makes amusing material to write about\r\n     the binding and remark that it comes off after once handling\r\n     it, or that the paper is soon worn to shreds, but such\r\n     matters shouldn't be honestly believed. I have every issue\r\n     of Astounding Stories (eighteen great numbers!) and each and\r\n     every issue is as good as new. I have never had any trouble\r\n     with the covers departing from the rest of the magazine or\r\n     the pages becoming moldy.\r\n\r\n     Sewell Peaslee Wright's \"The Man from 2071\" is just perfect.\r\n     I enjoy nothing more than one of his realistic stories of\r\n     Commander John Hanson. We want more! Arthur J. Burks'\r\n     novelette, \"Manape the Mighty,\" was clever. I had a\r\n     premonition that I wouldn't like this story, and in fact\r\n     told a friend so. It just goes to prove that hunches can be\r\n     wrong. Charles Willard Diffin should be proud of his\r\n     \"Holocaust.\" I'm sure that most Readers enjoyed it as much\r\n     as I did. Of course, Starzl's \"The Earthman's Burden\" was a\r\n     peach. His stories of other planets are always weird,\r\n     bizarre, and yet they seem to ring true. That is the magic\r\n     of R. F. Starzl! Paul illustrated it in his own\r\n     unapproachable style. \"The Exile of Time,\" as everyone\r\n     agrees, is Cummings' best. I am waiting for its thrilling\r\n     conclusion.\r\n\r\n     I am one who would like Astounding Stories to be a large\r\n     size magazine, but it can easily be seen that everyone can't\r\n     be pleased. If you'll just leave it the way it is--i. e.,\r\n     straight edges, illustrations by Paul, same authors and same\r\n     excellent Editor--I'll be satisfied.--Forrest J. Ackerman,\r\n     530 Staples Ave., San Francisco, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Great Relief_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     The story, \"Manape the Mighty,\" by Arthur J. Burks, was by\r\n     far one of the most thrilling and educational stories that\r\n     ever appeared in Astounding Stories. Of course, others will\r\n     disagree, but an Author cannot please all. It is of great\r\n     relief to change from the monotonous every day kind of\r\n     stories that appear in Collier's, Liberty and The Saturday\r\n     Evening Post to the refreshing and soothing \"impossible\"\r\n     type of A. S.\r\n\r\n     Ever since the January issue, I've been an ardent pursuer of\r\n     Astounding Stories. To me it is even more astounding that I\r\n     seem to like it more and more each succeeding issue. I find\r\n     it, undoubtedly, the best magazine of its type. I've tried\r\n     others of similar type, but it seems as if my mind couldn't\r\n     grasp the knack of their stories, which were either boresome\r\n     with scientific and technical explanations, or, as one might\r\n     say, \"not a darn thing to them.\"\r\n\r\n     R. F. Starzl is a wonderful author. Ray Cummings, Sewell\r\n     Peaslee Wright, Charles Willard Diffin, Captain S. P. Meek,\r\n     Edmond Hamilton, F. V. W. Mason and Murray Leinster are\r\n     excellent.\r\n\r\n     There is one thing that I'd like to see in Astounding\r\n     Stories, and I'm sure many of the Readers would, too. It is\r\n     always my habit to read while eating. To finish the story in\r\n     time, I pick the shortest one. Sad to say, Astounding has\r\n     rather long stories. How about an occasional short story?\r\n     I'm sure your readers will approve. They would go over with\r\n     a bang!--P. Nikolaioff, 4325 S. Seeley Ave., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sometimes Gets Mad_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Although I have been an interested reader of Astounding\r\n     Stories since its inception, this is the first time I have\r\n     written. Astounding Stories have been so good lately that I\r\n     just had to write and compliment you on your good work.\r\n     There are, however, some criticisms I have to make. The\r\n     first is: I think Mr. W. H. Flowers of Pittsburgh, Pa, is\r\n     right when he says you sometimes have too much love in some\r\n     of your stories. The second is, I think it would be a good\r\n     thing to put notes at the end of a page to explain some of\r\n     the terms for the Readers who read mostly for the science\r\n     part. That is what I do, and I get mad when I read something\r\n     that does not give me the inside dope on it. Outside of that\r\n     I think Astounding Stories can't be beat.\r\n\r\n     One more thing before I close. Keep Capt. S. P. Meek on your\r\n     staff or I will stop reading Astounding Stories, as much as\r\n     I would hate to do that. I think he is your best author by a\r\n     long shot.--Wilson Adams, Seat Pleasant, Md.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a \"Female Woman\"_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     The comment of Jim Nicholson in the June issue that it is\r\n     only \"the females\" who consider him \"cracked\" for reading\r\n     Science Fiction, and only women who do not care for science\r\n     in the stories, moves me to break into \"The Readers' Corner\"\r\n     for the first time.\r\n\r\n     I happen to be a \"female woman,\" and it is the men in our\r\n     family and circle of friends who laugh at me for buying\r\n     every Science Fiction magazine and book that I can find.\r\n     They call them my \"nutty magazines.\" I have to admit that I\r\n     do not understand much of the scientific explanation, since\r\n     my mind does not run along mathematical or scientific lines,\r\n     but I do not mind having that in stories, for those who do\r\n     care for it and can understand it, as I can simply skip over\r\n     it, taking what I can grasp and letting the rest go. It\r\n     doesn't spoil the story for me.\r\n\r\n     I have no criticism, constructive or otherwise, to make. I\r\n     enjoy the stories with some romance involved, and enjoy\r\n     those without equally well. My own preference would be that\r\n     you continue using rough paper and your present mechanical\r\n     construction, so that more money will be available to pay\r\n     for the stories. Few of us keep the magazines anyway, so\r\n     there isn't so much need for expensive paper. I like\r\n     interplanetary stories best, I think; but I was intensely\r\n     interested in \"Beyond the Vanishing Point,\" \"Manape the\r\n     Mighty\" and \"Holocaust.\" All different, but all very good. I\r\n     can't remember one I did not like.\r\n\r\n     My work requires much study and concentration. I have\r\n     recommended to several men who do similar mental work that\r\n     they follow my plan of securing delightful relaxation by\r\n     losing themselves in another world through Science Fiction\r\n     magazines. Most of them find it as restful as I\r\n     do.--Berenice M. Harrison, Angola, Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Likes R. F. Starzl_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     It has been my purpose to write to you before, but due to an\r\n     extraordinary amount of detail work which I have had to do,\r\n     I have been unable to.\r\n\r\n     I have read your marvelous magazine ever since the first\r\n     issue came into my hands, and I can honestly say that there\r\n     is no other book on the market which has held my attention\r\n     as long as yours has. I congratulate you on your very\r\n     interesting magazine.\r\n\r\n     Arthur J. Burks, in his latest story, has conceived an\r\n     entirely new type of story, and I, for one, think it very\r\n     interesting. Plenty of science for the laymen and enough\r\n     interest for the others.\r\n\r\n     I liked R. F. Starzl's story, \"The Earthman's Burden,\" very\r\n     much, and I hope you will have more by this author soon. His\r\n     stories are perfect. Starzl is a deep thinker, and I am\r\n     right here to say that there is a man who understands men\r\n     and men's longings and inhibitions.--A. W. Gowing, 17\r\n     Pasadena St., Springfield, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\r\n\r\nAll readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\r\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\r\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\r\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\r\n\r\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\r\nis a department primarily for Readers, and we want you to make full\r\nuse of it. Likes, dislikes, criticisms, explanations, roses,\r\nbrickbats, suggestions--everything's welcome here; so \"come over in\r\n'The Readers' Corner'\" and discuss it with all of us!\r\n\r\n                                                 _The Editor._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIVING, DISEMBODIED HEART\r\n\r\n\r\nA disembodied heart, not only still steadily beating but writing, as\r\nit throbbed, a permanent, minutely precise record of its pulsations,\r\nwas exhibited recently at Princeton in a demonstration of the newest\r\ninstrument developed by science for the advancement of medicine and\r\npsychology.\r\n\r\nThe device, invented by A. L. Loomis of Tuxedo Park, N. Y., and\r\nperfected in collaboration with Dr. Edmund N. Harvey, professor of\r\npsychology at Princeton University, is called the Loomis chronograph.\r\n\r\nIt will facilitate study of the phenomena of heart action and the\r\neffect of drugs on that vital organ. The chronograph opens the way to\r\nthe accurate measuring and recording of the speed and variation of\r\nhuman heart beats over long periods, even during the sleeping hours of\r\nthe subject, which is expected to prove of great value to\r\nphysiologists and criminologists.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the recent demonstration was that of a turtle, removed\r\nfrom the reptile while alive, freed of all extraneous tissue and\r\nsuspended in a physiological salt solution exactly duplicating body\r\nconditions. In this state the organ continues to beat for thirty-six\r\nhours, at the same time setting down, by means of the chronograph, a\r\ngraphic history of the approximately 72,000 pulsations it makes in\r\nthat time. With each beat the tiny organism pulled down a little lever\r\nthat dipped a fine filament into a drop of mercury and made a contact\r\nthat transmitted an electric impulse to the chronograph. There it was\r\ntranslated to a fraction of a second into a record inked on a chart.\r\n\r\nIntroduction into the solution of nicotine--one part in 10,000--and of\r\nadrenalin--one part in a billion--was immediately noted by a marked\r\nretarding of the heart tempo in the first case and swift acceleration\r\nin the second.\r\n\r\nUse of the chronograph to study the action of any heart that can be\r\nremoved from the living body is possible, the scientist said, adding\r\nthat a comparatively simple adjustment will make possible recording of\r\nthe human heart by a device applied to the chest.\r\n\r\nApplication of the instrument to tests of human nerve reactions and to\r\npsychological tests is forecast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Astounding Stories,  August, 1931, by Various",
