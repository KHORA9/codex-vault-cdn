First, he calls it ‘The hard covering of anything; the\r\nexternal crust.’ Second, ‘The covering of a testaceous or crustaceous\r\nanimal.’ And here we may stop, for this is just the signification\r\nwhich has to do with our subject; so let us turn the sentence inside\r\nout, and see what we can make of it. We all know what a covering is—an\r\nouter coat, a case, a protection from injury, a husk, a crust, a—in\r\nshort, a shell,—_scyll_ or _scell_, as our Saxon forefathers called it;\r\n_schale_, as the Germans now term it. No Latin nor Greek here, but the\r\ngood old Saxon tongue, somewhat rough and rugged, perhaps, but stout\r\nand sturdy, and honest and serviceable; a kind of language to stand\r\nwear and tear, like a pair of hob-nailed shoes, with little polish, but\r\nuseful, yes, very useful! Well, we have got so far, now comes a hard\r\nword—TES-TA-CE-OUS, what can it mean? It is pronounced _tes-ta-shus_,\r\ncomes from the Latin _testaceus_—having a Shell, and means consisting of,\r\nor composed of shells; so we find that a _testacean_ is a shell-fish,\r\nand _testaceology_ is the science of shells. Johnson’s second meaning of\r\nthe word _testaceous_ is ‘Having continuous, not jointed shells, opposed\r\nto crustaceous.’ So we find that some naturalists call those testaceous\r\nfish, “whose strong and thick shells are entire and of a piece, because\r\nthose which are joined, as the lobsters, are crustaceous.”\r\n\r\nNow some of the true testacean have shells in more than one or two\r\npieces, and therefore this last explanation of the term is rather\r\ncalculated to mislead a learner; but we shall explain presently wherein\r\nthe difference consists between them, and the CRUS-TA-CE-OUS, or, as\r\nwe pronounce it, _krus-ta-shus_, fish consists. Here is another long\r\nword, it comes from the Latin _crusta_, a word of many meanings, all\r\nhaving reference to an outer coat or covering. My readers know all about\r\npie-crust, and have perhaps heard a surly, snappish, peevish person\r\ncalled a crusty fellow; they will now understand what is meant by a\r\n_crustacean_ and _crustaceology_, that part of Zoology which treats\r\nof crustaceous animals. They constitute quite a large family, these\r\n_ologies_, and have a strange way of twisting themselves about, and\r\nexchanging limbs and features, so that one is puzzled at times to tell\r\nwhich is which. But here we have fixed two of them, called TESTACEOLOGY\r\nand CRUSTACEOLOGY, twin brothers, and very much alike in their\r\ncharacteristics. Let us have a good look at them, so that we may know\r\nthem again if we should lose sight of them for awhile. Now we will spell\r\nover the name of the first—\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nWhy, it is changed already? Has this science of shells then another name?\r\nYes, and this is it, pronounced _kong-kol-o-gy_, and derived from the\r\nLatin _concha_, which means properly a shell-fish with two shells, joined\r\nby a hinge, as the oyster, the cockle, etc. This present volume then is\r\na work on _Conchology_, the subject of it is _Conchiferous_, and whoever\r\nstudies it will be doing something towards becoming a _Conchologist_.\r\n\r\nSo much for names and titles; but still we have the question to answer,\r\nWhat are shells? In a learned work called a Cyclopædia, we find it\r\nstated that “shell is the hard calcareous (that is chalky) substance\r\nwhich protects, either partially or entirely, the testaceous mollusks\r\nexternally, or supports certain of them internally.” All this you will\r\nunderstand, except perhaps the word ‘mollusks;’ this is a term applied\r\nto soft-bodied animals, such as shell-fish, snails, etc., about which we\r\nshall have more to say as we proceed. By this we learn that _all_ shells\r\nare not external or outer coverings, some are internal or inner supports\r\nfor the soft, jelly-like bodies to which they belong, thus performing\r\nthe duty of bones. An example of this is seen in the shell of the Cuttle\r\nFish, called by naturalists _Sepia_, a description of which will be found\r\nfurther on in the book.\r\n\r\nShells are either _Crystalline_ or _Granular_. Now look at those two\r\nwords, they almost explain their own meaning. Crystalline shells are\r\nthose which have more or less of clearness, transparency as we say, so\r\nthat if held against the light it shews through them; they are sometimes\r\ncalled _Porcellaneous_ shells, from their resemblance in this respect to\r\nporcelain, or chinaware; the Common Cowry, (_Cypræa Tigris_,) is a shell\r\nof this description.\r\n\r\n_Granular_, or, as they are sometimes called, _Concretionary_ shells,\r\nare the most hard and compact; it is in these that the substance called\r\n_nacre_, or _mother-of-pearl_, is mostly found. One of the commonest\r\nexamples is the oyster shell; if broken across it will be seen to consist\r\nof very thin plates, or _laminæ_, as they are termed, closely packed\r\ntogether. The thinner these laminæ may be the more lustrous and beautiful\r\nappears the lining of the shell; that shifting play of colours which we\r\ncall _iridescent_, from iris—the rainbow, is then brightest and most\r\nnoticeable. A very remarkable substance is this mother-of-pearl; smooth,\r\nand shining, and delicately-tinted. Who would expect to find such a\r\nbeautiful lining to the rugged, rough, dingy-looking oyster, or mussel\r\nshell? Truly these mollusks, some of them, live in gorgeous palaces. And\r\nthe most curious part of the matter is that from the fluids or juices, of\r\ntheir own bodies, and from the chalky matter collected from the water,\r\nthey are enabled to secrete or deposit such wonderfully-constructed\r\nhabitations, which after all are little more than chalk. Burn a heap\r\nof oyster shells, or any other testaceous coverings, and you get\r\nlime the same as that produced by burning the white lumps from the\r\nchalk-pit, which lumps, by the way, are said to be composed wholly, or\r\nfor the most part, of marine shells. This we should call _cretaceous_\r\nmatter, from _creta_, which is the Latin for chalk, or _calcerous_,\r\nfrom _calcis_—lime. Granular shells you have been told are sometimes\r\ncalled _concretionary_, this is because they contain a large amount of\r\nthis chalky deposit. The rock called limestone, geologists tell us, is\r\ncomposed entirely of fossil shells and mud, or what was once mud, dried\r\nand hardened, most likely by extreme heat, to the consistence of rock.\r\nWonderful this to think of; huge mountains, and mighty masses, and\r\nfar-stretching strata, forming a large portion of the crust of the earth,\r\nmade up chiefly of the coverings of fishes, a great portion of them so\r\nsmall as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye.—Truly wonderful! But\r\nwe shall have more to say upon this head when we come to speak of Fossil\r\nShells, as well as on the subject of Pearls, in our chapter on the fish\r\nin whose shells they are chiefly found.\r\n\r\nIt has been a matter of dispute with naturalists whether the testaceous\r\nmollusks have shells at all before they issue from the egg, and the main\r\nevidence favours the opinion that, generally speaking, they do possess\r\nwhat may be considered as a kind of pattern or model of the habitation\r\nwhich they are to build. This appears to be of a pale horn-colour, and\r\ndestitute of any markings; but as soon as the animal enters upon an\r\nindependent state of existence, it begins to assume its distinctive shape\r\nand colour, gradually increasing with the growth of its living tenant,\r\nand becoming more and more decidedly marked, until it attains its full\r\nperfection of testacean development. Thus the age of some shell-fish can\r\nbe at once determined by the peculiar conformation and markings of the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe relative portions of animal and earthy, or rather chalky matter,\r\nwhich compose these shells, varies considerably in different kinds; in\r\nthose called Crystalline or Porcellaneous, the animal deposit is much\r\nless than in the granular or concretionary shells, where it not only\r\nconstitutes a large part of the whole substance, but is more dense,\r\nthat is thick, and also has the appearance of being membraneous, or\r\norganized matter. We can perhaps best explain this by saying that whereas\r\nthe different chalky layers of the crystalline shell seem merely glued\r\ntogether by the intervening animal fluid; those of the granular shell, as\r\nthe oyster, appear to be connected by interlacing membranes. But all this\r\nmy readers will learn more about from more advanced and scientific works\r\nif they proceed, as I trust they will do, in the study of CONCHOLOGY, a\r\nscience which has in a greater or less degree attracted the attention\r\nof curious and contemplative minds in all ages, and the study of which\r\nit has been well said is peculiarly adapted to recreate the senses,\r\nand insensibly to lead us to the contemplation of the glory of God in\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTY AND VALUE OF SHELLS.\r\n\r\nIn shells, as in all the works of the Almighty Creator, we may observe\r\nan infinite variety of form, and if they do not all strike us as alike\r\ngraceful, yet in each, however plain and simple, there is some peculiar\r\nbeauty, whether it be the mere hollow cup, or the simple tube, the smooth\r\nor twisted cone, the slender spire, the convoluted oval, or half circle,\r\nribbed or spiked, with a lip curving out like the leaf of a water lily,\r\nor a narrow rim, like that of a golden chalice; they are indeed elegant,\r\neach perfect of its kind, and bearing the impress of a constructive skill\r\nfar above that of man, who copies from them some of the most graceful and\r\nelegant designs wherewith to ornament his buildings, and shapes in which\r\nto fashion his articles of luxury or utility.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful scroll-work of marble chimney-pieces, cornices of\r\nrooms, and other enriched portions of both public and private structures,\r\nare those in which the forms of shells have been taken for the patterns\r\nof the artistic designs; and how tasteful and appropriate is the\r\nemployment of the shells themselves as ornaments for the mantle-piece,\r\nside-board, and chiffonniere. Then too,\r\n\r\n            “The rainbow-tinted shell, which lies\r\n    Miles deep at bottom of the sea, hath all\r\n    Colours of skies, and flowers, and gems, and plants.”\r\n\r\nNot only has it grace and elegance of form, but it has also richness,\r\nand delicacy, and variety of colouring. In some species the tints are\r\nintensely vivid as the shifting lights of the aurora borealis, or the\r\nglowing hues of an autumnal sunset; in others pale and delicate as the\r\nfirst indications of coming morn, or the scarcely-perceptible tinge of a\r\njust expanding flower-bud; in some the colours are arranged in patterns,\r\nregularly disposed; in others, in masses and blotches, of varying shapes\r\nand degrees of intensity; in some again they seem to change and melt one\r\ninto the other, like the prismatic hues of the rainbow. In all, whether\r\ndistinct and unconnected, or intimately blended, whether regular or\r\nirregular, they are beautiful exceedingly. Nor is their beauty of an\r\nevanescent, that is fading, or vanishing character; unlike plants and\r\nanimals, which when once dead, are extremely difficult of preservation.\r\nShells, being composed of particles already in natural combination, are\r\nalmost indestructible; unless exposed to the action of fire, or some\r\npowerful acid, they will remain the same for ages, requiring no care or\r\nattention, beyond occasionally removing the dust, which would collect\r\nupon and defile their pearly whiteness, or obscure the brilliancy of\r\ntheir colours.\r\n\r\nSo easily collected, arranged, and preserved, and withal so singular and\r\ngraceful in form, and rich and various of tint, one cannot wonder that\r\nShells have always had a conspicuous place in all museums, and other\r\ncollections of natural history objects; neither can we feel surprised\r\nthat a high value should have been set upon rare specimens; as much as\r\na thousand pounds it is said has been given for the first discovered\r\nspecimen of the _Venus Dione_; another shell called the _Conus cedo\r\nnulli_, is valued at three hundred pounds; and the _Turbo scaloris_,\r\nif large and perfect, is worth one hundred guineas; while the _Cypræa\r\naurantium_, or Orange Cowry, if it has not a hole beaten through it, will\r\nfetch fifty guineas. It has been calculated that a complete collection of\r\nBritish Conchology is worth its weight in silver.\r\n\r\nThe following quotation is from “The Young Conchologist,” by Miss\r\nRoberts;—our readers will do well to peruse it attentively:—“We admit\r\nthat shells are beautiful, and that they are admirably adapted to the\r\nexigencies of the wearers; but how shall we account for the endless\r\ndiversity of shades and colours, varying from the sober coating of the\r\ngarden snail, to the delicate and glowing tints which are diffused over\r\nsome of the finer species, in the infinite profusion of undulations,\r\nclouds and spots, bands and reticulated figures, with which these\r\nadmirable architects enrich the walls of their beautiful receptacles. The\r\nmeans of producing them must be sought for in the animals themselves.\r\nTheir necks are furnished with pores replete with colouring fluid, which\r\nblends insensibly with the calcareous exudation already noticed, and\r\nthus occasions that exquisite variety in their testaceous coverings,\r\nwhich art attempts to emulate, but can never fully equal. Thus far is\r\nthe result of observation and experiment. It now remains to account for\r\nthe extraordinary fact that the stony exudations of testaceous animals\r\ncondense only on those parts where they are essential to their welfare.\r\nBut here investigation ends—the microscope has done its office. It\r\nseems as if material nature delighted to baffle the wisdom of her sons,\r\nand to say to the proud assertors of the sufficiency of human reason\r\nfor comprehending the mysteries of creation and of Providence, ‘Thus\r\nfar can you go, and no farther; even in the formation of a shell, or\r\nits insignificant inhabitant, your arrogant pretensions are completely\r\nhumbled.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF SHELLS.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of shells as ornaments, and objects worthy of our study and\r\nadmiration, we have already mentioned some of their uses, for surely that\r\nwhich contributes to the intellectual improvement and innocent pleasure\r\nof mankind, is in its degree useful. But on the more narrow ground of\r\nutility, shells may also claim a high place in our estimation. To man in\r\na barbarous and uncivilized state, they furnish the means of performing\r\nsome of the most important operations of daily life, being extensively\r\nused as a substitute for iron. The savage frequently forms his knife, his\r\nhunting spear, and his fish-hook of hard shell. Lister relates that the\r\ninhabitants of Nicaragua, in South America, fasten a shell, called the\r\n_Ostrea virginica_, to a handle of wood, and use it as a spade. In North\r\nAmerica the natives use a blue and white belt composed of shells called\r\nthe _Venus mercenaria_, as a symbol of peace and unity, and there too\r\nthe gorget of the chieftain’s war-dress is composed of the pearl-bearing\r\nmussel, called by naturalists _Mytilus margaritiferus_. Many African\r\ntribes use the _Murex tritonis_ as a military horn, and a rare variety of\r\nthis shell, which has the volutions reversed, is held sacred, and used\r\nonly by the priests. Among the Friendly Islanders the Orange Cowry is a\r\nsymbol of the highest dignity. The Money Cowry, (_Cypræa moneta_,) forms\r\nthe current coin of many nations of Africa; and a certain number of these\r\nshells strung together, are considered by the slave-hunting chiefs, as\r\nan equivalent for so many black-skinned brothers, whom they sell into\r\nhopeless bondage.\r\n\r\nAmong nations, too, in a high state of civilization, shells are often\r\nused for economical as well as ornamental purposes. To say nothing of\r\nmother-of-pearl, which is converted into so many articles useful as well\r\nas pretty, scallop, or oyster shells, are frequently employed as scoops\r\nby druggists, grocers, and the like; and in the country the dairy-maid,\r\nwith the larger kinds of the same shell, skims her milk, and slices her\r\nbutter; while sometimes by the poor people of both towns and villages,\r\nthe deeper specimens are converted into oil lamps. One very important\r\nuse, my young readers will understand, when I speak of a ragged urchin,\r\nwho shouts to every passer-by—‘Please remember the grotto!’\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, we are told, the people of Athens recorded their votes\r\non public occasions, by marks upon a shell, thus Pope says—\r\n\r\n    “He whom ungrateful Athens would expel,\r\n    At all times just, but when he signed the shell;”\r\n\r\nin allusion to this custom, of which we are reminded by such English\r\nwords as _Attestation_, a certifying, a bearing witness; _Testify_, to\r\ngive evidence; _Testament_, a will, or written disposal of property,\r\netc.; all having their origin, it appears, in the Latin _testa_—a shell.\r\nIn ancient poetry we find the word _Testudo_ used to signify a musical\r\ninstrument, also called a lyre or lute, which instrument, according to\r\ntradition, was first made by passing strings, and straining them tightly,\r\nover the shell of a tortoise. So the poet Dryden, describing those who\r\nlistened to the music drawn from this simple invention, says—\r\n\r\n    “Less than a God they thought there could not dwell,\r\n        Within the hollow of that shell\r\n            That spoke so sweetly.”\r\n\r\nA Greek writer, called Apollodorus, gives this account of the invention\r\nof music by the Egyptian god Hermes, more commonly known as Mercury. The\r\nNile having overflowed its banks, and laid under water the whole country\r\nof Egypt, left, when it returned to its usual boundaries, various dead\r\nanimals on the land; among the rest was a tortoise, the flesh of which\r\nbeing dried and wasted by the sun, nothing remained within the shell\r\nexcept nerves and cartilages, or thin gristly bones; these being shrunk\r\nand tightened by the heat, became sonorous, that is sounding. Against\r\nthis shell Mercury chanced to strike his foot, and pleased by the sound\r\ncaused thereby, examined the shell from which it came, and so got a\r\nnotion, as we say, how he might construct a musical instrument. The first\r\nwhich he made was in the form of a tortoise, and strung with the dried\r\nsinews of dead animals, even as are the lutes, harps, and fiddles of the\r\npresent day. This fanciful mode of accounting for the origin of music, is\r\nthus alluded to by a writer named Brown:—\r\n\r\n            “The lute was first devised\r\n    In imitation of a tortoise’ back,\r\n    Whose sinews parched by Apollo’s beams,\r\n    Echoed about the concave of the shell;\r\n    And seeing the shortest and smallest gave shrillest sound;\r\n    They found out frets, whose sweet diversity\r\n    Well touched by the skilful learned fingers,\r\n    Roused so strange a multitude of chords.\r\n    And the opinion many do confirm,\r\n    Because _testudo_ signifies a lute.”\r\n\r\nAnd now we are among the myths and fables of antiquity, we may just\r\nmention another application of the shell to musical purposes. Neptune,\r\nwho, according to the Grecian mythology, was the god of the sea, is\r\nfrequently represented as going forth in his car in great state and pomp,\r\nwith a body-guard of Tritons; some of whom go before with twisted conch\r\nshells as trumpets, with which we are to suppose they make delightful\r\nharmony. Venus, too, the goddess of beauty, rode on the ocean foam in a\r\ntestaceous car. Thus Dryden says, that Albion—our native land, so called\r\non account of its chalky cliffs, from the Latin _alba_—white:—\r\n\r\n    “Was to Neptune recommended;\r\n    Peace and plenty spread the sails;\r\n    Venus in her shell before him,\r\n    From the sands in safety bore him.”\r\n\r\nBut without believing all these fables, more poetical than true, we may\r\nsoon convince ourselves that in the hollow chambers of a shell, there\r\ndoes seem to dwell, like an imprisoned spirit, a low sad kind of music.\r\nAn English poet, named Walter Savage Lander, has well described this in\r\nthese lines—\r\n\r\n                  “Of pearly hue\r\n    Within, and they that lustre have imbibed\r\n    In the sun’s palace porch, where, when unyoked,\r\n    His chariot wheel stands midway in the wave;\r\n    Shake one, and it awakens; then apply\r\n    Its polished lips to your attentive ear,\r\n    And it remembers its august abodes,\r\n    And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there.”\r\n\r\nWordsworth, too, gives a beautiful description of a child applying one of\r\nthese pearly musical-boxes to his ear.\r\n\r\nMany other uses of shells might be mentioned, to show that they perform\r\nan important part in the operations of nature, as the means and modes\r\nby and in which God sees fit to order the affairs of this world are\r\nfrequently called; and also promote the ends of science, and the arts of\r\nevery-day life. By the decomposition of the shells, of which they are\r\npartly composed, solid rocks frequently crumble to pieces, and spreading\r\nover a considerable surface, form a fruitful soil for the nourishment\r\nof vegetation. The character of the testaceous deposits, too, enable\r\ngeologists, as those who study the nature and structure of the earth\r\nare termed, to come to important conclusions on many points connected\r\nwith the subject of this investigation. And if we include, as the\r\nsubject of our book allows, the inhabitants of shells, how wide a field\r\nof usefulness opens before us. How many thousands of our industrious\r\npopulation depend wholly, or in part, upon the capture and sale of\r\nshell-fish for their support. In some parts, as the western and northern\r\nIslands of Scotland, they have in times of scarcity afforded sustenance\r\nto the dwellers on the bleak and barren shores, who but for them must\r\nhave perished. But of all this we shall have more to say when we come\r\nto describe the different members of the testaceous family. We will now\r\noffer a few remarks upon\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INHABITANTS OF SHELLS;\r\n\r\nWhich belonging to that division of Natural History called the\r\n_Mollusca_, from the Latin _Mollis_—soft; these _Molluscous_ animals,\r\nthen, are animals having a soft body, and no internal skeleton. You may\r\nbe quite sure that a _Mollusk_ will never break its bones, because it has\r\nnone to break; it has a shell, however, which may be broken, at least in\r\nsome cases, for all _Mollusks_ have not snug habitations of the kind; but\r\nwander about the watery or earthy world in which they live, quite naked;\r\nsuch as the sea and land slugs, and some worms, leeches, etc.: but with\r\nthese we have nothing to do, our present subject including only a part of\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACOLOGY,\r\n\r\nanother member of that queer ology family, deriving its name from two\r\nGreek words signifying soft, and a discourse; hence it means a discourse\r\nupon soft, or soft-bodied, animals, that is _mollusca_. It is only a part\r\nthen of _Malacology_ that we have to do with; that part which relates\r\nto the shell-inhabiting mollusks, and strange creatures enough some\r\nof these are. We will have a look at them presently; just now it will\r\nbe sufficient to observe that the _mollusca testacea_, or soft-bodied\r\nanimals, furnished with shells, possess the power of exuding, that is,\r\ndischarging from various parts of their bodies a sticky kind of fluid,\r\nwhich mixing with the chalky matter collected from the water, and\r\nbecoming hard, forms, in process of time, the shelly covering which is at\r\nonce a dwelling and a defence for the inhabitant.\r\n\r\nMiss Pratt, in her delightful book on “Common Things of the Sea Coast,”\r\nobserves of these shells that, “We gather up those which we find, and\r\nlooking at their structure would fain know something of the inmate of\r\nsuch a dwelling. All nature proclaims the goodness of God. We hear that\r\nthe bird which wings its way over our heads has a song of joy; the bee\r\nhums delightedly by us; and the little shrimp which darts in the clear\r\npool, seems full of merriment. Was the inmate of the shell less cared\r\nfor by its Maker? No doubt the little builder had some sense of joy, as\r\nhe framed from his own substance the house which excites our admiration.\r\nDoubtless his existence, short and sluggish as it was, had its own\r\nconsciousness of pleasure; and obscure as is his history, and little\r\ncalculated as such a creature might seem to perform an important part\r\nin the economy of creation, yet we know that he had a work to do, not\r\nonly for the living creatures of the sea, but for the well-being of man\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF SHELLS.\r\n\r\nThe great naturalist Linnæus divided shells into thirty-six genera,\r\neach of which comprised a number of species; of these species somewhere\r\nabout two thousand five hundred have been described and classified; the\r\nvarieties, more or less distinct, are almost countless. Of shells found\r\non and about the British Isles, there are about five hundred and fifty\r\nspecies, or, we should rather say were, for diligent enquirers into this\r\nbranch of Natural History, are almost daily adding to the number.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that shells are sometimes called _Crystalline_,\r\nand sometimes _Granular_, in accordance with certain peculiarities of\r\nconstruction before mentioned: this is one mode of division; there are\r\nseveral others made use of in different systems of arrangement, which\r\nonly a deeper study of the subject than can be here entered upon, would\r\nenable one to understand; the plainest and most common, however, is that\r\nwhich has reference to the form of the shell, which is one of these—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  UNIVALVE.

Barnacle.]\r\n\r\nThese words are derived from the Latin, _unus_—one, _bi_—two,\r\n_multus_—many, and therefore it may at once be seen that they apply to\r\nshells having one, two, or several pieces or divisions. Valve comes from\r\nthe Latin _valva_, and means a folding door, a lid, a piece moving on a\r\nhinge, as the divisions in several of these shells do.\r\n\r\nThis order of arrangement is generally followed by those who make a\r\ncollection of shells for a cabinet; and to this we shall adhere as at\r\nonce the most simple and convenient, when we come to describe the several\r\nspecies of testaceous mollusks. We will now say a few words on\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING AND PRESERVING SHELLS.\r\n\r\nA diligent searcher along any beach or coast line, will be sure sometimes\r\nto light upon curious and valuable specimens, and especially after\r\nviolent storms may such be sought for, with the greatest chance of\r\nsuccess, for the agitation of the waters will then have loosened them\r\nfrom their natural beds and dwelling-places, and cast them on the shore.\r\nVery frequently, however, they will be so beaten about and defaced, that\r\nthey will be comparatively valueless; if enveloped in tangled masses of\r\nsea-weed, they are likely to be preserved from injury; and such heaps\r\nof uprooted marine vegetation will often afford a rich harvest to the\r\nyoung conchologist, who should always carefully examine them. Many of the\r\nshells are so minute as scarcely to be seen with the naked eye, therefore\r\nthis search can scarcely be properly effected without the assistance of a\r\npocket lens, the cost of which is but trifling. The undersides of pieces\r\nof stranded timber, the bottoms of boats lately returned from a fishing\r\nvoyage, the fisherman’s dredge or net, the cable, and the deep-sea\r\nline; all these may prove productive, and should be looked to whenever\r\nopportunity offers; nor should the search for land and fresh-water shells\r\nbe neglected, for many of these are very curious, as well as beautiful,\r\nand no conchological collection is complete without them. For these, the\r\nbest hunting grounds are the ditch side and the river bed, the mossy\r\nbank and the hedge-row; amid the twining, serpent-like roots of the old\r\nthorn and elder trees; the crevices of the garden wall, the undersides of\r\nstones, and all sorts of out-of-the-way holes, nooks, and corners, where\r\nmay be found the Striped Zebra, and other prettily-marked snail shells,\r\nand many other kinds worthy of a place in—\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET;\r\n\r\nwhich may be either large or small, plain or handsome, in accordance\r\nwith the means of the collector. Perhaps for a beginner just a nest of\r\nshallow drawers in a deal or other case, may be quite sufficient; these\r\ndrawers should be divided into compartments, on the front side of each\r\nof which should be pasted a neatly written label, with the common and\r\nscientific name of the species of shell contained in it, together with\r\nbrief mention of the date when, and the place where, it was taken; and\r\nany observations relating to it which can be comprised in a few words,\r\nand may seem to the collector of sufficient interest to warrant their\r\ninsertion. This would be a good beginning; by and by, when the collection\r\nis large, the knowledge more ample, and the outlay can be spared, it will\r\nbe time to think of something ornamental—mahogany and glass, and carved\r\nor inlaid work, such a Cabinet as would properly display and enhance the\r\nbeauties of your testaceous treasures, which are too often stowed away,\r\nwith other natural curiosities, in a very disorderly, higgledy-piggledy\r\nsort of manner, like the collection described by Dryden.\r\n\r\n    “He furnishes his closet first, and fills\r\n    The crowded shelves with rarities of shells;\r\n    Adds orient pearls, which from the wave he drew,\r\n    And all the sparkling stones of various hue.”\r\n\r\nWhen live shells, as they are called, that is having the living fish\r\nin them, are obtained, the best plan is to place them in spirits of\r\nwine, this at once deprives the inhabitant of life, without injuring\r\nthe shell, which should then be placed in hot water for a time, the\r\nbody of the mollusk is thus rendered firm, and may be removed by means\r\nof some pointed instrument; care should be taken to leave no portion of\r\nanimal matter within, or after a while it will become putrid and give\r\nout a stain, which will show through and injure the delicate markings\r\nof the shell; the surest, most expeditious, and least troublesome mode\r\nof cleansing a shell, is to place it in an ant heap for a day or two;\r\nthe busy little insects will penetrate into its inmost cavities, and\r\nremove hence all offending matter. There will be no difficulty in this\r\nrespect with the multivalve and bivalve kinds, which are only kept closed\r\nby means of a set of muscles, which can be tightened or relaxed at the\r\npleasure of the animal within, and become powerless to keep the shell\r\nclosed as soon as that is dead. Great care must be taken to preserve\r\nunbroken the smaller parts of these shells, such as the hinges or teeth,\r\nas on the structure of these the scientific arrangement into genera\r\nchiefly depends; the beard also, as it is called, and silky threads, must\r\nnot be removed, as these have much to do in determining the particular\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nRiver and land shells are generally very thin and brittle, and must be\r\ncarefully handled; their colours are not usually so brilliant as those\r\nof the marine species, but they form links in the testaceous chain, which\r\nare necessary to a proper study and elucidation of conchology.\r\n\r\nThe most glowing and gorgeous of all shells are those brought from the\r\nTropical seas, and, excepting in a few rare instances, specimens of most\r\nof these can be obtained at little cost from any dealer, or from sailors\r\nreturning from a voyage. If it is necessary to send either those, or\r\nBritish shells, any distance, or to pack them away in a small compass,\r\nthe best plan is to wrap them separately in soft paper, place them in a\r\nbox, and then pour in sawdust, bran, or fine sand, very dry, until all\r\nthe open spaces are completely filled up.\r\n\r\n\r\nON CLEANING AND POLISHING SHELLS.\r\n\r\nAll shells, whether inhabited or not, when taken should be soaked for\r\na while in hot water, to remove the dirt which may adhere to them, and\r\ndissolve the saline, that is salt, particles contained in the sea water;\r\nthey should then be thoroughly dried, and if, as is the case with many,\r\nthey naturally possess a good polish, they are at once fit for the\r\ncabinet. Generally, however, it happens that when shells are dry, they\r\nlose much of the peculiar brilliancy of hue, which they possess when seen\r\nthrough the medium of the glistening water; to restore this, wash them\r\nover with a thin solution of gum arabic, or white of egg; some collectors\r\nuse a varnish made of gum mastic, dissolved in spirits of wine; this is\r\nperhaps preferable, as it is not affected by moisture. Many shells have\r\na very plain, dull, appearance, in consequence of being covered over\r\nwith a kind of skin called an epidermis, a word derived from the Greek,\r\nand signifying the outer skin, sometimes called the cuticle. To remove\r\nthis, soak the shell in warm water for some time, and then rub it over\r\nwith a stiff brush until the covering is removed; should this be very\r\nthick, it will be necessary to mix a little nitric acid with the water,\r\nbut this must be done very cautiously, for if too strong it will remove\r\nall the lustre from the surface of the shell subjected to its influence.\r\nSometimes the file, and a substance called pumice stone has to be used,\r\nbut these are dangerous agents in inexperienced hands. The best polish\r\nfor the shell after the skin is removed, is a red earth called tripoli,\r\napplied on a piece of soft leather.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL SHELLS.\r\n\r\nAn eminent Geologist, named Dr. Mantell, has very beautifully and\r\npoetically termed rocks “The Medals of Creation.” As on coins and\r\nmedals we see stamped enduring records of great historical events, so\r\nupon the rocks are written by the finger of God, a history of some of\r\nthe mighty changes which the earth has undergone, and fossil shells are\r\namong the plainest and most easily read of the characters or letters, in\r\nwhich these truths are written. As Dr. Harvey, in his “Sea-side Book,”\r\nobserves, “Shelly-coated mollusca have existed in the waters of the sea\r\nand in rivers, from a very early period of the world’s history, and\r\nhave left in its most stratified rocks and gravels abundance of their\r\nshells preserved in a more perfect manner than the remains of most other\r\nanimals. Now as the species in the early rocks differ from those found\r\nin later formations, quite as much as the latter from the mollusca of\r\nour modern seas, the gradual change in the character of the embedded\r\nshells marks a certain interval of time in the world’s history.” So we\r\nsee that these rocks are the leaves of a great book, written all over\r\nwith wonderful truths, and those who study such sciences as Geology and\r\nConchology, are enabled to read much that is there written.\r\n\r\nEvery fossil shell that such a student picks out of the chalk, or\r\nlimestone, is like a letter in the Alphabet of Creation; it has a\r\nsignificance, or meaning, and a number of such put together, form as\r\nit were, words and sentences, that can be made up into chapters, full\r\nof instruction, aye, and of amusement too. The study may seem a little\r\ndry at first, but never mind, go on, and you will soon be rewarded for\r\nyour diligence, by the wonders that will unfold themselves to your\r\nunderstanding—the fresh and delightful views which you will obtain into\r\nthe wide universe, the new and enlarged ideas of the wisdom and goodness\r\nof the Creator, and of the formation, habits, and connexion each with\r\neach of his various creatures.\r\n\r\nProperly to treat of fossil shells, would require a book of itself, and a\r\nlarge book too; we can here but allude to the subject, as a part, and a\r\nvery important and interesting part of the study of Conchology; more will\r\nbe said about it in a volume which we purpose writing for this series, on\r\nRocks, and the petrified organic remains found in and about them.\r\n\r\n    “Those relics of an older world, which tell\r\n      Of changes slow or sudden, that have past\r\n    Over the face of nature; fossil shell,\r\n      Shark’s tooth, and bone of megatheran vast,\r\n    Turned into stone, and so preserved to show\r\n    Man of those things whereof he ought to know.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL SHELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIVALVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGasteropoda is a name given by some naturalists to a very extensive\r\ngroup of molluscous animals; the term is derived from two Greek words,\r\nsignifying stomach and foot;—it has reference to the kind of fleshy\r\nfoot which generally occupies the whole under side of the body, and by\r\nthe contraction and extension of the muscles of which, the creature is\r\nenabled to glide, with a slow but steady motion, from place to place.\r\nThe Slug and the Snail are the commonest examples which can be adduced\r\nof _gasteropods_; and one may tell by their slimy tracks, shining like\r\nsilver in the morning sunshine, that during the night, which is their\r\nprincipal feeding time, they manage to get over a considerable extent of\r\nground, although “a snail’s gallop” is a proverbial expression for slow\r\nmotion; but it is astonishing how much work of any kind may be done if\r\none “keeps at it;” by doing this the Tortoise beat the Hare, illustrating\r\nthe truth of the proverb, that “slow and sure wins the race.” If you\r\nwatch a Snail travelling with its house upon its back, it does not seem\r\nto make much way, and you are inclined to think that it will be long ere\r\nit reaches the new settlement to which it appears journeying with bag\r\nand baggage; but leave the spot for a while, and the chances are that on\r\nyour return, the “slow coach” will have got somewhere out of sight. Here\r\nis a lesson for boys and girls; whatever you take in hand, don’t be in a\r\nhurry, and if people say you are “slow,” think of the snail, and keep on!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis, then, is a shelled mollusk of the third class, called\r\n_Gasteropoda_, according to the system of the French naturalist Cuvier.\r\nIt has a distinct head, which, like the hinder part of the body, which\r\nwe may call a tail if we like, projects, when the creature is in motion,\r\nconsiderably from the shell; it is also furnished with what we commonly\r\ncall horns, naturalists say _tentacles_, from the Latin _tento_—trying,\r\nor essaying; with these the creature, as it were, feels its way; being\r\nextremely sensitive; they answer the purpose of organs both of sight and\r\ntouch; put your finger slowly towards one of them, and you will observe\r\nthat, even before contact, it begins to retract, or draw in, as though\r\nsensible of the approach of some opposing body, as it no doubt is. These\r\nhorns of the snail, then, are its feelers—eyes to the blind, fingers\r\nto the fingerless; so God provides for his creatures all that may be\r\nnecessary for their existence, and compensates for the deprivation of one\r\nsense or organ, by some admirable contrivance which meets the necessities\r\nof the case.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] It appears likely that the little knobs at the end of the snail’s\r\nfeelers, are, as some naturalists assert, in reality eyes; if so, we\r\nwere wrong in calling the creature blind. Yet is their position and\r\nconstruction so different from organs of sight generally, that they serve\r\nrather to strengthen than invalidate the above observations. The number\r\nof the horns varies in different kinds of snails from two to six, and\r\nsome have none at all. These tentacles, when present, are always situated\r\nabove the mouth; some of them have the knobs at the base, others at the\r\nsides; and it has been conjectured that they may be organs of smell, as\r\nwell as of sight and touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON SNAIL\r\n\r\nIs called by naturalists _Helix aspersa_, the generic name being\r\nderived from a Greek word signifying spiral, and having reference to\r\nthe shape of the shell; the plural is _Helices_, a term applied to all\r\nconvoluted or twisted shells, which terminate in a point like a church\r\nspire: a spiral-shelled fossil is called a _helicate_. The specific\r\nname comes from the Latin _asper_—rough, whence also our English word\r\n_asperity_—roughness, and several others. The _Helicidæ_, or _Helix_\r\nfamily, is that which includes the land shell Snails and the naked Slugs,\r\nand in this family there are several genera; they are distinguished from\r\nthe shelled water Snails, both sea and river, by having a different\r\nbreathing apparatus, and some other points of internal construction which\r\nit is not necessary to describe here.\r\n\r\nThe Common Snail has a mouth, of which it makes good use, as market\r\ngardeners well know, and yet this mouth is not furnished with teeth;\r\ninstead of these, the upper lip, which is of a horny texture, is what\r\nis called _dentated_, from the Latin _dentus_—a tooth, that is, divided\r\nor separated, so as to present somewhat the appearance of a row of\r\nteeth in the jaw; this lip is of an arched form, and appears to be a\r\nvery serviceable kind of instrument to Mr. _Helix aspersa_, who, if\r\nhis character be not _aspersed_, is very destructive to all sorts of\r\ngreenery. The lower lip is divided only in the middle, where there is an\r\nopening of some width: it is not horny, like the upper one.\r\n\r\nSnails lay eggs, which are about the size of very small peas; they are\r\nsoft, and of a whitish colour. Being semi, that is, half, transparent, or\r\nclear, their contents can be partly seen; and in those of a water Snail,\r\ndeposited against the side of a glass bottle, the young were detected\r\nwith partially formed shells upon their backs.\r\n\r\nTo shew how tenacious they are of life, it has been mentioned that Mr.\r\nS. Simon, a Dublin merchant, had a collection of fossils and other\r\ncuriosities left him by his father; among these were some shells\r\nof Snails, and _fifteen years_ after the collection came into his\r\npossession, his son had the shells to play with, and placed them in a\r\nbasin of water, when lo! out came the slimy bodies and knobbed horns of\r\nseveral of the _Gasteropods_, no doubt hungry enough after their long\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nWe all know that our Common Snails hybernate, or sleep through the\r\nwinter. As soon as the chills of autumn are felt, they seek out some snug\r\ncrevice in an old wall, or burrow in the earth, or congregate beneath\r\ngarden pots, roots of trees, thatched roofs, or in any hole or corner\r\nthat may be convenient, and then throwing a kind of temporary skin, like\r\na drum head, which naturalists call _operculum_, over the opening of\r\ntheir shells, and sticking themselves fast to the sides of their refuge,\r\nor to each other, they sleep away, careless of frosts and tempests.\r\n\r\nA moist and rather warm state of the atmosphere seems most congenial to\r\nthe land Snails, some species of which are found in all countries, except\r\nthose where the most intense cold prevails. Generally speaking, they\r\ndo not like dry heat, and to escape from it will get under stones, and\r\ninto other cool places, from whence a shower brings them forth in such\r\nnumbers, the smaller species especially, as to lead to the popular belief\r\nthat it sometimes rains Snails.\r\n\r\nThese _Gasteropods_, although extremely injurious to vegetation, must\r\nnot be regarded as worse than useless, as they commonly are; besides\r\nfurnishing food for several wild, as well as domesticated, birds, they\r\nare no doubt a nourishing article of diet for man. The Romans had their\r\n_cochlearia_, where Snails were regularly fed and fattened for the table;\r\nand the French at the present day their _escargotoires_, or Snailery, for\r\nthe same purpose; some of the Snails so kept, attain an immense size, as\r\nwell they may if fed, as by the Romans, on new wine and meal. Many poor\r\npersons, especially those who are consumptive, might no doubt derive much\r\ncheap sustenance and benefit from using the larger species of _Helicidæ_,\r\nwhich might be collected from hedges and gardens as food. Why should they\r\nnot eat those as well as the marine mollusks, such as Oysters, Cockles,\r\nWhelks, etc.\r\n\r\nSnails have an extraordinary power of re-producing any part which may be\r\ninjured or cut off, even to the extent of the whole head, as has been\r\nobserved to be the case; the reparation of injury done to the shell\r\nthey can effect easily, as can all testaceous mollusks. Respecting the\r\nconstruction of the shell it may be observed that it is produced in the\r\nthickness of the mantle, or cloak-like covering which envelopes the body\r\nof the animal; the formation commences at the small end or spire, and\r\ngradually goes on, whorl upon whorl, as the still widening circles which\r\ngive the ridgy appearance to most univalves, are called. _Columella_,\r\nor _pillar_, is the name given to the spire on which the cones are\r\nrolled; this is sometimes solid, and sometimes hollow; when the latter,\r\nthe open end is called the _Umbilicus_, meaning the navel or centre.\r\nThe opening at the bottom, from which the animal issues, is the last\r\nportion finished, and this is called the _aperture_, a Latin word adopted\r\ninto the English dictionary. Some of these _Helices_ are wide and flat,\r\neven hollow and cup-like, with the whorls rising above the pillar—these\r\nare called _discoid_ shells; others which are long and narrow, with\r\nprojecting spires, are termed _turbinated_ shells; the former being\r\nmore or less flat or disk-like, the latter twisted, whirling, like a\r\nspinning-top, from the Latin _turbo_—a whirling, a turning round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISCOID.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURBINATED.]\r\n\r\nIf we take a Common Snail, and plunge it into boiling water, which will\r\ninstantly kill it, so that it can be removed from the shell, we shall\r\nfind the whole of that part of the body which was lodged in the upper\r\nwhorls, or spiral part of the shell, is covered with a thin membrane\r\nor skin; this is called the _mantle_, and that portion of it which\r\ncorresponds with what we may consider as the back of the mollusk, and\r\nwhich is considerably thickened, is termed the _collar_; here are\r\nsituated the glands, which secrete the colouring and other matter of\r\nwhich the shell is mainly composed; although the substance called nacre,\r\nor mother-of-pearl, is secreted in the thinner part of the mantle; it\r\nis however from the collar that the growth or increase of the shell\r\nproceeds. It is in accordance with certain variations in the shape and\r\ndisposition of this mantle and collar, that shells assume such very\r\ndifferent shapes. Sometimes the whorls or spiral ridges, are projected or\r\nthrown far out, and this produces the _turbinated_ shell. Sometimes they\r\nscarcely rise above each other, but rather spread towards the sides, and\r\nthen we have the _discoid_ shape. Generally speaking, the whorls of a\r\nshell take a direction from left to right, but occasionally an opposite\r\none; they are then called sinistral, or left-handed shells: such are\r\nnot common. If one of the twisted shells be divided length-ways, it will\r\nbe seen that the inside of the whorls wind in an ascending direction,\r\nround the _Columella_, or central column, as the spiral staircases in the\r\nCrystal Palace.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to our Garden Snail, who has many near relatives in\r\nBritain, several of which have beautifully-marked and convoluted shells,\r\nas will be seen by a reference to our coloured illustrations, Plate I.\r\nWe will introduce them in due order. Fig. 1, the Banded Snail, (_Helix\r\nnemoralis_,) from the Latin _nemus_—a wood or grove; the prettily-striped\r\nshells of this species may be found in great plenty among the roots and\r\nin the crevices of the rugged boles of old forest trees, as well as in\r\nhedge-rows and in mossy banks, and other situations near woods. Fig. 2,\r\nthe Heath Snail, (_H. ericetorum_,) from _erica_, the Latin for heath;\r\na small species with brown bands, remarkable for its large _umbilicus_,\r\nperforating the centre of the shell nearly through. Fig. 3, the Silky\r\nSnail, (_H. sericea_,) from the Latin _sericus_—silk-like; the shell\r\nof this species is covered with short slimy hairs, which give it a\r\nglistening appearance. Fig. 4, the Stone Snail, (_H. lapicida_,) from\r\nthe Latin _lapis_—a stone: Linnæus called the species the Stone Cutter,\r\nprobably on account of its habit of frequenting stony places, and the\r\npeculiar construction of the shell, which has a sharp edge running round\r\neach whorl; it is commonly found lodged in the cavities of loose-lying\r\nstones, but which it can scarcely be suspected of having hollowed out for\r\nits own accommodation.\r\n\r\nFig. 5, the Elegant Cyclostome, (_Cyclostoma elegans_.) On turning to the\r\ndictionary, we find that _cyclostomous_ means having a circular mouth.\r\nThis species is sometimes called _Turbo elegans_; the beautifully-marked\r\nshells are often found in chalk-hills covered with brushwood. This\r\npretty mollusk has a curious mode of travelling; the under surface of\r\nthe foot, which is long, is divided by a deep fissure, into two narrow\r\nstrips, like ribbons; these take hold of whatever the creature may be\r\nmoving on alternately; one keeping fast hold while the other advances,\r\nin like manner to fix itself, and drag the body forward. Fig. 6, the\r\nUndulated Plekocheilos, (_P. undulatus_;) the Latin _plecto_—to twist or\r\ntwine, seems to be the root from which the generic name of this Snail\r\nis derived; the specific name will be easily understood; to undulate,\r\nis to flow like waves, and the lines on the shell it will be seen are\r\nundulating. This is not a British species, but is introduced here to\r\ngive variety to the group; it is a West Indian Mollusk, and is found in\r\nimmense numbers in the forests of St. Vincent; it glues its eggs to the\r\nleaves of a plant which holds water, and thus secures for them a damp\r\natmosphere at all times. And here we must conclude our chapter of Land\r\nSnails, leaving unnoticed very many beautiful and interesting species,\r\nboth British and Foreign.\r\n\r\nMany poets have alluded to the Snail, but we can only find room for a few\r\nverses by Cowper:—\r\n\r\n    To grass, or leaf, or fruit, or wall,\r\n    The snail sticks close, nor fears to fall,\r\n    As if he grew there, house and all\r\n                                Together.\r\n\r\n    Within that house secure he hides,\r\n    When danger imminent betides\r\n    Of storm, or other harm besides,\r\n                                Of weather.\r\n\r\n    Give but his horns the slightest touch,\r\n    His self-collecting power is such,\r\n    He shrinks into his house with much\r\n                                Displeasure.\r\n\r\n    Where’er he dwells, he dwells alone,\r\n    Except himself has chattels none,\r\n    Well satisfied to be his own\r\n                                Whole treasure.\r\n\r\n    Thus hermit-like, his life he leads,\r\n    Nor partner of his banquet needs,\r\n    And if he meets one only feeds\r\n                                The faster.\r\n\r\n    Who seeks him must be worse than blind,\r\n    (He and his house are so combin’d,)\r\n    If, finding it, he fails to find\r\n                                Its master.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH-WATER SHELLS.\r\n\r\nMany of the following group of Fresh-water Shells, are remarkable for\r\nelegance of form, and some for richness of colouring; hence, perhaps,\r\nthe scientific name applied to the family in which they are mostly\r\nincluded—_Limnæidæ_, which, like _limn_—to paint, agrees with the French\r\n_enluminer_. These mollusks are found in rivers, streams, ditches, and\r\nmoist marshy places. Like those which live wholly on land, they breathe\r\nthrough lungs, and therefore cannot exist without air; which accounts for\r\ntheir frequently coming to the surface, when under water. In brooks, as\r\nwell as in stagnant pools, which abound with aquatic plants, they may be\r\nfound in vast numbers, feeding upon the moist vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Common Limnea, (_L. stagnalis_,) is mostly an inhabitant of stagnant\r\nwaters, where it is often seen floating with the shell reversed, as in\r\na boat; this shell, like most of those of the Fresh-water Mollusks,\r\nis thin, and easily broken; the shape it will be seen, is peculiarly\r\nelegant, the spire being slender and pointed—very different from that\r\nof the Spreading Limnea, called by naturalists, _L. auricularia_,\r\nfrom _aurus_—the ear, to which the broad aperture, or opening of the\r\nshell, may be compared; this resembles the other species in its habits.\r\nThe Horny Planorbis, in Latin _P. corneus_, from _cornu_—a horn. The\r\nshape, you will see, is flat, the whorls rolling upon each other like\r\nthe folds of a bugle horn; this shape would be termed orbicular, from\r\n_orbis_—a sphere, or circular body. This is the largest European species\r\nof Fresh-water Shells so constructed; it is often found in deep clear\r\nditches, and yields a beautiful purple dye, which, however, soon becomes\r\ndull, and changes; it cannot be fixed, and is therefore valueless. The\r\nmouth of this shell in fine specimens, is tinged with pale violet or\r\nlilac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is another kind, the Keeled Planorbis, (_P. lurinatus_,) which\r\nhas the outer edge of the shell finely ridged, or keeled; it is very\r\nsmall, and very plentiful in fresh-water, both running and stagnant;\r\nwhere, too, is found the Common Physa, (_P. fontinalis_,) the latter word\r\nmeaning a spring or fountain. This little mollusk is a quick and active\r\ntraveller, it sometimes comes out of its shell, and throws itself about\r\nin an extraordinary way, keeping fast hold by its foot; the generic name,\r\n_Physa_, would seem to have reference to the round, smooth, delicate\r\nshell, and to come from the same root as _Physalite_, which means a\r\ntopaz: the members of this genus are very numerous, being found nearly\r\nall over the globe. The next belongs to the family _Auriculadæ_, or Ear\r\nShells. The Midas’ Ear, (_A. Midæ_;) this handsome shell is prized by\r\ncollectors; it comes from the East Indies. Midas, it is said, was one who\r\nset himself up for a judge of music in the old fabulous times, and not\r\nappreciating that of Apollo, was rewarded by the angry god with a pair of\r\nass’s ears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Cone-shaped Melampus, (_M. corniformis_,) also an Ear Shell, is\r\nfound in the rivers of the Antilles Islands. It is a pretty shell; the\r\nformation is much the same as that of many of the most highly-prized\r\nvarieties of Marine Shells; of these we shall have to speak presently.\r\n_Melampodium_ in Latin, signifies a poisonous plant called Black\r\nHelebore; in the Mythology, _Melampus_ was a great magician, who did all\r\nsorts of wonderful things; but we cannot tell what relation there exists\r\nbetween either the plant or the magician and this pretty cone shell. To\r\ngive variety to this group, we will now throw in a land species called\r\n_Megaspira Ruschenbergiana_, about the origin of whose name we cannot\r\neven hazard a guess; the termination of the generic name, you will see\r\nis _spira_, and a glance at the shell will at once suggest a reason\r\nfor this; its long tapering spire consists of twenty-three closely-set\r\ngradually increasing whorls. This is a rare shell, whose inhabitant has\r\nnot yet been described by naturalists; several of the marine species\r\nclosely resemble it in shape. Much more might be said about the Land and\r\nFresh-water Shells, but we must here leave them, having a wide field\r\nbefore us, namely, the Sea or Marine _Testacea_, one of the most common\r\nof which is\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHELK,\r\n\r\nA univalve shell inhabited by a gasteropod mollusk, or, we should rather\r\nsay, naturally so tenanted, for very frequently it is taken possession of\r\nby the Soldier or Hermit Crab, which having no hard covering to protect\r\ntheir soft plump bodies, are obliged to take lodgings where they can\r\nget them, and generally prefer the Whelk shell, of which we here give a\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is one of the commonest of our Marine Mollusks; it is called by\r\nnaturalists _Buccinum undatum_; the first, or generic term, being the\r\nLatin for a trumpet, and the second, or specific name, meaning waved, or,\r\nas we often say, undulated. So we call this the Waved Whelk; fishermen\r\nterm it the Conch, or the Buckie, and tell strange stories of its\r\nravenous appetite and murderous propensities; how, with its spiny tongue,\r\nsituated at the end of a long flexible proboscis or trunk, it drills a\r\nhole in the shell of the Oyster, or other testacean, and sucks out the\r\ncontents; empty shells, so drilled, are frequently found on the shore,\r\nand often, when the dredge is let down into an oyster bed, it comes up\r\ntime after time filled with Whelks, of which such numbers are sometimes\r\ntaken, that they are sold to the farmers to be used as manure for the\r\nsoil. This mollusk is a favourite article of food with the poorer classes\r\nof our land, but it is hard and indigestible. The shell may frequently\r\nbe found in large numbers among the beach stones; it is strong and firm,\r\nfrom three to four inches long, of a dirty yellowish white. There are\r\ntwo other Whelks common upon our coasts—the Stone or Dog Whelk, (_B.\r\nlapillus_,) from the Latin _lapis_—a stone, and _B. reticulatum_, so\r\ncalled because the shell is _reticulated_, or marked with many lines\r\ncrossing each other, like net-work; it comes from the Latin _reticulum_—a\r\nnet; hence also we have _reticule_—a small work bag, at one time very\r\nmuch carried by ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCK SHELLS,\r\n\r\nAre so called on account of their rough and wrinkled forms; they are\r\nnearly allied to the Whelks, to which they bear a close resemblance.\r\nSeveral species are found on our shores, the most common being the Humble\r\nMurex, (_M. despectus_,) from the Latin _despecto_—to despise; this is\r\noften used by the fishermen for bait. Some of the foreign Rock Shells\r\nare very curious and beautiful; three of them will be found on Plate\r\nII.—Figs. 1, 2, and 3. The Common Thorny Woodcock, (_M. tribulus_,)\r\nfrom the French for trouble, whence we have also tribulation, which is\r\nsometimes said to be a thorny path. This curious shell is also called\r\nVenus’ Comb. It is found in the Indian Ocean, from whence it is also\r\nbrought. Fig. 2, the Woodcock’s Head, (_M. haustellum_,) from the Latin\r\n_haustus_—a draught; the bill of the Woodcock being adapted for sucking.\r\nThis term is also applied to insects that live by suction. The shell, it\r\nwill be seen, is destitute of spines, but it is ribbed and beautifully\r\nmarked. Fig. 3 is worthy of its name—the Royal Murex, (_M. regius_,)\r\nfrom _regno_—to reign. It is a splendid species, of the rich colouring\r\nof which, art can give but a faint impression. It is brought from the\r\nwestern coast of Central and South America, where, as well as in the\r\nislands of the South Pacific, many new shells of the genus _Murex_ have\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne shell found on our own coast, often mistaken for a Whelk, is the\r\nPelican’s-foot Strombus, called in scientific language, _Strombus\r\npes-pelicanus_, which is but a Latinized form of the English name. This\r\nshell varies greatly in shape in different stages of its growth, and by\r\nan inexperienced conchologist, the young, middle-aged, and old Strombus,\r\nmight be taken for distinct species. In the _Strombidæ_ family, so called\r\nwe know not why, the same word in Latin meaning a kind of shell-fish,\r\nare some species which have produced pearls. One member of the family\r\nwhich we sometimes see in collections, is a large and very beautiful\r\nshell; this is the Broad-winged Strombus, (_S. latissimus_,) probably\r\nfrom _latesco_—to wax or grow broad, or large; _issimus_ being in the\r\nsuperlative degree, would indicate that this shell was very much so, as\r\nwe find it is, sometimes measuring as much as twelve inches across. In\r\nPlate II, is a representation of this handsome shell, greatly reduced\r\nin size, of course: see Fig. 4. We here give a figure, as more curious\r\nthan beautiful, of the Scorpion Pteroceras, (_P. scorpius_,) which also\r\nbelongs to the _Strombidæ_ family; as does the curious Chinese Spindle,\r\n(_Rostellaria rectirostris_.) The generic name of the first of these\r\nspecies, comes from the Greek _Ptero_, pronounced _tero_, meaning a\r\nwing, and _cerus_—waxen. Both the generic and specific names of the\r\nsecond refer to the peculiar conformation of the shell, being derived\r\nfrom the Latin, and meaning a straight line or beak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE SPINDLE.]\r\n\r\nOn Plate III, will be found the Imbricated Purpurea, (_P. imbricata_,)\r\nFig. 1, which claims a close alliance with the Whelks. The generic name\r\nhas reference to the dye yielded by this, as well as all the shells\r\nof the genus; the specific name comes from the Latin _imbrex_—the\r\ngutter-tile; thus _imbricated_, a term often used in Natural History,\r\nmeans ridged, like the roof of a house, where the tiles are placed to\r\noverlap each other, so that the rain will run off. The Persian Purpura,\r\nor, as it is called in Latin, _Purpura Persica_, Fig. 2, is another\r\nhandsome shell of this family group; its name indicates the place where\r\nit is found. The other species described comes from South America, and\r\nthe _P. lapillus_, (the meaning of the specific name has already been\r\nexplained,) is common on our shores, being found in great abundance on\r\nthe rocks at low waiter. We read in scripture, of Tyrian purple, and\r\nthere is every reason to suppose that the rich colour was obtained from\r\nthese and other shell-fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIWINKLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is the commonest representative which we have of the family\r\n_Turbinidæ_, which comprehends, according to Cuvier, all the species\r\nwhich have the shell completely and regularly _turbinated_, that is, if\r\nwe translate the Latin word into English, twisted. The little Periwinkle,\r\n(here he is,) is by no means a handsome mollusk, but some of his\r\nrelatives are very beautiful as we shall presently show. He is called\r\nby naturalists _T. littoreus_, from _littoralis_—belonging to the shore,\r\nand often eaten by boys and girls with great relish; but he is not very\r\ndigestible, and sometimes occasions dangerous disorders. The Swedish\r\npeasants believe that when the Periwinkle crawls high upon the rocks, a\r\nstorm is brewing from the south; but Linnæus quotes a Norwegian author\r\nto shew that according to popular belief, it foretells the approach of a\r\nland wind with a calm on shore. Man may learn much of elemental changes\r\nfrom an observation of the movements and habits of all living creatures,\r\nwhich are instructed by God to provide for their safety and wants, and\r\noften perceive, long before man himself does, the indications of calm\r\nand tempest, rain and drought, etc. But our little _Turbo_, what of him?\r\nwill you boil him, and pick out his curled-up form with a pin? or let him\r\ngo crawling about the rocks, feeding upon the delicate earlier growth of\r\nmarine vegetation? In the former case, you will have to reject the little\r\nkind of horny scale attached to his foot, which forms, when he retires\r\ninto his habitation, a closely-fitting door to make all snug.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of this genus are found on our shores; one of those is\r\nthe _Turbo rudis_, or Red Turbo, which has a very thick periwinkle-like\r\nshell, about three-quarters of an inch long; the colour is dull red,\r\nfawn, or drab.\r\n\r\nOf the foreign _Turbinæ_, sometimes called Turban Shells, we will now\r\nintroduce two or three species, which will be found on Plate III. Fig. 3\r\nis the Marbled Turbo, (_T. marmoratus_,) from the Latin _marmor_—marble;\r\na large handsome shell well known to conchologists, and a native of the\r\nIndian seas. Fig. 4 is the Twisted Turbo, (_T. torquatus_;) this shell,\r\nwhen deprived of its outer coat or layer, is beautifully _nacreous_, or\r\nif we may so speak, mother-of-pearly. The specimens which have reached\r\nEngland were brought from King George’s Sound. Fig. 5 is called Cook’s\r\nTurbo, (_T. Cookii_:) this is a handsome South Sea shell, oftentimes\r\nof large size. It has been found in great numbers on the coast of New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\nOn Plate IV, we have placed two very curiously formed and marked shells,\r\ncalled Wentletraps, also belonging to the family _Turbinidæ_. The\r\nscientific name is _Scalaria_, from the Latin _scala_—a ladder, which the\r\nribbed shells are supposed to resemble. Of this genus there are about\r\neighty distinct species known; they are mostly deep-sea shells found in\r\nwarm latitudes, although several inhabit the European seas, and one, the\r\nCommon False Wentletrap, (_S. communis_,) Fig. 1, may often be picked up\r\non our own shores. Fig. 2, the Royal Staircase Wentletrap, is a rare and\r\nvaluable shell, generally brought from India and China; the scientific\r\nname is _S. pretiosa_, given to it by the French Naturalist Lamarck, on\r\naccount of the high price which it fetched, _pretiose_, in Latin, meaning\r\ncostly, valuable. As much as £100 have been given for a single specimen\r\nof this shell; and a fine one, especially if it exceed two inches in\r\nlength, yet commands a considerable sum, although not nearly so much as\r\nthat. A good deal like the False Wentletrap in general outline, is the\r\nAwl-shaped Turritella, found in the African and Indian Seas. This is the\r\n_T. terebra_ of naturalists; the first name referring to the turret shape\r\ncommon to the genus, and the last being the Latin word for an auger, or\r\npiercer. The Roseate Turritella, (_T. rosea_,) is also sometimes seen in\r\ncollections; the beautiful rosy tint of the live shell changes to a dull\r\nred or brown, on the death of the mollusk.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROCHUS, OR TOP-SHELL.\r\n\r\n“Of the shelled Mollusca which the dredge ever and anon brings up,”\r\nsays Mr. Gosse, in his delightful volume on the _Aquarium_, or\r\n_Aqua-vivarium_, as the glass tank in which living marine animals\r\nand vegetables are kept, is called, from the Latin _aqua_—water, and\r\n_vivo_—to live, “the _Trochi_ are among the most conspicuous for beauty.\r\nThe chief glory of this genus is the richly-painted internal surface of\r\ntheir shells, in which they are not excelled by any even of the true\r\nmargaritiferous or pearly bivalves.”\r\n\r\nOf this _Trochidæ_ family, a few of the members must be introduced to\r\nour readers; it is rather a numerous one, consisting of more than one\r\nhundred species, which are scattered nearly all over the world, few\r\nseas being without some of them. They are found at various depths, from\r\nnear the surface to forty-five fathoms down, creeping on rocks, sand,\r\nmasses of sea-weed, etc. We will first speak of those found on our own\r\nshores, the two commonest, as well as the smallest of which, are the Grey\r\nand the Spotted Trochi, scientifically named _T. cinerarius_ and _T.\r\nmaculata_, the translation of the first Latin specific name being ashy\r\nor ash-coloured, and that of the second, spotted. _Trochus_, in the same\r\nlanguage signifies a top, and has reference to the shape of most of these\r\nshells, which are something like a boy’s whip-top.\r\n\r\nChildren on the coast sometimes call the last-named of the above species\r\nPepper-and-salt Shells, because in colour they resemble the cloth so\r\nnamed. The Muddy-red Trochus, (_T. ziziphinus_,) so called, perhaps,\r\nbecause in colour it resembles the ziziphia, or fruit of the jujube tree,\r\nis also common with us. This shell is about an inch long, of a grey tint\r\ndashed with dark spots, these follow the line of the spiral turnings,\r\nwhich are very regular, proceeding from the opening below to the apex or\r\npoint. Seen on shore, its colours are dull and faint, but beneath the\r\nwater, inhabited by a living mollusk, it looks as though made of pearl,\r\nand studded with rubies; the animal, too, is richly coloured, being\r\nyellow with black stripes.—See Plate IV, Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nNot so common as the last is another British mollusk of this genus,\r\ncalled the Granulated Trochus, (_T. granulatus_.) It is the larger, and,\r\nas many think, the more elegant shell of the two, being in colour, a\r\nfaint flesh tint or yellowish white, shaded here and there with purple;\r\nthe spiral lines which encircle it are composed of small round knobs\r\nwhich stand out like beads.\r\n\r\nThere is a singular shell of this genus, called the Carrier Trochus, (_T.\r\nphorus_;) it is generally found loaded with foreign objects, such as\r\nshells, small stones, bits of coral, etc., which it attaches to itself,\r\nand so goes about like a collector of natural curiosities, with his\r\ncabinet on his back.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Trochus, (_T. imperialis_,) Fig. 4, whose scientific name\r\nexplains itself, is one of the handsomest shells of the genus; it is very\r\nrare, and has hitherto been found only at New Zealand. Let us give our\r\nyoung readers a specimen of the way in which scientific writers describe\r\nshells; thus, this foreign Trochus, they tell us is “orbicularly conical,\r\nthe apex obtuse, the whorls turgidly convex, squamoso radiate at the\r\nmargin.” This is quite a simple affair to some descriptions, and simple\r\nin fact it is to one, who, by attentive study, has become familiarized\r\nwith the meaning of the terms. To one also who is acquainted with the\r\nGreek and Latin tongues, they will be sufficiently plain, although he\r\nhas never seen them applied before, for they are all derived from those\r\ndead languages, as they are called, and so convey their own meaning\r\nto every educated naturalist, no matter of what nation he may be; and\r\nhence their chief value. It is not necessary for our readers to trouble\r\nthemselves about the meaning of such terms at present; by and by it will\r\nbe necessary for them to do so, if they wish to prosecute the study of\r\nany natural science.\r\n\r\nBut about the Imperial Trochus, with its “orbicularly conical” shell—that\r\nterm we may explain as round and cone-like; a reference to Fig. 4, Plate\r\nIV, will shew what is meant by this more clearly than words can, and\r\nlikewise exhibit the beautiful markings of this species, with its ground\r\ntint of rich violet brown. This beauty is often obscured by calcarious\r\nincrustations, and marine plants, shewing that the mollusk is sluggish in\r\nits habits—a slothful creature. So it is with human beings, sloth covers\r\nand hides the good qualities and virtues with an overgrowth at all times\r\ndifficult to remove, and oftentimes destructive of all that is fair and\r\ngood in the character.—Children, be not slothful! The Obelisk Trochus,\r\n(_T. obeliscus_,) is a rare white and green shell, sometimes seen in\r\ncollections; it is of a conico-pyramidal form, not remarkable for beauty,\r\nand is a native of the Indian seas.\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse speaks of the Tops and Winkles as among the most useful\r\ninhabitants of the Aquarium; they mow down with their rasping tongues\r\nthe thick growth of _Confervæ_ which would otherwise spread like a green\r\ncurtain over the glass walls of the tank, and obstruct the view of its\r\ninhabitants. Here is this author’s description of the beautiful piece of\r\nmechanism by which this work is effected:—“The appearance and position\r\nof the organ would surprise any one who searched for it for the first\r\ntime, and as it is easily found, and as Periwinkles are no rarities, let\r\nme commend it to your examination. The easiest mode of extracting it,\r\nsupposing you are looking for _it_ alone, is to slit the thick muzzle\r\nbetween the two tentacles, when the point of a needle will catch and\r\ndraw out what looks like a slender white thread, two inches or more in\r\nlength, one end of which is attached to the throat, and the other, which\r\nis free, you will see coiled in a beautiful spiral manner, within the\r\ncavity of the stomach.\r\n\r\nBy allowing this tiny thread to stretch itself on a plate of glass, which\r\nis easily done by putting a drop of water on it first, which may then be\r\ndrained off and dried, you will find that it is in reality an excessively\r\ndelicate ribbon, of transparent cartilaginous substance or membrane, on\r\nwhich are set spinous teeth of glassy texture and brilliancy. They are\r\nperfectly regular, and arranged in three rows, of which the middle ones\r\nare three-pointed, while on each of the outer rows a three-pointed tooth\r\nalternates with a larger curved one, somewhat boat-like in form. All the\r\nteeth project from the surface of the tongue on hooked curves, and all\r\npoint in the same direction.”\r\n\r\nAnd with this curious piece of mechanism the little Winkle works away and\r\ncuts down swathe after swathe of the minute vegetation, just as a mower\r\ndoes the meadow grass; only the mollusk eats as he goes, and so gets\r\npayment for his labour; the man has it in another and to him more useful\r\nform. We might tell a very long story about these Tops and Winkles, which\r\nare nearly related to each other, but must now pass on to describe the\r\nrest of the shells on Plate IV, which are the Perspective Solarium, (_S.\r\nperspectivum_,) Fig. 5, the generic name comes from _sol_—the sun, and\r\nviewed perspectively, that is, in such a position that the whole top of\r\nthe shell is at once presented to the view, looking like a flat surface,\r\nit presents a circular appearance, marked with rings and rays like\r\nrepresentations of the sun sometimes do.\r\n\r\nThe Variegated Solarium, (_S. variegatum_,) Fig. 6, is a small but very\r\npretty shell, somewhat rare. The mollusk is remarkable on account of the\r\nsingular shape of its operculum, which differs from that of all other\r\nspecies; it is of a cone-shape, and covered from top to bottom with what\r\nare called membranous lamellæ, that appear to stand out like little\r\nshelves winding up spirally. This singular form of operculum has been\r\nlong known to naturalists, but it is not until lately that they have\r\ndiscovered to what species of testacean it belonged. Let us here explain\r\nthat _operculus_ is the Latin for a cover or lid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONES, VOLUTES, MITRES, AND OLIVES.\r\n\r\nThese are names given by collectors to certain classes of univalve shells\r\ndistinguished by peculiarities of formation, more or less distinct. We\r\nshall describe two or three of each, that our readers may have some idea\r\nof the meaning of the terms which are often used by those who speak or\r\nwrite on conchology.\r\n\r\nThe family of Cones, called _Conidæ_, is an extensive one, considerably\r\nabove two hundred species having been discovered. Many of them are very\r\nbeautiful both in shape and colour, so that they are highly valued by\r\ncollectors; they are principally found in the southern and tropical\r\nseas, upon sandy bottoms, at depths varying from a few feet to seventeen\r\nfathoms. The shells are generally thick and solid, rolled up, as it were,\r\ninto a conical form; the most familiar illustration that can be given of\r\nthis form is a sugar-loaf, which all these shells more or less resemble\r\nin general outline, as thus—\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCones are either plain or coronated, that is, crowned, having rows of\r\nprojections round the top of the shell, like the second of the above\r\nfigures; and this forms a mark of division into two classes, although\r\nthese classes often run, as it were, one into the other; some plain cones\r\nhaving slight irregularities of surface, and some crowned ones being very\r\nnearly plain.\r\n\r\nThe Common, or Ordinary Cone, (_Conus generalis_,) Plate V. Fig. 1, is an\r\nelegantly-shaped and beautifully-marked shell, having much the appearance\r\nof being carved out of some rare kind of marble. The Lettered Cone,\r\n(_Conus littoralis_,) Fig. 2, appears to be scribbled over with Hebrew,\r\nGreek, or Arabic characters, and almost every species has something\r\npeculiar in its markings; clouds and veins, and dots, and stripes, and\r\nbands, of every conceivable shape and mode of arrangement, may be met\r\nwith in these shells, whose surface, when the epidermis, or outer skin\r\nis removed, bears a beautiful polish. Curious names have been given to\r\nsome of them, such, for instance, as the High Admiral, Vice Admiral, and\r\nGuinea Admiral, which indicate the rank they hold in the estimation of\r\ncollectors. From five to twenty guineas is the price at which good and\r\nrare ones have been valued, and one, the _Conus cedo nulli_, which may\r\nbe translated, the Cone second to none, has fetched the enormous sum of\r\nthree hundred guineas. It must not be supposed that these shells exhibit\r\nall their beauties when, inhabited by a carnivorous, or flesh-eating\r\nmollusk, they move slowly about, or lie for a time motionless among\r\nthe rocks and sand-beds of the ocean. The before-mentioned epidermis,\r\nwhich is the Latin for the outer skin of the human body, covers them\r\nlike a cloak or mantle, which is the name it bears among naturalists.\r\nMuch careful labour is required to bring them to a fit state for cabinet\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nVOLUTES form an extensive family of shells under the name _Volutinæ_. The\r\ngreater part are natives of tropical seas, and dwell far down so that\r\nthey are seldom found on the coast, except after storms. There are a few\r\nEuropean species, but these are not remarkable for beauty, as most of\r\nthe others are. The generic name signifies twisted, or rather wreathed,\r\nas flowers or leaves might be, about some central object. In these\r\nshells the spire is generally short, as it is in many cones, sometimes\r\nscarcely apparent; the form is usually elegant, and the markings often\r\nstriking and handsome. On Plate V, will be found three examples—Fig. 3\r\nis the Undulated Volute, (_V. undulata_,) the Latin for a little wave\r\nis _undula_, and these marks are like the lines caused by the flowing\r\nof the waves on a sandy shore: this shell is found chiefly in the South\r\nPacific; the animal which inhabits it is prettily-marked with zebra-like\r\nstripes. Fig. 4 is called the Pacific Volute, (_V. Pacificus_;) the\r\nshape, it will be seen, is somewhat different, being more angular, and it\r\nis without the waved lines. Fig. 5, the Bat Volute, (_V. vespertilio_,)\r\nis more decidedly knobbed or spiked, approaching nearly to the shape of\r\nsome of the coronated ones. This species is found in the Indian seas; the\r\nspecific name is the Latin for a bat.\r\n\r\nMITRES; these are usually considered as a genus, or branch of the\r\nVolute family; the scientific name is _mitra_, the form is generally\r\nlong, slender, and pointed—something like the bishop’s mitre, hence the\r\ncommon name of the genus. In the Episcopal Mitre, (_M. episcopalis_,)\r\nPlate VI, Fig. 1, we see this form in its greatest perfection; this is a\r\nhandsome shell found in the Indian seas, and on the coasts of the South\r\nSea Islands. The mollusk is remarkable for a long proboscis, double the\r\nlength of the shell, the extremity of which swells into a club form, and\r\nhas an oval orifice or opening: the specific name _episcopalis_, comes\r\nfrom the Latin, and means of, or like a bishop. The Tanned Mitre, (_M.\r\nadusta_,) from the Latin _adustus_—burned or parched, is, what is called\r\nfusiform and turretted, that is, shaped like a spindle, and having a\r\nspire or turret-like termination. The streaks of colour are transverse,\r\nthat is, running the length of the shell, or in other words, they are\r\nlongitudinal; this, too, comes from the South Sea Islands. Fig. 2 is the\r\nWrinkled Mitre, (_M. corrugata_,) from the Latin _corrugo_—to wrinkle; it\r\nis very different both in shape and markings, from the last species; the\r\nwhorls, it will be seen, are angulated or pointed above, and the lower\r\npart of the shell is much larger than the spiral or upper portion. It is\r\na true mitre nevertheless, although not just such a one as a bishop would\r\nlike to wear. It inhabits the Indian Ocean, the coast of New Guinea, etc.\r\n\r\nOLIVES; these, for richness of colour and brilliancy of effect, will\r\nbear comparison with any genus of shells. Naturalists speak of them\r\ncollectively as _Olivinæ_; they belong to the Volute family, and are said\r\nto number about eighty species. Most of those which have reached this\r\ncountry, have come from the Mauritius, where they catch them with lines\r\nbaited with portions of Cuttle-fish. We have here depicted two of them,\r\nnamely, the Figured Olive, Fig. 3, (_Oliva textilina_,) from the Latin\r\n_textilus_, which is woven or plaited; and the Ruddy Olive, Fig. 4, (_O.\r\nsanguinolenta_,) from _sanguis_—blood.\r\n\r\nWe must now bring our notice of the Univalves to a conclusion; there are\r\nseveral genera, and many very curious and beautiful species which we have\r\nbeen unable to notice at all, and of those which we have, a short account\r\nonly could be given; sufficient however, as we trust, to interest our\r\nreaders in the subject, and induce them to continue the study of it into\r\nlarger works. Before leaving this division of shells, we would call their\r\nattention to one of its greatest ornaments, that is the Ventricose Harp\r\nShell, (_Harpa ventricosa_,) from the Latin _ventriculus_—the stomach,\r\napplied to this shell on account of its swelled or inflated shape.\r\nNothing, however, can be more elegant than the whole form, nor more\r\nbeautiful than the markings of this lovely species, (see Plate VI, Fig.\r\n5,) which belongs properly to the Whelk family.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWRIES.\r\n\r\nOf Cowries we have already spoken in our chapter on the Uses of Shells,\r\nthey are among the commonest of our testaceous ornaments, and are\r\nremarkable, especially the foreign kinds, for richness and diversity of\r\ncolour, and the high polish which they bear. The native species are small\r\nplain shells, commonly called Pigs, from some real or fancied resemblance\r\nwhich they bear to the swine; they are pretty little white-ribbed shells,\r\nand are tolerably plentiful on various parts of the British coasts. There\r\nare three kinds, namely, the Louse Pig, or Nun Cowry, the Flesh-coloured,\r\nand European Pig Cowries. The first of these is of a pale reddish colour,\r\nwith six square black spots on the back; the second is a beautiful rose\r\ntint; and the third is ash-coloured or pinkish, with three black dots,\r\nand a white streak down the back. The Money Cowry, (_Cypræa moneta_,)\r\nused as current coin in many parts of India, as well as on the coast of\r\nGuinea, is a yellow and white shell, with a single band of the former\r\ncolour; it is small of size, and is sometimes called the Trussed Chicken,\r\nfor the same reason as the term Pigs is applied to its British relatives.\r\nThese Cowries are obtained principally about the Phillippine Islands,\r\nthe Maldive Islands, and the coast of Congo, where, after high tides,\r\nthe women collect them in baskets mixed with sand, from which they are\r\nafterwards separated and cleaned, when they are ready for the market.\r\n\r\nThey are only useful as coin so long as they remain unbroken. The value\r\nof a single shell is very small, as the following table will shew:—Four\r\nCowries make one gunder; twenty Gunders one punn; four Punns one anna;\r\nfour Annas one cahaun; and four Cahauns one rupee. The value of the\r\nlatter coin is equal to two shillings and threepence, English money,\r\nand this would be exchangeable for five thousand one hundred and twenty\r\nCowries; so that it would never do to pay large sums in this kind of\r\ncoin: a waggon would be required to convey a few pounds with. In this\r\ncountry the Money Cowries are frequently used as markers or counters in\r\nsocial games; they are generally white, in shape rather broad and flat,\r\nbeing much spread out round the edges, which are slightly puckered, like\r\nfrills. Here are two figures of the shell, exhibiting the back and front\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn Plate VII, will be found a group of other Foreign Cowries, most\r\nof which will be recognized as familiar ornaments of the mantel and\r\nside-board. Fig. 1 is the Spotted or Leopard Cowry, sometimes also\r\ncalled the Tiger Cowry, (_C. tigris_,) which, in the earlier stages of\r\nits growth, is simply marked with broad bands of lighter colour across\r\nthe shell. Fig. 2, the Map Cowry, (_C. mappa_,) curiously marked and\r\nshaded, so as to resemble a coloured map; there are several varieties of\r\nthis beautiful shell, such as the rosy and dark variety from the Pearl\r\nIslands, in the Indian Ocean; the Citron and Dwarf Rich-mouthed variety,\r\nfrom the Mauritius. Fig. 3, the Mole Cowry, (_C. talpa_,) the last word\r\nbeing the Latin for a mole, is of a more slender form than most other\r\nspecies of the _Cypræidæ_ family, so called on account of their beauty,\r\n_Cyprea_ being a name of Venus, the goddess of beauty. Any one who has\r\nseen a mole, must be struck with the resemblance of its general outline\r\nto this shell, of which there is a darker-coloured variety of somewhat\r\nstouter form, called _exustus_—burned or scorched. Of the Poached-egg\r\nCowries there are several species, the most common is called by\r\nnaturalists _Ovulum ovum_, Fig. 4, from _ovum_—an egg; the back of this\r\nshell is much elevated and rounded; it is smooth and white; the inside\r\nis orange brown. Some of the Poached-egg group are of a more slender and\r\nangular shape, as, for instance, that called the Gibbous, (_O. Gibbosa_;)\r\nthe moon when more than half-full, is called gibbous, that is rounded\r\nunequally, as this shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFew shells undergo greater changes, both of shape and colour, during\r\nthe process of growth, than the Cowries, which are called in France\r\nPorcelaines, on account of their high polish and brilliant hues; a single\r\nspecies in different stages of development, might well be, and often is,\r\ntaken for distinct shells. Much might be said about the Mollusks which\r\ninhabit them, but our present subject has rather to do with their outer\r\ncovering than their internal structure. The most rare and valuable,\r\nif not the most beautiful of these Cowries, is the _C. aurora_, or\r\n_aurantium_, Morning-dawn, or Orange Cowry, a perfect specimen of which\r\nhas been sold for fifty guineas. There is a very curious shell called\r\nthe Common Weaver’s Shuttle, (_Oculum volva_,) generally included in the\r\n_Cyprea_ family; of this a representation will be found on Plate VII,\r\nFig. 5. This is brought from China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIVALVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcephalous Mollusks, with Bivalve Shells, is the name given by modern\r\nnaturalists to the class of animals of which we have now to speak; the\r\nonly one of these terms which will require explanation is the first; it\r\ncomes from the Greek, and means headless, so an Acephalan is a molluscous\r\nanimal without a head, as\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OYSTER,\r\n\r\nWhich may be considered as the King of Bivalves; his palace, to be sure,\r\nis somewhat rough and rugged outside, but within, its walls are smooth\r\nand polished, lustrous and iridescent, and altogether beautiful; of a\r\nnacrous or pearly appearance, now flushing into a rose tint, now fading\r\ninto pure white, and adorned sometimes with goodly pearls of price; truly\r\nthis monarch of the _Conchifers_ has a habitation worthy of a prince,\r\nwherein he lives in right royal state. Our readers may smile perhaps at\r\nthe idea of the solitary Oyster doing this, down there on his mud bank\r\nor rocky anchorage ground, shut up in his dirty-looking shells, and\r\nholding, as it seems, commune with no one, not even his fellow mollusks;\r\nhow can he be said to live in royal state, or indeed any state at all,\r\nexcept in a most weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable one? And this only\r\nshews how erroneously those often judge who do so hastily, and from first\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\nIf we take a peep through a microscope, under the direction of a\r\nnaturalist named Rymer Jones, we shall see that “the shell of an Oyster\r\nis a world occupied by an innumerable quantity of animals, compared\r\nto which the Oyster itself is a colossus. The liquid enclosed between\r\nthe shell of the Oyster contains a multitude of embryos, covered with\r\ntransparent scales, which swim with ease; a hundred and twenty of these\r\nembryos, placed side by side, would make an inch in breadth. This liquid\r\ncontains besides, a great variety of animalculæ, five hundred times less\r\nin size, which give out a phosphoric light. Yet these are not the only\r\ninhabitants of this dwelling—there are also three distinct species of\r\nworms.”\r\n\r\nLet us see if there are any hard names here that want explaining before\r\nwe go any further. The first we stumble upon is _Colossus_, which comes\r\nfrom the Latin, and means a great image or statue, like that which\r\nancient historians tell us once bestrode the entrance to the harbour of\r\nRhodes. _Embryo_ comes from the Greek, and means something small and\r\nunfinished, that is to expand or grow into a more perfect form, as the\r\nseed into a plant. _Animalculæ_, are minute or very small animals, such\r\nas cannot be distinguished without the help of a microscope, hence they\r\nare sometimes called microscopic animals; this word comes from the Latin\r\n_animalis_, which means having life. _Phosphoric_ signifies luminous,\r\nor giving out light. The Greek name of the morning star is _Phospha_.\r\nIn Latin, _Phosphorus_ is a term applied to a substance which chemists\r\nextract from bones and other animal matter, and which, when exposed to\r\nair, burns with a pale blue light, like that emitted by the glow-worm.\r\nMany of the oceanic or sea animalculæ are exceedingly phosphorescent, so\r\nthat by night, the waves appear like billows of flame. Of this luminosity\r\nof the ocean, as it is termed, we shall have to speak on another\r\noccasion. We will now return to the Oyster, who, it will be seen, is by\r\nno means so solitary in his bivalve palace as might be supposed. He has\r\nhis torch-bearers, and other attendants, quite a host of them, no doubt\r\nmagnificently dressed, if we could but see them to advantage, and well\r\ninstructed in the several duties which they have to perform. Oh yes,\r\ncertainly, as the Irish poet has said,\r\n\r\n    “Of all the Conchiferous shell-fish,\r\n      The Oyster _is_ surely the King;”\r\n\r\nShall we continue the quotation? and say\r\n\r\n    “Arrah Mick, call the people who sell fish,\r\n      And tell them a dozen to bring:\r\n    For it’s I that intend to demonstrate,\r\n      The creature’s phenomena strange,\r\n    Its functions to set every one straight,\r\n      And exhibit their structure and range.”\r\n\r\nScarcely will our limited space permit us to do this, but a few of the\r\nmost remarkable particulars about this common Acephalan, we feel called\r\nupon to set before our readers.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, it belongs to the class _Conchifera_; this is a word which\r\nwe must stop to examine a little; it seems to come from the Latin\r\n_concha_, which means a shell-fish with two shells, in other words a\r\nbivalve mollusk. Second, our Oyster belongs to the class _Pectinidæ_.\r\nNow _pecten_ is the Latin for a comb, and this class includes those\r\nbivalve shells whose edges are toothed, or, as it is said, _pectinated_;\r\nin the scallop and the cockle shells this peculiarity is more observable\r\nthan in those of other members of the class, and these form the\r\ntypical, or so to speak, pattern genus, _pecten_. Thirdly, the Common\r\nOyster is a _Monomyarian Conchifer_. Ah! that’s something like a name\r\nfor the acephaloid monarch! Look at these two words, _mono-myarian_,\r\n_di-myarian_, you know of course that mony-syllable means one syllable,\r\nand dis-syllable means two. You sometimes hear of a person who leads\r\na _monotonous_ life, and you think perhaps of the Oyster shut up in\r\nhis shell all alone, _one_ by himself; this notion you now know to be\r\na false one; although it is true that he has but one abductor muscle,\r\nand therefore belongs to the division of the _Pectinidæ_ family called\r\n_Monomyaria_, while the Pearl Oyster has two, and therefore belongs to\r\nthat termed _Dimyaria_. If, as they say, there is reason in the roasting\r\nof eggs, surely there must be in the names given to the classes and\r\ndivisions of shells. We hope to have succeeded in making the why and the\r\nwherefore in this case somewhat plain;—_one_—_two_—and away we go out\r\nof this maze of hard names. But what about the abductor muscle, above\r\nspoken of? well, this must be explained; _abduce_, coming from the Latin\r\n_abduco_, means to separate, to draw away, hence we have _abduction_.\r\nDuring the life of an Oyster, the usual and natural state of the shell\r\nis that of being kept open for a little distance, to allow the water\r\nnecessary for its nourishment and respiration to flow in and out; but\r\nas a security against danger, it was necessary to furnish the animal\r\nwith the means of rapidly closing the shell, and retaining the valves\r\nin a closed state. These actions being only occasional, yet requiring\r\nconsiderable force, are effected by means of a muscular power, for which\r\npurpose one or two, or sometimes more strong muscles are placed between\r\nthe valves, their fibres passing directly across from the inner surface\r\nof one to that of the other, and firmly attached to both, and these are\r\ncalled the abductor muscles, because their office is to draw or pull;\r\nhow strongly they do this those whose business it is to open Oysters can\r\nbest tell; if the animal within were not alive, the process would not be\r\na difficult one, as in that case the muscles would be relaxed, and the\r\nshell would come open of itself, so that actually people who eat Oysters\r\ndirectly they are opened, swallow them “all alive-O!”\r\n\r\nIf a pair of the shells from which the delicious morsel has been\r\nextracted, be taken in the hand, it may be noticed that one is much\r\nthinner, smoother, and flatter than the other; this is the side most\r\nexposed to the action of the water; the rougher and rounder side is that\r\nwhich is attached to the rock, or other substance to which the animal\r\nforms an attachment, that is usually life-long. The two portions of the\r\nshell are joined together by a hinge of curious workmanship, which is\r\nformed of the inner layer of the shell, and strengthened by a ligament\r\nwhich is wonderfully elastic; when the shell is drawn together by the\r\nabductor muscles, the ligament is at full stretch, and as soon as they\r\nrelax at all, it contracts, and causes the shell to gape. This process is\r\nrepeated as often as may be necessary for the safety and sustenance of\r\nthe animal within, whose mouth is situated at the narrowest part of its\r\nhabitation, namely, near the joint of the hinge, which connects its upper\r\nand under shell. The anatomical structure of the Oyster is more perfect\r\nthan would be supposed, from its apparently low state of organization;\r\nit has a heart, liver, and intestinal canal, and a bag near the mouth,\r\nwhich answers the purpose of a stomach. Its breathing organs are gills,\r\nclosely resembling those of most other fish; it has little vessels which\r\nconvey the bile from the stomach to the liver, and may perhaps be subject\r\nto bilious attacks, as well as those who swallow this curious piece\r\nof organization at a mouthful, without thinking at all of the goodly\r\nstructure they are demolishing. There is the tiny heart with its series\r\nof blood-vessels, just as perfect as in the larger animals. There are\r\nthe nerves in the shape of minute feelers, which appear to be acutely\r\nsensible not only of actual contact with foreign bodies, but also of\r\nsounds and movements from without. A very nice sense of feeling appears\r\nto reside in what is called the beard, in scientific language _bissus_;\r\nthis is a kind of double fringe to the two lobes of the mantle, or sac,\r\nas it is called, which envelopes the body of the animal, and floats free\r\nfrom the shell, except just at the part nearer the valve where it is\r\nattached.\r\n\r\nWe have just spoken of the beard of the Oyster, and this reminds us of\r\na conundrum which may serve to amuse our readers, and enliven these dry\r\ndetails a little. Why is an Oyster the most anomalous, that is strange,\r\ncontradictory, creature in existence? Do you give it up? Well then it is\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n    “It wears a beard without any chin,\r\n    And leaves its bed to be tucked in.”\r\n\r\nAgain, by this allusion to the “tucking in” of Oysters, a phrase more\r\nexpressive than polite, we have recalled to memory the saying of a quaint\r\nold author, that they are “ungodly, uncharitable, and unprofitable meat;\r\nungodly, because they are eaten without grace; uncharitable, because they\r\nleave nothing but shells, and unprofitable because they must swim in\r\nwine.” Not, generally, however, are they eaten in this luxurious manner,\r\na little pepper and vinegar is all they commonly get in the way of sauce,\r\nand those who swallow them thus accompanied, seem to do so with infinite\r\nrelish. A very long chapter, if not a whole book, might be written about\r\nthe historical associations of Oysters, for which our country has been\r\nfamous, as far back as the time of the first Roman invasion; much, too,\r\nmight be said about the Oyster beds and fisheries, which give employment\r\nto thousands of our industrious population, but all this has so little\r\nto do with natural history, that we can find no excuse for dwelling upon\r\nit here. It is quite within the range of our subject, however, to state\r\nthat the “spat” or “spawn” of the Oyster is cast about the beginning of\r\nMay: at first it resembles a drop of greenish tallow, but by the aid of\r\nthe microscope it may be seen to consist of a great number of minute\r\nparticles, each of which is an egg, and will by-and-by become a perfect\r\nfish; these increase in size very rapidly, and after floating about for\r\na while, sink to the bottom, and become attached to rock or some other\r\nsubstance, in which position, if not violently detached or removed, they\r\ncomplete their growth, and live out the term of their natural life. Their\r\nfood is minute animalculæ, and microscopic vegetation, on the nature of\r\nwhich their flavour greatly depends.\r\n\r\nThey have many enemies besides man; the whelk, and the crab, the\r\nsea-star, or “five fingers,” and the large drum-fish, which swallows\r\nthem almost by the bushel, shells and all; these help to thin the\r\nOyster-beds, and make the dredger’s labours less remunerative than\r\nthey would otherwise be. Here is a picture of one as he stands in his\r\nboat just about to throw his dredge into the sandy bottom, where he\r\nknows the delicious testaceans do, or ought to, lie most thickly. The\r\ndredge, which is a triangular iron frame with a net over the bottom,\r\nwill naturally sink, and when the line to which it is attached ceases\r\nto run out, the dredger will put his boat in motion, and draw it thus\r\nover the Oyster-bed, and then pull it up filled, it may be, with little\r\nfat “Miltons,” or large “Colchesters,” or such other kind as the spot is\r\nknown to yield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Latin for Oyster is _Ostrea_, and that is a name given to a genus\r\nof the _Pectinidæ_ family, comprising beside the _O. edulis_, or Common\r\nOyster, many other species. _Edulis_ means eatable. Home naturalists\r\ndivide these Ostraceans into two groups, first with simple or undulated,\r\nbut not plaited valves; second, those which have the borders of their\r\nvalves distinctly plaited.\r\n\r\nTo the first group belong the Common Oyster, and between thirty and forty\r\nother living species which are found principally in warm and temperate\r\nlatitudes. In the Polar ocean none have been discovered, and in the\r\nhotter climates they are most abundant, being found in large beds or\r\nbanks near the coast, and often attached to rocks and even to trees which\r\ngrow by the water, so that the accounts of some old travellers who stated\r\nthat they saw Oysters growing upon trees, were not so false as many\r\nsupposed them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure is that of the Cock’s-comb Oyster, _Ostrea\r\nCrista-Galli_, a native of the Indian Seas, and a very remarkable shell,\r\non account of its crooked or deeply indented form; the specific name\r\nmeans cock’s-crest. The Chinese Window Oyster, called _Placuna Placenta_,\r\nwhich we may, if we like, translate into a pleasant or agreeable cake;\r\nthe shell, it will be seen, is round like a cake, and its smoothness\r\nand regularity of form render it agreeable to look upon; this species\r\ntoo comes from the Indian Seas, where it is taken on sandy bottoms. The\r\nAmerican Spiny Oyster, or _Spondylus Americanus_, brings us into another\r\nfamily, that of the Water Clams, called by naturalists _Spondylidæ_; with\r\nthe spines stuck out every way, and no way in particular, it looks like a\r\nhead of hair greatly in need of the assistance of one of its _pectinated_\r\nrelatives. The specific name of this curious shell explains itself; the\r\ngeneric name comes from the Latin _Spondylis_—a kind of serpent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPassing over the family _Malleidæ_, or Hammer Oysters, we come to the\r\n_Meleagrinidæ_, or Pearl Oysters, of which Fig. 1, Plate VIII, is an\r\nexample, this is the _M. Margaritifera_ of naturalists, the mollusk\r\nin whose shells pearls are chiefly found. Here are two long words;\r\n_Meleagris_ is the Latin for a Guinea or Turkey Hen, to the markings of\r\nwhose plumage naturalists might have imagined the shells of this genus\r\nbore some resemblance. There was, says the mythology, a celebrated hero\r\nof antiquity named Meleaga, but we can hardly suppose that there is any\r\nassociation between his name and that of a genus of Oysters, of which\r\nedible we read the ancients were very fond, and they are said to have had\r\na fancy not only for the mollusk itself, but also for the pearls found\r\nin its shell, which at their luxurious banquets they dissolved in wine,\r\nto make the draughts richer, or at all events more expensive; and this\r\nbrings us to the specific name of the Pearl Oyster, _Margaritifera_,\r\nwhich comes from the Latin _Margarita_—a pearl; the French use this word\r\nslightly altered in the spelling, thus _Marguerite_ for both a daisy, and\r\n\r\n\r\nA PEARL.\r\n\r\nThis jewel, so highly valued for its chaste beauty, is but a secretion of\r\nanimal matter, resulting from the efforts of some uneasy mollusk, annoyed\r\nby a foreign substance, which has found its way into his habitation, to\r\nmake the best of an unavoidable evil by enclosing it in a soft smooth\r\ncovering. Let us imitate the Oyster, and when annoyed or afflicted,\r\nby meekness and patience, and christian charity, strive to turn our\r\nvexations and troubles into “pearls of great price,” and “goodly pearls,”\r\nlike those mentioned in scripture.\r\n\r\nIt is on the north-west coast of the Island of Ceylon, in the Indian\r\nOcean, that the Pearl Oyster most abounds, and there it is that the Pearl\r\nfishery is conducted in the most extensive, systematic, and successful\r\nmanner; this fishing commences at the beginning of March, and upwards\r\nof two hundred boats are usually employed in it; in each of these boats\r\nare ten divers, who go down to the Oyster-beds, five at a time, and so\r\nrelieve each other; there are besides thirteen other men who manage the\r\nboat, and attend to the divers. Altogether it is computed that from\r\nfifty to sixty thousand persons, in some way engaged in the fishery,\r\nor preparation, or sale of the pearls, assemble at and near the scene\r\nof operations, which must be indeed a busy one. The number of Oysters\r\ntaken during the period of the fishing, which is about a month, must be\r\nprodigious. One boat has been known to bring on shore, in the day, as\r\nmany as thirty-three thousand; they are placed in heaps, and allowed\r\nto remain until they become putrid, when they undergo a very elaborate\r\nprocess of washing and separating from the shells, which are carefully\r\nexamined and deprived of their pearly treasures. The stench arising from\r\nthe decomposed animal matter is described as horrible, and the whole\r\nprocess filthy and loathsome in the extreme; yet out of the slime and\r\nmud and disgusting effluvia, come every year gems of inestimable value,\r\ncalculated to adorn the brow of beauty, and form ornaments the most pure\r\nand delicate that can be imagined. For the exclusive right of fishing\r\non the banks of Ceylon, for a single season, as much as £120,000 have\r\nbeen paid to the English government by one person, who sublets boats to\r\nothers. Pearls vary greatly in value according to their colour and size;\r\nthose which are perfectly white are the most valuable; next to these\r\nare those which have a yellowish tinge; the smallest kind, used for\r\nvarious ornamental purposes, are called seed pearls, the refuse is made\r\ninto a kind of confection called _chimum_, highly relished by Chinese\r\nepicures. A single Oyster will sometimes contain several pearls, which\r\nare generally embedded in the body of the animal, but are sometimes fixed\r\nto the shell; it is recorded of one rich mollusk, that there were found\r\nin his possession no less than one hundred and fifty precious jewels; he\r\nmust have been a miser, or perhaps he had taken them in pledge from his\r\nless provident neighbours.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest time, pearls have been considered as valuable\r\nornaments; they are mentioned in the book of Job, (see chap. xxviii,\r\nverse 18th.,) and are often alluded to by Greek and Roman writers.\r\nVarious attempts have been made to imitate them, and one mode of\r\nproducing them, practised, it is said, more than a thousand years ago,\r\nis still carried on in China. In the shells of Pearl Oysters, holes are\r\nbored, into which pieces of iron are introduced; these wounding and\r\nirritating the animal, cause it to deposit coat upon coat of pearly\r\nmatter over the wounded part, and so the pearl is formed. Artificial\r\npearls are made of hollow glass globules or little globes, covered on\r\nthe inside with a liquid called pearl-essence, and filled up with white\r\nwax. Historians speak of an ancient traffic in native pearls carried on\r\nby this country; and in modern times, British pearls of considerable\r\nvalue have been discovered, one not many years since, by a gentleman who\r\nwas eating oysters at Winchester, was valued at two hundred guineas.\r\nGenerally, however, the pearls of this country are inferior in the two\r\nrequisites of colour and size.\r\n\r\nInteresting accounts of Pearls and Pearl-fishing, will be found in “the\r\nPenny,” and “Saturday Magazines,” and many other works easy of access.\r\nThere our young readers may learn of the perils and dangers to which the\r\npoor divers are exposed from the voracious sharks, which hover about the\r\nfishing grounds, and make a dash at their victim, heedless of the written\r\ncharms, with which the priest or shark-charmer has provided him previous\r\nto his descent, and of much more than we can find space here to tell. All\r\nwe can now do is to give the portrait, as drawn by Thomas Hood, of a lady\r\nwho takes up her abode in all the pearl-producing bivalves, and who is\r\ntherefore, perhaps on this account, called\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOTHER OF PEARL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSSEL AND THE COCKLE.\r\n\r\nIt is in the _Dimyaria_ division of the _Conchifera_ that we must\r\nlook for these familiar bivalves, the Mussel, or, as it is sometimes\r\nspelled, Muscle, and the Cockle; the former called in scientific language\r\n_Mytilus_, which in Latin means simply a shell-fish, and the latter\r\n_Cardium_, which may have reference to the hinge of this bivalve, or\r\nthe heart-shape assumed by several of the species; _cardo_, in Latin,\r\nsignifying the hinge of a gate, and _cardesco_, a stone in the shape of a\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIt is to the _Mytilidæ_ family that we shall first direct our attention,\r\nand here we find the Common or Edible Mussel, (_M. edule_,) and many\r\nother species, in all of which the shell is more or less elongated,\r\nor lengthened out, and pointed at one end. The members of this family\r\nare abundant on most rocky coasts, where facilities are afforded for\r\nthe mollusks to moor themselves to rocks, stones, and other substances\r\ncovered at high-water, but left dry by the retreating tide. They are not,\r\nhowever, confined to shores of this description, but are sometimes found\r\nin vast numbers on low sandy or pebbly flats, which run far out into the\r\nsea; these are called beds of Mussels, and are, like the Oyster grounds,\r\nspecially cared for and protected. As a ship by its cable, so commonly\r\nthe Mussel, by its bissus or beard, is made fast to its anchorage-ground,\r\nbe it pebbly or sandy beach, or jutting rock. Sometimes, however, the\r\nmollusk travels, and this is how it manages to do so; it has a stout\r\nfleshy foot, in shape something like that of a chubby child, and this it\r\ncan advance about two inches beyond the edge of the shell, then fixing\r\nthe point of it to a piece of rock or any other body, and contracting it,\r\nthe shell is drawn onward, and sure, though slow, progress is made in any\r\ndesired direction. The _Pinna_, as the marine Mussel is called, has a\r\nfoot which is cylindrical in shape, and has at the bottom a round tendon,\r\nalmost as long as itself, the use of which appears to be to gather in\r\nand retain the numerous threads with which, when inhabiting the shores\r\nof tempestuous seas, it lashes itself fast to the fixed objects around;\r\nthese threads are fastened at various points, and then drawn tight by the\r\nanimal, whose instinct teaches it that its brittle shell would soon be\r\nbroken in pieces, if suffered to roll hither and thither at the mercy of\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nThe Mussel has a very curious method of preparing its cable for this\r\nservice; it is not woven, nor spun, nor drawn out of the body, like the\r\nweb of the spider, but produced in a liquid form, and cast in a mould\r\nwhich is formed by a groove in the foot, extending from the root of the\r\ntendon to the upper extremity; the sides of this groove are formed so\r\nas to fold over it and form a canal, into which the glutinous or sticky\r\nsecretion is poured; there it remains until it has dried into a solid\r\nthread, when the end of it is carried out by the foot, and applied to the\r\nobject to which it is to be attached; the canal is then opened through\r\nits whole length to free the thread, and closing again is ready for\r\nanother casting; as if conscious how much depends upon the security of\r\nhis lines, the animal tries every one after he has fixed it by swinging\r\nitself round so as to put the threads fully on the stretch; when once\r\nthey are all firmly fixed, it seems to have no power of disengaging\r\nitself from them; the liquid matter out of which they are formed, is\r\nso very glutinous, or glue-like, as to attach itself firmly to the\r\nsmoothest bodies. The process of producing it is a slow one, as it does\r\nnot appear that the _Pinna_ can form more than four or five in the course\r\nof twenty-four hours. When the animal is disturbed in its operations, it\r\nsometimes forms these threads too hastily; they are then more slender\r\nthan those produced at leisure, and, of a consequence, weaker. On some\r\nparts of the Mediterranean coast, as in Sicily, gloves and other articles\r\nhave been manufactured from the threads of this mollusk; they resemble\r\nvery fine silk in appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe foot of the Cockle, of which we here give a figure, is commonly\r\nemployed in scooping out the mud or sand, beneath which it conceals\r\nitself; this useful limb assumes the form of a shovel, hook, or any other\r\ninstrument necessary for the purpose; it appears to be a mass of muscular\r\nfibres, and to possess great power. As a boatman in shallow water sends\r\nhis vessel along by pushing against the bottom with his boat-hook,\r\nprecisely so does _Mr. Cardium_ travel; he doubles up his foot into a\r\nclub, and by an energetic use of it as a propeller, makes considerable\r\nheadway along the surface of the soft sand beneath the waters. In this\r\nway, too, some members of the genus _solen_ force their way through the\r\nsand; while those called _Tellina_ spring to a considerable distance, by\r\nfirst folding the foot into a small compass, and then suddenly expanding\r\nit, closing the shell at the same time with a loud snap; so that you see\r\nthese sober-looking mollusks are sometimes frolicksome fellows; this is\r\nan enforcement of the lesson, judge not by appearances.\r\n\r\nSome of the species, both of the Mussel and Cockle families, have very\r\nbeautiful shells. We give a representation of one of each, on Plate VIII.\r\nFig. 2 is the Magellanic Mytilus, (_M. Magellanicus_,) found chiefly\r\nin the Straits of Magellan; it is generally four or five inches long,\r\nthe shells when polished are very brilliant, the deep purple colour\r\nchanging into rich violet, as they are held in different lights. In most\r\ncabinets the large fan-like delicate shells of the genus _Pinna_ may be\r\nobserved; the largest species is that called _Pinna flabellum_, taken in\r\nthe Mediterranean; it sometimes exceeds two feet in length. The first of\r\nthese names is a Latin word signifying, besides a shell-fish, the fin of\r\na fish, or the wing feathers of a bird—hence the term pinion; it refers\r\nto the fin-like or wing-like shape of this shell. _Flabellum_ means a\r\nfan, referring probably to the bissus of the mollusk, which is fine and\r\nglossy, like silk, and very abundant.\r\n\r\nMany pretty specimens for figuring might be selected from the _Naidæ_,\r\na family of Fresh-water Mussels, so called from the Naiades, fabulous\r\ndivinities of the streams and rivers. The shells of many of these, which\r\nare of considerable thickness, are lined with the most brilliant nacre,\r\nand in these, as might be expected, pearls are sometimes found. One\r\nspecies, abundant in some English rivers, called the _Mya Margaritifera_,\r\nor, as some say, _Uno elongates_, has long been celebrated for this\r\nvaluable production. It was most likely with pearls from this mollusk\r\nthat Julius Cæsar adorned a breast-plate, which he dedicated to Venus,\r\nand hung up in her temple. The rivers Esk and Conway were formerly\r\ncelebrated as British pearl-fishing grounds; a Conway pearl was presented\r\nby her chamberlain, Sir Richard Wynn, of Gwyder, to Catharine, Queen\r\nof Charles the Second; and in the royal crown of Britain this jewel is\r\nsaid still to occupy a place. Sir John Hawkins, the circumnavigator of\r\nthe globe, held a patent for the pearl-fishery of the River Irt, in\r\nCumberland. The rivers of Tyrone and Donegal, in Ireland, have, or had,\r\ntheir pearl-bearing Mussels; we read of one which weighed thirty-six\r\ncarats, (a carat is nearly four grains,) but not being of perfect shape\r\nand colour, it was only valued at forty pounds. We also read of another\r\npurchased by Lady Glenlealy, for £10, and found to be so perfect and\r\nadmirable, that £80 was afterwards offered for it, and refused.\r\n\r\nThese _Naidæ_ have not a bissus like the Marine Mussels, they are\r\ntherefore never attached to one object; they use their foot as a\r\npropeller in traversing the muddy floor of the pond or river, and they\r\nhave a very funny way of getting along indeed; first, they open the\r\nvalves of the shell, put out the foot, and after some little hard work,\r\nmanage to set themselves up on edge; they then proceed by a series of\r\njerks, leaving a deepish furrow in the mud behind them.\r\n\r\nWe will now go to Fig. 3, the Spined Cytherea, the _Cytherea_ or _Venus\r\nDione_ of naturalists; the meaning of the term is the mother of Venus,\r\nwho was, as you will remember, the goddess of beauty, given to this shell\r\nperhaps because it is entitled to occupy a place at the head of the\r\n_Cytherea_, a genus of the _Cardiidæ_, or Cockle family, of which genus\r\nthere are about seventy-eight living species; this, as it is the most\r\nrare, is also, perhaps, the most beautiful; it is found in the seas of\r\nAmerica, and is remarkable for the row of spines on the hinder border of\r\neach valve; these vary much in size and number, being in some individuals\r\nlong and far apart, in others, short, thick, and closely set. The colour\r\nof the shell also varies considerably, being sometimes of a delicate\r\nrose colour; at others, more of a claret; at others again, bordering on\r\npurple. It was for one of the first discovered specimens of this shell,\r\nthat £1000 is said to have been given. Truly a Venus of value this; it\r\nought to be called the Queen of Cockles!\r\n\r\nOur next example, (see Fig. 4,) is the Spotted Tridacna, (_T.\r\nmaculatus_,) the latter term signifying spotted. In the _Chamidæ_ or Clam\r\nfamily, is placed the _Tridacna_ genus, the discovered species of which\r\nare not numerous; they are chiefly found in the Indian seas. The one\r\nabove mentioned claims pre-eminence for beauty. We cannot quite see the\r\napplicability of the generic name; _Tridacnus_, in Latin, signifies to\r\nbe eaten at three bites, but he must be a man of large capacity indeed\r\nwho could so devour the head of this family, the Giant Tradacna, (_T.\r\ngigas_,) a single specimen of which has been known to weigh as much as\r\nfive hundred and seventy pounds; from three to four hundred is by no\r\nmeans an uncommon size. The shell of this giant mollusk is of a very\r\npicturesque shape, something like its spotted _congener_, as we call\r\nanything of the same kind or genus, only it is somewhat plainer, and more\r\ndeeply ribbed and indented. The inside is of a glossy whiteness, and it\r\nis frequently used as a basin for garden fountains, or the reception of\r\nrills or little jets of water, which sparkle in its stainless hollow. In\r\nthe church of St. Salpice, at Paris, is a shell of this immense Clam, the\r\nvalves of which are used as receptacles for holy water; it was presented\r\nto Francis the First, by the republic of Venice. Fancy the clapping to of\r\nsuch a pair of valves, when the animal closes its shell in alarm, and the\r\nstrength of the cable required to moor it to the rocks or coral reef. The\r\nspotted species here figured has a solid and heavy shell, very elegantly\r\nshaped, and beautifully marked, as will be seen; the greatly reduced size\r\nof the figure prevents anything like justice being done to the original.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above is a figure of the Heart Isocardea, (_I. cor_,) which is also\r\na member of the Clam family, and one of the most elegantly-shaped shells\r\nin the whole range of Conchology. It is a native of the Mediterranean\r\nand other seas of Europe, and has been taken in deep water on the West\r\ncoast of Ireland. We complete this group with a representation of the\r\ncurious _Arcadæ_ family, or Ark shells, as they are commonly called,\r\nbecause one of the species was thought to resemble the ark built by Noah.\r\nMr. Swainson tells us that the animals of these shells affix themselves\r\nto other bodies by a particular muscle, which is protruded through the\r\ngaping part of the valves; they also adhere, when young, by means of\r\nthe bissiform epidermis, or bissus-like outer skin: this species is a\r\nnative of the Atlantic Ocean and the seas of Europe. The Antique Ark,\r\n(_A. antiqua_,) is very like the Common Cockle, being of a white colour,\r\nand heart-shaped. We give below a representation of this shell, and also\r\nof the shell of the pretty little Pearly Trigonia, (_T. margaritacea_,)\r\nincluded in the _Arcadæ_ family; this is a rare species, found only in\r\nthe seas of New Holland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALLOP SHELLS.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Scallop Shells are found scattered about on our\r\nshores; they belong, as before stated, to the family _Pectinidæ_, the\r\nmeaning of which term has been already explained. These shells were\r\ncalled by Cuvier “the Butterflies of the Ocean,” on account of the\r\nvarious and beautiful colours which they exhibit. Some of them are\r\nexceedingly thin, and brittle as glass; one species found in the Arctic\r\nregions, is as transparent as that substance, and is therefore called\r\n_P. vitreus_, from the Latin for glass, which is _vitreum_. One of\r\nthe commonest of our native Scallops is the St. James’ Cockle, (_P.\r\nJacobœus_;) this shell is found in great plenty along our southern\r\ncoasts; it is often referred to by old writers, on account of having\r\nbeen commonly worn in the hats of pilgrims to Palestine, or the Holy\r\nLand, as the scene of our Saviour’s life and death was called. Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, in his poem called “The Pilgrimage,” thus enumerates the\r\ndifferent articles considered necessary for a Palmer, as these pilgrims\r\nwere termed:—\r\n\r\n    “Give me my _scallop shell_ of quiet,\r\n      My _staff_ of faith to lean upon,\r\n    My _scrip_ of joy, (immortal diet,)\r\n      My _bottle_ of salvation,\r\n    My _gown_ of glory, hope’s true gage,\r\n    And thus I’ll make my pilgrimage.”\r\n\r\nThis Mollusk, it may be noticed, like many other bivalves, has a flat,\r\nand a concave or hollow shell: in early times when plates and drinking\r\nvessels were not so plentiful as they are now, one of these served the\r\nformer purpose, and the other the latter; thus, in speaking of a feast, a\r\nGaelic or Scottish bard has said—\r\n\r\n    “The joy of the _shell_ went round.”\r\n\r\nSometimes the species termed _Pecten opercularis_, was used as the\r\npilgrim’s badge; the specific name comes most likely from the Latin\r\n_operculum_, whose meaning has been explained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMON SCALLOP.]\r\n\r\nThis too, is a common British shell, as is also the little speckled\r\nScallop, (_P. varia_,) which may be found on almost any part of the coast\r\nwhere the water-line is margined with a sandy ridge. The shells are\r\ngenerally about two inches long, of various colours, clouded, speckled,\r\nand marked with about twelve ribs. There is a foreign species called\r\nthe Flounder Scallop, _P. pleuronectes_, which is remarkable for having\r\nthe two valves of the shell of different colours, the upper one being\r\nof a rich reddish brown, and the lower one white: the specific name has\r\nreference to this, being compounded of the Latin _pleura_—something\r\ndouble, and _necto_—to join. The fish called the Flounder, is brown above\r\nand white beneath, hence the English name of this shell. The preceding\r\nengraving of the Common Scallop, viewed from the front, shows the flat\r\nand concave form of the two valves of this shell, and also the depth of\r\nthe indentations or ridges.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMPITS.\r\n\r\nAmong the rocks of the British coast, there are no shells more frequently\r\nmet with than those of the Common Limpit, _Patella vulgata_; they lie\r\nscattered about like so many little empty cups, each having, on the\r\ndeath of the mollusk, fallen from the rocky cavity in which it was\r\nembedded, and which was just large enough to contain it. Here the animal\r\nattaches itself so firmly by its fibrous foot, which is hollow in the\r\ncentre, and acts like a sucker, that it is almost impossible to loosen\r\nits hold otherwise than by inserting something thin, like the blade\r\nof a knife between it and the stone. By this power of adhesion, the\r\nLimpit is protected from the violence of the waves, and also from its\r\nnumerous enemies, aquatic birds and animals, which have a relish for\r\nits flesh. Still vast numbers are used as food, both by man and the\r\ninferior creatures, so that the means of defence furnished to the Limpits\r\nof the rock, are not always sure. “The peasantry of the western isles\r\nof Scotland,” we are told by Miss Pratt, “look to the Periwinkles and\r\nLimpits, which abound on the rocks, for their daily meal, often for long\r\nseasons, subsisting almost entirely upon this humble food. In the Isle\r\nof Skye, the inhabitants are often, at one time of the year, without any\r\nother source of provision.” Then comes the Sea-gull, and the Duck, and\r\nthe Pied Oyster-catcher, to feed on the poor little mollusk, the bill of\r\nthe latter bird being admirably adapted for loosening its hold on the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n_Patella_ in Latin signifies a salad-dish, a knee-pan, and several other\r\ndomestic utensils, of a broad shallow make, and hence we find the plural\r\nform of the word applied to the Limpit family, whose shells are of such a\r\nshape. Members of this family are found on all rocky coasts, except those\r\nof the Arctic seas; on Tropical rocks they grow to a large size, and form\r\na valuable article of food. A very curious piece of mechanism is the\r\ntongue of the Common Limpit, it is from two to three inches long, and has\r\na spoon-like extremity, so that it looks, when extended from the mouth,\r\nlike a small snake; if examined through a microscope, it is seen to be\r\narmed throughout its whole extent with rows, four deep, of sharp hooked\r\nteeth, and between each row are placed two others, which have three\r\npoints, and are set in a slanting position; the use of this arrangement\r\nwe cannot at present determine, but no doubt it has a perfect adaptation\r\nto the wants of the animal.\r\n\r\nThere are shell-fish called Key-hole Limpits, which belong to the genus\r\n_Fissurellidæ_, from _fissura_—a cleft or slip, from whence comes also\r\nfissure. All the members of this genus are distinguished by the aperture\r\nat the top of the shell, shaped like a key-hole, which is situated\r\nexactly over the breathing organs, and serves as a channel for the water\r\nnecessary for respiration.\r\n\r\nFrequently upon the fronds of the large olive sea-weeds may be found a\r\ntiny shell shaped something like that of the Common Limpit; it is of an\r\nolive green colour, with blue streaks, and is called, from its clearness,\r\nthe Pellucid Limpit, _P. pellucida_. There is also another much like\r\nit in appearance, which naturalists call _P. lœvis_. To the labours of\r\nthese little mollusks, according to Dr. Harvey, may be partly attributed\r\nthe destruction of the gigantic Algæ, (sea-weed.) Eating into the lower\r\npart of the stems, and destroying the branches of the roots, they so far\r\nweaken the base, that it becomes unable to support the weight of the\r\nfrond; and thus the plant is detached and driven on shore by the waves.\r\n\r\n    “And so the forest tall that groweth,\r\n      Underneath the waters clear,\r\n    Does the little woodman mollusk,\r\n      Level every year;\r\n    From small causes, great results—\r\n      Teaching you to persevere.”\r\n\r\n\r\nROCK-BORERS.\r\n\r\nThe family _Pholadæ_ comprises a group of mollusks, the boring habits\r\nof which have long been known; they penetrate wood, hard clay, chalk,\r\nand rocks, and devastate the labours of man; they attack the hulls of\r\nships, the piles which form the foundations of piers and break-waters,\r\nand they force themselves upon our attention by the loss of property, as\r\nwell as of life, which results from their hidden depredations. Of this\r\nfamily, those belonging to the genus _Pholus_ may be more especially\r\nlikened to the Edomites of Scripture, because they take up their abode\r\nin the rock, and hollow out for themselves dwellings therein. With a\r\nshell as thin as paper, and brittle as glass, the wonder is how these\r\nRock-borers work their way into and through hard stones. Some naturalists\r\nassert that they effect this by means of an acid which decomposes the\r\nsubstance of the rock, and renders it soft; others, that the animal\r\nkeeps turning round and round like an instrument called an auger, and\r\nso gradually rasps away the surface of the stone with the angles of its\r\nshell, but we question whether the shell would not be worn out first in\r\nsuch a process. The generic name of these “stone-piercers,” comes from\r\nthe Greek word _Pholeo_—to hide, and the rocky chambers which they hollow\r\nout for themselves, are as snug hiding-places as can well be imagined;\r\nyet, however deep they may go into these gloomy caverns, as we should be\r\napt to suppose them, they need not be in darkness, for it appears that\r\nthese Pholades emit a most remarkable light, whether phosphorescent or\r\nnot does not appear to be determined; so strong is it, that it is said\r\nto illuminate the mouth of the person who eats the mollusk; and it is\r\nremarked by Dr. Priestly, that “contrary to the nature of most fish,\r\nwhich give light when they tend to putrescence, this is more luminous the\r\nfresher it is, and when dried its light will revive on being moistened\r\nwith water.” So that in more respects than one these rock-borers are\r\nmysteries. The most common of them, perhaps, is the Prickly Pidduck, or\r\nPeckstone, (_P. dactylus_,) which is much used by the fishermen of our\r\ncoasts as bait; the specific name is the Latin for a fruit shaped like\r\na finger, which is something like the shape of this mollusk, as will be\r\nseen by the annexed engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Pholus_ is very widely distributed, and all the species have\r\nthe same boring habits as those of our own coast, which we need not\r\nenumerate. Like them too in this respect are the marine worms called\r\n_Teredo_, which make their way into the bottoms of ships, and all\r\nsubmerged timber, but these will be more fully spoken of in another\r\nvolume. The above figure exhibits the _Pholas dactylus_ as it appears in\r\na section of rock, split open for the purpose of seeing the shelly miner\r\nat his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMULTIVALVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have insensibly passed from the Bivalve shells to those composed of\r\nseveral pieces, and therefore called Multivalves; properly, perhaps, the\r\nRock-borers, last described, come into this division, for although their\r\ncovering consists mainly of two principal portions or valves, yet there\r\nare often additional parts; in some a calcarious tube envelopes the whole\r\nmollusk, leaving only an opening behind; this is more especially the case\r\nwith those which most resemble worms, such as the genera _Teredina_ and\r\n_Teredo_, included by Lamarck in the family which he calls _Tubulidæ_.\r\n\r\nThe first group of multivalves we shall have to notice, are\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHITONS,\r\n\r\nforming the family _Chitonidæ_. The term has a Greek derivation, and\r\nmeans a coat of mail. These mollusks are covered by a shell formed of\r\neight distinct portions, arranged along the back in a single row, and\r\nattached to a mantle which resembles leather, being very tough and\r\nwrinkled; the edges of this mantle extend beyond the borders of the\r\nplates, which overlap each other, so as to constitute a kind of armour,\r\nvery different from the conical shell of the Limpit, or the turbinated,\r\nthat is twisted, case of some of the Borers. The coverings of the Chitons\r\nare variously marked, so that each distinct species is known by its\r\npeculiar pattern, as a knight of old by the quarterings of his shield.\r\nAll the mantles, however, have scaly, hairy, or spiny margins. In this\r\ncoat of mail, the animal can roll itself up like an armadillo, and so\r\nbe tolerably secure from its enemies; it has an oval foot, the sides\r\nof which are covered with small leaflets, and by means of this it can\r\nattach itself to rocks, like the Limpit, or travel about in search of\r\nadventures. It has no distinct head, therefore it is _acephalous_; nor\r\nany perceptible eyes. The mouth is furnished with a long tongue, curled\r\nup spirally, like a watch-spring, and armed with horny teeth.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Chiton family are numerous, being found on most rocky\r\nshores; they attain the largest size in the hottest climates, having\r\nnever been found very far north. The British species are small, and not\r\nmore than two or three in number; they may be found adhering to stones\r\nnear low-water mark. We give a figure of one of these called the Tufted\r\nChiton, (_C. fascicularis_;) this word is from the Latin _fasciculus_—a\r\nlittle bundle of leaves or flowers, and it refers to the hairy tufts that\r\nedge the mantle of this marine slug.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNACLES,\r\n\r\nOr, as they are sometimes called, Bernicles, belong to what naturalists\r\nterm the class _Cirrhopoda_, sometimes spelled _cirripeda_, which appears\r\nto be derived from the Latin _cirrus_—a tuft or lock of hair curled,\r\nand _pede_—a foot; hence the term may be translated hairy-footed. Such\r\nof our readers as have seen the Common or Duck Barnacle, (_Pentalasmis\r\nanatifera_,) will at once understand the applicability of this term. Many\r\na piece of drift wood comes to land literally covered with long fleshy\r\nstalks, generally of a purplish red colour, twisting and curling in all\r\ndirections, and terminating in delicate porcelain-like shells, clear and\r\nbrittle, of a white colour, just tinged with blue, from between which\r\nproject the many-jointed _cirrhi_, or hair-like tentacles, which serve\r\nthe purpose of a casting net, to seize and drag to the mouth of the\r\nanimal, its prey, which consists of small mollusks and crustacea.\r\n\r\nThis is the Barnacle about which such strange stories are told by old\r\nwriters, who affirmed that the Barnacle or Brent Goose, that in winter\r\nvisits our shores, is produced from these fleshy foot-stalks and hairy\r\nshells by a natural process of growth, or, as some philosophers of our\r\nday would say, of development. Gerard, who, in 1597, wrote a “Historie\r\nof Plants,” describes the process by which the fish is transformed into\r\nthe bird; telling his readers that as “the shells gape, the legs hang\r\nout, that the bird growing bigger and bigger the shells open more and\r\nmore, till at length it is attached only by the bill, soon after which it\r\ndrops into the sea; there it acquires feathers, and grows to a fowle.”\r\nThere is an amusing illustration given in Gerard’s book, where the young\r\nGeese are represented hanging on the branches of trees, just ready to\r\ndrop into the water, where a number of those that have previously fallen,\r\nlike ripe fruit, and attained their full plumage, are sailing about\r\nvery contentedly. It was part of this theory that the Barnacles were of\r\nvegetable origin, they grew upon trees, or sprung out of the ground like\r\nmushrooms; so we find in the works of an old poet named Du Bartas, these\r\nlines:—\r\n\r\n    “So slow Bootes underneath him sees\r\n    In the icy islands goslings hatched of trees,\r\n    Whose fruitful leaves, falling into the water,\r\n    Are turned, as known, to living fowls soon after;\r\n    So rotten planks of broken ships do change\r\n    To Barnacles. O transformation strange!\r\n    ’Twas first a green tree, then a broken hull,\r\n    Lately a mushroom, now a flying Gull.”\r\n\r\nThe investigations of modern science have quite exploded this foolish\r\nnotion; we now know exactly what transformations the Barnacle undergoes;\r\nstrange enough some of them are, but it does not change into a Goose,\r\nalthough its specific name has reference to that bird, being derived from\r\n_anas_, the Latin for Goose.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the Barnacle is composed of five pieces joined together by\r\nmembranes; four pieces are lateral, that is to say, they form the sides,\r\nthe word comes from the Latin _latus_—a side; the other is a single\r\nnarrow slip, which fills what would otherwise be an open space down the\r\nback between the valves; these parts of the shell appear to be somewhat\r\nloosely connected, so as to allow free action to the animal lodged\r\nwithin, which is enclosed in a fine skin or mantle. The mouth is placed\r\nat the lower part, near the opening, whence the _cirrhi_ issue forth;\r\nthis mouth is a curious piece of mechanism, being furnished with a horny\r\nlip covered with minute _palpi_, or feelers; there are three pairs of\r\n_mandibles_, that is jaws, the two outer ones being horny and _serrated_,\r\nthat is jagged or toothed like a saw; the inner one is soft and\r\nmembranous, that is, composed of little fibres, like strings, crossing\r\neach other, as we see what are called the veins in a leaf.\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said about the internal structure of the Cirrhopods,\r\nor _Balani_, as the Barnacle group is sometimes called, from the Latin\r\n_Balanus_—a kind of acorn. By some naturalists, the term is not applied\r\nto the stalked _Cirrhipoda_, like that we have been describing, but only\r\nto the _sessile_ kinds, that is, those which set close or grow low; from\r\nthe same Latin root comes the English word _session_—a settling. The\r\ncoverings of these Dwarf Barnacles are sometimes called acorn shells;\r\nthey are commonly white, of an irregular cone shape, composed of several\r\nribbed pieces, closely fitted together with an opening at the top, closed\r\nby an _operculum_, or stopper.\r\n\r\nThese shells cover in patches the surface of exposed rocks, drift wood,\r\nand any other substance. Some of the mollusks affix themselves to the\r\nbodies of Whales, others form a lodgment in the hollows of corals and\r\nsponges. Once fixed they remain so during life, taking their chance of\r\nsuch suitable food as may come within their limited sphere of action.\r\nAt an earlier stage of their existence, both their shape and habits are\r\nvery different, being lively little creatures, swimming about hither and\r\nthither like water-fleas. They are about the tenth of an inch long, and\r\nof most grotesque appearance, having six jointed legs set with hairs,\r\nthe whole being so arranged that they act in concert, and striking or\r\nflapping the water, send the little body along in a series of bounds;\r\nthen the creature has two long arms, each furnished with hooks and a\r\nsucker, and a tail tipped with bristles, which is usually folded up under\r\nthe body; its pair of large staring eyes are _pedunculated_, that is, set\r\nupon foot-stalks; it has a house on its back, like a bivalve shell, into\r\nwhich it can collect its scattered members when occasion requires. When\r\nof sufficient age to settle itself in life, and become a staid member\r\nof submarine society, it fixes itself to some convenient object, throws\r\naway its eyes as no longer useful, gets rid of its preposterous limbs,\r\nenlarges its house, and sits down to fishing in a small way for an honest\r\nand respectable livelihood.\r\n\r\nA piece of timber covered with Stalked Barnacles, wriggling and twisting\r\nabout like so many helmeted snakes, and waving their plume-like _cirrhi_,\r\nis a very curious sight. They sometimes attach themselves to ship’s\r\nbottoms in such numbers as to retard their progress through the water;\r\nthey do not, however, bore into and destroy the timber, like the\r\n_Teredines_, or ship worms, to which we have alluded in our brief notice\r\nof the _Pholadæ_. The growth of Barnacles must be very rapid, as a ship\r\nperfectly free from them, will often return after a short voyage, with\r\nher bottom below the water line completely covered.\r\n\r\nWe give a representation of a group of these stalked mollusks, as they\r\nappear affixed to a piece of timber. This is the Common, or Duck Barnacle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTLE FISH.\r\n\r\nStrange and monstrous as are the forms of many of the creatures that\r\ninhabit the deep, there are perhaps none more so than those belonging\r\nto that division of the class _Cephalopoda_, called _Sepia_ or\r\nCuttle-fish. But before we go any further let us enquire what is meant by\r\na _Cephalopod_. Our readers have already learned that _Gasteropod_ means\r\nstomach and foot, and that _acephalous_ means headless; now here we have\r\na word which takes a portion of each of the others, _cephal_—head, and\r\n_peda_, or _poda_—a foot, consequently _ceph-a-lo-po-da_, is a class of\r\nmolluscous animals which have their feet, or organs of motion, arranged\r\naround the head, something, you may suppose, like that celebrated hero of\r\nnursery rhymes,\r\n\r\n    “Tom Toddy, all head and no body.”\r\n\r\nOnly our bag-shaped Mr. Sepia, with his great round staring eyes, and\r\nnumerous legs or arms, whichever you please to call them, all twisting\r\nand twining about like so many serpents, is a much more formidable\r\nlooking individual. A strange fellow is this altogether; he has a shell,\r\nbut he does not use it for a covering, he carries it inside of him, and\r\nit serves the purpose of a sort of back-bone; it is horny and calcarious,\r\nlight and porous, as our readers well know, having most likely often\r\nused it to take out unsightly blots, or erase mistakes in their copy or\r\ncyphering books.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Sepia walks abroad, he sticks his little round body upright,\r\nso that his eyes, and mouth, which is armed with a parrot-like beak,\r\nare brought close to the surface over which he passes, while his long\r\ntwining legs go sprawling about in all directions; on the insides of\r\nthese legs are a great number of small circular suckers, by means of\r\nwhich the animal can fix itself to any object so tightly that it is\r\nalmost impossible to detach it without tearing off part of the limb.\r\nWoe be to the poor unfortunate fish that chances to come in its way;\r\nthe snaky arms are thrown around it, and made fast, and away goes the\r\ncephalopod for a ride, eating on the road to lose no time, on the finny\r\nsteed that carries it. In some species each of the suckers has a hook in\r\nthe centre, which of course renders the hold yet firmer, and no doubt\r\nadds to the disagreeable sensation which their tight compression must\r\ncause; it is likely that these hooks are intended to retain the hold\r\nof soft and slippery prey, which might otherwise be too agile for the\r\n“ugly customer,” that would affectionately embrace it. But Mr. Sepia,\r\nthough well armed in front, is rather open to attacks in the rear of\r\nhis soft naked body; to provide for such an emergency, he is furnished\r\nwith a little bag of inky fluid, which he squirts out in the face of his\r\npursuer, and escapes under cover of the cloud; this is the substance used\r\nby painters, and called sepia, whence the generic name of the mollusks\r\nwhich produce it.\r\n\r\nIn the British seas none of these cephalopods attain so large a size as\r\nto be formidable to man, as they do in warmer climates. It was asserted\r\nby Dens, an old navigator, that in the African seas, while three of his\r\nmen were employed during a calm in scraping the sides of the vessel,\r\nthey were attacked by a monstrous Cuttle-fish, which seized them in its\r\narms, and drew two of them under water, the third man was with difficulty\r\nrescued by cutting off one of the creature’s limbs, which was as thick\r\nat the base as the fore-yard of the ship, and had suckers as large as\r\nladles; the rescued sailor was so horrified by the monster, that he died\r\ndelirious a few hours after. An account is also given of another crew who\r\nwere similarly attacked off the coast of Angola; the creature threw its\r\narms across the vessel, and had nearly succeeded in dragging it down, and\r\nwas only prevented doing so by the severing of its limbs with swords and\r\nhatchets. A diligent observer of nature has asserted that in the Indian\r\nseas Cuttle-fish are often seen two fathoms broad across the centre,\r\nwith arms nine fathoms long. Only think, what a monster! with a body\r\ntwelve feet across, and eight or ten legs like water-snakes, some six and\r\nthirty feet long. Well may it be said, that the Indians when they go out\r\nin boats are in dread of such, and never sail without an axe for their\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told by a gentleman named Beale, who, while searching\r\nfor shells upon the rocks of the Bonin Islands, encountered a species\r\nof Cuttle-fish called by the whalers “the Rock-squid,” and rashly\r\nendeavoured to secure it. This cephalopod, whose body was not bigger\r\nthan a large clenched hand, had tentacles at least four feet across,\r\nand having its retreat to the sea cut off by Mr. Beale, twined its\r\nlimbs around that gentleman’s arm, which was bared to the shoulder for\r\nthe purpose of thrusting into holes of the rocks after shells, and\r\nendeavoured to get its horny beak in a position for biting. The narrator\r\ndescribes the sickening sensation of horror which chilled his very blood,\r\nas he felt the creature’s cold slimy grasp, and saw its large staring\r\neyes fixed on him, and the beak opening and closing. He called loudly\r\nfor help, and was soon joined by his companion, who relieved him by\r\ndestroying the Cuttle-fish with a knife, and detaching the limbs piece by\r\npiece.\r\n\r\nThere are several species of these cephalopods; the most generally\r\ndistributed appears to be the _Octopus vulgaris_, or Common Cuttle-fish,\r\nwhich is sometimes found on our own shores, where also may be obtained\r\nthe Common Sepiola, _S. vulgaris_, usually about three inches long, and\r\nthe Officinal Cuttle-fish, _S. Officinalis_, which is about a foot in\r\nlength; we give below small figures of each of these three species, to\r\nshow the difference in the shape: the two last, it will be observed,\r\nhave, in addition to the eight tentacles, which give the generic name\r\n_Octopus_, signifying eight, two long side arms, the use of which does\r\nnot appear to be very clearly determined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O. VULGARIS. S. VULGARIS. S. OFFICINALIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUTILUS AND AMMONITE.\r\n\r\nThe Nautili are called testaceous cephalopods, our readers know, or ought\r\nto know, the meaning of both these terms. Like the Cuttle-fish they are\r\nsometimes called _Polypi_, because they have many arms or tentacles, the\r\nword _poly_, with which a great number of English words commence, being\r\nthe Greek for many. An ancient writer named Aristotle, after describing\r\nthe naked cephalopods, says, “There are also two polypi in shells; one\r\nis called by some, _nautilus_, and by others, _nauticus_. It is like the\r\npolypus, but its shell resembles a hollow comb or pecten, and is not\r\nattached. This polypus ordinarily feeds near the sea-shore; sometimes\r\nit is thrown by the waves on the dry land, and the shell falling from\r\nit, is caught, and there dies. The other is in a shell like a snail, and\r\nthis does not go out of its shell, but remains in it like a snail, and\r\nsometimes stretches forth its _cirrhi_.” The first of these animals,\r\nthere can be no doubt, is the Argonaut, or Paper Nautilus, and the latter\r\nthat which is called the True Nautilus, of both of which species let us\r\nsay a few words, which we will introduce by quoting some beautiful lines\r\nfrom a poem called “the Pelican Island,” by James Montgomery.\r\n\r\n    “Light as a flake of foam upon the wind,\r\n    Keel upwards from the deep, emerged a shell,\r\n    Shaped like the moon ere half her orb is filled:\r\n    Fraught with young life it righted as it rose,\r\n    And moved at will along the yielding water.\r\n    The native pilot of this little bark\r\n    Put out a tier of oars on either side;\r\n    Spread to the wafted breeze a two-fold sail,\r\n    And mounted up and glided down the billow,\r\n    In happy freedom, pleased to feel the air,\r\n    And wander in the luxury of light.”\r\n\r\nThe tiny mariner here alluded to, is the Paper Nautilus, common in the\r\nMediterranean and some tropical seas; its scientific name is _Argonauta\r\nargo_. In the mythology, we read that _Argo_ was the name of a ship\r\nthat carried a certain Grecian named Jason, and a crew of _argives_ in\r\nsearch of adventures; some say that the term is derived from a Greek word\r\nsignifying swift: this party of mariners, said to be the first that ever\r\nsailed upon the sea, was called _Argonauts_, or, as it might be freely\r\ntranslated, seamen of the ship Argo. _Nauticus_, in Latin, signifies\r\nanything relating to ships or navigation, and here you have the whole\r\norigin of the name of this little Argonaut, about which we must sing you\r\na song written by Mary Howitt, before we proceed further:—\r\n\r\n    “Who was the first sailor; tell me who can;\r\n      Old father Neptune?—no, you’re wrong,\r\n    There was another ere Neptune began;\r\n      Who was he? tell me. Tightly and strong,\r\n        Over the waters he went—he went,\r\n        Over the waters he went!\r\n\r\n    Who was the first sailor? tell me who can;\r\n      Old father Noah!—no, you’re wrong,\r\n    There was another ere Noah began,\r\n      Who was he? tell me. Tightly and strong,\r\n        Over the waters he went—he went,\r\n        Over the waters he went.\r\n\r\n    Who was the first sailor? tell me who can;\r\n      Old father Jason?—no, you’re wrong,\r\n    There was another ere Jason began,\r\n      Don’t be a blockhead, boy! Tightly and strong,\r\n        Over the waters he went—he went,\r\n        Over the waters he went.\r\n\r\n    Ha! ’tis nought but the poor little Nautilus—\r\n      Sailing away in his pearly shell;\r\n    He has no need of a compass like us,\r\n      Foul or fair weather he manages well!\r\n        Over the water he goes—he goes,\r\n        Over the water he goes.”\r\n\r\nMany more poems of the like nature we might quote, for this little\r\nshelled cephalopod has been a favourite with the poets time out of mind,\r\nand in some instances they and the less imaginative naturalists have\r\ndisagreed in their accounts of its form and operations, for instance,\r\nPope says—\r\n\r\n    “Learn of the little Nautilus to sail,\r\n    Spread the thin oar and catch the driving gale.”\r\n\r\n“Catch a fiddle-stick,” say some naturalists, the little Nautilus does\r\nnothing of the sort; and if you go to him to learn navigation, you will\r\nnever be much of a sailor; he may teach you how to sink to the bottom and\r\nrise again, and that kind of knowledge might be worth something to you\r\nif you could breathe under water; and he might teach you how to swim, but\r\nnot how to sail, for in spite of all poetic theories, he does the former\r\nand not the latter. Most usually he walks about at the bottom of the sea\r\non his long arms, something like the Cuttle-fish, feeding on the marine\r\nvegetation; the shell is then uppermost; if we could look inside of it we\r\nshould see numerous little chambers or cells, the larger and outermost\r\nof which only are inhabited by the mollusk, the others being filled with\r\nair render the whole light and buoyant. Through the centre of these\r\nchambers, down to the smallest of them, runs a membranous tube which can\r\nbe exhausted or filled with fluid at the pleasure of the animal, and\r\nthe difference thus effected in the weight of the shell enables it to\r\nsink or swim; in the latter case, up it goes to the surface, and “keel\r\nupwards from the deep,” emerges, as the poet has said, but once there it\r\nsoon reverses its position. The shell becomes like a boat it is true,\r\nbut its inhabitant neither points a sail nor plies the oar, but propels\r\nitself along stem foremost by a muscular action, which by alternately\r\ncompressing and loosening a kind of siphon, throws out jets or gushes of\r\nwater, which by the resistance they meet with from the surrounding fluid,\r\ngive the desired onward motion, and away the swimmer goes, his long arms\r\ngathered closely together, and streaming behind like the tail of a comet,\r\nand its round eyes keeping a sharp look-out on either side. Should it\r\nespy danger, the body and limbs are withdrawn into the shell, and the\r\nfluid driven through the central tube, so as to compress the air in the\r\npearly cells, and down sinks the swimmer once again to his native depths,\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n    “The floor is of sand like the mountain drift,\r\n      And the pearl shells’ spangle the flinty snow;\r\n    And from coral rocks the sea-plants lift\r\n      Their boughs where the tides and billows flow,\r\n      The water is calm and still below.\r\n    For the winds and waves are absent there;\r\n      And the sands are bright as the stars that glow\r\n    In the motionless fields of upper air.\r\n    And life in rare and beautiful forms,\r\n      Is sporting amid those bowers of stone,\r\n    And is safe, when the wrathful spirit of storms,\r\n      Has made the top of the waves his own.”\r\n\r\nWe give below two figures of the Argonaut, one of which represents him\r\ncrawling at the bottom of the sea, and the other swimming on the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe True, or Pearly Nautilus, (_N. Pompilius_,) the origin of whose\r\nspecific name we have been unable to discover, is much like the Argonaut\r\nin appearance and general construction; the shell is externally smoother\r\nand more iridescent, it is also generally somewhat thicker than the\r\nformer kind, and has internally more chambers or divisions; its pearly\r\nlustre renders it a beautiful ornament, and the large size it frequently\r\nattains a very conspicuous one. Its inhabitant has several peculiarities\r\nof organization, which distinguish it from the Argonauts, but into these\r\nwe need not enter; neither can we pause to describe the other species\r\nof nautili, the shells of which, like those of the Cowry and other\r\nunivalves, are covered with a membrane which hides their beauty. This\r\nmembrane or mantle sometimes extends some distance beyond the edge of\r\nthe shell, and, being of a light and filmy appearance, may have been\r\nmistaken for a sail hoisted by the creature to catch the breeze, while\r\nits long arms, thrust up into the air or down into the water, may have\r\nbeen thought to be masts or oars, so that the poets are not so much to be\r\nblamed, if they say as Wordsworth does.\r\n\r\n    “Spread, tiny Nautilus, the living sail,\r\n    Dive at thy choice, or catch the freshening gale.”\r\n\r\nNearly allied to the Nautili are these beautiful fossil shells called\r\nAmmonites, from their fancied resemblance to the horns of a heathen deity\r\nor god, called Jupiter Ammon. These shells, at once the wonder and pride\r\nof geologists, are found in the chalk formations, and thousands of years\r\nmust have passed away since they were inhabited by living creatures.\r\nThe Nautili which swam and sported with them at the depths of the ocean,\r\nas is proved by the shells of many species found in the same chalky\r\ndeposits, have still their living representatives, but those winding\r\ngalleries and pearly chambers once fragile as paper and brittle as glass,\r\nnow turned into, and surrounded by solid stone, are all shells of extinct\r\nspecies, and we can hardly see and handle them without some degree of\r\nawe and reverence; when we reflect on the great and wonderful changes\r\nthat have passed over the earth since they were formed by a hand divine,\r\ninstinct with the breath of life, and then to be embedded in the rock\r\nas everlasting characters by which the unborn generations of men might\r\nread in history of those changes, and of the providential dealings of God\r\nwith his creatures. Of these Ammonites, and other fossil shells, much\r\nmore will have to be said in our proposed geological volume; the poem\r\nwhich follows will very appropriately conclude the above remarks, and\r\nour present little work on shells—beautiful, wonderful shells! useful,\r\nornamental, instructive! The subject is one which we would earnestly\r\ninvite our young readers to study: it is but here introduced; we have\r\npicked up a few, very few, of the wonders and beauties of conchology, and\r\npresented them to their notice in the hope that they may be induced to\r\ndesire a more intimate acquaintance with this branch of natural science,\r\nwhich has been hitherto greatly neglected. To understand it thoroughly,\r\nmuch attention and perseverance will be required, but even a slight\r\nacquaintance with it will yield both pleasure and profit to the mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAUTILUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMMONITE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAUTILUS AND THE AMMONITE.\r\n\r\n    The Nautilus and the Ammonite,\r\n      Were launched in storm and strife;\r\n    Each sent to float in its tiny boat,\r\n      On the wide, wild sea of life.\r\n\r\n    And each could swim on the ocean’s brim,\r\n      And anon its sails could furl,\r\n    And sink to sleep in the great sea deep,\r\n      In a palace all of pearl.\r\n\r\n    And their’s was a bliss more fair than this,\r\n      That we feel in our colder time;\r\n    For they were rife in a tropic life,\r\n      In a brighter, happier clime.\r\n\r\n    They swam ’mid isles whose summer smiles\r\n      No wintry winds annoy;\r\n    Whose groves were palm, whose air was balm,\r\n      Whose life was only joy.\r\n\r\n    They roam’d all day through creek and bay,\r\n      And travers’d the ocean deep;\r\n    And at night they sank on a coral bank,\r\n      In its fairy bowers to sleep.\r\n\r\n    And the monsters vast of ages past,\r\n      They beheld in their ocean caves;\r\n    And saw them ride in their power and pride,\r\n      And sink in their billowy graves.\r\n\r\n    Thus hand in hand, from strand to strand,\r\n      They sail’d in mirth and glee;\r\n    Those fairy shells, with their crystal cells,\r\n      Twin creatures of the sea.\r\n\r\n    But they came at last to a sea long past,\r\n      And as they reach’d its shore,\r\n    The Almighty’s breath spake out in death,\r\n      And the Ammonite liv’d no more.\r\n\r\n    And the Nautilus now in its shelly prow,\r\n      As o’er the deep it strays,\r\n    Still seems to seek in bay and creek,\r\n      Its companion of other days.\r\n\r\n    And thus do we, in life’s stormy sea,\r\n      As we roam from shore to shore;\r\n    While tempest-tost, seek the lov’d—the lost,\r\n      But find them on earth no more!\r\n\r\n                               G.
