The work presumes a standard of education\r\ncorresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and,\r\ndespite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force\r\nof will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himself no\r\npains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and\r\nmost intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and\r\nconnection in which they actually originated. In the interest of\r\nclearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself\r\nfrequently, without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of\r\nthe presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that\r\nbrilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom matters\r\nof elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler. I make\r\nno pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties which are\r\ninherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have purposely treated\r\nthe empirical physical foundations of the theory in a “step-motherly”\r\nfashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may not feel like the\r\nwanderer who was unable to see the forest for the trees. May the book\r\nbring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought!\r\n\r\nDecember, 1916\r\n\r\n A. EINSTEIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I: THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nPHYSICAL MEANING OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance\r\nwith the noble building of Euclid’s geometry, and you remember—perhaps\r\nwith more respect than love—the magnificent structure, on the lofty\r\nstaircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours by\r\nconscientious teachers. By reason of our past experience, you would\r\ncertainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the\r\nmost out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. But\r\nperhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if\r\nsome one were to ask you: “What, then, do you mean by the assertion\r\nthat these propositions are true?” Let us proceed to give this question\r\na little consideration.\r\n\r\nGeometry sets out from certain conceptions such as “plane,” “point,”\r\nand “straight line,” with which we are able to associate more or less\r\ndefinite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, in\r\nvirtue of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as “true.” Then, on\r\nthe basis of a logical process, the justification of which we feel\r\nourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to\r\nfollow from those axioms, _i.e._ they are proven. A proposition is then\r\ncorrect (“true”) when it has been derived in the recognised manner from\r\nthe axioms. The question of “truth” of the individual geometrical\r\npropositions is thus reduced to one of the “truth” of the axioms. Now\r\nit has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable\r\nby the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself entirely without\r\nmeaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line\r\ngoes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals\r\nwith things called “straight lines,” to each of which is ascribed the\r\nproperty of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. The\r\nconcept “true” does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry,\r\nbecause by the word “true” we are eventually in the habit of\r\ndesignating always the correspondence with a “real” object; geometry,\r\nhowever, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it\r\nto objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these\r\nideas among themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel\r\nconstrained to call the propositions of geometry “true.” Geometrical\r\nideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these\r\nlast are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those ideas.\r\nGeometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give to its\r\nstructure the largest possible logical unity. The practice, for\r\nexample, of seeing in a “distance” two marked positions on a\r\npractically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our habit\r\nof thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as being\r\nsituated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to\r\ncoincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice of our\r\nplace of observation.\r\n\r\nIf, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the\r\npropositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two\r\npoints on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same\r\ndistance (line-interval), independently of any changes in position to\r\nwhich we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry\r\nthen resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative\r\nposition of practically rigid bodies.[1] Geometry which has been\r\nsupplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics.\r\nWe can now legitimately ask as to the “truth” of geometrical\r\npropositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking\r\nwhether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have\r\nassociated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can\r\nexpress this by saying that by the “truth” of a geometrical proposition\r\nin this sense we understand its validity for a construction with rule\r\nand compasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] It follows that a natural object is associated also with a\r\n straight line. Three points _A, B_ and _C_ on a rigid body thus lie in\r\n a straight line when the points _A_ and _C_ being given, _B_ is chosen\r\n such that the sum of the distances _AB_ and _BC_ is as short as\r\n possible. This incomplete suggestion will suffice for the present\r\n purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the conviction of the “truth” of geometrical propositions in\r\nthis sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. For\r\nthe present we shall assume the “truth” of the geometrical\r\npropositions, then at a later stage (in the general theory of\r\nrelativity) we shall see that this “truth” is limited, and we shall\r\nconsider the extent of its limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nTHE SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has been\r\nindicated, we are also in a position to establish the distance between\r\ntwo points on a rigid body by means of measurements. For this purpose\r\nwe require a “distance” (rod _S_) which is to be used once and for all,\r\nand which we employ as a standard measure. If, now, _A_ and _B_ are two\r\npoints on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them\r\naccording to the rules of geometry; then, starting from _A_, we can\r\nmark off the distance _S_ time after time until we reach _B_. The\r\nnumber of these operations required is the numerical measure of the\r\ndistance _AB_. This is the basis of all measurement of length.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over _i.e._ that\r\n the measurement gives a whole number. This difficulty is got over by\r\n the use of divided measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not\r\n demand any fundamentally new method.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery description of the scene of an event or of the position of an\r\nobject in space is based on the specification of the point on a rigid\r\nbody (body of reference) with which that event or object coincides.\r\nThis applies not only to scientific description, but also to everyday\r\nlife. If I analyse the place specification “Trafalgar Square,\r\nLondon”[3] I arrive at the following result. The earth is the rigid\r\nbody to which the specification of place refers; “Trafalgar Square,\r\nLondon” is a well-defined point, to which a name has been assigned, and\r\nwith which the event coincides in space.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n [3]\r\n\r\nI have chosen this as being more familiar to the English reader than\r\nthe “Potzdammer Platz, Berlin,” which is referred to in the original.\r\n(R. W. L.)\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] It is not necessary here to investigate further the significance\r\n of the expression “coincidence in space.” This conception is\r\n sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are\r\n scarcely likely to arise as to its applicability in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis primitive method of place specification deals only with places on\r\nthe surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of\r\npoints on this surface which are distinguishable from each other. But\r\nwe can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering\r\nthe nature of our specification of position. If, for instance, a cloud\r\nis hovering over Trafalgar Square, then we can determine its position\r\nrelative to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly\r\non the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The length of the pole\r\nmeasured with the standard measuring-rod, combined with the\r\nspecification of the position of the foot of the pole, supplies us with\r\na complete place specification. On the basis of this illustration, we\r\nare able to see the manner in which a refinement of the conception of\r\nposition has been developed.\r\n\r\n(_a_) We imagine the rigid body, to which the place specification is\r\nreferred, supplemented in such a manner that the object whose position\r\nwe require is reached by the completed rigid body.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In locating the position of the object, we make use of a number\r\n(here the length of the pole measured with the measuring-rod) instead\r\nof designated points of reference.\r\n\r\n(_c_) We speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which\r\nreaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical\r\nobservations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and\r\ntaking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we\r\ndetermine the length of the pole we should have required in order to\r\nreach the cloud.\r\n\r\nFrom this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, in the\r\ndescription of position, it should be possible by means of numerical\r\nmeasures to make ourselves independent of the existence of marked\r\npositions (possessing names) on the rigid body of reference. In the\r\nphysics of measurement this is attained by the application of the\r\nCartesian system of co-ordinates.\r\n\r\nThis consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and\r\nrigidly attached to a rigid body. Referred to a system of co-ordinates,\r\nthe scene of any event will be determined (for the main part) by the\r\nspecification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars or\r\nco-ordinates (_x, y, z_) which can be dropped from the scene of the\r\nevent to those three plane surfaces. The lengths of these three\r\nperpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with\r\nrigid measuring-rods performed according to the rules and methods laid\r\ndown by Euclidean geometry.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of\r\nco-ordinates are generally not available; furthermore, the magnitudes\r\nof the co-ordinates are not actually determined by constructions with\r\nrigid rods, but by indirect means. If the results of physics and\r\nastronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of\r\nspecifications of position must always be sought in accordance with the\r\nabove considerations.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] A refinement and modification of these views does not become\r\n necessary until we come to deal with the general theory of relativity,\r\n treated in the second part of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus obtain the following result: Every description of events in\r\nspace involves the use of a rigid body to which such events have to be\r\nreferred. The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws of\r\nEuclidean geometry hold for “distances;” the “distance” being\r\nrepresented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a\r\nrigid body.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nSPACE AND TIME IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS\r\n\r\nThe purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their\r\nposition in space with “time.” I should load my conscience with grave\r\nsins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the aims\r\nof mechanics in this way, without serious reflection and detailed\r\nexplanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what is to be understood here by “position” and\r\n“space.” I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is\r\ntravelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without\r\nthrowing it. Then, disregarding the influence of the air resistance, I\r\nsee the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes the\r\nmisdeed from the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in a\r\nparabolic curve. I now ask: Do the “positions” traversed by the stone\r\nlie “in reality” on a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover, what is\r\nmeant here by motion “in space”? From the considerations of the\r\nprevious section the answer is self-evident. In the first place we\r\nentirely shun the vague word “space,” of which, we must honestly\r\nacknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception, and we replace it\r\nby “motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference.” The\r\npositions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage or\r\nembankment) have already been defined in detail in the preceding\r\nsection. If instead of “body of reference” we insert “system of\r\nco-ordinates,” which is a useful idea for mathematical description, we\r\nare in a position to say: The stone traverses a straight line relative\r\nto a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the carriage, but\r\nrelative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the ground\r\n(embankment) it describes a parabola. With the aid of this example it\r\nis clearly seen that there is no such thing as an independently\r\nexisting trajectory (lit. “path-curve”[6], but only a trajectory\r\nrelative to a particular body of reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] That is, a curve along which the body moves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to have a _complete_ description of the motion, we must\r\nspecify how the body alters its position _with time; i.e._ for every\r\npoint on the trajectory it must be stated at what time the body is\r\nsituated there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of\r\ntime that, in virtue of this definition, these time-values can be\r\nregarded essentially as magnitudes (results of measurements) capable of\r\nobservation. If we take our stand on the ground of classical mechanics,\r\nwe can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the following\r\nmanner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction; the man at the\r\nrailway-carriage window is holding one of them, and the man on the\r\nfootpath the other. Each of the observers determines the position on\r\nhis own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick of the clock\r\nhe is holding in his hand. In this connection we have not taken account\r\nof the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the velocity of\r\npropagation of light. With this and with a second difficulty prevailing\r\nhere we shall have to deal in detail later.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE GALILEIAN SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of\r\nGalilei-Newton, which is known as the _law of inertia_, can be stated\r\nthus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a\r\nstate of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not\r\nonly says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also\r\nindicates the reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible\r\nin mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible\r\nfixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to\r\na high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates\r\nwhich is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system,\r\nevery fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of\r\nan astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the\r\nlaw of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these\r\nmotions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed\r\nstars do not move in a circle. A system of co-ordinates of which the\r\nstate of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it is\r\ncalled a “Galileian system of co-ordinates.” The laws of the mechanics\r\nof Galilei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a Galileian system\r\nof co-ordinates.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY (IN THE RESTRICTED SENSE)\r\n\r\nIn order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to\r\nour example of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling\r\nuniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation (“uniform” because\r\nit is of constant velocity and direction, “translation” because\r\nalthough the carriage changes its position relative to the embankment\r\nyet it does not rotate in so doing). Let us imagine a raven flying\r\nthrough the air in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the\r\nembankment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe\r\nthe flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we should find that\r\nthe motion of the raven would be one of different velocity and\r\ndirection, but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line.\r\nExpressed in an abstract manner we may say: If a mass _m_ is moving\r\nuniformly in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system _K_,\r\nthen it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative\r\nto a second co-ordinate system _K′_ provided that the latter is\r\nexecuting a uniform translatory motion with respect to _K_. In\r\naccordance with the discussion contained in the preceding section, it\r\nfollows that:\r\n\r\nIf _K_ is a Galileian co-ordinate system. then every other co-ordinate\r\nsystem _K′_ is a Galileian one, when, in relation to _K_, it is in a\r\ncondition of uniform motion of translation. Relative to _K′_ the\r\nmechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as they do with\r\nrespect to _K_.\r\n\r\nWe advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the\r\ntenet thus: If, relative to _K_, _K′_ is a uniformly moving co-ordinate\r\nsystem devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course with\r\nrespect to _K′_ according to exactly the same general laws as with\r\nrespect to _K_. This statement is called the _principle of relativity_\r\n(in the restricted sense).\r\n\r\nAs long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable of\r\nrepresentation with the help of classical mechanics, there was no need\r\nto doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in view of\r\nthe more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it became\r\nmore and more evident that classical mechanics affords an insufficient\r\nfoundation for the physical description of all natural phenomena. At\r\nthis juncture the question of the validity of the principle of\r\nrelativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not appear impossible\r\nthat the answer to this question might be in the negative.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak\r\nvery much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity.\r\nEven though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently\r\nbroad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical phenomena,\r\nstill we must grant it a considerable measure of “truth,” since it\r\nsupplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies with a\r\ndelicacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of\r\nrelativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the domain of\r\n_mechanics_. But that a principle of such broad generality should hold\r\nwith such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet should be\r\ninvalid for another, is _a priori_ not very probable.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall\r\nreturn later. If the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense)\r\ndoes not hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems _K, K′, K″_,\r\netc., which are moving uniformly relative to each other, will not be\r\n_equivalent_ for the description of natural phenomena. In this case we\r\nshould be constrained to believe that natural laws are capable of being\r\nformulated in a particularly simple manner, and of course only on\r\ncondition that, from amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate\r\nsystems, we should have chosen _one_ (_K0_) of a particular state of\r\nmotion as our body of reference. We should then be justified (because\r\nof its merits for the description of natural phenomena) in calling this\r\nsystem “absolutely at rest,” and all other Galileian systems _K_ “in\r\nmotion.” If, for instance, our embankment were the system _K0_ then our\r\nrailway carriage would be a system _K_, relative to which less simple\r\nlaws would hold than with respect to _K0_. This diminished simplicity\r\nwould be due to the fact that the carriage _K_ would be in motion\r\n(_i.e._ “really”)with respect to _K0_. In the general laws of nature\r\nwhich have been formulated with reference to _K_, the magnitude and\r\ndirection of the velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a\r\npart. We should expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an\r\norganpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel\r\nwould be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were\r\nplaced perpendicular to this direction.\r\n\r\nNow in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is\r\ncomparable with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about\r\n30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not valid\r\nwe should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the earth at\r\nany moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that physical\r\nsystems in their behaviour would be dependent on the orientation in\r\nspace with respect to the earth. For owing to the alteration in\r\ndirection of the velocity of revolution of the earth in the course of a\r\nyear, the earth cannot be at rest relative to the hypothetical system\r\n_K0_ throughout the whole year. However, the most careful observations\r\nhave never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical\r\nspace, _i.e._ a physical non-equivalence of different directions. This\r\nis very powerful argument in favour of the principle of relativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nTHE THEOREM OF THE ADDITION OF VELOCITIES EMPLOYED IN CLASSICAL\r\nMECHANICS\r\n\r\nLet us suppose our old friend the railway carriage to be travelling\r\nalong the rails with a constant velocity _v_, and that a man traverses\r\nthe length of the carriage in the direction of travel with a velocity\r\n_w_. How quickly or, in other words, with what velocity _W_ does the\r\nman advance relative to the embankment during the process? The only\r\npossible answer seems to result from the following consideration: If\r\nthe man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to\r\nthe embankment through a distance _v_ equal numerically to the velocity\r\nof the carriage. As a consequence of his walking, however, he traverses\r\nan additional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence also\r\nrelative to the embankment, in this second, the distance w being\r\nnumerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking. Thus in\r\ntotal he covers the distance _W = v + w_ relative to the embankment in\r\nthe second considered. We shall see later that this result, which\r\nexpresses the theorem of the addition of velocities employed in\r\nclassical mechanics, cannot be maintained; in other words, the law that\r\nwe have just written down does not hold in reality. For the time being,\r\nhowever, we shall assume its correctness.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nTHE APPARENT INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE LAW OF PROPAGATION OF LIGHT WITH\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which\r\nlight is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows, or\r\nbelieves he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines\r\nwith a velocity _c_ = 300,000 km./sec. At all events we know with great\r\nexactness that this velocity is the same for all colours, because if\r\nthis were not the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed\r\nsimultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixed star\r\nby its dark neighbour. By means of similar considerations based on\r\nobservations of double stars, the Dutch astronomer De Sitter was also\r\nable to show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot depend on\r\nthe velocity of motion of the body emitting the light. The assumption\r\nthat this velocity of propagation is dependent on the direction “in\r\nspace” is in itself improbable.\r\n\r\nIn short, let us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the\r\nvelocity of light _c_ (in vacuum) is justifiably believed by the child\r\nat school. Who would imagine that this simple law has plunged the\r\nconscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual\r\ndifficulties? Let us consider how these difficulties arise.\r\n\r\nOf course we must refer the process of the propagation of light (and\r\nindeed every other process) to a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate\r\nsystem). As such a system let us again choose our embankment. We shall\r\nimagine the air above it to have been removed. If a ray of light be\r\nsent along the embankment, we see from the above that the tip of the\r\nray will be transmitted with the velocity _c_ relative to the\r\nembankment. Now let us suppose that our railway carriage is again\r\ntravelling along the railway lines with the velocity _v_, and that its\r\ndirection is the same as that of the ray of light, but its velocity of\r\ncourse much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of propagation of\r\nthe ray of light relative to the carriage. It is obvious that we can\r\nhere apply the consideration of the previous section, since the ray of\r\nlight plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the\r\ncarriage. The velocity _W_ of the man relative to the embankment is\r\nhere replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. _w_\r\nis the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we\r\nhave\r\n\r\n_w = c – v._\r\n\r\nThe velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the carriage\r\nthus comes out smaller than _c_.\r\n\r\nBut this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativity\r\nset forth in Section V. For, like every other general law of nature,\r\nthe law of the transmission of light _in vacuo_ [in vacuum] must,\r\naccording to the principle of relativity, be the same for the railway\r\ncarriage as reference-body as when the rails are the body of reference.\r\nBut, from our above consideration, this would appear to be impossible.\r\nIf every ray of light is propagated relative to the embankment with the\r\nvelocity _c_, then for this reason it would appear that another law of\r\npropagation of light must necessarily hold with respect to the\r\ncarriage—a result contradictory to the principle of relativity.\r\n\r\nIn view of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than to\r\nabandon either the principle of relativity or the simple law of the\r\npropagation of light _in vacuo_. Those of you who have carefully\r\nfollowed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we\r\nshould retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so\r\nconvincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple. The\r\nlaw of the propagation of light _in vacuo_ would then have to be\r\nreplaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of\r\nrelativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, however, that\r\nwe cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making theoretical\r\ninvestigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical\r\nphenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this\r\ndomain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of\r\nwhich the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a\r\nnecessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were therefore\r\nmore inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of the\r\nfact that no empirical data had been found which were contradictory to\r\nthis principle.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a\r\nresult of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space, it\r\nbecame evident that _in reality there is not the least incompatibilitiy\r\nbetween the principle of relativity and the law of propagation of\r\nlight_, and that by systematically holding fast to both these laws a\r\nlogically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory has been called\r\nthe _special theory of relativity_ to distinguish it from the extended\r\ntheory, with which we shall deal later. In the following pages we shall\r\npresent the fundamental ideas of the special theory of relativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nON THE IDEA OF TIME IN PHYSICS\r\n\r\nLightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at two places\r\n_A_ and _B_ far distant from each other. I make the additional\r\nassertion that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If\r\nI ask you whether there is sense in this statement, you will answer my\r\nquestion with a decided “Yes.” But if I now approach you with the\r\nrequest to explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely, you\r\nfind after some consideration that the answer to this question is not\r\nso easy as it appears at first sight.\r\n\r\nAfter some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you: “The\r\nsignificance of the statement is clear in itself and needs no further\r\nexplanation; of course it would require some consideration if I were to\r\nbe commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual case\r\nthe two events took place simultaneously or not.” I cannot be satisfied\r\nwith this answer for the following reason. Supposing that as a result\r\nof ingenious considerations an able meteorologist were to discover that\r\nthe lightning must always strike the places _A_ and _B_ simultaneously,\r\nthen we should be faced with the task of testing whether or not this\r\ntheoretical result is in accordance with the reality. We encounter the\r\nsame difficulty with all physical statements in which the conception\r\n“simultaneous” plays a part. The concept does not exist for the\r\nphysicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not it\r\nis fulfilled in an actual case. We thus require a definition of\r\nsimultaneity such that this definition supplies us with the method by\r\nmeans of which, in the present case, he can decide by experiment\r\nwhether or not both the lightning strokes occurred simultaneously. As\r\nlong as this requirement is not satisfied, I allow myself to be\r\ndeceived as a physicist (and of course the same applies if I am not a\r\nphysicist), when I imagine that I am able to attach a meaning to the\r\nstatement of simultaneity. (I would ask the reader not to proceed\r\nfarther until he is fully convinced on this point.)\r\n\r\nAfter thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the\r\nfollowing suggestion with which to test simultaneity. By measuring\r\nalong the rails, the connecting line _AB_ should be measured up and an\r\nobserver placed at the mid-point M of the distance _AB_. This observer\r\nshould be supplied with an arrangement (_e.g._ two mirrors inclined at\r\n90°) which allows him visually to observe both places _A_ and _B_ at\r\nthe same time. If the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning\r\nat the same time, then they are simultaneous.\r\n\r\nI am very pleased with this suggestion, but for all that I cannot\r\nregard the matter as quite settled, because I feel constrained to raise\r\nthe following objection: “Your definition would certainly be right, if\r\nonly I knew that the light by means of which the observer at _M_\r\nperceives the lightning flashes travels along the length _A_ → _M_ with\r\nthe same velocity as along the length _B_ → _M_. But an examination of\r\nthis supposition would only be possible if we already had at our\r\ndisposal the means of measuring time. It would thus appear as though we\r\nwere moving here in a logical circle.”\r\n\r\nAfter further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at\r\nme—and rightly so—and you declare: “I maintain my previous definition\r\nnevertheless, because in reality it assumes absolutely nothing about\r\nlight. There is only _one_ demand to be made of the definition of\r\nsimultaneity, namely, that in every real case it must supply us with an\r\nempirical decision as to whether or not the conception that has to be\r\ndefined is fulfilled. That my definition satisfies this demand is\r\nindisputable. That light requires the same time to traverse the path\r\n_A_ → _M_ as for the path _B_ → _M_ is in reality neither a\r\n_supposition nor a hypothesis_ about the physical nature of light, but\r\na _stipulation_ which I can make of my own freewill in order to arrive\r\nat a definition of simultaneity.”\r\n\r\nIt is clear that this definition can be used to give an exact meaning\r\nnot only to _two_ events, but to as many events as we care to choose,\r\nand independently of the positions of the scenes of the events with\r\nrespect to the body of reference[7] (here the railway embankment). We\r\nare thus led also to a definition of “time” in physics. For this\r\npurpose we suppose that clocks of identical construction are placed at\r\nthe points _A, B_ and _C_ of the railway line (co-ordinate system) and\r\nthat they are set in such a manner that the positions of their pointers\r\nare simultaneously (in the above sense) the same. Under these\r\nconditions we understand by the “time” of an event the reading\r\n(position of the hands) of that one of these clocks which is in the\r\nimmediate vicinity (in space) of the event. In this manner a time-value\r\nis associated with every event which is essentially capable of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] We suppose further that, when three events _A, B_ and _C_ occur in\r\n different places in such a manner that, if _A_ is simultaneous with\r\n _B_, and _B_ is simultaneous with _C_ (simultaneous in the sense of\r\n the above definition), then the criterion for the simultaneity of the\r\n pair of events _A, C_ is also satisfied. This assumption is a physical\r\n hypothesis about the law of propagation of light; it must certainly be\r\n fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the\r\n velocity of light _in vacuo_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validity\r\nof which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the\r\ncontrary. It has been assumed that all these clocks _go at the same\r\nrate_ if they are of identical construction. Stated more exactly: When\r\ntwo clocks arranged at rest in different places of a reference-body are\r\nset in such a manner that a _particular_ position of the pointers of\r\nthe one clock is _simultaneous_ (in the above sense) with the _same_\r\nposition, of the pointers of the other clock, then identical “settings”\r\nare always simultaneous (in the sense of the above definition).\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIVITY OF SIMULTANEITY\r\n\r\nUp to now our considerations have been referred to a particular body of\r\nreference, which we have styled a “railway embankment.” We suppose a\r\nvery long train travelling along the rails with the constant velocity v\r\nand in the direction indicated in Fig 1. People travelling in this\r\ntrain will with a vantage view the train as a rigid reference-body\r\n(co-ordinate system); they regard all events in reference to the train.\r\nThen every event which takes place along the line also takes place at a\r\nparticular point of the train. Also the definition of simultaneity can\r\nbe given relative to the train in exactly the same way as with respect\r\nto the embankment. As a natural consequence, however, the following\r\nquestion arises:\r\n\r\nimage001\r\n\r\n\r\nAre two events (_e.g._ the two strokes of lightning _A_ and _B_) which\r\nare simultaneous _with reference to the railway embankment_ also\r\nsimultaneous _relatively to the train?_ We shall show directly that the\r\nanswer must be in the negative.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that the lightning strokes _A_ and _B_ are simultaneous\r\nwith respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light emitted at\r\nthe places _A_ and _B_, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at\r\nthe mid-point _M_ of the length _A_ → _B_ of the embankment. But the\r\nevents _A_ and _B_ also correspond to positions _A_ and _B_ on the\r\ntrain. Let _M′_ be the mid-point of the distance _A_ → _B_ on the\r\ntravelling train. Just when the flashes (as judged from the embankment)\r\nof lightning occur, this point _M′_ naturally coincides with the point\r\n_M_ but it moves towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v\r\nof the train. If an observer sitting in the position _M′_ in the train\r\ndid not possess this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M,\r\nand the light rays emitted by the flashes of lightning _A_ and _B_\r\nwould reach him simultaneously, _i.e._ they would meet just where he is\r\nsituated. Now in reality (considered with reference to the railway\r\nembankment) he is hastening towards the beam of light coming from _B_,\r\nwhilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light coming from _A_.\r\nHence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from _B_ earlier\r\nthan he will see that emitted from _A_. Observers who take the railway\r\ntrain as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion\r\nthat the lightning flash _B_ took place earlier than the lightning\r\nflash _A_. We thus arrive at the important result:\r\n\r\nEvents which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not\r\nsimultaneous with respect to the train, and _vice versa_ (relativity of\r\nsimultaneity). Every reference-body (co-ordinate system) has its own\r\nparticular time; unless we are told the reference-body to which the\r\nstatement of time refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the\r\ntime of an event.\r\n\r\nNow before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always tacitly\r\nbeen assumed in physics that the statement of time had an absolute\r\nsignificance, _i.e._ that it is independent of the state of motion of\r\nthe body of reference. But we have just seen that this assumption is\r\nincompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity; if we\r\ndiscard this assumption, then the conflict between the law of the\r\npropagation of light _in vacuo_ and the principle of relativity\r\n(developed in Section VII) disappears.\r\n\r\nWe were led to that conflict by the considerations of Section VI, which\r\nare now no longer tenable. In that section we concluded that the man in\r\nthe carriage, who traverses the distance _w per second_ relative to the\r\ncarriage, traverses the same distance also with respect to the\r\nembankment _in each second_ of time. But, according to the foregoing\r\nconsiderations, the time required by a particular occurrence with\r\nrespect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration of\r\nthe same occurrence as judged from the embankment (as reference-body).\r\nHence it cannot be contended that the man in walking travels the\r\ndistance _w_ relative to the railway line in a time which is equal to\r\none second as judged from the embankment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the considerations of Section VI are based on yet a second\r\nassumption, which, in the light of a strict consideration, appears to\r\nbe arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made even before the\r\nintroduction of the theory of relativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nON THE RELATIVITY OF THE CONCEPTION OF DISTANCE\r\n\r\nLet us consider two particular points on the train [8] travelling along\r\nthe embankment with the velocity _v_, and inquire as to their distance\r\napart. We already know that it is necessary to have a body of reference\r\nfor the measurement of a distance, with respect to which body the\r\ndistance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use the train\r\nitself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). An observer in the train\r\nmeasures the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in a straight\r\nline (_e.g._ along the floor of the carriage) as many times as is\r\nnecessary to take him from the one marked point to the other. Then the\r\nnumber which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the\r\nrequired distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] _e.g._ the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the\r\nrailway line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call\r\n_A′_ and _B′_ the two points on the train whose distance apart is\r\nrequired, then both of these points are moving with the velocity v\r\nalong the embankment. In the first place we require to determine the\r\npoints _A_ and _B_ of the embankment which are just being passed by the\r\ntwo points _A′_ and _B′_ at a particular time t—judged from the\r\nembankment. These points _A_ and _B_ of the embankment can be\r\ndetermined by applying the definition of time given in Section VIII.\r\nThe distance between these points A and B is then measured by repeated\r\napplication of the measuring-rod along the embankment.\r\n\r\n_A priori_ it is by no means certain that this last measurement will\r\nsupply us with the same result as the first. Thus the length of the\r\ntrain as measured from the embankment may be different from that\r\nobtained by measuring in the train itself. This circumstance leads us\r\nto a second objection which must be raised against the apparently\r\nobvious consideration of Section VI. Namely, if the man in the carriage\r\ncovers the distance _w_ in a unit of time—_measured from the\r\ntrain_,—then this distance—_as measured from the embankment_ is not\r\nnecessarily also equal to _w_.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nTHE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe results of the last three sections show that the apparent\r\nincompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle\r\nof relativity (Section VII) has been derived by means of a\r\nconsideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses from\r\nclassical mechanics; these are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of the\r\ncondition of motion of the body of reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) The space-interval (distance) between two points of a rigid body is\r\nindependent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section VII\r\ndisappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived\r\nin Section VI becomes invalid. The possibility presents itself that the\r\nlaw of the propagation of light _in vacuo_ may be compatible with the\r\nprinciple of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to modify\r\nthe considerations of Section VI in order to remove the apparent\r\ndisagreement between these two fundamental results of experience? This\r\nquestion leads to a general one. In the discussion of Section VI we\r\nhave to do with places and times relative both to the train and to the\r\nembankment. How are we to find the place and time of an event in\r\nrelation to the train, when we know the place and time of the event\r\nwith respect to the railway embankment? Is there a thinkable answer to\r\nthis question of such a nature that the law of transmission of light\r\n_in vacuo_ does not contradict the principle of relativity? In other\r\nwords: Can we conceive of a relation between place and time of the\r\nindividual events relative to both reference-bodies, such that every\r\nray of light possesses the velocity of transmission _c_ relative to the\r\nembankment and relative to the train? This question leads to a quite\r\ndefinite positive answer, and to a perfectly definite transformation\r\nlaw for the space-time magnitudes of an event when changing over from\r\none body of reference to another.\r\n\r\nBefore we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental\r\nconsideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking\r\nplace along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the\r\nfunction of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section II we\r\ncan imagine this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a\r\nvertical direction by means of a framework of rods, so that an event\r\nwhich takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this\r\nframework. Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with the\r\nvelocity _v_ to be continued across the whole of space, so that every\r\nevent, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised with\r\nrespect to the second framework. Without committing any fundamental\r\nerror, we can disregard the fact that in reality these frameworks would\r\ncontinually interfere with each other, owing to the impenetrability of\r\nsolid bodies. In every such framework we imagine three surfaces\r\nperpendicular to each other marked out, and designated as “co-ordinate\r\nplanes” (“co-ordinate system”). A co-ordinate system _K_ then\r\ncorresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system _K′_ to the\r\ntrain. An event, wherever it may have taken place, would be fixed in\r\nspace with respect to _K_ by the three perpendiculars _x, y, z_ on the\r\nco-ordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value _t_.\r\nRelative to _K′, the same event_ would be fixed in respect of space and\r\ntime by corresponding values _x′, y′, z′, t′_, which of course are not\r\nidentical with _x, y, z, t_. It has already been set forth in detail\r\nhow these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical\r\nmeasurements.\r\n\r\nimage002\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following\r\nmanner. What are the values _x′, y′, z′, t′_, of an event with respect\r\nto _K′_, when the magnitudes _x, y, z, t_, of the same event with\r\nrespect to _K_ are given? The relations must be so chosen that the law\r\nof the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same\r\nray of light (and of course for every ray) with respect to _K_ and\r\n_K′_. For the relative orientation in space of the co-ordinate systems\r\nindicated in the diagram (Fig. 2), this problem is solved by means of\r\nthe equations:\r\n\r\nimage003\r\n\r\n\r\n_y′_ = _y_\r\n\r\n_z′_ = _z_\r\n\r\n\r\nimage004\r\n\r\n\r\nThis system of equations is known as the “Lorentz transformation.”[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] A simple derivation of the Lorentz transformation is given in\r\n Appendix I.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf in place of the law of transmission of light we had taken as our\r\nbasis the tacit assumptions of the older mechanics as to the absolute\r\ncharacter of times and lengths, then instead of the above we should\r\nhave obtained the following equations:\r\n\r\n_x′_ = _x_ – _vt_\r\n\r\n\r\n_y′_ = _y_\r\n\r\n\r\n_z′_ = _z_\r\n\r\n\r\n_t′_ = _t_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis system of equations is often termed the “Galilei transformation.”\r\nThe Galilei transformation can be obtained from the Lorentz\r\ntransformation by substituting an infinitely large value for the\r\nvelocity of light _c_ in the latter transformation.\r\n\r\nAided by the following illustration, we can readily see that, in\r\naccordance with the Lorentz transformation, the law of the transmission\r\nof light _in vacuo_ is satisfied both for the reference-body _K_ and\r\nfor the reference-body _K′_. A light-signal is sent along the positive\r\n_x_-axis, and this light-stimulus advances in accordance with the\r\nequation\r\n\r\n_x_ = _ct_,\r\n\r\n\r\n_i.e._ with the velocity _c_. According to the equations of the Lorentz\r\ntransformation, this simple relation between _x_ and _t_ involves a\r\nrelation between _x′_ and _t′_. In point of fact, if we substitute for\r\n_x_ the value _ct_ in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz\r\ntransformation, we obtain:\r\n\r\nimage005\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom which, by division, the expression\r\n\r\n_x′_ = _ct′_\r\n\r\n\r\nimmediately follows. If referred to the system _K′_, the propagation of\r\nlight takes place according to this equation. We thus see that the\r\nvelocity of transmission relative to the reference-body _K′_ is also\r\nequal to _c_. The same result is obtained for rays of light advancing\r\nin any other direction whatsoever. Of cause this is not surprising,\r\nsince the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived\r\nconformably to this point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEHAVIOUR OF MEASURING-RODS AND CLOCKS IN MOTION\r\n\r\nPlace a metre-rod in the _x′_-axis of _K′_ in such a manner that one\r\nend (the beginning) coincides with the point _x′_ = 0 whilst the other\r\nend (the end of the rod) coincides with the point _x′_ = 1. What is the\r\nlength of the metre-rod relatively to the system _K_? In order to learn\r\nthis, we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of\r\nthe rod lie with respect to _K_ at a particular time _t_ of the system\r\n_K_. By means of the first equation of the Lorentz transformation the\r\nvalues of these two points at the time _t_ = 0 can be shown to be\r\n\r\nimage006\r\n\r\n\r\nthe distance between the points being\r\n\r\nimage007\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the metre-rod is moving with the velocity _v_ relative to _K_. It\r\ntherefore follows that the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the\r\ndirection of its length with a velocity _v_ is\r\n\r\nimage008\r\n\r\n\r\nof a metre. The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at\r\nrest, and the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For\r\nthe velocity _v_ = _c_ we should have\r\n\r\nimage009\r\n\r\n\r\nand for still greater velocities the square-root becomes imaginary.\r\nFrom this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity _c_\r\nplays the part of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached nor\r\nexceeded by any real body.\r\n\r\nOf course this feature of the velocity _c_ as a limiting velocity also\r\nclearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for\r\nthese became meaningless if we choose values of _v_ greater than _c_.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the\r\n_x_-axis with respect to _K_, then we should have found that the length\r\nof the rod as judged from _K′_ would have been\r\n\r\nimage010\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which\r\nforms the basis of our considerations.\r\n\r\n_A priori_ it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something\r\nabout the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the\r\nequations of transformation, for the magnitudes _z, y, x, t_, are\r\nnothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by\r\nmeans of measuring-rods and clocks. If we had based our considerations\r\non the Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a\r\ncontraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider a seconds-clock which is permanently situated at\r\nthe origin (_x′_ = 0) of _K′_. _t′_ = 0 and _t′_ = 1 are two successive\r\nticks of this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz\r\ntransformation give for these two ticks:\r\n\r\n_t_ = 0\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nimage011\r\n\r\n\r\nAs judged from _K_, the clock is moving with the velocity _v_; as\r\njudged from this reference-body, the time which elapses between two\r\nstrokes of the clock is not one second, but\r\n\r\nimage012\r\n\r\n\r\nseconds, _i.e._ a somewhat larger time. As a consequence of its motion\r\nthe clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity\r\n_c_ plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nTHEOREM OF THE ADDITION OF VELOCITIES. THE EXPERIMENT OF FIZEAU\r\n\r\nNow in practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with\r\nvelocities that are small compared with the velocity of light; hence we\r\nshall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section\r\ndirectly with the reality. But, on the other hand, these results must\r\nstrike you as being very singular, and for that reason I shall now draw\r\nanother conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be derived\r\nfrom the foregoing considerations, and which has been most elegantly\r\nconfirmed by experiment.\r\n\r\nIn Section VI we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities in\r\none direction in the form which also results from the hypotheses of\r\nclassical mechanics. This theorem can also be deduced readily from the\r\nGalilei transformation (Section XI). In place of the man walking inside\r\nthe carriage, we introduce a point moving relatively to the co-ordinate\r\nsystem _K′_ in accordance with the equation\r\n\r\n_x′_ = _wt′_\r\n\r\nBy means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei\r\ntransformation we can express _x′_ and _t′_ in terms of _x_ and _t_,\r\nand we then obtain\r\n\r\n_x_ = (_v_ + _w_)_t_\r\n\r\nThis equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion of the\r\npoint with reference to the system _K_ (of the man with reference to\r\nthe embankment). We denote this velocity by the symbol _W_, and we then\r\nobtain, as in Section VI,\r\n\r\n_W_ = _v_ + _w_ . . . . . . . (A).\r\n\r\nBut we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of\r\nthe theory of relativity. In the equation\r\n\r\n_x′_ = _wt′_\r\n\r\nwe must then express _x′_ and _t′_ in terms of _x_ and _t_, making use\r\nof the first and fourth equations of the _Lorentz transformation_.\r\nInstead of the equation (A) we then obtain the equation\r\n\r\nimage013\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in one\r\ndirection according to the theory of relativity. The question now\r\narises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with\r\nexperience. On this point we are enlightened by a most important\r\nexperiment which the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than\r\nhalf a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some of\r\nthe best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about\r\nits result. The experiment is concerned with the following question.\r\nLight travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity _w_.\r\nHow quickly does it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube\r\n_T_ (see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when the liquid above\r\nmentioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity _v_?\r\n\r\nimage014\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have\r\nto take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place\r\nwith the same velocity _w with respect to the liquid_, whether the\r\nlatter is in motion with reference to other bodies or not. The velocity\r\nof light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the latter relative\r\nto the tube are thus known, and we require the velocity of light\r\nrelative to the tube.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we have the problem of Section VI again before us. The\r\ntube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the co-ordinate\r\nsystem _K_, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the\r\nco-ordinate system _K′_, and finally, the light plays the part of the\r\nman walking along the carriage, or of the moving point in the present\r\nsection. If we denote the velocity of the light relative to the tube by\r\n_W_, then this is given by the equation (A) or (B), according as the\r\nGalilei transformation or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to the\r\nfacts. Experiment[10] decides in favour of equation (B) derived from\r\nthe theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very exact.\r\nAccording to recent and most excellent measurements by Zeeman, the\r\ninfluence of the velocity of flow _v_ on the propagation of light is\r\nrepresented by formula (B) to within one per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] Fizeau found\r\n\r\n\r\nimage015\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n\r\nimage016\r\n\r\n\r\nis the index of refraction of the liquid. On the other hand, owing to\r\nthe smallness of\r\n\r\n\r\nimage017\r\n\r\n\r\nas compared with 1, we can replace (B) in the first place by\r\n\r\n\r\nimage018\r\n\r\n\r\nor to the same order of approximation by\r\n\r\n\r\nimage019\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich agrees with Fizeau’s result.\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of\r\nthis phenomenon was given by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement of\r\nthe theory of relativity. This theory was of a purely electrodynamical\r\nnature, and was obtained by the use of particular hypotheses as to the\r\nelectromagnetic structure of matter. This circumstance, however, does\r\nnot in the least diminish the conclusiveness of the experiment as a\r\ncrucial test in favour of the theory of relativity, for the\r\nelectrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on which the original theory was\r\nbased, in no way opposes the theory of relativity. Rather has the\r\nlatter been developed trom electrodynamics as an astoundingly simple\r\ncombination and generalisation of the hypotheses, formerly independent\r\nof each other, on which electrodynamics was built.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE HEURISTIC VALUE OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nOur train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the\r\nfollowing manner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on the one\r\nhand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on the other hand\r\nthe velocity of transmission of light _in vacuo_ has to be considered\r\nequal to a constant _c_. By uniting these two postulates we obtained\r\nthe law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates _x, y, z_\r\nand the time _t_ of the events which constitute the processes of\r\nnature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei\r\ntransformation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the _Lorentz\r\ntransformation_.\r\n\r\nThe law of transmission of light, the acceptance of which is justified\r\nby our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of\r\nthought. Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we\r\ncan combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum up the\r\ntheory thus:\r\n\r\nEvery general law of nature must be so constituted that it is\r\ntransformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the\r\nspace-time variables _x, y, z, t_ of the original coordinate system\r\n_K_, we introduce new space-time variables _x′, y′, z′, t′_ of a\r\nco-ordinate system _K′_. In this connection the relation between the\r\nordinary and the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz\r\ntransformation. Or in brief: General laws of nature are co-variant with\r\nrespect to Lorentz transformations.\r\n\r\nThis is a definite mathematical condition that the theory of relativity\r\ndemands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the theory becomes a\r\nvaluable heuristic aid in the search for general laws of nature. If a\r\ngeneral law of nature were to be found which did not satisfy this\r\ncondition, then at least one of the two fundamental assumptions of the\r\ntheory would have been disproved. Let us now examine what general\r\nresults the latter theory has hitherto evinced.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nGENERAL RESULTS OF THE THEORY\r\n\r\nIt is clear from our previous considerations that the (special) theory\r\nof relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these\r\nfields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but it\r\nhas considerably simplified the theoretical structure, _i.e._ the\r\nderivation of laws, and—what is incomparably more important—it has\r\nconsiderably reduced the number of independent hypotheses forming the\r\nbasis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the\r\nMaxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been\r\ngenerally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less\r\nunequivocally in its favour.\r\n\r\nClassical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into\r\nline with the demands of the special theory of relativity. For the main\r\npart, however, this modification affects only the laws for rapid\r\nmotions, in which the velocities of matter _v_ are not very small as\r\ncompared with the velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid\r\nmotions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the\r\nvariations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make\r\nthemselves evident in practice. We shall not consider the motion of\r\nstars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In\r\naccordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a\r\nmaterial point of mass _m_ is no longer given by the well-known\r\nexpression\r\n\r\nimage020\r\n\r\n\r\nbut by the expression\r\n\r\nimage021\r\n\r\n\r\nThis expression approaches infinity as the velocity _v_ approaches the\r\nvelocity of light _c_. The velocity must therefore always remain less\r\nthan _c_, however great may be the energies used to produce the\r\nacceleration. If we develop the expression for the kinetic energy in\r\nthe form of a series, we obtain\r\n\r\nimage022\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n\r\nimage023\r\n\r\n\r\nis small compared with unity, the third of these terms is always small\r\nin comparison with the second, which last is alone considered in\r\nclassical mechanics. The first term _mc_2 does not contain the\r\nvelocity, and requires no consideration if we are only dealing with the\r\nquestion as to how the energy of a point-mass; depends on the velocity.\r\nWe shall speak of its essential significance later.\r\n\r\nThe most important result of a general character to which the special\r\ntheory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass.\r\nBefore the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation\r\nlaws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the conservation of\r\nenergy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental\r\nlaws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the\r\ntheory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall now\r\nbriefly consider how this unification came about, and what meaning is\r\nto be attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe principle of relativity requires that the law of the conservation\r\nof energy should hold not only with reference to a co-ordinate system\r\n_K_, but also with respect to every co-ordinate system _K′_ which is in\r\na state of uniform motion of translation relative to _K_, or, briefly,\r\nrelative to every “Galileian” system of co-ordinates. In contrast to\r\nclassical mechanics; the Lorentz transformation is the deciding factor\r\nin the transition from one such system to another.\r\n\r\nBy means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to draw the\r\nfollowing conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the\r\nfundamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body moving\r\nwith the velocity _v_, which absorbs[11] an amount of energy _E_0 in\r\nthe form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in\r\nthe process, has, as a consequence, its energy increased by an amount\r\n\r\nimage024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] _E_0 is the energy taken up, as judged from a co-ordinate system\r\n moving with the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the expression given above for the kinetic energy\r\nof the body, the required energy of the body comes out to be\r\n\r\nimage025\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the body has the same energy as a body of mass\r\n\r\nimage026\r\n\r\n\r\nmoving with the velocity _v_. Hence we can say: If a body takes up an\r\namount of energy _E_0, then its inertial mass increases by an amount\r\n\r\nimage027\r\n\r\n\r\nthe inertial mass of a body is not a constant but varies according to\r\nthe change in the energy of the body. The inertial mass of a system of\r\nbodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law of the\r\nconservation of the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of\r\nthe conservation of energy, and is only valid provided that the system\r\nneither takes up nor sends out energy. Writing the expression for the\r\nenergy in the form\r\n\r\nimage028\r\n\r\n\r\nwe see that the term _mc_2, which has hitherto attracted our attention,\r\nis nothing else than the energy possessed by the body[12] before it\r\nabsorbed the energy _E_0.\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] As judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nA direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible at\r\nthe present time (1920; see[Note], p. 48), owing to the fact that the\r\nchanges in energy _E_0 to which we can subject a system are not large\r\nenough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the inertial mass\r\nof the system.\r\n\r\nimage027\r\n\r\n\r\nis too small in comparison with the mass _m_, which was present before\r\nthe alteration of the energy. It is owing to this circumstance that\r\nclassical mechanics was able to establish successfully the conservation\r\nof mass as a law of independent validity.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Note] The equation E = mc2 has been thoroughly proved time and again\r\n since this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me add a final remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the\r\nFaraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance\r\nresulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things\r\nas instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary\r\nmedium) of the type of Newton’s law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the\r\nvelocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a\r\ndistance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of\r\ntransmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity _c_\r\nplays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see in\r\nwhat way this result becomes modified in the general theory of\r\nrelativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nTo what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by\r\nexperience? This question is not easily answered for the reason already\r\nmentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of Fizeau. The\r\nspecial theory of relativity has crystallised out from the\r\nMaxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Thus all facts of\r\nexperience which support the electromagnetic theory also support the\r\ntheory of relativity. As being of particular importance, I mention here\r\nthe fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the\r\neffects produced on the light reaching us from the fixed stars. These\r\nresults are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects\r\nindicated, which are due to the relative motion of the earth with\r\nreference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with\r\nexperience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position of\r\nthe fixed stars resulting from the motion of the earth round the sun\r\n(aberration), and to the influence of the radial components of the\r\nrelative motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the\r\ncolour of the light reaching us from them. The latter effect manifests\r\nitself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light\r\ntransmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with the position of\r\nthe same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source\r\nof light (Doppler principle). The experimental arguments in favour of\r\nthe Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in\r\nfavour of the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth\r\nhere. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities to such an\r\nextent, that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been\r\nable to hold its own when tested by experience.\r\n\r\nBut there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained which\r\ncan be represented in the Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the\r\nintroduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself—_i.e._ without\r\nmaking use of the theory of relativity—appears extraneous.\r\n\r\nIt is known that cathode rays and the so-called β-rays emitted by\r\nradioactive substances consist of negatively electrified particles\r\n(electrons) of very small inertia and large velocity. By examining the\r\ndeflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic\r\nfields, we can study the law of motion of these particles very exactly.\r\n\r\nIn the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the\r\ndifficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an\r\naccount of their nature. For since electrical masses of one sign repel\r\neach other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron\r\nwould necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual\r\nrepulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between\r\nthem, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.[13] If\r\nwe now assume that the relative distances between the electrical masses\r\nconstituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of the\r\nelectron (rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), we\r\narrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with\r\nexperience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was\r\nthe first to introduce the hypothesis that the form of the electron\r\nexperiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of\r\nthat motion. the contracted length being proportional to the expression\r\n\r\nimage029\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, hypothesis, which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical\r\nfacts, supplies us then with that particular law of motion which has\r\nbeen confirmed with great precision in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] The general theory of relativity renders it likely that the\r\n electrical masses of an electron are held together by gravitational\r\n forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of relativity leads to the same law of motion, without\r\nrequiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and the\r\nbehaviour of the electron. We arrived at a similar conclusion in\r\nSection XIII in connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result of\r\nwhich is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity of\r\ndrawing on hypotheses as to the physical nature of the liquid.\r\n\r\nThe second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to the\r\nquestion whether or not the motion of the earth in space can be made\r\nperceptible in terrestrial experiments. We have already remarked in\r\nSection V that all attempts of this nature led to a negative result.\r\nBefore the theory of relativity was put forward, it was difficult to\r\nbecome reconciled to this negative result, for reasons now to be\r\ndiscussed. The inherited prejudices about time and space did not allow\r\nany doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the Galileian\r\ntransformation for changing over from one body of reference to another.\r\nNow assuming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for a\r\nreference-body _K_, we then find that they do not hold for a\r\nreference-body _K′_ moving uniformly with respect to _K_, if we assume\r\nthat the relations of the Galileian transformation exist between the\r\nco-ordinates of _K_ and _K′_. It thus appears that, of all Galileian\r\nco-ordinate systems, one (_K_) corresponding to a particular state of\r\nmotion is physically unique. This result was interpreted physically by\r\nregarding _K_ as at rest with respect to a hypothetical æther of space.\r\nOn the other hand, all coordinate systems _K′_ moving relatively to _K_\r\nwere to be regarded as in motion with respect to the æther. To this\r\nmotion of _K′_ against the æther (“æther-drift” relative to _K′_) were\r\nattributed the more complicated laws which were supposed to hold\r\nrelative to _K′_. Strictly speaking, such an æther-drift ought also to\r\nbe assumed relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of\r\nphysicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an\r\næther-drift at the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nIn one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a method\r\nwhich appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine two mirrors so\r\narranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face each other.\r\nA ray of light requires a perfectly definite time _T_ to pass from one\r\nmirror to the other and back again, if the whole system be at rest with\r\nrespect to the æther. It is found by calculation, however, that a\r\nslightly different time _T′_ is required for this process, if the body,\r\ntogether with the mirrors, be moving relatively to the æther. And yet\r\nanother point: it is shown by calculation that for a given velocity _v_\r\nwith reference to the æther, this time _T′_ is different when the body\r\nis moving perpendicularly to the planes of the mirrors from that\r\nresulting when the motion is parallel to these planes. Although the\r\nestimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small,\r\nMichelson and Morley performed an experiment involving interference in\r\nwhich this difference should have been clearly detectable. But the\r\nexperiment gave a negative result—a fact very perplexing to physicists.\r\nLorentz and FitzGerald rescued the theory from this difficulty by\r\nassuming that the motion of the body relative to the æther produces a\r\ncontraction of the body in the direction of motion, the amount of\r\ncontraction being just sufficient to compensate for the difference in\r\ntime mentioned above. Comparison with the discussion in Section XII\r\nshows that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity this\r\nsolution of the difficulty was the right one. But on the basis of the\r\ntheory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more\r\nsatisfactory. According to this theory there is no such thing as a\r\n“specially favoured” (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the\r\nintroduction of the æther-idea, and hence there can be no æther-drift,\r\nnor any experiment with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction\r\nof moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the\r\ntheory, without the introduction of particular hypotheses; and as the\r\nprime factor involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in\r\nitself, to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with\r\nrespect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case in\r\npoint. Thus for a co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror\r\nsystem of Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it _is_ shortened\r\nfor a co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nMINKOWSKI’S FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE\r\n\r\nThe non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when he\r\nhears of “four-dimensional” things, by a feeling not unlike that\r\nawakened by thoughts of the occult. And yet there is no more\r\ncommon-place statement than that the world in which we live is a\r\nfour-dimensional space-time continuum.\r\n\r\nSpace is a three-dimensional continuum. By this we mean that it is\r\npossible to describe the position of a point (at rest) by means of\r\nthree numbers (co-ordinates) _x, y, z_, and that there is an indefinite\r\nnumber of points in the neighbourhood of this one, the position of\r\nwhich can be described by co-ordinates such as _x1, y1, z1_, which may\r\nbe as near as we choose to the respective values of the co-ordinates\r\n_x, y, z_, of the first point. In virtue of the latter property we\r\nspeak of a “continuum,” and owing to the fact that there are three\r\nco-ordinates we speak of it as being “three-dimensional.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called\r\n“world” by Minkowski is naturally four dimensional in the space-time\r\nsense. For it is composed of individual events, each of which is\r\ndescribed by four numbers, namely, three space co-ordinates _x, y, z_,\r\nand a time co-ordinate, the time value _t_. The “world” is in this\r\nsense also a continuum; for to every event there are as many\r\n“neighbouring” events (realised or at least thinkable) as we care to\r\nchoose, the co-ordinates _x1, y1, z1, t1_ of which differ by an\r\nindefinitely small amount from those of the event _x, y, z, t_\r\noriginally considered. That we have not been accustomed to regard the\r\nworld in this sense as a four-dimensional continuum is due to the fact\r\nthat in physics, before the advent of the theory of relativity, time\r\nplayed a different and more independent rôle, as compared with the\r\nspace coordinates. It is for this reason that we have been in the habit\r\nof treating time as an independent continuum. As a matter of fact,\r\naccording to classical mechanics, time is absolute, _i.e._ it is\r\nindependent of the position and the condition of motion of the system\r\nof co-ordinates. We see this expressed in the last equation of the\r\nGalileian transformation (_t′_ = _t_).\r\n\r\nThe four-dimensional mode of consideration of the “world” is natural on\r\nthe theory of relativity, since according to this theory time is robbed\r\nof its independence. This is shown by the fourth equation of the\r\nLorentz transformation:\r\n\r\nimage030\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, according to this equation the time difference Δ_t′_ of two\r\nevents with respect to _K′_ does not in general vanish, even when the\r\ntime difference Δ_t_ of the same events with reference to _K_ vanishes.\r\nPure “space-distance” of two events with respect to _K_ results in\r\n“time-distance ” of the same events with respect to _K_. But the\r\ndiscovery of Minkowski, which was of importance for the formal\r\ndevelopment of the theory of relativity, does not lie here. It is to be\r\nfound rather in the fact of his recognition that the four-dimensional\r\nspace-time continuum of the theory of relativity, in its most essential\r\nformal properties, shows a pronounced relationship to the\r\nthree-dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical space.[14] In\r\norder to give due prominence to this relationship, however, we must\r\nreplace the usual time co-ordinate t by an imaginary magnitude\r\n\r\nimage031\r\n\r\n\r\nproportional to it. Under these conditions, the natural laws satisfying\r\nthe demands of the (special) theory of relativity assume mathematical\r\nforms, in which the time co-ordinate plays exactly the same role as the\r\nthree space co-ordinates. Formally, these four co-ordinates correspond\r\nexactly to the three space co-ordinates in Euclidean geometry. It must\r\nbe clear even to the non-mathematician that, as a consequence of this\r\npurely formal addition to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained\r\nclearness in no mean measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] Cf. the somewhat more detailed discussion in Appendix II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese inadequate remarks can give the reader only a vague notion of the\r\nimportant idea contributed by Minkowski. Without it the general theory\r\nof relativity, of which the fundamental ideas are developed in the\r\nfollowing pages, would perhaps have got no farther than its long\r\nclothes. Minkowski’s work is doubtless difficult of access to anyone\r\ninexperienced in mathematics, but since it is not necessary to have a\r\nvery exact grasp of this work in order to understand the fundamental\r\nideas of either the special or the general theory of relativity, I\r\nshall leave it here at present, and revert to it only towards the end\r\nof Part II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II: THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL AND GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nThe basal principle, which was the pivot of all our previous\r\nconsiderations, was the _special_ principle of relativity, _i.e._ the\r\nprinciple of the physical relativity of all _uniform_ motion. Let as\r\nonce more analyse its meaning carefully.\r\n\r\nIt was at all times clear that, from the point of view of the idea it\r\nconveys to us, every motion must be considered only as a relative\r\nmotion. Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the\r\nembankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the\r\nmotion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are\r\nequally justifiable:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment,\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn (_a_) the embankment, in (_b_) the carriage, serves as the body of\r\nreference in our statement of the motion taking place. If it is simply\r\na question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in\r\nprinciple immaterial to what reference-body we refer the motion. As\r\nalready mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be confused\r\nwith the much more comprehensive statement called “the principle of\r\nrelativity,” which we have taken as the basis of our investigations.\r\n\r\nThe principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may\r\nequally well choose the carriage or the embankment as our\r\nreference-body for the description of any event (for this, too, is\r\nself-evident). Our principle rather asserts what follows: If we\r\nformulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from\r\nexperience, by making use of\r\n\r\n(_a_) the embankment as reference-body,\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) the railway carriage as reference-body,\r\n\r\n\r\nthen these general laws of nature (_e.g._ the laws of mechanics or the\r\nlaw of the propagation of light _in vacuo_) have exactly the same form\r\nin both cases. This can also be expressed as follows: For the physical\r\ndescription of natural processes, neither of the reference bodies _K,\r\nK′_ is unique (lit. “specially marked out”) as compared with the other.\r\nUnlike the first, this latter statement need not of necessity hold _a\r\npriori;_ it is not contained in the conceptions of “motion” and\r\n“reference-body” and derivable from them; only _experience_ can decide\r\nas to its correctness or incorrectness.\r\n\r\nUp to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the\r\nequivalence of _all_ bodies of reference _K_ in connection with the\r\nformulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the following\r\nIines. In the first place, we started out from the assumption that\r\nthere exists a reference-body _K_, whose condition of motion is such\r\nthat the Galileian law holds with respect to it: A particle left to\r\nitself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves\r\nuniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian\r\nreference-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible.\r\nBut in addition to K, all bodies of reference _K′_ should be given\r\npreference in this sense, and they should be exactly equivalent to _K_\r\nfor the formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state\r\nof _uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion_ with respect to _K_; all\r\nthese bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian\r\nreference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was\r\nassumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for others (_e.g._\r\nthose possessing motion of a different kind). In this sense we speak of\r\nthe _special_ principle of relativity, or special theory of relativity.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this we wish to understand by the “general principle of\r\nrelativity” the following statement: All bodies of reference _K, K′_,\r\netc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena\r\n(formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their\r\nstate of motion. But before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed\r\nout that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract\r\none, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been\r\njustified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must feel\r\nthe temptation to venture the step towards the general principle of\r\nrelativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable consideration\r\nseems to suggest that, for the present at any rate, there is little\r\nhope of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine ourselves\r\ntransferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is travelling\r\nat a uniform rate. As long as it is moving uniformly, the occupant of\r\nthe carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for this reason\r\nthat he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the case as\r\nindicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in motion.\r\nMoreover, according to the special principle of relativity, this\r\ninterpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of view.\r\nIf the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform motion,\r\nas for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then the\r\noccupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk\r\nforwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour\r\nof bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage. The\r\nmechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously\r\nconsidered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that\r\nthe same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving\r\ncarriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in\r\nuniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does\r\nnot hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of\r\nthis, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of\r\nabsolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the\r\ngeneral principle of relativity. But in what follows we shall soon see\r\nthat this conclusion cannot be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\r\n\r\n“If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the\r\nground?” The usual answer to this question is: “Because it is attracted\r\nby the earth.” Modern physics formulates the answer rather differently\r\nfor the following reason. As a result of the more careful study of\r\nelectromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard action at a distance\r\nas a process impossible without the intervention of some intermediary\r\nmedium. If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of iron, we cannot\r\nbe content to regard this as meaning that the magnet acts directly on\r\nthe iron through the intermediate empty space, but we are constrained\r\nto imagine—after the manner of Faraday—that the magnet always calls\r\ninto being something physically real in the space around it, that\r\nsomething being what we call a “magnetic field.” In its turn this\r\nmagnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that the latter\r\nstrives to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss here the\r\njustification for this incidental conception, which is indeed a\r\nsomewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid\r\nelectromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more\r\nsatisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the\r\ntransmission of electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also\r\nare regarded in an analogous manner.\r\n\r\nThe action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. The earth\r\nproduces in its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the\r\nstone and produces its motion of fall. As we know from experience, the\r\nintensity of the action on a body dimishes according to a quite\r\ndefinite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from the earth.\r\nFrom our point of view this means: The law governing the properties of\r\nthe gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one, in\r\norder correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action\r\nwith the distance from operative bodies. It is something like this: The\r\nbody (_e.g._ the earth) produces a field in its immediate neighbourhood\r\ndirectly; the intensity and direction of the field at points farther\r\nremoved from the body are thence determined by the law which governs\r\nthe properties in space of the gravitational fields themselves.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field\r\nexhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental importance\r\nfor what follows. Bodies which are moving under the sole influence of a\r\ngravitational field receive an acceleration, _which does not in the\r\nleast depend either on the material or on the physical state of the\r\nbody._ For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in\r\nexactly the same manner in a gravitational field (_in vacuo_), when\r\nthey start off from rest or with the same initial velocity. This law,\r\nwhich holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form in\r\nthe light of the following consideration.\r\n\r\nAccording to Newton’s law of motion, we have\r\n\r\n(Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration),\r\n\r\nwhere the “inertial mass” is a characteristic constant of the\r\naccelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration,\r\nwe then have\r\n\r\n(Force) = (gravitational mass) x (intensity of the gravitational\r\nfield),\r\n\r\nwhere the “gravitational mass” is likewise a characteristic constant\r\nfor the body. From these two relations follows:\r\n\r\nimage032\r\n\r\n\r\nIf now, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to be\r\nindependent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the\r\nsame for a given gravitational field, then the ratio of the\r\ngravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all\r\nbodies. By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio equal\r\nto unity. We then have the following law: The _gravitational_ mass of a\r\nbody is equal to its _inertial_ mass.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in\r\nmechanics, but it had not been _interpreted_. A satisfactory\r\ninterpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact:\r\n_The same_ quality of a body manifests itself according to\r\ncircumstances as “inertia” or as “weight” (lit. “heaviness”). In the\r\nfollowing section we shall show to what extent this is actually the\r\ncase, and how this question is connected with the general postulate of\r\nrelativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nTHE EQUALITY OF INERTIAL AND GRAVITATIONAL MASS AS AN ARGUMENT FOR THE\r\nGENERAL POSTULATE OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nWe imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars\r\nand other appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the\r\nconditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It is then\r\npossible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space\r\n(world), relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in\r\nmotion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As\r\nreference-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with\r\nan observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation\r\nnaturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself with\r\nstrings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the floor\r\nwill cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room.\r\n\r\nTo the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with\r\nrope attached, and now a “being” (what kind of a being is immaterial to\r\nus) begins pulling at this with a constant force. The chest together\r\nwith the observer then begin to move “upwards” with a uniformly\r\naccelerated motion. In course of time their velocity will reach\r\nunheard-of values—provided that we are viewing all this from another\r\nreference-body which is not being pulled with a rope.\r\n\r\nBut how does the man in the chest regard the Process? The acceleration\r\nof the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction of the floor of\r\nthe chest. He must therefore take up this pressure by means of his legs\r\nif he does not wish to be laid out full length on the floor. He is then\r\nstanding in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a\r\nroom of a home on our earth. If he releases a body which he previously\r\nhad in his land, the accelertion of the chest will no longer be\r\ntransmitted to this body, and for this reason the body will approach\r\nthe floor of the chest with an accelerated relative motion. The\r\nobserver will further convince himself _that the acceleration of the\r\nbody towards the floor of the chest is always of the same magnitude,\r\nwhatever kind of body he may happen to use for the experiment._\r\n\r\nRelying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was\r\ndiscussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will thus\r\ncome to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational\r\nfield which is constant with regard to time. Of course he will be\r\npuzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this\r\ngravitational field. just then, however, he discovers the hook in the\r\nmiddle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it,\r\nand he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is suspended\r\nat rest in the gravitational field.\r\n\r\nOught we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion? I\r\ndo not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consistent; we must\r\nrather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither\r\nreason nor known mechanical laws. Even though it is being accelerated\r\nwith respect to the “Galileian space” first considered, we can\r\nnevertheless regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good\r\ngrounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of\r\nreference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a\r\nresult we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate\r\nof relativity.\r\n\r\nWe must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of\r\ninterpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational\r\nfield of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, what comes to the\r\nsame thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational\r\nmass. If this natural law did not exist, the man in the accelerated\r\nchest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the bodies around\r\nhim on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he would not be\r\njustified on the grounds of experience in supposing his reference-body\r\nto be “at rest.”\r\n\r\nSuppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of the\r\nlid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The\r\nresult of this will be to stretch the rope so that it will hang\r\n“vertically” downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of\r\ntension in the rope, the man in the chest will say: “The suspended body\r\nexperiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this is\r\nneutralised by the tension of the rope; what determines the magnitude\r\nof the tension of the rope is the _gravitational mass_ of the suspended\r\nbody.” On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely in space\r\nwill interpret the condition of things thus: “The rope must perforce\r\ntake part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it transmits this\r\nmotion to the body attached to it. The tension of the rope is just\r\nlarge enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That which\r\ndetermines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the _inertial\r\nmass_ of the body.” Guided by this example, we see that our extension\r\nof the principle of relativity implies the _necessity_ of the law of\r\nthe equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have obtained\r\na physical interpretation of this law.\r\n\r\nFrom our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general\r\ntheory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of\r\ngravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general\r\nidea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the gravitational\r\nfield. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn the reader\r\nagainst a misconception suggested by these considerations. A\r\ngravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the fact\r\nthat there was no such field for the co-ordinate system first chosen.\r\nNow we might easily suppose that the existence of a gravitational field\r\nis always only an _apparent_ one. We might also think that, regardless\r\nof the kind of gravitational field which may be present, we could\r\nalways choose another reference-body such that _no_ gravitational field\r\nexists with reference to it. This is by no means true for all\r\ngravitational fields, but only for those of quite special form. It is,\r\nfor instance, impossible to choose a body of reference such that, as\r\njudged from it, the gravitational field of the earth (in its entirety)\r\nvanishes.\r\n\r\nWe can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we\r\nbrought forward against the general principle of relativity at the end\r\nof Section XVIII. It is certainly true that the observer in the railway\r\ncarriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the application of\r\nthe brake, and that he recognises, in this the non-uniformity of motion\r\n(retardation) of the carriage. But he is compelled by nobody to refer\r\nthis jerk to a “real” acceleration (retardation) of the carriage. He\r\nmight also interpret his experience thus: “My body of reference (the\r\ncarriage) remains permanently at rest. With reference to it, however,\r\nthere exists (during the period of application of the brakes) a\r\ngravitational field which is directed forwards and which is variable\r\nwith respect to time. Under the influence of this field, the embankment\r\ntogether with the earth moves non-uniformly in such a manner that their\r\noriginal velocity in the backwards direction is continuously reduced.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nIN WHAT RESPECTS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND OF THE\r\nSPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY UNSATISFACTORY?\r\n\r\nWe have already stated several times that classical mechanics starts\r\nout from the following law: Material particles sufficiently far removed\r\nfrom other material particles continue to move uniformly in a straight\r\nline or continue in a state of rest. We have also repeatedly emphasised\r\nthat this fundamental law can only be valid for bodies of reference _K_\r\nwhich possess certain unique states of motion, and which are in uniform\r\ntranslational motion relative to each other. Relative to other\r\nreference-bodies _K_ the law is not valid. Both in classical mechanics\r\nand in the special theory of relativity we therefore differentiate\r\nbetween reference-bodies _K_ relative to which the recognised “laws of\r\nnature” can be said to hold, and reference-bodies _K_ relative to which\r\nthese laws do not hold.\r\n\r\nBut no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisfied with\r\nthis condition of things. He asks: “How does it come that certain\r\nreference-bodies (or their states of motion) are given priority over\r\nother reference-bodies (or their states of motion)? _What is the reason\r\nfor this preference?_” In order to show clearly what I mean by this\r\nquestion, I shall make use of a comparison.\r\n\r\nI am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of each other\r\non the range are two pans so much alike that one may be mistaken for\r\nthe other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is being\r\nemitted continuously from the one pan, but not from the other. I am\r\nsurprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or a\r\npan before. But if I now notice a luminous something of bluish colour\r\nunder the first pan but not under the other, I cease to be astonished,\r\neven if I have never before seen a gas flame. For I can only say that\r\nthis bluish something will cause the emission of the steam, or at least\r\n_possibly_ it may do so. If, however, I notice the bluish something in\r\nneither case, and if I observe that the one continuously emits steam\r\nwhilst the other does not, then I shall remain astonished and\r\ndissatisfied until I have discovered some circumstance to which I can\r\nattribute the different behaviour of the two pans.\r\n\r\nAnalogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical mechanics\r\n(or in the special theory of relativity) to which I can attribute the\r\ndifferent behaviour of bodies considered with respect to the reference\r\nsystems _K_ and _K′_.[15] Newton saw this objection and attempted to\r\ninvalidate it, but without success. But E. Mach recognised it most\r\nclearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that mechanics\r\nmust be placed on a new basis. It can only be got rid of by means of a\r\nphysics which is conformable to the general principle of relativity,\r\nsince the equations of such a theory hold for every body of reference,\r\nwhatever may be its state of motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] The objection is of importance more especially when the state of\r\n motion of the reference-body is of such a nature that it does not\r\n require any external agency for its maintenance, _e.g._ in the case\r\n when the reference-body is rotating uniformly.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nA FEW INFERENCES FROM THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nThe considerations of Section XX show that the general principle of\r\nrelativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the\r\ngravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, for\r\ninstance, that we know the space-time “course” for any natural process\r\nwhatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in the\r\nGalileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference _K_. By\r\nmeans of purely theoretical operations (_i.e._ simply by calculation)\r\nwe are then able to find how this known natural process appears, as\r\nseen from a reference-body _K′_ which is accelerated relatively to _K_.\r\nBut since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of\r\nreference _K′_, our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational\r\nfield influences the process studied.\r\n\r\nFor example, we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform\r\nrectilinear motion with respect to _K_ (in accordance with the law of\r\nGalilei) is executing an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion\r\nwith respect to the accelerated reference-body _K′_ (chest). This\r\nacceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving\r\nbody of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to _K_. It is\r\nknown that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in\r\nthis way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing\r\nessentially new.\r\n\r\nHowever, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we carry\r\nout the analogous consideration for a ray of light. With respect to the\r\nGalileian reference-body _K_, such a ray of light is transmitted\r\nrectilinearly with the velocity _c_. It can easily be shown that the\r\npath of the same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we\r\nconsider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body\r\n_K′_). From this we conclude, _that, in general, rays of light are\r\npropagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields._ In two respects this\r\nresult is of great importance.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it can be compared with the reality. Although a\r\ndetailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light\r\nrays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly\r\nsmall for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its\r\nestimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing incidence\r\nis nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest itself in\r\nthe following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed stars appear\r\nto be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus capable of\r\nobservation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such times, these\r\nstars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an\r\namount indicated above, as compared with their apparent position in the\r\nsky when the sun is situated at another part of the heavens. The\r\nexamination of the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a\r\nproblem of the greatest importance, the early solution of which is to\r\nbe expected of astronomers.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n [16] By means of the star photographs of two expeditions equipped by a\r\n Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies, the\r\n existence of the deflection of light demanded by theory was first\r\n confirmed during the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. (Cf. Appendix\r\n III.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second place our result shows that, according to the general\r\ntheory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light\r\nin vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in\r\nthe special theory of relativity and to which we have already\r\nfrequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature\r\nof rays of light can only take place when the velocity of propagation\r\nof light varies with position. Now we might think that as a consequence\r\nof this, the special theory of relativity and with it the whole theory\r\nof relativity would be laid in the dust. But in reality this is not the\r\ncase. We can only conclude that the special theory of relativity cannot\r\nclaim an unlimited domain of validity; its results hold only so long as\r\nwe are able to disregard the influences of gravitational fields on the\r\nphenomena (_e.g._ of light).\r\n\r\nSince it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of\r\nrelativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the\r\ngeneral theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to make the facts\r\nof the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison. Before the\r\ndevelopment of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics were looked\r\nupon as the laws of electricity. At the present time we know that\r\nelectric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic\r\nconsiderations only for the case, which is never strictly realised, in\r\nwhich the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each other,\r\nand to the co-ordinate system. Should we be justified in saying that\r\nfor this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the field-equations of\r\nMaxwell in electrodynamics? Not in the least. Electrostatics is\r\ncontained in electrodynamics as a limiting case; the laws of the latter\r\nlead directly to those of the former for the case in which the fields\r\nare invariable with regard to time. No fairer destiny could be allotted\r\nto any physical theory, than that it should of itself point out the way\r\nto the introduction of a more comprehensive theory, in which it lives\r\non as a limiting case.\r\n\r\nIn the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have\r\nseen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive\r\ntheoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of\r\nnatural processes, the laws of which are already known when a\r\ngravitational field is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the\r\nsolution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key,\r\nconcerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational\r\nfield itself. Let us consider this for a moment.\r\n\r\nWe are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately)\r\nin a “Galileian” fashion under suitable choice of reference-body,\r\n_i.e._ domains in which gravitational fields are absent. If we now\r\nrefer such a domain to a reference-body _K′_ possessing any kind of\r\nmotion, then relative to _K′_ there exists a gravitational field which\r\nis variable with respect to space and time.[17] The character of this\r\nfield will of course depend on the motion chosen for _K′._ According to\r\nthe general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitational\r\nfield must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in this\r\nway. Even though by no means all gravitationial fields can be produced\r\nin this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general law of\r\ngravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of a\r\nspecial kind. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful manner.\r\nBut between the clear vision of this goal and its actual realisation it\r\nwas necessary to surmount a serious difficulty, and as this lies deep\r\nat the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the reader. We\r\nrequire to extend our ideas of the space-time continuum still farther.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] This follows from a generalisation of the discussion in Section\r\n XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nBEHAVIOUR OF CLOCKS AND MEASURING-RODS ON A ROTATING BODY OF REFERENCE\r\n\r\nHitherto I have purposely refrained from speaking about the physical\r\ninterpretation of space- and time-data in the case of the general\r\ntheory of relativity. As a consequence, I am guilty of a certain\r\nslovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the special theory of\r\nrelativity, is far from being unimportant and pardonable. It is now\r\nhigh time that we remedy this defect; but I would mention at the\r\noutset, that this matter lays no small claims on the patience and on\r\nthe power of abstraction of the reader.\r\n\r\nWe start off again from quite special cases, which we have frequently\r\nused before. Let us consider a space time domain in which no\r\ngravitational field exists relative to a reference-body _K_ whose state\r\nof motion has been suitably chosen. _K_ is then a Galileian\r\nreference-body as regards the domain considered, and the results of the\r\nspecial theory of relativity hold relative to _K_. Let us suppose the\r\nsame domain referred to a second body of reference _K′_, which is\r\nrotating uniformly with respect to _K_. In order to fix our ideas, we\r\nshall imagine _K′_ to be in the form of a plane circular disc, which\r\nrotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer who is\r\nsitting eccentrically on the disc _K′_ is sensible of a force which\r\nacts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as\r\nan effect of inertia (centrifugal force) by an observer who was at rest\r\nwith respect to the original reference-body _K_. But the observer on\r\nthe disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is “at rest”; on\r\nthe basis of the general principle of relativity he is justified in\r\ndoing this. The force acting on himself, and in fact on all other\r\nbodies which are at rest relative to the disc, he regards as the effect\r\nof a gravitational field. Nevertheless, the space-distribution of this\r\ngravitational field is of a kind that would not be possible on Newton’s\r\ntheory of gravitation.[18] But since the observer believes in the\r\ngeneral theory of relativity, this does not disturb him; he is quite in\r\nthe right when he believes that a general law of gravitation can be\r\nformulated—a law which not only explains the motion of the stars\r\ncorrectly, but also the field of force experienced by himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n [18] The field disappears at the centre of the disc and increases\r\n proportionally to the distance from the centre as we proceed outwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observer performs experiments on his circular disc with clocks and\r\nmeasuring-rods. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact\r\ndefinitions for the signification of time- and space-data with\r\nreference to the circular disc _K′_, these definitions being based on\r\nhis observations. What will be his experience in this enterprise?\r\n\r\nTo start with, he places one of two identically constructed clocks at\r\nthe centre of the circular disc, and the other on the edge of the disc,\r\nso that they are at rest relative to it. We now ask ourselves whether\r\nboth clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the non-rotating\r\nGalileian reference-body _K_. As judged from this body, the clock at\r\nthe centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at the edge\r\nof the disc is in motion relative to _K_ in consequence of the\r\nrotation. According to a result obtained in Section XII, it follows\r\nthat the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of\r\nthe clock at the centre of the circular disc, _i.e._ as observed from\r\n_K_. It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer\r\nwhom we will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the\r\ncircular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the case more\r\ngeneral, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or\r\nless quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated\r\n(at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable\r\ndefinition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest\r\nwith respect to the body of reference. A similar difficulty presents\r\nitself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity\r\nin such a case, but I do not wish to go any farther into this question.\r\n\r\nMoreover, at this stage the definition of the space co-ordinates also\r\npresents insurmountable difficulties. If the observer applies his\r\nstandard measuring-rod (a rod which is short as compared with the\r\nradius of the disc) tangentially to the edge of the disc, then, as\r\njudged from the Galileian system, the length of this rod will be less\r\nthan 1, since, according to Section XII, moving bodies suffer a\r\nshortening in the direction of the motion. On the other hand, the\r\nmeasuring-rod will not experience a shortening in length, as judged\r\nfrom _K_, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius.\r\nIf, then, the observer first measures the circumference of the disc\r\nwith his measuring-rod and then the diameter of the disc, on dividing\r\nthe one by the other, he will not obtain as quotient the familiar\r\nnumber π = 3.14 . . ., but a larger number,[19] whereas of course, for\r\na disc which is at rest with respect to _K_, this operation would yield\r\nπ exactly. This proves that the propositions of Euclidean geometry\r\ncannot hold exactly on the rotating disc, nor in general in a\r\ngravitational field, at least if we attribute the length 1 to the rod\r\nin all positions and in every orientation. Hence the idea of a straight\r\nline also loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a position to\r\ndefine exactly the co-ordinates _x, y, z_ relative to the disc by means\r\nof the method used in discussing the special theory, and as long as the\r\nco-ordinates and times of events have not been defined, we cannot\r\nassign an exact meaning to the natural laws in which these occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n [19] Throughout this consideration we have to use the Galileian\r\n (non-rotating) system _K_ as reference-body, since we may only assume\r\n the validity of the results of the special theory of relativity\r\n relative to _K_ (relative to _K′_ a gravitational field prevails).\r\n\r\n\r\nThus all our previous conclusions based on general relativity would\r\nappear to be called in question. In reality we must make a subtle\r\ndetour in order to be able to apply the postulate of general relativity\r\nexactly. I shall prepare the reader for this in the following\r\nparagraphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nEUCLIDEAN AND NON-EUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM\r\n\r\nThe surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. I can get\r\nfrom any one point on this table to any other point by passing\r\ncontinuously from one point to a “neighbouring” one, and repeating this\r\nprocess a (large) number of times, or, in other words, by going from\r\npoint to point without executing “jumps.” I am sure the reader will\r\nappreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by “neighbouring”\r\nand by “jumps” (if he is not too pedantic). We express this property of\r\nthe surface by describing the latter as a continuum.\r\n\r\nLet us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length\r\nhave been made, their lengths being small compared with the dimensions\r\nof the marble slab. When I say they are of equal length, I mean that\r\none can be laid on any other without the ends overlapping. We next lay\r\nfour of these little rods on the marble slab so that they constitute a\r\nquadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of which are equally\r\nlong. To ensure the equality of the diagonals, we make use of a little\r\ntesting-rod. To this square we add similar ones, each of which has one\r\nrod in common with the first. We proceed in like manner with each of\r\nthese squares until finally the whole marble slab is laid out with\r\nsquares. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs to\r\ntwo squares and each corner to four squares.\r\n\r\nIt is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without\r\ngetting into the greatest difficulties. We only need to think of the\r\nfollowing. If at any moment three squares meet at a corner, then two\r\nsides of the fourth square are already laid, and, as a consequence, the\r\narrangement of the remaining two sides of the square is already\r\ncompletely determined. But I am now no longer able to adjust the\r\nquadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal. If they are equal of\r\ntheir own accord, then this is an especial favour of the marble slab\r\nand of the little rods, about which I can only be thankfully surprised.\r\nWe must experience many such surprises if the construction is to be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIf everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that the points of\r\nthe marble slab constitute a Euclidean continuum with respect to the\r\nlittle rod, which has been used as a “distance” (line-interval). By\r\nchoosing one corner of a square as “origin” I can characterise every\r\nother corner of a square with reference to this origin by means of two\r\nnumbers. I only need state how many rods I must pass over when,\r\nstarting from the origin, I proceed towards the “right” and then\r\n“upwards,” in order to arrive at the corner of the square under\r\nconsideration. These two numbers are then the “Cartesian co-ordinates”\r\nof this corner with reference to the “Cartesian co-ordinate system”\r\nwhich is determined by the arrangement of little rods.\r\n\r\nBy making use of the following modification of this abstract\r\nexperiment, we recognise that there must also be cases in which the\r\nexperiment would be unsuccessful. We shall suppose that the rods\r\n“expand” by in amount proportional to the increase of temperature. We\r\nheat the central part of the marble slab, but not the periphery, in\r\nwhich case two of our little rods can still be brought into coincidence\r\nat every position on the table. But our construction of squares must\r\nnecessarily come into disorder during the heating, because the little\r\nrods on the central region of the table expand, whereas those on the\r\nouter part do not.\r\n\r\nWith reference to our little rods—defined as unit lengths—the marble\r\nslab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and we are also no longer in\r\nthe position of defining Cartesian co-ordinates directly with their\r\naid, since the above construction can no longer be carried out. But\r\nsince there are other things which are not influenced in a similar\r\nmanner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the temperature of\r\nthe table, it is possible quite naturally to maintain the point of view\r\nthat the marble slab is a “Euclidean continuum.” This can be done in a\r\nsatisfactory manner by making a more subtle stipulation about the\r\nmeasurement or the comparison of lengths.\r\n\r\nBut if rods of every kind (_i.e._ of every material) were to behave _in\r\nthe same way_ as regards the influence of temperature when they are on\r\nthe variably heated marble slab, and if we had no other means of\r\ndetecting the effect of temperature than the geometrical behaviour of\r\nour rods in experiments analogous to the one described above, then our\r\nbest plan would be to assign the distance one to two points on the\r\nslab, provided that the ends of one of our rods could be made to\r\ncoincide with these two points; for how else should we define the\r\ndistance without our proceeding being in the highest measure grossly\r\narbitrary? The method of Cartesian coordinates must then be discarded,\r\nand replaced by another which does not assume the validity of Euclidean\r\ngeometry for rigid bodies.[20] The reader will notice that the\r\nsituation depicted here corresponds to the one brought about by the\r\ngeneral postulate of relativity (Section XXIII).\r\n\r\n\r\n [20] Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the\r\n following form. If we are given a surface (_e.g._ an ellipsoid) in\r\n Euclidean three-dimensional space, then there exists for this surface\r\n a two-dimensional geometry, just as much as for a plane surface. Gauss\r\n undertook the task of treating this two-dimensional geometry from\r\n first principles, without making use of the fact that the surface\r\n belongs to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we imagine\r\n constructions to be made with rigid rods _in the surface_ (similar to\r\n that above with the marble slab), we should find that different laws\r\n hold for these from those resulting on the basis of Euclidean plane\r\n geometry. The surface is not a Euclidean continuum with respect to the\r\n rods, and we cannot define Cartesian co-ordinates _in the surface_.\r\n Gauss indicated the principles according to which we can treat the\r\n geometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed out the way\r\n to the method of Riemann of treating multi-dimensional, non-Euclidean\r\n _continuum_. Thus it is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal\r\n problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\nGAUSSIAN CO-ORDINATES\r\n\r\nimage033\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Gauss, this combined analytical and geometrical mode of\r\nhandling the problem can be arrived at in the following way. We imagine\r\na system of arbitrary curves (see Fig. 4) drawn on the surface of the\r\ntable. These we designate as _u_-curves, and we indicate each of them\r\nby means of a number. The Curves _u_ = 1, _u_ = 2 and _u_ = 3 are drawn\r\nin the diagram. Between the curves _u_ = 1 and _u_ = 2 we must imagine\r\nan infinitely large number to be drawn, all of which correspond to real\r\nnumbers lying between 1 and 2. We have then a system of _u_-curves, and\r\nthis “infinitely dense” system covers the whole surface of the table.\r\nThese _u_-curves must not intersect each other, and through each point\r\nof the surface one and only one curve must pass. Thus a perfectly\r\ndefinite value of _u_ belongs to every point on the surface of the\r\nmarble slab. In like manner we imagine a system of _v_-curves drawn on\r\nthe surface. These satisfy the same conditions as the _u_-curves, they\r\nare provided with numbers in a corresponding manner, and they may\r\nlikewise be of arbitrary shape. It follows that a value of _u_ and a\r\nvalue of _v_ belong to every point on the surface of the table. We call\r\nthese two numbers the co-ordinates of the surface of the table\r\n(Gaussian co-ordinates). For example, the point _P_ in the diagram has\r\nthe Gaussian co-ordinates _u_ = 3, _v_ = 1. Two neighbouring points _P_\r\nand _P′_ on the surface then correspond to the co-ordinates\r\n\r\n_P_: _u, v_\r\n\r\n_P′_: _u_ + _du, v_ + _dv_,\r\n\r\nwhere _du_ and _dv_ signify very small numbers. In a similar manner we\r\nmay indicate the distance (line-interval) between _P_ and _P′_, as\r\nmeasured with a little rod, by means of the very small number _ds_.\r\nThen according to Gauss we have\r\n\r\n_ds_2 = _g_11_du_2 + 2_g_12_du dv_ + _g_22_dv_2,\r\n\r\nwhere _g_11, _g_12, _g_22, are magnitudes which depend in a perfectly\r\ndefinite way on _u_ and _v_. The magnitudes _g_11, _g_12 and _g_22,\r\ndetermine the behaviour of the rods relative to the _u_-curves and\r\n_v_-curves, and thus also relative to the surface of the table. For the\r\ncase in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean\r\ncontinuum with reference to the measuring-rods, but only in this case,\r\nit is possible to draw the _u_-curves and _v_-curves and to attach\r\nnumbers to them, in such a manner, that we simply have:\r\n\r\n_ds_2 = _du_2 + _dv_2\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, the _u_-curves and _v_-curves are straight\r\nlines in the sense of Euclidean geometry, and they are perpendicular to\r\neach other. Here the Gaussian coordinates are simply Cartesian ones. It\r\nis clear that Gauss co-ordinates are nothing more than an association\r\nof two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considered, of\r\nsuch a nature that numerical values differing very slightly from each\r\nother are associated with neighbouring points “in space.”\r\n\r\nSo far, these considerations hold for a continuum of two dimensions.\r\nBut the Gaussian method can be applied also to a continuum of three,\r\nfour or more dimensions. If, for instance, a continuum of four\r\ndimensions be supposed available, we may represent it in the following\r\nway. With every point of the continuum, we associate arbitrarily four\r\nnumbers, _x_1, _x_2, _x_3, _x_4, which are known as “co-ordinates.”\r\nAdjacent points correspond to adjacent values of the coordinates. If a\r\ndistance _ds_ is associated with the adjacent points _P_ and _P′_, this\r\ndistance being measurable and well defined from a physical point of\r\nview, then the following formula holds:\r\n\r\n_ds_2 = _g_11_dx_12 + 2_g_12_dx_1_dx_2 . . . . + _g_44_dx_42,\r\n\r\nwhere the magnitudes _g_11, etc., have values which vary with the\r\nposition in the continuum. Only when the continuum is a Euclidean one\r\nis it possible to associate the co-ordinates _x_1 . . _x_4. with the\r\npoints of the continuum so that we have simply\r\n\r\n_ds_2 = _dx_12 + _dx_22 + _dx_32 + _dx_42.\r\n\r\nIn this case relations hold in the four-dimensional continuum which are\r\nanalogous to those holding in our three-dimensional measurements.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Gauss treatment for _ds_2 which we have given above is not\r\nalways possible. It is only possible when sufficiently small regions of\r\nthe continuum under consideration may be regarded as Euclidean\r\ncontinua. For example, this obviously holds in the case of the marble\r\nslab of the table and local variation of temperature. The temperature\r\nis practically constant for a small part of the slab, and thus the\r\ngeometrical behaviour of the rods is _almost_ as it ought to be\r\naccording to the rules of Euclidean geometry. Hence the imperfections\r\nof the construction of squares in the previous section do not show\r\nthemselves clearly until this construction is extended over a\r\nconsiderable portion of the surface of the table.\r\n\r\nWe can sum this up as follows: Gauss invented a method for the\r\nmathematical treatment of continua in general, in which\r\n“size-relations” (“distances” between neighbouring points) are defined.\r\nTo every point of a continuum are assigned as many numbers (Gaussian\r\ncoordinates) as the continuum has dimensions. This is done in such a\r\nway, that only one meaning can be attached to the assignment, and that\r\nnumbers (Gaussian coordinates) which differ by an indefinitely small\r\namount are assigned to adjacent points. The Gaussian coordinate system\r\nis a logical generalisation of the Cartesian co-ordinate system. It is\r\nalso applicable to non-Euclidean continua, but only when, with respect\r\nto the defined “size” or “distance,” small parts of the continuum under\r\nconsideration behave more nearly like a Euclidean system, the smaller\r\nthe part of the continuum under our notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM OF THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY CONSIDERED\r\nAS A EUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of\r\nMinkowski, which was only vaguely indicated in Section XVII. In\r\naccordance with the special theory of relativity, certain co-ordinate\r\nsystems are given preference for the description of the\r\nfour-dimensional, space-time continuum. We called these “Galileian\r\nco-ordinate systems.” For these systems, the four co-ordinates _x, y,\r\nz, t_, which determine an event or—in other words—a point of the\r\nfour-dimensional continuum, are defined physically in a simple manner,\r\nas set forth in detail in the first part of this book. For the\r\ntransition from one Galileian system to another, which is moving\r\nuniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz\r\ntransformation are valid. These last form the basis for the derivation\r\nof deductions from the special theory of relativity, and in themselves\r\nthey are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of\r\nthe law of transmission of light for all Galileian systems of\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nMinkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following\r\nsimple conditions. Let us consider two neighbouring events, the\r\nrelative position of which in the four-dimensional continuum is given\r\nwith respect to a Galileian reference-body _K_ by the space co-ordinate\r\ndifferences _dx, dy, dz_ and the time-difference _dt_. With reference\r\nto a second Galileian system we shall suppose that the corresponding\r\ndifferences for these two events are _dx′, dy′, dz′, dt′_. Then these\r\nmagnitudes always fulfill the condition.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] Cf. Appendixes I and II. The relations which are derived there\r\n for the co-ordinates themselves are valid also for co-ordinate\r\n _differences_, and thus also for co-ordinate differentials\r\n (indefinitely small differences).\r\n\r\n\r\n_dx_2 + _dy_2 + _dz_2 – _c_2_dt_2 = _dx′_2 + _dy′_2 + _dz′_2 –\r\n_c_2_dt′_2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this condition.\r\nWe can express this as follows: The magnitude\r\n\r\n_ds_2 = _dx_2 + _dy_2 + _dz_2 – _c_2 _dt_2,\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich belongs to two adjacent points of the four-dimensional space-time\r\ncontinuum, has the same value for all selected (Galileian)\r\nreference-bodies. If we replace _x, y, z_,\r\n\r\nimage034\r\n\r\n\r\nby _x_1, _x_2, _x_3, _x_4, we also obtain the result that\r\n\r\n_ds_2 = _dx_12 + _dx_22 + _dx_32 + _dx_42.\r\n\r\n\r\nis independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call the\r\nmagnitude _ds_ the “distance” apart of the two events or\r\nfour-dimensional points.\r\n\r\nThus, if we choose as time-variable the imaginary variable\r\n\r\nimage035\r\n\r\n\r\ninstead of the real quantity _t_, we can regard the space-time\r\ncontintium—accordance with the special theory of relativity—as a\r\n“Euclidean” four-dimensional continuum, a result which follows from the\r\nconsiderations of the preceding section.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY IS NOT A\r\nEUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this book we were able to make use of space-time\r\nco-ordinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical\r\ninterpretation, and which, according to Section XXVI, can be regarded\r\nas four-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. This was possible on the\r\nbasis of the law of the constancy of the velocity of light. But\r\naccording to Section XXI the general theory of relativity cannot retain\r\nthis law. On the contrary, we arrived at the result that according to\r\nthis latter theory the velocity of light must always depend on the\r\nco-ordinates when a gravitational field is present. In connection with\r\na specific illustration in Section XXIII, we found that the presence of\r\na gravitational field invalidates the definition of the coordinates and\r\nthe time, which led us to our objective in the special theory of\r\nrelativity.\r\n\r\nIn view of the resuIts of these considerations we are led to the\r\nconviction that, according to the general principle of relativity, the\r\nspace-time continuum cannot be regarded as a Euclidean one, but that\r\nhere we have the general case, corresponding to the marble slab with\r\nlocal variations of temperature, and with which we made acquaintance as\r\nan example of a two-dimensional continuum. Just as it was there\r\nimpossible to construct a Cartesian co-ordinate system from equal rods,\r\nso here it is impossible to build up a system (reference-body) from\r\nrigid bodies and clocks, which shall be of such a nature that\r\nmeasuring-rods and clocks, arranged rigidly with respect to one\r\nanother, shall indicate position and time directly. Such was the\r\nessence of the difficulty with which we were confronted in Section\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nBut the considerations of Sections XXV and XXVI show us the way to\r\nsurmount this difficulty. We refer the four-dimensional space-time\r\ncontinuum in an arbitrary manner to Gauss co-ordinates. We assign to\r\nevery point of the continuum (event) four numbers, _x_1, _x_2, _x_3,\r\n_x_4 (co-ordinates), which have not the least direct physical\r\nsignificance, but only serve the purpose of numbering the points of the\r\ncontinuum in a definite but arbitrary manner. This arrangement does not\r\neven need to be of such a kind that we must regard _x_1, _x_2, _x_3, as\r\n“space” co-ordinates and _x_4, as a “time” co-ordinate.\r\n\r\nThe reader may think that such a description of the world would be\r\nquite inadequate. What does it mean to assign to an event the\r\nparticular co-ordinates _x_1, _x_2, _x_3, _x_4, if in themselves these\r\nco-ordinates have no significance? More careful consideration shows,\r\nhowever, that this anxiety is unfounded. Let us consider, for instance,\r\na material point with any kind of motion. If this point had only a\r\nmomentary existence without duration, then it would to described in\r\nspace-time by a single system of values _x_1, _x_2, _x_3, _x_4. Thus\r\nits permanent existence must be characterised by an infinitely large\r\nnumber of such systems of values, the co-ordinate values of which are\r\nso close together as to give continuity; corresponding to the material\r\npoint, we thus have a (uni-dimensional) line in the four-dimensional\r\ncontinuum. In the same way, any such lines in our continuum correspond\r\nto many points in motion. The only statements having regard to these\r\npoints which can claim a physical existence are in reality the\r\nstatements about their encounters. In our mathematical treatment, such\r\nan encounter is expressed in the fact that the two lines which\r\nrepresent the motions of the points in question have a particular\r\nsystem of co-ordinate values, _x_1, _x_2, _x_3, _x_4, in common. After\r\nmature consideration the reader will doubtless admit that in reality\r\nsuch encounters constitute the only actual evidence of a time-space\r\nnature with which we meet in physical statements.\r\n\r\nWhen we were describing the motion of a material point relative to a\r\nbody of reference, we stated nothing more than the encounters of this\r\npoint with particular points of the reference-body. We can also\r\ndetermine the corresponding values of the time by the observation of\r\nencounters of the body with clocks, in conjunction with the observation\r\nof the encounter of the hands of clocks with particular points on the\r\ndials. It is just the same in the case of space-measurements by means\r\nof measuring-rods, as a little consideration will show.\r\n\r\nThe following statements hold generally: Every physical description\r\nresolves itself into a number of statements, each of which refers to\r\nthe space-time coincidence of two events _A_ and _B_. In terms of\r\nGaussian co-ordinates, every such statement is expressed by the\r\nagreement of their four co-ordinates _x_1, _x_2, _x_3, _x_4. Thus in\r\nreality, the description of the time-space continuum by means of Gauss\r\nco-ordinates completely replaces the description with the aid of a body\r\nof reference, without suffering from the defects of the latter mode of\r\ndescription; it is not tied down to the Euclidean character of the\r\ncontinuum which has to be represented.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\nEXACT FORMULATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to replace the provisional formulation of the\r\ngeneral principle of relativity given in Section XVIII by an exact\r\nformulation. The form there used, “All bodies of reference _K, K′_,\r\netc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena\r\n(formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their\r\nstate of motion,” cannot be maintained, because the use of rigid\r\nreference-bodies, in the sense of the method followed in the special\r\ntheory of relativity, is in general not possible in space-time\r\ndescription. The Gauss co-ordinate system has to take the place of the\r\nbody of reference. The following statement corresponds to the\r\nfundamental idea of the general principle of relativity: “_All Gaussian\r\nco-ordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of\r\nthe general laws of nature._”\r\n\r\nWe can state this general principle of relativity in still another\r\nform, which renders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is when in\r\nthe form of the natural extension of the special principle of\r\nrelativity. According to the special theory of relativity, the\r\nequations which express the general laws of nature pass over into\r\nequations of the same form when, by making use of the Lorentz\r\ntransformation, we replace the space-time variables _x, y, z, t_, of a\r\n(Galileian) reference-body _K_ by the space-time variables _x′, y′, z′,\r\nt′_, of a new reference-body _K′_. According to the general theory of\r\nrelativity, on the other hand, by application of _arbitrary\r\nsubstitutions_ of the Gauss variables _x_1, _x_2, _x_3, _x_4, the\r\nequations must pass over into equations of the same form; for every\r\ntransformation (not only the Lorentz transformation) corresponds to the\r\ntransition of one Gauss co-ordinate system into another.\r\n\r\nIf we desire to adhere to our “old-time” three-dimensional view of\r\nthings, then we can characterise the development which is being\r\nundergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity\r\nas follows: The special theory of relativity has reference to Galileian\r\ndomains, _i.e._ to those in which no gravitational field exists. In\r\nthis connection a Galileian reference-body serves as body of reference,\r\n_i.e._ a rigid body the state of motion of which is so chosen that the\r\nGalileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of “isolated” material\r\npoints holds relatively to it.\r\n\r\nCertain considerations suggest that we should refer the same Galileian\r\ndomains to _non-Galileian_ reference-bodies also. A gravitational field\r\nof a special kind is then present with respect to these bodies (cf.\r\nSections XX and XXIII).\r\n\r\nIn gravitational fields there are no such things as rigid bodies with\r\nEuclidean properties; thus the fictitious rigid body of reference is of\r\nno avail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of clocks is\r\nalso influenced by gravitational fields, and in such a way that a\r\nphysical definition of time which is made directly with the aid of\r\nclocks has by no means the same degree of plausibility as in the\r\nspecial theory of relativity.\r\n\r\nFor this reason non-rigid reference-bodies are used, which are as a\r\nwhole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer\r\nalterations in form _ad lib._ during their motion. Clocks, for which\r\nthe law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the\r\ndefinition of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a\r\npoint on the non-rigid reference-body. These clocks satisfy only the\r\none condition, that the “readings” which are observed simultaneously on\r\nadjacent clocks (in space) differ from each other by an indefinitely\r\nsmall amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might appropriately\r\nbe termed a “reference-mollusc”, is in the main equivalent to a\r\nGaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system chosen arbitrarily. That\r\nwhich gives the “mollusc” a certain comprehensibility as compared with\r\nthe Gauss co-ordinate system is the (really unjustified) formal\r\nretention of the separate existence of the\r\n\r\nspace co-ordinates as opposed to the time co-ordinate. Every point on\r\nthe mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every material point which\r\nis at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc is\r\nconsidered as reference-body. The general principle of relativity\r\nrequires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with\r\nequal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws of\r\nnature; the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice of\r\nmollusc.\r\n\r\nThe great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies\r\nin the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on the laws of nature\r\nin consequence of what we have seen above.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITATION ON THE BASIS OF THE GENERAL\r\nPRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nIf the reader has followed all our previous considerations, he will\r\nhave no further difficulty in understanding the methods leading to the\r\nsolution of the problem of gravitation.\r\n\r\nWe start off on a consideration of a Galileian domain, _i.e._ a domain\r\nin which there is no gravitational field relative to the Galileian\r\nreference-body _K_. The behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks with\r\nreference to _K_ is known from the special theory of relativity,\r\nlikewise the behaviour of “isolated” material points; the latter move\r\nuniformly and in straight lines.\r\n\r\nNow let us refer this domain to a random Gauss coordinate system or to\r\na “mollusc” as reference-body _K′_. Then with respect to _K′_ there is\r\na gravitational field _G_ (of a particular kind). We learn the\r\nbehaviour of measuring-rods and clocks and also of freely-moving\r\nmaterial points with reference to _K′_ simply by mathematical\r\ntransformation. We interpret this behaviour as the behaviour of\r\nmeasuring-rods, clocks and material points under the influence of the\r\ngravitational field _G_. Hereupon we introduce a hypothesis: that the\r\ninfluence of the gravitational field on measuring-rods, clocks and\r\nfreely-moving material points continues to take place according to the\r\nsame laws, even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is\r\n_not_ derivable from the Galileian special case, simply by means of a\r\ntransformation of co-ordinates.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to investigate the space-time behaviour of the\r\ngravitational field _G_, which was derived from the Galileian special\r\ncase simply by transformation of the coordinates. This behaviour is\r\nformulated in a law, which is always valid, no matter how the\r\nreference-body (mollusc) used in the description may be chosen.\r\n\r\nThis law is not yet the _general_ law of the gravitational field, since\r\nthe gravitational field under consideration is of a special kind. In\r\norder to find out the general law-of-field of gravitation we still\r\nrequire to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above. This can\r\nbe obtained without caprice, however, by taking into consideration the\r\nfollowing demands:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general\r\npostulate of relativity.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) If there is any matter in the domain under consideration, only\r\nits inertial mass, and thus according to Section XV only its energy is\r\nof importance for its effect in exciting a field.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Gravitational field and matter together must satisfy the law of\r\nthe conservation of energy (and of impulse).\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine\r\nthe influence of the gravitational field on the course of all those\r\nprocesses which take place according to known laws when a gravitational\r\nfield is absent _i.e._ which have already been fitted into the frame of\r\nthe special theory of relativity. In this connection we proceed in\r\nprinciple according to the method which has already been explained for\r\nmeasuring-rods, clocks and freely moving material points.\r\n\r\nThe theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general\r\npostulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty; nor in removing\r\nthe defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought to light\r\nin Section XXI; nor in interpreting the empirical law of the equality\r\nof inertial and gravitational mass; but it has also already explained a\r\nresult of observation in astronomy, against which classical mechanics\r\nis powerless.\r\n\r\nIf we confine the application of the theory to the case where the\r\ngravitational fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which all\r\nmasses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities which\r\nare small compared with the velocity of light, we then obtain as a\r\nfirst approximation the Newtonian theory. Thus the latter theory is\r\nobtained here without any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to\r\nintroduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually\r\nattracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of\r\nthe distance between them. If we increase the accuracy of the\r\ncalculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their\r\nappearance, practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test\r\nof observation owing to their smallness.\r\n\r\nWe must draw attention here to one of these deviations. According to\r\nNewton’s theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which\r\nwould permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed\r\nstars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves\r\nand the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if we\r\ncorrect the observed motion of the planets for these two influences,\r\nand if Newton’s theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the\r\norbit of the planet an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the\r\nfixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy,\r\nhas been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision\r\nthat is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation\r\nattainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the\r\nplanet which lies nearest the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has\r\nbeen known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury,\r\nafter it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not\r\nstationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates\r\nexceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the\r\norbital motion. The value obtained for this rotary movement of the\r\norbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured to\r\nbe correct to within a few seconds of arc. This effect can be explained\r\nby means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of hypotheses\r\nwhich have little probability, and which were devised solely for this\r\npurponse.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the general theory of relativity, it is found that the\r\nellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the\r\nmanner indicated above; that for all the planets, with the exception of\r\nMercury, this rotation is too small to be detected with the delicacy of\r\nobservation possible at the present time; but that in the case of\r\nMercury it must amount to 43 seconds of arc per century, a result which\r\nis strictly in agreement with observation.\r\n\r\nApart from this one, it has hitherto been possible to make only two\r\ndeductions from the theory which admit of being tested by observation,\r\nto wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the\r\nsun,[22] and a displacement of the spectral lines of light reaching us\r\nfrom large stars, as compared with the corresponding lines for light\r\nproduced in an analogous manner terrestrially (_i.e._ by the same kind\r\nof atom).[23] These two deductions from the theory have both been\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n [22] First observed by Eddington and others in 1919. (Cf. Appendix\r\n III).\r\n\r\n\r\n [23] Established by Adams in 1924. (Cf. p. 132)\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III: CONSIDERATIONS ON THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.\r\n\r\nCOSMOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES OF NEWTON’S THEORY\r\n\r\nPart from the difficulty discussed in Section XXI, there is a second\r\nfundamental difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics, which,\r\nto the best of my knowledge, was first discussed in detail by the\r\nastronomer Seeliger. If we ponder over the question as to how the\r\nuniverse, considered as a whole, is to be regarded, the first answer\r\nthat suggests itself to us is surely this: As regards space (and time)\r\nthe universe is infinite. There are stars everywhere, so that the\r\ndensity of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless on\r\nthe average everywhere the same. In other words: However far we might\r\ntravel through space, we should find everywhere an attenuated swarm of\r\nfixed stars of approrimately the same kind and density.\r\n\r\nThis view is not in harmony with the theory of Newton. The latter\r\ntheory rather requires that the universe should have a kind of centre\r\nin which the density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we proceed\r\noutwards from this centre the group-density of the stars should\r\ndiminish, until finally, at great distances, it is succeeded by an\r\ninfinite region of emptiness. The stellar universe ought to be a finite\r\nisland in the infinite ocean of space.[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n [24] _Proof_—According to the theory of Newton, the number of “lines\r\n of force” which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is\r\n proportional to the mass _m_. If, on the average, the mass density ρ0\r\n is constant throughout the universe, then a sphere of volume _V_ will\r\n enclose the average mass ρ0_V_. Thus the number of lines of force\r\n passing through the surface _F_ of the sphere into its interior is\r\n proportional to ρ0_V_. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the\r\n number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional\r\n to ρ0_V/F_ or to ρ0_R_. Hence the intensity of the field at the\r\n surface would ultimately become infinite with increasing radius _R_ of\r\n the sphere, which is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis conception is in itself not very satisfactory. It is still less\r\nsatisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by\r\nthe stars and also individual stars of the stellar system are\r\nperpetually passing out into infinite space, never to return, and\r\nwithout ever again coming into interaction with other objects of\r\nnature. Such a finite material universe would be destined to become\r\ngradually but systematically impoverished.\r\n\r\nIn order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modification of\r\nNewton’s law, in which he assumes that for great distances the force of\r\nattraction between two masses diminishes more rapidly than would result\r\nfrom the inverse square law. In this way it is possible for the mean\r\ndensity of matter to be constant everywhere, even to infinity, without\r\ninfinitely large gravitational fields being produced. We thus free\r\nourselves from the distasteful conception that the material universe\r\nought to possess something of the nature of a centre. Of course we\r\npurchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties mentioned,\r\nat the cost of a modification and complication of Newton’s law which\r\nhas neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can imagine\r\ninnumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without our being\r\nable to state a reason why one of them is to be preferred to the\r\nothers; for any one of these laws would be founded just as little on\r\nmore general theoretical principles as is the law of Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF A “FINITE” AND YET “UNBOUNDED” UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nBut speculations on the structure of the universe also move in quite\r\nanother direction. The development of non-Euclidean geometry led to the\r\nrecognition of the fact, that we can cast doubt on the _infiniteness_\r\nof our space without coming into conflict with the laws of thought or\r\nwith experience (Riemann, Helmholtz). These questions have already been\r\ntreated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by Helmholtz and\r\nPoincaré, whereas I can only touch on them briefly here.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we imagine an existence in two dimensional space.\r\nFlat beings with flat implements, and in particular flat rigid\r\nmeasuring-rods, are free to move in a _plane_. For them nothing exists\r\noutside of this plane: that which they observe to happen to themselves\r\nand to their flat “things” is the all-inclusive reality of their plane.\r\nIn particular, the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry can be\r\ncarried out by means of the rods _e.g._ the lattice construction,\r\nconsidered in Section XXIV. In contrast to ours, the universe of these\r\nbeings is two-dimensional; but, like ours, it extends to infinity. In\r\ntheir universe there is room for an infinite number of identical\r\nsquares made up of rods, _i.e._ its volume (surface) is infinite. If\r\nthese beings say their universe is “plane,” there is sense in the\r\nstatement, because they mean that they can perform the constructions of\r\nplane Euclidean geometry with their rods. In this connection the\r\nindividual rods always represent the same distance, independently of\r\ntheir position.\r\n\r\nLet us consider now a second two-dimensional existence, but this time\r\non a spherical surface instead of on a plane. The flat beings with\r\ntheir measuring-rods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and\r\nthey are unable to leave it. Their whole universe of observation\r\nextends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Are these beings\r\nable to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry\r\nand their rods withal as the realisation of “distance”? They cannot do\r\nthis. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will obtain\r\na curve, which we “three-dimensional beings” designate as a great\r\ncircle, _i.e._ a self-contained line of definite finite length, which\r\ncan be measured up by means of a measuring-rod. Similarly, this\r\nuniverse has a finite area that can be compared with the area, of a\r\nsquare constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this\r\nconsideration lies in the recognition of the fact that _the universe of\r\nthese beings is finite and yet has no limits._\r\n\r\nBut the spherical-surface beings do not need to go on a world-tour in\r\norder to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean universe.\r\nThey can convince themselves of this on every part of their “world,”\r\nprovided they do not use too small a piece of it. Starting from a\r\npoint, they draw “straight lines” (arcs of circles as judged in three\r\ndimensional space) of equal length in all directions. They will call\r\nthe line joining the free ends of these lines a “circle.” For a plane\r\nsurface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter,\r\nboth lengths being measured with the same rod, is, according to\r\nEuclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value π, which is\r\nindependent of the diameter of the circle. On their spherical surface\r\nour flat beings would find for this ratio the value\r\n\r\nimage036\r\n\r\n\r\n_i.e._ a smaller value than π, the difference being the more\r\nconsiderable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison\r\nwith the radius _R_ of the “world-sphere.” By means of this relation\r\nthe spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe\r\n(“world”), even when only a relatively small part of their worldsphere\r\nis available for their measurements. But if this part is very small\r\nindeed, they will no longer be able to demonstrate that they are on a\r\nspherical “world” and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part of a\r\nspherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of the\r\nsame size.\r\n\r\nThus if the spherical surface beings are living on a planet of which\r\nthe solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the spherical\r\nuniverse, they have no means of determining whether they are living in\r\na finite or in an infinite universe, because the “piece of universe” to\r\nwhich they have access is in both cases practically plane, or\r\nEuclidean. It follows directly from this discussion, that for our\r\nsphere-beings the circumference of a circle first increases with the\r\nradius until the “circumference of the universe” is reached, and that\r\nit thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for still further\r\nincreasing values of the radius. During this process the area of the\r\ncircle continues to increase more and more, until finally it becomes\r\nequal to the total area of the whole “world-sphere.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our “beings” on a\r\nsphere rather than on another closed surface. But this choice has its\r\njustification in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is\r\nunique in possessing the property that all points on it are equivalent.\r\nI admit that the ratio of the circumference _c_ of a circle to its\r\nradius _r_ depends on _r_, but for a given value of _r_ it is the same\r\nfor all points of the “worldsphere”; in other words, the “world-sphere”\r\nis a “surface of constant curvature.”\r\n\r\nTo this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a three-dimensional\r\nanalogy, namely, the three-dimensional spherical space which was\r\ndiscovered by Riemann. its points are likewise all equivalent. It\r\npossesses a finite volume, which is determined by its “radius”\r\n(2π2_R_3). Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? To imagine a\r\nspace means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our “space”\r\nexperience, _i.e._ of experience that we can have in the movement of\r\n“rigid” bodies. In this sense we _can_ imagine a spherical space.\r\n\r\nSuppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a\r\npoint, and mark off from each of these the distance _r_ with a\r\nmeasuring-rod. All the free end-points of these lengths lie on a\r\nspherical surface. We can specially measure up the area (_F_) of this\r\nsurface by means of a square made up of measuring-rods. If the universe\r\nis Euclidean, then _F_ = 4π_r_2; if it is spherical, then _F_ is always\r\nless than 4π_r_2. With increasing values of _r, F_ increases from zero\r\nup to a maximum value which is determined by the “world-radius,” but\r\nfor still further increasing values of _r_, the area gradually\r\ndiminishes to zero. At first, the straight lines which radiate from the\r\nstarting point diverge farther and farther from one another, but later\r\nthey approach each other, and finally they run together again at a\r\n“counter-point” to the starting point. Under such conditions they have\r\ntraversed the whole spherical space. It is easily seen that the\r\nthree-dimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the\r\ntwo-dimensional spherical surface. It is finite (_i.e._ of finite\r\nvolume), and has no bounds.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved space:\r\n“elliptical space.” It can be regarded as a curved space in which the\r\ntwo “counter-points” are identical (indistinguishable from each other).\r\nAn elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent as a\r\ncurved universe possessing central symmetry.\r\n\r\nIt follows from what has been said, that closed spaces without limits\r\nare conceivable. From amongst these, the spherical space (and the\r\nelliptical) excels in its simplicity, since all points on it are\r\nequivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting question\r\narises for astronomers and physicists, and that is whether the universe\r\nin which we live is infinite, or whether it is finite in the manner of\r\nthe spherical universe. Our experience is far from being sufficient to\r\nenable us to answer this question. But the general theory of relativity\r\npermits of our answering it with a moderate degree of certainty, and in\r\nthis connection the difficulty mentioned in Section XXX finds its\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nAccording to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical\r\nproperties of space are not independent, but they are determined by\r\nmatter. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geometrical structure of\r\nthe universe only if we base our considerations on the state of the\r\nmatter as being something that is known. We know from experience that,\r\nfor a suitably chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars\r\nare small as compared with the velocity of transmission of light. We\r\ncan thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the\r\nnature of the universe as a whole, if we treat the matter as being at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nWe already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of\r\nmeasuring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields, _i.e._\r\nby the distribution of matter. This in itself is sufficient to exclude\r\nthe possibility of the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our\r\nuniverse. But it is conceivable that our universe differs only slightly\r\nfrom a Euclidean one, and this notion seems all the more probable,\r\nsince calculations show that the metrics of surrounding space is\r\ninfluenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even of the\r\nmagnitude of our sun. We might imagine that, as regards geometry, our\r\nuniverse behaves analogously to a surface which is irregularly curved\r\nin its individual parts, but which nowhere departs appreciably from a\r\nplane: something like the rippled surface of a lake. Such a universe\r\nmight fittingly be called a quasi-Euclidean universe. As regards its\r\nspace it would be infinite. But calculation shows that in a\r\nquasi-Euclidean universe the average density of matter would\r\nnecessarily be _nil_. Thus such a universe could not be inhabited by\r\nmatter everywhere; it would present to us that unsatisfactory picture\r\nwhich we portrayed in Section XXX.\r\n\r\nIf we are to have in the universe an average density of matter which\r\ndiffers from zero, however small may be that difference, then the\r\nuniverse cannot be quasi-Euclidean. On the contrary, the results of\r\ncalculation indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly, the\r\nuniverse would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical). Since in\r\nreality the detailed distribution of matter is not uniform, the real\r\nuniverse will deviate in individual parts from the spherical, _i.e._\r\nthe universe will be quasi-spherical. But it will be necessarily\r\nfinite. In fact, the theory supplies us with a simple connection[25]\r\nbetween the space-expanse of the universe and the average density of\r\nmatter in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n [25] For the radius _R_ of the universe we obtain the equation\r\n\r\n\r\nimage037\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of the C.G.S. system in this equation gives 2/k = 1.08 x 1027;\r\nρ is the average density of the matter and _k_ is a constant connected\r\nwith the Newtonian constant of gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nSIMPLE DERIVATION OF THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION\r\n\r\n(SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION XI)\r\n\r\nFor the relative orientation of the co-ordinate systems indicated in\r\nFig. 2, the _x_-axes of both systems permanently coincide. In the\r\npresent case we can divide the problem into parts by considering first\r\nonly events which are localised on the _x_-axis. Any such event is\r\nrepresented with respect to the co-ordinate system _K_ by the abscissa\r\n_x_ and the time _t_, and with respect to the system _K′_ by the\r\nabscissa _x′_ and the time _t′_. We require to find _x′_ and _t′_ when\r\n_x_ and _t_ are given.\r\n\r\nA light-signal, which is proceeding along the positive axis of _x_, is\r\ntransmitted according to the equation\r\n\r\n_x_ = _ct_\r\n\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n_x_ – _ct_ = 0 . . . . . (1).\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the same light-signal has to be transmitted relative to _K′_ with\r\nthe velocity _c_, the propagation relative to the system _K′_ will be\r\nrepresented by the analogous formula\r\n\r\n_x′_ – _ct′_ = 0 . . . . . (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nThose space-time points (events) which satisfy (1) must also satisfy\r\n(2). Obviously this will be the case when the relation\r\n\r\n(_x′_ – _ct′_) = λ(_x_ – _ct_) . . . (3).\r\n\r\n\r\nis fulfilled in general, where λ indicates a constant; for, according\r\nto (3), the disappearance of (_x_ – _ct_) involves the disappearance of\r\n(_x′_ – _ct′_).\r\n\r\nIf we apply quite similar considerations to light rays which are being\r\ntransmitted along the negative _x_-axis, we obtain the condition\r\n\r\n(_x′_ + _ct′_) = (_x + ct_) . . . (4).\r\n\r\n\r\nBy adding (or subtracting) equations (3) and (4), and introducing for\r\nconvenience the constants _a_ and _b_ in place of the constants λ and μ\r\nwhere\r\n\r\nimage038\r\n\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nimage039\r\n\r\n\r\nwe obtain the equations\r\n\r\nimage040\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should thus have the solution of our problem, if the constants _a_\r\nand _b_ were known. These result from the following discussion.\r\n\r\nFor the origin of _K′_ we have permanently _x′_ = 0, and hence\r\naccording to the first of the equations (5)\r\n\r\nimage041\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we call _v_ the velocity with which the origin of _K′_ is moving\r\nrelative to _K_, we then have\r\n\r\nimage042\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same value _v_ can be obtained from equations (5), if we calculate\r\nthe velocity of another point of _K′_ relative to _K_, or the velocity\r\n(directed towards the negative _x_-axis) of a point of _K_ with respect\r\nto _K′_. In short, we can designate _v_ as the relative velocity of the\r\ntwo systems.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the principle of relativity teaches us that, as judged\r\nfrom K, the length of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest with\r\nreference to _K′_ must be exactly the same as the length, as judged\r\nfrom _K′_, of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest relative to _K_. In\r\norder to see how the points of the _x′_-axis appear as viewed from _K_,\r\nwe only require to take a “snapshot” of _K′_ from _K_; this means that\r\nwe have to insert a particular value of _t_ (time of _K_), _e.g._ _t_ =\r\n0. For this value of _t_ we then obtain from the first of the equations\r\n(5)\r\n\r\n_x′_ = _ax_\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo points of the _x′_-axis which are separated by the distance Δ_x′_ =\r\n1 when measured in the _K′_ system are thus separated in our\r\ninstantaneous photograph by the distance\r\n\r\nimage043\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if the snapshot be taken from _K′_(_t′_ = 0), and if we eliminate\r\n_t_ from the equations (5), taking into account the expression (6), we\r\nobtain\r\n\r\nimage044\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this we conclude that two points on the _x_-axis separated by the\r\ndistance 1 (relative to _K_) will be represented on our snapshot by the\r\ndistance\r\n\r\nimage045\r\n\r\n\r\nBut from what has been said, the two snapshots must be identical; hence\r\nΔ_x_ in (7) must be equal to Δ_x′_ in (7_a_), so that we obtain\r\n\r\nimage046\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equations (6) and (7_b_) determine the constants _a_ and _b_. By\r\ninserting the values of these constants in (5), we obtain the first and\r\nthe fourth of the equations given in Section XI.\r\n\r\nimage047\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we have obtained the Lorentz transformation for events on the\r\n_x_-axis. It satisfies the condition\r\n\r\n_x′_2 – _c_2_t′_2 = _x_2 – _c_2_t_2 . . . . . . (8a).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extension of this result, to include events which take place\r\noutside the _x_-axis, is obtained by retaining equations (8) and\r\nsupplementing them by the relations\r\n\r\nimage048\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity\r\nof light _in vacuo_ for rays of light of arbitrary direction, both for\r\nthe system _K_ and for the system _K′_. This may be shown in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\nWe suppose a light-signal sent out from the origin of _K_ at the time\r\n_t_ = 0. It will be propagated according to the equation\r\n\r\nimage049\r\n\r\n\r\nor, if we square this equation, according to the equation\r\n\r\n_x_2 + _y_2 + _z_2 – _c_2_t_2 = 0 . . . . . (10).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is required by the law of propagation of light, in conjunction with\r\nthe postulate of relativity, that the transmission of the signal in\r\nquestion should take place—as judged from _K′_—in accordance with the\r\ncorresponding formula\r\n\r\n_r′_ = _ct′_\r\n\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n_x′_2 + _y′_2 + _z′_2 – _c_2_t′_2 = 0 . . . . . . (10_a_).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that equation (10_a_) may be a consequence of equation (10),\r\nwe must have\r\n\r\n_x′_2 + _y′_2 + _z′_2 – _c_2_t′_2 = σ (_x_2 + _y_2 + _z_2 – _c_2_t_2)\r\n(11).\r\n\r\n\r\nSince equation (8_a_) must hold for points on the _x_-axis, we thus\r\nhave σ = 1. It is easily seen that the Lorentz transformation really\r\nsatisfies equation (11) for σ = 1; for (11) is a consequence of (8_a_)\r\nand (9), and hence also of (8) and (9). We have thus derived the\r\nLorentz transformation.\r\n\r\nThe Lorentz transformation represented by (8) and (9) still requires to\r\nbe generalised. Obviously it is immaterial whether the axes of _K′_ be\r\nchosen so that they are spatially parallel to those of _K_. It is also\r\nnot essential that the velocity of translation of _K′_ with respect to\r\n_K_ should be in the direction of the _x_-axis. A simple consideration\r\nshows that we are able to construct the Lorentz transformation in this\r\ngeneral sense from two kinds of transformations, viz. from Lorentz\r\ntransformations in the special sense and from purely spatial\r\ntransformations. which corresponds to the replacement of the\r\nrectangular co-ordinate system by a new system with its axes pointing\r\nin other directions.\r\n\r\nMathematically, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz\r\ntransformation thus:\r\n\r\nIt expresses _x′, y′, x′, t′_, in terms of linear homogeneous functions\r\nof _x, y, x, t_, of such a kind that the relation\r\n\r\n_x′_2 + _y′_2 + _z′_2 – _c_2_t′_2 = _x_2 + _y_2 + _z_2 – _c_2_t_2\r\n(11_a_).\r\n\r\n\r\nis satisficd identically. That is to say: If we substitute their\r\nexpressions in _x, y, x, t_, in place of _x′, y′, x′, t′_, on the\r\nleft-hand side, then the left-hand side of (11_a_) agrees with the\r\nright-hand side.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nMINKOWSKI’S FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE (“WORLD”)\r\n\r\n(SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION XVII)\r\n\r\nWe can characterise the Lorentz transformation still more simply if we\r\nintroduce the imaginary\r\n\r\nimage031\r\n\r\n\r\nin place of _t_, as time-variable. If, in accordance with this, we\r\ninsert\r\n\r\nimage050\r\n\r\n\r\nand similarly for the accented system _K′_, then the condition which is\r\nidentically satisfied by the transformation can be expressed thus:\r\n\r\n_x_1′2 + _x_2′2 + _x_3′2 + _x_4′2 = _x_12 + _x_22 + _x_32 + _x_42 (12).\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is, by the afore-mentioned choice of “coordinates,” (11_a_) [see\r\nthe end of Appendix II] is transformed into this equation.\r\n\r\nWe see from (12) that the imaginary time co-ordinate _x_4, enters into\r\nthe condition of transformation in exactly the same way as the space\r\nco-ordinates _x_1, _x_2, _x_3. It is due to this fact that, according\r\nto the theory of relativity, the “time” _x_4, enters into natural laws\r\nin the same form as the space co ordinates _x_1, _x_2, _x_3.\r\n\r\nA four-dimensional continuum described by the “co-ordinates” _x_1,\r\n_x_2, _x_3, _x_4, was called “world” by Minkowski, who also termed a\r\npoint-event a “world-point.” From a “happening” in three-dimensional\r\nspace, physics becomes, as it were, an “existence” in the\r\nfour-dimensional “world.”\r\n\r\nThis four-dimensional “world” bears a close similarity to the\r\nthree-dimensional “space” of (Euclidean) analytical geometry. If we\r\nintroduce into the latter a new Cartesian co-ordinate system (_x′_1,\r\n_x′_2, _x′_3) with the same origin, then _x′_1, _x′_2, _x′_3, are\r\nlinear homogeneous functions of _x_1, _x_2, _x_3 which identically\r\nsatisfy the equation\r\n\r\n_x_1′2 + _x_2′2 + _x_3′2 = _x_12 + _x_22 + _x_32\r\n\r\n\r\nThe analogy with (12) is a complete one. We can regard Minkowski’s\r\n“world” in a formal manner as a four-dimensional Euclidean space (with\r\nan imaginary time coordinate); the Lorentz transformation corresponds\r\nto a “rotation” of the co-ordinate system in the four-dimensional\r\n“world.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nTHE EXPERIMENTAL CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\nFrom a systematic theoretical point of view, we may imagine the process\r\nof evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous process of\r\ninduction. Theories are evolved and are expressed in short compass as\r\nstatements of a large number of individual observations in the form of\r\nempirical laws, from which the general laws can be ascertained by\r\ncomparison. Regarded in this way, the development of a science bears\r\nsome resemblance to the compilation of a classified catalogue. It is,\r\nas it were, a purely empirical enterprise.\r\n\r\nBut this point of view by no means embraces the whole of the actual\r\nprocess; for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and\r\ndeductive thought in the development of an exact science. As soon as a\r\nscience has emerged from its initial stages, theoretical advances are\r\nno longer achieved merely by a process of arrangement. Guided by\r\nempirical data, the investigator rather develops a system of thought\r\nwhich, in general, is built up logically from a small number of\r\nfundamental assumptions, the so-called axioms. We call such a system of\r\nthought a _theory_. The theory finds the justification for its\r\nexistence in the fact that it correlates a large number of single\r\nobservations, and it is just here that the “truth” of the theory lies.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to the same complex of empirical data, there may be\r\nseveral theories, which differ from one another to a considerable\r\nextent. But as regards the deductions from the theories which are\r\ncapable of being tested, the agreement between the theories may be so\r\ncomplete that it becomes difficult to find any deductions in which the\r\ntwo theories differ from each other. As an example, a case of general\r\ninterest is available in the province of biology, in the Darwinian\r\ntheory of the development of species by selection in the struggle for\r\nexistence, and in the theory of development which is based on the\r\nhypothesis of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters.\r\n\r\nWe have another instance of far-reaching agreement between the\r\ndeductions from two theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one hand,\r\nand the general theory of relativity on the other. This agreement goes\r\nso far, that up to the present we have been able to find only a few\r\ndeductions from the general theory of relativity which are capable of\r\ninvestigation, and to which the physics of pre-relativity days does not\r\nalso lead, and this despite the profound difference in the fundamental\r\nassumptions of the two theories. In what follows, we shall again\r\nconsider these important deductions, and we shall also discuss the\r\nempirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Motion of the Perihelion of Mercury\r\n\r\nAccording to Newtonian mechanics and Newton’s law of gravitation, a\r\nplanet which is revolving round the sun would describe an ellipse round\r\nthe latter, or, more correctly, round the common centre of gravity of\r\nthe sun and the planet. In such a system, the sun, or the common centre\r\nof gravity, lies in one of the foci of the orbital ellipse in such a\r\nmanner that, in the course of a planet-year, the distance sun-planet\r\ngrows from a minimum to a maximum, and then decreases again to a\r\nminimum. If instead of Newton’s law we insert a somewhat different law\r\nof attraction into the calculation, we find that, according to this new\r\nlaw, the motion would still take place in such a manner that the\r\ndistance sun-planet exhibits periodic variations; but in this case the\r\nangle described by the line joining sun and planet during such a period\r\n(from perihelion—closest proximity to the sun—to perihelion) would\r\ndiffer from 360°. The line of the orbit would not then be a closed one\r\nbut in the course of time it would fill up an annular part of the\r\norbital plane, viz. between the circle of least and the circle of\r\ngreatest distance of the planet from the sun.\r\n\r\nAccording also to the general theory of relativity, which differs of\r\ncourse from the theory of Newton, a small variation from the\r\nNewton-Kepler motion of a planet in its orbit should take place, and in\r\nsuch away, that the angle described by the radius sun-planet between\r\none perhelion and the next should exceed that corresponding to one\r\ncomplete revolution by an amount given by\r\n\r\nimage051\r\n\r\n\r\n(_N.B._—One complete revolution corresponds to the angle 2π in the\r\nabsolute angular measure customary in physics, and the above expression\r\ngiven the amount by which the radius sun-planet exceeds this angle\r\nduring the interval between one perihelion and the next.) In this\r\nexpression _a_ represents the major semi-axis of the ellipse, _e_ its\r\neccentricity, _c_ the velocity of light, and _T_ the period of\r\nrevolution of the planet. Our result may also be stated as follows:\r\nAccording to the general theory of relativity, the major axis of the\r\nellipse rotates round the sun in the same sense as the orbital motion\r\nof the planet. Theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43\r\nseconds of arc per century for the planet Mercury, but for the other\r\nPlanets of our solar system its magnitude should be so small that it\r\nwould necessarily escape detection.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\n [26] Especially since the next planet Venus has an orbit that is\r\n almost an exact circle, which makes it more difficult to locate the\r\n perihelion with precision.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, astronomers have found that the theory of Newton does\r\nnot suffice to calculate the observed motion of Mercury with an\r\nexactness corresponding to that of the delicacy of observation\r\nattainable at the present time. After taking account of all the\r\ndisturbing influences exerted on Mercury by the remaining planets, it\r\nwas found (Leverrier: 1859; and Newcomb: 1895) that an unexplained\r\nperihelial movement of the orbit of Mercury remained over, the amount\r\nof which does not differ sensibly from the above mentioned +43 seconds\r\nof arc per century. The uncertainty of the empirical result amounts to\r\na few seconds only.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Deflection of Light by a Gravitational Field\r\n\r\nimage052\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Section XXII it has been already mentioned that according to the\r\ngeneral theory of relativity, a ray of light will experience a\r\ncurvature of its path when passing through a gravitational field, this\r\ncurvature being similar to that experienced by the path of a body which\r\nis projected through a gravitational field. As a result of this theory,\r\nwe should expect that a ray of light which is passing close to a\r\nheavenly body would be deviated towards the latter. For a ray of light\r\nwhich passes the sun at a distance of Δ sun-radii from its centre, the\r\nangle of deflection (α) should amount to\r\n\r\nimage053\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be added that, according to the theory, half of this deflection\r\nis produced by the Newtonian field of attraction of the sun, and the\r\nother half by the geometrical modification (“curvature”) of space\r\ncaused by the sun.\r\n\r\nThis result admits of an experimental test by means of the photographic\r\nregistration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun. The only\r\nreason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at every other\r\ntime the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by the light from the\r\nsun that the stars situated near the sun’s disc are invisible. The\r\npredicted effect can be seen clearly from the accompanying diagram. If\r\nthe sun (_S_) were not present, a star which is practically infinitely\r\ndistant would be seen in the direction _D_1, as observed front the\r\nearth. But as a consequence of the deflection of light from the star by\r\nthe sun, the star will be seen in the direction _D_2, _i.e._ at a\r\nsomewhat greater distance from the centre of the sun than corresponds\r\nto its real position.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the question is tested in the following way. The stars in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the sun are photographed during a solar eclipse.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a second photograph of the same stars is taken when the\r\nsun is situated at another position in the sky, _i.e._ a few months\r\nearlier or later. As compared with the standard photograph, the\r\npositions of the stars on the eclipse-photograph ought to appear\r\ndisplaced radially outwards (away from the centre of the sun) by an\r\namount corresponding to the angle _a_.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the [British] Royal Society and to the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society for the investigation of this important deduction.\r\nUndaunted by the [first world] war and by difficulties of both a\r\nmaterial and a psychological nature aroused by the war, these societies\r\nequipped two expeditions—to Sobral (Brazil), and to the island of\r\nPrincipe (West Africa)—and sent several of Britain’s most celebrated\r\nastronomers (Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin, Davidson), in order to\r\nobtain photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. The relative\r\ndiscrepancies to be expected between the stellar photographs obtained\r\nduring the eclipse and the comparison photographs amounted to a few\r\nhundredths of a millimetre only. Thus great accuracy was necessary in\r\nmaking the adjustments required for the taking of the photographs, and\r\nin their subsequent measurement.\r\n\r\nThe results of the measurements confirmed the theory in a thoroughly\r\nsatisfactory manner. The rectangular components of the observed and of\r\nthe calculated deviations of the stars (in seconds of arc) are set\r\nforth in the following table of results:\r\n\r\nimage054\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) Displacement of Spectral Lines Towards the Red\r\n\r\nIn Section XXIII it has been shown that in a system _K′_ which is in\r\nrotation with regard to a Galileian system _K_, clocks of identical\r\nconstruction, and which are considered at rest with respect to the\r\nrotating reference-body, go at rates which are dependent on the\r\npositions of the clocks. We shall now examine this dependence\r\nquantitatively. A clock, which is situated at a distance r from the\r\ncentre of the disc, has a velocity relative to _K_ which is given by\r\n\r\n_v_ = ω_r_,\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere ω represents the angular velocity of rotation of the disc _K′_\r\nwith respect to _K_. If _v_0, represents the number of ticks of the\r\nclock per unit time (“rate” of the clock) relative to _K_ when the\r\nclock is at rest, then the “rate” of the clock (_v_) when it is moving\r\nrelative to _K_ with a velocity _v_, but at rest with respect to the\r\ndisc, will, in accordance with Section XII, be given by\r\n\r\nimage055\r\n\r\n\r\nor with sufficient accuracy by\r\n\r\nimage056\r\n\r\n\r\nThis expression may also be stated in the following form:\r\n\r\nimage057\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we represent the difference of potential of the centrifugal force\r\nbetween the position of the clock and the centre of the disc by φ,\r\n_i.e._ the work, considered negatively, which must be performed on the\r\nunit of mass against the centrifugal force in order to transport it\r\nfrom the position of the clock on the rotating disc to the centre of\r\nthe disc, then we have\r\n\r\nimage058\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this it follows that\r\n\r\nimage059\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we see from this expression that two clocks of\r\nidentical construction will go at different rates when situated at\r\ndifferent distances from the centre of the disc. This result is also\r\nvalid from the standpoint of an observer who is rotating with the disc.\r\n\r\nNow, as judged from the disc, the latter is in a gravitational field of\r\npotential φ, hence the result we have obtained will hold quite\r\ngenerally for gravitational fields. Furthermore, we can regard an atom\r\nwhich is emitting spectral lines as a clock, so that the following\r\nstatement will hold:\r\n\r\n_An atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is dependent on\r\nthe potential of the gravitational field in which it is situated._\r\n\r\nThe frequency of an atom situated on the surface of a heavenly body\r\nwill be somewhat less than the frequency of an atom of the same element\r\nwhich is situated in free space (or on the surface of a smaller\r\ncelestial body).\r\n\r\nNow φ = – _K (M/r)_, where _K_ is Newton’s constant of gravitation, and\r\n_M_ is the mass of the heavenly body. Thus a displacement towards the\r\nred ought to take place for spectral lines produced at the surface of\r\nstars as compared with the spectral lines of the same element produced\r\nat the surface of the earth, the amount of this displacement being\r\n\r\nimage060\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the sun, the displacement towards the red predicted by theory\r\namounts to about two millionths of the wave-length. A trustworthy\r\ncalculation is not possible in the case of the stars, because in\r\ngeneral neither the mass _M_ nor the radius _r_ are known.\r\n\r\nIt is an open question whether or not this effect exists, and at the\r\npresent time (1920) astronomers are working with great zeal towards the\r\nsolution. Owing to the smallness of the effect in the case of the sun,\r\nit is difficult to form an opinion as to its existence. Whereas Grebe\r\nand Bachem (Bonn), as a result of their own measurements and those of\r\nEvershed and Schwarzschild on the cyanogen bands, have placed the\r\nexistence of the effect almost beyond doubt, while other investigators,\r\nparticularly St. John, have been led to the opposite opinion in\r\nconsequence of their measurements.\r\n\r\nMean displacements of lines towards the less refrangible end of the\r\nspectrum are certainly revealed by statistical investigations of the\r\nfixed stars; but up to the present the examination of the available\r\ndata does not allow of any definite decision being arrived at, as to\r\nwhether or not these displacements are to be referred in reality to the\r\neffect of gravitation. The results of observation have been collected\r\ntogether, and discussed in detail from the standpoint of the question\r\nwhich has been engaging our attention here, in a paper by E. Freundlich\r\nentitled “Zur Prüfung der allgemeinen Relativitäts-Theorie” (_Die\r\nNaturwissenschaften_, 1919, No. 35, p. 520: Julius Springer, Berlin).\r\n\r\nAt all events, a definite decision will be reached during the next few\r\nyears. If the displacement of spectral lines towards the red by the\r\ngravitational potential does not exist, then the general theory of\r\nrelativity will be untenable. On the other hand, if the cause of the\r\ndisplacement of spectral lines be definitely traced to the\r\ngravitational potential, then the study of this displacement will\r\nfurnish us with important information as to the mass of the heavenly\r\nbodies.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n [27] The displacement of spectral lines towards the red end of the\r\n spectrum was definitely established by Adams in 1924, by observations\r\n on the dense companion of Sirius, for which the effect is about thirty\r\n times greater than for the Sun. R.W.L.—translator\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\r\n\r\n(SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION XXXII)\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the first edition of this little book, our\r\nknowledge about the structure of space in the large (“cosmological\r\nproblem”) has had an important development, which ought to be mentioned\r\neven in a popular presentation of the subject.\r\n\r\nMy original considerations on the subject were based on two hypotheses:\r\n\r\n(1) There exists an average density of matter in the whole of space\r\nwhich is everywhere the same and different from zero.\r\n\r\n(2) The magnitude (“radius”) of space is independent of time.\r\n\r\nBoth these hypotheses proved to be consistent, according to the general\r\ntheory of relativity, but only after a hypothetical term was added to\r\nthe field equations, a term which was not required by the theory as\r\nsuch nor did it seem natural from a theoretical point of view\r\n(“cosmological term of the field equations”).\r\n\r\nHypothesis (2) appeared unavoidable to me at the time, since I thought\r\nthat one would get into bottomless speculations if one departed from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHowever, already in the ’twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman\r\nshowed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely\r\ntheoretical point of view. He realized that it was possible to preserve\r\nhypothesis (1) without introducing the less natural cosmological term\r\ninto the field equations of gravitation, if one was ready to drop\r\nhypothesis (2). Namely, the original field equations admit a solution\r\nin which the “world radius” depends on time (expanding space). In that\r\nsense one can say, according to Friedman, that the theory demands an\r\nexpansion of space.\r\n\r\nA few years later Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the\r\nextra-galactic nebulae (“milky ways”), that the spectral lines emitted\r\nshowed a red shift which increased regularly with the distance of the\r\nnebulae. This can be interpreted in regard to our present knowledge\r\nonly in the sense of Doppler’s principle, as an expansive motion of the\r\nsystem of stars in the large—as required, according to Friedman, by the\r\nfield equations of gravitation. Hubble’s discovery can, therefore, be\r\nconsidered to some extent as a confirmation of the theory.\r\n\r\nThere does arise, however, a strange difficulty. The interpretation of\r\nthe galactic line-shift discovered by Hubble as an expansion (which can\r\nhardly be doubted from a theoretical point of view), leads to an origin\r\nof this expansion which lies “only” about 109 years ago, while physical\r\nastronomy makes it appear likely that the development of individual\r\nstars and systems of stars takes considerably longer. It is in no way\r\nknown how this incongruity is to be overcome.\r\n\r\nI further want to remark that the theory of expanding space, together\r\nwith the empirical data of astronomy, permit no decision to be reached\r\nabout the finite or infinite character of (three-dimensional) space,\r\nwhile the original “static” hypothesis of space yielded the closure\r\n(finiteness) of space.\r\n\r\n_K_ = co-ordinate system\r\n\r\n_x, y_ = two-dimensional co-ordinates\r\n\r\n_x, y, z_ = three-dimensional co-ordinates\r\n\r\n_x, y, z, t_ = four-dimensional co-ordinates\r\n\r\n_t_ = time\r\n\r\n_I_ = distance\r\n\r\n_v_ = velocity\r\n\r\n_F_ = force\r\n\r\n_G_ = gravitational field",
